THE BLUE WALL\n\nI was born under the Blue Ridge, and under that side which is blue in\nthe evening light, in a wild land of game and forest and rushing waters.\nThere, on the borders of a creek that runs into the Yadkin River, in a\ncabin that was chinked with red mud, I came into the world a subject of\nKing George the Third, in that part of his realm known as the province\nof North Carolina.\n\nThe cabin reeked of corn-pone and bacon, and the odor of pelts. It had\ntwo shakedowns, on one of which I slept under a bearskin. A rough stone\nchimney was reared outside, and the fireplace was as long as my father\nwas tall. There was a crane in it, and a bake kettle; and over it great\nbuckhorns held my father’s rifle when it was not in use. On other horns\nhung jerked bear’s meat and venison hams, and gourds for drinking\ncups, and bags of seed, and my father’s best hunting shirt; also, in a\nneglected corner, several articles of woman’s attire from pegs. These\nonce belonged to my mother. Among them was a gown of silk, of a fine,\nfaded pattern, over which I was wont to speculate. The women at the\nCross-Roads, twelve miles away, were dressed in coarse butternut wool\nand huge sunbonnets. But when I questioned my father on these matters he\nwould give me no answers.\n\nMy father was--how shall I say what he was? To this day I can only\nsurmise many things of him. He was a Scotchman born, and I know now that\nhe had a slight Scotch accent. At the time of which I write, my early\nchildhood, he was a frontiersman and hunter. I can see him now, with his\nhunting shirt and leggings and moccasins; his powder horn, engraved with\nwondrous scenes; his bullet pouch and tomahawk and hunting knife. He\nwas a tall, lean man with a strange, sad face. And he talked little save\nwhen he drank too many “horns,” as they were called in that country.\nThese lapses of my father’s were a perpetual source of wonder to\nme,--and, I must say, of delight. They occurred only when a passing\ntraveller who hit his fancy chanced that way, or, what was almost as\nrare, a neighbor. Many a winter night I have lain awake under the\nskins, listening to a flow of language that held me spellbound, though I\nunderstood scarce a word of it.\n\n “Virtuous and vicious every man must be,\n Few in the extreme, but all in a degree.”\n\nThe chance neighbor or traveller was no less struck with wonder. And\nmany the time have I heard the query, at the Cross-Roads and elsewhere,\n“Whar Alec Trimble got his larnin’?”\n\nThe truth is, my father was an object of suspicion to the frontiersmen.\nEven as a child I knew this, and resented it. He had brought me up in\nsolitude, and I was old for my age, learned in some things far beyond\nmy years, and ignorant of others I should have known. I loved the man\npassionately. In the long winter evenings, when the howl of wolves and\n“painters” rose as the wind lulled, he taught me to read from the Bible\nand the “Pilgrim’s Progress.” I can see his long, slim fingers on the\npage. They seemed but ill fitted for the life he led.\n\nThe love of rhythmic language was somehow born into me, and many’s the\ntime I have held watch in the cabin day and night while my father was\naway on his hunts, spelling out the verses that have since become part\nof my life.\n\nAs I grew older I went with him into the mountains, often on his back;\nand spent the nights in open camp with my little moccasins drying at the\nblaze. So I learned to skin a bear, and fleece off the fat for oil with\nmy hunting knife; and cure a deerskin and follow a trail. At seven I\neven shot the long rifle, with a rest. I learned to endure cold and\nhunger and fatigue and to walk in silence over the mountains, my father\nnever saying a word for days at a spell. And often, when he opened his\nmouth, it would be to recite a verse of Pope’s in a way that moved me\nstrangely. For a poem is not a poem unless it be well spoken.\n\nIn the hot days of summer, over against the dark forest the bright green\nof our little patch of Indian corn rippled in the wind. And towards\nnight I would often sit watching the deep blue of the mountain wall and\ndream of the mysteries of the land that lay beyond. And by chance, one\nevening as I sat thus, my father reading in the twilight, a man stood\nbefore us. So silently had he come up the path leading from the brook\nthat we had not heard him. Presently my father looked up from his\nbook, but did not rise. As for me, I had been staring for some time in\nastonishment, for he was a better-looking man than I had ever seen. He\nwore a deerskin hunting shirt dyed black, but, in place of a coonskin\ncap with the tail hanging down, a hat. His long rifle rested on the\nground, and he held a roan horse by the bridle.\n\n“Howdy, neighbor?” said he.\n\nI recall a fear that my father would not fancy him. In such cases he\nwould give a stranger food, and leave him to himself. My father’s whims\nwere past understanding. But he got up.\n\n“Good evening,” said he.\n\nThe visitor looked a little surprised, as I had seen many do, at my\nfather’s accent.\n\n“Neighbor,” said he, “kin you keep me over night?”\n\n“Come in,” said my father.\n\nWe sat down to our supper of corn and beans and venison, of all of which\nour guest ate sparingly. He, too, was a silent man, and scarcely a word\nwas spoken during the meal. Several times he looked at me with such a\nkindly expression in his blue eyes, a trace of a smile around his broad\nmouth, that I wished he might stay with us always. But once, when my\nfather said something about Indians, the eyes grew hard as flint. It was\nthen I remarked, with a boy’s wonder, that despite his dark hair he had\nyellow eyebrows.\n\nAfter supper the two men sat on the log step, while I set about the task\nof skinning the deer my father had shot that day. Presently I felt a\nheavy hand on my shoulder.\n\n“What’s your name, lad?” he said.\n\nI told him Davy.\n\n“Davy, I’ll larn ye a trick worth a little time,” said he, whipping\nout a knife. In a trice the red carcass hung between the forked stakes,\nwhile I stood with my mouth open. He turned to me and laughed gently.\n\n“Some day you’ll cross the mountains and skin twenty of an evening,” he\nsaid. “Ye’ll make a woodsman sure. You’ve got the eye, and the hand.”\n\nThis little piece of praise from him made me hot all over.\n\n“Game rare?” said he to my father.\n\n“None sae good, now,” said my father.\n\n“I reckon not. My cabin’s on Beaver Creek some forty mile above, and\ngame’s going there, too.”\n\n“Settlements,” said my father. But presently, after a few whiffs of his\npipe, he added, “I hear fine things of this land across the mountains,\nthat the Indians call the Dark and Bluidy Ground.”\n\n“And well named,” said the stranger.\n\n“But a brave country,” said my father, “and all tramped down with game.\nI hear that Daniel Boone and others have gone into it and come back with\nmarvellous tales. They tell me Boone was there alone three months. He’s\nsaething of a man. D’ye ken him?”\n\nThe ruddy face of the stranger grew ruddier still.\n\n“My name’s Boone,” he said.\n\n“What!” cried my father, “it wouldn’t be Daniel?”\n\n“You’ve guessed it, I reckon.”\n\nMy father rose without a word, went into the cabin, and immediately\nreappeared with a flask and a couple of gourds, one of which he handed\nto our visitor.\n\n“Tell me aboot it,” said he.\n\nThat was the fairy tale of my childhood. Far into the night I lay on the\ndewy grass listening to Mr. Boone’s talk. It did not at first flow in a\nsteady stream, for he was not a garrulous man, but my father’s questions\npresently fired his enthusiasm. I recall but little of it, being so\nsmall a lad, but I crept closer and closer until I could touch this\nsuperior being who had been beyond the Wall. Marco Polo was no greater\nwonder to the Venetians than Boone to me.\n\nHe spoke of leaving wife and children, and setting out for the Unknown\nwith other woodsmen. He told how, crossing over our blue western wall\ninto a valley beyond, they found a “Warrior’s Path” through a gap across\nanother range, and so down into the fairest of promised lands. And as\nhe talked he lost himself in the tale of it, and the very quality of his\nvoice changed. He told of a land of wooded hill and pleasant vale, of\nclear water running over limestone down to the great river beyond, the\nOhio--a land of glades, the fields of which were pied with flowers of\nwondrous beauty, where roamed the buffalo in countless thousands, where\nelk and deer abounded, and turkeys and feathered game, and bear in the\ntall brakes of cane. And, simply, he told how, when the others had left\nhim, he stayed for three months roaming the hills alone with Nature\nherself.\n\n“But did you no’ meet the Indians?” asked my father.\n\n“I seed one fishing on a log once,” said our visitor, laughing, “but he\nfell into the water. I reckon he was drowned.”\n\nMy father nodded comprehendingly,--even admiringly.\n\n“And again!” said he.\n\n“Wal,” said Mr. Boone, “we fell in with a war party of Shawnees going\nback to their lands north of the great river. The critters took away all\nwe had. It was hard,” he added reflectively; “I had staked my fortune\non the venter, and we’d got enough skins to make us rich. But, neighbor,\nthere is land enough for you and me, as black and rich as Canaan.”\n\n“‘The Lord is my shepherd,’” said my father, lapsing into verse.\n“‘The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He leadeth me into green\npastures, and beside still waters.’”\n\nFor a time they were silent, each wrapped in his own thought, while the\ncrickets chirped and the frogs sang. From the distant forest came the\nmournful hoot of an owl.\n\n“And you are going back?” asked my father, presently.\n\n“Aye, that I am. There are many families on the Yadkin below going, too.\nAnd you, neighbor, you might come with us. Davy is the boy that would\nthrive in that country.”\n\nMy father did not answer. It was late indeed when we lay down to rest,\nand the night I spent between waking and dreaming of the wonderland\nbeyond the mountains, hoping against hope that my father would go. The\nsun was just flooding the slopes when our guest arose to leave, and my\nfather bade him God-speed with a heartiness that was rare to him. But,\nto my bitter regret, neither spoke of my father’s going. Being a man of\nunderstanding, Mr. Boone knew it were little use to press. He patted me\non the head.\n\n“You’re a wise lad, Davy,” said he. “I hope we shall meet again.”\n\nHe mounted his roan and rode away down the slope, waving his hand to\nus. And it was with a heavy heart that I went to feed our white mare,\nwhinnying for food in the lean-to.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. WARS AND RUMORS OF WARS\n\nAnd so our life went on the same, but yet not the same. For I had the\nLand of Promise to dream of, and as I went about my tasks I conjured\nup in my mind pictures of its beauty. You will forgive a backwoods\nboy,--self-centred, for lack of wider interest, and with a little\nimagination. Bear hunting with my father, and an occasional trip on\nthe white mare twelve miles to the Cross-Roads for salt and other\nnecessaries, were the only diversions to break the routine of my days.\nBut at the Cross-Roads, too, they were talking of Kaintuckee. For so the\nLand was called, the Dark and Bloody Ground.\n\nThe next year came a war on the Frontier, waged by Lord Dunmore,\nGovernor of Virginia. Of this likewise I heard at the Cross-Roads,\nthough few from our part seemed to have gone to it. And I heard there,\nfor rumors spread over mountains, that men blazing in the new land were\nin danger, and that my hero, Boone, was gone out to save them. But in\nthe autumn came tidings of a great battle far to the north, and of the\nIndians suing for peace.\n\nThe next year came more tidings of a sort I did not understand. I\nremember once bringing back from the Cross-Roads a crumpled newspaper,\nwhich my father read again and again, and then folded up and put in his\npocket. He said nothing to me of these things. But the next time I went\nto the Cross-Roads, the woman asked me:--\n\n“Is your Pa for the Congress?”\n\n“What’s that?” said I.\n\n“I reckon he ain’t,” said the woman, tartly. I recall her dimly, a\nslattern creature in a loose gown and bare feet, wife of the storekeeper\nand wagoner, with a swarm of urchins about her. They were all very\nnatural to me thus. And I remember a battle with one of these urchins in\nthe briers, an affair which did not add to the love of their family for\nours. There was no money in that country, and the store took our pelts\nin exchange for what we needed from civilization. Once a month would\nI load these pelts on the white mare, and make the journey by the path\ndown the creek. At times I met other settlers there, some of them not\nlong from Ireland, with the brogue still in their mouths. And again,\nI saw the wagoner with his great canvas-covered wagon standing at the\ndoor, ready to start for the town sixty miles away. ‘Twas he brought the\nnews of this latest war.\n\nOne day I was surprised to see the wagoner riding up the path to our\ncabin, crying out for my father, for he was a violent man. And a violent\nscene followed. They remained for a long time within the house, and when\nthey came out the wagoner’s face was red with rage. My father, too, was\nangry, but no more talkative than usual.\n\n“Ye say ye’ll not help the Congress?” shouted the wagoner.\n\n“I’ll not,” said my father.\n\n“Ye’ll live to rue this day, Alec Trimble,” cried the man. “Ye may think\nye’re too fine for the likes of us, but there’s them in the settlement\nthat knows about ye.”\n\nWith that he flung himself on his horse, and rode away. But the next\ntime I went to the Cross-Roads the woman drove me away with curses, and\ncalled me an aristocrat. Wearily I tramped back the dozen miles up the\ncreek, beside the mare, carrying my pelts with me; stumbling on the\nstones, and scratched by the dry briers. For it was autumn, the woods\nall red and yellow against the green of the pines. I sat down beside the\nold beaver dam to gather courage to tell my father. But he only smiled\nbitterly when he heard it. Nor would he tell me what the word aristocrat\nmeant.\n\nThat winter we spent without bacon, and our salt gave out at Christmas.\nIt was at this season, if I remember rightly, that we had another\nvisitor. He arrived about nightfall one gray day, his horse jaded and\ncut, and he was dressed all in wool, with a great coat wrapped about\nhim, and high boots. This made me stare at him. When my father drew back\nthe bolt of the door he, too, stared and fell back a step.\n\n“Come in,” said he.\n\n“D’ye ken me, Alec?” said the man.\n\nHe was a tall, spare man like my father, a Scotchman, but his hair was\nin a cue.\n\n“Come in, Duncan,” said my father, quietly. “Davy, run out for wood.”\n\nLoath as I was to go, I obeyed. As I came back dragging a log behind\nme I heard them in argument, and in their talk there was much about the\nCongress, and a woman named Flora Macdonald, and a British fleet sailing\nsouthward.\n\n“We’ll have two thousand Highlanders and more to meet the fleet. And\nye’ll sit at hame, in this hovel ye’ve made yeresel” (and he glanced\nabout disdainfully) “and no help the King?” He brought his fist down on\nthe pine boards.\n\n“Ye did no help the King greatly at Culloden, Duncan,” said my father,\ndryly.\n\nOur visitor did not answer at once.\n\n“The Yankee Rebels ‘ll no help the House of Stuart,” said he, presently.\n“And Hanover’s coom to stay. Are ye, too, a Rebel, Alec Ritchie?”\n\nI remember wondering why he said Ritchie.\n\n“I’ll no take a hand in this fight,” answered my father.\n\nAnd that was the end of it. The man left with scant ceremony, I guiding\nhim down the creek to the main trail. He did not open his mouth until I\nparted with him.\n\n“Puir Davy,” said he, and rode away in the night, for the moon shone\nthrough the clouds.\n\nI remember these things, I suppose, because I had nothing else to think\nabout. And the names stuck in my memory, intensified by later events,\nuntil I began to write a diary.\n\nAnd now I come to my travels. As the spring drew on I had had a feeling\nthat we could not live thus forever, with no market for our pelts. And\none day my father said to me abruptly:--\n\n“Davy, we’ll be travelling.”\n\n“Where?” I asked.\n\n“Ye’ll ken soon enough,” said he. “We’ll go at crack o’ day.”\n\nWe went away in the wild dawn, leaving the cabin desolate. We loaded the\nwhite mare with the pelts, and my father wore a woollen suit like that\nof our Scotch visitor, which I had never seen before. He had clubbed his\nhair. But, strangest of all, he carried in a small parcel the silk gown\nthat had been my mother’s. We had scant other baggage.\n\nWe crossed the Yadkin at a ford, and climbing the hills to the south of\nit we went down over stony traces, down and down, through rain and sun;\nstopping at rude cabins or taverns, until we came into the valley of\nanother river. This I know now was the Catawba. My memories of that ride\nare as misty as the spring weather in the mountains. But presently the\ncountry began to open up into broad fields, some of these abandoned to\npines. And at last, splashing through the stiff red clay that was up to\nthe mare’s fetlocks, we came to a place called Charlotte Town. What a\nday that was for me! And how I gaped at the houses there, finer than\nany I had ever dreamed of! That was my first sight of a town. And how I\nlistened open-mouthed to the gentlemen at the tavern! One I recall had a\nfighting head with a lock awry, and a negro servant to wait on him, and\nwas the principal spokesman. He, too, was talking of war. The Cherokees\nhad risen on the western border. He was telling of the massacre of a\nsettlement, in no mild language.\n\n“Sirs,” he cried, “the British have stirred the redskins to this. Will\nyou sit here while women and children are scalped, and those devils” (he\ncalled them worse names) “Stuart and Cameron go unpunished?”\n\nMy father got up from the corner where he sat, and stood beside the man.\n\n“I ken Alec Cameron,” said he.\n\nThe man looked at him with amazement.\n\n“Ay?” said he, “I shouldn’t think you’d own it. Damn him,” he cried, “if\nwe catch him we’ll skin him alive.”\n\n“I ken Cameron,” my father repeated, “and I’ll gang with you to skin him\nalive.”\n\nThe man seized his hand and wrung it.\n\n“But first I must be in Charlestown,” said my father.\n\nThe next morning we sold our pelts. And though the mare was tired,\nwe pushed southward, I behind the saddle. I had much to think about,\nwondering what was to become of me while my father went to skin Cameron.\nI had not the least doubt that he would do it. The world is a storybook\nto a lad of nine, and the thought of Charlestown filled me with a\ndelight unspeakable. Perchance he would leave me in Charlestown.\n\nAt nightfall we came into a settlement called the Waxhaws. And there\nbeing no tavern there, and the mare being very jaded and the roads\nheavy, we cast about for a place to sleep. The sunlight slanting over\nthe pine forest glistened on the pools in the wet fields. And it so\nchanced that splashing across these, swinging a milk-pail over his head,\nshouting at the top of his voice, was a red-headed lad of my own age. My\nfather hailed him, and he came running towards us, still shouting, and\nvaulted the rails. He stood before us, eying me with a most mischievous\nlook in his blue eyes, and dabbling in the red mud with his toes. I\nremember I thought him a queer-looking boy. He was lanky, and he had a\nvery long face under his tousled hair.\n\nMy father asked him where he could spend the night.\n\n“Wal,” said the boy, “I reckon Uncle Crawford might take you in. And\nagain he mightn’t.”\n\nHe ran ahead, still swinging the pail. And we, following, came at length\nto a comfortable-looking farmhouse. As we stopped at the doorway a\nstout, motherly woman filled it. She held her knitting in her hand.\n\n“You Andy!” she cried, “have you fetched the milk?”\n\nAndy tried to look repentant.\n\n“I declare I’ll tan you,” said the lady. “Git out this instant. What\nrascality have you been in?”\n\n“I fetched home visitors, Ma,” said Andy.\n\n“Visitors!” cried the lady. “What ‘ll your Uncle Crawford say?\" And she\nlooked at us smiling, but with no great hostility.\n\n“Pardon me, Madam,” said my father, “if we seem to intrude. But my mare\nis tired, and we have nowhere to stay.”\n\nUncle Crawford did take us in. He was a man of substance in that\ncountry,--a north of Ireland man by birth, if I remember right.\n\nI went to bed with the red-headed boy, whose name was Andy Jackson. I\nremember that his mother came into our little room under the eaves and\nmade Andy say his prayers, and me after him. But when she was gone\nout, Andy stumped his toe getting into bed in the dark and swore with a\nbrilliancy and vehemence that astonished me.\n\nIt was some hours before we went to sleep, he plying me with questions\nabout my life, which seemed to interest him greatly, and I returning in\nkind.\n\n“My Pa’s dead,” said Andy. “He came from a part of Ireland where they\nare all weavers. We’re kinder poor relations here. Aunt Crawford’s\nsick, and Ma keeps house. But Uncle Crawford’s good, an’ lets me go to\nCharlotte Town with him sometimes.”\n\nI recall that he also boasted some about his big brothers, who were away\njust then.\n\nAndy was up betimes in the morning, to see us start. But we didn’t\nstart, because Mr. Crawford insisted that the white mare should have a\nhalf day’s rest. Andy, being hustled off unwillingly to the “Old Field”\n school, made me go with him. He was a very headstrong boy.\n\nI was very anxious to see a school. This one was only a log house in a\npoor, piny place, with a rabble of boys and girls romping at the door.\nBut when they saw us they stopped. Andy jumped into the air, let out a\nwar-whoop, and flung himself into the midst, scattering them right and\nleft, and knocking one boy over and over. “I’m Billy Buck!” he cried.\n“I’m a hull regiment o’ Rangers. Let th’ Cherokees mind me!”\n\n“Way for Sandy Andy!” cried the boys. “Where’d you get the new boy,\nSandy?”\n\n“His name’s Davy,” said Andy, “and his Pa’s goin’ to fight the\nCherokees. He kin lick tarnation out’n any o’ you.”\n\nMeanwhile I held back, never having been thrown with so many of my own\nkind.\n\n“He’s shot painters and b’ars,” said Andy. “An’ skinned ‘em. Kin you\nlick him, Smally? I reckon not.”\n\nNow I had not come to the school for fighting. So I held back.\nFortunately for me, Smally held back also. But he tried skilful tactics.\n\n“He kin throw you, Sandy.”\n\nAndy faced me in an instant.\n\n“Kin you?” said he.\n\nThere was nothing to do but try, and in a few seconds we were rolling on\nthe ground, to the huge delight of Smally and the others, Andy shouting\nall the while and swearing. We rolled and rolled and rolled in the mud,\nuntil we both lost our breath, and even Andy stopped swearing, for want\nof it. After a while the boys were silent, and the thing became grim\nearnest. At length, by some accident rather than my own strength, both\nhis shoulders touched the ground. I released him. But he was on his feet\nin an instant and at me again like a wildcat.\n\n“Andy won’t stay throwed,” shouted a boy. And before I knew it he had\nmy shoulders down in a puddle. Then I went for him, and affairs were\ngrowing more serious than a wrestle, when Smally, fancying himself safe,\nand no doubt having a grudge, shouted out:--\n\n“Tell him he slobbers, Davy.”\n\nAndy did slobber. But that was the end of me, and the beginning of\nSmally. Andy left me instantly, not without an intimation that he\nwould come back, and proceeded to cover Smally with red clay and blood.\nHowever, in the midst of this turmoil the schoolmaster arrived,\nhaled both into the schoolhouse, held court, and flogged Andrew with\nconsiderable gusto. He pronounced these words afterwards, with great\nsolemnity:--\n\n“Andrew Jackson, if I catch ye fightin’ once more, I’ll be afther givin’\nye lave to lave the school.”\n\nI parted from Andy at noon with real regret. He was the first boy with\nwhom I had ever had any intimacy. And I admired him: chiefly, I fear,\nfor his fluent use of profanity and his fighting qualities. He was a\nmerry lad, with a wondrous quick temper but a good heart. And he seemed\nsorry to say good-by. He filled my pockets with June apples--unripe, by\nthe way--and told me to remember him when I got till Charlestown.\n\nI remembered him much longer than that, and usually with a shock of\nsurprise.\n\n\nCHAPTER III. CHARLESTOWN\n\nDown and down we went, crossing great rivers by ford and ferry, until\nthe hills flattened themselves and the country became a long stretch\nof level, broken by the forests only; and I saw many things I had not\nthought were on the earth. Once in a while I caught glimpses of great\nred houses, with stately pillars, among the trees. They put me in mind\nof the palaces in Bunyan, their windows all golden in the morning sun;\nand as we jogged ahead, I pondered on the delights within them. I saw\ngangs of negroes plodding to work along the road, an overseer riding\nbehind them with his gun on his back; and there were whole cotton fields\nin these domains blazing in primrose flower,--a new plant here, so my\nfather said. He was willing to talk on such subjects. But on others, and\nespecially our errand to Charlestown, he would say nothing. And I knew\nbetter than to press him.\n\nOne day, as we were crossing a dike between rice swamps spread with\ndelicate green, I saw the white tops of wagons flashing in the sun at\nthe far end of it. We caught up with them, the wagoners cracking their\nwhips and swearing at the straining horses. And lo! in front of the\nwagons was an army,--at least my boyish mind magnified it to such. Men\nclad in homespun, perspiring and spattered with mud, were straggling\nalong the road by fours, laughing and joking together. The officers\nrode, and many of these had blue coats and buff waistcoats,--some the\nworse for wear. My father was pushing the white mare into the ditch to\nride by, when one hailed him.\n\n“Hullo, my man,” said he, “are you a friend to Congress?”\n\n“I’m off to Charlestown to leave the lad,” said my father, “and then to\nfight the Cherokees.”\n\n“Good,” said the other. And then, “Where are you from?”\n\n“Upper Yadkin,” answered my father. “And you?”\n\nThe officer, who was a young man, looked surprised. But then he laughed\npleasantly.\n\n“We’re North Carolina troops, going to join Lee in Charlestown,” said\nhe. “The British are sending a fleet and regiments against it.”\n\n“Oh, aye,” said my father, and would have passed on. But he was made to\ngo before the Colonel, who plied him with many questions. Then he gave\nus a paper and dismissed us.\n\nWe pursued our journey through the heat that shimmered up from the road,\npausing now and again in the shade of a wayside tree. At times I thought\nI could bear the sun no longer. But towards four o’clock of that day\na great bank of yellow cloud rolled up, darkening the earth save for\na queer saffron light that stained everything, and made our very faces\nyellow. And then a wind burst out of the east with a high mournful note,\nas from a great flute afar, filling the air with leaves and branches of\ntrees. But it bore, too, a savor that was new to me,--a salt savor, deep\nand fresh, that I drew down into my lungs. And I knew that we were near\nthe ocean. Then came the rain, in great billows, as though the ocean\nitself were upon us.\n\nThe next day we crossed a ferry on the Ashley River, and rode down the\nsand of Charlestown neck. And my most vivid remembrance is of the great\ntrunks towering half a hundred feet in the air, with a tassel of leaves\nat the top, which my father said were palmettos. Something lay heavy\non his mind. For I had grown to know his moods by a sort of silent\nunderstanding. And when the roofs and spires of the town shone over the\nfoliage in the afternoon sun, I felt him give a great sigh that was like\na sob.\n\nAnd how shall I describe the splendor of that city? The sandy streets,\nand the gardens of flower and shade, heavy with the plant odors; and the\ngreat houses with their galleries and porticos set in the midst of the\ngardens, that I remember staring at wistfully. But before long we\ncame to a barricade fixed across the street, and then to another. And\npresently, in an open space near a large building, was a company of\nsoldiers at drill.\n\nIt did not strike me as strange then that my father asked his way of no\nman, but went to a little ordinary in a humbler part of the town. After\na modest meal in a corner of the public room, we went out for a stroll.\nThen, from the wharves, I saw the bay dotted with islands, their white\nsand sparkling in the evening light, and fringed with strange trees,\nand beyond, of a deepening blue, the ocean. And nearer,--greatest of\nall delights to me,--riding on the swell was a fleet of ships. My father\ngazed at them long and silently, his palm over his eyes.\n\n“Men-o’-war from the old country, lad,” he said after a while. “They’re\na brave sight.”\n\n“And why are they here?” I asked.\n\n“They’ve come to fight,” said he, “and take the town again for the\nKing.”\n\nIt was twilight when we turned to go, and then I saw that many of the\nwarehouses along the wharves were heaps of ruins. My father said this\nwas that the town might be the better defended.\n\nWe bent our way towards one of the sandy streets where the great houses\nwere. And to my surprise we turned in at a gate, and up a path leading\nto the high steps of one of these. Under the high portico the door was\nopen, but the house within was dark. My father paused, and the hand he\nheld to mine trembled. Then he stepped across the threshold, and raising\nthe big polished knocker that hung on the panel, let it drop. The sound\nreverberated through the house, and then stillness. And then, from\nwithin, a shuffling sound, and an old negro came to the door. For an\ninstant he stood staring through the dusk, and broke into a cry.\n\n“Marse Alec!” he said.\n\n“Is your master at home?” said my father.\n\nWithout another word he led us through a deep hall, and out into a\ngallery above the trees of a back garden, where a gentleman sat smoking\na long pipe. The old negro stopped in front of him.\n\n“Marse John,” said he, his voice shaking, “heah’s Marse Alec done come\nback.”\n\nThe gentleman got to his feet with a start. His pipe fell to the floor,\nand the ashes scattered on the boards and lay glowing there.\n\n“Alec!” he cried, peering into my father’s face, “Alec! You’re not\ndead.”\n\n“John,” said my father, “can we talk here?”\n\n“Good God!” said the gentleman, “you’re just the same. To think of\nit--to think of it! Breed, a light in the drawing-room.”\n\nThere was no word spoken while the negro was gone, and the time seemed\nvery long. But at length he returned, a silver candlestick in each hand.\n\n“Careful,” cried the gentleman, petulantly, “you’ll drop them.”\n\nHe led the way into the house, and through the hall to a massive door of\nmahogany with a silver door-knob. The grandeur of the place awed me,\nand well it might. Boylike, I was absorbed in this. Our little mountain\ncabin would almost have gone into this one room. The candles threw their\nflickering rays upward until they danced on the high ceiling. Marvel\nof marvels, in the oval left clear by the heavy, rounded cornice was a\npicture.\n\nThe negro set down the candles on the marble top of a table. But the air\nof the room was heavy and close, and the gentleman went to a window and\nflung it open. It came down instantly with a crash, so that the panes\nrattled again.\n\n“Curse these Rebels,” he shouted, “they’ve taken our window weights to\nmake bullets.”\n\nCalling to the negro to pry open the window with a walking-stick, he\nthrew himself into a big, upholstered chair. ‘Twas then I remarked the\nsplendor of his clothes, which were silk. And he wore a waistcoat all\nsewed with flowers. With a boy’s intuition, I began to dislike him\nintensely.\n\n“Damn the Rebels!” he began. “They’ve driven his Lordship away. I hope\nhis Majesty will hang every mother’s son of ‘em. All pleasure of life is\ngone, and they’ve folly enough to think they can resist the fleet. And\nthe worst of it is,” cried he, “the worst of it is, I’m forced to smirk\nto them, and give good gold to their government.” Seeing that my father\ndid not answer, he asked: “Have you joined the Highlanders? You were\nalways for fighting.”\n\n“I’m to be at Cherokee Ford on the twentieth,” said my father. “We’re to\nscalp the redskins and Cameron, though ‘tis not known.”\n\n“Cameron!” shrieked the gentleman. “But that’s the other side, man!\nAgainst his Majesty?”\n\n“One side or t’other,” said my father, “‘tis all one against Alec\nCameron.”\n\nThe gentleman looked at my father with something like terror in his\neyes.\n\n“You’ll never forgive Cameron,” he said.\n\n“I’ll no forgive anybody who does me a wrong,” said my father.\n\n“And where have you been all these years, Alec?” he asked presently.\n“Since you went off with--”\n\n“I’ve been in the mountains, leading a pure life,” said my father. “And\nwe’ll speak of nothing, if you please, that’s gone by.”\n\n“And what will you have me do?” said the gentleman, helplessly.\n\n“Little enough,” said my father. “Keep the lad till I come again. He’s\nquiet. He’ll no trouble you greatly. Davy, this is Mr. Temple. You’re to\nstay with him till I come again.”\n\n“Come here, lad,” said the gentleman, and he peered into my face.\n“You’ll not resemble your mother.”\n\n“He’ll resemble no one,” said my father, shortly. “Good-by, Davy. Keep\nthis till I come again.” And he gave me the parcel made of my mother’s\ngown. Then he lifted me in his strong arms and kissed me, and strode\nout of the house. We listened in silence as he went down the steps, and\nuntil his footsteps died away on the path. Then the gentleman rose and\npulled a cord hastily. The negro came in.\n\n“Put the lad to bed, Breed,” said he.\n\n“Whah, suh?”\n\n“Oh, anywhere,” said the master. He turned to me. “I’ll be better able\nto talk to you in the morning, David,” said he.\n\nI followed the old servant up the great stairs, gulping down a sob that\nwould rise, and clutching my mother’s gown tight under my arm. Had my\nfather left me alone in our cabin for a fortnight, I should not have\nminded. But here, in this strange house, amid such strange surroundings,\nI was heartbroken. The old negro was very kind. He led me into a little\nbedroom, and placing the candle on a polished dresser, he regarded me\nwith sympathy.\n\n“So you’re Miss Lizbeth’s boy,” said he. “An’ she dade. An’ Marse Alec\nrough an’ hard es though he been bo’n in de woods. Honey, ol’ Breed ‘ll\ntek care ob you. I’ll git you one o’ dem night rails Marse Nick has, and\nsome ob his’n close in de mawnin’.”\n\nThese things I remember, and likewise sobbing myself to sleep in the\nfour-poster. Often since I have wished that I had questioned Breed\nof many things on which I had no curiosity then, for he was my chief\ncompanion in the weeks that followed. He awoke me bright and early the\nnext day.\n\n“Heah’s some close o’ Marse Nick’s you kin wear, honey,” he said.\n\n“Who is Master Nick?” I asked.\n\nBreed slapped his thigh.\n\n“Marse Nick Temple, Marsa’s son. He’s ‘bout you size, but he ain’ no mo’\nlaik you den a jack rabbit’s laik an’ owl. Dey ain’ none laik Marse Nick\nfo’ gittin’ into trouble--and gittin’ out agin.”\n\n“Where is he now?” I asked.\n\n“He at Temple Bow, on de Ashley Ribber. Dat’s de Marsa’s barony.”\n\n“His what?”\n\n“De place whah he lib at, in de country.”\n\n“And why isn’t the master there?”\n\nI remember that Breed gave a wink, and led me out of the window onto a\ngallery above the one where we had found the master the night before.\nHe pointed across the dense foliage of the garden to a strip of water\ngleaming in the morning sun beyond.\n\n“See dat boat?” said the negro. “Sometime de Marse he tek ar ride in dat\nboat at night. Sometime gentlemen comes heah in a pow’ful hurry to git\naway, out’n de harbor whah de English is at.”\n\nBy that time I was dressed, and marvellously uncomfortable in Master\nNick’s clothes. But as I was going out of the door, Breed hailed me.\n\n“Marse Dave,”--it was the first time I had been called that,--“Marse\nDave, you ain’t gwineter tell?”\n\n“Tell what?” I asked.\n\n“Bout’n de boat, and Marsa agwine away nights.”\n\n“No,” said I, indignantly.\n\n“I knowed you wahn’t,” said Breed. “You don’ look as if you’d tell\nanything.”\n\nWe found the master pacing the lower gallery. At first he barely glanced\nat me, and nodded. After a while he stopped, and began to put to me many\nquestions about my life: when and how I had lived. And to some of my\nanswers he exclaimed, “Good God!” That was all. He was a handsome man,\nwith hands like a woman’s, well set off by the lace at his sleeves. He\nhad fine-cut features, and the white linen he wore was most becoming.\n\n“David,” said he, at length, and I noted that he lowered his voice,\n“David, you seem a discreet lad. Pay attention to what I tell you. And\nmark! if you disobey me, you will be well whipped. You have this house\nand garden to play in, but you are by no means to go out at the front of\nthe house. And whatever you may see or hear, you are to tell no one. Do\nyou understand?”\n\n“Yes, sir,” I said.\n\n“For the rest,” said he, “Breed will give you food, and look out for\nyour welfare.”\n\nAnd so he dismissed me. They were lonely days after that for a boy used\nto activity, and only the damp garden paths and lawns to run on. The\ncreek at the back of the garden was stagnant and marshy when the water\nfell, and overhung by leafy boughs. On each side of the garden was a\nhigh brick wall. And though I was often tempted to climb it, I felt\nthat disobedience was disloyalty to my father. Then there was the great\nhouse, dark and lonely in its magnificence, over which I roamed until I\nknew every corner of it.\n\nI was most interested of all in the pictures of men and women in quaint,\nold-time costumes, and I used during the great heat of the day to sit in\nthe drawing-room and study these, and wonder who they were and when they\nlived. Another amusement I had was to climb into the deep windows\nand peer through the blinds across the front garden into the street.\nSometimes men stopped and talked loudly there, and again a rattle of\ndrums would send me running to see the soldiers. I recall that I had a\npoor enough notion of what the fighting was all about. And no wonder.\nBut I remember chiefly my insatiable longing to escape from this prison,\nas the great house soon became for me. And I yearned with a yearning I\ncannot express for our cabin in the hills and the old life there.\n\nI caught glimpses of the master on occasions only, and then I avoided\nhim; for I knew he had no wish to see me. Sometimes he would be seated\nin the gallery, tapping his foot on the floor, and sometimes pacing the\ngarden walks with his hands opening and shutting. And one night I awoke\nwith a start, and lay for a while listening until I heard something like\na splash, and the scraping of the bottom-boards of a boat. Irresistibly\nI jumped out of bed, and running to the gallery rail I saw two dark\nfigures moving among the leaves below. The next morning I came suddenly\non a strange gentleman in the gallery. He wore a flowered dressing-gown\nlike the one I had seen on the master, and he had a jolly, round face. I\nstopped and stared.\n\n“Who the devil are you?” said he, but not unkindly.\n\n“My name is David Trimble,” said I, “and I come from the mountains.”\n\nHe laughed.\n\n“Mr. David Trimble-from-the-mountains, who the devil am I?”\n\n“I don’t know, sir,” and I started to go away, not wishing to disturb\nhim.\n\n“Avast!” he cried. “Stand fast. See that you remember that.”\n\n“I’m not here of my free will, sir, but because my father wishes it. And\nI’ll betray nothing.”\n\nThen he stared at me.\n\n“How old did you say you were?” he demanded.\n\n“I didn’t say,” said I.\n\n“And you are of Scotch descent?” said he.\n\n“I didn’t say so, sir.”\n\n“You’re a rum one,” said he, laughing again, and he disappeared into the\nhouse.\n\nThat day, when Breed brought me my dinner on my gallery, he did not\nspeak of a visitor. You may be sure I did not mention the circumstance.\nBut Breed always told me the outside news.\n\n“Dey’s gittin’ ready fo’ a big fight, Marse Dave,” said he. “Mister\nMoultrie in the fo’t in de bay, an’ Marse Gen’l Lee tryin’ for to boss\nhim. Dey’s Rebels. An’ Marse Admiral Parker an’ de King’s reg’ments\nfixin’ fo’ to tek de fo’t, an’ den Charlesto’n. Dey say Mister Moultrie\nain’t got no mo’ chance dan a treed ‘possum.”\n\n“Why, Breed?” I asked. I had heard my father talk of England’s power and\nmight, and Mister Moultrie seemed to me a very brave man in his little\nfort.\n\n“Why!” exclaimed the old negro. “You ain’t neber read no hist’ry books.\nI knows some of de gentlemen wid Mister Moultrie. Dey ain’t no soldiers.\nSome is fine gentlemen, to be suah, but it’s jist foolishness to fight\ndat fleet an’ army. Marse Gen’l Lee hisself, he done sesso. I heerd\nhim.”\n\n“And he’s on Mister Moultrie’s side?” I asked.\n\n“Sholy,” said Breed. “He’s de Rebel gen’l.”\n\n“Then he’s a knave and a coward!” I cried with a boy’s indignation.\n“Where did you hear him say that?” I demanded, incredulous of some of\nBreed’s talk.\n\n“Right heah in dis house,” he answered, and quickly clapped his hand to\nhis mouth, and showed the whites of his eyes. “You ain’t agwineter tell\ndat, Marse Dave?”\n\n“Of course not,” said I. And then: “I wish I could see Mister Moultrie\nin his fort, and the fleet.”\n\n“Why, honey, so you kin,” said Breed.\n\nThe good-natured negro dropped his work and led the way upstairs, I\nfollowing expectant, to the attic. A rickety ladder rose to a kind of\ntower (cupola, I suppose it would be called), whence the bay spread out\nbefore me like a picture, the white islands edged with the whiter lacing\nof the waves. There, indeed, was the fleet, but far away, like toy ships\non the water, and the bit of a fort perched on the sandy edge of an\nisland. I spent most of that day there, watching anxiously for some\nmovement. But none came.\n\nThat night I was again awakened. And running into the gallery, I heard\nquick footsteps in the garden. Then there was a lantern’s flash, a\nsmothered oath, and all was dark again. But in the flash I had seen\ndistinctly three figures. One was Breed, and he held the lantern;\nanother was the master; and the third, a stout one muffled in a cloak,\nI made no doubt was my jolly friend. I lay long awake, with a boy’s\ncuriosity, until presently the dawn broke, and I arose and dressed, and\nbegan to wander about the house. No Breed was sweeping the gallery, nor\nwas there any sign of the master. The house was as still as a tomb, and\nthe echoes of my footsteps rolled through the halls and chambers. At\nlast, prompted by curiosity and fear, I sought the kitchen, where I had\noften sat with Breed as he cooked the master’s dinner. This was at the\nbottom and end of the house. The great fire there was cold, and the pots\nand pans hung neatly on their hooks, untouched that day. I was running\nthrough the wet garden, glad to be out in the light, when a sound\nstopped me.\n\nIt was a dull roar from the direction of the bay. Almost instantly came\nanother, and another, and then several broke together. And I knew that\nthe battle had begun. Forgetting for the moment my loneliness, I ran\ninto the house and up the stairs two at a time, and up the ladder into\nthe cupola, where I flung open the casement and leaned out.\n\nThere was the battle indeed,--a sight so vivid to me after all\nthese years that I can call it again before me when I will. The toy\nmen-o’-war, with sails set, ranging in front of the fort. They looked\nat my distance to be pressed against it. White puffs, like cotton balls,\nwould dart one after another from a ship’s side, melt into a cloud,\nfloat over her spars, and hide her from my view. And then presently the\nroar would reach me, and answering puffs along the line of the fort.\nAnd I could see the mortar shells go up and up, leaving a scorched trail\nbehind, curve in a great circle, and fall upon the little garrison.\nMister Moultrie became a real person to me then, a vivid picture in my\nboyish mind--a hero beyond all other heroes.\n\nAs the sun got up in the heavens and the wind fell, the cupola became\na bake-oven. But I scarcely felt the heat. My whole soul was out in the\nbay, pent up with the men in the fort. How long could they hold out? Why\nwere they not all killed by the shot that fell like hail among them? Yet\npuff after puff sprang from their guns, and the sound of it was like a\nstorm coming nearer in the heat. But at noon it seemed to me as though\nsome of the ships were sailing. It was true. Slowly they drew away from\nthe others, and presently I thought they had stopped again. Surely two\nof them were stuck together, then three were fast on a shoal. Boats,\nlike black bugs in the water, came and went between them and the others.\nAfter a long time the two that were together got apart and away. But the\nthird stayed there, immovable, helpless.\n\nThroughout the afternoon the fight kept on, the little black boats\ncoming and going. I saw a mast totter and fall on one of the ships. I\nsaw the flag shot away from the fort, and reappear again. But now the\npuffs came from her walls slowly and more slowly, so that my heart sank\nwith the setting sun. And presently it grew too dark to see aught save\nthe red flashes. Slowly, reluctantly, the noise died down until at last\na great silence reigned, broken only now and again by voices in the\nstreets below me. It was not until then that I realized that I had been\nall day without food--that I was alone in the dark of a great house.\n\nI had never known fear in the woods at night. But now I trembled as I\nfelt my way down the ladder, and groped and stumbled through the black\nattic for the stairs. Every noise I made seemed louder an hundred fold\nthan the battle had been, and when I barked my shins, the pain was\nsharper than a knife. Below, on the big stairway, the echo of my\nfootsteps sounded again from the empty rooms, so that I was taken with a\npanic and fled downward, sliding and falling, until I reached the hall.\nFrantically as I tried, I could not unfasten the bolts on the front\ndoor. And so, running into the drawing-room, I pried open the window,\nand sat me down in the embrasure to think, and to try to quiet the\nthumpings of my heart.\n\nBy degrees I succeeded. The still air of the night and the heavy, damp\nodors of the foliage helped me. And I tried to think what was right for\nme to do. I had promised the master not to leave the place, and that\npromise seemed in pledge to my father. Surely the master would come\nback--or Breed. They would not leave me here alone without food much\nlonger. Although I was young, I was brought up to responsibility. And I\ninherited a conscience that has since given me much trouble.\n\nFrom these thoughts, trying enough for a starved lad, I fell to thinking\nof my father on the frontier fighting the Cherokees. And so I dozed away\nto dream of him. I remember that he was skinning Cameron,--I had often\npictured it,--and Cameron yelling, when I was awakened with a shock by a\ngreat noise.\n\nI listened with my heart in my throat. The noise seemed to come from the\nhall,--a prodigious pounding. Presently it stopped, and a man’s voice\ncried out:--\n\n“Ho there, within!”\n\nMy first impulse was to answer. But fear kept me still.\n\n“Batter down the door,” some one shouted.\n\nThere was a sound of shuffling in the portico, and the same voice:--\n\n“Now then, all together, lads!”\n\nThen came a straining and splitting of wood, and with a crash the door\ngave way. A lantern’s rays shot through the hall.\n\n“The house is as dark as a tomb,” said a voice.\n\n“And as empty, I reckon,” said another. “John Temple and his spy have\ngot away.”\n\n“We’ll have a search,” answered the first voice.\n\nThey stood for a moment in the drawing-room door, peering, and then they\nentered. There were five of them. Two looked to be gentlemen, and three\nwere of rougher appearance. They carried lanterns.\n\n“That window’s open,” said one of the gentlemen. “They must have been\nhere to-day. Hello, what’s this?” He started back in surprise.\n\nI slid down from the window-seat, and stood facing them, not knowing\nwhat else to do. They, too, seemed equally confounded.\n\n“It must be Temple’s son,” said one, at last. “I had thought the family\nat Temple Bow. What’s your name, my lad?”\n\n“David Trimble, sir,” said I.\n\n“And what are you doing here?” he asked more sternly.\n\n“I was left in Mr. Temple’s care by my father.”\n\n“Oho!” he cried. “And where is your father?”\n\n“He’s gone to fight the Cherokees,” I answered soberly. “To skin a man\nnamed Cameron.”\n\nAt that they were silent for an instant, and then the two broke into a\nlaugh.\n\n“Egad, Lowndes,” said the gentleman, “here is a fine mystery. Do you\nthink the boy is lying?”\n\nThe other gentleman scratched his forehead.\n\n“I’ll have you know I don’t lie, sir,” I said, ready to cry.\n\n“No,” said the other gentleman. “A backwoodsman named Trimble went\nto Rutledge with credentials from North Carolina, and has gone off to\nCherokee Ford to join McCall.”\n\n“Bless my soul!” exclaimed the first gentleman. He came up and laid his\nhand on my shoulder, and said:--\n\n“Where is Mr. Temple?”\n\n“That I don’t know, sir.”\n\n“When did he go away?”\n\nI did not answer at once.\n\n“That I can’t tell you, sir.”\n\n“Was there any one with him?”\n\n“That I can’t tell you, sir.”\n\n“The devil you can’t!” he cried, taking his hand away. “And why not?”\n\nI shook my head, sorely beset.\n\n“Come, Mathews,” cried the gentleman called Lowndes. “We’ll search\nfirst, and attend to the lad after.”\n\nAnd so they began going through the house, prying into every cupboard\nand sweeping under every bed. They even climbed to the attic; and noting\nthe open casement in the cupola, Mr. Lowndes said:--\n\n“Some one has been here to-day.”\n\n“It was I, sir,” I said. “I have been here all day.”\n\n“And what doing, pray?” he demanded.\n\n“Watching the battle. And oh, sir,” I cried, “can you tell me whether\nMister Moultrie beat the British?”\n\n“He did so,” cried Mr. Lowndes. “He did, and soundly.”\n\nHe stared at me. I must have looked my pleasure.\n\n“Why, David,” says he, “you are a patriot, too.”\n\n“I am a Rebel, sir,” I cried hotly.\n\nBoth gentlemen laughed again, and the men with them.\n\n“The lad is a character,” said Mr. Lowndes.\n\nWe made our way down into the garden, which they searched last. At the\ncreek’s side the boat was gone, and there were footsteps in the mud.\n\n“The bird has flown, Lowndes,” said Mr. Mathews.\n\n“And good riddance for the Committee,” answered that gentleman,\nheartily. “He got to the fleet in fine season to get a round shot in the\nmiddle. David,” said he, solemnly, “remember it never pays to try to be\ntwo things at once.”\n\n“I’ll warrant he stayed below water,” said Mr. Mathews. “But what shall\nwe do with the lad?”\n\n“I’ll take him to my house for the night,” said Mr. Lowndes, “and in the\nmorning we’ll talk to him. I reckon he should be sent to Temple Bow. He\nis connected in some way with the Temples.”\n\n“God help him if he goes there,” said Mr. Mathews, under his breath. But\nI heard him.\n\nThey locked up the house, and left one of the men to guard it, while\nI went with Mr. Lowndes to his residence. I remember that people were\ngathered in the streets as we passed, making merry, and that they\ngreeted Mr. Lowndes with respect and good cheer. His house, too, was\nset in a garden and quite as fine as Mr. Temple’s. It was ablaze with\ncandles, and I caught glimpses of fine gentlemen and ladies in the\nrooms. But he hurried me through the hall, and into a little chamber at\nthe rear where a writing-desk was set. He turned and faced me.\n\n“You must be tired, David,” he said.\n\nI nodded.\n\n“And hungry? Boys are always hungry.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“You had no dinner?”\n\n“No, sir,” I answered, off my guard.\n\n“Mercy!” he said. “It is a long time since breakfast.”\n\n“I had no breakfast, sir.”\n\n“Good God!” he said, and pulled the velvet handle of a cord. A negro\ncame.\n\n“Is the supper for the guests ready?”\n\n“Yes, Marsa.”\n\n“Then bring as much as you can carry here,” said the gentleman. “And ask\nMrs. Lowndes if I may speak with her.”\n\nMrs. Lowndes came first. And such a fine lady she was that she\nfrightened me, this being my first experience with ladies. But when Mr.\nLowndes told her my story, she ran to me impulsively and put her arms\nabout me.\n\n“Poor lad!” she said. “What a shame!”\n\nI think that the tears came then, but it was small wonder. There were\ntears in her eyes, too.\n\nSuch a supper as I had I shall never forget. And she sat beside me for\nlong, neglecting her guests, and talking of my life. Suddenly she turned\nto her husband, calling him by name.\n\n“He is Alec Ritchie’s son,” she said, “and Alec has gone against\nCameron.”\n\nMr. Lowndes did not answer, but nodded.\n\n“And must he go to Temple Bow?”\n\n“My dear,” said Mr. Lowndes, “I fear it is our duty to send him there.”\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. TEMPLE BOW\n\nIn the morning I started for Temple Bow on horseback behind one of Mr.\nLowndes’ negroes. Good Mrs. Lowndes had kissed me at parting, and\ntucked into my pocket a parcel of sweetmeats. There had been a few grave\ngentlemen to see me, and to their questions I had replied what I could.\nBut tell them of Mr. Temple I would not, save that he himself had told\nme nothing. And Mr. Lowndes had presently put an end to their talk.\n\n“The lad knows nothing, gentlemen,” he had said, which was true.\n\n“David,” said he, when he bade me farewell, “I see that your father has\nbrought you up to fear God. Remember that all you see in this life is\nnot to be imitated.”\n\nAnd so I went off behind his negro. He was a merry lad, and despite the\ngreat heat of the journey and my misgivings about Temple Bow, he made me\nlaugh. I was sad at crossing the ferry over the Ashley, through thinking\nof my father, but I reflected that it could not be long now ere I saw\nhim again. In the middle of the day we stopped at a tavern. And at\nlength, in the abundant shade of evening, we came to a pair of great\nornamental gates set between brick pillars capped with white balls, and\nturned into a drive. And presently, winding through the trees, we were\nin sight of a long, brick mansion trimmed with white, and a velvet\nlawn before it all flecked with shadows. In front of the portico was a\nsaddled horse, craning his long neck at two panting hounds stretched on\nthe ground. A negro boy in blue clutched the bridle. On the horse-block\na gentleman in white reclined. He wore shiny boots, and he held his hat\nin his hand, and he was gazing up at a lady who stood on the steps above\nhim.\n\nThe lady I remember as well--Lord forbid that I should forget her. And\nher laugh as I heard it that evening is ringing now in my ears. And yet\nit was not a laugh. Musical it was, yet there seemed no pleasure in it:\nrather irony, and a great weariness of the amusements of this world:\nand a note, too, from a vanity never ruffled. It stopped abruptly as the\nnegro pulled up his horse before her, and she stared at us haughtily.\n\n“What’s this?” she said.\n\n“Pardon, Mistis,” said the negro, “I’se got a letter from Marse\nLowndes.”\n\n“Mr. Lowndes should instruct his niggers,” she said. “There is a\nservants’ drive.” The man was turning his horse when she cried: “Hold!\nLet’s have it.”\n\nHe dismounted and gave her the letter, and I jumped to the ground,\nwatching her as she broke the seal, taking her in, as a boy will, from\nthe flowing skirt and tight-laced stays of her salmon silk to her\nhigh and powdered hair. She must have been about thirty. Her face was\nbeautiful, but had no particle of expression in it, and was dotted here\nand there with little black patches of plaster. While she was reading,\na sober gentleman in black silk breeches and severe coat came out of the\nhouse and stood beside her.\n\n“Heigho, parson,” said the gentleman on the horse-block, without moving,\n“are you to preach against loo or lansquenet to-morrow?”\n\n“Would it make any difference to you, Mr. Riddle?”\n\nBefore he could answer there came a great clatter behind them, and a boy\nof my own age appeared. With a leap he landed sprawling on the indolent\ngentleman’s shoulders, nearly upsetting him.\n\n“You young rascal!” exclaimed the gentleman, pitching him on the drive\nalmost at my feet; then he fell back again to a position where he could\nlook up at the lady.\n\n“Harry Riddle,” cried the boy, “I’ll ride steeplechases and beat you\nsome day.”\n\n“Hush, Nick,” cried the lady, petulantly, “I’ll have no nerves left me.”\n She turned to the letter again, holding it very near to her eyes,\nand made a wry face of impatience. Then she held the sheet out to Mr.\nRiddle.\n\n“A pretty piece of news,” she said languidly. “Read it, Harry.”\n\nThe gentleman seized her hand instead. The lady glanced at the\nclergyman, whose back was turned, and shook her head.\n\n“How tiresome you are!” she said.\n\n“What’s happened?” asked Mr. Riddle, letting go as the parson looked\naround.\n\n“Oh, they’ve had a battle,” said the lady, “and Moultrie and his Rebels\nhave beat off the King’s fleet.”\n\n“The devil they have!” exclaimed Mr. Riddle, while the parson started\nforwards. “Anything more?”\n\n“Yes, a little.” She hesitated. “That husband of mine has fled\nCharlestown. They think he went to the fleet.” And she shot a meaning\nlook at Mr. Riddle, who in turn flushed red. I was watching them.\n\n“What!” cried the clergyman, “John Temple has run away?”\n\n“Why not,” said Mr. Riddle. “One can’t live between wind and water long.\nAnd Charlestown’s--uncomfortable in summer.”\n\nAt that the clergyman cast one look at them--such a look as I shall\nnever forget--and went into the house.\n\n“Mamma,” said the boy, “where has father gone? Has he run away?”\n\n“Yes. Don’t bother me, Nick.”\n\n“I don’t believe it,” cried Nick, his high voice shaking. “I’d--I’d\ndisown him.”\n\nAt that Mr. Riddle burst into a hearty laugh.\n\n“Come, Nick,” said he, “it isn’t so bad as that. Your father’s for his\nMajesty, like the rest of us. He’s merely gone over to fight for him.”\n And he looked at the lady and laughed again. But I liked the boy.\n\nAs for the lady, she curled her lip. “Mr. Riddle, don’t be foolish,” she\nsaid. “If we are to play, send your horse to the stables.” Suddenly her\neye lighted on me. “One more brat,” she sighed. “Nick, take him to the\nnursery, or the stable. And both of you keep out of my sight.”\n\nNick strode up to me.\n\n“Don’t mind her. She’s always saying, ‘Keep out of my sight.’” His voice\ntrembled. He took me by the sleeve and began pulling me around the house\nand into a little summer bower that stood there; for he had a masterful\nmanner.\n\n“What’s your name?” he demanded.\n\n“David Trimble,” I said.\n\n“Have you seen my father in town?”\n\nThe intense earnestness of the question surprised an answer out of me.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Where?” he demanded.\n\n“In his house. My father left me with your father.”\n\n“Tell me about it.”\n\nI related as much as I dared, leaving out Mr. Temple’s double dealing;\nwhich, in truth, I did not understand. But the boy was relentless.\n\n“Why,” said he, “my father was a friend of Mr. Lowndes and Mr. Mathews.\nI have seen them here drinking with him. And in town. And he ran away?”\n\n“I do not know where he went,” said I, which was the truth.\n\nHe said nothing, but hid his face in his arms over the rail of the\nbower. At length he looked up at me fiercely.\n\n“If you ever tell this, I will kill you,” he cried. “Do you hear?”\n\nThat made me angry.\n\n“Yes, I hear,” I said. “But I am not afraid of you.”\n\nHe was at me in an instant, knocking me to the floor, so that the breath\nwent out of me, and was pounding me vigorously ere I recovered from the\nshock and astonishment of it and began to defend myself. He was taller\nthan I, and wiry, but not so rugged. Yet there was a look about him\nthat was far beyond his strength. A look that meant, never say die.\nCuriously, even as I fought desperately I compared him with that other\nlad I had known, Andy Jackson. And this one, though not so powerful,\nfrightened me the more in his relentlessness.\n\nPerhaps we should have been fighting still had not some one pulled us\napart, and when my vision cleared I saw Nick, struggling and kicking,\nheld tightly in the hands of the clergyman. And it was all that\ngentleman could do to hold him. I am sure it was quite five minutes\nbefore he forced the lad, exhausted, on to the seat. And then there\nwas a defiance about his nostrils that showed he was undefeated. The\nclergyman, still holding him with one hand, took out his handkerchief\nwith the other and wiped his brow.\n\nI expected a scolding and a sermon. To my amazement the clergyman said\nquietly:--\n\n“Now what was the trouble, David?”\n\n“I’ll not be the one to tell it, sir,” I said, and trembled at my\ntemerity.\n\nThe parson looked at me queerly.\n\n“Then you are in the right of it,” he said. “It is as I thought; I’ll\nnot expect Nicholas to tell me.”\n\n“I will tell you, sir,” said Nicholas. “He was in the house with my\nfather when--when he ran away. And I said that if he ever spoke of it to\nany one, I would kill him.”\n\nFor a while the clergyman was silent, gazing with a strange tenderness\nat the lad, whose face was averted.\n\n“And you, David?” he said presently.\n\n“I--I never mean to tell, sir. But I was not to be frightened.”\n\n“Quite right, my lad,” said the clergyman, so kindly that it sent a\nstrange thrill through me. Nicholas looked up quickly.\n\n“You won’t tell?” he said.\n\n“No,” I said.\n\n“You can let me go now, Mr. Mason,” said he. Mr. Mason did. And he came\nover and sat beside me, but said nothing more.\n\nAfter a while Mr. Mason cleared his throat.\n\n“Nicholas,” said he, “when you grow older you will understand these\nmatters better. Your father went away to join the side he believes in,\nthe side we all believe in--the King’s side.”\n\n“Did he ever pretend to like the other side?” asked Nick, quickly.\n\n“When you grow older you will know his motives,” answered the clergyman,\ngently. “Until then; you must trust him.”\n\n“You never pretended,” cried Nick.\n\n“Thank God I never was forced to do so,” said the clergyman, fervently.\n\nIt is wonderful that the conditions of our existence may wholly change\nwithout a seeming strangeness. After many years only vivid snatches of\nwhat I saw and heard and did at Temple Bow come back to me. I understood\nbut little the meaning of the seigniorial life there. My chief wonder\nnow is that its golden surface was not more troubled by the winds then\nbrewing. It was a new life to me, one that I had not dreamed of.\n\nAfter that first falling out, Nick and I became inseparable. Far slower\nthan he in my likes and dislikes, he soon became a passion with me.\nEven as a boy, he did everything with a grace unsurpassed; the dash and\ndaring of his pranks took one’s breath; his generosity to those he loved\nwas prodigal. Nor did he ever miss a chance to score those under his\ndispleasure. At times he was reckless beyond words to describe, and\nagain he would fall sober for a day. He could be cruel and tender in the\nsame hour; abandoned and freezing in his dignity. He had an old negro\nmammy whose worship for him and his possessions was idolatry. I can hear\nher now calling and calling, “Marse Nick, honey, yo’ supper’s done got\ncole,” as she searched patiently among the magnolias. And suddenly there\nwould be a shout, and Mammy’s turban go flying from her woolly head, or\nMammy herself would be dragged down from behind and sat upon.\n\nWe had our supper, Nick and I, at twilight, in the children’s dining\nroom. A little white room, unevenly panelled, the silver candlesticks\nand yellow flames fantastically reflected in the mirrors between the\ndeep windows, and the moths and June-bugs tilting at the lights. We sat\nat a little mahogany table eating porridge and cream from round blue\nbowls, with Mammy to wait on us. Sometimes there floated in upon us the\nhum of revelry from the great drawing-room where Madame had her company.\nOften the good Mr. Mason would come in to us (he cared little for the\nparties), and talk to us of our day’s doings. Nick had his lessons from\nthe clergyman in the winter time.\n\nMr. Mason took occasion once to question me on what I knew. Some of\nmy answers, in especial those relating to my knowledge of the Bible,\nsurprised him. Others made him sad.\n\n“David,” said he, “you are an earnest lad, with a head to learn, and you\nwill. When your father comes, I shall talk with him.” He paused--“I knew\nhim,” said he, “I knew him ere you were born. A just man, and upright,\nbut with a great sorrow. We must never be hasty in our judgments. But\nyou will never be hasty, David,” he added, smiling at me. “You are a\ngood companion for Nicholas.”\n\nNicholas and I slept in the same bedroom, at a corner of the long house,\nand far removed from his mother. She would not be disturbed by the\nnoise he made in the mornings. I remember that he had cut in the solid\nshutters of that room, folded into the embrasures, “Nicholas Temple, His\nMark,” and a long, flat sword. The first night in that room we slept but\nlittle, near the whole of it being occupied with tales of my adventures\nand of my life in the mountains. Over and over again I must tell him of\nthe “painters” and wildcats, of deer and bear and wolf. Nor was he ever\nsatisfied. And at length I came to speak of that land where I had often\nlived in fancy--the land beyond the mountains of which Daniel Boone had\ntold. Of its forest and glade, its countless herds of elk and buffalo,\nits salt-licks and Indians, until we fell asleep from sheer exhaustion.\n\n“I will go there,” he cried in the morning, as he hurried into his\nclothes; “I will go to that land as sure as my name is Nick Temple. And\nyou shall go with me, David.”\n\n“Perchance I shall go before you,” I answered, though I had small hopes\nof persuading my father.\n\nHe would often make his exit by the window, climbing down into the\ngarden by the protruding bricks at the corner of the house; or sometimes\ngo shouting down the long halls and through the gallery to the great\nstairway, a smothered oath from behind the closed bedroom doors\nproclaiming that he had waked a guest. And many days we spent in the\nwood, playing at hunting game--a poor enough amusement for me, and one\nthat Nick soon tired of. They were thick, wet woods, unlike our woods\nof the mountains; and more than once we had excitement enough with the\nsnakes that lay there.\n\nI believe that in a week’s time Nick was as conversant with my life as I\nmyself. For he made me tell of it again and again, and of Kentucky.\nAnd always as he listened his eyes would glow and his breast heave with\nexcitement.\n\n“Do you think your father will take you there, David, when he comes for\nyou?”\n\nI hoped so, but was doubtful.\n\n“I’ll run away with you,” he declared. “There is no one here who cares\nfor me save Mr. Mason and Mammy.”\n\nAnd I believe he meant it. He saw but little of his mother, and nearly\nalways something unpleasant was coupled with his views. Sometimes we\nran across her in the garden paths walking with a gallant,--oftenest Mr.\nRiddle. It was a beautiful garden, with hedge-bordered walks and flowers\nwondrously massed in color, a high brick wall surrounding it. Frequently\nMrs. Temple and Mr. Riddle would play at cards there of an afternoon,\nand when that musical, unbelieving laugh of hers came floating over the\nwall, Nick would say:--\n\n“Mamma is winning.”\n\nOnce we heard high words between the two, and running into the garden\nfound the cards scattered on the grass, and the couple gone.\n\nOf all Nick’s escapades,--and he was continually in and out of them,--I\nrecall only a few of the more serious. As I have said, he was a wild\nlad, sobered by none of the things which had gone to make my life, and\nwhat he took into his head to do he generally did,--or, if balked, flew\ninto such a rage as to make one believe he could not live. Life was\nalways war with him, or some semblance of a struggle. Of his many wild\ndoings I recall well the time when--fired by my tales of hunting--he\nwent out to attack the young bull in the paddock with a bow and arrow.\nIt made small difference to the bull that the arrow was too blunt to\nenter his hide. With a bellow that frightened the idle negroes at the\nslave quarters, he started for Master Nick. I, who had been taught by\nmy father never to run any unnecessary risk, had taken the precaution to\nprovide as large a stone as I could comfortably throw, and took station\non the fence. As the furious animal came charging, with his head\nlowered, I struck him by a good fortune between the eyes, and Nicholas\ngot over. We were standing on the far side, watching him pawing the\nbroken bow, when, in the crowd of frightened negroes, we discovered the\nparson beside us.\n\n“David,” said he, patting me with a shaking hand, “I perceive that you\nhave a cool head. Our young friend here has a hot one. Dr. Johnson may\nnot care for Scotch blood, and yet I think a wee bit of it is not to be\ndespised.”\n\nI wondered whether Dr. Johnson was staying in the house, too.\n\nHow many slaves there were at Temple Bow I know not, but we used to see\nthem coming home at night in droves, the overseers riding beside them\nwith whips and guns. One day a huge Congo chief, not long from Africa,\nnearly killed an overseer, and escaped to the swamp. As the day fell,\nwe heard the baying of the bloodhounds hot upon his trail. More ominous\nstill, a sound like a rising wind came from the direction of the\nquarters. Into our little dining-room burst Mrs. Temple herself,\nslamming the door behind her. Mr. Mason, who was sitting with us, rose\nto calm her.\n\n“The Rebels!” she cried. “The Rebels have taught them this, with their\naccursed notions of liberty and equality. We shall all be murdered by\nthe blacks because of the Rebels. Oh, hell-fire is too good for them.\nHave the house barred and a watch set to-night. What shall we do?”\n\n“I pray you compose yourself, Madame,” said the clergyman. “We can send\nfor the militia.”\n\n“The militia!” she shrieked; “the Rebel militia! They would murder us as\nsoon as the niggers.”\n\n“They are respectable men,” answered Mr. Mason, “and were at Fanning\nHall to-day patrolling.”\n\n“I would rather be killed by whites than blacks,” said the lady. “But\nwho is to go for the militia?”\n\n“I will ride for them,” said Mr. Mason. It was a dark, lowering night,\nand spitting rain.\n\n“And leave me defenceless!” she cried. “You do not stir, sir.”\n\n“It is a pity,” said Mr. Mason--he was goaded to it, I suppose--“‘tis a\npity Mr. Riddle did not come to-night.”\n\nShe shot at him a withering look, for even in her fear she would brook\nno liberties. Nick spoke up:--\n\n“I will go,” said he; “I can get through the woods to Fanning Hall--”\n\n“And I will go with him,” I said.\n\n“Let the brats go,” she said, and cut short Mr. Mason’s expostulations.\nShe drew Nick to her and kissed him. He wriggled away, and without more\nado we climbed out of the dining-room windows into the night. Running\nacross the lawn, we left the lights of the great house twinkling behind\nus in the rain. We had to pass the long line of cabins at the quarters.\nThree overseers with lanterns stood guard there; the cabins were dark,\nthe wretches within silent and cowed. Thence we felt with our feet\nfor the path across the fields, stumbled over a sty, and took our way\nthrough the black woods. I was at home here, and Nick was not to be\nfrightened. At intervals the mournful bay of a bloodhound came to us\nfrom a distance.\n\n“Suppose we should meet the Congo chief,” said Nick, suddenly.\n\nThe idea had occurred to me.\n\n“She needn’t have been so frightened,” said he, in scornful remembrance\nof his mother’s actions.\n\nWe pressed on. Nick knew the path as only a boy can. Half an hour\npassed. It grew brighter. The rain ceased, and a new moon shot out\nbetween the leaves. I seized his arm.\n\n“What’s that?” I whispered.\n\n“A deer.”\n\nBut I, cradled in woodcraft, had heard plainly a man creeping through\nthe underbrush beside us. Fear of the Congo chief and pity for the\nwretch tore at my heart. Suddenly there loomed in front of us, on the\npath, a great, naked man. We stood with useless limbs, staring at him.\n\nThen, from the trees over our heads, came a chittering and a chattering\nsuch as I had never heard. The big man before us dropped to the\nearth, his head bowed, muttering. As for me, my fright increased. The\nchattering stopped, and Nick stepped forward and laid his hand on the\nnegro’s bare shoulder.\n\n“We needn’t be afraid of him now, Davy,” he said. “I learned that trick\nfrom a Portuguese overseer we had last year.”\n\n“You did it!” I exclaimed, my astonishment overcoming my fear.\n\n“It’s the way the monkeys chatter in the Canaries,” he said. “Manuel had\na tame one, and I heard it talk. Once before I tried it on the chief,\nand he fell down. He thinks I’m a god.”\n\nIt must have been a weird scene to see the great negro following two\nboys in the moonlight. Indeed, he came after us like a dog. At length we\nwere in sight of the lights of Fanning Hall. The militia was there. We\nwere challenged by the guard, and caused sufficient amazement when we\nappeared in the hall before the master, who was a bachelor of fifty.\n\n“‘Sblood, Nick Temple!” he cried, “what are you doing here with that big\nCongo for a dog? The sight of him frightens me.”\n\nThe negro, indeed, was a sight to frighten one. The black mud of the\nswamps was caked on him, and his flesh was torn by brambles.\n\n“He ran away,” said Nick; “and I am taking him home.”\n\n“You--you are taking him home!” sputtered Mr. Fanning.\n\n“Do you want to see him act?” said Nick. And without waiting for a reply\nhe filled the hall with a dozen monkeys. Mr. Fanning leaped back into\na doorway, but the chief prostrated himself on the floor. “Now do you\nbelieve I can take him home?” said Nick.\n\n“‘Swounds!” said Mr. Fanning, when he had his breath. “You beat the\ndevil, Nicholas Temple. The next time you come to call I pray you leave\nyour travelling show at home.”\n\n“Mamma sent me for the militia,” said Nick.\n\n“She did!” said Mr. Fanning, looking grim. “An insurrection is a bad\nthing, but there was no danger for two lads in the woods, I suppose.”\n\n“There’s no danger anyway,” said Nick. “The niggers are all scared to\ndeath.”\n\nMr. Fanning burst out into a loud laugh, stopped suddenly, sat down, and\ntook Nick on his knee. It was an incongruous scene. Mr. Fanning almost\ncried.\n\n“Bless your soul,” he said, “but you are a lad. Would to God I had you\ninstead of--”\n\nHe paused abruptly.\n\n“I must go home,” said Nick; “she will be worried.”\n\n“She will be worried!” cried Mr. Fanning, in a burst of anger. Then he\nsaid: “You shall have the militia. You shall have the militia.” He rang\na bell and sent his steward for the captain, a gawky country farmer, who\ngave a gasp when he came upon the scene in the hall.\n\n“And mind,” said Nick to the captain, “you are to keep your men away\nfrom him, or he will kill one of them.”\n\nThe captain grinned at him curiously.\n\n“I reckon I won’t have to tell them to keep away,” said he.\n\nMr. Fanning started us off for the walk with pockets filled with\nsweetmeats, which we nibbled on the way back. We made a queer\nprocession, Nick and I striding ahead to show the path, followed by\nthe now servile chief, and after him the captain and his twenty men\nin single file. It was midnight when we saw the lights of Temple Bow\nthrough the trees. One of the tired overseers met us near the kitchen.\nWhen he perceived the Congo his face lighted up with rage, and he\ninstinctively reached for his whip. But the chief stood before him,\nimmovable, with arms folded, and a look on his face that meant danger.\n\n“He will kill you, Emory,” said Nick; “he will kill you if you touch\nhim.”\n\nEmory dropped his hand, limply.\n\n“He will go to work in the morning,” said Nick; “but mind you, not a\nlash.”\n\n“Very good, Master Nick,” said the man; “but who’s to get him in his\ncabin?”\n\n“I will,” said Nick. He beckoned to the Congo, who followed him over to\nquarters and went in at his door without a protest.\n\nThe next morning Mrs. Temple looked out of her window and saw the\nmilitiamen on the lawn.\n\n“Pooh!” she said, “are those butternuts the soldiers that Nick went to\nfetch?”\n\n\nCHAPTER V. CRAM’S HELL\n\nAfter that my admiration for Nick Temple increased greatly, whether\nexcited by his courage and presence of mind, or his ability to imitate\nmen and women and creatures, I know not. One of our amusements, I\nrecall, was to go to the Congo’s cabin to see him fall on his face,\nuntil Mr. Mason put a stop to it. The clergyman let us know that we were\nencouraging idolatry, and he himself took the chief in hand.\n\nAnother incident comes to me from those bygone days. The fear of negro\ninsurrections at the neighboring plantations being temporarily lulled,\nthe gentry began to pluck up courage for their usual amusements. There\nwere to be races at some place a distance away, and Nick was determined\nto go. Had he not determined that I should go, all would have been well.\nThe evening before he came upon his mother in the garden. Strange to\nsay, she was in a gracious mood and alone.\n\n“Come and kiss me, Nick,” she said. “Now, what do you want?”\n\n“I want to go to the races,” he said.\n\n“You have your pony. You can follow the coach.”\n\n“David is to ride the pony,” said Nick, generously. “May I go in the\ncoach?”\n\n“No,” she said, “there is no room for you.”\n\nNicholas flared up. “Harry Riddle is going in the coach. I don’t see why\nyou can’t take me sometimes. You like him better than me.”\n\nThe lady flushed very red.\n\n“How dare you, Nick!” she cried angrily. “What has Mr. Mason been\nputting into your head?”\n\n“Nothing,” said Nick, quite as angrily. “Any one can see that you like\nHarry. And I will ride in the coach.”\n\n“You’ll not,” said his mother.\n\nI had heard nothing of this. The next morning he led out his pony from\nthe stables for me to ride, and insisted. And, supposing he was to go\nin the coach, I put foot in the stirrup. The little beast would scarce\nstand still for me to mount.\n\n“You’ll not need the whip with her,” said Nick, and led her around by\nthe side of the house, in view of the portico, and stood there at her\nbridle. Presently, with a great noise and clatter of hoofs, the coach\nrounded the drive, the powdered negro coachman pulling up the four\nhorses with much ceremony at the door. It was a wondrous great vehicle,\nthe bright colors of its body flashing in the morning light. I had\nexamined it more than once, and with awe, in the coach-house. It had\nglass windows and a lion on a blue shield on the door, and within it was\nall salmon silk, save the painted design on the ceiling. Great leather\nstraps held up this house on wheels, to take the jolts of the road. And\nbehind it was a platform. That morning two young negroes with flowing\nblue coats stood on it. They leaped to the ground when the coach\nstopped, and stood each side of the door, waiting for my lady to enter.\n\nShe came down the steps, laughing, with Mr. Riddle, who was in his\nriding clothes, for he was to race that day. He handed her in, and got\nin after her. The coachman cracked his whip, the coach creaked off\ndown the drive, I in the trees one side waiting for them to pass, and\nwondering what Nick was to do. He had let go my bridle, folded his whip\nin his hand, and with a shout of “Come on, Davy,” he ran for the coach,\nwhich was going slowly, caught hold of the footman’s platform, and\npulled himself up.\n\nWhat possessed the footman I know not. Perchance fear of his mistress\nwas greater than fear of his young master; but he took the lad by the\nshoulders--gently, to be sure--and pushed him into the road, where he\nfell and rolled over. I guessed what would happen. Picking himself up,\nNick was at the man like a hurricane, seizing him swiftly by the leg.\nThe negro fell upon the platform, clutching wildly, where he lay in a\nsheer fright, shrieking for mercy, his cries rivalled by those of the\nlady within. The coachman frantically pulled his horses to a stand, the\nother footman jumped off, and Mr. Harry Riddle came flying out of the\ncoach door, to behold Nicholas beating the negro with his riding-whip.\n\n“You young devil,” cried Mr. Riddle, angrily, striding forward, “what\nare you doing?”\n\n“Keep off, Harry,” said Nicholas. “I am teaching this nigger that he\nis not to lay hands on his betters.” With that he gave the boy one more\ncut, and turned from him contemptuously.\n\n“What is it, Harry?” came in a shrill voice from within the coach.\n\n“It’s Nick’s pranks,” said Mr. Riddle, grinning in spite of his anger;\n“he’s ruined one of your footmen. You little scoundrel,” cried Mr.\nRiddle, advancing again, “you’ve frightened your mother nearly to a\nswoon.”\n\n“Serves her right,” said Nick.\n\n“What!” cried Mr. Riddle. “Come down from there instantly.”\n\nNick raised his whip. It was not that that stopped Mr. Riddle, but a\nsign about the lad’s nostrils.\n\n“Harry Riddle,” said the boy, “if it weren’t for you, I’d be riding in\nthis coach to-day with my mother. I don’t want to ride with her, but\nI will go to the races. If you try to take me down, I’ll do my best to\nkill you,” and he lifted the loaded end of the whip.\n\nMrs. Temple’s beautiful face had by this time been thrust out of the\ndoor.\n\n“For the love of heaven, Harry, let him come in with us. We’re late\nenough as it is.”\n\nMr. Riddle turned on his heel. He tried to glare at Nick, but he broke\ninto a laugh instead.\n\n“Come down, Satan,” says he. “God help the woman you love and the man\nyou fight.”\n\nAnd so Nicholas jumped down, and into the coach. The footman picked\nhimself up, more scared than injured, and the vehicle took its lumbering\nway for the race-course, I following.\n\nI have seen many courses since, but none to equal that in the gorgeous\ndress of those who watched. There had been many, many more in former\nyears, so I heard people say. This was the only sign that a war was\nin progress,--the scanty number of gentry present,--for all save the\nindifferent were gone to Charlestown or elsewhere. I recall it dimly,\nas a blaze of color passing: merrymaking, jesting, feasting,--a rare\ncontrast, I thought, to the sight I had beheld in Charlestown Bay but\na while before. Yet so runs the world,--strife at one man’s home, and\npeace and contentment at his neighbor’s; sorrow here, and rejoicing not\na league away.\n\nMaster Nicholas played one prank that evening that was near to costing\ndear. My lady Temple made up a party for Temple Bow at the course, two\nother coaches to come and some gentlemen riding. As Nick and I were\nrunning through the paddock we came suddenly upon Mr. Harry Riddle and\na stout, swarthy gentleman standing together. The stout gentleman was\ncounting out big gold pieces in his hand and giving them to Mr. Riddle.\n\n“Lucky dog!” said the stout gentleman; “you’ll ride back with her, and\nyou’ve won all I’ve got.” And he dug Mr. Riddle in the ribs.\n\n“You’ll have it again when we play to-night, Darnley,” answered Mr.\nRiddle, crossly. “And as for the seat in the coach, you are welcome to\nit. That firebrand of a lad is on the front seat.”\n\n“D--n the lad,” said the stout gentleman. “I’ll take it, and you can\nride my horse. He’ll--he’ll carry you, I reckon.” His voice had a way of\ncracking into a mellow laugh.\n\nAt that Mr. Riddle went off in a towering bad humor, and afterwards I\nheard him cursing the stout gentleman’s black groom as he mounted his\ngreat horse. And then he cursed the horse as it reared and plunged,\nwhile the stout gentleman stood at the coach door, cackling at his\ndiscomfiture. The gentleman did ride home with Mrs. Temple, Nick going\ninto another coach. I afterwards discovered that the gentleman had\nbribed him with a guinea. And Mr. Riddle more than once came near\nrunning down my pony on his big charger, and he swore at me roundly,\ntoo.\n\nThat night there was a gay supper party in the big dining room at Temple\nBow. Nick and I looked on from the gallery window. It was a pretty\nsight. The long mahogany board reflecting the yellow flames of the\ncandles, and spread with bright silver and shining dishes loaded with\ndainties, the gentlemen and ladies in brilliant dress, the hurrying\nservants,--all were of a new and strange world to me. And presently,\nafter the ladies were gone, the gentlemen tossed off their wine and\nroared over their jokes, and followed into the drawing-room. This I\nnoticed, that only Mr. Harry Riddle sat silent and morose, and that he\nhad drunk more than the others.\n\n“Come, Davy,” said Nick to me, “let’s go and watch them again.”\n\n“But how?” I asked, for the drawing-room windows were up some distance\nfrom the ground, and there was no gallery on that side.\n\n“I’ll show you,” said he, running into the garden. After searching\nawhile in the dark, he found a ladder the gardener had left against a\ntree; after much straining, we carried the ladder to the house and\nset it up under one of the windows of the drawing-room. Then we both\nclambered cautiously to the top and looked in.\n\nThe company were at cards, silent, save for a low remark now and again.\nThe little tables were ranged along by the windows, and it chanced that\nMr. Harry Riddle sat so close to us that we could touch him. On his\nright sat Mr. Darnley, the stout gentleman, and in the other seats two\nladies. Between Mr. Riddle and Mr. Darnley was a pile of silver and gold\npieces. There was not room for two of us in comfort at the top of the\nladder, so I gave place to Nick, and sat on a lower rung. Presently I\nsaw him raise himself, reach in, and duck quickly.\n\n“Feel that,” he whispered to me, chuckling and holding out his hand.\n\nIt was full of money.\n\n“But that’s stealing, Nick,” I said, frightened.\n\n“Of course I’ll give it back,” he whispered indignantly.\n\nInstantly there came loud words and the scraping of chairs within the\nroom, and a woman’s scream. I heard Mr. Riddle’s voice say thickly, amid\nthe silence that followed:--\n\n“Mr. Darnley, you’re a d--d thief, sir.”\n\n“You shall answer for this, when you are sober, sir,” said Mr. Darnley.\n\nThen there came more scraping of chairs, all the company talking\nexcitedly at once. Nick and I scrambled to the ground, and we did the\nvery worst thing we could possibly have done,--we took the ladder away.\n\nThere was little sleep for me that night. I had first of all besought\nNick to go up into the drawing-room and give the money back. But some\nstrange obstinacy in him resisted.\n\n“‘Twill serve Harry well for what he did to-day,” said he.\n\nMy next thought was to find Mr. Mason, but he was gone up the river to\nvisit a sick parishioner. I had seen enough of the world to know that\ngentlemen fought for less than what had occurred in the drawing-room\nthat evening. And though I had neither love nor admiration for Mr.\nRiddle, and though the stout gentleman was no friend of mine, I cared\nnot to see either of them killed for a prank. But Nick would not listen\nto me, and went to sleep in the midst of my urgings.\n\n“Davy,” said he, pinching me, “do you know what you are?”\n\n“No,” said I.\n\n“You’re a granny,” he said. And that was the last word I could get out\nof him. But I lay awake a long time, thinking. Breed had whiled away\nfor me one hot morning in Charlestown with an account of the gentry and\ntheir doings, many of which he related in an awed whisper that I could\nnot understand. They were wild doings indeed to me. But strangest of all\nseemed the duels, conducted with a decorum and ceremony as rigorous as\nthe law.\n\n“Did you ever see a duel, Breed?” I had asked.\n\n“Yessah,” said Breed, dramatically, rolling the whites of his eyes.\n\n“Where?”\n\n“Whah? Down on de riveh bank at Temple Bow in de ea’ly mo’nin’! Dey mos’\ncommonly fights at de dawn.”\n\nBreed had also told me where he was in hiding at the time, and that was\nwhat troubled me. Try as I would, I could not remember. It had sounded\nlike Clam Shell. That I recalled, and how Breed had looked out at the\nsword-play through the cracks of the closed shutters, agonized between\nfear of ghosts within and the drama without. At the first faint light\nthat came into our window I awakened Nick.\n\n“Listen,” I said; “do you know a place called Clam Shell?”\n\nHe turned over, but I punched him persistently until he sat up.\n\n“What the deuce ails you, Davy?” he asked, rubbing his eyes. “Have you\nnightmare?”\n\n“Do you know a place called Clam Shell, down on the river bank, Nick?”\n\n“Why,” he replied, “you must be thinking of Cram’s Hell.”\n\n“What’s that?” I asked.\n\n“It’s a house that used to belong to Cram, who was an overseer. The\nniggers hated him, and he was killed in bed by a big black nigger\nchief from Africa. The niggers won’t go near the place. They say it’s\nhaunted.”\n\n“Get up,” said I; “we’re going there now.”\n\nNick sprang out of bed and began to get into his clothes.\n\n“Is it a game?” he asked.\n\n“Yes.” He was always ready for a game.\n\nWe climbed out of the window, and made our way in the mist through the\nlong, wet grass, Nick leading. He took a path through a dark forest\nswamp, over logs that spanned the stagnant waters, and at length,\njust as the mist was growing pearly in the light, we came out at a\ntumble-down house that stood in an open glade by the river’s bank.\n\n“What’s to do now?” said Nick.\n\n“We must get into the house,” I answered. But I confess I didn’t care\nfor the looks of it.\n\nNick stared at me.\n\n“Very good, Davy,” he said; “I’ll follow where you go.”\n\nIt was a Saturday morning. Why I recall this I do not know. It has no\nspecial significance.\n\nI tried the door. With a groan and a shriek it gave way, disclosing the\nblackness inside. We started back involuntarily. I looked at Nick, and\nNick at me. He was very pale, and so must I have been. But such was the\nrespect we each held for the other’s courage that neither dared flinch.\nAnd so I walked in, although it seemed as if my shirt was made of needle\npoints and my hair stood on end. The crackings of the old floor were to\nme like the shots in Charlestown Bay. Our hearts beating wildly, we made\nour way into a farther room. It was like walking into the beyond.\n\n“Is there a window here?” I asked Nick, my voice sounding like a shout.\n\n“Yes, ahead of us.”\n\nGroping for it, I suddenly received a shock that set me reeling. Human\nnature could stand no more. We both turned tail and ran out of the house\nas fast as we could, and stood in the wet grass, panting. Then shame\ncame.\n\n“Let’s open the window first,” I suggested. So we walked around the\nhouse and pried the solid shutter from its fastenings. Then, gathering\nour courage, we went in again at the door. In the dim light let into\nthe farther room we saw a four-poster bed, old and cheap, with ragged\ncurtains. It was this that I had struck in my groping.\n\n“The chief killed Cram there,” said Nick, in an awed voice, “in that\nbed. What do you want to do here, Davy?”\n\n“Wait,” I said, though I had as little mind to wait as ever in my life.\n“Stand here by the window.”\n\nWe waited there. The mist rose. The sun peeped over the bank of dense\ngreen forest and spread rainbow colors on the still waters of the river.\nNow and again a fish broke, or a great bird swooped down and slit the\nsurface. A far-off snatch of melody came to our ears,--the slaves were\ngoing to work. Nothing more. And little by little grave misgivings\ngnawed at my soul of the wisdom of coming to this place. Doubtless there\nwere many other spots.\n\n“Davy,” said Nick, at last, “I’m sorry I took that money. What are we\nhere for?”\n\n“Hush!” I whispered; “do you hear anything?”\n\nI did, and distinctly. For I had been brought up in the forest.\n\n“I hear voices,” he said presently, “coming this way.”\n\nThey were very clear to me by then. Emerging from the forest path\nwere five gentlemen. The leader, more plainly dressed than the others,\ncarried a leather case. Behind him was the stout figure of Mr. Darnley,\nhis face solemn; and last of all came Mr. Harry Riddle, very pale, but\ncutting the tops of the long grass with a switch. Nick seized my arm.\n\n“They are going to fight,” said he.\n\n“Yes,” I replied, “and we are here to stop them, now.”\n\n“No, not now,” he said, holding me still. “We’ll have some more fun out\nof this yet.”\n\n“Fun?” I echoed.\n\n“Yes,” he said excitedly. “Leave it to me. I shan’t let them fight.”\n\nAnd that instant we changed generals, David giving place to Nicholas.\n\nMr. Riddle retired with one gentleman to a side of the little patch of\ngrass, and Mr. Darnley and a friend to another. The fifth gentleman took\na position halfway between the two, and, opening the leather case, laid\nit down on the grass, where its contents glistened.\n\n“That’s Dr. Ball,” whispered Nick. And his voice shook with excitement.\n\nMr. Riddle stripped off his coat and waistcoat and ruffles, and his\nsword-belt, and Mr. Darnley did the same. Both gentlemen drew their\nswords and advanced to the middle of the lawn, and stood opposite one\nanother, with flowing linen shirts open at the throat, and bared heads.\nThey were indeed a contrast. Mr. Riddle, tall and white, with closed\nlips, glared at his opponent. Mr. Darnley cut a merrier figure,--rotund\nand flushed, with fat calves and short arms, though his countenance was\nsober enough. All at once the two were circling their swords in the air,\nand then Nick had flung open the shutter and leaped through the window,\nand was running and shouting towards the astonished gentlemen, all of\nwhom wheeled to face him. He jingled as he ran.\n\n“What in the devil’s name now?” cried Mr. Riddle, angrily. “Here’s this\nimp again.”\n\nNicholas stopped in front of him, and, thrusting his hand in his\nbreeches pocket, fished out a handful of gold and silver, which he held\nout to the confounded Mr. Riddle.\n\n“Harry,” said he, “here’s something of yours I found last night.”\n\n“You found?” echoed Mr. Riddle, in a strange voice, amidst a dead\nsilence. “You found where?”\n\n“On the table beside you.”\n\n“And where the deuce were you?” Mr. Riddle demanded.\n\n“In the window behind you,” said Nick, calmly.\n\nThis piece of information, to Mr. Riddle’s plain discomfiture, was\ngreeted with a roar of laughter, Mr. Darnley himself laughing loudest.\nNor were these gentlemen satisfied with that. They crowded around Mr.\nRiddle and slapped him on the back, Mr. Darnley joining in with the\nrest. And presently Mr. Riddle flung away his sword, and laughed, too,\ngiving his hand to Mr. Darnley.\n\nAt length Mr. Darnley turned to Nick, who had stood all this while\nbehind them, unmoved.\n\n“My friend,” said he, seriously, “such is your regard for human life,\nyou will probably one day be a pirate or an outlaw. This time we’ve\nhad a laugh. The next time somebody will be weeping. I wish I were your\nfather.”\n\n“I wish you were,” said Nick.\n\nThis took Mr. Darnley’s breath. He glanced at the other gentlemen, who\nreturned his look significantly. He laid his hand kindly on the lad’s\nhead.\n\n“Nick,” said he, “I wish to God I were your father.”\n\nAfter that they all went home, very merry, to breakfast, Nick and I\ncoming after them. Nick was silent until we reached the house.\n\n“Davy,” said he, then, “how old are you?”\n\n“Ten,” I answered. “How old did you believe me?”\n\n“Eighty,” said he.\n\nThe next day, being Sunday, we all gathered in the little church to hear\nMr. Mason preach. Nick and I sat in the high box pew of the family with\nMrs. Temple, who paid not the least attention to the sermon. As for me,\nthe rhythm of it held me in fascination. Mr. Mason had written it out\nand that afternoon read over this part of it to Nick. The quotation I\nrecall, having since read it many times, and the gist of it was in this\nwise:--\n\n“And he said unto him, ‘What thou wilt have thou wilt have, despite\nthe sin of it. Blessed are the stolid, and thrice cursed he who hath\nimagination,--for that imagination shall devour him. And in thy life a\nsin shall be presented unto thee with a great longing. God, who is in\nheaven, gird thee for that struggle, my son, for it will surely come.\nThat it may be said of you, ‘Behold, I have refined thee, but not with\nsilver, I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.’ Seven days\nshalt thou wrestle with thy soul; seven nights shall evil haunt thee,\nand how thou shalt come forth from that struggle no man may know.’”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. MAN PROPOSES, BUT GOD DISPOSES\n\nA week passed, and another Sunday came,--a Sunday so still and hot and\nmoist that steam seemed to rise from the heavy trees,--an idle day for\nmaster and servant alike. A hush was in the air, and a presage of we\nknew not what. It weighed upon my spirits, and even Nick’s, and we\nwandered restlessly under the trees, seeking for distraction.\n\nAbout two o’clock a black line came on the horizon, and slowly crept\nhigher until it broke into giant, fantastic shapes. Mutterings arose,\nbut the sun shone hot as ever.\n\n“We’re to have a hurricane,” said Nick. “I wish we might have it and be\ndone with it.”\n\nAt five the sun went under. I remember that Madame was lolling listless\nin the garden, daintily arrayed in fine linen, trying to talk to Mr.\nMason, when a sound startled us. It was the sound of swift hoof beats on\nthe soft drive.\n\nMrs. Temple got up, an unusual thing. Perchance she was expecting a\nmessage from some of the gentlemen; or else she may well have been\ntired of Mr. Mason. Nick and I were before her, and, running through the\nhouse, arrived at the portico in time to see a negro ride up on a horse\ncovered with lather.\n\nIt was the same negro who had fetched me hither from Mr. Lowndes. And\nwhen I saw him my heart stood still lest he had brought news of my\nfather.\n\n“What’s to do, boy?” cried Nicholas to him.\n\nThe boy held in his hand a letter with a great red seal.\n\n“Fo’ Mistis Temple,” he said, and, looking at me queerly, he took off\nhis cap as he jumped from the horse. Mistress Temple herself having\narrived, he handed her the letter. She took it, and broke the seal\ncarelessly.\n\n“Oh,” she said, “it’s only from Mr. Lowndes. I wonder what he wishes\nnow.”\n\nEvery moment of her reading was for me an agony, and she read slowly.\nThe last words she spoke aloud:--\n\n“‘If you do not wish the lad, send him to me, as Kate is very fond of\nhim.’ So Kate is very fond of him,” she repeated. And handing the letter\nto Mr. Mason, she added, “Tell him, Parson.”\n\nThe words burned into my soul and seared it. And to this day I tremble\nwith anger as I think of them. The scene comes before me: the sky, the\ndarkened portico, and Nicholas running after his mother crying: “Oh,\nmamma, how could you! How could you!”\n\nMr. Mason bent over me in compassion, and smoothed my hair.\n\n“David,” said he, in a thick voice, “you are a brave boy, David. You\nwill need all your courage now, my son. May God keep your nature sweet!”\n\nHe led me gently into the arbor and told me how, under Captain Baskin,\nthe detachment had been ambushed by the Cherokees; and how my father,\nwith Ensign Calhoun and another, had been killed, fighting bravely.\nThe rest of the company had cut their way through and reached the\nsettlements after terrible hardships.\n\nI was left an orphan.\n\nI shall not dwell here on the bitterness of those moments. We have all\nknown sorrows in our lives,--great sorrows. The clergyman was a wise\nman, and did not strive to comfort me with words. But he sat there\nunder the leaves with his arm about me until a blinding bolt split the\nblackness of the sky and the thunder rent our ears, and a Caribbean\nstorm broke over Temple Bow with all the fury of the tropics. Then he\nled me through the drenching rain into the house, nor heeded the wet\nhimself on his Sunday coat.\n\nA great anger stayed me in my sorrow. I would no longer tarry under Mrs.\nTemple’s roof, though the world without were a sea or a desert. The\none resolution to escape rose stronger and stronger within me, and I\ndetermined neither to eat nor sleep until I had got away. The thought\nof leaving Nick was heavy indeed; and when he ran to me in the dark hall\nand threw his arms around me, it needed all my strength to keep from\ncrying aloud.\n\n“Davy,” he said passionately, “Davy, you mustn’t mind what she says.\nShe never means anything she says--she never cares for anything save her\npleasure. You and I will stay here until we are old enough to run away\nto Kentucky. Davy! Answer me, Davy!”\n\nI could not, try as I would. There were no words that would come with\nhonesty. But I pulled him down on the mahogany settle near the door\nwhich led into the back gallery, and there we sat huddled together in\nsilence, while the storm raged furiously outside and the draughts banged\nthe great doors of the house. In the lightning flashes I saw Nick’s\nface, and it haunted me afterwards through many years of wandering. On\nit was written a sorrow for me greater than my own sorrow. For God had\ngiven to this lad every human passion and compassion.\n\nThe storm rolled away with the night, and Mammy came through the hall\nwith a candle.\n\n“Whah is you, Marse Nick? Whah is you, honey? You’ suppah’s ready.”\n\nAnd so we went into our little dining room, but I would not eat. The\ngood old negress brushed her eyes with her apron as she pressed a\ncake upon me she had made herself, for she had grown fond of me. And\npresently we went away silently to bed.\n\nIt was a long, long time before Nick’s breathing told me that he was\nasleep. He held me tightly clutched to him, and I know that he feared I\nwould leave him. The thought of going broke my heart, but I never once\nwavered in my resolve, and I lay staring into the darkness, pondering\nwhat to do. I thought of good Mr. Lowndes and his wife, and I decided\nto go to Charlestown. Some of my boyish motives come back to me now:\nI should be near Nick; and even at that age,--having lived a life of\nself-reliance,--I thought of gaining an education and of rising to a\nplace of trust. Yes, I would go to Mr. Lowndes, and ask him to let me\nwork for him and so earn my education.\n\nWith a heavy spirit I crept out of bed, slowly disengaging Nick’s arm\nlest he should wake. He turned over and sighed in his sleep. Carefully\nI dressed myself, and after I was dressed I could not refrain from\nslipping to the bedside to bend over him once again,--for he was the\nonly one in my life with whom I had found true companionship. Then I\nclimbed carefully out of the window, and so down the corner of the house\nto the ground.\n\nIt was starlight, and a waning moon hung in the sky. I made my way\nthrough the drive between the black shadows of the forest, and came at\nlength to the big gates at the entrance, locked for the night. A strange\nthought of their futility struck me as I climbed the rail fence beside\nthem, and pushed on into the main road, the mud sucking under my shoes\nas I went. As I try now to cast my memory back I can recall no fear,\nonly a vast sense of loneliness, and the very song of it seemed to be\nsung in never ending refrain by the insects of the night. I had been\nalone in the mountains before. I have crossed great strips of wilderness\nsince, but always there was love to go back to. Then I was leaving the\nonly being in the world that remained to me.\n\nI must have walked two hours or more before I came to the mire of a\ncross-road, and there I stood in a quandary of doubt as to which side\nled to Charlestown.\n\nAs I lingered a light began to tremble in the heavens. A cock crew in\nthe distance. I sat down on a fallen log to rest. But presently, as the\nlight grew, I heard shouts which drew nearer and deeper and brought me\nto my feet in an uncertainty of expectation. Next came the rattling of\nchains, the scramble of hoofs in the mire, and here was a wagon with\na big canvas cover. Beside the straining horses was a great, burly man\nwith a red beard, cracking his long whip, and calling to the horses in a\nstrange tongue. He stopped still beside his panting animals when he saw\nme, his high boots sunk in the mud.\n\n“Gut morning, poy,” he said, wiping his red face with his sleeve; “what\nyou do here?”\n\n“I am going to Charlestown,” I answered.\n\n“Ach!” he cried, “dot is pad. Mein poy, he run avay. You are ein gut\npoy, I know. I vill pay ein gut price to help me vit mein wagon--ja.”\n\n“Where are you going?” I demanded, with a sudden wavering.\n\n“Up country--pack country. You know der Proad River--yes?”\n\nNo, I did not. But a longing came upon me for the old backwoods life,\nwith its freedom and self-reliance, and a hatred for this steaming\ncountry of heat and violent storms, and artificiality and pomp. And I\nhad a desire, even at that age, to make my own way in the world.\n\n“What will you give me?” I asked.\n\nAt that he put his finger to his nose.\n\n“Thruppence py the day.”\n\nI shook my head. He looked at me queerly.\n\n“How old you pe,--twelve, yes?”\n\nNow I had no notion of telling him. So I said: “Is this the Charlestown\nroad?”\n\n“Fourpence!” he cried, “dot is riches.”\n\n“I will go for sixpence,” I answered.\n\n“Mein Gott!” he cried, “sixpence. Dot is robbery.” But seeing me\nobdurate, he added: “I vill give it, because ein poy I must have. Vat is\nyour name,--Tavid? You are ein sharp poy, Tavid.”\n\nAnd so I went with him.\n\nIn writing a biography, the relative value of days and years should\nhold. There are days which count in space for years, and years for days.\nI spent the time on the whole happily with this Dutchman, whose name\nwas Hans Köppel. He talked merrily save when he spoke of the war against\nEngland, and then contemptuously, for he was a bitter English partisan.\nAnd in contrast to this he would dwell for hours on a king he called\nFriedrich der Grosse, and a war he waged that was a war; and how this\nmighty king had fought a mighty queen at Rossbach and Leuthen in his own\ncountry,--battles that were battles.\n\n“And you were there, Hans?” I asked him once.\n\n“Ja,” he said, “but I did not stay.”\n\n“You ran away?”\n\n“Ja,” Hans would answer, laughing, “run avay. I love peace, Tavid. Dot\nis vy I come here, and now,” bitterly, “and now ve haf var again once.”\n\nI would say nothing; but I must have looked my disapproval, for he went\non to explain that in Saxe-Gotha, where he was born, men were made to\nfight whether they would or no; and they were stolen from their wives at\nnight by soldiers of the great king, or lured away by fair promises.\n\nTravelling with incredible slowness, in due time we came to a county\ncalled Orangeburg, where all were Dutchmen like Hans, and very few spoke\nEnglish. And they all thought like Hans, and loved peace, and hated\nthe Congress. On Sundays, as we lay over at the taverns, these would\nbe filled with a rollicking crowd of fiddlers and dancers, quaintly\ndressed, the women bringing their children and babies. At such times\nHans would be drunk, and I would have to feed the tired horses and mount\nwatch over the cargo. I had many adventures, but none worth the telling\nhere. And at length we came to Hans’s farm, in a prettily rolling\ncountry on the Broad River. Hans’s wife spoke no English at all, nor\ndid the brood of children running about the house. I had small fancy\nfor staying in such a place, and so Hans paid me two crowns for my three\nweeks’ service; I think, with real regret, for labor was scarce in those\nparts, and though I was young, I knew how to work. And I could at least\nhave guided his plough in the furrow and cared for his cattle.\n\nIt was the first money I had earned in my life, and a prouder day than\nmany I have had since.\n\nFor the convenience of travellers passing that way, Hans kept a\ntavern,--if it could have been dignified by such a name. It was in truth\nmerely a log house with shakedowns, and stood across the rude road from\nhis log farmhouse. And he gave me leave to sleep there and to work for\nmy board until I cared to leave. It so chanced that on the second day\nafter my arrival a pack-train came along, guided by a nettlesome old man\nand a strong, black-haired lass of sixteen or thereabouts. The old man,\nwhose name was Ripley, wore a nut-brown hunting shirt trimmed with red\ncotton; and he had no sooner slipped the packs from his horses than he\nbegan to rail at Hans, who stood looking on.\n\n“You damned Dutchmen be all Tories, and worse,” he cried; “you stay here\nand till your farms while our boys are off in the hill towns fighting\nCherokees. I wish the devils had every one of your fat sculps. Polly\nAnn, water the nags.”\n\nHans replied to this sally with great vigor, lapsing into Dutch. Polly\nAnn led the scrawny ponies to the trough, but her eyes snapped with\nmerriment as she listened. She was a wonderfully comely lass, despite\nher loose cotton gown and poke-bonnet and the shoepacks on her feet.\nShe had blue eyes, the whitest, strongest of teeth, and the rosiest of\nfaces.\n\n“Gran’pa hates a Dutchman wuss’n pizen,” she said to me. “So do I. We’ve\nall been burned out and sculped up river--and they never give us so much\nas a man or a measure of corn.”\n\nI helped her feed the animals, and tether them, and loose their bells\nfor the night, and carry the packs under cover.\n\n“All the boys is gone to join Rutherford and lam the Indians,” she\ncontinued, “so Gran’pa and I had to go to the settlements. There wahn’t\nany one else. What’s your name?” she demanded suddenly.\n\nI told her.\n\nShe sat down on a log at the corner of the house, and pulled me down\nbeside her.\n\n“And whar be you from?”\n\nI told her. It was impossible to look into her face and not tell her.\nShe listened eagerly, now with compassion, and now showing her white\nteeth in amusement. And when I had done, much to my discomfiture, she\nseized me in her strong arms and kissed me.\n\n“Poor Davy,” she cried, “you ain’t got a home. You shall come home with\nus.”\n\nCatching me by the hand, she ran like a deer across the road to where\nher grandfather was still quarrelling violently with Hans, and pulled\nhim backward by the skirts of his hunting shirt. I looked for another\nand mightier explosion from the old backwoodsman, but to my astonishment\nhe seemed to forget Hans’s existence, and turned and smiled on her\nbenevolently.\n\n“Polly Ann,” said he, “what be you about now?”\n\n“Gran’pa,” said she, “here’s Davy Trimble, who’s a good boy, and his pa\nis just killed by the Cherokees along with Baskin, and he wants work and\na home, and he’s comin’ along with us.”\n\n“All right, David,” answered Mr. Ripley, mildly, “ef Polly Ann says so,\nyou kin come. Whar was you raised?”\n\nI told him on the upper Yadkin.\n\n“You don’t tell me,” said he. “Did ye ever know Dan’l Boone?”\n\n“I did, indeed, sir,” I answered, my face lighting up. “Can you tell me\nwhere he is now?”\n\n“He’s gone to Kaintuckee, them new settlements, fer good. And ef I\nwasn’t eighty years old, I’d go thar, too.”\n\n“I reckon I’ll go thar when I’m married,” said Polly Ann, and blushed\nredder than ever. Drawing me to her, she said, “I’ll take you, too,\nDavy.”\n\n“When you marry that wuthless Tom McChesney,” said her grandfather,\ntestily.\n\n“He’s not wuthless,” said Polly, hotly. “He’s the best man in\nRutherford’s army. He’ll git more sculps then any of ‘em,--you see.”\n\n“Tavy is ein gut poy,” Hans put in, for he had recovered his composure.\n“I wish much he stay mit me.”\n\nAs for me, Polly Ann never consulted me on the subject--nor had she need\nto. I would have followed her to kingdom come, and at the thought of\nreaching the mountains my heart leaped with joy. We all slept in the one\nflea-infested, windowless room of the “tavern” that night; and before\ndawn I was up and untethered the horses, and Polly Ann and I together\nlifted the two bushels of alum salt on one of the beasts and the\nploughshare on the other. By daylight we had left Hans and his farm\nforever.\n\nI can see the lass now, as she strode along the trace by the flowing\nriver, through sunlight and shadow, straight and supple and strong.\nSometimes she sang like a bird, and the forest rang. Sometimes she would\nmake fun of her grandfather or of me; and again she would be silent for\nan hour at a time, staring ahead, and then I knew she was thinking of\nthat Tom McChesney. She would wake from those reveries with a laugh, and\ngive me a push to send me rolling down a bank.\n\n“What’s the matter, Davy? You look as solemn as a wood-owl. What a\nlittle wiseacre you be!”\n\nOnce I retorted, “You were thinking of that Tom McChesney.”\n\n“Ay, that she was, I’ll warrant,” snapped her grandfather.\n\nPolly Ann replied, with a merry peal of laughter, “You are both jealous\nof Tom--both of you. But, Davy, when you see him you’ll love him as much\nas I do.”\n\n“I’ll not,” I said sturdily.\n\n“He’s a man to look upon--”\n\n“He’s a rip-roarer,” old man Ripley put in. “Ye’re daft about him.”\n\n“That I am,” said Polly, flushing and subsiding; “but he’ll not know\nit.”\n\nAs we rose into the more rugged country we passed more than one charred\ncabin that told its silent story of Indian massacre. Only on the\nscattered hill farms women and boys and old men were working in the\nfields, all save the scalawags having gone to join Rutherford. There\nwere plenty of these around the taverns to make eyes at Polly Ann and\nopen love to her, had she allowed them; but she treated them in return\nto such scathing tirades that they were glad to desist--all but one. He\nmust have been an escaped redemptioner, for he wore jauntily a swanskin\nthree-cornered hat and stained breeches of a fine cloth. He was a bold,\nvain fellow.\n\n“My beauty,” says he, as we sat at supper, “silver and Wedgwood better\nbecome you than pewter and a trencher.”\n\n“And I reckon a rope would sit better on your neck than a ruff,”\n retorted Polly Ann, while the company shouted with laughter. But he was\nnot the kind to become discomfited.\n\n“I’d give a guinea to see you in silk. But I vow your hair looks better\nas it is.”\n\n“Not so yours,” said she, like lightning; “‘twould look better to me\nhanging on the belt of one of them red devils.”\n\nIn the morning, when he would have lifted the pack of alum salt, Polly\nAnn gave him a push that sent him sprawling. But she did it in such good\nnature withal that the fellow mistook her. He scrambled to his feet,\nflung his arm about her waist, and kissed her. Whereupon I hit him with\na sapling, and he staggered and let her go.\n\n“You imp of hell!” he cried, rubbing the bump. He made a vicious dash at\nme that boded no good, but I slipped behind the hominy block; and Polly\nAnn, who was like a panther on her feet, dashed at him and gave him a\nbuffet in the cheek that sent him reeling again.\n\nAfter that we were more devoted friends than ever.\n\nWe travelled slowly, day by day, until I saw the mountains lift blue\nagainst the western sky, and the sight of them was like home once more.\nI loved them; and though I thought with sadness of my father, I was on\nthe whole happier with Polly Ann than I had been in the lonely cabin on\nthe Yadkin. Her spirits flagged a little as she drew near home, but old\nMr. Ripley’s rose.\n\n“There’s Burr’s,” he would say, “and O’Hara’s and Williamson’s,”\nmarking the cabins set amongst the stump-dotted corn-fields. “And thar,”\nsweeping his hand at a blackened heap of logs lying on the stones,\n“thar’s whar Nell Tyler and her baby was sculped.”\n\n“Poor Nell,” said Polly Ann, the tears coming into her eyes as she\nturned away.\n\n“And Jim Tyler was killed gittin’ to the fort. He can’t say I didn’t\nwarn him.”\n\n“I reckon he’ll never say nuthin’, now,” said Polly Ann.\n\nIt was in truth a dismal sight,--the shapeless timbers, the corn,\nplanted with such care, choked with weeds, and the poor utensils of\nthe little family scattered and broken before the door-sill. These same\nIndians had killed my father; and there surged up in my breast that\nhatred of the painted race felt by every backwoods boy in my time.\n\nTowards the end of the day the trace led into a beautiful green valley,\nand in the middle of it was a stream shining in the afternoon sun.\nThen Polly Ann fell entirely silent. And presently, as the shadows grew\npurple, we came to a cabin set under some spreading trees on a knoll\nwhere a woman sat spinning at the door, three children playing at her\nfeet. She stared at us so earnestly that I looked at Polly Ann, and saw\nher redden and pale. The children were the first to come shouting at us,\nand then the woman dropped her wool and ran down the slope straight into\nPolly Ann’s arms. Mr. Ripley halted the horses with a grunt.\n\nThe two women drew off and looked into each other’s faces. Then Polly\nAnn dropped her eyes.\n\n“Have ye--?” she said, and stopped.\n\n“No, Polly Ann, not one word sence Tom and his Pa went. What do folks\nsay in the settlements?”\n\nPolly Ann turned up her nose.\n\n“They don’t know nuthin’ in the settlements,” she replied.\n\n“I wrote to Tom and told him you was gone,” said the older woman. “I\nknowed he’d wanter hear.”\n\nAnd she looked meaningly at Polly Ann, who said nothing. The children\nhad been pulling at the girl’s skirts, and suddenly she made a dash at\nthem. They scattered, screaming with delight, and she after them.\n\n“Howdy, Mr. Ripley?” said the woman, smiling a little.\n\n“Howdy, Mis’ McChesney?” said the old man, shortly.\n\nSo this was the mother of Tom, of whom I had heard so much. She was, in\ntruth, a motherly-looking person, her fleshy face creased with strong\ncharacter.\n\n“Who hev ye brought with ye?” she asked, glancing at me.\n\n“A lad Polly Ann took a shine to in the settlements,” said the old\nman. “Polly Ann! Polly Ann!” he cried sharply, “we’ll hev to be gittin’\nhome.” And then, as though an afterthought (which it really was not), he\nadded, “How be ye for salt, Mis’ McChesney?”\n\n“So-so,” said she.\n\n“Wal, I reckon a little might come handy,” said he. And to the girl who\nstood panting beside him, “Polly, give Mis’ McChesney some salt.”\n\nPolly Ann did, and generously,--the salt they had carried with so much\nlabor threescore and ten miles from the settlements. Then we took our\ndeparture, the girl turning for one last look at Tom’s mother, and at\nthe cabin where he had dwelt. We were all silent the rest of the way,\nclimbing the slender trail through the forest over the gap into the next\nvalley. For I was jealous of Tom. I am not ashamed to own it now.\n\nIn the smoky haze that rises just before night lets her curtain fall, we\ndescended the farther slope, and came to Mr. Ripley’s cabin.\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. IN SIGHT OF THE BLUE WALL ONCE MORE\n\nPolly Ann lived alone with her grandfather, her father and mother having\nbeen killed by Indians some years before. There was that bond between\nus, had we needed one. Her father had built the cabin, a large one with\na loft and a ladder climbing to it, and a sleeping room and a kitchen.\nThe cabin stood on a terrace that nature had levelled, looking across\na swift and shallow stream towards the mountains. There was the truck\npatch, with its yellow squashes and melons, and cabbages and beans,\nwhere Polly Ann and I worked through the hot mornings; and the corn\npatch, with the great stumps of the primeval trees standing in it. All\naround us the silent forest threw its encircling arms, spreading up the\nslopes, higher and higher, to crown the crests with the little pines and\nhemlocks and balsam fir.\n\nThere had been no meat save bacon since the McChesneys had left, for of\nlate game had become scarce, and old Mr. Ripley was too feeble to go on\nthe long hunts. So one day, when Polly Ann was gone across the ridge,\nI took down the long rifle from the buckhorns over the hearth, and the\nhunting knife and powder-horn and pouch beside it, and trudged up the\nslope to a game trail I discovered. All day I waited, until the forest\nlight grew gray, when a buck came and stood over the water, raising\nhis head and stamping from time to time. I took aim in the notch of a\nsapling, brought him down, cleaned and skinned and dragged him into the\nwater, and triumphantly hauled one of his hams down the trail. Polly Ann\ngave a cry of joy when she saw me.\n\n“Davy,” she exclaimed, “little Davy, I reckoned you was gone away from\nus. Gran’pa, here is Davy back, and he has shot a deer.”\n\n“You don’t say?” replied Mr. Ripley, surveying me and my booty with a\ngrim smile.\n\n“How could you, Gran’pa?” said Polly Ann, reproachfully.\n\n“Wal,” said Mr. Ripley, “the gun was gone, an’ Davy. I reckon he ain’t\nsich a little rascal after all.”\n\nPolly Ann and I went up the next day, and brought the rest of the buck\nmerrily homeward. After that I became the hunter of the family; but\noftener than not I returned tired and empty-handed, and ravenously\nhungry. Indeed, our chief game was rattlesnakes, which we killed by the\ndozens in the corn and truck patches.\n\nAs Polly Ann and I went about our daily chores, we would talk of Tom\nMcChesney. Often she would sit idle at the hand-mill, a light in her\neyes that I would have given kingdoms for. One ever memorable morning,\nearly in the crisp autumn, a grizzled man strode up the trail, and Polly\nAnn dropped the ear of corn she was husking and stood still, her bosom\nheaving. It was Mr. McChesney, Tom’s father--alone.\n\n“No, Polly Ann,” he cried, “there ain’t nuthin’ happened. We’ve laid\nout the hill towns. But the Virginny men wanted a guide, and Tom\nvolunteered, and so he ain’t come back with Rutherford’s boys.”\n\nPolly Ann seized him by the shoulders, and looked him in the face.\n\n“Be you tellin’ the truth, Warner McChesney?” she said in a hard voice.\n\n“As God hears me,” said Warner McChesney, solemnly. “He sent ye this.”\n\nHe drew from the bosom of his hunting shirt a soiled piece of birch\nbark, scrawled over with rude writing. Polly seized it, and flew into\nthe house.\n\nThe hickories turned a flaunting yellow, the oaks a copper-red, the\nleaves crackled on the Catawba vines, and still Tom McChesney did not\ncome. The Cherokees were homeless and houseless and subdued,--their hill\ntowns burned, their corn destroyed, their squaws and children wanderers.\nOne by one the men of the Grape Vine settlement returned to save what\nthey might of their crops, and plough for the next year--Burrs, O’Haras,\nWilliamsons, and Winns. Yes, Tom had gone to guide the Virginia boys.\nAll had tales to tell of his prowess, and how he had saved Rutherford’s\nmen from ambush at the risk of his life. To all of which Polly Ann\nlistened with conscious pride, and replied with sallies.\n\n“I reckon I don’t care if he never comes back,” she would cry. “If he\nlikes the Virginny boys more than me, there be others here I fancy more\nthan him.”\n\nWhereupon the informant, if he were not bound in matrimony, would begin\nto make eyes at Polly Ann. Or, if he were bolder, and went at the wooing\nin the more demonstrative fashion of the backwoods--Polly Ann had a way\nof hitting him behind the ear with most surprising effect.\n\nOne windy morning when the leaves were kiting over the valley we were\ngetting ready for pounding hominy, when a figure appeared on the trail.\nSteadying the hood of her sunbonnet with her hand, the girl gazed long\nand earnestly, and a lump came into my throat at the thought that the\ncomer might be Tom McChesney. Polly Ann sat down at the block again in\ndisgust.\n\n“It’s only Chauncey Dike,” she said.\n\n“Who’s Chauncey Dike?” I asked.\n\n“He reckons he’s a buck,” was all that Polly Ann vouchsafed.\n\nChauncey drew near with a strut. He had very long black hair, a new\ncoonskin cap with a long tassel, and a new blue-fringed hunting shirt.\nWhat first caught my eye was a couple of withered Indian scalps that\nhung by their long locks from his girdle. Chauncey Dike was certainly\nhandsome.\n\n“Wal, Polly Ann, are ye tired of hanging out fer Tom?” he cried, when a\ndozen paces away.\n\n“I wouldn’t be if you was the only one left ter choose,” Polly Ann\nretorted.\n\nChauncey Dike stopped in his tracks and haw-hawed with laughter. But I\ncould see that he was not very much pleased.\n\n“Wal,” said he, “I ‘low ye won’t see Tom very soon. He’s gone to\nKaintuckee.”\n\n“Has he?” said Polly Ann, with brave indifference.\n\n“He met a gal on the trail--a blazin’ fine gal,” said Chauncey Dike.\n“She was goin’ to Kaintuckee. And Tom--he ‘lowed he’d go ‘long.”\n\nPolly Ann laughed, and fingered the withered pieces of skin at\nChauncey’s girdle.\n\n“Did Tom give you them sculps?” she asked innocently.\n\nChauncey drew up stiffly.\n\n“Who? Tom McChesney? I reckon he ain’t got none to give. This here’s\nfrom a big brave at Noewee, whar the Virginny boys was surprised.” And\nhe held up the one with the longest tuft. “He’d liked to tomahawked me\nout’n the briers, but I throwed him fust.”\n\n“Shucks,” said Polly Ann, pounding the corn, “I reckon you found him\ndead.”\n\nBut that night, as we sat before the fading red of the backlog, the old\nman dozing in his chair, Polly Ann put her hand on mine.\n\n“Davy,” she said softly, “do you reckon he’s gone to Kaintuckee?”\n\nHow could I tell?\n\nThe days passed. The wind grew colder, and one subdued dawn we awoke to\nfind that the pines had fantastic white arms, and the stream ran black\nbetween white banks. All that day, and for many days after, the snow\nadded silently to the thickness of its blanket, and winter was upon us.\nIt was a long winter and a rare one. Polly Ann sat by the little window\nof the cabin, spinning the flax into linsey-woolsey. And she made a\nhunting shirt for her grandfather, and another little one for me which\nshe fitted with careful fingers. But as she spun, her wheel made the\nonly music--for Polly Ann sang no more. Once I came on her as she was\nthrusting the tattered piece of birch bark into her gown, but she never\nspoke to me more of Tom McChesney. When, from time to time, the snow\nmelted on the hillsides, I sometimes surprised a deer there and shot him\nwith the heavy rifle. And so the months wore on till spring.\n\nThe buds reddened and popped, and the briers grew pink and white.\nThrough the lengthening days we toiled in the truck patch, but always\nas I bent to my work Polly Ann’s face saddened me--it had once been so\nbright, and it should have been so at this season. Old Mr. Ripley grew\nquerulous and savage and hard to please. In the evening, when my work\nwas done, I often lay on the banks of the stream staring at the high\nridge (its ragged edges the setting sun burned a molten gold), and the\nthought grew on me that I might make my way over the mountains into that\nland beyond, and find Tom for Polly Ann. I even climbed the watershed to\nthe east as far as the O’Hara farm, to sound that big Irishman about the\ntrail. For he had once gone to Kentucky, to come back with his scalp\nand little besides. O’Hara, with his brogue, gave me such a terrifying\nnotion of the horrors of the Wilderness Trail that I threw up all\nthought of following it alone, and so I resolved to wait until I heard\nof some settlers going over it. But none went from the Grape Vine\nsettlement that spring.\n\nWar was a-waging in Kentucky. The great Indian nations were making a\nfrantic effort to drive from their hunting grounds the little bands of\nsettlers there, and these were in sore straits.\n\nSo I waited, and gave Polly Ann no hint of my intention.\n\nSometimes she herself would slip away across the notch to see Mrs.\nMcChesney and the children. She never took me with her on these\njourneys, but nearly always when she came back at nightfall her eyes\nwould be red, and I knew the two women had been weeping together. There\ncame a certain hot Sunday in July when she went on this errand, and\nGrandpa Ripley having gone to spend the day at old man Winn’s, I was\nleft alone. I remember I sat on the squared log of the door-step,\nwondering whether, if I were to make my way to Salisbury, I could fall\nin with a party going across the mountains into Kentucky. And wondering,\nlikewise, what Polly Ann would do without me. I was cleaning the long\nrifle,--a labor I loved,--when suddenly I looked up, startled to see a\nman standing in front of me. How he got there I know not. I stared at\nhim. He was a young man, very spare and very burned, with bright red\nhair and blue eyes that had a kind of laughter in them, and yet were\nsober. His buckskin hunting shirt was old and stained and frayed by the\nbriers, and his leggins and moccasins were wet from fording the stream.\nHe leaned his chin on the muzzle of his gun.\n\n“Folks live here, sonny?” said he.\n\nI nodded.\n\n“Whar be they?”\n\n“Out,” said I.\n\n“Comin’ back?” he asked.\n\n“To-night,” said I, and began to rub the lock.\n\n“Be they good folks?” said he.\n\n“Yes,” I answered.\n\n“Wal,” said he, making a move to pass me, “I reckon I’ll slip in and\ntake what I’ve a mind to, and move on.”\n\nNow I liked the man’s looks very much, but I did not know what he would\ndo. So I got in his way and clutched the gun. It was loaded, but not\nprimed, and I emptied a little powder from the flask in the pan. At that\nhe grinned.\n\n“You’re a good boy, sonny,” he said. “Do you reckon you could hit me if\nyou shot?”\n\n“Yes,” I said. But I knew I could scarcely hold the gun out straight\nwithout a rest.\n\n“And do you reckon I could hit you fust?” he asked.\n\nAt that I laughed, and he laughed.\n\n“What’s your name?”\n\nI told him.\n\n“Who do you love best in all the world?” said he.\n\nIt was a queer question. But I told him Polly Ann Ripley.\n\n“Oh!” said he, after a pause. “And what’s she like?”\n\n“She’s beautiful,” I said; “she’s been very kind to me. She took me home\nwith her from the settlements when I had no place to go. She’s good.”\n\n“And a sharp tongue, I reckon,” said he.\n\n“When people need it,” I answered.\n\n“Oh!” said he. And presently, “She’s very merry, I’ll warrant.”\n\n“She used to be, but that’s gone by,” I said.\n\n“Gone by!” said he, his voice falling, “is she sick?”\n\n“No,” said I, “she’s not sick, she’s sad.”\n\n“Sad?” said he. It was then I noticed that he had a cut across his\ntemple, red and barely healed. “Do you reckon your Polly Ann would give\nme a little mite to eat?”\n\nThis time I jumped up, ran into the house, and got down some corn-pone\nand a leg of turkey. For that was the rule of the border. He took them\nin great bites, but slowly, and he picked the bones clean.\n\n“I had breakfast yesterday morning,” said he, “about forty mile from\nhere.”\n\n“And nothing since?” said I, in astonishment.\n\n“Fresh air and water and exercise,” said he, and sat down on the grass.\nHe was silent for a long while, and so was I. For a notion had struck\nme, though I hardly dared to give it voice.\n\n“Are you going away?” I asked at last.\n\nHe laughed.\n\n“Why?” said he.\n\n“If you were going to Kaintuckee--” I began, and faltered. For he stared\nat me very hard.\n\n“Kaintuckee!” he said. “There’s a country! But it’s full of blood and\nInjun varmints now. Would you leave Polly Ann and go to Kaintuckee?”\n\n“Are you going?” I said.\n\n“I reckon I am,” he said, “as soon as I kin.”\n\n“Will you take me?” I asked, breathless. “I--I won’t be in your way, and\nI can walk--and--shoot game.”\n\nAt that he bent back his head and laughed, which made me redden with\nanger. Then he turned and looked at me more soberly.\n\n“You’re a queer little piece,” said he. “Why do you want to go thar?”\n\n“I want to find Tom McChesney for Polly Ann,” I said.\n\nHe turned away his face.\n\n“A good-for-nothing scamp,” said he.\n\n“I have long thought so,” I said.\n\nHe laughed again. It was a laugh that made me want to join him, had I\nnot been irritated.\n\n“And he’s a scamp, you say. And why?”\n\n“Else he would be coming back to Polly Ann.”\n\n“Mayhap he couldn’t,” said the stranger.\n\n“Chauncey Dike said he went off with another girl, into Kaintuckee.”\n\n“And what did Polly Ann say to that?” the stranger demanded.\n\n“She asked Chauncey if Tom McChesney gave him the scalps he had on his\nbelt.”\n\nAt that he laughed in good earnest, and slapped his breech-clouts\nrepeatedly. All at once he stopped, and stared up the ridge.\n\n“Is that Polly Ann?” said he.\n\nI looked, and far up the trail was a speck.\n\n“I reckon it is,” I answered, and wondered at his eyesight. “She travels\nover to see Tom McChesney’s Ma once in a while.”\n\nHe looked at me queerly.\n\n“I reckon I’ll go here and sit down, Davy,” said he, “so’s not to be in\nthe way.” And he walked around the corner of the house.\n\nPolly Ann sauntered down the trail slowly, as was her wont after such\nan occasion. And the man behind the house twice whispered with extreme\ncaution, “How near is she?” before she came up the path.\n\n“Have you been lonesome, Davy?” she said.\n\n“No,” said I, “I’ve had a visitor.”\n\n“It’s not Chauncey Dike again?” she said. “He doesn’t dare show his face\nhere.”\n\n“No, it wasn’t Chauncey. This man would like to have seen you, Polly\nAnn. He--” here I braced myself,--“he knew Tom McChesney. He called him\na good-for-nothing scamp.”\n\n“He did--did he!” said Polly Ann, very low. “I reckon it was good for\nhim I wasn’t here.”\n\nI grinned.\n\n“What are you laughing at, you little monkey,” said Polly Ann, crossly.\n“‘Pon my soul, sometimes I reckon you are a witch.”\n\n“Polly Ann,” I said, “did I ever do anything but good to you?”\n\nShe made a dive at me, and before I could escape caught me in her strong\nyoung arms and hugged me.\n\n“You’re the best friend I have, little Davy,” she cried.\n\n“I reckon that’s so,” said the stranger, who had risen and was standing\nat the corner.\n\nPolly Ann looked at him like a frightened doe. And as she stared,\nuncertain whether to stay or fly, the color surged into her cheeks and\nmounted to her fair forehead.\n\n“Tom!” she faltered.\n\n“I’ve come back, Polly Ann,” said he. But his voice was not so clear as\na while ago.\n\nThen Polly Ann surprised me.\n\n“What made you come back?” said she, as though she didn’t care a\nminkskin. Whereat Mr. McChesney shifted his feet.\n\n“I reckon it was to fetch you, Polly Ann.”\n\n“I like that!” cried she. “He’s come to fetch me, Davy.” That was the\nfirst time in months her laugh had sounded natural. “I heerd you fetched\none gal acrost the mountains, and now you want to fetch another.”\n\n“Polly Ann,” says he, “there was a time when you knew a truthful man\nfrom a liar.”\n\n“That time’s past,” retorted she; “I reckon all men are liars. What are\nye tom-foolin’ about here for, Tom McChesney, when yere Ma’s breakin’\nher heart? I wonder ye come back at all.”\n\n“Polly Ann,” says he, very serious, “I ain’t a boaster. But when I think\nwhat I come through to git here, I wonder that I come back at all. The\nfolks shut up at Harrod’s said it was sure death ter cross the mountains\nnow. I’ve walked two hundred miles, and fed seven times, and my sculp’s\nas near hangin’ on a Red Stick’s belt as I ever want it to be.”\n\n“Tom McChesney,” said Polly Ann, with her hands on her hips and her\nsunbonnet tilted, “that’s the longest speech you ever made in your\nlife.”\n\nI declare I lost my temper with Polly Ann then, nor did I blame Tom\nMcChesney for turning on his heel and walking away. But he had gone\nno distance at all before Polly Ann, with three springs, was at his\nshoulder.\n\n“Tom!” she said very gently.\n\nHe hesitated, stopped, thumped the stock of his gun on the ground, and\nwheeled. He looked at her doubtingly, and her eyes fell to the ground.\n\n“Tom McChesney,” said she, “you’re a born fool with wimmen.”\n\n“Thank God for that,” said he, his eyes devouring her.\n\n“Ay,” said she. And then, “You want me to go to Kaintuckee with you?”\n\n“That’s what I come for,” he stammered, his assurance all run away\nagain.\n\n“I’ll go,” she answered, so gently that her words were all but blown\naway by the summer wind. He laid his rifle against a stump at the\nedge of the corn-field, but she bounded clear of him. Then she stood,\npanting, her eyes sparkling.\n\n“I’ll go,” she said, raising her finger, “I’ll go for one thing.”\n\n“What’s that?” he demanded.\n\n“That you’ll take Davy along with us.”\n\nThis time Tom had her, struggling like a wild thing in his arms, and\nkissing her black hair madly. As for me, I might have been in the next\nsettlement for all they cared. And then Polly Ann, as red as a holly\nberry, broke away from him and ran to me, caught me up, and hid her face\nin my shoulder. Tom McChesney stood looking at us, grinning, and that\nday I ceased to hate him.\n\n“There’s no devil ef I don’t take him, Polly Ann,” said he. “Why, he was\na-goin’ to Kaintuckee ter find me for you.”\n\n“What?” said she, raising her head.\n\n“That’s what he told me afore he knew who I was. He wanted to know ef\nI’d fetch him thar.”\n\n“Little Davy!” cried Polly Ann.\n\nThe last I saw of them that day they were going off up the trace towards\nhis mother’s, Polly Ann keeping ahead of him and just out of his reach.\nAnd I was very, very happy. For Tom McChesney had come back at last, and\nPolly Ann was herself once more.\n\nAs long as I live I shall never forget Polly Ann’s wedding.\n\nShe was all for delay, and such a bunch of coquetry as I have never\nseen. She raised one objection after another; but Tom was a firm man,\nand his late experiences in the wilderness had made him impatient of\ntrifling. He had promised the Kentucky settlers, fighting for their\nlives in their blockhouses, that he would come back again. And a\nresolute man who was a good shot was sorely missed in the country in\nthose days.\n\nIt was not the thousand dangers and hardships of the journey across\nthe Wilderness Trail that frightened Polly Ann. Not she. Nor would she\nlisten to Tom when he implored her to let him return alone, to come back\nfor her when the redskins had got over the first furies of their hatred.\nAs for me, the thought of going with them into that promised land was\nlike wine. Wondering what the place was like, I could not sleep of\nnights.\n\n“Ain’t you afeerd to go, Davy?” said Tom to me.\n\n“You promised Polly Ann to take me,” said I, indignantly.\n\n“Davy,” said he, “you ain’t over handsome. ‘Twouldn’t improve yere looks\nto be bald. They hev a way of takin’ yere ha’r. Better stay behind with\nGran’pa Ripley till I kin fetch ye both.”\n\n“Tom,” said Polly Ann, “you kin just go back alone if you don’t take\nDavy.”\n\nSo one of the Winn boys agreed to come over to stay with old Mr. Ripley\nuntil quieter times.\n\nThe preparations for the wedding went on apace that week. I had not\nthought that the Grape Vine settlement held so many people. And they\ncame from other settlements, too, for news spread quickly in that\ncountry, despite the distances. Tom McChesney was plainly a favorite\nwith the men who had marched with Rutherford. All the week they\ncame, loaded with offerings, turkeys and venison and pork and bear\nmeat--greatest delicacy of all--until the cool spring was filled for the\nfeast. From thirty miles down the Broad, a gaunt Baptist preacher on a\nfat white pony arrived the night before. He had been sent for to tie the\nknot.\n\nPolly Ann’s wedding-day dawned bright and fair, and long before the sun\nglistened on the corn tassels we were up and clearing out the big room.\nThe fiddlers came first--a merry lot. And then the guests from afar\nbegan to arrive. Some of them had travelled half the night. The\nbridegroom’s friends were assembling at the McChesney place. At last,\nwhen the sun was over the stream, rose such Indian war-whoops and shots\nfrom the ridge trail as made me think the redskins were upon us. The\nshouts and hurrahs grew louder and louder, the quickening thud of\nhorses’ hoofs was heard in the woods, and there burst into sight of the\nassembly by the truck patch two wild figures on crazed horses charging\ndown the path towards the house. We scattered to right and left. On they\ncame, leaping logs and brush and ditches, until one of them pulled up,\nyelling madly, at the very door, the foam-flecked sides of his horse\nmoving with quick heaves.\n\nIt was Chauncey Dike, and he had won the race for the bottle of “Black\nBetty,”--Chauncey Dike, his long, black hair shining with bear’s oil.\nAmid the cheers of the bride’s friends he leaped from his saddle,\nmounted a stump and, flapping his arms, crowed in victory. Before he had\ndone the vanguard of the groom’s friends were upon us, pell-mell, all in\nthe finest of backwoods regalia,--new hunting shirts, trimmed with bits\nof color, and all armed to the teeth--scalping knife, tomahawk, and all.\nNor had Chauncey Dike forgotten the scalp of the brave who leaped at him\nout of the briers at Neowee.\n\nPolly Ann was radiant in a white linen gown, woven and sewed by her own\nhands. It was not such a gown as Mrs. Temple, Nick’s mother, would have\nworn, and yet she was to me an hundred times more beautiful than\nthat lady in all her silks. Peeping out from under it were the little\nblue-beaded moccasins which Tom himself had brought across the mountains\nin the bosom of his hunting shirt. Polly Ann was radiant, and yet at\ntimes so rapturously shy that when the preacher announced himself ready\nto tie the knot she ran into the house and hid in the cupboard--for\nPolly Ann was a child of nature. Thence, coloring like a wild rose,\nshe was dragged by a boisterous bevy of girls in linsey-woolsey to\nthe spreading maple of the forest that stood on the high bank over the\nstream. The assembly fell solemn, and not a sound was heard save the\nbreathing of Nature in the heyday of her time. And though I was happy,\nthe sobs rose in my throat. There stood Polly Ann, as white now as the\nbleached linen she wore, and Tom McChesney, tall and spare and broad, as\nstrong a figure of a man as ever I laid eyes on. God had truly made that\ncouple for wedlock in His leafy temple.\n\nThe deep-toned words of the preacher in prayer broke the stillness.\nThey were made man and wife. And then began a day of merriment, of\nunrestraint, such as the backwoods alone knows. The feast was spread\nout in the long grass under the trees--sides of venison, bear meat,\ncorn-pone fresh baked by Mrs. McChesney and Polly Ann herself, and all\nthe vegetables in the patch. There was no stint, either, of maple beer\nand rum and “Black Betty,” and toasts to the bride and groom amidst\ngusts of laughter “that they might populate Kaintuckee.” And Polly Ann\nwould have it that I should sit by her side under the maple.\n\nThe fiddlers played, and there were foot races and shooting matches. Ay,\nand wrestling matches in the severe manner of the backwoods between the\nyoung bucks, more than one of which might have ended seriously were it\nnot for the high humor of the crowd. Tom McChesney himself was in most\nof them, a hot favorite. By a trick he had learned in the Indian country\nhe threw Chauncey Dike (no mean adversary) so hard that the backwoods\ndandy lay for a moment in sleep. Contrary to the custom of many, Tom was\nnot in the habit of crowing on such occasions, nor did he even smile as\nhe helped Chauncey to his feet. But Polly Ann knew, and I knew, that he\nwas thinking of what Chauncey had said to her.\n\nSo the long summer afternoon wore away into twilight, and the sun fell\nbehind the blue ridges we were to cross. Pine knots were lighted in the\nbig room, the fiddlers set to again, and then came jigs and three and\nfour handed reels that made the puncheons rattle,--chicken-flutter\nand cut-the-buckle,--and Polly Ann was the leader now, the young men\nflinging the girls from fireplace to window in the reels, and back\nagain; and when, panting and perspiring, the lass was too tired to stand\nlonger, she dropped into the hospitable lap of the nearest buck who was\nperched on the bench along the wall awaiting his chance. For so it went\nin the backwoods in those days, and long after, and no harm in it that\never I could see.\n\nWell, suddenly, as if by concert, the music stopped, and a shout of\nlaughter rang under the beams as Polly Ann flew out of the door with the\ngirls after her, as swift of foot as she. They dragged her, a struggling\ncaptive, to the bride-chamber which made the other end of the house, and\nwhen they emerged, blushing and giggling and subdued, the fun began with\nTom McChesney. He gave the young men a pretty fight indeed, and long\nbefore they had him conquered the elder guests had made their escape\nthrough door and window.\n\nAll night the reels and jigs went on, and the feasting and drinking too.\nIn the fine rain that came at dawn to hide the crests, the company rode\nwearily homeward through the notches.\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. THE NOLLICHUCKY TRACE\n\n\n Some to endure, and many to quail,\n Some to conquer, and many to fail,\n Toiling over the Wilderness Trail.\n\nAs long as I live I shall never forget the morning we started on our\njourney across the Blue Wall. Before the sun chased away the filmy veil\nof mist from the brooks in the valley, the McChesneys, father, mother,\nand children, were gathered to see us depart. And as they helped us to\ntighten the packsaddles Tom himself had made from chosen tree-forks,\nthey did not cease lamenting that we were going to certain death. Our\nscrawny horses splashed across the stream, and we turned to see a gaunt\nand lonely figure standing apart against the sun, stern and sorrowful.\nWe waved our hands, and set our faces towards Kaintuckee.\n\nTom walked ahead, rifle on shoulder, then Polly Ann; and lastly I drove\nthe two shaggy ponies, the instruments of husbandry we had been able\nto gather awry on their packs,--a scythe, a spade, and a hoe. I\ntriumphantly carried the axe.\n\nIt was not long before we were in the wilderness, shut in by mountain\ncrags, and presently Polly Ann forgot her sorrows in the perils of the\ntrace. Choked by briers and grapevines, blocked by sliding stones and\nearth, it rose and rose through the heat and burden of the day until\nit lost itself in the open heights. As the sun was wearing down to the\nwestern ridges the mischievous sorrel mare turned her pack on a sapling,\nand one of the precious bags burst. In an instant we were on our knees\ngathering the golden meal in our hands. Polly Ann baked journeycakes on\na hot stone from what we saved under the shiny ivy leaves, and scarce\nhad I spancelled the horses ere Tom returned with a fat turkey he had\nshot.\n\n“Was there ever sech a wedding journey!” said Polly Ann, as we sat about\nthe fire, for the mountain air was chill. “And Tom and Davy as grave as\nparsons. Ye’d guess one of you was Rutherford himself, and the other Mr.\nBoone.”\n\nNo wonder he was grave. I little realized then the task he had set\nhimself, to pilot a woman and a lad into a country haunted by frenzied\nsavages, when single men feared to go this season. But now he smiled,\nand patted Polly Ann’s brown hand.\n\n“It’s one of yer own choosing, lass,” said he.\n\n“Of my own choosing!” cried she. “Come, Davy, we’ll go back to Grandpa.”\n\nTom grinned.\n\n“I reckon the redskins won’t bother us till we git by the Nollichucky\nand Watauga settlements,” he said.\n\n“The redskins!” said Polly Ann, indignant; “I reckon if one of ‘em did\ngit me he’d kiss me once in a while.”\n\nWhereupon Tom, looking more sheepish still, tried to kiss her, and\nfailed ignominiously, for she vanished into the dark woods.\n\n“If a redskin got you here,” said Tom, when she had slipped back, “he’d\nfetch you to Nick-a-jack Cave.”\n\n“What’s that?” she demanded.\n\n“Where all the red and white and yellow scalawags over the mountains\nis gathered,” he answered. And he told of a deep gorge between towering\nmountains where a great river cried angrily, of a black cave out of\nwhich a black stream ran, where a man could paddle a dugout for miles\ninto the rock. The river was the Tennessee, and the place the resort\nof the Chickamauga bandits, pirates of the mountains, outcasts of all\nnations. And Dragging Canoe was their chief.\n\nIt was on the whole a merry journey, the first part of it, if a rough\none. Often Polly Ann would draw me to her and whisper: “We’ll hold out,\nDavy. He’ll never know.” When the truth was that the big fellow was\ngoing at half his pace on our account. He told us there was no fear of\nredskins here, yet, when the scream of a painter or the hoot of an owl\nstirred me from my exhausted slumber, I caught sight of him with his\nback to a tree, staring into the forest, his rifle at his side. The day\nwas dawning.\n\n“Turn about’s fair,” I expostulated.\n\n“Ye’ll need yere sleep, Davy,” said he, “or ye’ll never grow any\nbigger.”\n\n“I thought Kaintuckee was to the west,” I said, “and you’re making\nnorth.” For I had observed him day after day. We had left the trails.\nSometimes he climbed tree, and again he sent me to the upper branches,\nwhence I surveyed a sea of tree-tops waving in the wind, and looked\nonward to where a green velvet hollow lay nestling on the western side\nof a saddle-backed ridge.\n\n“North!” said Tom to Polly Ann, laughing. “The little devil will beat\nme at woodcraft soon. Ay, north, Davy. I’m hunting for the Nollichucky\nTrace that leads to the Watauga settlement.”\n\nIt was wonderful to me how he chose his way through the mountains. Once\nin a while we caught sight of a yellow blaze in a tree, made by himself\nscarce a month gone, when he came southward alone to fetch Polly Ann.\nAgain, the tired roan shied back from the bleached bones of a traveller,\npicked clean by wolves. At sundown, when we loosed our exhausted horses\nto graze on the wet grass by the streams, Tom would go off to look for a\ndeer or turkey, and often not come back to us until long after darkness\nhad fallen.\n\n“Davy’ll take care of you, Polly Ann,” he would say as he left us.\n\nAnd she would smile at him bravely and say, “I reckon I kin look out for\nDavy awhile yet.”\n\nBut when he was gone, and the crooning stillness set in, broken only by\nthe many sounds of the night, we would sit huddled together by the fire.\nIt was dread for him she felt, not for herself. And in both our minds\nrose red images of hideous foes skulking behind his brave form as he\ntrod the forest floor. Polly Ann was not the woman to whimper.\n\nAnd yet I have but dim recollections of this journey. It was no hardship\nto a lad brought up in woodcraft. Fear of the Indians, like a dog\nshivering with the cold, was a deadened pain on the border.\n\nStrangely enough it was I who chanced upon the Nollichucky Trace, which\nfollows the meanderings of that river northward through the great Smoky\nMountains. It was made long ago by the Southern Indians as they threaded\ntheir way to the Hunting Lands of Kaintuckee, and shared now by Indian\ntraders. The path was redolent with odors, and bright with mountain\nshrubs and flowers,--the pink laurel bush, the shining rhododendron, and\nthe grape and plum and wild crab. The clear notes of the mountain birds\nwere in our ears by day, and the music of the water falling over the\nledges, mingled with that of the leaves rustling in the wind, lulled us\nto sleep at night. High above us, as we descended, the gap, from naked\ncrag to timber-covered ridge, was spanned by the eagle’s flight. And\nvirgin valleys, where future generations were to be born, spread out and\nnarrowed again,--valleys with a deep carpet of cane and grass, where the\ndeer and elk and bear fed unmolested.\n\nIt was perchance the next evening that my eyes fell upon a sight which\nis one of the wonders of my boyish memories. The trail slipped to the\nedge of a precipice, and at our feet the valley widened. Planted\namidst giant trees, on a shining green lawn that ran down to the racing\nNollichucky was the strangest house it has ever been my lot to see--of\nno shape, of huge size, and built of logs, one wing hitched to another\nby “dog alleys” (as we called them); and from its wide stone chimneys\nthe pearly smoke rose upward in the still air through the poplar\nbranches. Beyond it a setting sun gilded the corn-fields, and horses and\ncattle dotted the pastures. We stood for a while staring at this oasis\nin the wilderness, and to my boyish fancy it was a fitting introduction\nto a delectable land.\n\n“Glory be to heaven!” exclaimed Polly Ann.\n\n“It’s Nollichucky Jack’s house,” said Tom.\n\n“And who may he be?” said she.\n\n“Who may he be!” cried Tom; “Captain John Sevier, king of the border,\nand I reckon the best man to sweep out redskins in the Watauga\nsettlements.”\n\n“Do you know him?” said she.\n\n“I was chose as one of his scouts when we fired the Cherokee hill towns\nlast summer,” said Tom, with pride. “Thar was blood and thunder for ye!\nWe went down the Great War-path which lies below us, and when we was\nthrough there wasn’t a corn-shuck or a wigwam or a war post left. We\ndidn’t harm the squaws nor the children, but there warn’t no prisoners\ntook. When Nollichucky Jack strikes I reckon it’s more like a\nthunderbolt nor anything else.”\n\n“Do you think he’s at home, Tom?” I asked, fearful that I should not see\nthis celebrated person.\n\n“We’ll soon l’arn,” said he, as we descended. “I heerd he was agoin’ to\npunish them Chickamauga robbers by Nick-a-jack.”\n\nJust then we heard a prodigious barking, and a dozen hounds came\ncharging down the path at our horses’ legs, the roan shying into\nthe truck patch. A man’s voice, deep, clear, compelling, was heard\ncalling:--\n\n“Vi! Flora! Ripper!”\n\nI saw him coming from the porch of the house, a tall slim figure in a\nhunting shirt--that fitted to perfection--and cavalry boots. His face,\nhis carriage, his quick movement and stride filled my notion of a hero,\nand my instinct told me he was a gentleman born.\n\n“Why, bless my soul, it’s Tom McChesney!” he cried, ten paces away,\nwhile Tom grinned with pleasure at the recognition. “But what have you\nhere?”\n\n“A wife,” said Tom, standing on one foot.\n\nCaptain Sevier fixed his dark blue eyes on Polly Ann with approbation,\nand he bowed to her very gracefully.\n\n“Where are you going, Ma’am, may I ask?” he said.\n\n“To Kaintuckee,” said Polly Ann.\n\n“To Kaintuckee!” cried Captain Sevier, turning to Tom. “Egad, then,\nyou’ve no right to a wife,--and to such a wife,” and he glanced again at\nPolly Ann. “Why, McChesney, you never struck me as a rash man. Have you\nlost your senses, to take a woman into Kentucky this year?”\n\n“So the forts be still in trouble?” said Tom.\n\n“Trouble?” cried Mr. Sevier, with a quick fling of his whip at an unruly\nhound, “Harrodstown, Boonesboro, Logan’s Fort at St. Asaph’s,--they\ndon’t dare stick their noses outside the stockades. The Indians have\nswarmed into Kentucky like red ants, I tell you. Ten days ago, when I\nwas in the Holston settlements, Major Ben Logan came in. His fort had\nbeen shut up since May, they were out of powder and lead, and somebody\nhad to come. How did he come? As the wolf lopes, nay, as the crow flies\nover crag and ford, Cumberland, Clinch, and all, forty miles a day for\nfive days, and never saw a trace--for the war parties were watching the\nWilderness Road.” And he swung again towards Polly Ann. “You’ll not go\nto Kaintuckee, ma’am; you’ll stay here with us until the redskins are\nbeaten off there. He may go if he likes.”\n\n“I reckon we didn’t come this far to give out, Captain Sevier,” said\nshe.\n\n“You don’t look to be the kind to give out, Mrs. McChesney,” said he.\n“And yet it may not be a matter of giving out,” he added more soberly.\nThis mixture of heartiness and gravity seemed to sit well on him.\n“Surely you have been enterprising, Tom. Where in the name of the\nContinental Congress did you get the lad?”\n\n“I married him along with Polly Ann,” said Tom. “That was the bargain,\nand I reckon he was worth it.”\n\n“I’d take a dozen to get her,” declared Mr. Sevier, while Polly Ann\nblushed. “Well, well, supper’s waiting us, and cider and applejack, for\nwe don’t get a wedding party every day. Some gentlemen are here whose\nword may have more weight and whose attractions may be greater than\nmine.”\n\nHe whistled to a negro lad, who took our horses, and led us through the\ncourt-yard and the house to the lawn at the far side of it. A rude table\nwas set there under a great tree, and around it three gentlemen were\ntalking. My memory of all of them is more vivid than it might be were\ntheir names not household words in the Western country. Captain Sevier\nstartled them.\n\n“My friends,” said he, “if you have despatches for Kaintuckee, I pray\nyou get them ready over night.”\n\nThey looked up at him, one sternly, the other two gravely.\n\n“What the devil do you mean, Sevier?” said the stern one.\n\n“That my friend, Tom McChesney, is going there with his wife, unless we\ncan stop him,” said Sevier.\n\n“Stop him!” thundered the stern gentleman, kicking back his chair and\nstraightening up to what seemed to me a colossal height. I stared at\nhim, boylike. He had long, iron-gray hair and a creased, fleshy face\nand sunken eyes. He looked as if he might stop anybody as he turned upon\nTom. “Who the devil is this Tom McChesney?” he demanded.\n\nSevier laughed.\n\n“The best scout I ever laid eyes on,” said he. “A deadly man with\na Deckard, an unerring man at choosing a wife” (and he bowed to the\nreddening Polly Ann), “and a fool to run the risk of losing her.”\n\n“Tut, tut,” said the iron gentleman, who was the famous Captain Evan\nShelby of King’s Meadows, “he’ll leave her here in our settlements while\nhe helps us fight Dragging Canoe and his Chickamauga pirates.”\n\n“If he leaves me,” said Polly Ann, her eyes flashing, “that’s an end to\nthe bargain. He’ll never find me more.”\n\nCaptain Sevier laughed again.\n\n“There’s spirit for you,” he cried, slapping his whip against his boot.\n\nAt this another gentleman stood up, a younger counterpart of the\nfirst, only he towered higher and his shoulders were broader. He had a\nbig-featured face, and pleasant eyes--that twinkled now--sunken in, with\nfleshy creases at the corners.\n\n“Tom McChesney,” said he, “don’t mind my father. If any man besides\nLogan can get inside the forts, you can. Do you remember me?”\n\n“I reckon I do, Mr. Isaac Shelby,” said Tom, putting a big hand into Mr.\nShelby’s bigger one. “I reckon I won’t soon forget how you stepped\nout of ranks and tuk command when the boys was runnin’, and turned the\ntide.”\n\nHe looked like the man to step out of ranks and take command.\n\n“Pish!” said Mr. Isaac Shelby, blushing like a girl; “where would I have\nbeen if you and Moore and Findley and the rest hadn’t stood ‘em off till\nwe turned round?”\n\nBy this time the third gentleman had drawn my attention. Not by anything\nhe said, for he remained silent, sitting with his dark brown head bent\nforward, quietly gazing at the scene from under his brows. The\ninstant he spoke they turned towards him. He was perhaps forty, and\nbroad-shouldered, not so tall as Mr. Sevier.\n\n“Why do you go to Kaintuckee, McChesney?” he asked.\n\n“I give my word to Mr. Harrod and Mr. Clark to come back, Mr.\nRobertson,” said Tom.\n\n“And the wife? If you take her, you run a great risk of losing her.”\n\n“And if he leaves me,” said Polly Ann, flinging her head, “he will lose\nme sure.”\n\nThe others laughed, but Mr. Robertson merely smiled.\n\n“Faith,” cried Captain Sevier, “if those I met coming back\nhelter-skelter over the Wilderness Trace had been of that stripe, they’d\nhave more men in the forts now.”\n\nWith that the Captain called for supper to be served where we sat. He\nwas a widower, with lads somewhere near my own age, and I recall being\nshown about the place by them. And later, when the fireflies glowed and\nthe Nollichucky sang in the darkness, we listened to the talk of the\nwar of the year gone by. I needed not to be told that before me were the\nrenowned leaders of the Watauga settlements. My hero worship cried it\naloud within me. These captains dwelt on the border-land of mystery,\nconquered the wilderness, and drove before them its savage tribes by\ntheir might. When they spoke of the Cherokees and told how that same\nStuart--the companion of Cameron--was urging them to war against our\npeople, a fierce anger blazed within me. For the Cherokees had killed my\nfather.\n\nI remember the men,--scarcely what they said: Evan Shelby’s words, like\nheavy blows on an anvil; Isaac Shelby’s, none the less forceful;\nJames Robertson compelling his listeners by some strange power. He was\nperchance the strongest man there, though none of us guessed, after\nruling that region, that he was to repeat untold hardships to found and\nrear another settlement farther west. But best I loved to hear Captain\nSevier, whose talk lacked not force, but had a daring, a humor, a\nlightness of touch, that seemed more in keeping with that world I had\nleft behind me in Charlestown. Him I loved, and at length I solved the\npuzzle. To me he was Nick Temple grown to manhood.\n\nI slept in the room with Captain Sevier’s boys, and one window of it was\nof paper smeared with bear’s grease, through which the sunlight came all\nbleared and yellow in the morning. I had a boy’s interest in affairs,\nand I remember being told that the gentlemen were met here to discuss\nthe treaty between themselves and the great Oconostota, chief of the\nCherokees, and also to consider the policy of punishing once for all\nDragging Canoe and his bandits at Chickamauga.\n\nAs we sat at breakfast under the trees, these gentlemen generously\ndropped their own business to counsel Tom, and I observed with pride\nthat he had gained their regard during the last year’s war. Shelby’s\nthreats and Robertson’s warnings and Sevier’s exhortations having no\neffect upon his determination to proceed to Kentucky, they began to\nadvise him how to go, and he sat silent while they talked. And finally,\nwhen they asked him, he spoke of making through Carter’s Valley for\nCumberland Gap and the Wilderness Trail.\n\n“Egad,” cried Captain Sevier, “I have so many times found the boldest\nplan the safest that I have become a coward that way. What do you say to\nit, Mr. Robertson?”\n\nMr. Robertson leaned his square shoulders over the table.\n\n“He may fall in with a party going over,” he answered, without looking\nup.\n\nPolly Ann looked at Tom as if to say that the whole Continental Army\ncould not give her as much protection.\n\nWe left that hospitable place about nine o’clock, Mr. Robertson having\nwritten a letter to Colonel Daniel Boone,--shut up in the fort at\nBoonesboro,--should we be so fortunate as to reach Kaintuckee: and\nanother to a young gentleman by the name of George Rogers Clark,\napparently a leader there. Captain Sevier bowed over Polly Ann’s hand\nas if she were a great lady, and wished her a happy honeymoon, and me he\npatted on the head and called a brave lad. And soon we had passed beyond\nthe corn-field into the Wilderness again.\n\nOur way was down the Nollichucky, past the great bend of it below\nLick Creek, and so to the Great War-path, the trail by which countless\nparties of red marauders had travelled north and south. It led, indeed,\nnortheast between the mountain ranges. Although we kept a watch by day\nand night, we saw no sign of Dragging Canoe or his men, and at length\nwe forded the Holston and came to the scattered settlement in Carter’s\nValley.\n\nI have since racked my brain to remember at whose cabin we stopped\nthere. He was a rough backwoodsman with a wife and a horde of children.\nBut I recall that a great rain came out of the mountains and down the\nvalley. We were counting over the powder gourds in our packs, when there\nburst in at the door as wild a man as has ever been my lot to see. His\nbrown beard was grown like a bramble patch, his eye had a violet light,\nand his hunting shirt was in tatters. He was thin to gauntness, ate\nravenously of the food that was set before him, and throwing off his\nsoaked moccasins, he spread his scalded feet to the blaze, and the\nsteaming odor of drying leather filled the room.\n\n“Whar be ye from?” asked Tom.\n\nFor answer the man bared his arm, then his shoulder, and two angry\nscars, long and red, revealed themselves, and around his wrists were\ndeep gouges where he had been bound.\n\n“They killed Sue,” he cried, “sculped her afore my very eyes. And they\nchopped my boy outen the hickory withes and carried him to the Creek\nNation. At a place where there was a standin’ stone I broke loose from\nthree of ‘em and come here over the mountains, and I ain’t had nothin’,\nstranger, but berries and chainey brier-root for ten days. God damn\n‘em!” he cried, standing up and tottering with the pain in his feet, “if\nI can get a Deckard--”\n\n“Will you go back?” said Tom.\n\n“Go back!” he shouted, “I’ll go back and fight ‘em while I have blood in\nmy body.”\n\nHe fell into a bunk, but his sorrow haunted him even in his troubled\nsleep, and his moans awed us as we listened. The next day he told us his\nstory with more calmness. It was horrible indeed, and might well have\nfrightened a less courageous woman than Polly Ann. Imploring her not to\ngo, he became wild again, and brought tears to her eyes when he spoke of\nhis own wife. “They tomahawked her, ma’am, because she could not walk,\nand the baby beside her, and I standing by with my arms tied.”\n\nAs long as I live I shall never forget that scene, and how Tom pleaded\nwith Polly Ann to stay behind, but she would not listen to him.\n\n“You’re going, Tom?” she said.\n\n“Yes,” he answered, turning away, “I gave ‘em my word.”\n\n“And your word to me?” said Polly Ann.\n\nHe did not answer.\n\nWe fixed on a Saturday to start, to give the horses time to rest, and in\nthe hope that we might hear of some relief party going over the Gap. On\nThursday Tom made a trip to the store in the valley, and came back with\na Deckard rifle he had bought for the stranger, whose name was Weldon.\nThere was no news from Kaintuckee, but the Carter’s Valley settlers\nseemed to think that matters were better there. It was that same night,\nI believe, that two men arrived from Fort Chiswell. One, whose name was\nCutcheon, was a little man with a short forehead and a bad eye, and he\nwore a weather-beaten blue coat of military cut. The second was a big,\nlight-colored, fleshy man, and a loud talker. He wore a hunting shirt\nand leggings. They were both the worse for rum they had had on the road,\nthe big man talking very loud and boastfully.\n\n“Afeard to go to Kaintuckee!” said he. “I’ve met a parcel o’ cowards\non the road, turned back. There ain’t nothin’ to be afeard of, eh,\nstranger?” he added, to Tom, who paid no manner of attention to him. The\nsmall man scarce opened his mouth, but sat with his head bowed forward\non his breast when he was not drinking. We passed a dismal, crowded\nnight in the room with such companions. When they heard that we were to\ngo over the mountains, nothing would satisfy the big man but to go with\nus.\n\n“Come, stranger,” said he to Tom, “two good rifles such as we is ain’t\nto be throwed away.”\n\n“Why do you want to go over?” asked Tom. “Be ye a Tory?” he demanded\nsuspiciously.\n\n“Why do you go over?” retorted Riley, for that was his name. “I reckon\nI’m no more of a Tory than you.”\n\n“Whar did ye come from?” said Tom.\n\n“Chiswell’s mines, taking out lead for the army o’ Congress. But there\nain’t excitement enough in it.”\n\n“And you?” said Tom, turning to Cutcheon and eying his military coat.\n\n“I got tired of their damned discipline,” the man answered surlily. He\nwas a deserter.\n\n“Look you,” said Tom, sternly, “if you come, what I say is law.”\n\nSuch was the sacrifice we were put to by our need of company. But in\nthose days a man was a man, and scarce enough on the Wilderness Trail\nin that year of ‘77. So we started away from Carter’s Valley on a bright\nSaturday morning, the grass glistening after a week’s rain, the road\nsodden, and the smell of the summer earth heavy. Tom and Weldon walked\nahead, driving the two horses, followed by Cutcheon, his head dropped\nbetween his shoulders. The big man, Riley, regaled Polly Ann.\n\n“My pluck is,” said he, “my pluck is to give a redskin no chance. Shoot\n‘em down like hogs. It takes a good un to stalk me, Ma’am. Up on the\nKanawha I’ve had hand-to-hand fights with ‘em, and made ‘em cry quits.”\n\n“Law!” exclaimed Polly Ann, nudging me, “it was a lucky thing we run\ninto you in the valley.”\n\nBut presently we left the road and took a mountain trail,--as stiff a\nclimb as we had yet had. Polly Ann went up it like a bird, talking all\nthe while to Riley, who blew like a bellows. For once he was silent.\n\nWe spent two, perchance three, days climbing and descending and fording.\nAt night Tom would suffer none to watch save Weldon and himself, not\ntrusting Riley or Cutcheon. And the rascals were well content to sleep.\nAt length we came to a cabin on a creek, the corn between the stumps\naround it choked with weeds, and no sign of smoke in the chimney. Behind\nit slanted up, in giant steps, a forest-clad hill of a thousand feet,\nand in front of it the stream was dammed and lined with cane.\n\n“Who keeps house?” cried Tom, at the threshold.\n\nHe pushed back the door, fashioned in one great slab from a forest tree.\nHis welcome was an angry whir, and a huge yellow rattler lay coiled\nwithin, his head reared to strike. Polly Ann leaned back.\n\n“Mercy,” she cried, “that’s a bad sign.”\n\nBut Tom killed the snake, and we made ready to use the cabin that night\nand the next day. For the horses were to be rested and meat was to\nbe got, as we could not use our guns so freely on the far side of\nCumberland Gap. In the morning, before he and Weldon left, Tom took me\naround the end of the cabin.\n\n“Davy,” said he, “I don’t trust these rascals. Kin you shoot a pistol?”\n\nI reckoned I could.\n\nHe had taken one out of the pack he had got from Captain Sevier and\npushed it between the logs where the clay had fallen out. “If they try\nanything,” said he, “shoot ‘em. And don’t be afeard of killing ‘em.” He\npatted me on the back, and went off up the slope with Weldon. Polly Ann\nand I stood watching them until they were out of sight.\n\nAbout eleven o’clock Riley and Cutcheon moved off to the edge of a\ncane-brake near the water, and sat there for a while, talking in low\ntones. The horses were belled and spancelled near by, feeding on the\ncane and wild grass, and Polly Ann was cooking journey-cakes on a stone.\n\n“What makes you so sober, Davy?” she said.\n\nI didn’t answer.\n\n“Davy,” she cried, “be happy while you’re young. ‘Tis a fine day, and\nKaintuckee’s over yonder.” She picked up her skirts and sang:--\n\n “First upon the heeltap,\n Then upon the toe.”\n\nThe men by the cane-brake turned and came towards us.\n\n“Ye’re happy to-day, Mis’ McChesney,” said Riley.\n\n“Why shouldn’t I be?” said Polly Ann; “we’re all a-goin’ to Kaintuckee.”\n\n“We’re a-goin’ back to Cyarter’s Valley,” said Riley, in his blustering\nway. “This here ain’t as excitin’ as I thought. I reckon there ain’t no\nredskins nohow.”\n\n“What!” cried Polly Ann, in loud scorn, “ye’re a-goin’ to desert?\nThere’ll be redskins enough by and by, I’ll warrant ye.”\n\n“How’d you like to come along of us,” says Riley; “that ain’t any place\nfor wimmen, over yonder.”\n\n“Along of you!” cried Polly Ann, with flashing eyes. “Do you hear that,\nDavy?”\n\nI did. Meanwhile the man Cutcheon was slowly walking towards her. It\ntook scarce a second for me to make up my mind. I slipped around the\ncorner of the house, seized the pistol, primed it with a trembling hand,\nand came back to behold Polly Ann, with flaming cheeks, facing them.\nThey did not so much as glance at me. Riley held a little back of the\ntwo, being the coward. But Cutcheon stood ready, like a wolf.\n\nI did not wait for him to spring, but, taking the best aim I could with\nmy two hands, fired. With a curse that echoed in the crags, he threw up\nhis arms and fell forward, writhing, on the turf.\n\n“Run for the cabin, Polly Ann,” I shouted, “and bar the door.”\n\nThere was no need. For an instant Riley wavered, and then fled to the\ncane.\n\nPolly Ann and I went to the man on the ground, and turned him over. His\neyes slid upwards. There was a bloody froth on his lips.\n\n“Davy!” cried she, awestricken, “Davy, ye’ve killed him!”\n\nI grew dizzy and sick at the thought, but she caught me and held me to\nher. Presently we sat down on the door log, gazing at the corpse. Then I\nbegan to reflect, and took out my powder gourd and loaded the pistol.\n\n“What are ye a-doing?” she said.\n\n“In case the other one comes back,” said I.\n\n“Pooh,” said Polly Ann, “he’ll not come back.” Which was true. I have\nnever laid eyes on Riley to this day.\n\n“I reckon we’d better fetch it out of the sun,” said she, after a while.\nAnd so we dragged it under an oak, covered the face, and left it.\n\nHe was the first man I ever killed, and the business by no means came\nnatural to me. And that day the journey-cakes which Polly Ann had made\nwere untasted by us both. The afternoon dragged interminably. Try as we\nwould, we could not get out of our minds the Thing that lay under the\noak.\n\nIt was near sundown when Tom and Weldon appeared on the mountain side\ncarrying a buck between them. Tom glanced from one to the other of us\nkeenly. He was very quick to divine.\n\n“Whar be they?” said he.\n\n“Show him, Davy,” said Polly Ann.\n\nI took him over to the oak, and Polly Ann told him the story. He gave\nme one look, I remember, and there was more of gratitude in it than in a\nthousand words. Then he seized a piece of cold cake from the stone.\n\n“Which trace did he take?” he demanded of me.\n\nBut Polly Ann hung on his shoulder.\n\n“Tom, Tom!” she cried, “you beant goin’ to leave us again. Tom, he’ll\ndie in the wilderness, and we must git to Kaintuckee.”\n\nThe next vivid thing in my memory is the view of the last barrier Nature\nhad reared between us and the delectable country. It stood like a lion\nat the gateway, and for some minutes we gazed at it in terror from\nPowell’s Valley below. How many thousands have looked at it with sinking\nhearts! How many weaklings has its frown turned back! There seemed to\nbe engraved upon it the dark history of the dark and bloody land beyond.\nNothing in this life worth having is won for the asking; and the best is\nfought for, and bled for, and died for. Written, too, upon that towering\nwall of white rock, in the handwriting of God Himself, is the history of\nthe indomitable Race to which we belong.\n\nFor fifty miles we travelled under it, towards the Gap, our eyes drawn\nto it by a resistless fascination. The sun went over it early in the\nday, as though glad to leave the place, and after that a dark scowl\nwould settle there. At night we felt its presence, like a curse. Even\nPolly Ann was silent. And she had need to be now. When it was necessary,\nwe talked in low tones, and the bell-clappers on the horses were not\nloosed at night. It was here, but four years gone, that Daniel Boone’s\nfamily was attacked, and his son killed by the Indians.\n\nWe passed, from time to time, deserted cabins and camps, and some places\nthat might once have been called settlements: Elk Garden, where the\npioneers of the last four years had been wont to lay in a simple supply\nof seed corn and Irish potatoes; and the spot where Henderson and his\ncompany had camped on the way to establish Boonesboro two years before.\nAnd at last we struck the trace that mounted upward to the Gateway\nitself.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. ON THE WILDERNESS TRAIL\n\nAnd now we had our hands upon the latch, and God alone knew what was\nbehind the gate. Toil, with a certainty, but our lives had known it.\nDeath, perchance. But Death had been near to all of us, and his presence\ndid not frighten. As we climbed towards the Gap, I recalled with strange\naptness a quaint saying of my father’s that Kaintuckee was the Garden\nof Eden, and that men were being justly punished with blood for their\npresumption.\n\nAs if to crown that judgment, the day was dark and lowering, with\nshowers of rain from time to time. And when we spoke,--Polly Ann and\nI,--it was in whispers. The trace was very narrow, with Daniel Boone’s\nblazes, two years old, upon the trees; but the way was not over steep.\nCumberland Mountain was as silent and deserted as when the first man had\nknown it.\n\nAlas, for the vanity of human presage! We gained the top, and entered\nunmolested. No Eden suddenly dazzled our eye, no splendor burst upon it.\nNothing told us, as we halted in our weariness, that we had reached the\nPromised Land. The mists weighed heavily on the evergreens of the slopes\nand hid the ridges, and we passed that night in cold discomfort. It was\nthe first of many without a fire.\n\nThe next day brought us to the Cumberland, tawny and swollen from the\nrains, and here we had to stop to fell trees to make a raft on which to\nferry over our packs. We bound the logs together with grapevines, and as\nwe worked my imagination painted for me many a red face peering from\nthe bushes on the farther shore. And when we got into the river and were\ncaught and spun by the hurrying stream, I hearkened for a shot from\nthe farther bank. While Polly Ann and I were scrambling to get the raft\nlanded, Tom and Weldon swam over with the horses. And so we lay the\nsecond night dolefully in the rain. But not so much as a whimper escaped\nfrom Polly Ann. I have often told her since that the sorest trial she\nhad was the guard she kept on her tongue,--a hardship indeed for one of\nIrish inheritance. Many a pull had she lightened for us by a flash of\nhumor.\n\nThe next morning the sun relented, and the wine of his dawn was wine\nindeed to our flagging hopes. Going down to wash at the river’s brink,\nI heard a movement in the cane, and stood frozen and staring until a\ngreat, bearded head, black as tar, was thrust out between the stalks and\nlooked at me with blinking red eyes. The next step revealed the hump\nof the beast, and the next his tasselled tail lashing his dirty brown\nquarters. I did not tarry longer, but ran to tell Tom. He made bold to\nrisk a shot and light a fire, and thus we had buffalo meat for some days\nafter.\n\nWe were still in the mountains. The trail led down the river for a bit\nthrough the worst of canebrakes, and every now and again we stopped\nwhile Tom and Weldon scouted. Once the roan mare made a dash through the\nbrake, and, though Polly Ann burst through one way to head her off and\nI another, we reached the bank of Richland Creek in time to see her nose\nand the top of her pack above the brown water. There was nothing for it\nbut to swim after her, which I did, and caught her quietly feeding in\nthe cane on the other side. By great good fortune the other horse bore\nthe powder.\n\n“Drat you, Nancy,” said Polly Ann to the mare, as she handed me my\nclothes, “I’d sooner carry the pack myself than be bothered with you.”\n\n“Hush,” said I, “the redskins will get us.”\n\nPolly Ann regarded me scornfully as I stood bedraggled before her.\n\n“Redskins!” she cried. “Nonsense! I reckon it’s all talk about\nredskins.”\n\nBut we had scarce caught up ere we saw Tom standing rigid with his hand\nraised. Before him, on a mound bared of cane, were the charred remains\nof a fire. The sight of them transformed Weldon. His eyes glared again,\neven as when we had first seen him, curses escaped under his breath, and\nhe would have darted into the cane had not Tom seized him sternly by the\nshoulder. As for me, my heart hammered against my ribs, and I grew\nsick with listening. It was at that instant that my admiration for\nTom McChesney burst bounds, and that I got some real inkling of what\nwoodcraft might be. Stepping silently between the tree trunks, his eyes\nbent on the leafy loam, he found a footprint here and another there, and\nsuddenly he went into the cane with a sign to us to remain. It seemed an\nage before he returned. Then he began to rake the ashes, and, suddenly\nbending down, seized something in them,--the broken bowl of an Indian\npipe.\n\n“Shawnees!” he said; “I reckoned so.” It was at length the beseeching in\nPolly Ann’s eyes that he answered.\n\n“A war party--tracks three days old. They took poplar.”\n\nTo take poplar was our backwoods expression for embarking in a canoe,\nthe dugouts being fashioned from the great poplar trees.\n\nI did not reflect then, as I have since and often, how great was the\nknowledge and resource Tom practised that day. Our feeling for him\n(Polly Ann’s and mine) fell little short of worship. In company ill\nat ease, in the forest he became silent and masterful--an unerring\nwoodsman, capable of meeting the Indian on his own footing. And,\nstrangest thought of all, he and many I could name who went into\nKentucky, had escaped, by a kind of strange fate, being born in the\nnorth of Ireland. This was so of Andrew Jackson himself.\n\nThe rest of the day he led us in silence down the trace, his eye alert\nto penetrate every corner of the forest, his hand near the trigger\nof his long Deckard. I followed in boylike imitation, searching\nevery thicket for alien form and color, and yearning for stature and\nresponsibility. As for poor Weldon, he would stride for hours at a time\nwith eyes fixed ahead, a wild figure,--ragged and fringed. And we knew\nthat the soul within him was torn with thoughts of his dead wife and\nof his child in captivity. Again, when the trance left him, he was an\naddition to our little party not to be despised.\n\nAt dark Polly Ann and I carried the packs across a creek on a fallen\ntree, she taking one end and I the other. We camped there, where the\nloam was trampled and torn by countless herds of bison, and had only\nparched corn and the remains of a buffalo steak for supper, as the meal\nwas mouldy from its wetting, and running low. When Weldon had gone a\nlittle distance up the creek to scout, Tom relented from the sternness\nwhich his vigilance imposed and came and sat down on a log beside Polly\nAnn and me.\n\n“‘Tis a hard journey, little girl,” he said, patting her; “I reckon I\ndone wrong to fetch you.”\n\nI can see him now, as the twilight settled down over the wilderness,\nhis honest face red and freckled, but aglow with the tenderness it had\nhidden during the day, one big hand enfolding hers, and the other on my\nshoulder.\n\n“Hark, Davy!” said Polly Ann, “he’s fair tired of us already. Davy, take\nme back.”\n\n“Hush, Polly Ann,” he answered, delighted at her raillery. “But I’ve a\nword to say to you. If we come on to the redskins, you and Davy make for\nthe cane as hard as you kin kilter. Keep out of sight.”\n\n“As hard as we kin kilter!” exclaimed Polly Ann, indignantly. “I reckon\nnot, Tom McChesney. Davy taught me to shoot long ago, afore you made up\nyour mind to come back from Kaintuckee.”\n\nTom chuckled. “So Davy taught you to shoot,” he said, and checked\nhimself. “He ain’t such a bad one with a pistol,”--and he patted\nme,--“but I allow ye’d better hunt kiver just the same. And if they\nketch ye, Polly Ann, just you go along and pretend to be happy, and\ntear off a snatch of your dress now and then, if you get a chance. It\nwouldn’t take me but a little time to run into Harrodstown or Boone’s\nStation from here, and fetch a party to follow ye.”\n\nTwo days went by,--two days of strain in sunlight, and of watching and\nfitful sleep in darkness. But the Wilderness Trail was deserted. Here\nand there a lean-to--silent remnant of the year gone by--spoke of the\nlittle bands of emigrants which had once made their way so cheerfully to\nthe new country. Again it was a child’s doll, the rags of it beaten\nby the weather to a rusty hue. Every hour that we progressed seemed to\njustify the sagacity and boldness of Tom’s plan, nor did it appear to\nhave entered a painted skull that a white man would have the hardihood\nto try the trail this year. There were neither signs nor sounds save\nNature’s own, the hoot of the wood-owl, the distant bark of a mountain\nwolf, the whir of a partridge as she left her brood. At length we could\nstand no more the repression that silence and watching put upon us, and\nwhen a rotten bank gave way and flung Polly Ann and the sorrel mare into\na creek, even Weldon smiled as we pulled her, bedraggled and laughing,\nfrom the muddy water. This was after we had ferried the Rockcastle\nRiver.\n\nOur trace rose and fell over height and valley, until we knew that we\nwere come to a wonderland at last. We stood one evening on a spur as the\nsetting sun flooded the natural park below us with a crystal light and,\nstriking a tall sycamore, turned its green to gold. We were now on the\nhills whence the water ran down to nourish the fat land, and I could\nscarce believe that the garden spot on which our eyes feasted could be\nthe scene of the blood and suffering of which we had heard. Here at last\nwas the fairyland of my childhood, the country beyond the Blue Wall.\n\nWe went down the river that led into it, with awe, as though we were\ntrespassers against God Himself,--as though He had made it too beautiful\nand too fruitful for the toilers of this earth. And you who read this\nan hundred years hence may not believe the marvels of it to the pioneer,\nand in particular to one born and bred in the scanty, hard soil of the\nmountains. Nature had made it for her park,--ay, and scented it with her\nown perfumes. Giant trees, which had watched generations come and go,\nsome of which mayhap had been saplings when the Norman came to England,\ngrew in groves,--the gnarled and twisted oak, and that godsend to the\nsettlers, the sugar-maple; the coffee tree with its drooping buds; the\nmulberry, the cherry, and the plum; the sassafras and the pawpaw;\nthe poplar and the sycamore, slender maidens of the forest, garbed\nin daintier colors,--ay, and that resplendent brunette with the white\nflowers, the magnolia; and all underneath, in the green shade, enamelled\nbanks which the birds themselves sought to rival.\n\nAt length, one afternoon, we came to the grove of wild apple trees so\nlovingly spoken of by emigrants as the Crab Orchard, and where formerly\nthey had delighted to linger. The plain near by was flecked with the\nbrown backs of feeding buffalo, but we dared not stop, and pressed on to\nfind a camp in the forest. As we walked in the filtered sunlight we had\na great fright, Polly Ann and I. Shrill, discordant cries suddenly burst\nfrom the branches above us, and a flock of strange, green birds flecked\nwith red flew over our heads. Even Tom, intent upon the trail, turned\nand laughed at Polly Ann as she stood clutching me.\n\n“Shucks,” said he, “they’re only paroquets.”\n\nWe made our camp in a little dell where there was short green grass by\nthe brookside and steep banks overgrown with brambles on either hand.\nTom knew the place, and declared that we were within thirty miles of the\nstation. A giant oak had blown down across the water, and, cutting out\na few branches of this, we spread our blankets under it on the turf.\nTethering our faithful beasts, and cutting a quantity of pea-vine for\ntheir night’s food, we lay down to sleep, Tom taking the first watch.\n\nI had the second, for Tom trusted me now, and glorying in that trust I\nwas alert and vigilant. A shy moon peeped at me between the trees, and\nwas fantastically reflected in the water. The creek rippled over the\nlimestone, and an elk screamed in the forest far beyond. When at length\nI had called Weldon to take the third watch, I lay down with a sense of\npeace, soothed by the sweet odors of the night.\n\nI awoke suddenly. I had been dreaming of Nick Temple and Temple Bow, and\nmy father coming back to me there with a great gash in his shoulder like\nWeldon’s. I lay for a moment dazed by the transition, staring through\nthe gray light. Then I sat up, the soft stamping and snorting of\nthe horses in my ears. The sorrel mare had her nose high, her tail\ntwitching, but there was no other sound in the leafy wilderness. With\na bound of returning sense I looked for Weldon. He had fallen asleep on\nthe bank above, his body dropped across the trunk of the oak. I leaped\non the trunk and made my way along it, stepping over him, until I\nreached and hid myself in the great roots of the tree on the bank above.\nThe cold shiver of the dawn was in my body as I waited and listened.\nShould I wake Tom? The vast forest was silent, and yet in its shadowy\ndepths my imagination drew moving forms. I hesitated.\n\nThe light grew: the boles of the trees came out, one by one, through the\npurple. The tangled mass down the creek took on a shade of green, and\na faint breath came from the southward. The sorrel mare sniffed it, and\nstamped. Then silence again,--a long silence. Could it be that the cane\nmoved in the thicket? Or had my eyes deceived me? I stared so hard that\nit seemed to rustle all over. Perhaps some deer were feeding there,\nfor it was no unusual thing, when we rose in the morning, to hear the\nwhistle of a startled doe near our camping ground. I was thoroughly\nfrightened now,--and yet I had the speculative Scotch mind. The thicket\nwas some one hundred and fifty yards above, and on the flooded lands\nat a bend. If there were Indians in it, they could not see the sleeping\nforms of our party under me because of a bend in the stream. They might\nhave seen me, though I had kept very still in the twisted roots of the\noak, and now I was cramped. If Indians were there, they could determine\nour position well enough by the occasional stamping and snorting of the\nhorses. And this made my fear more probable, for I had heard that horses\nand cattle often warned pioneers of the presence of redskins.\n\nAnother thing: if they were a small party, they would probably seek to\nsurprise us by coming out of the cane into the creek bed above the\nbend, and stalk down the creek. If a large band, they would surround and\noverpower us. I drew the conclusion that it must be a small party--if a\nparty at all. And I would have given a shot in the arm to be able to see\nover the banks of the creek. Finally I decided to awake Tom.\n\nIt was no easy matter to get down to where he was without being seen\nby eyes in the cane. I clung to the under branches of the oak, finally\nreached the shelving bank, and slid down slowly. I touched him on the\nshoulder. He awoke with a start, and by instinct seized the rifle lying\nbeside him.\n\n“What is it, Davy?” he whispered.\n\nI told what had happened and my surmise. He glanced then at the restless\nhorses and nodded, pointing up at the sleeping figure of Weldon, in full\nsight on the log. The Indians must have seen him.\n\nTom picked up the spare rifle.\n\n“Davy,” said he, “you stay here beside Polly Ann, behind the oak. You\nkin shoot with a rest; but don’t shoot,” said he, earnestly, “for God’s\nsake don’t shoot unless you’re sure to kill.”\n\nI nodded. For a moment he looked at the face of Polly Ann, sleeping\npeacefully, and the fierce light faded from his eyes. He brushed her on\nthe cheek and she awoke and smiled at him, trustfully, lovingly. He put\nhis finger to his lips.\n\n“Stay with Davy,” he said. Turning to me, he added: “When you wake\nWeldon, wake him easy. So.” He put his hand in mine, and gradually\ntightened it. “Wake him that way, and he won’t jump.”\n\nPolly Ann asked no questions. She looked at Tom, and her soul was in\nher face. She seized the pistol from the blanket. Then we watched him\ncreeping down the creek on his belly, close to the bank. Next we moved\nbehind the fallen tree, and I put my hand in Weldon’s. He woke with a\nsigh, started, but we drew him down behind the log. Presently he climbed\ncautiously up the bank and took station in the muddy roots of the tree.\nThen we waited, watching Tom with a prayer in our hearts. Those who have\nnot felt it know not the fearfulness of waiting for an Indian attack.\n\nAt last Tom reached the bend in the bank, beside some red-bud bushes,\nand there he stayed. A level shaft of light shot through the forest. The\nbirds, twittering, awoke. A great hawk soared high in the blue over our\nheads. An hour passed. I had sighted the rifle among the yellow leaves\nof the fallen oak an hundred times. But Polly Ann looked not once to\nthe right or left. Her eyes and her prayers followed the form of her\nhusband.\n\nThen, like the cracking of a great drover’s whip, a shot rang out in the\nstillness, and my hands tightened over the rifle-stock. A piece of bark\nstruck me in the face, and a dead leaf fluttered to the ground. Almost\ninstantly there was another shot, and a blue wisp of smoke rose from the\nred-bud bushes, where Tom was. The horses whinnied, there was a rustle\nin the cane, and silence. Weldon bent over.\n\n“My God!” he whispered hoarsely, “he hit one. Tom hit one.”\n\nI felt Polly Ann’s hand on my face.\n\n“Davy dear,” she said, “are ye hurt?”\n\n“No,” said I, dazed, and wondering why Weldon had not been shot long ago\nas he slumbered. I was burning to climb the bank and ask him whether he\nhad seen the Indian fall.\n\nAgain there was silence,--a silence even more awful than before. The\nsun crept higher, the magic of his rays turning the creek from black to\ncrystal, and the birds began to sing again. And still there was no sign\nof the treacherous enemy that lurked about us. Could Tom get back? I\nglanced at Polly Ann. The same question was written in her yearning\neyes, staring at the spot where the gray of his hunting shirt showed\nthrough the bushes at the bend. Suddenly her hand tightened on mine. The\nhunting shirt was gone!\n\nAfter that, in the intervals when my terror left me, I tried to\nspeculate upon the plan of the savages. Their own numbers could not\nbe great, and yet they must have known from our trace how few we\nwere. Scanning the ground, I noted that the forest was fairly clean of\nundergrowth on both sides of us. Below, the stream ran straight, but\nthere were growths of cane and briers. Looking up, I saw Weldon faced\nabout. It was the obvious move.\n\nBut where had Tom gone?\n\nNext my eye was caught by a little run fringed with bushes that curved\naround the cane near the bend. I traced its course, unconsciously, bit\nby bit, until it reached the edge of a bank not fifty feet away.\n\nAll at once my breath left me. Through the tangle of bramble stems at\nthe mouth of the run, above naked brown shoulders there glared at me,\nhideously streaked with red, a face. Had my fancy lied? I stared again\nuntil my eyes were blurred, now tortured by doubt, now so completely\nconvinced that my fingers almost released the trigger,--for I had thrown\nthe sights into line over the tree. I know not to this day whether I\nshot from determination or nervousness. My shoulder bruised by the kick,\nthe smoke like a veil before my face, it was some moments ere I knew\nthat the air was full of whistling bullets; and then the gun was torn\nfrom my hands, and I saw Polly Ann ramming in a new charge.\n\n“The pistol, Davy,” she cried.\n\nOne torture was over, another on. Crack after crack sounded from the\nforest--from here and there and everywhere, it seemed--and with a song\nthat like a hurtling insect ran the scale of notes, the bullets buried\nthemselves in the trunk of our oak with a chug. Once in a while I heard\nWeldon’s answering shot, but I remembered my promise to Tom not to waste\npowder unless I were sure. The agony was the breathing space we had\nwhile they crept nearer. Then we thought of Tom, and I dared not glance\nat Polly Ann for fear that the sight of her face would unnerve me.\n\nThen a longing to kill seized me, a longing so strange and fierce that\nI could scarce be still. I know now that it comes in battle to all men,\nand with intensity to the hunted, and it explained to me more clearly\nwhat followed. I fairly prayed for the sight of a painted form, and time\nafter time my fancy tricked me into the notion that I had one. And even\nas I searched the brambles at the top of the run a puff of smoke rose\nout of them, a bullet burying itself in the roots near Weldon, who fired\nin return. I say that I have some notion of what possessed the man, for\nhe was crazed with passion at fighting the race which had so cruelly\nwronged him. Horror-struck, I saw him swing down from the bank, splash\nthrough the water with raised tomahawk, and gain the top of the run.\nIn less time than it takes me to write these words he had dragged a\nhideous, naked warrior out of the brambles, and with an avalanche of\ncrumbling earth they slid into the waters of the creek. Polly Ann and I\nstared transfixed at the fearful fight that followed, nor can I give any\nadequate description of it. Weldon had struck through the brambles, but\nthe savage had taken the blow on his gun-barrel and broken the handle of\nthe tomahawk, and it was man to man as they rolled in the shallow water,\nlocked in a death embrace. Neither might reach for his knife, neither\nwas able to hold the other down, Weldon’s curses surcharged with hatred,\nthe Indian straining silently save for a gasp or a guttural note,\nthe white a bearded madman, the savage a devil with a glistening,\npaint-streaked body, his features now agonized as his muscles strained\nand cracked, now lighted with a diabolical joy. But the pent-up rage of\nmonths gave the white man strength.\n\nPolly Ann and I were powerless for fear of shooting Weldon, and gazed\nabsorbed at the fiendish scene with eyes not to be withdrawn. The\ntree-trunk shook. A long, bronze arm reached out from above, and a\npainted face glowered at us from the very roots where Weldon had lain.\nThat moment I took to be my last, and in it I seemed to taste all\neternity. I heard but faintly a noise beyond. It was the shock of the\nheavy Indian falling on Polly Ann and me as we cowered under the trunk,\nand even then there was an instant that we stood gazing at him as at a\nworm writhing in the clay. It was she who fired the pistol and made\nthe great hole in his head, and so he twitched and died. After that a\nconfusion of shots, war-whoops, a vision of two naked forms flying from\ntree to tree towards the cane, and then--God be praised--Tom’s voice\nshouting:--\n\n“Polly Ann! Polly Ann!”\n\nBefore she had reached the top of the bank Tom had her in his arms,\nand a dozen tall gray figures leaped the six feet into the stream and\nstopped. My own eyes turned with theirs to see the body of poor Weldon\nlying face downward in the water. But beyond it a tragedy awaited me.\nDefiant, immovable, save for the heaving of his naked chest, the savage\nwho had killed him stood erect with folded arms facing us. The smoke\ncleared away from a gleaming rifle-barrel, and the brave staggered and\nfell and died as silent as he stood, his feathers making ripples in the\nstream. It was cold-blooded, if you like, but war in those days was to\nthe death, and knew no mercy. The tall backwoodsman who had shot him\nwaded across the stream, and in the twinkling of an eye seized the\nscalp-lock and ran it round with his knife, holding up the bleeding\ntrophy with a shout. Staggering to my feet, I stretched myself, but I\nhad been cramped so long that I tottered and would have fallen had not\nTom’s hand steadied me.\n\n“Davy!” he cried. “Thank God, little Davy! the varmints didn’t get ye.”\n\n“And you, Tom?” I answered, looking up at him, bewildered with\nhappiness.\n\n“They was nearer than I suspicioned when I went off,” he said, and\nlooked at me curiously. “Drat the little deevil,” he said\naffectionately, and his voice trembled, “he took care of Polly Ann, I’ll\nwarrant.”\n\nHe carried me to the top of the bank, where we were surrounded by the\nwhole band of backwoodsmen.\n\n“That he did!” cried Polly Ann, “and fetched a redskin yonder as clean\nas you could have done it, Tom.”\n\n“The little deevil!” exclaimed Tom again.\n\nI looked up, burning with this praise from Tom (for I had never thought\nof praise nor of anything save his happiness and Polly Ann’s). I looked\nup, and my eyes were caught and held with a strange fascination by\nfearless blue ones that gazed down into them. I give you but a poor\ndescription of the owner of these blue eyes, for personal magnetism\nsprings not from one feature or another. He was a young man,--perhaps\nfive and twenty as I now know age,--woodsman-clad, square-built,\nsun-reddened. His hair might have been orange in one light and\nsand-colored in another. With a boy’s sense of such things I knew that\nthe other woodsmen were waiting for him to speak, for they glanced at\nhim expectantly.\n\n“You had a near call, McChesney,” said he, at length; “fortunate for you\nwe were after this band,--shot some of it to pieces yesterday morning.”\n He paused, looking at Tom with that quality of tribute which comes\nnaturally to a leader of men. “By God,” he said, “I didn’t think you’d\ntry it.”\n\n“My word is good, Colonel Clark,” answered Tom, simply.\n\nYoung Colonel Clark glanced at the lithe figure of Polly Ann. He\nseemed a man of few words, for he did not add to his praise of Tom’s\nachievement by complimenting her as Captain Sevier had done. In fact,\nhe said nothing more, but leaped down the bank and strode into the water\nwhere the body of Weldon lay, and dragged it out himself. We gathered\naround it silently, and two great tears rolled down Polly Ann’s cheeks\nas she parted the hair with tenderness and loosened the clenched hands.\nNor did any of the tall woodsmen speak. Poor Weldon! The tragedy of his\nlife and death was the tragedy of Kentucky herself. They buried him by\nthe waterside, where he had fallen.\n\nBut there was little time for mourning on the border. The burial\nfinished, the Kentuckians splashed across the creek, and one of them,\nstooping with a shout at the mouth of the run, lifted out of the\nbrambles a painted body with drooping head and feathers trailing.\n\n“Ay, Mac,” he cried, “here’s a sculp for ye.”\n\n“It’s Davy’s,” exclaimed Polly Ann from the top of the bank; “Davy shot\nthat one.”\n\n“Hooray for Davy,” cried a huge, strapping backwoodsman who stood beside\nher, and the others laughingly took up the shout. “Hooray for Davy.\nBring him over, Cowan.” The giant threw me on his shoulder as though\nI had been a fox, leaped down, and took the stream in two strides. I\nlittle thought how often he was to carry me in days to come, but I felt\na great awe at the strength of him, as I stared into his rough features\nand his veined and weathered skin. He stood me down beside the Indian’s\nbody, smiled as he whipped my hunting knife from my belt, and said,\n“Now, Davy, take the sculp.”\n\nNothing loath, I seized the Indian by the long scalp-lock, while my big\nfriend guided my hand, and amid laughter and cheers I cut off my first\ntrophy of war. Nor did I have any other feeling than fierce hatred of\nthe race which had killed my father.\n\nThose who have known armies in their discipline will find it difficult\nto understand the leadership of the border. Such leadership was granted\nonly to those whose force and individuality compelled men to obey them.\nI had my first glimpse of it that day. This Colonel Clark to whom Tom\ndelivered Mr. Robertson’s letter was perchance the youngest man in the\ncompany that had rescued us, saving only a slim lad of seventeen whom\nI noticed and envied, and whose name was James Ray. Colonel Clark, so\nI was told by my friend Cowan, held that title in Kentucky by reason of\nhis prowess.\n\nClark had been standing quietly on the bank while I had scalped my first\nredskin. Then he called Tom McChesney to him and questioned him closely\nabout our journey, the signs we had seen, and, finally, the news in the\nWatauga settlements. While this was going on the others gathered round\nthem.\n\n“What now?” asked Cowan, when he had finished.\n\n“Back to Harrodstown,” answered the Colonel, shortly.\n\nThere was a brief silence, followed by a hoarse murmur from a thick-set\nman at the edge of the crowd, who shouldered his way to the centre of\nit.\n\n“We set out to hunt a fight, and my pluck is to clean up. We ain’t\nfinished ‘em yet.”\n\nThe man had a deep, coarse voice that was a piece with his roughness.\n\n“I reckon this band ain’t a-goin’ to harry the station any more,\nMcGary,” cried Cowan.\n\n“By Job, what did we come out for? Who’ll take the trail with me?”\n\nThere were some who answered him, and straightway they began to quarrel\namong themselves, filling the woods with a babel of voices. While I\nstood listening to these disputes with a boy’s awe of a man’s quarrel,\nwhat was my astonishment to feel a hand on my shoulder. It was Colonel\nClark’s, and he was not paying the least attention to the dispute.\n\n“Davy,” said he, “you look as if you could make a fire.”\n\n“Yes, sir,” I answered, gasping.\n\n“Well,” said he, “make one.”\n\nI lighted a piece of punk with the flint, and, wrapping it up in some\ndry brush, soon had a blaze started. Looking up, I caught his eye on me\nagain.\n\n“Mrs. McChesney,” said Colonel Clark to Polly Ann, “you look as if you\ncould make johnny-cake. Have you any meal?”\n\n“That I have,” cried Polly Ann, “though it’s fair mouldy. Davy, run and\nfetch it.”\n\nI ran to the pack on the sorrel mare. When I returned Mr. Clark said:--\n\n“That seems a handy boy, Mrs. McChesney.”\n\n“Handy!” cried Polly Ann, “I reckon he’s more than handy. Didn’t he save\nmy life twice on our way out here?”\n\n“And how was that?” said the Colonel.\n\n“Run and fetch some water, Davy,” said Polly Ann, and straightway\nlaunched forth into a vivid description of my exploits, as she mixed\nthe meal. Nay, she went so far as to tell how she came by me. The young\nColonel listened gravely, though with a gleam now and then in his blue\neyes. Leaning on his long rifle, he paid no manner of attention to\nthe angry voices near by,--which conduct to me was little short of the\nmarvellous.\n\n“Now, Davy,” said he, at length, “the rest of your history.”\n\n“There is little of it, sir,” I answered. “I was born in the Yadkin\ncountry, lived alone with my father, who was a Scotchman. He hated a man\nnamed Cameron, took me to Charlestown, and left me with some kin of his\nwho had a place called Temple Bow, and went off to fight Cameron and the\nCherokees.” There I gulped. “He was killed at Cherokee Ford, and--and I\nran away from Temple Bow, and found Polly Ann.”\n\nThis time I caught something of surprise on the Colonel’s face.\n\n“By thunder, Davy,” said he, “but you have a clean gift for brief\nnarrative. Where did you learn it?”\n\n“My father was a gentleman once, and taught me to speak and read,” I\nanswered, as I brought a flat piece of limestone for Polly Ann’s baking.\n\n“And what would you like best to be when you grow up, Davy?” he asked.\n\n“Six feet,” said I, so promptly that he laughed.\n\n“Faith,” said Polly Ann, looking at me comically, “he may be many\nthings, but I’ll warrant he’ll never be that.”\n\nI have often thought since that young Mr. Clark showed much of the\nwisdom of the famous king of Israel on that day. Polly Ann cooked a\npiece of a deer which one of the woodsmen had with him, and the quarrel\ndied of itself when we sat down to this and the johnny-cake. By noon we\nhad taken up the trace for Harrodstown, marching with scouts ahead and\nbehind. Mr. Clark walked mostly alone, seemingly wrapped in thought.\nAt times he had short talks with different men, oftenest--I noted with\npride--with Tom McChesney. And more than once when he halted he called\nme to him, my answers to his questions seeming to amuse him. Indeed, I\nbecame a kind of pet with the backwoodsmen, Cowan often flinging me to\nhis shoulder as he swung along. The pack was taken from the sorrel mare\nand divided among the party, and Polly Ann made to ride that we might\nmove the faster.\n\nIt must have been the next afternoon, about four, that the rough\nstockade of Harrodstown greeted our eyes as we stole cautiously to the\nedge of the forest. And the sight of no roofs and spires could have\nbeen more welcome than that of these logs and cabins, broiling in the\nmidsummer sun. At a little distance from the fort, a silent testimony\nof siege, the stumpy, cleared fields were overgrown with weeds, tall\nand rank, the corn choked. Nearer the stockade, where the keepers of the\nfort might venture out at times, a more orderly growth met the eye. It\nwas young James Ray whom Colonel Clark singled to creep with our message\nto the gates. At six, when the smoke was rising from the stone chimneys\nbehind the palisades, Ray came back to say that all was well. Then we\nwent forward quickly, hands waved a welcome above the logs, the great\nwooden gates swung open, and at last we had reached the haven for which\nwe had suffered so much. Mangy dogs barked at our feet, men and women\nran forward joyfully to seize our hands and greet us.\n\nAnd so we came to Kaintuckee.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. HARRODSTOWN\n\nThe old forts like Harrodstown and Boonesboro and Logan’s at St. Asaph’s\nhave long since passed away. It is many, many years since I lived\nthrough that summer of siege in Harrodstown, the horrors of it are faded\nand dim, the discomforts lost to a boy thrilled with a new experience. I\nhave read in my old age the books of travellers in Kentucky, English and\nFrench, who wrote much of squalor and strife and sin and little of\nthose qualities that go to the conquest of an empire and the making of a\npeople. Perchance my own pages may be colored by gratitude and love for\nthe pioneers amongst whom I found myself, and thankfulness to God that\nwe had reached them alive.\n\nI know not how many had been cooped up in the little fort since the\nearly spring, awaiting the chance to go back to their weed-choked\nclearings. The fort at Harrodstown was like an hundred others I have\nsince seen, but sufficiently surprising to me then. Imagine a great\nparallelogram made of log cabins set end to end, their common outside\nwall being the wall of the fort, and loopholed. At the four corners\nof the parallelogram the cabins jutted out, with ports in the angle in\norder to give a flanking fire in case the savages reached the palisade.\nAnd then there were huge log gates with watch-towers on either side\nwhere sentries sat day and night scanning the forest line. Within the\nfort was a big common dotted with forest trees, where such cattle as\nhad been saved browsed on the scanty grass. There had been but the one\nscrawny horse before our arrival.\n\nAnd the settlers! How shall I describe them as they crowded around us\ninside the gate? Some stared at us with sallow faces and eyes brightened\nby the fever, yet others had the red glow of health. Many of the men\nwore rough beards, unkempt, and yellow, weather-worn hunting shirts,\noften stained with blood. The barefooted women wore sunbonnets and loose\nhomespun gowns, some of linen made from nettles, while the children\nswarmed here and there and everywhere in any costume that chance had\ngiven them. All seemingly talking at once, they plied us with question\nafter question of the trace, the Watauga settlements, the news in the\nCarolinys, and how the war went.\n\n“A lad is it, this one,” said an Irish voice near me, “and a woman!\nThe dear help us, and who’d ‘ave thought to see a woman come over the\nmountain this year! Where did ye find them, Bill Cowan?”\n\n“Near the Crab Orchard, and the lad killed and sculped a six-foot\nbrave.”\n\n“The saints save us! And what ‘ll be his name?”\n\n“Davy,” said my friend.\n\n“Is it Davy? Sure his namesake killed a giant, too.”\n\n“And is he come along, also?” said another. His shy blue eyes and stiff\nblond hair gave him a strange appearance in a hunting shirt.\n\n“Hist to him! Who will ye be talkin’ about, Poulsson? Is it King David\nye mane?”\n\nThere was a roar of laughter, and this was my introduction to Terence\nMcCann and Swein Poulsson. The fort being crowded, we were put into a\ncabin with Terence and Cowan and Cowan’s wife--a tall, gaunt woman with\na sharp tongue and a kind heart--and her four brats, “All hugemsmug\ntogether,” as Cowan said. And that night we supped upon dried buffalo\nmeat and boiled nettle-tops, for of such was the fare in Harrodstown\nthat summer.\n\n“Tom McChesney kept his faith.” One other man was to keep his faith\nwith the little community--George Rogers Clark. And I soon learned that\ntrustworthiness is held in greater esteem in a border community than\nanywhere else. Of course, the love of the frontier was in the grain of\nthese men. But what did they come back to? Day after day would the sun\nrise over the forest and beat down upon the little enclosure in which we\nwere penned. The row of cabins leaning against the stockade marked the\nboundaries of our diminutive world. Beyond them, invisible, lurked a\nrelentless foe. Within, the greater souls alone were calm, and a man’s\nworth was set down to a hair’s breadth. Some were always to be found\nsquatting on their door-steps cursing the hour which had seen them\ndepart for this land; some wrestled and fought on the common, for a fist\nfight with a fair field and no favor was a favorite amusement of the\nbackwoodsmen. My big friend, Cowan, was the champion of these, and often\nof an evening the whole of the inhabitants would gather near the spring\nto see him fight those who had the courage to stand up to him. His\nmuscles were like hickory wood, and I have known a man insensible for\na quarter of an hour after one of his blows. Strangely enough, he never\nfought in anger, and was the first to the spring for a gourd of water\nafter the fight was over. But Tom McChesney was the best wrestler of the\nlot, and could make a wider leap than any other man in Harrodstown.\n\nTom’s reputation did not end there, for he became one of the two\nbread-winners of the station. I would better have said meatwinners. Woe\nbe to the incautious who, lulled by a week of fancied security, ventured\nout into the dishevelled field for a little food! In the early days of\nthe siege man after man had gone forth for game, never to return. Until\nTom came, one only had been successful,--that lad of seventeen, whose\nachievements were the envy of my boyish soul, James Ray. He slept in the\ncabin next to Cowan’s, and long before the dawn had revealed the forest\nline had been wont to steal out of the gates on the one scrawny horse\nthe Indians had left them, gain the Salt River, and make his way thence\nthrough the water to some distant place where the listening savages\ncould not hear his shot. And now Tom took his turn. Often did I sit with\nPolly Ann till midnight in the sentry’s tower, straining my ears for the\nowl’s hoot that warned us of his coming. Sometimes he was empty-handed,\nbut sometimes a deer hung limp and black across his saddle, or a pair of\nturkeys swung from his shoulder.\n\n“Arrah, darlin’,” said Terence to Polly Ann, “‘tis yer husband and James\nis the jools av the fort. Sure I niver loved me father as I do thim.”\n\nI would have given kingdoms in those days to have been seventeen and\nJames Ray. When he was in the fort I dogged his footsteps, and listened\nwith a painful yearning to the stories of his escapes from the roving\nbands. And as many a character is watered in its growth by hero-worship,\nso my own grew firmer in the contemplation of Ray’s resourcefulness. My\nstrange life had far removed me from lads of my own age, and he took a\nfancy to me, perhaps because of the very persistence of my devotion to\nhim. I cleaned his gun, filled his powder flask, and ran to do his every\nbidding.\n\nI used in the hot summer days to lie under the elm tree and listen to\nthe settlers’ talk about a man named Henderson, who had bought a great\npart of Kentucky from the Indians, and had gone out with Boone to found\nBoonesboro some two years before. They spoke of much that I did not\nunderstand concerning the discountenance by Virginia of these claims,\nspeculating as to whether Henderson’s grants were good. For some of\nthem held these grants, and others Virginia grants--a fruitful source\nof quarrel between them. Some spoke, too, of Washington and his ragged\nsoldiers going up and down the old colonies and fighting for a freedom\nwhich there seemed little chance of getting. But their anger seemed\nto blaze most fiercely when they spoke of a mysterious British general\nnamed Hamilton, whom they called “the ha’r buyer,” and who from his\nstronghold in the north country across the great Ohio sent down these\nhordes of savages to harry us. I learned to hate Hamilton with the rest,\nand pictured him with the visage of a fiend. We laid at his door every\noutrage that had happened at the three stations, and put upon him\nthe blood of those who had been carried off to torture in the Indian\nvillages of the northern forests. And when--amidst great excitement--a\nspent runner would arrive from Boonesboro or St. Asaph’s and beg Mr.\nClark for a squad, it was commonly with the first breath that came into\nhis body that he cursed Hamilton.\n\nSo the summer wore away, while we lived from hand to mouth on such\nscanty fare as the two of them shot and what we could venture to gather\nin the unkempt fields near the gates. A winter of famine lurked ahead,\nand men were goaded near to madness at the thought of clearings made and\ncorn planted in the spring within reach of their hands, as it were, and\nthey might not harvest it. At length, when a fortnight had passed, and\nTom and Ray had gone forth day after day without sight or fresh sign of\nIndians, the weight lifted from our hearts. There were many things\nthat might yet be planted and come to maturity before the late Kentucky\nfrosts.\n\nThe pressure within the fort, like a flood, opened the gates of it,\ndespite the sturdily disapproving figure of a young man who stood silent\nunder the sentry box, leaning on his Deckard. He was Colonel George\nRogers Clark,¹ Commander-in-chief of the backwoodsmen of Kentucky, whose\npower was reënforced by that strange thing called an education. It was\nthis, no doubt, gave him command of words when he chose to use them.\n¹ It appears that Mr. Clark had not yet received the title of Colonel,\nthough he held command.--Editor.\n\n“Faith,” said Terence, as we passed him, “‘tis a foine man he is, and\na gintleman born. Wasn’t it him gathered the Convintion here in\nHarrodstown last year that chose him and another to go to the Virginia\nlegislatoor? And him but a lad, ye might say. The divil fly away wid\nhis caution! Sure the redskins is as toired as us, and gone home to the\nwives and childher, bad cess to thim.”\n\nAnd so the first day the gates were opened we went into the fields a\nlittle way; and the next day a little farther. They had once seemed to\nme an unexplored and forbidden country as I searched them with my eyes\nfrom the sentry boxes. And yet I felt a shame to go with Polly Ann and\nMrs. Cowan and the women while James Ray and Tom sat with the guard of\nmen between us and the forest line. Like a child on a holiday, Polly\nAnn ran hither and thither among the stalks, her black hair flying and a\nsong on her lips.\n\n“Soon we’ll be having a little home of our own, Davy,” she cried; “Tom\nhas the place chose on a knoll by the river, and the land is rich with\nhickory and pawpaw. I reckon we may be going there next week.”\n\nCaution being born into me with all the strength of a vice, I said\nnothing. Whereupon she seized me in her strong hands and shook me.\n\n“Ye little imp!” said she, while the women paused in their work to laugh\nat us.\n\n“The boy is right, Polly Ann,” said Mrs. Harrod, “and he’s got more\nsense than most of the men in the fort.”\n\n“Ay, that he has,” the gaunt Mrs. Cowan put in, eying me fiercely, while\nshe gave one of her own offsprings a slap that sent him spinning.\n\nWhatever Polly Ann might have said would have been to the point, but it\nwas lost, for just then the sound of a shot came down the wind, and a\nhalf a score of women stampeded through the stalks, carrying me down\nlike a reed before them. When I staggered to my feet Polly Ann and Mrs.\nCowan and Mrs. Harrod were standing alone. For there was little of fear\nin those three.\n\n“Shucks!” said Mrs. Cowan, “I reckon it’s that Jim Ray shooting at a\nmark,” and she began to pick nettles again.\n\n“Vimmen is a shy critter,” remarked Swein Poulsson, coming up. I had a\nshrewd notion that he had run with the others.\n\n“Wimmen!” Mrs. Cowan fairly roared. “Wimmen! Tell us how ye went in\nMarch with the boys to fight the varmints at the Sugar Orchard, Swein!”\n\nWe all laughed, for we loved him none the less. His little blue eyes\nwere perfectly solemn as he answered:--\n\n“Ve send you fight Injuns mit your tongue, Mrs. Cowan. Then we haf no\nmore troubles.”\n\n“Land of Canaan!” cried she, “I reckon I could do more harm with it than\nyou with a gun.”\n\nThere were many such false alarms in the bright days following, and\nnever a bullet sped from the shadow of the forest. Each day we went\nfarther afield, and each night trooped merrily in through the gates with\nhopes of homes and clearings rising in our hearts--until the motionless\nfigure of the young Virginian met our eye. It was then that men began\nto scoff at him behind his back, though some spoke with sufficient\nbackwoods bluntness to his face. And yet he gave no sign of anger or\nimpatience. Not so the other leaders. No sooner did the danger seem past\nthan bitter strife sprang up within the walls. Even the two captains\nwere mortal enemies. One was Harrod, a tall, spare, dark-haired man of\ngreat endurance,--a type of the best that conquered the land for the\nnation; the other, that Hugh McGary of whom I have spoken, coarse and\nbrutal, if you like, but fearless and a leader of men withal.\n\nA certain Sunday morning, I remember, broke with a cloud-flecked sky,\nand as we were preparing to go afield with such ploughs as could be got\ntogether (we were to sow turnips) the loud sounds of a quarrel came\nfrom the elm at the spring. With one accord men and women and children\nflocked thither, and as we ran we heard McGary’s voice above the rest.\nWorming my way, boylike, through the crowd, I came upon McGary and\nHarrod glaring at each other in the centre of it.\n\n“By Job! there’s no devil if I’ll stand back from my clearing and waste\nthe rest of the summer for the fears of a pack of cowards. I’ll take\na posse and march to Shawanee Springs this day, and see any man a fair\nfight that tries to stop me.”\n\n“And who’s in command here?” demanded Harrod.\n\n“I am, for one,” said McGary, with an oath, “and my corn’s on the ear.\nI’ve held back long enough, I tell you, and I’ll starve this winter for\nyou nor any one else.”\n\nHarrod turned.\n\n“Where’s Clark?” he said to Bowman.\n\n“Clark!” roared McGary, “Clark be d--d. Ye’d think he was a woman.”\n He strode up to Harrod until their faces almost touched, and his voice\nshook with the intensity of his anger. “By G--d, you nor Clark nor any\none else will stop me, I say!” He swung around and faced the people.\n“Come on, boys! We’ll fetch that corn, or know the reason why.”\n\nA responding murmur showed that the bulk of them were with him. Weary of\nthe pent-up life, longing for action, and starved for a good meal, the\nanger of his many followers against Clark and Harrod was nigh as great\nas his. He started roughly to shoulder his way out, and whether from\naccident or design Captain Harrod slipped in front of him, I never knew.\nThe thing that followed happened quickly as the catching of my breath. I\nsaw McGary powdering his pan, and Harrod his, and felt the crowd giving\nback like buffalo. All at once the circle had vanished, and the two men\nwere standing not five paces apart with their rifles clutched across\ntheir bodies, each watching, catlike, for the other to level. It was\na cry that startled us--and them. There was a vision of a woman flying\nacross the common, and we saw the dauntless Mrs. Harrod snatching\nher husband’s gun from his resisting hands. So she saved his life and\nMcGary’s.\n\nAt this point Colonel Clark was seen coming from the gate. When he got\nto Harrod and McGary the quarrel blazed up again, but now it was between\nthe three of them, and Clark took Harrod’s rifle from Mrs. Harrod and\nheld it. However, it was presently decided that McGary should wait one\nmore day before going to his clearing; whereupon the gates were opened,\nthe picked men going ahead to take station as a guard, and soon we were\nhard at work, ploughing here and mowing there, and in another place\nputting seed in the ground: in the cheer of the work hardships were\nforgotten, and we paused now and again to laugh at some sally of\nTerence McCann’s or odd word of Swein Poulsson’s. As the day wore on\nto afternoon a blue haze--harbinger of autumn--settled over fort and\nforest. Bees hummed in the air as they searched hither and thither\namongst the flowers, or shot straight as a bullet for a distant hive.\nBut presently a rifle cracked, and we raised our heads.\n\n“Hist!” said Terence, “the bhoys on watch is that warlike! Whin there’s\nno redskins to kill they must be wastin’ good powdher on a three.”\n\nI leaped upon a stump and scanned the line of sentries between us\nand the woods; only their heads and shoulders appeared above the rank\ngrowth. I saw them looking from one to another questioningly, some\nshouting words I could not hear. Then I saw some running; and next, as\nI stood there wondering, came another crack, and then a volley like the\nnoise of a great fire licking into dry wood, and things that were\nnot bees humming round about. A distant man in a yellow hunting shirt\nstumbled, and was drowned in the tangle as in water. Around me men\ndropped plough-handles and women baskets, and as we ran our legs grew\nnumb and our bodies cold at a sound which had haunted us in dreams by\nnight--the war-whoop. The deep and guttural song of it rose and fell\nwith a horrid fierceness. An agonized voice was in my ears, and I\nhalted, ashamed. It was Polly Ann’s.\n\n“Davy!” she cried, “Davy, have ye seen Tom?”\n\nTwo men dashed by. I seized one by the fringe of his shirt, and he flung\nme from my feet. The other leaped me as I knelt.\n\n“Run, ye fools!” he shouted. But we stood still, with yearning eyes\nstaring back through the frantic forms for a sight of Tom’s.\n\n“I’ll go back!” I cried, “I’ll go back for him. Do you run to the fort.”\n For suddenly I seemed to forget my fear, nor did even the hideous notes\nof the scalp halloo disturb me. Before Polly Ann could catch me I\nhad turned and started, stumbled,--I thought on a stump,--and fallen\nheadlong among the nettles with a stinging pain in my leg. Staggering to\nmy feet, I tried to run on, fell again, and putting down my hand found\nit smeared with blood. A man came by, paused an instant while his eye\ncaught me, and ran on again. I shall remember his face and name to my\ndying day; but there is no reason to put it down here. In a few seconds’\nspace as I lay I suffered all the pains of captivity and of death by\ntorture, that cry of savage man an hundred times more frightful than\nsavage beast sounding in my ears, and plainly nearer now by half the\nfirst distance. Nearer, and nearer yet--and then I heard my name called.\nI was lifted from the ground, and found myself in the lithe arms of\nPolly Ann.\n\n“Set me down!” I screamed, “set me down!” and must have added some of\nthe curses I had heard in the fort. But she clutched me tightly (God\nbless the memory of those frontier women!), and flew like a deer toward\nthe gates. Over her shoulder I glanced back. A spare three hundred yards\naway in a ragged line a hundred red devils were bounding after us with\nfeathers flying and mouths open as they yelled. Again I cried to her\nto set me down; but though her heart beat faster and her breath came\nshorter, she held me the tighter. Second by second they gained on\nus, relentlessly. Were we near the fort? Hoarse shouts answered the\nquestion, but they seemed distant--too distant. The savages were\ngaining, and Polly Ann’s breath quicker still. She staggered, but the\nbrave soul had no thought of faltering. I had a sight of a man on a\nplough horse with dangling harness coming up from somewhere, of the man\nleaping off, of ourselves being pitched on the animal’s bony back\nand clinging there at the gallop, the man running at the side. Shots\nwhistled over our heads, and here was the brown fort. Its big gates\nswung together as we dashed through the narrowed opening. Then, as he\nlifted us off, I knew that the man who had saved us was Tom himself. The\ngates closed with a bang, and a patter of bullets beat against them like\nrain.\n\nThrough the shouting and confusion came a cry in a voice I knew, now\npleading, now commanding.\n\n“Open, open! For God’s sake open!”\n\n“It’s Ray! Open for Ray! Ray’s out!”\n\nSome were seizing the bar to thrust it back when the heavy figure of\nMcGary crushed into the crowd beside it.\n\n“By Job, I’ll shoot the man that touches it!” he shouted, as he tore\nthem away. But the sturdiest of them went again to it, and cursed him.\nAnd while they fought backward and forward, the lad’s mother, Mrs. Ray,\ncried out to them to open in tones to rend their hearts. But McGary had\ngained the bar and swore (perhaps wisely) that he would not sacrifice\nthe station for one man. Where was Ray?\n\nWhere was Ray, indeed? It seemed as if no man might live in the hellish\nstorm that raged without the walls: as if the very impetus of hate and\nfury would carry the savages over the stockade to murder us. Into the\nturmoil at the gate came Colonel Clark, sending the disputants this way\nand that to defend the fort, McGary to command one quarter, Harrod and\nBowman another, and every man that could be found to a loophole, while\nMrs. Ray continued to run up and down, wringing her hands, now facing\none man, now another. Some of her words came to me, shrilly, above the\nnoise.\n\n“He fed you--he fed you. Oh, my God, and you are grateful--grateful!\nWhen you were starving he risked his life--”\n\nTorn by anxiety for my friend, I dragged myself into the nearest cabin,\nand a man was fighting there in the half-light at the port. The huge\nfigure I knew to be my friend Cowan’s, and when he drew back to load I\nseized his arm, shouting Ray’s name. Although the lead was pattering\non the other side of the logs, Cowan lifted me to the port. And there,\nstretched on the ground behind a stump, within twenty feet of the walls,\nwas James. Even as I looked the puffs of dust at his side showed that\nthe savages knew his refuge. I saw him level and fire, and then Bill\nCowan set me down and began to ram in a charge with tremendous energy.\n\nWas there no way to save Ray? I stood turning this problem in my mind,\nsubconsciously aware of Cowan’s movements: of his yells when he thought\nhe had made a shot, when Polly Ann appeared at the doorway. Darting in,\nshe fairly hauled me to the shake-down in the far corner.\n\n“Will ye bleed to death, Davy?” she cried, as she slipped off my legging\nand bent over the wound. Her eye lighting on a gourdful of water on the\npuncheon table, she tore a strip from her dress and washed and bound me\ndeftly. The bullet was in the flesh, and gave me no great pain.\n\n“Lie there, ye imp!” she commanded, when she had finished.\n\n“Some one’s under the bed,” said I, for I had heard a movement.\n\nIn an instant we were down on our knees on the hard dirt floor, and\nthere was a man’s foot in a moccasin! We both grabbed it and pulled,\nbringing to life a person with little blue eyes and stiff blond hair.\n\n“Swein Poulsson!” exclaimed Polly Ann, giving him an involuntary kick,\n“may the devil give ye shame!”\n\nSwein Poulsson rose to a sitting position and clasped his knees in his\nhands.\n\n“I haf one great fright,” said he.\n\n“Send him into the common with the women in yere place, Mis’ McChesney,”\n growled Cowan, who was loading.\n\n“By tam!” said Swein Poulsson, leaping to his feet, “I vill stay here\nund fight. I am prave once again.” Stooping down, he searched under the\nbed, pulled out his rifle, powdered the pan, and flying to the other\nport, fired. At that Cowan left his post and snatched the rifle from\nPoulsson’s hands.\n\n“Ye’re but wasting powder,” he cried angrily.\n\n“Then, by tam, I am as vell under the bed,” said Poulsson. “Vat can I\ndo?”\n\nI had it.\n\n“Dig!” I shouted; and seizing the astonished Cowan’s tomahawk from his\nbelt I set to work furiously chopping at the dirt beneath the log wall.\n“Dig, so that James can get under.”\n\nCowan gave me the one look, swore a mighty oath, and leaping to the port\nshouted to Ray in a thundering voice what we were doing.\n\n“Dig!” roared Cowan. “Dig, for the love of God, for he can’t hear me.”\n\nThe three of us set to work with all our might, Poulsson making great\nholes in the ground at every stroke, Polly Ann scraping at the dirt with\nthe gourd. Two feet below the surface we struck the edge of the lowest\nlog, and then it was Poulsson who got into the hole with his hunting\nknife--perspiring, muttering to himself, working as one possessed with\na fury, while we scraped out the dirt from under him. At length, after\nwhat seemed an age of staring at his legs, the ground caved on him,\nand he would have smothered if we had not dragged him out by the heels,\nsputtering and all powdered brown. But there was the daylight under the\nlog.\n\nAgain Cowan shouted at Ray, and again, but he did not understand. It was\nthen the miracle happened. I have seen brave men and cowards since, and\nI am as far as ever from distinguishing them. Before we knew it Poulsson\nwas in the hole once more--had wriggled out of it on the other side, and\nwas squirming in a hail of bullets towards Ray. There was a full minute\nof suspense--perhaps two--during which the very rifles of the fort were\nsilent (though the popping in the weeds was redoubled), and then the\nbarrel of a Deckard was poked through the hole. After it came James\nRay himself, and lastly Poulsson, and a great shout went out from the\nloopholes and was taken up by the women in the common.\n\nSwein Poulsson had become a hero, nor was he willing to lose any of the\nglamour which was a hero’s right. As the Indians’ fire slackened, he\nwent from cabin to cabin, and if its occupants failed to mention the\nexploit (some did fail so to do, out of mischief), Swein would say:--\n\n“You did not see me safe James, no? I vill tell you joost how.”\n\nIt never leaked out that Swein was first of all under the bed, for Polly\nAnn and Bill Cowan and myself swore to keep the secret. But they\ntold how I had thought of digging the hole under the logs--a happy\ncircumstance which got me a reputation for wisdom beyond my years. There\nwas a certain Scotchman at Harrodstown called McAndrew, and it was\nhe gave me the nickname “Canny Davy,” and I grew to have a sort of\nprecocious fame in the station. Often Captain Harrod or Bowman or some\nof the others would pause in their arguments and say gravely, “What does\nDavy think of it?” This was not good for a boy, and the wonder of it is\nthat it did not make me altogether insupportable. One effect it had on\nme--to make me long even more earnestly to be a man.\n\nThe impulse of my reputation led me farther. A fortnight of more\ninactivity followed, and then we ventured out into the fields once more.\nBut I went with the guard this time, not with the women,--thanks to a\nwhim the men had for humoring me.\n\n“Arrah, and beant he a man all but two feet,” said Terence, “wid more\nbrain than me an’ Bill Cowan and Poulsson togither? ‘Tis a fox’s nose\nDavy has for the divils, Bill. Sure he can smell thim the same as you\nan’ me kin see the red paint on their faces.”\n\n“I reckon that’s true,” said Bill Cowan, with solemnity, and so he\ncarried me off.\n\nAt length the cattle were turned out to browse greedily through the\nclearing, while we lay in the woods by the forest and listened to the\nsound of their bells, but when they strayed too far, I was often sent to\ndrive them back. Once when this happened I followed them to the shade at\nthe edge of the woods, for it was noon, and the sun beat down fiercely.\nAnd there I sat for some time watching them as they lashed their sides\nwith their tails and pawed the ground, for experience is a good master.\nWhether or not the flies were all that troubled them I could not tell,\nand no sound save the tinkle of their bells broke the noonday stillness.\nMaking a circle I drove them back toward the fort, much troubled in\nmind. I told Cowan, but he laughed and said it was the flies. Yet I was\nnot satisfied, and finally stole back again to the place where I\nhad found them. I sat a long time hidden at the edge of the forest,\nlistening until my imagination tricked me into hearing those noises\nwhich I feared and yet longed for. Trembling, I stole a little farther\nin the shade of the woods, and then a little farther still. The leaves\nrustled in the summer’s breeze, patches of sunlight flickered on the\nmould, the birds twittered, and the squirrels scolded. A chipmunk\nfrightened me as he flew chattering along a log. And yet I went on. I\ncame to the creek as it flowed silently in the shade, stepped in, and\nmade my way slowly down it, I know not how far, walking in the water, my\neye alert to every movement about me. At length I stopped and caught my\nbreath. Before me, in a glade opening out under great trees, what seemed\na myriad of forked sticks were piled against one another, three by\nthree, and it struck me all in a heap that I had come upon a great\nencampment. But the skeletons of the pyramid tents alone remained. Where\nwere the skins? Was the camp deserted?\n\nFor a while I stared through the brier leaves, then I took a venture,\npushed on, and found myself in the midst of the place. It must have held\nnear a thousand warriors. All about me were gray heaps of ashes, and\nbones of deer and elk and buffalo scattered, some picked clean,\nsome with the meat and hide sticking to them. Impelled by a strong\nfascination, I went hither and thither until a sound brought me to a\nstand--the echoing crack of a distant rifle. On the heels of it came\nanother, then several together, and a faint shouting borne on the light\nwind. Terrorized, I sought for shelter. A pile of brush underlain by\nashes was by, and I crept into that. The sounds continued, but seemed to\ncome no nearer, and my courage returning, I got out again and ran wildly\nthrough the camp toward the briers on the creek, expecting every moment\nto be tumbled headlong by a bullet. And when I reached the briers, what\nbetween panting and the thumping of my heart I could for a few moments\nhear nothing. Then I ran on again up the creek, heedless of cover,\nstumbling over logs and trailing vines, when all at once a dozen bronze\nforms glided with the speed of deer across my path ahead. They splashed\nover the creek and were gone. Bewildered with fear, I dropped under a\nfallen tree. Shouts were in my ears, and the noise of men running. I\nstood up, and there, not twenty paces away, was Colonel Clark himself\nrushing toward me. He halted with a cry, raised his rifle, and dropped\nit at the sight of my queer little figure covered with ashes.\n\n“My God!” he cried, “it’s Davy.”\n\n“They crossed the creek,” I shouted, pointing the way, “they crossed the\ncreek, some twelve of them.”\n\n“Ay,” he said, staring at me, and by this time the rest of the guard\nwere come up. They too stared, with different exclamations on their\nlips,--Cowan and Bowman and Tom McChesney and Terence McCann in front.\n\n“And there’s a great camp below,” I went on, “deserted, where a thousand\nmen have been.”\n\n“A camp--deserted?” said Clark, quickly.\n\n“Yes,” I said, “yes.” But he had already started forward and seized me\nby the arm.\n\n“Lead on,” he cried, “show it to us.” He went ahead with me, travelling\nso fast that I must needs run to keep up, and fairly lifting me over the\nlogs. But when we came in sight of the place he darted forward alone\nand went through it like a hound on the trail. The others followed\nhim, crying out at the size of the place and poking among the ashes. At\nlength they all took up the trail for a way down the creek. Presently\nClark called a halt.\n\n“I reckon that they’ve made for the Ohio,” he said. And at this judgment\nfrom him the guard gave a cheer that might almost have been heard in\nthe fields around the fort. The terror that had hovered over us all that\nlong summer was lifted at last.\n\nYou may be sure that Cowan carried me back to the station. “To think it\nwas Davy that found it!” he cried again and again, “to think it was Davy\nfound it!”\n\n“And wasn’t it me that said he could smell the divils,” said Terence, as\nhe circled around us in a mimic war dance. And when from the fort they\nsaw us coming across the fields they opened the gates in astonishment,\nand on hearing the news gave themselves over to the wildest rejoicing.\nFor the backwoodsmen were children of nature. Bill Cowan ran for the\nfiddle which he had carried so carefully over the mountain, and that\nnight we had jigs and reels on the common while the big fellow played\n“Billy of the Wild Woods” and “Jump Juba,” with all his might, and\nthe pine knots threw their fitful, red light on the wild scenes of\nmerriment. I must have cut a queer little figure as I sat between Cowan\nand Tom watching the dance, for presently Colonel Clark came up to us,\nlaughing in his quiet way.\n\n“Davy,” said he, “there is another great man here who would like to\nsee you,” and led me away wondering. I went with him toward the gate,\nburning all over with pride at this attention, and beside a torch there\na broad-shouldered figure was standing, at sight of whom I had a start\nof remembrance.\n\n“Do you know who that is, Davy?” said Colonel Clark.\n\n“It’s Mr. Daniel Boone,” said I.\n\n“By thunder,” said Clark, “I believe the boy is a wizard,” while Mr.\nBoone’s broad mouth was creased into a smile, and there was a trace of\nastonishment, too, in his kindly eye.\n\n“Mr. Boone came to my father’s cabin on the Yadkin once,” I said; “he\ntaught me to skin a deer.”\n\n“Ay, that I did,” exclaimed Mr. Boone, “and I said ye’d make a woodsman\nsometime.”\n\nMr. Boone, it seemed, had come over from Boonesboro to consult with\nColonel Clark on certain matters, and had but just arrived. But so\nmodest was he that he would not let it be known that he was in the\nstation, for fear of interrupting the pleasure. He was much the same as\nI had known him, only grown older and his reputation now increased to\nvastness. He and Clark sat on a door log talking for a long time\non Kentucky matters, the strength of the forts, the prospect of new\nsettlers that autumn, of the British policy, and finally of a journey\nwhich Colonel Clark was soon to make back to Virginia across the\nmountains. They seemed not to mind my presence. At length Colonel Clark\nturned to me with that quiet, jocose way he had when relaxed.\n\n“Davy,” said he, “we’ll see how much of a general you are. What would\nyou do if a scoundrel named Hamilton far away at Detroit was bribing all\nthe redskins he could find north of the Ohio to come down and scalp your\nmen?”\n\n“I’d go for Hamilton,” I answered.\n\n“By God!” exclaimed Clark, striking Mr. Boone on the knee, “that’s what\nI’d do.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. FRAGMENTARY\n\nMr. Boone’s visit lasted but a day. I was a great deal with Colonel\nClark in the few weeks that followed before his departure for Virginia.\nHe held himself a little aloof (as a leader should) from the captains\nin the station, without seeming to offend them. But he had a fancy for\nJames Ray and for me, and he often took me into the woods with him by\nday, and talked with me of an evening.\n\n“I’m going away to Virginia, Davy,” he said; “will you not go with me?\nWe’ll see Williamsburg, and come back in the spring, and I’ll have you a\nlittle rifle made.”\n\nMy look must have been wistful.\n\n“I can’t leave Polly Ann and Tom,” I answered.\n\n“Well,” he said, “I like that. Faith to your friends is a big equipment\nfor life.”\n\n“But why are you going?” I asked.\n\n“Because I love Kentucky best of all things in the world,” he answered,\nsmiling.\n\n“And what are you going to do?” I insisted.\n\n“Ah,” he said, “that I can’t tell even to you.”\n\n“To catch Hamilton?” I ventured at random.\n\nHe looked at me queerly.\n\n“Would you go along, Davy?” said he, laughing now.\n\n“Would you take Tom?”\n\n“Among the first,” answered Colonel Clark, heartily.\n\nWe were seated under the elm near the spring, and at that instant I\nsaw Tom coming toward us. I jumped up, thinking to please him by this\nintelligence, when Colonel Clark pulled me down again.\n\n“Davy,” said he, almost roughly, I thought, “remember that we have been\njoking. Do you understand?--joking. You have a tongue in your mouth,\nbut sense enough in your head, I believe, to hold it.” He turned to Tom.\n“McChesney, this is a queer lad you brought us,” said he.\n\n“He’s a little deevil,” agreed Tom, for that had become a formula with\nhim.\n\nIt was all very mysterious to me, and I lay awake many a night with\ncuriosity, trying to solve a puzzle that was none of my business. And\none day, to cap the matter, two woodsmen arrived at Harrodstown with\nclothes frayed and bodies lean from a long journey. Not one of the\nhundred questions with which they were beset would they answer, nor\nsay where they had been or why, save that they had carried out certain\norders of Clark, who was locked up with them in a cabin for several\nhours.\n\nThe first of October, the day of Colonel Clark’s departure, dawned crisp\nand clear. He was to take with him the disheartened and the cowed, the\nweaklings who loved neither work nor exposure nor danger. And before he\nset out of the gate he made a little speech to the assembled people.\n\n“My friends,” he said, “you know me. I put the interests of Kentucky\nbefore my own. Last year when I left to represent her at Williamsburg\nthere were some who said I would desert her. It was for her sake I made\nthat journey, suffered the tortures of hell from scalded feet, was near\nto dying in the mountains. It was for her sake that I importuned the\ngovernor and council for powder and lead, and when they refused it I\nsaid to them, ‘Gentlemen, a country that is not worth defending is not\nworth claiming.’”\n\nAt these words the settlers gave a great shout, waving their coonskin\nhats in the air.\n\n“Ay, that ye did,” cried Bill Cowan, “and got the amminition.”\n\n“I made that journey for her sake, I say,” Colonel Clark continued, “and\neven so I am making this one. I pray you trust me, and God bless and\nkeep you while I am gone.”\n\nHe did not forget to speak to me as he walked between our lines, and\ntold me to be a good boy and that he would see me in the spring. Some\nof the women shed tears as he passed through the gate, and many of us\nclimbed to sentry box and cabin roof that we might see the last of the\nlittle company wending its way across the fields. A motley company it\nwas, the refuse of the station, headed by its cherished captain. So they\nstarted back over the weary road that led to that now far-away land of\ncivilization and safety.\n\nDuring the balmy Indian summer, when the sharper lines of nature are\nsoftened by the haze, some came to us from across the mountains to make\nup for the deserters. From time to time a little group would straggle to\nthe gates of the station, weary and footsore, but overjoyed at the sight\nof white faces again: the fathers walking ahead with watchful eyes, the\nwomen and older children driving the horses, and the babies slung to the\npack in hickory withes. Nay, some of our best citizens came to Kentucky\nswinging to the tail of a patient animal. The Indians were still abroad,\nand in small war parties darted hither and thither with incredible\nswiftness. And at night we would gather at the fire around our new\nemigrants to listen to the stories they had to tell,--familiar stories\nto all of us. Sometimes it had been the gobble of a wild turkey that had\nlured to danger, again a wood-owl had cried strangely in the night.\n\nWinter came, and passed--somehow. I cannot dwell here on the tediousness\nof it, and the one bright spot it has left in my memory concerns Polly\nAnn. Did man, woman, or child fall sick, it was Polly Ann who nursed\nthem. She had by nature the God-given gift of healing, knew by heart all\nthe simple remedies that backwoods lore had inherited from the north of\nIreland or borrowed from the Indians. Her sympathy and loving-kindness\ndid more than these, her never tiring and ever cheerful watchfulness.\nShe was deft, too, was Polly Ann, and spun from nettle bark many a cut\nof linen that could scarce be told from flax. Before the sap began to\nrun again in the maples there was not a soul in Harrodstown who did not\nlove her, and I truly believe that most of them would have risked their\nlives to do her bidding.\n\nThen came the sugaring, the warm days and the freezing nights when\nthe earth stirs in her sleep and the taps drip from red sunrise to red\nsunset. Old and young went to the camps, the women and children boiling\nand graining, the squads of men posted in guards round about. And after\nthat the days flew so quickly that it seemed as if the woods had burst\nsuddenly into white flower, and it was spring again. And then--a joy\nto be long remembered--I went on a hunting trip with Tom and Cowan\nand three others where the Kentucky tumbles between its darkly wooded\ncliffs. And other wonders of that strange land I saw then for the first\ntime: great licks, trampled down for acres by the wild herds, where\nthe salt water oozes out of the hoofprints. On the edge of one of these\nlicks we paused and stared breathless at giant bones sticking here\nand there in the black mud, and great skulls of fearful beasts\nhalf-embedded. This was called the Big Bone Lick, and some travellers\nthat went before us had made their tents with the thighs of these\nmonsters of a past age.\n\nA danger past is oft a danger forgotten. Men went out to build the homes\nof which they had dreamed through the long winter. Axes rang amidst\nthe white dogwoods and the crabs and redbuds, and there were riotous\nlog-raisings in the clearings. But I think the building of Tom’s house\nwas the most joyous occasion of all, and for none in the settlement\nwould men work more willingly than for him and Polly Ann. The cabin went\nup as if by magic. It stood on a rise upon the bank of the river in a\ngrove of oaks and hickories, with a big persimmon tree in front of the\ndoor. It was in the shade of this tree that Polly Ann sat watching Tom\nand me through the mild spring days as we barked the roof, and none ever\nfelt greater joy and pride in a home than she. We had our first supper\non a wide puncheon under the persimmon tree on the few pewter plates\nwe had fetched across the mountain, the blue smoke from our own hearth\nrising in the valley until the cold night air spread it out in a line\nabove us, while the horses grazed at the river’s edge.\n\nAfter that we went to ploughing, an occupation which Tom fancied but\nlittle, for he loved the life of a hunter best of all. But there was\ncorn to be raised and fodder for the horses, and a truck-patch to be\ncleared near the house.\n\nOne day a great event happened,--and after the manner of many great\nevents, it began in mystery. Leaping on the roan mare, I was riding like\nmad for Harrodstown to fetch Mrs. Cowan. And she, when she heard the\nsummons, abandoned a turkey on the spit, pitched her brats out of the\ndoor, seized the mare, and dashing through the gates at a gallop left\nme to make my way back afoot. Scenting a sensation, I hurried along the\nwooded trace at a dog trot, and when I came in sight of the cabin there\nwas Mrs. Cowan sitting on the step, holding in her long but motherly\narms something bundled up in nettle linen, while Tom stood sheepishly\nby, staring at it.\n\n“Shucks,” Mrs. Cowan was saying loudly, “I reckon ye’re as little use\nto-day as Swein Poulsson,--standin’ there on one foot. Ye anger me--just\ngrinning at it like a fool--and yer own doin’. Have ye forgot how to\ntalk?”\n\nTom grinned the more, but was saved the effort of a reply by a loud\nnoise from the bundle.\n\n“Here’s another,” cried Mrs. Cowan to me. “Ye needn’t act as if it was\nan animal. Faith, yereself was like that once, all red an’ crinkled. But\nI warrant ye didn’t have the heft,” and she lifted it, judicially. “A\ngrand baby,” attacking Tom again, “and ye’re no more worthy to be his\nfather than Davy here.”\n\nThen I heard a voice calling me, and pushing past Mrs. Cowan, I ran into\nthe cabin. Polly Ann lay on the log bedstead, and she turned to mine a\nface radiant with a happiness I had not imagined.\n\n“Oh, Davy, have ye seen him? Have ye seen little Tom? Davy, I reckon\nI’ll never be so happy again. Fetch him here, Mrs. Cowan.”\n\nMrs. Cowan, with a glance of contempt at Tom and me, put the bundle\ntenderly down on the coarse brown sheet beside her.\n\nPoor little Tom! Only the first fortnight of his existence was spent in\npeace. I have a pathetic memory of it all--of our little home, of our\nhopes for it, of our days of labor and nights of planning to make it\ncomplete. And then, one morning when the three of us were turning over\nthe black loam in the patch, while the baby slept peacefully in the\nshade, a sound came to our ears that made us pause and listen with bated\nbreath. It was the sound of many guns, muffled in the distant forest.\nWith a cry Polly Ann flew to the hickory cradle under the tree, Tom\nsprang for the rifle that was never far from his side, while with a\nkind of instinct I ran to catch the spancelled horses by the river. In\nsilence and sorrow we fled through the tall cane, nor dared to take\none last look at the cabin, or the fields lying black in the spring\nsunlight. The shots had ceased, but ere we had reached the little\nclearing McCann had made they began again, though as distant as before.\nTom went ahead, while I led the mare and Polly Ann clutched the child to\nher breast. But when we came in sight of the fort across the clearings\nthe gates were closed. There was nothing to do but cower in the thicket,\nlistening while the battle went on afar, Polly Ann trying to still the\ncries of the child, lest they should bring death upon us. At length the\nshooting ceased; stillness reigned; then came a faint halloo, and out of\nthe forest beyond us a man rode, waving his hat at the fort. After him\ncame others. The gates opened, and we rushed pell-mell across the fields\nto safety.\n\nThe Indians had shot at a party shelling corn at Captain Bowman’s\nplantation, and killed two, while the others had taken refuge in the\ncrib. Fired at from every brake, James Ray had ridden to Harrodstown\nfor succor, and the savages had been beaten off. But only the foolhardy\nreturned to their clearings now. We were on the edge of another dreaded\nsummer of siege, the prospect of banishment from the homes we could\nalmost see, staring us in the face, and the labors of the spring lost\nagain. There was bitter talk within the gates that night, and many\ndeclared angrily that Colonel Clark had abandoned us. But I remembered\nwhat he had said, and had faith in him.\n\nIt was that very night, too, I sat with Cowan, who had duty in one of\nthe sentry boxes, and we heard a voice calling softly under us. Fearing\ntreachery, Cowan cried out for a sign. Then the answer came back loudly\nto open to a runner with a message from Colonel Clark to Captain Harrod.\nCowan let the man in, while I ran for the captain, and in five minutes\nit seemed as if every man and woman and child in the fort were awake and\ncrowding around the man by the gates, their eager faces reddened by\nthe smoking pine knots. Where was Clark? What had he been doing? Had he\ndeserted them?\n\n“Deserted ye!” cried the runner, and swore a great oath. Wasn’t Clark\neven then on the Ohio raising a great army with authority from the\nCommonwealth of Virginia to rid them of the red scourge? And would they\ndesert him? Or would they be men and bring from Harrodstown the company\nhe asked for? Then Captain Harrod read the letter asking him to raise\nthe company, and before day had dawned they were ready for the word to\nmarch--ready to leave cabin and clearing, and wife and child, trusting\nin Clark’s judgment for time and place. Never were volunteers mustered\nmore quickly than in that cool April night by the gates of Harrodstown\nStation.\n\n“And we’ll fetch Davy along, for luck,” cried Cowan, catching sight of\nme beside him.\n\n“Sure we’ll be wanting a dhrummer b’y,” said McCann.\n\nAnd so they enrolled me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. THE CAMPAIGN BEGINS\n\n“Davy, take care of my Tom,” cried Polly Ann.\n\nI can see her now, standing among the women by the great hewn gateposts,\nwith little Tom in her arms, holding him out to us as we filed by. And\nthe vision of his little, round face haunted Tom and me for many weary\nmiles of our tramp through the wilderness. I have often thought since\nthat that march of the volunteer company to join Clark at the Falls of\nthe Ohio was a superb example of confidence in one man, and scarce to be\nequalled in history.\n\nIn less than a week we of Captain Harrod’s little company stood on a\nforest-clad bank, gazing spellbound at the troubled waters of a mighty\nriver. That river was the Ohio, and it divided us from the strange north\ncountry whence the savages came. From below, the angry voice of\nthe Great Falls cried out to us unceasingly. Smoke rose through the\ntree-tops of the island opposite, and through the new gaps of its forest\ncabins could be seen. And presently, at a signal from us, a big flatboat\nleft its shore, swung out and circled on the polished current,\nand grounded at length in the mud below us. A dozen tall boatmen,\nbuckskin-clad, dropped the big oars and leaped out on the bank with a\nyell of greeting. At the head of them was a man of huge frame, and long,\nlight hair falling down over the collar of his hunting shirt. He wrung\nCaptain Harrod’s hand.\n\n“That there’s Simon Kenton, Davy,” said Cowan, as we stood watching\nthem.\n\nI ran forward for a better look at the backwoods Hercules, the tales\nof whose prowess had helped to while away many a winter’s night in\nHarrodstown Station. Big-featured and stern, yet he had the kindly eye\nof the most indomitable of frontier fighters, and I doubted not\nthe truth of what was said of him--that he could kill any redskin\nhand-to-hand.\n\n“Clark’s thar,” he was saying to Captain Harrod. “God knows what his\npluck is. He ain’t said a word.”\n\n“He doesn’t say whar he’s going?” said Harrod.\n\n“Not a notion,” answered Kenton. “He’s the greatest man to keep his\nmouth shut I ever saw. He kept at the governor of Virginny till he gave\nhim twelve hundred pounds in Continentals and power to raise troops.\nThen Clark fetched a circle for Fort Pitt, raised some troops thar and\nin Virginny and some about Red Stone, and come down the Ohio here with\n‘em in a lot of flatboats. Now that ye’ve got here the Kentucky boys is\nall in. I come over with Montgomery, and Dillard’s here from the Holston\ncountry with a company.”\n\n“Well,” said Captain Harrod, “I reckon we’ll report.”\n\nI went among the first boat-load, and as the men strained against the\ncurrent, Kenton explained that Colonel Clark had brought a number of\nemigrants down the river with him; that he purposed to leave them\non this island with a little force, that they might raise corn and\nprovisions during the summer; and that he had called the place Corn\nIsland.\n\n“Sure, there’s the Colonel himself,” cried Terence McCann, who was\nin the bow, and indeed I could pick out the familiar figure among\nthe hundred frontiersmen that gathered among the stumps at the\nlanding-place. As our keel scraped they gave a shout that rattled in the\nforest behind them, and Clark came down to the waterside.\n\n“I knew that Harrodstown wouldn’t fail me,” he said, and called every\nman by name as we waded ashore. When I came splashing along after Tom he\npulled me from the water with his two hands.\n\n“Colonel,” said Terence McCann, “we’ve brought ye a dhrummer b’y.”\n\n“We’d have no luck at all without him,” said Cowan, and the men laughed.\n\n“Can you walk an hundred miles without food, Davy?” asked Colonel Clark,\neying me gravely.\n\n“Faith he’s lean as a wolf, and no stomach to hinder him,” said Terence,\nseeing me look troubled. “I’ll not be missing the bit of food the likes\nof him would eat.”\n\n“And as for the heft of him,” added Cowan, “Mac and I’ll not feel it.”\n\nColonel Clark laughed. “Well, boys,” he said, “if you must have him, you\nmust. His Excellency gave me no instructions about a drummer, but we’ll\ntake you, Davy.”\n\nIn those days he was a man that wasted no time, was Colonel Clark, and\nwithin the hour our little detachment had joined the others, felling\ntrees and shaping the log-ends for the cabins. That night, as Tom\nand Cowan and McCann and James Ray lay around their fire, taking\na well-earned rest, a man broke excitedly into the light with a\nkettle-shaped object balanced on his head, which he set down in front of\nus. The man proved to be Swein Poulsson, and the object a big drum,\nand he straightway began to beat upon it a tattoo with improvised\ndrumsticks.\n\n“A Red Stone man,” he cried, “a Red Stone man, he have it in the\nflatboat. It is for Tavy.”\n\n“The saints be good to us,” said Terence, “if it isn’t the King’s own\ndrum he has.” And sure enough, on the head of it gleamed the royal arms\nof England, and on the other side, as we turned it over, the device of a\nregiment. They flung the sling about my neck, and the next day, when the\nlittle army drew up for parade among the stumps, there I was at the end\nof the line, and prouder than any man in the ranks. And Colonel Clark\ncoming to my end of the line paused and smiled and patted me kindly on\nthe cheek.\n\n“Have you put this man on the roll, Harrod?” says he.\n\n“No, Colonel,” answers Captain Harrod, amid the laughter of the men at\nmy end.\n\n“What!” says the Colonel, “what an oversight! From this day he is\ndrummer boy and orderly to the Commander-in-chief. Beat the retreat, my\nman.”\n\nI did my best, and as the men broke ranks they crowded around me,\nlaughing and joking, and Cowan picked me up, drum and all, and carried\nme off, I rapping furiously the while.\n\nAnd so I became a kind of handy boy for the whole regiment from the\nColonel down, for I was willing and glad to work. I cooked the Colonel’s\nmeals, roasting the turkey breasts and saddles of venison that the\nhunters brought in from the mainland, and even made him journey-cake, a\ntrick which Polly Ann had taught me. And when I went about the island,\nif a man were loafing, he would seize his axe and cry, “Here’s Davy,\nhe’ll tell the Colonel on me.” Thanks to the jokes of Terence McCann,\nI gained an owl-like reputation for wisdom amongst these superstitious\nbackwoodsmen, and they came verily to believe that upon my existence\ndepended the success of the campaign. But day after day passed, and no\nsign from Colonel Clark of his intentions.\n\n“There’s a good lad,” said Terence. “He’ll be telling us where we’re\ngoing.”\n\nI was asked the same question by a score or more, but Colonel Clark\nkept his own counsel. He himself was everywhere during the days that\nfollowed, superintending the work on the blockhouse we were building,\nand eying the men. Rumor had it that he was sorting out the sheep from\nthe goats, silently choosing those who were to remain on the island and\nthose who were to take part in the campaign.\n\nAt length the blockhouse stood finished amid the yellow stumps of the\ngreat trees, the trunks of which were in its walls. And suddenly the\norder went forth for the men to draw up in front of it by companies,\nwith the families of the emigrants behind them. It was a picture to fix\nitself in a boy’s mind, and one that I have never forgotten. The line of\nbackwoodsmen, as fine a lot of men as I ever wish to see, bronzed by the\nJune sun, strong and tireless as the wild animals of the forest, stood\nexpectant with rifles grounded. And beside the tallest, at the end of\nthe line, was a diminutive figure with a drum hung in front of it. The\nearly summer wind rustled in the forest, and the never ending song\nof the Great Falls sounded from afar. Apart, square-shouldered and\nindomitable, stood a young man of twenty-six.\n\n“My friends and neighbors,” he said in a firm voice, “there is scarce\na man standing among you to-day who has not suffered at the hands of\nsavages. Some of you have seen wives and children killed before your\neyes--or dragged into captivity. None of you can to-day call the home\nfor which he has risked so much his own. And who, I ask you, is to blame\nfor this hideous war? Whose gold is it that buys guns and powder and\nlead to send the Shawnee and the Iroquois and Algonquin on the warpath?”\n\nHe paused, and a hoarse murmur of anger ran along the ranks.\n\n“Whose gold but George’s, by the grace of God King of Great Britain and\nIreland? And what minions distribute it? Abbott at Kaskaskia, for one,\nand Hamilton at Detroit, the Hair Buyer, for another!”\n\nWhen he spoke Hamilton’s name his voice was nearly drowned by\nimprecations.\n\n“Silence!” cried Clark, sternly, and they were silent. “My friends,\nthe best way for a man to defend himself is to maim his enemy. One year\nsince, when you did me the honor to choose me Commander-in-chief of your\nmilitia in Kentucky, I sent two scouts to Kaskaskia. A dozen years\nago the French owned that place, and St. Vincent, and Detroit, and the\npeople there are still French. My men brought back word that the French\nfeared the Long Knives, as the Indians call us. On the first of October\nI went to Virginia, and some of you thought again that I had deserted\nyou. I went to Williamsburg and wrestled with Governor Patrick Henry and\nhis council, with Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Mason and Mr. Wythe. Virginia\nhad no troops to send us, and her men were fighting barefoot with\nWashington against the armies of the British king. But the governor gave\nme twelve hundred pounds in paper, and with it I have raised the\nlittle force that we have here. And with it we will carry the war into\nHamilton’s country. On the swift waters of this great river which\nflows past us have come tidings to-day, and God Himself has sent them.\nTo-morrow would have been too late. The ships and armies of the French\nking are on their way across the ocean to help us fight the tyrant, and\nthis is the news that we bear to the Kaskaskias. When they hear this,\nthe French of those towns will not fight against us. My friends, we are\ngoing to conquer an empire for liberty, and I can look onward,” he cried\nin a burst of inspired eloquence, sweeping his arm to the northward\ntoward the forests on the far side of the Ohio, “I can look onward\nto the day when these lands will be filled with the cities of a Great\nRepublic. And who among you will falter at such a call?”\n\nThere was a brief silence, and then a shout went up from the ranks that\ndrowned the noise of the Falls, and many fell into antics, some throwing\ntheir coonskin hats in the air, and others cursing and scalping Hamilton\nin mockery, while I pounded on the drum with all my might. But when we\nhad broken ranks the rumor was whispered about that the Holston company\nhad not cheered, and indeed the rest of the day these men went about\nplainly morose and discontented,--some saying openly (and with much\njustice, though we failed to see it then) that they had their own\nfamilies and settlements to defend from the Southern Indians and\nChickamauga bandits, and could not undertake Kentucky’s fight at that\ntime. And when the enthusiasm had burned away a little the disaffection\nspread, and some even of the Kentuckians began to murmur against Clark,\nfor faith or genius was needful to inspire men to his plan. One of the\nmalcontents from Boonesboro came to our fire to argue.\n\n“He’s mad as a medicine man, is Clark, to go into that country with less\nthan two hundred rifles. And he’ll force us, will he? I’d as lief have\nthe King for a master.”\n\nHe brought every man in our circle to his feet,--Ray, McCann, Cowan, and\nTom. But Tom was nearest, and words not coming easily to him he fell on\nthe Boonesboro man instead, and they fought it out for ten minutes in\nthe firelight with half the regiment around them. At the end of it, when\nthe malcontents were carrying their champion away, they were stopped\nsuddenly at the sight of one bursting through the circle into the light,\nand a hush fell upon the quarrel. It was Colonel Clark.\n\n“Are you hurt, McChesney?” he demanded.\n\n“I reckon not much, Colonel,” said Tom, grinning, as he wiped his face.\n\n“If any man deserts this camp to-night,” cried Colonel Clark, swinging\naround, “I swear by God to have him chased and brought back and punished\nas he deserves. Captain Harrod, set a guard.”\n\nI pass quickly over the rest of the incident. How the Holston men and\nsome others escaped in the night in spite of our guard, and swam the\nriver on logs. How at dawn we found them gone, and Kenton and Harrod and\nbrave Captain Montgomery set out in pursuit, with Cowan and Tom and Ray.\nAll day they rode, relentless, and the next evening returned with but\neight weary and sullen fugitives of all those who had deserted.\n\nThe next day the sun rose on a smiling world, the polished reaches of\nthe river golden mirrors reflecting the forest’s green. And we were\nastir with the light, preparing for our journey into the unknown\ncountry. At seven we embarked by companies in the flatboats, waving\na farewell to those who were to be left behind. Some stayed through\ninclination and disaffection: others because Colonel Clark did not\ndeem them equal to the task. But Swein Poulsson came. With tears in his\nlittle blue eyes he had begged the Colonel to take him, and I remember\nhim well on that June morning, his red face perspiring under the white\nbristles of his hair as he strained at the big oar. For we must needs\npull a mile up the stream ere we could reach the passage in which to\nshoot downward to the Falls. Suddenly Poulsson dropped his handle,\ncausing the boat to swing round in the stream, while the men damned him.\nPaying them no attention, he stood pointing into the blinding disk of\nthe sun. Across the edge of it a piece was bitten out in blackness.\n\n“Mein Gott!” he cried, “the world is being ended just now.”\n\n“The holy saints remember us this day!” said McCann, missing a stroke to\ncross himself. “Will ye pull, ye damned Dutchman? Or we’ll be the first\nto slide into hell. This is no kind of a place at all at all.”\n\nBy this time the men all along the line of boats had seen it, and many\nfaltered. Clark’s voice could be heard across the waters urging them\nto pull, while the bows swept across the current. They obeyed him,\nbut steadily the blackness ate out the light, and a weird gloaming\noverspread the scene. River and forest became stern, the men silent. The\nmore ignorant were in fear of a cataclysm, the others taking it for an\nomen.\n\n“Shucks!” said Tom, when appealed to, “I’ve seed it afore, and it come\nall right again.”\n\nClark’s boat rounded the shoal: next our turn came, and then the whole\nline was gliding down the river, the rising roar of the angry waters\nwith which we were soon to grapple coming to us with an added grimness.\nAnd now but a faint rim of light saved us from utter darkness. Big Bill\nCowan, undaunted in war, stared at me with fright written on his face.\n\n“And what ‘ll ye think of it, Davy?” he said.\n\nI glanced at the figure of our commander in the boat ahead, and took\ncourage.\n\n“It’s Hamilton’s scalp hanging by a lock,” I answered, pointing to what\nwas left of the sun. “Soon it will be off, and then we’ll have light\nagain.”\n\nTo my surprise he snatched me from the thwart and held me up with a\nshout, and I saw Colonel Clark turn and look back.\n\n“Davy says the Ha’r Buyer’s sculp hangs by the lock, boys,” he shouted,\npointing at the sun.\n\nThe word was cried from boat to boat, and we could see the men pointing\nupwards and laughing. And then, as the light began to grow, we were in\nthe midst of the tumbling waters, the steersmen straining now right, now\nleft, to keep the prows in the smooth reaches between rock and bar. We\ngained the still pools below, the sun came out once more and smiled on\nthe landscape, and the spirits of the men, reviving, burst all bounds.\n\nThus I earned my reputation as a prophet.\n\nFour days and nights we rowed down the great river, our oars\ndouble-manned, for fear that our coming might be heralded to the French\ntowns. We made our first camp on a green little island at the mouth of\nthe Cherokee, as we then called the Tennessee, and there I set about\ncooking a turkey for Colonel Clark, which Ray had shot. Chancing to look\nup, I saw the Colonel himself watching me.\n\n“How is this, Davy?” said he. “I hear that you have saved my army for me\nbefore we have met the enemy.”\n\n“I did not know it, sir,” I answered.\n\n“Well,” said he, “if you have learned to turn an evil omen into a good\nsign, you know more than some generals. What ails you now?”\n\n“There’s a pirogue, sir,” I cried, staring and pointing.\n\n“Where?” said he, alert all at once. “Here, McChesney, take a crew and\nput out after them.”\n\nHe had scarcely spoken ere Tom and his men were rowing into the sunset,\nthe whole of our little army watching from the bank. Presently the other\nboat was seen coming back with ours, and five strange woodsmen stepped\nashore, our men pressing around them. But Clark flew to the spot, the\nmen giving back.\n\n“Who’s the leader here?” he demanded.\n\nA tall man stepped forward.\n\n“I am,” said he, bewildered but defiant.\n\n“Your name?”\n\n“John Duff,” he answered, as though against his will.\n\n“Your business?”\n\n“Hunters,” said Duff; “and I reckon we’re in our rights.”\n\n“I’ll judge of that,” said our Colonel. “Where are you from?”\n\n“That’s no secret, neither. Kaskasky, ten days gone.”\n\nAt that there was a murmur of surprise from our companies. Clark turned.\n\n“Get your men back,” he said to the captains, who stood about them. And\nall of them not moving: “Get your men back, I say. I’ll have it known\nwho’s in command here.”\n\nAt that the men retired. “Who commands at Kaskaskia?” he demanded of\nDuff.\n\n“Monseer Rocheblave, a Frenchy holding a British commission,” said Duff.\n“And the British Governor Abbott has left Post St. Vincent and gone to\nDetroit. Who be you?” he added suspiciously. “Be you Rebels?”\n\n“Colonel Clark is my name, and I am in the service of the Commonwealth\nof Virginia.”\n\nDuff uttered an exclamatory oath and his manner changed. “Be you Clark?”\n he said with respect. “And you’re going after Kaskasky? Wal, the mility\nis prime, and the Injun scouts is keeping a good lookout. But, Colonel,\nI’ll tell ye something: the Frenchies is etarnal afeard of the Long\nKnives. My God! they’ve got the notion that if you ketch ‘em you’ll burn\nand scalp ‘em same as the Red Sticks.”\n\n“Good,” was all that Clark answered.\n\n“I reckon I don’t know much about what the Rebels is fighting for,” said\nJohn Duff; “but I like your looks, Colonel, and wharever you’re going\nthere’ll be a fight. Me and my boys would kinder like to go along.”\n\nClark did not answer at once, but looked John Duff and his men over\ncarefully.\n\n“Will you take the oath of allegiance to Virginia and the Continental\nCongress?” he asked at length.\n\n“I reckon it won’t pizen us,” said John Duff.\n\n“Hold up your hands,” said Clark, and they took the oath. “Now, my men,”\n said he, “you will be assigned to companies. Does any one among you know\nthe old French trail from Massacre to Kaskaskia?”\n\n“Why,” exclaimed John Duff, “why, Johnny Saunders here can tread it in\nthe dark like the road to the grogshop.”\n\nJohn Saunders, loose limbed, grinning sheepishly, shuffled forward, and\nClark shot a dozen questions at him one after another. Yes, the trail\nhad been blazed the Lord knew how long ago by the French, and given up\nwhen they left Massacre.\n\n“Look you,” said Clark to him, “I am not a man to stand trifling. If\nthere is any deception in this, you will be shot without mercy.”\n\n“And good riddance,” said John Duff. “Boys, we’re Rebels now. Steer\nclear of the Ha’r Buyer.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. KASKASKIA\n\nFor one more day we floated downward on the face of the waters between\nthe forest walls of the wilderness, and at length we landed in a little\ngully on the north shore of the river, and there we hid our boats.\n\n“Davy,” said Colonel Clark, “let’s walk about a bit. Tell me where you\nlearned to be so silent?”\n\n“My father did not like to be talked to,” I answered, “except when he\nwas drinking.”\n\nHe gave me a strange look. Many the stroll I took with him afterwards,\nwhen he sought to relax himself from the cares which the campaign had\nput upon him. This night was still and clear, the west all yellow with\nthe departing light, and the mists coming on the river. And presently,\nas we strayed down the shore we came upon a strange sight, the same\nbeing a huge fort rising from the waterside, all overgrown with brush\nand saplings and tall weeds. The palisades that held its earthenwork\nwere rotten and crumbling, and the mighty bastions of its corners\nsliding away. Behind the fort, at the end farthest from the river, we\ncame upon gravelled walks hidden by the rank growth, where the soldiers\nof his most Christian Majesty once paraded. Lost in thought, Clark stood\non the parapet, watching the water gliding by until the darkness hid\nit,--nay, until the stars came and made golden dimples upon its surface.\nBut as we went back to the camp again he told me how the French had\ntried once to conquer this vast country and failed, leaving to the\nSpaniards the endless stretch beyond the Mississippi called Louisiana,\nand this part to the English. And he told me likewise that this fort\nin the days of its glory had been called Massacre, from a bloody event\nwhich had happened there more than threescore years before.\n\n“Threescore years!” I exclaimed, longing to see the men of this race\nwhich had set up these monuments only to abandon them.\n\n“Ay, lad,” he answered, “before you or I were born, and before our\nfathers were born, the French missionaries and soldiers threaded\nthis wilderness. And they called this river ‘La Belle Rivière,’--the\nBeautiful River.”\n\n“And shall I see that race at Kaskaskia?” I asked, wondering.\n\n“That you shall,” he cried, with a force that left no doubt in my mind.\n\nIn the morning we broke camp and started off for the strange place which\nwe hoped to capture. A hundred miles it was across the trackless wilds,\nand each man was ordered to carry on his back provisions for four days\nonly.\n\n“Herr Gott!” cried Swein Poulsson, from the bottom of a flatboat, whence\nhe was tossing out venison flitches, “four day, und vat is it ve eat\nthen?”\n\n“Frenchies, sure,” said Terence; “there’ll be plenty av thim for a\nseason. Faith, I do hear they’re tinder as lambs.”\n\n“You’ll no set tooth in the Frenchies,” the pessimistic McAndrew put in,\n“wi’ five thousand redskins aboot, and they lying in wait. The Colonel’s\nno vera mindful of that, I’m thinking.”\n\n“Will ye hush, ye ill-omened hound!” cried Cowan, angrily. “Pitch him in\nthe crick, Mac!”\n\nTom was diverted from this duty by a loud quarrel between Captain Harrod\nand five men of the company who wanted scout duty, and on the heels of\nthat came another turmoil occasioned by Cowan’s dropping my drum into\nthe water. While he and McCann and Tom were fishing it out, Colonel\nClark himself appeared, quelled the mutiny that Harrod had on his hands,\nand bade the men sternly to get into ranks.\n\n“What foolishness is this?” he said, eying the dripping drum.\n\n“Sure, Colonel,” said McCann, swinging it on his back, “we’d have no\nheart in us at Kaskasky widout the rattle of it in our ears. Bill Cowan\nand me will not be feeling the heft of it bechune us.”\n\n“Get into ranks,” said the Colonel, amusement struggling with the anger\nin his face as he turned on his heel. His wisdom well knew when to humor\na man, and when to chastise.\n\n“Arrah,” said Terence, as he took his place, “I’d as soon l’ave me gun\nbehind as Davy and the dhrum.”\n\nMethinks I can see now, as I write, the long file of woodsmen with their\nswinging stride, planting one foot before the other, even as the Indian\nhimself threaded the wilderness. Though my legs were short, I had both\nsinew and training, and now I was at one end of the line and now at\nthe other. And often with a laugh some giant would hand his gun to a\nneighbor, swing me to his shoulder, and so give me a lift for a weary\nmile or two; and perchance whisper to me to put down my hand into the\nwallet of his shirt, where I would find a choice morsel which he had\nsaved for his supper. Sometimes I trotted beside the Colonel himself,\nlistening as he talked to this man or that, and thus I got the gravest\nnotion of the daring of this undertaking, and of the dangers ahead of\nus. This north country was infested with Indians, allies of the English\nand friends of the French their subjects; and the fact was never for an\ninstant absent from our minds that our little band might at any moment\nrun into a thousand warriors, be overpowered and massacred; or, worst of\nall, that our coming might have been heralded to Kaskaskia.\n\nFor three days we marched in the green shade of the primeval wood, nor\nsaw the sky save in blue patches here and there. Again we toiled for\nhours through the coffee-colored waters of the swamps. But the third day\nbrought us to the first of those strange clearings which the French call\nprairies, where the long grass ripples like a lake in the summer wind.\nHere we first knew raging thirst, and longed for the loam-specked water\nwe had scorned, as our tired feet tore through the grass. For Saunders,\nour guide, took a line across the open in plain sight of any eye that\nmight be watching from the forest cover. But at length our column\nwavered and halted by reason of some disturbance at the head of it.\nConjectures in our company, the rear guard, became rife at once.\n\n“Run, Davy darlin,’ an’ see what the throuble is,” said Terence.\n\nNothing loath, I made my way to the head of the column, where Bowman’s\ncompany had broken ranks and stood in a ring up to their thighs in the\ngrass. In the centre of the ring, standing on one foot before our angry\nColonel, was Saunders.\n\n“Now, what does this mean?” demanded Clark; “my eye is on you, and\nyou’ve boxed the compass in this last hour.”\n\nSaunders’ jaw dropped.\n\n“I’m guiding you right,” he answered, with that sullenness which comes\nto his kind from fear, “but a man will slip his bearings sometimes in\nthis country.”\n\nClark’s eyes shot fire, and he brought down the stock of his rifle with\na thud.\n\n“By the eternal God!” he cried, “I believe you are a traitor. I’ve been\nwatching you every step, and you’ve acted strangely this morning.”\n\n“Ay, ay,” came from the men round him.\n\n“Silence!” cried Clark, and turned again to the cowering Saunders. “You\npretend to know the way to Kaskaskia, you bring us to the middle of the\nIndian country where we may be wiped out at any time, and now you have\nthe damned effrontery to tell me that you have lost your way. I am a man\nof my word,” he added with a vibrant intensity, and pointed to the limbs\nof a giant tree which stood at the edge of the distant forest. “I will\ngive you half an hour, but as I live, I will leave you hanging there.”\n\nThe man’s brown hand trembled as he clutched his rifle barrel.\n\n“‘Tis a hard country, sir,” he said. “I’m lost. I swear it on the\nevangels.”\n\n“A hard country!” cried Clark. “A man would have to walk over it but\nonce to know it. I believe you are a damned traitor and perjurer,--in\nspite of your oath, a British spy.”\n\nSaunders wiped the sweat from his brow on his buckskin sleeve.\n\n“I reckon I could get the trace, Colonel, if you’d let me go a little\nway into the prairie.”\n\n“Half an hour,” said Clark, “and you’ll not go alone.” Sweeping his eye\nover Bowman’s company, he picked out a man here and a man there to go\nwith Saunders. Then his eye lighted on me. “Where’s McChesney?” he said.\n“Fetch McChesney.”\n\nI ran to get Tom, and seven of them went away, with Saunders in the\nmiddle, Clark watching them like a hawk, while the men sat down in the\ngrass to wait. Fifteen minutes went by, and twenty, and twenty-five, and\nClark was calling for a rope, when some one caught sight of the squad in\nthe distance returning at a run. And when they came within hail it was\nSaunders’ voice we heard, shouting brokenly:--\n\n“I’ve struck it, Colonel, I’ve struck the trace. There’s a pecan at the\nedge of the bottom with my own blaze on it.”\n\n“May you never be as near death again,” said the Colonel, grimly, as he\ngave the order to march.\n\nThe fourth day passed, and we left behind us the patches of forest and\ncame into the open prairie,--as far as the eye could reach a long, level\nsea of waving green. The scanty provisions ran out, hunger was added to\nthe pangs of thirst and weariness, and here and there in the straggling\nfile discontent smouldered and angry undertone was heard. Kaskaskia was\nsomewhere to the west and north; but how far? Clark had misled them. And\nin addition it were foolish to believe that the garrison had not been\nwarned. English soldiers and French militia and Indian allies stood\nready for our reception. Of such was the talk as we lay down in the\ngrass under the stars on the fifth night. For in the rank and file an\nempty stomach is not hopeful.\n\nThe next morning we took up our march silently with the dawn, the\nprairie grouse whirring ahead of us. At last, as afternoon drew on, a\ndark line of green edged the prairie to the westward, and our spirits\nrose. From mouth to mouth ran the word that these were the woods which\nfringed the bluff above Kaskaskia itself. We pressed ahead, and the\ndestiny of the new Republic for which we had fought made us walk unseen.\nExcitement keyed us high; we reached the shade, plunged into it, and\npresently came out staring at the bastioned corners of a fort which rose\nfrom the centre of a clearing. It had once defended the place, but now\nstood abandoned and dismantled. Beyond it, at the edge of the bluff, we\nhalted, astonished. The sun was falling in the west, and below us was\nthe goal for the sight of which we had suffered so much. At our feet,\nacross the wooded bottom, was the Kaskaskia River, and beyond, the\npeaceful little French village with its low houses and orchards and\ngardens colored by the touch of the evening light. In the centre of it\nstood a stone church with its belfry; but our searching eyes alighted on\nthe spot to the southward of it, near the river. There stood a rambling\nstone building with the shingles of its roof weathered black, and all\naround it a palisade of pointed sticks thrust in the ground, and with a\npair of gates and watch-towers. Drooping on its staff was the standard\nof England. North and south of the village the emerald common gleamed in\nthe slanting light, speckled red and white and black by grazing cattle.\nHere and there, in untidy brown patches, were Indian settlements, and\nfar away to the westward the tawny Father of Waters gleamed through the\ncottonwoods.\n\nThrough the waning day the men lay resting under the trees, talking in\nundertones. Some cleaned their rifles, and others lost themselves in\nconjectures of the attack. But Clark himself, tireless, stood with\nfolded arms gazing at the scene below, and the sunlight on his face\nillumined him (to the lad standing at his side) as the servant of\ndestiny. At length, at eventide, the sweet-toned bell of the little\ncathedral rang to vespers,--a gentle message of peace to war. Colonel\nClark looked into my upturned face.\n\n“Davy, do you know what day this is?” he asked.\n\n“No, sir,” I answered.\n\n“Two years have gone since the bells pealed for the birth of a new\nnation--your nation, Davy, and mine--the nation that is to be the refuge\nof the oppressed of this earth--the nation which is to be made of all\npeoples, out of all time. And this land for which you and I shall fight\nto-night will belong to it, and the lands beyond,” he pointed to the\nwest, “until the sun sets on the sea again.” He put his hand on my head.\n“You will remember this when I am dead and gone,” he said.\n\nI was silent, awed by the power of his words.\n\nDarkness fell, and still we waited, impatient for the order. And when at\nlast it came the men bustled hither and thither to find their commands,\nand we picked our way on the unseen road that led down the bluff, our\nhearts thumping. The lights of the village twinkled at our feet, and\nnow and then a voice from below was caught and borne upward to us. Once\nanother noise startled us, followed by an exclamation, “Donnerblitzen”\n and a volley of low curses from the company. Poor Swein Poulsson had\nloosed a stone, which had taken a reverberating flight riverward.\n\nWe reached the bottom, and the long file turned and hurried silently\nnorthward, searching for a crossing. I try to recall my feelings as I\ntrotted beside the tall forms that loomed above me in the night. The\nsense of protection they gave me stripped me of fear, and I was not\ntroubled with that. My thoughts were chiefly on Polly Ann and the child\nwe had left in the fort now so far to the south of us, and in my fancy\nI saw her cheerful, ever helpful to those around her, despite the load\nthat must rest on her heart. I saw her simple joy at our return. But\nshould we return? My chest tightened, and I sped along the ranks to\nHarrod’s company and caught Tom by the wrist.\n\n“Davy,” he murmured, and, seizing my hand in his strong grip, pulled me\nalong with him. For it was not given to him to say what he felt; but\nas I hurried to keep pace with his stride, Polly Ann’s words rang in my\nears, “Davy, take care of my Tom,” and I knew that he, too, was thinking\nof her.\n\nA hail aroused me, the sound of a loud rapping, and I saw in black\nrelief a cabin ahead. The door opened, a man came out with a horde of\nchildren cowering at his heels, a volley of frightened words pouring\nfrom his mouth in a strange tongue. John Duff was plying him with\nquestions in French, and presently the man became calmer and lapsed into\nbroken English.\n\n“Kaskaskia--yes, she is prepare. Many spy is gone out--cross la rivière.\nBut now they all sleep.”\n\nEven as he spoke a shout came faintly from the distant town.\n\n“What is that?” demanded Clark, sharply.\n\nThe man shrugged his shoulders. “Une fête des nègres, peut-être,--the\nnegro, he dance maybe.”\n\n“Are you the ferryman?” said Clark.\n\n“Oui--I have some boat.”\n\nWe crossed the hundred and fifty yards of sluggish water, squad by\nsquad, and in the silence of the night stood gathered, expectant, on the\nfarther bank. Midnight was at hand. Commands were passed about, and men\nran this way and that, jostling one another to find their places in a\nnew order. But at length our little force stood in three detachments\non the river’s bank, their captains repeating again and again the part\nwhich each was to play, that none might mistake his duty. The two larger\nones were to surround the town, while the picked force under Simon\nKenton himself was to storm the fort. Should he gain it by surprise and\nwithout battle, three shots were to be fired in quick succession, the\nother detachments were to start the war-whoop, while Duff and some with\na smattering of French were to run up and down the streets proclaiming\nthat every habitan who left his house would be shot. No provision being\nmade for the drummer boy (I had left my drum on the heights above), I\nchose the favored column, at the head of which Tom and Cowan and Ray\nand McCann were striding behind Kenton and Colonel Clark. Not a word\nwas spoken. There was a kind of cow-path that rose and fell and twisted\nalong the river-bank. This we followed, and in ten minutes we must\nhave covered the mile to the now darkened village. The starlight alone\noutlined against the sky the houses of it as we climbed the bank. Then\nwe halted, breathless, in a street, but there was no sound save that\nof the crickets and the frogs. Forward again, and twisting a corner,\nwe beheld the indented edge of the stockade. Still no hail, nor had our\nmoccasined feet betrayed us as we sought the river side of the fort\nand drew up before the big river gates of it. Simon Kenton bore against\nthem, and tried the little postern that was set there, but both were\nfast. The spikes towered a dozen feet overhead.\n\n“Quick!” muttered Clark, “a light man to go over and open the postern.”\n\nBefore I guessed what was in his mind, Cowan seized me.\n\n“Send the lad, Colonel,” said he.\n\n“Ay, ay,” said Simon Kenton, hoarsely.\n\nIn a second Tom was on Kenton’s shoulders, and they passed me up with\nas little trouble as though I had been my own drum. Feverishly searching\nwith my foot for Tom’s shoulder, I seized the spikes at the top,\nclambered over them, paused, surveyed the empty area below me,\ndestitute even of a sentry, and then let myself down with the aid of the\ncross-bars inside. As I was feeling vainly for the bolt of the postern,\nrays of light suddenly shot my shadow against the door. And next, as\nI got my hand on the bolt-head, I felt the weight of another on my\nshoulder, and a voice behind me said in English:--\n\n“In the devil’s name!”\n\nI gave the one frantic pull, the bolt slipped, and caught again. Then\nColonel Clark’s voice rang out in the night:--\n\n“Open the gate! Open the gate in the name of Virginia and the\nContinental Congress!”\n\nBefore I could cry out the man gave a grunt, leaned his gun against the\ngate, and tore my fingers from the bolt-handle. Astonishment robbed me\nof breath as he threw open the postern.\n\n“In the name of the Continental Congress,” he cried, and seized his gun.\nClark and Kenton stepped in instantly, no doubt as astounded as I, and\nhad the man in their grasp.\n\n“Who are you?” said Clark.\n\n“Name o’ Skene, from Pennsylvanya,” said the man, “and by the Lord God\nye shall have the fort.”\n\n“You looked for us?” said Clark.\n\n“Faith, never less,” said the Pennsylvanian. “The one sentry is at the\nmain gate.”\n\n“And the governor?”\n\n“Rocheblave?” said the Pennsylvanian. “He sleeps yonder in the old\nJesuit house in the middle.”\n\nClark turned to Tom McChesney, who was at his elbow.\n\n“Corporal!” said he, swiftly, “secure the sentry at the main gate! You,”\n he added, turning to the Pennsylvanian, “lead us to the governor. But\nmind, if you betray me, I’ll be the first to blow out your brains.”\n\nThe man seized a lantern and made swiftly over the level ground until\nthe rubble-work of the old Jesuit house showed in the light, nor Clark\nnor any of them stopped to think of the danger our little handful ran\nat the mercy of a stranger. The house was silent. We halted, and Clark\nthrew himself against the rude panels of the door, which gave to inward\nblackness. Our men filled the little passage, and suddenly we found\nourselves in a low-ceiled room in front of a great four-poster bed. And\nin it, upright, blinking at the light, were two odd Frenchified figures\nin tasselled nightcaps. Astonishment and anger and fear struggled in the\nfaces of Monsieur de Rocheblave and his lady. A regard for truth\ncompels me to admit that it was madame who first found her voice, and no\nuncertain one it was.\n\nFirst came a shriek that might have roused the garrison.\n\n“Villains! Murderers! Outragers of decency!” she cried with spirit,\npouring a heap of invectives, now in French, now in English, much to the\ndiscomfiture of our backwoodsmen, who peered at her helplessly.\n\n“Nom du diable!” cried the commandant, when his lady’s breath was gone,\n“what does this mean?”\n\n“It means, sir,” answered Clark, promptly, “that you are my prisoner.”\n\n“And who are you?” gasped the commandant.\n\n“George Rogers Clark, Colonel in the service of the Commonwealth of\nVirginia.” He held out his hand restrainingly, for the furious Monsieur\nRocheblave made an attempt to rise. “You will oblige me by remaining in\nbed, sir, for a moment.”\n\n“Coquins! Canailles! Cochons!” shrieked the lady.\n\n“Madame,” said Colonel Clark, politely, “the necessities of war are\noften cruel.”\n\nHe made a bow, and paying no further attention to the torrent of her\nreproaches or the threats of the helpless commandant, he calmly searched\nthe room with the lantern, and finally pulled out from under the bed a\nmetal despatch box. Then he lighted a candle in a brass candlestick\nthat stood on the simple walnut dresser, and bowed again to the outraged\ncouple in the four-poster.\n\n“Now, sir,” he said, “you may dress. We will retire.”\n\n“Pardieu!” said the commandant in French, “a hundred thousand thanks.”\n\nWe had scarcely closed the bedroom door when three shots were heard.\n\n“The signal!” exclaimed Clark.\n\nImmediately a pandemonium broke on the silence of the night that must\nhave struck cold terror in the hearts of the poor Creoles sleeping in\ntheir beds. The war-whoop, the scalp halloo in the dead of the morning,\nwith the hideous winding notes of them that reached the bluff beyond\nand echoed back, were enough to frighten a man from his senses. In the\nintervals, in backwoods French, John Duff and his companions were heard\nin terrifying tones crying out to the habitans to venture out at the\nperil of their lives. Within the fort a score of lights flew up and down\nlike will-o’-the-wisps, and Colonel Clark, standing on the steps of the\ngovernor’s house, gave out his orders and despatched his messengers. Me\nhe sent speeding through the village to tell Captain Bowman to patrol\nthe outskirts of the town, that no runner might get through to warn Fort\nChartres and Cohos, as some called Cahokia. None stirred save the few\nIndians left in the place, and these were brought before Clark in\nthe fort, sullen and defiant, and put in the guard-house there. And\nRocheblave, when he appeared, was no better, and was put back in his\nhouse under guard.\n\nAs for the papers in the despatch box, they revealed I know not what\nbriberies of the savage nations and plans of the English. But of\nother papers we found none, though there must have been more. Madame\nRocheblave was suspected of having hidden some in the inviolable\nportions of her dress.\n\nAt length the cocks crowing for day proclaimed the morning, and while\nyet the blue shadow of the bluff was on the town, Colonel Clark sallied\nout of the gate and walked abroad. Strange it seemed that war had come\nto this village, so peaceful and remote. And even stranger it seemed to\nme to see these Arcadian homes in the midst of the fierce wilderness.\nThe little houses with their sloping roofs and wide porches, the gardens\nablaze with color, the neat palings,--all were a restful sight for our\nweary eyes. And now I scarcely knew our commander. For we had not gone\nfar ere, timidly, a door opened and a mild-visaged man, in the simple\nworkaday smock that the French wore, stood, hesitating, on the steps.\nThe odd thing was that he should have bowed to Clark, who was dressed\nno differently from Bowman and Harrod and Duff; and the man’s voice\ntrembled piteously as he spoke. It needed not John Duff to tell us that\nhe was pleading for the lives of his family.\n\n“He will sell himself as a slave if your Excellency will spare them,”\nsaid Duff, translating.\n\nBut Clark stared at the man sternly.\n\n“I will tell them my plans at the proper time,” he said and when Duff\nhad translated this the man turned and went silently into his house\nagain, closing the door behind him. And before we had traversed the\nvillage the same thing had happened many times. We gained the fort\nagain, I wondering greatly why he had not reassured these simple people.\nIt was Bowman who asked this question, he being closer to Clark than any\nof the other captains. Clark said nothing then, and began to give out\ndirections for the day. But presently he called the Captain aside.\n\n“Bowman,” I heard him say, “we have one hundred and fifty men to hold\na province bigger than the whole of France, and filled with treacherous\ntribes in the King’s pay. I must work out the problem for myself.”\n\nBowman was silent. Clark, with that touch which made men love him and\ndie for him, laid his hand on the Captain’s shoulder.\n\n“Have the men called in by detachments,” he said, “and fed. God knows\nthey must be hungry,--and you.”\n\nSuddenly I remembered that he himself had had nothing. Running around\nthe commandant’s house to the kitchen door, I came unexpectedly upon\nSwein Poulsson, who was face to face with the linsey-woolsey-clad figure\nof Monsieur Rocheblave’s negro cook. The early sun cast long shadows of\nthem on the ground.\n\n“By tam,” my friend was saying, “so I vill eat. I am choost like an ox\nfor three days, und chew grass. Prairie grass, is it?”\n\n“Mo pas capab’, Michié,” said the cook, with a terrified roll of his\nwhite eyes.\n\n“Herr Gott!” cried Swein Poulsson, “I am red face. Aber Herr Gott,\nI thank thee I am not a nigger. Und my hair is bristles, yes. Davy”\n(spying me), “I thank Herr Gott it is not vool. Let us in the kitchen\ngo.”\n\n“I am come to get something for the Colonel’s breakfast,” said I,\npushing past the slave, through the open doorway. Swein Poulsson\nfollowed, and here I struck another contradiction in his strange nature.\nHe helped me light the fire in the great stone chimney-place, and we\nsoon had a pot of hominy on the crane, and turning on the spit a piece\nof buffalo steak which we found in the larder. Nor did a mouthful pass\nhis lips until I had sped away with a steaming portion to find the\nColonel. By this time the men had broken into the storehouse, and the\nopen place was dotted with their breakfast fires. Clark was standing\nalone by the flagstaff, his face careworn. But he smiled as he saw me\ncoming.\n\n“What’s this?” says he.\n\n“Your breakfast, sir,” I answered. I set down the plate and the pot\nbefore him and pressed the pewter spoon into his hand.\n\n“Davy,” said he.\n\n“Sir?” said I.\n\n“What did you have for your breakfast?”\n\nMy lip trembled, for I was very hungry, and the rich steam from the\nhominy was as much as I could stand. Then the Colonel took me by the\narms, as gently as a woman might, set me down on the ground beside him,\nand taking a spoonful of the hominy forced it between my lips. I was\nnear to fainting at the taste of it. Then he took a bit himself,\nand divided the buffalo steak with his own hands. And when from the\ncamp-fires they perceived the Colonel and the drummer boy eating\ntogether in plain sight of all, they gave a rousing cheer.\n\n“Swein Poulsson helped get your breakfast, sir, and would eat nothing\neither,” I ventured.\n\n“Davy,” said Colonel Clark, gravely, “I hope you will be younger when\nyou are twenty.”\n\n“I hope I shall be bigger, sir,” I answered gravely.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. HOW THE KASKASKEIANS WERE MADE CITIZENS\n\nNever before had such a day dawned upon Kaskaskia. With July fierceness\nthe sun beat down upon the village, but man nor woman nor child stirred\nfrom the darkened houses. What they awaited at the hands of the Long\nKnives they knew not,--captivity, torture, death perhaps. Through the\ndeserted streets stalked a squad of backwoodsmen headed by John Duff and\ntwo American traders found in the town, who were bestirring themselves\nin our behalf, knocking now at this door and anon at that.\n\n“The Colonel bids you come to the fort,” he said, and was gone.\n\nThe church bell rang with slow, ominous strokes, far different from its\ngentle vesper peal of yesterday. Two companies were drawn up in the sun\nbefore the old Jesuit house, and presently through the gate a procession\ncame, grave and mournful. The tone of it was sombre in the white\nglare, for men had donned their best (as they thought) for the last\ntime,--cloth of camlet and Cadiz and Limbourg, white cotton stockings,\nand brass-buckled shoes. They came like captives led to execution. But\nat their head a figure held our eye,--a figure that spoke of dignity and\ncourage, of trials borne for others. It was the village priest in\nhis robes. He had a receding forehead and a strong, pointed chin; but\nbenevolence was in the curve of his great nose. I have many times since\nseen his type of face in the French prints. He and his flock halted\nbefore our young Colonel, even as the citizens of Calais in a bygone\ncentury must have stood before the English king.\n\nThe scene comes back to me. On the one side, not the warriors of a\nnation that has made its mark in war, but peaceful peasants who had\nsought this place for its remoteness from persecution, to live and die\nin harmony with all mankind. On the other, the sinewy advance guard of a\nrace that knows not peace, whose goddess of liberty carries in her hand\na sword. The plough might have been graven on our arms, but always the\nrifle.\n\nThe silence of the trackless wilds reigned while Clark gazed at them\nsternly. And when he spoke it was with the voice of a conqueror, and\nthey listened as the conquered listen, with heads bowed--all save the\npriest.\n\nClark told them first that they had been given a false and a wicked\nnotion of the American cause, and he spoke of the tyranny of the\nEnglish king, which had become past endurance to a free people. As for\nourselves, the Long Knives, we came in truth to conquer, and because of\ntheir hasty judgment the Kaskaskians were at our mercy. The British had\ntold them that the Kentuckians were a barbarous people, and they had\nbelieved.\n\nHe paused that John Duff might translate and the gist of what he had\nsaid sink in. But suddenly the priest had stepped out from the ranks,\nfaced his people, and was himself translating in a strong voice. When\nhe had finished a tremor shook the group. But he turned calmly and faced\nClark once more.\n\n“Citizens of Kaskaskia,” Colonel Clark went on, “the king whom you\nrenounced when the English conquered you, the great King of France, has\njudged for you and the French people. Knowing that the American cause is\njust, he is sending his fleets and regiments to fight for it against the\nBritish King, who until now has been your sovereign.”\n\nAgain he paused, and when the priest had told them this, a murmur of\nastonishment came from the boldest.\n\n“Citizens of Kaskaskia, know you that the Long Knives come not to\nmassacre, as you foolishly believed, but to release from bondage. We are\ncome not against you, who have been deceived, but against those soldiers\nof the British King who have bribed the savages to slaughter our\nwives and children. You have but to take the oath of allegiance to\nthe Continental Congress to become free, even as we are, to enjoy the\nblessings of that American government under which we live and for which\nwe fight.”\n\nThe face of the good priest kindled as he glanced at Clark. He turned\nonce more, and though we could not understand his words, the thrill of\nhis eloquence moved us. And when he had finished there was a moment’s\nhush of inarticulate joy among his flock, and then such transports as\nmoved strangely the sternest men in our ranks. The simple people fell\nto embracing each other and praising God, the tears running on their\ncheeks. Out of the group came an old man. A skullcap rested on his\nsilvered hair, and he felt the ground uncertainly with his gold-headed\nstick.\n\n“Monsieur,” he said tremulously “you will pardon an old man if he show\nfeeling. I am born seventy year ago in Gascon. I inhabit this country\nthirty year, and last night I think I not live any longer. Last night\nwe make our peace with the good God, and come here to-day to die. But\nwe know you not,” he cried, with a sudden and surprising vigor; “ha, we\nknow you not! They told us lies, and we were humble and believed. But\nnow we are Américains,” he cried, his voice pitched high, as he pointed\nwith a trembling arm to the stars and stripes above him. “Mes enfants,\nvive les Bostonnais! Vive les Américains! Vive Monsieur le Colonel\nClark, sauveur de Kaskaskia!”\n\nThe listening village heard the shout and wondered. And when it had died\ndown Colonel Clark took the old Gascon by the hand, and not a man of his\nbut saw that this was a master-stroke of his genius.\n\n“My friends,” he said simply, “I thank you. I would not force you, and\nyou will have some days to think over the oath of allegiance to the\nRepublic. Go now to your homes, and tell those who are awaiting you what\nI have said. And if any man of French birth wish to leave this place, he\nmay go of his own free will, save only three whom I suspect are not our\nfriends.”\n\nThey turned, and in an ecstasy of joy quite pitiful to see went trooping\nout of the gate. But scarce could they have reached the street and\nwe have broken ranks, when we saw them coming back again, the priest\nleading them as before. They drew near to the spot where Clark stood,\ntalking to the captains, and halted expectantly.\n\n“What is it, my friends?” asked the Colonel.\n\nThe priest came forward and bowed gravely.\n\n“I am Père Gibault, sir,” he said, “curé of Kaskaskia.” He paused,\nsurveying our commander with a clear eye. “There is something that still\ntroubles the good citizens.”\n\n“And what is that, sir?” said Clark.\n\nThe priest hesitated.\n\n“If your Excellency will only allow the church to be opened--” he\nventured.\n\nThe group stood wistful, fearful that their boldness had displeased,\nexpectant of reprimand.\n\n“My good Father,” said Colonel Clark, “an American commander has but one\nrelation to any church. And that is” (he added with force) “to protect\nit. For all religions are equal before the Republic.”\n\nThe priest gazed at him intently.\n\n“By that answer,” said he, “your Excellency has made for your government\nloyal citizens in Kaskaskia.”\n\nThen the Colonel stepped up to the priest and took him likewise by the\nhand.\n\n“I have arranged for a house in town,” said he. “Monsieur Rocheblave has\nrefused to dine with me there. Will you do me that honor, Father?”\n\n“With all my heart, your Excellency,” said Father Gibault. And turning\nto the people, he translated what the Colonel had said. Then their\ncup of happiness was indeed full, and some ran to Clark and would have\nthrown their arms about him had he been a man to embrace. Hurrying\nout of the gate, they spread the news like wildfire, and presently the\nchurch bell clanged in tones of unmistakable joy.\n\n“Sure, Davy dear, it puts me in mind of the Saints’ day at home,” said\nTerence, as he stood leaning against a picket fence that bordered the\nstreet, “savin’ the presence of the naygurs and thim red divils wid\nblankets an’ scowls as wud turrn the milk sour in the pail.”\n\nHe had stopped beside two Kaskaskia warriors in scarlet blankets who\nstood at the corner, watching with silent contempt the antics of the\nFrench inhabitants. Now and again one or the other gave a grunt and\nwrapped his blanket more tightly about him.\n\n“Umrrhh!” said Terence. “Faith, I talk that langwidge mesilf when I\nhave throuble.” The warriors stared at him with what might be called\na stoical surprise. “Umrrh! Does the holy father praych to ye wid\nthim wurrds, ye haythens? Begorra, ‘tis a wondher ye wuddent wash\nyereselves,” he added, making a face, “wid muddy wather to be had for\nthe askin’.”\n\nWe moved on, through such a scene as I have seldom beheld. The village\nhad donned its best: women in cap and gown were hurrying hither and\nthither, some laughing and some weeping; grown men embraced each\nother; children of all colors flung themselves against Terence’s\nlegs,--dark-haired Creoles, little negroes with woolly pates, and naked\nIndian lads with bow and arrow. Terence dashed at them now and then, and\nthey fled screaming into dooryards to come out again and mimic him when\nhe had passed, while mothers and fathers and grandfathers smiled at the\ngood nature in his Irish face. Presently he looked down at me comically.\n\n“Why wuddent ye be doin’ the like, Davy?” he asked. “Amusha! ‘tis mesilf\nthat wants to run and hop and skip wid the childher. Ye put me in mind\nof a wizened old man that sat all day makin’ shoes in Killarney,--all\nsavin’ the fringe he had on his chin.”\n\n“A soldier must be dignified,” I answered.\n\n“The saints bar that wurrd from hiven,” said Terence, trying to\npronounce it. “Come, we’ll go to mass, or me mother will be visitin’ me\nthis night.”\n\nWe crossed the square and went into the darkened church, where the\ncandles were burning. It was the first church I had ever entered, and I\nheard with awe the voice of the priest and the fervent responses, but\nI understood not a word of what was said. Afterwards Father Gibault\nmounted to the pulpit and stood for a moment with his hand raised above\nhis flock, and then began to speak. What he told them I have learned\nsince. And this I know, that when they came out again into the sunlit\nsquare they were Americans. It matters not when they took the oath.\n\nAs we walked back towards the fort we came to a little house with a\nflower garden in front of it, and there stood Colonel Clark himself by\nthe gate. He stopped us with a motion of his hand.\n\n“Davy,” said he, “we are to live here for a while, you and I. What do\nyou think of our headquarters?” He did not wait for me to reply, but\ncontinued, “Can you suggest any improvement?”\n\n“You will be needing a soldier to be on guard in front, sir,” said I.\n\n“Ah,” said the Colonel, “McChesney is too valuable a man. I am sending\nhim with Captain Bowman to take Cahokia.”\n\n“Would you have Terence, sir?” I ventured, while Terence grinned.\nWhereupon Colonel Clark sent him to report to his captain that he was\ndetailed for orderly duty to the commanding officer. And within half an\nhour he was standing guard in the flower garden, making grimaces at the\nchildren in the street. Colonel Clark sat at a table in the little front\nroom, and while two of Monsieur Rocheblave’s negroes cooked his dinner,\nhe was busy with a score of visitors, organizing, advising, planning,\nand commanding. There were disputes to settle now that alarm had\nsubsided, and at noon three excitable gentlemen came in to inform\nagainst a certain Monsieur Cerre, merchant and trader, then absent at\nSt. Louis. When at length the Colonel had succeeded in bringing their\ndenunciations to an end and they had departed, he looked at me comically\nas I stood in the doorway.\n\n“Davy,” said he, “all I ask of the good Lord is that He will frighten me\nincontinently for a month before I die.”\n\n“I think He would find that difficult, sir,” I answered.\n\n“Then there’s no hope for me,” he answered, laughing, “for I have\nobserved that fright alone brings a man into a fit spiritual state to\nenter heaven. What would you say of those slanderers of Monsieur Cerre?”\n\nNot expecting an answer, he dipped his quill into the ink-pot and turned\nto his papers.\n\n“I should say that they owed Monsieur Cerre money,” I replied.\n\nThe Colonel dropped his quill and stared. As for me, I was puzzled to\nknow why.\n\n“Egad,” said Colonel Clark, “most of us get by hard knocks what you seem\nto have been born with.” He fell to musing, a worried look coming on his\nface that was no stranger to me later, and his hand fell heavily on\nthe loose pile of paper before him. “Davy,” says he, “I need a\ncommissary-general.”\n\n“What would that be, sir,” I asked.\n\n“A John Law, who will make something out of nothing, who will make\nmoney out of this blank paper, who will wheedle the Creole traders into\nbelieving they are doing us a favor and making their everlasting fortune\nby advancing us flour and bacon.”\n\n“And doesn’t Congress make money, sir?” I asked.\n\n“That they do, Davy, by the ton,” he replied, “and so must we, as\nthe rulers of a great province. For mark me, though the men are happy\nto-day, in four days they will be grumbling and trying to desert in\ndozens.”\n\nWe were interrupted by a knock at the door, and there stood Terence\nMcCann.\n\n“His riverence!” he announced, and bowed low as the priest came into the\nroom.\n\nI was bid by Colonel Clark to sit down and dine with them on the good\nthings which Monsieur Rocheblave’s cook had prepared. After dinner they\nwent into the little orchard behind the house and sat drinking (in the\nFrench fashion) the commandant’s precious coffee which had been sent\nto him from far-away New Orleans. Colonel Clark plied the priest with\nquestions of the French towns under English rule: and Father Gibault,\nspeaking for his simple people, said that the English had led them\neasily to believe that the Kentuckians were cutthroats.\n\n“Ah, monsieur,” he said, “if they but knew you! If they but knew the\nprinciples of that government for which you fight, they would renounce\nthe English allegiance, and the whole of this territory would be yours.\nI know them, from Quebec to Detroit and Michilimackinac and Saint\nVincennes. Listen, monsieur,” he cried, his homely face alight; “I\nmyself will go to Saint Vincennes for you. I will tell them the truth,\nand you shall have the post for the asking.”\n\n“You will go to Vincennes!” exclaimed Clark; “a hard and dangerous\njourney of a hundred leagues!”\n\n“Monsieur,” answered the priest, simply, “the journey is nothing. For a\ncentury the missionaries of the Church have walked this wilderness alone\nwith God. Often they have suffered, and often died in tortures--but\ngladly.”\n\nColonel Clark regarded the man intently.\n\n“The cause of liberty, both religious and civil, is our cause,” Father\nGibault continued. “Men have died for it, and will die for it, and it\nwill prosper. Furthermore, Monsieur, my life has not known many wants.\nI have saved something to keep my old age, with which to buy a little\nhouse and an orchard in this peaceful place. The sum I have is at your\nservice. The good Congress will repay me. And you need the money.”\n\nColonel Clark was not an impulsive man, but he felt none the less\ndeeply, as I know well. His reply to this generous offer was almost\nbrusque, but it did not deceive the priest.\n\n“Nay, monsieur,” he said, “it is for mankind I give it, in remembrance\nof Him who gave everything. And though I receive nothing in return, I\nshall have my reward an hundred fold.”\n\nIn due time, I know not how, the talk swung round again to lightness,\nfor the Colonel loved a good story, and the priest had many which he\ntold with wit in his quaint French accent. As he was rising to take his\nleave, Père Gibault put his hand on my head.\n\n“I saw your Excellency’s son in the church this morning,” he said.\n\nColonel Clark laughed and gave me a pinch.\n\n“My dear sir,” he said, “the boy is old enough to be my father.”\n\nThe priest looked down at me with a puzzled expression in his brown\neyes.\n\n“I would I had him for my son,” said Colonel Clark, kindly; “but the lad\nis eleven, and I shall not be twenty-six until next November.”\n\n“Your Excellency not twenty-six!” cried Father Gibault, in astonishment.\n“What will you be when you are thirty?”\n\nThe young Colonel’s face clouded.\n\n“God knows!” he said.\n\nFather Gibault dropped his eyes and turned to me with native tact.\n\n“What would you like best to do, my son?” he asked.\n\n“I should like to learn to speak French,” said I, for I had been much\nirritated at not understanding what was said in the streets.\n\n“And so you shall,” said Father Gibault; “I myself will teach you. You\nmust come to my house to-day.”\n\n“And Davy will teach me,” said the Colonel.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. DAYS OF TRIAL\n\nBut I was not immediately to take up the study of French. Things began\nto happen in Kaskaskia. In the first place, Captain Bowman’s company,\nwith a few scouts, of which Tom was one, set out that very afternoon for\nthe capture of Cohos, or Cahokia, and this despite the fact that they\nhad had no sleep for two nights. If you will look at the map, ¹ you\nwill see, dotted along the bottoms and the bluffs beside the great\nMississippi, the string of villages, Kaskaskia, La Prairie du Rocher,\nFort Chartres, St. Philip, and Cahokia. Some few miles from Cahokia, on\nthe western bank of the Father of Waters, was the little French village\nof St. Louis, in the Spanish territory of Louisiana. From thence\neastward stretched the great waste of prairie and forest inhabited by\nroving bands of the forty Indian nations. Then you come to Vincennes on\nthe Wabash, Fort St. Vincent, the English and Canadians called it, for\nthere were a few of the latter who had settled in Kaskaskia since the\nEnglish occupation. ¹The best map which the editor has found of this\ndistrict is in vol. VI, Part 11, of Winsor’s “Narrative and Critical\nHistory of America,” p. 721.\n\nWe gathered on the western skirts of the village to give Bowman’s\ncompany a cheer, and every man, woman, and child in the place watched\nthe little column as it wound snakelike over the prairie on the road to\nFort Chartres, until it was lost in the cottonwoods to the westward.\n\nThings began to happen in Kaskaskia. It would have been strange indeed\nif things had not happened. One hundred and seventy-five men had marched\ninto that territory out of which now are carved the great states of\nOhio, Indiana, and Illinois, and to most of them the thing was a picnic,\na jaunt which would soon be finished. Many had left families in the\nfrontier forts without protection. The time of their enlistment had\nalmost expired.\n\nThere was a store in the village kept by a great citizen,--not a citizen\nof Kaskaskia alone, but a citizen of the world. This, I am aware, sounds\nlike fiction, like an attempt to get an effect which was not there. But\nit is true as gospel. The owner of this store had many others scattered\nabout in this foreign country: at Vincennes, at St. Louis, where he\nresided, at Cahokia. He knew Michilimackinac and Quebec and New Orleans.\nHe had been born some thirty-one years before in Sardinia, had served\nin the Spanish army, and was still a Spanish subject. The name of this\nfamous gentleman was Monsieur François Vigo, and he was the Rothschild\nof the country north of the Ohio. Monsieur Vigo, though he merited it,\nI had not room to mention in the last chapter. Clark had routed him from\nhis bed on the morning of our arrival, and whether or not he had been in\nthe secret of frightening the inhabitants into making their wills, and\nthen throwing them into transports of joy, I know not.\n\nMonsieur Vigo’s store was the village club. It had neither glass in the\nwindow nor an attractive display of goods; it was merely a log cabin set\ndown on a weedy, sun-baked plot. The stuffy smell of skins and furs came\nout of the doorway. Within, when he was in Kaskaskia, Monsieur Vigo was\nwont to sit behind his rough walnut table, writing with a fine quill,\nor dispensing the news of the villages to the priest and other prominent\ncitizens, or haggling with persistent blanketed braves over canoe-loads\nof ill-smelling pelts which they brought down from the green forests of\nthe north. Monsieur Vigo’s clothes were the color of the tobacco he gave\nin exchange; his eyes were not unlike the black beads he traded, but\nshrewd and kindly withal, set in a square saffron face that had the\ncontradiction of a small chin. As the days wore into months, Monsieur\nVigo’s place very naturally became the headquarters for our army, if\narmy it might be called. Of a morning a dozen would be sitting against\nthe logs in the black shadow, and in the midst of them always squatted\nan unsavory Indian squaw. A few braves usually stood like statues at\nthe corner, and in front of the door another group of hunting shirts.\nWithout was the paper money of the Continental Congress, within the good\ntafia and tobacco of Monsieur Vigo. One day Monsieur Vigo’s young Creole\nclerk stood shrugging his shoulders in the doorway. I stopped.\n\n“By tam!” Swein Poulsson was crying to the clerk, as he waved a\nworthless scrip above his head. “Vat is money?”\n\nThis definition the clerk, not being a Doctor Johnson, was unable to\ngive offhand.\n\n“Vat are you, choost? Is it America?” demanded Poulsson, while the\nothers looked on, some laughing, some serious. “And vich citizen are you\nsince you are ours? You vill please to give me one carrot of tobacco.”\nAnd he thrust the scrip under the clerk’s nose.\n\nThe clerk stared at the uneven lettering on the scrip with disdain.\n\n“Money,” he exclaimed scornfully, “she is not money. Piastre--Spanish\ndollare--then I give you carrot.”\n\n“By God!” shouted Bill Cowan, “ye will take Virginny paper, and Congress\npaper, or else I reckon we’ll have a drink and tobaccy, boys, take or no\ntake.”\n\n“Hooray, Bill, ye’re right,” cried several of our men.\n\n“Lemme in here,” said Cowan. But the frightened Creole blocked the\ndoorway.\n\n“Sacré!” he screamed, and then, “Voleurs!”\n\nThe excitement drew a number of people from the neighborhood. Nay, it\nseemed as if the whole town was ringed about us.\n\n“Bravo, Jules!” they cried, “garde-tu la porte. À bas les Bostonnais! À\nbas les voleurs!”\n\n“Damn such monkey talk,” said Cowan, facing them suddenly. I knew him\nwell, and when the giant lost his temper it was gone irrevocably until a\nfight was over. “Call a man a squar’ name.”\n\n“Hey, Frenchy,” another of our men put in, stalking up to the clerk, “I\nreckon this here store’s ourn, ef we’ve a mind to tek it. I ‘low you’ll\ngive us the rum and the ‘baccy. Come on, boys!”\n\nIn between him and the clerk leaped a little, robin-like man with a red\nwaistcoat, beside himself with rage. Bill Cowan and his friends stared\nat this diminutive Frenchman, open-mouthed, as he poured forth a\nveritable torrent of unintelligible words, plentifully mixed with\nsacrés, which he ripped out like snarls. I would as soon have touched\nhim as a ball of angry bees or a pair of fighting wildcats. Not so Bill\nCowan. When that worthy recovered from his first surprise he seized hold\nof some of the man’s twisting arms and legs and lifted him bodily from\nthe ground, as he would have taken a perverse and struggling child.\nThere was no question of a fight. Cowan picked him up, I say, and before\nany one knew what happened, he flung him on to the hot roof of the store\n(the eaves were but two feet above his head), and there the man stuck,\nclinging to a loose shingle, purpling and coughing and spitting with\nrage. There was a loud gust of guffaws from the woodsmen, and oaths\nlike whip-cracks from the circle around us, menacing growls as it surged\ninward and our men turned to face it. A few citizens pushed through the\noutskirts of it and ran away, and in the hush that followed we heard\nthem calling wildly the names of Father Gibault and Clark and of Vigo\nhimself. Cowan thrust me past the clerk into the store, where I stood\nlistening to the little man on the roof, scratching and clutching at the\nshingles, and coughing still.\n\nBut there was no fight. Shouts of “Monsieur Vigo! Voici Monsieur Vigo!”\nwere heard, the crowd parted respectfully, and Monsieur Vigo in his\nsnuff-colored suit stood glancing from Cowan to his pallid clerk. He was\nnot in the least excited.\n\n“Come in, my frens,” he said; “it is too hot in the sun.” And he set\nthe example by stepping over the sill on to the hard-baked earth of the\nfloor within. Then he spied me. “Ah,” he said, “the boy of Monsieur le\nColonel! And how are you called, my son?” he added, patting me kindly.\n\n“Davy, sir,” I answered.\n\n“Ha,” he said, “and a brave soldier, no doubt.”\n\nI was flattered as well as astonished by this attention. But Monsieur\nVigo knew men, and he had given them time to turn around. By this time\nBill Cowan and some of my friends had stooped through the doorway,\nfollowed by a prying Kaskaskian brave and as many Creoles as could crowd\nbehind them. Monsieur Vigo was surprisingly calm.\n\n“It make hot weather, my frens,” said he. “How can I serve you,\nmessieurs?”\n\n“Hain’t the Congress got authority here?” said one.\n\n“I am happy to say,” answered Monsieur Vigo, rubbing his hands, “for I\nthink much of your principle.”\n\n“Then,” said the man, “we come here to trade with Congress money. Hain’t\nthat money good in Kaskasky?”\n\nThere was an anxious pause. Then Monsieur Vigo’s eyes twinkled, and he\nlooked at me.\n\n“And what you say, Davy?” he asked.\n\n“The money would be good if you took it, sir,” I said, not knowing what\nelse to answer.\n\n“Sapristi!” exclaimed Monsieur Vigo, looking hard at me. “Who teach you\nthat?”\n\n“No one, sir,” said I, staring in my turn.\n\n“And if Congress lose, and not pay, where am I, mon petit maître de\nla haute finance?” demanded Monsieur Vigo, with the palms of his hands\noutward.\n\n“You will be in good company, sir,” said I.\n\nAt that he threw back his head and laughed, and Bill Cowan and my\nfriends laughed with him.\n\n“Good company--c’est la plupart de la vie,” said Monsieur Vigo. “Et quel\ngarçon--what a boy it is!”\n\n“I never seed his beat fer wisdom, Mister Vigo,” said Bill Cowan, now in\ngood humor once more at the prospect of rum and tobacco. And I found out\nlater that he and the others had actually given to me the credit of\nthis coup. “He never failed us yet. Hain’t that truth, boys? Hain’t we\na-goin’ on to St. Vincent because he seen the Ha’r Buyer sculped on the\nOhio?”\n\nThe rest assented so heartily but withal so gravely, that I am between\nlaughter and tears over the remembrance of it.\n\n“At noon you come back,” said Monsieur Vigo. “I think till then about\nrate of exchange, and talk with your Colonel. Davy, you stay here.”\n\nI remained, while the others filed out, and at length I was alone with\nhim and Jules, his clerk.\n\n“Davy, how you like to be trader?” asked Monsieur Vigo.\n\nIt was a new thought to me, and I turned it over in my mind. To see the\nstrange places of the world, and the stranger people; to become a man of\nwealth and influence such as Monsieur Vigo; and (I fear I loved it\nbest) to match my brains with others at a bargain,--I turned it all over\nslowly, gravely, in my boyish mind, rubbing the hard dirt on the floor\nwith the toe of my moccasin. And suddenly the thought came to me that I\nwas a traitor to my friends, a deserter from the little army that loved\nme so well.\n\n“Eh bien?” said Monsieur Vigo.\n\nI shook my head, but in spite of me I felt the tears welling into my\neyes and brushed them away shamefully. At such times of stress some of\nmy paternal Scotch crept into my speech.\n\n“I will no be leaving Colonel Clark and the boys,” I cried, “not for all\nthe money in the world.”\n\n“Congress money?” said Monsieur Vigo, with a queer expression.\n\nIt was then I laughed through my tears, and that cemented the friendship\nbetween us. It was a lifelong friendship, though I little suspected it\nthen.\n\nIn the days that followed he never met me on the street that he did not\nstop to pass the time of day, and ask me if I had changed my mind. He\ncame every morning to headquarters, where he and Colonel Clark sat by\nthe hour with brows knit. Monsieur Vigo was as good as his word, and\ntook the Congress money, though not at such a value as many would have\nhad him. I have often thought that we were all children then, and knew\nnothing of the ingratitude of republics. Monsieur Vigo took the money,\nand was all his life many, many thousand dollars the poorer. Father\nGibault advanced his little store, and lived to feel the pangs of want.\nAnd Colonel Clark? But I must not go beyond the troubles of that summer,\nand the problems that vexed our commander. One night I missed him from\nthe room where we slept, and walking into the orchard found him pacing\nthere, where the moon cast filmy shadows on the grass. By day as he went\naround among the men his brow was unclouded, though his face was stern.\nBut now I surprised the man so strangely moved that I yearned to comfort\nhim. He had taken three turns before he perceived me.\n\n“Davy,” he said, “what are you doing here?”\n\n“I missed you, sir,” I answered, staring at the furrows in his face.\n\n“Come!” he said almost roughly, and seizing my hand, led me back and\nforth swiftly through the wet grass for I know not how long. The moon\ndipped to the uneven line of the ridge-pole and slipped behind the stone\nchimney. All at once he stopped, dropped my hand, and smote both of his\ntogether.\n\n“I will hold on, by the eternal!” he cried. “I will let no American read\nhis history and say that I abandoned this land. Let them desert! If ten\nmen be found who will stay, I will hold the place for the Republic.”\n\n“Will not Virginia and the Congress send you men, sir?” I asked\nwonderingly.\n\nHe laughed a laugh that was all bitterness.\n\n“Virginia and the Continental Congress know little and care less about\nme,” he answered. “Some day you will learn that foresight sometimes\ncomes to men, but never to assemblies. But it is often given to one man\nto work out the salvation of a people, and be destroyed for it. Davy, we\nhave been up too long.”\n\nAt the morning parade, from my wonted place at the end of the line, I\nwatched him with astonishment, reviewing the troops as usual. For the\nvery first day I had crossed the river with Terence, climbed the heights\nto the old fort, and returned with my drum. But no sooner had I\nbeaten the retreat than the men gathered here and there in groups that\nsmouldered with mutiny, and I noted that some of the officers were\namongst these. Once in a while a sentence like a flaming brand was\nflung out. Their time was up, their wives and children for all they knew\nsculped by the red varmints, and, by the etarnal, Clark or no man living\ncould keep them.\n\n“Hi,” said one, as I passed, “here’s Davy with his drum. He’ll be\nleadin’ us back to Kaintuck in the morning.”\n\n“Ay, ay,” cried another man in the group, “I reckon he’s had his full of\ntyranny, too.”\n\nI stopped, my face blazing red.\n\n“Shame on you for those words!” I shouted shrilly. “Shame on you, you\nfools, to desert the man who would save your wives and children. How are\nthe redskins to be beaten if they are not cowed in their own country?”\nFor I had learned much at headquarters.\n\nThey stood silent, astonished, no doubt, at the sight of my small figure\na-tremble with anger. I heard Bill Cowan’s voice behind me.\n\n“There’s truth for ye,” he said, “that will slink home when a thing’s\nhalf done.”\n\n“Ye needn’t talk, Bill Cowan; it’s well enough for ye. I reckon your\nwife’d scare any redskin off her clearin’.”\n\n“Many the time she scart me,” said Bill Cowan.\n\nAnd so the matter went by with a laugh. But the grumbling continued, and\nthe danger was that the French would learn of it. The day passed, yet\nthe embers blazed not into the flame of open mutiny. But he who has seen\nservice knows how ominous is the gathering of men here and there,\nthe low humming talk, the silence when a dissenter passes. There were\nfights, too, that had to be quelled by company captains, and no man knew\nwhen the loud quarrel between the two races at Vigo’s store would grow\ninto an ugly battle.\n\nWhat did Clark intend to do? This was the question that hung in the\nminds of mutineer and faithful alike. They knew the desperation of his\ncase. Without money, save that which the generous Creoles had advanced\nupon his personal credit; without apparent resources; without authority,\nsave that which the weight of his character exerted,--how could he\nprevent desertion? They eyed him as he went from place to place about\nhis business,--erect, thoughtful, undisturbed. Few men dare to set their\nwill against a multitude when there are no fruits to be won. Columbus\npersisted, and found a new world; Clark persisted, and won an empire for\nthoughtless generations to enjoy.\n\nThat night he slept not at all, but sat, while the candles flickered in\ntheir sockets, poring over maps and papers. I dared not disturb him, but\nlay the darkness through with staring eyes. And when the windows on the\norchard side showed a gray square of light, he flung down the parchment\nhe was reading on the table. It rolled up of itself, and he pushed back\nhis chair. I heard him call my name, and leaping out of bed, I stood\nbefore him.\n\n“You sleep lightly, Davy,” he said, I think to try me.\n\nI did not answer, fearing to tell him that I had been awake watching\nhim.\n\n“I have one friend, at least,” said the Colonel.\n\n“You have many, sir,” I answered, “as you will find when the time\ncomes.”\n\n“The time has come,” said he; “to-day I shall be able to count them.\nDavy, I want you to do something for me.”\n\n“Now, sir?” I answered, overjoyed.\n\n“As soon as the sun strikes that orchard,” he said, pointing out of the\nwindow. “You have learned how to keep things to yourself. Now I want you\nto impart them to others. Go out, and tell the village that I am going\naway.”\n\n“That you are going away, sir?” I repeated.\n\n“That I am going away,” he said, “with my army, (save the mark!), with\nmy army and my drummer boy and my paper money. Such is my faith in the\nloyalty of the good people of these villages to the American cause, that\nI can safely leave the flag flying over their heads with the assurance\nthat they will protect it.”\n\nI stared at him doubtfully, for at times a pleasantry came out of his\nbitterness.\n\n“Ay,” he said, “go! Have you any love for me?”\n\n“I have, sir,” I answered.\n\n“By the Lord, I believe you,” he said, and picking up my small hunting\nshirt, he flung it at me. “Put it on, and go when the sun rises.”\n\nAs the first shaft of light over the bluff revealed the diamonds in the\norchard grass I went out, wondering. Suspecting would be a better word\nfor the nature I had inherited. But I had my orders. Terence was pacing\nthe garden, his leggings turned black with the dew. I looked at him.\nHere was a vessel to disseminate.\n\n“Terence, the Colonel is going back to Virginia with the army.”\n\n“Him!” cried Terence, dropping the stock of his Deckard to the ground.\n“And back to Kaintuckee! Arrah, ‘tis a sin to be jokin’ before a man has\na bit in his sthummick. Bad cess to yere plisantry before breakfast.”\n\n“I’m telling you what the Colonel himself told me,” I answered, and\nran on. “Davy, darlin’!” I heard him calling after me as I turned the\ncorner, but I looked not back.\n\nThere was a single sound in the street. A thin, bronzed Indian lad\nsquatted against the pickets with his fingers on a reed, his cheeks\ndistended. He broke off with a wild, mournful note to stare at me. A\nwisp of smoke stole from a stone chimney, and the smell that corn-pone\nand bacon leave was in the air. A bolt was slammed back, a door creaked\nand stuck, was flung open, and with a “Va t’en, méchant!” a cotton-clad\nurchin was cast out of the house, and fled into the dusty street.\nBreathing the morning air in the doorway, stood a young woman in a\ncotton gown, a saucepan in hand. She had inquisitive eyes, a pointed,\nprying nose, and I knew her to be the village gossip, the wife of Jules,\nMonsieur Vigo’s clerk. She had the same smattering of English as her\nhusband. Now she stood regarding me narrowly between half-closed lids.\n\n“A la bonne heure! Que fais-tu donc? What do you do so early?”\n\n“The garrison is getting ready to leave for Kentucky to-day,” I\nanswered.\n\n“Ha! Jules! Écoute-toi! Nom de dieu! Is it true what you say?”\n\nThe visage of Jules, surmounted by a nightcap and heavy with sleep,\nappeared behind her.\n\n“Ha, e’est Daveed!” he said. “What news have you?”\n\nI repeated, whereupon they both began to lament.\n\n“And why is it?” persisted Jules.\n\n“He has such faith in the loyalty of the Kaskaskians,” I answered,\nparrot-like.\n\n“Diable!” cried Jules, “we shall perish. We shall be as the Acadians.\nAnd loyalty--she will not save us, no.”\n\nOther doors creaked. Other inhabitants came in varied costumes into the\nstreet to hear the news, lamenting. If Clark left, the day of judgment\nwas at hand for them, that was certain. Between the savage and the\nBriton not one stone would be left standing on another. Madame Jules\nforgot her breakfast, and fled up the street with the tidings. And\nthen I made my way to the fort, where the men were gathering about the\ncamp-fires, talking excitedly. Terence, relieved from duty, had done the\nwork here.\n\n“And he as little as a fox, wid all that in him,” he cried, when he\nperceived me walking demurely past the sentry. “Davy, dear, come here\nan’ tell the b’ys am I a liar.”\n\n“Davy’s monstrous cute,” said Bill Cowan; “I reckon he knows as well as\nme the Colonel hain’t a-goin’ to do no such tomfool thing as leave.”\n\n“He is,” I cried, for the benefit of some others, “he’s fair sick of\ngrumblers that haven’t got the grit to stand by him in trouble.”\n\n“By the Lord!” said Bill Cowan, “and I’ll not blame him.” He turned\nfiercely, his face reddening. “Shame on ye all yere lives,” he shouted.\n“Ye’re making the best man that ever led a regiment take the back trail.\nYe’ll fetch back to Kaintuck, and draw every redskin in the north woods\nsuckin’ after ye like leaves in a harricane wind. There hain’t a man of\nye has the pluck of this little shaver that beats the drum. I wish to\nGod McChesney was here.”\n\nHe turned away to cross the parade ground, followed by the faithful\nTerence and myself. Others gathered about him: McAndrew, who, for all\nhis sourness, was true; Swein Poulsson, who would have died for the\nColonel; John Duff, and some twenty more, including Saunders, whose\naffection had not been killed, though Clark had nearly hanged him among\nthe prairies.\n\n“Begob!” said Terence, “Davy has inflooence wid his Excellency. It’s\nDavy we’ll sind, prayin’ him not to lave the Frinch alone wid their\nloyalty.”\n\nIt was agreed, and I was to repeat the name of every man that sent me.\n\nDeparting on this embassy, I sped out of the gates of the fort. But, as\nI approached the little house where Clark lived, the humming of a\ncrowd came to my ears, and I saw with astonishment that the street was\nblocked. It appeared that the whole of the inhabitants of Kaskaskia were\npacked in front of the place. Wriggling my way through the people, I had\nbarely reached the gate when I saw Monsieur Vigo and the priest, three\nCreole gentlemen in uniform, and several others coming out of the door.\nThey stopped, and Monsieur Vigo, raising his hand for silence, made a\nspeech in French to the people. What he said I could not understand,\nand when he had finished they broke up into groups, and many of them\ndeparted. Before I could gain the house, Colonel Clark himself came\nout with Captain Helm and Captain Harrod. The Colonel glanced at me and\nsmiled.\n\n“Parade, Davy,” he said, and walked on.\n\nI ran back to the fort, and when I had gotten my drum the three\ncompanies were falling into line, the men murmuring in undertones among\nthemselves. They were brought to attention. Colonel Clark was seen to\ncome out of the commandant’s house, and we watched him furtively as he\nwalked slowly to his place in front of the line. A tremor of excitement\nwent from sergeant to drummer boy. The sentries closed the big gates of\nthe fort.\n\nThe Colonel stood for a full minute surveying us calmly,--a disquieting\nway he had when matters were at a crisis. Then he began to talk.\n\n“I have heard from many sources that you are dissatisfied, that you wish\nto go back to Kentucky. If that be so, I say to you, ‘Go, and God be\nwith you.’ I will hinder no man. We have taken a brave and generous\npeople into the fold of the Republic, and they have shown their\npatriotism by giving us freely of their money and stores.” He raised his\nvoice. “They have given the last proof of that patriotism this day.\nYes, they have come to me and offered to take your places, to finish\nthe campaign which you have so well begun and wish to abandon. To-day I\nshall enroll their militia under the flag for which you have fought.”\n\nWhen he had ceased speaking a murmur ran through the ranks.\n\n“But if there be any,” he said, “who have faith in me and in the cause\nfor which we have come here, who have the perseverance and the courage\nto remain, I will reënlist them. The rest of you shall march for\nKentucky,” he cried, “as soon as Captain Bowman’s company can be\nrelieved at Cahokia. The regiment is dismissed.”\n\nFor a moment they remained in ranks, as though stupefied. It was Cowan\nwho stepped out first, snatched his coonskin hat from his head, and\nwaved it in the air.\n\n“Huzzay for Colonel Clark!” he roared. “I’ll foller him into Canady, and\nstand up to my lick log.”\n\nThey surrounded Bill Cowan, not the twenty which had flocked to him in\nthe morning, but four times twenty, and they marched in a body to the\ncommandant’s house to be reënlisted. The Colonel stood by the door,\nand there came a light in his eyes as he regarded us. They cheered him\nagain.\n\n“Thank you, lads,” he said; “remember, we may have to whistle for our\npay.”\n\n“Damn the pay!” cried Bill Cowan, and we echoed the sentiment.\n\n“We’ll see what can be done about land grants,” said the Colonel, and he\nturned away.\n\nAt dusk that evening I sat on the back door-step, by the orchard,\ncleaning his rifle. The sound of steps came from the little passage\nbehind me, and a hand was on my head.\n\n“Davee,” said a voice (it was Monsieur Vigo’s), “do you know what is un\ncoup d’état?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“Ha! You execute one to-day. Is it not so, Monsieur le Colonel?”\n\n“I reckon he was in the secret,” said Colonel Clark. “Did you think I\nmeant to leave Kaskaskia, Davy?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“He is not so easy fool,” Monsieur Vigo put in. “He tell me paper money\ngood if I take it. C’est la haute finance!”\n\nColonel Clark laughed.\n\n“And why didn’t you think I meant to leave?” said he.\n\n“Because you bade me go out and tell everybody,” I answered. “What you\nreally mean to do you tell no one.”\n\n“Nom du bon Dieu!” exclaimed Monsieur Vigo.\n\nYesterday Colonel Clark had stood alone, the enterprise for which he had\nrisked all on the verge of failure. By a master-stroke his ranks were\nrepleted, his position recovered, his authority secured once more.\n\nFew men recognize genius when they see it. Monsieur Vigo was not one of\nthese.\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. DAVY GOES TO CAHOKIA\n\nI should make but a poor historian, for I have not stuck to my\nchronology. But as I write, the vivid recollections are those that I\nset down. I have forgotten two things of great importance. First, the\ndeparture of Father Gibault with several Creole gentlemen and a spy of\nColonel Clark’s for Vincennes, and their triumphant return in August.\nThe sacrifice of the good priest had not been in vain, and he came back\nwith the joyous news of a peaceful conquest. The stars and stripes now\nwaved over the fort, and the French themselves had put it there. And the\nvast stretch of country from that place westward to the Father of Waters\nwas now American.\n\nAnd that brings me to the second oversight. The surprise and conquest of\nCahokia by Bowman and his men was like that of Kaskaskia. And the French\nthere were loyal, too, offering their militia for service in the place\nof those men of Bowman’s company who would not reënlist. These came to\nKaskaskia to join our home-goers, and no sooner had the hundred marched\nout of the gate and taken up their way for Kentucky than Colonel Clark\nbegan the drilling of the new troops.\n\nCaptain Leonard Helm was sent to take charge of Vincennes, and Captain\nMontgomery set out across the mountains for Williamsburg with letters\npraying the governor of Virginia to come to our assistance.\n\nFor another cloud had risen in the horizon: another problem for Clark\nto face of greater portent than all the others. A messenger from Captain\nBowman at Cohos came riding down the street on a scraggly French pony,\nand pulled up before headquarters. The messenger was Sergeant Thomas\nMcChesney, and his long legs almost reached the ground on either side of\nthe little beast. Leaping from the saddle, he seized me in his arms, set\nme down, and bade me tell Colonel Clark of his arrival.\n\nIt was a sultry August morning. Within the hour Colonel Clark and Tom\nand myself were riding over the dusty trace that wound westward across\nthe common lands of the village, which was known as the Fort Chartres\nroad. The heat-haze shimmered in the distance, and there was no sound in\nplain or village save the tinkle of a cowbell from the clumps of shade.\nColonel Clark rode twenty paces in front, alone, his head bowed with\nthinking.\n\n“They’re coming into Cahokia as thick as bees out’n a gum, Davy,” said\nTom; “seems like there’s thousands of ‘em. Nothin’ will do ‘em but they\nmust see the Colonel,--the varmints. And they’ve got patience, they’ll\nwait thar till the b’ars git fat. I reckon they ‘low Clark’s got\nthe armies of Congress behind him. If they knowed,” said Tom, with a\nchuckle, “if they knowed that we’d only got seventy of the boys and some\nhundred Frenchies in the army! I reckon the Colonel’s too cute for ‘em.”\n\nThe savages in Cahokia were as the leaves of the forest. Curiosity,\nthat mainspring of the Indian character, had brought the chiefs, big and\nlittle, to see with their own eyes the great Captain of the Long Knives.\nIn vain had the faithful Bowman put them off. They would wait. Clark\nmust come. And Clark was coming, for he was not the man to quail at such\na crisis. For the crux of the whole matter was here. And if he failed to\nimpress them with his power, with the might of the Congress for which he\nfought, no man of his would ever see Kentucky again.\n\nAs we rode through the bottom under the pecan trees we talked of Polly\nAnn, Tom and I, and of our little home by the Salt River far to the\nsouthward, where we would live in peace when the campaign was over. Tom\nhad written her, painfully enough, an affectionate scrawl, which he sent\nby one of Captain Linn’s men. And I, too, had written. My letter had\nbeen about Tom, and how he had become a sergeant, and what a favorite\nhe was with Bowman and the Colonel. Poor Polly Ann! She could not write,\nbut a runner from Harrodstown who was a friend of Tom’s had carried\nall the way to Cahokia, in the pocket with his despatches, a fold of\nnettle-bark linen. Tom pulled it from the bosom of his hunting shirt to\nshow me, and in it was a little ring of hair like unto the finest spun\nred-gold. This was the message Polly Ann had sent,--a message from\nlittle Tom as well.\n\nAt Prairie du Rocher, at St. Philippe, the inhabitants lined the streets\nto do homage to this man of strange power who rode, unattended and\nunafraid, to the council of the savage tribes which had terrorized his\npeople of Kentucky. From the ramparts of Fort Chartres (once one of the\nmighty chain of strongholds to protect a new France, and now deserted\nlike Massacre), I gazed for the first time in awe at the turgid flood of\nthe Mississippi, and at the lands of the Spanish king beyond. With never\nceasing fury the river tore at his clay banks and worried the green\nislands that braved his charge. And my boyish fancy pictured to itself\nthe monsters which might lie hidden in his muddy depths.\n\nWe lay that night in the open at a spring on the bluffs, and the next\nmorning beheld the church tower of Cahokia. A little way from the town\nwe perceived an odd gathering on the road, the yellowed and weathered\nhunting shirts of Bowman’s company mixed with the motley dress of the\nCreole volunteers. Some of these gentlemen wore the costume of coureurs\ndu bois, others had odd regimental coats and hats which had seen much\nservice. Besides the military was a sober deputation of citizens, and\nhovering behind the whole a horde of curious, blanketed braves, come to\nget a first glimpse of the great white captain. So escorted, we crossed\nat the mill, came to a shady street that faced the little river, and\nstopped at the stone house where Colonel Clark was to abide.\n\nOn that day, and for many days more, that street was thronged with\nwarriors. Chiefs in gala dress strutted up and down, feathered\nand plumed and blanketed, smeared with paint, bedecked with rude\njewellery,--earrings and bracelets. From the remote forests of the north\nthey had come, where the cold winds blow off the blue lakes; from\nthe prairies to the east; from the upper running waters, where the\nMississippi flows clear and undefiled by the muddy flood; from the\nvillages and wigwams of the sluggish Wabash; and from the sandy, piny\ncountry between the great northern seas where Michilimackinac stands\nguard alone,--Sacs and Foxes, Chippeways and Maumies and Missesogies,\nPuans and Pottawattomies, chiefs and medicine men.\n\nWell might the sleep of the good citizens be disturbed, and the women\nfear to venture to the creek with their linen and their paddles!\n\nThe lives of these people hung in truth upon a slender thing--the\nbearing of one man. All day long the great chiefs sought an audience\nwith him, but he sent them word that matters would be settled in the\ncouncil that was to come. All day long the warriors lined the picket\nfence in front of the house, and more than once Tom McChesney roughly\nshouldered a lane through them that timid visitors might pass. Like a\npack of wolves, they watched narrowly for any sign of weakness. As for\nTom, they were to him as so many dogs.\n\n“Ye varmints!” he cried, “I’ll take a blizz’rd at ye if ye don’t keep\nthe way clear.”\n\nAt that they would give back grudgingly with a chorus of grunts, only to\nclose in again as tightly as before. But they came to have a wholesome\nregard for the sun-browned man with the red hair who guarded the\nColonel’s privacy. The boy who sat on the door-step, the son of the\ngreat Pale Face Chief (as they called me), was a never ending source\nof comment among them. Once Colonel Clark sent for me. The little front\nroom of this house was not unlike the one we had occupied at Kaskaskia.\nIt had bare walls, a plain table and chairs, and a crucifix in the\ncorner. It served as dining room, parlor, bedroom, for there was a\npallet too. Now the table was covered with parchments and papers, and\nbeside Colonel Clark sat a grave gentleman of about his own age. As I\ncame into the room Colonel Clark relaxed, turned toward this gentleman,\nand said:--\n\n“Monsieur Gratiot, behold my commissary-general, my strategist, my\nfinancier.” And Monsieur Gratiot smiled. He struck me as a man who never\nlet himself go sufficiently to laugh.\n\n“Ah,” he said, “Vigo has told me how he settled the question of paper\nmoney. He might do something for the Congress in the East.”\n\n“Davy is a Scotchman, like John Law,” said the Colonel, “and he is a\nmaster at perceiving a man’s character and business.”\n\n“What would you call me, at a venture, Davy?” asked Monsieur Gratiot.\n\nHe spoke excellent English, with only a slight accent.\n\n“A citizen of the world, like Monsieur Vigo,” I answered at a hazard.\n\n“Pardieu!” said Monsieur Gratiot, “you are not far away. Like Monsieur\nVigo I keep a store here at Cahokia. Like Monsieur Vigo, I have\ntravelled much in my day. Do you know where Switzerland is, Davy?”\n\nI did not.\n\n“It is a country set like a cluster of jewels in the heart of Europe,”\n said Monsieur Gratiot, “and there are mountains there that rise amon the\nclouds and are covered with perpetual snows. And when the sun sets on\nthose snows they are rubies, and the skies above them sapphire.”\n\n“I was born amongst the mountains, sir,” I answered, my pulse quickening\nat his description, “but they were not so high as those you speak of.”\n\n“Then,” said Monsieur Gratiot, “you can understand a little my sorrow\nas a lad when I left it. From Switzerland I went to a foggy place called\nLondon, and thence I crossed the ocean to the solemn forests of the\nnorth of Canada, where I was many years, learning the characters of\nthese gentlemen who are looking in upon us.” And he waved his arm at\nthe line of peering red faces by the pickets. Monsieur Gratiot smiled\nat Clark. “And there’s another point of resemblance between myself and\nMonsieur Vigo.”\n\n“Have you taken the paper money?” I demanded.\n\nMonsieur Gratiot slapped his linen breeches. “That I have,” and this\ntime I thought he was going to laugh. But he did not, though his eyes\nsparkled. “And do you think that the good Congress will ever repay me,\nDavy?”\n\n“No, sir,” said I.\n\n“Peste!” exclaimed Monsieur Gratiot, but he did not seem to be offended\nor shaken.\n\n“Davy,” said Colonel Clark, “we have had enough of predictions fo the\npresent. Fetch this letter to Captain Bowman at the garrison up the\nstreet.” He handed me the letter. “Are you afraid of the Indians?”\n\n“If I were, sir, I would not show it,” I said, for he had encouraged me\nto talk freely to him.\n\n“Avast!” cried the Colonel, as I was going out. “And why not?”\n\n“If I show that I am not afraid of them, sir, they will think that you\nare the less so.”\n\n“There you are for strategy, Gratiot,” said Colonel Clark, laughing.\n“Get out, you rascal.”\n\nTom was more concerned when I appeared.\n\n“Don’t pester ‘em, Davy,” said he; “fer God’s sake don’t pester ‘em.\nThey’re spoilin’ fer a fight. Stand back thar, ye critters,” he shouted,\nbrandishing his rifle in their faces. “Ugh, I reckon it wouldn’t take a\nhorse or a dog to scent ye to-day. Rank b’ar’s oil! Kite along, Davy.”\n\nClutching the letter tightly, I slipped between the narrowed ranks,\nand gained the middle of the street, not without a quickened beat of my\nheart. Thence I sped, dodging this group and that, until I came to\nthe long log house that was called the garrison. Here our men were\nstationed, where formerly a squad from an English regiment was\nquartered. I found Captain Bowman, delivered the letter, and started\nback again through the brown, dusty street, which lay in the shade of\nthe great forest trees that still lined it, doubling now and again\nto avoid an idling brave that looked bent upon mischief. For a single\nmischance might set the tide running to massacre.\n\nI was nearing the gate again, the dust flying from my moccasined feet,\nthe sight of the stalwart Tom giving me courage again. Suddenly, with\nthe deftness of a panther, an Indian shot forward and lifted me high\nin his arms. To this day I recall my terror as I dangled in mid-air,\nstaring into a hideous face. By intuition I kicked him in the stomach\nwith all my might, and with a howl of surprise and rage his fingers\ngripped into my flesh. The next thing I remember was being in the dust,\nsuffocated by that odor which he who has known it can never forget.\nA medley of discordant cries was in my ears. Then I was snatched up,\nbumped against heads and shoulders, and deposited somewhere. Now it was\nTom’s face that was close to mine, and the light of a fierce anger was\nin his blue eyes.\n\n“Did they hurt ye, Davy?” he asked.\n\nI shook my head. Before I could speak he was at the gate again,\nconfronting the mob of savages that swayed against the fence, and the\nstreet was filled with running figures. A voice of command that I knew\nwell came from behind me. It was Colonel Clark’s.\n\n“Stay where you are, McChesney!” he shouted, and Tom halted with his\nhand on the latch.\n\n“With your permission, I will speak to them,” said Monsieur Gratiot, who\nhad come out also.\n\nI looked up at him, and he was as calm as when he had joked with me a\nquarter of an hour since.\n\n“Very well,” said Clark, briefly.\n\nMonsieur Gratiot surveyed them scornfully.\n\n“Where is the Hungry Wolf, who speaks English?” he said.\n\nThere was a stir in the rear ranks, and a lean savage with abnormal\ncheek bones pushed forward.\n\n“Hungry Wolf here,” he said with a grunt.\n\n“The Hungry Wolf knew the French trader at Michilimackinac,” said\nMonsieur Gratiot. “He knows that the French trader’s word is a true\nword. Let the Hungry Wolf tell his companions that the Chief of the Long\nKnives is very angry.”\n\nThe Hungry Wolf turned, and began to speak. His words, hoarse and\nresonant, seemed to come from the depths of his body. Presently he\npaused, and there came an answer from the fiend who had seized me. After\nthat there were many grunts, and the Hungry Wolf turned again.\n\n“The North Wind mean no harm,” he answered. “He play with the son of\nthe Great White Chief, and his belly is very sore where the Chief’s son\nkicked him.”\n\n“The Chief of the Long Knives will consider the offence,” said Monsieur\nGratiot, and retired into the house with Colonel Clark. For a full\nfive minutes the Indians waited, impassive. And then Monsieur Gratiot\nreappeared, alone.\n\n“The Chief of the Long Knives is mercifully inclined to forgive,” he\nsaid. “It was in play. But there must be no more play with the Chief’s\nson. And the path to the Great Chief’s presence must be kept clear.”\n\nAgain the Hungry Wolf translated. The North Wind grunted and departed in\nsilence, followed by many of his friends. And indeed for a while after\nthat the others kept a passage clear to the gate.\n\nAs for the son of the Great White Chief, he sat for a long time that\nafternoon beside the truck patch of the house. And presently he slipped\nout by a byway into the street again, among the savages. His heart was\nbumping in his throat, but a boyish reasoning told him that he must show\nno fear. And that day he found what his Colonel had long since learned\nto be true--that in courage is the greater safety. The power of the\nGreat White Chief was such that he allowed his son to go forth alone,\nand feared not for his life. Even so Clark himself walked among them,\nnor looked to right or left.\n\nTwo nights Colonel Clark sat through, calling now on this man and now\non that, and conning the treaties which the English had made with the\nvarious tribes--ay, and French and Spanish treaties too--until he knew\nthem all by heart. There was no haste in what he did, no uneasiness\nin his manner. He listened to the advice of Monsieur Gratiot and other\nCreole gentlemen of weight, to the Spanish officers who came in their\nregimentals from St. Louis out of curiosity to see how this man would\ntreat with the tribes. For he spoke of his intentions to none of them,\nand gained the more respect by it. Within the week the council began;\nand the scene of the great drama was a field near the village, the\nbackground of forest trees. Few plays on the world’s stage have held\nsuch suspense, few battles such excitement for those who watched. Here\nwas the spectacle of one strong man’s brain pitted against the combined\ncraft of the wilderness. In the midst of a stretch of waving grass was\na table, and a young man of six-and-twenty sat there alone. Around\nhim were ringed the gathered tribes, each chief in the order of his\nimportance squatted in the inner circle, their blankets making patches\nof bright color against the green. Behind the tribes was the little\ngroup of hunting shirts, the men leaning on the barrels of their long\nrifles, indolent but watchful. Here and there a gay uniform of a Spanish\nor Creole officer, and behind these all the population of the village\nthat dared to show itself.\n\nThe ceremonies began with the kindling of the council fire,--a rite\nhanded down through unknown centuries of Indian usage. By it nations had\nbeen made and unmade, broad lands passed, even as they now might pass.\nThe yellow of its crackling flames was shamed by the summer sun, and the\nblack smoke of it was wafted by the south wind over the forest. Then for\nthree days the chiefs spoke, and a man listened, unmoved. The sound of\nthese orations, wild and fearful to my boyish ear, comes back to me now.\nYet there was a cadence in it, a music of notes now falling, now rising\nto a passion and intensity that thrilled us.\n\nBad birds flying through the land (the British agents) had besought them\nto take up the bloody hatchet. They had sinned. They had listened to\nthe lies which the bad birds had told of the Big Knives, they had taken\ntheir presents. But now the Great Spirit in His wisdom had brought\nthemselves and the Chief of the Big Knives together. Therefore (suiting\nthe action to the word) they stamped on the bloody belt, and rent in\npieces the emblems of the White King across the water. So said the\ninterpreters, as the chiefs one after another tore the miniature British\nflags which had been given them into bits. On the evening of the third\nday the White Chief rose in his chair, gazing haughtily about him. There\nwas a deep silence.\n\n“Tell your chiefs,” he said, “tell your chiefs that to-morrow I will\ngive them an answer. And upon the manner in which they receive that\nanswer depends the fate of your nations. Good night.”\n\nThey rose and, thronging around him, sought to take his hand. But Clark\nturned from them.\n\n“Peace is not yet come,” he said sternly. “It is time to take the hand\nwhen the heart is given with it.”\n\nA feathered headsman of one of the tribes gave back with dignity and\nspoke.\n\n“It is well said by the Great Chief of the Pale Faces,” he answered;\n“these in truth are not the words of a man with a double tongue.”\n\nSo they sought their quarters for the night, and suspense hung\nbreathless over the village.\n\nThere were many callers at the stone house that evening,--Spanish\nofficers, Creole gentlemen, an English Canadian trader or two. With my\nelbow on the sill of the open window I watched them awhile, listening\nwith a boy’s eagerness to what they had to say of the day’s doings.\nThey disputed amongst themselves in various degrees of English as to the\nmanner of treating the red man,--now gesticulating, now threatening,\nnow seizing a rolled parchment treaty from the table. Clark sat alone, a\nlittle apart, silent save a word now and then in a low tone to Monsieur\nGratiot or Captain Bowman. Here was an odd assortment of the races which\nhad overrun the new world. At intervals some disputant would pause in\nhis talk to kill a mosquito or fight away a moth or a June-bug, but\npresently the argument reached such a pitch that the mosquitoes fed\nundisturbed.\n\n“You have done much, sir,” said the Spanish commandant of St. Louis,\n“but the savage, he will never be content without present. He will never\nbe won without present.”\n\nClark was one of those men who are perforce listened to when they begin\nto speak.\n\n“Captain de Leyba,” said he, “I know not what may be the present policy\nof his Spanish Majesty with McGillivray and his Creeks in the south, but\nthis I do believe,” and he brought down his fist among the papers, “that\nthe old French and Spanish treaties were right in principle. Here\nare copies of the English treaties that I have secured, and in them\nthousands of sovereigns have been thrown away. They are so much waste\npaper. Gentlemen, the Indians are children. If you give them presents,\nthey believe you to be afraid of them. I will deal with them without\npresents; and if I had the gold of the Bank of England stored in the\ngarrison there, they should not touch a piece of it.”\n\nBut Captain de Leyba, incredulous, raised his eyebrows and shrugged.\n\n“Por Dios,” he cried, “whoever hear of one man and fifty militia\nsubduing the northern tribes without a piastre?”\n\nAfter a while the Colonel called me in, and sent me speeding across the\nlittle river with a note to a certain Mr. Brady, whose house was not far\naway. Like many another citizen of Cahokia, Mr. Brady was terror-ridden.\nA party of young Puan bucks had decreed it to be their pleasure to\nencamp in Mr. Brady’s yard, to peer through the shutters into Mr.\nBrady’s house, to enjoy themselves by annoying Mr. Brady’s family and\nothers as much as possible. During the Indian occupation of Cahokia this\nband had gained a well-deserved reputation for mischief; and chief among\nthem was the North Wind himself, whom I had done the honor to kick\nin the stomach. To-night they had made a fire in this Mr. Brady’s\nflower-garden, over which they were cooking venison steaks. And, as I\nreached the door, the North Wind spied me, grinned, rubbed his stomach,\nmade a false dash at me that frightened me out of my wits, and finally\nwent through the pantomime of scalping me. I stood looking at him with\nmy legs apart, for the son of the Great Chief must not run away. And\nI marked that the North Wind had two great ornamental daubs like\nshutter-fastenings painted on his cheeks. I sniffed preparation, too,\non his followers, and I was sure they were getting ready for some new\ndeviltry. I handed the note to Mr. Brady through the crack of the door\nthat he vouchsafed to me, and when he had slammed and bolted me out, I\nran into the street and stood for some time behind the trunk of a big\nhickory, watching the followers of the North Wind. Some were painting\nthemselves, others cleaning their rifles and sharpening their scalping\nknives. All jabbered unceasingly. Now and again a silent brave passed,\npaused a moment to survey them gravely, grunted an answer to something\nthey would fling at him, and went on. At length arrived three chiefs\nwhom I knew to be high in the councils. The North Wind came out to them,\nand the four blanketed forms stood silhouetted between me and the fire\nfor a quarter of an hour. By this time I was sure of a plot, and fled\naway to another tree for fear of detection. At length stalked through\nthe street the Hungry Wolf, the interpreter. I knew this man to be\nfriendly to Clark, and I acted on impulse. He gave a grunt of surprise\nwhen I halted before him. I made up my mind.\n\n“The son of the Great Chief knows that the Puans have wickedness in\ntheir hearts to-night,” I said; “the tongue of the Hungry Wolf does not\nlie.”\n\nThe big Indian drew back with another grunt, and the distant firelight\nflashed on his eyes as on polished black flints.\n\n“Umrrhh! Is the Pale Face Chief’s son a prophet?”\n\n“The anger of the Pale Face Chief and of his countrymen is as the\nhurricane,” I said, scarce believing my own ears. For a lad is imitative\nby nature, and I had not listened to the interpreters for three days\nwithout profit.\n\nThe Hungry Wolf grunted again, after which he was silent for a long\ntime. Then he said:--\n\n“Let the Chief of the Long Knives have guard tonight.” And suddenly he\nwas gone into the darkness.\n\nI waded the creek and sped to Clark. He was alone now, the shutters of\nthe room closed. And as I came in I could scarce believe that he was\nthe same masterful man I had seen at the council that day, and at the\nconference an hour gone. He was once more the friend at whose feet I sat\nin private, who talked to me as a companion and a father.\n\n“Where have you been, Davy?” he asked. And then, “What is it, my lad?”\n\nI crept close to him and told him in a breathless undertone, and I\nknew that I was shaking the while. He listened gravely, and when I had\nfinished laid a firm hand on my head.\n\n“There,” he said, “you are a brave lad, and a canny.”\n\nHe thought a minute, his hand still resting on my head, and then rose\nand led me to the back door of the house. It was near midnight, and the\nsounds of the place were stilling, the crickets chirping in the grass.\n\n“Run to Captain Bowman and tell him to send ten men to this door. But\nthey must come man by man, to escape detection. Do you understand?” I\nnodded and was starting, but he still held me. “God bless you, Davy, you\nare a brave boy.”\n\nHe closed the door softly and I sped away, my moccasins making no\nsound on the soft dirt. I reached the garrison, was challenged by Jack\nTerrill, the guard, and brought by him to Bowman’s room. The Captain\nsat, undressed, at the edge of his bed. But he was a man of action, and\nstrode into the long room where his company was sleeping and gave his\norders without delay.\n\nHalf an hour later there was no light in the village. The Colonel’s\nheadquarters were dark, but in the kitchen a dozen tall men were\nwaiting.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. THE SACRIFICE\n\nSo far as the world knew, the Chief of the Long Knives slept peacefully\nin his house. And such was his sense of power that not even a sentry\npaced the street without. For by these things is the Indian mind\nimpressed. In the tiny kitchen a dozen men and a boy tried to hush their\nbreathing, and sweltered. For it was very hot, and the pent-up odor of\npast cookings was stifling to men used to the open. In a corner, hooded\nunder a box, was a lighted lantern, and Tom McChesney stood ready to\nseize it at the first alarm. On such occasions the current of time runs\nsluggish. Thrice our muscles were startled into tenseness by the baying\nof a hound, and once a cock crew out of all season. For the night was\ncloudy and pitchy black, and the dawn as far away as eternity.\n\nSuddenly I knew that every man in the room was on the alert, for the\nskilled frontiersman, when watchful, has a sixth sense. None of them\nmight have told you what he had heard. The next sound was the faint\ncreaking of Colonel Clark’s door as it opened. Wrapping a blanket around\nthe lantern, Tom led the way, and we massed ourselves behind the front\ndoor. Another breathing space, and then the war-cry of the Puans broke\nhideously on the night, and children woke, crying, from their sleep. In\ntwo bounds our little detachment was in the street, the fire spouting\nred from the Deckards, faint, shadowy forms fading along the line of\ntrees. After that an uproar of awakening, cries here and there, a drum\nbeating madly for the militia. The dozen flung themselves across the\nstream, I hot in their wake, through Mr. Brady’s gate, which was\nopen; and there was a scene of sweet tranquillity under the lantern’s\nrays,--the North Wind and his friends wrapped in their blankets and\nsleeping the sleep of the just.\n\n“Damn the sly varmints,” cried Tom, and he turned over the North Wind\nwith his foot, as a log.\n\nWith a grunt of fury the Indian shed his blanket and scrambled to his\nfeet, and stood glaring at us through his paint. But suddenly he met the\nfixed sternness of Clark’s gaze, and his own shifted. By this time his\nfollowers were up. The North Wind raised his hands to heaven in token of\nhis innocence, and then spread his palms outward. Where was the proof?\n\n“Look!” I cried, quivering with excitement; “look, their leggings and\nmoccasins are wet!”\n\n“There’s no devil if they beant!” said Tom, and there was a murmur of\napproval from the other men.\n\n“The boy is right,” said the Colonel, and turned to Tom. “Sergeant, have\nthe chiefs put in irons.” He swung on his heel, and without more ado\nwent back to his house to bed. The North Wind and two others were\neasily singled out as the leaders, and were straightway escorted to the\ngarrison house, their air of injured innocence availing them not a whit.\nThe militia was dismissed, and the village was hushed once more.\n\nBut all night long the chiefs went to and fro, taking counsel among\nthemselves. What would the Chief of the Pale Faces do?\n\nThe morning came with a cloudy, damp dawning. Within a decent time (for\nthe Indian is decorous) blanketed deputations filled the archways under\nthe trees and waited there as the minutes ran into hours. The Chief of\nthe Long Knives surveyed the morning from his door-step, and his eyes\nrested on a solemn figure at the gate. It was the Hungry Wolf. Sorrow\nwas in his voice, and he bore messages from the twenty great chiefs who\nstood beyond. They were come to express their abhorrence of the night’s\ndoings, of which they were as innocent as the deer of the forest.\n\n“Let the Hungry Wolf tell the chiefs,” said Colonel Clark, briefly,\n“that the council is the place for talk.” And he went back into the\nhouse again.\n\nThen he bade me run to Captain Bowman with an order to bring the North\nWind and his confederates to the council field in irons.\n\nThe day followed the promise of the dawn. The clouds hung low, and now\nand again great drops struck the faces of the people in the field. And\nlike the heavens, the assembly itself was charged with we knew not\nwhat. Was it peace or war? As before, a white man sat with supreme\nindifference at a table, and in front of him three most unhappy chiefs\nsquatted in the grass, the shame of their irons hidden under the blanket\nfolds. Audacity is truly a part of the equipment of genius. To have\nrescued the North Wind and his friends would have been child’s play; to\nhave retired from the council with threats of war, as easy.\n\nAnd yet they craved pardon.\n\nOne chief after another rose with dignity in the ring and came to the\ntable to plead. An argument deserving mention was that the North\nWind had desired to test the friendship of the French for the Big\nKnives,--set forth without a smile. To all pleaders Colonel Clark shook\nhis head. He, being a warrior, cared little whether such people were\nfriends or foes. He held them in the hollow of his hand. And at length\nthey came no more.\n\nThe very clouds seemed to hang motionless when he rose to speak, and you\nwho will may read in his memoir what he said. The Hungry Wolf caught the\nspirit of it, and was eloquent in his own tongue, and no word of it was\nlost. First he told them of the causes of war, of the thirteen council\nfires with the English, and in terms that the Indian mind might grasp,\nand how their old father, the French King, had joined the Big Knives in\nthis righteous fight.\n\n“Warriors,” said he, “here is a bloody belt and a white one; take which\nyou choose. But behave like men. Should it be the bloody path, you may\nleave this town in safety to join the English, and we shall then see\nwhich of us can stain our shirts with the most blood. But, should it be\nthe path of peace as brothers of the Big Knives and of their friends the\nFrench, and then you go to your homes and listen to the bad birds,\nyou will then no longer deserve to be called men and warriors,--but\ncreatures of two tongues, which ought to be destroyed. Let us then part\nthis evening in the hope that the Great Spirit will bring us together\nagain with the sun as brothers.”\n\nSo the council broke up. White man and red went trooping into town,\nstaring curiously at the guard which was leading the North Wind and his\nfriends to another night of meditation. What their fate would be no man\nknew. Many thought the tomahawk.\n\nThat night the citizens of the little village of Pain Court, as St.\nLouis was called, might have seen the sky reddened in the eastward. It\nwas the loom of many fires at Cahokia, and around them the chiefs of\nthe forty tribes--all save the three in durance vile--were gathered in\nsolemn talk. Would they take the bloody belt or the white one? No man\ncared so little as the Pale Face Chief. When their eyes were turned from\nthe fitful blaze of the logs, the gala light of many candles greeted\nthem. And above the sound of their own speeches rose the merrier note of\nthe fiddle. The garrison windows shone like lanterns, and behind these\nCreole and backwoodsman swung the village ladies in the gay French\ndances. The man at whose bidding this merrymaking was held stood in a\ncorner watching with folded arms, and none to look at him might know\nthat he was playing for a stake.\n\nThe troubled fires of the Indians had died to embers long before the\ncandles were snuffed in the garrison house and the music ceased.\n\nThe sun himself was pleased to hail that last morning of the great\ncouncil, and beamed with torrid tolerance upon the ceremony of kindling\nthe greatest of the fires. On this morning Colonel Clark did not sit\nalone, but was surrounded by men of weight,--by Monsieur Gratiot and\nother citizens, Captain Bowman and the Spanish officers. And when at\nlength the brush crackled and the flames caught the logs, three of the\nmightiest chiefs arose. The greatest, victor in fifty tribal wars, held\nin his hand the white belt of peace. The second bore a long-stemmed pipe\nwith a huge bowl. And after him, with measured steps, a third came\nwith a smoking censer,--the sacred fire with which to kindle the pipe.\nHalting before Clark, he first swung the censer to the heavens, then to\nthe earth, then to all the spirits of the air,--calling these to witness\nthat peace was come at last,--and finally to the Chief of the Long\nKnives and to the gentlemen of dignity about his person. Next the Indian\nturned, and spoke to his brethren in measured, sonorous tones. He bade\nthem thank that Great Spirit who had cleared the sky and opened their\nears and hearts that they might receive the truth,--who had laid bare to\ntheir understanding the lies of the English. Even as these English\nhad served the Big Knives, so might they one day serve the Indians.\nTherefore he commanded them to cast the tomahawk into the river, and\nwhen they should return to their land to drive the evil birds from it.\nAnd they must send their wise men to Kaskaskia to hear the words of\nwisdom of the Great White Chief, Clark. He thanked the Great Spirit for\nthis council fire which He had kindled at Cahokia.\n\nLifting the bowl of the censer, in the eyes of all the people he drew\nin a long whiff to bear witness of peace. After him the pipe went the\ninterminable rounds of the chiefs. Colonel Clark took it, and puffed;\nCaptain Bowman puffed,--everybody puffed.\n\n“Davy must have a pull,” cried Tom; and even the chiefs smiled as I\ncoughed and sputtered, while my friends roared with laughter. It gave\nme no great notion of the fragrance of tobacco. And then came such a\nhand-shaking and grunting as a man rarely sees in a lifetime.\n\nThere was but one disquieting question left: What was to become of the\nNorth Wind and his friends? None dared mention the matter at such a\ntime. But at length, as the day wore on to afternoon, the Colonel was\nseen to speak quietly to Captain Bowman, and several backwoodsmen went\noff toward the town. And presently a silence fell on the company as they\nbeheld the dejected three crossing the field with a guard. They were led\nbefore Clark, and when he saw them his face hardened to sternness.\n\n“It is only women who watch to catch a bear sleeping,” he said. “The Big\nKnives do not kill women. I shall give you meat for your journey home,\nfor women cannot hunt. If you remain here, you shall be treated as\nsquaws. Set the women free.”\n\nTom McChesney cast off their irons. As for Clark, he began to talk\nimmediately with Monsieur Gratiot, as though he had dismissed them from\nhis mind. And their agitation was a pitiful thing to see. In vain they\npressed about him, in vain they even pulled the fringe of his shirt to\ngain his attention. And then they went about among the other chiefs, but\nthese dared not intercede. Uneasiness was written on every man’s face,\nand the talk went haltingly. But Clark was serenity itself. At length\nwith a supreme effort they plucked up courage to come again to the\ntable, one holding out the belt of peace, and the other the still\nsmouldering pipe.\n\nClark paused in his talk. He took the belt, and flung it away over the\nheads of those around him. He seized the pipe, and taking up his sword\nfrom the table drew it, and with one blow clave the stem in half. There\nwas no anger in either act, but much deliberation.\n\n“The Big Knives,” he said scornfully, “do not treat with women.”\n\nThe pleading began again, the Hungry Wolf interpreting with tremors of\nearnestness. Their lives were spared, but to what purpose, since the\nWhite Chief looked with disfavor upon them? Let him know that bad men\nfrom Michilimackinac put the deed into their hearts.\n\n“When the Big Knives come upon such people in the wilderness,” Clark\nanswered, “they shoot them down that they may not eat the deer. But they\nhave never talked of it.”\n\nHe turned from them once more; they went away in a dejection to wring\nour compassion, and we thought the matter ended at last. The sun\nwas falling low, the people beginning to move away, when, to the\nastonishment of all, the culprits were seen coming back again. With them\nwere two young men of their own nation. The Indians opened up a path for\nthem to pass through, and they came as men go to the grave. So mournful,\nso impressive withal, that the crowd fell into silence again, and the\nColonel turned his eyes. The two young men sank down on the ground\nbefore him and shrouded their heads in their blankets.\n\n“What is this?” Clark demanded.\n\nThe North Wind spoke in a voice of sorrow:--\n\n“An atonement to the Great White Chief for the sins of our nation.\nPerchance the Great Chief will deign to strike a tomahawk into their\nheads, that our nation may be saved in war by the Big Knives.” And the\nNorth Wind held forth the pipe once more.\n\n“I have nothing to say to you,” said Clark.\n\nStill they stood irresolute, their minds now bereft of expedients. And\nthe young men sat motionless on the ground. As Clark talked they peered\nout from under their blankets, once, twice, thrice. He was still talking\nto the wondering Monsieur Gratiot. But no other voice was heard, and the\neyes of all were turned on him in amazement. But at last, when the drama\nhad risen to the pitch of unbearable suspense, he looked down upon\nthe two miserable pyramids at his feet, and touched them. The blankets\nquivered.\n\n“Stand up,” said the Colonel, “and uncover.”\n\nThey rose, cast the blankets from them, and stood with a stoic dignity\nawaiting his pleasure. Wonderful, fine-limbed men they were, and for the\nfirst time Clark’s eyes were seen to kindle.\n\n“I thank the Great Spirit,” said he, in a loud voice, “that I have found\nmen among your nation. That I have at last discovered the real chiefs of\nyour people. Had they sent such as you to treat with me in the beginning\nall might have been well. Go back to your people as their chiefs, and\ntell them that through you the Big Knives have granted peace to your\nnation.”\n\nStepping forward, he grasped them each by the hand, and, despite\ntraining, joy shone in their faces, while a long-drawn murmur arose\nfrom the assemblage. But Clark did not stop there. He presented them to\nCaptain Bowman and to the French and Spanish gentlemen present, and they\nwere hailed by their own kind as chiefs of their nation. To cap it all\nour troops, backwoodsmen and Creole militia, paraded in line on the\ncommon, and fired a salute in their honor.\n\nThus did Clark gain the friendship of the forty tribes in the Northwest\ncountry.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. “AN’ YE HAD BEEN WHERE I HAD BEEN”\n\nWe went back to Kaskaskia, Colonel Clark, Tom, and myself, and a great\nweight was lifted from our hearts.\n\nA peaceful autumn passed, and we were happy save when we thought of\nthose we had left at home. There is no space here to tell of many\nincidents. Great chiefs who had not been to the council came hundreds of\nleagues across wide rivers that they might see with their own eyes this\nman who had made peace without gold, and these had to be amused and\nentertained.\n\nThe apples ripened, and were shaken to the ground by the winds. The good\nFather Gibault, true to his promise, strove to teach me French. Indeed,\nI picked up much of that language in my intercourse with the inhabitants\nof Kaskaskia. How well I recall that simple life,--its dances, its\nsongs, and the games with the laughing boys and girls on the common!\nAnd the good people were very kind to the orphan that dwelt with Colonel\nClark, the drummer boy of his regiment.\n\nBut winter brought forebodings. When the garden patches grew bare and\nbrown, and the bleak winds from across the Mississippi swept over the\ncommon, untoward tidings came like water dripping from a roof, bit by\nbit. And day by day Colonel Clark looked graver. The messengers he had\nsent to Vincennes came not back, and the coureurs and traders from time\nto time brought rumors of a British force gathering like a thundercloud\nin the northeast. Monsieur Vigo himself, who had gone to Vincennes on\nhis own business, did not return. As for the inhabitants, some of them\nwho had once bowed to us with a smile now passed with faces averted.\n\nThe cold set the miry roads like cement, in ruts and ridges. A flurry of\nsnow came and powdered the roofs even as the French loaves are powdered.\n\nIt was January. There was Colonel Clark on a runt of an Indian pony; Tom\nMcChesney on another, riding ahead, several French gentlemen seated on\nstools in a two-wheeled cart, and myself. We were going to Cahokia,\nand it was very cold, and when the tireless wheels bumped from ridge to\ngully, the gentlemen grabbed each other as they slid about, and laughed.\n\nAll at once the merriment ceased, and looking forward we saw that Tom\nhad leaped from his saddle and was bending over something in the snow.\nThese chanced to be the footprints of some twenty men.\n\nThe immediate result of this alarming discovery was that Tom went on\nexpress to warn Captain Bowman, and the rest of us returned to a painful\nscene at Kaskaskia. We reached the village, the French gentlemen leaped\ndown from their stools in the cart, and in ten minutes the streets were\nfilled with frenzied, hooded figures. Hamilton, called the Hair Buyer,\nwas upon them with no less than six hundred, and he would hang them to\ntheir own gateposts for listening to the Long Knives. These were but\na handful after all was said. There was Father Gibault, for example.\nFather Gibault would doubtless be exposed to the crows in the belfry of\nhis own church because he had busied himself at Vincennes and with other\nmatters. Father Gibault was human, and therefore lovable. He bade\nhis parishioners a hasty and tearful farewell, and he made a cold and\npainful journey to the territories of his Spanish Majesty across the\nMississippi.\n\nFather Gibault looked back, and against the gray of the winter’s\ntwilight there were flames like red maple leaves. In the fort the men\nstood to their guns, their faces flushed with staring at the burning\nhouses. Only a few were burned,--enough to give no cover for Hamilton\nand his six hundred if they came.\n\nBut they did not come. The faithful Bowman and his men arrived instead,\nwith the news that there had been only a roving party of forty, and\nthese were now in full retreat.\n\nFather Gibault came back. But where was Hamilton? This was the\ndisquieting thing.\n\nOne bitter day, when the sun smiled mockingly on the powdered common, a\nhorseman was perceived on the Fort Chartres road. It was Monsieur Vigo\nreturning from Vincennes, but he had been first to St. Louis by reason\nof the value he set upon his head. Yes, Monsieur Vigo had been to\nVincennes, remaining a little longer than he expected, the guest of\nGovernor Hamilton. So Governor Hamilton had recaptured that place!\nMonsieur Vigo was no spy, hence he had gone first to St. Louis. Governor\nHamilton was at Vincennes with much of King George’s gold, and many\nsupplies, and certain Indians who had not been at the council. Eight\nhundred in all, said Monsieur Vigo, using his fingers. And it was\nGovernor Hamilton’s design to march upon Kaskaskia and Cahokia and\nsweep over Kentucky; nay, he had already sent certain emissaries to\nMcGillivray and his Creeks and the Southern Indians with presents, and\nthese were to press forward on their side. The Governor could do\nnothing now, but would move as soon as the rigors of winter had somewhat\nrelented. Monsieur Vigo shook his head and shrugged his shoulders. He\nloved les Américains. What would Monsieur le Colonel do now?\n\nMonsieur le Colonel was grave, but this was his usual manner. He did not\ntear his hair, but the ways of the Long Knives were past understanding.\nHe asked many questions. How was it with the garrison at Vincennes?\nMonsieur Vigo was exact, as a business man should be. They were now\nreduced to eighty men, and five hundred savages had gone out to ravage.\nThere was no chance, then, of Hamilton moving at present? Monsieur\nVigo threw up his hands. Never had he made such a trip, and he had been\nforced to come back by a northern route. The Wabash was as the Great\nLakes, and the forests grew out of the water. A fox could not go to\nVincennes in this weather. A fish? Monsieur Vigo laughed heartily. Yes,\na fish might.\n\n“Then,” said Colonel Clark, “we will be fish.”\n\nMonsieur Vigo stared, and passed his hand from his forehead backwards\nover his long hair. I leaned forward in my corner by the hickory fire.\n\n“Then we will be fish,” said Colonel Clark. “Better that than food for\nthe crows. For, if we stay here, we shall be caught like bears in a\ntrap, and Kentucky will be at Hamilton’s mercy.”\n\n“Sacré!” exclaimed Monsieur Vigo, “you are mad, mon ami. I know what\nthis country is, and you cannot get to Vincennes.”\n\n“I will get to Vincennes,” said Colonel Clark, so gently that Monsieur\nVigo knew he meant it. “I will swim to Vincennes.”\n\nMonsieur Vigo raised his hands to heaven. The three of us went out of\nthe door and walked. There was a snowy place in front of the church all\nparty-colored like a clown’s coat,--scarlet capotes, yellow capotes,\nand blue capotes, and bright silk handkerchiefs. They surrounded the\nColonel. Pardieu, what was he to do now? For the British governor\nand his savages were coming to take revenge on them because, in their\nnecessity, they had declared for Congress. Colonel Clark went silently\non his way to the gate; but Monsieur Vigo stopped, and Kaskaskia heard,\nwith a shock, that this man of iron was to march against Vincennes.\n\nThe gates of the fort were shut, and the captains summoned. Undaunted\nwoodsmen as they were, they were lukewarm, at first, at the idea of\nthis march through the floods. Who can blame them? They had, indeed,\nsacrificed much. But in ten minutes they had caught his enthusiasm\n(which is one of the mysteries of genius). And the men paraded in the\nsnow likewise caught it, and swung their hats at the notion of taking\nthe Hair Buyer.\n\n“‘Tis no news to me,” said Terence, stamping his feet on the flinty\nground; “wasn’t it Davy that pointed him out to us and the hair liftin’\nfrom his head six months since?”\n\n“Und you like schwimmin’, yes?” said Swein Poulsson, his face like the\nrising sun with the cold.\n\n“Swimmin’, is it?” said Terence; “sure, the divil made worse things than\nwather. And Hamilton’s beyant.”\n\n“I reckon that’ll fetch us through,” Bill Cowan put in grimly.\n\nIt was a blessed thing that none of us had a bird’s-eye view of that\nsame water. No man of force will listen when his mind is made up, and\nperhaps it is just as well. For in that way things are accomplished.\nClark would not listen to Monsieur Vigo, and hence the financier had,\nperforce, to listen to Clark. There were several miracles before we\nleft. Monsieur Vigo, for instance, agreed to pay the expenses of the\nexpedition, though in his heart he thought we should never get to\nVincennes. Incidentally, he was never repaid. Then there were the\nFrench--yesterday, running hither and thither in paroxysms of fear;\nto-day, enlisting in whole companies, though it were easier to get to\nthe wild geese of the swamps than to Hamilton. Their ladies stitched\ncolors day and night, and presented them with simple confidence to the\nColonel in the church. Twenty stands of colors for 170 men, counting\nthose who had come from Cahokia. Think of the industry of it, of the\nenthusiasm behind it! Twenty stands of colors! Clark took them all,\nand in due time it will be told how the colors took Vincennes. This was\nbecause Colonel Clark was a man of destiny.\n\nFurthermore, Colonel Clark was off the next morning at dawn to buy a\nMississippi keel-boat. He had her rigged up with two four-pounders and\nfour swivels, filled her with provisions, and called her the Willing.\nShe was the first gunboat on the Western waters. A great fear came into\nmy heart, and at dusk I stole back to the Colonel’s house alone. The\nsnow had turned to rain, and Terence stood guard within the doorway.\n\n“Arrah,” he said, “what ails ye, darlin’?”\n\nI gulped and the tears sprang into my eyes; whereupon Terence, in\ndefiance of all military laws, laid his gun against the doorpost and\nput his arms around me, and I confided my fears. It was at this critical\njuncture that the door opened and Colonel Clark came out.\n\n“What’s to do here?” he demanded, gazing at us sternly.\n\n“Savin’ your Honor’s prisence,” said Terence, “he’s afeard your Honor\nwill be sending him on the boat. Sure, he wants to go swimmin’ with the\nrest of us.”\n\nColonel Clark frowned, bit his lip, and Terence seized his gun and stood\nto attention.\n\n“It were right to leave you in Kaskaskia,” said the Colonel; “the water\nwill be over your head.”\n\n“The King’s drum would be floatin’ the likes of him,” said the\nirrepressible Terence, “and the b’ys would be that lonesome.”\n\nThe Colonel walked away without a word. In an hour’s time he came back\nto find me cleaning his accoutrements by the fire. For a while he did\nnot speak, but busied himself with his papers, I having lighted the\ncandles for him. Presently he spoke my name, and I stood before him.\n\n“I will give you a piece of advice, Davy,” said he. “If you want a\nthing, go straight to the man that has it. McChesney has spoken to me\nabout this wild notion of yours of going to Vincennes, and Cowan and\nMcCann and Ray and a dozen others have dogged my footsteps.”\n\n“I only spoke to Terence because he asked me, sir,” I answered. “I said\nnothing to any one else.”\n\nHe laid down his pen and looked at me with an odd expression.\n\n“What a weird little piece you are,” he exclaimed; “you seem to have\nwormed your way into the hearts of these men. Do you know that you will\nprobably never get to Vincennes alive?”\n\n“I don’t care, sir,” I said. A happy thought struck me. “If they see a\nboy going through the water, sir--” I hesitated, abashed.\n\n“What then?” said Clark, shortly.\n\n“It may keep some from going back,” I finished.\n\nAt that he gave a sort of gasp, and stared at me the more.\n\n“Egad,” he said, “I believe the good Lord launched you wrong end to.\nPerchance you will be a child when you are fifty.”\n\nHe was silent a long time, and fell to musing. And I thought he had\nforgotten.\n\n“May I go, sir?” I asked at length.\n\nHe started.\n\n“Come here,” said he. But when I was close to him he merely laid his\nhand on my shoulder. “Yes, you may go, Davy.”\n\nHe sighed, and presently turned to his writing again, and I went back\njoyfully to my cleaning.\n\nOn a certain dark 4th of February, picture the village of Kaskaskia\nassembled on the river-bank in capote and hood. Ropes are cast off, the\nkeel-boat pushes her blunt nose through the cold, muddy water, the oars\nchurn up dirty, yellow foam, and cheers shake the sodden air. So the\nWilling left on her long journey: down the Kaskaskia, into the flood of\nthe Mississippi, against many weary leagues of the Ohio’s current, and\nup the swollen Wabash until they were to come to the mouth of the White\nRiver near Vincennes. There they were to await us.\n\nShould we ever see them again? I think that this was the unspoken\nquestion in the hearts of the many who were to go by land.\n\nThe 5th was a mild, gray day, with the melting snow lying in patches on\nthe brown bluff, and the sun making shift to pierce here and there. We\nformed the regiment in the fort,--backwoodsman and Creole now to fight\nfor their common country, Jacques and Pierre and Alphonse; and mother\nand father, sweetheart and wife, waiting to wave a last good-by. Bravely\nwe marched out of the gate and into the church for Father Gibault’s\nblessing. And then, forming once more, we filed away on the road leading\nnorthward to the ferry, our colors flying, leaving the weeping, cheering\ncrowd behind. In front of the tall men of the column was a wizened\nfigure, beating madly on a drum, stepping proudly with head thrown back.\nIt was Cowan’s voice that snapped the strain.\n\n“Go it, Davy, my little gamecock!” he cried, and the men laughed and\ncheered. And so we came to the bleak ferry landing where we had crossed\non that hot July night six months before.\n\nWe were soon on the prairies, and in the misty rain that fell and fell\nthey seemed to melt afar into a gray and cheerless ocean. The sodden\ngrass was matted now and unkempt. Lifeless lakes filled the depressions,\nand through them we waded mile after mile ankle-deep. There was a little\ncavalcade mounted on the tiny French ponies, and sometimes I rode with\nthese; but oftenest Cowan or Tom would fling me, drum and all, on his\nshoulder. For we had reached the forest swamps where the water is the\ncolor of the Creole coffee. And day after day as we marched, the soft\nrain came out of the east and wet us to the skin.\n\nIt was a journey of torments, and even that first part of it was enough\nto discourage the most resolute spirit. Men might be led through it, but\nnever driven. It is ever the mind which suffers through the monotonies\nof bodily discomfort, and none knew this better than Clark himself.\nEvery morning as we set out with the wet hide chafing our skin, the\nColonel would run the length of the regiment, crying:--\n\n“Who gives the feast to-night, boys?”\n\nNow it was Bowman’s company, now McCarty’s, now Bayley’s. How the\nhunters vied with each other to supply the best, and spent the days\nstalking the deer cowering in the wet thickets. We crossed the Saline,\nand on the plains beyond was a great black patch, a herd of buffalo.\nA party of chosen men headed by Tom McChesney was sent after them, and\nnever shall I forget the sight of the mad beasts charging through the\nwater.\n\nThat night, when our chilled feet could bear no more, we sought out a\npatch of raised ground a little firmer than a quagmire, and heaped\nup the beginnings of a fire with such brush as could be made to burn,\nrobbing the naked thickets. Saddle and steak sizzled, leather steamed\nand stiffened, hearts and bodies thawed; grievances that men had nursed\nover miles of water melted. Courage sits best on a full stomach, and as\nthey ate they cared not whether the Atlantic had opened between them\nand Vincennes. An hour agone, and there were twenty cursing laggards,\ncounting the leagues back to Kaskaskia. Now:--\n\n “C’était un vieux sauvage\n Tout noir, tour barbouilla,\n Ouich’ ka!\n Avec sa vieill’ couverte\n Et son sac à tabac.\n Ouich’ ka!\n Ah! ah! tenaouich’ tenaga,\n Tenaouich’ tenaga, ouich’ ka!”\n\nSo sang Antoine, dit le Gris, in the pulsing red light. And when,\nbetween the verses, he went through the agonies of a Huron war-dance,\nthe assembled regiment howled with delight. Some men know cities and\nthose who dwell in the quarters of cities. But grizzled Antoine knew\nthe half of a continent, and the manners of trading and killing of the\ntribes thereof.\n\nAnd after Antoine came Gabriel, a marked contrast--Gabriel, five feet\nsix, and the glare showing but a faint dark line on his quivering lip.\nGabriel was a patriot,--a tribute we must pay to all of those brave\nFrenchmen who went with us. Nay, Gabriel had left at home on his little\nfarm near the village a young wife of a fortnight. And so his lip\nquivered as he sang:--\n\n “Petit Rocher de la Haute Montagne,\n Je vien finir ici cette campagne!\n Ah! doux échos, entendez mes soupirs;\n En languissant je vais bientôt mouir!”\n\nWe had need of gayety after that, and so Bill Cowan sang “Billy of the\nWild Wood,” and Terence McCann wailed an Irish jig, stamping the\nwater out of the spongy ground amidst storms of mirth. As he desisted,\nbreathless and panting, he flung me up in the firelight before the eyes\nof them all, crying:--\n\n“It’s Davy can bate me!”\n\n“Ay, Davy, Davy!” they shouted, for they were in the mood for anything.\nThere stood Colonel Clark in the dimmer light of the background. “We\nmust keep ‘em screwed up, Davy,” he had said that very day.\n\nThere came to me on the instant a wild song that my father had taught\nme when the liquor held him in dominance. Exhilarated, I sprang from\nTerence’s arms to the sodden, bared space, and methinks I yet hear my\nshrill, piping note, and see my legs kicking in the fling of it. There\nwas an uproar, a deeper voice chimed in, and here was McAndrew flinging\nhis legs with mine:--\n\n “I’ve faught on land, I’ve faught at sea,\n At hame I faught my aunty, O;\n But I met the deevil and Dundee\n On the braes o’ Killiecrankie, O.\n An’ ye had been where I had been,\n Ye wad na be sae cantie, O;\n An’ ye had seen what I ha’e seen,\n On the braes o’ Killiecrankie, O.”\n\nIn the morning Clark himself would be the first off through the gray\nrain, laughing and shouting and waving his sword in the air, and I after\nhim as hard as I could pelt through the mud, beating the charge on my\ndrum until the war-cries of the regiment drowned the sound of it. For we\nwere upon a pleasure trip--lest any man forget,--a pleasure trip amidst\nstark woods and brown plains flecked with ponds. So we followed him\nuntil we came to a place where, in summer, two quiet rivers flowed\nthrough green forests--the little Wabashes. And now! Now hickory and\nmaple, oak and cottonwood, stood shivering in three feet of water on\nwhat had been a league of dry land. We stood dismayed at the crumbling\nedge of the hill, and one hundred and seventy pairs of eyes were turned\non Clark. With a mere glance at the running stream high on the bank and\nthe drowned forest beyond, he turned and faced them.\n\n“I reckon you’ve earned a rest, boys,” he said. “We’ll have games\nto-day.”\n\nThere were some dozen of the unflinching who needed not to be amused.\nChoosing a great poplar, these he set to hollowing out a pirogue, and\nhimself came among the others and played leap-frog and the Indian game\nof ball until night fell. And these, instead of moping and quarrelling,\nforgot. That night, as I cooked him a buffalo steak, he drew near the\nfire with Bowman.\n\n“For the love of God keep up their spirits, Bowman,” said the Colonel;\n“keep up their spirits until we get them across. Once on the farther\nhills, they cannot go back.”\n\nHere was a different being from the shouting boy who had led the games\nand the war-dance that night in the circle of the blaze. Tired out, we\nwent to sleep with the ring of the axes in our ears, and in the morning\nthere were more games while the squad crossed the river to the drowned\nneck, built a rough scaffold there, and notched a trail across it; to\nthe scaffold the baggage was ferried, and the next morning, bit by bit,\nthe regiment. Even now the pains shoot through my body when I think\nof how man after man plunged waist-deep into the icy water toward the\nfarther branch. The pirogue was filled with the weak, and in the end of\nit I was curled up with my drum.\n\nHeroism is a many-sided thing. It is one matter to fight and finish,\nanother to endure hell’s tortures hour after hour. All day they waded\nwith numbed feet vainly searching for a footing in the slime. Truly, the\nagony of a brave man is among the greatest of the world’s tragedies to\nsee. As they splashed onward through the tree-trunks, many a joke went\nforth, though lips were drawn and teeth pounded together. I have not\nthe heart to recall these jokes,--it would seem a sacrilege. There were\nquarrels, too, the men striving to push one another from the easier\npaths; and deeds sublime when some straggler clutched at the bole of\na tree for support, and was helped onward through excruciating ways.\nA dozen held tremblingly to the pirogue’s gunwale, lest they fall\nand drown. One walked ahead with a smile, or else fell back to lend a\nhelping shoulder to a fainting man.\n\nAnd there was Tom McChesney. All day long I watched him, and thanked God\nthat Polly Ann could not see him thus. And yet, how the pride would have\nleaped within her! Humor came not easily to him, but charity and courage\nand unselfishness he had in abundance. What he suffered none knew; but\nthrough those awful hours he was always among the stragglers, helping\nthe weak and despairing when his strength might have taken him far\nahead toward comfort and safety. “I’m all right, Davy,” he would say, in\nanswer to my look as he passed me. But on his face was written something\nthat I did not understand.\n\nHow the Creole farmers and traders, unused even to the common ways of\nwoodcraft, endured that fearful day and others that followed, I know\nnot. And when a tardy justice shall arise and compel the people of this\nland to raise a shaft in memory of Clark and those who followed him, let\nnot the loyalty of the French be forgotten, though it be not understood.\n\nAt eventide came to lurid and disordered brains the knowledge that the\nother branch was here. And, mercifully, it was shallower than the first.\nHolding his rifle high, with a war-whoop Bill Cowan plunged into the\nstream. Unable to contain myself more, I flung my drum overboard and\nwent after it, and amid shouts and laughter I was towed across by James\nRay.\n\nColonel Clark stood watching from the bank above, and it was he who\npulled me, bedraggled, to dry land. I ran away to help gather brush for\na fire. As I was heaping this in a pile I heard something that I should\nnot have heard. Nor ought I to repeat it now, though I did not need the\nflames to send the blood tingling through my body.\n\n“McChesney,” said the Colonel, “we must thank our stars that we brought\nthe boy along. He has grit, and as good a head as any of us. I reckon if\nit hadn’t been for him some of them would have turned back long ago.”\n\nI saw Tom grinning at the Colonel as gratefully as though he himself had\nbeen praised.\n\nThe blaze started, and soon we had a bonfire. Some had not the strength\nto hold out the buffalo meat to the fire. Even the grumblers and\nmutineers were silent, owing to the ordeal they had gone through. But\npresently, when they began to be warmed and fed, they talked of other\ntrials to be borne. The Embarrass and the big Wabash, for example. These\nmust be like the sea itself.\n\n“Take the back trail, if ye like,” said Bill Cowan, with a loud laugh.\n“I reckon the rest of us kin float to Vincennes on Davy’s drum.”\n\nBut there was no taking the back trail now; and well they knew it. The\ngames began, the unwilling being forced to play, and before they fell\nasleep that night they had taken Vincennes, scalped the Hair Buyer, and\nwere far on the march to Detroit.\n\nMercifully, now that their stomachs were full, they had no worries. Few\nknew the danger we were in of being cut off by Hamilton’s roving bands\nof Indians. There would be no retreat, no escape, but a fight to the\ndeath. And I heard this, and much more that was spoken of in low tones\nat the Colonel’s fire far into the night, of which I never told the rank\nand file,--not even Tom McChesney.\n\nOn and on, through rain and water, we marched until we drew near to the\nriver Embarrass. Drew near, did I say? “Sure, darlin’,” said Terence,\nstaring comically over the gray waste, “we’ve been in it since\nChoosd’y.” There was small exaggeration in it. In vain did our feet seek\nthe deeper water. It would go no higher than our knees, and the sound\nwhich the regiment made in marching was like that of a great flatboat\ngoing against the current. It had been a sad, lavender-colored day, and\nnow that the gloom of the night was setting in, and not so much as a\nhummock showed itself above the surface, the Creoles began to murmur.\nAnd small wonder! Where was this man leading them, this Clark who had\ncome amongst them from the skies, as it were? Did he know, himself?\nNight fell as though a blanket had been spread over the tree-tops, and\nabove the dreary splashing men could be heard calling to one another in\nthe darkness. Nor was there any supper ahead. For our food was gone,\nand no game was to be shot over this watery waste. A cold like that of\neternal space settled in our bones. Even Terence McCann grumbled.\n\n“Begob,” said he, “‘tis fine weather for fishes, and the birrds are that\ncomfortable in the threes. ‘Tis no place for a baste at all, at all.”\n\nSometime in the night there was a cry. Ray had found the water falling\nfrom an oozy bank, and there we dozed fitfully until we were startled by\na distant boom.\n\nIt was Governor Hamilton’s morning gun at Fort Sackville, Vincennes.\n\nThere was no breakfast. How we made our way, benumbed with hunger and\ncold, to the banks of the Wabash, I know not. Captain McCarty’s company\nwas set to making canoes, and the rest of us looked on apathetically\nas the huge trees staggered and fell amidst a fountain of spray in the\nshallow water. We were but three leagues from Vincennes. A raft was\nbound together, and Tom McChesney and three other scouts sent on a\ndesperate journey across the river in search of boats and provisions,\nlest we starve and fall and die on the wet flats. Before he left Tom\ncame to me, and the remembrance of his gaunt face haunted me for many\nyears after. He drew something from his bosom and held it out to me, and\nI saw that it was a bit of buffalo steak which he had saved. I shook my\nhead, and the tears came into my eyes.\n\n“Come, Davy,” he said, “ye’re so little, and I beant hungry.”\n\nAgain I shook my head, and for the life of me I could say nothing.\n\n“I reckon Polly Ann’d never forgive me if anything was to happen to\nyou,” said he.\n\nAt that I grew strangely angry.\n\n“It’s you who need it,” I cried, “it’s you that has to do the work. And\nshe told me to take care of you.”\n\nThe big fellow grinned sheepishly, as was his wont.\n\n“‘Tis only a bite,” he pleaded, “‘twouldn’t only make me hungry,\nand”--he looked hard at me--“and it might be the savin’ of you. Ye’ll\nnot eat it for Polly Ann’s sake?” he asked coaxingly.\n\n“‘Twould not be serving her,” I answered indignantly.\n\n“Ye’re an obstinate little deevil!” he cried, and, dropping the morsel\non the freshly cut stump, he stalked away. I ran after him, crying out,\nbut he leaped on the raft that was already in the stream and began to\npole across. I slipped the piece into my own hunting shirt.\n\nAll day the men who were too weak to swing axes sat listless on the\nbank, watching in vain for some sight of the Willing. They saw a canoe\nrounding the bend instead, with a single occupant paddling madly. And\nwho should this be but Captain Willing’s own brother, escaped from\nthe fort, where he had been a prisoner. He told us that a man named\nMaisonville, with a party of Indians, was in pursuit of him, and the\nnext piece of news he had was in the way of raising our despair a\nlittle. Governor Hamilton’s astonishment at seeing this force here and\nnow would be as great as his own. Governor Hamilton had said, indeed,\nthat only a navy could take Vincennes this year. Unfortunately, Mr.\nWilling brought no food. Next in order came five Frenchmen, trapped by\nour scouts, nor had they any provisions. But as long as I live I shall\nnever forget how Tom McChesney returned at nightfall, the hero of the\nhour. He had shot a deer; and never did wolves pick an animal cleaner.\nThey pressed on me a choice piece of it, these great-hearted men who\nwere willing to go hungry for the sake of a child, and when I refused it\nthey would have forced it down my throat. Swein Poulsson, he that once\nhid under the bed, deserves a special tablet to his memory. He was for\ngiving me all he had, though his little eyes were unnaturally bright and\nthe red had left his cheeks now.\n\n“He haf no belly, only a leedle on his backbone!” he cried.\n\n“Begob, thin, he has the backbone,” said Terence.\n\n“I have a piece,” said I, and drew forth that which Tom had given me.\n\nThey brought a quarter of a saddle to Colonel Clark, but he smiled at\nthem kindly and told them to divide it amongst the weak. He looked at me\nas I sat with my feet crossed on the stump.\n\n“I will follow Davy’s example,” said he.\n\nAt length the canoes were finished and we crossed the river, swimming\nover the few miserable skeletons of the French ponies we had brought\nalong. We came to a sugar camp, and beyond it, stretching between us and\nVincennes, was a sea of water. Here we made our camp, if camp it could\nbe called. There was no fire, no food, and the water seeped out of the\nground on which we lay. Some of those even who had not yet spoken now\nopenly said that we could go no farther. For the wind had shifted into\nthe northwest, and, for the first time since we had left Kaskaskia we\nsaw the stars gleaming like scattered diamonds in the sky. Bit by bit\nthe ground hardened, and if by chance we dozed we stuck to it. Morning\nfound the men huddled like sheep, their hunting shirts hard as boards,\nand long before Hamilton’s gun we were up and stamping. Antoine poked\nthe butt of his rifle through the ice of the lake in front of us.\n\n“I think we not get to Vincennes this day,” he said.\n\nColonel Clark, who heard him, turned to me.\n\n“Fetch McChesney here, Davy,” he said. Tom came.\n\n“McChesney,” said he, “when I give the word, take Davy and his drum on\nyour shoulders and follow me. And Davy, do you think you can sing that\nsong you gave us the other night?”\n\n“Oh, yes, sir,” I answered.\n\nWithout more ado the Colonel broke the skim of ice, and, taking some of\nthe water in his hand, poured powder from his flask into it and rubbed\nit on his face until he was the color of an Indian. Stepping back, he\nraised his sword high in the air, and, shouting the Shawanee war-whoop,\ntook a flying leap up to his thighs in the water. Tom swung me instantly\nto his shoulder and followed, I beating the charge with all my might,\nthough my hands were so numb that I could scarce hold the sticks.\nStrangest of all, to a man they came shouting after us.\n\n“Now, Davy!” said the Colonel.\n\n “I’ve faught on land, I’ve faught at sea,\n At hame I faught my aunty, O;\n But I met the deevil and Dundee\n On the braes o’ Killiecrankie, O.”\n\nI piped it at the top of my voice, and sure enough the regiment took up\nthe chorus, for it had a famous swing.\n\n “An’ ye had been where I had been,\n Ye wad na be sae cantie, O;\n An’ ye had seen what I ha’e seen’\n On the braes o’ Killiecrankie, O.”\n\nWhen their breath was gone we heard Cowan shout that he had found a\npath under his feet,--a path that was on dry land in the summer-time. We\nfollowed it, feeling carefully, and at length, when we had suffered all\nthat we could bear, we stumbled on to a dry ridge. Here we spent another\nnight of torture, with a second backwater facing us coated with a full\ninch of ice.\n\nAnd still there was nothing to eat.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. THE HAIR BUYER TRAPPED\n\nTo lie the night on adamant, pierced by the needles of the frost; to\nawake shivering and famished, until the meaning of an inch of ice on\nthe backwater comes to your mind,--these are not calculated to put a man\ninto an equable mood to listen to oratory. Nevertheless there was a\nkind of oratory to fit the case. To picture the misery of these men\nis well-nigh impossible. They stood sluggishly in groups, dazed by\nsuffering, and their faces were drawn and their eyes ringed, their\nbeards and hair matted. And many found it in their hearts to curse Clark\nand that government for which he fought.\n\nWhen the red fire of the sun glowed through the bare branches that\nmorning, it seemed as if the campaign had spent itself like an arrow\nwhich drops at the foot of the mark. Could life and interest and\nenthusiasm be infused again in such as these? I have ceased to marvel\nhow it was done. A man no less haggard than the rest, but with a\ncompelling force in his eyes, pointed with a blade to the hills across\nthe river. They must get to them, he said, and their troubles would be\nended. He said more, and they cheered him. These are the bare facts. He\npicked a man here, and another there, and these went silently to a grim\nduty behind the regiment.\n\n“If any try to go back, shoot them down!” he cried.\n\nThen with a gun-butt he shattered the ice and was the first to leap\ninto the water under it. They followed, some with a cheer that was most\npitiful of all. They followed him blindly, as men go to torture, but\nthey followed him, and the splashing and crushing of the ice were sounds\nto freeze my body. I was put in a canoe. In my day I have beheld great\nsuffering and hardship, and none of it compared to this. Torn with pity,\nI saw them reeling through the water, now grasping trees and bushes\nto try to keep their feet, the strongest breaking the way ahead and\nsupporting the weak between them. More than once Clark himself tottered\nwhere he beat the ice at the apex of the line. Some swooned and would\nhave drowned had they not been dragged across the canoe and chafed back\nto consciousness. By inches the water shallowed. Clark reached the high\nground, and then Bill Cowan, with a man on each shoulder. Then others\nendured to the shallows to fall heavily in the crumbled ice and be\ndragged out before they died. But at length, by God’s grace, the whole\nregiment was on the land. Fires would not revive some, but Clark himself\nseized a fainting man by the arms and walked him up and down in the\nsunlight until his blood ran again.\n\nIt was a glorious day, a day when the sap ran in the maples, and the sun\nsoared upwards in a sky of the palest blue. All this we saw through the\ntracery of the leafless branches,--a mirthless, shivering crowd, crept\nthrough a hell of weather into the Hair Buyer’s very lair. Had he\nneither heard nor seen?\n\nDown the steel-blue lane of water between the ice came a canoe. Our\nstunted senses perceived it, unresponsive. A man cried out (it was Tom\nMcChesney); now some of them had leaped into the pirogue, now they were\nreturning. In the towed canoe two fat and stolid squaws and a pappoose\nwere huddled, and beside them--God be praised!--food. A piece of buffalo\non its way to town, and in the end compartment of the boat tallow\nand bear’s grease lay revealed by two blows of the tomahawk. The\nkettles--long disused--were fetched, and broth made and fed in sips to\nthe weakest, while the strongest looked on and smiled in an agony of\nself-restraint. It was a fearful thing to see men whose legs had refused\nservice struggle to their feet when they had drunk the steaming, greasy\nmixture. And the Colonel, standing by the river’s edge, turned his face\naway--down-stream. And then, as often, I saw the other side of the man.\nSuddenly he looked at me, standing wistful at his side.\n\n“They have cursed me,” said he, by way of a question, “they have cursed\nme every day.” And seeing me silent, he insisted, “Tell me, is it not\nso, Davy?”\n\n“It is so,” I said, wondering that he should pry, “but it was while they\nsuffered. And--and some refrained.”\n\n“And you?” he asked queerly.\n\n“I--I could not, sir. For I asked leave to come.”\n\n“If they have condemned me to a thousand hells,” said he,\ndispassionately, “I should not blame them.” Again he looked at me. “Do\nyou understand what you have done?” he asked.\n\n“No, sir,” I said uneasily.\n\n“And yet there are some human qualities in you, Davy. You have been\nworth more to me than another regiment.”\n\nI stared.\n\n“When you grow older, if you ever do, tell your children that once upon\na time you put a hundred men to shame. It is no small thing.”\n\nSeeing him relapse into silence, I did not speak. For the space of half\nan hour he stared down the river, and I knew that he was looking vainly\nfor the Willing.\n\nAt noon we crossed, piecemeal, a deep lake in the canoes, and marching\nawhile came to a timber-covered rise which our French prisoners named\nas the Warriors’ Island. And from the shelter of its trees we saw the\nsteely lines of a score of low ponds, and over the tops of as many\nridges a huddle of brown houses on the higher ground.\n\nAnd this was the place we had all but sold our lives to behold! This was\nVincennes at last! We were on the heights behind the town,--we were at\nthe back door, as it were. At the far side, on the Wabash River, was the\nfront door, or Fort Sackville, where the banner of England snapped in\nthe February breeze.\n\nWe stood there, looking, as the afternoon light flooded the plain.\nSuddenly the silence was broken.\n\n“Hooray for Clark!” cried a man at the edge of the copse.\n\n“Hooray for Clark!”--it was the whole regiment this time. From\nexecration to exaltation was but a step, after all. And the Creoles fell\nto scoffing at their sufferings and even forgot their hunger in staring\nat the goal. The backwoodsmen took matters more stolidly, having\nacquired long since the art of waiting. They lounged about, cleaning\ntheir guns, watching the myriad flocks of wild ducks and geese casting\nblue-black shadows on the ponds.\n\n“Arrah, McChesney,” said Terence, as he watched the circling birds,\n“Clark’s a great man, but ‘tis more riverince I’d have for him if wan av\nthim was sizzling on the end of me ramrod.”\n\n“I’d sooner hev the Ha’r Buyer’s sculp,” said Tom.\n\nPresently there was a drama performed for our delectation. A shot came\ndown the wind, and we perceived that several innocent Creole gentlemen,\nunconscious of what the timber held, were shooting the ducks and geese.\nWhereupon Clark chose Antoine and three of our own Creoles to sally out\nand shoot likewise--as decoys. We watched them working their way over\nthe ridges, and finally saw them coming back with one of the Vincennes\nsportsmen. I cannot begin to depict the astonishment of this man when\nhe reached the copse, and was led before our lean, square-shouldered\ncommander. Yes, monsieur, he was a friend of les Américains. Did\nGovernor Hamilton know that a visit was imminent? Pardieu (with many\nshrugs and outward gestures of the palms), Governor Hamilton had said if\nthe Long Knives had wings or fins they might reach him now--he was all\nunprepared.\n\n“Gentlemen,” said Colonel Clark to Captains Bowman and McCarty and\nWilliams, “we have come so far by audacity, and we must continue by\naudacity. It is of no use to wait for the gunboat, and every moment\nwe run the risk of discovery. I shall write an open letter to the\ninhabitants of Vincennes, which the prisoner shall take into town. I\nshall tell them that those who are true to the oath they swore to Father\nGibault shall not be molested if they remain quietly in their houses.\nLet those who are on the side of the Hair Buyer General and his King go\nto the fort and fight there.”\n\nHe bade me fetch the portfolio he carried, and with numbed fingers wrote\nthe letter while his captains stared in admiration and amazement. What\na stroke was this! There were six hundred men in the town and\nfort,--soldiers, inhabitants, and Indians,--while we had but 170,\nstarved and weakened by their incredible march. But Clark was not to\nbe daunted. Whipping out his field-glasses, he took a stand on a little\nmound under the trees and followed the fast-galloping messenger across\nthe plain; saw him enter the town; saw the stir in the streets, knots of\nmen riding out and gazing, hands on foreheads, towards the place where\nwe were. But, as the minutes rolled into hours, there was no further\nalarm. No gun, no beat to quarters or bugle-call from Fort Sackville.\nWhat could it mean?\n\nClark’s next move was an enigma, for he set the men to cutting and\ntrimming tall sapling poles. To these were tied (how reverently!) the\ntwenty stands of colors which loving Creole hands had stitched. The\nboisterous day was reddening to its close as the Colonel lined his\nlittle army in front of the wood, and we covered the space of four\nthousand. For the men were twenty feet apart and every tenth carried a\nstandard. Suddenly we were aghast as the full meaning of the inspiration\ndawned upon us. The command was given, and we started on our march\ntoward Vincennes. But not straight,--zigzagging, always keeping the\nridges between us and the town, and to the watching inhabitants it\nseemed as if thousands were coming to crush them. Night fell, the colors\nwere furled and the saplings dropped, and we pressed into serried\nranks and marched straight over hill and dale for the lights that were\nbeginning to twinkle ahead of us.\n\nWe halted once more, a quarter of a mile away. Clark himself had picked\nfourteen men to go under Lieutenant Bayley through the town and take the\nfort from the other side. Here was audacity with a vengeance. You may\nbe sure that Tom and Cowan and Ray were among these, and I trotted after\nthem with the drum banging against my thighs.\n\nWas ever stronghold taken thus?\n\nThey went right into the town, the fourteen of them, into the main\nstreet that led directly to the fort. The simple citizens gave back,\nstupefied, at sight of the tall, striding forms. Muffled Indians stood\nlike statues as we passed, but these raised not a hand against us. Where\nwere Hamilton, Hamilton’s soldiers and savages? It was as if we had come\na-trading.\n\nThe street rose and fell in waves, like the prairie over which it ran.\nAs we climbed a ridge, here was a little log church, the rude cross\non the belfry showing dark against the sky. And there, in front of us,\nflanked by blockhouses with conical caps, was the frowning mass of Fort\nSackville.\n\n“Take cover,” said Williams, hoarsely. It seemed incredible.\n\nThe men spread hither and thither, some at the corners of the church,\nsome behind the fences of the little gardens. Tom chose a great forest\ntree that had been left standing, and I went with him. He powdered his\npan, and I laid down my drum beside the tree, and then, with an impulse\nthat was rare, Tom seized me by the collar and drew me to him.\n\n“Davy,” he whispered, and I pinched him. “Davy, I reckon Polly Ann’d be\nkinder surprised if she knew where we was. Eh?”\n\nI nodded. It seemed strange, indeed, to be talking thus at such a place.\nLife has taught me since that it was not so strange, for however a\nman may strive and suffer for an object, he usually sits quiet at the\nconsummation. Here we were in the door-yard of a peaceful cabin, the\nground frozen in lumps under our feet, and it seemed to me that the wind\nhad something to do with the lightness of the night.\n\n“Davy,” whispered Tom again, “how’d ye like to see the little feller to\nhome?”\n\nI pinched him again, and harder this time, for I was at a loss for\nadequate words. The muscles of his legs were as hard as the strands of\na rope, and his buckskin breeches frozen so that they cracked under my\nfingers.\n\nSuddenly a flickering light arose ahead of us, and another, and we saw\nthat they were candles beginning to twinkle through the palings of the\nfort. These were badly set, the width of a man’s hand apart. Presently\nhere comes a soldier with a torch, and as he walked we could see from\ncrack to crack his bluff face all reddened by the light, and so near\nwere we that we heard the words of his song:--\n\n “O, there came a lass to Sudbury Fair,\n With a hey, and a ho, nonny-nonny!\n And she had a rose in her raven hair,\n With a hey, and a ho, nonny-nonny!”\n\n“By the etarnal!” said Tom, following the man along the palings with the\nmuzzle of his Deckard, “by the etarnal! ‘tis like shootin’ beef.”\n\nA gust of laughter came from somewhere beyond. The burly soldier paused\nat the foot of the blockhouse.\n\n“Hi, Jem, have ye seen the General’s man? His Honor’s in a ‘igh temper,\nI warrant ye.”\n\nIt was fortunate for Jem that he put his foot inside the blockhouse\ndoor.\n\n“Now, boys!”\n\nIt was Williams’s voice, and fourteen rifles sputtered out a ragged\nvolley.\n\nThere was an instant’s silence, and then a score of voices raised in\nconsternation,--shouting, cursing, commanding. Heavy feet pounded on the\nplatform of the blockhouse. While Tom was savagely jamming in powder and\nball, the wicket gate of the fort opened, a man came out and ran to a\nhouse a biscuit’s throw away, and ran back again before he was shot at,\nslamming the gate after him. Tom swore.\n\n“We’ve got but the ten rounds,” he said, dropping his rifle to his knee.\n“I reckon ‘tis no use to waste it.”\n\n“The Willing may come to-night,” I answered.\n\nThere was a bugle winding a strange call, and the roll of a drum, and\nthe running continued.\n\n“Don’t fire till you’re sure, boys,” said Captain Williams.\n\nOur eyes caught sight of a form in the blockhouse port, there was an\ninstant when a candle flung its rays upon a cannon’s flank, and Tom’s\nrifle spat a rod of flame. A red blot hid the cannon’s mouth, and behind\nit a man staggered and fell on the candle, while the shot crunched its\nway through the logs of the cottage in the yard where we stood. And now\nthe battle was on in earnest, fire darting here and there from the\nblack wall, bullets whistling and flying wide, and at intervals cannon\nbelching, their shot grinding through trees and houses. But our men\nwaited until the gunners lit their matches in the cannon-ports,--it was\nno trick for a backwoodsman.\n\nAt length there came a popping right and left, and we knew that Bowman\nand McCarty’s men had swung into position there.\n\nAn hour passed, and a shadow came along our line, darting from cover to\ncover. It was Lieutenant Bayley, and he sent me back to find the Colonel\nand to tell him that the men had but a few rounds left. I sped through\nthe streets on the errand, spied a Creole company waiting in reserve,\nand near them, behind a warehouse, a knot of backwoodsmen, French,\nand Indians, lighted up by a smoking torch. And here was Colonel Clark\ntalking to a big, blanketed chief. I was hovering around the skirts of\nthe crowd and seeking for an opening, when a hand pulled me off my feet.\n\n“What ‘ll ye be afther now?” said a voice, which was Terence’s.\n\n“Let me go,” I cried, “I have a message from Lieutenant Bayley.”\n\n“Sure,” said Terence, “a man’d think ye had the Hair Buyer’s sculp\nin yere pocket. The Colonel is treaty-makin’ with Tobaccy’s Son, the\ngrreatest Injun in these parrts.”\n\n“I don’t care.”\n\n“Hist!” said Terence.\n\n“Let me go,” I yelled, so loudly that the Colonel turned, and Terence\ndropped me like a live coal. I wormed my way to where Clark stood.\nTobacco’s Son was at that moment protesting that the Big Knives were\nhis brothers, and declaring that before morning broke he would have one\nhundred warriors for the Great White Chief. Had he not made a treaty\nof peace with Captain Helm, who was even then a prisoner of the British\ngeneral in the fort?\n\nColonel Clark replied that he knew well of the fidelity of Tobacco’s Son\nto the Big Knives, that Tobacco’s Son had remained stanch in the face of\nbribes and presents (this was true). Now all that Colonel Clark desired\nof Tobacco’s Son besides his friendship was that he would keep his\nwarriors from battle. The Big Knives would fight their own fight. To\nthis sentiment Tobacco’s Son grunted extreme approval. Colonel Clark\nturned to me.\n\n“What is it, Davy?” he asked.\n\nI told him.\n\n“Tobacco’s Son has dug up for us King George’s ammunition,” he said. “Go\ntell Lieutenant Bayley that I will send him enough to last him a month.”\n\nI sped away with the message. Presently I came back again, upon another\nmessage, and they were eating,--those reserves,--they were eating as I\nhad never seen men eat but once, at Kaskaskia. The baker stood by with\nlifted palms, imploring the saints that he might have some compensation,\nuntil Clark sent him back to his shop to knead and bake again. The good\nCreoles approached the fires with the contents of their larders in their\nhands. Terence tossed me a loaf the size of a cannon ball, and another.\n\n“Fetch that wan to wan av the b’ys,” said he.\n\nI seized as much as my arms could hold and scurried away to the firing\nline once more, and, heedless of whistling bullets, darted from man to\nman until the bread was exhausted. Not a one but gave me a “God bless\nyou, Davy,” ere he seized it with a great hand and began to eat in\nwolfish bites, his Deckard always on the watch the while.\n\nThere was no sleep in the village. All night long, while the\nrifles sputtered, the villagers in their capotes--men, women, and\nchildren--huddled around the fires. The young men of the militia begged\nClark to allow them to fight, and to keep them well affected he sent\nsome here and there amongst our lines. For our Colonel’s strength\nwas not counted by rifles or men alone: he fought with his brain. As\nHamilton, the Hair Buyer, made his rounds, he believed the town to be in\npossession of a horde of Kentuckians. Shouts, war-whoops, and bursts of\nlaughter went up from behind the town. Surely a great force was there,\na small part of which had been sent to play with him and his men. On the\nfighting line, when there was a lull, our backwoodsmen stood up behind\ntheir trees and cursed the enemy roundly, and often by these taunts\npersuaded the furious gunners to open their ports and fire their cannon.\nWoe be to him that showed an arm or a shoulder! Though a casement be\nlifted ever so warily, a dozen balls would fly into it. And at length,\nwhen some of the besieged had died in their anger, the ports were opened\nno more. It was then our sharpshooters crept up boldly to within thirty\nyards of them--nay, it seemed as if they lay under the very walls of the\nfort. And through the night the figure of the Colonel himself was often\nseen amongst them, praising their markmanship, pleading with every man\nnot to expose himself without cause. He spied me where I had wormed\nmyself behind the foot-board of a picket fence beneath the cannon-port\nof a blockhouse. It was during one of the breathing spaces.\n\n“What’s this?” said he to Cowan, sharply, feeling me with his foot.\n\n“I reckon it’s Davy, sir,” said my friend, somewhat sheepishly. “We\ncan’t do nothin’ with him. He’s been up and down the line twenty times\nthis night.”\n\n“What doing?” says the Colonel.\n\n“Bread and powder and bullets,” answered Bill.\n\n“But that’s all over,” says Clark.\n\n“He’s the very devil to pry,” answered Bill. “The first we know he’ll be\ninto the fort under the logs.”\n\n“Or between them,” says Clark, with a glance at the open palings. “Come\nhere, Davy.”\n\nI followed him, dodging between the houses, and when we had got off the\nline he took me by the two shoulders from behind.\n\n“You little rascal,” said he, shaking me, “how am I to look out for an\narmy and you besides? Have you had anything to eat?”\n\n“Yes, sir,” I answered.\n\nWe came to the fires, and Captain Bowman hurried up to meet him.\n\n“We’re piling up earthworks and barricades,” said the Captain, “for the\nfight to-morrow. My God! if the Willing would only come, we could put\nour cannon into them.”\n\nClark laughed.\n\n“Bowman,” said he, kindly, “has Davy fed you yet?”\n\n“No,” says the Captain, surprised, “I’ve had no time to eat.”\n\n“He seems to have fed the whole army,” said the Colonel. He paused.\n“Have they scented Lamothe or Maisonville?”\n\n“Devil a scent!” cried the Captain, “and we’ve scoured wood and\nquagmire. They tell me that Lamothe has a very pretty force of redskins\nat his heels.”\n\n“Let McChesney go,” said Clark sharply, “McChesney and Ray. I’ll warrant\nthey can find ‘em.”\n\nNow I knew that Maisonville had gone out a-chasing Captain Willing’s\nbrother,--he who had run into our arms. Lamothe was a noted Indian\npartisan and a dangerous man to be dogging our rear that night. Suddenly\nthere came a thought that took my breath and set my heart a-hammering.\nWhen the Colonel’s back was turned I slipped away beyond the range of\nthe firelight, and I was soon on the prairie, stumbling over hummocks\nand floundering into ponds, yet going as quietly as I could, turning now\nand again to look back at the distant glow or to listen to the rifles\npopping around the fort. The night was cloudy and pitchy dark. Twice\nthe whirring of startled waterfowl frightened me out of my senses, but\nambition pricked me on in spite of fear. I may have gone a mile thus,\nperchance two or three, straining every sense, when a sound brought\nme to a stand. At first I could not distinguish it because of my heavy\nbreathing, but presently I made sure that it was the low drone of human\nvoices. Getting down on my hands and knees, I crept forward, and felt\nthe ground rising. The voices had ceased. I gained the crest of a low\nridge, and threw myself flat. A rattle of musketry set me shivering, and\nin an agony of fright I looked behind me to discover that I could not be\nmore than four hundred yards from the fort. I had made a circle. I lay\nvery still, my eyes watered with staring, and then--the droning began\nagain. I went forward an inch, then another and another down the slope,\nand at last I could have sworn that I saw dark blurs against the ground.\nI put out my hand, my weight went after, and I had crashed through a\ncoating of ice up to my elbow in a pool. There came a second of sheer\nterror, a hoarse challenge in French, and then I took to my heels and\nflew towards the fort at the top of my speed.\n\nI heard them coming after me, leap and bound, and crying out to one\nanother. Ahead of me there might have been a floor or a precipice, as\nthe ground looks level at night. I hurt my foot cruelly on a frozen clod\nof earth, slid down the washed bank of a run into the Wabash, picked\nmyself up, scrambled to the top of the far side, and had gotten away\nagain when my pursuer shattered the ice behind me. A hundred yards more,\ntwo figures loomed up in front, and I was pulled up choking.\n\n“Hang to him, Fletcher!” said a voice.\n\n“Great God!” cried Fletcher, “it’s Davy. What are ye up to now?”\n\n“Let me go!” I cried, as soon as I had got my wind. As luck would have\nit, I had run into a pair of daredevil young Kentuckians who had more\nthan once tasted the severity of Clark’s discipline,--Fletcher Blount\nand Jim Willis. They fairly shook out of me what had happened, and then\ndropped me with a war-whoop and started for the prairie, I after them,\ncrying out to them to beware of the run. A man must indeed be fleet\nof foot to have escaped these young ruffians, and so it proved. When I\nreached the hollow there were the two of them fighting with a man in the\nwater, the ice jangling as they shifted their feet.\n\n“What’s yere name?” said Fletcher, cuffing and kicking his prisoner\nuntil he cried out for mercy.\n\n“Maisonville,” said the man, whereupon Fletcher gave a war-whoop and\nkicked him again.\n\n“That’s no way to use a prisoner,” said I, hotly.\n\n“Hold your mouth, Davy,” said Fletcher, “you didn’t ketch him.”\n\n“You wouldn’t have had him but for me,” I retorted.\n\nFletcher’s answer was an oath. They put Maisonville between them, ran\nhim through the town up to the firing line, and there, to my horror,\nthey tied him to a post and used him for a shield, despite his\nheart-rending yells. In mortal fear that the poor man would be shot\ndown, I was running away to find some one who might have influence over\nthem when I met a lieutenant. He came up and ordered them angrily to\nunbind Maisonville and bring him before the Colonel. Fletcher laughed,\nwhipped out his hunting knife, and cut the thongs; but he and Willis\nhad scarce got twenty paces from the officer before they seized poor\nMaisonville by the hair and made shift to scalp him. This was merely\nbackwoods play, had Maisonville but known it. Persuaded, however, that\nhis last hour was come, he made a desperate effort to clear himself,\nwhereupon Fletcher cut off a piece of his skin by mistake. Maisonville,\nmaking sure that he had been scalped, stood groaning and clapping his\nhand to his head, while the two young rascals drew back and stared at\neach other.\n\n“What’s to do now?” said Willis.\n\n“Take our medicine, I reckon,” answered Fletcher, grimly. And they\nseized the tottering man between them, and marched him straightway to\nthe fire where Clark stood.\n\nThey had seen the Colonel angry before, but now they were fairly\nwithered under his wrath. And he could have given them no greater\npunishment, for he took them from the firing line, and sent them back to\nwait among the reserves until the morning.\n\n“Nom de Dieu!” said Maisonville, wrathfully, as he watched them go,\n“they should hang.”\n\n“The stuff that brought them here through ice and flood is apt to boil\nover, Captain,” remarked the Colonel, dryly.\n\n“If you please, sir,” said I, “they did not mean to cut him, but he\nwriggled.”\n\nClark turned sharply.\n\n“Eh?” said he, “did you have a hand in this, too?”\n\n“Peste!” cried the Captain, “the little ferret--you call him--he find\nme on the prairie. I run to catch him with some men and fall into the\ncrick--” he pointed to his soaked leggings, “and your demons, they fall\non top of me.”\n\n“I wish to heaven you had caught Lamothe instead, Davy,” said the\nColonel, and joined despite himself in the laugh that went up. Falling\nsober again, he began to question the prisoner. Where was Lamothe?\nPardieu, Maisonville could not say. How many men did he have, etc.,\netc.? The circle about us deepened with eager listeners, who uttered\nexclamations when Maisonville, between his answers, put up his hand to\nhis bleeding head. Suddenly the circle parted, and Captain Bowman came\nthrough.\n\n“Ray has discovered Lamothe, sir,” said he. “What shall we do?”\n\n“Let him into the fort,” said Clark, instantly.\n\nThere was a murmur of astonished protest.\n\n“Let him into the fort!” exclaimed Bowman.\n\n“Certainly,” said the Colonel; “if he finds he cannot get in, he will be\noff before the dawn to assemble the tribes.”\n\n“But the fort is provisioned for a month,” Bowman expostulated; “and\nthey must find out to-morrow how weak we are.”\n\n“To-morrow will be too late,” said Clark.\n\n“And suppose he shouldn’t go in?”\n\n“He will go in,” said the Colonel, quietly. “Withdraw your men, Captain,\nfrom the north side.”\n\nCaptain Bowman departed. Whatever he may have thought of these orders,\nhe was too faithful a friend of the Colonel’s to delay their execution.\nMurmuring, swearing oaths of astonishment, man after man on the firing\nline dropped his rifle at the word, and sullenly retreated. The crack,\ncrack of the Deckards on the south and east were stilled; not a barrel\nwas thrust by the weary garrison through the logs, and the place became\nsilent as the wilderness. It was the long hour before the dawn. And as\nwe lay waiting on the hard ground, stiff and cold and hungry, talking in\nwhispers, somewhere near six of the clock on that February morning the\ngreat square of Fort Sackville began to take shape. There was the long\nline of the stockade, the projecting blockhouses at each corner with\npeaked caps, and a higher capped square tower from the centre of the\nenclosure, the banner of England drooping there and clinging forlorn to\nits staff, as though with a presentiment. Then, as the light grew, the\nclose-lipped casements were seen, scarred with our bullets. The little\nlog houses of the town came out, the sapling palings and the bare\ntrees,--all grim and gaunt at that cruel season. Cattle lowed here and\nthere, and horses whinnied to be fed.\n\nIt was a dirty, gray dawn, and we waited until it had done its best.\nFrom where we lay hid behind log house and palings we strained our eyes\ntowards the prairie to see if Lamothe would take the bait, until our\nview was ended at the fuzzy top of a hillock. Bill Cowan, doubled up\nbehind a woodpile and breathing heavily, nudged me.\n\n“Davy, Davy, what d’ye see!”.\n\nWas it a head that broke the line of the crest? Even as I stared,\nbreathless, half a score of forms shot up and were running madly for the\nstockade. Twenty more broke after them, Indians and Frenchmen, dodging,\nswaying, crowding, looking fearfully to right and left. And from within\nthe fort came forth a hubbub,--cries and scuffling, orders, oaths, and\nshouts. In plain view of our impatient Deckards soldiers manned the\nplatform, and we saw that they were flinging down ladders. An officer in\na faded scarlet coat stood out among the rest, shouting himself hoarse.\nInvoluntarily Cowan lined his sights across the woodpile on this mark of\ncolor.\n\nLamothe’s men, a seething mass, were fighting like wolves for the\nladders, fearful yet that a volley might kill half of them where they\nstood. And so fast did they scramble upwards that the men before them\nstepped on their fingers. All at once and by acclamation the fierce\nwar-whoops of our men rent the air, and some toppled in sheer terror and\nfell the twelve feet of the stockade at the sound of it. Then every man\nin the regiment, Creole and backwoodsman, lay back to laugh. The answer\nof the garrison was a defiant cheer, and those who had dropped, finding\nthey were not shot at, picked themselves up again and gained the top,\nhelping to pull the ladders after them. Bowman’s men swung back into\nplace, the rattle and drag were heard in the blockhouse as the cannon\nwere run out through the ports, and the battle which had held through\nthe night watches began again with redoubled vigor. But there was more\ncaution on the side of the British, for they had learned dearly how the\nKentuckians could measure crack and crevice.\n\nThere followed two hours and a futile waste of ammunition, the lead from\nthe garrison flying harmless here and there, and not a patch of skin or\ncloth showing.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. THE CAMPAIGN ENDS\n\n “If I am obliged to storm, you may depend upon such treatment as is\njustly due to a murderer. And beware of destroying stores of any kind,\nor any papers or letters that are in your possession; or of hurting one\nhouse in the town. For, by Heaven! if you do, there shall be no mercy\nshown you.\n“To Lieutenant-Governor Hamilton.”\n\nSo read Colonel Clark, as he stood before the log fire in Monsieur\nBouton’s house at the back of the town, the captains grouped in front of\nhim.\n\n“Is that strong enough, gentlemen?” he asked.\n\n“To raise his hair,” said Captain Charleville.\n\nCaptain Bowman laughed loudly.\n\n“I reckon the boys will see to that,” said he.\n\nColonel Clark folded the letter, addressed it, and turned gravely to\nMonsieur Bouton.\n\n“You will oblige me, sir,” said he, “by taking this to Governor\nHamilton. You will be provided with a flag of truce.”\n\nMonsieur Bouton was a round little man, as his name suggested, and the\nmen cheered him as he strode soberly up the street, a piece of sheeting\ntied to a sapling and flung over his shoulder. Through such humble\nagencies are the ends of Providence accomplished. Monsieur Bouton walked\nup to the gate, disappeared sidewise through the postern, and we sat\ndown to breakfast. In a very short time Monsieur Bouton was seen coming\nback, and his face was not so impassive that the governor’s message\ncould not be read thereon.\n\n“‘Tis not a love-letter he has, I’ll warrant,” said Terence, as the\nlittle man disappeared into the house. So accurately had Monsieur\nBouton’s face betrayed the news that the men went back to their posts\nwithout orders, some with half a breakfast in hand. And soon the rank\nand file had the message.\n\n“Lieutenant-Governor Hamilton begs leave to acquaint Colonel Clark that\nhe and his garrison are not disposed to be awed into any action unworthy\nof British subjects.”\n\nOur men had eaten, their enemy was within their grasp and Clark and\nall his officers could scarce keep them from storming. Such was the\ndeadliness of their aim that scarce a shot came back, and time and again\nI saw men fling themselves in front of the breastworks with a war-whoop,\nwave their rifles in the air, and cry out that they would have the Ha’r\nBuyer’s sculp before night should fall. It could not last. Not tuned to\nthe nicer courtesies of warfare, the memory of Hamilton’s war parties,\nof blackened homes, of families dead and missing, raged unappeased.\nThese were not content to leave vengeance in the Lord’s hands, and when\na white flag peeped timorously above the gate a great yell of derision\nwent up from river-bank to river-bank. Out of the postern stepped the\nofficer with the faded scarlet coat, and in due time went back again,\nhaughtily, his head high, casting contempt right and left of him. Again\nthe postern opened, and this time there was a cheer at sight of a man\nin hunting shirt and leggings and coonskin cap. After him came a certain\nMajor Hay, Indian-enticer of detested memory, the lieutenant of him who\nfollowed--the Hair Buyer himself. A murmur of hatred arose from the men\nstationed there, and many would have shot him where he stood but for\nClark.\n\n“The devil has the grit,” said Cowan, though his eyes blazed.\n\nIt was the involuntary tribute. Lieutenant-Governor Hamilton stared\nindifferently at the glowering backwoodsmen as he walked the few steps\nto the church. Not so Major Hay. His eyes fell. There was Colonel Clark\nwaiting at the door through which the good Creoles had been wont to go\nto worship, bowing somewhat ironically to the British General. It was a\nstrange meeting they had in St. Xavier’s, by the light of the candles\non the altar. Hot words passed in that house of peace, the General\ndemanding protection for all his men, and our Colonel replying that he\nwould do with the Indian partisans as he chose.\n\n“And whom mean you by Indian partisans?” the undaunted governor had\ndemanded.\n\n“I take Major Hay to be one of them,” our Colonel had answered.\n\nIt was soon a matter of common report how Clark had gazed fixedly at\nthe Major when he said this, and how the Major turned pale and\ntrembled. With our own eyes we saw them coming out, Major Hay as near\nto staggering as a man could be, the governor blushing red for shame of\nhim. So they went sorrowfully back to the gate.\n\nColonel Clark stood at the steps of the church, looking after them.\n\n“What was that firing?” he demanded sharply. “I gave orders for a\ntruce.”\n\nWe who stood by the church had indeed heard firing in the direction of\nthe hills east of the town, and had wondered thereat. Perceiving a\ncrowd gathered at the far end of the street, we all ran thither save the\nColonel, who directed to have the offenders brought to him at Monsieur\nBouton’s. We met the news halfway. A party of Canadians and Indians had\njust returned from the Falls of the Ohio with scalps they had taken.\nCaptain Williams had gone out with his company to meet them, had lured\nthem on, and finally had killed a number and was returning with the\nprisoners. Yes, here they were! Williams himself walked ahead with two\ndishevelled and frightened coureurs du bois, twoscore at least of\nthe townspeople of Vincennes, friends and relatives of the prisoners,\npressing about and crying out to Williams to have mercy on them. As for\nWilliams, he took them in to the Colonel, the townspeople pressing into\nthe door-yard and banking in front of it on the street. Behind all a\ntragedy impended, nor can I think of it now without sickening.\n\nThe frightened Creoles in the street gave back against the fence, and\nfrom behind them, issuing as a storm-cloud, came the half of Williams’\ncompany, yelling like madmen. Pushed and jostled ahead of them were four\nIndians, decked and feathered, the half-dried scalps dangling from their\nbelts, impassive, true to their creed despite the indignity of jolts and\njars and blows. On and on pressed the mob, gathering recruits at every\ncorner, and when they reached St. Xavier’s before the fort half the\nregiment was there. Others watched, too, from the stockade, and what\nthey saw made their knees smite together with fear. Here were four\nbronzed statues in a row across the street, the space in front of them\nclear that their partisans in the fort might look and consider. What was\npassing in the savage mind no man might know. Not a lip trembled nor\nan eye faltered when a backwoodsman, his memory aflame at sight of the\npitiful white scalps on their belts, thrust through the crowd to curse\nthem. Fletcher Blount, frenzied, snatched his tomahawk from his side.\n\n“Sink, varmint!” he cried with a great oath. “By the etarnal! we’ll pay\nthe H’ar Buyer in his own coin. Sound your drums!” he shouted at the\nfort. “Call the garrison fer the show.”\n\nHe had raised his arm and turned to strike when the savage put up his\nhand, not in entreaty, but as one man demanding a right from another.\nThe cries, the curses, the murmurs even, were hushed. Throwing back\nhis head, arching his chest, the notes of a song rose in the heavy air.\nWild, strange notes they were, that struck vibrant chords in my own\nquivering being, and the song was the death-song. Ay, and the life-song\nof a soul which had come into the world even as mine own. And somewhere\nthere lay in the song, half revealed, the awful mystery of that Creator\nWhom the soul leaped forth to meet: the myriad green of the sun playing\nwith the leaves, the fish swimming lazily in the brown pool, the doe\ngrazing in the thicket, and a naked boy as free from care as these; and\nstill the life grows brighter as strength comes, and stature, and power\nover man and beast; and then, God knows what memories of fierce love\nand fiercer wars and triumphs, of desires gained and enemies\nconquered,--God, who has made all lives akin to something which He holds\nin the hollow of His hand; and then--the rain beating on the forest\ncrown, beating, beating, beating.\n\nThe song ceased. The Indian knelt in the black mud, not at the feet of\nFletcher Blount, but on the threshold of the Great Spirit who ruleth\nall things. The axe fell, yet he uttered no cry as he went before his\nMaster.\n\nSo the four sang, each in turn, and died in the sight of some who\npitied, and some who feared, and some who hated, for the sake of land\nand women. So the four went beyond the power of gold and gewgaw, and\nwere dragged in the mire around the walls and flung into the yellow\nwaters of the river.\n\nThrough the dreary afternoon the men lounged about and cursed the\nparley, and hearkened for the tattoo,--the signal agreed upon by the\nleaders to begin the fighting. There had been no command against taunts\nand jeers, and they gathered in groups under the walls to indulge\nthemselves, and even tried to bribe me as I sat braced against a house\nwith my drum between my knees and the sticks clutched tightly in my\nhands.\n\n“Here’s a Spanish dollar for a couple o’ taps, Davy,” shouted Jack\nTerrell.\n\n“Come on, ye pack of Rebel cutthroats!” yelled a man on the wall.\n\nHe was answered by a torrent of imprecations. And so they flung it\nback and forth until nightfall, when out comes the same faded-scarlet\nofficer, holding a letter in his hand, and marches down the street to\nMonsieur Bouton’s. There would be no storming now, nor any man suffered\nto lay fingers on the Hair Buyer.\n\nI remember, in particular, Hamilton the Hair Buyer. Not the fiend my\nimagination had depicted (I have since learned that most villains do not\nlook the part), but a man with a great sorrow stamped upon his face. The\nsun rose on that 25th of February, and the mud melted, and one of our\ncompanies drew up on each side of the gate. Downward slid the lion of\nEngland, the garrison drums beat a dirge, and the Hair Buyer marched out\nat the head of his motley troops.\n\nThen came my own greatest hour. All morning I had been polishing and\ntightening the drum, and my pride was so great as we fell into line that\nso much as a smile could not be got out of me. Picture it all: Vincennes\nin black and white by reason of the bright day; eaves and gables,\nstockade line and capped towers, sharply drawn, and straight above these\na stark flagstaff waiting for our colors; pigs and fowls straying hither\nand thither, unmindful that this day is red on the calendar. Ah! here\nis a bit of color, too,--the villagers on the side streets to see the\nspectacle. Gay wools and gayer handkerchiefs there, amid the joyous,\ncheering crowd of thrice-changed nationality.\n\n“Vive les Bostonnais! Vive les Américains! Vive Monsieur le Colonel\nClark! Vive le petit tambour!”\n\n“Vive le petit tambour!” That was the drummer boy, stepping proudly\nbehind the Colonel himself, with a soul lifted high above mire and\npuddle into the blue above. There was laughter amongst the giants behind\nme, and Cowan saying softly, as when we left Kaskaskia, “Go it, Davy,\nmy little gamecock!” And the whisper of it was repeated among the ranks\ndrawn up by the gate.\n\nYes, here was the gate, and now we were in the fort, and an empire was\ngained, never to be lost again. The Stars and Stripes climbed the staff,\nand the folds were caught by an eager breeze. Thirteen cannon thundered\nfrom the blockhouses--one for each colony that had braved a king.\n\nThere, in the miry square within the Vincennes fort, thin and bronzed\nand travel-stained, were the men who had dared the wilderness in ugliest\nmood. And yet none by himself would have done it--each had come here\ncompelled by a spirit stronger than his own, by a master mind that\nlaughed at the body and its ailments.\n\nColonel George Rogers Clark stood in the centre of the square, under\nthe flag to whose renown he had added three stars. Straight he was, and\nsquare, and self-contained. No weakening tremor of exultation softened\nhis face as he looked upon the men by whose endurance he had been able\nto do this thing. He waited until the white smoke of the last gun had\ndrifted away on the breeze, until the snapping of the flag and the\ndistant village sounds alone broke the stillness.\n\n“We have not suffered all things for a reward,” he said, “but because\na righteous cause may grow. And though our names may be forgotten,\nour deeds will be remembered. We have conquered a vast land that our\nchildren and our children’s children may be freed from tyranny, and we\nhave brought a just vengeance upon our enemies. I thank you, one and\nall, in the name of the Continental Congress and of that Commonwealth\nof Virginia for which you have fought. You are no longer Virginians,\nKentuckians, Kaskaskians, and Cahokians--you are Americans.”\n\nHe paused, and we were silent. Though his words moved us strongly, they\nwere beyond us.\n\n“I mention no deeds of heroism, of unselfishness, of lives saved at the\nperil of others. But I am the debtor of every man here for the years to\ncome to see that he and his family have justice from the Commonwealth\nand the nation.”\n\nAgain he stopped, and it seemed to us watching that he smiled a little.\n\n“I shall name one,” he said, “one who never lagged, who never\ncomplained, who starved that the weak might be fed and walk. David\nRitchie, come here.”\n\nI trembled, my teeth chattered as the water had never made them chatter.\nI believe I should have fallen but for Tom, who reached out from the\nranks. I stumbled forward in a daze to where the Colonel stood, and the\ncheering from the ranks was a thing beyond me. The Colonel’s hand on my\nhead brought me to my senses.\n\n“David Ritchie,” he said, “I give you publicly the thanks of the\nregiment. The parade is dismissed.”\n\nThe next thing I knew I was on Cowan’s shoulders, and he was tearing\nround and round the fort with two companies at his heels.\n\n“The divil,” said Terence McCann, “he dhrummed us over the wather, an’\nthrough the wather; and faix, he would have dhrummed the sculp from\nHamilton’s head and the Colonel had said the worrd.”\n\n“By gar!” cried Antoine le Gris, “now he drum us on to Detroit.”\n\nOut of the gate rushed Cowan, the frightened villagers scattering right\nand left. Antoine had a friend who lived in this street, and in ten\nminutes there was rum in the powder-horns, and the toast was “On to\nDetroit!”\n\nColonel Clark was sitting alone in the commanding officer’s room of\nthe garrison. And the afternoon sun, slanting through the square of the\nwindow, fell upon the maps and papers before him. He had sent for me. I\nhalted in sheer embarrassment on the threshold, looked up at his face,\nand came on, troubled.\n\n“Davy,” he said, “do you want to go back to Kentucky?”\n\n“I should like to stay to the end, Colonel,” I answered.\n\n“The end?” he said. “This is the end.”\n\n“And Detroit, sir?” I returned.\n\n“Detroit!” he cried bitterly, “a man of sense measures his force, and\ndoes not try the impossible. I could as soon march against Philadelphia.\nThis is the end, I say; and the general must give way to the politician.\nAnd may God have mercy on the politician who will try to keep a people’s\naffection without money or help from Congress.”\n\nHe fell back wearily in his chair, while I stood astonished, wondering.\nI had thought to find him elated with victory.\n\n“Congress or Virginia,” said he, “will have to pay Monsieur Vigo, and\nFather Gibault, and Monsieur Gratiot, and the other good people who have\ntrusted me. Do you think they will do so?”\n\n“The Congress are far from here,” I said.\n\n“Ay,” he answered, “too far to care about you and me, and what we have\nsuffered.”\n\nHe ended abruptly, and sat for a while staring out of the window at the\nfigures crossing and recrossing the muddy parade-ground.\n\n“Tom McChesney goes to-night to Kentucky with letters to the county\nlieutenant. You are to go with him, and then I shall have no one\nto remind me when I am hungry, and bring me hominy. I shall have no\nfinancier, no strategist for a tight place.” He smiled a little, sadly,\nat my sorrowful look, and then drew me to him and patted my shoulder.\n“It is no place for a young lad,--an idle garrison. I think,” he\ncontinued presently, “I think you have a future, David, if you do not\nlose your head. Kentucky will grow and conquer, and in twenty years be\na thriving community. And presently you will go to Virginia, and study\nlaw, and come back again. Do you hear?”\n\n“Yes, Colonel.”\n\n“And I would tell you one thing,” said he, with force; “serve the\npeople, as all true men should in a republic. But do not rely upon their\ngratitude. You will remember that?”\n\n“Yes, Colonel.”\n\nA long time he paused, looking on me with a significance I did not\nthen understand. And when he spoke again his voice showed no trace of\nemotion, save in the note of it.\n\n“You have been a faithful friend, Davy, when I needed loyalty. Perhaps\nthe time may come again. Promise me that you will not forget me if I\nam--unfortunate.”\n\n“Unfortunate, sir!” I exclaimed.\n\n“Good-by, Davy,” he said, “and God bless you. I have work to do.”\n\nStill I hesitated. He stared at me, but with kindness.\n\n“What is it, Davy?” he asked.\n\n“Please, sir,” I said, “if I might take my drum?”\n\nAt that he laughed.\n\n“You may,” said he, “you may. Perchance we may need it again.”\n\nI went out from his presence, vaguely troubled, to find Tom. And before\nthe early sun had set we were gliding down the Wabash in a canoe, past\nplaces forever dedicated to our agonies, towards Kentucky and Polly Ann.\n\n“Davy,” said Tom, “I reckon she’ll be standin’ under the ‘simmon tree,\nwaitin’ fer us with the little shaver in her arms.”\n\nAnd so she was.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II. FLOTSAM AND JETSAM\n\n\nCHAPTER I. IN THE CABIN\n\n\nThe Eden of one man may be the Inferno of his neighbor, and now I am to\nthrow to the winds, like leaves of a worthless manuscript, some years of\ntime, and introduce you to a new Kentucky,--a Kentucky that was not for\nthe pioneer. One page of this manuscript might have told of a fearful\nwinter, when the snow lay in great drifts in the bare woods, when Tom\nand I fashioned canoes or noggins out of the great roots, when a new and\nfeminine bit of humanity cried in the bark cradle, and Polly Ann sewed\ndeer leather. Another page--nay, a dozen--could be filled with Indian\nhorrors, ambuscades and massacres. And also I might have told how there\ndrifted into this land, hitherto unsoiled, the refuse cast off by the\nolder colonies. I must add quickly that we got more than our share of\ntheir best stock along with this.\n\nNo sooner had the sun begun to pit the snow hillocks than wild creatures\ncame in from the mountains, haggard with hunger and hardship. They\nhad left their homes in Virginia and the Carolinas in the autumn; an\nunheralded winter of Arctic fierceness had caught them in its grip.\nBitter tales they told of wives and children buried among the rocks.\nFast on the heels of these wretched ones trooped the spring settlers in\ndroves; and I have seen whole churches march singing into the forts,\nthe preacher leading, and thanking God loudly that He had delivered\nthem from the wilderness and the savage. The little forts would not hold\nthem; and they went out to hew clearings from the forest, and to build\ncabins and stockades. And our own people, starved and snowbound, went\nout likewise,--Tom and Polly Ann and their little family and myself\nto the farm at the river-side. And while the water flowed between the\nstumps over the black land, we planted and ploughed and prayed, always\nalert, watching north and south, against the coming of the Indians.\n\nBut Tom was no husbandman. He and his kind were the scouts, the advance\nguard of civilization, not tillers of the soil or lovers of close\ncommunities. Farther and farther they went afield for game, and always\nthey grumbled sorely against this horde which had driven the deer from\nhis cover and the buffalo from his wallow.\n\nLooking back, I can recall one evening when the long summer twilight\nlingered to a close. Tom was lounging lazily against the big persimmon\ntree, smoking his pipe, the two children digging at the roots, and Polly\nAnn, seated on the door-log, sewing. As I drew near, she looked up at\nme from her work. She was a woman upon whose eternal freshness industry\nmade no mar.\n\n“Davy,” she exclaimed, “how ye’ve growed! I thought ye’d be a wizened\nlittle body, but this year ye’ve shot up like a cornstalk.”\n\n“My father was six feet two inches in his moccasins,” I said.\n\n“He’ll be wallopin’ me soon,” said Tom, with a grin. He took a long\nwhiff at his pipe, and added thoughtfully, “I reckon this ain’t no place\nfer me now, with all the settler folks and land-grabbers comin’ through\nthe Gap.”\n\n“Tom,” said I, “there’s a bit of a fall on the river here.”\n\n“Ay,” he said, “and nary a fish left.”\n\n“Something better,” I answered; “we’ll put a dam there and a mill and a\nhominy pounder.”\n\n“And make our fortune grinding corn for the settlers,” cried Polly Ann,\nshowing a line of very white teeth. “I always said ye’d be a rich man,\nDavy.”\n\nTom was mildly interested, and went with us at daylight to measure the\nfall. And he allowed that he would have the more time to hunt if the\nmill were a success. For a month I had had the scheme in my mind, where\nthe dam was to be put, the race, and the wondrous wheel rimmed with cow\nhorns to dip the water. And fixed on the wheel there was to be a crank\nthat worked the pounder in the mortar. So we were to grind until I could\narrange with Mr. Scarlett, the new storekeeper in Harrodstown, to have\ntwo grinding-stones fetched across the mountains.\n\nWhile the corn ripened and the melons swelled and the flax flowered, our\naxes rang by the river’s side; and sometimes, as we worked, Cowan\nand Terrell and McCann and other Long Hunters would come and jeer\ngood-naturedly because we were turning civilized. Often they gave us a\nlift.\n\nIt was September when the millstones arrived, and I spent a joyous\nmorning of final bargaining with Mr. Myron Scarlett. This Mr. Scarlett\nwas from Connecticut, had been a quartermaster in the army, and at\nmuch risk brought ploughs and hardware, and scissors and buttons, and\nbroadcloth and corduroy, across the Alleghanies, and down the Ohio in\nflatboats. These he sold at great profit. We had no money, not even\nthe worthless scrip that Congress issued; but a beaver skin was worth\neighteen shillings, a bearskin ten, and a fox or a deer or a wildcat\nless. Half the village watched the barter. The rest lounged sullenly\nabout the land court.\n\nThe land court--curse of Kentucky! It was just a windowless log house\nbuilt outside the walls, our temple of avarice. The case was this:\nHenderson (for whose company Daniel Boone cut the wilderness road)\nbelieved that he had bought the country, and issued grants therefor. Tom\nheld one of these grants, alas, and many others whom I knew. Virginia\nrepudiated Henderson. Keen-faced speculators bought acre upon acre and\ntract upon tract from the State, and crossed the mountains to extort.\nClaims conflicted, titles lapped. There was the court set in the\nsunlight in the midst of a fair land, held by the shameless, thronged\nday after day by the homeless and the needy, jostling, quarrelling,\nbeseeching. Even as I looked upon this strife a man stood beside me.\n\n“Drat ‘em,” said the stranger, as he watched a hawk-eyed extortioner in\ndrab, for these did not condescend to hunting shirts, “drat ‘em, ef I\nhad my way I’d wring the neck of every mother’s son of ‘em.”\n\nI turned with a start, and there was Mr. Daniel Boone.\n\n“Howdy, Davy,” he said; “ye’ve growed some sence ye’ve ben with Clark.”\n He paused, and then continued in the same strain: “‘Tis the same\nat Boonesboro and up thar at the Falls settlement. The critters\nis everywhar, robbin’ men of their claims. Davy,” said Mr. Boone,\nearnestly, “you know that I come into Kaintuckee when it waren’t nothin’\nbut wilderness, and resked my life time and again. Them varmints is\nwuss’n redskins,--they’ve robbed me already of half my claims.”\n\n“Robbed you!” I exclaimed, indignant that he, of all men, should suffer.\n\n“Ay,” he said, “robbed me. They’ve took one claim after another, tracts\nthat I staked out long afore they heerd of Kaintuckee.” He rubbed his\nrifle barrel with his buckskin sleeve. “I get a little for my skins,\nand a little by surveyin’. But when the game goes I reckon I’ll go after\nit.”\n\n“Where, Mr. Boone?” I asked.\n\n“Whar? whar the varmints cyant foller. Acrost the Mississippi into the\nSpanish wilderness.”\n\n“And leave Kentucky?” I cried.\n\n“Davy,” he answered sadly, “you kin cope with ‘em. They tell me you’re\nbuildin’ a mill up at McChesney’s, and I reckon you’re as cute as any of\n‘em. They beat me. I’m good for nothin’ but shootin’ and explorin’.”\n\nWe stood silent for a while, our attention caught by a quarrel which\nhad suddenly come out of the doorway. One of the men was Jim Willis,--my\nfriend of Clark’s campaign,--who had a Henderson claim near Shawanee\nSprings. The other was the hawk-eyed man of whom Mr. Boone had spoken,\nand fragments of their curses reached us where we stood. The hunting\nshirts surged around them, alert now at the prospect of a fight; men\ncame running in from all directions, and shouts of “Hang him! Tomahawk\nhim!” were heard on every side. Mr. Boone did not move. It was a common\nenough spectacle for him, and he was not excitable. Moreover, he knew\nthat the death of one extortioner more or less would have no effect on\nthe system. They had become as the fowls of the air.\n\n“I was acrost the mountain last month,” said Mr. Boone, presently,\n“and one of them skunks had stole Campbell’s silver spoons at Abingdon.\nCampbell was out arter him for a week with a coil of rope on his saddle.\nBut the varmint got to cover.”\n\nMr. Boone wished me luck in my new enterprise, bade me good-by, and set\nout for Redstone, where he was to measure a tract for a Revolutioner.\nThe speculator having been rescued from Jim Willis’s clutches by the\nsheriff, the crowd good-naturedly helped us load our stones between\npack-horses, and some of them followed us all the way home that they\nmight see the grinding. Half of McAfee’s new station had heard the news,\nand came over likewise. And from that day we ground as much corn as\ncould be brought to us from miles around.\n\nPolly Ann and I ran the mill and kept the accounts. Often of a crisp\nautumn morning we heard a gobble-gobble above the tumbling of the water\nand found a wild turkey perched on top of the hopper, eating his fill.\nSome of our meat we got that way. As for Tom, he was off and on. When\nthe roving spirit seized him he made journeys to the westward with Cowan\nand Ray. Generally they returned with packs of skins. But sometimes\nsoberly, thanking Heaven that their hair was left growing on their\nheads. This, and patrolling the Wilderness Road and other militia\nduties, made up Tom’s life. No sooner was the mill fairly started than\noff he went to the Cumberland. I mention this, not alone because I\nremember well the day of his return, but because of a certain happening\nthen that had a heavy influence on my after life.\n\nThe episode deals with an easy-mannered gentleman named Potts, who was\nthe agent for a certain Major Colfax of Virginia. Tom owned under a\nHenderson grant; the Major had been given this and other lands for his\nservices in the war. Mr. Potts arrived one rainy afternoon and found me\nstanding alone under the little lean-to that covered the hopper. How we\nserved him, with the aid of McCann and Cowan and other neighbors, and\nhow we were near getting into trouble because of the prank, will be seen\nlater. The next morning I rode into Harrodstown not wholly easy in my\nmind concerning the wisdom of the thing I had done. There was no one to\nadvise me, for Colonel Clark was far away, building a fort on the banks\nof the Mississippi. Tom had laughed at the consequences; he cared little\nabout his land, and was for moving into the Wilderness again. But\nfor Polly Ann’s sake I wished that we had treated the land agent less\ncavalierly. I was soon distracted from these thoughts by the sight of\nHarrodstown itself.\n\nI had no sooner ridden out of the forest shade when I saw that the place\nwas in an uproar, men and women gathering in groups and running here\nand there between the cabins. Urging on the mare, I cantered across the\nfields, and the first person I met was James Ray.\n\n“What’s the matter?” I asked.\n\n“Matter enough! An army of redskins has crossed the Ohio, and not a\nman to take command. My God,” cried Ray, pointing angrily at the swarms\nabout the land office, “what trash we have got this last year! Kentucky\ncan go to the devil, half the stations be wiped out, and not a thrip do\nthey care.”\n\n“Have you sent word to the Colonel?” I asked.\n\n“If he was here,” said Ray, bitterly, “he’d have half of ‘em swinging\ninside of an hour. I’ll warrant he’d send ‘em to the right-about.”\n\nI rode on into the town, Potts gone out of my mind. Apart from the\nland-office crowds, and looking on in silent rage, stood a group of the\nold settlers,--tall, lean, powerful, yet impotent for lack of a leader.\nA contrast they were, these buckskin-clad pioneers, to the ill-assorted\nhumanity they watched, absorbed in struggles for the very lands they had\nwon.\n\n“By the eternal!” said Jack Terrell, “if the yea’th was ter swaller ‘em\nup, they’d keep on a-dickerin’ in hell.”\n\n“Something’s got to be done,” Captain Harrod put in gloomily; “the red\nvarmints ‘ll be on us in another day. In God’s name, whar is Clark?”\n\n“Hold!” cried Fletcher Blount, “what’s that?”\n\nThe broiling about the land court, too, was suddenly hushed. Men stopped\nin their tracks, staring fixedly at three forms which had come out of\nthe woods into the clearing.\n\n“Redskins, or there’s no devil!” said Terrell.\n\nRedskins they were, but not the blanketed kind that drifted every day\nthrough the station. Their war-paint gleamed in the light, and the white\nedges of the feathered head-dresses caught the sun. One held up in his\nright hand a white belt,--token of peace on the frontier.\n\n“Lord A’mighty!” said Fletcher Blount, “be they Cricks?”\n\n“Chickasaws, by the headgear,” said Terrell. “Davy, you’ve got a hoss.\nRide out and look ‘em over.”\n\nNothing loath, I put the mare into a gallop, and I passed over the very\nplace where Polly Ann had picked me up and saved my life long since. The\nIndians came on at a dog trot, but when they were within fifty paces of\nme they halted abruptly. The chief waved the white belt around his head.\n\n“Davy!” says he, and I trembled from head to foot. How well I knew that\nvoice!\n\n“Colonel Clark!” I cried, and rode up to him. “Thank God you are come,\nsir,” said I, “for the people here are land-mad, and the Northern\nIndians are crossing the Ohio.”\n\nHe took my bridle, and, leading the horse, began to walk rapidly towards\nthe station.\n\n“Ay,” he answered, “I know it. A runner came to me with the tidings,\nwhere I was building a fort on the Mississippi, and I took Willis here\nand Saunders, and came.”\n\nI glanced at my old friends, who grinned at me through the berry-stain\non their faces. We reached a ditch through which the rain of the night\nbefore was draining from the fields Clark dropped the bridle, stooped\ndown, and rubbed his face clean. Up he got again and flung the feathers\nfrom his head, and I thought that his eyes twinkled despite the\nsternness of his look.\n\n“Davy, my lad,” said he, “you and I have seen some strange things\ntogether. Perchance we shall see stranger to-day.”\n\nA shout went up, for he had been recognized. And Captain Harrod and Ray\nand Terrell and Cowan (who had just ridden in) ran up to greet him and\npress his hand. He called them each by name, these men whose loyalty had\nbeen proved, but said no word more nor paused in his stride until he had\nreached the edge of the mob about the land court. There he stood for a\nfull minute, and we who knew him looked on silently and waited.\n\nThe turmoil had begun again, the speculators calling out in strident\ntones, the settlers bargaining and pushing, and all clamoring to be\nheard. While there was money to be made or land to be got they had no\near for the public weal. A man shouldered his way through, roughly, and\nthey gave back, cursing, surprised. He reached the door, and, flinging\nthose who blocked it right and left, entered. There he was recognized,\nand his name flew from mouth to mouth.\n\n“Clark!”\n\nHe walked up to the table, strewn with books and deeds.\n\n“Silence!” he thundered. But there was no need,--they were still for\nonce. “This court is closed,” he cried, “while Kentucky is in danger.\nNot a deed shall be signed nor an acre granted until I come back from\nthe Ohio. Out you go!”\n\nOut they went indeed, judge, brokers, speculators--the evicted and the\ntriumphant together. And when the place was empty Clark turned the key\nand thrust it into his hunting shirt. He stood for a moment on the step,\nand his eyes swept the crowd.\n\n“Now,” he said, “there have been many to claim this land--who will\nfollow me to defend it?”\n\nAs I live, they cheered him. Hands were flung up that were past\ncounting, and men who were barely rested from the hardships of the\nWilderness Trail shouted their readiness to go. But others slunk away,\nand were found that morning grumbling and cursing the chance that had\nbrought them to Kentucky. Within the hour the news had spread to the\nfarms, and men rode in to Harrodstown to tell the Colonel of many who\nwere leaving the plough in the furrow and the axe in the wood, and\nstarting off across the mountains in anger and fear. The Colonel turned\nto me as he sat writing down the names of the volunteers.\n\n“Davy,” said he, “when you are grown you shall not stay at home, I\npromise you. Take your mare and ride as for your life to McChesney, and\ntell him to choose ten men and go to the Crab Orchard on the Wilderness\nRoad. Tell him for me to turn back every man, woman, and child who tries\nto leave Kentucky.”\n\nI met Tom coming in from the field with his rawhide harness over his\nshoulders. Polly Ann stood calling him in the door, and the squirrel\nbroth was steaming on the table. He did not wait for it. Kissing her, he\nflung himself into the saddle I had left, and we watched him mutely as\nhe waved back to us from the edge of the woods.\n\nIn the night I found myself sitting up in bed, listening to a running\nand stamping near the cabin.\n\nPolly Ann was stirring. “Davy,” she whispered, “the stock is oneasy.”\n\nWe peered out of the loophole together and through the little orchard we\nhad planted. The moon flooded the fields, and beyond it the forest was\na dark blur. I can recall the scene now, the rude mill standing by the\nwater-side, the twisted rail fences, and the black silhouettes of the\nhorses and cattle as they stood bunched together. Behind us little Tom\nstirred in his sleep and startled us. That very evening Polly Ann had\nfrightened him into obedience by telling him that the Shawanees would\nget him.\n\nWhat was there to do? McAfee’s Station was four miles away, and Ray’s\nclearing two. Ray was gone with Tom. I could not leave Polly Ann alone.\nThere was nothing for it but to wait.\n\nSilently, that the children might not be waked and lurking savage might\nnot hear, we put the powder and bullets in the middle of the room and\nloaded the guns and pistols. For Polly Ann had learned to shoot. She\ntook the loopholes of two sides of the cabin, I of the other two, and\nthen began the fearful watching and waiting which the frontier knows\nso well. Suddenly the cattle stirred again, and stampeded to the other\ncorner of the field. There came a whisper from Polly Ann.\n\n“What is it?” I answered, running over to her.\n\n“Look out,” she said; “what d’ye see near the mill?”\n\nHer sharp eyes had not deceived her, for mine perceived plainly a dark\nform skulking in the hickory grove. Next, a movement behind the rail\nfence, and darting back to my side of the house I made out a long\nblack body wriggling at the edge of the withered corn-patch. They were\nsurrounding us. How I wished that Tom were home!\n\nA stealthy sound began to intrude itself upon our ears. Listening\nintently, I thought it came from the side of the cabin where the lean-to\nwas, where we stored our wood in winter. The black shadow fell on that\nside, and into a patch of bushes; peering out of the loophole, I could\nperceive nothing there. The noise went on at intervals. All at once\nthere grew on me, with horror, the discovery that there was digging\nunder the cabin.\n\nHow long the sound continued I know not,--it might have been an hour,\nit might have been less. Now I thought I heard it under the wall, now\nbeneath the puncheons of the floor. The pitchy blackness within was such\nthat we could not see the boards moving, and therefore we must needs\nkneel down and feel them from time to time. Yes, this one was lifting\nfrom its bed on the hard earth beneath. I was sure of it. It rose an\ninch--then an inch more. Gripping the handle of my tomahawk, I prayed\nfor guidance in my stroke, for the blade might go wild in the darkness.\nUpward crept the board, and suddenly it was gone from the floor. I swung\na full circle--and to my horror I felt the axe plunging into soft flesh\nand crunching on a bone. I had missed the head! A yell shattered the\nnight as the puncheon fell with a rattle on the boards, and my tomahawk\nwas gone from my hand. Without, the fierce war-cry of the Shawanees that\nI knew so well echoed around the log walls, and the door trembled with a\nblow. The children awoke, crying.\n\nThere was no time to think; my great fear was that the devil in the\ncabin would kill Polly Ann. Just then I heard her calling out to me.\n\n“Hide!” I cried, “hide under the shake-down! Has he got you?”\n\nI heard her answer, and then the sound of a scuffle that maddened me.\nKnife in hand, I crept slowly about, and put my fingers on a man’s neck\nand side. Next Polly Ann careened against me, and I lost him again.\n“Davy, Davy,” I heard her gasp, “look out fer the floor!”\n\nIt was too late. The puncheon rose under me, I stumbled, and it fell\nagain. Once more the awful changing notes of the war-whoop sounded\nwithout. A body bumped on the boards, a white light rose before my eyes,\nand a sharp pain leaped in my side. Then all was black again, but I had\nmy senses still, and my fingers closed around the knotted muscles of an\narm. I thrust the pistol in my hand against flesh, and fired. Two of us\nfell together, but the thought of Polly Ann got me staggering to my feet\nagain, calling her name. By the grace of God I heard her answer.\n\n“Are ye hurt, Davy?”\n\n“No,” said I, “no. And you?”\n\nWe drifted together. ‘Twas she who had the presence of mind.\n\n“The chest--quick, the chest!”\n\nWe stumbled over a body in reaching it. We seized the handles, and with\nall our strength hauled it athwart the loose puncheon that seemed to be\nlifting even then. A mighty splintering shook the door.\n\n“To the ports!” cried Polly Ann, as our heads knocked together.\n\nTo find the rifles and prime them seemed to take an age. Next I was\nstaring through the loophole along a barrel, and beyond it were three\nblack forms in line on a long beam. I think we fired--Polly Ann and\nI--at the same time. One fell. We saw a comedy of the beam dropping\nheavily on the foot of another, and he limping off with a guttural howl\nof rage and pain. I fired a pistol at him, but missed him, and then I\nwas ramming a powder charge down the long barrel of the rifle. Suddenly\nthere was silence,--even the children had ceased crying. Outside, in the\ndooryard, a feathered figure writhed like a snake towards the fence. The\nmoon still etched the picture in black and white.\n\nShots awoke me, I think, distant shots. And they sounded like the\nripping and tearing of cloth for a wound. ‘Twas no new sound to me.\n\n“Davy, dear,” said a voice, tenderly.\n\nOut of the mist the tear-stained face of Polly Ann bent over me. I put\nup my hand, and dropped it again with a cry. Then, my senses coming with\na rush, the familiar objects of the cabin outlined themselves: Tom’s\nwinter hunting shirt, Polly Ann’s woollen shift and sunbonnet on their\npegs; the big stone chimney, the ladder to the loft; the closed door,\nwith a long, jagged line across it where the wood was splintered; and,\ndearest of all, the chubby forms of Peggy and little Tom playing on the\ntrundle-bed. Then my glance wandered to the floor, and on the puncheons\nwere three stains. I closed my eyes.\n\nAgain came a far-off rattle, like stones falling from a great height\ndown a rocky bluff.\n\n“What’s that?” I whispered.\n\n“They’re fighting at McAfee’s Station,” said Polly Ann. She put her cool\nhand on my head, and little Tom climbed up on the bed and looked up into\nmy face, wistfully calling my name.\n\n“Oh, Davy,” said his mother, “I thought ye were never coming back.”\n\n“And the redskins?” I asked.\n\nShe drew the child away, lest he hurt me, and shuddered.\n\n“I reckon ‘twas only a war-party,” she answered. “The rest is at\nMcAfee’s. And if they beat ‘em off--” she stopped abruptly.\n\n“We shall be saved,” I said.\n\nI shall never forget that day. Polly Ann left my side only to feed the\nchildren and to keep watch out of the loopholes, and I lay on my back,\nlistening and listening to the shots. At last these became scattered.\nThen, though we strained our ears, we heard them no more. Was the fort\ntaken? The sun slid across the heavens and shot narrow blades of light,\nnow through one loophole and now through another, until a ray slanted\nfrom the western wall and rested upon the red-and-black paint of two\ndead bodies in the corner. I stared with horror.\n\n“I was afeard to open the door and throw ‘em out,” said Polly Ann,\napologetically.\n\nStill I stared. One of them had a great cleft across his face.\n\n“But I thought I hit him in the shoulder,” I exclaimed.\n\nPolly Ann thrust her hand, gently, across my eyes. “Davy, ye mustn’t\ntalk,” she said; “that’s a dear.”\n\nDrowsiness seized me. But I resisted.\n\n“You killed him, Polly Ann,” I murmured, “you?”\n\n“Hush,” said Polly Ann.\n\nAnd I slept again.\n\n\nCHAPTER II. “THE BEGGARS ARE COME TO TOWN”\n\n\n“They was that destitute,” said Tom, “‘twas a pity to see ‘em.”\n\n“And they be grand folks, ye say?” said Polly Ann.\n\n“Grand folks, I reckon. And helpless as babes on the Wilderness Trail.\nThey had two niggers--his nigger an’ hers--and they was tuckered, too,\nfer a fact.”\n\n“Lawsy!” exclaimed Polly Ann. “Be still, honey!” Taking a piece of\ncorn-pone from the cupboard, she bent over and thrust it between little\nPeggy’s chubby fingers “Be still, honey, and listen to what your Pa\nsays. Whar did ye find ‘em, Tom?”\n\n“‘Twas Jim Ray found ‘em,” said Tom. “We went up to Crab Orchard,\naccordin’ to the Colonel’s orders, and we was thar three days. Ye ought\nto hev seen the trash we turned back, Polly Ann! Most of ‘em was scared\nplum’ crazy, and they was fer gittin ‘out ‘n Kaintuckee at any cost.\nSome was fer fightin’ their way through us.”\n\n“The skulks!” exclaimed Polly Ann. “They tried to kill ye? What did ye\ndo?”\n\nTom grinned, his mouth full of bacon.\n\n“Do?” says he; “we shot a couple of ‘em in the legs and arms, and bound\n‘em up again. They was in a t’arin’ rage. I’m more afeard of a scar’t\nman,--a real scar’t man--nor a rattler. They cussed us till they was\nhoarse. Said they’d hev us hung, an’ Clark, too. Said they hed a right\nto go back to Virginny if they hed a mind.”\n\n“An’ what did ye say?” demanded Polly Ann, pausing in her work, her eyes\nflashing with resentment. “Did ye tell ‘em they was cowards to want to\nsettle lands, and not fight for ‘em? Other folks’ lands, too.”\n\n“We didn’t tell ‘em nothin’,” said Tom; “jest sent ‘em kitin’ back to\nthe stations whar they come from.”\n\n“I reckon they won’t go foolin’ with Clark’s boys again,” said Polly\nAnn, resuming a vigorous rubbing of the skillet. “Ye was tellin’ me\nabout these fine folks ye fetched home.” She tossed her head in the\ndirection of the open door, and I wondered if the fine folks were\noutside.\n\n“Oh, ay,” said Tom; “they was comin’ this way, from the Carolinys. Jim\nRay went out to look for a deer, and found ‘em off ‘n the trail. By the\netarnal, they was tuckered. He was the wust, Jim said, lyin’ down on a\nbed of laurels she and the niggers made. She has sperrit, that woman.\nJim fed him, and he got up. She wouldn’t eat nothin’, and made Jim put\nhim on his hoss. She walked. I can’t mek out why them aristocrats wants\nto come to Kaintuckee. They’re a sight too tender.”\n\n“Pore things!” said Polly Ann, compassionately. “So ye fetched ‘em\nhome.”\n\n“They hadn’t a place ter go,” said he, “and I reckoned ‘twould give ‘em\ntime ter ketch breath, an’ turn around. I told ‘em livin’ in Kaintuck\nwas kinder rough.”\n\n“Mercy!” said Polly Ann, “ter think that they was use’ ter silver\nspoons, and linen, and niggers ter wait on ‘em. Tom, ye must shoot\na turkey, and I’ll do my best to give ‘em a good supper.” Tom rose\nobediently, and seized his coonskin hat. She stopped him with a word.\n“Tom.”\n\n“Ay?”\n\n“Mayhap--mayhap Davy would know ‘em. He’s been to Charlestown with the\ngentry there.”\n\n“Mayhap,” agreed Tom. “Pore little deevil,” said he, “he’s hed a hard\ntime.”\n\n“He’ll be right again soon,” said Polly Ann. “He’s been sleepin’\nthat way, off and on, fer a week.” Her voice faltered into a note of\ntenderness as her eyes rested on me.\n\n“I reckon we owe Davy a heap, Polly Ann,” said he.\n\nI was about to interrupt, but Polly Ann’s next remark arrested me.\n\n“Tom,” said she, “he oughter be eddicated.”\n\n“Eddicated!” exclaimed Tom, with a kind of dismay.\n\n“Yes, eddicated,” she repeated. “He ain’t like you and me. He’s\ndifferent. He oughter be a lawyer, or somethin’.”\n\nTom reflected.\n\n“Ay,” he answered, “the Colonel says that same thing. He oughter be sent\nover the mountain to git l’arnin’.”\n\n“And we’ll be missing him sore,” said Polly Ann, with a sigh.\n\nI wanted to speak then, but the words would not come.\n\n“Whar hev they gone?” said Tom.\n\n“To take a walk,” said Polly Ann, and laughed. “The gentry has sech\nfancies as that. Tom, I reckon I’ll fly over to Mrs. McCann’s an’ beg\nsome of that prime bacon she has.”\n\nTom picked up his rifle, and they went out together. I lay for a long\ntime reflecting. To the strange guests whom Tom in the kindness of his\nheart had brought back and befriended I gave little attention. I was\noverwhelmed by the love which had just been revealed to me. And so I was\nto be educated. It had been in my mind these many years, but I had never\nspoken of it to Polly Ann. Dear Polly Ann! My eyes filled at the thought\nthat she herself had determined upon this sacrifice.\n\nThere were footsteps at the door, and these I heard, and heeded not.\nThen there came a voice,--a woman’s voice, modulated and trained in the\nperfections of speech and in the art of treating things lightly. At the\nsound of that voice I caught my breath.\n\n“What a pastoral! Harry, if we have sought for virtue in the wilderness,\nwe have found it.”\n\n“When have we ever sought for virtue, Sarah?”\n\nIt was the man who answered and stirred another chord of my memory.\n\n“When, indeed!” said the woman; “‘tis a luxury that is denied us, I fear\nme.”\n\n“Egad, we have run the gamut, all but that.”\n\nI thought the woman sighed.\n\n“Our hosts are gone out,” she said, “bless their simple souls! ‘Tis\nArcady, Harry, ‘where thieves do not break in and steal.’ That’s\nBiblical, isn’t it?” She paused, and joined in the man’s laugh. “I\nremember--” She stopped abruptly.\n\n“Thieves!” said he, “not in our sense. And yet a fortnight ago this\nsylvan retreat was the scene of murder and sudden death.”\n\n“Yes, Indians,” said the woman; “but they are beaten off and forgotten.\nTroubles do not last here. Did you see the boy? He’s in there, in the\ncorner, getting well of a fearful hacking. Mrs. McChesney says he saved\nher and her brats.”\n\n“Ay, McChesney told me,” said the man. “Let’s have a peep at him.”\n\nIn they came, and I looked on the woman, and would have leaped from\nmy bed had the strength been in me. Superb she was, though her\nclose-fitting travelling gown of green cloth was frayed and torn by the\nbriers, and the beauty of her face enhanced by the marks of I know not\nwhat trials and emotions. Little, dark-pencilled lines under the eyes\nwere nigh robbing these of the haughtiness I had once seen and hated.\nSet high on her hair was a curving, green hat with a feather, ill-suited\nto the wilderness.\n\nI looked on the man. He was as ill-equipped as she. A London tailor\nmust have cut his suit of gray. A single band of linen, soiled by the\njourney, was wound about his throat, and I remember oddly the\nbuttons stuck on his knees and cuffs, and these silk-embroidered in a\ncriss-cross pattern of lighter gray. Some had been torn off. As for his\nface, ‘twas as handsome as ever, for dissipation sat well upon it.\n\nMy thoughts flew back to that day long gone when a friendless boy rode\nup a long drive to a pillared mansion. I saw again the picture. The\nhorse with the craning neck, the liveried servant at the bridle,\nthe listless young gentleman with the shiny boots reclining on the\nhorse-block, and above him, under the portico, the grand lady whose\nlaugh had made me sad. And I remembered, too, the wild, neglected lad\nwho had been to me as a brother, warm-hearted and generous, who had\nshared what he had with a foundling, who had wept with me in my first\ngreat sorrow. Where was he?\n\nFor I was face to face once more with Mrs. Temple and Mr. Harry Riddle!\n\nThe lady started as she gazed at me, and her tired eyes widened. She\nclutched Mr. Riddle’s arm.\n\n“Harry!” she cried, “Harry, he puts me in mind of--of some one--I cannot\nthink.”\n\nMr. Riddle laughed nervously.\n\n“There, there, Sally,” says he, “all brats resemble somebody. I have\nheard you say so a dozen times.”\n\nShe turned upon him an appealing glance.\n\n“Oh!” she said, with a little catch of her breath, “is there no such\nthing as oblivion? Is there a place in the world that is not haunted? I\nam cursed with memory.”\n\n“Or the lack of it,” answered Mr. Riddle, pulling out a silver snuff-box\nfrom his pocket and staring at it ruefully. “Damme, the snuff I fetched\nfrom Paris is gone, all but a pinch. Here is a real tragedy.”\n\n“It was the same in Rome,” the lady continued, unheeding, “when we met\nthe Izards, and at Venice that nasty Colonel Tarleton saw us at the\nopera. In London we must needs run into the Manners from Maryland. In\nParis--”\n\n“In Paris we were safe enough,” Mr. Riddle threw in hastily.\n\n“And why?” she flashed back at him.\n\nHe did not answer that.\n\n“A truce with your fancies, madam,” said he. “Behold a soul of good\nnature! I have followed you through half the civilized countries of\nthe globe--none of them are good enough. You must needs cross the ocean\nagain, and come to the wilds. We nearly die on the trail, are picked\nup by a Samaritan in buckskin and taken into the bosom of his worthy\nfamily. And forsooth, you look at a backwoods urchin, and are nigh to\nswooning.”\n\n“Hush, Harry,” she cried, starting forward and peering into my face; “he\nwill hear you.”\n\n“Tut!” said Harry, “what if he does? London and Paris are words to\nhim. We might as well be speaking French. And I’ll take my oath he’s\nsleeping.”\n\nThe corner where I lay was dark, for the cabin had no windows. And if my\nlife had depended upon speaking, I could have found no fit words then.\n\nShe turned from me, and her mood changed swiftly. For she laughed\nlightly, musically, and put a hand on his shoulder.\n\n“Perchance I am ghost-ridden,” she said.\n\n“They are not ghosts of a past happiness, at all events,” he answered.\n\nShe sat down on a stool before the hearth, and clasping her fingers upon\nher knee looked thoughtfully into the embers of the fire. Presently she\nbegan to speak in a low, even voice, he looking down at her, his feet\napart, his hand thrust backward towards the heat.\n\n“Harry,” she said, “do you remember all our contrivances? How you used\nto hold my hand in the garden under the table, while I talked brazenly\nto Mr. Mason? And how jealous Jack Temple used to get?” She laughed\nagain, softly, always looking at the fire.\n\n“Damnably jealous!” agreed Mr. Riddle, and yawned. “Served him devilish\nright for marrying you. And he was a blind fool for five long years.”\n\n“Yes, blind,” the lady agreed. “How could he have been so blind? How\nwell I recall the day he rode after us in the woods.”\n\n“‘Twas the parson told, curse him!” said Mr. Riddle. “We should have\ngone that night, if your courage had held.”\n\n“My courage!” she cried, flashing a look upwards, “my foresight. A\npretty mess we had made of it without my inheritance. ‘Tis small enough,\nthe Lord knows. In Europe we should have been dregs. We should have\nstarved in the wilderness with you a-farming.”\n\nHe looked down at her curiously.\n\n“Devilish queer talk,” said he, “but while we are in it, I wonder where\nTemple is now. He got aboard the King’s frigate with a price on his\nhead. Williams told me he saw him in London, at White’s. Have--have you\never heard, Sarah?”\n\nShe shook her head, her glance returning to the ashes.\n\n“No,” she answered.\n\n“Faith,” says Mr. Riddle, “he’ll scarce turn up here.”\n\nShe did not answer that, but sat motionless.\n\n“He’ll scarce turn up here, in these wilds,” Mr. Riddle repeated, “and\nwhat I am wondering, Sarah, is how the devil we are to live here.”\n\n“How do these good people live, who helped us when we were starving?”\n\nMr. Riddle flung his hand eloquently around the cabin. There was\nsomething of disgust in the gesture.\n\n“You see!” he said, “love in a cottage.”\n\n“But it is love,” said the lady, in a low tone.\n\nHe broke into laughter.\n\n“Sally,” he cried, “I have visions of you gracing the board at which we\nsat to-day, patting journey-cakes on the hearth, stewing squirrel broth\nwith the same pride that you once planned a rout. Cleaning the pots and\npans, and standing anxious at the doorway staring through a sunbonnet\nfor your lord and master.”\n\n“My lord and master!” said the lady, and there was so much of scorn in\nthe words that Mr. Riddle winced.\n\n“Come,” he said, “I grant now that you could make pans shine like\npier-glasses, that you could cook bacon to a turn--although I would have\nlaid an hundred guineas against it some years ago. What then? Are you to\nbe contented with four log walls? With the intellectual companionship of\nthe McChesneys and their friends? Are you to depend for excitement upon\nthe chances of having the hair neatly cut from your head by red fiends?\nCome, we’ll go back to the Rue St. Dominique, to the suppers and the\ncard parties of the countess. We’ll be rid of regrets for a life upon\nwhich we have turned our backs forever.”\n\nShe shook her head, sadly.\n\n“It’s no use, Harry,” said she, “we’ll never be rid of regrets.”\n\n“We’ll never have a barony like Temple Bow, and races every week, and\ngentry round about. But, damn it, the Rebels have spoiled all that since\nthe war.”\n\n“Those are not the regrets I mean,” answered Mrs. Temple.\n\n“What then, in Heaven’s name?” he cried. “You were not wont to be thus.\nBut now I vow you go beyond me. What then?”\n\nShe did not answer, but sat leaning forward over the hearth, he staring\nat her in angry perplexity. A sound broke the afternoon stillness,--the\npattering of small, bare feet on the puncheons. A tremor shook the\nwoman’s shoulders, and little Tom stood before her, a quaint figure in a\nbutternut smock, his blue eyes questioning. He laid a hand on her arm.\n\nThen a strange thing happened. With a sudden impulse she turned and\nflung her arms about the boy and strained him to her, and kissed his\nbrown hair. He struggled, but when she released him he sat very still\non her knee, looking into her face. For he was a solemn child. The lady\nsmiled at him, and there were two splashes like raindrops on her fair\ncheeks.\n\nAs for Mr. Riddle, he went to the door, looked out, and took a last\npinch of snuff.\n\n“Here is the mistress of the house coming back,” he cried, “and singing\nlike the shepherdess in the opera.”\n\nIt was Polly Ann indeed. At the sound of his mother’s voice, little Tom\njumped down from the lady’s lap and ran past Mr. Riddle at the door.\nMrs. Temple’s thoughts were gone across the mountains.\n\n“And what is that you have under your arm?” said Mr. Riddle, as he gave\nback.\n\n“I’ve fetched some prime bacon fer your supper, sir,” said Polly Ann,\nall rosy from her walk; “what I have ain’t fit to give ye.”\n\nMrs. Temple rose.\n\n“My dear,” she said, “what you have is too good for us. And if you do\nsuch a thing again, I shall be very angry.”\n\n“Lord, ma’am,” exclaimed Polly Ann, “and you use’ ter dainties an’\nsilver an’ linen! Tom is gone to try to git a turkey for ye.” She\npaused, and looked compassionately at the lady. “Bless ye, ma’am, ye’re\nthat tuckered from the mountains! ‘Tis a fearsome journey.”\n\n“Yes,” said the lady, simply, “I am tired.”\n\n“Small wonder!” exclaimed Polly Ann. “To think what ye’ve been\nthrough--yere husband near to dyin’ afore yere eyes, and ye a-reskin’\nyere own life to save him--so Tom tells me. When Tom goes out a-fightin’\nredskins I’m that fidgety I can’t set still. I wouldn’t let him know\nwhat I feel fer the world. But well ye know the pain of it, who love\nyere husband like that.”\n\nThe lady would have smiled bravely, had the strength been given her. She\ntried. And then, with a shudder, she hid her face in her hands.\n\n“Oh, don’t!” she exclaimed, “don’t!”\n\nMr. Riddle went out.\n\n“There, there, ma’am,” she said, “I hedn’t no right ter speak, and ye\nfair worn out.” She drew her gently into a chair. “Set down, ma’am,\nand don’t ye stir tell supper’s ready.” She brushed her eyes with her\nsleeve, and, stepping briskly to my bed, bent over me. “Davy,” she said,\n“Davy, how be ye?”\n\n“Davy!”\n\nIt was the lady’s voice. She stood facing us, and never while I live\nshall I forget that which I saw in her eyes. Some resemblance it bore\nto the look of the hunted deer, but in the animal it is dumb,\nappealing. Understanding made the look of the woman terrible to\nbehold,--understanding, ay, and courage. For she did not lack this last\nquality. Polly Ann gave back in a kind of dismay, and I shivered.\n\n“Yes,” I answered, “I am David Ritchie.”\n\n“You--you dare to judge me!” she cried.\n\nI knew not why she said this.\n\n“To judge you?” I repeated.\n\n“Yes, to judge me,” she answered. “I know you, David Ritchie, and the\nblood that runs in you. Your mother was a foolish--saint” (she laughed),\n“who lifted her eyebrows when I married her brother, John Temple. That\nwas her condemnation of me, and it stung me more than had a thousand\nsermons. A doting saint, because she followed your father into the\nmountain wilds to her death for a whim of his. And your father. A\nCalvinist fanatic who had no mercy on sin, save for that particular\nweakness of his own--”\n\n“Stop, Mrs. Temple!” I cried, lifting up in bed. And to my astonishment\nshe was silenced, looking at me in amazement. “You had your vengeance\nwhen I came to you, when you turned from me with a lift of your\nshoulders at the news of my father’s death. And now--”\n\n“And now?” she repeated questioningly.\n\n“Now I thought you were changed,” I said slowly, for the excitement was\ntelling on me.\n\n“You listened!” she said.\n\n“I pitied you.”\n\n“Oh, pity!” she cried. “My God, that you should pity me!” She\nstraightened, and summoned all the spirit that was in her. “I would\nrather be called a name than have the pity of you and yours.”\n\n“You cannot change it, Mrs. Temple,” I answered, and fell back on the\nnettle-bark sheets. “You cannot change it,” I heard myself repeating,\nas though it were another’s voice. And I knew that Polly Ann was bending\nover me and calling me.\n\n“Where did they go, Polly Ann?” I asked.\n\n“Acrost the Mississippi, to the lands of the Spanish King,” said Polly\nAnn.\n\n“And where in those dominions?” I demanded.\n\n“John Saunders took ‘em as far as the Falls,” Polly Ann answered. “He\n‘lowed they was goin’ to St. Louis. But they never said a word. I reckon\nthey’ll be hunted as long as they live.”\n\nI had thought of them much as I lay on my back recovering from the\nfever,--the fever for which Mrs. Temple was to blame. Yet I bore her\nno malice. And many other thoughts I had, probing back into childhood\nmemories for the solving of problems there.\n\n“I knowed ye come of gentlefolks, Davy,” Polly Ann had said when we\ntalked together.\n\nSo I was first cousin to Nick, and nephew to that selfish gentleman, Mr.\nTemple, in whose affectionate care I had been left in Charlestown by my\nfather. And my father? Who had he been? I remembered the speech that\nhe had used and taught me, and how his neighbors had dubbed him\n“aristocrat.” But Mrs. Temple was gone, and it was not in likelihood\nthat I should ever see her more.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. WE GO TO DANVILLE\n\nTwo years went by, two uneventful years for me, two mighty years for\nKentucky. Westward rolled the tide of emigrants to change her character,\nbut to swell her power. Towns and settlements sprang up in a season and\nflourished, and a man could scarce keep pace with the growth of them.\nDoctors came, and ministers, and lawyers; generals and majors, and\ncaptains and subalterns of the Revolution, to till their grants and to\nfound families. There were gentry, too, from the tide-waters, come to\nretrieve the fortunes which they had lost by their patriotism. There\nwere storekeepers like Mr. Scarlett, adventurers and ne’er-do-weels\nwho hoped to start with a clean slate, and a host of lazy vagrants who\nthought to scratch the soil and find abundance.\n\nI must not forget how, at the age of seventeen, I became a landowner,\nthanks to my name being on the roll of Colonel Clark’s regiment. For,\nin a spirit of munificence, the Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia\nhad awarded to every private in that regiment one hundred and eight\nacres of land on the Ohio River, north of the Falls. Sergeant Thomas\nMcChesney, as a reward for his services in one of the severest campaigns\nin history, received a grant of two hundred and sixteen acres! You who\nwill may look at the plat made by William Clark, Surveyor for the Board\nof Commissioners, and find sixteen acres marked for Thomas McChesney in\nSection 169, and two hundred more in Section 3. Section 3 fronted the\nOhio some distance above Bear Grass Creek, and was, of course, on the\nIllinois shore. As for my own plots, some miles in the interior, I never\nsaw them. But I own them to this day.\n\nI mention these things as bearing on the story of my life, with which I\nmust get on. And, therefore, I may not dwell upon this injustice to the\nmen who won an empire and were flung a bone long afterwards.\n\nIt was early autumn once more, and such a busy week we had had at the\nmill, that Tom was perforce obliged to remain at home and help, though\nhe longed to be gone with Cowan and Ray a-hunting to the southwest. Up\nrides a man named Jarrott, flings himself from his horse, passes the\ntime of day as he watches the grinding, helps Tom to tie up a sack or\ntwo, and hands him a paper.\n\n“What’s this?” says Tom, staring at it blankly.\n\n“Ye won’t blame me, Mac,” answers Mr. Jarrott, somewhat ashamed of his\nrôle of process-server. “‘Tain’t none of my doin’s.”\n\n“Read it, Davy,” said Tom, giving it to me.\n\nI stopped the mill, and, unfolding the paper, read. I remember not\nthe quaint wording of it, save that it was ill-spelled and ill-writ\ngenerally. In short, it was a summons for Tom to appear before the court\nat Danville on a certain day in the following week, and I made out that\na Mr. Neville Colfax was the plaintiff in the matter, and that the suit\nhad to do with land.\n\n“Neville Colfax!” I exclaimed, “that’s the man for whom Mr. Potts was\nagent.”\n\n“Ay, ay,” said Tom, and sat him down on the meal-bags. “Drat the\nvarmint, he kin hev the land.”\n\n“Hev the land?” cried Polly Ann, who had come in upon us. “Hev ye no\nsperrit, Tom McChesney?”\n\n“There’s no chance ag’in the law,” said Tom, hopelessly. “Thar’s Perkins\nhad his land tuck away last year, and Terrell’s moved out, and twenty\nmore I could name. And thar’s Dan’l Boone, himself. Most the rich bottom\nhe tuck up the critters hev got away from him.”\n\n“Ye’ll go to Danville and take Davy with ye and fight it,” answered\nPolly Ann, decidedly. “Davy has a word to say, I reckon. ‘Twas he made\nthe mill and scar’t that Mr. Potts away. I reckon he’ll git us out of\nthis fix.”\n\nMr. Jarrott applauded her courage.\n\n“Ye have the grit, ma’am,” he said, as he mounted his horse again.\n“Here’s luck to ye!”\n\nThe remembrance of Mr. Potts weighed heavily upon my mind during the\nnext week. Perchance Tom would have to pay for this prank likewise.\n‘Twas indeed a foolish, childish thing to have done, and I might have\nknown that it would only have put off the evil day of reckoning. Since\nthen, by reason of the mill site and the business we got by it, the land\nhad become the most valuable in that part of the country. Had I known\nColonel Clark’s whereabouts, I should have gone to him for advice and\ncomfort. As it was, we were forced to await the issue without counsel.\nPolly Ann and I talked it over many times while Tom sat, morose and\nsilent, in a corner. He was the pioneer pure and simple, afraid of no\nman, red or white, in open combat, but defenceless in such matters as\nthis.\n\n“‘Tis Davy will save us, Tom,” said Polly Ann, “with the l’arnin’ he’s\ngot while the corn was grindin’.”\n\nI had, indeed, been reading at the mill while the hopper emptied itself,\nsuch odd books as drifted into Harrodstown. One of these was called\n“Bacon’s Abridgment”; it dealt with law and it puzzled me sorely.\n\n“And the children,” Polly Ann continued,--“ye’ll not make me pick up the\nfour of ‘em, and pack it to Louisiana, because Mr. Colfax wants the land\nwe’ve made for ourselves.”\n\nThere were four of them now, indeed,--the youngest still in the bark\ncradle in the corner. He bore a no less illustrious name than that of\nthe writer of these chronicles.\n\nIt would be hard to say which was the more troubled, Tom or I, that\nwindy morning we set out on the Danville trace. Polly Ann alone had been\nserene,--ay, and smiling and hopeful. She had kissed us each good-by\nimpartially. And we left her, with a future governor of Kentucky on her\nshoulder, tripping lightly down to the mill to grind the McGarrys’ corn.\n\nWhen the forest was cleared at Danville, Justice was housed first.\nShe was not the serene, inexorable dame whom we have seen in pictures\nholding her scales above the jars of earth. Justice at Danville was a\nsomewhat high-spirited, quarrelsome lady who decided matters oftenest\nwith the stroke of a sword. There was a certain dignity about her temple\nwithal,--for instance, if a judge wore linen, that linen must not\nbe soiled. Nor was it etiquette for a judge to lay his own hands in\nchastisement on contemptuous persons, though Justice at Danville\nhad more compassion than her sisters in older communities upon human\nfailings.\n\nThere was a temple built to her “of hewed or sawed logs nine inches\nthick”--so said the specifications. Within the temple was a rude\nplatform which served as a bar, and since Justice is supposed to carry\na torch in her hand, there were no windows,--nor any windows in the jail\nnext door, where some dozen offenders languished on the afternoon that\nTom and I rode into town.\n\nThere was nothing auspicious in the appearance of Danville, and no man\nmight have said then that the place was to be the scene of portentous\nconventions which were to decide the destiny of a State. Here was a\nsprinkling of log cabins, some in the building, and an inn, by courtesy\nso called. Tom and I would have preferred to sleep in the woods near by,\nwith our feet to the blaze; this was partly from motives of economy,\nand partly because Tom, in common with other pioneers, held an inn in\ncontempt. But to come back to our arrival.\n\nIt was a sunny and windy afternoon, and the leaves were flying in\nthe air. Around the court-house was a familiar, buzzing scene,--the\nbackwoodsmen, lounging against the wall or brawling over their claims,\nthe sleek agents and attorneys, and half a dozen of a newer type. These\nwere adventurous young gentlemen of family, some of them lawyers and\nsome of them late officers in the Continental army who had been rewarded\nwith grants of land. These were the patrons of the log tavern which\nstood near by with the blackened stumps around it, where there was much\ncard-playing and roistering, ay, and even duelling, of nights.\n\n“Thar’s Mac,” cried a backwoodsman who was sitting on the court-house\nsteps as we rode up. “Howdy, Mac; be they tryin’ to git your land, too?”\n\n“Howdy, Mac,” said a dozen more, paying a tribute to Tom’s popularity.\nAnd some of them greeted me.\n\n“Is this whar they take a man’s land away?” says Tom, jerking his thumb\nat the open door.\n\nTom had no intention of uttering a witticism, but his words were\nfollowed by loud guffaws from all sides, even the lawyers joining in.\n\n“I reckon this is the place, Tom,” came the answer.\n\n“I reckon I’ll take a peep in thar,” said Tom, leaping off his horse and\nshouldering his way to the door. I followed him, curious. The building\nwas half full. Two elderly gentlemen of grave demeanor sat on stools\nbehind a puncheon table, and near them a young man was writing. Behind\nthe young man was a young gentleman who was closing a speech as we\nentered, and he had spoken with such vehemence that the perspiration\nstood out on his brow. There was a murmur from those listening, and I\nsaw Tom pressing his way to the front.\n\n“Hev any of ye seen a feller named Colfax?” cries Tom, in a loud voice.\n“He says he owns the land I settled, and he ain’t ever seed it.”\n\nThere was a roar of laughter, and even the judges smiled.\n\n“Whar is he?” cries Tom; “said he’d be here to-day.”\n\nAnother gust of laughter drowned his words, and then one of the judges\ngot up and rapped on the table. The gentleman who had just made the\nspeech glared mightily, and I supposed he had lost the effect of it.\n\n“What do you mean by interrupting the court?” cried the judge. “Get out,\nsir, or I’ll have you fined for contempt.”\n\nTom looked dazed. But at that moment a hand was laid on his shoulder,\nand Tom turned.\n\n“Why,” says he, “thar’s no devil if it ain’t the Colonel. Polly Ann told\nme not to let ‘em scar’ me, Colonel.”\n\n“And quite right, Tom,” Colonel Clark answered, smiling. He turned to\nthe judges. “If your Honors please,” said he, “this gentleman is an old\nsoldier of mine, and unused to the ways of court. I beg your Honors to\nexcuse him.”\n\nThe judges smiled back, and the Colonel led us out of the building.\n\n“Now, Tom,” said he, after he had given me a nod and a kind word, “I\nknow this Mr. Colfax, and if you will come into the tavern this evening\nafter court, we’ll see what can be done. I have a case of my own at\npresent.”\n\nTom was very grateful. He spent the remainder of the daylight hours with\nother friends of his, shooting at a mark near by, serenely confident\nof the result of his case now that Colonel Clark had a hand in it. Tom\nbeing one of the best shots in Kentucky, he had won two beaver skins\nbefore the early autumn twilight fell. As for me, I had an afternoon of\nexcitement in the court, fascinated by the marvels of its procedures, by\nthe impassioned speeches of its advocates, by the gravity of its judges.\nAmbition stirred within me.\n\nThe big room of the tavern was filled with men in heated talk over the\nday’s doings, some calling out for black betty, some for rum, and some\ndemanding apple toddies. The landlord’s slovenly negro came in with\ncandles, their feeble rays reënforcing the firelight and revealing the\nmud-chinked walls. Tom and I had barely sat ourselves down at a table in\na corner, when in came Colonel Clark. Beside him was a certain swarthy\ngentleman whom I had noticed in the court, a man of some thirty-five\nyears, with a fine, fleshy face and coal-black hair. His expression was\nnot one to give us the hope of an amicable settlement,--in fact, he had\nthe scowl of a thundercloud. He was talking quite angrily, and seemed\nnot to heed those around him.\n\n“Why the devil should I see the man, Clark?” he was saying.\n\nThe Colonel did not answer until they had stopped in front of us.\n\n“Major Colfax,” said he, “this is Sergeant Tom McChesney, one of the\nbest friends I have in Kentucky. I think a vast deal of Tom, Major. He\nwas one of the few that never failed me in the Illinois campaign. He\nis as honest as the day; you will find him plain-spoken if he speaks at\nall, and I have great hopes that you will agree. Tom, the Major and\nI are boyhood friends, and for the sake of that friendship he has\nconsented to this meeting.”\n\n“I fear that your kind efforts will be useless, Colonel,” Major Colfax\nput in, rather tartly. “Mr. McChesney not only ignores my rights, but\nwas near to hanging my agent.”\n\n“What?” says Colonel Clark.\n\nI glanced at Tom. However helpless he might be in a court, he could\nbe counted on to stand up stanchly in a personal argument. His retorts\nwould certainly not be brilliant, but they surely would be dogged. Major\nColfax had begun wrong.\n\n“I reckon ye’ve got no rights that I know on,” said Tom. “I cleart the\nland and settled it, and I have a better right to it nor any man. And\nI’ve got a grant fer it.”\n\n“A Henderson grant!” cried the Major; “‘tis so much worthless paper.”\n\n“I reckon it’s good enough fer me,” answered Tom. “It come from those\nwho blazed their way out here and druv the redskins off. I don’t know\nnothin’ about this newfangled law, but ‘tis a queer thing to my thinkin’\nif them that fit fer a place ain’t got the fust right to it.”\n\nMajor Colfax turned to Colonel Clark with marked impatience.\n\n“I told you it would be useless, Clark,” said he. “I care not a fig for\na few paltry acres, and as God hears me I’m a reasonable man.” (He did\nnot look it then.) “But I swear by the evangels I’ll let no squatter\nhave the better of me. I did not serve Virginia for gold or land, but I\nlost my fortune in that service, and before I know it these backwoodsmen\nwill have every acre of my grant. It’s an old story,” said Mr. Colfax,\nhotly, “and why the devil did we fight England if it wasn’t that every\nman should have his rights? By God, I’ll not be frightened or wheedled\nout of mine. I sent an agent to Kentucky to deal politely and reasonably\nwith these gentry. What did they do to him? Some of them threw him out\nneck and crop. And if I am not mistaken,” said Major Colfax, fixing\na piercing eye upon Tom, “if I am not mistaken, it was this worthy\nsergeant of yours who came near to hanging him, and made the poor devil\nflee Kentucky for his life.”\n\nThis remark brought me near to an untimely laugh at the remembrance of\nMr. Potts, and this though I was far too sober over the outcome of the\nconference. Colonel Clark seized hold of a chair and pushed it under\nMajor Colfax.\n\n“Sit down, gentlemen, we are not so far apart,” said the Colonel,\ncoolly. The slovenly negro lad passing at that time, he caught him by\nthe sleeve. “Here, boy, a bowl of toddy, quick. And mind you brew it\nstrong. Now, Tom,” said he, “what is this fine tale about a hanging?”\n\n“‘Twan’t nothin’,” said Tom.\n\n“You tell me you didn’t try to hang Mr. Potts!” cried Major Colfax.\n\n“I tell you nothin’,” said Tom, and his jaw was set more stubbornly than\never.\n\nMajor Colfax glanced at Colonel Clark.\n\n“You see!” he said a little triumphantly.\n\nI could hold my tongue no longer.\n\n“Major Colfax is unjust, sir,” I cried. “‘Twas Tom saved the man from\nhanging.”\n\n“Eh?” says Colonel Clark, turning to me sharply. “So you had a hand in\nthis, Davy. I might have guessed as much.”\n\n“Who the devil is this?” says Mr. Colfax.\n\n“A sort of ward of mine,” answers the Colonel. “Drummer boy, financier,\nstrategist, in my Illinois campaign. Allow me to present to you, Major,\nMr. David Ritchie. When my men objected to marching through ice-skimmed\nwater up to their necks, Mr. Ritchie showed them how.”\n\n“God bless my soul!” exclaimed the Major, staring at me from under his\nblack eyebrows, “he was but a child.”\n\n“With an old head on his shoulders,” said the Colonel, and his banter\nmade me flush.\n\nThe negro boy arriving with the toddy, Colonel Clark served out three\ngenerous gourdfuls, a smaller one for me. “Your health, my friends, and\nI drink to a peaceful settlement.”\n\n“You may drink to the devil if you like,” says Major Colfax, glaring at\nTom.\n\n“Come, Davy,” said Colonel Clark, when he had taken half the gourd,\n“let’s have the tale. I’ll warrant you’re behind this.”\n\nI flushed again, and began by stammering. For I had a great fear that\nMajor Colfax’s temper would fly into bits when he heard it.\n\n“Well, sir,” said I, “I was grinding corn at the mill when the man\ncame. I thought him a smooth-mannered person, and he did not give his\nbusiness. He was just for wheedling me. ‘And was this McChesney’s mill?’\nsaid he. ‘Ay,’ said I. ‘Thomas McChesney?’ ‘Ay,’ said I. Then he was all\nfor praise of Thomas McChesney. ‘Where is he?’ said he. ‘He is at the\nfar pasture,’ said I, ‘and may be looked for any moment.’ Whereupon\nhe sits down and tries to worm out of me the business of the mill, the\nyield of the land. After that he begins to talk about the great people\nhe knows, Sevier and Shelby and Robertson and Boone and the like. Ay,\nand his intimates, the Randolphs and the Popes and the Colfaxes\nin Virginia. ‘Twas then I asked him if he knew Colonel Campbell of\nAbingdon.”\n\n“And what deviltry was that?” demanded the Colonel, as he dipped himself\nmore of the toddy.\n\n“I’ll come to it, sir. Yes, Colonel Campbell was his intimate, and\nranted if he did not tarry a week with him at Abingdon on his journeys.\nAfter that he follows me to the cabin, and sees Polly Ann and Tom\nand the children on the floor poking a ‘possum. ‘Ah,’ says he, in his\nsoftest voice, ‘a pleasant family scene. And this is Mr. McChesney?’\n‘I’m your man,’ says Tom. Then he praised the mill site and the land all\nover again. ‘‘Tis good enough for a farmer,’ says Tom. ‘Who holds under\nHenderson’s grant,’ I cried. ‘‘Twas that you wished to say an hour ago,’\nand I saw I had caught him fair.”\n\n“By the eternal!” cried Colonel Clark, bringing down his fist upon the\ntable. “And what then?”\n\nI glanced at Major Colfax, but for the life of me I could make nothing\nof his look.\n\n“And what did your man say?” said Colonel Clark.\n\n“He called on the devil to bite me, sir,” I answered. The Colonel put\ndown his gourd and began to laugh. The Major was looking at me fixedly.\n\n“And what then?” said the Colonel.\n\n“It was then Polly Ann called him a thief to take away the land Tom\nhad fought for and paid for and tilled. The man was all politeness once\nmore, said that the matter was unfortunate, and that a new and good\ntitle might be had for a few skins.”\n\n“He said that?” interrupted Major Colfax, half rising in his chair. “He\nwas a damned scoundrel.”\n\n“So I thought, sir,” I answered.\n\n“The devil you did!” said the Major.\n\n“Tut, Colfax,” said the Colonel, pulling him by the sleeve of his\ngreatcoat, “sit down and let the lad finish. And then?”\n\n“Mr. Boone had told me of a land agent who had made off with Colonel\nCampbell’s silver spoons from Abingdon, and how the Colonel had ridden\neast and west after him for a week with a rope hanging on his saddle. I\nbegan to tell this story, and instead of the description of Mr. Boone’s\nman, I put in that of Mr. Potts,--in height some five feet nine, spare,\nof sallow complexion and a green greatcoat.”\n\nMajor Colfax leaped up in his chair.\n\n“Great Jehovah!” he shouted, “you described the wrong man.”\n\nColonel Clark roared with laughter, thereby spilling some of his toddy.\n\n“I’ll warrant he did so,” he cried; “and I’ll warrant your agent went\nwhite as birch bark. Go on, Davy.”\n\n“There’s not a great deal more, sir,” I answered, looking apprehensively\nat Major Colfax, who still stood. “The man vowed I lied, but Tom laid\nhold of him and was for hurrying him off to Harrodstown at once.”\n\n“Which would ill have suited your purpose,” put in the Colonel. “And\nwhat did you do with him?”\n\n“We put him in a loft, sir, and then I told Tom that he was not\nCampbell’s thief at all. But I had a craving to scare the man out of\nKentucky. So I rode off to the neighbors and gave them the tale, and\nbade them come after nightfall as though to hang Campbell’s thief, which\nthey did, and they were near to smashing the door trying to get in the\ncabin. Tom told them the rascal had escaped, but they must needs come\nin and have jigs and toddies until midnight. When they were gone, and we\ncalled down the man from the loft, he was in such a state that he could\nscarce find the rungs of the ladder with his feet. He rode away into\nthe night, and that was the last we heard of him. Tom was not to blame,\nsir.”\n\nColonel Clark was speechless. And when for the moment he would conquer\nhis mirth, a glance at Major Colfax would set him off again in laughter.\nI was puzzled. I thought my Colonel more human than of old.\n\n“How now, Colfax?” he cried, giving a poke to the Major’s ribs; “you\nhold the sequel to this farce.”\n\nThe Major’s face was purple,--with what emotion I could not say.\nSuddenly he swung full at me.\n\n“Do you mean to tell me that you were the general of this hoax--you?” he\ndemanded in a strange voice.\n\n“The thing seemed an injustice to me, sir,” I replied in self-defence,\n“and the man a rascal.”\n\n“A rascal!” cried the Major, “a knave, a poltroon, a simpleton! And\nhe came to me with no tale of having been outwitted by a stripling.”\nWhereupon Major Colfax began to shake, gently at first, and presently\nhe was in such a gale of laughter that I looked on him in amazement,\nColonel Clark joining in again. The Major’s eye rested at length upon\nTom, and gradually he grew calm.\n\n“McChesney,” said he, “we’ll have no bickerings in court among soldiers.\nThe land is yours, and to-morrow my attorney shall give you a deed of\nit. Your hand, McChesney.”\n\nThe stubbornness vanished from Tom’s face, and there came instead a\ndazed expression as he thrust a great, hard hand into the Major’s.\n\n“‘Twan’t the land, sir,” he stammered; “these varmints of settlers is\ngittin’ thick as flies in July. ‘Twas Polly Ann. I reckon I’m obleeged\nto ye, Major.”\n\n“There, there,” said the Major, “I thank the Lord I came to Kentucky to\nsee for myself. Damn the land. I have plenty more,--and little else.” He\nturned quizzically to Colonel Clark, revealing a line of strong, white\nteeth. “Suppose we drink a health to your drummer boy,” said he, lifting\nup his gourd.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. I CROSS THE MOUNTAINS ONCE MORE\n\n “‘Tis what ye’ve a right to, Davy,” said Polly Ann, and she handed me a\nlittle buckskin bag on which she had been sewing. I opened it with\ntrembling fingers, and poured out, chinking on the table, such a motley\ncollection of coins as was never seen,--Spanish milled dollars, English\nsovereigns and crowns and shillings, paper issues of the Confederacy,\nand I know not what else. Tom looked on with a grin, while little Tom\nand Peggy reached out their hands in delight, their mother vigorously\nblocking their intentions.\n\n“Ye’ve earned it yerself,” said Polly Ann, forestalling my protest;\n“‘tis what ye got by the mill, and I’ve laid it by bit by bit for yer\neddication.”\n\n“And what do you get?” I cried, striving by feigned anger to keep the\ntears back from my eyes. “Have you no family to support?”\n\n“Faith,” she answered, “we have the mill that ye gave us, and the farm,\nand Tom’s rifle. I reckon we’ll fare better than ye think, tho’ we’ll\nmiss ye sore about the place.”\n\nI picked out two sovereigns from the heap, dropped them in the bag, and\nthrust it into my hunting shirt.\n\n“There,” said I, my voice having no great steadiness, “not a penny more.\nI’ll keep the bag for your sake, Polly Ann, and I’ll take the mare for\nTom’s.”\n\nShe had had a song on her lips ever since our coming back from Danville,\nseven days agone, a song on her lips and banter on her tongue, as she\nmade me a new hunting shirt and breeches for the journey across the\nmountains. And now with a sudden movement she burst into tears and flung\nher arms about my neck.\n\n“Oh, Davy, ‘tis no time to be stubborn,” she sobbed, “and eddication\nis a costly thing. Ever sence I found ye on the trace, years ago, I’ve\nthought of ye one day as a great man. And when ye come back to us so big\nand l’arned, I’d wish to be saying with pride that I helped ye.”\n\n“And who else, Polly Ann?” I faltered, my heart racked with the parting.\n“You found me a homeless waif, and you gave me a home and a father and\nmother.”\n\n“Davy, ye’ll not forget us when ye’re great, I know ye’ll not. ‘Tis not\nin ye.”\n\nShe stood back and smiled at me through her tears. The light of heaven\nwas in that smile, and I have dreamed of it even since age has crept\nupon me. Truly, God sets his own mark on the pure in heart, on the\nunselfish.\n\nI glanced for the last time around the rude cabin, every timber of which\nwas dedicated to our sacrifices and our love: the fireplace with its\nrough stones, on the pegs the quaint butternut garments which Polly Ann\nhad stitched, the baby in his bark cradle, the rough bedstead and the\nlittle trundle pushed under it,--and the very homely odor of the place\nis dear to me yet. Despite the rigors and the dangers of my life here,\nshould I ever again find such happiness and peace in the world? The\nchildren clung to my knees; and with a “God bless ye, Davy, and come\nback to us,” Tom squeezed my hand until I winced with pain. I leaped on\nthe mare, and with blinded eyes rode down the familiar trail, past the\nmill, to Harrodsburg.\n\nThere Mr. Neville Colfax was waiting to take me across the mountains.\n\nThere is a story in every man’s life, like the kernel in the shell of\na hickory nut. I am ill acquainted with the arts of a biographer, but\nI seek to give in these pages little of the shell and the whole of the\nkernel of mine. ‘Twould be unwise and tiresome to recount the journey\nover the bare mountains with my new friend and benefactor. He was a\nstrange gentleman, now jolly enough to make me shake with laughter and\nforget the sorrow of my parting, now moody for a night and a day; now\nhe was all sweetness, now all fire; now he was abstemious, now\nself-indulgent and prodigal. He had a will like flint, and under it a\nsoft heart. Cross his moods, and he hated you. I never thought to cross\nthem, therefore he called me Davy, and his friendliness grew with\nour journey. His anger turned against rocks and rivers, landlords and\nemigrants, but never against me. And for this I was silently thankful.\n\nAnd how had he come to take me over the mountains, and to put me in the\nway of studying law? Mindful of the kernel of my story, I have shortened\nthe chapter to tell you out of the proper place. Major Colfax had made\nTom and me sup with himself and Colonel Clark at the inn in Danville.\nAnd so pleased had the Major professed himself with my story of having\noutwitted his agent, that he must needs have more of my adventures.\nColonel Clark gave him some, and Tom,--his tongue loosed by the\ntoddy,--others. And the Colonel added to the debt I owed him by\nsuggesting that Major Colfax take me to Virginia and recommend me to a\nlawyer there.\n\n“Nay,” cried the Major, “I will do more. I like the lad, for he\nis modest despite the way you have paraded him. I have an uncle in\nRichmond, Judge Wentworth, to whom I will take him in person. And when\nthe Judge has done with him, if he is not flayed and tattooed with\nBlackstone, you may flay and tattoo me.”\n\nThus did I break through my environment. And it was settled that I\nshould meet the Major in seven days at Harrodstown.\n\nOnce in the journey did the Major make mention of a subject which had\ntroubled me.\n\n“Davy,” said he, “Clark has changed. He is not the same man he was when\nI saw him in Williamsburg demanding supplies for his campaign.”\n\n“Virginia has used him shamefully, sir,” I answered, and suddenly there\ncame flooding to my mind things I had heard the Colonel say in the\ncampaign.\n\n“Commonwealths have short memories,” said the Major; “they will accept\nany sacrifice with a smile. Shakespeare, I believe, speaks of royal\ningratitude--he knew not commonwealths. Clark was close-lipped once, not\ngiven to levity and--to toddy. There, there, he is my friend as well as\nyours, and I will prove it by pushing his cause in Virginia. Is yours\nScotch anger? Then the devil fend me from it. A monarch would have\ngiven him fifty thousand acres on the Wabash, a palace, and a sufficient\nannuity. Virginia has given him a sword, eight thousand wild acres to be\nsure, repudiated the debts of his army, and left him to starve. Is there\nno room for a genius in our infant military establishment?”\n\nAt length, as Christmas drew near, we came to Major Colfax’s seat, some\nforty miles out of the town of Richmond. It was called Neville’s Grange,\nthe Major’s grandfather having so named it when he came out from England\nsome sixty years before. It was a huge, rambling, draughty house of\nwood,--mortgaged, so the Major cheerfully informed me, thanks to the\npatriotism of the family. At Neville’s Grange the Major kept a somewhat\nroisterous bachelor’s hall. The place was overrun with negroes and dogs,\nand scarce a night went by that there was not merrymaking in the house\nwith the neighbors. The time passed pleasantly enough until one frosty\nJanuary morning Major Colfax had a twinge of remembrance, cried out for\nhorses, took me into Richmond, and presented me to that very learned and\ndecorous gentleman, Judge Wentworth.\n\nMy studies began within the hour of my arrival.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. I MEET AN OLD BEDFELLOW\n\nI shall burden no one with the dry chronicles of a law office. The\nacquirement of learning is a slow process in life, and perchance a\nslower one in the telling. I lacked not application during the three\nyears of my stay in Richmond, and to earn my living I worked at such odd\ntasks as came my way.\n\nThe Judge resembled Major Colfax in but one trait: he was choleric. But\nhe was painstaking and cautious, and I soon found out that he looked\naskance upon any one whom his nephew might recommend. He liked the\nMajor, but he vowed him to be a roisterer and spendthrift, and one day,\nsome months after my advent, the Judge asked me flatly how I came to\nfall in with Major Colfax. I told him. At the end of this conversation\nhe took my breath away by bidding me come to live with him. Like many\nlawyers of that time, he had a little house in one corner of his grounds\nfor his office. It stood under great spreading trees, and there I was\nwont to sit through many a summer day wrestling with the authorities. In\nthe evenings we would have political arguments, for the Confederacy was\nin a seething state between the Federalists and the Republicans over\nthe new Constitution, now ratified. Between the Federalists and the\nJacobins, I would better say, for the virulence of the French Revolution\nwas soon to be reflected among the parties on our side. Kentucky,\nswelled into an unmanageable territory, was come near to rebellion\nbecause the government was not strong enough to wrest from Spain the\nfree navigation of the Mississippi.\n\nAnd yet I yearned to go back, and looked forward eagerly to the time\nwhen I should have stored enough in my head to gain admission to the\nbar. I was therefore greatly embarrassed, when my examinations came, by\nan offer from Judge Wentworth to stay in Richmond and help him with his\npractice. It was an offer not to be lightly set aside, and yet I had\nmade up my mind. He flew into a passion because of my desire to return\nto a wild country of outlaws and vagabonds.\n\n“Why, damme,” he cried, “Kentucky and this pretty State of Franklin\nwhich desired to chip off from North Carolina are traitorous places.\nDisloyal to Congress! Intriguing with a Spanish minister and the Spanish\ngovernor of Louisiana to secede from their own people and join the\nKing of Spain. Bah!” he exclaimed, “if our new Federal Constitution\nis adopted I would hang Jack Sevier of Franklin and your Kentuckian\nWilkinson to the highest trees west of the mountains.”\n\nI can see the little gentleman as he spoke, his black broadcloth coat\nand lace ruffles, his hand clutching the gold head of his cane, his face\nscrewed up with indignation under his white wig. It was on a Sunday, and\nhe was standing by the lilac bushes on the lawn in front of his square\nbrick house.\n\n“David,” said he, more calmly, “I trust I have taught you something\nbesides the law. I trust I have taught you that a strong Federal\ngovernment alone will be the salvation of our country.”\n\n“You cannot blame Kentucky greatly, sir,” said I, feeling that I must\nstand up for my friends. “The Federal government has done little enough\nfor its people, and treated them to a deal of neglect. They won that\nwestern country for themselves with no Federal nor Virginia or North\nCarolina troops to help them. No man east of the mountains knows what\nthat fight has been. No man east of the mountains knows the horror of\nthat Indian warfare. This government gives them no protection now. Nay,\nCongress cannot even procure for them an outlet for their commerce.\nThey must trade or perish. Spain closes the Mississippi, arrests our\nmerchants, seizes their goods, and often throws them into prison. No\nwonder they scorn the Congress as weak and impotent.”\n\nThe Judge stared at me aghast. It was the first time I had dared oppose\nhim on this subject.\n\n“What,” he sputtered, “what? You are a Separatist,--you whom I have\nreceived into the bosom of my family!” Seizing the cane at the middle,\nhe brandished it in my face.\n\n“Don’t misunderstand me, sir,” said I. “You have given me books to\nread, and have taught me what may be the destiny of our nation on this\ncontinent. But you must forgive a people whose lives have been spent in\na fierce struggle for their homes, whose families have nearly all lost\nsome member by massacre, who are separated by hundreds of miles of\nwilderness from you.”\n\nHe looked at me speechless, and turned and walked into the house. I\nthought I had sinned past forgiveness, and I was beyond description\nuncomfortable, for he had been like a parent to me. But the next\nmorning, at half after seven, he walked into the little office and laid\ndown some gold pieces on my table. Gold was very scarce in those days.\n\n“They are for your journey, David,” said he. “My only comfort in your\ngoing back is that you may grow up to put some temperance into their\nwild heads. I have a commission for you at Jonesboro, in what was once\nthe unspeakable State of Franklin. You can stop there on your way to\nKentucky.” He drew from his pocket a great bulky letter, addressed to\n“Thomas Wright, Esquire, Barrister-at-law in Jonesboro, North Carolina.”\nFor the good gentleman could not bring himself to write Franklin.\n\nIt was late in September of the year 1788 when I set out on my homeward\nway--for Kentucky was home to me. I was going back to Polly Ann and\nTom, and visions of that home-coming rose before my eyes as I rode. In\na packet in my saddle-bags were some dozen letters which Mr. Wrenn, the\nschoolmaster at Harrodstown, had writ at Polly Ann’s bidding. I have the\nletters yet. For Mr. Wrenn was plainly an artist, and had set down on\nthe paper the words just as they had flowed from her heart. Ay, and\nthere was news in the letters, though not surprising news among those\npioneer families whom God blessed so abundantly. Since David Ritchie\nMcChesney (I mention the name with pride) had risen above the\nnecessities of a bark cradle, two more had succeeded him, a brother\nand a sister. I spurred my horse onward, and thought impatiently of the\nweary leagues between my family and me.\n\nI have often pictured myself on that journey. I was twenty-one years\nof age, though one would have called me older. My looks were nothing to\nboast of, and I was grown up tall and weedy, so that I must have made\nquite a comical sight, with my long legs dangling on either side of the\npony. I wore a suit of gray homespun, and in my saddle-bags I carried\nfour precious law books, the stock in trade which my generous patron had\ngiven me. But as I mounted the slopes of the mountains my spirits rose\ntoo at the prospect of the life before me. The woods were all aflame\nwith color, with wine and amber and gold, and the hills wore the misty\nmantle of shadowy blue so dear to my youthful memory. As I left the rude\ntaverns of a morning and jogged along the heights, I watched the vapors\nrise and roll away from the valleys far beneath, and saw great flocks of\nducks and swans and cackling geese darkening the air in their southward\nflight. Strange that I fell in with no company, for the trail leading\ninto the Tennessee country was widened and broadened beyond belief,\nand everywhere I came upon blackened fires and abandoned lean-tos, and\nrefuse bones gnawed by the wolves and bleached by the weather. I slept\nin some of these lean-tos, with my fire going brightly, indifferent to\nthe howl of wolves in chase or the scream of a panther pouncing on its\nprey. For I was born of the wilderness. It had no terrors for me, nor\ndid I ever feel alone. The great cliffs with their clinging, gnarled\ntrees, the vast mountains clothed in the motley colors of the autumn,\nthe sweet and smoky smell of the Indian summer,--all were dear to me.\n\nAs I drew near to Jonesboro my thoughts began to dwell upon that strange\nand fascinating man who had entertained Polly Ann and Tom and me so\nlavishly on our way to Kentucky,--Captain John Sevier. For he had made\na great noise in the world since then, and the wrath of such men as my\nlate patron was heavy upon him. Yes, John Sevier, Nollichucky Jack, had\nbeen a king in all but name since I had seen him, the head of such\na principality as stirred the blood to read about. It comprised the\nWatauga settlement among the mountains of what is now Tennessee, and was\ncalled prosaically (as is the wont of the Anglo-Saxon) the free State\nof Franklin. There were certain conservative and unimaginative souls\nin this mountain principality who for various reasons held their old\nallegiance to the State of North Carolina. One Colonel Tipton led these\nloyalist forces, and armed partisans of either side had for some years\nridden up and down the length of the land, burning and pillaging and\nslaying. We in Virginia had heard of two sets of courts in Franklin, of\ntwo sets of legislators. But of late the rumor had grown persistently\nthat Nollichucky Jack was now a kind of fugitive, and that he had\npassed the summer pleasantly enough fighting Indians in the vicinity of\nNick-a-jack Cave.\n\nIt was court day as I rode into the little town of Jonesboro, the air\nsparkling like a blue diamond over the mountain crests, and I drew deep\ninto my lungs once more the scent of the frontier life I had loved\nso well. In the streets currents of excited men flowed and backed and\neddied, backwoodsmen and farmers in the familiar hunting shirts of hide\nor homespun, and lawyers in dress less rude. A line of horses stood\nkicking and switching their tails in front of the log tavern, rough\ncarts and wagons had been left here and there with their poles on the\nground, and between these, piles of skins were heaped up and bags of\ncorn and grain. The log meeting-house was deserted, but the court-house\nwas the centre of such a swirling crowd as I had often seen at\nHarrodstown. Now there are brawls and brawls, and I should have thought\nwith shame of my Kentucky bringing-up had I not perceived that this was\nno ordinary court day, and that an unusual excitement was in the wind.\n\nTying my horse, and making my way through the press in front of the\ntavern door, I entered the common room, and found it stifling, brawling\nand drinking going on apace. Scarce had I found a seat before the whole\nroom was emptied by one consent, all crowding out of the door after\ntwo men who began a rough-and-tumble fight in the street. I had seen\nrough-and-tumble fights in Kentucky, and if I have forborne to speak of\nthem it is because there always has been within me a loathing for them.\nAnd so I sat quietly in the common room until the landlord came. I asked\nhim if he could direct me to Mr. Wright’s house, as I had a letter for\nthat gentleman. His answer was to grin at me incredulously.\n\n“I reckoned you wah’nt from these parts,” said he. “Wright’s--out o’\ntown.”\n\n“What is the excitement?” I demanded.\n\nHe stared at me.\n\n“Nollichucky Jack’s been heah, in Jonesboro, young man,” said he.\n\n“What,” I exclaimed, “Colonel Sevier?”\n\n“Ay, Sevier,” he repeated. “With Martin and Tipton and all the Caroliny\nmen right heah, having a council of mility officers in the court-house,\nin rides Jack with his frontier boys like a whirlwind. He bean’t afeard\nof ‘em, and a bench warrant out ag’in him for high treason. Never seed\nsech a recklessness. Never had sech a jamboree sence I kept the tavern.\nThey was in this here room most of the day, and they was five fights\nbefore they set down to dinner.”\n\n“And Colonel Tipton?” I said.\n\n“Oh, Tipton,” said he, “he hain’t afeard neither, but he hain’t got men\nenough.”\n\n“And where is Sevier now?” I demanded.\n\n“How long hev you ben in town?” was his answer.\n\nI told him.\n\n“Wal,” said he, shifting his tobacco from one sallow cheek to the other,\n“I reckon he and his boys rud out just afore you come in. Mark me,” he\nadded, “when I tell ye there’ll be trouble yet. Tipton and Martin and\nthe Caroliny folks is burnin’ mad with Chucky Jack for the murder of\nCorn Tassel and other peaceful chiefs. But Jack hez a wild lot with\nhim,--some of the Nollichucky Cave traders, and there’s one young lad\nthat looks like he was a gentleman once. I reckon Jack himself wouldn’t\nlike to get into a fight with him. He’s a wild one. Great Goliah,” he\nexclaimed, running to the door, “ef thar ain’t a-goin’ to be another\nfight! Never seed sech a day in Jonesboro.”\n\nI likewise ran to the door, and this fight interested me. There was\na great, black-bearded mountaineer-farmer-desperado in the midst of a\ncircle, pouring out a torrent of abuse at a tall young man.\n\n“That thar’s Hump Gibson,” said the landlord, genially pointing out the\nblack-bearded ruffian, “and the young lawyer feller hez git a jedgment\nag’in him. He’s got spunk, but I reckon Hump ‘ll t’ar the innards out’n\nhim ef he stands thar a great while.”\n\n“Ye’ll git jedgment ag’in me, ye Caroliny splinter, will ye?” yelled Mr.\nGibson, with an oath. “I’ll pay Bill Wilder the skins when I git ready,\nand all the pinhook lawyers in Washington County won’t budge me a mite.”\n\n“You’ll pay Bill Wilder or go to jail, by the eternal,” cried the young\nman, quite as angrily, whereupon I looked upon him with a mixture of\nadmiration and commiseration, with a gulping certainty in my throat that\nI was about to see murder done. He was a strange young man, with the\nrare marked look that would compel even a poor memory to pick him out\nagain. For example, he was very tall and very slim, with red hair blown\nevery which way over a high and towering forehead that seemed as long\nas the face under it. The face, too, was long, and all freckled by the\nweather. The blue eyes held me in wonder, and these blazed with such\nprodigious wrath that, if a look could have killed, Hump Gibson would\nhave been stricken on the spot. Mr. Gibson was, however, very much\nalive.\n\n“Skin out o’ here afore I kill ye,” he shouted, and he charged at the\nslim young man like a buffalo, while the crowd held its breath. I, who\nhad looked upon cruel sights in my day, was turning away with a kind\nof sickening when I saw the slim young man dodge the rush. He did more.\nWith two strides of his long legs he reached the fence, ripped off the\ntopmost rail, and his huge antagonist, having changed his direction and\ncoming at him with a bellow, was met with the point of a scantling in\nthe pit of his stomach, and Mr. Gibson fell heavily to the ground. It\nhad all happened in a twinkling, and there was a moment’s lull while the\nminds of the onlookers needed readjustment, and then they gave vent to\necstasies of delight.\n\n“Great Goliah!” cried the landlord, breathlessly, “he shet him up jest\nlike a jack-knife.”\n\nAwe-struck, I looked at the tall young man, and he was the very essence\nof wrath. Unmindful of the plaudits, he stood brandishing the fence-rail\nover the great, writhing figure on the ground. And he was slobbering. I\nrecall that this fact gave a twinge to something in my memory.\n\n“Come on, Hump Gibson,” he cried, “come on!”--at which the crowd went\nwild with pure joy. Witticisms flew.\n\n“Thought ye was goin’ to eat ‘im up, Hump?” said a friend.\n\n“Ye ain’t hed yer meal yet, Hump,” reminded another.\n\nMr. Hump Gibson arose slowly out of the dust, yet he did not stand\nstraight.\n\n“Come on, come on!” cried the young lawyer-fellow, and he thrust the\npoint of the rail within a foot of Mr. Gibson’s stomach.\n\n“Come on, Hump!” howled the crowd, but Mr. Gibson stood irresolute. He\nlacked the supreme test of courage which was demanded on this occasion.\nThen he turned and walked away very slowly, as though his pace might\nmitigate in some degree the shame of his retreat. The young man flung\naway the fence-rail, and, thrusting aside the overzealous among his\nadmirers, he strode past me into the tavern, his anger still hot.\n\n“Hooray fer Jackson!” they shouted. “Hooray fer Andy Jackson!”\n\nAndy Jackson! Then I knew. Then I remembered a slim, wild, sandy-haired\nboy digging his toes in the red mud long ago at the Waxhaws Settlement.\nAnd I recalled with a smile my own fierce struggle at the schoolhouse\nwith the same boy, and how his slobbering had been my salvation. I\nturned and went in after him with the landlord, who was rubbing his\nhands with glee.\n\n“I reckon Hump won’t come crowin’ round heah any more co’t days, Mr.\nJackson,” said our host.\n\nBut Mr. Jackson swept the room with his eyes and then glared at the\nlandlord so that he gave back.\n\n“Where’s my man?” he demanded.\n\n“Your man, Mr. Jackson?” stammered the host.\n\n“Great Jehovah!” cried Mr. Jackson, “I believe he’s afraid to race. He\nhad a horse that could show heels to my Nancy, did he? And he’s gone,\nyou say?”\n\nA light seemed to dawn on the landlord’s countenance.\n\n“God bless ye, Mr. Jackson!” he cried, “ye don’t mean that young\ndaredevil that was with Sevier?”\n\n“With Sevier?” says Jackson.\n\n“Ay,” says the landlord; “he’s been a-fightin with Sevier all summer,\nand I reckon he ain’t afeard of nothin’ any more than you. Wait--his\nname was Temple--Nick Temple, they called him.”\n\n“Nick Temple!” I cried, starting forward.\n\n“Where’s he gone?” said Mr. Jackson. “He was going to bet me a six-forty\nhe has at Nashboro that his horse could beat mine on the Greasy Cove\ntrack. Where’s he gone?”\n\n“Gone!” said the landlord, apologetically, “Nollichucky Jack and his\nboys left town an hour ago.”\n\n“Is he a man of honor or isn’t he?” said Mr. Jackson, fiercely.\n\n“Lord, sir, I only seen him once, but I’d stake my oath on it.”\n\n“Do you mean to say Mr. Temple has been here--Nicholas Temple?” I said.\n\nThe bewildered landlord turned towards me helplessly.\n\n“Who the devil are you, sir?” cried Mr. Jackson.\n\n“Tell me what this Mr. Temple was like,” said I.\n\nThe landlord’s face lighted up.\n\n“Faith, a thoroughbred hoss,” says he; “sech nostrils, and sech a gray\neye with the devil in it fer go--yellow ha’r, and ez tall ez Mr. Jackson\nheah.”\n\n“And you say he’s gone off again with Sevier?”\n\n“They rud into town” (he lowered his voice, for the room was filling),\n“snapped their fingers at Tipton and his warrant, and rud out ag’in. My\nGod, but that was like Nollichucky Jack. Say, stranger, when your Mr.\nTemple smiled--”\n\n“He is the man!” I cried; “tell me where to find him.”\n\nMr. Jackson, who had been divided between astonishment and impatience\nand anger, burst out again.\n\n“What the devil do you mean by interfering with my business, sir?”\n\n“Because it is my business too,” I answered, quite as testily; “my claim\non Mr. Temple is greater than yours.”\n\n“By Jehovah!” cried Jackson, “come outside, sir, come outside!”\n\nThe landlord backed away, and the men in the tavern began to press\naround us expectantly.\n\n“Gallop into him, Andy!” cried one.\n\n“Don’t let him git near no fences, stranger,” said another.\n\nMr. Jackson turned on this man with such truculence that he edged away\nto the rear of the room.\n\n“Step out, sir,” said Mr. Jackson, starting for the door before I could\nreply. I followed perforce, not without misgivings, the crowd pushing\neagerly after. Before we reached the dusty street Jackson began pulling\noff his coat. In a trice the shouting onlookers had made a ring, and we\nstood facing each other, he in his shirt-sleeves.\n\n“We’ll fight fair,” said he, his lips wetting.\n\n“Very good,” said I, “if you are still accustomed to this hasty manner.\nYou have not asked my name, my standing, nor my reasons for wanting Mr.\nTemple.”\n\nI know not whether it was what I said that made him stare, or how I said\nit.\n\n“Pistols, if you like,” said he.\n\n“No,” said I; “I am in a hurry to find Mr. Temple. I fought you this way\nonce, and it’s quicker.”\n\n“You fought me this way once?” he repeated. The noise of the crowd was\nhushed, and they drew nearer to hear.\n\n“Come, Mr. Jackson,” said I, “you are a lawyer and a gentleman, and so\nam I. I do not care to be beaten to a pulp, but I am not afraid of\nyou. And I am in a hurry. If you will step back into the tavern, I will\nexplain to you my reasons for wishing to get to Mr. Temple.”\n\nMr. Jackson stared at me the more.\n\n“By the eternal,” said he, “you are a cool man. Give me my coat,” he\nshouted to the bystanders, and they helped him on with it. “Now,”\n said he, as they made to follow him, “keep back. I would talk to this\ngentleman. By the heavens,” he cried, when he had gained the room, “I\nbelieve you are not afraid of me. I saw it in your eyes.”\n\nThen I laughed.\n\n“Mr. Jackson,” said I, “doubtless you do not remember a homeless boy\nnamed David whom you took to your uncle’s house in the Waxhaws--”\n\n“I do,” he exclaimed, “as I live I do. Why, we slept together.”\n\n“And you stumped your toe getting into bed and swore,” said I.\n\nAt that he laughed so heartily that the landlord came running across the\nroom.\n\n“And we fought together at the Old Fields School. Are you that boy?”\nand he scanned me again. “By God, I believe you are.” Suddenly his face\nclouded once more. “But what about Temple?” said he.\n\n“Ah,” I answered, “I come to that quickly. Mr. Temple is my cousin.\nAfter I left your uncle’s house my father took me to Charlestown.”\n\n“Is he a Charlestown Temple?” demanded Mr. Jackson. “For I spent some\ntime gambling and horse-racing with the gentry there, and I know many of\nthem. I was a wild lad” (I repeat his exact words), “and I ran up a bill\nin Charlestown that would have filled a folio volume. Faith, all I had\nleft me was the clothes on my back and a good horse. I made up my mind\none night that if I could pay my debts and get out of Charlestown I\nwould go into the back country and study law and sober down. There was\na Mr. Braiden in the ordinary who staked me two hundred dollars at\nrattle-and-snap against my horse. Gad, sir, that was providence. I\nwon. I left Charlestown with honor, I studied law at Salisbury in North\nCarolina, and I have come here to practise it.”\n\n“You seem to have the talent,” said I, smiling at the remembrance of the\nHump Gibson incident.\n\n“That is my history in a nutshell,” said Mr. Jackson. “And now,” he\nadded, “since you are Mr. Temple’s cousin and friend and an old\nacquaintance of mine to boot, I will tell you where I think he is.”\n\n“Where is that?” I asked eagerly.\n\n“I’ll stake a cowbell that Sevier will stop at the Widow Brown’s,” he\nreplied. “I’ll put you on the road. But mind you, you are to tell Mr.\nTemple that he is to come back here and race me at Greasy Cove.”\n\n“I’ll warrant him to come,” said I.\n\nWhereupon we left the inn together, more amicably than before. Mr.\nJackson had a thoroughbred horse near by that was a pleasure to see, and\nmy admiration of his mount seemed to set me as firmly in Mr. Jackson’s\nesteem again as that gentleman himself sat in the saddle. He was as good\nas his word, rode out with me some distance on the road, and reminded me\nat the last that Nick was to race him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE WIDOW BROWN’S\n\n\nIt was not to my credit that I should have lost the trail, after Mr.\nJackson put me straight. But the night was dark, the country unknown to\nme, and heavily wooded and mountainous. In addition to these things\nmy mind ran like fire. My thoughts sometimes flew back to the wondrous\nsummer evening when I trod the Nollichucky trace with Tom and Polly\nAnn, when I first looked down upon the log palace of that prince of the\nborder, John Sevier. Well I remembered him, broad-shouldered, handsome,\ngay, a courtier in buckskin. Small wonder he was idolized by the Watauga\nsettlers, that he had been their leader in the struggle of Franklin for\nliberty. And small wonder that Nick Temple should be in his following.\n\nNick! My mind was in a torment concerning him. What of his mother?\nShould I speak of having seen her? I went blindly through the woods\nfor hours after the night fell, my horse stumbling and weary, until at\nlength I came to a lonely clearing on the mountain side, and a fierce\npack of dogs dashed barking at my horse’s heels. There was a dark cabin\nahead, indistinct in the starlight, and there I knocked until a gruff\nvoice answered me and a tousled man came to the door. Yes, I had missed\nthe trail. He shook his head when I asked for the Widow Brown’s, and\nbade me share his bed for the night. No, I would go on, I was used\nto the backwoods. Thereupon he thawed a little, kicked the dogs, and\npointed to where the mountain dipped against the star-studded sky. There\nwas a trail there which led direct to the Widow Brown’s, if I could\nfollow it. So I left him.\n\nOnce the fear had settled deeply of missing Nick at the Widow Brown’s, I\nput my mind on my journey, and thanks to my early training I was able\nto keep the trail. It doubled around the spurs, forded stony brooks in\ndiagonals, and often in the darkness of the mountain forest I had to\nfeel for the blazes on the trees. There was no making time. I gained the\nnotch with the small hours of the morning, started on with the descent,\ncrisscrossing, following a stream here and a stream there, until at\nlength the song of the higher waters ceased and I knew that I was in the\nvalley. Suddenly there was no crown-cover over my head. I had gained the\nroad once more, and I followed it hopefully, avoiding the stumps and the\ndeep wagon ruts where the ground was spongy.\n\nThe morning light revealed a milky mist through which the trees showed\nlike phantoms. Then there came stains upon the mist of royal purple,\nof scarlet, of yellow like a mandarin’s robe, peeps of deep blue fading\ninto azure as the mist lifted. The fiery eye of the sun was cocked over\nthe crest, and beyond me I saw a house with its logs all golden brown\nin the level rays, the withered cornstalks orange among the blackened\nstumps. My horse stopped of his own will at the edge of the clearing. A\ncock crew, a lean hound prostrate on the porch of the house rose to his\nhaunches, sniffed, growled, leaped down, and ran to the road and sniffed\nagain. I listened, startled, and made sure of the distant ring of many\nhoofs. And yet I stayed there, irresolute. Could it be Tipton and his\nmen riding from Jonesboro to capture Sevier? The hoof-beats grew louder,\nand then the hound in the road gave tongue to the short, sharp bark that\nis the call to arms. Other dogs, hitherto unseen, took up the cry, and\nturning in my saddle I saw a body of men riding hard at me through the\nalley in the forest. At their head, on a heavy, strong-legged horse,\nwas one who might have stood for the figure of turbulence, and I made\nno doubt that this was Colonel Tipton himself,--Colonel Tipton, once\nsecessionist, now champion of the Old North State and arch-enemy of John\nSevier. At sight of me he reined up so violently that his horse went\nback on his haunches, and the men behind were near overriding him.\n\n“Look out, boys,” he shouted, with a fierce oath, “they’ve got guards\nout!” He flung back one hand to his holster for a pistol, while the\nother reached for the powder flask at his belt. He primed the pan, and,\nseeing me immovable, set his horse forward at an amble, his pistol at\nthe cock.\n\n“Who in hell are you?” he cried.\n\n“A traveller from Virginia,” I answered.\n\n“And what are you doing here?” he demanded, with another oath.\n\n“I have just this moment come here,” said I, as calmly as I might. “I\nlost the trail in the darkness.”\n\nHe glared at me, purpling, perplexed.\n\n“Is Sevier there?” said he, pointing at the house.\n\n“I don’t know,” said I.\n\nTipton turned to his men, who were listening.\n\n“Surround the house,” he cried, “and watch this fellow.”\n\nI rode on perforce towards the house with Tipton and three others, while\nhis men scattered over the corn-field and cursed the dogs. And then we\nsaw in the open door the figure of a woman shading her eyes with her\nhand. We pulled up, five of us, before the porch in front of her.\n\n“Good morning, Mrs. Brown,” said Tipton, gruffly.\n\n“Good morning, Colonel,” answered the widow.\n\nTipton leaped from his horse, flung the bridle to a companion, and\nput his foot on the edge of the porch to mount. Then a strange thing\nhappened. The lady turned deftly, seized a chair from within, and pulled\nit across the threshold. She sat herself down firmly, an expression\non her face which hinted that the late lamented Mr. Brown had been a\ndominated man. Colonel Tipton stopped, staggering from the very impetus\nof his charge, and gazed at her blankly.\n\n“I have come for Colonel Sevier,” he blurted. And then, his anger\nrising, “I will have no trifling, ma’am. He is in this house.”\n\n“La! you don’t tell me,” answered the widow, in a tone that was wholly\nconversational.\n\n“He is in this house,” shouted the Colonel.\n\n“I reckon you’ve guessed wrong, Colonel,” said the widow.\n\nThere was an awkward pause until Tipton heard a titter behind him. Then\nhis wrath exploded.\n\n“I have a warrant against the scoundrel for high treason,” he cried,\n“and, by God, I will search the house and serve it.”\n\nStill the widow sat tight. The Rock of Ages was neither more movable nor\ncalmer than she.\n\n“Surely, Colonel, you would not invade the house of an unprotected\nfemale.”\n\nThe Colonel, evidently with a great effort, throttled his wrath for the\nmoment. His new tone was apologetic but firm.\n\n“I regret to have to do so, ma’am,” said he, “but both sexes are equal\nbefore the law.”\n\n“The law!” repeated the widow, seemingly tickled at the word. She smiled\nindulgently at the Colonel. “What a pity, Mr. Tipton, that the law\ncompels you to arrest such a good friend of yours as Colonel Sevier.\nWhat self-sacrifice, Colonel Tipton! What nobility!”\n\nThere was a second titter behind him, whereat he swung round quickly,\nand the crimson veins in his face looked as if they must burst. He saw\nme with my hand over my mouth.\n\n“You warned him, damn you!” he shouted, and turning again leaped to the\nporch and tried to squeeze past the widow into the house.\n\n“How dare you, sir?” she shrieked, giving him a vigorous push backwards.\nThe four of us, his three men and myself, laughed outright. Tipton’s\nrage leaped its bounds. He returned to the attack again and again, and\nyet at the crucial moment his courage would fail him and he would let\nthe widow thrust him back. Suddenly I became aware that there were two\nnew spectators of this comedy. I started and looked again, and was\nnear to crying out at sight of one of them. The others did cry out, but\nTipton paid no heed.\n\nTen years had made his figure more portly, but I knew at once the man\nin the well-fitting hunting shirt, with the long hair flowing to his\nshoulders, with the keen, dark face and courtly bearing and humorous\neyes. Yes, humorous even now, for he stood, smiling at this comedy\nplayed by his enemy, unmindful of his peril. The widow saw him before\nTipton did, so intent was he on the struggle.\n\n“Enough!” she cried, “enough, John Tipton!” Tipton drew back\ninvoluntarily, and a smile broadened on the widow’s face. “Shame on you\nfor doubting a lady’s word! Allow me to present to you--Colonel Sevier.”\n\nTipton turned, stared as a man might who sees a ghost, and broke into\nsuch profanity as I have seldom heard.\n\n“By the eternal God, John Sevier,” he shouted, “I’ll hang you to the\nnearest tree!”\n\nColonel Sevier merely made a little ironical bow and looked at the\ngentleman beside him.\n\n“I have surrendered to Colonel Love,” he said.\n\nTipton snatched from his belt the pistol which he might have used on me,\nand there flashed through my head the thought that some powder might\nyet be held in its pan. We cried out, all of us, his men, the widow, and\nmyself,--all save Sevier, who stood quietly, smiling. Suddenly, while\nwe waited for murder, a tall figure shot out of the door past the\nwidow, the pistol flew out of Tipton’s hand, and Tipton swung about with\nsomething like a bellow, to face Mr. Nicholas Temple.\n\nWell I knew him! And oddly enough at that time Riddle’s words of long\nago came to me, “God help the woman you love or the man you fight.” How\nshall I describe him? He was thin even to seeming frailness,--yet it\nwas the frailness of the race-horse. The golden hair, sun-tanned, awry\nacross his forehead, the face the same thin and finely cut face of the\nboy. The gray eyes held an anger that did not blaze; it was far more\ndangerous than that. Colonel John Tipton looked, and as I live he\nrecoiled.\n\n“If you touch him, I’ll kill you,” said Mr. Temple. Nor did he say it\nangrily. I marked for the first time that he held a pistol in his slim\nfingers. What Tipton might have done when he swung to his new bearings\nis mere conjecture, for Colonel Sevier himself stepped up on the porch,\nlaid his hand on Temple’s arm, and spoke to him in a low tone. What he\nsaid we didn’t hear. The astonishing thing was that neither of them for\nthe moment paid any attention to the infuriated man beside them. I\nsaw Nick’s expression change. He smiled,--the smile the landlord had\ndescribed, the smile that made men and women willing to die for him.\nAfter that Colonel Sevier stooped down and picked up the pistol from\nthe floor of the porch and handed it with a bow to Tipton, butt first.\nTipton took it, seemingly without knowing why, and at that instant a\nnegro boy came around the house, leading a horse. Sevier mounted it\nwithout a protest from any one.\n\n“I am ready to go with you, gentlemen,” he said.\n\nColonel Tipton slipped his pistol back into his belt, stepped down from\nthe porch, and leaped into his saddle, and he and his men rode off into\nthe stump-lined alley in the forest that was called a road. Nick stood\nbeside the widow, staring after them until they had disappeared.\n\n“My horse, boy!” he shouted to the gaping negro, who vanished on the\nerrand.\n\n“What will you do, Mr. Temple?” asked the widow.\n\n“Rescue him, ma’am,” cried Nick, beginning to pace up and down. “I’ll\nride to Turner’s. Cozby and Evans are there, and before night we shall\nhave made Jonesboro too hot to hold Tipton and his cutthroats.”\n\n“La, Mr. Temple,” said the widow, with unfeigned admiration, “I never\nsaw the like of you. But I know John Tipton, and he’ll have Colonel\nSevier started for North Carolina before our boys can get to Jonesboro.”\n\n“Then we’ll follow,” says Nick, beginning to pace again. Suddenly, at a\ncry from the widow, he stopped and stared at me, a light in his eye like\na point of steel. His hand slipped to his waist.\n\n“A spy,” he said, and turned and smiled at the lady, who was watching\nhim with a kind of fascination; “but damnably cool,” he continued,\nlooking at me. “I wonder if he thinks to outride me on that beast? Look\nyou, sir,” he cried, as Mrs. Brown’s negro came back struggling with a\ndeep-ribbed, high-crested chestnut that was making half circles on\nhis hind legs, “I’ll give you to the edge of the woods, and lay you\na six-forty against a pair of moccasins that you never get back to\nTipton.”\n\n“God forbid that I ever do,” I answered fervently.\n\n“What,” he exclaimed, “and you here with him on this sneak’s errand!”\n\n“I am here with him on no errand,” said I. “He and his crew came on me\na quarter of an hour since at the edge of the clearing. Mr. Temple, I am\nhere to find you, and to save time I will ride with you.”\n\n“Egad, you’ll have to ride like the devil then,” said he, and he stooped\nand snatched the widow’s hand and kissed it with a daring gallantry that\nI had thought to find in him. He raised his eyes to hers.\n\n“Good-by, Mr. Temple,” she said,--there was a tremor in her voice,--“and\nmay you save our Jack!”\n\nHe snatched the bridle from the boy, and with one leap he was on the\nrearing, wheeling horse. “Come on,” he cried to me, and, waving his hat\nat the lady on the porch, he started off with a gallop up the trail in\nthe opposite direction from that which Tipton’s men had taken.\n\nAll that I saw of Mr. Nicholas Temple on that ride to Turner’s was\nhis back, and presently I lost sight of that. In truth, I never got to\nTurner’s at all, for I met him coming back at the wind’s pace, a huge,\nswarthy, determined man at his side and four others spurring after, the\nspume dripping from the horses’ mouths. They did not so much as look at\nme as they passed, and there was nothing left for me to do but to turn\nmy tired beast and follow at any pace I could make towards Jonesboro.\n\nIt was late in the afternoon before I reached the town, the town set\ndown among the hills like a caldron boiling over with the wrath of\nFranklin. The news of the capture of their beloved Sevier had flown\nthrough the mountains like seeds on the autumn wind, and from north,\nsouth, east, and west the faithful were coming in, cursing Tipton and\nCarolina as they rode.\n\nI tethered my tired beast at the first picket, and was no sooner on my\nfeet than I was caught in the hurrying stream of the crowd and fairly\npushed and beaten towards the court-house. Around it a thousand furious\nmen were packed. I heard cheering, hoarse and fierce cries, threats\nand imprecations, and I knew that they were listening to oratory. I was\nsuddenly shot around the corner of a house, saw the orator himself, and\ngasped.\n\nIt was Nicholas Temple. There was something awe-impelling in the tall,\nslim, boyish figure that towered above the crowd, in the finely wrought,\npassionate face, in the voice charged with such an anger as is given to\nfew men.\n\n“What has North Carolina done for Franklin?” he cried. “Protected her?\nNo. Repudiated her? Yes. You gave her to the Confederacy for a war\ndebt, and the Confederacy flung her back. You shook yourselves free from\nCarolina’s tyranny, and traitors betrayed you again. And now they have\nbetrayed your leader. Will you avenge him, or will you sit down like\ncowards while they hang him for treason?”\n\nHis voice was drowned, but he stood immovable with arms folded until\nthere was silence again.\n\n“Will you rescue him?” he cried, and the roar rose again. “Will you\navenge him? By to-morrow we shall have two thousand here. Invade North\nCarolina, humble her, bring her to her knees, and avenge John Sevier!”\n\nPandemonium reigned. Hats were flung in the air, rifles fired, shouts\nand curses rose and blended into one terrifying note. Gradually, in the\nmidst of this mad uproar, the crowd became aware that another man\nwas standing upon the stump from which Nicholas Temple had leaped.\n“Cozby!” some one yelled, “Cozby!” The cry was taken up. “Huzzay for\nCozby! He’ll lead us into Caroliny.” He was the huge, swarthy man I had\nseen riding hard with Nick that morning. A sculptor might have chosen\nhis face and frame for a type of the iron-handed leader of pioneers.\nWill was supreme in the great features,--inflexible, indomitable will.\nHis hunting shirt was open across his great chest, his black hair\nfell to his shoulders, and he stood with a compelling hand raised for\nsilence. And when he spoke, slowly, resonantly, men fell back before his\nwords.\n\n“I admire Mr. Temple’s courage, and above all his loyalty to our beloved\nGeneral,” said Major Cozby. “But Mr. Temple is young, and the heated\ncounsels of youth must not prevail. My friends, in order to save Jack\nSevier we must be moderate.”\n\nHis voice, strong as it was, was lost. “To hell with moderation!” they\nshouted. “Down with North Carolina! We’ll fight her!”\n\nHe got silence again by the magnetic strength he had in him.\n\n“Very good,” he said, “but get your General first. If we lead you across\nthe mountains now, his blood will be upon your heads. No man is a better\nfriend to Jack Sevier than I. Leave his rescue to me, and I will get him\nfor you.” He paused, and they were stilled perforce. “I will get him for\nyou,” he repeated slowly, “or North Carolina will pay for the burial of\nJames Cozby.”\n\nThere was an instant when they might have swung either way.\n\n“How will ye do it?” came in a thin, piping voice from somewhere near\nthe stump. It may have been this that turned their minds. Others took up\nthe question, “How will ye do it, Major Cozby?”\n\n“I don’t know,” cried the Major, “I don’t know. And if I did know, I\nwouldn’t tell you. But I will get Nollichucky Jack if I have to burn\nMorganton and rake the General out of the cinders!”\n\nFive hundred hands flew up, five hundred voices cried, “I’m with ye,\nMajor Cozby!” But the Major only shook his head and smiled. What he said\nwas lost in the roar. Fighting my way forward, I saw him get down from\nthe stump, put his hand kindly on Nick’s shoulder, and lead him into the\ncourt-house. They were followed by a score of others, and the door was\nshut behind them.\n\nIt was then I bethought myself of the letter to Mr. Wright, and I sought\nfor some one who would listen to my questions as to his whereabouts.\nAt length the man himself was pointed out to me, haranguing an excited\ncrowd of partisans in front of his own gate. Some twenty minutes must\nhave passed before I could get any word with him. He was a vigorous\nlittle man, with black eyes like buttons, he wore brown homespun and\nwhite stockings, and his hair was clubbed. When he had yielded the\nground to another orator, I handed him the letter. He drew me aside,\nread it on the spot, and became all hospitality at once. The town was\nfull, and though he had several friends staying in his house I should\njoin them. Was my horse fed? Dinner had been forgotten that day, but\nwould I enter and partake? In short, I found myself suddenly provided\nfor, and I lost no time in getting my weary mount into Mr. Wright’s\nlittle stable. And then I sat down, with several other gentlemen, at Mr.\nWright’s board, where there was much guessing as to Major Cozby’s plan.\n\n“No other man west of the mountains could have calmed that crowd after\nthat young daredevil Temple had stirred them up,” declared Mr. Wright.\n\nI ventured to say that I had business with Mr. Temple.\n\n“Faith, then, I will invite him here,” said my host. “But I warn you,\nMr. Ritchie, that he is a trigger set on the hair. If he does not fancy\nyou, he may quarrel with you and shoot you. And he is in no temper to\nbectrifled with to-day.”\n\n“I am not an easy person to quarrel with,” I answered.\n\n“To look at you, I shouldn’t say that you were,” said he. “We are going\nto the court-house, and I will see if I can get a word with the young\nHotspur and send him to you. Do you wait here.”\n\nI waited on the porch as the day waned. The tumult of the place had died\ndown, for men were gathering in the houses to discuss and conjecture.\nAnd presently, sauntering along the street in a careless fashion, his\nspurs trailing in the dust, came Nicholas Temple. He stopped before the\nhouse and stared at me with a fine insolence, and I wondered whether I\nmyself had not been too hasty in reclaiming him. A greeting died on my\nlips.\n\n“Well, sir” he said, “so you are the gentleman who has been dogging me\nall day.”\n\n“I dog no one, Mr. Temple,” I replied bitterly.\n\n“We’ll not quibble about words,” said he. “Would it be impertinent to\nask your business--and perhaps your name?”\n\n“Did not Mr. Wright give you my name?” I exclaimed.\n\n“He might have mentioned it, I did not hear. Is it of such importance?”\n\nAt that I lost my temper entirely.\n\n“It may be, and it may not,” I retorted. “I am David Ritchie.”\n\nHe changed before my eyes as he stared at me, and then, ere I knew it,\nhe had me by both arms, crying out:--\n\n“David Ritchie! My Davy--who ran away from me--and we were going to\nKentucky together. Oh, I have never forgiven you,”--the smile that there\nwas no resisting belied his words as he put his face close to mine--“I\nnever will forgive you. I might have known you--you’ve grown, but I vow\nyou’re still an old man,--Davy, you renegade. And where the devil did\nyou run to?”\n\n“Kentucky,” I said, laughing.\n\n“Oh, you traitor--and I trusted you. I loved you, Davy. Do you remember\nhow I clung to you in my sleep? And when I woke up, the world was black.\nI followed your trail down the drive and to the cross-roads--”\n\n“It was not ingratitude, Nick,” I said; “you were all I had in the\nworld.” And then I faltered, the sadness of that far-off time coming\nover me in a flood, and the remembrance of his generous sorrow for me.\n\n“And how the devil did you track me to the Widow Brown’s?” he demanded,\nreleasing me.\n\n“A Mr. Jackson had a shrewd notion you were there. And by the way, he\nwas in a fine temper because you had skipped a race with him.”\n\n“That sorrel-topped, lantern-headed Mr. Jackson?” said Nick. “He’ll be\nkilled in one of his fine tempers. Damn a man who can’t keep his temper.\nI’ll race him, of course. And where are you bound now, Davy?”\n\n“For Louisville, in Kentucky, at the Falls of the Ohio. It is a growing\nplace, and a promising one for a young man in the legal profession to\nbegin life.”\n\n“When do you leave?” said he.\n\n“To-morrow morning, Nick,” said I. “You wanted once to go to Kentucky;\nwhy not come with me?”\n\nHis face clouded.\n\n“I do not budge from this town,” said he, “I do not budge until I hear\nthat Jack Sevier is safe. Damn Cozby! If he had given me my way, we\nshould have been forty miles from here by this. I’ll tell you. Cozby is\neven now picking five men to go to Morganton and steal Sevier, and he\nputs me off with a kind word. He’ll not have me, he says.”\n\n“He thinks you too hot. It needs discretion and an old head,” said I.\n\n“Egad, then, I’ll commend you to him,” said Nick.\n\n“Now,” I said, “it’s time for you to tell me something of yourself, and\nhow you chanced to come into this country.”\n\n“‘Twas Darnley’s fault,” said Nick.\n\n“Darnley!” I exclaimed; “he whom you got into the duel with--” I stopped\nabruptly, with a sharp twinge of remembrance that was like a pain in my\nside. ‘Twas Nick took up the name.\n\n“With Harry Riddle.” He spoke quietly, that was the terrifying part of\nit. “David, I’ve looked for that man in Italy and France, I’ve scoured\nLondon for him, and, by God, I’ll find him before he dies. And when I do\nfind him I swear to you that there will be no such thing as time wasted,\nor mercy.”\n\nI shuddered. In all my life I had never known such a moment of\nindecision. Should I tell him? My conscience would give me no definite\nreply. The question had haunted me all the night, and I had lost my\nway in consequence, nor had the morning’s ride from the Widow Brown’s\nsufficed to bring me to a decision. Of what use to tell him? Would\nRiddle’s death mend matters? The woman loved him, that had been clear to\nme; yet, by telling Nick what I knew I might induce him to desist from\nhis search, and if I did not tell, Nick might some day run across the\ntrail, follow it up, take Riddle’s life, and lose his own. The moment,\nmade for confession as it was, passed.\n\n“They have ruined my life,” said Nick. “I curse him, and I curse her.”\n\n“Hold!” I cried; “she is your mother.”\n\n“And therefore I curse her the more,” he said. “You know what she is,\nyou’ve tasted of her charity, and you are my father’s nephew. If you\nhave been without experience, I will tell you what she is. A common--”\n\nI reached out and put my hand across his mouth.\n\n“Silence!” I cried; “you shall say no such thing. And have you not\nmanhood enough to make your own life for yourself?”\n\n“Manhood!” he repeated, and laughed. It was a laugh that I did not like.\n“They made a man of me, my parents. My father played false with the\nRebels and fled to England for his reward. A year after he went I was\nleft alone at Temple Bow to the tender mercies of the niggers. Mr. Mason\ncame back and snatched what was left of me. He was a good man; he saved\nme an annuity out of the estate, he took me abroad after the war on\na grand tour, and died of a fever in Rome. I made my way back to\nCharlestown, and there I learned to gamble, to hold liquor like a\ngentleman, to run horses and fight like a gentleman. We were speaking of\nDarnley,” he said.\n\n“Yes, of Darnley,” I repeated.\n\n“The devil of a man,” said Nick; “do you remember him, with the cracked\nvoice and fat calves?”\n\nAt any other time I should have laughed at the recollection.\n\n“Darnley turned Whig, became a Continental colonel, and got a grant out\nhere in the Cumberland country of three thousand acres. And now I own\nit.”\n\n“You own it!” I exclaimed.\n\n“Rattle-and-snap,” said Nick; “I played him for the land at the ordinary\none night, and won it. It is out here near a place called Nashboro,\nwhere this wild, long-faced Mr. Jackson says he is going soon. I crossed\nthe mountains to have a look at it, fell in with Nollichucky Jack, and\nwent off with him for a summer campaign. There’s a man for you, Davy,”\n he cried, “a man to follow through hell-fire. If they touch a hair of\nhis head we’ll sack the State of North Carolina from Morganton to the\nsea.”\n\n“But the land?” I asked.\n\n“Oh, a fig for the land,” answered Nick; “as soon as Nollichucky Jack is\nsafe I’ll follow you into Kentucky.” He slapped me on the knee. “Egad,\nDavy, it seems like a fairy tale. We always said we were going to\nKentucky, didn’t we? What is the name of the place you are to startle\nwith your learning and calm by your example?”\n\n“Louisville,” I answered, laughing, “by the Falls of the Ohio.”\n\n“I shall turn up there when Jack Sevier is safe and I have won some more\nland from Mr. Jackson. We’ll have a rare old time together, though I\nhave no doubt you can drink me under the table. Beware of these sober\nmen. Egad, Davy, you need only a woolsack to become a full-fledged\njudge. And now tell me how fortune has buffeted you.”\n\nIt was my second night without sleep, for we sat burning candles in Mr.\nWright’s house until the dawn, making up the time which we had lost away\nfrom each other.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. I MEET A HERO\n\nWhen left to myself, I was wont to slide into the commonplace; and where\nmy own dull life intrudes to clog the action I cut it down here and\npare it away there until I am merely explanatory, and not too much\nin evidence. I rode out the Wilderness Trail, fell in with other\ntravellers, was welcomed by certain old familiar faces at Harrodstown,\nand pressed on. I have a vivid recollection of a beloved, vigorous\nfigure swooping out of a cabin door and scattering a brood of children\nright and left. “Polly Ann!” I said, and she halted, trembling.\n\n“Tom,” she cried, “Tom, it’s Davy come back;” and Tom himself flew out\nof the door, ramrod in one hand and rifle in the other. Never shall I\nforget them as they stood there, he grinning with sheer joy as of yore,\nand she, with her hair flying and her blue gown snapping in the wind,\nin a tremor between tears and laughter. I leaped to the ground, and\nshe hugged me in her arms as though I had been a child, calling my name\nagain and again, and little Tom pulling at the skirts of my coat. I\ncaught the youngster by the collar.\n\n“Polly Ann,” said I, “he’s grown to what I was when you picked me up, a\nfoundling.”\n\n“And now it’s little Davy no more,” she answered, swept me a courtesy,\nand added, with a little quiver in her voice, “ye are a gentleman now.”\n\n“My heart is still where it was,” said I.\n\n“Ay, ay,” said Tom, “I’m sure o’ that, Davy.”\n\nI was with them a fortnight in the familiar cabin, and then I took up\nmy journey northward, heavy at leaving again, but promising to see\nthem from time to time. For Tom was often at the Falls when he went\na-scouting into the Illinois country. It was, as of old, Polly Ann who\nran the mill and was the real bread-winner of the family.\n\nLouisville was even then bursting with importance, and as I rode into\nit, one bright November day, I remembered the wilderness I had seen\nhere not ten years gone when I had marched hither with Captain Harrod’s\ncompany to join Clark on the island. It was even then a thriving little\ntown of log and clapboard houses and schools and churches, and wise men\nwere saying of it--what Colonel Clark had long ago predicted--that it\nwould become the first city of commercial importance in the district of\nKentucky.\n\nI do not mean to give you an account of my struggles that winter\nto obtain a foothold in the law. The time was a heyday for young\nbarristers, and troubles in those early days grew as plentifully in\nKentucky as corn. In short, I got a practice, for Colonel Clark was\nhere to help me, and, thanks to the men who had gone to Kaskaskia and\nVincennes, I had a fairly large acquaintance in Kentucky. I hired rooms\nbehind Mr. Crede’s store, which was famed for the glass windows which\nhad been fetched all the way from Philadelphia. Mr. Crede was the\nembodiment of the enterprising spirit of the place, and often of an\nevening he called me in to see the new fashionable things his barges had\nbrought down the Ohio. The next day certain young sparks would drop into\nmy room to waylay the belles as they came to pick a costume to be worn\nat Mr. Nickle’s dancing school, or at the ball at Fort Finney.\n\nThe winter slipped away, and one cool evening in May there came a negro\nto my room with a note from Colonel Clark, bidding me sup with him at\nthe tavern and meet a celebrity.\n\nI put on my best blue clothes that I had brought with me from Richmond,\nand repaired expectantly to the tavern about eight of the clock, pushed\nthrough the curious crowd outside, and entered the big room where\nthe company was fast assembling. Against the red blaze in the great\nchimney-place I spied the figure of Colonel Clark, more portly than\nof yore, and beside him stood a gentleman who could be no other than\nGeneral Wilkinson.\n\nHe was a man to fill the eye, handsome of face, symmetrical of figure,\neasy of manner, and he wore a suit of bottle-green that became him\nadmirably. In short, so fascinated and absorbed was I in watching him as\nhe greeted this man and the other that I started as though something had\npricked me when I heard my name called by Colonel Clark.\n\n“Come here, Davy,” he cried across the room, and I came and stood\nabashed before the hero. “General, allow me to present to you the\ndrummer boy of Kaskaskia and Vincennes, Mr. David Ritchie.”\n\n“I hear that you drummed them to victory through a very hell of torture,\nMr. Ritchie,” said the General. “It is an honor to grasp the hand of one\nwho did such service at such a tender age.”\n\nGeneral Wilkinson availed himself of that honor, and encompassed me with\na smile so benignant, so winning in its candor, that I could only mutter\nmy acknowledgment, and Colonel Clark must needs apologize, laughing, for\nmy youth and timidity.\n\n“Mr. Ritchie is not good at speeches, General,” said he, “but I make\nno doubt he will drink a bumper to your health before we sit down.\nGentlemen,” he cried, filling his glass from a bottle on the table, “a\ntoast to General Wilkinson, emancipator and saviour of Kentucky!”\n\nThe company responded with a shout, tossed off the toast, and sat\ndown at the long table. Chance placed me between a young dandy from\nLexington--one of several the General had brought in his train--and\nMr. Wharton, a prominent planter of the neighborhood with whom I had\na speaking acquaintance. This was a backwoods feast, though served in\nsomething better than the old backwoods style, and we had venison and\nbear’s meat and prairie fowl as well as pork and beef, and breads that\ncame stinging hot from the Dutch ovens. Toasts to this and that were\nflung back and forth, and jests and gibes, and the butt of many of these\nwas that poor Federal government which (as one gentleman avowed) was\nlike a bantam hen trying to cover a nestful of turkey’s eggs, and\nclucking with importance all the time. This picture brought on gusts of\nlaughter.\n\n“And what say you of the Jay?” cried one; “what will he hatch?”\n\nHisses greeted the name, for Mr. Jay wished to enter into a treaty with\nSpain, agreeing to close the river for five and twenty years. Colonel\nClark stood up, and rapped on the table.\n\n“Gentlemen,” said he, “Louisville has as her guest of honor to-night a\nman of whom Kentucky may well be proud [loud cheering]. Five years ago\nhe favored Lexington by making it his home, and he came to us with the\nlaurel of former achievements still clinging to his brow. He fought and\nsuffered for his country, and attained the honorable rank of Major in\nthe Continental line. He was chosen by the people of Pennsylvania to\nrepresent them in the august body of their legislature, and now he has\ngot new honor in a new field [renewed cheering]. He has come to Kentucky\nto show her the way to prosperity and glory. Kentucky had a grievance\n[loud cries of ‘Yes, yes!’]. Her hogs and cattle had no market, her\ntobacco and agricultural products of all kinds were rotting because the\nSpaniards had closed the Mississippi to our traffic. Could the Federal\ngovernment open the river? [shouts of ‘No, no!’ and hisses]. Who\nopened it? [cries of ‘Wilkinson, Wilkinson!’]. He said to the Kentucky\nplanters, ‘Give your tobacco to me, and I will sell it.’ He put it\nin barges, he floated down the river, and, as became a man of such\ndistinction, he was met by Governor-general Miro on the levee at New\nOrleans. Where is that tobacco now, gentlemen?” Colonel Clark was here\ninterrupted by such roars and stamping that he paused a moment, and\nduring this interval Mr. Wharton leaned over and whispered quietly in my\near:--\n\n“Ay, where is it?”\n\nI stared at Mr. Wharton blankly. He was a man nearing the middle\nage, with a lacing of red in his cheeks, a pleasant gray eye, and a\nsingularly quiet manner.\n\n“Thanks to the genius of General Wilkinson,” Colonel Clark continued,\nwaving his hand towards the smilingly placid hero, “that tobacco has\nbeen deposited in the King’s store at ten dollars per hundred,--a\nprivilege heretofore confined to Spanish subjects. Well might Wilkinson\nreturn from New Orleans in a chariot and four to a grateful Kentucky!\nThis year we have tripled, nay, quadrupled, our crop of tobacco, and\nwe are here to-night to give thanks to the author of this prosperity.”\n Alas, Colonel Clark’s hand was not as steady as of yore, and he spilled\nthe liquor on the table as he raised his glass. “Gentlemen, a health to\nour benefactor.”\n\nThey drank it willingly, and withal so lengthily and noisily that Mr.\nWilkinson stood smiling and bowing for full three minutes before he\ncould be heard. He was a very paragon of modesty, was the General, and\na man whose attitudes and expressions spoke as eloquently as his words.\nNone looked at him now but knew before he opened his mouth that he was\ndeprecating such an ovation.\n\n“Gentlemen,--my friends and fellow-Kentuckians,” he said, “I thank you\nfrom the bottom of my heart for your kindness, but I assure you that I\nhave done nothing worthy of it [loud protests]. I am a simple, practical\nman, who loves Kentucky better than he loves himself. This is no virtue,\nfor we all have it. We have the misfortune to be governed by a set of\nworthy gentlemen who know little about Kentucky and her wants, and think\nless [cries of ‘Ay, ay!’]. I am not decrying General Washington and\nhis cabinet; it is but natural that the wants of the seaboard and the\nwelfare and opulence of the Eastern cities should be uppermost in their\nminds [another interruption]. Kentucky, if she would prosper, must look\nto her own welfare. And if any credit is due to me, gentlemen, it is\nbecause I reserved my decision of his Excellency, Governor-general Miro,\nand his people until I saw them for myself. A little calm reason, a\nplain statement of the case, will often remove what seems an insuperable\ndifficulty, and I assure you that Governor-general Miro is a most\nreasonable and courteous gentleman, who looks with all kindliness and\nneighborliness on the people of Kentucky. Let us drink a toast to him.\nTo him your gratitude is due, for he sends you word that your tobacco\nwill be received.”\n\n“In General Wilkinson’s barges,” said Mr. Wharton, leaning over and\nsubsiding again at once.\n\nThe General was the first to drink the toast, and he sat down very\nmodestly amidst a thunder of applause.\n\nThe young man on the other side of me, somewhat flushed, leaped to his\nfeet.\n\n“Down with the Federal government!” he cried; “what have they done for\nus, indeed? Before General Wilkinson went to New Orleans the Spaniards\nseized our flat boats and cargoes and flung our traders into prison, ay,\nand sent them to the mines of Brazil. The Federal government takes sides\nwith the Indians against us. And what has that government done for you,\nColonel?” he demanded, turning to Clark, “you who have won for them half\nof their territory? They have cast you off like an old moccasin. The\nContinental officers who fought in the East have half-pay for life or\nfive years’ full pay. And what have you?”\n\nThere was a breathless hush. A swift vision came to me of a man, young,\nalert, commanding, stern under necessity, self-repressed at all times--a\nman who by the very dominance of his character had awed into submission\nthe fierce Northern tribes of a continent, who had compelled men to\nfollow him until the life had all but ebbed from their bodies, who had\nled them to victory in the end. And I remembered a boy who had stood\nawe-struck before this man in the commandant’s house at Fort Sackville.\nAy, and I heard again his words as though he had just spoken them,\n“Promise me that you will not forget me if I am--unfortunate.” I did not\nunderstand then. And now, because of a certain blinding of my eyes, I\ndid not see him clearly as he got slowly to his feet. He clutched\nthe table. He looked around him--I dare not say--vacantly. And then,\nsuddenly, he spoke with a supreme anger and a supreme bitterness.\n\n“Not a shilling has this government given me,” he cried. “Virginia has\nmore grateful; from her I have some acres of wild land and--a sword.”\nHe laughed. “A sword, gentlemen, and not new at that. Oh, a grateful\ngovernment we serve, one careful of the honor of her captains.\nGentlemen, I stand to-day a discredited man because the honest debts I\nincurred in the service of that government are repudiated, because my\nfriends who helped it, Father Gibault, Vigo, and Gratiot, and others\nhave never been repaid. One of them is ruined.”\n\nA dozen men had sprung clamoring to their feet before he sat down. One,\nmore excited than the rest, got the ear of the company.\n\n“Do we lack leaders?” he cried. “We have them here with us to-night, in\nthis room. Who will stop us? Not the contemptible enemies in Kentucky\nwho call themselves Federalists. Shall we be supine forever? We have\nfought once for our liberties, let us fight again. Let us make a common\ncause with our real friends on the far side of the Mississippi.”\n\nI rose, sick at heart, but every man was standing. And then a strange\nthing happened. I saw General Wilkinson at the far end of the room; his\nhand was raised, and there was that on his handsome face which might\nhave been taken for a smile, and yet was not a smile. Others saw him\ntoo, I know not by what exertion of magnetism. They looked at him and\nthey held their tongues.\n\n“I fear that we are losing our heads, gentlemen,” he said; “and I\npropose to you the health of the first citizen of Kentucky, Colonel\nGeorge George Rogers Clark.”\n\nI found myself out of the tavern and alone in the cool May night. And as\nI walked slowly down the deserted street, my head in a whirl, a hand\nwas laid on my shoulder. I turned, startled, to face Mr. Wharton, the\nplanter.\n\n“I would speak a word with you, Mr. Ritchie,” he said. “May I come to\nyour room for a moment?”\n\n“Certainly, sir,” I answered.\n\nAfter that we walked along together in silence, my own mind heavily\noccupied with what I had seen and heard. We came to Mr. Crede’s store,\nwent in at the picket gate beside it and down the path to my own door,\nwhich I unlocked. I felt for the candle on the table, lighted it, and\nturned in surprise to discover that Mr. Wharton was poking up the fire\nand pitching on a log of wood. He flung off his greatcoat and sat down\nwith his feet to the blaze. I sat down beside him and waited, thinking\nhim a sufficiently peculiar man.\n\n“You are not famous, Mr. Ritchie,” said he, presently.\n\n“No, sir,” I answered.\n\n“Nor particularly handsome,” he continued, “nor conspicuous in any way.”\n\nI agreed to this, perforce.\n\n“You may thank God for it,” said Mr. Wharton.\n\n“That would be a strange outpouring, sir,” said I.\n\nHe looked at me and smiled.\n\n“What think you of this paragon, General Wilkinson?” he demanded\nsuddenly.\n\n“I have Federal leanings, sir,” I answered\n\n“Egad,” said he, “we’ll add caution to your lack of negative\naccomplishments. I have had an eye on you this winter, though you did\nnot know it. I have made inquiries about you, and hence I am not here\nto-night entirely through impulse. You have not made a fortune at the\nlaw, but you have worked hard, steered wide of sensation, kept your\nmouth shut. Is it not so?”\n\nAstonished, I merely nodded in reply.\n\n“I am not here to waste your time or steal your sleep,” he went on,\ngiving the log a push with his foot, “and I will come to the point. When\nfirst laid eyes on this fine gentleman, General Wilkinson, I too fell\na victim to his charms. It was on the eve of this epoch-making trip of\nwhich we heard so glowing an account to-night, and I made up my mind\nthat no Spaniard, however wily, could resist his persuasion. He said to\nme, ‘Wharton, give me your crop of tobacco and I promise you to sell it\nin spite of all the royal mandates that go out of Madrid.’ He went, he\nsaw, he conquered the obdurate Miro as he has apparently conquered the\nrest of the world, and he actually came back in a chariot and four as\nbefitted him. A heavy crop of tobacco was raised in Kentucky that year.\nI helped to raise it,” added Mr. Wharton, dryly. “I gave the General my\nsecond crop, and he sent it down. Mr. Ritchie, I have to this day never\nreceived a piastre for my merchandise, nor am I the only planter in this\nsituation. Yet General Wilkinson is prosperous.”\n\nMy astonishment somewhat prevented me from replying to this, too. Was it\npossible that Mr. Wharton meant to sue the General? I reflected while he\npaused. I remembered how inconspicuous he had named me, and hope died.\nMr. Wharton did not look at me, but stared into the fire, for he was\nplainly not a man to rail and rant.\n\n“Mr. Ritchie, you are young, but mark my words, that man Wilkinson will\nbring Kentucky to ruin if he is not found out. The whole district from\nCrab Orchard to Bear Grass is mad about him. Even Clark makes a fool of\nhimself--”\n\n“Colonel Clark, sir!” I cried.\n\nHe put up a hand.\n\n“So you have some hot blood,” he said. “I know you love him. So do I,\nor I should not have been there tonight. Do I blame his bitterness? Do I\nblame--anything he does? The treatment he has had would bring a blush\nof shame to the cheek of any nation save a republic. Republics are\nwasteful, sir. In George Rogers Clark they have thrown away a general\nwho might some day have decided the fate of this country, they have left\nto stagnate a man fit to lead a nation to war. And now he is ready\nto intrigue against the government with any adventurer who may have\nconvincing ways and a smooth tongue.”\n\n“Mr. Wharton,” I said, rising, “did you come here to tell me this?”\n\nBut Mr. Wharton continued to stare into the fire.\n\n“I like you the better for it, my dear sir,” said he, “and I assure\nyou that I mean no offence. Colonel Clark is enshrined in our hearts,\nDemocrats and Federalists alike. Whatever he may do, we shall love him\nalways. But this other man,--pooh!” he exclaimed, which was as near a\nvigorous expression as he got. “Now, sir, to the point. I, too, am a\nFederalist, a friend of Mr. Humphrey Marshall, and, as you know, we are\nsadly in the minority in Kentucky now. I came here to-night to ask you\nto undertake a mission in behalf of myself and certain other gentlemen,\nand I assure you that my motives are not wholly mercenary.” He paused,\nsmiled, and put the tips of his fingers together. “I would willingly\nlose every crop for the next ten years to convict this Wilkinson of\ntreason against the Federal government.”\n\n“Treason!” I repeated involuntarily.\n\n“Mr. Ritchie,” answered the planter, “I gave you credit for some\nshrewdness. Do you suppose the Federal government does not realize the\ndanger of this situation in Kentucky. They have tried in vain to open\nthe Mississippi, and are too weak to do it. This man Wilkinson goes down\nto see Miro, and Miro straightway opens the river to us through him. How\ndo you suppose Wilkinson did it? By his charming personality?”\n\nI said something, I know not what, as the light began to dawn on me. And\nthen I added, “I had not thought about the General.”\n\n“Ah,” replied Mr. Wharton, “just so. And now you may easily imagine that\nGeneral Wilkinson has come to a very pretty arrangement with Miro. For\na certain stipulated sum best known to Wilkinson and Miro, General\nWilkinson agrees gradually to detach Kentucky from the Union and join it\nto his Catholic Majesty’s dominion of Louisiana. The bribe--the opening\nof the river. What the government could not do Wilkinson did by the\nlifting of his finger.”\n\nStill Mr. Wharton spoke without heat.\n\n“Mind you,” he said, “we have no proof of this, and that is my reason\nfor coming here to-night, Mr. Ritchie. I want you to get proof of it if\nyou can.”\n\n“You want me--” I said, bewildered.\n\n“I repeat that you are not handsome,”--I think he emphasized this\nunduly,--“that you are self-effacing, inconspicuous; in short, you are\nnot a man to draw suspicion. You might travel anywhere and scarcely be\nnoticed,--I have observed that about you. In addition to this you are\nwary, you are discreet, you are painstaking. I ask you to go first to\nSt. Louis, in Louisiana territory, and this for two reasons. First,\nbecause it will draw any chance suspicion from your real objective,\nNew Orleans; and second, because it is necessary to get letters to New\nOrleans from such leading citizens of St. Louis as Colonel Chouteau and\nMonsieur Gratiot, and I will give you introductions to them. You are\nthen to take passage to New Orleans in a barge of furs which Monsieur\nGratiot is sending down. Mind, we do not expect that you will obtain\nproof that Miro is paying Wilkinson money. If you do, so much the\nbetter; but we believe that both are too sharp to leave any tracks. You\nwill make a report, however, upon the conditions under which our tobacco\nis being received, and of all other matters which you may think germane\nto the business in hand. Will you go?”\n\nI had made up my mind.\n\n“Yes, I will go,” I answered.\n\n“Good,” said Mr. Wharton, but with no more enthusiasm than he had\npreviously shown; “I thought I had not misjudged you. Is your law\nbusiness so onerous that you could not go to-morrow?”\n\nI laughed.\n\n“I think I could settle what affairs I have by noon, Mr. Wharton,” I\nreplied.\n\n“Egad, Mr. Ritchie, I like your manner,” said he; “and now for a few\ndetails, and you may go to bed.”\n\nHe sat with me half an hour longer, carefully reviewing his\ninstructions, and then he left me to a night of contemplation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. TO ST. LOUIS\n\n\nBy eleven o’clock the next morning I had wound up my affairs, having\narranged with a young lawyer of my acquaintance to take over such cases\nas I had, and I was busy in my room packing my saddle-bags for the\njourney. The warm scents of spring were wafted through the open door\nand window, smells of the damp earth giving forth the green things, and\ntender shades greeted my eyes when I paused and raised my head to think.\nPurple buds littered the black ground before my door-step, and against\nthe living green of the grass I saw the red stain of a robin’s breast as\nhe hopped spasmodically hither and thither, now pausing immovable with\nhis head raised, now tossing triumphantly a wriggling worm from the sod.\nSuddenly he flew away, and I heard a voice from the street side that\nbrought me stark upright.\n\n“Hold there, neighbor; can you direct me to the mansion of that\ncelebrated barrister, Mr. Ritchie?”\n\nThere was no mistaking that voice--it was Nicholas Temple’s. I heard a\nlaugh and an answer, the gate slammed, and Mr. Temple himself in a long\ngray riding-coat, booted and spurred, stood before me.\n\n“Davy,” he cried, “come out here and hug me. Why, you look as if I were\nyour grandmother’s ghost.”\n\n“And if you were,” I answered, “you could not have surprised me more.\nWhere have you been?”\n\n“At Jonesboro, acting the gallant with the widow, winning and losing\nskins and cow-bells and land at rattle-and-snap, horse-racing with that\nwild Mr. Jackson. Faith, he near shot the top of my head off because I\nbeat him at Greasy Cove.”\n\nI laughed, despite my anxiety.\n\n“And Sevier?” I demanded.\n\n“You have not heard how Sevier got off?” exclaimed Nick. “Egad, that\nwas a crowning stroke of genius! Cozby and Evans, Captains Greene and\nGibson, and Sevier’s two boys whom you met on the Nollichucky rode over\nthe mountains to Morganton. Greene and Gibson and Sevier’s boys hid\nthemselves with the horses in a clump outside the town, while Cozby and\nEvans, disguised as bumpkins in hunting shirts, jogged into the town\nwith Sevier’s racing mare between them. They jogged into the town, I\nsay, through the crowds of white trash, and rode up to the court-house\nwhere Sevier was being tried for his life. Evans stood at the open door\nand held the mare and gaped, while Cozby stalked in and shouldered\nhis way to the front within four feet of the bar, like a big, awkward\ncountryman. Jack Sevier saw him, and he saw Evans with the mare outside.\nThen, by thunder, Cozby takes a step right up to the bar and cries\nout, ‘Judge, aren’t you about done with that man?’ Faith, it was like\njudgment day, such a mix-up as there was after that, and Nollichucky\nJack made three leaps and got on the mare, and in the confusion Cozby\nand Evans were off too, and the whole State of North Carolina couldn’t\ncatch ‘em then.” Nick sighed. “I’d have given my soul to have been\nthere,” he said.\n\n“Come in,” said I, for lack of something better.\n\n“Cursed if you haven’t given me a sweet reception, Davy,” said he. “Have\nyou lost your practice, or is there a lady here, you rogue,” and he\npoked into the cupboard with his stick. “Hullo, where are you going\nnow?” he added, his eye falling on the saddle-bags.\n\nI had it on my lips to say, and then I remembered Mr. Wharton’s\ninjunction.\n\n“I’m going on a journey,” said I.\n\n“When?” said Nick.\n\n“I leave in about an hour,” said I.\n\nHe sat down. “Then I leave too,” he said.\n\n“What do you mean, Nick?” I demanded.\n\n“I mean that I will go with you,” said he.\n\n“But I shall be gone three months or more,” I protested.\n\n“I have nothing to do,” said Nick, placidly.\n\nA vague trouble had been working in my mind, but now the full horror\nof it dawned upon me. I was going to St. Louis. Mrs. Temple and Harry\nRiddle were gone there, so Polly Ann had avowed, and Nick could not\nhelp meeting Riddle. Sorely beset, I bent over to roll up a shirt, and\nrefrained from answering.\n\nHe came and laid a hand on my shoulder.\n\n“What the devil ails you, Davy?” he cried. “If it is an elopement, of\ncourse I won’t press you. I’m hanged if I’ll make a third.”\n\n“It is no elopement,” I retorted, my face growing hot in spite of\nmyself.\n\n“Then I go with you,” said he, “for I vow you need taking care of.\nYou can’t put me off, I say. But never in my life have I had such a\nreception, and from my own first cousin, too.”\n\nI was in a quandary, so totally unforeseen was this situation. And then\na glimmer of hope came to me that perhaps his mother and Riddle might\nnot be in St. Louis after all. I recalled the conversation in the cabin,\nand reflected that this wayward pair had stranded on so many beaches,\nhad drifted off again on so many tides, that one place could scarce hold\nthem long. Perchance they had sunk,--who could tell? I turned to Nick,\nwho stood watching me.\n\n“It was not that I did not want you,” I said, “you must believe that.\nI have wanted you ever since that night long ago when I slipped out of\nyour bed and ran away. I am going first to St. Louis and then to\nNew Orleans on a mission of much delicacy, a mission that requires\ndiscretion and secrecy. You may come, with all my heart, with one\ncondition only--that you do not ask my business.”\n\n“Done!” cried Nick. “Davy, I was always sure of you; you are the one\nfixed quantity in my life. To St. Louis, eh, and to New Orleans? Egad,\nwhat havoc we’ll make among the Creole girls. May I bring my nigger?\nHe’ll do things for you too.”\n\n“By all means,” said I, laughing, “only hurry.”\n\n“I’ll run to the inn,” said Nick, “and be back in ten minutes.” He got\nas far as the door, slapped his thigh, and looked back. “Davy, we may\nrun across--”\n\n“Who?” I asked, with a catch of my breath.\n\n“Harry Riddle,” he answered; “and if so, may God have mercy on his\nsoul!”\n\nHe ran down the path, the gate clicked, and I heard him whistling in the\nstreet on his way to the inn.\n\nAfter dinner we rode down to the ferry, Nick on the thoroughbred which\nhad beat Mr. Jackson’s horse, and his man, Benjy, on a scraggly pony\nbehind. Benjy was a small, black negro with a very squat nose, alert and\ntalkative save when Nick turned on him. Benjy had been born at Temple\nBow; he worshipped his master and all that pertained to him, and he\nshowered upon me all the respect and attention that was due to a member\nof the Temple family. For this I was very grateful. It would have been\nan easier journey had we taken a boat down to Fort Massac, but such a\nproceeding might have drawn too much attention to our expedition. I\nhave no space to describe that trip overland, which reminded me at every\nstage of the march against Kaskaskia, the woods, the chocolate streams,\nthe coffee-colored swamps flecked with dead leaves,--and at length the\nprairies, the grass not waist-high now, but young and tender, giving\nforth the acrid smell of spring. Nick was delighted. He made me recount\nevery detail of my trials as a drummer boy, or kept me in continuous\nspells of laughter over his own escapades. In short, I began to realize\nthat we were as near to each other as though we had never been parted.\n\nWe looked down upon Kaskaskia from the self-same spot where I had stood\non the bluff with Colonel Clark, and the sounds were even then the\nsame,--the sweet tones of the church bell and the lowing of the cattle.\nWe found a few Virginians and Pennsylvanians scattered in amongst the\nFrench, the forerunners of that change which was to come over this\ncountry. And we spent the night with my old friend, Father Gibault,\nstill the faithful pastor of his flock; cheerful, though the savings of\nhis lifetime had never been repaid by that country to which he had given\nhis allegiance so freely. Travelling by easy stages, on the afternoon of\nthe second day after leaving Kaskaskia we picked our way down the high\nbluff that rises above the American bottom, and saw below us that yellow\nmonster among the rivers, the Mississippi. A blind monster he seemed,\nsearching with troubled arms among the islands for his bed, swept onward\nby an inexorable force, and on his heaving shoulders he carried great\ntrees pilfered from the unknown forests of the North.\n\nDown in the moist and shady bottom we came upon the log hut of a\nhalf-breed trapper, and he agreed to ferry us across. As for our horses,\na keel boat must be sent after these, and Monsieur Gratiot would no\ndoubt easily arrange for this. And so we found ourselves, about five\no’clock on that Saturday evening, embarked in a wide pirogue on the\ncurrent, dodging the driftwood, avoiding the eddies, and drawing near\nto a village set on a low bluff on the Spanish side and gleaming white\namong the trees. And as I looked, the thought came again like a twinge\nof pain that Mrs. Temple and Riddle might be there, thinking themselves\nsecure in this spot, so removed from the world and its doings.\n\n“How now, my man of mysterious affairs?” cried Nick, from the bottom of\nthe boat; “you are as puckered as a sour persimmon. Have you a treaty\nwith Spain in your pocket or a declaration of war? What can trouble\nyou?”\n\n“Nothing, if you do not,” I answered, smiling.\n\n“Lord send we don’t admire the same lady, then,” said Nick. “Pierrot,”\n he cried, turning to one of the boatmen, “il y a des belles demoiselles\nlà, n’est-ce pas?”\n\nThe man missed a stroke in his astonishment, and the boat swung\nlengthwise in the swift current.\n\n“Dame, Monsieur, il y en a,” he answered.\n\n“Where did you learn French, Nick?” I demanded.\n\n“Mr. Mason had it hammered into me,” he answered carelessly, his eyes on\nthe line of keel boats moored along the shore. Our guides shot the canoe\ndeftly between two of these, the prow grounded in the yellow mud, and we\nlanded on Spanish territory.\n\nWe looked about us while our packs were being unloaded, and the place\nhad a strange flavor in that year of our Lord, 1789. A swarthy boatman\nin a tow shirt with a bright handkerchief on his head stared at us over\nthe gunwale of one of the keel boats, and spat into the still, yellow\nwater; three high-cheeked Indians, with smudgy faces and dirty red\nblankets, regarded us in silent contempt; and by the water-side above\nus was a sled loaded with a huge water cask, a bony mustang pony between\nthe shafts, and a chanting negro dipping gourdfuls from the river. A\nroad slanted up the little limestone bluff, and above and below us stone\nhouses could be seen nestling into the hill, houses higher on the river\nside, and with galleries there. We climbed the bluff, Benjy at our heels\nwith the saddle-bags, and found ourselves on a yellow-clay street lined\nwith grass and wild flowers. A great peace hung over the village, an air\nof a different race, a restfulness strange to a Kentuckian. Clematis and\nhoneysuckle climbed the high palings, and behind the privacy of these,\nlow, big-chimneyed houses of limestone, weathered gray, could be seen,\ntheir roofs sloping in gentle curves to the shaded porches in front;\nor again, houses of posts set upright in the ground and these filled\nbetween with plaster, and so immaculately whitewashed that they gleamed\nagainst the green of the trees which shaded them. Behind the houses was\noften a kind of pink-and-cream paradise of flowering fruit trees, so\ndear to the French settlers. There were vineyards, too, and thrifty\npatches of vegetables, and lines of flowers set in the carefully raked\nmould.\n\nWe walked on, enraptured by the sights around us, by the heavy scent\nof the roses and the blossoms. Here was a quaint stone horse-mill, a\nstable, or a barn set uncouthly on the street; a baker’s shop, with a\nglimpse of the white-capped baker through the shaded doorway, and an\nappetizing smell of hot bread in the air. A little farther on we heard\nthe tinkle of the blacksmith’s hammer, and the man himself looked up\nfrom where the hoof rested on his leather apron to give us a kindly\n“Bon soir, Messieurs,” as we passed. And here was a cabaret, with the\ninevitable porch, from whence came the sharp click of billiard balls.\n\nWe walked on, stopping now and again to peer between the palings, when\nwe heard, amidst the rattling of a cart and the jingling of bells, a\nchorus of voices:--\n\n “À cheval, à cheval, pour aller voir ma mie,\n Lon, lon, la!”\n\nA shaggy Indian pony came ambling around the corner between the long\nshafts of a charette. A bareheaded young man in tow shirt and trousers\nwas driving, and three laughing girls were seated on the stools in the\ncart behind him. Suddenly, before I quite realized what had happened,\nthe young man pulled up the pony, the girls fell silent, and Nick was\nstanding in the middle of the road, with his hat in his hand, bowing\nelaborately.\n\n“Je vous salue, Mesdemoiselles,” he cried, “mes anges à char-à-banc.\nPouvez-vous me diriger chez Monsieur Gratiot?”\n\n“Sapristi!” exclaimed the young man, but he laughed. The young women\nstood up, giggling, and peered at Nick over the young man’s shoulder.\nOne of them wore a fresh red-and-white calamanco gown. She had a\ncomplexion of ivory tinged with red, raven hair, and dusky, long-lashed,\nmischievous eyes brimming with merriment.\n\n“Volontiers, Monsieur,” she answered, before the others could catch\ntheir breath, “première droite et première gauche. Allons, Gaspard!” she\ncried, tapping the young man sharply on the shoulder, “es tu fou?”\n\nGaspard came to himself, flicked the pony, and they went off down the\nroad with shouts of laughter, while Nick stood waving his hat until they\nturned the corner.\n\n“Egad,” said he, “I’d take to the highway if I could be sure of holding\nup such a cargo every time. Off with you, Benjy, and find out where\nshe lives,” he cried; and the obedient Benjy dropped the saddle-bags as\nthough such commands were not uncommon.\n\n“Pick up those bags, Benjy,” said I, laughing.\n\nBenjy glanced uncertainly at his master.\n\n“Do as I tell you, you black scalawag,” said Nick, “or I’ll tan you.\nWhat are you waiting for?”\n\n“Marse Dave--” began Benjy, rolling his eyes in discomfiture.\n\n“Look you, Nick Temple,” said I, “when you shipped with me you promised\nthat I should command. I can’t afford to have the town about our ears.”\n\n“Oh, very well, if you put it that way,” said Nick. “A little honest\ndiversion--Pick up the bags, Benjy, and follow the parson.”\n\nObeying Mademoiselle’s directions, we trudged on until we came to a\ncomfortable stone house surrounded by trees and set in a half-block\nbordered by a seven-foot paling. Hardly had we opened the gate when a\ntall gentleman of grave demeanor and sober dress rose from his seat on\nthe porch, and I recognized my friend of Cahokia days, Monsieur Gratiot.\nHe was a little more portly, his hair was dressed now in an eelskin,\nand he looked every inch the man of affairs that he was. He greeted\nus kindly and bade us come up on the porch, where he read my letter of\nintroduction.\n\n“Why,” he exclaimed immediately, giving me a cordial grasp of the hand\n“of course. The strategist, the John Law, the reader of character of\nColonel Clark’s army. Yes, and worse, the prophet, Mr. Ritchie.”\n\n“And why worse, sir?” I asked.\n\n“You predicted that Congress would never repay me for the little loan I\nadvanced to your Colonel.”\n\n“It was not such a little loan, Monsieur,” I said.\n\n“N’importe,” said he; “I went to Richmond with my box of scrip and\npromissory notes, but I was not ill repaid. If I did not get my money,\nI acquired, at least, a host of distinguished acquaintances. But, Mr.\nRitchie, you must introduce me to your friend.”\n\n“My cousin, Mr. Nicholas Temple,” I said.\n\nMonsieur Gratiot looked at him fixedly.\n\n“Of the Charlestown Temples?” he asked, and a sudden vague fear seized\nme.\n\n“Yes,” said Nick, “there was once a family of that name.”\n\n“And now?” said Monsieur Gratiot, puzzled.\n\n“Now,” said Nick, “now they are become a worthless lot of refugees and\noutlaws, who by good fortune have escaped the gallows.”\n\nBefore Monsieur Gratiot could answer, a child came running around the\ncorner of the house and stood, surprised, staring at us. Nick made a\nface, stooped down, and twirled his finger. Shouting with a terrified\nglee, the boy fled to the garden path, Nick after him.\n\n“I like Mr. Temple,” said Monsieur Gratiot, smiling. “He is young, but\nhe seems to have had a history.”\n\n“The Revolution ruined many families--his was one,” I answered, with\nwhat firmness of tone I could muster. And then Nick came back, carrying\nthe shouting youngster on his shoulders. At that instant a lady appeared\nin the doorway, leading another child, and we were introduced to Madame\nGratiot.\n\n“Gentlemen,” said Monsieur Gratiot, “you must make my house your home.\nI fear your visit will not be as long as I could wish, Mr. Ritchie,” he\nadded, turning to me, “if Mr. Wharton correctly states your business. I\nhave an engagement to have my furs in New Orleans by a certain time.\nI am late in loading, and as there is a moon I am sending off my boats\nto-morrow night. The men will have to work on Sunday.”\n\n“We were fortunate to come in such good season,” I answered.\n\nAfter a delicious supper of gumbo, a Creole dish, of fricassee, of crême\nbrûlé, of red wine and fresh wild strawberries, we sat on the porch. The\ncrickets chirped in the garden, the moon cast fantastic shadows from the\npecan tree on the grass, while Nick, struggling with his French, talked\nto Madame Gratiot; and now and then their gay laughter made Monsieur\nGratiot pause and smile as he talked to me of my errand. It seemed\nstrange to me that a man who had lost so much by his espousal of our\ncause should still be faithful to the American republic. Although he\nlived in Louisiana, he had never renounced the American allegiance which\nhe had taken at Cahokia. He regarded with no favor the pretensions of\nSpain toward Kentucky. And (remarkably enough) he looked forward even\nthen to the day when Louisiana would belong to the republic. I exclaimed\nat this.\n\n“Mr. Ritchie,” said he, “the most casual student of your race must come\nto the same conclusion. You have seen for yourself how they have overrun\nand conquered Kentucky and the Cumberland districts, despite a hideous\nwarfare waged by all the tribes. Your people will not be denied, and\nwhen they get to Louisiana, they will take it, as they take everything\nelse.”\n\nHe was a man strong in argument, was Monsieur Gratiot, for he loved it.\nAnd he beat me fairly.\n\n“Nay,” he said finally, “Spain might as well try to dam the Mississippi\nas to dam your commerce on it. As for France, I love her, though my\npeople were exiled to Switzerland by the Edict of Nantes. But France is\nrotten through the prodigality of her kings and nobles, and she cannot\nhold Louisiana. The kingdom is sunk in debt.” He cleared his throat. “As\nfor this Wilkinson of whom you speak, I know something of him. I have\nno doubt that Miro pensions him, but I know Miro likewise, and you will\nobtain no proof of that. You will, however, discover in New Orleans\nmany things of interest to your government and to the Federal party in\nKentucky. Colonel Chouteau and I will give you letters to certain French\ngentlemen in New Orleans who can be trusted. There is Saint-Gré, for\ninstance, who puts a French Louisiana into his prayers. He has never\nforgiven O’Reilly and his Spaniards for the murder of his father in\nsixty-nine. Saint-Gré is a good fellow,--a cousin of the present Marquis\nin France,--and his ancestors held many positions of trust in the\ncolony under the French régime. He entertains lavishly at Les Îles, his\nplantation on the Mississippi. He has the gossip of New Orleans at his\ntongue’s tip, and you will be suspected of nothing save a desire\nto amuse yourselves if you go there.” He paused, interrupted by the\nlaughter of the others. “When strangers of note or of position\ndrift here and pass on to New Orleans, I always give them letters to\nSaint-Gré. He has a charming daughter and a worthless son.”\n\nMonsieur Gratiot produced his tabatière and took a pinch of snuff. I\nsummoned my courage for the topic which had trembled all the evening on\nmy lips.\n\n“Some years ago, Monsieur Gratiot, a lady and a gentleman were rescued\non the Wilderness Trail in Kentucky. They left us for St. Louis. Did\nthey come here?”\n\nMonsieur Gratiot leaned forward quickly.\n\n“They were people of quality?” he demanded.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And their name?”\n\n“They--they did not say.”\n\n“It must have been the Clives,” he cried; “it can have been no other.\nTell me--a woman still beautiful, commanding, of perhaps eight and\nthirty? A woman who had a sorrow?--a great sorrow, though we have never\nlearned it. And Mr. Clive, a man of fashion, ill content too, and pining\nfor the life of a capital?”\n\n“Yes,” I said eagerly, my voice sinking near to a whisper, “yes--it is\nthey. And are they here?”\n\nMonsieur Gratiot took another pinch of snuff. It seemed an age before he\nanswered:--\n\n“It is curious that you should mention them, for I gave them letters to\nNew Orleans,--amongst others, to Saint-Gré. Mrs. Clive was--what shall\nI say?--haunted. Monsieur Clive talked of nothing but Paris, where they\nhad lived once. And at last she gave in. They have gone there.”\n\n“To Paris?” I said, taking breath.\n\n“Yes. It is more than a year ago,” he continued, seeming not to notice\nmy emotion; “they went by way of New Orleans, in one of Chouteau’s\nboats. Mrs. Clive seemed a woman with a great sorrow.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. “CHERCHEZ LA FEMME”\n\n\nSunday came with the soft haziness of a June morning, and the dew sucked\na fresh fragrance from the blossoms and the grass. I looked out of our\nwindow at the orchard, all pink and white in the early sun, and across\na patch of clover to the stone kitchen. A pearly, feathery smoke was\nwafted from the chimney, a delicious aroma of Creole coffee pervaded the\nodor of the blossoms, and a cotton-clad negro à pieds nus came down the\npath with two steaming cups and knocked at our door. He who has tasted\nCreole coffee will never forget it. The effect of it was lost upon Nick,\nfor he laid down the cup, sighed, and promptly went to sleep again,\nwhile I dressed and went forth to make his excuses to the family. I\nfound Monsieur and Madame with their children walking among the flowers.\nMadame laughed.\n\n“He is charming, your cousin,” said she. “Let him sleep, by all means,\nuntil after Mass. Then you must come with us to Madame Chouteau’s, my\nmother’s. Her children and grandchildren dine with her every Sunday.”\n\n“Madame Chouteau, my mother-in-law, is the queen regent of St. Louis,\nMr. Ritchie,” said Monsieur Gratiot, gayly. “We are all afraid of her,\nand I warn you that she is a very determined and formidable personage.\nShe is the widow of the founder of St. Louis, the Sieur Laclède,\nalthough she prefers her own name. She rules us with a strong hand,\ndispenses justice, settles disputes, and--sometimes indulges in them\nherself. It is her right.”\n\n“You will see a very pretty French custom of submission to parents,”\nsaid Madame Gratiot. “And afterwards there is a ball.”\n\n“A ball!” I exclaimed involuntarily.\n\n“It may seem very strange to you, Mr. Ritchie, but we believe that\nSunday was made to enjoy. They will have time to attend the ball before\nyou send them down the river?” she added mischievously, turning to her\nhusband.\n\n“Certainly,” said he, “the loading will not be finished before eight\no’clock.”\n\nPresently Madame Gratiot went off to Mass, while I walked with Monsieur\nGratiot to a storehouse near the river’s bank, whence the skins, neatly\npacked and numbered, were being carried to the boats on the\nsweating shoulders of the negroes, the half-breeds, and the Canadian\nboatmen,--bulky bales of yellow elk, from the upper plains of the\nMissouri, of buffalo and deer and bear, and priceless little packages\nof the otter and the beaver trapped in the green shade of the endless\nNorthern forests, and brought hither in pirogues down the swift river by\nthe red tribesmen and Canadian adventurers.\n\nAfterwards I strolled about the silent village. Even the cabarets were\ndeserted. A private of the Spanish Louisiana Regiment in a dirty uniform\nslouched behind the palings in front of the commandant’s quarters,--a\nquaint stone house set against the hill, with dormer windows in its\ncurving roof, with a wide porch held by eight sturdy hewn pillars;\nhere and there the muffled figure of a prowling Indian loitered, or a\nbarefooted negress shuffled along by the fence crooning a folk-song. All\nthe world had obeyed the call of the church bell save these--and Nick. I\nbethought myself of Nick, and made my way back to Monsieur Gratiot’s.\n\nI found my cousin railing at Benjy, who had extracted from the\nsaddle-bags a wondrous gray suit of London cut in which to array his\nmaster. Clothes became Nick’s slim figure remarkably. This coat was cut\naway smartly, like a uniform, towards the tails, and was brought in at\nthe waist with an infinite art.\n\n“Whither now, my conquistador?” I said.\n\n“To Mass,” said he.\n\n“To Mass!” I exclaimed; “but you have slept through the greater part of\nit.”\n\n“The best part is to come,” said Nick, giving a final touch to his\nneck-band. Followed by Benjy’s adoring eyes, he started out of the door,\nand I followed him perforce. We came to the little church, of upright\nlogs and plaster, with its crudely shingled, peaked roof, with its tiny\nbelfry crowned by a cross, with its porches on each side shading the\nline of windows there. Beside the church, a little at the back, was the\ncuré’s modest house of stone, and at the other hand, under spreading\ntrees, the graveyard with its rough wooden crosses. And behind these\ngraves rose the wooded hill that stretched away towards the wilderness.\n\nWhat a span of life had been theirs who rested here! Their youth,\nperchance, had been spent amongst the crooked streets of some French\nvillage, streets lined by red-tiled houses and crossing limpid streams\nby quaint bridges. Death had overtaken them beside a monster tawny\nriver of which their imaginations had not conceived, a river which draws\ntribute from the remote places of an unknown land,--a river, indeed,\nwhich, mixing all the waters, seemed to symbolize a coming race which\nwas to conquer the land by its resistless flow, even as the Mississippi\nbore relentlessly towards the sea.\n\nThese were my own thoughts as I listened to the tones of the priest as\nthey came, droningly, out of the door, while Nick was exchanging jokes\nin doubtful French with some half-breeds leaning against the palings.\nThen we heard benches scraping on the floor, and the congregation began\nto file out.\n\nThose who reached the steps gave back, respectfully, and there came an\nelderly lady in a sober turban, a black mantilla wrapped tightly about\nher shoulders, and I made no doubt that she was Monsieur Gratiot’s\nmother-in-law, Madame Chouteau, she whom he had jestingly called the\nqueen regent. I was sure of this when I saw Madame Gratiot behind her.\nMadame Chouteau indeed had the face of authority, a high-bridged nose, a\ndetermined chin, a mouth that shut tightly. Madame Gratiot presented us\nto her mother, and as she passed on to the gate Madame Chouteau reminded\nus that we were to dine with her at two.\n\nAfter her the congregation, the well-to-do and the poor alike, poured\nout of the church and spread in merry groups over the grass: keel\nboatmen in tow shirts and party-colored worsted belts, the blacksmith,\nthe shoemaker, the farmer of a small plot in the common fields in\nlarge cotton pantaloons and light-wove camlet coat, the more favored in\nskull-caps, linen small-clothes, cotton stockings, and silver-buckled\nshoes,--every man pausing, dipping into his tabatière, for a word with\nhis neighbor. The women, too, made a picture strange to our eyes, the\nmatrons in jacket and petticoat, a Madras handkerchief flung about their\nshoulders, the girls in fresh cottonade or calamanco.\n\nAll at once cries of “‘Polyte! ‘Polyte!” were heard, and a nimble young\nman with a jester-like face hopped around the corner of the church,\ntrundling a barrel. Behind ‘Polyte came two rotund little men perspiring\nfreely, and laden down with various articles,--a bird-cage with two\nyellow birds, a hat-trunk, an inlaid card box, a roll of scarlet cloth,\nand I know not what else. They deposited these on the grass beside the\nbarrel, which ‘Polyte had set on end and proceeded to mount, encouraged\nby the shouts of his friends, who pressed around the barrel.\n\n“It’s an auction,” I said.\n\nBut Nick did not hear me. I followed his glance to the far side of the\ncircle, and my eye was caught by a red ribbon, a blush that matched it.\nA glance shot from underneath long lashes,--but not for me. Beside\nthe girl, and palpably uneasy, stood the young man who had been called\nGaspard.\n\n“Ah,” said I, “your angel of the tumbrel.”\n\nBut Nick had pulled off his hat and was sweeping her a bow. The girl\nlooked down, smoothing her ribbon, Gaspard took a step forward, and\nother young women near us tittered with delight. The voice of Hippolyte\nrolling his r’s called out in a French dialect:--\n\n“M’ssieurs et Mesdames, ce sont des effets d’un pauvre officier qui est\nmort. Who will buy?” He opened the hat-trunk, produced an antiquated\nbeaver with a gold cord, and surveyed it with a covetousness that was\nadmirably feigned. For ‘Polyte was an actor. “M’ssieurs, to own such a\nhat were a patent of nobility. Am I bid twenty livres?”\n\nThere was a loud laughter, and he was bid four.\n\n“Gaspard,” cried the auctioneer, addressing the young man of the\ntumbrel, “Suzanne would no longer hesitate if she saw you in such a hat.\nAnd with the trunk, too. Ah, mon Dieu, can you afford to miss it?”\n\nThe crowd howled, Suzanne simpered, and Gaspard turned as pink as\nclover. But he was not to be bullied. The hat was sold to an elderly\nperson, the red cloth likewise; a pot of grease went to a housewife, and\nthere was a veritable scramble for the box of playing cards; and at last\nHippolyte held up the wooden cage with the fluttering yellow birds.\n\n“Ha!” he cried, his eyes on Gaspard once more, “a gentle present--a\npresent to make a heart relent. And Monsieur Léon, perchance you will\nmake a bid, although they are not gamecocks.”\n\nInstantly, from somewhere under the barrel, a cock crew. Even the yellow\nbirds looked surprised, and as for ‘Polyte, he nearly dropped the cage.\nOne elderly person crossed himself. I looked at Nick. His face was\nimpassive, but suddenly I remembered his boyhood gift, how he had\nimitated the monkeys, and I began to shake with inward laughter. There\nwas an uncomfortable silence.\n\n“Peste, c’est la magie!” said an old man at last, searching with an\nuncertain hand for his snuff.\n\n“Monsieur,” cried Nick to the auctioneer, “I will make a bid. But first\nyou must tell me whether they are cocks or yellow birds.”\n\n“Parbleu,” answered the puzzled Hippolyte, “that I do not know,\nMonsieur.”\n\nEverybody looked at Nick, including Suzanne.\n\n“Very well,” said he, “I will make a bid. And if they turn out to be\ngamecocks, I will fight them with Monsieur Léon behind the cabaret. Two\nlivres!”\n\nThere was a laugh, as of relief.\n\n“Three!” cried Gaspard, and his voice broke.\n\nHippolyte looked insulted.\n\n“M’ssieurs,” he shouted, “they are from the Canaries. Diable, un berger\ndoit être généreux.”\n\nAnother laugh, and Gaspard wiped the perspiration from his face.\n\n“Five!” said he.\n\n“Six!” said Nick, and the villagers turned to him in wonderment. What\ncould such a fine Monsieur want with two yellow birds?\n\n“En avant, Gaspard,” said Hippolyte, and Suzanne shot another barbed\nglance in our direction.\n\n“Seven,” muttered Gaspard.\n\n“Eight!” said Nick, immediately.\n\n“Nine,” said Gaspard.\n\n“Ten,” said Nick.\n\n“Ten,” cried Hippolyte, “I am offered ten livres for the yellow birds.\nUne bagatelle! Onze, Gaspard! Onze! onze livres, pour l’amour de\nSuzanne!”\n\nBut Gaspard was silent. No appeals, entreaties, or taunts could persuade\nhim to bid more. And at length Hippolyte, with a gesture of disdain,\nhanded Nick the cage, as though he were giving it away.\n\n“Monsieur,” he said, “the birds are yours, since there are no more\nlovers who are worthy of the name. They do not exist.”\n\n“Monsieur,” answered Nick, “it is to disprove that statement that I\nhave bought the birds. Mademoiselle,” he added, turning to the flushing\nSuzanne, “I pray that you will accept this present with every assurance\nof my humble regard.”\n\nMademoiselle took the cage, and amidst the laughter of the village at\nthe discomfiture of poor Gaspard, swept Nick a frightened courtesy,--one\nthat nevertheless was full of coquetry. And at that instant, to cap the\nsituation, a rotund little man with a round face under a linen biretta\ngrasped Nick by the hand, and cried in painful but sincere English:--\n\n“Monsieur, you mek my daughter ver’ happy. She want those bird ever\nsence Captain Lopez he die. Monsieur, I am Jean Baptiste Lenoir, Colonel\nChouteau’s miller, and we ver’ happy to see you at the pon’.”\n\n“If Monsieur will lead the way,” said Nick, instantly, taking the little\nman by the arm.\n\n“But you are to dine at Madame Chouteau’s,” I expostulated.\n\n“To be sure,” said he. “Au revoir, Monsieur. Au revoir, Mademoiselle.\nPlus tard, Mademoiselle; nous danserons plus tard.”\n\n“What devil inhabits you?” I said, when I had got him started on the way\nto Madame Chouteau’s.\n\n“Your own, at present, Davy,” he answered, laying a hand on my shoulder,\n“else I should be on the way to the pon’ with Lenoir. But the ball is to\ncome,” and he executed several steps in anticipation. “Davy, I am sorry\nfor you.”\n\n“Why?” I demanded, though feeling a little self-commiseration also.\n\n“You will never know how to enjoy yourself,” said he, with conviction.\n\nMadame Chouteau lived in a stone house, wide and low, surrounded by\ntrees and gardens. It was a pretty tribute of respect her children and\ngrandchildren paid her that day, in accordance with the old French usage\nof honoring the parent. I should like to linger on the scene, and tell\nhow Nick made them all laugh over the story of Suzanne Lenoir and the\nyellow birds, and how the children pressed around him and made him\nimitate all the denizens of wood and field, amid deafening shrieks of\ndelight.\n\n“You have probably delayed Gaspard’s wooing another year, Mr. Temple.\nSuzanne is a sad coquette,” said Colonel Auguste Chouteau, laughing, as\nwe set out for the ball.\n\nThe sun was hanging low over the western hills as we approached the\nbarracks, and out of the open windows came the merry, mad sounds of\nviolin, guitar, and flageolet, the tinkle of a triangle now and then,\nthe shouts of laughter, the shuffle of many feet over the puncheons.\nWithin the door, smiling and benignant, unmindful of the stifling\natmosphere, sat the black-robed village priest talking volubly to an\nelderly man in a scarlet cap, and several stout ladies ranged along the\nwall: beyond them, on a platform, Zéron, the baker, fiddled as though\nhis life depended on it, the perspiration dripping from his brow,\nfrowning, gesticulating at them with the flageolet and the triangle. And\nin a dim, noisy, heated whirl the whole village went round and round and\nround under the low ceiling in the valse, young and old, rich and poor,\nhigh and low, the sound of their laughter and the scraping of their feet\ncut now and again by an agonized squeak from Zéron’s fiddle. From time\nto time a staggering, panting couple would fling themselves out, help\nthemselves liberally to pink sirop from the bowl on the side table,\nand then fling themselves in once more, until Zéron stopped from sheer\nexhaustion, to tune up for a pas de deux.\n\nAcross the room, by the sirop bowl, a pair of red ribbons flaunted, a\npair of eyes sent a swift challenge, Zéron and his assistants struck\nup again, and there in a corner was Nick Temple, with characteristic\neffrontery attempting a pas de deux with Suzanne. Though Nick was\nignorant, he was not ungraceful, and the village laughed and admired.\nAnd when Zéron drifted back into a valse he seized Suzanne’s plump\nfigure in his arms and bore her, unresisting, like a prize among\nthe dancers, avoiding alike the fat and unwieldy, the clumsy and the\nspiteful. For a while the tune held its mad pace, and ended with a\nshriek and a snap on a high note, for Zéron had broken a string. Amid a\nburst of laughter from the far end of the room I saw Nick stop before an\nopen window in which a prying Indian was framed, swing Suzanne at arm’s\nlength, and bow abruptly at the brave with a grunt that startled him\ninto life.\n\n“Va-t’en, méchant!” shrieked Suzanne, excitedly.\n\nPoor Gaspard! Poor Hippolyte! They would gain Suzanne for a dance only\nto have her snatched away at the next by the slim and reckless young\ngentleman in the gray court clothes. Little Nick cared that the affair\nsoon became the amusement of the company. From time to time, as he\nglided past with Suzanne on his shoulder, he nodded gayly to Colonel\nChouteau or made a long face at me, and to save our souls we could not\nhelp laughing.\n\n“The girl has met her match, for she has played shuttle-cock with all\nthe hearts in the village,” said Monsieur Chouteau. “But perhaps it is\njust as well that Mr. Temple is leaving to-night. I have signed a bon,\nMr. Ritchie, by which you can obtain money at New Orleans. And do\nnot forget to present our letter to Monsieur de Saint Gré. He has a\ndaughter, by the way, who will be more of a match for your friend’s\nfascinations than Suzanne.”\n\nThe evening faded into twilight, with no signs of weariness from the\ndancers. And presently there stood beside us Jean Baptiste Lenoir, the\nColonel’s miller.\n\n“B’soir, Monsieur le Colonel,” he said, touching his skull-cap, “the\nwater is very low. You fren’,” he added, turning to me, “he stay long\ntime in St. Louis?”\n\n“He is going away to-night,--in an hour or so,” I answered, with\nthanksgiving in my heart.\n\n“I am sorry,” said Monsieur Lenoir, politely, but his looks belied his\nwords. “He is ver’ fond Suzanne. Peut-être he marry her, but I think\nnot. I come away from France to escape the fine gentlemen; long time ago\nthey want to run off with my wife. She was like Suzanne.”\n\n“How long ago did you come from France, Monsieur?” I asked, to get away\nfrom an uncomfortable subject.\n\n“It is twenty years,” said he, dreamily, in French. “I was born in the\nQuartier Saint Jean, on the harbor of the city of Marseilles near\nNotre Dame de la Nativité.” And he told of a tall, uneven house of four\nstories, with a high pitched roof, and a little barred door and window\nat the bottom giving out upon the rough cobbles. He spoke of the smell\nof the sea, of the rollicking sailors who surged through the narrow\nstreet to embark on his Majesty’s men-of-war, and of the King’s white\nsoldiers in ranks of four going to foreign lands. And how he had become\na farmer, the tenant of a country family. Excitement grew on him, and he\nmopped his brow with his blue rumal handkerchief.\n\n“They desire all, the nobles,” he cried, “I make the land good, and\nthey seize it. I marry a pretty wife, and Monsieur le Comte he want her.\nL’bon Dieu,” he added bitterly, relapsing into French. “France is for\nthe King and the nobility, Monsieur. The poor have but little chance\nthere. In the country I have seen the peasants eat roots, and in the\ncity the poor devour the refuse from the houses of the rich. It was we\nwho paid for their luxuries, and with mine own eyes I have seen their\ngilded coaches ride down weak men and women in the streets. But it\ncannot last. They will murder Louis and burn the great châteaux. I, who\nspeak to you, am of the people, Monsieur, I know it.”\n\nThe sun had long set, and with flint and tow they were touching\nthe flame to the candles, which flickered transparent yellow in the\ndeepening twilight. So absorbed had I become in listening to Lenoir’s\ndescription that I had forgotten Nick. Now I searched for him among the\npromenading figures, and missed him. In vain did I seek for a glimpse\nof Suzanne’s red ribbons, and I grew less and less attentive to the\nmiller’s reminiscences and arraignments of the nobility. Had Nick indeed\nrun away with his daughter?\n\nThe dancing went on with unabated zeal, and through the open door in the\nfainting azure of the sky the summer moon hung above the hills like a\ngreat yellow orange. Striving to hide my uneasiness, I made my farewells\nto Madame Chouteau’s sons and daughters and their friends, and with\nColonel Chouteau I left the hall and began to walk towards Monsieur\nGratiot’s, hoping against hope that Nick had gone there to change. But\nwe had scarce reached the road before we could see two figures in the\ndistance, hazily outlined in the mid-light of the departed sun and the\ncoming moon. The first was Monsieur Gratiot himself, the second Benjy.\nMonsieur Gratiot took me by the hand.\n\n“I regret to inform you, Mr. Ritchie,” said he, politely, “that my keel\nboats are loaded and ready to leave. Were you on any other errand I\nshould implore you to stay with us.”\n\n“Is Temple at your house?” I asked faintly.\n\n“Why, no,” said Monsieur Gratiot; “I thought he was with you at the\nball.”\n\n“Where is your master?” I demanded sternly of Benjy.\n\n“I ain’t seed him, Marse Dave, sence I put him inter dem fine clothes\n‘at he w’ars a-cou’tin’.”\n\n“He has gone off with the girl,” put in Colonel Chouteau, laughing.\n\n“But where?” I said, with growing anger at this lack of consideration on\nNick’s part.\n\n“I’ll warrant that Gaspard or Hippolyte Beaujais will know, if they can\nbe found,” said the Colonel. “Neither of them willingly lets the girl\nout of his sight.”\n\nAs we hurried back towards the throbbing sounds of Zéron’s fiddle I\napologized as best I might to Monsieur Gratiot, declaring that if Nick\nwere not found within the half-hour I would leave without him. My host\nprotested that an hour or so would make no difference. We were about to\npass through the group of loungers that loitered by the gate when the\nsound of rapid footsteps arrested us, and we turned to confront two\npanting and perspiring young men who halted beside us. One was Hippolyte\nBeaujais, more fantastic than ever as he faced the moon, and the other\nwas Gaspard. They had plainly made a common cause, but it was Hippolyte\nwho spoke.\n\n“Monsieur,” he cried, “you seek your friend? Ha, we have found him,--we\nwill lead you to him.”\n\n“Where is he?” said Colonel Chouteau, repressing another laugh.\n\n“On the pond, Monsieur,--in a boat, Monsieur, with Suzanne, Monsieur le\nColonel! And, moreover, he will come ashore for no one.”\n\n“Parbleu,” said the Colonel, “I should think not for any arguments that\nyou two could muster. But we will go there.”\n\n“How far is it?” I asked, thinking of Monsieur Gratiot.\n\n“About a mile,” said Colonel Chouteau, “a pleasant walk.”\n\nWe stepped out, Hippolyte and Gaspard running in front, the Colonel and\nMonsieur Gratiot and myself following; and a snicker which burst out\nnow and then told us that Benjy was in the rear. On any other errand I\nshould have thought the way beautiful, for the country road, rutted by\nwooden wheels, wound in and out through pleasant vales and over gentle\nrises, whence we caught glimpses from time to time of the Mississippi\ngleaming like molten gold to the eastward. Here and there, nestling\nagainst the gentle slopes of the hillside clearing, was a low-thatched\nfarmhouse among its orchards. As we walked, Nick’s escapade, instead of\nangering Monsieur Gratiot, seemed to present itself to him in a more and\nmore ridiculous aspect, and twice he nudged me to call my attention to\nthe two vengefully triumphant figures silhouetted against the moon\nahead of us. From time to time also I saw Colonel Chouteau shaking\nwith laughter. As for me, it was impossible to be angry at Nick for\nany space. Nobody else would have carried off a girl in the face of her\nrivals for a moonlight row on a pond a mile away.\n\nAt length we began to go down into the valley where Chouteau’s pond\nwas, and we caught glimpses of the shimmering of its waters through the\ntrees, ay, and presently heard them tumbling lightly over the mill-dam.\nThe spot was made for romance,--a sequestered vale, clad with forest\ntrees, cleared a little by the water-side, where Monsieur Lenoir raised\nhis maize and his vegetables. Below the mill, so Monsieur Gratiot told\nme, where the creek lay in pools on its limestone bed, the village\nwashing was done; and every Monday morning bare-legged negresses strode\nup this road, the bundles of clothes balanced on their heads, the\npaddles in their hands, followed by a stream of black urchins who\ntempted Providence to drown them.\n\nDown in the valley we came to a path that branched from the road and\nled under the oaks and hickories towards the pond, and we had not taken\ntwenty paces in it before the notes of a guitar and the sound of a voice\nreached our ears. And then, when the six of us stood huddled in the rank\ngrowth at the water’s edge, we saw a boat floating idly in the forest\nshadow on the far side.\n\nI put my hand to my mouth.\n\n“Nick!” I shouted.\n\nThere came for an answer, with the careless and unskilful thrumming of\nthe guitar, the end of the verse:--\n\n “Thine eyes are bright as the stars at night,\n Thy cheeks like the rose of the dawning, oh!”\n\n“Hélas!” exclaimed Hippolyte, sadly, “there is no other boat.”\n\n“Nick!” I shouted again, reënforced vociferously by the others.\n\nThe music ceased, there came feminine laughter across the water, then\nNick’s voice, in French that dared everything:--\n\n“Go away and amuse yourselves at the dance. Peste, it is scarce an hour\nago I threatened to row ashore and break your heads. Allez vous en,\njaloux!”\n\nA scream of delight from Suzanne followed this sally, which was received\nby Gaspard and Hippolyte with a rattle of sacrés, and--despite our\nirritation--the Colonel, Monsieur Gratiot, and myself with a burst of\ninvoluntary laughter.\n\n“Parbleu,” said the Colonel, choking, “it is a pity to disturb such a\none. Gratiot, if it was my boat, I’d delay the departure till morning.”\n\n“Indeed, I shall have had no small entertainment as a solace,” said\nMonsieur Gratiot. “Listen!”\n\nThe tinkle of the guitar was heard again, and Nick’s voice, strong and\nfull and undisturbed:--\n\n “S’posin’ I was to go to N’ O’leans an’ take sick an’ die,\n Like a bird into the country my spirit would fly.\n Go ‘way, old man, and leave me alone,\n For I am a stranger and a long way from home.”\n\nThere was a murmur of voices in the boat, the sound of a paddle gurgling\nas it dipped, and the dugout shot out towards the middle of the pond and\ndrifted again.\n\nI shouted once more at the top of my lungs:--\n\n“Come in here, Nick, instantly!”\n\nThere was a moment’s silence.\n\n“By gad, it’s Parson Davy!” I heard Nick exclaim. “Halloo, Davy, how the\ndeuce did you get there?”\n\n“No thanks to you,” I retorted hotly. “Come in.”\n\n“Lord,” said he, “is it time to go to New Orleans?”\n\n“One might think New Orleans was across the street,” said Monsieur\nGratiot. “What an attitude of mind!”\n\nThe dugout was coming towards us now, propelled by easy strokes, and\nNick could be heard the while talking in low tones to Suzanne. We could\nonly guess at the tenor of his conversation, which ceased entirely as\nthey drew near. At length the prow slid in among the rushes, was seized\nvigorously by Gaspard and Hippolyte, and the boat hauled ashore.\n\n“Thank you very much, Messieurs; you are most obliging,” said Nick. And\ntaking Suzanne by the hand, he helped her gallantly over the gunwale.\n“Monsieur,” he added, turning in his most irresistible manner to\nMonsieur Gratiot, “if I have delayed the departure of your boat, I\nam exceedingly sorry. But I appeal to you if I have not the best of\nexcuses.”\n\nAnd he bowed to Suzanne, who stood beside him coyly, looking down. As\nfor ‘Polyte and Gaspard, they were quite breathless between rage and\nastonishment. But Colonel Chouteau began to laugh.\n\n“Diable, Monsieur, you are right,” he cried, “and rather than have\nmissed this entertainment I would pay Gratiot for his cargo.”\n\n“Au revoir, Mademoiselle,” said Nick, “I will return when I am released\nfrom bondage. When this terrible mentor relaxes vigilance, I will escape\nand make my way back to you through the forests.”\n\n“Oh!” cried Mademoiselle to me, “you will let him come back, Monsieur.”\n\n“Assuredly, Mademoiselle,” I said, “but I have known him longer than\nyou, and I tell you that in a month he will not wish to come back.”\n\nHippolyte gave a grunt of approval to this plain speech. Suzanne\nexclaimed, but before Nick could answer footsteps were heard in the\npath and Lenoir himself, perspiring, panting, exhausted, appeared in the\nmidst of us.\n\n“Suzanne!” he cried, “Suzanne!” And turning to Nick, he added quite\nsimply, “So, Monsieur, you did not run off with her, after all?”\n\n“There was no place to run, Monsieur,” answered Nick.\n\n“Praise be to God for that!” said the miller, heartily; “there is some\nadvantage in living in the wilderness, when everything is said.”\n\n“I shall come back and try, Monsieur,” said Nick.\n\nThe miller raised his hands.\n\n“I assure you that he will not, Monsieur,” I put in.\n\nHe thanked me profusely, and suddenly an idea seemed to strike him.\n\n“There is the priest,” he cried; “Monsieur le curé retires late. There\nis the priest, Monsieur.”\n\nThere was an awkward silence, broken at length by an exclamation from\nGaspard. Colonel Chouteau turned his back, and I saw his shoulders\nheave. All eyes were on Nick, but the rascal did not seem at all\nperturbed.\n\n“Monsieur,” he said, bowing, “marriage is a serious thing, and not to be\nentered into lightly. I thank you from my heart, but I am bound now with\nMr. Ritchie on an errand of such importance that I must make a sacrifice\nof my own interests and affairs to his.”\n\n“If Mr. Temple wishes--” I began, with malicious delight. But Nick took\nme by the shoulder.\n\n“My dear Davy,” he said, giving me a vicious kick, “I could not think of\nit. I will go with you at once. Adieu, Mademoiselle,” said he, bending\nover Suzanne’s unresisting hand. “Adieu, Messieurs, and I thank you for\nyour great interest in me.” (This to Gaspard and Hippolyte.) “And now,\nMonsieur Gratiot, I have already presumed too much on your patience. I\nwill follow you, Monsieur.”\n\nWe left them, Lenoir, Suzanne, and her two suitors, standing at the\npond, and made our way through the path in the forest. It was not until\nwe reached the road and had begun to climb out of the valley that the\nsilence was broken between us.\n\n“Monsieur,” said Colonel Chouteau, slyly, “do you have many such\nescapes?”\n\n“It might have been closer,” said Nick.\n\n“Closer?” ejaculated the Colonel.\n\n“Assuredly,” said Nick, “to the extent of abducting Monsieur le curé.\nAs for you, Davy,” he added, between his teeth, “I mean to get even with\nyou.”\n\nIt was well for us that the Colonel and Monsieur Gratiot took the\nescapade with such good nature. And so we walked along through the\nsummer night, talking gayly, until at length the lights of the village\ntwinkled ahead of us, and in the streets we met many parties making\nmerry on their homeward way. We came to Monsieur Gratiot’s, bade our\nfarewells to Madame, picked up our saddle-bags, the two gentlemen\nescorting us down to the river bank where the keel boat was tugging at\nthe ropes that held her, impatient to be off. Her captain, a picturesque\nCanadian by the name of Xavier Paret, was presented to us; we bade our\nfriends farewell, and stepped across the plank to the deck. As we were\ncasting off, Monsieur Gratiot called to us that he would take the first\noccasion to send our horses back to Kentucky. The oars were manned, the\nheavy hulk moved, and we were shot out into the mighty current of the\nriver on our way to New Orleans.\n\nNick and I stood for a long time on the deck, and the windows of the\nlittle village gleamed like stars among the trees. We passed the last of\nits houses that nestled against the hill, and below that the forest lay\nlike velvet under the moon. The song of our boatmen broke the silence of\nthe night:--\n\n “Voici le temps et la saison,\n Voici le temps et la saison,\n Ah! vrai, que les journées sont longues,\n Ah! vrai, que les journées sont longues!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. THE KEEL BOAT\n\nWe were embarked on a strange river, in a strange boat, and bound for\na strange city. To us Westerners a halo of romance, of unreality, hung\nover New Orleans. To us it had an Old World, almost Oriental flavor\nof mystery and luxury and pleasure, and we imagined it swathed in the\nmoisture of the Delta, built of quaint houses, with courts of shining\norange trees and magnolias, and surrounded by flowering plantations of\nunimagined beauty. It was most fitting that such a place should be the\nseat of dark intrigues against material progress, and this notion lent\nadded zest to my errand thither. As for Nick, it took no great sagacity\non my part to predict that he would forget Suzanne and begin to look\nforward to the Creole beauties of the Mysterious City.\n\nFirst, there was the fur-laden keel boat in which we travelled, gone\nforever now from Western navigation. It had its rude square sail to take\nadvantage of the river winds, its mast strongly braced to hold the long\ntow-ropes. But tow-ropes were for the endless up-river journey, when\na numerous crew strained day after day along the bank, chanting the\nvoyageurs’ songs. Now we were light-manned, two half-breeds and two\nCanadians to handle the oars in time of peril, and Captain Xavier, who\nstood aft on the cabin roof, leaning against the heavy beam of the long,\ncurved tiller, watching hawklike for snag and eddy and bar. Within the\ncabin was a great fireplace of stones, where our cooking was done, and\nbunks set round for the men in cold weather and rainy. But in these fair\nnights we chose to sleep on deck.\n\nFar into the night we sat, Nick and I, our feet dangling over the\nforward edge of the cabin, looking at the glory of the moon on the vast\nriver, at the endless forest crown, at the haze which hung like silver\ndust under the high bluffs on the American side. We slept. We awoke\nagain as the moon was shrinking abashed before the light that glowed\nabove these cliffs, and the river was turned from brown to gold and then\nto burnished copper, the forest to a thousand shades of green from crest\nto the banks where the river was licking the twisted roots to nakedness.\nThe south wind wafted the sharp wood-smoke from the chimney across our\nfaces. In the stern Xavier stood immovable against the tiller, his short\npipe clutched between his teeth, the colors of his new worsted belt made\ngorgeous by the rising sun.\n\n“B’jour, Michié,” he said, and added in the English he had picked up\nfrom the British traders, “the breakfas’ he is ready, and Jean make him\ngood. Will you have the grace to descen’?”\n\nWe went down the ladder into the cabin, where the odor of the furs\nmingled with the smell of the cooking. There was a fricassee steaming\non the crane, some of Zéron’s bread, brought from St. Louis, and coffee\nthat Monsieur Gratiot had provided for our use. We took our bowls and\ncups on deck and sat on the edge of the cabin.\n\n“By gad,” cried Nick, “it lacks but the one element to make it a\nparadise.”\n\n“And what is that?” I demanded.\n\n“A woman,” said he.\n\nXavier, who overheard, gave a delighted laugh.\n\n“Parbleu, Michié, you have right,” he said, “but Michié Gratiot, he say\nno. In Nouvelle Orléans we find some.”\n\nNick got to his feet, and if anything he did could have surprised me, I\nshould have been surprised when he put his arm coaxingly about Xavier’s\nneck. Xavier himself was surprised and correspondingly delighted.\n\n“Tell me, Xavier,” he said, with a look not to be resisted, “do you\nthink I shall find some beauties there?”\n\n“Beauties!” exclaimed Xavier, “La Nouvelle Orléans--it is the home of\nbeauty, Michié. They promenade themselves on the levee, they look down\nfrom ze gallerie, mais--”\n\n“But what, Xavier?”\n\n“But, mon Dieu, Michié, they are vair’ difficile. They are not like\nEnglis’ beauties, there is the father and the mother, and--the convent.”\nAnd Xavier, who had a wen under his eye, laid his finger on it.\n\n“For shame, Xavier,” cried Nick; “and you are balked by such things?”\n\nXavier thought this an exceedingly good joke, and he took his pipe out\nof his mouth to laugh the better.\n\n“Me? Mais non, Michié. And yet ze Alcalde, he mek me afraid. Once he put\nme in ze calaboose when I tried to climb ze balcon’.”\n\nNick roared.\n\n“I will show you how, Xavier,” he said; “as to climbing the balconies,\nthere is a convenance in it, as in all else. For instance, one must\nbe daring, and discreet, and nimble, and ready to give the law a\npresentable answer, and lacking that, a piastre. And then the fair one\nmust be a fair one indeed.”\n\n“Diable, Michié,” cried Xavier, “you are ze mischief.”\n\n“Nay,” said Nick, “I learned it all and much more from my cousin, Mr.\nRitchie.”\n\nXavier stared at me for an instant, and considering that he knew nothing\nof my character, I thought it extremely impolite of him to laugh.\nIndeed, he tried to control himself, for some reason standing in awe of\nmy appearance, and then he burst out into such loud haw-haws that the\ncrew poked their heads above the cabin hatch.\n\n“Michié Reetchie,” said Xavier, and again he burst into laughter that\nchoked further speech. He controlled himself and laid his finger on his\nwen.\n\n“You don’t believe it,” said Nick, offended.\n\n“Michié Reetchie a gallant!” said Xavier.\n\n“An incurable,” said Nick, “an amazingly clever rogue at device when\nthere is a petticoat in it. Davy, do I do you justice?”\n\nXavier roared again.\n\n“Quel maître!” he said.\n\n“Xavier,” said Nick, gently taking the tiller out of his hand, “I will\nteach you how to steer a keel boat.”\n\n“Mon Dieu,” said Xavier, “and who is to pay Michié Gratiot for his fur?\nThe river, she is full of things.”\n\n“Yes, I know, Xavier, but you will teach me to steer.”\n\n“Volontiers, Michié, as we go now. But there come a time when I, even I,\nwho am twenty year on her, do not know whether it is right or left. Ze\nrock--he vair’ hard. Ze snag, he grip you like dat,” and Xavier twined\nhis strong arms around Nick until he was helpless. “Ze bar--he hol’ you\nby ze leg. An’ who is to tell you how far he run under ze yellow water,\nMichié? I, who speak to you, know. But I know not how I know. Ze water,\nsometime she tell, sometime she say not’ing.”\n\n“À bas, Xavier!” said Nick, pushing him away, “I will teach you the\nriver.”\n\nXavier laughed, and sat down on the edge of the cabin. Nick took easily\nto accomplishments, and he handled the clumsy tiller with a certainty\nand distinction that made the boatmen swear in two languages and a\npatois. A great water-logged giant of the Northern forests loomed ahead\nof us. Xavier sprang to his feet, but Nick had swung his boat swiftly,\nsmoothly, into the deeper water on the outer side.\n\n“Saint Jacques, Michié,” cried Xavier, “you mek him better zan I\nthought.”\n\nFascinated by a new accomplishment, Nick held to the tiller, while\nXavier with a trained eye scanned the troubled, yellow-glistening\nsurface of the river ahead. The wind died, the sun beat down with a\nmoist and venomous sting, and northeastward above the edge of the bluff\na bank of cloud like sulphur smoke was lifted. Gradually Xavier ceased\nhis jesting and became quiet.\n\n“Looks like a hurricane,” said Nick.\n\n“Mon Dieu,” said Xavier, “you have right, Michié,” and he called in\nhis rapid patois to the crew, who lounged forward in the cabin’s shade.\nThere came to my mind the memory of that hurricane at Temple Bow long\nago, a storm that seemed to have brought so much sorrow into my life. I\nglanced at Nick, but his face was serene.\n\nThe cloud-bank came on in black and yellow masses, and the saffron light\nI recalled so well turned the living green of the forest to a sickly\npallor and the yellow river to a tinge scarce to be matched on earth.\nXavier had the tiller now, and the men were straining at the oars to\nsend the boat across the current towards the nearer western shore. And\nas my glance took in the scale of things, the miles of bluff frowning\nabove the bottom, the river that seemed now like a lake of lava gently\nboiling, and the wilderness of the western shore that reached beyond the\nken of man, I could not but shudder to think of the conflict of nature’s\nforces in such a place. A grim stillness reigned over all, broken only\nnow and again by a sharp command from Xavier. The men were rowing for\ntheir lives, the sweat glistening on their red faces.\n\n“She come,” said Xavier.\n\nI looked, not to the northeast whence the banks of cloud had risen,\nbut to the southwest, and it seemed as though a little speck was there\nagainst the hurrying film of cloud. We were drawing near the forest\nline, where a little creek made an indentation. I listened, and from\nafar came a sound like the strumming of low notes on a guitar, and sad.\nThe terrified scream of a panther broke the silence of the forest, and\nthen the other distant note grew stronger, and stronger yet, and rose to\na high hum like unto no sound on this earth, and mingled with it now\nwas a lashing like water falling from a great height. We grounded, and\nXavier, seizing a great tow-rope, leaped into the shallow water and\npassed the bight around a trunk. I cried out to Nick, but my voice was\ndrowned. He seized me and flung me under the cabin’s lee, and then above\nthe fearful note of the storm came cracklings like gunshots of great\ntrees snapping at their trunk. We saw the forest wall burst out--how far\naway I know not--and the air was filled as with a flock of giant birds,\nand boughs crashed on the roof of the cabin and tore the water in the\ndarkness. How long we lay clutching each other in terror on the rocking\nboat I may not say, but when the veil first lifted there was the river\nlike an angry sea, and limitless, the wind in its fury whipping the\nfoam from the crests and bearing it off into space. And presently, as we\nstared, the note lowered and the wind was gone again, and there was the\nwater tossing foolishly, and we lay safe amidst the green wreckage of\nthe forest as by a miracle.\n\nIt was Nick who moved first. With white face he climbed to the roof of\nthe cabin and idly seizing the great limb that lay there tried to move\nit. Xavier, who lay on his face on the bank, rose to a sitting posture\nand crossed himself. Beyond me crowded the four members of the crew,\nunhurt. Then we heard Xavier’s voice, in French, thanking the Blessed\nVirgin for our escape.\n\nFurther speech was gone from us, for men do not talk after such a\nmatter. We laid hold of the tree across the cabin and, straining, flung\nit over into the water. A great drop of rain hit me on the forehead, and\nthere came a silver-gray downpour that blotted out the scene and drove\nus down below. And then, from somewhere in the depths of the dark cabin,\ncame a sound to make a man’s blood run cold.\n\n“What’s that?” I said, clutching Nick.\n\n“Benjy,” said he; “thank God he did not die of fright.” We lighted a\ncandle, and poking around, found the negro where he had crept into the\nfarthest corner of a bunk with his face to the wall. And when we touched\nhim he gave vent to a yell that was blood-curdling.\n\n“I’se a bad nigger, Lo’d, yes, I is,” he moaned. “I ain’t fit fo’\njedgment, Lo’d.”\n\nNick shook him and laughed.\n\n“Come out of that, Benjy,” he said; “you’ve got another chance.”\n\nBenjy turned, perforce, the whites of his eyes gleaming in the\ncandle-light, and stared at us.\n\n“You ain’t gone yit, Marse,” he said.\n\n“Gone where?” said Nick.\n\n“I’se done been tole de quality ‘ll be jedged fust, Marse,” said Benjy.\n\nNick hauled him out on the floor. Climbing to the deck, we found that\nthe boat was already under way, running southward in the current through\nthe misty rain. And gazing shoreward, a sight met my eyes which I shall\nnever forget. A wide vista, carpeted with wreckage, was cut through the\nforest to the river’s edge, and the yellow water was strewn for miles\nwith green boughs. We stared down it, overwhelmed, until we had passed\nbeyond its line.\n\n“It is as straight,” said Nick, “as straight as one of her Majesty’s\nalleys I saw cut through the forest at Saint-Cloud.”\n\nHad I space and time to give a faithful account of this journey it\nwould be chiefly a tribute to Xavier’s skill, for they who have not put\nthemselves at the mercy of the Mississippi in a small craft can have no\nidea of the dangers of such a voyage. Infinite experience, a keen eye,\na steady hand, and a nerve of iron are required. Now, when the current\nswirled almost to a rapid, we grazed a rock by the width of a ripple;\nand again, despite the effort of Xavier and the crew, we would tear the\nlimbs from a huge tree, which, had we hit it fair, would have ripped us\nfrom bow to stern. Once, indeed, we were fast on a sand-bar, whence (as\nNick said) Xavier fairly cursed us off. We took care to moor at night,\nwhere we could be seen as little as possible from the river, and divided\nthe watches lest we should be surprised by Indians. And, as we went\nsouthward, our hands and faces became blotched all over by the bites of\nmosquitoes and flies, and we smothered ourselves under blankets to get\nrid of them. At times we fished, and one evening, after we had passed\nthe expanse of water at the mouth of the Ohio, Nick pulled a hideous\nthing from the inscrutable yellow depths,--a slimy, scaleless catfish.\nHe came up like a log, and must have weighed seventy pounds. Xavier and\nhis men and myself made two good meals of him, but Nick would not touch\nthe meat.\n\nThe great river teemed with life. There were flocks of herons and cranes\nand water pelicans, and I know not what other birds, and as we slipped\nunder the banks we often heard the paroquets chattering in the forests.\nAnd once, as we drifted into an inlet at sunset, we caught sight of the\nshaggy head of a bear above the brown water, and leaping down into the\ncabin I primed the rifle that stood there and shot him. It took the\nseven of us to drag him on board, and then I cleaned and skinned him as\nTom had taught me, and showed Jean how to put the caul fat and liver\nin rows on a skewer and wrap it in the bear’s handkerchief and roast it\nbefore the fire. Nick found no difficulty in eating this--it was a dish\nfit for any gourmand.\n\nWe passed the great, red Chickasaw Bluff, which sits facing westward\nlooking over the limitless Louisiana forests, where new and wondrous\nvines and flowers grew, and came to the beautiful Walnut Hills crowned\nby a Spanish fort. We did not stop there to exchange courtesies, but\npressed on to the Grand Gulf, the grave of many a keel boat before and\nsince. This was by far the most dangerous place on the Mississippi, and\nXavier was never weary of recounting many perilous escapes there, or\ntelling how such and such a priceless cargo had sunk in the mud by\nreason of the lack of skill of particular boatmen he knew of. And\nindeed, the Canadian’s face assumed a graver mien after the Walnut Hills\nwere behind us.\n\n“You laugh, Michié,” he said to Nick, a little resentfully. “I who speak\nto you say that there is four foot on each side of ze bateau. Too much\ntafia, a little too much excite--” and he made a gesture with his hand\nexpressive of total destruction; “ze tornado, I would sooner have him--”\n\n“Bah!” said Nick, stroking Xavier’s black beard, “give me the tiller.\nI will see you through safely, and we will not spare the tafia either.”\nAnd he began to sing a song of Xavier’s own:--\n\n “‘Marianson, dame jolie,\n Où est allé votre mari?’”\n\n“Ah, toujours les dames!” said Xavier. “But I tell you, Michié, le\ndiable,--he is at ze bottom of ze Grand Gulf and his mouth open--so.”\nAnd he suited the action to the word.\n\nAt night we tied up under the shore within earshot of the mutter of the\nplace, and twice that night I awoke with clinched hands from a dream\nof being spun fiercely against the rock of which Xavier had told,\nand sucked into the devil’s mouth under the water. Dawn came as I was\nfighting the mosquitoes,--a still, sultry dawn with thunder muttering in\nthe distance.\n\nWe breakfasted in silence, and with the crew standing ready at the oars\nand Xavier scanning the wide expanse of waters ahead, seeking for that\nunmarked point whence to embark on this perilous journey, we floated\ndown the stream. The prospect was sufficiently disquieting on that\nmurky day. Below us, on the one hand, a rocky bluff reached out into\nthe river, and on the far side was a timber-clad point round which the\nMississippi doubled and flowed back on itself. It needed no trained eye\nto guess at the perils of the place. On the one side the mighty current\ncharged against the bluff and, furious at the obstacle, lashed itself\ninto a hundred sucks and whirls, their course marked by the flotsam\nplundered from the forests above. Woe betide the boat that got into this\ndevil’s caldron! And on the other side, near the timbered point, ran a\ncounter current marked by forest wreckage flowing up-stream. To venture\ntoo far on this side was to be grounded or at least to be sent back to\nembark once more on the trial.\n\nBut where was the channel? We watched Xavier with bated breath. Not once\ndid he take his eyes from the swirling water ahead, but gave the tiller\na touch from time to time, now right, now left, and called in a monotone\nfor the port or starboard oars. Nearer and nearer we sped, dodging the\nsnags, until the water boiled around us, and suddenly the boat\nshot forward as in a mill-race, and we clutched the cabin’s roof.\nA triumphant gleam was in Xavier’s eyes, for he had hit the channel\nsquarely. And then, like a monster out of the deep, the scaly, black\nback of a great northern pine was flung up beside us and sheered us\nacross the channel until we were at the very edge of the foam-specked,\nspinning water. But Xavier saw it, and quick as lightning brought his\nhelm over and laughed as he heard it crunching along our keel. And so\nwe came swiftly around the bend and into safety once more. The next day\nthere was the Petite Gulf, which bothered Xavier very little, and the\nday after that we came in sight of Natchez on her heights and guided our\nboat in amongst the others that lined the shore, scowled at by lounging\nIndians there, and eyed suspiciously by a hatchet-faced Spaniard in a\ntawdry uniform who represented his Majesty’s customs. Here we stopped\nfor a day and a night that Xavier and his crew might get properly drunk\non tafia, while Nick and I walked about the town and waited until his\nExcellency, the commandant, had finished dinner that we might present\nour letters and obtain his passport. Natchez at that date was a\nsufficiently unkempt and evil place of dirty, ramshackle houses and\ngambling dens, where men of the four nations gamed and quarrelled and\nfought. We were glad enough to get away the following morning, Xavier\nsomewhat saddened by the loss of thirty livres of which he had no\nmemory, and Nick and myself relieved at having the passports in our\npockets. I have mine yet among my papers.\n\n      “Natchez, 29 de Junio, de 1789.\n\n“Concedo libre y seguro pasaporte a Don Davíd Ritchie para que pase a la\nNueva Orleans por Agna. Pido y encargo no se le ponga embarazo.”\n\nA few days more and we were running between low shores which seemed to\nhold a dark enchantment. The rivers now flowed out of, and not into the\nMississippi, and Xavier called them bayous, and often it took much skill\nand foresight on his part not to be shot into the lane they made in the\ndark forest of an evening. And the forest,--it seemed an impenetrable\nmystery, a strange tangle of fantastic growths: the live-oak (chêne\nvert), its wide-spreading limbs hung funereally with Spanish moss and\ntwined in the mistletoe’s death embrace; the dark cypress swamp with the\nconelike knees above the yellow back-waters; and here and there grew the\nbridelike magnolia which we had known in Kentucky, wafting its perfume\nover the waters, and wondrous flowers and vines and trees with French\nnames that bring back the scene to me even now with a whiff of romance,\nbois d’arc, lilac, grande volaille (water-lily). Birds flew hither and\nthither (the names of every one of which Xavier knew),--the whistling\npapabot, the mournful bittern (garde-soleil), and the night-heron\n(grosbeck), who stood like a sentinel on the points.\n\nOne night I awoke with the sweat starting from my brow, trying to\ncollect my senses, and I lay on my blanket listening to such plaintive\nand heart-rending cries as I had never known. Human cries they were,\ncries as of children in distress, and I rose to a sitting posture on the\ndeck with my hair standing up straight, to discover Nick beside me in\nthe same position.\n\n“God have mercy on us,” I heard him mutter, “what’s that? It sounds like\nthe wail of all the babies since the world began.”\n\nWe listened together, and I can give no notion of the hideous\nmournfulness of the sound. We lay in a swampy little inlet, and the\nforest wall made a dark blur against the star-studded sky. There was a\nsplash near the boat that made me clutch my legs, the wails ceased and\nbegan again with redoubled intensity. Nick and I leaped to our feet\nand stood staring, horrified, over the gunwale into the black water.\nPresently there was a laugh behind us, and we saw Xavier resting on his\nelbow.\n\n“What devil-haunted place is this?” demanded Nick.\n\n“Ha, ha,” said Xavier, shaking with unseemly mirth, “you have never\nheard ze alligator sing, Michié?”\n\n“Alligator!” cried Nick; “there are babies in the water, I tell you.”\n\n“Ha, ha,” laughed Xavier, flinging off his blanket and searching for his\nflint and tinder. He lighted a pine knot, and in the red pulsing flare\nwe saw what seemed to be a dozen black logs floating on the surface.\nAnd then Xavier flung the cresset at them, fire and all. There was a\nlashing, a frightful howl from one of the logs, and the night’s silence\nonce more.\n\nOften after that our slumbers were disturbed, and we would rise\nwith maledictions in our mouths to fling the handiest thing at the\nserenaders. When we arose in the morning we would often see them by the\ndozens, basking in the shallows, with their wide mouths flapped open\nwaiting for their prey. Sometimes we ran upon them in the water, where\nthey looked like the rough-bark pine logs from the North, and Nick\nwould have a shot at them. When he hit one fairly there would be a\nleviathan-like roar and a churning of the river into suds.\n\nAt length there were signs that we were drifting out of the wilderness,\nand one morning we came in sight of a rich plantation with its dark\norange trees and fields of indigo, with its wide-galleried manor-house\nin a grove. And as we drifted we heard the negroes chanting at their\nwork, the plaintive cadence of the strange song adding to the mystery\nof the scene. Here in truth was a new world, a land of peaceful customs,\ngreen and moist. The soft-toned bells of it seemed an expression of its\nlife,--so far removed from our own striving and fighting existence in\nKentucky. Here and there, between plantations, a belfry could be seen\nabove the cluster of the little white village planted in the green; and\nwhen we went ashore amongst these simple French people they treated us\nwith such gentle civility and kindness that we would fain have lingered\nthere. The river had become a vast yellow lake, and often as we drifted\nof an evening the wail of a slave dance and monotonous beating of a\ntom-tom would float to us over the water.\n\nAt last, late one afternoon, we came in sight of that strange city which\nhad filled our thoughts for many days.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. THE STRANGE CITY\n\n\nNick and I stood by the mast on the forward part of the cabin, staring\nat the distant, low-lying city, while Xavier sought for the entrance\nto the eddy which here runs along the shore. If you did not gain this\nentrance,--so he explained,--you were carried by a swift current below\nNew Orleans and might by no means get back save by the hiring of a\ncrew. Xavier, however, was not to be caught thus, and presently we were\ngliding quietly along the eastern bank, or levee, which held back\nthe river from the lowlands. Then, as we looked, the levee became an\nesplanade shaded by rows of willows, and through them we caught sight\nof the upper galleries and low, curving roofs of the city itself. There,\ncried Xavier, was the Governor’s house on the corner, where the great\nMiro lived, and beyond it the house of the Intendant; and then, gliding\ninto an open space between the keel boats along the bank, stared at by\na score of boatmen and idlers from above, we came to the end of our long\njourney. No sooner had we made fast than we were boarded by a shabby\ncustoms officer who, when he had seen our passports, bowed politely and\ninvited us to land. We leaped ashore, gained the gravelled walk on the\nlevee, and looked about us.\n\nSqualidity first met our eyes. Below us, crowded between the levee\nand the row of houses, were dozens of squalid market-stalls tended by\ncotton-clad negroes. Beyond, across the bare Place d’Armes, a blackened\ngap in the line of houses bore witness to the devastation of the year\ngone by, while here and there a roof, struck by the setting sun, gleamed\nfiery red with its new tiles. The levee was deserted save for the\nnegroes and the river men.\n\n“Time for siesta, Michié,” said Xavier, joining us; “I will show you ze\ninn of which I spik. She is kep’ by my fren’, Madame Bouvet.”\n\n“Xavier,” said Nick, looking at the rolling flood of the river, “suppose\nthis levee should break?”\n\n“Ah,” said Xavier, “then some Spaniard who never have a bath--he feel\nwhat water is lak.”\n\nFollowed by Benjy with the saddle-bags, we went down the steps set in\nthe levee into this strange, foreign city. It was like unto nothing\nwe had ever seen, nor can I give an adequate notion of how it affected\nus,--such a mixture it seemed of dirt and poverty and wealth and\nromance. The narrow, muddy streets ran with filth, and on each side\nalong the houses was a sun-baked walk held up by the curved sides of\nbroken flatboats, where two men might scarcely pass. The houses, too,\nhad an odd and foreign look, some of wood, some of upright logs and\nplaster, and newer ones, Spanish in style, of adobe, with curving roofs\nof red tiles and strong eaves spreading over the banquette (as the\nsidewalk was called), casting shadows on lemon-colored walls. Since New\nOrleans was in a swamp, the older houses for the most part were lifted\nsome seven feet above the ground, and many of these houses had wide\ngalleries on the street side. Here and there a shop was set in the wall;\na watchmaker was to be seen poring over his work at a tiny window, a\nshoemaker cross-legged on the floor. Again, at an open wicket, we caught\na glimpse through a cool archway into a flowering court-yard. Stalwart\nnegresses with bright kerchiefs made way for us on the banquette. Hands\non hips, they swung along erect, with baskets of cakes and sweetmeats on\ntheir heads, musically crying their wares.\n\nAt length, turning a corner, we came to a white wooden house on the Rue\nRoyale, with a flight of steps leading up to the entrance. In place of\na door a flimsy curtain hung in the doorway, and, pushing this aside,\nwe followed Xavier through a darkened hall to a wide gallery that\noverlooked a court-yard. This court-yard was shaded by several great\ntrees which grew there; the house and gallery ran down one other side of\nit; and the two remaining sides were made up of a series of low cabins,\nthese forming the various outhouses and the kitchen. At the far end\nof this gallery a sallow, buxom lady sat sewing at a table, and Xavier\nsaluted her very respectfully.\n\n“Madame,” he said, “I have brought you from St. Louis with Michié\nGratiot’s compliments two young American gentlemen, who are travelling\nto amuse themselves.”\n\nThe lady rose and beamed upon us.\n\n“From Monsieur Gratiot,” she said; “you are very welcome, gentlemen, to\nsuch poor accommodations as I have. It is not unusual to have American\ngentlemen in New Orleans, for many come here first and last. And I am\nhappy to say that two of my best rooms are vacant. Zoey!”\n\nThere was a shrill answer from the court below, and a negro girl in a\nyellow turban came running up, while Madame Bouvet bustled along the\ngallery and opened the doors of two darkened rooms. Within I could dimly\nsee a walnut dresser, a chair, and a walnut bed on which was spread a\nmosquito bar.\n\n“Voilá! Messieurs,” cried Madame Bouvet, “there is still a little\ntime for a siesta. No siesta!” cried Madame, eying us aghast; “ah, the\nAmericans they never rest--never.”\n\nWe bade farewell to the good Xavier, promising to see him soon; and\nNick, shouting to Benjy to open the saddle-bags, proceeded to array\nhimself in the clothes which had made so much havoc at St. Louis. I\nboded no good from this proceeding, but I reflected, as I watched him\ndress, that I might as well try to turn the Mississippi from its course\nas to attempt to keep my cousin from the search for gallant adventure.\nAnd I reflected that his indulgence in pleasure-seeking would serve\nthe more to divert any suspicions which might fall upon my own head. At\nlast, when the setting sun was flooding the court-yard, he stood arrayed\nupon the gallery, ready to venture forth to conquest.\n\nMadame Bouvet’s tavern, or hotel, or whatever she was pleased to call\nit, was not immaculately clean. Before passing into the street we stood\nfor a moment looking into the public room on the left of the hallway,\na long saloon, evidently used in the early afternoon for a dining room,\nand at the back of it a wide, many-paned window, capped by a Spanish\narch, looked out on the gallery. Near this window was a gay party of\nyoung men engaged at cards, waited on by the yellow-turbaned Zoey, and\ndrinking what evidently was claret punch. The sounds of their jests and\nlaughter pursued us out of the house.\n\nThe town was waking from its siesta, the streets filling, and people\nstopped to stare at Nick as we passed. But Nick, who was plainly in\nsearch of something he did not find, hurried on. We soon came to the\nquarter which had suffered most from the fire, where new houses had\ngone up or were in the building beside the blackened logs of many of\nBienville’s time. Then we came to a high white wall that surrounded a\nlarge garden, and within it was a long, massive building of some beauty\nand pretension, with a high, latticed belfry and heavy walls and with\narched dormers in the sloping roof. As we stood staring at it through\nthe iron grille set in the archway of the lodge, Nick declared that it\nput him in mind of some of the châteaux he had seen in France, and he\ncrossed the street to get a better view of the premises. An old man in\ncoarse blue linen came out of the lodge and spoke to me.\n\n“It is the convent of the good nuns, the Ursulines, Monsieur,” he said\nin French, “and it was built long ago in the Sieur de Bienville’s time,\nwhen the colony was young. For forty-five years, Monsieur, the young\nladies of the city have come here to be educated.”\n\n“What does he say?” demanded Nick, pricking up his ears as he came\nacross the street.\n\n“That young men have been sent to the mines of Brazil for climbing the\nwalls,” I answered.\n\n“Who wants to climb the walls?” said Nick, disgusted.\n\n“The young ladies of the town go to school here,” I answered; “it is a\nconvent.”\n\n“It might serve to pass the time,” said Nick, gazing with a new interest\nat the latticed windows. “How much would you take, my friend, to let us\nin at the back way this evening?” he demanded of the porter in French.\n\nThe good man gasped, lifted his hands in horror, and straightway let\nloose upon Nick a torrent of French invectives that had not the least\neffect except to cause a blacksmith’s apprentice and two negroes to stop\nand stare at us.\n\n“Pooh!” exclaimed Nick, when the man had paused for want of breath, “it\nis no trick to get over that wall.”\n\n“Bon Dieu!” cried the porter, “you are Kentuckians, yes? I might have\nknown that you were Kentuckians, and I shall advise the good sisters to\nput glass on the wall and keep a watch.”\n\n“The young ladies are beautiful, you say?” said Nick.\n\nAt this juncture, with the negroes grinning and the porter near bursting\nwith rage, there came out of the lodge the fattest woman I have ever\nseen for her size. She seized her husband by the back of his loose frock\nand pulled him away, crying out that he was losing time by talking to\nvagabonds, besides disturbing the good sisters. Then we went away, Nick\nfollowing the convent wall down to the river. Turning southward under\nthe bank past the huddle of market-stalls, we came suddenly upon a sight\nthat made us pause and wonder.\n\nNew Orleans was awake. A gay and laughing throng paced the esplanade on\nthe levee under the willows, with here and there a cavalier on horseback\non the Royal Road below. Across the Place d’Armes the spire of the\nparish church stood against the fading sky, and to the westward the\nmighty river stretched away like a gilded floor. It was a strange\nthrong. There were grave Spaniards in long cloaks and feathered beavers;\njolly merchants and artisans in short linen jackets, each with his\ntabatière, the wives with bits of finery, the children laughing and\nshouting and dodging in and out between fathers and mothers beaming with\nquiet pride and contentment; swarthy boat-men with their worsted belts,\ngaudy negresses chanting in the soft patois, and here and there a\nblanketed Indian. Nor was this all. Some occasion (so Madame Bouvet had\ntold us) had brought a sprinkling of fashion to town that day, and it\nwas a fashion to astonish me. There were fine gentlemen with swords\nand silk waistcoats and silver shoe-buckles, and ladies in filmy summer\ngowns. Greuze ruled the mode in France then, but New Orleans had not\ngot beyond Watteau. As for Nick and me, we knew nothing of Greuze and\nWatteau then, and we could only stare in astonishment. And for once we\nsaw an officer of the Louisiana Regiment resplendent in a uniform that\nmight have served at court.\n\nAy, and there was yet another sort. Every flatboatman who returned to\nKentucky was full of tales of the marvellous beauty of the quadroons and\noctoroons, stories which I had taken with a grain of salt; but they had\nnot indeed been greatly overdrawn. For here were these ladies in the\nflesh, their great, opaque, almond eyes consuming us with a swift\nglance, and each walking with a languid grace beside her duenna. Their\nfaces were like old ivory, their dress the stern Miro himself could\nscarce repress. In former times they had been lavish in their finery,\nand even now earrings still gleamed and color broke out irrepressibly.\n\nNick was delighted, but he had not dragged me twice the length of the\nesplanade ere his eye was caught by a young lady in pink who sauntered\nbetween an elderly gentleman in black silk and a young man more gayly\ndressed.\n\n“Egad,” said Nick, “there is my divinity, and I need not look a step\nfarther.”\n\nI laughed.\n\n“You have but to choose, I suppose, and all falls your way,” I answered.\n\n“But look!” he cried, halting me to stare after the girl, “what a face,\nand what a form! And what a carriage, by Jove! There is breeding for\nyou! And Davy, did you mark the gentle, rounded arm? Thank heaven these\nshort sleeves are the fashion.”\n\n“You are mad, Nick,” I answered, pulling him on, “these people are\nnot to be stared at so. And once I present our letters to Monsieur de\nSaint-Gré, it will not be difficult to know any of them.”\n\n“Look!” said he, “that young man, lover or husband, is a brute. On my\nsoul, they are quarrelling.”\n\nThe three had stopped by a bench under a tree. The young man, who wore\nclaret silk and a sword, had one of those thin faces of dirty complexion\nwhich show the ravages of dissipation, and he was talking with a\nrapidity and vehemence of which only a Latin tongue will admit. We\ncould see, likewise, that the girl was answering with spirit,--indeed, I\nshould write a stronger word than spirit,--while the elderly gentleman,\nwho had a good-humored, fleshy face and figure, was plainly doing his\nbest to calm them both. People who were passing stared curiously at the\nthree.\n\n“Your divinity evidently has a temper,” I remarked.\n\n“For that scoundel--certainly,” said Nick; “but come, they are moving\non.”\n\n“You mean to follow them?” I exclaimed.\n\n“Why not?” said he. “We will find out where they live and who they are,\nat least.”\n\n“And you have taken a fancy to this girl?”\n\n“I have looked them all over, and she’s by far the best I’ve seen. I can\nsay so much honestly.”\n\n“But she may be married,” I said weakly.\n\n“Tut, Davy,” he answered, “it’s more than likely, from the violence of\ntheir quarrel. But if so, we will try again.”\n\n“We!” I exclaimed.\n\n“Oh, come on!” he cried, dragging me by the sleeve, “or we shall lose\nthem.”\n\nI resisted no longer, but followed him down the levee, in my heart\nthanking heaven that he had not taken a fancy to an octoroon. Twilight\nhad set in strongly, the gay crowd was beginning to disperse, and in\nthe distance the three figures could be seen making their way across the\nPlace d’Armes, the girl hanging on the elderly gentleman’s arm, and the\nyoung man following with seeming sullenness behind. They turned into one\nof the narrower streets, and we quickened our steps. Lights gleamed in\nthe houses; voices and laughter, and once the tinkle of a guitar came\nto us from court-yard and gallery. But Nick, hurrying on, came near to\nbowling more than one respectable citizen we met on the banquette, into\nthe ditch. We reached a corner, and the three were nowhere to be seen.\n\n“Curse the luck!” cried Nick, “we have lost them. The next time I’ll\nstop for no explanations.”\n\nThere was no particular reason why I should have been penitent, but I\nventured to say that the house they had entered could not be far off.\n\n“And how the devil are we to know it?” demanded Nick.\n\nThis puzzled me for a moment, but presently I began to think that the\ntwo might begin quarrelling again, and said so. Nick laughed and put his\narm around my neck.\n\n“You have no mean ability for intrigue when you put your mind to\nit, Davy,” he said; “I vow I believe you are in love with the girl\nyourself.”\n\nI disclaimed this with some vehemence. Indeed, I had scarcely seen her.\n\n“They can’t be far off,” said Nick; “we’ll pitch on a likely house and\ncamp in front of it until bedtime.”\n\n“And be flung into a filthy calaboose by a constable,” said I. “No,\nthank you.”\n\nWe walked on, and halfway down the block we came upon a new house with\nmore pretensions than its neighbors. It was set back a little from the\nstreet, and there was a high adobe wall into which a pair of gates were\nset, and a wicket opening in one of them. Over the wall hung a dark\nfringe of magnolia and orange boughs. On each of the gate-posts a\ncrouching lion was outlined dimly against the fainting light, and, by\ncrossing the street, we could see the upper line of a latticed gallery\nunder the low roof. We took our stand within the empty doorway of a\nblackened house, nearly opposite, and there we waited, Nick murmuring\nall sorts of ridiculous things in my ear. But presently I began to\nreflect upon the consequences of being taken in such a situation by a\nconstable and dragged into the light of a public examination. I put this\nto Nick as plainly as I could, and was declaring my intention of going\nback to Madame Bouvet’s, when the sound of voices arrested me. The\nvoices came from the latticed gallery, and they were low at first, but\nsoon rose to such an angry pitch that I made no doubt we had hit on\nthe right house after all. What they said was lost to us, but I could\ndistinguish the woman’s voice, low-pitched and vibrant as though\ninsisting upon a refusal, and the man’s scarce adult tones, now high as\nthough with balked passion, now shaken and imploring. I was for leaving\nthe place at once, but Nick clutched my arm tightly; and suddenly, as I\nstood undecided, the voices ceased entirely, there were the sounds of a\nscuffle, and the lattice of the gallery was flung open. In the all but\ndarkness we saw a figure climb over the railing, hang suspended for an\ninstant, and drop lightly to the ground. Then came the light relief of a\nwoman’s gown in the opening of the lattice, the cry “Auguste, Auguste!”\n the wicket in the gate opened and slammed, and a man ran at top speed\nalong the banquette towards the levee.\n\nInstinctively I seized Nick by the arm as he started out of the doorway.\n\n“Let me go,” he cried angrily, “let me go, Davy.”\n\nBut I held on.\n\n“Are you mad?” I said.\n\nHe did not answer, but twisted and struggled, and before I knew what he\nwas doing he had pushed me off the stone step into a tangle of blackened\nbeams behind. I dropped his arm to save myself, and it was mere good\nfortune that I did not break an ankle in the fall. When I had gained\nthe step again he was gone after the man, and a portly citizen stood in\nfront of me, looking into the doorway.\n\n“Qu’est-ce-qu’il-y-a la dedans?” he demanded sharply.\n\nIt was a sufficiently embarrassing situation. I put on a bold front,\nhowever, and not deigning to answer, pushed past him and walked with as\nmuch leisure as possible along the banquette in the direction which Nick\nhad taken. As I turned the corner I glanced over my shoulder, and in the\ndarkness I could just make out the man standing where I had left him.\nIn great uneasiness I pursued my way, my imagination summing up for Nick\nall kinds of adventures with disagreeable consequences. I walked for\nsome time--it may have been half an hour--aimlessly, and finally decided\nit would be best to go back to Madame Bouvet’s and await the issue with\nas much calmness as possible. He might not, after all, have caught the\nfellow.\n\nThere were few people in the dark streets, but at length I met a man who\ngave me directions, and presently found my way back to my lodging place.\nTalk and laughter floated through the latticed windows into the street,\nand when I had pushed back the curtain and looked into the saloon\nI found the same gaming party at the end of it, sitting in their\nshirt-sleeves amidst the moths and insects that hovered around the\ncandles.\n\n“Ah, Monsieur,” said Madame Bouvet’s voice behind me, “you must excuse\nthem. They will come here and play, the young gentlemen, and I cannot\nfind it in my heart to drive them away, though sometimes I lose a\nrespectable lodger by their noise. But, after all, what would you?” she\nadded with a shrug; “I love them, the young men. But, Monsieur,” she\ncried, “you have had no supper! And where is Monsieur your companion?\nComme il est beau garçon!”\n\n“He will be in presently,” I answered with unwarranted assumption.\n\nMadame shot at me the swiftest of glances and laughed, and I suspected\nthat she divined Nick’s propensity for adventure. However, she said\nnothing more than to bid me sit down at the table, and presently Zoey\ncame in with lights and strange, highly seasoned dishes, which I ate\nwith avidity, notwithstanding my uneasiness of mind, watching the while\nthe party at the far end of the room. There were five young gentlemen\nplaying a game I knew not, with intervals of intense silence, and\nboisterous laughter and execrations while the cards were being shuffled\nand the money rang on the board and glasses were being filled from a\nstand at one side. Presently Madame Bouvet returned, and placing before\nme a cup of wondrous coffee, advanced down the room towards them.\n\n“Ah, Messieurs,” she cried, “you will ruin my poor house.”\n\nThe five rose and bowed with marked profundity. One of them, with a\npuffy, weak, good-natured face, answered her briskly, and after a little\nraillery she came back to me. I had a question not over discreet on my\ntongue’s tip.\n\n“There are some fine residences going up here, Madame,” I said.\n\n“Since the fire, Monsieur, the dreadful fire of Good Friday a year ago.\nYou admire them?”\n\n“I saw one,” I answered with indifference, “with a wall and lions on the\ngate-posts--”\n\n“Mon Dieu, that is a house,” exclaimed Madame; “it belongs to Monsieur\nde Saint-Gré.”\n\n“To Monsieur de Saint-Gré!” I repeated.\n\nShe shot a look at me. She had bright little eyes like a bird’s, that\nshone in the candlelight.\n\n“You know him, Monsieur?”\n\n“I heard of him in St. Louis,” I answered.\n\n“You will meet him, no doubt,” she continued. “He is a very fine\ngentleman. His grandfather was Commissary-general of the colony, and he\nhimself is a cousin of the Marquis de Saint-Gré, who has two châteaux, a\nhouse in Paris, and is a favorite of the King.” She paused, as if to let\nthis impress itself upon me, and added archly, “Tenez, Monsieur, there\nis a daughter--”\n\nShe stopped abruptly.\n\nI followed her glance, and my first impression--of claret-color--gave\nme a shock. My second confirmed it, for in the semi-darkness beyond\nthe rays of the candle was a thin, eager face, prematurely lined, with\ncoal-black, lustrous eyes that spoke eloquently of indulgence. In an\ninstant I knew it to be that of the young man whom I had seen on the\nlevee.\n\n“Monsieur Auguste?” stammered Madame.\n\n“Bon soir, Madame,” he cried gayly, with a bow; “diable, they are\nalready at it, I see, and the punch in the bowl. I will win back\nto-night what I have lost by a week of accursed luck.”\n\n“Monsieur your father has relented, perhaps,” said Madame,\ndeferentially.\n\n“Relented!” cried the young man, “not a sou. C’est égal! I have the\nmeans here,” and he tapped his pocket, “I have the means here to set me\non my feet again, Madame.”\n\nHe spoke with a note of triumph, and Madame took a curious step towards\nhim.\n\n“Qu’est-ce-que c’est, Monsieur Auguste?” she inquired.\n\nHe drew something that glittered from his pocket and beckoned to her to\nfollow him down the room, which she did with alacrity.\n\n“Ha, Adolphe,” he cried to the young man of the puffy face, “I will have\nmy revenge to-night. Voilà!” and he held up the shining thing, “this\ngoes to the highest bidder, and you will agree that it is worth a pretty\nsum.”\n\nThey rose from their chairs and clustered around him at the table,\nMadame in their midst, staring with bent heads at the trinket which he\nheld to the light. It was Madame’s voice I heard first, in a kind of\nfrightened cry.\n\n“Mon Dieu, Monsieur Auguste, you will not part with that!” she\nexclaimed.\n\n“Why not?” demanded the young man, indifferently. “It was painted by\nBoze, the back is solid gold, and the Jew in the Rue Toulouse will give\nme four hundred livres for it to-morrow morning.”\n\nThere followed immediately such a chorus of questions, exclamations,\nand shrill protests from Madame Bouvet, that I (being such a laborious\nFrench scholar) could distinguish but little of what they said. I looked\nin wonderment at the gesticulating figures grouped against the light,\nMadame imploring, the youthful profile of the newcomer marked with a\ncynical and scornful refusal. More than once I was for rising out of\nmy chair to go over and see for myself what the object was, and then,\nsuddenly, I perceived Madame Bouvet coming towards me in evident\nagitation. She sank into the chair beside me.\n\n“If I had four hundred livres,” she said, “if I had four hundred\nlivres!”\n\n“And what then?” I asked.\n\n“Monsieur,” she said, “a terrible thing has happened. Auguste de\nSaint-Gré--”\n\n“Auguste de Saint-Gré!” I exclaimed.\n\n“He is the son of that Monsieur de Saint-Gré of whom we spoke,” she\nanswered, “a wild lad, a spendthrift, a gambler, if you like. And yet he\nis a Saint-Gré, Monsieur, and I cannot refuse him. It is the miniature\nof Mademoiselle Hélène de Saint-Gré, the daughter of the Marquis, sent\nto Mamselle ‘Toinette, his sister, from France. How he has obtained it I\nknow not.”\n\n“Ah!” I exclaimed sharply, the explanation of the scene of which I had\nbeen a witness coming to me swiftly. The rascal had wrenched it from her\nin the gallery and fled.\n\n“Monsieur,” continued Madame, too excited to notice my interruption,\n“if I had four hundred livres I would buy it of him, and Monsieur de\nSaint-Gré père would willingly pay it back in the morning.”\n\nI reflected. I had a letter in my pocket to Monsieur de Saint-Gré, the\nsum was not large, and the act of Monsieur Auguste de Saint-Gré in every\nlight was detestable. A rising anger decided me, and I took a wallet\nfrom my pocket.\n\n“I will buy the miniature, Madame,” I said.\n\nShe looked at me in astonishment.\n\n“God bless you, Monsieur,” she cried; “if you could see Mamselle\n‘Toinette you would pay twice the sum. The whole town loves her.\nMonsieur Auguste, Monsieur Auguste!” she shouted, “here is a gentleman\nwho will buy your miniature.”\n\nThe six young men stopped talking and stared at me with one accord.\nMadame arose, and I followed her down the room towards them, and, had it\nnot been for my indignation, I should have felt sufficiently ridiculous.\nYoung Monsieur de Saint-Gré came forward with the good-natured, easy\ninsolence to which he had been born, and looked me over.\n\n“Monsieur is an American,” he said.\n\n“I understand that you have offered this miniature for four hundred\nlivres,” I said.\n\n“It is the Jew’s price,” he answered; “mais pardieu, what will you?” he\nadded with a shrug, “I must have the money. Regardez, Monsieur, you have\na bargain. Here is Mademoiselle Hélène de Saint-Gré, daughter of my lord\nthe Marquis of whom I have the honor to be a cousin,” and he made a bow.\n“It is by the famous court painter, Joseph Boze, and Mademoiselle de\nSaint-Gré herself is a favorite of her Majesty.” He held the portrait\nclose to the candle and regarded it critically. “Mademoiselle Hélène\nVictoire Marie de Saint-Gré, painted in a costume of Henry the Second’s\ntime, with a ruff, you notice, which she wore at a ball given by his\nHighness the Prince of Condé at Chantilly. A trifle haughty, if you\nlike, Monsieur, but I venture to say you will be hopelessly in love with\nher within the hour.”\n\nAt this there was a general titter from the young gentlemen at the\ntable.\n\n“All of which is neither here nor there, Monsieur,” I answered sharply.\n“The question is purely a commercial one, and has nothing to do with the\nlady’s character or position.”\n\n“It is well said, Monsieur,” Madame Bouvet put in.\n\nMonsieur Auguste de Saint-Gré shrugged his slim shoulders and laid down\nthe portrait on the walnut table.\n\n“Four hundred livres, Monsieur,” he said.\n\nI counted out the money, scrutinized by the curious eyes of his\ncompanions, and pushed it over to him. He bowed carelessly, sat him\ndown, and began to shuffle the cards, while I picked up the miniature\nand walked out of the room. Before I had gone twenty paces I heard them\nlaughing at their game and shouting out the stakes. Suddenly I bethought\nmyself of Nick. What if he should come in and discover the party at the\ntable? I stopped short in the hallway, and there Madame Bouvet overtook\nme.\n\n“How can I thank you, Monsieur?” she said. And then, “You will return\nthe portrait to Monsieur de Saint-Gré?”\n\n“I have a letter from Monsieur Gratiot to that gentleman, which I shall\ndeliver in the morning,” I answered. “And now, Madame, I have a favor to\nask of you.”\n\n“I am at Monsieur’s service,” she answered simply.\n\n“When Mr. Temple comes in, he is not to go into that room,” I said,\npointing to the door of the saloon; “I have my reasons for requesting\nit.”\n\nFor answer Madame went to the door, closed it, and turned the key. Then\nshe sat down beside a little table with a candlestick and took up her\nknitting.\n\n“It will be as Monsieur says,” she answered.\n\nI smiled.\n\n“And when Mr. Temple comes in will you kindly say that I am waiting for\nhim in his room?” I asked.\n\n“As Monsieur says,” she answered. “I wish Monsieur a good-night and\npleasant dreams.”\n\nShe took a candlestick from the table, lighted the candle, and handed it\nme with a courtesy. I bowed, and made my way along the gallery above the\ndeserted court-yard. Entering my room and closing the door after me, I\ndrew the miniature from my pocket and stood gazing at it for I know not\nhow long.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. LES ILES\n\nI stood staring at the portrait, I say, with a kind of fascination that\nastonished me, seeing that it had come to me in such a way. It was no\nFrench face of my imagination, and as I looked it seemed to me that I\nknew Mademoiselle Hélène de Saint-Gré. And yet I smile as I write this,\nrealizing full well that my strange and foreign surroundings and my\nunforeseen adventure had much to do with my state of mind. The lady in\nthe miniature might have been eighteen, or thirty-five. Her features\nwere of the clearest cut, the nose the least trifle aquiline, and by a\nblurred outline the painter had given to the black hair piled high upon\nthe head a suggestion of waviness. The eyebrows were straight, the brown\neyes looked at the world with an almost scornful sense of humor, and I\nmarked that there was determination in the chin. Here was a face that\ncould be infinitely haughty or infinitely tender, a mouth of witty--nay,\nperhaps cutting--repartee of brevity and force. A lady who spoke\nquickly, moved quickly, or reposed absolutely. A person who commanded\nby nature and yet (dare I venture the thought?) was capable of a supreme\nsurrender. I was aroused from this odd revery by footsteps on the\ngallery, and Nick burst into the room. Without pausing to look about\nhim, he flung himself lengthwise on the bed on top of the mosquito bar.\n\n“A thousand curses on such a place,” he cried; “it is full of rat holes\nand rabbit warrens.”\n\n“Did you catch your man?” I asked innocently.\n\n“Catch him!” said Nick, with a little excusable profanity; “he went in\nat one end of such a warren and came out at another. I waited for him\nin two streets until an officious person chanced along and threatened to\ntake me before the Alcalde. What the devil is that you have got in your\nhand, Davy?” he demanded, raising his head.\n\n“A miniature that took my fancy, and which I bought.”\n\nHe rose from the bed, yawned, and taking it in his hand, held it to the\nlight. I watched him curiously.\n\n“Lord,” he said, “it is such a passion as I might have suspected of you,\nDavy.”\n\n“There was nothing said about passion,” I answered hotly.\n\n“Then why the deuce did you buy it?” he said with some pertinence.\n\nThis staggered me.\n\n“A man may fancy a thing, without indulging in a passion, I suppose,” I\nreplied.\n\nNick held the picture at arm’s length in the palm of his hand and\nregarded it critically.\n\n“Faith,” said he, “you may thank heaven it is only a picture. If such\na one ever got hold of you, Davy, she would general you even as you\ngeneral me. Egad,” he added with a laugh, “there would be no more\nwalking the streets at night in search of adventure for you. Consider\ncarefully the masterful features of that lady and thank God you haven’t\ngot her.”\n\nI was inclined to be angry, but ended by laughing.\n\n“There will be no rivalry between us, at least,” I said.\n\n“Rivalry!” exclaimed Nick. “Heaven forbid that I should aspire to such\nabject slavery. When I marry, it will be to command.”\n\n“All the more honor in such a conquest,” I suggested.\n\n“Davy,” said he, “I have long been looking for some such flaw in your\ninsuperable wisdom. But I vow I can keep my eyes open no longer. Benjy!”\n\nA smothered response came from the other side of the wall, and Benjy\nduly appeared in the doorway, blinking at the candlelight, to put his\nmaster to bed.\n\nWe slept that night with no bed covering save the mosquito bar, as was\nthe custom in New Orleans. Indeed, the heat was most oppressive, but we\nhad become to some extent inured to it on the boat, and we were both\nin such sound health that our slumbers were not disturbed. Early in the\nmorning, however, I was awakened by a negro song from the court-yard,\nand I lay pleasantly for some minutes listening to the early sounds,\nbreathing in the aroma of coffee which mingled with the odor of the\nflowers of the court, until Zoey herself appeared in the doorway,\nholding a cup in her hand. I arose, and taking the miniature from the\ntable, gazed at it in the yellow morning light; and then, having dressed\nmyself, I put it carefully in my pocket and sat down at my portfolio to\ncompose a letter to Polly Ann, knowing that a description of what I\nhad seen in New Orleans would amuse her. This done, I went out into the\ngallery, where Madame was already seated at her knitting, in the shade\nof the great tree that stood in the corner of the court and spread its\nbranches over the eaves. She arose and courtesied, with a questioning\nsmile.\n\n“Madame,” I asked, “is it too early to present myself to Monsieur de\nSaint-Gré?”\n\n“Pardieu, no, Monsieur, we are early risers in the South for we have our\nsiesta. You are going to return the portrait, Monsieur?”\n\nI nodded.\n\n“God bless you for the deed,” said she. “Tenez, Monsieur,” she added,\nstepping closer to me, “you will tell his father that you bought it from\nMonsieur Auguste?”\n\nI saw that she had a soft spot in her heart for the rogue.\n\n“I will make no promises, Madame,” I answered.\n\nShe looked at me timidly, appealingly, but I bowed and departed. The sun\nwas riding up into the sky, the walls already glowing with his heat, and\na midsummer languor seemed to pervade the streets as I walked along. The\nshadows now were sharply defined, the checkered foliage of the trees\nwas flung in black against the yellow-white wall of the house with the\nlions, and the green-latticed gallery which we had watched the night\nbefore seemed silent and deserted. I knocked at the gate, and presently\na bright-turbaned gardienne opened it.\n\nWas Monsieur de Saint-Gré at home. The gardienne looked me over, and\nevidently finding me respectable, replied with many protestations of\nsorrow that he was not, that he had gone with Mamselle very early that\nmorning to his country place at Les Îles. This information I extracted\nwith difficulty, for I was not by any means versed in the negro patois.\n\nAs I walked back to Madame Bouvet’s I made up my mind that there was\nbut the one thing to do, to go at once to Monsieur de Saint-Gré’s\nplantation. Finding Madame still waiting in the gallery, I asked her to\ndirect me thither.\n\n“You have but to follow the road that runs southward along the levee,\nand some three leagues will bring you to it, Monsieur. You will inquire\nfor Monsieur de Saint-Gré.”\n\n“Can you direct me to Mr. Daniel Clark’s?” I asked.\n\n“The American merchant and banker, the friend and associate of the\ngreat General Wilkinson whom you sent down to us last year? Certainly,\nMonsieur. He will no doubt give you better advice than I on this\nmatter.”\n\nI found Mr. Clark in his counting-room, and I had not talked with\nhim five minutes before I began to suspect that, if a treasonable\nunderstanding existed between Wilkinson and the Spanish government, Mr.\nClark was innocent of it. He being the only prominent American in the\nplace, it was natural that Wilkinson should have formed with him a\nbusiness arrangement to care for the cargoes he sent down. Indeed, after\nwe had sat for some time chatting together, Mr. Clark began himself to\nmake guarded inquiries on this very subject. Did I know Wilkinson? How\nwas his enterprise of selling Kentucky products regarded at home? But\nI do not intend to burden this story with accounts of a matter which,\nthough it has never been wholly clear, has been long since fairly\nsettled in the public mind. Mr. Clark was most amiable, accepted my\nstatement that I was travelling for pleasure, and honored Monsieur\nChouteau’s bon (for my purchase of the miniature had deprived me of\nnearly all my ready money), and said that Mr. Temple and I would need\nhorses to get to Les Îles.\n\n“And unless you purpose going back to Kentucky by keel boat, or round by\nsea to Philadelphia or New York, and cross the mountains,” he said,\n“you will need good horses for your journey through Natchez and the\nCumberland country. There is a consignment of Spanish horses from the\nwestward just arrived in town,” he added, “and I shall be pleased to go\nwith you to the place where they are sold. I shall not presume to advise\na Kentuckian on such a purchase.”\n\nThe horses were crowded together under a dirty shed near the levee, and\nthe vessel from which they had been landed rode at anchor in the river.\nThey were the scrawny, tough ponies of the plains, reasonably cheap, and\nit took no great discernment on my part to choose three of the strongest\nand most intelligent looking. We went next to a saddler’s, where I\nselected three saddles and bridles of Spanish workmanship, and Mr. Clark\nagreed to have two of his servants meet us with the horses before Madame\nBouvet’s within the hour. He begged that we would dine with him when we\nreturned from Les Îles.\n\n“You will not find an island, Mr. Ritchie,” he said; “Saint-Gré’s\nplantation is a huge block of land between the river and a cypress swamp\nbehind. Saint-Gré is a man with a wonderful quality of mind, who might,\nlike his ancestors, have made his mark if necessity had probed him or\nopportunity offered. He never forgave the Spanish government for the\nmurder of his father, nor do I blame him. He has his troubles. His son\nis an incurable rake and degenerate, as you may have heard.”\n\nI went back to Madame Bouvet’s, to find Nick emerging from his toilet.\n\n“What deviltry have you been up to, Davy?” he demanded.\n\n“I have been to the House of the Lions to see your divinity,” I\nanswered, “and in a very little while horses will be here to carry us to\nher.”\n\n“What do you mean?” he asked, grasping me by both shoulders.\n\n“I mean that we are going to her father’s plantation, some way down the\nriver.”\n\n“On my honor, Davy, I did not suspect you of so much enterprise,” he\ncried. “And her husband--?”\n\n“Does not exist,” I replied. “Perhaps, after all, I might be able to\ngive you instruction in the conduct of an adventure. The man you chased\nwith such futility was her brother, and he stole from her the miniature\nof which I am now the fortunate possessor.”\n\nHe stared at me for a moment in rueful amazement.\n\n“And her name?” he demanded.\n\n“Antoinette de Saint-Gré,” I answered; “our letter is to her father.”\n\nHe made me a rueful bow.\n\n“I fear that I have undervalued you, Mr. Ritchie,” he said. “You have\nno peer. I am unworthy to accompany you, and furthermore, it would be\nuseless.”\n\n“And why useless!” I inquired, laughing.\n\n“You have doubtless seen the lady, and she is yours,\" said he.\n\n“You forget that I am in love with a miniature,” I said.\n\nIn half an hour we were packed and ready, the horses had arrived, we\nbade good-by to Madame Bouvet and rode down the miry street until we\nreached the road behind the levee. Turning southward, we soon left\nbehind the shaded esplanade and the city’s roofs below us, and came to\nthe first of the plantation houses set back amidst the dark foliage.\nNo tremor shook the fringe of moss that hung from the heavy boughs, so\nstill was the day, and an indefinable, milky haze stretched between\nus and the cloudless sky above. The sun’s rays pierced it and gathered\nfire; the mighty river beside us rolled listless and sullen, flinging\nback the heat defiantly. And on our left was a tropical forest in all\nits bewildering luxuriance, the live-oak, the hackberry, the myrtle, the\nSpanish bayonet in bristling groups, and the shaded places gave out a\nscented moisture like an orangery; anon we passed fields of corn and\ncotton, swamps of rice, stretches of poverty-stricken indigo plants,\ngnawed to the stem by the pest. Our ponies ambled on, unmindful; but\nNick vowed that no woman under heaven would induce him to undertake such\na journey again.\n\nSome three miles out of the city we descried two figures on horseback\ncoming towards us, and quickly perceived that one was a gentleman, the\nother his black servant. They were riding at a more rapid pace than the\nday warranted, but the gentleman reined in his sweating horse as he\ndrew near to us, eyed us with a curiosity tempered by courtesy, bowed\ngravely, and put his horse to a canter again.\n\n“Phew!” said Nick, twisting in his saddle, “I thought that all Creoles\nwere lazy.”\n\n“We have met the exception, perhaps,” I answered. “Did you take in that\nman?”\n\n“His looks were a little remarkable, come to think of it,” answered\nNick, settling down into his saddle again.\n\nIndeed, the man’s face had struck me so forcibly that I was surprised\nout of an inquiry which I had meant to make of him, namely, how far we\nwere from the Saint-Gré plantation. We pursued our way slowly, from\ntime to time catching a glimpse of a dwelling almost hid in the distant\nfoliage, until at length we came to a place a little more pretentious\nthan those which we had seen. From the road a graceful flight of wooden\nsteps climbed the levee and descended on the far side to a boat landing,\nand a straight vista cut through the grove, lined by wild orange trees,\ndisclosed the white pillars and galleries of a far-away plantation\nhouse. The grassy path leading through the vista was trimly kept, and on\neither side of it in the moist, green shade of the great trees flowers\nbloomed in a profusion of startling colors,--in splotches of scarlet and\nwhite and royal purple.\n\nNick slipped from his horse.\n\n“Behold the mansion of Mademoiselle de Saint-Gré,” said he, waving his\nhand up the vista.\n\n“How do you know?” I asked.\n\n“I am told by a part of me that never lies, Davy,” he answered, laying\nhis hand upon his heart; “and besides,” he added, “I should dislike\ndevilishly to go too far on such a day and have to come back again.”\n\n“We will rest here,” I said, laughing, “and send in Benjy to find out.”\n\n“Davy,” he answered, with withering contempt, “you have no more romance\nin you than a turnip. We will go ourselves and see what befalls.”\n\n“Very well, then,” I answered, falling in with his humor, “we will go\nourselves.”\n\nHe brushed his face with his handkerchief, gave himself a pull here and\na pat there, and led the way down the alley. But we had not gone far\nbefore he turned into a path that entered the grove on the right, and to\nthis likewise I made no protest. We soon found ourselves in a heavenly\nspot,--sheltered from the sun’s rays by a dense verdure,--and no one\nwho has not visited these Southern country places can know the teeming\nfragrance there. One shrub (how well I recall it!) was like unto the\nperfume of all the flowers and all the fruits, the very essence of the\ndelicious languor of the place that made our steps to falter. A bird\nshot a bright flame of color through the checkered light ahead of us.\nSuddenly a sound brought us to a halt, and we stood in a tense and\nwondering silence. The words of a song, sung carelessly in a clear,\ngirlish voice, came to us from beyond.\n\n “Je voudrais bien me marier,\n Je voudrais bien me marier,\n Mais j’ai qrand’ peur de me tromper:\n Mais j’ai grand’ peur de me tromper:\n Ils sont si malhonnêtes!\n Ma luron, ma lurette,\n Ils sont si malhonnêtes!\n Ma luron, ma luré.”\n\n“We have come at the very zenith of opportunity,” I whispered.\n\n“Hush!” he said.\n\n “Je ne veux pas d’un avocat,\n Je ne veux pas d’un avocat,\n Car ils aiment trop les ducats,\n Car ils aiment trop les ducats,\n Ils trompent les fillettes,\n Ma luron, ma lurette,\n Ils trompent les fillettes,\n Ma luron, ma luré.”\n\n“Eliminating Mr. Ritchie, I believe,” said Nick, turning on me with a\ngrimace. “But hark again!”\n\n “Je voudrais bien d’un officier:\n Je voudrais bien d’un officier:\n Je marcherais a pas cárres,\n Je marcherais a pas cárres,\n Dans ma joli’ chambrette,\n Ma luron, ma lurette\n Dans ma joli’ chambrette,\n Ma luron, ma luré.”\n\nThe song ceased with a sound that was half laughter, half sigh. Before I\nrealized what he was doing, Nick, instead of retracing his steps towards\nthe house, started forward. The path led through a dense thicket which\nbecame a casino hedge, and suddenly I found myself peering over his\nshoulder into a little garden bewildering in color. In the centre of\nthe garden a great live-oak spread its sheltering branches. Around the\ngnarled trunk was a seat. And on the seat,--her sewing fallen into her\nlap, her lips parted, her eyes staring wide, sat the young lady whom we\nhad seen on the levee the evening before. And Nick was making a bow in\nhis grandest manner.\n\n“Hélas, Mademoiselle,” he said, “je ne suis pas officier, mais on peut\narranger tout cela, sans doute.”\n\nMy breath was taken away by this unheard-of audacity, and I braced\nmyself against screams, flight, and other feminine demonstrations of\nterror. The young lady did nothing of the kind. She turned her back\nto us, leaned against the tree, and to my astonishment I saw her slim\nshoulders shaken with laughter. At length, very slowly, she looked\naround, and in her face struggled curiosity and fear and merriment. Nick\nmade another bow, worthy of Versailles, and she gave a frightened little\nlaugh.\n\n“You are English, Messieurs--yes?” she ventured.\n\n“We were once!” cried Nick, “but we have changed, Mademoiselle.”\n\n“Et quoi donc?” relapsing into her own language.\n\n“Americans,” said he. “Allow me to introduce to you the Honorable David\nRitchie, whom you rejected a few moments ago.”\n\n“Whom I rejected?” she exclaimed.\n\n“Alas,” said Nick, with a commiserating glance at me, “he has the\nmisfortune to be a lawyer.”\n\nMademoiselle shot at me the swiftest and shyest of glances, and turned\nto us once more her quivering shoulders. There was a brief silence.\n\n“Mademoiselle?” said Nick, taking a step on the garden path.\n\n“Monsieur?” she answered, without so much as looking around.\n\n“What, now, would you take this gentleman to be?” he asked with an\ninsistence not to be denied.\n\nAgain she was shaken with laughter, and suddenly to my surprise she\nturned and looked full at me.\n\n“In English, Monsieur, you call it--a gallant?”\n\nMy face fairly tingled, and I heard Nick laughing with unseemly\nmerriment.\n\n“Ah, Mademoiselle,” he cried, “you are a judge of character, and you\nhave read him perfectly.”\n\n“Then I must leave you, Messieurs,” she answered, with her eyes in her\nlap. But she made no move to go.\n\n“You need have no fear of Mr. Ritchie, Mademoiselle,” answered Nick,\ninstantly. “I am here to protect you against his gallantry.”\n\nThis time Nick received the glance, and quailed before it.\n\n“And who--par exemple--is to protect me against--you, Monsieur?” she\nasked in the lowest of voices.\n\n“You forget that I, too, am unprotected--and vulnerable, Mademoiselle,”\n he answered.\n\nHer face was hidden again, but not for long.\n\n“How did you come?” she demanded presently.\n\n“On air,” he answered, “for we saw you in New Orleans yesterday.”\n\n“And--why?”\n\n“Need you ask, Mademoiselle?” said the rogue, and then, with more\neffrontery than ever, he began to sing:--\n\n “‘Je voudrais bien me marier,\n Je voudrais bien me marier,\n Mais j’ai grand’ peur de me tromper.’”\n\nShe rose, her sewing falling to the ground, and took a few startled\nsteps towards us.\n\n“Monsieur! you will be heard,” she cried.\n\n“And put out of the Garden of Eden,” said Nick.\n\n“I must leave you,” she said, with the quaintest of English\npronunciation.\n\nYet she stood irresolute in the garden path, a picture against the dark\ngreen leaves and the flowers. Her age might have been seventeen. Her\ngown was of some soft and light material printed in buds of delicate\ncolor, her slim arms bare above the elbow. She had the ivory complexion\nof the province, more delicate than I had yet seen, and beyond that\nI shall not attempt to describe her, save to add that she was such a\nstrange mixture of innocence and ingenuousness and coquetry as I had not\nimagined. Presently her gaze was fixed seriously on me.\n\n“Do you think it very wrong, Monsieur?” she asked.\n\nI was more than taken aback by this tribute.\n\n“Oh,” cried Nick, “the arbiter of etiquette!”\n\n“Since I am here, Mademoiselle,” I answered, with anything but\nreadiness, “I am not a proper judge.”\n\nHer next question staggered me.\n\n“You are well-born?” she asked.\n\n“Mr. Ritchie’s grandfather was a Scottish earl,” said Nick, immediately,\na piece of news that startled me into protest. “It is true, Davy, though\nyou may not know it,” he added.\n\n“And you, Monsieur?” she said to Nick.\n\n“I am his cousin,--is it not honor enough?” said he.\n\n“Yet you do not resemble one another.”\n\n“Mr. Ritchie has all the good looks in the family,” said Nick.\n\n“Oh!” cried the young lady, and this time she gave us her profile.\n\n“Come, Mademoiselle,” said Nick, “since the fates have cast the die, let\nus all sit down in the shade. The place was made for us.”\n\n“Monsieur!” she cried, giving back, “I have never in my life been alone\nwith gentlemen.”\n\n“But Mr. Ritchie is a duenna to satisfy the most exacting,” said Nick;\n“when you know him better you will believe me.”\n\nShe laughed softly and glanced at me. By this time we were all three\nunder the branches.\n\n“Monsieur, you do not understand the French customs. Mon Dieu, if the\ngood Sister Lorette could see me now--”\n\n“But she is safe in the convent,” said Nick. “Are they going to put\nglass on the walls?”\n\n“And why?” asked Mademoiselle, innocently.\n\n“Because,” said Nick, “because a very bad man has come to New\nOrleans,--one who is given to climbing walls.”\n\n“You?”\n\n“Yes. But when I found that a certain demoiselle had left the convent, I\nwas no longer anxious to climb them.”\n\n“And how did you know that I had left it?”\n\nI was at a loss to know whether this were coquetry or innocence.\n\n“Because I saw you on the levee,” said Nick.\n\n“You saw me on the levee?” she repeated, giving back.\n\n“And I had a great fear,” the rogue persisted.\n\n“A fear of what?”\n\n“A fear that you were married,” he said, with a boldness that made\nme blush. As for Mademoiselle, a color that vied with the June roses\ncharged through her cheeks. She stooped to pick up her sewing, but Nick\nwas before her.\n\n“And why did you think me married?” she asked in a voice so low that we\nscarcely heard.\n\n“Faith,” said Nick, “because you seemed to be quarrelling with a man.”\n\nShe turned to him with an irresistible seriousness.\n\n“And is that your idea of marriage, Monsieur?”\n\nThis time it was I who laughed, for he had been hit very fairly.\n\n“Mademoiselle,” said he, “I did not for a moment think it could have\nbeen a love match.”\n\nMademoiselle turned away and laughed.\n\n“You are the very strangest man I have ever seen,” she said.\n\n“Shall I give you my notion of a love match, Mademoiselle?” said Nick.\n\n“I should think you might be well versed in the subject, Monsieur,”\n she answered, speaking to the tree, “but here is scarcely the time and\nplace.” She wound up her sewing, and faced him. “I must really leave\nyou,” she said.\n\nHe took a step towards her and stood looking down into her face. Her\neyes dropped.\n\n“And am I never to see you again?” he asked.\n\n“Monsieur!” she cried softly, “I do not know who you are.” She made him\na courtesy, took a few steps in the opposite path, and turned. “That\ndepends upon your ingenuity,” she added; “you seem to have no lack of\nit, Monsieur.”\n\nNick was transported.\n\n“You must not go,” he cried.\n\n“Must not? How dare you speak to me thus, Monsieur?” Then she tempered\nit. “There is a lady here whom I love, and who is ill. I must not be\nlong from her bedside.”\n\n“She is very ill?” said Nick, probably for want of something better.\n\n“She is not really ill, Monsieur, but depressed--is not that the\nword? She is a very dear friend, and she has had trouble--so much,\nMonsieur,--and my mother brought her here. We love her as one of the\nfamily.”\n\nThis was certainly ingenuous, and it was plain that the girl gave us\nthis story through a certain nervousness, for she twisted her sewing in\nher fingers as she spoke.\n\n“Mademoiselle,” said Nick, “I would not keep you from such an errand of\nmercy.”\n\nShe gave him a grateful look, more dangerous than any which had gone\nbefore.\n\n“And besides,” he went on, “we have come to stay awhile with you, Mr.\nRitchie and myself.”\n\n“You have come to stay awhile?” she said.\n\nI thought it time that the farce were ended.\n\n“We have come with letters to your father, Monsieur de Saint-Gré,\nMademoiselle,” I said, “and I should like very much to see him, if he is\nat leisure.”\n\nMademoiselle stared at me in unfeigned astonishment.\n\n“But did you not meet him, Monsieur?” she demanded. “He left an hour ago\nfor New Orleans. You must have met a gentleman riding very fast.”\n\nIt was my turn to be astonished.\n\n“But that was not your father!” I exclaimed.\n\n“Et pourquoi non?” she said.\n\n“Is not your father the stout gentleman whom I saw with you on the levee\nlast evening?” I asked.\n\nShe laughed.\n\n“You have been observing, Monsieur,” she said. “That was my uncle,\nMonsieur de Beauséjour. You saw me quarrelling with my brother,\nAuguste,” she went on a little excitedly. “Oh, I am very much ashamed\nof it. I was so angry. My cousin, Mademoiselle Hélène de Saint-Gré, has\njust sent me from France such a beautiful miniature, and Auguste fell in\nlove with it.”\n\n“Fell in love with it!” I exclaimed involuntarily.\n\n“You should see it, Monsieur, and I think you also would fall in love\nwith it.”\n\n“I have not a doubt of it,” said Nick.\n\nMademoiselle made the faintest of moues.\n\n“Auguste is very wild, as you say,” she continued, addressing me, “he is\na great care to my father. He intrigues, you know, he wishes Louisiane\nto become French once more,--as we all do. But I should not say this,\nMonsieur,” she added in a startled tone. “You will not tell? No, I know\nyou will not. We do not like the Spaniards. They killed my grandfather\nwhen they came to take the province. And once, the Governor-general Miro\nsent for my father and declared he would put Auguste in prison if he did\nnot behave himself. But I have forgotten the miniature. When Auguste\nsaw that he fell in love with it, and now he wishes to go to France and\nobtain a commission through our cousin, the Marquis of Saint-Gré, and\nmarry Mademoiselle Hélène.”\n\n“A comprehensive programme, indeed,” said Nick.\n\n“My father has gone back to New Orleans,” she said, “to get the\nminiature from Auguste. He took it from me, Monsieur.” She raised her\nhead a little proudly. “If my brother had asked it, I might have given\nit to him, though I treasured it. But Auguste is so--impulsive. My uncle\ntold my father, who is very angry. He will punish Auguste severely,\nand--I do not like to have him punished. Oh, I wish I had the\nminiature.”\n\n“Your wish is granted, Mademoiselle,” I answered, drawing the case from\nmy pocket and handing it to her.\n\nShe took it, staring at me with eyes wide with wonder, and then she\nopened it mechanically.\n\n“Monsieur,” she said with great dignity, “do you mind telling me where\nyou obtained this?”\n\n“I found it, Mademoiselle,” I answered; and as I spoke I felt Nick’s\nfingers on my arm.\n\n“You found it? Where? How, Monsieur?”\n\n“At Madame Bouvet’s, the house where we stayed.”\n\n“Oh,” she said with a sigh of relief, “he must have dropped it. It\nis there where he meets his associates, where they talk of the French\nLouisiane.”\n\nAgain I felt Nick pinching me, and I gave a sigh of relief. Mademoiselle\nwas about to continue, but I interrupted her.\n\n“How long will your father be in New Orleans, Mademoiselle?” I asked.\n\n“Until he finds Auguste,” she answered. “It may be days, but he will\nstay, for he is very angry. But will you not come into the house,\nMessieurs, and be presented to my mother?” she asked. “I have been\nvery--inhospitable,” she added with a glance at Nick.\n\nWe followed her through winding paths bordered by shrubs and flowers,\nand presently came to a low house surrounded by a wide, cool gallery,\nand shaded by spreading trees. Behind it were clustered the kitchens and\nquarters of the house servants. Mademoiselle, picking up her dress,\nran up the steps ahead of us and turned to the left in the hall into\na darkened parlor. The floor was bare, save for a few mats, and in the\ncorner was a massive escritoire of mahogany with carved feet, and\nthere were tables and chairs of a like pattern. It was a room of\nmore distinction than I had seen since I had been in Charlestown, and\nreflected the solidity of its owners.\n\n“If you will be so kind as to wait here, Messieurs,” said Mademoiselle,\n“I will call my mother.”\n\nAnd she left us.\n\nI sat down, rather uncomfortably, but Nick took a stand and stood\nstaring down at me with folded arms.\n\n“How I have undervalued you, Davy,” he said.\n\n“I am not proud of it,” I answered shortly.\n\n“What the deuce is to do now?” he asked.\n\n“I cannot linger here,” I answered; “I have business with Monsieur de\nSaint-Gré, and I must go back to New Orleans at once.”\n\n“Then I will wait for you,” said Nick. “Davy, I have met my fate.”\n\nI laughed in spite of myself.\n\n“It seems to me that I have heard that remark before,” I answered.\n\nHe had not time to protest, for we heard footsteps in the hall, and\nMademoiselle entered, leading an older lady by the hand. In the light\nof the doorway I saw that she was thin and small and yellow, but\nher features had a regularity and her mien a dignity which made her\nimpressing, which would have convinced a stranger that she was a person\nof birth and breeding. Her hair, tinged with gray, was crowned by a lace\ncap.\n\n“Madame,” I said, bowing and coming forward, “I am David Ritchie, from\nKentucky, and this is my cousin, Mr. Temple, of Charlestown. Monsieur\nGratiot and Colonel Chouteau, of St. Louis, have been kind enough to\ngive us letters to Monsieur de Saint-Gré.” And I handed her one of the\nletters which I had ready.\n\n“You are very welcome, Messieurs,” she answered, with the same\ndelightful accent which her daughter had used, “and you are especially\nwelcome from such a source. The friends of Colonel Chouteau and of\nMonsieur Gratiot are our friends. You will remain with us, I hope,\nMessieurs,” she continued. “Monsieur de Saint-Gré will return in a few\ndays at best.”\n\n“By your leave, Madame, I will go to New Orleans at once and try to find\nMonsieur,” I said, “for I have business with him.”\n\n“You will return with him, I hope,” said Madame.\n\nI bowed.\n\n“And Mr. Temple will remain?” she asked, with a questioning look at\nNick.\n\n“With the greatest pleasure in the world, Madame,” he answered, and\nthere was no mistaking his sincerity. As he spoke, Mademoiselle turned\nher back on him.\n\nI would not wait for dinner, but pausing only for a sip of cool Madeira\nand some other refreshment, I made my farewells to the ladies. As I\nstarted out of the door to find Benjy, who had been waiting for more\nthan an hour, Mademoiselle gave me a neatly folded note.\n\n“You will be so kind as to present that to my father, Monsieur,” she\nsaid.\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. MONSIEUR AUGUSTE ENTRAPPED\n\nIt may be well to declare here and now that I do not intend to burden\nthis story with the business which had brought me to New Orleans. While\nin the city during the next few days I met a young gentleman named\nDaniel Clark, a nephew of that Mr. Clark of whom I have spoken. Many\nyears after the time of which I write this Mr. Daniel Clark the younger,\nwho became a rich merchant and an able man of affairs, published a book\nwhich sets forth with great clearness proofs of General Wilkinson’s\nduplicity and treason, and these may be read by any who would satisfy\nhimself further on the subject. Mr. Wharton had not believed, nor had\nI flattered myself that I should be able to bring such a fox as General\nWilkinson to earth. Abundant circumstantial evidence I obtained:\nWilkinson’s intimacy with Miro was well known, and I likewise learned\nthat a cipher existed between them. The permit to trade given by Miro to\nWilkinson was made no secret of. In brief, I may say that I discovered\nas much as could be discovered by any one without arousing suspicion,\nand that the information with which I returned to Kentucky was of some\nmaterial value to my employers.\n\nI have to thank Monsieur Philippe de St. Gré for a great deal. And I\ntake this opportunity to set down the fact that I have rarely met a more\nremarkable man.\n\nAs I rode back to town alone a whitish film was spread before the sun,\nand ere I had come in sight of the fortifications the low forest on the\nwestern bank was a dark green blur against the sky. The esplanade on\nthe levee was deserted, the willow trees had a mournful look, while the\nbright tiles of yesterday seemed to have faded to a sombre tone. I spied\nXavier on a bench smoking with some friends of his.\n\n“He make much rain soon, Michié,” he cried. “You hev good time, I hope,\nMichié.”\n\nI waved my hand and rode on, past the Place d’Armes with its white\ndiagonal bands strapping its green like a soldier’s front, and as I drew\nup before the gate of the House of the Lions the warning taps of the\nstorm were drumming on the magnolia leaves. The same gardienne came to\nmy knock, and in answer to her shrill cry a negro lad appeared to hold\nmy horse. I was ushered into a brick-paved archway that ran under the\nlatticed gallery toward a flower-filled court-yard, but ere we reached\nthis the gardienne turned to the left up a flight of steps with a\ndelicate balustrade which led to an open gallery above. And there\nstood the gentleman whom we had met hurrying to town in the morning. A\ngentleman he was, every inch of him. He was dressed in black silk, his\nhair in a cue, and drawn away from a face of remarkable features. He\nhad a high-bridged nose, a black eye that held an inquiring sternness, a\nchin indented, and a receding forehead. His stature was indeterminable.\nIn brief, he might have stood for one of those persons of birth and\nability who become prime ministers of France.\n\n“Monsieur de St. Gré?” I said.\n\nHe bowed gracefully, but with a tinge of condescension. I was awed, and\nconsidering the relations which I had already had with his family, I\nmust admit that I was somewhat frightened.\n\n“Monsieur,” I said, “I bring letters to you from Monsieur Gratiot and\nColonel Chouteau of St. Louis. One of these I had the honor to deliver\nto Madame de St. Gré, and here is the other.”\n\n“Ah,” he said, with another keen glance, “I met you this morning, did I\nnot?”\n\n“You did, Monsieur.”\n\nHe broke the seal, and, going to the edge of the gallery, held the\nletter to the light. As he read a peal of thunder broke distantly, the\nrain came down in a flood. Then he folded the paper carefully and turned\nto me again.\n\n“You will make my house your home, Mr. Ritchie,” he said; “recommended\nfrom such a source, I will do all I can to serve you. But where is this\nMr. Temple of whom the letter speaks? His family in Charlestown is known\nto me by repute.”\n\n“By Madame de St. Gré’s invitation he remained at Les Îles,” I answered,\nspeaking above the roar of the rain.\n\n“I was just going to the table,” said Monsieur de St. Gré; “we will talk\nas we eat.”\n\nHe led the way into the dining room, and as I stood on the threshold\na bolt of great brilliancy lighted its yellow-washed floor and walnut\nfurniture of a staid pattern. A deafening crash followed as we took our\nseats, while Monsieur de St. Gré’s man lighted four candles of green\nmyrtle-berry wax.\n\n“Monsieur Gratiot’s letter speaks vaguely of politics, Mr. Ritchie,”\n began Monsieur de St. Gré. He spoke English perfectly, save for an\noccasional harsh aspiration which I cannot imitate.\n\nDirecting his man to fetch a certain kind of Madeira, he turned to\nme with a look of polite inquiry which was scarcely reassuring. And I\nreflected, the caution with which I had been endowed coming uppermost,\nthat the man might have changed since Monsieur Gratiot had seen him.\nHe had, moreover, the air of a man who gives a forced attention, which\nseemed to me the natural consequences of the recent actions of his son.\n\n“I fear that I am intruding upon your affairs, Monsieur,” I answered.\n\n“Not at all, sir,” he said politely. “I have met that charming\ngentleman, Mr. Wilkinson, who came here to brush away the causes of\ndissension, and cement a friendship between Kentucky and Louisiana.”\n\nIt was most fortunate that the note of irony did not escape me.\n\n“Where governments failed, General Wilkinson succeeded,” I answered\ndryly.\n\nMonsieur de St. Gré glanced at me, and an enigmatical smile spread over\nhis face. I knew then that the ice was cracked between us. Yet he was\ntoo much a man of the world not to make one more tentative remark.\n\n“A union between Kentucky and Louisiana would be a resistless force in\nthe world, Mr. Ritchie,” he said.\n\n“It was Nebuchadnezzar who dreamed of a composite image, Monsieur,” I\nanswered; “and Mr. Wilkinson forgets one thing,--that Kentucky is a part\nof the United States.”\n\nAt that Monsieur St. Gré laughed outright. He became a different man,\nthough he lost none of his dignity.\n\n“I should have had more faith in my old friend Gratiot,” he said; “but\nyou will pardon me if I did not recognize at once the statesman he had\nsent me, Mr. Ritchie.”\n\nIt was my turn to laugh.\n\n“Monsieur,” he went on, returning to that dignity of mien which marked\nhim, “my political opinions are too well known that I should make a\nmystery of them to you. I was born a Frenchman, I shall die a Frenchman,\nand I shall never be happy until Louisiana is French once more. My\ngreat-grandfather, a brother of the Marquis de St. Gré of that time, and\na wild blade enough, came out with D’Iberville. His son, my grandfather,\nwas the Commissary-general of the colony under the Marquis de Vaudreuil.\nHe sent me to France for my education, where I was introduced at court\nby my kinsman, the old Marquis, who took a fancy to me and begged me\nto remain. It was my father’s wish that I should return, and I did not\ndisobey him. I had scarcely come back, Monsieur, when that abominable\nsecret bargain of Louis the Fifteenth became known, ceding Louisiana to\nSpain. You may have heard of the revolution which followed here. It was\na mild affair, and the remembrance of it makes me smile to this day,\nthough with bitterness. I was five and twenty, hot-headed, and French.\nQue voulez-vous?” and Monsieur de St. Gré shrugged his shoulders.\n“O’Reilly, the famous Spanish general, came with his men-of-war. Well\nI remember the days we waited with leaden hearts for the men-of-war to\ncome up from the English turn; and I can see now the cannon frowning\nfrom the ports, the grim spars, the high poops crowded with officers,\nthe great anchors splashing the yellow water. I can hear the chains\nrunning. The ships were in line of battle before the town, their flying\nbridges swung to the levee, and they loomed above us like towering\nfortresses. It was dark, Monsieur, such as this afternoon, and we poor\nFrench colonists stood huddled in the open space below, waiting for we\nknew not what.”\n\nHe paused, and I started, for the picture he drew had carried me out of\nmyself.\n\n“On the 18th of August, 1769,--well I remember the day,” Monsieur de\nSt. Gré continued, “the Spanish troops landed late in the afternoon,\ntwenty-six hundred strong, the artillery rumbling over the bridges, the\nhorses wheeling and rearing. And they drew up as in line of battle in\nthe Place d’Armes,--dragoons, fusileros de montañas, light and heavy\ninfantry. Where were our white cockades then? Fifty guns shook the town,\nthe great O’Reilly limped ashore through the smoke, and Louisiana was\nlost to France. We had a cowardly governor, Monsieur, whose name is\nwritten in the annals of the province in letters of shame. He betrayed\nMonsieur de St. Gré and others into O’Reilly’s hands, and when my father\nwas cast into prison he was seized with such a fit of anger that he\ndied.”\n\nMonsieur de St. Gré was silent. Without, under the eaves of the gallery,\na white rain fell, and a steaming moisture arose from the court-yard.\n\n“What I have told you, Monsieur, is common knowledge. Louisiana has been\nSpanish for twenty years. I no longer wear the white cockade, for I am\nolder now.” He smiled. “Strange things are happening in France, and the\nold order to which I belong” (he straightened perceptibly) “seems to be\ntottering. I have ceased to intrigue, but thank God I have not ceased to\npray. Perhaps--who knows?--perhaps I may live to see again the lily of\nFrance stirred by the river breeze.”\n\nHe fell into a revery, his fine head bent a little, but presently\naroused himself and eyed me curiously. I need not say that I felt a\nstrange liking for Monsieur de St. Gré.\n\n“And now, Mr. Ritchie,” he said, “will you tell me who you are, and how\nI can serve you?”\n\nThe servant had put the coffee on the table and left the room. Monsieur\nde St. Gré himself poured me a cup from the dainty, quaintly wrought\nLouis Quinze coffeepot, graven with the coat of arms of his family. As\nwe sat talking, my admiration for my host increased, for I found that he\nwas familiar not only with the situation in Kentucky, but that he\nalso knew far more than I of the principles and personnel of the new\ngovernment of which General Washington was President. That he had little\nsympathy with government by the people was natural, for he was a Creole,\nand behind that a member of an order which detested republics. When we\nwere got beyond these topics the rain had ceased, the night had fallen,\nthe green candles had burned low. And suddenly, as he spoke of Les\nÎsles, I remembered the note Mademoiselle had given me for him, and\nI apologized for my forgetfulness. He read it, and dropped it with an\nexclamation.\n\n“My daughter tells me that you have returned to her a miniature which\nshe lost, Monsieur,” he said.\n\n“I had that pleasure,” I answered.\n\n“And that--you found this miniature at Madame Bouvet’s. Was this the\ncase?” And he stared hard at me.\n\nI nodded, but for the life of me I could not speak. It seemed an outrage\nto lie to such a man. He did not answer, but sat lost in thought,\ndrumming with his fingers on the tables until the noise of the slamming\nof a door aroused him to a listening posture. The sound of subdued\nvoices came from the archway below us, and one of these, from an\noccasional excited and feminine note, I thought to be the gardienne’s.\nMonsieur de St. Gré thrust back his chair, and in three strides was at\nthe edge of the gallery.\n\n“Auguste!” he cried.\n\nSilence.\n\n“Auguste, come up to me at once,” he said in French.\n\nAnother silence, then something that sounded like “Sapristi!” a groan\nfrom the gardienne, and a step was heard on the stairway. My own\ndiscomfort increased, and I would have given much to be in any other\nplace in the world. Auguste had arrived at the head of the steps but was\napparently unable to get any farther.\n\n“Bon soir, mon père,” he said.\n\n“Like a dutiful son,” said Monsieur de St. Gré, “you heard I was in\ntown, and called to pay your respects, I am sure. I am delighted to find\nyou. In fact, I came to town for that purpose.”\n\n“Lisette--” began Auguste.\n\n“Thought that I did not wish to be disturbed, no doubt,” said his\nfather. “Walk in, Auguste.”\n\nMonsieur Auguste’s slim figure appeared in the doorway. He caught sight\nof me, halted, backed, and stood staring with widened eyes. The candles\nthrew their light across his shoulder on the face of the elder Monsieur\nde St. Gré. Auguste was a replica of his father, with the features\nminimized to regularity and the brow narrowed. The complexion of the one\nwas a clear saffron, while the boy’s skin was mottled, and he was not\ntwenty.\n\n“What is the matter?” said Monsieur de St. Gré.\n\n“You--you have a visitor!” stammered Auguste, with a tact that savored\nof practice. Yet there was a sorry difference between this and the\nhaughty young patrician who had sold me the miniature.\n\n“Who brings me good news,” said Monsieur de St. Gré, in English. “Mr.\nRitchie, allow me to introduce my son, Auguste.”\n\nI felt Monsieur de St. Gré’s eyes on me as I bowed, and I began to think\nI was in near as great a predicament as Auguste. Monsieur de St. Gré was\nmanaging the matter with infinite wisdom.\n\n“Sit down, my son,” he said; “you have no doubt been staying with your\nuncle.” Auguste sat down, still staring. “Does your aunt’s health mend?”\n\n“She is better to-night, father,” said the son, in English which might\nhave been improved.\n\n“I am glad of it,” said Monsieur de St. Gré, taking a chair. “André,\nfill the glasses.”\n\nThe silent, linen-clad mulatto poured out the Madeira, shot a look at\nAuguste, and retired softly.\n\n“There has been a heavy rain, Monsieur,” said Monsieur de St. Gré to\nme, “but I think the air is not yet cleared. I was about to say, Mr.\nRitchie, when my son called to pay his respects, that the miniature of\nwhich we were speaking is one of the most remarkable paintings I have\never seen.” Auguste’s thin fingers were clutching the chair. “I have\nnever beheld Mademoiselle Hélène de St. Gré, for my cousin, the Marquis,\nwas not married when I left France. He was a captain in a regiment of\nhis Majesty’s Mousquetaires, since abolished. But I am sure that the\nlikeness of Mademoiselle must be a true one, for it has the stamp of a\nremarkable personality, though Hélène can be only eighteen. Women, with\nus, mature quickly, Monsieur. And this portrait tallies with what I have\nheard of her character. You no doubt observed the face, Monsieur,--that\nof a true aristocrat. But I was speaking of her character. When she was\ntwelve, she said something to a cardinal for which her mother made her\nkeep her room a whole day. For Mademoiselle would not retract, and,\npardieu, I believe his Eminence was wrong. The Marquise is afraid of\nher. And when first Hélène was presented formally she made such a witty\nretort to the Queen’s sally that her Majesty insisted upon her coming\nto court. On every New Year’s day I have always sent a present of coffee\nand périque to my cousin the Marquis, and it is Mademoiselle who writes\nto thank us. Parole d’honneur, her letters make me see again the\npeople amongst whom she moves,--the dukes and duchesses, the cardinals,\nbishops, and generals. She draws them to the life, Monsieur, with a\ntouch that makes them all ridiculous. His Majesty does not escape. God\nforgive him, he is indeed an amiable, weak person for calling a States\nGeneral. And the Queen, a frivolous lady, but true to those whom she\nloves, and beginning now to realize the perils of the situation.” He\npaused. “Is it any wonder that Auguste has fallen in love with\nhis cousin, Monsieur? That he loses his head, forgets that he is a\ngentleman, and steals her portrait from his sister!”\n\nHad I not been so occupied with my own fate in the outcome of this\ninquisition, I should have been sorry for Auguste. And yet this feeling\ncould not have lasted, for the young gentleman sprang to his feet, cast\na glance at me which was not without malignance, and faced his father,\nhis lips twitching with anger and fear. Monsieur de St. Gré sat\nundisturbed.\n\n“He is so much in love with the portrait, Monsieur, that he loses it.”\n\n“Loses it!” cried Auguste.\n\n“Precisely,” said his father, dryly, “for Mr. Ritchie tells me he found\nit--at Madame Bouvet’s, was it not, Monsieur?”\n\nAuguste looked at me.\n\n“Mille diables!” he said, and sat down again heavily.\n\n“Mr. Ritchie has returned it to your sister, a service which puts him\nheavily in our debt,” said Monsieur de St. Gré. “Now, sir,” he added to\nme, rising, “you have had a tiresome day. I will show you to your room,\nand in the morning we will begin our--investigations.”\n\nHe clapped his hands, the silent mulatto appeared with a new candle, and\nI followed my host down the gallery to a room which he flung open at the\nfar end. A great four-poster bedstead was in one corner, and a polished\nmahogany dresser in the other.\n\n“We have saved some of our family furniture from the fire, Mr. Ritchie,”\nsaid Monsieur de St. Gré; “that bed was brought from Paris by my father\nforty years ago. I hope you will rest well.”\n\nHe set the candle on the table, and as he bowed there was a trace of\nan enigmatical smile about his mouth. How much he knew of Auguste’s\ntransaction I could not fathom, but the matter and the scarcely\ncreditable part I had played in it kept me awake far into the night. I\nwas just falling into a troubled sleep when a footstep on the gallery\nstartled me back to consciousness. It was followed by a light tap on the\ndoor.\n\n“Monsieur Reetchie,” said a voice.\n\nIt was Monsieur Auguste. He was not an imposing figure in his nightrail,\nand by the light of the carefully shaded candle he held in his hand I\nsaw that he had hitherto deceived me in the matter of his calves. He\nstood peering at me as I lay under the mosquito bar.\n\n“How is it I can thank you, Monsieur!” he exclaimed in a whisper.\n\n“By saying nothing, Monsieur,” I answered.\n\n“You are noble, you are generous, and--and one day I will give you the\nmoney back,” he added with a burst of magniloquence. “You have behave\nvery well, Monsieur, and I mek you my friend. Behol’ Auguste de St. Gré,\nentirely at your service, Monsieur.” He made a sweeping bow that might\nhave been impressive save for the nightrail, and sought my hand, which\nhe grasped in a fold of the mosquito bar.\n\n“I am overcome, Monsieur,” I said.\n\n“Monsieur Reetchie, you are my friend, my intimate” (he put an aspirate\non the word). “I go to tell you one leetle secret. I find that I can\nrepose confidence in you. My father does not understan’ me, you saw,\nMonsieur, he does not appreciate--that is the Engleesh. Mon Dieu, you\nsaw it this night. I, who spik to you, am made for a courtier, a noble.\nI have the gift. La Louisiane--she is not so big enough for me.” He\nlowered his voice still further, and bent nearer to me. “Monsieur, I\nrun away to France. My cousin the Marquis will help me. You will hear\nof Auguste de St. Gré at Versailles, at Trianon, at Chantilly, and\npeut-être--”\n\n“It is a worthy campaign, Monsieur,” I interrupted.\n\nA distant sound broke the stillness, and Auguste was near to dropping\nthe candle on me.\n\n“Adieu, Monsieur,” he whispered; “milles tonneres, I have done one\nextraordinaire foolish thing when I am come to this house to-night.”\n\nAnd he disappeared, shading his candle, as he had come.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. RETRIBUTION\n\nDuring the next two days I had more evidence of Monsieur de St. Gré’s\nability, and, thanks to his conduct of my campaign, not the least\nsuspicion of my mission to New Orleans got abroad. Certain gentlemen\nwere asked to dine, we called on others, and met still others casually\nin their haunts of business or pleasure. I was troubled because of\nthe inconvenience and discomfort to which my host put himself, for New\nOrleans in the dog-days may be likened in climate to the under side of\nthe lid of a steam kettle. But at length, on the second evening, after\nwe had supped on jambalaya and rice cakes and other dainties, and the\nlast guest had gone, my host turned to me.\n\n“The rest of the burrow is the same, Mr. Ritchie, until it comes to the\nlight again.”\n\n“And the fox has crawled out of the other end,” I said.\n\n“Precisely,” he answered, laughing; “in short, if you were to remain in\nNew Orleans until New Year’s, you would not learn a whit more. To-morrow\nmorning I have a little business of my own to transact, and we shall\nget to Les Îles in time for dinner. No, don’t thank me,” he protested;\n“there’s a certain rough honesty and earnestness ingrained in you\nwhich I like. And besides,” he added, smiling, “you are poor indeed at\nthanking, Mr. Ritchie. You could never do it gracefully. But if ever I\nwere in trouble, I believe that I might safely call on you.”\n\nThe next day was a rare one, for a wind from somewhere had blown the\nmoisture away a little, the shadows were clearer cut, and by noon\nMonsieur de St. Gré and I were walking our horses in the shady road\nbehind the levee. We were followed at a respectful distance by André,\nMonsieur’s mulatto body-servant, and as we rode my companion gave me\nstories of the owners of the different plantations we passed, and spoke\nof many events of interest in the history of the colony. Presently he\nceased to talk, and rode in silence for many minutes. And then he turned\nupon me suddenly.\n\n“Mr. Ritchie,” he said, “you have seen my son. It may be that in him\nI am paying the price of my sins. I have done everything to set him\nstraight, but in vain. Monsieur, every son of the St. Grés has awakened\nsooner or later to a sense of what becomes him. But Auguste is a fool,”\nhe cried bitterly,--a statement which I could not deny; “were it not for\nmy daughter, Antoinette, I should be a miserable man indeed.”\n\nInasmuch as he was not a person of confidences, I felt the more\nflattered that he should speak so plainly to me, and I had a great\nsympathy for this strong man who could not help himself.\n\n“You have observed Antoinette, Mr. Ritchie,” he continued; “she is a\nstrange mixture of wilfulness and caprice and self-sacrifice, and she\nhas at times a bit of that wit which has made our house for generations\nthe intimates--I may say--of sovereigns.”\n\nThis peculiar pride of race would have amused me in another man. I found\nmyself listening to Monsieur de St. Gré with gravity, and I did not dare\nto reply that I had had evidence of Mademoiselle’s aptness of retort.\n\n“She has been my companion since she was a child, Monsieur. She has\ndisobeyed me, flaunted me, nursed me in illness, championed me behind my\nback. I have a little book which I have kept of her sayings and doings,\nwhich may interest you, Monsieur. I will show it you.”\n\nThis indeed was a new side of Monsieur de St. Gré, and I reflected\nrather ruefully upon the unvarnished truth of what Mr. Wharton had told\nme,--ay, and what Colonel Clark had emphasized long before. It was my\nfate never to be treated as a young man. It struck me that Monsieur de\nSt. Gré had never even considered me in the light of a possible suitor\nfor his daughter’s hand.\n\n“I should be delighted to see them, Monsieur,” I answered.\n\n“Would you?” he exclaimed, his face lighting up as he glanced at me.\n“Alas, Madame de St. Gré and I have promised to go to our neighbors’,\nMonsieur and Madame Bertrand’s, for to-night. But, to-morrow, if you\nhave leisure, we shall look at it together. And not a word of this to my\ndaughter, Monsieur,” he added apprehensively; “she would never forgive\nme. She dislikes my talking of her, but at times I cannot help it. It\nwas only last year that she was very angry with me, and would not speak\nto me for days, because I boasted of her having watched at the bedside\nof a poor gentleman who came here and got the fever. You will not tell\nher?”\n\n“Indeed I shall not, Monsieur,” I answered.\n\n“It is strange,” he said abruptly, “it is strange that this gentleman\nand his wife should likewise have had letters to us from Monsieur\nGratiot. They came from St. Louis, and they were on their way to Paris.”\n\n“To Paris?” I cried; “what was their name?”\n\nHe looked at me in surprise.\n\n“Clive,” he said.\n\n“Clive!” I cried, leaning towards him in my saddle. “Clive! And what\nbecame of them?”\n\nThis time he gave me one of his searching looks, and it was not unmixed\nwith astonishment.\n\n“Why do you ask, Monsieur?” he demanded. “Did you know them?”\n\nI must have shown that I was strangely agitated. For the moment I could\nnot answer.\n\n“Monsieur Gratiot himself spoke of them to me,” I said, after a little;\n“he said they were an interesting couple.”\n\n“Pardieu!” exclaimed Monsieur de St. Gré, “he put it mildly.” He gave me\nanother look. “There was something about them, Monsieur, which I could\nnot fathom. Why were they drifting? They were people of quality who had\nseen the world, who were by no means paupers, who had no cause to travel\nsave a certain restlessness. And while they were awaiting the sailing\nof the packet for France they came to our house--the old one in the\nRue Bourbon that was burned. I would not speak ill of the dead, but Mr.\nClive I did not like. He fell sick of the fever in my house, and it was\nthere that Antoinette and Madame de St. Gré took turns with his wife in\nwatching at his bedside. I could do nothing with Antoinette, Monsieur,\nand she would not listen to my entreaties, my prayers, my commands. We\nburied the poor fellow in the alien ground, for he did not die in the\nChurch, and after that my daughter clung to Mrs. Clive. She would not\nlet her go, and the packet sailed without her. I have never seen such\naffection. I may say,” he added quickly, “that Madame de St. Gré and I\nshare in it, for Mrs. Clive is a lovable woman and a strong character.\nAnd into the great sorrow that lies behind her life, we have never\nprobed.”\n\n“And she is with you now, Monsieur?” I asked.\n\n“She lives with us, Monsieur,” he answered simply, “and I hope for\nalways. No,” he said quickly, “it is not charity,--she has something of\nher own. We love her, and she is the best of companions for my daughter.\nFor the rest, Monsieur, she seems benumbed, with no desire to go back or\nto go farther.”\n\nAn entrance drive to the plantation of Les Îles, unknown to Nick and me,\nled off from the main road like a green tunnel arched out of the forest.\nMy feelings as we entered this may be imagined, for I was suddenly\nconfronted with the situation which I had dreaded since my meeting with\nNick at Jonesboro. I could scarcely allow myself even the faint hope\nthat Mrs. Clive might not prove to be Mrs. Temple after all. Whilst I\nwas in this agony of doubt and indecision, the drive suddenly came out\non a shaded lawn dotted with flowering bushes. There was the house with\nits gallery, its curved dormer roof and its belvedere; and a white,\ngirlish figure flitted down the steps. It was Mademoiselle Antoinette,\nand no sooner had her father dismounted than she threw herself into his\narms. Forgetful of my presence, he stood murmuring in her ear like a\nlover; and as I watched them my trouble slipped from my mind, and gave\nplace to a vaguer regret that I had been a wanderer throughout my life.\nPresently she turned up to him a face on which was written something\nwhich he could not understand. His own stronger features reflected a\nvague disquiet.\n\n“What is it, ma chérie?”\n\nWhat was it indeed? Something was in her eyes which bore a message and\npresentiment to me. She dropped them, fastening in the lapel of his\ncoat a flaunting red flower set against a shining leaf, and there was a\ngentle, joyous subterfuge in her answer.\n\n“Thou pardoned Auguste, as I commanded?” she said. They were speaking in\nthe familiar French.\n\n“Ha, diable! is it that which disquiets thee?” said her father. “We will\nnot speak of Auguste. Dost thou know Monsieur Ritchie, ‘Toinette?”\n\nShe disengaged herself and dropped me a courtesy, her eyes seeking\nthe ground. But she said not a word. At that instant Madame de St. Gré\nherself appeared on the gallery, followed by Nick, who came down the\nsteps with a careless self-confidence to greet the master. Indeed, a\nstranger might have thought that Mr. Temple was the host, and I saw\nAntoinette watching him furtively with a gleam of amusement in her eyes.\n\n“I am delighted to see you at last, Monsieur,” said my cousin. “I am\nNicholas Temple, and I have been your guest for three days.”\n\nHad Monsieur de St. Gré been other than the soul of hospitality, it\nwould have been impossible not to welcome such a guest. Our host had,\nin common with his daughter, a sense of humor. There was a quizzical\nexpression on his fine face as he replied, with the barest glance at\nMademoiselle Antoinette:--\n\n“I trust you have been--well entertained, Mr. Temple. My daughter has\nbeen accustomed only to the society of her brother and cousins.”\n\n“Faith, I should not have supposed it,” said Nick, instantly, a remark\nwhich caused the color to flush deeply into Mademoiselle’s face. I\nlooked to see Monsieur de St. Gré angry. He tried, indeed, to be grave,\nbut smiled irresistibly as he mounted the steps to greet his wife, who\nstood demurely awaiting his caress. And in this interval Mademoiselle\nshot at Nick a swift and withering look as she passed him. He returned a\ngrimace.\n\n“Messieurs,” said Monsieur de St. Gré, turning to us, “dinner will soon\nbe ready--if you will be so good as to pardon me until then.”\n\nNick followed Mademoiselle with his eyes until she had disappeared\nbeyond the hall. She did not so much as turn. Then he took me by the arm\nand led me to a bench under a magnolia a little distance away, where he\nseated himself, and looked up at me despairingly.\n\n“Behold,” said he, “what was once your friend and cousin, your\ncounsellor, sage, and guardian. Behold the clay which conducted you\nhither, with the heart neatly but painfully extracted. Look upon a\nwoman’s work, Davy, and shun the sex. I tell you it is better to go\nblindfold through life, to have--pardon me--your own blunt features,\nthan to be reduced to such a pitiable state. Was ever such a refinement\nof cruelty practised before? Never! Was there ever such beauty, such\narchness, such coquetry,--such damned elusiveness? Never! If there is a\ncargo going up the river, let me be salted and lie at the bottom of it.\nI’ll warrant you I’ll not come to life.”\n\n“You appear to have suffered somewhat,” I said, forgetting for the\nmoment in my laughter the thing that weighed upon my mind.\n\n“Suffered!” he cried; “I have been tossed high in the azure that I might\nsink the farther into the depths. I have been put in a grave, the earth\nstamped down, resurrected, and flung into the dust-heap. I have been\ntaken up to the gate of heaven and dropped a hundred and fifty years\nthrough darkness. Since I have seen you I have been the round of all the\nbright places and all the bottomless pits in the firmament.”\n\n“It seems to have made you literary,” I remarked judicially.\n\n“I burn up twenty times a day,” he continued, with a wave of the hand to\nexpress the completeness of the process; “there is nothing left. I see\nher, I speak to her, and I burn up.”\n\n“Have you had many tête-à-têtes?” I asked.\n\n“Not one,” he retorted fiercely; “do you think there is any sense in the\ndamnable French custom? I am an honorable man, and, besides, I am not\nequipped for an elopement. No priest in Louisiana would marry us. I see\nher at dinner, at supper. Sometimes we sew on the gallery,” he went on,\n“but I give you my oath that I have not had one word with her alone.”\n\n“An oath is not necessary,” I said. “But you seem to have made some\nprogress nevertheless.”\n\n“Do you call that progress?” he demanded.\n\n“It is surely not retrogression.”\n\n“God knows what it is,” said Nick, helplessly, “but it’s got to stop. I\nhave sent her an ultimatum.”\n\n“A what?”\n\n“A summons. Her father and mother are going to the Bertrands’ to-night,\nand I have written her a note to meet me in the garden. And you,” he\ncried, rising and slapping me between the shoulders, “you are to keep\nwatch, like the dear, careful, canny, sly rascal you are.”\n\n“And--and has she accepted?” I inquired.\n\n“That’s the deuce of it,” said he; “she has not. But I think she’ll\ncome.”\n\nI stood for a moment regarding him.\n\n“And you really love Mademoiselle Antoinette?” I asked.\n\n“Have I not exhausted the language?” he answered. “If what I have been\nthrough is not love, then may the Lord shield me from the real disease.”\n\n“It may have been merely a light case of--tropical enthusiasm, let\nus say. I have seen others, a little milder because the air was more\ntemperate.”\n\n“Tropical--balderdash,” he exploded. “If you are not the most\nexasperating, unfeeling man alive--”\n\n“I merely wanted to know if you wished to marry Mademoiselle de St.\nGré,” I interrupted.\n\nHe gave me a look of infinite tolerance.\n\n“Have I not made it plain that I cannot live without her?” he said; “if\nnot, I will go over it all again.”\n\n“That will not be necessary,” I said hastily.\n\n“The trouble may be,” he continued, “that they have already made one of\ntheir matrimonial contracts with a Granpré, a Beauséjour, a Bernard.”\n\n“Monsieur de St. Gré is a very sensible man,” I answered. “He loves his\ndaughter, and I doubt if he would force her to marry against her will.\nTell me, Nick,” I asked, laying my hand upon his shoulder, “do you love\nthis girl so much that you would let nothing come between you and her?”\n\n“I tell you, I do; and again I tell you, I do,” he replied. He paused\nsuddenly glancing at my face, and added, “Why do you ask, Davy?”\n\nI stood irresolute, now that the time had come not daring to give voice\nto my suspicions. He had not spoken to me of his mother save that once,\nand I had no means of knowing whether his feeling for the girl might not\nsoften his anger against her. I have never lacked the courage to come\nto the point, but there was still the chance that I might be mistaken in\nthis after all. Would it not be best to wait until I had ascertained in\nsome way the identity of Mrs. Clive? And while I stood debating, Nick\nregarding me with a puzzled expression, Monsieur de St. Gré appeared on\nthe gallery.\n\n“Come, gentlemen,” he cried; “dinner awaits us.”\n\nThe dining room at Les Îles was at the corner of the house, and its\nwindows looked out on the gallery, which was shaded at that place by\ndense foliage. The room, like others in the house, seemed to reflect the\ndecorous character of its owner. Two St. Grés, indifferently painted,\nbut rigorous and respectable, relieved the whiteness of the wall. They\nwere the Commissary-general and his wife. The lattices were closed on\none side, and in the deep amber light the family silver shone but dimly.\nThe dignity of our host, the evident ceremony of the meal,--which was\nattended by three servants,--would have awed into a modified silence at\nleast a less irrepressible person than Nicholas Temple. But Nick was one\nto carry by storm a position which another might wait to reconnoitre.\nThe first sensation of our host was no doubt astonishment, but he was\nsoon laughing over a vivid account of our adventures on the keel boat.\nNick’s imitation of Xavier, and his description of Benjy’s terrors after\nthe storm, were so perfect that I laughed quite as heartily; and\nMadame de St. Gré wiped her eyes and repeated continually, “Quel\ndrôle monsieur! it is thus he has entertained us since thou departed,\nPhilippe.”\n\nAs for Mademoiselle, I began to think that Nick was not far wrong in his\ndiagnosis. Training may have had something to do with it. She would not\nlaugh, not she, but once or twice she raised her napkin to her face and\ncoughed slightly. For the rest, she sat demurely, with her eyes on\nher plate, a model of propriety. Nick’s sufferings became more\ncomprehensible.\n\nTo give the devil his due, Nick had an innate tact which told him when\nto stop, and perhaps at this time Mademoiselle’s superciliousness made\nhim subside the more quickly. After Monsieur de St. Gré had explained to\nme the horrors of the indigo pest and the futility of sugar raising, he\nturned to his daughter.\n\n“‘Toinette, where is Madame Clive?” he asked.\n\nThe girl looked up, startled into life and interest at once.\n\n“Oh, papa,” she cried in French, “we are so worried about her, mamma and\nI. It was the day you went away, the day these gentlemen came, that we\nthought she would take an airing. And suddenly she became worse.”\n\nMonsieur de St. Gré turned with concern to his wife.\n\n“I do not know what it is, Philippe,” said that lady; “it seems to be\nmental. The loss of her husband weighs upon her, poor lady. But this is\nworse than ever, and she will lie for hours with her face turned to the\nwall, and not even Antoinette can arouse her.”\n\n“I have always been able to comfort her before,” said Antoinette, with a\ncatch in her voice.\n\nI took little account of what was said after that, my only notion being\nto think the problem out for myself, and alone. As I was going to my\nroom Nick stopped me.\n\n“Come into the garden, Davy,” he said.\n\n“When I have had my siesta,” I answered.\n\n“When you have had your siesta!” he cried; “since when did you begin to\nindulge in siestas?”\n\n“To-day,” I replied, and left him staring after me.\n\nI reached my room, bolted the door, and lay down on my back to think.\nLittle was needed to convince me now that Mrs. Clive was Mrs. Temple,\nand thus the lady’s relapse when she heard that her son was in the house\nwas accounted for. Instead of forming a plan, my thoughts drifted from\nthat into pity for her, and my memory ran back many years to the text\nof good Mr. Mason’s sermon, “I have refined thee, but not with silver,\nI have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.” What must Sarah Temple\nhave suffered since those days! I remembered her in her prime, in her\nbeauty, in her selfishness, in her cruelty to those whom she might have\nhelped, and I wondered the more at the change which must have come over\nthe woman that she had won the affections of this family, that she had\ngained the untiring devotion of Mademoiselle Antoinette. Her wit might\nnot account for it, for that had been cruel. And something of the agony\nof the woman’s soul as she lay in torment, facing the wall, thinking\nof her son under the same roof, of a life misspent and irrevocable, I\npictured.\n\nA stillness crept into the afternoon like the stillness of night. The\nwide house was darkened and silent, and without a sunlight washed with\ngold filtered through the leaves. There was a drowsy hum of bees, and in\nthe distance the occasional languishing note of a bird singing what must\nhave been a cradle-song. My mind wandered, and shirked the task that was\nset to it.\n\nCould anything be gained by meddling? I had begun to convince myself\nthat nothing could, when suddenly I came face to face with the\nconsequences of a possible marriage between Nick and Mademoiselle\nAntoinette. In that event the disclosure of his mother’s identity would\nbe inevitable. Not only his happiness was involved, but Mademoiselle’s,\nher father’s and her mother’s, and lastly that of this poor hunted woman\nherself, who thought at last to have found a refuge.\n\nAn hour passed, and it became more and more evident to me that I must\nsee and talk with Mrs. Temple. But how was I to communicate with her? At\nlast I took out my portfolio and wrote these words on a sheet:--\n\n“If Mrs. Clive will consent to a meeting with Mr. David Ritchie, he\nwill deem it a favor. Mr. Ritchie assures Mrs. Clive that he makes this\nrequest in all friendliness.”\n\nI lighted a candle, folded the note and sealed it, addressed it to Mrs.\nClive, and opening the latticed door I stepped out. Walking along the\ngallery until I came to the rear part of the house which faced towards\nthe out-buildings, I spied three figures prone on the grass under a\npecan tree that shaded the kitchen roof. One of these figures was Benjy,\nand he was taking his siesta. I descended quietly from the gallery, and\nmaking my way to him, touched him on the shoulder. He awoke and stared\nat me with white eyes.\n\n“Marse Dave!” he cried.\n\n“Hush,” I answered, “and follow me.”\n\nHe came after me, wondering, a little way into the grove, where I\nstopped.\n\n“Benjy,” I said, “do you know any of the servants here?”\n\n“Lawsy, Marse Dave, I reckon I knows ‘em,--some of ‘em,” he answered\nwith a grin.\n\n“You talk to them?”\n\n“Shucks, no, Marse Dave,” he replied with a fine scorn, “I ain’t no hand\nat dat ar nigger French. But I knows some on ‘em, and right well too.”\n\n“How?” I demanded curiously.\n\nBenjy looked down sheepishly at his feet. He was standing pigeon-toed.\n\n“I done c’ressed some on ‘em, Marse Dave,” he said at length, and there\nwas a note of triumph in his voice.\n\n“You did what?” I asked.\n\n“I done kissed one of dem yaller gals, Marse Dave. Yass’r, I done kissed\nM’lisse.”\n\n“Do you think Mélisse would do something for you if you asked her?” I\ninquired.\n\nBenjy seemed hurt.\n\n“Marse Dave--” he began reproachfully.\n\n“Very well, then,” I interrupted, taking the letter from my pocket,\n“there is a lady who is ill here, Mrs. Clive--”\n\nI paused, for a new look had come into Benjy’s eyes. He began that\npeculiar, sympathetic laugh of the negro, which catches and doubles on\nitself, and I imagined that a new admiration for me dawned on his face.\n\n“Yass’r, yass, Marse Dave, I reckon M’lisse ‘ll git it to her ‘thout any\none tekin’ notice.”\n\nI bit my lips.\n\n“If Mrs. Clive receives this within an hour, Mélisse shall have one\npiastre, and you another. There is an answer.”\n\nBenjy took the note, and departed nimbly to find Mélisse, while I paced\nup and down in my uneasiness as to the outcome of the experiment. A\nquarter of an hour passed, half an hour, and then I saw Benjy coming\nthrough the trees. He stood before me, chuckling, and drew from his\npocket a folded piece of paper. I gave him the two piastres, warned him\nif his master or any one inquired for me that I was taking a walk, and\nbade him begone. Then I opened the note.\n\n“I will meet you at the bayou at seven this evening. Take the path that\nleads through the garden.”\n\nI read it with a catch of the breath, with a certainty that the\nhappiness of many people depended upon what I should say at that\nmeeting. And to think of this and to compose myself a little, I made my\nway to the garden in search of the path, that I might know it when the\ntime came. Entering a gap in the hedge, I caught sight of the shaded\nseat under the tree which had been the scene of our first meeting with\nAntoinette, and I hurried past it as I crossed the garden. There were\ntwo openings in the opposite hedge, the one through which Nick and I had\ncome, and another. I took the second, and with little difficulty\nfound the path of which the note had spoken. It led through a dense,\nsemi-tropical forest in the direction of the swamp beyond, the way being\nwell beaten, but here and there jealously crowded by an undergrowth\nof brambles and the prickly Spanish bayonet. I know not how far I had\nwalked, my head bent in thought, before I felt the ground teetering\nunder my feet, and there was the bayou. It was a narrow lane of murky,\nimpenetrable water, shaded now by the forest wall. Imaged on its\namber surface were the twisted boughs of the cypresses of the swamp\nbeyond,--boughs funereally draped, as though to proclaim a warning of\nunknown perils in the dark places. On that side where I stood ancient\noaks thrust their gnarled roots into the water, and these knees were\nbridged by treacherous platforms of moss. As I sought for a safe\nresting-place a dull splash startled me, the pink-and-white water lilies\ndanced on the ripples, and a long, black snout pushed its way to the\ncentre of the bayou and floated there motionless.\n\nI sat down on a wide knee that seemed to be fashioned for the purpose,\nand reflected. It may have been about half-past five, and I made up my\nmind that, rather than return and risk explanations, I would wait where\nI was until Mrs. Temple appeared. I had much to think of, and for the\nrest the weird beauty of the place, with its changing colors as the\nsun fell, held me in fascination. When the blue vapor stole through the\ncypress swamp, my trained ear caught the faintest of warning sounds.\nMrs. Temple was coming.\n\nI could not repress the exclamation that rose to my lips when she stood\nbefore me.\n\n“I have changed somewhat,” she began quite calmly; “I have changed since\nyou were at Temple Bow.”\n\nI stood staring at her, at a loss to know whether by these words she\nsought to gain an advantage. I knew not whether to pity or to be angry,\nsuch a strange blending she seemed of former pride and arrogance and\nlater suffering. There were the features of the beauty still, the\neyes defiant, the lips scornful. Sorrow had set its brand upon this\nprotesting face in deep, violet marks under the eyes, in lines which no\nhuman power could erase: sorrow had flecked with white the gold of the\nhair, had proclaimed her a woman with a history. For she had a new and\nremarkable beauty which puzzled and astonished me,--a beauty in which\nmaternity had no place. The figure, gowned with an innate taste in\nblack, still kept the rounded lines of the young woman, while about the\nshoulders and across the open throat a lace mantilla was thrown. She\nstood facing me, undaunted, and I knew that she had come to fight for\nwhat was left her. I knew further that she was no mean antagonist.\n\n“Will you kindly tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of\nthis--summons, Mr. Ritchie?” she asked. “You are a travelled person for\none so young. I might almost say,” she added with an indifferent laugh,\n“that there is some method and purpose in your travels.”\n\n“Indeed, you do me wrong, Madame,” I replied; “I am here by the merest\nchance.”\n\nAgain she laughed lightly, and stepping past me took her seat on the\noak from which I had risen. I marvelled that this woman, with all\nher self-possession, could be the same as she who had held her room,\ncowering, these four days past. Admiration for her courage mingled with\nmy other feelings, and for the life of me I knew not where to begin. My\nexperience with women of the world was, after all, distinctly limited.\nMrs. Temple knew, apparently by intuition, the advantage she had gained,\nand she smiled.\n\n“The Ritchies were always skilled in dealing with sinners,” she began;\n“the first earl had the habit of hunting them like foxes, so it is said.\nI take it for granted that, before my sentence is pronounced, I shall\nhave the pleasure of hearing my wrong-doings in detail. I could not ask\nyou to forego that satisfaction.”\n\n“You seem to know the characteristics of my family, Mrs. Temple,” I\nanswered. “There is one trait of the Ritchies concerning which I ask\nyour honest opinion.”\n\n“And what is that?” she said carelessly.\n\n“I have always understood that they have spoken the truth. Is it not\nso?”\n\nShe glanced at me curiously.\n\n“I never knew your father to lie,” she answered; “but after all he had\nfew chances. He so seldom spoke.”\n\n“Your intercourse with me at Temple Bow was quite as limited,” I said.\n\n“Ah,” she interrupted quickly, “you bear me that grudge. It is another\ntrait of the Ritchies.”\n\n“I bear you no grudge, Madame,” I replied. “I asked you a question\nconcerning the veracity of my family, and I beg that you will believe\nwhat I say.”\n\n“And what is this momentous statement?” she asked.\n\nI had hard work to keep my temper, but I knew that I must not lose it.\n\n“I declare to you on my honor that my business in New Orleans in no way\nconcerns you, and that I had not the slightest notion of finding you\nhere. Will you believe that?”\n\n“And what then?” she asked.\n\n“I also declare to you that, since meeting your son, my chief anxiety\nhas been lest he should run across you.”\n\n“You are very considerate of others,” she said. “Let us admit for the\nsake of argument that you come here by accident.”\n\nIt was the opening I had sought for, but despaired of getting.\n\n“Then put yourself for a moment in my place, Madame, and give me credit\nfor a little kindliness of feeling, and a sincere affection for your\nson.”\n\nThere was a new expression on her face, and the light of a supreme\neffort in her eyes.\n\n“I give you credit at least for a logical mind,” she answered. “In\nspite of myself you have put me at the bar and seem to be conducting my\ntrial.”\n\n“I do not see why there should be any rancor between us,” I answered.\n“It is true that I hated you at Temple Bow. When my father was killed\nand I was left a homeless orphan you had no pity for me, though your\nhusband was my mother’s brother. But you did me a good turn after all,\nfor you drove me out into a world where I learned to rely upon myself.\nFurthermore, it was not in your nature to treat me well.”\n\n“Not in my nature?” she repeated.\n\n“You were seeking happiness, as every one must in their own way. That\nhappiness lay, apparently, with Mr. Riddle.”\n\n“Ah,” she cried, with a catch of her breath, “I thought you would be\njudging me.”\n\n“I am stating facts. Your son was a sufficient embarrassment in this\nmatter, and I should have been an additional one. I blame you not,\nMrs. Temple, for anything you have done to me, but I blame you for\nembittering Nick’s life.”\n\n“And he?” she said. It seemed to me that I detected a faltering in her\nvoice.\n\n“I will hide nothing from you. He blames you, with what justice I leave\nyou to decide.”\n\nShe did not answer this, but turned her head away towards the bayou. Nor\ncould I determine what was in her mind.\n\n“And now I ask you whether I have acted as your friend in begging you to\nmeet me.”\n\nShe turned to me swiftly at that.\n\n“I am at a loss to see how there can be friendship between us, Mr.\nRitchie,” she said.\n\n“Very good then, Madame; I am sorry,” I answered. “I have done all that\nis in my power, and now events will have to take their course.”\n\nI had not gone two steps into the wood before I heard her voice calling\nmy name. She had risen, and leaned with her hand against the oak.\n\n“Does Nick--know that you are here?” she cried.\n\n“No,” I answered shortly. Then I realized suddenly what I had failed to\ngrasp before,--she feared that I would pity her.\n\n“David!”\n\nI started violently at the sound of my name, at the new note in her\nvoice, at the change in the woman as I turned. And then before I\nrealized what she had done she had come to me swiftly and laid her hand\nupon my arm.\n\n“David, does he hate me?”\n\nAll the hope remaining in her life was in that question, was in her face\nas she searched mine with a terrible scrutiny. And never had I known\nsuch an ordeal. It seemed as if I could not answer, and as I stood\nstaring back at her a smile was forced to her lips.\n\n“I will pay you one tribute, my friend,” she said; “you are honest.”\n\nBut even as she spoke I saw her sway, and though I could not be sure it\nwere not a dizziness in me, I caught her. I shall always marvel at the\ncourage there was in her, for she straightened and drew away from me\na little proudly, albeit gently, and sat down on the knee of the oak,\nlooking across the bayou towards the mist of the swamp. There was the\ninfinite calmness of resignation in her next speech.\n\n“Tell me about him,” she said.\n\nShe was changed indeed. Were it not so I should have heard of her own\nsufferings, of her poor, hunted life from place to place, of countless\nnights made sleepless by the past. Pride indeed was left, but the fire\nhad burned away the last vestige of selfishness.\n\nI sat down beside her, knowing full well that I should be judged by\nwhat I said. She listened, motionless, though something of what that\nnarrative cost her I knew by the current of sympathy that ran now\nbetween us. Unmarked, the day faded, a new light was spread over the\nwaters, the mist was spangled with silver points, the Spanish moss took\non the whiteness of lace against the black forest swamp, and on the\nyellow face of the moon the star-shaped leaves of a gum were printed.\n\nAt length I paused. She neither spoke, nor moved--save for the rising\nand falling of her shoulders. The hardest thing I had to say I saved for\nthe last, and I was near lacking the courage to continue.\n\n“There is Mademoiselle Antoinette--” I began, and stopped,--she turned\non me so quickly and laid a hand on mine.\n\n“Nick loves her!” she cried.\n\n“You know it!” I exclaimed, wondering.\n\n“Ah, David,” she answered brokenly, “I foresaw it from the first. I,\ntoo, love the girl. No human being has ever given me such care and such\naffection. She--she is all that I have left. Must I give her up? Have I\nnot paid the price of my sins?”\n\nI did not answer, knowing that she saw the full cruelty of the\npredicament. What happiness remained to her now of a battered life stood\nsquarely in the way of her son’s happiness. That was the issue, and no\nadvice or aid of mine could change it. There was another silence that\nseemed to me an eternity as I watched, a helpless witness, the struggle\ngoing on within her. At last she got to her feet, her face turned to the\nshadow.\n\n“I will go, David,” she said. Her voice was low and she spoke with a\nsteadiness that alarmed me. “I will go.”\n\nTorn with pity, I thought again, but I could see no alternative. And\nthen, suddenly, she was clinging to me, her courage gone, her breast\nshaken with sobs. “Where shall I go?” she cried. “God help me! Are there\nno remote places where He will not seek me out? I have tried them all,\nDavid.” And quite as suddenly she disengaged herself, and looked at me\nstrangely. “You are well revenged for Temple Bow,” she said.\n\n“Hush,” I answered, and held her, fearing I knew not what, “you have not\nlacked courage. It is not so bad as you believe. I will devise a plan\nand help you. Have you money?”\n\n“Yes,” she answered, with a remnant of her former pride; “and I have an\nannuity paid now to Mr. Clark.”\n\n“Then listen to what I say,” I answered. “To-night I will take you to\nNew Orleans and hide you safely. And I swear to you, whether it be\nright or wrong, that I will use every endeavor to change Nick’s feelings\ntowards you. Come,” I continued, leading her gently into the path, “let\nus go while there is yet time.”\n\n“Stop,” she said, and I halted fearfully. “David Ritchie, you are a good\nman. I can make no amends to you,”--she did not finish.\n\nFeeling for the path in the blackness of the wood, I led her by the\nhand, and she followed me as trustfully as a child. At last, after an\nage of groping, the heavy scents of shrubs and flowers stole to us on\nthe night air, and we came out at the hedge into what seemed a blaze of\nlight that flooded the rows of color. Here we paused, breathless, and\nlooked. The bench under the great tree was vacant, and the garden was\nempty.\n\nIt was she who led the way through the hedge, who halted in the garden\npath at the sound of voices. She turned, but there was no time to flee,\nfor the tall figure of a man came through the opposite hedge, followed\nby a lady. One was Nicholas Temple, the other, Mademoiselle de St.\nGré. Mrs. Temple’s face alone was in the shadow, and as I felt her hand\ntrembling on my arm I summoned all my resources. It was Nick who spoke\nfirst.\n\n“It is Davy!” he cried. “Oh, the sly rascal! And this is the promenade\nof which he left us word, the solitary meditation! Speak up, man; you\nare forgiven for deserting us.”\n\nHe turned, laughing, to Mademoiselle. But she stood with her lips parted\nand her hands dropped, staring at my companion. Then she took two steps\nforward and stopped with a cry.\n\n“Mrs. Clive!”\n\nThe woman beside me turned, and with a supreme courage raised her head\nand faced the girl.\n\n“Yes, Antoinette, it is I,” she answered.\n\nAnd then my eyes sought Nick, for Mrs. Temple had faced her son with a\nmovement that was a challenge, yet with a look that questioned, yearned,\nappealed. He, too, stared, the laughter fading from his eyes, first\nastonishment, and then anger, growing in them, slowly, surely. I shall\nnever forget him as he stood there (for what seemed an age) recalling\none by one the wrongs this woman had done him. She herself had taught\nhim to brook no restraint, to follow impetuously his loves and hates,\nand endurance in these things was moulded in every line of his finely\ncut features. And when he spoke it was not to her, but to the girl at\nhis side.\n\n“Do you know who this is?” he said. “Tell me, do you know this woman?”\n\nMademoiselle de St. Gré did not answer him. She drew near, gently, to\nMrs. Temple, whose head was bowed, whose agony I could only guess.\n\n“Mrs. Clive,” she said softly, though her voice was shaken by a\nprescience, “won’t you tell me what has happened? Won’t you speak to\nme--Antoinette?”\n\nThe poor lady lifted up her arms, as though to embrace the girl, dropped\nthem despairingly, and turned away.\n\n“Antoinette,” she murmured, “Antoinette!”\n\nFor Nick had seized Antoinette by the hand, restraining her.\n\n“You do not know what you are doing?” he cried angrily. “Listen!”\n\nI had stood bereft of speech, watching the scene breathlessly. And now I\nwould have spoken had not Mademoiselle astonished me by taking the lead.\nI have thought since that I might have pieced together this much of her\ncharacter. Her glance at Nick surprised him momentarily into silence.\n\n“I know that she is my dearest friend,” she said, “that she came to us\nin misfortune, and that we love her and trust her. I do not know why she\nis here with Mr. Ritchie, but I am sure it is for some good reason.” She\nlaid a hand on Mrs. Temple’s shoulder. “Mrs. Clive, won’t you speak to\nme?”\n\n“My God, Antoinette, listen!” cried Nick; “Mrs. Clive is not her name. I\nknow her, David knows her. She is an--adventuress!”\n\nMrs. Temple gave a cry, and the girl shot at him a frightened,\nbewildered glance, in which a new-born love struggled with an older\naffection.\n\n“An adventuress!” she repeated, her hand dropping, “oh, I do not believe\nit. I cannot believe it.”\n\n“You shall believe it,” said Nick, fiercely. “Her name is not Clive. Ask\nDavid what her name is.”\n\nAntoinette’s lips moved, but she shirked the question. And Nick seized\nme roughly.\n\n“Tell her,” he said, “tell her! My God, how can I do it? Tell her,\nDavid.”\n\nFor the life of me I could not frame the speech at once, my pity and\na new-found and surprising respect for her making it doubly hard to\npronounce her sentence. Suddenly she raised her head, not proudly, but\nwith a dignity seemingly conferred by years of sorrow and of suffering.\nHer tones were even, bereft of every vestige of hope.\n\n“Antoinette, I have deceived you, though as God is my witness, I thought\nno harm could come of it. I deluded myself into believing that I had\nfound friends and a refuge at last. I am Mrs. Temple.”\n\n“Mrs. Temple!” The girl repeated the name sorrowfully, but perplexedly,\nnot grasping its full significance.\n\n“She is my mother,” said Nick, with a bitterness I had not thought in\nhim, “she is my mother, or I would curse her. For she has ruined my life\nand brought shame on a good name.”\n\nHe paused, his breath catching for very anger. Mrs. Temple hid her face\nin her hands, while the girl shrank back in terror. I grasped him by the\narm.\n\n“Have you no compassion?” I cried. But Mrs. Temple interrupted me.\n\n“He has the right,” she faltered; “it is my just punishment.”\n\nHe tore himself away, and took a step to her.\n\n“Where is Riddle?” he cried. “As God lives, I will kill him without\nmercy!”\n\nHis mother lifted her head again.\n\n“God has judged him,” she said quietly; “he is beyond your vengeance--he\nis dead.” A sob shook her, but she conquered it with a marvellous\ncourage. “Harry Riddle loved me, he was kind to me, and he was a better\nman than John Temple.”\n\nNick recoiled. The fierceness of his anger seemed to go, leaving a more\ndangerous humor.\n\n“Then I have been blessed with parents,” he said.\n\nAt that she swayed, but when I would have caught her she motioned me\naway and turned to Antoinette. Twice Mrs. Temple tried to speak.\n\n“I--I was going away to-night,” she said at length, “and you would never\nhave seen or heard of me more. My nephew David--Mr. Ritchie--whom I\ntreated cruelly as a boy, had pity on me. He is a good man, and he was\nto have taken me away--I do not attempt to defend myself, my dear, but\nI pray that you, who have so much charity, will some day think a little\nkindly of one who has sinned deeply, of one who will love and bless you\nand yours to her dying day.”\n\nShe faltered, and Nick would have spoken had not Antoinette herself\nstayed him with a gesture.\n\n“I wish--my son to know the little there is on my side. It is not much.\nYet God may not spare him the sorrow that brings pity. I--I loved Harry\nRiddle as a girl. My father was ruined, and I was forced into marriage\nwith John Temple for his possessions. He was selfish, overbearing,\ncruel--unfaithful. During the years I lived with him he never once spoke\nkindly to me. I, too, grew wicked and selfish and heedless. My head was\nturned by admiration. Mr. Temple escaped to England in a man-of-war; he\nleft me without a line of warning, of farewell. I--I have wandered\nover the earth, haunted by remorse, and I knew no moment of peace, of\nhappiness, until you brought me here and sheltered and loved me. And\neven here I have had many sleepless hours. A hundred times I have\nsummoned my courage to tell you,--I could not. I am justly punished,\nAntoinette.” She moved a little, timidly, towards the girl, who stood\nmotionless, dazed by what she heard. She held out a hand, appealingly,\nand dropped it. “Good-by, my dear; God will bless you for your kindness\nto an unfortunate outcast.”\n\nShe glanced with a kind of terror in her eyes from the girl to Nick, and\nwhat she meant to say concerning their love I know not, for the flood,\nheld back so long, burst upon her. She wept as I have never seen a woman\nweep. And then, before Nick or I knew what had happened, Antoinette had\ntaken her swiftly in her arms and was murmuring in her ear:--\n\n“You shall not go. You shall not. You will live with me always.”\n\nPresently the sobs ceased, and Mrs. Temple raised her face, slowly,\nwonderingly, as if she had not heard aright. And she tried gently to\npush the girl away.\n\n“No, Antoinette,” she said, “I have done you harm enough.”\n\nBut the girl clung to her strongly, passionately. “I do not care what\nyou have done,” she cried, “you are good now. I know that you are good\nnow. I will not cast you out. I will not.”\n\nI stood looking at them, bewildered and astonished by Mademoiselle’s\nloyalty. She seemed to have forgotten Nick, as had I, and then as I\nturned to him he came towards them. Almost roughly he took Antoinette by\nthe arm.\n\n“You do not know what you are saying,” he cried. “Come away, Antoinette,\nyou do not know what she has done--you cannot realize what she is.”\n\nAntoinette shrank away from him, still clinging to Mrs. Temple. There\nwas a fearless directness in her look which might have warned him.\n\n“She is your mother,” she said quietly.\n\n“My mother!” he repeated; “yes, I will tell you what a mother she has\nbeen to me--”\n\n“Nick!”\n\nIt passes my power to write down the pity of that appeal, the\nhopelessness of it, the yearning in it. Freeing herself from the girl,\nMrs. Temple took one step towards him, her arms held up. I had not\nthought that his hatred of her was deep enough to resist it. It was\nAntoinette whose intuition divined this ere he had turned away.\n\n“You have chosen between me and her,” he said; and before we could get\nthe poor lady to the seat under the oak, he had left the garden. In my\nperturbation I glanced at Antoinette, but there was no other sign in her\nface save of tenderness for Mrs. Temple.\n\nMrs. Temple had mercifully fainted. As I crossed the lawn I saw two\nfigures in the deep shadow beside the gallery, and I heard Nick’s voice\ngiving orders to Benjy to pack and saddle. When I reached the garden\nagain the girl had loosed Mrs. Temple’s gown, and was bending over her,\nmurmuring in her ear.\n\nMany hours later, when the moon was waning towards the horizon, fearful\nof surprise by the coming day, I was riding slowly under the trees on\nthe road to New Orleans. Beside me, veiled in black, her head bowed, was\nMrs. Temple, and no word had escaped her since she had withdrawn herself\ngently from the arms of Antoinette on the gallery at Les Îles. Nick had\ngone long before. The hardest task had been to convince the girl that\nMrs. Temple might not stay. After that Antoinette had busied herself,\nwith a silent fortitude I had not thought was in her, making ready for\nthe lady’s departure. I shall never forget her as she stood, a slender\nfigure of sorrow, looking down at us, the tears glistening on her\ncheeks. And I could not resist the impulse to mount the steps once more.\n\n“You were right, Antoinette,” I whispered; “whatever happens, you will\nremember that I am your friend. And I will bring him back to you if I\ncan.”\n\nShe pressed my hand, and turned and went slowly into the house.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III. LOUISIANA\n\n\nCHAPTER I. THE RIGHTS OF MAN\n\nWere these things which follow to my thinking not extraordinary, I\nshould not write them down here, nor should I have presumed to skip\nnearly five years of time. For indeed almost five years had gone by\nsince the warm summer night when I rode into New Orleans with Mrs.\nTemple. And in all that time I had not so much as laid eyes on my cousin\nand dearest friend, her son. I searched New Orleans for him in vain, and\nlearned too late that he had taken passage on a packet which had dropped\ndown the river the next morning, bound for Charleston and New York.\n\nI have an instinct that this is not the place to relate in detail what\noccurred to me before leaving New Orleans. Suffice it to say that I\nmade my way back through the swamps, the forests, the cane-brakes of the\nIndian country, along the Natchez trail to Nashville, across the barrens\nto Harrodstown in Kentucky, where I spent a week in that cabin which had\nso long been for me a haven of refuge. Dear Polly Ann! She hugged me as\nthough I were still the waif whom she had mothered, and wept over\nthe little presents which I had brought the children. Harrodstown was\nchanged, new cabins and new faces met me at every turn, and Tom, more\ndisgruntled than ever, had gone a-hunting with Mr. Boone far into the\nwilderness.\n\nI went back to Louisville to take up once more the struggle for\npractice, and I do not intend to charge so much as a page with what may\nbe called the even tenor of my life. I was not a man to get into trouble\non my own account. Louisville grew amazingly; white frame houses were\nbuilt, and even brick ones. And ere Kentucky became a State, in 1792, I\nhad gone as delegate to more than one of the Danville Conventions.\n\nAmong the nations, as you know, a storm raged, and the great swells from\nthat conflict threatened to set adrift and wreck the little republic but\nnewly launched. The noise of the tramping of great armies across the\nOld World shook the New, and men in whom the love of fierce fighting was\nborn were stirred to quarrel among themselves. The Rights of Man! How\nmany wrongs have been done under that clause! The Bastille stormed; the\nSwiss Guard slaughtered; the Reign of Terror, with its daily procession\nof tumbrels through the streets of Paris; the murder of that amiable\nand well-meaning gentleman who did his best to atone for the sins of his\nancestors; the fearful months of waiting suffered by his Queen before\nshe, too, went to her death. Often as I lighted my candle of an evening\nin my little room to read of these things so far away, I would drop my\nKentucky Gazette to think of a woman whose face I remembered, to wonder\nsadly whether Hélène de St. Gré were among the lists. In her, I was\nsure, was personified that courage for which her order will go down\neternally through the pages of history, and in my darker moments I\npictured her standing beside the guillotine with a smile that haunted\nme.\n\nThe hideous image of that strife was reflected amongst our own people.\nBudget after budget was hurried by the winds across the sea. And swift\ncouriers carried the news over the Blue Wall by the Wilderness Trail\n(widened now), and thundered through the little villages of the Blue\nGrass country to the Falls. What interest, you will say, could the\npioneer lawyers and storekeepers and planters have in the French\nRevolution? The Rights of Man! Down with kings! General Washington and\nMr. Adams and Mr. Hamilton might sigh for them, but they were not\nfor the free-born pioneers of the West. Citizen was the proper term\nnow,--Citizen General Wilkinson when that magnate came to town,\nresplendent in his brigadier’s uniform. It was thought that Mr.\nWilkinson would plot less were he in the army under the watchful eye of\nhis superiors. Little they knew him! Thus the Republic had a reward for\nadroitness, for treachery, and treason. But what reward had it for the\nlonely, embittered, stricken man whose genius and courage had gained for\nit the great Northwest territory? What reward had the Republic for\nhim who sat brooding in his house above the Falls--for Citizen General\nClark?\n\nIn those days you were not a Federalist or a Democrat, you were an\nAristocrat or a Jacobin. The French parties were our parties; the\nFrench issue, our issue. Under the patronage of that saint of American\nJacobinism, Thomas Jefferson, a Jacobin society was organized in\nPhiladelphia,--special guardians of Liberty. And flying on the March\nwinds over the mountains the seed fell on the black soil of Kentucky:\nLexington had its Jacobin society, Danville and Louisville likewise\ntheir patrons and protectors of the Rights of Mankind. Federalists were\nnot guillotined in Kentucky in the summer of 1793, but I might mention\nmore than one who was shot.\n\nIn spite of the Federalists, Louisville prospered, and incidentally I\nprospered in a mild way. Mr. Crede, behind whose store I still lived,\nwas getting rich, and happened to have an affair of some importance in\nPhiladelphia. Mr. Wharton was kind enough to recommend a young lawyer\nwho had the following virtues: he was neither handsome nor brilliant,\nand he wore snuff-colored clothes. Mr. Wharton also did me the honor to\nsay that I was cautious and painstaking, and had a habit of tiring\nout my adversary. Therefore, in the early summer of 1793, I went to\nPhiladelphia. At that time, travellers embarking on such a journey were\nprayed over as though they were going to Tartary. I was absent from\nLouisville near a year, and there is a diary of what I saw and felt\nand heard on this trip for the omission of which I will be thanked. The\ngreat news of that day which concerns the world--and incidentally this\nstory--was that Citizen Genêt had landed at Charleston.\n\nCitizen Genêt, Ambassador of the great Republic of France to the litle\nRepublic of America, landed at Charleston, acclaimed by thousands, and\nlost no time. Scarcely had he left that city ere American privateers had\nslipped out of Charleston harbor to prey upon the commerce of the hated\nMistress of the Sea. Was there ever such a march of triumph as that of\nthe Citizen Ambassador northward to the capital? Everywhere toasted and\nfeasted, Monsieur Genêt did not neglect the Rights of Man, for\nwithout doubt the United States was to declare war on Britain within\na fortnight. Nay, the Citizen Ambassador would go into the halls of\nCongress and declare war himself if that faltering Mr. Washington\nrefused his duty. Citizen Genêt organized his legions as he went along,\nand threw tricolored cockades from the windows of his carriage. And at\nhis glorious entry into Philadelphia (where I afterwards saw the great\nman with my own eyes), Mr. Washington and his Federal-Aristocrats\ntrembled in their boots.\n\nIt was late in April, 1794, when I reached Pittsburg on my homeward\njourney and took passage down the Ohio with a certain Captain Wendell of\nthe army, in a Kentucky boat. I had known the Captain in Louisville, for\nhe had been stationed at Fort Finney, the army post across the Ohio from\nthat town, and he had come to Pittsburg with a sergeant to fetch down\nthe river some dozen recruits. This was a most fortunate circumstance\nfor me, and in more ways than one. Although the Captain was a gruff and\nblunt man, grizzled and weather-beaten, a woman-hater, he could be a\ndelightful companion when once his confidence was gained; and as we\ndrifted in the mild spring weather through the long reaches between the\npasses he talked of Trenton and Brandywine and Yorktown. There was more\nthan one bond of sympathy between us, for he worshipped Washington,\ndetested the French party, and had a hatred for “filthy Democrats”\nsecond to none I have ever encountered.\n\nWe stopped for a few days at Fort Harmar, where the Muskingum pays\nits tribute to the Ohio, built by the Federal government to hold the\nterritory which Clark had won. And leaving that hospitable place we took\nup our journey once more in the very miracle-time of the spring. The\nsunlight was like amber-crystal, the tall cottonwoods growing by the\nwater-side flaunted a proud glory of green, the hills behind them that\nformed the first great swells of the sea of the wilderness were clothed\nin a thousand sheens and shaded by the purple budding of the oaks and\nwalnuts on the northern slopes. On the yellow sandbars flocks of geese\nsat pluming in the sun, or rose at our approach to cast fleeting shadows\non the water, their honk-honks echoing from the hills. Here and there\na hawk swooped down from the azure to break the surface and bear off a\nwriggling fish that gleamed like silver, and at eventide we would see at\nthe brink an elk or doe, with head poised, watching us as we drifted.\nWe passed here and there a lonely cabin, to set my thoughts wandering\nbackwards to my youth, and here and there in the dimples of the hills\nlittle clusters of white and brown houses, one day to become marts of\nthe Republic.\n\nMy joy at coming back at this golden season to a country I loved was\ntempered by news I had heard from Captain Wendell, and which I had\ndiscussed with the officers at Fort Harmar. The Captain himself had\nbroached the subject one cool evening, early in the journey, as we\nsat over the fire in our little cabin. He had been telling me about\nBrandywine, but suddenly he turned to me with a kind of fierce gesture\nthat was natural to the man.\n\n“Ritchie,” he said, “you were in the Revolution yourself. You helped\nClark to capture that country,” and he waved his hand towards the\nnorthern shore; “why the devil don’t you tell me about it?”\n\n“You never asked me,” I answered.\n\nHe looked at me curiously.\n\n“Well,” he said, “I ask you now.”\n\nI began lamely enough, but presently my remembrance of the young man who\nconquered all obstacles, who compelled all men he met to follow and obey\nhim, carried me strongly into the narrative. I remembered him, quiet,\nself-contained, resourceful, a natural leader, at twenty-five a bulwark\nfor the sorely harried settlers of Kentucky; the man whose clear vision\nalone had perceived the value of the country north of the Ohio to the\nRepublic, who had compelled the governor and council of Virginia to see\nit likewise. Who had guarded his secret from all men, who in the face\nof fierce opposition and intrigue had raised a little army to follow\nhim--they knew not where. Who had surprised Kaskaskia, cowed the tribes\nof the North in his own person, and by sheer force of will drew after\nhim and kept alive a motley crowd of men across the floods and through\nthe ice to Vincennes.\n\nWe sat far into the night, the Captain listening as I had never seen\na man listen. And when at length I had finished he was for a long\ntime silent, and then he sprang to his feet with an oath that woke the\nsleeping soldiers forward and glared at me.\n\n“My God!” he cried, “it is enough to make a man curse his uniform to\nthink that such a man as Wilkinson wears it, while Clark is left to rot,\nto drink himself under the table from disappointment, to plot with the\ndamned Jacobins--”\n\n“To plot!” I cried, starting violently in my turn.\n\nThe Captain looked at me in astonishment.\n\n“How long have you been away from Louisville?” he asked.\n\n“It will be a year,” I answered.\n\n“Ah,” said the Captain, “I will tell you. It is more than a year since\nClark wrote Genêt, since the Ambassador bestowed on him a general’s\ncommission in the army of the French Republic.”\n\n“A general’s commission!” I exclaimed. “And he is going to France?” The\nnation which had driven John Paul Jones from its service was now to lose\nGeorge Rogers Clark!\n\n“To France!” laughed the Captain. “No, this is become France enough.\nHe is raising in Kentucky and in the Cumberland country an army with a\ncursed, high-sounding name. Some of his old Illinois scouts--McChesney,\nwhom you mentioned, for one--have been collecting bear’s meat and\nvenison hams all winter. They are going to march on Louisiana and\nconquer it for the French Republic, for Liberty, Equality--the Rights of\nMan, anything you like.”\n\n“On Louisiana!” I repeated; “what has the Federal government been\ndoing?”\n\nThe Captain winked at me and sat down.\n\n“The Federal government is supine, a laughing-stock--so our friends the\nJacobins say, who have been shouting at Mr. Easton’s tavern all winter.\nNay, they declare that all this country west of the mountains, too,\nwill be broken off and set up into a republic, and allied with that most\nglorious of all republics, France. Believe me, the Jacobins have not\nbeen idle, and there have been strange-looking birds of French plumage\ndodging between the General’s house at Clarksville and the Bear Grass.”\n\nI was silent, the tears almost forcing themselves to my eyes at the\npathetic sordidness of what I had heard.\n\n“It can come to nothing,” continued the Captain, in a changed voice.\n“General Clark’s mind is unhinged by--disappointment. Mad Anthony ¹ is\nnot a man to be caught sleeping, and he has already attended to a little\nexpedition from the Cumberland. Mad Anthony loves the General, as we all\ndo, and the Federal government is wiser than the Jacobins think. It may\nnot be necessary to do anything.” Captain Wendell paused, and looked\nat me fixedly. “Ritchie, General Clark likes you, and you have never\noffended him. Why not go to his little house in Clarksville when you get\nto Louisville and talk to him plainly, as I know you can? Perhaps you\nmight have some influence.”\n\n¹ General Wayne of Revolutionary fame was then in command of that\ndistrict.\n\nI shook my head sadly.\n\n“I intend to go,” I answered, “but I will have no influence.”\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE HOUSE ABOVE THE FALLS\n\nIt was May-day, and shortly after dawn we slipped into the quiet water\nwhich is banked up for many miles above the Falls. The Captain and I sat\nforward on the deck, breathing deeply the sharp odor which comes from\nthe wet forest in the early morning, listening to the soft splash of the\noars, and watching the green form of Eighteen Mile Island as it gently\ndrew nearer and nearer. And ere the sun had risen greatly we had passed\nTwelve Mile Island, and emerging from the narrow channel which divides\nSix Mile Island from the northern shore, we beheld, on its terrace above\nthe Bear Grass, Louisville shining white in the morning sun. Majestic in\nits mile of width, calm, as though gathering courage, the river seemed\nto straighten for the ordeal to come, and the sound of its waters crying\nover the rocks far below came faintly to my ear and awoke memories of a\nday gone by. Fearful of the suck, we crept along the Indian shore until\nwe counted the boats moored in the Bear Grass, and presently above the\ntrees on our right we saw the Stars and Stripes floating from the log\nbastion of Fort Finney. And below the fort, on the gentle sunny slope to\nthe river’s brink, was spread the green garden of the garrison, with its\nsprouting vegetables and fruit trees blooming pink and white.\n\nWe were greeted by a company of buff and blue officers at the landing,\nand I was bidden to breakfast at their mess, Captain Wendell promising\nto take me over to Louisville afterwards. He had business in the town,\nand about eight of the clock we crossed the wide river in one of the\nbarges of the fort and made fast at the landing in the Bear Grass. But\nno sooner had we entered the town than we met a number of country\npeople on horseback, with their wives and daughters--ay, and\nsweethearts--perched up behind them: the men mostly in butternut linsey\nhunting shirts and trousers, slouch hats, and red handkerchiefs stuck\ninto their bosoms; the women marvellously pretty and fresh in stiff\ncotton gowns and Quaker hats, and some in crimped caps with ribbons\nneatly tied under the chin. Before Mr. Easton’s tavern Joe Handy,\nthe fiddler, was reeling off a few bars of “Hey, Betty Martin” to the\nfamiliar crowd of loungers under the big poplar.\n\n“It’s Davy Ritchie!” shouted Joe, breaking off in the middle of the\ntune; “welcome home, Davy. Ye’re jest in time for the barbecue on the\nisland.”\n\n“And Cap Wendell! Howdy, Cap!” drawled another, a huge, long-haired,\nsallow, dirty fellow. But the Captain only glared.\n\n“Damn him!” he said, after I had spoken to Joe and we had passed on, “he\nought to be barbecued; he nearly bit off Ensign Barry’s nose a couple of\nmonths ago. Barry tried to stop the beast in a gouging fight.”\n\nThe bright morning, the shady streets, the homelike frame and log\nhouses, the old-time fragrant odor of corn-pone wafted out of the open\ndoorways, the warm greetings,--all made me happy to be back again.\nMr. Crede rushed out and escorted us into his cool store, and while he\nwaited on his country customers bade his negro brew a bowl of toddy, at\nthe mention of which Mr. Bill Whalen, chief habitué, roused himself from\na stupor on a tobacco barrel. Presently the customers, having indulged\nin the toddy, departed for the barbecue, the Captain went to the fort,\nand Mr. Crede and myself were left alone to talk over the business which\nhad sent me to Philadelphia.\n\nAt four o’clock, having finished my report and dined with my client, I\nset out for Clarksville, for Mr. Crede had told me, among other things,\nthat the General was there. Louisville was deserted, the tavern porch\nvacant; but tacked on the logs beside the door was a printed bill which\ndrew my curiosity. I stopped, caught by a familiar name in large type at\nthe head of it.\n\n   “GEORGE R. CLARK, ESQUIRE,\n\n  “MAJOR-GENERAL IN THE ARMIES OF FRANCE AND COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE\n   FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY LEGION ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.\n\n    “Proposals\n\n“For raising volunteers for the reduction of the Spanish posts on the\nMississippi, for opening the trade of the said river and giving freedom\nto all its inhabitants--”\n\nI had got so far when I heard a noise of footsteps within, and Mr.\nEaston himself came out, in his shirt-sleeves.\n\n“By cricky, Davy,” said he, “I’m right glad ter see ye ag’in. Readin’\nthe General’s bill, are ye? Tarnation, I reckon Washington and all his\nEuropean fellers east of the mountains won’t be able ter hold us back\nthis time. I reckon we’ll gallop over Louisiany in the face of all\nthe Spaniards ever created. I’ve got some new whiskey I ‘low will sink\ntallow. Come in, Davy.”\n\nAs he took me by the arm, a laughter and shouting came from the back\nroom.\n\n“It’s some of them Frenchy fellers come over from Knob Licks. They’re\nin it,” and he pointed his thumb over his shoulder to the proclamation,\n“and thar’s one young American among ‘em who’s a t’arer. Come in.”\n\nI drank a glass of Mr. Easton’s whiskey, and asked about the General.\n\n“He stays over thar to Clarksville pretty much,” said Mr. Easton. “Thar\nain’t quite so much walkin’ araound ter do,” he added significantly.\n\nI made my way down to the water-side, where Jake Landrasse sat alone on\nthe gunwale of a Kentucky boat, smoking a clay pipe as he fished. I\nhad to exercise persuasion to induce Jake to paddle me across, which\nhe finally agreed to do on the score of old friendship, and he declared\nthat the only reason he was not at the barbecue was because he was\nwaiting to take a few gentlemen to see General Clark. I agreed to pay\nthe damages if he were late in returning for these gentlemen, and soon\nhe was shooting me with pulsing strokes across the lake-like expanse\ntowards the landing at Fort Finney. Louisville and the fort were just\nabove the head of the Falls, and the little town of Clarksville, which\nClark had founded, at the foot of them. I landed, took the road that led\nparallel with the river through the tender green of the woods, and as\nI walked the mighty song which the Falls had sung for ages to the\nWilderness rose higher and higher, and the faint spray seemed to be\nwafted through the forest and to hang in the air like the odor of a\nsummer rain.\n\nIt was May-day. The sweet, caressing note of the thrush mingled with the\nmusic of the water, the dogwood and the wild plum were in festal array;\nbut my heart was heavy with thinking of a great man who had cheapened\nhimself. At length I came out upon a clearing where fifteen log houses\nmarked the grant of the Federal government to Clark’s regiment. Perched\non a tree-dotted knoll above the last spasm of the waters in their\ntwo-mile race for peace, was a two-storied log house with a little,\nsquare porch in front of the door. As I rounded the corner of the house\nand came in sight of the porch I halted--by no will of my own--at\nthe sight of a figure sunken in a wooden chair. It was that of my old\nColonel. His hands were folded in front of him, his eyes were fixed but\ndimly on the forests of the Kentucky shore across the water; his hair,\nuncared for, fell on the shoulders of his faded blue coat, and the\nstained buff waistcoat was unbuttoned. For he still wore unconsciously\nthe colors of the army of the American Republic.\n\n“General!” I said.\n\nHe started, got to his feet, and stared at me.\n\n“Oh, it’s--it’s Davy,” he said. “I--I was expecting--some friends--Davy.\nWhat--what’s the matter, Davy?”\n\n“I have been away. I am glad to see you again, General.”\n\n“Citizen General, sir, Major-general in the army of the French Republic\nand Commander-in-chief of the French Revolutionary Legion on the\nMississippi.”\n\n“You will always be Colonel Clark to me, sir,” I answered.\n\n“You--you were the drummer boy, I remember, and strutted in front of the\nregiment as if you were the colonel. Egad, I remember how you fooled the\nKaskaskians when you told them we were going away.” He looked at me, but\nhis eyes were still fixed on the point beyond. “You were always older\nthan I, Davy. Are you married?”\n\nIn spite of myself, I laughed as I answered this question.\n\n“You are as canny as ever,” he said, putting his hand on my shoulder.\n“Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,--they are only possible for the\nbachelor.” Hearing a noise, he glanced nervously in the direction of the\nwoods, only to perceive his negro carrying a pail of water. “I--I was\nexpecting some friends,” he said. “Sit down, Davy.”\n\n“I hope I am not intruding, General,” I said, not daring to look at him.\n\n“No, no, my son,” he answered, “you are always welcome. Did we not\ncampaign together? Did we not--shoot these very falls together on our\nway to Kaskaskia?” He had to raise his voice above the roar of the\nwater. “Faith, well I remember the day. And you saved it, Davy,--you, a\nlittle gamecock, a little worldly-wise hop-o’-my-thumb, eh? Hamilton’s\nscalp hanging by a lock, egad--and they frightened out of their five\nwits because it was growing dark.” He laughed, and suddenly became\nsolemn again. “There comes a time in every man’s life when it grows\ndark, Davy, and then the cowards are afraid. They have no friends whose\nhands they can reach out and feel. But you are my friend. You remember\nthat you said you would always be my friend? It--it was in the fort at\nVincennes.”\n\n“I remember, General.”\n\nHe rose from the steps, buttoned his waistcoat, and straightened himself\nwith an effort. He looked at me impressively.\n\n“You have been a good friend indeed, Davy, a faithful friend,” he said.\n“You came to me when I was sick, you lent me money,”--he waved aside my\nprotest. “I am happy to say that I shall soon be in a position to repay\nyou, to reward you. My evil days are over, and I spurn that government\nwhich spurned me, for the honor and glory of which I founded that\ncity,”--he pointed in the direction of Louisville,--“for the power and\nwealth of which I conquered this Northwest territory. Listen! I am\nnow in the service of a republic where the people have rights, I\nam Commander-in-chief of the French Revolutionary Legion on the\nMississippi. Despite the supineness of Washington, the American nation\nwill soon be at war with Spain. But my friends--and thank God they\nare many--will follow me--they will follow me to Natchez and New\nOrleans,--ay, even to Santa Fé and Mexico if I give the word. The West\nis with me, and for the West I shall win the freedom of the Mississippi.\nFor France and Liberty I shall win back again Louisiana, and then I\nshall be a Maréchal de Camp.”\n\nI could not help thinking of a man who had not been wont to speak of his\nintentions, who had kept his counsel for a year before Kaskaskia.\n\n“I need my drummer boy, Davy,” he said, his face lighting up, “but he\nwill not be a drummer boy now. He will be a trusted officer of high\nrank, mind you. Come,” he cried, seizing me by the arm, “I will write\nthe commission this instant. But hold! you read French,--I remember\nthe day Father Gibault gave you your first lesson.” He fumbled in his\npocket, drew out a letter, and handed it to me. “This is from Citizen\nMichaux, the famous naturalist, the political agent of the French\nRepublic. Read what he has written me.”\n\nI read, I fear in a faltering voice:--\n\n“Citoyen Général:\n\n“Un homme qui a donné des preuves de son amour pour la Liberté et de sa\nhaine pour le despotisme ne devait pas s’adresser en vain au ministre de\nla République française. Général, il est temps que les Américains libres\nde l’Ouest soient débarassés d’un ennemie aussi injuste que méprisable.”\n\nWhen I had finished I glanced at the General, but he seemed not to be\nheeding me. The sun was setting above the ragged line of forest, and a\nblue veil was spreading over the tumbling waters. He took me by the arm\nand led me into the house, into a bare room that was all awry. Maps hung\non the wall, beside them the General’s new commission, rudely framed.\nAmong the littered papers on the table were two whiskey bottles and\nseveral glasses, and strewn about were a number of chairs, the arms\nof which had been whittled by the General’s guests. Across the rough\nmantel-shelf was draped the French tricolor, and before the fireplace on\nthe puncheons lay a huge bearskin which undoubtedly had not been\nshaken for a year. Picking up a bottle, the General poured out generous\nhelpings in two of the glasses, and handed one to me.\n\n“The mists are bad, Davy,” said he; “I--I cannot afford to get the fever\nnow. Let us drink success to the army of the glorious Republic, France.”\n\n“Let us drink first, General,” I said, “to the old friendship between\nus.”\n\n“Good!” he cried. Tossing off his liquor, he set down the glass and\nbegan what seemed a fruitless search among the thousand papers on the\ntable. But at length, with a grunt of satisfaction, he produced a form\nand held it under my eyes. At the top of the sheet was that much-abused\nand calumniated lady, the Goddess of Liberty.\n\n“Now,” he said, drawing up a chair and dipping his quill into an almost\ndepleted ink-pot, “I have decided to make you, David Ritchie, with full\nconfidence in your ability and loyalty to the rights of liberty and\nmankind, a captain in the Legion on the Mississippi.”\n\nI crossed the room swiftly, and as he put his pen to paper I laid my\nhand on his arm.\n\n“General, I cannot,” I said. I had seen from the first the futility of\ntrying to dissuade him from the expedition, and I knew now that it would\nnever come off. I was willing to make almost any sacrifice rather than\noffend him, but this I could not allow. The General drew himself up in\nhis chair and stared at me with a flash of his old look.\n\n“You cannot?” he repeated; “you have affairs to attend to, I take it.”\n\nI tried to speak, but he rode me down.\n\n“There is money to be made in that prosperous town of Louisville.” He\ndid not understand the pain which his words caused me. He rose and laid\nhis hands affectionately on my shoulders. “Ah, Davy, commerce makes a\nman timid. Do you forget the old days when I was the father and you the\nson? Come! I will make you a fortune undreamed of, and you shall be my\nfianancier once more.”\n\n“I had not thought of the money, General,” I answered, “and I have\nalways been ready to leave my business to serve a friend.”\n\n“There, there,” said the General, soothingly, “I know it. I would not\noffend you. You shall have the commission, and you may come when it\npleases you.”\n\nHe sat down again to write, but I restrained him.\n\n“I cannot go, General,” I said.\n\n“Thunder and fury,” cried the General, “a man might think you were a\nweak-kneed Federalist.” He stared at me, and stared again, and rose and\nrecoiled a step. “My God,” he said, “you cannot be a Federalist, you\ncan’t have marched to Kaskaskia and Vincennes, you can’t have been a\nfriend of mine and have seen how the government of the United States has\ntreated me, and be a Federalist!”\n\nIt was an argument and an appeal which I had foreseen, yet which I knew\nnot how to answer. Suddenly there came, unbidden, his own counsel which\nhe had given me long ago, “Serve the people, as all true men should in a\nRepublic, but do not rely upon their gratitude.” This man had bidden me\nremember that.\n\n“General,” I said, trying to speak steadily, “it was you who gave me my\nfirst love for the Republic. I remember you as you stood on the heights\nabove Kaskaskia waiting for the sun to go down, and you reminded me that\nit was the nation’s birthday. And you said that our nation was to be a\nrefuge of the oppressed of this earth, a nation made of all peoples, out\nof all time. And you said that the lands beyond,” and I pointed to the\nWest as he had done, “should belong to it until the sun sets on the sea\nagain.”\n\nI glanced at him, for he was silent, and in my life I can recall no\nsadder moment than this. The General heard, but the man who had spoken\nthese words was gone forever. The eyes of this man before me were fixed,\nas it were, upon space. He heard, but he did not respond; for the\nspirit was gone. What I looked upon was the tortured body from which the\ngenius--the spirit I had worshipped--had fled. I turned away, only to\nturn back in anger.\n\n“What do you know of this France for which you are to fight?” I cried.\n“Have you heard of the thousands of innocents who are slaughtered, of\nthe women and children who are butchered in the streets in the name of\nLiberty? What have those blood-stained adventurers to do with Liberty,\nwhat have the fish-wives who love the sight of blood to do with you that\nwould fight for them? You warned me that this people and this government\nto which you have given so much would be ungrateful,--will the butchers\nand fish-wives be more grateful?”\n\nHe caught only the word grateful, and he rose to his feet with something\nof the old straightness and of the old power. And by evil chance his\neye, and mine, fell upon a sword hanging on the farther wall. Well I\nremembered when he had received it, well I knew the inscription on its\nblade, “Presented by the State of Virginia to her beloved son, George\nRogers Clark, who by the conquest of Illinois and St. Vincennes extended\nher empire and aided in the defence of her liberties.” By evil chance,\nI say, his eye lighted on that sword. In three steps he crossed the room\nto where it hung, snatched it from its scabbard, and ere I could prevent\nhim he had snapped it across his knee and flung the pieces in a corner.\n\n“So much for the gratitude of my country,” he said.\n\nI had gone out on the little porch and stood gazing over the expanse of\nforest and waters lighted by the afterglow. Then I felt a hand upon my\nshoulder, I heard a familiar voice calling me by an old name.\n\n“Yes, General!” I turned wonderingly.\n\n“You are a good lad, Davy. I trust you,” he said. “I--I was expecting\nsome friends.”\n\nHe lifted a hand that was not too steady to his brow and scanned the\nroad leading to the fort. Even as he spoke four figures emerged from the\nwoods,--undoubtedly the gentlemen who had held the council at the inn\nthat afternoon. We watched them in silence as they drew nearer, and then\nsomething in the walk and appearance of the foremost began to bother me.\nHe wore a long, double-breasted, claret-colored redingote that fitted\nhis slim figure to perfection, and his gait was the easy gait of a man\nwho goes through the world careless of its pitfalls. So intently did I\nstare that I gave no thought to those who followed him. Suddenly, when\nhe was within fifty paces, a cry escaped me,--I should have known that\nsmiling, sallow, weakly handsome face anywhere in the world.\n\nThe gentleman was none other than Monsieur Auguste de St. Gré. At\nthe foot of the steps he halted and swept his hand to his hat with a\nmilitary salute.\n\n“Citizen General,” he said gracefully, “we come and pay our respec’s to\nyou and mek our report, and ver’ happy to see you look well. Citoyens,\nVive la République!--Hail to the Citizen General!”\n\n“Vive la République! Vive le Général!” cried the three citizens behind\nhim.\n\n“Citizens, you are very welcome,” answered the General, gravely, as he\ndescended the steps and took each of them by the hand. “Citizens, allow\nme to introduce to you my old friend, Citizen David Ritchie--”\n\n“Milles diables!” cried the Citizen St. Gré, seizing me by the hand,\n“c’est mon cher ami, Monsieur Reetchie. Ver’ happy you have this honor,\nMonsieur;” and snatching his wide-brimmed military cocked hat from his\nhead he made me a smiling, sweeping bow.\n\n“What!” cried the General to me, “you know the Sieur de St. Gré, Davy?”\n\n“He is my guest once in Louisiane, mon général,” Monsieur Auguste\nexplained; “my family knows him.”\n\n“You know the Sieur de St. Gré, Davy?” said the General again.\n\n“Yes, I know him,” I answered, I fear with some brevity.\n\n“Podden me,” said Auguste, “I am now Citizen Captain de St. Gré. And\nyou are also embark in the glorious cause--Ah, I am happy,” he added,\nembracing me with a winning glance.\n\nI was relieved from the embarrassment of denying the impeachment by\nreason of being introduced to the other notables, to Citizen Captain\nSullivan, who wore an undress uniform consisting of a cotton butternut\nhunting shirt. He had charge on the Bear Grass of building the boats for\nthe expedition, and was likewise a prominent member of that august\nbody, the Jacobin Society of Lexington. Next came Citizen Quartermaster\nDepeau, now of Knob Licks, Kentucky, sometime of New Orleans. The\nCitizen Quartermaster wore his hair long in the backwoods fashion; he\nhad a keen, pale face and sunken eyes.\n\n“Ver’ glad mek you known to me, Citizen Reetchie.”\n\nThe fourth gentleman was likewise French, and called Gignoux. The\nCitizen Gignoux made some sort of an impression on me which I did not\nstop to analyze. He was a small man, with a little round hand that\nwriggled out of my grasp; he had a big French nose, bright eyes\nthat popped a little and gave him the habit of looking sidewise, and\ngrizzled, chestnut eyebrows over them. He had a thin-lipped mouth and a\nround chin.\n\n“Citizen Reetchie, is it? I laik to know citizen’s name glorified by\ngran’ cause. Reetchie?”\n\n“Will you enter, citizens?” said the General.\n\nI do not know why I followed them unless it were to satisfy a\ndevil-prompted curiosity as to how Auguste de St. Gré had got there.\nWe went into the room, where the General’s slovenly negro was already\nlighting the candles and the General proceeded to collect and fill six\nof the glasses on the table. It was Citizen Captain Sullivan who gave\nthe toast.\n\n“Citizens,” he cried, “I give you the health of the foremost apostle of\nLiberty in the Western world, the General who tamed the savage tribes,\nwho braved the elements, who brought to their knees the minions of a\ndespot king.” A slight suspicion of a hiccough filled this gap. “Cast\naside by an ungrateful government, he is still unfaltering in his\nallegiance to the people. May he lead our Legion victorious through the\nSpanish dominions.”\n\n“Vive la République!” they shouted, draining their glasses. “Vive le\ncitoyen général Clark!”\n\n“Louisiana!” shouted Citizen Sullivan, warming, “Louisiana, groaning\nunder oppression and tyranny, is imploring us with uplifted hands. To\nthose remaining veteran patriots whose footsteps we followed to this\ndistant desert, and who by their blood and toil have converted it into\na smiling country, we now look. Under your guidance, Citizen General, we\nfought, we bled--”\n\nHow far the Citizen Captain would have gone is problematical. I\nhad noticed a look of disgust slowly creeping into the Citizen\nQuartermaster’s eyes, and at this juncture he seized the Citizen Captain\nand thrust him into a chair.\n\n“Sacré vent!” he exclaimed, “it is the proclamation--he recites the\nproclamation! I see he have participate in those handbill. Poof, the\nworld is to conquer,--let us not spik so much.”\n\n“I give you one toast,” said the little Citizen Gignoux, slyly, “we all\nbring back one wife from Nouvelle Orléans!”\n\n“Ha,” exclaimed the Sieur de St. Gré, laughing, “the Citizen Captain\nDepeau--he has already one wife in Nouvelle Orléans.” ¹\n\n¹ It is unnecessary for the editor to remind the reader that these are\nnot Mr. Ritchie’s words, but those of an adventurer. Mr. Depeau was an\nhonest and worthy gentleman, earnest enough in a cause which was more\nto his credit than to an American’s. According to contemporary evidence,\nMadame Depeau was in New Orleans.\n\nThe Citizen Quartermaster was angry at this, and it did not require\nany great perspicacity on my part to discover that he did not love the\nCitizen de St. Gré.\n\n“He is call in his country, Gumbo de St. Gré,” said Citizen Depeau. “It\nis a deesh in that country. But to beesness, citizens,--we embark on\nglorious enterprise. The King and Queen of France, she pay for her\ntreason with their haids, and we must be prepare’ for do the sem.”\n\n“Ha,” exclaimed the Sieur de St. Gré, “the Citizen Quartermaster will\nlose his provision before his haid.”\n\nThe inference was plain, and the Citizen Quartermaster was quick to take\nit up.\n\n“We are all among frien’s,” said he. “Why I call you Gumbo de St. Gré?\nWhen I come first settle in Louisiane you was wild man--yes. Drink\ntafia, fight duel, spend family money. Aristocrat then. No, I not hold\nmy tongue. You go France and Monsieur le Marquis de St. Gré he get you\nin gardes du corps of the King. Yes, I tell him. You tell the Citizen\nGeneral how come you Jacobin now, and we see if he mek you Captain.”\n\nA murmur of surprise escaped from several of the company, and they all\nstared at the Sieur de St. Gré. But General Clark brought down his\nfist on the table with something of his old-time vigor, and the glasses\nrattled.\n\n“Gentlemen, I will have no quarrelling in my presence,” he cried; “and\nI beg to inform Citizen Depeau that I bestow my commissions where it\npleases me.”\n\nAuguste de St. Gré rose, flushing, to his feet. “Citizens,” he said,\nwith a fluency that was easy for him, “I never mek secret of my\nhistory--no. It is true my relation, Monsieur le Marquis de St. Gré,\nbought me a pair of colors in the King’s gardes du corps.”\n\n“And is it not truth you tremple the coackade, what I hear from\nPhiladelphe?” cried Depeau.\n\nMonsieur Auguste smiled with a patient tolerance.\n\n“If you hev pains to mek inquiry,” said he, “you must learn that I join\nle Marquis de La Fayette and the National Guard. That I have since fight\nfor the Revolution. That I am come now home to fight for Louisiane, as\nMonsieur Genêt will tell you whom I saw in Philadelphe.”\n\n“The Citizen Capitaine--he spiks true.”\n\nAll eyes were turned towards Gignoux, who had been sitting back in his\nchair, very quiet.\n\n“It is true what he say,” he repeated, “I have it by Monsieur Genêt\nhimself.”\n\n“Gentlemen,” said General Clark, “this is beside the question, and I\nwill not have these petty quarrels. I may as well say to you now that\nI have chosen the Citizen Captain to go at once to New Orleans and\norganize a regiment among the citizens there faithful to France. On\naccount of his family and supposed Royalist tendencies he will not be\nsuspected. I fear that a month at least has yet to elapse before our\nexpedition can move.”\n\n“It is one wise choice,” put in Monsieur Gignoux.\n\n“Monsieur le général and gentlemen,” said the Sieur de St. Gré,\ngracefully, “I thank you ver’ much for the confidence. I leave by first\nflatboat and will have all things stir up when you come. The citizens of\nLouisiane await you. If necessair, we have hole in levee ready to cut.”\n\n“Citizens,” interrupted General Clark, sitting down before the ink-pot,\n“let us hear the Quartermaster’s report of the supplies at Knob Licks,\nand Citizen Sullivan’s account of the boats. But hold,” he cried,\nglancing around him, “where is Captain Temple? I heard that he had come\nto Louisville from the Cumberland to-day. Is he not going with you to\nNew Orleans, St. Gré?”\n\nI took up the name involuntarily.\n\n“Captain Temple,” I repeated, while they stared at me. “Nicholas\nTemple?”\n\nIt was Auguste de St. Gré who replied.\n\n“The sem,” he said. “I recall he was along with you in Nouvelle Orléans.\nHe is at ze tavern, and he has had one gran’ fight, and he is ver’--I am\nsorry--intoxicate--”\n\nI know not how I made my way through the black woods to Fort Finney,\nwhere I discovered Jake Landrasse and his canoe. The road was long,\nand yet short, for my brain whirled with the expectation of seeing Nick\nagain, and the thought of this poor, pathetic, ludicrous expedition\ncompared to the sublime one I had known.\n\nGeorge Rogers Clark had come to this!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. LOUISVILLE CELEBRATES\n\n“They have gran’ time in Louisville to-night, Davy,” said Jake\nLandrasse, as he paddled me towards the Kentucky shore; “you hear?”\n\n“I should be stone deaf if I didn’t,” I answered, for the shouting which\ncame from the town filled me with forebodings.\n\n“They come back from the barbecue full of whiskey,” said Jake, “and a\nyoung man at the tavern come out on the porch and he say, ‘Get ready you\nall to go to Louisiana! You been hole back long enough by tyranny.’ Sam\nBarker come along and say he a Federalist. They done have a gran’ fight,\nhe and the young feller, and Sam got licked. He went at Sam just like a\nharricane.”\n\n“And then?” I demanded.\n\n“Them four wanted to leave,” said Jake, taking no trouble to disguise\nhis disgust, “and I had to fetch ‘em over. I’ve got to go back and wait\nfor ‘em now,” and he swore with sincere disappointment. “I reckon there\nain’t been such a jamboree in town for years.”\n\nJake had not exaggerated. Gentlemen from Moore’s Settlement, from\nSullivan’s Station on the Bear Grass,--to be brief, the entire male\npopulation of the county seemed to have moved upon Louisville after the\nbarbecue, and I paused involuntarily at the sight which met my eyes as I\ncame into the street. A score of sputtering, smoking pine-knots threw\na lurid light on as many hilarious groups, and revealed, fantastically\nenough, the boles and lower branches of the big shade trees above them.\nNavigation for the individual, difficult enough lower down, in front of\nthe tavern became positively dangerous. There was a human eddy,--nay, a\nmaelstrom would better describe it. Fights began, but ended abortively\nby reason of the inability of the combatants to keep their feet; one\nman whose face I knew passed me with his hat afire, followed by several\ncompanions in gusts of laughter, for the torch-bearers were careless\nand burned the ears of their friends in their enthusiasm. Another person\nwhom I recognized lacked a large portion of the front of his attire, and\nseemed sublimely unconscious of the fact. His face was badly scratched.\nSeveral other friends of mine were indulging in brief intervals of\nrest on the ground, and I barely avoided stepping on them. Still other\ngentlemen were delivering themselves of the first impressive periods of\norations, only to be drowned by the cheers of their auditors. These were\nthe snatches which I heard as I picked my way onward with exaggerated\nfear:--\n\n“Gentlemen, the Mississippi is ours, let the tyrants who forbid its use\nbeware!” “To hell with the Federal government!” “I tell you, sirs,\nthis land is ours. We have conquered it with our blood, and I reckon no\nSpaniard is goin’ to stop us. We ain’t come this far to stand still.\nWe settled Kaintuck, fit off the redskins, and we’ll march across the\nMississippi and on and on--” “To Louisiany!” they shouted, and the whole\ncrowd would take it up, “To Louisiany! Open the river!”\n\nSo absorbed was I in my own safety and progress that I did not pause\nto think (as I have often thought since) of the full meaning of this,\nthough I had marked it for many years. The support given to Wilkinson’s\nplots, to Clark’s expedition, was merely the outward and visible sign of\nthe onward sweep of a resistless race. In spite of untold privations and\nhardships, of cruel warfare and massacre, these people had toiled over\nthe mountains into this land, and impatient of check or hindrance would,\neven as Clark had predicted, when their numbers were sufficient leap the\nMississippi. Night or day, drunk or sober, they spoke of this thing\nwith an ever increasing vehemence, and no man of reflection who had read\ntheir history could say that they would be thwarted. One day Louisiana\nwould be theirs and their children’s for the generations to come. One\nday Louisiana would be American.\n\nThat I was alive and unscratched when I got as far as the tavern is a\nmarvel. Amongst all the passion-lit faces which surrounded me I could\nget no sight of Nick’s, and I managed to make my way to a momentarily\nquiet corner of the porch. As I leaned against the wall there, trying to\nthink what I should do, there came a great cheering from a little way up\nthe street, and then I straightened in astonishment. Above the cheering\ncame the sound of a drum beaten in marching time, and above that there\nburst upon the night what purported to be the “Marseillaise,” taken up\nand bawled by a hundred drunken throats and without words. Those around\nme who were sufficiently nimble began to run towards the noise, and I\nran after them. And there, marching down the middle of the street at the\nhead of a ragged and most indecorous column of twos, in the centre of\na circle of light cast by a pine-knot which Joe Handy held, was Mr.\nNicholas Temple. His bearing, if a trifle unsteady, was proud, and--if\nI could believe my eyes--around his neck was slung the thing which\nI prized above all my possessions,--the drum which I had carried to\nKaskaskia and Vincennes! He had taken it from the peg in my room.\n\nI shrink from putting on paper the sentimental side of my nature, and\nindeed I could give no adequate idea of my affection for that drum. And\nthen there was Nick, who had been lost to me for five years! My impulse\nwas to charge the procession, seize Nick and the drum together, and drag\nthem back to my room; but the futility and danger of such a course were\napparent, and the caution for which I am noted prevented my undertaking\nit. The procession, augmented by all those to whom sufficient power of\nmotion remained, cheered by the helpless but willing ones on the ground,\nswept on down the street and through the town. Even at this late day\nI shame to write it! Behold me, David Ritchie, Federalist, execrably\nsober, at the head of the column behind the leader. Was it twenty\nminutes, or an hour, that we paraded? This I know, that we slighted no\nstreet in the little town of Louisville. What was my bearing,--whether\nproud or angry or carelessly indifferent,--I know not. The glare of\nJoe Handy’s torch fell on my face, Joe Handy’s arm and that of another\ngentleman, the worse for liquor, were linked in mine, and they saw\nfit to applaud at every step my conversion to the cause of Liberty. We\npassed time and time again the respectable door-yards of my Federalist\nfriends, and I felt their eyes upon me with that look which the angels\nhave for the fallen. Once, in front of Mr. Wharton’s house, Mr. Handy\nburned my hair, apologized, staggered, and I took the torch! And I used\nit to good advantage in saving the drum from capture. For Mr. Temple,\nwith all the will in the world, had begun to stagger. At length, after\nmarching seemingly half the night, they halted by common consent before\nthe house of a prominent Democrat who shall be nameless, and, after some\nminutes of vain importuning, Nick, with a tattoo on the drum, marched\nboldly up to the gate and into the yard. A desperate cunning came to my\naid. I flung away the torch, leaving the head of the column in darkness,\nbroke from Mr. Handy’s embrace, and, seizing Nick by the arm, led him\nonward through the premises, he drumming with great docility. Followed\nby a few stragglers only (some of whom went down in contact with the\ntrees of the orchard), we came to a gate at the back which I knew well,\nwhich led directly into the little yard that fronted my own rooms behind\nMr. Crede’s store. Pulling Nick through the gate, I slammed it, and he\nwas only beginning to protest when I had him safe within my door, and\nthe bolt slipped behind him. As I struck a light something fell to the\nfloor with a crash, an odor of alcohol filled the air, and as the candle\ncaught the flame I saw a shattered whiskey bottle at my feet and a room\nwhich had been given over to carousing. In spite of my feelings I could\nnot but laugh at the perfectly irresistible figure my cousin made, as he\nstood before me with the drum slung in front of him. His hat was gone,\nhis dust-covered clothes awry, but he smiled at me benignly and without\na trace of surprise.\n\n“Sho you’ve come back at lasht, Davy,” he said. “You’re--you’re\nvery--irregular. You’ll lose--law bishness. Y-you’re worse’n Andy\nJackson--he’s always fightin’.”\n\nI relieved him, unprotesting, of the drum, thanking my stars there\nwas so much as a stick left of it. He watched me with a silent and\nexaggerated interest as I laid it on the table. From a distance without\ncame the shouts of the survivors making for the tavern.\n\n“‘Sfortunate you had the drum, Davy,” he said gravely, “‘rwe’d had no\nprocession.”\n\n“It is fortunate I have it now,” I answered, looking ruefully at the\nbattered rim where Nick had missed the skin in his ardor.\n\n“Davy,” said he, “funny thing--I didn’t know you wash a Jacobite. Sh’ou\nhear,” he added relevantly, “th’ Andy Jackson was married?”\n\n“No,” I answered, having no great interest in Mr. Jackson. “Where have\nyou been seeing him again?”\n\n“Nashville on Cumberland. Jackson’sh county sholicitor,--devil of a\nman. I’ll tell you, Davy,” he continued, laying an uncertain hand on\nmy shoulder and speaking with great earnestness, “I had Chicashaw\nhorse--Jackson’d Virginia thoroughbred--had a race--‘n’Jackson wanted\nto shoot me ‘n’I wanted to shoot Jackson. ‘N’then we all went to the Red\nHeifer--”\n\n“What the deuce is the Red Heifer?” I asked.\n\n“‘N’dishtillery over a shpring, ‘n’they blow a horn when the liquor\nrunsh. ‘N’then we had supper in Major Lewish’s tavern. Major Lewis came\nin with roast pig on platter. You know roast pig, Davy?... ‘N’Jackson\npulls out’s hunting knife n’waves it very mashestic.... You know how\nmashestic Jackson is when he--wantshtobe?” He let go my shoulder,\nbrushed back his hair in a fiery manner, and, seizing a knife which\nunhappily lay on the table, gave me a graphic illustration of Mr.\nJackson about to carve the pig, I retreating, and he coming on. “N’when\nhe stuck the pig, Davy,--”\n\nHe poised the knife for an instant in the air, and then, before I could\ninterpose, he brought it down deftly through the head of my precious\ndrum, and such a frightful, agonized squeal filled the room that even I\nshivered involuntarily, and for an instant I had a vivid vision of a pig\nstruggling in the hands of a butcher. I laughed in spite of myself. But\nNick regarded me soberly.\n\n“Funny thing, Davy,” he said, “they all left the room.” For a moment\nhe appeared to be ruminating on this singular phenomenon. Then he\ncontinued: “‘N’Jackson was back firsht, ‘n’he was damned impolite...\n‘n’he shook his fist in my face” (here Nick illustrated Mr. Jackson’s\ngesture), “‘n’he said, ‘Great God, sir, y’have a fine talent, but if\ny’ever do that again, I’ll--I’ll kill you.’  That’sh what he said,\nDavy.”\n\n“How long have you been in Nashville, Nick?” I asked.\n\n“A year,” he said, “lookin’ after property I won rattle-an’-shnap--you\nremember?”\n\n“And why didn’t you let me know you were in Nashville?” I asked, though\nI realized the futility of the question.\n\n“Thought you was--mad at me,” he answered, “but you ain’t, Davy. You’ve\nbeen very good-natured t’ let me have your drum.” He straightened. “I am\nver’ much obliged.”\n\n“And where were you before you went to Nashville?” I said.\n\n“Charleston, ‘Napolis... Philadelphia... everywhere,” he answered.\n\n“Now,” said he, “‘mgoin’ t’ bed.”\n\nI applauded this determination, but doubted whether he meant to carry\nit out. However, I conducted him to the back room, where he sat himself\ndown on the edge of my four-poster, and after conversing a little\nlonger on the subject of Mr. Jackson (who seemed to have gotten upon his\nbrain), he toppled over and instantly fell asleep with his clothes on.\nFor a while I stood over him, the old affection welling up so strongly\nwithin me that my eyes were dimmed as I looked upon his face. Spare and\nhandsome it was, and boyish still, the weaker lines emphasized in its\nrelaxation. Would that relentless spirit with which he had been born\nmake him, too, a wanderer forever? And was it not the strangest of fates\nwhich had impelled him to join this madcap expedition of this other man\nI loved, George Rogers Clark?\n\nI went out, closed the door, and lighting another candle took from my\nportfolio a packet of letters. Two of them I had not read, having found\nthem only on my return from Philadelphia that morning. They were all\nsigned simply “Sarah Temple,” they were dated at a certain number in the\nRue Bourbon, New Orleans, and each was a tragedy in that which it had\nleft unsaid. There was no suspicion of heroics, there was no railing at\nfate; the letters breathed but the one hope,--that her son might come\nagain to that happiness of which she had robbed him. There were in all\nbut twelve, and they were brief, for some affliction had nearly deprived\nthe lady of the use of her right hand. I read them twice over, and\nthen, despite the lateness of the hour, I sat staring at the candles,\nreflecting upon my own helplessness. I was startled from this revery by\na knock. Rising hastily, I closed the door of my bedroom, thinking I\nhad to do with some drunken reveller who might be noisy. The knock was\nrepeated. I slipped back the bolt and peered out into the night.\n\n“I saw dat light,” said a voice which I recognized; “I think I come in\nto say good night.”\n\nI opened the door, and he walked in.\n\n“You are one night owl, Monsieur Reetchie,” he said.\n\n“And you seem to prefer the small hours for your visits, Monsieur de St.\nGré,” I could not refrain from replying.\n\nHe swept the room with a glance, and I thought a shade of disappointment\npassed over his face. I wondered whether he were looking for Nick. He\nsat himself down in my chair, stretched out his legs, and regarded me\nwith something less than his usual complacency.\n\n“I have much laik for you, Monsieur Reetchie,” he began, and waved aside\nmy bow of acknowledgment “Before I go away from Louisville I want to\nspik with you,--this is a risson why I am here. You listen to what dat\nDepeau he say,--dat is not truth. My family knows you, I laik to have\nyou hear de truth.”\n\nHe paused, and while I wondered what revelations he was about to make, I\ncould not repress my impatience at the preamble.\n\n“You are my frien’, you have prove it,” he continued. “You remember las’\ntime we meet?” (I smiled involuntarily.) “You was in bed, but you not\nneed be ashame’ for me. Two days after I went to France, and I not in\nNew Orleans since.”\n\n“Two days after you saw me?” I repeated.\n\n“Yaas, I run away. That was the mont’ of August, 1789, and we have not\nthen heard in New Orleans that the Bastille is attack. I lan’ at\nLa Havre,--it is the en’ of Septembre. I go to the Château de St.\nGré--great iron gates, long avenue of poplar,--big house all ‘round a\ncourt, and Monsieur le Marquis is at Versailles. I borrow three louis\nfrom the concierge, and I go to Versailles to the hotel of Monsieur\nle Marquis. There is all dat trouble what you read about going on, and\nMonsieur le Marquis he not so glad to see me for dat risson. ‘Mon cher\nAuguste,’ he cry, ‘you want to be officier in gardes du corps? You are\nnot afred?’” (Auguste stiffened.) “‘I am a St. Gré, Monsieur le Marquis.\nI am afred of nothings,’ I answered. He tek me to the King, I am made\nlieutenant, the mob come and the King and Queen are carry off to Paris.\nThe King is prisoner, Monsieur le Marquis goes back to the Château de\nSt. Gré. France is a republic. Monsieur--que voulez-vous?” (The Sieur\nde St. Gré shrugged his shoulders.) “I, too, become Republican. I become\nofficier in the National Guard,--one must move with the time. Is it\nnot so, Monsieur? I deman’ of you if you ever expec’ to see a St. Gré a\nRepublican.”\n\nI expressed my astonishment.\n\n“I give up my right, my principle, my family. I come to America--I go to\nNew Orleans where I have influence and I stir up revolution for France,\nfor Liberty. Is it not noble cause?”\n\nI had it on the tip of my tongue to ask Monsieur Auguste why he left\nFrance, but the uselessness of it was apparent.\n\n“You see, Monsieur, I am justify before you, before my frien’s,--that\nis all I care,” and he gave another shrug in defiance of the world\nat large. “What I have done, I have done for principle. If I remain\nRoyalist, I might have marry my cousin, Mademoiselle de St. Gré. Ha,\nMonsieur, you remember--the miniature you were so kin’ as to borrow me\nfour hundred livres?”\n\n“I remember,” I said.\n\n“It is because I have much confidence in you, Monsieur,” he said, “it is\nbecause I go--peut-être--to dangere, to death, that I come here and ask\nyou to do me a favor.”\n\n“You honor me too much, Monsieur,” I answered, though I could scarce\nrefrain from smiling.\n\n“It is because of your charactair,” Monsieur Auguste was good enough to\nsay. “You are to be repose’ in, you are to be rely on. Sometime I think\nyou ver’ ole man. And this is why, and sence you laik objects of art,\nthat I bring this and ask you keep it while I am in dangere.”\n\nI was mystified. He thrust his hand into his coat and drew forth an oval\nobject wrapped in dirty paper, and then disclosed to my astonished eyes\nthe miniature of Mademoiselle de St. Gré,--the miniature, I say, for\nthe gold back and setting were lacking. Auguste had retained only the\nivory,--whether from sentiment or necessity I will not venture. The\nsight of it gave me a strange sensation, and I can scarcely write of the\nanger and disgust which surged over me, of the longing to snatch it from\nhis trembling fingers. Suddenly I forgot Auguste in the lady herself.\nThere was something emblematical in the misfortune which had bereft\nthe picture of its setting. Even so the Revolution had taken from her\na brilliant life, a king and queen, home and friends. Yet the spirit\nremained unquenchable, set above its mean surroundings,--ay, and\nuntouched by them. I was filled with a painful curiosity to know what\nhad become of her, which I repressed. Auguste’s voice aroused me.\n\n“Ah, Monsieur, is it not a face to love, to adore?”\n\n“It is a face to obey,” I answered, with some heat, and with more truth\nthan I knew.\n\n“Mon Dieu, Monsieur, it is so. It is that mek me love--you know not how.\nYou know not what love is, Monsieur Reetchie, you never love laik me.\nYou have not sem risson. Monsieur,” he continued, leaning forward and\nputting his hand on my knee, “I think she love me--I am not sure. I\nshould not be surprise’. But Monsieur le Marquis, her father, he trit me\nver’ bad. Monsieur le Marquis is guillotine’ now, I mus’ not spik evil\nof him, but he marry her to one ol’ garçon, Le Vicomte d’Ivry-le-Tour.”\n\n“So Mademoiselle is married,” I said after a pause.\n\n“Oui, she is Madame la Vicomtesse now; I fall at her feet jus’ the sem.\nI hear of her once at Bel Oeil, the château of Monsieur le Prince\nde Ligne in Flander’. After that they go I know not where. They are\nexile’,--los’ to me.” He sighed, and held out the miniature to me.\n“Monsieur, I esk you favor. Will you be as kin’ and keep it for me\nagain?”\n\nI have wondered many times since why I did not refuse. Suffice it to say\nthat I took it. And Auguste’s face lighted up.\n\n“I am a thousan’ times gret’ful,” he cried; and added, as though with\nan afterthought, “Monsieur, would you be so kin’ as to borrow me fif’\ndollars?”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. OF A SUDDEN RESOLUTION\n\n\nIt was nearly morning when I fell asleep in my chair, from sheer\nexhaustion, for the day before had been a hard one, even for me. I awoke\nwith a start, and sat for some minutes trying to collect my scattered\nsenses. The sun streamed in at my open door, the birds hopped on the\nlawn, and the various sounds of the bustling life of the little town\ncame to me from beyond. Suddenly, with a glimmering of the mad events of\nthe night, I stood up, walked uncertainly into the back room, and stared\nat the bed.\n\nIt was empty. I went back into the outer room; my eye wandered from the\nshattered whiskey bottle, which was still on the floor, to the table\nlittered with Mrs. Temple’s letters. And there, in the midst of them,\nlay a note addressed with my name in a big, unformed hand. I opened it\nmechanically.\n\n“Dear Davy,”--so it ran,--“I have gone away, I cannot tell you where.\nSome day I will come back and you will forgive me. God bless you! NICK.”\n\nHe had gone away! To New Orleans? I had long ceased trying to account\nfor Nick’s actions, but the more I reflected, the more incredible it\nseemed to me that he should have gone there, of all places. And yet I\nhad had it from Clark’s own lips (indiscreet enough now!) that Nick and\nSt. Gré were to prepare the way for an insurrection there. My thoughts\nran on to other possibilities; would he see his mother? But he had no\nreason to know that Mrs. Temple was still in New Orleans. Then my glance\nfell on her letters, lying open on the table. Had he read them? I put\nthis down as improbable, for he was a man who held strictly to a point\nof honor.\n\nAnd then there was Antoinette de St. Gré! I ceased to conjecture here,\ndashed some water in my eyes, pulled myself together, and, seizing\nmy hat, hurried out into the street. I made a sufficiently indecorous\nfigure as I ran towards the water-side, barely nodding to my\nacquaintances on the way. It was a fresh morning, a river breeze stirred\nthe waters of the Bear Grass, and as I stood, scanning the line of boats\nthere, I heard footsteps behind me. I turned to confront a little man\nwith grizzled, chestnut eyebrows. He was none other than the Citizen\nGignoux.\n\n“You tek ze air, Monsieur Reetchie?” said he. “You look for some one,\nyes? You git up too late see him off.”\n\nI made a swift resolve never to quibble with this man.\n\n“So Mr. Temple has gone to New Orleans with the Sieur de St. Gré,” I\nsaid.\n\nCitizen Gignoux laid a fat finger on one side of his great nose. The\nnose was red and shiny, I remember, and glistened in the sunlight.\n\n“Ah,” said he, “‘tis no use tryin’ hide from you. However, Monsieur\nReetchie, you are the ver’ soul of honor. And then your frien’! I know\nyou not betray the Sieur de St. Gré. He is ver’ fon’ of you.”\n\n“Betray!” I exclaimed; “there is no question of betrayal. As far as I\ncan see, your plans are carried on openly, with a fine contempt for the\nFederal government.”\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n“‘Tis not my doin’,” he said, “but I am--what you call it?--a cipher.\nSicrecy is what I believe. But drink too much, talk too much--is it not\nso, Monsieur? And if Monsieur le Baron de Carondelet, ze governor,\nhear they are in New Orleans, I think they go to Havana or Brazil.”\nHe smiled, but perhaps the expression of my face caused him to sober\nabruptly. “It is necessair for the cause. We must have good Revolution\nin Louisiane.”\n\nA suspicion of this man came over me, for a childlike simplicity\ncharacterized the other ringleaders in this expedition. Clark had had\nacumen once, and lost it; St. Gré was a fool; Nick Temple was leading\npurposely a reckless life; the Citizens Sullivan and Depeau had, to say\nthe least, a limited knowledge of affairs. All of these were responding\nmore or less sincerely to the cry of the people of Kentucky (every day\nmore passionate) that something be done about Louisiana. But Gignoux\nseemed of a different feather. Moreover, he had been too shrewd to deny\nwhat Colonel Clark would have denied in a soberer moment,--that St. Gré\nand Nick had gone to New Orleans.\n\n“You not spik, Monsieur. You not think they have success. You are not\nFederalist, no, for I hear you march las’ night with your frien’,--I\nhear you wave torch.”\n\n“You make it your business to hear a great deal, Monsieur Gignoux,” I\nretorted, my temper slipping a little.\n\nHe hastened to apologize.\n\n“Mille pardons, Monsieur,” he said; “I see you are Federalist--but\ndrunk. Is it not so? Monsieur, you tink this ver’ silly thing--this\nexpedition.”\n\n“Whatever I think, Monsieur,” I answered, “I am a friend of General\nClark’s.”\n\n“An enemy of ze cause?” he put in.\n\n“Monsieur,” I said, “if President Washington and General Wayne do not\nthink it worth while to interfere with your plans, neither do I.”\n\nI left him abruptly, and went back to my long-delayed affairs with a\nheavy heart. The more I thought, the more criminally foolish Nick’s\njourney seemed to me. However puerile the undertaking, De Lemos at\nNatchez and Carondelet at New Orleans had not the reputation of sleeping\nat their posts, and their hatred for Americans was well known. I sought\nGeneral Clark, but he had gone to Knob Licks, and in my anxiety I lay\nawake at night, tossing in my bed.\n\nOne evening, perhaps four days after Nick’s departure, I went into\nthe common room of the tavern, and there I was surprised to see an old\nfriend. His square, saffron face was just the same, his little jet eyes\nsnapped as brightly as ever, his hair--which was swept high above his\nforehead and tied in an eelskin behind--was as black as when I had seen\nit at Kaskaskia. I had met Monsieur Vigo many times since, for he was a\nfamiliar figure amongst the towns of the Ohio and the Mississippi,\nand from Vincennes to Anse à la Graisse, and even to New Orleans. His\nreputation as a financier was greater than ever. He was talking to my\nfriend, Mr. Marshall, but he rose when he saw me, with a beaming smile.\n\n“Ha, it is Davy,” he cried, “but not the sem lil drummer boy who would\nnot come into my store. Reech lawyer now,--I hear you make much money\nnow, Davy.”\n\n“Congress money?” I said.\n\nMonsieur Vigo threw out his hands, and laughed exactly as he had done in\nhis log store at Kaskaskia.\n\n“Congress have never repay me one sou,” said Monsieur Vigo, making a\nface. “I have try--I have talk--I have represent--it is no good. Davy,\nit is your fault. You tell me tek dat money. You call dat finance?”\n\n“David,” said Mr. Marshall, sharply, “what the devil is this I hear of\nyour carrying a torch in a Jacobin procession?”\n\n“You may put it down to liquor, Mr. Marshall,” I answered.\n\n“Then you must have had a cask, egad,” said Mr. Marshall, “for I never\nsaw you drunk.”\n\nI laughed.\n\n“I shall not attempt to explain it, sir,” I answered.\n\n“You must not allow your drum to drag you into bad company again,” said\nhe, and resumed his conversation. As I suspected, it was a vigorous\ncondemnation of General Clark and his new expedition. I expressed my\nbelief that the government did not regard it seriously, and would forbid\nthe enterprise at the proper time.\n\n“You are right, sir,” said Mr. Marshall, bringing down his fist on the\ntable. “I have private advices from Philadelphia that the President’s\nconsideration for Governor Shelby is worn out, and that he will issue\na proclamation within the next few days warning all citizens at their\nperil from any connection with the pirates.”\n\nI laughed.\n\n“As a matter of fact, Mr. Marshall,” said I, “Citizen Genêt has been\nliberal with nothing except commissions, and they have neither money nor\nmen.”\n\n“The rascals have all left town,” said Mr. Marshall. “Citizen\nQuartermaster Depeau, their local financier, has gone back to his store\nat Knob Licks. The Sieur de St. Gré and a Mr. Temple, as doubtless you\nknow, have gone to New Orleans. And the most mysterious and therefore\nthe most dangerous of the lot, Citizen Gignoux, has vanished like an\nevil spirit. It is commonly supposed that he, too, has gone down the\nriver. You may see him, Vigo,” said Mr. Marshall, turning to the trader;\n“he is a little man with a big nose and grizzled chestnut eyebrows.”\n\n“Ah, I know a lil ‘bout him,” said Monsieur Vigo; “he was on my boat two\ndays ago, asking me questions.”\n\n“The devil he was!” said Mr. Marshall.\n\nI had another disquieting night, and by the morning I had made up my\nmind. The sun was glinting on the placid waters of the river when I made\nmy way down to the bank, to a great ten-oared keel boat that lay on the\nBear Grass, with its square sail furled. An awning was stretched over\nthe deck, and at a walnut table covered with papers sat Monsieur Vigo,\nsmoking his morning pipe.\n\n“Davy,” said he, “you have come à la bonne heure. At ten I depart for\nNew Orleans.” He sighed. “It is so long voyage,” he added, “and so\nlonely one. Sometime I have the good fortune to pick up a companion, but\nnot to-day.”\n\n“Do you want me to go with you?” I said.\n\nHe looked at me incredulously.\n\n“I should be delighted,” he said, “but you mek a jest.”\n\n“I was never more serious in my life,” I answered, “for I have business\nin New Orleans. I shall be ready.”\n\n“Ha,” cried Monsieur Vigo, hospitably, “I shall be enchant. We will talk\nphilosophe, Beaumarchais, Voltaire, Rousseau.”\n\nFor Monsieur Vigo was a great reader, and we had often indulged in\nconversation which (we flattered ourselves) had a literary turn.\n\nI spent the remaining hours arranging with a young lawyer of my\nacquaintance to look after my business, and at ten o’clock I was aboard\nthe keel boat with my small baggage. At eleven, Monsieur Vigo and I were\ntalking “philosophe” over a wonderful breakfast under the awning, as\nwe dropped down between the forest-lined shores of the Ohio. My host\ntravelled in luxury, and we ate the Creole dishes, which his cook\nprepared, with silver forks which he kept in a great chest in the cabin.\n\nYou who read this may feel something of my impatience to get to New\nOrleans, and hence I shall not give a long account of the journey. What\na contrast it was to that which Nick and I had taken five years before\nin Monsieur Gratiot’s fur boat! Like all successful Creole traders,\nMonsieur Vigo had a wonderful knack of getting on with the Indians, and\noften when we tied up of a night the chief men of a tribe would come\ndown to greet him. We slipped southward on the great, yellow river which\nparted the wilderness, with its sucks and eddies and green islands,\nevery one of which Monsieur knew, and I saw again the flocks of\nwater-fowl and herons in procession, and hawks and vultures wheeling in\ntheir search. Sometimes a favorable wind sprang up, and we hoisted\nthe sail. We passed the Walnut Hills, the Nogales, the moans of the\nalligators broke our sleep by night, and at length we came to Natchez,\nruled over now by that watch-dog of the Spanish King, Gayoso de Lemos.\nThanks to Monsieur Vigo, his manners were charming and his hospitality\ngracious, and there was no trouble whatever about my passport.\n\nOur progress was slow when we came at last to the belvedered plantation\nhouses amongst the orange groves; and as we sat on the wide galleries\nin the summer nights, we heard all the latest gossip of the capital of\nLouisiana. The river was low; there was an ominous quality in the heat\nwhich had its effect, indeed, upon me, and made the old Creoles shake\ntheir heads and mutter a word with a terrible meaning. New Orleans was\na cesspool, said the enlightened. The Baron de Carondelet, indefatigable\nman, aimed at digging a canal to relieve the city of its filth, but\nthis would be the year when it was most needed, and it was not dug. Yes,\nMonsieur le Baron was energy itself. That other fever--the political\none--he had scotched. “Ça Ira” and “La Marseillaise” had been sung in\nthe theatres, but not often, for the Baron had sent the alcaldes to shut\nthem up. Certain gentlemen of French ancestry had gone to languish in\nthe Morro at Havana. Yes, Monsieur de Carondelet, though fat, was on\nhorseback before dawn, New Orleans was fortified as it never had been\nbefore, the militia organized, real cannon were on the ramparts which\ncould shoot at a pinch.\n\nSub rosa, I found much sympathy among the planters with the Rights of\nMan. What had become, they asked, of the expedition of Citizen General\nClark preparing in the North? They may have sighed secretly when I\npainted it in its true colors, but they loved peace, these planters.\nStrangely enough, the name of Auguste de St. Gré never crossed their\nlips, and I got no trace of him or Nick at any of these places. Was it\npossible that they might not have come to New Orleans after all?\n\nThrough the days, when the sun beat upon the awning with a tropical\nfierceness, when Monsieur Vigo abandoned himself to his siestas, I\nthought. It was perhaps characteristic of me that I waited nearly three\nweeks to confide in my old friend the purpose of my journey to New\nOrleans. It was not because I could not trust him that I held my tongue,\nbut because I sought some way of separating the more intimate story of\nNick’s mother and his affair with Antoinette de St. Gré from the rest of\nthe story. But Monsieur Vigo was a man of importance in Louisiana, and\nI reflected that a time might come when I should need his help. One\nevening, when we were tied up under the oaks of a bayou, I told him.\nThere emanated from Monsieur Vigo a sympathy which few men possess, and\nthis I felt strongly as he listened, breaking his silence only at long\nintervals to ask a question. It was a still night, I remember, of great\nbeauty, with a wisp of a moon hanging over the forest line, the air\nheavy with odors and vibrant with a thousand insect tones.\n\n“And what you do, Davy?” he said at length.\n\n“I must find my cousin and St. Gré before they have a chance to get\ninto much mischief,” I answered. “If they have already made a noise, I\nthought of going to the Baron de Carondelet and telling him what I\nknow of the expedition. He will understand what St. Gré is, and I will\nexplain that Mr. Temple’s reckless love of adventure is at the bottom of\nhis share in the matter.”\n\n“Bon, Davy,” said my host, “if you go, I go with you. But I believe ze\nBaron think Morro good place for them jus’ the sem. Ze Baron has been\nmake misérable with Jacobins. But I go with you if you go.”\n\nHe discoursed for some time upon the quality of the St. Gré’s, their\npublic services, and before he went to sleep he made the very just\nremark that there was a flaw in every string of beads. As for me, I went\ndown into the cabin, surreptitiously lighted a candle, and drew from\nmy pocket that piece of ivory which had so strangely come into my\npossession once more. The face upon it had haunted me since I had first\nbeheld it. The miniature was wrapped now in a silk handkerchief which\nPolly Ann had bought for me in Lexington. Shall I confess it?--I had\ncarefully rubbed off the discolorations on the ivory at the back, and\nthe picture lacked now only the gold setting. As for the face, I had a\nkind of consolation from it. I seemed to draw of its strength when I was\ntired, of its courage when I faltered. And, during those four days of\nindecision in Louisville, it seemed to say to me in words that I could\nnot evade or forget, “Go to New Orleans.” It was a sentiment--foolish,\nif you please--which could not resist. Nay, which I did not try to\nresist, for I had little enough of it in my life. What did it matter? I\nshould never see Madame la Vicomtesse d’Ivry-le-Tour.\n\nShe was Hélène to me; and the artist had caught the strength of her\nsoul in her clear-cut face, in the eyes that flashed with wit and\ncourage,--eyes that seemed to look with scorn upon what was mean in the\nworld and untrue, with pity on the weak. Here was one who might have\ngoverned a province and still have been a woman, one who had taken\ninto exile the best of safeguards against misfortune,--humor and an\nindomitable spirit.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE HOUSE OF THE HONEYCOMBED TILES\n\nAs long as I live I shall never forget that Sunday morning of my second\narrival at New Orleans. A saffron heat-haze hung over the river and the\ncity, robbed alike from the yellow waters of the one and the pestilent\nmoisture of the other. It would have been strange indeed if this capital\nof Louisiana, brought hither to a swamp from the sands of Biloxi many\nyears ago by the energetic Bienville, were not visited from time to time\nby the scourge!\n\nAgain I saw the green villas on the outskirts, the verdure-dotted\nexpanse of roofs of the city behind the levee bank, the line of Kentucky\nboats, keel boats and barges which brought our own resistless commerce\nhither in the teeth of royal mandates. Farther out, and tugging\nfretfully in the yellow current, were the aliens of the blue seas,\nhigh-hulled, their tracery of masts and spars shimmering in the heat:\na full-rigged ocean packet from Spain, a barque and brigantine from\nthe West Indies, a rakish slaver from Africa with her water-line dry,\ndischarged but yesterday of a teeming horror of freight. I looked again\nupon the familiar rows of trees which shaded the gravelled promenades\nwhere Nick had first seen Antoinette. Then we were under it, for the\nriver was low, and the dingy-uniformed officer was bowing over our\npassports beneath the awning. We walked ashore, Monsieur Vigo and I,\nand we joined a staring group of keel boatmen and river-men under the\nwillows.\n\nBelow us, the white shell walks of the Place d’Armes were thronged with\ngayly dressed people. Over their heads rose the fine new Cathedral,\nbuilt by the munificence of Don Andreas Almonaster, and beside that the\nmany-windowed, heavy-arched Cabildo, nearly finished, which will stand\nfor all time a monument to Spanish builders.\n\n“It is Corpus Christi day,” said Monsieur Vigo; “let us go and see the\nprocession.”\n\nHere once more were the bright-turbaned negresses, the gay Creole gowns\nand scarfs, the linen-jacketed, broad-hatted merchants, with those of\nsoberer and more conventional dress, laughing and chatting, the children\nplaying despite the heat. Many of these people greeted Monsieur Vigo.\nThere were the saturnine, long-cloaked Spaniards, too, and a greater\nnumber than I had believed of my own keen-faced countrymen lounging\nabout, mildly amused by the scene. We crossed the square, and with the\ncourtesy of their race the people made way for us in the press; and we\nwere no sooner placed ere the procession came out of the church. Flaming\nsoldiers of the Governor’s guard, two by two; sober, sandalled friars\nin brown, priests in their robes,--another batch of color; crosses\nshimmering, tapers emerging from the cool darkness within to pale by the\nlight of day. Then down on their knees to Him who sits high above the\nyellow haze fell the thousands in the Place d’Armes. For here was the\nHost itself, flower-decked in white and crimson, its gold-tasselled\ncanopy upheld by four tonsured priests, a sheen of purple under it,--the\nBishop of Louisiana in his robes.\n\n“The Governor!” whispered Monsieur Vigo, and the word was passed from\nmouth to mouth as the people rose from their knees. François Louis\nHector, Baron de Carondelet, resplendent in his uniform of colonel in\nthe royal army of Spain, his orders glittering on his breast,--pillar of\nroyalty and enemy to the Rights of Man! His eye was stern, his carriage\nerect, but I seemed to read in his careworn face the trials of three\nyears in this moist capital. After the Governor, one by one, the waiting\nAssociations fell in line, each with its own distinguishing sash. So the\nprocession moved off into the narrow streets of the city, the people in\nthe Place dispersed to new vantage points, and Monsieur Vigo signed me\nto follow him.\n\n“I have a frien’, la veuve Gravois, who lives ver’ quiet. She have one\nroom, and I ask her tek you in, Davy.” He led the way through the empty\nRue Chartres, turned to the right at the Rue Bienville, and stopped\nbefore an unpretentious house some three doors from the corner. Madame\nGravois, elderly, wizened, primp in a starched cotton gown, opened the\ndoor herself, fell upon Monsieur Vigo in the Creole fashion; and within\na quarter of an hour I was installed in her best room, which gave out on\na little court behind. Monsieur Vigo promised to send his servant with\nmy baggage, told me his address, bade me call on him for what I wanted,\nand took his leave.\n\nFirst, there was Madame Gravois’ story to listen to as she bustled about\ngiving orders to a kinky-haired negro girl concerning my dinner. Then\ncame the dinner, excellent--if I could have eaten it. The virtues of\nthe former Monsieur Gravois were legion. He had come to Louisiana from\nToulon, planted indigo, fought a duel, and Madame was a widow. So I\ncondense two hours into two lines. Happily, Madame was not proof against\nthe habits of the climate, and she retired for her siesta. I sought my\nroom, almost suffocated by a heat which defies my pen to describe, a\nheat reeking with moisture sucked from the foul kennels of the city. I\nhad felt nothing like it in my former visit to New Orleans. It seemed\nto bear down upon my brain, to clog the power of thought, to make me\nvacillating. Hitherto my reasoning had led me to seek Monsieur de\nSt. Gré, to count upon that gentleman’s common sense and his former\nfriendship. But now that the time had come for it, I shrank from such\na meeting. I remembered his passionate affection for Antoinette, I\nimagined that he would not listen calmly to one who was in some sort\nconnected with her unhappiness. So a kind of cowardice drove me first to\nMrs. Temple. She might know much that would save me useless trouble and\nblundering.\n\nThe shadows of tree-top, thatch, and wall were lengthening as I walked\nalong the Rue Bourbon. Heedless of what the morrow might bring forth,\nthe street was given over to festivity. Merry groups were gathered on\nthe corners, songs and laughter mingled in the court-yards, billiard\nballs clicked in the cabarets. A fat, jolly little Frenchman, surrounded\nby tripping children, sat in his doorway on the edge of the banquette,\nfiddling with all his might, pausing only to wipe the beads of\nperspiration from his face.\n\n“Madame Clive, mais oui, Monsieur, l’ petite maison en face.” Smiling\nbenignly at the children, he began to fiddle once more.\n\nThe little house opposite! Mrs. Temple, mistress of Temple Bow, had come\nto this! It was a strange little home indeed, Spanish, one-story, its\ndormers hidden by a honeycombed screen of terra-cotta tiles. This screen\nwas set on the extreme edge of the roof which overhung the banquette\nand shaded the yellow adobe wall of the house. Low, unpretentious,\nthe latticed shutters of its two windows giving it but a scant air of\nprivacy,--indeed, they were scarred by the raps of careless passers-by\non the sidewalk. The two little battened doors, one step up, were\nclosed. I rapped, waited, and rapped again. The musician across the\nstreet stopped his fiddling, glanced at me, smiled knowingly at the\nchildren; and they paused in their dance to stare. Then one of the\ndoors was pushed open a scant four inches, a scarlet madras handkerchief\nappeared in the crack above a yellow face. There was a long moment of\nsilence, during which I felt the scrutiny of a pair of sharp, black\neyes.\n\n“What yo’ want, Marse?”\n\nThe woman’s voice astonished me, for she spoke the dialect of the\nAmerican tide-water.\n\n“I should like to see Mrs. Clive,” I answered.\n\nThe door closed a shade.\n\n“Mistis sick, she ain’t see nobody,” said the woman. She closed the door\na little more, and I felt tempted to put my foot in the crack.\n\n“Tell her that Mr. David Ritchie is here,” I said.\n\nThere was an instant’s silence, then an exclamation.\n\n“Lan’ sakes, is you Marse Dave?” She opened the door--furtively, I\nthought--just wide enough for me to pass through. I found myself in a\nlow-ceiled, darkened room, opposite a trim negress who stood with her\narms akimbo and stared at me.\n\n“Marse Dave, you doan rec’lect me. I’se Lindy, I’se Breed’s daughter.\nI rec’lect you when you was at Temple Bow. Marse Dave, how you’se done\ngrowed! Yassir, when I heerd from Miss Sally I done comed here to tek\ncyar ob her.”\n\n“How is your mistress?” I asked.\n\n“She po’ly, Marse Dave,” said Lindy, and paused for adequate words. I\ntook note of this darky who, faithful to a family, had come hither to\nshare her mistress’s exile and obscurity. Lindy was spare, energetic,\nforceful--and, I imagined, a discreet guardian indeed for the\nunfortunate. “She po’ly, Marse Dave, an’ she ain’ nebber leabe dis year\nhouse. Marse Dave,” said Lindy earnestly, lowering her voice and\ntaking a step closer to me, “I done reckon de Mistis gwine ter die ob\nlonesomeness. She des sit dar an’ brood, an’ brood--an’ she use’ ter\nde bes’ company, to de quality. No, sirree, Marse Dave, she ain’ nebber\nsesso, but she tink ‘bout de young Marsa night an’ day. Marse Dave?”\n\n“Yes?” I said.\n\n“Marse Dave, she have a lil pink frock dat Marsa Nick had when he was a\nbebby. I done cotch Mistis lookin’ at it, an’ she hid it when she see me\nan’ blush like ‘twas a sin. Marse Dave?”\n\n“Yes?” I said again.\n\n“Where am de young Marsa?”\n\n“I don’t know, Lindy,” I answered.\n\nLindy sighed.\n\n“She done talk ‘bout you, Marse Dave, an’ how good you is--”\n\n“And Mrs. Temple sees no one,” I asked.\n\n“Dar’s one lady come hyar ebery week, er French lady, but she speak\nEnglish jes’ like the Mistis. Dat’s my fault,” said Lindy, showing a\nline of white teeth.\n\n“Your fault,” I exclaimed.\n\n“Yassir. When I comed here from Caroliny de Mistis done tole me not ter\nlet er soul in hyah. One day erbout three mont’s ergo, dis yer lady come\nen she des wheedled me ter let her in. She was de quality, Marse Dave,\nand I was des’ afeard not ter. I declar’ I hatter. Hush,” said Lindy,\nputting her fingers to her lips, “dar’s de Mistis!”\n\nThe door into the back room opened, and Mrs. Temple stood on the\nthreshold, staring with uncertain eyes into the semi-darkness.\n\n“Lindy,” she said, “what have you done?”\n\n“Miss Sally--” Lindy began, and looked at me. But I could not speak for\nlooking at the lady in the doorway.\n\n“Who is it?” she said again, and her hand sought the door-post\ntremblingly. “Who is it?”\n\nThen I went to her. At my first step she gave a little cry and swayed,\nand had I not taken her in my arms I believe she would have fallen.\n\n“David!” she said, “David, is it you? I--I cannot see very well. Why did\nyou not speak?” She looked at Lindy and smiled. “It is because I am an\nold woman, Lindy,” and she lifted her hand to her forehead. “See, my\nhair is white--I shock you, David.”\n\nLeaning on my shoulder, she led me through a little bedroom in the rear\ninto a tiny garden court beyond, a court teeming with lavish colors\nand redolent with the scent of flowers. A white shell walk divided the\ngarden and ended at the door of a low outbuilding, from the chimney of\nwhich blue smoke curled upward in the evening air. Mrs. Temple drew me\nalmost fiercely towards a bench against the adobe wall.\n\n“Where is he?” she said. “Where is he, David?”\n\nThe suddenness of the question staggered me; I hesitated.\n\n“I do not know,” I answered.\n\nI could not look into her face and say it. The years of torment and\nsuffering were written there in characters not to be mistaken. Sarah\nTemple, the beauty, was dead indeed. The hope which threatened to light\nagain the dead fires in the woman’s eyes frightened me.\n\n“Ah,” she said sharply, “you are deceiving me. It is not like you,\nDavid. You are deceiving me. Tell me, tell me, for the love of God,\nwho has brought me to bear chastisement.” And she gripped my arm with a\nstrength I had not thought in her.\n\n“Listen,” I said, trying to calm myself as well as her. “Listen, Mrs.\nTemple.” I could not bring myself to call her otherwise.\n\n“You are keeping him away from me,” she cried. “Why are you keeping him\naway? Have I not suffered enough? David, I cannot live long. I do not\ndare to die--until he has forgiven me.”\n\nI forced her, gently as I might, to sit on the bench, and I seated\nmyself beside her.\n\n“Listen,” I said, with a sternness that hid my feelings, and perforce\nher expression changed again to a sad yearning, “you must hear me. And\nyou must trust me, for I have never pretended. You shall see him if it\nis in my power.”\n\nShe looked at me so piteously that I was near to being unmanned.\n\n“I will trust you,” she whispered.\n\n“I have seen him,” I said. She started violently, but I laid my hand on\nhers, and by some self-mastery that was still in her she was silent. “I\nsaw him in Louisville a month ago, when I returned from a year’s visit\nto Philadelphia.” I could not equivocate with this woman, I could no\nmore lie to her sorrow than to the Judgment. Why had I not foreseen her\nquestion?\n\n“And he hates me?” She spoke with a calmness now that frightened me more\nthan her agitation had done.\n\n“I do not know,” I answered; “when I would have spoken to him he was\ngone.”\n\n“He was drunk,” she said. I stared at her in frightened wonderment. “He\nwas drunk--it is better than if he had cursed me. He did not mention me?\nOr any one?”\n\n“He did not,” I answered.\n\nShe turned her face away.\n\n“Go on, I will listen to you,” she said, and sat immovable through the\nwhole of my story, though her hand trembled in mine. And while I live I\nhope never to have such a thing to go through with again. Truth held me\nto the full, ludicrous tragedy of the tale, to the cheap character of\nmy old Colonel’s undertaking, to the incident of the drum, to the\nconversation in my room. Likewise, truth forbade me to rekindle her\nhope. I did not tell her that Nick had come with St. Gré to New Orleans,\nfor of this my own knowledge was as yet not positive. For a long time\nafter I had finished she was silent.\n\n“And you think the expedition will not get here?” she asked finally, in\na dead voice.\n\n“I am positive of it,” I answered, “and for the sake of those who are\nengaged in it, it is mercifully best that it should not. The day may\ncome,” I added, for the sake of leading her away, “when Kentucky will be\nstrong enough to overrun Louisiana. But not now.”\n\nShe turned to me with a trace of her former fierceness.\n\n“Why are you in New Orleans?” she demanded.\n\nA sudden resolution came to me then.\n\n“To bring you back with me to Kentucky,” I answered. She shook her head\nsadly, but I continued: “I have more to say. I am convinced that neither\nNick nor you will be happy until you are mother and son again. You have\nboth been wanderers long enough.”\n\nOnce more she turned away and fell into a revery. Over the housetop,\nfrom across the street, came the gay music of the fiddler. Mrs. Temple\nlaid her hand gently on my shoulder.\n\n“My dear,” she said, smiling, “I could not live for the journey.”\n\n“You must live for it,” I answered. “You have the will. You must live\nfor it, for his sake.”\n\nShe shook her head, and smiled at me with a courage which was the crown\nof her sufferings.\n\n“You are talking nonsense, David,” she said; “it is not like you. Come,”\n she said, rising with something of her old manner, “I must show you what\nI have been doing all these years. You must admire my garden.”\n\nI followed her, marvelling, along the shell path, and there came\nunbidden to my mind the garden at Temple Bow, where she had once been\nwont to sit, tormenting Mr. Mason or bending to the tale of Harry\nRiddle’s love. Little she cared for flowers in those days, and now they\nhad become her life. With such thoughts in my mind, I listened unheeding\nto her talk. The place was formerly occupied by a shiftless fellow, a\ntailor; and the court, now a paradise, had been a rubbish heap. That\norange tree which shaded the uneven doorway of the kitchen she had found\nhere. Figs, pomegranates, magnolias; the camellias dazzling in their\npurity; the blood-red oleanders; the pink roses that hid the crumbling\nadobe and climbed even to the sloping tiles,--all these had been set\nout and cared for with her own hands. Ay, and the fragrant bed of yellow\njasmine over which she lingered,--Antoinette’s favorite flower.\n\nAntoinette’s flowers that she wore in her hair! In her letters Mrs.\nTemple had never mentioned Antoinette, and now she read the question\n(perchance purposely put there) in my eyes. Her voice faltered sadly.\nScarce a week had she been in the house before Antoinette had found her.\n\n“I--I sent the girl away, David. She came without Monsieur de St. Gré’s\nknowledge, without his consent. It is natural that he thinks me--I will\nnot say what. I sent Antoinette away. She clung to me, she would not go,\nand I had to be--cruel. It is one of the things which make the nights\nlong--so long. My sins have made her life unhappy.”\n\n“And you hear of her? She is not married?” I asked.\n\n“No, she is not married,” said Mrs. Temple, stooping over the jasmines.\nThen she straightened and faced me, her voice shaken with earnestness.\n“David, do you think that Nick still loves her?”\n\nAlas, I could not answer that. She bent over the jasmines again.\n\n“There were five years that I knew nothing,” she continued. “I did not\ndare ask Mr. Clark, who comes to me on business, as you know. It was\nMr. Clark who brought back Lindy on one of his trips to Charleston. And\nthen, one day in March of this year, Madame de Montméry came.”\n\n“Madame de Montméry?” I repeated.\n\n“It is a strange story,” said Mrs. Temple. “Lindy had never admitted any\none, save Mr. Clark. One day early in the spring, when I was trimming my\nroses by the wall there, the girl ran to me and said that a lady wished\nto see me. Why had she let her in? Lindy did not know, she could not\nrefuse her. Had the lady demanded admittance? Lindy thought that I would\nlike to see her. David, it was a providential weakness, or curiosity,\nthat prompted me to go into the front room, and then I saw why Lindy had\nopened the door to her. Who she is or what she is I do not know to this\nday. Who am I now that I should inquire? I know that she is a lady, that\nshe has exquisite manners, that I feel now that I cannot live without\nher. She comes every week, sometimes twice, she brings me little\ndelicacies, new seeds for my garden. But, best of all, she brings me\nherself, and I am always counting the days until she comes again. Yes,\nand I always fear that she, too, will be taken away from me.”\n\nI had not heard the sound of voices, but Mrs. Temple turned, startled,\nand looked towards the house. I followed her glance, and suddenly I knew\nthat my heart was beating.\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. MADAME LA VICOMTESSE\n\nHesitating on the step, a lady stood in the vine-covered doorway, a\nstudy in black and white in a frame of pink roses. The sash at her\nwaist, the lace mantilla that clung about her throat, the deftly coiled\nhair with its sheen of the night waters--these in black. The simple\ngown--a tribute to the art of her countrywomen--in white.\n\nMrs. Temple had gone forward to meet her, but I stood staring,\nmarvelling, forgetful, in the path. They were talking, they were coming\ntowards me, and I heard Mrs. Temple pronounce my name and hers--Madame\nde Montméry. I bowed, she courtesied. There was a baffling light in the\nlady’s brown eyes when I dared to glance at them, and a smile playing\naround her mouth. Was there no word in the two languages to find its way\nto my lips? Mrs. Temple laid her hand on my arm.\n\n“David is not what one might call a ladies’ man, Madame,” she said.\n\nThe lady laughed.\n\n“Isn’t he?” she said.\n\n“I am sure you will frighten him with your wit,” answered Mrs. Temple,\nsmiling. “He is worth sparing.”\n\n“He is worth frightening, then,” said the lady, in exquisite English,\nand she looked at me again.\n\n“You and David should like each other,” said Mrs. Temple; “you are both\ncapable persons, friends of the friendless and towers of strength to the\nweak.”\n\nThe lady’s face became serious, but still there was the expression I\ncould not make out. In an instant she seemed to have scrutinized me with\na precision from which there could be no appeal.\n\n“I seem to know Mr. Ritchie,” she said, and added quickly: “Mrs. Clive\nhas talked a great deal about you. She has made you out a very wonderful\nperson.”\n\n“My dear,” said Mrs. Temple, “the wonderful people of this world are\nthose who find time to comfort and help the unfortunate. That is why you\nand David are wonderful. No one knows better than I how easy it is to be\nselfish.”\n\n“I have brought you an English novel,” said Madame de Montoméry, turning\nabruptly to Mrs. Temple. “But you must not read it at night. Lindy is\nnot to let you have it until to-morrow.”\n\n“There,” said Mrs. Temple, gayly, to me, “Madame is not happy unless she\nis controlling some one, and I am a rebellious subject.”\n\n“You have not been taking care of yourself,” said Madame. She glanced at\nme, and bit her lips, as though guessing the emotion which my visit\nhad caused. “Listen,” she said, “the vesper bells! You must go into the\nhouse, and Mr. Ritchie and I must leave you.”\n\nShe took Mrs. Temple by the arm and led her, unresisting, along the\npath. I followed, a thousand thoughts and conjectures spinning in my\nbrain. They reached the bench under the little tree beside the door, and\nstood talking for a moment of the routine of Mrs. Temple’s life. Madame,\nit seemed, had prescribed a regimen, and meant to have it followed.\nSuddenly I saw Mrs. Temple take the lady’s arm, and sink down upon\nthe bench. Then we were both beside her, bending over her, she sitting\nupright and smiling at us.\n\n“It is nothing,” she said; “I am so easily tired.”\n\nHer lips were ashen, and her breath came quickly. Madame acted with that\ninstant promptness which I expected of her.\n\n“You must carry her in, Mr. Ritchie,” she said quietly.\n\n“No, it is only momentary, David,” said Mrs. Temple. I remember how\npitifully frail and light she was as I picked her up and followed Madame\nthrough the doorway into the little bedroom. I laid Mrs. Temple on the\nbed.\n\n“Send Lindy here,” said Madame.\n\nLindy was in the front room with the negress whom Madame had brought\nwith her. They were not talking. I supposed then this was because Lindy\ndid not speak French. I did not know that Madame de Montméry’s maid was\na mute. Both of them went into the bedroom, and I was left alone.\nThe door and windows were closed, and a green myrtle-berry candle was\nburning on the table. I looked about me with astonishment. But for the\nlow ceiling and the wide cypress puncheons of the floor the room might\nhave been a budoir in a manor-house. On the slender-legged, polished\nmahogany table lay books in tasteful bindings; a diamond-paned bookcase\nstood in the corner; a fauteuil and various other chairs which might\nhave come from the hands of an Adam were ranged about. Tall silver\ncandlesticks graced each end of the little mantel-shelf, and between\nthem were two Lowestoft vases having the Temple coat of arms.\n\nIt might have been half an hour that I waited, now pacing the floor, now\nthrowing myself into the arm-chair by the fireplace. Anxiety for Mrs.\nTemple, problems that lost themselves in a dozen conjectures, all\nidle--these agitated me almost beyond my power of self-control. Once I\nfelt for the miniature, took it out, and put it back without looking at\nit. At last I was startled to my feet by the opening of the door, and\nMadame de Montméry came in. She closed the door softly behind her, with\nthe deft quickness and decision of movement which a sixth sense had told\nme she possessed, crossed the room swiftly, and stood confronting me.\n\n“She is easy again, now,” she said simply. “It is one of her attacks. I\nwish you might have seen me before you told her what you had to say to\nher.”\n\n“I wish indeed that I had known you were here.”\n\nShe ignored this, whether intentionally, I know not.\n\n“It is her heart, poor lady! I am afraid she cannot live long.” She\nseated herself in one of the straight chairs. “Sit down, Mr. Ritchie,”\n she said; “I am glad you waited. I wanted to talk with you.”\n\n“I thought that you might, Madame la Vicomtesse,” I answered.\n\nShe made no gesture, either of surprise or displeasure.\n\n“So you knew,” she said quietly.\n\n“I knew you the moment you appeared in the doorway,” I replied. It was\nnot just what I meant to say.\n\nThere flashed over her face that expression of the miniature, the mouth\nrepressing the laughter in the brown eyes.\n\n“Montméry is one of my husband’s places,” she said. “When Antoinette\nasked me to come here and watch over Mrs. Temple, I chose the name.”\n\n“And Mrs. Temple has never suspected you?”\n\n“I think not. She thinks I came at Mr. Clark’s request. And being a\nlady, she does not ask questions. She accepts me for what I appear to\nbe.”\n\nIt seemed so strange to me to be talking here in New Orleans, in this\nlittle Spanish house, with a French vicomtesse brought up near the court\nof the unfortunate Marie Antoinette; nay, with Hélène de St. Gré, whose\nportrait had twice come into my life by a kind of strange fatality\n(and was at that moment in my pocket), that I could scarce maintain\nmy self-possession in her presence. I had given the portrait, too,\nattributes and a character, and I found myself watching the lady with\na breathless interest lest she should fail in any of these. In the\nintimacy of the little room I felt as if I had known her always, and\nagain, that she was as distant from me and my life as the court from\nwhich she had come. I found myself glancing continually at her face, on\nwhich the candle-light shone. The Vicomtesse might have been four and\ntwenty. Save for the soberer gown she wore, she seemed scarce older than\nthe young girl in the miniature who had the presence of a woman of the\nworld. Suddenly I discovered with a flush that she was looking at me\nintently, without embarrassment, but with an expression that seemed\nto hint of humor in the situation. To my astonishment, she laughed a\nlittle.\n\n“You are a very odd person, Mr. Ritchie,” she said. “I have heard so\nmuch of you from Mrs. Temple, from Antoinette, that I know something of\nyour strange life. After all,” she added with a trace of sadness, “it\nhas been no stranger than my own. First I will answer your questions,\nand then I shall ask some.”\n\n“But I have asked no questions, Madame la Vicomtesse,” I said.\n\n“And you are a very simple person, Mr. Ritchie,” continued Madame la\nVicomtesse, smiling; “it is what I had been led to suppose. A serious\nperson. As the friend of Mr. Nicholas Temple, as the relation and (may\nI say?) benefactor of this poor lady here, it is fitting that you should\nknow certain things. I will not weary you with the reasons and events\nwhich led to my coming from Europe to New Orleans, except to say that I,\nlike all of my class who have escaped the horrors of the Revolution, am\na wanderer, and grateful to Monsieur de St. Gré for the shelter he gives\nme. His letter reached me in England, and I arrived three months ago.”\n\nShe hesitated--nay, I should rather say paused, for there was little\nhesitation in what she did. She paused, as though weighing what she was\nto say next.\n\n“When I came to Les Îles I saw that there was a sorrow weighing upon\nthe family; and it took no great astuteness on my part, Mr. Ritchie,\nto discover that Antoinette was the cause of it. One has only to see\nAntoinette to love her. I wondered why she had not married. And yet I\nsaw that there had been an affair. It seemed very strange to me, Mr.\nRitchie, for with us, you understand, marriages are arranged. Antoinette\nreally has beauty, she is the daughter of a man of importance in the\ncolony, her strength of character saves her from being listless. I found\na girl with originality of expression, with a sense of the fitness of\nthings, devoted to charitable works, who had not taken the veil. That\nwas on her father’s account. As you know, they are inseparable. Monsieur\nPhilippe de St. Gré is a remarkable man, with certain vigorous ideas\nnot in accordance with the customs of his neighbors. It was he who first\nconfided in me that he would not force Antoinette to marry; it was she,\nat length, who told me the story of Nicholas Temple and his mother.” She\npaused again, and, reading between the lines, I perceived that Madame la\nVicomtesse had become essential to the household at Les Îles. Philippe\nde St. Gré was not a man to misplace a confidence.\n\n“It was then that I first heard of you, Mr. Ritchie, and of the part\nwhich you played in that affair. It was then I had my first real insight\ninto Antoinette’s character. Her affection for Mrs. Temple astonished\nme, bewildered me. The woman had deceived her and her family, and yet\nAntoinette gave up her lover because he would not take his mother\nback. Had Mrs. Temple been willing to return to Les Îles after you had\nprovidentially taken her away, they would have received her. Philippe de\nSt. Gré is not a man to listen to criticism. As it was, Antoinette did\nnot rest until she found where Mrs. Temple had hidden herself, and then\nshe came here to her. It is not for us to judge any of them. In sending\nAntoinette away the poor lady denied herself the only consolation that\nwas left to her. Antoinette understood. Every week she has had news of\nMrs. Temple from Mr. Clark. And when I came and learned her trouble,\nAntoinette begged me to come here and be Mrs. Temple’s friend. Mr.\nRitchie, she is a very ill woman and a very sad woman,--the saddest\nwoman I have ever known, and I have seen many.”\n\n“And Mademoiselle de St. Gré?” I asked.\n\n“Tell me about this man for whom Antoinette has ruined her life,” said\nMadame la Vicomtesse, brusquely. “Is he worth it? No, no man is worth\nwhat she has suffered. What has become of him? Where is he? Did you not\ntell her that you would bring him back?”\n\n“I said that I would bring him back if I could,” I answered, “and I\nmeant it, Madame.”\n\nMadame la Vicomtesse bit her lip. Had she known me better, she might\nhave smiled. As for me, I was wholly puzzled to account for these\nfleeting changes in her humor.\n\n“You have taken a great deal upon your shoulders, Mr. Ritchie,” she\nsaid. “They are from all accounts broad ones. There, I was wrong to be\nindignant in your presence,--you who seem to have spent your life in\ntrying to get others out of difficulties. Mercy,” she said, with a quick\ngesture at my protest, “there are few men with whom one might talk thus\nin so short an acquaintance. I love the girl, and I cannot help being\nangry with Mr. Temple. I suppose there is something to be said on his\nside. Let us hear it--I dare say he could not have a better advocate,”\n she finished, with an indefinable smile.\n\nI began at the wrong end of my narrative, and it was some time before I\nhad my facts arranged in proper sequence. I could not forget that Madame\nla Vicomtesse was looking at me fixedly. I reviewed Nick’s neglected\nchildhood; painted as well as I might his temperament and character--his\ngenerosity and fearlessness, his recklessness and improvidence. His\nloyalty to those he loved, his detestation of those he hated. I told\nhow, under these conditions, the sins and vagaries of his parents had\ngone far to wreck his life at the beginning of it. I told how I had\nfound him again with Sevier, how he had come to New Orleans with me\nthe first time, how he had loved Antoinette, and how he had disappeared\nafter the dreadful scene in the garden at Les Îles, how I had not seen\nhim again for five years. Here I hesitated, little knowing how to tell\nthe Vicomtesse of that affair in Louisville. Though I had a sense that I\ncould not keep the truth from so discerning a person, I was startled to\nfind this to be so.\n\n“Yes, yes, I understand,” she said quickly. “And in the morning he had\nflown with that most worthy of my relatives, Auguste de St. Gré.”\n\nI looked at her, finding no words to express my astonishment at this\nperspicacity.\n\n“And now what do you intend to do?” she asked. “Find him in New\nOrleans, if you can, of course. But how?” She rose quickly, went to\nthe fireplace, and stood for a moment with her back to me. Suddenly she\nturned. “It ought not to be difficult, after all. Auguste de St. Gré is\na fool, and he confirms what you say of the expedition. He is, indeed,\na pretty person to choose for an intrigue of this kind. And your\ncousin,--what shall we call him?”\n\n“To say the least, secrecy is not Nick’s forte,” I answered, catching\nher mood.\n\nShe was silent awhile.\n\n“It would be a blessing if Monsieur le Baron could hang Auguste\nprivately. As for your cousin, he may be worth saving, after all. I know\nMonsieur de Carondelet, and he has no patience with conspirators of this\nsort. I think he would not hesitate to make examples of them. However,\nwe will try to save them.”\n\n“We!” I repeated unwittingly.\n\nMadame la Vicomtesse looked at me and laughed outright.\n\n“Yes,” she said, “you will do some things, I others. There are the\ngaming clubs with their ridiculous names, L’Amour, La Mignonne, La\nDésirée” (she counted them reflectively on her fingers). “Both of our\ngentlemen might be tempted into one of these. You will drop into them,\nMr. Ritchie. Then there is Madame Bouvet’s.”\n\n“Auguste would scarcely go there,” I objected.\n\n“Ah,” said Madame la Vicomtesse, “but Madame Bouvet will know the names\nof some of Auguste’s intimates. This Bouvet is evidently a good person,\nperhaps she will do more for you. I understand that she has a weak spot\nin her heart for Auguste.”\n\nMadame la Vicomtesse turned her back again. Had she heard how Madame\nBouvet had begged me to buy the miniature?\n\n“Have you any other suggestions to make?” she said, putting a foot on\nthe fender.\n\n“They have all been yours, so far,” I answered.\n\n“And yet you are a man of action, of expedients,” she murmured, without\nturning. “Where are your wits, Mr. Ritchie? Have you any plan?”\n\n“I have been so used to rely on myself, Madame,” I replied.\n\n“That you do not like to have your affairs meddled with by a woman,” she\nsaid, into the fireplace.\n\n“I give you the credit to believe that you are too clever to\nmisunderstand me, Madame,” I said. “You must know that your help is most\nwelcome.”\n\nAt that she swung around and regarded me strangely, mirth lurking in her\neyes. She seemed about to retort, and then to conquer the impulse. The\neffect of this was to make me anything but self-complacent. She sat down\nin the chair and for a little while she was silent.\n\n“Suppose we do find them,” she said suddenly. “What shall we do with\nthem?” She looked up at me questioningly, seriously. “Is it likely that\nyour Mr. Temple will be reconciled with his mother? Is it likely that he\nis still in love with Antoinette?”\n\n“I think it is likely that he is still in love with Mademoiselle de St.\nGré,” I answered, “though I have no reason for saying so.”\n\n“You are very honest, Mr. Ritchie. We must look at this problem from\nall sides. If he is not reconciled with his mother, Antoinette will not\nreceive him. And if he is, we have the question to consider whether he\nis still worthy of her. The agents of Providence must not be heedless,”\n she added with a smile.\n\n“I am sure that Nick would alter his life if it became worth living,” I\nsaid. “I will answer for that much.”\n\n“Then he must be reconciled with his mother,” she replied with decision.\n“Mrs. Temple has suffered enough. And he must be found before he gets\nsufficiently into the bad graces of the Baron de Carondelet,--these two\nthings are clear.” She rose. “Come here to-morrow evening at the same\ntime.”\n\nShe started quickly for the bedroom door, but something troubled me\nstill.\n\n“Madame--” I said.\n\n“Yes,” she answered, turning quickly.\n\nI did not know how to begin. There were many things I wished to say, to\nknow, but she was a woman whose mind seemed to leap the chasms, whose\nwords touched only upon those points which might not be understood. She\nregarded me with seeming patience.\n\n“I should think that Mrs. Temple might have recognized you,” I said, for\nwant of a better opening.\n\n“From the miniature?” she said.\n\nI flushed furiously, and it seemed to burn me through the lining of my\npocket.\n\n“That was my salvation,” she said. “Mrs. Temple has never seen the\nminiature. I have heard how you rescued it, Mr. Ritchie,” she added,\nwith a curious smile. “Monsieur Philippe de St. Gré told me.”\n\n“Then he knew?” I stammered.\n\nShe laughed.\n\n“I have told you that you are a very simple person,” she said. “Even you\nare not given to intrigues. I thank you for rescuing me.”\n\nI flushed more hotly than before.\n\n“I never expected to see you,” I said.\n\n“It must have been a shock,” she said.\n\nI was dumb. I had my hand in my coat; I fully intended to give her the\nminiature. It was my plain duty. And suddenly, overwhelmed, I remembered\nthat it was wrapped in Polly Ann’s silk handkerchief.\n\nMadame la Vicomtesse remained for a moment where she was.\n\n“Do not do anything until the morning,” she said. “You must go back to\nyour lodgings at once.”\n\n“That would be to lose time,” I answered.\n\n“You must think of yourself a little,” she said. “Do as I say. I have\nheard that two cases of the yellow fever have broken out this afternoon.\nAnd you, who are not used to the climate, must not be out after dark.”\n\n“And you?” I said.\n\n“I am used to it,” she replied; “I have been here three months. Lest\nanything should happen, it might be well for you to give me your\naddress.”\n\n“I am with Madame Gravois, in the Rue Bienville.”\n\n“Madame Gravois, in the Rue Bienville,” she repeated. “I shall remember.\nÀ demain, Monsieur.” She courtesied and went swiftly into Mrs. Temple’s\nroom. Seizing my hat, I opened the door and found myself in the dark\nstreet.\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE DISPOSAL OF THE SIEUR DE ST. GRE\n\n\nI had met Hélène de St. Gré at last. And what a fool she must think me!\nAs I hurried along the dark banquettes this thought filled my brain for\na time to the exclusion of all others, so strongly is vanity ingrained\nin us. After all, what did it matter what she thought,--Madame la\nVicomtesse d’Ivry-le-Tour? I had never shone, and it was rather late to\nbegin. But I possessed, at least, average common sense, and I had given\nno proof even of this.\n\nI wandered on, not heeding the command which she had given me,--to go\nhome. The scent of camellias and magnolias floated on the heavy air of\nthe night from the court-yards, reminding me of her. Laughter and soft\nvoices came from the galleries. Despite the Terror, despite the Faubourg\nSaint-Antoine, despite the Rights of Man and the wars and suffering\narising therefrom, despite the scourge which might come to-morrow, life\nwent gayly on. The cabarets echoed, and behind the tight blinds lines of\nlight showed where the Creole gentry gamed at their tables, perchance in\nthe very clubs Madame la Vicomtesse had mentioned.\n\nThe moon, in her first quarter, floated in a haze. Washed by her light,\nthe quaintly wrought balconies and heavy-tiled roofs of the Spanish\nbuildings, risen from the charred embers, took on a touch of romance.\nI paused once with a twinge of remembrance before the long line of the\nUrsuline convent, with its latticed belfry against the sky. There\nwas the lodge, with its iron gates shut, and the wall which Nick had\nthreatened to climb. As I passed the great square of the new barracks,\na sereno (so the night watchmen were called) was crying the hour. I\ncame to the rambling market-stalls, casting black shadows on the river\nroad,--empty now, to be filled in the morning with shouting marchands.\nThe promenade under the willows was deserted, the great river stretched\naway under the moon towards the forest line of the farther shore,\nfilmy and indistinct. A black wisp of smoke rose from the gunwale of a\nflatboat, and I stopped to listen to the weird song of a negro, which I\nhave heard many times since.\n\n    CAROLINE. †\n\n  In, dé, tois, Ca-ro-line, Qui ci ça yé, comme\n  ça ma chére? In, dé, tois, Ca-ro-line, Quo\n  fair t’-apés cri--é ma chére? Mo l’-aimé toé to\n  con-né ça, C’est to m’ou--lé, c’est to mo prend, Mo\n  l’-aimé toé, to con-né ca -- a c’est to m’oulé c’est \n  to mo prend.\n\nGaining the promenade, I came presently to the new hotel which had been\nbuilt for the Governor, with its balconied windows looking across the\nriver--the mansion of Monsieur le Baron de Carondelet. Even as I sat on\nthe bench in the shadow of the willows, watching the sentry who paced\nbefore the arched entrance, I caught sight of a man stealing along the\nbanquette on the other side of the road. Twice he paused to look behind\nhim, and when he reached the corner of the street he stopped for some\ntime to survey the Governor’s house opposite.\n\nSuddenly I was on my feet, every sense alert, staring. In the moonlight,\nmade milky by the haze, he was indistinct. And yet I could have taken\noath that the square, diminutive figure, with the head set forward on\nthe shoulders, was Gignoux’s. If this man were not Gignoux, then the\nLord had cast two in a strange mould.\n\nAnd what was Gignoux doing in New Orleans? As if in answer to the\nquestion two men emerged from the dark archway of the Governor’s house,\npassed the sentry, and stood for an instant on the edge of the shadow.\nOne wore a long Spanish cloak, and the other a uniform that I could not\nmake out. A word was spoken, and then my man was ambling across to meet\nthem, and the three walked away up Toulouse Street.\n\nI was in a fire of conjecture. I did not dare to pass the sentry and\nfollow them, so I made round as fast as I could by the Rue St. Pierre,\nwhich borders the Place d’Armes, and then crossed to Toulouse again by\nChartres. The three were nowhere to be seen. I paused on the corner for\nthought, and at length came to a reluctant but prudent conclusion that I\nhad best go back to my lodging and seek Monsieur early in the morning.\n\nMadame Gravois was awaiting me. Was Monsieur mad to remain out at night?\nHad Monsieur not heard of the yellow fever? Madame Gravois even had\nprepared some concoction which she poured out of a bottle, and which I\ntook with the docility of a child. Monsieur Vigo had called, and there\nwas a note. A note? It was a small note. I glanced stupidly at the seal,\nrecognized the swan of the St. Gré crest, broke it, and read:--\n\n“Mr. Ritchie will confer a favor upon la Vicomtesse d’Ivry-le-Tour if he\nwill come to Monsieur de St. Gré’s house at eight to-morrow morning.”\n\nI bade the reluctant Madame Gravois good night, gained my room, threw\noff my clothes, and covered myself with the mosquito bar. There was no\nquestion of sleep, for the events of the day and surmises for the morrow\ntortured me as I tossed in the heat. Had the man been Gignoux? If so, he\nwas in league with Carondelet’s police. I believed him fully capable of\nthis. And if he knew Nick’s whereabouts and St. Gré’s, they would both\nbe behind the iron gateway of the calabozo in the morning. Monsieur Vigo\nhad pointed out to me that day the gloomy, heavy-walled prison in\nthe rear of the Cabildo,--ay, and he had spoken of its instruments of\ntorture.\n\nWhat could the Vicomtesse want? Truly (I thought with remorse) she had\nbeen more industrious than I.\n\nI fell at length into a fevered sleep, and awoke, athirst, with the\nlight trickling through my lattices. Contrary to Madame Gravois’s\norders, I had opened the glass of my window. Glancing at my\nwatch,--which I had bought in Philadelphia,--I saw that the hands\npointed to half after seven. I had scarcely finished my toilet before\nthere was a knock at the door, and Madame Gravois entered with a\nsteaming cup of coffee in one hand and her bottle of medicine in the\nother.\n\n“I did not wake Monsieur,” she said, “for he was tired.”\n\nShe gave me another dose of the medicine, made me drink two cups of\ncoffee, and then I started out with all despatch for the House of the\nLions. As I turned into the Rue Chartres I saw ahead of me four horses,\nwith their bridles bunched and held by a negro lad, waiting in the\nstreet. Yes, they were in front of the house. There it was, with its\nsolid green gates between the lions, its yellow walls with the fringe\nof peeping magnolias and oranges, with its green-latticed gallery\nfrom which Monsieur Auguste had let himself down after stealing the\nminiature. I knocked at the wicket, the same gardienne answered the\ncall, smiled, led me through the cool, paved archway which held in its\nframe the green of the court beyond, and up the stairs with the quaint\nbalustrade which I had mounted five years before to meet Philippe de\nSt. Gré. As I reached the gallery Madame la Vicomtesse, gowned in brown\nlinen for riding, rose quickly from her chair and came forward to meet\nme.\n\n“You have news?” I asked, as I took her hand.\n\n“I have the kind of news I expected,” she answered, a smile tempering\nthe gravity of her face; “Auguste is, as usual, in need of money.”\n\n“Then you have found them,” I answered, my voice betraying my admiration\nfor the feat.\n\nMadame la Vicomtesse shrugged her shoulders slightly.\n\n“I did nothing,” she said. “From what you told me, I suspected that as\nsoon as Auguste reached Louisiana he would have a strong desire to go\naway again. This is undoubtedly what has happened. In any event, I knew\nthat he would want money, and that he would apply to a source which has\nhitherto never failed him.”\n\n“Mademoiselle Antoinette!” I said.\n\n“Precisely,” answered Madame la Vicomtesse. “When I reached home last\nnight I questioned Antoinette, and I discovered that by a singular\nchance a message from Auguste had already reached her.”\n\n“Where is he?” I demanded.\n\n“I do not know,” she replied. “But he will be behind the hedge of the\ngarden at Les Îles at eleven o’clock--unless he has lost before then his\nlove of money.”\n\n“Which is to say--”\n\n“He will be there unless he is dead. That is why I sent for you,\nMonsieur.” She glanced at me. “Sometimes it is convenient to have a\nman.”\n\nI was astounded. Then I smiled, the affair was so ridiculously simple.\n\n“And Monsieur de St. Gré?” I asked.\n\n“Has been gone for a week with Madame to visit the estimable Monsieur\nPoydras at Pointe Coupée.” Madame la Vicomtesse, who had better use\nfor her words than to waste them at such a time, left me, went to\nthe balcony, and began to give the gardienne in the court below swift\ndirections in French. Then she turned to me again.\n\n“Are you prepared to ride with Antoinette and me to Les Îles, Monsieur?”\n she asked.\n\n“I am,” I answered.\n\nIt must have been my readiness that made her smile. Then her eyes rested\non mine.\n\n“You look tired, Mr. Ritchie,” she said. “You did not obey me and go\nhome last night.”\n\n“How did you know that?” I asked, with a thrill at her interest.\n\n“Because Madame Gravois told my messenger that you were out.”\n\nI was silent.\n\n“You must take care of yourself,” she said briefly. “Come, there are\nsome things which I wish to say to you before Antoinette is ready.”\n\nShe led me toward the end of the gallery, where a bright screen of\nmorning-glories shaded us from the sun. But we had scarce reached the\nplace ere the sound of steps made us turn, and there was Mademoiselle\nAntoinette herself facing us. I went forward a few steps, hesitated,\nand bowed. She courtesied, my name faltering on her lips. Yes, it was\nAntoinette, not the light-hearted girl whom we had heard singing\n“Ma luron” in the garden, but a woman now with a strange beauty that\nastonished me. Hers was the dignity that comes from unselfish service,\nthe calm that is far from resignation, though the black veil caught\nup on her chapeau de paille gave her the air of a Sister of Mercy.\nAntoinette had inherited the energies as well as the features of the St.\nGré’s, yet there was a painful moment as she stood there, striving to\nput down the agitation the sight of me gave her. As for me, I was bereft\nof speech, not knowing what to say or how far to go. My last thought\nwas of the remarkable quality in this woman before me which had held her\ntrue to Mrs. Temple, and which sent her so courageously to her duty now.\n\nMadame la Vicomtesse, as I had hoped, relieved the situation. She knew\nhow to broach a dreaded subject.\n\n“Mr. Ritchie is going with us, Antoinette,” she said. “It is perhaps\nbest to explain everything to him before we start. I was about to tell\nyou, Mr. Ritchie,” she continued, turning to me, “that Auguste has given\nno hint in his note of Mr. Temple’s presence in Louisiana. And yet you\ntold me that they were to have come here together.”\n\n“Yes,” I answered, “and I have no reason to think they have separated.”\n\n“I was merely going to suggest,” said the Vicomtesse, firmly, “I was\nmerely going to suggest the possibility of our meeting Mr. Temple with\nAuguste.”\n\nIt was Antoinette who answered, with a force that revealed a new side of\nher character.\n\n“Mr. Temple will not be there,” she said, flashing a glance upon us. “Do\nyou think he would come to me--?”\n\nHélène laid her hand upon the girl’s arm.\n\n“My dear, I think nothing,” she said quietly; “but it is best for us\nto be prepared against any surprise. Remember that I do not know Mr.\nTemple, and that you have not seen him for five years.”\n\n“It is not like him, you know it is not like him,” exclaimed Antoinette,\nlooking at me.\n\n“I know it is not like him, Mademoiselle,” I replied.\n\nMadame la Vicomtesse, from behind the girl, gave me a significant look.\n\n“This occurred to me,” she went on in an undisturbed tone, “that Mr.\nTemple might come with Auguste to protest against the proceeding,--or\neven to defend himself against the imputation that he was to make use\nof this money in any way. I wish you to realize, Antoinette, before you\ndecide to go, that you may meet Mr. Temple. Would it not be better\nto let Mr. Ritchie go alone? I am sure that we could find no better\nemissary.”\n\n“Auguste is here,” said Antoinette. “I must see him.” Her voice caught.\n“I may never see him again. He may be ill, he may be starving--and I\nknow that he is in trouble. Whether” (her voice caught) “whether Mr.\nTemple is with him or not, I mean to go.”\n\n“Then it would be well to start,” said the Vicomtesse.\n\nDeftly dropping her veil, she picked up a riding whip that lay on the\nrailing and descended the stairs to the courtyard. Antoinette and I\nfollowed. As we came through the archway I saw André, Monsieur de St.\nGré’s mulatto, holding open the wicket for us to pass. He helped the\nladies to mount the ponies, lengthened my own stirrups for me, swung\ninto the saddle himself, and then the four of us were picking our way\ndown the Rue Chartres at an easy amble. Turning to the right beyond the\ncool garden of the Ursulines, past the yellow barracks, we came to the\nriver front beside the fortifications. A score of negroes were\nsweating there in the sun, swinging into position the long logs for the\npalisades, nearly completed. They were like those of Kaskaskia and our\nown frontier forts in Kentucky, with a forty-foot ditch in front of\nthem. Seated on a horse talking to the overseer was a fat little man in\nwhite linen who pulled off his hat and bowed profoundly to the ladies.\nHis face gave me a start, and then I remembered that I had seen him only\nthe day before, resplendent, coming out of church. He was the Baron de\nCarondelet.\n\nThere was a sentry standing under a crape-myrtle where the Royal Road\nran through the gateway. Behind him was a diminutive five-sided brick\nfort with a dozen little cannon on top of it. The sentry came forward,\nbrought his musket to a salute, and halted before my horse.\n\n“You will have to show your passport,” murmured Madame la Vicomtesse.\n\nI drew the document from my pocket. It was signed by De Lemos, and duly\ncountersigned by the officer of the port. The man bowed, and I passed\non.\n\nIt was a strange, silent ride through the stinging heat to Les Îles,\nthe brown dust hanging behind us like a cloud, to settle slowly on the\nwayside shrubbery. Across the levee bank the river was low, listless,\ngiving off hot breath like a monster in distress. The forest pools were\ncracked and dry, the Spanish moss was a haggard gray, and under the sun\nwas the haze which covered the land like a saffron mantle. At times a\nlistlessness came over me such as I had never known, to make me forget\nthe presence of the women at my side, the very errand on which we rode.\nFrom time to time I was roused into admiration of the horsemanship of\nMadame la Vicomtesse, for the restive Texas pony which she rode was\nstung to madness by the flies. As for Antoinette, she glanced neither\nright nor left through her veil, but rode unmindful of the way, heedless\nof heat and discomfort, erect, motionless save for the easy gait of her\nhorse. At length we turned into the avenue through the forest, lined\nby wild orange trees, came in sight of the low, belvedered plantation\nhouse, and drew rein at the foot of the steps. Antoinette was the first\nto dismount, and passed in silence through the group of surprised house\nservants gathering at the door. I assisted the Vicomtesse, who paused\nto bid the negroes disperse, and we lingered for a moment on the gallery\ntogether.\n\n“Poor Antoinette!” she said, “I wish we might have saved her this.” She\nlooked up at me. “How she defended him!” she exclaimed.\n\n“She loves him,” I answered.\n\nMadame la Vicomtesse sighed.\n\n“I suppose there is no help for it,” she said. “But it is very difficult\nnot to be angry with Mr. Temple. The girl cared for his mother, gave\nher a home, clung to her when he and the world would have cast her off,\nsacrificed her happiness for them both. If I see him, I believe I shall\nshake him. And if he doesn’t fall down on his knees to her, I shall ask\nthe Baron to hang him. We must bring him to his senses, Mr. Ritchie. He\nmust not leave Louisiana until he sees her. Then he will marry her.” She\npaused, scrutinized me in her quick way, and added: “You see that I take\nyour estimation of his character. You ought to be flattered.”\n\n“I am flattered by any confidence you repose in me, Madame la\nVicomtesse.”\n\nShe laughed. I was not flattered then, but cursed myself for the quaint\nawkwardness in my speech that amused her. And she was astonishingly\nquick to perceive my moods.\n\n“There, don’t be angry. You will never be a courtier, my honest friend,\nand you may thank God for it. How sweet the shrubs are! Your chief\nbusiness in life seems to be getting people out of trouble, and I am\ngoing to help you with this case.”\n\nIt was my turn to laugh.\n\n“You are going to help!” I exclaimed. “My services have been heavy, so\nfar.”\n\n“You should not walk around at night,” she replied irrelevantly.\n\nSuddenly I remembered Gignoux, but even as I was about to tell her of\nthe incident Antoinette appeared in the doorway. She was very pale, but\nher lips were set with excitement and her eyes shone strangely. She was\nstill in her riding gown, in her hand she carried a leather bag, and\nbehind her stood André with a bundle.\n\n“Quick!” she said; “we are wasting time, and he may be gone.”\n\nChecking an exclamation which could hardly have been complimentary to\nAuguste, the Vicomtesse crossed quickly to her and put her arm about\nher.\n\n“We will follow you, mignonne,” she said in French.\n\n“Must you come?” said Antoinette, appealingly. “He may not appear if he\nsees any one.”\n\n“We shall have to risk that,” said the Vicomtesse, dryly, with a glance\nat me. “You shall not go alone, but we will wait a few moments at the\nhedge.”\n\nWe took the well-remembered way through the golden-green light under the\ntrees, Antoinette leading, and the sight of the garden brought back to\nme poignantly the scene in the moonlight with Mrs. Temple. There was no\nsound save the languid morning notes of the birds and the humming of the\nbees among the flowers as Antoinette went tremblingly down the path\nand paused, listening, under the branches of that oak where I had first\nbeheld her. Then, with a little cry, we saw her run forward--into the\narms of Auguste de St. Gré. It was a pitiful thing to look upon.\n\nAntoinette had led her brother to the seat under the oak. How long\nwe waited I know not, but at length we heard their voices raised, and\nwithout more ado Madame la Vicomtesse, beckoning me, passed quickly\nthrough the gap in the hedge and went towards them. I followed with\nAndré. Auguste rose with an oath, and then stood facing his cousin\nlike a man struck dumb, his hands dropped. He was a sorry sight indeed,\nunshaven, unkempt, dark circles under his eyes, clothes torn.\n\n“Hélène! You here--in America!” he cried in French, staring at her.\n\n“Yes, Auguste,” she replied quite simply, “I am here.” He would have\ncome towards her, but there was a note in her voice which arrested him.\n\n“And Monsieur le Vicomte--Henri?” he said.\n\nI found myself listening tensely for the answer.\n\n“Henri is in Austria, fighting for his King, I hope,” said Madame la\nVicomtesse.\n\n“So Madame la Vicomtesse is a refugee,” he said with a bow and a smile\nthat made me very angry.\n\n“And Monsieur de St. Gré!” I asked.\n\nAt the sound of my voice he started and gave back, for he had not\nperceived me. He recovered his balance, such as it was, instantly.\n\n“Monsieur seems to take an extraordinary interest in my affairs,” he\nsaid jauntily.\n\n“Only when they are to the detriment of other persons who are my\nfriends,” I said.\n\n“Monsieur has intruded in a family matter,” said Auguste, grandly, still\nin French.\n\n“By invitation of those most concerned, Monsieur,” I answered, for I\ncould have throttled him.\n\nAuguste had developed. He had learned well that effrontery is often\nthe best weapon of an adventurer. He turned from me disdainfully,\npetulantly, and addressed the Vicomtesse once more.\n\n“I wish to be alone with Antoinette,” he said.\n\n“No doubt,” said the Vicomtesse.\n\n“I demand it,” said Auguste.\n\n“The demand is not granted,” said the Vicomtesse; “that is why we have\ncome. Your sister has already made enough sacrifices for you. I know\nyou, Monsieur Auguste de St. Gré,” she continued with quiet contempt.\n“It is not for love of Antoinette that you have sought this meeting.\nIt is because,” she said, riding down a torrent of words which began to\nescape from him, “it is because you are in a predicament, as usual, and\nyou need money.”\n\n“Hélène!”\n\nIt was Antoinette who spoke. She had risen, and was standing behind\nAuguste. She still held the leather bag in her hand.\n\n“Perhaps the sum is not enough,” she said; “he has to get to France.\nPerhaps we could borrow more until my father comes home.” She looked\nquestioningly at us.\n\nMadame la Vicomtesse was truly a woman of decision. Without more ado she\ntook the bag from Antoinette’s unresisting hands and put it into mine. I\nwas no less astonished than the rest of them.\n\n“Mr. Ritchie will keep this until the negotiations are finished,” said\nthe Vicomtesse.\n\n“Negotiations!” cried Auguste, beside himself. “This is insolence,\nMadame.”\n\n“Be careful, sir,” I said.\n\n“Auguste!” cried Antoinette, putting her hand on his arm.\n\n“Why did you tell them?” he demanded, turning on her.\n\n“Because I trust them, Auguste,” Antoinette answered. She spoke without\nanger, as one whose sorrow has put her beyond it. Her speech had\na dignity and force which might have awed a worthier man. His\ndisappointment and chagrin brought him beyond bounds.\n\n“You trust them!” he cried, “you trust them when they tell you to give\nyour brother, who is starving and in peril of his life, eight hundred\nlivres? Eight hundred livres, pardieu, and your brother!”\n\n“It is all I have, Auguste,” said his sister, sadly.\n\n“Ha!” he said dramatically, “I see, they seek my destruction. This\nman”--pointing at me--“is a Federalist, and Madame la Vicomtesse”--he\nbowed ironically--“is a Royalist.”\n\n“Pish!” said the Vicomtesse, impatiently, “it would be an easy matter to\nhave you sent to the Morro--a word to Monsieur de Carondelet, Auguste.\nDo you believe for a moment that, in your father’s absence, I would have\nallowed Antoinette to come here alone? And it was a happy circumstance\nthat I could call on such a man as Mr. Ritchie to come with us.”\n\n“It seems to me that Mr. Ritchie and his friends have already brought\nsufficient misfortune on the family.”\n\nIt was a villanous speech. Antoinette turned away, her shoulders\nquivering, and I took a step towards him; but Madame la Vicomtesse made\na swift gesture, and I stopped, I know not why. She gave an exclamation\nso sharp that he flinched physically, as though he had been struck. But\nit was characteristic of her that when she began to speak, her words cut\nrather than lashed.\n\n“Auguste de St. Gré,” she said, “I know you. The Tribunal is merciful\ncompared to you. There is no one on earth whom you would not torture for\nyour selfish ends, no one whom you would not sell without compunction\nfor your pleasure. There are things that a woman should not mention, and\nyet I would tell them without shame to your face were it not for your\nsister. If it were not for her, I would not have you in my presence.\nShall I speak of your career in France? There is Valenciennes, for\nexample--”\n\nShe stopped abruptly. The man was gray, but not on his account did the\nVicomtesse stay her speech. She forgot him as though he did not exist,\nand by one of those swift transitions which thrilled me had gone to the\nsobbing Antoinette and taken her in her arms, murmuring endearments\nof which our language is not capable. I, too, forgot Auguste. But no\nrebuke, however stinging, could make him forget himself, and before we\nrealized it he was talking again. He had changed his tactics.\n\n“This is my home,” he said, “where I might expect shelter and comfort.\nYou make me an outcast.”\n\nAntoinette disengaged herself from Hélène with a cry, but he turned away\nfrom her and shrugged.\n\n“A stranger would have fared better. Perhaps you will have more\nconsideration for a stranger. There is a French ship at the Terre aux\nBœufs in the English Turn, which sails to-night. I appeal to you, Mr.\nRitchie,”--he was still talking in French--“I appeal to you, who are\na man of affairs,”--and he swept me a bow,--“if a captain would risk\ntaking a fugitive to France for eight hundred livres? Pardieu, I could\nget no farther than the Balize for that. Monsieur,” he added meaningly,\n“you have an interest in this. There are two of us to go.”\n\nThe amazing effrontery of this move made me gasp. Yet it was neither the\nVicomtesse nor myself who answered him. We turned by common impulse\nto Antoinette, and she was changed. Her breath came quickly, her eyes\nflashed, her anger made her magnificent.\n\n“It is not true,” she cried, “you know it is not true.”\n\nHe lifted his shoulders and smiled.\n\n“You are my brother, and I am ashamed to acknowledge you. I was willing\nto give my last sou, to sell my belongings, to take from the poor to\nhelp you--until you defamed a good man. You cannot make me believe,” she\ncried, unheeding the color that surged into her cheeks, “you cannot make\nme believe that he would use this money. You cannot make me believe it.”\n\n“Let us do him the credit of thinking that he means to repay it,” said\nAuguste.\n\nAntoinette’s eyes filled with tears,--tears of pride, of humiliation,\nay, and of an anger of which I had not thought her capable. She was\nindeed a superb creature then, a personage I had not imagined. Gathering\nup her gown, she passed Auguste and turned on him swiftly.\n\n“If you were to bring that to him,” she said, pointing to the bag in\nmy hand, “he would not so much as touch it. To-morrow I shall go to the\nUrsulines, and I thank God I shall never see you again. I thank God I\nshall no longer be your sister. Give Monsieur the bundle,” she said to\nthe frightened André, who still stood by the hedge; “he may need food\nand clothes for his journey.”\n\nShe left us. We stood watching her until her gown had disappeared\namongst the foliage. André came forward and held out the bundle to\nAuguste, who took it mechanically. Then Madame La Vicomtesse motioned\nto André to leave, and gave me a glance, and it was part of the deep\nunderstanding of her I had that I took its meaning. I had my forebodings\nat what this last conversation with Auguste might bring forth, and I\nwished heartily that we were rid of him.\n\n“Monsieur de St. Gré,” I said, “I understood you to say that a ship is\nlying at the English Turn some five leagues below us, on which you are\nto take passage at once.”\n\nHe turned and glared at me, some devilish retort on his lips which he\nheld back. Suddenly he became suave.\n\n“I shall want two thousand livres Monsieur; it was the sum I asked for.”\n\n“It is not a question of what you asked for,” I answered.\n\n“Since when did Monsieur assume this intimate position in my family?” he\nsaid, glancing at the Vicomtesse.\n\n“Monsieur de St. Gré,” I replied with difficulty, “you will confine\nyourself to the matter in hand. You are in no situation to demand terms;\nyou must take or leave what is offered you. Last night the man called\nGignoux, who was of your party, was at the Governor’s house.”\n\nAt this he started perceptibly.\n\n“Ha, I thought he was a traitor,” he cried. Strangely enough, he did not\ndoubt my word in this.\n\n“I am surprised that your father’s house has not been searched this\nmorning,” I continued, astonished at my own moderation. “The sentiments\nof the Baron de Carondelet are no doubt known to you, and you are aware\nthat your family or your friends cannot save you if you are arrested.\nYou may have this money on two conditions. The first is that you leave\nthe province immediately. The second, that you reveal the whereabouts of\nMr. Nicholas Temple.”\n\n“Monsieur is very kind,” he replied, and added the taunt, “and well\nversed in the conduct of affairs of money.”\n\n“Does Monsieur de St. Gré accept?” I asked.\n\nHe threw out his hands with a gesture of resignation.\n\n“Who am I to accept?” he said, “a fugitive, an outcast. And I should\nlike to remind Monsieur that time passes.”\n\n“It is a sensible observation,” said I, meaning that it was the first.\nHis sudden docility made me suspicious. “What preparations have you made\nto go?”\n\n“They are not elaborate, Monsieur, but they are complete. When I leave\nyou I step into a pirogue which is tied to the river bank.”\n\n“Ah,” I replied. “And Mr. Temple?”\n\nMadame la Vicomtesse smiled, for Auguste was fairly caught. He had not\nthe astuteness to be a rogue; oddly, he had the sense to know that he\ncould fool us no longer.\n\n“Temple is at Lamarque’s,” he answered sullenly.\n\nI glanced questioningly at the Vicomtesse.\n\n“Lamarque is an old pensioner of Monsieur de St. Gré’s,” said she; “he\nhas a house and an arpent of land not far below here.”\n\n“Exactly,” said Auguste, “and if Mr. Ritchie believes that he will save\nmoney by keeping Mr. Temple in Louisiana instead of giving him this\nopportunity to escape, it is no concern of mine.”\n\nI reflected a moment on this, for it was another sensible remark.\n\n“It is indeed no concern of yours,” said Madame la Vicomtesse.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n“And now,” he said, “I take it that there are no further conscientious\nscruples against my receiving this paltry sum.”\n\n“I will go with you to your pirogue,” I answered, “when you embark you\nshall have it.”\n\n“I, too, will go,” said Madame la Vicomtesse.\n\n“You overwhelm me with civility, Madame,” said the Sieur de St. Gré,\nbowing low.\n\n“Lead the way, Monsieur,” I said.\n\nHe took his bundle, and started off down the garden path with a grand\nair. I looked at the Vicomtesse inquiringly, and there was laughter in\nher eyes.\n\n“I must show you the way to Lamarque’s.” And then she whispered, “You\nhave done well, Mr. Ritchie.”\n\nI did not return her look, but waited until she took the path ahead\nof me. In silence we followed Auguste through the depths of the woods,\nturning here and there to avoid a fallen tree or a sink-hole where the\nwater still remained. At length we came out in the glare of the sun and\ncrossed the dusty road to the levee bank. Some forty yards below us was\nthe canoe, and we walked to it, still in silence. Auguste flung in his\nbundle, and turned to us.\n\n“Perhaps Monsieur is satisfied,” he said.\n\nI handed him the bag, and he took it with an elaborate air of\nthankfulness. Nay, the rascal opened it as if to assure himself that he\nwas not tricked at the last. At the sight of the gold and silver which\nAntoinette had hastily collected, he turned to Madame la Vicomtesse.\n\n“Should I have the good fortune to meet Monsieur le Vicomte in France,\nI shall assure him that Madame is in good hands” (he swept an exultant\nlook at me) “and enjoying herself.”\n\nI could have flung him into the river, money-bag and all. But Madame\nla Vicomtesse made him a courtesy there on the levee bank, and said\nsweetly:--\n\n“That is very good of you, Auguste.”\n\n“As for you, Monsieur,” he said, and now his voice shook with\nuncontrolled rage, “I am in no condition to repay your kindnesses. But I\nhave no doubt that you will not object to keeping the miniature a while\nlonger.”\n\nI was speechless with anger and shame, and though I felt the eyes of\nthe Vicomtesse upon me, I dared not look at her. I heard Auguste but\nindistinctly as he continued:--\n\n“Should you need the frame, Monsieur, you will doubtless find it still\nwith Monsieur Isadore, the Jew, in the Rue Toulouse.” With that he\nleaped into his boat, seized the paddle, and laughed as he headed into\nthe current. How long I stood watching him as he drifted lazily in the\nsun I know not, but at length the voice of Madame la Vicomtesse aroused\nme.\n\n“He is a pleasant person,” she said.\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. AT LAMARQUE’S\n\nUntil then it seemed as if the sun had gotten into my brain and set it\non fire. Her words had the strange effect of clearing my head, though I\nwas still in as sad a predicament as ever I found myself. There was the\nthing in my pocket, still wrapped in Polly Ann’s handkerchief. I\nglanced at the Vicomtesse shyly, and turned away again. Her face was all\nrepressed laughter, the expression I knew so well.\n\n“I think we should feel better in the shade, Mr. Ritchie,” she said\nin English, and, leaping lightly down from the bank, crossed the road\nagain. I followed her, perforce.\n\n“I will show you the way to Lamarque’s,” she said.\n\n“Madame la Vicomtesse!” I cried.\n\nHad she no curiosity? Was she going to let pass what Auguste had hinted?\nLifting up her skirts, she swung round and faced me. In her eyes was\na calmness more baffling than the light I had seen there but a moment\nsince. How to begin I knew not, and yet I was launched.\n\n“Madame la Vicomtesse, there was once a certain miniature painted of\nyou.”\n\n“By Boze, Monsieur,” she answered, readily enough. The embarrassment was\nall on my side. “We spoke of it last evening. I remember well when\nit was taken. It was the costume I wore at Chantilly, and Monsieur le\nPrince complimented me, and the next day the painter himself came to our\nhotel in the Rue de Bretagne and asked the honor of painting me.” She\nsighed. “Ah, those were happy days! Her Majesty was very angry with me.”\n\n“And why?” I asked, forgetful of my predicament.\n\n“For sending it to Louisiana, to Antoinette.”\n\n“And why did you send it?”\n\n“A whim,” said the Vicomtesse. “I had always written twice a year either\nto Monsieur de St. Gré or Antoinette, and although I had never seen\nthem, I loved them. Perhaps it was because they had the patience to read\nmy letters and the manners to say they liked them.”\n\n“Surely not, Madame,” I said. “Monsieur de St. Gré spoke often to me of\nthe wonderful pictures you drew of the personages at court.”\n\nMadame la Vicomtesse had an answer on the tip of her tongue. I know now\nthat she spared me.\n\n“And what of this miniature, Monsieur?” she asked. “What became of it\nafter you restored it to its rightful owner?”\n\nI flushed furiously and fumbled in my pocket.\n\n“I obtained it again, Madame,” I said.\n\n“You obtained it!” she cried, I am not sure to this day whether in\nconsternation or jest. In passing, it was not just what I wanted to say.\n\n“I meant to give it you last night,” I said.\n\n“And why did you not?” she demanded severely.\n\nI felt her eyes on me, and it seemed to me as if she were looking into\nmy very soul. Even had it been otherwise, I could not have told her how\nI had lived with this picture night and day, how I had dreamed of it,\nhow it had been my inspiration and counsel. I drew it from my pocket,\nwrapped as it was in the handkerchief, and uncovered it with a reverence\nwhich she must have marked, for she turned away to pick a yellow flower\nby the roadside. I thank Heaven that she did not laugh. Indeed, she\nseemed to be far from laughter.\n\n“You have taken good care of it, Monsieur,” she said. “I thank you.”\n\n“It was not mine, Madame,” I answered.\n\n“And if it had been?” she asked.\n\nIt was a strange prompting.\n\n“If it had been, I could have taken no better care of it,” I answered,\nand I held it towards her.\n\nShe took it simply.\n\n“And the handkerchief?” she said.\n\n“The handkerchief was Polly Ann’s,” I answered.\n\nShe stopped to pick a second flower that had grown by the first.\n\n“Who is Polly Ann?” she said.\n\n“When I was eleven years of age and ran away from Temple Bow after\nmy father died, Polly Ann found me in the hills. When she married Tom\nMcChesney they took me across the mountains into Kentucky with them.\nPolly Ann has been more than a mother to me.”\n\n“Oh!” said Madame la Vicomtesse. Then she looked at me with a stranger\nexpression than I had yet seen in her face. She thrust the miniature in\nher gown, turned, and walked in silence awhile. Then she said:--\n\n“So Auguste sold it again?”\n\n“Yes,” I said.\n\n“He seems to have found a ready market only in you,” said the\nVicomtesse, without turning her head. “Here we are at Lamarque’s.”\n\nWhat I saw was a low, weather-beaten cabin on the edge of a clearing,\nand behind it stretched away in prim rows the vegetables which the old\nFrenchman had planted. There was a little flower garden, too, and an\norchard. A path of beaten earth led to the door, which was open. There\nwe paused. Seated at a rude table was Lamarque himself, his hoary head\nbent over the cards he held in his hand. Opposite him was Mr. Nicholas\nTemple, in the act of playing the ace of spades. I think that it was\nthe laughter of Madame la Vicomtesse that first disturbed them, and even\nthen she had time to turn to me.\n\n“I like your cousin,” she whispered.\n\n“Is that you, St. Gré?” said Nick. “I wish to the devil you would learn\nnot to sneak. You frighten me. Where the deuce did you go to?”\n\nBut Lamarque had seen the lady, stared at her wildly for a moment, and\nrose, dropping his cards on the floor. He bowed humbly, not without\ntrepidation.\n\n“Madame la Vicomtesse!” he said.\n\nBy this time Nick had risen, and he, too, was staring at her. How he\nmanaged to appear so well dressed was a puzzle to me.\n\n“Madame,” he said, bowing, “I beg your pardon. I thought you were\nthat--I beg your pardon.”\n\n“I understand your feelings, sir,” answered the Vicomtesse as she\ncourtesied.\n\n“Egad,” said Nick, and looked at her again. “Egad, I’ll be hanged if\nit’s not--”\n\nIt was the first time I had seen the Vicomtesse in confusion. And indeed\nif it were confusion she recovered instantly.\n\n“You will probably be hanged, sir, if you do not mend your company,” she\nsaid. “Do you not think so, Mr. Ritchie?”\n\n“Davy!” he cried. And catching sight of me in the doorway, over her\nshoulder, “Has he followed me here too?” Running past the Vicomtesse,\nhe seized me in his impulsive way and searched my face. “So you have\nfollowed me here, old faithful! Madame,” he added, turning to the\nVicomtesse, “there is some excuse for my getting into trouble.”\n\n“What excuse, Monsieur?” she asked. She was smiling, yet looking at us\nwith shining eyes.\n\n“The pleasure of having Mr. Ritchie get me out,” he answered. “He has\nnever failed me.”\n\n“You are far from being out of this,” I said. “If the Baron de\nCarondelet does not hang you or put you in the Morro, you will not have\nme to thank. It will be Madame la Vicomtesse d’Ivry-le-Tour.”\n\n“Madame la Vicomtesse!” exclaimed Nick, puzzled.\n\n“May I present to you, Madame, Mr. Nicholas Temple?” I asked.\n\nNick bowed, and she courtesied again.\n\n“So Monsieur le Baron is really after us,” said Nick. He opened his\neyes, slapped his knee, and laughed. “That may account for the Citizen\nCaptain de St. Gré’s absence,” he said. “By the way, Davy, you haven’t\nhappened by any chance to meet him?”\n\nThe Vicomtesse and I exchanged a look of understanding. Relief was plain\non her face. It was she who answered.\n\n“We have met him--by chance, Monsieur. He has just left for Terre aux\nBœufs.”\n\n“Terre aux Bœufs! What the dev--I beg your pardon, Madame la Vicomtesse,\nbut you give me something of a surprise. Is there another conspiracy at\nTerre aux Bœufs, or--does somebody live there who has never before lent\nAuguste money?”\n\nMadame la Vicomtesse laughed. Then she grew serious again.\n\n“You did not know where he had gone?” she said.\n\n“I did not even know he had gone,” said Nick. “Citizen Lamarque and I\nwere having a little game of piquet--for vegetables. Eh, citizen?”\n\nMadame la Vicomtesse laughed again, and once more the shade of sadness\ncame into her eyes.\n\n“They are the same the world over,” she said,--not to me, nor yet to any\none there. And I knew that she was thinking of her own kind in France,\nwho faced the guillotine without sense of danger. She turned to Nick.\n“You may be interested to know, Mr. Temple,” she added, “that Auguste is\non his way to the English Turn to take ship for France.”\n\nNick regarded her for a moment, and then his face lighted up with that\nsmile which won every one he met, which inevitably made them smile back\nat him.\n\n“The news is certainly unexpected, Madame,” he said. “But then, after\none has travelled much with Auguste it is difficult to take a great deal\nof interest in him. Am I to be sent to France, too?” he asked.\n\n“Not if it can be helped,” replied the Vicomtesse, seriously. “Mr.\nRitchie will tell you, however, that you are in no small danger.\nDoubtless you know it. Monsieur le Baron de Carondelet considers that\nthe intrigues of the French Revolutionists in Louisiana have already\nrobbed him of several years of his life. He is not disposed to be\nlenient towards persons connected with that cause.”\n\n“What have you been doing since you arrived here on this ridiculous\nmission?” I demanded impatiently.\n\n“My cousin is a narrow man, Madame la Vicomtesse,” said Nick. “We enjoy\nourselves in different ways. I thought there might be some excitement in\nthis matter, and I was sadly mistaken.”\n\n“It is not over yet,” said the Vicomtesse.\n\n“And Davy,” continued Nick, bowing to me, “gets his pleasures and\nexcitement by extracting me from my various entanglements. Well, there\nis not much to tell. St. Gré and I were joined above Natchez by that\nlittle pig, Citizen Gignoux, and we shot past De Lemos in the night.\nSince then we have been permitted to sleep--no more--at various\nplantations. We have been waked up at barbarous hours in the morning and\nhanded on, as it were. They were all fond of us, but likewise they were\nall afraid of the Baron. What day is to-day? Monday? Then it was on\nSaturday that we lost Gignoux.”\n\n“I have reason to think that he has already sold out to the Baron,” I\nput in.\n\n“Eh?”\n\n“I saw him in communication with the police at the Governor’s hotel last\nnight,” I answered.\n\nNick was silent for a moment.\n\n“Well,” he said, “that may make some excitement.” Then he laughed.\n“I wonder why Auguste didn’t think of doing that,” he said. “And now,\nwhat?”\n\n“How did you get to this house?” I said.\n\n“We came down on Saturday night, after we had lost Gignoux above the\ncity.”\n\n“Do you know where you are?” I asked.\n\n“Not I,” said Nick. “I have been playing piquet with Lamarque most of\nthe time since I arrived. He is one of the pleasantest men I have met in\nLouisiana, although a little taciturn, as you perceive, and more than\na little deaf. I think he does not like Auguste. He seems to have known\nhim in his youth.”\n\nMadame la Vicomtesse looked at him with interest.\n\n“You are at Les Îles, Nick,” I said; “you are on Monsieur de St. Gré’s\nplantation, and within a quarter of a mile of his house.”\n\nHis face became grave all at once. He seized me by both shoulders, and\nlooked into my face.\n\n“You say that we are at Les Îles?” he repeated slowly.\n\nI nodded, seeing the deception which Auguste had evidently practised in\norder to get him here. Then Nick dropped his arms, went to the door, and\nstood for a long time with his back turned to us, looking out over the\nfields. When finally he spoke it was in the tone he used in anger.\n\n“If I had him now, I think I would kill him,” he said.\n\nAuguste had deluded him in other things, had run away and deserted him\nin a strange land. But this matter of bringing him to Les Îles was past\npardon. It was another face he turned to the Vicomtesse, a stronger\nface, a face ennobled by a just anger.\n\n“Madame la Vicomtesse,” he said, “I have a vague notion that you\nare related to Monsieur de St. Gré. I give you my word of honor as a\ngentleman that I had no thought of trespassing upon him in any way.”\n\n“Mr. Temple, we were so sure of that--Mr. Ritchie and I--that we should\nnot have sought for you here otherwise,” she replied quickly. Then she\nglanced at me as though seeking my approval for her next move. It was\ncharacteristic of her that she did not now shirk a task imposed by\nher sense of duty. “We have little time, Mr. Temple, and much to say.\nPerhaps you will excuse us, Lamarque,” she added graciously, in French.\n\n“Madame la Vicomtesse!” said the old man. And, with the tact of his\nrace, he bowed and retired. The Vicomtesse seated herself on one of the\nrude chairs, and looked at Nick curiously. There was no such thing as\nembarrassment in her manner, no trace of misgiving that she would not\nmove properly in the affair. Knowing Nick as I did, the difficulty of\nthe task appalled me, for no man was likelier than he to fly off at a\nmisplaced word.\n\nHer beginning was so bold that I held my breath, knowing full well as I\ndid that she had chosen the very note.\n\n“Sit down, Mr. Temple,” she said. “I wish to speak to you about your\nmother.”\n\nHe stopped like a man who had been struck, straightened, and stared at\nher as though he had not taken her meaning. Then he swung on me.\n\n“Your mother is in New Orleans,” I said. “I would have told you in\nLouisville had you given me the chance.”\n\n“It is an interesting piece of news, David,” he answered, “which you\nmight have spared me. Mrs. Temple did not think herself necessary to my\nwelfare when I was young, and now I have learned to live without her.”\n\n“Is there no such thing as expiation, Monsieur?” said the Vicomtesse.\n\n“Madame,” he said, “she made me what I am, and when I might have\nredeemed myself she came between me and happiness.”\n\n“Monsieur,” said the Vicomtesse, “have you ever considered her\nsufferings?”\n\nHe looked at the Vicomtesse with a new interest. She was not so far\nbeyond his experience as mine.\n\n“Her sufferings?” he repeated, and smiled.\n\n“Madame la Vicomtesse should know them,” I interrupted; and without\nheeding her glance of protest I continued, “It is she who has cared for\nMrs. Temple.”\n\n“You, Madame!” he exclaimed.\n\n“Do not deny your own share in it, Mr. Ritchie,” she answered. “As for\nme, Monsieur,” she went on, turning to Nick, “I have done nothing\nthat was not selfish. I have been in the world, I have lived my life,\nmisfortunes have come upon me too. My visits to your mother have been to\nme a comfort, a pleasure,--for she is a rare person.”\n\n“I have never found her so, Madame,” he said briefly.\n\n“I am sure it is your misfortune rather than your fault, Mr. Temple. It\nis because you do not know her now.”\n\nAgain he looked at me, puzzled, uneasy, like a man who would run if he\ncould. But by a kind of fascination his eyes went back to this woman\nwho dared a subject sore to the touch--who pressed it gently, but\nwith determination, never doubting her powers, yet with a kindness and\nsympathy of tone which few women of the world possess. The Vicomtesse\nbegan to speak again, evenly, gently.\n\n“Mr. Temple,” said she, “I am merely going to tell you some things which\nI am sure you do not know, and when I have finished I shall not appeal\nto you. It would be useless for me to try to influence you, and from\nwhat Mr. Ritchie and others have told me of your character I am sure\nthat no influence will be necessary. And,” she added, with a smile, “it\nwould be much more comfortable for us both if you sat down.”\n\nHe obeyed her without a word. No wonder Madame la Vicomtesse had had an\ninfluence at court.\n\n“There!” she said. “If any reference I am about to make gives you pain,\nI am sorry.” She paused briefly. “After Mr. Ritchie took your mother\nfrom here to New Orleans, some five years ago, she rented a little house\nin the Rue Bourbon with a screen of yellow and red tiles at the edge\nof the roof. It is on the south side, next to the corner of the Rue St.\nPhilippe. There she lives absolutely alone, except for a servant. Mr.\nClark, who has charge of her affairs, was the only person she allowed to\nvisit her. For her pride, however misplaced, and for her spirit we must\nall admire her. The friend who discovered where she was, who went to her\nand implored Mrs. Temple to let her stay, she refused.”\n\n“The friend?” he repeated in a low tone. I scarcely dared to glance at\nthe Vicomtesse.\n\n“Yes, it was Antoinette,” she answered. He did not reply, but his eyes\nfell. “Antoinette went to her, would have comforted her, would have\ncared for her, but your mother sent her away. For five years she has\nlived there, Mr. Temple, alone with her past, alone with her sorrow and\nremorse. You must draw the picture for yourself. If the world has a more\nterrible punishment, I have not heard of it. And when, some months ago,\nI came, and Antoinette sent me to her--”\n\n“Sent you to her!” he said, raising his head quickly.\n\n“Under another name than my own,” Hélène continued, apparently taking\nno notice of his interruption. She leaned toward him and her voice\nfaltered. “I found your mother dying.”\n\nHe said nothing, but got to his feet and walked slowly to the door,\nwhere he stood looking out again. I felt for him, I would have gone to\nhim then had it not been for the sense in me that Hélène did not wish\nit. As for Hélène, she sat waiting for him to turn back to her, and at\nlength he did.\n\n“Yes?” he said.\n\n“It is her heart, Mr. Temple, that we fear the most. Last night I\nthought the end had come. It cannot be very far away now. Sorrow and\nremorse have killed her, Monsieur. The one thing that she has prayed for\nthrough the long nights is that she might see you once again and\nobtain your forgiveness. God Himself does not withhold forgiveness, Mr.\nTemple,” said the Vicomtesse, gently. “Shall any of us presume to?”\n\nA spasm of pain crossed his face, and then his expression hardened.\n\n“I might have been a useful man,” he said; “she ruined my life--”\n\n“And you will allow her to ruin the rest of it?” asked the Vicomtesse.\n\nHe stared at her.\n\n“If you do not go to her and forgive her, you will remember it until you\ndie,” she said.\n\nHe sank down on the chair opposite to her, his head bowed into his\nhands, his elbows on the table among the cards. At length I went and\nlaid my hands upon his shoulder, and at my touch he started. Then he did\na singular thing, an impulsive thing, characteristic of the old Nick I\nhad known. He reached across the table and seized the hand of Madame la\nVicomtesse. She did not resist, and her smile I shall always remember.\nIt was the smile of a woman who has suffered, and understands.\n\n“I will go to her, Madame!” he said, springing to his feet. “I will go\nto her. I--I was wrong.”\n\nShe rose, too, he still clinging to her hand, she still unresisting. His\neye fell upon me.\n\n“Where is my hat, Davy?” he asked.\n\nThe Vicomtesse withdrew her hand and looked at me.\n\n“Alas, it is not quite so simple as that, Mr. Temple,” she said;\n“Monsieur de Carondelet has first to be reckoned with.”\n\n“She is dying, you say? then I will go to her. After that Monsieur de\nCarondelet may throw me into prison, may hang me, may do anything he\nchooses. But I will go to her.”\n\nI glanced anxiously at the Vicomtesse, well knowing how wilful he was\nwhen aroused. Admiration was in her eyes, seeing that he was heedless of\nhis own danger.\n\n“You would not get through the gates of the city. Monsieur le Baron\nrequires passports now,” she said.\n\nAt that he began to pace the little room, his hands clenched.\n\n“I could use your passport, Davy,” he cried. “Let me have it.”\n\n“Pardon me, Mr. Temple, I do not think you could,” said the Vicomtesse.\nI flushed. I suppose the remark was not to be resisted.\n\n“Then I will go to-night,” he said, with determination. “It will be no\ntrouble to steal into the city. You say the house has yellow and red\ntiles, and is near the Rue St. Philippe?”\n\nHélène laid her fingers on his arm.\n\n“Listen, Monsieur, there is a better way,” she said. “Monsieur le Baron\nis doubtless very angry with you, and I am sure that this is chiefly\nbecause he does not know you. For instance, if some one were to tell him\nthat you are a straightforward, courageous young man, a gentleman with\nan unquenchable taste for danger, that you are not a low-born adventurer\nand intriguer, that you have nothing in particular against his\ngovernment, he might not be quite so angry. Pardon me if I say that he\nis not disposed to take your expedition any more seriously than is your\nown Federal government. The little Baron is irascible, choleric, stern,\nor else good-natured, good-hearted, and charitable, just as one happens\nto take him. As we say in France, it is not well to strike flint and\nsteel in his presence. He might blow up and destroy one. Suppose some\none were to go to Monsieur de Carondelet and tell him what a really\nestimable person you are, and assure him that you will go quietly out\nof his province at the first opportunity, and be good, so far as he is\nconcerned, forever after? Mark me, I merely say suppose. I do not know\nhow far things have gone, or what he may have heard. But suppose a\nperson whom I have reason to believe he likes and trusts and respects,\na person who understands his vagaries, should go to him on such an\nerrand.”\n\n“And where is such a person to be found,” said Nick, amused in spite of\nhimself.\n\nMadame la Vicomtesse courtesied.\n\n“Monsieur, she is before you,” she said.\n\n“Egad,” he cried, “do you mean to say, Madame, that you will go to the\nBaron on my behalf?”\n\n“As soon as I ever get to town,” she said. “He will have to be waked\nfrom his siesta, and he does not like that.”\n\n“But he will forgive you,” said Nick, quick as a flash.\n\n“I have reason to believe he will,” said Madame la Vicomtesse.\n\n“Faith,” cried Nick, “he would not be flesh and blood if he didn’t.”\n\nAt that the Vicomtesse laughed, and her eye rested judicially on me. I\nwas standing rather glumly, I fear, in the corner.\n\n“Are you going to take him with you?” said Nick.\n\n“I was thinking of it,” said the Vicomtesse. “Mr. Ritchie knows you, and\nhe is such a reliable and reputable person.”\n\nNick bowed.\n\n“You should have seen him marching in a Jacobin procession, Madame,” he\nsaid.\n\n“He follows his friends into strange places,” she retorted. “And now,\nMr. Temple,” she added, “may we trust you to stay here with Lamarque\nuntil you have word from us?”\n\n“You know I cannot stay here,” he cried.\n\n“And why not, Monsieur?”\n\n“If I were captured here, I should get Monsieur de St. Gré into trouble;\nand besides,” he said, with a touch of coldness, “I cannot be beholden\nto Monsieur de St. Gré. I cannot remain on his land.”\n\n“As for getting Monsieur de St. Gré into trouble, his own son could\nnot involve him with the Baron,” answered Madame la Vicomtesse. “And it\nseems to me, Monsieur, that you are already so far beholden to Monsieur\nde St. Gré that you cannot quibble about going a little more into his\ndebt. Come, Mr. Temple, how has Monsieur de St. Gré ever offended you?”\n\n“Madame--” he began.\n\n“Monsieur,” she said, with an air not to be denied, “I believe I can\ndiscern a point of honor as well as you. I fail to see that you have a\ncase.”\n\nHe was indeed no match for her. He turned to me appealingly, his brows\nbent, but I had no mind to meddle. He swung back to her.\n\n“But Madame--!” he cried.\n\nShe was arranging the cards neatly on the table.\n\n“Monsieur, you are tiresome,” she said. “What is it now?”\n\nHe took a step toward her, speaking in a low tone, his voice shaking.\nBut, true to himself, he spoke plainly. As for me, I looked on\nfrightened,--as though watching a contest,--almost agape to see what a\nclever woman could do.\n\n“There is--Mademoiselle de St. Gré--”\n\n“Yes, there is Mademoiselle de St. Gré,” repeated the Vicomtesse, toying\nwith the cards.\n\nHis face lighted, though his lips twitched with pain.\n\n“She is still--”\n\n“She is still Mademoiselle de St. Gré, Monsieur, if that is what you\nmean.”\n\n“And what will she think if I stay here?”\n\n“Ah, do you care what she thinks, Mr. Temple?” said the Vicomtesse,\nraising her head quickly. “From what I have heard, I should not have\nthought you could.”\n\n“God help me,” he answered simply, “I do care.”\n\nHélène’s eyes softened as she looked at him, and my pride in him was\nnever greater than at that moment.\n\n“Mr. Temple,” she said gently, “remain where you are and have faith in\nus. I begin to see now why you are so fortunate in your friends.” Her\nglance rested for a brief instant on me. “Mr. Ritchie and I will go to\nNew Orleans, talk to the Baron, and send André at once with a message.\nIf it is in our power, you shall see your mother very soon.”\n\nShe held out her hand to him, and he bent and kissed it reverently, with\nan ease I envied. He followed us to the door. And when the Vicomtesse\nhad gone a little way down the path she looked at him over her shoulder.\n\n“Do not despair, Mr. Temple,” she said.\n\nIt was an answer to a yearning in his face. He gripped me by the\nshoulders.\n\n“God bless you, Davy,” he whispered, and added, “God bless you both.”\n\nI overtook her where the path ran into the forest’s shade, and for a\nlong while I walked after her, not breaking her silence, my eyes upon\nher, a strange throbbing in my forehead which I did not heed. At last,\nwhen the perfumes of the flowers told us we were nearing the garden, she\nturned to me.\n\n“I like Mr. Temple,” she said, again.\n\n“He is an honest gentleman,” I answered.\n\n“One meets very few of them,” she said, speaking in a low voice. “You\nand I will go to the Governor. And after that, have you any idea where\nyou will go?”\n\n“No,” I replied, troubled by her regard.\n\n“Then I will tell you. I intend to send you to Madame Gravois’s, and\nshe will compel you to go to bed and rest. I do not mean to allow you to\nkill yourself.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. MONSIEUR LE BARON\n\nThe sun beat down mercilessly on thatch and terrace, the yellow walls\nflung back the quivering heat, as Madame la Vicomtesse and I walked\nthrough the empty streets towards the Governor’s house. We were followed\nby André and Madame’s maid. The sleepy orderly started up from under the\narchway at our approach, bowed profoundly to Madame, looked askance at\nme, and declared, with a thousand regrets, that Monsieur le Baron was\nhaving his siesta.\n\n“Then you will wake him,” said Madame la Vicomtesse.\n\nWake Monsieur le Baron! Bueno Dios, did Madame understand what it meant\nto wake his Excellency? His Excellency would at first be angry, no\ndoubt. Angry? As an Andalusian bull, Madame. Once, when his Excellency\nhad first come to the province, he, the orderly, had presumed to awake\nhim.\n\n“Assez!” said Madame, so suddenly that the man straightened and looked\nat her again. “You will wake Monsieur le Baron, and tell him that Madame\nla Vicomtesse d’Ivry-le-Tour has something of importance to say to him.”\n\nMadame had the air, and a title carried with a Spanish soldier in New\nOrleans in those days. The orderly fairly swept the ground and led us\nthrough a court where the sun drew bewildering hot odors from the fruits\nand flowers, into a darkened room which was the Baron’s cabinet. I\nremember it vaguely, for my head was hot and throbbing from my\nexertions in such a climate. It was a new room,--the hotel being newly\nbuilt,--with white walls, a picture of his Catholic Majesty and\nthe royal arms of Spain, a map of Louisiana, another of New Orleans\nfortified, some walnut chairs, a desk with ink and sand and a seal, and\na window, the closed lattice shutters of which showed streaks of light\ngreen light. These doubtless opened on the Royal Road and looked\nacross the levee esplanade on the waters of the Mississippi. Madame la\nVicomtesse seated herself, and with a gesture which was an order bade me\ndo likewise.\n\n“He will be angry, the dear Baron,” she said. “He is harassed to death\nwith republics. No offence, Mr. Ritchie. He is up at dawn looking to the\nforts and palisades to guard against such foolish enterprises as this\nof Mr. Temple’s. And to be waked out of a well-earned siesta--to save\na gentleman who has come here to make things unpleasant for him--is\ncarrying a joke a little far. Mais--que voulez-vous?”\n\nShe gave a little shrug to her slim shoulders as she smiled at me, and\nshe seemed not a whit disturbed concerning the conversation with his\nExcellency. I wondered whether this were birth, or training, or both, or\na natural ability to cope with affairs. The women of her order had long\nbeen used to intercede with sovereigns, to play a part in matters of\nstate. Suddenly I became aware that she was looking at me.\n\n“What are you thinking of?” she demanded, and continued without waiting\nfor a reply, “you strange man.”\n\n“I was thinking how odd it was,” I replied, “that I should have known\nyou all these years by a portrait, that we should finally be thrown\ntogether, and that you should be so exactly like the person I had\nsupposed you to be.”\n\nShe lowered her eyes, but she did not seem to take offence. I meant\nnone.\n\n“And you,” she answered, “are continually reminding me of an Englishman\nI knew when I was a girl. He was a very queer person to be attached to\nthe Embassy,--not a courtier, but a serious, literal person like you,\nMr. Ritchie, and he resembled you very much. I was very fond of him.”\n\n“And--what became of him?” I asked. Other questions rose to my lips, but\nI put them down.\n\n“I will tell you,” she answered, bending forward a little. “He did\nsomething which I believe you might have done. A certain Marquis spoke\nlightly of a lady, an Englishwoman at our court, and my Englishman ran\nhim through one morning at Versailles.”\n\nShe paused, and I saw that her breath was coming more quickly at the\nremembrance.\n\n“And then?”\n\n“He fled to England. He was a younger son, and poor. But his King heard\nof the affair, had it investigated, and restored him to the service. I\nhave never seen him since,” she said, “but I have often thought of\nhim. There,” she added, after a silence, with a lightness which seemed\nassumed, “I have given you a romance. How long the Baron takes to\ndress!”\n\nAt that moment there were footsteps in the court-yard, and the orderly\nappeared at the door, saluting, and speaking in Spanish.\n\n“His Excellency the Governor!”\n\nWe rose, and Madame was courtesying and I was bowing to the little man.\nHe was in uniform, his face perspiring in the creases, his plump calves\nstretching his white stockings to the full. Madame extended her hand and\nhe kissed it, albeit he did not bend easily. He spoke in French, and his\nvoice betrayed the fact that his temper was near slipping its leash. The\nBaron was a native of Flanders.\n\n“To what happy circumstance do I owe the honor of this visit, Madame la\nVicomtesse?” he asked.\n\n“To a woman’s whim, Monsieur le Baron,” she answered, “for a man would\nnot have dared to disturb you. May I present to your Excellency, Mr.\nDavid Ritchie of Kentucky?”\n\nHis Excellency bowed stiffly, looked at me with no pretence of pleasure,\nand I had had sufficient dealings with men to divine that, in the coming\nconversation, the overflow of his temper would be poured upon me. His\nfirst sensation was surprise.\n\n“An American!” he said, in a tone that implied reproach to Madame\nla Vicomtesse for having fallen into such company. “Ah,” he cried,\nbreathing hard in the manner of stout people, “I remember you came down\nwith Monsieur Vigo, Monsieur, did you not?”\n\nIt was my turn to be surprised. If the Baron took a like cognizance of\nall my countrymen who came to New Orleans, he was a busy man indeed.\n\n“Yes, your Excellency,” I answered.\n\n“And you are a Federalist?” he said, though petulantly.\n\n“I am, your Excellency.”\n\n“Is your nation to overrun the earth?” said the Baron. “Every morning\nwhen I ride through the streets it seems to me that more Americans\nhave come. Pardieu, I declare every day that, if it were not for the\nAmericans, I should have ten years more of life ahead of me.” I could\nnot resist the temptation to glance at Madame la Vicomtesse. Her eyes,\nhalf closed, betrayed an amusement that was scarce repressed.\n\n“Come, Monsieur le Baron,” she said, “you and I have like beliefs upon\nmost matters. We have both suffered at the hands of people who have\nmistaken a fiend for a Lady.”\n\n“You would have me believe, Madame,” the Baron put in, with a wit I had\nnot thought in him, “that Mr. Ritchie knows a lady when he sees one. I\ncan readily believe it.”\n\nMadame laughed.\n\n“He at least has a negative knowledge,” she replied. “And he has brought\ninto New Orleans no coins, boxes, or clocks against your Excellency’s\norders with the image and superscription of the Goddess in whose name\nall things are done. He has not sung ‘Ça Ira’ at the theatres, and he\ndetests the tricolored cockades as much as you do.”\n\nThe Baron laughed in spite of himself, and began to thaw. There was a\nlittle more friendliness in his next glance at me.\n\n“What images have you brought in, Mr. Ritchie?” he asked. “We all\nworship the sex in some form, however misplaced our notions of it.”\n\nThere is not the least doubt that, for the sake of the Vicomtesse, he\nwas trying to be genial, and that his remark was a purely random one.\nBut the roots of my hair seemed to have taken fire. I saw the Baron\nas in a glass, darkly. But I kept my head, principally because the\nsituation had elements of danger.\n\n“The image of Madame la Vicomtesse, Monsieur,” I said.\n\n“Dame!” exclaimed his Excellency, eying me with a new interest, “I did\nnot suspect you of being a courtier.”\n\n“No more he is, Monsieur le Baron,” said the Vicomtesse, “for he speaks\nthe truth.”\n\nHis Excellency looked blank. As for me, I held my breath, wondering what\ncoup Madame was meditating.\n\n“Mr. Ritchie brought down from Kentucky a miniature of me by Boze, that\nwas painted in a costume I once wore at Chantilly.”\n\n“Comment! diable,” exclaimed the Baron. “And how did such a thing get\ninto Kentucky, Madame?”\n\n“You have brought me to the point,” she replied, “which is no small\ntriumph for your Excellency. Mr. Ritchie bought the miniature from that\nmost estimable of my relations, Monsieur Auguste de St. Gré.”\n\nThe Baron sat down and began to fan himself. He even grew a little\npurple. He looked at Madame, sputtered, and I began to think that, if he\ndidn’t relieve himself, his head might blow off. As for the Vicomtesse,\nshe wore an ingenuous air of detachment, and seemed supremely\nunconscious of the volcano by her side.\n\n“So, Madame,” cried the Governor at length, after I know not what\nrepressions, “you have come here in behalf of that--of Auguste de St.\nGré!”\n\n“So far as I am concerned, Monsieur,” answered the Vicomtesse, calmly,\n“you may hang Auguste, put him in prison, drown him, or do anything you\nlike with him.”\n\n“God help me,” said the poor man, searching for his handkerchief, and\nutterly confounded, “why is it you have come to me, then? Why did you\nwake me up?” he added, so far forgetting himself.\n\n“I came in behalf of the gentleman who had the indiscretion to accompany\nAuguste to Louisiana,” she continued, “in behalf of Mr. Nicholas Temple,\nwho is a cousin of Mr. Ritchie.”\n\nThe Baron started abruptly from his chair.\n\n“I have heard of him,” he cried; “Madame knows where he is?”\n\n“I know where he is. It is that which I came to tell your Excellency.”\n\n“Hein!” said his Excellency, again nonplussed. “You came to tell me\nwhere he is? And where the--the other one is?”\n\n“Parfaitement,” said Madame. “But before I tell you where they are, I\nwish to tell you something about Mr. Temple.”\n\n“Madame, I know something of him already,” said the Baron, impatiently.\n\n“Ah,” said she, “from Gignoux. And what do you hear from Gignoux?”\n\nThis was another shock, under which the Baron fairly staggered.\n\n“Diable! is Madame la Vicomtesse in the plot?” he cried. “What does\nMadame know of Gignoux?”\n\nMadame’s manner suddenly froze.\n\n“I am likely to be in the plot, Monsieur,” she said. “I am likely to be\nin a plot which has for its furtherance that abominable anarchy which\ndeprived me of my home and estates, of my relatives and friends and my\nsovereign.”\n\n“A thousand pardons, Madame la Vicomtesse,” said the Baron, more at sea\nthan ever. “I have had much to do these last years, and the heat and\nthe Republicans have got on my temper. Will Madame la Vicomtesse pray\nexplain?”\n\n“I was about to do so when your Excellency interrupted,” said Madame.\n“You see before you Mr. Ritchie, barrister, of Louisville, Kentucky,\nwhose character of sobriety, dependence, and ability” (there was a\nlittle gleam in her eye as she gave me this array of virtues) “can be\nperfectly established. When he came to New Orleans some years ago he\nbrought letters to Monsieur de St. Gré from Monsieur Gratiot and Colonel\nChouteau of St. Louis, and he is known to Mr. Clark and to Monsieur\nVigo. He is a Federalist, as you know, and has no sympathy with the\nJacobins.”\n\n“Eh bien, Mr. Ritchie,” said the Baron, getting his breath, “you are\nfortunate in your advocate. Madame la Vicomtesse neglected to say that\nshe was your friend, the greatest of all recommendations in my eyes.”\n\n“You are delightful, Monsieur le Baron,” said the Vicomtesse.\n\n“Perhaps Mr. Ritchie can tell me something of this expedition,” said the\nBaron, his eyes growing smaller as he looked at me.\n\n“Willingly,” I answered. “Although I know that your Excellency is well\ninformed, and that Monsieur Vigo has doubtless given you many of the\ndetails that I know.”\n\nHe interrupted me with a grunt.\n\n“You Americans are clever people, Monsieur,” he said; “you contrive to\ncombine shrewdness with frankness.”\n\n“If I had anything to hide from your Excellency, I should not be here,”\nI answered. “The expedition, as you know, has been as much of a farce as\nCitizen Genêt’s commissions. But it has been a sad farce to me, inasmuch\nas it involves the honor of my old friend and Colonel, General Clark,\nand the safety of my cousin, Mr. Temple.”\n\n“So you were with Clark in Illinois?” said the Baron, craftily. “Pardon\nme, Mr. Ritchie, but I should have said that you are too young.”\n\n“Monsieur Vigo will tell you that I was the drummer boy of the regiment,\nand a sort of ward of the Colonel’s. I used to clean his guns and cook\nhis food.”\n\n“And you did not see fit to follow your Colonel to Louisiana?” said his\nExcellency, for he had been trained in a service of suspicion.\n\n“General Clark is not what he was,” I replied, chafing a little at his\nmanner; “your Excellency knows that, and I put loyalty to my government\nbefore friendship. And I might remind your Excellency that I am neither\nan adventurer nor a fool.”\n\nThe little Baron surprised me by laughing. His irritability and his good\nnature ran in streaks.\n\n“There is no occasion to, Mr. Ritchie,” he answered. “I have seen\nsomething of men in my time. In which category do you place your cousin,\nMr. Temple?”\n\n“If a love of travel and excitement and danger constitutes an\nadventurer, Mr. Temple is such,” I said. “Fortunately the main spur of\nthe adventurer’s character is lacking in his case. I refer to the\ndesire for money. Mr. Temple has an annuity from his father’s estate in\nCharleston which puts him beyond the pale of the fortune-seeker, and I\nfirmly believe that if your Excellency sees fit to allow him to leave\nthe province, and if certain disquieting elements can be removed from\nhis life” (I glanced at the Vicomtesse), “he will settle down and become\na useful citizen of the United States. As much as I dislike to submit to\na stranger private details in the life of a member of my family, I feel\nthat I must tell your Excellency something of Mr. Temple’s career, in\norder that you may know that restlessness and the thirst for adventure\nwere the only motives that led him into this foolish undertaking.”\n\n“Pray proceed, Mr. Ritchie,” said the Baron.\n\nI was surprised not to find him more restless, and in addition the\nglance of approbation which the Vicomtesse gave me spurred me on.\nHowever distasteful, I had the sense to see that I must hold nothing\nback of which his Excellency might at any time become cognizant, and\ntherefore I told him as briefly as possible Nick’s story, leaving out\nonly the episode with Antoinette. When I came to the relation of the\naffairs which occurred at Les Îles five years before and told his\nExcellency that Mrs. Temple had since been living in the Rue Bourbon as\nMrs. Clive, unknown to her son, the Baron broke in upon me.\n\n“So the mystery of that woman is cleared at last,” he said, and turned\nto the Vicomtesse. “I have learned that you have been a frequent\nvisitor, Madame.”\n\n“Not a sparrow falls to the ground in Louisiana that your Excellency\ndoes not hear of it,” she answered.\n\n“And Gignoux?” he said, speaking to me again.\n\n“As I told you, Monsieur le Baron,” I answered, “I have come to New\nOrleans at a personal sacrifice to induce my cousin to abandon this\nmatter, and I went out last evening to try to get word of him.” This was\nnot strictly true. “I saw Monsieur Gignoux in conference with some of\nyour officers who came out of this hotel.”\n\n“You have sharp eyes, Monsieur,” he remarked.\n\n“I suspected the man when I met him in Kentucky,” I continued, not\nheeding this. “Monsieur Vigo himself distrusted him. To say that Gignoux\nwere deep in the councils of the expedition, that he held a\ncommission from Citizen Genêt, I realize will have no weight with your\nExcellency,--provided the man is in the secret service of his Majesty\nthe King of Spain.”\n\n“Mr. Ritchie,” said the Baron, “you are a young man and I an old one. If\nI tell you that I have a great respect for your astuteness and ability,\ndo not put it down to flattery. I wish that your countrymen, who are\ncoming down the river like driftwood, more resembled you. As for Citizen\nGignoux,” he went on, smiling, and wiping his face, “let not your heart\nbe troubled. His Majesty’s minister at Philadelphia has written me\nletters on the subject. I am contemplating for Monsieur Gignoux a sea\nvoyage to Havana, and he is at present partaking of my hospitality in\nthe calabozo.”\n\n“In the calabozo!” I cried, overwhelmed at this example of Spanish\njustice and omniscience.\n\n“Precisely,” said the Baron, drumming with his fingers on his fat knee.\n“And now,” he added, “perhaps Madame la Vicomtesse is ready to tell me\nof the whereabouts of Mr. Temple and her estimable cousin, Auguste. It\nmay interest her to know why I have allowed them their liberty so long.”\n\n“A point on which I have been consumed with curiosity--since I have\nbegun to tremble at the amazing thoroughness of your Excellency’s\nsystem,” said the Vicomtesse.\n\nHis Excellency scarcely looked the tyrant as he sat before us, with\nhis calves crossed and his hands folded on his waistcoat and his little\nblack eyes twinkling.\n\n“It is because,” he said, “there are many French planters in the\nprovince bitten with the three horrors” (he meant Liberty, Equality, and\nFraternity), “I sent six to Havana; and if Monsieur Étienne de Boré had\nnot, in the nick of time for him, discovered how to make sugar he would\nhave gone, too. I had an idea that the Sieur de St. Gré and Mr. Temple\nmight act as a bait to reveal the disease in some others. Ha, I am\ncleverer than you thought, Mr. Ritchie. You are surprised?”\n\nI was surprised, and showed it.\n\n“Come,” he said, “you are astute. Why did you think I left them at\nliberty?”\n\n“I thought your Excellency believed them to be harmless, as they are,” I\nreplied.\n\nHe turned again to the Vicomtesse. “You have picked up a diplomat,\nMadame. I must confess that I misjudged him when you introduced him to\nme. And again, where are Mr. Temple and your estimable cousin? Shall I\ntell you? They are at old Lamarque’s, on the plantation of Philippe de\nSt. Gré.”\n\n“They were, your Excellency,” said the Vicomtesse.\n\n“Eh?” exclaimed the Baron, jumping.\n\n“Mademoiselle de St. Gré has given her brother eight hundred livres, and\nhe is probably by this time on board a French ship at the English\nTurn. He is very badly frightened. I will give your Excellency one more\nsurprise.”\n\n“Madame la Vicomtesse,” said the Baron, “I have heard that, but for your\ncoolness and adroitness, Monsieur le Vicomte, your husband, and several\nother noblemen and their ladies and some of her Majesty’s letters and\njewels would never have gotten out of France. I take this opportunity of\nsaying that I have the greatest respect for your intelligence. Now what\nis the surprise?”\n\n“That your Excellency intended that both Mr. Temple and Auguste de St.\nGré were to escape on that ship.”\n\n“Mille tonneres,” exclaimed the Baron, staring at her, and straightway\nhe fell into a fit of laughter that left him coughing and choking and\nperspiring as only a man in his condition of flesh can perspire. To say\nthat I was bewildered by this last evidence of the insight of the woman\nbeside me would be to put it mildly. The Vicomtesse sat quietly watching\nhim, the wonted look of repressed laughter on her face, and by degrees\nhis Excellency grew calm again.\n\n“Mon Dieu,” said he, “I always like to cross swords with you, Madame la\nVicomtesse, yet this encounter has been more pleasurable than any I have\nhad since I came to Louisiana. But, diable,” he cried, “just as I was\ncongratulating myself that I was to have one American the less, you come\nand tell me that he has refused to flee. Out of consideration for the\ncharacter and services of Monsieur Philippe de St. Gré I was willing to\nlet them both escape. But now?”\n\n“Mr. Temple is not known in New Orleans except to the St. Gré family,”\nsaid the Vicomtesse. “He is a man of honor. Suppose Mr. Ritchie were to\nbring him to your Excellency, and he were to give you his word that he\nwould leave the province at the first opportunity? He now wishes to\nsee his mother before she dies, and it was as much as we could do this\nmorning to persuade him from going to her openly in the face of arrest.”\n\nBut the Baron was old in a service which did not do things hastily.\n\n“He is well enough where he is for to-day,” said his Excellency,\nresuming his official manner. “To-night after dark I will send down\nan officer and have him brought before me. He will not then be seen in\ncustody by any one, and provided I am satisfied with him he may go to\nthe Rue Bourbon.”\n\nThe little Baron rose and bowed to the Vicomtesse to signify that the\naudience was ended, and he added, as he kissed her hand, “Madame la\nVicomtesse, it is a pleasure to be able to serve such a woman as you.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. THE SCOURGE\n\n\nAs we went through the court I felt as though I had been tied to a\nstring, suspended in the air, and spun. This was undoubtedly due to the\nheat. And after the astonishing conversation from which we had come, my\nadmiration for the lady beside me was magnified to a veritable awe. We\nreached the archway. Madame la Vicomtesse held me lightly by the edge of\nmy coat, and I stood looking down at her.\n\n“Wait a minute, Mr. Ritchie,” she said, glancing at the few figures\nhurrying across the Place d’Armes; “those are only Americans, and they\nare too busy to see us standing here. What do you propose to do now?”\n\n“We must get word to Nick as we promised, that he may know what to\nexpect,” I replied. “Suppose we go to Monsieur de St. Gré’s house and\nwrite him a letter?”\n\n“No,” said the Vicomtesse, with decision, “I am going to Mrs. Temple’s.\nI shall write the letter from there and send it by André, and you will\ngo direct to Madame Gravois’s.”\n\nHer glance rested anxiously upon my face, and there came an expression\nin her eyes which disturbed me strangely. I had not known it since the\ndays when Polly Ann used to mother me. But I did not mean to give up.\n\n“I am not tired, Madame la Vicomtesse,” I answered, “and I will go with\nyou to Mrs. Temple’s.”\n\n“Give me your hand,” she said, and smiled. “André and my maid are used\nto my vagaries, and your own countrymen will not mind. Give me your\nhand, Mr. Ritchie.”\n\nI gave it willingly enough, with a thrill as she took it between\nher own. The same anxious look was in her eyes, and not the least\nembarrassment.\n\n“There, it is hot and dry, as I feared,” she said, “and you seem\nflushed.” She dropped my hand, and there was a touch of irritation in\nher voice as she continued: “You seemed fairly sensible when I first\nmet you last night, Mr. Ritchie. Are you losing your sanity? Do you not\nrealize that you cannot take liberties with this climate? Do as I say,\nand go to Madame Gravois’s at once.”\n\n“It is my pleasure to obey you, Madame la Vicomtesse,” I answered, “but\nI mean to go with you as far as Mrs. Temple’s, to see how she fares. She\nmay be--worse.”\n\n“That is no reason why you should kill yourself,” said Madame, coldly.\n“Will you not do as I say?”\n\n“I think that I should go to Mrs. Temple’s,” I answered.\n\nShe did not reply to that, letting down her veil impatiently, with a\ndeftness that characterized all her movements. Without so much as asking\nme to come after her, she reached the banquette, and I walked by her\nside through the streets, silent and troubled by her displeasure. My\npride forbade me to do as she wished. It was the hottest part of a\nburning day, and the dome of the sky was like a brazen bell above us.\nWe passed the the calabozo with its iron gates and tiny grilled windows\npierced in the massive walls, behind which Gignoux languished, and\nI could not repress a smile as I thought of him. Even the Spaniards\nsometimes happened upon justice. In the Rue Bourbon the little shops\nwere empty, the doorstep where my merry fiddler had played vacant, and\nthe very air seemed to simmer above the honeycombed tiles. I knocked\nat the door, once, twice. There was no answer. I looked at Madame la\nVicomtesse, and knocked again so loudly that the little tailor across\nthe street, his shirt opened at the neck, flung out his shutter.\nSuddenly there was a noise within, the door was opened, and Lindy stood\nbefore us, in the darkened room, with terror in her eyes.\n\n“Oh, Marse Dave,” she cried, as we entered, “oh, Madame, I’se so glad\nyou’se come, I’se so glad you’se come.”\n\nShe burst into a flood of tears. And Madame la Vicomtesse, raising her\nveil, seized the girl by the arm.\n\n“What is it?” she said. “What is the matter, Lindy?”\n\nMadame’s touch seemed to steady her.\n\n“Miss Sally,” she moaned, “Miss Sally done got de yaller fever.”\n\nThere was a moment’s silence, for we were both too appalled by the news\nto speak.\n\n“Lindy, are you sure?” said the Vicomtesse.\n\n“Yass’m, yass’m,” Lindy sobbed, “I reckon I’se done seed ‘nuf of it,\nMistis.” And she went into a hysterical fit of weeping.\n\nThe Vicomtesse turned to her own frightened servants in the doorway,\nbade André in French to run for Dr. Perrin, and herself closed the\nbattened doors. There was a moment when her face as I saw it was graven\non my memory, reflecting a knowledge of the evils of this world, a\nspirit above and untouched by them, a power to accept what life may\nbring with no outward sign of pleasure or dismay. Doubtless thus she had\nmade King and Cardinal laugh, doubtless thus, ministering to those who\ncrossed her path, she had met her own calamities. Strangest of all was\nthe effect she had upon Lindy, for the girl ceased crying as she watched\nher.\n\nMadame la Vicomtesse turned to me.\n\n“You must go at once,” she said. “When you get to Madame Gravois’s,\nwrite to Mr. Temple. I will send André to you there.”\n\nShe started for the bedroom door, Lindy making way for her. I scarcely\nknew what I did as I sprang forward and took the Vicomtesse by the arm.\n\n“Where are you going?” I cried. “You cannot go in there! You cannot go\nin there!”\n\nIt did not seem strange that she turned to me without anger, that she\ndid not seek to release her arm. It did not seem strange that her look\nhad in it a gentleness as she spoke.\n\n“I must,” she said.\n\n“I cannot let you risk your life,” I cried, wholly forgetting myself;\n“there are others who will do this.”\n\n“Others?” she said.\n\n“I will go. I--I have nursed people before this. And there is Lindy.”\n\nA smile quivered on her lips,--or was it a smile?\n\n“You will do as I say and go to Madame Gravois’s--at once,” she\nmurmured, striving for the first time to free herself.\n\n“If you stay, I stay,” I answered; “and if you die, I die.”\n\nShe looked up into my eyes for a fleeting instant.\n\n“Write to Mr. Temple,” she said.\n\nDazed, I watched her open the bedroom doors, motion to Lindy to pass\nthrough, and then she had closed them again and I was alone in the\ndarkened parlor.\n\nThe throbbing in my head was gone, and a great clearness had come with\na great fear. I stood, I know not how long, listening to the groans\nthat came through the wall, for Mrs. Temple was in agony. At intervals\nI heard Hélène’s voice, and then the groans seemed to stop. Ten times\nI went to the bedroom door, and as many times drew away again, my heart\nleaping within me at the peril which she faced. If I had had the right,\nI believe I would have carried her away by force.\n\nBut I had not the right. I sat down heavily, by the table, to think, and\nit might have been a cry of agony sharper than the rest that reminded me\nonce more of the tragedy of the poor lady in torture. My eye fell upon\nthe table, and there, as though prepared for what I was to do, lay pen\nand paper, ink and sand. My hand shook as I took the quill and tried to\ncompose a letter to my cousin. I scarcely saw the words which I put on\nthe sheet, and I may be forgiven for the unwisdom of that which I wrote.\n\n“The Baron de Carondelet will send an officer for you to-night so that\nyou may escape observation in custody. His Excellency knew of your\nhiding-place, but is inclined to be lenient, will allow you to-morrow\nto go to the Rue Bourbon, and will without doubt permit you to leave the\nprovince. Your mother is ill, and Madame la Vicomtesse and myself are\nwith her. “DAVID.”\n\nIn the state I was it took me a long time to compose this much, and I\nhad barely finished it when there was a knock at the outer door. There\nwas André. He had the immobility of face which sometimes goes with the\nmulatto, and always with the trained servant, as he informed me that\nMonsieur le Médecin was not at home, but that he had left word. There\nwas an epidemic, Monsieur, so André feared. I gave him the note and his\ndirections, and ten minutes after he had gone I would have given much to\nhave called him back. How about Antoinette, alone at Les Îles? Why had\nI not thought of her? We had told her nothing that morning, Madame la\nVicomtesse and I, after our conference with Nick. For the girl had shut\nherself in her room, and Madame had thought it best not to disturb her\nat such a stage. But would she not be alarmed when Hélène failed to\nreturn that night? Had circumstances been different, I myself would have\nridden to Les Îles, but no inducement now could make me desert the post\nI had chosen. After many years I dislike to recall to memory that long\nafternoon which I spent, helpless, in the Rue Bourbon. Now I was on my\nfeet, pacing restlessly the short breadth of the room, trying to shut\nout from my mind the horrors of which my ears gave testimony. Again, in\nthe intervals of quiet, I sat with my elbows on the table and my head in\nmy hands, striving to allay the throbbing in my temples. Pains came and\nwent, and at times I felt like a fagot flung into the fire,--I, who had\nnever known a sick day. At times my throat pained me, an odd symptom\nin a warm climate. Troubled as I was in mind and body, the thought of\nHélène’s quiet heroism upheld me through it all. More than once I had my\nhand raised to knock at the bedroom door and ask if I could help, but I\ndared not; at length, the sun having done its worst and spent its fury,\nI began to hear steps along the banquette and voices almost at my elbow\nbeyond the little window. At every noise I peered out, hoping for the\ndoctor. But he did not come. And then, as I fell back into the fauteuil,\nthere was borne on my consciousness a sound I had heard before. It was\nthe music of the fiddler, it was a tune I knew, and the voices of the\nchildren were singing the refrain:--\n\n “Ne sait quand reviendra,\n Ne sait quand reviendra.”\n\nI rose, opened the door, and slipped out of it, and I must have made a\nstrange, hatless figure as I came upon the fiddler and his children from\nacross the street.\n\n“Stop that noise,” I cried in French, angered beyond all reason at the\nthought of music at such a time. “Idiots, there is yellow fever there.”\n\nThe little man stopped with his bow raised; for a moment they all stared\nat me, transfixed. It was a little elf in blue indienne who jumped first\nand ran down the street, crying the news in a shrill voice, the others\nfollowing, the fiddler gazing stupidly after them. Suddenly he scrambled\nup, moaning, as if the scourge itself had fastened on him, backed into\nthe house, and slammed the door in my face. I returned with slow\nsteps to shut myself in the darkened room again, and I recall feeling\nsomething of triumph over the consternation I had caused. No sounds came\nfrom the bedroom, and after that the street was quiet as death save for\nan occasional frightened, hurrying footfall. I was tired.\n\nAll at once the bedroom door opened softly, and Hélène was standing\nthere, looking at me. At first I saw her dimly, as in a vision, then\nclearly. I leaped to my feet and went and stood beside her.\n\n“The doctor has not come,” I said. “Where does he live? I will go for\nhim.”\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“He can do no good. Lindy has procured all the remedies, such as they\nare. They can only serve to alleviate,” she answered. “She cannot\nwithstand this, poor lady.” There were tears on Hélène’s lashes. “Her\nsufferings have been frightful--frightful.”\n\n“Cannot I help?” I said thickly. “Cannot I do something?”\n\nShe shook her head. She raised her hand timidly to the lapel of my coat,\nand suddenly I felt her palm, cool and firm, upon my forehead. It rested\nthere but an instant.\n\n“You ought not to be here,” she said, her voice vibrant with earnestness\nand concern. “You ought not to be here. Will you not go--if I ask it?”\n\n“I cannot,” I said; “you know I cannot if you stay.”\n\nShe did not answer that. Our eyes met, and in that instant for me there\nwas neither joy nor sorrow, sickness nor death, nor time nor space nor\nuniverse. It was she who turned away.\n\n“Have you written him?” she asked in a low voice.\n\n“Yes,” I answered.\n\n“She would not have known him,” said Hélène; “after all these years of\nwaiting she would not have known him. Her punishment has been great.”\n\nA sound came from the bedroom, and Hélène was gone, silently, as she had\ncome.\n\nI must have been dozing in the fauteuil, for suddenly I found myself\nsitting up, listening to an unwonted noise. I knew from the count of the\nhoof-beats which came from down the street that a horse was galloping in\nlong strides--a spent horse, for the timing was irregular. Then he was\npulled up into a trot, then to a walk as I ran to the door and opened\nit and beheld Nicholas Temple flinging himself from a pony white with\nlather. And he was alone! He caught sight of me as soon as his foot\ntouched the banquette.\n\n“What are you doing here?” I cried. “What are you doing here?”\n\nHe halted on the edge of the banquette as a hurrying man runs into a\nwall. He had been all excitement, all fury, as he jumped from his horse;\nand now, as he looked at me, he seemed to lose his bearings, to be all\nbewilderment. He cried out my name and stood looking at me like a fool.\n\n“What the devil do you mean by coming here?” I cried. “Did I not write\nyou to stay where you were? How did you get here?” I stepped down on the\nbanquette and seized him by the shoulders. “Did you receive my letter?”\n\n“Yes,” he said, “yes.” For a moment that was as far as he got, and he\nglanced down the street and then at the heaving beast he had ridden,\nwhich stood with head drooping to the kennel. Then he laid hold of me.\n“Davy, is it true that she has yellow fever? Is it true?”\n\n“Who told you?” I demanded angrily.\n\n“André,” he answered. “André said that the lady here had yellow fever.\nIs it true?”\n\n“Yes,” I said almost inaudibly.\n\nHe let his hand fall from my shoulder, and he shivered.\n\n“May God forgive me for what I have done!” he said. “Where is she?”\n\n“For what you have done?” I cried; “you have done an insensate thing\nto come here.” Suddenly I remembered the sentry at the gate of Fort St.\nCharles. “How did you get into the city?” I said; “were you mad to defy\nthe Baron and his police?”\n\n“Damn the Baron and his police,” he answered, striving to pass me. “Let\nme in! Let me see her.”\n\nEven as he spoke I caught sight of men coming into the street, perhaps\nat the corner of the Rue St. Pierre, and then more men, and as we went\ninto the house I saw that they were running. I closed the doors. There\nwere cries in the street now, but he did not seem to heed them. He stood\nlistening, heart-stricken, to the sounds that came through the bedroom\nwall, and a spasm crossed his face. Then he turned like a man not to be\ndenied, to the bedroom door. I was before him, but Madame la Vicomtesse\nopened it. And I remember feeling astonishment that she did not show\nsurprise or alarm.\n\n“What are you doing here, Mr. Temple?” she said.\n\n“My mother, Madame! My mother! I must go to her.”\n\nHe pushed past her into the bedroom, and I followed perforce. I shall\nnever forget the scene, though I had but the one glimpse of it,--the\nraving, yellowed woman in the bed, not a spectre nor yet even a\nsemblance of the beauty of Temple Bow. But she was his mother, upon\nwhom God had brought such a retribution as He alone can bestow. Lindy,\nfaithful servant to the end, held the wasted hands of her mistress\nagainst the violence they would have done. Lindy held them, her own\nbody rocking with grief, her lips murmuring endearments, prayers,\nsupplications.\n\n“Miss Sally, honey, doan you know Lindy? Gawd’ll let you git well,\nMiss Sally, Gawd’ll let you git well, honey, ter see Marse Nick--ter\nsee--Marse--Nick--”\n\nThe words died on Lindy’s lips, the ravings of the frenzied woman\nceased. The yellowed hands fell limply to the sheet, the shrunken form\nstiffened. The eyes of the mother looked upon the son, and in them at\nfirst was the terror of one who sees the infinite. Then they softened\nuntil they became again the only feature that was left of Sarah Temple.\nNow, as she looked at him who was her pride, her honor, for one sight\nof whom she had prayed,--ay, and even blasphemed,--her eyes were all\ntenderness. Then she spoke.\n\n“Harry,” she said softly, “be good to me, dear. You are all I have now.”\n\nShe spoke of Harry Riddle!\n\nBut the long years of penance had not been in vain. Nick had forgiven\nher. We saw him kneeling at the bedside, we saw him with her hand in\nhis, and Hélène was drawing me gently out of the room and closing the\ndoor behind her. She did not look at me, nor I at her.\n\nWe stood for a moment close together, and suddenly the cries in the\nstreet brought us back from the drama in the low-ceiled, reeking room we\nhad left.\n\n“Ici! Ici! Voici le cheval!”\n\nThere was a loud rapping at the outer door, and a voice demanding\nadmittance in Spanish in the name of his Excellency the Governor.\n\n“Open it,” said Hélène. There was neither excitement in her voice, nor\nyet resignation. In those two words was told the philosophy of her life.\n\nI opened the door. There, on the step, was an officer, perspiring,\nuniformed and plumed, and behind him a crowd of eager faces, white and\nblack, that seemed to fill the street. He took a step into the room, his\nhand on the hilt of his sword, and poured out at me a torrent of Spanish\nof which I understood nothing. All at once his eye fell upon Hélène, who\nwas standing behind me, and he stopped in the middle of his speech and\npulled off his hat and bowed profoundly.\n\n“Madame la Vicomtesse!” he stammered. I was no little surprised that she\nshould be so well known.\n\n“You will please to speak French, Monsieur,” she said; “this gentleman\ndoes not understand Spanish. What is it you desire?”\n\n“A thousand pardons, Madame la Vicomtesse,” he said. “I am the Alcalde\nde Barrio, and a wild Americano has passed the sentry at St. Charles’s\ngate without heeding his Excellency’s authority and command. I saw the\nman with my own eyes. I should know him again in a hundred. We have\ntraced him here to this house, Madame la Vicomtesse. Behold the horse\nwhich he rode!” The Alcalde turned and pointed at the beast. “Behold the\nhorse which he rode, Madame la Vicomtesse. The animal will die.”\n\n“Probably,” answered the Vicomtesse, in an even tone.\n\n“But the man,” cried the Alcalde, “the man is here, Madame la\nVicomtesse, here, in this house!”\n\n“Yes,” she said, “he is here.”\n\n“Sancta Maria! Madame,” he exclaimed, “I--I who speak to you have come\nto get him. He has defied his Excellency’s commands. Where is he?”\n\n“He is in that room,” said the Vicomtesse, pointing at the bedroom door.\n\nThe Alcalde took a step forward. She stopped him by a quick gesture.\n\n“He is in that room with his mother,” she said, “and his mother has the\nyellow fever. Come, we will go to him.” And she put her hand upon the\ndoor.\n\n“Yellow fever!” cried the Alcalde, and his voice was thick with terror.\nThere was a moment’s silence as he stood rooted to the floor. I did\nnot wonder then, but I have since thought it remarkable that the words\nspoken low by both of them should have been caught up on the banquette\nand passed into the street. Impassive, I heard it echoed from a score of\nthroats, I saw men and women stampeding like frightened sheep, I heard\ntheir footfalls and their cries as they ran. A tawdry constable,\nwho held with a trembling hand the bridle of the tired horse, alone\nremained.\n\n“Yellow fever!” the Alcalde repeated\n\nThe Vicomtesse inclined her head.\n\nHe was silent again for a while, uncertain, and then, without\ncomprehending, I saw the man’s eyes grow smaller and a smile play about\nhis mouth. He looked at the Vicomtesse with a new admiration to which\nshe paid no heed.\n\n“I am sorry, Madame la Vicomtesse,” he began, “but--”\n\n“But you do not believe that I speak the truth,” she replied quietly.\n\nHe winced.\n\n“Will you follow me?” she said, turning again.\n\nHe had started, plainly in an agony of fear, when a sound came from\nbeyond the wall that brought a cry to his lips.\n\nHer manner changed to one of stinging scorn.\n\n“You are a coward,” she said. “I will bring the gentleman to you if he\ncan be got to leave the bedside.”\n\n“No,” said the Alcalde, “no. I--I will go to him, Madame la Vicomtesse.”\n\nBut she did not open the door.\n\n“Listen,” she said in a tone of authority, “I myself have been to his\nExcellency to-day concerning this gentleman--”\n\n“You, Madame la Vicomtesse?”\n\n“I will open the door,” she continued, impatient at the interruption,\n“and you will see him. Then I shall write a letter which you will take\nto the Governor. The gentleman will not try to escape, for his mother\nis dying. Besides, he could not get out of the city. You may leave your\nconstable where he is, or the man may come in and stand at this door in\nsight of the gentleman while you are gone--if he pleases.”\n\n“And then?” said the Alcalde.\n\n“It is my belief that his Excellency will allow the gentleman to remain\nhere, and that you will be relieved from the necessity of running any\nfurther risk.”\n\nAs she spoke she opened the door, softly. The room was still now, still\nas death, and the Alcalde went forward on tiptoe. I saw him peering in,\nI saw him backing away again like a man in mortal fear.\n\n“Yes, it is he--it is the man,” he stammered. He put his hand to his\nbrow.\n\nThe Vicomtesse closed the door, and without a glance at him went quickly\nto the table and began to write. She had no thought of consulting the\nman again, of asking his permission. Although she wrote rapidly, five\nminutes must have gone by before the note was finished and folded and\nsealed. She held it out to him.\n\n“Take this to his Excellency,” she said, “and bring me his answer.” The\nAlcalde bowed, murmured her title, and went lamely out of the house. He\nwas plainly in an agony of uncertainty as to his duty, but he glanced\nat the Vicomtesse--and went, flipping the note nervously with his finger\nnail. He paused for a few low-spoken words with the tawdry constable,\nwho sat down on the banquette after his chief had gone, still clinging\nto the bridle. The Vicomtesse went to the doorway, looked at him, and\nclosed the battened doors. The constable did not protest. The day was\nfading without, and the room was almost in darkness as she crossed over\nto the little mantel and stood with her head laid upon her arm.\n\nI did not disturb her. The minutes passed, the light waned until I could\nsee her no longer, and yet I knew that she had not moved. The strange\nsympathy between us kept me silent until I heard her voice calling my\nname.\n\n“Yes,” I answered.\n\n“The candle!”\n\nI drew out my tinder-box and lighted the wick. She had turned, and was\nfacing me even as she had faced me the night before. The night before!\nThe greatest part of my life seemed to have passed since then. I\nremember wondering that she did not look tired. Her face was sad, her\nvoice was sad, and it had an ineffable, sweet quality at such times that\nwas all its own.\n\n“The Alcalde should be coming back,” she said.\n\n“Yes,” I answered.\n\nThese were our words, yet we scarce heeded their meaning. Between us was\ndrawn a subtler communion than speech, and we dared--neither of us--to\nrisk speech. She searched my face, but her lips were closed. She did not\ntake my hand again as in the afternoon. She turned away. I knew what she\nwould have said.\n\nThere was a knock at the door. We went together to open it, and the\nAlcalde stood on the step. He held in his hand a long letter on which\nthe red seal caught the light, and he gave the letter to the Vicomtesse,\nwith a bow.\n\n“From his Excellency, Madame la Vicomtesse.”\n\nShe broke the seal, went to the table, and read. Then she looked up at\nme.\n\n“It is the Governor’s permit for Mr. Temple to remain in this house.\nThank you,” she said to the Alcalde; “you may go.”\n\n“With my respectful wishes for the continued good health of Madame la\nVicomtesse,” said the Alcalde.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. “IN THE MIDST OF LIFE”\n\nThe Alcalde had stopped on the step with an exclamation at something in\nthe darkness outside, and he backed, bowing, into the room again to make\nway for some one. A lady, slim, gowned and veiled in black and followed\nby a negress, swept past him. The lady lifted her veil and stood before\nus.\n\n“Antoinette!” exclaimed the Vicomtesse, going to her.\n\nThe girl did not answer at once. Her suffering seemed to have brought\nupon her a certain acceptance of misfortune as inevitable. Her face,\nframed in the black veil, was never more beautiful than on that night.\n\n“What is the Alcalde doing here?” she said.\n\nThe officer himself answered the question.\n\n“I am leaving, Mademoiselle,” said he. He reached out his hands toward\nher, appealingly. “Do you not remember me, Mademoiselle? You brought the\ngood sister to see my wife.”\n\n“I remember you,” said Antoinette.\n\n“Do not stay here, Mademoiselle!” he cried. “There is--there is yellow\nfever.”\n\n“So that is it,” said Antoinette, unheeding him and looking at her\ncousin. “She has yellow fever, then?”\n\n“I beg you to come away, Mademoiselle!” the man entreated.\n\n“Please go,” she said to him. He looked at her, and went out silently,\nclosing the doors after him. “Why was he here?” she asked again.\n\n“He came to get Mr. Temple, my dear,” said the Vicomtesse. The girl’s\nlips framed his name, but did not speak it.\n\n“Where is he?” she asked slowly.\n\nThe Vicomtesse pointed towards the bedroom.\n\n“In there,” she answered, “with his mother.”\n\n“He came to her?” Antoinette asked quite simply.\n\nThe Vicomtesse glanced at me, and drew the veil gently from the girl’s\nshoulders. She led her, unresisting, to a chair. I looked at them. The\ndifference in their ages was not so great. Both had suffered cruelly;\none had seen the world, the other had not, and yet the contrast lay not\nhere. Both had followed the gospel of helpfulness to others, but one\nas a religieuse, innocent of the sin around her, though poignant of the\nsorrow it caused. The other, knowing evil with an insight that went far\nbeyond intuition, fought with that, too.\n\n“I will tell you, Antoinette,” began the Vicomtesse; “it was as you\nsaid. Mr. Ritchie and I found him at Lamarque’s. He had not taken your\nmoney; he did not even know that Auguste had gone to see you. He did\nnot even know,” she said, bending over the girl, “that he was on your\nfather’s plantation. When we told him that, he would have left it at\nonce.”\n\n“Yes,” she said.\n\n“He did not know that his mother was still in New Orleans. And when we\ntold him how ill she was he would have come to her then. It was as much\nas we could do to persuade him to wait until we had seen Monsieur\nde Carondelet. Mr. Ritchie and I came directly to town and saw his\nExcellency.”\n\nIt was characteristic of the Vicomtesse that she told this almost with\na man’s brevity, that she omitted the stress and trouble and pain of it\nall. These things were done; the tact and skill and character of her who\nhad accomplished them were not spoken of. The girl listened immovable,\nher lips parted and her eyes far away. Suddenly, with an awakening, she\nturned to Hélène.\n\n“You did this!” she cried.\n\n“Mr. Ritchie and I together,” said the Vicomtesse.\n\nHer next exclamation was an odd one, showing how the mind works at such\na time.\n\n“But his Excellency was having his siesta!” said Antoinette.\n\nAgain Hélène glanced at me, but I cannot be sure that she smiled.\n\n“We thought the matter of sufficient importance to awake his\nExcellency,” said Hélène.\n\n“And his Excellency?” asked Antoinette. In that moment all three of us\nseemed to have forgotten the tragedy behind the wall.\n\n“His Excellency thought so, too, when we had explained it sufficiently,”\n Hélène answered.\n\nThe girl seemed suddenly to throw off the weight of her grief. She\nseized the hand of the Vicomtesse in both of her own.\n\n“The Baron pardoned him?” she cried. “Tell me what his Excellency said.\nWhy are you keeping it from me?”\n\n“Hush, my dear,” said the Vicomtesse. “Yes, he pardoned him. Mr. Temple\nwas to have come to the city to-night with an officer. Mr. Ritchie and I\ncame to this house together, and we found--”\n\n“Yes, yes,” said Antoinette.\n\n“Mr. Ritchie wrote to Mr. Temple that his Excellency was to send for him\nto-night, but André told him of the fever, and he came here in the face\nof danger to see her before she died. He galloped past the sentry at the\ngate, and the Alcalde followed him from there.”\n\n“And came here to arrest him?” cried Antoinette. Before the Vicomtesse\ncould prevent her she sprang from her chair, ran to the door, and was\npeering out into the darkness. “Is the Alcalde waiting?”\n\n“No, no,” said the Vicomtesse, gently bringing her back. “I wrote to his\nExcellency and we have his permission for Mr. Temple to remain here.”\n\nSuddenly Antoinette stopped in the middle of the floor, facing the\ncandle, her hands clasped, her eyes wide with fear. We started, Hélène\nand I, as we looked at her.\n\n“What is it, my dear?” said the Vicomtesse, laying a hand on her arm.\n\n“He will take it,” she said, “he will take the fever.”\n\nA strange thing happened. Many, many times have I thought of it since,\nand I did not know its meaning then. I had looked to see the Vicomtesse\ncomfort her. But Hélène took a step towards me, my eyes met hers, and\nin them reflected was the terror I had seen in Antoinette’s. At that\ninstant I, too, forgot the girl, and we turned to see that she had sunk\ndown, weeping, in the chair. Then we both went to her, I through some\ninstinct I did not fathom.\n\nHélène’s hand, resting on Antoinette’s shoulder, trembled there. It\nmay well have been my own weakness which made me think her body swayed,\nwhich made me reach out as if to catch her. However marvellous her\nstrength and fortitude, these could not last forever. And--Heaven help\nme--my own were fast failing. Once the room had seemed to me all in\ndarkness. Then I saw the Vicomtesse leaning tenderly over her cousin and\nwhispering in her ear, and Antoinette rising, clinging to her.\n\n“I will go,” she faltered, “I will go. He must not know I have been\nhere. You--you will not tell him?”\n\n“No, I shall not tell him,” answered the Vicomtesse.\n\n“And--you will send word to me, Hélène?”\n\n“Yes, dear.”\n\nAntoinette kissed her, and began to adjust her veil mechanically. I\nlooked on, bewildered by the workings of the feminine mind. Why was she\ngoing? The Vicomtesse gave me no hint. But suddenly the girl’s arms fell\nto her sides, and she stood staring, not so much as a cry escaping her.\nThe bedroom doors had been opened, and between them was the tall figure\nof Nicholas Temple. So they met again after many years, and she who had\nparted them had brought them together once more. He came a step into\nthe room, as though her eyes had drawn him so far. Even then he did not\nspeak her name.\n\n“Go,” he said. “Go, you must not stay here. Go!”\n\nShe bowed her head.\n\n“I was going,” she answered. “I--I am going.”\n\n“But you must go at once,” he cried excitedly. “Do you know what is in\nthere?” and he pointed towards the bedroom.\n\n“Yes, yes, I know,” she said, “I know.”\n\n“Then go,” he cried. “As it is you have risked too much.”\n\nShe lifted up her head and looked at him. There was a new-born note in\nher voice, a tremulous note of joy in the midst of sorrow. It was of her\nhe was thinking!\n\n“And you?” she said. “You have come and remained.”\n\n“She is my mother,” he answered. “God knows it was the least I could\nhave done.”\n\nTwice she had changed before our eyes, and now we beheld a new and yet\nmore startling transformation. When she spoke there was no reproach in\nher voice, but triumph. Antoinette undid her veil.\n\n“Yes, she is your mother,” she answered; “but for many years she has\nbeen my friend. I will go to her. She cannot forbid me now. Hélène has\nbeen with her,” she said, turning to where the Vicomtesse stood watching\nher intently. “Hélène has been with her. And shall I, who have longed to\nsee her these many years, leave her now?”\n\n“But you were going!” he cried, beside himself with apprehension at this\nnew turning. “You told me that you were going.”\n\nTruly, man is born without perception.\n\n“Yes, I told you that,” she replied almost defiantly.\n\n“And why were you going?” he demanded. Then I had a sudden desire to\nshake him.\n\nAntoinette was mute.\n\n“You yourself must find the answer to that question, Mr. Temple,” said\nthe Vicomtesse, quietly.\n\nHe turned and stared at Hélène, and she seemed to smile. Then as his\neyes went back, irresistibly, to the other, a light that was wonderful\nto see dawned and grew in them. I shall never forget him as he stood,\nhandsome and fearless, a gentleman still, despite his years of wandering\nand adventure, and in this supreme moment unselfish. The wilful,\nmasterful boy had become a man at last.\n\nHe started forward, stopped, trembling with a shock of remembrance, and\ngave back again.\n\n“You cannot come,” he said; “I cannot let you take this risk. Tell her\nshe cannot come, Madame,” he said to Hélène. “For the love of God send\nher home again.”\n\nBut there were forces which even Hélène could not stem. He had turned to\ngo back, he had seized the door, but Antoinette was before him. Custom\ndoes not weigh at such a time. Had she not read his avowal? She had his\nhand in hers, heedless of us who watched. At first he sought to free\nhimself, but she clung to it with all the strength of her love,--yet she\ndid not look up at him.\n\n“I will come with you,” she said in a low voice, “I will come with you,\nNick.”\n\nHow quaintly she spoke his name, and gently, and timidly--ay, and with\na supreme courage. True to him through all those numb years of waiting,\nthis was a little thing--that they should face death together. A little\nthing, and yet the greatest joy that God can bestow upon a good woman.\nHe looked down at her with a great tenderness, he spoke her name, and I\nknew that he had taken her at last into his arms.\n\n“Come,” he said.\n\nThey went in together, and the doors closed behind them.\n\nAntoinette’s maid was on the step, and the Vicomtesse and I were alone\nonce more in the little parlor. I remember well the sense of unreality\nI had, and how it troubled me. I remember how what I had seen and heard\nwas turning, turning in my mind. Nick had come back to Antoinette. They\nwere together in that room, and Mrs. Temple was dying--dying. No, it\ncould not be so. Again, I was in the garden at Les Îles on a night that\nwas all perfume, and I saw the flowers all ghostly white under the moon.\nAnd then, suddenly, I was watching the green candle sputter, and out of\nthe stillness came a cry--the sereno calling the hour of the night. How\nmy head throbbed! It was keeping time to some rhythm, I knew not what.\nYes, it was the song my father used to sing:--\n\n “I’ve faught on land? I’ve faught at sea,\n At hame I’ve faught my aunty, O!”\n\nBut New Orleans was hot, burning hot, and this could not be cold I felt.\nAh, I had it, the water was cold going to Vincennes, so cold!\n\nA voice called me. No matter where I had gone, I think I would have come\nback at the sound of it. I listened intently, that I might lose no word\nof what it said. I knew the voice. Had it not called to me many times in\nmy life before? But now there was fear in it, and fear gave it a vibrant\nsweetness, fear gave it a quality that made it mine--mine.\n\n“You are shivering.”\n\nThat was all it said, and it called from across the sea. And the sea\nwas cold,--cold and green under the gray light. If she who called to me\nwould only come with the warmth of her love! The sea faded, the light\nfell, and I was in the eternal cold of space between the whirling\nworlds. If she could but find me! Was not that her hand in mine? Did I\nnot feel her near me, touching me? I wondered that I should hear myself\nas I answered her.\n\n“I am not ill,” I said. “Speak to me again.”\n\nShe was pressing my hand now, I saw her bending over me, I felt her hair\nas it brushed my face. She spoke again. There was a tremor in her voice,\nand to that alone I listened. The words were decisive, of command,\nand with them some sense as of a haven near came to me. Another voice\nanswered in a strange tongue, saying seemingly:--\n\n“Oui, Madame--malé couri--bon djé--malé couri!”\n\nI heard the doors close, and the sound of footsteps running and dying\nalong the banquette, and after that my shoulders were raised and\nsomething wrapped about them. Then stillness again, the stillness that\ncomes between waking and sleeping, between pain and calm. And at times\nwhen I felt her hand fall into mine or press against my brow, the pain\nseemed more endurable. After that I recall being lifted, being borne\nalong. I opened my eyes once and saw, above a tile-crowned wall, the\nmoon all yellow and distorted in the sky. Then a gate clicked, dungeon\nblackness, half-light again, ascent, oblivion.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. VISIONS, AND AN AWAKENING\n\n\nI have still sharp memories of the tortures of that illness, though it\nbefell so long ago. At times, when my mind was gone from me, I cried out\nI know not what of jargon, of sentiment, of the horrors I had beheld in\nmy life. I lived again the pleasant scenes, warped and burlesqued almost\nbeyond cognizance, and the tragedies were magnified a hundred fold. Thus\nit would be: on the low, white ceiling five cracks came together, and\nthat was a device. And the device would take on color, red-bronze like\nthe sumach in the autumn and streaks of vermilion, and two glowing coals\nthat were eyes, and above them eagles’ feathers, and the cracks became\nbramble bushes. I was behind the log, and at times I started and knew\nthat it was a hideous dream, and again Polly Ann was clutching me and\npraying me to hold back, and I broke from her and splashed over the\nslippery limestone bed of the creek to fight single-handed. Through all\nthe fearful struggle I heard her calling me piteously to come back to\nher. When the brute got me under water I could not hear her, but her\nvoice came back suddenly (as when a door opens) and it was like the wind\nsinging in the poplars. Was it Polly Ann’s voice?\n\nAgain, I sat with Nick under the trees on the lawn at Temple Bow, and\nthe world was dark with the coming storm. I knew and he knew that the\nstorm was brewing that I might be thrust out into it. And then in the\nblackness, when the air was filled with all the fair things of the earth\ntorn asunder, a beautiful woman came through the noise and the fury, and\nwe ran to her and clung to her skirts, thinking we had found safety. But\nshe thrust us forth into the blackness with a smile, as though she were\nflinging papers out of the window. She, too, grew out of the design in\nthe cracks of the ceiling, and a greater fear seized me at sight of her\nfeatures than when the red face came out of the brambles.\n\nMy constant torment was thirst. I was in the prairie, and it was\nscorched and brown to the horizon. I searched and prayed pitifully for\nwater,--for only a sip of the brown water with the specks in it that\nwas in the swamp. There were no swamps. I was on the bed in the cabin\nlooking at the shifts and hunting shirts on the pegs, and Polly Ann\nwould bring a gourdful of clear water from the spring as far as the\ndoor. Nay, once I got it to my lips, and it was gone. Sometimes a young\nman in a hunting shirt, square-shouldered, clear-eyed, his face tanned\nand his fair hair bleached by the sun, would bring the water. He was the\nhero of my boyhood, and part of him indeed was in me. And I would have\nfollowed him again to Vincennes despite the tortures of the damned. But\nwhen I spoke his name he grew stouter before me, and his eyes lost their\nlustre and his hair turned gray; and his hand shook as he held out the\ngourd and spilled its contents ere I could reach them.\n\nSometimes another brought the water, and at sight of her I would tremble\nand grow faint, and I had not the strength to reach for it. She would\nlook at me with eyes that laughed despite the resolution of the mouth.\nThen the eyes would grow pitiful at my helplessness, and she would\nmurmur my name. There was some reason which I never fathomed why she\ncould not give me the water, and her own suffering seemed greater than\nmine because of it. So great did it seem that I forgot my own and sought\nto comfort her. Then she would go away, very slowly, and I would hear\nher calling to me in the wind, from the stars to which I looked up from\nthe prairie. It was she, I thought, who ordered the world. Who, when\nwomen were lost and men cried out in distress, came to them calmly,\nministered to them deftly.\n\nOnce--perhaps a score of times, I cannot tell--was limned on the\nceiling, where the cracks were, her miniature, and I knew what was\ncoming and shuddered and cried aloud because I could not stop it. I\nsaw the narrow street of a strange city deep down between high\nhouses,--houses with gratings on the lowest windows, with studded,\nevil-looking doors, with upper stories that toppled over to shut out the\nlight of the sky, with slated roofs that slanted and twisted this way\nand that and dormers peeping from them. Down in the street, instead of\nthe King’s white soldiers, was a foul, unkempt rabble, creeping out\nof its damp places, jesting, cursing, singing. And in the midst of the\nrabble a lady sat in a cart high above it unmoved. She was the lady of\nthe miniature. A window in one of the jutting houses was flung open,\na little man leaned out excitedly, and I knew him too. He was Jean\nBaptiste Lenoir, and he cried out in a shrill voice:--\n\n“You must take off her ruff, citizens. You must take off her ruff!”\n\nThere came a blessed day when my thirst was gone, when I looked up at\nthe cracks in the ceiling and wondered why they did not change into\nhorrors. I watched them a long, long time, and it seemed incredible\nthat they should still remain cracks. Beyond that I would not go, into\nspeculation I dared not venture. They remained cracks, and I went to\nsleep thanking God. When I awoke a breeze came in cool, fitful gusts,\nand on it the scent of camellias. I thought of turning my head, and I\nremember wondering for a long time over the expediency of this move.\nWhat would happen if I did! Perhaps the visions would come back, perhaps\nmy head would come off. Finally I decided to risk it, and the first\nthing that I beheld was a palm-leaf fan, moving slowly. That fact gave\nme food for thought, and contented me for a while. Then I hit upon\nthe idea that there must be something behind the fan. I was distinctly\npleased by this astuteness, and I spent more time in speculation.\nWhatever it was, it had a tantalizing elusiveness, keeping the fan\nbetween it and me. This was not fair.\n\nI had an inspiration. If I feigned to be asleep, perhaps the thing\nbehind the fan would come out. I shut my eyes. The breeze continued\nsteadily. Surely no human being could fan as long as that without being\ntired! I opened my eyes twice, but the thing was inscrutable. Then\nI heard a sound that I knew to be a footstep upon boards. A voice\nwhispered:--\n\n“The delirium has left him.”\n\nAnother voice, a man’s voice, answered:--\n\n“Thank God! Let me fan him. You are tired.”\n\n“I am not tired,” answered the first voice.\n\n“I do not see how you have stood it,” said the man’s voice. “You will\nkill yourself, Madame la Vicomtesse. The danger is past now.”\n\n“I hope so, Mr. Temple,” said the first voice. “Please go away. You may\ncome back in half an hour.”\n\nI heard the footsteps retreating. Then I said: “I am not asleep.”\n\nThe fan stopped for a brief instant and then went on vibrating\ninexorably. I was entranced at the thought of what I had done. I had\nspoken, though indeed it seemed to have had no effect. Could it be\nthat I hadn’t spoken? I began to be frightened at this, when gradually\nsomething crept into my mind and drove the fear out. I did not grasp\nwhat this was at first, it was like the first staining of wine on the\neastern sky to one who sees a sunrise. And then the thought grew even\nas the light grows, tinged by prismatic colors, until at length a\nmemory struck into my soul like a shaft of light. I spoke her name,\nunblushingly, aloud.\n\n“Hélène!”\n\nThe fan stopped. There was a silence that seemed an eternity as the palm\nleaf trembled in her hand, there was an answer that strove tenderly to\ncommand.\n\n“Hush, you must not talk,” she said.\n\nNever, I believe, came such supreme happiness with obedience. I felt her\nhand upon my brow, and the fan moved again. I fell asleep once more from\nsheer weariness of joy. She was there, beside me. She had been there,\nbeside me, through it all, and it was her touch which had brought me\nback to life.\n\nI dreamed of her. When I awoke again her image was in my mind, and I\nlet it rest there in contemplation. But presently I thought of the fan,\nturned my head, and it was not there. A great fear seized me. I looked\nout of the open door where the morning sun threw the checkered shadows\nof the honeysuckle on the floor of the gallery, and over the railing to\nthe tree-tops in the court-yard. The place struck a chord in my memory.\nThen my eyes wandered back into the room. There was a polished dresser,\na crucifix and a prie-dieu in the corner, a fauteuil, and another chair\nat my bed. The floor was rubbed to an immaculate cleanliness, stained\nyellow, and on it lay clean woven mats. The room was empty!\n\nI cried out, a yellow and red turban shot across the window, and I\nbeheld in the door the spare countenance of the faithful Lindy.\n\n“Marse Dave,” she cried, “is you feelin’ well, honey?”\n\n“Where am I, Lindy?” I asked.\n\nLindy, like many of her race, knew well how to assume airs of\nimportance. Lindy had me down, and she knew it.\n\n“Marse Dave,” she said, “doan yo’ know better’n dat? Yo’ know yo’ ain’t\nter talk. Lawsy, I reckon I wouldn’t be wuth pizen if she was to hear I\nlet yo’ talk.”\n\nLindy implied that there was tyranny somewhere.\n\n“She?” I asked, “who’s she?”\n\n“Now yo’ hush, Marse Dave,” said Lindy, in a shrill whisper, “I ain’t\ner-gwine ter git mixed up in no disputation. Ef she was ter hear\nme er-disputin’ wid yo’, Marse Dave, I reckon I’d done git such er\ntongue-lashin’--” Lindy looked at me suspiciously. “Yo’-er allus was\npowe’rful cute, Marse Dave.”\n\nLindy set her lips with a mighty resolve to be silent. I heard some one\ncoming along the gallery, and then I saw Nick’s tall figure looming up\nbehind her.\n\n“Davy,” he cried.\n\nLindy braced herself up doggedly.\n\n“Yo’ ain’t er-gwine to git in thar nohow, Marse Nick,” she said.\n\n“Nonsense, Lindy,” he answered, “I’ve been in there as much as you\nhave.” And he took hold of her thin arm and pulled her back.\n\n“Marse Nick!” she cried, terror-stricken, “she’ll done fin’ out dat\nyou’ve been er-talkin’.”\n\n“Pish!” said Nick with a fine air, “who’s afraid of her?”\n\nLindy’s face took on an expression of intense amusement.\n\n“Yo’ is, for one, Marse Nick,” she answered, with the familiarity of an\nold servant. “I done seed yo’ skedaddle when she comed.”\n\n“Tut,” said Nick, grandly, “I run from no woman. Eh, Davy?” He pushed\npast the protesting Lindy into the room and took my hand.\n\n“Egad, you have been near the devil’s precipice, my son. A three-bottle\nman would have gone over.” In his eyes was all the strange affection\nhe had had for me ever since we had been boys at Temple Bow together.\n“Davy, I reckon life wouldn’t have been worth much if you’d gone.”\n\nI did not answer. I could only stare at him, mutely grateful for such an\naffection. In all his wild life he had been true to me, and he had clung\nto me stanchly in this, my greatest peril. Thankful that he was here,\nI searched his handsome person with my eyes. He was dressed, as usual,\nwith care and fashion, in linen breeches and a light gray coat and a\nfilmy ruffle at his neck. But I thought there had come a change into his\nface. The reckless quality seemed to have gone out of it, yet the spirit\nand daring remained, and with these all the sweetness that was once in\nhis smile. There were lines under his eyes that spoke of vigils.\n\n“You have been sitting up with me,” I said.\n\n“Of course,” he answered, patting my shoulder. “Of course I have. What\ndid you think I would be doing?”\n\n“What was the matter with me?” I asked.\n\n“Nothing much,” he said lightly, “a touch of the sun, and a great deal\nof overwork in behalf of your friends. Now keep still, or I will be\ngetting peppered.”\n\nI was silent for a while, turning over this answer in my mind. Then I\nsaid:--\n\n“I had yellow fever.”\n\nHe started.\n\n“It is no use to lie to you,” he replied; “you’re too shrewd.”\n\nI was silent again for a while.\n\n“Nick,” I said, “you had no right to stay here. You have--other\nresponsibilities now.”\n\nHe laughed. It was the old buoyant, boyish laugh of sheer happiness, and\nI felt the better for hearing it.\n\n“If you begin to preach, parson, I’ll go; I vow I’ll have no more\nsermonizing. Davy,” he cried, “isn’t she just the dearest, sweetest,\nmost beautiful person in the world?”\n\nI smiled.\n\n“Where is she?” I asked, temporizing. Nick was not a subtle person, and\nI was ready to follow him at great length in the praise of Antoinette.\n“I hope she is not here.”\n\n“We made her go to Les Îles,” said he.\n\n“And you risked your life and stayed here without her?” I said.\n\n“As for risking life, that kind of criticism doesn’t come well from\nyou. And as for Antoinette,” he added with a smile, “I expect to see\nsomething of her later on.”\n\n“Well,” I answered with a sigh of supreme content, “you have been a fool\nall your life, and I hope that she will make you sensible.”\n\n“You never could make me so,” said Nick, “and besides, I don’t think\nyou’ve been so damned sensible yourself.”\n\nWe were silent again for a space.\n\n“Davy,” he asked, “do you remember what I said when you had that\nminiature here?”\n\n“You said a great many things, I believe.”\n\n“I told you to consider carefully the masterful features of that lady,\nand to thank God you hadn’t married her. I vow I never thought she’d\nturn up. Upon my oath I never thought I should be such a blind slave\nas I have been for the last fortnight. Faith, Monsieur de St. Gré is a\nstrong man, but he was no more than a puppet in his own house when he\ncame back here for a day. That lady could govern a province,--no, a\nkingdom. But I warrant you there would be no climbing of balconies in\nher dominions. I have never been so generalled in my life.”\n\nI had no answer for these comments.\n\n“The deuce of it is the way she does it,” he continued, plainly bent on\nrelieving himself. “There’s no noise, no fuss; but you must obey, you\ndon’t know why. And yet you may flay me if I don’t love her.”\n\n“Love her!” I repeated.\n\n“She saved your life,” said Nick; “I don’t believe any other woman could\nhave done it. She hadn’t any thought of her own. She has been here, in\nthis room, almost constantly night and day, and she never let you go.\nThe little French doctor gave you up--not she. She held on. Cursed if I\nsee why she did it.”\n\n“Nor I,” I answered.\n\n“Well,” he said apologetically, “of course I would have done it, but\nyou weren’t anything to her. Yes, egad, you were something to be\nsaved,--that was all that was necessary. She had you brought back\nhere--we are in Monsieur de St. Gré’s house, by the way--in a litter,\nand she took command as though she had nursed yellow fever cases all her\nlife. No flurry. I said that you were in love with her once, Davy, when\nI saw you looking at the portrait. I take it back. Of course a man could\nbe very fond of her,” he said, “but a king ought to have married her. As\nfor that poor Vicomte she’s tied up to, I reckon I know the reason why\nhe didn’t come to America. An ordinary man would have no chance at all.\nGod bless her!” he cried, with a sudden burst of feeling, “I would\ndie for her myself. She got me out of a barrel of trouble with his\nExcellency. She cared for my mother, a lonely outcast, and braved death\nherself to go to her when she was dying of the fever. God bless her!”\n\nLindy was standing in the doorway.\n\n“Lan’ sakes, Marse Nick, yo’ gotter go,” she said.\n\nHe rose and pressed my fingers. “I’ll go,” he said, and left me. Lindy\nseated herself in the chair. She held in her hand a bowl of beef broth.\nFrom this she fed me in silence, and when she left she commanded me to\nsleep informing me that she would be on the gallery within call.\n\nBut I did not sleep at once. Nick’s words had brought back a fact which\nmy returning consciousness had hitherto ignored. The birds sang in the\ncourt-yard, and when the breeze stirred it was ever laden with a new\nscent. I had been snatched from the jaws of death, my life was before\nme, but the happiness which had thrilled me was gone, and in my weakness\nthe weight of the sadness which had come upon me was almost unbearable.\nIf I had had the strength, I would have risen then and there from my\nbed, I would have fled from the city at the first opportunity. As it\nwas, I lay in a torture of thought, living over again every part of my\nlife which she had touched. I remembered the first long, yearning look I\nhad given the miniature at Madame Bouvet’s. I had not loved her then.\nMy feeling rather had been a mysterious sympathy with and admiration for\nthis brilliant lady whose sphere was so far removed from mine. This was\nsufficiently strange. Again, in the years of my struggle for livelihood\nwhich followed, I dreamed of her; I pictured her often in the midst of\nthe darkness of the Revolution. Then I had the miniature again, which\nhad travelled to her, as it were, and come back to me. Even then it was\nnot love I felt, but an unnamed sentiment for one whom I clothed with\ngifts and attributes I admired: constancy, an ability to suffer and\nto hide, decision, wit, refuge for the weak, scorn for the false. So I\nnamed them at random and cherished them, knowing that these things were\nnot what other men longed for in women. Nay, there was another quality\nwhich I believed was there--which I knew was there--a supreme tenderness\nthat was hidden like a treasure too sacred to be seen.\n\nI did not seek to explain the mystery which had brought her across the\nsea into that little garden of Mrs. Temple’s and into my heart. There\nshe was now enthroned, deified; that she would always be there I\naccepted. That I would never say or do anything not in consonance with\nher standards I knew. That I would suffer much I was sure, but the lees\nof that suffering I should hoard because they came from her.\n\nWhat might have been I tried to put away. There was the moment, I\nthought, when our souls had met in the little parlor in the Rue Bourbon.\nI should never know. This I knew--that we had labored together to bring\nhappiness into other lives.\n\nThen came another thought to appall me. Unmindful of her own safety,\nshe had nursed me back to life through all the horrors of the fever. The\ndoctor had despaired, and I knew that by the very force that was in her\nshe had saved me. She was here now, in this house, and presently she\nwould be coming back to my bedside. Painfully I turned my face to the\nwall in a torment of humiliation--I had called her by her name. I would\nsee her again, but I knew not whence the strength for that ordeal was to\ncome.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. A MYSTERY\n\nI knew by the light that it was evening when I awoke. So prisoners mark\nthe passing of the days by a bar of sun light. And as I looked at the\ngreen trees in the courtyard, vaguely troubled by I knew not what, some\none came and stood in the doorway. It was Nick.\n\n“You don’t seem very cheerful,” said he; “a man ought to be who has been\nsnatched out of the fire.”\n\n“You seem to be rather too sure of my future,” I said, trying to smile.\n\n“That’s more like you,” said Nick. “Egad, you ought to be happy--we all\nought to be happy--she’s gone.”\n\n“She!” I cried. “Who’s gone?”\n\n“Madame la Vicomtesse,” he replied, rubbing his hands as he stood over\nme. “But she’s left instructions with me for Lindy as long as Monsieur\nde Carondelet’s Bando de Buen Gobierno. You are not to do this, and you\nare not to do that, you are to eat such and such things, you are to be\nmade to sleep at such and such times. She came in here about an hour ago\nand took a long look at you before she left.”\n\n“She was not ill?” I said faintly.\n\n“Faith, I don’t know why she was not,” he said. “She has done enough to\ntire out an army. But she seems well and fairly happy. She had her joke\nat my expense as she went through the court-yard, and she reminded me\nthat we were to send a report by André every day.”\n\nChagrin, depression, relief, bewilderment, all were struggling within\nme.\n\n“Where did she go?” I asked at last.\n\n“To Les Îles,” he said. “You are to be brought there as soon as you are\nstrong enough.”\n\n“Do you happen to know why she went?” I said.\n\n“Now how the deuce should I know?” he answered. “I’ve done everything\nwith blind servility since I came into this house. I never asked for any\nreason--it never would have done any good. I suppose she thought that\nyou were well on the road to recovery, and she knew that Lindy was an\nold hand. And then the doctor is to come in.”\n\n“Why didn’t you go?” I demanded, with a sudden remembrance that he was\nstaying away from happiness.\n\n“It was because I longed for another taste of liberty, Davy,” he\nlaughed. “You and I will have an old-fashioned time here together,--a\ndeal of talk, and perhaps a little piquet,--who knows?”\n\nMy strength came back, bit by bit, and listening to his happiness did\nmuch to ease the soreness of my heart--while the light lasted. It was\nin the night watches that my struggles came--though often some unwitting\nspeech of his would bring back the pain. He took delight in telling me,\nfor example, how for hours at a time I had been in a fearful delirium.\n\n“The Lord knows what foolishness you talked, Davy,” said he. “It would\nhave done me good to hear you had you been in your right mind.”\n\n“But you did hear me,” I said, full of apprehensions.\n\n“Some of it,” said he. “You were after Wilkinson once, in a burrow, I\nbelieve, and you swore dreadfully because he got out of the other end.\nI can’t remember all the things you said. Oh, yes, once you were talking\nto Auguste de St. Gré about money.”\n\n“Money?” I repeated in a sinking voice.\n\n“Oh, a lot of jargon. The Vicomtesse pushed me out of the room, and\nafter that I was never allowed to be there when you had those flights.\nCurse the mosquitoes!” He seized a fan and began to ply it vigorously.\n“I remember. You were giving Auguste a lecture. Then I had to go.”\n\nThese and other reminiscences gave me sufficient food for reflection,\nand many a shudder over the possibilities of my ravings. She had put him\nout! No wonder.\n\nAfter a while I was carried to the gallery, and there I would talk\nto the little doctor about the yellow fever which had swept the city.\nMonsieur Perrin was not much of a doctor, to be sure, and he had\na heartier dread of the American invasion than of the scourge. He\nworshipped the Vicomtesse, and was so devoid of professional pride as to\ngive her freely all credit for my recovery. He too, clothed her with the\nqualities of statesmanship.\n\n“Ha, Monsieur,” he said, “if that lady had been King of France, do you\nthink there would have been any States General, any red bonnets, any\nJacobins or Cordeliers? Parbleu, she would have swept the vicemongers\nand traitors out of the Palais Royal itself. There would have been a\nhouse-cleaning there. I, who speak to you, know it.”\n\nEvery day Nick wrote a bulletin to be sent to the Vicomtesse, and he\ntook a fiendish delight in the composition of these. He would come out\non the gallery with ink and a blank sheet of paper and try to enlist my\nhelp. He would insert the most ridiculous statements, as for instance,\n“Davy is worse to-day, having bribed Lindy to give him a pint of Madeira\nagainst my orders.” Or, “Davy feigns to be sinking rapidly because he\nwishes to have you back.” Indeed, I was always in a torture of doubt to\nknow what the rascal had sent.\n\nHis company was most agreeable when he was recounting the many\nadventures he had had during the five years after he had left New\nOrleans and been lost to me. These would fill a book, and a most\nreadable book it would be if written in his own speech. His love for the\nexcitement of the frontier had finally drawn him back to the Cumberland\ncountry near Nashville, and he had actually gone so far as to raise a\nhouse and till some of the land which he had won from Darnley. It\nwas perhaps characteristic of him that he had named the place\n“Rattle-and-Snap” in honor of the game which had put him in possession\nof it, and “Rattle-and-Snap” it remains to this day. He was going back\nthere with Antoinette, so he said, to build a brick mansion and to live\na respectable life the rest of his days.\n\nThere was one question which had been in my mind to ask him, concerning\nthe attitude of Monsieur de St. Gré. That gentleman, with Madame, had\nhurried back from Pointe Coupée at a message from the Vicomtesse, and\nhad gone first to Les Îles to see Antoinette. Then he had come, in spite\nof the fever, to his own house in New Orleans to see Nick himself. What\ntheir talk had been I never knew, for the subject was too painful to be\ndwelt upon, and the conversation had been marked by frankness on both\nsides. Monsieur de St. Gré was a just man, his love for his daughter was\nhis chief passion, and despite all that had happened he liked Nick. I\nbelieve he could not wholly blame the younger man, and he forgave him.\n\nMrs. Temple, poor lady, had died on that first night of my illness,\nand it was her punishment that she had not known her son or her son’s\nhappiness. Whatever sins she had committed in her wayward life were\natoned for, and by her death I firmly believe that she redeemed him. She\nlies now among the Temples in Charleston, and on the stone which marks\nher grave is cut no line that hints of the story of these pages.\n\nOne bright morning, when Nick and I were playing cards, we heard some\none mounting the stairs, and to my surprise and embarrassment I beheld\nMonsieur de St. Gré emerging on the gallery. He was in white linen and\nwore a broad hat, which he took from his head as he advanced. He had\naged somewhat, his hair was a little gray, but otherwise he was the\nfirm, dignified personage I had admired on this same gallery five years\nbefore.\n\n“Good morning, gentlemen,” he said in English; “ha, do not rise, sir”\n(to me). He patted Nick’s shoulder kindly, but not familiarly, as he\npassed him, and extended his hand.\n\n“Mr. Ritchie, it gives me more pleasure than I can express to see you so\nmuch recovered.”\n\n“I am again thrown on your hospitality, sir,” I said, flushing with\npleasure at this friendliness. For I admired and respected the man\ngreatly. “And I fear I have been a burden and trouble to you and your\nfamily.”\n\nHe took my hand and pressed it. Characteristically, he did not answer\nthis, and I remembered he was always careful not to say anything which\nmight smack of insincerity.\n\n“I had a glimpse of you some weeks ago,” he said, thus making light of\nthe risk he had run. “You are a different man now. You may thank your\nScotch blood and your strong constitution.”\n\n“His good habits have done him some good, after all,” put in my\nirrepressible cousin.\n\nMonsieur de St. Gré smiled.\n\n“Nick,” he said (he pronounced the name quaintly, like Antoinette), “his\ngood habits have turned out to be some advantage to you. Mr. Ritchie,\nyou have a faithful friend at least.” He patted Nick’s shoulder again.\n“And he has promised me to settle down.”\n\n“I have every inducement, sir,” said Nick.\n\nMonsieur de St. Gré became grave.\n\n“You have indeed, Monsieur,” he answered.\n\n“I have just come from Dr. Perrin’s, David,”--he added, “May I call you\nso? Well, then, I have just come from Dr. Perrin’s, and he says you\nmay be moved to Les Îles this very afternoon. Why, upon my word,” he\nexclaimed, staring at me, “you don’t look pleased. One would think you\nwere going to the calabozo.”\n\n“Ah,” said Nick, slyly, “I know. He has tasted freedom, Monsieur, and\nMadame la Vicomtesse will be in command again.”\n\nI flushed. Nick could be very exasperating.\n\n“You must not mind him, Monsieur,” I said.\n\n“I do not mind him,” answered Monsieur de St. Gré, laughing in spite of\nhimself. “He is a sad rogue. As for Hélène--”\n\n“I shall not know how to thank the Vicomtesse,” I said. “She has done me\nthe greatest service one person can do another.”\n\n“Hélène is a good woman,” answered Monsieur de St. Gré, simply. “She is\nmore than that, she is a wonderful woman. I remember telling you of her\nonce. I little thought then that she would ever come to us.”\n\nHe turned to me. “Dr. Perrin will be here this afternoon, David, and he\nwill have you dressed. Between five and six if all goes well, we shall\nstart for Les Îles. And in the meantime, gentlemen,” he added with a\nstateliness that was natural to him, “I have business which takes me\nto-day to my brother-in-law’s, Monsieur de Beauséjour’s.”\n\nNick leaned over the gallery and watched meditatively his prospective\nfather-in-law leaving the court-yard.\n\n“He got me out of a devilish bad scrape,” he said.\n\n“How was that?” I asked listlessly.\n\n“That fat little Baron, the Governor, was for deporting me for running\npast the sentry and giving him all the trouble I did. It seems that the\nVicomtesse promised to explain matters in a note which she wrote, and\nnever did explain. She was here with you, and a lot she cared about\nanything else. Lucky that Monsieur de St. Gré came back. Now his\nExcellency graciously allows me to stay here, if I behave myself, until\nI get married.”\n\nI do not know how I spent the rest of the day. It passed, somehow. If\nI had had the strength then, I believe I should have fled. I was to see\nher again, to feel her near me, to hear her voice. During the weeks that\nhad gone by I had schooled myself, in a sense, to the inevitable. I had\nnot let my mind dwell upon my visit to Les Îles, and now I was face to\nface with the struggle for which I felt I had not the strength. I had\nfought one battle,--I knew that a fiercer battle was to come.\n\nIn due time the doctor arrived, and while he prepared me for my\ndeparture, the little man sought, with misplaced kindness, to raise\nmy spirits. Was not Monsieur going to the country, to a paradise?\nMonsieur--so Dr. Perrin had noticed--had a turn for philosophy. Could\ntwo more able and brilliant conversationalists be found than Philippe\nde St. Gré and Madame la Vicomtesse? And there was the happiness of that\nstrange but lovable young man, Monsieur Temple, to contemplate. He was\nin luck, ce beau garçon, for he was getting an angel for his wife. Did\nMonsieur know that Mademoiselle Antoinette was an angel?\n\nAt last I was ready, arrayed in my best, on the gallery, when Monsieur\nde St. Gré came. André and another servant carried me down into the\ncourt, and there stood a painted sedan-chair with the St. Gré arms on\nthe panels.\n\n“My father imported it, David,” said Monsieur de St. Gré. “It has not\nbeen used for many years. You are to be carried in it to the levee, and\nthere I have a boat for you.”\n\nOverwhelmed by this kindness, I could not find words to thank him as I\ngot into the chair. My legs were too long for it, I remember. I had a\nquaint feeling of unreality as I sank back on the red satin cushions\nand was borne out of the gate between the lions. Monsieur de St. Gré and\nNick walked in front, the faithful Lindy followed, and people paused to\nstare at us as we passed. We crossed the Place d’Armes, the Royal Road,\ngained the willow-bordered promenade on the levee’s crown, and a wide\nbarge was waiting, manned by six negro oarsmen. They lifted me into its\nstern under the awning, the barge was cast off, the oars dipped, and we\nwere gliding silently past the line of keel boats on the swift current\nof the Mississippi. The spars of the shipping were inky black, and the\nsetting sun had struck a red band across the waters. For a while the\nthree of us sat gazing at the green shore, each wrapped in his own\nreflections,--Philippe de St. Gré thinking, perchance, of the wayward\nson he had lost; Nick of the woman who awaited him; and I of one whom\nfate had set beyond me. It was Monsieur de St. Gré who broke the silence\nat last.\n\n“You feel no ill effects from your moving, David?” he asked, with an\nanxious glance at me.\n\n“None, sir,” I said.\n\n“The country air will do you good,” he said kindly.\n\n“And Madame la Vicomtesse will put him on a diet,” added Nick, rousing\nhimself.\n\n“Hélène will take care of him,” answered Monsieur de St. Gré.\n\nHe fell to musing again. “Madame la Vicomtesse has seen more in seven\nyears than most of us see in a lifetime,” he said. “She has beheld the\nglory of France, and the dishonor and pollution of her country. Had the\nold order lasted her salon would have been famous, and she would have\nbeen a power in politics.”\n\n“I have thought that the Vicomtesse must have had a queer marriage,”\nNick remarked.\n\nMonsieur de St. Gré smiled.\n\n“Such marriages were the rule amongst our nobility,” he said. “It\nwas arranged while Hélène was still in the convent, though it was not\ncelebrated until three years after she had been in the world. There\nwas a romantic affair, I believe, with a young gentleman of the English\nembassy, though I do not know the details. He is said to be the only man\nshe ever cared for. He was a younger son of an impoverished earl.”\n\nI started, remembering what the Vicomtesse had said. But Monsieur de St.\nGré did not appear to see my perturbation.\n\n“Be that as it may, if Hélène suffered, she never gave a sign of it.\nThe marriage was celebrated with great pomp, and the world could only\nconjecture what she thought of the Vicomte. It was deemed on both\nsides a brilliant match. He had inherited vast estates, Ivry-le-Tour,\nMontméry, Les Saillantes, I know not what else. She was heiress to the\nChâteau de St. Gré with its wide lands, to the château and lands of\nthe Côte Rouge in Normandy, to the hotel St. Gré in Paris. Monsieur le\nVicomte was between forty and fifty at his marriage, and from what I\nhave heard of him he had many of the virtues and many of the faults of\nhis order. He was a bachelor, which does not mean that he had lacked\nconsolations. He was reserved with his equals, and distant with others.\nHe had served in the Guards, and did not lack courage. He dressed\nexquisitely, was inclined to the Polignac party, took his ease\neverywhere, had a knowledge of cards and courts, and little else. He\nwas cheated by his stewards, refused to believe that the Revolution was\nserious, and would undoubtedly have been guillotined had the Vicomtesse\nnot contrived to get him out of France in spite of himself. They went\nfirst to the Duke de Ligne, at Bel Oeil, and thence to Coblentz. He\naccepted a commission in the Austrian service, which is much to his\ncredit, and Hélène went with some friends to England. There my letter\nreached her, and rather than be beholden to strangers or accept my money\nthere, she came to us. That is her story in brief, Messieurs. As for\nMonsieur le Vicomte, he admired his wife, as well he might, respected\nher for the way she served the gallants, but he made no pretence of\nloving her. One affair--a girl in the village of Montméry--had lasted.\nHélène was destined for higher things than may be found in Louisiana,”\n said Monsieur de St. Gré, turning to Nick, “but now that you are to\ncarry away my treasure, Monsieur, I do not know what I should have done\nwithout her.”\n\n“And has there been any news of the Vicomte of late?”\n\nIt was Nick who asked the question, after a little. Monsieur de St. Gré\nlooked at him in surprise.\n\n“Eh, mon Dieu, have you not heard?” he said. “C’est vrai, you have\nbeen with David. Did not the Vicomtesse mention it? But why should she?\nMonsieur le Vicomte died in Vienna. He had lived too well.”\n\n“The Vicomte is dead?” I said.\n\nThey both looked at me. Indeed, I should not have recognized my own\nvoice. What my face betrayed, what my feelings were, I cannot say.\nMy heart beat no faster, there was no tumult in my brain, and yet--my\nbreath caught strangely. Something grew within me which is beyond the\nmeasure of speech, and so it was meant to be.\n\n“I did not know this myself until Hélène returned to Les Îles,” Monsieur\nde St. Gré was saying to me. “The letter came to her the day after you\nwere taken ill. It was from the Baron von Seckenbrück, at whose house\nthe Vicomte died. She took it very calmly, for Hélène is not a woman to\npretend. How much better, after all, if she had married her Englishman\nfor love! And she is much troubled now because, as she declares, she\nis dependent upon my bounty. That is my happiness, my consolation,” the\ngood man added simply, “and her father, the Marquis, was kind to me when\nI was a young provincial and a stranger. God rest his soul!”\n\nWe were drawing near to Les Îles. The rains had come during my illness,\nand in the level evening light the forest of the shore was the tender\ngreen of spring. At length we saw the white wooden steps in the levee at\nthe landing, and near them were three figures waiting. We glided nearer.\nOne was Madame de St. Gré, another was Antoinette,--these I saw indeed.\nThe other was Hélène, and it seemed to me that her eyes met mine across\nthe waters and drew them. Then we were at the landing. I heard Madame de\nSt. Gré’s voice, and Antoinette’s in welcome--I listened for another.\nI saw Nick running up the steps; in the impetuosity of his love he had\nseized Antoinette’s hand in his, and she was the color of a red rose.\nCreole decorum forbade further advances. André and another lifted\nme out, and they gathered around me,--these kind people and devoted\nfriends,--Antoinette calling me, with exquisite shyness, by name; Madame\nde St. Gré giving me a grave but gentle welcome, and asking anxiously\nhow I stood the journey. Another took my hand, held it for the briefest\nspace that has been marked out of time, and for that instant I looked\ninto her eyes. Life flowed back into me, and strength, and a joy not\nto be fathomed. I could have walked; but they bore me through the\nwell-remembered vista, and the white gallery at the end of it was like\nthe sight of home. The evening air was laden with the scent of the\nsweetest of all shrubs and flowers.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. “TO UNPATHED WATERS, UNDREAMED SHORES”\n\nMonsieur and Madame de St. Gré themselves came with me to my chamber off\nthe gallery, where everything was prepared for my arrival with the\nmost loving care,--Monsieur de St. Gré supplying many things from\nhis wardrobe which I lacked. And when I tried to thank them for their\nkindness he laid his hand upon my shoulder.\n\n“Tenez, mon ami,” he said, “you got your illness by doing things for\nother people. It is time other people did something for you.”\n\nLindy brought me the daintiest of suppers, and I was left to my\nmeditations. Nick looked in at the door, and hinted darkly that I had to\nthank a certain tyrant for my abandonment. I called to him, but he paid\nno heed, and I heard him chuckling as he retreated along the gallery.\nThe journey, the excitement into which I had been plunged by the news I\nhad heard, brought on a languor, and I was between sleeping and waking\nhalf the night. I slept to dream of her, of the Vicomte, her husband,\nwalking in his park or playing cards amidst a brilliant company in a\ngreat candle-lit room like the drawing-room at Temple Bow. Doubt grew,\nand sleep left me. She was free now, indeed, but was she any nearer\nto me? Hope grew again,--why had she left me in New Orleans? She had\nreceived a letter, and if she had cared she would not have remained. But\nthere was a detestable argument to fit that likewise, and in the light\nof this argument it was most natural that she should return to Les Îles.\nAnd who was I, David Ritchie, a lawyer of the little town of Louisville,\nto aspire to the love of such a creature? Was it likely that Hélène,\nVicomtesse d’Ivry-le-Tour, would think twice of me? The powers of\nthe world were making ready to crush the presumptuous France of the\nJacobins, and the France of King and Aristocracy would be restored.\nChâteaux and lands would be hers again, and she would go back again to\nthat brilliant life among the great to which she was born, for which\nnature had fitted her. Last of all was the thought of the Englishman\nwhom I resembled. She would go back to him.\n\nNick was the first in my room the next morning. He had risen early (so\nhe ingenuously informed me) because Antoinette had a habit of getting\nup with the birds, and as I drank my coffee he was emphatic in his\ndenunciations of the customs of the country.\n\n“It is a wonderful day, Davy,” he cried; “you must hurry and get out.\nMonsieur de St. Gré sends his compliments, and wishes to know if you\nwill pardon his absence this morning. He is going to escort Antoinette\nand me over to see some of my prospective cousins, the Bertrands.” He\nmade a face, and bent nearer to my ear. “I swear to you I have not\nhad one moment alone with her. We have been for a walk, but Madame la\nVicomtesse must needs intrude herself upon us. Egad, I told her plainly\nwhat I thought of her tyranny.”\n\n“And what did she say?” I asked, trying to smile.\n\n“She laughed, and said that I belonged to a young nation which had done\nmuch harm in the world to everybody but themselves. Faith, if I wasn’t\nin love with Antoinette, I believe I’d be in love with her.”\n\n“I have no doubt of it,” I answered.\n\n“The Vicomtesse is as handsome as a queen this morning,” he continued\npaying no heed to this remark. “She has on a linen dress that puzzles\nme. It was made to walk among the trees and flowers, it is as simple as\nyou please; and yet it has a distinction that makes you stare.”\n\n“You seem to have stared,” I answered. “Since when did you take such\ninterest in gowns?”\n\n“Bless you, it was Antoinette. I never should have known,” said he.\n“Antoinette had never before seen the gown, and she asked the Vicomtesse\nwhere she got the pattern. The Vicomtesse said that the gown had been\nmade by Léonard, a court dressmaker, and it was of the fashion the Queen\nhad set to wear in the gardens of the Trianon when simplicity became the\ncraze. Antoinette is to have it copied, so she says.”\n\nWhich proved that Antoinette was human, after all, and happy once more.\n\n“Hang it,” said Nick, “she paid more attention to that gown than to me.\nGood-by, Davy. Obey the--the Colonel.”\n\n“Is--is not the Vicomtesse going with you?” I asked.\n\n“No, I’m sorry for you,” he called back from the gallery.\n\nHe had need to be, for I fell into as great a fright as ever I had had\nin my life. Monsieur de St. Gré knocked at the door and startled me out\nof my wits. Hearing that I was awake, he had come in person to make his\nexcuses for leaving me that morning.\n\n“Bon Dieu!” he said, looking at me, “the country has done you good\nalready. Behold a marvel! Au revoir, David.”\n\nI heard the horses being brought around, and laughter and voices. How\neasily I distinguished hers! Then I heard the hoof-beats on the soft\ndirt of the drive. Then silence,--the silence of a summer morning which\nis all myriad sweet sounds. Then Lindy appeared, starched and turbaned.\n\n“Marse Dave, how you feel dis mawnin’? Yo’ ‘pears mighty peart, sholy.\nMarse Dave, yo’ chair is sot on de gallery. Is you ready? I’ll fotch dat\nyaller nigger, André.”\n\n“You needn’t fetch André,” I said; “I can walk.”\n\n“Lan sakes, Marse Dave, but you is bumptious.”\n\nI rose and walked out on the gallery with surprising steadiness. A great\ncushioned chair had been placed there, and beside it a table with books,\nand another chair. I sat down. Lindy looked at me sharply, but I did not\nheed her, and presently she retired. The day, still in its early golden\nglory, seemed big with prescience. Above, the saffron haze was lifted,\nand there was the blue sky. The breeze held its breath; the fragrance of\ngrass and fruit and flowers, of the shrub that vied with all, languished\non the air. Out of these things she came.\n\nI knew that she was coming, but I saw her first at the gallery’s end,\nthe roses she held red against the white linen of her gown. Then I felt\na great yearning and a great dread. I have seen many of her kind since,\nand none reflected so truly as she the life of the old régime. Her\ndress, her carriage, her air, all suggested it; and she might, as Nick\nsaid, have been walking in the gardens of the Trianon. Titles I cared\nnothing for. Hers alone seemed real, to put her far above me. Had all\nwho bore them been as worthy, titles would have meant much to mankind.\n\nShe was coming swiftly. I rose to my feet before her. I believe I should\nhave risen in death. And then she was standing beside me, looking up\ninto my face.\n\n“You must not do that,” she said, “or I will go away.”\n\nI sat down again. She went to the door and called, I following her with\nmy eyes. Lindy came with a bowl of water.\n\n“Put it on the table,” said the Vicomtesse.\n\nLindy put the bowl on the table, gave us a glance, and departed\nsilently. The Vicomtesse began to arrange the flowers in the bowl, and\nI watched her, fascinated by her movements. She did everything quickly,\ndeftly, but this matter took an unconscionable time. She did not so much\nas glance at me. She seemed to have forgotten my presence.\n\n“There,” she said at last, giving them a final touch. “You are less\ntalkative, if anything, than usual this morning, Mr. Ritchie. You have\nnot said good morning, you have not told me how you were--you have not\neven thanked me for the roses. One might almost believe that you are\nsorry to come to Les Îles.”\n\n“One might believe anything who didn’t know, Madame la Vicomtesse.”\n\nShe put her hand to the flowers again.\n\n“It seems a pity to pick them, even in a good cause,” she said.\n\nShe was so near me that I could have touched her. A weakness seized\nme, and speech was farther away than ever. She moved, she sat down and\nlooked at me, and the kind of mocking smile came into her eyes that I\nknew was the forerunner of raillery.\n\n“There is a statue in the gardens of Versailles which seems always about\nto speak, and then to think better of it. You remind me of that statue,\nMr. Ritchie. It is the statue of Wisdom.”\n\nWhat did she mean?\n\n“Wisdom knows the limitations of its own worth, Madame,” I replied.\n\n“It is the one particular in which I should have thought wisdom was\nlacking,” she said. “You have a tongue, if you will deign to use it. Or\nshall I read to you?” she added quickly, picking up a book. “I have read\nto the Queen, when Madame Campan was tired. Her Majesty, poor dear lady,\ndid me the honor to say she liked my English.”\n\n“You have done everything, Madame,” I said.\n\n“I have read to a Queen, to a King’s sister, but never yet--to a King,”\nshe said, opening the book and giving me the briefest of glances. “You\nare all kings in America are you not? What shall I read?”\n\n“I would rather have you talk to me.”\n\n“Very well, I will tell you how the Queen spoke English. No, I will not\ndo that,” she said, a swift expression of sadness passing over her\nface. “I will never mock her again. She was a good sovereign and a brave\nwoman, and I loved her.” She was silent a moment, and I thought there\nwas a great weariness in her voice when she spoke again. “I have every\nreason to thank God when I think of the terrors I escaped, of the\nfriends I have found. And yet I am an unhappy woman, Mr. Ritchie.”\n\n“You are unhappy when you are not doing things for others, Madame,” I\nsuggested.\n\n“I am a discontented woman,” she said; “I always have been. And I am\nunhappy when I think of all those who were dear to me and whom I loved.\nMany are dead, and many are scattered and homeless.”\n\n“I have often thought of your sorrows, Madame,” I said.\n\n“Which reminds me that I should not burden you with them, my good\nfriend, when you are recovering. Do you know that you have been very\nnear to death?”\n\n“I know, Madame,” I faltered. “I know that had it not been for you I\nshould not be alive to-day. I know that you risked your life to save my\nown.”\n\nShe did not answer at once, and when I looked at her she was gazing out\nover the flowers on the lawn.\n\n“My life did not matter,” she said. “Let us not talk of that.”\n\nI might have answered, but I dared not speak for fear of saying what\nwas in my heart. And while I trembled with the repression of it, she was\nchanged. She turned her face towards me and smiled a little.\n\n“If you had obeyed me you would not have been so ill,” she said.\n\n“Then I am glad that I did not obey you.”\n\n“Your cousin, the irrepressible Mr. Temple, says I am a tyrant. Come\nnow, do you think me a tyrant?”\n\n“He has also said other things of you.”\n\n“What other things?”\n\nI blushed at my own boldness.\n\n“He said that if he were not in love with Antoinette, he would be in\nlove with you.”\n\n“A very safe compliment,” said the Vicomtesse. “Indeed, it sounds too\ncautious for Mr. Temple. You must have tampered with it, Mr. Ritchie,”\nshe flashed. “Mr. Temple is a boy. He needs discipline. He will have too\neasy a time with Antoinette.”\n\n“He is not the sort of man you should marry,” I said, and sat amazed at\nit.\n\nShe looked at me strangely.\n\n“No, he is not,” she answered. “He is more or less the sort of man I\nhave been thrown with all my life. They toil not, neither do they spin.\nI know you will not misunderstand me, for I am very fond of him. Mr.\nTemple is honest, fearless, lovable, and of good instincts. One cannot\nsay as much for the rest of his type. They go through life fighting,\ngaming, horse-racing, riding to hounds,--I have often thought that it\nwas no wonder our privileges came to an end. So many of us were steeped\nin selfishness and vice, were a burden on the world. The early nobles,\nwith all their crimes, were men who carved their way. Of such were the\nlords of the Marches. We toyed with politics, with simplicity, we wasted\nthe land, we played cards as our coaches passed through famine-stricken\nvillages. The reckoning came. Our punishment was not given into the\nhands of the bourgeois, who would have dealt justly, but to the scum,\nthe canaille, the demons of the earth. Had our King, had our nobility,\nbeen men with the old fire, they would not have stood it. They were worn\nout with centuries of catering to themselves. Give me a man who will\nshape his life and live it with all his strength. I am tired of sham\nand pretence, of cynical wit, of mocking at the real things of life, of\npride, vain-glory, and hypocrisy. Give me a man whose existence means\nsomething.”\n\nWas she thinking of the Englishman of whom she had spoken? Delicacy\nforbade my asking the question. He had been a man, according to her own\ntestimony. Where was he now? Her voice had a ring of earnestness in it I\nhad never heard before, and this arraignment of her own life and of her\nold friends surprised me. Now she seemed lost in a revery, from which I\nforebore to arouse her.\n\n“I have often tried to picture your life,” I said at last.\n\n“You?” she answered, turning her head quickly. “Often?”\n\n“Ever since I first saw the miniature,” I said. “Monsieur de St. Gré\ntold me some things, and afterwards I read ‘Le Mariage de Figaro,’\nand some novels, and some memoirs of the old courts which I got in\nPhiladelphia last winter. I used to think of you as I rode over the\nmountains, as I sat reading in my room of an evening. I used to picture\nyou in the palaces amusing the Queen and making the Cardinals laugh. And\nthen I used to wonder--what became of you--and whether--” I hesitated,\noverwhelmed by a sudden confusion, for she was gazing at me fixedly with\na look I did not understand.\n\n“You used to think of that?” she said.\n\n“I never thought to see you,” I answered.\n\nLaughter came into her eyes, and I knew that I had not vexed her. But I\nhad spoken stupidly, and I reddened.\n\n“I had a quick tongue,” she said, as though to cover my confusion.\n“I have it yet. In those days misfortune had not curbed it. I had not\nlearned to be charitable. When I was a child I used to ride with my\nfather to the hunts at St. Gré, and I was too ready to pick out the\nweaknesses of his guests. If one of the company had a trick or a\nmannerism, I never failed to catch it. People used to ask me what I\nthought of such and such a person, and that was bad for me. I saw their\nfailings and pretensions, but I ignored my own. It was the same at\nAbbaye aux Bois, the convent where I was taught. When I was presented to\nher Majesty I saw why people hated her. They did not understand her. She\nwas a woman with a large heart, with charity. Some did not suspect this,\nothers forgot it because they beheld a brilliant personage with keen\nperceptions who would not submit to being bored. Her Majesty made many\nenemies at court of persons who believed she was making fun of them.\nThere was a dress-maker at the French court called Mademoiselle Bertin,\nwho became ridiculously pretentious because the Queen allowed the\nwoman to dress her hair in private. Bertin used to put on airs with the\nnobility when they came to order gowns, and she was very rude to me when\nI went for my court dress. There was a ball at Versailles the day I was\npresented, and my father told me that her Majesty wished to speak with\nme. I was very much frightened. The Queen was standing with her back to\nthe mirror, the Duchesse de Polignac and some other ladies beside her,\nwhen my father brought me up, and her Majesty was smiling.\n\n“‘What did you say to Bertin, Mademoiselle?’ she asked.\n\n“I was more frightened than ever, but the remembrance of the woman’s\nimpudence got the better of me.\n\n“‘I told her that in dressing your Majesty’s hair she had acquired all\nthe court accomplishments but one.’\n\n“‘I’ll warrant that Bertin was curious,’ said the Queen.\n\n“‘She was, your Majesty.’\n\n“‘What is the accomplishment she lacks?’ the Queen demanded; ‘I should\nlike to know it myself.’\n\n“‘It is discrimination, your Majesty. I told the woman there were some\npeople she could be rude to with impunity. I was not one of them.’\n\n“‘She’ll never be rude to you again, Mademoiselle,’ said the Queen.\n\n“‘I am sure of it, your Majesty,’ I said.\n\n“The Queen laughed, and bade the Duchesse de Polignac invite me to\nsupper that evening. My father was delighted,--I was more frightened\nthan ever. But the party was small, her Majesty was very gracious and\nspoke to me often, and I saw that above all things she liked to be\namused. Poor lady! It was a year after that terrible affair of the\nnecklace, and she wished to be distracted from thinking of the calumnies\nwhich were being heaped upon her. She used to send for me often during\nthe years that followed, and I might have had a place at court near\nher person. But my father was sensible enough to advise me not to\naccept,--if I could refuse without offending her Majesty. The Queen was\nnot offended; she was good enough to say that I was wise in my request.\nShe had, indeed, abolished most of the ridiculous etiquette of the\ncourt. She would not eat in public, she would not be followed around the\npalace by ladies in court gowns, she would not have her ladies in the\nroom when she was dressing. If she wished a mirror, she would not wait\nfor it to be passed through half a dozen hands and handed her by a\nPrincess of the Blood. Sometimes she used to summon me to amuse her and\nwalk with me by the water in the beautiful gardens of the Petit Trianon.\nI used to imitate the people she disliked. I disliked them, too. I\nhave seen her laugh until the tears came into her eyes when I talked of\nMonsieur Necker. As the dark days drew nearer I loved more and more to\nbe in the seclusion of the country at Montméry, at the St. Gré of my\ngirlhood. I can see St. Gré now,” said the Vicomtesse, “the thatched\nhouses of the little village on either side of the high-road, the\nhonest, red-faced peasants courtesying in their doorways at our berline,\nthe brick wall of the park, the iron gates beside the lodge, the long\navenue of poplars, the deer feeding in the beechwood, the bridge over\nthe shining stream and the long, weather-beaten château beyond it. Paris\nand the muttering of the storm were far away. The mornings on the sunny\nterrace looking across the valley to the blue hills, the walks in the\nvillage, grew very dear to me. We do not know the value of things, Mr.\nRitchie, until we are about to lose them.”\n\n“You did not go back to court?” I asked.\n\nShe sighed.\n\n“Yes, I went back. I thought it my duty. I was at Versailles that\nterrible summer when the States General met, when the National Assembly\ngrew out of it, when the Bastille was stormed, when the King was\nthrowing away his prerogatives like confetti. Never did the gardens of\nthe Trianon seem more beautiful, or more sad. Sometimes the Queen would\nlaugh even then when I mimicked Bailly, Des Moulins, Mirabeau. I\nwas with her Majesty in the gardens on that dark, rainy day when the\nfishwomen came to Versailles. The memory of that night will haunt me as\nlong as I live. The wind howled, the rain lashed with fury against\nthe windows, the mob tore through the streets of the town, sacked the\nwine-shops, built great fires at the corners. Before the day dawned\nagain the furies had broken into the palace and murdered what was left\nof the Guard. You have heard how they carried off the King and Queen to\nParis--how they bore the heads of the soldiers on their pikes. I saw it\nfrom a window, and I shall never forget it.”\n\nHer voice faltered, and there were tears on her lashes. Some quality in\nher narration brought before me so vividly the scenes of which she spoke\nthat I started when she had finished. There was much more I would have\nknown, but I could not press her to speak longer on a subject that gave\nher pain. At that moment she seemed more distant to me than ever before.\nShe rose, went into the house, and left me thinking of the presumptions\nof the hopes I had dared to entertain, left me picturing sadly the\nexistence of which she had spoken. Why had she told me of it? Perchance\nshe had thought to do me a kindness!\n\nShe came back to me--I had not thought she would. She sat down with her\nembroidery in her lap, and for some moments busied herself with it in\nsilence. Then she said, without looking up:--\n\n“I do not know why I have tired you with this, why I have saddened\nmyself. It is past and gone.”\n\n“I was not tired, Madame. It is very difficult to live in the present\nwhen the past has been so brilliant,” I answered.\n\n“So brilliant!” She sighed. “So thoughtless,--I think that is the\nsharpest regret.” I watched her fingers as they stitched, wondering how\nthey could work so rapidly. At last she said in a low voice, “Antoinette\nand Mr. Temple have told me something of your life, Mr. Ritchie.”\n\nI laughed.\n\n“It has been very humble,” I replied.\n\n“What I heard was--interesting to me,” she said, turning over her frame.\n“Will you not tell me something of it?”\n\n“Gladly, Madame, if that is the case,” I answered.\n\n“Well, then,” she said, “why don’t you?”\n\n“I do not know which part you would like, Madame. Shall I tell you about\nColonel Clark? I do not know when to begin--”\n\nShe dropped her sewing in her lap and looked up at me quickly.\n\n“I told you that you were a strange man,” she said. “I almost lose\npatience with you. No, don’t tell me about Colonel Clark--at least\nnot until you come to him. Begin at the beginning, at the cabin in the\nmountains.”\n\n“You want the whole of it!” I exclaimed.\n\nShe picked up her embroidery again and bent over it with a smile.\n\n“Yes, I want the whole of it.”\n\nSo I began at the cabin in the mountains. I cannot say that I ever\nforgot she was listening, but I lost myself in the narrative. It\npresented to me, for the first time, many aspects that I had not thought\nof. For instance, that I should be here now in Louisiana telling it to\none who had been the companion and friend of the Queen of France. Once\nin a while the Vicomtesse would look up at me swiftly, when I paused,\nand then go on with her work again. I told her of Temple Bow, and how\nI had run away; of Polly Ann and Tom, of the Wilderness Trail and how I\nshot Cutcheon, of the fight at Crab Orchard, of the life in Kentucky, of\nClark and his campaign. Of my doings since; how I had found Nick and\nhow he had come to New Orleans with me; of my life as a lawyer in\nLouisville, of the conventions I had been to. The morning wore on to\nmidday, and I told her more than I believed it possible to tell any one.\nWhen at last I had finished a fear grew upon me that I had told her too\nmuch. Her fingers still stitched, her head was bent and I could not see\nher face,--only the knot of her hair coiled with an art that struck me\nsuddenly. Then she spoke, and her voice was very low.\n\n“I love Polly Ann,” she said; “I should like to know her.”\n\n“I wish that you could know her,” I answered, quickening.\n\nShe raised her head, and looked at me with an expression that was not a\nsmile. I could not say what it was, or what it meant.\n\n“I do not think you are stupid,” she said, in the same tone, “but I do\nnot believe you know how remarkable your life has been. I can scarcely\nrealize that you have seen all this, have done all this, have felt all\nthis. You are a lawyer, a man of affairs, and yet you could guide me\nover the hidden paths of half a continent. You know the mountain ranges,\nthe passes, the rivers, the fords, the forest trails, the towns and the\nmen who made them!” She picked up her sewing and bent over it once more.\n“And yet you did not think that this would interest me.”\n\nPerchance it was a subtle summons in her voice I heard that bade me open\nthe flood-gates of my heart,--I know not. I know only that no power on\nearth could have held me silent then.\n\n“Hélène!” I said, and stopped. My heart beat so wildly that I could\nhear it. “I do not know why I should dare to think of you, to look up\nto you--Hélène, I love you, I shall love you till I die. I love you with\nall the strength that is in me, with all my soul. You know it, and if\nyou did not I could hide it no more. As long as I live there will never\nbe another woman in the world for me. I love you. You will forgive me\nbecause of the torture I have suffered, because of the pain I shall\nsuffer when I think of you in the years to come.”\n\nHer sewing dropped to her lap--to the floor. She looked at me, and\nthe light which I saw in her eyes flooded my soul with a joy beyond my\nbelief. I trembled with a wonder that benumbed me. I would have got to\nmy feet had she not come to me swiftly, that I might not rise. She\nstood above me, I lifted up my arms; she bent to me with a movement that\nconferred a priceless thing.\n\n“David,” she said, “could you not tell that I loved you, that you were\nhe who has been in my mind for so many years, and in my heart since I\nsaw you?”\n\n“I could not tell,” I said. “I dared not think it. I--I thought there\nwas another.”\n\nShe was seated on the arm of my chair. She drew back her head with a\nsmile trembling on her lips, with a lustre burning in her eyes like a\nvigil--a vigil for me.\n\n“He reminded me of you,” she answered.\n\nI was lost in sheer, bewildering happiness. And she who created it, who\nherself was that happiness, roused me from it.\n\n“What are you thinking?” she asked.\n\n“I was thinking that a star has fallen,--that I may have a jewel beyond\nother men,” I said.\n\n“And a star has risen for me,” she said, “that I may have a guide beyond\nother women.”\n\n“Then it is you who have raised it, Hélène.” I was silent a moment,\ntrying again to bring the matter within my grasp. “Do you mean that you\nlove me, that you will marry me, that you will come back to Kentucky\nwith me and will be content,--you, who have been the companion of a\nQueen?”\n\nThere came an archness into her look that inflamed me the more.\n\n“I, who have been the companion of a Queen, love you, will marry you,\nwill go back to Kentucky with you and be content,” she repeated. “And\nyet not I, David, but another woman--a happy woman. You shall be my\nrefuge, my strength, my guide. You will lead me over the mountains and\nthrough the wilderness by the paths you know. You will bring me to Polly\nAnn that I may thank her for the gift of you,--above all other gifts in\nthe world.”\n\nI was silent again.\n\n“Hélène,” I said at last, “will you give me the miniature?”\n\n“On one condition,” she replied.\n\n“Yes,” I said, “yes. And again yes. What is it?”\n\n“That you will obey me--sometimes.”\n\n“It is a privilege I long for,” I answered.\n\n“You did not begin with promise,” she said.\n\nI released her hand, and she drew the ivory from her gown and gave it\nme. I kissed it.\n\n“I will go to Monsieur Isadore’s and get the frame,” I said.\n\n“When I give you permission,” said Hélène, gently.\n\nI have written this story for her eyes.\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. AN EPISODE IN THE LIFE OF A MAN\n\n\nOut of the blood and ashes of France a Man had arisen who moved real\nkings and queens on his chess-board--which was a large part of the\nworld. The Man was Napoleon Buonaparte, at present, for lack of a better\nname, First Consul of the French Republic. The Man’s eye, sweeping the\nworld for a new plaything, had rested upon one which had excited the\nfancy of lesser adventurers, of one John Law, for instance. It was a\nlarge, unwieldy plaything indeed, and remote. It was nothing less than\nthat vast and mysterious country which lay beyond the monster yellow\nRiver of the Wilderness, the country bordered on the south by the Gulf\nswamps, on the north by no man knew what forests,--as dark as those the\nRomans found in Gaul,--on the west by a line which other generations\nmight be left to settle.\n\nThis land was Louisiana.\n\nA future king of France, while an émigré, had been to Louisiana. This\nis merely an interesting fact worth noting. It was not interesting to\nNapoleon.\n\nNapoleon, by dint of certain screws which he tightened on his Catholic\nMajesty, King Charles of Spain, in the Treaty of San Ildefonso on\nthe 1st of October, 1800, got his plaything. Louisiana was French\nagain,--whatever French was in those days. The treaty was a profound\nsecret. But secrets leak out, even the profoundest; and this was wafted\nacross the English Channel to the ears of Mr. Rufus King, American\nMinister at London, who wrote of it to one Thomas Jefferson, President\nof the United States. Mr. Jefferson was interested, not to say alarmed.\n\nMr. Robert Livingston was about to depart on his mission from the little\nRepublic of America to the great Republic of France. Mr. Livingston was\ntold not to make himself disagreeable, but to protest. If Spain was to\ngive up the plaything, the Youngest Child among the Nations ought to\nhave it. It lay at her doors, it was necessary for her growth.\n\nMr. Livingston arrived in France to find that Louisiana was a mere\npawn on the chess-board, the Republic he represented little more. He\nprotested, and the great Talleyrand shrugged his shoulders. What was\nMonsieur talking about? A treaty. What treaty? A treaty with Spain\nceding back Louisiana to France after forty years. Who said there was\nsuch a treaty? Did Monsieur take snuff? Would Monsieur call again when\nthe Minister was less busy?\n\nMonsieur did call again, taking care not to make himself disagreeable.\nHe was offered snuff. He called again, pleasantly. He was offered snuff.\nHe called again. The great Talleyrand laughed. He was always so happy to\nsee Monsieur when he (Talleyrand) was not busy. He would give Monsieur\na certificate of importunity. He had quite forgotten what Monsieur was\ntalking about on former occasions. Oh, yes, a treaty. Well, suppose\nthere was such a treaty, what then?\n\nWhat then? Mr. Livingston, the agreeable but importunate, went home and\nwrote a memorial, and was presently assured that the inaccessible Man\nwho was called First Consul had read it with interest--great interest.\nMr. Livingston did not cease to indulge in his enjoyable visits to\nTalleyrand--not he. But in the intervals he sat down to think.\n\nWhat did the inaccessible Man himself have in his mind?\n\nThe Man had been considering the Anglo-Saxon race, and in particular\nthat portion of it which inhabited the Western Hemisphere. He perceived\nthat they were a quarrelsome people, which possessed the lust for land\nand conquest like the rest of their blood. He saw with astonishment\nsomething that had happened, something that they had done. Unperceived\nby the world, in five and twenty years they had swept across a thousand\nmiles of mountain and forest wilderness in ever increasing thousands,\nhad beaten the fiercest of savage tribes before them, stolidly unmindful\nof their dead. They had come at length to the great yellow River, and\nfinding it closed had cried aloud in their anger. What was beyond it to\nstop them? Spain, with a handful of subjects inherited from the France\nof Louis the Fifteenth.\n\nCould Spain stop them? No. But he, the Man, would stop them. He would\nraise up in Louisiana as a monument to himself a daughter of France to\ncurb their ambition. America should not be all Anglo-Saxon.\n\nAlready the Americans had compelled Spain to open the River. How long\nbefore they would overrun Louisiana itself, until a Frenchman or a\nSpaniard could scarce be found in the land?\n\nSadly, in accordance with the treaty which Monsieur Talleyrand had known\nnothing about, his Catholic Majesty instructed his Intendant at New\nOrleans to make ready to deliver Louisiana to the French Commission.\nThat was in July, 1802. This was not exactly an order to close the River\nagain--in fact, his Majesty said nothing about closing the River. Mark\nthe reasoning of the Spanish mind. The Intendant closed the River as his\nplain duty. And Kentucky and Tennessee, wayward, belligerent infants who\nhad outgrown their swaddling clothes, were heard from again. The Nation\nhad learned to listen to them. The Nation was very angry. Mr. Hamilton\nand the Federalists and many others would have gone to war and seized\nthe Floridas.\n\nMr. Jefferson said, “Wait and see what his Catholic Majesty has to\nsay.” Mr. Jefferson was a man of great wisdom, albeit he had mistaken\nJacobinism for something else when he was younger. And he knew that\nNapoleon could not play chess in the wind. The wind was rising.\n\nMr. Livingston was a patriot, able, importunate, but getting on in years\nand a little hard of hearing. Importunity without an Army and a Navy\nbehind it is not effective--especially when there is no wind. But\nMr. Jefferson heard the wind rising, and he sent Mr. Monroe to Mr.\nLivingston’s aid. Mr. Monroe was young, witty, lively, popular with\npeople he met. He, too, heard the wind rising, and so now did Mr.\nLivingston.\n\nThe ships containing the advance guard of the colonists destined for\nthe new Louisiana lay in the roads at Dunkirk, their anchors ready\nto weigh,--three thousand men, three thousand horses, for the Man did\nthings on a large scale. The anchors were not weighed.\n\nHis Catholic Majesty sent word from Spain to Mr. Jefferson that he was\nsorry his Intendant had been so foolish. The River was opened again.\n\nThe Treaty of Amiens was a poor wind-shield. It blew down, and the\nchessmen began to totter. One George of England, noted for his frugal\ntable and his quarrelsome disposition, who had previously fought with\nFrance, began to call the Man names. The Man called George names, and\nsat down to think quickly. George could not be said to be on the best of\nterms with his American relations, but the Anglo-Saxon is unsentimental,\nphlegmatic, setting money and trade and lands above ideals. George meant\nto go to war again. Napoleon also meant to go to war again. But\nGeorge meant to go to war again right away, which was inconvenient and\ninconsiderate, for Napoleon had not finished his game of chess. The\nobvious outcome of the situation was that George with his Navy would\nget Louisiana, or else help his relations to get it. In either case\nLouisiana would become Anglo-Saxon.\n\nThis was the wind which Mr. Jefferson had heard.\n\nThe Man, being a genius who let go gracefully when he had to, decided\nbetween two bad bargains. He would sell Louisiana to the Americans as\na favor; they would be very, very grateful, and they would go on hating\nGeorge. Moreover, he would have all the more money with which to fight\nGeorge.\n\nThe inaccessible Man suddenly became accessible. Nay, he became\ngracious, smiling, full of loving-kindness, charitable. Certain\ndickerings followed by a bargain passed between the American Minister\nand Monsieur Barbé-Marbois. Then Mr. Livingston and Mr. Monroe dined\nwith the hitherto inaccessible. And the Man, after the manner of\nContinental Personages, asked questions. Frederick the Great has started\nthis fashion, and many have imitated it.\n\nLouisiana became American at last. Whether by destiny or chance, whether\nby the wisdom of Jefferson or the necessity of Napoleon, who can say? It\nseems to me, David Ritchie, writing many years after the closing words\nof the last chapter were penned, that it was ours inevitably. For I have\nseen and known and loved the people with all their crudities and faults,\nwhose inheritance it was by right of toil and suffering and blood.\n\nAnd I, David Ritchie, saw the flags of three nations waving over it in\nthe space of two days. And it came to pass in this wise.\n\nRumors of these things which I have told above had filled Kentucky from\ntime to time, and in November of 1803 there came across the mountains\nthe news that the Senate of the United States had ratified the treaty\nbetween our ministers and Napoleon.\n\nI will not mention here what my life had become, what my fortune, save\nto say that both had been far beyond my expectations. In worldly goods\nand honors, in the respect and esteem of my fellow-men, I had been happy\nindeed. But I had been blessed above other men by one whose power it was\nto lift me above the mean and sordid things of this world.\n\nMany times in the pursuit of my affairs I journeyed over that country\nwhich I had known when it belonged to the Indian and the deer and the\nelk and the wolf and the buffalo. Often did she ride by my side,\nmaking light of the hardships which, indeed, were no hardships to her,\nwondering at the settlements which had sprung up like magic in\nthe wilderness, which were the heralds of the greatness of the\nRepublic,--her country now.\n\nSo, in the bright and boisterous March weather of the year 1804, we\nfound ourselves riding together along the way made memorable by the\nfootsteps of Clark and his backwoodsmen. For I had an errand in St.\nLouis with Colonel Chouteau. A subtle change had come upon Kaskaskia\nwith the new blood which was flowing into it: we passed Cahokia, full\nof memories to the drummer boy whom she loved. There was the church, the\ngarrison, the stream, and the little house where my Colonel and I had\nlived together. She must see them all, she must hear the story from my\nlips again; and the telling of it to her gave it a new fire and a new\nlife.\n\nAt evening, when the March wind had torn the cotton clouds to shreds,\nwe stood on the Mississippi’s bank, gazing at the western shore, at\nLouisiana. The low, forest-clad hills made a black band against the sky,\nand above the band hung the sun, a red ball. He was setting, and man\nmight look upon his face without fear. The sight of the waters of that\nriver stirred me to think of many things. What had God in store for the\nvast land out of which the waters flowed? Had He, indeed, saved it for a\nPeople, a People to be drawn from all nations, from all classes? Was\nthe principle of the Republic to prevail and spread and change the\ncomplexion of the world? Or were the lusts of greed and power to\nincrease until in the end they had swallowed the leaven? Who could say?\nWhat man of those who, soberly, had put his hand to the Paper which\ndeclared the opportunities of generations to come, could measure the\nForce which he had helped to set in motion.\n\nWe crossed the river to the village where I had been so kindly received\nmany years ago--to St. Louis. The place was little changed. The wind was\nstilled, the blue wood smoke curled lazily from the wide stone chimneys\nof the houses nestling against the hill. The afterglow was fading into\nnight; lights twinkled in the windows. Followed by our servants we\nclimbed the bank, Hélène and I, and walked the quiet streets bordered\nby palings. The evening was chill. We passed a bright cabaret from which\ncame the sound of many voices; in the blacksmith’s shop another group\nwas gathered, and we saw faces eager in the red light. They were talking\nof the Cession.\n\nWe passed that place where Nick had stopped Suzanne in the cart, and\nlaughed at the remembrance. We came to Monsieur Gratiot’s, for he had\nbidden us to stay with him. And with Madame he gave us a welcome to warm\nour hearts after our journey.\n\n“David,” he said, “I have seen many strange things happen in my life,\nbut the strangest of all is that Clark’s drummer boy should have married\na Vicomtesse of the old régime.”\n\nAnd she was ever Madame la Vicomtesse to our good friends in St. Louis,\nfor she was a woman to whom a title came as by nature’s right.\n\n“And you are about to behold another strange thing, David,” Monsieur\nGratiot continued. “To-day you are on French territory.”\n\n“French territory!” I exclaimed.\n\n“To-day Upper Louisiana is French,” he answered. “To-morrow it will be\nAmerican forever. This morning Captain Stoddard of the United States\nArmy, empowered to act as a Commissioner of the French Republic, arrived\nwith Captain Lewis and a guard of American troops. Today, at noon, the\nflag of Spain was lowered from the staff at the headquarters. To-night\na guard of honor watches with the French Tricolor, and we are French for\nthe last time. To-morrow we shall be Americans.”\n\nI saw that simple ceremony. The little company of soldiers was drawn up\nbefore the low stone headquarters, the villagers with heads uncovered\ngathered round about. I saw the Stars and Stripes rising, the Tricolor\nsetting. They met midway on the staff, hung together for a space, and\na salute to the two nations echoed among the hills across the waters of\nthe great River that rolled impassive by.\n\n\n\nAFTERWORD\n\nThis book has been named “The Crossing” because I have tried to express\nin it the beginnings of that great movement across the mountains which\nswept resistless over the Continent until at last it saw the Pacific\nitself. The Crossing was the first instinctive reaching out of an infant\nnation which was one day to become a giant. No annals in the world’s\nhistory are more wonderful than the story of the conquest of Kentucky\nand Tennessee by the pioneers.\n\nThis name, “The Crossing,” is likewise typical in another sense. The\npolitical faith of our forefathers, of which the Constitution is the\ncreed, was made to fit a more or less homogeneous body of people who\nproved that they knew the meaning of the word “Liberty.” By Liberty,\nour forefathers meant the Duty as well as the Right of man to govern\nhimself. The Constitution amply attests the greatness of its authors,\nbut it was a compromise. It was an attempt to satisfy thirteen\ncolonies, each of which clung tenaciously to its identity. It suited the\neighteenth-century conditions of a little English-speaking confederacy\nalong the seaboard, far removed from the world’s strife and jealousy. It\nscarcely contemplated that the harassed millions of Europe would flock\nto its fold, and it did not foresee that, in less than a hundred years,\nits own citizens would sweep across the three thousand miles of forest\nand plain and mountain to the Western Ocean, absorb French and Spanish\nLouisiana, Spanish Texas, Mexico, and California, fill this land\nwith broad farmsteads and populous cities, cover it with a network of\nrailroads.\n\nWould the Constitution, made to meet the needs of the little confederacy\nof the seaboard, stretch over a Continent and an Empire?\n\nWe are fighting out that question to-day. But The Crossing was in Daniel\nBoone’s time, in George Rogers Clark’s. Would the Constitution stand the\nstrain? And will it stand the strain now that the once remote haven of\nthe oppressed has become a world-power?\n\nIt was a difficult task in a novel to gather the elements necessary to\npicture this movement: the territory was vast, the types bewildering.\nThe lonely mountain cabin; the seigniorial life of the tide-water; the\nfoothills and mountains which the Scotch-Irish have marked for their own\nto this day; the Wilderness Trail; the wonderland of Kentucky, and the\ncruel fighting in the border forts there against the most relentless of\nfoes; George Rogers Clark and his momentous campaign which gave to the\nRepublic Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois; the transition period--the\ncoming of the settler after the pioneer; Louisiana, St. Louis, and New\nOrleans,--to cover this ground, to picture the passions and politics\nof the time, to bring the counter influence of the French Revolution\nas near as possible to reality, has been a three years’ task. The\nautobiography of David Ritchie is as near as I can get to its solution,\nand I have a great sense of its incompleteness.\n\nI had hoped when I planned the series to bring down this novel through\nthe stirring period which ended, by a chance, when a steamboat brought\nsupplies to Jackson’s army in New Orleans--the beginning of the era of\nsteam commerce on our Western waters. This work will have to be reserved\nfor a future time.\n\nI have tried to give a true history of Clark’s campaign as seen by an\neyewitness, trammelled as little as possible by romance. Elsewhere, as\nI look back through these pages, I feel as though the soil had only been\nscraped. What principality in the world has the story to rival that of\nJohn Sevier and the State of Franklin? I have tried to tell the truth as\nI went along. General Jackson was a boy at the Waxhaws and dug his toes\nin the red mud. He was a man at Jonesboro, and tradition says that he\nfought with a fence-rail. Sevier was captured as narrated. Monsieur\nGratiot, Monsieur Vigo, and Father Gibault lost the money which they\ngave to Clark and their country. Monsieur Vigo actually travelled in\nthe state which Davy describes when he went down the river with him.\nMonsieur Gratiot and Colonel Auguste Chouteau and Madame Chouteau are\nnames so well known in St. Louis that it is superfluous to say that such\npersons existed and were the foremost citizens of the community.\n\nAmong the many to whom my apologies and thanks are due is Mr. Pierre\nChouteau of St. Louis, whose unremitting labors have preserved and\nperpetuated the history and traditions of the country of his ancestors.\nI would that I had been better able to picture the character, the\ncourage, the ability, and patriotism of the French who settled\nLouisiana. The Republic owes them much, and their descendants are to-day\namong the stanchest preservers of her ideals.\n\nWINSTON CHURCHILL. \nBoston, April 18, 1904\n\n\n\nTranscriber Notes\n\nWelcome to the Project Gutenberg edition of The Crossing by Winston\nChurchill.

On a few\noccasions changes were made to correct obvious errors.\n\nDifferences between the text and e-book are explained here. A few items\nthat may be errors are listed below, but we did not correct an error\nunless it was an obvious one. Sometimes, a word had been hyphenated in\nthe book to split across two lines for even spacing, thus forcing the\ntranscriber to make a choice. Some of those decisions are listed below.\n\nPage 54: Changed a double quote nested inside of a double quote to use\nsingle quotes. “Behold, I ... affliction.” became ‘Behold, I ...\naffliction.’\nPage 82: Journeycakes is spelled without a hyphen here, but the\njourney-cakes of Page 94 and Page 95 had a hyphen. There were four\noccurrences of “journey-cake” and “journey-cakes” and no other\noccurrences of the word spelled without a hyphen. The inconsistency was\nretained.\nPage 147: The repeating “at all at all” looks like a typo, but Churchill\nalso used “at all, at all” on Page 222. No changes were made.\nPage 150: grog-shop was hyphenated between two lines, so could be\ntranscribed as “grog-shop” or “grogshop”. With no other examples in the\nnovel, we went with the latter usage— no hyphen.\nPage 152: The word “three-score,” split across two lines with a hyphen,\ncould be transcribed as “threescore” or “three-score.” Two lines after\nthat word, a sentence began “Threescore years!” The word was hyphenated\nfor spacing and not transcribed with a hyphen.\nPage 310: Add quotation-mark after Mr. Temple: \"Good-by, Mr. Temple,\"\nshe said…\nPage 317: Hell-fire was split between two lines for spacing purposes.\nThe decision to retain the hyphen in the transcription is traced to a\nprior use of the word in this novel. On Page 40, hell-fire was spelled\nwith a hyphen, and the word was in the middle of a line.\nOn Page 321 and Page 322, changed double quotes nested inside of double\nquotes to single quotes. For example, “Ay, ay!” became ‘Ay, ay!’\nPage 338: Place period after all the tribes.\nPage 375: Remove comma after tinkle of a guitar.\nPage 385: Was Mounsier de Saint-Gré at home? This question should end in\na question mark but the author put a period there—and so did we.\nPage 426: Ignored hyphen in black forest-swamp. In print, the hyphen\noccurred at the end of a line. However, the novel writes “forest swamp”\non Page 51 and “forest swamps” on Page 216--and never uses \n“forest-swamp.” This inconsistency was assumed to be a publisher's\nmistake in typesetting.\nPage 448: “fianancier” may be dialect, but in other quotes of characters\nit is spelled “financier.” See Page 192, Page 250, and Page 283. No\nchange was made.\nPage 494: The verse following Caroline is printed to sheet music in the\nbook.\nPage 588: The preposition “to” is missing from the following phrase:\n“she drew the ivory from her gown and gave it me.” “Gave it to me”\nsounds better. Nevertheless, the sentence was written without the to,\nand it remains as the author wrote it in the e-book.\n\nSome inconsistencies were highlighted above, but there also were\ninstances where New Orléans was given an acute accent, but more often\nso, it was not. The same occurred with Miró. Another inconsistency was\nthe author italicizing banquette and piastre as part of his rule of\nitalicizing foreign words, but failing to do so all the time. We\nretained these inconsistencies in transcribing the book.\n\nThere were some cases where it was difficult to distinguish whether\nthere was or was not a space before 'll. The contraction 'll was not\nspaced for common contractions, such as I'll, he'll, they'll. However,\nthere was a space for “Breed 'll”, “what 'll”, “M'lisse 'll”, and other\nuncommon contractions formed with 'll. Sometimes, with line compression\nto justify the text, it is difficult to tell whether there should, or\nshould not, be a space between the two parts of the uncommon\ncontraction. In those cases where it was difficult to tell, we applied\nthe convention as stated above.\n\nTwo confusing passages to transcribe are Davy's narration on Page 284\nand Page 285 and Hélène's narration on Page 583. Other paragraphs\ncontain quotes embedded within quotes. We changed double quotes nested\ninside of double quotes to single quotes because our error-checking\nutilities flag the second double quote as an error."
