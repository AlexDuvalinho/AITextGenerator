A typical old\nshell-back, round-shouldered, hooked of finger; a figure with strong\nhints of a crab about it.\n\nHis face was like a moon, seen red through tropical mists; and as he\nplayed it wore an expression of strained attention as though the fiddle\nwere telling him tales much more marvellous than the old bald statement\nabout Bantry Bay.\n\n“Left-handed Pat,” was his fo’cs’le name; not because he was\nleft-handed, but simply because everything he did he did wrong—or\nnearly so. Reefing or furling, or handling a slush tub—if a mistake\nwas to be made, he made it.\n\nHe was a Celt, and all the salt seas that had flowed between him and\nConnaught these forty years and more had not washed the Celtic element\nfrom his blood, nor the belief in fairies from his soul. The Celtic\nnature is a fast dye, and Mr Button’s nature was such that though he\nhad been shanghaied by Larry Marr in ’Frisco, though he had got drunk\nin most ports of the world, though he had sailed with Yankee captains\nand been man-handled by Yankee mates, he still carried his fairies\nabout with him—they, and a very large stock of original innocence.\n\nNearly over the musician’s head swung a hammock from which hung a leg;\nother hammocks hanging in the semi-gloom called up suggestions of\nlemurs and arboreal bats. The swinging kerosene lamp cast its light\nforward, past the heel of the bowsprit to the knightheads, lighting here\na naked foot hanging over the side of a bunk, here a face from which\nprotruded a pipe, here a breast covered with dark mossy hair, here an\narm tattooed.\n\nIt was in the days before double topsail yards had reduced ships’\ncrews, and the fo’cs’le of the _Northumberland_ had a full company: a\ncrowd of packet rats such as often is to be found on a Cape Horner\n“Dutchmen” Americans—men who were farm labourers and tending\npigs in Ohio three months back, old seasoned sailors like Paddy\nButton—a mixture of the best and the worst of the earth, such as you\nfind nowhere else in so small a space as in a ship’s fo’cs’le.\n\nThe _Northumberland_ had experienced a terrible rounding of the Horn.\nBound from New Orleans to ’Frisco she had spent thirty days battling\nwith head-winds and storms—down there, where the seas are so vast that\nthree waves may cover with their amplitude more than a mile of sea\nspace; thirty days she had passed off Cape Stiff, and just now, at the\nmoment of this story, she was locked in a calm south of the line.\n\nMr Button finished his tune with a sweep of the bow, and drew his right\ncoat sleeve across his forehead. Then he took out a sooty pipe, filled\nit with tobacco, and lit it.\n\n“Pawthrick,” drawled a voice from the hammock above, from which\ndepended the leg, “what was that yarn you wiz beginnin’ to spin ter\nnight ’bout a lip me dawn?”\n\n“A which me dawn?” asked Mr Button, cocking his eye up at the bottom of\nthe hammock while he held the match to his pipe.\n\n“It vas about a green thing,” came a sleepy Dutch voice from a bunk.\n\n“Oh, a Leprachaun you mane. Sure, me mother’s sister had one down in\nConnaught.”\n\n“Vat vas it like?” asked the dreamy Dutch voice—a voice seemingly\npossessed by the calm that had made the sea like a mirror for the last\nthree days, reducing the whole ship’s company meanwhile to the level of\nwasters.\n\n“Like? Sure, it was like a Leprachaun; and what else would it be like?”\n\n“What like vas that?” persisted the voice.\n\n“It was like a little man no bigger than a big forked raddish, an’ as\ngreen as a cabbidge. Me a’nt had one in her house down in Connaught in\nthe ould days. O musha! musha! the ould days, the ould days! Now, you\nmay b’lave me or b’lave me not, but you could have put him in your\npocket, and the grass-green head of him wouldn’t more than’v stuck out.\nShe kept him in a cupboard, and out of the cupboard he’d pop if it was\na crack open, an’ into the milk pans he’d be, or under the beds, or\npullin’ the stool from under you, or at some other divarsion. He’d\nchase the pig—the crathur!—till it’d be all ribs like an ould\numbrilla with the fright, an’ as thin as a greyhound with the runnin’\nby the marnin; he’d addle the eggs so the cocks an’ hens wouldn’t know\nwhat they wis afther wid the chickens comin’ out wid two heads on them,\nan’ twinty-seven legs fore and aft. And you’d start to chase him, an’\nthen it’d be mainsail haul, and away he’d go, you behint him, till\nyou’d landed tail over snout in a ditch, an’ he’d be back in the\ncupboard.”\n\n“He was a Troll,” murmured the Dutch voice.\n\n“I’m tellin’ you he was a Leprachaun, and there’s no knowin’ the\ndivilments he’d be up to. He’d pull the cabbidge, maybe, out of the pot\nboilin’ on the fire forenint your eyes, and baste you in the face with\nit; and thin, maybe, you’d hold out your fist to him, and he’d put a\ngoulden soverin in it.”\n\n“Wisht he was here!” murmured a voice from a bunk near the knightheads.\n\n“Pawthrick,” drawled the voice from the hammock above, “what’d you do\nfirst if you found y’self with twenty pound in your pocket?”\n\n“What’s the use of askin’ me?” replied Mr Button. “What’s the use of\ntwenty pound to a sayman at say, where the grog’s all wather an’ the\nbeef’s all horse? Gimme it ashore, an’ you’d see what I’d do wid it!”\n\n“I guess the nearest grog-shop keeper wouldn’t see you comin’ for\ndust,” said a voice from Ohio.\n\n“He would not,” said Mr Button; “nor you afther me. Be damned to the\ngrog and thim that sells it!”\n\n“It’s all darned easy to talk,” said Ohio. “You curse the grog at sea\nwhen you can’t get it; set you ashore, and you’re bung full.”\n\n“I likes me dhrunk,” said Mr Button, “I’m free to admit; an’ I’m the\ndivil when it’s in me, and it’ll be the end of me yet, or me ould\nmother was a liar. ‘Pat,’ she says, first time I come home from say\nrowlin’, ‘storms you may escape, an’ wimmen you may escape, but the\npotheen ’ill have you.’ Forty year ago—forty year ago!”\n\n“Well,” said Ohio, “it hasn’t had you yet.”\n\n“No,” replied Mr Button, “but it will.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nUNDER THE STARS\n\nIt was a wonderful night up on deck, filled with all the majesty and\nbeauty of starlight and a tropic calm.\n\nThe Pacific slept; a vast, vague swell flowing from far away down south\nunder the night, lifted the _Northumberland_ on its undulations to the\nrattling sound of the reef points and the occasional creak of the\nrudder; whilst overhead, near the fiery arch of the Milky Way, hung the\nSouthern Cross like a broken kite.\n\nStars in the sky, stars in the sea, stars by the million and the\nmillion; so many lamps ablaze that the firmament filled the mind with\nthe idea of a vast and populous city—yet from all that living and\nflashing splendour not a sound.\n\nDown in the cabin—or saloon, as it was called by courtesy—were seated\nthe three passengers of the ship; one reading at the table, two playing\non the floor.\n\nThe man at the table, Arthur Lestrange, was seated with his large,\ndeep-sunken eyes fixed on a book. He was most evidently in\nconsumption—very near, indeed, to reaping the result of that last and\nmost desperate remedy, a long sea voyage.\n\nEmmeline Lestrange, his little niece—eight years of age, a mysterious\nmite, small for her age, with thoughts of her own, wide-pupilled eyes\nthat seemed the doors for visions, and a face that seemed just to have\npeeped into this world for a moment ere it was as suddenly\nwithdrawn—sat in a corner nursing something in her arms, and rocking\nherself to the tune of her own thoughts.\n\nDick, Lestrange’s little son, eight and a bit, was somewhere under the\ntable. They were Bostonians, bound for San Francisco, or rather for the\nsun and splendour of Los Angeles, where Lestrange had bought a small\nestate, hoping there to enjoy the life whose lease would be renewed by\nthe long sea voyage.\n\nAs he sat reading, the cabin door opened, and appeared an angular\nfemale form. This was Mrs Stannard, the stewardess, and Mrs Stannard\nmeant bedtime.\n\n“Dicky,” said Mr Lestrange, closing his book, and raising the\ntable-cloth a few inches, “bedtime.”\n\n“Oh, not yet, daddy!” came a sleep-freighted voice from under the\ntable; “I ain’t ready. I dunno want to go to bed, I— Hi yow!”\n\nMrs Stannard, who knew her work, had stooped under the table, seized him\nby the foot, and hauled him out kicking and fighting and blubbering all\nat the same time.\n\nAs for Emmeline, she having glanced up and recognised the inevitable,\nrose to her feet, and, holding the hideous rag-doll she had been\nnursing, head down and dangling in one hand, she stood waiting till\nDicky, after a few last perfunctory bellows, suddenly dried his eyes\nand held up a tear-wet face for his father to kiss. Then she presented\nher brow solemnly to her uncle, received a kiss and vanished, led by\nthe hand into a cabin on the port side of the saloon.\n\nMr Lestrange returned to his book, but he had not read for long when\nthe cabin door was opened, and Emmeline, in her nightdress, reappeared,\nholding a brown paper parcel in her hand, a parcel of about the same\nsize as the book you are reading.\n\n“My box,” said she; and as she spoke, holding it up as if to prove its\nsafety, the little plain face altered to the face of an angel.\n\nShe had smiled.\n\nWhen Emmeline Lestrange smiled it was absolutely as if the light of\nParadise had suddenly flashed upon her face: the happiest form of\nchildish beauty suddenly appeared before your eyes, dazzled them—and\nwas gone.\n\nThen she vanished with her box, and Mr Lestrange resumed his book.\n\nThis box of Emmeline’s, I may say in parenthesis, had given more\ntrouble aboard ship than all of the rest of the passengers’ luggage put\ntogether.\n\nIt had been presented to her on her departure from Boston by a lady\nfriend, and what it contained was a dark secret to all on board, save\nits owner and her uncle; she was a woman, or, at all events, the\nbeginning of a woman, yet she kept this secret to herself—a fact which\nyou will please note.\n\nThe trouble of the thing was that it was frequently being lost.\nSuspecting herself, maybe, as an unpractical dreamer in a world filled\nwith robbers, she would cart it about with her for safety, sit down\nbehind a coil of rope and fall into a fit of abstraction: be recalled\nto life by the evolutions of the crew reefing or furling or what not,\nrise to superintend the operations—and then suddenly find she had lost\nher box.\n\nThen she would absolutely haunt the ship. Wide-eyed and distressed of\nface she would wander hither and thither, peeping into the galley,\npeeping down the forescuttle, never uttering a word or wail, searching\nlike an uneasy ghost, but dumb.\n\nShe seemed ashamed to tell of her loss, ashamed to let any one know of\nit; but every one knew of it directly they saw her, to use Mr Button’s\nexpression, “on the wandher,” and every one hunted for it.\n\nStrangely enough it was Paddy Button who usually found it. He who was\nalways doing the wrong thing in the eyes of men, generally did the\nright thing in the eyes of children. Children, in fact, when they could\nget at Mr Button, went for him _con amore_. He was as attractive to them\nas a Punch and Judy show or a German band—almost.\n\nMr Lestrange after a while closed the book he was reading, looked\naround him and sighed.\n\nThe cabin of the _Northumberland_ was a cheerful enough place, pierced\nby the polished shaft of the mizzen mast, carpeted with an Axminster\ncarpet, and garnished with mirrors let into the white pine panelling.\nLestrange was staring at the reflection of his own face in one of these\nmirrors fixed just opposite to where he sat.\n\nHis emaciation was terrible, and it was just perhaps at this moment\nthat he first recognised the fact that he must not only die, but die\nsoon.\n\nHe turned from the mirror and sat for a while with his chin resting\nupon his hand, and his eyes fixed on an ink spot upon the table-cloth;\nthen he arose, and crossing the cabin climbed laboriously up the\ncompanion-way to the deck.\n\nAs he leaned against the bulwark rail to recover his breath, the\nsplendour and beauty of the Southern night struck him to the heart with\na cruel pang. He took his seat on a deck chair and gazed up at the\nMilky Way, that great triumphal arch built of suns that the dawn would\nsweep away like a dream.\n\nIn the Milky Way, near the Southern Cross, occurs a terrible circular\nabyss, the Coal Sack. So sharply defined is it, so suggestive of a void\nand bottomless cavern, that the contemplation of it afflicts the\nimaginative mind with vertigo. To the naked eye it is as black and as\ndismal as death, but the smallest telescope reveals it beautiful and\npopulous with stars.\n\nLestrange’s eyes travelled from this mystery to the burning cross, and\nthe nameless and numberless stars reaching to the sea-line, where they\npaled and vanished in the light of the rising moon. Then he became\naware of a figure promenading the quarter-deck. It was the “Old Man.”\n\nA sea captain is always the “old man,” be his age what it may. Captain\nLe Farges’ age might have been forty-five. He was a sailor of the Jean\nBart type, of French descent, but a naturalised American.\n\n“I don’t know where the wind’s gone,” said the captain as he drew near\nthe man in the deck chair. “I guess it’s blown a hole in the firmament,\nand escaped somewheres to the back of beyond.”\n\n“It’s been a long voyage,” said Lestrange; “and I’m thinking, Captain,\nit will be a very long voyage for me. My port’s not ’Frisco; I feel it.”\n\n“Don’t you be thinking that sort of thing,” said the other, taking his\nseat in a chair close by. “There’s no manner of use forecastin’ the\nweather a month ahead. Now we’re in warm latitoods, your glass will\nrise steady, and you’ll be as right and spry as any one of us, before\nwe fetch the Golden Gates.”\n\n“I’m thinking about the children,” said Lestrange, seeming not to hear\nthe captain’s words. “Should anything happen to me before we reach\nport, I should like you to do something for me. It’s only this: dispose\nof my body without—without the children knowing. It has been in my\nmind to ask you this for some days. Captain, those children know\nnothing of death.”\n\nLe Farge moved uneasily in his chair.\n\n“Little Emmeline’s mother died when she was two. Her father—my\nbrother—died before she was born. Dicky never knew a mother; she died\ngiving him birth. My God, Captain, death has laid a heavy hand on my\nfamily; can you wonder that I have hid his very name from those two\ncreatures that I love!”\n\n“Ay, ay,” said Le Farge, “it’s sad! it’s sad!”\n\n“When I was quite a child,” went on Lestrange, “a child no older than\nDicky, my nurse used to terrify me with tales about dead people. I was\ntold I’d go to hell when I died if I wasn’t a good child. I cannot tell\nyou how much that has poisoned my life, for the thoughts we think in\nchildhood, Captain, are the fathers of the thoughts we think when we\nare grown up. And can a diseased father—have healthy children?”\n\n“I guess not.”\n\n“So I just said, when these two tiny creatures came into my care, that\nI would do all in my power to protect them from the terrors of life—or\nrather, I should say, from the terror of death. I don’t know whether I\nhave done right, but I have done it for the best. They had a cat, and\none day Dicky came in to me and said: ‘Father, pussy’s in the garden\nasleep, and I can’t wake her.’ So I just took him out for a walk; there\nwas a circus in the town, and I took him to it. It so filled his mind\nthat he quite forgot the cat. Next day he asked for her. I did not tell\nhim she was buried in the garden, I just said she must have run away.\nIn a week he had forgotten all about her—children soon forget.”\n\n“Ay, that’s true,” said the sea captain. “But ’pears to me they must\nlearn some time they’ve got to die.”\n\n“Should I pay the penalty before we reach land, and be cast into that\ngreat, vast sea, I would not wish the children’s dreams to be haunted\nby the thought: just tell them I’ve gone on board another ship. You\nwill take them back to Boston; I have here, in a letter, the name of a\nlady who will care for them. Dicky will be well off, as far as worldly\ngoods are concerned, and so will Emmeline. Just tell them I’ve gone on\nboard another ship—children soon forget.”\n\n“I’ll do what you ask,” said the seaman.\n\nThe moon was over the horizon now, and the _Northumberland_ lay adrift in\na river of silver. Every spar was distinct, every reef point on the\ngreat sails, and the decks lay like spaces of frost cut by shadows\nblack as ebony.\n\nAs the two men sat without speaking, thinking their own thoughts, a\nlittle white figure emerged from the saloon hatch. It was Emmeline. She\nwas a professed sleepwalker—a past mistress of the art.\n\nScarcely had she stepped into dreamland than she had lost her precious\nbox, and now she was hunting for it on the decks of the _Northumberland_.\n\nMr Lestrange put his finger to his lips, took off his shoes and\nsilently followed her. She searched behind a coil of rope, she tried to\nopen the galley door; hither and thither she wandered, wide-eyed and\ntroubled of face, till at last, in the shadow of the hencoop, she found\nher visionary treasure. Then back she came, holding up her little\nnightdress with one hand, so as not to trip, and vanished down the\nsaloon companion very hurriedly, as if anxious to get back to bed, her\nuncle close behind, with one hand outstretched so as to catch her in\ncase she stumbled.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE SHADOW AND THE FIRE\n\nIt was the fourth day of the long calm. An awning had been rigged up on\nthe poop for the passengers, and under it sat Lestrange, trying to\nread, and the children trying to play. The heat and monotony had\nreduced even Dicky to just a surly mass, languid in movement as a grub.\nAs for Emmeline, she seemed dazed. The rag-doll lay a yard away from\nher on the poop deck unnursed; even the wretched box and its\nwhereabouts she seemed to have quite forgotten.\n\n“Daddy!” suddenly cried Dick, who had clambered up, and was looking\nover the after-rail.\n\n“What?”\n\n“Fish!”\n\nLestrange rose to his feet, came aft and looked over the rail.\n\nDown in the vague green of the water something moved, something pale\nand long—a ghastly form. It vanished; and yet another came, neared the\nsurface, and displayed itself more fully. Lestrange saw its eyes, he\nsaw the dark fin, and the whole hideous length of the creature; a\nshudder ran through him as he clasped Dicky.\n\n“Ain’t he fine?” said the child. “I guess, daddy, I’d pull him aboard\nif I had a hook. Why haven’t I a hook, daddy?—why haven’t I a hook,\ndaddy?— Ow, you’re _squeezin’_ me!”\n\nSomething plucked at Lestrange’s coat: it was Emmeline—she also wanted\nto look. He lifted her up in his arms; her little pale face peeped over\nthe rail, but there was nothing to see: the forms of terror had\nvanished, leaving the green depths untroubled and unstained.\n\n“What’s they called, daddy?” persisted Dick, as his father took him\ndown from the rail, and led him back to the chair.\n\n“Sharks,” said Lestrange, whose face was covered with perspiration.\n\nHe picked up the book he had been reading—it was a volume of\nTennyson—and he sat with it on his knees staring at the white sunlit\nmain-deck barred with the white shadows of the standing rigging.\n\nThe sea had disclosed to him a vision. Poetry, Philosophy, Beauty, Art,\nthe love and joy of life—was it possible that these should exist in\nthe same world as those?\n\nHe glanced at the book upon his knees, and contrasted the beautiful\nthings in it which he remembered with the terrible things he had just\nseen, the things that were waiting for their food under the keel of the\nship.\n\nIt was three bells—half-past three in the afternoon—and the ship’s\nbell had just rung out. The stewardess appeared to take the children\nbelow; and as they vanished down the saloon companion-way Captain Le\nFarge came aft, on to the poop, and stood for a moment looking over the\nsea on the port side, where a bank of fog had suddenly appeared like\nthe spectre of a country.\n\n“The sun has dimmed a bit,” said he; “I can a’most look at it. Glass\nsteady enough—there’s a fog coming up—ever seen a Pacific fog?”\n\n“No, never.”\n\n“Well, you won’t want to see another,” replied the mariner, shading his\neyes and fixing them upon the sea-line. The sea-line away to starboard\nhad lost somewhat its distinctness, and over the day an almost\nimperceptible shade had crept.\n\nThe captain suddenly turned from his contemplation of the sea and sky,\nraised his head and sniffed.\n\n“Something is burning somewhere—smell it? Seems to me like an old mat\nor summat. It’s that swab of a steward, maybe; if he isn’t breaking\nglass, he’s upsetting lamps and burning holes in the carpet. Bless _my_\nsoul, I’d sooner have a dozen Mary Anns an’ their dustpans round the\nplace than one tomfool steward like Jenkins.” He went to the saloon\nhatch. “Below there!”\n\n“Ay, ay, sir.”\n\n“What are you burning?”\n\n“I an’t burnin’ northen, sir.”\n\n“Tell you, I smell it!”\n\n“There’s northen burnin’ here, sir.”\n\n“Neither is there, it’s all on deck. Something in the galley,\nmaybe—rags, most likely, they’ve thrown on the fire.”\n\n“Captain!” said Lestrange.\n\n“Ay, ay.”\n\n“Come here, please.”\n\nLe Farge climbed on to the poop.\n\n“I don’t know whether it’s my weakness that’s affecting my eyes, but\nthere seems to me something strange about the main-mast.”\n\nThe main-mast near where it entered the deck, and for some distance up,\nseemed in motion—a corkscrew movement most strange to watch from the\nshelter of the awning.\n\nThis apparent movement was caused by a spiral haze of smoke so vague\nthat one could only tell of its existence from the mirage-like tremor\nof the mast round which it curled.\n\n“My God!” cried Le Farge, as he sprang from the poop and rushed forward.\n\nLestrange followed him slowly, stopping every moment to clutch the\nbulwark rail and pant for breath. He heard the shrill bird-like notes\nof the bosun’s pipe. He saw the hands emerging from the forecastle,\nlike bees out of a hive; he watched them surrounding the main-hatch. He\nwatched the tarpaulin and locking-bars removed. He saw the hatch\nopened, and a burst of smoke—black, villainous smoke—ascend to the\nsky, solid as a plume in the windless air.\n\nLestrange was a man of a highly nervous temperament, and it is just\nthis sort of man who keeps his head in an emergency, whilst your\nlevel-headed, phlegmatic individual loses his balance. His first\nthought was of the children, his second of the boats.\n\nIn the battering off Cape Horn the _Northumberland_ lost several of her\nboats. There were left the long-boat, a quarter-boat, and the dinghy.\nHe heard Le Farge’s voice ordering the hatch to be closed and the pumps\nmanned, so as to flood the hold; and, knowing that he could do nothing\non deck, he made as swiftly as he could for the saloon companion-way.\n\nMrs Stannard was just coming out of the children’s cabin.\n\n“Are the children lying down, Mrs Stannard?” asked Lestrange, almost\nbreathless from the excitement and exertion of the last few minutes.\n\nThe woman glanced at him with frightened eyes. He looked like the very\nherald of disaster.\n\n“For if they are, and you have undressed them, then you must put their\nclothes on again. The ship is on fire, Mrs Stannard.”\n\n“Good God, sir!”\n\n“Listen!” said Lestrange.\n\nFrom a distance, thin, and dreary as the crying of sea-gulls on a\ndesolate beach, came the clanking of the pumps.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nAND LIKE A DREAM DISSOLVED\n\nBefore the woman had time to speak a thunderous step was heard on the\ncompanion stairs, and Le Farge broke into the saloon. The man’s face\nwas injected with blood, his eyes were fixed and glassy like the eyes\nof a drunkard, and the veins stood on his temples like twisted cords.\n\n“Get those children ready!” he shouted, as he rushed into his own\ncabin. “Get you all ready—boats are being swung out and victualled.\nH--l! where are those papers?”\n\nThey heard him furiously searching and collecting things in his\ncabin—the ship’s papers, accounts, things the master mariner clings to\nas he clings to his life; and as he searched, and found, and packed, he\nkept bellowing orders for the children to be got on deck. Half mad he\nseemed, and half mad he was with the knowledge of the terrible thing\nthat was stowed amidst the cargo.\n\nUp on deck the crew, under the direction of the first mate, were\nworking in an orderly manner, and with a will, utterly unconscious of\nthere being anything beneath their feet but an ordinary cargo on fire.\nThe covers had been stripped from the boats, kegs of water and bags of\nbiscuit placed in them. The dinghy, smallest of the boats and most\neasily got away, was hanging at the port quarter-boat davits flush with\nthe bulwarks; and Paddy Button was in the act of stowing a keg of water\nin her, when Le Farge broke on to the deck, followed by the stewardess\ncarrying Emmeline, and Mr Lestrange leading Dick. The dinghy was rather\na larger boat than the ordinary ships’ dinghy, and possessed a small\nmast and long sail. Two sailors stood ready to man the falls, and Paddy\nButton was just turning to trundle forward again when the captain\nseized him.\n\n“Into the dinghy with you,” he cried, “and row these children and the\npassenger out a mile from the ship—two miles—three miles—make an\noffing.”\n\n“Sure, Captain dear, I’ve left me fiddle in the——”\n\nLe Farge dropped the bundle of things he was holding under his left\narm, seized the old sailor and rushed him against the bulwarks, as if\nhe meant to fling him into the sea _through_ the bulwarks.\n\nNext moment Mr Button was in the boat. Emmeline was handed to him, pale\nof face and wide-eyed, and clasping something wrapped in a little\nshawl; then Dick, and then Mr Lestrange was helped over.\n\n“No room for more!” cried Le Farge. “Your place will be in the\nlong-boat, Mrs Stannard, if we have to leave the ship. Lower away,\nlower away!”\n\nThe boat sank towards the smooth blue sea, kissed it and was afloat.\n\nNow Mr Button, before joining the ship at Boston, had spent a good\nwhile lingering by the quay, having no money wherewith to enjoy himself\nin a tavern. He had seen something of the lading of the _Northumberland_,\nand heard more from a stevedore. No sooner had he cast off the falls\nand seized the oars, than his knowledge awoke in his mind, living and\nlurid. He gave a whoop that brought the two sailors leaning over the\nside.\n\n“Bullies!”\n\n“Ay, ay!”\n\n“Run for your lives—I’ve just rimimbered—there’s two bar’ls of\nblastin’ powther in the hould!”\n\nThen he bent to his oars, as no man ever bent before.\n\nLestrange, sitting in the stern-sheets clasping Emmeline and Dick,\nsaw nothing for a moment after hearing these words. The children,\nwho knew nothing of blasting powder or its effects, though half\nfrightened by all the bustle and excitement, were still amused\nand pleased at finding themselves in the little boat so close to\nthe blue pretty sea.\n\nDick put his finger over the side, so that it made a ripple in the\nwater (the most delightful experience of childhood). Emmeline, with one\nhand clasped in her uncle’s, watched Mr Button with a grave sort of\nhalf pleasure.\n\nHe certainly was a sight worth watching. His soul was filled with\ntragedy and terror. His Celtic imagination heard the ship blowing up,\nsaw himself and the little dinghy blown to pieces—nay, saw himself in\nhell, being toasted by “divils.”\n\nBut tragedy and terror could find no room for expression on his\nfortunate or unfortunate face. He puffed and he blew, bulging his\ncheeks out at the sky as he tugged at the oars, making a hundred and\none grimaces—all the outcome of agony of mind, but none expressing it.\nBehind lay the ship, a picture not without its lighter side. The\nlong-boat and the quarter-boat, lowered with a rush and seaborne by the\nmercy of Providence, were floating by the side of the _Northumberland_.\n\nFrom the ship men were casting themselves overboard like water-rats,\nswimming in the water like ducks, scrambling on board the boats anyhow.\n\nFrom the half-opened main-hatch the black smoke, mixed now with sparks,\nrose steadily and swiftly and spitefully, as if driven through the\nhalf-closed teeth of a dragon.\n\nA mile away beyond the _Northumberland_ stood the fog bank. It looked\nsolid, like a vast country that had suddenly and strangely built itself\non the sea—a country where no birds sang and no trees grew. A country\nwith white, precipitous cliffs, solid to look at as the cliffs of Dover.\n\n“I’m spint!” suddenly gasped the oarsman, resting the oar handles under\nthe crook of his knees, and bending down as if he was preparing to butt\nat the passengers in the stern-sheets. “Blow up or blow down, I’m\nspint—don’t ax me, I’m spint!”\n\nMr Lestrange, white as a ghost, but recovered somewhat from his first\nhorror, gave the Spent One time to recover himself and turned to look\nat the ship. She seemed a great distance off, and the boats, well away\nfrom her, were making at a furious pace towards the dinghy. Dick was\nstill playing with the water, but Emmeline’s eyes were entirely\noccupied with Paddy Button. New things were always of vast interest to\nher contemplative mind, and these evolutions of her old friend were\neminently new.\n\nShe had seen him swilling the decks, she had seen him dancing a jig,\nshe had seen him going round the main deck on all fours with Dick on\nhis back, but she had never seen him going on like this before.\n\nShe perceived now that he was exhausted, and in trouble about\nsomething, and, putting her hand in the pocket of her dress, she\nsearched for something that she knew was there. She produced a\nTangerine orange, and leaning forward she touched the Spent One’s head\nwith it.\n\nMr Button raised his head, stared vacantly for a second, saw the\nproffered orange, and at the sight of it the thought of “the childer”\nand their innocence, himself and the blasting powder, cleared his\ndazzled wits, and he took to the sculls again.\n\n“Daddy,” said Dick, who had been looking astern, “there’s clouds near\nthe ship.”\n\nIn an incredibly short space of time the solid cliffs of fog had\nbroken. The faint wind that had banked it had pierced it, and was now\nmaking pictures and devices of it, most wonderful and weird to see.\nHorsemen of the mist rode on the water, and were dissolved; billows\nrolled on the sea, yet were not of the sea; blankets and spirals of\nvapour ascended to high heaven. And all with a terrible languor of\nmovement. Vast and lazy and sinister, yet steadfast of purpose as Fate\nor Death, the fog advanced, taking the world for its own.\n\nAgainst this grey and indescribably sombre background stood the\nsmouldering ship with the breeze already shivering in her sails, and\nthe smoke from her main-hatch blowing and beckoning as if to the\nretreating boats.\n\n“Why’s the ship smoking like that?” asked Dick. “And look at those\nboats coming—when are we going back, daddy?”\n\n“Uncle,” said Emmeline, putting her hand in his, as she gazed towards\nthe ship and beyond it, “I’m ’fraid.”\n\n“What frightens you, Emmy?” he asked, drawing her to him.\n\n“Shapes,” replied Emmeline, nestling up to his side.\n\n“Oh, Glory be to God!” gasped the old sailor, suddenly resting on his\noars. “Will yiz look at the fog that’s comin’—”\n\n“I think we had better wait here for the boats,” said Mr Lestrange; “we\nare far enough now to be safe if—anything happens.”\n\n“Ay, ay,” replied the oarsman, whose wits had returned. “Blow up or\nblow down, she won’t hit us from here.”\n\n“Daddy,” said Dick, “when are we going back? I want my tea.”\n\n“We aren’t going back, my child,” replied his father. “The ship’s on\nfire; we are waiting for another ship.”\n\n“Where’s the other ship?” asked the child, looking round at the horizon\nthat was clear.\n\n“We can’t see it yet,” replied the unhappy man, “but it will come.”\n\nThe long-boat and the quarter-boat were slowly approaching. They looked\nlike beetles crawling over the water, and after them across the\nglittering surface came a dullness that took the sparkle from the\nsea—a dullness that swept and spread like an eclipse shadow.\n\nNow the wind struck the dinghy. It was like a wind from fairyland,\nalmost imperceptible, chill, and dimming the sun. A wind from Lilliput.\nAs it struck the dinghy, the fog took the distant ship.\n\nIt was a most extraordinary sight, for in less than thirty seconds the\nship of wood became a ship of gauze, a tracery—flickered, and was gone\nforever from the sight of man.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nVOICES HEARD IN THE MIST\n\nThe sun became fainter still, and vanished. Though the air round the\ndinghy seemed quite clear, the on-coming boats were hazy and dim, and\nthat part of the horizon that had been fairly clear was now blotted out.\n\nThe long-boat was leading by a good way. When she was within hailing\ndistance the captain’s voice came.\n\n“Dinghy ahoy!”\n\n“Ahoy!”\n\n“Fetch alongside here!”\n\nThe long-boat ceased rowing to wait for the quarter-boat that was\nslowly creeping up. She was a heavy boat to pull at all times, and now\nshe was overloaded.\n\nThe wrath of Captain Le Farge with Paddy Button for the way he had\nstampeded the crew was profound, but he had not time to give vent to it.\n\n“Here, get aboard us, Mr Lestrange!” said he, when the dinghy was\nalongside; “we have room for one. Mrs Stannard is in the quarter-boat,\nand it’s overcrowded; she’s better aboard the dinghy, for she can look\nafter the kids. Come, hurry up, the smother is coming down on us fast.\nAhoy!”—to the quarter-boat—“hurry up, hurry up!”\n\nThe quarter-boat had suddenly vanished.\n\nMr Lestrange climbed into the long-boat. Paddy pushed the dinghy a few\nyards away with the tip of a scull, and then lay on his oars waiting.\n\n“Ahoy! ahoy!” cried Le Farge.\n\n“Ahoy!” came from the fog bank.\n\nNext moment the long-boat and the dinghy vanished from each other’s\nsight: the great fog bank had taken them.\n\nNow a couple of strokes of the port scull would have brought Mr Button\nalongside the long-boat, so close was he; but the quarter-boat was in\nhis mind, or rather imagination, so what must he do but take three\npowerful strokes in the direction in which he fancied the quarter-boat\nto be.\n\nThe rest was voices.\n\n“Dinghy ahoy!”\n\n“Ahoy!”\n\n“Ahoy!”\n\n“Don’t be shoutin’ together, or I’ll not know which way to pull.\nQuarter-boat ahoy! where are yiz?”\n\n“Port your helm!”\n\n“Ay, ay!”—putting his helm, so to speak, to starboard—“I’ll be wid yiz\nin wan minute—two or three minutes’ hard pulling.”\n\n“Ahoy!”—much more faint.\n\n“What d’ye mane rowin’ away from me?”—a dozen strokes.\n\n“Ahoy!”—fainter still.\n\nMr Button rested on his oars.\n\n“Divil mend them—I b’lave that was the long-boat shoutin’.”\n\nHe took to his oars again and pulled vigorously.\n\n“Paddy,” came Dick’s small voice, apparently from nowhere, “where are\nwe now?”\n\n“Sure, we’re in a fog; where else would we be? Don’t you be affeared.”\n\n“I ain’t affeared, but Em’s shivering.”\n\n“Give her me coat,” said the oarsman, resting on his oars and taking it\noff. “Wrap it round her; and when it’s round her we’ll all let one big\nhalloo together. There’s an ould shawl som’er in the boat, but I can’t\nbe after lookin’ for it now.”\n\nHe held out the coat and an almost invisible hand took it; at the same\nmoment a tremendous report shook the sea and sky.\n\n“There she goes,” said Mr Button; “an’ me old fiddle an’ all. Don’t be\nfrightened, childer; it’s only a gun they’re firin’ for divarsion. Now\nwe’ll all halloo togither—are yiz ready?”\n\n“Ay, ay,” said Dick, who was a picker-up of sea terms.\n\n“Halloo!” yelled Pat.\n\n“Halloo! Halloo!” piped Dick and Emmeline.\n\nA faint reply came, but from where, it was difficult to say. The old\nman rowed a few strokes and then paused on his oars. So still was the\nsurface of the sea that the chuckling of the water at the boat’s bow as\nshe drove forward under the impetus of the last powerful stroke could\nbe heard distinctly. It died out as she lost way, and silence closed\nround them like a ring.\n\nThe light from above, a light that seemed to come through a vast\nscuttle of deeply-muffed glass, faint though it was, almost to\nextinction, still varied as the little boat floated through the strata\nof the mist.\n\nA great sea fog is not homogeneous—its density varies: it is\nhoneycombed with streets, it has its caves of clear air, its cliffs of\nsolid vapour, all shifting and changing place with the subtlety of\nlegerdemain. It has also this wizard peculiarity, that it grows with\nthe sinking of the sun and the approach of darkness.\n\nThe sun, could they have seen it, was now leaving the horizon.\n\nThey called again. Then they waited, but there was no response.\n\n“There’s no use bawlin’ like bulls to chaps that’s deaf as adders,”\nsaid the old sailor, shipping his oars; immediately upon which\ndeclaration he gave another shout, with the same result as far as\neliciting a reply.\n\n“Mr Button!” came Emmeline’s voice.\n\n“What is it, honey?”\n\n“I’m—m—’fraid.”\n\n“You wait wan minit till I find the shawl—here it is, by the same\ntoken!—an’ I’ll wrap you up in it.”\n\nHe crept cautiously aft to the stern-sheets and took Emmeline in his\narms.\n\n“Don’t want the shawl,” said Emmeline; “I’m not so much afraid in your\ncoat.” The rough, tobacco-smelling old coat gave her courage somehow.\n\n“Well, thin, keep it on. Dicky, are you cowld?”\n\n“I’ve got into daddy’s great-coat; he left it behind him.”\n\n“Well, thin, I’ll put the shawl round me own shoulders, for it’s cowld\nI am. Are y’ hungry, childer?”\n\n“No,” said Dick, “but I’m drefful—Hi—yow——”\n\n“Slapy, is it? Well, down you get in the bottom of the boat, and here’s\nthe shawl for a pilla. I’ll be rowin’ again in a minit to keep meself\nwarm.”\n\nHe buttoned the top button of the coat.\n\n“I’m a’right,” murmured Emmeline in a dreamy voice.\n\n“Shut your eyes tight,” replied Mr Button, “or Billy Winker will be\ndridgin’ sand in them.\n\n  “’Shoheen, shoheen, shoheen, shoheen,\n  Sho-hu-lo, sho-hu-lo.\n  Shoheen, shoheen, shoheen, shoheen,\n  Hush a by the babby O.’”\n\nIt was the tag of an old nursery folk-song they sing in the hovels of\nthe Achill coast fixed in his memory, along with the rain and the wind\nand the smell of the burning turf, and the grunting of the pig and the\nknickety-knock of a rocking cradle.\n\n“She’s off,” murmured Mr Button to himself, as the form in his arms\nrelaxed. Then he laid her gently down beside Dick. He shifted forward,\nmoving like a crab. Then he put his hand to his pocket for his pipe and\ntobacco and tinder box. They were in his coat pocket, but Emmeline was\nin his coat. To search for them would be to awaken her.\n\nThe darkness of night was now adding itself to the blindness of the\nfog. The oarsman could not see even the thole pins. He sat adrift mind\nand body. He was, to use his own expression, “moithered.” Haunted by\nthe mist, tormented by “shapes.”\n\nIt was just in a fog like this that the Merrows could be heard\ndisporting in Dunbeg bay, and off the Achill coast. Sporting and\nlaughing, and hallooing through the mist, to lead unfortunate fishermen\nastray.\n\nMerrows are not altogether evil, but they have green hair and teeth,\nfishes’ tails and fins for arms; and to hear them walloping in the\nwater around you like salmon, and you alone in a small boat, with the\ndread of one coming floundering on board, is enough to turn a man’s\nhair grey.\n\nFor a moment he thought of awakening the children to keep him company,\nbut he was ashamed. Then he took to the sculls again, and rowed “by the\nfeel of the water.” The creak of the oars was like a companion’s voice,\nthe exercise lulled his fears. Now and again, forgetful of the sleeping\nchildren, he gave a halloo, and paused to listen. But no answer came.\n\nThen he continued rowing, long, steady, laborious strokes, each taking\nhim further and further from the boats that he was never destined to\nsight again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nDAWN ON A WIDE, WIDE SEA\n\n“Is it aslape I’ve been?” said Mr Button, suddenly awaking with a start.\n\nHe had shipped his oars just for a minute’s rest. He must have slept\nfor hours, for now, behold! a warm, gentle wind was blowing, the moon\nwas shining, and the fog was gone.\n\n“Is it dhraming I’ve been?” continued the awakened one. “Where am I at\nall, at all? O musha! sure, here I am. O wirra! wirra! I dreamt I’d\ngone aslape on the main-hatch and the ship was blown up with powther,\nand it’s all come true.”\n\n“Mr Button!” came a small voice from the stern-sheets (Emmeline’s).\n\n“What is it, honey?”\n\n“Where are we now?”\n\n“Sure, we’re afloat on the say, acushla; where else would we be?”\n\n“Where’s uncle?”\n\n“He’s beyant there in the long-boat—he’ll be afther us in a minit.”\n\n“I want a drink.”\n\nHe filled a tin pannikin that was by the beaker of water, and gave her\na drink. Then he took his pipe and tobacco from his coat pocket.\n\nShe almost immediately fell asleep again beside Dick, who had not\nstirred or moved; and the old sailor, standing up and steadying\nhimself, cast his eyes round the horizon. Not a sign of sail or boat\nwas there on all the moonlit sea.\n\nFrom the low elevation of an open boat one has a very small horizon,\nand in the vague world of moonlight somewhere round about it was\npossible that the boats might be near enough to show up at daybreak.\n\nBut open boats a few miles apart may be separated by long leagues in\nthe course of a few hours. Nothing is more mysterious than the currents\nof the sea.\n\nThe ocean is an ocean of rivers, some swiftly flowing, some slow, and a\nleague from where you are drifting at the rate of a mile an hour\nanother boat may be drifting two.\n\nA slight warm breeze was frosting the water, blending moonshine and\nstar shimmer; the ocean lay like a lake, yet the nearest mainland was\nperhaps a thousand miles away.\n\nThe thoughts of youth may be long, long thoughts, but not longer than\nthe thoughts of this old sailor man smoking his pipe under the stars.\nThoughts as long as the world is round. Blazing bar rooms in\nCallao—harbours over whose oily surfaces the sampans slipped like\nwater-beetles—the lights of Macao—the docks of London. Scarcely ever\na sea picture, pure and simple, for why should an old seaman care to\nthink about the sea, where life is all into the fo’cs’le and out again,\nwhere one voyage blends and jumbles with another, where after\nforty-five years of reefing topsails you can’t well remember off which\nship it was Jack Rafferty fell overboard, or who it was killed who in\nthe fo’cs’le of what, though you can still see, as in a mirror darkly,\nthe fight, and the bloody face over which a man is holding a kerosene\nlamp.\n\nI doubt if Paddy Button could have told you the name of the first ship\nhe ever sailed in. If you had asked him, he would probably have\nreplied: “I disremimber; it was to the Baltic, and cruel cowld weather,\nand I was say-sick—till I near brought me boots up; and it was ‘O for\nould Ireland!’ I was cryin’ all the time, an’ the captin dhrummin me\nback with a rope’s end to the tune uv it—but the name of the hooker—I\ndisremimber—bad luck to her, whoever she was!”\n\nSo he sat smoking his pipe, whilst the candles of heaven burned above\nhim, and calling to mind roaring drunken scenes and palm-shadowed\nharbours, and the men and the women he had known—such men and such\nwomen! The derelicts of the earth and the ocean. Then he nodded off to\nsleep again, and when he awoke the moon had gone.\n\nNow in the eastern sky might have been seen a pale fan of light, vague\nas the wing of an ephemera. It vanished and changed back to darkness.\n\nPresently, and almost at a stroke, a pencil of fire ruled a line along\nthe eastern horizon, and the eastern sky became more beautiful than a\nrose leaf plucked in May. The line of fire contracted into one\nincreasing spot, the rim of the rising sun.\n\nAs the light increased the sky above became of a blue impossible to\nimagine unless seen, a wan blue, yet living and sparkling as if born of\nthe impalpable dust of sapphires. Then the whole sea flashed like the\nharp of Apollo touched by the fingers of the god. The light was music\nto the soul. It was day.\n\n“Daddy!” suddenly cried Dick, sitting up in the sunlight and rubbing\nhis eyes with his open palms. “Where are we?”\n\n“All right, Dicky, me son!” cried the old sailor, who had been standing\nup casting his eyes round in a vain endeavour to sight the boats. “Your\ndaddy’s as safe as if he was in hivin; he’ll be wid us in a minit, an’\nbring another ship along with him. So you’re awake, are you, Em’line?”\n\nEmmeline, sitting up in the old pilot coat, nodded in reply without\nspeaking. Another child might have supplemented Dick’s enquiries as to\nher uncle by questions of her own, but she did not.\n\nDid she guess that there was some subterfuge in Mr Button’s answer, and\nthat things were different from what he was making them out to be? Who\ncan tell?\n\nShe was wearing an old cap of Dick’s, which Mrs Stannard in the hurry\nand confusion had popped on her head. It was pushed to one side, and\nshe made a quaint enough little figure as she sat up in the early\nmorning brightness, dressed in the old salt-stained coat beside Dick,\nwhose straw hat was somewhere in the bottom of the boat, and whose\nauburn locks were blowing in the faint breeze.\n\n“Hurroo!” cried Dick, looking around at the blue and sparkling water,\nand banging with a stretcher on the bottom of the boat. “I’m goin’ to\nbe a sailor, aren’t I, Paddy? You’ll let me sail the boat, won’t you,\nPaddy, an’ show me how to row?”\n\n“Aisy does it,” said Paddy, taking hold of the child. “I haven’t a\nsponge or towel, but I’ll just wash your face in salt wather and lave\nyou to dry in the sun.”\n\nHe filled the bailing tin with sea water.\n\n“I don’t want to wash!” shouted Dick.\n\n“Stick your face into the water in the tin,” commanded Paddy. “You\nwouldn’t be going about the place with your face like a sut-bag, would\nyou?”\n\n“Stick yours in!” commanded the other.\n\nMr Button did so, and made a hub-bubbling noise in the water; then he\nlifted a wet and streaming face, and flung the contents of the bailing\ntin overboard.\n\n“Now you’ve lost your chance,” said this arch nursery-strategist, “all\nthe water’s gone.”\n\n“There’s more in the sea.”\n\n“There’s no more to wash with, not till to-morrow—the fishes don’t\nallow it.”\n\n“I want to wash,” grumbled Dick. “I want to stick my face in the tin,\nsame’s you did; ’sides, Em hasn’t washed.”\n\n“_I_ don’t mind,” murmured Emmeline.\n\n“Well, thin,” said Mr Button, as if making a sudden resolve, “I’ll ax\nthe sharks.” He leaned over the boat’s side, his face close to the\nsurface of the water. “Halloo there!” he shouted, and then bent his\nhead sideways to listen; the children also looked over the side, deeply\ninterested.\n\n“Halloo there! Are y’aslape— Oh, there y’are! Here’s a spalpeen with a\ndhirty face, an’s wishful to wash it; may I take a bailin’ tin of— Oh,\nthank your ’arner, thank your ’arner—good day to you, and my respects.”\n\n“What did the shark say, Mr Button?” asked Emmeline.\n\n“He said: ‘Take a bar’l full, an’ welcome, Mister Button; an’ it’s\nwishful I am I had a drop of the crathur to offer you this fine\nmarnin’.’ Thin he popped his head under his fin and went aslape agin;\nleastwise, I heard him snore.”\n\nEmmeline nearly always “Mr Buttoned” her friend; sometimes she called\nhim “Mr Paddy.” As for Dick, it was always “Paddy,” pure and simple.\nChildren have etiquettes of their own.\n\nIt must often strike landsmen and landswomen that the most terrible\nexperience when cast away at sea in an open boat is the total absence\nof privacy. It seems an outrage on decency on the part of Providence to\nherd people together so. But, whoever has gone through the experience\nwill bear me out that in great moments of life like this the human mind\nenlarges, and things that would shock us ashore are as nothing out\nthere, face to face with eternity.\n\nIf so with grown-up people, how much more so with this old shell-back\nand his two charges?\n\nAnd indeed Mr Button was a person who called a spade a spade, had no\nmore conventions than a walrus, and looked after his two charges just\nas a nursemaid might look after her charges, or a walrus after its\nyoung.\n\nThere was a large bag of biscuits in the boat, and some tinned\nstuff—mostly sardines.\n\nI have known a sailor to open a box of sardines with a tin-tack. He was\nin prison, the sardines had been smuggled into him, and he had no\ncan-opener. Only his genius and a tin-tack.\n\nPaddy had a jack-knife, however, and in a marvellously short time a box\nof sardines was opened, and placed on the stern-sheets beside some\nbiscuits.\n\nThese, with some water and Emmeline’s Tangerine orange, which she\nproduced and added to the common store, formed the feast, and they fell\nto.\n\nWhen they had finished, the remains were put carefully away, and\nthey proceeded to step the tiny mast.\n\nThe sailor, when the mast was in its place, stood for a moment resting\nhis hand on it, and gazing around him over the vast and voiceless blue.\n\nThe Pacific has three blues: the blue of morning, the blue of midday,\nand the blue of evening. But the blue of morning is the happiest: the\nhappiest thing in colour—sparkling, vague, newborn—the blue of heaven\nand youth.\n\n“What are you looking for, Paddy?” asked Dick.\n\n“Say-gulls,” replied the prevaricator; then to himself: “Not a sight or\na sound of them! Musha! musha! which way will I steer—north, south,\naist, or west? It’s all wan, for if I steer to the aist, they may be in\nthe west; and if I steer to the west, they may be in the aist; and I\ncan’t steer to the west, for I’d be steering right in the wind’s eye.\nAist it is; I’ll make a soldier’s wind of it, and thrust to chance.”\n\nHe set the sail and came aft with the sheet. Then he shifted the\nrudder, lit a pipe, leaned luxuriously back and gave the bellying sail\nto the gentle breeze.\n\nIt was part of his profession, part of his nature, that, steering,\nmaybe, straight towards death by starvation and thirst, he was as\nunconcerned as if he were taking the children for a summer’s sail. His\nimagination dealt little with the future; almost entirely influenced by\nhis immediate surroundings, it could conjure up no fears from the scene\nnow before it. The children were the same.\n\nNever was there a happier starting, more joy in a little boat. During\nbreakfast the seaman had given his charges to understand that if Dick\ndid not meet his father and Emmeline her uncle in a “while or two,” it\nwas because he had gone on board a ship, and he’d be along presently.\nThe terror of their position was as deeply veiled from them as eternity\nis veiled from you or me.\n\nThe Pacific was still bound by one of those glacial calms that can only\noccur when the sea has been free from storms for a vast extent of its\nsurface, for a hurricane down by the Horn will send its swell and\ndisturbance beyond the Marquesas. De Bois in his table of amplitudes\npoints out that more than half the sea disturbances at any given space\nare caused, not by the wind, but by storms at a great distance.\n\nBut the sleep of the Pacific is only apparent. This placid lake, over\nwhich the dinghy was pursuing the running ripple, was heaving to an\nimperceptible swell and breaking on the shores of the Low Archipelago,\nand the Marquesas in foam and thunder.\n\nEmmeline’s rag-doll was a shocking affair from a hygienic or artistic\nstandpoint. Its face was just inked on, it had no features, no arms;\nyet not for all the dolls in the world would she have exchanged this\nfilthy and nearly formless thing. It was a fetish.\n\nShe sat nursing it on one side of the helmsman, whilst Dick, on the\nother side, hung his nose over the water, on the look-out for fish.\n\n“Why do you smoke, Mr Button?” asked Emmeline, who had been watching\nher friend for some time in silence.\n\n“To aise me thrubbles,” replied Paddy.\n\nHe was leaning back with one eye shut and the other fixed on the luff\nof the sail. He was in his element: nothing to do but steer and smoke,\nwarmed by the sun and cooled by the breeze. A landsman would have been\nhalf demented in his condition, many a sailor would have been taciturn\nand surly, on the look-out for sails, and alternately damning his soul\nand praying to his God. Paddy smoked.\n\n“Whoop!” cried Dick. “Look, Paddy!”\n\nAn albicore a few cables lengths to port had taken a flying leap from\nthe flashing sea, turned a complete somersault and vanished.\n\n“It’s an albicore takin’ a buck lep. Hundreds I’ve seen before this;\nhe’s bein’ chased.”\n\n“What’s chasing him, Paddy?”\n\n“What’s chasin’ him?—why, what else but the gibly-gobly-ums!”\n\nBefore Dick could enquire as to the personal appearance and habits of\nthe latter, a shoal of silver arrow heads passed the boat and flittered\ninto the water with a hissing sound.\n\n“Thim’s flyin’ fish. What are you sayin’—fish can’t fly! Where’s the\neyes in your head?”\n\n“Are the gibblyums chasing them too?” asked Emmeline fearfully.\n\n“No; ’tis the Billy balloos that’s afther thim. Don’t be axin’ me any\nmore questions now, or I’ll be tellin’ you lies in a minit.”\n\nEmmeline, it will be remembered, had brought a small parcel with her\ndone up in a little shawl; it was under the boat seat, and every now\nand then she would stoop down to see if it were safe.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nSTORY OF THE PIG AND THE BILLY-GOAT\n\nEvery hour or so Mr Button would shake his lethargy off, and rise and\nlook round for “sea-gulls,” but the prospect was sail-less as the\nprehistoric sea, wingless, voiceless. When Dick would fret now and\nthen, the old sailor would always devise some means of amusing him. He\nmade him fishing-tackle out of a bent pin and some small twine that\nhappened to be in the boat, and told him to fish for “pinkeens”; and\nDick, with the pathetic faith of childhood, fished.\n\nThen he told them things. He had spent a year at Deal long ago, where a\ncousin of his was married to a boatman.\n\nMr Button had put in a year as a longshoreman at Deal, and he had got a\ngreat lot to tell of his cousin and her husband, and more especially of\none, Hannah; Hannah was his cousin’s baby—a most marvellous child, who\nwas born with its “buck” teeth fully developed, and whose first\nunnatural act on entering the world was to make a snap at the\n“docther.” “Hung on to his fist like a bull-dog, and him bawlin’\n‘Murther!’”\n\n“Mrs James,” said Emmeline, referring to a Boston acquaintance, “had a\nlittle baby, and it was pink.”\n\n“Ay, ay,” said Paddy; “they’re mostly pink to start with, but they fade\nwhin they’re washed.”\n\n“It’d no teeth,” said Emmeline, “for I put my finger in to see.”\n\n“The doctor brought it in a bag,” put in Dick, who was still steadily\nfishing—“dug it out of a cabbage patch; an’ I got a trow’l and dug all\nour cabbage patch up, but there weren’t any babies—but there were no\nend of worms.”\n\n“I wish I had a baby,” said Emmeline, “and _I_ wouldn’t send it back to\nthe cabbage patch.”\n\n“The doctor,” explained Dick, “took it back and planted it again; and\nMrs James cried when I asked her, and daddy said it was put back to\ngrow and turn into an angel.”\n\n“Angels have wings,” said Emmeline dreamily.\n\n“And,” pursued Dick, “I told cook, and she said to Jane, daddy\nwas always stuffing children up with—something or ’nother. And I asked\ndaddy to let me see him stuffing up a child—and daddy said cook’d have\nto go away for saying that, and she went away next day.”\n\n“She had three big trunks and a box for her bonnet,” said Emmeline,\nwith a far-away look as she recalled the incident.\n\n“And the cabman asked her hadn’t she any more trunks to put on his cab,\nand hadn’t she forgot the parrot cage,” said Dick.\n\n“I wish _I_ had a parrot in a cage,” murmured Emmeline, moving slightly\nso as to get more in the shadow of the sail.\n\n“And what in the world would you be doin’ with a par’t in a cage?”\nasked Mr Button.\n\n“I’d let it out,” replied Emmeline.\n\n“Spakin’ about lettin’ par’ts out of cages, I remimber me grandfather\nhad an ould pig,” said Paddy (they were all talking seriously together\nlike equals). “I was a spalpeen no bigger than the height of me knee,\nand I’d go to the sty door, and he’d come to the door, and grunt an’\nblow wid his nose undher it; an’ I’d grunt back to vex him, an’ hammer\nwid me fist on it, an’ shout ‘Halloo there! halloo there!’ and ‘Halloo\nto you!’ he’d say, spakin’ the pigs’ language. ‘Let me out,’ he’d say,\n‘and I’ll give yiz a silver shilling.’\n\n“‘Pass it under the door,’ I’d answer him. Thin he’d stick the snout of\nhim undher the door an’ I’d hit it a clip with a stick, and he’d yell\nmurther Irish. An’ me mother’d come out an’ baste me, an’ well I\ndesarved it.\n\n“Well, wan day I opened the sty door, an’ out he boulted and away and\nbeyant, over hill and hollo he goes till he gets to the edge of the\ncliff overlookin’ the say, and there he meets a billy-goat, and he and\nthe billy-goat has a division of opinion.\n\n“‘Away wid yiz!’ says the billy-goat.\n\n“‘Away wid yourself!’ says he.\n\n“‘Whose you talkin’ to?’ says t’other.\n\n“‘Yourself,’ says him.\n\n“‘Who stole the eggs?’ says the billy-goat.\n\n“‘Ax your ould grandmother!’ says the pig.\n\n“‘Ax me ould _which_ mother?’ says the billy-goat.\n\n“‘Oh, ax me——’ And before he could complete the sintence ram, blam,\nthe ould billy-goat butts him in the chist, and away goes the both of\nthim whirtlin’ into the say below.\n\n“Thin me ould grandfather comes out, and collars me by the scruff, and\n‘Into the sty with you!’ says he; and into the sty I wint, and there\nthey kep’ me for a fortni’t on bran mash and skim milk—and well I\ndesarved it.”\n\nThey dined somewhere about eleven o’clock, and at noon Paddy unstepped\nthe mast and made a sort of little tent or awning with the sail in the\nbow of the boat to protect the children from the rays of the vertical\nsun.\n\nThen he took his place in the bottom of the boat, in the stern, stuck\nDick’s straw hat over his face to preserve it from the sun, kicked\nabout a bit to get a comfortable position, and fell asleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n“S-H-E-N-A-N-D-O-A-H”\n\nHe had slept an hour and more when he was brought to his senses by a\nthin and prolonged shriek. It was Emmeline in a nightmare, or more\nproperly a day-mare, brought on by a meal of sardines and the haunting\nmemory of the gibbly-gobbly-ums. When she was shaken (it always took a\nconsiderable time to bring her to, from these seizures) and comforted,\nthe mast was restepped.\n\nAs Mr Button stood with his hand on the spar looking round him before\ngoing aft with the sheet, an object struck his eye some three miles\nahead. Objects rather, for they were the masts and spars of a small\nship rising from the water. Not a vestige of sail, just the naked\nspars. It might have been a couple of old skeleton trees jutting out of\nthe water for all a landsman could have told.\n\nHe stared at this sight for twenty or thirty seconds without speaking,\nhis head projected like the head of a tortoise. Then he gave a wild\n“Hurroo!”\n\n“What is it, Paddy?” asked Dick.\n\n“Hurroo!” replied Mr Button. “Ship ahoy! ship ahoy! Lie to till I be\nafther boardin’ you. Sure, they are lyin’ to—divil a rag of canvas on\nher—are they aslape or dhramin’? Here, Dick, let me get aft wid the\nsheet; the wind’ll take us up to her quicker than we’ll row.”\n\nHe crawled aft and took the tiller; the breeze took the sail, and the\nboat forged ahead.\n\n“Is it daddy’s ship?” asked Dick, who was almost as excited as his\nfriend.\n\n“I dinno; we’ll see when we fetch her.”\n\n“Shall we go on her, Mr Button?” asked Emmeline.\n\n“Ay will we, honey.”\n\nEmmeline bent down, and fetching her parcel from under the seat, held\nit in her lap.\n\nAs they drew nearer, the outlines of the ship became more apparent. She\nwas a small brig, with stump topmasts, from the spars a few rags of\ncanvas fluttered. It was apparent soon to the old sailor’s eye what was\namiss with her.\n\n“She’s derelick, bad cess to her!” he muttered; “derelick and done\nfor—just me luck!”\n\n“I can’t see any people on the ship,” cried Dick, who had crept\nforward to the bow. “Daddy’s not there.”\n\nThe old sailor let the boat off a point or two, so as to get a view of\nthe brig more fully; when they were within twenty cable lengths or so\nhe unstepped the mast and took to the sculls.\n\nThe little brig floated very low on the water, and presented a mournful\nenough appearance; her running rigging all slack, shreds of canvas\nflapping at the yards, and no boats hanging at her davits. It was easy\nenough to see that she was a timber ship, and that she had started a\nbutt, flooded herself and been abandoned.\n\nPaddy lay on his oars within a few strokes of her. She was floating as\nplacidly as though she were in the harbour of San Francisco; the green\nwater showed in her shadow, and in the green water waved the tropic\nweeds that were growing from her copper. Her paint was blistered and\nburnt absolutely as though a hot iron had been passed over it, and over\nher taffrail hung a large rope whose end was lost to sight in the water.\n\nA few strokes brought them under the stern. The name of the ship was\nthere in faded letters, also the port to which she belonged.\n“_Shenandoah_. Martha’s Vineyard.”\n\n“There’s letters on her,” said Mr Button. “But I can’t make thim out.\nI’ve no larnin’.”\n\n“I can read them,” said Dick.\n\n“So c’n I,” murmured Emmeline.\n\n“S-H-E-N-A-N-D-O-A-H,” spelt Dick.\n\n“What’s that?” enquired Paddy.\n\n“I don’t know,” replied Dick, rather downcastedly.\n\n“There you are!” cried the oarsman in a disgusted manner, pulling the\nboat round to the starboard side of the brig. “They pritind to tache\nletters to childer in schools, pickin’ their eyes out wid book-readin’,\nand here’s letters as big as me face an’ they can’t make hid or tail of\nthem—be dashed to book-readin’!”\n\nThe brig had old-fashioned wide channels, regular platforms; and she\nfloated so low in the water that they were scarcely a foot above the\nlevel of the dinghy.\n\nMr Button secured the boat by passing the painter through a channel\nplate, then, with Emmeline and her parcel in his arms or rather in one\narm, he clambered over the channel and passed her over the rail on to\nthe deck. Then it was Dick’s turn, and the children stood waiting\nwhilst the old sailor brought the beaker of water, the biscuit, and the\ntinned stuff on board.\n\nIt was a place to delight the heart of a boy, the deck of the\n_Shenandoah_; forward right from the main hatchway it was laden with\ntimber. Running rigging lay loose on the deck in coils, and nearly the\nwhole of the quarter-deck was occupied by a deck-house. The place had a\ndelightful smell of sea-beach, decaying wood, tar, and mystery. Bights\nof buntline and other ropes were dangling from above, only waiting to\nbe swung from. A bell was hung just forward of the foremast. In half a\nmoment Dick was forward hammering at the bell with a belaying pin he\nhad picked from the deck.\n\nMr Button shouted to him to desist; the sound of the bell jarred on his\nnerves. It sounded like a summons, and a summons on that deserted craft\nwas quite out of place. Who knew what mightn’t answer it in the way of\nthe supernatural?\n\nDick dropped the belaying pin and ran forward. He took the disengaged\nhand, and the three went aft to the door of the deck-house. The door\nwas open, and they peeped in.\n\nThe place had three windows on the starboard side, and through the\nwindows the sun was shining in a mournful manner. There was a table in\nthe middle of the place. A seat was pushed away from the table as if\nsome one had risen in a hurry. On the table lay the remains of a meal, a\nteapot, two teacups, two plates. On one of the plates rested a fork\nwith a bit of putrifying bacon upon it that some one had evidently been\nconveying to his mouth when—something had happened. Near the teapot\nstood a tin of condensed milk, haggled open. Some old salt had just\nbeen in the act of putting milk in his tea when the mysterious\nsomething had occurred. Never did a lot of dead things speak so\neloquently as these things spoke.\n\nOne could conjure it all up. The skipper, most likely, had finished his\ntea, and the mate was hard at work at his, when the leak had been\ndiscovered, or some derelict had been run into, or whatever it was had\nhappened—happened.\n\nOne thing was evident, that since the abandonment of the brig she had\nexperienced fine weather, else the things would not have been left\nstanding so trimly on the table.\n\nMr Button and Dick entered the place to prosecute enquiries, but\nEmmeline remained at the door. The charm of the old brig appealed to\nher almost as much as to Dick, but she had a feeling about it quite\nunknown to him. A ship where no one was had about it suggestions of\n“other things.”\n\nShe was afraid to enter the gloomy deck-house, and afraid to remain\nalone outside; she compromised matters by sitting down on the deck.\nThen she placed the small bundle beside her, and hurriedly took the\nrag-doll from her pocket, into which it was stuffed head down, pulled\nits calico skirt from over its head, propped it up against the coaming\nof the door, and told it not to be afraid.\n\nThere was not much to be found in the deck-house, but aft of it were\ntwo small cabins like rabbit hutches, once inhabited by the skipper and\nhis mate. Here there were great findings in the way of rubbish. Old\nclothes, old boots, an old top-hat of that extraordinary pattern you\nmay see in the streets of Pernambuco, immensely tall, and narrowing\ntowards the brim. A telescope without a lens, a volume of Hoyt, a\nnautical almanac, a great bolt of striped flannel shirting, a box of\nfish hooks. And in one corner—glorious find!—a coil of what seemed to\nbe ten yards or so of black rope.\n\n“Baccy, begorra!” shouted Pat, seizing upon his treasure. It was\npigtail. You may see coils of it in the tobacconists’ windows of\nseaport towns. A pipe full of it would make a hippopotamus vomit, yet\nold sailors chew it and smoke it and revel in it.\n\n“We’ll bring all the lot of the things out on deck, and see what’s\nworth keepin’ an’ what’s worth leavin’,” said Mr Button, taking an\nimmense armful of the old truck; whilst Dick, carrying the top-hat,\nupon which he had instantly seized as his own special booty, led the\nway.\n\n“Em,” shouted Dick, as he emerged from the doorway, “see what I’ve got!”\n\nHe popped the awful-looking structure over his head. It went right down\nto his shoulders.\n\nEmmeline gave a shriek.\n\n“It smells funny,” said Dick, taking it off and applying his nose to\nthe inside of it—“smells like an old hair brush. Here, you try it on.”\n\nEmmeline scrambled away as far as she could, till she reached the\nstarboard bulwarks, where she sat in the scupper, breathless and\nspeechless and wide-eyed. She was always dumb when frightened (unless\nit were a nightmare or a very sudden shock), and this hat suddenly seen\nhalf covering Dick frightened her out of her wits. Besides, it was a\nblack thing, and she hated black things—black cats, black horses;\nworst of all, black dogs.\n\nShe had once seen a hearse in the streets of Boston, an old-time hearse\nwith black plumes, trappings and all complete. The sight had nearly\ngiven her a fit, though she did not know in the least the meaning of it.\n\nMeanwhile Mr Button was conveying armful after armful of stuff on deck.\nWhen the heap was complete, he sat down beside it in the glorious\nafternoon sunshine, and lit his pipe.\n\nHe had searched neither for food or water as yet; content with the\ntreasure God had given him, for the moment the material things of life\nwere forgotten. And, indeed, if he had searched he would have found\nonly half a sack of potatoes in the caboose, for the lazarette was\nawash, and the water in the scuttle-butt was stinking.\n\nEmmeline, seeing what was in progress, crept up, Dick promising not to\nput the hat on her, and they all sat round the pile.\n\n“Thim pair of brogues,” said the old man, holding a pair of old boots\nup for inspection like an auctioneer, “would fetch half a dollar any\nday in the wake in any sayport in the world. Put them beside you, Dick,\nand lay hold of this pair of britches by the ends of em’—stritch them.”\n\nThe trousers were stretched out, examined and approved of, and laid\nbeside the boots.\n\n“Here’s a tiliscope wid wan eye shut,” said Mr Button, examining the\nbroken telescope and pulling it in and out like a concertina. “Stick\nit beside the brogues; it may come in handy for somethin’. Here’s a\nbook”—tossing the nautical almanac to the boy. “Tell me what it says.”\n\nDick examined the pages of figures hopelessly.\n\n“I can’t read ’em,” said Dick; “it’s numbers.”\n\n“Buzz it overboard,” said Mr Button.\n\nDick did what he was told joyfully, and the proceedings resumed.\n\nHe tried on the tall hat, and the children laughed. On her old friend’s\nhead the thing ceased to have terror for Emmeline.\n\nShe had two methods of laughing. The angelic smile before mentioned—a\nrare thing—and, almost as rare, a laugh in which she showed her little\nwhite teeth, whilst she pressed her hands together, the left one tight\nshut, and the right clasped over it.\n\nHe put the hat on one side, and continued the sorting, searching all\nthe pockets of the clothes and finding nothing. When he had arranged\nwhat to keep, they flung the rest overboard, and the valuables were\nconveyed to the captain’s cabin, there to remain till wanted.\n\nThen the idea that food might turn up useful as well as old clothes in\ntheir present condition struck the imaginative mind of Mr Button, and\nhe proceeded to search.\n\nThe lazarette was simply a cistern full of sea water; what else it\nmight contain, not being a diver, he could not say. In the copper of\nthe caboose lay a great lump of putrifying pork or meat of some sort.\nThe harness cask contained nothing except huge crystals of salt. All\nthe meat had been taken away. Still, the provisions and water brought\non board from the dinghy would be sufficient to last them some ten days\nor so, and in the course of ten days a lot of things might happen.\n\nMr Button leaned over the side. The dinghy was nestling beside the brig\nlike a duckling beside a duck; the broad channel might have been\nlikened to the duck’s wing half extended. He got on the channel to see\nif the painter was safely attached. Having made all secure, he climbed\nslowly up to the main-yard arm, and looked round upon the sea.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nSHADOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT\n\n“Daddy’s a long time coming,” said Dick all of a sudden.\n\nThey were seated on the baulks of timber that cumbered the deck of the\nbrig on either side of the caboose. An ideal perch. The sun was setting\nover Australia way, in a sea that seemed like a sea of boiling gold.\nSome mystery of mirage caused the water to heave and tremble as if\ntroubled by fervent heat.\n\n“Ay, is he,” said Mr Button; “but it’s better late than never. Now\ndon’t be thinkin’ of him, for that won’t bring him. Look at the sun\ngoin’ into the wather, and don’t be spakin’ a word, now, but listen and\nyou’ll hear it hiss.”\n\nThe children gazed and listened, Paddy also. All three were mute as the\ngreat blazing shield touched the water that leapt to meet it.\n\nYou _could_ hear the water hiss—if you had imagination enough. Once\nhaving touched the water, the sun went down behind it, as swiftly as a\nman in a hurry going down a ladder. As he vanished a ghostly and golden\ntwilight spread over the sea, a light exquisite but immensely forlorn.\nThen the sea became a violet shadow, the west darkened as if to a\nclosing door, and the stars rushed over the sky.\n\n“Mr Button,” said Emmeline, nodding towards the sun as he vanished,\n“where’s over there?”\n\n“The west,” replied he, staring at the sunset. “Chainy and Injee and\nall away beyant.”\n\n“Where’s the sun gone to now, Paddy?” asked Dick.\n\n“He’s gone chasin’ the moon, an’ she’s skedadlin’ wid her dress brailed\nup for all she’s worth; she’ll be along up in a minit. He’s always\nafther her, but he’s never caught her yet.”\n\n“What would he do to her if he caught her?” asked Emmeline.\n\n“Faith, an’ maybe he’d fetch her a skelp—an’ well she’d desarve it.”\n\n“Why’d she deserve it?” asked Dick, who was in one of his questioning\nmoods.\n\n“Because she’s always delutherin’ people an’ leadin’ thim asthray.\nGirls or men, she moidhers thim all once she gets the comeither on\nthem; same as she did Buck M’Cann.”\n\n“Who’s he?”\n\n“Buck M’Cann? Faith, he was the village ijit where I used to live in\nthe ould days.”\n\n“What’s that?”\n\n“Hould your whisht, an’ don’t be axin’ questions. He was always wantin’\nthe moon, though he was twinty an’ six feet four. He’d a gob on him\nthat hung open like a rat-trap with a broken spring, and he was as thin\nas a barber’s pole, you could a’ tied a reef knot in the middle of ’um;\nand whin the moon was full there was no houldin’ him.” Mr Button gazed\nat the reflection of the sunset on the water for a moment as if\nrecalling some form from the past, and then proceeded. “He’d sit on the\ngrass starin’ at her, an’ thin he’d start to chase her over the hills,\nand they’d find him at last, maybe a day or two later, lost in the\nmountains, grazin’ on berries, an’ as green as a cabbidge from the\nhunger an’ the cowld, till it got so bad at long last they had to\nhobble him.”\n\n“I’ve seen a donkey hobbled,” cried Dick.\n\n“Thin you’ve seen the twin brother of Buck M’Cann. Well, one night me\nelder brother Tim was sittin’ over the fire, smokin’ his dudeen an’\nthinkin’ of his sins, when in comes Buck with the hobbles on him.\n\n“‘Tim,’ says he, ‘I’ve got her at last!’\n\n“‘Got who?’ says Tim.\n\n“‘The moon,’ says he.\n\n“‘Got her where?’ says Tim.\n\n“‘In a bucket down by the pond,’ says t’other, ‘safe an’ sound an’ not\na scratch on her; you come and look,’ says he. So Tim follows him, he\nhobblin’, and they goes to the pond side, and there, sure enough, stood\na tin bucket full of wather, an’ on the wather the refliction of the\nmoon.\n\n“‘I dridged her out of the pond,’ whispers Buck. ‘Aisy now,’ says he,\n‘an’ I’ll dribble the water out gently,’ says he, ‘an’ we’ll catch her\nalive at the bottom of it like a trout.’ So he drains the wather out\ngently of the bucket till it was near all gone, an’ then he looks into\nthe bucket expectin’ to find the moon flounderin’ in the bottom of it\nlike a flat fish.\n\n“‘She’s gone, bad ’cess to her!’ says he.\n\n“‘Try again,’ says me brother, and Buck fills the bucket again, and\nthere was the moon sure enough when the water came to stand still.\n\n“‘Go on,’ says me brother. ‘Drain out the wather, but go gentle, or\nshe’ll give yiz the slip again.’\n\n“‘Wan minit,’ says Buck, ‘I’ve got an idea,’ says he; ‘she won’t give\nme the slip this time,’ says he. ‘You wait for me,’ says he; and off he\nhobbles to his old mother’s cabin a stone’s-throw away, and back he\ncomes with a sieve.\n\n“‘You hold the sieve,’ says Buck, ‘and I’ll drain the water into it; if\nshe ’scapes from the bucket we’ll have her in the sieve.’ And he pours\nthe wather out of the bucket as gentle as if it was crame out of a jug.\nWhen all the wather was out he turns the bucket bottom up, and shook it.\n\n“‘Ran dan the thing!’ he cries, ‘she’s gone again;’ an’ wid that he\nflings the bucket into the pond, and the sieve afther the bucket, when\nup comes his old mother hobbling on her stick.\n\n“‘Where’s me bucket?’ says she.\n\n“‘In the pond,’ say Buck.\n\n“‘And me sieve?’ says she.\n\n“‘Gone afther the bucket.’\n\n“‘I’ll give yiz a bucketin’!’ says she; and she up with the stick and\nlanded him a skelp, an’ driv him roarin’ and hobblin’ before her, and\nlocked him up in the cabin, an’ kep’ him on bread an’ wather for a wake\nto get the moon out of his head; but she might have saved her thruble,\nfor that day month in it was agin—— There she comes!”\n\nThe moon, argent and splendid, was breaking from the water. She was\nfull, and her light was powerful almost as the light of day. The\nshadows of the children and the queer shadow of Mr Button were cast on\nthe wall of the caboose hard and black as silhouettes.\n\n“Look at our shadows!” cried Dick, taking off his broad-brimmed straw\nhat and waving it.\n\nEmmeline held up her doll to see _its_ shadow, and Mr Button held up his\npipe.\n\n“Come now,” said he, putting the pipe back in his mouth, and making to\nrise, “and shadda off to bed; it’s time you were aslape, the both of\nyou.”\n\nDick began to yowl.\n\n“_I_ don’t want to go to bed; I aint tired, Paddy—les’s stay a little\nlonger.”\n\n“Not a minit,” said the other, with all the decision of a nurse; “not a\nminit afther me pipe’s out!”\n\n“Fill it again,” said Dick.\n\nMr Button made no reply. The pipe gurgled as he puffed at it—a kind of\ndeath-rattle speaking of almost immediate extinction.\n\n“Mr Button!” said Emmeline. She was holding her nose in the air and\nsniffing; seated to windward of the smoker, and out of the\npigtail-poisoned air, her delicate sense of smell perceived something\nlost to the others.\n\n“What is it, acushla?”\n\n“I smell something.”\n\n“What d’ye say you smell?”\n\n“Something nice.”\n\n“What’s it like?” asked Dick, sniffing hard. “_I_ don’t smell anything.”\n\nEmmeline sniffed again to make sure.\n\n“Flowers,” said she.\n\nThe breeze, which had shifted several points since midday, was bearing\nwith it a faint, faint odour: a perfume of vanilla and spice so faint\nas to be imperceptible to all but the most acute olfactory sense.\n\n“Flowers!” said the old sailor, tapping the ashes out of his pipe\nagainst the heel of his boot. “And where’d you get flowers in middle of\nthe say? It’s dhramin’ you are. Come now—to bed wid yiz!”\n\n“Fill it again,” wailed Dick, referring to the pipe.\n\n“It’s a spankin’ I’ll give you,” replied his guardian, lifting him down\nfrom the timber baulks, and then assisting Emmeline, “in two ticks if\nyou don’t behave. Come along, Em’line.”\n\nHe started aft, a small hand in each of his, Dick bellowing.\n\nAs they passed the ship’s bell, Dick stretched towards the belaying pin\nthat was still lying on the deck, seized it, and hit the bell a mighty\nbang. It was the last pleasure to be snatched before sleep, and he\nsnatched it.\n\nPaddy had made up beds for himself and his charges in the deck-house;\nhe had cleared the stuff off the table, broken open the windows to get\nthe musty smell away, and placed the mattresses from the captain and\nmate’s cabins on the floor.\n\nWhen the children were in bed and asleep, he went to the starboard\nrail, and, leaning on it, looked over the moonlit sea. He was thinking\nof ships as his wandering eye roved over the sea spaces, little\ndreaming of the message that the perfumed breeze was bearing him. The\nmessage that had been received and dimly understood by Emmeline. Then\nhe leaned with his back to the rail and his hands in his pockets. He\nwas not thinking now, he was ruminating.\n\nThe basis of the Irish character as exemplified by Paddy Button is a\nprofound laziness mixed with a profound melancholy. Yet Paddy, in his\nleft-handed way, was as hard a worker as any man on board ship; and as\nfor melancholy, he was the life and soul of the fo’cs’le. Yet there\nthey were, the laziness and the melancholy, only waiting to be tapped.\n\nAs he stood with his hands thrust deep in his pockets, longshore\nfashion, counting the dowels in the planking of the deck by the\nmoonlight, he was reviewing the “old days.” The tale of Buck M’Cann had\nrecalled them, and across all the salt seas he could see the moonlight\non the Connemara mountains, and hear the sea-gulls crying on the\nthunderous beach where each wave has behind it three thousand miles of\nsea.\n\nSuddenly Mr Button came back from the mountains of Connemara to find\nhimself on the deck of the _Shenandoah_; and he instantly became\npossessed by fears. Beyond the white deserted deck, barred by the\nshadows of the standing rigging, he could see the door of the caboose.\nSuppose he should suddenly see a head pop out—or, worse, a shadowy form\ngo in?\n\nHe turned to the deck-house, where the children were sound asleep, and\nwhere, in a few minutes, he, too, was sound asleep beside them, whilst\nall night long the brig rocked to the gentle swell of the Pacific, and\nthe breeze blew, bringing with it the perfume of flowers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE TRAGEDY OF THE BOATS\n\nWhen the fog lifted after midnight the people in the long-boat saw the\nquarter-boat half a mile to starboard of them.\n\n“Can you see the dinghy?” asked Lestrange of the captain, who was\nstanding up searching the horizon.\n\n“Not a speck,” answered Le Farge. “Damn that Irishman! but for him I’d\nhave got the boats away properly victualled and all; as it is I don’t\nknow what we’ve got aboard. You, Jenkins, what have you got forward\nthere?”\n\n“Two bags of bread and a breaker of water,” answered the steward.\n\n“A breaker of water be sugared!” came another voice; “a breaker half\nfull, you mean.”\n\nThen the steward’s voice: “So it is; there’s not more than a couple of\ngallons in her.”\n\n“My God!” said Le Farge. “_Damn_ that Irishman!”\n\n“There’s not more than’ll give us two half pannikins apiece all round,”\nsaid the steward.\n\n“Maybe,” said Le Farge, “the quarter-boat’s better stocked; pull for\nher.”\n\n“She’s pulling for us,” said the stroke oar.\n\n“Captain,” asked Lestrange, “are you sure there’s no sight of the\ndinghy?”\n\n“None,” replied Le Farge.\n\nThe unfortunate man’s head sank on his breast. He had little time to\nbrood over his troubles, however, for a tragedy was beginning to unfold\naround him, the most shocking, perhaps, in the annals of the sea—a\ntragedy to be hinted at rather than spoken of.\n\nWhen the boats were within hailing distance, a man in the bow of the\nlong-boat rose up.\n\n“Quarter-boat ahoy!”\n\n“Ahoy!”\n\n“How much water have you?”\n\n“None!”\n\nThe word came floating over the placid moonlit water. At it the fellows\nin the long-boat ceased rowing, and you could see the water-drops\ndripping off their oars like diamonds in the moonlight.\n\n“Quarter-boat ahoy!” shouted the fellow in the bow. “Lay on your oars.”\n\n“Here, you scowbanker!” cried Le Farge, “who are you to be giving\ndirections—”\n\n“Scowbanker yourself!” replied the fellow. “Bullies, put her about!”\n\nThe starboard oars backed water, and the boat came round.\n\nBy chance the worst lot of the _Northumberland’s_ crew were in the\nlong-boat—veritable “scowbankers,” scum; and how scum clings to life\nyou will never know, until you have been amongst it in an open boat at\nsea. Le Farge had no more command over this lot than you have who are\nreading this book.\n\n“Heave to!” came from the quarter-boat, as she laboured behind.\n\n“Lay on your oars, bullies!” cried the ruffian at the bow, who was\nstill standing up like an evil genius who had taken momentary command\nover events. “Lay on your oars, bullies; they’d better have it now.”\n\nThe quarter-boat in her turn ceased rowing, and lay a cable’s length\naway.\n\n“How much water have you?” came the mate’s voice.\n\n“Not enough to go round.”\n\nLe Farge made to rise, and the stroke oar struck at him, catching him\nin the wind and doubling him up in the bottom of the boat.\n\n“Give us some, for God’s sake!” came the mate’s voice; “we’re parched\nwith rowing, and there’s a woman on board.”\n\nThe fellow in the bow of the long-boat, as if some one had suddenly\nstruck him, broke into a tornado of blasphemy.\n\n“Give us some,” came the mate’s voice, “or, by God, we’ll lay you\naboard!”\n\nBefore the words were well spoken the men in the quarter-boat carried\nthe threat into action. The conflict was brief: the quarter-boat was\ntoo crowded for fighting. The starboard men in the long-boat fought\nwith their oars, whilst the fellows to port steadied the boat.\n\nThe fight did not last long, and presently the quarter-boat sheered\noff, half of the men in her cut about the head and bleeding—two of\nthem senseless.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\nIt was sundown on the following day. The long-boat lay adrift. The last\ndrop of water had been served out eight hours before.\n\nThe quarter-boat, like a horrible phantom, had been haunting and\npursuing her all day, begging for water when there was none. It was\nlike the prayers one might expect to hear in hell.\n\nThe men in the long-boat, gloomy and morose, weighed down with a sense\nof crime, tortured by thirst, and tormented by the voices imploring for\nwater, lay on their oars when the other boat tried to approach.\n\nNow and then, suddenly, and as if moved by a common impulse, they would\nall shout out together: “We have none.” But the quarter-boat would not\nbelieve. It was in vain to hold the breaker with the bung out to prove\nits dryness, the half-delirious creatures had it fixed in their minds\nthat their comrades were withholding from them the water that was not.\n\nJust as the sun touched the sea, Lestrange, rousing himself from a\ntorpor into which he had sunk, raised himself and looked over the\ngunwale. He saw the quarter-boat drifting a cable’s length away, lit by\nthe full light of sunset, and the spectres in it, seeing him, held out\nin mute appeal their blackened tongues.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\nOf the night that followed it is almost impossible to speak. Thirst\nwas nothing to what the scowbankers suffered from the torture of the\nwhimpering appeal for water that came to them at intervals during the\nnight.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\nWhen at last the _Arago_, a French whale ship, sighted them, the crew of\nthe long-boat were still alive, but three of them were raving madmen.\nOf the crew of the quarter-boat was saved—not one.\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE ISLAND\n\n“Childer!” shouted Paddy. He was at the cross-trees in the full dawn,\nwhilst the children standing beneath on deck were craning their faces\nup to him. “There’s an island forenint us.”\n\n“Hurrah!” cried Dick. He was not quite sure what an island might be\nlike in the concrete, but it was something fresh, and Paddy’s voice was\njubilant.\n\n“Land ho! it is,” said he, coming down to the deck. “Come for’ard to\nthe bows, and I’ll show it you.”\n\nHe stood on the timber in the bows and lifted Emmeline up in his arms;\nand even at that humble elevation from the water she could see\nsomething of an undecided colour—green for choice—on the horizon.\n\nIt was not directly ahead, but on the starboard bow—or, as she would\nhave expressed it, to the right. When Dick had looked and expressed his\ndisappointment at there being so little to see, Paddy began to make\npreparations for leaving the ship.\n\nIt was only just now, with land in sight, that he recognised in some\nfashion the horror of the position from which they were about to escape.\n\nHe fed the children hurriedly with some biscuits and tinned meat, and\nthen, with a biscuit in his hand, eating as he went, he trotted about\nthe decks, collecting things and stowing them in the dinghy. The bolt\nof striped flannel, all the old clothes, a housewife full of needles\nand thread, such as seamen sometimes carry, the half-sack of potatoes,\na saw which he found in the caboose, the precious coil of tobacco, and\na lot of other odds and ends he transhipped, sinking the little dinghy\nseveral strakes in the process. Also, of course, he took the breaker of\nwater, and the remains of the biscuit and tinned stuff they had brought\non board. These being stowed, and the dinghy ready, he went forward\nwith the children to the bow, to see how the island was bearing.\n\nIt had loomed up nearer during the hour or so in which he had been\ncollecting and storing the things—nearer, and more to the right, which\nmeant that the brig was being borne by a fairly swift current, and that\nshe would pass it, leaving it two or three miles to starboard. It was\nwell they had command of the dinghy.\n\n“The sea’s all round it,” said Emmeline, who was seated on Paddy’s\nshoulder, holding on tight to him, and gazing upon the island, the\ngreen of whose trees was now visible, an oasis of verdure in the\nsparkling and seraphic blue.\n\n“Are we going there, Paddy?” asked Dick, holding on to a stay, and\nstraining his eyes towards the land.\n\n“Ay, are we,” said Mr Button. “Hot foot—five knots, if we’re makin’\nwan; and it’s ashore we’ll be by noon, and maybe sooner.”\n\nThe breeze had freshened up, and was blowing dead from the island, as\nthough the island were making a weak attempt to blow them away from it.\n\nOh, what a fresh and perfumed breeze it was! All sorts of tropical\ngrowing things had joined their scent in one bouquet.\n\n“Smell it,” said Emmeline, expanding her small nostrils. “That’s what I\nsmelt last night, only it’s stronger now.”\n\nThe last reckoning taken on board the _Northumberland_ had proved the\nship to be south by east of the Marquesas; this was evidently one of\nthose small, lost islands that lie here and there south by east of the\nMarquesas. Islands the most lonely and beautiful in the world.\n\nAs they gazed it grew before them, and shifted still more to the right.\nIt was hilly and green now, though the trees could not be clearly made\nout; here, the green was lighter in colour, and there, darker. A rim of\npure white marble seemed to surround its base. It was foam breaking on\nthe barrier reef.\n\nIn another hour the feathery foliage of the cocoa-nut palms could be\nmade out, and the old sailor judged it time to take to the boat.\n\nHe lifted Emmeline, who was clasping her luggage, over the rail on to\nthe channel, and deposited her in the stern-sheets; then Dick.\n\nIn a moment the boat was adrift, the mast stepped, and the _Shenandoah_\nleft to pursue her mysterious voyage at the will of the currents of the\nsea.\n\n“You’re not going to the island, Paddy,” cried Dick, as the old man put\nthe boat on the port tack.\n\n“You be aisy,” replied the other, “and don’t be larnin’ your\ngran’mother. How the divil d’ye think I’d fetch the land sailin’ dead\nin the wind’s eye?”\n\n“Has the wind eyes?”\n\nMr Button did not answer the question. He was troubled in his mind.\nWhat if the island were inhabited? He had spent several years in the\nSouth Seas. He knew the people of the Marquesas and Samoa, and liked\nthem. But here he was out of his bearings.\n\nHowever, all the troubling in the world was of no use. It was a case of\nthe island or the deep sea, and, putting the boat on the starboard\ntack, he lit his pipe and leaned back with the tiller in the crook of\nhis arm. His keen eyes had made out from the deck of the brig an\nopening in the reef, and he was making to run the dinghy abreast of the\nopening, and then take to the sculls and row her through.\n\nNow, as they drew nearer a sound came on the breeze, a sound faint and\nsonorous and dreamy. It was the sound of the breakers on the reef. The\nsea just here was heaving to a deeper swell, as if vexed in its sleep\nat the resistance to it of the land.\n\nEmmeline, sitting with her bundle in her lap, stared without speaking\nat the sight before her. Even in the bright, glorious sunshine, and\ndespite the greenery that showed beyond, it was a desolate sight seen\nfrom her place in the dinghy. A white, forlorn beach, over which the\nbreakers raced and tumbled, sea-gulls wheeling and screaming, and over\nall the thunder of the surf.\n\nSuddenly the break became visible, and a glimpse of smooth, blue water\nbeyond. Mr Button unshipped the tiller, unstepped the mast, and took to\nthe sculls.\n\nAs they drew nearer, the sea became more active, savage, and alive; the\nthunder of the surf became louder, the breakers more fierce and\nthreatening, the opening broader.\n\nOne could see the water swirling round the coral piers, for the tide\nwas flooding into the lagoon; it had seized the little dinghy and was\nbearing it along far swifter than the sculls could have driven it.\nSea-gulls screamed around them, the boat rocked and swayed. Dick\nshouted with excitement, and Emmeline shut her eyes _tight_.\n\nThen, as though a door had been swiftly and silently closed, the sound\nof the surf became suddenly less. The boat floated on an even keel; she\nopened her eyes and found herself in Wonderland.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE LAKE OF AZURE\n\nOn either side lay a great sweep of waving blue water. Calm, almost as\na lake, sapphire here, and here with the tints of the aqua marine. Water\nso clear that fathoms away below you could see the branching coral, the\nschools of passing fish, and the shadows of the fish upon the spaces of\nsand.\n\nBefore them the clear water washed the sands of a white beach, the\ncocoa-palms waved and whispered in the breeze; and as the oarsman lay\non his oars to look a flock of bluebirds rose, as if suddenly freed\nfrom the tree-tops, wheeled, and passed soundless, like a wreath of\nsmoke, over the tree-tops of the higher land beyond.\n\n“Look!” shouted Dick, who had his nose over the gunwale of the boat.\n“Look at the _fish_!”\n\n“Mr Button,” cried Emmeline, “where are we?”\n\n“Bedad, I dunno; but we might be in a worse place, I’m thinkin’,”\nreplied the old man, sweeping his eyes over the blue and tranquil\nlagoon, from the barrier reef to the happy shore.\n\nOn either side of the broad beach before them the cocoa-nut trees came\ndown like two regiments, and bending gazed at their own reflections in\nthe lagoon. Beyond lay waving chapparel, where cocoa-palms and\nbreadfruit trees intermixed with the mammee apple and the tendrils of\nthe wild vine. On one of the piers of coral at the break of the reef\nstood a single cocoa-palm; bending with a slight curve, it, too, seemed\nseeking its reflection in the waving water.\n\nBut the soul of it all, the indescribable thing about this picture of\nmirrored palm trees, blue lagoon, coral reef and sky, was the light.\n\nAway at sea the light was blinding, dazzling, cruel. Away at sea it had\nnothing to focus itself upon, nothing to exhibit but infinite spaces of\nblue water and desolation.\n\nHere it made the air a crystal, through which the gazer saw the\nloveliness of the land and reef, the green of palm, the white of coral,\nthe wheeling gulls, the blue lagoon, all sharply outlined—burning,\ncoloured, arrogant, yet tender—heart-breakingly beautiful, for the\nspirit of eternal morning was here, eternal happiness, eternal youth.\n\nAs the oarsman pulled the tiny craft towards the beach, neither he nor\nthe children saw away behind the boat, on the water near the bending\npalm tree at the break in the reef, something that for a moment\ninsulted the day, and was gone. Something like a small triangle of dark\ncanvas, that rippled through the water and sank from sight; something\nthat appeared and vanished like an evil thought.\n\nIt did not take long to beach the boat. Mr Button tumbled over the side\nup to his knees in water, whilst Dick crawled over the bow.\n\n“Catch hould of her the same as I do,” cried Paddy, laying hold of the\nstarboard gunwale; whilst Dick, imitative as a monkey, seized the\ngunwale to port. Now then:\n\n  “‘Yeo ho, Chilliman,\n  Up wid her, up wid her,\n  Heave O, Chilliman.’\n\n“Lave her be now; she’s high enough.”\n\nHe took Emmeline in his arms and carried her up on the sand. It was\nfrom just here on the sand that you could see the true beauty of the\nlagoon. That lake of sea water forever protected from storm and trouble\nby the barrier reef of coral.\n\nRight from where the little clear ripples ran up the strand, it led the\neye to the break in the coral reef where the palm gazed at its own\nreflection in the water, and there, beyond the break, one caught a\nvision of the great heaving, sparkling sea.\n\nThe lagoon, just here, was perhaps more than a third of a mile broad. I\nhave never measured it, but I know that, standing by the palm tree on\nthe reef, flinging up one’s arm and shouting to a person on the beach,\nthe sound took a perceptible time to cross the water: I should say,\nperhaps, an almost perceptible time. The distant signal and the distant\ncall were almost coincident, yet not quite.\n\nDick, mad with delight at the place in which he found himself, was\nrunning about like a dog just out of the water. Mr Button was\ndischarging the cargo of the dinghy on the dry, white sand. Emmeline\nseated herself with her precious bundle on the sand, and was watching\nthe operations of her friend, looking at the things around her and\nfeeling very strange.\n\nFor all she knew all this was the ordinary accompaniment of a sea\nvoyage. Paddy’s manner throughout had been set to the one idea, not to\nfrighten the “childer”; the weather had backed him up. But down in the\nheart of her lay the knowledge that all was not as it should be. The\nhurried departure from the ship, the fog in which her uncle had\nvanished, those things, and others as well, she felt instinctively were\nnot right. But she said nothing.\n\nShe had not long for meditation, however, for Dick was running towards\nher with a live crab which he had picked up, calling out that he was\ngoing to make it bite her.\n\n“Take it away!” cried Emmeline, holding both hands with fingers\nwidespread in front of her face. “Mr Button! Mr Button! Mr Button!”\n\n“Lave her be, you little divil!” roared Pat, who was depositing the\nlast of the cargo on the sand. “Lave her be, or it’s a cow-hidin’ I’ll\nbe givin’ you!”\n\n“What’s a ‘divil,’ Paddy?” asked Dick, panting from his exertions.\n“Paddy, what’s a ‘divil’?”\n\n“You’re wan. Ax no questions now, for it’s tired I am, an’ I want to\nrest me bones.”\n\nHe flung himself under the shade of a palm tree, took out his tinder\nbox, tobacco and pipe, cut some tobacco up, filled his pipe and lit it.\nEmmeline crawled up, and sat near him, and Dick flung himself down on\nthe sand near Emmeline.\n\nMr Button took off his coat and made a pillow of it against a cocoa-nut\ntree stem. He had found the El Dorado of the weary. With his knowledge\nof the South Seas a glance at the vegetation to be seen told him that\nfood for a regiment might be had for the taking; water, too.\n\nRight down the middle of the strand was a depression which in the rainy\nseason would be the bed of a rushing rivulet. The water just now was\nnot strong enough to come all the way to the lagoon, but away up there\n“beyant” in the woods lay the source, and he’d find it in due time.\nThere was enough in the breaker for a week, and green “cuca-nuts” were\nto be had for the climbing.\n\nEmmeline contemplated Paddy for a while as he smoked and rested his\nbones, then a great thought occurred to her. She took the little shawl\nfrom around the parcel she was holding and exposed the mysterious box.\n\n“Oh, begorra, the box!” said Paddy, leaning on his elbow interestedly;\n“I might a’ known you wouldn’t a’ forgot it.”\n\n“Mrs James,” said Emmeline, “made me promise not to open it till I got\non shore, for the things in it might get lost.”\n\n“Well, you’re ashore now,” said Dick; “open it.”\n\n“I’m going to,” said Emmeline.\n\nShe carefully undid the string, refusing the assistance of Paddy’s\nknife. Then the brown paper came off, disclosing a common cardboard\nbox. She raised the lid half an inch, peeped in, and shut it again.\n\n“_Open_ it!” cried Dick, mad with curiosity.\n\n“What’s in it, honey?” asked the old sailor, who was as interested as\nDick.\n\n“Things,” replied Emmeline.\n\nThen all at once she took the lid off and disclosed a tiny tea service\nof china, packed in shavings; there was a teapot with a lid, a cream\njug, cups and saucers, and six microscopic plates, each painted with a\npansy.\n\n“Sure, it’s a tay-set!” said Paddy, in an interested voice. “Glory be\nto God! will you look at the little plates wid the flowers on thim?”\n\n“Heugh!” said Dick in disgust; “I thought it might a’ been soldiers.”\n\n“_I_ don’t want soldiers,” replied Emmeline, in a voice of perfect\ncontentment.\n\nShe unfolded a piece of tissue paper, and took from it a sugar-tongs\nand six spoons. Then she arrayed the whole lot on the sand.\n\n“Well, if that don’t beat all!” said Paddy.\n\n“And whin are you goin’ to ax me to tay with you?”\n\n“Some time,” replied Emmeline, collecting the things, and carefully\nrepacking them.\n\nMr Button finished his pipe, tapped the ashes out, and placed it in his\npocket.\n\n“I’ll be afther riggin’ up a bit of a tint,” said he, as he rose to his\nfeet, “to shelter us from the jew to-night; but I’ll first have a look\nat the woods to see if I can find wather. Lave your box with the other\nthings, Emmeline; there’s no one here to take it.”\n\nEmmeline left her box on the heap of things that Paddy had placed in\nthe shadow of the cocoa-nut trees, took his hand, and the three entered\nthe grove on the right.\n\nIt was like entering a pine forest; the tall symmetrical stems of the\ntrees seemed set by mathematical law, each at a given distance from the\nother. Whichever way you entered a twilight alley set with tree boles\nlay before you. Looking up you saw at an immense distance above a pale\ngreen roof patined with sparkling and flashing points of light, where\nthe breeze was busy playing with the green fronds of the trees.\n\n“Mr Button,” murmured Emmeline, “we won’t get lost, will we?”\n\n“Lost! No, faith; sure we’re goin’ uphill, an’ all we have to do is to\ncome down again, when we want to get back—ware nuts!” A green nut\ndetached from up above came down rattling and tumbling and hopped on\nthe ground. Paddy picked it up. “It’s a green cucanut,” said he,\nputting it in his pocket (it was not very much bigger than a Jaffa\norange), “and we’ll have it for tay.”\n\n“That’s not a cocoa-nut,” said Dick; “cocoa-nuts are brown. I had five\ncents once an’ I bought one, and scraped it out and y’et it.”\n\n“When Dr Sims made Dicky sick,” said Emmeline, “he said the wonder\nt’im was how Dicky held it all.”\n\n“Come on,” said Mr Button, “an’ don’t be talkin’, or it’s the\nCluricaunes will be after us.”\n\n“What’s cluricaunes?” demanded Dick.\n\n“Little men no bigger than your thumb that make the brogues for the\nGood People.”\n\n“Who’s they?”\n\n“Whisht, and don’t be talkin’. Mind your head, Em’leen, or the\nbranches’ll be hittin’ you in the face.”\n\nThey had left the cocoa-nut grove, and entered the chapparel. Here was\na deeper twilight, and all sorts of trees lent their foliage to make\nthe shade. The artu with its delicately diamonded trunk, the great\nbreadfruit tall as a beech, and shadowy as a cave, the aoa, and the\neternal cocoa-nut palm all grew here like brothers. Great ropes of wild\nvine twined like the snake of the laocoon from tree to tree, and all\nsorts of wonderful flowers, from the orchid shaped like a butterfly to\nthe scarlet hibiscus, made beautiful the gloom.\n\nSuddenly Mr Button stopped.\n\n“Whisht!” said he.\n\nThrough the silence—a silence filled with the hum and the murmur of\nwood insects and the faint, far song of the reef—came a tinkling,\nrippling sound: it was water. He listened to make sure of the bearing\nof the sound, then he made for it.\n\nNext moment they found themselves in a little grass-grown glade. From\nthe hilly ground above, over a rock black and polished like ebony, fell\na tiny cascade not much broader than one’s hand; ferns grew around and\nfrom a tree above where a great rope of wild convolvulus flowers blew\ntheir trumpets in the enchanted twilight.\n\nThe children cried out at the prettiness of it, and Emmeline ran and\ndabbled her hands in the water. Just above the little waterfall sprang\na banana tree laden with fruit; it had immense leaves six feet long and\nmore, and broad as a dinner-table. One could see the golden glint of\nthe ripe fruit through the foliage.\n\nIn a moment Mr Button had kicked off his shoes and was going up the\nrock like a cat, absolutely, for it seemed to give him nothing to climb\nby.\n\n“Hurroo!” cried Dick in admiration. “Look at Paddy!”\n\nEmmeline looked, and saw nothing but swaying leaves.\n\n“Stand from under!” he shouted, and next moment down came a huge bunch\nof yellow-jacketed bananas. Dick shouted with delight, but Emmeline\nshowed no excitement: she had discovered something.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nDEATH VEILED WITH LICHEN\n\n“Mr Button,” said she, when the latter had descended, “there’s a little\nbarrel”; she pointed to something green and lichen-covered that lay\nbetween the trunks of two trees—something that eyes less sharp than\nthe eyes of a child might have mistaken for a boulder.\n\n“Sure, an’ faith it’s an’ ould empty bar’l,” said Mr Button, wiping the\nsweat from his brow and staring at the thing. “Some ship must have been\nwathering here an’ forgot it. It’ll do for a sate whilst we have\ndinner.”\n\nHe sat down upon it and distributed the bananas to the children, who\nsat down on the grass.\n\nThe barrel looked such a deserted and neglected thing that his\nimagination assumed it to be empty. Empty or full, however, it made an\nexcellent seat, for it was quarter sunk in the green soft earth, and\nimmovable.\n\n“If ships has been here, ships will come again,” said he, as he munched\nhis bananas.\n\n“Will daddy’s ship come here?” asked Dick.\n\n“Ay, to be sure it will,” replied the other, taking out his pipe. “Now\nrun about and play with the flowers an’ lave me alone to smoke a pipe,\nand then we’ll all go to the top of the hill beyant, and have a look\nround us.\n\n“Come ’long, Em!” cried Dick; and the children started off amongst the\ntrees, Dick pulling at the hanging vine tendrils, and Emmeline plucking\nwhat blossoms she could find within her small reach.\n\nWhen he had finished his pipe he hallooed, and small voices answered\nhim from the wood. Then the children came running back, Emmeline\nlaughing and showing her small white teeth, a large bunch of blossoms\nin her hand; Dick flowerless, but carrying what seemed a large green\nstone.\n\n“Look at what a funny thing I’ve found!” he cried; “it’s got holes in\nit.”\n\n“Dhrap it!” shouted Mr Button, springing from the barrel as if some one\nhad stuck an awl into him. “Where’d you find it? What d’you mane by\ntouchin’ it? Give it here.”\n\nHe took it gingerly in his hands; it was a lichen-covered skull, with a\ngreat dent in the back of it where it had been cloven by an axe or some\nsharp instrument. He hove it as far as he could away amidst the trees.\n\n“What is it, Paddy?” asked Dick, half astonished, half frightened at\nthe old man’s manner.\n\n“It’s nothin’ good,” replied Mr Button.\n\n“There were two others, and I wanted to fetch them,” grumbled Dick.\n\n“You lave them alone. Musha! musha! but there’s been black doin’s here\nin days gone by. What is it, Emmeline?”\n\nEmmeline was holding out her bunch of flowers for admiration. He took a\ngreat gaudy blossom—if flowers can ever be called gaudy—and stuck its\nstalk in the pocket of his coat. Then he led the way uphill, muttering\nas he went.\n\nThe higher they got the less dense became the trees and the fewer the\ncocoa-nut palms. The cocoa-nut palm loves the sea, and the few they had\nhere all had their heads bent in the direction of the lagoon, as if\nyearning after it.\n\nThey passed a cane-brake where canes twenty feet high whispered\ntogether like bulrushes. Then a sunlit sward, destitute of tree or\nshrub, led them sharply upward for a hundred feet or so to where a\ngreat rock, the highest point of the island, stood, casting its shadow\nin the sunshine. The rock was about twenty feet high, and easy to\nclimb. Its top was almost flat, and as spacious as an ordinary\ndinner-table. From it one could obtain a complete view of the island\nand the sea.\n\nLooking down, one’s eye travelled over the trembling and waving\ntree-tops, to the lagoon; beyond the lagoon to the reef, beyond the\nreef to the infinite space of the Pacific. The reef encircled the whole\nisland, here further from the land, here closer; the song of the surf\non it came as a whisper, just like the whisper you hear in a shell;\nbut, a strange thing, though the sound heard on the beach was\ncontinuous, up here one could distinguish an intermittency as breaker\nafter breaker dashed itself to death on the coral strand below.\n\nYou have seen a field of green barley ruffled over by the wind, just so\nfrom the hill-top you could see the wind in its passage over the sunlit\nfoliage beneath.\n\nIt was breezing up from the south-west, and banyan and cocoa-palm, artu\nand breadfruit tree, swayed and rocked in the merry wind. So bright and\nmoving was the picture of the breeze-swept sea, the blue lagoon, the\nfoam-dashed reef, and the rocking trees that one felt one had surprised\nsome mysterious gala day, some festival of Nature more than ordinarily\nglad.\n\nAs if to strengthen the idea, now and then above the trees would burst\nwhat seemed a rocket of coloured stars. The stars would drift away in a\nflock on the wind and be lost. They were flights of birds. All-coloured\nbirds peopled the trees below—blue, scarlet, dove-coloured, bright of\neye, but voiceless. From the reef you could see occasionally the\nsea-gulls rising here and there in clouds like small puffs of smoke.\n\nThe lagoon, here deep, here shallow, presented, according to its depth\nor shallowness, the colours of ultra-marine or sky. The broadest parts\nwere the palest, because the most shallow; and here and there, in the\nshallows, you might see a faint tracery of coral ribs almost reaching\nthe surface. The island at its broadest might have been three miles\nacross. There was not a sign of house or habitation to be seen, and not\na sail on the whole of the wide Pacific.\n\nIt was a strange place to be, up here. To find oneself surrounded by\ngrass and flowers and trees, and all the kindliness of nature, to feel\nthe breeze blow, to smoke one’s pipe, and to remember that one was in a\nplace uninhabited and unknown. A place to which no messages were ever\ncarried except by the wind or the sea-gulls.\n\nIn this solitude the beetle was as carefully painted and the flower as\ncarefully tended as though all the peoples of the civilised world were\nstanding by to criticise or approve.\n\nNowhere in the world, perhaps, so well as here, could you appreciate\nNature’s splendid indifference to the great affairs of Man.\n\nThe old sailor was thinking nothing of this sort. His eyes were fixed\non a small and almost imperceptible stain on the horizon to the\nsou’-sou’-west. It was no doubt another island almost hull-down on the\nhorizon. Save for this blemish the whole wheel of the sea was empty and\nserene.\n\nEmmeline had not followed them up to the rock. She had gone botanising\nwhere some bushes displayed great bunches of the crimson arita berries\nas if to show to the sun what Earth could do in the way of\nmanufacturing poison. She plucked two great bunches of them, and with\nthis treasure came to the base of the rock.\n\n“Lave thim berries down!” cried Mr Button, when she had attracted his\nattention. “Don’t put thim in your mouth; thim’s the never-wake-up\nberries.”\n\nHe came down off the rock, hand over fist, flung the poisonous things\naway, and looked into Emmeline’s small mouth, which at his command she\nopened wide. There was only a little pink tongue in it, however, curled\nup like a rose-leaf; no sign of berries or poison. So, giving her a\nlittle shake, just as a nursemaid would have done in like\ncircumstances, he took Dick off the rock, and led the way back to the\nbeach.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nECHOES OF FAIRY-LAND\n\n“Mr Button,” said Emmeline that night, as they sat on the sand near\nthe tent he had improvised, “Mr Button—cats go to sleep.”\n\nThey had been questioning him about the “never-wake-up” berries.\n\n“Who said they didn’t?” asked Mr Button.\n\n“I mean,” said Emmeline, “they go to sleep and never wake up again.\nOurs did. It had stripes on it, and a white chest, and rings all down\nits tail. It went asleep in the garden, all stretched out, and showing\nits teeth; an’ I told Jane, and Dicky ran in an’ told uncle. I went to\nMrs Sims, the doctor’s wife, to tea; and when I came back I asked Jane\nwhere pussy was—and she said it was deadn’ berried, but I wasn’t to\ntell uncle.”\n\n“I remember,” said Dick. “It was the day I went to the circus, and you\ntold me not to tell daddy the cat was deadn’ berried. But I told Mrs\nJames’s man when he came to do the garden; and I asked him where cats\nwent when they were deadn’ berried, and he said he guessed they went to\nhell—at least he hoped they did, for they were always scratchin’ up\nthe flowers. Then he told me not to tell any one he’d said that, for it\nwas a swear word, and he oughtn’t to have said it. I asked him what\nhe’d give me if I didn’t tell, an’ he gave me five cents. That was the\nday I bought the cocoa-nut.”\n\nThe tent, a makeshift affair, consisting of two sculls and a tree\nbranch, which Mr Button had sawed off from a dwarf aoa, and the\nstay-sail he had brought from the brig, was pitched in the centre of the\nbeach, so as to be out of the way of falling cocoa-nuts, should the\nbreeze strengthen during the night. The sun had set, but the moon had\nnot yet risen as they sat in the starlight on the sand near the\ntemporary abode.\n\n“What’s the things you said made the boots for the people, Paddy?”\nasked Dick, after a pause.\n\n“Which things?”\n\n“You said in the wood I wasn’t to talk, else—”\n\n“Oh, the Cluricaunes—the little men that cobbles the Good People’s\nbrogues. Is it them you mane?”\n\n“Yes,” said Dick, not knowing quite whether it was them or not that he\nmeant, but anxious for information that he felt would be curious. “And\nwhat are the good people?”\n\n“Sure, where were you born and bred that you don’t know the Good People\nis the other name for the fairies—savin’ their presence?”\n\n“There aren’t any,” replied Dick. “Mrs Sims said there weren’t.”\n\n“Mrs James,” put in Emmeline, “said there were. She said she liked to\nsee children b’lieve in fairies. She was talking to another lady, who’d\ngot a red feather in her bonnet, and a fur muff. They were having tea,\nand I was sitting on the hearthrug. She said the world was getting\ntoo—something or another, an’ then the other lady said it was, and\nasked Mrs James did she see Mrs Someone in the awful hat she wore\nThanksgiving Day. They didn’t say anything more about fairies, but Mrs\nJames——”\n\n“Whether you b’lave in them or not,” said Paddy, “there they are. An’\nmaybe they’re poppin’ out of the wood behint us now, an’ listenin’ to\nus talkin’; though I’m doubtful if there’s any in these parts, though\ndown in Connaught they were as thick as blackberries in the ould days.\nO musha! musha! the ould days, the ould days! when will I be seein’\nthim again? Now, you may b’lave me or b’lave me not, but me own ould\nfather—God rest his sowl!—was comin’ over Croagh Patrick one night\nbefore Christmas with a bottle of whisky in one hand of him, and a\ngoose, plucked an’ claned an’ all, in the other, which same he’d won in\na lottery, when, hearin’ a tchune no louder than the buzzin’ of a bee,\nover a furze-bush he peeps, and there, round a big white stone, the\nGood People were dancing in a ring hand in hand, an’ kickin’ their\nheels, an’ the eyes of them glowin’ like the eyes of moths; and a chap\non the stone, no bigger than the joint of your thumb, playin’ to thim\non a bagpipes. Wid that he let wan yell an’ drops the goose an’ makes\nfor home, over hedge an’ ditch, boundin’ like a buck kangaroo, an’ the\nface on him as white as flour when he burst in through the door, where\nwe was all sittin’ round the fire burnin’ chestnuts to see who’d be\nmarried the first.\n\n“‘An’ what in the name of the saints is the mather wid yiz?’ says me\nmother.\n\n“‘I’ve sane the Good People,’ says he, ‘up on the field beyant,’ says\nhe; ‘and they’ve got the goose,’ says he, ‘but, begorra, I’ve saved the\nbottle,’ he says. ‘Dhraw the cork and give me a taste of it, for me\nheart’s in me throat, and me tongue’s like a brick-kil.’\n\n“An’ whin we come to prize the cork out of the bottle, there was\nnothin’ in it; an’ whin we went next marnin’ to look for the goose, it\nwas gone. But there was the stone, sure enough, and the marks on it of\nthe little brogues of the chap that’d played the bagpipes—and who’d be\ndoubtin’ there were fairies after that?”\n\nThe children said nothing for a while, and then Dick said:\n\n“Tell us about Cluricaunes, and how they make the boots.”\n\n“Whin I’m tellin’ you about Cluricaunes,” said Mr Button, “it’s the\ntruth I’m tellin’ you, an’ out of me own knowlidge, for I’ve spoken to a\nman that’s held wan in his hand; he was me own mother’s brother, Con\nCogan—rest his sowl! Con was six fut two, wid a long, white face; he’d\nhad his head bashed in, years before I was barn, in some ruction or\nother, an’ the docthers had japanned him with a five-shillin’ piece\nbeat flat.”\n\nDick interposed with a question as to the process, aim, and object of\njapanning, but Mr Button passed the question by.\n\n“He’d been bad enough for seein’ fairies before they japanned him, but\nafther it, begorra, he was twiced as bad. I was a slip of a lad at the\ntime, but me hair near turned grey wid the tales he’d tell of the Good\nPeople and their doin’s. One night they’d turn him into a harse an’\nride him half over the county, wan chap on his back an’ another runnin’\nbehind, shovin’ furze prickles under his tail to make him buck-lep.\nAnother night it’s a dunkey he’d be, harnessed to a little cart, an’\nbein’ kicked in the belly and made to draw stones. Thin it’s a goose\nhe’d be, runnin’ over the common wid his neck stritched out squawkin’,\nan’ an old fairy woman afther him wid a knife, till it fair drove him\nto the dhrink; though, by the same token, he didn’t want much dhrivin’.\n\n“And what does he do when his money was gone, but tear the\nfive-shillin’ piece they’d japanned him wid aff the top of his hed, and\nswaps it for a bottle of whisky, and that was the end of him.”\n\nMr Button paused to relight his pipe, which had gone out, and there was\nsilence for a moment.\n\nThe moon had risen, and the song of the surf on the reef filled the\nwhole night with its lullaby. The broad lagoon lay waving and rippling\nin the moonlight to the incoming tide. Twice as broad it always looked\nseen by moonlight or starlight than when seen by day. Occasionally the\nsplash of a great fish would cross the silence, and the ripple of it\nwould pass a moment later across the placid water.\n\nBig things happened in the lagoon at night, unseen by eyes from the\nshore. You would have found the wood behind them, had you walked\nthrough it, full of light. A tropic forest under a tropic moon is green\nas a sea cave. You can see the vine tendrils and the flowers, the\norchids and tree boles all lit as by the light of an emerald-tinted day.\n\nMr Button took a long piece of string from his pocket.\n\n“It’s bedtime,” said he; “and I’m going to tether Em’leen, for fear\nshe’d be walkin’ in her slape, and wandherin’ away an’ bein’ lost in\nthe woods.”\n\n“I don’t want to be tethered,” said Emmeline.\n\n“It’s for your own good I’m doin’ it,” replied Mr Button, fixing the\nstring round her waist. “Now come ’long.”\n\nHe led her like a dog in a leash to the tent, and tied the other end of\nthe string to the scull, which was the tent’s main prop and support.\n\n“Now,” said he, “if you be gettin’ up and walkin’ about in the night,\nit’s down the tint will be on top of us all.”\n\nAnd, sure enough, in the small hours of the morning, it was.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nFAIR PICTURES IN THE BLUE\n\n“I don’t want my old britches on! I don’t want my old britches on!”\n\nDick was darting about naked on the sand, Mr Button after him with a\npair of small trousers in his hand. A crab might just as well have\nattempted to chase an antelope.\n\nThey had been on the island a fortnight, and Dick had discovered the\nkeenest joy in life—to be naked. To be naked and wallow in the shallows\nof the lagoon, to be naked and sit drying in the sun. To be free from\nthe curse of clothes, to shed civilisation on the beach in the form of\nbreeches, boots, coat, and hat, and to be one with the wind and the sun\nand the sea.\n\nThe very first command Mr Button had given on the second morning of\ntheir arrival was, “Strip and into the water wid you.”\n\nDick had resisted at first, and Emmeline (who rarely wept) had stood\nweeping in her little chemise. But Mr Button was obdurate. The\ndifficulty at first was to get them in; the difficulty now was to keep\nthem out.\n\nEmmeline was sitting as nude as the day star, drying in the morning sun\nafter her dip, and watching Dick’s evolutions on the sand.\n\nThe lagoon had for the children far more attraction than the land.\nWoods where you might knock ripe bananas off the trees with a big cane,\nsands where golden lizards would scuttle about so tame that you might\nwith a little caution seize them by the tail, a hill-top from whence\nyou might see, to use Paddy’s expression, “to the back of beyond”; all\nthese were fine enough in their way, but they were nothing to the\nlagoon.\n\nDeep down where the coral branches were you might watch, whilst Paddy\nfished, all sorts of things disporting on the sand patches and between\nthe coral tufts. Hermit crabs that had evicted whelks, wearing the\nevicted ones’ shells—an obvious misfit; sea anemones as big as roses.\nFlowers that closed up in an irritable manner if you lowered the hook\ngently down and touched them; extraordinary shells that walked about on\nfeelers, elbowing the crabs out of the way and terrorising the whelks.\nThe overlords of the sand patches, these; yet touch one on the back\nwith a stone tied to a bit of string, and down he would go flat,\nmotionless and feigning death. There was a lot of human nature lurking\nin the depths of the lagoon, comedy and tragedy.\n\nAn English rock-pool has its marvels. You can fancy the marvels of this\nvast rock-pool, nine miles round and varying from a third to half a\nmile broad, swarming with tropic life and flights of painted fishes;\nwhere the glittering albicore passed beneath the boat like a fire and a\nshadow; where the boat’s reflection lay as clear on the bottom as\nthough the water were air; where the sea, pacified by the reef, told,\nlike a little child, its dreams.\n\nIt suited the lazy humour of Mr Button that he never pursued the lagoon\nmore than half a mile or so on either side of the beach. He would bring\nthe fish he caught ashore, and with the aid of his tinder box and dead\nsticks make a blazing fire on the sand; cook fish and breadfruit and\ntaro roots, helped and hindered by the children. They fixed the tent\namidst the trees at the edge of the chapparel, and made it larger and\nmore abiding with the aid of the dinghy’s sail.\n\nAmidst these occupations, wonders, and pleasures, the children lost all\ncount of the flight of time. They rarely asked about Mr Lestrange;\nafter a while they did not ask about him at all. Children soon forget.\n\n\n\n\nPART III\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE POETRY OF LEARNING\n\nTo forget the passage of time you must live in the open air, in a warm\nclimate, with as few clothes as possible upon you. You must collect and\ncook your own food. Then, after a while, if you have no special ties to\nbind you to civilisation, Nature will begin to do for you what she does\nfor the savage. You will recognise that it is possible to be happy\nwithout books or newspapers, letters or bills. You will recognise the\npart sleep plays in Nature.\n\nAfter a month on the island you might have seen Dick at one moment full\nof life and activity, helping Mr Button to dig up a taro root or\nwhat not, the next curled up to sleep like a dog. Emmeline the same.\nProfound and prolonged lapses into sleep; sudden awakenings into a\nworld of pure air and dazzling light, the gaiety of colour all round.\nNature had indeed opened her doors to these children.\n\nOne might have fancied her in an experimental mood, saying: “Let me put\nthese buds of civilisation back into my nursery and see what they will\nbecome—how they will blossom, and what will be the end of it all.”\n\nJust as Emmeline had brought away her treasured box from the\n_Northumberland_, Dick had conveyed with him a small linen bag that\nchinked when shaken. It contained marbles. Small olive-green marbles\nand middle-sized ones of various colours; glass marbles with splendid\ncoloured cores; and one large old grandfather marble too big to be\nplayed with, but none the less to be worshipped—a god marble.\n\nOf course one cannot play at marbles on board ship, but one can play\n_with_ them. They had been a great comfort to Dick on the voyage. He knew\nthem each personally, and he would roll them out on the mattress of his\nbunk and review them nearly every day, whilst Emmeline looked on.\n\nOne day Mr Button, noticing Dick and the girl kneeling opposite each\nother on a flat, hard piece of sand near the water’s edge, strolled up\nto see what they were doing. They were playing marbles. He stood with\nhis hands in his pockets and his pipe in his mouth watching and\ncriticising the game, pleased that the “childer” were amused. Then he\nbegan to be amused himself, and in a few minutes more he was down on\nhis knees taking a hand; Emmeline, a poor player and an unenthusiastic\none, withdrawing in his favour.\n\nAfter that it was a common thing to see them playing together, the old\nsailor on his knees, one eye shut, and a marble against the nail of his\nhorny thumb taking aim; Dick and Emmeline on the watch to make sure he\nwas playing fair, their shrill voices echoing amidst the cocoa-nut\ntrees with cries of “Knuckle down, Paddy, knuckle down!” He entered\ninto all their amusements just as one of themselves. On high and rare\noccasions Emmeline would open her precious box, spread its contents and\ngive a tea-party, Mr Button acting as guest or president as the case\nmight be.\n\n“Is your tay to your likin’, ma’am?” he would enquire; and Emmeline,\nsipping at her tiny cup, would invariably make answer: “Another lump of\nsugar, if you please, Mr Button;” to which would come the stereotyped\nreply: “Take a dozen, and welcome; and another cup for the good of your\nmake.”\n\nThen Emmeline would wash the things in imaginary water, replace them in\nthe box, and every one would lose their company manners and become\nquite natural again.\n\n“Have you ever seen your name, Paddy?” asked Dick one morning.\n\n“Seen me which?”\n\n“Your name?”\n\n“Arrah, don’t be axin’ me questions,” replied the other. “How the divil\ncould I see me name?”\n\n“Wait and I’ll show you,” replied Dick.\n\nHe ran and fetched a piece of cane, and a minute later on the\nsalt-white sand in face of orthography and the sun appeared these\nportentous letters:\n\nB U T T E N\n\n“Faith, an’ it’s a cliver boy y’are,” said Mr Button admiringly, as he\nleaned luxuriously against a cocoa-nut tree, and contemplated Dick’s\nhandiwork. “And that’s me name, is it? What’s the letters in it?”\n\nDick enumerated them.\n\n“I’ll teach you to do it, too,” he said. “I’ll teach you to write your\nname, Paddy—would you like to write your name, Paddy?”\n\n“No,” replied the other, who only wanted to be let smoke his pipe in\npeace; “me name’s no use to me.”\n\nBut Dick, with the terrible gadfly tirelessness of childhood, was not\nto be put off, and the unfortunate Mr Button had to go to school\ndespite himself. In a few days he could achieve the act of drawing upon\nthe sand characters somewhat like the above, but not without prompting,\nDick and Emmeline on each side of him, breathless for fear of a mistake.\n\n“Which next?” would ask the sweating scribe, the perspiration pouring\nfrom his forehead—“which next? an’ be quick, for it’s moithered I am.”\n\n“N. N.—that’s right—Ow, you’re making it crooked!—_that’s_\nright—there! it’s all there now—Hurroo!”\n\n“Hurroo!” would answer the scholar, waving his old hat over his own\nname, and “Hurroo!” would answer the cocoa-nut grove echoes; whilst the\nfar, faint “Hi hi!” of the wheeling gulls on the reef would come over\nthe blue lagoon as if in acknowledgment of the deed, and encouragement.\n\nThe appetite comes with teaching. The pleasantest mental exercise of\nchildhood is the instruction of one’s elders. Even Emmeline felt this.\nShe took the geography class one day in a timid manner, putting her\nlittle hand first in the great horny fist of her friend.\n\n“Mr Button!”\n\n“Well, honey?”\n\n“I know g’ography.”\n\n“And what’s that?” asked Mr Button.\n\nThis stumped Emmeline for a moment.\n\n“It’s where places are,” she said at last.\n\n“Which places?” enquired he.\n\n“All sorts of places,” replied Emmeline. “Mr Button!”\n\n“What is it, darlin’?”\n\n“Would you like to learn g’ography?”\n\n“I’m not wishful for larnin’,” said the other hurriedly. “It makes me\nhead buzz to hear them things they rade out of books.”\n\n“Paddy,” said Dick, who was strong on drawing that afternoon, “look\nhere.” He drew the following on the sand:\n\n[Illustration: A bad drawing of an elephant]\n\n“That’s an elephant,” he said in a dubious voice.\n\nMr Button grunted, and the sound was by no means filled with\nenthusiastic assent. A chill fell on the proceedings.\n\nDick wiped the elephant slowly and regretfully out, whilst Emmeline\nfelt disheartened. Then her face suddenly cleared; the seraphic smile\ncame into it for a moment—a bright idea had struck her.\n\n“Dicky,” she said, “draw Henry the Eight.”\n\nDick’s face brightened. He cleared the sand and drew the following\nfigure:\n\n      l   l\n    <[     ]>\n      /   \\\n\n“_That’s_ not Henry the Eight,” he explained, “but he will be in a\nminute. Daddy showed me how to draw him; he’s nothing till he gets his\nhat on.”\n\n“Put his hat on, put his hat on!” implored Emmeline, gazing alternately\nfrom the figure on the sand to Mr Button’s face, watching for the\ndelighted smile with which she was sure the old man would greet the\ngreat king when he appeared in all his glory.\n\nThen Dick with a single stroke of the cane put Henry’s hat on.\n\n       === l\n       l   l\n     <[     ]>\n       /   \\\n\nNow, no portrait could be liker to his monk-hunting majesty than the\nabove, created with one stroke of a cane (so to speak), yet Mr Button\nremained unmoved.\n\n“I did it for Mrs Sims,” said Dick regretfully, “and _she_ said it was\nthe image of him.”\n\n“Maybe the hat’s not big enough,” said Emmeline, turning her head from\nside to side as she gazed at the picture. It looked right, but she felt\nthere must be something wrong, as Mr Button did not applaud. Has not\nevery true artist felt the same before the silence of some critic?\n\nMr Button tapped the ashes out of his pipe and rose to stretch himself,\nand the class rose and trooped down to the lagoon edge, leaving Henry\nand his hat a figure on the sand to be obliterated by the wind.\n\nAfter a while, as time went on, Mr Button took to his lessons as a\nmatter of course, the small inventions of the children assisting their\nutterly untrustworthy knowledge. Knowledge, perhaps, as useful as any\nother there amidst the lovely poetry of the palm trees and the sky.\n\nDays slipped into weeks, and weeks into months, without the appearance\nof a ship—a fact which gave Mr Button very little trouble; and even\nless to his charges, who were far too busy and amused to bother about\nships.\n\nThe rainy season came on them with a rush, and at the words “rainy\nseason” do not conjure up in your mind the vision of a rainy day in\nManchester.\n\nThe rainy season here was quite a lively time. Torrential showers\nfollowed by bursts of sunshine, rainbows, and rain-dogs in the sky, and\nthe delicious perfume of all manner of growing things on the earth.\n\nAfter the rains the old sailor said he’d be after making a house of\nbamboos before the next rains came on them; but, maybe, before that\nthey’d be off the island.\n\n“However,” said he, “I’ll dra’ you a picture of what it’ll be like when\nit’s up;” and on the sand he drew a figure like this:\n\nX\n\nHaving thus drawn the plans of the building, he leaned back against a\ncocoa-palm and lit his pipe. But he had reckoned without Dick.\n\nThe boy had not the least wish to live in a house, but he had a keen\ndesire to see one built, and help to build one. The ingenuity which is\npart of the multiform basis of the American nature was aroused.\n\n“How’re you going to keep them from slipping, if you tie them together\nlike that?” he asked, when Paddy had more fully explained his method.\n\n“Which from slippin’?”\n\n“The canes—one from the other?”\n\n“After you’ve fixed thim, one cross t’other, you drive a nail through\nthe cross-piece and a rope over all.”\n\n“Have you any nails, Paddy?”\n\n“No,” said Mr Button, “I haven’t.”\n\n“Then how’re you goin’ to build the house?”\n\n“Ax me no questions now; I want to smoke me pipe.”\n\nBut he had raised a devil difficult to lay. Morning, noon, and night it\nwas “Paddy, when are you going to begin the house?” or, “Paddy, I guess\nI’ve got a way to make the canes stick together without nailing.” Till\nMr Button, in despair, like a beaver, began to build.\n\nThere was great cane-cutting in the cane-brake above, and, when\nsufficient had been procured, Mr Button struck work for three days. He\nwould have struck altogether, but he had found a taskmaster.\n\nThe tireless Dick, young and active, with no original laziness in his\ncomposition, no old bones to rest, or pipe to smoke, kept after him\nlike a bluebottle fly. It was in vain that he tried to stave him off\nwith stories about fairies and Cluricaunes. Dick wanted to build a\nhouse.\n\nMr Button didn’t. He wanted to rest. He did not mind fishing or\nclimbing a cocoa-nut tree, which he did to admiration by passing a rope\nround himself and the tree, knotting it, and using it as a support\nduring the climb; but house-building was monotonous work.\n\nHe said he had no nails. Dick countered by showing how the canes could\nbe held together by notching them.\n\n“And, faith, but it’s a cliver boy you are,” said the weary one\nadmiringly, when the other had explained his method.\n\n“Then come along, Paddy, and stick ’em up.”\n\nMr Button said he had no rope, that he’d have to think about it, that\nto-morrow or next day he’d be after getting some notion how to do it\nwithout rope. But Dick pointed out that the brown cloth which Nature\nhas wrapped round the cocoa-palm stalks would do instead of rope if cut\nin strips. Then the badgered one gave in.\n\nThey laboured for a fortnight at the thing, and at the end of that time\nhad produced a rough sort of wigwam on the borders of the chapparel.\n\nOut on the reef, to which they often rowed in the dinghy, when the tide\nwas low, deep pools would be left, and in the pools fish. Paddy said\nif they had a spear they might be able to spear some of these fish, as\nhe had seen the natives do away “beyant” in Tahiti.\n\nDick enquired as to the nature of a spear, and next day produced a\nten-foot cane sharpened at the end after the fashion of a quill pen.\n\n“Sure, what’s the use of that?” said Mr Button. “You might job it into\na fish, but he’d be aff it in two ticks; it’s the barb that holds them.”\n\nNext day the indefatigable one produced the cane amended; he had\nwhittled it down about three feet from the end and on one side, and\ncarved a fairly efficient barb. It was good enough, at all events, to\nspear a “groper” with, that evening, in the sunset-lit pools of the\nreef at low tide.\n\n“There aren’t any potatoes here,” said Dick one day, after the second\nrains.\n\n“We’ve et ’em all months ago,” replied Paddy.\n\n“How do potatoes grow?” enquired Dick.\n\n“Grow, is it? Why, they grow in the ground; and where else would they\ngrow?” He explained the process of potato-planting: cutting them into\npieces so that there was an eye in each piece, and so forth. “Having\ndone this,” said Mr Button, “you just chuck the pieces in the ground;\ntheir eyes grow, green leaves ‘pop up,’ and then, if you dug the roots\nup maybe, six months after, you’d find bushels of potatoes in the\nground, ones as big as your head, and weeny ones. It’s like a family of\nchilder—some’s big and some’s little. But there they are in the\nground, and all you have to do is to take a fark and dig a potful of\nthem with a turn of your wrist, as many a time I’ve done it in the ould\ndays.”\n\n“Why didn’t we do that?” asked Dick.\n\n“Do what?” asked Mr Button.\n\n“Plant some of the potatoes.”\n\n“And where’d we have found the spade to plant them with?”\n\n“I guess we could have fixed up a spade,” replied the boy. “I made a\nspade at home, out of a piece of old board, once—daddy helped.”\n\n“Well, skelp off with you, and make a spade now,” replied the other,\nwho wanted to be quiet and think, “and you and Em’line can dig in the\nsand.”\n\nEmmeline was sitting near by, stringing together some gorgeous blossoms\non a tendril of liana. Months of sun and ozone had made a considerable\ndifference in the child. She was as brown as a gipsy and freckled, not\nvery much taller, but twice as plump. Her eyes had lost considerably\nthat look as though she were contemplating futurity and immensity—not\nas abstractions, but as concrete images, and she had lost the habit of\nsleep-walking.\n\nThe shock of the tent coming down on the first night she was tethered\nto the scull had broken her of it, helped by the new healthful\nconditions of life, the sea-bathing, and the eternal open air. There is\nno narcotic to excel fresh air.\n\nMonths of semi-savagery had made also a good deal of difference in\nDick’s appearance. He was two inches taller than on the day they\nlanded. Freckled and tanned, he had the appearance of a boy of twelve.\nHe was the promise of a fine man. He was not a good-looking child, but\nhe was healthy-looking, with a jolly laugh, and a daring, almost\nimpudent expression of face.\n\nThe question of the children’s clothes was beginning to vex the mind of\nthe old sailor. The climate was a suit of clothes in itself. One was\nmuch happier with almost nothing on. Of course there were changes of\ntemperature, but they were slight. Eternal summer, broken by torrential\nrains, and occasionally a storm, that was the climate of the island;\nstill, the “childer” couldn’t go about with nothing on.\n\nHe took some of the striped flannel and made Emmeline a kilt. It was\nfunny to see him sitting on the sand, Emmeline standing before him with\nher garment round her waist, being tried on; he, with a mouthful of\npins, and the housewife with the scissors, needles, and thread by his\nside.\n\n“Turn to the lift a bit more,” he’d say, “aisy does it. Stidy\nso—musha! musha! where’s thim scissors? Dick, be holdin’ the end of\nthis bit of string till I get the stitches in behint. Does that hang\ncomfortable?—well, an’ you’re the trouble an’ all. How’s _that_? That’s\naisier, is it? Lift your fut till I see if it comes to your knees. Now\noff with it, and lave me alone till I stitch the tags to it.”\n\nIt was the mixture of a skirt and the idea of a sail, for it had two\nrows of reef points; a most ingenious idea, as it could be reefed if\nthe child wanted to go paddling, or in windy weather.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE DEVIL’S CASK\n\nOne morning, about a week after the day on which the old sailor, to use\nhis own expression, had bent a skirt on Emmeline, Dick came through the\nwoods and across the sands running. He had been on the hill-top.\n\n“Paddy,” he cried to the old man, who was fixing a hook on a\nfishing-line, “there’s a ship!”\n\nIt did not take Mr Button long to reach the hill-top, and there she\nwas, beating up for the island. Bluff-bowed and squab, the figure of an\nold Dutch woman, and telling of her trade a league off. It was just\nafter the rains, the sky was not yet quite clear of clouds; you could\nsee showers away at sea, and the sea was green and foam-capped.\n\nThere was the trying-out gear; there were the boats, the crow’s nest,\nand all complete, and labelling her a whaler. She was a ship, no doubt,\nbut Paddy Button would as soon have gone on board a ship manned by\ndevils, and captained by Lucifer, as on board a South Sea whaleman. He\nhad been there before, and he knew.\n\nHe hid the children under a large banyan, and told them not to stir or\nbreathe till he came back, for the ship was “the devil’s own ship”; and\nif the men on board caught them they’d skin them alive and all.\n\nThen he made for the beach; he collected all the things out of the\nwigwam, and all the old truck in the shape of boots and old clothes,\nand stowed them away in the dinghy. He would have destroyed the house,\nif he could, but he hadn’t time. Then he rowed the dinghy a hundred\nyards down the lagoon to the left, and moored her under the shade of an\naoa, whose branches grew right over the water. Then he came back\nthrough the cocoa-nut grove on foot, and peered through the trees over\nthe lagoon to see what was to be seen.\n\nThe wind was blowing dead on for the opening in the reef, and the old\nwhaleman came along breasting the swell with her bluff bows, and\nentered the lagoon. There was no leadsman in her chains. She just came\nin as if she knew all the soundings by heart—as probably she did—for\nthese whalemen know every hole and corner in the Pacific.\n\nThe anchor fell with a splash, and she swung to it, making a strange\nenough picture as she floated on the blue mirror, backed by the\ngraceful palm tree on the reef. Then Mr Button, without waiting to see\nthe boats lowered, made back to his charges, and the three camped in\nthe woods that night.\n\nNext morning the whaleman was off and away, leaving as a token of her\nvisit the white sand all trampled, an empty bottle, half an old\nnewspaper, and the wigwam torn to pieces.\n\nThe old sailor cursed her and her crew, for the incident had brought a\nnew exercise into his lazy life. Every day now at noon he had to climb\nthe hill, on the look-out for whalemen. Whalemen haunted his dreams,\nthough I doubt if he would willingly have gone on board even a Royal\nMail steamer. He was quite happy where he was. After long years of the\nfo’cs’le the island was a change indeed. He had tobacco enough to last\nhim for an indefinite time, the children for companions, and food at\nhis elbow. He would have been entirely happy if the island had only\nbeen supplied by Nature with a public-house.\n\nThe spirit of hilarity and good fellowship, however, who suddenly\ndiscovered this error on the part of Nature, rectified it, as will be\npresently seen.\n\nThe most disastrous result of the whaleman’s visit was not the\ndestruction of the “house,” but the disappearance of Emmeline’s box.\nHunt high or hunt low, it could not be found. Mr Button in his hurry\nmust have forgotten it when he removed the things to the dinghy—at all\nevents, it was gone. Probably one of the crew of the whalemen had found\nit and carried it off with him; no one could say. It was gone, and\nthere was the end of the matter, and the beginning of great\ntribulation, that lasted Emmeline for a week.\n\nShe was intensely fond of coloured things, coloured flowers especially;\nand she had the prettiest way of making them into a wreath for her own\nor some one else’s head. It was the hat-making instinct that was at work\nin her, perhaps; at all events, it was a feminine instinct, for Dick\nmade no wreaths.\n\nOne morning, as she was sitting by the old sailor engaged in stringing\nshells, Dick came running along the edge of the grove. He had just come\nout of the wood, and he seemed to be looking for something. Then he\nfound what he was in search of—a big shell—and with it in his hand\nmade back to the wood.\n\n_Item._—His dress was a piece of cocoa-nut cloth tied round his middle.\nWhy he wore it at all, goodness knows, for he would as often as not be\nrunning about stark naked.\n\n“I’ve found something, Paddy!” he cried, as he disappeared among the\ntrees.\n\n“What have you found?” piped Emmeline, who was always interested in new\nthings.\n\n“Something funny!” came back from amidst the trees.\n\nPresently he returned; but he was not running now. He was walking\nslowly and carefully, holding the shell as if it contained something\nprecious that he was afraid would escape.\n\n“Paddy, I turned over the old barrel and it had a cork thing in it, and\nI pulled it out, and the barrel is full of awfully funny-smelling\nstuff—I’ve brought some for you to see.”\n\nHe gave the shell into the old sailor’s hands. There was about half a\ngill of yellow liquid in the shell. Paddy smelt it, tasted, and gave a\nshout.\n\n“Rum, begorra!”\n\n“What is it, Paddy?” asked Emmeline.\n\n“_Where_ did you say you got it—in the ould bar’l, did you say?” asked\nMr Button, who seemed dazed and stunned as if by a blow.\n\n“Yes; I pulled the cork thing out—”\n\n“_Did yiz put it back?_”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Oh, glory be to God! Here have I been, time out of mind, sittin’ on an\nould empty bar’l, with me tongue hangin’ down to me heels for the want\nof a drink, and it full of rum all the while!”\n\nHe took a sip of the stuff, tossed the lot off, closed his lips tight\nto keep in the fumes, and shut one eye.\n\nEmmeline laughed.\n\nMr Button scrambled to his feet. They followed him through the\nchapparel till they reached the water source. There lay the little\ngreen barrel; turned over by the restless Dick, it lay with its bung\npointing to the leaves above. You could see the hollow it had made in\nthe soft soil during the years. So green was it, and so like an object\nof nature, a bit of old tree-bole, or a lichen-stained boulder, that\nthough the whalemen had actually watered from the source, its real\nnature had not been discovered.\n\nMr Button tapped on it with the butt end of the shell: it was nearly\nfull. Why it had been left there, by whom, or how, there was no one to\ntell. The old lichen-covered skulls might have told, could they have\nspoken.\n\n“We’ll rowl it down to the beach,” said Paddy, when he had taken\nanother taste of it.\n\nHe gave Dick a sip. The boy spat it out, and made a face, then, pushing\nthe barrel before them, they began to roll it downhill to the beach,\nEmmeline running before them crowned with flowers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE RAT HUNT\n\nThey had dinner at noon. Paddy knew how to cook fish, island fashion,\nwrapping them in leaves, and baking them in a hole in the ground in\nwhich a fire had previously been lit. They had fish and taro root\nbaked, and green cocoa-nuts; and after dinner Mr Button filled a big\nshell with rum, and lit his pipe.\n\nThe rum had been good originally, and age had improved it. Used as he\nwas to the appalling balloon juice sold in the drinking dens of the\n“Barbary coast” at San Francisco, or the public-houses of the docks,\nthis stuff was nectar.\n\nJoviality radiated from him: it was infectious. The children felt that\nsome happy influence had fallen upon their friend. Usually after dinner\nhe was drowsy and “wishful to be quiet.” To-day he told them stories of\nthe sea, and sang them songs—chantys:\n\n  “I’m a flyin’ fish sailor come back from Hong Kong,\n  Yeo ho! blow the man down.\n  Blow the man down, bullies, blow the man down,\n  Oh, give us _time_ to blow the man down.\n  You’re a dhirty black-baller come back from New York,\n  Yeo ho! blow the man down,\n  Blow the man down, bullies, blow the man down.\n  Oh, give us time to blow the man down.”\n\n“Oh, give us _time_ to blow the man down!” echoed Dick and Emmeline.\n\nUp above, in the trees, the bright-eyed birds were watching them—such\na happy party. They had all the appearance of picnickers, and the song\nechoed amongst the cocoa-nut trees, and the wind carried it over the\nlagoon to where the sea-gulls were wheeling and screaming, and the foam\nwas thundering on the reef.\n\nThat evening, Mr Button feeling inclined for joviality, and not wishing\nthe children to see him under the influence, rolled the barrel through\nthe cocoa-nut grove to a little clearing by the edge of the water.\nThere, when the children were in bed and asleep, he repaired with some\ngreen cocoa-nuts and a shell. He was generally musical when amusing\nhimself in this fashion, and Emmeline, waking up during the night,\nheard his voice borne through the moonlit cocoa-nut grove by the wind:\n\n  “There were five or six old drunken sailors\n    Standin’ before the bar,\n  And Larry, he was servin’ them\n    From a big five-gallon jar.\n\n          “_Chorus._—\n  Hoist up the flag, long may it wave!\n    Long may it lade us to glory or the grave.\n  Stidy, boys, stidy—sound the jubilee,\n    For Babylon has fallen, and the niggers are all set free.”\n\nNext morning the musician awoke beside the cask. He had not a trace of\na headache, or any bad feeling, but he made Dick do the cooking; and he\nlay in the shade of the cocoa-nut trees, with his head on a “pilla”\nmade out of an old coat rolled up, twiddling his thumbs, smoking his\npipe, and discoursing about the “ould” days, half to himself and half\nto his companions.\n\nThat night he had another musical evening all to himself, and so it\nwent on for a week. Then he began to lose his appetite and sleep; and\none morning Dick found him sitting on the sand looking very queer\nindeed—as well he might, for he had been “seeing things” since dawn.\n\n“What is it, Paddy?” said the boy, running up, followed by Emmeline.\n\nMr Button was staring at a point on the sand close by. He had his right\nhand raised after the manner of a person who is trying to catch a fly.\nSuddenly he made a grab at the sand, and then opened his hand wide to\nsee what he had caught.\n\n“What is it, Paddy?”\n\n“The Cluricaune,” replied Mr Button. “All dressed in green he\nwas—musha! musha! but it’s only pretindin’ I am.”\n\nThe complaint from which he was suffering has this strange thing about\nit, that, though the patient sees rats, or snakes, or what not, as\nreal-looking as the real things, and though they possess his mind for a\nmoment, almost immediately he recognises that he is suffering from a\ndelusion.\n\nThe children laughed, and Mr Button laughed in a stupid sort of way.\n\n“Sure, it was only a game I was playin’—there was no Cluricaune at\nall—it’s whin I dhrink rum it puts it into me head to play games like\nthat. Oh, be the Holy Poker, there’s red rats comin’ out of the sand!”\n\nHe got on his hands and knees and scuttled off towards the cocoa-nut\ntrees, looking over his shoulder with a bewildered expression on his\nface. He would have risen to fly, only he dared not stand up.\n\nThe children laughed and danced round him as he crawled.\n\n“Look at the rats, Paddy! look at the rats!” cried Dick.\n\n“They’re in front of me!” cried the afflicted one, making a vicious\ngrab at an imaginary rodent’s tail. “Ran dan the bastes!—now they’re\ngone. Musha, but it’s a fool I’m makin’ of meself.”\n\n“Go on, Paddy,” said Dick; “don’t stop— Look there—there’s more rats\ncoming after you!”\n\n“Oh, whisht, will you?” replied Paddy, taking his seat on the sand, and\nwiping his brow. “They’re aff me now.”\n\nThe children stood by, disappointed of their game. Good acting appeals\nto children just as much as to grown-up people. They stood waiting for\nanother access of humour to take the comedian, and they had not to wait\nlong.\n\nA thing like a flayed horse came out of the lagoon and up the beach,\nand this time Mr Button did not crawl away. He got on his feet and ran.\n\n“It’s a harse that’s afther me—it’s a harse that’s afther me! Dick!\nDick! hit him a skelp. Dick! Dick! dhrive him away.”\n\n“Hurroo! Hurroo!” cried Dick, chasing the afflicted one, who was\nrunning in a wide circle, his broad red face slewed over his left\nshoulder. “Go it, Paddy! go it, Paddy!”\n\n“Kape off me, you baste!” shouted Paddy. “Holy Mary, Mother of God!\nI’ll land you a kick wid me fut if yiz come nigh me. Em’leen! Em’leen!\ncome betune us!”\n\nHe tripped, and over he went on the sand, the indefatigable Dick\nbeating him with a little switch he had picked up to make him continue.\n\n“I’m better now, but I’m near wore out,” said Mr Button, sitting up on\nthe sand. “But, bedad, if I’m chased by any more things like them it’s\ninto the say I’ll be dashin’. Dick, lend me your arum.”\n\nHe took Dick’s arm and wandered over to the shade of the trees. Here\nhe threw himself down, and told the children to leave him to sleep.\nThey recognised that the game was over and left him. And he slept for\nsix hours on end; it was the first real sleep he had had for several\ndays. When he awoke he was well, but very shaky.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nSTARLIGHT ON THE FOAM\n\nMr Button saw no more rats, much to Dick’s disappointment. He was off\nthe drink. At dawn next day he got up, refreshed by a second sleep, and\nwandered down to the edge of the lagoon. The opening in the reef faced\nthe east, and the light of the dawn came rippling in with the flooding\ntide.\n\n“It’s a baste I’ve been,” said the repentant one—“a brute baste.”\n\nHe was quite wrong; as a matter of fact, he was only a man beset and\nbetrayed.\n\nHe stood for a while, cursing the drink, “and them that sells it.” Then\nhe determined to put himself out of the way of temptation. Pull the\nbung out of the barrel, and let the contents escape?\n\nSuch a thought never even occurred to him—or, if it did, was instantly\ndismissed; for, though an old sailor-man may curse the drink, good rum\nis to him a sacred thing; and to empty half a little barrel of it into\nthe sea, would be an act almost equivalent to child-murder. He put the\ncask into the dinghy, and rowed it over to the reef. There he placed it\nin the shelter of a great lump of coral, and rowed back.\n\nPaddy had been trained all his life to rhythmical drunkenness. Four\nmonths or so had generally elapsed between his bouts—sometimes six; it\nall depended on the length of the voyage. Six months now elapsed before\nhe felt even an inclination to look at the rum cask, that tiny dark\nspot away on the reef. And it was just as well, for during those six\nmonths another whale-ship arrived, watered and was avoided.\n\n“Blisther it!” said he; “the say here seems to breed whale-ships, and\nnothin’ but whale-ships. It’s like bugs in a bed: you kill wan, and then\nanother comes. Howsomever, we’re shut of thim for a while.”\n\nHe walked down to the lagoon edge, looked at the little dark spot and\nwhistled. Then he walked back to prepare dinner. That little dark spot\nbegan to trouble him after a while; not it, but the spirit it contained.\n\nDays grew long and weary, the days that had been so short and pleasant.\nTo the children there was no such thing as time. Having absolute and\nperfect health, they enjoyed happiness as far as mortals can enjoy it.\nEmmeline’s highly-strung nervous system, it is true, developed a\nheadache when she had been too long in the glare of the sun, but they\nwere few and far between.\n\nThe spirit in the little cask had been whispering across the lagoon for\nsome weeks; at last it began to shout. Mr Button, metaphorically\nspeaking, stopped his ears. He busied himself with the children as much\nas possible. He made another garment for Emmeline, and cut Dick’s hair\nwith the scissors (a job which was generally performed once in a couple\nof months).\n\nOne night, to keep the rum from troubling his head, he told them the\nstory of Jack Dogherty and the Merrow, which is well known on the\nwestern coast.\n\nThe Merrow takes Jack to dinner at the bottom of the sea, and shows him\nthe lobster pots wherein he keeps the souls of old sailor-men, and then\nthey have dinner, and the Merrow produces a big bottle of rum.\n\nIt was a fatal story for him to remember and recount; for, after his\ncompanions were asleep, the vision of the Merrow and Jack hobnobbing,\nand the idea of the jollity of it, rose before him, and excited a\nthirst for joviality not to be resisted.\n\nThere were some green cocoa-nuts that he had plucked that day lying in\na little heap under a tree—half a dozen or so. He took several of\nthese and a shell, found the dinghy where it was moored to the aoa\ntree, unmoored her, and pushed off into the lagoon.\n\nThe lagoon and sky were full of stars. In the dark depths of the water\nmight have been seen phosphorescent gleams of passing fish, and the\nthunder of the surf on the reef filled the night with its song.\n\nHe fixed the boat’s painter carefully round a spike of coral and landed\non the reef, and with a shellful of rum and cocoa-nut lemonade mixed\nhalf and half, he took his perch on a high ledge of coral from whence a\nview of the sea and the coral strand could be obtained.\n\nOn a moonlight night it was fine to sit here and watch the great\nbreakers coming in, all marbled and clouded and rainbowed with\nspindrift and sheets of spray. But the snow and the song of them under\nthe diffused light of the stars produced a more indescribably beautiful\nand strange effect.\n\nThe tide was going out now, and Mr Button, as he sat smoking his pipe\nand drinking his grog, could see bright mirrors here and there where\nthe water lay in rock-pools. When he had contemplated these sights for\na considerable time in complete contentment, he returned to the lagoon\nside of the reef and sat down beside the little barrel. Then, after a\nwhile, if you had been standing on the strand opposite, you would have\nheard scraps of song borne across the quivering water of the lagoon.\n\n  “Sailing down, sailing down\n  On the coast of Barbaree.”\n\nWhether the coast of Barbary in question is that at San Francisco, or\nthe true and proper coast, does not matter. It is an old-time song; and\nwhen you hear it, whether on a reef of coral or a granite quay, you may\nfeel assured that an old-time sailor-man is singing it, and that the\nold-time sailor-man is bemused.\n\nPresently the dinghy put off from the reef, the sculls broke the\nstarlit waters and great shaking circles of light made rhythmical\nanswer to the slow and steady creak of the thole pins against the\nleather. He tied up to the aoa, saw that the sculls were safely\nshipped; then, breathing heavily, he cast off his boots for fear of\nwaking the “childer.” As the children were sleeping more than two\nhundred yards away, this was a needless precaution—especially as the\nintervening distance was mostly soft sand.\n\nGreen cocoa-nut juice and rum mixed together are pleasant enough to\ndrink, but they are better drunk separately; combined, not even the\nbrain of an old sailor can make anything of them but mist and\nmuddlement; that is to say, in the way of thought—in the way of action\nthey can make him do a lot. They made Paddy Button swim the lagoon.\n\nThe recollection came to him all at once, as he was walking up the\nstrand towards the wigwam, that he had left the dinghy tied to the\nreef. The dinghy was, as a matter of fact, safe and sound tied to the\naoa; but Mr Button’s memory told him it was tied to the reef. How he\nhad crossed the lagoon was of no importance at all to him; the fact\nthat he had crossed without the boat, yet without getting wet, did not\nappear to him strange. He had no time to deal with trifles like these.\nThe dinghy had to be fetched across the lagoon, and there was only one\nway of fetching it. So he came back down the beach to the water’s edge,\ncast down his boots, cast off his coat, and plunged in. The lagoon was\nwide, but in his present state of mind he would have swum the\nHellespont. His figure gone from the beach, the night resumed its\nmajesty and aspect of meditation.\n\nSo lit was the lagoon by starshine that the head of the swimmer could\nbe distinguished away out in the midst of circles of light; also, as\nthe head neared the reef, a dark triangle that came shearing through\nthe water past the palm tree at the pier. It was the night patrol of the\nlagoon, who had heard in some mysterious manner that a drunken\nsailor-man was making trouble in his waters.\n\nLooking, one listened, hand on heart, for the scream of the arrested\none, yet it did not come. The swimmer, scrambling on to the reef in an\nexhausted manner, forgetful evidently of the object for which he had\nreturned, made for the rum cask, and fell down beside it as though\nsleep had touched him instead of death.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHE DREAMER ON THE REEF\n\n“I wonder where Paddy is?” cried Dick next morning. He was coming out\nof the chapparel pulling a dead branch after him. “He’s left his coat\non the sand, and the tinder box in it, so I’ll make the fire. There’s\nno use waiting. I want my breakfast. Bother——”\n\nHe trod the dead stick with his naked feet, breaking it into pieces.\n\nEmmeline sat on the sand and watched him.\n\nEmmeline had two gods of a sort: Paddy Button and Dick. Paddy was\nalmost an esoteric god wrapped in the fumes of tobacco and mystery. The\ngod of rolling ships and creaking masts—the masts and vast sail spaces\nof the _Northumberland_ were an enduring vision in her mind—the deity\nwho had lifted her from a little boat into this marvellous place, where\nthe birds were coloured and the fish were painted, where life was never\ndull, and the skies scarcely ever grey.\n\nDick, the other deity, was a much more understandable personage, but no\nless admirable, as a companion and protector. In the two years and five\nmonths of island life he had grown nearly three inches. He was as\nstrong as a boy of twelve, and could scull the boat almost as well as\nPaddy himself, and light a fire. Indeed, during the last few months Mr\nButton, engaged in resting his bones, and contemplating rum as an\nabstract idea, had left the cooking and fishing and general gathering\nof food as much as possible to Dick.\n\n“It amuses the craythur to pritind he’s doing things,” he would say,\nas he watched Dick delving in the earth to make a little\noven—island-fashion—for the cooking of fish or what not.\n\n“Come along, Em,” said Dick, piling the broken wood on top of some\nrotten hibiscus sticks; “give me the tinder box.”\n\nHe got a spark on to a bit of punk, and then he blew at it, looking not\nunlike Æolus as represented on those old Dutch charts that smell of\nschiedam and snuff, and give one mermaids and angels instead of\nsoundings.\n\nThe fire was soon sparkling and crackling, and he heaped on sticks in\nprofusion, for there was plenty of fuel, and he wanted to cook\nbreadfruit.\n\nThe breadfruit varies in size, according to age, and in colour\naccording to season. These that Dick was preparing to cook were as\nlarge as small melons. Two would be more than enough for three people’s\nbreakfast. They were green and knobbly on the outside, and they\nsuggested to the mind unripe lemons, rather than bread.\n\nHe put them in the embers, just as you put potatoes to roast, and\npresently they sizzled and spat little venomous jets of steam, then\nthey cracked, and the white inner substance became visible. He cut\nthem open and took the core out—the core is not fit to eat—and they\nwere ready.\n\nMeanwhile, Emmeline, under his directions, had not been idle.\n\nThere were in the lagoon—there are in several other tropical lagoons I\nknow of—a fish which I can only describe as a golden herring. A bronze\nherring it looks when landed, but when swimming away down against the\nbackground of coral brains and white sand patches, it has the sheen of\nburnished gold. It is as good to eat as to look at, and Emmeline was\ncarefully toasting several of them on a piece of cane.\n\nThe juice of the fish kept the cane from charring, though there were\naccidents at times, when a whole fish would go into the fire, amidst\nshouts of derision from Dick.\n\nShe made a pretty enough picture as she knelt, the “skirt” round the\nwaist looking not unlike a striped bath-towel, her small face intent,\nand filled with the seriousness of the job on hand, and her lips\npuckered out at the heat of the fire.\n\n“It’s so hot!” she cried in self-defence, after the first of the\naccidents.\n\n“Of course it’s hot,” said Dick, “if you stick to looward of the fire.\nHow often has Paddy told you to keep to windward of it!”\n\n“I don’t know which is which,” confessed the unfortunate Emmeline, who\nwas an absolute failure at everything practical: who could neither row\nnor fish, nor throw a stone, and who, though they had now been on the\nisland twenty-eight months or so, could not even swim.\n\n“You mean to say,” said Dick, “that you don’t know where the wind comes\nfrom?”\n\n“Yes, I know that.”\n\n“Well, that’s to windward.”\n\n“I didn’t know that.”\n\n“Well, you know it now.”\n\n“Yes, I know it now.”\n\n“Well, then, come to windward of the fire. Why didn’t you ask the\nmeaning of it before?”\n\n“I did,” said Emmeline; “I asked Mr Button one day, and he told me a\nlot about it. He said if he was to spit to windward and a person was to\nstand to loo’ard of him, he’d be a fool; and he said if a ship went too\nmuch to loo’ard she went on the rocks, but I didn’t understand what he\nmeant. Dicky, I wonder where he is?”\n\n“Paddy!” cried Dick, pausing in the act of splitting open a breadfruit.\nEchoes came from amidst the cocoa-nut trees, but nothing more.\n\n“Come on,” said Dick; “I’m not going to wait for him. He may have gone\nto fetch up the night lines”—they sometimes put down night lines in\nthe lagoon—“and fallen asleep over them.”\n\nNow, though Emmeline honoured Mr Button as a minor deity, Dick had no\nillusions at all upon the matter. He admired Paddy because he could\nknot, and splice, and climb a cocoa-nut tree, and exercise his sailor\ncraft in other admirable ways, but he felt the old man’s limitations.\nThey ought to have had potatoes now, but they had eaten both potatoes\nand the possibility of potatoes when they consumed the contents of that\nhalf sack. Young as he was, Dick felt the absolute thriftlessness of\nthis proceeding. Emmeline did not; she never thought of potatoes,\nthough she could have told you the colour of all the birds on the\nisland.\n\nThen, again, the house wanted rebuilding, and Mr Button said every day\nhe would set about seeing after it to-morrow, and on the morrow it\nwould be to-morrow. The necessities of the life they led were a\nstimulus to the daring and active mind of the boy; but he was always\nbeing checked by the go-as-you-please methods of his elder. Dick came\nof the people who make sewing machines and typewriters. Mr Button came\nof a people notable for ballads, tender hearts, and potheen. That was\nthe main difference.\n\n“Paddy!” again cried the boy, when he had eaten as much as he wanted.\n“Hullo! where are you?”\n\nThey listened, but no answer came. A bright-hued bird flew across the\nsand space, a lizard scuttled across the glistening sand, the reef\nspoke, and the wind in the tree-tops; but Mr Button made no reply.\n\n“Wait,” said Dick.\n\nHe ran through the grove towards the aoa where the dinghy was moored;\nthen he returned.\n\n“The dinghy is all right,” he said. “Where on earth can he be?”\n\n“I don’t know,” said Emmeline, upon whose heart a feeling of loneliness\nhad fallen.\n\n“Let’s go up the hill,” said Dick; “perhaps we’ll find him there.”\n\nThey went uphill through the wood, past the water-course. Every now and\nthen Dick would call out, and echoes would answer—there were quaint,\nmoist-voiced echoes amidst the trees—or a bevy of birds would take\nflight. The little waterfall gurgled and whispered, and the great\nbanana leaves spread their shade.\n\n“Come on,” said Dick, when he had called again without receiving a\nreply.\n\nThey found the hill-top, and the great boulder stood casting its shadow\nin the sun. The morning breeze was blowing, the sea sparkling, the reef\nflashing, the foliage of the island waving in the wind like the flames\nof a green-flamed torch. A deep swell was spreading itself across the\nbosom of the Pacific. Some hurricane away beyond the Navigators or\nGilberts had sent this message and was finding its echo here, a\nthousand miles away, in the deeper thunder of the reef.\n\nNowhere else in the world could you get such a picture, such a\ncombination of splendour and summer, such a vision of freshness and\nstrength, and the delight of morning. It was the smallness of the\nisland, perhaps, that closed the charm and made it perfect. Just a\nbunch of foliage and flowers set in the midst of the blowing wind and\nsparkling blue.\n\nSuddenly Dick, standing beside Emmeline on the rock, pointed with his\nfinger to the reef near the opening.\n\n“There he is!” cried he.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE GARLAND OF FLOWERS\n\nYou could just make the figure out lying on the reef near the little\ncask, and comfortably sheltered from the sun by an upstanding lump of\ncoral.\n\n“He’s asleep,” said Dick.\n\nHe had not thought to look towards the reef from the beach, or he might\nhave seen the figure before.\n\n“Dicky!” said Emmeline.\n\n“Well?”\n\n“How did he get over, if you said the dinghy was tied to the tree?”\n\n“I don’t know,” said Dick, who had not thought of this; “there he is,\nanyhow. I’ll tell you what, Em, we’ll row across and wake him. I’ll boo\ninto his ear and make him jump.”\n\nThey got down from the rock, and came back down through the wood. As\nthey came Emmeline picked flowers and began making them up into one of\nher wreaths. Some scarlet hibiscus, some bluebells, a couple of pale\npoppies with furry stalks and bitter perfume.\n\n“What are you making that for?” asked Dick, who always viewed\nEmmeline’s wreath-making with a mixture of compassion and vague disgust.\n\n“I’m going to put it on Mr Button’s head,” said Emmeline; “so’s when\nyou say boo into his ear he’ll jump up with it on.”\n\nDick chuckled with pleasure at the idea of the practical joke, and\nalmost admitted in his own mind for a moment, that after all there\nmight be a use for such futilities as wreaths.\n\nThe dinghy was moored under the spreading shade of the aoa, the painter\ntied to one of the branches that projected over the water. These dwarf\naoas branch in an extraordinary way close to the ground, throwing out\nlimbs like rails. The tree had made a good protection for the little\nboat, protecting it from marauding hands and from the sun; besides the\nprotection of the tree Paddy had now and then scuttled the boat in\nshallow water. It was a new boat to start with, and with precautions\nlike these might be expected to last many years.\n\n“Get in,” said Dick, pulling on the painter so that the bow of the\ndinghy came close to the beach.\n\nEmmeline got carefully in, and went aft. Then Dick got in, pushed off,\nand took to the sculls. Next moment they were out on the sparkling\nwater.\n\nDick rowed cautiously, fearing to wake the sleeper. He fastened the\npainter to the coral spike that seemed set there by nature for the\npurpose. He scrambled on to the reef, and lying down on his stomach\ndrew the boat’s gunwale close up so that Emmeline might land. He had no\nboots on; the soles of his feet, from constant exposure, had become\ninsensitive as leather.\n\nEmmeline also was without boots. The soles of her feet, as is always\nthe case with highly nervous people, were sensitive, and she walked\ndelicately, avoiding the worst places, holding her wreath in her right\nhand.\n\nIt was full tide, and the thunder of the waves outside shook the reef.\nIt was like being in a church when the deep bass of the organ is turned\nfull on, shaking the ground and the air, the walls and the roof. Dashes\nof spray came over with the wind, and the melancholy “Hi, hi!” of the\nwheeling gulls came like the voices of ghostly sailor-men hauling at\nthe halyards.\n\nPaddy was lying on his right side steeped in profound oblivion. His\nface was buried in the crook of his right arm, and his brown tattooed\nleft hand lay on his left thigh, palm upwards. He had no hat, and the\nbreeze stirred his grizzled hair.\n\nDick and Emmeline stole up to him till they got right beside him. Then\nEmmeline, flashing out a laugh, flung the little wreath of flowers on\nthe old man’s head, and Dick, popping down on his knees, shouted into\nhis ear. But the dreamer did not stir or move a finger.\n\n“Paddy,” cried Dick, “wake up! wake up!”\n\nHe pulled at the shoulder till the figure from its sideways posture\nfell over on its back. The eyes were wide open and staring. The mouth\nhung open, and from the mouth darted a little crab; it scuttled over\nthe chin and dropped on the coral.\n\nEmmeline screamed, and screamed, and would have fallen, but the boy\ncaught her in his arms—one side of the face had been destroyed by the\nlarvæ of the rocks.\n\nHe held her to him as he stared at the terrible figure lying upon its\nback, hands outspread. Then, wild with terror, he dragged her towards\nthe little boat. She was struggling, and panting and gasping, like a\nperson drowning in ice-cold water.\n\nHis one instinct was to escape, to fly—anywhere, no matter where. He\ndragged the girl to the coral edge, and pulled the boat up close. Had\nthe reef suddenly become enveloped in flames he could not have exerted\nhimself more to escape from it and save his companion. A moment later\nthey were afloat, and he was pulling wildly for the shore.\n\nHe did not know what had happened, nor did he pause to think: he was\nfleeing from horror—nameless horror; whilst the child at his feet,\nwith her head resting against the gunwale, stared up open-eyed and\nspeechless at the great blue sky, as if at some terror visible there.\nThe boat grounded on the white sand, and the wash of the incoming tide\ndrove it up sideways.\n\nEmmeline had fallen forward; she had lost consciousness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nALONE\n\nThe idea of spiritual life must be innate in the heart of man, for all\nthat terrible night, when the children lay huddled together in the\nlittle hut in the chapparel, the fear that filled them was that their\nold friend might suddenly darken the entrance and seek to lie down\nbeside them.\n\nThey did not speak about him. Something had been done to him; something\nhad happened. Something terrible had happened to the world they knew.\nBut they dared not speak of it or question each other.\n\nDick had carried his companion to the hut when he left the boat, and\nhidden with her there; the evening had come on, and the night, and now\nin the darkness, without having tasted food all day, he was telling her\nnot to be afraid, that he would take care of her. But not a word of\nthe thing that had happened.\n\nThe thing, for them, had no precedent, and no vocabulary. They had come\nacross death raw and real, uncooked by religion, undeodorised by the\nsayings of sages and poets.\n\nThey knew nothing of the philosophy that tells us that death is the\ncommon lot, and the natural sequence to birth, or the religion that\nteaches us that Death is the door to Life.\n\nA dead old sailor-man lying like a festering carcass on a coral ledge,\neyes staring and glazed and fixed, a wide-open mouth that once had\nspoken comforting words, and now spoke living crabs.\n\nThat was the vision before them. They did not philosophise about it;\nand though they were filled with terror, I do not think it was terror\nthat held them from speaking about it, but a vague feeling that what\nthey had beheld was obscene, unspeakable, and a thing to avoid.\n\nLestrange had brought them up in his own way. He had told them there\nwas a good God who looked after the world; determined as far as he\ncould to exclude demonology and sin and death from their knowledge, he\nhad rested content with the bald statement that there was a good God\nwho looked after the world, without explaining fully that the same God\nwould torture them for ever and ever, should they fail to believe in\nHim or keep His commandments.\n\nThis knowledge of the Almighty, therefore, was but a half knowledge,\nthe vaguest abstraction. Had they been brought up, however, in the most\nstrictly Calvinistic school, this knowledge of Him would have been no\ncomfort now. Belief in God is no comfort to a frightened child. Teach\nhim as many parrot-like prayers as you please, and in distress or the\ndark of what use are they to him? His cry is for his nurse, or his\nmother.\n\nDuring that dreadful night these two children had no comfort to seek\nanywhere in the whole wide universe but in each other. She, in a sense\nof his protection, he, in a sense of being her protector. The\nmanliness in him greater and more beautiful than physical strength,\ndeveloped in those dark hours just as a plant under extraordinary\ncircumstances is hurried into bloom.\n\nTowards dawn Emmeline fell asleep. Dick stole out of the hut when he\nhad assured himself from her regular breathing that she was asleep,\nand, pushing the tendrils and the branches of the mammee apples aside,\nfound the beach. The dawn was just breaking, and the morning breeze was\ncoming in from the sea.\n\nWhen he had beached the dinghy the day before, the tide was just at the\nflood, and it had left her stranded. The tide was coming in now, and in\na short time it would be far enough up to push her off.\n\nEmmeline in the night had implored him to take her away. Take her away\nsomewhere from there, and he had promised, without knowing in the least\nhow he was to perform his promise. As he stood looking at the beach, so\ndesolate and strangely different now from what it was the day before,\nan idea of how he could fulfil his promise came to him. He ran down to\nwhere the little boat lay on the shelving sand, with the ripples of the\nincoming tide just washing the rudder, which was still shipped. He\nunshipped the rudder and came back.\n\nUnder a tree, covered with the stay-sail they had brought from the\n_Shenandoah_, lay most of their treasures: old clothes and boots, and all\nthe other odds and ends. The precious tobacco stitched up in a piece of\ncanvas was there, and the housewife with the needles and threads. A\nhole had been dug in the sand as a sort of _cache_ for them, and the\nstay-sail put over them to protect them from the dew.\n\nThe sun was now looking over the sea-line, and the tall cocoa-nut trees\nwere singing and whispering together under the strengthening breeze.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nTHEY MOVE AWAY\n\nHe began to collect the things, and carry them to the dinghy. He took\nthe stay-sail and everything that might be useful; and when he had\nstowed them in the boat, he took the breaker and filled it with water\nat the water source in the wood; he collected some bananas and\nbreadfruit, and stowed them in the dinghy with the breaker. Then he\nfound the remains of yesterday’s breakfast, which he had hidden between\ntwo palmetto leaves, and placed it also in the boat.\n\nThe water was now so high that a strong push would float her. He turned\nback to the hut for Emmeline. She was still asleep: so soundly asleep,\nthat when he lifted her up in his arms she made no movement. He placed\nher carefully in the stern-sheets with her head on the sail rolled up,\nand then standing in the bow pushed off with a scull. Then, taking the\nsculls, he turned the boat’s head up the lagoon to the left. He kept\nclose to the shore, but for the life of him he could not help lifting\nhis eyes and looking towards the reef.\n\nRound a certain spot on the distant white coral there was a great\ncommotion of birds. Huge birds some of them seemed, and the “Hi! hi!\nhi!” of them came across the lagoon on the breeze as they quarrelled\ntogether and beat the air with their wings. He turned his head away\ntill a bend of the shore hid the spot from sight.\n\nHere, sheltered more completely than opposite the break in the reef,\nthe artu trees came in places right down to the water’s edge; the\nbreadfruit trees cast the shadow of their great scalloped leaves upon\nthe water; glades, thick with fern, wildernesses of the mammee apple,\nand bushes of the scarlet “wild cocoa-nut” all slipped by, as the\ndinghy, hugging the shore, crept up the lagoon.\n\nGazing at the shore edge one might have imagined it the edge of a lake,\nbut for the thunder of the Pacific upon the distant reef; and even that\ndid not destroy the impression, but only lent a strangeness to it.\n\nA lake in the midst of the ocean, that is what the lagoon really was.\n\nHere and there cocoa-nut trees slanted over the water, mirroring their\ndelicate stems, and tracing their clear-cut shadows on the sandy bottom\na fathom deep below.\n\nHe kept close in-shore for the sake of the shelter of the trees. His\nobject was to find some place where they might stop permanently, and\nput up a tent. He was seeking a new home, in fact. But, pretty as were\nthe glades they passed, they were not attractive places to live in.\nThere were too many trees, or the ferns were too deep. He was seeking\nair and space, and suddenly he found it. Rounding a little cape, all\nblazing with the scarlet of the wild cocoa-nut, the dinghy broke into a\nnew world.\n\nBefore her lay a great sweep of the palest blue wind-swept water, down\nto which came a broad green sward of park-like land set on either side\nwith deep groves, and leading up and away to higher land, where, above\nthe massive and motionless green of the great breadfruit trees, the\npalm trees swayed and fluttered their pale green feathers in the\nbreeze. The pale colour of the water was due to the extreme shallowness\nof the lagoon just here. So shallow was it that one could see brown\nspaces indicating beds of dead and rotten coral, and splashes of\ndarkest sapphire where the deep pools lay. The reef lay more than half\na mile from the shore: a great way out, it seemed, so far out that its\ncramping influence was removed, and one had the impression of wide and\nunbroken sea.\n\nDick rested on his oars, and let the dinghy float whilst he looked\naround him. He had come some four miles and a half, and this was right\nat the back of the island. As the boat drifting shoreward touched the\nbank, Emmeline awakened from her sleep, sat up, and looked around her.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II\n\n\nPART I\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nUNDER THE ARTU TREE\n\nOn the edge of the green sward, between a diamond-chequered artu trunk\nand the massive bole of a breadfruit, a house had come into being. It\nwas not much larger than a big hen-house, but quite sufficient for the\nneeds of two people in a climate of eternal summer. It was built of\nbamboos, and thatched with a double thatch of palmetto leaves, so\nneatly built, and so well thatched, that one might have fancied it the\nproduction of several skilled workmen.\n\nThe breadfruit tree was barren of fruit, as these trees sometimes are,\nwhole groves of them ceasing to bear for some mysterious reason only\nknown to Nature. It was green now, but when suffering its yearly change\nthe great scalloped leaves would take all imaginable tinges of gold and\nbronze and amber. Beyond the artu was a little clearing, where the\nchapparel had been carefully removed and taro roots planted.\n\nStepping from the house doorway on to the sward you might have fancied\nyourself, except for the tropical nature of the foliage, in some\nEnglish park.\n\nLooking to the right, the eye became lost in the woods, where all tints\nof green were tinging the foliage, and the bushes of the wild cocoa-nut\nburned scarlet as haw-berries.\n\nThe house had a doorway, but no door. It might have been said to have a\ndouble roof, for the breadfruit foliage above gave good shelter during\nthe rains. Inside it was bare enough. Dried, sweet-smelling ferns\ncovered the floor. Two sails, rolled up, lay on either side of the\ndoorway. There was a rude shelf attached to one of the walls, and on\nthe shelf some bowls made of cocoa-nut shell. The people to whom the\nplace belonged evidently did not trouble it much with their presence,\nusing it only at night, and as a refuge from the dew.\n\nSitting on the grass by the doorway, sheltered by the breadfruit shade,\nyet with the hot rays of the afternoon sun just touching her naked\nfeet, was a girl. A girl of fifteen or sixteen, naked, except for a\nkilt of gaily-striped material reaching from her waist to her knees.\nHer long black hair was drawn back from the forehead, and tied behind\nwith a loop of the elastic vine. A scarlet blossom was stuck behind her\nright ear, after the fashion of a clerk’s pen. Her face was beautiful,\npowdered with tiny freckles; especially under the eyes, which were of a\ndeep, tranquil blue-grey. She half sat, half lay on her left side;\nwhilst before her, quite close, strutted up and down on the grass, a\nbird, with blue plumage, coral-red beak, and bright, watchful eyes.\n\nThe girl was Emmeline Lestrange. Just by her elbow stood a little bowl\nmade from half a cocoa-nut, and filled with some white substance with\nwhich she was feeding the bird. Dick had found it in the woods two\nyears ago, quite small, deserted by its mother, and starving. They had\nfed it and tamed it, and it was now one of the family; roosting on the\nroof at night, and appearing regularly at meal times.\n\nAll at once she held out her hand; the bird flew into the air, lit on\nher forefinger and balanced itself, sinking its head between its\nshoulders, and uttering the sound which formed its entire vocabulary\nand one means of vocal expression—a sound from which it had derived\nits name.\n\n“Koko,” said Emmeline, “where is Dick?”\n\nThe bird turned his head about, as if he were searching for his master;\nand the girl lay back lazily on the grass, laughing, and holding him up\npoised on her finger, as if he were some enamelled jewel she wished to\nadmire at a little distance. They made a pretty picture under the\ncave-like shadow of the breadfruit leaves; and it was difficult to\nunderstand how this young girl, so perfectly formed, so fully\ndeveloped, and so beautiful, had evolved from plain little Emmeline\nLestrange. And the whole thing, as far as the beauty of her was\nconcerned, had happened during the last six months.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nHALF CHILD—HALF SAVAGE\n\nFive rainy seasons had passed and gone since the tragic occurrence on\nthe reef. Five long years the breakers had thundered, and the sea-gulls\nhad cried round the figure whose spell had drawn a mysterious barrier\nacross the lagoon.\n\nThe children had never returned to the old place. They had kept\nentirely to the back of the island and the woods—the lagoon, down to a\ncertain point, and the reef; a wide enough and beautiful enough world,\nbut a hopeless world, as far as help from civilisation was concerned.\nFor, of the few ships that touched at the island in the course of\nyears, how many would explore the lagoon or woods? Perhaps not one.\n\nOccasionally Dick would make an excursion in the dinghy to the old\nplace, but Emmeline refused to accompany him. He went chiefly to obtain\nbananas; for on the whole island there was but one clump of banana\ntrees—that near the water source in the wood, where the old green\nskulls had been discovered, and the little barrel.\n\nShe had never quite recovered from the occurrence on the reef.\nSomething had been shown to her, the purport of which she vaguely\nunderstood, and it had filled her with horror and a terror of the place\nwhere it had occurred. Dick was quite different. He had been frightened\nenough at first; but the feeling wore away in time.\n\nDick had built three houses in succession during the five years. He had\nlaid out a patch of taro and another of sweet potatoes. He knew every\npool on the reef for two miles either way, and the forms of their\ninhabitants; and though he did not know the names of the creatures to\nbe found there, he made a profound study of their habits.\n\nHe had seen some astonishing things during these five years—from a\nfight between a whale and two thrashers conducted outside the reef,\nlasting an hour, and dyeing the breaking waves with blood, to the\npoisoning of the fish in the lagoon by fresh water, due to an\nextraordinarily heavy rainy season.\n\nHe knew the woods of the back of the island by heart, and the forms of\nlife that inhabited them—butterflies, and moths, and birds, lizards,\nand insects of strange shape; extraordinary orchids—some\nfilthy-looking, the very image of corruption, some beautiful, and all\nstrange. He found melons and guavas, and breadfruit, the red apple of\nTahiti, and the great Brazilian plum, taro in plenty, and a dozen\nother good things—but there were no bananas. This made him unhappy\nat times, for he was human.\n\nThough Emmeline had asked Koko for Dick’s whereabouts, it was only a\nremark made by way of making conversation, for she could hear him in\nthe little cane-brake which lay close by amidst the trees.\n\nIn a few minutes he appeared, dragging after him two canes which he had\njust cut, and wiping the perspiration off his brow with his naked arm.\nHe had an old pair of trousers on—part of the truck salved long ago\nfrom the _Shenandoah_—nothing else, and he was well worth looking at and\nconsidering, both from a physical and psychological point of view.\n\nAuburn-haired and tall, looking more like seventeen than sixteen, with\na restless and daring expression, half a child, half a man, half a\ncivilised being, half a savage, he had both progressed and retrograded\nduring the five years of savage life. He sat down beside Emmeline,\nflung the canes beside him, tried the edge of the old butcher’s knife\nwith which he had cut them, then, taking one of the canes across his\nknee, he began whittling at it.\n\n“What are you making?” asked Emmeline, releasing the bird, which flew\ninto one of the branches of the artu and rested there, a blue point\namidst the dark green.\n\n“Fish-spear,” replied Dick.\n\nWithout being taciturn, he rarely wasted words. Life was all business\nfor him. He would talk to Emmeline, but always in short sentences; and\nhe had developed the habit of talking to inanimate things, to the\nfish-spear he was carving, or the bowl he was fashioning from a\ncocoa-nut.\n\nAs for Emmeline, even as a child she had never been talkative. There\nwas something mysterious in her personality, something secretive. Her\nmind seemed half submerged in twilight. Though she spoke little, and\nthough the subject of their conversations was almost entirely material\nand relative to their everyday needs, her mind would wander into\nabstract fields and the land of chimerae and dreams. What she found\nthere no one knew—least of all, perhaps, herself.\n\nAs for Dick, he would sometimes talk and mutter to himself, as if in a\nreverie; but if you caught the words, you would find that they referred\nto no abstraction, but to some trifle he had on hand. He seemed\nentirely bound up in the moment, and to have forgotten the past as\ncompletely as though it had never been.\n\nYet he had his contemplative moods. He would lie with his face over a\nrock-pool by the hour, watching the strange forms of life to be seen\nthere, or sit in the woods motionless as a stone, watching the birds\nand the swift-slipping lizards. The birds came so close that he could\neasily have knocked them over, but he never hurt one or interfered in\nany way with the wild life of the woods.\n\nThe island, the lagoon, and the reef were for him the three volumes of\na great picture book, as they were for Emmeline, though in a different\nmanner. The colour and the beauty of it all fed some mysterious want in\nher soul. Her life was a long reverie, a beautiful vision—troubled\nwith shadows. Across all the blue and coloured spaces that meant months\nand years she could still see as in a glass dimly the _Northumberland_,\nsmoking against the wild background of fog; her uncle’s face, Boston—a\nvague and dark picture beyond a storm—and nearer, the tragic form on\nthe reef that still haunted terribly her dreams. But she never spoke of\nthese things to Dick. Just as she kept the secret of what was in her\nbox, and the secret of her trouble whenever she lost it, she kept the\nsecret of her feelings about these things.\n\nBorn of these things there remained with her always a vague terror: the\nterror of losing Dick. Mrs Stannard, her uncle, the dim people she had\nknown in Boston, all had passed away out of her life like a dream and\nshadows. The other one too, most horribly. What if Dick were taken\nfrom her as well?\n\nThis haunting trouble had been with her a long time; up to a few months\nago it had been mainly personal and selfish—the dread of being left\nalone. But lately it had altered and become more acute. Dick had\nchanged in her eyes, and the fear was now for him. Her own personality\nhad suddenly and strangely become merged in his. The idea of life\nwithout him was unthinkable, yet the trouble remained, a menace in the\nblue.\n\nSome days it would be worse than others. To-day, for instance, it was\nworse than yesterday, as though some danger had crept close to them\nduring the night. Yet the sky and sea were stainless, the sun shone on\ntree and flower, the west wind brought the tune of the far-away reef\nlike a lullaby. There was nothing to hint of danger or the need of\ndistrust.\n\nAt last Dick finished his spear and rose to his feet.\n\n“Where are you going?” asked Emmeline.\n\n“The reef,” he replied. “The tide’s going out.”\n\n“I’ll go with you,” said she.\n\nHe went into the house and stowed the precious knife away. Then he came\nout, spear in one hand, and half a fathom of liana in the other. The\nliana was for the purpose of stringing the fish on, should the catch be\nlarge. He led the way down the grassy sward to the lagoon where the\ndinghy lay, close up to the bank, and moored to a post driven into the\nsoft soil. Emmeline got in, and, taking the sculls, he pushed off. The\ntide was going out.\n\nI have said that the reef just here lay a great way out from the shore.\nThe lagoon was so shallow that at low tide one could have waded almost\nright across it, were it not for pot-holes here and there—ten-feet\ntraps—and great beds of rotten coral, into which one would sink as\ninto brushwood, to say nothing of the nettle coral that stings like a\nbed of nettles. There were also other dangers. Tropical shallows are\nfull of wild surprises in the way of life—and death.\n\nDick had long ago marked out in his memory the soundings of the lagoon,\nand it was fortunate that he possessed the special sense of location\nwhich is the main stand-by of the hunter and the savage, for, from the\ndisposition of the coral in ribs, the water from the shore edge to the\nreef ran in lanes. Only two of these lanes gave a clear, fair way from\nthe shore edge to the reef; had you followed the others, even in a boat\nof such shallow draught as the dinghy, you would have found yourself\nstranded half-way across, unless, indeed, it were a spring tide.\n\nHalf-way across the sound of the surf on the barrier became louder, and\nthe everlasting and monotonous cry of the gulls came on the breeze. It\nwas lonely out here, and, looking back, the shore seemed a great way\noff. It was lonelier still on the reef.\n\nDick tied up the boat to a projection of coral, and helped Emmeline to\nland. The sun was creeping down into the west, the tide was nearly half\nout, and large pools of water lay glittering like burnished shields in\nthe sunlight. Dick, with his precious spear beside him, sat calmly down\non a ledge of coral, and began to divest himself of his one and only\ngarment.\n\nEmmeline turned away her head and contemplated the distant shore, which\nseemed thrice as far off as it was in reality. When she turned her head\nagain he was racing along the edge of the surf. He and his spear\nsilhouetted against the spindrift and dazzling foam formed a picture\nsavage enough, and well in keeping with the general desolation of the\nbackground. She watched him lie down and cling to a piece of coral,\nwhilst the surf rushed round and over him, and then rise and shake\nhimself like a dog, and pursue his gambols, his body all glittering\nwith the wet.\n\nSometimes a whoop would come on the breeze, mixing with the sound of\nthe surf and the cry of the gulls, and she would see him plunge his\nspear into a pool, and the next moment the spear would be held aloft\nwith something struggling and glittering at the end of it.\n\nHe was quite different out here on the reef to what he was ashore. The\nsurroundings here seemed to develop all that was savage in him, in a\nstartling way; and he would kill, and kill, just for the pleasure of\nkilling, destroying more fish than they could possibly use.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE DEMON OF THE REEF\n\nThe romance of coral has still to be written. There still exists a\nwidespread opinion that the coral reef and the coral island are the\nwork of an “insect.” This fabulous insect, accredited with the genius\nof Brunel and the patience of Job, has been humorously enough held up\nbefore the children of many generations as an example of industry—a\nthing to be admired, a model to be followed.\n\nAs a matter of fact, nothing could be more slothful or slow, more given\nup to a life of ease and degeneracy, than the “reef-building\npolypifer”—to give him his scientific name. He is the hobo of the\nanimal world, but, unlike the hobo, he does not even tramp for a\nliving. He exists as a sluggish and gelatinous worm; he attracts to\nhimself calcareous elements from the water to make himself a\nhouse—mark you, the sea does the building—he dies, and he leaves his\nhouse behind him—and a reputation for industry, beside which the\nreputation of the ant turns pale, and that of the bee becomes of little\naccount.\n\nOn a coral reef you are treading on rock that the reef-building\npolypifers of ages have left behind them as evidences of their idle and\napparently useless lives. You might fancy that the reef is formed of\ndead rock, but it is not: that is where the wonder of the thing comes\nin—a coral reef is half alive. If it were not, it would not resist the\naction of the sea ten years. The live part of the reef is just where\nthe breakers come in and beyond. The gelatinous rock-building\npolypifers die almost at once, if exposed to the sun or if left\nuncovered by water.\n\nSometimes, at very low tide, if you have courage enough to risk being\nswept away by the breakers, going as far out on the reef as you can,\nyou may catch a glimpse of them in their living state—great mounds and\nmasses of what seems rock, but which is a honeycomb of coral, whose\ncells are filled with the living polypifers. Those in the uppermost\ncells are usually dead, but lower down they are living.\n\nAlways dying, always being renewed, devoured by fish, attacked by the\nsea—that is the life of a coral reef. It is a thing as living as a\ncabbage or a tree. Every storm tears a piece off the reef, which the\nliving coral replaces; wounds occur in it which actually granulate and\nheal as wounds do of the human body.\n\nThere is nothing, perhaps, more mysterious in nature than this fact of\nthe existence of a living land: a land that repairs itself, when\ninjured, by vital processes, and resists the eternal attack of the sea\nby vital force, especially when we think of the extent of some of these\nlagoon islands or atolls, whose existences are an eternal battle with\nthe waves.\n\nUnlike the island of this story (which is an island surrounded by a\nbarrier reef of coral surrounding a space of sea—the lagoon), the reef\nforms the island. The reef may be grown over by trees, or it may be\nperfectly destitute of important vegetation, or it may be crusted with\nislets. Some islets may exist within the lagoon, but as often as not it\nis just a great empty lake floored with sand and coral, peopled with\nlife different to the life of the outside ocean, protected from the\nwaves, and reflecting the sky like a mirror.\n\nWhen we remember that the atoll is a living thing, an organic whole, as\nfull of life, though not so highly organised, as a tortoise, the\nmeanest imagination must be struck with the immensity of one of the\nstructures.\n\nVliegen atoll in the Low Archipelago, measured from lagoon edge to\nlagoon edge, is sixty miles long by twenty miles broad, at its broadest\npart. In the Marshall Archipelago, Rimsky Korsacoff is fifty-four miles\nlong and twenty miles broad; and Rimsky Korsacoff is a living thing,\nsecreting, excreting, and growing—more highly organised than the\ncocoa-nut trees that grow upon its back, or the blossoms that powder\nthe hotoo trees in its groves.\n\nThe story of coral is the story of a world, and the longest chapter in\nthat story concerns itself with coral’s infinite variety and form.\n\nOut on the margin of the reef where Dick was spearing fish, you might\nhave seen a peach-blossom-coloured lichen on the rock. This lichen was\na form of coral. Coral growing upon coral, and in the pools at the edge\nof the surf branching corals also of the colour of a peach bloom.\n\nWithin a hundred yards of where Emmeline was sitting, the pools\ncontained corals of all colours, from lake-red to pure white, and the\nlagoon behind her—corals of the quaintest and strangest forms.\n\nDick had speared several fish, and had left them lying on the reef to\nbe picked up later on. Tired of killing, he was now wandering along,\nexamining the various living things he came across.\n\nHuge slugs inhabited the reef, slugs as big as parsnips, and somewhat\nof the same shape; they were a species of Bech de mer. Globe-shaped\njelly-fish as big as oranges, great cuttlefish bones flat and shining\nand white, shark’s teeth, spines of echini; sometimes a dead scarus\nfish, its stomach distended with bits of coral on which it had been\nfeeding; crabs, sea urchins, sea-weeds of strange colour and shape;\nstar-fish, some tiny and of the colour of cayenne pepper, some huge and\npale. These and a thousand other things, beautiful or strange, were to\nbe found on the reef.\n\nDick had laid his spear down, and was exploring a deep bath-like pool.\nHe had waded up to his knees, and was in the act of wading further when\nhe was suddenly seized by the foot. It was just as if his ankle had\nbeen suddenly caught in a clove hitch and the rope drawn tight. He\nscreamed out with pain and terror, and suddenly and viciously a\nwhip-lash shot out from the water, lassoed him round the left knee,\ndrew itself taut, and held him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nWHAT BEAUTY CONCEALED\n\nEmmeline, seated on the coral rock, had almost forgotten Dick for a\nmoment. The sun was setting, and the warm amber light of the sunset\nshone on reef and rock-pool. Just at sunset and low tide the reef had a\npeculiar fascination for her. It had the low-tide smell of sea-weed\nexposed to the air, and the torment and trouble of the breakers seemed\neased. Before her, and on either side, the foam-dashed coral glowed in\namber and gold, and the great Pacific came glassing and glittering in,\nvoiceless and peaceful, till it reached the strand and burst into song\nand spray.\n\nHere, just as on the hill-top at the other side of the island, you\ncould mark the rhythm of the rollers. “Forever, and forever—forever,\nand forever,” they seemed to say.\n\nThe cry of the gulls came mixed with the spray on the breeze. They\nhaunted the reef like uneasy spirits, always complaining, never at\nrest; but at sunset their cry seemed farther away and less melancholy,\nperhaps because just then the whole island world seemed bathed in the\nspirit of peace.\n\nShe turned from the sea prospect and looked backwards over the lagoon\nto the island. She could make out the broad green glade beside which\ntheir little house lay, and a spot of yellow, which was the thatch of\nthe house, just by the artu tree, and nearly hidden by the shadow of\nthe breadfruit. Over woods the fronds of the great cocoa-nut palms\nshowed above every other tree silhouetted against the dim, dark blue of\nthe eastern sky.\n\nSeen by the enchanted light of sunset, the whole picture had an unreal\nlook, more lovely than a dream. At dawn—and Dick would often start for\nthe reef before dawn, if the tide served—the picture was as beautiful;\nmore so, perhaps, for over the island, all in shadow, and against the\nstars, you would see the palm-tops catching fire, and then the light of\nday coming through the green trees and blue sky, like a spirit, across\nthe blue lagoon, widening and strengthening as it widened, across the\nwhite foam, out over the sea, spreading like a fan, till, all at once,\nnight was day, and the gulls were crying and the breakers flashing, the\ndawn wind blowing, and the palm trees bending, as palm trees only know\nhow. Emmeline always imagined herself alone on the island with Dick,\nbut beauty was there, too, and beauty is a great companion.\n\nThe girl was contemplating the scene before her. Nature in her\nfriendliest mood seemed to say, “Behold me! Men call me cruel; men have\ncalled me deceitful, even treacherous. _I_—ah well! my answer is,\n‘Behold me!’”\n\nThe girl was contemplating the specious beauty of it all, when on the\nbreeze from seaward came a shout. She turned quickly. There was Dick up\nto his knees in a rock-pool a hundred yards or so away, motionless, his\narms upraised, and crying out for help. She sprang to her feet.\n\nThere had once been an islet on this part of the reef, a tiny thing,\nconsisting of a few palms and a handful of vegetation, and destroyed,\nperhaps, in some great storm. I mention this because the existence of\nthis islet once upon a time was the means, indirectly, of saving Dick’s\nlife; for where these islets have been or are, “flats” occur on the\nreef formed of coral conglomerate.\n\nEmmeline in her bare feet could never have reached him in time over\nrough coral, but, fortunately, this flat and comparatively smooth\nsurface lay between them.\n\n“My spear!” shouted Dick, as she approached.\n\nHe seemed at first tangled in brambles; then she thought ropes were\ntangling round him and tying him to something in the water—whatever it\nwas, it was most awful, and hideous, and like a nightmare. She ran with\nthe speed of Atalanta to the rock where the spear was resting, all red\nwith the blood of new-slain fish, a foot from the point.\n\nAs she approached Dick, spear in hand, she saw, gasping with terror,\nthat the ropes were alive, and that they were flickering and rippling\nover his back. One of them bound his left arm to his side, but his\nright arm was free.\n\n“Quick!” he shouted.\n\nIn a second the spear was in his free hand, and Emmeline had cast\nherself down on her knees, and was staring with terrified eyes into the\nwater of the pool from whence the ropes issued. She was, despite her\nterror, quite prepared to fling herself in and do battle with the\nthing, whatever it might be.\n\nWhat she saw was only for a second. In the deep water of the pool,\ngazing up and forward and straight at Dick, she saw a face, lugubrious\nand awful. The eyes were wide as saucers, stony and steadfast; a large,\nheavy, parrot-like beak hung before the eyes, and worked and wobbled,\nand seemed to beckon. But what froze one’s heart was the expression of\nthe eyes, so stony and lugubrious, so passionless, so devoid of\nspeculation, yet so fixed of purpose and full of fate.\n\nFrom away far down he had risen with the rising tide. He had been\nfeeding on crabs, when the tide, betraying him, had gone out, leaving\nhim trapped in the rock-pool. He had slept, perhaps, and awakened to\nfind a being, naked and defenceless, invading his pool. He was quite\nsmall, as octopods go, and young, yet he was large and powerful enough\nto have drowned an ox.\n\nThe octopod has only been described once, in stone, by a Japanese\nartist. The statue is still extant, and it is the most terrible\nmasterpiece of sculpture ever executed by human hands. It represents a\nman who has been bathing on a low-tide beach, and has been caught. The\nman is shouting in a delirium of terror, and threatening with his free\narm the spectre that has him in its grip. The eyes of the octopod are\nfixed upon the man—passionless and lugubrious eyes, but steadfast and\nfixed.\n\nAnother whip-lash shot out of the water in a shower of spray, and\nseized Dick by the left thigh. At the same instant he drove the point\nof the spear through the right eye of the monster, deep down through\neye and soft gelatinous carcass till the spear-point dirled and\nsplintered against the rock. At the same moment the water of the pool\nbecame black as ink, the bands around him relaxed, and he was free.\n\nEmmeline rose up and seized him, sobbing and clinging to him, and\nkissing him. He clasped her with his left arm round her body, as if to\nprotect her, but it was a mechanical action. He was not thinking of\nher. Wild with rage, and uttering hoarse cries, he plunged the broken\nspear again and again into the depths of the pool, seeking utterly to\ndestroy the enemy that had so lately had him in its grip. Then slowly\nhe came to himself, and wiped his forehead, and looked at the broken\nspear in his hand.\n\n“Beast!” he said. “Did you see its eyes? Did you see its eyes? I wish\nit had a hundred eyes, and I had a hundred spears to drive into them!”\n\nShe was clinging to him, and sobbing and laughing hysterically, and\npraising him. One might have thought that he had rescued her from\ndeath, not she him.\n\nThe sun had nearly vanished, and he led her back to where the dinghy\nwas moored recapturing and putting on his trousers on the road. He\npicked up the dead fish he had speared; and as he rowed her back across\nthe lagoon, he talked and laughed, recounting the incidents of the\nfight, taking all the glory of the thing to himself, and seeming quite\nto ignore the important part she had played in it.\n\nThis was not from any callousness or want of gratitude, but simply from\nthe fact that for the last five years he had been the be-all and\nend-all of their tiny community—the Imperial master. And he would\njust as soon have thought of thanking her for handing him the spear as\nof thanking his right hand for driving it home. She was quite content,\nseeking neither thanks nor praise. Everything she had came from him:\nshe was his shadow and his slave. He was her sun.\n\nHe went over the fight again and again before they lay down to rest,\ntelling her he had done this and that, and what he would do to the next\nbeast of the sort. The reiteration was tiresome enough, or would have\nbeen to an outside listener, but to Emmeline it was better than Homer.\nPeople’s minds do not improve in an intellectual sense when they are\nisolated from the world, even though they are living the wild and happy\nlives of savages.\n\nThen Dick lay down in the dried ferns and covered himself with a piece\nof the striped flannel which they used for blanketing, and he snored,\nand chattered in his sleep like a dog hunting imaginary game, and\nEmmeline lay beside him wakeful and thinking. A new terror had come\ninto her life. She had seen death for the second time, but this time\nactive and in being.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE SOUND OF A DRUM\n\nThe next day Dick was sitting under the shade of the artu. He had the\nbox of fishhooks beside him, and he was bending a line on to one of\nthem. There had originally been a couple of dozen hooks, large and\nsmall, in the box; there remained now only six—four small and two\nlarge ones. It was a large one he was fixing to the line, for he\nintended going on the morrow to the old place to fetch some bananas,\nand on the way to try for a fish in the deeper parts of the lagoon.\n\nIt was late afternoon, and the heat had gone out of the day. Emmeline,\nseated on the grass opposite to him, was holding the end of the line,\nwhilst he got the kinks out of it, when suddenly she raised her head.\n\nThere was not a breath of wind; the hush of the far-distant surf came\nthrough the blue weather—the only audible sound except, now and then,\na movement and flutter from the bird perched in the branches of the\nartu. All at once another sound mixed itself with the voice of the\nsurf—a faint, throbbing sound, like the beating of a distant drum.\n\n“Listen!” said Emmeline.\n\nDick paused for a moment in his work. All the sounds of the island were\nfamiliar: this was something quite strange.\n\nFaint and far away, now rapid, now slow; coming from where, who could\nsay? Sometimes it seemed to come from the sea, sometimes, if the fancy\nof the listener turned that way, from the woods. As they listened, a\nsigh came from overhead; the evening breeze had risen and was moving in\nthe leaves of the artu tree. Just as you might wipe a picture off a\nslate, the breeze banished the sound. Dick went on with his work.\n\nNext morning early he embarked in the dinghy. He took the hook and line\nwith him, and some raw fish for bait. Emmeline helped him to push off,\nand stood on the bank waving her hand as he rounded the little cape\ncovered with wild cocoa-nut.\n\nThese expeditions of Dick’s were one of her sorrows. To be left alone\nwas frightful; yet she never complained. She was living in a paradise,\nbut something told her that behind all that sun, all that splendour of\nblue sea and sky, behind the flowers and the leaves, behind all that\nspecious and simpering appearance of happiness in nature, lurked a\nfrown, and the dragon of mischance.\n\nDick rowed for about a mile, then he shipped his sculls, and let the\ndinghy float. The water here was very deep; so deep that, despite its\nclearness, the bottom was invisible; the sunlight over the reef struck\nthrough it diagonally, filling it with sparkles.\n\nThe fisherman baited his hook with a piece from the belly of a scarus\nand lowered it down out of sight, then he belayed the line to a thole\npin, and, sitting in the bottom of the boat, hung his head over the\nside and gazed deep down into the water. Sometimes there was nothing to\nsee but just the deep blue of the water. Then a flight of spangled\narrowheads would cross the line of sight and vanish, pursued by a form\nlike a moving bar of gold. Then a great fish would materialise itself\nand hang in the shadow of the boat motionless as a stone, save for the\nmovement of its gills; next moment with a twist of the tail it would be\ngone.\n\nSuddenly the dinghy shored over, and might have capsized, only for the\nfact that Dick was sitting on the opposite side to the side from which\nthe line hung. Then the boat righted; the line slackened, and the\nsurface of the lagoon, a few fathoms away, boiled as if being stirred\nfrom below by a great silver stick. He had hooked an albicore. He tied\nthe end of the fishing-line to a scull, undid the line from the thole\npin, and flung the scull overboard.\n\nHe did all this with wonderful rapidity, while the line was still\nslack. Next moment the scull was rushing over the surface of the\nlagoon, now towards the reef, now towards the shore, now flat, now end\nup. Now it would be jerked under the surface entirely; vanish for a\nmoment, and then reappear. It was a most astonishing thing to watch,\nfor the scull seemed alive—viciously alive, and imbued with some\ndestructive purpose; as, in fact, it was. The most venomous of living\nthings, and the most intelligent could not have fought the great fish\nbetter.\n\nThe albicore would make a frantic dash down the lagoon, hoping,\nperhaps, to find in the open sea a release from his foe. Then, half\ndrowned with the pull of the scull, he would pause, dart from side to\nside in perplexity, and then make an equally frantic dash up the\nlagoon, to be checked in the same manner. Seeking the deepest depths,\nhe would sink the scull a few fathoms; and once he sought the air,\nleaping into the sunlight like a crescent of silver, whilst the splash\nof him as he fell echoed amidst the trees bordering the lagoon. An hour\npassed before the great fish showed signs of weakening.\n\nThe struggle had taken place up to this close to the shore, but now the\nscull swam out into the broad sheet of sunlit water, and slowly began\nto describe large circles rippling up the peaceful blue into flashing\nwavelets. It was a melancholy sight to watch, for the great fish had\nmade a good fight, and one could see him, through the eye of\nimagination, beaten, half drowned, dazed, and moving as is the fashion\nof dazed things in a circle.\n\nDick, working the remaining oar at the stern of the boat, rowed out and\nseized the floating scull, bringing it on board. Foot by foot he hauled\nhis catch towards the boat till the long gleaming line of the thing\ncame dimly into view.\n\nThe fight had been heard for miles through the lagoon water by all\nsorts of swimming things. The lord of the place had got sound of it. A\ndark fin rippled the water; and as Dick, pulling on his line, hauled\nhis catch closer, a monstrous grey shadow stained the depths, and the\nglittering streak that was the albicore vanished as if engulfed in a\ncloud. The line came in slack, and Dick hauled in the albicore’s head.\nIt had been divided from the body as if with a huge pair of shears. The\ngrey shadow slipped by the boat, and Dick, mad with rage, shouted and\nshook his fist at it; then, seizing the albicore’s head, from which he\nhad taken the hook, he hurled it at the monster in the water.\n\nThe great shark, with a movement of the tail that caused the water to\nswirl and the dinghy to rock, turned upon his back and engulfed the\nhead; then he slowly sank and vanished, just as if he had been\ndissolved. He had come off best in this their first encounter—such as\nit was.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nSAILS UPON THE SEA\n\nDick put the hook away and took to the sculls. He had a three-mile row\nbefore him, and the tide was coming in, which did not make it any the\neasier. As he rowed, he talked and grumbled to himself. He had been in\na grumbling mood for some time past: the chief cause, Emmeline.\n\nIn the last few months she had changed; even her face had changed. A\nnew person had come upon the island, it seemed to him, and taken the\nplace of the Emmeline he had known from earliest childhood. This one\nlooked different. He did not know that she had grown beautiful, he just\nknew that she looked different; also she had developed new ways that\ndispleased him—she would go off and bathe by herself, for instance.\n\nUp to six months or so ago he had been quite contented; sleeping and\neating, and hunting for food and cooking it, building and rebuilding\nthe house, exploring the woods and the reef. But lately a spirit of\nrestlessness had come upon him; he did not know exactly what he wanted.\nHe had a vague feeling that he wanted to go away from the place where\nhe was; not from the island, but from the place where they had pitched\ntheir tent, or rather built their house.\n\nIt may have been the spirit of civilisation crying out in him, telling\nhim of all he was missing. Of the cities, and the streets, and the\nhouses, and the businesses, and the striving after gold, the striving\nafter power. It may have been simply the man in him crying out for\nLove, and not knowing yet that Love was at his elbow.\n\nThe dinghy glided along, hugging the shore, past the little glades of\nfern and the cathedral gloom of the breadfruit; then, rounding a\npromontory, she opened the view of the break in the reef. A little bit\nof the white strand was visible, but he was not looking that way—he\nwas looking towards the reef at a tiny, dark spot, not noticeable\nunless searched for by the eye. Always when he came on these\nexpeditions, just here, he would hang on his oars and gaze over there,\nwhere the gulls were flying and the breakers thundering.\n\nA few years ago the spot filled him with dread as well as curiosity,\nbut from familiarity and the dullness that time casts on everything,\nthe dread had almost vanished, but the curiosity remained: the\ncuriosity that makes a child look on at the slaughter of an animal even\nthough his soul revolts at it. He gazed for a while, then he went on\npulling, and the dinghy approached the beach.\n\nSomething had happened on the beach. The sand was all trampled, and\nstained red here and there; in the centre lay the remains of a great\nfire still smouldering, and just where the water lapped the sand, lay\ntwo deep grooves as if two heavy boats had been beached there. A South\nSea man would have told from the shape of the grooves, and the little\nmarks of the out-riggers, that two heavy canoes had been beached there.\nAnd they had.\n\nThe day before, early in the afternoon, two canoes, possibly from that\nfar-away island which cast a stain on the horizon to the\nsou’-sou’-west, had entered the lagoon, one in pursuit of the other.\n\nWhat happened then had better be left veiled. A war drum with a\nshark-skin head had set the woods throbbing; the victory was celebrated\nall night, and at dawn the victors manned the two canoes and set sail\nfor the home, or the hell, they had come from. Had you examined the\nstrand you would have found that a line had been drawn across the\nbeach, beyond which there were no footmarks: that meant that the rest\nof the island was for some reason _tabu_.\n\nDick pulled the nose of the boat up a bit on the strand, then he looked\naround him. He picked up a broken spear that had been cast away or\nforgotten; it was made of some hard wood and barbed with iron. On the\nright-hand side of the beach something lay between the cocoa-nut trees.\nHe approached; it was a mass of offal; the entrails of a dozen sheep\nseemed cast here in one mound, yet there were no sheep on the island,\nand sheep are not carried as a rule in war canoes.\n\nThe sand on the beach was eloquent. The foot pursuing and the foot\npursued; the knee of the fallen one, and then the forehead and\noutspread hands; the heel of the chief who has slain his enemy, beaten\nthe body flat, burst a hole through it through which he has put his\nhead, and who stands absolutely wearing his enemy as a cloak; the head\nof the man dragged on his back to be butchered like a sheep—of these\nthings spoke the sand.\n\nAs far as the sand traces could speak, the story of the battle was\nstill being told; the screams and the shouting, the clashing of clubs\nand spears were gone, yet the ghost of the fight remained.\n\nIf the sand could bear such traces, and tell such tales, who shall say\nthat the plastic æther was destitute of the story of the fight and the\nbutchery?\n\nHowever that may have been, Dick, looking around him, had the shivering\nsense of having just escaped from danger. Whoever had been, had\ngone—he could tell that by the canoe traces. Gone either out to sea,\nor up the right stretch of the lagoon. It was important to determine\nthis.\n\nHe climbed to the hill-top and swept the sea with his eyes. There, away\nto the south-west, far away on the sea, he could distinguish the brown\nsails of two canoes. There was something indescribably mournful and\nlonely in their appearance; they looked like withered leaves—brown\nmoths blown to sea—derelicts of autumn. Then, remembering the beach,\nthese things became freighted with the most sinister thoughts for the\nmind of the gazer. They were hurrying away, having done their work.\nThat they looked lonely and old and mournful, and like withered leaves\nblown across the sea, only heightened the horror.\n\nDick had never seen canoes before, but he knew that these things were\nboats of some sort holding people, and that the people had left all\nthose traces on the beach. How much of the horror of the thing was\nrevealed to his subconscious intelligence, who can say?\n\nHe had climbed the boulder, and he now sat down with his knees drawn\nup, and his hands clasped round them. Whenever he came round to this\nside of the island, something happened of a fateful or sinister nature.\nThe last time he had nearly lost the dinghy; he had beached the little\nboat in such a way that she floated off, and the tide was just in the\nact of stealing her, and sweeping her from the lagoon out to sea, when\nhe returned laden with his bananas, and, rushing into the water up to\nhis waist, saved her. Another time he had fallen out of a tree, and\njust by a miracle escaped death. Another time a hurricane had broken,\nlashing the lagoon into snow, and sending the cocoa-nuts bounding and\nflying like tennis balls across the strand. This time he had just\nescaped something, he knew not exactly what. It was almost as if\nProvidence were saying to him, “Don’t come here.”\n\nHe watched the brown sails as they dwindled in the wind-blown blue,\nthen he came down from the hill-top and cut his bananas. He cut four\nlarge bunches, which caused him to make two journeys to the boat. When\nthe bananas were stowed he pushed off.\n\nFor a long time a great curiosity had been pulling at his\nheart-strings: a curiosity of which he was dimly ashamed. Fear had\ngiven it birth, and Fear still clung to it. It was, perhaps, the\nelement of fear and the awful delight of daring the unknown that made\nhim give way to it.\n\nHe had rowed, perhaps, a hundred yards when he turned the boat’s head\nand made for the reef. It was more than five years since that day when\nhe rowed across the lagoon, Emmeline sitting in the stern, with her\nwreath of flowers in her hand. It might have been only yesterday, for\neverything seemed just the same. The thunderous surf and the flying\ngulls, the blinding sunlight, and the salt, fresh smell of the sea. The\npalm tree at the entrance of the lagoon still bent gazing into the\nwater, and round the projection of coral to which he had last moored\nthe boat still lay a fragment of the rope which he had cut in his hurry\nto escape.\n\nShips had come into the lagoon, perhaps, during the five years, but no\none had noticed anything on the reef, for it was only from the hill-top\nthat a full view of what was there could be seen, and then only by eyes\nknowing where to look. From the beach there was visible just a speck.\nIt might have been, perhaps, a bit of old wreckage flung there by a\nwave in some big storm. A piece of old wreckage that had been tossed\nhither and thither for years, and had at last found a place of rest.\n\nDick tied the boat up, and stepped on to the reef. It was high tide\njust as before; the breeze was blowing strongly, and overhead a\nman-of-war’s bird, black as ebony, with a blood-red bill, came sailing,\nthe wind doming out his wings. He circled in the air, and cried out\nfiercely, as if resenting the presence of the intruder, then he passed\naway, let himself be blown away, as it were, across the lagoon,\nwheeled, circled, and passed out to sea.\n\nDick approached the place he knew, and there lay the little old barrel\nall warped by the powerful sun; the staves stood apart, and the hooping\nwas rusted and broken, and whatever it had contained in the way of\nspirit and conviviality had long ago drained away.\n\nBeside the barrel lay a skeleton, round which lay a few rags of cloth.\nThe skull had fallen to one side, and the lower jaw had fallen from the\nskull; the bones of the hands and feet were still articulated, and the\nribs had not fallen in. It was all white and bleached, and the sun\nshone on it as indifferently as on the coral, this shell and framework\nthat had once been a man. There was nothing dreadful about it, but a\nwhole world of wonder.\n\nTo Dick, who had not been broken into the idea of death, who had not\nlearned to associate it with graves and funerals, sorrow, eternity, and\nhell, the thing spoke as it never could have spoken to you or me.\n\nLooking at it, things linked themselves together in his mind: the\nskeletons of birds he had found in the woods, the fish he had slain,\neven trees lying dead and rotten—even the shells of crabs.\n\nIf you had asked him what lay before him, and if he could have\nexpressed the thought in his mind, he would have answered you “change.”\n\nAll the philosophy in the world could not have told him more than he\nknew just then about death—he, who even did not know its name.\n\nHe was held spellbound by the marvel and miracle of the thing and the\nthoughts that suddenly crowded his mind like a host of spectres for\nwhom a door has just been opened.\n\nJust as a child by unanswerable logic knows that a fire which has\nburned him once will burn him again, or will burn another person, he\nknew that just as the form before him was, his form would be some\nday—and Emmeline’s.\n\nThen came the vague question which is born not of the brain, but the\nheart, and which is the basis of all religions—where shall I be then?\nHis mind was not of an introspective nature, and the question just\nstrayed across it and was gone. And still the wonder of the thing held\nhim. He was for the first time in his life in a reverie; the corpse\nthat had shocked and terrified him five years ago had cast seeds of\nthought with its dead fingers upon his mind, the skeleton had brought\nthem to maturity. The full fact of universal death suddenly appeared\nbefore him, and he recognised it.\n\nHe stood for a long time motionless, and then with a deep sigh turned\nto the boat and pushed off without once looking back at the reef. He\ncrossed the lagoon and rowed slowly homewards, keeping in the shelter\nof the tree shadows as much as possible.\n\nEven looking at him from the shore you might have noticed a difference\nin him. Your savage paddles his canoe, or sculls his boat, alert,\nglancing about him, at touch with nature at all points; though he be\nlazy as a cat and sleeps half the day, awake he is all ears and eyes—a\ncreature reacting to the least external impression.\n\nDick, as he rowed back, did not look about him: he was thinking or\nretrospecting. The savage in him had received a check. As he turned the\nlittle cape where the wild cocoa-nut blazed, he looked over his\nshoulder. A figure was standing on the sward by the edge of the water.\nIt was Emmeline.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE SCHOONER\n\nThey carried the bananas up to the house, and hung them from a branch\nof the artu. Then Dick, on his knees, lit the fire to prepare the\nevening meal. When it was over he went down to where the boat was\nmoored, and returned with something in his hand. It was the javelin\nwith the iron point—or, rather, the two pieces of it. He had said\nnothing of what he had seen to the girl.\n\nEmmeline was seated on the grass; she had a long strip of the striped\nflannel stuff about her, worn like a scarf, and she had another piece\nin her hand which she was hemming. The bird was hopping about, pecking\nat a banana which they had thrown to him; a light breeze made the\nshadow of the artu leaves dance upon the grass, and the serrated leaves\nof the breadfruit to patter one on the other with the sound of\nrain-drops falling upon glass.\n\n“Where did you get it?” asked Emmeline, staring at the piece of the\njavelin which Dick had flung down almost beside her whilst he went into\nthe house to fetch the knife.\n\n“It was on the beach over there,” he replied, taking his seat and\nexamining the two fragments to see how he could splice them together.\n\nEmmeline looked at the pieces, putting them together in her mind. She\ndid not like the look of the thing: so keen and savage, and stained\ndark a foot and more from the point.\n\n“People had been there,” said Dick, putting the two pieces together and\nexamining the fracture critically.\n\n“Where?”\n\n“Over there. This was lying on the sand, and the sand was all trod up.”\n\n“Dick,” said Emmeline, “who were the people?”\n\n“I don’t know; I went up the hill and saw their boats going away—far\naway out. This was lying on the sand.”\n\n“Dick,” said Emmeline, “do you remember the noise yesterday?”\n\n“Yes,” said Dick.\n\n“I heard it in the night.”\n\n“When?”\n\n“In the night before the moon went away.”\n\n“That was them,” said Dick.\n\n“Dick!”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“Who were they?”\n\n“I don’t know,” replied Dick.\n\n“It was in the night, before the moon went away, and it went on and on\nbeating in the trees. I thought I was asleep, and then I knew I was\nawake; you were asleep, and I pushed you to listen, but you couldn’t\nwake, you were so asleep; then the moon went away, and the noise went\non. How did they make the noise?”\n\n“I don’t know,” replied Dick, “but it was them; and they left this on\nthe sand, and the sand was all trod up, and I saw their boats from the\nhill, away out far.”\n\n“I thought I heard voices,” said Emmeline, “but I was not sure.”\n\nShe fell into meditation, watching her companion at work on the savage\nand sinister-looking thing in his hands. He was splicing the two pieces\ntogether with a strip of the brown cloth-like stuff which is wrapped\nround the stalks of the cocoa-palm fronds. The thing seemed to have\nbeen hurled here out of the blue by some unseen hand.\n\nWhen he had spliced the pieces, doing so with marvellous dexterity, he\ntook the thing short down near the point, and began thrusting it into\nthe soft earth to clean it; then, with a bit of flannel, he polished it\ntill it shone. He felt a keen delight in it. It was useless as a\nfish-spear, because it had no barb, but it was a weapon. It was useless\nas a weapon, because there was no foe on the island to use it against;\nstill, it was a weapon.\n\nWhen he had finished scrubbing at it, he rose, hitched his old trousers\nup, tightened the belt of cocoa-cloth which Emmeline had made for him,\nwent into the house and got his fish-spear, and stalked off to the\nboat, calling out to Emmeline to follow him. They crossed over to the\nreef, where, as usual, he divested himself of clothing.\n\nIt was strange that out here he would go about stark naked, yet on the\nisland he always wore some covering. But not so strange, perhaps, after\nall.\n\nThe sea is a great purifier, both of the mind and the body; before that\ngreat sweet spirit people do not think in the same way as they think\nfar inland. What woman would appear in a town or on a country road, or\neven bathing in a river, as she appears bathing in the sea?\n\nSome instinct made Dick cover himself up on shore, and strip naked on\nthe reef. In a minute he was down by the edge of the surf, javelin in\none hand, fish-spear in the other.\n\nEmmeline, by a little pool the bottom of which was covered with\nbranching coral, sat gazing down into its depths, lost in a reverie\nlike that into which we fall when gazing at shapes in the fire. She had\nsat some time like this when a shout from Dick aroused her. She\nstarted to her feet and gazed to where he was pointing. An amazing\nthing was there.\n\nTo the east, just rounding the curve of the reef, and scarcely a\nquarter of a mile from it, was coming a big topsail schooner; a\nbeautiful sight she was, heeling to the breeze with every sail drawing,\nand the white foam like a feather at her fore-foot.\n\nDick, with the javelin in his hand, was standing gazing at her; he had\ndropped his fish-spear, and he stood as motionless as though he were\ncarved out of stone. Emmeline ran to him and stood beside him; neither\nof them spoke a word as the vessel drew closer.\n\nEverything was visible, so close was she now, from the reef points on\nthe great mainsail, luminous with the sunlight, and white as the wing\nof a gull, to the rail of the bulwarks. A crowd of men were hanging\nover the port bulwarks gazing at the island and the figures on the\nreef. Browned by the sun and sea-breeze, Emmeline’s hair blowing on the\nwind, and the point of Dick’s javelin flashing in the sun, they looked\nan ideal pair of savages, seen from the schooner’s deck.\n\n“They are going away,” said Emmeline, with a long-drawn breath of\nrelief.\n\nDick made no reply; he stared at the schooner a moment longer in\nsilence, then, having made sure that she was standing away from the\nland, he began to run up and down, calling out wildly, and beckoning to\nthe vessel as if to call her back.\n\nA moment later a sound came on the breeze, a faint hail; a flag was run\nup to the peak and dipped as in derision, and the vessel continued on\nher course.\n\nAs a matter of fact, she had been on the point of putting about. Her\ncaptain had for a moment been undecided as to whether the forms on the\nreef were those of castaways or savages. But the javelin in Dick’s hand\nhad turned the scale of his opinion in favour of the theory of savages.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nLOVE STEPS IN\n\nTwo birds were sitting in the branches of the artu tree: Koko had taken\na mate. They had built a nest out of fibres pulled from the wrappings\nof the cocoa-nut fronds, bits of stick and wire grass—anything, in\nfact; even fibres from the palmetto thatch of the house below. The\npilferings of birds, the building of nests, what charming incidents\nthey are in the great episode of spring!\n\nThe hawthorn tree never bloomed here, the climate was that of eternal\nsummer, yet the spirit of May came just as she comes to the English\ncountryside or the German forest. The doings in the artu branches\ngreatly interested Emmeline.\n\nThe love-making and the nest-building were conducted quite in the usual\nmanner, according to rules laid down by Nature and carried out by men\nand birds. All sorts of quaint sounds came filtering down through the\nleaves from the branch where the sapphire-coloured lovers sat side by\nside, or the fork where the nest was beginning to form: croonings and\ncluckings, sounds like the flirting of a fan, the sounds of a squabble,\nfollowed by the sounds that told of the squabble made up. Sometimes\nafter one of these squabbles a pale blue downy feather or two would\ncome floating earthwards, touch the palmetto leaves of the house-roof\nand cling there, or be blown on to the grass.\n\nIt was some days after the appearance of the schooner, and Dick was\nmaking ready to go into the woods and pick guavas. He had all the\nmorning been engaged in making a basket to carry them in. In\ncivilisation he would, judging from his mechanical talent, perhaps have\nbeen an engineer, building bridges and ships, instead of palmetto-leaf\nbaskets and cane houses—who knows if he would have been happier?\n\nThe heat of midday had passed, when, with the basket hanging over his\nshoulder on a piece of cane, he started for the woods, Emmeline\nfollowing. The place they were going to always filled her with a vague\ndread; not for a great deal would she have gone there alone. Dick had\ndiscovered it in one of his rambles.\n\nThey entered the wood and passed a little well, a well without apparent\nsource or outlet and a bottom of fine white sand. How the sand had\nformed there, it would be impossible to say; but there it was, and\naround the margin grew ferns redoubling themselves on the surface of\nthe crystal-clear water. They left this to the right and struck into\nthe heart of the wood. The heat of midday still lurked here; the way\nwas clear, for there was a sort of path between the trees, as if, in\nvery ancient days, there had been a road.\n\nRight across this path, half lost in shadow, half sunlit, the lianas\nhung their ropes. The hotoo tree, with its powdering of delicate\nblossoms, here stood, showing its lost loveliness to the sun; in the\nshade the scarlet hibiscus burned like a flame. Artu and breadfruit\ntrees and cocoa-nut bordered the way.\n\nAs they proceeded the trees grew denser and the path more obscure. All\nat once, rounding a sharp turn, the path ended in a valley carpeted\nwith fern. This was the place that always filled Emmeline with an\nundefined dread. One side of it was all built up in terraces with huge\nblocks of stone. Blocks of stone so enormous, that the wonder was how\nthe ancient builders had put them in their places.\n\nTrees grew along the terraces, thrusting their roots between the\ninterstices of the blocks. At their base, slightly tilted forward as if\nwith the sinkage of years, stood a great stone figure roughly carved,\nthirty feet high at least—mysterious-looking, the very spirit of the\nplace. This figure and the terraces, the valley itself, and the very\ntrees that grew there, inspired Emmeline with deep curiosity and vague\nfear.\n\nPeople had been here once; sometimes she could fancy she saw dark\nshadows moving amidst the trees, and the whisper of the foliage seemed\nto her to hide voices at times, even as its shadow concealed forms. It\nwas indeed an uncanny place to be alone in even under the broad light\nof day. All across the Pacific for thousands of miles you find relics\nof the past, like these scattered through the islands.\n\nThese temple places are nearly all the same: great terraces of stone,\nmassive idols, desolation overgrown with foliage. They hint at one\nreligion, and a time when the sea space of the Pacific was a continent,\nwhich, sinking slowly through the ages, has left only its higher lands\nand hill-tops visible in the form of islands. Round these places the\nwoods are thicker than elsewhere, hinting at the presence there, once,\nof sacred groves. The idols are immense, their faces are vague; the\nstorms and the suns and the rains of the ages have cast over them a\nveil. The sphinx is understandable and a toy compared to these things,\nsome of which have a stature of fifty feet, whose creation is veiled in\nabsolute mystery—the gods of a people for ever and for ever lost.\n\nThe “stone man” was the name Emmeline had given the idol of the valley;\nand sometimes at nights, when her thoughts would stray that way, she\nwould picture him standing all alone in the moonlight or starlight\nstaring straight before him.\n\nHe seemed for ever listening; unconsciously one fell to listening too,\nand then the valley seemed steeped in a supernatural silence. He was\nnot good to be alone with.\n\nEmmeline sat down amidst the fears just at his base. When one was close\nup to him he lost the suggestion of life, and was simply a great stone\nwhich cast a shadow in the sun.\n\nDick threw himself down also to rest. Then he rose up and went off\namidst the guava bushes, plucking the fruit and filling his basket.\nSince he had seen the schooner, the white men on her decks, her great\nmasts and sails, and general appearance of freedom and speed and\nunknown adventure, he had been more than ordinarily glum and restless.\nPerhaps he connected her in his mind with the far-away vision of the\n_Northumberland_, and the idea of other places and lands, and the\nyearning for change the idea of them inspired.\n\nHe came back with his basket full of the ripe fruit, gave some to the\ngirl and sat down beside her. When she had finished eating them she\ntook the cane that he used for carrying the basket and held it in her\nhands. She was bending it in the form of a bow when it slipped, flew\nout and struck her companion a sharp blow on the side of his face.\n\nAlmost on the instant he turned and slapped her on the shoulder. She\nstared at him for a moment in troubled amazement, a sob came in her\nthroat. Then some veil seemed lifted, some wizard’s wand stretched out,\nsome mysterious vial broken. As she looked at him like that, he\nsuddenly and fiercely clasped her in his arms. He held her like this\nfor a moment, dazed, stupefied, not knowing what to do with her. Then\nher lips told him, for they met his in an endless kiss.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE SLEEP OF PARADISE\n\nThe moon rose up that evening and shot her silver arrows at the house\nunder the artu tree. The house was empty. Then the moon came across the\nsea and across the reef.\n\nShe lit the lagoon to its dark, dim heart. She lit the coral brains and\nsand spaces, and the fish, casting their shadows on the sand and the\ncoral. The keeper of the lagoon rose to greet her, and the fin of him\nbroke her reflection on the mirror-like surface into a thousand\nglittering ripples. She saw the white staring ribs of the form on the\nreef. Then, peeping over the trees, she looked down into the valley,\nwhere the great idol of stone had kept its solitary vigil for five\nthousand years, perhaps, or more.\n\nAt his base, in his shadow, looking as if under his protection, lay two\nhuman beings, naked, clasped in each other’s arms, and fast asleep. One\ncould scarcely pity his vigil, had it been marked sometimes through the\nyears by such an incident as this. The thing had been conducted just as\nthe birds conduct their love affairs. An affair absolutely natural,\nabsolutely blameless, and without sin.\n\nIt was a marriage according to Nature, without feast or guests,\nconsummated with accidental cynicism under the shadow of a religion a\nthousand years dead.\n\nSo happy in their ignorance were they, that they only knew that\nsuddenly life had changed, that the skies and the sea were bluer, and\nthat they had become in some magical way one a part of the other. The\nbirds on the tree above were equally as happy in their ignorance, and\nin their love.\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nAN ISLAND HONEYMOON\n\nOne day Dick climbed on to the tree above the house, and, driving\nMadame Koko off the nest upon which she was sitting, peeped in. There\nwere several pale green eggs in it. He did not disturb them, but\nclimbed down again, and the bird resumed her seat as if nothing had\nhappened. Such an occurrence would have terrified a bird used to the\nways of men, but here the birds were so fearless and so full of\nconfidence that often they would follow Emmeline in the wood, flying\nfrom branch to branch, peering at her through the leaves, lighting\nquite close to her—once, even, on her shoulder.\n\nThe days passed. Dick had lost his restlessness: his wish to wander had\nvanished. He had no reason to wander; perhaps that was the reason why.\nIn all the broad earth he could not have found anything more desirable\nthan what he had.\n\nInstead now of finding a half-naked savage followed dog-like by his\nmate, you would have found of an evening a pair of lovers wandering on\nthe reef. They had in a pathetic sort of way attempted to adorn the\nhouse with a blue flowering creeper taken from the wood and trained\nover the entrance.\n\nEmmeline, up to this, had mostly done the cooking, such as it was; Dick\nhelped her now, always. He talked to her no longer in short sentences\nflung out as if to a dog; and she, almost losing the strange reserve\nthat had clung to her from childhood, half showed him her mind. It was\na curious mind: the mind of a dreamer, almost the mind of a poet. The\nCluricaunes dwelt there, and vague shapes born of things she had heard\nabout or dreamt of: she had thoughts about the sea and stars, the\nflowers and birds.\n\nDick would listen to her as she talked, as a man might listen to the\nsound of a rivulet. His practical mind could take no share in the\ndreams of his other half, but her conversation pleased him.\n\nHe would look at her for a long time together, absorbed in thought. He\nwas admiring her.\n\nHer hair, blue-black and glossy, tangled him in its meshes; he would\nstroke it, so to speak, with his eyes, and then pull her close to him\nand bury his face in it; the smell of it was intoxicating. He breathed\nher as one does the perfume of a rose.\n\nHer ears were small, and like little white shells. He would take one\nbetween finger and thumb and play with it as if it were a toy, pulling\nat the lobe of it, or trying to flatten out the curved part. Her\nbreasts, her shoulders, her knees, her little feet, every bit of her,\nhe would examine and play with and kiss. She would lie and let him,\nseeming absorbed in some far-away thought, of which he was the object,\nthen all at once her arms would go round him. All this used to go on in\nthe broad light of day, under the shadow of the artu leaves, with no\none to watch except the bright-eyed birds in the leaves above.\n\nNot all their time would be spent in this fashion. Dick was just as\nkeen after the fish. He dug up with a spade—improvised from one of the\nboards of the dinghy—a space of soft earth near the taro patch and\nplanted the seeds of melons he found in the wood; he rethatched the\nhouse. They were, in short, as busy as they could be in such a climate,\nbut love-making would come on them in fits, and then everything would\nbe forgotten. Just as one revisits some spot to renew the memory of a\npainful or pleasant experience received there, they would return to the\nvalley of the idol and spend a whole afternoon in its shade. The\nabsolute happiness of wandering through the woods together, discovering\nnew flowers, getting lost, and finding their way again, was a thing\nbeyond expression.\n\nDick had suddenly stumbled upon Love. His courtship had lasted only\nsome twenty minutes; it was being gone over again now, and extended.\n\nOne day, hearing a curious noise from the tree above the house, he\nclimbed it. The noise came from the nest, which had been temporarily\nleft by the mother bird. It was a gasping, wheezing sound, and it came\nfrom four wide-open beaks, so anxious to be fed that one could almost\nsee into the very crops of the owners. They were Koko’s children. In\nanother year each of those ugly downy things would, if permitted to\nlive, be a beautiful sapphire-coloured bird with a few dove-coloured\ntail feathers, coral beak, and bright, intelligent eyes. A few days ago\neach of these things was imprisoned in a pale green egg. A month ago\nthey were nowhere.\n\nSomething hit Dick on the cheek. It was the mother bird returned with\nfood for the young ones. Dick drew his head aside, and she proceeded\nwithout more ado to fill their crops.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE VANISHING OF EMMELINE\n\nMonths passed away. Only one bird remained in the branches of the artu:\nKoko’s children and mate had vanished, but he remained. The breadfruit\nleaves had turned from green to pale gold and darkest amber, and now\nthe new green leaves were being presented to the spring.\n\nDick, who had a complete chart of the lagoon in his head, and knew all\nthe soundings and best fishing places, the locality of the stinging\ncoral, and the places where you could wade right across at low\ntide—Dick, one morning, was gathering his things together for a\nfishing expedition. The place he was going to lay some two and a half\nmiles away across the island, and as the road was bad he was going\nalone.\n\nEmmeline had been passing a new thread through the beads of the\nnecklace she sometimes wore. This necklace had a history. In the\nshallows not far away, Dick had found a bed of shell-fish; wading out\nat low tide, he had taken some of them out to examine. They were\noysters. The first one he opened, so disgusting did its appearance seem\nto him, might have been the last, only that under the beard of the\nthing lay a pearl. It was about twice the size of a large pea, and so\nlustrous that even he could not but admire its beauty, though quite\nunconscious of its value.\n\nHe flung the unopened oysters down, and took the thing to Emmeline.\nNext day, returning by chance to the same spot, he found the oysters he\nhad cast down all dead and open in the sun. He examined them, and\nfound another pearl embedded in one of them. Then he collected nearly a\nbushel of the oysters, and left them to die and open. The idea had\noccurred to him of making a necklace for his companion. She had one\nmade of shells, he intended to make her one of pearls.\n\nIt took a long time, but it was something to do. He pierced them with a\nbig needle, and at the end of four months or so the thing was complete.\nGreat pearls most of them were—pure white, black, pink, some perfectly\nround, some tear shaped, some irregular. The thing was worth fifteen,\nor perhaps twenty thousand pounds, for he only used the biggest he\ncould find, casting away the small ones as useless.\n\nEmmeline this morning had just finished restringing them on a double\nthread. She looked pale and not at all well and had been restless all\nnight.\n\nAs he went off, armed with his spear and fishing tackle, she waved her\nhand to him without getting up. Usually she followed him a bit into the\nwood when he was going away like this, but this morning she just sat at\nthe doorway of the little house, the necklace in her lap, following him\nwith her eyes until he was lost amidst the trees.\n\nHe had no compass to guide him, and he needed none. He knew the woods\nby heart. The mysterious line beyond which scarcely an artu tree was to\nbe found. The long strip of mammee apple—a regular sheet of it a\nhundred yards broad, and reaching from the middle of the island right\ndown to the lagoon. The clearings, some almost circular where the ferns\ngrew knee-deep. Then he came to the bad part.\n\nThe vegetation here had burst into a riot. All sorts of great sappy\nstalks of unknown plants barred the way and tangled the foot; and there\nwere boggy places into which one sank horribly. Pausing to wipe one’s\nbrow, the stalks and tendrils one had beaten down, or beaten aside,\nrose up and closed together, making one a prisoner almost as closely\nsurrounded as a fly in amber.\n\nAll the noontides that had ever fallen upon the island seemed to have\nleft some of their heat behind them here. The air was damp and close\nlike the air of a laundry; and the mournful and perpetual buzz of\ninsects filled the silence without destroying it.\n\nA hundred men with scythes might make a road through the place to-day;\na month or two later, searching for the road, you would find none—the\nvegetation would have closed in as water closes when divided.\n\nThis was the haunt of the jug orchid—a veritable jug, lid and all.\nRaising the lid you would find the jug half filled with water.\nSometimes in the tangle up above, between two trees, you would see a\nthing like a bird come to ruin. Orchids grew here as in a hothouse. All\nthe trees—the few there were—had a spectral and miserable appearance.\nThey were half starved by the voluptuous growth of the gigantic weeds.\n\nIf one had much imagination one felt afraid in this place, for one felt\nnot alone. At any moment it seemed that one might be touched on the\nelbow by a hand reaching out from the surrounding tangle. Even Dick\nfelt this, unimaginative and fearless as he was. It took him nearly\nthree-quarters of an hour to get through, and then, at last, came the\nblessed air of real day, and a glimpse of the lagoon between the\ntree-boles.\n\nHe would have rowed round in the dinghy, only that at low tide the\nshallows of the north of the island were a bar to the boat’s passage.\nOf course he might have rowed all the way round by way of the strand\nand reef entrance, but that would have meant a circuit of six miles or\nmore. When he came between the trees down to the lagoon edge it was\nabout eleven o’clock in the morning, and the tide was nearly at the\nfull.\n\nThe lagoon just here was like a trough, and the reef was very near,\nscarcely a quarter of a mile from the shore. The water did not shelve,\nit went down sheer fifty fathoms or more, and one could fish from the\nbank just as from a pier head. He had brought some food with him, and\nhe placed it under a tree whilst he prepared his line, which had a lump\nof coral for a sinker. He baited the hook, and whirling the sinker\nround in the air sent it flying out a hundred feet from shore. There\nwas a baby cocoa-nut tree growing just at the edge of the water. He\nfastened the end of his line round the narrow stem, in case of\neventualities, and then, holding the line itself, he fished.\n\nHe had promised Emmeline to return before sundown.\n\nHe was a fisherman. That is to say, a creature with the enduring\npatience of a cat, tireless and heedless of time as an oyster. He came\nhere for sport more than for fish. Large things were to be found in\nthis part of the lagoon. The last time he had hooked a horror in the\nform of a cat-fish; at least in outward appearance it was likest to a\nMississippi cat-fish. Unlike the cat-fish, it was coarse and useless as\nfood, but it gave good sport.\n\nThe tide was now going out, and it was at the going-out of the tide\nthat the best fishing was to be had. There was no wind, and the lagoon\nlay like a sheet of glass, with just a dimple here and there where the\noutgoing tide made a swirl in the water.\n\nAs he fished he thought of Emmeline and the little house under the\ntrees. Scarcely one could call it thinking. Pictures passed before his\nmind’s eye—pleasant and happy pictures, sunlit, moonlit, starlit.\n\nThree hours passed thus without a bite or symptom that the lagoon\ncontained anything else but sea water, and disappointment; but he did\nnot grumble. He was a fisherman. Then he left the line tied to the tree\nand sat down to eat the food he had brought with him. He had scarcely\nfinished his meal when the baby cocoa-nut tree shivered and became\nconvulsed, and he did not require to touch the taut line to know that\nit was useless to attempt to cope with the thing at the end of it. The\nonly course was to let it tug and drown itself. So he sat down and\nwatched.\n\nAfter a few minutes the line slackened, and the little cocoa-nut tree\nresumed its attitude of pensive meditation and repose. He pulled the\nline up: there was nothing at the end of it but a hook. He did not\ngrumble; he baited the hook again, and flung it in, for it was quite\nlikely that the ferocious thing in the water would bite again.\n\nFull of this idea and heedless of time he fished and waited. The sun\nwas sinking into the west—he did not heed it. He had quite forgotten\nthat he had promised Emmeline to return before sunset; it was nearly\nsunset now. Suddenly, just behind him, from among the trees, he heard\nher voice, crying:\n\n“Dick!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE VANISHING OF EMMELINE (continued)\n\nHe dropped the line, and turned with a start. There was no one visible.\nHe ran amongst the trees calling out her name, but only echoes\nanswered. Then he came back to the lagoon edge.\n\nHe felt sure that what he had heard was only fancy, but it was nearly\nsunset, and more than time to be off. He pulled in his line, wrapped it\nup, took his fish-spear and started.\n\nIt was just in the middle of the bad place that dread came to him.\nWhat if anything had happened to her? It was dusk here, and never had\nthe weeds seemed so thick, dimness so dismal, the tendrils of the vines\nso gin-like. Then he lost his way—he who was so sure of his way\nalways! The hunter’s instinct had been crossed, and for a time he went\nhither and thither helpless as a ship without a compass. At last he\nbroke into the real wood, but far to the right of where he ought to\nhave been. He felt like a beast escaped from a trap, and hurried along,\nled by the sound of the surf.\n\nWhen he reached the clear sward that led down to the lagoon the sun had\njust vanished beyond the sea-line. A streak of red cloud floated like\nthe feather of a flamingo in the western sky close to the sea, and\ntwilight had already filled the world. He could see the house dimly,\nunder the shadow of the trees, and he ran towards it, crossing the\nsward diagonally.\n\nAlways before, when he had been away, the first thing to greet his eyes\non his return had been the figure of Emmeline. Either at the lagoon\nedge or the house door he would find her waiting for him.\n\nShe was not waiting for him to-night. When he reached the house she was\nnot there, and he paused, after searching the place, a prey to the most\nhorrible perplexity, and unable for the moment to think or act.\n\nSince the shock of the occurrence on the reef she had been subject at\ntimes to occasional attacks of headache; and when the pain was more\nthan she could bear, she would go off and hide. Dick would hunt for her\namidst the trees, calling out her name and hallooing. A faint “halloo”\nwould answer when she heard him, and then he would find her under a\ntree or bush, with her unfortunate head between her hands, a picture of\nmisery.\n\nHe remembered this now, and started off along the borders of the wood,\ncalling to her, and pausing to listen. No answer came.\n\nHe searched amidst the trees as far as the little well, waking the\nechoes with his voice; then he came back slowly, peering about him in\nthe deep dusk that now was yielding to the starlight. He sat down\nbefore the door of the house, and, looking at him, you might have\nfancied him in the last stages of exhaustion. Profound grief and\nprofound exhaustion act on the frame very much in the same way. He sat\nwith his chin resting on his chest, his hands helpless. He could hear\nher voice, still as he heard it over at the other side of the island.\nShe had been in danger and called to him, and he had been calmly\nfishing, unconscious of it all.\n\nThis thought maddened him. He sat up, stared around him and beat the\nground with the palms of his hands; then he sprang to his feet and made\nfor the dinghy. He rowed to the reef: the action of a madman, for she\ncould not possibly be there.\n\nThere was no moon, the starlight both lit and veiled the world, and no\nsound but the majestic thunder of the waves. As he stood, the night\nwind blowing on his face, the white foam seething before him, and\nCanopus burning in the great silence overhead, the fact that he stood\nin the centre of an awful and profound indifference came to his\nuntutored mind with a pang.\n\nHe returned to the shore: the house was still deserted. A little bowl\nmade from the shell of a cocoa-nut stood on the grass near the doorway.\nHe had last seen it in her hands, and he took it up and held it for a\nmoment, pressing it tightly to his breast. Then he threw himself down\nbefore the doorway, and lay upon his face, with head resting upon his\narms in the attitude of a person who is profoundly asleep.\n\nHe must have searched through the woods again that night just as a\nsomnambulist searches, for he found himself towards dawn in the valley\nbefore the idol. Then it was daybreak—the world was full of light and\ncolour. He was seated before the house door, worn out and exhausted,\nwhen, raising his head, he saw Emmeline’s figure coming out from amidst\nthe distant trees on the other side of the sward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE NEWCOMER\n\nHe could not move for a moment, then he sprang to his feet and ran\ntowards her. She looked pale and dazed, and she held something in her\narms; something wrapped up in her scarf. As he pressed her to him, the\nsomething in the bundle struggled against his breast and emitted a\nsquall—just like the squall of a cat. He drew back, and Emmeline,\ntenderly moving her scarf a bit aside, exposed a wee face. It was\nbrick-red and wrinkled; there were two bright eyes, and a tuft of dark\nhair over the forehead. Then the eyes closed, the face screwed itself\nup, and the thing sneezed twice.\n\n“Where did you _get_ it?” he asked, absolutely lost in astonishment as\nshe covered the face again gently with the scarf.\n\n“I found it in the woods,” replied Emmeline.\n\nDumb with amazement, he helped her along to the house, and she sat\ndown, resting her head against the bamboos of the wall.\n\n“I felt so bad,” she explained; “and then I went off to sit in the\nwoods, and then I remembered nothing more, and when I woke up it was\nthere.”\n\n“It’s a baby!” said Dick.\n\n“I know,” replied Emmeline.\n\nMrs James’s baby, seen in the long ago, had risen up before their\nmind’s eyes, a messenger from the past to explain what the new thing\nwas. Then she told him things—things that completely shattered the old\n“cabbage bed” theory, supplanting it with a truth far more wonderful,\nfar more poetical, too, to he who can appreciate the marvel and the\nmystery of life.\n\n“It has something funny tied on to it,” she went on, as if she were\nreferring to a parcel she had just received.\n\n“Let’s look,” said Dick.\n\n“No,” she replied; “leave it alone.”\n\nShe sat rocking the thing gently, seeming oblivious to the whole world,\nand quite absorbed in it, as, indeed, was Dick. A physician would have\nshuddered, but, perhaps fortunately enough, there was no physician on\nthe island. Only Nature, and she put everything to rights in her own\ntime and way.\n\nWhen Dick had sat marvelling long enough, he set to and lit the fire.\nHe had eaten nothing since the day before, and he was nearly as\nexhausted as the girl. He cooked some breadfruit, there was some cold\nfish left over from the day before; this, with some bananas, he served\nup on two broad leaves, making Emmeline eat first.\n\nBefore they had finished, the creature in the bundle, as though it had\nsmelt the food, began to scream. Emmeline drew the scarf aside. It\nlooked hungry; its mouth would now be pinched up and now wide open, its\neyes opened and closed. The girl touched it on the lips with her\nfinger, and it seized upon her fingertip and sucked it. Her eyes filled\nwith tears, she looked appealingly at Dick, who was on his knees; he\ntook a banana, peeled it, broke off a bit and handed it to her. She\napproached it to the baby’s mouth. It tried to suck it, failed, blew\nbubbles at the sun and squalled.\n\n“Wait a minute,” said Dick.\n\nThere were some green cocoa-nuts he had gathered the day before close\nby. He took one, removed the green husk, and opened one of the eyes,\nmaking an opening also in the opposite side of the shell. The\nunfortunate infant sucked ravenously at the nut, filled its stomach\nwith the young cocoa-nut juice, vomited violently, and wailed. Emmeline\nin despair clasped it to her naked breast, wherefrom, in a moment, it\nwas hanging like a leech. It knew more about babies than they did.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nHANNAH\n\nAt noon, in the shallows of the reef, under the burning sun, the water\nwould be quite warm. They would carry the baby down here, and Emmeline\nwould wash it with a bit of flannel. After a few days it scarcely ever\nscreamed, even when she washed it. It would lie on her knees during the\nprocess, striking valiantly out with its arms and legs, staring\nstraight up at the sky. Then, when she turned it on its face, it would\nlay its head down and chuckle and blow bubbles at the coral of the\nreef, examining, apparently, the pattern of the coral with deep and\nphilosophic attention.\n\nDick would sit by with his knees up to his chin, watching it all. He\nfelt himself to be part proprietor in the thing—as indeed he was.\nThe mystery of the affair still hung over them both. A week ago they\ntwo had been alone, and suddenly from nowhere this new individual had\nappeared.\n\nIt was so complete. It had hair on its head, tiny finger-nails, and\nhands that would grasp you. It had a whole host of little ways of its\nown, and every day added to them.\n\nIn a week the extreme ugliness of the newborn child had vanished. Its\nface, which had seemed carved in the imitation of a monkey’s face from\nhalf a brick, became the face of a happy and healthy baby. It seemed to\nsee things, and sometimes it would laugh and chuckle as though it had\nbeen told a good joke. Its black hair all came off and was supplanted\nby a sort of down. It had no teeth. It would lie on its back and kick\nand crow, and double its fists up and try to swallow them alternately,\nand cross its feet and play with its toes. In fact, it was exactly like\nany of the thousand-and-one babies that are born into the world at\nevery tick of the clock.\n\n“What will we call it?” said Dick one day, as he sat watching his son\nand heir crawling about on the grass under the shade of the breadfruit\nleaves.\n\n“Hannah,” said Emmeline promptly.\n\nThe recollection of another baby once heard about was in her mind; and\nit was as good a name as any other, perhaps, in that lonely place,\nnotwithstanding the fact that Hannah was a boy.\n\nKoko took a vast interest in the new arrival. He would hop round it and\npeer at it with his head on one side; and Hannah would crawl after the\nbird and try to grab it by the tail. In a few months so valiant and\nstrong did he become that he would pursue his own father, crawling\nbefore him on the grass, and you might have seen the mother and father\nand child playing all together like three children, the bird sometimes\nhovering overhead like a good spirit, sometimes joining in the fun.\n\nSometimes Emmeline would sit and brood over the child, a troubled\nexpression on her face and a far-away look in her eyes. The old vague\nfear of mischance had returned—the dread of that viewless form her\nimagination half pictured behind the smile on the face of Nature. Her\nhappiness was so great that she dreaded to lose it.\n\nThere is nothing more wonderful than the birth of a man, and all that\ngoes to bring it about. Here, on this island, in the very heart of the\nsea, amidst the sunshine and the wind-blown trees, under the great blue\narch of the sky, in perfect purity of thought, they would discuss the\nquestion from beginning to end without a blush, the object of their\ndiscussion crawling before them on the grass, and attempting to grab\nfeathers from Koko’s tail.\n\nIt was the loneliness of the place as well as their ignorance of life\nthat made the old, old miracle appear so strange and fresh—as\nbeautiful as the miracle of death had appeared awful. In thoughts vague\nand beyond expression in words, they linked this new occurrence with\nthat old occurrence on the reef six years before. The vanishing and the\ncoming of a man.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\nHannah, despite his unfortunate name, was certainly a most virile and\nengaging baby. The black hair which had appeared and vanished like some\npractical joke played by Nature, gave place to a down at first as\nyellow as sun-bleached wheat, but in a few months’ time tinged with\nauburn.\n\nOne day—he had been uneasy and biting at his thumbs for some time\npast—Emmeline, looking into his mouth, saw something white and like a\ngrain of rice protruding from his gum. It was a tooth just born. He\ncould eat bananas now, and breadfruit, and they often fed him on\nfish—a fact which again might have caused a medical man to shudder;\nyet he throve on it all, and waxed stouter every day.\n\nEmmeline, with a profound and natural wisdom, let him crawl about stark\nnaked, dressed in ozone and sunlight. Taking him out on the reef, she\nwould let him paddle in the shallow pools, holding him under the\narmpits whilst he splashed the diamond-bright water into spray with his\nfeet, and laughed and shouted.\n\nThey were beginning now to experience a phenomenon, as wonderful as the\nbirth of the child’s body—the birth of his intelligence: the peeping\nout of a little personality with predilections of its own, likes and\ndislikes.\n\nHe knew Dick from Emmeline; and when Emmeline had satisfied his\nmaterial wants, he would hold out his arms to go to Dick if he were by.\nHe looked upon Koko as a friend, but when a friend of Koko’s—a bird\nwith an inquisitive mind and three red feathers in his tail—dropped in\none day to inspect the newcomer, he resented the intrusion, and\nscreamed.\n\nHe had a passion for flowers, or anything bright. He would laugh and\nshout when taken on the lagoon in the dinghy, and make as if to jump\ninto the water to get at the bright-coloured corals below.\n\nAh me! we laugh at young mothers, and all the miraculous things they\ntell us about their babies. They see what we cannot see: the first\nunfolding of that mysterious flower, the mind.\n\nOne day they were out on the lagoon. Dick had been rowing; he had\nceased, and was letting the boat drift for a bit. Emmeline was dancing\nthe child on her knee, when it suddenly held out its arms to the\noarsman and said:\n\n“Dick!”\n\nThe little word, so often heard and easily repeated, was its first word\non earth.\n\nA voice that had never spoken in the world before, had spoken; and to\nhear his name thus mysteriously uttered by a being he has created, is\nthe sweetest and perhaps the saddest thing a man can ever know.\n\nDick took the child on his knee, and from that moment his love for it\nwas more than his love for Emmeline or anything else on earth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE LAGOON OF FIRE\n\nEver since the tragedy of six years ago there had been forming in the\nmind of Emmeline Lestrange a something—shall I call it a deep\nmistrust. She had never been clever; lessons had saddened and wearied\nher, without making her much the wiser. Yet her mind was of that order\ninto which profound truths come by short cuts. She was intuitive.\n\nGreat knowledge may lurk in the human mind without the owner of the\nmind being aware. He or she acts in such or such a way, or thinks in\nsuch and such a manner from intuition; in other words, as the outcome\nof the profoundest reasoning.\n\nWhen we have learned to call storms, storms, and death, death, and\nbirth, birth; when we have mastered the sailor’s horn book, and Mr\nPiddington’s law of cyclones, Ellis’s anatomy, and Lewer’s midwifery,\nwe have already made ourselves half blind. We have become hypnotised by\nwords and names. We think in words and names, not in ideas; the\ncommonplace has triumphed, the true intellect is half crushed.\n\nStorms had burst over the island before this. And what Emmeline\nremembered of them might be expressed by an instance.\n\nThe morning would be bright and happy, never so bright the sun, or so\nbalmy the breeze, or so peaceful the blue lagoon; then, with a horrid\nsuddenness, as if sick with dissimulation and mad to show itself,\nsomething would blacken the sun, and with a yell stretch out a hand and\nravage the island, churn the lagoon into foam, beat down the cocoa-nut\ntrees, and slay the birds. And one bird would be left and another\ntaken, one tree destroyed, and another left standing. The fury of the\nthing was less fearful than the blindness of it, and the indifference\nof it.\n\nOne night, when the child was asleep, just after the last star was lit,\nDick appeared at the doorway of the house. He had been down to the\nwater’s edge and had now returned. He beckoned Emmeline to follow him,\nand, putting down the child, she did so.\n\n“Come here and look,” said he.\n\nHe led the way to the water; and as they approached it, Emmeline became\naware that there was something strange about the lagoon. From a\ndistance it looked pale and solid; it might have been a great stretch\nof grey marble veined with black. Then, as she drew nearer, she saw\nthat the dull grey appearance was a deception of the eye.\n\nThe lagoon was alight and burning.\n\nThe phosphoric fire was in its very heart and being; every coral branch\nwas a torch, every fish a passing lantern. The incoming tide moving the\nwaters made the whole glittering floor of the lagoon move and shiver,\nand the tiny waves to lap the bank, leaving behind them glow-worm\ntraces.\n\n“Look!” said Dick.\n\nHe knelt down and plunged his forearm into the water. The immersed part\nburned like a smouldering torch. Emmeline could see it as plainly as\nthough it were lit by sunlight. Then he drew his arm out, and as far as\nthe water had reached, it was covered by a glowing glove.\n\nThey had seen the phosphorescence of the lagoon before; indeed, any\nnight you might watch the passing fish like bars of silver, when the\nmoon was away; but this was something quite new, and it was entrancing.\n\nEmmeline knelt down and dabbled her hands, and made herself a pair of\nphosphoric gloves, and cried out with pleasure, and laughed. It was all\nthe pleasure of playing with fire without the danger of being burnt.\nThen Dick rubbed his face with the water till it glowed.\n\n“Wait!” he cried; and, running up to the house, he fetched out Hannah.\n\nHe came running down with him to the water’s edge, gave Emmeline the\nchild, unmoored the boat, and started out from shore.\n\nThe sculls, as far as they were immersed, were like bars of glistening\nsilver; under them passed the fish, leaving cometic tails; each coral\nclump was a lamp, lending its lustre till the great lagoon was luminous\nas a lit-up ballroom. Even the child on Emmeline’s lap crowed and cried\nout at the strangeness of the sight.\n\nThey landed on the reef and wandered over the flat. The sea was white\nand bright as snow, and the foam looked like a hedge of fire.\n\nAs they stood gazing on this extraordinary sight, suddenly, almost as\ninstantaneously as the switching off of an electric light, the\nphosphorescence of the sea flickered and vanished.\n\nThe moon was rising. Her crest was just breaking from the water, and as\nher face came slowly into view behind a belt of vapour that lay on the\nhorizon, it looked fierce and red, stained with smoke like the face of\nEblis.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE CYCLONE\n\nWhen they awoke next morning the day was dark. A solid roof of cloud,\nlead-coloured and without a ripple on it, lay over the sky, almost to\nthe horizon. There was not a breath of wind, and the birds flew wildly\nabout as if disturbed by some unseen enemy in the wood.\n\nAs Dick lit the fire to prepare the breakfast, Emmeline walked up and\ndown, holding her baby to her breast; she felt restless and uneasy.\n\nAs the morning wore on the darkness increased; a breeze rose up, and\nthe leaves of the breadfruit trees pattered together with the sound of\nrain falling upon glass. A storm was coming, but there was something\ndifferent in its approach to the approach of the storms they had\nalready known.\n\nAs the breeze increased a sound filled the air, coming from far away\nbeyond the horizon. It was like the sound of a great multitude of\npeople, and yet so faint and vague was it that sudden bursts of the\nbreeze through the leaves above would drown it utterly. Then it ceased,\nand nothing could be heard but the rocking of the branches and the\ntossing of the leaves under the increasing wind, which was now blowing\nsharply and fiercely and with a steady rush dead from the west,\nfretting the lagoon, and sending clouds and masses of foam right over\nthe reef. The sky that had been so leaden and peaceful and like a solid\nroof was now all in a hurry, flowing eastward like a great turbulent\nriver in spate.\n\nAnd now, again, one could hear the sound in the distance—the thunder\nof the captains of the storm and the shouting; but still so faint, so\nvague, so indeterminate and unearthly that it seemed like the sound in\na dream.\n\nEmmeline sat amidst the ferns on the floor cowed and dumb, holding the\nbaby to her breast. It was fast asleep. Dick stood at the doorway. He\nwas disturbed in mind, but he did not show it.\n\nThe whole beautiful island world had now taken on the colour of ashes\nand the colour of lead. Beauty had utterly vanished, all seemed sadness\nand distress.\n\nThe cocoa-palms, under the wind that had lost its steady rush and was\nnow blowing in hurricane blasts, flung themselves about in all the\nattitudes of distress; and whoever has seen a tropical storm will know\nwhat a cocoa-palm can express by its movements under the lash of the\nwind.\n\nFortunately the house was so placed that it was protected by the whole\ndepth of the grove between it and the lagoon; and fortunately, too, it\nwas sheltered by the dense foliage of the breadfruit, for suddenly,\nwith a crash of thunder as if the hammer of Thor had been flung from\nsky to earth, the clouds split and the rain came down in a great\nslanting wave. It roared on the foliage above, which, bending leaf on\nleaf, made a slanting roof from which it rushed in a steady sheet-like\ncascade.\n\nDick had darted into the house, and was now sitting beside Emmeline,\nwho was shivering and holding the child, which had awakened at the\nsound of the thunder.\n\nFor an hour they sat, the rain ceasing and coming again, the thunder\nshaking earth and sea, and the wind passing overhead with a piercing,\nmonotonous cry.\n\nThen all at once the wind dropped, the rain ceased, and a pale spectral\nlight, like the light of dawn, fell before the doorway.\n\n“It’s over!” cried Dick, making to get up.\n\n“Oh, listen!” said Emmeline, clinging to him, and holding the baby to\nhis breast as if the touch of him would give it protection. She had\ndivined that there was something approaching worse than a storm.\n\nThen, listening in the silence, away from the other side of the island,\nthey heard a sound like the droning of a great top.\n\nIt was the centre of the cyclone approaching.\n\nA cyclone is a circular storm: a storm in the form of a ring. This ring\nof hurricane travels across the ocean with inconceivable speed and\nfury, yet its centre is a haven of peace.\n\nAs they listened the sound increased, sharpened, and became a tang that\npierced the ear-drums: a sound that shook with hurry and speed,\nincreasing, bringing with it the bursting and crashing of trees, and\nbreaking at last overhead in a yell that stunned the brain like the\nblow of a bludgeon. In a second the house was torn away, and they were\nclinging to the roots of the breadfruit, deaf, blinded, half-lifeless.\n\nThe terror and the prolonged shock of it reduced them from thinking\nbeings to the level of frightened animals whose one instinct is\npreservation.\n\nHow long the horror lasted they could not tell, when, like a madman who\npauses for a moment in the midst of his struggles and stands\nstock-still, the wind ceased blowing, and there was peace. The centre\nof the cyclone was passing over the island.\n\nLooking up, one saw a marvellous sight. The air was full of birds,\nbutterflies, insects—all hanging in the heart of the storm and\ntravelling with it under its protection.\n\nThough the air was still as the air of a summer’s day, from north,\nsouth, east, and west, from every point of the compass, came the yell\nof the hurricane.\n\nThere was something shocking in this.\n\nIn a storm one is so beaten about by the wind that one has no time to\nthink: one is half stupefied. But in the dead centre of a cyclone one\nis in perfect peace. The trouble is all around, but it is not here. One\nhas time to examine the thing like a tiger in a cage, listen to its\nvoice and shudder at its ferocity.\n\nThe girl, holding the baby to her breast, sat up gasping. The baby had\ncome to no harm; it had cried at first when the thunder broke, but now\nit seemed impassive, almost dazed. Dick stepped from under the tree and\nlooked at the prodigy in the air.\n\nThe cyclone had gathered on its way sea-birds and birds from the land;\nthere were gulls, electric white and black man-of-war birds,\nbutterflies, and they all seemed imprisoned under a great drifting dome\nof glass. As they went, travelling like things without volition and in\na dream, with a hum and a roar the south-west quadrant of the cyclone\nburst on the island, and the whole bitter business began over again.\n\nIt lasted for hours, then towards midnight the wind fell; and when the\nsun rose next morning he came through a cloudless sky, without a trace\nof apology for the destruction caused by his children the winds. He\nshowed trees uprooted and birds lying dead, three or four canes\nremaining of what had once been a house, the lagoon the colour of a\npale sapphire, and a glass-green, foam-capped sea racing in thunder\nagainst the reef.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE STRICKEN WOODS\n\nAt first they thought they were ruined; then Dick, searching, found the\nold saw under a tree, and the butcher’s knife near it, as though the\nknife and saw had been trying to escape in company and had failed.\n\nBit by bit they began to recover something of their scattered property.\nThe remains of the flannel had been taken by the cyclone and wrapped\nround and round a slender cocoa-nut tree, till the trunk looked like a\ngaily-bandaged leg. The box of fishhooks had been jammed into the\ncentre of a cooked breadfruit, both having been picked up by the\nfingers of the wind and hurled against the same tree; and the stay-sail\nof the _Shenandoah_ was out on the reef, with a piece of coral carefully\nplaced on it as if to keep it down. As for the lug-sail belonging to\nthe dinghy, it was never seen again.\n\nThere is humour sometimes in a cyclone, if you can only appreciate it;\nno other form of air disturbance produces such quaint effects. Beside\nthe great main whirlpool of wind, there are subsidiary whirlpools, each\nactuated by its own special imp.\n\nEmmeline had felt Hannah nearly snatched from her arms twice by these\nlittle ferocious gimlet winds; and that the whole business of the great\nstorm was set about with the object of snatching Hannah from her, and\nblowing him out to sea, was a belief which she held, perhaps, in the\ninnermost recesses of her mind.\n\nThe dinghy would have been utterly destroyed, had it not heeled over\nand sunk in shallow water at the first onset of the wind; as it was,\nDick was able to bail it out at the next low tide, when it floated as\nbravely as ever, not having started a single seam.\n\nBut the destruction amidst the trees was pitiful. Looking at the woods\nas a mass, one noticed gaps here and there, but what had really\nhappened could not be seen till one was amongst the trees. Great,\nbeautiful cocoa-nut palms, not dead, but just dying, lay crushed and\nbroken as if trampled upon by some enormous foot. You would come\nacross half a dozen lianas twisted into one great cable. Where\ncocoa-nut palms were, you could not move a yard without kicking against\na fallen nut; you might have picked up full-grown, half-grown, and wee\nbaby nuts, not bigger than small apples, for on the same tree you will\nfind nuts of all sizes and conditions.\n\nOne never sees a perfectly straight-stemmed cocoa-palm; they all have\nan inclination from the perpendicular more or less; perhaps that is why\na cyclone has more effect on them than on other trees.\n\nArtus, once so pretty a picture with their diamond-chequered trunks,\nlay broken and ruined; and right through the belt of mammee apple,\nright through the bad lands, lay a broad road, as if an army, horse,\nfoot, and artillery, had passed that way from lagoon edge to lagoon\nedge. This was the path left by the great fore-foot of the storm; but\nhad you searched the woods on either side, you would have found paths\nwhere the lesser winds had been at work, where the baby whirlwinds had\nbeen at play.\n\nFrom the bruised woods, like an incense offered to heaven, rose a\nperfume of blossoms gathered and scattered, of rain-wet leaves, of\nlianas twisted and broken and oozing their sap; the perfume of\nnewly-wrecked and ruined trees—the essence and soul of the artu, the\nbanyan and cocoa-palm cast upon the wind.\n\nYou would have found dead butterflies in the woods, dead birds too; but\nin the great path of the storm you would have found dead butterflies’\nwings, feathers, leaves frayed as if by fingers, branches of the aoa,\nand sticks of the hibiscus broken into little fragments.\n\nPowerful enough to rip a ship open, root up a tree, half ruin a city.\nDelicate enough to tear a butterfly wing from wing—that is a cyclone.\n\nEmmeline, wandering about in the woods with Dick on the day after the\nstorm, looking at the ruin of great tree and little bird, and\nrecollecting the land birds she had caught a glimpse of yesterday being\ncarried along safely by the storm out to sea to be drowned, felt a\ngreat weight lifting from her heart. Mischance had come, and spared\nthem and the baby. The blue had spoken, but had not called them.\n\nShe felt that something—the something which we in civilisation call\nFate—was for the present gorged; and, without being annihilated, her\nincessant hypochondriacal dread condensed itself into a point, leaving\nher horizon sunlit and clear.\n\nThe cyclone had indeed treated them almost, one might say, amiably. It\nhad taken the house—but that was a small matter, for it had left them\nnearly all their small possessions. The tinder box and flint and steel\nwould have been a much more serious loss than a dozen houses, for,\nwithout it, they would have had absolutely no means of making a fire.\n\nIf anything, the cyclone had been almost too kind to them; had let them\npay off too little of that mysterious debt they owed to the gods.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nA FALLEN IDOL\n\nThe next day Dick began to rebuild the house. He had fetched the\nstay-sail from the reef and rigged up a temporary tent.\n\nIt was a great business cutting the canes and dragging them out in the\nopen. Emmeline helped; whilst Hannah, seated on the grass, played with\nthe bird that had vanished during the storm, but reappeared the evening\nafter.\n\nThe child and the bird had grown fast friends; they were friendly\nenough even at first, but now the bird would sometimes let the tiny\nhands clasp him right round his body—at least, as far as the hands\nwould go.\n\nIt is a rare experience for a man to hold a tame and unstruggling and\nunfrightened bird in his hands; next to pressing a woman in his arms,\nit is the pleasantest tactile sensation he will ever experience,\nperhaps, in life. He will feel a desire to press it to his heart, if he\nhas such a thing.\n\nHannah would press Koko to his little brown stomach, as if in artless\nadmission of where his heart lay.\n\nHe was an extraordinarily bright and intelligent child. He did not\npromise to be talkative, for, having achieved the word “Dick,” he\nrested content for a long while before advancing further into the\nlabyrinth of language; but though he did not use his tongue, he spoke\nin a host of other ways. With his eyes, that were as bright as Koko’s,\nand full of all sorts of mischief; with his hands and feet and the\nmovements of his body. He had a way of shaking his hands before him\nwhen highly delighted, a way of expressing nearly all the shades of\npleasure; and though he rarely expressed anger, when he did so, he\nexpressed it fully.\n\nHe was just now passing over the frontier into toyland. In civilisation\nhe would no doubt have been the possessor of an india-rubber dog or a\nwoolly lamb, but there were no toys here at all. Emmeline’s old doll\nhad been left behind when they took flight from the other side of the\nisland, and Dick, a year or so ago, on one of his expeditions, had\nfound it lying half buried in the sand of the beach.\n\nHe had brought it back now more as a curiosity than anything else, and\nthey had kept it on the shelf in the house. The cyclone had impaled it\non a tree-twig near by, as if in derision; and Hannah, when it was\npresented to him as a plaything, flung it away from him as if in\ndisgust. But he would play with flowers or bright shells, or bits of\ncoral, making vague patterns with them on the sward.\n\nAll the toy lambs in the world would not have pleased him better than\nthose things, the toys of the Troglodyte children—the children of the\nStone Age. To clap two oyster shells together and make a noise—what,\nafter all, could a baby want better than that?\n\nOne afternoon, when the house was beginning to take some sort of form,\nthey ceased work and went off into the woods; Emmeline carrying the\nbaby, and Dick taking turns with him. They were going to the valley of\nthe idol.\n\nSince the coming of Hannah, and even before, the stone figure standing\nin its awful and mysterious solitude had ceased to be an object of\ndread to Emmeline, and had become a thing vaguely benevolent. Love had\ncome to her under its shade; and under its shade the spirit of the\nchild had entered into her—from where, who knows? But certainly through\nheaven.\n\nPerhaps the thing which had been the god of some unknown people had\ninspired her with the instinct of religion; if so, she was his last\nworshipper on earth, for when they entered the valley they found him\nlying upon his face. Great blocks of stone lay around him: there had\nevidently been a landslip, a catastrophe preparing for ages, and\ndetermined, perhaps, by the torrential rain of the cyclone.\n\nIn Ponape, Huahine, in Easter Island, you may see great idols that have\nbeen felled like this, temples slowly dissolving from sight, and\nterraces, seemingly as solid as the hills, turning softly and subtly\ninto shapeless mounds of stone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTHE EXPEDITION\n\nNext morning the light of day filtering through the trees awakened\nEmmeline in the tent which they had improvised whilst the house was\nbuilding. Dawn came later here than on the other side of the island\nwhich faced east—later, and in a different manner—for there is the\ndifference of worlds between dawn coming over a wooded hill, and dawn\ncoming over the sea.\n\nOver at the other side, sitting on the sand with the break of the reef\nwhich faced the east before you, scarcely would the east change colour\nbefore the sea-line would be on fire, the sky lit up into an\nillimitable void of blue, and the sunlight flooding into the lagoon,\nthe ripples of light seeming to chase the ripples of water.\n\nOn this side it was different. The sky would be dark and full of stars,\nand the woods, great spaces of velvety shadow. Then through the leaves\nof the artu would come a sigh, and the leaves of the breadfruit would\npatter, and the sound of the reef become faint. The land breeze had\nawakened, and in a while, as if it had blown them away, looking up, you\nwould find the stars gone, and the sky a veil of palest blue. In this\nindirect approach of dawn there was something ineffably mysterious. One\ncould see, but the things seen were indecisive and vague, just as they\nare in the gloaming of an English summer’s day.\n\nScarcely had Emmeline arisen when Dick woke also, and they went out on\nto the sward, and then down to the water’s edge. Dick went in for a\nswim, and the girl, holding the baby, stood on the bank watching him.\n\nAlways after a great storm the weather of the island would become more\nbracing and exhilarating, and this morning the air seemed filled with\nthe spirit of spring. Emmeline felt it, and as she watched the swimmer\ndisporting in the water, she laughed, and held the child up to watch\nhim. She was fey. The breeze, filled with all sorts of sweet perfumes\nfrom the woods, blew her black hair about her shoulders, and the full\nlight of morning coming over the palm fronds of the woods beyond the\nsward touched her and the child. Nature seemed caressing them.\n\nDick came ashore, and then ran about to dry himself in the wind. Then\nhe went to the dinghy and examined her; for he had determined to leave\nthe house-building for half a day, and row round to the old place to\nsee how the banana trees had fared during the storm. His anxiety about\nthem was not to be wondered at. The island was his larder, and the\nbananas were a most valuable article of food. He had all the feelings\nof a careful housekeeper about them, and he could not rest till he had\nseen for himself the extent of damage, if damage there was any.\n\nHe examined the boat, and then they all went back to breakfast. Living\ntheir lives, they had to use forethought. They would put away, for\ninstance, all the shells of the cocoa-nuts they used for fuel; and you\nnever could imagine the blazing splendour there lives in the shell of a\ncocoa-nut till you see it burning. Yesterday, Dick, with his usual\nprudence, had placed a heap of sticks, all wet with the rain of the\nstorm, to dry in the sun: as a consequence, they had plenty of fuel to\nmake a fire with this morning.\n\nWhen they had finished breakfast he got the knife to cut the bananas\nwith—if there were any left to cut—and, taking the javelin, he went\ndown to the boat, followed by Emmeline and the child.\n\nDick had stepped into the boat, and was on the point of unmooring her,\nand pushing her off, when Emmeline stopped him.\n\n“Dick!”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“I will go with you.”\n\n“You!” said he in astonishment.\n\n“Yes, I’m—not afraid any more.”\n\nIt was a fact; since the coming of the child she had lost that dread of\nthe other side of the island—or almost lost it.\n\nDeath is a great darkness, birth is a great light—they had intermixed\nin her mind; the darkness was still there, but it was no longer\nterrible to her, for it was infused with the light. The result was a\ntwilight sad, but beautiful, and unpeopled with forms of fear.\n\nYears ago she had seen a mysterious door close and shut a human being\nout for ever from the world. The sight had filled her with dread\nunimaginable, for she had no words for the thing, no religion or\nphilosophy to explain it away or gloss it over. Just recently she had\nseen an equally mysterious door open and admit a human being; and deep\ndown in her mind, in the place where the dreams were, the one great\nfact had explained and justified the other. Life had vanished into the\nvoid, but life had come from there. There was life in the void, and it\nwas no longer terrible.\n\nPerhaps all religions were born on a day when some woman, seated upon a\nrock by the prehistoric sea, looked at her newborn child and recalled\nto mind her man who had been slain, thus closing the charm and\nimprisoning the idea of a future state.\n\nEmmeline, with the child in her arms, stepped into the little boat and\ntook her seat in the stern, whilst Dick pushed off. Scarcely had he put\nout the sculls than a new passenger arrived. It was Koko. He would\noften accompany them to the reef, though, strangely enough, he would\nnever go there alone of his own accord. He made a circle or two over\nthem, and then lit on the gunwale in the bow, and perched there, humped\nup, and with his long dove-coloured tail feathers presented to the\nwater.\n\nThe oarsman kept close in-shore, and as they rounded the little cape\nall gay with wild cocoa-nut the bushes brushed the boat, and the child,\nexcited by their colour, held out his hands to them. Emmeline\nstretched out her hand and broke off a branch; but it was not a branch\nof the wild cocoa-nut she had plucked, it was a branch of the\nnever-wake-up berries. The berries that will cause a man to sleep,\nshould he eat of them—to sleep and dream, and never wake up again.\n\n“Throw them away!” cried Dick, who remembered.\n\n“I will in a minute,” she replied.\n\nShe was holding them up before the child, who was laughing and trying\nto grasp them. Then she forgot them, and dropped them in the bottom of\nthe boat, for something had struck the keel with a thud, and the water\nwas boiling all round.\n\nThere was a savage fight going on below. In the breeding season great\nbattles would take place sometimes in the lagoon, for fish have their\njealousies just like men—love affairs, friendships. The two great\nforms could be dimly perceived, one in pursuit of the other, and they\nterrified Emmeline, who implored Dick to row on.\n\nThey slipped by the pleasant shores that Emmeline had never seen\nbefore, having been sound asleep when they came past them those years\nago.\n\nJust before putting off she had looked back at the beginnings of the\nlittle house under the artu tree, and as she looked at the strange\nglades and groves, the picture of it rose before her, and seemed to\ncall her back.\n\nIt was a tiny possession, but it was home; and so little used to change\nwas she that already a sort of home-sickness was upon her; but it\npassed away almost as soon as it came, and she fell to wondering at the\nthings around her, and pointing them out to the child.\n\nWhen they came to the place where Dick had hooked the albicore, he hung\non his oars and told her about it. It was the first time she had heard\nof it; a fact which shows into what a state of savagery he had been\nlapsing. He had mentioned about the canoes, for he had to account for\nthe javelin; but as for telling her of the incidents of the chase, he\nno more thought of doing so than a red Indian would think of detailing\nto his squaw the incidents of a bear hunt. Contempt for women is the\nfirst law of savagery, and perhaps the last law of some old and\nprofound philosophy.\n\nShe listened, and when it came to the incident of the shark, she\nshuddered.\n\n“I wish I had a hook big enough to catch him with,” said he, staring\ninto the water as if in search of his enemy.\n\n“Don’t think of him, Dick,” said Emmeline, holding the child more\ntightly to her heart. “Row on.”\n\nHe resumed the sculls, but you could have seen from his face that he\nwas recounting to himself the incident.\n\nWhen they had rounded the last promontory, and the strand and the break\nin the reef opened before them, Emmeline caught her breath. The place\nhad changed in some subtle manner; everything was there as before, yet\neverything seemed different—the lagoon seemed narrower, the reef\nnearer, the cocoa-palms not nearly so tall. She was contrasting the\nreal things with the recollection of them when seen by a child. The\nblack speck had vanished from the reef; the storm had swept it utterly\naway.\n\nDick beached the boat on the shelving sand, and left Emmeline seated in\nthe stern of it, whilst he went in search of the bananas; she would\nhave accompanied him, but the child had fallen asleep.\n\nHannah asleep was even a pleasanter picture than when awake. He looked\nlike a little brown Cupid without wings, bow or arrow. He had all the\ngrace of a curled-up feather. Sleep was always in pursuit of him, and\nwould catch him up at the most unexpected moments—when he was at play,\nor indeed at any time. Emmeline would sometimes find him with a\ncoloured shell or bit of coral that he had been playing with in his\nhand fast asleep, a happy expression on his face, as if his mind were\npursuing its earthly avocations on some fortunate beach in dreamland.\n\nDick had plucked a huge breadfruit leaf and given it to her as a\nshelter from the sun, and she sat holding it over her, and gazing\nstraight before her, over the white, sunlit sands.\n\nThe flight of the mind in reverie is not in a direct line. To her,\ndreaming as she sat, came all sorts of coloured pictures, recalled by\nthe scene before her: the green water under the stern of a ship, and\nthe word _Shenandoah_ vaguely reflected on it; their landing, and the\nlittle tea-set spread out on the white sand—she could still see the\npansies painted on the plates, and she counted in memory the lead\nspoons; the great stars that burned over the reef at nights; the\nCluricaunes and fairies; the cask by the well where the convolvulus\nblossomed, and the wind-blown trees seen from the summit of the\nhill—all these pictures drifted before her, dissolving and replacing\neach other as they went.\n\nThere was sadness in the contemplation of them, but pleasure too. She\nfelt at peace with the world. All trouble seemed far behind her. It was\nas if the great storm that had left them unharmed had been an\nambassador from the powers above to assure her of their forbearance,\nprotection, and love.\n\nAll at once she noticed that between the boat’s bow and the sand there\nlay a broad, blue, sparkling line. The dinghy was afloat.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHE KEEPER OF THE LAGOON\n\nThe woods here had been less affected by the cyclone than those upon\nthe other side of the island, but there had been destruction enough. To\nreach the place he wanted, Dick had to climb over felled trees and\nfight his way through a tangle of vines that had once hung overhead.\n\nThe banana trees had not suffered at all; as if by some special\ndispensation of Providence even the great bunches of fruit had been\nscarcely injured, and he proceeded to climb and cut them. He cut two\nbunches, and with one across his shoulder came back down through the\ntrees.\n\nHe had got half across the sands, his head bent under the load, when a\ndistant call came to him, and, raising his head, he saw the boat adrift\nin the middle of the lagoon, and the figure of the girl in the bow of\nit waving to him with her arm. He saw a scull floating on the water\nhalf-way between the boat and the shore, which she had no doubt lost in\nan attempt to paddle the boat back. He remembered that the tide was\ngoing out.\n\nHe flung his load aside, and ran down the beach; in a moment he was in\nthe water. Emmeline, standing up in the boat, watched him.\n\nWhen she found herself adrift, she had made an effort to row back, and\nin her hurry shipping the sculls she had lost one. With a single scull\nshe was quite helpless, as she had not the art of sculling a boat from\nthe stern. At first she was not frightened, because she knew that Dick\nwould soon return to her assistance; but as the distance between boat\nand shore increased, a cold hand seemed laid upon her heart. Looking at\nthe shore it seemed very far away, and the view towards the reef was\nterrific, for the opening had increased in apparent size, and the great\nsea beyond seemed drawing her to it.\n\nShe saw Dick coming out of the wood with the load on his shoulder, and\nshe called to him. At first he did not seem to hear, then she saw him\nlook up, cast the bananas away, and come running down the sand to the\nwater’s edge. She watched him swimming, she saw him seize the scull,\nand her heart gave a great leap of joy.\n\nTowing the scull and swimming with one arm, he rapidly approached the\nboat. He was quite close, only ten feet away, when Emmeline saw behind\nhim, shearing through the clear, rippling water and advancing with\nspeed, a dark triangle that seemed made of canvas stretched upon a\nsword point.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\nForty years ago he had floated adrift on the sea in the form and\nlikeness of a small shabby pine-cone, a prey to anything that might\nfind him. He had escaped the jaws of the dog-fish, and the jaws of the\ndog-fish are a very wide door; he had escaped the albicore and squid:\nhis life had been one long series of miraculous escapes from death. Out\nof a billion like him born in the same year, he and a few others only\nhad survived.\n\nFor thirty years he had kept the lagoon to himself, as a ferocious\ntiger keeps a jungle. He had known the palm tree on the reef when it\nwas a seedling, and he had known the reef even before the palm tree was\nthere. The things he had devoured, flung one upon another, would have\nmade a mountain; yet he was as clear of enmity as a sword, as cruel, and\nas soulless. He was the spirit of the lagoon.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\nEmmeline screamed, and pointed to the thing behind the swimmer. He\nturned, saw it, dropped the oar and made for the boat. She had seized\nthe remaining scull and stood with it poised, then she hurled it blade\nforemost at the form in the water, now fully visible, and close on its\nprey.\n\nShe could not throw a stone straight, yet the scull went like an arrow\nto the mark, balking the pursuer and saving the pursued. In a moment\nmore his leg was over the gunwale, and he was saved.\n\nBut the scull was lost.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE HAND OF THE SEA\n\nThere was nothing in the boat that could possibly be used as a paddle;\nthe scull was only five or six yards away, but to attempt to swim to it\nwas certain death, yet they were being swept out to sea. He might have\nmade the attempt, only that on the starboard quarter the form of the\nshark, gently swimming at the same pace as they were drifting, could be\nmade out only half veiled by the water.\n\nThe bird perched on the gunwale seemed to divine their trouble, for he\nrose in the air, made a circle, and resumed his perch with all his\nfeathers ruffled.\n\nDick stood in despair, helpless, his hands clasping his head. The shore\nwas drawing away before him, the surf loudening behind him, yet he\ncould do nothing. The island was being taken away from them by the\ngreat hand of the sea.\n\nThen, suddenly, the little boat entered the race formed by the\nconfluence of the tides, from the right and left arms of the lagoon;\nthe sound of the surf suddenly increased as though a door had been\nflung open. The breakers were falling and the sea-gulls crying on\neither side of them, and for a moment the ocean seemed to hesitate as\nto whether they were to be taken away into her wastes, or dashed on the\ncoral strand. Only for a moment this seeming hesitation lasted; then\nthe power of the tide prevailed over the power of the swell, and the\nlittle boat taken by the current drifted gently out to sea.\n\nDick flung himself down beside Emmeline, who was seated in the bottom\nof the boat holding the child to her breast. The bird, seeing the land\nretreat, and wise in its instinct, rose into the air. It circled\nthrice round the drifting boat, and then, like a beautiful but\nfaithless spirit, passed away to the shore.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTOGETHER\n\nThe island had sunk slowly from sight; at sundown it was just a trace,\na stain on the south-western horizon. It was before the new moon, and\nthe little boat lay drifting. It drifted from the light of sunset into\na world of vague violet twilight, and now it lay drifting under the\nstars.\n\nThe girl, clasping the baby to her breast, leaned against her\ncompanion’s shoulder; neither of them spoke. All the wonders in their\nshort existence had culminated in this final wonder, this passing away\ntogether from the world of Time. This strange voyage they had embarked\non—to where?\n\nNow that the first terror was over they felt neither sorrow nor fear.\nThey were together. Come what might, nothing could divide them; even\nshould they sleep and never wake up, they would sleep together. Had one\nbeen left and the other taken!\n\nAs though the thought had occurred to them simultaneously, they turned\none to the other, and their lips met, their souls met, mingling in one\ndream; whilst above in the windless heaven space answered space with\nflashes of siderial light, and Canopus shone and burned like the\npointed sword of Azrael.\n\nClasped in Emmeline’s hand was the last and most mysterious gift of the\nmysterious world they had known—the branch of crimson berries.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nMAD LESTRANGE\n\nThey knew him upon the Pacific slope as “Mad Lestrange.” He was not\nmad, but he was a man with a fixed idea. He was pursued by a vision:\nthe vision of two children and an old sailor adrift in a little boat\nupon a wide blue sea.\n\nWhen the _Arago_, bound for Papetee, picked up the boats of the\n_Northumberland_, only the people in the long-boat were alive. Le Farge,\nthe captain, was mad, and he never recovered his reason. Lestrange was\nutterly shattered; the awful experience in the boats and the loss of\nthe children had left him a seemingly helpless wreck. The scowbankers,\nlike all their class, had fared better, and in a few days were about\nthe ship and sitting in the sun. Four days after the rescue the _Arago_\nspoke the _Newcastle_, bound for San Francisco, and transhipped the\nshipwrecked men.\n\nHad a physician seen Lestrange on board the _Northumberland_ as she lay\nin that long, long calm before the fire, he would have declared that\nnothing but a miracle could prolong his life. The miracle came about.\n\nIn the general hospital of San Francisco, as the clouds cleared from\nhis mind, they unveiled the picture of the children and the little\nboat. The picture had been there daily, seen but not truly\ncomprehended; the horrors gone through in the open boat, the sheer\nphysical exhaustion, had merged all the accidents of the great disaster\ninto one mournful half-comprehended fact. When his brain cleared all\nthe other incidents fell out of focus, and memory, with her eyes set\nupon the children, began to paint a picture that he was ever more to\nsee.\n\nMemory cannot produce a picture that Imagination has not retouched; and\nher pictures, even the ones least touched by Imagination, are no mere\nphotographs, but the work of an artist. All that is inessential she\ncasts away, all that is essential she retains; she idealises, and that\nis why her picture of a lost mistress has had power to keep a man a\ncelibate to the end of his days, and why she can break a human heart\nwith the picture of a dead child. She is a painter, but she is also a\npoet.\n\nThe picture before the mind of Lestrange was filled with this almost\ndiabolical poetry, for in it the little boat and her helpless crew were\nrepresented adrift on a blue and sunlit sea. A sea most beautiful to\nlook at, yet most terrible, bearing as it did the recollections of\nthirst.\n\nHe had been dying, when, raising himself on his elbow, so to say, he\nlooked at this picture. It recalled him to life. His willpower asserted\nitself, and he refused to die.\n\nThe will of a man has, if it is strong enough, the power to reject\ndeath. He was not in the least conscious of the exercise of this power;\nhe only knew that a great and absorbing interest had suddenly arisen in\nhim, and that a great aim stood before him—the recovery of the\nchildren.\n\nThe disease that was killing him ceased its ravages, or rather was\nslain in its turn by the increased vitality against which it had to\nstrive. He left the hospital and took up his quarters at the Palace\nHotel, and then, like the General of an army, he began to formulate his\nplan of campaign against Fate.\n\nWhen the crew of the _Northumberland_ had stampeded, hurling their\nofficers aside, lowering the boats with a rush, and casting themselves\ninto the sea, everything had been lost in the way of ship’s papers; the\ncharts, the two logs—everything, in fact, that could indicate the\nlatitude and longitude of the disaster. The first and second officers\nand a midshipman had shared the fate of the quarter-boat; of the\nforemast hands saved, not one, of course, could give the slightest\nhint as to the locality of the spot.\n\nA time reckoning from the Horn told little, for there was no record of\nthe log. All that could be said was that the disaster had occurred\nsomewhere south of the line.\n\nIn Le Farge’s brain lay for a certainty the position, and Lestrange\nwent to see the captain in the “Maison de Sante,” where he was being\nlooked after, and found him quite recovered from the furious mania that\nhe had been suffering from. Quite recovered, and playing with a ball of\ncoloured worsted.\n\nThere remained the log of the _Arago_; in it would be found the latitude\nand longitude of the boats she had picked up.\n\nThe _Arago_, due at Papetee, became overdue. Lestrange watched the\noverdue lists from day to day, from week to week, from month to month,\nuselessly, for the _Arago_ never was heard of again. One could not affirm\neven that she was wrecked; she was simply one of the ships that never\ncome back from the sea.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE SECRET OF THE AZURE\n\nTo lose a child he loves is undoubtedly the greatest catastrophe that\ncan happen to a man. I do not refer to its death.\n\nA child wanders into the street, or is left by its nurse for a moment,\nand vanishes. At first the thing is not realised. There is a pang and\nhurry at the heart which half vanishes, whilst the understanding\nexplains that in a civilised city, if a child gets lost, it will be\nfound and brought back by the neighbours or the police.\n\nBut the police know nothing of the matter, or the neighbours, and the\nhours pass. Any minute may bring back the wanderer; but the minutes\npass, and the day wears into evening, and the evening to night, and the\nnight to dawn, and the common sounds of a new day begin.\n\nYou cannot remain at home for restlessness; you go out, only to return\nhurriedly for news. You are eternally listening, and what you hear\nshocks you; the common sounds of life, the roll of the carts and cabs\nin the street, the footsteps of the passers-by, are full of an\nindescribable mournfulness; music increases your misery into madness,\nand the joy of others is monstrous as laughter heard in hell.\n\nIf some one were to bring you the dead body of the child, you might\nweep, but you would bless him, for it is the uncertainty that kills.\n\nYou go mad, or go on living. Years pass by, and you are an old man.\nYou say to yourself: “He would have been twenty years of age to-day.”\n\nThere is not in the old ferocious penal code of our forefathers a\npunishment adequate to the case of the man or woman who steals a child.\n\nLestrange was a wealthy man, and one hope remained to him, that the\nchildren might have been rescued by some passing ship. It was not the\ncase of children lost in a city, but in the broad Pacific, where ships\ntravel from all ports to all ports, and to advertise his loss\nadequately it was necessary to placard the world. Ten thousand dollars\nwas the reward offered for news of the lost ones, twenty thousand for\nthe recovery; and the advertisement appeared in every newspaper\nlikely to reach the eyes of a sailor, from the _Liverpool Post_ to\nthe _Dead Bird_.\n\nThe years passed without anything definite coming in answer to all\nthese advertisements. Once news came of two children saved from the sea\nin the neighbourhood of the Gilberts, and it was not false news, but\nthey were not the children he was seeking for. This incident at once\ndepressed and stimulated him, for it seemed to say, “If these children\nhave been saved, why not yours?”\n\nThe strange thing was, that in his heart he felt a certainty that they\nwere alive. His intellect suggested their death in twenty different\nforms; but a whisper, somewhere out of that great blue ocean, told him\nat intervals that what he sought was there, living, and waiting for him.\n\nHe was somewhat of the same temperament as Emmeline—a dreamer, with a\nmind tuned to receive and record the fine rays that fill this world\nflowing from intellect to intellect, and even from what we call\ninanimate things. A coarser nature would, though feeling, perhaps, as\nacutely the grief, have given up in despair the search. But he kept on;\nand at the end of the fifth year, so far from desisting, he chartered a\nschooner and passed eighteen months in a fruitless search, calling at\nlittle-known islands, and once, unknowing, at an island only three\nhundred miles away from the tiny island of this story.\n\nIf you wish to feel the hopelessness of this unguided search, do not\nlook at a map of the Pacific, but go there. Hundreds and hundreds of\nthousands of square leagues of sea, thousands of islands, reefs, atolls.\n\nUp to a few years ago there were many small islands utterly unknown;\neven still there are some, though the charts of the Pacific are the\ngreatest triumphs of hydrography; and though the island of the story\nwas actually on the Admiralty charts, of what use was that fact to\nLestrange?\n\nHe would have continued searching, but he dared not, for the desolation\nof the sea had touched him.\n\nIn that eighteen months the Pacific explained itself to him in part,\nexplained its vastness, its secrecy and inviolability. The schooner\nlifted veil upon veil of distance, and veil upon veil lay beyond. He\ncould only move in a right line; to search the wilderness of water with\nany hope, one would have to be endowed with the gift of moving in all\ndirections at once.\n\nHe would often lean over the bulwark rail and watch the swell slip by,\nas if questioning the water. Then the sunsets began to weigh upon his\nheart, and the stars to speak to him in a new language, and he knew\nthat it was time to return, if he would return with a whole mind.\n\nWhen he got back to San Francisco he called upon his agent, Wannamaker\nof Kearney Street, but there was still no news.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nCAPTAIN FOUNTAIN\n\nHe had a suite of rooms at the Palace Hotel, and he lived the life of\nany other rich man who is not addicted to pleasure. He knew some of the\nbest people in the city, and conducted himself so sanely in all\nrespects that a casual stranger would never have guessed his reputation\nfor madness; but when you knew him better, you would find sometimes in\nthe middle of a conversation that his mind was away from the subject;\nand were you to follow him in the street, you would hear him in\nconversation with himself. Once at a dinner-party he rose and left the\nroom, and did not return. Trifles, but sufficient to establish a\nreputation of a sort.\n\nOne morning—to be precise, it was the second day of May, exactly eight\nyears and five months after the wreck of the _Northumberland_—Lestrange\nwas in his sitting-room reading, when the bell of the telephone, which\nstood in the corner of the room, rang. He went to the instrument.\n\n“Are you there?” came a high American voice. “Lestrange—right—come\ndown and see me—Wannamaker—I have news for you.”\n\nLestrange held the receiver for a moment, then he put it back in the\nrest. He went to a chair and sat down, holding his head between his\nhands, then he rose and went to the telephone again; but he dared not\nuse it, he dare not shatter the newborn hope.\n\n“News!” What a world lies in that word.\n\nIn Kearney Street he stood before the door of Wannamaker’s office\ncollecting himself and watching the crowd drifting by, then he entered\nand went up the stairs. He pushed open a swing-door and entered a great\nroom. The clink and rattle of a dozen typewriters filled the place, and\nall the hurry of business; clerks passed and came with sheaves of\ncorrespondence in their hands; and Wannamaker himself, rising from\nbending over a message which he was correcting on one of the\ntypewriters’ tables, saw the newcomer and led him to the private office.\n\n“What is it?” said Lestrange.\n\n“Only this,” said the other, taking up a slip of paper with a name and\naddress on it. “Simon J. Fountain, of 45 Rathray Street, West—that’s\ndown near the wharves—says he has seen your ad. in an old number of a\npaper, and he thinks he can tell you something. He did not specify the\nnature of the intelligence, but it might be worth finding out.”\n\n“I will go there,” said Lestrange.\n\n“Do you know Rathray Street?”\n\n“No.”\n\nWannamaker went out and called a boy and gave him some directions; then\nLestrange and the boy started.\n\nLestrange left the office without saying “Thank you,” or taking leave\nin any way of the advertising agent—who did not feel in the least\naffronted, for he knew his customer.\n\nRathray Street is, or was before the earthquake, a street of small\nclean houses. It had a seafaring look that was accentuated by the\nmarine perfumes from the wharves close by and the sound of steam\nwinches loading or discharging cargo—a sound that ceased not night\nor day as the work went on beneath the sun or the sizzling arc lamps.\n\nNo. 45 was almost exactly like its fellows, neither better nor worse;\nand the door was opened by a neat, prim woman, small, and of middle\nage. Commonplace she was, no doubt, but not commonplace to Lestrange.\n\n“Is Mr Fountain in?” he asked. “I have come about the advertisement.”\n\n“Oh, have you, sir?” she replied, making way for him to enter, and\nshowing him into a little sitting-room on the left of the passage.\n“The Captain is in bed; he is a great invalid, but he was expecting,\nperhaps, some one would call, and he will be able to see you in a\nminute, if you don’t mind waiting.”\n\n“Thanks,” said Lestrange; “I can wait.”\n\nHe had waited eight years, what mattered a few minutes now? But at no\ntime in the eight years had he suffered such suspense, for his heart\nknew that now, just now in this commonplace little house, from the lips\nof, perhaps, the husband of that commonplace woman, he was going to\nlearn either what he feared to hear, or what he hoped.\n\nIt was a depressing little room; it was so clean, and looked as though\nit were never used. A ship imprisoned in a glass bottle stood upon the\nmantelpiece, and there were shells from far-away places, pictures of\nships in sand—all the things one finds as a rule adorning an old\nsailor’s home.\n\nLestrange, as he sat waiting, could hear movements from the next\nroom—probably the invalid’s, which they were preparing for his\nreception. The distant sounds of the derricks and winches came muffled\nthrough the tightly-shut window that looked as though it never had been\nopened. A square of sunlight lit the upper part of the cheap lace\ncurtain on the right of the window, and repeated its pattern vaguely on\nthe lower part of the wall opposite. Then a bluebottle fly awoke\nsuddenly into life and began to buzz and drum against the window pane,\nand Lestrange wished that they would come.\n\nA man of his temperament must necessarily, even under the happiest\ncircumstances, suffer in going through the world; the fine fibre always\nsuffers when brought into contact with the coarse. These people were as\nkindly disposed as any one else. The advertisement and the face and\nmanners of the visitor might have told them that it was not the time\nfor delay, yet they kept him waiting whilst they arranged bed-quilts\nand put medicine bottles straight—as if he could see!\n\nAt last the door opened, and the woman said:\n\n“Will you step this way, sir?”\n\nShe showed him into a bedroom opening off the passage. The room was\nneat and clean, and had that indescribable appearance which marks the\nbedroom of the invalid.\n\nIn the bed, making a mountain under the counterpane with an enormously\ndistended stomach, lay a man, black-bearded, and with his large,\ncapable, useless hands spread out on the coverlet—hands ready and\nwilling, but debarred from work. Without moving his body, he turned his\nhead slowly and looked at the newcomer. This slow movement was not\nfrom weakness or disease, it was the slow, emotionless nature of the\nman speaking.\n\n“This is the gentleman, Silas,” said the woman, speaking over\nLestrange’s shoulder. Then she withdrew and closed the door.\n\n“Take a chair, sir,” said the sea captain, flapping one of his hands on\nthe counterpane as if in wearied protest against his own helplessness.\n“I haven’t the pleasure of your name, but the missus tells me you’re\ncome about the advertisement I lit on yester-even.”\n\nHe took a paper, folded small, that lay beside him, and held it out to\nhis visitor. It was a _Sidney Bulletin_ three years old.\n\n“Yes,” said Lestrange, looking at the paper; “that is my advertisement.”\n\n“Well, it’s strange—very strange,” said Captain Fountain, “that I\nshould have lit on it only yesterday. I’ve had it all three years in my\nchest, the way old papers get lying at the bottom with odds and ends.\nMightn’t a’ seen it now, only the missus cleared the raffle out of the\nchest, and, ‘Give me that paper,’ I says, seeing it in her hand; and I\nfell to reading it, for a man’ll read anything bar tracts lying in bed\neight months, as I’ve been with the dropsy. I’ve been whaler man and\nboy forty year, and my last ship was the _Sea-Horse_. Over seven years\nago one of my men picked up something on a beach of one of them islands\neast of the Marquesas—we’d put in to water——”\n\n“Yes, yes,” said Lestrange. “What was it he found?”\n\n“Missus!” roared the captain in a voice that shook the walls of the\nroom.\n\nThe door opened, and the woman appeared.\n\n“Fetch me my keys out of my trousers pocket.”\n\nThe trousers were hanging up on the back of the door, as if only\nwaiting to be put on. The woman fetched the keys, and he fumbled over\nthem and found one. He handed it to her, and pointed to the drawer of a\nbureau opposite the bed.\n\nShe knew evidently what was wanted, for she opened the drawer and\nproduced a box, which she handed to him. It was a small cardboard box\ntied round with a bit of string. He undid the string, and disclosed a\nchild’s tea service: a teapot, cream jug, six little plates—all painted\nwith a pansy.\n\nIt was the box which Emmeline had always been losing—lost again.\n\nLestrange buried his face in his hands. He knew the things. Emmeline\nhad shown them to him in a burst of confidence. Out of all that vast\nocean he had searched unavailingly: they had come to him like a\nmessage, and the awe and mystery of it bowed him down and crushed him.\n\nThe captain had placed the things on the newspaper spread out by his\nside, and he was unrolling the little spoons from their tissue-paper\ncovering. He counted them as if entering up the tale of some trust, and\nplaced them on the newspaper.\n\n“When did you find them?” asked Lestrange, speaking with his face still\ncovered.\n\n“A matter of over seven years ago,” replied the captain, “we’d put in\nto water at a place south of the line—Palm Tree Island we whalemen\ncall it, because of the tree at the break of the lagoon. One of my men\nbrought it aboard, found it in a shanty built of sugar-canes which the\nmen bust up for devilment.”\n\n“Good God!” said Lestrange. “Was there no one there—nothing but this\nbox?”\n\n“Not a sight or sound, so the men said; just the shanty abandoned\nseemingly. I had no time to land and hunt for castaways, I was after\nwhales.”\n\n“How big is the island?”\n\n“Oh, a fairish middle-sized island—no natives. I’ve heard tell it’s\n_tabu_; why, the Lord only knows—some crank of the Kanakas, I s’pose.\nAnyhow, there’s the findings—you recognise them?”\n\n“I do.”\n\n“Seems strange,” said the captain, “that I should pick ’em up; seems\nstrange your advertisement out, and the answer to it lying amongst my\ngear, but that’s the way things go.”\n\n“Strange!” said the other. “It’s more than strange.”\n\n“Of course,” continued the captain, “they might have been on the island\nhid away som’ere, there’s no saying; only appearances are against it.\nOf course they might be there now unbeknownst to you or me.”\n\n“They _are_ there now,” answered Lestrange, who was sitting up and\nlooking at the playthings as though he read in them some hidden\nmessage. “They _are_ there now. Have you the position of the island?”\n\n“I have. Missus, hand me my private log.”\n\nShe took a bulky, greasy, black note-book from the bureau, and handed\nit to him. He opened it, thumbed the pages, and then read out the\nlatitude and longitude.\n\n“I entered it on the day of finding—here’s the entry. ‘Adams brought\naboard child’s toy box out of deserted shanty, which men pulled down;\ntraded it to me for a caulker of rum.’ The cruise lasted three years\nand eight months after that; we’d only been out three when it happened.\nI forgot all about it: three years scrubbing round the world after\nwhales doesn’t brighten a man’s memory. Right round we went, and paid\noff at Nantucket. Then, after a fortni’t on shore and a month\nrepairin’, the old _Sea-Horse_ was off again, I with her. It was at\nHonolulu this dropsy took me, and back I come here, home. That’s the\nyarn. There’s not much to it, but, seein’ your advertisement, I thought\nI might answer it.”\n\nLestrange took Fountain’s hand and shook it.\n\n“You see the reward I offered?” he said. “I have not my cheque book\nwith me, but you shall have the cheque in an hour from now.”\n\n“No, _sir_,” replied the captain; “if anything comes of it, I don’t say\nI’m not open to some small acknowledgment, but ten thousand dollars for\na five-cent box—that’s not my way of doing business.”\n\n“I can’t make you take the money now—I can’t even thank you properly\nnow,” said Lestrange—“I am in a fever; but when all is settled, you\nand I will settle this business. My God!”\n\nHe buried his face in his hands again.\n\n“I’m not wishing to be inquisitive,” said Captain Fountain, slowly\nputting the things back in the box and tucking the paper shavings round\nthem, “but may I ask how you propose to move in this business?”\n\n“I will hire a ship at once and search.”\n\n“Ay,” said the captain, wrapping up the little spoons in a meditative\nmanner; “perhaps that will be best.”\n\nHe felt certain in his own mind that the search would be fruitless, but\nhe did not say so. If he had been absolutely certain in his mind\nwithout being able to produce the proof, he would not have counselled\nLestrange to any other course, knowing that the man’s mind would never\nbe settled until proof positive was produced.\n\n“The question is,” said Lestrange, “what is my quickest way to get\nthere?”\n\n“There I may be able to help you,” said Fountain, tying the string round\nthe box. “A schooner with good heels to her is what you want; and, if\nI’m not mistaken, there’s one discharging cargo at this present minit\nat O’Sullivan’s wharf. Missus!”\n\nThe woman answered the call. Lestrange felt like a person in a dream,\nand these people who were interesting themselves in his affairs seemed\nto him beneficent beyond the nature of human beings.\n\n“Is Captain Stannistreet home, think you?”\n\n“I don’t know,” replied the woman; “but I can go see.”\n\n“Do.”\n\nShe went.\n\n“He lives only a few doors down,” said Fountain, “and he’s the man for\nyou. Best schooner captain ever sailed out of ’Frisco. The _Raratonga_ is\nthe name of the boat I have in my mind—best boat that ever wore\ncopper. Stannistreet is captain of her, owners are M’Vitie. She’s been\nmissionary, and she’s been pigs; copra was her last cargo, and she’s\nnearly discharged it. Oh, M’Vitie would hire her out to Satan at a\nprice; you needn’t be afraid of their boggling at it if you can raise\nthe dollars. She’s had a new suit of sails only the beginning of the\nyear. Oh, she’ll fix you up to a T, and you take the word of S.\nFountain for that. I’ll engineer the thing from this bed if you’ll let\nme put my oar in your trouble; I’ll victual her, and find a crew three\nquarter price of any of those d--d skulking agents. Oh, I’ll take a\ncommission right enough, but I’m half paid with doing the thing—”\n\nHe ceased, for footsteps sounded in the passage outside, and Captain\nStannistreet was shown in. He was a young man of not more than thirty,\nalert, quick of eye, and pleasant of face. Fountain introduced him to\nLestrange, who had taken a fancy to him at first sight.\n\nWhen he heard about the business in hand, he seemed interested at once;\nthe affair seemed to appeal to him more than if it had been a purely\ncommercial matter, such as copra and pigs.\n\n“If you’ll come with me, sir, down to the wharf, I’ll show you the boat\nnow,” he said, when they had discussed the matter and threshed it out\nthoroughly.\n\nHe rose, bid good-day to his friend Fountain, and Lestrange followed\nhim, carrying the brown-paper box in his hand.\n\nO’Sullivan’s Wharf was not far away. A tall Cape Horner that looked\nalmost a twin sister of the ill-fated _Northumberland_ was discharging\niron, and astern of her, graceful as a dream, with snow-white decks,\nlay the _Raratonga_ discharging copra.\n\n“That’s the boat,” said Stannistreet; “cargo nearly all out. How does\nshe strike your fancy?”\n\n“I’ll take her,” said Lestrange, “cost what it will.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nDUE SOUTH\n\nIt was on the 10th of May, so quickly did things move under the\nsupervision of the bedridden captain, that the _Raratonga_, with\nLestrange on board, cleared the Golden Gates, and made south, heeling\nto a ten-knot breeze.\n\nThere is no mode of travel to be compared to your sailing-ship. In a\ngreat ship, if you have ever made a voyage in one, the vast spaces of\ncanvas, the sky-high spars, the _finesse_ with which the wind is met and\ntaken advantage of, will form a memory never to be blotted out.\n\nA schooner is the queen of all rigs; she has a bounding buoyancy denied\nto the square-rigged craft, to which she stands in the same\nrelationship as a young girl to a dowager; and the _Raratonga_ was not\nonly a schooner, but the queen, acknowledged of all the schooners in\nthe Pacific.\n\nFor the first few days they made good way south; then the wind became\nbaffling and headed them off.\n\nAdded to Lestrange’s feverish excitement there was an anxiety, a deep\nand soul-fretting anxiety, as if some half-heard voice were telling him\nthat the children he sought were threatened by some danger.\n\nThese baffling winds blew upon the smouldering anxiety in his breast,\nas wind blows upon embers, causing them to glow. They lasted some days,\nand then, as if Fate had relented, up sprang on the starboard quarter a\nspanking breeze, making the rigging sing to a merry tune, and blowing\nthe spindrift from the forefoot, as the _Raratonga_, heeling to its\npressure, went humming through the sea, leaving a wake spreading behind\nher like a fan.\n\nIt took them along five hundred miles, silently and with the speed of a\ndream. Then it ceased.\n\nThe ocean and the air stood still. The sky above stood solid like a\ngreat pale blue dome; just where it met the water line of the far\nhorizon a delicate tracery of cloud draped the entire round of the sky.\n\nI have said that the ocean stood still as well as the air: to the eye\nit was so, for the swell under-running the glitter on its surface was\nso even, so equable, and so rhythmical, that the surface seemed not in\nmotion. Occasionally a dimple broke the surface, and strips of dark\nsea-weed floated by, showing up the green; dim things rose to the\nsurface, and, guessing the presence of man, sank slowly and dissolved\nfrom sight.\n\nTwo days, never to be recovered, passed, and still the calm continued.\nOn the morning of the third day it breezed up from the nor’-nor’west,\nand they continued their course, a cloud of canvas, every sail drawing,\nand the music of the ripple under the forefoot.\n\nCaptain Stannistreet was a genius in his profession; he could get more\nspeed out of a schooner than any other man afloat, and carry more\ncanvas without losing a stick. He was also, fortunately for Lestrange,\na man of refinement and education, and what was better still,\nunderstanding.\n\nThey were pacing the deck one afternoon, when Lestrange, who was\nwalking with his hands behind him, and his eyes counting the brown\ndowels in the cream-white planking, broke silence.\n\n“You don’t believe in visions and dreams?”\n\n“How do you know that?” replied the other.\n\n“Oh, I only put it as a question; most people say they don’t.”\n\n“Yes, but most people do.”\n\n“I do,” said Lestrange.\n\nHe was silent for a moment.\n\n“You know my trouble so well that I won’t bother you going over it, but\nthere has come over me of late a feeling—it is like a waking dream.”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“I can’t quite explain, for it is as if I saw something which my\nintelligence could not comprehend, or make an image of.”\n\n“I think I know what you mean.”\n\n“I don’t think you do. This is something quite strange. I am fifty, and\nin fifty years a man has experienced, as a rule, all the ordinary and\nmost of the extraordinary sensations that a human being can be\nsubjected to. Well, I have never felt this sensation before; it comes\non only at times. I see, as you might imagine, a young baby sees, and\nthings are before me that I do not comprehend. It is not through my\nbodily eyes that this sensation comes, but through some window of the\nmind, from before which a curtain has been drawn.”\n\n“That’s strange,” said Stannistreet, who did not like the conversation\nover-much, being simply a schooner captain and a plain man, though\nintelligent enough and sympathetic.\n\n“This something tells me,” went on Lestrange, “that there is danger\nthreatening the—” He ceased, paused a minute, and then, to\nStannistreet’s relief, went on. “If I talk like that you will think I\nam not right in my head: let us pass the subject by, let us forget\ndreams and omens and come to realities. You know how I lost the\nchildren; you know how I hope to find them at the place where Captain\nFountain found their traces? He says the island was uninhabited, but he\nwas not sure.”\n\n“No,” replied Stannistreet, “he only spoke of the beach.”\n\n“Yes. Well, suppose there were natives at the other side of the island\nwho had taken these children.”\n\n“If so, they would grow up with the natives.”\n\n“And become savages?”\n\n“Yes; but the Polynesians can’t be really called savages; they are a\nvery decent lot. I’ve knocked about amongst them a good while, and a\nkanaka is as white as a white man—which is not saying much, but it’s\nsomething. Most of the islands are civilised now. Of course there are a\nfew that aren’t, but still, suppose even that ‘savages,’ as you call\nthem, had come and taken the children off—”\n\nLestrange’s breath caught, for this was the very fear that was in his\nheart, though he had never spoken it.\n\n“Well?”\n\n“Well, they would be well treated.”\n\n“And brought up as savages?”\n\n“I suppose so.”\n\nLestrange sighed.\n\n“Look here,” said the captain; “it’s all very well talking, but upon my\nword I think that we civilised folk put on a lot of airs, and waste a\nlot of pity on savages.”\n\n“How so?”\n\n“What does a man want to be but happy?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, who is happier than a naked savage in a warm climate? Oh, he’s\nhappy enough, and he’s not always holding a corroboree. He’s a good\ndeal of a gentleman; he has perfect health; he lives the life a man was\nborn to live face to face with Nature. He doesn’t see the sun through\nan office window or the moon through the smoke of factory chimneys;\nhappy and civilised too—but, bless you, where is he? The whites have\ndriven him out; in one or two small islands you may find him still—a\ncrumb or so of him.”\n\n“Suppose,” said Lestrange, “suppose those children had been brought up\nface to face with Nature—”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“Living that free life—”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“Waking up under the stars”—Lestrange was speaking with his eyes\nfixed, as if upon something very far away—“going to sleep as the sun\nsets, feeling the air fresh, like this which blows upon us, all around\nthem. Suppose they were like that, would it not be a cruelty to bring\nthem to what we call civilisation?”\n\n“I think it would,” said Stannistreet.\n\nLestrange said nothing, but continued pacing the deck, his head bowed\nand his hands behind his back.\n\nOne evening at sunset, Stannistreet said:\n\n“We’re two hundred and forty miles from the island, reckoning from\nto-day’s reckoning at noon. We’re going all ten knots even with this\nbreeze; we ought to fetch the place this time to-morrow. Before that if\nit freshens.”\n\n“I am greatly disturbed,” said Lestrange.\n\nHe went below, and the schooner captain shook his head, and, locking\nhis arm round a ratlin, gave his body to the gentle roll of the craft\nas she stole along, skirting the sunset, splendid, and to the nautical\neye full of fine weather.\n\nThe breeze was not quite so fresh next morning, but it had been blowing\nfairly all the night, and the _Raratonga_ had made good way. About eleven\nit began to fail. It became the lightest sailing breeze, just\nsufficient to keep the sails drawing, and the wake rippling and\nswirling behind. Suddenly Stannistreet, who had been standing talking\nto Lestrange, climbed a few feet up the mizzen ratlins, and shaded his\neyes.\n\n“What is it?” asked Lestrange.\n\n“A boat,” he replied. “Hand me that glass you will find in the sling\nthere.”\n\nHe levelled the glass, and looked for a long time without speaking.\n\n“It’s a boat adrift—a small boat, nothing in her. Stay! I see\nsomething white, can’t make it out. Hi there!”—to the fellow at the\nwheel “Keep her a point more to starboard.” He got on to the deck.\n“We’re going dead on for her.”\n\n“Is there any one in her?” asked Lestrange.\n\n“Can’t quite make out, but I’ll lower the whale-boat and fetch her\nalongside.”\n\nHe gave orders for the whale-boat to be slung out and manned.\n\nAs they approached nearer, it was evident that the drifting boat, which\nlooked like a ship’s dinghy, contained something, but what, could not\nbe made out.\n\nWhen he had approached near enough, Stannistreet put the helm down and\nbrought the schooner to, with her sails all shivering. He took his\nplace in the bow of the whale-boat and Lestrange in the stern. The boat\nwas lowered, the falls cast off, and the oars bent to the water.\n\nThe little dinghy made a mournful picture as she floated, looking\nscarcely bigger than a walnut shell. In thirty strokes the whale-boat’s\nnose was touching her quarter. Stannistreet grasped her gunwale.\n\nIn the bottom of the dinghy lay a girl, naked all but for a strip of\ncoloured striped material. One of her arms was clasped round the neck\nof a form that was half hidden by her body, the other clasped partly to\nherself, partly to her companion, the body of a baby. They were\nnatives, evidently, wrecked or lost by some mischance from some\ninter-island schooner. Their breasts rose and fell gently, and clasped\nin the girl’s hand was a branch of some tree, and on the branch a\nsingle withered berry.\n\n“Are they dead?” asked Lestrange, who divined that there were people in\nthe boat, and who was standing up in the stern of the whale-boat trying\nto see.\n\n“No,” said Stannistreet; “they are asleep.”\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n----- Transcriber's Note #1 -----\n\nIntroduction to the Project Gutenberg text of H. de Vere Stacpoole’s\nThe Blue Lagoon: A Romance\n\nby Edward A. Malone\n\nUniversity of Missouri-Rolla\n\n\nBorn on April 9, 1863, in Kingstown, Ireland, Henry de Vere Stacpoole\ngrew up in a household dominated by his mother and three older sisters.\nWilliam C. Stacpoole, a doctor of divinity from Trinity College and\nheadmaster of Kingstown school, died some time before his son’s eighth\nbirthday, leaving the responsibility of supporting the family to his\nCanadian-born wife, Charlotte Augusta Mountjoy Stacpoole. At a young\nage, Charlotte had been led out of the Canadian backwoods by her\nwidowed mother and taken to Ireland, where their relatives lived. This\nexperience had strengthened her character and prepared her for single\nparenthood.\n\nCharlotte cared passionately for her children and was perhaps overly\nprotective of her son. As a child, Henry suffered from severe\nrespiratory problems, misdiagnosed as chronic bronchitis by his\nphysician, who in the winter of 1871 advised that the boy be taken to\nSouthern France for his health. With her entire family in tow,\nCharlotte made the long journey from Kingstown to London to Paris,\nwhere signs of the Franco-Prussian War were still evident, settling at\nlast in Nice at the Hotel des Iles Britannique. Nice was like paradise\nto Henry, who marveled at the city’s affluence and beauty as he played\nin the warm sun.\n\nAfter several more excursions to the continent, Stacpoole was sent to\nPortarlington, a bleak boarding school more than 100 miles from\nKingstown. In contrast to his sisters, the Portarlington boys were\nnoisy and uncouth. As Stacpoole writes in his autobiograhy Men and\nMice, 1863-1942 (1942), the boys abused him mentally and physically,\nmaking him feel like “a little Arthur in a cage of baboons.” One night,\nhe escaped through an adjacent girls’ school and returned to Kingstown,\nonly to be betrayed by his family and dragged back to school by his\neldest sister.\n\nWhen his family moved to London, he was taken out of Portarlington and\nenrolled at Malvern College, a progressive school with refined students\nand plenty of air and sunshine. Stacpoole thoroughly enjoyed his new\nsurroundings, which he associated with the description of Malvern Hills\nin Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s Aurora Leigh (1857): “Keepers of Piers\nPlowman’s visions / Through the sunshine and the snow.” This\nenvironment encouraged his interest in literature and writing.\n\nThe idyll ended, however, when Stacpoole began his medical training. At\nhis mother’s prodding, he entered the medical school at St. George’s\nHospital. Twice a day, he had to traverse a park frequented by\nperambulating nursemaids, and he became romantically involved with one\nof them. When his mother discovered their affair, she insisted that he\ntransfer to University College, and he complied.\n\nMore interested in literature than corpses, Stacpoole began to neglect\nhis studies and miss classes, especially the required dissections.\nFinally, the dean of the medical school confronted him, and their\nargument drove Stacpoole to St. Mary’s Hospital, where he completed his\nmedical training and qualified L. S. A. in 1891. At some point after\nthis date, Stacpoole made several sea voyages into the tropics (at\nleast once as a doctor aboard a cable-mending ship), collecting\ninformation for future stories.\n\nStacpoole’s literary career, which he once described as being “more\nlike a Malay fishing prahu than an honest-to-God English literary\nvessel,” began inauspiciously with the publication of The Intended\n(1894), a tragic novel about two look-alikes, one rich, the other poor,\nwho switch places on a whim. Bewildered by the novel’s lack of success,\nStacpoole consulted his friendly muse, Pearl Craigie, alias John Oliver\nHobbes, who suggested a comic rather than tragic treatment. Years\nlater, Stacpoole retold the story in The Man Who Lost Himself (1918), a\ncommercially successful comic novel about a down-and-out American who\nimpersonates his wealthy look-alike in England.\n\nSet in France during the Franco-Prussian War, Stacpoole’s second novel,\nPierrot (1896), recounts a French boy’s eerie relationship with a\npatricidal doppelganger. Like its predecessor, it was a commercial\nfailure, and it was at this point, perhaps, that Stacpoole began to\nview literary success only in terms of sales figures and numbers of\neditions.\n\nA strange tale of reincarnation, cross dressing, and uxoricide,\nStacpoole’s third novel, Death, the Knight, and the Lady (1897),\npurports to be the deathbed confession of Beatrice Sinclair, who is\nboth a reincarnated murderer (male) and a descendant of the murder\nvictim (female). She falls in love with Gerald Wilder, a man disguised\nas a woman, who is both a reincarnated murder victim (female) and the\ndescendant of the murderer (male). Despite its originality, the novel\nwas killed by “Public Indifference” (Stacpoole’s term), which also\nkilled The Rapin (1899), a novel about an art student in Paris.\n\nStacpoole spent the summer of 1898 in Sommerset, where he took over the\nmedical practice of an ailing country doctor. So peaceful were his days\nin this pastoral setting that he had time to write The Doctor (1899), a\nnovel about an old-fashioned physician practicing medicine in rural\nEngland. “It is the best book I have written,” Stacpoole declared more\nthan forty years later. He could also say, in retrospect, that the\nbook’s weak sales were a disguised blessing, “for I hadn’t ballast on\nboard in those days to stand up to the gale of success, which means\nincidentally money.” He would be spared the gale of success for nine\nmore years, during which he published seven books, including a\ncollection of children’s stories and two collaborative novels with his\nfriend William Alexander Bryce.\n\nIn 1907, two events occurred that altered the course of Stacpoole’s\nlife: he wrote The Blue Lagoon and he married Margaret Robson. Unable\nto sleep one night, he found himself thinking about and envying the\ncaveman, who in his primitiveness was able to marvel at such\ncommonplace phenomena as sunsets and thunderstorms. Civilized,\ntechnological man had unveiled these mysteries with his telescopes and\nweather balloons, so that they were no longer “nameless wonders” to be\nfeared and contemplated. As a doctor, Stacpoole had witnessed countless\nbirths and deaths, and these events no longer seemed miraculous to him.\nHe conceived the idea of two children growing up alone on an island and\nexperiencing storms, death, and birth in almost complete ignorance and\ninnocence. The next morning, he started writing The Blue Lagoon. The\nexercise was therapeutic because he was able to experience the wonders\nof life and death vicariously through his characters.\n\nThe Blue Lagoon is the story of two cousins, Dicky and Emmeline\nLestrange, stranded on a remote island with a beautiful lagoon. As\nchildren, they are cared for by Paddy Button, a portly sailor who\ndrinks himself to death after only two and a half years in paradise.\nFrightened and confused by the man’s gruesome corpse, the children flee\nto another part of Palm Tree Island. Over a period of five years, they\ngrow up and eventually fall in love. Sex and birth are as mysterious\nto them as death, but they manage to copulate instinctively and\nconceive a child. The birth is especially remarkable: fifteen-year-old\nEmmeline, alone in the jungle, loses consciousness and awakes to find a\nbaby boy on the ground near her. Naming the boy Hannah (an example of\nStacpoole’s penchant for gender reversals), the Lestranges live in\nfamilial bliss until they are unexpectedly expelled from their tropical\nEden.\n\nThe parallels between The Blue Lagoon and the Biblical story of Adam\nand Eve are obvious and intentional, but Stacpoole was also influenced\nby Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865), which he\ninvokes in a passage describing the castaways’ approach Palm Tree\nIsland:\n\n“One could see the water swirling round the coral piers, for the tide\nwas flooding into the lagoon; it had seized the little dinghy and was\nbearing it along far swifter than the sculls could have driven it.\nSea-gulls screamed about them, the boat rocked and swayed. Dick shouted\nwith excitement, and Emmeline shut her eyes TIGHT.\n\n“Then, as though a door had been swiftly and silently closed, the sound\nof the surf became suddenly less. The boat floated on an even keel; she\nopened her eyes and found herself in Wonderland.”\n\nThis direct reference to Wonderland prepares the reader for the many\nparallels that follow. When their adventures begin, both girls are\nabout the same age, Alice seven and a half, Emmeline exactly eight.\nJust as Alice joins a tea party in Wonderland, Emmeline plays with her\ntiny tea set on the beach after they land. Emmeline’s former pet, like\nthe Cheshire Cat, “had white stripes and a white chest, and rings down\nits tail” and died “showing its teeth.” Whereas Alice looks for a\npoison label on a bottle that says “Drink Me,” Emmeline innocently\ntries to eat “the never-wake-up berries” and receives a stern rebuke\nand a lecture about poison from Paddy Button. “The Poetry of Learning”\nchapter echoes Alice’s dialogue with the caterpillar. Like the wily\ncreature smoking a hookah, Paddy smokes a pipe and shouts “Hurroo!” as\nthe children teach him to write his name in the sand. The children\nlose “all count of time,” just as the Mad Hatter does. Whereas Alice\ngrows nine feet taller, Dick sprouts “two inches taller” and Emmeline\n“twice as plump.” Like the baby in the “Pig and Pepper,” Hannah sneezes\nat the first sight of Dicky. The novel is artfully littered with\nreferences to wonder, curiosity, and strangeness—all evidence of\nStacpoole’s conscious effort to invoke and honor his Victorian\npredecessor.\n\nStacpoole presented The Blue Lagoon to Publisher T. Fisher Unwin in\nSeptember 1907 and went to Cumberland to assist another ailing doctor\nin his practice. Every day from Eden Vue in Langwathby, Stacpoole wrote\nto his fiancee, Margaret Robson (or Maggie, as he called her), and\nwaited anxiously for their wedding day. On December 17, 1907, the\ncouple were married and spent their honeymoon at Stebbing Park, a\nfriend’s country house in Essex, about three miles from the village of\nStebbing. It was there that they stumbled upon Rose Cottage, where\nStacpoole lived for several years before he moved to Cliff Dene on the\nIsle of Wight in the 1920s.\n\nPublished in January 1908, The Blue Lagoon was an immediate success,\nboth with reviewers and the public. “[This] tale of the discovery of\nlove, and innocent mating, is as fresh as the ozone that made them\nstrong,” declared one reviewer. Another claimed that “for once the\ntitle of ‘romance,’ found in so many modern stories, is really\njustified.” The novel was reprinted more than twenty times in the next\ntwelve years and remained popular in other forms for more than eighty\nyears. Norman MacOwen and Charlton Mann adapted the story as a play,\nwhich ran for 263 performances in London from August 28, 1920, to April\n16, 1921. Film versions of the novel were made in 1923, 1949, and 1980.\n\nStacpoole also wrote two successful sequels: The Garden of God (1923)\nand The Gates of Morning (1925). These three books and two others were\ncombined to form The Blue Lagoon Omnibus in 1933. The Garden of God was\nfilmed as Return to the Blue Lagoon in 1992.\n\nThis Gutenberg etext of The Blue Lagoon: A Romance is based on the 1908\nfirst American edition published by J. B. Lippincott Company of\nPhiladelphia.\n\n----- Transcriber's Note #2 -----\n\nThe stated edition for this etext is the 1908 first American edition\npublished by J. B. Lippincott Company of Philadelphia. Stacpoole\ndelivered his original manuscript to publisher T. Fisher Unwin (London)\nin September 1907. The London edition and the Lippincott (this etext)\nedition were both published in 1908. Four changes were made in\ncreating the Lippincott edition:\n\n1. On page 18:\n\n   London edition: he sat with it on his knees staring at\n   the white sunlit main-deck barred with the black shadows\n   of the standing rigging.\n\n   US edition: he sat with it on his knees staring at\n   the white sunlit main-deck barred with the white shadows\n   of the standing rigging.\n\n   Stacpoole originally indicated black shadows of the\n   rigging on the deck.\n\n2. On page 19:\n\n   London edition: It was seven bells—half-past three in the\n   afternoon—and the ship’s bell had just rung out.\n\n   US edition: It was three bells—half-past three in the\n   afternoon—and the ship’s bell had just rung out.\n\n   The London edition is correct: seven bells is 3:30 in\n   the afternoon. Three bells is half-past one.\n\n3. On page 24:\n\n   London edition: The dinghy was rather a larger boat than\n   the ordinary ships’ dinghy, and possessed a small mast\n   and lug-sail.\n\n   US edition: The dinghy was rather a larger boat than\n   the ordinary ships’ dinghy, and possessed a small mast\n   and long sail.\n\n   A lug-sail (modern: lugsail) is an evolved version of\n   the classical square sail that is correct for the boat\n   as described.\n\n4. On page 309:\n\n   London edition: “This is the gentleman, Simon,” ...\n\n   US edition: “This is the gentleman, Silas,” ...\n\nOther than these four changes, both 1908 editions are\nessentially identical."
