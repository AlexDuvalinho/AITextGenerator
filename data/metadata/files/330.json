I hated to see him go, after all we\nhad been through together, and I suppose he saw it in my face, for he\ncame over close and stood looking down at me, and smiling. \"You saved\nus, Minnie,\" he said, \"and I needn't tell you we're grateful; but do\nyou know what I think?\" he asked, pointing his long forefinger at me.\n\"I think you've enjoyed it even when you were suffering most. Red-haired\nwomen are born to intrigue, as the sparks fly upward.\"\n\n\"Enjoyed it!\" I snapped. \"I'm an old woman before my time, Mr. Sam. What\nwith trailing back and forward through the snow to the shelter-house,\nand not getting to bed at all some nights, and my heart going by fits\nand starts, as you may say, and half the time my spinal marrow fairly\nchilled--not to mention putting on my overshoes every morning from force\nof habit and having to take them off again, I'm about all in.\"\n\n\"It's been the making of you, Minnie,\" he said, eying me, with his hands\nin his pockets. \"Look at your cheeks! Look at your disposition! I don't\nbelieve you'd stab anybody in the back now!\"\n\n(Which was a joke, of course; I never stabbed anybody in the back.)\n\nHe sauntered over and dropped a quarter into the slot-machine by the\ndoor, but the thing was frozen up and refused to work. I've seen the\ntime when Mr. Sam would have kicked it, but he merely looked at it and\nthen at me.\n\n\"Turned virtuous, like everything else around the place. Not that I\ndon't approve of virtue, Minnie, but I haven't got used to putting my\nfoot on the brass rail of the bar and ordering a nut sundae. Hook\nthe money out with a hairpin, Minnie, and buy some shredded wheat in\nremembrance of me.\"\n\nHe opened the door and a blast of February wind rattled the\nwindow-frames. Mr. Sam threw out his chest under his sweater and waved\nme another good-by.\n\n\"Well, I'm off, Minnie,\" he said. \"Take care of yourself and don't sit\ntoo tight on the job; learn to rise a bit in the saddle.\"\n\n\"Good-by, Mr. Sam!\" I called, putting down Miss Patty's doily and\nfollowing him to the door; \"good-by; better have something before you\nstart to keep you warm.\"\n\nHe turned at the corner of the path and grinned back at me.\n\n\"All right,\" he called. \"I'll go down to the bar and get a lettuce\nsandwich!\"\n\nThen he was gone, and happy as I was, I knew I would miss him terribly.\nI got a wire hairpin and went over to the slot-machine, but when I had\nfinally dug out the money I could hardly see it for tears.\n\nIt began when the old doctor died. I suppose you have heard of Hope\nSanatorium and the mineral spring that made it famous. Perhaps you\nhave seen the blotter we got out, with a flash-light interior of the\nspring-house on it, and me handing the old doctor a glass of mineral\nwater, and wearing the embroidered linen waist that Miss Patty Jennings\ngave me that winter. The blotters were a great success. Below the\npicture it said, \"Yours for health,\" and in the body of the blotter,\nin red lettering, \"Your system absorbs the health-giving drugs in Hope\nSprings water as this blotter soaks up ink.\"\n\nThe \"Yours for health\" was my idea.\n\nI have been spring-house girl at Hope Springs Sanatorium for fourteen\nyears. My father had the position before me, but he took rheumatism, and\nas the old doctor said, it was bad business policy to spend thousands\nof dollars in advertising that Hope Springs water cured rheumatism, and\nthen have father creaking like a rusty hinge every time he bent over to\nfill a glass with it.\n\nFather gave me one piece of advice the day he turned the spring-house\nover to me.\n\n\"It's a difficult situation, my girl,\" he said. \"Lots of people think\nit's simply a matter of filling a glass with water and handing it over\nthe railing. Why, I tell you a barkeeper's a high-priced man mostly, and\nhis job's a snap to this. I'd like to know how a barkeeper would make\nout if his customers came back only once a year and he had to remember\nwhether they wanted their drinks cold or hot or 'chill off'. And another\nthing: if a chap comes in with a tale of woe, does the barkeeper have\nto ask him what he's doing for it, and listen while he tells how much\nweight he lost in a blanket sweat? No, sir; he pushes him a bottle and\nlets it go at that.\"\n\nFather passed away the following winter. He'd been a little bit\ndelirious, and his last words were: \"Yes, sir; hot, with a pinch of\nsalt, sir?\" Poor father! The spring had been his career, you may\nsay, and I like to think that perhaps even now he is sitting by some\neverlasting spring measuring out water with a golden goblet instead of\nthe old tin dipper. I said that to Mr. Sam once, and he said he felt\nquite sure that I was right, and that where father was the water would\nbe appreciated. He had heard of father.\n\nWell, for the first year or so I nearly went crazy. Then I found things\nwere coming my way. I've got the kind of mind that never forgets a name\nor face and can combine them properly, which isn't common. And when\nfolks came back I could call them at once. It would do your heart good\nto see some politician, coming up to rest his stomach from the free\nbar in the state house at the capital, enter the spring-house where\neverybody is playing cards and drinking water and not caring a rap\nwhether he's the man that cleans the windows or the secretary of the\nnavy. If he's been there before, in sixty seconds I have his name on my\ntongue and a glass of water in his hand, and have asked him about\nthe rheumatism in his right knee and how the children are. And in ten\nminutes he's sitting in a bridge game and trotting to the spring to have\nhis glass refilled during his dummy hand, as if he'd grown up in\nthe place. The old doctor used to say my memory was an asset to the\nsanatorium.\n\nHe depended on me a good bit--the old doctor did--and that winter he was\npretty feeble. (He was only seventy, but he'd got in the habit of making\nit eighty to show that the mineral water kept him young. Finally he got\nto BEING eighty, from thinking it, and he died of senility in the end.)\n\nHe was in the habit of coming to the spring-house every day to get his\nmorning glass of water and read the papers. For a good many years it had\nbeen his custom to sit there, in the winter by the wood fire and in the\nsummer just inside the open door, and to read off the headings aloud\nwhile I cleaned around the spring and polished glasses.\n\n\"I see the president is going fishing, Minnie,\" he'd say, or \"Airbrake\nis up to 133; I wish I'd bought it that time I dreamed about it. It was\nyou who persuaded me not to, Minnie.\"\n\nAnd all that winter, with the papers full of rumors that Miss\nPatty Jennings was going to marry a prince, we'd followed it by the\nspring-house fire, the old doctor and I, getting angry at the Austrian\nemperor for opposing it when we knew how much too good Miss Patty was\nfor any foreigner, and then getting nervous and fussed when we read that\nthe prince's mother was in favor of the match and it might go through.\nMiss Patty and her father came every winter to Hope Springs and I\ncouldn't have been more anxious about it if she had been my own sister.\n\nWell, as I say, it all began the very day the old doctor died. He\nstamped out to the spring-house with the morning paper about nine\no'clock, and the wedding seemed to be all off. The paper said the\nemperor had definitely refused his consent and had sent the prince, who\nwas his cousin, for a Japanese cruise, while the Jennings family was\ngoing to Mexico in their private car. The old doctor was indignant, and\nI remember how he tramped up and down the spring-house, muttering that\nthe girl had had a lucky escape, and what did the emperor expect if\nbeauty and youth and wealth weren't enough. But he calmed down, and soon\nhe was reading that the papers were predicting an early spring, and he\nsaid we'd better begin to increase our sulphur percentage in the water.\n\nI hadn't noticed anything strange in his manner, although we'd all\nnoticed how feeble he was growing, but when he got up to go back to\nthe sanatorium and I reached him his cane, it seemed to me he avoided\nlooking at me. He went to the door and then turned and spoke to me over\nhis shoulder.\n\n\"By the way,\" he remarked, \"Mr. Richard will be along in a day or so,\nMinnie. You'd better break it to Mrs. Wiggins.\"\n\nSince the summer before we'd had to break Mr. Dick's coming to Mrs.\nWiggins the housekeeper, owing to his finding her false front where it\nhad blown out of a window, having been hung up to dry, and his wearing\nit to luncheon as whiskers. Mr. Dick was the old doctor's grandson.\n\n\"Humph!\" I said, and he turned around and looked square at me.\n\n\"He's a good boy at heart, Minnie,\" he said. \"We've had our troubles\nwith him, you and I, but everything has been quiet lately.\"\n\nWhen I didn't say anything he looked discouraged, but he had a fine way\nof keeping on until he gained his point, had the old doctor.\n\n\"It HAS been quiet, hasn't it?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said; \"I have been deaf since the last explosion!\" And\nI went down the steps to the spring. I heard the tap of his cane as he\ncame across the floor, and I knew he was angry.\n\n\"Confound you, Minnie,\" he exclaimed, \"if I could get along without you\nI'd discharge you this minute.\"\n\n\"And if I paid any attention to your discharging me I'd have been gone\na dozen times in the last year,\" I retorted. \"I'm not objecting to Mr.\nDick coming here, am I? Only don't expect me to burst into song about\nit. Shut the door behind you when you go out.\"\n\nBut he didn't go at once. He stood watching me polish glasses and get\nthe card-tables ready, and I knew he still had something on his mind.\n\n\"Minnie,\" he said at last, \"you're a shrewd young woman--maybe more head\nthan heart, but that's well enough. And with your temper under control,\nyou're a CAPABLE young woman.\"\n\n\"What has Mr. Dick been up to now?\" I asked, growing suspicious.\n\n\"Nothing. But I'm an old man, Minnie, a very old man.\"\n\n\"Stuff and nonsense,\" I exclaimed, alarmed. \"You're only seventy. That's\nwhat comes of saying in the advertising that you are eighty--to show\nwhat the springs have done for you. It's enough to make a man die of\nsenility to have ten years tacked to his age.\"\n\n\"And if,\" he went on, \"if anything happens to me, Minnie, I'm counting\non you to do what you can for the old place. You've been here a good\nmany years, Minnie.\"\n\n\"Fourteen years I have been ladling out water at this spring,\" I said,\ntrying to keep my lips from trembling. \"I wouldn't be at home any place\nelse, unless it would be in an aquarium. But don't ask me to stay here\nand help Mr. Dick sell the old place for a summer hotel. For that's what\nhe'll do.\"\n\n\"He won't sell it,\" declared the old doctor grimly. \"All I want is for\nyou to promise to stay.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll stay,\" I said. \"I won't promise to be agreeable, but I'll\nstay. Somebody'll have to look after the spring; I reckon Mr. Dick\nthinks it comes out of the earth just as we sell it, with the whole\npharmacopoeia in it.\"\n\nWell, it made the old doctor happier, and I'm not sorry I promised, but\nI've got a joint on my right foot that throbs when it is going to rain\nor I am going to have bad luck, and it gave a jump then. I might have\nknown there was trouble ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nMISS PATTY ARRIVES\n\nIt was pretty quiet in the spring-house that day after the old doctor\nleft. It had started to snow and only the regulars came out. What with\nthe old doctor talking about dying, and Miss Patty Jennings gone to\nMexico, when I'd been looking forward to her and her cantankerous old\nfather coming to Hope Springs for February, as they mostly did, I was\ndepressed all day. I got to the point where Mr. Moody feeding nickels\ninto the slot-machine with one hand and eating zwieback with the other\nmade me nervous. After a while he went to sleep over it, and when he\nhad slipped a nickel in his mouth and tried to put the zwieback in the\nmachine he muttered something and went up to the house.\n\nI was glad to be alone. I drew a chair in front of the fire and wondered\nwhat I would do if the old doctor died, and what a fool I'd been not to\nbe a school-teacher, which is what I studied for.\n\nI was thinking to myself bitterly that all that my experience in the\nspring fitted me for was to be a mermaid, when I heard something running\ndown the path, and it turned out to be Tillie, the diet cook.\n\nShe slammed the door behind her and threw the Finleyville evening paper\nat me.\n\n\"There!\" she said, \"I've won a cake of toilet soap from Bath-house Mike.\nThe emperor's consented.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" I snapped, and snatched the paper. Tillie was right; the\nemperor HAD! I sat down and read it through, and there was Miss Patty's\npicture in an oval and the prince's in another, with a turned-up\nmustache and his hand on the handle of his sword, and between them both\nwas the Austrian emperor. Tillie came and looked over my shoulder.\n\n\"I'm not keen on the mustache,\" she said, \"but the sword's\nbeautiful--and, oh, Minnie, isn't he aristocratic? Look at his nose!\"\n\nBut I'm not one to make up my mind in a hurry, and I'd heard enough talk\nabout foreign marriages in the years I'd been dipping out mineral water\nto make me a skeptic, so to speak.\n\n\"I'm not so sure,\" I said slowly. \"You can't tell anything by that kind\nof a picture. If he was even standing beside a chair I could get a line\non him. He may be only four feet high.\"\n\n\"Then Miss Jennings wouldn't love him,\" declared Tillie. \"How do you\nreckon he makes his mustache point up like that?\"\n\n\"What's love got to do with it?\" I demanded. \"Don't be a fool, Tillie.\nIt takes more than two people's pictures in a newspaper with a red heart\naround them and an overweight cupid above to make a love-match. Love's a\nword that's used to cover a good many sins and to excuse them all.\"\n\n\"She isn't that kind,\" said Tillie. \"She's--she's as sweet as she's\nbeautiful, and you're as excited as I am, Minnie Waters, and if you're\nnot, what have you got the drinking glass she used last winter put on\nthe top shelf out of reach for?\" She went to the door and slammed it\nopen. \"Thank heaven I'm not a dried-up old maid,\" she called back over\nher shoulder, \"and when you're through hugging that paper you can send\nit up to the house.\"\n\nWell, I sat there and thought it over, Miss Patty, or Miss Patricia,\nbeing, so to speak, a friend of mine. They'd come to the Springs every\nwinter for years. Many a time she'd slipped away from her governess and\ncome down to the spring-house for a chat with me, and we'd make pop-corn\ntogether by my open fire, and talk about love and clothes, and even the\ntariff, Miss Patty being for protection, which was natural, seeing that\nwas the way her father made his money, and I for free trade, especially\nin the winter when my tips fall off considerable.\n\nAnd when she was younger she would sit back from the fire, with the\ncorn-popper on her lap and her cheeks as red as cranberries, and say: \"I\nDON'T know why I tell you all these things, Minnie, but Aunt Honoria's\nfunny, and I can't talk to Dorothy; she's too young, you know. Well, HE\nsaid--\" only every winter it was a different \"he.\"\n\nIn my wash-stand drawer I'd kept all the clippings about her coming out\nand the winter she spent in Washington and was supposed to be engaged to\nthe president's son, and the magazine article that told how Mr. Jennings\nhad got his money by robbing widows and orphans, and showed the little\nframe house where Miss Patty was born--as if she's had anything to do\nwith it. And so now I was cutting out the picture of her and the prince\nand the article underneath which told how many castles she'd have, and I\ndon't mind saying I was sniffling a little bit, for I couldn't get used\nto the idea. And suddenly the door closed softly and there was a rustle\nbehind me. When I turned it was Miss Patty herself. She saw the clipping\nimmediately, and stopped just inside the door.\n\n\"YOU, TOO,\" she said. \"And we've come all this distance to get away from\njust that.\"\n\n\"Well, I shan't talk about it,\" I replied, not holding out my hand, for\nwith her, so to speak, next door to being a princess--but she leaned\nright over and kissed me. I could hardly believe it.\n\n\"Why won't you talk about it?\" she insisted, catching me by the\nshoulders and holding me off. \"Minnie, your eyes are as red as your\nhair!\"\n\n\"I don't approve of it,\" I said. \"You might as well know it now as\nlater, Miss Patty. I don't believe in mixed marriages. I had a cousin\nthat married a Jew, and what with him making the children promise to be\ngood on the Talmud and her trying to raise them with the Bible, the poor\nthings is that mixed up that it's pitiful.\"\n\nShe got a little red at that, but she sat down and took up the clipping.\n\n\"He's much better looking than that, Minnie,\" she said soberly, \"and\nhe's a good Catholic. But if that's the way you feel we'll not talk\nabout it. I've had enough trouble at home as it is.\"\n\n\"I guess from that your father isn't crazy about it,\" I remarked,\ngetting her a glass of spring water. The papers had been full of how Mr.\nJennings had forbidden the prince the house when he had been in America\nthe summer before.\n\n\"Certainly he's crazy about it--almost insane!\" she said, and smiled at\nme in her old way over the top of the glass. Then she put down the glass\nand came over to me. \"Minnie, Minnie,\" she said, \"if you only knew how\nI've wanted to get away from the newspapers and the gossips and come to\nthis smelly little spring-house and talk things over with a red-haired,\nsharp-tongued, mean-dispositioned spring-house girl--!\"\n\nAnd with that I began to blubber, and she came into my arms like a baby.\n\n\"You're all I've got,\" I declared, over and over, \"and you're going to\nlive in a country where they harness women with dogs, and you'll never\nhear an English word from morning to night.\"\n\n\"Stuff!\" She gave me a little shake. \"He speaks as good English as I\ndo. And now we're going to stop talking about him--you're worse than the\nnewspapers.\" She took off her things and going into my closet began to\nrummage for the pop-corn. \"Oh, how glad I am to get away,\" she sang\nout to me. \"We're supposed to have gone to Mexico; even Dorothy doesn't\nknow. Where's the pop-corner or the corn-popper or whatever you call\nit?\"\n\nShe was as happy to have escaped the reporters and the people she knew\nas a child, and she sat down on the floor in front of the fire and began\nto shell the corn into the popper, as if she'd done it only the day\nbefore.\n\n\"I guess you're safe enough here,\" I said. \"It's always slack in\nJanuary--only a few chronics and the Saturday-to-Monday husbands, except\na drummer now and then who drives up from Finleyville. It's too early\nfor drooping society buds, and the chronic livers don't get around until\nlate March, after the banquet season closes. It will be pretty quiet for\na while.\"\n\nAnd at that minute the door was flung open, and Bath-house Mike\nstaggered in.\n\n\"The old doctor!\" he gasped. \"He's dead, Miss Minnie--died just now in\nthe hot room in the bathhouse! One minute he was givin' me the divil for\nsomething or other, and the next--I thought he was asleep.\"\n\nSomething that had been heavy in my breast all afternoon suddenly seemed\nto burst and made me feel faint all over. But I didn't lose my head.\n\n\"Does anybody know yet?\" I asked quickly. He shook his head.\n\n\"Then he didn't die in the bath-house, Mike,\" I said firmly. \"He died\nin his bed, and you know it. If it gets out that he died in the hot room\nI'll have the coroner on you.\"\n\nMiss Patty was standing by the railing of the spring. I got my shawl and\nstarted out after Mike, and she followed.\n\n\"If the guests ever get hold of this they'll stampede. Start any\nexcitement in a sanatorium,\" I said, \"and one and all they'll dip their\nthermometers in hot water and swear they've got fever!\"\n\nAnd we hurried to the house together.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nA WILL\n\nWell, we got the poor old doctor moved back to his room, and had one of\nthe chambermaids find him there, and I wired to Mrs. Van Alstyne, who\nwas Mr. Dicky Carter's sister, and who was on her honeymoon in South\nCarolina. The Van Alstynes came back at once, in very bad tempers, and\nwe had the funeral from the preacher's house in Finleyville so as not to\nharrow up the sanatorium people any more than necessary. Even as it was\na few left, but about twenty of the chronics stayed, and it looked as if\nwe might be able to keep going.\n\nMiss Patty sent to town for a black veil for me, and even went to the\nfuneral. It helped to take my mind off my troubles to think who it was\nthat was holding my hand and comforting me, and when, toward the end\nof the service, she got out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes I was\nalmost overcome, she being, so to speak, in the very shadow of a throne.\n\nAfter it was all over the relatives gathered in the sun parlor of the\nsanatorium to hear the will--Mr. Van Alstyne and his wife and about\ntwenty more who had come up from the city for the funeral and stayed\nover--on the house.\n\nWell, the old doctor left me the buttons for his full dress waistcoat\nand his favorite copy of Gray's Anatomy. I couldn't exactly set up\nhousekeeping with my share of the estate, but when the lawyer read that\npart of the will aloud and a grin went around the room I flounced out of\nmy chair.\n\n\"Maybe you think I'm disappointed,\" I said, looking hard at the family,\nwho weren't making any particular pretense at grief, and at the house\npeople standing around the door. \"Maybe you think it's funny to see an\nunmarried woman get a set of waistcoat buttons and a medical book. Well,\nthat set of buttons was the set he bought in London on his wedding trip,\nand the book's the one he read himself to sleep with every night for\ntwenty years. I'm proud to get them.\"\n\nMr. Van Alstyne touched me on the arm.\n\n\"Everybody knows how loyal you've been, Minnie,\" he assured me. \"Now sit\ndown like a good girl and listen to the rest of the will.\"\n\n\"While I'm up I might as well get something else off my mind,\" I said.\n\"I know what's in that will, but I hadn't anything to do with it, Mr.\nVan Alstyne. He took advantage of my being laid up with influenza last\nspring.\"\n\nThey thought that was funny, but a few minutes later they weren't so\ncheerful. You see the sanatorium was a mighty fine piece of property,\nwith a deer park and golf links. We'd had plenty of offers to sell it\nfor a summer hotel, but we'd both been dead against it. That was one of\nthe reasons for the will.\n\nThe whole estate was left to Dicky Carter, who hadn't been able to come,\nowing to his being laid up with an attack of mumps. The family sat up\nand nodded at one another, or held up its hands, but when they heard\nthere was a condition they breathed easier.\n\nBeginning with one week after the reading of the will--and not a day\nlater--Mr. Dick was to take charge of the sanatorium and to stay there\nfor two months without a day off. If at the end of that time the place\nwas being successfully conducted and could show that it hadn't lost\nmoney, the entire property became his for keeps. If he failed it was to\nbe sold and the money given to charity.\n\nYou would have to know Richard Carter to understand the excitement the\nwill caused. Most of us, I reckon, like the sort of person we've never\ndared to be ourselves. The old doctor had gone to bed at ten o'clock all\nhis life and got up at seven, and so he had a sneaking fondness for the\none particular grandson who often didn't go to bed at all. Twice to\nmy knowledge when he was in his teens did Dicky Carter run away from\nschool, and twice his grandfather kept him for a week hidden in the\nshelter-house on the golf links. Naturally when Mr. Van Alstyne and I\nhad to hide him again, which is further on in the story, he went to the\nold shelter-house like a dog to its kennel, only this time--but that's\nahead, too.\n\nWell, the family went back to town in a buzz of indignation, and I\ncarried my waistcoat buttons and my Anatomy out to the spring-house\nand had a good cry. There was a man named Thoburn who was crazy for the\nproperty as a summer hotel, and every time I shut my eyes I could see\n\"Thoburn House\" over the veranda and children sailing paper boats in the\nmineral spring.\n\nSure enough, the next afternoon Mr. Thoburn drove out from Finleyville\nwith a suit case, and before he'd taken off his overcoat he came out to\nthe spring-house.\n\n\"Hello, Minnie,\" he exclaimed. \"Does the old man's ghost come back to\ndope the spring, or do you do it?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you are talking about, Mr. Thoburn,\" I retorted\nsharply. \"If you don't know that this spring has its origin in--\"\n\n\"In Schmidt's drug store down in Finleyville!\" he finished for me. \"Oh,\nI know all about that spring, Minnie! Don't forget that my father's\ncows used to drink that water and liked it. I leave it to you,\" he said,\nsniffing, \"if a self-respecting cow wouldn't die of thirst before she\ndrank that stuff as it is now.\"\n\nI'd been filling him a glass--it being a matter of habit with me--and he\ntook it to the window and held it to the light.\n\n\"You're getting careless, Minnie,\" he said, squinting at it. \"Some of\nthose drugs ought to be dissolved first in hot water. There's a lump of\nlithia there that has Schmidt's pharmacy label on it.\"\n\n\"Where?\" I demanded, and started for it. He laughed at that, and putting\nthe glass down, he came over and stood smiling at me.\n\n\"As ingenuous as a child,\" he said in his mocking way, \"a nice, little\nred-haired child! Minnie, how old is this young Carter?\"\n\n\"Twenty-three.\"\n\n\"An--er--earnest youth? Willing to buckle down to work and make the old\nplace go? Ready to pat the old ladies on the shoulder and squeeze the\nyoung ones' hands?\"\n\n\"He's young,\" I said, \"but if you're counting on his being a fool--\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" he broke in hastily. \"If he hasn't too much character\nhe'll probably succeed. I hope he isn't a fool. If he isn't, oh, friend\nMinnie, he'll stand the atmosphere of this Garden of Souls for about a\nweek, and then he'll kill some of them and escape. Where is he now?\"\n\n\"He's been sick,\" I said. \"Mumps!\"\n\n\"Mumps! Oh, my aunt!\" he exclaimed, and fell to laughing. He was still\nlaughing when he got to the door.\n\n\"Mumps!\" he repeated, with his hand on the knob. \"Minnie, the old place\nwill be under the hammer in three weeks, and if you know what's good for\nyou, you'll sign in under the new management while there's a vacancy.\nYou've been the whole show here for so long that it will be hard for you\nto line up in the back row of the chorus.\"\n\n\"If I were you,\" I said, looking him straight in the eye, \"I wouldn't\npick out any new carpets yet, Mr. Thoburn. I promised the old doctor I'd\nhelp Mr. Dick, and I will.\"\n\n\"So you're actually going to fight it out,\" he said, grinning. \"Well,\nthe odds are in your favor. You are two to my one.\"\n\n\"I think it's pretty even,\" I retorted. \"We will be hindered, so to\nspeak, by having certain principles of honor and honesty. You have no\nhandicap.\"\n\nHe tried to think of a retort, and not finding one he slammed out of the\nspring-house in a rage.\n\nMr. Van Alstyne and his wife came in that same day, just before dinner,\nand we played three-handed bridge for half an hour. As I've said, they'd\nbeen on their honeymoon, and they were both sulky at having to stay at\nthe Springs. It was particularly hard on Mrs. Van Alstyne, because, with\nseven trunks of trousseau with her, she had to put on black. But she\nused to shut herself up in her room in the evenings and deck out for Mr.\nSam in her best things. We found it out one evening when Mrs. Biggs set\nfire to her bureau cover with her alcohol curling-iron heater, and Mrs.\nSam, who had been going around in a black crepe dress all day, rushed\nout in pink satin with crystal trimming, and slippers with cut-glass\nheels.\n\nAfter the first rubber Mrs. Van Alstyne threw her cards on the floor and\nsaid another day like this would finish her.\n\n\"Surely Dick is able to come now,\" she said, like a peevish child.\n\"Didn't he say the swelling was all gone?\"\n\n\"Do you expect me to pick up those cards?\" Mr. Sam asked angrily,\nlooking at her.\n\nMrs. Sam yawned and looked up at him.\n\n\"Of course I do,\" she answered. \"If it wasn't for you I'd not have\nstayed a moment after the funeral. Isn't it bad enough to have seven\ntrunks full of clothes I've never worn, and to have to put on poky old\nblack, without keeping me here in this old ladies' home?\"\n\nMr. Sam looked at the cards and then at her.\n\n\"I'm not going to pick them up,\" he declared. \"And as to our staying\nhere, don't you realize that if we don't your precious brother will\nnever show up here at all, or stay if he does come? And don't you also\nrealize that this is probably the only chance he'll ever have in the\nworld to become financially independent of us?\"\n\n\"You needn't be brutal,\" she said sharply. \"And it isn't so bad for\nyou here as it is for me. You spend every waking minute admiring Miss\nJennings, while I--there isn't a man in the place who'll talk anything\nbut his joints or his stomach.\"\n\nShe got up and went to the window, and Mr. Sam followed her. Nobody\npays any attention to me in the spring-house; I'm a part of it, like the\nbrass rail around the spring, or the clock.\n\n\"I'm not admiring Miss Jennings,\" he corrected, \"I'm sympathizing, dear.\nShe looks too nice a girl to have been stung by the title bee, that's\nall.\"\n\nShe turned her back to him, but he pretended to tuck the hair at the\nback of her neck up under her comb, and she let him do it. As I stooped\nto gather up the cards he kissed the tip of her ear.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said, \"there's a scream of a play down at Finleyville\nto-night called Sweet Peas. Senator Biggs and the bishop went down last\nnight, and they say it's the worst in twenty years. Put on a black veil\nand let's slip away and see it.\"\n\nI think she agreed to do it, but that night after dinner, Amanda King,\nwho has charge of the news stand, told me the sheriff had closed the\nopera-house and that the leading woman was sick at the hotel.\n\n\"They say she looked funny last night,\" Amanda finished, \"and I guess\nshe's got the mumps.\"\n\nMumps!\n\nMy joint gave a throb at that minute.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nAND A WAY\n\nMr. Sam wasn't taking any chances, for the next day he went to the city\nhimself to bring Mr. Dick up. Everything was quiet that day and the day\nafter, except that on the second day I had a difference of opinion with\nthe house doctor and he left.\n\nThe story of the will had got out, of course, and the guests were\nwaiting to see Mr. Dick come and take charge. I got a good bit of gossip\nfrom Miss Cobb, who had had her hair cut short after a fever and used to\ncome out early in the morning and curl it all over her head, heating the\ncurler on the fire log. I never smell burnt hair that I don't think\nof Miss Cobb trying to do the back of her neck. She was one of our\nregulars, and every winter for ten years she'd read me the letters she\nhad got from an insurance agent who'd run away with a married woman the\nday before the wedding. She kept them in a bundle, tied with lavender\nribbon.\n\nIt was on the third day, I think, that Miss Cobb told me that Miss Patty\nand her father had had a quarrel the day before. She got it from one of\nthe chambermaids. Mr. Jennings was a liver case and not pleasant at any\ntime, but he had been worse than usual. Annie, the chambermaid, told\nMiss Cobb that the trouble was about settlements, and that the more Miss\nPatty tried to tell him it was the European custom the worse he got.\nMiss Patty hadn't come down to breakfast that day, and Mr. Moody and\nSenator Biggs made a wager in the Turkish bath--according to Miss\nCobb--Mr. Moody betting the wedding wouldn't come off at all.\n\n\"Of course,\" Miss Cobb said, wetting her finger and trying the iron to\nsee if it was hot, \"of course, Minnie, they're not married yet, and if\nFather Jennings gets ugly and makes any sort of scandal it's all off. A\nscandal just now would be fatal. These royalties are very touchy about\nother people's reputations.\"\n\nWell, I heard that often enough in the next few days.\n\nMr. Sam hadn't come back by the morning of the sixth day, but he wired\nhis wife the day before that Mr. Dick was on the way. But we met every\ntrain with a sleigh, and he didn't come. I was uneasy, knowing Mr. Dick,\nand Mrs. Sam was worried, too.\n\nBy that time everybody was waiting and watching, and on the early train\non the sixth day came the lawyer, a Mr. Stitt. Mr. Thoburn was going\naround with a sort of greasy smile, and if I could have poisoned him\nsafely I'd have done it.\n\nIt had been snowing hard for a day or so, and at eleven o'clock that day\nI saw Miss Cobb and Mrs. Biggs coming down the path to the spring-house,\nMrs. Biggs with her crocheting-bag hanging to the handle of her\numbrella. I opened the door, but they wouldn't come in.\n\n\"We won't track up your clean floor, Minnie,\" Mrs. Biggs said--she was a\nlittle woman, almost fifty, who'd gone through life convinced she'd only\nlived so long by the care she took of herself--\"but I thought I'd better\ncome and speak to you. Please don't irritate Mr. Biggs to-day. He's been\nreading that article of Upton Sinclair's about fasting, and hasn't had a\nbite to eat since noon yesterday.\"\n\nI noticed then that she looked pale. She was a nervous creature,\nalthough she could drink more spring water than any human being I ever\nsaw, except one man, and he was a German.\n\nWell, I promised to be careful. I've seen them fast before, and when a\nfat man starts to live on his own fat, like a bear, he gets about the\nsame disposition.\n\nMrs. Biggs started back, but Miss Cobb waited a moment at the foot of\nthe steps.\n\n\"Mr. Van Alstyne is back,\" she said, \"but he came alone.\"\n\n\"Alone!\" I repeated, staring at her in a sort of daze.\n\n\"Alone,\" she said solemnly, \"and I heard him ask for Mr. Carter. It\nseems he started for here yesterday.\"\n\nBut I'd had time to get myself in hand, and if I had a chill up my\nspine she never knew it. As she started after Mrs. Biggs I saw Mr. Sam\nhurrying down the path toward the spring-house, and I knew my joint\nhadn't throbbed for nothing.\n\nMr. Sam came in and slammed the door behind him.\n\n\"What's this about Mr. Dick not being here?\" he shouted.\n\n\"Well, he isn't. That's all there is to it, Mr. Van Alstyne,\" I said\ncalmly. I am always calm when other people get excited. For that reason\nsome people think my red hair is a false alarm, but they soon find out.\n\n\"But he MUST be here,\" said Mr. Van Alstyne. \"I put him on the train\nmyself yesterday, and waited until it started to be sure he was off.\"\n\n\"The only way to get Mr. Richard anywhere you want him to go,\" I said\ndryly, \"is to have him nailed in a crate and labeled.\"\n\n\"Damned young scamp!\" said Mr. Van Alstyne, although I have a sign in\nthe spring-house, \"Profanity not allowed.\"\n\n\"EXACTLY what was he doing when you last laid eyes on him?\" I asked.\n\n\"He was on the train--\"\n\n\"Was he alone?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Sitting?\"\n\n\"No, standing. What the deuce, Minnie--\"\n\n\"Waving out the window to you?\"\n\n\"Of course not!\" exclaimed Mr. Van Alstyne testily. \"He was raising the\nwindow for a girl in the next seat.\"\n\n\"Precisely!\" I said. \"Would you know the girl well enough to trace her?\"\n\n\"That's ridiculous, you know,\" he said trying to be polite. \"Out of a\nthousand and one things that may have detained him--\"\n\n\"Only one thing ever detains Mr. Dick, and that always detains him,\" I\nsaid solemnly. \"That's a girl. You're a newcomer in the family, Mr. Van\nAlstyne; you don't remember the time he went down here to the station to\nsee his Aunt Agnes off to the city, and we found him three weeks later\nin Oklahoma trying to marry a widow with five children.\"\n\nMr. Van Alstyne dropped into a chair, and through force of habit I gave\nhim a glass of spring water.\n\n\"This was a pretty girl, too,\" he said dismally.\n\nI sat down on the other side of the fireplace, and it seemed to me that\nfather's crayon enlargement over the mantel shook its head at me.\n\nAfter a minute Mr. Van Alstyne drank the water and got up.\n\n\"I'll have to tell my wife,\" he said. \"Who's running the place, anyhow?\nYou?\"\n\n\"Not--exactly,\" I explained, \"but, of course, when anything comes up\nthey consult me. The housekeeper is a fool, and now that the house\ndoctor's gone--\"\n\n\"Gone! Who's looking after the patients?\"\n\n\"Well, most of them have been here before,\" I explained, \"and I know\ntheir treatment--the kind of baths and all that.\"\n\n\"Oh, YOU know the treatment!\" he said, eying me. \"And why did the house\ndoctor go?\"\n\n\"He ordered Mr. Moody to take his spring water hot. Mr. Moody's spring\nwater has been ordered cold for eleven years, and I refused to change.\nIt was between the doctor and me, Mr. Van Alstyne.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course,\" he said, \"if it was a matter of principle--\" He\nstopped, and then something seemed to strike him. \"I say,\" he said;\n\"about the doctor--that's all right, you know; lots of doctors and all\nthat. But for heaven's sake, Minnie, don't discharge the cook.\"\n\nNow that was queer, for it had been running in my head all morning that\nin the slack season it would be cheaper to get a good woman instead of\nthe chef and let Tillie, the diet cook, make the pastry.\n\nMr. Sam picked up his hat and looked at his watch.\n\n\"Eleven thirty,\" he said, \"and no sign of that puppy yet. I guess it's\nup to the police.\"\n\n\"If there was only something to do,\" I said, with a lump in my throat,\n\"but to have to sit and do nothing while the old place dies it's--it's\nawful, Mr. Van Alstyne.\"\n\n\"We're not dead yet,\" he replied from the door, \"and maybe we'll need\nyou before the day's over. If anybody can sail the old bark to shore,\nyou can do it, Minnie. You've been steering it for years. The old doctor\nwas no navigator, and you and I know it.\"\n\nIt was blowing a blizzard by that time, and Miss Patty was the only one\nwho came out to the spring-house until after three o'clock. She shook\nthe snow off her furs and stood by the fire, looking at me and not\nsaying anything for fully a minute.\n\n\"Well,\" she said finally, \"aren't you ashamed of yourself?\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked, and swallowed hard.\n\n\"To be in all this trouble and not let me know. I've just this minute\nheard about it. Can't we get the police?\"\n\n\"Mr. Van Alstyne is trying,\" I said, \"but I don't hope much. Like as not\nMr. Dick will turn up tomorrow and say his calendar was a day slow.\"\n\nI gave her a glass of water, and I noticed when she took it how pale she\nwas. But she held it up and smiled over it at me.\n\n\"Here's to everything turning out better than we expect!\" she said, and\nmade a face as she drank the water. I thought that she was thinking of\nher own troubles as well as mine, for she put down the glass and stood\nlooking at her engagement ring, a square red ruby in an old-fashioned\nsetting. It was a very large ruby, but I've seen showier rings.\n\n\"There isn't anything wrong, Miss Patty, is there?\" I asked, and she\ndropped her hand and looked at me.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she said. \"That is, nothing much, Minnie. Father is--I think\nhe's rather ridiculous about some things, but I dare say he'll come\naround. I don't mind his fussing with me, but--if it should get in the\npapers, Minnie! A breath of unpleasant notoriety now would be fatal!\"\n\n\"I don't see why,\" I said sharply. \"The royal families of Europe have a\ngood bit of unpleasant notoriety themselves occasionally. I should think\nthey'd fall over themselves to get some good red American blood. Blue\nblood's bad blood; you can ask any doctor.\"\n\nBut she only smiled.\n\n\"You're like father, Minnie,\" she said. \"You'll never understand.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure I want to,\" I snapped, and fell to polishing glasses.\n\nThe storm stopped a little at three and most of the guests waded down\nthrough the snow for bridge and spring water. By that time the afternoon\ntrain was in, and no Mr. Dick. Mr. Sam was keeping the lawyer, Mr.\nStitt, in the billiard room, and by four o'clock they'd had everything\nthat was in the bar and were inventing new combinations of their own.\nAnd Mrs. Sam had gone to bed with a nervous headache.\n\nSenator Biggs brought the mail down to the spring-house at four, but\nthere was nothing for me except a note from Mr. Sam, rather shaky, which\nsaid he'd no word yet and that Mr. Stitt had mixed all the cordials in\nthe bar in a beer glass and had had to go to bed.\n\nAt half past four Mr. Thoburn came out for a minute. He said there was\nonly one other train from town that night and the chances were it would\nbe snowed up at the junction.\n\n\"Better get on the band wagon before the parade's gone past,\" he said in\nan undertone. But I went into my pantry and shut the door with a slam,\nand when I came out he was gone.\n\nI nearly went crazy that afternoon. I put salt in Miss Cobb's glass when\nshe always drank the water plain. Once I put the broom in the fire and\nstarted to sweep the porch with a fire log Luckily they were busy with\ntheir letters and it went unnoticed, the smell of burning straw not\nrising, so to speak, above the sulphur in the spring.\n\nSenator Biggs went from one table to another telling how well he felt\nsince he stopped eating, and trying to coax the other men to starve with\nhim.\n\nIt's funny how a man with a theory about his stomach isn't happy until\nhe has made some other fellow swallow it.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, standing in front of the fire with a glass of water in\nhis hand, \"it's worth while to feel like this. My head's as clear as\na bell. I don't care to eat; I don't want to eat. The 'fast' is the\nsolution.\"\n\n\"Two stages to that solution, Senator,\" said the bishop; \"first,\nresolution; last, dissolution.\"\n\nThen they all began at once. If you have ever heard twenty people airing\ntheir theories on diet you know all about it. One shouts for Horace\nFletcher, and another one swears by the scraped-beef treatment, and\nsomebody else never touches a thing but raw eggs and milk, and pretty\nsoon there is a riot of calories and carbohydrates. It always ends the\nsame way: the man with the loudest voice wins, and the defeated ones\nlimp over to the spring and tell their theories to me. They know I'm\nbeing paid to listen.\n\nOn this particular afternoon the bishop stopped the riot by rising and\nholding up his hand. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, \"let us not be\nrancorous. If each of us has a theory, and that theory works out to his\nsatisfaction, then--why are we all here?\"\n\n\"Merely to tell one another the good news!\" Mr. Jennings said sourly\nfrom his corner.\n\nHonest, it was funny. If some folks were healthy they'd be lonesome.\n\nBut when things had got quiet--except Mr. Moody dropping nickels into\nthe slot-machine--I happened to look over at Miss Patty, and I saw there\nwas something wrong. She had a letter open in her lap not one of the\nblue ones with the black and gold seal that every one in the house knew\ncame from the prince but a white one, and she was staring at it as if\nshe'd seen a ghost.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nWANTED--AN OWNER\n\nI have never reproached Miss Patty, but if she had only given me the\nletter to read or had told me the whole truth instead of a part of it,\nI would have understood, and things would all have been different. It is\nall very well for her to say that I looked worried enough already, and\nthat anyhow it was a family affair. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD.\n\nAll she did was to come up to me as I stood in the spring, with her face\nperfectly white, and ask me if my Dicky Carter was the Richard Carter\nwho stayed at the Grosvenor in town.\n\n\"He doesn't stay anywhere,\" I said, with my feet getting cold, \"but\nthat's where he has apartments. What has he been doing now?\"\n\n\"You're expecting him on the evening train, aren't you?\" she asked.\n\"Don't stare like that: my father's watching.\"\n\n\"He ought to be on the evening train,\" I said. I wasn't going to say I\nexpected him. I didn't.\n\n\"Listen, Minnie,\" she said, \"you'll have to send him away again the\nmoment he comes. He must not go into the house.\"\n\nI stood looking at her, with my mouth open.\n\n\"Not go into the house,\" I repeated, \"with everybody waiting for him for\nthe last six days, and Mr. Stitt here to turn things over to him!\"\n\nShe stood tapping her foot, with her pretty brows knitted.\n\n\"The wretch!\" she cried, \"the hateful creature as if things weren't bad\nenough! I suppose he'll have to come, Minnie, but I must see him before\nhe sees any one else.\"\n\nJust then the bishop brought his glass over to the spring.\n\n\"Hot this time, Minnie,\" he said. \"Do you know, I'm getting the\nmineral-water habit, Patty! I'm afraid plain water will have no\nattraction for me after this.\"\n\nHe put his hand over hers on the rail. They were old friends, the bishop\nand the Jenningses.\n\n\"Well, how goes it to-day with the father?\" he said in a low tone, and\nsmiling.\n\nMiss Patty shrugged her shoulders. \"Worse, if possible.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" he said cheerfully. \"If state of mind is any criterion\nI should think he has had a relapse. A little salt, Minnie.\" Miss Patty\nstood watching him while he tasted it.\n\n\"Bishop,\" she said suddenly, \"will you do something for me?\"\n\n\"I always have, Patty.\" He was very fond of Miss Patty, was the bishop.\n\n\"Then--to-night, not later than eight o'clock, get father to play\ncribbage, will you? And keep him in the card-room until nine.\"\n\n\"Another escapade!\" he said, pretending to be very serious. \"Patty,\nPatty, you'll be the death of me yet. Is thy servant a dog, that he\nshould do this thing?\"\n\n\"Certainly NOT,\" said Miss Patty. \"Just a dear, slightly bald, but still\nvery distinguished slave!\"\n\nThe bishop picked up her left hand and looked at the ring and from that\nto her face.\n\n\"There will be plenty of slaves to kiss this little hand, where you are\ngoing, my child,\" he said. \"Sometimes I wish that some nice red-blooded\nboy here at home--but I dare say it will turn out surprisingly well as\nit is.\"\n\n\"Bishop, Bishop!\" Mrs. Moody called. \"How naughty of you, and with your\nbridge hand waiting to be held!\"\n\nHe carried his glass back to the table, stopping for a moment beside Mr.\nJennings.\n\n\"If Patty becomes any more beautiful,\" he said, \"I shall be in favor of\nhaving her wear a mask. How are we young men to protect ourselves?\"\n\n\"Pretty is as pretty does!\" declared Mr. Jennings from behind his\nnewspaper, and Miss Patty went out with her chin up.\n\nWell, I knew Mr. Dick had been up to some mischief; I had suspected it\nall along. But Miss Patty went to bed, and old Mrs. Hutchins, who's a\nsort of lady's-maid-companion of hers, said she mustn't be disturbed. I\nwas pretty nearly sick myself. And when Mr. Sam came out at five o'clock\nand said he'd been in the long-distance telephone booth for an hour\nand had called everybody who had ever known Mr. Dick, and that he had\ndropped right off the earth, I just about gave up. He had got some\ndetectives, he said, and there was some sort of a story about his having\nkept right on the train to Salem, Ohio, but if he had they'd lost the\ntrail there, and anyhow, with the railroad service tied up by the storm\nthere wasn't much chance of his getting to Finleyville in time.\n\nLuckily Mr. Stitt was in bed with a mustard leaf over his stomach and\nice on his head, and didn't know whether it was night or morning. But\nThoburn was going around with a watch in his hand, and Mr. Sam was for\nkilling him and burying the body in the snow.\n\nAt half past five I just about gave up. I was sitting in front of the\nfire wondering why I'd taken influenza the spring before from getting my\nfeet wet in a shower, when I had been standing in a mineral spring for\nso many years that it's a wonder I'm not web-footed. It was when I had\ninfluenza that the old doctor made the will, you remember. Maybe I was\ncrying, I don't recall.\n\nIt was dark outside, and nothing inside but firelight. Suddenly I seemed\nto feel somebody looking at the back of my neck and I turned around.\nThere was a man standing outside one of the windows, staring in.\n\nMy first thought, of course, was that it was Mr. Dick, but just as the\nface vanished I saw that it wasn't. It was older by three or four years\nthan Mr. Dick's and a bit fuller.\n\nI'm not nervous. I've had to hold my own against chronic grouches too\nlong to have nerves, so I went to the door and looked out. The man\ncame around the corner just then and I could see him plainly in the\nfirelight. He was covered with snow, and he wore a sweater and no\novercoat, but he looked like a gentleman.\n\n\"I beg your pardon for spying,\" he said, \"but the fire looked so snug!\nI've been trying to get to the hotel over there, but in the dark I've\nlost the path.\"\n\n\"That's not a hotel,\" I snapped, for that touched me on the raw. \"That's\nHope Springs Sanatorium, and this is one of the Springs.\"\n\n\"Oh, Hope Springs, internal instead of eternal!\" he said. \"That's\nawfully bad, isn't it? To tell you the truth, I think I'd better come in\nand get some; I'm short on hope just now.\"\n\nI thought that was likely enough, for although his voice was cheerful\nand his eyes smiled, there was a drawn look around his mouth, and he\nhadn't shaved that day. I wish I had had as much experience in learning\nwhat's right with folks as I have had in learning what's wrong with\nthem.\n\n\"You'd better come in and get warm, anyhow,\" I told him, \"only don't\nspring any more gags. I've been 'Hebe' for fourteen years and I've\nserved all the fancy drinks you can name over the brass railing of that\nspring. Nowadays, when a fellow gets smart and asks for a Mamie Taylor,\nI charge him a Mamie Taylor price.\"\n\nHe shut the door behind him and came over to the fire.\n\n\"I'm pretty well frozen,\" he said. \"Don't be astonished if I melt before\nyour eyes; I've been walking for hours.\"\n\nNow that I had a better chance to see him I'd sized up that drawn look\naround his mouth.\n\n\"Missed your luncheon, I suppose,\" I said, poking the fire log. He\ngrinned rather sheepishly.\n\n\"Well, I haven't had any, and I've certainly missed it,\" he said.\n\n\"Fasting's healthy, you know.\"\n\nI thought of Senator Biggs, who carried enough fat to nourish him for\nmonths, and then I looked at my visitor, who hadn't an ounce of extra\nflesh on him.\n\n\"Nothing's healthy that isn't natural,\" I declared. \"If you'd care for\na dish of buttered and salted pop-corn, there's some on the mantel. It's\npretty salty; the idea is to make folks thirsty so they'll enjoy the\nmineral water.\"\n\n\"Think of raising a real thirst only to drown it with spring water!\" he\nsaid. But he got the pop corn and he ate it all. If he hadn't had any\nluncheon he hadn't had much breakfast. The queer part was--he was a\ngentleman; his clothes were the right sort, but he had on patent leather\nshoes in all that snow and an automobile cap.\n\nI put away the glasses while he ate. Pretty soon he looked up and the\ndrawn lines were gone. He wasn't like Mr. Dick, but he was the same\ntype, only taller and heavier built.\n\n\"And so it isn't a hotel,\" he remarked. \"Well, I'm sorry. The\ncaravansary in the village is not to my liking, and I had thought of\nengaging a suite up here. My secretary usually attends to these things,\nbut--don't take away all the glasses, Heb--I beg your pardon--but the\nthirst is coming.\"\n\nHe filled the glass himself and then he came up and stood in front of\nme, with the glass held up in the air.\n\n\"To the best woman I have met in many days,\" he said, not mocking but\nserious. \"I was about to lie down and let the little birds cover me\nwith leaves.\" Then he glanced at the empty dish and smiled. \"To buttered\npop-corn! Long may it wave!\" he said, and emptied the glass.\n\nWell, I found a couple of apples in my pantry and brought them out, and\nafter he ate them he told me what had happened to him. He had been a\nlittle of everything since he left college he was about twenty-five had\ncrossed the Atlantic in a catboat and gone with somebody or other into\nsome part of Africa--they got lost and had to eat each other or lizards,\nor something like that--and then he went to the Philippines, and got\nstuck there and had to sell books to get home. He had a little money,\n\"enough for a grub-stake,\" he said, and all his folks were dead. Then\na college friend of his wrote a rural play called Sweet Peas--\"Great\ntitle, don't you think?\" he asked--and he put up all the money. It would\nhave been a hit, he said, but the kid in the play--the one that unites\nits parents in the last act just before he dies of tuberculosis--the kid\ntook the mumps and looked as if, instead of fading away, he was going to\nblow up. Everybody was so afraid of him that they let him die alone for\nthree nights in the middle of the stage. Then the leading woman took the\nmumps, and the sheriff took everything else.\n\n\"You city folks seem to know so much,\" I said, \"and yet you bring a\ncountry play to the country! Why don't you bring out a play with women\nin low-necked gowns, and champagne suppers, and a scandal or two? They\npacked Pike's Opera-House three years ago with a play called Why Women\nSin.\"\n\nWell, of course, the thing failed, and he lost every dollar he'd put\ninto it, which was all he had, including what he had in his pockets.\n\n\"They seized my trunks,\" he explained, \"and I sold my fur-lined overcoat\nfor eight dollars, which took one of the girls back home. It's hard for\nthe women. A fellow can always get some sort of a job--I was coming up\nhere to see if they needed an extra clerk or a waiter, or chauffeur,\nor anything that meant a roof and something to eat--but I suppose they\ndon't need a jack-of-all-trades.\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered, \"but I'll tell you what I think they're going to need.\nAnd that's an owner!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE CONSPIRACY\n\nI'm not making any excuses. I did it for the best. In any sort of crisis\nthere are always folks who stand around and wring their hands and say,\n\"What shall we do?\" And then if it's a fire and somebody has had enough\nsense to send for the engines, they say: \"Just look at what the water\ndid!\" Although as far as I can see I'm the only one that suffered any\ndamage.\n\nIf Mr. Thoburn had not been there, sitting by to see the old sanatorium\ndie so it could sprout wings and fly as a summer hotel, I'd never have\nthought of it. But I was in despair.\n\nI got up and opened the door, but the Snow came in in a cloud, and the\npath was half a foot deep again. It shows on what little threads big\nthings hang, for when I saw the storm I gave up the idea of bringing Mr.\nSam down to see the young man, and the breath of fresh air in my face\nbrought me to my senses.\n\nBut the angel of providence appeared in the shape of Mike, the bath man,\ncoming down through the snow in a tearing rage. The instant I saw Mike I\nknew it was settled.\n\n\"Am I or am I not to give Mr. Moody a needle shower?\" he shouted, almost\nbeside himself. And I saw he had his overcoat over his bath costume,\nwhich is a Turkish towel.\n\n\"A needle shower followed by a salt rub,\" said I. \"He's been having them\nfor eleven years. What's the matter?\"\n\n\"That fool of a young doctor,\" shouted Mike, \"he told him before he left\nthat if he'd been taking them for eleven years and wasn't any better\nit was time to stop. Ain't business bad enough--only four people in the\nhouse takin' baths regular--without his buttin' in!\"\n\n\"Where's Mr. Moody?\"\n\n\"In the bath. I've locked up his clothes.\"\n\n\"You give him a needle shower and a salt rub,\" I ordered, \"and if he\nmakes a fuss just send for me. And, Mike,\" I said, as he started out,\n\"ask Mr. Van Alstyne to come out here immediately.\"\n\nThat's the way it was all the time. Everybody brought their troubles to\nme, and I guess I thought I was a little tin god on wheels and the place\ncouldn't get along without me. But it did; it does. We all think we'll\nleave a big hole behind us when we go, but it's just like taking your\nthumb out of a bowl of soup. There isn't even a dent.\n\nMr. Van Alstyne came out on the run, and when he saw Mr. Pierce by the\nfire--that was his name, Alan Pierce--he stopped and stared. Then he\nsaid:\n\n\"You infernal young scamp!\" And with that Mr. Pierce jumped up,\nsurprised and pretty mad, and Mr. Van Alstyne saw his mistake.\n\n\"I'm sure I beg your pardon!\" he said. \"The fact is, I was expecting\nsomebody else, and in the firelight--\"\n\n\"You surprised me, that's all,\" said Mr. Pierce. \"Under the\ncircumstances, I'm glad I'm not the other chap.\"\n\n\"You may be,\" assured Mr. Sam grimly. \"You're not unlike him, by the\nway. A little taller and heavier, but--\"\n\nNow it's all very well for Mr. Sam to say I originated the idea and all\nthat, but as truly as I am writing this, as I watched his face I saw the\nsame thought come into it. He looked Mr. Pierce up and down, and then he\nstared into the fire and puckered his mouth to whistle, but he didn't.\nAnd finally he glanced at me, but I was looking into the fire, too.\n\n\"Just come, haven't you?\" he asked. \"How did you get up the hill?\"\n\n\"Walked,\" said Mr. Pierce, smiling. \"It took some digging, too. But\nI didn't come for my health, unless you think three meals a day are\nnecessary for health.\"\n\nMr. Sam turned and stared at him. \"By Jove! you don't mean it!\"\n\n\"I wish I didn't,\" Mr. Pierce replied. \"One of the hardest things\nI've had to remember for the last ten hours was that for two years I\nvoluntarily ate only two meals a day. A man's a fool to do a thing like\nthat! It's reckless.\"\n\nMr. Sam got up and began to walk the floor, his hands in his pockets. He\ntried to get my eye, but still I looked in the fire.\n\n\"All traffic's held up, Minnie,\" he said. \"The eight o'clock train is\nstalled beyond the junction, in a drift. I've wired the conductor, and\nCarter isn't on it.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said I.\n\n\"If we could only get past to-day,\" Mr. Sam went on; \"if Thoburn would\nonly choke to death, or--if there was somebody around who looked like\nDick. I dare say, by to-morrow--\" He looked at Mr. Pierce, who smiled\nand looked at him.\n\n\"And I resemble Dick!\" said Mr. Pierce. \"Well, if he's a moral and\nupright young man--\"\n\n\"He isn't!\" Mr. Sam broke in savagely. And then and there he sat down\nand told Mr. Pierce the trouble we were in, and what sort of cheerful\nidiot Dicky Carter was, and how everybody liked him, but wished he would\ngrow up before the family good name was gone, and that now he had a\nchance to make good and be self-supporting, and he wasn't around, and\nif Mr. Sam ever got his hands on him he'd choke a little sense down his\nthroat.\n\nAnd then Mr. Pierce told about the play and the mumps, and how he was\nstranded. When Mr. Sam asked him outright if he'd take Mr. Dick's place\novernight he agreed at once.\n\n\"I haven't anything to lose,\" he said, \"and anyhow I've been on a diet\nof Sweet Peas so long that a sanatorium is about what I need.\"\n\n\"It's like this,\" explained Mr. Sam, \"Old Stitt is pretty thoroughly\njingled--excuse me, Minnie, but it's the fact. I'll take you to his\nroom, with the lights low, and all you'll need to do is to shake hands\nwith him. He's going on the early train to-morrow. Then you needn't mix\naround much with the guests until to-morrow, and by that time I hope to\nhave Dick within thrashing distance.\"\n\nJust as they'd got it arranged that Mr. Pierce was to put on Mr. Sam's\novercoat and walk down to the village so that he could come up in a\nsleigh, as if he had driven over from Yorkton--he was only to walk\nacross the hall in front of the office, with his collar up, just enough\nto show himself and then go to his room with a chill--just as it was all\narranged, Mr. Sam thought of something.\n\n\"The house people are waiting for Dick,\" he said to me, \"and about forty\nwomen are crocheting in the lobby, so they'll be sure to see him. Won't\nsome of them know it isn't Dick?\"\n\nI thought pretty fast.\n\n\"He hasn't been around much lately,\" I said. \"Nobody would know except\nMrs. Wiggins. She'll never forget him; the last time he was here he put\non her false front like a beard and wore it down to dinner.\"\n\n\"Then it's all off,\" he groaned. \"She's got as many eyes as a potato.\"\n\n\"And about as much sense,\" said I. \"Fiddlesticks! She's not so good we\ncan't replace her, and what's the use of swallowing a camel and then\nsticking at a housekeeper?\"\n\n\"You can't get her out of the house in an hour,\" he objected, but in a\nweak voice.\n\n\"I can!\" I said firmly.\n\n(I did. Inside of an hour she went to the clerk, Mr. Slocum, and handed\nin her resignation. She was a touchy person, but I did NOT say all that\nwas quoted. I did NOT say the kitchen was filthy; I only said it took\naway my appetite to look in at the door. But she left, which is the\npoint.)\n\nWell, I stood in the doorway and watched them disappear in the darkness,\nand I felt better than I had all day. It's great to be able to DO\nsomething, even if that something is wrong. But as I put on my shawl\nand turned out the lights, I suddenly remembered. Miss Patty would be\nwaiting in the lobby for Mr. Dick, and she would not be crocheting!\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nMR. PIERCE ACQUIRES A WIFE\n\nWhoever has charge of the spring-house at Hope Springs takes the news\nstand in the evening. That's an old rule. The news stand includes\ntobacco and a circulating library, and is close to the office, and if I\nmissed any human nature at the spring I got it there. If you can't tell\nall about a man by the way he asks for mineral water and drinks it, by\nthe time you've supplied his literature and his tobacco and heard him\ngrumbling over his bill at the office, you've got a line on him and a\nhook in it.\n\nAfter I ate my supper I relieved Amanda King, who runs the news stand in\nthe daytime, when she isn't laid off with the toothache.\n\nMr. Sam was right. All the women had on their puffs, and they were\nsitting in a half-circle on each side of the door. Mrs. Sam was there,\nlooking frightened and anxious, and standing near the card-room door was\nMiss Patty. She was all in white, with two red spots on her cheeks, and\nI thought if her prince could have seen her then he would pretty nearly\nhave eaten her up. Mr. Thoburn was there, of course, pretending to read\nthe paper, but every now and then he looked at his watch, and once\nhe got up and paced off the lobby, putting down the length in his\nnote-book. I didn't need a mind-reader to tell me he was figuring the\ncost of a new hardwood floor and four new rugs.\n\nMr. Sam came to the news stand, and he was so nervous he could hardly\nlight a cigarette.\n\n\"I've had a message from one of the detectives,\" he said. \"They've\ntraced him to Salem, Ohio, but they lost him there. If we can only hold\non this evening--! Look at that first-night audience!\"\n\n\"Mr. Pierce is due in three minutes,\" I told him. \"I hope you told him\nto kiss his sister.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the sort,\" he objected. \"Why should he kiss her? Mrs. Van\nAlstyne is afraid of the whole thing: she won't stand for that.\"\n\n\"I guess she could endure it,\" I remarked dryly.\n\n\"It's astonishing how much of that sort of thing a woman can bear.\"\n\nHe looked at me and grinned.\n\n\"By gad,\" he said, \"I wouldn't be as sophisticated as you are for a good\ndeal. Isn't that the sleigh?\"\n\nEverybody had heard it. The women sat up and craned forward to look at\nthe door: Mrs. Sam was sitting forward clutching the arms of her chair.\nShe was in white, having laid off her black for that evening, with a red\nrose pinned on her so Mr. Pierce would know her. Miss Patty heard the\nsleigh-bells also, and she turned and came toward the door. Her mouth\nwas set hard, and she was twisting the ruby ring as she always did when\nshe was nervous. And at the same moment Mr. Sam and I both saw it; she\nwas in white, too, and she had a red rose tucked in her belt!\n\nMr. Sam muttered something and rushed at her, but he was too late. Just\nas he got to her the door opened and in came Mr. Pierce, with Mr. Sam's\nfur coat turned up around his ears and Mr. Sam's fur cap drawn well down\non his head. He stood for an instant blinking in the light, and Mrs.\nVan Alstyne got up nervously. He never even saw her. His eyes lighted on\nMiss Patty's face and stayed there. Mr. Sam was there, but what could\nhe do? Mr. Pierce walked over to Miss Patty, took her hand, said, \"Hello\nthere!\" and KISSED HER. It was awful.\n\nMost women will do anything to save a scene, and that helped us, for\nshe never turned a hair. But when Mr. Sam got him by the arm and led him\ntoward the stairs, she turned so that the old cats sitting around\ncould not see her and her face was scarlet. She went over to the wood\nfire--our lobby is a sort of big room with chairs and tables and palms,\nand an open fire in winter--and sat down. I don't think she knew herself\nwhether she was most astonished or angry.\n\nMrs. Biggs gave a nasty little laugh.\n\n\"Your brother didn't see you,\" she said to Mrs. Van Alstyne. \"I dare say\na sister doesn't count much when a future princess is around!\"\n\nMrs. Van Alstyne was still staring up the staircase, but she came to\nherself at that. She had some grit in her, if she did look like a French\ndoll.\n\n\"My brother and Miss Jennings are very old friends,\" she remarked\nquietly. I believe that was what she thought, too. I don't think she had\nseen the other red rose, and what was she to think but that Mr. Pierce\nhad known Miss Jennings somewhere? She was dazed, Mrs. Sam was. But she\ncarried off the situation anyhow, and gave us time to breathe. We needed\nit.\n\n\"If I were his highness,\" said Miss Cobb, spreading the Irish lace\ncollar she was making over her knee and squinting at it, \"I should wish\nmy fiancee to be more er--dignified. Those old Austrian families\nare very haughty. They would not understand our American habit of\nosculation.\"\n\nI was pretty mad at that, for anybody could have seen Miss Patty didn't\nkiss him.\n\n\"If by osculation you mean kissing, Miss Cobb,\" I said, going over\nto her, \"I guess you don't remember the Austrian count who was a head\nwaiter here. If there was anything in the way of osculation that that\nmember of an old Austrian family didn't know, I've got to find it out.\nHe could kiss all around any American I ever saw!\"\n\nI went back to my news stand. I was shaking so my knees would hardly\nhold me. All I could think of was that they had swallowed Mr. Pierce,\nbait and hook, and that for a time we were saved, although in the\nelectric light Mr. Pierce was a good bit less like Dicky Carter than he\nhad seemed to be in the spring-house by the fire.\n\nWell, \"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\"\n\nEverybody went to bed early. Mr. Thoburn came over and bought a cigar on\nhis way up-stairs, and he was as gloomy as he had been cheerful before.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I guess you won't put a dancing floor in the\ndining-room just yet, Mr. Thoburn.\"\n\n\"I'm not in a hurry,\" he snapped. \"It's only January, and I don't want\nthe place until May. I'll get it when I'm ready for it. I had a good\nlook at young Carter, and he's got too square a jaw to run a successful\nneurasthenics' home.\"\n\nI went to the pantry myself at ten o'clock and fixed a tray of supper\nfor Mr. Pierce. He would need all his strength the next day, and a man\ncan't travel far on buttered pop-corn. I found some chicken and got a\nbottle of the old doctor's wine--I had kept the key of his wine-cellar\nsince he died--and carried the tray up to Mr. Pierce's sitting-room. He\nhad the old doctor's suite.\n\nThe door was open an inch or so, and as I was about to knock I heard a\ngirl's voice. It was Miss Patty!\n\n\"How can you deny it?\" she was saying angrily. \"I dare say you will even\ndeny that you ever saw this letter before!\"\n\nThere was a minute's pause while I suppose he looked at the letter.\n\n\"I never did!\" he said solemnly.\n\nThere had been a queer sound all along, but now I made it out. Some one\nelse was in the room, sniveling and crying.\n\n\"My poor lamb!\" it whimpered. And I knew it was Mrs. Hutchins, Miss\nPatty's old nurse.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Miss Patty, \"you also deny that you were in Ohio the day\nbefore yesterday.\"\n\n\"I was in Ohio, but I positively assert--\"\n\n\"I'll send for the police, that's what I'll do!\" Mrs. Hutchins said,\nwith a burst of rage, and her chair creaked. \"How can I ever tell your\nfather?\"\n\n\"You'll do nothing of the sort,\" said Miss Patty. \"Do you want the whole\nstory in the papers? Isn't it awful enough as it is? Mr. Carter, I have\nasked my question twice now and I am waiting for an answer.\"\n\n\"But I don't know the answer!\" he said miserably. \"I--I assure you, I'm\nabsolutely in the dark. I don't know what's in the letter. I--I haven't\nalways done what I should, I dare say, but my conduct in the state\nof Ohio during the last few weeks has been without stain--unless I've\nforgotten--but if it had been anything very heinous, I'd remember, don't\nyou think?\"\n\nSomebody crossed the room, and a paper rustled.\n\n\"Read that!\" said Miss Patty's voice. And then silence for a minute.\n\n\"Good lord!\" exclaimed Mr. Pierce.\n\n\"Do you deny that?\"\n\n\"Absolutely!\" he said firmly. \"I--I have never even heard of the\nReverend Dwight Johnstone--\"\n\nThere was a scream from Mrs. Hutchins, and a creak as she fell into her\nchair again.\n\n\"Your father!\" she said, over and over. \"What can we say to your\nfather?\"\n\n\"And that is all you will say?\" demanded Miss Patty scornfully. \"'You\ndon't know;' 'there's a mistake;' 'you never saw the letter before!' Oh,\nif I were only a man!\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what we'll do,\" Mr. Pierce said, with something like\nhope in his voice. \"We'll send for Mr. Van Alstyne! That's the thing, of\ncourse. I'll send for--er--Jim.\"\n\nMr. Van Alstyne's name is Sam, but nobody noticed.\n\n\"Mr. Van Alstyne!\" repeated Miss Patty in a dazed way.\n\nI guessed it was about time to make a diversion, so I knocked and walked\nin with the tray, and they all glared at me. Mrs. Hutchins was collapsed\nin a chair, holding a wet handkerchief to her eyes, and one side of\nher cap was loose and hanging down. Miss Patty was standing by a table,\nwhite and angry, and Mr. Pierce was about a yard from her, with the\nletter in his hands. But he was looking at her.\n\n\"I've brought your supper, Mr. Carter,\" I began. Then I stopped and\nstared at Miss Patty and Mrs. Hutchins. \"Oh,\" I said.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Mr. Pierce, very uncomfortable. \"Just put it down\nanywhere.\"\n\nI stalked across the room and put it on the table. Then I turned and\nlooked at Mrs. Hutchins.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said, \"but it's one of the rules of this house that\nguests don't come to these rooms. They're strictly private. It isn't MY\nrule, ladies, but if you will step down to the parlor--\"\n\nMrs. Hutchins' face turned purple. She got up in a hurry.\n\n\"I'm here with Miss Jennings on a purely personal matter,\" she said\nfuriously. \"How dare you turn us out?\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Minnie!\" said Miss Patty. \"I'll go when I'm ready.\"\n\n\"Rule of the house,\" I remarked, and going over to the door I stood\nholding it open. There wasn't any such rule, but I had to get them out;\nthey had Mr. Pierce driven into a corner and yelling for help.\n\n\"There is no such rule and you know it, Minnie!\" Miss Patty said\nangrily. \"Come, Nana! We're not learning anything, and there's nothing\nto be done until morning, anyhow. My head's whirling.\"\n\nMrs. Hutchins went out first.\n\n\"The first thing I'D do if I owned this place, I'd get rid of that\nred-haired girl,\" she snapped to Mr. Pierce. \"If you want to know\nwhy there are fewer guests here every year, I'll tell you. SHE'S the\nreason!\" Then she flounced out with her head up.\n\n(That was pure piffle. The real reason, as every thinking person knows,\nis Christian Science. It's cheaper and more handy. And now that it isn't\nheresy to say it, the spring being floored over, I reckon that most\nmineral springs cure by suggestion. Also, of course, if a man's drinking\nfour gallons of lithia water a day, he's so saturated that if he does\nthrow in anything alcoholic or indigestible, it's too busy swimming for\nits life to do any harm.)\n\nMr. Pierce took a quick step toward Miss Patty and looked down at her.\n\n\"About--what happened down-stairs to-night,\" he stammered, with the\nunhappiest face I ever saw on a man, \"I--I've been ready to knock my\nfool head off ever since. It was a mistake--a--\"\n\n\"My letter, please,\" said Miss Patty coolly, looking back at him without\na blink.\n\n\"Please don't look like that!\" he begged. \"I came in suddenly out of the\ndarkness, and you--\"\n\n\"My letter, please!\" she said again, raising her eyebrows.\n\nHe gave up trying then. He held out the letter and she took it and went\nout with her head up and scorn in the very way she trailed her skirt\nover the door-sill. But I'm no fool; it didn't need the way he touched\nthe door-knob where she had been holding it, when he closed the door\nafter her, to tell me what ailed him.\n\nHe was crazy about her from the minute he saw her, and he hadn't a\nchange of linen or a cent to his name. And she, as you might say, on the\nragged edge of royalty, with queens and princes sending her stomachers\nand tiaras until she'd hardly need clothes! Well, a cat may look at a\nking.\n\nHe went over to the fireplace, where I was putting his coffee to keep it\nhot, and looked down at me.\n\n\"I've a suspicion, Minnie,\" he said, \"that, to use a vulgar expression,\nI've bitten off more than I can chew in this little undertaking, and\nthat I'm in imminent danger of choking to death. Do you know anybody, a\nfriend of Miss er--Jennings, named Dorothy?\"\n\n\"She's got a younger sister of that name,\" I said, with a sort of chill\ngoing over me. \"She's in boarding-school now.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, she's not!\" he remarked, picking up the coffee-pot. \"It seems\nthat I met her on the train somewhere or other the day before yesterday,\nand ran off with her and married her!\"\n\nI sat back on the rug speechless.\n\n\"You should have warned me, Minnie,\" he went on, growing more cheerful\nover his chicken and coffee. \"I came up here to-night, the proud\npossessor of a bunch of keys, a patent folding cork-screw and a pocket,\nautomobile road map. Inside two hours I have a sanatorium and a wife.\nAt this rate, Minnie, before morning I may reasonably hope to have a\nfamily.\"\n\nI sat where I was on the floor and stared into the fire. Don't tell me\nthe way of the wicked is hard; the wicked get all the fun there is\nout of life, and as far as I can see, it's the respectable \"in at ten\no'clock and up at seven\" part of the wicked's family that has all the\ntrouble and does the worrying.\n\n\"If we could only keep it hidden for a few days!\" I said. \"But, of\ncourse, the papers will get it, and just now, with columns every day\nabout Miss Patty's clothes--\"\n\n\"Her what?\"\n\n\"And all the princes of the blood sending presents, and the king not\nfavoring it very much--\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"About Miss Jennings' wedding. Don't you read the newspaper?\"\n\nHe hadn't really known who she was up to that minute. He put down the\ntray and got up.\n\n\"I--I hadn't connected her with the--the newspaper Miss Jennings,\"\nhe said, and lighted a cigarette over the lamp. Something in his face\nstartled me, I must say.\n\n\"You're not going to give up now?\" I asked. I got up and put my hand on\nhis arm, and I think he was shaking. \"If you do, I'll--I'll go out and\ndrown myself, head down, in the spring.\"\n\nHe had been going to run away--I saw it then--but he put a hand over\nmine. Then he looked at the door where Miss Patty had gone out and gave\nhimself a shake.\n\n\"I'll stay,\" he said. \"We'll fight it out on this line if it takes all\nsummer, Minnie.\" He stood looking into the fire, and although I'm not\nfond of men, knowing, as I have explained, a great deal about their\nstomachs and livers and very little about their hearts, there was\nsomething about Mr. Pierce that made me want to go up and pat him on the\nhead like a little boy. \"After all,\" he said, \"what's blue blood to good\nred blood?\"\n\nWhich was almost what the bishop had said!\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nAND MR. MOODY INDIGESTION\n\nMr. Moody took indigestion that night--not but that he always had it,\nbut this was worse--and Mrs. Moody came to my room about two o'clock and\nknocked at the door.\n\n\"You'd better come,\" she said. \"There's no doctor, and he's awful bad.\nBlames you, too; he says you made him take a salt rub.\"\n\n\"My land,\" I snapped, trying to find my bedroom slippers, \"I didn't make\nhim take clam chowder for supper, and that's what's the matter with him.\nHe's going on a strained rice diet, that's what he's going to do. I've\ngot to have my sleep.\"\n\nShe was waiting in the hall in her kimono, and holding a candle. Anybody\ncould see she'd been crying. As she often said to me, of course she was\ngrateful that Mr. Moody didn't drink--no one knew his virtues better\nthan she did. But her sister married a man who went on a terrible bat\ntwice a year, and all the rest of the time he was humble and affable\ntrying to make up for it. And sometimes she thought if Mr. Moody would\nonly take a little whisky when he had these attacks--! I'd rather be\nthe wife of a cheerful drunkard any time than have to live with a\ncantankerous saint. Miss Cobb and I had had many a fight over it, but at\nthat time there wasn't much likelihood of either of us being called on\nto choose.\n\nWell, we went down to Mr. Moody's room, and he was sitting up in bed\nwith his knees drawn up to his chin and a hot-water bottle held to him.\n\n\"Look at your work, woman,\" he said to me when I opened the door.\n\n\"I'm dying!\"\n\n\"You look sick,\" I said, going over to the bed. It never does to cross\nthem when they get to the water-bottle stage. \"The pharmacy clerk's gone\nto a dance over at Trimble's, but I guess I can find you some whisky.\"\n\n\"Do have some whisky, George,\" begged Mrs. Moody, remembering her\nbrother-in-law.\n\n\"I never touch the stuff and you both know it,\" he snarled. He had a\nfresh pain just then and stopped, clutching up the bottle. \"Besides,\" he\nfinished, when it was over, \"I haven't got any whisky.\"\n\nWell, to make a long story short, we got him to agree to some whisky\nfrom the pharmacy, with a drop of peppermint in it, if he could wash it\ndown with spring water so it wouldn't do him any harm.\n\n\"There isn't any spring water in the house,\" I said, losing my temper a\nlittle, \"and I'm not going out there in my bedroom slippers, Mr.\nMoody. I don't see why your eating what you shouldn't needs to give me\npneumonia.\"\n\nMrs. Moody was standing beside the bed, and I saw her double chin\nbegin to work. If you have ever seen a fat woman, in a short red kimono\nholding a candle by, a bed, and crying, you know how helpless she looks.\n\n\"Don't go, Minnie,\" she sniffled. \"It would be too awful. If you are\nafraid you could take the poker.\"\n\n\"I'm not going!\" I declared firmly. \"It's--it's dratted idiocy, that's\nall. Plain water would do well enough. There's a lot of people think\nwhisky is poison with water, anyhow. Where's the pitcher?\"\n\nOh, yes, I went. I put on some stockings of Mrs. Moody's and a petticoat\nand a shawl and started. It was when I was in the pharmacy looking for\nthe peppermint that I first noticed my joint again. A joint like that's\na blessing or a curse, the way you look at it.\n\nI found the peppermint and some whisky and put them on the stairs. Then\nI took my pitcher and lantern and started for the spring-house. It was\nstill snowing, and part of the time Mrs. Moody's stockings were up to\ntheir knees. The wind was blowing hard, and when I rounded the corner\nof the house my lantern went out. I stood there in the storm, with the\nshawl flapping, thanking heaven I was a single woman, and about ready\nto go back and tell Mr. Moody what I thought of him when I looked toward\nthe spring-house.\n\nAt first I thought it was afire, then I saw that the light was coming\nfrom the windows. Somebody was inside, with a big fire and all the\nlights going.\n\nI'd had tramps sleep all night in the spring-house before, and once they\nleft a card by the spring: \"Water, water everywhere and not a drop to\ndrink!\" So I started out through the snow on a half run. By the bridge\nover Hope Springs Creek I slipped and fell, and I heard the pitcher\nsmash to bits on the ice below. But as soon as I could move I went on\nagain. That spring-house had been my home for a good many years, and the\ntramp didn't live who could spend the night there if I knew it.\n\nI realized then that I should have taken the poker. I went over\ncautiously to one of the windows, wading in deep snow to get there--and\nif you have ever done that in a pair of bedroom slippers you can realize\nthe state of my mind--and looked in.\n\nThere were three chairs drawn up in a row in front of the fire, with\nmy bearskin hearth-rug on them to make a couch, and my shepherd's plaid\nshawl folded at one end for a pillow. And stretched on that with her\nlong sealskin coat laid over her was Dorothy Jennings, Miss Patty's\nyounger sister! She was alone, as far as I could see, and she was\nleaning on her elbow with her cheek in her hand, staring at the fire.\nJust then the door into the pantry opened and out came Mr. Dick himself.\n\n\"Were you calling, honey?\" he said, coming over and looking down at her.\n\n\"You were such a long time!\" says she, glancing up under her lashes at\nhim. \"I--I was lonely!\"\n\n\"Bless you,\" says Mr. Dick, stooping over her. \"What did I ever do\nwithout you?\"\n\nI could have told her a few things he did, but by that time it was\ncoming over me pretty strong that here was the real Dicky Carter and\nthat I had an extra one on my hands. The minute I looked at this one I\nknew that nobody but a blind man would mistake one for the other, and\nMr. Thoburn wasn't blind. I tell you I stood out in that snow-bank and\nperspired!\n\nWhen I looked again Mr. Dick was on his knees by the row of chairs, and\nMiss Dorothy--Mrs. Dicky, of course--was running her fingers through his\nhair.\n\n\"Minnie used to keep apples and things in the pantry,\" he said, \"but she\nmust be growing stingy in her old age; there's not a bite there.\"\n\n\"I'm not so very hungry when I have you!\" cooed Mrs. Dicky.\n\n\"But you can't eat me.\" He brought her hand down from his hair--I may be\nstingy in my old age, but I've learned a few things, and one is that a\nman feels like a fool with his hair rumpled, and I can tell the degree\nof a woman's experience by the way she lets his top hair alone--and\npretended to bite it, her hand, of course. \"Although I could eat you,\"\nhe said. \"I'd like to take a bite out of your throat right there.\"\n\nWell, it was no place for me unless they knew I was around. I waded\naround to the door and walked in, and there was a grand upsetting of the\nsealskin coat and my shepherd's plaid shawl. Mr. Dick jumped to his feet\nand Mrs. Dick sat bolt upright and stared at me over the backs of the\nchairs.\n\n\"Minnie!\" cried Mr. Dick. \"As I'm a married man, it's Minnie herself;\nMinnie, the guardian angel! The spirit of the place! Dorothy, don't you\nremember Minnie?\"\n\nShe came toward me with her hand out. She was a pretty little thing, not\nso beautiful as Miss Patty, but with a nice way about her.\n\n\"I'm awfully glad to see you again,\" she said. \"Of course I\nremember--why you are hardly dressed at all! You must be frozen!\"\n\nI went over to the fire and emptied my bedroom slippers of snow. Then I\nsat down and looked at them both.\n\n\"Frozen!\" repeated I; \"I'm in a hot sweat. If you two children meant to\ncome, why in creation didn't you come in time?\"\n\n\"We did,\" replied Mr. Dick, promptly. \"We crawled under the wire fence\ninto the deer park at five minutes to twelve. The will said 'Be on the\nground,' and I was--flat on the ground!\"\n\n\"We've had the police,\" I said, drearily enough. \"I wouldn't live\nthrough another day like yesterday for a hundred dollars.\"\n\n\"We were held up by the snow,\" he explained. \"We got a sleigh to come\nover in, but we walked up the hill and came here. I don't mind saying\nthat my wife's people don't know about this yet, and we're going to lay\nlow until we've cooked up some sort of a scheme to tell them.\" Then he\ncame over and put his hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"Poor old Minnie!\" he said; \"honest, I'm sorry. I've been a hard child\nto raise, haven't I? But that's all over, Minnie. I've got an incentive\nnow, and it's 'steady, old boy,' for me from now. You and I will run the\nplace and run it right.\"\n\n\"I don't want to!\" I retorted, holding my bedroom slippers to steam\nbefore the fire. \"I'm going to buy out Timmon's candy store and live a\nquiet life, Mr. Dick. This place is making me old.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! We're going to work together, and we'll make this the busiest\nspot in seven counties. Dorothy and I have got it all planned out and\nwe've got some corking good ideas.\" He put his hands in his pockets and\nstrutted up and down. \"It's the day of advertising, you know, Minnie,\"\nhe said. \"You've got to have the goods, and then you've got to\nlet people know you've got the goods. What would you say to a\nshooting-gallery in the basement, under the reading-room?\"\n\n\"Fine!\" I said, with sarcasm, turning my slippers. \"If things got\ntoo quiet that would wake them up a bit, and we could have a balloon\nascension on Saturdays!\"\n\n\"Not an ascension,\" said he, with my bitterness going right over his\nhead. \"Nothing sensational, Minnie. That's the way with women; they're\nalways theatrical. But what's the matter with a captive balloon, and\nletting fresh-air cranks sleep in a big basket bed--say, at five hundred\nfeet? Or a thousand--a thousand would be better. The air's purer.\"\n\n\"With a net below,\" says I, \"in case they should turn over and fall out\nof bed! It's funny nobody ever thought of it before!\"\n\n\"Isn't it?\" exclaimed Mrs. Dick. \"And we've all sorts of ideas.\nDick--Mr. Carter has learned of a brand new cocktail for the men--\"\n\n\"A lulu!\" he broke in.\n\n\"And I'm going around to read to the old ladies and hold their hands--\"\n\n\"You'll have to chloroform them first,\" I put in. \"Perhaps it would be\nbetter to give the women the cocktail and hold the men's hands.\"\n\n\"Oh, if you're going to be funny!\" Mr. Dick said savagely, \"we'll not\ntell you any more. I've been counting on you, Minnie. You've been here\nso long. You know,\" he said to his wife, \"when I was a little shaver I\nthought Minnie had webbed-feet--she was always on the bank, like a duck.\nYou ARE a duck, Minnie,\" he says to me; \"a nice red-headed duck! Now\ndon't be quirky and spoil everything.\"\n\nI couldn't be light-hearted to save my life.\n\n\"Your sister's been wild all day,\" I told Mrs. Dick. \"She got your\nletter to-day--yesterday--but I don't think she's told your father yet.\"\n\n\"What!\" she screeched, and caught at the mantelpiece to hold herself.\n\"Not Pat!\" she said, horrified, \"and father! Here!\"\n\nWell, I listened while they told me. They hadn't had the faintest idea\nthat Mr. Jennings and Miss Patty were there at the sanatorium. The girl\nhad been making a round of visits in the Christmas holidays, and instead\nof going back to school she'd sent a forged excuse and got a month\noff--she hadn't had any letters, of course. The plan had been not\nto tell anybody but her sister until Mr. Dick had made good at the\nsanatorium.\n\n\"The idea was this, Minnie,\" said Mr. Dick. \"Old--I mean Mr. Jennings\nis--is not well; he has a chronic indisposition--\"\n\n\"Disposition, I call it,\" put in Mr. Jennings' daughter.\n\n\"And he's apt to regard my running away with Dorothy when I haven't a\npenny as more of an embezzlement than an elopement.\"\n\n\"Fiddle!\" exclaimed Mrs. Dick. \"I asked you to marry me, and now they're\nhere and have to spoil it all.\"\n\nThe thought of her father and his disposition suddenly overpowered her\nand she put her yellow head on the back of a chair and began to cry.\n\n\"I--I can't tell him!\" she sobbed. \"I wrote to Pat,--why doesn't Pat\ntell him? I'm going back to school.\"\n\n\"You'll do nothing of the sort. You're a married woman now, and where\nI go you go. My country is your country, and my sanatorium is your\nsanatorium.\" He was in a great rage.\n\nBut she got up and began trying to pull on her fur coat, and her jaw was\nset. She looked like her father for a minute.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" he asked, looking scared.\n\n\"Anywhere. I'll go down to the station and take the first train, it\ndoesn't matter where to.\" She picked up her muff, but he went over and\nstood against the door.\n\n\"Not a step without me!\" he declared. \"I'll go with you, of course; you\nknow that. I'm not afraid of your father: I'd as soon as not go in and\nwake him now and tell him the whole thing--that you've married a chap\nwho isn't worth the butter on his bread, who can't buy you kid gloves--\"\n\n\"But you will, as soon as the sanatorium succeeds!\" she put in bravely.\nShe put down her muff. \"Don't tell him to-night, anyhow. Maybe Pat will\nthink of some way to break it to him. She can do a lot with father.\"\n\n\"I hope she can think of some way to break another Richard Carter to the\npeople in the house,\" I said tartly.\n\n\"Another Richard Carter!\" they said together, and then I told them about\nhow we had waited and got desperate, and how we'd brought in Mr. Pierce\nat the last minute and that he was asleep now at the house. They roared.\nTo save my life I couldn't see that it was funny. But when I came to the\npart about Thoburn being there, and his having had a good look at Mr.\nPierce, and that he was waiting around with his jaws open to snap up\nthe place when it fell under the hammer, Mr. Dick stopped laughing and\nlooked serious.\n\n\"Lord deliver us from our friends!\" he said. \"Between you and Sam,\nyou've got things in a lovely mess, Minnie. What are you going to do\nabout it now?\"\n\n\"It's possible we can get by Thoburn,\" I said. \"You can slip in\nto-night, we can get Mr. Pierce out--Lord knows he'll be glad to go--and\nMiss Dorothy can go back to school. Then, later, when you've got things\nrunning and are making good--\"\n\n\"I'm not going back to school,\" she declared, \"but I'll go away; I'll\nnot stand in your way, Dicky.\" She took two steps toward the door and\nwaited for him to stop her.\n\n\"Nonsense, Minnie,\" he exclaimed angrily and put his arm around her, \"I\nwon't be separated from my wife. You got me into this scrape, and--\"\n\n\"I didn't marry you!\" I retorted. \"And I'm not responsible for your\nfather-in-law's disposition.\"\n\n\"You'll have to help us out,\" he finished.\n\n\"What shall I do? Murder Mr. Jennings?\" I asked bitterly. \"If you expect\nme to suggest that you both go to the house, and your wife can hide in\nyour rooms--\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Mr. Dick.\n\nWell, I sat down again and explained patiently that it would get out\namong the servants and cause a scandal, and that even if it didn't I\nwasn't going to have any more deception: I had enough already. And after\na while they saw it as I did, and agreed to wait and see Miss Patty\nbefore they decided. They wanted to have her wakened at once, but I\nrefused, although I agreed to bring her out first thing in the morning.\n\n\"But you can't stay here,\" I said. \"There'll be Miss Cobb at nine\no'clock, and the man comes to light the fire at eight.\"\n\n\"We could go to the old shelter-house on the golf links,\" suggested Mr.\nDick, looking me square in the eye. (I took the hint, and Mrs. Dicky\nnever knew he had been hidden there before.)\n\n\"Nobody ever goes near it in winter.\" So I put on my slippers again and\nwe started through the snow across the golf links, Mr. Dick carrying a\nbundle of firewood, and I leading the way with my lantern. Twice I went\ninto a drift to my waist, and once a rabbit bunted into me head on, and\nwould have scared me into a chill if I hadn't been shaking already. The\ntwo behind me were cheerful enough. Mr. Dick pointed out the general\ndirection of the deer park which hides the shelter-house from the\nsanatorium, and if you'll believe it, with snow so thick I had to scrape\nit off the lantern every minute or so, those children planned to give\nsomething called A Midsummer Night's Dream in the deer park among the\ntrees in the spring, to entertain the patients.\n\n\"I wish to heaven I'd wake up and find all THIS a dream,\" I called back\nover my shoulder. But they were busy with costumes and getting some\nfolks they knew from town to take the different parts and they never\neven heard me. The last few yards they snowballed each other and me. I\ntell you I felt a hundred years old.\n\nWe got into the shelter-house by my crawling through a window, and when\nwe had lighted the fire and hung up the lantern, it didn't seem so\nbad. The place had been closed since summer, and it seemed colder than\noutside, but those two did the barn dance then and there. There were two\nrooms, and Mr. Dick had always used the back one to hide in. It's a good\nthing Mrs. Dick was not a suspicious person. Many a woman would have\nwondered when she saw him lift a board in the floor and take out a\nrusty tin basin, a cake of soap, a moldy towel, a can of sardines, a\ntooth-brush and a rubber carriage robe to lay over the rafters under the\nhole in the roof. But it's been my experience that the first few days\nof married life women are blind because they want to be and after that\nbecause they have to be.\n\nIt was about four when I left them, sitting on a soap box in front of\nthe fire toasting sardines on the end of Mr. Dick's walking-stick. Mrs.\nDick made me put on her sealskin coat, and I took the lantern, leaving\nthem in the firelight. They'd gone back to the captive balloon idea and\nwere wondering if they couldn't get it copyrighted!\n\nI took a short cut home, crawling through the barbed-wire fence and\ngoing through the deer park. I was too tired and cold to think. I\nstumbled down the hill to the house, and just before I got to the corner\nI heard voices, and the shuffling of feet through the snow. The next\ninstant a lantern came around the corner of the house. Mr. Thoburn was\ncarrying it, and behind him were the bishop, Mike the bath man, and Mr.\nPierce.\n\n\"It's like that man Moody,\" the bishop was saying angrily, \"to send the\ngirl--\"\n\n\"Piffle!\" snarled Mr. Thoburn. \"If ever a woman was able to take care\nof herself--\" And then they saw me, and they all stopped and stared.\n\n\"Good gracious, girl!\" said the bishop, with his dressing-gown blowing\nout straight behind him in the wind. \"We thought you'd been buried in a\ndrift!\"\n\n\"I don't see why!\" I retorted defiantly. \"Can't I go out to my own\nspring-house without having a posse after me to bring me back?\"\n\n\"Ordinarily,\" said Mr. Thoburn, with his snaky eyes on me, \"I think\nI may say that you might go almost anywhere without my turning out to\nrecover you. But Mrs. Moody is having hysterics.\"\n\nMrs. Moody! I'd forgotten the Moodys!\n\n\"She is convinced that you have drowned yourself, head down, in the\nspring,\" Mr. Pierce said in his pleasant way. \"You've been gone two\nhours, you know.\"\n\nHe took my arm and turned me toward the house. I was dazed.\n\n\"In answer to your urgent inquiry,\" Mr. Thoburn called after me,\ndisagreeably, \"Mr. Moody has not died. He is asleep. But, by the way,\nwhere's the spring water?\"\n\nI didn't answer him; I couldn't. We went into the house; Mrs. Moody and\nMiss Cobb were sitting on the stairs. Mrs. Moody had been crying, and\nMiss Cobb was feeding her the whisky I had left, with a teaspoon. She\nhad had a half tumblerful already and was quite maudlin. She ran to me\nand put her arms around me.\n\n\"I thought I was a murderess!\" she cried. \"Oh, the thought! Blood on my\nsoul! Why, Minnie Waters, wherever did you get that sealskin coat!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nDOLLY, HOW COULD YOU?\n\nI lay down across my bed at six o'clock that morning, but I was too\ntired and worried to sleep, so at seven I got up and dressed.\n\nI was frightened when I saw myself in the glass. My eyes looked like\nburnt holes in a blanket. I put on two pairs of stockings and heavy\nshoes, for I knew I was going to do the Eskimo act again that day and\ngoodness knows how many days more, and then I went down and knocked\nat the door of Miss Patty's room. She hadn't been sleeping either. She\ncalled to me in an undertone to come in, and she was lying propped up\nwith pillows, with something pink around her shoulders and the night\nlamp burning beside the bed. She had a book in her hand, but all over\nthe covers and on the table at her elbow were letters in the blue\nforeign envelopes with the red and black and gold seal.\n\nI walked over to the foot of the bed.\n\n\"They're here,\" I said.\n\nShe sat up, and some letters slid to the floor.\n\n\"THEY'RE here!\" she repeated. \"Do you mean Dorothy?\"\n\n\"She and her husband. They came last night at five minutes to twelve.\nTheir train was held up by the blizzard and they won't come in until\nthey see you. They're hiding in the shelter-house on the golf links.\"\n\nI think she thought I was crazy: I looked it. She hopped out of bed and\nclosed the door into her sitting-room--Mrs. Hutchins' room opened off\nit--and then she came over and put her hand on my arm.\n\n\"Will you sit down and try to tell me just what you mean?\" she said.\n\"How can my sister and her--her wretch of a husband have come last night\nat midnight when I saw Mr. Carter myself not later than ten o'clock?\"\n\nWell, I had to tell her then about who Mr. Pierce was and why I had\nto get him, and she understood almost at once. She was the most\nunderstanding girl I ever met. She saw at once what Mr. Sam wouldn't\nhave known in a thousand years--that I wanted to save the old place not\nto keep my position--but because I'd been there so long, and my father\nbefore me, and had helped to make it what it was and all that. And\nshe stood there in her nightgown--she who was almost a princess--and\nlistened to me, and patted me on the shoulder when I broke down, telling\nher about Thoburn and the summer hotel.\n\n\"But here I am,\" I finished, \"telling you about my troubles and\nforgetting what I came for. You'll have to go out to the shelter-house,\nMiss Patty. And I guess you're expected to fix it up with your father.\"\n\nShe stopped unfastening her long braids of hair.\n\n\"Certainly I'll go to the shelter-house,\" she said, \"and I'll shake a\nlittle sense into Dorothy Jennings--the abominable little idiot! But\nthey needn't think I'm going to help them with father; I wouldn't if I\ncould, and I can't. He won't speak to me. I'm in disgrace, Minnie.\" She\ngave her hair a shake, twisted it into a rope and then a knot, and\nstuck a pin in it. It was lovely: I wish Miss Cobb could have seen her.\n\"You've known father for years, Minnie: have you ever known him to be\nso--so--\"\n\n\"Devilish\" was the word she meant, but I finished for her.\n\n\"Unreasonable?\" I said. \"Well, once before when you were a little girl,\nhe put his cane through a window in the spring-house, because he thought\nit needed air. The spring-house, of course, not the cane.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" she said, looking around the room, \"and now he's putting a\ncane through every plan I have made. Do you see my heavy boots?\"\n\n\"It's like this,\" I remarked, bringing the boots from outside the door,\n\"if he's swallowed the prince and is choking on the settlement question\nhe might as well get over it. All those foreigners expect pay for taking\na wife. Didn't the chef here want to marry Tillie, the diet cook, and\ndidn't he want her to turn over the three hundred dollars she had in the\nbank, and her real estate, which was a sixth interest in a cemetery lot?\nBut Tillie stuck it out and he wouldn't take her without.\"\n\n\"It isn't quite the same, Minnie,\" she said, sitting down on the floor\nto put on her stockings.\n\n\"The principle's the same,\" I retorted, \"and if you ask me--\"\n\n\"I haven't,\" she said disagreeably, \"and when you begin to argue,\nMinnie, you make my head ache.\"\n\n\"I have had a heartache for a week,\" I snapped, \"let alone heartburn,\nand I'll be glad when the Jennings family is safely married and I can\nsleep at night.\"\n\nI was hurt. I went out and shut the door behind me, but I stopped in the\nhall and went back.\n\n\"I forgot to say,\" I began, and stopped. She was still sitting on the\nfloor, trying to put her heavy boots on, and crying all over them.\n\n\"Stop that instantly,\" I said, and jerked her shoes from her. \"Get into\na chair and let me put them on. And if you will wait a jiffy I'll bring\nyou a cup of coffee. I'm not even a Christian in the morning until I've\nhad my coffee.\"\n\n\"You haven't had it yet, have you?\" she asked, and we laughed together,\nrather shaky. But as I buttoned her shoes I saw her eyes going toward\nthe blue letters on the bed.\n\n\"Oh, Minnie,\" she said, \"if you only knew how peculiar they are in\nEurope! They'll never allow a sanatorium in the family!\"\n\n\"I guess a good many would be the better for having one close,\" I said.\n\nWell, I left her to get dressed and went to the kitchens. Tillie was\nthere getting the beef tea ready for the day, but none of the rest was\naround. They knew the housekeeper was gone, but I guess they'd forgotten\nthat I was still on hand. I put a kettle against the electric bell that\nrings in the chef's room so it would keep on ringing and went on into\nthe diet kitchen.\n\n\"Tillie,\" I said, \"can you trust me?\"\n\nShe looked up from her beef.\n\n\"Whether I can or not, I always have,\" she answered.\n\n\"Well, can I trust you? That's more to the point.\"\n\nShe put down her knife and came over to me, with her hands on her hips.\n\n\"I don't know what you're up to, Minnie,\" she said, \"and I don't know\nthat I care. But if you've forgotten the time I went to the city and\nbrought you sulphur and the Lord only knows what for your old spring\nwhen you'd run short and were laid up with influenza--\"\n\n\"Hush!\" I exclaimed. \"You needn't shout it. Tillie, I don't want you\nto ask me any questions, but I want four raw eggs in a basket, a pot of\ncoffee and cream, some fruit if you can get it when the chef unlocks the\nrefrigerator room, and bread and butter. They can make their own toast.\"\n\n\"They?\" she said, with her mouth open.\n\nBut I didn't explain any more. I had found Tillie about a year before,\nfrying sausages at the railroad station, and made her diet cook at\nthe sanatorium. Mrs. Wiggins hadn't wanted her, but, as I told the old\ndoctor at the time, we needed somebody in the kitchen to keep an eye on\nthings for us. It was through Tillie that we discovered that the help\nwere having egg-nog twice a day, with eggs as scarce as hens' teeth, and\nthe pharmacy clerk putting in a requisition for more whisky every week.\n\nWell, I scribbled a note to Mr. Van Alstyne, telling what had happened,\nand put it under his door, and then I met Miss Patty in the hall by the\nbilliard room and I gave her some coffee from the basket, in the sun\nparlor. It was still dark, although it was nearly eight o'clock, and\nnobody saw us go out together. Just as we left I heard the chef in the\nkitchen bawling out that he'd murder whoever put the kettle against the\nbell, and Tillie saying it must have dropped off the hook and landed\nthere.\n\nWe went to the spring-house first, to avoid suspicion, and then across\nback of the deer park to the shelter-house. It was still snowing, but\nnot so much, and the tracks we had made early in the morning were still\nthere, mine off to one side alone, and the others close together and\nside by side. There was a whole history in those snow tracks, mine alone\nand kind of offish, and the others cuddling together. It made me lonely\nto look at them.\n\nI remember wishing I'd taught school, as I was educated to; woman wasn't\nmade to live alone, and most school-teachers get married.\n\nMiss Patty did not say much. She was holding her chin high and looking\nrather angry and determined. At the spring-house I gave her the basket\nand took an armful of fire-wood myself. I knew Mr. Dick would never\nthink of it until the fire was out.\n\nThey were both asleep in the shelter-house. He was propped up against\nthe wall on a box, with the rubber carriage robe around him, and she was\nlying by the fire, with Mrs. Moody's shawl over her and her muff under\nher head. Miss Patty stood in the doorway for an instant. Then she\nwalked over and, leaning down, shook her sister by the arm.\n\n\"Dorothy!\" she said. \"Wake up, you wretched child!\" And shook her again.\n\nMrs. Dicky groaned and yawned, and opened her eyes one at a time.\n\nBut when she saw it was Miss Patty she sat up at once, looking dazed and\nfrightened.\n\n\"You needn't pinch me, Pat!\" she said, and at that Mr. Dick wakened and\njumped up, with the carriage robe still around him.\n\n\"Oh, Dolly, Dolly!\" said Miss Patty suddenly, dropping on her knees\nbeside Mrs. Dicky, \"what a bad little girl you are! What a thing for you\nto do! Think of father and Aunt Honoria!\"\n\n\"I shan't,\" retorted Mrs. Dicky decidedly. \"I'm not going to spoil my\nhoneymoon like that. For heaven's sake, Pat, don't cry. I'm not dead.\nDick, this is my sister, Patricia.\"\n\nMiss Pat looked at him, but she didn't bow. She gave him one look, from\nhis head to his heels.\n\n\"Dolly, how COULD you!\" she said, and got up.\n\nIt wasn't very comfortable for Mr. Dick, but he took it much better than\nI expected. He went over and gave his wife a hand to help her up, and\nstill holding hers, he turned to Miss Patty.\n\n\"You are perfectly right,\" he said, \"I don't see how she could myself.\nThe more you know of me the more you'll wonder. But she did; we're up\nagainst that.\"\n\nHe grinned at Miss Patty, and after a minute Miss Patty smiled back. But\nit wasn't much of a smile. I was unpacking the breakfast, putting the\ncoffee-pot on the fire and getting ready to cook the eggs and make\ntoast. But I was watching, too. Suddenly Mrs. Dick made a dive for Miss\nPatty and threw her arms around her.\n\n\"You darling!\" she cried. \"I'm so glad to see you again--Pat, you'll\ntell father, won't you? He'll take it from you. If I tell him he'll have\napoplexy or something.\"\n\nBut Miss Patty set her pretty mouth--both those girls have their\nfather's mouth--and held her sister out at arm's length and looked at\nher.\n\n\"Listen,\" she said. \"Do you know what you have done to me? Do you know\nthat when father knows this he's going to annul the marriage or have Mr.\nCarter arrested for kidnaping or abduction?--whatever it is.\" Mrs. Dick\npuckered her face to cry, and Mr. Dick took a step forward, but Miss\nPatty waved him off. \"You know father as well as I do, Dolly. You know\nwhat he is, and lately he's been awful. He's not well--it's his liver\nagain--and he won't listen to anything. Why, the Austrian ambassador\ncame up here, all this distance, to talk about the etiquette of the--of\nmy wedding, something about precedence, and he wouldn't even see him.\"\n\n\"He can't annul it,\" said Mr. Dick angrily. \"I'm of age. And I can\nsupport my wife, too, or will be able--soon.\"\n\n\"Dolly's not of age,\" said Miss Patty wearily. \"I've sat up all night\nfiguring it out. He's going to annul the marriage, or he'll make a\nscandal anyhow, and that's just as bad. Dolly,\"--she turned to her\nsister imploringly--\"Dolly, I can't have a scandal now. You know how\nOskar's people have taken this, anyhow; they've given in, because he\ninsisted, but they don't want me, and if there's a lot of notoriety now\nthe emperor will send him to Africa or some place, and--\"\n\n\"I wish they would!\" Mrs. Carter burst out suddenly. \"I hate the whole\nthing. They only tolerate you--us--for our money. You needn't look at\nme like that; Oskar may be all right, but his mother and sisters are\nhateful--simply hateful!\"\n\n\"I'll not be with them.\"\n\n\"No, but they'll be with you.\" Mrs. Dicky walked over to the window and\nlooked out, dabbing her eyes. \"You've been everything to me, Pat, and\nI'm so happy now--I'd rather be here on a soap box with Dick than on\na throne or a dais or whatever you'll have to sit on over there, with\nOskar. I want to be happy--and you won't. Look at Alice Thorne and her\nduke!\"\n\n\"If you really want me to be happy,\" Miss Patty said, going over to her,\n\"you'll go back to school until the wedding is over.\"\n\n\"I won't leave Dicky.\" She swung around and gave Mr. Dick an adoring\nglance, and Miss Patty looked discouraged.\n\n\"Take him with you,\" she said. \"Isn't there some place near where he\ncould stay, and telephone you now and then?\"\n\n\"Telephone!\" said Mrs. Dick scornfully.\n\n\"Can't leave,\" Mr. Dick objected. \"Got to be on the property.\"\n\nMiss Patty shrugged her shoulders and turned to go. \"You're both\nperfectly hopeless,\" she said. \"I'll go and tell father, Dorothy, but\nyou know what will happen. You'll be back in school at Greenwich by\nto-night, and your--husband will probably be under arrest.\" She opened\nthe door, but I dropped the toast I was making and ran after her.\n\n\"If he is arrested,\" I said, \"they'll have to keep him on the place. He\ncan't leave.\"\n\nShe didn't say anything; she lifted her hand and looked at the ruby\nring, and then she glanced back into the room where Mr. Dick and his\nwife were whispering together, and turned up her coat collar.\n\n\"I'm going,\" she said, and stepped into the snow. But they called her\nback in a hurry.\n\n\"Look here, Miss--Miss Patricia,\" Mr. Dick said, \"why can't we stay\nhere, where we are? It's very comfortable--that is, it's livable.\nThere's plenty of fresh air, anyhow, and everybody's shouting for fresh\nair nowadays. They've got somebody to take my place in the house.\"\n\n\"And father needn't know a thing--you can fix that,\" broke in Mrs. Dick.\n\"And after your wedding he will be in a better humor; he'll know it's\nover and not up to him any more.\"\n\nMiss Patty came back to the shelter-house again and sat down on the soap\nbox.\n\n\"We MIGHT carry it off,\" she said. \"If I could only go back to town!\nBut father is in one of his tantrums, and he won't go, or let me go.\nThe idea!--with Aunt Honoria on the long-distance wire every day, having\nhysterics, and my clothes waiting to be tried on and everything. I'm\ndesperate.\"\n\n\"And all sorts of things being arranged for you!\" put in Mrs. Dick\nenviously. \"And the family jewels being reset in Vienna for you and all\nthat! It would be great--if you only didn't have to take Oskar with the\njewels!\"\n\nMiss Patty frowned.\n\n\"You are not going to marry him,\" she said, with a glance at Mr. Dick,\nwho, with his coat off, was lying flat on the floor, one arm down in the\nhole where the things had been hidden, trying to hook up a can of baked\nbeans. \"If it doesn't turn out well, you and father have certainly done\nyour part in the way of warning. It's just as Aunt Honoria said; the\nfamily will make a tremendous row beforehand, but afterward, when it all\nturns out well, they'll take the credit.\"\n\nMr. Dick was busy with the beans and I was turning the eggs. Mrs. Dick\nwent over to her sister and put her arm around her.\n\n\"That's right, Patty,\" she said, \"you're more like mother than I am.\nI'm a Jennings all over--except that, heavens be praised, I've got the\nSherwood liver. I guess I'm common plebeian, like dad, too. I'm plebeian\nenough, anyhow, to think there's been a lot too much about marriage\nsettlements and the consent of the emperor in all this, and not enough\nabout love.\"\n\nI could have patted Mrs. Dicky on the back for that, and I almost upset\nthe eggs into the fire. I'm an advocate of marrying for love every time,\nalthough a title and a bunch of family jewels thrown in wouldn't worry\nme.\n\n\"Do you want me to protest that the man who has asked me to marry him\ncares about me?\" Miss Patty replied in an angry undertone. \"Couldn't\nhe have married a thousand other girls! Hadn't a marriage been arranged\nbetween him and the cousin--\"\n\n\"I know all that,\" Mrs. Dicky said, and her voice sounded older than\nMiss Patty's, and motherly. \"But--are you in love with him, Pat?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Miss Patty said indignantly. \"Don't be silly, Dolly.\"\n\nAt that instant Mr. Dick found the beans, and got up shouting that we'd\nhave a meal fit for a prince--if princes ate anything so every day as\nbaked beans. I put the eggs on a platter and poured the coffee, and we\nall sat around the soap box and ate. I wished that Miss Cobb could have\nseen me there--how they insisted on my having a second egg, and was my\ncoffee cold, and wasn't I too close to the fire? It was Minnie here and\nMinnie there, and me next to Miss Patty on the floor, and she, as you\nmay say, right next to royalty. I wished it could have been in the\nspring-house, with father's crayon enlargement looking down on us.\n\nEverybody felt better for the meal, and we were sitting there laughing\nand talking and very cheerful when Mr. Van Alstyne opened the door and\nlooked in. His face was stern, but when he saw us, with Miss Patty on\nher knees toasting a piece of bread and Mr. Dicky passing the tin basin\nas a finger-bowl, he stopped scowling and looked amused.\n\n\"They're here, Sallie,\" he called to his wife, and they both came in,\ncovered with snow, and we had coffee and eggs all over again.\n\nWell, they stayed for an hour, and Mr. Sam talked himself black in the\nface and couldn't get anywhere. For the Dickys refused to be separated,\nand Mrs. Dick wouldn't tell her father, and Miss Patty wouldn't do it\nfor her, and the minute Mr. Sam made a suggestion that sounded rational\nMrs. Dick would cry and say she didn't care to live, anyhow, and she\nwished she had died of ptomaine poisoning the time she ate the bad\noysters at school.\n\nSo finally Mr. Sam gave up and said he washed his hands of the whole\naffair, and that he was going to make another start on his wedding\njourney, and if they wanted to be a pair of fools it wasn't up to\nhim--only for heaven's sake not to cry about it. And then he wiped\nMrs. Dicky's eyes and kissed her, she being, as he explained, his\nsister-in-law now and much too pretty for him to scold.\n\nAnd when the Dickys found they were not going to be separated we had\nmore coffee all around and everybody grew more cheerful.\n\nOh, we were very cheerful! I look back now and think how cheerful we\nwere, and I shudder. It was strange that we hadn't been warned by Mr.\nPierce's square jaw, but we were not. We sat around the fire and ate and\nlaughed, and Mr. Dick arranged that Mr. Pierce should come out to him\nevery evening for orders about the place if he accepted, and everybody\nfelt he would--and I was to come at the same time and bring a basket of\nprovisions for the next day. Of course, the instant Mr. Jennings left\nthe young couple could go into the sanatorium as guests under another\nname and be comfortable. And as soon as the time limit was up, and the\nplace was still running smoothly, they could declare the truth, claim\nthe sanatorium, having fulfilled the conditions of the will, and confess\nto Mr. Jennings--over the long-distance wire.\n\nWell, it promised well, I must say. Mr. Stitt left on the ten train that\nmorning, looking lemon-colored and mottled. He insisted that he wasn't\nable to go, but Mr. Sam gave him a headache powder and put him on the\ntrain, anyhow.\n\nYes, as I say, it promised well. But we made two mistakes: we didn't\ncount on Mr. Thoburn, and we didn't know Mr. Pierce. And who could have\nimagined that Mike the bath man would do as he did?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nANOTHER COMPLICATION\n\nAfter luncheon, when everybody at Hope Springs takes a nap, we had\nanother meeting at the shelter-house, this time with Mr. Pierce. He had\nspent the morning tramping over the hills with a gun and keeping out\nof the way of people, and what with three square meals, a good night's\nsleep and the exercise, he was looking a lot better. Seen in daylight,\nhe had very dark hair and blue-gray eyes and a very square chin,\nalthough it had a sort of dimple in it. I used to wonder which won out,\nthe dimple or the chin, but I wasn't long in finding out.\n\nWell, he looked dazed when I took him to the shelter-house and he saw\nMr. Dick and Mrs. Dick and the Mr. Sams and Miss Patty. They gave him a\nlawn-mower to sit on, and Mr. Sam explained the situation.\n\n\"I know it's asking a good bit, Mr. Pierce,\" he said, \"and personally\nI can see only one way out of all this. Carter ought to go in and take\ncharge, and his--er--wife ought to go back to school. But they won't\nhave it, and--er--there are other reasons.\" He glanced at Miss Patty.\n\nMr. Pierce also glanced at Miss Patty. He'd been glancing at her at\nintervals of two seconds ever since she came in, and being a woman and\nhaving a point to gain, Miss Patty seemed to have forgotten the night\nbefore, and was very nice to him. Once she smiled directly at him, and\nwhatever he was saying died in his throat of the shock. When she turned\nher head away he stared at the back of her neck, and when she looked at\nthe fire he gazed at her profile, and always with that puzzled look,\nas if he hadn't yet come to believe that she was the newspaper Miss\nJennings.\n\nAfter everything had been explained to him, including Mr. Jennings'\nliver and disposition, she turned to him and said:\n\n\"We are in your hands, you see, Mr. Pierce. Are you going to help us?\"\nAnd when she asked him that, it was plain to me that he was only sorry\nhe couldn't die helping.\n\n\"If everybody agrees to it,\" he said, looking at her, \"and you all think\nit's feasible and I can carry it off, I'm perfectly willing to try.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's feasible,\" Mr. Dick said in a relieved voice, getting up and\nbeginning to strut up and down the room. \"It isn't as though I'm beyond\ncall. You can come out here and consult me if you get stuck. And then\nthere's Minnie; she knows a good bit about the old place.\"\n\nMr. Sam looked at me and winked.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Mr. Dick, \"I expect to retain control, you understand\nthat, I suppose, Pierce? You can come out every day for instructions. I\ndare say sanatoriums are hardly your line.\"\n\nMr. Pierce was looking at Miss Patty and she knew it. When a woman looks\nas unconscious as she did it isn't natural.\n\n\"Eh--oh, well no, hardly,\" he said, coming to himself; \"I've tried\neverything else, I believe. It can't be worse than carrying a bunch of\nsweet peas from garden to garden.\"\n\nMr. Dick stopped walking and turned suddenly to stare at Mr. Pierce.\n\n\"Sweet--what?\" he said.\n\nEverybody else was talking, and I was the only one who saw him change\ncolor.\n\n\"Sweet peas,\" said Mr. Pierce. \"And that reminds me--I'd like to make\none condition, Mr. Carter. I feel in a measure responsible for the\ncompany; most of them have gone back to New York, but the leading woman\nis sick at the hotel in Finleyville. I'd like to bring her here for two\nweeks to recuperate. I assure you, I have no interest in her, but I'm\nsorry for her; she's had the mumps.\"\n\n\"Mumps!\" everybody said together, and Mr. Sam looked at his\nbrother-in-law.\n\n\"Kid in the play got 'em, and they spread around,\" Mr. Pierce explained.\n\"Nasty disease.\"\n\n\"Why, you've just had them, too, Dicky!\" said his wife. They all turned\nto look at him, and I must say his expression was curious.\n\nLuckily, I had the wit to knock over the breakfast basket, which was\nstill there, and when we'd gathered up the broken china, Mr. Dick had\ngot himself in hand.\n\n\"I'm sorry, old man,\" he said to Mr. Pierce, \"but I'm not in favor of\nbringing Miss--the person you speak of--up to the sanatorium just now.\nMumps, you know--very contagious, and all that.\"\n\n\"She's over that part,\" Mr. Pierce said; \"she only needs to rest.\"\n\n\"Certainly--let her come,\" said Mrs. Dicky. \"If they're as contagious as\nall that, you haven't been afraid of MY getting them.\"\n\n\"I--I'm not in favor of it,\" Mr. Dick insisted, looking obstinate.\n\"The minute you bring an actress here you've got the whole place by the\nears.\"\n\n\"Fiddlesticks!\" said his sister. \"Because any actress could set YOU by\nthe ears--\"\n\nMrs. Dick sat up suddenly.\n\n\"Certainly, if she isn't well bring her up,\" said Miss Patty.\n\"Only--won't she know your name is not Carter?\"\n\n\"She's discretion itself,\" Mr. Pierce said. \"Her salary hasn't been\npaid for a month, and as I'm responsible, I'd be glad to see her looked\nafter.\"\n\n\"I don't want her here. I'll--I'll pay her board at the hotel,\" Mr. Dick\nbegan, \"only for heaven's sake, don't--\"\n\nHe stopped, for every one was staring.\n\n\"Why in the world would you do that?\" Miss Patty asked. \"Don't be\nridiculous. That's the only condition Mr. Pierce has made.\"\n\nMr. Dick stalked to the window and looked out, his hands in his pockets.\nI couldn't help being reminded of the time he had run away from school,\nwhen his grandfather found him in the shelter-house and gave him his\nchoice of going back at once or reading medicine with him.\n\n\"Oh, bring her up! Bring her up!\" he said without looking around. \"If\nPierce won't stay unless he can play the friend in need, all right. But\ndon't come after me if the whole blamed sanatorium swells up with mumps\nand faints at the sight of a pickle.\"\n\nThat was Wednesday.\n\nThings at the sanatorium were about the same on the surface. The women\ncrocheted and wondered what the next house doctor would be like, and the\nmen gambled at the slot-machines and played billiards and grumbled at\nthe food and the management, and when they weren't drinking spring water\nthey were in the bar washing away the taste of it. They took twenty\nminutes on the verandas every day for exercise and kept the house\ntemperature at eighty. Senator Biggs was still fasting and Mrs. Biggs\ntook to spending all day in the spring-house and turning pale every time\nshe heard his voice. It was that day, I think, that I found the magazine\nwith Upton Sinclair's article on fasting stuck fast in a snow-drift, as\nif it had been thrown violently.\n\nWednesday afternoon Miss Julia Summers came with three lap robes, a\nwhite lace veil and a French poodle in a sleigh and went to bed in one\nof the best rooms, and that night we started to move out furniture to\nthe shelter-house.\n\nBy working almost all night we got the shelter-house fairly furnished,\nalthough we made a trail through the snow that looked like a fever\nchart. Toward daylight Mr. Sam dropped a wash-bowl on my toe and I went\nto bed with an arnica compress.\n\nI limped out in time to be on hand before Miss Cobb got there, but what\nwith a chilblain on my heel and hardly any sleep for two nights--not to\nmention my toe--I wasn't any too pleasant.\n\n\"It's my opinion you're overeating, Minnie,\" Miss Cobb said. \"You're\nskin's a sight!\"\n\n\"You needn't look at it,\" I retorted.\n\nShe burned the back of her neck just then and it was three minutes\nbefore she could speak. When she could she was considerably milder.\n\n\"Just give it a twist or two, Minnie, won't you?\" she said, holding out\nthe curler. \"I haven't been able to sleep on the back of my head for\nthree weeks.\"\n\nWell, I curled her hair for her and she told me about Miss Summers being\nstill shut in her room, and how she'd offered Mike an extra dollar to\ngive the white poodle a Turkish bath--it being under the weather as to\nhealth--and how Mike had soaked the little beast for an hour in a tub\nof water, forgetting the sulphur, and it had come out a sort of mustard\ncolor, and how Miss Summers had had hysterics when she saw it.\n\n\"Mike dipped him in bluing to bleach him again, or rather 'her'--it's\nname is Arabella--\" Miss Cobb said, \"but all it did was to make it\nmottled like an Easter egg. Everybody is charmed. There were no dogs\nallowed while the old doctor lived. Things were different.\"\n\n\"Yes, things were different,\" I assented, limping over to heat the\ncurler. \"How--how does Mr. Carter get along?\"\n\nMiss Cobb put down her hand-mirror and sniffed.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"goodness knows I'm no trouble maker, but somebody\nought to tell that young man a few things. He's forever looking at\nthe thermometer and opening windows. I declare, if I hadn't brought my\nwoolen tights along I'd have frozen to death at breakfast. Everybody's\ncomplaining.\"\n\nI put that away in my mind to speak about. It was only by nailing the\nwindows shut and putting strips of cotton batting around the cracks that\nwe'd ever been able to keep people there in the winter. I had my first\nmisgiving then. Heaven knows I didn't realize what it was going to be.\n\nWell, by the evening of that day things were going fairly well. Tillie\nbrought out a basket every morning to me at the spring-house,\nfairly bursting with curiosity, and Mr. Sam got some canned stuff in\nFinleyville and took it after dark to the shelter-house. But after the\nsecond day Mrs. Dicky got tired holding a frying-pan over the fire and I\nhad to carry out at least one hot meal a day.\n\nThey got their own breakfast in a chafing-dish, or rather he got it and\ncarried it to her. And she'd sit on the edge of her cot, with her feet\non the soap box--the floor was drafty--wrapped in a pink satin negligee\nwith bands of brown fur on it, looking sweet and perfectly happy, and\nlet him feed her boiled egg with a spoon. I took them some books--my\nGray's Anatomy, and Jane Eyre and Molly Bawn, by The Duchess, and the\nnewspapers, of course. They were full of talk about the wedding, and the\nsuite the prince was bringing over with him, and every now and then a\nnotice would say that Miss Dorothy Jennings, the bride's young sister,\nwho was still in school and was not coming out until next year, would be\nher sister's maid of honor. And when they came to that, they would hug\neach other--or me, if I happened to be close--and act like a pair of\nchildren, which they were. Generally it would end up by his asking\nher if she wasn't sorry she wasn't back at Greenwich studying French\nconjugations and having a dance without any men on Friday nights, and\nshe would say \"Wretch!\" and kiss him, and I'd go out and slam the door.\n\nBut there was something on Mr. Dick's mind. I hadn't known him for\nfourteen years for nothing. And the night Mr. Sam and I carried out the\ncanned salmon and corn and tomatoes he walked back with me to the edge\nof the deer park, Mr. Sam having gone ahead.\n\n\"Now,\" I said, when we were out of ear-shot, \"spit it out. I've been\nexpecting it.\"\n\n\"Listen, Minnie,\" he answered, \"is Ju--is Miss Summers still confined to\nher room?\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied coldly. \"Ju--Miss Summers was down to-night to dinner.\"\n\n\"Then she's seen Pierce,\" he said, \"and he's told her the whole story\nand by to-morrow--\"\n\n\"What?\" I demanded, clutching his arm. \"You wretched boy, don't tell me\nafter all I've done.\"\n\n\"Oh, confound it, Minnie,\" he exclaimed, \"it's as much your fault as\nmine. Couldn't you have found somebody else, instead of getting, of all\nthings on earth, somebody from the Sweet Peas Company?\"\n\n\"I see,\" I said slowly. \"Then it WASN'T coincidence about the mumps!\"\n\n\"Confounded kid had them,\" he said with bitterness. \"Minnie,\nsomething's got to be done, and done soon. If you want the plain truth,\nMiss--er--Summers and I used to be friends--and--well, she's suing\nme for breach of promise. Now for heaven's sake, Minnie, don't make a\nfuss--\"\n\nBut my knees wouldn't hold me. I dropped down in a snow-drift and\ncovered my face.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nMISS PATTY'S PRINCE\n\nI dragged myself back to the spring-house and dropped in front of the\nfire. What with worry and no sleep and now this new complication I was\ndead as yesterday's newspaper. I sat there on the floor with my hands\naround my knees, thinking what to do next, and as I sat there, the\ncrayon enlargement of father on the spring-house wall began to shake its\nhead from side to side, and then I saw it hold out its hand and point a\nfinger at me.\n\n\"Cut and run, Minnie,\" it said. \"Get out from under! Go and buy Timmon's\ncandy store before the smash--the smash--!\"\n\nWhen I opened my eyes Mr. Pierce was sitting on the other side of the\nchimney and staring at the fire. He had a pipe between his teeth, but\nhe wasn't smoking, and he had something of the same look about his mouth\nhe'd had the first day I saw him.\n\n\"Well?\" he said, when he saw I was awake.\n\n\"I guess I was sleeping.\" I sat up and pushed in my hairpins and yawned.\nI was tireder than ever. \"I'm clean worn out.\"\n\n\"Of course you're tired,\" he declared angrily. \"You're not a horse, and\nyou haven't been to bed for two nights.\"\n\n\"Care killed the cat,\" I said. \"I don't mind losing sleep, but it's like\nwalking in a swamp, Mr. Pierce. First I put a toe in--that was when I\nasked you to stay over night. Then I went a step farther, lured on, as\nyou may say, by Miss Patty waving a crown or whatever it is she wants,\njust beyond my nose. And to-night I've got a--well, to-night I'm in to\nthe neck and yelling for a quick death.\"\n\nHe leaned over to where I sat before the fire and twisted my head toward\nhim.\n\n\"To-night--what?\" he demanded.\n\nBut that minute I made up my mind not to tell him. He might think the\nsituation was too much for him and leave, or he might decide he ought to\ntell Miss Summers where Dick was. There was no love lost between him and\nMr. Carter.\n\n\"To-night--I'm just tired and cranky,\" I said, \"so--is Miss Summers\nsettled yet?\"\n\nHe nodded, as if he wasn't thinking of Miss Summers.\n\n\"What did you tell her?\"\n\n\"Haven't seen her,\" he said. \"Sent her a note that I was understudying a\nman named Carter and to mind to pick up her cues.\"\n\n\"It's a common enough name,\" I said, but he had lighted his pipe again\nand had dropped forward, one elbow on his knee, his hand holding the\nbowl of his pipe, and staring into the fire. He looked up when I closed\nand locked the pantry door.\n\n\"I've just been thinking,\" he remarked, \"here we are--a group of\npeople--all struggling like mad for one thing, but with different\nmotives. Mine are plain enough and mercenary enough, although a certain\nred-haired girl with a fine loyalty to an old doctor and a sanatorium\nis carrying me along with her enthusiasm. And Van Alstyne's motives\nare clear enough--and selfish. Carter is merely trying to save his own\nskin--but a girl like Miss Pat--Miss Jennings!\"\n\n\"There's nothing uncertain about what she wants, or wrong either,\" I\nretorted. \"She's right enough. The family can't stand a scandal just now\nwith her wedding so close.\"\n\nHe smiled and got up, emptying his pipe.\n\n\"Nevertheless, oh, Minnie, of the glowing hair and heart,\" he said,\n\"Miss Jennings has disappointed me. You see, I believe in marrying for\nlove.\"\n\n\"Love!\" I was disgusted. \"Don't talk to me about love! Love is the sort\nof thing that makes two silly idiots run away and get married and live\nin a shelter-house, upsetting everybody's plans, while their betters\nhave to worry themselves sick and carry them victuals.\"\n\nHe got up and began to walk up and down the spring-house, scowling at\nthe floor.\n\n\"Of course,\" he agreed, \"he may be a decent sort, and she may really\nwant him.\"\n\n\"Of course she does!\" I said. He stopped short. \"I've been wanting a\nset of red puffs for three years, and I can hardly walk past Mrs. Yost's\nwindow down in the village. They've got some that match my hair and I\nfairly yearn for them. But if I got 'em I dare say I'd put them in a box\nand go after wanting something else. It's the same way with Miss Patty.\nShe'll get her prince, and because it isn't real love, but only the same\nas me with the puffs, she'll go after wanting something else. Only she\ncan't put him away in a box. She'll have to put him on and wear him for\nbetter, for worse.\"\n\n\"Lord help her!\" he said solemnly, and went over to the window and stood\nthere looking out.\n\nI went over beside him. From the window we could see the three rows of\nyellow lights that marked the house, and somebody with a lantern was\ngoing down the path toward the stables. Mr. Pierce leaned forward, his\nhands at the top of the window-sash, and put his forehead against the\nglass.\n\n\"Why is it that a lighted window in a snow-storm always makes a fellow\nhomesick?\" he said in his half-mocking way. \"If he hasn't got a home it\nmakes him want one.\"\n\n\"Well, why don't you get one?\" I asked.\n\n\"On nothing a year?\" he said. \"Not even prospects! And set up\nhousekeeping in the shelter-house with my good friend Minnie carrying\nus food and wearing herself to a shadow, not to mention bringing trashy\nbooks to my bride.\"\n\n\"She isn't that kind,\" I broke in, and got red. I'd been thinking of\nMiss Patty. But he went over to the table and picked up his glass of\nspring water, only to set it down untasted.\n\n\"No, she's not that kind!\" he agreed, and never noticed the slip.\n\n\"You know, Minnie, women aren't all alike, but they're not all\ndifferent. An English writer has them classified to a T--there's the\nmother woman--that's you. You're always mothering somebody with that\nmaternal spirit of yours. It's a pity it's vicarious.\"\n\nI didn't say anything, not knowing just what he meant. But I've looked\nit up since and I guess he was about right.\n\n\"And there's the mistress woman--Mrs. Dicky, for example, or--\" he saw\nMiss Cobb's curler on the mantel and picked it up--\"or even Miss Cobb,\"\nhe said. \"Coquetry and selfishness without maternal instinct. How\nmuch of Miss Cobb's virtue is training and environment, Minnie, not to\nmention lack of temptation, and how much was born in her?\"\n\n\"She's a preacher's daughter,\" I remarked. I could understand about Mrs.\nDicky, but I thought he was wrong about Miss Cobb.\n\n\"Exactly,\" he said. \"And the third kind of woman is the mistress-mother\nkind, and they're the salt of the earth, Minnie.\" He began to walk up\nand down by the spring with his hands in his pockets and a far-away look\nin his eyes. \"The man who marries that kind of woman is headed straight\nfor paradise.\"\n\n\"That's the way!\" I snapped. \"You men have women divided into classes\nand catalogued like horses on sale.\"\n\n\"Aren't they on sale?\" he demanded, stopping. \"Isn't it money, or\nliberty, or--or a title, usually?\" I knew he was thinking of Miss Patty\nagain.\n\n\"As for the men,\" I continued, \"I guess you can class the married ones\nin two classes, providers and non-providers. They're all selfish and\nthey haven't enough virtue to make a fuss about.\"\n\n\"I'd be a shining light in the non-provider class,\" he said, and picking\nup his old cap he opened the door. Miss Patty herself was coming up the\npath.\n\nShe was flushed from the cold air and from hurrying, and I don't know\nthat I ever saw her look prettier. When she came into the light we could\nboth see that she was dressed for dinner. Her fur coat was open at\nthe neck, and she had only a lace scarf over her head. (She was\na disbeliever in colds, anyhow, and all winter long she slept with the\nwindows open and the steam-heat off!)\n\n\"I'm so glad you're still here, Minnie!\" she exclaimed, breathing fast.\n\"You haven't taken the dinner out to the shelter-house yet, have you?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" I replied. \"Tillie hasn't brought the basket. The chef's been\nfussing about the stuff we're using in the diet kitchen the last few\ndays, and I wouldn't be surprised if he's shut off all extras.\"\n\nBut I guess her sister and Mr. Dick could have starved to death just\nthen without her noticing. She was all excitement, for all she's mostly\nso cool.\n\n\"I have a note here for my sister,\" she said, getting it out of her\npocket. \"I know we all impose on you, Minnie, but--will you take it for\nme? I'd go, but I'm in slippers, and, anyhow, I'd need a lantern, and\nthat would be reckless, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"In slippers!\" Mr. Pierce interrupted. \"It's only five degrees above\nzero! Of all the foolhardy--!\"\n\nMiss Patty did not seem to hear him. She gave the letter to me and\nfollowed me out on the step.\n\n\"You're a saint, Minnie,\" she said, leaning over and squeezing my arm,\n\"and because you're going back and forth in the cold so much, I want you\nto have this--to keep.\"\n\nShe stooped and picked up from the snow beside the steps something soft\nand furry and threw it around my neck, and the next instant I knew\nshe was giving me her chinchilla set, muff and all. I was so pleased I\ncried, and all the way over to the shelter-house I sniveled and danced\nwith joy at the same time. There's nothing like chinchilla to tone down\nred hair.\n\nWell, I took the note out to the shelter-house, and rapped. Mr. Dick let\nme in, and it struck me he wasn't as cheerful as usual. He reached out\nand took the muff.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"I thought that was the supper.\"\n\n\"It's coming,\" I said, looking past him for Mrs. Dicky. Usually when\nI went there she was drawing Mr. Dick's profile on a bit of paper or\nteaching him how to manicure his nails, but that night she was lying on\nthe cot and she didn't look up.\n\n\"Sleeping?\" I asked in a whisper.\n\n\"Grumping!\" Mr. Dick answered. He went over and stood looking down at\nher with his hands in his pockets and his hair ruffled as if he'd been\nrunning his fingers through it. She never moved a shoulder.\n\n\"Dorothy,\" he said. \"Here's Minnie.\"\n\nShe pretended not to hear.\n\n\"Dorothy!\" he repeated. \"I wish you wouldn't be such a g--Confound it,\nDolly, be reasonable. Do you want to make me look like a fool?\"\n\nShe turned her face enough to uncover one eye.\n\n\"It wouldn't be difficult,\" she answered, staring at him with the one\neye. It was red from crying.\n\n\"Now listen, Dolly.\" He got down on one knee beside the cot and tried to\ntake her hand, but she jerked it away. \"I've tried wearing my hair that\nway, and it--it isn't becoming, to say the least. I don't mind having it\nwet and brushed back in a pompadour, if you insist, but I certainly do\nbalk at the ribbon.\"\n\n\"You've only got to wear the ribbon an hour or so, until it dries.\" She\nbrought her hand forward an inch or so and he took it and kissed it. It\nshould have been slapped.\n\n\"I'll tell you what I'll do,\" he said. \"You can fix it any way you\nplease, when it's too late for old Sam or Pierce to drop in, and I'll\nwear the confounded ribbon all night. Won't that do?\"\n\nBut she had seen the note and sat up and held out her hand for it. She\nwas wearing one of Miss Patty's dresses and it hung on her--not that\nMiss Patty was large, but she had a beautiful figure, and Mrs. Dicky, of\ncourse, was still growing and not properly filled out.\n\n\"Dick!\" she said suddenly, \"what do you think? Oskar is here! Pat's in\nthe wildest excitement. He's in town, and Aunt Honoria has telephoned\nto know what to do! Listen: he is incog., of course, and registered as\nOskar von Inwald. He did an awfully clever thing--came in through Canada\nwhile the papers thought he was in St. Moritz.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake,\" replied Mr. Dick, \"tell her not to ask him here. I\nshouldn't know how to talk to him.\"\n\n\"He speaks lovely English,\" declared Mrs. Dick, still reading.\n\n\"I know all that,\" he said, walking around nervously, \"but if he's going\nto be my brother-in-law, I suppose I don't get down on my knees and\nknock my head on the floor. What do I say to him? Your Highness? Oh,\nI've known a lord or two, but that's different. You call them anything\nyou like and lend them money.\"\n\n\"I dare say you can with Oskar, too.\" Mrs. Dicky put the note down and\nsighed. \"Well, he's coming. Pat says dad won't go back to town until\nhe's had twenty-one baths, and he's only had eleven and she's got to\nstay with him. And you needn't worry about what to call Oskar. He's not\nto know we're here.\"\n\nI was worried on my way back to the spring-house--not that the prince\nwould make much difference, as far as I could see things being about as\nbad as they could be. But some of the people were talking of leaving,\nand since we had to have a prince it seemed a pity he wasn't coming\nwith all his retinue and titles. It would have been a good ten thousand\ndollars' worth of advertising for the place, and goodness knows we\nneeded it.\n\nWhen I got back to the spring-house Miss Patty and Mr. Pierce were still\nthere. He was in front of the fire, with his back to it, and she was\nnear the door.\n\n\"Of course it isn't my affair,\" he was saying. \"You are perfectly--\"\nThen I opened the door and he stopped. I went on into the pantry to take\noff my overshoes, and as I closed the door he continued. \"I didn't mean\nto say what I have. I meant to explain about the other night--I had a\nright to do that. But you forced the issue.\"\n\n\"I was compelled to tell you he was coming,\" she said angrily. \"I felt\nI should. You have been good enough to take Mr. Carter's place here and\nsave me from an embarrassing situation--\"\n\n\"I had no philanthropic motives,\" he insisted stubbornly. \"I did it,\nas you must know, for three meals a day and a roof over my head. If you\nwish me to be entirely frank, I disapprove of the whole thing.\"\n\nI heard the swish of her dress as she left the door and went toward him.\n\n\"What would you have had me do?\" she asked.\n\n\"Take those two children to your father. What if there was a row?\nWhy should there be such a lot made of it, anyhow? They're young, but\nthey'll get older. It isn't a crime for two people to--er--love each\nother, is it? And if you think a scandal or two in your family--granting\nyour father would make a scandal--is going to put another patch on the\nragged reputations of the royal family of--\"\n\n\"How dare you!\" she cried furiously. \"How DARE you!\"\n\nI heard her cross the room and fling the door open and a second later it\nslammed. When I came out of the pantry Mr. Pierce was sitting in his old\nposition, elbow on knee, holding his pipe and staring at the bowl.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nWE GET A DOCTOR\n\nI had my hands full the next day. We'd had another snow-storm during\nthe night and the trains were blocked again. About ten o'clock we got\na telegram from the new doctor we'd been expecting, that he'd fallen\non the ice on his way to the train and broken his arm, and at eleven a\ndelegation from the guests waited on Mr. Pierce and told him they'd have\nto have a house physician at once.\n\nSenator Biggs was the spokesman. He said that, personally, he couldn't\nremain another day without one; that he should be under a physician's\ncare every moment of his fast, and that if no doctor came that day\nhe'd be in favor of all the guests showing their displeasure by leaving\ntogether.\n\n\"Either that,\" Thoburn said from the edge of the crowd, \"or call it a\nhotel at once and be done with it. A sanatorium without a doctor is like\nan omelet without eggs!\"\n\n\"Hamlet without ham,\" somebody said.\n\n\"We're doing the best we can,\" Mr. Pierce explained. \"We--we expect a\ndoctor to-day.\"\n\n\"When?\" from Mr. Jennings, who had come on a cane and was watching Mr.\nPierce like a hawk.\n\n\"This afternoon, probably. As there is no one here very ill--\"\n\nBut at that they almost fell on him and tore him to pieces. I had to\nstep in front of him myself and say we'd have somebody there by two\no'clock if we had to rob a hospital to get him. And Mr. Sam cried,\n\"Three cheers for Minnie, the beautiful spring-house girl!\" and led off.\n\nThere's no doubt about it--a man ought to be born to the sanatorium\nbusiness. A real strong and healthy man has no business trying to run\na health resort, and I saw Mr. Pierce wasn't making the hit that I'd\nexpected him to.\n\nHe was too healthy. You only needed to look at him to know that he took\na cold plunge every morning, and liked to walk ten miles a day, and\ncould digest anything and go to sleep the minute his head touched the\npillow. And he had no tact. When Mrs. Biggs went to him and explained\nthat the vacuum cleaner must not be used in her room--that it exhausted\nthe air or something, and she could hardly breathe after it--he only\nlooked bewildered and then drew a diagram to show her it was impossible\nthat it could exhaust the air. The old doctor knew how: he'd have\nordered an oxygen tank opened in the room after the cleaner was used and\nshe'd have gone away happy.\n\nOf course Mr. Pierce was most polite. He'd listen to their\ncomplaints--and they were always complaining, that's part of the\nregime--with a puzzled face, trying to understand, but he couldn't.\nHe hadn't a nerve in his body. Once, when one of the dining-room girls\ndropped a tray of dishes and half the women went to bed with headache\nfrom the nervous shock, he never even looked up, but went on with his\ndinner, and the only comment he made afterward was to tell the head\nwaitress to see that Annie didn't have to pay breakage--that the\ntrays were too heavy for a woman, anyhow. As Miss Cobb said, he was\nimpossible.\n\nWell, as if I didn't have my hands full with getting meals to the\nshelter-house, and trying to find a house doctor, and wondering how long\nit would be before \"Julia\" came face to face with Dick Carter somewhere\nor other, and trying to keep one eye on Thoburn while I kept Mr. Pierce\nstraight with the other--that day, during luncheon, Mike the bath man\ncame out to the spring-house and made a howl about his wages. He'd been\nlooking surly for two days.\n\n\"What about your wages?\" I snapped. \"Aren't you getting what you've\nalways had?\"\n\n\"No tips!\" he said sulkily. \"Only a few taking baths--only one daily,\nand that's that man Jennings. There's no use talking, Miss Minnie, I've\ngot to have a double percentage on that man or you'll have to muzzle\nhim. He--he's dangerous.\"\n\n\"If I give you the double percentage, will you stay?\"\n\n\"I don't know but that I'd rather have the muzzle, Miss Minnie,\" he\nanswered slowly, \"but--I'll stay. It won't be for long.\"\n\nWhich left me thinking. I'd seen Thoburn talking to Mike more than once\nlately, and he'd been going around with an air of assurance that didn't\nmake me any too cheerful. Evenings, when I'd relieved Amanda King at the\nnews stand, I'd seen Thoburn examining the woodwork of the windows, and\nonly the night before, happening on the veranda unexpectedly, I found\nMike and him measuring it with a tape line. As I say, Mike's visit left\nme thinking.\n\nThe usual crowd came out that afternoon and drank water and sat around\nthe fire and complained--all except Senator Biggs, who happened in just\nas I was pouring melted butter over a dish of hot salted pop-corn.\nHe stood just inside the door, sniffling, with his eyes fixed on the\nbutter, and then groaned and went out.\n\nHe looked terrible--his clothes hung on him like bags; as the bishop\nsaid, it was ghastly to see a convexity change to such a concavity in\nthree days.\n\nMr. Moody won three dollars that day from the slot-machine and was\nalmost civil to his wife, but old Jennings sat with his foot on a stool\nand yelled if anybody slammed the door. Mrs. Hutchins brought him out\nwith her eyes red and asked me if she could leave him there.\n\n\"I'm sorry if I was rude to you the other night, Minnie,\" she said, \"but\nI was upset. I'm so worn-out that I'll have to lie down for an hour, and\nif he doesn't get better soon, I--I shall have to have help. My nerves\nare gone.\"\n\nAt four o'clock Mr. Sam came in, and he had Mr. Thoburn tight by the\narm.\n\n\"My dear old chap,\" he was saying, \"it would be as much as your life's\nworth. That ground is full of holes and just now covered with snow--!\"\n\nHe caught my eye, and wiped his forehead.\n\n\"Heaven help us!\" he said, coming over to the spring, \"I found him\nmaking for the shelter-house, armed with a foot rule! Somebody's got to\ntake him in hand--I tell you, the man's a menace!\"\n\n\"What about the doctor?\" I asked, reaching up his glass.\n\n\"Be here to-night,\" he answered, \"on the--\"\n\nBut at that minute a boy brought a telegram down and handed it to him.\nThe new doctor was laid up with influenza!\n\nWe sat there after the others had gone, and Mr. Sam said he was for\ngiving up the fight, only to come out now with the truth would mean such\na lot of explaining and a good many people would likely find it funny.\nMr. Pierce came in later and we gave him the telegram to read.\n\n\"I don't see why on earth they need a doctor, anyhow,\" he said, \"they're\nnot sick. If they'd take a little exercise and get some air in their\nlungs--\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" Mr. Sam cried in despair, \"some people are born\nin sanatoriums, some acquire them, and others have them thrust upon\nthem--I've had this place thrust upon me. I don't know why they want a\ndoctor, but they do. They balked at Rodgers from the village. They want\nsomebody here at night. Mr. Jennings has the gout and there's the deuce\nto pay. Some of them talk of leaving.\"\n\n\"Let 'em leave,\" said Mr. Pierce. \"If they'd go home and drink three\ngallons of any kind of pure water a day--\"\n\n\"Sh! That's heresy here! My dear fellow, we've got to keep them.\"\n\nMr. Pierce glanced at the telegram and handed it back.\n\n\"Lot's of starving M. D.'s would jump at the chance,\" he said, \"but if\nit's as urgent as all this we can't wait to hunt. I'll tell you, Van\nAlstyne, there's a chap down in the village he was the character man\nwith the Sweet Peas Company--and he's stranded there. I saw him this\nmorning. He's washing dishes in the depot restaurant for his meals.\nWe used to call him Doc, and I've a hazy idea that he's a graduate M.\nD.--name's Barnes.\"\n\n\"Great!\" cried Mr. Van Alstyne. \"Let's have Barnes. You get him, will\nyou, Pierce?\"\n\nMr. Pierce promised and they started out together. At the door Mr. Sam\nturned.\n\n\"Oh, by the way, Minnie,\" he called, \"better gild one of your chairs and\nput a red cushion on it. The prince has arrived.\"\n\nWell, I thought it all out that afternoon as I washed the glasses, and\nit was terrible. I had two people in the shelter-house to feed and look\nafter like babies, with Tillie getting more curious every day about\nthe basket she brought, and not to be held much longer; and I had a man\nrunning the sanatorium and running it to the devil as fast as it could\ngo. Not that he wasn't a nice young man, big, strong-jawed and all that,\nbut you can't make a diplomat out of an ordinary man in three days, and\nit takes more diplomacy to run a sanatorium a week than it does to be\nsecretary of state for four years. Then I had a prince incognito, and\nThoburn stirring up mischief, and the servants threatening to strike,\nand no house doctor--\n\nJust as I got to that somebody opened the door behind me and looked in.\nI glanced around, and it was a man with the reddest hair I ever saw.\nMine was pale by comparison. He was rather short and heavy-set, and he\nhad a pleasant face, although not handsome, his nose being slightly bent\nto the left. But at first all I could see was his hair.\n\n\"Good evening,\" he said, edging himself in. \"Are you Miss Waters?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, rising and getting a glass ready, \"although I'm not\ncalled that often, except by people who want to pun on my name and my\nbusiness.\" I looked at him sharply, but he hadn't intended any pun.\n\nHe took off his hat and came over to the spring where I was filling his\nglass.\n\n\"If that's for me, you needn't bother,\" he said. \"If it tastes as it\nsmells, I'm not thirsty. My name's Barnes, and I was to wait here for\nMr. Van Alstyne.\"\n\n\"Barnes!\" I repeated. \"Then you're the doctor.\"\n\nHe grinned, and stood turning his hat around in his hands.\n\n\"Not exactly,\" he said. \"I graduated in medicine a good many years ago,\nbut after a year of it, wearing out more seats of trousers waiting\nfor patients than I earned enough to pay for, and having to have new\ntrousers, I took to other things.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" I said. \"You're an actor now.\"\n\nHe looked thoughtful.\n\n\"Some people think I'm not,\" he answered, \"but I'm on the stage.\nGraduated there from prize-fighting. Prize-fighting, the stage, and then\nwriting for magazines--that's the usual progression. Sometimes, as a\nsort of denouement before the final curtain, we have dinner at the White\nHouse.\"\n\nI took a liking to the man at once. It was a relief to have somebody\nwho was willing to tell all about himself and wasn't incognito, or in\nhiding, or under somebody else's name. I put a fresh log on the fire,\nand as it blazed up I saw him looking at me.\n\n\"Ye gods and little fishes!\" he said. \"Another redhead! Why, we're as\nalike as two carrots off the same bunch!\"\n\nIn five minutes I knew how old he was, and where he was raised, and that\nwhat he wanted more than anything on earth was a little farmhouse with\nchickens and a cow.\n\n\"Where you can have air, you know,\" he said, waving his hands, which\nwere covered with reddish hair. \"Lord, in the city I starve for air! And\nwhere, when you're getting soft you can go out and tackle the wood-pile.\nThat's living!\"\n\nAnd then he wanted to know what he was to do at the sanatorium and\nI told him as well as I could. I didn't tell him everything, but I\nexplained why Mr. Pierce was calling himself Carter, and about the two\nin the shelter-house. I had to. He knew as well as I did that three days\nbefore Mr. Pierce had had nothing to his name but a folding automobile\nroad map or whatever it was.\n\n\"Good for old Pierce!\" he said when I finished. \"He's a prince, Miss\nWaters. If you'd seen him sending those girls back to town--well, I'll\ndo all I can to help him. But I'm not much of a doctor. It's safe to\nacknowledge it; you'll find it out soon enough.\"\n\nMr. and Mrs. Van Alstyne came in just then, and Mr. Sam told him what\nhe was expected to do. It wasn't much: he was to tell them at what\ntemperatures to take their baths, \"and Minnie will help you out with\nthat,\" he added, and what they were to eat and were not to eat. \"Minnie\nwill tell you that, too,\" he finished, and Mr. Barnes, DOCTOR Barnes,\ncame over and shook my hand.\n\n\"I'm perfectly willing to be first assistant,\" he declared. \"We'll put\nour heads together and the result will be--\"\n\n\"Combustion!\" said Mr. Sam, and we all laughed.\n\n\"Remember,\" Mr. Sam instructed him, as Doctor Barnes started out, \"when\nyou don't know what to prescribe, order a Turkish bath. The baths are to\na sanatorium what the bar is to a club--they pay the bills.\"\n\nWell, we got it all fixed and Doctor Barnes started out, but at the door\nhe stopped.\n\n\"I say,\" he asked in an undertone, \"the stork doesn't light around here,\ndoes he?\"\n\n\"Not if they see him first!\" I replied grimly, and he went out.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE PRINCE--PRINCIPALLY\n\nIt was all well enough for me to say--as I had to to Tillie many a\ntime--that it was ridiculous to make a fuss over a person for what,\nafter all, was an accident of birth. It was well enough for me to say\nthat it was only by chance that I wasn't strutting about with a crown on\nmy head and a man blowing a trumpet to let folks know I was coming, and\nby the same token and the same chance Prince Oskar might have been a\nred-haired spring-house girl, breaking the steels in her figure stooping\nover to ladle mineral water out of a hole in the earth.\n\nNevertheless, at five o'clock, after every one had gone, when I saw Miss\nPatty, muffled in furs, tripping out through the snow, with a tall thin\nman beside her, walking very straight and taking one step to her four, I\nfelt as though somebody had hit me at the end of my breast-bone.\n\nThey stopped a minute outside before they came in, and I had to take\nmyself in hand.\n\n\"Now look here, Minnie, you idiot,\" I said to myself, \"this is America;\nyou're as good as he is; not a bend of the knee or a stoop of the neck.\nAnd if he calls you 'my good girl' hit him.\"\n\nThey came in together, laughing and talking, and, to be honest, if I\nhadn't caught the back of a chair, I'd have had one foot back of the\nother and been making a courtesy in spite of myself.\n\n\"We're late, Minnie!\" Miss Patty said. \"Oskar, this is one of my best\nfriends, and you are to be very nice to her.\"\n\nHe had one of those single glass things in his eye and he gave me a good\nstare through it. Seen close he was handsomer than Mr. Pierce, but he\nlooked older than his picture.\n\n\"Ask her if she won't be nice to me,\" he said in as good English as\nmine, and held out his hand.\n\n\"Any of Miss Patty's friends--\" I began, with a lump in my throat, and\ngave his hand a good squeeze. I thought he looked startled, and suddenly\nI had a sort of chill.\n\n\"Good gracious!\" I exclaimed, \"should I have kissed it?\"\n\nThey roared at that, and Miss Patty had to sit down in a chair.\n\n\"You see, she knows, Oskar,\" she said. \"The rest are thinking and\nperhaps guessing, but Minnie is the only one that knows, and she never\ntalks. Everybody who comes here tells Minnie his troubles.\"\n\n\"But--am I a trouble?\" he asked in a low tone. I was down in the spring,\nbut I heard it.\n\n\"So far you have hardly been an unalloyed joy,\" she replied, and from\nthe spring I echoed \"Amen.\"\n\n\"Yes--I'm so hung with family skeletons that I clatter when I walk,\" I\nexplained, pretending I hadn't heard, and brought them both glasses of\nwater. \"It's got to be a habit with some people to save their sciatica\nand their husband's dispositions and their torpid livers and their\nunpaid bills and bring 'em here to me.\"\n\nHe sniffed at the glass and put it down.\n\n\"Herr Gott!\" he said, \"what a water! It is--the whole thing is\nextraordinary! I can understand the reason for Carlsbad or Wiesbaden--it\nis gay. One sees one's friends; it is--social. But here--!\"\n\nHe got up and, lifting a window curtain, peered out into the snow.\n\n\"Here,\" he repeated, \"shut in by forests and hills, a thousand miles\nfrom life--\" He shrugged his shoulders and came back to the table. \"It\nis well enough for the father,\" he went on to Miss Patty, \"but for you!\nWhy--it is depressing, gray. The only bit of color in it all is--here,\nin what you call the spring-house.\" I thought he meant Miss Patty's\ncheeks or her lovely violet eyes, but he was looking at my hair. I had\ncaught his eye on it before, but this time he made no secret about it,\nand he sighed, for all the world as if it reminded him of something.\nHe went over to the slot-machine and stood in front of it, humming and\ntrying the different combinations. I must say he had a nice back.\n\nMiss Patty came over and slipped her hand in mine.\n\n\"Well?\" she whispered, looking at me with her pretty eyebrows raised.\n\n\"He looks all right,\" I had to confess. \"Perhaps you can coax him to\nshave.\"\n\nShe laughed.\n\n\"Oskar!\" she called, \"you have passed, but you are conditioned. Minnie\nobjects to the mustache.\"\n\nHe turned and looked at me gravely.\n\n\"It is my--greatest attraction,\" he declared, \"but it is also a great\ncare. If Miss Minnie demands it, I shall give it to her in a--in a\nlittle box.\" He sauntered over and looked at me in his audacious way.\n\"But you must promise to care for it. Many women have loved it.\"\n\n\"I believe that!\" I answered, and stared back at him without blinking.\n\"I guess I wouldn't want the responsibility.\"\n\nBut I had an idea that he meant what he said about the many women, and\nthat Miss Patty knew it as well as I did. She flushed a little, and\nthey went very soon after that. I stood and watched them until they\ndisappeared in the snow, and I felt lonelier than ever, and sad,\nalthough certainly he was better than I had expected to find him. He was\na man, and not a little cub with a body hardly big enough to carry his\nforefathers' weaknesses. But he had a cold eye and a warm mouth,\nand that sort of man is generally a social success and a matrimonial\nfailure.\n\nIt wasn't until toward night that I remembered I'd been talking to a\nreal prince and I hadn't once said \"your Highness\" or \"your Excellency\"\nor whatever I should have said. I had said \"You!\"\n\nI had hardly closed the door after them when it opened again and Mr.\nPierce came in. He shut the door and, going over to one of the tables,\nput a package down on it.\n\n\"Here's the stuff you wanted for the spring, Minnie,\" he announced. \"I\nsuppose I can't do anything more than register a protest against it?\"\n\n\"You needn't bother doing that,\" I answered, \"unless it makes you feel\nbetter. Your authority ends at that door. Inside the spring-house I'm in\ncontrol.\"\n\n(It's hard to believe, with things as they are, that I once really\nbelieved that. But I did. It was three full days later that I learned\nthat I'd been mistaken!)\n\nWell, he sat there and looked at nothing while I heated water in my\nbrass kettle over the fire and dissolved the things against Thoburn's\nquick eye the next day, and he didn't say anything. He had a gift for\nkeeping quiet, Mr. Pierce had. It got on my nerves after a while.\n\n\"Things are doing better,\" I remarked, stirring up my mixture.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, without moving.\n\n\"I suppose they're happier now they have a doctor?\"\n\n\"Yes--no--I don't know. He's not much of a doctor, you know--and there\ndon't seem to be any medical books around.\"\n\n\"There's one on the care and feeding of infants in the circulating\nlibrary,\" I said, \"and he can have my Anatomy.\"\n\n\"You're generous!\" he remarked, with one of his quick smiles.\n\n\"It's a book,\" I snapped, and fell to stirring again. But he was moping\nonce more, with his feet out and his hands behind his head, staring at\nthe ceiling.\n\n\"I say, Minnie--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Miss--Miss Jennings and the von Inwald were here just now, weren't\nthey? I passed them on the bridge.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What--how do you like him?\"\n\n\"Better than I expected and not so well as I might,\" I said. \"If you are\ngoing to the house soon you might take Miss Patty her handkerchief. It's\nthere under that table.\"\n\nI took my mixture into the pantry and left it to cool. But as I started\nback I stopped. He had got the handkerchief and was standing in front of\nthe fire, holding it in the palm of his hand and looking at it. And all\nin a minute he crushed it to his face with both hands and against the\nfirelight I could see him quivering.\n\nI stepped back into the pantry and came out again noisily. He\nwas standing very calm and quiet where he had been before, and no\nhandkerchief in sight.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"did you get it?\"\n\n\"Get what?\"\n\n\"Miss Patty's handkerchief?\"\n\n\"Oh--that! Yes. Here it is.\" He pulled it out of his pocket and held it\nup by the corner.\n\n\"Ridiculous size, isn't it, and--\" he held it up to his nose--\"I dare\nsay one could almost tell it was hers by the scent. It's--it's like\nher.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" I said, suddenly suspicious, and looked at it. \"Well,\" I said,\n\"it may remind you of Miss Patty, and the scent may be like Miss Patty,\nbut she doesn't use perfume on her handkerchief. This has an E. C. on\nit, which means Eliza Cobb.\"\n\nHe left soon after, rather crestfallen, but to save my life I couldn't\nforget what I'd seen--him with that scrap of linen that he thought was\nhers crushed to his face, and his shoulders heaving. I had an idea that\nhe hadn't cared much for women before, and that, this being a first\nattack, he hadn't established what the old doctor used to call an\nimmunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nPIERCE DISAPPROVES\n\nMrs. Hutchins came out to the spring-house the next morning. She was\ndressed in a black silk with real lace collar and cuffs, and she was so\npuffed up with pride that she forgot to be nasty to me.\n\n\"I thought I'd better come to you, Minnie,\" she said. \"There seems to be\nnobody in authority here any more. Mr. Carter has put the--has put Mr.\nvon Inwald in the north wing. I can not imagine why he should have given\nhim the coldest and most disagreeable part of the house.\"\n\nI said I'd speak to Mr. Carter and try to have him moved, and she\nrustled over to where I was brushing the hearth and stooped down.\n\n\"Mr. von Inwald is incognito, of course,\" she said, \"but he belongs to a\nvery old family in his own country--a noble family. He ought to have the\nbest there is in the house.\"\n\nI promised that, too, and she went away, but I made up my mind to talk\nto Mr. Pierce. The sanatorium business isn't one where you can put your\nown likes and dislikes against the comfort of the guests.\n\nMiss Cobb came out a few minutes after; she had on her new green silk\nwith the white lace trimming. She saw me staring as she threw off her\ncape and put her curler on the log.\n\n\"It's a little dressy for so early, of course, Minnie,\" she said, \"but\nI wish you'd see some of the other women! Breakfast looked like an\nafternoon reception. What would you think of pinning this black velvet\nribbon around my head?\"\n\n\"It might have done twenty years ago, Miss Cobb,\" I answered, \"but I\nwouldn't advise it now.\" I was working at the slot-machine, and I heard\nher sniff behind me as she hung up her mirror on the window-frame.\n\nShe tried the curler on the curtain, which she knows I object to, but\nshe was too full of her subject to be sulky for long.\n\n\"I wish you could see Blanche Moody!\" she began again, standing holding\nthe curler, with a thin wreath of smoke making a halo over her head.\n\"Drawn in--my dear, I don't see how she can breathe! I guess there's no\ndoubt about Mr. von Inwald.\"\n\n\"I'd like to know who put this beer check in the slot-machine\nyesterday,\" I said as indifferently as I could. \"What about Mr. von\nInwald?\"\n\nShe tiptoed over to me, the halo trailing after her.\n\n\"About his being a messenger from the prince to Miss Jennings!\" she\nanswered in a whisper. \"He spent last night closeted with papa, and\nthe chambermaid on that floor told Lily Biggs that there was almost a\nquarrel.\"\n\n\"That doesn't mean anything,\" I objected. \"If the Angel Gabriel was shut\nin with Mr. Jennings for ten minutes he'd be blowing his trumpet for\nhelp.\"\n\nMiss Cobb shrugged her shoulders and took hold of a fresh wisp of hair\nwith the curler.\n\n\"I dare say,\" she assented, \"but the Angel Gabriel wouldn't have\nwaited to breakfast with Miss Jennings, and have kissed her hand before\neverybody at the foot of the stairs!\"\n\n\"Is he handsome?\" I asked, curious to know how he would impress other\nwomen. But Miss Cobb had never seen a man she would call ugly.\n\n\"Handsome!\" she said. \"My dear, he's beautiful! He has a duel scar on\nhis left cheek--all the nobility have them over there. I've a cousin\nliving in Berlin--she's the wittiest person--and she says the German\nchild of the future will be born with a scarred left cheek!\"\n\nWell, I was sick enough of hearing of Mr. von Inwald before the day was\nover. All morning in the spring-house they talked Mr. von Inwald. They\npretended to play cards, but they were really playing European royalty.\nEvery time somebody laid down a queen, he'd say, \"Is the queen still\nliving, or didn't she die a few years ago?\" And when they played the\nknave, they'd start off about the prince again. They'd all decided that\nMr. von Inwald was noble--somebody said that the \"von\" was a sort of\ntitle. The women were planning to make the evenings more cheerful, too.\nThey couldn't have a dance with the men using canes or forbidden to\nexercise, but Miss Cobb had a lot of what she called \"parlor games\" that\nshe wanted to try out. \"Introducing the Jones family\" was one of them.\n\nIn the afternoon Mr. von Inwald came out to the spring-house and sat\naround, very affable and friendly, drinking the water. He and the bishop\ngrew quite chummy. Miss Patty was not there, but about four o'clock Mr.\nPierce came out. He did not sit down, but wandered around the room, not\ntalking to anybody, but staring, whenever he could, at the prince. Once\nI caught Mr. von Inwald's eyes fixed on him, as if he might have seen\nhim before. After a while Mr. Pierce sat down in a corner like a sulky\nchild and filled his pipe, and as nobody noticed him except to complain\nabout the pipe, which he didn't even hear, he sat there for a half-hour,\nbent forward, with his pipe clenched in his teeth, and never took his\neyes off Mr. von Inwald's face.\n\nSenator Biggs was the one who really caused the trouble. He spent a good\ndeal of time in the spring-house trying to fool his stomach by keeping\nit filled up all the time with water. He had got past the cranky stage,\nbeing too weak for it; his face was folded up in wrinkles like an\naccordion and his double chin was so flabby you could have tucked it\naway inside his collar.\n\n\"What do you think of American women, Mr. von Inwald?\" he asked, and\neverybody stopped playing cards and listened for the answer. As Mr.\nvon Inwald represented the prince, wouldn't he be likely to voice the\nprince's opinion of American women?\n\nIt's my belief Mr. von Inwald was going to say something nice. He\nsmiled as if he meant to, but just then he saw Mr. Pierce in his corner\nsneering behind his pipe. They looked at each other steadily, and nobody\ncould mistake the hate in Mr. Pierce's face or his sneer. After a minute\nthe prince looked away and shrugged his shoulders, but he didn't make\nhis pretty speech.\n\n\"American women!\" he said, turning his glass of spring water around\non the table before him, \"they are very lovely, of course.\" He looked\naround and there were Mrs. Moody and Mrs. Biggs and Miss Cobb, and he\neven glanced at me in the spring. Then he looked again at Mr. Pierce and\nkept his eyes there. \"But they are spoiled, fearfully spoiled. They rule\ntheir parents and they expect to rule their husbands. In Europe we do\nthings better; we are not--what is the English?--hag-ridden?\"\n\nThere was a sort of murmur among the men, but the women all nodded as if\nthey thought Europe was entirely right. They'd have agreed with him if\nhe'd advocated sixteen wives sitting cross-legged on a mat, like the\nTurks. Mr. Pierce was still staring at the prince.\n\n\"What I don't quite understand, Mr. von Inwald,\" the bishop put in in\nhis nice way, \"is your custom of expecting a girl to bring her husband\na certain definite sum of money and to place it under the husband's\ncontrol. Our wealthy American girls control their own money,\" He was\nthinking of Miss Patty, and everybody knew it.\n\nThe prince turned red and glared at the bishop. Then I think he\nremembered that they didn't know who he was, and he smiled and started\nto turning the glass again.\n\n\"Pardon!\" he said. \"Is it not better? What do women know of money? They\nthrow it away on trifles, dress, jewels--American women are extravagant.\nIt is one result of their--of their spoiling.\"\n\nMr. Pierce got up and emptied his pipe into the fire. Then he turned.\n\n\"I'm afraid you have not known the best type of American women,\" he\nsaid, looking hard at the prince. \"Our representative women are our\nmiddle-class women. They do not contract European alliances, not having\nsufficient money to attract the attention of the nobility, or enough to\nbuy titles, as they do pearls, for the purpose of adornment.\"\n\nMr. von Inwald got up, and his face was red. Mr. Pierce was white and\nsneering.\n\n\"Also,\" he went on, \"when they marry they wish to control their own\nmoney, and not see it spent in--ways with which you are doubtless\nfamiliar.\"\n\nWe were all paralyzed. Nobody moved. Mr. Pierce put his pipe in his\npocket and stalked out, slamming the door. Then Mr. von Inwald shrugged\nhis shoulders and laughed.\n\n\"I see I shall have to talk to our young friend,\" he said and picked\nup his glass. \"I'm afraid I've given a wrong impression. I like the\nAmerican women very much; too well,\" he went on with a flash of his\nteeth, looking around the room, and brought the glass to the spring for\nme to fill. But as I've said before, I can tell a good bit about a man\nfrom the way he gives me his glass, and he was in a perfect frenzy of\nrage. When I reached it back to him he gripped it until his nails were\nwhite.\n\nMy joint ached all the rest of the afternoon. About five o'clock Mr.\nThoburn stopped in long enough to say: \"What's this I hear about Carter\nmaking an ass of himself to-day?\"\n\n\"I haven't heard it,\" I answered. \"What is it?\"\n\nBut he only laughed and turned up his collar to go.\n\n\"Jove, Minnie,\" he said, \"why do women of your spirit always champion\nthe losing side? Be a good girl; give me a hand now and then with this\nthing, and I'll see you don't lose by it.\"\n\n\"We're not going to lose,\" I retorted angrily. \"Nobody has left yet. We\nare still ahead on the books.\"\n\nHe came over and shook a finger in my face.\n\n\"Nobody has left--and why? Because they're all taking a series of baths.\nWait until they've had their fifteen, or twenty-one, or whatever the\ncure is, and then see them run!\"\n\nIt was true enough; I knew it.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE PRINCE, WITH APOLOGIES\n\nTillie brought the supper basket for the shelter-house about six o'clock\nand sat down for a minute by the fire. She said Mr. Pierce (Carter to\nher) had started out with a gun about five o'clock. It was foolish, but\nit made me uneasy.\n\n\"They've gone plumb crazy over that Mr. von Inwald,\" she declared. \"It\nmakes me tired. How do they know he's anything but what he says he is?\nHe may be a messenger from the emperor of Austria, and he may be selling\nflannel chest protectors. Miss Cobb's all set up; she's talking about\ngetting up an entertainment and asking that Miss Summers to recite.\"\n\nShe got up, leaving the basket on the hearth.\n\n\"And say,\" she said, \"you ought to see that dog now. It's been soakin'\nin peroxide all day!\"\n\nShe went out with the peroxide, but a moment later she opened the door\nand stuck her head in, nodding toward the basket.\n\n\"Say,\" she said, \"the chef's getting fussy about the stuff I'm using in\nthe diet kitchen. You've got to cut it out soon, Minnie. If I was you\nI'd let him starve.\"\n\n\"What!\" I screeched, and grasped the rail of the spring.\n\n\"Let him starve!\" she repeated.\n\n\"Wha--what are you talking about?\" I demanded when I got my voice.\n\nShe winked at me from the doorway.\n\n\"Oh, I'm on all right, Minnie!\" she assured me, \"although heaven only\nknows where he puts it all! He's sagged in like a chair with broken\nsprings.\"\n\nI saw then that she thought I was feeding Senator Biggs on the sly, and\nI breathed again. But my nerves were nearly gone, and when just then I\nheard a shot from the direction of the deer park, even Tillie noticed\nhow pale I got.\n\n\"I don't know what's come over you, Minnie,\" she said. \"That's only Mr.\nCarter shooting rabbits. I saw him go out as I started down the path.\"\n\nI was still nervous when I put on my shawl and picked up the basket.\nBut there was a puddle on the floor and the soup had spilled. There\nwas nothing for it but to go back for more soup, and I got it from the\nkitchen without the chef seeing me. When I opened the spring-house door\nagain Mr. Pierce was by the fire, and in front of him, where I'd left\nthe basket, lay a dead rabbit. He was sitting there with his chin in his\nhands looking at the poor thing, and there was no basket in sight.\n\n\"Well,\" I asked, \"did you change my basket into a dead rabbit?\"\n\n\"Basket!\" he said, looking up. \"What basket?\"\n\nI looked everywhere, but the basket was gone, and after a while I\ndecided that Mr. Dick had had an attack of thoughtfulness (or hunger)\nand had carried it out himself.\n\nAnd all the time I looked for the basket Mr. Pierce sat with the gun\nacross his knees and stared at the rabbit.\n\n\"I'd thank you to take that messy thing out of here,\" I told him.\n\n\"Poor little chap!\" he exclaimed. \"He was playing in the snow, and\nI killed him--not because I wanted food or sport, Minnie, but--well,\nbecause I had to kill something.\"\n\n\"I hope you don't have those attacks often,\" I said. He looked at the\nrabbit and sighed.\n\n\"Never in my life!\" he answered. \"For food or sport, that's different,\nbut--blood-lust!\" He got up and put the gun in the corner, and I saw he\nlooked white and miserable.\n\n\"I don't like myself to-night, Minnie,\" he said, trying to smile, \"and\nnobody likes me. I'm going into the garden to eat worms!\"\n\nI didn't like to scold him when he was feeling bad anyhow, but business\nis business. So I asked him how long he thought people would stay if he\nacted as he had that day. I said that a sanatorium was a place where\nthe man who runs it can't afford to have likes and dislikes; that for my\npart I'd a good deal rather he'd get rid of his excitement by shooting\noff a gun, provided he pointed it away from the house, than to sit\naround and let his mind explode and kill all our prospects. I told him,\ntoo, to remember that he wasn't responsible for the morals or actions of\nhis guests, only for their health.\n\n\"Health!\" he echoed, and kicked a chair. \"Health! Why, if I wanted to\nkeep a good dog in condition, Minnie, I wouldn't bring him here.\"\n\n\"No,\" I retorted, \"you'd shut him in an old out oven, and give him a\nshoe to chew, and he'd come out in three days frisking and happy. But\nyou can't do that with people.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" he asked. \"Although, of course, the supply of out ovens and\nold shoes is limited here.\"\n\n\"As far as Mr. von Inwald goes,\" I went on, \"that's not your affair or\nmine. If Miss Patty's own father can't prevent it, why should you worry\nabout it?\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" he agreed. \"Why should I? But I do, Minnie--that's the\ndevil of it.\"\n\n\"There are plenty of nice girls,\" I suggested, feeling rather sorry for\nhim.\n\n\"Are there? Oh, I dare say.\" He stooped and picked up his rabbit.\n\"Straight through the head; not so bad for twilight. Poor little chap!\"\n\nHe said good night and went out, taking the gun and the rabbit with him,\nand I went into the pantry to finish straightening things for the night.\nIn a few minutes I heard voices in the other room, one Mr. Pierce's, and\none with a strong German accent.\n\n\"When was that?\" Mr. von Inwald's voice.\n\n\"A year ago, in Vienna.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"At the Bal Tabarin. You were in a loge. The man I was with told me who\nthe woman was. It was she, I think, who suggested that you lean over the\nrail--\"\n\n\"Ah, so!\" said Mr. von Inwald as if he just remembered. \"Ah, yes, I\nrecall--I was with--the lady was red-haired, is it not? And it was she\nwho desired me--\"\n\n\"You leaned over the rail and poured a glass of wine on my head. It was\nvery funny. The lady was charmed.\"\n\n\"I recall it perfectly. I remember that I did it under protest--it was a\nvery fine wine, and expensive.\"\n\n\"Then you also recall,\" said Mr. Pierce, very quietly, \"that because\nyou were with a--well, because you were with a woman, I could not return\nyour compliment. But I demanded the privilege at some future date when\nyou were alone.\"\n\n\"It is a pity,\" replied Mr. von Inwald, \"that now, when I am alone,\nthere is no wine!\"\n\n\"No, there is no wine,\" Mr. Pierce agreed slowly, \"but there is--\"\n\nI opened the door at that, and both of them started. Mr. von Inwald was\nstanding with his arms folded, and Mr. Pierce had one arm raised holding\nup a glass of spring water. In another second it would have been in the\nother man's face.\n\nI walked over to Mr. Pierce and took the glass out of his hand, and his\nexpression was funny to see.\n\n\"I've been looking everywhere for that glass,\" I said. \"It's got to be\nwashed.\"\n\nMr. von Inwald laughed and picked up his soft hat from the table.\n\nHe turned around at the door and looked back at Mr. Pierce, still\nlaughing.\n\n\"Accept my apologies!\" he said. \"It was such a fine wine, and so\nexpensive.\"\n\nThen he went out.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nSTOP, THIEF!\n\nI was pretty nervous when I took charge of the news stand that evening.\nAmanda King had an appointment with the dentist and had left everything\ntopsyturvey. I was still straightening up when people began to come down\nto dinner.\n\nMiss Cobb walked over to the news stand, and she'd cut the white yoke\nout of her purple silk. She looked very dressy, although somewhat thin.\n\n\"Everybody has dressed for dinner to-night, Minnie,\" she informed me.\n\"We didn't want Mr. von Inwald to have a wrong idea of American society,\nespecially after Mr. Carter's ridiculous conduct this afternoon, and\nI wonder if you'll be sweet enough to start the phonograph in the\norchestra gallery as we go in--something with dignity, you know--the\nwedding march, or the overture from Aida.\"\n\n\"Aida's cracked,\" I said shortly, \"and as far as I'm concerned, Mr.\nvon Inwald can walk in to his meals without music, or starve to death\nwaiting for the band.\"\n\nBut she got the phonograph, anyhow, and put the elevator boy in the\ngallery with it. She picked out some things by Caruso and Tetrazzini\nand piled them on a chair, but James had things to himself up there, and\nplayed The Spring Chicken through three times during dinner, with Miss\nCobb glaring at the gallery until the back of her neck ached, and the\ndining-room girls waltzing in with the dishes and polka-ing out.\n\nMr. Moody came out when dinner was over in a fearful rage and made for\nthe news stand.\n\n\"One of your ideas, I suppose,\" he asserted. \"What sort of a night am\nI going to have after chewing my food to rag-time, with my jaws doing a\nskirt-dance? Why in heaven's name couldn't you have had something slow,\nlike Handel's Largo, if you've got to have music?\"\n\nBut dinner was over fifteen minutes sooner than usual. James cake-walked\neverybody out to My Ann Elizer, and Miss Cobb was mortified to death.\n\nTwo or three things happened that night. For one, I got a good look at\nMiss Julia Summers. She was light-haired and well-fleshed, with an ugly\nface but a pleasant smile. She wore a low-necked dress that made Miss\nCobb's with the yoke out look like a storm collar, and if she had a\nbroken heart she didn't show it.\n\n\"Hello,\" she cried, looking at my hair, \"are you selling tobacco here or\nare you the cigar-lighter?\"\n\n\"Neither,\" I answered, looking over her head. \"I am employed as the\nextinguisher of gay guests.\"\n\n\"Good,\" she said, smiling. \"I'm something fine at that myself. Suppose\nI stay here and help. If I watch that line of knitting women I'll be\ncrotcheting Arabella's wool in my sleep to-night.\"\n\nWell, she was too cheerful to be angry with. So she stayed around for a\nwhile, and it was amazing how much tobacco I sold that evening. Men who\nusually bought tobies bought the best cigars, and when Mr. Jennings came\nup, scowling, and I handed him the brand he'd smoked for years, she took\none, clipped the end of it as neat as a finger nail and gave it to him,\nholding up the lighter.\n\n\"I'm not going to smoke yet, young woman,\" he said, glaring at her. But\nshe only smiled.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"I've been waiting hungrily until some\ndiscriminating smoker would buy one of those and light it. I love the\naroma.\"\n\nAnd he stood there for thirty minutes, standing mostly on one foot on\naccount of the gouty one, puffing like a locomotive, with her sniffing\nat the aroma and telling him how lonely she felt with no friends around\nand just recovering from a severe illness.\n\nAt eight o'clock he had Mrs. Hutchins bring him his fur-lined coat and\nhe and Miss Julia took Arabella, the dog, for a walk on the veranda!\n\nThe rest of the evening was quiet, and I needed it. Miss Patty and Mr.\nvon Inwald talked by the fire and I think he told her something--not\nall--of the scene in the spring-house. For she passed Mr. Pierce at the\nfoot of the stairs on her way up for the night and she pretended not to\nsee him. He stood there looking up after her with his mouth set, and at\nthe turn she glanced down and caught his eye. I thought she flushed,\nbut I wasn't sure, and at that minute Senator Biggs bought three\ntwenty-five-cent cigars and told me to keep the change from a dollar.\nI was so surprised at the alteration in him that I forgot Miss Patty\nentirely.\n\nAbout twelve o'clock, just after I went to my room, somebody knocked at\nthe door. When I opened, the new doctor was standing in the hall.\n\n\"I'm sorry to disturb you,\" he said, \"but nobody seems to know where the\npharmacy clerk is and I'll have to get some medicine.\"\n\n\"If I'd had my way, we'd have had a bell on that pharmacy clerk long\nago,\" I snapped, getting my keys. \"Who's sick?\"\n\n\"The big man,\" he replied. \"Biggs is his name, I think, a senator or\nsomething.\"\n\nI was leading the way to the stairs, but I stopped. \"I might have known\nit,\" I said. \"He hasn't been natural all evening. What's the matter with\nhim? Too much fast?\"\n\n\"Fast!\" He laughed. \"Too much feast! He's got as pretty a case of\nindigestion as I've seen for some time. He's giving a demonstration\nthat's almost theatrical.\"\n\nWell, he insisted it was indigestion, although I argued that it wasn't\npossible, and he wanted ipecac.\n\n\"I haven't seen a pharmacopoeia for so long that I wouldn't know one if\nI met it,\" he declared, \"but I've got a system of mnemonics that never\nfails. Ipecac and colic both end with 'c'--I'll never forget that\nconjunction. It was pounded in and poured in in my early youth.\"\n\nWell, the pharmacy was locked, and we couldn't find a key to fit it. And\nwhen I suggested mustard and warm water he jumped at the idea.\n\n\"Fine!\" he said. \"Better let me dish out the spring-water and you take\nmy job! Lead on, MacDuff, to the kitchen.\"\n\nAlthough it was only midnight there was not a soul about. A hall leads\nback of the office to the kitchen and pantries, and there was a low\nlight there, but the rest was dark. We bumped through the diet kitchen\nand into the scullery, when we found we had no matches. I went back for\nsome, and when I got as far as the diet kitchen again Doctor Barnes was\nthere, just inside the door.\n\n\"Sh!\" he whispered. \"Come into the scullery. The kitchen is dark, but\nthere is somebody in there, fumbling around, striking matches. I suppose\nyou don't have such things as burglars in this neck of the woods?\"\n\nWell, somebody had broken into Timmons' candy store a week before and\nstolen a box of chewing-gum and a hundred post-cards, and I told him so\nin a whisper.\n\n\"Anyhow, it isn't the chef,\" I said. \"He's had a row with the bath man\nand is in bed with a cut hand and a black eye, and nobody else has any\nbusiness here.\"\n\nWe tiptoed into the scullery in the dark: just then somebody knocked\na kettle down in the kitchen and it hit the stove below with a crash.\nWhoever was there swore, and it was not Francois, who expresses his\nfeelings mostly in French. This was English.\n\nThere's a little window from the kitchen into the scullery as well as\na door. The window had a wooden slide and it was open an inch or so. We\ncouldn't see anything, but we could hear a man moving around. Once he\nstruck a match, but it went out and he said \"Damn!\" again, and began to\nfeel his way toward the scullery.\n\nDoctor Barnes happened to touch my hand and he patted it as if to tell\nme not to be frightened. Then he crept toward the scullery door and\nwaited there.\n\nIt swung open slowly, but he waited until it closed again and the man\nwas in the room. Then he yelled and jumped and there was the sound of\na fall. I could hardly strike the match--I was trembling so--but when I\ndid there was Mr. Dick lying flat on the floor and the doctor sitting on\nhim.\n\n\"Mister Dick!\" I gasped, and dropped the match.\n\n\"Something hit me!\" Mr. Dick said feebly, and when I had got a candle\nlighted and had explained to Doctor Barnes that it was a mistake, he\ngot off him and let him up. He was as bewildered as Mr. Dick and pretty\nnearly as mad.\n\nWe put him--Mr. Dick--in a chair and gave him a glass of water, and\nafter he had got his breath--the doctor being a heavy man--he said he\nwas trying to find something to eat.\n\n\"Confound it, Minnie,\" he exclaimed, \"we're starving! It seems to me\nthere are enough of you here at least to see that we are fed. Not a bite\nsince lunch!\"\n\n\"But I thought you had the basket,\" I explained. \"I left it at the\nspring-house, and when I went back it was gone.\"\n\n\"So that was it!\" he answered. And then he explained that just about the\ntime they expected their supper they saw a man carry a basket stealthily\nthrough the snow to the deer park. It was twilight, but they watched him\nfrom the window, and he put the basket through the barbed-wire fence and\nthen crawled after it. Just inside he sat down on a log and, opening\nthe basket, began to eat. He was still there when it got too dark to see\nhim.\n\n\"If that was our dinner,\" he finished savagely, \"I hope he choked to\ndeath over it.\"\n\nDoctor Barnes chuckled. \"He didn't,\" he said, \"but he's got the worst\ncase of indigestion in seven counties.\"\n\nWell, I got the mustard and water ready with Mr. Dick standing by hoping\nMr. Biggs would die before he got it, and then I filled a basket for the\nshelter-house. I put out the light and he took the basket and started\nout, but he came back in a hurry.\n\n\"There's somebody outside talking,\" he said. I went to the door with him\nand listened.\n\n\"The sooner the better,\" Mike was saying. \"I'm no good while I've got it\non my mind.\"\n\nAnd Mr. Thoburn: \"To-morrow is too soon: they're not in the mood yet.\nPerhaps the day after. I'll let you know.\"\n\nI didn't get to sleep until almost morning, and then it was to dream\nthat Mr. Pierce was shouting \"Hypocrites\" to all the people in the\nsanatorium and threatening to throw glasses of mustard and warm water at\nthem.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nA BUNCH OF LETTERS\n\nWhen people went down to breakfast the next morning they found a card\nhanging on the office door with a half dozen new rules on it, and when\nI went out to the spring-house the guests were having an indignation\nmeeting in the sun parlor, with the bishop in the chair, and Senator\nBiggs, so wobbly he could hardly stand, making a speech.\n\nI tried to see Mr. Pierce, but early as it was he had gone for a\nwalk, taking Arabella with him. So I called a conference at the\nshelter-house--Miss Patty, Mr. and Mrs. Van Alstyne, Mr. and Mrs. Dick,\nand myself. Mrs. Dick wasn't dressed, but she sat up on the edge of her\ncot in her dressing-gown, with her feet on the soap box, and yawned. As\nwe didn't have enough chairs, Miss Patty jerked the soap box away and\nmade me sit down. Mr. Dick was getting breakfast.\n\nWe were in a tight place and we knew it.\n\n\"He is making it as hard for us as he can,\" Mrs. Sam declared. \"The idea\nof having the card-room lights put out at midnight, and the breakfast\nroom closed at ten! Nobody gets up at that hour.\"\n\n\"He was to come here every evening for orders,\" said Mr. Dick, measuring\nground coffee with a tablespoon, as I had showed him. \"He came just\nonce, and as for orders--well, he gave 'em to me!\"\n\nBut Miss Patty was always fair.\n\n\"I loathe him,\" she asserted. \"I want to quarrel with him the minute I\nsee him. He--he is presumptuous to the point of impertinence--but he's\nhonest: he thinks we're all hypocrites--those that are well and those\nthat are sick or think they are--and he hates hypocrisy.\"\n\nEverybody talked at once, then, and she listened.\n\n\"Very well,\" she said. \"I'll amend it. We're not all hypocrites. My\nmotives in all this are perfectly clear--and selfish.\"\n\n\"You and old Pierce would make a fine team, Pat,\" Mrs. Dick remarked\nwith a yawn. \"I like hypocrites myself. They're so comfy. But if you're\nnot above advice, Pat, you'll have Aunt Honoria break her neck or\nsomething--anything to get father back to town. Something is going to\nexplode, and Oskar doesn't like to be agitated.\"\n\nShe curled up on the cot with that and went sound asleep. The rest of us\nhad coffee and talked, but there wasn't anything to do. As Mr. Sam said,\nMr. Pierce didn't want to stay, anyhow, and as likely as not if we went\nto him in a body and told him he must come to the shelter-house for\ninstructions, and be suave and gentle when he was called down by the\nguests about the steam-pipes making a racket, he'd probably prefer to go\ndown to the village and take Doctor Barnes' place washing dishes at the\nstation. That wouldn't call for any particular mildness.\n\nBut he settled it by appearing himself. He came across the snow from the\ndirection of Mount Hope, and he had a pair of skees over his shoulder.\n(At that time I didn't even know the name of the things, but I learned\nenough about them later.) I must say he looked very well beside Mr.\nDick, who wasn't very large, anyhow, and who hadn't had time to put on\nhis collar, and Mr. Sam, who's always thin and sallow and never takes a\nstep he doesn't have to.\n\nI let him in, and when he saw us all there he started and hesitated.\n\n\"Come in, Pierce,\" Mr. Sam said. \"We've just been talking about you.\"\n\nHe came in, but he didn't look very comfortable.\n\n\"What have you decided to do with me?\" he asked. \"Put me under\nrestraint?\"\n\nHe was unbuttoning his sweater, and now he took out two of the smallest\nrabbits I ever saw and held them up by the ears. Miss Patty gave a\nlittle cry and took them, cuddling them in her lap.\n\n\"They're starving and almost frozen, poor little devils,\" he said. \"I\nfound them near where I shot the mother last night, Minnie, and by way\nof atonement I'm going to adopt them.\"\n\nWell, although the minute before they'd all been wishing they'd never\nseen him, they pretty nearly ate him up. Miss Patty held the rabbits, so\nwe all had turns at feeding them warm milk with a teaspoon and patting\ntheir pink noses. When it came Mr. Pierce's turn they were about full\nup, so he curled his big body on the floor at Miss Patty's feet and\ntalked to the rabbits and looked at her. He had one of those faces\nthat's got every emotion marked on it as clear as a barometer--when he\nwas mad his face was mad all over, and when he was pleased he glowed to\nthe tips of his ears. And he was pleased that morning.\n\nBut, of course, he had to be set right about the sanatorium, and Mr. Sam\nbegan it. Mr. Pierce listened, sitting on the floor and looking puzzled\nand more and more unhappy. Finally he got up and drew a long breath.\n\n\"Exactly,\" he agreed. \"I know you are all right and I'm wrong--according\nto your way of thinking. But if these people want to be well, why should\nI encourage them to do the wrong thing? They eat too much, they don't\nexercise\"--he turned to Mr. Van Alstyne.\n\n\"Why, do you know, I asked a half dozen of the men--one after the\nother--to go skeeing with me this morning and not one of them accepted!\"\n\n\"Really!\" Mr. Sam exclaimed mockingly.\n\n\"What can you do with people like that?\" Mr. Pierce went on. \"They don't\nwant to be well; they're all hypocrites. Look at that man Biggs! I'll\nlay you ten to one that after fasting five days and then stealing a\nwhole chicken, a dozen oysters and Lord knows what else, now that he's\nsick, he'll hold it against me.\"\n\n\"He's not holding anything,\" I objected.\n\n\"Because HE is a hypocrite--\" Mr. Sam began.\n\n\"That's not the point, Pierce,\" Mr. Dick broke in importantly. \"You were\nto come here for orders and you haven't done it. You're running this\nplace for me, not for yourself.\"\n\nMr. Pierce looked at Mr. Dick and from there to Mr. Sam and smiled.\n\n\"I did come,\" he explained. \"I came twice, and each time we played\nroulette. I lost all the money I'd had in advance. Honestly,\" he\nconfessed, \"I felt I couldn't afford to come every day.\"\n\nMiss Patty got up and put the baby rabbits into her sister's big fur\nmuff.\n\n\"We are all talking around the question,\" she said. \"Mr. Pierce\nundertook to manage the sanatorium, and to try to manage it\nsuccessfully. He can not do that without making some attempt at\nconciliating the people. It's--it's absurd to antagonize them.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" he said coldly. \"I was to manage it, and to try to do it\nsuccessfully. I'm sorry my methods don't meet with the approval of\nthis--er--executive committee. But it might as well be clear that I\nintend to use my own methods--or none.\"\n\nWell, what could we do? Miss Patty went out with her head up, and the\nrest of us stayed and ate humble pie, and after a while he agreed to\nstay if he wasn't interfered with. He said he and Doctor Barnes had a\nplan that he thought was a winner--that it would either make or break\nthe place, and he thought it would make it. And by that time we were so\nmeek that we didn't even ask what it was.\n\nDoctor Barnes and Miss Summers were the first to come to the mineral\nspring that morning. She stopped just inside the door and sniffed.\n\n\"Something's dead under the floor,\" she said.\n\n\"If there's anything dead,\" Doctor Barnes replied, \"it's in the center\nof the earth. That's the sulphur water.\"\n\nShe came in at that, but unwillingly, and sat down with her handkerchief\nto her nose. Then she saw me.\n\n\"Good gracious!\" she exclaimed. \"What have you done that they put you\nhere?\"\n\n\"If you mean the bouquet from the spring, you get to like it after a\nwhile,\" I said grimly. \"Ordinary air hasn't got any snap for me now.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" She looked at me suspiciously, but I was busy wiping off the\ntables. \"Well,\" she said, holding up the glass Doctor Barnes had brought\nher, \"it doesn't cost me anything, so here goes. But think of paying\nmoney for it!\"\n\nShe drank it down in a gulp and settled herself in her chair.\n\n\"What'll it do to me?\" she asked. \"Mixed drinks always play the deuce\nwith me, Barnes, and you know it.\"\n\n\"If you'll cut down your diet and take some exercise it will make you\nthin,\" I began. \"'The process is painless and certain: kindly nature in\nher benevolent plan--'\"\n\n\"Give me another!\" she interrupted, and Doctor Barnes filled her glass\nagain. \"Some women spell fate f-a-t-e,\" she said, looking at the water,\n\"but I spell it without the e.\"\n\nShe took half of it and then put down the glass. \"Honestly,\" she\ndeclared, \"I'd rather be fat.\"\n\nMr. Pierce met them there a few minutes later and they had a\nthree-cornered chat. But Miss Summers evidently didn't know just how\nmuch I knew and was careful of what she said. Once, however, when I was\nin the pantry she thought I was beyond ear-shot.\n\n\"Good heavens, Pierce,\" she said, \"if they could put THAT in a play!\"\n\n\"Cut it out, Julia,\" Doctor Barnes snapped, and it wasn't until they had\ngone that I knew she'd meant me. I looked through the crack of the door\nand she was leaning over taking a puff at Doctor Barnes' cigarette.\n\n\"Curious old world, isn't it?\" she said between puffs. \"Here we are the\nthree of us--snug and nice, having seven kinds of hell-fire water and\nnot having to pay for it; three meals a day and afternoon tea ditto,\ngood beds and steam-heat ditto--and four days ago where were we? Pierce,\nyou were hocking your clothes! Doc, you--\"\n\n\"Washing dishes!\" he said. \"I never knew before how extravagant it is to\nhave a saucer under a cup!\"\n\n\"And I!\" she went on, \"I, Julia Summers, was staring at a ceiling in the\nFinleyville hotel, with a face that looked like a toy balloon.\"\n\n\"And now,\" said Doctor Barnes, \"you are more beautiful than ever. I am a\nsuccessful physician--oh, lord, Julia, if you'd hear me faking lines in\nmy part! And my young friend here--Pierce--Julia, Pierce has now become\na young reprobate named Dicky Carter, and may the Lord have mercy on his\nsoul!\"\n\nI tried to get out in time, but I was too late. I saw her rise, saw the\nglass of water at her elbow roll over and smash on the floor, and saw\nher clutch wildly at Mr. Pierce's shoulder.\n\n\"Not--not DICKY Carter!\" she cried.\n\n\"Richard--they call him Dick,\" Mr. Pierce said uneasily, and loosened\nher fingers from his coat.\n\nOh, well, everybody knows it now--how she called Mr. Dick everything in\nthe calendar, and then began to cry and said nobody would ever know what\nshe'd been through with, and the very dress she had on was a part of\nthe trousseau she'd had made, and what with the dressmaker's bills--\n\nSuddenly she stopped crying.\n\n\"Where is he, anyhow?\" she demanded.\n\n\"All we are sure of,\" Mr. Pierce replied quietly, \"is that he is not in\nthe sanatorium.\"\n\nShe looked at us all closely, but she got nothing from my face.\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" she said, shrugging her shoulders, \"I'll wait until he\nshows up. It doesn't cost anything.\"\n\nThen, with one of her easy changes, she laughed and picked up her muff\nto go.\n\n\"Minnie and I,\" she said, \"will tend bar here, and in our leisure\nmoments we will pour sulphur water on a bunch of Dicky's letters that I\nhave, to cool 'em.\" She walked to the door and turned around, smiling.\n\n\"Carry fire insurance on 'em all the time,\" she finished and went out,\nleaving us staring at one another!\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nMISS COBB'S BURGLAR\n\nI went to bed early that night. What with worrying and being alternately\nchilled by tramping through the snow and roasted as if I was sitting on\na volcano with an eruption due, I was about all in. We'd been obliged to\ntell Mrs. Sam about the Summers woman, and I had to put hot flannels on\nher from nine to ten. She was quieter when I left her, but, as I told\nMr. Sam, it was the stillness of despair, not resignation.\n\nI guess it was about four o'clock in the morning when a hand slid over\nmy face, and I sat up and yelled. The hand covered my mouth at that,\nand something long and white and very thin beside the bed said: \"Sh! For\nheaven's sake, Minnie!\"\n\nIt was Miss Cobb! It was lucky I came to my senses when I did, for\nher knees gave way under her just then and she doubled up on the floor\nbeside the bed with her face in my comfort.\n\nI lighted a candle and set it on a chair beside the bed and took a good\nlook at her. She was shaking all over, which wasn't strange, for I sleep\nwith my window open, and she had a key in her hand.\n\n\"Here,\" she gasped, holding out the key, \"here, Minnie, wake the house\nand get him, but, oh, Minnie, for heaven's sake, save my reputation!\"\n\n\"Get who?\" I demanded, for I saw it was her room key.\n\n\"I have been coming here for ten years,\" she groaned, out of the\ncomfort, \"and now, to be bandied about by the cold breath of scandal!\"\n\nI shook her by the shoulder\n\n\"The cold breath you are raving about is four degrees below zero. If you\ncan't tell me what's the matter I'm going back to bed and cover my\nfeet.\"\n\nShe got up at that and stood swaying, with her nightgown flapping around\nher like a tent.\n\n\"I have locked a man in my room!\" she declared in a terrible voice, and\ncollapsed into the middle of the bed.\n\nWell, I leaned over and tried to tell her she'd made a mistake. The more\nI looked at her, with her hair standing straight out over her head, and\nher cambric nightgown with a high collar and long sleeves, and the hump\non her nose where her brother Willie had hit her in childhood with a\nbaseball bat, the surer I was that somebody had made a mistake--likely\nthe man.\n\nNow there's two ways to handle a situation like that: one of them is to\nrouse the house--and many a good sanatorium has been hurt by a scandal\nand killed by a divorce; the other way is to take one strong man who can\nhold his tongue, find the guilty person, and send him a fake telegram\nthe next morning that his mother is sick. I've done that more than once.\n\nI sat down on the side of the bed and put on my slippers.\n\n\"What did he look like?\" I asked. \"Could you see him?\"\n\nShe uncovered one eye.\n\n\"Not--not distinctly,\" she said. \"I--think he was large, and--and rather\nhandsome. That beast of a dog must have got in my room and was asleep\nunder the bed, for it wakened me by snarling.\"\n\nThere was nothing in that to make me nervous, but it did. As I put on my\nkimono I was thinking pretty hard.\n\nI could not waken Mr. Pierce by knocking, so I went in and shook him.\nHe was sound asleep, with his arms over his head, and when I caught his\nshoulder he just took my hand and, turning over, tucked it under his\ncheek and went asleep again.\n\n\"Mr. Pierce! Mr. Pierce!\" He wakened a little at that, but not enough\nto open his eyes. He seemed to know that the hand wasn't his, however,\nfor he kissed it. And with that I slapped him and he wakened. He lay\nthere blinking at my candle and then he yawned.\n\n\"Musht have been ashleep!\" he said, and turned over on his other side\nand shut his eyes.\n\nIt was two or three minutes at least before I had him sitting on the\nside of the bed, with a blanket spread over his knees, and was telling\nhim about Miss Cobb.\n\n\"Miss Cobb!\" he said. \"Oh, heavens, Minnie, tell her to go back to bed!\"\nHe yawned. \"If there's anybody there it's a mistake. I'm sleepy. What\ntime is it?\"\n\n\"I'm not going out of this room until you get up!\" I declared grimly.\n\n\"Oh, very well!\" he said, and put his feet back into bed. \"If you think\nI'm going to get up while you're here--\"\n\nAfter he seemed pretty well wakened I went out. I waited in the\nsitting-room and I heard him growling as he put on his clothes. When he\ncame out, however, he was more cheerful, and he stopped in the hall to\nfish a case out of Mr. Sam's dressing-gown pocket and light a cigarette.\n\n\"Now!\" he said, taking my arm. \"Forward, the light-ly clad brigade!\nBut--\" he stopped--\"Minnie, we are unarmed! Shall I get the patent\nfolding corkscrew?\"\n\nHe had to be quiet when we got to the bedroom floors, however, and when\nwe stopped outside Miss Cobb's door he was as sober as any one could\nwish him.\n\n\"You needn't come in,\" he whispered. \"Ten to one she dreamed it, but if\nshe didn't you're better outside. And whatever you hear, don't yell.\"\n\nI gave him the key and he fitted it quietly in the lock. Arabella, just\ninside, must have heard, for she snarled. But the snarl turned into a\nyelp, as if she'd been suddenly kicked.\n\nMr. Pierce, with his hand on the knob, turned and looked at me in the\ncandle-light. Then he opened the door.\n\nArabella gave another yelp and rushed out; she went between my feet\nlike a shot and almost overthrew me, and when I'd got my balance again I\nlooked into the room. Mr. Pierce was at the window, staring out, and the\nroom was empty.\n\n\"The idiot!\" Mr. Pierce said. \"If it hadn't been for that snowbank!\nHere, give me that candle!\"\n\nHe stood there waving it in circles, but there was neither sight nor\nsound from below. After a minute Mr. Pierce put the window down and we\nstared at the room. All the bureau drawers were out on the floor, and\nthe lid of poor Miss Cobb's trunk was open and the tray upset. But her\nsilver-backed brush was still on the bureau and the ring the insurance\nagent had given her lay beside it.\n\nWe brought her back to her room, and she didn't know whether to be happy\nthat she was vindicated or mad at the state her things were in. I tucked\nher up in bed after she'd gone over her belongings and Mr. Pierce had\ndouble-locked the window and gone out. She drew my head down to her and\nher eyes were fairly popping out of her head.\n\n\"I feel as though I'm going crazy, Minnie!\" she whispered, \"but the only\nthings that are gone are my letters from Mr. Jones, and--my black woolen\ntights!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nNO MARRIAGE IN HEAVEN\n\nI slept late the next morning, and when I'd had breakfast and waded to\nthe spring-house it was nearly nine. It was still snowing, and no papers\nor mail had got through, although the wires were still in fair working\norder.\n\nAs I floundered out I thought I saw somebody slink around the corner of\nthe spring-house, but when I got there nobody was in sight. I was on my\nknees in front of the fireplace, raking out the fire, when I heard the\ndoor close behind me, and when I turned, there stood Mr. Dick, muffled\nto the neck, with his hat almost over his face.\n\n\"What the deuce kept you so late this morning?\" he demanded, in a sulky\nvoice, and limping over to a table he drew a package out of his pocket\nand slammed it on the table.\n\n\"I was up half the night, as usual,\" I said, rising. \"You oughtn't to be\nhere, Mr. Dick!\"\n\nHe caught hold of the rail around the spring, and hobbling about,\ndropped into a chair with a groan.\n\n\"For two cents,\" he declared, \"I'd chop a hole in the ice pond and drown\nmyself. There's no marriage in Heaven.\"\n\n\"That's no argument for the other place,\" I answered, and stopped,\nstaring. He was pulling something out of his overcoat pocket, an inch at\na time.\n\n\"For God's sake, Minnie,\" he exclaimed, \"return this--this garment\nto--whomever it belongs to!\"\n\nHe handed it to me, and it was Miss Cobb's black tights! I stood and\nstared.\n\n\"And then,\" he went on, reaching for the package on the table, \"when\nyou've done that, return to 'Binkie' these letters from her Jonesie.\"\n\nHe took the newspaper off the bundle then, and I saw it was wrapped with\na lavender ribbon. I sat down and gazed at him, fascinated. He was the\nsaddest-eyed piece of remorse I'd seen for a long time.\n\n\"And when you've got your breath back, Minnie,\" he said feebly, \"and\nyour strength, would you mind taking the floor mop and hitting me a\nfew cracks? Only not on the right leg, Minnie--not on the right leg. I\nlanded on it last night; it's twisted like a pretzel.\"\n\n\"Don't stand and stare,\" he continued irritably, when I didn't make\na move, \"at least get that--that infernal black garment out of sight.\nCover it with the newspaper. And if you don't believe that a sweet-faced\nyoung girl like my wife has a positive talent for wickedness and\nsuspicion, go out to the shelter-house this morning.\"\n\n\"So it was you!\" I gasped, putting the newspaper over the tights.\n\n\"Why in the name of peace did you jump out the window, and what did you\nwant with--with these things?\"\n\nHe twisted around in his chair to stare at me, and then stooped and\nclutched frantically at his leg, as if for inspiration.\n\n\"Want with those things!\" he snarled. \"I suppose you can't understand\nthat a man might wake up in the middle of the night with a mad craving\nfor a pair of black woolen tights, and--\"\n\n\"You needn't be sarcastic with me,\" I broke in. \"You can save that for\nyour wife. I suppose you also had a wild longing for the love-letters of\nan insurance agent--\"\n\nAnd then it dawned on me, and I sat down and laughed until I cried.\n\n\"And you thought you were stealing your own letters!\" I cried. \"The ones\nshe carries fire insurance on! Oh, Mr. Dick, Mr. Dick!\"\n\n\"How was I to know it wasn't Ju--Miss Summers' room?\" he demanded\nangrily. \"Didn't I follow the dratted dog? And wouldn't you have thought\nthe wretched beast would have known me instead of sitting on its tail\nunder the bed and yelling for mother? I gave her the dog myself. Oh, I\ntell you, Minnie, if I ever get away from this place--\"\n\n\"You've got to get away this minute,\" I broke in, remembering. \"They'll\nbe coming any instant now.\"\n\nHe got up and looked around him helplessly.\n\n\"Where'll I go?\" he asked. \"I can't go back to the shelter-house.\"\n\nI looked at him and he tried to grin.\n\n\"Fact,\" he said, \"hard to believe, but--fact, Minnie. She's got the door\nlocked. Didn't I tell you she is of a suspicious nature? She was asleep\nwhen I left, and mostly she sleeps all night. And just because she wakes\nwhen I'm out, and lets me come in thinking she's asleep, when she\nhas one eye open all the time, and she sees what I'd never even seen\nmyself--that the string of that damned garment, whatever it is, is\nfastened to the hook of my shoe, me thinking all the time that the\nweight was because I'd broken my leg jumping--doesn't she suddenly\nsit up and ask me where I've been? And I--I'm unsuspicious, Minnie, by\nnature, and I said I'd been asleep. Then she jumped up and showed me\nthat--that thing--those things, hanging to my shoe, and she hasn't\nspoken to me since. I wish I was dead.\"\n\nAnd just then a dog barked outside and somebody on the step stamped the\nsnow off his feet. We were both paralyzed for a moment.\n\n\"Julia!\" Mr. Dick cried, and went white.\n\nI made a leap for the door, just as the handle turned, and put my back\nagainst it.\n\n\"Just a minute,\" I called. \"The carpet is caught under it!\"\n\nMr. Dick had lost his head and was making for the spring, as if he\nthought hiding his feet would conceal him. I made frantic gestures to\nhim to go into my pantry, and he went at last, leaving his hat on the\ntable, I left the door and flung it after him--the hat, of course, not\nthe door--and when Miss Summers sauntered in just after, I was on my\nknees brushing the hearth, with my heart going three-four time and\nskipping every sixth beat.\n\n\"Hello!\" she said. \"Lovely weather--for polar bears. If the natives\nwade through this all winter it's no wonder they walk as if they are\nham-strung. Don't bother getting me a glass. I'll get my own.\"\n\nShe was making for the pantry when I caught her, and I guess I looked\npretty wild.\n\n\"I'll get it,\" I said. \"I--that's one of the rules.\"\n\nShe put her hands in the pockets of her white sweater and smiled at me.\n\n\"Do you know,\" she declared, \"the old ladies' knitting society isn't\nso far wrong about you! About your making rules--whatever you want,\nWHENEVER you want 'em.\"\n\nShe put her head on one side.\n\n\"Now,\" she went on, \"suppose I break that rule and get my own glass?\nWhat happens to me? I don't think I'll be put out!\"\n\nI threw up my hands in despair, for I was about at the end of my string.\n\n\"Get it then!\" I exclaimed, and sat down, waiting for the volcano to\nerupt. But she only laughed and sat down on a table, swinging her feet.\n\n\"When you know me better, Minnie,\" she said, \"you'll know I don't spoil\nsport. I happen to know you have somebody in the pantry--moreover, I\nknow it's a man. There are tracks on the little porch, my dear girl,\nnot made by your galoshes. Also, my dearest girl, there's a gentleman's\nglove by your chair there!\" I put my foot on it. \"And just to show you\nwhat a good fellow I am--\"\n\nShe got off the table, still smiling, and sauntered to the pantry door,\nwatching me over her shoulder.\n\n\"Don't be alarmed!\" she called through the door, \"I'm not coming in! I\nshall take my little drink of nature's benevolent remedy out of the tin\nladle, and then--I shall take my departure!\"\n\nMy heart was skipping every second beat by that time, and Miss Julia\nstood by the pantry door, her head back and her eyes almost closed,\nenjoying every minute of it. If Arabella hadn't made a diversion just\nthen I think I'd have fainted.\n\nShe'd pulled the newspaper and the tights off the table and was running\naround the room with them, one leg in her mouth.\n\n\"Stop it, Arabella!\" said Miss Julia, and took the tights from her.\n\"Yours?\" she asked, with her eyebrows raised.\n\n\"No--yes,\" I answered.\n\n\"I'd never have suspected you of them!\" she remarked. \"Hardly sheer\nenough to pull through a finger ring, are they?\" She held them up and\ngazed at them meditatively. \"That's one thing I draw the line at. On\nthe boards, you know--never have worn 'em and never will. They're not\nmodest, to my mind,--and, anyhow, I'm too fat!\"\n\nMr. Sam and his wife came in at that moment, Mr. Sam carrying a bottle\nof wine for the shelter-house, wrapped in a paper, and two cans of\nsomething or other. He was too busy trying to make the bottle look like\nsomething else--which a good many people have tried and failed at--to\nnotice what Miss Summers was doing, and she had Miss Cobb's protectors\nstuffed in her muff and was standing very dignified in front of the fire\nby the time they'd shaken off the snow.\n\n\"Good morning!\" she said.\n\n\"Morning!\" said Mr. Sam, hanging up his overcoat with one hand, and\ntrying to put the bottle in one of the pockets with the other. Mrs. Sam\ndidn't look at her.\n\n\"Good morning, Mrs. Van Alstyne!\" Miss Summers almost threw it at her.\n\"I spoke to you before; I guess you didn't hear me.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I heard you,\" answered Mrs. Sam, and turned her back on her.\nGive me a little light-haired woman for sheer devilishness!\n\nI'd expected to see Miss Summers fly to pieces with rage, but she stared\nat Mrs. Sam's back, and after a minute she laughed.\n\n\"I see!\" she remarked slowly. \"You're the sister, aren't you?\"\n\nMr. Sam had given up trying to hide the bottle and now he set it on the\nfloor with a thump and came over to the fire.\n\n\"It's--you see, the situation is embarrassing,\" he began. \"If we had had\nany idea--\"\n\n\"I might have been still in the Finleyville hotel!\" she finished for\nhim. \"Awful thought, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Under the circumstances,\" went on Mr. Sam, nervously, \"don't you think\nit would be--er--better form if er--under the circumstances--\"\n\n\"I'm thinking of my circumstances,\" she put in, good-naturedly. \"If you\nimagine that six weeks of one-night stands has left me anything but a\nrural wardrobe and a box of dog biscuit for Arabella, you're pretty well\nmistaken. I haven't even a decent costume. All we had left after the\nsheriff got through was some grass mats, a checked sunbonnet and a\npump.\"\n\n\"Minnie,\" Mrs. Sam said coldly, \"that little beast of a dog is trying to\ndrink out of the spring!\"\n\nI caught her in time and gave her a good slapping. When I looked up Miss\nSummers was glaring down at me over the rail.\n\n\"Just what do you mean by hitting my dog?\" she demanded. It was the\nfirst time I'd seen her angry.\n\n\"Just what I appeared to mean,\" I answered. \"If you want to take it as a\nlove pat, you may.\" And I stalked to the door and threw the creature out\ninto the snow. It was the first false step that day; if I'd known what\nputting that dog out meant--! \"I don't allow dogs here,\" I said, and\nshut the door.\n\nMiss Summers was furious; she turned and stared at Mrs. Sam, who was\nsmiling at the fire.\n\n\"Let Arabella in,\" she said to me in an undertone, \"or I'll open the\npantry door!\"\n\n\"Open the door!\" I retorted. I was half hysterical, but it was no time\nto weaken. She looked me straight in the eye for fully ten seconds;\nthen, to my surprise, she winked at me. But when she turned on Mr. Sam\nshe was cold rage again and nothing else.\n\n\"I am not going to leave, if that is what you are about to suggest,\" she\nsaid. \"I've been trying to see Dicky Carter the last ten days, and I'll\nstay here until I see him.\"\n\n\"It's a delicate situation--\"\n\n\"Delicate!\" she snapped. \"It's indelicate it's indecent, that's what it\nis. Didn't I get my clothes, and weren't we to have been married by\nthe Reverend Dwight Johnstone, out in Salem, Ohio? And didn't he go out\nthere and have old Johnstone marry him to somebody else? The wretch! If\nI ever see him--\"\n\nA glass dropped in the pantry and smashed, but nobody paid any\nattention.\n\n\"Oh, I'm not going until he comes!\" she continued. \"I'll stay right\nhere, and I'll have what's coming to me or I'll know the reason why.\nDon't forget for a minute that I know why Mr. Pierce is here, and that I\ncan spoil the little game by calling the extra ace, if I want to.\"\n\n\"You're forgetting one thing,\" Mrs. Sam said, facing her for the first\ntime, \"if you call the game, my brother is worth exactly what clothes he\nhappens to be wearing at the moment and nothing else. He hasn't a penny\nof his own.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" she sniffed. \"Look at the things he gave me!\"\n\n\"Yes. I've already had the bills,\" said Mr. Sam.\n\nShe whirled and looked at him, and then she threw back her head and\nlaughed.\n\n\"You!\" she said. \"Why, bless my soul! All the expense of a double life\nand none of its advantages!\"\n\nShe went out on that, still laughing, leaving Mrs. Sam scarlet with\nrage, and when she was safely gone I brought Mr. Dick out to the fire.\nHe was so limp he could hardly walk, and it took three glasses of the\nwine and all Mr. Sam could do to start him back to the shelter-house.\nHis sister would not speak to him.\n\nMike went to Mr. Pierce that day and asked for a raise of salary.\n\nHe did not get it. Perhaps, as things have turned out, it was for the\nbest, but it is strange to think how different things would have been if\nhe'd been given it. He was sent up later, of course, for six months for\nmalicious mischief, but by that time the damage was done.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nEVERY DOG HAS HIS DAY\n\nThat was on a Saturday morning. During the golf season Saturday is\nalways a busy day with us, with the husbands coming up for over Sunday,\nand trying to get in all the golf, baths and spring water they can in\nforty-eight hours. But in the winter Saturday is the same as any, other\nday.\n\nIt had stopped snowing and the sun was shining, although it was so cold\nthat the snow blew like powder. By eleven o'clock every one who could\nwalk had come to the spring-house. Even Mr. Jennings came down in a\nwheeled chair, and Senator Biggs, still looking a sort of grass-green\nand keeping his eyes off me, came and sat in a corner, with a book\ncalled Fast versus Feast held so that every one could see.\n\nThere were bridge tables going, and five hundred, and a group around\nthe slot-machine, while the crocheters formed a crowd by themselves,\nexchanging gossip and new stitches.\n\nAbout twelve o'clock Mr. Thoburn came in, and as he opened the door,\nin leaped Arabella. The women made a fuss over the creature and cuddled\nher, and when I tried to put her out everybody objected. So she stayed,\nand Miss Summers put her through a lot of tricks, while the men crowded\naround. As I said before, Miss Summers was a first favorite with the\nmen.\n\nMr. von Inwald and Miss Patty came in just then and stood watching.\n\n\"And now,\" said Mr. von Inwald, \"I propose, as a reward to Miss\nArabella, a glass of this wonderful water. Minnie, a glass of water for\nArabella!\"\n\n\"She doesn't drink out of one of my glasses,\" I declared angrily.\n\n\"It's one of my rules that dogs--\"\n\n\"Tut!\" said Mr. Thoburn. \"What's good for man is good for beast.\nBesides, the little beggar's thirsty.\"\n\nWell, they made a great fuss about the creature's being thirsty, and so\nfinally I got a panful of spring water and it drank until I thought it\nwould burst. I'm not vicious, as I say, but I wish it had.\n\nWell, the dog finished and lay down by the fire, and everything seemed\nto go on as before. Mr. Thoburn was in a good humor, and he came over to\nthe spring and brought a trayful of glasses.\n\n\"To save you steps, Minnie!\" he explained. \"You have no idea how it\npains me to see you working. Gentlemen, name your poison!\"\n\n\"A frappe with blotting-paper on the side,\" Mr. Moody snarled from the\nslot-machine. \"If I drink much more, I'll have to be hooped up like a\nbarrel.\"\n\n\"Just what is the record here?\" the bishop asked. \"I'm ordered eight\nglasses, but I find it more than a sufficiency.\"\n\n\"We had one man here once who could drink twenty-five at a time,\" I\nsaid, \"but he was a German.\"\n\n\"He was a tank,\" Mr. Sam corrected grumpily. He was watching something\non the floor--I couldn't see what. \"All I need is to swallow a few\ngoldfish and I'd be a first-class aquarium.\"\n\n\"What I think we should do,\" Miss Cobb said, \"is to try to find out just\nwhat suits us, and stick to that. I'm always trying.\"\n\n\"Damned trying!\" Mr. Jennings snarled, and limped over for more water.\n\"I'd like to know where to go for rheumatism.\"\n\n\"I got mine here,\" said Mr. Thoburn cheerfully. \"It's my opinion this\nplace is rheumatic as well as malarious. And as for this water, with all\ndue respect to the spirit in the spring\"--he bowed to me--\"I think it's\nan insult to ask people to drink it. It isn't half so strong as it\nwas two years ago. Taste it; smell it! I ask the old friends of the\nsanatorium, is that water what it used to be?\"\n\n\"Don't tell me it was ever any worse than this!\" Miss Summers exclaimed.\nBut Thoburn went on. The card-players stopped to listen, but Mr. Sam was\nstill staring at something on the floor.\n\n\"I tell you, the spring is losing its virtue, and, like a woman, without\nvirtue, it is worthless.\"\n\n\"But interesting!\" Mr. Sam said, and stooped down.\n\n\"Consider,\" went on Mr. Thoburn, standing and holding his glass to the\nlight, \"how we are at the mercy of this little spring! A convulsion in\nthe bowels of the earth, and its health-giving properties may be changed\nto the direst poison. How do we know, you and I, some such change has\nnot occurred overnight? Unlikely as it is, it's a possibility that,\nsitting here calmly, we may be sipping our death potion.\"\n\nSome of the people actually put down their glasses and everybody began\nto look uneasy except Mr. Sam, who was still watching something I could\nnot see.\n\nMr. Thoburn looked around and saw he'd made an impression. \"We may,\"\nhe continued, \"although my personal opinion of this water is that it's\ngrowing too weak to be wicked. I prove my faith in Mother Nature; if it\nis poisoned, I am gone. I drink!\"\n\nMr. Sam suddenly straightened up and glanced at Miss Summers. \"Perhaps\nI'm mistaken,\" he said, \"but I think there is something the matter with\nArabella.\"\n\nEverybody looked: Arabella was lying on her back, jerking and twitching\nand foaming at the mouth.\n\n\"She's been poisoned!\" Miss Summers screeched, and fell on her knees\nbeside her. \"It's that wretched water!\"\n\nThere was pretty nearly a riot in a minute. Everybody jumped up and\nstared at the dog, and everybody remembered the water he or she had just\nhad, and coming on top of Mr. Thoburn's speech, it made them babbling\nlunatics. As I look back, I have a sort of picture of Miss Summers on\nthe floor with Arabella in her lap, and the rest telling how much of the\nwater they had had and crowding around Mr. Thoburn.\n\n\"It seems hardly likely it was the water,\" he said, \"although from what\nI recall of my chemistry it is distinctly possible. Springs have been\nknown to change their character, and the coincidence--the dog and the\nwater--is certainly startling. Still, as nobody feels ill--\"\n\nBut they weren't sure they didn't. The bishop said he felt perfectly\nwell, but he had a strange inclination to yawn all the time, and Mrs.\nBiggs' left arm had gone to sleep. And then, with the excitement and\nall, Miss Cobb took a violent pain in the back of her neck and didn't\nknow whether to cry or to laugh.\n\nWell, I did what I could. The worst of it was, I wasn't sure it wasn't\nthe water. I thought possibly Mr. Pierce had made a mistake in what he\nhad bought at the drug store, and although I don't as a rule drink it\nmyself, I began to feel queer in the pit of my stomach.\n\nMr. Thoburn came over to the spring, and filling a glass, took it to\nthe light, with every one watching anxiously. When he brought it back he\nstooped over the railing and whispered to me.\n\n\"When did you fix it?\" he asked sternly.\n\n\"Last night,\" I answered. It was no time to beat about the bush.\n\n\"It's yellower than usual,\" he said. \"I'm inclined to think something\nhas gone wrong at the drug store, Minnie.\"\n\nI could hardly breathe. I had the most terrible vision of all the guests\nlying around like Arabella, twitching and foaming, and me going to\nprison as a wholesale murderess. Any hair but mine would have turned\ngray in that minute.\n\nMr. von Inwald was watching like the others, and now he came over and\ncaught Mr. Thoburn by the arm.\n\n\"What do you think--\" he asked nervously. \"I--I have had three glasses\nof it!\"\n\n\"Three!\" shouted Senator Biggs, coming forward. \"I've had eleven! I tell\nyou, I've been feeling queer for twenty-four hours! I'm poisoned! That's\nwhat I am.\"\n\nHe staggered out, with Mrs. Biggs just behind him, and from that moment\nthey were all demoralized. I stood by the spring and sipped at the\nwater to show I wasn't afraid of it, with my knees shaking under me and\nArabella lying stock-still, as if she had died, under my very nose. One\nby one they left to look for Doctor Barnes, or to get the white of egg,\nwhich somebody had suggested as an antidote.\n\nMiss Cobb was one of the last to go. She turned in the doorway and\nlooked back at me, with tears in her eyes.\n\n\"It isn't your fault, Minnie,\" she said, \"and forgive me if I have ever\nsaid anything unkind to you.\" Then she went, and I was alone, looking\ndown at Arabella.\n\nOr rather, I thought I was alone, for there was a movement by one of the\nwindows and Miss Patty came forward and knelt by the dog.\n\n\"Of all the absurdities!\" she said. \"Poor little thing! Minnie, I\nbelieve she's breathing!\"\n\nShe put the dog's head in her lap, and the little beast opened its eyes\nand tried to wag its blue tail.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Patty, Miss Patty!\" I exclaimed, and I got down beside her and\ncried on her shoulder, with her stroking my hand and calling me dearest!\nMe!\n\nI was wiping my eyes when the door was thrown open and Mr. Pierce ran\nin. He had no hat on and his hair was powdered with snow. He stopped\njust inside the door and looked at Miss Patty.\n\n\"You--\" he said \"you are all right? You are not--\" he came forward and\nstood over her, with his heart in his eyes. She MUST have known from\nthat minute.\n\n\"My God!\" he exclaimed, \"I thought you were poisoned!\"\n\nShe looked up, without smiling, and then I thought she half shut her\neyes, as if what she saw in his face hurt her.\n\n\"I am all right,\" she assured him, \"and little Arabella will be\nall right, too. She's had a convulsion, that's all--probably from\novereating. As for the others--!\"\n\n\"Where is the--where is von Inwald?\"\n\n\"He has gone to take the white of an egg,\" she replied rather haughtily.\nShe was too honest to evade anything, but she flushed. Of course, I knew\nwhat he didn't--that the prince had been among the first to scurry to\nthe house, and that he hadn't even waited for her.\n\nHe walked to the window, as if he didn't want her to see what he thought\nof that, and I saw him looking hard at something outside in the snow.\nWhen he walked back to the fire he was smiling, and he stooped over and\npoked Arabella with his finger.\n\n\"So that was it!\" he said. \"Full to the scuppers, poor little wretch!\nMinnie, I am hoist with my own petard, which in this case was a\nboomerang.\"\n\n\"Which is in English--\" I asked.\n\n\"With the instinct of her sex, Arabella has unearthed what was meant\nto be buried forever. She had gorged herself into a convulsion on that\nrabbit I shot last night!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE MUTINY\n\nThey went to the house together, he carrying Arabella like a sick baby\nand Miss Patty beside him. As far as I could see they didn't speak a\nword to each other, but once or twice I saw her turn and look up at him\nas if she was puzzled.\n\nI closed the door and stood just inside, looking at father's picture\nover the mantel. As sure as I stood there, the eyes were fixed on the\nspring, and I sensed, as you may say, what they meant. I went over and\nlooked down into the spring, and it seemed to me it was darker than\nusual. It may have smelled stronger, but the edge had been taken off my\nnose, so to speak, by being there so long.\n\nFrom the spring I looked again at father, and his eyes were on me\nmournful and sad. I felt as though, if he'd been there, father would\nhave turned the whole affair to the advantage of the house, and it\nwas almost more than I could bear. I was only glad the old doctor's\nenlargement had not come yet. I couldn't have endured having it see what\nhad occurred.\n\nThe only thing I could think of was to empty the spring and let the\nwater come in plain. I could put a little sulphur in to give it color\nand flavor, and if it turned out that Mr. Pierce was right and that\nArabella was only a glutton, I could put in the other things later.\n\nI was carrying out my first pailful when Doctor Barnes came down the\npath and took the pail out of my hand.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" he asked. \"Making a slide?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said bitterly, \"I am watering the flowers.\"\n\n\"Good!\" He was not a bit put out. \"Let me help you.\" He took the pail\nacross the path and poured a little into the snow at the base of a\nhalf-dozen fence posts. \"There!\" he said, coming back triumphant.\n\"The roses are done. Now let's have a go at the pansies and the\nlady's-slippers and the--the begonias. I say\"--he stopped suddenly\non his way in--\"sulphur water on a begonia--what would it make? Skunk\ncabbage?\"\n\nInside, however, he put down the pail, and pulling me in, closed the\ndoor.\n\n\"Now forget it!\" he commanded. \"Just because a lot of damn fools see a\ndog in a fit and have one, too, is that any reason for your being scared\nwall-eyed and knock-kneed?\"\n\n\"I'm not!\" I snapped.\n\n\"Well, you're wall-eyed with fright,\" he insisted. \"Of course, you're\nthe best judge of your own knees, but after last night--Had any lunch?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"Exactly,\" he said. \"You make me think of the little boy who dug\npost-holes in the daytime and took in washings at night to support the\nfamily. Sit down.\"\n\nI sat.\n\n\"Inhale and exhale slowly four times, and then swallow the lump in your\nthroat.... Gone?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good.\" He was fumbling in his pocket and he brought out a napkin. When\nhe opened it there was a sandwich, a piece of cheese and a banana.\n\n\"What do you think of that?\" he asked, watching me anxiously. \"Looks\npretty good?\"\n\n\"Fine,\" I said, hating to disappoint him, although I never eat sardines,\nand bananas give me indigestion, \"I'm hungry enough to eat a raw\nItalian.\"\n\n\"Then fall to,\" he directed, and with a flourish he drew a bottle of\nginger ale from his pocket.\n\n\"How's this?\" he demanded, holding it up. \"Cheers but doesn't inebriate;\nnot a headache in a barrel; ginger ale to the gingery! 'A quart of ale\nis a dish for a king,'\" he said, holding up a glass. \"That's\nShakespeare, Miss Minnie.\"\n\nI was a good bit more cheerful when I'd choked down the sandwich,\nespecially when he assured me the water was all right--\"a little high,\nas you might say, but not poisonous. Lord, I wish you could have seen\nthem staggering into my office!\"\n\n\"I saw enough,\" I said with a shiver.\n\n\"That German, von Inwald,\" he went on, \"he's the limit. He accused us of\npoisoning him for reasons of state!\"\n\n\"Where are they now?\"\n\n\"My dear girl,\" he answered, putting down his glass, \"what has been\npounded into me ever since I struck the place? The baths! I prescribe\n'em all day and dream 'em all night. Where are the poisonees now?\nThey are steaming, stewing, exuding in the hot rooms of the bath\ndepartment--all of them, every one of them! In the hold and the hatches\ndown!\"\n\nHe picked up the pail and went down the steps to the spring.\n\n\"After all,\" he said, \"it won't hurt to take out a little of this and\npour it on the ground. It ought to be good fertilizer.\" He stooped.\n\"'Come, gentle spring, ethereal mildness, come,'\" he quoted, and dipped\nin the pail.\n\nJust then somebody fell against the door and stumbled into the room. It\nwas Tillie, as white as milk, and breathing in gasps.\n\n\"Quick!\" she screeched, \"Minnie, quick!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked, jumping up. She'd fallen back against the\ndoor-frame and stood with her hand clutching her heart.\n\n\"That dev--devil--Mike!\" she panted. \"He has turned on the steam in the\nmen's baths and gone--gone away!\"\n\n\"With people in the bath?\" Doctor Barnes asked, slamming down the pail.\n\nTillie nodded.\n\n\"Then why in creation don't they get out of the baths until we can shut\noff the steam?\" I demanded, grabbing up my shawl. But Tillie shook her\nhead in despair.\n\n\"They can't,\" she answered, \"he's hid their clothes!\"\n\nThe next thing I recall is running like mad up the walk with Doctor\nBarnes beside me, steadying me by the arm. I only spoke once that I\nremember and that was just as we got to the house,\n\n\"This settles it!\" I panted, desperately. \"It's all over.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it!\" he said, shoving me up the steps and into the hall.\n\"The old teakettle is just getting 'het up' a bit. By the gods and\nlittle fishes, just listen to it singing down there!\"\n\n\nThe help was gathered in a crowd at the head of the bath-house\nstaircase, where a cloud of steam was coming up, and down below we could\nhear furious talking, and somebody shouting, \"Mike! Mike!\" in a voice\nthat was choked with rage and steam.\n\nDoctor Barnes elbowed his way through the crowd to the top of the stairs\nand I followed.\n\n\"There's Minnie!\" Amanda King yelled. \"She knows all about the place.\nMinnie, you can shut it off, can't you?\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" I said, and was starting down, when Doctor Barnes jerked me\nback.\n\n\"You stay here,\" he said. \"Where's Mr. Pier--where's Carter?\"\n\n\"Down with the engineer,\" somebody replied out of the steam cloud.\n\n\"Hello there!\" he called down the staircase. \"How's the air?\"\n\n\"Clothes! Send us some clothes!\"\n\nIt was Mr. Sam calling. The rest was swallowed up in a fresh roaring,\nas if a steam-pipe had given away. That settled the people below. With\na burst of fury they swarmed up the stairs in their bath sheets, the\nbishop leading, and just behind him, talking as no gentleman should talk\nunder any circumstances, Senator Biggs. The rest followed, their red\nfaces shining through the steam--all of them murderous, holding their\nsheets around them with one hand, and waving the other in a frenzy. It\nwas awful.\n\nThe help scattered and ran, but I stood my ground. The sight of a man in\na sheet didn't scare me and it was no time for weakness.\n\nThe steam was thicker than ever, and the hall was misty. A moment later\nthe engineer came up and after him Mr. Pierce, with a towel over his\nmouth and a screw-driver in his hand. He was white with rage. He brushed\npast the sheets without paying the slightest attention to them, and tore\nthe towel off his mouth.\n\n\"Who saw Mike last?\" he shouted across to where the pharmacy clerk, the\nelevator boy and some of the bell-boys had retreated to the office and\nwere peeping out through the door.\n\nHere Mr. Moody, who's small at any time, and who without the padding\non his shoulders and wrapped in a sheet with his red face above, looked\nlike a lighted cigarette, darted out of the crowd and caught him by the\nsleeve.\n\n\"Here!\" he cried, \"we've got a few things to say to you, you young--\"\n\n\"Take your hand off my arm!\" thundered Mr. Pierce.\n\nThe storm broke with that. They crowded around Mr. Pierce, yelling like\nmaniacs, and he stood there, white-faced, and let them wear themselves\nout. The courage of a man in a den of lions was nothing to it. Doctor\nBarnes forced his way through the crowd and stood there beside him.\n\nIt wasn't only the steam and their clothes being hidden; it had started\nwith the scare at the spring in the morning, and when they had told him\nwhat they thought about that, they went back still further and bellowed\nabout the mismanagement of the place ever since he had taken charge, and\nthe food, and the steam-heat, and the new rules--oh, they hated him all\nright, and they told him so, purple-faced with rage and heat, dancing\naround him and shaking one fist in his face, as I say, while they held\ntheir sheets fast with the other.\n\nAnd I stood there and watched, my mind awhirl, expecting every minute\nto hear that they were all leaving, or to have some one forget and shake\nboth fists at once.\n\nAnd that's how it ended finally--I mean, of course, that they said they\nwould all leave immediately, and that he ought to be glad to have\nthem go quietly, and not have him jailed for malicious mischief or\ncompounding a felony. The whole thing was an outrage, and the three\ntrain would leave the house as empty as a squeezed lemon.\n\nI wanted to go forward and drop on my knees and implore them to remember\nthe old doctor, and the baths they'd had when nothing went wrong, and\nthe days when they'd sworn that the spring kept them young and well, but\nthere was something in Mr. Pierce's face that kept me back.\n\n\"At three o'clock, then,\" he said. \"Very well.\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool!\" I heard Mr. Sam from the crowd.\n\n\"Is that all you have to say?\" roared Mr. von Inwald. I hadn't noticed\nhim before. He had his sheet on in Grecian style and it looked quite\nornamental although a little short. \"Haven't you any apology to make,\nsir?\"\n\n\"Neither apology nor explanation to you,\" Mr. Pierce retorted. And to\nthe other: \"It is an unfortunate accident--incident, if you prefer.\" He\nlooked at Thoburn, who was the only one in a bath robe, and who was the\nonly cheerful one in the lot. \"I had refused a request of the bath\nman's and he has taken this form of revenge. If this gives me the\nresponsibility I am willing to take it. If you expect me to ask you to\nstay I'll not do it. I don't mind saying that I am as tired of all this\nas you are.\"\n\n\"As tired of what?\" demanded Mr. Moody, pushing forward out of the\ncrowd. Mr. Sam was making frantic gestures to catch Mr. Pierce's eye,\nbut he would not look at him.\n\n\"Of all this,\" he said. \"Of charging people sanatorium prices under a\npretense of making them well. Does anybody here imagine he's going to\nfind health by sitting around in an overstuffed leather chair, with the\ntemperature at eighty, eating five meals a day, and walking as far as\nthe mineral spring for exercise?\"\n\nThere was a sort of angry snarl in the air, and Mr. Sam threw up his one\nfree hand in despair.\n\n\"In fact,\" Mr. Pierce went on, \"I'd about decided on a new order of\nthings for this place anyhow. It's going to be a real health resort,\nrun for people who want to get well or keep well. People who wish to be\noverfed, overheated and coddled need not come--or stay.\"\n\nThe bishop spoke over the heads of the others, who looked dazed.\n\n\"Does that mean,\" he inquired mildly, \"that--guests must either obey\nthis new order of things or go away?\"\n\nMr. Pierce looked at the bishop and smiled.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" he said, \"but as every one is leaving, anyhow--\"\n\nThey fairly jumped at him then. They surrounded him in a howling mob and\ndemanded how he dared to turn them out, and what did he mean by saying\nthey were overfed, and they would leave when they were good and ready\nand not before, and he could go to blazes. It was the most scandalous\nthing I've ever known of at Hope Springs, and in the midst of it Mr.\nPierce stood cool and quiet, waiting for a chance to speak. And when\nthe time came he jumped in and told them the truth about themselves, and\nmost of it hurt.\n\nHe was good and mad, and he stood there and picked out the flabby ones\nand the fat ones, the whisky livers and the tobacco hearts and the\nbanquet stomachs, and called them out by name.\n\nWhen he got through they were standing in front of him, ashamed to look\nat one another, and not knowing whether to fall on him and tear him to\npieces, or go and weep in a corner because they'd played such havoc with\nthe bodies the Lord gave them. If he'd weakened for a minute they'd have\njumped on him. But he didn't. He got through and stood looking at them\nin their sheets, and then he said coolly:\n\n\"The bus will be ready at two-thirty, gentlemen,\" and turning on his\nheels, went into the office and closed the door.\n\nThey scattered to their rooms in every stage of rage and excitement,\nand at last only Mr. Sam and I were left staring at each other. \"Damned\nyoung idiot!\" he said. \"I wish to heavens you'd never suggested bringing\nhim here, Minnie!\"\n\nAnd leaving me speechless with indignation, he trailed himself and his\nsheet up the stairs.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nHOME TO ROOST\n\nI couldn't stand any more. It was all over! I rushed to my room and\nthrew myself on the bed. At two-thirty I heard the bus come to the\nporte-cochere under my window and then drive away; that was the last\nstraw. I put a pillow over my head so nobody could hear me, and then and\nthere I had hysterics. I knew I was having them, and I wasn't ashamed.\nI'd have exploded if I hadn't. And then somebody jerked the pillow away\nand I looked up, with my eyes swollen almost shut, and it was Doctor\nBarnes. He had a glass of water in his hand and he held it right above\nme.\n\n\"One more yell,\" he said, \"and it goes over you!\"\n\nI lay there staring up at him, and then I knew what a fright I looked,\nand although I couldn't speak yet, I reached up and felt for my\nhairpins.\n\n\"That's better,\" he said, putting down the glass. \"Another ten minutes\nof that and you'd have burst a blood vessel. Don't worry. I know I have\nno business here, but I anticipated something of this kind, and it may\ninterest you to know that I've been outside in the hall since the first\nwhoop. It's been a good safety-valve.\"\n\nI sat up and stared at him. I could hardly see out of my eyes. He had\nhis back to the light, but I could tell that he had a cross of adhesive\nplaster on his cheek and that one eye was almost shut. He smiled when he\nsaw my expression.\n\n\"It's the temperament,\" he said. \"It goes with the hair. I've got it\ntoo, only I'm apt to go out and pick a fight at such times, and a woman\nhasn't got that outlet. As you see, I found Mike, and my disfigurement\nis to Mike's as starlight to the noonday glare. Come and take a walk.\"\n\nI shook my head, but he took my arm and pulled me off the bed.\n\n\"You come for a walk!\" he said. \"I'll wait in the hall until you powder\nyour nose. You look like a fire that's been put out by a rain-storm.\"\n\n\nI didn't want to go, but anything was better than sitting in the room\nmoping. I put on my jacket and Miss Patty's chinchillas, which cheered\nme a little, but as we went downstairs the quiet of the place sat on my\nchest like a weight.\n\nThe lower hall was empty. A new card headed \"Rules\" hung on the door\ninto the private office, but I did not read it. What was the use of\nrules without people to disobey them? Mrs. Moody had forgotten her\ncrocheting bag and it hung on the back of a chair. I had to bite my lip\nto keep it from trembling again.\n\n\"The Jenningses are still here,\" said the doctor. \"The old man is madder\nthan any hornet ever dared be, and they go in the morning. But the\nsituation was too much for our German friend. He left with the others.\"\n\nWell, we went out and I took the path I knew best, which was out toward\nthe spring-house. There wasn't a soul in sight. The place looked lonely,\nwith the trees hung with snow, and arching over the board walk. At the\nlittle bridge over the creek Doctor Barnes stopped, and leaning over the\nrail, took a good look at me.\n\n\"When you self-contained women go to pieces,\" he said, \"you pretty near\nsmash, don't you? You look as if you'd had a death in your family.\"\n\n\"This WAS my family,\" I half sniveled.\n\n\"But,\" he said, \"you'll be getting married and having a home of your own\nand forgetting all about this.\"\n\nHe looked at me with his sharp eyes. \"There's probably some nice chap in\nthe village, eh?\"\n\nI shook my head. I had just caught sight of the broken pieces of the\nMoody water-pitcher on the ice below.\n\n\"No nice young man!\" he remarked. \"Not the telegraph operator, or the\nfellow who runs the livery-stable--I've forgotten his name.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" I turned on him, \"if you're talking all this nonsense to\nkeep my mind off things, you needn't.\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" he said. \"I'm asking for the sake of my own mind, but we'll\nnot bother about that now. We'd better start back.\"\n\nIt was still snowing, although not so hard. The air had done me some\ngood, but the lump in my throat seemed to have gone to my chest. The\ndoctor helped me along, for the snow was drifting, and when he saw I was\npast the crying stage he went back to what we were both thinking about.\n\n\"Old Pierce is right,\" he said. \"Remember, Miss Minnie, I've nothing\nagainst you or your mineral spring; in fact, I'm strong for you both.\nBut while I'm out of the ring now for good--I don't mind saying to you\nwhat I said to Pierce, that the only thing that gets into training here,\nas far as I can see, is a fellow's pocketbook.\"\n\nWe went back to the house and I straightened the news stand, Amanda\nKing having taken a violent toothache as a result of the excitement.\nThe Jenningses were packing to go, and Miss Summers had got a bottle of\nperoxide and shut herself in her room. At six o'clock Tillie beckoned\nto me from the door of the officers' dining-room and said she'd put the\nbasket in the snow by the grape arbor. I got ready, with a heavy heart,\nto take it out. I had forgotten all about their dinner, for one thing,\nand I had to carry bad news.\n\nBut Mr. Pierce had been there before me. I saw tracks in the fresh snow,\nfor, praise heaven! it had snowed all that week and our prints\nwere filled up almost as fast as we made them. When I got to the\nshelter-house it was in a wild state of excitement. Mrs. Dick, with her\ncheeks flushed, had gathered all her things on the cot and was rolling\nthem up in sheets and newspapers. But Mr. Dick was sitting on the box\nin front of the fire with his curly hair standing every way. He had been\nroasting potatoes, and as I opened the door, he picked one up and poked\nat it to see if it was done.\n\n\"Damn!\" he said, and dropped it.\n\nMrs. Dick sat on the cot rolling up a pink ribbon and looked at him.\n\n\"If you want to know exactly my reason for insisting on moving to-night,\nI'll tell you,\" she said, paying no attention to me. \"It is your\ndisposition.\"\n\nHe didn't say anything, but he put his foot on the potato and smashed\nit.\n\n\"If I had to be shut in here with you one more day,\" she went on, \"I'd\nhate you.\"\n\n\"Why the one more day?\" he asked, without looking up.\n\nBut she didn't answer him. She was in the worst kind of a temper; she\nthrew the ribbon down, and coming over, lifted the lid of my basket and\nlooked in.\n\n\"Ham again!\" she exclaimed ungratefully. \"Thanks so much for remembering\nus, Minnie. I dare say our dinner to-day slipped your mind!\"\n\n\"I wonder if it strikes you, Minnie,\" Mr. Dick said, noticing me for\nthe first time, \"that if you and Sam hadn't been so confounded meddling,\nthat fellow Pierce would be washing buggies in the village livery-stable\nwhere he belongs, and I'd be in one piece of property that's as good as\ngone this minute.\"\n\n\"Egg salad and cheese!\" said Mrs. Dick. \"I'm sick of cheese. If that's\nthe kind of supper you've been serving--\"\n\nBut I was in a bad humor, anyhow, and I'd had enough. I stood just\ninside the door and I told them I'd done the best I could, not for them,\nbut because I'd promised the old doctor, and if I'd made mistakes I'd\nanswer for them to him if I ever met him in the next world. And in the\nmeantime I washed my hands of the whole thing, and they might make out\nas best they could. I was going.\n\nMrs. Dick heard me through. Then she came over and put her hand on mine\nwhere it lay on the table.\n\n\"You're perfectly right,\" she said. \"I know how you have tried, and that\nthe fault is all that wretched Pierce's. You mustn't mind Mr. Carter,\nMinnie. He's been in that sort of humor all day.\"\n\nHe looked at her with the most miserable face I ever saw, but he didn't\nsay anything. She sighed, the little wretch.\n\n\"We've all made mistakes,\" she said, \"and not the least was my thinking\nthat I--well, never mind. I dare say we will manage somehow.\"\n\nHe got up then, his face twisted with misery.\n\n\"Say it,\" he said. \"You hate me; you shiver if I touch your hand--oh,\nI'm not very keen, but I saw that.\"\n\n\"The remedy for that is very, simple,\" she replied coolly. \"You needn't\ntouch my hand.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" I snapped. \"Just stop before you say something you'll be sorry\nfor. Of course, you hate each other. It beats me, anyhow, why two people\nwho get married always want to get away by themselves until they're so\nsick of each other that they don't get over it the rest of their\nlives. The only sensible honeymoon I ever heard of was when one of the\nchambermaids here married a farmer in the neighborhood. It was harvest\nand he couldn't leave, so she went ALONE to see her folks and she said\nit beat having him along all hollow.\"\n\nShe was setting out the supper, putting things down with a bang. He\ndidn't move, although he must have been starving.\n\n\"Another thing I'd advise,\" I said. \"Eat first and talk after. You'll\nsee things different after you've got something in your stomach.\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't meddle, Minnie!\" she snapped, and having put down\nher own plate and knife and fork, not laying a place for him, she went\nover and tried to get one of the potatoes from the fire.\n\nWell, she burnt her finger, or pretended to, and I guess her solution\nwas as good as mine, for she began to cry, and when I left he was tying\nit up with a bit of his handkerchief; if she shivered when he kissed it\nI didn't notice it. They were to come up to the house after her father\nleft in the morning, and I was to dismiss all the old help and get new\nones so he could take charge and let Mr. Pierce go.\n\nI plodded back with my empty basket. I had only one clear thought,--that\nI wouldn't have any more tramping across the golf links in the snow. I\nwas too tired really to care that with the regular winter boarders gone\nand eight weeks still until Lent, we'd hardly be able to keep going\nanother fortnight. I wanted to get back to my room and go to bed and\nforget.\n\nBut as I came near the house I saw Mr. Pierce come out on the front\npiazza and switch on the lights. He stood there looking out into the\nsnow, and the next minute I saw why. Coming up the hill and across the\nlawn was a shadowy line of people, black against the white. They were\nnot speaking, and they moved without noise over the snow. I thought for\na minute that my brain had gone wrong; then the first figure came into\nthe light, and it was the bishop. He stood at the front of the steps and\nlooked up at Mr. Pierce.\n\n\"I dare say,\" he said, trying to look easy, \"that this is sooner than\nyou expected us!\"\n\nMr. Pierce looked down at the crowd. Then he smiled, a growing smile\nthat ended in a grin.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" he said, \"I've been expecting you for an hour or\nmore.\"\n\nThe procession began to move gloomily up the steps. All of them carried\nhand luggage, and they looked tired and sheepish Miss Cobb stopped in\nfront of Mr. Pierce.\n\n\"Do you mean to say,\" she demanded furiously, \"that you knew the\nrailroad was blocked with snow, and yet you let us go!\"\n\n\"On the contrary, Miss Cobb,\" he said politely, \"I remember distinctly\nregretting that you insisted on going. Besides, there was the Sherman\nHouse.\"\n\nSenator Briggs {sic} stopped in front of him. \"Probably you also knew\nthat THAT was full, including the stables, with people from the stalled\ntrains,\" he asserted furiously.\n\nTwo by two they went in and through the hall, stamping the snow off, and\nup to their old rooms again, leaving Slocum, the clerk, staring at them\nas if he couldn't believe his eyes.\n\nMr. Pierce and I watched from the piazza, through the glass.\n\nWe saw Doctor Barnes stop and look, and then go and hang over the news\nstand and laugh himself almost purple, and we saw Mr. Thoburn bringing\nup the tail of the procession and trying to look unconcerned. I am not a\nrevengeful woman, but that was one of the happiest moments of my life.\n\nDoctor Barnes turned suddenly, and catching me by the arm, whirled me\naround and around, singing wildly something about Noah and \"the animals\nwent in two by, two, the elephant and the kangaroo.\"\n\nHe stopped as suddenly as he began and walked me to the door again.\n\n\"We've got 'em in the ark,\" he said, \"but I'm thinking this forty days\nof snow is nearly over, Minnie. I don't think much of the dove and the\nolive-branch, but WE'VE GOT TO KEEP THEM.\"\n\n\"It's against the law,\" I quavered.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" he said. \"We've got to make 'em WANT to stay!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nBACK TO NATURE\n\nWe gave them a good supper and Mr. Pierce ordered claret served without\nextra charge. By eight o'clock they were all in better humor, and when\nthey'd gathered in the lobby Miss Summers gave an imitation of Marie\nDressler doing the Salome dance. Every now and then somebody would look\nout and say it was still snowing, and with the memory of the drifts and\nthe cold stove in the railroad station behind them, they'd gather closer\naround the fire and insist that they would go as soon as the road was\ncleared.\n\nBut with the exception of Mr. von Inwald, not one of them really wanted\nto go. As Doctor Barnes said over the news stand, each side was bluffing\nand wouldn't call the other, and the fellow with the most nerve would\nwin.\n\n\"And, oh, my aunt!\" he said, \"what a sweet disposition the von Inwald\nhas! Watch him going up and banging his head against the wall!\"\n\nEverybody was charmed with the Salome dance, especially when Miss\nSummers drew the cover off a meat platter she'd been dancing around,\nand there was Arabella sitting on her hind legs, with a card tied to her\nneck, and the card said that at eleven there would be a clambake in the\nkitchen for all the guests.\n\n(The clambake was my idea, but the dog, of course, was Miss Julia's. I\nnever saw a woman so full of ideas, although it seems that what should\nhave been on the platter was the head of somebody or other.)\n\nJust after the dance I saw Mr. von Inwald talking to Miss Patty. He had\nbeen ugly all evening, and now he looked like a devil. She stood facing\nhim with her head thrown back and her fingers twisting her ruby ring.\nI guessed that she was about as much surprised as anything else, people\nhaving a habit of being pleasant to her most of the time. He left her\nin a rage, and as he went he collided with Arabella and kicked her.\nMiss Patty went white but Miss Summers was not a bit put out. She simply\npicked up the howling dog and confronted Mr. von Inwald.\n\n\"Perhaps you didn't notice,\" she said sweetly, \"but you kicked my dog.\"\n\n\"Why don't you keep her out of the way?\" he snarled, and they stood\nglaring at each other.\n\n\"Under the circumstances, Arabella,\" Miss Julia said--and everybody\nwas listening--\"we can only withdraw Mr. von Inwald's invitation to the\nkitchen.\"\n\n\"Thank you, I had not intended to go,\" he said furiously, and went out\ninto the veranda, slamming the door behind him. Mr. Jennings looked up\nfrom where he was playing chess by the fire and nodded at Miss Summers.\n\n\"Serves him right for his temper!\" he said.\n\n\"Checkmate!\" said the bishop.\n\nMr. Jennings turned and glared at the board. Then with one sweep he\nthrew all the chessmen on the floor. As Tillie said later, it would be\na pity to spoil two houses with Mr. von Inwald and Mr. Jennings If they\nwere in the same family, they could work it off on each other.\n\nMiss Patty came down to the news stand and pretended to hunt for a\nmagazine. I reached over and stroked her hand. \"Don't take it too hard,\ndearie,\" I said. \"He's put out to-night, and maybe he isn't well. Men\nare like babies. If their stomachs are all right and have plenty in\nthem, they're pleasant enough. It's been my experience that your cranky\nman's a sick man.\"\n\n\"I don't think he is sick, Minnie,\" she said, with a catch in her voice.\n\"I--I think he is just dev--devilish!\"\n\nWell, I thought that too, so I just stroked her hand, and after a minute\nshe got her color again. \"It is hard for him,\" she said. \"He thinks this\nis all vulgar and American, and--oh, Minnie, I want to get away, and yet\nwhat shall I do without you to keep me sensible.\"\n\n\"You'll be a long ways off soon,\" I said, touching the ring under my\nhand.\n\n\"I wish you could come with me,\" she said, but I shook my head.\n\n\"Here is one dog that isn't going to sit under any rich man's table and\nhowl for crumbs,\" I answered. \"If he kicked ME, I'd bite him.\"\n\nAt eleven o'clock we had the clambake with beer in the kitchen, and Mr.\nvon Inwald came, after all. They were really very cheerful, all of them.\nDoctor Barnes insisted that Senator Biggs must not fast any longer, and\nhe ate by my count three dozen clams. At the end, when everybody was\nhappy and everything forgiven, Mr. Pierce got up and made a speech.\n\nHe said he was sorry for what had happened that day, but that much he\nhad said he still maintained: that to pretend to make people well in\nthe way most sanatoriums did it was sheer folly, and he felt his\nresponsibility too keenly to countenance a system that was clearly wrong\nand that the best modern thought considered obsolete.\n\nMiss Cobb sat up at that; she is always talking about the best modern\nthought.\n\nHe said that perfect health, clear skins, bright eyes--he looked at the\nwomen, and except for Miss Patty, there wasn't an honest complexion or a\nbright eye in the lot--keen appetites and joy of living all depended on\nrational and simple living.\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" said the men.\n\n\"The nearer we live to nature, the better,\" said Senator Biggs\noracularly.\n\n\"Back to nature,\" shouted Mr. Moody through a clam.\n\n\"Exactly,\" Mr. Pierce said, smiling.\n\nMrs. Moody looked alarmed. \"You don't mean doing without clothes--and\nall that!\" she protested.\n\n\"Surely!\" Miss Summers said, holding up her beer glass. \"A toast,\neverybody! Back to nature, sans rats, sans rouge, sans stays, sans\neverything. I'll need to wear a tag with my name on it. Nobody will\nrecognize me!\"\n\nMr. Pierce got up again at the head of the long kitchen table and said\nhe merely meant rational living--more air, more exercise, simpler food\nand better hours. It was being done now in a thousand fresh-air farms,\nand succeeding. Men went back to their business clearer-headed and women\ngrew more beautiful.\n\nAt that, what with the reaction from sitting in the cold station, and\nthe beer and everything, they all grew enthusiastic. Doctor Barnes made\na speech, telling that he used to be puny and weak, and how he went\ninto training and became a pugilist, and how he'd fought the Tennessee\nsomething or other--the men nodded as if they knew--and licked him in\nforty seconds or forty rounds, I'm not sure which. The men were standing\non their chairs cheering for him, and even Mr. Jennings, who'd been\nsitting and not saying much, said he thought probably there was\nsomething in it.\n\nThey ended by agreeing to try it out for a week, beginning with the\nmorning, when everybody was to be down for breakfast by seven-thirty.\nMr. Thoburn got up and made a speech, protesting that they didn't know\nwhat they were letting themselves in for, and ended up by demanding to\nknow if he was expected to breakfast at seven-thirty.\n\n\"Yes, or earlier,\" Mr. Pierce said pleasantly. \"I suppose you could have\nsomething at seven.\"\n\n\"And suppose I refuse?\" he retorted disagreeably.\n\nBut everybody turned on him, and said if they could do it, he could, and\nhe sat down again. Then somebody suggested that if they were to get up\nthey'd have to go to bed, and the party broke up.\n\nDoctor Barnes helped me gather up the clam shells and the plates.\n\n\"It's a risky business,\" he said. \"To-night doesn't mean anything;\nthey're carried away by the reaction and the desire for something new.\nThe next week will tell the tale.\"\n\n\"If we could only get rid of Mr. Thoburn!\" I exclaimed. Doctor Barnes\nchuckled.\n\n\"We may not get rid of him,\" he said, \"but I can promise him the most\ninteresting week of his life. He'll be too busy for mischief. I'm going\nto take six inches off his waist line.\"\n\nWell, in a half-hour or so I had cleared away, and I went out to the\nlobby to lock up the news stand. Just as I opened the door from the back\nhall, however, I heard two people talking.\n\nIt was Miss Pat and Mr. Pierce. She was on the stairs and he in the hall\nbelow, looking up.\n\n\"I don't WANT to stay!\" she was saying.\n\n\"But don't you see?\" he argued. \"If you go, the others will. Can't you\ntry it for a week?\"\n\n\"I quite understand your motive,\" she said, looking down at him more\npleasantly than she'd ever done, \"and it's very good of you and all\nthat. But if you'd only left things as they were, and let us all go, and\nother people come--\"\n\n\"That's just it,\" he said. \"I'm told it's the bad season and nobody else\nwould come until Lent. And, anyhow, it's not business to let a lot of\npeople go away mad. It gives the place a black eye.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" she said, \"how businesslike you are growing!\"\n\nHe went over close to the stairs and dropped his voice.\n\n\"If you want the bitter truth,\" he went on, trying to smile, \"I've put\nmyself on trial and been convicted of being a fool and a failure. I've\nfailed regularly and with precision at everything I have tried. I've\nbeen going around so long trying to find a place that I fit into, that\nI'm scarred as with many battles. And now I'm on probation--for the last\ntime. If this doesn't go, I--I--\"\n\n\"What?\" she asked, leaning down to him. \"You'll not--\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" he said, \"nothing dramatic, of course. I could go around the\ncountry in a buggy selling lightning-rods--\"\n\nShe drew herself back as if she resented his refusal of her sympathy.\n\n\"Or open a saloon in the Philippines!\" he finished mockingly. \"There's a\nliving in that.\"\n\n\"You are impossible,\" she said, and turned away.\n\nOh, I haven't any excuse to make for him! I think he was just hungry for\nher sympathy and her respect, knowing nothing else was coming to him.\nBut the minute they grew a bit friendly he seemed to remember the\nprince, and that, according to his idea of it, she was selling herself,\nand he would draw off and look at her in a mocking unhappy way that made\nme want to slap him.\n\nHe watched her up the stairs and then turned and walked to the fire,\nwith his hands in his pockets and his head down.\n\nI closed the news stand and he came over just as I was hanging up the\ncigar-case key for Amanda King in the morning. He reached up and took\nthe key off its nail.\n\n\"I'll keep that,\" he said. \"It's no tobacco after this, Minnie.\"\n\n\"You can't keep them here, then,\" I retorted. \"They've got to smoke;\nit's the only work they do.\"\n\n\"We'll see,\" he said quietly. \"And--oh, yes, Minnie, now that we shall\nnot be using the mineral spring--\"\n\n\"Not use the mineral spring!\" I repeated, stupefied.\n\n\"Certainly NOT!\" he said. \"This is a drugless sanatorium, Minnie, from\nnow on. That's part of the theory--no drugs.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you one thing,\" I snapped, \"theory or no theory, you've\ngot to have drugs. No theory that I ever heard of is going to cure Mr.\nMoody's indigestion and Miss Cobb's neuralgia.\"\n\n\"They won't have indigestion and neuralgia.\"\n\n\"Or Amanda King's toothache.\"\n\n\"We won't have Amanda King.\"\n\nHe put his elbow on the stand and smiled at me.\n\n\"Listen, Minnie,\" he said. \"If you hadn't been wasting your abilities in\nthe mineral spring, I'd be sorry to close it. But there will be plenty\nfor you to do. Don't you know that the day of the medicine-closet in the\nbath-room and the department-store patent-remedy counter is over? We've\ngot sanatoriums now instead of family doctors. In other words, we put in\ngood sanitation systems and don't need the plumber and his repair kit.\"\n\n\"The pharmacy?\" I said between my teeth.\n\n\"Closed also. No medicine, Minnie. That's our slogan. This is the day\nof prophylaxis. The doctors have taken a step in the right direction\nand are giving fewer drugs. Christian Science has abolished drugs and\nestablished the healer. We simply abolish the healer.\"\n\n\"If we're not going to use the spring-house, we might have saved the\nexpense of the new roof in the fall,\" I said bitterly.\n\n\"Not at all. For two hours or so a day the spring-house will be\na rest-house--windows wide open and God's good air penetrating to\nfastnesses it never knew before.\"\n\n\"The spring will freeze!\"\n\n\"Exactly. My only regret is that it is too small to skate on. But\nthey'll have the ice pond.\"\n\n\"When I see Mr. Moody skating on the ice pond,\" I said sarcastically,\n\"I'll see Mrs. Moody dead with the shock on the bank.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" he replied calmly. \"You'll see her skating, too.\" And with\nthat he went to bed.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nLIKE DUCKS TO WATER\n\nThey took to it like ducks take to water. Not, of course, that they\ndidn't kick about making their own beds and having military discipline\ngenerally. They complained a lot, but when after three days went by with\nthe railroad running as much on schedule as it ever does, they were all\nstill there, and Mr. Jennings had limped out and spent a half-hour at\nthe wood-pile with his gouty foot on a cushion, I saw it was a success.\n\nI ought to have been glad. I was, although when Mrs. Dicky found they\nwere all staying, and that she might have to live in the shelter-house\nthe rest of the winter, there was an awful scene. I was glad, too, every\ntime I could see Mr. Thoburn's gloomy face, or hear the things he said\nwhen his name went up for the military walk.\n\n(Oh yes, we had a blackboard in the hall, and every morning each guest\nlooked to see if it was wood-pile day or military-walk day. At first,\ninstead of wood-pile, it was walk-clearing day, but they soon had the\nsnow off all the paths.)\n\nAs I say, I was glad. It looked as if the new idea was a success,\nalthough as Doctor Barnes said, nobody could really tell until new\npeople began to come. That was the real test. They had turned the baths\ninto a gymnasium and they had beginners' classes and advanced classes,\nand a prize offered on the blackboard of a cigar for the man who made\nthe most muscular improvement in a week. The bishop won it the first\nweek, being the only one who could lie on his back and raise himself to\na sitting position without helping himself with his hands. As Mrs. Moody\nsaid, it would be easy enough if somebody only sat on one's feet to hold\nthem down.\n\nBut I must say I never got over the shock of seeing the spring-house\ndrifted with snow, all the windows wide open, the spring frozen hard,\nand people sitting there during the rest hour, in furs and steamer rugs,\ntrying to play cards with mittens on--their hands, not the cards, of\ncourse--and not wrangling. I was lonesome for it!\n\nI hadn't much to do, except from two to four to be at the spring-house,\nand to count for the deep-breathing exercise. Oh, yes, we had that, too!\nI rang a bell every half-hour and everybody got up, and I counted slowly\n\"one\" and they breathed in through their noses, and \"two\" and they\nexhaled quickly through their mouths. I guess most of them used more of\ntheir lungs than they ever knew they had.\n\nWell, everybody looked better and felt better, although they wouldn't\nall acknowledge it. Miss Cobb suffered most, not having the fire log\nto curl her hair with. But as she said herself, between gymnasium and\nmilitary walks, and the silence hour, and eating, which took a long\ntime, everybody being hungry--and going to bed at nine, she didn't see\nhow she could have worried with it, anyhow. The fat ones, of course,\nobjected to an apple and a cup of hot water for breakfast, but except\nMr. Thoburn, they all realized it was for the best. He wasn't there for\nhis health, he said, having never had a sick day in his life, but when\nhe saw it was apple and hot water or leave, he did like Adam--he took\nthe apple.\n\nThe strange thing of all was the way they began to look up to Mr.\nPierce. He was very strict; if he made a rule, it was obey or leave.\n(As they knew after Mr. Moody refused to take the military walk, and was\npresented with his bill and a railroad schedule within an hour. He had\nto take the military walk with Doctor Barnes that afternoon alone.) They\nhad to respect a man who could do all the things in the gymnasium that\nthey couldn't, and come in from a ten or fifteen-mile tramp through the\nsnow and take a cold plunge and a swim to rest himself.\n\nIt was on Monday that we really got things started, and on Monday\nafternoon Miss Summers came out to the shelter-house in a towering rage.\n\n\"Where's Mr. Pierce?\" she demanded.\n\n\"I guess you can see he isn't here,\" I said.\n\n\"Just wait until I see him!\" she announced. \"Do you know that I am down\non the blackboard for the military walk to-day?\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nShe turned and glared at me. \"Why not?\" she repeated. \"Why, the audacity\nof the wretch! He brings me out into the country in winter to play in\nhis atrocious play, strands me, and then tells me to walk twenty miles a\nday and smile over it!\" She came over to me and shook my arm. \"Not only\nthat,\" she said, \"but he has cut out my cigarettes and put Arabella on\ndog biscuit--Arabella, who can hardly eat a chicken wing.\"\n\n\"Well, there's something to be thankful for,\" I said. \"He didn't put you\non dog biscuit.\"\n\nShe laughed then, with one of her quick changes of humor.\n\n\"The worst of it is,\" she said, in a confidential whisper, \"I'll do it.\nI feel it. I guess if the truth were known I'm some older than he is,\nbut--I'm afraid of him, Minnie. Little Judy is ready to crawl around and\nspeak for a cracker or a kind word. Oh, I'm not in love with him, but\nhe's got the courage to say what he means and do what he says.\"\n\nShe went to the door and looked back smiling.\n\n\"I'm off for the wood-pile,\" she called back. \"And I've promised to chop\ntwo inches off my heels.\"\n\nAs I say, they took to it like ducks to water--except two of them, von\nInwald and Thoburn. Mr. von Inwald stayed on, I hardly know why, but I\nguess it was because Mr. Jennings still hadn't done anything final about\nsettlements, and with the newspapers marrying him every day it wasn't\nvery comfortable. Next to him, Mr. Thoburn was the unhappiest mortal I\nhave ever seen. He wouldn't leave, and with Doctor Barnes carrying\nout his threat to take six inches off his waist, he stopped measuring\nwindow-frames with a tape line and took to measuring himself.\n\nI came across him on Wednesday--the third day--straggling home from the\nmilitary walk. He and Mr. von Inwald limped across the tennis-court and\ncollapsed on the steps of the spring-house while the others went on to\nthe sanatorium. I had been brushing the porch, and I leaned on my broom\nand looked at them.\n\n\"You're both looking a lot better,\" I said. \"Not so--well, not so\nbeer-y. How do you like it by this time?\"\n\n\"Fine!\" answered Mr. Thoburn. \"Wouldn't stay if I didn't like it.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"But I'll tell you this, Minnie,\" he said, changing his position with\na groan to look up at me, \"somebody ought to warn that young man. Human\nnature can stand a lot but it can't stand everything. He's overdoing\nit!\"\n\n\"They like it,\" I said.\n\n\"They think they do,\" he retorted. \"Mark my words, Minnie, if he adds\nanother mile to the walk to-morrow there will be a mutiny. Kingdoms may\nbe lost by an extra blister on a heel.\"\n\nMr. von Inwald had been sitting with his feet straight out, scowling,\nbut now he turned and looked at me coolly.\n\n\"All that keeps me here,\" he said, \"is Minnie's lovely hair. It takes me\nmentally back home, Minnie, to a lovely lady--may I have a bit of it to\nkeep by me?\"\n\n\"You may not,\" I retorted angrily.\n\n\"Oh! The lovely lady--but never mind that. For the sake of my love for\nyou, Minnie, find me a cigarette, like a good girl! I am desolate.\"\n\n\"There's no tobacco on the place,\" I said firmly, and went on with my\nsweeping.\n\n\"When I was a boy,\" Mr. Thoburn remarked, looking out thoughtfully\nover the snow, \"we made a sort of cigarette out of corn-silk. You don't\nhappen to have any corn-silk about, do you, Minnie?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said shortly. \"If you take my advice, Mr. Thoburn, you'll go\nback to town. You can get all the tobacco you want there--and you're\nwasting your time here.\" I leaned on my broom and looked down at him,\nbut he was stretching out his foot and painfully working his ankle up\nand down.\n\n\"Am I?\" he asked, looking at his foot. \"Well, don't count on it too\nmuch, Minnie. You always inspire me, and sitting here I've just thought\nof something.\"\n\nHe got up and hobbled off the porch, followed by Mr. von Inwald. I\nsaw him say something to Mr. von Inwald, who threw back his head and\nlaughed. Then I saw them stop and shake hands and go on again in deep\nconversation. I felt uneasy.\n\n\nDoctor Barnes came out that afternoon and watched me while I closed\nthe windows. He had a package in his hand. He sat on the railing of the\nspring and looked at me.\n\n\"You're not warmly enough dressed for this kind of thing,\" he remarked.\n\"Where's that gray rabbits' fur, or whatever it is?\"\n\n\"If you mean my chinchillas,\" I said, \"they're in their box. Chinchillas\nare as delicate as babies and not near so plentiful. I'm warm enough.\"\n\n\"You look it.\" He reached over and caught one of my hands. \"Look at\nthat! Blue nails! It's about four degrees above zero here, and while\nthe rest are wrapped in furs and steamer rugs, with hotwater bottles at\ntheir feet, you've got on a shawl. I'll bet you two dollars you haven't\ngot on any--er--winter flannels.\"\n\n\"I never bet,\" I retorted, and went on folding up the steamer rugs.\n\n\"I'd like to help,\" he said, \"but you're so darned capable, Miss\nMinnie--\"\n\n\"You might see if you can get the slot-machine empty,\" I said. \"It's\nfull of water. It wouldn't work and Mr. Moody thought it was frozen.\nHe's been carrying out boiling water all afternoon. If it stays in there\nand freezes the thing will explode.\"\n\nHe wasn't listening. He'd been fussing with his package and now he\nopened it and handed it to me, in the paper.\n\n\"It's a sweater,\" he said, not looking at me. \"I bought it for myself\nand it was too small-- Confound it, Minnie, I wish I could lie! I bought\nthem for you! There's the whole business--sweater, cap, leggings and\nmittens. Go on! Throw them at me!\"\n\nBut I didn't. I looked at them, all white and soft, and it came over\nme suddenly how kind people had been lately, and how much I'd been\ngetting--the old doctor's waistcoat buttons and Miss Pat's furs, and now\nthis! I just buried my face in them and cried.\n\nDoctor Barnes stood by and said nothing. Some men wouldn't have\nunderstood, but he did. After a minute or so he came over and pulled the\nsweater out from the bundle.\n\n\"I'm glad you like 'em,\" he said, \"but as I bought them at Hubbard's, in\nFinleyville, and as the old liar guaranteed they wouldn't shrink, we'd\nbetter not cry on 'em.\"\n\nWell, I put them on and I was warmer and happier than I had been for\nsome time. But that night when I went out to the shelter-house with\nthe supper basket I found both the honeymooners in a wild state of\nexcitement. They said that about five o'clock Thoburn had gone out to\nthe shelter-house and walked all around it. Finally he had stopped at\none of the windows of the other room, had worked at it with his penknife\nand got it open, and crawled through. They sat paralyzed with fright,\nand heard him moving around the other room, and he even tried their\ndoor. But it had been locked. They hadn't the slightest idea what he was\ndoing, but after perhaps ten minutes he went away, going out the door\nthis time and taking the key with him.\n\nMr. Dick had gone in when he was safely gone, but he could see nothing\nunusual, except that the door of the cupboard in the corner was standing\nopen and there was a brand-new, folding, foot rule in it.\n\nThat day the bar was closed for good, and there was a good bit of\nfussing. To add to the trouble, that evening at dinner the pastries\nwere cut off, and at eight o'clock a delegation headed by Senator Biggs\nvisited Mr. Pierce in the office and demanded pastry put back on the\nmenu and the stewed fruit taken off. But Mr. Pierce was firm and they\ncame out pretty well subdued. It was that night, I think, that candles\nwere put in the bedrooms, and all the electric lights were turned off at\nnine-thirty.\n\nAt ten o'clock I took my candle and went to Mr. Pierce's sitting-room\ndoor. I didn't think they'd stand much more and I wanted to tell him so.\nNobody answered and I opened the door. He was asleep, face down on the\nhearth-rug in front of the fire. His candle was lighted on the floor\nbeside him and near it lay a newspaper cutting crumpled in a ball.\nI picked it up. It was a list of the bridal party for Miss Patty's\nwedding.\n\nI dropped it where I found it and went out and knocked again loudly. He\nwakened after a minute and came to the door with the candle in his hand.\n\n\"Oh, it's you, Minnie. Come in!\"\n\nI went in and put my candle on the table.\n\n\"I've got to talk to you,\" I said. \"I don't mind admitting things have\nbeen going pretty well, but--they won't stand for the candles. You mark\nmy words.\"\n\n\"If they'll stand for the bar being closed, why not the candles?\" he\ndemanded.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"they can't have electric light sent up in boxes and\nlabeled 'books,' but they can get liquor that way.\"\n\nHe whistled, and then he laughed.\n\n\"Then we'll not have any books,\" he said. \"I guess they can manage. 'My\nonly books were woman's looks--'\" and then he saw the ball of paper on\nthe floor and his expression changed. He walked over and picked it up,\nsmoothing it out on the palm of his hand.\n\nAfter a minute he looked up at me.\n\n\"I haven't been to the shelter-house to-day. They are all right?\"\n\n\"They're nervous. With everybody walking these days they daren't venture\na nose out of doors.\"\n\nHe was still holding the clipping.\n\n\"And--Miss Jennings!\" he said. \"She--I think she looks better.\"\n\n\"Her father's in a better humor for one thing--says Abraham Lincoln\nsplit logs, and that it beats massage.\"\n\nI had been standing in the doorway, but he took me by the arm and drew\nme into the room.\n\n\"I wish you'd sit down for about ten minutes, Minnie,\" he said. \"I guess\nevery fellow has a time when he's got to tell his troubles to some good\nwoman--not but that you know mine already. You're as shrewd as you are\nkind.\"\n\nI sat down on the edge of a chair. For all I had had so much to do with\nthe sanatorium, I never forgot that I was only the spring-house girl. He\nthrew himself back in his easy chair, with the candle behind him on the\ntable and his arms above his head.\n\n\"It's like this, Minnie,\" he said. \"Mr. Jennings likes the new order of\nthings and--he's going to stay.\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"And I like it here. I want to stay. It's the one thing I've found that\nI think I can do. It isn't what I've dreamed of, but it's worth while.\nTo anchor the derelicts of humanity in a sort of repair dock here, and\nscrape the barnacles off their dispositions, and send them out shipshape\nagain, surely that's something. And I can do it.\"\n\nI nodded again.\n\n\"But if the Jenningses stay--\" he looked at me. \"Minnie, in heaven's\nname, what am I going to do if SHE stays?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Mr. Pierce,\" I said. \"I couldn't sleep last night for\nthinking about it.\"\n\nHe smoothed out the paper and looked at it again, but I think he\nscarcely saw it.\n\n\"The situation is humorous,\" he said, \"only my sense of humor seems\nto have died. She doesn't know I exist, except to invent new and\ntroublesome regulations for her annoyance. She is very sweet when she\nmeets me, but only because I am helping her to have her own way. And\nI--my God, Minnie, I sit in the office and listen for her step outside!\"\n\nHe moved a little and held out the paper in the candle-light.\n\n\"'It will please Americans to know,'\" he read, \"'that with the exception\nof the Venetian lace robe sent by the bridegroom's mother, all of Miss\nPatricia Jennings' elaborate trousseau is being made in America.\n\n\"'Prince Oskar and his suite, according to present arrangements, will\nsail from Naples early in March, and the wedding date, although not yet\ndefinitely fixed, will probably be the first week in April. The wedding\nparty will include--'\"\n\nHe stopped there, and looked at me, trying to smile.\n\n\"I knew it all before,\" he said, \"but there's something inevitable about\nprint. I guess I hadn't realized it.\"\n\nHe had the same look of wretchedness he'd had the first night I saw\nhim--a hungry look--and I couldn't help it; I went over to him and\npatted him on the head like a little boy. I was only the spring-house\ngirl, but I was older than he was, and he needed somebody to comfort\nhim.\n\n\"I can't think of anything to say that will help any,\" I said, \"unless\nit's what you wrote yourself on the blackboard down in the hall, 'Keep\nbusy and you'll keep happy.'\"\n\nHe reached up for my hand, and rough and red as it was--having been in\nthe spring for so many years--he kissed it.\n\n\"Good for you, Minnie!\" he said. \"You're rational, and for a day or so\nI haven't been. That's right, KEEP BUSY. I'll do it.\" He got up and put\nhis hands on my shoulders. \"Good old pal, when you see me going around\nas if all the devils of hell were tormenting me, just come up and say\nthat to me, will you?\"\n\nI promised, and he opened the door, candle in hand, and smiling.\n\n\"I'm a thousand per cent. better already,\" he said. \"I just needed to\ntell somebody, I think. I dare say I've made a lot more fuss than it\nreally deserves.\"\n\nAt the far end of the hall, a girl came out of one room, and carrying\na candle, went across to another. It was Miss Patty, going to bid her\nfather good night. When I left, he was still staring down the hall after\nher, his candle dripping wax on the floor, and his face white. I guess\nhe hadn't overstated his case.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nTHE FIRST FRUITS\n\nBy Friday of that week you would hardly have known any of them. The fat\nones were thinner and the thin ones fatter, and Miss Julia Summers could\nput her whole hand inside her belt.\n\nAnd they were pleasant. They'd sit down to a supper of ham and eggs and\napple sauce, and yell for more apple sauce, and every evening in the\nbilliard room they got up two weighing pools, one for the ones who\nwanted to reduce, and one for the people who wanted to gain. Everybody\nput in a dollar, and at gymnasium hour the next morning the ones who'd\ngained or lost the most won the pool. Mr. Thoburn won the losing pool on\nThursday and Friday--he didn't want to lose weight, but he was compelled\nto under the circumstances. And I think worry helped him to it.\n\nThey fussed some still about sleeping with the windows open, especially\nthe bald-headed men. However, the bishop, who had been bald for thirty\nyears, was getting a fine down all over the top of his head, and this\nencouraged the rest. The bishop says it is nature's instinct to protect\nitself from cold--all animals have fur, and heavier fur in winter--and\nhe believed that it was the ultimate cure for baldness. Men lose their\nhair on top, he said, because they wear hats, and so don't need it.\nBut let the top of the head need protection, and lo, hair comes there.\nAlthough, as Mr. Thoburn said, his nose was always cold in winter, and\nnature never did anything for IT.\n\nMr. von Inwald was still there, and not troubling himself to be\nagreeable to any but the Jennings family. He and Mr. Pierce carefully\navoided each other, but I knew well enough that only policy kept them\napart. Both of them, you see, were working for something.\n\nMiss Cobb came to the spring-house early Friday morning, and from the\nway she came in and shut the door I knew she had something on her mind.\nShe walked over to where I was polishing the brass railing around the\nspring--it had been the habit of years, and not easy to break--and stood\nlooking at me and breathing hard.\n\n\"Minnie,\" she exclaimed, \"I have found the thief!\"\n\n\"Lord have mercy!\" I said, and dropped the brass polish.\n\n\"I have found the thief!\" she repeated firmly. \"Minnie, our sins always\nfind us out.\"\n\n\"I guess they do,\" I said shakily, and sat down on the steps to the\nspring. \"Oh, Miss Cobb, if only he would use a little bit of sense!\"\n\n\"He?\" she said. \"HE nothing! It's that Summers woman I'm talking about,\nMinnie. I knew that woman wasn't what she ought to be the minute I set\neyes on her.\"\n\n\"The Summers woman!\" I repeated.\n\nMiss Cobb leaned over the railing and shook a finger in my face.\n\n\"The Summers woman,\" she said. \"One of the chambermaids found my--my\nPROTECTORS hanging in the creature's closet!\"\n\nI couldn't speak. There had been so much happening that I'd clean\nforgotten Miss Cobb and her woolen tights. And now to have them come\nback like this and hang themselves around my neck, so to speak--it was\ntoo much.\n\n\"Per--perhaps they're hers,\" I said weakly after a minute.\n\n\"Stuff and nonsense!\" declared Miss Cobb. \"Don't you think I know my\nown, with L. C. in white cotton on the band, and my own darning in the\nknee where I slipped on the ice? And more than that, Minnie, where those\ntights are, my letters are!\"\n\nI glanced at the pantry, where her letters were hidden on the upper\nshelf. The door was closed.\n\n\"But--but what would she want with the letters?\" I asked, with my\nteeth fairly hitting together. Miss Cobb pushed her forefinger into my\nshoulder.\n\n\"To blackmail me,\" she said, in a tragic voice, \"or perhaps to publish.\nI've often thought of that myself--they're so beautiful. Letters from\na life insurance agent to his lady-love--interesting, you know, and\nalliterative. As for that woman--!\"\n\n\"What woman!\" said Miss Summers' voice from behind us. We jumped and\nturned. \"I always save myself trouble, so if by any chance you are\ndiscussing me--\"\n\n\"As it happens,\" Miss Cobb said, glaring at her, \"I WAS discussing you.\"\n\n\"Fine!\" said Miss Julia. \"I love to talk about myself.\"\n\n\"I doubt if it's an edifying subject,\" Miss Cobb snapped.\n\nMiss Julia looked at her and smiled.\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" she said, \"but interesting. Don't put yourself out to be\nfriendly to me, Miss Cobb, if you don't feel like it.\"\n\n\"Are you going to return my letters?\" Miss Cobb demanded.\n\n\"Your letters?\"\n\n\"My letters--that you took out of my room!\"\n\n\"Look here,\" Miss Julia said, still in a good humor, \"don't you suppose\nI've got letters of my own, without bothering with another woman's?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Miss Cobb replied in triumph, \"perhaps you will say that you\ndon't know anything of my--of my black woolen protectors?\"\n\n\"Never heard of them!\" said Miss Summers. \"What are they?\" And then she\ncaught my eye, and I guess I looked stricken. \"Oh!\" she said.\n\n\"Miss Cobb was robbed the other night,\" I explained, as quietly as I\ncould. \"Somebody went into her room and took a bundle of letters.\"\n\n\"Letters!\" Miss Summers straightened and looked at me.\n\n\"And my woolen tights,\" said Miss Cobb indignantly, \"with all this cold\nweather and military walks, and having to sit two hours a day by an open\nwindow! And I'll tell you this, Miss Summers, your dog got in my room\nthat night, and while I have no suspicions, the chambermaid found\nmy--er--missing garment this morning in your closet!\"\n\n\"I don't believe,\" Miss Julia said, looking hard at me, \"that Arabella\nwould steal anything so--er--grotesque! Do you mean to say,\" she added\nslowly, \"that nothing was taken from that room but the--lingerie and a\nbundle of letters?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Miss Cobb, \"and I'd thank you for the letters.\"\n\n\"The letters!\" Miss Julia retorted. \"I've never been in your room. I\nhaven't got the letters. I've never seen them.\" Then a light dawned in\nher face. \"I--oh, it's the funniest ever!\"\n\nAnd with that she threw her head back and laughed until the tears rolled\ndown her cheeks and she held her side.\n\n\"Screaming!\" she gasped. \"It's screaming! But, oh, Minnie, to have seen\nyour face!\"\n\nMiss Cobb swept to the door and turned in a fury.\n\n\"I do not think it is funny,\" she stormed, \"and I shall report to Mr.\nCarter at once what I have discovered.\"\n\nShe banged out, and Miss Julia put her head on a card-table and writhed\nwith joy. \"To have seen your face, Minnie!\" she panted, wiping her eyes.\n\"To have thought you had Dick Carter's letters, that I keep rolled\nin asbestos, and then to have opened them and found they were to Miss\nCobb!\"\n\n\"Be as happy as you like,\" I snapped, \"but you are barking up the wrong\ntree. I don't know anything about any letters and as far as that goes,\ndo you think I've lived here fourteen years to get into the wrong room\nat night? If I'd wanted to get into your room, I'd have found your room,\nnot Miss Cobb's.\"\n\nShe sat up and pulled her hat straight, looking me right in the eye.\n\n\"If you'll recall,\" she said, \"I came into the spring-house, and\nArabella pulled that--garment of Miss Cobb's off a table. It was\nearly--nobody was out yet. You were alone, Minnie, or no,\" she said\nsuddenly, \"you were not alone. Minnie, WHO was in the pantry?\"\n\n\"What has that to do with it?\" I managed, with my feet as cold as stone.\n\nShe got up and buttoned her sweater.\n\n\"Don't trouble to lie,\" she said. \"I can see through a stone wall\nas well as most people. Whoever got those letters thought they were\nstealing mine, and there are only two people who would try to steal my\nletters; one is Dick Carter, and the other is his brother-in-law. It\nwasn't Sam in the pantry--he came in just after with his little snip of\na wife.\"\n\n\"Well?\" I managed.\n\nBut she was smiling again, not so pleasantly.\n\n\"I might have known it!\" she said. \"What a fool I've been, Minnie, and\nhow clever you are under that red thatch of yours! Dicky can not appear\nas long as I am here, and Pierce takes his place, and I help to keep the\nsecret and to play the game! Well, I can appreciate a joke on myself as\nwell as most people, but--Minnie, Minnie, think of that guilty wretch of\na Dicky Carter shaking in the pantry!\"\n\n\"I don't know what you are talking about,\" I said, but she only winked\nand went to the door.\n\n\"Don't take it too much to heart,\" she advised. \"Too much loyalty is\na vice, not a virtue. And another piece of advice, Minnie--when I find\nDicky Carter, stand from under; something will fall.\"\n\nThey had charades during the rest hour that afternoon, the overweights\nheaded by the bishop, against the underweights headed by Mr. Moody. They\nselected their words from one of Horace Fletcher's books, and as Mr.\nPierce wasn't either over or underweight, they asked him to be referee.\n\nOh, they were crazy about him by that time. It was \"Mr. Carter\" here and\n\"dear Mr. Carter\" there, with the women knitting him neckties and the\nmen coming up to be bullied and asking for more.\n\nAnd he kept the upper hand, too, once he got it. It was that day, I\nthink, that he sent Senator Biggs up to make his bed again, and nobody\nin the place will ever forget how he made old Mr. Jennings hang his\ngymnasium suit up three times before it was done properly. The old man\nwas mad enough at the time, but inside of twenty minutes he was offering\nMr. Pierce the cigar he'd won in the wood-chopping contest.\n\nBut if Mr. Pierce was making a hit with the guests, he wasn't so popular\nwith the Van Alstynes or the Carters. The night the cigar stand was\nclosed Mr. Sam came to me and leaned over the counter.\n\n\"Put the key in a drawer,\" he said. \"I can slip down here after the\nlights are out and get a smoke.\"\n\n\"Can't do it, Mr. Van Alstyne,\" I said. \"Got positive orders.\"\n\n\"That doesn't include me.\" He was still perfectly good-humored.\n\n\"Sorry,\" I said. \"Have to have a written order from Mr. Pierce.\"\n\nHe put a silver dollar on the desk between us and looked at me over it.\n\n\"Will that open the case?\" he asked. But I shook my head.\n\n\"Well, I'll be hanged! What the devil sort of order did he give you?\"\n\n\"He said,\" I repeated, \"that I'd be coaxed and probably bribed to open\nthe cigar case, and that you'd probably be the first one to do it, but\nI was to stick firm; you've been smoking too much, and your nerves are\ngoing.\"\n\n\"Insolent young puppy!\" he exclaimed angrily, and stamped away.\n\nSo that I was not surprised when on that night, Friday, I was told to be\nat the shelter-house at ten o'clock for a protest meeting. Mrs. Sam told\nme.\n\n\"Something has to be done,\" she said. \"I don't intend to stand much\nmore. Nobody has the right to say when I shall eat or what. If I want to\neat fried shoe leather, that's my affair.\"\n\nWe met at ten o'clock at the shelter-house, everybody having gone to\nbed--Miss Patty, the Van Alstynes and myself. The Dickys were on good\nterms again, for a wonder, and when we went in they were in front of the\nfire, she on a box and he at her feet, with his head buried in her lap.\nHe didn't even look up when we entered.\n\n\"They're here, Dicky,\" she said.\n\n\"All right!\" he answered in a smothered voice. \"How many of 'em?\"\n\n\"Four,\" she said, and kissed the tip of his ear.\n\n\"For goodness sake, Dick!\" Mrs. Sam snapped in a disgusted tone, \"stop\nthat spooning and get us something to sit on.\"\n\n\"Help yourself,\" he replied, still from his wife's lap, \"and don't be\njealous, sis. If the sight of married happiness upsets you, go away. Go\naway, anyhow.\"\n\nMr. Sam came over and jerked him into a sitting position. \"Either you'll\nsit up and take part in this discussion,\" he said angrily, \"or you'll go\nout in the snow until it's over.\"\n\nMr. Dick leaned over and kissed his wife's hand.\n\n\"A cruel fate is separating us,\" he explained, \"but try to endure it\nuntil I return. I'll be on the other side of the fireplace.\"\n\nMiss Patty came to the fire and stood warming her hands. I saw her\nsister watching her.\n\n\"What's wrong with you, Pat?\" she asked. \"Oskar not behaving?\"\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" Miss Patty said. \"I'm all right.\"\n\n\"She's worked to death,\" Mrs. Sam put in. \"Look at all of us. I'll tell\nyou I'm so tired these nights that by nine o'clock I'm asleep on my\nfeet.\"\n\n\"I'm tired to death, but I don't sleep,\" Miss Patty said. \"I--I don't\nknow why.\"\n\n\"I do,\" her sister said. \"If you weren't so haughty, Pat, and would just\nown up that you're sick of your bargain--\"\n\n\"Dolly!\" Miss Patty got red and then white.\n\n\"Oh, all right,\" Mrs. Dicky said, and shrugged her shoulders. \"Only, I\nhate to see you make an idiot of yourself, when I'm so happy.\"\n\nMr. Dick made a move at that to go across the fireplace to her, but Mr.\nSam pushed him back where he was.\n\n\"You stay right there,\" he said. \"Here's Pierce now.\"\n\nHe came in smiling, and as he stood inside the door, brushing the snow\noff, it was queer to see how his eyes went around the circle until he'd\nfound Miss Patty and stopped at her.\n\nNobody answered his smile, and he came over to the fire beside Miss\nPatty.\n\n\"Great night!\" he said, looking down at her. \"There's something\ninvigorating in just breathing that wind.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" Mrs. Sam said disagreeably. \"Of course, we haven't\nall got your shoulders.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" he answered, turning to her. \"I said you women should not\ncome so far. We could have met in my sitting-room.\"\n\n\"You forget one thing,\" Mr. Dick put in disagreeably, \"and that is\nthat this meeting concerns me, and I can not very well go to YOUR\nsitting-room.\"\n\n\"Fact,\" said Mr. Pierce, \"I'd forgotten about you for the moment.\"\n\n\"You generally do,\" Mr. Dick retorted. \"If you want the truth, Pierce,\nI'm about tired of your high-handed methods.\"\n\nMr. Pierce set his jaw and looked down at him.\n\n\"Why? I've saved the place, haven't I? Why, look here,\" he said, and\npulled out a couple of letters, \"these are the first fruits of those\nthat weep--in other words, per aspera ad astra! Two new guests coming\nthe last of the week--want to be put in training!\"\n\nWell, that was an argument nobody could find fault with, but their\ngrievance was about themselves and they couldn't forgive him. They\nturned on him in the most heartless way--even Miss Patty--and demanded\nthat he give them special privileges--breakfast when they wanted it, and\nMr. Sam the key to the bar. And he stood firm, as he had that day in the\nlobby, and let the storm beat around him, looking mostly at Miss Patty.\nIt was more than I could bear.\n\n\"Shame on all of you!\" I said. \"He's done what he promised he'd do, and\nmore. If he did what he ought, he'd leave this minute, and let you find\nout for yourself what it is to drive thirty-odd different stomachs and\nthe same number of bad dispositions in one direction.\"\n\n\"You are perfectly right, Minnie,\" Miss Patty said. \"We're beastly,\nall of us, and I'm sorry.\" She went over and held out her hand to him.\n\"You've done the impossible,\" she told him. He beamed.\n\n\"Your approval means more than anything,\" he said, holding her hand.\nMrs. Dick sat up and opened her eyes wide.\n\n\"Speaking of Oskar,\" she began, and then stopped, staring past her\nsister, toward the door.\n\nWe all turned, and there, blinking in the light, was Miss Summers.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nOVER THE FENCE IS OUT\n\n\"WELL!\" she said, and stood staring. Then she smiled--I guess our faces\nwere funny.\n\n\"May I come in?\" she asked, and without waiting she came in and closed\nthe door. \"You DO look cozy!\" she said, and shook herself free of snow.\n\nMr. Dick had turned white. He got up with his eyes on her, and twice he\nopened his mouth and couldn't speak. He backed, still watching her, to\nhis wife, and stood in front of her, as if to protect her.\n\nMr. Sam got his voice first.\n\n\"B--bad night for a walk,\" he said.\n\n\"Frightful!\" she said. \"I've been buried to my knees. May I sit down?\"\nTo those of us who knew, her easy manner had something horrible in it.\n\n\"Sorry there are no chairs, Julia,\" Mr. Pierce said. \"Sit on the cot,\nwon't you?\"\n\n\"Who IS it?\" Mrs. Dick asked from, as you may say, her eclipse. She and\nMiss Summers were the only calm ones in the room.\n\n\"I--I don't know,\" Mr. Dick stammered, but the next moment Miss Julia,\nfrom the cot, looked across at him and grinned.\n\n\"Well, Dicky!\" she said. \"Who'd have thought it!\"\n\n\"You said you didn't know her!\" his wife said from behind him.\n\n\"Who'd have thought wha--what?\" he asked with bravado.\n\n\"All this!\" Miss Julia waved her hand around the room, with its bare\nwalls, and blankets over the windows to keep the light in and the cold\nout, and the circle of us sitting around on sand boxes from the links\nand lawn rollers. \"To find you here, all snug in your own home, with\nyour household gods and a wife.\" Nobody could think of anything to say.\n\"That is,\" she went on, \"I believe there is a wife. Good heavens, Dicky,\nit isn't Minnie?\"\n\nHe stepped aside at that, disclosing Mrs. Dick on her box, with her\nchildish eyes wide open.\n\n\"There--there IS a wife, Julia,\" he said. \"This is her--she.\"\n\nWell, she'd come out to make mischief--it was written all over her when\nshe came in the door, but when Mr. Dick presented his wife, frightened\nas he was and still proud of her, and Mrs. Dick smiled in her pretty\nway, Miss Summers just walked across and looked down at her with a queer\nlook on her face. I shut my eyes and waited for the crash, but nothing\ncame, and when I opened them again there were the two women holding\nhands and Miss Summers smiling a sort of crooked grin at Mr. Dick.\n\n\"I ought to be very angry with your husband,\" she said. \"I--well, I\nnever expected him to marry without my being among those present. But\nsince he has done it--! Dick, you wretched boy, you took advantage of my\nbeing laid up with the mumps!\"\n\n\"Mumps!\" Mrs. Dick said. \"Why, he has just had them himself!\" She looked\naround the circle suspiciously, and every one of us looked as guilty as\nif he had been caught with the mumps concealed around him somewhere.\n\n\"I didn't have real mumps,\" Mr. Dick explained. \"It was only--er--a\nswelling.\"\n\n\"You SAID it was mumps, and even now you hate pickles!\"\n\nMr. Pierce had edged over to Miss Summers and patted her shoulder.\n\n\"Be a good sport, Julia,\" he whispered.\n\nShe threw off his hand.\n\n\"I'm being an idiot!\" she said angrily. \"Dick's an ass, and he's treated\nme like a villain, but look at that baby! It will be twenty years before\nshe has to worry about her weight.\"\n\n\"I never cared for pickles,\" Mr. Dick was saying with dignity. \"The\ndoctor said--\"\n\n\"I think we'd better be going.\" Miss Patty got up and gathered up her\ncloak. But if she meant to break up the party Miss Summers was not\nready.\n\n\"If you don't mind,\" she said, \"I'll stay. I'm frozen, and I've got to\ngo home and sleep with my window up. You're lucky,\" she went on to the\nDickys. \"I dare say the air in here would scare us under a microscope,\nbut at least it is warm.\"\n\nThe Van Alstynes made a move to go, but Mr. Dicky frantically gestured\nto them not to leave him alone, and Mrs. Sam sat down again sulkily. Mr.\nPierce picked up his cap.\n\n\"I'll take you back,\" he said to Miss Patty, and his face was fairly\nglowing. But Miss Patty slipped her arm through mine.\n\n\"Come, Minnie, Mr. Pierce is going to take us,\" she said.\n\n\"I'd--I'd rather go alone,\" I said.\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"I'm not ready. I've got to gather up these dishes,\" I objected.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye I could see the glow dying out of Mr.\nPierce's face. But Miss Patty took my arm and led me to the door.\n\n\"Let them gather up their own dishes,\" she said. \"Dolly, you ought to be\nashamed to let Minnie slave for you the way she does. Good night,\neverybody.\"\n\nI did my best to leave them alone on the way back, but Miss Patty stuck\nclose to my heels. It was snowing, and the going was slow.\n\nFor the first five minutes she only spoke once.\n\n\"And so Miss Summers and Dicky Carter are old friends!\"\n\n\"It appears so,\" Mr. Pierce said.\n\n\"She's rather magnanimous, under the circumstances,\" Miss Patty remarked\ndemurely.\n\n\"Under what circumstances?\"\n\nI heard her laugh a little, behind me.\n\n\"Never mind,\" she said. \"You needn't tell me anything you don't care to.\nBut what a stew you must all have been in!\"\n\nThere was a minute's silence behind me, and then Mr. Pierce laughed too.\n\n\"Stew!\" he said. \"For the last few days I've been either paralyzed\nwith fright or electrified into wild bursts of mendacity. And I'm not\nnaturally a liar.\"\n\n\"Really!\" she retorted. \"What an actor you are!\"\n\nThey laughed together at that, and I gained a little on them. At the\ncorner where the path skirted the deer park and turned toward the house\nI lost them altogether and I floundered on alone. But I had not gone\ntwenty feet when I stopped suddenly. About fifty yards ahead a lantern\nwas coming toward me through the snow, and I could hear a man's voice,\nbreathless and gasping.\n\n\"Set it down,\" it said. \"The damned thing must be filled with lead.\" It\nsounded like Thoburn.\n\n\"It's the snow,\" another voice replied, Mr. von Inwald's. \"I told you it\nwould take two trips.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Thoburn retorted, breathing in groans. \"Stay up all night to get\nthe blamed stuff here, and then get up at dawn for a cold bath and\na twenty-mile walk and an apple for breakfast. Ugh, my shoulder is\ndislocated.\"\n\nI turned and flew back to Miss Patty and Pierce. They had stopped in the\nshelter of the fence corner and Mr. Pierce was on his knees in front of\nher! I was so astounded that I forgot for the moment what had brought\nme.\n\n\"Just a second,\" he was saying. \"It's ice on the heel.\"\n\n\"Please get up off your knees, you'll take cold.\"\n\n\"Never had a cold. I'll scrape it off with my knife. Why don't you wear\novershoes?\"\n\n\"I never have a cold!\" she retorted. \"Why, Minnie, is that you?\"\n\n\"Quick,\" I panted. \"Thoburn and Mr. von Inwald\ncoming--basket--lantern--warn the shelter-house!\"\n\n\"Great Scott!\" Mr. Pierce said. \"Here, you girls crawl over the fence:\nyou'll be hidden there. I'll run back and warn them.\"\n\nThe lantern was swinging again. Mr. Thoburn's grumbling came to us\nthrough the snow, monotonous and steady.\n\n\"I can't climb the fence!\" Miss Patty said pitifully. But Mr. Pierce had\ngone.\n\nI reached my basket through the bars and climbed the fence in a hurry.\nMiss Patty had got almost to the top and was standing there on one\nsnow-covered rail, staring across at me through the darkness.\n\n\"I can't, Minnie,\" she whispered hopelessly. \"I never could climb a\nfence, and in this skirt--!\"\n\n\"Quick!\" I said in a low tone. The lantern was very close. \"Put your leg\nover.\"\n\nShe did, and sat there looking down at me like a scared baby.\n\n\"Now the other.\"\n\n\"I--I can't!\" she whispered. \"If I put them both over I'll fall.\"\n\n\"Hurry!\"\n\nWith a little grunt she put the other foot over, sat a minute with\nagony in her face and her arms out, then she slid off with a squeal\nand brought up in a sitting position inside the fence corner. I dropped\nbeside her.\n\n\"What was that noise?\" said Mr. Thoburn, almost upon us. \"Something's\nmoving inside that fence corner.\"\n\n\"It's them deers,\" Mike's voice this time. We could make out the three\nfigures. \"Darned nuisance, them deers is. They'd have been shot long\nago if the spring-house girl hadn't objected. She thinks she's the whole\ncheese around here.\"\n\n\"Set it down again,\" Mr. von Inwald panted. We heard the rattle of\nbottles as they put down the basket, and the next instant Thoburn's fat\nhand was resting on the rail of the fence over our heads. I could feel\nMiss Patty trembling beside me.\n\nBut he didn't look over. He stood there resting, breathing hard, and\nswearing at the weather, while Mike waited, in surly silence, and the\nvon Inwald cursed in German.\n\nAfter my heart had been beating in my ears for about three years the fat\nhand moved, and I heard the rattle of glass again and Thoburn's groan as\nhe bent over his half of the load.\n\n     \"'Come on, my partners in distress,\n     My comrades through this wilderness,'\"\n\nhe said, and the others grunted and started on.\n\nWhen they had disappeared in the snow we got out of our cramped position\nand prepared to scurry home. I climbed the fence and looked after them.\n\"Humph!\" I said, \"I guess that basket isn't for the hungry poor. I'd\ngive a good bit to know--\" Then I turned and looked for Miss Patty. She\nwas flat on the snow, crawling between the two lower rails of the fence.\n\n\"Have you no shame?\" I demanded.\n\nShe looked up at me with her head and half her long sealskin coat\nthrough the fence.\n\n\"None,\" she said pitifully. \"Minnie, I'm stuck perfectly tight!\"\n\n\"You ought to be left as you are,\" I said, jerking at her, \"for people\nto come\"--jerk--\"to-morrow to look at\"--jerk. She came through at that,\nand we lay together in the snow and like to burst a rib laughing.\n\n\"You'll never be a princess, Miss Patty,\" I declared. \"You're too lowly\nminded.\"\n\nShe sat up suddenly and straightened her sealskin cap on her head.\n\n\"I wish,\" she said unpleasantly, \"I wish you wouldn't always drag in\ndisagreeable things, Minnie!\"\n\nAnd she was sulky all the way to the house.\n\nMiss Summers came to my room that night as I was putting my hot-water\nbottle to bed, in a baby-blue silk wrapper with a band of fur around the\nlow neck--Miss Summers, of course, not the hot-water bottle.\n\n\"Well!\" she said, sitting down on the foot of the bed and staring at me.\n\"Well, young woman, for a person who has never been farther away than\nFinleyville you do pretty well!\"\n\n\"Do what?\" I asked, with the covers up to my chin.\n\n\"Do what, Miss Innocence!\" she said mockingly. \"You're the only\nred-haired woman I ever saw who didn't look as sophisticated as the\ndevil. I'll tell you one thing, though.\" She reached down into the\npocket of her dressing-gown and brought up a cigarette and a match. \"You\nnever had me fooled for a minute!\" She looked at me over the match.\n\nI lay and stared back.\n\n\"And another thing,\" she said. \"I never had any real intention of\nmarrying Dicky Carter and raising a baby sanatorium. I wouldn't have the\nface to ask Arabella to live here.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you feel that way, Miss Summers,\" I said. \"I've gone through a\nlot; I'm an old woman in the last two weeks. My hair's falling from its\nhaving to stand up on end half the time.\"\n\nShe leaned over and put her cigarette on the back of my celluloid\nmirror, and then suddenly she threw back her head and laughed.\n\n\"Minnie!\" she said, between fits, \"Minnie! As long as I live I'll never\nforget that wretched boy's face! And the sand boxes! And the blankets\nover the windows! And the tarpaulin over the rafters! And Mr. Van\nAlstyne sitting on the lawnmower! I'd rather have had my minute in that\ndoorway than fifty thousand dollars!\"\n\n\"If you had had to carry out all those things--\" I began, but she\nchecked me.\n\n\"Listen!\" she said. \"Somebody with brains has got to take you young\npeople in hand. You're not able to look after yourselves. I'm fond of\nAlan Pierce, for one thing, and I don't care to see a sanatorium that\nmight have been the child of my solicitude kidnaped and reared as a\nsummer hotel by Papa Thoburn. A good fat man is very, very good, Minnie,\nbut when he is bad he is horrid.\"\n\n\"It's too late,\" I objected feebly. \"He can't get it now.\"\n\n\"Can't he!\" She got up and yawned, stretching. \"Well, I'll lay you\nten to one that if we don't get busy he'll have the house empty in\nthirty-six hours, and a bill of sale on it in as many days.\"\n\nThe celluloid mirror blazed up at that minute, and she poured the\ncontents of my water-pitcher over the dresser. For the next hour, while\nI was emptying water out of the bureau drawers and hanging up my clothes\nto dry, she told me what she knew of Thoburn's scheme, and it turned me\ncold.\n\nBut I went to bed finally. Just as I was dozing off, somebody opened my\ndoor, and I heard a curious scraping along the floor. I turned on the\nlight, and there was Arabella, half-dragging and half-carrying a solid\nsilver hand-mirror with a card on it: \"To Minnie, to replace the one\nthat blew up. J. S.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nA CUPBOARD FULL OF RYE\n\nDoctor Barnes came to me at the news stand the next morning before\ngymnasium.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"you look as busy as a dog with fleas. Have you heard\nthe glad tidings?\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked without much spirit. \"I've heard considerable tidings\nlately, and not much of it has cheered me up any.\"\n\nHe leaned over and ran his fingers up through his hair.\n\n\"You know, Miss Minnie,\" he said, \"somebody ought kindly to kill our\nfriend Thoburn, or he'll come to a bad end.\"\n\n\"Shall I do it, or will you?\" I said, filling up the chewing-gum jar.\n(Mr. Pierce had taken away the candy case.)\n\nDoctor Barnes glanced around to see if there was any one near, and\nleaned farther over.\n\n\"The cupboard isn't empty now!\" he said. \"Not for nothing did I spend\npart of the night in the Dicky-bird's nest! By the way, did you ever\nhear that touching story about little Sally walking up and laying an\negg?--I see you have. What do you think is in the cupboard?\"\n\n\"I know about it,\" I said shortly. \"Liquor--in a case labeled\n'Books--breakable.'\"\n\n\"'Sing a song of sixpence, a cupboard full of rye!'\" he said. \"Almost\na goal! But not ONLY liquors, my little friend. Champagne--cases of\nit--caviar, canned grouse with truffles, lobster, cheeses, fine cigars,\neverything you could think of, erotic, exotic and narcotic. An orgy in\ncans and bottles, a bacchanalian revel: a cupboard full of indigestion,\njoy, forgetfulness and katzenjammer. Oh, my suffering palate, to have to\nleave it all without one sniff, one sip, one nibble!\"\n\n\"He's wasting his money,\" I said. \"They're all crazy about the simple\nlife.\"\n\nHe looked around and, seeing no one in the lobby, reached over and took\none of my hands.\n\n\"Strange,\" he said, looking at it. \"No webs, and yet it's been an\namphibious little creature most of its life. My dear girl, our\nfriend Thoburn is a rascal, but he is also a student of mankind and a\nphilosopher. Gee,\" he said, \"think of a woman fighting her way alone\nthrough the world with a bit of a fist like that!\"\n\nI jerked my hand away.\n\n\"It's like this, my dear,\" he said. \"Human nature's a curious thing.\nIt's human nature, for instance, for me to be crazy about you, when\nyou're as hands-offish as a curly porcupine. And it is human nature, by\nthe same token, to like to be bullied, especially about health, and to\nrespect and admire the fellow who does the bullying. That's why we were\ncrazy about Roosevelt, and that's why Pierce is trailing his kingly\nrobes over them while they lie on their faces and eat dirt--and stewed\nfruit.\"\n\nHe reached for my hand again, but I put it behind me.\n\n\"But alas,\" he said, \"there is another side to human nature, and\nour friend Thoburn has not kept a summer hotel for nothing. It is\nnotoriously weak, especially as to stomach. You may feed 'em prunes and\nwhole-wheat bread and apple sauce, and after a while they'll forget\nthe fat days, and remember only the lean and hungry ones. But let some\nstudent of human nature at the proper moment introduce just one fat day,\none feast, one revel--\"\n\n\"Talk English,\" I said sharply.\n\n\"Don't break in on my flights of fancy,\" he objected. \"If you want the\ntruth, Thoburn is going to have a party--a forbidden feast. He's going\nto rouse again the sleeping dogs of appetite, and send them ravening\nback to the Plaza, to Sherry's and Del's and the little Italian\nrestaurants on Sixth Avenue. He's going to take them up on a high\nmountain and show them the wines and delicatessen of the earth, and\nthen ask them if they're going to be bullied into eating boiled beef and\ncabbage.\"\n\n\"Then I don't care how soon he does it,\" I said despondently. \"I'd\nrather die quickly than by inches.\"\n\n\"Die!\" he said. \"Not a bit of it. Remember, our friend Pierce is also\na student of human nature. He's thinking it out now in the cold plunge,\nand I miss my guess if Thoburn's sky-rocket hasn't got a stick that'll\ncome back and hit him on the head.\"\n\nHe had been playing with one of the chewing-gum jars, and when he had\ngone I shoved it back into its place. It was by the merest chance that I\nglanced at it, and I saw that he had slipped a small white box inside. I\nknew I was being a silly old fool, but my heart beat fast when I took\nit out and looked at it. On the lid was written \"For a good girl,\" and\ninside lay the red puffs from Mrs. Yost's window down in Finleyville.\nJust under them was an envelope. I could scarcely see to open it.\n\n\n\"Dearest Minnie,\" the note inside said, \"I had them matched to my own\nthatch, and I think they'll match yours. And since, in the words of\nthe great Herbert Spencer, things that match the same thing match each\nother--! What do you say?--Barnes.\"\n\n\"P. S.--I love you. I feel like a damn fool saying it, but heaven knows\nit's true.\"\n\n\"P. P. S.--Still love you. It's easier the second time.\"\n\n\"N. B.--I love you--got the habit now and can't stop writing it.--B.\"\n\n\nWell, I had to keep calm and attend to business, but I was seething\ninside like a Seidlitz powder. Every few minutes I'd reread the letter\nunder the edge of the stand, and the more I read it the more excited\nI got. When a woman's gone past thirty before she gets her first\nlove-letter, she isn't sure whether to thank providence or the man, but\nshe's pretty sure to make a fool of herself.\n\nThoburn came to the news stand on his way out with the ice-cutting gang\nto the pond.\n\n\"Last call to the dining-car, Minnie,\" he said. \"'Will you--won't\nyou--will you--won't you--will you join the dance?'\"\n\n\"I haven't any reason for changing my plans,\" I retorted. \"I promised\nthe old doctor to stick by the place, and I'm sticking.\"\n\n\"As the man said when he sat down on the flypaper. You're going by your\nheart, Minnie, and not by your head, and in this toss, heads win.\"\n\nBut with my new puffs on the back of my head, and my letter in my\npocket, I wasn't easy to discourage. Thoburn shouldered his pick and,\nheaded by Doctor Barnes, the ice-cutters started out in single file.\nAs they passed the news stand Doctor Barnes glanced at me, and my heart\nalmost stopped.\n\n\"Do they--is it a match?\" he asked, with his eyes on mine.\n\nI couldn't speak, but I nodded \"yes,\" and all that afternoon I could\nsee the wonderful smile that lit up his face as he went out. It made him\nalmost good-looking. Oh, there's nothing like love, especially if you've\nwaited long enough to be hungry for it, and not spoiled your taste for\nit by a bite here and a piece of a heart there, beforehand, so to speak.\n\nMiss Cobb stopped at the news stand on her way to the gymnasium. She\nwas a homely woman at any time, and in her bloomers she looked like a\nsoup-bone. Under ordinary circumstances she'd have seen the puffs from\nthe staircase and have asked what they cost and told me they didn't\nmatch, in one breath. But she had something else on her mind. She padded\nover to the counter in her gym shoes, and for once she'd forgotten her\nlegs.\n\n\"May I speak to you, Minnie?\" she asked.\n\n\"You mostly do,\" I said. \"There isn't a new rule about speaking, is\nthere?\"\n\n\"This is important, Minnie,\" she said, rolling her eyes around as she\nalways did when she was excited. \"I'm in such a state of ex--I see you\nbought the puffs! Perhaps you will lend them to me if we arrange for a\ncountry dance.\"\n\n\"They don't match,\" I objected. \"They--they wouldn't look natural, Miss\nCobb.\"\n\n\"They don't look natural on you, either. Do you suppose anybody believes\nthat the Lord sent you hair in seventeen rows of pipes, so that, red as\nit is, it looks like an instantaneous water-heater?\"\n\n\"I'm not lending them,\" I said firmly. It would have been like lending\nan engagement ring, to my mind. Miss Cobb was not offended. She went at\nonce to what had brought her, and bent over the counter.\n\n\"Where's the Summers woman?\" she asked.\n\n\"In the gym. She's made herself a new gym suit out of her polka dotted\nsilk, and she looks lovely.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" retorted Miss Cobb. \"Minnie, you love Miss Jennings almost like\na daughter, don't you?\"\n\n\"Like a sister, Miss Cobb,\" I said. \"I'm not feeble yet.\"\n\n\"Well, you wouldn't want to see her deceived.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't have it,\" I answered.\n\n\"Then what do you call this?\" She put a small package on the counter,\nand stared at me over it. \"There's treachery here, black treachery.\" She\npointed one long thin forefinger at the bundle.\n\n\"What is it? A bomb?\" I asked, stepping back. More than once it had\noccurred to me that having royalty around sometimes meant dynamite. Miss\nCobb showed her teeth.\n\n\"Yes, a bomb,\" she said. \"Minnie, since that creature took my letters\nand my er--protectors, I have suspected her. Now listen. Yesterday I\nwent over the letters and I missed one that beautiful one in verse,\nbeginning, 'Oh, creature of the slender form and face!' Minnie, it had\ndisappeared--melted away.\"\n\n\"I'm not surprised,\" I said.\n\n\"And so, last night, when the Summers woman was out, goodness knows\nwhere, Blanche Moody and I went through her room. We did not find my\nprecious missive from Mr. Jones, but we did find these, Minnie, tied\naround with a pink silk stocking.\"\n\n\"Heavens!\" I said, mockingly. \"Not a pink silk!\"\n\n\"Pink,\" she repeated solemnly. \"Minnie, I have felt it all along. Mr.\nOskar von Inwald is the prince himself.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Yes. And more than that, he is making desperate love to Miss Summers.\nThree of those letters were written in one day! Why, even Mr. Jones--\"\n\n\"The wretch!\" I cried. I was suddenly savage. I wanted to take Mr. von\nInwald by the throat and choke him until his lying tongue was black, to\nput the letters where Miss Patty could never see them. I wanted--I had\nto stop to sell Senator Biggs some chewing-gum, and when he had gone,\nMiss Cobb was reaching out for the bundle. I snatched it from her.\n\n\"Give me those letters instantly,\" she cried shrilly. But I marched from\nbehind the counter and over to the fireplace.\n\n\"Never,\" I said, and put the package on the log. When they were safely\nblazing, I turned and looked at Miss Cobb.\n\n\"I'd put my hand right beside those letters to save Miss Patty a\nheartache,\" I said, \"and you know it.\"\n\n\"You're a fool.\" She was raging. \"You'll let her marry him and have the\nheartaches afterward.\"\n\n\"She won't marry him,\" I snapped, and walked away with my chin up,\nleaving her staring.\n\nBut I wasn't so sure as I pretended to be. Mr. von Inwald and Mr.\nJennings had been closeted together most of the morning, and Mr. von\nInwald was whistling as he started out for the military walk. It seemed\nas if the very thing that had given Mr. Pierce his chance to make good\nhad improved Mr. Jennings' disposition enough to remove the last barrier\nto Miss Jennings' wedding with somebody else.\n\nWell, what's one man's meat is another man's poison.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nLOVE, LOVE, LOVE\n\nEven if we hadn't known, we'd have guessed there was something in the\nair. There was an air of subdued excitement during the rest hour in the\nspring-house, and a good bit of whispering and laughing, in groups which\nwould break up with faces as long as the moral law the moment they saw\nmy eye on them.\n\nThey were planning a mutiny, as you may say, and I guess no sailors on a\npirate ship were more afraid of the captain's fist than they were of Mr.\nPierce's disapproval. He'd been smart enough to see that most of them,\nhaving bullied other people all their lives, liked the novelty of being\nbullied themselves. And now they were getting a new thrill by having a\nrevolt. They were terribly worked up.\n\nMiss Patty stayed after the others had gone, sitting in front of the\nempty fireplace in the same chair Mr. Pierce usually took, and keeping\nher back to me. When I'd finished folding the steamer rugs and putting\nthem away, I went around and stood in front of her.\n\n\"Your eyes are red,\" I remarked.\n\n\"I've got a cold.\" She was very haughty.\n\n\"Your nose isn't red,\" I insisted. \"And, anyhow, you say you never have\na cold.\"\n\n\"I wish you would let me alone, Minnie.\" She turned her back to me. \"I\ndare say I may have a cold if I wish.\"\n\n\"Do you know what they are saying here?\" I demanded. \"Do you know that\nMiss Cobb has found out in some way or other who Mr. von Inwald is?\nAnd that the four o'clock gossip edition says your father has given his\nconsent and that you can go and buy a diadem or whatever you are going\nto wear, right off?\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said, in a choked voice, with her back to me, \"what of it?\nDidn't you and Mr. Pierce both do your best to bring it about?\"\n\n\"Our what?\" I couldn't believe my ears.\n\n\"You made father well. He's so p--pleasant he'll do anything except\nleave this awful place!\"\n\n\"Well, of all the ungrateful people--\" I began, and then Mr. Pierce came\nin. He had a curious way of stopping when he saw her, as if she just\ntook the wind out of his sails, so to speak, and then of whipping off\nhis hat, if anything with sails can wear a hat, and going up to her\nwith his heart in his eyes. He always went straight to her and stopped\nsuddenly about two feet away, trying to think of something ordinary to\nsay. Because the extraordinary thing he wanted to say was always on the\nend of his tongue.\n\nBut this day he didn't light up when he saw her. He went through all\nthe other motions, but his mouth was set in a straight line, and when he\ncame close to her and looked down his eyes were hard.\n\nIt's been my experience of men that the younger they are the harder they\ntake things and the more uncompromising they are. It takes a good many\nyears and some pretty hard knocks to make people tolerant.\n\n\"I was looking for you,\" he said to her. \"The bishop has just told me.\nThere are no obstacles now.\"\n\n\"None,\" she said, looking up at him with wretchedness in her eyes, if he\nhad only seen. \"I am very happy.\"\n\n\"She was just saying,\" I said bitterly, \"how grateful she was to both of\nus.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"It is not hard to understand,\" she said, smiling. I wanted to slap her.\n\"Father was unreasonable because he was ill. You have made him well. I\ncan never thank you enough.\"\n\nBut she rather overdid the joy part of it, and he leaned over and looked\nin her face.\n\n\"I think I'm stupid,\" he said. \"I know I'm unhappy. But isn't that what\nI was to do--to make them well if I could?\"\n\n\"How could anybody know--\" she began angrily, and then stopped. \"You\nhave done even more,\" she said sweetly. \"You've turned them into\ncherubims and seraphims. Butter wouldn't melt in their mouths. Ugh! How\nI hate amiability raised to the NTH power!\"\n\nHe smiled. I think it was getting through his thick man's skull that she\nwasn't so happy as she should have been, and he was thrilled through and\nthrough.\n\n\"My amiability must be the reason you dislike me!\" he suggested. They\nhad both forgotten me.\n\n\"Do I dislike you?\" she asked, raising her eyebrows. \"I never really\nthought about it, but I'm sure I don't.\" She didn't look at him, she\nlooked at me. She knew I knew she lied.\n\nHis smile faded.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"speaking of disliking amiability, you don't hate\nyourself, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"You are wrong,\" she retorted, \"I loathe myself.\" And she walked to the\nwindow. He took a step or two after her.\n\n\"Why do it at all?\" he asked in a low tone. \"You don't love him--you\ncan't. And if it isn't love--\" He remembered me suddenly and stopped.\n\n\"Please go on,\" she said sweetly from the window. \"Do not mind Minnie.\nShe is my conscience, anyhow. She is always scolding me; you might both\nscold in chorus.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't presume to scold.\"\n\n\"Then give me a little advice and look superior and righteous. I'm\naccustomed to that also.\"\n\n\"As long as you are in this mood, I can't give you anything but a very\ngood day,\" he said angrily, and went toward the door. But when he had\nalmost reached it he turned.\n\n\"I will say this,\" he said, \"you have known for three days that Mr.\nThoburn was going to have a supper to-night, and you didn't let us know.\nYou must have known his purpose.\"\n\nI guess I was as surprised as she was. I'd never suspected she knew.\n\nShe looked at him over her shoulder.\n\n\"Why shouldn't he have a supper?\" she demanded angrily. \"I'm\nstarving--we're all starving for decent food. I'm kept here against my\nwill. Why shouldn't I have one respectable meal? You with your wretched\nstewed fruits and whole-wheat breads! Ugh!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. Thoburn's idea, of course, is to make the guests\ndiscontented, so they will leave.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she said. She hadn't thought of that, and she flushed. \"At least,\"\nshe said, \"you must give me credit for not trying to spoil Dick and\nDolly's chance here.\"\n\n\"We are going to allow the party to go on,\" he said, still stiff and\nuncompromising. It would have been better if he'd accepted her bit of\napology.\n\n\"How kind of you! I dare say he would have it, anyhow.\" She was\nsarcastic again.\n\n\"Probably. And you--will go?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Even when the result--\"\n\n\"Oh, don't preach!\" she said, putting her hands to her ears. \"If you and\nMinnie want to preach, why don't you preach at each other? Minnie talks\n'love, love, love.' And you preach health and morality. You drive me\ncrazy between you.\"\n\n\"Suppose,\" he said with a gleam in his eyes, \"suppose I preach 'love,\nlove, love!'\"\n\nShe put her fingers in her ears again. \"Say it to Minnie,\" she cried,\nand turned her back to him.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said. \"Minnie, Miss Jennings refuses to listen, and\nthere are some things I must say. Once again I am going to register a\nprotest against her throwing herself away in a loveless marriage. I--I\nfeel strongly on the subject, Minnie.\"\n\nShe half turned, as if to interrupt. Then she thought better of it and\nkept her fingers in her ears, her face flushed. But he had learned what\nhe hoped--that she could hear him.\n\n\"You ask me why I feel so strongly, Minnie, and you are right to ask.\nUnder ordinary circumstances, Minnie, any remark of mine on the subject\nwould be ridiculous impertinence.\"\n\nHe stopped and eyed her back, but she did not move.\n\n\"It is impertinence under any circumstances, but consider the\nprovocation. I see a young, beautiful and sensitive girl, marrying,\nfrankly without love, a man whom I know to be unworthy, and you ask me\nto stand aside and allow it to happen!\"\n\n\"Are you still preaching?\" she asked coldly over her shoulder. \"It must\nbe a long sermon.\"\n\nAnd then, knowing he had only a moment more, his voice changed and\nbecame deep and earnest. His hands, that were clutching a chair-back,\ntook a stronger hold, so that the ends of the nails were white.\n\n\"You see, Minnie,\" he said, turning a little pale, \"I--I love Miss\nJennings myself. You have known it a long time, for you love her, too.\nIt has come to the point that I measure the day by the hours when I can\nsee her. She doesn't care for me; sometimes I think she hates me.\" He\npaused here, but Miss Patty didn't move. \"I haven't anything to offer\na woman except a clean life and the kind of love that a woman could be\nproud of. I have no title--\"\n\nMiss Patty suddenly took her fingers out of her ears and turned around.\nShe was flushed and shaken, but she looked past him without blinking an\neyelash to me.\n\n\"Dear me,\" she said, \"the sermon must have been exciting, Minnie! You\nare quite trembly!\"\n\nAnd with that she picked up her muff and went out, with not a glance at\nhim.\n\nHe looked at me.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"THAT'S over. She's angry, Minnie, and she'll never\nforgive me.\"\n\n\"Stuff!\" I snapped, \"I notice she waited to hear it all, and no real\nwoman ever hated a man for saying he loved her.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nA BIG NIGHT TO-NIGHT\n\nI carried out the supper to the shelter-house as usual that night, but\nI might have saved myself the trouble. Mrs. Dicky was sitting on a box,\nwith her hair in puffs and the folding card-table before her, and Mr.\nDick was uncorking a bottle of champagne with a nail. There were two or\nthree queer-smelling cans open on the table.\n\nMrs. Dick looked at my basket and turned up her nose.\n\n\"Put it anywhere, Minnie,\" she said loftily, \"I dare say it doesn't\ncontain anything reckless.\"\n\n\"Cold ham and egg salad,\" I said, setting it down with a slam. \"Stewed\nprunes and boiled rice for dessert. If those cans taste as they smell,\nyou'd better keep the basket to fall back on. Where'd you get THAT?\"\nMr. Dick looked at me over the bottle and winked. \"In the next room,\"\nhe said, \"iced to the proper temperature, paid for by somebody else, and\ncoming after a two-weeks' drought! Minnie, there isn't a shadow on my\njoy!\"\n\n\"He'll miss it,\" I said. But Mr. Dick was pouring out three large\ntumblersful of the stuff, and he held one out to me.\n\n\"Miss it!\" he exclaimed. \"Hasn't he been out three times to-day, tapping\nhis little CACHE? And didn't he bring out Moody and the senator and von\nInwald this afternoon, and didn't they sit in the next room there from\ntwo to four, roaring songs and cracking bottles and jokes.\"\n\n\"Beasts!\" Mrs. Dicky said savagely. \"Two hours, and we daren't move!\"\n\n\"Drink, pretty creature!\" Mr. Dick said, motioning to my glass. \"Don't\nbe afraid of it, Minnie; it's food and drink.\"\n\n\"I don't like it,\" I said, sipping at it. \"I'd rather have the spring\nwater.\"\n\n\"You'll have to cultivate a taste for it,\" he explained. \"You'll like\nthe second half better.\"\n\nI got it down somehow and started for the door. Mr. Dick came after me\nwith something that smelled fishy on the end of a fork.\n\n\"Better eat something,\" he suggested. \"That was considerable champagne,\nMinnie.\"\n\n\"Stuff and nonsense,\" I said. \"I was tired and it has rested me. That's\nall, Mr. Dick.\"\n\n\"Sure?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I said with dignity, \"I'm really rested, Mr. Dick. And\nhappy--I'm very happy, Mr. Dick.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I'd better close the door,\" he said. \"The light may be seen--\"\n\n\"You needn't close it until I've finished talking,\" I said. \"I've done\nmy best for you and yours, Mr. Dick. I hope you appreciate it. Night\nafter night I've tramped out here through the snow, and lost sleep, and\nlied myself black in the face--you've no idea how I've had to lie, Mr.\nDick.\"\n\n\"Come in and shut the door, Dick,\" Mrs. Dick called, \"I'm freezing.\"\n\nThat made me mad.\n\n\"Exactly,\" I said, glaring at her through the doorway. \"Exactly--I can\nwade through the snow, bringing you meals that you scorn--oh, yes, you\nscorn them. What did you do to the basket tonight? Look at it, lying\nthere, neglected in a corner, with p--perfectly good ham and stewed\nfruit in it.\"\n\nAll of a sudden I felt terrible about the way they had treated the\nbasket, and I sat down on the steps and began to cry. I remember that,\nand Mr. Dick sitting down beside me and putting his arm around me and\ncalling me \"good old Minnie,\" and for heaven's sake not to cry so loud.\nBut I was past caring. I had a sort of recollection of his getting me to\nstand up, and our walking through about twenty-one miles of snow to the\nspring-house. When we got there he stood off in the twilight and looked\nat me.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Minnie,\" he said, \"I never dreamed it would do that.\"\n\n\"Do what?\"\n\n\"Nothing. You're sure you won't forget?\"\n\n\"I never forget,\" I said. I had got up the steps by this time and was\ntrying to figure why the spring-house door had two knobs.\n\nI hadn't any idea what he meant.\n\n\"Remember,\" he said, very slowly, \"Thoburn is going to have his\nparty to-night instead of to-morrow. Tell Pierce that. To-night, not\nto-morrow.\" I was pretty well ashamed when I got in the spring-house and\nsat down in the dark. I kept saying over and over to myself, so I'd not\nforget, \"tonight, not to-morrow,\" but I couldn't remember WHAT was to be\nto-night. I was sleepy, too, and my legs were cold and numb. I remember\ngoing into the pantry for a steamer rug, and sitting down there for a\nminute, with the rug around my knees before I started to the house. And\nthat is all I DO remember.\n\n\nI was wakened by a terrible hammering in the top of my head. I reached\nout for the glass of water that I always put beside my bed at night and\nI touched a door-knob instead. Then I realized that the knocking wasn't\nall in my head. There was a sort of steady movement of feet on the other\nside of the door, with people talking and laughing. And above it all\nrose the steady knock--knock of somebody beating on tin.\n\n\"Can't do it.\" It was the bishop's voice. \"I am convinced that nothing\nbut dynamite will open this tin of lobster.\"\n\n\"Just a moment, Bishop,\" Mr. Thoburn's voice and the clink of bottles,\n\"I have a can opener somewhere. You'll find the sauce a la Newburg--\"\n\n\"Here, somebody, a glass, quick! A bottle's broken!\"\n\n\"Did anybody remember to bring salt and pepper?\"\n\n\"DEAR Mr. Thoburn!\" It sounded like Miss Cobb. \"Think of thinking of all\nthis!\"\n\n\"The credit is not mine, dear lady,\" Mr. Thoburn said. \"Where the deuce\nis that corkscrew? No, dear lady, man makes his own destiny, but his\nbirth date remains beyond his control.\"\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" somebody said, \"to Mr. Thoburn's birthday being\nbeyond his control!\"\n\nThere was the clink of glasses, but I had remembered what it had been\nthat I was to remember. And now it was too late. I was trapped in the\npantry of my spring-house and Mr. Pierce was probably asleep. I clutched\nmy aching head and tried to think. I was roused by hearing somebody say\nthat Miss Jennings had no glass, and by steps nearing the pantry. I had\njust time to slip the bolt.\n\n\"Pantry's locked!\" said a voice.\n\n\"Drat that Minnie!\" somebody else said. \"The girl's a nuisance.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" Miss Summers said. \"She's probably in there now--taking down\nwhat we say and what we eat. Convicting us out of our own mouths.\"\n\nI held my breath and the knob rattled. Then they found a glass for Miss\nPatty and forgot the pantry.\n\nUnder cover of the next burst of noises I tried the pantry window, but\nit was frozen shut. Nothing but a hammer would have loosened it. I began\nto dig at it with a wire hairpin, but I hadn't much hope.\n\nThe fun in the spring-house was getting fast and furious. Miss Summers\nwas leaning against the pantry door and I judged that most of the men\nin the room were around her, as usual. I put my ear to the panel of\nthe door, and I could pretty nearly see what was going on. They were\ntoasting Mr. Thoburn, and getting hungrier every minute as the supper\nwas put out on the card-tables.\n\n\"To the bottle!\" somebody said. \"In infancy, the milk bottle; in our\nprime, the wine bottle; in our dotage, the pill bottle.\"\n\nMr. von Inwald came over and stood beside Miss Summers, and I could hear\nevery whisper.\n\n\"I have good news for you,\" she said in an undertone.\n\n\"Oh! And what?\"\n\n\"Sh! You may recall,\" she said, \"the series of notes, letters, epistles,\nwith which you have been honoring me lately?\"\n\n\"How could I forget? They were written in my heart's blood!\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" Her voice lifted its eyebrows, so to speak. \"Well, somebody\ngot in my room last night and stole I dare say a pint of your heart's\nblood. They're gone.\"\n\nHe was pretty well upset, as he might be, and she stood by and listened\nto the things he said, which, if they were as bad in English as they\nsounded in German, I wouldn't like to write down.\n\nAnd when he cooled down and condensed, as you may say, into English,\nhe said Miss Jennings must have seen the letters, for she would hardly\nspeak to him. And Miss Summers said she hoped Miss Jennings had--she was\ntoo nice a girl to treat shamefully.\n\nAnd after he had left her there alone, I heard a sort of scratching\non the door behind Miss Summers' back, and then something being shoved\nunder the door. I stooped down and picked it up. It was a key!\n\nI struck a match, and I saw by the tag that it was the one to the old\ndoctor's rooms. I knew right off what it meant. Mr. Pierce had gone to\nbed, or pretended to throw them off the track and Thoburn had locked him\nin! Thoburn hadn't taken any chances. He knew the influence Mr. Pierce\nhad over them all, and he and his champagne and tin cans had to get in\ntheir work before Mr. Pierce had another chance at them.\n\nI had no time to wonder how Miss Summers knew I was in the pantry.\nI tried the window again, but it wouldn't work. Somebody in the\nspring-house was shouting, \"'Hot butter blue beans, please come to\nsupper!'\" and I could hear them crowding around the tables. I worked\nfrantically with the hairpin, and just then two shadowy figures outside\nslipped around the corner of the building. It was Mr. Pierce and Doctor\nBarnes!\n\nI darted back and put my ear to the door, but they did not come in at\nonce. Mr. Thoburn made a speech, saying how happy he was that they were\nall well and able to go back to civilization again, where the broiled\nlobster flourished like a green bay tree and the prune and the cabbage\nwere unknown.\n\nThere was loud applause, and then Senator Biggs cleared his throat.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished fellow guests,\" he began, \"I\nsuggest a toast to the autocrat of Hope Springs. It is the only blot on\nthe evening, that, owing to the exigencies of the occasion, he can not\nbe with us. Securely fastened in his room, he is now sleeping the sleep\nthat follows a stomach attuned to prunes, a mind attuned to rule.\"\n\n\"Eat, drink and be merry!\" somebody said, \"for to-morrow you diet!\"\n\nThere was a swish and rustle, as if a woman got up in a hurry.\n\n\"Do you mean,\" said Miss Patty's clear voice, \"that you have dared to\nlock Mr. Pier--Mr. Carter in his room?\"\n\n\"My dear young lady,\" several of them began, but she didn't give them\ntime.\n\n\"It is outrageous, infamous!\" she stormed. I didn't need to see her to\nknow how she looked.\n\n\"How DARE you! Suppose the building should catch fire!\"\n\n\"Fire!\" somebody said in a bewildered voice. \"My dear young lady--\"\n\n\"Don't 'my dear young lady' me,\" she said angrily. \"Father, Bishop, will\nyou stand for this? Why, he may jump out the window and hurt himself!\nGive me the key!\"\n\nMiss Julia's fingers were beating a tatoo behind her, as if she was\nafraid I might miss it.\n\n\"If he jumps out he probably will hurt himself. It is impossible to\nrelease him now, Miss Jennings, but if you insist we can have a mattress\nplaced under the window.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Thoburn. It won't be necessary.\" The voice came from the door,\nand a hush fell on the party. I slipped my bolt and peeped out. Framed\nin the doorway was Mr. Pierce, with Doctor Barnes looking over his\nshoulder.\n\nThe people in the spring-house were abject. That's the only word for it.\nCraven, somebody suggested later, and they were that, too. They smiled\nsickly grins and tried to be defiant, and most of them tried to put down\nwhatever they held in their hands and to look innocent. If you ever saw\na boy when his school-teacher asks him what he has in his mouth, and\nmultiply the boy thirty times in number and four times in size, you'll\nknow how they looked.\n\nMr. Pierce never smiled. He wouldn't let them speak a word in defense\nor explanation. He simply lined them up as he did at gym, and sent them,\none by one, to the corner with whatever they had in their hands. He\nmade Mr. Jennings give up a bottle of anchovies that he'd stuffed in his\npocket, and the bishop had to come over with a cheese.\n\nAnd when it was all over, he held the door open and they went back\nto the house. They fairly ducked past him in the doorway, although he\nhadn't said a dozen words. It was a rout. The backbone of the rebellion\nwas broken. I knew that never again would the military discipline of\nHope Springs be threatened. Thoburn might as well pack and go. It was\nMr. Pierce's day.\n\nMr. von Inwald was almost the last. He stood by, sneering, with an open\nbottle of olives in his hand, watching the others go out.\n\nMr. Pierce held the door open and eyed him.\n\n\"I'll trouble you to put that bottle with the others, in the corner,\"\nMr. Pierce said sternly.\n\nThey stood glaring at each other angrily.\n\n\"And if I refuse?\"\n\n\"You know the rules here. If you refuse, there is a hotel at\nFinleyville.\"\n\nMr. von Inwald glanced past Mr. Pierce to where Doctor Barnes stood\nbehind him, with his cauliflower ear and his pugilist's shoulders. Then\nhe looked at the bottle in his hand, and from it to Miss Patty, standing\nhaughtily by.\n\n\"I have borne much for you, Patricia,\" he said, \"but I refuse to be\nbullied any longer. I shall go to the hotel at Finleyville, and I shall\ntake the little olives with me.\" He smiled unpleasantly at Mr. Pierce,\nwhose face did not relax.\n\nHe walked jauntily to the door and turned, flourishing the bottle. \"The\nland of the free and the home of the brave!\" he sneered, raising the\nbottle in the air. Standing jeering in the doorway, he bowed to Miss\nPatty and Mr. Pierce, and put an olive into his mouth.\n\nBut instantly he made a terrible face, and clapped a hand just in front\nof his left ear. He stood there a moment, his face distorted--then he\ndarted into the night, and I never saw him again.\n\n\"Mumps!\" Doctor Barnes ejaculated, and stood staring after him from the\nsteps.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nLET GOOD DIGESTION\n\nThere was no one left but Miss Patty. As she started out past him with\na crimson spot in each cheek Mr. Pierce put his hand on her arm. She\nhesitated, and he closed the door on Doctor Barnes and put his back\nagainst it. I had just time to slip back into the pantry and shut myself\nin.\n\nFor a minute there wasn't a sound. Then--\n\n\"I told you I should come,\" Miss Patty said, in her haughtiest manner.\n\"You need not trouble to be disagreeable.\"\n\n\"Disagreeable!\" he repeated. \"I am abject!\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" she said. \"But you needn't explain. It really does\nnot matter.\"\n\n\"It matters to me. I had to do this to-night. I promised you I would\nmake good, and if I had let this pass--Don't you see, I couldn't let it\ngo.\"\n\n\"You can let me go, now.\"\n\n\"Not until I have justified myself to you.\"\n\n\"I am not interested.\"\n\nI heard him take a step or two toward her.\n\n\"I don't quite believe that,\" he said in a low tone. \"You were\ninterested in what I said here this afternoon.\"\n\n\"I didn't hear it.\"\n\n\"None of it?\"\n\n\"Not--not all.\"\n\n\"I spoke, you remember, about your sister, and about Dick--\" he paused.\nI could imagine her staring at him in her wide-eyed way.\n\n\"You never mentioned them!\" she said scornfully and stopped. He laughed,\na low laugh, boyish and full of triumph.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said. \"So you DID hear! I'm going to say it again, anyhow. I\nlove you, Patty. I'm--I'm mad for you. I've loved you hopelessly for so\nlong that to-night, when there's a ray of hope, I'm--I'm hardly sane.\nI--\"\n\n\"Please!\" she said.\n\n\"I love you so much that I waken at night just to say your name, over\nand over, and when dawn comes through the windows--\"\n\n\"You don't know what you are saying!\" she said wildly. \"I am--still--\"\n\n\"I welcome the daylight,\" he went on, talking very fast, \"because it\nmeans another day when I can see you. If it sounds foolish, it's--it's\nreally lots worse than it sounds, Patty.\"\n\nThe door opened just then, and Doctor Barnes' voice spoke from the step.\n\n\"I say,\" he complained, \"you needn't--\"\n\n\"Get out!\" Mr. Pierce said angrily, and the door slammed. The second's\ninterruption gave him time, I think, to see how far he'd gone, and his\nvoice, when he spoke again, was not so hopeful.\n\n\"I'm not pleading my cause,\" he said humbly, \"I know I haven't any\ncause. I have nothing to offer you.\"\n\n\"You said this afternoon,\" Miss Patty said softly, \"that you could offer\nme the--the kind of love that a woman could be proud of.\"\n\nShe finished off with a sort of gasp, as if she was shocked at herself.\nI was so excited that my heart beat a tatoo against my ribs, and without\nmy being conscious of it, as you may say, the pantry door opened about\nan inch and I found myself with an eye to the crack.\n\nThey were standing facing each other, he all flushed and eager and my\ndear Miss Patty pale and trembly. But she wasn't shy. She was looking\nstraight into his eyes and her blessed lips were quivering.\n\n\"How can you care?\" she asked, when he only stood and looked at her.\n\"I've been such a--such a selfish beast!\"\n\n\"Hush!\" He leaned toward her, and I held my breath. \"You are everything\nthat is best in the world, and I--what can I offer you? I have nothing,\nnot even this sanatorium! No money, no title--\"\n\n\"Oh, THAT!\" she interrupted, and stood waiting. \"Well, you--you could at\nleast offer yourself!\"\n\n\"Patty!\"\n\nShe went right over to him and put her hands on his shoulders.\n\n\"And if you won't,\" she said, \"I'll offer myself instead!\"\n\nHis arms went around her like a flash at that, and he kissed her. I've\nseen a good many kisses in my day, the spring-house walk being a sort\nof lover's lane, but they were generally of the quick-get-away variety.\nThis was different. He just gathered her up to him and held her close,\nand if she was one-tenth as much thrilled as I was in the pantry she'd\nbe ready to die kissing.\n\nThen, without releasing her, he raised his head, with such a look of\nvictory in his face that I still see it sometimes in my sleep, and his\neye caught mine through the crack.\n\nBut if I'd looked to see him drop her I was mistaken. He drew her up and\nkissed her again, but this time on the forehead. And when he'd let her\ngo and she had dropped into a chair and hid her shining face against the\nback, as if she was ashamed, which she might well be, he stood laughing\nover her bent head at me.\n\n\"Come out, Minnie!\" he called. \"Come out and hear the good news!\"\n\n\"Hear!\" I said, \"I've seen all the news I want.\"\n\n\"Gracious!\" Miss Patty said, and buried her head again. But he had\nreached the shameless stage; a man who is really in love always seems to\nget to that point sooner or later. He stooped and kissed the back of her\nneck, and if his hand shook when he pushed in one of her shell hairpins\nit was excitement and not fright.\n\n\"I hardly realize it, Minnie,\" he said. \"I don't deserve her for a\nminute.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" I said.\n\n\"He does.\" Miss Patty's voice smothered. Then she got up and came over\nto me.\n\n\"There is going to be an awful fuss, Minnie,\" she said. \"Think of Aunt\nHonoria--and Oskar!\"\n\n\"Let them fuss!\" I said grandly. \"If the worst comes, you can spend your\nhoneymoon in the shelter-house. I'm so used to carrying meals there now\nthat it's second nature.\"\n\nAnd at that they both made for me, and as Mr. Pierce kissed me Doctor\nBarnes opened the door. He stood for a moment, looking queer and wild,\nand then he slammed the door and we heard him stamping down the steps.\n\nMr. Pierce had to bring him back.\n\nWell, that's all there is to it. The place filled up and stayed filled,\nbut not under Mr. Pierce. Mr. Jennings said ability of his kind was\nwasted there, once the place was running, and set him to building a\nrailroad somewhere or other, with him and Miss Patty living in a private\ncar, and he carrying a portable telephone with him so he can talk to her\nevery hour or so. Mr. Dick and his wife are running the sanatorium, or\nthink they are. Doctor Barnes is the whole place, really. Mr. Jennings\nwas so glad to have Miss Patty give up the prince and send him back\nhome, after he'd been a week in the hotel at Finleyville looking as if\nhis face would collapse if you stuck a pin in it--Mr. Jennings was so\nhappy, not to mention having worked off his gout at the wood-pile, that\nhe forgave the Dickys without any trouble, and even went out and had a\nmeal with them in the shelter-house before they moved in, with Mr. Dick\nmaking the coffee.\n\nI miss the spring, as I said at the beginning. It is hard to teach an\nold dog new tricks, but with Miss Patty happy, and with Doctor Barnes\naround--\n\nThoburn came out the afternoon before he left, just after the rest hour,\nand showed me how much too loose his waistcoat had become.\n\n\"I've lost, Minnie,\" he confessed. \"Lost fifteen pounds and the dream of\nmy life. But I've found something, too.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"My waist line!\" he said, and threw his chest out.\n\n\"You look fifteen years younger,\" I said, and at that he came over to me\nand took my hand.\n\n\"Minnie,\" he said, \"maybe you and I haven't always agreed, but I've\nalways liked you, Minnie--always.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said, taking my hand away.\n\n\"You've got all kinds of spirit,\" he said. \"You've saved the place, all\nright. And if you--if you tire of this, and want another home, I've got\none, twelve rooms, center hall, tiled baths, cabinet mantels--I'd be\ngood to you, Minnie. The right woman could do anything with me.\"\n\nWhen I grasped what he meant, I was staggered.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I explained, as gently as I could. \"I'm--I'm going to marry\nDoctor Barnes one of these days.\"\n\nHe stared at me. Then he laughed a little and went toward the door.\n\n\"Barnes!\" he said, turning. \"Another redhead, by gad! Well, I'll tell\nyou this, young woman, you're red, but he's redder. Your days for\nrunning things to suit yourself are over.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of it,\" I retorted. \"I want to be managed myself for a change.\nSomebody,\" I said, \"who won't be always thinking how he feels, unless\nit's how he feels toward me.\"\n\n\"Bah! He'll bully you.\"\n\n\"'It's human nature to like to be bullied,'\" I quoted. \"And I guess I'm\nnot afraid. He's healthy and a healthy man's never a crank.\"\n\n\"A case of yours for health, eh?\" he said, and held out his hand.\n\n\nTHE END"
