 "text": "THE SHADOW-LINE\n\nA CONFESSION\n\nBy Joseph Conrad\n\n\n\n“Worthy of my undying regard”\n\n\n\nTo Borys And All Others Who,\nLike Himself, Have Crossed In Early Youth\nThe Shadow-Line Of Their Generation With Love\n\n\n\n\n\nPART ONE\n\n\n--_D’autre fois, calme plat, grand miroir De mon desespoir_.\n--BAUDELAIRE\n\n\nI\n\nOnly the young have such moments. I don’t mean the very young. No. The\nvery young have, properly speaking, no moments. It is the privilege\nof early youth to live in advance of its days in all the beautiful\ncontinuity of hope which knows no pauses and no introspection.\n\nOne closes behind one the little gate of mere boyishness--and enters an\nenchanted garden. Its very shades glow with promise. Every turn of\nthe path has its seduction. And it isn’t because it is an undiscovered\ncountry. One knows well enough that all mankind had streamed that\nway. It is the charm of universal experience from which one expects an\nuncommon or personal sensation--a bit of one’s own.\n\nOne goes on recognizing the landmarks of the predecessors, excited,\namused, taking the hard luck and the good luck together--the kicks and\nthe half-pence, as the saying is--the picturesque common lot that holds\nso many possibilities for the deserving or perhaps for the lucky. Yes.\nOne goes on. And the time, too, goes on--till one perceives ahead a\nshadow-line warning one that the region of early youth, too, must be\nleft behind.\n\nThis is the period of life in which such moments of which I have spoken\nare likely to come. What moments? Why, the moments of boredom, of\nweariness, of dissatisfaction. Rash moments. I mean moments when the\nstill young are inclined to commit rash actions, such as getting married\nsuddenly or else throwing up a job for no reason.\n\nThis is not a marriage story. It wasn’t so bad as that with me. My\naction, rash as it was, had more the character of divorce--almost of\ndesertion. For no reason on which a sensible person could put a finger I\nthrew up my job--chucked my berth--left the ship of which the worst that\ncould be said was that she was a steamship and therefore, perhaps, not\nentitled to that blind loyalty which. . . . However, it’s no use trying\nto put a gloss on what even at the time I myself half suspected to be a\ncaprice.\n\nIt was in an Eastern port. She was an Eastern ship, inasmuch as then\nshe belonged to that port. She traded among dark islands on a blue\nreef-scarred sea, with the Red Ensign over the taffrail and at her\nmasthead a house-flag, also red, but with a green border and with a\nwhite crescent in it. For an Arab owned her, and a Syed at that. Hence\nthe green border on the flag. He was the head of a great House of\nStraits Arabs, but as loyal a subject of the complex British Empire as\nyou could find east of the Suez Canal. World politics did not trouble\nhim at all, but he had a great occult power amongst his own people.\n\nIt was all one to us who owned the ship. He had to employ white men in\nthe shipping part of his business, and many of those he so employed had\nnever set eyes on him from the first to the last day. I myself saw him\nbut once, quite accidentally on a wharf--an old, dark little man blind\nin one eye, in a snowy robe and yellow slippers. He was having his hand\nseverely kissed by a crowd of Malay pilgrims to whom he had done some\nfavour, in the way of food and money. His alms-giving, I have heard, was\nmost extensive, covering almost the whole Archipelago. For isn’t it said\nthat “The charitable man is the friend of Allah”?\n\nExcellent (and picturesque) Arab owner, about whom one needed not to\ntrouble one’s head, a most excellent Scottish ship--for she was that\nfrom the keep up--excellent sea-boat, easy to keep clean, most handy in\nevery way, and if it had not been for her internal propulsion, worthy of\nany man’s love, I cherish to this day a profound respect for her memory.\nAs to the kind of trade she was engaged in and the character of my\nshipmates, I could not have been happier if I had had the life and the\nmen made to my order by a benevolent Enchanter.\n\nAnd suddenly I left all this. I left it in that, to us, inconsequential\nmanner in which a bird flies away from a comfortable branch. It was\nas though all unknowing I had heard a whisper or seen something.\nWell--perhaps! One day I was perfectly right and the next everything was\ngone--glamour, flavour, interest, contentment--everything. It was one\nof these moments, you know. The green sickness of late youth descended\non me and carried me off. Carried me off that ship, I mean.\n\nWe were only four white men on board, with a large crew of Kalashes and\ntwo Malay petty officers. The Captain stared hard as if wondering what\nailed me. But he was a sailor, and he, too, had been young at one time.\nPresently a smile came to lurk under his thick iron-gray moustache, and\nhe observed that, of course, if I felt I must go he couldn’t keep me\nby main force. And it was arranged that I should be paid off the\nnext morning. As I was going out of his cabin he added suddenly, in a\npeculiar wistful tone, that he hoped I would find what I was so anxious\nto go and look for. A soft, cryptic utterance which seemed to reach\ndeeper than any diamond-hard tool could have done. I do believe he\nunderstood my case.\n\nBut the second engineer attacked me differently. He was a sturdy young\nScot, with a smooth face and light eyes. His honest red countenance\nemerged out of the engine-room companion and then the whole robust man,\nwith shirt sleeves turned up, wiping slowly the massive fore-arms with\na lump of cotton-waste. And his light eyes expressed bitter distaste, as\nthough our friendship had turned to ashes. He said weightily: “Oh! Aye!\nI’ve been thinking it was about time for you to run away home and get\nmarried to some silly girl.”\n\nIt was tacitly understood in the port that John Nieven was a fierce\nmisogynist; and the absurd character of the sally convinced me that he\nmeant to be nasty--very nasty--had meant to say the most crushing thing\nhe could think of. My laugh sounded deprecatory. Nobody but a friend\ncould be so angry as that. I became a little crestfallen. Our chief\nengineer also took a characteristic view of my action, but in a kindlier\nspirit.\n\nHe was young, too, but very thin, and with a mist of fluffy brown beard\nall round his haggard face. All day long, at sea or in harbour, he could\nbe seen walking hastily up and down the after-deck, wearing an\nintense, spiritually rapt expression, which was caused by a perpetual\nconsciousness of unpleasant physical sensations in his internal economy.\nFor he was a confirmed dyspeptic. His view of my case was very simple.\nHe said it was nothing but deranged liver. Of course! He suggested I\nshould stay for another trip and meantime dose myself with a certain\npatent medicine in which his own belief was absolute. “I’ll tell you\nwhat I’ll do. I’ll buy you two bottles, out of my own pocket. There. I\ncan’t say fairer than that, can I?”\n\nI believe he would have perpetrated the atrocity (or generosity) at the\nmerest sign of weakening on my part. By that time, however, I was more\ndiscontented, disgusted, and dogged than ever. The past eighteen months,\nso full of new and varied experience, appeared a dreary, prosaic waste\nof days. I felt--how shall I express it?--that there was no truth to be\ngot out of them.\n\nWhat truth? I should have been hard put to it to explain. Probably, if\npressed, I would have burst into tears simply. I was young enough for\nthat.\n\nNext day the Captain and I transacted our business in the Harbour\nOffice. It was a lofty, big, cool, white room, where the screened light\nof day glowed serenely. Everybody in it--the officials, the public--were\nin white. Only the heavy polished desks gleamed darkly in a central\navenue, and some papers lying on them were blue. Enormous punkahs sent\nfrom on high a gentle draught through that immaculate interior and upon\nour perspiring heads.\n\nThe official behind the desk we approached grinned amiably and kept it\nup till, in answer to his perfunctory question, “Sign off and on again?”\n my Captain answered, “No! Signing off for good.” And then his grin\nvanished in sudden solemnity. He did not look at me again till he\nhanded me my papers with a sorrowful expression, as if they had been my\npassports for Hades.\n\nWhile I was putting them away he murmured some question to the Captain,\nand I heard the latter answer good-humouredly:\n\n“No. He leaves us to go home.”\n\n“Oh!” the other exclaimed, nodding mournfully over my sad condition.\n\nI didn’t know him outside the official building, but he leaned forward\nthe desk to shake hands with me, compassionately, as one would with some\npoor devil going out to be hanged; and I am afraid I performed my part\nungraciously, in the hardened manner of an impenitent criminal.\n\nNo homeward-bound mail-boat was due for three or four days. Being now a\nman without a ship, and having for a time broken my connection with the\nsea--become, in fact, a mere potential passenger--it would have been\nmore appropriate perhaps if I had gone to stay at an hotel. There it\nwas, too, within a stone’s throw of the Harbour Office, low, but somehow\npalatial, displaying its white, pillared pavilions surrounded by trim\ngrass plots. I would have felt a passenger indeed in there! I gave it a\nhostile glance and directed my steps toward the Officers’ Sailors’ Home.\n\nI walked in the sunshine, disregarding it, and in the shade of the big\ntrees on the esplanade without enjoying it. The heat of the tropical\nEast descended through the leafy boughs, enveloping my thinly-clad body,\nclinging to my rebellious discontent, as if to rob it of its freedom.\n\nThe Officers’ Home was a large bungalow with a wide verandah and a\ncuriously suburban-looking little garden of bushes and a few trees\nbetween it and the street. That institution partook somewhat of the\ncharacter of a residential club, but with a slightly Governmental\nflavour about it, because it was administered by the Harbour Office. Its\nmanager was officially styled Chief Steward. He was an unhappy, wizened\nlittle man, who if put into a jockey’s rig would have looked the part to\nperfection. But it was obvious that at some time or other in his life,\nin some capacity or other, he had been connected with the sea. Possibly\nin the comprehensive capacity of a failure.\n\nI should have thought his employment a very easy one, but he used to\naffirm for some reason or other that his job would be the death of him\nsome day. It was rather mysterious. Perhaps everything naturally was too\nmuch trouble for him. He certainly seemed to hate having people in the\nhouse.\n\nOn entering it I thought he must be feeling pleased. It was as still as\na tomb. I could see no one in the living rooms; and the verandah, too,\nwas empty, except for a man at the far end dozing prone in a long chair.\nAt the noise of my footsteps he opened one horribly fish-like eye. He\nwas a stranger to me. I retreated from there, and crossing the dining\nroom--a very bare apartment with a motionless punkah hanging over the\ncentre table--I knocked at a door labelled in black letters: “Chief\nSteward.”\n\nThe answer to my knock being a vexed and doleful plaint: “Oh, dear! Oh,\ndear! What is it now?” I went in at once.\n\nIt was a strange room to find in the tropics. Twilight and stuffiness\nreigned in there. The fellow had hung enormously ample, dusty, cheap\nlace curtains over his windows, which were shut. Piles of cardboard\nboxes, such as milliners and dressmakers use in Europe, cumbered the\ncorners; and by some means he had procured for himself the sort of\nfurniture that might have come out of a respectable parlour in the East\nEnd of London--a horsehair sofa, arm-chairs of the same. I glimpsed\ngrimy antimacassars scattered over that horrid upholstery, which\nwas awe-inspiring, insomuch that one could not guess what mysterious\naccident, need, or fancy had collected it there. Its owner had taken\noff his tunic, and in white trousers and a thin, short-sleeved singlet\nprowled behind the chair-backs nursing his meagre elbows.\n\nAn exclamation of dismay escaped him when he heard that I had come for a\nstay; but he could not deny that there were plenty of vacant rooms.\n\n“Very well. Can you give me the one I had before?”\n\nHe emitted a faint moan from behind a pile of cardboard boxes on the\ntable, which might have contained gloves or handkerchiefs or neckties. I\nwonder what the fellow did keep in them? There was a smell of decaying\ncoral, or Oriental dust of zoological speciments in that den of his. I\ncould only see the top of his head and his unhappy eyes levelled at me\nover the barrier.\n\n“It’s only for a couple of days,” I said, intending to cheer him up.\n\n“Perhaps you would like to pay in advance?” he suggested eagerly.\n\n“Certainly not!” I burst out directly I could speak. “Never heard of\nsuch a thing! This is the most infernal cheek. . . .”\n\nHe had seized his head in both hands--a gesture of despair which checked\nmy indignation.\n\n“Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Don’t fly out like this. I am asking everybody.”\n\n“I don’t believe it,” I said bluntly.\n\n“Well, I am going to. And if you gentlemen all agreed to pay in advance\nI could make Hamilton pay up, too. He’s always turning up ashore dead\nbroke, and even when he has some money he won’t settle his bills. I\ndon’t know what to do with him. He swears at me and tells me I can’t\nchuck a white man out into the street here. So if you only would. . . .”\n\nI was amazed. Incredulous, too. I suspected the fellow of gratuitous\nimpertinence. I told him with marked emphasis that I would see him and\nHamilton hanged first, and requested him to conduct me to my room with\nno more of his nonsense. He produced then a key from somewhere and led\nthe way out of his lair, giving me a vicious sidelong look in passing.\n\n“Any one I know staying here?” I asked him before he left my room.\n\nHe had recovered his usual pained impatient tone, and said that Captain\nGiles was there, back from a Solo Sea trip. Two other guests were\nstaying also. He paused. And, of course, Hamilton, he added.\n\n“Oh, yes! Hamilton,” I said, and the miserable creature took himself off\nwith a final groan.\n\nHis impudence still rankled when I came into the dining room at tiffin\ntime. He was there on duty overlooking the Chinamen servants. The tiffin\nwas laid on one end only of the long table, and the punkah was stirring\nthe hot air lazily--mostly above a barren waste of polished wood.\n\nWe were four around the cloth. The dozing stranger from the chair was\none. Both his eyes were partly opened now, but they did not seem to see\nanything. He was supine. The dignified person next him, with short side\nwhiskers and a carefully scraped chin, was, of course, Hamilton. I have\nnever seen any one so full of dignity for the station in life Providence\nhad been pleased to place him in. I had been told that he regarded me as\na rank outsider. He raised not only his eyes, but his eyebrows as well,\nat the sound I made pulling back my chair.\n\nCaptain Giles was at the head of the table. I exchanged a few words of\ngreeting with him and sat down on his left. Stout and pale, with a great\nshiny dome of a bald forehead and prominent brown eyes, he might have\nbeen anything but a seaman. You would not have been surprised to learn\nthat he was an architect. To me (I know how absurd it is) to me he\nlooked like a churchwarden. He had the appearance of a man from whom you\nwould expect sound advice, moral sentiments, with perhaps a platitude or\ntwo thrown in on occasion, not from a desire to dazzle, but from honest\nconviction.\n\nThough very well known and appreciated in the shipping world, he had\nno regular employment. He did not want it. He had his own peculiar\nposition. He was an expert. An expert in--how shall I say it?--in\nintricate navigation. He was supposed to know more about remote and\nimperfectly charted parts of the Archipelago than any man living. His\nbrain must have been a perfect warehouse of reefs, positions, bearings,\nimages of headlands, shapes of obscure coasts, aspects of innumerable\nislands, desert and otherwise. Any ship, for instance, bound on a trip\nto Palawan or somewhere that way would have Captain Giles on board,\neither in temporary command or “to assist the master.” It was said that\nhe had a retaining fee from a wealthy firm of Chinese steamship owners,\nin view of such services. Besides, he was always ready to relieve any\nman who wished to take a spell ashore for a time. No owner was ever\nknown to object to an arrangement of that sort. For it seemed to be the\nestablished opinion at the port that Captain Giles was as good as\nthe best, if not a little better. But in Hamilton’s view he was an\n“outsider.” I believe that for Hamilton the generalisation “outsider”\n covered the whole lot of us; though I suppose that he made some\ndistinctions in his mind.\n\nI didn’t try to make conversation with Captain Giles, whom I had not\nseen more than twice in my life. But, of course, he knew who I was.\nAfter a while, inclining his big shiny head my way, he addressed me\nfirst in his friendly fashion. He presumed from seeing me there, he\nsaid, that I had come ashore for a couple of days’ leave.\n\nHe was a low-voiced man. I spoke a little louder, saying that: No--I had\nleft the ship for good.\n\n“A free man for a bit,” was his comment.\n\n“I suppose I may call myself that--since eleven o’clock,” I said.\n\nHamilton had stopped eating at the sound of our voices. He laid down\nhis knife and fork gently, got up, and muttering something about “this\ninfernal heat cutting one’s appetite,” went out of the room. Almost\nimmediately we heard him leave the house down the verandah steps.\n\nOn this Captain Giles remarked easily that the fellow had no doubt gone\noff to look after my old job. The Chief Steward, who had been leaning\nagainst the wall, brought his face of an unhappy goat nearer to the\ntable and addressed us dolefully. His object was to unburden himself of\nhis eternal grievance against Hamilton. The man kept him in hot water\nwith the Harbour Office as to the state of his accounts. He wished\nto goodness he would get my job, though in truth what would it be?\nTemporary relief at best.\n\nI said: “You needn’t worry. He won’t get my job. My successor is on\nboard already.”\n\nHe was surprised, and I believe his face fell a little at the news.\nCaptain Giles gave a soft laugh. We got up and went out on the verandah,\nleaving the supine stranger to be dealt with by the Chinamen. The last\nthing I saw they had put a plate with a slice of pine-apple on it before\nhim and stood back to watch what would happen. But the experiment seemed\na failure. He sat insensible.\n\nIt was imparted to me in a low voice by Captain Giles that this was\nan officer of some Rajah’s yacht which had come into our port to be\ndry-docked. Must have been “seeing life” last night, he added, wrinkling\nhis nose in an intimate, confidential way which pleased me vastly. For\nCaptain Giles had prestige. He was credited with wonderful adventures\nand with some mysterious tragedy in his life. And no man had a word to\nsay against him. He continued:\n\n“I remember him first coming ashore here some years ago. Seems only the\nother day. He was a nice boy. Oh! these nice boys!”\n\nI could not help laughing aloud. He looked startled, then joined in the\nlaugh. “No! No! I didn’t mean that,” he cried. “What I meant is that\nsome of them do go soft mighty quick out here.”\n\nJocularly I suggested the beastly heat as the first cause. But Captain\nGiles disclosed himself possessed of a deeper philosophy. Things out\nEast were made easy for white men. That was all right. The difficulty\nwas to go on keeping white, and some of these nice boys did not know\nhow. He gave me a searching look, and in a benevolent, heavy-uncle\nmanner asked point blank:\n\n“Why did you throw up your berth?”\n\nI became angry all of a sudden; for you can understand how exasperating\nsuch a question was to a man who didn’t know. I said to myself that I\nought to shut up that moralist; and to him aloud I said with challenging\npoliteness:\n\n“Why . . . ? Do you disapprove?”\n\nHe was too disconcerted to do more than mutter confusedly: “I! . . . In\na general way. . .” and then gave me up. But he retired in good order,\nunder the cover of a heavily humorous remark that he, too, was getting\nsoft, and that this was his time for taking his little siesta--when he\nwas on shore. “Very bad habit. Very bad habit.”\n\nThere was a simplicity in the man which would have disarmed a touchiness\neven more youthful than mine. So when next day at tiffin he bent his\nhead toward me and said that he had met my late Captain last evening,\nadding in an undertone: “He’s very sorry you left. He had never had a\nmate that suited him so well,” I answered him earnestly, without any\naffectation, that I certainly hadn’t been so comfortable in any ship or\nwith any commander in all my sea-going days.\n\n“Well--then,” he murmured.\n\n“Haven’t you heard, Captain Giles, that I intend to go home?”\n\n“Yes,” he said benevolently. “I have heard that sort of thing so often\nbefore.”\n\n“What of that?” I cried. I thought he was the most dull, unimaginative\nman I had ever met. I don’t know what more I would have said, but the\nmuch-belated Hamilton came in just then and took his usual seat. So I\ndropped into a mumble.\n\n“Anyhow, you shall see it done this time.”\n\nHamilton, beautifully shaved, gave Captain Giles a curt nod, but didn’t\neven condescend to raise his eyebrows at me; and when he spoke it was\nonly to tell the Chief Steward that the food on his plate wasn’t fit\nto be set before a gentleman. The individual addressed seemed much too\nunhappy to groan. He cast his eyes up to the punkah and that was all.\n\nCaptain Giles and I got up from the table, and the stranger next to\nHamilton followed our example, manoeuvring himself to his feet with\ndifficulty. He, poor fellow, not because he was hungry but I verily\nbelieve only to recover his self-respect, had tried to put some of that\nunworthy food into his mouth. But after dropping his fork twice and\ngenerally making a failure of it, he had sat still with an air of\nintense mortification combined with a ghastly glazed stare. Both Giles\nand I had avoided looking his way at table.\n\nOn the verandah he stopped short on purpose to address to us anxiously\na long remark which I failed to understand completely. It sounded like\nsome horrible unknown language. But when Captain Giles, after only an\ninstant for reflection, assured him with homely friendliness, “Aye, to\nbe sure. You are right there,” he appeared very much gratified indeed,\nand went away (pretty straight, too) to seek a distant long chair.\n\n“What was he trying to say?” I asked with disgust.\n\n“I don’t know. Mustn’t be down too much on a fellow. He’s feeling pretty\nwretched, you may be sure; and to-morrow he’ll feel worse yet.”\n\nJudging by the man’s appearance it seemed impossible. I wondered\nwhat sort of complicated debauch had reduced him to that unspeakable\ncondition. Captain Giles’ benevolence was spoiled by a curious air of\ncomplacency which I disliked. I said with a little laugh:\n\n“Well, he will have you to look after him.” He made a deprecatory\ngesture, sat down, and took up a paper. I did the same. The papers\nwere old and uninteresting, filled up mostly with dreary stereotyped\ndescriptions of Queen Victoria’s first jubilee celebrations. Probably we\nshould have quickly fallen into a tropical afternoon doze if it had not\nbeen for Hamilton’s voice raised in the dining room. He was finishing\nhis tiffin there. The big double doors stood wide open permanently, and\nhe could not have had any idea how near to the doorway our chairs\nwere placed. He was heard in a loud, supercilious tone answering some\nstatement ventured by the Chief Steward.\n\n“I am not going to be rushed into anything. They will be glad enough to\nget a gentleman I imagine. There is no hurry.”\n\nA loud whispering from the Steward succeeded and then again Hamilton was\nheard with even intenser scorn.\n\n“What? That young ass who fancies himself for having been chief mate\nwith Kent so long? . . . Preposterous.”\n\nGiles and I looked at each other. Kent being the name of my late\ncommander, Captain Giles’ whisper, “He’s talking of you,” seemed to me\nsheer waste of breath. The Chief Steward must have stuck to his point,\nwhatever it was, because Hamilton was heard again more supercilious if\npossible, and also very emphatic:\n\n“Rubbish, my good man! One doesn’t _compete_ with a rank outsider like\nthat. There’s plenty of time.”\n\nThen there were pushing of chairs, footsteps in the next room, and\nplaintive expostulations from the Steward, who was pursuing Hamilton,\neven out of doors through the main entrance.\n\n“That’s a very insulting sort of man,” remarked Captain\nGiles--superfluously, I thought. “Very insulting. You haven’t offended\nhim in some way, have you?”\n\n“Never spoke to him in my life,” I said grumpily. “Can’t imagine what\nhe means by competing. He has been trying for my job after I left--and\ndidn’t get it. But that isn’t exactly competition.”\n\nCaptain Giles balanced his big benevolent head thoughtfully. “He didn’t\nget it,” he repeated very slowly. “No, not likely either, with Kent.\nKent is no end sorry you left him. He gives you the name of a good\nseaman, too.”\n\nI flung away the paper I was still holding. I sat up, I slapped the\ntable with my open palm. I wanted to know why he would keep harping on\nthat, my absolutely private affair. It was exasperating, really.\n\nCaptain Giles silenced me by the perfect equanimity of his gaze.\n“Nothing to be annoyed about,” he murmured reasonably, with an evident\ndesire to soothe the childish irritation he had aroused. And he was\nreally a man of an appearance so inoffensive that I tried to explain\nmyself as much as I could. I told him that I did not want to hear\nany more about what was past and gone. It had been very nice while it\nlasted, but now it was done with I preferred not to talk about it or\neven think about it. I had made up my mind to go home.\n\nHe listened to the whole tirade in a particular lending-the-ear\nattitude, as if trying to detect a false note in it somewhere; then\nstraightened himself up and appeared to ponder sagaciously over the\nmatter.\n\n“Yes. You told me you meant to go home. Anything in view there?”\n\nInstead of telling him that it was none of his business I said sullenly:\n\n“Nothing that I know of.”\n\nI had indeed considered that rather blank side of the situation I had\ncreated for myself by leaving suddenly my very satisfactory employment.\nAnd I was not very pleased with it. I had it on the tip of my tongue\nto say that common sense had nothing to do with my action, and that\ntherefore it didn’t deserve the interest Captain Giles seemed to be\ntaking in it. But he was puffing at a short wooden pipe now, and looked\nso guileless, dense, and commonplace, that it seemed hardly worth while\nto puzzle him either with truth or sarcasm.\n\nHe blew a cloud of smoke, then surprised me by a very abrupt: “Paid your\npassage money yet?”\n\nOvercome by the shameless pertinacity of a man to whom it was rather\ndifficult to be rude, I replied with exaggerated meekness that I had\nnot done so yet. I thought there would be plenty of time to do that\nto-morrow.\n\nAnd I was about to turn away, withdrawing my privacy from his fatuous,\nobjectless attempts to test what sort of stuff it was made of, when he\nlaid down his pipe in an extremely significant manner, you know, as if a\ncritical moment had come, and leaned sideways over the table between us.\n\n“Oh! You haven’t yet!” He dropped his voice mysteriously. “Well, then I\nthink you ought to know that there’s something going on here.”\n\nI had never in my life felt more detached from all earthly goings on.\nFreed from the sea for a time, I preserved the sailor’s consciousness of\ncomplete independence from all land affairs. How could they concern\nme? I gazed at Captain Giles’ animation with scorn rather than with\ncuriosity.\n\nTo his obviously preparatory question whether our Steward had spoken to\nme that day I said he hadn’t. And what’s more he would have had precious\nlittle encouragement if he had tried to. I didn’t want the fellow to\nspeak to me at all.\n\nUnrebuked by my petulance, Captain Giles, with an air of immense\nsagacity, began to tell me a minute tale about a Harbour Office peon.\nIt was absolutely pointless. A peon was seen walking that morning on the\nverandah with a letter in his hand. It was in an official envelope. As\nthe habit of these fellows is, he had shown it to the first white man\nhe came across. That man was our friend in the arm-chair. He, as I knew,\nwas not in a state to interest himself in any sublunary matters. He\ncould only wave the peon away. The peon then wandered on along the\nverandah and came upon Captain Giles, who was there by an extraordinary\nchance. . . .\n\nAt this point he stopped with a profound look. The letter, he continued,\nwas addressed to the Chief Steward. Now what could Captain Ellis, the\nMaster Attendant, want to write to the Steward for? The fellow went\nevery morning, anyhow, to the Harbour Office with his report, for orders\nor what not. He hadn’t been back more than an hour before there was an\noffice peon chasing him with a note. Now what was that for?\n\nAnd he began to speculate. It was not for this--and it could not be for\nthat. As to that other thing it was unthinkable.\n\nThe fatuousness of all this made me stare. If the man had not been\nsomehow a sympathetic personality I would have resented it like an\ninsult. As it was, I felt only sorry for him. Something remarkably\nearnest in his gaze prevented me from laughing in his face. Neither did\nI yawn at him. I just stared.\n\nHis tone became a shade more mysterious. Directly the fellow (meaning\nthe Steward) got that note he rushed for his hat and bolted out of the\nhouse. But it wasn’t because the note called him to the Harbour Office.\nHe didn’t go there. He was not absent long enough for that. He came\ndarting back in no time, flung his hat away, and raced about the dining\nroom moaning and slapping his forehead. All these exciting facts and\nmanifestations had been observed by Captain Giles. He had, it seems,\nbeen meditating upon them ever since.\n\nI began to pity him profoundly. And in a tone which I tried to make\nas little sarcastic as possible I said that I was glad he had found\nsomething to occupy his morning hours.\n\nWith his disarming simplicity he made me observe, as if it were a matter\nof some consequence, how strange it was that he should have spent the\nmorning indoors at all. He generally was out before tiffin, visiting\nvarious offices, seeing his friends in the harbour, and so on. He had\nfelt out of sorts somewhat on rising. Nothing much. Just enough to make\nhim feel lazy.\n\nAll this with a sustained, holding stare which, in conjunction with\nthe general inanity of the discourse, conveyed the impression of mild,\ndreary lunacy. And when he hitched his chair a little and dropped\nhis voice to the low note of mystery, it flashed upon me that high\nprofessional reputation was not necessarily a guarantee of sound mind.\n\nIt never occurred to me then that I didn’t know in what soundness\nof mind exactly consisted and what a delicate and, upon the whole,\nunimportant matter it was. With some idea of not hurting his feelings I\nblinked at him in an interested manner. But when he proceeded to ask me\nmysteriously whether I remembered what had passed just now between that\nSteward of ours and “that man Hamilton,” I only grunted sourly assent\nand turned away my head.\n\n“Aye. But do you remember every word?” he insisted tactfully.\n\n“I don’t know. It’s none of my business,” I snapped out, consigning,\nmoreover, the Steward and Hamilton aloud to eternal perdition.\n\nI meant to be very energetic and final, but Captain Giles continued to\ngaze at me thoughtfully. Nothing could stop him. He went on to point out\nthat my personality was involved in that conversation. When I tried to\npreserve the semblance of unconcern he became positively cruel. I heard\nwhat the man had said? Yes? What did I think of it then?--he wanted to\nknow.\n\nCaptain Giles’ appearance excluding the suspicion of mere sly malice,\nI came to the conclusion that he was simply the most tactless idiot\non earth. I almost despised myself for the weakness of attempting to\nenlighten his common understanding. I started to explain that I did not\nthink anything whatever. Hamilton was not worth a thought. What such an\noffensive loafer . . . “Aye! that he is,” interjected Captain Giles\n. . . thought or said was below any decent man’s contempt, and I did not\npropose to take the slightest notice of it.\n\nThis attitude seemed to me so simple and obvious that I was really\nastonished at Giles giving no sign of assent. Such perfect stupidity was\nalmost interesting.\n\n“What would you like me to do?” I asked, laughing. “I can’t start a row\nwith him because of the opinion he has formed of me. Of course, I’ve\nheard of the contemptuous way he alludes to me. But he doesn’t intrude\nhis contempt on my notice. He has never expressed it in my hearing.\nFor even just now he didn’t know we could hear him. I should only make\nmyself ridiculous.”\n\nThat hopeless Giles went on puffing at his pipe moodily. All at once his\nface cleared, and he spoke.\n\n“You missed my point.”\n\n“Have I? I am very glad to hear it,” I said.\n\nWith increasing animation he stated again that I had missed his point.\nEntirely. And in a tone of growing self-conscious complacency he told me\nthat few things escaped his attention, and he was rather used to think\nthem out, and generally from his experience of life and men arrived at\nthe right conclusion.\n\nThis bit of self-praise, of course, fitted excellently the laborious\ninanity of the whole conversation. The whole thing strengthened in\nme that obscure feeling of life being but a waste of days, which,\nhalf-unconsciously, had driven me out of a comfortable berth, away from\nmen I liked, to flee from the menace of emptiness . . . and to find\ninanity at the first turn. Here was a man of recognized character and\nachievement disclosed as an absurd and dreary chatterer. And it was\nprobably like this everywhere--from east to west, from the bottom to the\ntop of the social scale.\n\nA great discouragement fell on me. A spiritual drowsiness. Giles’\nvoice was going on complacently; the very voice of the universal hollow\nconceit. And I was no longer angry with it. There was nothing original,\nnothing new, startling, informing, to expect from the world; no\nopportunities to find out something about oneself, no wisdom to acquire,\nno fun to enjoy. Everything was stupid and overrated, even as Captain\nGiles was. So be it.\n\nThe name of Hamilton suddenly caught my ear and roused me up.\n\n“I thought we had done with him,” I said, with the greatest possible\ndistaste.\n\n“Yes. But considering what we happened to hear just now I think you\nought to do it.”\n\n“Ought to do it?” I sat up bewildered. “Do what?”\n\nCaptain Giles confronted me very much surprised.\n\n“Why! Do what I have been advising you to try. You go and ask the\nSteward what was there in that letter from the Harbour Office. Ask him\nstraight out.”\n\nI remained speechless for a time. Here was something unexpected\nand original enough to be altogether incomprehensible. I murmured,\nastounded:\n\n“But I thought it was Hamilton that you . . .”\n\n“Exactly. Don’t you let him. You do what I tell you. You tackle that\nSteward. You’ll make him jump, I bet,” insisted Captain Giles, waving\nhis smouldering pipe impressively at me. Then he took three rapid puffs\nat it.\n\nHis aspect of triumphant acuteness was indescribable. Yet the man\nremained a strangely sympathetic creature. Benevolence radiated from\nhim ridiculously, mildly, impressively. It was irritating, too. But I\npointed out coldly, as one who deals with the incomprehensible, that I\ndidn’t see any reason to expose myself to a snub from the fellow. He\nwas a very unsatisfactory steward and a miserable wretch besides, but I\nwould just as soon think of tweaking his nose.\n\n“Tweaking his nose,” said Captain Giles in a scandalized tone. “Much use\nit would be to you.”\n\nThat remark was so irrelevant that one could make no answer to it.\nBut the sense of the absurdity was beginning at last to exercise its\nwell-known fascination. I felt I must not let the man talk to me any\nmore. I got up, observing curtly that he was too much for me--that I\ncouldn’t make him out.\n\nBefore I had time to move away he spoke again in a changed tone of\nobstinacy and puffing nervously at his pipe.\n\n“Well--he’s a--no account cuss--anyhow. You just--ask him. That’s all.”\n\nThat new manner impressed me--or rather made me pause. But sanity\nasserting its sway at once I left the verandah after giving him a\nmirthless smile. In a few strides I found myself in the dining room, now\ncleared and empty. But during that short time various thoughts occurred\nto me, such as: that Giles had been making fun of me, expecting some\namusement at my expense; that I probably looked silly and gullible; that\nI knew very little of life. . . .\n\nThe door facing me across the dining room flew open to my extreme\nsurprise. It was the door inscribed with the word “Steward” and the\nman himself ran out of his stuffy, Philistinish lair in his absurd,\nhunted-animal manner, making for the garden door.\n\nTo this day I don’t know what made me call after him. “I say! Wait a\nminute.” Perhaps it was the sidelong glance he gave me; or possibly I\nwas yet under the influence of Captain Giles’ mysterious earnestness.\nWell, it was an impulse of some sort; an effect of that force somewhere\nwithin our lives which shapes them this way or that. For if these words\nhad not escaped from my lips (my will had nothing to do with that) my\nexistence would, to be sure, have been still a seaman’s existence, but\ndirected on now to me utterly inconceivable lines.\n\nNo. My will had nothing to do with it. Indeed, no sooner had I made that\nfateful noise than I became extremely sorry for it. Had the man stopped\nand faced me I would have had to retire in disorder. For I had no notion\nto carry out Captain Giles’ idiotic joke, either at my own expense or at\nthe expense of the Steward.\n\nBut here the old human instinct of the chase came into play. He\npretended to be deaf, and I, without thinking a second about it, dashed\nalong my own side of the dining table and cut him off at the very door.\n\n“Why can’t you answer when you are spoken to?” I asked roughly.\n\nHe leaned against the lintel of the door. He looked extremely wretched.\nHuman nature is, I fear, not very nice right through. There are ugly\nspots in it. I found myself growing angry, and that, I believe, only\nbecause my quarry looked so woe-begone. Miserable beggar!\n\nI went for him without more ado. “I understand there was an official\ncommunication to the Home from the Harbour Office this morning. Is that\nso?”\n\nInstead of telling me to mind my own business, as he might have done,\nhe began to whine with an undertone of impudence. He couldn’t see me\nanywhere this morning. He couldn’t be expected to run all over the town\nafter me.\n\n“Who wants you to?” I cried. And then my eyes became opened to the\ninwardness of things and speeches the triviality of which had been so\nbaffling and tiresome.\n\nI told him I wanted to know what was in that letter. My sternness of\ntone and behaviour was only half assumed. Curiosity can be a very fierce\nsentiment--at times.\n\nHe took refuge in a silly, muttering sulkiness. It was nothing to me, he\nmumbled. I had told him I was going home. And since I was going home he\ndidn’t see why he should. . . .\n\nThat was the line of his argument, and it was irrelevant enough to be\nalmost insulting. Insulting to one’s intelligence, I mean.\n\nIn that twilight region between youth and maturity, in which I had my\nbeing then, one is peculiarly sensitive to that kind of insult. I am\nafraid my behaviour to the Steward became very rough indeed. But it\nwasn’t in him to face out anything or anybody. Drug habit or solitary\ntippling, perhaps. And when I forgot myself so far as to swear at him he\nbroke down and began to shriek.\n\nI don’t mean to say that he made a great outcry. It was a cynical\nshrieking confession, only faint--piteously faint. It wasn’t very\ncoherent either, but sufficiently so to strike me dumb at first. I\nturned my eyes from him in righteous indignation, and perceived Captain\nGiles in the verandah doorway surveying quietly the scene, his own\nhandiwork, if I may express it in that way. His smouldering black pipe\nwas very noticeable in his big, paternal fist. So, too, was the glitter\nof his heavy gold watch-chain across the breast of his white tunic.\nHe exhaled an atmosphere of virtuous sagacity serene enough for any\ninnocent soul to fly to confidently. I flew to him.\n\n“You would never believe it,” I cried. “It was a notification that a\nmaster is wanted for some ship. There’s a command apparently going about\nand this fellow puts the thing in his pocket.”\n\nThe Steward screamed out in accents of loud despair: “You will be the\ndeath of me!”\n\nThe mighty slap he gave his wretched forehead was very loud, too. But\nwhen I turned to look at him he was no longer there. He had rushed away\nsomewhere out of sight. This sudden disappearance made me laugh.\n\nThis was the end of the incident--for me. Captain Giles, however,\nstaring at the place where the Steward had been, began to haul at his\ngorgeous gold chain till at last the watch came up from the deep pocket\nlike solid truth from a well. Solemnly he lowered it down again and only\nthen said:\n\n“Just three o’clock. You will be in time--if you don’t lose any, that\nis.”\n\n“In time for what?” I asked.\n\n“Good Lord! For the Harbour Office. This must be looked into.”\n\nStrictly speaking, he was right. But I’ve never had much taste for\ninvestigation, for showing people up and all that no doubt ethically\nmeritorious kind of work. And my view of the episode was purely ethical.\nIf any one had to be the death of the Steward I didn’t see why it\nshouldn’t be Captain Giles himself, a man of age and standing, and a\npermanent resident. Whereas, I in comparison, felt myself a mere bird\nof passage in that port. In fact, it might have been said that I had\nalready broken off my connection. I muttered that I didn’t think--it was\nnothing to me. . . .\n\n“Nothing!” repeated Captain Giles, giving some signs of quiet,\ndeliberate indignation. “Kent warned me you were a peculiar young\nfellow. You will tell me next that a command is nothing to you--and\nafter all the trouble I’ve taken, too!”\n\n“The trouble!” I murmured, uncomprehending. What trouble? All I could\nremember was being mystified and bored by his conversation for a solid\nhour after tiffin. And he called that taking a lot of trouble.\n\nHe was looking at me with a self-complacency which would have been\nodious in any other man. All at once, as if a page of a book had been\nturned over disclosing a word which made plain all that had gone before,\nI perceived that this matter had also another than an ethical aspect.\n\nAnd still I did not move. Captain Giles lost his patience a little. With\nan angry puff at his pipe he turned his back on my hesitation.\n\nBut it was not hesitation on my part. I had been, if I may express\nmyself so, put out of gear mentally. But as soon as I had convinced\nmyself that this stale, unprofitable world of my discontent contained\nsuch a thing as a command to be seized, I recovered my powers of\nlocomotion.\n\nIt’s a good step from the Officers’ Home to the Harbour Office; but with\nthe magic word “Command” in my head I found myself suddenly on the quay\nas if transported there in the twinkling of an eye, before a portal of\ndressed white stone above a flight of shallow white steps.\n\nAll this seemed to glide toward me swiftly. The whole great roadstead\nto the right was just a mere flicker of blue, and the dim cool hall\nswallowed me up out of the heat and glare of which I had not been aware\ntill the very moment I passed in from it.\n\nThe broad inner staircase insinuated itself under my feet somehow.\nCommand is a strong magic. The first human beings I perceived distinctly\nsince I had parted with the indignant back of Captain Giles were the\ncrew of the harbour steam-launch lounging on the spacious landing about\nthe curtained archway of the shipping office.\n\nIt was there that my buoyancy abandoned me. The atmosphere of\nofficialdom would kill anything that breathes the air of human\nendeavour, would extinguish hope and fear alike in the supremacy of\npaper and ink. I passed heavily under the curtain which the Malay\ncoxswain of the harbour launch raised for me. There was nobody in the\noffice except the clerks, writing in two industrious rows. But the head\nShipping-Master hopped down from his elevation and hurried along on the\nthick mats to meet me in the broad central passage.\n\nHe had a Scottish name, but his complexion was of a rich olive hue, his\nshort beard was jet black, and his eyes, also black, had a languishing\nexpression. He asked confidentially:\n\n“You want to see Him?”\n\nAll lightness of spirit and body having departed from me at the touch\nof officialdom, I looked at the scribe without animation and asked in my\nturn wearily:\n\n“What do you think? Is it any use?”\n\n“My goodness! He has asked for you twice today.”\n\nThis emphatic He was the supreme authority, the Marine Superintendent,\nthe Harbour-Master--a very great person in the eyes of every single\nquill-driver in the room. But that was nothing to the opinion he had of\nhis own greatness.\n\nCaptain Ellis looked upon himself as a sort of divine (pagan) emanation,\nthe deputy-Neptune for the circumambient seas. If he did not actually\nrule the waves, he pretended to rule the fate of the mortals whose lives\nwere cast upon the waters.\n\nThis uplifting illusion made him inquisitorial and peremptory. And as\nhis temperament was choleric there were fellows who were actually afraid\nof him. He was redoubtable, not in virtue of his office, but because of\nhis unwarrantable assumptions. I had never had anything to do with him\nbefore.\n\nI said: “Oh! He has asked for me twice. Then perhaps I had better go\nin.”\n\n“You must! You must!”\n\nThe Shipping-Master led the way with a mincing gait around the whole\nsystem of desks to a tall and important-looking door, which he opened\nwith a deferential action of the arm.\n\nHe stepped right in (but without letting go of the handle) and, after\ngazing reverently down the room for a while, beckoned me in by a silent\njerk of the head. Then he slipped out at once and shut the door after me\nmost delicately.\n\nThree lofty windows gave on the harbour. There was nothing in them but\nthe dark-blue sparkling sea and the paler luminous blue of the sky. My\neye caught in the depths and distances of these blue tones the white\nspeck of some big ship just arrived and about to anchor in the outer\nroadstead. A ship from home--after perhaps ninety days at sea. There is\nsomething touching about a ship coming in from sea and folding her white\nwings for a rest.\n\nThe next thing I saw was the top-knot of silver hair surmounting Captain\nEllis’ smooth red face, which would have been apoplectic if it hadn’t\nhad such a fresh appearance.\n\nOur deputy-Neptune had no beard on his chin, and there was no trident\nto be seen standing in a corner anywhere, like an umbrella. But his\nhand was holding a pen--the official pen, far mightier than the sword in\nmaking or marring the fortune of simple toiling men. He was looking over\nhis shoulder at my advance.\n\nWhen I had come well within range he saluted me by a nerve-shattering:\n“Where have you been all this time?”\n\nAs it was no concern of his I did not take the slightest notice of the\nshot. I said simply that I had heard there was a master needed for some\nvessel, and being a sailing-ship man I thought I would apply. . . .\n\nHe interrupted me. “Why! Hang it! _You_ are the right man for that job--if\nthere had been twenty others after it. But no fear of that. They are all\nafraid to catch hold. That’s what’s the matter.”\n\nHe was very irritated. I said innocently: “Are they, sir. I wonder why?”\n\n“Why!” he fumed. “Afraid of the sails. Afraid of a white crew. Too much\ntrouble. Too much work. Too long out here. Easy life and deck-chairs\nmore their mark. Here I sit with the Consul-General’s cable before me,\nand the only man fit for the job not to be found anywhere. I began to\nthink you were funking it, too. . . .”\n\n“I haven’t been long getting to the office,” I remarked calmly.\n\n“You have a good name out here, though,” he growled savagely without\nlooking at me.\n\n“I am very glad to hear it from you, sir,” I said.\n\n“Yes. But you are not on the spot when you are wanted. You know you\nweren’t. That steward of yours wouldn’t dare to neglect a message from\nthis office. Where the devil did you hide yourself for the best part of\nthe day?”\n\nI only smiled kindly down on him, and he seemed to recollect himself,\nand asked me to take a seat. He explained that the master of a British\nship having died in Bangkok the Consul-General had cabled to him a\nrequest for a competent man to be sent out to take command.\n\nApparently, in his mind, I was the man from the first, though for the\nlooks of the thing the notification addressed to the Sailors’ Home was\ngeneral. An agreement had already been prepared. He gave it to me to\nread, and when I handed it back to him with the remark that I accepted\nits terms, the deputy-Neptune signed it, stamped it with his own exalted\nhand, folded it in four (it was a sheet of blue foolscap) and presented\nit to me--a gift of extraordinary potency, for, as I put it in my\npocket, my head swam a little.\n\n“This is your appointment to the command,” he said with a certain\ngravity. “An official appointment binding the owners to conditions which\nyou have accepted. Now--when will you be ready to go?”\n\nI said I would be ready that very day if necessary. He caught me at my\nword with great alacrity. The steamer Melita was leaving for Bangkok\nthat evening about seven. He would request her captain officially to\ngive me a passage and wait for me till ten o’clock.\n\nThen he rose from his office chair, and I got up, too. My head swam,\nthere was no doubt about it, and I felt a certain heaviness of limbs as\nif they had grown bigger since I had sat down on that chair. I made my\nbow.\n\nA subtle change in Captain Ellis’ manner became perceptible as though\nhe had laid aside the trident of deputy-Neptune. In reality, it was only\nhis official pen that he had dropped on getting up.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nHe shook hands with me: “Well, there you are, on your own, appointed\nofficially under my responsibility.”\n\nHe was actually walking with me to the door. What a distance off it\nseemed! I moved like a man in bonds. But we reached it at last. I opened\nit with the sensation of dealing with mere dream-stuff, and then at the\nlast moment the fellowship of seamen asserted itself, stronger than\nthe difference of age and station. It asserted itself in Captain Ellis’\nvoice.\n\n“Good-bye--and good luck to you,” he said so heartily that I could only\ngive him a grateful glance. Then I turned and went out, never to see him\nagain in my life. I had not made three steps into the outer office when\nI heard behind my back a gruff, loud, authoritative voice, the voice of\nour deputy-Neptune.\n\nIt was addressing the head Shipping-Master who, having let me in, had,\napparently, remained hovering in the middle distance ever since. “Mr. R.,\nlet the harbour launch have steam up to take the captain here on board\nthe Melita at half-past nine to-night.”\n\nI was amazed at the startled alacrity of R’s “Yes, sir.” He ran before\nme out on the landing. My new dignity sat yet so lightly on me that\nI was not aware that it was I, the Captain, the object of this last\ngraciousness. It seemed as if all of a sudden a pair of wings had grown\non my shoulders. I merely skimmed along the polished floor.\n\nBut R. was impressed.\n\n“I say!” he exclaimed on the landing, while the Malay crew of the\nsteam-launch standing by looked stonily at the man for whom they were\ngoing to be kept on duty so late, away from their gambling, from their\ngirls, or their pure domestic joys. “I say! His own launch. What have\nyou done to him?”\n\nHis stare was full of respectful curiosity. I was quite confounded.\n\n“Was it for me? I hadn’t the slightest notion,” I stammered out.\n\nHe nodded many times. “Yes. And the last person who had it before you\nwas a Duke. So, there!”\n\nI think he expected me to faint on the spot. But I was in too much of a\nhurry for emotional displays. My feelings were already in such a whirl\nthat this staggering information did not seem to make the slightest\ndifference. It merely fell into the seething cauldron of my brain, and\nI carried it off with me after a short but effusive passage of\nleave-taking with R.\n\nThe favour of the great throws an aureole round the fortunate object of\nits selection. That excellent man enquired whether he could do anything\nfor me. He had known me only by sight, and he was well aware he would\nnever see me again; I was, in common with the other seamen of the port,\nmerely a subject for official writing, filling up of forms with all the\nartificial superiority of a man of pen and ink to the men who grapple\nwith realities outside the consecrated walls of official buildings. What\nghosts we must have been to him! Mere symbols to juggle with in books\nand heavy registers, without brains and muscles and perplexities;\nsomething hardly useful and decidedly inferior.\n\nAnd he--the office hours being over--wanted to know if he could be of\nany use to me!\n\nI ought--properly speaking--I ought to have been moved to tears. But I\ndid not even think of it. It was merely another miraculous manifestation\nof that day of miracles. I parted from him as if he were a mere symbol.\nI floated down the staircase. I floated out of the official and imposing\nportal. I went on floating along.\n\nI use that word rather than the word “flew,” because I have a distinct\nimpression that, though uplifted by my aroused youth, my movements were\ndeliberate enough. To that mixed white, brown, and yellow portion of\nmankind, out abroad on their own affairs, I presented the appearance\nof a man walking rather sedately. And nothing in the way of abstraction\ncould have equalled my deep detachment from the forms and colours of\nthis world. It was, as it were, final.\n\nAnd yet, suddenly, I recognized Hamilton. I recognized him without\neffort, without a shock, without a start. There he was, strolling toward\nthe Harbour Office with his stiff, arrogant dignity. His red face made\nhim noticeable at a distance. It flamed, over there, on the shady side\nof the street.\n\nHe had perceived me, too. Something (unconscious exuberance of spirits\nperhaps) moved me to wave my hand to him elaborately. This lapse from\ngood taste happened before I was aware that I was capable of it.\n\nThe impact of my impudence stopped him short, much as a bullet might\nhave done. I verily believe he staggered, though as far as I could see\nhe didn’t actually fall. I had gone past in a moment and did not turn my\nhead. I had forgotten his existence.\n\nThe next ten minutes might have been ten seconds or ten centuries for\nall my consciousness had to do with it. People might have been falling\ndead around me, houses crumbling, guns firing, I wouldn’t have known.\nI was thinking: “By Jove! I have got it.” _It_ being the command. It had\ncome about in a way utterly unforeseen in my modest day-dreams.\n\nI perceived that my imagination had been running in conventional\nchannels and that my hopes had always been drab stuff. I had envisaged a\ncommand as a result of a slow course of promotion in the employ of some\nhighly respectable firm. The reward of faithful service. Well, faithful\nservice was all right. One would naturally give that for one’s own sake,\nfor the sake of the ship, for the love of the life of one’s choice; not\nfor the sake of the reward.\n\nThere is something distasteful in the notion of a reward.\n\nAnd now here I had my command, absolutely in my pocket, in a way\nundeniable indeed, but most unexpected; beyond my imaginings, outside\nall reasonable expectations, and even notwithstanding the existence of\nsome sort of obscure intrigue to keep it away from me. It is true that\nthe intrigue was feeble, but it helped the feeling of wonder--as if I\nhad been specially destined for that ship I did not know, by some power\nhigher than the prosaic agencies of the commercial world.\n\nA strange sense of exultation began to creep into me. If I had worked\nfor that command ten years or more there would have been nothing of the\nkind. I was a little frightened.\n\n“Let us be calm,” I said to myself.\n\nOutside the door of the Officers’ Home the wretched Steward seemed to be\nwaiting for me. There was a broad flight of a few steps, and he ran\nto and fro on the top of it as if chained there. A distressed cur. He\nlooked as though his throat were too dry for him to bark.\n\nI regret to say I stopped before going in. There had been a revolution\nin my moral nature. He waited open-mouthed, breathless, while I looked\nat him for half a minute.\n\n“And you thought you could keep me out of it,” I said scathingly.\n\n“You said you were going home,” he squeaked miserably. “You said so. You\nsaid so.”\n\n“I wonder what Captain Ellis will have to say to that excuse,” I uttered\nslowly with a sinister meaning.\n\nHis lower jaw had been trembling all the time and his voice was like the\nbleating of a sick goat. “You have given me away? You have done for me?”\n\nNeither his distress nor yet the sheer absurdity of it was able to\ndisarm me. It was the first instance of harm being attempted to be done\nto me--at any rate, the first I had ever found out. And I was still\nyoung enough, still too much on this side of the shadow line, not to be\nsurprised and indignant at such things.\n\nI gazed at him inflexibly. Let the beggar suffer. He slapped his\nforehead and I passed in, pursued, into the dining room, by his screech:\n“I always said you’d be the death of me.”\n\nThis clamour not only overtook me, but went ahead as it were on to the\nverandah and brought out Captain Giles.\n\nHe stood before me in the doorway in all the commonplace solidity of\nhis wisdom. The gold chain glittered on his breast. He clutched a\nsmouldering pipe.\n\nI extended my hand to him warmly and he seemed surprised, but did\nrespond heartily enough in the end, with a faint smile of superior\nknowledge which cut my thanks short as if with a knife. I don’t think\nthat more than one word came out. And even for that one, judging by the\ntemperature of my face, I had blushed as if for a bad action. Assuming a\ndetached tone, I wondered how on earth he had managed to spot the little\nunderhand game that had been going on.\n\nHe murmured complacently that there were but few things done in the town\nthat he could not see the inside of. And as to this house, he had been\nusing it off and on for nearly ten years. Nothing that went on in it\ncould escape his great experience. It had been no trouble to him. No\ntrouble at all.\n\nThen in his quiet, thick tone he wanted to know if I had complained\nformally of the Steward’s action.\n\nI said that I hadn’t--though, indeed, it was not for want of\nopportunity. Captain Ellis had gone for me bald-headed in a most\nridiculous fashion for being out of the way when wanted.\n\n“Funny old gentleman,” interjected Captain Giles. “What did you say to\nthat?”\n\n“I said simply that I came along the very moment I heard of his message.\nNothing more. I didn’t want to hurt the Steward. I would scorn to harm\nsuch an object. No. I made no complaint, but I believe he thinks I’ve\ndone so. Let him think. He’s got a fright he won’t forget in a hurry,\nfor Captain Ellis would kick him out into the middle of Asia. . . .”\n\n“Wait a moment,” said Captain Giles, leaving me suddenly. I sat down\nfeeling very tired, mostly in my head. Before I could start a train of\nthought he stood again before me, murmuring the excuse that he had to go\nand put the fellow’s mind at ease.\n\nI looked up with surprise. But in reality I was indifferent. He\nexplained that he had found the Steward lying face downward on the\nhorsehair sofa. He was all right now.\n\n“He would not have died of fright,” I said contemptuously.\n\n“No. But he might have taken an overdose out of one of them little\nbottles he keeps in his room,” Captain Giles argued seriously. “The\nconfounded fool has tried to poison himself once--a few years ago.”\n\n“Really,” I said without emotion. “He doesn’t seem very fit to live,\nanyhow.”\n\n“As to that, it may be said of a good many.”\n\n“Don’t exaggerate like this!” I protested, laughing irritably. “But I\nwonder what this part of the world would do if you were to leave off\nlooking after it, Captain Giles? Here you have got me a command and\nsaved the Steward’s life in one afternoon. Though why you should have\ntaken all that interest in either of us is more than I can understand.”\n\nCaptain Giles remained silent for a minute. Then gravely:\n\n“He’s not a bad steward really. He can find a good cook, at any rate.\nAnd, what’s more, he can keep him when found. I remember the cooks we\nhad here before his time! . . .”\n\nI must have made a movement of impatience, because he interrupted\nhimself with an apology for keeping me yarning there, while no doubt I\nneeded all my time to get ready.\n\nWhat I really needed was to be alone for a bit. I seized this opening\nhastily. My bedroom was a quiet refuge in an apparently uninhabited wing\nof the building. Having absolutely nothing to do (for I had not unpacked\nmy things), I sat down on the bed and abandoned myself to the influences\nof the hour. To the unexpected influences. . . .\n\nAnd first I wondered at my state of mind. Why was I not more surprised?\nWhy? Here I was, invested with a command in the twinkling of an eye, not\nin the common course of human affairs, but more as if by enchantment. I\nought to have been lost in astonishment. But I wasn’t. I was very much\nlike people in fairy tales. Nothing ever astonishes them. When a fully\nappointed gala coach is produced out of a pumpkin to take her to a ball,\nCinderella does not exclaim. She gets in quietly and drives away to her\nhigh fortune.\n\nCaptain Ellis (a fierce sort of fairy) had produced a command out of a\ndrawer almost as unexpectedly as in a fairy tale. But a command is an\nabstract idea, and it seemed a sort of “lesser marvel” till it flashed\nupon me that it involved the concrete existence of a ship.\n\nA ship! My ship! She was mine, more absolutely mine for possession\nand care than anything in the world; an object of responsibility and\ndevotion. She was there waiting for me, spell-bound, unable to move,\nto live, to get out into the world (till I came), like an enchanted\nprincess. Her call had come to me as if from the clouds. I had never\nsuspected her existence. I didn’t know how she looked, I had barely\nheard her name, and yet we were indissolubly united for a certain\nportion of our future, to sink or swim together!\n\nA sudden passion of anxious impatience rushed through my veins, gave me\nsuch a sense of the intensity of existence as I have never felt before\nor since. I discovered how much of a seaman I was, in heart, in mind,\nand, as it were, physically--a man exclusively of sea and ships; the sea\nthe only world that counted, and the ships, the test of manliness, of\ntemperament, of courage and fidelity--and of love.\n\nI had an exquisite moment. It was unique also. Jumping up from my seat,\nI paced up and down my room for a long time. But when I came downstairs\nI behaved with sufficient composure. Only I couldn’t eat anything at\ndinner.\n\nHaving declared my intention not to drive but to walk down to the quay,\nI must render the wretched Steward justice that he bestirred himself\nto find me some coolies for the luggage. They departed, carrying all\nmy worldly possessions (except a little money I had in my pocket) slung\nfrom a long pole. Captain Giles volunteered to walk down with me.\n\nWe followed the sombre, shaded alley across the Esplanade. It was\nmoderately cool there under the trees. Captain Giles remarked, with a\nsudden laugh: “I know who’s jolly thankful at having seen the last of\nyou.”\n\nI guessed that he meant the Steward. The fellow had borne himself to me\nin a sulkily frightened manner at the last. I expressed my wonder that\nhe should have tried to do me a bad turn for no reason at all.\n\n“Don’t you see that what he wanted was to get rid of our friend Hamilton\nby dodging him in front of you for that job? That would have removed him\nfor good. See?”\n\n“Heavens!” I exclaimed, feeling humiliated somehow. “Can it be possible?\nWhat a fool he must be! That overbearing, impudent loafer! Why! He\ncouldn’t. . . . And yet he’s nearly done it, I believe; for the Harbour\nOffice was bound to send somebody.”\n\n“Aye. A fool like our Steward can be dangerous sometimes,” declared\nCaptain Giles sententiously. “Just because he is a fool,” he added,\nimparting further instruction in his complacent low tones. “For,” he\ncontinued in the manner of a set demonstration, “no sensible person\nwould risk being kicked out of the only berth between himself and\nstarvation just to get rid of a simple annoyance--a small worry.\nWould he now?”\n\n“Well, no,” I conceded, restraining a desire to laugh at that something\nmysteriously earnest in delivering the conclusions of his wisdom as\nthough it were the product of prohibited operations. “But that fellow\nlooks as if he were rather crazy. He must be.”\n\n“As to that, I believe everybody in the world is a little mad,” he\nannounced quietly.\n\n“You make no exceptions?” I inquired, just to hear his manner.\n\n“Why! Kent says that even of you.”\n\n“Does he?” I retorted, extremely embittered all at once against my\nformer captain. “There’s nothing of that in the written character from\nhim which I’ve got in my pocket. Has he given you any instances of my\nlunacy?”\n\nCaptain Giles explained in a conciliating tone that it had been only\na friendly remark in reference to my abrupt leaving the ship for no\napparent reason.\n\nI muttered grumpily: “Oh! leaving his ship,” and mended my pace. He\nkept up by my side in the deep gloom of the avenue as if it were\nhis conscientious duty to see me out of the colony as an undesirable\ncharacter. He panted a little, which was rather pathetic in a way. But\nI was not moved. On the contrary. His discomfort gave me a sort of\nmalicious pleasure.\n\nPresently I relented, slowed down, and said:\n\n“What I really wanted was to get a fresh grip. I felt it was time. Is\nthat so very mad?”\n\nHe made no answer. We were issuing from the avenue. On the bridge over\nthe canal a dark, irresolute figure seemed to be awaiting something or\nsomebody.\n\nIt was a Malay policeman, barefooted, in his blue uniform. The silver\nband on his little round cap shone dimly in the light of the street\nlamp. He peered in our direction timidly.\n\nBefore we could come up to him he turned about and walked in front of us\nin the direction of the jetty. The distance was some hundred yards; and\nthen I found my coolies squatting on their heels. They had kept the pole\non their shoulders, and all my worldly goods, still tied to the pole,\nwere resting on the ground between them. As far as the eye could reach\nalong the quay there was not another soul abroad except the police peon,\nwho saluted us.\n\nIt seems he had detained the coolies as suspicious characters, and had\nforbidden them the jetty. But at a sign from me he took off the embargo\nwith alacrity. The two patient fellows, rising together with a faint\ngrunt, trotted off along the planks, and I prepared to take my leave of\nCaptain Giles, who stood there with an air as though his mission were\ndrawing to a close. It could not be denied that he had done it all. And\nwhile I hesitated about an appropriate sentence he made himself heard:\n\n“I expect you’ll have your hands pretty full of tangled-up business.”\n\nI asked him what made him think so; and he answered that it was his\ngeneral experience of the world. Ship a long time away from her port,\nowners inaccessible by cable, and the only man who could explain matters\ndead and buried.\n\n“And you yourself new to the business in a way,” he concluded in a sort\nof unanswerable tone.\n\n“Don’t insist,” I said. “I know it only too well. I only wish you could\nimpart to me some small portion of your experience before I go. As it\ncan’t be done in ten minutes I had better not begin to ask you. There’s\nthat harbour launch waiting for me, too. But I won’t feel really at\npeace till I have that ship of mine out in the Indian Ocean.”\n\nHe remarked casually that from Bangkok to the Indian Ocean was a pretty\nlong step. And this murmur, like a dim flash from a dark lantern, showed\nme for a moment the broad belt of islands and reefs between that unknown\nship, which was mine, and the freedom of the great waters of the globe.\n\nBut I felt no apprehension. I was familiar enough with the Archipelago\nby that time. Extreme patience and extreme care would see me through the\nregion of broken land, of faint airs, and of dead water to where I would\nfeel at last my command swing on the great swell and list over to the\ngreat breath of regular winds, that would give her the feeling of a\nlarge, more intense life. The road would be long. All roads are long\nthat lead toward one’s heart’s desire. But this road my mind’s eye\ncould see on a chart, professionally, with all its complications and\ndifficulties, yet simple enough in a way. One is a seaman or one is not.\nAnd I had no doubt of being one.\n\nThe only part I was a stranger to was the Gulf of Siam. And I mentioned\nthis to Captain Giles. Not that I was concerned very much. It belonged\nto the same region the nature of which I knew, into whose very soul\nI seemed to have looked during the last months of that existence with\nwhich I had broken now, suddenly, as one parts with some enchanting\ncompany.\n\n“The gulf . . . Ay! A funny piece of water--that,” said Captain Giles.\n\nFunny, in this connection, was a vague word. The whole thing sounded\nlike an opinion uttered by a cautious person mindful of actions for\nslander.\n\nI didn’t inquire as to the nature of that funniness. There was really no\ntime. But at the very last he volunteered a warning.\n\n“Whatever you do keep to the east side of it. The west side is dangerous\nat this time of the year. Don’t let anything tempt you over. You’ll find\nnothing but trouble there.”\n\nThough I could hardly imagine what could tempt me to involve my ship\namongst the currents and reefs of the Malay shore, I thanked him for the\nadvice.\n\nHe gripped my extended arm warmly, and the end of our acquaintance came\nsuddenly in the words: “Good-night.”\n\nThat was all he said: “Good-night.” Nothing more. I don’t know what I\nintended to say, but surprise made me swallow it, whatever it was. I\nchoked slightly, and then exclaimed with a sort of nervous haste: “Oh!\nGood-night, Captain Giles, good-night.”\n\nHis movements were always deliberate, but his back had receded some\ndistance along the deserted quay before I collected myself enough to\nfollow his example and made a half turn in the direction of the jetty.\n\nOnly my movements were not deliberate. I hurried down to the steps, and\nleaped into the launch. Before I had fairly landed in her sternsheets\nthe slim little craft darted away from the jetty with a sudden swirl of\nher propeller and the hard, rapid puffing of the exhaust in her vaguely\ngleaming brass funnel amidships.\n\nThe misty churning at her stern was the only sound in the world. The\nshore lay plunged in the silence of the deeper slumber. I watched the\ntown recede still and soundless in the hot night, till the abrupt hail,\n“Steam-launch, ahoy!” made me spin round face forward. We were close to\na white ghostly steamer. Lights shone on her decks, in her portholes.\nAnd the same voice shouted from her:\n\n“Is that our passenger?”\n\n“It is,” I yelled.\n\nHer crew had been obviously on the jump. I could hear them running\nabout. The modern spirit of haste was loudly vocal in the orders to\n“Heave away on the cable”--to “Lower the sideladder,” and in urgent\nrequests to me to “Come along, sir! We have been delayed three hours for\nyou. . . . Our time is seven o’clock, you know!”\n\nI stepped on the deck. I said “No! I don’t know.” The spirit of modern\nhurry was embodied in a thin, long-armed, long-legged man, with a\nclosely clipped gray beard. His meagre hand was hot and dry. He declared\nfeverishly:\n\n“I am hanged if I would have waited another five minutes Harbour-Master\nor no Harbour-Master.”\n\n“That’s your own business,” I said. “I didn’t ask you to wait for me.”\n\n“I hope you don’t expect any supper,” he burst out. “This isn’t a\nboarding-house afloat. You are the first passenger I ever had in my life\nand I hope to goodness you will be the last.”\n\nI made no answer to this hospitable communication; and, indeed, he\ndidn’t wait for any, bolting away on to his bridge to get his ship under\nway.\n\nThe three days he had me on board he did not depart from that\nhalf-hostile attitude. His ship having been delayed three hours on\nmy account he couldn’t forgive me for not being a more distinguished\nperson. He was not exactly outspoken about it, but that feeling of\nannoyed wonder was peeping out perpetually in his talk.\n\nHe was absurd.\n\nHe was also a man of much experience, which he liked to trot out; but no\ngreater contrast with Captain Giles could have been imagined. He would\nhave amused me if I had wanted to be amused. But I did not want to be\namused. I was like a lover looking forward to a meeting. Human hostility\nwas nothing to me. I thought of my unknown ship. It was amusement\nenough, torment enough, occupation enough.\n\nHe perceived my state, for his wits were sufficiently sharp for that,\nand he poked sly fun at my preoccupation in the manner some nasty,\ncynical old men assume toward the dreams and illusions of youth. I, on\nmy side, refrained from questioning him as to the appearance of my ship,\nthough I knew that being in Bangkok every fortnight or so he must have\nknown her by sight. I was not going to expose the ship, my ship! to some\nslighting reference.\n\nHe was the first really unsympathetic man I had ever come in contact\nwith. My education was far from being finished, though I didn’t know it.\nNo! I didn’t know it.\n\nAll I knew was that he disliked me and had some contempt for my person.\nWhy? Apparently because his ship had been delayed three hours on my\naccount. Who was I to have such a thing done for me? Such a thing had\nnever been done for him. It was a sort of jealous indignation.\n\nMy expectation, mingled with fear, was wrought to its highest pitch. How\nslow had been the days of the passage and how soon they were over.\nOne morning, early, we crossed the bar, and while the sun was\nrising splendidly over the flat spaces of the land we steamed up the\ninnumerable bends, passed under the shadow of the great gilt pagoda, and\nreached the outskirts of the town.\n\nThere it was, spread largely on both banks, the Oriental capital which\nhad as yet suffered no white conqueror; an expanse of brown houses of\nbamboo, of mats, of leaves, of a vegetable-matter style of architecture,\nsprung out of the brown soil on the banks of the muddy river. It was\namazing to think that in those miles of human habitations there was not\nprobably half a dozen pounds of nails. Some of those houses of sticks\nand grass, like the nests of an aquatic race, clung to the low shores.\nOthers seemed to grow out of the water; others again floated in long\nanchored rows in the very middle of the stream. Here and there in the\ndistance, above the crowded mob of low, brown roof ridges, towered great\npiles of masonry, King’s Palace, temples, gorgeous and dilapidated,\ncrumbling under the vertical sunlight, tremendous, overpowering, almost\npalpable, which seemed to enter one’s breast with the breath of one’s\nnostrils and soak into one’s limbs through every pore of one’s skin.\n\nThe ridiculous victim of jealousy had for some reason or other to stop\nhis engines just then. The steamer drifted slowly up with the tide.\nOblivious of my new surroundings I walked the deck, in anxious, deadened\nabstraction, a commingling of romantic reverie with a very practical\nsurvey of my qualifications. For the time was approaching for me to\nbehold my command and to prove my worth in the ultimate test of my\nprofession.\n\nSuddenly I heard myself called by that imbecile. He was beckoning me to\ncome up on his bridge.\n\nI didn’t care very much for that, but as it seemed that he had something\nparticular to say I went up the ladder.\n\nHe laid his hand on my shoulder and gave me a slight turn, pointing with\nhis other arm at the same time.\n\n“There! That’s your ship, Captain,” he said.\n\nI felt a thump in my breast--only one, as if my heart had then ceased to\nbeat. There were ten or more ships moored along the bank, and the one he\nmeant was partly hidden away from my sight by her next astern. He said:\n“We’ll drift abreast her in a moment.”\n\nWhat was his tone? Mocking? Threatening? Or only indifferent? I could\nnot tell. I suspected some malice in this unexpected manifestation of\ninterest.\n\nHe left me, and I leaned over the rail of the bridge looking over the\nside. I dared not raise my eyes. Yet it had to be done--and, indeed, I\ncould not have helped myself. I believe I trembled.\n\nBut directly my eyes had rested on my ship all my fear vanished. It went\noff swiftly, like a bad dream. Only that a dream leaves no shame behind\nit, and that I felt a momentary shame at my unworthy suspicions.\n\nYes, there she was. Her hull, her rigging filled my eye with a great\ncontent. That feeling of life-emptiness which had made me so restless for\nthe last few months lost its bitter plausibility, its evil influence,\ndissolved in a flow of joyous emotion.\n\nAt first glance I saw that she was a high-class vessel, a harmonious\ncreature in the lines of her fine body, in the proportioned tallness of\nher spars. Whatever her age and her history, she had preserved the\nstamp of her origin. She was one of those craft that, in virtue of their\ndesign and complete finish, will never look old. Amongst her companions\nmoored to the bank, and all bigger than herself, she looked like a\ncreature of high breed--an Arab steed in a string of cart-horses.\n\nA voice behind me said in a nasty equivocal tone: “I hope you are\nsatisfied with her, Captain.” I did not even turn my head. It was the\nmaster of the steamer, and whatever he meant, whatever he thought of\nher, I knew that, like some rare women, she was one of those creatures\nwhose mere existence is enough to awaken an unselfish delight. One feels\nthat it is good to be in the world in which she has her being.\n\nThat illusion of life and character which charms one in men’s finest\nhandiwork radiated from her. An enormous bulk of teak-wood timber swung\nover her hatchway; lifeless matter, looking heavier and bigger than\nanything aboard of her. When they started lowering it the surge of the\ntackle sent a quiver through her from water-line to the trucks up the\nfine nerves of her rigging, as though she had shuddered at the weight.\nIt seemed cruel to load her so. . . .\n\nHalf an hour later, putting my foot on her deck for the first time, I\nreceived the feeling of deep physical satisfaction. Nothing could equal\nthe fullness of that moment, the ideal completeness of that emotional\nexperience which had come to me without the preliminary toil and\ndisenchantments of an obscure career.\n\nMy rapid glance ran over her, enveloped, appropriated the form\nconcreting the abstract sentiment of my command. A lot of details\nperceptible to a seaman struck my eye, vividly in that instant. For the\nrest, I saw her disengaged from the material conditions of her being.\nThe shore to which she was moored was as if it did not exist. What were\nto me all the countries of the globe? In all the parts of the world\nwashed by navigable waters our relation to each other would be the\nsame--and more intimate than there are words to express in the language.\nApart from that, every scene and episode would be a mere passing show.\nThe very gang of yellow coolies busy about the main hatch was less\nsubstantial than the stuff dreams are made of. For who on earth would\ndream of Chinamen? . . .\n\nI went aft, ascended the poop, where, under the awning, gleamed the\nbrasses of the yacht-like fittings, the polished surfaces of the rails,\nthe glass of the skylights. Right aft two seamen, busy cleaning the\nsteering gear, with the reflected ripples of light running playfully\nup their bent backs, went on with their work, unaware of me and of\nthe almost affectionate glance I threw at them in passing toward the\ncompanion-way of the cabin.\n\nThe doors stood wide open, the slide was pushed right back. The\nhalf-turn of the staircase cut off the view of the lobby. A low\nhumming ascended from below, but it stopped abruptly at the sound of my\ndescending footsteps.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nThe first thing I saw down there was the upper part of a man’s body\nprojecting backward, as it were, from one of the doors at the foot of\nthe stairs. His eyes looked at me very wide and still. In one hand he\nheld a dinner plate, in the other a cloth.\n\n“I am your new Captain,” I said quietly.\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, he had got rid of the plate and\nthe cloth and jumped to open the cabin door. As soon as I passed into\nthe saloon he vanished, but only to reappear instantly, buttoning up a\njacket he had put on with the swiftness of a “quick-change” artist.\n\n“Where’s the chief mate?” I asked.\n\n“In the hold, I think, sir. I saw him go down the after-hatch ten\nminutes ago.”\n\n“Tell him I am on board.”\n\nThe mahogany table under the skylight shone in the twilight like a dark\npool of water. The sideboard, surmounted by a wide looking-glass in an\normulu frame, had a marble top. It bore a pair of silver-plated lamps\nand some other pieces--obviously a harbour display. The saloon itself was\npanelled in two kinds of wood in the excellent simple taste prevailing\nwhen the ship was built.\n\nI sat down in the armchair at the head of the table--the captain’s\nchair, with a small tell-tale compass swung above it--a mute reminder of\nunremitting vigilance.\n\nA succession of men had sat in that chair. I became aware of that\nthought suddenly, vividly, as though each had left a little of himself\nbetween the four walls of these ornate bulkheads; as if a sort of\ncomposite soul, the soul of command, had whispered suddenly to mine of\nlong days at sea and of anxious moments.\n\n“You, too!” it seemed to say, “you, too, shall taste of that peace and\nthat unrest in a searching intimacy with your own self--obscure as we\nwere and as supreme in the face of all the winds and all the seas, in an\nimmensity that receives no impress, preserves no memories, and keeps no\nreckoning of lives.”\n\nDeep within the tarnished ormulu frame, in the hot half-light sifted\nthrough the awning, I saw my own face propped between my hands. And I\nstared back at myself with the perfect detachment of distance, rather\nwith curiosity than with any other feeling, except of some sympathy for\nthis latest representative of what for all intents and purposes was a\ndynasty, continuous not in blood indeed, but in its experience, in its\ntraining, in its conception of duty, and in the blessed simplicity of\nits traditional point of view on life.\n\nIt struck me that this quietly staring man whom I was watching, both as\nif he were myself and somebody else, was not exactly a lonely figure.\nHe had his place in a line of men whom he did not know, of whom he had\nnever heard; but who were fashioned by the same influences, whose souls\nin relation to their humble life’s work had no secrets for him.\n\nSuddenly I perceived that there was another man in the saloon, standing\na little on one side and looking intently at me. The chief mate. His\nlong, red moustache determined the character of his physiognomy, which\nstruck me as pugnacious in (strange to say) a ghastly sort of way.\n\nHow long had he been there looking at me, appraising me in my unguarded\nday-dreaming state? I would have been more disconcerted if, having the\nclock set in the top of the mirror-frame right in front of me, I had not\nnoticed that its long hand had hardly moved at all.\n\nI could not have been in that cabin more than two minutes altogether.\nSay three. . . . So he could not have been watching me more than a mere\nfraction of a minute, luckily. Still, I regretted the occurrence.\n\nBut I showed nothing of it as I rose leisurely (it had to be leisurely)\nand greeted him with perfect friendliness.\n\nThere was something reluctant and at the same time attentive in his\nbearing. His name was Burns. We left the cabin and went round the ship\ntogether. His face in the full light of day appeared very pale, meagre,\neven haggard. Somehow I had a delicacy as to looking too often at him;\nhis eyes, on the contrary, remained fairly glued on my face. They were\ngreenish and had an expectant expression.\n\nHe answered all my questions readily enough, but my ear seemed to catch\na tone of unwillingness. The second officer, with three or four hands,\nwas busy forward. The mate mentioned his name and I nodded to him in\npassing. He was very young. He struck me as rather a cub.\n\nWhen we returned below, I sat down on one end of a deep, semi-circular,\nor, rather, semi-oval settee, upholstered in red plush. It extended\nright across the whole after-end of the cabin. Mr. Burns motioned to sit\ndown, dropped into one of the swivel-chairs round the table, and kept\nhis eyes on me as persistently as ever, and with that strange air as if\nall this were make-believe and he expected me to get up, burst into a\nlaugh, slap him on the back, and vanish from the cabin.\n\nThere was an odd stress in the situation which began to make me\nuncomfortable. I tried to react against this vague feeling.\n\n“It’s only my inexperience,” I thought.\n\nIn the face of that man, several years, I judged, older than myself, I\nbecame aware of what I had left already behind me--my youth. And that\nwas indeed poor comfort. Youth is a fine thing, a mighty power--as\nlong as one does not think of it. I felt I was becoming self-conscious.\nAlmost against my will I assumed a moody gravity. I said: “I see you\nhave kept her in very good order, Mr. Burns.”\n\nDirectly I had uttered these words I asked myself angrily why the deuce\ndid I want to say that? Mr. Burns in answer had only blinked at me. What\non earth did he mean?\n\nI fell back on a question which had been in my thoughts for a long\ntime--the most natural question on the lips of any seaman whatever\njoining a ship. I voiced it (confound this self-consciousness) in a\ndegaged cheerful tone: “I suppose she can travel--what?”\n\nNow a question like this might have been answered normally, either in\naccents of apologetic sorrow or with a visibly suppressed pride, in a\n“I don’t want to boast, but you shall see,” sort of tone. There are\nsailors, too, who would have been roughly outspoken: “Lazy brute,” or\nopenly delighted: “She’s a flyer.” Two ways, if four manners.\n\nBut Mr. Burns found another way, a way of his own which had, at all\nevents, the merit of saving his breath, if no other.\n\nAgain he did not say anything. He only frowned. And it was an angry\nfrown. I waited. Nothing more came.\n\n“What’s the matter? . . . Can’t you tell after being nearly two years in\nthe ship?” I addressed him sharply.\n\nHe looked as startled for a moment as though he had discovered my\npresence only that very moment. But this passed off almost at once. He\nput on an air of indifference. But I suppose he thought it better to say\nsomething. He said that a ship needed, just like a man, the chance to\nshow the best she could do, and that this ship had never had a chance\nsince he had been on board of her. Not that he could remember. The last\ncaptain. . . . He paused.\n\n“Has he been so very unlucky?” I asked with frank incredulity. Mr. Burns\nturned his eyes away from me. No, the late captain was not an unlucky\nman. One couldn’t say that. But he had not seemed to want to make use of\nhis luck.\n\nMr. Burns--man of enigmatic moods--made this statement with an inanimate\nface and staring wilfully at the rudder casing. The statement itself was\nobscurely suggestive. I asked quietly:\n\n“Where did he die?”\n\n“In this saloon. Just where you are sitting now,” answered Mr. Burns.\n\nI repressed a silly impulse to jump up; but upon the whole I was\nrelieved to hear that he had not died in the bed which was now to be\nmine. I pointed out to the chief mate that what I really wanted to know\nwas where he had buried his late captain.\n\nMr. Burns said that it was at the entrance to the gulf. A roomy grave; a\nsufficient answer. But the mate, overcoming visibly something within\nhim--something like a curious reluctance to believe in my advent (as an\nirrevocable fact, at any rate), did not stop at that--though, indeed, he\nmay have wished to do so.\n\nAs a compromise with his feelings, I believe, he addressed himself\npersistently to the rudder-casing, so that to me he had the appearance\nof a man talking in solitude, a little unconsciously, however.\n\nHis tale was that at seven bells in the forenoon watch he had all hands\nmustered on the quarterdeck and told them they had better go down to say\ngood-bye to the captain.\n\nThose words, as if grudged to an intruding personage, were enough for\nme to evoke vividly that strange ceremony: The bare-footed, bare-headed\nseamen crowding shyly into that cabin, a small mob pressed against that\nsideboard, uncomfortable rather than moved, shirts open on sunburnt\nchests, weather-beaten faces, and all staring at the dying man with the\nsame grave and expectant expression.\n\n“Was he conscious?” I asked.\n\n“He didn’t speak, but he moved his eyes to look at them,” said the mate.\n\nAfter waiting a moment, Mr. Burns motioned the crew to leave the cabin,\nbut he detained the two eldest men to stay with the captain while he\nwent on deck with his sextant to “take the sun.” It was getting toward\nnoon and he was anxious to obtain a good observation for latitude. When\nhe returned below to put his sextant away he found that the two men had\nretreated out into the lobby. Through the open door he had a view of the\ncaptain lying easy against the pillows. He had “passed away” while Mr.\nBurns was taking this observation. As near noon as possible. He had\nhardly changed his position.\n\nMr. Burns sighed, glanced at me inquisitively, as much as to say,\n“Aren’t you going yet?” and then turned his thoughts from his new\ncaptain back to the old, who, being dead, had no authority, was not in\nanybody’s way, and was much easier to deal with.\n\nMr. Burns dealt with him at some length. He was a peculiar man--of\nsixty-five about--iron gray, hard-faced, obstinate, and uncommunicative.\nHe used to keep the ship loafing at sea for inscrutable reasons. Would\ncome on deck at night sometimes, take some sail off her, God only knows\nwhy or wherefore, then go below, shut himself up in his cabin, and play\non the violin for hours--till daybreak perhaps. In fact, he spent most\nof his time day or night playing the violin. That was when the fit took\nhim. Very loud, too.\n\nIt came to this, that Mr. Burns mustered his courage one day and\nremonstrated earnestly with the captain. Neither he nor the second mate\ncould get a wink of sleep in their watches below for the noise. . . .\nAnd how could they be expected to keep awake while on duty? He pleaded.\nThe answer of that stern man was that if he and the second mate didn’t\nlike the noise, they were welcome to pack up their traps and walk over\nthe side. When this alternative was offered the ship happened to be 600\nmiles from the nearest land.\n\nMr. Burns at this point looked at me with an air of curiosity. I began\nto think that my predecessor was a remarkably peculiar old man.\n\nBut I had to hear stranger things yet. It came out that this stern,\ngrim, wind-tanned, rough, sea-salted, taciturn sailor of sixty-five was\nnot only an artist, but a lover as well. In Haiphong, when they got\nthere after a course of most unprofitable peregrinations (during which\nthe ship was nearly lost twice), he got himself, in Mr. Burns’ own\nwords, “mixed up” with some woman. Mr. Burns had had no personal\nknowledge of that affair, but positive evidence of it existed in the\nshape of a photograph taken in Haiphong. Mr. Burns found it in one of\nthe drawers in the captain’s room.\n\nIn due course I, too, saw that amazing human document (I even threw it\noverboard later). There he sat, with his hands reposing on his knees,\nbald, squat, gray, bristly, recalling a wild boar somehow; and by his\nside towered an awful mature, white female with rapacious nostrils and a\ncheaply ill-omened stare in her enormous eyes. She was disguised in some\nsemi-oriental, vulgar, fancy costume. She resembled a low-class medium\nor one of those women who tell fortunes by cards for half a crown. And\nyet she was striking. A professional sorceress from the slums. It was\nincomprehensible. There was something awful in the thought that she was\nthe last reflection of the world of passion for the fierce soul which\nseemed to look at one out of the sardonically savage face of that\nold seaman. However, I noticed that she was holding some musical\ninstrument--guitar or mandoline--in her hand. Perhaps that was the secret\nof her sortilege.\n\nFor Mr. Burns that photograph explained why the unloaded ship had kept\nsweltering at anchor for three weeks in a pestilential hot harbour\nwithout air. They lay there and gasped. The captain, appearing now and\nthen on short visits, mumbled to Mr. Burns unlikely tales about some\nletters he was waiting for.\n\nSuddenly, after vanishing for a week, he came on board in the middle\nof the night and took the ship out to sea with the first break of dawn.\nDaylight showed him looking wild and ill. The mere getting clear of the\nland took two days, and somehow or other they bumped slightly on a\nreef. However, no leak developed, and the captain, growling “no matter,”\n informed Mr. Burns that he had made up his mind to take the ship to\nHong-Kong and drydock her there.\n\nAt this Mr. Burns was plunged into despair. For indeed, to beat up\nto Hong-Kong against a fierce monsoon, with a ship not sufficiently\nballasted and with her supply of water not completed, was an insane\nproject.\n\nBut the captain growled peremptorily, “Stick her at it,” and Mr. Burns,\ndismayed and enraged, stuck her at it, and kept her at it, blowing away\nsails, straining the spars, exhausting the crew--nearly maddened by the\nabsolute conviction that the attempt was impossible and was bound to end\nin some catastrophe.\n\nMeantime the captain, shut up in his cabin and wedged in a corner of his\nsettee against the crazy bounding of the ship, played the violin--or, at\nany rate, made continuous noise on it.\n\nWhen he appeared on deck he would not speak and not always answer when\nspoken to. It was obvious that he was ill in some mysterious manner, and\nbeginning to break up.\n\nAs the days went by the sounds of the violin became less and less loud,\ntill at last only a feeble scratching would meet Mr. Burns’ ear as\nhe stood in the saloon listening outside the door of the captain’s\nstate-room.\n\nOne afternoon in perfect desperation he burst into that room and made\nsuch a scene, tearing his hair and shouting such horrid imprecations\nthat he cowed the contemptuous spirit of the sick man. The water-tanks\nwere low, they had not gained fifty miles in a fortnight. She would\nnever reach Hong-Kong.\n\nIt was like fighting desperately toward destruction for the ship and the\nmen. This was evident without argument. Mr. Burns, losing all restraint,\nput his face close to his captain’s and fairly yelled: “You, sir, are\ngoing out of the world. But I can’t wait till you are dead before I put\nthe helm up. You must do it yourself. You must do it now!”\n\nThe man on the couch snarled in contempt. “So I am going out of the\nworld--am I?”\n\n“Yes, sir--you haven’t many days left in it,” said Mr. Burns calming\ndown. “One can see it by your face.”\n\n“My face, eh? . . . Well, put up the helm and be damned to you.”\n\nBurns flew on deck, got the ship before the wind, then came down again\ncomposed, but resolute.\n\n“I’ve shaped a course for Pulo Condor, sir,” he said. “When we make it,\nif you are still with us, you’ll tell me into what port you wish me to\ntake the ship and I’ll do it.”\n\nThe old man gave him a look of savage spite, and said those atrocious\nwords in deadly, slow tones.\n\n“If I had my wish, neither the ship nor any of you would ever reach a\nport. And I hope you won’t.”\n\nMr. Burns was profoundly shocked. I believe he was positively frightened\nat the time. It seems, however, that he managed to produce such an\neffective laugh that it was the old man’s turn to be frightened. He\nshrank within himself and turned his back on him.\n\n“And his head was not gone then,” Mr. Burns assured me excitedly. “He\nmeant every word of it.”\n\n“Such was practically the late captain’s last speech. No connected\nsentence passed his lips afterward. That night he used the last of his\nstrength to throw his fiddle over the side. No one had actually seen\nhim in the act, but after his death Mr. Burns couldn’t find the thing\nanywhere. The empty case was very much in evidence, but the fiddle\nwas clearly not in the ship. And where else could it have gone to but\noverboard?”\n\n“Threw his violin overboard!” I exclaimed.\n\n“He did,” cried Mr. Burns excitedly. “And it’s my belief he would have\ntried to take the ship down with him if it had been in human power. He\nnever meant her to see home again. He wouldn’t write to his owners, he\nnever wrote to his old wife, either--he wasn’t going to. He had made up\nhis mind to cut adrift from everything. That’s what it was. He didn’t\ncare for business, or freights, or for making a passage--or anything. He\nmeant to have gone wandering about the world till he lost her with all\nhands.”\n\nMr. Burns looked like a man who had escaped great danger. For a little\nhe would have exclaimed: “If it hadn’t been for me!” And the transparent\ninnocence of his indignant eyes was underlined quaintly by the arrogant\npair of moustaches which he proceeded to twist, and as if extend,\nhorizontally.\n\nI might have smiled if I had not been busy with my own sensations,\nwhich were not those of Mr. Burns. I was already the man in command. My\nsensations could not be like those of any other man on board. In that\ncommunity I stood, like a king in his country, in a class all by myself.\nI mean an hereditary king, not a mere elected head of a state. I was\nbrought there to rule by an agency as remote from the people and as\ninscrutable almost to them as the Grace of God.\n\nAnd like a member of a dynasty, feeling a semimystical bond with the\ndead, I was profoundly shocked by my immediate predecessor.\n\nThat man had been in all essentials but his age just such another man\nas myself. Yet the end of his life was a complete act of treason, the\nbetrayal of a tradition which seemed to me as imperative as any guide\non earth could be. It appeared that even at sea a man could become the\nvictim of evil spirits. I felt on my face the breath of unknown powers\nthat shape our destinies.\n\nNot to let the silence last too long I asked Mr. Burns if he had written\nto his captain’s wife. He shook his head. He had written to nobody.\n\nIn a moment he became sombre. He never thought of writing. It took him\nall his time to watch incessantly the loading of the ship by a rascally\nChinese stevedore. In this Mr. Burns gave me the first glimpse of the\nreal chief mate’s soul which dwelt uneasily in his body.\n\nHe mused, then hastened on with gloomy force.\n\n“Yes! The captain died as near noon as possible. I looked through his\npapers in the afternoon. I read the service over him at sunset and\nthen I stuck the ship’s head north and brought her in here.\nI--brought--her--in.”\n\nHe struck the table with his fist.\n\n“She would hardly have come in by herself,” I observed. “But why didn’t\nyou make for Singapore instead?”\n\nHis eyes wavered. “The nearest port,” he muttered sullenly.\n\nI had framed the question in perfect innocence, but his answer (the\ndifference in distance was insignificant) and his manner offered me a\nclue to the simple truth. He took the ship to a port where he expected\nto be confirmed in his temporary command from lack of a qualified master\nto put over his head. Whereas Singapore, he surmised justly, would\nbe full of qualified men. But his naive reasoning forgot to take into\naccount the telegraph cable reposing on the bottom of the very Gulf up\nwhich he had turned that ship which he imagined himself to have saved\nfrom destruction. Hence the bitter flavour of our interview. I tasted it\nmore and more distinctly--and it was less and less to my taste.\n\n“Look here, Mr. Burns,” I began very firmly. “You may as well understand\nthat I did not run after this command. It was pushed in my way. I’ve\naccepted it. I am here to take the ship home first of all, and you may\nbe sure that I shall see to it that every one of you on board here does\nhis duty to that end. This is all I have to say--for the present.”\n\nHe was on his feet by this time, but instead of taking his dismissal\nhe remained with trembling, indignant lips, and looking at me hard as\nthough, really, after this, there was nothing for me to do in common\ndecency but to vanish from his outraged sight. Like all very simple\nemotional states this was moving. I felt sorry for him--almost\nsympathetic, till (seeing that I did not vanish) he spoke in a tone of\nforced restraint.\n\n“If I hadn’t a wife and a child at home you may be sure, sir, I would\nhave asked you to let me go the very minute you came on board.”\n\nI answered him with a matter-of-course calmness as though some remote\nthird person were in question.\n\n“And I, Mr. Burns, would not have let you go. You have signed the ship’s\narticles as chief officer, and till they are terminated at the final\nport of discharge I shall expect you to attend to your duty and give me\nthe benefit of your experience to the best of your ability.”\n\nStony incredulity lingered in his eyes: but it broke down before my\nfriendly attitude. With a slight upward toss of his arms (I got to know\nthat gesture well afterward) he bolted out of the cabin.\n\nWe might have saved ourselves that little passage of harmless sparring.\nBefore many days had elapsed it was Mr. Burns who was pleading with me\nanxiously not to leave him behind; while I could only return him but\ndoubtful answers. The whole thing took on a somewhat tragic complexion.\n\nAnd this horrible problem was only an extraneous episode, a mere\ncomplication in the general problem of how to get that ship--which was\nmine with her appurtenances and her men, with her body and her spirit\nnow slumbering in that pestilential river--how to get her out to sea.\n\nMr. Burns, while still acting captain, had hastened to sign a\ncharter-party which in an ideal world without guile would have been\nan excellent document. Directly I ran my eye over it I foresaw trouble\nahead unless the people of the other part were quite exceptionally\nfair-minded and open to argument.\n\nMr. Burns, to whom I imparted my fears, chose to take great umbrage\nat them. He looked at me with that usual incredulous stare, and said\nbitterly:\n\n“I suppose, sir, you want to make out I’ve acted like a fool?”\n\nI told him, with my systematic kindliness which always seemed to augment\nhis surprise, that I did not want to make out anything. I would leave\nthat to the future.\n\nAnd, sure enough, the future brought in a lot of trouble. There were\ndays when I used to remember Captain Giles with nothing short of\nabhorrence. His confounded acuteness had let me in for this job; while\nhis prophecy that I “would have my hands full” coming true, made it\nappear as if done on purpose to play an evil joke on my young innocence.\n\nYes. I had my hands full of complications which were most valuable\nas “experience.” People have a great opinion of the advantages of\nexperience. But in this connection experience means always something\ndisagreeable as opposed to the charm and innocence of illusions.\n\nI must say I was losing mine rapidly. But on these instructive\ncomplications I must not enlarge more than to say that they could all be\nresumed in the one word: Delay.\n\nA mankind which has invented the proverb, “Time is money,” will\nunderstand my vexation. The word “Delay” entered the secret chamber of\nmy brain, resounded there like a tolling bell which maddens the ear,\naffected all my senses, took on a black colouring, a bitter taste, a\ndeadly meaning.\n\n“I am really sorry to see you worried like this. Indeed, I am. . . .”\n\nIt was the only humane speech I used to hear at that time. And it came\nfrom a doctor, appropriately enough.\n\nA doctor is humane by definition. But that man was so in reality. His\nspeech was not professional. I was not ill. But other people were, and\nthat was the reason of his visiting the ship.\n\nHe was the doctor of our Legation and, of course, of the Consulate,\ntoo. He looked after the ship’s health, which generally was poor, and\ntrembling, as it were, on the verge of a break-up. Yes. The men ailed.\nAnd thus time was not only money, but life as well.\n\nI had never seen such a steady ship’s company. As the doctor remarked to\nme: “You seem to have a most respectable lot of seamen.” Not only were\nthey consistently sober, but they did not even want to go ashore. Care\nwas taken to expose them as little as possible to the sun. They\nwere employed on light work under the awnings. And the humane doctor\ncommended me.\n\n“Your arrangements appear to me to be very judicious, my dear Captain.”\n\nIt is difficult to express how much that pronouncement comforted me.\nThe doctor’s round, full face framed in a light-coloured whisker was the\nperfection of a dignified amenity. He was the only human being in\nthe world who seemed to take the slightest interest in me. He would\ngenerally sit in the cabin for half an hour or so at every visit.\n\nI said to him one day:\n\n“I suppose the only thing now is to take care of them as you are doing\ntill I can get the ship to sea?”\n\nHe inclined his head, shutting his eyes under the large spectacles, and\nmurmured:\n\n“The sea . . . undoubtedly.”\n\nThe first member of the crew fairly knocked over was the steward--the\nfirst man to whom I had spoken on board. He was taken ashore (with\ncholeric symptoms) and died there at the end of a week. Then, while I\nwas still under the startling impression of this first home-thrust of\nthe climate, Mr. Burns gave up and went to bed in a raging fever without\nsaying a word to anybody.\n\nI believe he had partly fretted himself into that illness; the climate\ndid the rest with the swiftness of an invisible monster ambushed in\nthe air, in the water, in the mud of the river-bank. Mr. Burns was a\npredestined victim.\n\nI discovered him lying on his back, glaring sullenly and radiating heat\non one like a small furnace. He would hardly answer my questions, and\nonly grumbled. Couldn’t a man take an afternoon off duty with a bad\nheadache--for once?\n\nThat evening, as I sat in the saloon after dinner, I could hear him\nmuttering continuously in his room. Ransome, who was clearing the table,\nsaid to me:\n\n“I am afraid, sir, I won’t be able to give the mate all the attention\nhe’s likely to need. I will have to be forward in the galley a great\npart of my time.”\n\nRansome was the cook. The mate had pointed him out to me the first day,\nstanding on the deck, his arms crossed on his broad chest, gazing on the\nriver.\n\nEven at a distance his well-proportioned figure, something thoroughly\nsailor-like in his poise, made him noticeable. On nearer view the\nintelligent, quiet eyes, a well-bred face, the disciplined independence\nof his manner made up an attractive personality. When, in addition, Mr.\nBurns told me that he was the best seaman in the ship, I expressed my\nsurprise that in his earliest prime and of such appearance he should\nsign on as cook on board a ship.\n\n“It’s his heart,” Mr. Burns had said. “There’s something wrong with it.\nHe mustn’t exert himself too much or he may drop dead suddenly.”\n\nAnd he was the only one the climate had not touched--perhaps because,\ncarrying a deadly enemy in his breast, he had schooled himself into a\nsystematic control of feelings and movements. When one was in the secret\nthis was apparent in his manner. After the poor steward died, and as he\ncould not be replaced by a white man in this Oriental port, Ransome had\nvolunteered to do the double work.\n\n“I can do it all right, sir, as long as I go about it quietly,” he had\nassured me.\n\nBut obviously he couldn’t be expected to take up sick-nursing in\naddition. Moreover, the doctor peremptorily ordered Mr. Burns ashore.\n\nWith a seaman on each side holding him up under the arms, the mate went\nover the gangway more sullen than ever. We built him up with pillows in\nthe gharry, and he made an effort to say brokenly:\n\n“Now--you’ve got--what you wanted--got me out of--the ship.”\n\n“You were never more mistaken in your life, Mr. Burns,” I said quietly,\nduly smiling at him; and the trap drove off to a sort of sanatorium, a\npavilion of bricks which the doctor had in the grounds of his residence.\n\nI visited Mr. Burns regularly. After the first few days, when he didn’t\nknow anybody, he received me as if I had come either to gloat over\nan enemy or else to curry favour with a deeply wronged person. It was\neither one or the other, just as it happened according to his fantastic\nsickroom moods. Whichever it was, he managed to convey it to me even\nduring the period when he appeared almost too weak to talk. I treated\nhim to my invariable kindliness.\n\nThen one day, suddenly, a surge of downright panic burst through all\nthis craziness.\n\nIf I left him behind in this deadly place he would die. He felt it, he\nwas certain of it. But I wouldn’t have the heart to leave him ashore. He\nhad a wife and child in Sydney.\n\nHe produced his wasted forearms from under the sheet which covered him\nand clasped his fleshless claws. He would die! He would die here. . . .\n\nHe absolutely managed to sit up, but only for a moment, and when he fell\nback I really thought that he would die there and then. I called to the\nBengali dispenser, and hastened away from the room.\n\nNext day he upset me thoroughly by renewing his entreaties. I returned\nan evasive answer, and left him the picture of ghastly despair. The day\nafter I went in with reluctance, and he attacked me at once in a\nmuch stronger voice and with an abundance of argument which was quite\nstartling. He presented his case with a sort of crazy vigour, and asked\nme finally how would I like to have a man’s death on my conscience? He\nwanted me to promise that I would not sail without him.\n\nI said that I really must consult the doctor first. He cried out at\nthat. The doctor! Never! That would be a death sentence.\n\nThe effort had exhausted him. He closed his eyes, but went on rambling\nin a low voice. I had hated him from the start. The late captain had\nhated him, too. Had wished him dead. Had wished all hands dead. . . .\n\n“What do you want to stand in with that wicked corpse for, sir? He’ll\nhave you, too,” he ended, blinking his glazed eyes vacantly.\n\n“Mr. Burns,” I cried, very much discomposed, “what on earth are you\ntalking about?”\n\nHe seemed to come to himself, though he was too weak to start.\n\n“I don’t know,” he said languidly. “But don’t ask that doctor, sir. You\nand I are sailors. Don’t ask him, sir. Some day perhaps you will have a\nwife and child yourself.”\n\nAnd again he pleaded for the promise that I would not leave him behind.\nI had the firmness of mind not to give it to him. Afterward this\nsternness seemed criminal; for my mind was made up. That prostrated man,\nwith hardly strength enough to breathe and ravaged by a passion of fear,\nwas irresistible. And, besides, he had happened to hit on the right\nwords. He and I were sailors. That was a claim, for I had no other\nfamily. As to the wife and child (some day) argument, it had no force.\nIt sounded merely bizarre.\n\nI could imagine no claim that would be stronger and more absorbing\nthan the claim of that ship, of these men snared in the river by silly\ncommercial complications, as if in some poisonous trap.\n\nHowever, I had nearly fought my way out. Out to sea. The sea--which was\npure, safe, and friendly. Three days more.\n\nThat thought sustained and carried me on my way back to the ship. In the\nsaloon the doctor’s voice greeted me, and his large form followed\nhis voice, issuing out of the starboard spare cabin where the ship’s\nmedicine chest was kept securely lashed in the bed-place.\n\nFinding that I was not on board he had gone in there, he said, to\ninspect the supply of drugs, bandages, and so on. Everything was\ncompleted and in order.\n\nI thanked him; I had just been thinking of asking him to do that very\nthing, as in a couple of days, as he knew, we were going to sea, where\nall our troubles of every sort would be over at last.\n\nHe listened gravely and made no answer. But when I opened to him my mind\nas to Mr. Burns he sat down by my side, and, laying his hand on my knee\namicably, begged me to think what it was I was exposing myself to.\n\nThe man was just strong enough to bear being moved and no more. But he\ncouldn’t stand a return of the fever. I had before me a passage of sixty\ndays perhaps, beginning with intricate navigation and ending probably\nwith a lot of bad weather. Could I run the risk of having to go through\nit single-handed, with no chief officer and with a second quite a youth?\n. . .\n\nHe might have added that it was my first command, too. He did probably\nthink of that fact, for he checked himself. It was very present to my\nmind.\n\nHe advised me earnestly to cable to Singapore for a chief officer, even\nif I had to delay my sailing for a week.\n\n“Never,” I said. The very thought gave me the shivers. The hands seemed\nfairly fit, all of them, and this was the time to get them away. Once at\nsea I was not afraid of facing anything. The sea was now the only remedy\nfor all my troubles.\n\nThe doctor’s glasses were directed at me like two lamps searching the\ngenuineness of my resolution. He opened his lips as if to argue further,\nbut shut them again without saying anything. I had a vision so vivid of\npoor Burns in his exhaustion, helplessness, and anguish, that it moved\nme more than the reality I had come away from only an hour before. It\nwas purged from the drawbacks of his personality, and I could not resist\nit.\n\n“Look here,” I said. “Unless you tell me officially that the man\nmust not be moved I’ll make arrangements to have him brought on board\ntomorrow, and shall take the ship out of the river next morning, even if\nI have to anchor outside the bar for a couple of days to get her ready\nfor sea.”\n\n“Oh! I’ll make all the arrangements myself,” said the doctor at once.\n“I spoke as I did only as a friend--as a well-wisher, and that sort of\nthing.”\n\nHe rose in his dignified simplicity and gave me a warm handshake, rather\nsolemnly, I thought. But he was as good as his word. When Mr. Burns\nappeared at the gangway carried on a stretcher, the doctor himself\nwalked by its side. The programme had been altered in so far that this\ntransportation had been left to the last moment, on the very morning of\nour departure.\n\nIt was barely an hour after sunrise. The doctor waved his big arm to me\nfrom the shore and walked back at once to his trap, which had followed\nhim empty to the river-side. Mr. Burns, carried across the quarter-deck,\nhad the appearance of being absolutely lifeless. Ransome went down to\nsettle him in his cabin. I had to remain on deck to look after the ship,\nfor the tug had got hold of our towrope already.\n\nThe splash of our shore-fasts falling in the water produced a complete\nchange of feeling in me. It was like the imperfect relief of awakening\nfrom a nightmare. But when the ship’s head swung down the river away\nfrom that town, Oriental and squalid, I missed the expected elation of\nthat striven-for moment. What there was, undoubtedly, was a relaxation\nof tension which translated itself into a sense of weariness after an\ninglorious fight.\n\nAbout midday we anchored a mile outside the bar. The afternoon was busy\nfor all hands. Watching the work from the poop, where I remained all the\ntime, I detected in it some of the languor of the six weeks spent in the\nsteaming heat of the river. The first breeze would blow that away. Now\nthe calm was complete. I judged that the second officer--a callow youth\nwith an unpromising face--was not, to put it mildly, of that invaluable\nstuff from which a commander’s right hand is made. But I was glad to\ncatch along the main deck a few smiles on those seamen’s faces at which\nI had hardly had time to have a good look as yet. Having thrown off the\nmortal coil of shore affairs, I felt myself familiar with them and yet a\nlittle strange, like a long-lost wanderer among his kin.\n\nRansome flitted continually to and fro between the galley and the cabin.\nIt was a pleasure to look at him. The man positively had grace. He\nalone of all the crew had not had a day’s illness in port. But with\nthe knowledge of that uneasy heart within his breast I could detect the\nrestraint he put on the natural sailor-like agility of his movements. It\nwas as though he had something very fragile or very explosive to carry\nabout his person and was all the time aware of it.\n\nI had occasion to address him once or twice. He answered me in his\npleasant, quiet voice and with a faint, slightly wistful smile. Mr.\nBurns appeared to be resting. He seemed fairly comfortable.\n\nAfter sunset I came out on deck again to meet only a still void. The\nthin, featureless crust of the coast could not be distinguished. The\ndarkness had risen around the ship like a mysterious emanation from the\ndumb and lonely waters. I leaned on the rail and turned my ear to the\nshadows of the night. Not a sound. My command might have been a planet\nflying vertiginously on its appointed path in a space of infinite\nsilence. I clung to the rail as if my sense of balance were leaving me\nfor good. How absurd. I failed nervously.\n\n“On deck there!”\n\nThe immediate answer, “Yes, sir,” broke the spell. The anchor-watch\nman ran up the poop ladder smartly. I told him to report at once the\nslightest sign of a breeze coming.\n\nGoing below I looked in on Mr. Burns. In fact, I could not avoid seeing\nhim, for his door stood open. The man was so wasted that, in this white\ncabin, under a white sheet, and with his diminished head sunk in the\nwhite pillow, his red moustaches captured their eyes exclusively, like\nsomething artificial--a pair of moustaches from a shop exhibited there\nin the harsh light of the bulkhead-lamp without a shade.\n\nWhile I stared with a sort of wonder he asserted himself by opening his\neyes and even moving them in my direction. A minute stir.\n\n“Dead calm, Mr. Burns,” I said resignedly.\n\nIn an unexpectedly distinct voice Mr. Burns began a rambling speech. Its\ntone was very strange, not as if affected by his illness, but as if of\na different nature. It sounded unearthly. As to the matter, I seemed\nto make out that it was the fault of the “old man”--the late\ncaptain--ambushed down there under the sea with some evil intention. It\nwas a weird story.\n\nI listened to the end; then stepping into the cabin I laid my hand on\nthe mate’s forehead. It was cool. He was light-headed only from extreme\nweakness. Suddenly he seemed to become aware of me, and in his own\nvoice--of course, very feeble--he asked regretfully:\n\n“Is there no chance at all to get under way, sir?”\n\n“What’s the good of letting go our hold of the ground only to drift, Mr.\nBurns?” I answered.\n\nHe sighed and I left him to his immobility. His hold on life was\nas slender as his hold on sanity. I was oppressed by my lonely\nresponsibilities. I went into my cabin to seek relief in a few hours’\nsleep, but almost before I closed my eyes the man on deck came down\nreporting a light breeze. Enough to get under way with, he said.\n\nAnd it was no more than just enough. I ordered the windlass manned, the\nsails loosed, and the topsails set. But by the time I had cast the ship\nI could hardly feel any breath of wind. Nevertheless, I trimmed the\nyards and put everything on her. I was not going to give up the attempt.\n\n\n\n\n\nPART TWO\n\n\nIV\n\nWith her anchor at the bow and clothed in canvas to her very trucks, my\ncommand seemed to stand as motionless as a model ship set on the gleams\nand shadows of polished marble. It was impossible to distinguish land\nfrom water in the enigmatical tranquillity of the immense forces of the\nworld. A sudden impatience possessed me.\n\n“Won’t she answer the helm at all?” I said irritably to the man whose\nstrong brown hands grasping the spokes of the wheel stood out lighted on\nthe darkness; like a symbol of mankind’s claim to the direction of its\nown fate.\n\nHe answered me.\n\n“Yes, sir. She’s coming-to slowly.”\n\n“Let her head come up to south.”\n\n“Aye, aye, sir.”\n\nI paced the poop. There was not a sound but that of my footsteps, till\nthe man spoke again.\n\n“She is at south now, sir.”\n\nI felt a slight tightness of the chest before I gave out the first\ncourse of my first command to the silent night, heavy with dew and\nsparkling with stars. There was a finality in the act committing me to\nthe endless vigilance of my lonely task.\n\n“Steady her head at that,” I said at last. “The course is south.”\n\n“South, sir,” echoed the man.\n\nI sent below the second mate and his watch and remained in charge,\nwalking the deck through the chill, somnolent hours that precede the\ndawn.\n\nSlight puffs came and went, and whenever they were strong enough to wake\nup the black water the murmur alongside ran through my very heart in\na delicate crescendo of delight and died away swiftly. I was bitterly\ntired. The very stars seemed weary of waiting for daybreak. It came at\nlast with a mother-of-pearl sheen at the zenith, such as I had never\nseen before in the tropics, unglowing, almost gray, with a strange\nreminder of high latitudes.\n\nThe voice of the look-out man hailed from forward:\n\n“Land on the port bow, sir.”\n\n“All right.”\n\nLeaning on the rail I never even raised my eyes.\n\nThe motion of the ship was imperceptible. Presently Ransome brought me\nthe cup of morning coffee. After I had drunk it I looked ahead, and\nin the still streak of very bright pale orange light I saw the land\nprofiled flatly as if cut out of black paper and seeming to float on\nthe water as light as cork. But the rising sun turned it into mere dark\nvapour, a doubtful, massive shadow trembling in the hot glare.\n\nThe watch finished washing decks. I went below and stopped at Mr. Burns’\ndoor (he could not bear to have it shut), but hesitated to speak to him\ntill he moved his eyes. I gave him the news.\n\n“Sighted Cape Liant at daylight. About fifteen miles.”\n\nHe moved his lips then, but I heard no sound till I put my ear down, and\ncaught the peevish comment: “This is crawling. . . . No luck.”\n\n“Better luck than standing still, anyhow,” I pointed out resignedly, and\nleft him to whatever thoughts or fancies haunted his awful immobility.\n\nLater that morning, when relieved by my second officer, I threw myself\non my couch and for some three hours or so I really found oblivion. It\nwas so perfect that on waking up I wondered where I was. Then came the\nimmense relief of the thought: on board my ship! At sea! At sea!\n\nThrough the port-holes I beheld an unruffled, sun-smitten horizon. The\nhorizon of a windless day. But its spaciousness alone was enough to give\nme a sense of a fortunate escape, a momentary exultation of freedom.\n\nI stepped out into the saloon with my heart lighter than it had been for\ndays. Ransome was at the sideboard preparing to lay the table for the\nfirst sea dinner of the passage. He turned his head, and something in\nhis eyes checked my modest elation.\n\nInstinctively I asked: “What is it now?” not expecting in the least the\nanswer I got. It was given with that sort of contained serenity which\nwas characteristic of the man.\n\n“I am afraid we haven’t left all sickness behind us, sir.”\n\n“We haven’t! What’s the matter?”\n\nHe told me then that two of our men had been taken bad with fever in\nthe night. One of them was burning and the other was shivering, but he\nthought that it was pretty much the same thing. I thought so, too. I\nfelt shocked by the news. “One burning, the other shivering, you say?\nNo. We haven’t left the sickness behind. Do they look very ill?”\n\n“Middling bad, sir.” Ransome’s eyes gazed steadily into mine. We\nexchanged smiles. Ransome’s a little wistful, as usual, mine no doubt\ngrim enough, to correspond with my secret exasperation.\n\nI asked:\n\n“Was there any wind at all this morning?”\n\n“Can hardly say that, sir. We’ve moved all the time though. The land\nahead seems a little nearer.”\n\nThat was it. A little nearer. Whereas if we had only had a little more\nwind, only a very little more, we might, we should, have been abreast\nof Liant by this time and increasing our distance from that contaminated\nshore. And it was not only the distance. It seemed to me that a stronger\nbreeze would have blown away the contamination which clung to the ship.\nIt obviously did cling to the ship. Two men. One burning, one shivering.\nI felt a distinct reluctance to go and look at them. What was the good?\nPoison is poison. Tropical fever is tropical fever. But that it\nshould have stretched its claw after us over the sea seemed to me an\nextraordinary and unfair license. I could hardly believe that it could\nbe anything worse than the last desperate pluck of the evil from which\nwe were escaping into the clean breath of the sea. If only that breath\nhad been a little stronger. However, there was the quinine against the\nfever. I went into the spare cabin where the medicine chest was kept to\nprepare two doses. I opened it full of faith as a man opens a miraculous\nshrine. The upper part was inhabited by a collection of bottles, all\nsquare-shouldered and as like each other as peas. Under that orderly\narray there were two drawers, stuffed as full of things as one could\nimagine--paper packages, bandages, cardboard boxes officially labelled.\nThe lower of the two, in one of its compartments, contained our\nprovision of quinine.\n\nThere were five bottles, all round and all of a size. One was about\na third full. The other four remained still wrapped up in paper and\nsealed. But I did not expect to see an envelope lying on top of them. A\nsquare envelope, belonging, in fact, to the ship’s stationery.\n\nIt lay so that I could see it was not closed down, and on picking it\nup and turning it over I perceived that it was addressed to myself. It\ncontained a half-sheet of notepaper, which I unfolded with a queer sense\nof dealing with the uncanny, but without any excitement as people meet\nand do extraordinary things in a dream.\n\n“My dear Captain,” it began, but I ran to the signature. The writer was\nthe doctor. The date was that of the day on which, returning from my\nvisit to Mr. Burns in the hospital, I had found the excellent doctor\nwaiting for me in the cabin; and when he told me that he had been\nputting in time inspecting the medicine chest for me. How bizarre! While\nexpecting me to come in at any moment he had been amusing himself by\nwriting me a letter, and then as I came in had hastened to stuff it into\nthe medicine-chest drawer. A rather incredible proceeding. I turned to\nthe text in wonder.\n\nIn a large, hurried, but legible hand the good, sympathetic man for some\nreason, either of kindness or more likely impelled by the irresistible\ndesire to express his opinion, with which he didn’t want to damp my\nhopes before, was warning me not to put my trust in the beneficial\neffects of a change from land to sea. “I didn’t want to add to your\nworries by discouraging your hopes,” he wrote. “I am afraid that,\nmedically speaking, the end of your troubles is not yet.” In short,\nhe expected me to have to fight a probable return of tropical illness.\nFortunately I had a good provision of quinine. I should put my trust in\nthat, and administer it steadily, when the ship’s health would certainly\nimprove.\n\nI crumpled up the letter and rammed it into my pocket. Ransome carried\noff two big doses to the men forward. As to myself, I did not go on deck\nas yet. I went instead to the door of Mr. Burns’ room, and gave him that\nnews, too.\n\nIt was impossible to say the effect it had on him. At first I thought\nthat he was speechless. His head lay sunk in the pillow. He moved his\nlips enough, however, to assure me that he was getting much stronger; a\nstatement shockingly untrue on the face of it.\n\nThat afternoon I took my watch as a matter of course. A great\nover-heated stillness enveloped the ship and seemed to hold her\nmotionless in a flaming ambience composed in two shades of blue. Faint,\nhot puffs eddied nervelessly from her sails. And yet she moved. She must\nhave. For, as the sun was setting, we had drawn abreast of Cape Liant\nand dropped it behind us: an ominous retreating shadow in the last\ngleams of twilight.\n\nIn the evening, under the crude glare of his lamp, Mr. Burns seemed to\nhave come more to the surface of his bedding. It was as if a\ndepressing hand had been lifted off him. He answered my few words by a\ncomparatively long, connected speech. He asserted himself strongly.\nIf he escaped being smothered by this stagnant heat, he said, he was\nconfident that in a very few days he would be able to come up on deck\nand help me.\n\nWhile he was speaking I trembled lest this effort of energy should leave\nhim lifeless before my eyes. But I cannot deny that there was something\ncomforting in his willingness. I made a suitable reply, but pointed out\nto him that the only thing that could really help us was wind--a fair\nwind.\n\nHe rolled his head impatiently on the pillow. And it was not comforting\nin the least to hear him begin to mutter crazily about the late captain,\nthat old man buried in latitude 8 d 20’, right in our way--ambushed at\nthe entrance of the Gulf.\n\n“Are you still thinking of your late captain, Mr. Burns?” I said. “I\nimagine the dead feel no animosity against the living. They care nothing\nfor them.”\n\n“You don’t know that one,” he breathed out feebly.\n\n“No. I didn’t know him, and he didn’t know me. And so he can’t have any\ngrievance against me, anyway.”\n\n“Yes. But there’s all the rest of us on board,” he insisted.\n\nI felt the inexpugnable strength of common sense being insidiously\nmenaced by this gruesome, by this insane, delusion. And I said:\n\n“You mustn’t talk so much. You will tire yourself.”\n\n“And there is the ship herself,” he persisted in a whisper.\n\n“Now, not a word more,” I said, stepping in and laying my hand on his\ncool forehead. It proved to me that this atrocious absurdity was rooted\nin the man himself and not in the disease, which, apparently, had\nemptied him of every power, mental and physical, except that one fixed\nidea.\n\nI avoided giving Mr. Burns any opening for conversation for the next few\ndays. I merely used to throw him a hasty, cheery word when passing his\ndoor. I believe that if he had had the strength he would have called out\nafter me more than once. But he hadn’t the strength. Ransome, however,\nobserved to me one afternoon that the mate “seemed to be picking up\nwonderfully.”\n\n“Did he talk any nonsense to you of late?” I asked casually.\n\n“No, sir.” Ransome was startled by the direct question; but, after a\npause, he added equably: “He told me this morning, sir, that he was\nsorry he had to bury our late captain right in the ship’s way, as one\nmay say, out of the Gulf.”\n\n“Isn’t this nonsense enough for you?” I asked, looking confidently at\nthe intelligent, quiet face on which the secret uneasiness in the man’s\nbreast had thrown a transparent veil of care.\n\nRansome didn’t know. He had not given a thought to the matter. And with\na faint smile he flitted away from me on his never-ending duties, with\nhis usual guarded activity.\n\nTwo more days passed. We had advanced a little way--a very little\nway--into the larger space of the Gulf of Siam. Seizing eagerly upon\nthe elation of the first command thrown into my lap, by the agency of\nCaptain Giles, I had yet an uneasy feeling that such luck as this has\ngot perhaps to be paid for in some way. I had held, professionally,\na review of my chances. I was competent enough for that. At least, I\nthought so. I had a general sense of my preparedness which only a man\npursuing a calling he loves can know. That feeling seemed to me the most\nnatural thing in the world. As natural as breathing. I imagined I could\nnot have lived without it.\n\nI don’t know what I expected. Perhaps nothing else than that\nspecial intensity of existence which is the quintessence of youthful\naspirations. Whatever I expected I did not expect to be beset by\nhurricanes. I knew better than that. In the Gulf of Siam there are no\nhurricanes. But neither did I expect to find myself bound hand and foot\nto the hopeless extent which was revealed to me as the days went on.\n\nNot that the evil spell held us always motionless. Mysterious currents\ndrifted us here and there, with a stealthy power made manifest only by\nthe changing vistas of the islands fringing the east shore of the Gulf.\nAnd there were winds, too, fitful and deceitful. They raised hopes only\nto dash them into the bitterest disappointment, promises of advance\nending in lost ground, expiring in sighs, dying into dumb stillness in\nwhich the currents had it all their own way--their own inimical way.\n\nThe island of Koh-ring, a great, black, upheaved ridge amongst a lot of\ntiny islets, lying upon the glassy water like a triton amongst minnows,\nseemed to be the centre of the fatal circle. It seemed impossible to get\naway from it. Day after day it remained in sight. More than once, in\na favourable breeze, I would take its bearings in the fast-ebbing\ntwilight, thinking that it was for the last time. Vain hope. A night of\nfitful airs would undo the gains of temporary favour, and the rising\nsun would throw out the black relief of Koh-ring looking more barren,\ninhospitable, and grim than ever.\n\n“It’s like being bewitched, upon my word,” I said once to Mr. Burns,\nfrom my usual position in the doorway.\n\nHe was sitting up in his bed-place. He was progressing toward the world\nof living men; if he could hardly have been said to have rejoined it\nyet. He nodded to me his frail and bony head in a wisely mysterious\nassent.\n\n“Oh, yes, I know what you mean,” I said. “But you cannot expect me\nto believe that a dead man has the power to put out of joint the\nmeteorology of this part of the world. Though indeed it seems to have\ngone utterly wrong. The land and sea breezes have got broken up into\nsmall pieces. We cannot depend upon them for five minutes together.”\n\n“It won’t be very long now before I can come up on deck,” muttered Mr.\nBurns, “and then we shall see.”\n\nWhether he meant this for a promise to grapple with supernatural evil I\ncouldn’t tell. At any rate, it wasn’t the kind of assistance I needed.\nOn the other hand, I had been living on deck practically night and day\nso as to take advantage of every chance to get my ship a little more to\nthe southward. The mate, I could see, was extremely weak yet, and not\nquite rid of his delusion, which to me appeared but a symptom of his\ndisease. At all events, the hopefulness of an invalid was not to be\ndiscouraged. I said:\n\n“You will be most welcome there, I am sure, Mr. Burns. If you go on\nimproving at this rate you’ll be presently one of the healthiest men in\nthe ship.”\n\nThis pleased him, but his extreme emaciation converted his\nself-satisfied smile into a ghastly exhibition of long teeth under the\nred moustache.\n\n“Aren’t the fellows improving, sir?” he asked soberly, with an extremely\nsensible expression of anxiety on his face.\n\nI answered him only with a vague gesture and went away from the door.\nThe fact was that disease played with us capriciously very much as the\nwinds did. It would go from one man to another with a lighter or heavier\ntouch, which always left its mark behind, staggering some, knocking\nothers over for a time, leaving this one, returning to another, so that\nall of them had now an invalidish aspect and a hunted, apprehensive look\nin their eyes; while Ransome and I, the only two completely untouched,\nwent amongst them assiduously distributing quinine. It was a double\nfight. The adverse weather held us in front and the disease pressed on\nour rear. I must say that the men were very good. The constant toil of\ntrimming yards they faced willingly. But all spring was out of their\nlimbs, and as I looked at them from the poop I could not keep from my\nmind the dreadful impression that they were moving in poisoned air.\n\nDown below, in his cabin, Mr. Burns had advanced so far as not only to\nbe able to sit up, but even to draw up his legs. Clasping them with bony\narms, like an animated skeleton, he emitted deep, impatient sighs.\n\n“The great thing to do, sir,” he would tell me on every occasion, when I\ngave him the chance, “the great thing is to get the ship past 8 d 20’ of\nlatitude. Once she’s past that we’re all right.”\n\nAt first I used only to smile at him, though, God knows, I had not much\nheart left for smiles. But at last I lost my patience.\n\n“Oh, yes. The latitude 8 d 20’. That’s where you buried your late\ncaptain, isn’t it?” Then with severity: “Don’t you think, Mr. Burns,\nit’s about time you dropped all that nonsense?”\n\nHe rolled at me his deep-sunken eyes in a glance of invincible\nobstinacy. But for the rest he only muttered, just loud enough for me\nto hear, something about “Not surprised . . . find . . . play us some\nbeastly trick yet. . . .”\n\nSuch passages as this were not exactly wholesome for my resolution. The\nstress of adversity was beginning to tell on me. At the same time, I\nfelt a contempt for that obscure weakness of my soul. I said to myself\ndisdainfully that it should take much more than that to affect in the\nsmallest degree my fortitude.\n\nI didn’t know then how soon and from what unexpected direction it would\nbe attacked.\n\nIt was the very next day. The sun had risen clear of the southern\nshoulder of Koh-ring, which still hung, like an evil attendant, on our\nport quarter. It was intensely hateful to my sight. During the night\nwe had been heading all round the compass, trimming the yards again and\nagain, to what I fear must have been for the most part imaginary puffs\nof air. Then just about sunrise we got for an hour an inexplicable,\nsteady breeze, right in our teeth. There was no sense in it. It fitted\nneither with the season of the year nor with the secular experience\nof seamen as recorded in books, nor with the aspect of the sky. Only\npurposeful malevolence could account for it. It sent us travelling at\na great pace away from our proper course; and if we had been out on\npleasure sailing bent it would have been a delightful breeze, with the\nawakened sparkle of the sea, with the sense of motion and a feeling of\nunwonted freshness. Then, all at once, as if disdaining to carry farther\nthe sorry jest, it dropped and died out completely in less than five\nminutes. The ship’s head swung where it listed; the stilled sea took on\nthe polish of a steel plate in the calm.\n\nI went below, not because I meant to take some rest, but simply because\nI couldn’t bear to look at it just then. The indefatigable Ransome was\nbusy in the saloon. It had become a regular practice with him to give\nme an informal health report in the morning. He turned away from the\nsideboard with his usual pleasant, quiet gaze. No shadow rested on his\nintelligent forehead.\n\n“There are a good many of them middling bad this morning, sir,” he said\nin a calm tone.\n\n“What? All knocked out?”\n\n“Only two actually in their bunks, sir, but--”\n\n“It’s the last night that has done for them. We have had to pull and\nhaul all the blessed time.”\n\n“I heard, sir. I had a mind to come out and help only, you know. . . .”\n\n“Certainly not. You mustn’t. . . . The fellows lie at night about the\ndecks, too. It isn’t good for them.”\n\nRansome assented. But men couldn’t be looked after like children.\nMoreover, one could hardly blame them for trying for such coolness and\nsuch air as there was to be found on deck. He himself, of course, knew\nbetter.\n\nHe was, indeed, a reasonable man. Yet it would have been hard to say\nthat the others were not. The last few days had been for us like the\nordeal of the fiery furnace. One really couldn’t quarrel with their\ncommon, imprudent humanity making the best of the moments of relief,\nwhen the night brought in the illusion of coolness and the starlight\ntwinkled through the heavy, dew-laden air. Moreover, most of them were\nso weakened that hardly anything could be done without everybody that\ncould totter mustering on the braces. No, it was no use remonstrating\nwith them. But I fully believed that quinine was of very great use\nindeed.\n\nI believed in it. I pinned my faith to it. It would save the men, the\nship, break the spell by its medicinal virtue, make time of no account,\nthe weather but a passing worry and, like a magic powder working against\nmysterious malefices, secure the first passage of my first command\nagainst the evil powers of calms and pestilence. I looked upon it as\nmore precious than gold, and unlike gold, of which there ever hardly\nseems to be enough anywhere, the ship had a sufficient store of it. I\nwent in to get it with the purpose of weighing out doses. I stretched my\nhand with the feeling of a man reaching for an unfailing panacea, took\nup a fresh bottle and unrolled the wrapper, noticing as I did so that\nthe ends, both top and bottom, had come unsealed. . . .\n\nBut why record all the swift steps of the appalling discovery? You have\nguessed the truth already. There was the wrapper, the bottle, and the\nwhite powder inside, some sort of powder! But it wasn’t quinine. One\nlook at it was quite enough. I remember that at the very moment of\npicking up the bottle, before I even dealt with the wrapper, the weight\nof the object I had in my hand gave me an instant premonition. Quinine\nis as light as feathers; and my nerves must have been exasperated into\nan extraordinary sensibility. I let the bottle smash itself on the\nfloor. The stuff, whatever it was, felt gritty under the sole of my\nshoe. I snatched up the next bottle and then the next. The weight alone\ntold the tale. One after another they fell, breaking at my feet, not\nbecause I threw them down in my dismay, but slipping through my fingers\nas if this disclosure were too much for my strength.\n\nIt is a fact that the very greatness of a mental shock helps one to bear\nup against it by producing a sort of temporary insensibility. I came out\nof the state-room stunned, as if something heavy had dropped on my head.\nFrom the other side of the saloon, across the table, Ransome, with a\nduster in his hand, stared open-mouthed. I don’t think that I looked\nwild. It is quite possible that I appeared to be in a hurry because\nI was instinctively hastening up on deck. An example this of training\nbecome instinct. The difficulties, the dangers, the problems of a ship\nat sea must be met on deck.\n\nTo this fact, as it were of nature, I responded instinctively; which\nmay be taken as a proof that for a moment I must have been robbed of my\nreason.\n\nI was certainly off my balance, a prey to impulse, for at the bottom of\nthe stairs I turned and flung myself at the doorway of Mr. Burns’ cabin.\nThe wildness of his aspect checked my mental disorder. He was sitting up\nin his bunk, his body looking immensely long, his head drooping a little\nsideways, with affected complacency. He flourished, in his trembling\nhand, on the end of a forearm no thicker than a walking-stick, a shining\npair of scissors which he tried before my very eyes to jab at his\nthroat.\n\nI was to a certain extent horrified; but it was rather a secondary sort\nof effect, not really strong enough to make me yell at him in some such\nmanner as: “Stop!” . . . “Heavens!” . . . “What are you doing?”\n\nIn reality he was simply overtaxing his returning strength in a shaky\nattempt to clip off the thick growth of his red beard. A large towel was\nspread over his lap, and a shower of stiff hairs, like bits of copper\nwire, was descending on it at every snip of the scissors.\n\nHe turned to me his face grotesque beyond the fantasies of mad dreams,\none cheek all bushy as if with a swollen flame, the other denuded and\nsunken, with the untouched long moustache on that side asserting itself,\nlonely and fierce. And while he stared thunderstruck, with the gaping\nscissors on his fingers, I shouted my discovery at him fiendishly, in\nsix words, without comment.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nI heard the clatter of the scissors escaping from his hand, noted the\nperilous heave of his whole person over the edge of the bunk after them,\nand then, returning to my first purpose, pursued my course on the deck.\nThe sparkle of the sea filled my eyes. It was gorgeous and barren,\nmonotonous and without hope under the empty curve of the sky. The sails\nhung motionless and slack, the very folds of their sagging surfaces\nmoved no more than carved granite. The impetuosity of my advent made the\nman at the helm start slightly. A block aloft squeaked incomprehensibly,\nfor what on earth could have made it do so? It was a whistling note like\na bird’s. For a long, long time I faced an empty world, steeped in an\ninfinity of silence, through which the sunshine poured and flowed for\nsome mysterious purpose. Then I heard Ransome’s voice at my elbow.\n\n“I have put Mr. Burns back to bed, sir.”\n\n“You have.”\n\n“Well, sir, he got out, all of a sudden, but when he let go the edge of\nhis bunk he fell down. He isn’t light-headed, though, it seems to me.”\n\n“No,” I said dully, without looking at Ransome. He waited for a moment,\nthen cautiously, as if not to give offence: “I don’t think we need lose\nmuch of that stuff, sir,” he said, “I can sweep it up, every bit of\nit almost, and then we could sift the glass out. I will go about it at\nonce. It will not make the breakfast late, not ten minutes.”\n\n“Oh, yes,” I said bitterly. “Let the breakfast wait, sweep up every bit\nof it, and then throw the damned lot overboard!”\n\nThe profound silence returned, and when I looked over my shoulder,\nRansome--the intelligent, serene Ransome--had vanished from my side.\nThe intense loneliness of the sea acted like poison on my brain. When I\nturned my eyes to the ship, I had a morbid vision of her as a floating\ngrave. Who hasn’t heard of ships found floating, haphazard, with their\ncrews all dead? I looked at the seaman at the helm, I had an impulse to\nspeak to him, and, indeed, his face took on an expectant cast as if he\nhad guessed my intention. But in the end I went below, thinking I\nwould be alone with the greatness of my trouble for a little while.\nBut through his open door Mr. Burns saw me come down, and addressed me\ngrumpily: “Well, sir?”\n\nI went in. “It isn’t well at all,” I said.\n\nMr. Burns, reestablished in his bed-place, was concealing his hirsute\ncheek in the palm of his hand.\n\n“That confounded fellow has taken away the scissors from me,” were the\nnext words he said.\n\nThe tension I was suffering from was so great that it was perhaps just\nas well that Mr. Burns had started on his grievance. He seemed very sore\nabout it and grumbled, “Does he think I am mad, or what?”\n\n“I don’t think so, Mr. Burns,” I said. I looked upon him at that moment\nas a model of self-possession. I even conceived on that account a sort of\nadmiration for that man, who had (apart from the intense materiality of\nwhat was left of his beard) come as near to being a disembodied spirit\nas any man can do and live. I noticed the preternatural sharpness of the\nridge of his nose, the deep cavities of his temples, and I envied him.\nHe was so reduced that he would probably die very soon. Enviable man!\nSo near extinction--while I had to bear within me a tumult of suffering\nvitality, doubt, confusion, self-reproach, and an indefinite reluctance\nto meet the horrid logic of the situation. I could not help muttering:\n“I feel as if I were going mad myself.”\n\nMr. Burns glared spectrally, but otherwise was wonderfully composed.\n\n“I always thought he would play us some deadly trick,” he said, with a\npeculiar emphasis on the _he_.\n\nIt gave me a mental shock, but I had neither the mind, nor the heart,\nnor the spirit to argue with him. My form of sickness was indifference.\nThe creeping paralysis of a hopeless outlook. So I only gazed at him.\nMr. Burns broke into further speech.\n\n“Eh! What! No! You won’t believe it? Well, how do you account for this?\nHow do you think it could have happened?”\n\n“Happened?” I repeated dully. “Why, yes, how in the name of the infernal\npowers did this thing happen?”\n\nIndeed, on thinking it out, it seemed incomprehensible that it should\njust be like this: the bottles emptied, refilled, rewrapped, and\nreplaced. A sort of plot, a sinister attempt to deceive, a thing\nresembling sly vengeance, but for what? Or else a fiendish joke. But Mr.\nBurns was in possession of a theory. It was simple, and he uttered it\nsolemnly in a hollow voice.\n\n“I suppose they have given him about fifteen pounds in Haiphong for that\nlittle lot.”\n\n“Mr. Burns!” I cried.\n\nHe nodded grotesquely over his raised legs, like two broomsticks in the\npyjamas, with enormous bare feet at the end.\n\n“Why not? The stuff is pretty expensive in this part of the world, and\nthey were very short of it in Tonkin. And what did he care? You have\nnot known him. I have, and I have defied him. He feared neither God, nor\ndevil, nor man, nor wind, nor sea, nor his own conscience. And I believe\nhe hated everybody and everything. But I think he was afraid to die. I\nbelieve I am the only man who ever stood up to him. I faced him in that\ncabin where you live now, when he was sick, and I cowed him then. He\nthought I was going to twist his neck for him. If he had had his way we\nwould have been beating up against the Nord-East monsoon, as long as he\nlived and afterward, too, for ages and ages. Acting the Flying Dutchman\nin the China Sea! Ha! Ha!”\n\n“But why should he replace the bottles like this?” . . . I began.\n\n“Why shouldn’t he? Why should he want to throw the bottles away? They\nfit the drawer. They belong to the medicine chest.”\n\n“And they were wrapped up,” I cried.\n\n“Well, the wrappers were there. Did it from habit, I suppose, and as\nto refilling, there is always a lot of stuff they send in paper parcels\nthat burst after a time. And then, who can tell? I suppose you didn’t\ntaste it, sir? But, of course, you are sure. . . .”\n\n“No,” I said. “I didn’t taste it. It is all overboard now.”\n\nBehind me, a soft, cultivated voice said: “I have tasted it. It seemed a\nmixture of all sorts, sweetish, saltish, very horrible.”\n\nRansome, stepping out of the pantry, had been listening for some time,\nas it was very excusable in him to do.\n\n“A dirty trick,” said Mr. Burns. “I always said he would.”\n\nThe magnitude of my indignation was unbounded. And the kind, sympathetic\ndoctor, too. The only sympathetic man I ever knew . . . instead of\nwriting that warning letter, the very refinement of sympathy, why didn’t\nthe man make a proper inspection? But, as a matter of fact, it was\nhardly fair to blame the doctor. The fittings were in order and the\nmedicine chest is an officially arranged affair. There was nothing\nreally to arouse the slightest suspicion. The person I could never\nforgive was myself. Nothing should ever be taken for granted. The seed\nof everlasting remorse was sown in my breast.\n\n“I feel it’s all my fault,” I exclaimed, “mine and nobody else’s. That’s\nhow I feel. I shall never forgive myself.”\n\n“That’s very foolish, sir,” said Mr. Burns fiercely.\n\nAnd after this effort he fell back exhausted on his bed. He closed his\neyes, he panted; this affair, this abominable surprise had shaken him\nup, too. As I turned away I perceived Ransome looking at me blankly. He\nappreciated what it meant, but managed to produce his pleasant, wistful\nsmile. Then he stepped back into his pantry, and I rushed up on deck\nagain to see whether there was any wind, any breath under the sky, any\nstir of the air, any sign of hope. The deadly stillness met me again.\nNothing was changed except that there was a different man at the wheel.\nHe looked ill. His whole figure drooped, and he seemed rather to cling\nto the spokes than hold them with a controlling grip. I said to him:\n\n“You are not fit to be here.”\n\n“I can manage, sir,” he said feebly.\n\nAs a matter of fact, there was nothing for him to do. The ship had no\nsteerage way. She lay with her head to the westward, the everlasting\nKoh-ring visible over the stern, with a few small islets, black spots\nin the great blaze, swimming before my troubled eyes. And but for those\nbits of land there was no speck on the sky, no speck on the water,\nno shape of vapour, no wisp of smoke, no sail, no boat, no stir of\nhumanity, no sign of life, nothing!\n\nThe first question was, what to do? What could one do? The first thing\nto do obviously was to tell the men. I did it that very day. I wasn’t\ngoing to let the knowledge simply get about. I would face them. They\nwere assembled on the quarterdeck for the purpose. Just before I stepped\nout to speak to them I discovered that life could hold terrible moments.\nNo confessed criminal had ever been so oppressed by his sense of\nguilt. This is why, perhaps, my face was set hard and my voice curt and\nunemotional while I made my declaration that I could do nothing more\nfor the sick in the way of drugs. As to such care as could be given them\nthey knew they had had it.\n\nI would have held them justified in tearing me limb from limb. The\nsilence which followed upon my words was almost harder to bear than the\nangriest uproar. I was crushed by the infinite depth of its reproach.\nBut, as a matter of fact, I was mistaken. In a voice which I had\ngreat difficulty in keeping firm, I went on: “I suppose, men, you have\nunderstood what I said, and you know what it means.”\n\nA voice or two were heard: “Yes, sir. . . . We understand.”\n\nThey had kept silent simply because they thought that they were not\ncalled to say anything; and when I told them that I intended to run into\nSingapore and that the best chance for the ship and the men was in the\nefforts all of us, sick and well, must make to get her along out of\nthis, I received the encouragement of a low assenting murmur and of\na louder voice exclaiming: “Surely there is a way out of this blamed\nhole.”\n\n*****\n\nHere is an extract from the notes I wrote at the time.\n\n“We have lost Koh-ring at last. For many days now I don’t think I have\nbeen two hours below altogether. I remain on deck, of course, night and\nday, and the nights and the days wheel over us in succession, whether\nlong or short, who can say? All sense of time is lost in the monotony of\nexpectation, of hope, and of desire--which is only one: Get the ship to\nthe southward! Get the ship to the southward! The effect is curiously\nmechanical; the sun climbs and descends, the night swings over our\nheads as if somebody below the horizon were turning a crank. It is\nthe prettiest, the most aimless! . . . and all through that miserable\nperformance I go on, tramping, tramping the deck. How many miles have\nI walked on the poop of that ship! A stubborn pilgrimage of sheer\nrestlessness, diversified by short excursions below to look upon Mr.\nBurns. I don’t know whether it is an illusion, but he seems to become\nmore substantial from day to day. He doesn’t say much, for, indeed, the\nsituation doesn’t lend itself to idle remarks. I notice this even with\nthe men as I watch them moving or sitting about the decks. They don’t\ntalk to each other. It strikes me that if there exists an invisible\near catching the whispers of the earth, it will find this ship the most\nsilent spot on it. . . .\n\n“No, Mr. Burns has not much to say to me. He sits in his bunk with\nhis beard gone, his moustaches flaming, and with an air of silent\ndetermination on his chalky physiognomy. Ransome tells me he devours all\nthe food that is given him to the last scrap, but that, apparently, he\nsleeps very little. Even at night, when I go below to fill my pipe,\nI notice that, though dozing flat on his back, he still looks very\ndetermined. From the side glance he gives me when awake it seems as\nthough he were annoyed at being interrupted in some arduous mental\noperation; and as I emerge on deck the ordered arrangement of the stars\nmeets my eye, unclouded, infinitely wearisome. There they are: stars,\nsun, sea, light, darkness, space, great waters; the formidable Work of\nthe Seven Days, into which mankind seems to have blundered unbidden.\nOr else decoyed. Even as I have been decoyed into this awful, this\ndeath-haunted command. . . .”\n\n*****\n\nThe only spot of light in the ship at night was that of the\ncompass-lamps, lighting up the faces of the succeeding helmsmen; for the\nrest we were lost in the darkness, I walking the poop and the men lying\nabout the decks. They were all so reduced by sickness that no watches\ncould be kept. Those who were able to walk remained all the time on\nduty, lying about in the shadows of the main deck, till my voice raised\nfor an order would bring them to their enfeebled feet, a tottering\nlittle group, moving patiently about the ship, with hardly a murmur, a\nwhisper amongst them all. And every time I had to raise my voice it was\nwith a pang of remorse and pity.\n\nThen about four o’clock in the morning a light would gleam forward in\nthe galley. The unfailing Ransome with the uneasy heart, immune,\nserene, and active, was getting ready for the early coffee for the men.\nPresently he would bring me a cup up on the poop, and it was then that I\nallowed myself to drop into my deck chair for a couple of hours of real\nsleep. No doubt I must have been snatching short dozes when leaning\nagainst the rail for a moment in sheer exhaustion; but, honestly, I was\nnot aware of them, except in the painful form of convulsive starts that\nseemed to come on me even while I walked. From about five, however,\nuntil after seven I would sleep openly under the fading stars.\n\nI would say to the helmsman: “Call me at need,” and drop into that chair\nand close my eyes, feeling that there was no more sleep for me on earth.\nAnd then I would know nothing till, some time between seven and eight,\nI would feel a touch on my shoulder and look up at Ransome’s face, with\nits faint, wistful smile and friendly, gray eyes, as though he were\ntenderly amused at my slumbers. Occasionally the second mate would come\nup and relieve me at early coffee time. But it didn’t really matter.\nGenerally it was a dead calm, or else faint airs so changing and\nfugitive that it really wasn’t worth while to touch a brace for them.\nIf the air steadied at all the seaman at the helm could be trusted for\na warning shout: “Ship’s all aback, sir!” which like a trumpet-call would\nmake me spring a foot above the deck. Those were the words which it\nseemed to me would have made me spring up from eternal sleep. But this\nwas not often. I have never met since such breathless sunrises. And if\nthe second mate happened to be there (he had generally one day in three\nfree of fever) I would find him sitting on the skylight half senseless,\nas it were, and with an idiotic gaze fastened on some object near by--a\nrope, a cleat, a belaying pin, a ringbolt.\n\nThat young man was rather troublesome. He remained cubbish in his\nsufferings. He seemed to have become completely imbecile; and when the\nreturn of fever drove him to his cabin below, the next thing would be\nthat we would miss him from there. The first time it happened Ransome\nand I were very much alarmed. We started a quiet search and ultimately\nRansome discovered him curled up in the sail-locker, which opened\ninto the lobby by a sliding door. When remonstrated with, he muttered\nsulkily, “It’s cool in there.” That wasn’t true. It was only dark there.\n\nThe fundamental defects of his face were not improved by its uniform\nlivid hue. The disease disclosed its low type in a startling way. It was\nnot so with many of the men. The wastage of ill-health seemed to idealise\nthe general character of the features, bringing out the unsuspected\nnobility of some, the strength of others, and in one case revealing an\nessentially comic aspect. He was a short, gingery, active man with\na nose and chin of the Punch type, and whom his shipmates called\n“Frenchy.” I don’t know why. He may have been a Frenchman, but I have\nnever heard him utter a single word in French.\n\nTo see him coming aft to the wheel comforted one. The blue dungaree\ntrousers turned up the calf, one leg a little higher than the other, the\nclean check shirt, the white canvas cap, evidently made by himself, made\nup a whole of peculiar smartness, and the persistent jauntiness of his\ngait, even, poor fellow, when he couldn’t help tottering, told of his\ninvincible spirit. There was also a man called Gambril. He was the only\ngrizzled person in the ship. His face was of an austere type. But if\nI remember all their faces, wasting tragically before my eyes, most of\ntheir names have vanished from my memory.\n\nThe words that passed between us were few and puerile in regard of the\nsituation. I had to force myself to look them in the face. I expected to\nmeet reproachful glances. There were none. The expression of suffering\nin their eyes was indeed hard enough to bear. But that they couldn’t\nhelp. For the rest, I ask myself whether it was the temper of their\nsouls or the sympathy of their imagination that made them so wonderful,\nso worthy of my undying regard.\n\nFor myself, neither my soul was highly tempered, nor my imagination\nproperly under control. There were moments when I felt, not only that I\nwould go mad, but that I had gone mad already; so that I dared not open\nmy lips for fear of betraying myself by some insane shriek. Luckily I\nhad only orders to give, and an order has a steadying influence upon him\nwho has to give it. Moreover, the seaman, the officer of the watch, in\nme was sufficiently sane. I was like a mad carpenter making a box. Were\nhe ever so convinced that he was King of Jerusalem, the box he would\nmake would be a sane box. What I feared was a shrill note escaping me\ninvoluntarily and upsetting my balance. Luckily, again, there was no\nnecessity to raise one’s voice. The brooding stillness of the world\nseemed sensitive to the slightest sound, like a whispering gallery. The\nconversational tone would almost carry a word from one end of the ship\nto the other. The terrible thing was that the only voice that I ever\nheard was my own. At night especially it reverberated very lonely\namongst the planes of the unstirring sails.\n\nMr. Burns, still keeping to his bed with that air of secret\ndetermination, was moved to grumble at many things. Our interviews\nwere short five-minute affairs, but fairly frequent. I was everlastingly\ndiving down below to get a light, though I did not consume much tobacco\nat that time. The pipe was always going out; for in truth my mind was\nnot composed enough to enable me to get a decent smoke. Likewise,\nfor most of the time during the twenty-four hours I could have struck\nmatches on deck and held them aloft till the flame burnt my fingers. But\nI always used to run below. It was a change. It was the only break in\nthe incessant strain; and, of course, Mr. Burns through the open door\ncould see me come in and go out every time.\n\nWith his knees gathered up under his chin and staring with his greenish\neyes over them, he was a weird figure, and with my knowledge of the\ncrazy notion in his head, not a very attractive one for me. Still, I had\nto speak to him now and then, and one day he complained that the ship\nwas very silent. For hours and hours, he said, he was lying there, not\nhearing a sound, till he did not know what to do with himself.\n\n“When Ransome happens to be forward in his galley everything’s so still\nthat one might think everybody in the ship was dead,” he grumbled. “The\nonly voice I do hear sometimes is yours, sir, and that isn’t enough to\ncheer me up. What’s the matter with the men? Isn’t there one left that\ncan sing out at the ropes?”\n\n“Not one, Mr. Burns,” I said. “There is no breath to spare on board this\nship for that. Are you aware that there are times when I can’t muster\nmore than three hands to do anything?”\n\nHe asked swiftly but fearfully:\n\n“Nobody dead yet, sir?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“It wouldn’t do,” Mr. Burns declared forcibly. “Mustn’t let him. If he\ngets hold of one he will get them all.”\n\nI cried out angrily at this. I believe I even swore at the disturbing\neffect of these words. They attacked all the self-possession that was\nleft to me. In my endless vigil in the face of the enemy I had been\nhaunted by gruesome images enough. I had had visions of a ship drifting\nin calms and swinging in light airs, with all her crew dying slowly\nabout her decks. Such things had been known to happen.\n\nMr. Burns met my outburst by a mysterious silence.\n\n“Look here,” I said. “You don’t believe yourself what you say. You\ncan’t. It’s impossible. It isn’t the sort of thing I have a right to\nexpect from you. My position’s bad enough without being worried with\nyour silly fancies.”\n\nHe remained unmoved. On account of the way in which the light fell on\nhis head I could not be sure whether he had smiled faintly or not. I\nchanged my tone.\n\n“Listen,” I said. “It’s getting so desperate that I had thought for a\nmoment, since we can’t make our way south, whether I wouldn’t try to\nsteer west and make an attempt to reach the mailboat track. We could\nalways get some quinine from her, at least. What do you think?”\n\nHe cried out: “No, no, no. Don’t do that, sir. You mustn’t for a moment\ngive up facing that old ruffian. If you do he will get the upper hand of\nus.”\n\nI left him. He was impossible. It was like a case of possession. His\nprotest, however, was essentially quite sound. As a matter of fact, my\nnotion of heading out west on the chance of sighting a problematical\nsteamer could not bear calm examination. On the side where we were we\nhad enough wind, at least from time to time, to struggle on toward the\nsouth. Enough, at least, to keep hope alive. But suppose that I had used\nthose capricious gusts of wind to sail away to the westward, into some\nregion where there was not a breath of air for days on end, what then?\nPerhaps my appalling vision of a ship floating with a dead crew\nwould become a reality for the discovery weeks afterward by some\nhorror-stricken mariners.\n\nThat afternoon Ransome brought me up a cup of tea, and while waiting\nthere, tray in hand, he remarked in the exactly right tone of sympathy:\n\n“You are holding out well, sir.”\n\n“Yes,” I said. “You and I seem to have been forgotten.”\n\n“Forgotten, sir?”\n\n“Yes, by the fever-devil who has got on board this ship,” I said.\n\nRansome gave me one of his attractive, intelligent, quick glances and\nwent away with the tray. It occurred to me that I had been talking\nsomewhat in Mr. Burns’ manner. It annoyed me. Yet often in darker\nmoments I forgot myself into an attitude toward our troubles more fit\nfor a contest against a living enemy.\n\nYes. The fever-devil had not laid his hand yet either on Ransome or on\nme. But he might at any time. It was one of those thoughts one had\nto fight down, keep at arm’s length at any cost. It was unbearable to\ncontemplate the possibility of Ransome, the housekeeper of the ship,\nbeing laid low. And what would happen to my command if I got knocked\nover, with Mr. Burns too weak to stand without holding on to his\nbed-place and the second mate reduced to a state of permanent\nimbecility? It was impossible to imagine, or rather, it was only too\neasy to imagine.\n\nI was alone on the poop. The ship having no steerage way, I had sent the\nhelmsman away to sit down or lie down somewhere in the shade. The men’s\nstrength was so reduced that all unnecessary calls on it had to be\navoided. It was the austere Gambril with the grizzly beard. He went away\nreadily enough, but he was so weakened by repeated bouts of fever,\npoor fellow, that in order to get down the poop ladder he had to turn\nsideways and hang on with both hands to the brass rail. It was just\nsimply heart-breaking to watch. Yet he was neither very much worse nor\nmuch better than most of the half-dozen miserable victims I could muster\nup on deck.\n\nIt was a terribly lifeless afternoon. For several days in succession low\nclouds had appeared in the distance, white masses with dark convolutions\nresting on the water, motionless, almost solid, and yet all the time\nchanging their aspects subtly. Toward evening they vanished as a rule.\nBut this day they awaited the setting sun, which glowed and smouldered\nsulkily amongst them before it sank down. The punctual and wearisome\nstars reappeared over our mastheads, but the air remained stagnant and\noppressive.\n\nThe unfailing Ransome lighted the binnaclelamps and glided, all shadowy,\nup to me.\n\n“Will you go down and try to eat something, sir?” he suggested.\n\nHis low voice startled me. I had been standing looking out over the\nrail, saying nothing, feeling nothing, not even the weariness of my\nlimbs, overcome by the evil spell.\n\n“Ransome,” I asked abruptly, “how long have I been on deck? I am losing\nthe notion of time.”\n\n“Twelve days, sir,” he said, “and it’s just a fortnight since we left\nthe anchorage.”\n\nHis equable voice sounded mournful somehow. He waited a bit, then added:\n“It’s the first time that it looks as if we were to have some rain.”\n\nI noticed then the broad shadow on the horizon, extinguishing the low\nstars completely, while those overhead, when I looked up, seemed to\nshine down on us through a veil of smoke.\n\nHow it got there, how it had crept up so high, I couldn’t say. It had an\nominous appearance. The air did not stir. At a renewed invitation from\nRansome I did go down into the cabin to--in his own words--“try and eat\nsomething.” I don’t know that the trial was very successful. I suppose\nat that period I did exist on food in the usual way; but the memory is\nnow that in those days life was sustained on invincible anguish, as a\nsort of infernal stimulant exciting and consuming at the same time.\n\nIt’s the only period of my life in which I attempted to keep a diary.\nNo, not the only one. Years later, in conditions of moral isolation, I\ndid put down on paper the thoughts and events of a score of days. But\nthis was the first time. I don’t remember how it came about or how the\npocketbook and the pencil came into my hands. It’s inconceivable that I\nshould have looked for them on purpose. I suppose they saved me from the\ncrazy trick of talking to myself.\n\nStrangely enough, in both cases I took to that sort of thing in\ncircumstances in which I did not expect, in colloquial phrase, “to come\nout of it.” Neither could I expect the record to outlast me. This shows\nthat it was purely a personal need for intimate relief and not a call of\negotism.\n\nHere I must give another sample of it, a few detached lines, now\nlooking very ghostly to my own eyes, out of the part scribbled that very\nevening:\n\n*****\n\n“There is something going on in the sky like a decomposition; like a\ncorruption of the air, which remains as still as ever. After all, mere\nclouds, which may or may not hold wind or rain. Strange that it should\ntrouble me so. I feel as if all my sins had found me out. But I suppose\nthe trouble is that the ship is still lying motionless, not under\ncommand; and that I have nothing to do to keep my imagination from\nrunning wild amongst the disastrous images of the worst that may befall\nus. What’s going to happen? Probably nothing. Or anything. It may be a\nfurious squall coming, butt end foremost. And on deck there are five\nmen with the vitality and the strength of, say, two. We may have all our\nsails blown away. Every stitch of canvas has been on her since we broke\nground at the mouth of the Mei-nam, fifteen days ago . . . or fifteen\ncenturies. It seems to me that all my life before that momentous day is\ninfinitely remote, a fading memory of light-hearted youth, something on\nthe other side of a shadow. Yes, sails may very well be blown away.\nAnd that would be like a death sentence on the men. We haven’t strength\nenough on board to bend another suit; incredible thought, but it is\ntrue. Or we may even get dismasted. Ships have been dismasted in squalls\nsimply because they weren’t handled quick enough, and we have no\npower to whirl the yards around. It’s like being bound hand and foot\npreparatory to having one’s throat cut. And what appals me most of all\nis that I shrink from going on deck to face it. It’s due to the ship,\nit’s due to the men who are there on deck--some of them, ready to put\nout the last remnant of their strength at a word from me. And I am\nshrinking from it. From the mere vision. My first command. Now I\nunderstand that strange sense of insecurity in my past. I always\nsuspected that I might be no good. And here is proof positive. I am\nshirking it. I am no good.”\n\n*****\n\nAt that moment, or, perhaps, the moment after, I became aware of Ransome\nstanding in the cabin. Something in his expression startled me. It had a\nmeaning which I could not make out. I exclaimed: “Somebody’s dead.”\n\nIt was his turn then to look startled.\n\n“Dead? Not that I know of, sir. I have been in the forecastle only ten\nminutes ago and there was no dead man there then.”\n\n“You did give me a scare,” I said.\n\nHis voice was extremely pleasant to listen to. He explained that he had\ncome down below to close Mr. Burns’ port in case it should come on to\nrain. “He did not know that I was in the cabin,” he added.\n\n“How does it look outside?” I asked him.\n\n“Very black, indeed, sir. There is something in it for certain.”\n\n“In what quarter?”\n\n“All round, sir.”\n\nI repeated idly: “All round. For certain,” with my elbows on the table.\n\nRansome lingered in the cabin as if he had something to do there, but\nhesitated about doing it. I said suddenly:\n\n“You think I ought to be on deck?”\n\nHe answered at once but without any particular emphasis or accent: “I\ndo, sir.”\n\nI got to my feet briskly, and he made way for me to go out. As I passed\nthrough the lobby I heard Mr. Burns’ voice saying:\n\n“Shut the door of my room, will you, steward?” And Ransome’s rather\nsurprised: “Certainly, sir.”\n\nI thought that all my feelings had been dulled into complete\nindifference. But I found it as trying as ever to be on deck. The\nimpenetrable blackness beset the ship so close that it seemed that\nby thrusting one’s hand over the side one could touch some unearthly\nsubstance. There was in it an effect of inconceivable terror and of\ninexpressible mystery. The few stars overhead shed a dim light upon\nthe ship alone, with no gleams of any kind upon the water, in detached\nshafts piercing an atmosphere which had turned to soot. It was something\nI had never seen before, giving no hint of the direction from which any\nchange would come, the closing in of a menace from all sides.\n\nThere was still no man at the helm. The immobility of all things was\nperfect. If the air had turned black, the sea, for all I knew, might\nhave turned solid. It was no good looking in any direction, watching\nfor any sign, speculating upon the nearness of the moment. When the time\ncame the blackness would overwhelm silently the bit of starlight falling\nupon the ship, and the end of all things would come without a sigh,\nstir, or murmur of any kind, and all our hearts would cease to beat like\nrun-down clocks.\n\nIt was impossible to shake off that sense of finality. The quietness\nthat came over me was like a foretaste of annihilation. It gave me a\nsort of comfort, as though my soul had become suddenly reconciled to an\neternity of blind stillness.\n\nThe seaman’s instinct alone survived whole in my moral dissolution. I\ndescended the ladder to the quarter-deck. The starlight seemed to die\nout before reaching that spot, but when I asked quietly: “Are you there,\nmen?” my eyes made out shadow forms starting up around me, very few,\nvery indistinct; and a voice spoke: “All here, sir.” Another amended\nanxiously:\n\n“All that are any good for anything, sir.”\n\nBoth voices were very quiet and unringing; without any special character\nof readiness or discouragement. Very matter-of-fact voices.\n\n“We must try to haul this mainsail close up,” I said.\n\nThe shadows swayed away from me without a word. Those men were the\nghosts of themselves, and their weight on a rope could be no more than\nthe weight of a bunch of ghosts. Indeed, if ever a sail was hauled up\nby sheer spiritual strength it must have been that sail, for, properly\nspeaking, there was not muscle enough for the task in the whole ship let\nalone the miserable lot of us on deck. Of course, I took the lead in the\nwork myself. They wandered feebly after me from rope to rope, stumbling\nand panting. They toiled like Titans. We were half-an-hour at it at\nleast, and all the time the black universe made no sound. When the last\nleech-line was made fast, my eyes, accustomed to the darkness, made\nout the shapes of exhausted men drooping over the rails, collapsed on\nhatches. One hung over the after-capstan, sobbing for breath, and I\nstood amongst them like a tower of strength, impervious to disease and\nfeeling only the sickness of my soul. I waited for some time fighting\nagainst the weight of my sins, against my sense of unworthiness, and\nthen I said:\n\n“Now, men, we’ll go aft and square the mainyard. That’s about all we can\ndo for the ship; and for the rest she must take her chance.”\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nAs we all went up it occurred to me that there ought to be a man at the\nhelm. I raised my voice not much above a whisper, and, noiselessly, an\nuncomplaining spirit in a fever-wasted body appeared in the light aft,\nthe head with hollow eyes illuminated against the blackness which had\nswallowed up our world--and the universe. The bared forearm extended\nover the upper spokes seemed to shine with a light of its own.\n\nI murmured to that luminous appearance:\n\n“Keep the helm right amidships.”\n\nIt answered in a tone of patient suffering:\n\n“Right amidships, sir.”\n\nThen I descended to the quarter-deck. It was impossible to tell\nwhence the blow would come. To look round the ship was to look into a\nbottomless, black pit. The eye lost itself in inconceivable depths.\n\nI wanted to ascertain whether the ropes had been picked up off the\ndeck. One could only do that by feeling with one’s feet. In my cautious\nprogress I came against a man in whom I recognized Ransome. He possessed\nan unimpaired physical solidity which was manifest to me at the contact.\nHe was leaning against the quarter-deck capstan and kept silent. It was\nlike a revelation. He was the collapsed figure sobbing for breath I had\nnoticed before we went on the poop.\n\n“You have been helping with the mainsail!” I exclaimed in a low tone.\n\n“Yes, sir,” sounded his quiet voice.\n\n“Man! What were you thinking of? You mustn’t do that sort of thing.”\n\nAfter a pause he assented: “I suppose I mustn’t.” Then after another\nshort silence he added: “I am all right now,” quickly, between the\ntell-tale gasps.\n\nI could neither hear nor see anybody else; but when I spoke up,\nanswering sad murmurs filled the quarter-deck, and its shadows seemed to\nshift here and there. I ordered all the halyards laid down on deck clear\nfor running.\n\n“I’ll see to that, sir,” volunteered Ransome in his natural, pleasant\ntone, which comforted one and aroused one’s compassion, too, somehow.\n\nThat man ought to have been in his bed, resting, and my plain duty was\nto send him there. But perhaps he would not have obeyed me; I had not\nthe strength of mind to try. All I said was:\n\n“Go about it quietly, Ransome.”\n\nReturning on the poop I approached Gambril. His face, set with hollow\nshadows in the light, looked awful, finally silenced. I asked him how he\nfelt, but hardly expected an answer. Therefore, I was astonished at his\ncomparative loquacity.\n\n“Them shakes leaves me as weak as a kitten, sir,” he said, preserving\nfinely that air of unconsciousness as to anything but his business a\nhelmsman should never lose. “And before I can pick up my strength that\nthere hot fit comes along and knocks me over again.”\n\nHe sighed. There was no reproach in his tone, but the bare words were\nenough to give me a horrible pang of self-reproach. It held me dumb for\na time. When the tormenting sensation had passed off I asked:\n\n“Do you feel strong enough to prevent the rudder taking charge if she\ngets sternway on her? It wouldn’t do to get something smashed about the\nsteering-gear now. We’ve enough difficulties to cope with as it is.”\n\nHe answered with just a shade of weariness that he was strong enough to\nhang on. He could promise me that she shouldn’t take the wheel out of\nhis hands. More he couldn’t say.\n\nAt that moment Ransome appeared quite close to me, stepping out of the\ndarkness into visibility suddenly, as if just created with his composed\nface and pleasant voice.\n\nEvery rope on deck, he said, was laid down clear for running, as far as\none could make certain by feeling. It was impossible to see anything.\nFrenchy had stationed himself forward. He said he had a jump or two left\nin him yet.\n\nHere a faint smile altered for an instant the clear, firm design\nof Ransome’s lips. With his serious clear, gray eyes, his serene\ntemperament--he was a priceless man altogether. Soul as firm as the\nmuscles of his body.\n\nHe was the only man on board (except me, but I had to preserve my\nliberty of movement) who had a sufficiency of muscular strength to trust\nto. For a moment I thought I had better ask him to take the wheel. But\nthe dreadful knowledge of the enemy he had to carry about him made me\nhesitate. In my ignorance of physiology it occurred to me that he might\ndie suddenly, from excitement, at a critical moment.\n\nWhile this gruesome fear restrained the ready words on the tip of my\ntongue, Ransome stepped back two paces and vanished from my sight.\n\nAt once an uneasiness possessed me, as if some support had been\nwithdrawn. I moved forward, too, outside the circle of light, into\nthe darkness that stood in front of me like a wall. In one stride I\npenetrated it. Such must have been the darkness before creation. It had\nclosed behind me. I knew I was invisible to the man at the helm. Neither\ncould I see anything. He was alone, I was alone, every man was alone\nwhere he stood. And every form was gone too, spar, sail, fittings,\nrails; everything was blotted out in the dreadful smoothness of that\nabsolute night.\n\nA flash of lightning would have been a relief--I mean physically. I\nwould have prayed for it if it hadn’t been for my shrinking apprehension\nof the thunder. In the tension of silence I was suffering from it seemed\nto me that the first crash must turn me into dust.\n\nAnd thunder was, most likely, what would happen next. Stiff all over and\nhardly breathing, I waited with a horribly strained expectation. Nothing\nhappened. It was maddening, but a dull, growing ache in the lower part\nof my face made me aware that I had been grinding my teeth madly enough,\nfor God knows how long.\n\nIt’s extraordinary I should not have heard myself doing it; but I\nhadn’t. By an effort which absorbed all my faculties I managed to keep\nmy jaw still. It required much attention, and while thus engaged I\nbecame bothered by curious, irregular sounds of faint tapping on the\ndeck. They could be heard single, in pairs, in groups. While I wondered\nat this mysterious devilry, I received a slight blow under the left\neye and felt an enormous tear run down my cheek. Raindrops. Enormous.\nForerunners of something. Tap. Tap. Tap. . . .\n\nI turned about, and, addressing Gambrel earnestly, entreated him to\n“hang on to the wheel.” But I could hardly speak from emotion. The\nfatal moment had come. I held my breath. The tapping had stopped\nas unexpectedly as it had begun, and there was a renewed moment of\nintolerable suspense; something like an additional turn of the racking\nscrew. I don’t suppose I would have ever screamed, but I remember my\nconviction that there was nothing else for it but to scream.\n\nSuddenly--how am I to convey it? Well, suddenly the darkness turned into\nwater. This is the only suitable figure. A heavy shower, a downpour,\ncomes along, making a noise. You hear its approach on the sea, in the\nair, too, I verily believe. But this was different. With no preliminary\nwhisper or rustle, without a splash, and even without the ghost\nof impact, I became instantaneously soaked to the skin. Not a very\ndifficult matter, since I was wearing only my sleeping suit. My hair\ngot full of water in an instant, water streamed on my skin, it filled\nmy nose, my ears, my eyes. In a fraction of a second I swallowed quite a\nlot of it.\n\nAs to Gambril, he was fairly choked. He coughed pitifully, the broken\ncough of a sick man; and I beheld him as one sees a fish in an aquarium\nby the light of an electric bulb, an elusive, phosphorescent shape. Only\nhe did not glide away. But something else happened. Both binnaclelamps\nwent out. I suppose the water forced itself into them, though I wouldn’t\nhave thought that possible, for they fitted into the cowl perfectly.\n\nThe last gleam of light in the universe had gone, pursued by a low\nexclamation of dismay from Gambril. I groped for him and seized his arm.\nHow startlingly wasted it was.\n\n“Never mind,” I said. “You don’t want the light. All you need to do\nis to keep the wind, when it comes, at the back of your head. You\nunderstand?”\n\n“Aye, aye, sir. . . . But I should like to have a light,” he added\nnervously.\n\nAll that time the ship lay as steady as a rock. The noise of the water\npouring off the sails and spars, flowing over the break of the poop, had\nstopped short. The poop scuppers gurgled and sobbed for a little\nwhile longer, and then perfect silence, joined to perfect immobility,\nproclaimed the yet unbroken spell of our helplessness, poised on the\nedge of some violent issue, lurking in the dark.\n\nI started forward restlessly. I did not need my sight to pace the poop\nof my ill-starred first command with perfect assurance. Every square\nfoot of her decks was impressed indelibly on my brain, to the very\ngrain and knots of the planks. Yet, all of a sudden, I fell clean over\nsomething, landing full length on my hands and face.\n\nIt was something big and alive. Not a dog--more like a sheep, rather. But\nthere were no animals in the ship. How could an animal. . . . It was an\nadded and fantastic horror which I could not resist. The hair of my\nhead stirred even as I picked myself up, awfully scared; not as a man\nis scared while his judgment, his reason still try to resist, but\ncompletely, boundlessly, and, as it were, innocently scared--like a\nlittle child.\n\nI could see It--that Thing! The darkness, of which so much had just\nturned into water, had thinned down a little. There It was! But I did\nnot hit upon the notion of Mr. Burns issuing out of the companion on all\nfours till he attempted to stand up, and even then the idea of a bear\ncrossed my mind first.\n\nHe growled like one when I seized him round the body. He had buttoned\nhimself up into an enormous winter overcoat of some woolly material, the\nweight of which was too much for his reduced state. I could hardly feel\nthe incredibly thin lath of his body, lost within the thick stuff, but\nhis growl had depth and substance: Confounded dump ship with a craven,\ntiptoeing crowd. Why couldn’t they stamp and go with a brace? Wasn’t\nthere one Godforsaken lubber in the lot fit to raise a yell on a rope?\n\n“Skulking’s no good, sir,” he attacked me directly. “You can’t slink\npast the old murderous ruffian. It isn’t the way. You must go for him\nboldly--as I did. Boldness is what you want. Show him that you don’t\ncare for any of his damned tricks. Kick up a jolly old row.”\n\n“Good God, Mr. Burns,” I said angrily. “What on earth are you up to?\nWhat do you mean by coming up on deck in this state?”\n\n“Just that! Boldness. The only way to scare the old bullying rascal.”\n\nI pushed him, still growling, against the rail. “Hold on to it,” I said\nroughly. I did not know what to do with him. I left him in a hurry, to\ngo to Gambril, who had called faintly that he believed there was some\nwind aloft. Indeed, my own ears had caught a feeble flutter of wet\ncanvas, high up overhead, the jingle of a slack chain sheet. . . .\n\nThese were eerie, disturbing, alarming sounds in the dead stillness\nof the air around me. All the instances I had heard of topmasts being\nwhipped out of a ship while there was not wind enough on her deck to\nblow out a match rushed into my memory.\n\n“I can’t see the upper sails, sir,” declared Gambril shakily.\n\n“Don’t move the helm. You’ll be all right,” I said confidently.\n\nThe poor man’s nerves were gone. Mine were not in much better case.\nIt was the moment of breaking strain and was relieved by the abrupt\nsensation of the ship moving forward as if of herself under my feet.\nI heard plainly the soughing of the wind aloft, the low cracks of\nthe upper spars taking the strain, long before I could feel the least\ndraught on my face turned aft, anxious and sightless like the face of a\nblind man.\n\nSuddenly a louder-sounding note filled our ears, the darkness started\nstreaming against our bodies, chilling them exceedingly. Both of us,\nGambril and I, shivered violently in our clinging, soaked garments of\nthin cotton. I said to him:\n\n“You are all right now, my man. All you’ve got to do is to keep the wind\nat the back of your head. Surely you are up to that. A child could steer\nthis ship in smooth water.”\n\nHe muttered: “Aye! A healthy child.” And I felt ashamed of having been\npassed over by the fever which had been preying on every man’s strength\nbut mine, in order that my remorse might be the more bitter, the feeling\nof unworthiness more poignant, and the sense of responsibility heavier\nto bear.\n\nThe ship had gathered great way on her almost at once on the calm water.\nI felt her slipping through it with no other noise but a mysterious\nrustle alongside. Otherwise, she had no motion at all, neither lift nor\nroll. It was a disheartening steadiness which had lasted for eighteen\ndays now; for never, never had we had wind enough in that time to raise\nthe slightest run of the sea. The breeze freshened suddenly. I thought\nit was high time to get Mr. Burns off the deck. He worried me. I looked\nupon him as a lunatic who would be very likely to start roaming over the\nship and break a limb or fall overboard.\n\nI was truly glad to find he had remained holding on where I had left\nhim, sensibly enough. He was, however, muttering to himself ominously.\n\nThis was discouraging. I remarked in a matter-of-fact tone:\n\n“We have never had so much wind as this since we left the roads.”\n\n“There’s some heart in it, too,” he growled judiciously. It was a remark\nof a perfectly sane seaman. But he added immediately: “It was about time\nI should come on deck. I’ve been nursing my strength for this--just for\nthis. Do you see it, sir?”\n\nI said I did, and proceeded to hint that it would be advisable for him\nto go below now and take a rest.\n\nHis answer was an indignant “Go below! Not if I know it, sir.”\n\nVery cheerful! He was a horrible nuisance. And all at once he started to\nargue. I could feel his crazy excitement in the dark.\n\n“You don’t know how to go about it, sir. How could you? All this\nwhispering and tiptoeing is no good. You can’t hope to slink past a\ncunning, wide-awake, evil brute like he was. You never heard him talk.\nEnough to make your hair stand on end. No! No! He wasn’t mad. He was\nno more mad than I am. He was just downright wicked. Wicked so as to\nfrighten most people. I will tell you what he was. He was nothing\nless than a thief and a murderer at heart. And do you think he’s any\ndifferent now because he’s dead? Not he! His carcass lies a hundred\nfathom under, but he’s just the same . . . in latitude 8 d 20’ north.”\n\nHe snorted defiantly. I noted with weary resignation that the breeze had\ngot lighter while he raved. He was at it again.\n\n“I ought to have thrown the beggar out of the ship over the rail like a\ndog. It was only on account of the men. . . . Fancy having to read the\nBurial Service over a brute like that! . . . ‘Our departed brother’ . . .\nI could have laughed. That was what he couldn’t bear. I suppose I am\nthe only man that ever stood up to laugh at him. When he got sick it\nused to scare that . . . brother. . . . Brother. . . . Departed. . . .\nSooner call a shark brother.”\n\nThe breeze had let go so suddenly that the way of the ship brought the\nwet sails heavily against the mast. The spell of deadly stillness had\ncaught us up again. There seemed to be no escape.\n\n“Hallo!” exclaimed Mr. Burns in a startled voice. “Calm again!”\n\nI addressed him as though he had been sane.\n\n“This is the sort of thing we’ve been having for seventeen days, Mr.\nBurns,” I said with intense bitterness. “A puff, then a calm, and in a\nmoment, you’ll see, she’ll be swinging on her heel with her head away\nfrom her course to the devil somewhere.”\n\nHe caught at the word. “The old dodging Devil,” he screamed piercingly\nand burst into such a loud laugh as I had never heard before. It was a\nprovoking, mocking peal, with a hair-raising, screeching over-note of\ndefiance. I stepped back, utterly confounded.\n\nInstantly there was a stir on the quarter-deck; murmurs of dismay. A\ndistressed voice cried out in the dark below us: “Who’s that gone crazy,\nnow?”\n\nPerhaps they thought it was their captain? Rush is not the word that\ncould be applied to the utmost speed the poor fellows were up to; but\nin an amazing short time every man in the ship able to walk upright had\nfound his way on to that poop.\n\nI shouted to them: “It’s the mate. Lay hold of him a couple of\nyou. . . .”\n\nI expected this performance to end in a ghastly sort of fight. But\nMr. Burns cut his derisive screeching dead short and turned upon them\nfiercely, yelling:\n\n“Aha! Dog-gone ye! You’ve found your tongues--have ye? I thought\nyou were dumb. Well, then--laugh! Laugh--I tell you. Now then--all\ntogether. One, two, three--laugh!”\n\nA moment of silence ensued, of silence so profound that you could have\nheard a pin drop on the deck. Then Ransome’s unperturbed voice uttered\npleasantly the words:\n\n“I think he has fainted, sir--” The little motionless knot of men\nstirred, with low murmurs of relief. “I’ve got him under the arms. Get\nhold of his legs, some one.”\n\nYes. It was a relief. He was silenced for a time--for a time. I could\nnot have stood another peal of that insane screeching. I was sure of it;\nand just then Gambril, the austere Gambril, treated us to another vocal\nperformance. He began to sing out for relief. His voice wailed pitifully\nin the darkness: “Come aft somebody! I can’t stand this. Here she’ll be\noff again directly and I can’t. . . .”\n\nI dashed aft myself meeting on my way a hard gust of wind whose approach\nGambril’s ear had detected from afar and which filled the sails on the\nmain in a series of muffled reports mingled with the low plaint of\nthe spars. I was just in time to seize the wheel while Frenchy who had\nfollowed me caught up the collapsing Gambril. He hauled him out of the\nway, admonished him to lie still where he was, and then stepped up to\nrelieve me, asking calmly:\n\n“How am I to steer her, sir?”\n\n“Dead before it for the present. I’ll get you a light in a moment.”\n\nBut going forward I met Ransome bringing up the spare binnacle lamp.\nThat man noticed everything, attended to everything, shed comfort around\nhim as he moved. As he passed me he remarked in a soothing tone that\nthe stars were coming out. They were. The breeze was sweeping clear the\nsooty sky, breaking through the indolent silence of the sea.\n\nThe barrier of awful stillness which had encompassed us for so many days\nas though we had been accursed, was broken. I felt that. I let myself\nfall on to the skylight seat. A faint white ridge of foam, thin, very\nthin, broke alongside. The first for ages--for ages. I could have\ncheered, if it hadn’t been for the sense of guilt which clung to all my\nthoughts secretly. Ransome stood before me.\n\n“What about the mate,” I asked anxiously. “Still unconscious?”\n\n“Well, sir--it’s funny,” Ransome was evidently puzzled. “He hasn’t\nspoken a word, and his eyes are shut. But it looks to me more like sound\nsleep than anything else.”\n\nI accepted this view as the least troublesome of any, or at any rate,\nleast disturbing. Dead faint or deep slumber, Mr. Burns had to be left\nto himself for the present. Ransome remarked suddenly:\n\n“I believe you want a coat, sir.”\n\n“I believe I do,” I sighed out.\n\nBut I did not move. What I felt I wanted were new limbs. My arms and\nlegs seemed utterly useless, fairly worn out. They didn’t even ache. But\nI stood up all the same to put on the coat when Ransome brought it up.\nAnd when he suggested that he had better now “take Gambril forward,” I\nsaid:\n\n“All right. I’ll help you to get him down on the main deck.”\n\nI found that I was quite able to help, too. We raised Gambril up between\nus. He tried to help himself along like a man but all the time he was\ninquiring piteously:\n\n“You won’t let me go when we come to the ladder? You won’t let me go\nwhen we come to the ladder?”\n\n\nThe breeze kept on freshening and blew true, true to a hair. At daylight\nby careful manipulation of the helm we got the foreyards to run square\nby themselves (the water keeping smooth) and then went about hauling\nthe ropes tight. Of the four men I had with me at night, I could see now\nonly two. I didn’t inquire as to the others. They had given in. For a\ntime only I hoped.\n\nOur various tasks forward occupied us for hours, the two men with me\nmoved so slow and had to rest so often. One of them remarked that “every\nblamed thing in the ship felt about a hundred times heavier than its\nproper weight.” This was the only complaint uttered. I don’t know what\nwe should have done without Ransome. He worked with us, silent, too,\nwith a little smile frozen on his lips. From time to time I murmured to\nhim: “Go steady”--“Take it easy, Ransome”--and received a quick glance\nin reply.\n\nWhen we had done all we could do to make things safe, he disappeared\ninto his galley. Some time afterward, going forward for a look round, I\ncaught sight of him through the open door. He sat upright on the locker\nin front of the stove, with his head leaning back against the bulkhead.\nHis eyes were closed; his capable hands held open the front of his\nthin cotton shirt baring tragically his powerful chest, which heaved in\npainful and laboured gasps. He didn’t hear me.\n\nI retreated quietly and went straight on to the poop to relieve Frenchy,\nwho by that time was beginning to look very sick. He gave me the course\nwith great formality and tried to go off with a jaunty step, but reeled\nwidely twice before getting out of my sight.\n\nAnd then I remained all alone aft, steering my ship, which ran before\nthe wind with a buoyant lift now and then, and even rolling a little.\nPresently Ransome appeared before me with a tray. The sight of food made\nme ravenous all at once. He took the wheel while I sat down of the after\ngrating to eat my breakfast.\n\n“This breeze seems to have done for our crowd,” he murmured. “It just\nlaid them low--all hands.”\n\n“Yes,” I said. “I suppose you and I are the only two fit men in the\nship.”\n\n“Frenchy says there’s still a jump left in him. I don’t know. It can’t\nbe much,” continued Ransome with his wistful smile. “Good little man\nthat. But suppose, sir, that this wind flies round when we are close to\nthe land--what are we going to do with her?”\n\n“If the wind shifts round heavily after we close in with the land she\nwill either run ashore or get dismasted or both. We won’t be able to do\nanything with her. She’s running away with us now. All we can do is to\nsteer her. She’s a ship without a crew.”\n\n“Yes. All laid low,” repeated Ransome quietly. “I do give them a look-in\nforward every now and then, but it’s precious little I can do for them.”\n\n“I, and the ship, and every one on board of her, are very much indebted\nto you, Ransome,” I said warmly.\n\nHe made as though he had not heard me, and steered in silence till I was\nready to relieve him. He surrendered the wheel, picked up the tray, and\nfor a parting shot informed me that Mr. Burns was awake and seemed to\nhave a mind to come up on deck.\n\n“I don’t know how to prevent him, sir. I can’t very well stop down below\nall the time.”\n\nIt was clear that he couldn’t. And sure enough Mr. Burns came on deck\ndragging himself painfully aft in his enormous overcoat. I beheld him\nwith a natural dread. To have him around and raving about the wiles of\na dead man while I had to steer a wildly rushing ship full of dying men\nwas a rather dreadful prospect.\n\nBut his first remarks were quite sensible in meaning and tone.\nApparently he had no recollection of the night scene. And if he had he\ndidn’t betray himself once. Neither did he talk very much. He sat on\nthe skylight looking desperately ill at first, but that strong breeze,\nbefore which the last remnant of my crew had wilted down, seemed to blow\na fresh stock of vigour into his frame with every gust. One could almost\nsee the process.\n\nBy way of sanity test I alluded on purpose to the late captain. I was\ndelighted to find that Mr. Burns did not display undue interest in the\nsubject. He ran over the old tale of that savage ruffian’s iniquities\nwith a certain vindictive gusto and then concluded unexpectedly:\n\n“I do believe, sir, that his brain began to go a year or more before he\ndied.”\n\nA wonderful recovery. I could hardly spare it as much admiration as it\ndeserved, for I had to give all my mind to the steering.\n\nIn comparison with the hopeless languour of the preceding days this was\ndizzy speed. Two ridges of foam streamed from the ship’s bows; the wind\nsang in a strenuous note which under other circumstances would have\nexpressed to me all the joy of life. Whenever the hauled-up mainsail\nstarted trying to slat and bang itself to pieces in its gear, Mr. Burns\nwould look at me apprehensively.\n\n“What would you have me to do, Mr. Burns? We can neither furl it nor set\nit. I only wish the old thing would thrash itself to pieces and be done\nwith it. That beastly racket confuses me.”\n\nMr. Burns wrung his hands, and cried out suddenly:\n\n“How will you get the ship into harbour, sir, without men to handle\nher?”\n\nAnd I couldn’t tell him.\n\nWell--it did get done about forty hours afterward. By the exorcising\nvirtue of Mr. Burns’ awful laugh, the malicious spectre had been laid,\nthe evil spell broken, the curse removed. We were now in the hands of a\nkind and energetic Providence. It was rushing us on. . . .\n\nI shall never forget the last night, dark, windy, and starry. I steered.\nMr. Burns, after having obtained from me a solemn promise to give him\na kick if anything happened, went frankly to sleep on the deck close\nto the binnacle. Convalescents need sleep. Ransome, his back propped\nagainst the mizzen-mast and a blanket over his legs, remained perfectly\nstill, but I don’t suppose he closed his eyes for a moment. That\nembodiment of jauntiness, Frenchy, still under the delusion that there\nwas a “jump” left in him, had insisted on joining us; but mindful of\ndiscipline, had laid himself down as far on the forepart of the poop as\nhe could get, alongside the bucket-rack.\n\nAnd I steered, too tired for anxiety, too tired for connected thought.\nI had moments of grim exultation and then my heart would sink awfully at\nthe thought of that forecastle at the other end of the dark deck, full\nof fever-stricken men--some of them dying. By my fault. But never mind.\nRemorse must wait. I had to steer.\n\nIn the small hours the breeze weakened, then failed altogether. About\nfive it returned, gentle enough, enabling us to head for the roadstead.\nDaybreak found Mr. Burns sitting wedged up with coils of rope on the\nstern-grating, and from the depths of his overcoat steering the ship\nwith very white bony hands; while Ransome and I rushed along the decks\nletting go all the sheets and halliards by the run. We dashed next up on\nto the forecastle head. The perspiration of labour and sheer nervousness\nsimply poured off our heads as we toiled to get the anchors cock-billed.\nI dared not look at Ransome as we worked side by side. We exchanged curt\nwords; I could hear him panting close to me and I avoided turning my\neyes his way for fear of seeing him fall down and expire in the act of\nputting forth his strength--for what? Indeed for some distinct ideal.\n\nThe consummate seaman in him was aroused. He needed no directions. He\nknew what to do. Every effort, every movement was an act of consistent\nheroism. It was not for me to look at a man thus inspired.\n\nAt last all was ready and I heard him say:\n\n“Hadn’t I better go down and open the compressors now, sir?”\n\n“Yes. Do,” I said.\n\nAnd even then I did not glance his way. After a time his voice came up\nfrom the main deck.\n\n“When you like, sir. All clear on the windlass here.”\n\nI made a sign to Mr. Burns to put the helm down and let both anchors go\none after another, leaving the ship to take as much cable as she wanted.\nShe took the best part of them both before she brought up. The loose\nsails coming aback ceased their maddening racket above my head. A\nperfect stillness reigned in the ship. And while I stood forward feeling\na little giddy in that sudden peace, I caught faintly a moan or two and\nthe incoherent mutterings of the sick in the forecastle.\n\nAs we had a signal for medical assistance flying on the mizzen it is a\nfact that before the ship was fairly at rest three steam launches from\nvarious men-of-war were alongside; and at least five naval surgeons had\nclambered on board. They stood in a knot gazing up and down the empty\nmain deck, then looked aloft--where not a man could be seen, either.\n\nI went toward them--a solitary figure, in a blue and gray striped\nsleeping suit and a pipe-clayed cork helmet on its head. Their disgust\nwas extreme. They had expected surgical cases. Each one had brought\nhis carving tools with him. But they soon got over their little\ndisappointment. In less than five minutes one of the steam launches was\nrushing shoreward to order a big boat and some hospital people for the\nremoval of the crew. The big steam pinnace went off to her ship to bring\nover a few bluejackets to furl my sails for me.\n\nOne of the surgeons had remained on board. He came out of the forecastle\nlooking impenetrable, and noticed my inquiring gaze.\n\n“There’s nobody dead in there, if that’s what you want to know,” he said\ndeliberately. Then added in a tone of wonder: “The whole crew!”\n\n“And very bad?”\n\n“And very bad,” he repeated. His eyes were roaming all over the ship.\n“Heavens! What’s that?”\n\n“That,” I said, glancing aft, “is Mr. Burns, my chief officer.”\n\nMr. Burns with his moribund head nodding on the stalk of his lean neck\nwas a sight for any one to exclaim at. The surgeon asked:\n\n“Is he going to the hospital, too?”\n\n“Oh, no,” I said jocosely. “Mr. Burns can’t go on shore till the\nmainmast goes. I am very proud of him. He’s my only convalescent.”\n\n“You look--” began the doctor staring at me. But I interrupted him\nangrily:\n\n“I am not ill.”\n\n“No. . . . You look queer.”\n\n“Well, you see, I have been seventeen days on deck.”\n\n“Seventeen! . . . But you must have slept.”\n\n“I suppose I must have. I don’t know. But I’m certain that I didn’t\nsleep for the last forty hours.”\n\n“Phew! . . . You will be going ashore presently I suppose?”\n\n“As soon as ever I can. There’s no end of business waiting for me\nthere.”\n\nThe surgeon released my hand, which he had taken while we talked, pulled\nout his pocket-book, wrote in it rapidly, tore out the page and offered\nit to me.\n\n“I strongly advise you to get this prescription made up for yourself\nashore. Unless I am much mistaken you will need it this evening.”\n\n“What is it, then?” I asked with suspicion.\n\n“Sleeping draught,” answered the surgeon curtly; and moving with an air\nof interest toward Mr. Burns he engaged him in conversation.\n\nAs I went below to dress to go ashore, Ransome followed me. He begged my\npardon; he wished, too, to be sent ashore and paid off.\n\nI looked at him in surprise. He was waiting for my answer with an air of\nanxiety.\n\n“You don’t mean to leave the ship!” I cried out.\n\n“I do really, sir. I want to go and be quiet somewhere. Anywhere. The\nhospital will do.”\n\n“But, Ransome,” I said. “I hate the idea of parting with you.”\n\n“I must go,” he broke in. “I have a right!” . . . He gasped and a look\nof almost savage determination passed over his face. For an instant he\nwas another being. And I saw under the worth and the comeliness of\nthe man the humble reality of things. Life was a boon to him--this\nprecarious hard life, and he was thoroughly alarmed about himself.\n\n“Of course I shall pay you off if you wish it,” I hastened to say. “Only\nI must ask you to remain on board till this afternoon. I can’t leave Mr.\nBurns absolutely by himself in the ship for hours.”\n\nHe softened at once and assured me with a smile and in his natural\npleasant voice that he understood that very well.\n\nWhen I returned on deck everything was ready for the removal of the\nmen. It was the last ordeal of that episode which had been maturing and\ntempering my character--though I did not know it.\n\nIt was awful. They passed under my eyes one after another--each of them\nan embodied reproach of the bitterest kind, till I felt a sort of revolt\nwake up in me. Poor Frenchy had gone suddenly under. He was carried\npast me insensible, his comic face horribly flushed and as if swollen,\nbreathing stertorously. He looked more like Mr. Punch than ever; a\ndisgracefully intoxicated Mr. Punch.\n\nThe austere Gambril, on the contrary, had improved temporarily.\nHe insisted on walking on his own feet to the rail--of course with\nassistance on each side of him. But he gave way to a sudden panic at the\nmoment of being swung over the side and began to wail pitifully:\n\n“Don’t let them drop me, sir. Don’t let them drop me, sir!” While I kept\non shouting to him in most soothing accents: “All right, Gambril. They\nwon’t! They won’t!”\n\nIt was no doubt very ridiculous. The bluejackets on our deck were\ngrinning quietly, while even Ransome himself (much to the fore in\nlending a hand) had to enlarge his wistful smile for a fleeting moment.\n\nI left for the shore in the steam pinnace, and on looking back beheld\nMr. Burns actually standing up by the taffrail, still in his enormous\nwoolly overcoat. The bright sunlight brought out his weirdness\namazingly. He looked like a frightful and elaborate scarecrow set up on\nthe poop of a death-stricken ship, set up to keep the seabirds from the\ncorpses.\n\nOur story had got about already in town and everybody on shore was most\nkind. The Marine Office let me off the port dues, and as there happened\nto be a shipwrecked crew staying in the Home I had no difficulty in\nobtaining as many men as I wanted. But when I inquired if I could\nsee Captain Ellis for a moment I was told in accents of pity for my\nignorance that our deputy-Neptune had retired and gone home on a\npension about three weeks after I left the port. So I suppose that my\nappointment was the last act, outside the daily routine, of his official\nlife.\n\nIt is strange how on coming ashore I was struck by the springy step,\nthe lively eyes, the strong vitality of every one I met. It impressed me\nenormously. And amongst those I met there was Captain Giles, of course.\nIt would have been very extraordinary if I had not met him. A prolonged\nstroll in the business part of the town was the regular employment of\nall his mornings when he was ashore.\n\nI caught the glitter of the gold watch-chain across his chest ever so\nfar away. He radiated benevolence.\n\n“What is it I hear?” he queried with a “kind uncle” smile, after shaking\nhands. “Twenty-one days from Bangkok?”\n\n“Is this all you’ve heard?” I said. “You must come to tiffin with me. I\nwant you to know exactly what you have let me in for.”\n\nHe hesitated for almost a minute.\n\n“Well--I will,” he said condescendingly at last.\n\nWe turned into the hotel. I found to my surprise that I could eat quite\na lot. Then over the cleared table-cloth I unfolded to Captain Giles\nthe history of these twenty days in all its professional and emotional\naspects, while he smoked patiently the big cigar I had given him.\n\nThen he observed sagely:\n\n“You must feel jolly well tired by this time.”\n\n“No,” I said. “Not tired. But I’ll tell you, Captain Giles, how I feel.\nI feel old. And I must be. All of you on shore look to me just a lot of\nskittish youngsters that have never known a care in the world.”\n\nHe didn’t smile. He looked insufferably exemplary. He declared:\n\n“That will pass. But you do look older--it’s a fact.”\n\n“Aha!” I said.\n\n“No! No! The truth is that one must not make too much of anything in\nlife, good or bad.”\n\n“Live at half-speed,” I murmured perversely. “Not everybody can do\nthat.”\n\n“You’ll be glad enough presently if you can keep going even at that\nrate,” he retorted with his air of conscious virtue. “And there’s\nanother thing: a man should stand up to his bad luck, to his mistakes,\nto his conscience and all that sort of thing. Why--what else would you\nhave to fight against.”\n\nI kept silent. I don’t know what he saw in my face but he asked\nabruptly:\n\n“Why--you aren’t faint-hearted?”\n\n“God only knows, Captain Giles,” was my sincere answer.\n\n“That’s all right,” he said calmly. “You will learn soon how not to be\nfaint-hearted. A man has got to learn everything--and that’s what so\nmany of them youngsters don’t understand.”\n\n“Well, I am no longer a youngster.”\n\n“No,” he conceded. “Are you leaving soon?”\n\n“I am going on board directly,” I said. “I shall pick up one of my\nanchors and heave in to half-cable on the other directly my new crew\ncomes on board and I shall be off at daylight to-morrow!”\n\n“You will,” grunted Captain Giles approvingly, “that’s the way. You’ll\ndo.”\n\n“What did you think? That I would want to take a week ashore for a\nrest?” I said, irritated by his tone. “There’s no rest for me till she’s\nout in the Indian Ocean and not much of it even then.”\n\nHe puffed at his cigar moodily, as if transformed.\n\n“Yes. That’s what it amounts to,” he said in a musing tone. It was as\nif a ponderous curtain had rolled up disclosing an unexpected Captain\nGiles. But it was only for a moment, just the time to let him add,\n“Precious little rest in life for anybody. Better not think of it.”\n\nWe rose, left the hotel, and parted from each other in the street with\na warm handshake, just as he began to interest me for the first time in\nour intercourse.\n\nThe first thing I saw when I got back to the ship was Ransome on the\nquarter-deck sitting quietly on his neatly lashed sea-chest.\n\nI beckoned him to follow me into the saloon where I sat down to write a\nletter of recommendation for him to a man I knew on shore.\n\nWhen finished I pushed it across the table. “It may be of some good to\nyou when you leave the hospital.”\n\nHe took it, put it in his pocket. His eyes were looking away from\nme--nowhere. His face was anxiously set.\n\n“How are you feeling now?” I asked.\n\n“I don’t feel bad now, sir,” he answered stiffly. “But I am afraid of\nits coming on. . . .” The wistful smile came back on his lips for a\nmoment. “I--I am in a blue funk about my heart, sir.”\n\nI approached him with extended hand. His eyes not looking at me had a\nstrained expression. He was like a man listening for a warning call.\n\n“Won’t you shake hands, Ransome?” I said gently.\n\nHe exclaimed, flushed up dusky red, gave my hand a hard wrench--and\nnext moment, left alone in the cabin, I listened to him going up the\ncompanion stairs cautiously, step by step, in mortal fear of starting\ninto sudden anger our common enemy it was his hard fate to carry\nconsciously within his faithful breast."
