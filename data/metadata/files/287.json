THE CITY IN THE WILDERNESS.\n\n\n        “What, are you stepping westward?”  “Yea.”\n             *     *     *     *     *\n         Yet who would stop or fear to advance,\n         Though home or shelter there was none,\n         With such a sky to lead him on!”\n                                 --WORDSWORTH.\n\n        “Ah! cool night wind, tremulous stars,\n            Ah! glimmering water,\n            Fitful earth murmur,\n            Dreaming woods!”\n                                 --ARNOLD.\n\n\nIn A. D. sixteen hundred and ninety-two, a few Franciscan monks began to\nbuild a city. The site chosen was a lovely wilderness hundreds of miles\naway from civilization on every side, and surrounded by savage and\nwarlike tribes. But the spot was as beautiful as the garden of God. It\nwas shielded by picturesque mountains, watered by two rivers, carpeted\nwith flowers innumerable, shaded by noble trees joyful with the notes of\na multitude of singing birds. To breathe the balmy atmosphere was to\nbe conscious of some rarer and finer life, and the beauty of the sunny\nskies--marvellous at dawn and eve with tints of saffron and amethyst and\nopal--was like a dream of heaven.\n\nOne of the rivers was fed by a hundred springs situated in the midst of\ncharming bowers. The monks called it the San Antonio; and on its\nbanks they built three noble Missions. The shining white stone of the\nneighborhood rose in graceful domes and spires above the green trees.\nSculptures, basso-relievos, and lines of gorgeous coloring adorned the\nexteriors. Within, were splendid altars and the appealing charms of\nincense, fine vestures and fine music; while from the belfreys, bells\nsweet and resonant called to the savages, who paused spell-bound and\nhalf-afraid to listen.\n\nCertainly these priests had to fight as well as to pray. The Indians did\nnot suffer them to take possession of their Eden without passionate and\npractical protest. But what the monks had taken, they kept; and the\nfort and the soldier followed the priest and the Cross. Ere long, the\nbeautiful Mission became a beautiful city, about which a sort of fame\nfull of romance and mystery gathered. Throughout the south and west, up\nthe great highway of the Mississippi, on the busy streets of New York,\nand among the silent hills of New England, men spoke of San Antonio,\nas in the seventeenth century they spoke of Peru; as in the eighteenth\ncentury they spoke of Delhi, and Agra, and the Great Mogul.\n\nSanguine French traders carried thither rich ventures in fancy wares\nfrom New Orleans; and Spanish dons from the wealthy cities of Central\nMexico, and from the splendid homes of Chihuahua, came there to buy. And\nfrom the villages of Connecticut, and the woods of Tennessee, and\nthe lagoons of Mississippi, adventurous Americans entered the Texan\nterritory at Nacogdoches. They went through the land, buying horses\nand lending their ready rifles and stout hearts to every effort of\nthat constantly increasing body of Texans, who, even in their swaddling\nbands, had begun to cry Freedom!\n\nAt length this cry became a clamor that shook even the old viceroyal\npalace in Mexico; while in San Antonio it gave a certain pitch to all\nconversation, and made men wear their cloaks, and set their beavers,\nand display their arms, with that demonstrative air of independence they\ncalled los Americano. For, though the Americans were numerically few,\nthey were like the pinch of salt in a pottage--they gave the snap and\nsavor to the whole community.\n\nOver this Franciscan-Moorish city the sun set with an incomparable\nglory one evening in May, eighteen thirty-five. The white, flat-roofed,\nterraced houses--each one in its flowery court--and the domes and spires\nof the Missions, with their gilded crosses, had a mirage-like beauty\nin the rare, soft atmosphere, as if a dream of Old Spain had been\nmaterialized in a wilderness of the New World.\n\nBut human life in all its essentials was in San Antonio, as it was and\nhas been in all other cities since the world began. Women were in their\nhomes, dressing and cooking, nursing their children and dreaming of\ntheir lovers. Men were in the market-places, buying and selling, talking\nof politics and anticipating war. And yet in spite of these fixed\nattributes, San Antonio was a city penetrated with romantic elements,\nand constantly picturesque.\n\nOn this evening, as the hour of the Angelus approached, the narrow\nstreets and the great squares were crowded with a humanity that\nassaulted and captured the senses at once; so vivid and so various were\nits component parts. A tall sinewy American with a rifle across his\nshoulder was paying some money to a Mexican in blue velvet and red\nsilk, whose breast was covered with little silver images of his favorite\nsaints. A party of Mexican officers were strolling to the Alamo; some in\nwhite linen and scarlet sashes, others glittering with color and golden\nornaments. Side by side with these were monks of various orders: the\nFranciscan in his blue gown and large white hat; the Capuchin in his\nbrown serge; the Brother of Mercy in his white flowing robes. Add to\nthese diversities, Indian peons in ancient sandals, women dressed as in\nthe days of Cortez and Pizarro, Mexican vendors of every kind, Jewish\ntraders, negro servants, rancheros curvetting on their horses, Apache\nand Comanche braves on spying expeditions: and, in this various crowd,\nyet by no means of it, small groups of Americans; watchful, silent,\narmed to the teeth: and the mind may catch a glimpse of what the\nstreets of San Antonio were in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and\nthirty-five.\n\nIt was just before sunset that the city was always at its gayest\npoint. Yet, at the first toll of the Angelus, a silence like that of\nenchantment fell upon it. As a mother cries hush to a noisy child, so\nthe angel of the city seemed in this evening bell to bespeak a minute\nfor holy thought. It was only a minute, for with the last note there\nwas even an access of tumult. The doors and windows of the better houses\nwere thrown open, ladies began to appear on the balconies, there was\na sound of laughter and merry greetings, and the tiny cloud of the\ncigarette in every direction.\n\nBut amid this sunset glamour of splendid color, of velvet, and silk,\nand gold embroidery, the man who would have certainly first attracted a\nstranger’s eye wore the plain and ugly costume common at that day to all\nAmerican gentlemen. Only black cloth and white linen and a row palmetto\nhat with a black ribbon around it; but he wore his simple garments\nwith the air of a man having authority, and he returned the continual\nsalutations of rich and poor, like one who had been long familiar with\npublic appreciation.\n\nIt was Dr. Robert Worth, a physician whose fame had penetrated to\nthe utmost boundaries of the territories of New Spain. He had been\ntwenty-seven years in San Antonio. He was a familiar friend in every\nhome. In sickness and in death he had come close to the hearts in them.\nProtected at first by the powerful Urrea family, he had found it easy to\nretain his nationality, and yet live down envy and suspicion. The rich\nhad shown him their gratitude with gold; the poor he had never sent\nunrelieved away, and they had given him their love.\n\nWhen in the second year of his residence he married Dona Maria Flores,\nhe gave, even to doubtful officials, security for his political\nintentions. And his future conduct had seemed to warrant their fullest\nconfidence. In those never ceasing American invasions between eighteen\nhundred and three and eighteen hundred and thirty-two, he had been the\nfriend and succourer of his countrymen, but never their confederate;\ntheir adviser, but never their confidant.\n\nHe was a tall, muscular man of a distinguished appearance. His hair was\nwhite. His face was handsome and good to see. He was laconic in speech,\nbut his eyes were closely observant of all within their range, and they\nasked searching questions. He had a reverent soul, wisely tolerant as\nto creeds, and he loved his country with a passion which absence from\nit constantly intensified. He was believed to be a thoroughly practical\nman, fond of accumulating land and gold; but his daughter Antonia knew\nthat he had in reality a noble imagination. When he spoke to her of the\nwoods, she felt the echoes of the forest ring through the room; when of\nthe sea, its walls melted away in an horizon of long rolling waves.\n\nHe was thinking of Antonia as he walked slowly to his home in the\nsuburbs of the city. Of all his children she was the nearest to him. She\nhad his mother’s beauty. She had also his mother’s upright rectitude\nof nature. The Iberian strain had passed her absolutely by. She was a\nnorthern rose in a tropical garden. As he drew near to his own gates,\nhe involuntarily quickened his steps. He knew that Antonia would be\nwaiting. He could see among the thick flowering shrubs her tall slim\nfigure clothed in white. As she came swiftly down the dim aisles to meet\nhim, he felt a sentiment of worship for her. She concentrated in\nherself his memory of home, mother, and country. She embodied, in the\nperfectness of their mental companionship, that rarest and sweetest\nof ties--a beloved child, who is also a wise friend and a sympathetic\ncomrade. As he entered the garden she slipped her hand into his. He\nclasped it tightly. His smile answered her smile. There was no need for\nany words of salutation.\n\nThe full moon had risen. The white house stood clearly out in its\nradiance. The lattices were wide open and the parlor lighted. They\nwalked slowly towards it, between hedges of white camelias and scarlet\njaponicas. Vanilla, patchuli, verbena, wild wandering honeysuckle--a\nhundred other scents--perfumed the light, warm air. As they came near\nthe house there was a sound of music, soft and tinkling, with a rhythmic\naccent as pulsating as a beating heart.\n\n“It is Don Luis, father.”\n\n“Ah! He plays well--and he looks well.”\n\nThey had advanced to where Don Luis was distinctly visible. He was\nwithin the room, but leaning against the open door, playing upon a\nmandolin. Robert Worth smiled as he offered his hand to him. It was\nimpossible not to smile at a youth so handsome, and so charming--a\nyouth who had all the romance of the past in his name, his home,\nhis picturesque costume; and all the enchantments of hope and great\nenthusiasms in his future.\n\n“Luis, I am glad to see you; and I felt your music as soon as I heard\nit.”\n\nHe was glancing inquiringly around the room as he spoke; and Antonia\nanswered the look:\n\n“Mother and Isabel are supping with Dona Valdez. There is to be a dance.\nI am waiting for you, father. You must put on your velvet vest.”\n\n“And you, Luis?”\n\n“I do not go. I asked the judge for the appointment. He refused me. Very\nwell! I care not to drink chocolate and dance in his house. One hand\nwashes the other, and one cousin should help another.”\n\n“Why did he refuse you?”\n\n“Who can tell?” but Luis shrugged his shoulders expressively, and added,\n“He gave the office to Blas-Sangre.”\n\n“Ah!”\n\n“Yes, it is so--naturally;--Blas-Sangre is rich, and when the devil\nof money condescends to appear, every little devil rises up to do him\nhomage.”\n\n“Let it pass, Luis. Suppose you sing me that last verse again. It had a\ntaking charm. The music was like a boat rocking on the water.”\n\n“So it ought to be. I learned the words in New Orleans. The music came\nfrom the heart of my mandolin. Listen, Senor!\n\n        “‘Row young oarsman, row, young oarsman,\n            Into the crypt of the night we float:\n          Fair, faint moonbeams wash and wander,\n            Wash and wander about the boat.\n          Not a fetter is here to bind us,\n            Love and memory lose their spell;\n          Friends that we have left behind us,\n            Prisoners of content,--farewell!’”\n\n“You are a wizard, Luis, and I have had a sail with you. Now, come with\nus, and show those dandy soldiers from the Alamo how to dance.”\n\n“Pardon! I have not yet ceased to cross myself at the affront of this\nmorning. And the Senora Valdez is in the same mind as her husband. I\nshould be received by her like a dog at mass. I am going to-morrow to\nthe American colony on the Colorado.”\n\n“Be careful, Luis. These Austin colonists are giving great\ntrouble--there have been whispers of very strong measures. I speak as a\nfriend.”\n\n“My heart to yours! But let me tell you this about the Americans--their\ndrum is in the hands of one who knows how to beat it.”\n\n“As a matter of hearsay, are you aware that three detachments of troops\nare on their way from Mexico?”\n\n“For Texas?”\n\n“For Texas.”\n\n“What are three detachments? Can a few thousand men put Texas under lock\nand key? I assure you not, Senor; but now I must say adieu!”\n\nHe took the doctor’s hand, and, as he held it, turned his luminous face\nand splendid eyes upon Antonia. A sympathetic smile brightened her own\nface like a flame. Then he went silently away, and Antonia watched him\ndisappear among the shrubbery.\n\n“Come, Antonia! I am ready. We must not keep the Senora waiting too\nlong.”\n\n“I am ready also, father.” Her voice was almost sad, and yet it had a\ntone of annoyance in it--“Don Luis is so imprudent,” she said. “He is\nalways in trouble. He is full of enthusiasms; he is as impossible as his\nfavorite, Don Quixote.”\n\n“And I thank God, Antonia, that I can yet feel with him. Woe to the\ncenturies without Quixotes! Nothing will remain to them but--Sancho\nPanzas.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. ANTONIA AND ISABEL.\n\n        “He various changes of the world had known,\n         And some vicissitudes of human fate,\n         Still altering, never in a steady state\n         Good after ill, and after pain delight,\n         Alternate, like the scenes of day and night.”\n\n                “Ladies whose bright eyes\n         Rain influence.”\n\n        “But who the limits of that power shall trace,\n         Which a brave people into life can bring,\n         Or hide at will, for freedom combating\n         By just revenge inflamed?”\n\n\nFor many years there had never been any doubt in the mind of Robert\nWorth as to the ultimate destiny of Texas, though he was by no means\nan adventurer, and had come into the beautiful land by a sequence of\nnatural and business-like events. He was born in New York. In that city\nhe studied his profession, and in eighteen hundred and three began its\npractice in an office near Contoit’s Hotel, opposite the City Park. One\nday he was summoned there to attend a sick man. His patient proved to\nbe Don Jaime Urrea, and the rich Mexican grandee conceived a warm\nfriendship for the young physician.\n\nAt that very time, France had just ceded to the United States the\nterritory of Louisiana, and its western boundary was a subject about\nwhich Americans were then angrily disputing. They asserted that it was\nthe Rio Grande; but Spain, who naturally did not want Americans so\nnear her own territory, denied the claim, and made the Sabine River\nthe dividing line. And as Spain had been the original possessor of\nLouisiana, she considered herself authority on the subject.\n\nThe question was on every tongue, and it was but natural that it\nshould be discussed by Urrea and his physician. In fact, they talked\ncontinually of the disputed boundary, and of Mexico. And Mexico was then\na name to conjure by. She was as yet a part of Spain, and a sharer in\nall her ancient glories. She was a land of romance, and her very name\ntasted on the lips, of gold, and of silver, and of precious stones.\nUrrea easily persuaded the young man to return to Mexico with him.\n\nThe following year there was a suspicious number of American visitors\nand traders in San Antonio, and one of the Urreas was sent with a\nconsiderable number of troops to garrison the city. For Spain was well\naware that, however statesmen might settle the question, the young\nand adventurous of the American people considered Texas United States\nterritory, and would be well inclined to take possession of it by force\nof arms, if an opportunity offered.\n\nRobert Worth accompanied General Urrea to San Antonio, and the visit\nwas decisive as to his future life. The country enchanted him. He was\nsmitten with love for it, as men are smitten with a beautiful face.\nAnd the white Moorish city had one special charm for him--it was seldom\nquite free from Americans, Among the mediaeval loungers in the narrow\nstreets, it filled his heart with joy to see at intervals two or three\nbig men in buckskin or homespun. And he did not much wonder that the\nMorisco-Hispano-Mexican feared these Anglo-Americans, and suspected them\nof an intention to add Texan to their names.\n\nHis inclination to remain in San Antonio was settled by his marriage.\nDona Maria Flores, though connected with the great Mexican families of\nYturbide and Landesa, owned much property in San Antonio. She had been\nborn within its limits, and educated in its convent, and a visit to\nMexico and New Orleans had only strengthened her attachment to her own\ncity. She was a very pretty woman, with an affectionate nature, but she\nwas not intellectual. Even in the convent the sisters had not considered\nher clever.\n\nBut men often live very happily with commonplace wives, and Robert Worth\nhad never regretted that his Maria did not play on the piano, and paint\non velvet, and work fine embroideries for the altars. They had passed\nnearly twenty-six years together in more than ordinary content and\nprosperity. Yet no life is without cares and contentions, and Robert\nWorth had had to face circumstances several times, which had brought the\nreal man to the front.\n\nThe education of his children had been such a crisis. He had two sons\nand two daughters, and for them he anticipated a wider and grander\ncareer than he had chosen for himself. When his eldest child, Thomas,\nhad reached the age of fourteen, he determined to send him to New York.\nHe spoke to Dona Maria of this intention. He described Columbia to her\nwith all the affectionate pride of a student for his alma mater. The\nboy’s grandmother also still lived in the home wherein, he himself had\ngrown to manhood. His eyes filled with tears when he remembered the red\nbrick house in Canal Street, with its white door and dormer windows, and\nits one cherry tree in the strip of garden behind.\n\nBut Dona Maria’s national and religious principles, or rather\nprejudices, were very strong. She regarded the college of San Juan de\nLateran in Mexico as the fountainhead of knowledge. Her confessor had\ntold her so. All the Yturbides and Landesas had graduated at San Juan.\n\nBut the resolute father would have none of San Juan. “I know all about\nit, Maria,” he said. “They will teach Thomas Latin very thoroughly. They\nwill make him proficient in theology and metaphysics. They will let him\ndabble in algebra and Spanish literature; and with great pomp, they will\ngive him his degree, and ‘the power of interpreting Aristotle all over\nthe world.’ What kind of an education is that, for a man who may have to\nfight the battles of life in this century?”\n\nAnd since the father carried his point it is immaterial what precise\nmethods he used. Men are not fools even in a contest with women. They\nusually get their own way, if they take the trouble to go wisely and\nkindly about it. Two years afterwards, Antonia followed her brother to\nNew York, and this time, the mother made less opposition. Perhaps she\ndivined that opposition would have been still more useless than in the\ncase of the boy. For Robert Worth had one invincible determination; it\nwas, that this beautiful child, who so much resembled a mother whom\nhe idolized, should be, during the most susceptible years of her life,\nunder that mother’s influence.\n\nAnd he was well repaid for the self-denial her absence entailed,\nwhen Antonia came back to him, alert, self-reliant, industrious, an\nintelligent and responsive companion, a neat and capable housekeeper,\nwho insensibly gave to his home that American air it lacked, and who set\nupon his table the well-cooked meats and delicate dishes which he had\noften longed for.\n\nJohn, the youngest boy, was still in New York finishing his course of\nstudy; but regarding Isabel, there seemed to be a tacit relinquishment\nof the purpose, so inflexibly carried out with her brothers and sister.\nIsabel was entirely different from them. Her father had watched her\ncarefully, and come to the conviction that it would be impossible to\nmake her nature take the American mintage. She was as distinctly Iberian\nas Antonia was Anglo-American.\n\nIn her brothers the admixture of races had been only as alloy to metal.\nThomas Worth was but a darker copy of his father. John had the romance\nand sensitive honor of old Spain, mingled with the love of liberty, and\nthe practical temper, of those Worths who had defied both Charles the\nFirst and George the Third. But Isabel had no soul-kinship with her\nfather’s people. Robert Worth had seen in the Yturbide residencia\nin Mexico the family portraits which they had brought with them from\nCastile. Isabel was the Yturbide of her day. She had all their physical\ntraits, and from her large golden-black eyes the same passionate soul\nlooked forth. He felt that it would be utter cruelty to send her among\npeople who must always be strangers to her.\n\nSo Isabel dreamed away her childhood at her mother’s side, or with\nthe sisters in the convent, learning from them such simple and useless\nmatters as they considered necessary for a damosel of family and\nfortune. On the night of the Senora Valdez’s reception, she had\nastonished every one by the adorable grace of her dancing, and the\ncaptivating way in which she used her fan. Her fingers touched the\nguitar as if they had played it for a thousand years. She sang a Spanish\nRomancero of El mio Cid with all the fire and tenderness of a Castilian\nmaid.\n\nHer father watched her with troubled eyes. He almost felt as if he had\nno part in her. And the thought gave him an unusual anxiety, for he\nknew this night that the days were fast approaching which would test to\nextremity the affection which bound his family together. He contrived to\ndraw Antonia aside for a few moments.\n\n“Is she not wonderful?” he asked. “When did she learn these things? I\nmean the way in which she does them?”\n\nIsabel was dancing La Cachoucha, and Antonia looked at her little sister\nwith eyes full of loving speculation. Her answer dropped slowly from her\nlips, as if a conviction was reluctantly expressed:\n\n“The way must be a gift from the past--her soul has been at school\nbefore she was born here. Father, are you troubled? What is it? Not\nIsabel, surely?”\n\n“Not Isabel, primarily. Antonia, I have been expecting something for\ntwenty years. It is coming.”\n\n“And you are sorry?”\n\n“I am anxious, that is all. Go back to the dancers. In the morning we\ncan talk.”\n\nIn the morning the doctor was called very early by some one needing his\nskill. Antonia heard the swift footsteps and eager voices, and watched\nhim mount the horse always kept ready saddled for such emergencies, and\nride away with the messenger. The incident in itself was a usual\none, but she was conscious that her soul was moving uneasily and\nquestioningly in some new and uncertain atmosphere.\n\nShe had felt it on her first entrance into Senora Valdez’s gran sala--a\nsomething irrepressible in the faces of all the men present. She\nremembered that even the servants had been excited, and that they\nstood in small groups, talking with suppressed passion and with much\ndemonstrativeness. And the officers from the Alamo! How conscious they\nhad been of their own importance! What airs of condescension and of an\nalmost insufferable protection they had assumed! Now, that she recalled\nthe faces of Judge Valdez, and other men of years and position, she\nunderstood that there had been in them something out of tone with the\noccasion. In the atmosphere of the festa she had only felt it. In the\nsolitude of her room she could apprehend its nature.\n\nFor she had been born during those stormy days when Magee and Bernardo,\nwith twelve hundred Americans, first flung the banner of Texan\nindependence to the wind; when the fall of Nacogdoches sent a thrill of\nsympathy through the United States, and enabled Cos and Toledo, and the\nother revolutionary generals in Mexico, to carry their arms against Old\nSpain to the very doors of the vice-royal palace. She had heard from\nher father many a time the whole brave, brilliant story--the same story\nwhich has been made in all ages from the beginning of time. Only\nthe week before, they had talked it over as they sat under the great\nfig-tree together.\n\n“History but repeats itself,” the doctor had said then; “for when\nthe Mexicans drove the Spaniards, with their court ceremonies, their\nmonopolies and taxes, back to Spain, they were just doing what the\nAmerican colonists did, when they drove the English royalists back\nto England. It was natural, too, that the Americans should help the\nMexicans, for, at first, they were but a little band of patriots; and\nthe American-Saxon has like the Anglo-Saxon an irresistible impulse to\nhelp the weaker side. And oh, Antonia! The cry of Freedom! Who that has\na soul can resist it?”\n\nShe remembered this conversation as she stood in the pallid dawning, and\nwatched her father ride swiftly away. The story of the long struggle in\nall its salient features flashed through her mind; and she understood\nthat it is not the sword alone that gives liberty--that there must be\npatience before courage; that great ideas must germinate for years in\nthe hearts of men before the sword can reap the harvest.\n\nThe fascinating memory of Burr passed like a shadow across her dreaming.\nThe handsome Lafayettes--the gallant Nolans--the daring Hunters--the\nthousands of forgotten American traders and explorers--bold and\nenterprising--they had sown the seed. For great ideas are as catching as\nevil ones. A Mexican, with the iron hand of Old Spain upon him and the\nshadow of the Inquisition over him, could not look into the face of an\nAmerican, and not feel the thought of Freedom stirring in his heart.\n\nIt stirred in her own heart. She stood still a moment to feel\nconsciously the glow and the enlargement. Then with an impulse natural,\nbut neither analyzed nor understood, she lifted her prayer-book, and\nbegan to recite “the rising prayer.” She had not said to herself, “from\nthe love of Freedom to the love of God, it is but a step,” but she\nexperienced the emotion and felt all the joy of an adoration, simple and\nunquestioned, springing as naturally from the soul as the wild flower\nfrom the prairie.\n\nAs she knelt, up rose the sun, and flooded her white figure and her fair\nunbound hair with the radiance of the early morning. The matin bells\nchimed from the convent and the churches, and the singing birds began to\nflutter their bright wings, and praise God also, “in their Latin.”\n\nShe took her breakfast alone. The Senora never came downstairs so\nearly. Isabel had wavering inclinations, and generally followed them.\nSometimes, even her father had his cup of strong coffee alone in his\nstudy; so the first meal of the day was usually, as perhaps it ought\nto be, a selfishly-silent one. “Too much enthusiasm and chattering at\nbreakfast, are like too much red at sunrise,” the doctor always said;\n“a dull, bad day follows it”--and Antonia’s observation had turned the\nlittle maxim into a superstition.\n\nIn the Senora’s room, the precept was either denied, or defied. Antonia\nheard the laughter and conversation through the closed door, and easily\ndivined the subject of it. It was, but natural. The child had a triumph;\none that appealed strongly to her mother’s pride and predilections.\nIt was a pleasant sight to see them in the shaded sunshine exulting\nthemselves happily in it.\n\nThe Senora, plump and still pretty, reclined upon a large gilded bed.\nIts splendid silk coverlet and pillows cased in embroidery and lace made\nan effective background for her. She leaned with a luxurious indolence\namong them, sipping chocolate and smoking a cigarrito. Isabel was on a\ncouch of the same description. She wore a satin petticoat, and a loose\nlinen waist richly trimmed with lace. It showed her beautiful shoulders\nand arms to perfection. Her hands were folded above her head. Her tiny\nfeet, shod in satin, were quivering like a bird’s wings, as if they were\nkeeping time with the restlessness of her spirit.\n\nShe had large eyes, dark and bright; strong eyebrows, a pale complexion\nwith a flood of brilliant color in the checks, dazzling even teeth,\nand a small, handsome mouth. Her black hair was loose and flowing, and\ncaressed her cheeks and temples in numberless little curls and tendrils.\nHer face was one flush of joy and youth. She had a look half-earnest and\nhalf-childlike, and altogether charming. Antonia adored her, and she\nwas pleased to listen to the child, telling over again the pretty things\nthat had been said to her.\n\n“Only Don Luis was not there at all, Antonia. There is always something\nwanting,” and her voice fell with those sad inflections that are often\nonly the very excess of delight.\n\nThe Senora looked sharply at her. “Don Luis was not desirable. He was\nbetter away--much better!”\n\n“But why?”\n\n“Because, Antonia, he is suspected. There is an American called Houston.\nDon Luis met him in Nacogdoches. He has given his soul to him, I think.\nHe would have fought Morello about him, if the captain could have drawn\nhis sword in such a quarrel. I should not have known about the affair\nhad not Senora Valdez told me. Your father says nothing against the\nAmericans.”\n\n“Perhaps, then, he knows nothing against them.”\n\n“You will excuse me, Antonia; not only the living but the dead must have\nheard of their wickedness. They are a nation of ingrates. Ingrates are\ncowards. It was these words Captain Morello said, when Don Luis drew his\nsword, made a circle with its point and stood it upright in the centre.\nIt was a challenge to the whole garrigon, and about this fellow Houston,\nwhom he calls his friend! Holy Virgin preserve us from such Mexicans!”\n\n“It is easier to talk than to fight. Morello’s tongue is sharper than\nhis sword.”\n\n“Captain Morello was placing his sword beside that of Don Luis, when the\nCommandant interfered. He would not permit his officers to fight in such\na quarrel. ‘Santo Dios!’ he said, ‘you shall all have your opportunity\nvery soon, gentlemen.’ Just reflect upon the folly of a boy like Don\nLuis, challenging a soldier like Morello!”\n\n“He was in no danger, mother,” said Antonia scornfully. “Morello is a\nbully, who wears the pavement out with his spurs and sabre. His weapons\nare for show. Americans, at least, wear their arms for use, and not for\nornament.”\n\n“Listen, Antonia! I will not have them spoken of. They are Jews--or at\nleast infidels, all of them!--the devil himself is their father--the\nbishop, when he was here last confirmation, told me so.”\n\n“Mother!”\n\n“At least they are unbaptized Christians, Antonia. If you are not\nbaptized, the devil sends you to do his work. As for Don Luis, he is a\nvery Judas! Ah, Maria Santissima! how I do pity his good mother!”\n\n“Poor Don Luis!” said Isabel plaintively.\n\n“He is so handsome, and he sings like a very angel. And he loves my\nfather; he wanted to be a doctor, so that he could always be with him.\nI dare say this man called Houston is no better than a Jew, and perhaps\nvery ugly beside. Let us talk no more about him and the Americans. I\nam weary of them; as Tia Rachella says, ‘they have their spoon in every\none’s mess.’”\n\nAnd Antonia, whose heart was burning, only stooped down and closed her\nsister’s pretty mouth with a kiss. Her tongue was impatient to speak for\nthe father, and grandmother, and the friends, so dear to her; but she\npossessed great discretion, and also a large share of that rarest of all\nwomanly graces, the power under provocation, of “putting on Patience the\nnoble.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. BUILDERS OF THE COMMONWEALTH.\n\n\n     “Methinks I see in my mind a noble and puissant nation rousing\n     herself like a strong man after sleep and shaking her\n     invincible locks.  Methinks I see her as an eagle mewing her\n     mighty youth and kindling her undazzled eye in the full mid-day beam.”\n      --MILTON.\n\n     “And from these grounds, concluding as we doe,\n      Warres causes diuerse, so by consequence\n     Diuerse we must conclude their natures too:\n      For war proceeding from Omnipotence,\n     No doubt is holy, wise, and without error;\n      The sword, of justice and of sin, the terror.”\n                              --LORD BROOKE.\n\nIt is the fashion now to live for the present but the men of fifty\nyears ago, the men who builded the nation, they reverenced the past, and\ntherefore they could work for the future. As Robert Worth rode through\nthe streets of San Antonio that afternoon, he was thinking, not of his\nown life, but of his children’s and of the generations which should come\nafter them.\n\nThe city was flooded with sunshine, and crowded with a pack-train going\nto Sonora; the animals restlessly protesting against the heat and flies;\ntheir Mexican drivers in the pulqueria, spending their last peso with\ntheir compadres, or with the escort of soldiers which was to accompany\nthem--a little squad of small, lithe men, with round, yellow, beardless\nfaces, bearing in a singular degree the stamp of being native to\nthe soil. Their lieutenant, a gorgeously clad officer with a very\ndistinguished air, was coming slowly down the street to join them. He\nbowed, and smiled pleasantly to the doctor as he passed him, and then\nin a few moments the word of command and the shouting of men and the\nclatter of hoofs invaded the enchanted atmosphere like an insult.\n\nBut the tumult scarcely jarred with the thoughts of his mind. They\nhad been altogether of war and rumors of war. Every hour that subtile\nconsciousness of coming events, which makes whole communities at\ntimes prescient, was becoming stronger. “If the powers of the air have\nanything to do with the destinies of men,” he muttered, “there must be\nunseen battalions around me. The air I am breathing is charged with the\nfeeling of battle.”\n\nAfter leaving the city there were only a few Mexican huts on the shady\nroad leading to his own house. All within them were asleep, even\nthe fighting cocks tied outside were dozing on their perches. He was\nunusually weary, he had been riding since dawn, and his heart had\nnot been in sympathy with his body, it had said no good cheer to it,\nwhispered no word of courage or promise.\n\nAll at once his physical endurance seemed exhausted, and he saw the\nwhite wall and arched gateway of his garden and the turrets of his home\nwith an inexpressible relief. But it was the hour of siesta, and he was\nalways careful not to let the requirements of his profession disturb his\nhousehold. So he rode quietly to the rear, where he found a peon nodding\nwithin the stable door. He opened his eyes unnaturally wide, and rose to\nserve his master.\n\n“See thou rub the mare well down, and give her corn and water.”\n\n“To be sure, Senior, that is to be done. A stranger has been here\nto-day; an American.”\n\n“What did he say to thee?”\n\n“That he would call again, Senor.”\n\nThe incident was not an unusual one, and it did not trouble the doctor’s\nmind. There was on the side of the house a low extension containing two\nrooms. These rooms belonged exclusively to him. One was his study, his\noffice, his covert, the place to which he went when he wanted to be\nalone with his own soul. There were a bed and bath and refreshments in\nthe other room. He went directly to it, and after eating and washing,\nfell into a profound sleep.\n\nAt the hour before Angelus the house was as noisy and busy as if it had\nbeen an inn. The servants were running hither and thither, all of them\nexpressing themselves in voluble Spanish. The cooks were quarrelling in\nthe kitchen. Antonia was showing the table men, as she had to do afresh\nevery day, how to lay the cloth and serve the dishes in the American\nfashion. When the duty was completed, she went into the garden to listen\nfor the Angelus. The young ladies of to-day would doubtless consider her\ntoilet frightfully unbecoming; but Antonia looked lovely in it, though\nbut a white muslin frock, with a straight skirt and low waist and short,\nfull sleeves. It was confined by a blue belt with a gold buckle, and her\nfeet were in sandalled slippers of black satin.\n\nThe Angelus tolled, and the thousands of Hail Maries! which blended with\nits swinging vibrations were uttered, and left to their fate, as all\nspoken words must be. Antonia still observed the form. It lent for a\nmoment a solemn beauty to her face. She was about to re-enter the house,\nwhen she saw a stranger approaching it. He was dressed in a handsome\nbuckskin suit, and a wide Mexican hat, but she knew at once that he was\nan American, and she waited to receive him.\n\nAs soon as he saw her, he removed his hat and approached with it in\nhis hand. Perhaps he was conscious that the act not only did homage to\nwomanhood, but revealed more perfectly a face of remarkable beauty and\nnobility. For the rest, he was very tall, powerfully built, elegantly\nproportioned, and his address had the grace and polish of a cultured\ngentleman.\n\n“I wish to see Dr. Worth, Dona.”\n\nWith a gentle inclination of the head, she led him to the door of her\nfather’s office. She was the only one in the Doctor’s family at all\nfamiliar with the room. The Senora said so many books made her feel as\nif she were in a church or monastery; she was afraid to say anything\nbut paternosters in it. Isabel cowered before the poor skeleton in the\ncorner, and the centipedes and snakes that filled the bottles on the\nshelves. There was not a servant that would enter the room.\n\nBut Antonia did not regard books as a part of some vague spiritual\npower. She knew the history of the skeleton. She had seen the death of\nmany of those “little devils” corked up in alcohol. She knew that at\nthis hour, if her father were at home he was always disengaged, and she\nopened the door fearlessly, saying, “Father, here is a gentleman who\nwishes to see you.”\n\nThe doctor had quite refreshed himself, and, in a house-suit of clean,\nwhite linen, was lying on a couch reading. He arose with alacrity, and\nwith his pleasant smile seemed to welcome the intruder, as he stepped\nbehind him and closed the door. Antonia had disappeared. They were quite\nalone.\n\n“You are Doctor Robert Worth, sir?”\n\nTheir eyes met, their souls knew each other.\n\n“And you are Sam Houston?”\n\nThe questions were answered in a hand grip, a sympathetic smile on both\nfaces--the freemasonry of kindred spirits.\n\n“I have a letter from your son Thomas, doctor, and I think, also, that\nyou will have something to say to me, and I to you.”\n\nThe most prudent of patriots could not have resisted this man. He had\nthat true imperial look which all born rulers of men possess--that look\nthat half coerces, and wholly persuades. Robert Worth acknowledged its\npower by his instant and decisive answer.\n\n“I have, indeed, much to say to you. We shall have dinner directly, then\nyou will give the night to me?”\n\nAfter a short conversation he led him into the sala and introduced him\nto Antonia. He himself had to prepare the Senora for her visitor, and\nhe had a little quaking of the heart as he entered her room. She was\ndressed for dinner, and turned with a laughing face to meet him.\n\n“I have been listening to the cooks quarrelling over the olla, Roberto.\nBut what can my poor Manuel say when your Irishwoman attacks him. Listen\nto her! ‘Take your dirty stew aff the fire then! Shure it isn’t fit for\na Christian to ate at all!’”\n\n“I hope it is, Maria, for we have a visitor to-night.”\n\n“Who, then, my love?”\n\n“Mr. Houston.”\n\n“Sam Houston? Holy Virgin of Guadalupe preserve us! I will not see the\nman.”\n\n“I think you will, Maria. He has brought this letter for you from our\nson Thomas; and he has been so kind as to take charge of some fine\nhorses, and sell them well for him in San Antonio. When a man does us a\nkindness, we should say thank you.”\n\n“That is truth, if the man is not the Evil One. As for this Sam Houston,\nyou should have heard what was said of him at the Valdez’s.”\n\n“I did hear. Everything was a lie.”\n\n“But he is a very common man.”\n\n“Maria, do you call a soldier, a lawyer, a member of the United States\nCongress, a governor of a great State like Tennessee, a common man?\nHouston has been all of these things.”\n\n“It is, however, true that he has lived with Indians, and with those\nAmericans, who are bad, who have no God, who are infidels, and perhaps\neven cannibals. If he is a good man, why does he live with bad men? Not\neven the saints could do that. A good man should be in his home. Why\ndoes he not stay at home.”\n\n“Alas! Maria, that is a woman’s fault. He loved a beautiful girl. He\nmarried her. My dear one, she did not bless his life as you have blessed\nmine. No one knows what his sorrow was, for he told no one. And he never\nblamed her, only he left his high office and turned his back forever on\nhis home.”\n\n“Ah! the cruel woman. Holy Virgin, what hard hearts thou hast to pray\nfor!”\n\n“Come down and smile upon him, Maria. I should like him to see a\nhigh-born Mexican lady. Are they not the kindest and fairest among all\nGod’s women? I know, at least, Maria, that you are kind and fair”; and\nhe took her hands, and drew her within his embrace.\n\nWhat good wife can resist her husband’s wooing? Maria did not. She\nlifted her face, her eyes shone through happy tears, she whispered\nsoftly: “My Robert, it is a joy to please you. I will be kind; I will\nbe grateful about Thomas. You shall see that I will make a pleasant\nevening.”\n\nSo the triumphant husband went down, proud and happy, with his smiling\nwife upon his arm. Isabel was already in the room. She also wore a white\nfrock, but her hair was pinned back with gold butterflies, and she had\na beautiful golden necklace around her throat. And the Senora kept\nher word. She paid her guest great attention. She talked to him of his\nadventures with the Indians. She requested her daughters to sing to him.\nShe told him stories of the old Castilian families with which she was\nconnected, and described her visit to New Orleans with a great deal of\npleasant humor. She felt that she was doing herself justice; that she\nwas charming; and, consequently, she also was charmed with the guest and\nthe occasion which had been so favorable to her.\n\nAfter the ladies had retired, the doctor led his visitor into his study.\nHe sat down silently and placed a chair for Houston. Both men hesitated\nfor a moment to open the conversation. Worth, because he was treading\non unknown ground; Houston, because he did not wish to force, even by a\nquestion, a resolution which he felt sure would come voluntarily.\n\nThe jar of tobacco stood between them, and they filled their pipes\nsilently. Then Worth laid a letter upon the table, and said: “I\nunstand{sic} from this, that my son Thomas thinks the time has come for\ndecisive action.”\n\n“Thomas Worth is right. With such souls as his the foundation of the\nstate must be laid.”\n\n“I am glad Thomas has taken the position he has; but you must remember,\nsir, that he is unmarried and unembarrassed by many circumstances which\nrender decisive movement on my part a much more difficult thing. Yet no\nman now living has watched the Americanizing of Texas with the interest\nthat I have.”\n\n“You have been long on the watch, sir.”\n\n“I was here when my countrymen came first, in little companies of five\nor ten men. I saw the party of twenty, who joined the priest Hidalgo in\neighteen hundred and ten, when Mexico made her first attempt to throw\noff the Spanish yoke.”\n\n“An unsuccessful attempt.”\n\n“Yes. The next year I made a pretended professional journey to\nChihuahua, to try and save their lives. I failed. They were shot with\nHidalgo there.”\n\n“Yet the strife for liberty went on.”\n\n“It did. Two years afterwards, Magee and Bernardo, with twelve hundred\nAmericans, raised the standard of independence on the Trinity River. I\nsaw them them{sic} take this very city, though it was ably defended by\nSalcedo. They fought like heroes. I had many of the wounded in my house.\nI succored them with my purse.\n\n“It was a great deed for a handful of men.”\n\n“The fame of it brought young Americans by hundreds here. To a man they\njoined the Mexican party struggling to free themselves from the tyranny\nof old Spain. I do not think any one of them received money. The love\nof freedom and the love of adventure were alike their motive and their\nreward.”\n\n“Mexico owed these men a debt she has forgotten.”\n\n“She forgot it very quickly. In the following year, though they had\nagain defended San Antonio against the Spaniards, the Mexicans drove all\nthe Americans out of the city their rifles had saved.”\n\n“You were here; tell me the true reason.”\n\n“It was not altogether ingratitude. It was the instinct of\nself-preservation. The very bravery of the Americans made the men whom\nthey had defended hate and fear them; and there was a continual influx\nof young men from the States. The Mexicans said to each other: ‘There is\nno end to these Americans. Very soon they will make a quarrel and turn\ntheir arms against us. They do not conform to our customs, and they will\nnot take an order from any officer but their own.’”\n\nHouston smiled. “It is away the Saxon race has,” he said. “The old\nBritons made the same complaint of them. They went first to England to\nhelp the Britons fight the Romans, and they liked the country so well,\nthey determined to stay there. If I remember rightly the old Britons had\nto let them do so.”\n\n“It is an old political situation. You can go back to Genesis and find\nPharaoh arguing about the Jews in the same manner.”\n\n“What happened after this forcible expulsion of the American element\nfrom Texas?”\n\n“Mexican independence was for a time abandoned, and the Spanish viceroys\nwere more tyrannical than ever. But Americans still came, though they\npursued different tactics. They bought land and settled on the great\nrivers. In eighteen twenty-one, Austin, with the permission of the\nSpanish viceroy in Mexico, introduced three hundred families.”\n\n“That was a step in the right direction; but I am astonished the viceroy\nsanctioned it.”\n\n“Apodoca, who was then viceroy, was a Spaniard of the proudest type.\nHe had very much the same contempt for the Mexicans that an old English\nviceroy in New York had for the colonists he was sent to govern. I dare\nsay any of them would have permitted three hundred German families to\nsettle in some part of British America, as far from New York as Texas\nis from Mexico. I do not need to tell you that Austin’s colonists are\na band of choice spirits, hardy working men, trained in the district\nschools of New England and New York--nearly every one of them a farmer\nor mechanic.”\n\n“They were the very material liberty needed. They have made homes.”\n\n“That is the truth. The fighters who preceded them owned nothing but\ntheir horses and their rifles. But these men brought with them their\nwives and their children, their civilization, their inborn love of\nfreedom and national faith. They accepted the guarantee of the Spanish\ngovernment, and they expected the Spanish government to keep its\npromises.”\n\n“It did not.”\n\n“It had no opportunity. The colonists were hardly settled when the\nstandard of revolt against Spain was again raised. Santa Anna took\nthe field for a republican form of government, and once more a body of\nAmericans, under the Tennesseean, Long, joined the Mexican army.”\n\n“I remember that, well.”\n\n“In eighteen twenty-four, Santa Anna, Victoria and Bravo drove the\nSpaniards forever from Mexico, and then they promulgated the famous\nconstitution of eighteen twenty-four. It was a noble constitution,\npurely democratic and federal, and the Texan colonists to a man\ngladly swore to obey it. The form was altogether elective, and what\nparticularly pleased the American element was the fact that the local\ngovernment of every State was left to itself.”\n\nHouston laughed heartily. “Do you know, Worth,” he said, “State Rights\nis our political religion. The average American citizen would expect the\nAlmighty to conform to a written constitution, and recognize the rights\nof mankind.”\n\n“I don’t think he expects more than he gets, Houston. Where is there a\ngrander constitution than is guaranteed to us in His Word; or one that\nmore completely recognizes the rights of all humanity?”\n\n“Thank you, Worth. I see that I have spoken better than I knew. I was\nsitting in the United States Congress, when this constitution passed,\nand very much occupied with the politics of Tennessee.”\n\n“I will not detain you with Mexican politics. It may be briefly said\nthat for the last ten years there has been a constant fight between\nPedraza, Guerrero, Bustamante and Santa Anna for the Presidency of\nMexico. After so much war and misery the country is now ready to resign\nall the blessings the constitution of eighteen twenty-four promised her.\nFor peace she is willing to have a dictator in Santa Anna.”\n\n“If Mexicans want a dictator let them bow down to Santa Anna! But do you\nthink the twenty thousand free-born Americans in Texas are going to have\na dictator? They will have the constitution of eighteen twenty-four--or\nthey will have independence, and make their own constitution! Yes, sir!”\n\n“You know the men for whom you speak?”\n\n“I have been up and down among them for two years. Just after I came\nto Texas I was elected to the convention which sent Stephen Austin to\nMexico with a statement of our wrongs. Did we get any redress? No, sir!\nAnd as for poor Austin, is he not in the dungeons of the Inquisition? We\nhave waited two years for an answer. Great heavens Doctor, surely that\nis long enough!”\n\n“Was this convention a body of any influence?”\n\n“Influence! There were men there whose names will never be forgotten.\nThey met in a log house; they wore buckskin and homespun; but I tell\nyou, sir, they were debating the fate of unborn millions.”\n\n“Two years since Austin went to Mexico?”\n\n“A two years’ chapter of tyranny. In them Santa Anna has quite\noverthrown the republic of which we were a part. He has made himself\ndictator, and, because our authorities have protested against the\nchange, they have been driven from office by a military force. I tell\nyou, sir, the petty outrages everywhere perpetrated by petty officials\nhave filled the cup of endurance. It is boiling over. Now, doctor, what\nare you going to do? Are you with us, or against us?”\n\n“I have told you that I have been with my countrymen always--heart and\nsoul with them.”\n\nThe doctor spoke with some irritation, and Houston laid his closed hand\nhard upon the table to emphasize his reply:\n\n“Heart and soul! Very good! But we want your body now. You must tuck\nyour bowie-knife and your revolvers in your belt, and take your rifle in\nyour hand, and be ready to help us drive the Mexican force out of this\nvery city.”\n\n“When it comes to that I shall be no laggard.”\n\nBut he was deathly pale, for he was suffering as men suffer who feel the\nsweet bonds of wife and children and home, and dread the rending of\nthem apart. In a moment, however, the soul behind his white face made\nit visibly luminous. “Houston,” he said, “whenever the cause of freedom\nneeds me, I am ready. I shall want no second call. But is it not\npossible, that even yet--”\n\n“It is impossible to avert what is already here. Within a few days,\nperhaps to-morrow, you will hear the publication of an edict from Santa\nAnna, ordering every American to give up his arms.”\n\n“What! Give up our arms! No, no, by Heaven! I will die fighting for\nmine, rather.”\n\n“Exactly. That is how every white man in Texas feels about it. And if\nsuch a wonder as a coward existed among them, he understands that he\nmay as well die fighting Mexicans, as die of hunger or be scalped by\nIndians. A large proportion of the colonists depend on their rifles for\ntheir daily food. All of them know that they must defend their own\nhomes from the Comanche, or see them perish. Now, do you imagine that\nAmericans will obey any such order? By all the great men of seventeen\nseventy-five, if they did, I would go over to the Mexicans and help them\nto wipe the degenerate cowards out of existence!”\n\nHe rose as he spoke; he looked like a flame, and his words cut like a\nsword. Worth caught fire at his vehemence and passion. He clasped his\nhands in sympathy as he walked with him to the door. They stood silently\ntogether for a moment on the threshold, gazing into the night. Over the\nglorious land the full moon hung, enamoured. Into the sweet, warm air\nmockingbirds were pouring low, broken songs of ineffable melody. The\nwhite city in the mystical light looked like an enchanted city. It was\nso still that the very houses looked asleep.\n\n“It is a beautiful land,” said the doctor.\n\n“It is worthy of freedom,” answered Houston. Then he went with long,\nswinging steps down the garden, and into the shadows beyond, and Worth\nturned in and closed the door.\n\nHe had been watching for this very hour for twenty years; and yet he\nfound himself wholly unprepared for it. Like one led by confused and\nuncertain thoughts, he went about the room mechanically locking up his\npapers, and the surgical instruments he valued so highly. As he did so\nhe perceived the book he had been reading when Houston entered. It was\nlying open where he had laid it down. A singular smile flitted over\nhis face. He lifted it and carried it closer to the light. It was his\ncollege Cicero.\n\n“I was nineteen years old when I marked that passage,” he said; “and I\ndo not think I have ever read it since, until to-night. I was reading it\nwhen Houston came into the room. Is it a message, I wonder?--\n\n“‘But when thou considerest everything carefully and thoughtfully; of\nall societies none is of more importance, none more dear, than that\nwhich unites us with the commonwealth. Our parents, children, relations\nand neighbors are dear, but our fatherland embraces the whole round of\nthese endearments. In its defence, who would not dare to die, if only he\ncould assist it?”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. THE SHINING BANDS OF LOVE.\n\n        “O blest be he!  O blest be he!\n            Let him all blessings prove,\n         Who made the chains, the shining chains,\n            The holy chains of love!”\n                         --Spanish Ballad.\n        “If you love a lady bright,\n            Seek, and you shall find a way\n            All that love would say, to say\n         If you watch the occasion right.”\n                         --Spanish Ballad.\n\nIn the morning Isabel took breakfast with her sister. This was always\na pleasant event to Antonia. She petted Isabel, she waited upon her,\nsweetened her chocolate, spread her cakes with honey, and listened to\nall her complaints of Tia Rachela. Isabel came gliding in when Antonia\nwas about half way through the meal. Her scarlet petticoat was gorgeous,\nher bodice white as snow, her hair glossy as a bird’s wing, but her lips\ndrooped and trembled, and there was the shadow of tears in her eyes.\nAntonia kissed their white fringed lids, held the little form close\nin her arms, and fluttered about in that motherly way which Isabel had\nlearned to demand and enjoy.\n\n“What has grieved you this morning, little dove?”\n\n“It is Tia Rachela, as usual. The cross old woman! She is going to tell\nmi madre something. Antonia, you must make her keep her tongue between\nher teeth. I promised her to confess to Fray Ignatius, and she said\nI must also tell mi madre. I vowed to say twenty Hail Marias and ten\nGlorias, and she said ‘I ought to go back to the convent.’”\n\n“But what dreadful thing have you been doing, Iza?”\n\nIza blushed and looked into her chocolate cup, as she answered\nslowly: “I gave--a--flower--away. Only a suchil flower, Antonia,\nthat--I--wore--at--my--breast--last--night.”\n\n“Whom did you give it to, Iza?”\n\nIza hesitated, moved her chair close to Antonia, and then hid her face\non her sister’s breast.\n\n“But this is serious, darling. Surely you did not give it to Senor\nHouston?”\n\n“Could you think I was so silly? When madre was talking to him last\nnight, and when I was singing my pretty serenade, he heard nothing at\nall. He was thinking his own thoughts.”\n\n“Not to Senor Houston? Who then? Tell me, Iza.”\n\n“To--Don Luis.”\n\n“Don Luis! But he is not here. He went to the Colorado.”\n\n“How stupid are you, Antonia! In New York they did not teach you to\nput this and that together. As soon as I saw Senor Houston, I said to\nmyself: ‘Don Luis was going to him; very likely they have met each other\non the road; very likely Don Luis is back in San Antonio. He would\nnot want to go away without bidding me good-by,’ and, of course, I was\nright.”\n\n“But when did you see him last night? You never left the room.”\n\n“So many things are possible. My heart said to me when the talk was going\non, ‘Don Luis is waiting under the oleanders,’ and I walked on to the\nbalcony and there he was, and he looked so sad, and I dropped my\nsuchil flower to him; and Rachela saw me, for I think she has a million\neyes,--and that is the whole matter.”\n\n“But why did not Don Luis come in?”\n\n“Mi madre forbade me to speak to him. That is the fault of the\nValdez’s.”\n\n“Then you disobeyed mi madre, and you know what Fray Ignatius and the\nSisters have taught you about the fourth command.”\n\n“Oh, indeed, I did not think of the fourth command! A sin without\nintention has not penance; and consider, Antonia, I am now sixteen,\nand they would shut me up like a chicken in its shell. Antonia, sweet\nAntonia, speak to Rachela, and make your little Iza happy. Fear is so\nbad for me. See, I do not even care for my cakes and honey this morning.\n\n“I will give Rachela the blue silk kerchief I brought from New York. She\nwill forget a great deal for that, and then, Iza, darling, you must tell\nFray Ignatius of your sin, because it is not good to have an unconfessed\nsin on the soul.”\n\n“Antonia, do not say such cruel things. I have confessed to you. Fray\nIgnatius will give me a hard penance. Perhaps he may say to mi madre:\n‘That child had better go back to the convent. I say so, because I\nhave knowledge.’ And now I am tired of that life; I am almost a woman,\nAntonia, am I not?”\n\nAntonia looked tenderly into her face. She saw some inscrutable change\nthere. All was the same, and all was different. She did not understand\nthat it was in the eyes, those lookouts of the soul. They had lost the\nfrank, inquisitive stare of childhood; they were tender and misty;\nthey reflected a heart passionate and fearful, in which love was making\nhimself lord of all.\n\nAntonia was not without experience. There was in New York a gay,\nhandsome youth, to whom her thoughts lovingly turned. She had promised\nto trust him, and to wait for him, and neither silence nor distance\nhad weakened her faith or her affection. Don Luis had also made her\nunderstand how hard it was to leave Isabel, just when he had hoped to\nwoo and win her. He had asked her to watch over his beloved, and to say\na word in his favor when all others would be condemning him.\n\nHer sympathy had been almost a promise, and, indeed, she thought Isabel\ncould hardly have a more suitable lover. He was handsome, gallant, rich,\nand of good morals and noble family. They had been much together in\ntheir lives; their childish affection had been permitted; she felt quite\nsure that the parents of both had contemplated a stronger affection and\na more lasting tie between them.\n\nAnd evidently Don Luis had advanced further in his suit than the Senora\nwas aware of. He had not been able to resist the charm of secretly\nwooing the fresh young girl he hoped to make his wife. Their love must\nbe authorized and sanctioned; true, he wished that; but the charm\nof winning the prize before it was given was irresistible. Antonia\ncomprehended all without many words; but she took her sister into the\ngarden, where they could be quite alone, and she sought the girl’s\nconfidence because she was sure she could be to her a loving guide.\n\nIsabel was ready enough to talk, and the morning was conducive to\nconfidence. They strolled slowly between the myrtle hedges in the\nsweet gloom of overshadowing trees, hearing only like a faint musical\nconfusion the mingled murmur of the city.\n\n“It was just here,” said Isabel. “I was walking and sitting and doing\nnothing at all but looking at the trees and the birds and feeling happy,\nand Don Luis came to me. He might have come down from the skies, I was\nso astonished. And he looked so handsome, and he said such words! Oh,\nAntonia! they went straight to my heart.”\n\n“When was this, dear?”\n\n“It was in the morning. I had been to mass with Rachela. I had said\nevery prayer with my whole heart, and Rachela told me I might stay in\nthe garden until the sun grew hot. And as soon as Rachela was gone, Don\nLuis came--came just as sudden as an angel.”\n\n“He must have followed you from mass.”\n\n“Perhaps.”\n\n“He should not have done that.”\n\n“If a thing is delightful, nobody should do it. Luis said he knew that\nit was decided that we should marry, but that he wanted me to be his\nwife because I loved him. His face was shining with joy, his eyes were\nlike two stars, he called me his life, his adorable mistress, his queen,\nand he knelt down and took my hands and kissed them. I was too happy to\nspeak.”\n\n“Oh, Iza!”\n\n“Very well, Antonia! It is easy to say ‘Oh, Iza’; but what would you\nhave done? And reflect on this; no one, not even Rachela, saw him. So\nthen, our angels were quite agreeable and willing. And I--I was in such\njoy, that I went straight in and told Holy Maria of my happiness. But\nwhen a person has not been in love, how can they know; and I see that\nyou are going to say as Sister Sacrementa said to Lores Valdez--‘You are\na wicked girl, and such things are not to be spoken of!’”\n\n“Oh, my darling one, I am not so cruel. I think you did nothing very\nwrong, Iza. When love comes into your soul, it is like a new life. If it\nis a pure, good love, it is a kind of murder to kill it in any way.”\n\n“It has just struck me, Antonia, that you may be in love also.”\n\n“When I was in New York, our brother Jack had a friend, and he loved me,\nand I loved him.”\n\n“But did grandmamma let him talk to you?”\n\n“He came every night. We went walking and driving. In the summer we\nsailed upon the river; in the winter we skated upon the ice. He helped\nme with my lessons. He went with me to church.”\n\n“And was grandmamma with you?”\n\n“Very seldom. Often Jack was with us; more often we were quite alone.”\n\n“Holy Virgin! Who ever heard tell of such good fortune? Consuelo\nLadrello had never been an hour alone with Don Domingo before they were\nmarried.”\n\n“A good girl does not need a duenna to watch her; that is what I think.\nAnd an American girl, pure and free, would not suffer herself to be\nwatched by any woman, old or young. Her lover comes boldly into her\nhome; she is too proud, to meet him in secret.”\n\n“Ah! that would be a perfect joy. That is what I would like! But fancy\nwhat Rachela would say; and mi madre would cover her eyes and refuse\nto see me if I said such words. Believe this. It was in the spring Luis\ntold me that he loved me, and though I have seen him often since, he\nhas never found another moment to speak to me alone, not for one five\nminutes. Oh, Antonia! let me have one five minutes this afternoon! He\nis going away, and there is to be war, and I may never, never see him\nagain!”\n\n“Do not weep, little dove. How can you see him this afternoon?”\n\n“He will be here, in this very place, I know he will. When he put the\nsuchil flower to his lips last night he made me understand it. This\nafternoon, during the hour of siesta, will you come with me? Only for\nfive minutes, Antonia! You can manage Rachela, I am sure you can.”\n\n“I can manage Rachela, and you shall have one whole hour, Iza. One\nwhole hour! Come, now, we must make a visit to our mother. She will be\nwondering at our delay.”\n\nThe Senora had not yet risen. She had taken her chocolate and smoked her\ncigarito, but was still drowsing. “I have had a bad night, children,”\n she said full of dreadful dreams. “It must have been that American. Yet,\nHoly Mother, how handsome he is! And I assure you that he has the good\nmanners of a courtier. Still, it was an imprudence, and Senora Valdez\nwill make some great thing of it.”\n\n“You were in your own house, mother. What has Senora Valdez to do with\nthe guest in it? We might as well make some great thing about Captain\nMorello being present at her party.”\n\n“I have to say to you, Antonia, that Morello is a Castilian; his family\nis without a cross. He has the parchments of his noble ancestry to\nshow.”\n\n“And Senor Houston is an American--Scotch-American, he said, last night.\nPardon, my mother, but do you know what the men of Scotland are?”\n\n“Si!, They are monsters! Fray Ignatius has told me. They are heretics\nof the worst kind. It is their special delight to put to death good\nCatholic priests. I saw that in a book; it must be true.”\n\n“Oh, no, mother! It is not true! It is mere nonsense. Scotchmen do not\nmolest priests, women, and children. They are the greatest fighters in\nthe world.”\n\n“Quien sabe? Who has taught you so much about these savages?”\n\n“Indeed, mother, they are not savages. They are a very learned race of\nmen, and very pious also. Jack has many Scotch-American friends. I know\none of them very well”; and with the last words her face flushed, and\nher voice fell insensibly into slow and soft inflections.\n\n“Jack knows many of them! That is likely. Your father would send him to\nNew York. All kinds of men are in New York. Fray Ignatius says they have\nto keep an army of police there. No wonder! And my son is so full\nof nobilities, so generous, so honorable, he will not keep himself\nexclusive. He is the true resemblance of my brother Don Juan Flores.\nJuan was always pitying the poor and making friends with those beneath\nhim. At last he went into the convent of the Bernardines and died like a\nvery saint.”\n\n“I think our Jack will be more likely to die like a very hero. If there\nis any thing Jack hates, it is oppression. He would right a beggar, if\nhe saw him wronged.”\n\n“Poco a poco! I am tired of rights and wrongs. Let us talk a little\nabout our dresses, for there will be a gay winter. Senora Valdez assured\nme of it; many soldiers are coming here, and we shall have parties, and\ncock-fights, and, perhaps, even a bull-feast.”\n\n“Oh!” cried Isabel clapping her hands enthusiastically; “a bull-feast!\nThat is what I long to see!”\n\nAt this moment the doctor entered the room, and Isabel ran to meet\nhim. No father could have resisted her pretty ways, her kisses, her\nendearments, her coaxing diminutives of speech, her childlike loveliness\nand simplicity.\n\n“What is making you so happy, Queridita?” [1]\n\n“Mi madre says there is perhaps to be a bullfeast this winter. Holy\nVirgin, think of it! That is the one thing I long to see!”\n\nWith her clinging arms around him, and her eager face lifted to his for\nsympathy, the father could not dash the hope which he knew in his heart\nwas very unlikely to be realized. Neither did he think it necessary\nto express opposition or disapproval for what had as yet no tangible\nexistence. So he answered her with smiles and caresses, and a little\nquotation which committed him to nothing:\n\n        “As, Panem et Circenses was the cry\n        Among the Roman populace of old;\n        So, Pany Toros! is the cry of Spain.”\n\n\nThe Senora smiled appreciatively and put out her hand. “Pan y Toros!”\n she repeated. “And have you reflected, children, that no other nation\nin the world cries it. Only Spain and her children! That is because\nonly men of the Spanish race are brave enough to fight bulls, and only\nSpanish bulls are brave enough to fight men.”\n\nShe was quite pleased with herself for this speech, and finding no one\ninclined to dispute the statement, she went on to describe a festival\nof bulls she had been present at in the city of Mexico. The subject\ndelighted her, and she grew eloquent over it; and, conscious only of\nIsabel’s shining eyes and enthusiastic interest, she did not notice the\nair of thoughtfulness which had settled over her husband’s face, nor yet\nAntonia’s ill-disguised weariness and anxiety.\n\nOn the night of the Valdez’s party her father had said he would talk\nwith her. Antonia was watching for the confidence, but not with any\ngreat desire. Her heart and her intelligence told her it would mean\ntrouble, and she had that natural feeling of youth which gladly\npostpones the evil day. And while her father was silent she believed\nthere were still possibilities of escape from it. So she was not sorry\nthat he again went to his office in the city without any special word\nfor her. It was another day stolen from the uncertain future, for the\ncalm usage of the present, and she was determined to make happiness in\nit.\n\nWhen all was still in the afternoon Isabel came to her. She would not\nput the child to the necessity of again asking her help. She rose at\nonce, and said:\n\n“Sit here, Iza, until I have opened the door for us. Then she took a\nrich silk kerchief, blue as the sky, in her hand, and went to the wide,\nmatted hall. There she found Rachela, asleep on a cane lounge. Antonia\nwoke her.\n\n“Rachela, I wish to go into the garden for an hour.”\n\n“The Senorita does the thing she wants to, Rachela would not presume to\ninterfere. The Senorita became an Americano in New York.”\n\n“There are good things in New York, Rachela; for instance, this\nkerchief.”\n\n“That is indeed magnificent!”\n\n“If you permit my sister to walk in the garden with me, I shall give it\nto you this moment.”\n\n“Dona Isabel is different. She is a Mexicaine. She must be watched\ncontinually.”\n\n“For what reason? She is as innocent as an angel.”\n\n“Let her simply grow up, and you will see that she is not innocent as\nthe angels. Oh, indeed! I could say something about last night! Dona\nIsabel has no vocation for a nun; but, gracias a Dios! Rachela is not\nyet blind or deaf.”\n\n“Let the child go with me for an hour, Rachela. The kerchief will be so\nbecoming to you. There is not another in San Antonio like it.”\n\nRachela was past forty, but not yet past the age of coquetry. “It will\nlook gorgeous with my gold ear-rings, but--”\n\n“I will give you also the blue satin bow like it, to wear at your\nbreast.”\n\n“Si, si! I will give the permission, Senorita--for your sake alone. The\nkerchief and bow are a little thing to you. To me, they will be a great\nadornment. You are not to leave the garden, however, and for one hour’s\nwalk only, Senorita; certainly there is time for no more.”\n\n“I will take care of Isabel; no harm shall come to her. You may keep\nyour eyes shut for one hour, Rachela, and you may shut your ears also,\nand put your feet on the couch and let them rest. I will watch Isabel\ncarefully, be sure of that.”\n\n“The child is very clever, and she has a lover already, I fear. Keep\nyour eyes on the myrtle hedge that skirts the road. I have to say\nthis--it is not for nothing she wants to walk with you this afternoon.\nShe would be better fast asleep.”\n\nIn a few moments the kerchief and the bow were safely folded in the\ncapacious pocket of Rachela’s apron, and Isabel and Antonia were softly\ntreading the shady walk between the myrtle hedges. Rachela’s eyes were\napparently fast closed when the girls pased{sic} her, but she did not\nfail to notice how charmingly Isabel had dressed herself. She wore, it\nis true, her Spanish costume; but she had red roses at her breast, and\nher white lace mantilla over her head.\n\n“Ah! she is a clever little thing!” Rachela muttered. “She knows that\nshe is irresistible in her Castilian dress. Bah! those French frocks are\nenough to drive a man a mile away. I can almost forgive her now. Had she\nworn the French frock I would not have forgiven her. I would never have\nyielded again, no, not even if the Senorita Antonia should offer me her\nscarlet Indian shawl worked in gold. I was always a fool--Holy Mother\nforgive me! Well, then; I used to have my own lovers--plenty of\nthem--handsome young arrieros and rancheros: there was Tadeo, a valento\nof the first class: and Buffa--and--well, I will sleep; they do not\nremember me, I dare say; and I have forgotten their names.”\n\nIn the mean time the sisters sat down beneath a great fig-tree. No\nsunshine, no shower, could penetrate its thick foliage. The wide space\nbeneath the spreading branches was a little parlor, cool and sweet,\nand full of soft, green lights, and the earthy smell of turf, and the\nwandering scents of the garden.\n\nIsabel’s eyes shone with an incomparable light. She was pale, but\nexquisitely beautiful, and even her hands and feet expressed the idea of\nexpectation. Antonia had a piece of needlework in her hand. She affected\nthe calmness she did not feel, for her heart was trembling for the\ntender little heart beating with so much love and anxiety beside her.\n\nBut Isabel’s divination, however arrived at, was not at fault. In a\nfew moments Don Luis lightly leaped the hedge, and without a moment’s\nhesitation sought the shadow of the fig-tree. As he approached, Antonia\nlooked at him with a new interest. It was not only that he loved Isabel,\nbut that Isabel loved him. She had given him sympathy before, now she\ngave him a sister’s affection.\n\n“How handsome he is!” she thought. “How gallant he looks in his velvet\nand silver and embroidered jacket! And how eager are his steps! And how\njoyful his face! He is the kind of Romeo that Shakespeare dreamed about!\nIsabel is really an angel to him. He would really die for her. What\nhas this Spanish knight of the sixteenth century to do in Texas in the\nnineteenth century?”\n\nHe answered her mental question in his own charming way. He was so\nhappy, so radiantly happy, so persuasive, so compelling, that Antonia\ngranted him, without a word, the favor his eyes asked for. And the\nlovers hardly heard the excuse she made; they understood nothing of it,\nonly that she would be reading in the myrtle walk for one hour, and, by\nso doing, would protect them from intrusion.\n\nOne whole hour! Isabel had thought the promise a perfect magnificence of\nopportunity{.??} But how swiftly it went. Luis had not told her the half\nof his love and his hopes. He had been forced to speak of politics and\nbusiness, and every such word was just so many stolen from far sweeter\nwords--words that fell like music from his lips, and were repeated with\ninfinite power from his eyes. Low words, that had the pleading of a\nthousand voices in them; words full of melody, thrilling with romance;\npoetical, and yet real as the sunshine around them.\n\nIn lovers of a colder race, bound by conventional ties, and a dress\nrigorously divested of every picturesque element, such wooing might have\nappeared ridiculous; but in Don Luis, the most natural thing about\nit was its extravagance. When he knelt at the feet of his beloved\nand kissed her hands, the action was the unavoidable outcome of his\ntemperament. When he said to her, “Angel mio! you are the light of my\ndarkness, the perfume of all flowers that bloom for me, the love of my\nloves, my life, my youth, my lyre, my star, had I a thousand souls with\nwhich to love, I would give them all to you!” he believed every word he\nuttered, and he uttered every word with the passion of a believer.\n\nHe stirred into life also in the heart of Isabel a love as living as\nhis own. In that hour she stepped outside all of her childhood’s\nimmaturities. She became a woman. She accepted with joyful tears a\nwoman’s lot of love and sorrow. She said to Antonia:\n\n“Luis was in my heart before; now, I have put him in my soul. My soul\nwill never die. So I shall never forget him--never cease to love him.”\n\nRachela faithfully kept her agreement. For one hour she was asleep to\nall her charge did, and Isabel was in her own room when the precious\nsixty minutes were over. Happy? So happy that her soul seemed to have\npushed her body aside, as a thing not to be taken into account. She\nsang like a bird for very gladsomeness. It was impossible for her to\nbe still, and as she went about her room with little dancing, balancing\nmovements of her hands and feet, Antonia knew that they were keeping\ntheir happy rhythmic motion to the melody love sang in her heart.\n\nAnd she rejoiced with her little sister, though she was not free from\na certain regret for her concession, for it is the after-reckoning with\nconscience that is so disagreeably strict and uncomfortable. And yet,\nwhy make an element of anger and suspicion between Isabel and her mother\nwhen there appeared to be no cause to do so? Don Luis was going away. He\nwas in disgrace with his family--almost disinherited; the country was on\nthe point of war, and its fortunes might give him some opportunities no\none now foresaw. But if Isabel’s mother had once declared that she would\n“never sanction the marriage,” Antonia knew that, however she might\nafterwards regret her haste and prejudice, she would stand passionately\nby her decision. Was it not better, then, to prevent words being said\nwhich might cause sorrow and regret in the future?\n\nBut as regarded Isabel’s father, no such reason existed. The happiness\nof his children was to him a more sacred thing than his own prejudices.\nHe liked Don Luis, and his friendship with his mother, the Senora\nAlveda, was a long and tried one. The youth’s political partialities,\nthough bringing him at present into disgrace, were such as he himself\nhad largely helped to form. Antonia was sure that her father would\nsympathize with Isabel, and excuse in her the lapse of duty which had\ngiven his little girl so much happiness. Yes, it would be right to tell\nhim every thing, and she did not fear but Isabel would agree in her\ndecision.\n\nAt this moment Rachela entered. The Senora wished her daughters to\ncall upon the American manteau-maker for her, and the ride in the open\ncarriage to the Plaza would enable them to bow to their acquaintances,\nand exhibit their last new dresses from New Orleans. Rachela was already\nprepared for the excursion, and she was not long in attiring Isabel.\n\n“To be sure, the siesta has made you look charming this afternoon,” she\nsaid, looking steadily into the girl’s beaming, blushing face, “and this\nrose silk is enchanting. Santa Maria, how I pity the officers who will\nhave the great fortune to see you this afternoon, and break their hearts\nfor the sight! But you must not look at them, mark! I shall tell the\nSenora if you do. It is enough if they look at you. And the American way\nof the Senorita Antonia, which is to bow and smile to every admirer,\nit will but make more enchanting the becoming modesty of the high-born\nMexicaine.”\n\n“Keep your tongue still, Rachela. Ah! if you strike me, I will go to\nmy father. He will not permit it. I am not a child to be struck and\nscolded, and told when to open and shut my eyes. I shall do as my sister\ndoes, and the Holy Mother herself will be satisfied with me!”\n\n“Chito! Chito!! You wicked one! Oh, Maria Santissima, cast on this child\na look of compassion! The American last night has bewitched her! I said\nthat he looked like a Jew.”\n\n“I am not wicked, Rachela; and gracias a Dios, there is no Inquisition\nnow to put the question!”\n\nIsabel was in a great passion, or the awful word that had made lips\nparch and blanch to utter it for generations would never have been\nlaunched at the offending woman’s head. But its effect was magical.\nRachela put up her hands palm outwards, as if to shield herself from\na blow, and then without another word stooped down and tied the satin\nsandals on Isabel’s restless feet. She was muttering prayers during the\nwhole action, for Isabel had been quick to perceive her advantage,\nand was following it up by a defiant little monologue of rebellious\nspeeches.\n\nIn the midst of this scene, Antonia entered. She was dressed for the\ncarriage, and the carriage stood at the door waiting; but her face was\nfull of fear, and she said, hurriedly:\n\n“Rachela, can you not make some excuse to my mother which will permit us\nto remain at home? Hark! There is something wrong in the city.”\n\nIn a moment the three women were on the balcony, intently, anxiously\nlistening. Then they were aware of a strange confusion in the subtle,\namber atmosphere. It was as if they heard the noise of battle afar\noff; and Rachela, without a word, glided away to the Senora. Isabel and\nAntonia stood hand in hand, listening to the vague trouble and the echo\nof harsh, grating voices, mingled with the blare of clarions, the roll\nof drums, and the rattle of scattering rifle-shots. Yet the noises were\nso blended together, so indistinct, so strangely expressive of both\nlaughter and defiance, that it was impossible to identify or describe\nthem.\n\nSuddenly a horseman came at a rapid pace towards the house, and Antonia,\nleaning over the balcony, saw him deliver a note to Rachela, and then\nhurry away at the same reckless speed. The note was from the doctor to\nhis wife, and it did not tend to allay their anxiety. “Keep within the\nhouse,” it said; “there are difficulties in the city. In an hour or two\nI will be at home.”\n\nBut it was near midnight when he arrived, and Antonia saw that he was\na different man. He looked younger. His blue eyes shone with the\nlight behind them. On his face there was the impress of an invincible\ndetermination. His very walk had lost its listless, gliding tread, and\nhis steps were firm, alert and rapid.\n\nNo one had been able to go to bed until he arrived, though Isabel slept\nrestlessly in her father’s chair, and the Senora lay upon the couch,\ndrowsing a little between her frequent attacks of weeping and angry\nanticipation. For she was sure it was the Americans. “Anything was\npossible with such a man as Sam Houston near the city.”\n\n“Perhaps it is Santa Anna,” at length suggested Antonia. “He has been\nmaking trouble ever since I can remember. He was born with a sword in\nhis hand, I think.”\n\n“Ca! And every American with a rifle in his hand! Santa Anna is a\nmonster, but at least he fights for his own country. Texas is not the\ncountry of the Americans.”\n\n“But, indeed, they believe that Texas is their country”; and to these\nwords Doctor Worth entered.\n\n“What is the matter? What is the matter, Roberto? I have been made sick\nwith these uncertainties. Why did you not come home at the Angelus?”\n\n“I have had a good reason for my delay, Maria. About three o’clock I\nreceived a message from the Senora Alveda, and I visited her. She is\nin great trouble, and she had not been able to bear it with her usual\nfortitude. She bad fainted.”\n\n“Ah, the poor mother! She has a son who will break her heart.”\n\n“She made no complaint of Luis. She is distracted about her country, and\nas I came home I understood why. For she is a very shrewd woman, and she\nperceives that Santa Anna is preparing trouble enough for it.”\n\n“Well, then, what is it?”\n\n“When I left her house, I noticed many Americans, as well as many\nMexicans, on the streets. They were standing together, too; and there\nwas something in their faces, and in the way their arms were carried,\nwhich was very striking and portentous. I fancied they looked coldly\non me, and I was troubled by the circumstance. In the Plaza I saw the\nmilitary band approaching, accompanied by half a dozen officers and a\nfew soldiers. The noise stopped suddenly, and Captain Morello proclaimed\nas a bando (edict) of the highest authority, an order for all Americans\nto surrender their arms of every description to the officials and at the\nplaces notified.”\n\n“Very good!”\n\n“Maria, nothing could be worse! Nothing could be more shameful and\ndisastrous. The Americans had evidently been expecting this useless\nbombast, and ere the words were well uttered, they answered them with\na yell of defiance. I do not think more than one proclamation was\nnecessary, but Morello went from point to point in the city and the\nAmericans followed him. I can tell you this, Maria: all the millions\nin Mexico can not take their rifles from the ten thousand Americans in\nTexas, able to carry them.”\n\n“We shall see! We shall see! But, Roberto, you at least will not\ninterfere in their quarrels. You have never done so hitherto.”\n\n“No one has ever proposed to disarm me before, Maria. I tell you\nfrankly, I will not give up a single rifle, or revolver, or weapon of\nany kind, that I possess. I would rather be slain with them. I have\nnever carried arms before, but I shall carry them now. I apologize to my\ncountrymen for not having them with me this afternoon. My dearest wife!\nMy good Maria! do not cry in that despairing way.”\n\n“You will be killed, Roberto! You will be a rebel! You will be shot like\na dog, and then what will become of me and my daughters?”\n\n“You have two sons, Maria. They will avenge their father, and protect\ntheir mother and sisters.”\n\n“I shall die of shame! I shall die of shame and sorrow!”\n\n“Not of shame, Maria. If I permitted these men to deprive me of my arms,\nyou might well die of shame.”\n\n“What is it? Only a gun, or a pistol, that you never use?”\n\n“Great God, Maria! It is everything! It is honor! It is liberty! It is\nrespect to myself! It is loyalty to my country! It is fidelity to\nmy countrymen! It is true that for many years the garrison has fully\nprotected us, and I have not needed to use the arms in my house. But\nthousands of husbands and fathers need them hourly, to procure food for\ntheir children and wives, and to protect them from the savages. One\ntie binds us. Their cause is my cause. Their country is my country, and\ntheir God is my God. Children, am I right or wrong?”\n\nThey both stepped swiftly to his side. Isabel laid her cheek against\nhis, and answered him with a kiss. Antonia clasped his hand, stood close\nto him, and said: “We are all sure that you are right, dear father. My\nmother is weary and sick with anxiety, but she thinks so too. Mother\nalways thinks as you do, father. Dear mother, here is Rachela with a cup\nof chocolate, and you will sleep and grow strong before morning.”\n\nBut the Senora, though she suffered her daughter’s caresses, did not\nanswer them, neither did she speak to her husband, though he opened the\ndoor for her and stood waiting with a face full of anxious love for a\nword or a smile from her. And the miserable wife, still more miserable\nthan her husband, noticed that Isabel did not follow her. Never before\nhad Isabel seemed to prefer any society to her mother’s, and the unhappy\nSenora felt the defection, even amid her graver trouble.\n\nBut Isabel had seen something new in her father that night; something\nthat touched her awakening soul with admiration. She lingered with him\nand Antonia, listening with vague comprehension to their conversation,\nuntil Rachela called her angrily; and as she was not brave enough for a\nsecond rebellion that night, she obediently answered her summons.\n\nAn hour afterwards, Antonia stepped cautiously within her room. She was\nsleeping, and smiling in her sleep. Where was her loving, innocent soul\nwandering? Between the myrtle hedges and under the fig-tree with her\nlover? Oh, who can tell where the soul goes when sleep gives it some\nrelease? Perhaps it is at night our angels need to watch us most\ncarefully. For the soul, in dreams, can visit evil and sorrowful places,\nas well as happy and holy ones. But Isabel slept and smiled, and Antonia\nwhispered a prayer at her side ere she went to her own rest.\n\nAnd the waning moon cast a pathetic beauty over the Eden-like land, till\ndawn brought that mystical silence in which every new day is born. Then\nRobert Worth rose from the chair in which he had been sitting so long,\nremembering the past and forecasting the future. He walked to the\nwindow, opened it, and looked towards the mountains. They had an\nethereal hue, a light without rays, a clearness almost polar in its\nseverity. But in some way their appearance infused into his soul\ncalmness and strength.\n\n“Liberty has always been bought with life, and the glory of the greatest\nnations handseled with the blood of their founders.” This was the\nthought in his heart, as looking far off to the horizon, he asked\nhopefully:\n\n       “What then, O God, shall this good land produce\n        That Thou art watering it so carefully?”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. A FAMOUS BARBECUE.\n\n        “So when fierce zeal a nation rends,\n            And stern injustice rules the throne,\n         Beneath the yoke meek virtue bends,\n            And modest truth is heard to groan.\n         But when fair Freedom’s star appears,\n         Then hushed are sighs, and calmed are fears.\n         And who, when nations long opprest,\n            Decree to curb the oppressor’s pride,\n         And patriot virtues fire the breast,\n            Who shall the generous ardor chide?\n         What shall withstand the great decree,\n         When a brave nation will be free?\n\nIt is flesh and blood that makes husbands and wives, fathers and\nchildren, and for the next few days these ties were sorely wounded in\nRobert Worth’s house. The Senora was what Rachela called “difficult.” In\nreality, she was angry and sullen. At such times she always went early\nto mass, said many prayers, and still further irritated herself by\nunnecessary fasting. But there are few homes which totally escape the\nvisitations of this ‘pious temper’ in some form or other. And no creed\nmodifies it; the strict Calvinist and strict Catholic are equally\ndisagreeable while under its influence.\n\nBesides, the Senora, like the ill-tempered prophet, thought she “did\nwell to be angry.” She imagined herself deserted and betrayed in all\nher tenderest feelings, her husband a rebel, her home made desolate, her\nsons and daughters supporting their father’s imprudent views. She could\nonly see one alternative before her; she must choose between her country\nand her religion, or her husband and children.\n\nTrue, she had not yet heard from her sons, but she would listen to none\nof Rachela’s hopes regarding them. Thomas had always said yes to all his\nfather’s opinions. How could she expect anything from John when he was\nbeing carefully trained in the very principles which everywhere made the\nAmericans so irritating to the Mexican government.\n\nHer husband and Antonia she would not see. Isabel she received in her\ndarkened room, with passionate weeping and many reproaches. The unhappy\nhusband had expected this trouble at the outset. It was one of those\ndomestic thorns which fester and hamper, but to which the very best\nof men have to submit. He could only send pleasant and affectionate\nmessages by Rachela, knowing that Rachela would deliver them with her\nown modifications of tone and manner.\n\n“The Senor sends his great love to the Senora. Grace of Mary! If he\nwould do a little as the most wise and tender of spouses wishes him!\nThat would be for the good fortune of every one.\n\n“Ah, Rachela, my heart is broken! Bring me my mantilla. I will go to\nearly mass, when one’s husband and children forsake them, who, then, is\npossible but the Holy Mother?\n\n“My Senora, you will take cold; the morning is chill; besides, I have to\nsay the streets will be full of those insolent Americans.”\n\n“I shall be glad to take cold, perhaps even to die. And the Americans do\nnot offend women. Even the devil has his good points.”\n\n“Holy Virgin! Offend women! They do not even think us worth looking\nat. But then it is an intolerable offence to see them standing in our\nstreets, as if they had made the whole land.”\n\nBut this morning, early as it was, the streets were empty of Americans.\nThere had been hundreds of them there at the proclamation; there was not\none to be seen twelve hours afterwards. But at the principal rendezvous\nof the city, and on the very walls of the Alamo, they had left this\ncharacteristic notice:\n\n     “To SANTA ANNA:\n\n     “If you want our arms-take them.\n\n     “TEN THOUSAND AMERICAN TEXANS.”\n\nRobert Worth saw it with an irrepressible emotion of pride and\nsatisfaction. He had faithfully fulfilled his promise to his conscience,\nand, with his rifle across his shoulder, and his revolvers and knife\nin his belt, was taking the road to his office with a somewhat marked\ndeliberation. He was yet a remarkably handsome man; and what man is\nthere that a rifle does not give a kind of nobility to? With an up-head\ncarriage and the light of his soul in his face, he trod the narrow,\nuneven street like a soldier full of enthusiasm at his own commission.\n\nNo one interfered with his solitary parade. He perceived, indeed,\na marked approval of it. The Zavalas, Navarros. Garcias, and other\nprominent citizens, addressed him with but a slightly repressed\nsympathy. They directed his attention with meaning looks to the\ncounter-proclamation of the Americans. They made him understand by the\npressure of their hands that they also were on the side of liberty.\n\nAs he did not hurry, he met several officers, but they wisely affected\nnot to see what they did not wish to see. For Doctor Worth was a person\nto whom very wide latitude might be given. To both the military and\nthe civilians his skill was a necessity. The attitude he had taken was\nprivately discussed, but no one publicly acted or even commented upon\nit. Perhaps he was a little disappointed at this. He had come to a point\nwhen a frank avowal of his opinions would be a genuine satisfaction;\nwhen, in fact, his long-repressed national feeling was imperious.\n\nOn the third morning, as he crossed the Plaza, some one called him. The\nvoice made his heart leap; his whole nature responded to it like the\nstrings of a harp to the sweep of a skilful hand. He turned quickly,\nand saw two young men galloping towards him. The foremost figure was his\nson--his beloved youngest son--whom he had just been thinking of as well\nout of danger, safe and happy in the peaceful halls of Columbia. And lo!\nhere he was in the very home of the enemy; and he was glad of it.\n\n“Why, Jack!” he cried; “Why, Jack, my boy! I never thought of you here.”\n He had his hand on the lad’s shoulder, and was gazing into his bright\nface with tears and smiles and happy wonder.\n\n“Father, I had to come. And there are plenty more coming. And here is\nmy other self--the best fellow that ever lived: Darius Grant. ‘Dare’\nwe call him, father, for there is not anything he won’t venture if he\nthinks it worth the winning. And how is mi madre and Antonia, and Iza?\nAnd isn’t it jolly to see you with a rifle?”\n\n“Well, Dare; well, Jack; you are both welcome; never so welcome to Texas\nas at this hour. Come home at once and, refresh yourselves.”\n\nThere was so much to tell that at first the conversation was in\nfragments and exclamations, and the voices of the two young men, pitched\nhigh and clear in their excitement, went far before them as if impatient\nof their welcome. Antonia heard them first. She was on the balcony,\nstanding thoughtful and attent. It seemed to her as if in those days she\nwas always listening. Jack’s voice was the loudest, but she heard Dare’s\nfirst. It vibrated in midair and fell upon her consciousness, clear and\nsweet as a far-away bell.\n\n“That is Dare’s voice--HERE.”\n\nShe leaned forward, her soul hearkened after the vibrations, and again\nthey called her. With swift steps she reached the open door. Rachela sat\nin her chair within it.\n\n“The Senorita had better remain within,” she said, sullenly; “the sun\ngrows hot.”\n\n“Let me pass, Rachela, I am in a hurry.”\n\n“To be sure, the Senorita will have her way--good or bad.”\n\nAntonia heeded her not; she was hastening down the main avenue toward\nthe gateway. This avenue was hedged on each side with oleanders, and\nthey met in a light, waving arch above her head. At this season they\nwere one mass of pale pink blossoms and dark glossy leaves. The vivid\nsunshine through them made a rosy light which tinged her face and her\nwhite gown with an indescribable glow. If a mortal woman can ever look\nlike an angel, the fair, swiftly moving Antonia had at that moment the\nangelic expression of joy and love; the angelic unconsciousness of rapid\nand graceful movement; the angelic atmosphere that was in itself a dream\nof paradise; rose-tinted, divinely sweet and warm.\n\nDare saw her coming, and suddenly ceased speaking{.??} He was in the\nmidst of a sentence, but he forgot what he was saying. He forgot where\nhe was. He knew nothing, felt nothing, saw nothing, heard nothing but\nAntonia. And yet he did not fall at her feet, and kiss her hands and\nwhisper delightful extravagances; all of which things an Iberian lover\nwould have done, and felt and looked in the doing perfectly graceful and\nnatural.\n\nDare Grant only clasped both the pretty hands held out to him; only\nsaid “Antonia! Antonia!” only looked at her with eyes full of a loving\nquestion, which found its instant answer in her own. In that moment they\nrevealed to each other the length and breadth, the height and the depth\nof their affection. They had not thought of disguising it; they made no\nattempt to do so; and Robert Worth needed not the confession which, a\nfew hours later, Grant thought it right to make to him.\n\nWhen they entered the house together, a happy, noisy group, Rachela had\nleft her chair and was going hurriedly upstairs to tell the Senora her\nsurmise; but Jack passed her with a bound, and was at his mother’s side\nbefore the heavy old woman had comprehended his passing salutation.\n\n“Madre! Mother, I am here!”\n\nThe Senora was on her couch in her darkened room. She had been at the\nvery earliest mass, had a headache, and had come home in a state of\nrebellion against heaven and earth. But Jack was her idol, the one child\nfor whose presence she continually pined, the one human creature to\nwhose will and happiness she delighted to sacrifice her own. When she\nheard his voice she rose quickly, crying out:\n\n“A miracle! A miracle! Grace of God and Mary, a miracle! Only this\nmorning, my precious, my boy! I asked the Holy Mother to pity my\nsorrows, and send you to me. I vow to Mary a new shrine. I vow to keep\nit, and dress it for one whole year. I will give my opal ring to the\npoor. Oh, Juan! Juan! Juan I am too blessed.”\n\nHer words were broken into pieces by his kisses. He knelt at her knees,\nand stroked her face, and patted her hands, and did all with such\nnatural fervor and grace, that anything else, or anything less, must\nhave seemed cold and unfilial.\n\n“Come, my beautiful mother, and see my friend. I have told him so much\nabout you; and poor Dare has no mother. I have promised him that you\nwill be his mother also. Dare is so good--the finest fellow in all the\nworld; come down and see Dare, and let us have a real Mexican dinner,\nmadre. I have not tasted an olla since I left you.”\n\nShe could not resist him. She made Rachela lay out her prettiest dress,\nand when Jack said “how beautiful your hair is, mother; no one has hair\nlike you!” she drew out the great shell pins, and let it fall like a\ncloud around her, and with a glad pride gave Rachela the order to get\nout her jewelled comb and gilded fan and finest mantilla. And oh! how\nhappy is that mother who has such pure and fervent admiration from her\nson; and how happy is that son to whom his mother is ever beautiful!\n\nJack’s presence drove all the evil spirits out of the house. The windows\nwere thrown open; the sunshine came in. He was running after Isabel, he\nwas playing the mandolin; his voice, his laugh, his quick footstep, were\neverywhere.\n\nIn spite of the trouble in the city, there was a real festival in\nthe house. The Senora came down in her sweetest temper and her finest\ngarments. She arranged Jack’s dinner herself, selected the dishes and\ngave strict orders about their serving. She took Jack’s friend at once\ninto her favor, and Dare thought her wonderfully lovely and gracious. He\nsat with her on the balcony, and talked of Jack, telling her how clever\nhe was, and how all his comrades loved him for his sunny temper and\naffectionate heart.\n\nIt was a happy dinner, lengthened out with merry conversation. Every one\nthought that a few hours might be given to family love and family joy.\nIt would be good to have the memory of them in the days that were fast\ncoming. So they sat long over the sweetmeats, and fresh figs, and\nthe pale wines of Xeres and Alicante. And they rose up with laughter,\nlooking into each others’ faces with eyes that seemed to bespeak love\nand remembrance. And then they went from the table, and saw not Destiny\nstanding cold and pitiless behind them, marking two places for evermore\nvacant.\n\nThere was not much siesta that day. The Senora, Isabel and Jack\nsat together; the Senora dozed a little, but not enough to lose\nconsciousness of Jack’s presence and Jack’s voice. The father, happy,\nand yet acutely anxious, went to and fro between his children and his\nstudy. Antonia and Dare were in the myrtle walk or under the fig-tree.\nThis hour was the blossoming time of their lives. And it was not the\nless sweet and tender because of the dark shadows on the edge of the\nsunshine. Nor were they afraid to face the shadows, to inquire of them,\nand thus to taste the deeper rapture of love when love is gemmed with\ntears.\n\nIt was understood that the young men were going away in the morning very\nearly; so early that their adieus must be said with their good-nights.\nIt was at this hour that the Senora found courage to ask:\n\n“My Juan, where do you go?\n\n“To Gonzales, mi madre.”\n\n“But why? Oh, Juan, do not desert your madre, and your country!\n\n“Desert you, madre! I am your boy to my last breath! My country I love\nwith my whole soul. That is why I have come back to you and to her! She\nis in trouble and her sons must stand by her.”\n\n“Do not talk with two meanings. Oh, Juan! why do you go to Gonzales?”\n\n“We have heard that Colonel Ugartchea is to be there soon, and to\ntake away the arms of the Americans. That is not to be endured. If you\nyourself were a man, you would have been away ere this to help them, I\nam sure.”\n\n“ME!! The Blessed Virgin knows I would cut off my hands and feet first.\nJuan, listen to me dear one! You are a Mexican.”\n\n“My heart is Mexican, for it is yours. But I must stand with my father\nand with my brother, and with my American compatriots. Are we slaves,\nthat we must give up our arms? No, but if we gave them up we should\ndeserve to be slaves.”\n\n“God and the saints!” she answered, passionately. “What a trouble about\na few guns! One would think the Mexicans wanted the wives and children,\nthe homes and lands of the Americans. They cry out from one end of Texas\nto the other.”\n\n“They cry out in old England and in New England, in New York, in New\nOrleans, and all down the Mississippi. And men are crying back to\nthem: ‘Stand to your rifles and we will come and help you!’ The idea of\ndisarming ten thousand Americans!” Jack laughed with scornful amusement\nat the notion. “What a game it will be! Mother, you can’t tell how a\nman gets to love his rifle. He that takes our purse takes trash; but our\nrifles! By George Washington, that’s a different story!”\n\nJuan, my darling, you are my last hope. Your brother was born with an\nAmerican heart. He has even become a heretic. Fray Ignatius says he went\ninto the Colorado and was what they call immersed; he that was baptized\nwith holy water by the thrice holy bishop of Durango. My beloved one, go\nand see Fray Ignatius; late as it is, he will rise and counsel you.\n\n“My heart, my conscience, my country, my father, my brother, Santa\nAnna’s despotism, have already counselled me.”\n\n“Speak no more. I see that you also are a rebel and a heretic. Mother of\nsorrows, give me thy compassion!” Then, turning to Juan, she cried out:\n“May God pardon me for having brought into this world such ingrates! Go\nfrom me! You have broken my heart!”\n\nHe fell at her feet, and, in spite of her reluctance, took her hands--\n\n“Sweetest mother, wait but a little while. You will see that we are\nright. Do not be cross with Juan. I am going away. Kiss me, mother. Kiss\nme, and give me your blessing.”\n\n“No, I will not bless you. I will not kiss you. You want what is\nimpossible, what is wicked.”\n\n“I want freedom.”\n\n“And to get freedom you tread upon your mother’s heart. Let loose my\nhands. I am weary to death of this everlasting talk of freedom. I think\nindeed that the Americans know but two words: freedom and dollars. Ring\nfor Rachela. She, at least, is faithful to me.”\n\n“Not till you kiss me, mother. Do not send me away unblessed and\nunloved. That is to doom me to misfortune. Mi madre, I beg this favor\nfrom you.” He had risen, but he still held her hands, and he was weeping\nas innocent young men are not ashamed to weep.\n\nIf she had looked at him! Oh, if she had but once looked at his face,\nshe could not have resisted its beauty, its sorrow, its imploration! But\nshe would not look. She drew her hands angrily away from him. She turned\nher back upon her suppliant son and imperiously summoned Rachela.\n\n“Good-by, mi madre.”\n\n“Good-by, mi madre!”\n\nShe would not turn to him, or answer him a word.\n\n“Mi madre, here comes Rachela! Say ‘God bless you, Juan.’ It is my last\nword, sweet mother!”\n\nShe neither moved nor spoke. The next moment Rachela entered, and the\nwretched woman abandoned herself to her care with vehement sobs and\ncomplainings.\n\nJack was inexpressibly sorrowful. He went into the garden, hoping in its\nsilence and solitude to find some relief. He loved his mother with his\nstrongest affection. Every one of her sobs wrung his heart. Was it right\nto wound and disobey her for the sake of--freedom? Mother was a certain\ngood; freedom only a glorious promise. Mother was a living fact; freedom\nan intangible idea.\n\nAh, but men have always fought more passionately for ideas than for\nfacts! Tyrants are safe while they touch only silver and gold; but when\nthey try to bind a man’s ideals--the freedom of his citizenship--the\npurity of his faith--he will die to preserve them in their integrity.\n\nBesides, freedom for every generation has but her hour. If that hour is\nnot seized, no other may come for the men who have suffered it to pass.\nBut mother would grow more loving as the days went by. And this was ever\nthe end of Jack’s reasoning; for no man knows how deep the roots of his\nnature strike into his native land, until he sees her in the grasp of a\ntyrant, and hears her crying to him for deliverance.\n\nThe struggle left the impress on his face. He passed a boundary in it.\nCertain boyish feelings and graces would never again be possible to him.\nHe went into the house, weary, and longing for companionship that would\ncomfort or strengthen him. Only Isabel was in the parlor. She appeared\nto be asleep among the sofa cushions, but she opened her eyes wide as he\ntook a chair beside her.\n\n“I have been waiting to kiss you again, Juan; do you think this trouble\nwill last very long?”\n\n“It will be over directly, Iza. Do not fret yourself about it, angel\nmio. The Americans are great fighters, and their quarrel is just. Well,\nthen, it will be settled by the good God quickly.”\n\n“Rachela says that Santa Anna has sent off a million of men to fight the\nAmericans. Some they will cut in pieces, and some are to be sent to the\nmines to work in chains.”\n\n“God is not dead of old age, Iza. Santa Anna is a miraculous tyrant. He\nhas committed every crime under heaven, but I think he will not cut the\nAmericans in pieces.”\n\n“And if the Americans should even make him go back to Mexico!”\n\n“I think that is very possible.”\n\n“What then, Juan?”\n\n“He would pay for some of his crimes here the rest he would settle for\nin purgatory. And you, too, Iza, are you with the Americans?”\n\n“Luis Alveda says they are right.”\n\n“Oh-h! I see! So Luis is to be my brother too. Is that so, little dear?”\n\n“Have you room in your heart for him? Or has this Dare Grant filled it?”\n\n“If I had twenty sisters, I should have room for twenty brothers, if\nthey were like Dare and Luis. But, indeed, Luis had his place there\nbefore I knew Dare.”\n\n“And perhaps you may see him soon; he is with Senor Sam Houston. Senor\nHouston was here not a week ago. Will you think of that? And the mother\nand uncle of Luis are angry at him; he will be disinherited, and we\nshall be very poor, I think. But there is always my father, who loves\nLuis.”\n\n“Luis will win his own inheritance. I think you will be very rich.”\n\n“And, Juan, if you see Luis, say to him, ‘Iza thinks of you\ncontinually.’”\n\nAt this moment Rachela angrily called her charge--\n\n“Are you totally and forever wicked, disobedient one? Two hours I have\nbeen kept waiting. Very well! The Sisters are the only duenna for you;\nand back to the convent you shall go to-morrow. The Senora is of my\nmind, also.”\n\n“My father will not permit it. I will go to my father. And think of\nthis, Rachela: I am no longer to be treated like a baby.” But she kissed\nJuan ‘farewell,’ and went away without further dispute.\n\nThe handsome room looked strangely lonely and desolate when the door had\nclosed behind her. Jack rose, and roughly shook himself, as if by that\nmeans he hoped to throw off the oppression and melancholy that was\ninvading even his light heart. Hundreds of moths were dashing themselves\nto death against the high glass shade that covered the blowing candles\nfrom them. He stood and looked at their hopeless efforts to reach the\nflame. He had an unpleasant thought; one of those thoughts which have\nthe force of a presentiment. He put it away with annoyance, muttering,\n“It is time enough to meet misfortune when it comes.”\n\nThe sound of a footstep made him stand erect and face the door.\n\nIt was only a sleepy peon with a request that he would go to his\nfather’s study. A different mental atmosphere met him there. The doctor\nwas walking up and down the room, and Dare and Antonia sat together at\nthe open window.\n\n“Your father wants to hear about our journey, Jack. Take my chair and\ntell him what happened. Antonia and I will walk within hearing; a roof\nmakes me restless such a night as this”; for the waning moon had risen,\nand the cool wind from the Gulf was shaking a thousand scents from the\ntrees and the flowering shrubs.\n\nThe change was made with the words, and the doctor sat down beside his\nson. “I was asking, Jack, how you knew so much about Texan affairs, and\nhow you came so suddenly to take part in them?”\n\n“Indeed, father, we could not escape knowing. The Texan fever was more\nor less in every young man’s blood. One night Dare had a supper at his\nrooms, and there were thirty of us present. A man called Faulkner--a\nfine fellow from Nacogdoches--spoke to us. How do you think he spoke,\nwhen his only brother, a lad of twenty, is working in a Mexican mine\nloaded with chains?”\n\n“For what?”\n\n“He said one day that ‘the natural boundaries of the United States\nare the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.’ He was sent to the mines for the\nwords. Faulkner’s only hope for him is in the independence of Texas.\nHe had us on fire in five minutes--all but Sandy McDonald, who loves to\nargue, and therefore took the Mexican side.”\n\n“What could he say for it?”\n\n“He said it was a very unjustlike thing to make Mexico give her American\nsettlers in Texas two hundred and twenty-four millions of acres because\nshe thought a change of government best for her own interests.”\n\n“The Americans settled in Texas under the solemn guarantee of the\nconstitution of eighteen twenty-four. How many of them would have built\nhomes under a tyrannical despotism like that Santa Anna is now forcing\nupon them?” asked the doctor, warmly.\n\n“McDonald said, ‘There is a deal of talk about freedom among you\nAmericans, and it just means nothing at all.’ You should have seen\nFaulkner! He turned on him like a tornado. ‘How should you know anything\nabout freedom, McDonald?’ he cried. ‘You are in feudal darkness in the\nHighlands of Scotland. You have only just emigrated into freedom. But\nwe Americans are born free! If you can not feel the difference between\na federal constitution and a military and religious despotism, there is\nsimply no use talking to you. How would you like to find yourself in a\ncountry where suddenly trial by jury and the exercise of your religion\nwas denied you? Of course you could abandon the home you had built, and\nthe acres you had bought and put under cultivation, and thus make some\nMexican heir to your ten years’ labor. Perhaps a Scot, for conscience’\nsake, would do this.’”\n\n“And what answer made he? He said, ‘A Scot kens how to grip tight to\nten years’ labor as well as yoursel’, Faulkner; and neither man nor\nde’il can come between him and his religion; but--’ ‘BUT,’ shouted\nFaulkner; ‘there is no BUT! It is God and our right! God and our right,\nagainst priestcraft and despotism!’”\n\n“Then every one of us leaped to our feet, and we swore to follow\nFaulkner to Texas at an hour’s notice; and Sandy said we were ‘a parcel\nof fools’; and then, would you believe it, father, when our boat was\nleaving the pier, amid the cheers and hurrahs of thousands, Sandy leaped\non the boat and joined us?”\n\n“What did he say then?”\n\n“He said, ‘I am a born fool to go with you, but I think there is a kind\no’ witchcraft in that word TEXAS. It has been stirring me up morning and\nnight like the voice o’ the charmer, and I be to follow it though I ken\nwell enough it isna leading me in the paths o’ peace and pleasantness!’”\n\n“Did you find the same enthusiasm outside of New York?”\n\n“All along the Ohio and Mississippi we gathered recruits; and at\nRandolph, sixty miles above Memphis, we were joined by David Crockett.”\n\n“Jack!”\n\n“True, father! And then at every landing we took on men. For at every\nlanding Crockett spoke to the people; and, as we stopped very often, we\nwere cheered all the way down the river. The Mediterranean, though the\nbiggest boat on it, was soon crowded; but at Helena, Crockett and a\ngreat number of the leading men of the expedition got off. And as Dare\nand Crockett had become friends, I followed them.”\n\n“Where did you go to?”\n\n“We went ostensibly to a big barbecue at John Bowie’s plantation, which\nis a few miles below Helena. Invitations to this barbecue had been sent\nhundreds of miles throughout the surrounding country. We met parties\nfrom the depths of the Arkansas wilderness and the furthest boundaries\nof the Choctaw nation coming to it. There were raftsmen from the\nMississippi, from the White, and the St. Francis rivers. There were\nplanters from Lousiana and Tennessee. There were woodsmen from Kentucky.\nThere were envoys from New Orleans, Washington, and all the great\nEastern cities.”\n\n“I had an invitation myself, Jack.”\n\n“I wish you had accepted it. It was worth the journey. There never was\nand there never will be such a barbecue again. Thousands were present.\nThe woods were full of sheds and temporary buildings, and platforms for\nthe speakers.”\n\n“Who were the speakers?”\n\n“Crockett, Hawkins, General Montgomery, Colonel Beauford, the three\nbrothers Cheatham, Doc. Bennet, and many others. When the woods were\nilluminated at night with pine knots, you may imagine the scene and the\nwild enthusiasm that followed their eloquence.”\n\n“Doc. Bennet is a good partisan, and he is enormously rich.”\n\n“And he has a personal reason for his hatred of Mexico. An insatiable\nrevenge possesses him. His wife and two children were barbarously\nmurdered by Mexicans. He appealed to those who could not go to the\nfight to give money to aid it, and on the spot laid down ten thousand\ndollars.”\n\n“Good!”\n\n“Nine other men, either present or there by proxy, instantly gave a like\nsum, and thirty thousand in smaller sums was added to it. Every donation\nwas hailed with the wildest transports, and while the woods were ringing\nwith electrifying shouts, Hawkins rallied three hundred men round him\nand went off at a swinging galop for the Brazos.”\n\n“Oh, Jack! Jack!”\n\nIn another hour, the rest of the leaders had gathered their detachments,\nand every man had turned his face to the Texan prairies. Crockett was\nalready far advanced on the way. Sam Houston was known to be kindling\nthe fire on the spot; “and I suppose you know, father,” said Jack,\nsinking his voice to a whisper, “that we have still more powerful\nbackers.”\n\n“General Gaines?”\n\n“Well, he has a large body of United States troops at Nacogdoches. He\nsays they are to protect the people of Navasola from the Indians.”\n\n“But Navasola is twenty-nine miles west of Nacogdoches.”\n\n“Navasola is in Texas. Very well! If the United States feel it to be\ntheir duty to protect the people of Navasola, it seems they already\nconsider Texas within their boundary.”\n\n“You think the Indians a mere pretext?”\n\n“Of course. Crockett has with him an autograph letter from President\nJackson, introducing him as ‘a God-chosen patriot.’ President Jackson\nalready sees Texas in the Union, and Gaines understands that if the\nAmerican-Texans should be repulsed by Santa Anna, and fall back upon\nhim, that he may then gather them under his standard and lead them\nforward to victory--and the conquest of Texas. Father, you will see the\nStars and Stripes on the palaces of Mexico.”\n\n“Do not talk too fast, Jack. And now, go lie down on my bed. In four\nhours you must leave, if you want to reach Gonzales to-night!”\n\nThen Dare was called, and the lovers knew that their hour of parting was\ncome. They said nothing of the fears in their hearts; and on Antonia’s\nlifted face there was only the light of love and of hope.\n\n“The fight will soon be over, darling, and then!”\n\n“And then? We shall be so happy.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. ROBERT WORTH IS DISARMED.\n\n\n     “Strange sons of Mexico, and strange her fate;\n      They fight for freedom who were never free;\n      A kingless people for a nerveless state.”\n\n     *   *   *   *   *\n\n     “Not all the threats or favors of a crown,\n      A Prince’s whisper, or a tyrant’s frown,\n      Can awe the spirit or allure the mind\n      Of him, who to strict Honor is inclined.\n      Though all the pomp and pleasure that does wait\n      On public places, and affairs of state;\n      Though all the storms and tempests should arise,\n      That Church magicians in their cells devise,\n      And from their settled basis nations tear:\n      He would, unmoved, the mighty ruin bear.\n      Secure in innocence, contemn them all,\n      And, decently arrayed, in honor fall.”\n\n     *   *   *   *   *\n\n     “Say, what is honor?  ‘Tis the finest sense\n      Of justice which the human mind can frame.”\n\n\nThe keenest sufferings entailed by war are not on the battle-field,\nnor in the hospital. They are in the household. There are the maimed\naffections, the slain hopes, the broken ties of love. And before a shot\nhad been fired in the war of Texan independence, the battle had begun in\nRobert Worth’s household.\n\nThe young men lay down to rest, but he sat watching the night away.\nThere was a melancholy sleepiness in it; the mockingbirds had ceased\nsinging; the chirping insects had become weary. Only the clock, with its\nregular “tick, tick,” kept the watch with him.\n\nWhen it was near dawn, he lifted a candle and went into the room where\nJack and Dare were sleeping. Dare did not move; Jack opened his eyes\nwide, and smiled brightly at the intruder.\n\n“Well, father?”\n\n“It is time to get up, Jack. Tell Dare.”\n\nIn a few minutes both came to him. A bottle of wine, some preserved\nbears’ paws, and biscuits were on the table. They ate standing, speaking\nvery little and almost in whispers; and then the doctor went with\nthem to the stable. He helped Jack to saddle his horse. He found a sad\npleasure in coming so close to him. Once their cheeks touched, and the\ntouch brought the tears to his eyes and sent he blood to his heart.\n\nWith his hand on the saddle, Jack paused and said, softly, “Father,\ndear, tell mi madre my last look at the house, my last thought in\nleaving it, was for her. She would not kiss me or bless me last night.\nAsk her to kiss you for me,” and then the lad broke fairly down. The\nmoment had come in which love could find no utterance, and must act. He\nflung his arm around his father’s neck and kissed him. And the father\nwept also, and yet spoke brave words to both as he walked with them\nto the gate and watched them ride into the thick mist lying upon the\nprairie like a cloud. They were only darker spots in it. It swallowed\nthem up. They were lost to sight.\n\nHe thought no one had seen the boys leave but himself. But through the\nlattices two sorrowful women also watched their departure. The Senora,\nas wakeful as her husband, had heard the slight movements, the unusual\nnoises of that early hour, and had divined the cause of them. She looked\nat Rachela. The woman had fallen into the dead sleep of exhaustion, and\nshe would not have to parry her objections and warnings. Unshod, and\nin her night-dress, she slipped through the corridor to the back of the\nhouse, and tightly clasping her rosary in her hands, she stood behind\nthe lattice and watched her boy away.\n\nHe turned in his saddle just before he passed the gate, and she saw his\nyoung face lifted with an unconscious, anxious love, to the very lattice\nat which she stood: In the dim light it had a strange pallor. The misty\nair blurred and made all indistinct. It was like seeing her Jack in some\nwoful dream. If he had been dead, such a vision of him might have come\nto her from the shadow land.\n\nUsually her grief was noisy and imperative of sympathy. But this morning\nshe could not cry nor lament. She went softly back to her room and sat\ndown, with her crucifix before her aching eyes. Yet she could not\nsay her usual prayers. She could not remember anything but Jack’s\nentreaty--“Kiss me, mi madre! Bless me, mi madre!” She could not see\nanything but that last rapid turn in the saddle, and that piteous young\nface, showing so weird and dreamlike through the gray mist of the early\ndawn.\n\nAntonia had watched with her. Dare, also, had turned, but there had\nbeen something about Dare’s attitude far more cheery and hopeful. On the\nprevious night Antonia had put some sprays of rosemary in his hat band\n“to bring good, and keep away evil on a journey”; and as he turned and\nlifted his hat he put his lips to them. He had the belief that from some\npoint his Antonia was watching him. He conveyed to her, by the strength\nof his love and his will, the assurance of all their hopes.\n\nThat day Doctor Worth did not go out. The little bravado of carrying\narms was impossible to him. It was not that his courage had failed, or\nthat he had lost a tittle of his convictions, but he was depressed\nby the uncertainty of his position and duty, and he was, besides, the\nthrall of that intangible anxiety which we call PRESENTIMENT.\n\nYet, however dreary life is, it must go on. The brave-hearted cannot\ndrop daily duty. On the second day the doctor went to his office again,\nand Antonia arranged the meals and received company, and did her best\nto bring the household into peaceful accord with the new elements\nencroaching on it from all sides.\n\nBut the Senora was more “difficult” than even Rachela had ever seen her\nbefore. She did not go to church, but Fray Ignatius spent a great deal\nof time with her; and his influence was not any more conciliating than\nthat of early masses and much fasting.\n\nHe said to her, indeed: “My daughter, you have behaved with the\nfortitude of a saint. It would have been more than a venial sin, if you\nhad kissed and blessed a rebel in the very act of his rebellion. The\nHoly Mary will reward and comfort you.”\n\nBut the Senora was not sensible of the reward and comfort; and she did\nfeel most acutely the cruel wound she had given her mother love. Neither\nprayers nor penance availed her. She wanted to see Jack. She wanted to\nkiss him a hundred times, and bless him with every kiss. And it did not\nhelp her to be told that these longings were the suggestions of the Evil\nOne, and not to be listened to.\n\nThe black-robed monk, gliding about his house with downcast eyes and\nfolded hands, had never seemed to Robert Worth so objectionable. He\nknew that he kept the breach open between himself and his wife--that\nhe thought it a point of religious duty to do so. He knew that he was\ngradually isolating the wretched woman from her husband and children,\nand that the continual repetition of prayers and penances did not give\nher any adequate comfort for the wrong she was doing her affections.\n\nThe city was also in a condition of the greatest excitement. The\nsoldiers in the Alamo were under arms. Their officers had evidently\nreceived important advices from Mexico. General Cos, the brother-in-law\nof Santa Anna, was now in command, and it was said immense\nreinforcements were hourly looked for. The drifting American population\nhad entirely vanished, but its palpable absence inspired the most\nthoughtful of the people with fear instead of security.\n\nNor were the military by any means sure of the loyalty of the city. It\nwas well known that a large proportion of the best citizens hated the\ndespotism of Santa Anna; and that if the Americans attacked San\nAntonio, they would receive active sympathy. Party feeling was no\nlonger controllable. Men suspected each other. Duels were of constant\noccurrence, and families were torn to pieces; for the monks supported\nSanta Anna with all their influence, and there were few women who dared\nto disobey them.\n\nInto the midst of this turbulent, touchy community, there fell one\nmorning a word or two which set it on fire. Doctor Worth was talking on\nthe Plaza with Senor Lopez Navarro. A Mexican soldier, with his yellow\ncloak streaming out behind him, galloped madly towards the Alamo and\nleft the news there. It spread like wildfire. “There had been a fight at\nGonzales, and the Americans had kept their arms. They had also put the\nMexicans to flight.”\n\n“And more,” added a young Mexican coming up to the group of which Robert\nWorth was one, “Stephen Austin has escaped, and he arrived at Gonzales\nat the very moment of victory. And more yet: Americans are pouring into\nGonzales from every quarter.”\n\nAn officer tapped Doctor Worth on the shoulder. “Senor Doctor, your\narms. General Cos hopes, in the present extremity, you will set an\nexample of obedience.”\n\n“I will not give up my arms. In the present extremity my arms are the\ngreatest need I have.”\n\n“Then Senor,--it is a great affliction to me--I must arrest you.”\n\nHe was led away, amid the audible murmurs of the men who filled the\nstreets. There needed but some one to have said the word, and they would\nhave taken him forcibly from the military. A great crowd followed him to\nthe gates of the Alamo. For there was scarcely a family in San Antonio\nof which this good doctor was not an adopted member. The arrest of their\nfavorite confessor would hardly have enraged them more.\n\nFray Ignatius brought the news to the Senora. Even he was affected by\nit. Never before had Antonia seen him walk except with thoughtful and\ndeliberate steps. She wondered at his appearance; at its suppressed\nhurry; at a something in it which struck her as suppressed satisfaction.\n\nAnd the priest was in his heart satisfied; though he was consciously\ntelling himself that “he was sorry for the Senora, and that he would\nhave been glad if the sins of her husband could have been set against\nthe works of supererogation which the saints of his own convent had\namassed.”\n\n“But he is an infidel; he believes not in the saints,” he muttered;\n“then how could they avail him!”\n\nAntonia met him at the door. He said an Ave Maria as he crossed the\nthreshold, and gave her his hand to kiss. She looked wonderingly in his\nface, for unless it was a special visit, he never called so near the\nAngelus. Still, it is difficult to throw off a habit of obedience formed\nin early youth; and she did not feel as if she could break through the\nchill atmosphere of the man and ask: “For what reason have you come,\nfather?”\n\nA long, shrill shriek from the Senora was the first answer to the\nfearful question in her heart. In a few moments she was at her mother’s\ndoor. Rachela knelt outside it, telling her rosary. She stolidly\nkept her place, and a certain instinct for a moment prevented Antonia\ninterrupting her. But the passionate words of her mother, blending with\nthe low, measured tones of the priest, were something far more positive.\n\n“Let me pass you, Rachela. What is the matter with my mother?”\n\nThe woman was absorbed in her supplications, and Antonia opened the\ndoor. Isabel followed her. They found themselves in the the{sic}\npresence of an angry sorrow that appalled them. The Senora had torn her\nlace mantilla into shreds, and they were scattered over the room as she\nhad flung them from her hands in her frantic walk about it. The large\nshell comb that confined her hair was trodden to pieces, and its long\ncoils had fallen about her face and shoulders. Her bracelets, her chain\nof gold, her brooch and rings were scattered on the floor, and she was\nstanding in the centre of it, like an enraged creature; tearing\nher handkerchief into strips, as an emphasis to her passionate\ndenunciations.\n\n“It serves him right! JESUS! MARIA! JOSEPH! It serves him right! He must\ncarry arms! HE, TOO! when it was forbidden! I am glad he is arrested!\nOh, Roberto! Roberto!”\n\n“Patience, my daughter! This is the hand of God. What can you do but\nsubmit?”\n\n“What is it, mi madre?” and Isabel put her arms around her mother with\nthe words mi madre. “Tell Isabel your sorrow.”\n\n“Your father is arrested--taken to the Alamo--he will be sent to the\nmines. I told him so! I told him so! He would not listen to me! How\nwicked he has been!”\n\n“What has my father done, Fray Ignatius? Why have they arrested him?”\n\nThe priest turned to Antonia with a cold face. He did not like her. He\nfelt that she did not believe in him.\n\n“Senorita, he has committed a treason. A good citizen obeys the law;\nSenor Worth has defied it.”\n\n“Pardon, father, I cannot believe it.”\n\n“A great forbearance has been shown him, but the end of mercy comes.\nAs he persisted in wearing arms, he has been taken to the Alamo and\ndisarmed.”\n\n“It is a great shame! An infamous shame and wrong!” cried Antonia. “What\nright has any one to take my father’s arms? No more than they have to\ntake his purse or his coat.”\n\n“General Santa Anna--”\n\n“General Santa Anna is a tyrant and a thief. I care not who says\ndifferent.”\n\n“Antonia! Shameless one!”\n\n“Mother, do not strike me.” Then she took her mother’s hands in her own,\nand led her to a couch, caressing her as she spoke--\n\n“Don’t believe any one--ANY ONE, mother, who says wrong of my father.\nYou know that he is the best of men. Rachela! Come here instantly. The\nrosary is not the thing, now. You ought to be attending to the Senora.\nGet her some valerian and some coffee, and come and remove her clothing.\nFray Ignatius, we will beg you to leave us to-night to ourselves.”\n\n“Your mother’s sin, in marrying a heretic, has now found her out. It is\nmy duty to make her see her fault.”\n\n“My mother had a dispensation from one greater than you.”\n\n“Oh, father, pray for me! I accuse myself! I accuse myself! Oh, wretched\nwoman! Oh, cruel husband!”\n\n“Mother, you have been a very happy woman. You have had the best husband\nin the world. Do not reproach my father for the sins of others. Do not\ndesert him when he is in the power of a human tiger. My God, mother! let\nus think of something to be done for his help! I will see the Navarros,\nthe Garcias, Judge Valdez; I will go to the Plaza and call on the\nthousands he has cured and helped to set him free.”\n\n“You will make of yourself something not to be spoken of. This is the\njudgment of God, my daughter.”\n\n“It is the judgment of a wicked man, Fray Ignatius. My mother is not now\nable to listen to you. Isabel, come here and comfort her.” Isabel put\nher cheek to her mother’s; she murmured caressing words; she kissed her\nface, and coiled up her straggling hair, and with childlike trust amid\nall, solicited Holy Mary to console them.\n\nFray Ignatius watched her with a cold scrutiny. He was saying to\nhimself, “It is the fruit of sin. I warned the Senora, when she married\nthis heretic, that trouble would come of it. Very well, it has come.”\n Then like a flash a new thought invaded his mind--If the Senor Doctor\ndisappeared forever, why not induce the Senora and her daughters to\ngo into a religious house? There was a great deal of money. The church\ncould use it well.\n\nAntonia did not understand the thought, but she understood its animus,\nand again she requested his withdrawal. This time she went close to him,\nand bravely looked straight into his eyes. Their scornful gleam sent\na chill to her heart like that of cold steel. At that moment she\nunderstood that she had turned a passive enemy into an active one.\n\nHe went, however, without further parley, stopping only to warn the\nSenora against the sin “of standing with the enemies of God and the\nHoly Church,” and to order Isabel to recite for her mother’s pardon and\ncomfort a certain number of aves and paternosters. Antonia went with\nhim to the door, and ere he left he blessed her, and said: “The Senorita\nwill examine her soul and see her sin. Then the ever merciful Church\nwill hear her confession, and give her the satisfying penance.”\n\nAntonia bowed in response. When people are in great domestic sorrow,\nself-examination is a superfluous advice. She listened a moment to\nhis departing footsteps, shivering as she stood in the darkness, for a\nnorther had sprung up, and the cold was severe. She only glanced into\nthe pleasant parlor where the table was laid for dinner, and a great\nfire of cedar logs was throwing red, dancing lights over the white linen\nand the shining silver and glass. The chairs were placed around\nthe table; her father’s at the head. It had a forsaken air that was\nunendurable.\n\nThe dinner hour was now long past. It would be folly to attempt the\nmeal. How could she and Isabel sit down alone and eat, and her father in\nprison, and her mother frantic with a loss which she was warned it was\nsinful to mourn over. Antonia had a soul made for extremities and not\nafraid to face them, but invisible hands controlled her. What could\na woman do, whom society had forbidden to do anything, but endure the\npangs of patience?\n\nThe Senora could offer no suggestions. She was not indeed in a mood to\nthink of her resources. A spiritual dread was upon her. And with this\nmingled an intense sense of personal wrong from her husband. “Had she\nnot begged him to be passive? And he had put an old rifle before her\nand her daughters! It was all that Senor Houston’s doing. She had an\nassurance of that.” She invoked a thousand maledictions on him. She\nrecalled, with passionate reproaches, Jack’s infidelity to her and\nhis God and his country. Her anger passed from one subject to another\nconstantly, finding in all, even in the lukewarmness of Antonia and\nIsabel, and in their affection for lovers, who were also rebels, an\naccumulating reason for a stupendous reproach against herself, her\nhusband, her children, and her unhappy fate. Her whole nature was in\nrevolt--in that complete mental and moral anarchy from which springs\ntragedy and murder.\n\nIsabel wept so violently that she angered still further the tearless\nsuffering of her mother. “God and the saints!” she cried. “What are you\nweeping for? Will tears do any good? Do I weep? God has forbidden me\nto weep for the wicked. Yet how I suffer! Mary, mother of sorrows, pity\nme!”\n\nShe sent Isabel away. Her sobs were not to be borne. And very soon\nshe felt Antonia’s white face and silent companionship to be just as\nunendurable. She would be alone. Not even Rachela would she have near\nher. She put out all the lights but the taper above a large crucifix,\nand at its foot she sat down in tearless abandon, alone with her\nreproaches and her remorse.\n\nAntonia watched with her mother, though shut out from her presence.\nShe feared for a state of mind so barren of affection, so unsoftened\nby tears. Besides, it was the climax of a condition which had continued\never since she had sent her boy away without a word of love. In the\ndim corridor outside she sat still, listening for any noise or movement\nwhich might demand help or sympathy. It was not nine o’clock; but the\ntime lengthened itself out beyond endurance. Even yet she had hope of\nsome word from her father. Surely, they would let him send some word to\nthem!\n\nShe heard the murmur of voices downstairs, and she thought angrily of\nRachela, and Molly, and Manuel, “making a little confidence together”\n over their trouble, and spicing their evening gossip with the strange\nthing that had happened to the Senor Doctor. She knew that Rachela and\nManuel would call him heretic and Americano, and, by authority of these\ntwo words, accuse him of every crime.\n\nThinking with a swelling heart of these things, she heard the door open,\nand a step slowly and heavily ascend the stairs. Ere she had time to\nwonder at it, her father came in sight. There was a shocking change in\nhis air and appearance, but as he was evidently going to her mother’s\nroom, she shrank back and sat motionless so as not to attract his\nattention.\n\nThen she went to the parlor, and had the fire renewed and food put upon\nthe table. She was sure that he would need it, and she believed he would\nbe glad to talk over with her the events of the afternoon.\n\nThe Senora was still sitting at the foot of the crucifix when her\nhusband opened the door. She had not been able to pray; ave and\npaternoster alike had failed her. Her rebellious grief filled every\ncorner of her heart. She understood that some one had entered the room,\nand she thought of Rachela; but she found a kind of comfort in the dull\nstupor of grief she was indulging, and she would not break its spell by\nlifting her head.\n\n“Maria.”\n\nShe rose up quickly and stood gazing at him.\n\nShe did not shriek or exclaim; her surprise controlled her. And also her\nterror; for his face was white as death, and had an expression of angry\ndespair that terrified her.\n\n“Roberto! Roberto! Mi Roberto! How you have tortured me! I have nearly\ndied! Fray Ignatius said you had been sent to prison.”\n\nShe spoke as calmly as a frightened child; sad and hesitating. If he had\ntaken her in his arms she would have sobbed her grief away there.\n\nBut Robert Worth was at that hour possessed by two master passions,\ntyrannical and insatiable--they would take notice of nothing that did\nnot minister to them.\n\n“Maria, they have taken my arms from me. Cowards! Cowards! Miserable\ncowards! I refused to give them up! They held my hands and robbed\nme--robbed me of my manhood and honor! I begged them to shoot me ere\nthey did it, and they spoke courteously and regretted this, and hoped\nthat, till I felt that it would be a joy to strangle them.”\n\n“Roberto! Mi Roberto! You have me!”\n\n“I want my rifle and all it represents. I want myself back again. Maria,\nMaria, until then, I am not worthy to be any good woman’s husband!”\n\n“Roberto, dearest! It is not your fault.”\n\n“It is my fault. I have waited too long. My sons showed me my duty--my\nsoul urged me to do it. I deserve the shame, but I will wipe it out with\ncrimson blood.”\n\nThe Senora stood speechless, wringing her hands. Her own passion was\npuny beside the sternness, the reality, and the intensity of the quiet\nrage before her. She was completely mastered by it. She forgot all but\nthe evident agony she could neither mistake nor console.\n\n“I have come to say ‘farewell,’ Maria. We have been very happy\ntogether--Maria--our children--dearest--”\n\n“Oh, Roberto! My husband! My soul! My life! Leave me not.”\n\n“I am going for my arms. I will take them a hundredfold from those who\nhave robbed me. I swear I will!”\n\n“You do not love me. What are these Americans to you? I am your wife.\nYour Maria--”\n\n“These Americans are my brothers--my sons. My mother is an American\nwoman.”\n\n“And I?”\n\n“You are my wife--my dear wife! I love you--God Almighty knows how well\nI love you; but we must part now, at least for a short time. Maria, my\ndear one, I must go.”\n\n“Go? Where to?”\n\n“I am going to join General Houston.”\n\n“I thought so. I knew it. The accursed one! Oh that I had him here\nagain! I would bury my stiletto in his heart! Over the white hilt\nI would bury it! I would wash my hands in his blood, and think them\nblessed ever afterwards! Stay till daylight, Roberto. I have so much to\nsay, dearest.”\n\n“I cannot. I have stayed too long. And now I must ride without a gun\nor knife to protect me. Any Indian that I meet can scalp me. Do you\nunderstand now what disarming means, Maria? If I had gone with my boy,\nwith my brave Jack, I could at least have sold my life to its last\ndrop.”\n\n“In the morning, Roberto, Lopez Navarro will get you a gun. Oh, if you\nmust go, do not go unarmed! There are ten thousand Comanche between here\nand the Brazos.”\n\n“How could I look Lopez Navarro in the face? Or any other man? No, no!\nI must win back my arms, before I can walk the streets of San Antonio\nagain.”\n\nHe took her in his arms, he kissed her eyes, her cheeks, her lips,\nmurmuring tender little Spanish words that meant, oh, so much, to the\nwretched woman!--words she had taught him with kisses--words he never\nused but to her ears only.\n\nShe clung to his neck, to his hands, to his feet; she made his farewell\nan unspeakable agony. At last he laid her upon her couch, sobbing and\nshrieking like a child in an extremity of physical anguish. But he did\nnot blame her. Her impetuosities, her unreasonable extravagances, were\na part of her nature, her race, and her character. He did not expect a\nweak, excitable woman to become suddenly a creature of flame and steel.\n\nBut it was a wonderful rest to his exhausted body and soul to turn from\nher to Antonia. She led him quietly to his chair by the parlor fire.\nShe gave him food and wine. She listened patiently, but with a living\nsympathy, to his wrong. She endorsed, with a clasp of his hand and a\nsmile, his purpose. And she said, almost cheerfully:\n\n“You have not given up all your arms, father. When I first heard of the\nedict, I hid in my own room the rifle, the powder and the shot, which\nwere in your study. Paola has knives in the stable; plenty of them. Get\none from him.”\n\nGood news is a very relative thing. This information made the doctor\nfeel as if all were now easy and possible. The words he said to her,\nAntonia never forgot. They sang in her heart like music, and led her on\nthrough many a difficult path. The conversation then turned upon money\nmatters, and Antonia received the key of his study, and full directions\nas to the gold and papers secreted there.\n\nThen Isabel was awakened, and the rifle brought down; and Paola saddled\nthe fleetest horse in the stable, and after one solemn five minutes with\nhis daughter, Robert Worth rode away into the midnight darkness, and\ninto a chaos of public events of which no man living could forecast the\noutcome.\n\nRode away from wife and children and home; leaving behind him the love\nand labor of his lifetime--\n\n        “The thousand sweet, still joys of such\n         As hand in hand face earthly life.”\n\nFor what? For justice, for freedom of thought and action, for the rights\nof his manhood, for the brotherhood of race and religion and country.\nAntonia and Isabel stood hand in hand at the same lattice from which the\nSenora had watched her son away, and in a dim, uncertain manner these\nthoughts connected themselves in each mind with the same mournful\ninquiry--Is it worth while?\n\nAs the beat of the horse’s hoofs died away, they turned. The night was\ncold but clear, and the sky appeared so high that their eyes throbbed\nas they gazed upward at the grand arch, sprinkled with suns and worlds.\nSuddenly into the tranquil spaces there was flung a sound of joy and\nrevelry; and the girls stepped to a lattice at the end of the corridor\nand looked out.\n\nThe residencia of Don Salvo Valasco was clearly visible from this site.\nThey saw that it was illuminated throughout. Lovely women, shining with\njewels, and soldiers in scarlet and gold, were chatting through the\ngraceful movements of the danza, or executing the more brilliant Jota\nAragonesa. The misty beauty of white lace mantillas, the glitter and\ncolor of fans and festival dresses, made a moving picture of great\nbeauty.\n\nAnd as they watched it there was a cessation of the dance, followed by\nthe rapid sweep of a powerful hand over the strings of a guitar. Then a\ngroup of officers stepped together, and a great wave of melodious song,\nsolemn and triumphant, thrilled the night. It was the national hymn.\nAntonia and Isabel knew it. Every word beat upon their hearts. The power\nof association, the charm of a stately, fervent melody was upon them.\n\n“It is Senor Higadillos who leads,” whispered Isabel, as a resonant\nvoice, powerful and sweet, cried--\n\n     “O list to the summons!  The blood of our sires,\n      Boils high in our veins, and to vengeance inspires!\n      Who bows to the yoke? who bends to the blow?”\n\nand, without a moment’s hesitation, the answer came in a chorus of\nenthusiastic cadences--\n\n     “No hero will bend, no Mexican bow;\n      Our country in tears sends her sons to the fight,\n      To conquer, or die, for our land and our right.”\n\n\n“You see, the Mexicans think THEY are in the right--THEY are patriots\nalso, Antonia.”\n\nThe sorrowful girl spoke like a puzzled child, fretfully and\nuncertainly, and Antonia led her silently away. What could she answer?\nAnd when she remembered the dear fugitive, riding alone through the\nmidnight--riding now for life and liberty--she could not help the\nuprising again of that cold benumbing question--“Is it worth while?”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. A MEETING AT MIDNIGHT.\n\n     “All faiths are to their own believers just,\n      For none believe because they will, but must;\n      The priest continues what the nurse began,\n      And thus the child imposes on the man.”\n                                  --DRYDEN.\n\n     “--if he be called upon to face\n      Some awful moment, to which heaven has joined\n      Great issues good or bad for humankind,\n      Is happy as a lover; and attired\n      With sudden brightness, like a man inspired;\n      And through the heat of conflict keeps the law\n      In calmness made; and sees what he foresaw,\n      Or, if an unexpected call succeed,\n      Come when it will, is equal to the need.”\n                                  --WORDSWORTH.\n\n     “Ah! love, let us be true\n      To one another, through the world which seems\n      To lie before us like a land of dreams!”\n\nThe gathering at Don Valasco’s was constantly repeated in various\ndegrees of splendor among the loyal Mexicans of the city. They were as\nfully convinced of the justice of their cause as the Americans were.\n“They had graciously permitted Americans to make homes in their country;\nnow they wanted not only to build heretic churches and sell heretic\nbibles, but also to govern Texas after their own fashion.” From a\nMexican point of view the American settlers were a godless, atheistical,\nquarrelsome set of ingrates. For eaten bread is soon forgotten, and\nMexicans disliked to remember that their own independence had been\nwon by the aid of the very men they were now trying to force into\nsubjection.\n\nThe two parties were already in array in every house in the city. The\nSenora at variance with her daughters, their Irish cook quarrelling\nwith their Mexican servants, only represented a state of things nearly\nuniversal. And after the failure of the Mexicans at Gonzales to disarm\nthe Americans, the animosity constantly increased.\n\nIn every church, the priests--more bitter, fierce and revengeful than\neither the civil or military power--urged on the people an exterminating\nwar. A black flag waved from the Missions, and fired every heart with\nan unrelenting vengeance and hatred. To slay a heretic was a free pass\nthrough the dolorous pains of purgatory. For the priesthood foresaw\nthat the triumph of the American element meant the triumph of freedom\nof conscience, and the abolition of their own despotism. To them the\nstruggle was one involving all the privileges of their order; and they\nurged on the fight with passionate denunciations of the foe, and with\nmagnificent promises of spiritual favors and blessings. In the fortress,\nthe plaza, the houses, the churches, the streets, their fiery words kept\nsociety in a ferment.\n\nBut through all this turmoil the small duties of life went on. Soldiers\nwere parading the streets, and keeping watch on the flat roofs of the\nhouses; men were solemly{sic} swearing allegiance to Santa Anna, or\nflying by night to the camp of the Americans; life and death were held\nat a pin’s fee; but eating and dressing, dancing and flirting were\npursued with an eagerness typical of pleasure caught in the passing.\n\nAnd every hour these elements gathered intensity. The always restless\npopulace of San Antonio was at a feverish point of impatience. They\nwanted the war at their own doors. They wanted the quarrel fought out on\ntheir own streets. Business took a secondary place. Men fingered weapons\nand dreamed of blood, until the temper of the town was as boisterous and\nvehement as the temper of the amphitheatre when impatiently waiting for\nthe bulls and the matadores.\n\nNor was it possible for Antonia to lock the door upon this pervading\nspirit. After Doctor Worth’s flight, it became necessary for her to\nassume control over the household. She had promised him to do so,\nand she was resolved, in spite of all opposition, to follow out his\ninstructions. But it was by no means an easy task.\n\nFray Ignatius had both the Senora and Rachela completely under his\nsubjection. Molly, the Irish cook, was already dissatisfied. The doctor\nhad saved her life and given her a good home and generous wages,\nand while the doctor was happy and prosperous Molly was accordingly\ngrateful. But a few words from the priest set affairs in a far\npleasanter light to her. She was a true Catholic; the saints sent the\nheretic doctor to help. It was therefore the saints to whom gratitude\nwas due. Had she not earned her good wage? And would not Don Angel\nSandoval give her a still larger sum? Or even the Brothers at the\nMission of San Jose? Molly listened to these words with a complacent\npleasure. She reflected that it would be much more agreeable to her to\nbe where she could entirely forget that she had ever been hungry and\nfriendless, and lying at death’s door.\n\nAntonia knew also that Rachela was at heart unfaithful, and soon the\nconviction was forced on her that servants are never faithful beyond the\nline of their own interest--that it is, indeed, against certain primary\nlaws of nature to expect it. Certainly, it was impossible to doubt\nthat there was in all their dependents a kind of satisfaction in their\nmisfortunes.\n\nThe doctor had done them favors--how unpleasant was their memory!\nThe Senora had offended them by the splendor of her dress, and her\ncomplacent air of happiness. Antonia’s American ways and her habit of\nsitting for hours with a book in her hand were a great irritation.\n\n“She wishes to be thought wiser than other women--as wise as even a holy\npriest--SHE! that never goes to mass, and is nearly a heretic,” said the\nhouse steward; “and as for the Senorita Isabel, a little trouble will be\ngood for her! Holy Mary! the way she has been pampered and petted! It\nis an absurdity. ‘Little dear,’ and ‘angel,’ are the hardest words she\nhears. Si! if God did not mercifully abate a little the rich they would\ngrow to be ‘almightys.’”\n\nThis was the tone of the conversation of the servants of the household.\nIt was not an unnatural tone, but it was a very unhappy one. People\ncannot escape from the mood of mind they habitually indulge, and from\nthe animus of the words they habitually use; and Antonia felt and\nunderstood the antagonistic atmosphere. For the things which we know\nbest of all are precisely the things which no one has ever told us.\n\nThe Senora, in a plain black serge gown, and black rebozo over her head,\nspent her time in prayers and penances. The care of her household had\nalways been delegated to her steward, and to Rachela; while the duties\nthat more especially belonged to her, had been fulfilled by her husband\nand by Antonia. In many respects she was but a grown-up baby. And so, in\nthis great extremity, the only duty which pressed upon her was the idea\nof supplicating the saints to take charge of her unhappy affairs.\n\nAnd Fray Ignatius was daily more hard with her. Antonia even suspected\nfrom his growing intolerance and bitterness, that the Americans\nwere gaining unexpected advantages. But she knew nothing of what was\nhappening. She could hear from afar off the marching and movements of\nsoldiers; the blare of military music; the faint echoes of hurrahing\nmultitudes; but there was no one to give her any certain information.\nStill, she guessed something from the anger of the priest and the\nreticence of the Mexican servants. If good fortune had been with\nSanta Anna, she was sure she would have heard of “The glorious! The\ninvincible! The magnificent Presidente de la Republica Mexicana! The\nNapoleon of the West!”\n\nIt was not permitted her to go into the city. A proposal to do so had\nbeen met with a storm of angry amazement. And steam and electricity\nhad not then annihilated distance and abolished suspense. She could but\nwonder and hope, and try to read the truth from a covert inspection of\nthe face and words of Fray Ignatius.\n\nBetween this monk and herself the breach was hourly widening. With angry\npain she saw her mother tortured between the fact that she loved her\nhusband, and the horrible doubt that to love him was a mortal sin. She\nunderstood the underlying motive which prompted the priest to urge upon\nthe Senora the removal of herself and her daughters to the convent.\nHis offer to take charge of the Worth residencia and estate was in her\nconviction a proposal to rob them of all rights in it. She felt certain\nthat whatever the Church once grasped in its iron hand, it would ever\nretain. And both to Isabel and herself the thought of a convent was now\nhorrible. “They will force me to be a nun,” said Isabel; “and then, what\nwill Luis do? And they will never tell me anything about my father and\nmy brothers. I should never hear of them. I should never see them any\nmore; unless the good God was so kind as to let me meet them in his\nheaven.”\n\nAnd Antonia had still darker and more fearful thoughts. She had not\nforgotten the stories whispered to her childhood, of dreadful fates\nreserved for contumacious and disobedient women. Whenever Fray\nIgnatius looked at her she felt as if she were within the shadow of the\nInquisition.\n\nNever had days passed so wearily and anxiously. Never had nights been so\nterrible. The sisters did not dare to talk much together; they doubted\nRachela; they were sure their words were listened to and repeated.\nThey were not permitted to be alone with the Senora. Fray Ignatius had\nparticularly warned Rachela to prevent this. He was gradually bringing\nthe unhappy woman into what he called “a heavenly mind”--the influence\nof her daughters, he was sure, would be that of worldly affections and\nsinful liberty. And Rachela obeyed the confessor so faithfully, that the\nSenora was almost in a state of solitary confinement. Every day her will\nwas growing weaker, her pathetic obedience more childlike and absolute.\n\nBut at midnight, when every one was asleep, Antonia stepped softly into\nher sister’s room and talked to her. They sat in Isabel’s bed clasping\neach other’s hand in the dark, and speaking in whispers. Then Antonia\nwarned and strengthened Isabel. She told her all her fears. She\npersuaded her to control her wilfulness, to be obedient, and to assume\nthe childlike thoughtlessness which best satisfied Fray Ignatius. “He\ntold you to-day to be happy, that he would think for you. My darling,\nlet him believe that is the thing you want,” said Antonia. “I assure you\nwe shall be the safer for it.”\n\n“He said to me yesterday, when I asked him about the war, ‘Do not\ninquire, child, into things you do not understand. That is to be\nirreligious,’ and then he made the cross on his breast, as if I had\nput a bad thought into his heart. We are afraid all day, and we sit\nwhispering all night about our fears; that is the state we are in. The\nLord sends us nothing but misfortunes, Antonia.”\n\n“My darling, tell the Lord your sorrow, then, but do not repine to\nRachela or Fray Ignatius. That is to complain to the merciless of the\nAll-Merciful.”\n\n“Do you think I am wicked, Antonia? What excuse could I offer to His\nDivine Majesty, if I spoke evil to him of Rachela and Fray Ignatius?”\n\n“Neither of them are our friends; do you think so?”\n\n“Fray Ignatius looks like a goblin; he gives me a shiver when he looks\nat me; and as for Rachela--I already hate her!”\n\n“Do not trust her. You need not hate her, Isabel.”\n\n“Antonia, I know that I shall eternally hate her; for I am sure that our\nangels are at variance.”\n\nIn conversations like these the anxious girls passed the long, and\noften very cold, nights. The days were still worse, for as November went\nslowly away the circumstances which surrounded their lives appeared to\nconstantly gather a more decided and a bitterer tone. December, that\nhad always been such a month of happiness, bright with Christmas\nexpectations and Christmas joys, came in with a terribly severe, wet\nnorther. The great log fires only warmed the atmosphere immediately\nsurrounding them, and Isabel and Antonia sat gloomily within it all day.\nIt seemed to Antonia as if her heart had come to the very end of hope;\nand that something must happen.\n\nThe rain lashed the earth; the wind roared around the house, and filled\nit with unusual noises. The cold was a torture that few found themselves\nable to endure. But it brought a compensation. Fray Ignatius did not\nleave the Mission comforts; and Rachela could not bear to go prowling\nabout the corridors and passages. She established herself in the\nSenora’s room, and remained there. And very early in the evening she\nsaid “she had an outrageous headache,” and went to her room.\n\nThen Antonia and Isabel sat awhile by their mother’s bed. They talked in\nwhispers of their father and brothers, and when the Senora cried, they\nkissed her sobs into silence and wiped her tears away. In that hour, if\nFray Ignatius had known it, they undid, in a great measure, the work to\nwhich he had given more than a month of patient and deeply-reflective\nlabor. For with the girls, there was the wondrous charm of love and\nnature; but with the priest, only a splendid ideal of a Church universal\nthat was to swallow up all the claims of love and all the ties of\nnature.\n\nIt was nearly nine o’clock when Antonia and Isabel returned to the\nparlor fire. Their hearts were full of sorrow for their mother, and\nof fears for their own future. For this confidence had shown them how\nfirmly the refuge of the convent had been planted in the anxious ideas\nof the Senora. Fortunately, the cold had driven the servants either to\nthe kitchen fire or to their beds, and they could talk over the subject\nwithout fear of interference.\n\n“Are you sleepy, queridita?”--(little dear).\n\n“I think I shall never go to sleep again, Antonia. If I shut my eyes I\nshall find myself in the convent; and I do not want to go there even in\na dream. Do you know Mother Teresa? Well then, I could tell you things.\nAnd she does not like me, I am sure of that; quite sure.”\n\n“My darling, I am going to make us a cup of tea. It will do us good.”\n\n“If indeed it were chocolate!”\n\n“I cannot make chocolate now; but you shall have a great deal of sugar\nin your cup, and something good to eat also. There, my darling, put\nyour chair close to the fire, and we will sit here until we are quite\nsleepy.”\n\nWith the words she went into the kitchen. Molly was nodding over her\nbeads, in the comfortable radius made by the blazing logs; no one else\nwas present but a young peon. He brought a small kettle to the parlor\nfire, and lifted a table to the hearth, and then replenished the pile\nof logs for burning during the night. Isabel, cuddling in a large chair,\nwatched Antonia, as she went softly about putting on the table such\ndelicacies as she could find at that hour. Tamales and cold duck, sweet\ncake and the guava jelly that was Isabel’s favorite dainty. There was\na little comfort in the sight of these things; and also, in the bright\nsilver teapot standing so cheerfully on the hearth, and diffusing\nthrough the room a warm perfume, at once soothing and exhilarating.\n\n“I really think I shall like that American tea to-night, Antonia, but\nyou must half fill my cup with those little blocks of sugar--quite half\nfill it, Antonia; and have you found cream, my dear one? Then a great\ndeal of cream.”\n\nAntonia stood still a moment and looked at the drowsy little beauty. Her\neyes were closed, and her head nestled comfortably in a corner of the\npadded chair. Then a hand upon the door-handle arrested her attention,\nand Antonia turned her eyes from Isabel and watched it. Ortiz, the peon,\nput his head within the room, and then disappeared; but oh, wonder and\njoy! Don Luis entered swiftly after him; and before any one could say\na word, he was kneeling by Isabel kissing her hand and mingling his\nexclamations of rapture with hers.\n\nAntonia looked with amazement and delight at this apparition. How had he\ncome? She put her hand upon his sleeve; it was scarcely wet. His dress\nwas splendid; if he had been going to a tertullia of the highest class,\nhe could not have been more richly adorned. And the storm was yet\nraging! It was a miracle.\n\n“Dear Luis, sit down! Here is a chair close to Iza! Tell her your\nsecrets a few minutes, and I will go for mi madre. O yes! She will come!\nYou shall see, Iza! And then, Luis, we shall have some supper.”\n\n“You see that I am in heaven already, Antonia; though, indeed, I am also\nhungry and thirsty, my sister.”\n\nAntonia was not a minute in reaching her mother’s room. The unhappy lady\nwas half-lying among the large pillows of her gilded bed, wide awake.\nHer black eyes were fixed upon a crucifix at its foot, and she was\nslowly murmuring prayers upon her rosary.\n\n“Madre! Madre! Luis is here, Luis is here! Come quick, mi madre. Here\nare your stockings and slippers, and your gown, and your mantilla--no,\nno, no, do not call Rachela. Luis has news of my father, and of Jack!\nOh, madre, he has a letter from Jack to you! Come dear, come, in a few\nminutes you will be ready.”\n\nShe was urging and kissing the trembling woman, and dressing her in\ndespite of her faint effort to delay--to call Rachela--to bring Luis\nto her room. In ten minutes she was ready. She went down softly, like a\nfrightened child, Antonia cheering and encouraging her in whispers.\n\nWhen she entered the cheerful parlor the shadow of a smile flitted\nover her wan face. Luis ran to meet her. He drew the couch close to the\nhearth; he helped Antonia arrange her comfortably upon it. He made her\ntea, and kissed her hands when he put it into them. And then Isabel made\nLuis a cup, and cut his tamales, and waited upon him with such pretty\nservice, that the happy lover thought he was eating a meal in Paradise.\n\nFor a few minutes it had been only this ordinary gladness of reunion;\nbut it was impossible to ignore longer the anxiety in the eyes that\nasked him so many questions. He took two letters from his pockets and\ngave them to the Senora. They were from her husband and Jack. Her hands\ntrembled; she kissed them fervently; and as she placed them in her\nbreast her tears dropped down upon them.\n\nAntonia opened the real conversation with that never-failing wedge,\nthe weather. “You came through the storm, Luis? Yet you are not wet,\nscarcely? Now then, explain this miracle.”\n\n“I went first to Lopez Navarro’s. Do you not know this festa dress? It\nis the one Lopez bought for the feast of St. James. He lent it to me,\nfor I assure you that my own clothing was like that of a beggar man. It\nwas impossible that I could see my angel on earth in it.”\n\n“But in such weather? You can not have come far to-day?”\n\n“Senorita, there are things which are impossible, quite impossible!\nThat is one of them. Early this morning the north wind advanced upon\nus, sword in hand. It will last fifty hours, and we shall know\nsomething more about it before they are over. Very well, but it was also\nabsolutely necessary that some one should reach San Antonio to-night;\nand I was so happy as to persuade General Burleson to send me. The Holy\nLady has given me my reward.”\n\n“Have you seen the Senor Doctor lately; Luis,” asked the Senora.\n\n“I left him at nightfall.”\n\n“At nightfall! But that is impossible!”\n\n“It is true. The army of the Americans is but a few miles from San\nAntonio.”\n\n“Grace of God! Luis!”\n\n“As you say, Senora. It is the grace of God. Did you not know?”\n\n“We know nothing but what Fray Ignatius tells us--that the Americans\nhave been everywhere pulling down churches, and granting martyrdom to\nthe priests, and that everywhere miraculous retributions have pursued\nthem.”\n\n“Was Gonzales a retribution? The Senor Doctor came to us while we were\nthere. God be blessed; but he startled us like the rattle of rifle-shots\nin the midnight! ‘Why were you not at Goliad?’ he cried. ‘There were\nthree hundred stand of arms there, and cannon, and plenty of provisions.\nWhy were they not yours?’ You would have thought, Senora, he had been a\nsoldier all his life. The men caught fire when he came near them, and we\nwent to Goliad like eagles flying for their prey. We took the town,\nand the garrison, and all the arms and military stores. I will tell you\nsomething that came to pass there. At midnight, as I and Jack stood\nwith the Senor Doctor by the camp-fire, a stranger rode up to us. It was\nColonel Milam. He was flying from a Mexican prison and had not heard\nof the revolt of the Americans. He made the camp ring with his shout\nof delight. He was impatient for the morning. He was the first man that\nentered the garrison. Bravissimo! What a soldier is he!”\n\n“I remember! I remember!” cried the Senora. “Mi Roberto brought him here\nonce. So splendid a man I never saw before. So tall, so handsome, so\ngallant, so like a hero. He is an American from--well, then, I have\nforgotten the place.”\n\n“From Kentucky. He fought with the Mexicans when they were fighting for\ntheir liberty; but when they wanted a king and a dictator he resigned\nhis commision{sic} and was thrown into prison. He has a long bill\nagainst Santa Anna.”\n\n“We must not forget, Luis,” said the Senora with a little flash of her\nold temper, “that Santa Anna represents to good Catholics the triumph of\nHoly Church.”\n\nLuis devoutly crossed himself. “I am her dutiful son, I assure you,\nSenora--always.”\n\nA warning glance from Antonia changed the conversation. There was plenty\nto tell which touched them mainly on the side of the family, and the\nSenora listened, with pride which she could not conceal, to the exploits\nof her husband and sons, though she did not permit herself to\nconfess the feeling. And her heart softened to her children. Without\nacknowledging the tie between Isabel and Luis, she permitted or was\noblivious to the favors it allowed.\n\nCertainly many little formalities could be dispensed with, in a meeting\nso unexpected and so eventful. When the pleasant impromptu meal was\nover, even the Senora had eaten and drunk with enjoyment. Then Luis set\nthe table behind them, and they drew closer to the fire, Luis holding\nIsabel’s hand, and Antonia her mother’s. The Senora took a cigarette\nfrom Luis, and Isabel sometimes put that of Luis between her rosy\nlips. At the dark, cold midnight they found an hour or two of sweetest\nconsolation. It was indeed hard to weary these three heart-starved\nwomen; they asked question after question, and when any brought out\nthe comical side of camp life they forget their pleasure was almost a\nclandestine one, and laughed outright.\n\nIn the very midst of such a laugh, Rachela entered the room. She stood\nin speechless amazement, gazing with a dark, malicious face upon the\nhappy group. “Senorita Isabel!” she screamed; “but this is abominable!\nAt the midnight also! Who could have believed in such wickedness? Grace\nof Mary, it is inconceivable!”\n\nShe laid her hand roughly on Isabel’s shoulder, and Luis removed it with\nas little courtesy. “You were not called,” he said, with the haughty\ninsolence of a Mexican noble to a servant--“Depart.”\n\n“My Senora! Listen! You yourself also--you will die. You that are really\nweak--so broken-hearted--”\n\nThen a miracle occurred. The Senora threw off the nightmare of selfish\nsorrow and spiritual sentimentality which had held her in bondage. She\ntook the cigarito from her lips with a scornful air, and repeated the\nwords of Luis:\n\n“You were not called. Depart.”\n\n“The Senorita Isabel?”\n\n“Is in my care. Her mother’s care! do you understand?”\n\n“My Senora, Fray Ignatius--”\n\n“Saints in heaven! But this is intolerable! Go.”\n\nThen Rachela closed the door with a clang which echoed through the\nhouse. And say as we will, the malice of the wicked is never quite\nfutile. It was impossible after this interruption to recall the happy\nspirit dismissed by it; and Rachela had the consolation, as she muttered\nbeside the fire in the Senora’s room, this conviction. So that when she\nheard the party breaking up half an hour afterwards, she complimented\nherself upon her influence.\n\n“Will Jack come and see me soon, and the Senor Doctor?” questioned the\nSenora, anxiously, as she held the hand of Luis in parting.\n\n“Jack is on a secret message to General Houston. His return advices will\nfind us, I trust, in San Antonio. But until we have taken the city, no\nAmerican can safely enter it. For this reason, when it was necessary to\ngive Lopez Navarro certain instructions, I volunteered to bring them.\nBy the Virgin of Guadalupe! I have had my reward,” he said, lifting the\nSenora’s hand and kissing it.\n\n“But, then, even you are in danger.”\n\n“Si! If I am discovered; but, blessed be the hand of God! Luis Alveda\nknows where he is going, and how to get there.”\n\n“I have heard,” said the Senora in a hushed voice, “that there are to be\nno prisoners. That is Santa Anna’s order.”\n\n“I heard it twenty days ago, and am still suffocating over it.”\n\n“Ah, Luis, you do not know the man yet! I heard Fray Ignatius say that.”\n\n“We know him well; and also what he is capable of”; and Luis plucked his\nmustache fiercely, as he bowed a silent farewell to the ladies.\n\n“Holy Maria! How brave he is!” said Isabel, with a flash of pride that\nconquered her desire to weep. “How brave he is! Certainly, if he meets\nSanta Anna, he will kill him.”\n\nThey went very quietly up-stairs. The Senora was anticipating the\ninterview she expected with Rachela, and, perhaps wisely, she isolated\nherself in an atmosphere of sullen and haughty silence. She would\naccept nothing from her, not even sympathy or flattery; and, in a curt\ndismission, managed to make her feel the immeasurable distance between\na high-born lady of the house of Flores, and a poor manola that she had\ntaken from the streets of Madrid. Rachela knew the Senora was thinking\nof this circumstance; the thought was in her voice, and it cowed and\nsnubbed the woman, her nature being essentially as low as her birth.\n\nAs for the Senora, the experience did her a world of good. She waited\nupon herself as a princess might condescend to minister to her own\nwants--loftily, with a smile at her own complaisance. The very knowledge\nthat her husband was near at hand inspired her with courage. She went to\nsleep assuring herself “that not even Fray Ignatius should again speak\nevil of her beloved, who never thought of her except with a loyal\naffection.” For in married life, the wife can sin against love as well\nas fidelity; and she thought with a sob of the cowardice which had\npermitted Fray Ignatius to call her dear one “rebel and heretic.”\n\n“Santa Dios!” she said in a passionate whisper; “it is not a mortal sin\nto think differently from Santa Anna”--and then more tenderly--“those\nwho love each other are of the same faith.”\n\nAnd if Fray Ignatius had seen at that moment the savage whiteness of her\nsmall teeth behind the petulant pout of her parted lips, he might\nhave understood that this woman of small intelligence had also the\nunreasoning partisanship and the implacable sense of anger which\ngenerally accompanies small intelligence, and which indicates a nature\ngoverned by feeling, and utterly irresponsive to reasoning which feeling\ndoes not endorse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. MOTHER AND PRIEST.\n\n           .  .  .  .   “witness,\n\n         When the dark-stoled priestly crew,\n         Came swift trooping where the trumpet\n         Of foul Santa Anna blew.”\n          *   *   *   *   *\n\n        “Rouse thee, Wrath, and be a giant;\n         People’s Will, that hath been pliant,\n                        Long, too long;\n\n         Up, and snap the rusty chaining,\n         Brittle bond for thy restraining,\n         Know the hour, the weak are reigning\n                        Thou art strong.\n\n         *  *   *   *   *\n\n        “Rise and right the wrongs of ages;\n         Balance Time’s unequal pages\n                        With the sword.”\n\n\nIt was nearly two o’clock when Don Luis mounted his horse and left the\nWorth residencia. The storm still raged, the night was dark, the cold\nintense, but the home of Lopez Navarro was scarce a quarter of a mile\naway; and he found him waiting his return.\n\n“You have still an hour, Luis. Come in and sit with me.”\n\n“As you say; and I wish to show you that I am capable of a great thing.\nYou do not believe me? Well, then give me again my own clothes. I will\nresign these.”\n\n“You are most welcome to them, Luis.”\n\n“But no; I am in earnest. The fight is at hand--they are too fine.”\n\n“Yes, but I will tell you--I can say anything to you--there is to be a\ngrand day for freedom; well, then, for a festa one puts on the best that\nis to be got. I will even lend you my Cross of Saint James, if you wish.\nA young hero should be dressed like a hero. Honor my poor clothes so far\nas to wear them in the fight.”\n\n“Thank you, Lopez. I will not disgrace them”; and he bent forward and\nlooked into his friend’s eyes. His glance prolonged his words--went\nfurther than speech--went where speech could not reach.\n\n“Listen to me, Luis. As a matter of precision, where now are the\nAmericans?”\n\n“At the mission of Espada.”\n\n“La Espada?--the sword--the name is ominous.”\n\n“Of success, Lopez.”\n\n“Is Houston, then, with you?”\n\n“Until a few days ago. He and General Austin have gone to San Felipe.”\n\n“For what? Is not San Antonio the most important point?”\n\n“It was decided by the vote of the army to send them there to frame a\nprovisional government. There are plenty of fighters with us, but not\none statesman but Houston. And now it is necessary that we should have\nlegal authority to obtain loans, maintain the army in the field, and\nmany other such things vital to our cause. Austin is to go to the United\nStates. He will bring back men and money. Houston must draw up our\ndeclaration and manifestoes; direct the civil government; forward\ntroops; and, in fact, set a new government in motion.”\n\n“He is the loadstone in the bosom! [2] I wonder that the Americans\npermitted that he should leave them.”\n\n“He, and he only, was the man to go. Ere he left, he said some strange\nwords. I shall not, as a Mexican, forget them. In the midst of the men\nhe stood like a god, with his great stature, and his bright, strong\nface. One cannot think of him as of a common mortal. Indeed, I will\nconfess that I could only compare him with the Efreet in the Arabian\ntale, ‘whose nostrils were like trumpets, his eyes like lamps, and who\nhad dishevelled, dust colored hair’”\n\n“But, to proceed; what were the strange words?”\n\n“Thus he spoke, and his voice rang out like a clarion:\n\n“‘You will fight as men fight for their homes, and their wives, and\ntheir children, but also--remember this--the idea of Texas is in the\nAmerican heart! Two generations they have carried it there! It is your\ndestiny to make the idea a fact! As far back as eighteen nineteen, Adams\nwanted Texas. When Adams became president, he told Poinsett to offer\nMexico a million of dollars for Texas. Clay would have voted three\nmillions. Van Buren, in eighteen twenty-nine, told Poinsett to offer\nfive millions for Texas. I went to Washington that year, and proposed to\nrevolutionize Texas. I declare to you that the highest men in the land\nwere of my mind. Only last July President Jackson offered an additional\nhalf million dollars for the Rio Grande boundary; and Mr. Secretary\nForsyth said, justly or unjustly, by hook, or by crook, Texas must\nbecome part of our country. We have been longing for it for fifty years!\nNow, then, brothers-in-arms!’ he cried, ‘You are here for your homes\nand your freedom; but, more than that, you are here for your country!’\nRemember the thousands of Americans who have slipped out of history and\nout of memory, who have bought this land with their blood! We have held\na grip on Texas for fifty years. By the soul of every American who has\nperished here, I charge you, No Surrender!’\n\n“You should have heard the shout that answered the charge. Jesu, Maria!\nIt made my heart leap to my bosom. And ever since, the two words have\nfilled the air. You could see men catching them on their lips. They\nare in their eyes, and their walk. Their hands say them. The up-toss of\ntheir heads says them. When they go into battle they will see Houston in\nfront of them, and hear him call back ‘No surrender!’ Mexico cannot hold\nTexas against such a determined purpose, carried out by such determined\nmen.”\n\nLopez did not answer. He was a melancholy, well-read man, who had\ntravelled, and to whom the idea of liberty was a passion. But the\nfeeling of race was also strong in him, and he could not help regretting\nthat liberty must come to Texas through an alien people--“heretics,\ntoo”--he muttered, carrying the thought out aloud. It brought others\nequally living to him, and he asked, “Where, then, is Doctor Worth?”\n\n“At Espada. The army wished him to go to San Felipe with Houston, but\nhe declined. And we want him most of all, both as a fighter and a\nphysician. His son Thomas went in his place.”\n\n“I know not Thomas.”\n\n“Indeed, very few know him. He is one that seldom speaks. But his rifle\nhas its word always ready.”\n\n“And Jack?”\n\n“Jack also went to San Felipe. He is to bring back the first despatches.\nJack is the darling of the camp. Ah, what a happy soul he has! One would\nthink that it had just come from heaven, or was just going there.”\n\n“Did you see Senorita Antonia to-night?”\n\n“Si! She is a blessing to the eyesight. So brave a young girl, so sweet,\nso wise; she is a miracle! If I loved not Isabel with my whole soul, I\nwould kneel at Antonia’s feet.”\n\n“That is where I also would kneel.”\n\n“Hark! how the wind roars, and how the rain thrashes the house! But our\nmen have the shelter of one of the Panchos. You should have heard the\npadre threaten them with the anger of heaven and hell and General Cos.\nGood-bye, Lopez. I have stayed my last moment now.”\n\n“Your horse has been well fed. Listen, he is neighing for you; to Doctor\nWorth give my honorable regards. Is Senor Parades with you? and Perez\nMexia? Say to them I keep the vow I made in their behalf. Farewell,\nLuis!” and Luis, who had been mounting as his friend talked, stooped\nfrom his saddle and kissed him.\n\nIt was just dawn when he reached camp, and he found Doctor Worth waiting\nhis arrival. Fortunately there was nothing but good news for the doctor.\nLuis had seen everything through the medium of his own happiness, and he\ndescribed the midnight meal and the Senora’s amiability with the utmost\nfreedom from anything unpleasant. Rachela’s interference he treated with\nscornful indifference; and yet it affected Worth’s mind unpleasantly.\nFor it went straight to the source of offence. “She must have had Fray\nIgnatius behind her. And my poor Maria, she will be as dough for them to\nknead as they desire to!”\n\nAnd, in fact, as he was thus thinking, the Senora was lying awake in her\nbed, anticipating her confessor’s next visit. She was almost glad the\nnorther was still blowing. It would give her another day’s respite; and\n“so many things happen as the clock goes round,” she reflected. Perhaps\neven her Roberto might arrive; it would not be more wonderful than the\nvisit of Luis Alveda.\n\nBut very early in the day she saw the father hurrying up the oleander\navenue. The wind tossed his gown, and blew his hat backward and\nsideways, and compelled him to make undignified haste. And such little\nthings affect the mental poise and mood! The Senora smiled at the funny\nfigure he made; and with the smile came a feeling of resistance to his\ntyranny, and a stubborn determination to defend her own conduct.\n\nHe came into her room with a doleful countenance, saying, as he crossed\nhimself, “God be here!”\n\n“And with you, father,” answered the Senora, cheerfully--a mood she had\nassumed at the last moment, by a kind of instinct.\n\n“There is evil news on every hand my daughter. The heretics are swarming\nlike wolves around the Missions. Several of our holy brothers have\nendured the last extremity. These wolves will even enter the city, and\nyou will be in danger. I have come to take you to the convent. There,\nHoly Mary will be your safety.”\n\n“But these wolves might attack the convent, father!”\n\n“Our Blessed Lady is stronger than they. She has always kept her own.”\n\n“Blessed be the hand of God and Mary! will trust in them. Ah, Antonia!\nListen to Fray Ignatius! He says we must go to the convent--the heretics\nare coming. They have even slain some priests at the Mission.”\n\n“Fray Ignatius has been misinformed, dear mother. When a man wears a\ngown and has no arms Americans do not molest him. That is certain. As\nfor the convent it is impossible. My father forbade it. If the Americans\nenter the city, he is with them. He will protect us, if we should need\nit, which is not likely.”\n\n“Disobedient one!”\n\n“Pardon. I wish only to obey the commands of my father.”\n\n“I absolve you from them.”\n\n“They are between God and my soul. There is no absolution from duty.”\n\n“Grace of God! Hear you, Senora! Hear you the rebellious and disobedient\none! She has defied me to my face! She is near to being anathema! She is\nnot your daughter! She is bewitched. Some evil spirit has possession of\nher. Let no one touch her or speak to her; it shall be a mortal sin.”\n\nAntonia fell at her mother’s knee. “Mi madre! I am your daughter, your\nAntonia, that you carried in your breast, and that loves you better than\nlife. Permit me not to be accused of sin--to be called a devil. Mother,\nspeak for me.”\n\nAt this moment Isabel entered. Seeing the distress of her mother and\nsister she hastened to them; but Fray Ignatius stepped between, and\nextending his arms forbade her nearer approach.\n\n“I forbid you to speak to your sister. I forbid you to touch her, to\ngive her food, or water, or sympathy, until she has humbled herself, and\nobtained the forgiveness of her sin.”\n\nThen mother love stood up triumphant over superstition. “I and my\ndaughter are the same,” said the Senora, and she gave her hand to\nAntonia. “If she has sinned, we will bear the penance together; she and\nI together.”\n\n“I command you to stand apart. For the good of Antonia’s sinful soul, I\ncommand you to withdraw yourself from her.”\n\n“She is my daughter, father. I will bear the sin and the punishment with\nher. The Holy Mother will understand me. To her I will go.”\n\nThe door of her room was at hand; she stepped swiftly to it, and putting\nher daughters before her, passed in and turned the key.\n\nThe movement took the priest by surprise, and yet he was secretly\nsatisfied with it. He had permitted himself to act with an imprudence\nmost unusual. He had allowed the Senora to find out her own moral\nstrength, and made a situation for her in which she had acted not only\nwithout his support, but against his authority.\n\n“And yet,” he muttered, “so much depends upon my persuading her into\nthe convent; however, nothing now is to be done to-day, except to see\nRachela. Saint Joseph! if these American heretics were only in my power!\nWhat a long joy I would make of them! I would cut a throat--just one\nthroat--every day of my life.”\n\nThe hatred which could contemplate a vengeance so long drawn out was on\nhis dark face; yet, it is but justice to say, that he sincerely believed\nit to be a holy hatred. The foes of the church, he regarded as the foes\nof God; and his anger as a just zeal for the honor of the Lord of Hosts.\nBeside which, it included a far more tangible cause.\n\nThe accumulated treasures of the Missions; their gold and gems, their\ncostly vestments and holy vessels, had been removed to the convent for\nsafety. “These infidels of Americans give to women the honor they should\ngive to God and Holy Church,” he said to his brethren. “They will not\nsuffer the Sisters to be molested; and our wealth will be safe wherever\nthey are.”\n\nBut this wealth was really so immense, that he believed it might be\nwell to secure it still further, and knowing the position Dr. Worth held\namong his countrymen, he resolved to induce his wife and daughters\nto seek refuge within the convent. They were, in fact, to be held as\nhostages, for the protection of the property of the Church.\n\nThat he should fail in his plan was intolerable to him. He had been\nso confident of success. He imagined the smile on the face of Fray\nSarapiam, and the warning against self-confidence he would receive from\nhis superior; and he vowed by Saint Joseph that he would not suffer\nhimself to be so mortified by three women.\n\nHad he seen the Senora after the first excitement of her rebellion was\nover, he would have been satisfied of the validity of his authority,\nat least as regarded her. She flung herself at the foot of her altar,\nweeping and beating her breast in a passion of self-accusation and\ncontrition. Certainly, she had stood by her daughter in the presence of\nthe priest; but in her room she withdrew herself from the poor girl as\nif she were a spiritual leper.\n\nAntonia at a distance watched the self-abasement of her mother. She\ncould not weep, but she was white as clay, and her heart was swollen\nwith a sense of wrong and injustice, until breathing was almost\nsuffocation. She looked with a piteous entreaty at Isabel. Her little\nsister had taken a seat at the extremity of the room away from her. She\nwatched Antonia with eyes full of terror. But there was no sympathy in\nher face, only an uncertainty which seemed to speak to her--to touch\nher--and her mother was broken-hearted with shame and grief.\n\nThe anxiety was also a dumb one. Until the Senora rose from her knees,\nthere was not a movement made, not a word uttered. The girls waited\nshivering with cold, sick with fear, until she spoke. Even then her\nwords were cold as the wind outside:\n\n“Go to your room, Antonia. You have not only sinned; you have made me\nsin also. Alas! Alas! Miserable mother! Holy Maria! pray for me.”\n\n“Mi madre, I am innocent of wrong. I have committed no sin. Is it a sin\nto obey my father? Isabel, darling, speak for me.”\n\n“But, then, what have you done, Antonia?”\n\n“Fray Ignatius wants us to go to the convent. I refused. My father made\nme promise to do so. Is not our first duty to our father? Mother, is it\nnot?\n\n“No, no; to God--and to Fray Ignatius, as the priest of God. He says we\nought to go to the convent. He knows best. We have been disobedient and\nwicked.”\n\n“Isabel, speak, my dear one. Tell mi madre if you think we should go.”\n\nThere was a moment’s wavering, and then Isabel went to her mother and\ncaressed her as only Isabel could caress her, and with the kisses, she\nsaid boldly: “Mi madre, we will not go to the convent. Not any of us. It\nis a dreadful place, even for a happy child. Oh, how cold and still are\nthe Sisters! They are like stone figures that move about.”\n\n“Hush, child! I cannot listen to you! Go away! I must be alone. I must\nthink. I must pray. Only the Mother of Sorrows can help me.”\n\nIt was a miserable sequence to the happy night, and Antonia was really\nterrified at the position in which she found herself. If the Americans\nshould fall, nothing but flight, or uncompromising submission to Fray\nIgnatius, remained for her. She knew only too well how miserable\nher life could be made; what moral torture could be inflicted; what\nspiritual servitude exacted. In a moment of time she had comprehended\nher danger, and her heart sank and sickened with a genuine physical\nterror.\n\nThe cold was still severe, and no one answered her call for wood. Isabel\ncrouched, white and shivering, over the dying embers, and it was she who\nfirst uttered the fear Antonia had refused to admit to herself--“Suppose\nthe servants are forbidden to wait upon us!”\n\n“I will bring wood myself, dearest.” She was greatly comforted by\nthe word “us.” She could almost have wept for joy of the sympathy it\nincluded. For thought is rapid in such crucial moments, and she had\ndecided that even flight with her would be a kinder fate for Isabel,\nthan the cruel tender mercies of the Sisters and the convent.\n\nThey could not talk much. The thought of their mother’s anguish, and\nof the separation put between them and their household, shocked and\nterrified them. Vainly they called for fuel. At dinner time no table was\nlaid, and no preparations made for the meal. Then Antonia went into the\nkitchen. She took with her food, and cooked it. She brought wood into\nthe parlor, and made up the fire. Fortunately, her northern education\nhad given her plenty of resources for such emergencies. Two or three\nsavory dishes were soon ready, and the small table set upon a warm,\nbright hearth.\n\nThe Senora had evidently not been included in the ban, for Rachela\nattended with ostentatious care to her comfort; but Isabel had rolled\nherself up in a wadded silk coverlet and gone to sleep. Antonia awakened\nher with a kiss. “Come, queridita, and get your dinner.”\n\n“But is it possible? I thought Fray Ignatius had forbidden it.”\n\n“He cannot forbid me to wait upon you, my darling one. And he cannot\nturn the flour into dust, and the meat into stone. There is a good\ndinner ready; and you are hungry, no doubt.”\n\n“For three hours I have been faint. Ah! you have made me a custard also!\nYou are a very comforter.”\n\nBut the girl was still and sad, and Antonia was hard pressed to find\nany real comfort for her. For she knew that their only hope lay in the\nimmediate attack of the American force, and its success; and she did not\nthink it wise to hide from her sister the alternatives that lay before\nthem if the Americans failed.\n\n“I am afraid,” said Isabel; “and so unhappy. A very sad business is\nlife. I cannot think how any one can care to live.”\n\n“Remember Luis, and our father, and Jack, and Thomas, and our dear\nmother, who this morning stood between us and Fray Ignatius. Will you\nlet this priest turn the sky black above you?”\n\n“And also, men will fight. What for? Who can tell? The Americans want\nso much of everything. Naturally they do not get all they want. What do\nthey do? Fight, and get killed. Then they go into the next world, and\ncomplain of people. As for Luis, I do not expect to see him again.”\n\nFortunately, the norther moderated at sunset. Life then seemed so much\nmore possible. Adverse elements intensify adverse fortune, and the\nphysical suffering from the cold had also benumbed Antonia’s spirits,\nand made her less hopeful and less clear-visioned. But when she awoke\nat the gray dawn of the next day, she awoke with a different spirit. She\nhad regained herself. She rose quietly, and looked out towards the city.\nThe black flag from the Alamo and the Missions hung above it. She looked\nat the ominous standards, and then the tears sprang to her eyes; she\nlifted her face and her hands to heaven, and a few words, swifter\nthan light, sprang from her soul into the ear of the Eternal Father of\nSpirits.\n\nThe answer came with the petition--came with the crack of rifle shots;\nprecise, regular, unceasing.\n\n“Oh God! I thank Thee! Lord of Hosts, Thou art a great multitude!\nIsabel! Isabel! The Americans are attacking the city! Our father will\nfight his way back to his home! Fray Ignatius can not come to-day. Oh,\nI am so happy! So happy! Listen! How the Mexicans are shouting! They are\ncheering on the men! What a turmoil!”\n\n“Jesu, Maria, have mercy!” cried Isabel, clasping her crucifix and\nfalling upon her knees.\n\n“Oh, Isabel, pray for our father, that his angel may overshadow him with\nstrong wings.”\n\n“And Luis?”\n\n“And Luis, and Thomas, and Jack, and Dare. There are prayers for them\nall, and love enough to make them. Hark! there are the drums, and the\ntrumpets, and the gallop of the cavalry. Come, dearest, let us go to our\nmother. To day, no one will remember Fray Ignatius.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THE STORMING OF THE ALAMO.\n\n                            “Now, hearts,\n         Be ribbed with iron for this one attempt:\n         Set ope’ your sluices, send the vigorous blood\n         Through every active limb for our relief.”\n\n        “Now they begin the tragic play,\n         And with their smoky cannon banish day.”\n\n        “Endure and conquer.  God will soon dispose\n         To future good our past and present woes:\n         Resume your courage, and dismiss your care;\n         An hour will come with pleasure to relate\n         Your sorrows past, as benefits of Fate.”\n\n\nThe Senora was already dressed. She turned with a face full of fear and\nanger to her daughters as they entered her room--\n\n“These American diablos! They are attacking the city. They will take\nit--that is to be expected--who can fight diablos? And what is to become\nof us? Oh, Antonia! Why did you prevent Fray Ignatius? We might now have\nbeen safe in the convent”, and Rachela nodded her head in assent, with\nan insufferable air of reproof and toleration.\n\nAntonia saw that the time had not yet come for pleading her own cause.\nShe left Isabel with her mother. The Senora’s breakfast was waiting,\nand she offered to share it with her youngest daughter. Antonia went\ndownstairs to prepare for herself some coffee. She was surprised and\npleased to find it made. For a certain thought had come to Molly in the\nnight and she had acted upon it--\n\n“The praist is a strange praist, and almost as black as a nagur; and I’d\nbe a poor body, I think, to let him be meddling wid my work. Shure,\nI never heard of the like of such interfering in Ireland, nor in the\nStates at all!” Then turning to the Mexican cook, Manuel--“You may lave\nthe fire alone till I bees done wid it.”\n\n“Fray Ignatius will not give you absolution if you disobey him.”\n\n“He can be kaping the same then. There is an Irish praist at San\nPatricio, and I’ll be going there for my absolution; and I’ll be getting\nnone any nearer that an Irish soul will be a pin the better for. I’ll\nsay that, standing in the church, to the saints themselves; and so be\naff wid you and let the fire alone till I bees done wid it.”\n\nBut it was not Molly’s place to serve the food she cooked, and she did\nnot trouble herself about the serving. When she had asserted her right\nto control her own work, and do it or neglect it as it seemed good to\nherself alone, she was satisfied. Over Antonia--who was at least half\na Mexican--she acknowledged a Mexican priest to have authority; and she\nhad no intention of interfering between Fray Ignatius and his lawful\nflock. She was smoking her pipe by the fire when Antonia entered the\nkitchen, and she neither lifted her eyes nor spoke to her.\n\nAgainst such unreasonable isolation Antonia could not help a feeling of\nanger; and she heard with satisfaction the regular crack of the rifles.\nHer thought was--“They will make these people find their tongues also,\nvery soon.” She was exceedingly anxious for information; and, as she ate\nher roll and drank her coffees she was considering how they could gain\nit. For even if Fray Ignatius were able to visit them, his report would\nbe colored by his prejudices and his desires, and could not be relied\non.\n\nHer heart fluttered and sank; she was hot and cold, sanguine and\nfearful. She could not endure the idea of a suspense unrelieved by\nany reliable word. For the siege might be a long one. San Antonio was\nstrongly walled and defended. The Alamo fortress stood in its centre.\nIt had forty-eight cannon, and a garrison of a thousand men. Before it\ncould be reached, the city had to be taken; and the inhabitants would in\nthe main fight desperately for their homes.\n\nAs soon as she was alone with her mother, she pointed out these facts to\nher. “Let me write to Lopez Navarro, mi madre. He is a friend.”\n\n“Of the Americans! Si.”\n\n“Of freedom. He will send us word.”\n\n“Are you forgetful of what is moral and respectable, Antonia? That a\nyoung lady should write to Lopez Navarro--a man that is unmarried--is\nsuch a thing as never before happened! He would think the world had come\nto an end, or worse.”\n\n“Dear mother! In a time of trouble like this, who would think wrong of\nus? Surely you might write.”\n\n“As you say, Antonia. Tell me, then, who will take the letter.”\n\n“The peon Ortiz will take it. This morning he brought in wood and\nkindled the fire, and I saw in his face the kindness of his heart.”\n\nAfter some further persuasion, the Senora agreed to write; and Ortiz\nundertook the commission, with a nod of understanding. Then there\nremained nothing to be done but to listen and to watch. Fortunately,\nhowever, Rachela found the centre of interest among the servants in\nthe kitchen; and the Senora and her daughter could converse without\nespionage.\n\nJust after sunset a letter arrived from Navarro. Rachela lingered in the\nroom to learn its contents. But the Senora, having read them, passed the\nletter to Antonia and Isabel; and Rachela saw with anger that Antonia,\nhaving carefully considered it, threw it into the fire. And yet the news\nit brought was not unfavorable:\n\n     “SENORA MARIA FLORES WORTH:\n\n     “I send this on December the fifth, in the year of our\n     Blessed Lord and Lady 1835.  It is my honor and pleasure to\n     tell you that the Americans, having performed miracles of\n     valor, reached the Plaza this afternoon.  Here the main body\n     of the Mexican troops received them, and there has been severe\n     fighting.  At sunset, the Mexicans retreated within the Alamo.\n     The Texans have taken possession of the Veramendi House, and\n     the portion of the city surrounding it.  There has been a\n     great slaughter of our poor countrymen.  I charge myself\n     whenever I pass the Plaza, to say a paternoster for the souls\n     who fell there.  Senora Maria Flores Worth, I kiss your hands.\n     I kiss also the hands of the Senorita Antonia, and the hands\n     of the Senorita Isabel, and I make haste to sign myself,\n                     “Your servant,\n                             “LOPEZ NAVARRO.”\n\n\nThis little confidence between mother and daughters restored the tone\nof feeling between them. They had something to talk of, personal\nand exclusive. In the fear and uncertainty, they forgot priestly\ninterdiction and clung to each other with that affection which is the\nstrength of danger and the comforter of sorrow.\n\nOn the following day the depression deepened. The sounds of battle\nwere closer at hand. The Mexican servants had an air of insolence and\ntriumph. Antonia feared for the evening’s report--if indeed Navarro\nshould be able to send one. She feared more when she saw the messenger\nearly in the afternoon. “Too early is often worse than too late.” The\nproverb shivered upon her trembling lips as she took the letter from\nhim. The three women read it together, with sinking hearts:\n\n\n     “SENORA MARIA FLORES WORTH:\n\n     “This on the sixth of December, in the year of our Blessed\n     Lord and Lady 1835.  The brave, the illustrious Colonel Milam\n     is dead.  I watched him three hours in to-day’s fight.  A man\n     so calm was inconceivable.  He was smiling when the ball\n     struck him--when he fell.  The Texans, after his loss, retired\n     to their quarters.  This was at the hour of eleven.  At the\n     hour of one, the Mexicans made another sortie from the Alamo.\n     The Texans rushed to meet them with an incredible vengeance.\n     Their leader was General Burleson.  He showed himself to\n     General Cos in a sheet of flame.  Such men are not to be\n     fought.  General Cos was compelled to retire to the Alamo.\n     The battle is over for to-day.  On this earth the soul has but\n     a mortal sword.  The water in the river is red with\n     blood.  The Plaza is covered with the dead and the dying.  I\n     have the honor to tell you that these ‘miserables’ are being\n     attended to by the noble, the charitable Senor Doctor Worth.\n     As I write, he is kneeling among them.  My soul adores his\n     humanity.  I humbly kiss your hands, Senora, and the hands of\n     your exalted daughters.\n                                 “LOPEZ NAVARRO.\n\n\nUntil midnight this letter furnished the anxious, loving women with an\nunceasing topic of interest. The allusion to her husband made the Senora\nweep. She retired to her oratory and poured out her love and her fears\nin holy salutations, in thanksgivings and entreaties.\n\nThe next morning there was an ominous lull in the atmosphere. As men\nrun backward to take a longer leap forward, so both armies were taking\nbreath for a fiercer struggle. In the Worth residencia the suspense\nwas becoming hourly harder to endure. The Senora and her daughters\nwere hardly conscious of the home life around them. In that wonderful\nfolk-speech which so often touches foundation truths, they were not all\nthere. Their nobler part had projected itself beyond its limitations. It\nwas really in the struggle. It mattered little to them now whether food\nwas cooked or not. They were neither hungry nor sleepy. Existence was\nprayer and expectation.\n\nJust before sunset Antonia saw Don Lopez coming through the garden. The\nSenora, accompanied by her daughters, went to meet him. His face was\nperplexed and troubled:\n\n“General Cos has been joined by Ugartechea with three hundred men,” he\nsaid. “You will see now that the fight will be still more determined.”\n\nAnd before daylight broke on the morning of the 5th, the Americans\nattacked the Alamo. The black flag waved above them; the city itself had\nthe stillness of death; but for hours the dull roar and the clamorous\ntumult went on without cessation. The Senora lay upon her bed\nmotionless, with hands tightly locked. She had exhausted feeling, and\nwas passive. Antonia and Isabel wandered from window to window, hoping\nto see some token which would indicate the course of events.\n\nNothing was visible but the ferocious flag flying out above the\ndesperate men fighting below it. So black! So cruel and defiant it\nlooked! It seemed to darken and fill the whole atmosphere around it.\nAnd though the poor women had not dared to whisper to each other what\nit said to them, they knew in their own hearts that it meant, if the\nAmericans failed, the instant and brutal massacre of every prisoner.\n\nThe husband and father were under its inhuman shadow. So most probably\nwere Darius Grant and Luis Alveda. It was even likely that Jack might\nhave returned ere the fight, and was with the besiegers. Every time they\nwent to the window, it filled their hearts with horror.\n\nIn the middle of the afternoon it suddenly disappeared. Antonia watched\nit breathlessly. Several times before, it had been dropped by some\nAmerican rifle; but this time it was not as speedily replaced. In a\nfew minutes she uttered a shrill cry. It was in a voice so strained,\nso piercing, so unlike her own, that the Senora leaped from her bed.\nAntonia turned to meet her mother with white, parted lips. She was\nspeechless with excess of feeling, but she pointed to the Alamo. The\nblack flag was no longer there! A white one was flying in its place.\n\n“IT IS A SURRENDER!” gasped Antonia. “IT IS A SURRENDER!” and, as if\nin response to her words, a mighty shout and a simultaneous salute of\nrifles hailed the emblem of victory.\n\nAn hour afterwards a little Mexican boy came running with all his speed.\nHe brought a few lines from Don Lopez. They had evidently been written\nin a great hurry, and on a piece of paper torn from his pocket-book,\nbut oh! how welcome they were. The very lack of formality gave to them a\ncertain hurry of good fortune:\n\n\n     “May you and yours be God’s care for many years to come,\n     Senora!  The Mexicans have surrendered the Alamo, and asked\n     for quarter.  These noble-minded Americans have given it.  The\n     Senor Doctor will bring you good news.  I rejoice with you.\n                                 “LOPEZ NAVARRO.”\n\n\nDeath and captivity had been turned away from their home, and the\nfirst impulse of these pious, simple-hearted women was a prayer of\nthanksgiving. Then Antonia remembered the uncomfortable state of the\nhousehold, and the probable necessities of the men coming back from\nmortal strife and the shadow of death.\n\nShe found that the news had already changed the domestic atmosphere.\nEvery servant was attending to his duty. Every one professed a great joy\nin the expected arrival of the Senor. And what a happy impetus the hope\ngave to her own hands! How delightful it was to be once more arranging\nthe evening meal, and brightening the rooms with fire and light!\n\nSoon after dark they heard the swing of the garden gate, the tramp of\nrapid footsteps, and the high-pitched voices of excited men. The door\nwas flung wide. The Senora forgot that it was cold. She went with\noutstretched arms to meet her husband. Dare and Luis were with him.\nThey were black with the smoke of battle. Their clothing was torn and\nbloodstained; the awful light of the fierce struggle was still upon\ntheir faces. But they walked like heroes, and the glory of the deeds\nthey had done crowned with its humanity, made them appear to the women\nthat loved them but a little lower than the angels.\n\nDoctor Worth held his wife close to his heart and kissed her tears of\njoy away, and murmured upon her lips the tenderest words a woman ever\nhears--the words a man never perfectly learns till he has loved his wife\nthrough a quarter of a century of change, and sorrow, and anxiety.\nAnd what could Antonia give Dare but the embrace, the kiss, the sweet\nwhispers of love and pride, which were the spontaneous outcome of both\nhearts?\n\nThere was a moment’s hesitation on the part of Luis and Isabel. The\ntraditions of caste and country, the social bonds of centuries, held\nthem. But Isabel snapped them asunder. She looked at Luis. His eyes were\nalight with love for her, his handsome face was transfigured with the\nnobility of the emotions that possessed him. In spite of his disordered\ndress, he was incomparably handsome. When he said, “Angel mio!” and bent\nto kiss her hand, she lifted her lovely face to his, she put her arms\naround his neck, she cried softly on his breast, whispering sweet little\ndiminutives of affection and pride. Such hours as followed are very rare\nin this life; and they are nearly always bought with a great price--paid\nfor in advance with sorrow and anxiety, or earned by such faithful\nwatching and patient waiting as touches the very citadel of life.\n\nThe men were hungry; they had eaten nothing all day. How delicious was\ntheir meal! How happy and merry it made the Senora, and Antonia, and\nIsabel, to see them empty dish after dish; to see their unaffected\nenjoyment of the warm room, and bright fire, of their after-dinner\ncoffee and tobacco. There was only one drawback to the joy of the\nreunion--the absence of Jack.\n\n“His disappointment will be greater than ours,” said Jack’s father. “To\nbe present at the freeing of his native city, and to bring his first\nlaurels to his mother, was the brightest dream Jack had. But Jack is a\nfine rider, and is not a very fine marksman; so it was decided to send\nhim with Houston to the Convention. We expected him back before the\nattack on the city began. Indeed, we were waiting for orders from the\nConvention to undertake it.”\n\n“Then you fought without orders, father?”\n\n“Well, yes, Antonia--in a way. Delays in war are as dangerous as in\nlove. We were surrounded by dragoons, who scoured the country in every\ndirection to prevent our foraging. San Antonio HAD to be taken. Soon\ndone was well done. On the third of December Colonel Milam stepped in\nfront of the ranks, and asked if two hundred of the men would go with\nhim and storm the city. The whole eleven hundred stepped forward, and\ngave him their hands and their word. From them two hundred of the finest\nmarksmen were selected.”\n\n“I have to say that was a great scene, mi Roberto.”\n\n“The greater for its calmness, I think. There was no shouting, no\nhurrahing, no obvious enthusiasm. It was the simple assertion of serious\nmen determined to carry out their object.”\n\n“And you stormed San Antonio with two hundred men, father?”\n\n“But every man was a picked man. A Mexican could not show his head above\nthe ramparts and live. We had no powder and ball to waste; and I doubt\nif a single ball missed its aim.”\n\n“A Mexican is like a Highland Scot in one respect,” said Dare; “he\nfights best with steel. They are good cavalry soldiers.”\n\n“There are no finer cavalry in the world than the horsemen from Santa\nFe, Dare. But with powder and ball Mexicans trust entirely to luck; and\nluck is nowhere against Kentucky sharpshooters. Their balls very seldom\nreached us, though we were close to the ramparts; and we gathered them\nup by thousands, and sent them back with our double-Dupont powder. THEN\nthey did damage enough. In fact, we have taken the Alamo with Mexican\nballs.”\n\n“Under what flag did you fight, Roberto?”\n\n“Under the Mexican republican flag of eighteen twenty-four; but indeed,\nMaria, I do not think we had one in the camp. We were destitute of\nall the trappings of war--we had no uniforms, no music, no flags, no\npositive military discipline. But we had one heart and mind, and one\nobject in view; and this four days’ fight has shown what men can do, who\nare moved by a single, grand idea.”\n\nThe Senora lay upon a sofa; the doctor sat by her side. Gradually their\nconversation became more low and confidential. They talked of their\nsons, and their probable whereabouts; of all that the Senora and her\ndaughters had suffered from the disaffection of the servants; and the\nattitude taken by Fray Ignatius. And the doctor noticed, without much\nsurprise, that his wife’s political sympathies were still in a state of\ntransition and uncertainty. She could not avoid prophesying the speedy\nand frightful vengeance of Mexico. She treated the success at San\nAntonio as one of the accidents of war. She looked forward to an early\nrenewal of hostilities.\n\n“My countrymen are known to me, Roberto,” she said, with a touch that\nwas almost a hope of vengeance. “They have an insurmountable honor; they\nwill revenge this insult to it in some terrible way. If the gracious\nMaria holds not the hands of Santa Anna, he will utterly destroy the\nAmericans! He will be like a tiger that has become mad.”\n\n“I am not so much afraid of Santa Anna as of Fray Ignatius. Promise me,\nmy dear Maria, that you will not suffer yourself or your children to be\ndecoyed by him into a convent. I should never see you again.”\n\nThe discussion on this subject was long and eager. Antonia, talking\nwith Dare a little apart, could not help hearing it and feeling great\ninterest in her father’s entreaties, even though she was discussing\nwith Dare the plans for their future. For Dare had much to tell his\nbetrothed. During the siege, the doctor had discovered that his intended\nson-in-law was a fine surgeon. Dare had, with great delicacy, been quite\nreticent on this subject, until circumstances made his assistance a\nmatter of life and death; and the doctor understood and appreciated the\nyoung man’s silence.\n\n“He thinks I might have a touch of professional jealousy--he thinks I\nmight suspect him of wanting a partnership as well as a wife; he wishes\nto take his full share of the dangers of war, without getting behind the\nshield of his profession”; these feelings the doctor understood, and he\npassed from Fray Ignatius to this pleasanter topic, gladly.\n\nHe told the Senora what a noble son they were going to have; he said,\n“when the war is over, Maria, my dear, he shall marry Antonia.”\n\n“And what do you say, Roberto, if I should give them the fine house on\nthe Plaza that my brother Perfecto left me?”\n\n“If you do that you will be the best mother in the world, Maria. I\nthen will take Dare into partnership. He is good and clever; and I am a\nlittle weary of work. I shall enjoy coming home earlier to you. We will\ngo riding and walking, and our courting days will begin again.”\n\n“Maria Santissima! How delightful that will be, Roberto! And as for our\nIsabel, shall we not make her happy also? Luis should have done as\nhis own family have done; a young man to go against his mother and his\nuncles, that is very wicked! but, if we forgive that fault, well, then,\nLuis is as good as good bread.”\n\n“I think so. He began the study of the law. He must finish it. He must\nlearn the American laws also. I am not a poor man, Maria. I will give\nIsabel the fortune worthy of a Yturbide or a Flores--a fortune that will\nmake her very welcome to the Alvedas.”\n\nThe Senora clasped her husband’s hand with a smile. They were sweetening\ntheir own happiness with making the happiness of their children. They\nlooked first at Antonia. She sat with Dare, earnestly talking to him in\na low voice. Dare clasped in his own the dear little hand that had been\npromised to him. Antonia bent toward her lover; her fair head rested\nagainst his shoulder. Isabel sat in a large chair, and Luis leaned on\nthe back of it, stooping his bright face to the lovely one which\nwas sometimes dropped to hide her blushes, and sometimes lifted with\nflashing eyes to answer his tender words.\n\n“My happiness is so great, Roberto, I am even tired of being happy. Call\nRachela. I must go to sleep. To-night I cannot even say an ave.”\n\n“God hears the unspoken prayer in your heart, Maria; and to-night let me\nhelp you upstairs. My arm is stronger than Rachela’s.”\n\nShe rose with a little affectation of greater weakness and lassitude\nthan she really felt. But she wished to be weak, so that her Roberto\nmight be strong--to be quite dependent on his care and tenderness. And\nshe let her daughters embrace her so prettily, and then offered her hand\nto Dare and Luis with so much grace and true kindness that both young\nmen were enchanted.\n\n“It is to be seen that they are gentlemen,” she said, as she went slowly\nupstairs on her husband’s arm--“and hark! that is the singing of Luis.\nWhat is it he says?” They stood still to listen. Clear and sweet\nwere the chords of the mandolin, and melodiously to them Luis was\nprotesting--\n\n        “Freedom shall have our shining blades!\n         Our hearts are yours, fair Texan maids!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. THE DOCTOR AND THE PRIEST.\n\n        “I tell thee, priest, if the world were wise\n         They would not wag one finger in your quarrels:\n         Your heaven you promise, but our earth you covet;\n         The Phaetons of mankind, who fire the world\n         Which you were sent by preaching but to warm.”\n\n         Your Saviour came not with a gaudy show,\n         Nor was His kingdom of the world below:\n         The crown He wore was of the pointed thorn\n         In purple He was crucified, not born.\n         They who contend for place and high degree\n         Are not His sons, but those of Zebedee.”\n                                 --DRYDEN.\n\nThe exalted state of mind which the victorious men had brought home with\nthem did not vanish with sleep. The same heroic atmosphere was in the\nhouse in the morning. Antonia’s face had a brightness upon it that never\nyet was the result of mere flesh and blood. When she came into the usual\nsitting-room, Dare was already there; indeed, he had risen purposely for\nthis hour. Their smiles and glances met each other with an instantaneous\nunderstanding. It was the old Greek greeting “REJOICE!” without the\naudible expression.\n\nNever again, perhaps, in all their lives would moments so full of\nsweetness and splendor come to them. They were all the sweeter because\nblended with the homely duties that fell to Antonia’s hands. As she went\nabout ordering the breakfast, and giving to the table a festal air, Dare\nthought of the old Homeric heroes, and the daughters of the kings who\nministered to their wants. The bravest of them had done no greater deeds\nof personal valor than had been done by the little band of American\npioneers and hunters with whom he had fought the last four days. The\nprinces among them had been welcomed by no sweeter and fairer women than\nhad welcomed his companions and himself.\n\nAnd, though his clothing was black with the smoke of the battle and torn\nwith the fray, never had Dare himself looked so handsome. There was an\nunspeakable radiance in his fair face. The close, brown curls of his\nhair; his tall figure, supple and strong; his air of youth, and valor,\nand victory; the love-light in his eyes; the hopes in his heart, made\nhim for the time really more than a mere mortal man. He walked like\nthe demi-gods he was thinking of. The most glorious ideal of life, the\nbrightest dream of love that he had ever had, found in this hour their\ncomplete realization.\n\nThe Senora did not come down; but Isabel and Luis and the doctor joined\nthe breakfast party. Luis had evidently been to see Lopez Navarro before\nhe did so; for he wore a new suit of dark blue velvet and silver, a\nsash of crimson silk, the neatest of patent leather shoes, and the most\nbeautifully embroidered linen. Dare gave him a little smile and nod of\napprobation. He had not thought of fine clothing for himself; but then\nfor the handsome, elegant, Mexican youth it seemed precisely the\nright thing. And Isabel, in her scarlet satin petticoat, and white\nembroideries and satin slippers, looked his proper mate. Dare and\nAntonia, and even the doctor, watched their almost childlike devotion to\neach other with sympathetic delight.\n\nOh, if such moments could only last! No, no; as a rule they last long\nenough. Joy wearies as well as sorrow. An abiding rapture would make\nitself a sorrow out of our very weakness to bear it. We should become\nexhausted and exacting, and be irritated by the limitations of our\nnature, and our inability to create and to endure an increasing rapture.\nIt is because joy is fugitive that it leaves us a delightsome memory.\nIt is far better, then, not to hold the rose until it withers in our\nfevered hand.\n\nThe three women watched their heroes go back to the city. The doctor\nlooked very little older than his companions. He sat his horse superbly,\nand he lifted his hat to the proud Senora with a loving grace which\nneither of the young men could excel. In that far back year, when he had\nwooed her with the sweet words she taught him, he had not looked more\nmanly and attractive. There is a perverse disposition in women to love\npersonal prowess, and to adore the heroes of the battle-field; and never\nhad the Senora loved her husband as she did at that hour.\n\nIn his capacity of physician he had done unnoticed deeds of far\ngreater bravery--gone into a Comanche camp that was being devastated\nby smallpox--or galloped fifty miles; alone in the night, through woods\nhaunted by savage men and beasts, to succor some little child struggling\nwith croup, or some frontiersman pierced with an arrow. The Senora had\nalways fretted and scolded a little when he thus exposed his life. But\nthe storming of the Alamo! That was a bravery she could understand. Her\nRoberto was indeed a hero! Though she could not bring herself to approve\nthe cause for which he fought, she was as sensitive as men and women\nalways are to victorious valor and a successful cause.\n\nRachela was in a state of rebellion. Nothing but the express orders\nof Fray Ignatius, to remain where she was, prevented her leaving the\nWorths; for the freedom so suddenly given to Isabel had filled her with\nindignation. She was longing to be in some house where she could give\nadequate expression to the diabolical temper she felt it right to\nindulge.\n\nIn the afternoon it was some relief to see the confessor coming up the\ngarden. He had resumed his usual deliberate pace. His hands were folded\nupon his breast. He looked as the mournful Jeremiah may have looked,\nwhen he had the burden of a heavy prophecy to deliver.\n\nThe Senora sat down with a doggedly sullen air, which Antonia understood\nvery well. It meant, “I am not to be forced to take any way but my own,\nto-day”; and the wise priest understood her mood as soon as he entered\nthe room. He put behind him the reproof he had been meditating. He\nstimulated her curiosity; he asked her sympathy. No man knew better than\nFray Ignatius, when to assume sacerdotal authority and when to lay it\naside.\n\nAnd the Senora was never proof against the compliment of his personal\nfriendship. The fight, as it affected himself and his brotherhood\nand the convent, was full of interest to her. She smiled at Brother\nServando’s childish alarm; she was angry at an insult offered to the\nvenerable abbot; she condoled with the Sisters, wept at the danger that\nthe famous statue of the Virgin de Los Reinedias had been exposed to;\nand was altogether as sympathetic as he could desire, until her own\naffairs were mentioned.\n\n“And you also, my daughter? The sword has pierced your heart too, I am\nsure! To know that your husband and sons were fighting against your God\nand your country! Holy Mother! How great must have been your grief. But,\nfor your comfort, I tell you that the saints who have suffered a fiery\nmartyrdom stand at the feet of those who, like you, endure the continual\ncrucifixion of their affections.”\n\nThe Senora was silent, but not displeased and the priest then ventured a\nlittle further:\n\n“But there is an end to all trials, daughter and I now absolve you from\nthe further struggle. Decide this day for your God and your country.\nMake an offering to Almighty God and the Holy Mother of your earthly\nlove. Give yourself and your daughters and all that you have to the\nbenign and merciful Church. Show these rebels and heretics--these\nungrateful recipients of Mexican bounty--what a true Catholic is capable\nof. His Divine Majesty and the Holy Mary demand this supreme sacrifice\nfrom you.”\n\n“Father, I have my husband, and my sons; to them, also, I owe some\nduties.”\n\n“The Church will absolve you from them.”\n\n“It would break my heart.”\n\n“Listen then: If it is your right hand, or your right eye--that is, if\nit is your husband, or your child--you are commanded to give them up;\nor--it is God’s word--there is only hell fire.”\n\n“Mother of Sorrows, pity me! What shall I do?”\n\nShe looked with the terror of a child into the dark, cruel face of the\npriest. It was as immovably stern as if carved out of stone. Then her\neyes sought those of Antonia, who sat at a distant window with her\nembroidery in her hand. She let it fall when her mother’s pitiful,\nuncertain glance asked from her strength and counsel. She rose and\nwent to her. Never had the tall, fair girl looked so noble. A sorrowful\nmajesty, that had something in it of pity and something of anger,\ngave to her countenance, her movements, and even her speech, a kind of\nauthority.\n\n“Dear mother, do as the beloved and kindhearted Ruth did. Like you, she\nmarried one not of her race and not of her religion. Even when God had\ntaken him from her, she chose to remain with his people--to leave her\nown people and abide with his mother. For this act God blessed her, and\nall nations in all ages have honored her.”\n\n“Ruth! Ruth! Ruth! What has Ruth to do with the question? Presumptuous\none! Ruth was a heathen woman--a Moabite--a race ten times accursed.”\n\n“Pardon, father. Ruth was the ancestress of our blessed Saviour, and of\nthe Virgin Mary.”\n\n“Believe not the wicked one, Senora? She is blinded with false\nknowledge. She is a heretic. I have long suspected it. She has not been\nto confession for nine months.”\n\n“You wrong me, father. Every day, twice a day, I confess my sins\nhumbly.”\n\n“Chito! You are in outrageous sin. But, then, what else? I hear, indeed,\nthat you read wicked books--even upon your knees you read them.”\n\n“I read my Bible, father.”\n\n“Bring it to me. How could a child like you read the Bible? It is a book\nfor bishops and archbishops, and the Immaculate Father himself. What\nan arrogance? What an insolence of self-conceit must possess so young a\nheart? Saints of God! It confounds me.”\n\nThe girl stood with burning cheeks gazing at the proud, passionate man,\nbut she did not obey his order.\n\n“Senora, my daughter! See you with your own eyes the fruit of your sin.\nWill you dare to become a partner in such wickedness?”\n\n“Antonia! Antonia! Go at once and bring here this wicked book. Oh, how\ncan you make so miserable a mother who loves you so much?”\n\nIn a few moments Antonia returned with the objectionable book. “My dear\ngrandmother gave it to me,” she said. “Look, mi madre, here is my name\nin her writing. Is it conceivable that she would give to your Antonia a\nbook that she ought not to read?”\n\nThe Senora took it in her hands and turned the leaves very much as a\nchild might turn those of a book in an unknown tongue, in which there\nwere no illustrations nor anything that looked the least interesting.\nIt was a pretty volume of moderate size, bound in purple morocco, and\nfastened with gilt clasps.\n\n“I see the word GOD in it very often, Fray Ignatius. Perhaps, indeed, it\nis not bad.”\n\n“It is a heretic Bible, I am sure. Could anything be more sinful, more\ndisrespectful to God, more dangerous for a young girl?” and as he said\nthe words he took it from the Senora’s listless hands, glanced at the\nobnoxious title-page, and then, stepping hastily to the hearth, flung\nthe book upon the burning logs.\n\nWith a cry of horror, pain, amazement, all blended, Antonia sprang\ntowards the fire, but Fray Ignatius stood with outstretched arms, before\nit.\n\n“Stand back!” he cried. “To save your soul from eternal fires, I burn\nthe book that has misled you!”\n\n“Oh, my Bible! Oh, my Bible! Oh, mother! mother!” and sobbing and crying\nout in her fear and anger, she fled down stairs and called the peon\nOrtiz.\n\n“Do you know where to find the Senor Doctor? If you do, Ortiz, take the\nswiftest horse and bring him here.”\n\nThe man looked with anger into the girl’s troubled face. For a moment\nhe was something unlike himself. “I can find him; I will bring him in\nfifteen minutes. Corpus Christi it is here he should be.”\n\nThe saddled horse in the stable was mounted as he muttered one\nadjuration and oath after another, and Antonia sat down at the window\nto watch for the result of her message. Fortunately, Rachela had been so\ninterested in the proceedings, and so determined to know all about\nthem, that she seized the opportunity of the outcry to fly to “her\npoor Senora,” and thus was ignorant of the most unusual step taken by\nAntonia.\n\nIndeed, no one was aware of it but herself and Ortiz; and the servants\nin the kitchen looked with a curious interest at the doctor riding into\nthe stable yard as if his life depended upon his speed. Perhaps it did.\nAll of them stopped their work to speculate upon the circumstance.\n\nThey saw him fling himself from the saddle they saw Antonia run to meet\nhim; they heard her voice full of distress--they knew it was the voice\nof complaint. They were aware it was answered by a stamp on the flagged\nhall of the doctor’s iron-heeled boot--which rang through the whole\nhouse, and which was but the accompaniment of the fierce exclamation\nthat went with it.\n\nThey heard them mount the stairs together, and then they were left to\ntheir imaginations. As for Antonia, she was almost terrified at the\nstorm she had raised. Never had she seen anger so terrible. Yet, though\nhe had not said a word directly to her, she was aware of his full\nsympathy. He grasped her hand, and entered the Senora’s room with her.\nHis first order was to Rachela--\n\n“Leave the house in five minutes; no, in three minutes. I will tell\nOrtiz to send your clothes after you. Go!”\n\n“My Senora! Fray I--”\n\n“Go!” he thundered. “Out of my house! Fly! I will not endure you another\nmoment.”\n\nThe impetus of his words was like a great wind. They drove the woman\nbefore him, and he shut the door behind her with a terrifying and\namazing rage. Then he turned to the priest--\n\n“Fray Ignatius, you have abused my hospitality, and my patience.\nYou shall do so no longer. For twenty-six years I have suffered your\ninterference-”\n\n“The Senor is a prudent man. The wise bear what they cannot resist”; and\nwith a gentle smile and lifted eyebrows Fray Ignatius crossed himself.\n\n“I have respected your faith, though it was the faith of a bigot; and\nyour opinions, though they were false and cruel, because you believed\nhonestly in them. But you shall not again interfere with my wife, or my\nchildren, or my servants, or my house.”\n\n“The Senor Doctor is not prince, or pope. ‘Shall,’ and ‘SHALL NOT,’ no\none but my own ecclesiastical superiors can say to me.”\n\n“I say, you shall not again terrify my wife and insult my daughter, and\ndisorganize my whole household! And, as the God of my mother hears me,\nyou shall not again burn up His Holy Word under my roof. Never, while\nI dwell beneath it, enter my gates, or cross my threshold, or address\nyourself to any that bear my name, or eat my bread.” With the words, he\nwalked to the door and held it open. It was impossible to mistake\nthe unspoken order, and there was something in the concentrated yet\ncontrolled passion of Robert Worth which even the haughty priest did not\ncare to irritate beyond its bounds.\n\nHe gathered his robe together, and with lifted eyes muttered an\nejaculatory prayer. Then he said in slow, cold, precise tones:\n\n“For the present, I go. Very good. I shall come back again. The saints\nwill take care of that. Senora, I give you my blessing. Senor, you may\nyet find the curse of a poor priest an inconvenience.”\n\nHe crossed himself at the door, and cast a last look at the Senora, who\nhad thrown herself upon her knees, and was crying out to Mary and the\nsaints in a passion of excuses and reproaches. She was deaf to all her\nhusband said. She would not suffer Antonia to approach her. She felt\nthat now was the hour of her supreme trial. She had tolerated the\nrebellion of her husband, and her sons, and her daughter, and now she\nwas justly punished. They had driven away from her the confessor, and\nthe maid who had been her counsellor and her reliance from her girlhood.\n\nHer grief and terror were genuine, and therefore pitiful; and, in spite\nof his annoyance, the doctor recognized the fact. In a moment, as soon\nas they were alone, he put aside his anger. He knelt beside her,\nhe soothed her with tender words, he pleaded the justice of his\nindignation. And ere long she began to listen to his excuses, and to\ncomplain to him:\n\nHe had been born a heretic, and therefore might be excused a little,\neven by Almighty God. But Antonia! Her sin was beyond endurance. She\nherself, and the good Sisters, and Fray Ignatius, had all taught her in\nher infancy the true religion. And her Roberto must see that this was\na holy war--a war for the Holy Catholic Church. No wonder Fray Ignatius\nwas angry.\n\n“My dear Maria, every church thinks itself right; and all other churches\nwrong. God looks at the heart. If it is right, it makes all worship\ntrue. But when the Americans have won Texas, they will give to every one\nfreedom to worship God as they wish.”\n\n“Saints in heaven, Roberto! That day comes not. One victory! Bah! That\nis an accident. The Mexicans are a very brave people,--the bravest in\nthe world. Did they not drive the Spaniards out of their country; and\nit is not to be contradicted that the Spaniards have conquered all other\nnations. That I saw in a book. The insult the Americans have given\nto Mexico will be revenged. Her honor has been compromised before the\nworld. Very well, it will be made bright again; yes, Fray Ignatius says\nwith blood and fire it will be made bright.”\n\n“And in the mean time, Maria, we have taken from them the city they love\nbest of all. An hour ago I saw, General Cos, with eleven hundred Mexican\nsoldiers, pass before a little band of less than two hundred Americans\nand lay down their arms. These defenders of the Alamo had all been\nblessed by the priests. Their banners had been anointed with holy oil\nand holy water. They had all received absolution everyday before the\nfight began; they had been promised a free passage through purgatory and\na triumphant entry into heaven.”\n\n“Well, I will tell you something; Fray Ignatius showed it to me--it was\na paper printed. The rebels and their wives and children are to be sent\nfrom this earth--you may know where they will all go, Roberto--Congress\nsays so. The States will give their treasures. The archbishops will\ngive the episcopal treasures. The convents will give their gems and gold\nornaments. Ten thousand men had left for San Antonio, and ten thousand\nmore are to follow; the whole under our great President Santa Anna. Oh,\nyes! The rebels in Washington are to be punished also. It is well known\nthat they sent soldiers to Nacogdoches. Mexicans are not blind moles,\nand they have their intelligence, you know. All the States who have\nhelped these outrageous ingrates are to be devastated, and you will see\nthat your famous Washington will be turned into a heap of stories. I\nhave seen these words in print, Roberto. I assure you, that it is not\njust a little breath--what one or another says--it is the printed orders\nof the Mexican government. That is something these Americans will have\nto pay attention to.”\n\nThe doctor sighed, and answered the sorrowful, credulous woman with a\nkiss. What was the use of reasoning with simplicity so ignorant and so\nconfident? He turned the conversation to a subject that always roused\nher best and kindest feelings--her son Jack.\n\n“I have just seen young Dewees, Maria. He and Jack left San Felipe\ntogether. Dewees brought instructions to General Burleson; and Jack\ncarried others to Fannin, at Goliad.”\n\nShe took her husband’s hands and kissed them. “That indeed! Oh, Roberto!\nIf I could only see my Jack once more! I have had a constant accusation\nto bear about him. Till I kiss my boy again, the world will be all dark\nbefore my face. If Our Lady will grant me this miraculous favor, I will\nalways afterwards be exceedingly religious. I will give all my desires\nto the other world.”\n\n“Dearest Maria, God did not put us in this world to be always desiring\nanother. There is no need, mi queridita, to give up this life as a bad\naffair. We shall be very happy again, soon.\n\n“As you say. If I could only see Jack! For that, I would promise God\nAlmighty and you Roberto to be happy. I would forgive the rebels and the\nheretics--for they are well acquainted with hell road, and will guide\neach other there without my wish.”\n\n“I am sure if Jack has one day he will come to you. And when he hears of\nthe surrender of General Cos--”\n\n“Well now, it was God’s will that General Cos should surrender. What\nmore can be said? It is sufficient.”\n\n“Let me call Antonia. She is miserable at your displeasure; and it is\nnot Antonia’s fault.”\n\n“Pardon me, Roberto. I have seen Antonia. She is not agreeable and\nobedient to Fray Ignatius.”\n\n“She has been very wickedly used by him; and I fear he intends to do her\nevil.”\n\n“It is not convenient to discuss the subject now. I will see Isabel;\nshe is a good child--my only comfort. Paciencia! there is Luis Alveda\nsinging; Isabel will now be deaf to all else”; and she rose with a sigh\nand walked towards the casement looking into the garden.\n\nLuis was coming up the oleander walk. The pretty trees were thinner now,\nand had only a pink blossom here and there. But the bright winter sun\nshone through them, and fell upon Luis and Isabel. For she had also seen\nhim coming, and had gone to meet him, with a little rainbow-tinted shawl\nover her head. She looked so piquant and so happy. She seemed such a\nproper mate for the handsome youth at her side that a word of dissent\nwas not possible. The doctor said only, “She is so like you, Maria. I\nremember when you were still more lovely, and when from your balcony you\nmade me with a smile the happiest man in the world.”\n\nSuch words were never lost ones; for the Senora had a true and great\nlove for her husband. She gave him again a smile, she put her hand in\nhis, and then there were no further conciliations required. They stood\nin the sunshine of their own hearts, and listened a moment to the gay\nyouth, singing, how at--\n\n                The strong old Alamo\n        Two hundred men, with rifles true,\n        Shot down a thousand of the foe,\n        And broke the triple ramparts through;\n        And dropped the flag as black as night,\n        For Freedom’s green and red and white.[3]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. A HAPPY TRUCE.\n\n        “Well, honor is the subject of my story;\n         I cannot tell what you and other men\n         Think of this life; but for my single self,\n         I had as lief not be, as live to be\n         In awe of such a thing as I myself.”\n\n        “Two truths are told\n         As happy prologues to the swelling act,\n         Of the imperial theme.”\n\n        “This is the eve of Christmas,\n         No sleep from night to morn;\n         The Virgin is in travail,\n         At twelve will the Child be born.”\n\nCities have not only a certain physiognomy; they have also a decided\nmental and moral character, and a definite political tendency. There\nare good and bad cities, artistic and commercial cities, scholarly and\nmanufacturing cities, aristocratic and radical cities. San Antonio, in\nits political and social character, was a thoroughly radical city.\nIts population, composed in a large measure of adventurous units from\nvarious nationalities, had that fluid rather than fixed character, which\nis susceptible to new ideas. For they were generally men who had found\nthe restraints of the centuries behind them to be intolerable--men to\nwhom freedom was the grand ideal of life.\n\nIt maybe easily undertood{sic} that this element in the population of\nSan Antonio was a powerful one, and that a little of such leaven would\nstir into activity a people who, beneath the crust of their formal\npiety, had still something left of that pride and adventurous spirit\nwhich distinguished the Spain of Ferdinand and Isabel.\n\nIn fact, no city on the American continent has such a bloody record as\nSan Antonio. From its settlement by the warlike monks of 1692, to its\nfinal capture by the Americans in 1836, it was well named “the city of\nthe sword.” The Comanche and the white man fought around its walls their\nforty years’ battle for supremacy. From 1810 to 1821 its streets were\nconstantly bloody with the fight between the royalists and republicans,\nand the city and the citadel passed from, one party to the other\ncontinually. And when it came to the question of freedom and American\ndomination, San Antonio was, as it had ever been, the great Texan\nbattle-field.\n\nIts citizens then were well used to the fortunes and changes of war. Men\nwere living who had seen the horrors of the auto da fe and the\nsplendors of viceregal authority. Insurgent nobles, fighting priests,\nrevolutionizing Americans, all sorts and conditions of men, all chances\nand changes of religious and military power, had ruled it with a\ntemporary absolutism during their generation.\n\nIn the main there was a favorable feeling regarding its occupation by\nthe Americans. The most lawless of them were law-abiding in comparison\nwith any kind of victorious Mexicans. Americans protected private\nproperty, they honored women, they observed the sanctity of every man’s\nhome; “and, as for being heretics, that was an affair for the saints and\nthe priests; the comfortable benefits of the Holy Catholic Church, had\nnot been vouchsafed to all nations.”\n\nPolitical changes are favorable to religious tolerance, and the priests\nthemselves had been sensible of a great decrease in their influence\nduring the pending struggle. Prominent Mexicans had given aid and\ncomfort to the Americans in spite of their spiritual orders, and there\nwere many men who, like Lopez Navarro, did not dare to go to confession,\nbecause they would have been compelled to acknowledge themselves rebels.\n\nWhen the doctor and Dare and Luis reached the Plaza, the morning after\nthe surrender, they found the city already astir. Thousands of women\nwere in the churches saying masses for the dead; the men stood at\ntheir store doors or sat smoking on their balconies, chatting with the\npassers-by or watching the movements of the victorious army and the\nevacuation of the conquered one.\n\nNearly all of the brave two hundred occupied the Plaza. They were still\ngreatly excited by the miraculous ecstacy of victory. But when soldiers\nin the death-pang rejoice under its influence, what wonder that the\nliving feel its intoxicating rapture? They talked and walked as if they\nalready walked the streets of Mexico. All things seemed possible to\nthem. The royalty of their carriage, the authority in their faces, gave\ndignity even to their deerskin clothing. Its primitive character was\nits distinction, and the wearers looked like the demi-gods of the heroic\nstage of history.\n\nLopez Navarro touched the doctor and directed his attention to them.\n“Does the world, Senor, contain the stuff to make their counterparts?”\n\n“They are Americans, Navarro. And though there are a variety of\nAmericans, they have only one opinion about submitting to tyrants--THEY\nWON’T DO IT!”\n\nThis was the conversation interrupted by Ortiz and the message he\nbrought, and the doctor was thoroughly sobered by the events following.\nHe was not inclined to believe, as the majority of the troops did, that\nMexico was conquered. He expected that the Senora’s prediction would\nbe verified. And the personal enmity which the priesthood felt to him\ninduced a depressing sense of personal disaster.\n\nNothing in the house or the city seemed inclined to settle. It took a\nfew days to draw up the articles of capitulation and clear the town\nof General Cos and the Mexican troops. And he had no faith in their\nagreement to “retire from Texas, and never again carry arms against the\nAmericans.” He knew that they did not consider it any sin to make “a\nmental reservation” against a heretic. He was quite sure that if Cos met\nreinforcements, he would have to be fought over again immediately.\n\nAnd amid these public cares and considerations, he had serious private\nones. The Senora was still under the control of Fray Ignatius. It\nrequired all the influence of his own personal presence and affection\nto break the spiritual captivity in which he held her. He knew that the\npriest had long been his enemy.\n\nHe saw that Antonia was hated by him. He was in the shadow of a terror\nworse than death--that of a long, hopeless captivity. A dungeon and\na convent might become to them a living grave, in which cruelty and\ndespair would slowly gnaw life away.\n\nAnd yet, for a day or two he resolved not to speak of his terror. The\nSenora was so happy in his presence, and she had such kind confidences\nto give him about her plans for her children’s future, that he could\nnot bear to alarm her. And the children also were so full of youth’s\nenthusiasms and love’s sweet dreams. Till the last moment why should\nhe awaken them? And as the strongest mental element in a home gives the\ntone to it, so Dare and Antonia, with the doctor behind them, gave to\nthe Mexican household almost an American freedom of intercourse and\ncommunity of pleasure.\n\nThe Senora came to the parlor far more frequently, and in her own\napartments her children visited her with but slight ceremony. They\ndiscussed all together their future plans. They talked over a wonderful\njourney which they were to take in company to New Orleans, and\nWashington, and New York, and perhaps even to London and Paris--“who\ncould tell, if the Senora would be so good as to enjoy herself?” They\nate more together. They got into the habit of congregating about the\nsame hearthstone. It was the Senora’s first real experience of domestic\nlife.\n\nIn about six days the Mexican forces left the city. The terms of\nsurrender granted General Cos struck the Mexicans with a kind of wonder.\nThey had fought with the express declaration that they would take no\nAmerican prisoner. Yet the Americans not only permitted Cos and his\ntroops to leave under parole of honor, but gave them their arms and\nsufficient ammunition to protect themselves from the Indians on their\njourney home. They allowed them also all their private property. They\nfurnished them with the provisions necessary to reach the Rio Grande.\nThey took charge of their sick and wounded. They set all the Mexican\nprisoners at liberty--in short, so great was their generosity and\ncourtesy that the Mexicans were unable to comprehend their motives.\n\nEven Lopez was troubled at it. “I assure you,” he said to Dr. Worth,\n“they will despise such civility; they will not believe in its\nsincerity. At this very blessed hour of God, they are accusing the\nAmericans of being afraid to press their advantage. Simply, you will\nhave the fight to make over again. I say this, because I know Santa\nAnna.”\n\n“Santa Anna is but a man, Lopez.”\n\n“Me perdonas! He is however a man who knows a trick more than the devil.\nOne must be careful of a bull in front, of a mule behind, and of a\nmonk and Santa Anna on all sides. At the word monk, Lopez glanced\nsignificantly at a passing priest, and Doctor Worth saw that it was Fray\nIgnatius.\n\n“He sprinkled the Mexican troops with holy water, and blessed them as\nthey left the city this morning. He has the ear of General Cos. He is\nnot a man to offend, I assure you, Doctor.”\n\nThe doctor walked thoughtfully away. San Antonio was full of his\nfriends, yet never had he felt himself and his family to be in so much\ndanger. And the words of Lopez had struck a responding chord in his\nown consciousness. The careless bravery, the splendid generosity of\nhis countrymen was at least premature. He went through the city with\nobserving eyes, and saw much to trouble him.\n\nThe gates of Alamo were open. Crockett lounged upon his rifle in the\nPlaza. A little crowd was around him, and the big Tennesseean hunter was\ntalking to them. Shouts of laughter, bravas of enthusiasm, answered the\nhomely wit and stirring periods that had over and over “made room for\nColonel Crockett,” both in the Tennessee Legislature and the United\nStates Congress. His rifle seemed a part of him--a kind of third arm.\nHis confident manner, his manliness and bravery, turned his wit into\nwisdom. The young fellows around found in him their typical leader.\n\nThe elegant James Bowie was sitting on the verandah of the Veramendi\nHouse, calmly smoking. His fair, handsome face, clear blue eyes and\nmild manners, gave no indication of the gigantic physical strength and\ntremendous coolness and courage of the man who never tolerated an enemy\nin his presence. Burleson and Travis were talking under the shade of a\nChina tree, and there were little groups of American soldiers on every\nstreet; this was what he saw, and yet a terrible sense of insecurity\noppressed him.\n\nThe city, moreover, was not settling to its usual business, though there\nwere many preparations for public and private entertainments. After\npassing Colonel Bowie, he met David Burnett. The shrewd statesman from\nNew Jersey had a shadow upon his face. He stopped Doctor Worth and spoke\nfrankly to him. “We are in greater danger now than when we were under\nfire,” he said. “Santa Anna will come on us like a lion from the\nswellings of Jordan. I wish Houston knew our position as it really is.\nWe must either have more men to defend this city or we must blow up the\nAlamo and be ready to leave it at a moment’s notice.”\n\n“Why were such favorable terms given to General Cos and his troops? I\ncannot understand it.”\n\n“I will tell you an amazing fact. When Cos ran up that white flag on the\nAlamo, we had not a single round of ammunition left; complaisance\nwas necessary until Cos made over to us the Mexican arms, ammunition,\nproperty and money.”\n\nWorth turned and looked at the fort. A great red flag on which was the\nword T-E-X-A-S floated from its battlements, and there were two men\nstanding on its roof, with their faces westward.\n\n“They are the lookouts,” said Burnett, “and we have scouts through the\nsurrounding country; but Santa Anna will come, when he comes, with tens\nof thousands.”\n\n“And there is a line where even the coolest courage and the most\nbrilliant bravery succumbs to mere numbers--Eh!”\n\n“That is what I mean, Doctor.”\n\n“Where is Houston?”\n\n“On the Brazos, at the small town of Washington. The council have\nestablished headquarters there.”\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the ringing of a little bell, and\nthe doleful supplications of a priest followed by a crowd of idle men\nand women. He was begging, “for the sake of the Holy Virgin,” alms to\nsay masses for the soul of an unfortunate, who had not left a peso\nfor his burial. He droned on, and no one noticed him until James Bowie\nstretched his tall figure, sauntered up to the monk and dropped a gold\npiece into his cap. He did not stay to hear the exclamations and the\ngracias, but with steps that rang like metal upon metal took his way to\nthe Alamo.\n\nHowever, dangers postponed make the most timorous indifferent to them;\nand when General Cos did not return, and nothing was heard of Santa\nAnna, every one began to take up their ordinary life again. The temper\nof the Americans also encouraged this disposition. They were discovered\nneither to be bloodthirsty nor cannibals. It was even seen that they\nenjoyed the fandango and the monte tables, and that a proposition for a\nbullfight at Christmas was not opposed by them.\n\nAnd in spite of all anxieties, there were many sweet and unusual\npleasures in the Worth home. The discipline of the troops was so lenient\nthat Dare and Luis--one or both--were generally there in the evenings.\nTheir turns as scouts or watchman at the Alamo only made more delightful\nthe hours when they were exempted from these duties. As for the doctor,\nhe had been released from all obligations but those pertaining to his\nprofession, and Antonia, noticed that he spent every hour he could spare\nwith the Senora. For some reason, he appeared determined to strengthen\nhis influence over her.\n\nOn Christmas Eve the old city was very gay. The churches were decorated,\nand splendidly dressed men and women passed in and out with smiles and\ncongratulations. The fandangoes and the gambling houses were all open.\nFrom the huertas around, great numbers of families had come to receive\nabsolution and keep the Nativity. Their rich clothing and air of\nidleness gave a holiday feeling to the streets noisy with the buzzing\nof the guitar, the metallic throb of the cithara, the murmurs of voices,\nand the cries of the hawkers. Priests, Mexicans, Indians and Americans\ntouched each other on the narrow thoroughfares, but that indescribable\nfeeling of good will which comes with Christmas pervaded the atmosphere,\nand gave, even in the midst of war and danger, a sense of anticipated\npleasure.\n\nAt the Worth residence there was a household feast. The Senora and her\ndaughters were in full dress. They were waiting for the dear ones who\nhad promised to join them at the Angelus. One by one the houses around\nwere illuminated. Parties of simple musicians began to pass each other\ncontinually--they were going to serenade the blessed Mary all night\nlong. As Antonia closed the balcony window, half a dozen of these\nyoung boys passed the garden hedge singing to the clacking of their\ncastanets--\n\n        “This is the eve of Christmas,\n         No sleep from night to morn,\n         The Virgin is in travail,\n         At twelve will the Child be born.”\n\nLuis appeared at the same moment. He caught up the wild melody and came\nup the garden path singing it. Dare and the doctor followed him. It\nstruck Antonia that they were talking of a change, or of something\nimportant. But there was no time for observation. Isabel, radiant in\ncrimson satin, with her white mantilla over her head, darted forward to\nmeet Luis, and turned his song to the Virgin into a little adulation\nfor herself. Dare and the doctor took Antonia’s hands, and there was\nsomething in the silent clasp of each which made her heart tremble.\n\nBut she was not one of those foolish women who enquire after misfortune.\nShe could wait and let the evil news find her, and by so doing she won\nmany a bright hour from the advancing shadows. The Senora was in unusual\nspirits. She had obtained a new confessor. “A man of the most seraphic\nmind, and, moreover, so fortunate as to be connected with the house of\nFlores.” He had been gentle to her in the matter of penances, and not\nset her religious obligations above her capacities. Consequently,\nthe Senora had laid aside her penitential garments. She was in full\nCastilian costume, and looked very handsome. But Antonia, who had\nbeen in New York during those years when she would otherwise have been\nlearning how to wear a mantilla and use a fan, did not attempt such\ndifficulties of the toilet. She knew that she would look unnatural in\nthem, and she adhered to the American fashions of her day. But in\na plain frock of dark satin trimmed with minever bands, she looked\nexceedingly noble and lovely.\n\nThe meal was a very merry one, and after it Lopez Navarro joined the\nparty and they had music and dancing, and finally gathered around the\nfire to hear the singing of Luis. He knew a great many of the serenades,\nand as he sang of the Virgin and the Babe, a sweeter peace, a more\nsolemn joy, came to each heart. It was like bringing something of the\nbliss of heaven into the bliss of earth. The Senora’s eyes were full of\ntears; she slipped her hand into her husband’s and looked at him with a\nface which asked, “Do you not also feel the eternity of a true love?”\n\n“How sweet and wild are these serenades, Luis!” said Antonia. “I wonder\nwho wrote them?”\n\n“But, then, they were never written, my sister. Out of the hearts of\nlonely shepherds they came; or of women spinning in their quiet houses;\nyes, even of soldiers in the strong places keeping their watch.”\n\n“That is the truth, Luis,” answered Isabel. “And every Christmas, when\nI was in the convent the Sisters made a serenade to the Virgin, or a\nseguidilla to our blessed Lord. Very still are the Sisters, but when it\ncomes to singing, I can assure you the angels might listen!”\n\n“There is a seguidilla I hear everywhere,” said the doctor; “and I never\nhear it without feeling the better for listening. It begins--‘So noble a\nLord.’”\n\n“That, indeed!” cried Luis. “Who knows it not? It is the seguidilla\nto our blessed Lord, written by the daughter of Lope de Vega--the holy\nMarcela Carpio. You know it, Senora?”\n\n“As I know my Credo, Luis.”\n\n“And you, Isabel?”\n\n“Since I was a little one, as high as my father’s knee. Rachela taught\nit to me.”\n\n“And you, Lopez.”\n\n“That is sure, Luis.”\n\n“And I, too!” said Antonia, smiling. “Here is your mandolin. Strike the\nchords, and we will all sing with you. My father will remember also.”\n And the doctor smiled an assent, as the young man resigned Isabel’s hand\nwith a kiss, and swept the strings in that sweetness and power which\nflows invisibly, but none the less surely, from the heart to the\ninstrument.\n\n“It is to my blessed Lord and Redeemer, I sing,” he said, bowing his\nhead. Then he stood up and looked at his companions, and struck the\nkey-note, when every one joined their voices with his in the wonderful\nlittle hymn:\n\n        So noble a Lord\n          None serves in vain;\n        For the pay of my love\n          Is my love’s sweet pain.\n\n        In the place of caresses\n          Thou givest me woes;\n        I kiss Thy hands,\n          When I feel their blows.\n\n        For in Thy chastening,\n          Is joy and peace;\n        O Master and Lord!\n          Let thy blows not cease.\n\n        I die with longing\n          Thy face to see\n        And sweet is the anguish\n          Of death to me.\n\n        For, because Thou lovest me,\n          Lover of mine!\n        Death can but make me\n          Utterly Thine!\n\n\nThe doctor was the first to speak after the sweet triumph of the notes\nhad died away. “Many a soul I have seen pass whispering those verses,”\n he said; “men and women, and little children.”\n\n“The good Marcela in heaven has that for her joy,” answered Luis.\n\nLopez rose while the holy influence still lingered. He kissed the hands\nof every one, and held the doctor’s in his own until they reached the\nthreshold. A more than usual farewell took place there, though there\nwere only a few whispered words.\n\n“Farewell, Lopez! I can trust you?”\n\n“Unto death.”\n\n“If we never meet again?”\n\n“Still it will be FAREWELL. Thou art in God’s care.”\n\nVery slowly the doctor sauntered back to the parlor, like a man who has\na heavy duty to, do and hardly knows how to begin it. “But I will tell\nMaria first,” he whispered; and then he opened the door, and saw the\nSenora bidding her children good-night.\n\n“What a happy time we have had!” she was saying. “I shall never forget\nit. Indeed, my dears, you see how satisfactory it is to be religious.\nWhen we talk of the saints and angels, they come round us to listen to\nwhat we say; accordingly, we are full of peace and pleasure. I know that\nbecause I heard Fray--I heard a very good man say so.”\n\nShe smiled happily at her husband, as she took his arm, and twice, as\nthey went slowly upstairs together, she lifted her face for his kiss.\nHer gentleness and affection made it hard for him to speak; but there\nwere words to be said that could be no longer delayed; and when he had\nclosed the room door, he took her hands in his, and looked into her face\nwith eyes that told her all.\n\n“You are going away, Roberto,” she whispered.\n\n“My love! Yes! To-night--this very hour I must go! Luis and Dare also.\nDo not weep. I entreat you! My heart is heavy, and your tears I cannot\nbear.”\n\nThen she answered, with a noble Composure: “I will give you smiles and\nkisses. My good Roberto, so true and kind! I will try to be worthy of\nyou. Nay, but you must not weep--Roberto!”\n\nIt was true. Quite unconsciously the troubled husband and father was\nweeping. “I fear to leave you, dear Maria. All is so uncertain. I can\nonly ask you two favors; if you will grant them, you will do all that\ncan be done to send me away with hope. Will you promise me to have\nnothing to do whatever with Fray Ignatius; and to resist every attempt\nhe may make to induce you to go into a religious house of any kind?”\n\n“I promise you, Roberto. By my mother’s cross, I promise you!”\n\n“Again, dear Maria, if you should be in any danger, promise me that you\nwill do as Antonia and Lopez Navarro think it wisest and best.”\n\n“Go with God, my, husband. Go with God, in a good hour. All you wish, I\nwill do.”\n\nHe held her to his heart and kissed her, and she whispered amid her\ntender farewells to himself, messages to her soils--but especially to\nJuan. “Will you see Juan? If you do, tell him I repent. I send him a\nthousand blessings! Ah, the dear one! Kiss him for me, Roberto! Tell him\nhow much I love him, Roberto! How I sorrow because I was cross to him!\nMy precious one! My good son, who always loved me so dearly!”\n\nAt length Isabel came in to weep in her mother’s arms. “Luis is going\naway,” she cried. The father felt a momentary keen pang of jealousy. “I\nam going also, queridita,” he said mournfully. Then she threw her arms\naround his neck and bewailed her bad fortune. “If I were the Almighty\nGod, I would not give love and then take it away,” she murmured. “I\nwould give orders that the good people should always be happy. I would\nnot let men like Santa Anna live. He is a measureless monster, and ought\nto go to the d--to purgatory, at the very least.”\n\nWhile the Senora soothed her complaining, the doctor left. One troubled\nglance of a great love he cast backward from the door ere he closed it\nbehind him; and then his countenance suddenly changed. Stern and strong\nit grew, with a glow of anger in the steel-blue eyes that gave an\nentirely new character to it.\n\nHe called Antonia into his study, and talked with her of the crisis\nwhich was approaching, and of the conduct of their affairs in it. He\nshowed her the places in which his gold coin was hidden. He told her on\nwhom to rely in any emergency.\n\n“We have sure information that General Urrea, with the vanguard of a\nlarge Mexican army, will be here next month. Santa Anna will follow him\nquickly. You see that the city must either be defended or our men must\nretreat. I am going to Houston with this dilemma. Luis and Dare will\njoin Fannin at Goliad. Now, my dear child, you have my place to fill. If\nSanta Anna takes possession of San Antonio, what will you do?”\n\n“If we are not disturbed in any way, I will keep very quiet within my\nown home.”\n\n“If Fray Ignatius attempts to interfere with you--what then?”\n\n“I will fly from him, and take Isabel and mi madre with me.”\n\n“That is your only safety. I shall hear if the Americans desert the\ncity; then I will send your brother Thomas, if by any possibility it can\nbe done, to guard you to the eastern settlements. But I may not be able\nto do this--there may be no time--it cannot be depended upon--Lopez\nNavarro will help you all he can, and Ortiz. You may always rely on\nOrtiz.”\n\n“My father, I cannot trust Ortiz. Every man is a master to a peon. He\nwould mean to do kindly, but his cowardice might make him false.”\n\n“Ortiz is no peon. He is a Mexican officer of high rank, whom Santa\nAnna ordered to be shot. I saved his life. He wears the clothes of\na peon--that is necessary; but he has the honor and gratitude of a\ngentleman beneath them. If necessary, trust Ortiz fully. One thing above\nall others remember--FLIGHT before a convent.”\n\n“Flight! Yes, death before it! I promise you, father. When we meet\nagain, you shall say, well done, Antonia.”\n\nIt was now about midnight. They went back to the parlor. Luis and Dare\nsat by the dying fire. They were bent forward, close together over it,\ntalking in a low voice. They rose when the doctor spoke, and silently\nkissed Antonia.\n\n“It will be a hard ride, now,” said the doctor, and Dare answered,\nmechanically, “but we shall manage it.” He held Antonia’s hand, and\nshe went with them to the rear of the house. Their horses were standing\nready saddled. Silently the men mounted. In a moment they had passed the\ngate, and the beat of their horses’ hoofs gradually died away.\n\nBut all through the clear spaces of the sky the Christmas bells were\nringing, and the serenaders were musically telling each other,\n\n        “At twelve will the Child be born!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. DANGER AND HELP.\n\n        “A curious creed they weave,\n           And, for the Church commands it,\n         All men must needs believe,\n           Though no man understands it.\n         God loves his few pet lambs,\n           And saves his one pet nation;\n         The rest he largely damns,\n           With swinging reprobation.”\n\n        “The Church may loose and bind;\n         But Mind, immortal Mind,\n         As free as wave or wind,\n           Came forth, O God, from Thee.”\n                                 --BLACKIE.\n\nDr. Worth had set his daughter a task of no light magnitude. It was\ntrue, that Rachela and Fray Ignatius could no longer disturb the\nhousehold by their actual presence, but their power to cause unhappiness\nwas not destroyed. Among the Mexican families loyal to Santa Anna\nthe dismission of the priest and the duenna had been a source of much\nindignant gossip; for Rachela was one of those women who cry out when\nthey are hurt, and compel others to share their trouble. The priest had\nnot therefore found it necessary to explain WHY the Senora had called\nupon a new confessor. He could be silent, and possess his dignity in\nuncomplaining patience, for Rachela paraded his wrongs as a kind of\nset-off to her own.\n\nSuch piety! Such virtues! And the outrageous conduct of the Senor\nDoctor! To be sure there was cause for anger at the Senorita Antonia.\nOh, yes! She could crow her mind abroad! There were books--Oh, infamous\nbooks! Books not proper to be read, and the Senorita had them! Well\nthen, if the father burned them, that was a good deed done. And he had\nalmost been reviled for it--sent out of the house--yes, it was quite\npossible that he had been struck! Anything was possible from those\nAmerican heretics. As for her own treatment, after twenty years service,\nit had been cruel, abominable, more than that--iniquitous; but about\nthese things she had spoken, and the day of atonement would come.\nJustice was informing itself on the whole matter.\n\nSuch conversations continually diversified, extended, repeated on all\nhands, quickly aroused a prejudice against the doctor’s family. Besides\nwhich, the Senora Alveda resented bitterly the visits of her son Luis to\nIsabel. None of the customs of a Mexican betrothal had taken place,\nand Rachela did not spare her imagination in describing the scandalous\nAmerican familiarity that had been permitted. That, this familiarity had\ntaken place under the eyes of the doctor and the Senora only intensified\nthe insult. She might have forgiven clandestine meetings; but that the\nformalities due to the Church and herself should have been neglected was\nindeed unpardonable.\n\nIt soon became evident to the Senora that she had lost the good-will\nof her old friends, and the respect that had always been given to her\nsocial position. It was difficult for her to believe this, and she only\naccepted the humiliating fact after a variety of those small insults\nwhich women reserve for their own sex.\n\nShe was fond of visiting; she valued the good opinion of her caste, and\nin the very chill of the gravest calamities she worried her strength\naway over little grievances lying outside the walls of her home and the\nreal affections of her life. And perhaps with perfect truth she asserted\nthat SHE had done nothing to deserve this social ostracism. Others had\nmade her miserable, but she could thank the saints none could make her\nguilty.\n\nThe defeat of Cos had been taken by the loyal inhabitants as a mere\npreliminary to the real fight. They were very little disturbed by it.\nIt was the overt act which was necessary to convince Mexico that her\nclemency to Americans was a mistake, and that the ungrateful and impious\nrace must be wiped out of existence. The newspapers not only reiterated\nthis necessity, but proclaimed its certainty. They heralded the coming\nof Santa Anna, the victorious avenger, with passionate gasconading.\nIt was a mere question of a few days or weeks, and in the meantime\nthe people of San Antonio were “making a little profit and pleasure to\nthemselves out of the extravagant reprobates.” There was not a day in\nwhich they did not anticipate their revenge in local military displays,\nin dances and illuminations, in bull-fights, and in splendid religious\nprocessions.\n\nAnd Antonia found it impossible to combat this influence. It was in the\nhouse as certain flavors were in certain foods, or as heat was in\nfire. She saw it in the faces of her servants, and felt it in their\nindifference to their duty. Every hour she watched more anxiously\nfor some messenger from her father. And as day after day went by in a\nhopeless sameness of grief, she grew more restless under the continual\nsmall trials that encompassed her.\n\nTowards the end of January, General Urrea, at the head of the vanguard\nof the Mexican army, entered Texas. His destination was La Bahia or\nGoliad, a strong fortress garrisoned by Americans under Colonel Fanning.\nSanta Anna was to leave in eight days after him. With an army of twenty\nthousand men he was coming to the relief of San Antonio.\n\nThe news filled the city with the wildest rejoicing. The little bells\nof the processions, the big bells of the churches, the firing of cannon,\nthe hurrahs of the tumultuous people, made an uproar which reached the\nthree lonely women through the closed windows of their rooms.\n\n“If only Lopez Navarro would come! If he would send us some little\nmessage! Holy Mary, even he has forgotten us!” cried the Senora in a\nparoxysm of upbraiding sorrow.\n\nAt that moment the door opened, and Fray Ignatius passed the threshold\nwith lifted hands and a muttered blessing. He approached the Senora, and\nshe fell on her knees and kissed the hand with which he crossed her.\n\n“Holy father!” she cried, “the angels sent you to a despairing woman.”\n\n“My daughter, I have guided you since your first communion; how then\ncould I forget you? Your husband has deserted you--you, the helpless,\ntender lamb, whom he swore to cherish; but the blessed fold of your\nchurch stands open. Come, poor weary one, to its shelter.”\n\n“My father--”\n\n“Listen to me! The Mexican troops are soon to arrive. Vengeance without\nmercy is to be dealt out. You are the wife of an American rebel; I\ncannot promise you your life, or your honor, if you remain here. When\nsoldiers are drunk with blood, and women fall in their way, God have\nmercy upon them! I would shield even your rebellious daughter Antonia\nfrom such a fate. I open the doors of the convent to you all. There you\nwill find safety and peace.”\n\nIsabel sat with white, parted lips and clasped hands, listening. Antonia\nhad not moved or spoken. But with the last words the priest half-turned\nto her, and she came swiftly to her mother’s side, and kissing her,\nwhispered:\n\n“Remember your promise to my father! Oh, mi madre, do not leave Isabel\nand me alone!”\n\n“You, too, dear ones! We will all go together, till these dreadful days\nare past.”\n\n“No, no, no! Isabel and I will not go. We will die rather.”\n\n“The Senorita talks like a foolish one. Listen again! When Santa Anna\ncomes for judgment, it will be swift and terrible. This house and estate\nwill be forfeited. The faithful Church may hope righteously to obtain\nit. The sisters have long needed a good home. The convent will then come\nto you. You will have no shelter but the Church. Come to her arms ere\nher entreaties are turned to commands.”\n\n“My husband told me--”\n\n“Saints of God! you have no husband. He has forfeited every right to\nadvise you. Consider that, daughter; and if you trust not my advice,\nthere is yet living your honorable uncle, the Marquis de Gonzaga.”\n\nAntonia caught eagerly at this suggestion. It at least offered some\ndelay, in which the Senora might be strengthened to resist the coercion\nof Fray Ignatius.\n\n“Mother, it is a good thought. My great-uncle will tell you what to do;\nand my father will not blame you for following his advice. Perhaps even\nhe may offer his home. You are the child of his sister.”\n\nFray Ignatius walked towards the fire-place and stood rubbing slowly his\nlong, thin hands before the blaze, while the Senora and her daughters\ndiscussed this proposal. The half-frantic mother was little inclined\nto make any further effort to resist the determined will of her old\nconfessor; but the tears of Isabel won from her a promise to see her\nuncle.\n\n“Then, my daughter, lose no time. I cannot promise you many days in\nwhich choice will be left you. Go this afternoon, and to-morrow I will\ncall for your decision.”\n\nIt was not a visit that the Senora liked to make. She had deeply\noffended her uncle by her marriage, and their intercourse had since been\nof the most ceremonious and infrequent kind. But surely, at this hour,\nwhen she was left without any one to advise her steps, he would remember\nthe tie of blood between them.\n\nHe received her with more kindness than she had anticipated. His eyes\nglittered in their deep sockets when she related her extremity and the\npriest’s proposal, and his small shrunken body quivered with excitement\nas he answered:\n\n“Saints and angels! Fray Ignatius is right about Santa Anna. We shall\nsee that he will make caps for his soldiers out of the skins of these\ninfidel ingrates. But as for going into the convent, I know not. A\nmiserable marriage you made for yourself, Maria. Pardon, if I say so\nmuch! I let the word slip always. I was never one to bite my tongue. I\nam all old man--very well, come here, you and your daughters, till the\ndays of blood are over. There is room in the house, and a few comforts\nin it also. I have some power with Santa Anna. He is a great man--a\ngreat man! In all his wars, good fortune flies before him.”\n\nHe kissed her hands as he opened the door, and then went back to the\nfire, and bent, muttering, over it: “Giver of good! a true Yturbide; a\ngentle woman; she is like my sister Mercedes--very like her. These poor\nwomen who trust me, as I am a sinner before God, I am unhappy to deceive\nthem.”\n\nFray Ignatius might have divined his thoughts, for he entered at the\nmoment, and said as he approached him:\n\n“You have done right. The soul must be saved, if all is lost. This is\nnot a time for the friends of the Church and of Mexico to waver. The\nChurch is insulted every day by these foreign heretics--”\n\n“But you are mistaken, father; the Church holds up her head, whatever\nhappens. Even the vice-regal crown is not lost--the Church has cleft it\ninto mitres.”\n\nFray Ignatius smiled, but there was a curious and crafty look of inquiry\non his face. “The city is turbulent, Marquis, and there is undoubtedly a\ngreat number of Mexicans opposed to Santa Anna.”\n\n“Do you not know Mexicans yet? They would be opposed to God Almighty,\nrather than confess they were well governed. Bah! the genius of Mexico\nis mutiny. They scarcely want a leader to move their madness. They rebel\non any weak pretence. They bluster when they are courted; they crouch\nwhen they are oppressed. They are fools to all the world but themselves.\nI beg the Almighty to consider in my favor, that some over-hasty angel\nmisplaced my lot. I should have been born in--New York.”\n\nThe priest knew that he was talking for irritation, but he was too\npolitic to favor the mood. He stood on the hearth with his hands folded\nbehind him, and with a delightful suavity turned the conversation upon\nthe country rather than the people. It was a glorious day in the dawn\nof spring. The tenderest greens, the softest blues, the freshest scents,\nthe clearest air, the most delightful sunshine were everywhere. The\nwhite old town, with its picturesque crowds, its murmur of voices and\nlaughter, its echoes of fife and drum, its loves and its hatreds, was at\nhis feet; and, far off, the hazy glory of the mountains, the greenness\nand freshness of Paradise, the peace and freedom of the vast, unplanted\nplaces. The old marquis was insensibly led to contemplate the whole;\nand, in so doing, to put uppermost that pride of country which was the\nbase of every feeling susceptible to the priest’s influence.\n\n“Such a pleasant city, Marquis! Spanish monks founded it. Spanish\nand Mexican soldiers have defended it. Look at its fine churches and\nmissions; its lovely homes, and blooming gardens.”\n\n“It is also all our own, father. It was but yesterday I said to one of\nthose insolent Americans who was condescending to admire it: ‘Very good,\nSenor; and, if you deign to believe me, it was not brought from New\nYork. Such as you see it, it was made by ourselves here at San Antonio.’\nSaints in heaven! the fellow laughed in my face. We were mutually\nconvinced of each other’s stupidity.”\n\n“Ah, how they envy us the country! And you, Marquis, who have traveled\nover the world, you can imagine the reason?”\n\n“Father, I will tell you the reason; it is the craving in the heart to\nfind again the lost Eden. The Almighty made Texas with full hands. When\nHe sets his heart on a man, he is permitted to live there.”\n\n“Grace of God! You speak the truth. Shall we then give up the gift of\nHis hand to heretics and infidels?”\n\n“I cannot imagine it.”\n\n“Then every one must do the work he can do. Some are to slay the\nunbelievers; others; are to preserve the children of the Church. Your\nniece and her two daughters will be lost to the faith, unless you\ninterfere for their salvation. Of you will their souls be required.”\n\n“By Saint Joseph, it is a duty not in agreement with my desire! I, who\nhave carefully abstained from the charge of a wife and daughters of my\nown.”\n\n“It is but for a day or two, Marquis, until the matter is arranged. The\nconvent is the best of all refuges for women so desolate.”\n\nThe marquis did not answer. He lifted a book and began to read; and Fray\nIgnatius watched him furtively.\n\nIn the mean time the Senora had reached her home. She was pleased with\nthe result of her visit. A little kindness easily imposed upon this\nchildlike woman, and she trusted in any one who was pleasant to her.\n\n“You may believe me, Antonia,” she said; “my uncle was in a temper most\nunusual. He kissed my hands. He offered me his protection. That is a\ngreat thing, I assure you. And your father cannot object to our removal\nthere.”\n\nAntonia knew not what answer to make. Her heart misgave her. Why\nhad Fray Ignatius made the proposal? She was sure it was part of an\narrangement, and not a spontaneous suggestion of the moment. And she was\nequally sure that any preconcerted plan, having Fray Ignatius for its\nauthor, must be inimical to them.\n\nHer mother’s entry had not awakened Isabel, who lay asleep upon a sofa.\nThe Senora was a little nettled at the circumstance. “She is a very\nchild! A visit of such importance! And she is off to the land of\ndreams while I am fatiguing myself! I wish indeed that she had more\nconsideration!” Then Antonia brought her chocolate, and, as she drank\nit and smoked her cigarito, she chatted in an almost eager way about the\npersons she had seen.\n\n“Going towards the Plaza, I met judge Valdez. I stopped the carriage,\nand sent my affections to the Senora. Would you believe it? He answered\nme as if his mouth were full of snow. His disagreeable behavior was\nexactly copied by the Senora Silvestre and her daughter Esperanza. Dona\nJulia and Pilar de Calval did not even perceive me. Santa Maria! there\nare none so blind as those who won’t see! Oh, indeed! I found the\njourney like the way of salvation--full of humiliations. I would have\nstopped at the store of the Jew Lavenburg, and ordered many things, but\nhe turned in when he saw me coming. Once, indeed, he would have put his\nhat on the pavement for me to tread upon. But he has heard that your\nfather has made a rebel of himself, and what can be expected? He knows\nwhen Santa Anna has done with the rebels not one of them will have\nanything left for God to rain upon. And there was a great crowd and a\ngreat tumult. I think the whole city had a brain fever.”\n\nAt this moment Isabel began to moan in her sleep as if her soul was in\nsome intolerable terror or grief; and ere Antonia could reach her she\nsprang into the middle of the room with a shriek that rang through the\nhouse.\n\nIt was some minutes before the child could be soothed. She lay in her\nmother’s arms, sobbing in speechless distress; but at length she was\nable to articulate her fright:\n\n“Listen, mi madre, and may the Holy Lady make you believe me! I have had\na dream. God be blessed that it is not yet true! I will tell you. It was\nabout Fray Ignatius and our uncle the Marquis de Gonzaga. My good angel\ngave it to me; for myself and you all she gave it; and, as my blessed\nLord lives! I will not go to them! SI! I will cut my white throat\nfirst!” and she drew her small hand with a passionate gesture across\nit. She had stood up as she began to speak, and the action, added to\nher unmistakable terror, her stricken face and air of determination, was\nvery impressive.\n\n“You have had a dream, my darling?”\n\n“Yes, an awful dream, Antonia! Mary! Mary! Tender Mary, pity us!”\n\n“And you think we should not go to the house of the marquis?”\n\n“Oh, Antonia! I have seen the way. It is black and cold, and full of\nfear and pain. No one shall make me take it. I have the stiletto of my\ngrandmother Flores. I will ask Holy Mary to pardon me, and then--in a\nmoment--I would be among the people of the other world. That would be\nfar better than Fray Ignatius and the house of Gonzaga.”\n\nThe Senora was quite angry at this fresh complication. It was really\nincredible what she had to endure. And would Antonia please to tell\nher where else they were to go? They had not a friend left in San\nAntonio--they did not deserve to have one--and was it to be supposed\nthat a lady, born noble, could follow the Americans in an ox-wagon?\nAntonia might think it preferable to the comfortable house of her\nrelation; but blessed be the hand of God, which had opened the door of a\nrespectable shelter to her.\n\n“I will go in the ox-wagon,” said Isabel, with a sullen determination;\n“but I will not go into my uncle’s house. By the saint of my birth I\nswear it.”\n\n“Mother, listen to Antonia. When one door shuts, God opens another door.\nOur own home is yet undisturbed. Do you believe what Fray Ignatius says\nof the coming of Santa Anna? I do not. Until he arrives we are safe in\nour own home; and when the hour for going away comes, even a little bird\ncan show us the way to take. And I am certain that my father is planning\nfor our safety. If Santa Anna was in this city, and behaving with the\nbrutality which is natural to him, I would not go away until my father\nsent the order. Do you think he forgets us? Be not afraid of such a\nthing. It cannot take place.”\n\nTowards dusk Senor Navarro called, and the Senora brought him into her\nprivate parlor and confided to him the strait they were in. He looked\nwith sympathy into the troubled, tear-stained faces of these three\nhelpless women, and listened with many expressive gestures to the\nproposal of the priest and the offer of the old marquis.\n\n“Most excellent ladies,” he answered; “it is a plot. I assure you that\nit is a plot. Certainly it was not without reason I was so unhappy about\nyou this afternoon. Even while I was at the bull-fight, I think our\nangels were in a consultation about your affairs. Your name was in my\nears above all other sounds.”\n\n“You say it is a plot, Senor. Explain to us what you mean?”\n\n“Yes, I will tell you. Do you know that Fray Ignatius is the confessor\nof the marquis?”\n\n“We had not thought of such a thing.”\n\n“It is the truth. For many years they have been close as the skin and\nthe flesh. Without Fray Ignatius the marquis says neither yes or no.\nAlso the will of the marquis has been lately made. I have seen a copy of\nit. Everything he has is left to the brotherhoods of the Church. Without\ndoubt, Fray Ignatius was the, lawyer who wrote it.”\n\n“Senor, I always believed that would happen. At my marriage my uncle\nmade the determination. Indeed, we have never expected a piastre--no,\nnot even a tlaco. And to-day he was kind to me, and offered me his home.\nOh, Holy Mother, how wretched I am! Can I not trust in the good words of\nthose who are of my own family?”\n\n“The tie of race will come before the tie of the family. The tie of\nreligion is strongest of all, Senora. Let me tell you what will take\nplace. When you and your children are in the house of the marquis,\nhe will go before the Alcalde. He will declare that you have gone\nvoluntarily to his care, and that he is your nearest and most natural\nguardian. Very well. But further, he will declare, on account of his\ngreat age, and the troubled state of the time, he is unable to protect\nyou, and ask for the authority to place you in the religious care of the\nholy sisterhood of Saint Maria. And he will obtain all he wants.”\n\n“But, simply, what is to be gained by such treachery? He said to-day\nthat I was like his sister Mercedes, and he spoke very gently to me.”\n\n“He would not think such a proceeding really unkind. He would assure\nhimself that it was good for your eternal salvation. As to the reason,\nthat is to be looked for in the purse, where all reasons come from. This\nhouse, which the good doctor built, is the best in the city. It has even\ntwo full stories. It is very suitable for a religious house. It is not\nfar from the Plaza, yet secluded in its beautiful garden. Fray Ignatius\nhas long desired it. When he has removed you, possession will be taken,\nand Santa Anna will confirm the possession.”\n\n“God succor our poor souls! What shall we do then, Senor? The Mexican\narmy has entered Texas, it will soon be here.”\n\n“Quien sabe? Between the Rio Grande and the San Antonio are many\ndifficulties. Urrea has five thousand men with him, horses and\nartillery. The horses must graze, the men must rest and eat. We shall\nhave heavy rains. I am sure that it will be twenty days ere he reaches\nthe settlements; and even then his destination is not San Antonio, it is\nGoliad. Santa Anna will be at least ten days after him. I suppose, then,\nthat for a whole month you are quite safe in your own home. That is what\nI believe now. If I saw a reason to believe what is different, I would\ninform you. The good doctor, to whom I owe my life many times, has my\npromise. Lopez Navarro never broke his word to any man. The infamy would\nbe a thing impossible, where the safety of three ladies is concerned.”\n\n“And in a month, mi madre, what great things may happen! Thirty days of\npossibilities! Come, now, let us be a little happy, and listen to what\nthe Senor has to tell us. I am sure this house has been as stupid as a\nconvent”; and Isabel lifted the cigarette case of the Senora, and with\nkisses persuaded her to accept its tranquilizing consolation.\n\nIt was an elegant little golden trifle studded with gems. Her husband\nhad given it to her on the anniversary of their twenty-fifth wedding\nday; and it recalled vividly to her the few sweet moments. She was\nswayed as easily as a child by the nearest or strongest influence, and,\nafter all, it did seem the best to take Isabel’s advice, and be a little\nhappy while she could.\n\nLopez was delighted to humor this mood. He told them all the news of\ntheir own social set; and in such vivid times something happened\nevery day. There had been betrothals and marriages, quarrels and\nentertainments; and Lopez, as a fashionable young man of wealth and\nnobility, had taken his share in what had transpired.\n\nAntonia felt unspeakably grateful to him. After the fretful terror\nand anxiety of the day--after the cruel visit of Fray Ignatius--it was\nindeed a comfort to hear the pleasant voice of Navarro in all kinds of\ncheerful modulations. By and by there was a slow rippling laugh from\nIsabel, and the Senora’s face lost its air of dismal distraction.\n\nAt length Navarro had brought his narrative of small events down to\nthe afternoon of that day. There had been a bull-fight, and Isabel was\nmaking him describe to her the chulos, in their pale satin breeches\nand silk waist-scarfs; the toreros in their scarlet mantles, and the\npicadores on their horses.\n\n“And I assure you,” he said, “the company of ladies was very great and\nsplendid. They were in full dress, and the golden-pinned mantillas and\nthe sea of waving fans were a sight indeed. Oh, the fans alone! So many\ncolors; great crescents, growing and waning with far more enchantments\nthan the moons. Their rustle and movement has a wonderful charm,\nSenorita Isabel; no one can imagine it.\n\n“Oh, I assure you, Senor, I can see and feel it. But to be there! That,\nindeed, would make me perfectly happy.”\n\n“Had you been there to-day you would have admired, above all things,\nthe feat of the matadore Jarocho. It was upon the great bull Sandoval--a\nvery monster, I assure you. He came bellowing at Jarocho, as if he meant\nhis instant death. His eyeballs were living fire; his nostrils steamed\nwith fury; well, then, at the precise moment, Jarocho put his slippered\nfeet between his horns, and vaulted, light as a bird flies, over his\nback. Then Sandoval turned to him again. Well, he calmly waited for his\napproach, and his long sword met him between the horns. As lightly as\na lady touches her cavalier, he seemed to touch Sandoval; but the brute\nfell like a stone at his feet. What a storm of vivas! What clapping of\nhands and shouts of ‘valiente!’ And the ladies flung their flowers, and\nthe men flung their hats into the arena, and Jarocho stepped proudly\nenough on them, I can tell you, though he was watching the door for the\nnext bull.”\n\n“Ah, Senor, why will men fight each other, when it is so much more grand\nand interesting to fight bulls?”\n\n“Senorita Isabel, if you could only convince them of that! But then, it\nis not always interesting to the matadore; for instance, it is only by\nthe mercy of God and the skill of an Americano that Jarocho is at this\nmoment out of purgatory.”\n\nThe Senora raised herself from among the satin pillows of her sofa,\nand asked, excitedly; “Was there then some accident, Senor? Is Jarocho\nwounded? Poor Jarocho!”\n\n“Not a hair of his head is hurt, Senora. I will tell you. Saint Jago,\nwho followed Sandoval, was a little devil. He was light and quick, and\nhad intelligence. You could see by the gleam in his eyes that he took in\nthe whole scene, and considered not only the people in the ring, but the\npeople in the amphitheatre also, to be his tormentors. Perhaps in that\nreflection he was not mistaken. He meant mischief from the beginning;\nand he pressed Jarocho so close that he leaped the barrier for safety.\nAs he leaped, Saint Jago leaped also. Imagine now the terror of the\nspectators! The screams! The rush! The lowered horns within an inch of\nJarocho, and Fray Joseph Maria running with the consecrated wafer to\nthe doomed man! At that precise moment there was a rifle-shot, and the\nbellowing brute rolled backward into the arena--dead.”\n\n“Oh, Maria Purissima! How grand! In such moments one really lives,\nSenor. And but for this absurd rebellion I and my daughters could have\nhad the emotion. It is indeed cruel.”\n\n“You said the shot was fired by an American?”\n\n“Senorita Antonia, it was, indeed. I saw him. He was in the last row.\nHe had stood up when Saint Jago came in, and he was watching the man and\nthe animal with his soul in his eyes. He had a face, fine and thin as\na woman’s--a very gentle face, also. But at one instant it became stern\nand fierce, the lips hard set, the eyes half shut, then the rifle at\nthe shoulder like a flash of light, and the bull was dead between the\nbeginning and the end of the leap! The sight was wonderful, and the\nladies turned to him with smiles and cries of thankfulness, and the\nbetter part of the men bowed to him; for the Mexican gentleman is always\njust to a great deed. But he went away as if he had done something that\ndispleased himself, and when I overtook him at the gates of the Alamo,\nhe did not look as if he wished to talk about it.\n\n“However, I could not refrain myself, and I said: ‘Permit me, Colonel\nCrockett, to honor you. The great feat of to-day’s fight was yours. San\nAntonio owes you for her favorite Jarocho.’”\n\n“‘I saved a life, young man,’ he answered and I took a life; and I’ll be\nblamed if I know whether I did right or wrong.’ ‘Jarocho would have been\nkilled but for your shot.’ ‘That’s so; and I killed the bull; but you\ncan take my hat if I don’t think I killed the tallest brute of the two.\nAdjourn the subject, sir’; and with that he walked off into the fort,\nand I did myself the pleasure of coming to see you, Senora.”\n\nHe rose and bowed to the ladies, and, as the Senora was making some\npolite answer, the door of the room opened quickly, and a man entered\nand advanced towards her. Every eye was turned on him, but ere a word\ncould be uttered he was kneeling at the Senora’s side, and had taken her\nface in his hands, and was kissing it. In the dim light she knew him at\nonce, and she cried out: “My Thomas! My Thomas! My dear son! For three\nyears I have not seen you.”\n\nHe brought into the room with him an atmosphere of comfort and strength.\nSuddenly all fear and anxiety was lifted, and in Antonia’s heart the\nreaction was so great that she sank into a chair and began to cry like a\nchild. Her brother held her in his arms and soothed her with the promise\nof his presence and help. Then he said, cheerfully:\n\n“Let me have some supper, Antonia. I am as hungry as a lobos wolf; and\nrun away, Isabel, and help your sister, for I declare to you girls I\nshall eat everything in the house.”\n\nThe homely duty was precisely what was needed to bring every one’s\nfeelings to their normal condition; and Thomas Worth sat chatting with\nhis mother and Lopez of his father, and Jack, and Dare, and Luis, and\nthe superficial events of the time, with that pleasant, matter-of-course\nmanner which is by far the most effectual soother of troubled and\nunusual conditions.\n\nIn less than half an hour Antonia called her brother, and he and Lopez\nentered the dining-room together. They came in as brothers might come,\nface answering face with sympathetic change and swiftness; but Antonia\ncould not but notice the difference in the two men. Lopez was dressed in\na suit of black velvet, trimmed with many small silver buttons. His sash\nwas of crimson silk. His linen was richly embroidered; and his wide hat\nwas almost covered with black velvet, and adorned with silver tags. It\nwas a dress that set off admirably his dark intelligent face.\n\nThomas Worth wore the usual frontier costume; a dark flannel shirt, a\nwide leather belt, buck-skin breeches, and leather boots covering his\nknees. He was very like his father in figure and face--darker, perhaps,\nand less handsome. But the gentleness and strength of his personal\nappearance attracted every one first, and invested all traits with their\nown distinctive charm.\n\nAnd, oh! What a change was there in the the{sic} Senora’s room. The\npoor lady cried a little for joy, and then went to sleep like a wearied\nchild. Isabel and Antonia were too happy to sleep. They sat half through\nthe night, talking softly of the danger they had been in. Now that\nThomas had come, they could say HAD. For he was a very Great-heart\nto them, and they could even contemplate the expected visit of\nFray Ignatius without fear; yes, indeed, with something very like\nsatisfaction.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. THE ARRIVAL OF SANTA ANNA.\n\n        “What thing thou doest, bravely do;\n            When Heaven’s clear call hath found thee,\n         Follow--with fervid wheels pursue,\n            Though thousands bray around thee.”\n\n        “Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed,\n         Which his aspiring rider seemed to know;\n         With slow but stately pace kept on his course;\n         You would have thought the very windows spoke,\n         So many greedy looks of young and old,\n         Through casements darted their desiring eyes\n         Upon his visage.”\n\nLeft to themselves, the two men threw off like a mask the aspect of\ncheerfulness they had worn in the presence of the Senora. Thomas Worth\nate heartily, for he had been without food since morning; but Navarro\ndid not attempt to join his meal. He sat patiently waiting his sombre\neyes fixed upon the mental visions which circled in the enchanted\nincense of his cigarette.\n\nPresently Thomas Worth turned toward the hearth, pushed the cedar logs\non it to a focus, and at their leaping blaze lighted the pipe which he\ntook from his pocket. “Lopez,” he said, “it strikes me that I am just\nin time to prevent some infamous plan of Fray Ignatius and my uncle\nGonzaga.”\n\n“I should not have lost sight of the Senora and your sisters. I have\nwatched them faithfully, though for many good reasons it has been best\nto appear indifferent. Will you now remain in San Antonio?”\n\n“I have come with orders to Travis to blow up the Alamo, and fall back\nupon Houston, who is at Gonzales. But I do not think the men will permit\nhim to do so.”\n\n“You have too many leaders. Also, they undervalue the Mexican soldiers.\nI assure you they do. They fought Spain for ten years; they do not want,\nthen, the persistence of true valor. The Americans may die in the Alamo,\nbut they cannot hold it against the thousands Santa Anna will bring with\nhim.”\n\n“They will die, then. They have no thought of retreat, nor of any deed\nthat argues fear. Every man relies on himself, as if in his hand the\nmoment of victory lay.”\n\n“Every man will perish.”\n\n“They will not perish in vain. Defeat is only a spur to the American\nsoldier. Every, one makes him a better fighter. If Santa Anna massacres\nthe men in the Alamo, he seals the freedom of Texas.”\n\n“Houston should have come himself.”\n\n“Houston is biding his time. He is doing at present the hardest duty\na great man can do: setting an example of obedience to a divided and\nincompetent government. Lopez, you said rightly that we had too many\nleaders. When those appointed for sacrifice have been offered up--when\nwe are in the extremity of danger and ruin, then Houston will hear the\nword he is waiting for.”\n\n“And he will lead you on to victory. Indeed, I know it. I have seen him.\nHe has the line--the fortunate line on the forehead. He is the loadstone\nin the breast of your cause; the magnet who can draw good fortune to it.\nIf fate be against you, he will force fate to change her mind. If fate\nweave you a common thread, he will change it into purple. Victory, which\nshe gives to others reluctantly, he will take like a master from her\nhand HOUSTON! What essence! What existence! What honor! What hope there\nis in those seven letters. Consider this: He will find a way or make a\nway for freedom.”\n\nSubsequent events proved the opinion of Thomas Worth correct with\nregard to the garrison in the Alamo. David Crockett! James Bowie! Barret\nTravis! The names were a host in themselves; one and all refused to\ncouple them with retreat.\n\n“Military defeats may be moral victories, young man,” said Crockett to\nThomas Worth; “and moral victories make national greatness. The\nRoman that filled the gulf with his own body--the men who died at\nThermopylae--they live to-day, and they have been talking with us.”\n\n“But if you join Houston you will save many lives.”\n\n“That isn’t always the point, sir. Jim Bowie was saying there was once a\nlover who used to swim two miles every night to see a young woman called\nHero. Now, he might have waited for a boat and gone dry-shod to his\nsweetheart; but if he had, who would have cared whether he lived or\ndied? The Alamo is our Hero. If we can’t keep her, we can die for her.”\n\nThe same spirit moved every soul at Goliad. Fanning was there with\nnearly nine hundred men, and he had named the place Fort Defiance, and\nasserted his determination to hold it. In the mean time, Houston was\nusing his great personal influence to collect troops, to make treaties\nwith the Indians, and to keep together some semblance of a provisional\ngovernment.\n\nBut it had become evident to all the leading spirits of the revolution\nthat no half-way measures would now do. They only produced half-way\nenthusiasm. For this end, Houston spoke out with his accustomed\nboldness:\n\n“Gentlemen, we must declare the independence of Texas, and like our\nfore-elders, sink or swim by that declaration. Nothing else, nothing\nless, can save us. The planters of Texas must feel that they are\nfighting for their own constitution, and not for Mexican promises made\nto them twelve years ago and never yet kept.”\n\nThe simple proposition roused a new enthusiasm; for while Urrea was\nhastening towards Goliad, and Santa Anna towards San Antonio, and\nFilisola to Washington, the divided people were becoming more and more\nembittered. The American soldiers, who had hitherto gone in and out\namong the citizens of San Antonio during the day, and only slept in the\nAlamo, were conscious of an ominous change in the temper of the city.\nThey gathered their recruits together and shut themselves in the\nfortress.\n\nAgain Thomas Worth urged them to fall back either upon the line of\nHouston at Gonzales, or Fanning at Goliad; but in the indecision and\nuncertainty of all official orders, Crockett thought it best to make the\nfirst stand at the Mexican city.\n\n“We can, at least,” he said, “keep Santa Anna busy long enough to give\nthe women and children of our own settlements time to escape, and the\nmen time to draw together with a certain purpose.”\n\n“The cry of Santa Anna has been like the cry of wolf! wolf!” said Bowie.\n“I hear that great numbers that were under arms have gone home to\nplant their corn and cotton. Do you want Santa Anna to murder them\npiecemeal--house by house, family by family? Great George! Which of us\nwould accommodate him with a prolonged pleasure like that? No! he shall\nhave a square fight for every life lie gets”; and the calm, gentlemanly\nBowie was suddenly transformed into a flashing, vehement, furious\navenger. He laid his knife and pistols on the table, his steel-blue eyes\nscintillated as if they were lightning; his handsome mouth, his long,\nwhite hands, his whole person radiated wrath and expressed the utmost\nlengths of invincible courage and insatiable hatred.\n\n“Gentlemen,” answered Travis, “I go with Crockett and Bowie. If we hold\nthe Alamo, it is a deed well done. If we fall with it, it is still\na deed well done. We shall have given to Houston and Fanning time to\ninterpose themselves between Santa Anna and the settlements.”\n\n“We have none of us lived very well,” said Bowie, “but we can die well.\nI say as an American, that Texas is ours by right of natural locality,\nand by right of treaty; and, as I live, I will do my best to make\nit American by right of conquest! Comrades, I do not want a prettier\nquarrel to die in”--and looking with a brave, unflinching gaze around\nthe grim fortress--“I do not want a better monument than the Alamo!”\n\nThe speech was not answered with any noisy hurrahing; but the men\naround the bare, long table clasped hands across it, and from that last\ninterview with the doomed men Thomas Worth came away with the knowledge\nthat he had seen the battle begun. He felt now that there was no time to\ndelay longer his plans for the safety of his mother and sisters. These\nwere, indeed, of the simplest and most uncertain character; for the\ncondition of the country and its few resources were such as to make\nflight the only way that promised safety. And yet flight was environed\nwith dangers of every kind--hunger, thirst, exhaustion, savage beasts,\nIndians, and the triple armies of Mexico.\n\nThe day after his arrival he had begun to prepare, as far as possible,\nfor this last emergency, but the Senora’s unconquerable aversion to\nleave her native city had constantly hampered him. Until Santa Anna\nreally appeared she would not believe in the necessity of such a\nmovement. The proposal of Fray Ignatius, even if it did end in a\nconvent, did not seem so terrible as to be a wanderer without a roof\nto cover her. She felt aggrieved and injured by Antonia’s and Isabel’s\npositive refusal to accept sanctuary from the priest, and with the\nunderhand cunning of a weak woman she had contrived to let Fray Ignatius\nknow that SHE was not to blame for the refusal.\n\nAll the same the priest hated her in conjunction with her children. On\nthe morning after her interview with her uncle, he went to receive her\nsubmission; for the marquis had informed him of all that had passed, and\nhe felt the three women and the valuable Worth property already under\nhis hard hand. He opened the gate with the air of a proprietor. He\nlooked down the lovely alleys of the garden, and up at the latticed\nstories of the handsome house, with that solid satisfaction which is the\nreward of what is acquired by personal effort or wisdom.\n\nWhen he entered the door and was confronted by Thomas Worth, he was\nfor the moment nonplussed. But he did not permit his confusion and\ndisappointment to appear. He had not seen Thomas for a long time. He\naddressed him with suavity and regrets, and yet, “was sure he would\nbe glad to hear that, in the present dangerous crisis, the Marquis de\nGonzaga had remembered the blood-tie and offered his protection to a\nfamily so desolate.”\n\nThomas Worth leaned upon the balusters, as if guarding the approach to\nthe Senora’s apartments. He answered: “The protection of the marquis\nis unnecessary. Three ladies are too great a charge for one so aged. We\nwill not impose it.” The face of the young man was calm and stern, but\nhe spoke without visible temper, until the priest prepared to pass him.\nThen he stretched out his arm as a barrier.\n\n“Fray Ignatius, you have already passed beyond the threshold; permit me\nto remind you of Dr. Worth’s words on that subject.”\n\n“I put my duty before any man’s words.”\n\n“Sir, for my mother’s sake, I would not be disrespectful; but I assure\nyou, also, that I will not permit any man, while I live, to disregard my\nfather’s orders regarding his own household.”\n\n“I must see the Senora.”\n\n“That, I reply, is impossible.”\n\n“Presume not--dare not to interfere with a priest in the duty of his\noffice. It is a mortal sin. The curse of the Church will rest upon you.\n\n“The curse of the Church will not trouble me. But to treat my father’s\nknown wishes with contempt--that is an act of dishonor and disobedience\nwhich I will not be guilty of.”\n\n“Santa Maria! Suffer not my spirit to be moved by this wicked one. Out\nof my path, Satanas!”\n\nThe last word was not one which Thomas Worth had expected. He flushed\ncrimson at its application, and with a few muttered sentences,\nintelligible only to the priest, he took him firmly by the shoulder, led\nhim outside the door, and closed and barred it.\n\nThe expulsion was not accomplished without noisy opposition on the part\nof Fray Ignatius, and it pained Thomas deeply to hear, in the midst of\nthe priest’s anathemas, the shrill cries of his mother’s distress and\ndisapproval.\n\nThe next domestic movement of Thomas Worth was to rid the house of Molly\nand Manuel, and the inferior servants. It was not as easy a task as may\nbe supposed. They had been ordered by Fray Ignatius to remain, and the\norder had not been countermanded. Even if the Senora and her daughters\nwere going east, and their services were not needed, they had no\nobjections to remain in the Worth house. They understood that the\nChurch would take possession, and the housekeeping of the Church was\nnotoriously easy and luxurious.\n\nHowever, after exorbitant compensation had been made, and Molly had\ngiven in return “a bit of her mind,” she left for the Irish colony of\nSan Patricio, and Manuel immediately sought his favorite monte table.\nWhen he had doubled his money, he intended to obey Molly’s emphatic\norders, and go and tell the priest all about it.\n\n“I would rather, face a battery of cannon than Fray Ignatius and the\nservants again, Antonia.” Antonia looked at her brother; he was worried\nand weary, and his first action, when he had finally cleared the house,\nwas to walk around it, and bolt every door and window. Antonia followed\nhim silently. She perceived that the crisis had come, and she was doing\nas good women in extremity do--trying to find in the darkness the hand\nalways stretched out to guide and strengthen. As yet she had not been\nable to grasp it. She followed her brother like one in a troubled dream,\nwhispering faintly, with white lips, “O God, where art Thou? Help and\npity us!”\n\nThomas led her finally to his father’s office. He went to a closet\nfilled with drugs, removed them, and then a certain pressure of his hand\ncaused the back of the closet to disappear in a groove, and a receptacle\nfull of coin and papers was disclosed.\n\n“We must take with us all the coin we can carry. What you are not likely\nto require, is to go to the men in the field. Then, hide in its place\nthe old silver, and the laces, and the jewels, which came with the\nFlores from Castile; and any other papers and valuables, which you\nreceived from our father. I think even Fray Ignatius will not discover\nthem here.”\n\n“Is there any special need to hurry to-day?\n\n“Santa Anna is within forty-eight hours of San Antonio. He may force a\nmarch, and be here earlier. Travis told me last night that their advance\nscouts had come in with this intelligence. To-day they will gather every\nman they can, and prepare to defend themselves in the Alamo. As soon as\nSanta Anna arrives, we are in danger. I must leave here to-night. I must\neither take you with me or remove you to a place of more safety.”\n\n“Let us go with you.”\n\n“If my mother is willing.”\n\n“If she is not, what then?”\n\n“Lopez has prepared for that emergency. He has an empty house three\nmiles west of San Antonio. He has had it completely victualled. I will\ntake you there after dark in the large green chariot. Ortiz will drive\nthe light Jersey wagon on the Gonzales road. When inquiry is made, the\nJersey wagon will have attracted the attention of every Mexican, and\nFray Ignatius will receive positive assurances that you were in it and\nare beyond his power. And certainly, without definite intelligence, he\nwould never suspect you of being anywhere on the highway to Mexico.”\n\n“Shall we be quite alone?”\n\n“For two or three days you will be quite alone. Ortiz will, however,\nreturn with the wagon by a circuitous route; for, sooner or later, you\nare sure to need it. Fear not to trust him. Only in one respect will you\nneed to supplement his advice by your own intelligence: he is so\neager to fight Santa Anna, he may persuade himself and you that it is\nnecessary to fly eastward when it is not. In all other points you may be\nguided by him, and his disguise as a peon is so perfect that it will be\neasy for him to gather in the pulquerias all the information requisite\nfor your direction. I have been out to the house, and I can assure you\nthat Lopez has considered everything for your comfort.”\n\n“However, I would rather go with you, Thomas.”\n\n“It must be as mother desires.”\n\nWhen the circumstances were explained to the Senora, she was at first\nvery determined to accept neither alternative. “She would remain where\nshe was. She was a Flores and a Gonzaga. Santa Anna knew better than\nto molest her. She would rather trust to him than to those dreadful\nAmericans.” Reminded of Fray Ignatius, she shed a few tears over\nthe poor padrecito, and assured her children they had made a mistake\nregarding him, which neither oil nor ointment, nor wit nor wisdom, could\nget over.\n\nIt was almost impossible to induce her to come to a decision of any\nkind; and only when she saw Antonia and Isabel were dressed for\na journey, and that Thomas had locked up all the rooms and was\nextinguishing the fires, could she bring herself to believe that the\ntrial so long anticipated had really come.\n\n“My dearest mother! My own life and the lives of many others may now\nhang upon a few moments. I can remain here no longer. Where shall I take\nyou to?”\n\n“I will not leave my home.”\n\n“Santa Anna is almost here. As soon as he arrives, Fray Ignatius\nand twelve of the Bernardine monks are coming here. I was told that\nyesterday.”\n\n“Then I will go to the convent. I and my daughters.”\n\n“No, mother; if you go to the convent, Antonia and Isabel must go with\nme.”\n\nShe prayed, and exclaimed, and appealed to saints and angels, and to the\nholy Virgin, until Isabel was hysterically weeping, Antonia at a mental\ntension almost unendurable, and Thomas on the verge of one of those\nterrifying passions that mark the extremity of habitually gentle,\npatient men.\n\n“My God, mother!” he exclaimed with a stamp of his spurred boot on the\nstone floor; “if you will go to the devil--to the priests, I mean--you\nmust go alone. Kiss your mother farewell, girls. I have not another\nmoment to wait.”\n\nThen, in a passion of angry sobs and reproaches, she decided to go with\nher daughters, and no saint ever suffered with a more firm conviction of\ntheir martyrdom to duty than did this poor foolish, affectionate slave\nto her emotions and her superstitions. But when Thomas had gone, and\nnothing was to be gained by a display of her sufferings, she permitted\nherself to be interested in their hiding-place, and after Antonia had\ngiven her a cup of chocolate, and Isabel had petted and soothed her, she\nbegan gradually to allow them to explain their situation, and even to\nfeel some interest in its discussion.\n\nThey sat in the charmful, dusky glimmer of starlight, for candles and\nfire were forbidden luxuries. Fortunately, the weather was warm and\nsunny, and for making chocolate and such simple cookery, Lopez had\nprovided a spirit lamp. The Senora was as pleased as a child with\nthis arrangement. She had never seen anything like it before. She even\nimagined the food cooked upon it had some rare and unusual flavor. She\nwas quite proud when she had learned its mysteries, and quite sure that\nchocolate she made upon it was chocolate of a most superior kind.\n\nThe house had been empty for two years, and the great point was to\npreserve its air of desolation. No outside arrangement was touched; the\ntorn remnants of some balcony hangings were left fluttering in the wind;\nthe closed windows and the closed doors, the absence of smoke from the\nchimneys and of lights from the windows, preserved the air of emptiness\nand loneliness that the passers-by had been accustomed to see. And,\nas it was on the highway into the city, there were great numbers\nof passers: mule-trains going to Mexico and Sonora; cavaliers and\npedestrians; splendidly-dressed nobles and officials, dusty peons\nbringing in wood; ranchmen, peddlers, and the whole long list of a great\ncity’s purveyors and servants.\n\nBut though some of the blinds were half-closed, much could be seen;\nand Isabel also often took cushions upon the flat roof, and lying down,\nwatched, from between the pilasters of the balustrade surrounding it,\nthe moving panorama.\n\nOn the morning of the third day of what the Senora, called their\nimprisonment, they went to the roof to sit in the clear sunshine and\nthe fresh wind. They were weary and depressed with the loneliness and\nuncertainty of their position, and were almost longing for something to\nhappen that would push forward the lagging wheels of destiny.\n\nA long fanfare of trumpets, a roll of drums, a stirring march of warlike\nmelody, startled them out of the lethargic tedium of exhausted hopes and\nfears. “It is Santa Anna!” said Antonia; and though they durst not stand\nup, they drew closer to the balustrade and watched for the approaching\narmy. Is there any woman who can resist that nameless emotion which both\nfires and rends the heart in the presence of great military movements?\nAntonia was still and speechless, and white as death. Isabel\nwatched with gleaming eyes and set lips. The Senora’s excitement was\nunmistakably that of exultant national pride.\n\nSanta Anna and his staff-officers were in front. They passed too rapidly\nfor individual notice, but it was a grand moving picture of handsome\nmen in scarlet and gold--of graceful mangas and waving plumes, and\nbright-colored velvet capes; of high-mettled horses, and richly-adorned\nMexican saddles, aqueras of black fur, and silver stirrups; of thousands\nof common soldiers, in a fine uniform of red and blue; with antique\nbrazen helmets gleaming in the sun, and long lances, adorned with\ntri-colored streamers. They went past like a vivid, wonderful\ndream--like the vision of an army of mediaeval knights.\n\nIn a few minutes the tumult of the advancing army was increased tenfold\nby the clamor of the city pouring out to meet it. The clashing bells\nfrom the steeples, the shouting of the populace, the blare of trumpets\nand roll of drums, the lines of churchmen and officials in their\ngrandest dresses, of citizens of every age,--the indescribable human\nmurmur--altogether it was a scene whose sensuous splendor obliterated\nfor a time the capacity of impressionable natures to judge rightly.\n\nBut Antonia saw beyond all this brave show the ridges of red war, and a\nnoble perversity of soul made her turn her senses inward. Then her eyes\ngrew dim, and her heart rose in pitying prayer for that small band of\nheroes standing together for life and liberty in the grim Alamo. No pomp\nof war was theirs. They were isolated from all their fellows. They were\nsurrounded by their enemies. No word of sympathy could reach them. Yet\nshe knew they would stand like lions at bay; that they would give life\nto its last drop for liberty; and rather than be less than freemen, they\nwould prefer not to be at all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. THE FALL OF THE ALAMO.\n\n        “The combat deepens.  On, ye brave!\n         Who rush to glory or the grave.”\n\n        “To all the sensual world proclaim:\n         One crowded hour of glorious life\n         Is worth an age without a name.”\n\n        “Gashed with honorable scars,\n             Low in Glory’s lap they lie;\n         Though they fell, they fell like stars,\n             Streaming splendor through the sky.”\n\nThe passing-by of Santa Anna and the Mexican army, though it had been\nhourly expected for nearly three days, was an event which threw the\nSenora and her daughters into various conditions of mental excitement.\nThey descended from the roof to the Senora’s room, where they could move\nabout and converse with more freedom. For the poor lady was quite\nunable to control her speech and actions, and was also much irritated by\nAntonia’s more composed manner. She thought it was want of sympathy.\n\n“How can you take things with such a blessed calmness,” she asked,\nangrily. “But it is the way of the Americans, no doubt, who must have\neverything for prudence. Sensible! Sensible! Sensible! that is the tune\nthey are forever playing, and you dance to it like a miracle.”\n\n“My dear mother, can we do any good by exclaiming and weeping?”\n\n“Holy Virgin! Perhaps not; but to have a little human nature is more\nagreeable to those who are yet on the earth side of purgatory.”\n\n“Mi madre,” said Isabel, “Antonia is our good angel. She thinks for us,\nand plans for us, and even now has everything ready for us to move at\na moment’s notice. Our good angels have to be sensible and prudent,\nmadre.”\n\n“To move at a moment’s notice! Virgin of Guadalupe! where shall we go\nto? Could my blessed father and mother see me in this prison, this very\nvault, I assure you they would be unhappy even among the angels.”\n\n“Mother, there are hundreds of women today in Texas who would think this\nhouse a palace of comfort and safety.”\n\n“Saints and angels! Is that my fault? Does it make my condition more\nendurable? Ah, my children, I have seen great armies come into San\nAntonio, and always before I have been able to make a little pleasure to\nmyself out of the event. For the Mexicans are not blood-thirsty,\nthough they are very warlike. When Bravo was here, what balls, what\nbull-fights, what visiting among the ladies! Indeed there was so much\nto tell, the tertulia was as necessary as the dinner. To be sure, the\nMexicans are not barbarians; they made a war that had some refinement.\nBut the Americans! They are savages. With them it is fight, fight,\nfight, and if we try to be agreeable, as we were to that outrageous Sam\nHouston, they say thank you, madam, and go on thinking their own cruel\nthoughts. I wonder the gentle God permits that such men live.”\n\n“Dear mother, refinement in war is not possible. Nothing can make it\notherwise than brutal and bloody.”\n\n“Antonia, allow that I, who am your mother, should know what I have\nsimply seen with my eyes. Salcedo, Bravo, Martinez, Urrea--are they not\ngreat soldiers? Very well, then, I say they brought some pleasure with\ntheir armies; and you will see that Santa Anna will do the same. If we\nwere only in our own home! It must have been the devil who made us leave\nit.”\n\n“How truly splendid the officers looked, mi madre. I dare say Senora\nValdez will entertain them.”\n\n“That is certain. And as for Dorette Valdez--the coquette--it will\ncertainly be a great happiness to her.”\n\nIsabel sighed, and the Senora felt a kind of satisfaction in the sigh.\nIt was unendurable to be alone in her regrets and her longings.\n\n“Yes,” she continued, “every night Senora Trespalacios will give a\ntertulia, and the officers will have military balls--the brave young\nmen; they will be so gay, so charming, so devoted, and in a few\nhours, perhaps, they will go into the other world by the road of the\nbattlefield. Ah, how pitiful! How interesting! Cannot you imagine it?”\n\nIsabel sighed again, but the sigh was for the gay, the charming Luis\nAlveda. And when she thought of him, she forgot in a moment to envy\nDorette Valdez, or the senoritas of the noble house of Trespalacios. And\nsome sudden, swift touch of sympathy, strong as it was occult, made\nthe Senora at the same moment remember her husband and her sons. A real\nsorrow and a real anxiety drove out all smaller annoyances. Then both\nher daughters wept together, until their community of grief had brought\nto each heart the solemn strength of a divine hope and reliance.\n\n“My children, I will go now and pray,” said the sorrowful wife\nand mother. “At the foot of the cross I will wait for the hour of\ndeliverance;” and casting herself on her knees, with her crucifix in\nher hand, she appeared in a moment to have forgotten everything but\nher anguish and her sins, and the Lamb of God upon whom, with childlike\nfaith, she was endeavoring to cast them. Her tears dropped upon\nthe ivory image of the Crucified, and sympathetic tears sprung into\nAntonia’s and Isabel’s eyes, as they listened to her imploration.\n\nThat night, when all was dark and still, Ortiz returned with the wagon.\nIn the morning Antonia went to speak to him. He looked worn-out and\nsorrowful, and she feared to ask him for news. “There is food in the\nhouse, and I have made you chocolate,” she said, as she pitifully\nscanned the man’s exhausted condition.\n\n“The Senorita is kind as the angels. I will eat and drink at her order.\nI am, indeed, faint and hungry.”\n\nShe brought him to the table, and when he refused to sit in her\npresence, she said frankly, “Captain Ortiz, you are our friend and not\nour servant. Rest and refresh yourself.”\n\nHe bent upon one knee and kissed the hand she offered, and without\nfurther remonstrance obeyed her desire. Isabel came in shortly, and with\nthe tact of true kindness she made no remark, but simply took the chair\nbeside Ortiz, and said, in her usual voice and manner: “Good morning,\nCaptain. We are glad to see you. Did you meet my brother Thomas again?”\n\n“Senorita, God be with you! I have not seen him. I was at Goliad.”\n\n“Then you would see our brother Juan?”\n\n“Si. The Senor Juan is in good health and great happiness. He sent by my\nwilling hands a letter.”\n\n“Perhaps also you saw his friend, Senor Grant?”\n\n“From him, also, I received a letter. Into your gracious care, Senorita,\nI deliver them.”\n\n“I thank you for your kindness, Captain. Tell us now of the fortress.\nAre the troops in good spirits?”\n\n“Allow me to fear that they are in too good assurance of success.\nThe most of the men are very young. They have not yet met our Lady of\nSorrows. They have promised to themselves the independence of Texas.\nThey will also conquer Mexico. There are kingdoms in the moon for them.\nI envy such exaltations--and regret them. GRACE OF GOD, Senorita!\nMy heart ached to see the crowds of bright young faces. With a\nNapoleon--with a Washington to lead them--they would do miracles.”\n\n“What say you to Houston?”\n\n“I know him not. At Goliad they are all Houstons. They believe each man\nin himself. On the contrary, I wish that each man looked to the same\nleader.”\n\n“Do you know that Santa Anna is in San Antonio?”\n\n“I felt it, though I had no certain news. I came far around, and hid\nmyself from all passers-by, for the sake of the wagon and the horses.\nI have the happiness to say they are safe. The wagon is within the\nenclosure, the horses are on the prairie. They have been well trained,\nand will come to my call. As for me, I will now go into the city, for\nthere will be much to see and to hear that may be important to us.\nSenoritas, for all your desires, I am at your service.”\n\nWhen Ortiz was gone, Isabel had a little fret of disappointment. Luis\nmight have found some messenger to bring her a word of his love and\nlife. What was love worth that did not annihilate impossibilities!\nHowever, it consoled her a little to carry Jack’s letter to his mother.\nThe Senora had taken her morning chocolate and fallen asleep. When\nIsabel awakened her, she opened her eyes with a sigh, and a look of\nhopeless misery. These pallid depressions attacked her most cruelly in\nthe morning, when the room, shabby and unfamiliar, gave both her memory,\nand anticipation a shock.\n\nBut the sight of the letter flushed her face with expectation. She took\nit with smiles. She covered it with kisses. When she opened it, a curl\nfrom Jack’s head fell on to her lap. She pressed it to her heart, and\nthen rose and laid it at the feet of her Madonna. “She must share my\njoy,” she said with a pathetic childishness; “she will understand it.”\n Then, with her arm around Isabel, and the girl’s head on his shoulder,\nthey read together Jack’s loving words:\n\n“Mi madre, mi madre, you have Juan’s heart in your heart. Believe me,\nthat in all this trouble I sorrow only for you. When victory is won I\nshall fly to you. Other young men have other loves; I have only you,\nsweet mother. There is always the cry in my heart for the kiss I missed\nwhen I left you. If I could hold your hand to-night, if I could hear\nyour voice, if I could lay my head on your breast, I would say that the\nHoly One had given me the best blessings He had in heaven. Send to me a\nletter, madre--a letter full of love and kisses. Forgive Juan! Think of\nthis only: HE IS MY BOY! If I live, it is for you, who are the loveliest\nand dearest of mothers. If I die, I shall die with your name on my lips.\nI embrace you with my soul. I kiss your hands, and remember how often\nthey have clasped mine. I kiss your eyes, your cheeks, your dear lips.\nMi madre, remember me! In your prayers, remember Juan!”\n\nWith what tears and sobs was this loving letter read by all the women;\nand the Senora finally laid it where she had laid the precious curl that\nhad come with it. She wanted “the Woman blessed among women” to share\nthe mother joy and the mother anguish in her heart. Besides, she was a\nlittle nervous about Jack’s memento of himself. Her superstitious lore\ntaught her that severed hair is a token of severed love. She wished he\nhad not sent it, and yet she could not bear to have it out of her sight.\n\n“Gracias a Dios!” she kept ejaculating. “I have one child that loves me,\nand me only. I shall forgive Juan everything. I shall not forgive Thomas\nmany things. But Juan! oh! it is impossible not to love him entirely.\nThere is no one like him in the world. If the good God will only give\nhim back to me, I will say a prayer of thanks every day of my life long.\nOh, Juan! Juan! my boy! my dear one!”\n\nThus she talked to herself and her daughters continually. She wrote a\nletter full of motherly affection and loving incoherencies; and if Jack\nhad ever received it he would doubtless have understood and kissed\nevery word, and worn the white messenger close to his heart. But between\nwriting letters and sending them, there were in those days intervals\nfull of impossibilities. Love then had to be taken on trust. Rarely,\nindeed, could it send assurances of fidelity and affection.\n\nJack’s letter brightened the day, and formed a new topic of\nconversation, until Ortiz returned in the evening. His disguise had\nenabled him to linger about the Plaza and monte table, and to hear and\nobserve all that was going on.\n\n“The city is enjoying itself, and making money,” he said, in reply\nto question from the Senora. “Certainly the San Antonians approve of\nliberty, but what would you do? In Rome one does not quarrel with the\nPope; in San Antonio one must approve of despotism, when Santa Anna\nparades himself there.”\n\n“Has he made any preparations for attacking the Alamo? Will the\nAmericans resist him?”\n\n“Senorita Antonia, he is erecting a battery on the river bank, three\nhundred yards from the Alamo. This morning, ere the ground was touched,\nhe reviewed his men in the Plaza. He stood on an elevation at the church\ndoor, surrounded by his officers and the priests, and unfurled the\nMexican flag.”\n\n“That was about eleven o’clock, Captain?”\n\n“Si, Senorita. You are precisely exact.”\n\n“I heard at that hour a dull roar of human voices--a roar like nothing\non earth but the distant roar of the ocean.”\n\n“To be sure; it was the shouting of the people. When all was still, Fray\nIgnatius blessed the flag, and sprinkled over it holy water. Then Santa\nAnna raised it to his lips and kissed it. Holy Maria! another shout.\nThen he crossed his sword upon the flag, and cried out--‘Soldados! you\nare here to defend this banner, which is the emblem of your holy faith\nand of your native land, against heretics, infidels and ungrateful\ntraitors. Do you swear to do it?’ And the whole army answered ‘Si! si!\njuramos!’ (yes, we swear.) Again he kissed the flag, and laid his sword\nacross it, and, to be sure, then another shout. It was a very clever\nthing, I assure you, Senora, and it sent every soldier to the battery\nwith a great heart.”\n\nThe Senora’s easily touched feelings were all on fire at the\ndescription. “I wish I could have seen the blessing of the banner,”\n she said; “it is a ceremony to fill the soul. I have always wept at it.\nMark, Antonia! This confirms what I assured you of--the Mexicans make\nwar with a religious feeling and a true refinement. And pray, Captain\nOrtiz, how will the Americans oppose these magnificent soldiers, full of\npiety and patriotism?”\n\n“They have the Alamo, and one hundred and eighty-three men in it.”\n\n“And four thousand men against them?”\n\n“Si. May the Virgin de los Remedios [4] be their help! An urgent appeal\nfor assistance was sent to Fanning at Goliad. Senor Navarre, took it on\na horse fleet as the wind. You will see that on the third day he will be\nsmoking in his balcony, in the way which is usual to him.”\n\n“Will Fanning answer the appeal?”\n\n“If the answer be permitted him. But Urrea may prevent. Also other\nthings.”\n\nSanta Anna entered San Antonio on Tuesday the twenty-third of February,\n1836, and by the twenty-seventh the siege had become a very close one.\nEntrenched encampments encircled the doomed men in the Alamo, and from\ndawn to sunset the bombardment went on. The tumult of the fight--the\nhurrying in and out of the city--the clashing of church bells between\nthe booming of cannon--these things the Senora and her daughters could\nhear and see; but all else was for twelve days mere surmise. But only\none surmise was possible, when it was known that the little band of\ndefiant heroes were fighting twenty, times their own number--that no\nhelp could come to them--that the Mexicans were cutting off their water,\nand that their provisions were getting very low. The face of Ortiz grew\nconstantly more gloomy, and yet there was something of triumph in his\ntone as he told the miserably anxious women with what desperate valor\nthe Americans were fighting; and how fatally every one of their shots\ntold.\n\nOn Saturday night, the fifth of March, he called Antonia aside, and\nsaid, “My Senorita, you have a great heart, and so I speak to you. The\nend is close. To-day the Mexicans succeeded in getting a large cannon\nwithin gunshot of the Alamo, just where it is weakest. Senor Captain\nCrockett has stood on the roof all day, and as the gunners have advanced\nto fire it he has shot them down. A group of Americans were around him;\nthey loaded rifles and passed them to him quickly as he could fire them.\nSanta Anna was in a fury past believing. He swore then ‘by every saint\nin heaven or hell’ to enter the Alamo to-morrow. Senor Navarro says he\nis raging like a tiger, and that none of his officers dare approach\nhim. The Senor bade me tell you that to-morrow night he will be here to\nescort you to Gonzales; for no American will his fury spare; he knows\nneither sex nor age in his passions. And when the Alamo falls, the\nsoldiers will spread themselves around for plunder, or shelter, and\nthis empty house is sure to attract them. The Senorita sees with her own\nintelligence how things must take place.”\n\n“I understand, Captain. Will you go with us?”\n\n“I will have the Jersey wagon ready at midnight. I know the horses.\nBefore sun-up we shall have made many miles.”\n\nThat night as Antonia and her sister sat in the dark together, Antonia\nsaid: “Isabel, tomorrow the Alamo will fall. There is no hope for the\npoor, brave souls there. Then Santa Anna will kill every American.”\n\n“Oh, dear Antonia, what is to become of us? We shall have no home,\nnothing to eat, nowhere to sleep. I think we shall die. Also, there is\nmi madre. How I do pity her!”\n\n“She is to be your care, Isabel. I shall rely on you to comfort and\nmanage her. I will attend to all else. We are going to our father, and\nThomas--and Luis.”\n\nYes, and after all I am very tired of this dreadful life. It is a kind\nof convent. One is buried alive here, and still not safe. Do you really\nimagine that Luis is with my father and Thomas?”\n\n“I feel sure of it.”\n\n“What a great enjoyment it will be for me to see him again!”\n\n“And how delighted he will be! And as it is necessary that we go,\nIsabel, we must make the best of the necessity. Try and get mi madre to\nfeel this.”\n\n“I can do that with a few words, and tears, and kisses. Mi madre is like\none’s good angel--very easy to persuade.”\n\n“And now we must try and sleep, queridita.”\n\n“Are you sure there is no danger to-night, Antonia?”\n\n“Not to-night. Say your prayer, and sleep in God’s presence. There\nis yet nothing to fear. Ortiz and Lopez Navarro are watching every\nmovement.”\n\nBut at three o’clock in the morning, the quiet of their rest was broken\nby sharp bugle calls. The stars were yet in the sky, and all was so\nstill that they thrilled the air like something unearthly. Antonia\nstarted up, and ran to the roof. Bugle was answering bugle; and their\ntones were imperative and cruel, as if they were blown by evil spirits.\nIt was impossible to avoid the feeling that the call was a PREDESTINED\nsummons, full of the notes of calamity. She was weighed down by this\nsorrowful presentiment, because, as yet, neither experience nor years\nhad taught her that PREDESTINED ILLS ARE NEVER LOST.\n\nThe unseen moving multitudes troubled the atmosphere between them. In\nwild, savage gusts, she heard the military bands playing the infamous\nDequelo, whose notes of blood and fire commingled, shrieked in every\near--“NO QUARTER! NO QUARTER!” A prolonged shout, the booming of cannon,\nan awful murmurous tumult, a sense of horror, of crash and conflict,\nanswered the merciless, frenzied notes, and drowned them in the shrieks\nand curses they called for.\n\nIt was yet scarcely dawn. Her soul, moved by influences so various and\nso awful, became almost rebellious. Why did God permit such cruelties?\nDid He know? Would He allow a handful of men to be overpowered by\nnumbers? Being omnipotent, would He not in some way, at least, make the\nfight equal? The instinct of her anglo-American nature revolted at the\nunfairness of the struggle. Even her ejaculations to heaven were in this\nspirit. “It is so unjust,” she murmured; “surely the Lord of Hosts will\nprevent a fight which must be a massacre.”\n\nAs she went about the simple preparations for their breakfast, she wept\ncontinuously--tears of indignation and sorrow--tears coming from the\nstrength of feeling, rather than its weakness. The Senora could eat\nnothing. Isabel was white with terror. They wandered from window to\nwindow in the last extremity of anxiety.\n\nAbout seven o’clock they saw Ortiz pass the house. There were so many\npeople on the road he could not find an opportunity to enter for some\ntime. He had been in the city all night. He had watched the movement of\nthe troops in the starlight. As he drank a cup of chocolate, he said:\n\n“It was just three o’clock, Senorita, when the Matamoras battalion was\nmoved forward. General Cos supported it with two thousand men.\n\n“But General Cos was paroled by these same Americans who are now in the\nAlamo; and his life was spared on condition that he would not bear arms\nagainst them again.”\n\n“It is but one lie, one infamy more. When I left the city, about four\nthousand men were attacking the Alamo. The infantry, in columns, were\ndriven up to the walls by the cavalry which surrounded them.”\n\n“The Americans! Is there any hope for them?”\n\n“The mercy of God remains, Senorita. That is all. The Alamo is not as\nthe everlasting hills. What men have made, men can also destroy. Senor\nNavarro is in the church, praying for the souls that are passing every\nmoment.”\n\n“He ought to have been fighting. To help the living is better than to\npray for the dead.”\n\n“Permit me to assure you, Senorita Antonia, that no man has done more for\nthe living. In time of war, there must be many kinds of soldiers. Senor\nNavarro has given nearly all, that he possesses for the hope of freedom.\nHe has done secret service of incalculable value.”\n\n“Secret service! I prefer those who have the courage of their\nconvictions, and who, stand by them publicly.”\n\n“This is to be considered, Senorita; the man who can be silent can also\nspeak when the day for speaking arrives.” No one opposed this statement.\nIt did not seem worth while to discuss opinions, while the terrible\nfacts of the position were appealing to every sense.\n\nAs the day went on, the conflict evidently became closer and fiercer.\nOrtiz went back to the city, and the three lonely women knelt upon the\nhouse-top, listening in terror to the tumult of the battle. About noon\nthe firing ceased, and an awful silence--a silence that made the ears\nache to be relieved of it--followed.\n\n“All is over!” moaned Antonia, and she covered her face with her hands\nand sobbed bitterly. Isabel had already exhausted tears. The Senora,\nwith her crucifix in her hand, was praying for the poor unfortunates\ndying without prayer.\n\nDuring the afternoon, smoke and flame, and strange and sickening odors\nwere blown northward of the city, and for some time it seemed probable\nthat a great conflagration would follow the battle. How they longed for\nsome one to come! The utmost of their calamity would be better than the\nintolerable suspense. But hour after hour went past, and not even Ortiz\narrived. They began to fear that both he and Navarro had been discovered\nin some disloyalty and slain, and Antonia was heartsick when she\nconsidered the helplessness of their situation.\n\nStill, in accordance with Navarro’s instructions, they dressed for\nthe contemplated journey, and sat in the dark, anxiously listening for\nfootsteps. About eleven o’clock Navarro and Ortiz came together. Ortiz\nwent for the horses, and Navarro sat down beside, the Senora. She asked\nhim, in a low voice, what had taken place, and he answered:\n\n“Everything dreadful, everything cruel, and monstrous, and inhuman!\nAmong the angels in heaven there is sorrow and anger this night.”\n His voice had in it all the pathos of tears, but tears mingled with a\nburning indignation.\n\n“The Alamo has fallen!”\n\n“Senorita Antonia, I would give my soul to undo this day’s work. It is a\ndisgrace to Mexico which centuries cannot wipe out.”\n\n“The Americans?”\n\n“Are all with the Merciful One.”\n\n“Not one saved?”\n\n“Not one.”\n\n“Impossible!”\n\n“I will tell you. It is right to tell the whole world such an infamy.\nIf I had little children I would take them on my knee and teach them\nthe story. I heard it from the lips of one wet-shod with their blood,\ndripping crimson from the battle--my own cousin, Xavier. He was with\nGeneral Castrillon’s division. They began their attack at four in the\nmorning, and after two hours’ desperate fighting succeeded in reaching a\ncourtyard of the Alamo.\n\n“They found the windows and doors barricaded with bags of earth. Behind\nthese the Americans fought hand to hand with despairing valor. Ramires,\nSiesma and Batres led the columns, and Santa Anna gave the signal of\nbattle from a battery near the bridge. When the second charge was driven\nback, he became furious. He put himself in front of the men, and with\nshouts and oaths led them to the third charge. Xavier said that he\ninspired them with his own frenzy. They reached the foot of the wall,\nand the ladders were placed in position. The officers fell to the rear\nand forced the men to ascend them. As they reached the top they were\nstabbed, and the ladders overturned. Over and over, and over again these\nattempts were made, until the garrison in the Alamo were exhausted with\nthe struggle.”\n\nNavarro paused a few minutes, overpowered by his emotions. No one spoke.\nHe could see Antonia’s face, white as a spirit’s, in the dim light, and\nhe knew that Isabel was weeping and that the Senora had taken his hand.\n\n“At last, at the hour of ten, the outer wall was gained. Then, room by\nroom was taken with slaughter incredible. There were fourteen Americans\nin the hospital. They fired their rifles and pistols from their pallets\nwith such deadly aim that Milagros turned a cannon shotted with grape\nand canister upon them. They were blown to pieces, but at the entrance\nof the door they left forty dead Mexicans.”\n\n“Ah Senor, Senor! tell me no more. My heart can not endure it.”\n\n“Mi madre,” answered Isabel, “we must hear it all. Without it, one\ncannot learn to hate Santa Anna sufficiently”; and her small, white\nteeth snapped savagely, as she touched the hand of Lopez with an\nimperative “Proceed.”\n\n“Colonel Bowie was helpless in bed. Two Mexican officers fired at him,\nand one ran forward to stab him ere he died. The dying man caught his\nmurderer by the hair of his head, and plunged his knife into his heart.\nThey went to judgment at the same moment.”\n\n“I am glad of it! Glad of it! The American would say to the Almighty:\n‘Thou gavest me life, and thou gavest me freedom; freedom, that is the\nnobler gift of the two. This man robbed me of both.’ And God is just.\nThe Judge of the whole earth will do right.”\n\n“At noon, only six of the one hundred and eighty-three were left alive.\nThey were surrounded by Castrillon and his soldiers. Xavier says his\ngeneral was penetrated with admiration for these heroes. He spoke\nsympathizingly to Crockett, who stood in an angle of the fort, with his\nshattered rifle in his right hand, and his massive knife, dripping with\nblood, in his left. His face was gashed, his white hair crimson with\nblood; but a score of Mexicans, dead and dying, were around him. At his\nside was Travis, but so exhausted that he was scarcely alive.\n\n“Castrillon could not kill these heroes. He asked their lives of Santa\nAnna, who stood with a scowling, savage face in this last citadel of\nhis foes. For answer, he turned to the men around him, and said, with a\nmalignant emphasis: ‘Fire!’ It was the last volley. Of the defenders of\nthe Alamo, not one is left.”\n\nA solemn silence followed. For a few minutes it was painful in its\nintensity. Isabel broke it. She spoke in a whisper, but her voice was\nfull of intense feeling. “I wish indeed the whole city had been burnt\nup. There was a fire this afternoon; I would be glad if it were burning\nyet.”\n\n“May God pardon us all, Senorita! That was a fire which does not go out.\nIt will burn for ages. I will explain myself. Santa Anna had the dead\nAmericans put into ox-wagons and carried to an open field outside\nthe city. There they were burnt to ashes. The glorious pile was still\ncasting lurid flashes and shadows as I passed it.”\n\n“I will hear no more! I will hear no more!” cried the Senora. “And I\nwill go away from here. Ah, Senor, why do you not make haste? In a few\nhours we shall have daylight again. I am in a terror. Where is Ortiz?”\n\n“The horses are not caught in a five minutes, Senora. But listen, there\nis the roll of the wagon on the flagged court. All, then, is ready.\nSenora, show now that you are of a noble house, and in this hour of\nadversity be brave, as the Flores have always been.”\n\nShe was pleased by the entreaty, and took his arm with a composure\nwhich, though assumed, was a sort of strength. She entered the wagon\nwith her daughters, and uttered no word of complaint. Then Navarro\nlocked the gate, and took his seat beside Ortiz. The prairie turf\ndeadened the beat of their horses’ hoofs; they went at a flying pace,\nand when the first pallid light of morning touched the east, they had\nleft San Antonio far behind and were nearing the beautiful banks of the\nCibolo.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. GOLIAD.\n\n        “How sleep the brave who sink to rest\n         By all their country’s wishes bless’d?\n            *   *   *   *   *\n\n         By fairy hands their knell is rung;\n         By forms unseen their dirge is sung.\n         There Honor comes, a pilgrim gray,\n         To bless the turf that wraps their clay;\n         And Freedom shall awhile repair,\n         To dwell a weeping hermit there.”\n\n        “How shall we rank thee upon glory’s page?\n         Thou more than soldier, and just less than sage.”\n\n        “Grief fills the room up of my absent child;\n         Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me;\n         Remembers me of all his gracious parts.”\n\nNear midnight, on March the ninth, the weary fugitives arrived at\nGonzales. They had been detained by the deep mud in the bottom lands,\nand by the extreme exhaustion of the ladies, demanding some hours’ rest\neach day. The village was dark and quiet. Here and there the glimmer\nof a candle, now and then the call of a sentry, or the wail of a child\nbroke the mysterious silence.\n\nOrtiz appeared to know the ground perfectly. He drove without hesitation\nto a log house in which a faint thread of light was observable, and\nas he approached it he gave a long, peculiar whistle. The door was\ninstantly thrown open, and, as the wagon stopped, two men stepped\neagerly to it. In another instant the Senora was weeping in her\nhusband’s arms, and Isabel laughing and crying and murmuring her sweet\nsurprises into the ear of the delighted Luis. When their wraps had been\nremoved from the wagon, Ortiz drove away, leaving Navarro and Antonia\nstanding by the little pile of ladies’ luggage.\n\n“I will take charge of all, Senorita. Alas! How weary you are!”\n\n“It is nothing, Senor. Let me thank you for your great kindness.”\n\n“Senorita, to be of service to you is my good fortune. If it were\nnecessary, my life for your life, and I would die happy.”\n\nShe had given him her hand with her little speech of thanks, and he\nraised it to his lips. It was an act of homage that he might have\noffered to a saint, but in it Lopez unconsciously revealed to Antonia\nthe secret love in his heart. For he stood in the glow of light from\nthe open door, and his handsome face showed, as in a glass darkly, the\ntenderness and hopelessness of his great affection. She was touched by\nthe discovery, and though she had a nature faithful as sunrising she\ncould not help a feeling of kindly interest in a lover so reticent, so\nwatchful, so forgetful of himself.\n\nThe log cabin in which they found shelter was at least a resting-place.\nA fire of cedar logs burned upon the hearth, and there was a bed in the\nroom, and a few rude chairs covered with raw hide. But the Senora had\na happy smile on her weary face. She ignored the poverty of her\nsurroundings. She had her Roberto, and, for this hour at least, had\nforgiven fate.\n\n\nPresently the coffee-pot was boiling, and Doctor Worth and Luis brought\nout their small store of corn-bread and their tin camp-cups, and the\nweary women ate and drank, and comforted themselves in the love and\nprotection at their side. Doctor Worth sat by his wife, and gave Antonia\nhis hand. Isabel leaned her pretty head against Luis, and listened with\nhappy smiles to his low words:\n\n“Charming little one, your lips are two crimson curtains. Between\ncurtain and curtain my kiss is waiting. Give it to me.”\n\n“Eyes of my soul, to-night the world begins again for me.”\n\n“At this blessed hour of God, I am the happiest man he has made.”\n\n“As for me, here in this dear, white hand I put my heart.”\n\nIs there any woman who cannot imagine Isabel’s shy glances, and the low,\nsweet words in which she answered such delightful protestations? And\nsoon, to add a keener zest to his happiness, Luis began to be a little\njealous.\n\n“With us is Dias de Bonilla. Do you remember, my beloved one, that you\ndanced with him once?”\n\n“How can you say a thing so offensive?”\n\n“Yes, dear, at the Senora Valdez’s.”\n\n“It may be. I have forgotten.”\n\n“Too well he remembers. He has dared to sing a serenade to your\nmemory--well, truly, he did not finish it, and but for the Senor Doctor,\nI should have taught him that Isabel is not a name for his lips to\nutter. Here, he may presume to come into your presence. Will you receive\nhim with extreme haughtiness? It would be a great satisfaction to me.”\n\n“The poor fellow! Why should I make him miserable? You should not be\njealous, Luis.”\n\n“If you smile on him--the least little smile--he will think you are in\nlove with him. He is such a fool, I assure you. I am very distressed\nabout this matter, my angel.”\n\n“I will tell you Luis--when the myrtle-tree grows figs, and the fig-tree\nis pink with myrtle flowers, then I may fall in love with Dias de\nBonilla--if I can take the trouble.”\n\nNo one heeded this pretty, extravagant talk. It was a thing apart from\nthe more serious interests discussed by Doctor Worth and his wife and\neldest daughter. And when Ortiz and Navarro joined the circle, the\nstory of the fall of the Alamo was told again, and Luis forgot his own\nhappiness, and wept tears of anger and pity for the dead heroes.\n\n“This brutal massacre was on the morning of the sixth, you say,\nNavarro?”\n\n“Last Sabbath morning, Senor. Mass was being offered in the churches,\nand Te Deums sung while it went on.”\n\n“A mass to the devil it was,” said Ortiz.\n\n“Now, I will tell you something. On the morning of the second, Thomas\nwas in Washington. A convention sitting there declared, on that day,\nthe independence of Texas, and fifty-five out of fifty-six votes elected\nGeneral Houston Commander-in-Chief.”\n\n“Houston! That is the name of victory! Gracias a Dios!” cried Navarro.\n\n“It is probable that the news of this movement influenced Santa Anna to\nsuch barbarity.”\n\n“It is his nature to be brutal.”\n\n“True, Ortiz; yet I can imagine how this proclamation would incense him.\nOn the morning of the sixth, the convention received the last express\nsent by poor Travis from the Alamo. It was of the most thrilling\ncharacter, breathing the very spirit of patriotism and courage--and\ndespair. In less than an hour, Houston, with a few companions, was on\nhis way to the Alamo. At the same time he sent an express to Fannin,\nurging him to meet him on the Cibolo. Houston will be here to-morrow.”\n\n“Then he will learn that all help is too late.”\n\nBut Houston had learned it in his own way before he reached Gonzales;\nfor Travis had stated that as long as the Alamo could be held, signal\nguns would be fired at sunrising; and it is a well-authenticated fact\nthat these guns were heard by trained ears for more than one hundred\nmiles across the prairie. Houston, whose senses were keen as the Indians\nwith whom he had long lived knew when he was within reach of the sound;\nand he rose very early, and with his ear close to the ground waited in\nintense anxiety for the dull, rumbling murmur which would tell him the\nAlamo still held out. His companions stood at some distance, still as\nstatues, intently watching him. The sun rose. He had listened in vain;\nnot the faintest sound did his ear detect.\n\n“The Alamo has fired its last gun,” he said, on rejoining his\ncompanions.\n\n“And the men, General?”\n\n“They have died like men. You may be sure of that.”\n\nAt Gonzales he heard the particulars. And he saw that the news had\nexerted a depressing influence upon the troops there. He called them\ntogether. He spoke to them of the brutal tragedy, and he invested its\nhorrors with the grandeur of eternal purpose and the glory of heroic\nsacrifice.\n\n“They were soldiers,” he cried; “and they died like soldiers. Their\nnames will be the morning stars of American history. They will live for\never in the red monument of the Alamo.” He looked like a lion, with a\ngloomy stare; his port was fierce, and his eyes commanded all he viewed.\n“Vengeance remains to us! We have declared our independence, and it must\nbe maintained.”\n\nHe immediately sent off another express to Fannin; apprised him of the\nfall of the Alamo; ordered him to blow up Goliad and fall back upon\nGonzales. Then he sent wagons into the surrounding country, to transport\nthe women and children to the eastern settlements; for he knew well what\natrocities would mark every mile of Santa Anna’s progress through the\ncountry.\n\nThese wagons, with their helpless loads, were to rendezvous at Peach\nCreek, ten miles from Gonzales; where also he expected Fannin and his\neight hundred and sixty men to join him. This addition would make the\nAmerican force nearly twelve hundred strong. Besides which, Fannin’s\nlittle army was of the finest material, being composed mostly of\nenthusiastic volunteers from Georgia and Alabama; young men, who, like\nDare Grant and John Worth, were inspired with the idea of freedom, or\nthe spread of Americanism, or the fanaticism of religious liberty of\nconscience--perhaps, even, with hatred of priestly domination. Houston\nfelt that he would be sufficient for Santa Anna when the spirit of this\ncompany was added to the moral force of men driven from their homes and\nfamilies to fight for the lands they had bought and the rights which had\nbeen guaranteed them.\n\nSo he watched the horizon anxiously for Fannin’s approach, often\nlaying his ear to the ground to listen for what he could not see. And,\nimpatient as he was for their arrival, the Senora was more so. She\ndeclared that her sufferings would be unendurable but for this hope. The\none question on her lips, the one question in her eyes, was, “Are they\ncoming?” And Antonia, though she did not speak of her private hopes, was\nequally anxious. Brother and lover were both very dear to her. And to\nhave the whole family together would be in itself a great help. Whatever\ntheir deprivations and fatigues, they could comfort each other with\ntheir affection.\n\nEvery day wagon-loads of women and children joined the camp, and the\nmarch eastward was very slow. But no circumstance extols more loudly the\nbravery and tenderness of these American soldiers than the patience\nwith which this encumbrance was endured. Men worn out with watching and\nforaging were never too weary to help some mother still more weary, or\nto carry some little child whose swollen feet would no longer aid it.\n\nOne night they rested at a little place on the Colorado. In one room\nof a deserted cabin Houston sat with Major Hockly, dictating to him a\nmilitary dispatch. They had no candles, and Houston was feeding the fire\nwith oak splinters, to furnish light enough for their necessity. In the\nother room, the Worth family were gathered. Antonia, in preparing for\ntheir journey, had wisely laid a small mattress and a couple of pillows\nin the wagon; and upon this mattress the Senora and Isabel were resting.\nDoctor Worth and Thomas sat by the fire talking of Fannin’s delay; and\nAntonia was making some corn-meal cakes for their supper.\n\nWhen the Senora’s portion was given to her she put it aside, and lifted\nher eyes to Antonia’s face. They asked the question forever in her\nheart, “Is Jack coming?” and Antonia pitifully shook her head.\n\nThen the poor woman seemed to have reached the last pitch of endurance.\n“Let me die!” she cried. “I can bear life no longer.” To Mary and the\nsaints she appealed with a passionate grief that was distressing to\nwitness. All the efforts of her husband and her children failed to sooth\nher; and, as often happens in a complication of troubles, she seized\nupon the most trifling as the text of her complaint.\n\n“I cannot eat corn bread; I have always detested it. I am hungry. I\nam perishing for my chocolate. And I have no clothing. I am ashamed\nof myself. I thank the saints I have no looking-glass. Oh, Roberto!\nRoberto! What have you done to your Maria?”\n\n“My dear wife! My dear, dear wife! Be patient a little longer. Think,\nlove, you are not alone. There are women here far more weary, far more\nhungry; several who, in the confusion, have lost their little children;\nothers who are holding dying babes in their arms.”\n\n“Giver of all good! give me patience. I have to say to you that other\nwomen’s sorrows do not make me grateful for my own. And Santa Maria has\nbeen cruel to me. Another more cruel, who can find? I have confessed to\nher my heartache about Juan; entreated her to bring my boy to me. Has\nshe done it?”\n\n“My darling Maria.”\n\n“Grace of God, Roberto! It is now the twenty-third of March; I have been\nseventeen days wandering with my daughters like very beggars. If only I\nhad had the discretion to remain in my own house!”\n\n“Maria, Lopez will tell you that Fray Ignatius and the brothers are in\npossession of it. He saw them walking about the garden reading their\nbreviaries.”\n\nAt this moment General Houston, in the opposite room was dictating:\n“Before God, I have found the darkest hours of my life. For forty-eight\nhours I have neither eaten an ounce of anything, nor have I slept.” The\nSenora’s sobbing troubled him. He rose to close the door, and saw two\nmen entering. One leaned upon the other, and appeared to be at the point\nof death.\n\n“Where is there a doctor, General?”\n\n“In that room, sir. Have you brought news of Fannin?”\n\n“I have.”\n\n“Leave your comrade with the doctor, and report.”\n\nThe entrance of the wounded man silenced the Senora. She turned her\nface to the wall and refused to eat. Isabel sat by her side and held her\nhand. The doctor glanced at it as he turned away. It had been so plump\nand dimpled and white. It was now very thin and white with exposure.\nIt told him far better than complaining, how much the poor woman had\nsuffered. He went with a sigh to his patient.\n\n“Stabbed with a bayonet through the shoulder--hard riding from\nGoliad--no food--no rest--that tells the whole story, doctor.”\n\nIt was all he could say. A fainting fit followed. Antonia procured some\nstimulant, and when consciousness returned, assisted her father to dress\nthe wound. Their own coffee was gone, but she begged a cup from some one\nmore fortunate; and after the young man had drunk it, and had eaten\na little bread, he was inclined to make light of his wound and his\nsufferings.\n\n“Glad to be here at all,” he said. “I think I am the only one out of\nfive hundred.”\n\n“You cannot mean that you are of Fannin’s command?”\n\n“I WAS of Fannin’s command. Every man in it has been shot. I escaped by\na kind of miracle.”\n\nThe doctor looked at the Senora. She seemed to be asleep. “Speak low,”\n he said, “but tell me all.”\n\nThe man sat upon the floor with his back against the wall. The doctor\nstooped over him. Antonia and Isabel stood beside their father.\n\n“We heard of Urrea’s approach at San Patricio. The Irish people of that\nsettlement welcomed Urrea with great rejoicing. He was a Catholic--a\ndefender of the faith. But the American settlers in the surrounding\ncountry fled, and Fannin heard that five hundred women and children,\nfollowed by the enemy, were trying to reach the fortress of Goliad.\nHe ordered Major Ward, with the Georgia battalions, to go and meet the\nfugitives. Many of the officers entreated him not to divide his men for\na report which had come by way of the faithless colony of San Patricio.\n\n“But Fannin thought the risk ought to be taken. He took it, and the five\nhundred women and children proved to be a regiment of Mexican dragoons.\nThey surrounded our infantry on every side, and after two days’\ndesperate fighting, the Georgia battalions were no more. In the\nmeantime, Fannin got the express telling him of the fall of the Alamo,\nand ordering him to unite with General Houston. That might have been a\npossible thing with eight hundred and sixty men, but it was not possible\nwith three hundred and sixty. However, we made the effort, and on the\ngreat prairie were attacked by the enemy lying in ambush there. Entirely\nencircled by them, yet still fighting and pressing onward, we defended\nourselves until our ammunition gave out. Then we accepted the terms\nof capitulation offered by Urrea, and were marched back to Goliad as\nprisoners of war. Santa Anna ordered us all to be shot.”\n\n“But you were prisoners of war?”\n\n“Urrea laughed at the articles, and said his only intention in them was\nto prevent the loss of Mexican blood. Most of his officers remonstrated\nwith with{sic} him, but he flew into a passion at Miralejes. ‘The\nSenor Presidente’s orders are not to be trifled with. By the Virgin of\nGuadelupe!’ he cried, ‘it would be as much as my own life was worth to\ndisobey them.’\n\n“It gave the Mexican soldiers pleasure to tell us these things, and\nthough we scarcely believed such treachery possible, we were very\nuneasy. On the eighth day after the surrender, a lovely Sunday morning,\nwe were marched out of the fort on pretence of sending us to Louisiana;\naccording to the articles of surrender, and we were in high spirits at\nthe prospect.\n\n“But I noticed that we were surrounded by a double row of soldiers, and\nthat made me suspicious. In a few moments, Fannin was marched into the\ncentre, and told to sit down on a low stool. He felt that his hour had\ncome. He took his watch and his purse, and gave them to some poor woman\nwho stood outside lamenting and praying for the poor Americans. I\nshall never forget the calmness and brightness of his face. The Mexican\ncolonel raised his sword, the drums beat, and the slaughter began. Fifty\nmen at a time were shot; and those whom the guns missed or crippled,\nwere dispatched with the bayonet or lance.”\n\n“You escaped. How?”\n\n“When the lips of the officer moved to give the order: Fire! I fell upon\nmy face as if dead. As I lay, I was pierced by a bayonet through the\nshoulder, but I made no sign of life. After the execution, the camp\nfollowers came to rob the dead. A kind-hearted Mexican woman helped me\nto reach the river. I found a horse tied there, and I took it. I have\nbeen on the point of giving up life several times, but I met a man\ncoming here with the news to Houston, and he helped me to hold out.”\n\nThe doctor was trembling with grief and anger, and he felt Antonia’s\nhand on his shoulder.\n\n\n“My friend,” he whispered, “did you know JOHN WORTH?”\n\n“Who did not know him in Fannin’s camp? Any of us would have been glad\nto save poor Jack; and he had a friend who refused to live without him.”\n\n“Dare Grant?”\n\n“That was the man, young lady. Grant was a doctor, and the Mexicans\nwanted doctors. They offered him his life for his services, but he would\nnot have it unless his friend’s life also was spared. They were shot\nholding each other’s hands, and fell together. I was watching their\nfaces at the moment. There wasn’t a bit of fear in them.”\n\nThe Senora rose, and came as swiftly as a spirit to them. She looked\nlike a woman walking in her sleep. She touched the stranger. “I heard\nyou. You saw Dare Grant die. But my boy! My boy! Where is my Juan?”\n\n“Maria, darling.”\n\n“Don’t speak, Roberto. Where is my Juan? Juan Worth?”\n\n“Madam. I am sorry enough, God knows. Juan Worth--was shot.”\n\nThen the wretched mother threw up her hands, and with an awful cry\nfell to the ground. It was hours ere she recovered consciousness, and\nconsciousness only restored her to misery.\n\nThe distress of the father, the brother and sisters of the dead youth\nwas submerged in the speechless despair of the mother. She could not\nswallow food; she turned away from the the{sic} sympathy of all who\nloved her. Even Isabel’s caresses were received with an apathy which was\nterrifying. With the severed curl of her boy’s hair in her fingers, she\nsat in tearless, voiceless anguish.\n\nPoor Antonia, weighed down with the double loss that had come to her,\nfelt, for the first time, as if their condition was utterly hopeless.\nThe mental picture of her brother and her lover meeting their tragic\ndeath hand in hand, their youth and beauty, their courage and fidelity,\nwas constantly before her. With all the purity and strength of her true\nheart, she loved Dare; but she did not for a moment wish that he had\ntaken a different course. “It is just what I should have expected from\nhim,” she said to Isabel. “If he had let poor Jack die alone, I\ncould never have loved him in the same way again. But oh, Isabel, how\nmiserable I am?”\n\n“Sweet Antonia, I can only weep with you. Think of this; it was on last\nSunday morning. Do you remember how sad you were?”\n\n“I was in what seemed to be an unreasonable distress. I went away to\nweep. My very thoughts were tired with their sorrowful journeys up and\ndown my mind, trying to find out hope and only meeting despair. Oh, my\nbrave Jack! Oh, my dear Dare, what a cruel fate was your’s!”\n\n“And mi madre, Antonia? I fear, indeed, that she will lose her senses.\nShe will not speak to Thomas, nor even to me. She has not said a prayer\nsince Jack’s death. She cannot sleep. I am afraid of her, Antonia.”\n\n“To-night we are to move further east; perhaps the journey may waken her\nout of this trance of grief. I can see that our father is wretched\nabout her; and Thomas wanders in and out of the room as if his heart was\nbroken.”\n\n“Thomas loved Jack. Luis told me that he sat with him and Lopez, and\nthat he sobbed like a woman. But, also, he means a great revenge. None\nof the men slept last night. They stood by the camp-fires talking.\nSometimes I went to the door and looked out. How awful they were in the\nblaze and darkness! I think, indeed, they could have conquered Santa\nAnna very easily.”\n\nIsabel had not misjudged the spirit of the camp. The news of the\nmassacre at Goliad was answered by a call for vengeance that nothing\nbut vengeance could satisfy. On the following day Houston addressed his\nlittle army. He reminded them that they were the children of the heroes\nwho fought for liberty at Yorktown, and Saratoga, and Bunker Hill. He\nmade a soul-stirring review of the events that had passed; he explained\nto them their situation, and the designs of the enemy, and how he\nproposed to meet them.\n\nHis voice, loud as a trumpet with a silver sound, inspired all who heard\nit with courage. His large, bright visage, serious but hopeful, seemed\nto sun the camp. “They live too long,” he cried, “who outlive freedom.\nAnd I promise you that you shall have a full cup of vengeance. For\nevery man that fell fighting at the Alamo, for every one treacherously\nslaughtered at Goliad, you shall be satisfied. If I seem to be flying\nbefore the enemy now, it is for his destruction. Three Mexican armies\nunited, we cannot fight. We can fight them singly. And every mile we\nmake them follow us weakens them, separates them, confuses them. The low\nlands of the Brazos, the unfordable streams, the morasses, the pathless\nwoods, are in league with us. And we must place our women and children\nin safety. Even if we have to carry them to General Gaines and the\nUnited States troops, we must protect them, first of all. I believe that\nwe shall win our freedom with our own hands; but if the worst come, and\nwe have to fall back to the Sabine, we shall find friends and backers\nthere. I know President Jackson, my old general, the unconquered\nChristian Mars! Do you think he will desert his countrymen? Never! If we\nshould need help, he has provided it. And the freedom of Texas is sure\nand certain. It is at hand. Prepare to achieve it. We shall take up our\nmarch eastward in three hours.”\n\nRinging shouts answered the summons. The camp was in a tumult of\npreparation immediately; Houston was lending his great physical strength\nto the mechanical difficulties to be encountered. A crowd of men was\naround. Suddenly a woman touched him on the arm, and he straightened\nhimself and looked at her.\n\n“You will kill Santa Anna, General? You will kill this fiend who has\nescaped from hell! By the mother of Christ, I ask it.”\n\n“My dear madam!”\n\nHe was so moved with pity that he could not for a moment or two give\nher any stronger assurance. For this suppliant, pallid and frenzied with\nsorrow, was the once beautiful Senora Worth. He looked at her hollow\neyes, and shrunk form, and worn clothing, and remembered with a pang,\nthe lovely, gracious lady clad in satin and lace, with a jewelled comb\nin her fine hair and a jewelled fan in her beautiful hands, and a wave\nof pity and anger passed like a flame over his face.\n\n“By the memory of my own dear mother, Senora, I will make Santa Anna pay\nthe full price of his cruelties.”\n\n“Thank you, Senor”; and she glided away with her tearless eyes fixed\nupon the curl of black hair in her open palm.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. THE LOADSTONE IN THE BREAST.\n\n         “But to the hero, when his sword\n          Has won the battle for the free,\n          Thy voice sounds like a prophet’s word,\n          And in its hollow tones are heard.\n          The thanks of millions yet to be,”\n\n         “Who battled for the true and just,\n\n         “And grasps the skirts of happy chance,\n          And breasts the blows of circumstance.\n\n         “And lives to clutch the golden keys,\n          To mould a mighty state’s decrees.”\n\nThe memorial of wrongs, which resulted in the Declaration of Texan\nIndependence, was drawn up with statesmanlike ability by David G.\nBurnett, a native of New Jersey, a man of great learning, dignity, and\nexperience; who, as early as 1806, sailed from New York to join Miranda\nin his effort to give Spanish America liberty. The paper need not be\nquoted here. It gave the greatest prominence to the refusal of trial\nby jury, the failure too establish a system of public education, the\ntyranny of military law, the demand that the colonists should give up\narms necessary for their protection or their sustenance, the inciting\nof the Indians to massacre the American settlers, and the refusal of\nthe right to worship the Almighty according to the dictates of their\nown consciences. Burnett was elected Governor, and Houston felt that he\ncould now give his whole attention to military affairs.\n\nThe seat of Government was removed to Harrisburg, a small place on the\nBuffalo Bayou; and Houston was sure that this change would cause Santa\nAnna to diverge from his route to Nacogdoches. He dispatched orders to\nthe men scattered up and down the Brazos from Washington to Fort Bend--a\ndistance of eighty miles--to join him on the march to Harrisburg, and he\nstruck his own camp at the time he had specified.\n\nIn less than twenty-four hours they reached San Felipe, a distance of\ntwenty-eight miles. The suffering of the women and children on that\nmarch can never be told. Acts of heroism on the part of the men and of\nfortitude on the part of the women that are almost incredible, marked\nevery step of the way. The Senora sat in her wagon, speechless, and lost\nin a maze of melancholy anguish. She did not seem to heed want, or\ncold, or wet, or the utter misery of her surroundings. Her soul\nhad concentrated all its consciousness upon the strand of hair she\ncontinually smoothed through her fingers. Dr. Worth, in his capacity of\nphysician, accompanied the flying families, and he was thus able to pay\nsome attention to his distraught wife; but she answered nothing he said\nto her. If she looked at him, her eyes either flamed with anger, or\nexpressed something of the terror to be seen in the eyes of a hunted\nanimal. It was evident that her childish intelligence had seized upon\nhim as the most obvious cause of all her loss and misery.\n\nThe condition of a wife so beloved almost broke his heart. The tragic\ndeath of his dear son was not so hard to endure as this living woe at\nhis side. And when they reached San Felipe and found it in ashes, a\nbitter cry of hopeless suffering came from every woman’s lips. They\nhad thought to find there a little food, and a day’s sheltered\nresting-place. Even Antonia’s brave soul fainted, at the want and\nsuffering around her. She had gold, but it could not buy bread for the\nlittle ones, weeping with hunger and terrified by the fretfulness of\nmothers suffering the pangs of want and in the last stage of human\nweariness.\n\nIt was on this night Houston wrote: “I will do the best I can; but be\nassured the fame of Jackson could never compensate me for my anxiety and\nmental pain.” And yet, when he was told that a blind woman and her\nseven children had been passed by, and did not know the enemy were\napproaching, he delayed the march until men had been sent back to bring\nthem into safety.\n\nDuring these days of grief and privation Isabel’s nature grew to its\nfinest proportions. Her patient efforts to arouse her mother, and her\ncheerfulness under the loss of all comforts, were delightful. Besides\nwhich, she had an inexhaustible fund of sympathy for the babies. She was\nnever without one in her arms. Three mothers, who had died on the road,\nleft their children to her care. And it was wonderful and pitiful to\nsee the delicately nurtured girl, making all kinds of efforts to secure\nlittle necessaries for the children she had elected to care for.\n\n“The Holy Mother helps me,” she said to, Antonia. “She makes the poor\nlittle ones good, and I am not very tired.”\n\nAt San Felipe they were joined by nearly one hundred men, who also\nbrought word that a fine company were advancing to their aid from\nMississippi, under General Quitman; and that two large cannon, sent by\nthe people of Cincinnati, were within a few miles. And thus hoping and\nfearing, hungry and weary to the death, they reached, on the 16th of\nApril, after a march of eighteen miles, a place called McArley’s. They\nhad come over a boggy prairie under a cold rain, and were depressed\nbeyond expression. But there was a little shelter here for the women and\nchildren to sleep under. The men camped in the open. They had not a tent\nin their possession.\n\nAbout ten o’clock that night, Doctor Worth was sitting with his wife and\nchildren and Antonia in one corner of a room in a deserted cabin. He had\nthe Senora’s wasted hand in his own, and was talking to her. She sat\nin apathetic silence. It was impossible to tell whether she heard or\nunderstood him.\n\n“I wonder where Isabel is,” said Antonia; and with the words the girl\nentered the room. She had in her arms a little lad of four years old,\nsuffering the tortures of croup.\n\n“Mi madre,” she cried, “you know how to save him! He is dying! Save him!\nListen to me! The Holy Mother says so”; and she laid the child on her\nknee.\n\nA change like a flash of light passed over the Senora’s face. “The poor\nlittle one!” Her motherly instincts crushed down everything else. In the\nchild’s agony she forgot her own grief. With glad hearts the doctor and\nAntonia encouraged her in her good work, and when at length the sufferer\nhad been relieved and was sleeping against her breast, the Senora had\nwept. The stone from her heart had been rolled away by a little child.\nHer own selfish sorrow had been buried in a wave of holy, unselfish\nmaternal affection. The key to her nature had been found, and\nhenceforward Isabel brought to her every suffering baby.\n\nOn the next day they marched ten miles through a heavy rain, and arrived\nat Burnett’s settlement. The women had shelter, the men slept on the wet\nground--took the prairie without cover--with their arms in their hands.\nThey knew they were in the vicinity of Santa Anna, and all were ready\nto answer in an instant the three taps of the drum, which was the only\ninstrument of martial music in the camp, and which was never touched but\nby Houston.\n\nAnother day of eighteen miles brought them to within a short distance of\nHarrisburg. Santa Anna had just been there, and the place was in ashes.\nIt was evident to all, now, that the day and the hour was at hand.\nHouston first thought of the two hundred families he had in charge, and\nthey were quickly taken over the bayou. When he had seen the last one in\nthis comparative safety, he uttered so fervent a “Thank God!” that the\nmen around unconsciously repeated it. The bayou though narrow was twenty\nfeet deep, and the very home of alligators. There was only one small\nbridge in the vicinity. He intended its destruction, and thus to make\nhis little band and the deep, dangerous stream a double barrier between\nthe Mexicans and the women and children beyond them. It was after this\nduty he wrote:\n\n“This morning we are in preparation to meet Santa Anna. We will only\nbe about seven hundred to march, besides the camp guard. But we go\nto conquest. The troops are in fine spirits, and now is the time for\naction. I leave the result in the hands of an all-wise God, and I rely\nconfidently in his Providence.\n\n“SAM HOUSTON.”[5]\n\n\nThe women and children, under a competent guide, continued their march\neastward. But they were worn out. Many were unable to put their feet to\nthe ground. The wagons were crowded with these helpless ones. The Senora\nhad so far recovered as to understand that within a few hours Santa Anna\nand the Americans must meet. And, mentally led by Isabel’s passionate\nhatred, she now showed a vindictiveness beyond that of any other woman.\n\nShe spent hours upon her knees, imploring the saints, and the stars, and\nthe angel Michael, to fight against Santa Anna. To Isabel she whispered,\n“I have even informed the evil one where he may be found. The wretch who\nordered such infamies! He poisons the air of the whole world as he goes\nthrough it. I shall never be happy till I know that he is in purgatory.\nHe will be hated even there--and in a worse place, too. Yes, it is\npleasant to think of that! There will be many accusers of him there.\nI shall comfort myself with imagining his punishment. Isabel, do you\nbelieve with your heart that Senor Houston and the Americans will be\nstrong enough to kill him?”\n\n“Mi madre, I know it.”\n\n“Then do be a little delighted. How can you bear things with such a\nprovoking indifference? But as Luis is safe--”\n\n“Chito! Chito! Do not be cruel, mi madre. I would stab Santa Anna with\nmy own hands--very slowly, I would stab him. It would be so sweet. The\nSisters told me of a woman in the Holy Book, who smiled upon the one she\nhated, and gave him milk and butter, and when he slept, drove a great\nnail through his temples. I know how she felt. What a feast it would\nbe, to strike, and strike, and strike! I could drive ten, twenty, fifty\nnails, into Santa Anna, when I think of Juan.”\n\nNo one had before dared to breathe her boy’s name in her hearing. She\nherself had never spoken it. It fell upon the ears of both women like\na strain of forgotten music. They looked at each other with eyes that\nstirred memory and love to their sweetest depths. Almost in whispers\nthey began to talk of the dead boy, to recall how lovable, how charming,\nhow affectionate, how obedient he had been. Then the Senora broke\nopen the seals of her sorrow, and, with bitter reproaches on herself,\nconfessed that the kiss she had denied her Juan was a load of anguish\nupon her heart that she could not bear.\n\n“If I had only blessed him,” she moaned; “I had saved him from his\nmisfortune. A mother’s blessing is such a holy thing! And he knelt at my\nknees, and begged it. I can see his eyes in the darkness, when my eyes\nare shut. I can hear his voice when I am asleep. Isabel, I shall never\nbe happy till I see Juan again, and say to him, ‘Forgive me, dear one,\nforgive me, for I have suffered.’”\n\nBoth were weeping, but Isabel said, bravely: “I am sure that Juan does\nnot blame you now, mi madre. In the other world one understands better.\nAnd remember, also, the letter which he wrote you. His last thought was\nyours. He fell with your name on his lips. These things are certain. And\nwas it not good of Dare to die with him? A friend like that! Out of the\ntale-books who ever hears of such a thing? Antonia has wept much. In the\nnights, when she thinks I am asleep, I hear her. Have you seen that she\nhas grown white and thin? I think that my father is very unhappy about\nher.”\n\n“In an hour of mercy may the merciful One remember Dare Grant! I will\npray for his peace as long as I live. If he had left Juan--if he had\ncome back alone--I think indeed I should have hated him.”\n\n“That was also the opinion of Antonia--she would never have loved him\nthe same. I am sure she would not have married him.”\n\n“My good Antonia! Go bring her to me, Isabel. I want to comfort her. She\nhas been so patient with me. I have felt it--felt it every minute; and\nI have been stupid and selfish, and have forgotten that she too was\nsuffering.”\n\nThe next day it was found impossible to move. The majority of the\nwomen had husbands with the army. They had left their wives, to secure\neverlasting freedom for their children; but, even if Houston was\nvictorious, they might be wounded and need their help. To be near them\nin any case was the one thing about which they were positive.\n\n“We will not move another inch,” said a brave little Massachusetts\nwoman, who had been the natural leader of this domestic Exodus; “we\nwill rest ourselves a little here, and if the Mexicans want some\nextraordinary fighting they can have it; especially, if they come\nmeddling with us or our children. My husband told me just to get out of\nreach of shot and shell and wait there till we heard of the victory, and\nI am for doing THAT, and no other thing.”\n\nNearly two hundred women, bent upon their own way, are not to be taken\nany other way; and the few old men who had been sent to guide the party,\nand shoot what game was necessary for their support, surrendered at once\nto this feminine mutiny. Besides, the condition of the boys and girls\nbetween seven and fourteen was really a deplorable one. They were too\nold to be cared for as infants, and they had been obliged, with the\nstrength of children, to accomplish the labor of men and women. Many\nwere crippled in their feet, others were continually on the point of\nswooning.\n\nIt was now the 20th of April. The Senora and her daughters had been six\nweeks with the American army, exposed to all the privations which such\na life entailed. But the most obvious of these privations were, perhaps,\nthose which were most easily borne. Women endure great calamities better\nthan the little annoyances affecting those wants which are part and\nparcel of their sex or their caste. It was not the necessaries so\nmuch as the luxuries of life which the Senora missed--the changes of\nraiment--the privacy--the quiet--the regularity of events.\n\nDuring the whole of the 20th, there was almost a Sabbath stillness. It\nwas a warm, balmy day. The wearied children were under the wagons and\nunder the trees, sleeping the dead sleep of extreme exhaustion. The\nmothers, wherever it was possible, slept also. The guides were a\nlittle apart, listening and smoking. If they spoke, it was only in\nmonosyllables. Rest was so much more needed than food that little or no\nattempt was made to cook until near sundown.\n\nAt dawn next morning--nay, a little before dawn--when all was chill,\nand gray, and misty, and there was not a sound but the wailing of a sick\nchild, the Senora touched her daughters. Her voice was strange to them;\nher face solemnly happy.\n\n“Antonio! Isabel! I HAVE SEEN JUAN! I HAVE SEEN JUAN! My eyes were shut,\nbut I have seen him. He was a beautiful shadow, with a great, shadowy\nhost around him. He bent on me such eyes! Holy Mother! their love was\nunfathomable, and I heard his voice. It was far off, yet near. ‘Madre!’\nhe said, ‘TOMORROW YOU SHALL HEAR FROM US.’ Now I am happy. There are\nwords in my heart, but I cannot explain them to you. I know what they\nmean. I will weep no more. They put my Juan’s body in the grave, but\nthey have not buried HIM.”\n\nAll day she was silent and full of thought, but her face was smiling and\nhopeful, and she had the air of one waiting for some assured happiness.\nAbout three o’clock in the afternoon she stood up quickly and cried,\n“Hark! the battle has begun!” Every one listened intently, and after a\nshort pause the oldest of the guides nodded. “I’d give the rest of my\nlife to be young again,” he said, “just for three hours to be young, and\nbehind Houston!”\n\n“TO-MORROW WE SHALL HEAR.”\n\nThe words fell from the Senora’s lips with a singular significance.\nHer face and voice were the face and voice of some glad diviner,\ntriumphantly carrying her own augury. Under a little grove of trees\nshe walked until sunset, passing the beads of her rosary through her\nfingers, and mechanically whispering the prayers appointed. The act\nundoubtedly quieted her, but Antonia knew that she lay awake all night,\npraying for the living or the dead.\n\nAbout ten o’clock of the morning of the 22d, a horseman was seen coming\ntoward the camp at full speed. Women and children stood breathlessly\nwaiting his approach. No one could speak. If a child moved, the movement\nwas angrily reproved. The tension was too great to admit of a touch\nthrough any sense. Some, unable to bear the extended strain, sank upon\nthe ground and covered their faces with their hands. But the half-grown\nchildren, wan with privations and fever, ragged and barefoot, watched\nsteadily the horse and its rider, their round, gleaming eyes full of\nwonder and fear.\n\n“It is Thomas,” said the Senora.\n\nAs he came near, and the beat of the horse’s hoofs could be heard, a cry\nalmost inarticulate, not to be described, shrill and agonizing in its\nintensity, broke simultaneously from the anxious women. It was one\ncry from many hearts, all at the last point of endurance. Thomas Worth\nunderstood it. He flung his hat up, and answered with a joyful “Hurrah!”\n\nWhen he reached the camp, every face was wet with tears, and a crowd of\nfaces was instantly round him. All the agonies of war were on them. He\nraised himself in his stirrups and shouted out:\n\n“You may all go back to your homes! Santa Anna is completely overthrown!\nThe Mexican army is destroyed! There will be no more fighting, no more\nfears. The independence of Texas is won! No matter where you come from,\nYOU ARE ALL TEXANS NOW! Victory! Freedom! Peace! My dear friends, go\nback to your homes. Your husbands will join you at the San Jacinto.”\n\nThen he dismounted and sought his mother and sisters. With joyful\namazement he recognized the change in the Senora. “You look like\nyourself, dear mother,” he said. “Father sends you this kiss. He would\nhave brought it, but there are a few wounded men to look after; and\nalso I can ride quicker. Antonia, cheer up my dear!--and Isabel,\nlittle darling, you will not need to cry any more for your ribbons, and\nmantillas, and pretty dresses.”\n\n“Thomas! You have not much feeling, I think. What I want to know about,\nis Luis. You think of no one; and, as for my dresses, and mantillas, I\ndare say Fray Ignatius has sold, or burned them.”\n\n“Queridita! Was I cruel? Luis is well. He has not a scratch. He was in\nthe front of the battle, too.”\n\n“THAT, of course. Would you imagine that Luis would be at the rear? He\nis General Houston’s friend, and one lion knows another lion.”\n\n“Pretty one, do not be angry with me. I will tell you some good news.\nLuis is coming here, unless you go back at once with me.”\n\n“We will go back with you, Thomas. I am full of impatience. I remember\nmy dear home. I will go to it, like a bird to its nest.”\n\nIn half an hour they had turned the heads of their horses westward\nagain. They went so rapidly, and were under so much excitement, that\nsustained conversation was impossible. And the Senora also fell into a\nsound sleep as soon as the first homeward steps had been taken. Whatever\nhad been made known to her by Juan had received its fulfilment. She was\nassured and happy. She slept till they reached the victorious camp,\nand her husband awakened her with a kiss. She answered him with her\nold childish impulsiveness. And among the first words she said, were\n“Roberto, my beloved, I have seen Juan.”\n\nHe believed her. To his reverent soul there was nothing incredible in\nthe statement. The tie between a mother and her child is not broken by\ndeath. Was it unlikely, then, that Juan should have been conscious of,\nand touched by, the mental agony which his untimely death had caused a\nmother so beloved?\n\nAnd oh! how different was the return to the ground west of the Buffalo\nBayou. The very atmosphere was changed. A day or two of spring had\nbrought out the flowers and unfolded every green thing. Doctor Worth\ntook his family to a fine Mexican marquee, and among other comforts\nthe Senora found there the chocolate she had so long craved, and some\ncigaritos of most delicate flavor.\n\nIn a short time a luxurious meal was prepared by Antonia, and just as\nthey were sitting down to it, Luis and Lopez entered the tent together.\nIsabel had expected the visit and prepared for it as far as her limited\nwardrobe permitted. And her fine hair, and bright eyes, her perfect face\nand form, and the charming innocence of her manners, adorned her as the\ncolor and perfume of the rose make the beauty of the flower. She was so\nlovely that she could dare to banter Luis on the splendor of his attire.\n\n“It is evident, mi madre, that Luis has found at least the baggage of a\nmajor-general. Such velvet and silver embroidery! Such a silk sash! They\nare fit at the very least for a sultan of the Turks.”\n\nHe came to her crowned with victory. Like a hero he came, and like a\nlover. They had a thousand pretty things to say to each other; and a\nthousand blissful plans in prospect. Life to them had never before been\nso well worth living.\n\nIndeed, a wonderful exaltation possessed both Luis and Lopez. The\nsombre, handsome face of the latter was transfigured by it. He kissed\nthe hand of the Senora, and then turned to Antonia. Her pallor and\nemaciation shocked him. He could only murmur, “Senorita!” But she saw\nthe surprise, the sorrow, the sympathy, yes, the adoring love in his\nheart, and she was thankful to him for the reticence that relieved her\nfrom special attention.\n\nDoctor Worth made room for Lopez beside him. Luis sat by Isabel, upon a\npile of splendid military saddle-cloths. As she sipped her chocolate, he\nsmoked his cigarito in a lazy fashion, and gave himself up with delight\nto that foolishness of love-making which is often far wiser than the\nvery words of wisdom.\n\nAs yet the ladies had not spoken of the battle. It was won. That great\nfact had been as much as they could bear at first. The Senora wanted\nto sleep. Isabel wanted to see Luis. Only Antonia was anxious for the\ndetails, and she had been busy in preparing the respectable meal which\nher mother had so long craved. The apparent indifference was natural\nenough. The assurance of good fortune is always sufficient for the first\nstage of reaction from anxiety. When the most urgent personal feelings\nhave been satisfied, then comes the demand for detail and discussion. So\nnow, as they sat together, the Senora said:\n\n“No one has told me anything about the battle. Were you present,\nRoberto?”\n\n“I had that great honor, Maria. Lopez and Luis were with the cavalry,\nand Ortiz also has had some satisfaction for all his wrongs.”\n\n“Very good! But I am impatient for the story; so is Antonia; and as\nfor Isabel--bah! the little one is listening to another story. One must\nexcuse her. We expected the battle on the twentieth, but no!”\n\n“The enemy were expecting it also, and were in high spirits and perfect\npreparation. Houston thought it prudent to dash their enthusiasm by\nuncertainty and waiting. But at dawn, on the twenty-first, we heard the\nthree taps of the drum, and seven hundred soldiers sprang to their feet\nas one man. Houston had been watching all night. He spoke to us with a\ntongue of fire and then, while we cooked and ate our breakfast, he lay\ndown and slept. The sun came up without a cloud, and shone brightly on\nhis face. He sprang to his feet and said to Burleson, as he saluted him:\n‘The sun of Austerlitz has risen again.’\n\n“Some one brought him a piece of cornbread and broiled beef. He sat upon\nthe grass and ate it--or rather upon the blue hyacinths that covered the\ngrass; they are red now. For many weeks I had not seen his countenance\nso bright; all traces of trouble and anxiety were gone. He called Deaf\nSmith--the scout of scouts--and quickly ordered him to cut down the only\nbridge across the bayou.\n\n“At nine o’clock, General Cos joined Santa Anna with five hundred and\nforty men, and for a moment I thought we had made a mistake in not\nattacking the enemy before his reinforcements came up. But the knowledge\nthat Cos was present, raised enthusiasm to the highest pitch. Our troops\nremembered his parole at the Alamo, and the shameful manner in which he\nhad broken it; and there was not a man who did not long to kill him for\nit.\n\n“About three o’clock in the afternoon, Houston ordered the attack. The\nseven hundred Americans were divided into three bodies. I saw Houston in\nthe very centre of the line, and I have a confused memory of Milard and\nLamar, Burleson and Sherman and Wharton, in front of their divisions.”\n\n“Were the Mexicans expecting the attack, father?”\n\n“They were in perfect order, Antonia; and when Sherman shouted the\nbattle-cry: ‘REMEMBER THE ALAMO! GOLIAD AND THE ALAMO!’ it was taken up\nby the whole seven hundred, and such a shout of vengeance mortal ears\nnever heard before. The air was full of it, and it appeared to be echoed\nand repeated by innumerable voices.\n\n“With this shout on our lips, we advanced to within sixty paces of the\nMexican lines, and then a storm of bullets went flying over our heads.\nOne ball, however, shattered Houston’s ankle, and another struck his\nhorse in the breast. But both man and horse were of the finest metal,\nand they pressed on regardless of their wounds. We did not answer the\nvolley until we poured our lead into their very bosoms. No time for\nreloading then. We clubbed our rifles till they broke, flung them away\nand fired our pistols in the eyes of the enemy; then, nothing else\nremaining, took our bowie-knives from our belts and cut our way through\nthe walls of living flesh.”\n\nLopez rose at the words. It was impossible for him to express himself\nsufficiently in an attitude of repose. His eyes glowed like fire, his\ndark face was like a flame, he threw up his hands as he cried:\n\n“Nothing comparable to that charge with knives was ever made on earth!\nIf I had seen through the smoke and vapor the mighty shade of Bowie\nleading it, I should not have been surprised.”\n\n“Perhaps indeed, he did lead it,” said the Senora, in a solemn voice. “I\nsaw yes, by all the saints of God! I saw a great host with my Juan. They\nstretched out vast, shadowy arms--they made me FEEL what I can never\ntell. But I shall honor Senor Houston. I shall say to him some day.\n‘Senor, the unseen battalions--the mighty dead as well as the mighty\nliving--won the battle.’ Roberto, believe me, there are things women\nunderstand better than wise men.”\n\nA little awe, a solemn silence, answered the earnest woman. Luis and\nIsabel came close to her, and Isabel took her hand. Lopez resumed the\nconversation. “I know Colonel Bowie,” he said. “In the last days at\nSan Antonio I was often with him. Brave as a lion, true to his friends,\nrelentless to his foes, was he. The knife he made was the expression of\nhis character in steel. It is a knife of extreme unction--the oil and\nwafer are all that remains for the men who feels its edge. For my part,\nI honor the Senora’s thought. It is a great satisfaction to me to hope\nthat Bowie, and Crockett, and Travis, and Fannin, and all their company\nwere present at San Jacinto. If the just God permitted it, ‘twas a favor\nof supreme justice.”\n\n“But then you are not alone in the thought, Lopez. I heard General\nSherman say, ‘Poor Fannin! He has been blamed for not obeying Houston’s\norders. I THINK HE OBEYED THEM TO-DAY.’ At the moment I did not\ncomprehend; but now it is plain to me. He thought Fannin had been\npresent, and perhaps it was this belief made him so impetuous and\ninvincible. He fought like a spirit; one forgot that he was flesh and\nblood.”\n\n“Sherman is of a grand stock,” said the doctor; “descended from the\nwise Roger Sherman; bred in Massachusetts and trained in all the hardy\nvirtues of her sons. It was from his lips the battle-cry of ‘REMEMBER\nTHE ALAMO!’ sprang.”\n\n“But then, Roberto, nothing shall persuade me that my countrymen are\ncowards.”\n\n“On the contrary, Maria, they kept their ground with great courage.\nThey were slain by hundreds just where they stood when the battle began.\nTwenty-six officers and nearly seven hundred men were left dead upon the\nfield. But the flight was still more terrible. Into the bayou horses\nand men rolled down together. The deep black stream became red; it was\nchoked up with their dead bodies, while the mire and water of the morass\nwas literally bridged with the smothered mules and horses and soldiers.”\n\n“The battle began at three o’clock; but we heard the firing only for a\nvery short time,” said Antonia.\n\n“After we reached their breastworks it lasted just eighteen minutes. At\nfour, the whole Mexican army was dead, or flying in every direction,\nand the pursuit and slaughter continued until twilight. Truly an unseen\npower made all our moves for us. It was a military miracle, for our loss\nwas only eight killed and seventeen wounded.”\n\n“I am sorry Houston is among the wounded.”\n\n“His ankle-bone is shattered. He is suffering much. I was with him when\nhe left the field and I was delighted with his patience and dignity. The\nmen crowded around him. They seized his bridle; they clasped his hands.\n‘Have we done well to-day, General? Are you satisfied with us?’ they\ncried.\n\n“‘You have covered yourselves with glory,’ he answered. ‘You have\nwritten a grand page in American history this day, boys. For it was not\nfor fame nor for empire you fought; but for your rights as freemen, for\nyour homes and your faith.’\n\n“The next moment he fell from his horse and we laid him down at the foot\nof an oak tree. He had fainted from loss of blood and the agony of his\nwound, combined with the superhuman exertions and anxieties of the past\nweek.”\n\n“But he is better now?”\n\n“Yes; I dressed the wound as well as my appliances permitted; but he\nwill not be able to use his foot for some time. No one slept that night.\nWeary as the men were, their excitement and happiness were too great for\nthe bonds of sleep. In the morning the rich spoils of the enemy’s camp\nwere divided among them. Houston refused any part in them. ‘My share\nof the honor is sufficient,’ he said. Yet the spoils were very valuable\nones to men who but a few hours before had nothing but the clothing\nthey wore and the arms they carried. Among them were nearly one thousand\nstand of English muskets, three hundred valuable mules, one hundred\nfine horses, provisions, clothing, tents, and at least twelve thousand\ndollars in silver.”\n\n“Were you on the field all the time, father?”\n\n“I was near Houston from first to last. When he saw the battle was won,\nhe did his best to prevent needless slaughter. But men on a battle-field\nlike San Jacinto cannot be reasoned with; after a certain point, they\ncould not even be commanded. The majority had some private revenge to\nsatisfy after the public welfare had been served. We met one old man in\na frenzy, covered with blood from his white beard to his boots, his arms\nbare to his shoulders, his knife dripping from haft to point.”\n\n“Houston looked at him, and said something about mercy and valor.\n‘General,’ he said, ‘they killed two of my boys at Goliad, and my\nbrother at the Alamo. I’ll not spare a Mexican while I’ve the strength\nto kill one. I’m on the scent for Santa Anna, and, by G--, if I find\nhim, I will spare Texas and you any more trouble with the brute.’”\n\nAt this moment Thomas Worth entered the marquee, and, in an excited\nmanner, said:\n\n“Santa Anna is taken! Santa Anna is taken!”\n\n“Taken!” cried the Senora in a passion.\n\n“Taken! Is it possible the wretch is yet in this world? I was assuring\nmyself that he was in one not so comfortable. Why is he not killed? It\nis an inconceivable insult to humanity to let him live. Have you thought\nof your brother Juan? Give me the knife in your belt, Thomas, if you\ncannot use it.”\n\n“My dear mother--”\n\n“Maria, my life! Thomas could not wisely kill so important a prisoner.\nTexas wants him to secure her peace and independence. The lives of all\nthe Americans in Mexico may depend upon his. Mere personal vengeance on\nhim would be too dear a satisfaction. On the battle-field he might have\nbeen lawfully slain--and he was well looked for; but now, No.”\n\n“Holy Mary! might have been slain! He ought to have been slain, a\nthousand times over.”\n\n“Luis, I wish that you had been a hero, and killed him. Then all our\nlife long, if you had said, ‘Isabel, I slew Santa Anna,’ I should have\ngiven you honor for it. I should be obedient to your wishes for that\ndeed.”\n\n“But my charming one, I prefer to be obedient to your wish. Let us not\nthink of the creature; he is but a dead dog.”\n\nThe doctor turned to his son. “Thomas, tell us about the capture.”\n\n“I was riding with a young lieutenant, called Sylvester, from\nCincinnati, and he saw a man hiding in the grass. He was in coarsest\nclothing, but Sylvester noticed under it linen of fine cambric. He said:\n‘You are an officer, I perceive, sir.’ The man denied it, but when he\ncould not escape, he asked to be taken to General Houston. Sylvester\ntied him to his bridle-rein, and we soon learned the truth; for as we\npassed the Mexican prisoners they lifted their hats and said, with a\nmurmur of amazement, ‘El Presidente!’\n\n“The news spread like wildfire. As we took him through the camp he\ntrembled at the looks and words that assailed him, and prayed us\ncontinually, ‘for the love of God and the saints,’ not to let him be\nslain. We took him to Houston in safety. Houston was resting on the\nground, having had, as my father knows, a night of great suffering.\nSanta Anna approached him, and, laying his hand on his heart, said:\n‘I am General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, President of the Mexican\nRepublic, and I claim to be your prisoner of war.’ Houston pointed to a\nseat, and then sent for Santa Anna’s secretary, Almonte, who is also a\nprisoner, and who speaks English perfectly.’\n\n“When Almonte came, he embraced Santa Anna, and addressing Houston,\nsaid: ‘General, you are born to a great destiny. You have conquered the\nNapoleon of the West. Generosity becomes the brave and the fortunate.’\n\n“Houston answered, sternly: ‘You should have remembered that sentiment\nat the Alamo and at Goliad.’\n\n“Then the following conversation occurred. Santa Anna said:\n\n“‘The Alamo was taken by storm. The usages of war permitted the\nslaughter.’\n\n“‘We live in the nineteenth century, President. We profess to be\nChristians.’\n\n“‘I have to remind you, General Houston, of the storming of San\nSebastian, Ciudad, Riego and Badajos, by the Duke of Wellington.’\n\n“‘That was in Spain. There may have been circumstances demanding such\ncruelty.’\n\n“‘Permit me also to bring to your intelligence the battles at Fort Meigs\nand at the river Raisin. American prisoners were there given by English\nofficers to their Indian allies for torture and death. The English war\ncry at Sandusky was, “Give the d---- Yankees no quarter.”’\n\n“‘Sir, permit me to say, that you read history to a devilish purpose,\nif you read it to search after brutal precedents. At Goliad our men\nsurrendered. They were promised safe-conduct out of Texas. The massacre\nat Goliad was a ferocious crime.’\n\n“‘It was precisely the same thing as the wholesale murder of Turkish\nprisoners at Jaffa by the great Napoleon. Also I had the positive orders\nof my government to slay all Americans found with arms.’\n\n“‘These men had given up their arms.’\n\n“‘All Americans--my government said so.’\n\n“‘Sir! YOU are the government of Mexico. You obeyed your own orders.’\n\n“‘You will at least allow that, in the eyes of recognized nations, your\narmy was but a band of desperadoes, without government, and fighting\nunder no flag.’\n\n“‘Sir, you show a convenient ignorance. We have a government; and as\nsoon as we can lay down our rifles, we shall probably be able to make\na flag. I say to you, President Santa Anna, that the butchery at Goliad\nwas without an excuse and without a parallel in civilized warfare. The\nmen had capitulated to General Urrea.’\n\n“‘Urrea had no right to receive their capitulation.’ Then his mild,\nhandsome face became in a moment malicious and tigerish, and he said\nwith a cruel emphasis: ‘If I ever get Urrea into my hands, I will\nexecute him! I perceive, however, that I have never understood the\nAmerican character. For the few thousands in the country, I thought my\narmy an overwhelming one. I underestimated their ability.’\n\n“‘I tell you, sir, an army of millions would be too small to enslave ten\nthousand free-born anglo-Americans. Liberty is our birthright. We have\nmarched four days on an ear or two of dry corn, and then fought a battle\nafter it’; and Houston drew from his pocket an ear, partially consumed,\nwhich had been his ration. ‘We have had no tents, no music, no uniforms,\nno flag, nothing to stimulate us but the determination to submit to no\nwrong, and to have every one of our rights.’\n\n“Then he turned to Rusk and Sherman, and called a military counsel about\nthe prisoner, who was placed in an adjoining tent under a sufficient\nguard. But the excitement is intense; and the wretch is suffering,\nundoubtedly, all the mortal terrors of being torn to pieces by an\ninfuriated soldiery. Houston will have to speak to them. They will be\ninfluenced by no other man.”\n\nThe discussion upon this event lasted until midnight. But the ladies\nretired to their own tent much earlier. They knelt together in grateful\nprayer, and then kissed each other upon their knees. It was so sweet\nto lie down once more in safety; to have the luxury of a tent, and a\nmattress, and pillow.\n\n“Blessed be the hand of God! my children,” said the Senora; “and may the\nangels give us in our dreams grateful thoughts.”\n\nAnd then, in the dark, Isabel nestled her head in her sister’s breast,\nand whispered: “Forgive me for being happy, sweet Antonia. Indeed, when\nI smiled on Luis, I was often thinking of you. In my joy and triumph and\nlove, I do not forget that one great awful grave at Goliad. But a woman\nmust hide so many things; do you comprehend me, Antonia?”\n\n“Querdita,” she whispered, “I comprehend all. God has done right. If His\nangel had said to me, ‘One must be taken and the other left,’ I should\nhave prayed, ‘Spare then my little sister all sorrow.’ Good-night, my\ndarling”; but as their lips met, Isabel felt upon her cheeks the\nbitter rain which is the price of accepted sacrifice; the rain, which\nafterwards makes the heart soft, and fresh, and responsive to all the\nairs of God.\n\nAt the same moment, the white curtains of the marquee, in which the\ndoctor sat talking with his son and Luis and Lopez, were opened; and the\nface of Ortiz showed brown and glowing between them.\n\n“Senors,” he said, as he advanced to them, “I am satisfied. I have been\nappointed on the guard over Santa Anna. He has recognized me. He has to\nobey my orders. Will you think of that?” Then taking the doctor’s hand\nhe raised it to his lips. “Senor, I owe this satisfaction to you. You\nhave made me my triumph. How shall I repay you?”\n\n“By being merciful in the day of your power, Ortiz.”\n\n“I assure you that I am not so presumptuous, Senor. Mercy is the right\nof the Divinity. It is beyond my capacity. Besides which, it is not\nlikely the Divinity will trouble himself about Santa Anna. I have,\ntherefore, to obey the orders of the great, the illustrious Houston;\nwhich are, to prevent his escape at all risks. May St. James give me the\nopportunity, Senors! In this happy hour, a Dios!”\n\nThen Lopez bent forward, and with a smile touched the doctor’s hand.\n“Will you now remember the words I said of Houston? Did I not tell you,\nthat success was with him? that on his brow was the line of fortune?\nthat he was the loadstone in the breast of freedom?”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. HOME AGAIN.\n\n                        “Where’er we roam,\n         Our first, best country ever is at home.”\n\n         “What constitutes a state?\n              Men who their duties know;\n          But know their rights, and knowing, dare maintain.\n\n         “And sovereign law, that states collected will\n              O’er thrones and globes elate,\n          Sits empress; crowning good, repressing ill.\n\n         “This hand to tyrants ever sworn a foe,\n              For freedom only deals the deadly blow;\n          Then sheathes in calm repose the vengeful blade,\n              For gentle peace, in freedom’s hallowed shade.”\n\n\nThe vicinity of a great battle-field is a dreadful place after the lapse\nof a day or two. The bayou and the morass had provided sepulture\nfor hundreds of slain Mexicans, but hundreds still lay upon the open\nprairie. Over it, birds of prey hung in dark clouds, heavy-winged, sad,\nsombre, and silent. Nothing disturbed them. They took no heed of the\nliving. Armed with invincible talons and beaks tipped with iron,\nthey carried on ceaselessly that automatic gluttony, which made them\nbeneficent crucibles of living fire, for all which would otherwise have\ncorrupted the higher life. And yet, though innocent as the elements,\nthey were odious in the sight of all.\n\nBefore daylight in the morning the Senora and her daughters were ready\nto begin their homeward journey. The doctor could not accompany them,\nGeneral Houston and the wounded Americans being dependent largely\nupon his care and skill. But Luis Alveda and Lopez Navarro received an\nunlimited furlough; and about a dozen Mexican prisoners of war belonging\nto San Antonio were released on Navarro’s assurance, and permitted to\ntravel with the party as camp servants. It was likely, also, that they\nwould be joined by a great many of the families who had accompanied the\ngreat flight; for, on the preceding evening, Houston had addressed the\narmy, and told the householders and farmers to go home and plant their\ncorn.\n\nFull of happiness, the ladies prepared for their journey. A good army\nwagon, drawn by eight mules, and another wagon, containing two tents and\neverything necessary for a comfortable journey, was waiting for them.\nThe doctor bid them good-by with smiles and cheerful promises. They were\ngoing home. The war was over. Independence was won. They had the hope\nof permanent peace. The weather also was as the weather may be among the\nfields of Eden. The heavens were cloudless, the air sweet and fresh, and\nthe wild honeysuckles, with their spread hands full of scent, perfumed\nthe prairies mile after mile. The mules went knee-deep through warm\ngrasses; the grasses were like waving rainbows, with the myriads of\nbrightly tinted flowers.\n\nEven Lopez was radiantly happy. Most unusual smiles lighted up his\nhandsome face, and he jingled the silver ornaments on his bridle\npleasantly to his thoughts as he cantered sometimes a little in advance\nof the wagon, sometimes in the rear, occasionally by its side; then,\nbending forward to lift his hat to the ladies and inquire after their\ncomfort.\n\nLuis kept close to Isabel; and her lovely face and merry chatter\nbeguiled him from all other observations. A little before noon they\nhalted in a beautiful wood; a tent was spread for the ladies, the\nanimals were loosened from their harness, and a luxurious meal laid upon\nthe grass. Then the siesta was taken, and at three o’clock travel was\nresumed until near sunset, when the camp was made for the night. The\nsame order was followed every day, and the journey was in every sense an\neasy and delightful one. The rides, cheered by pleasant companionship,\nwere not fatiguing; the impromptu meals were keenly relished. And there\nwere many sweet opportunities for little strolls in the dim green woods,\nand for delightful conversations, as they sat under the stars, while the\ncamp-fire blazed among the picturesque groups of Mexicans playing monte\naround it.\n\nOn the third afternoon, the Senora and Isabel were taking a siesta, but\nAntonia could not sleep. After one or two efforts she was thoroughly\naroused by the sound of voices which had been very familiar to her in\nthe black days of the flight--those of a woman and her weary family of\nseven children. She had helped her in many ways, and she still felt an\ninterest in her welfare. It appeared now to be assured. Antonia found\nher camping in a little grove of mulberry trees. She had recovered her\nhealth; her children were noisy and happy, and her husband, a tall,\nathletic man, with a determined eye and very courteous manners, was\nunharnessing the mules from a fine Mexican wagon; part of the lawful\nspoils of war. They, too, were going home: “back to the Brazos,” said\nthe woman affectionately; “and we’re in a considerable hurry,” she added,\n“because it’s about time to get the corn in. Jake lays out to plant\nfifty acres this year. He says he can go to planting now with an easy\nconscience; he ‘lows he has killed enough Mexicans to keep him quiet a\nspell.”\n\nThey talked a short time together, and then Antonia walked slowly into\nthe deeper shadows of the wood. She found a wide rock, under trees\nsoftly dimpling, pendulous, and tenderly green; and she sat down in the\nsweet gloom, to think of the beloved dead. She had often longed for some\nquiet spot, where, alone with God and nature, she could, just for once,\ngive to her sorrow and her love a free expression.\n\nNow the opportunity seemed to be hers. She began to recall her whole\nacquaintance with Dare--their hours of pleasant study--their sails upon\nthe river--their intercourse by the fireside--the most happy Sundays,\nwhen they walked in the house of God together. In those days, what a\nblessed future was before them! She recalled also the time of hope and\nanxiety after the storming of the Alamo, and then the last heroic act\nof his stainless life. She had felt sure that in such a session with\nher own soul she would find the relief of unrestrained and unchecked\nweeping. But we cannot kindle when we will either the fire or the\nsensibility of the soul. She could not weep; tears were far from her.\nNay, more, she began to feel as if tears were not needed for one who\nhad found out so beautiful, so unselfish, so divine a road to the grave.\nOught she not rather to rejoice that he had been so early called and\nblest? To be glad for herself, too, that all her life long she could\nkeep the exquisite memory of a love so noble?\n\nIn the drift of such thoughts, her white, handsome face grew almost\nangelic. She sat motionless and let them come to her; as if she were\nlistening to the comforting angels. For God has many ways of saying\nto the troubled soul: “Be at peace”; and, certainly, Antonia had not\nanticipated the calmness and resignation which forbid her the tears she\nhad bespoken.\n\nAt length, in that sweet melancholy which such a mental condition\ninduces, she rose to return to the camp. A few yards nearer to it she\nsaw Lopez sitting in a reverie as profound as her own had been. He stood\nup to meet her. The patience, the pathos, the exaltation in her face\ntouched his heart as no words could have done. He said, only: “Senorita,\nif I knew how to comfort you!”\n\n“I went away to think of the dead, Senor.”\n\n“I comprehend--but then, I wonder if the dead remember the living!”\n\n“In whatever dwelling-place of eternity the dear ones who died at Goliad\nare, I am sure that they remember. Will the emancipated soul be less\nfaithful than the souls still earthbound? Good souls could not even wish\nto forget--and they were good.”\n\n“It will never be permitted me to know two souls more pure, more\nfaithful, more brave, Juan was as a brother to me, and, BY MY\nSANTIGUADA![6] I count it among God’s blessings to have known a man like\nSenor Grant. A white soul he had indeed; full of great nobilities!”\n\nAntonia looked at him gratefully. Tears uncalled-for sprang into the\neyes of both; they clasped hands and walked mutely back to the camp\ntogether. For the sentiment which attends the realization that all is\nover, is gathered silently into the heart; it is too deep for words.\n\nThey found the camp already in that flurry of excitement always\nattendant upon its rest and rising, and the Senora was impatiently\ninquiring for her eldest daughter.\n\n“GRACIOUS MARIA! Is that you, Antonia? At this hour we are all your\nservants, I think. I, at least, have been waiting upon your pleasure”;\nthen perceiving the traces of sorrow and emotion on her face, she added,\nwith an unreasonable querulousness: “I bless God when I see how He\nhas provided for women; giving them tears, when they have no other\nemployment for their time.”\n\n“Dearest mother, I am sorry to have kept you waiting. I hope that you\nhave forgotten nothing. Where is your mantilla? And have you replenished\nyour cigarito case? Is there water in the wagon?”\n\n“Nothing has been provided. Things most necessary are forgotten, no\ndoubt. When you neglect such matters, what less could happen?”\n\nBut such little breezes of temper were soon over. The influences\nsurrounding, the prospects in advance, were too exhilarating to permit\nof anything but passing shadows, and after an easy, delightful journey,\nthey reached at length the charming vicinity of the romantic city of\nthe sword. They had but another five miles ride, and it was the Senora’s\npleasure to take it at the hour of midnight. She did not wish her return\nto be observed and talked about; she was in reality very much mortified\nby the condition of her own and her daughters’ wardrobe.\n\nConsequently, though they made their noon camp so near to their\njourney’s end, they rested there until San Antonio was asleep and\ndreaming. It was the happiest rest of all the delightful ones they\nhad known. The knowledge that it was the last stage of a journey so\nremarkable, made every one attach a certain tender value to the hours\nnever to come back to the experiences never to be repeated.\n\nThe Senora was gay as a child; Isabel shared and accentuated her\nenthusiasms; Luis was expressing his happiness in a variety of songs;\nnow glorifying his love in some pretty romance or serenade, again\nmusically assuring liberty, or Texas, that he would be delighted at any\nmoment to lay down his life for their sakes. Antonia was quite as much\nexcited in her own way, which was naturally a much quieter way; and\nLopez sat under a great pecan-tree, smoking his cigarito with placid\nsmiles and admiring glances at every one.\n\nAs the sun set, the full moon rose as it rises nowhere but over Texan or\nAsian plains; golden, glorious, seeming to fill the whole heaven and the\nwhole earth with an unspeakable radiance; softly glowing, exquisitely,\nmagically beautifying. The commonest thing under it was transfigured\ninto something lovely, fantastic, fairylike. And the dullest souls\nswelled and rose like the tides under its influence.\n\nAntonia took from their stores the best they had, and a luxurious supper\nwas spread upon the grass. The meal might have been one of ten courses,\nit occupied so long; it provoked so much mirth, such a rippling stream\nof reminiscence; finally, such a sweetly solemn retrospect of the\nsorrows and mercies and triumphs of the campaign they had shared\ntogether. This latter feeling soon dominated all others.\n\nThe delicious light, the sensuous atmosphere, the white turrets and\ntowers of the city, shining on the horizon like some mystical, heavenly\ncity in dreams--the murmur of its far-off life, more audible to the\nspiritual than the natural ears--the dark figures of the camp servants,\nlying in groups or quietly shuffling their cards, were all elements\nconducive to a grave yet happy seriousness.\n\nNo one intended to sleep. They were to rest in the moonlight until\nthe hour of eleven, and then make their last stage. This night they\ninstinctively kept close together. The Senora had mentally reached that\npoint where it was not unpleasant to talk over troubles, and to amplify\nespecially her own share of them.\n\n“But, Holy Maria!” she said; “how unnecessary are such sorrows! I\nam never, in the least, any better for them. When the Divine Majesty\ncondescends to give me the sunshine of prosperity, I am always\nexceedingly religious. On the contrary when I am in sorrow, I do not\nfeel inclined to pray. That is precisely natural. Can the blessed Mother\nexpect thanks, when she gives her children only suffering and tears?”\n\n“God gives us whatever is best for us, dear mother.”\n\n“Speak, when you have learned wisdom, Antonia. I shall always believe\nthat trouble comes from the devil; indeed, Fray Ignatius once told me\nof a holy man that had one grief upon the heels of the other, and it was\nthe devil who was sent with all of them. I have myself no doubt that\nhe opened the gates of hell for Santa Anna to return to earth and do a\nlittle work for him.”\n\n“This thought makes me tremble,” said Lopez; “souls that have become\nangelic, can become evil. The degraded seraphim, whom we call the\ndevil, was once the companion of archangels, and stood with Michael, and\nRaphael, and Gabriel, in the presence of the Holy One. Is there sin in\nheaven? Can we be tempted even there?”\n\nThe inquiry went in different ways to each heart, but no one answered\nit. There were even a few moments of constrained, conscious silence,\nwhich Luis happily ended, by chanting softly a verse from the hymn of\nthe Three Angels:\n\n         “‘WHO LIKE THE LORD?’ thunders Michael the Chief.\n           Raphael, ‘THE CURE OF GOD,’ bringeth relief,\n           And, as at Nazareth, prophet of peace,\n           Gabriel, ‘THE LIGHT OF GOD,’ bringeth release.”\n\n\nThe noble syllables floated outward and upward, and Antonia and Lopez\nsoftly intoned the last line together, letting them fall slowly and\nsoftly into the sensitive atmosphere.\n\n“And as for trouble coming from the devil,” said Lopez, “I think,\nSenora, that Fray Ignatius is wrong. Trouble is not the worst thing that\ncan come to a man or woman. On the contrary, our Lady of Prosperity is\nsaid to do, them far greater harm. Let me repeat to you what the ever\nwise Don Francisco de Quevedo Villegas says about her:\n\n“‘Where is the virtue prosperity has not staggered? Where the folly she\nhas not augmented? She takes no counsel, she fears no punishment. She\nfurnishes matter for scandal, experience, and for story. How many souls,\ninnocent while poor, have fallen into sin and impiety as soon as they\ndrank of the enchanted cup of prosperity? Men that can bear prosperity,\nare for heaven; even wise devils leave them alone. As for the one who\npersecuted and beggared job, how foolish and impertinent he was! If\nhe had understood humanity, he would have multiplied his riches, and\npossessed him of health, and honors, and pleasures: THAT is the trial it\ncannot bear.’”\n\n“Oh, to be sure! Quevedo was a wise man. But even wise men don’t know\neverything. However, WE ARE GOING HOME! I thank the saints for this\nimmeasurable favor. It is a prosperity that is good for women. I will\nstake my Santiguida on that! And will you observe that it is Sunday\nagain? Just before sunset I heard the vesper bells clearly. Remember\nthat we left San Antonio on Sunday also! I have always heard that Sunday\nwas a good day to begin a journey on.”\n\n“If it had been on a Friday--”\n\n“Friday! Indeed, Luis, I would not have gone one hundred yards upon a\nFriday. How can you suppose what is so inconceivably foolish?”\n\n“I think much of the right hour to undertake anything,” said Lopez. “The\nfirst movements are not in the hands of men; and we are subject to more\ninfluences than we comprehend. There is a ripe time for events, as well\nas for fruits: but the hour depends upon forces which we cannot control\nby giving to them the name of the day; and our sage Quevedo has made a\npleasant mockery thereon. It is at my lips, if your ears care to hear\nit.”\n\n“Quevedo, again! No, it is not proper, Senor. Every day has its duties\nand its favors, Senor. That man actually said that fasting on Friday was\nnot a special means of grace! Quevedo was almost a heretic. I have heard\nFray Ignatius say so. He did not approve of him.”\n\n“Mi madre, let us hear what is to be said. Rachela told me, I must fast\non a Friday, and cut my nails on a Wednesday, and never cut them on a\nSunday, and take medicine on a Monday, and look after money on Tuesday,\nand pay calls and give gifts on Saturday; very well, I do not think much\nof Rachela; just suppose, for the passing of the time, that we listen to\nwhat Quevedo says.”\n\n“Here are four against me; well, then, proceed, Senor.”\n\n“‘On Monday,’ says the wise and witty one, buy all that you can meet\nwith, and take all that is to be had for nothing. On Tuesday, receive\nall that is given you; for it is Mar’s day, and he will look on you with\nan ill aspect if you refuse the first proffer and have not a second. On\nWednesday, ask of all you meet; perhaps Mercury may give some one vanity\nenough to grant you something. Thursday is a good day to believe nothing\nthat flatterers say. Friday it is well to shun creditors. On Saturday\nit is well to lie long abed, to walk at your ease, to eat a good dinner,\nand to wear comfortable shoes; because Saturn is old, and loves his\nease.’”\n\n“And Sunday, Senor?”\n\n“Pardon, Senorita Isabel, Sunday comes not into a pasquinade. Senora,\nlet me tell you that it draws near to eleven. If we leave now we shall\nreach San Antonio in time to say the prayer of gratitude before the\nblessed day of the seven is past.”\n\n“Holy Mary! that is what I should desire. Come, my children; I thank\nyou, Senor, for such a blessed memory. My heart is indeed full of joy\nand thankfulness.”\n\nA slight disappointment, however, awaited the Senora. Without asking any\nquestions, without taking anything into consideration, perhaps, indeed,\nbecause she feared to ask or consider, she had assumed that she would\nimmediately re-enter her own home. With the unreason of a child, she had\ninsisted upon expecting that somehow, or by some not explained efforts,\nshe would find her house precisely as she left it. Little had been said\nof its occupancy by Fray Ignatius and his brothers; perhaps she did not\nquite believe in the statement; perhaps she expected Fray Ignatius to\nrespect the arrangements which he knew had been so dear to her.\n\nIt was therefore a trial--indeed, something of a shock--when she found\nthey were to be the guests of Navarro, and when it was made clear to her\nthat her own home had been dismantled and rearranged and was still in\nthe possession of the Church. But, with a child’s unreason, she had also\na sweet ductility of nature; she was easily persuaded, easily pleased,\nand quite ready to console herself with the assurance that it only\nneeded Doctor Worth’s presence and personal influence to drive away all\nintruders upon her rights.\n\nIn the mean time she was contented. The finest goods in San Antonio were\nsent early on the following morning to her room; and the selection of\nthree entire wardrobes gave her abundance of delightful employment. She\nalmost wept with joy as she passed the fine lawns and rich silks through\nher worn fingers. And when she could cast off forever her garment of\nheaviness and of weariful wanderings, and array herself in the splendid\nrobes which she wore with such grace and pleasure, she was an honestly\ngrateful woman.\n\nThen she permitted Lopez to let her old acquaintances know of her\npresence in her native city; and she was comforted when she began to\nreceive calls from the Senora Alveda, and judge and Senora Valdez, and\nmany other of her friends and associates. They encouraged her to talk of\nher sufferings and her great loss. Even the judge thought it worth his\nwhile, now, to conciliate the simple little woman. He had wisdom enough\nto perceive that Mexican domination was over, and that the American\ninfluence of Doctor Worth was likely to be of service to him.\n\nThe Senora found herself a heroine; more than that, she became aware\nthat for some reason those who had once patronized her were now disposed\nto pay her a kind of court. But this did not lessen her satisfaction;\nshe suspected no motive but real kindness, for she had that innate\nrectitude which has always confidence in the honesty of others.\n\nThere was now full reconciliation between Luis and his mother and\nuncles; and his betrothal to Isabel was acknowledged with all the\ncustomary rejoicings and complimentary calls and receptions. Life\nquickly began to fall back into its well-defined grooves; if there was\nanything unusual, every one made an effort to pass it by without notice.\nThe city was conspicuously in this mind. American rule was accepted in\nthe quiescent temper with which men and women accept weather which may\nor may not be agreeable, but which is known to be unavoidable. Americans\nwere coming by hundreds and by thousands: and those Mexicans who could\nnot make up their minds to become Texans, and to assimilate with the new\nelements sure to predominate, were quietly breaking up their homes and\ntransferring their interests across the Rio Grande.\n\nThey were not missed, even for a day. Some American was ready to step\ninto their place, and the pushing, progressive spirit of the race was\nsoon evident in the hearty way with which they set to work, not only to\nrepair what war had destroyed, but to inaugurate those movements\nwhich are always among their first necessities. Ministers, physicians,\nteachers, mechanics of all kinds, were soon at work; churches\nwere built, Bibles were publicly sold, or given away; schools were\nadvertised; the city was changing its tone as easily as a woman changes\nthe fashion of her dress. Santa Anna had said truly enough to Houston,\nthat the Texans had no flag to fight under; but the young Republic very\nsoon flung her ensign out among those of the gray nations of the world.\nIt floated above the twice glorious Alamo: a bright blue standard, with\none white star in the centre. It was run up at sunrise one morning. The\ncity was watching for it; and when it suddenly flew out in their sight,\nit was greeted with the most triumphant enthusiasm. The lonely star in\nits field of blue touched every heart’s chivalry. It said to them, “I\nstand alone! I have no sister states to encourage and help me! I rely\nonly on the brave hearts and strong arms that I set me here!” And they\nanswered the silent appeal with a cheer that promised everything; with a\nlove that even then began to wonder if there were not a place for such\na glorious star in the grand constellation under which most of them had\nbeen born.\n\nA short time after their return, the Senora had a letter from her\nhusband, saying that he was going to New Orleans with General Houston,\nwhose wound was in a dangerous condition. Thomas Worth had been\nappointed to an important post in the civil government; and his labors,\nlike those of all the public men of Texas at that date, were continuous\nand Herculean. It was impossible for him to leave them; but the doctor\nassured his wife that he would return as soon as he had placed Houston\nin the hands of skilful surgeons; and he asked her, until then, to be as\nhappy as her circumstances permitted.\n\nShe was quite willing to obey the request. Not naturally inclined to\nworry, she found many sources of content and pleasure, until the early\ndays of June brought back to her the husband she so truly loved,\nand with him the promise of a return to her own home. Indeed the\ndifficulties in the way of this return had vanished ere they were to\nmeet. Fray Ignatius had convinced himself that his short lease had fully\nexpired; and when Dr. Worth went armed with the legal process necessary\nto resume his rights, he found his enemy had already surrendered them.\nThe house was empty. Nothing of its old splendor remained. Every one of\nits properties had been scattered. The poor Senora walked through the\ndesolate rooms with a heartache.\n\n“It was precisely in this spot that the sideboard stood, Roberto!--the\nsideboard that my cousin Johar presented to me.   It came from the City\nof Mexico, and there was not another like it. I shall regret it all my\nlife.”\n\n“Maria, my dearest, it might have been worse. The silver which adorned\nit is safe. Those r--monks did not find out its hiding-place, and I\nbought you a far more beautiful sideboard in New Orleans; the very\nnewest style, Maria.”\n\n“Roberto! Roberto! How happy you make me! To be sure my cousin Johar’s\nsideboard was already shabby--and to have a sideboard from New Orleans,\nthat, indeed, is something to talk about!”\n\n“Besides, which, dearest one, I bought new furniture for the parlors,\nand for your own apartments; also for Antonia’s and Isabel’s rooms.\nIndeed, Maria, I thought it best to provide afresh for the whole house.”\n\n“How wonderful! No wife in San Antonio has a husband so good. I\nwill never condescend to speak of you when other women talk of their\nhusbands. New furniture for my whole house! The thing is inconceivably\ncharming. But when, Roberto, will these things arrive? Is there danger\non the road they are coming? Might not some one take them away? I shall\nnot be able to sleep until I am sure they are safe.”\n\n“I chartered a schooner in New Orleans, and came with them to the Bay of\nEspiritu Santo. There I saw them placed upon wagons, and only left them\nafter the customs had been paid in the interior--sixty miles away. You\nmay hire servants at once to prepare the rooms: the furniture will be\nhere in about three days.”\n\n“I am the happiest woman in the world, Roberto!” And she really felt\nherself to be so. Thoughtful love could have devised nothing more likely\nto bridge pleasantly and surely over the transition between the past\nand the coming life. Every fresh piece of furniture unpacked was a new\nwonder and a new delight. With her satin skirts tucked daintily clear of\nsoil, and her mantilla wrapped around her head and shoulders, she went\nfrom room to room, interesting herself in every strip of carpet, and\nevery yard of drapery. Her delight was infectious. The doctor smiled to\nfind himself comparing shades, and gravely considering the arrangement\nof chairs and tables.\n\nBut how was it possible for so loving a husband and father to avoid\nsharing the pleasure he had provided? And Isabel was even more excited\nthan her mother. All this grandeur had a double meaning to her; it would\nreflect honor upon the betrothal receptions which would be given for\nLuis and herself--“amber satin and white lace is exactly what I should\nhave desired, Antonia,” she said delightedly. “How exceedingly suitable\nit will be to me! And those delicious chintzes and dimities for our\nbedrooms! Did you ever conceive of things so beautiful?”\n\nAntonia was quite ready to echo her delight. Housekeeping and\nhomemaking, in all its ways, was her lovable talent. It was really\nAntonia who saw all the plans and the desires of the Senora thoroughly\ncarried out. It was her clever fingers and natural taste which gave\nto every room that air of comfort and refinement which all felt and\nadmired, but which seemed to elude their power to imitate.\n\nOn the fourth of July the doctor and his family ate together their first\ndinner in their renovated home. The day was one that he never forgot,\nand he was glad to link it with a domestic occurrence so happy and so\nfortunate.\n\nSometimes silently, sometimes with a few words to his boys, he had\nalways, on this festival, drank his glass of fine Xeres to the honor\nand glory of the land he loved. This day he spoke her name proudly. He\nrecalled the wonders of her past progress; he anticipated the blessings\nwhich she would bring to Texas; he said, as he lifted the glass in his\nhand, and let the happy tears flow down his browned and thinned face:\n\n“My wife and daughters, I believe I shall live to see the lone star set\nin the glorious assemblage of her sister stars! I shall live to say, I\ndwell in San Antonio, which is the loveliest city in the loveliest State\nof the American Union. For, dear ones, I was born an American citizen,\nand I ask this favor of God, that I may also die an American citizen.”\n\n“MI ROBERTO, when you die I shall not long survive you. And now that\nthe house is made so beautiful! With so much new furniture! How can you\nspeak of dying?”\n\n“And, my dear father, remember how you have toiled and suffered for THE\nINDEPENDENCE OF TEXAS.”\n\n“Because, Antonia, I would have Texas go free into a union of free\nStates. This was the hope of Houston. ‘We can have help,’ he often said\nto his little army; ‘a word will call help from Nacogdoches,--but we\nwill emancipate ourselves. If we go into the American States, we will go\nas equals; we will go as men who have won the right to say: LET US DWELL\nUNDER THE SAME FLAG, FOR WE ARE BROTHERS!’”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. UNDER ONE FLAG.\n\n         “And through thee I believe\n          In the noble and great, who are gone.”\n\n         “Yes!  I believe that there lived\n          Others like thee in the past.\n          Not like the men of the crowd.\n          Who all around me to-day,\n          Bluster, or cringe, and make life\n          Hideous, and arid, and vile,\n          But souls temper’d with fire,\n          Fervent, heroic, and good;\n          Helpers, and friends of mankind.”\n                                   --ARNOLD.\n\n         “Our armor now may rust, our idle scimitars\n          Hang by our sides for ornament, not use.\n          Children shall beat our atabals and drums;\n          And all the noisy trades of war no more\n          Shall wake the peaceful morn.”\n                                   --DRYDEN.\n\nAs the years go on they bring many changes--changes that come as\nnaturally as the seasons--that tend as naturally to anticipated\ngrowth and decay--that scarcely startle the subjects of them, till\na lengthened-out period of time discloses their vitality and extent.\nBetween the ages of twenty and thirty, ten years do not seem very\ndestructive to life. The woman at eighteen, and twenty-eight, if\nchanged, is usually ripened and improved; the man at thirty, finer and\nmore mature than he was at twenty. But when this same period is placed\nto women and men who are either approaching fifty, or have passed it,\nthe change is distinctly felt.\n\nIt was even confessed by the Senora one exquisite morning in the\nbeginning of March, though the sun was shining warmly, and the flowers\nblooming, and the birds singing, and all nature rejoicing, as though it\nwas the first season of creation.\n\n“I am far from being as gay and strong as I wish to be, Roberto,”\n she, said; “and today, consider what a company there is coming! And if\nGeneral Houston is to be added to it, I shall be as weary as I shall be\nhappy.”\n\n“He is the simplest of men; a cup of coffee, a bit of steak--”\n\n“SAN BLAS! That is how you talk! But is, it possible to receive him like\na common mortal? He is a hero, and, besides that, among hidalgos de casa\nSolar” (gentlemen of known property)--\n\n“Well, then, you have servants, Maria, my dear one.”\n\n“Servants! Bah! Of what use are they, Roberto, since they also have got\nhold of American ideas?”\n\n“Isabel and Antonia will be here.”\n\n“Let me only enumerate to you, Roberto. Thomas and his wife and four\nchildren arrived last night. You may at this moment hear the little\nMaria crying. I dare say Pepita is washing the child, and using soap\nwhich is very disagreeable. I have always admired the wife of Thomas,\nbut I think she is too fond of her own way with the children. I give her\nadvices which she does not take.”\n\n“They are her own children, dearest.”\n\n“Holy Maria! They are also my own grandchildren.”\n\n“Well, well, we must remember that Abbie is a little Puritan. She\nbelieves in bringing up children strictly, and it is good; for Thomas\nwould spoil them. As for Isabel’s boys--”\n\n“God be blessed! Isabel’s boys are entirely charming. They have been\ncorrected at my own knee. There are not more beautifully behaved boys in\nthe christened world.”\n\n“And Antonia’s little Christina?”\n\n“She is already an angel. Ah, Roberto! If I had only died when I was as\ninnocent as that dear one!”\n\n“I am thankful you did not die, Maria. How dark my life would have been\nwithout you!”\n\n“Beloved, then I am glad I am not in the kingdom of heaven; though, if\none dies like Christina, one escapes purgatory. Roberto, when I rise I\nam very stiff: I think, indeed, I have some rheumatism.”\n\n“That is not unlikely; and also Maria, you have now some years.”\n\n“Let that be confessed; but the good God knows that I lost all my youth\nin that awful flight of ‘thirty-six.”\n\n“Maria, we all left or lost something on that dark journey. To-day, we\nshall recover its full value.”\n\n“To be sure--that is what is said--we shall see. Will you now send\nDolores to me? I must arrange my toilet with some haste; and tell me,\nRoberto, what dress is your preference; it is your eyes, beloved, I wish\nto please.”\n\nRobert Worth was not too old to feel charmed and touched by the\ncompliment. And he was not a thoughtless or churlish husband; he knew\nhow to repay such a wifely compliment, and it was a pleasant sight to\nsee the aged companions standing hand in hand before the handsome suits\nwhich Dolores had spread out for her mistress to examine.\n\nHe looked at the purple and the black and the white robes, and then\nhe looked at the face beside him. It was faded, and had lost its oval\nshape; but its coloring was yet beautiful, and the large, dark eyes\ntender and bright below the snow-white hair. After a few minutes’\nconsideration, he touched, gently, a robe of white satin. “Put this on,\nMaria,” he said, “and your white mantilla, and your best jewels. The\noccasion will excuse the utmost splendor.”\n\nThe choice delighted her. She had really wished to wear it, and\nsome one’s judgment to endorse her own inclinations was all that was\nnecessary to confirm her wish. Dolores found her in the most delightful\ntemper. She sat before the glass, smiling and talking, while her maid\npiled high the snowy plaits and curls and crowned them with the jewelled\ncomb, only worn on very great festivals. Her form was still good, and\nthe white satin fell gracefully from her throat to her small feet.\nBesides, whatever of loss or gain had marred her once fine proportions,\nwas entirely concealed by the beautifying, graceful, veiling folds of\nher mantilla. There was the flash of diamonds, and the moonlight glimmer\nof pearls beneath this flimsy covering; and at her belt a few white\nlilies. She was exceedingly pleased with her own appearance, and her\nsatisfaction gave an ease and a sense of authority to her air and\nmovements which was charming.\n\n“By Maria’s grace, I am a very pretty old lady,” she said to herself;\n“and I think I shall I astonish my daughter-in-law a little. One is\nafraid of these calm, cool, northern women, but I feel to-day that even\nAbbie must be proud of me.”\n\nIndeed, her entrance into the large parlor made quite a sensation. She\ncould see the quiet pleasure in her husband’s face; and her son Thomas,\nafter one glance, put down the child on his knee, and went to meet her.\n“Mi madre,” he whispered with a kiss. He had not used the pretty Spanish\nword for years, but in the sudden rush of admiring tenderness, his\nboyish heart came back to him, and quite unconsciously he used his\nboyhood’s speech. After this, she was not the least in awe of her wise\ndaughter-in-law. She touched her cheek kindly, and asked her about the\nchildren, and was immeasurably delighted when Abbie said: “How beautiful\nyou are to-day! I wish I had your likeness to send to Boston. Robert,\ncome here and look at your grandmother! I want you to remember, as long\nas you live, how grandmother looks to-day.” And Robert--a fine lad eight\nyears old, accustomed to implicit obedience--put down the book he was\nreading, planted himself squarely before the Senora, and looked at her\nattentively, as if she was a lesson to be learned.\n\n“Well then, Roberto?”\n\n“I am glad I have such a pretty grandmother. Will you let me stand on\ntiptoes and kiss you?” and the cool, calm northern woman’s eyes filled\nwith tears, as she brought her younger children, one by one, for the\nSenora’s caress. The doctor and his son watched this pretty domestic\ndrama with hearts full of pride and happiness; and before it had lost\none particle of its beauty and feeling, the door was flung open with\na vigor which made every one turn to it with expectation. A splendid\nlittle lad sprang in, and without any consideration for satin and lace,\nclung to the Senora. He was her image: a true Yturbide, young as he was;\nbeautiful and haughty as his Castilian ancestors.\n\nIsabel and Luis followed; Isabel more lovely than ever, richly dressed\nin American fashion, full of pretty enthusiasms, vivacious, charming,\nand quite at her ease. She had been married eight years. She was a\nfashionable woman, and an authority upon all social subjects.\n\nLuis also was wonderfully improved. The light-hearted gaiety, which ten\nyears ago had bubbled over in continual song, was still there; but it\nwas under control, evident only because it made perpetual sunshine\non his face. He had taken the doctor’s advice--completed his study\nof English and Mexican law--and become a famous referee in cases of\ndisputed Mexican claims and title deeds. His elegant form and handsome,\nolive face looked less picturesque in the dull, uncompromising stiffness\nof broadcloth, cut into those peculiarly unbecoming fashions of ugliness\nwhich the anglo-Saxon and anglo-American affect. But it gained by the\nchange a certain air of reliability and importance; an air not to be\ndispensed with in a young lawyer already aspiring to the seat among the\nlawmakers of his State.\n\n“We called upon Antonia,” said Isabel, “as we came here. Of course she\nwas engaged with Lopez. They were reading a book together; and even on\nsuch a day as this were taking, with the most blessed indifference, a\nminute at a time. They will join us on the Plaza. I represented to them\nthat they might miss a good position. ‘That has been already secured,’\nsaid Lopez, with that exasperating repose which only the saints could\nendure with patience. For that reason, I consider Antonia a saint to\npermit it. As for me, I should say: ‘The house is on fire, Lopez! Will\nit please you for once to feel a little excited?’ Luis says they read,\ncontinually, books which make people think of great solemnities and\nresponsibilities. How foolish, when they are so rich, and might enjoy\nthemselves perpetually!”\n\n“Here are the carriages,” cried Thomas Worth, “and the ceremony of\nto-day has its own hour. It will never come again.”\n\n“Your mother and I will go first, Thomas; and we will take Abbie and\nyour eldest son. I shall see you in your place. Luis, bring your boy\nwith you; he has intelligence and will remember the man he will see\nto-day, and may never see again.”\n\nOn the Plaza, close to the gates of the Alamo, a rostrum had been\nerected; and around it were a few stands, set apart for the carriages\nof the most illustrious of the families of San Antonio. The Senora, from\nthe shaded depths of her own, watched their arrival. Nothing could be\nmore characteristic than the approach of her daughters. Antonia and\nLopez, stately and handsome, came slowly; their high-stepping horses\nchafing at the restraint. Luis and Isabel drove to their appointed\nplace with a speed and clatter, accentuated by the jingling of the\nsilver rings of the harness and the silver hanging buttons on the\ngay dress of the Mexican driver. But the occupants of both carriages\nappeared to be great favorites with the populace who thronged the Plaza,\nthe windows, the flat roofs of the houses, and every available place for\nhearing and seeing.\n\nThe blue flag of Texas fluttered gayly over the lovely city; and there\nwas a salvo of cannon; then, into the sunshine and into the sight of all\nstepped the man of his generation. Nature has her royal line, and she\nmakes no mistakes in the kings she crowns. The physical charm of Houston\nwas at this time very great. His tall, ample, dignified form attracted\nattention at once. His eyes penetrated the souls of all upon whom they\nfell. His lips were touched with fire, and his words thrilled and swayed\nmen, as the wind sways the heavy heads in a field of ripe barley.\n\nHe stretched out his arms to the people, and they stretched out their\narms to him. The magnetic chain of sympathy was complete. The hearts of\nhis listeners were an instrument, on which he played the noblest, most\ninspiring, the sweetest of melodies. He kindled them as flame kindles\ndry grass. He showed them their future with a prophet’s eye, and touched\nthem also with the glad diviner’s rapture. They aspired, they rejoiced\nat his bidding; and at the moment of their highest enthusiasm, he cried\nout:\n\n“Whatever State gave us birth, we have one native land and we have one\nflag!” Instantly from the grim, blood-stained walls of the fortress, the\nblessed Stars and Stripes flew out; and in a moment a thousand smaller\nflags, from every high place, gave it salutation. Then the thunder of\ncannon was answered by the thunder of voices. Cannon may thunder and\nmake no impression; but the shout of humanity! It stirs and troubles the\ndeepest heart-stream. It is a cry that cannot be resisted. It sets the\ngates of feeling wide open. And it was while men were in this mood that\nHouston said his last words:\n\n“I look in this glorious sunshine upon the bloody walls of the Alamo. I\nremember Goliad. I carry my memory back over the long struggle of thirty\nyears. Do you think the young, brave souls, fired with the love of\nliberty, who fell in this long conflict have forgotten it? No! No!\nNo! Wherever in God’s Eternity they are this day, I believe they are\npermitted to know that Texas has become part of their country, and rests\nforever under the flag they loved. The shouting thousands, the booming\ncannon, that greeted this flag were not all the sounds I heard! Far\noff, far off, yet louder than any noise of earth, I heard from the dead\nyears, and the dead heroes of these years; the hurrahing of ghostly\nvoices and the clapping of unseen hands!”\n\n“It was like Houston to call the dead to the triumph,” said the doctor,\nas he stood with the Senora in her room. He was unbuttoning her gloves,\nand her tears dropped down upon his hands.\n\n“He is a man by himself, and none like him. I thought that I should\nnever forgive him for sparing the life of that monster--Santa Anna;\nbut to-day I forgive him even that. I am so happy that I shall ask Holy\nMaria to excuse me the feeling; for it is not good to permit one’s self\nto be too happy; it brings trouble. But indeed, when I looked at Thomas,\nI thought how wisely he has married. It is seldom a mother can approve\nof her daughter-in-law; but Abbie has many excellencies--good manners,\nand a good heart, and a fortune which is quite respectable.”\n\n“And strong principles also, Maria. She will bring up her children to\nknow right and wrong, and to do right.”\n\n“THAT of course. Every good mother does that. I am sure it is a sight\nfor the angels to see Isabel teaching her children their prayers. Did\nyou observe also how great a favorite Luis is? He lifted his hat to this\none and that one, and it is certain that the next election will be in\nhis hand.”\n\n“Perhaps--I wish Lopez would take more interest in politics. He is a\ndreamer.”\n\n“But, then, a very happy dreamer. Perhaps to dream well and pleasantly\nis to live a better life. Antonia is devoted to him. She has a blessed\nlot. Once I did not think she would be so fortunate.”\n\n“Lopez was prudent and patient.”\n\n“Prudent! Patient! It is a miracle to me! I assure you, they even\ntalk together of young Senor Grant! It is satisfactory, but extremely\nstrange.”\n\n“You had better sleep a little, Maria. General Houston is coming to\ndinner.”\n\n“That is understood. When I spoke last to him, I was a woman\nbroken-hearted. To-night I will thank him for all that he has done.\nAh, Roberto! His words to-day went to my, soul--I thought of my Juan--I\nthought of the vision he showed me--I wondered if he knew--if he\nsaw--and heard--” she leaned her head upon her husband’s breast, and he\nkissed away the sorrowful rain.\n\n“He was so sweet! so beautiful! Oh, Roberto!”\n\n“He was God’s greatest gift to us. Maria! dear. Maria! I love you for,\nall the children you have given me; BUT MOST OF ALL, FOR JUAN!”\n\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 1: Little dear.]\n\n[Footnote 2: The loadstone in the bosom is a charm against evil; the bringer of\ngood fortune.]\n\n[Footnote 3: The flag of the Mexican Republic of 1824 was green,\nred and white in color.]\n\n[Footnote 4: The Virgin appealed to in military straits.]\n\n[Footnote 5: Copy from Department of War of the Republic of Texas.]\n\n[Footnote 6: Sign of the Cross.]"
