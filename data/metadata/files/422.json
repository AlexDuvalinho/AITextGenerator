The dingle was dank and dripping.  I\nlighted a fire of coals, and got my forge in readiness.  I then ascended\nto the field, where the chaise was standing as we had left it on the\nprevious evening.  After looking at the cloud-stone near it, now cold,\nand split into three pieces, I set about prying narrowly into the\ncondition of the wheel and axletree--the latter had sustained no damage\nof any consequence, and the wheel, as far as I was able to judge, was\nsound, being only slightly injured in the box.  The only thing requisite\nto set the chaise in a travelling condition appeared to be a linch-pin,\nwhich I determined to make.  Going to the companion wheel, I took out the\nlinch-pin, which I carried down with me to the dingle, to serve as a\nmodel.\n\nI found Belle by this time dressed, and seated near the forge: with a\nslight nod to her like that which a person gives who happens to see an\nacquaintance when his mind is occupied with important business, I\nforthwith set about my work.  Selecting a piece of iron which I thought\nwould serve my purpose, I placed it in the fire, and plying the bellows\nin a furious manner, soon made it hot; then seizing it with the tongs, I\nlaid it on my anvil, and began to beat it with my hammer, according to\nthe rules of my art.  The dingle resounded with my strokes.  Belle sat\nstill, and occasionally smiled, but suddenly started up, and retreated\ntowards her encampment, on a spark which I purposely sent in her\ndirection alighting on her knee.  I found the making of a linch-pin no\neasy matter; it was, however, less difficult than the fabrication of a\npony-shoe; my work, indeed, was much facilitated by my having another pin\nto look at.  In about three-quarters of an hour I had succeeded tolerably\nwell, and had produced a linch-pin which I thought would serve.  During\nall this time, notwithstanding the noise which I was making, the\npostillion never showed his face.  His non-appearance at first alarmed\nme: I was afraid he might be dead, but, on looking into the tent, I found\nhim still buried in the soundest sleep.  \"He must surely be descended\nfrom one of the seven sleepers,\" said I, as I turned away, and resumed my\nwork.  My work finished, I took a little oil, leather, and sand, and\npolished the pin as well as I could; then, summoning Belle, we both went\nto the chaise, where, with her assistance, I put on the wheel.  The linch-\npin which I had made fitted its place very well, and having replaced the\nother, I gazed at the chaise for some time with my heart full of that\nsatisfaction which results from the consciousness of having achieved a\ngreat action; then, after looking at Belle in the hope of obtaining a\ncompliment from her lips, which did not come, I returned to the dingle,\nwithout saying a word, followed by her.  Belle set about making\npreparations for breakfast; and I taking the kettle, went and filled it\nat the spring.  Having hung it over the fire, I went to the tent in which\nthe postillion was still sleeping, and called upon him to arise.  He\nawoke with a start, and stared around him at first with the utmost\nsurprise, not unmixed, I could observe, with a certain degree of fear.  At\nlast, looking in my face, he appeared to recollect himself.  \"I had quite\nforgot,\" said he, as he got up, \"where I was, and all that happened\nyesterday.  However, I remember now the whole affair, thunder-storm,\nthunder-bolt, frightened horses, and all your kindness.  Come, I must see\nafter my coach and horses; I hope we shall be able to repair the damage.\"\n\"The damage is already quite repaired,\" said I, \"as you will see, if you\ncome to the field above.\"  \"You don't say so,\" said the postillion,\ncoming out of the tent; \"well, I am mightily beholden to you.  Good\nmorning, young gentle-woman,\" said he, addressing Belle, who, having\nfinished her preparations, was seated near the fire.  \"Good morning,\nyoung man,\" said Belle, \"I suppose you would be glad of some breakfast;\nhowever, you must wait a little, the kettle does not boil.\"  \"Come and\nlook at your chaise,\" said I; \"but tell me how it happened that the noise\nwhich I have been making did not awake you; for three-quarters of an hour\nat least I was hammering close at your ear.\"  \"I heard you all the time,\"\nsaid the postillion, \"but your hammering made me sleep all the sounder; I\nam used to hear hammering in my morning sleep.  There's a forge close by\nthe room where I sleep when I'm at home, at my inn; for we have all kinds\nof conveniences at my inn--forge, carpenter's shop, and\nwheel-wright's,--so that when I heard you hammering I thought, no doubt,\nthat it was the old noise, and that I was comfortable in my bed at my own\ninn.\"  We now ascended to the field, where I showed the postillion his\nchaise.  He looked at the pin attentively, rubbed his hands, and gave a\nloud laugh.  \"Is it not well done?\" said I.  \"It will do till I get\nhome,\" he replied.  \"And that is all you have to say?\" I demanded.  \"And\nthat's a good deal,\" said he, \"considering who made it.  But don't be\noffended,\" he added, \"I shall prize it all the more for its being made by\na gentleman, and no blacksmith; and so will my governor, when I show it\nto him.  I shan't let it remain where it is, but will keep it, as a\nremembrance of you, as long as I live.\"  He then again rubbed his hands\nwith great glee, and said, \"I will now go and see after my horses, and\nthen to breakfast, partner, if you please.\"  Suddenly, however, looking\nat his hands, he said, \"Before sitting down to breakfast I am in the\nhabit of washing my hands and face: I suppose you could not furnish me\nwith a little soap and water.\"  \"As much water as you please,\" said I,\n\"but if you want soap, I must go and trouble the young gentle-woman for\nsome.\"  \"By no means,\" said the postillion, \"water will do at a pinch.\"\n\"Follow me,\" said I, and leading him to the pond of the frogs and newts,\nI said, \"this is my ewer; you are welcome to part of it--the water is so\nsoft that it is scarcely necessary to add soap to it;\" then lying down on\nthe bank, I plunged my head into the water, then scrubbed my hands and\nface, and afterwards wiped them with some long grass which grew on the\nmargin of the pond.  \"Bravo,\" said the postillion, \"I see you know how to\nmake a shift:\" he then followed my example, declared he never felt more\nrefreshed in his life, and, giving a bound, said, \"he would go and look\nafter his horses.\"\n\nWe then went to look after the horses, which we found not much the worse\nfor having spent the night in the open air.  My companion again inserted\ntheir heads in the corn-bags, and, leaving the animals to discuss their\ncorn, returned with me to the dingle, where we found the kettle boiling.\nWe sat down, and Belle made tea and did the honours of the meal.  The\npostillion was in high spirits, ate heartily, and, to Belle's evident\nsatisfaction, declared that he had never drank better tea in his life, or\nindeed any half so good.  Breakfast over, he said that he must now go and\nharness his horses, as it was high time for him to return to his inn.\nBelle gave him her hand and wished him farewell: the postillion shook her\nhand warmly, and was advancing close up to her--for what purpose I cannot\nsay--whereupon Belle, withdrawing her hand, drew herself up with an air\nwhich caused the postillion to retreat a step or two with an exceedingly\nsheepish look.  Recovering himself, however, he made a low bow, and\nproceeded up the path.  I attended him, and helped to harness his horses\nand put them to the vehicle; he then shook me by the hand, and taking the\nreins and whip, mounted to his seat; ere he drove away he thus addressed\nme: \"If ever I forget your kindness and that of the young woman below,\ndash my buttons.  If ever either of you should enter my inn you may\ndepend upon a warm welcome, the best that can be set before you, and no\nexpense to either, for I will give both of you the best of characters to\nthe governor, who is the very best fellow upon all the road.  As for your\nlinch-pin, I trust it will serve till I get home, when I will take it out\nand keep it in remembrance of you all the days of my life:\" then giving\nthe horses a jerk with his reins, he cracked his whip and drove off.\n\nI returned to the dingle, Belle had removed the breakfast things, and was\nbusy in her own encampment: nothing occurred, worthy of being related,\nfor two hours, at the end of which time Belle departed on a short\nexpedition, and I again found myself alone in the dingle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nThe Man in Black--The Emperor of Germany--Nepotism--Donna\nOlympia--Omnipotence--Camillo Astalli--The Five Propositions.\n\nIn the evening I received another visit from the man in black.  I had\nbeen taking a stroll in the neighbourhood, and was sitting in the dingle\nin rather a listless manner, scarcely knowing how to employ myself; his\ncoming, therefore, was by no means disagreeable to me.  I produced the\nhollands and glass from my tent, where Isopel Berners had requested me to\ndeposit them, and also some lump sugar, then taking the gotch I fetched\nwater from the spring, and, sitting down, begged the man in black to help\nhimself; he was not slow in complying with my desire, and prepared for\nhimself a glass of hollands and water with a lump of sugar in it.  After\nhe had taken two or three sips with evident satisfaction, I, remembering\nhis chuckling exclamation of \"Go to Rome for money,\" when he last left\nthe dingle, took the liberty, after a little conversation, of reminding\nhim of it, whereupon, with a he! he! he! he replied, \"Your idea was not\nquite so original as I supposed.  After leaving you the other night, I\nremembered having read of an Emperor of Germany who conceived the idea of\napplying to Rome for money, and actually put it into practice.\n\n\"Urban the Eighth then occupied the papal chair, of the family of the\nBarbarini, nicknamed the Mosche, or Flies, from the circumstance of bees\nbeing their armorial bearing.  The Emperor having exhausted all his money\nin endeavouring to defend the church against Gustavus Adolphus, the great\nKing of Sweden, who was bent on its destruction, applied in his necessity\nto the Pope for a loan of money.  The Pope, however, and his relations,\nwhose cellars were at that time full of the money of the church, which\nthey had been plundering for years, refused to lend him a scudo;\nwhereupon a pasquinade picture was stuck up at Rome, representing the\nchurch lying on a bed, gashed with dreadful wounds, and beset all over\nwith flies, which were sucking her, whilst the Emperor of Germany was\nkneeling before her with a miserable face, requesting a little money\ntowards carrying on the war against the heretics, to which the poor\nchurch was made to say: 'How can I assist you, O my champion, do you not\nsee that the flies have sucked me to the very bones?'  Which story,\" said\nhe, \"shows that the idea of going to Rome for money was not quite so\noriginal as I imagined the other night, though utterly preposterous.\n\n\"This affair,\" said he, \"occurred in what were called the days of\nnepotism.  Certain popes, who wished to make themselves in some degree\nindependent of the cardinals, surrounded themselves with their nephews\nand the rest of their family, who sucked the church and Christendom as\nmuch as they could, none doing so more effectually than the relations of\nUrban the Eighth, at whose death, according to the book called the\n'Nipotismo di Roma,' there were in the Barbarini family two hundred and\ntwenty-seven governments, abbeys and high dignities; and so much hard\ncash in their possession, that threescore and ten mules were scarcely\nsufficient to convey the plunder of one of them to Palestrina.\"  He\nadded, however, that it was probable that Christendom fared better whilst\nthe popes were thus independent, as it was less sucked, whereas before\nand after that period it was sucked by hundreds instead of tens, by the\ncardinals and all their relations, instead of by the pope and his nephews\nonly.\n\nThen, after drinking rather copiously of his hollands, he said that it\nwas certainly no bad idea of the popes to surround themselves with\nnephews, on whom they bestowed great church dignities, as by so doing\nthey were tolerably safe from poison, whereas a pope, if abandoned to the\ncardinals, might at any time be made away with by them, provided they\nthought that he lived too long, or that he seemed disposed to do anything\nwhich they disliked; adding, that Ganganelli would never have been\npoisoned provided he had had nephews about him to take care of his life,\nand to see that nothing unholy was put into his food, or a bustling\nstirring brother's wife like Donna Olympia.  He then with a he! he! he!\nasked me if I had ever read the book called the \"Nipotismo di Roma\"; and\non my replying in the negative, he told me that it was a very curious and\nentertaining book, which he occasionally looked at in an idle hour, and\nproceeded to relate to me anecdotes out of the \"Nipotismo di Roma,\" about\nthe successor of Urban, Innocent the Tenth, and Donna Olympia, showing\nhow fond he was of her, and how she cooked his food, and kept the\ncardinals away from it, and how she and her creatures plundered\nChristendom, with the sanction of the Pope, until Christendom, becoming\nenraged, insisted that he should put her away, which he did for a time,\nputting a nephew--one Camillo Astalli--in her place, in which, however,\nhe did not continue long; for the Pope, conceiving a pique against him,\nbanished him from his sight, and recalled Donna Olympia, who took care of\nhis food, and plundered Christendom until Pope Innocent died.\n\nI said that I only wondered that between pope and cardinals the whole\nsystem of Rome had not long fallen to the ground, and was told, in reply,\nthat its not having fallen was the strongest proof of its vital power,\nand the absolute necessity for the existence of the system.  That the\nsystem, notwithstanding its occasional disorders, went on.  Popes and\ncardinals might prey upon its bowels, and sell its interests, but the\nsystem survived.  The cutting off of this or that member was not able to\ncause Rome any vital loss; for, as soon as she lost a member, the loss\nwas supplied by her own inherent vitality; though her popes had been\npoisoned by cardinals, and her cardinals by popes; and though priests\noccasionally poisoned popes, cardinals, and each other, after all that\nhad been, and might be, she had still, and would ever have, her priests,\ncardinals, and pope.\n\nFinding the man in black so communicative and reasonable, I determined to\nmake the best of my opportunity, and learn from him all I could with\nrespect to the papal system, and told him that he would particularly\noblige me by telling me who the Pope of Rome was; and received for\nanswer, that he was an old man elected by a majority of cardinals to the\npapal chair; who, immediately after his election, became omnipotent and\nequal to God on earth.  On my begging him not to talk such nonsense, and\nasking him how a person could be omnipotent who could not always preserve\nhimself from poison, even when fenced round by nephews, or protected by a\nbustling woman, he, after taking a long sip of hollands and water, told\nme that I must not expect too much from omnipotence; for example, that as\nit would be unreasonable to expect that One above could annihilate the\npast--for instance, the Seven Years' War, or the French Revolution--though\nany one who believed in Him would acknowledge Him to be omnipotent, so\nwould it be unreasonable for the faithful to expect that the Pope could\nalways guard himself from poison.  Then, after looking at me for a moment\nstedfastly, and taking another sip, he told me that popes had frequently\ndone impossibilities; for example, Innocent the Tenth had created a\nnephew; for, not liking particularly any of his real nephews, he had\ncreated the said Camillo Astalli his nephew; asking me, with a he! he!\n\"What but omnipotence could make a young man nephew to a person to whom\nhe was not in the slightest degree related?\"  On my observing that of\ncourse no one believed that the young fellow was really the Pope's\nnephew, though the Pope might have adopted him as such, the man in black\nreplied, \"that the reality of the nephewship of Camillo Astalli had\nhitherto never become a point of faith; let, however, the present pope,\nor any other pope, proclaim that it is necessary to believe in the\nreality of the nephewship of Camillo Astalli, and see whether the\nfaithful would not believe in it.  Who can doubt that,\" he added, \"seeing\nthat they believe in the reality of the five propositions of Jansenius?\nThe Jesuits, wishing to ruin the Jansenists, induced a pope to declare\nthat such and such damnable opinions, which they called five\npropositions, were to be found in a book written by Jansen, though, in\nreality, no such propositions were to be found there; whereupon the\nexistence of these propositions became forthwith a point of faith to the\nfaithful.  Do you then think,\" he demanded, \"that there is one of the\nfaithful who would not swallow, if called upon, the nephewship of Camillo\nAstalli as easily as the five propositions of Jansenius?\"  \"Surely,\nthen,\" said I, \"the faithful must be a pretty pack of simpletons!\"\nWhereupon the man in black exclaimed, \"What! a Protestant, and an\ninfringer of the rights of faith!  Here's a fellow, who would feel\nhimself insulted if any one were to ask him how he could believe in the\nmiraculous conception, calling people simpletons who swallow the five\npropositions of Jansenius, and are disposed, if called upon, to swallow\nthe reality of the nephewship of Camillo Astalli.\"\n\nI was about to speak, when I was interrupted by the arrival of Belle.\nAfter unharnessing her donkey, and adjusting her person a little, she\ncame and sat down by us.  In the meantime I had helped my companion to\nsome more hollands and water, and had plunged with him into yet deeper\ndiscourse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nNecessity of Religion--The Great Indian One--Image-worship--Shakespeare--The\nPat Answer--Krishna--Amen.\n\nHaving told the man in black that I should like to know all the truth\nwith regard to the Pope and his system, he assured me he should be\ndelighted to give me all the information in his power; that he had come\nto the dingle, not so much for the sake of the good cheer which I was in\nthe habit of giving him, as in the hope of inducing me to enlist under\nthe banners of Rome, and to fight in her cause; and that he had no doubt\nthat, by speaking out frankly to me, he ran the best chance of winning me\nover.\n\nHe then proceeded to tell me that the experience of countless ages had\nproved the necessity of religion; the necessity, he would admit, was only\nfor simpletons; but as nine-tenths of the dwellers upon this earth were\nsimpletons, it would never do for sensible people to run counter to their\nfolly, but, on the contrary, it was their wisest course to encourage them\nin it, always provided that, by so doing, sensible people would derive\nadvantage; that the truly sensible people of this world were the priests,\nwho, without caring a straw for religion for its own sake, made use of it\nas a cord by which to draw the simpletons after them; that there were\nmany religions in this world, all of which had been turned to excellent\naccount by the priesthood; but that the one the best adapted for the\npurposes of priestcraft was the popish, which, he said, was the oldest in\nthe world and the best calculated to endure.  On my inquiring what he\nmeant by saying the popish religion was the oldest in the world, whereas\nthere could be no doubt that the Greek and Roman religion had existed\nlong before it, to say nothing of the old Indian religion still in\nexistence and vigour; he said, with a nod, after taking a sip at his\nglass, that, between me and him, the popish religion, that of Greece and\nRome, and the old Indian system were, in reality, one and the same.\n\n\"You told me that you intended to be frank,\" said I; \"but, however frank\nyou may be, I think you are rather wild.\"\n\n\"We priests of Rome,\" said the man in black, \"even those amongst us who\ndo not go much abroad, know a great deal about church matters, of which\nyou heretics have very little idea.  Those of our brethren of the\nPropaganda, on their return home from distant missions, not unfrequently\ntell us very strange things relating to our dear mother; for example, our\nfirst missionaries to the East were not slow in discovering and telling\nto their brethren that our religion and the great Indian one were\nidentical, no more difference between them than between Ram and Rome.\nPriests, convents, beads, prayers, processions, fastings, penances, all\nthe same, not forgetting anchorites and vermin, he! he!  The pope they\nfound under the title of the grand lama, a sucking child surrounded by an\nimmense number of priests.  Our good brethren, some two hundred years\nago, had a hearty laugh, which their successors have often re-echoed;\nthey said that helpless suckling and its priests put them so much in mind\nof their own old man, surrounded by his cardinals, he! he!  Old age is\nsecond childhood.\"\n\n\"Did they find Christ?\" said I.\n\n\"They found him too,\" said the man in black, \"that is, they saw his\nimage; he is considered in India as a pure kind of being, and on that\naccount, perhaps, is kept there rather in the background, even as he is\nhere.\"\n\n\"All this is very mysterious to me,\" said I.\n\n\"Very likely,\" said the man in black; \"but of this I am tolerably sure,\nand so are most of those of Rome, that modern Rome had its religion from\nancient Rome, which had its religion from the East.\"\n\n\"But how?\" I demanded.\n\n\"It was brought about, I believe, by the wanderings of nations,\" said the\nman in black.  \"A brother of the Propaganda, a very learned man, once\ntold me--I do not mean Mezzofanti, who has not five ideas--this brother\nonce told me that all we of the Old World, from Calcutta to Dublin, are\nof the same stock, and were originally of the same language, and--\"\n\n\"All of one religion,\" I put in.\n\n\"All of one religion,\" said the man in black; \"and now follow different\nmodifications of the same religion.\"\n\n\"We Christians are not image-worshippers,\" said I.\n\n\"You heretics are not, you mean,\" said the man in black; \"but you will be\nput down, just as you have always been, though others may rise up after\nyou; the true religion is image-worship; people may strive against it,\nbut they will only work themselves to an oil; how did it fare with that\nGreek Emperor, the Iconoclast, what was his name, Leon the Isaurian?  Did\nnot his image-breaking cost him Italy, the fairest province of his\nempire, and did not ten fresh images start up at home for every one which\nhe demolished?  Oh! you little know the craving which the soul sometimes\nfeels after a good bodily image.\"\n\n\"I have indeed no conception of it,\" said I; \"I have an abhorrence of\nidolatry--the idea of bowing before a graven figure!\"\n\n\"The idea, indeed!\" said Belle, who had now joined us.\n\n\"Did you never bow before that of Shakespeare?\" said the man in black,\naddressing himself to me, after a low bow to Belle.\n\n\"I don't remember that I ever did,\" said I, \"but even suppose I did?\"\n\n\"Suppose you did,\" said the man in black; \"shame on you, Mr. Hater of\nIdolatry; why, the very supposition brings you to the ground; you must\nmake figures of Shakespeare, must you? then why not of St. Antonio, or\nIgnacio, or of a greater personage still!  I know what you are going to\nsay,\" he cried, interrupting me, as I was about to speak.  \"You don't\nmake his image in order to pay it divine honours, but only to look at it,\nand think of Shakespeare; but this looking at a thing in order to think\nof a person is the very basis of idolatry.  Shakespeare's works are not\nsufficient for you; no more are the Bible or the legend of Saint Anthony\nor Saint Ignacio for us, that is for those of us who believe in them; I\ntell you, Zingara, that no religion can exist long which rejects a good\nbodily image.\"\n\n\"Do you think,\" said I, \"that Shakespeare's works would not exist without\nhis image?\"\n\n\"I believe,\" said the man in black, \"that Shakespeare's image is looked\nat more than his works, and will be looked at, and perhaps adored, when\nthey are forgotten.  I am surprised that they have not been forgotten\nlong ago; I am no admirer of them.\"\n\n\"But I can't imagine,\" said I, \"how you will put aside the authority of\nMoses.  If Moses strove against image-worship, should not his doing so be\nconclusive as to the impropriety of the practice; what higher authority\ncan you have than that of Moses?\"\n\n\"The practice of the great majority of the human race,\" said the man in\nblack, \"and the recurrence to image-worship where image-worship has been\nabolished.  Do you know that Moses is considered by the church as no\nbetter than a heretic, and though, for particular reasons, it has been\nobliged to adopt his writings, the adoption was merely a sham one, as it\nnever paid the slightest attention to them?  No, no, the church was never\nled by Moses, nor by one mightier than he, whose doctrine it has equally\nnullified--I allude to Krishna in his second avatar; the church, it is\ntrue, governs in his name, but not unfrequently gives him the lie, if he\nhappens to have said anything which it dislikes.  Did you never hear the\nreply which Padre Paolo Segani made to the French Protestant Jean\nAnthoine Guerin, who had asked him whether it was easier for Christ to\nhave been mistaken in his Gospel, than for the Pope to be mistaken in his\ndecrees?\"\n\n\"I never heard their names before,\" said I.\n\n\"The answer was pat,\" said the man in black, \"though he who made it was\nconfessedly the most ignorant fellow of the very ignorant order to which\nhe belonged, the Augustine.  'Christ might err as a man,' said he, 'but\nthe Pope can never err, being God.'  The whole story is related in the\nNipotismo.\"\n\n\"I wonder you should ever have troubled yourself with Christ at all,\"\nsaid I.\n\n\"What was to be done?\" said the man in black; \"the power of that name\nsuddenly came over Europe, like the power of a mighty wind; it was said\nto have come from Judea, and from Judea it probably came when it first\nbegan to agitate minds in these parts; but it seems to have been known in\nthe remote East, more or less, for thousands of years previously.  It\nfilled people's minds with madness; it was followed by books which were\nnever much regarded, as they contained little of insanity; but the name!\nwhat fury that breathed into people! the books were about peace and\ngentleness, but the name was the most horrible of war-cries--those who\nwished to uphold old names at first strove to oppose it, but their\nefforts were feeble, and they had no good war-cry; what was Mars as a war-\ncry compared with the name of . . . ?  It was said that they persecuted\nterribly, but who said so?  The Christians.  The Christians could have\ngiven them a lesson in the art of persecution, and eventually did so.\nNone but Christians have ever been good persecutors; well, the old\nreligion succumbed, Christianity prevailed, for the ferocious is sure to\nprevail over the gentle.\"\n\n\"I thought,\" said I, \"you stated a little time ago that the Popish\nreligion and the ancient Roman are the same?\"\n\n\"In every point but that name, that Krishna and the fury and love of\npersecution which it inspired,\" said the man in black.  \"A hot blast came\nfrom the East, sounding Krishna; it absolutely maddened people's minds,\nand the people would call themselves his children; we will not belong to\nJupiter any longer, we will belong to Krishna, and they did belong to\nKrishna; that is in name, but in nothing else; for who ever cared for\nKrishna in the Christian world, or who ever regarded the words attributed\nto him, or put them in practice?\"\n\n\"Why, we Protestants regard his words, and endeavour to practise what\nthey enjoin as much as possible.\"\n\n\"But you reject his image,\" said the man in black; \"better reject his\nwords than his image: no religion can exist long which rejects a good\nbodily image.  Why, the very negro barbarians of High Barbary could give\nyou a lesson on that point; they have their fetish images, to which they\nlook for help in their afflictions; they have likewise a high priest,\nwhom they call--\"\n\n\"Mumbo Jumbo,\" said I; \"I know all about him already.\"\n\n\"How came you to know anything about him?\" said the man in black, with a\nlook of some surprise.\n\n\"Some of us poor Protestants tinkers,\" said I, \"though we live in\ndingles, are also acquainted with a thing or two.\"\n\n\"I really believe you are,\" said the man in black, staring at me; \"but,\nin connection with this Mumbo Jumbo, I could relate to you a comical\nstory about a fellow, an English servant, I once met at Rome.\"\n\n\"It would be quite unnecessary,\" said I; \"I would much sooner hear you\ntalk about Krishna, his words and image.\"\n\n\"Spoken like a true heretic,\" said the man in black; \"one of the faithful\nwould have placed his image before his words; for what are all the words\nin the world compared with a good bodily image!\"\n\n\"I believe you occasionally quote his words?\" said I.\n\n\"He! he!\" said the man in black; \"occasionally.\"\n\n\"For example,\" said I, \"upon this rock I will found my church.\"\n\n\"He! he!\" said the man in black; \"you must really become one of us.\"\n\n\"Yet you must have had some difficulty in getting the rock to Rome?\"\n\n\"None whatever,\" said the man in black; \"faith can remove mountains, to\nsay nothing of rocks--ho! ho!\"\n\n\"But I cannot imagine,\" said I, \"what advantage you could derive from\nperverting those words of Scripture in which the Saviour talks about\neating his body.\"\n\n\"I do not know, indeed, why we troubled our heads about the matter at\nall,\" said the man in black; \"but when you talk about perverting the\nmeaning of the text, you speak ignorantly, Mr. Tinker; when he whom you\ncall the Saviour gave his followers the sop, and bade them eat it,\ntelling them it was his body, he delicately alluded to what it was\nincumbent upon them to do after his death, namely, to eat his body.\"\n\n\"You do not mean to say that he intended they should actually eat his\nbody?\"\n\n\"Then you suppose ignorantly,\" said the man in black; \"eating the bodies\nof the dead was a heathenish custom, practised by the heirs and legatees\nof people who left property; and this custom is alluded to in the text.\"\n\n\"But what has the New Testament to do with heathen customs,\" said I,\n\"except to destroy them?\"\n\n\"More than you suppose,\" said the man in black.  \"We priests of Rome, who\nhave long lived at Rome, know much better what the New Testament is made\nof than the heretics and their theologians, not forgetting their Tinkers;\nthough I confess some of the latter have occasionally surprised us--for\nexample, Bunyan.  The New Testament is crowded with allusions to heathen\ncustoms, and with words connected with pagan sorcery.  Now, with respect\nto words, I would fain have you, who pretend to be a philologist, tell me\nthe meaning of Amen.\"\n\nI made no answer.\n\n\"We of Rome,\" said the man in black, \"know two or three things of which\nthe heretics are quite ignorant; for example, there are those amongst\nus--those, too, who do not pretend to be philologists--who know what Amen\nis, and, moreover, how we got it.  We got it from our ancestors, the\npriests of ancient Rome; and they got the word from their ancestors of\nthe East, the priests of Buddh and Brahma.\"\n\n\"And what is the meaning of the word?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Amen,\" said the man in black, \"is a modification of the old Hindoo\nformula, Omani batsikhom, by the almost ceaseless repetition of which the\nIndians hope to be received finally to the rest or state of forgetfulness\nof Buddh or Brahma; a foolish practice you will say, but are you heretics\nmuch wiser, who are continually sticking Amen to the end of your prayers,\nlittle knowing when you do so, that you are consigning yourselves to the\nrepose of Buddh!  Oh, what hearty laughs our missionaries have had when\ncomparing the eternally-sounding Eastern gibberish of Omani batsikhom,\nOmani batsikhom, and the Ave Maria and Amen Jesus of our own idiotical\ndevotees.\"\n\n\"I have nothing to say about the Ave Marias and Amens of your\nsuperstitious devotees,\" said I; \"I dare say that they use them\nnonsensically enough, but in putting Amen to the end of a prayer, we\nmerely intend to express, 'So let it be.'\"\n\n\"It means nothing of the kind,\" said the man in black; \"and the Hindoos\nmight just as well put your national oath at the end of their prayers, as\nperhaps they will after a great many thousand years, when English is\nforgotten, and only a few words of it remembered by dim tradition without\nbeing understood.  How strange if, after the lapse of four thousand\nyears, the Hindoos should damn themselves to the blindness so dear to\ntheir present masters, even as their masters at present consign\nthemselves to the forgetfulness so dear to the Hindoos; but my glass has\nbeen empty for a considerable time; perhaps, Bellissima Biondina,\" said\nhe, addressing Belle, \"you will deign to replenish it?\"\n\n\"I shall do no such thing,\" said Belle, \"you have drunk quite enough, and\ntalked more than enough, and to tell you the truth I wish you would leave\nus alone.\"\n\n\"Shame on you, Belle,\" said I; \"consider the obligations of hospitality.\"\n\n\"I am sick of that word,\" said Belle, \"you are so frequently misusing it;\nwere this place not Mumpers' Dingle, and consequently as free to the\nfellow as ourselves, I would lead him out of it.\"\n\n\"Pray be quiet, Belle,\" said I.  \"You had better help yourself,\" said I,\naddressing myself to the man in black, \"the lady is angry with you.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for it,\" said the man in black; \"if she is angry with me, I\nam not so with her, and shall be always proud to wait upon her; in the\nmeantime, I will wait upon myself.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nThe Proposal--The Scotch Novel--Latitude--Miracles--Pestilent\nHeretics--Old Fraser--Wonderful Texts--No Armenian.\n\nThe man in black having helped himself to some more of his favourite\nbeverage, and tasted it, I thus addressed him: \"The evening is getting\nrather advanced, and I can see that this lady,\" pointing to Belle, \"is\nanxious for her tea, which she prefers to take cosily and comfortably\nwith me in the dingle: the place, it is true, is as free to you as to\nourselves, nevertheless, as we are located here by necessity, whilst you\nmerely come as a visitor, I must take the liberty of telling you that we\nshall be glad to be alone, as soon as you have said what you have to say,\nand have finished the glass of refreshment at present in your hand.  I\nthink you said some time ago that one of your motives for coming hither\nwas to induce me to enlist under the banner of Rome.  I wish to know\nwhether that was really the case?\"\n\n\"Decidedly so,\" said the man in black; \"I come here principally in the\nhope of enlisting you in our regiment, in which I have no doubt you could\ndo us excellent service.\"\n\n\"Would you enlist my companion as well?\" I demanded.\n\n\"We should be only too proud to have her among us, whether she comes with\nyou or alone,\" said the man in black, with a polite bow to Belle.\n\n\"Before we give you an answer,\" I replied, \"I would fain know more about\nyou; perhaps you will declare your name?\"\n\n\"That I will never do,\" said the man in black; \"no one in England knows\nit but myself, and I will not declare it, even in a dingle; as for the\nrest, _Sono un Prete Cattolico Appostolico_--that is all that many a one\nof us can say for himself, and it assuredly means a great deal.\"\n\n\"We will now proceed to business,\" said I.  \"You must be aware that we\nEnglish are generally considered a self-interested people.\"\n\n\"And with considerable justice,\" said the man in black, drinking.  \"Well,\nyou are a person of acute perception, and I will presently make it\nevident to you that it would be to your interest to join with us.  You\nare at present, evidently, in very needy circumstances, and are lost, not\nonly to yourself, but to the world; but should you enlist with us, I\ncould find you an occupation not only agreeable, but one in which your\ntalents would have free scope.  I would introduce you in the various\ngrand houses here in England, to which I have myself admission, as a\nsurprising young gentleman of infinite learning, who by dint of study has\ndiscovered that the Roman is the only true faith.  I tell you confidently\nthat our popish females would make a saint, nay, a God of you; they are\nfools enough for anything.  There is one person in particular with whom I\nwould wish to make you acquainted, in the hope that you would be able to\nhelp me to perform good service to the holy see.  He is a gouty old\nfellow, of some learning, residing in an old hall, near the great western\nseaport, and is one of the very few amongst the English Catholics\npossessing a grain of sense.  I think you could help us to govern him,\nfor he is not unfrequently disposed to be restive, asks us strange\nquestions--occasionally threatens us with his crutch; and behaves so that\nwe are often afraid that we shall lose him, or, rather, his property,\nwhich he has bequeathed to us, and which is enormous.  I am sure that you\ncould help us to deal with him; sometimes with your humour, sometimes\nwith your learning, and perhaps occasionally with your fists.\"\n\n\"And in what manner would you provide for my companion?\" said I.\n\n\"We would place her at once,\" said the man in black, \"in the house of two\nhighly respectable Catholic ladies in this neighbourhood, where she would\nbe treated with every care and consideration till her conversion should\nbe accomplished in a regular manner; we would then remove her to a female\nmonastic establishment, where, after undergoing a year's probation,\nduring which time she would be instructed in every elegant\naccomplishment, she should take the veil.  Her advancement would speedily\nfollow, for, with such a face and figure, she would make a capital lady\nabbess, especially in Italy, to which country she would probably be sent;\nladies of her hair and complexion--to say nothing of her height--being a\ncuriosity in the south.  With a little care and management she could soon\nobtain a vast reputation for sanctity; and who knows but after her death\nshe might become a glorified saint--he! he!  Sister Maria Theresa, for\nthat is the name I propose you should bear.  Holy Mother Maria\nTheresa--glorified and celestial saint, I have the honour of drinking to\nyour health,\" and the man in black drank.\n\n\"Well, Belle,\" said I, \"what have you to say to the gentleman's\nproposal?\"\n\n\"That if he goes on in this way I will break his glass against his\nmouth.\"\n\n\"You have heard the lady's answer,\" said I.\n\n\"I have,\" said the man in black, \"and shall not press the matter.  I\ncan't help, however, repeating that she would make a capital lady abbess;\nshe would keep the nuns in order, I warrant her; no easy matter!  Break\nthe glass against my mouth--he! he!  How she would send the holy utensils\nflying at the nuns' heads occasionally, and just the person to wring the\nnose of Satan, should he venture to appear one night in her cell in the\nshape of a handsome black man.  No offence, madam, no offence, pray\nretain your seat,\" said he, observing that Belle had started up; \"I mean\nno offence.  Well, if you will not consent to be an abbess, perhaps you\nwill consent to follow this young Zingaro, and to co-operate with him and\nus.  I am a priest, madam, and can join you both in an instant, _connubio\nstabili_, as I suppose the knot has not been tied already.\"\n\n\"Hold your mumping gibberish,\" said Belle, \"and leave the dingle this\nmoment, for though 'tis free to every one, you have no right to insult me\nin it.\"\n\n\"Pray be pacified,\" said I to Belle, getting up, and placing myself\nbetween her and the man in black, \"he will presently leave, take my word\nfor it--there, sit down again,\" said I, as I led her to her seat; then,\nresuming my own, I said to the man in black: \"I advise you to leave the\ndingle as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"I should wish to have your answer to my proposal first,\" said he.\n\n\"Well, then, here you shall have it: I will not entertain your proposal;\nI detest your schemes: they are both wicked and foolish.\"\n\n\"Wicked,\" said the man in black, \"have they not--he! he!--the furtherance\nof religion in view?\"\n\n\"A religion,\" said I, \"in which you yourself do not believe, and which\nyou contemn.\"\n\n\"Whether I believe in it or not,\" said the man in black, \"it is adapted\nfor the generality of the human race; so I will forward it, and advise\nyou to do the same.  It was nearly extirpated in these regions, but it is\nspringing up again, owing to circumstances.  Radicalism is a good friend\nto us; all the liberals laud up our system out of hatred to the\nEstablished Church, though our system is ten times less liberal than the\nChurch of England.  Some of them have really come over to us.  I myself\nconfess a baronet who presided over the first radical meeting ever held\nin England--he was an atheist when he came over to us, in the hope of\nmortifying his own church--but he is now--ho! ho!--a real Catholic\ndevotee--quite afraid of my threats; I make him frequently scourge\nhimself before me.  Well, Radicalism does us good service, especially\namongst the lower classes, for Radicalism chiefly flourishes amongst\nthem; for though a baronet or two may be found amongst the radicals, and\nperhaps as many lords--fellows who have been discarded by their own order\nfor clownishness, or something they have done--it incontestably\nflourishes best among the lower orders.  Then the love of what is foreign\nis a great friend to us; this love is chiefly confined to the middle and\nupper classes.  Some admire the French, and imitate them; others must\nneeds be Spaniards, dress themselves up in a zamarra, stick a cigar in\ntheir mouth, and say, 'Carajo.'  Others would pass for Germans; he! he!\nthe idea of any one wishing to pass for a German! but what has done us\nmore service than anything else in these regions--I mean amidst the\nmiddle classes--has been the novel, the Scotch novel.  The good folks,\nsince they have read the novels, have become Jacobites; and, because all\nthe Jacobs were Papists, the good folks must become Papists also, or, at\nleast, papistically inclined.  The very Scotch Presbyterians, since they\nhave read the novels, are become all but Papists; I speak advisedly,\nhaving lately been amongst them.  There's a trumpery bit of a half papist\nsect, called the Scotch Episcopalian Church, which lay dormant and nearly\nforgotten for upwards of a hundred years, which has of late got\nwonderfully into fashion in Scotland, because, forsooth, some of the long-\nhaired gentry of the novels were said to belong to it, such as Montrose\nand Dundee; and to this the Presbyterians are going over in throngs,\ntraducing and vilifying their own forefathers, or denying them\naltogether, and calling themselves descendants of--ho! ho! ho!--Scottish\nCavaliers!!!  I have heard them myself repeating snatches of Jacobite\nditties about 'Bonnie Dundee,' and--\n\n   \"'Come, fill up my cup, and fill up my can,\n   And saddle my horse, and call up my man.'\n\nThere's stuff for you!  Not that I object to the first part of the ditty.\nIt is natural enough that a Scotchman should cry, 'Come, fill up my cup!'\nmore especially if he's drinking at another person's expense--all\nScotchmen being fond of liquor at free cost: but 'Saddle his\nhorse!!!'--for what purpose, I would ask?  Where is the use of saddling a\nhorse, unless you can ride him? and where was there ever a Scotchman who\ncould ride?\"\n\n\"Of course you have not a drop of Scotch blood in your veins,\" said I,\n\"otherwise you would never have uttered that last sentence.\"\n\n\"Don't be too sure of that,\" said the man in black; \"you know little of\nPopery if you imagine that it cannot extinguish love of country, even in\na Scotchman.  A thorough-going Papist--and who more thorough-going than\nmyself?--cares nothing for his country; and why should he? he belongs to\na system, and not to a country.\"\n\n\"One thing,\" said I, \"connected with you, I cannot understand; you call\nyourself a thorough-going Papist, yet are continually saying the most\npungent things against Popery, and turning to unbounded ridicule those\nwho show any inclination to embrace it.\"\n\n\"Rome is a very sensible old body,\" said the man in black, \"and little\ncares what her children say, provided they do her bidding.  She knows\nseveral things, and amongst others, that no servants work so hard and\nfaithfully as those who curse their masters at every stroke they do.  She\nwas not fool enough to be angry with the Miquelets of Alba, who renounced\nher, and called her 'puta' all the time they were cutting the throats of\nthe Netherlanders.  Now, if she allowed her faithful soldiers the\nlatitude of renouncing her, and calling her 'puta' in the market-place,\nthink not she is so unreasonable as to object to her faithful priests\noccasionally calling her 'puta' in the dingle.\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"suppose some one were to tell the world some of the\ndisorderly things which her priests say in the dingle?\"\n\n\"He would have the fate of Cassandra,\" said the man in black; \"no one\nwould believe him--yes, the priests would: but they would make no sign of\nbelief.  They believe in the Alcoran des Cordeliers--that is, those who\nhave read it; but they make no sign.\"\n\n\"A pretty system,\" said I, \"which extinguishes love of country and of\neverything noble, and brings the minds of its ministers to a parity with\nthose of devils, who delight in nothing but mischief.\"\n\n\"The system,\" said the man in black, \"is a grand one, with unbounded\nvitality.  Compare it with your Protestantism, and you will see the\ndifference.  Popery is ever at work, whilst Protestantism is supine.  A\npretty church, indeed, the Protestant!  Why, it can't even work a\nmiracle.\"\n\n\"Can your church work miracles?\" I demanded.\n\n\"That was the very question,\" said the man in black, \"which the ancient\nBritish clergy asked of Austin Monk, after they had been fools enough to\nacknowledge their own inability.  'We don't pretend to work miracles; do\nyou?'  'Oh! dear me, yes,' said Austin; 'we find no difficulty in the\nmatter.  We can raise the dead, we can make the blind see; and to\nconvince you, I will give sight to the blind.  Here is this blind Saxon,\nwhom you cannot cure, but on whose eyes I will manifest my power, in\norder to show the difference between the true and the false church;' and\nforthwith, with the assistance of a handkerchief and a little hot water,\nhe opened the eyes of the barbarian.  So we manage matters!  A pretty\nchurch, that old British church, which could not work miracles--quite as\nhelpless as the modern one.  The fools! was birdlime so scarce a thing\namongst them?--and were the properties of warm water so unknown to them,\nthat they could not close a pair of eyes and open them?\"\n\n\"It's a pity,\" said I, \"that the British clergy at that interview with\nAustin, did not bring forward a blind Welshman, and ask the monk to\noperate upon him.\"\n\n\"Clearly,\" said the man in black; \"that's what they ought to have done;\nbut they were fools without a single resource.\"  Here he took a sip at\nhis glass.\n\n\"But they did not believe in the miracle?\" said I.\n\n\"And what did their not believing avail them?\" said the man in black.\n\"Austin remained master of the field, and they went away holding their\nheads down, and muttering to themselves.  What a fine subject for a\npainting would be Austin's opening the eyes of the Saxon barbarian, and\nthe discomfiture of the British clergy!  I wonder it has not been\npainted!--he! he!\"\n\n\"I suppose your church still performs miracles occasionally!\" said I.\n\n\"It does,\" said the man in black.  \"The Rev. --- has lately been\nperforming miracles in Ireland, destroying devils that had got possession\nof people; he has been eminently successful.  In two instances he not\nonly destroyed the devils, but the lives of the people possessed--he! he!\nOh! there is so much energy in our system; we are always at work, whilst\nProtestantism is supine.\"\n\n\"You must not imagine,\" said I, \"that all Protestants are supine; some of\nthem appear to be filled with unbounded zeal.  They deal, it is true, not\nin lying miracles, but they propagate God's Word.  I remember only a few\nmonths ago, having occasion for a Bible, going to an establishment, the\nobject of which was to send Bibles all over the world.  The supporters of\nthat establishment could have no self-interested views; for I was\nsupplied by them with a noble-sized Bible at a price so small as to\npreclude the idea that it could bring any profit to the vendors.\"\n\nThe countenance of the man in black slightly fell.  \"I know the people to\nwhom you allude,\" said he; \"indeed, unknown to them, I have frequently\nbeen to see them, and observed their ways.  I tell you frankly that there\nis not a set of people in this kingdom who have caused our church so much\ntrouble and uneasiness.  I should rather say that they alone cause us\nany; for as for the rest, what with their drowsiness, their plethora,\ntheir folly and their vanity, they are doing us anything but mischief.\nThese fellows are a pestilent set of heretics, whom we would gladly see\nburnt; they are, with the most untiring perseverance, and in spite of\ndivers minatory declarations of the holy father, scattering their books\nabroad through all Europe, and have caused many people in Catholic\ncountries to think that hitherto their priesthood have endeavoured, as\nmuch as possible, to keep them blinded.  There is one fellow amongst them\nfor whom we entertain a particular aversion; a big, burly parson, with\nthe face of a lion, the voice of a buffalo, and a fist like a\nsledge-hammer.  The last time I was there, I observed that his eye was\nupon me, and I did not like the glance he gave me at all; I observed him\nclench his fist, and I took my departure as fast as I conveniently could.\nWhether he suspected who I was, I know not; but I did not like his look\nat all, and do not intend to go again.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said I, \"you confess that you have redoubtable enemies to\nyour plans in these regions, and that even amongst the ecclesiastics\nthere are some widely different from those of the plethoric and Platitude\nschools?\"\n\n\"It is but too true,\" said the man in black; \"and if the rest of your\nchurch were like them we should quickly bid adieu to all hope of\nconverting these regions, but we are thankful to be able to say that such\nfolks are not numerous; there are, moreover, causes at work quite\nsufficient to undermine even their zeal.  Their sons return at the\nvacations, from Oxford and Cambridge, puppies, full of the nonsense which\nthey have imbibed from Platitude professors; and this nonsense they\nretail at home, where it fails not to make some impression, whilst the\ndaughters scream--I beg their pardons--warble about Scotland's Montrose,\nand Bonny Dundee, and all the Jacobs; so we have no doubt that their\npapas' zeal about the propagation of such a vulgar book as the Bible will\nin a very little time be terribly diminished.  Old Rome will win, so you\nhad better join her.\"\n\nAnd the man in black drained the last drop in his glass.\n\n\"Never,\" said I, \"will I become the slave of Rome.\"\n\n\"She will allow you latitude,\" said the man in black; \"do but serve her,\nand she will allow you to call her 'puta' at a decent time and place, her\npopes occasionally call her 'puta.'  A pope has been known to start from\nhis bed at midnight and rush out into the corridor, and call out 'puta'\nthree times in a voice which pierced the Vatican; that pope was--\"\n\n\"Alexander the Sixth, I dare say,\" said I; \"the greatest monster that\never existed, though the worthiest head which the pope system ever had--so\nhis conscience was not always still.  I thought it had been seared with a\nbrand of iron.\"\n\n\"I did not allude to him, but to a much more modern pope,\" said the man\nin black; \"it is true he brought the word, which is Spanish, from Spain,\nhis native country, to Rome.  He was very fond of calling the church by\nthat name, and other popes have taken it up.  She will allow you to call\nher by it, if you belong to her.\"\n\n\"I shall call her so,\" said I, \"without belonging to her, or asking her\npermission.\"\n\n\"She will allow you to treat her as such, if you belong to her,\" said the\nman in black; \"there is a chapel in Rome, where there is a wondrously\nfair statue--the son of a cardinal--I mean his nephew--once--Well, she\ndid not cut off his head, but slightly boxed his cheek and bade him go.\"\n\n\"I have read all about that in 'Keysler's Travels,'\" said I; \"do you tell\nher that I would not touch her with a pair of tongs, unless to seize her\nnose.\"\n\n\"She is fond of lucre,\" said the man in black; \"but does not grudge a\nfaithful priest a little private perquisite,\" and he took out a very\nhandsome gold repeater.\n\n\"Are you not afraid,\" said I, \"to flash that watch before the eyes of a\npoor tinker in a dingle?\"\n\n\"Not before the eyes of one like you,\" said the man in black.\n\n\"It is getting late,\" said I; \"I care not for perquisites.\"\n\n\"So you will not join us?\" said the man in black.\n\n\"You have had my answer,\" said I.\n\n\"If I belong to Rome,\" said the man in black, \"why should not you?\"\n\n\"I may be a poor tinker,\" said I; \"but I may never have undergone what\nyou have.  You remember, perhaps, the fable of the fox who had lost his\ntail?\"\n\nThe man in black winced, but almost immediately recovering himself, he\nsaid, \"Well, we can do without you, we are sure of winning.\"\n\n\"It is not the part of wise people,\" said I, \"to make sure of the battle\nbefore it is fought: there's the landlord of the public-house, who made\nsure that his cocks would win, yet the cocks lost the main, and the\nlandlord is little better than a bankrupt.\"\n\n\"People very different from the landlord,\" said the man in black, \"both\nin intellect and station, think we shall surely win; there are clever\nmachinators among us who have no doubt of our success.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I will set the landlord aside, and will adduce one who\nwas in every point a very different person from the landlord, both in\nunderstanding and station; he was very fond of laying schemes, and,\nindeed, many of them turned out successful.  His last and darling one,\nhowever, miscarried, notwithstanding that by his calculations he had\npersuaded himself that there was no possibility of its failing--the\nperson that I allude to was old Fraser--\"\n\n\"Who?\" said the man in black, giving a start, and letting his glass fall.\n\n\"Old Fraser, of Lovat,\" said I, \"the prince of all conspirators and\nmachinators; he made sure of placing the Pretender on the throne of these\nrealms.  'I can bring into the field so many men,' said he; 'my son-in-\nlaw Cluny, so many, and likewise my cousin, and my good friend;' then\nspeaking of those on whom the government reckoned for support, he would\nsay, 'So and so are lukewarm, this person is ruled by his wife, who is\nwith us, the clergy are anything but hostile to us, and as for the\nsoldiers and sailors, half are disaffected to King George, and the rest\ncowards.'  Yet when things came to a trial, this person whom he had\ncalculated upon to join the Pretender did not stir from his home, another\njoined the hostile ranks, the presumed cowards turned out heroes, and\nthose whom he thought heroes ran away like lusty fellows at Culloden; in\na word, he found himself utterly mistaken, and in nothing more than in\nhimself; he thought he was a hero, and proved himself nothing more than\nan old fox; he got up a hollow tree, didn't he, just like a fox?\n\n   \"'L'opere sue non furon leonine, ma di volpe.'\"\n\nThe man in black sat silent for a considerable time, and at length\nanswered in rather a faltering voice, \"I was not prepared for this; you\nhave frequently surprised me by your knowledge of things which I should\nnever have expected any person of your appearance to be acquainted with,\nbut that you should be aware of my name is a circumstance utterly\nincomprehensible to me.  I had imagined that no person in England was\nacquainted with it; indeed, I don't see how any person should be, I have\nrevealed it to no one, not being particularly proud of it.  Yes, I\nacknowledge that my name is Fraser, and that I am of the blood of that\nfamily or clan, of which the rector of our college once said, that he was\nfirmly of opinion that every individual member was either rogue or fool.\nI was born at Madrid, of pure, _oime_, Fraser blood.  My parents, at an\nearly age, took me to ---, where they shortly died, not, however, before\nthey had placed me in the service of a cardinal, with whom I continued\nfor some years, and who, when he had no further occasion for me, sent me\nto the college, in the left-hand cloister of which, as you enter, rest\nthe bones of Sir John ---; there, in studying logic and humane letters, I\nlost whatever of humanity I had retained when discarded by the cardinal.\nLet me not, however, forget two points,--I am a Fraser, it is true, but\nnot a Flannagan; I may bear the vilest name of Britain, but not of\nIreland; I was bred up at the English house, and there is at--a house for\nthe education of bogtrotters; I was not bred up at that; beneath the\nlowest gulf, there is one yet lower; whatever my blood may be, it is at\nleast not Irish; whatever my education may have been, I was not bred at\nthe Irish seminary--on those accounts I am thankful--yes, _per dio_!  I\nam thankful.  After some years at college--but why should I tell you my\nhistory? you know it already perfectly well, probably much better than\nmyself.  I am now a missionary priest, labouring in heretic England, like\nParsons and Garnet of old, save and except that, unlike them, I run no\ndanger, for the times are changed.  As I told you before, I shall cleave\nto Rome--I must; _no hay remedio_, as they say at Madrid, and I will do\nmy best to further her holy plans--he! he!--but I confess I begin to\ndoubt of their being successful here--you put me out; old Fraser, of\nLovat!  I have heard my father talk of him; he had a gold-headed cane,\nwith which he once knocked my grandfather down--he was an astute one,\nbut, as you say, mistaken, particularly in himself.  I have read his life\nby Arbuthnot, it is in the library of our college.  Farewell!  I shall\ncome no more to this dingle--to come would be of no utility; I shall go\nand labour elsewhere, though--how you came to know my name, is a fact\nquite inexplicable--farewell! to you both.\"\n\nHe then arose; and without further salutation departed from the dingle,\nin which I never saw him again.  \"How, in the name of wonder, came you to\nknow that man's name?\" said Belle, after he had been gone some time.\n\n\"I, Belle?  I knew nothing of the fellow's name, I assure you.\"\n\n\"But you mentioned his name.\"\n\n\"If I did, it was merely casually, by way of illustration.  I was saying\nhow frequently cunning people were mistaken in their calculations, and I\nadduced the case of old Fraser, of Lovat, as one in point; I brought\nforward his name, because I was well acquainted with his history, from\nhaving compiled and inserted it in a wonderful work, which I edited some\nmonths ago, entitled 'Newgate Lives and Trials,' but without the\nslightest idea that it was the name of him who was sitting with us; he,\nhowever, thought that I was aware of his name.  Belle! Belle! for a long\ntime I doubted the truth of Scripture, owing to certain conceited\nindividuals, but now I begin to believe firmly; what wonderful texts are\nin Scripture, Belle; 'The wicked trembleth where--where--'\"\n\n\"'They were afraid where no fear was; thou hast put them to confusion,\nbecause God hath despised them,'\" said Belle; \"I have frequently read it\nbefore the clergyman in the great house of Long Melford.  But if you did\nnot know the man's name, why let him go away supposing that you did?\"\n\n\"Oh, if he was fool enough to make such a mistake, I was not going to\nundeceive him--no, no!  Let the enemies of old England make the most of\nall their blunders and mistakes, they will have no help from me; but\nenough of the fellow, Belle; let us now have tea, and after that--\"\n\n\"No Armenian,\" said Belle; \"but I want to ask a question: pray are all\npeople of that man's name either rogues or fools?\"\n\n\"It is impossible for me to say, Belle, this person being the only one of\nthe name I have ever personally known.  I suppose there are good and bad,\nclever and foolish, amongst them, as amongst all large bodies of people;\nhowever, after the tribe had been governed for upwards of thirty years,\nby such a person as old Fraser, it were no wonder if the greater part had\nbecome either rogues or fools: he was a ruthless tyrant, Belle, over his\nown people, and by his cruelty and rapaciousness must either have stunned\nthem into an apathy approaching to idiotcy, or made them artful knaves in\ntheir own defence.  The qualities of parents are generally transmitted to\ntheir descendants--the progeny of trained pointers are almost sure to\npoint, even without being taught: if, therefore, all Frasers are either\nrogues or fools, as this person seems to insinuate, it is little to be\nwondered at, their parents or grandparents having been in the training-\nschool of old Fraser!  But enough of the old tyrant and his slaves.\nBelle, prepare tea this moment, or dread my anger.  I have not a gold-\nheaded cane like old Fraser of Lovat, but I have, what some people would\ndread much more, an Armenian rune-stick.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nFresh Arrivals--Pitching the Tent--Certificated Wife--High-flying\nNotions.\n\nOn the following morning, as I was about to leave my tent, I heard the\nvoice of Belle at the door, exclaiming, \"Sleepest thou, or wakest thou?\"\n\"I was never more awake in my life,\" said I, going out.  \"What is the\nmatter?\"  \"He of the horse-shoe,\" said she, \"Jasper, of whom I have heard\nyou talk, is above there on the field with all his people; I went out\nabout a quarter of an hour ago to fill the kettle at the spring, and saw\nthem arriving.\"  \"It is well,\" said I; \"have you any objection to asking\nhim and his wife to breakfast?\"  \"You can do as you please,\" said she; \"I\nhave cups enough, and have no objection to their company.\"  \"We are the\nfirst occupiers of the ground,\" said I, \"and, being so, should consider\nourselves in the light of hosts, and do our best to practise the duties\nof hospitality.\"  \"How fond you are of using that word,\" said Belle; \"if\nyou wish to invite the man and his wife, do so, without more ado;\nremember, however, that I have not cups enough, nor indeed tea enough,\nfor the whole company.\"  Thereupon hurrying up the ascent, I presently\nfound myself outside the dingle.  It was as usual a brilliant morning,\nthe dewy blades of the rye-grass which covered the plain sparkled\nbrightly in the beams of the sun, which had probably been about two hours\nabove the horizon.  A rather numerous body of my ancient friends and\nallies occupied the ground in the vicinity of the mouth of the dingle.\nAbout five yards on the right I perceived Mr. Petulengro busily employed\nin erecting his tent; he held in his hand an iron bar, sharp at the\nbottom, with a kind of arm projecting from the top for the purpose of\nsupporting a kettle or cauldron over the fire, and which is called in the\nRomanian language \"Kekauviskoe saster.\"  With the sharp end of this Mr.\nPetulengro was making holes in the earth, at about twenty inches distant\nfrom each other, into which he inserted certain long rods with a\nconsiderable bend towards the top, which constituted no less than the\ntimber of the tent, and the supporters of the canvas.  Mrs. Petulengro,\nand a female with a crutch in her hand, whom I recognised as Mrs. Chikno,\nsat near him on the ground, whilst two or three children, from six to ten\nyears old, who composed the young family of Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro, were\nplaying about.\n\n\"Here we are, brother,\" said Mr. Petulengro, as he drove the sharp end of\nthe bar into the ground; \"here we are, and plenty of us--Bute dosta\nRomany chals.\"\n\n\"I am glad to see you all,\" said I; \"and particularly you, madam,\" said\nI, making a bow to Mrs. Petulengro; \"and you also, madam,\" taking off my\nhat to Mrs. Chikno.\n\n\"Good-day to you, sir,\" said Mrs. Petulengro; \"you look, as usual,\ncharmingly, and speak so, too; you have not forgot your manners.\"\n\n\"It is not all gold that glitters,\" said Mrs. Chikno.  \"However, good-\nmorrow to you, young rye.\"\n\n\"I do not see Tawno,\" said I, looking around; \"where is he?\"\n\n\"Where, indeed!\" said Mrs. Chikno; \"I don't know; he who countenances him\nin the roving line can best answer.\"\n\n\"He will be here anon,\" said Mr. Petulengro; \"he has merely ridden down a\nby-road to show a farmer a two-year-old colt; she heard me give him\ndirections, but she can't be satisfied.\"\n\n\"I can't indeed,\" said Mrs. Chikno.\n\n\"And why not, sister?\"\n\n\"Because I place no confidence in your words, brother; as I said before,\nyou countenances him.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I know nothing of your private concerns; I am come on an\nerrand.  Isopel Berners, down in the dell there, requests the pleasure of\nMr. and Mrs. Petulengro's company at breakfast.  She will be happy also\nto see you, madam,\" said I, addressing Mrs. Chikno.\n\n\"Is that young female your wife, young man?\" said Mrs. Chikno.\n\n\"My wife?\" said I.\n\n\"Yes, young man; your wife, your lawful certificated wife?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I; \"she is not my wife.\"\n\n\"Then I will not visit with her,\" said Mrs. Chikno; \"I countenance\nnothing in the roving line.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by the roving line?\" I demanded.\n\n\"What do I mean by the roving line?  Why, by it I mean such conduct as is\nnot tatcheno.  When ryes and rawnies live together in dingles, without\nbeing certificated, I call such behaviour being tolerably deep in the\nroving line, everything savouring of which I am determined not to\nsanctify.  I have suffered too much by my own certificated husband's\noutbreaks in that line to afford anything of the kind the slightest\nshadow of countenance.\"\n\n\"It is hard that people may not live in dingles together without being\nsuspected of doing wrong,\" said I.\n\n\"So it is,\" said Mrs. Petulengro, interposing; \"and, to tell you the\ntruth, I am altogether surprised at the illiberality of my sister's\nremarks.  I have often heard say, that it is in good company--and I have\nkept good company in my time--that suspicion is king's evidence of a\nnarrow and uncultivated mind; on which account I am suspicious of nobody,\nnot even of my own husband, whom some people would think I have a right\nto be suspicious of, seeing that on his account I once refused a lord;\nbut ask him whether I am suspicious of him, and whether I seek to keep\nhim close tied to my apron-string; he will tell you nothing of the kind;\nbut that, on the contrary, I always allows him an agreeable latitude,\npermitting him to go where he pleases, and to converse with any one to\nwhose manner of speaking he may take a fancy.  But I have had the\nadvantage of keeping good company, and therefore--\"\n\n\"Meklis,\" said Mrs. Chikno, \"pray drop all that, sister; I believe I have\nkept as good company as yourself; and with respect to that offer with\nwhich you frequently fatigue those who keeps company with you, I believe,\nafter all, it was something in the roving and uncertificated line.\"\n\n\"In whatever line it was,\" said Mrs. Petulengro, \"the offer was a good\none.  The young duke--for he was not only a lord, but a duke too--offered\nto keep me a fine carriage, and to make me his second wife; for it is\ntrue that he had another who was old and stout, though mighty rich, and\nhighly good-natured; so much so, indeed, that the young lord assured me\nthat she would have no manner of objection to the arrangement; more\nespecially if I would consent to live in the same house with her, being\nfond of young and cheerful society.  So you see--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Mrs. Chikno, \"I see, what I before thought, that it was\naltogether in the uncertificated line.\"\n\n\"Meklis,\" said Mrs. Petulengro; \"I use your own word, madam, which is\nRomany: for my own part, I am not fond of using Romany words, unless I\ncan hope to pass them off for French, which I cannot in the present\ncompany.  I heartily wish that there was no such language, and do my best\nto keep it away from my children, lest the frequent use of it should\naltogether confirm them in low and vulgar habits.  I have four children,\nmadam, but--\"\n\n\"I suppose by talking of your four children you wish to check me for\nhaving none,\" said Mrs. Chikno, bursting into tears; \"if I have no\nchildren, sister, it is no fault of mine, it is--but why do I call you\nsister?\" said she, angrily; \"you are no sister of mine, you are a grasni,\na regular mare--a pretty sister, indeed, ashamed of your own language.  I\nremember well that by your high-flying notions you drove your own\nmother--\"\n\n\"We will drop it,\" said Mrs. Petulengro; \"I do not wish to raise my\nvoice, and to make myself ridiculous.  Young gentleman,\" said she, \"pray\npresent my compliments to Miss Isopel Berners, and inform her that I am\nvery sorry that I cannot accept her polite invitation.  I am just\narrived, and have some slight domestic matters to see to--amongst others,\nto wash my children's faces; but that in the course of the forenoon, when\nI have attended to what I have to do, and have dressed myself, I hope to\ndo myself the honour of paying her a regular visit; you will tell her\nthat, with my compliments.  With respect to my husband he can answer for\nhimself, as I, not being of a jealous disposition, never interferes with\nhis matters.\"\n\n\"And tell Miss Berners,\" said Mr. Petulengro, \"that I shall be happy to\nwait upon her in company with my wife as soon as we are regularly\nsettled: at present I have much on my hands, having not only to pitch my\nown tent, but this here jealous woman's, whose husband is absent on my\nbusiness.\"\n\nThereupon I returned to the dingle, and, without saying anything about\nMrs. Chikno's observations, communicated to Isopel the messages of Mr.\nand Mrs. Petulengro; Isopel made no other reply than by replacing in her\ncoffer two additional cups and saucers, which, in expectation of company,\nshe had placed upon the board.  The kettle was by this time boiling.  We\nsat down, and, as we breakfasted, I gave Isopel Berners another lesson in\nthe Armenian language.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nThe Promised Visit--Roman Fashion--Wizard and Witch--Catching at\nWords--The Two Females--Dressing of Hair--The New Roads--Belle's Altered\nAppearance--Herself Again.\n\nAbout mid-day Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro came to the dingle to pay the\npromised visit.  Belle, at the time of their arrival, was in her tent,\nbut I was at the fire-place, engaged in hammering part of the outer-tire,\nor defence, which had come off from one of the wheels of my vehicle.  On\nperceiving them I forthwith went to receive them.  Mr. Petulengro was\ndressed in Roman fashion, with a somewhat smartly-cut sporting-coat, the\nbuttons of which were half-crowns--and a waistcoat, scarlet and black,\nthe buttons of which were spaded half-guineas; his breeches were of a\nstuff half velveteen, half corduroy, the cords exceedingly broad.  He had\nleggings of buff cloth, furred at the bottom; and upon his feet were\nhighlows.  Under his left arm was a long black whalebone riding-whip,\nwith a red lash, and an immense silver knob.  Upon his head was a hat\nwith a high peak, somewhat of the kind which the Spaniards call _calane_,\nso much in favour with the bravos of Seville and Madrid.  Now, when I\nhave added that Mr. Petulengro had on a very fine white holland shirt, I\nthink I have described his array.  Mrs. Petulengro--I beg pardon for not\nhaving spoken of her first--was also arrayed very much in the Roman\nfashion.  Her hair, which was exceedingly black and lustrous, fell in\nbraids on either side of her head.  In her ears were rings, with long\ndrops of gold.  Round her neck was a string of what seemed very much like\nvery large pearls, somewhat tarnished, however, and apparently of\nconsiderable antiquity.  \"Here we are, brother,\" said Mr. Petulengro;\n\"here we are, come to see you--wizard and witch, witch and wizard:--\n\n   \"'There's a chovahanee, and a chovahano,\n   The nav se len is Petulengro.'\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, sir,\" said Mrs. Petulengro; \"you make me ashamed of\nyou with your vulgar ditties.  We are come a visiting now, and everything\nlow should be left behind.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Mr. Petulengro; \"why bring what's low to the dingle, which\nis low enough already?\"\n\n\"What, are you a catcher at words?\" said I.  \"I thought that catching at\nwords had been confined to the pothouse farmers and village witty\nbodies.\"\n\n\"All fools,\" said Mrs. Petulengro, \"catch at words, and very naturally,\nas by so doing they hope to prevent the possibility of rational\nconversation.  Catching at words confined to pothouse farmers, and\nvillage witty bodies!  No, not to Jasper Petulengro.  Listen for an hour\nor two to the discourse of a set they call newspaper editors, and if you\ndon't go out and eat grass, as a dog does when he is sick, I am no female\nwoman.  The young lord whose hand I refused when I took up with wise\nJasper, once brought two of them to my mother's tan, when hankering after\nmy company; they did nothing but carp at each other's words, and a pretty\nhand they made of it.  Ill-favoured dogs they were; and their attempts at\nwhat they called wit almost as unfortunate as their countenances.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"madam, we will drop all catchings and carpings for the\npresent.  Pray take your seat on this stool, whilst I go and announce to\nMiss Isopel Berners your arrival.\"\n\nThereupon I went to Belle's habitation, and informed her that Mr. and\nMrs. Petulengro had paid us a visit of ceremony, and were awaiting her at\nthe fire-place.  \"Pray go and tell them that I am busy,\" said Belle, who\nwas engaged with her needle.  \"I do not feel disposed to take part in any\nsuch nonsense.\"  \"I shall do no such thing,\" said I; \"and I insist upon\nyour coming forthwith, and showing proper courtesy to your visitors.  If\nyou do not, their feelings will be hurt, and you are aware that I cannot\nbear that people's feelings should be outraged.  Come this moment, or--\"\n\"Or what?\" said Belle, half smiling.  \"I was about to say something in\nArmenian,\" said I.  \"Well,\" said Belle, laying down her work, \"I will\ncome.\"  \"Stay,\" said I; \"your hair is hanging about your ears, and your\ndress is in disorder; you had better stay a minute or two to prepare\nyourself to appear before your visitors, who have come in their very best\nattire.\"  \"No,\" said Belle, \"I will make no alteration in my appearance;\nyou told me to come this moment, and you shall be obeyed.\"  So Belle and\nI advanced towards our guests.  As we drew nigh Mr. Petulengro took off\nhis hat, and made a profound obeisance to Belle, whilst Mrs. Petulengro\nrose from the stool, and made a profound curtsey.  Belle, who had flung\nher hair back over her shoulders, returned their salutations by bending\nher head, and after slightly glancing at Mr. Petulengro, fixed her large\nblue eyes full upon his wife.  Both these females were very handsome--but\nhow unlike!  Belle fair, with blue eyes and flaxen hair; Mrs. Petulengro\nwith olive complexion, eyes black, and hair dark--as dark as could be.\nBelle, in demeanour calm and proud; the gypsy graceful, but full of\nmovement and agitation.  And then how different were those two in\nstature!  The head of the Romany rawnie scarcely ascended to the breast\nof Isopel Berners.  I could see that Mrs. Petulengro gazed on Belle with\nunmixed admiration; so did her husband.  \"Well,\" said the latter, \"one\nthing I will say, which is, that there is only one on earth worthy to\nstand up in front of this she, and that is the beauty of the world, as\nfar as man flesh is concerned, Tawno Chikno; what a pity he did not come\ndown!\"\n\n\"Tawno Chikno,\" said Mrs. Petulengro, flaring up; \"a pretty fellow he to\nstand up in front of this gentlewoman, a pity he didn't come, quotha? not\nat all, the fellow is a sneak, afraid of his wife.  He stand up against\nthis rawnie! why, the look she has given me would knock the fellow down.\"\n\n\"It is easier to knock him down with a look than with a fist,\" said Mr.\nPetulengro; \"that is, if the look comes from a woman: not that I am\ndisposed to doubt that this female gentlewoman is able to knock him down\neither one way or the other.  I have heard of her often enough, and have\nseen her once or twice, though not so near as now.  Well, ma'am, my wife\nand I are come to pay our respects to you; we are both glad to find that\nyou have left off keeping company with Flaming Bosville, and have taken\nup with my pal; he is not very handsome, but a better--\"\n\n\"I take up with your pal, as you call him! you had better mind what you\nsay,\" said Isopel Berners, \"I take up with nobody.\"\n\n\"I merely mean taking up your quarters with him,\" said Mr. Petulengro;\n\"and I was only about to say a better fellow-lodger you cannot have, or a\nmore instructive, especially if you have a desire to be inoculated with\ntongues, as he calls them.  I wonder whether you and he have had any\ntongue-work already.\"\n\n\"Have you and your wife anything particular to say? if you have nothing\nbut this kind of conversation I must leave you, as I am going to make a\njourney this afternoon, and should be getting ready.\"\n\n\"You must excuse my husband, madam,\" said Mrs. Petulengro, \"he is not\noverburdened with understanding, and has said but one word of sense since\nhe has been here, which was that we came to pay our respects to you.  We\nhave dressed ourselves in our best Roman way, in order to do honour to\nyou; perhaps you do not like it; if so, I am sorry.  I have no French\nclothes, madam; if I had any, madam, I would have come in them, in order\nto do you more honour.\"\n\n\"I like to see you much better as you are,\" said Belle; \"people should\nkeep to their own fashions, and yours is very pretty.\"\n\n\"I am glad you are pleased to think it so, madam; it has been admired in\nthe great city; it created what they call a sensation; and some of the\ngreat ladies, the court ladies, imitated it, else I should not appear in\nit so often as I am accustomed; for I am not very fond of what is Roman,\nhaving an imagination that what is Roman is ungenteel; in fact, I once\nheard the wife of a rich citizen say that gypsies were vulgar creatures.\nI should have taken her saying very much to heart, but for her improper\npronunciation; she could not pronounce her words, madam, which we\ngypsies, as they call us, usually can, so I thought she was no very high\npurchase.  You are very beautiful, madam, though you are not dressed as I\ncould wish to see you, and your hair is hanging down in sad confusion;\nallow me to assist you in arranging your hair, madam; I will dress it for\nyou in our fashion; I would fain see how your hair would look in our poor\ngypsy fashion; pray allow me, madam?\" and she took Belle by the hand.\n\n\"I really can do no such thing,\" said Belle, withdrawing her hand; \"I\nthank you for coming to see me, but--\"\n\n\"Do allow me to officiate upon your hair, madam,\" said Mrs. Petulengro.\n\"I should esteem your allowing me a great mark of condescension.  You are\nvery beautiful, madam, and I think you doubly so, because you are so\nfair; I have a great esteem for persons with fair complexions and hair; I\nhave a less regard for people with dark hair and complexions, madam.\"\n\n\"Then why did you turn off the lord, and take up with me?\" said Mr.\nPetulengro; \"that same lord was fair enough all about him.\"\n\n\"People do when they are young and silly what they sometimes repent of\nwhen they are of riper years and understandings.  I sometimes think that\nhad I not been something of a simpleton, I might at this time be a great\ncourt lady.  Now, madam,\" said she, again taking Belle by the hand, \"do\noblige me by allowing me to plait your hair a little?\"\n\n\"I have really a good mind to be angry with you,\" said Belle, giving Mrs.\nPetulengro a peculiar glance.\n\n\"Do allow her to arrange your hair,\" said I; \"she means no harm, and\nwishes to do you honour; do oblige her and me too, for I should like to\nsee how your hair would look dressed in her fashion.\"\n\n\"You hear what the young rye says?\" said Mrs. Petulengro.  \"I am sure you\nwill oblige the young rye, if not myself.  Many people would be willing\nto oblige the young rye, if he would but ask them; but he is not in the\nhabit of asking favours.  He has a nose of his own, which he keeps\ntolerably exalted; he does not think small-beer of himself, madam; and\nall the time I have been with him, I never heard him ask a favour before;\ntherefore, madam, I am sure you will oblige him.  My sister Ursula would\nbe very willing to oblige him in many things, but he will not ask for\nanything, except for such a favour as a word, which is a poor favour\nafter all.  I don't mean for her word; perhaps he will some day ask you\nfor your word.  If so--\"\n\n\"Why, here you are, after railing at me for catching at words, catching\nat a word yourself,\" said Mr. Petulengro.\n\n\"Hold your tongue, sir,\" said Mrs. Petulengro.  \"Don't interrupt me in my\ndiscourse; if I caught at a word now, I am not in the habit of doing so.\nI am no conceited body; no newspaper Neddy; no pothouse witty person.  I\nwas about to say, madam, that if the young rye asks you at any time for\nyour word, you will do as you deem convenient; but I am sure you will\noblige him by allowing me to braid your hair.\"\n\n\"I shall not do it to oblige him,\" said Belle; \"the young rye, as you\ncall him, is nothing to me.\"\n\n\"Well, then, to oblige me,\" said Mrs. Petulengro; \"do allow me to become\nyour poor tire-woman.\"\n\n\"It is great nonsense,\" said Belle, reddening; \"however, as you came to\nsee me, and ask the matter as a particular favour to yourself--\"\n\n\"Thank you, madam,\" said Mrs. Petulengro, leading Belle to the stool;\n\"please to sit down here.  Thank you; your hair is very beautiful,\nmadam,\" she continued, as she proceeded to braid Belle's hair; \"so is\nyour countenance.  Should you ever go to the great city, among the grand\nfolks, you would make a sensation, madam.  I have made one myself, who am\ndark; the chi she is kauley, which last word signifies black, which I am\nnot, though rather dark.  There is no colour like white, madam; it's so\nlasting, so genteel.  Gentility will carry the day, madam, even with the\nyoung rye.  He will ask words of the black lass, but beg the word of the\nfair.\"\n\nIn the meantime Mr. Petulengro and myself entered into conversation.  \"Any\nnews stirring, Mr. Petulengro?\" said I.  \"Have you heard anything of the\ngreat religious movements?\"\n\n\"Plenty,\" said Mr. Petulengro; \"all the religious people, more especially\nthe Evangelicals--those that go about distributing tracts--are very angry\nabout the fight between Gentleman Cooper and White-headed Bob, which they\nsay ought not to have been permitted to take place; and then they are\ntrying all they can to prevent the fight between the lion and the dogs,\nwhich they say is a disgrace to a Christian country.  Now I can't say\nthat I have any quarrel with the religious party and the Evangelicals;\nthey are always civil to me and mine, and frequently give us tracts, as\nthey call them, which neither I nor mine can read; but I cannot say that\nI approve of any movements, religious or not, which have in aim to put\ndown all life and manly sport in this here country.\"\n\n\"Anything else?\" said I.\n\n\"People are becoming vastly sharp,\" said Mr. Petulengro; \"and I am told\nthat all the old-fashioned good-tempered constables are going to be set\naside, and a paid body of men to be established, who are not to permit a\ntramper or vagabond on the roads of England;--and talking of roads, puts\nme in mind of a strange story I heard two nights ago, whilst drinking\nsome beer at a public-house in company with my cousin Sylvester.  I had\nasked Tawno to go, but his wife would not let him.  Just opposite me,\nsmoking their pipes, were a couple of men, something like engineers, and\nthey were talking of a wonderful invention which was to make a wonderful\nalteration in England; inasmuch as it would set aside all the old roads,\nwhich in a little time would be ploughed up, and sowed with corn, and\ncause all England to be laid down with iron roads, on which people would\ngo thundering along in vehicles, pushed forward by fire and smoke.  Now,\nbrother, when I heard this, I did not feel very comfortable; for I\nthought to myself, what a queer place such a road would be to pitch one's\ntent upon, and how impossible it would be for one's cattle to find a bite\nof grass upon it; and I thought likewise of the danger to which one's\nfamily would be exposed in being run over and severely scorched by these\nsame flying fiery vehicles; so I made bold to say, that I hoped such an\ninvention would never be countenanced, because it was likely to do a\ngreat deal of harm.  Whereupon, one of the men, giving me a glance, said,\nwithout taking the pipe out of his mouth, that for his part, he sincerely\nhoped that it would take effect; and if it did no other good than\nstopping the rambles of gypsies, and other like scamps, it ought to be\nencouraged.  Well, brother, feeling myself insulted, I put my hand into\nmy pocket, in order to pull out money, intending to challenge him to\nfight for a five-shilling stake, but merely found sixpence, having left\nall my other money at the tent; which sixpence was just sufficient to pay\nfor the beer which Sylvester and myself were drinking, of whom I couldn't\nhope to borrow anything--'poor as Sylvester' being a by-word amongst us.\nSo, not being able to back myself, I held my peace, and let the Gorgio\nhave it all his own way, who, after turning up his nose at me, went on\ndiscoursing about the said invention, saying what a fund of profit it\nwould be to those who knew how to make use of it, and should have the\nlaying down of the new roads, and the shoeing of England with iron.  And\nafter he had said this, and much more of the same kind, which I cannot\nremember, he and his companion got up and walked away; and presently I\nand Sylvester got up and walked to our camp; and there I lay down in my\ntent by the side of my wife, where I had an ugly dream of having camped\nupon an iron road; my tent being overturned by a flying vehicle; my\nwife's leg injured; and all my affairs put into great confusion.\"\n\n\"Now, madam,\" said Mrs. Petulengro, \"I have braided your hair in our\nfashion: you look very beautiful, madam; more beautiful, if possible,\nthan before.\"  Belle now rose, and came forward with her tire-woman.  Mr.\nPetulengro was loud in his applause, but I said nothing, for I did not\nthink Belle was improved in appearance by having submitted to the\nministry of Mrs. Petulengro's hand.  Nature never intended Belle to\nappear as a gypsy; she had made her too proud and serious.  A more proper\npart for her was that of a heroine, a queenly heroine,--that of Theresa\nof Hungary, for example; or, better still, that of Brynhilda the\nValkyrie, the beloved of Sigurd, the serpent-killer, who incurred the\ncurse of Odin, because, in the tumult of spears, she sided with the young\nking, and doomed the old warrior to die, to whom Odin had promised\nvictory.\n\nBelle looked at me for a moment in silence; then turning to Mrs.\nPetulengro, she said, \"You have had your will with me; are you\nsatisfied?\"  \"Quite so, madam,\" said Mrs. Petulengro, \"and I hope you\nwill be so too, as soon as you have looked in the glass.\"  \"I have looked\nin one already,\" said Belle; \"and the glass does not flatter.\"  \"You mean\nthe face of the young rye,\" said Mrs. Petulengro; \"never mind him, madam;\nthe young rye, though he knows a thing or two, is not a university, nor a\nperson of universal wisdom.  I assure you, that you never looked so well\nbefore; and I hope that, from this moment, you will wear your hair in\nthis way.\"  \"And who is to braid it in this way?\" said Belle, smiling.\n\"I, madam,\" said Mrs. Petulengro; \"I will braid it for you every morning,\nif you will but be persuaded to join us.  Do so, madam, and I think, if\nyou did, the young rye would do so too.\"  \"The young rye is nothing to\nme, nor I to him,\" said Belle; \"we have stayed some time together; but\nour paths will soon be apart.  Now, farewell, for I am about to take a\njourney.\"  \"And you will go out with your hair as I have braided it,\"\nsaid Mrs. Petulengro; \"if you do, everybody will be in love with you.\"\n\"No,\" said Belle; \"hitherto I have allowed you to do what you please, but\nhenceforth I shall have my own way.  Come, come,\" said she, observing\nthat the gypsy was about to speak, \"we have had enough of nonsense;\nwhenever I leave this hollow, it will be wearing my hair in my own\nfashion.\"  \"Come, wife,\" said Mr. Petulengro; \"we will no longer intrude\nupon the rye and rawnie; there is such a thing as being troublesome.\"\nThereupon Mr. Petulengro and his wife took their leave, with many\nsalutations.  \"Then you are going?\" said I, when Belle and I were left\nalone.  \"Yes,\" said Belle; \"I am going on a journey; my affairs compel\nme.\"  \"But you will return again?\" said I.  \"Yes,\" said Belle, \"I shall\nreturn once more.\"  \"Once more,\" said I; \"what do you mean by once more?\nThe Petulengros will soon be gone, and will you abandon me in this\nplace?\"  \"You were alone here,\" said Belle, \"before I came, and I\nsuppose, found it agreeable, or you would not have stayed in it.\"  \"Yes,\"\nsaid I, \"that was before I knew you; but having lived with you here, I\nshould be very loth to live here without you.\"  \"Indeed,\" said Belle; \"I\ndid not know that I was of so much consequence to you.  Well, the day is\nwearing away--I must go and harness Traveller to the cart.\"  \"I will do\nthat,\" said I, \"or anything else you may wish me.  Go and prepare\nyourself; I will see after Traveller and the cart.\"  Belle departed to\nher tent, and I set about performing the task I had undertaken.  In about\nhalf-an-hour Belle again made her appearance--she was dressed neatly and\nplainly.  Her hair was no longer in the Roman fashion, in which Pakomovna\nhad plaited it, but was secured by a comb; she held a bonnet in her hand.\n\"Is there anything else I can do for you?\" I demanded.  \"There are two or\nthree bundles by my tent, which you can put into the cart,\" said Belle.  I\nput the bundles into the cart, and then led Traveller and the cart up the\nwinding path to the mouth of the dingle, near which was Mr. Petulengro's\nencampment.  Belle followed.  At the top, I delivered the reins into her\nhands; we looked at each other stedfastly for some time.  Belle then\ndeparted, and I returned to the dingle, where, seating myself on my\nstone, I remained for upwards of an hour in thought.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nThe Festival--The Gypsy Song--Piramus of Rome--The Scotchman--Gypsy\nNames.\n\nOn the following day there was much feasting amongst the Romany chals of\nMr. Petulengro's party.  Throughout the forenoon the Romany chies did\nscarcely anything but cook flesh, and the flesh which they cooked was\nswine's flesh.  About two o'clock, the chals dividing themselves into\nvarious parties, sat down and partook of the fare, which was partly\nroasted, partly sodden.  I dined that day with Mr. Petulengro and his\nwife and family, Ursula, Mr. and Mrs. Chikno, and Sylvester and his two\nchildren.  Sylvester, it will be as well to say, was a widower, and had\nconsequently no one to cook his victuals for him, supposing he had any,\nwhich was not always the case, Sylvester's affairs being seldom in a\nprosperous state.  He was noted for his bad success in trafficking,\nnotwithstanding the many hints which he received from Jasper, under whose\nprotection he had placed himself, even as Tawno Chikno had done, who\nhimself, as the reader has heard on a former occasion, was anything but a\nwealthy subject, though he was at all times better off than Sylvester,\nthe Lazarus of the Romany tribe.\n\nAll our party ate with a good appetite, except myself, who, feeling\nrather melancholy that day, had little desire to eat.  I did not, like\nthe others, partake of the pork, but got my dinner entirely off the body\nof a squirrel which had been shot the day before by a chal of the name of\nPiramus, who, besides being a good shot, was celebrated for his skill in\nplaying on the fiddle.  During the dinner a horn filled with ale passed\nfrequently around; I drank of it more than once, and felt inspirited by\nthe draughts.  The repast concluded, Sylvester and his children departed\nto their tent, and Mr. Petulengro, Tawno, and myself, getting up, went\nand lay down under a shady hedge, where Mr. Petulengro, lighting his\npipe, began to smoke, and where Tawno presently fell asleep.  I was about\nto fall asleep also, when I heard the sound of music and song.  Piramus\nwas playing on the fiddle, whilst Mrs. Chikno, who had a voice of her\nown, was singing in tones sharp enough, but of great power, a gypsy\nsong:--\n\n\n\nPOISONING THE PORKER\nBY MRS. CHIKNO\n\n\n   To mande shoon ye Romany chals\n   Who besh in the pus about the yag,\n   I'll pen how we drab the baulo,\n   I'll pen how we drab the baulo.\n\n   We jaws to the drab-engro ker,\n   Trin horsworth there of drab we lels,\n   And when to the swety back we wels\n   We pens we'll drab the baulo,\n   We'll have a drab at a baulo.\n\n   And then we kairs the drab opre,\n   And then we jaws to the farming ker,\n   To mang a beti habben,\n   A beti poggado habben.\n\n   A rinkeno baulo there we dick,\n   And then we pens in Romano jib;\n   Wust lis odoi opre ye chick,\n   And the baulo he will lel lis,\n   The baulo he will lel lis.\n\n   Coliko, coliko saulo we\n   Apopli to the farming ker\n   Will wel and mang him mullo,\n   Will wel and mang his truppo.\n\n   And so we kairs, and so we kairs;\n   The baulo in the rarde mers;\n   We mang him on the saulo,\n   And rig to the tan the baulo.\n\n   And then we toves the wendror well\n   Till sore the wendror iuziou se,\n   Till kekkeno drab's adrey lis,\n   Till drab there's kek adrey lis.\n\n   And then his truppo well we hatch,\n   Kin levinor at the kitchema,\n   And have a kosko habben,\n   A kosko Romano habben.\n\n   The boshom engro kils, he kils,\n   The tawnie juva gils, she gils\n   A puro Romano gillie,\n   Now shoon the Romano gillie.\n\nWhich song I had translated in the following manner, in my younger days,\nfor a lady's album:\n\n   Listen to me ye Roman lads, who are seated in the straw about the\n   fire, and I will tell how we poison the porker, I will tell how we\n   poison the porker.\n\n   We go to the house of the poison-monger, where we buy three pennies'\n   worth of bane, and when we return to our people we say, we will poison\n   the porker; we will try and poison the porker.\n\n   We then make up the poison, and then we take our way to the house of\n   the farmer, as if to beg a bit of victuals, a little broken victuals.\n\n   We see a jolly porker, and then we say in Roman language, \"Fling the\n   bane yonder amongst the dirt, and the porker soon will find it, the\n   porker soon will find it.\"\n\n   Early on the morrow, we will return to the farm-house, and beg the\n   dead porker, the body of the dead porker.\n\n   And so we do, even so we do; the porker dieth during the night; on the\n   morrow we beg the porker, and carry to the tent the porker.\n\n   And then we wash the inside well, till all the inside is perfectly\n   clean, till there's no bane within it, not a poison grain within it.\n\n   And then we roast the body well, send for ale to the alehouse, and\n   have a merry banquet, a merry Roman banquet.\n\n   The fellow with the fiddle plays, he plays; the little lassie sings,\n   she sings an ancient Roman ditty; now hear the Roman ditty.\n\n\n\nSONG OF THE BROKEN CHASTITY\nBY URSULA\n\n\n   Penn'd the Romany chi ke laki dye\n   \"Miry dearie dye mi shom cambri!\"\n   \"And coin kerdo tute cambri,\n   Miry dearie chi, miry Romany chi?\"\n   \"O miry dye a boro rye,\n   A bovalo rye, a gorgiko rye,\n   Sos kistur pre a pellengo grye,\n   'Twas yov sos kerdo man cambri.\"\n   \"Tu tawnie vassavie lubbeny,\n   Tu chal from miry tan abri;\n   Had a Romany chal kair'd tute cambri,\n   Then I had penn'd ke tute chie,\n   But tu shan a vassavie lubbeny\n   With gorgikie rat to be cambri.\"\n\n\"There's some kernel in those songs, brother,\" said Mr. Petulengro, when\nthe songs and music were over.\n\n\"Yes,\" said I; \"they are certainly very remarkable songs.  I say, Jasper,\nI hope you have not been drabbing baulor lately.\"\n\n\"And suppose we have, brother, what then?\"\n\n\"Why, it is a very dangerous practice, to say nothing of the wickedness\nof it.\"\n\n\"Necessity has no law, brother.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said I; \"I have always said so, but you are not\nnecessitous, and should not drab baulor.\"\n\n\"And who told you we had been drabbing baulor?\"\n\n\"Why, you have had a banquet of pork, and after the banquet, Mrs. Chikno\nsang a song about drabbing baulor, so I naturally thought you might have\nlately been engaged in such a thing.\"\n\n\"Brother, you occasionally utter a word or two of common sense.  It was\nnatural for you to suppose, after seeing that dinner of pork, and hearing\nthat song, that we had been drabbing baulor; I will now tell you that we\nhave not been doing so.  What have you to say to that?\"\n\n\"That I am very glad of it.\"\n\n\"Had you tasted that pork, brother, you would have found that it was\nsweet and tasty, which balluva that is drabbed can hardly be expected to\nbe.  We have no reason to drab baulor at present, we have money and\ncredit; but necessity has no law.  Our forefathers occasionally drabbed\nbaulor; some of our people may still do such a thing, but only from\ncompulsion.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said I; \"and at your merry meetings you sing songs upon the\ncompulsatory deeds of your people, alias, their villainous actions; and,\nafter all, what would the stirring poetry of any nation be, but for its\ncompulsatory deeds?  Look at the poetry of Scotland, the heroic part,\nfounded almost entirely on the villainous deeds of the Scotch nation; cow-\nstealing, for example, which is very little better than drabbing baulor;\nwhilst the softer part is mostly about the slips of its females among the\nbroom, so that no upholder of Scotch poetry could censure Ursula's song\nas indelicate, even if he understood it.  What do you think, Jasper?\"\n\n\"I think, brother, as I before said, that occasionally you utter a word\nof common sense; you were talking of the Scotch, brother; what do you\nthink of a Scotchman finding fault with Romany!\"\n\n\"A Scotchman finding fault with Romany, Jasper!  Oh dear, but you joke,\nthe thing could never be.\"\n\n\"Yes, and at Piramus's fiddle; what do you think of a Scotchman turning\nup his nose at Piramus's fiddle?\"\n\n\"A Scotchman turning up his nose at Piramus's fiddle! nonsense, Jasper.\"\n\n\"Do you know what I most dislike, brother?\"\n\n\"I do not, unless it be the constable, Jasper.\"\n\n\"It is not the constable; it's a beggar on horseback, brother.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by a beggar on horseback?\"\n\n\"Why, a scamp, brother, raised above his proper place, who takes every\nopportunity of giving himself fine airs.  About a week ago, my people and\nmyself camped on a green by a plantation in the neighbourhood of a great\nhouse.  In the evening we were making merry, the girls were dancing,\nwhile Piramus was playing on the fiddle a tune of his own composing, to\nwhich he has given his own name, Piramus of Rome, and which is much\ncelebrated amongst our people, and from which I have been told that one\nof the grand gorgio composers, who once heard it, has taken several\nhints.  So, as we were making merry, a great many grand people, lords and\nladies, I believe, came from the great house, and looked on, as the girls\ndanced to the tune of Piramus of Rome, and seemed much pleased; and when\nthe girls had left off dancing, and Piramus playing, the ladies wanted to\nhave their fortunes told; so I bade Mikailia Chikno, who can tell a\nfortune when she pleases better than any one else, tell them a fortune,\nand she, being in a good mind, told them a fortune which pleased them\nvery much.  So, after they had heard their fortunes, one of them asked if\nany of our women could sing; and I told them several could, more\nparticularly Leviathan--you know Leviathan, she is not here now, but some\nmiles distant, she is our best singer, Ursula coming next.  So the lady\nsaid she should like to hear Leviathan sing, whereupon Leviathan sang the\nGudlo pesham, and Piramus played the tune of the same name, which as you\nknow, means the honeycomb, the song and the tune being well entitled to\nthe name, being wonderfully sweet.  Well, everybody present seemed mighty\nwell pleased with the song and music, with the exception of one person, a\ncarroty-haired Scotch body; how he came there I don't know, but there he\nwas; and, coming forward, he began in Scotch as broad as a barn-door to\nfind fault with the music and the song, saying, that he had never heard\nviler stuff than either.  Well, brother, out of consideration for the\ncivil gentry with whom the fellow had come, I held my peace for a long\ntime, and in order to get the subject changed, I said to Mikailia in\nRomany, You have told the ladies their fortunes, now tell the gentlemen\ntheirs, quick, quick,--pen lende dukkerin.  Well, brother, the Scotchman,\nI suppose, thinking I was speaking ill of him, fell into a greater\npassion than before, and catching hold of the word dukkerin--'Dukkerin,'\nsaid he, 'what's dukkerin?'  'Dukkerin,' said I, 'is fortune, a man or\nwoman's destiny; don't you like the word?'  'Word! d'ye ca' that a word?\na bonnie word,' said he.  'Perhaps, you'll tell us what it is in Scotch,'\nsaid I, 'in order that we may improve our language by a Scotch word; a\npal of mine has told me that we have taken a great many words from\nforeign lingos.'  'Why, then, if that be the case, fellow, I will tell\nyou; it is e'en \"spaeing,\"' said he, very seriously.  'Well, then,' said\nI, 'I'll keep my own word, which is much the prettiest--spaeing! spaeing!\nwhy, I should be ashamed to make use of the word, it sounds so much like\na certain other word;' and then I made a face as if I were unwell.\n'Perhaps it's Scotch also for that?'  'What do ye mean by speaking in\nthat guise to a gentleman?' said he; 'you insolent vagabond, without a\nname or a country.'  'There you are mistaken,' said I; 'my country is\nEgypt, but we 'Gyptians, like you Scotch, are rather fond of travelling;\nand as for name--my name is Jasper Petulengro, perhaps you have a better;\nwhat is it?'  'Sandy Macraw.'  At that, brother, the gentlemen burst into\na roar of laughter, and all the ladies tittered.\"\n\n\"You were rather severe on the Scotchman, Jasper.\"\n\n\"Not at all, brother, and suppose I were, he began first; I am the\ncivilest man in the world, and never interfere with anybody, who lets me\nand mine alone.  He finds fault with Romany, forsooth! why, L-d A'mighty,\nwhat's Scotch?  He doesn't like our songs; what are his own?  I\nunderstand them as little as he mine; I have heard one or two of them,\nand pretty rubbish they seemed.  But the best of the joke is, the\nfellow's finding fault with Piramus's fiddle--a chap from the land of\nbagpipes finding fault with Piramus's fiddle!  Why, I'll back that fiddle\nagainst all the bagpipes in Scotland, and Piramus against all the\nbagpipers; for though Piramus weighs but ten stone, he shall flog a\nScotchman of twenty.\"\n\n\"Scotchmen are never so fat as that,\" said I, \"unless indeed, they have\nbeen a long time pensioners of England.  I say, Jasper, what remarkable\nnames your people have!\"\n\n\"And what pretty names, brother; there's my own, for example, Jasper;\nthen there's Ambrose and Sylvester; then there's Culvato, which signifies\nClaude; then there's Piramus--that's a nice name, brother.\"\n\n\"Then there's your wife's name, Pakomovna; then there's Ursula and\nMorella.\"\n\n\"Then, brother, there's Ercilla.\"\n\n\"Ercilla! the name of the great poet of Spain, how wonderful; then\nLeviathan.\"\n\n\"The name of a ship, brother; Leviathan was named after a ship, so don't\nmake a wonder out of her.  But there's Sanpriel and Synfye.\"\n\n\"Ay, and Clementina and Lavinia, Camillia and Lydia, Curlanda and\nOrlanda; wherever did they get those names?\"\n\n\"Where did my wife get her necklace, brother?\"\n\n\"She knows best, Jasper.  I hope--\"\n\n\"Come, no hoping!  She got it from her grandmother, who died at the age\nof a hundred and three, and sleeps in Coggeshall churchyard.  She got it\nfrom her mother, who also died very old, and who could give no other\naccount of it than that it had been in the family time out of mind.\"\n\n\"Whence could they have got it?\"\n\n\"Why, perhaps where they got their names, brother.  A gentleman, who had\ntravelled much, once told me that he had seen the sister of it about the\nneck of an Indian queen.\"\n\n\"Some of your names, Jasper, appear to be church names; your own, for\nexample, and Ambrose, and Sylvester; perhaps you got them from the\nPapists, in the times of Popery; but where did you get such a name as\nPiramus, a name of Grecian romance?  Then some of them appear to be\nSlavonian; for example, Mikailia and Pakomovna.  I don't know much of\nSlavonian; but--\"\n\n\"What is Slavonian, brother?\"\n\n\"The family name of certain nations, the principal of which is the\nRussian, and from which the word slave is originally derived.  You have\nheard of the Russians, Jasper?\"\n\n\"Yes, brother; and seen some.  I saw their crallis at the time of the\npeace; he was not a bad-looking man for a Russian.\"\n\n\"By the bye, Jasper, I'm half inclined to think that crallis is a Slavish\nword.  I saw something like it in a lil called 'Voltaire's Life of\nCharles.'  How you should have come by such names and words is to me\nincomprehensible.\"\n\n\"You seem posed, brother.\"\n\n\"I really know very little about you, Jasper.\"\n\n\"Very little indeed, brother.  We know very little about ourselves; and\nyou know nothing, save what we have told you; and we have now and then\ntold you things about us which are not exactly true, simply to make a\nfool of you, brother.  You will say that was wrong; perhaps it was.  Well,\nSunday will be here in a day or two, when we will go to church, where\npossibly we shall hear a sermon on the disastrous consequences of lying.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nThe Church--The Aristocratical Pew--Days of Yore--The Clergyman--\"In What\nWould a Man be Profited?\"\n\nWhen two days had passed, Sunday came; I breakfasted by myself in the\nsolitary dingle; and then, having set things a little to rights, I\nascended to Mr. Petulengro's encampment.  I could hear church-bells\nringing around in the distance, appearing to say, \"Come to church, come\nto church,\" as clearly as it was possible for church-bells to say.  I\nfound Mr. Petulengro seated by the door of his tent, smoking his pipe, in\nrather an ungenteel undress.  \"Well, Jasper,\" said I, \"are you ready to\ngo to church? for if you are, I am ready to accompany you.\"  \"I am not\nready, brother,\" said Mr. Petulengro, \"nor is my wife; the church, too,\nto which we shall go is three miles off; so it is of no use to think of\ngoing there this morning, as the service would be three-quarters over\nbefore we got there; if, however, you are disposed to go in the\nafternoon, we are your people.\"  Thereupon I returned to my dingle, where\nI passed several hours in conning the Welsh Bible, which the preacher,\nPeter Williams, had given me.\n\nAt last I gave over reading, took a slight refreshment, and was about to\nemerge from the dingle, when I heard the voice of Mr. Petulengro calling\nme.  I went up again to the encampment, where I found Mr. Petulengro, his\nwife, and Tawno Chikno, ready to proceed to church.  Mr. and Mrs.\nPetulengro were dressed in Roman fashion, though not in the full-blown\nmanner in which they had paid their visit to Isopel and myself.  Tawno\nhad on a clean white slop, with a nearly new black beaver, with very\nbroad rims, and the nap exceedingly long.  As for myself, I was dressed\nin much the same manner as that in which I departed from London, having\non, in honour of the day, a shirt perfectly clean, having washed one on\npurpose for the occasion, with my own hands, the day before, in the pond\nof tepid water in which the newts and defts were in the habit of taking\ntheir pleasure.  We proceeded for upwards of a mile, by footpaths through\nmeadows and corn-fields; we crossed various stiles; at last, passing over\none, we found ourselves in a road, wending along which for a considerable\ndistance, we at last came in sight of a church, the bells of which had\nbeen tolling distinctly in our ears for some time; before, however, we\nreached the church-yard, the bells had ceased their melody.  It was\nsurrounded by lofty beech-trees of brilliant green foliage.  We entered\nthe gate, Mrs. Petulengro leading the way, and proceeded to a small door\nnear the east end of the church.  As we advanced, the sound of singing\nwithin the church rose upon our ears.  Arrived at the small door, Mrs.\nPetulengro opened it and entered, followed by Tawno Chikno.  I myself\nwent last of all, following Mr. Petulengro, who, before I entered, turned\nround, and, with a significant nod, advised me to take care how I\nbehaved.  The part of the church which we had entered was the chancel; on\none side stood a number of venerable old men--probably the neighbouring\npoor--and on the other a number of poor girls belonging to the village\nschool, dressed in white gowns and straw bonnets, whom two elegant but\nsimply dressed young women were superintending.  Every voice seemed to be\nunited in singing a certain anthem, which, notwithstanding it was written\nneither by Tate nor Brady, contains some of the sublimest words which\nwere ever put together, not the worst of which are those which burst on\nour ears as we entered:\n\n   \"Every eye shall now behold Him,\n      Robed in dreadful majesty;\n   Those who set at nought and sold Him,\n      Pierced and nailed Him to the tree,\n         Deeply wailing,\n      Shall the true Messiah see.\"\n\nStill following Mrs. Petulengro, we proceeded down the chancel and along\nthe aisle; notwithstanding the singing, I could distinctly hear as we\npassed many a voice whispering, \"Here come the gypsies! here come the\ngypsies!\"  I felt rather embarrassed, with a somewhat awkward doubt as to\nwhere we were to sit; none of the occupiers of the pews, who appeared to\nconsist almost entirely of farmers, with their wives, sons, and\ndaughters, opened a door to admit us.  Mrs. Petulengro, however, appeared\nto feel not the least embarrassment, but tripped along the aisle with the\ngreatest nonchalance.  We passed under the pulpit, in which stood the\nclergyman in his white surplice, and reached the middle of the church,\nwhere we were confronted by the sexton dressed in long blue coat, and\nholding in his hand a wand.  This functionary motioned towards the lower\nend of the church, where were certain benches, partly occupied by poor\npeople and boys.  Mrs. Petulengro, however, with a toss of her head,\ndirected her course to a magnificent pew, which was unoccupied, which she\nopened and entered, followed closely by Tawno Chikno, Mr. Petulengro, and\nmyself.  The sexton did not appear by any means to approve of the\narrangement, and as I stood next the door, laid his finger on my arm, as\nif to intimate that myself and companions must quit our aristocratical\nlocation.  I said nothing, but directed my eyes to the clergyman, who\nuttered a short and expressive cough; the sexton looked at him for a\nmoment, and then, bowing his head, closed the door--in a moment more the\nmusic ceased.  I took up a prayer-book, on which was engraved an earl's\ncoronet.  The clergyman uttered, \"I will arise, and go to my father.\"\nEngland's sublime liturgy had commenced.\n\nOh, what feelings came over me on finding myself again in an edifice\ndevoted to the religion of my country!  I had not been in such a place I\ncannot tell for how long--certainly not for years; and now I had found my\nway there again, it appeared as if I had fallen asleep in the pew of the\nold church of pretty D---.  I had occasionally done so when a child, and\nhad suddenly woke up.  Yes, surely I had been asleep and had woke up; but\nno! alas, no!  I had not been asleep--at least not in the old church--if\nI had been asleep I had been walking in my sleep, struggling, striving,\nlearning, and unlearning in my sleep.  Years had rolled away whilst I had\nbeen asleep--ripe fruit had fallen, green fruit had come on whilst I had\nbeen asleep--how circumstances had altered, and above all myself, whilst\nI had been asleep.  No, I had not been asleep in the old church!  I was\nin a pew, it is true, but not the pew of black leather, in which I\nsometimes fell asleep in days of yore, but in a strange pew; and then my\ncompanions, they were no longer those of days of yore.  I was no longer\nwith my respectable father and mother, and my dear brother, but with the\ngypsy cral and his wife, and the gigantic Tawno, the Antinous of the\ndusky people.  And what was I myself?  No longer an innocent child, but a\nmoody man, bearing in my face, as I knew well, the marks of my strivings\nand strugglings, of what I had learnt and unlearnt; nevertheless, the\ngeneral aspect of things brought to my mind what I had felt and seen of\nyore.  There was difference enough, it is true, but still there was a\nsimilarity--at least I thought so--the church, the clergyman, and the\nclerk, differing in many respects from those of pretty D---, put me\nstrangely in mind of them; and then the words!--by the bye, was it not\nthe magic of the words which brought the dear enchanting past so\npowerfully before the mind of Lavengro? for the words were the same\nsonorous words of high import which had first made an impression on his\nchildish ear in the old church of pretty D---.\n\nThe liturgy was now over, during the reading of which my companions\nbehaved in a most unexceptionable manner, sitting down and rising up when\nother people sat down and rose, and holding in their hands prayer-books\nwhich they found in the pew, into which they stared intently, though I\nobserved that, with the exception of Mrs. Petulengro, who knew how to\nread a little, they held the books by the top, and not the bottom, as is\nthe usual way.  The clergyman now ascended the pulpit, arrayed in his\nblack gown.  The congregation composed themselves to attention, as did\nalso my companions, who fixed their eyes upon the clergyman with a\ncertain strange immovable stare, which I believe to be peculiar to their\nrace.  The clergyman gave out his text, and began to preach.  He was a\ntall, gentlemanly man, seemingly between fifty and sixty, with greyish\nhair; his features were very handsome, but with a somewhat melancholy\ncast: the tones of his voice were rich and noble, but also with somewhat\nof melancholy in them.  The text which he gave out was the following one,\n\"In what would a man be profited, provided he gained the whole world, and\nlost his own soul?\"\n\nAnd on this text the clergyman preached long and well: he did not read\nhis sermon, but spoke it extempore; his doing so rather surprised and\noffended me at first; I was not used to such a style of preaching in a\nchurch devoted to the religion of my country.  I compared it within my\nmind with the style of preaching used by the high-church rector in the\nold church of pretty D---, and I thought to myself it was very different,\nand being very different I did not like it, and I thought to myself how\nscandalized the people of D--- would have been had they heard it, and I\nfigured to myself how indignant the high-church clerk would have been had\nany clergyman got up in the church of D--- and preached in such a manner.\nDid it not savour strongly of dissent, methodism, and similar low stuff?\nSurely it did; why, the Methodist I had heard preach on the heath above\nthe old city, preached in the same manner--at least he preached\nextempore; ay, and something like the present clergyman; for the\nMethodist spoke very zealously and with great feeling, and so did the\npresent clergyman; so I, of course, felt rather offended with the\nclergyman for speaking with zeal and feeling.  However, long before the\nsermon was over I forgot the offence which I had taken, and listened to\nthe sermon with much admiration, for the eloquence and powerful reasoning\nwith which it abounded.\n\nOh, how eloquent he was, when he talked of the inestimable value of a\nman's soul, which he said endured for ever, whilst his body, as every one\nknew, lasted at most for a very contemptible period of time; and how\nforcibly he reasoned on the folly of a man, who, for the sake of gaining\nthe whole world--a thing, he said, which provided he gained he could only\npossess for a part of the time, during which his perishable body\nexisted--should lose his soul, that is, cause that precious deathless\nportion of him to suffer indescribable misery time without end.\n\nThere was one part of his sermon which struck me in a very particular\nmanner: he said, \"That there were some people who gained something in\nreturn for their souls; if they did not get the whole world, they got a\npart of it--lands, wealth, honour, or renown; mere trifles, he allowed,\nin comparison with the value of a man's soul, which is destined either to\nenjoy delight, or suffer tribulation time without end; but which, in the\neyes of the worldly, had a certain value, and which afforded a certain\npleasure and satisfaction.  But there were also others who lost their\nsouls, and got nothing for them--neither lands, wealth, renown, nor\nconsideration, who were poor outcasts, and despised by everybody.  My\nfriends,\" he added, \"if the man is a fool who barters his soul for the\nwhole world, what a fool he must be who barters his soul for nothing.\"\n\nThe eyes of the clergyman, as he uttered these words, wandered around the\nwhole congregation; and when he had concluded them, the eyes of the whole\ncongregation were turned upon my companions and myself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nReturn from Church--The Cuckoo and Gypsy--Spiritual Discourse.\n\nThe service over, my companions and myself returned towards the\nencampment, by the way we came.  Some of the humble part of the\ncongregation laughed and joked at us as we passed.  Mr. Petulengro and\nhis wife, however, returned their laughs and jokes with interest.  As for\nTawno and myself, we said nothing: Tawno, like most handsome fellows,\nhaving very little to say for himself at any time; and myself, though not\nhandsome, not being particularly skilful at repartee.  Some boys followed\nus for a considerable time, making all kinds of observations about\ngypsies; but as we walked at a great pace, we gradually left them behind,\nand at last lost sight of them.  Mrs. Petulengro and Tawno Chikno walked\ntogether, even as they had come; whilst Mr. Petulengro and myself\nfollowed at a little distance.\n\n\"That was a very fine preacher we heard,\" said I to Mr. Petulengro, after\nwe had crossed the stile into the fields.\n\n\"Very fine indeed, brother,\" said Mr. Petulengro; \"he is talked of, far\nand wide, for his sermons; folks say that there is scarcely another like\nhim in the whole of England.\"\n\n\"He looks rather melancholy, Jasper.\"\n\n\"He lost his wife several years ago, who, they say, was one of the most\nbeautiful women ever seen.  They say that it was grief for her loss that\nmade him come out mighty strong as a preacher; for, though he was a\nclergyman, he was never heard of in the pulpit before he lost his wife;\nsince then, the whole country has rung with the preaching of the\nclergyman of M--- as they call him.  Those two nice young gentlewomen,\nwhom you saw with the female childer, are his daughters.\"\n\n\"You seem to know all about him, Jasper.  Did you ever hear him preach\nbefore?\"\n\n\"Never, brother; but he has frequently been to our tent, and his\ndaughters too, and given us tracts; for he is one of the people they call\nEvangelicals, who give folks tracts which they cannot read.\"\n\n\"You should learn to read, Jasper.\"\n\n\"We have no time, brother.\"\n\n\"Are you not frequently idle?\"\n\n\"Never, brother; when we are not engaged in our traffic, we are engaged\nin taking our relaxation: so we have no time to learn.\"\n\n\"You really should make an effort.  If you were disposed to learn to\nread, I would endeavour to assist you.  You would be all the better for\nknowing how to read.\"\n\n\"In what way, brother?\"\n\n\"Why, you could read the Scriptures, and, by so doing, learn your duty\ntowards your fellow-creatures.\"\n\n\"We know that already, brother; the constables and justices have\ncontrived to knock that tolerably into our heads.\"\n\n\"Yet you frequently break the laws.\"\n\n\"So, I believe, do now and then those who know how to read, brother.\"\n\n\"Very true, Jasper; but you really ought to learn to read, as, by so\ndoing, you might learn your duty towards yourselves: and your chief duty\nis to take care of your own souls; did not the preacher say, 'In what is\na man profited, provided he gain the whole world?'\"\n\n\"We have not much of the world, brother.\"\n\n\"Very little indeed, Jasper.  Did you not observe how the eyes of the\nwhole congregation were turned towards our pew, when the preacher said,\n'There are some people who lose their souls, and get nothing in exchange;\nwho are outcast, despised, and miserable?'  Now was not what he said\nquite applicable to the gypsies?\"\n\n\"We are not miserable, brother.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you ought to be, Jasper.  Have you an inch of ground of your\nown?  Are you of the least use?  Are you not spoken ill of by everybody?\nWhat's a gypsy?\"\n\n\"What's the bird noising yonder, brother?\"\n\n\"The bird! oh, that's the cuckoo tolling; but what has the cuckoo to do\nwith the matter?\"\n\n\"We'll see, brother; what's the cuckoo?\"\n\n\"What is it? you know as much about it as myself, Jasper.\"\n\n\"Isn't it a kind of roguish, chaffing bird, brother?\"\n\n\"I believe it is, Jasper.\"\n\n\"Nobody knows whence it comes, brother?\"\n\n\"I believe not, Jasper.\"\n\n\"Very poor, brother, not a nest of its own?\"\n\n\"So they say, Jasper.\"\n\n\"With every person's bad word, brother?\"\n\n\"Yes, Jasper, every person is mocking it.\"\n\n\"Tolerably merry, brother?\"\n\n\"Yes, tolerably merry, Jasper.\"\n\n\"Of no use at all, brother?\"\n\n\"None whatever, Jasper.\"\n\n\"You would be glad to get rid of the cuckoos, brother?\"\n\n\"Why, not exactly, Jasper; the cuckoo is a pleasant, funny bird, and its\npresence and voice give a great charm to the green trees and fields; no,\nI can't say I wish exactly to get rid of the cuckoo.\"\n\n\"Well, brother, what's a Romany chal?\"\n\n\"You must answer that question yourself, Jasper.\"\n\n\"A roguish, chaffing fellow, a'n't he, brother?\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, Jasper.\"\n\n\"Of no use at all, brother?\"\n\n\"Just so, Jasper; I see--\"\n\n\"Something very much like a cuckoo, brother?\"\n\n\"I see what you are after, Jasper.\"\n\n\"You would like to get rid of us, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"Why no, not exactly.\"\n\n\"We are no ornament to the green lanes in spring and summer time, are we,\nbrother? and the voices of our chies, with their cukkerin and dukkerin,\ndon't help to make them pleasant?\"\n\n\"I see what you are at, Jasper.\"\n\n\"You would wish to turn the cuckoos into barn-door fowls, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"Can't say I should, Jasper, whatever some people might wish.\"\n\n\"And the chals and chies into radical weavers and factory wenches, hey,\nbrother?\"\n\n\"Can't say that I should, Jasper.  You are certainly a picturesque\npeople, and in many respects an ornament both to town and country;\npainting and lil writing too are under great obligations to you.  What\npretty pictures are made out of your campings and groupings, and what\npretty books have been written in which gypsies, or at least creatures\nintended to represent gypsies, have been the principal figures.  I think\nif we were without you, we should begin to miss you.\"\n\n\"Just as you would the cuckoos, if they were all converted into barn-door\nfowls.  I tell you what, brother; frequently, as I have sat under a hedge\nin spring or summer time, and heard the cuckoo, I have thought that we\nchals and cuckoos are alike in many respects, but especially in\ncharacter.  Everybody speaks ill of us both, and everybody is glad to see\nboth of us again.\"\n\n\"Yes, Jasper, but there is some difference between men and cuckoos; men\nhave souls, Jasper!\"\n\n\"And why not cuckoos, brother?\"\n\n\"You should not talk so, Jasper; what you say is little short of\nblasphemy.  How should a bird have a soul?\"\n\n\"And how should a man?\"\n\n\"Oh, we know very well that a man has a soul.\"\n\n\"How do you know it?\"\n\n\"We know very well.\"\n\n\"Would you take your oath of it, brother--your bodily oath?\"\n\n\"Why, I think I might, Jasper!\"\n\n\"Did you ever see the soul, brother?\"\n\n\"No, I never saw it.\"\n\n\"Then how could you swear to it?  A pretty figure you would make in a\ncourt of justice, to swear to a thing which you never saw.  Hold up your\nhead, fellow.  When and where did you see it?  Now upon your oath,\nfellow, do you mean to say that this Roman stole the donkey's foal?  Oh,\nthere's no one for cross-questioning like Counsellor P---.  Our people\nwhen they are in a hobble always like to employ him, though he is\nsomewhat dear.  Now, brother, how can you get over the 'upon your oath,\nfellow, will you say that you have a soul?'\"\n\n\"Well, we will take no oaths on the subject; but you yourself believe in\nthe soul.  I have heard you say that you believe in dukkerin; now what is\ndukkerin but the soul science?\"\n\n\"When did I say that I believed in it?\"\n\n\"Why, after that fight, when you pointed to the bloody mark in the cloud,\nwhilst he you wot of was galloping in the barouche to the old town,\namidst the rain-cataracts, the thunder, and flame of heaven.\"\n\n\"I have some kind of remembrance of it, brother.\"\n\n\"Then, again, I heard you say that the dook of Abershaw rode every night\non horseback down the wooded hill.\"\n\n\"I say, brother, what a wonderful memory you have!\"\n\n\"I wish I had not, Jasper; but I can't help it, it is my misfortune.\"\n\n\"Misfortune! well, perhaps it is; at any rate it is very ungenteel to\nhave such a memory.  I have heard my wife say that to show you have a\nlong memory looks very vulgar; and that you can't give a greater proof of\ngentility than by forgetting a thing as soon as possible--more especially\na promise, or an acquaintance when he happens to be shabby.  Well,\nbrother, I don't deny that I may have said that I believe in dukkerin,\nand in Abershaw's dook, which you say is his soul; but what I believe one\nmoment, or say I believe, don't be certain that I shall believe the next,\nor say I do.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Jasper, I heard you say on a previous occasion, on quoting a\npiece of a song, that when a man dies he is cast into the earth, and\nthere's an end of him.\"\n\n\"I did, did I?  Lor' what a memory you have, brother.  But you are not\nsure that I hold that opinion now.\"\n\n\"Certainly not, Jasper.  Indeed, after such a sermon as we have been\nhearing, I should be very shocked if you held such an opinion.\"\n\n\"However, brother, don't be sure I do not, however shocking such an\nopinion may be to you.\"\n\n\"What an incomprehensible people you are, Jasper.\"\n\n\"We are rather so, brother; indeed, we have posed wiser heads than yours\nbefore now.\"\n\n\"You seem to care for so little, and yet you rove about a distinct race.\"\n\n\"I say, brother!\"\n\n\"Yes, Jasper.\"\n\n\"What do you think of our women?\"\n\n\"They have certainly very singular names, Jasper.\"\n\n\"Names!  Lavengro!  However, brother, if you had been as fond of things\nas of names, you would never have been a pal of ours.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Jasper?\"\n\n\"A'n't they rum animals?\"\n\n\"They have tongues of their own, Jasper.\"\n\n\"Did you ever feel their teeth and nails, brother?\"\n\n\"Never, Jasper, save Mrs. Herne's.  I have always been very civil to\nthem, so--\"\n\n\"They let you alone.  I say, brother, some part of the secret is in\nthem.\"\n\n\"They seem rather flighty, Jasper.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, brother!\"\n\n\"Rather fond of loose discourse!\"\n\n\"Rather so, brother.\"\n\n\"Can you always trust them, Jasper?\"\n\n\"We never watch them, brother.\"\n\n\"Can they always trust you?\"\n\n\"Not quite so well as we can them.  However, we get on very well\ntogether, except Mikailia and her husband; but Mikailia is a cripple, and\nis married to the beauty of the world, so she may be expected to be\njealous--though he would not part with her for a duchess, no more than I\nwould part with my rawnie, nor any other chal with his.\"\n\n\"Ay, but would not the chi part with the chal for a duke, Jasper?\"\n\n\"My Pakomovna gave up the duke for me, brother.\"\n\n\"But she occasionally talks of him, Jasper.\"\n\n\"Yes, brother, but Pakomovna was born on a common not far from the sign\nof the gammon.\"\n\n\"Gammon of bacon, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Yes, brother; but gammon likewise means--\"\n\n\"I know it does, Jasper; it means fun, ridicule, jest; it is an ancient\nNorse word, and is found in the Edda.\"\n\n\"Lor', brother! how learned in lils you are!\"\n\n\"Many words of Norse are to be found in our vulgar sayings, Jasper; for\nexample--in that particularly vulgar saying of ours, 'Your mother is up,'\nthere's a noble Norse word; mother, there, meaning not the female who\nbore us, but rage and choler, as I discovered by reading the Sagas,\nJasper.\"\n\n\"Lor', brother! how book-learned you be.\"\n\n\"Indifferently so, Jasper.  Then you think you might trust your wife with\nthe duke?\"\n\n\"I think I could, brother, or even with yourself.\"\n\n\"Myself, Jasper!  Oh, I never troubled my head about your wife; but I\nsuppose there have been love affairs between gorgios and Romany chies.\nWhy, novels are stuffed with such matters; and then even one of your own\nsongs says so--the song which Ursula was singing the other afternoon.\"\n\n\"That is somewhat of an old song, brother, and is sung by the chies as a\nwarning at our solemn festivals.\"\n\n\"Well! but there's your sister-in-law, Ursula, herself, Jasper.\"\n\n\"Ursula, herself, brother?\"\n\n\"You were talking of my having her, Jasper.\"\n\n\"Well, brother, why didn't you have her?\"\n\n\"Would she have had me?\"\n\n\"Of course, brother.  You are so much of a Roman, and speak Romany so\nremarkably well.\"\n\n\"Poor thing! she looks very innocent!\"\n\n\"Remarkably so, brother! however, though not born on the same common with\nmy wife, she knows a thing or two of Roman matters.\"\n\n\"I should like to ask her a question or two, Jasper, in connection with\nthat song.\"\n\n\"You can do no better, brother.  Here we are at the camp.  After tea,\ntake Ursula under a hedge, and ask her a question or two in connection\nwith that song.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nSunday Evening--Ursula--Action at Law--Meridiana--Married Already.\n\nI took tea that evening with Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro and Ursula, outside\nof their tent.  Tawno was not present, being engaged with his wife in his\nown tabernacle; Sylvester was there, however, lolling listlessly upon the\nground.  As I looked upon this man, I thought him one of the most\ndisagreeable fellows I had ever seen.  His features were ugly, and,\nmoreover, as dark as pepper; and, besides being dark, his skin was dirty.\nAs for his dress, it was torn and sordid.  His chest was broad, and his\narms seemed powerful; but, upon the whole, he looked a very caitiff.  \"I\nam sorry that man has lost his wife,\" thought I; \"for I am sure he will\nnever get another.\"  What surprises me is, that he ever found a woman\ndisposed to unite her lot with his!\n\nAfter tea I got up and strolled about the field.  My thoughts were upon\nIsopel Berners.  I wondered where she was, and how long she would stay\naway.  At length becoming tired and listless, I determined to return to\nthe dingle, and resume the reading of the Bible at the place where I had\nleft off.  \"What better could I do,\" methought, \"on a Sunday evening?\"  I\nwas then near the wood which surrounded the dingle, but at that side\nwhich was farthest from the encampment, which stood near the entrance.\nSuddenly, on turning round the southern corner of the copse, which\nsurrounded the dingle, I perceived Ursula seated under a thornbush.  I\nthought I never saw her look prettier than then, dressed as she was, in\nher Sunday's best.\n\n\"Good evening, Ursula,\" said I; \"I little thought to have the pleasure of\nseeing you here.\"\n\n\"Nor would you, brother,\" said Ursula, \"had not Jasper told me that you\nhad been talking about me, and wanted to speak to me under a hedge; so,\nhearing that, I watched your motions, and came here and sat down.\"\n\n\"I was thinking of going to my quarters in the dingle, to read the Bible,\nUrsula, but--\"\n\n\"Oh, pray then, go to your quarters, brother, and read the Miduveleskoe\nlil; you can speak to me under a hedge some other time.\"\n\n\"I think I will sit down with you, Ursula; for, after all, reading godly\nbooks in dingles at eve, is rather sombre work.  Yes, I think I will sit\ndown with you;\" and I sat down by her side.\n\n\"Well, brother, now you have sat down with me under the hedge, what have\nyou to say to me?\"\n\n\"Why, I hardly know, Ursula.\"\n\n\"Not know, brother; a pretty fellow you to ask young women to come and\nsit with you under hedges, and, when they come, not know what to say to\nthem.\"\n\n\"Oh! ah! I remember; do you know, Ursula, that I take a great interest in\nyou?\"\n\n\"Thank ye, brother; kind of you, at any rate.\"\n\n\"You must be exposed to a great many temptations, Ursula.\"\n\n\"A great many indeed, brother.  It is hard to see fine things, such as\nshawls, gold watches, and chains in the shops, behind the big glasses,\nand to know that they are not intended for one.  Many's the time I have\nbeen tempted to make a dash at them; but I bethought myself that by so\ndoing I should cut my hands, besides being almost certain of being\ngrabbed and sent across the gull's bath to the foreign country.\"\n\n\"Then you think gold and fine things temptations, Ursula?\"\n\n\"Of course, brother, very great temptations; don't you think them so?\"\n\n\"Can't say I do, Ursula.\"\n\n\"Then more fool you, brother; but have the kindness to tell me what you\nwould call a temptation?\"\n\n\"Why, for example, the hope of honour and renown, Ursula.\"\n\n\"The hope of honour and renown! very good, brother; but I tell you one\nthing, that unless you have money in your pocket, and good broad-cloth on\nyour back, you are not likely to obtain much honour and--what do you call\nit? amongst the gorgios, to say nothing of the Romany chals.\"\n\n\"I should have thought, Ursula, that the Romany chals, roaming about the\nworld as they do, free and independent, were above being led by such\ntrifles.\"\n\n\"Then you know nothing of the gypsies, brother; no people on earth are\nfonder of those trifles, as you call them, than the Romany chals, and\nmore disposed to respect those who have them.\"\n\n\"Then money and fine clothes would induce you to do anything, Ursula?\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, brother, anything.\"\n\n\"To chore, Ursula?\"\n\n\"Like enough, brother; gypsies have been transported before now for\nchoring.\"\n\n\"To hokkawar?\"\n\n\"Ay, ay; I was telling dukkerin only yesterday, brother.\"\n\n\"In fact, to break the law in everything?\"\n\n\"Who knows, brother, who knows? as I said before, gold and fine clothes\nare great temptations.\"\n\n\"Well, Ursula, I am sorry for it, I should never have thought you so\ndepraved.\"\n\n\"Indeed, brother.\"\n\n\"To think that I am seated by one who is willing to--to--\"\n\n\"Go on, brother.\"\n\n\"To play the thief.\"\n\n\"Go on, brother.\"\n\n\"The liar.\"\n\n\"Go on, brother.\"\n\n\"The--the--\"\n\n\"Go on, brother.\"\n\n\"The--the lubbeny.\"\n\n\"The what, brother?\" said Ursula, starting from her seat.\n\n\"Why, the lubbeny; don't you--\"\n\n\"I tell you what, brother,\" said Ursula, looking somewhat pale, and\nspeaking very low, \"if I had only something in my hand, I would do you a\nmischief.\"\n\n\"Why, what is the matter, Ursula?\" said I; \"how have I offended you?\"\n\n\"How have you offended me?  Why, didn't you insinivate just now that I\nwas ready to play the--the--\"\n\n\"Go on, Ursula.\"\n\n\"The--the--I'll not say it; but I only wish I had something in my hand.\"\n\n\"If I have offended, Ursula, I am very sorry for it; any offence I may\nhave given you was from want of understanding you.  Come, pray be seated,\nI have much to question you about--to talk to you about.\"\n\n\"Seated, not I!  It was only just now that you gave me to understand that\nyou was ashamed to be seated by me, a thief, a liar.\"\n\n\"Well, did you not almost give me to understand that you were both,\nUrsula?\"\n\n\"I don't much care being called a thief and a liar,\" said Ursula; \"a\nperson may be a liar and thief, and yet a very honest woman, but--\"\n\n\"Well, Ursula.\"\n\n\"I tell you what, brother, if you ever sinivate again that I could be the\nthird thing, so help me duvel!  I'll do you a mischief.  By my God I\nwill!\"\n\n\"Well, Ursula, I assure you that I shall sinivate, as you call it,\nnothing of the kind about you.  I have no doubt, from what you have said,\nthat you are a very paragon of virtue--a perfect Lucretia; but--\"\n\n\"My name is Ursula, brother, and not Lucretia: Lucretia is not of our\nfamily, but one of the Bucklands; she travels about Oxfordshire; yet I am\nas good as she any day.\"\n\n\"Lucretia; how odd!  Where could she have got that name?  Well, I make no\ndoubt, Ursula, that you are quite as good as she, and she as her namesake\nof ancient Rome; but there is a mystery in this same virtue, Ursula,\nwhich I cannot fathom; how a thief and a liar should be able, or indeed\nwilling, to preserve her virtue is what I don't understand.  You confess\nthat you are very fond of gold.  Now, how is it that you don't barter\nyour virtue for gold sometimes?  I am a philosopher, Ursula, and like to\nknow everything.  You must be every now and then exposed to great\ntemptation, Ursula; for you are of a beauty calculated to captivate all\nhearts.  Come, sit down and tell me how you are enabled to resist such a\ntemptation as gold and fine clothes?\"\n\n\"Well, brother,\" said Ursula, \"as you say you mean no harm, I will sit\ndown beside you, and enter into discourse with you; but I will uphold\nthat you are the coolest hand that I ever came nigh, and say the coolest\nthings.\"\n\nAnd thereupon Ursula sat down by my side.\n\n\"Well, Ursula, we will, if you please, discourse on the subject of your\ntemptations.  I suppose that you travel very much about, and show\nyourself in all kinds of places?\"\n\n\"In all kinds, brother; I travels, as you say, very much about, attends\nfairs and races, and enters booths and public-houses, where I tells\nfortunes, and sometimes dances and sings.\"\n\n\"And do not people often address you in a very free manner?\"\n\n\"Frequently, brother; and I give them tolerably free answers.\"\n\n\"Do people ever offer to make you presents?  I mean presents of value,\nsuch as--\"\n\n\"Silk handkerchiefs, shawls, and trinkets; very frequently, brother.\"\n\n\"And what do you do, Ursula?\"\n\n\"I takes what people offers me, brother, and stows it away as soon as I\ncan.\"\n\n\"Well, but don't people expect something for their presents?  I don't\nmean dukkerin, dancing, and the like; but such a moderate and innocent\nthing as a choomer, Ursula?\"\n\n\"Innocent thing, do you call it, brother?\"\n\n\"The world calls it so, Ursula.  Well, do the people who give you the\nfine things never expect a choomer in return?\"\n\n\"Very frequently, brother.\"\n\n\"And do you ever grant it?\"\n\n\"Never, brother.\"\n\n\"How do you avoid it?\"\n\n\"I gets away as soon as possible, brother.  If they follows me, I tries\nto baffle them, by means of jests and laughter; and if they persist, I\nuses bad and terrible language, of which I have plenty in store.\"\n\n\"But if your terrible language has no effect?\"\n\n\"Then I screams for the constable, and if he comes not, I uses my teeth\nand nails.\"\n\n\"And are they always sufficient?\"\n\n\"I have only had to use them twice, brother; but then I found them\nsufficient.\"\n\n\"But suppose the person who followed you was highly agreeable, Ursula?  A\nhandsome young officer of local militia, for example, all dressed in\nLincoln green, would you still refuse him the choomer?\"\n\n\"We makes no difference, brother; the daughters of the gypsy-father makes\nno difference; and what's more, sees none.\"\n\n\"Well, Ursula, the world will hardly give you credit for such\nindifference.\"\n\n\"What cares we for the world, brother! we are not of the world.\"\n\n\"But your fathers, brothers, and uncles, give you credit, I suppose,\nUrsula.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, brother, our fathers, brothers, and cokos gives us all manner of\ncredit; for example, I am telling lies and dukkerin in a public-house\nwhere my batu or coko--perhaps both--are playing on the fiddle; well, my\nbatu and my coko beholds me amongst the public-house crew, talking\nnonsense and hearing nonsense; but they are under no apprehension; and\npresently they sees the good-looking officer of militia, in his greens\nand Lincolns, get up and give me a wink, and I go out with him abroad,\ninto the dark night perhaps; well, my batu and my coko goes on fiddling\njust as if I were six miles off asleep in the tent, and not out in the\ndark street with the local officer, with his Lincolns and his greens.\"\n\n\"They know they can trust you, Ursula?\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, brother; and, what's more, I knows I can trust myself.\"\n\n\"So you would merely go out to make a fool of him, Ursula?\"\n\n\"Merely go out to make a fool of him, brother, I assure you.\"\n\n\"But such proceedings really have an odd look, Ursula.\"\n\n\"Amongst gorgios, very so, brother.\"\n\n\"Well, it must be rather unpleasant to lose one's character even amongst\ngorgios, Ursula; and suppose the officer, out of revenge for being\ntricked and duped by you, were to say of you the thing that is not, were\nto meet you on the race-course the next day, and boast of receiving\nfavours which he never had, amidst a knot of jeering militia-men, how\nwould you proceed, Ursula? would you not be abashed?\"\n\n\"By no means, brother; I should bring my action of law against him.\"\n\n\"Your action at law, Ursula?\"\n\n\"Yes, brother, I should give a whistle, whereupon all one's cokos and\nbatus, and all my near and distant relations, would leave their fiddling,\ndukkerin, and horse-dealing, and come flocking about me.  'What's the\nmatter, Ursula?' says my coko.  'Nothing at all,' I replies, 'save and\nexcept that gorgio, in his greens and his Lincolns, says that I have\nplayed the--with him.'  'Oho, he does, Ursula,' says my coko, 'try your\naction of law against him, my lamb,' and he puts something privily into\nmy hands; whereupon I goes close up to the grinning gorgio, and staring\nhim in the face, with my head pushed forward, I cries out: 'You say I did\nwhat was wrong with you last night when I was out with you abroad?'\n'Yes,' says the local officer, 'I says you did,' looking down all the\ntime.  'You are a liar,' says I, and forthwith I breaks his head with the\nstick which I holds behind me, and which my coko has conveyed privily\ninto my hand.\"\n\n\"And this is your action at law, Ursula?\"\n\n\"Yes, brother, this is my action at club-law.\"\n\n\"And would your breaking the fellow's head quite clear you of all\nsuspicion in the eyes of your batus, cokos, and what not?\"\n\n\"They would never suspect me at all, brother, because they would know\nthat I would never condescend to be over-intimate with a gorgio; the\nbreaking the head would be merely intended to justify Ursula in the eyes\nof the gorgios.\"\n\n\"And would it clear you in their eyes?\"\n\n\"Would it not, brother? when they saw the blood running down from the\nfellow's cracked poll on his greens and Lincolns, they would be quite\nsatisfied; why, the fellow would not be able to show his face at fair or\nmerry-making for a year and three-quarters.\"\n\n\"Did you ever try it, Ursula?\"\n\n\"Can't say I ever did, brother, but it would do.\"\n\n\"And how did you ever learn such a method of proceeding?\"\n\n\"Why, 't is advised by gypsy liri, brother.  It's part of our way of\nsettling difficulties amongst ourselves; for example, if a young Roman\nwere to say the thing which is not respecting Ursula and himself, Ursula\nwould call a great meeting of the people, who would all sit down in a\nring, the young fellow amongst them; a coko would then put a stick in\nUrsula's hand, who would then get up and go to the young fellow, and say,\n'Did I play the--with you?' and were he to say 'Yes,' she would crack his\nhead before the eyes of all.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"Ursula, I was bred an apprentice to gorgio law, and of\ncourse ought to stand up for it, whenever I conscientiously can, but I\nmust say the gypsy manner of bringing an action for defamation is much\nless tedious, and far more satisfactory, than the gorgiko one.  I wish\nyou now to clear up a certain point which is rather mysterious to me.  You\nsay that for a Romany chi to do what is unseemly with a gorgio is quite\nout of the question, yet only the other day I heard you singing a song in\nwhich a Romany chi confesses herself to be cambri by a grand gorgious\ngentleman.\"\n\n\"A sad let down,\" said Ursula.\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"sad or not, there's the song that speaks of the thing,\nwhich you give me to understand is not.\"\n\n\"Well, if the thing ever was,\" said Ursula, \"it was a long time ago, and\nperhaps, after all, not true.\"\n\n\"Then why do you sing the song?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you, brother, we sings the song now and then to be a warning\nto ourselves to have as little to do as possible in the way of\nacquaintance with the gorgios; and a warning it is; you see how the young\nwoman in the song was driven out of her tent by her mother, with all kind\nof disgrace and bad language; but you don't know that she was afterwards\nburied alive by her cokos and pals, in an uninhabited place; the song\ndoesn't say it, but the story says it, for there is a story about it,\nthough, as I said before, it was a long time ago, and perhaps, after all,\nwasn't true.\"\n\n\"But if such a thing were to happen at present, would the cokos and pals\nbury the girl alive?\"\n\n\"I can't say what they would do,\" said Ursula; \"I suppose they are not so\nstrict as they were long ago; at any rate, she would be driven from the\ntan, and avoided by all her family and relations as a gorgio's\nacquaintance; so that, perhaps, at last, she would be glad if they would\nbury her alive.\"\n\n\"Well, I can conceive that there would be an objection on the part of the\ncokos and batus that a Romany chi should form an improper acquaintance\nwith a gorgio, but I should think that the batus and cokos could hardly\nobject to the chi's entering into the honourable estate of wedlock with a\ngorgio.\"\n\nUrsula was silent.\n\n\"Marriage is an honourable estate, Ursula.\"\n\n\"Well, brother, suppose it be?\"\n\n\"I don't see why a Romany chi should object to enter into the honourable\nestate of wedlock with a gorgio.\"\n\n\"You don't, brother; don't you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I; \"and, moreover, I am aware, notwithstanding your evasion,\nUrsula, that marriages and connections now and then occur between gorgios\nand Romany chies; the result of which is the mixed breed, called half and\nhalf, which is at present travelling about England, and to which the\nFlaming Tinman belongs, otherwise called Anselo Herne.\"\n\n\"As for the half and halfs,\" said Ursula, \"they are a bad set; and there\nis not a worse blackguard in England than Anselo Herne.\"\n\n\"All that you say may be very true, Ursula, but you admit that there are\nhalf and halfs.\"\n\n\"The more's the pity, brother.\"\n\n\"Pity, or not, you admit the fact; but how do you account for it?\"\n\n\"How do I account for it? why, I will tell you, by the break up of a\nRoman family, brother--the father of a small family dies, and, perhaps,\nthe mother; and the poor children are left behind; sometimes, they are\ngathered up by their relations, and sometimes, if they have none, by\ncharitable Romans, who bring them up in the observance of gypsy law; but\nsometimes they are not so lucky, and falls into the company of gorgios,\ntrampers, and basket-makers, who live in caravans, with whom they take\nup, and so--I hate to talk of the matter, brother; but so comes this race\nof the half and halfs.\"\n\n\"Then you mean to say, Ursula, that no Romany chi, unless compelled by\nhard necessity, would have anything to do with a gorgio?\"\n\n\"We are not over-fond of gorgios, brother, and we hates basket-makers,\nand folks that live in caravans.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"suppose a gorgio who is not a basket-maker, a fine,\nhandsome gorgious gentleman, who lives in a fine house--\"\n\n\"We are not fond of houses, brother; I never slept in a house in my\nlife.\"\n\n\"But would not plenty of money induce you?\"\n\n\"I hate houses, brother, and those who live in them.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose such a person were willing to resign his fine house; and,\nfor love of you, to adopt gypsy law, speak Romany, and live in a tan,\nwould you have nothing to say to him?\"\n\n\"Bringing plenty of money with him, brother?\"\n\n\"Well, bringing plenty of money with him, Ursula.\"\n\n\"Well, brother, suppose you produce your man; where is he?\"\n\n\"I was merely supposing such a person, Ursula.\"\n\n\"Then you don't know of such a person, brother?\"\n\n\"Why, no, Ursula; why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Because, brother, I was almost beginning to think that you meant\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Myself!  Ursula; I have no fine house to resign; nor have I money.\nMoreover, Ursula, though I have a great regard for you, and though I\nconsider you very handsome, quite as handsome, indeed, as Meridiana in--\"\n\n\"Meridiana! where did you meet with her?\" said Ursula, with a toss of her\nhead.\n\n\"Why, in old Pulci's--\"\n\n\"At old Fulcher's! that's not true, brother.  Meridiana is a Borzlam, and\ntravels with her own people, and not with old Fulcher, who is a gorgio,\nand a basket-maker.\"\n\n\"I was not speaking of old Fulcher, but Pulci, a great Italian writer,\nwho lived many hundred years ago, and who, in his poem called 'Morgante\nMaggiore,' speaks of Meridiana, the daughter of--\"\n\n\"Old Carus Borzlam,\" said Ursula; \"but if the fellow you mention lived so\nmany hundred years ago, how, in the name of wonder, could he know\nanything of Meridiana?\"\n\n\"The wonder, Ursula, is, how your people could ever have got hold of that\nname, and similar ones.  The Meridiana of Pulci was not the daughter of\nold Carus Borzlam, but of Caradoro, a great pagan king of the East, who,\nbeing besieged in his capital by Manfredonio, another mighty pagan king,\nwho wished to obtain possession of his daughter, who had refused him, was\nrelieved in his distress by certain paladins of Charlemagne, with one of\nwhom, Oliver, his daughter Meridiana fell in love.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said, Ursula, \"that it must have been altogether a different\nperson, for I am sure that Meridiana Borzlam would never have fallen in\nlove with Oliver.  Oliver! why, that is the name of the curo-mengro, who\nlost the fight near the chong gav, the day of the great tempest, when I\ngot wet through.  No, no!  Meridiana Borzlam would never have so far\nforgot her blood as to take up with Tom Oliver.\"\n\n\"I was not talking of that Oliver, Ursula, but of Oliver, peer of France,\nand paladin of Charlemagne, with whom Meridiana, daughter of Caradoro,\nfell in love, and for whose sake she renounced her religion and became a\nChristian, and finally ingravidata, or cambri, by him:--\n\n   'E nacquene un figliuol, dice la storia,\n   Che dette a Carlo-man poi gran vittoria;'\n\nwhich means--\"\n\n\"I don't want to know what it means,\" said Ursula; \"no good, I'm sure.\nWell, if the Meridiana of Charles's wain's pal was no handsomer than\nMeridiana Borzlam, she was no great catch, brother; for though I am by no\nmeans given to vanity, I think myself better to look at than she, though\nI will say she is no lubbeny, and would scorn--\"\n\n\"I make no doubt she would, Ursula, and I make no doubt that you are much\nhandsomer than she, or even the Meridiana of Oliver.  What I was about to\nsay, before you interrupted me, is this, that though I have a great\nregard for you, and highly admire you, it is only in a brotherly way,\nand--\"\n\n\"And you had nothing better to say to me,\" said Ursula, \"when you wanted\nto talk to me beneath a hedge, than that you liked me in a brotherly way\nI well, I declare--\"\n\n\"You seem disappointed, Ursula.\"\n\n\"Disappointed, brother! not I.\"\n\n\"You were just now saying that you disliked gorgios, so, of course, could\nonly wish that I, who am a gorgio, should like you in a brotherly way: I\nwished to have a conversation with you beneath a hedge, but only with the\nview of procuring from you some information respecting the song which you\nsung the other day, and the conduct of Roman females, which has always\nstruck me as being highly unaccountable; so, if you thought anything\nelse--\"\n\n\"What else should I expect from a picker-up of old words, brother?  Bah!\nI dislike a picker-up of old words worse than a picker-up of old rags.\"\n\n\"Don't be angry, Ursula, I feel a great interest in you; you are very\nhandsome, and very clever; indeed, with your beauty and cleverness, I\nonly wonder that you have not long since been married.\"\n\n\"You do, do you, brother?\"\n\n\"Yes.  However, keep up your spirits, Ursula, you are not much past the\nprime of youth, so--\"\n\n\"Not much past the prime of youth!  Don't be uncivil, brother, I was only\ntwenty-two last month.\"\n\n\"Don't be offended, Ursula, but twenty-two is twenty-two, or, I should\nrather say, that twenty-two in a woman is more than twenty-six in a man.\nYou are still very beautiful, but I advise you to accept the first offer\nthat's made to you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, brother, but your advice comes rather late; I accepted the\nfirst offer that was made me five years ago.\"\n\n\"You married five years ago, Ursula! is it possible?\"\n\n\"Quite possible, brother, I assure you.\"\n\n\"And how came I to know nothing about it?\"\n\n\"How comes it that you don't know many thousand things about the Romans,\nbrother?  Do you think they tell you all their affairs?\"\n\n\"Married, Ursula, married! well, I declare!\"\n\n\"You seem disappointed, brother.\"\n\n\"Disappointed!  Oh! no, not at all; but Jasper, only a few weeks ago,\ntold me that you were not married; and, indeed, almost gave me to\nunderstand that you would be very glad to get a husband.\"\n\n\"And you believed him?  I'll tell you, brother, for your instruction,\nthat there is not in the whole world a greater liar than Jasper\nPetulengro.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear it, Ursula; but with respect to him you married--who\nmight he be?  A gorgio, or a Romany chal?\"\n\n\"Gorgio, or Romany chal!  Do you think I would ever condescend to a\ngorgio!  It was a Camomescro, brother, a Lovell, a distant relation of my\nown.\"\n\n\"And where is he? and what became of him!  Have you any family?\"\n\n\"Don't think I am going to tell you all my history, brother; and, to tell\nyou the truth, I am tired of sitting under hedges with you, talking\nnonsense.  I shall go to my house.\"\n\n\"Do sit a little longer, sister Ursula.  I most heartily congratulate you\non your marriage.  But where is this same Lovell?  I have never seen him:\nI wish to congratulate him too.  You are quite as handsome as the\nMeridiana of Pulci, Ursula, ay, or the Despina of Riciardetto.\nRiciardetto, Ursula, is a poem written by one Fortiguerra, about ninety\nyears ago, in imitation of the Morgante of Pulci.  It treats of the wars\nof Charlemagne and his Paladins with various barbarous nations, who came\nto besiege Paris.  Despina was the daughter and heiress of Scricca, King\nof Cafria; she was the beloved of Riciardetto, and was beautiful as an\nangel; but I make no doubt you are quite as handsome as she.\"\n\n\"Brother,\" said Ursula--but the reply of Ursula I reserve for another\nchapter, the present having attained to rather an uncommon length, for\nwhich, however, the importance of the matter discussed is a sufficient\napology.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nUrsula's Tale--The Patteran--The Deep Water--Second Husband.\n\n\"Brother,\" said Ursula, plucking a dandelion which grew at her feet, \"I\nhave always said that a more civil and pleasant-spoken person than\nyourself can't be found.  I have a great regard for you and your\nlearning, and am willing to do you any pleasure in the way of words or\nconversation.  Mine is not a very happy story, but as you wish to hear\nit, it is quite at your service.  Launcelot Lovell made me an offer, as\nyou call it, and we were married in Roman fashion; that is, we gave each\nother our right hands, and promised to be true to each other.  We lived\ntogether two years, travelling sometimes by ourselves, sometimes with our\nrelations; I bore him two children, both of which were still-born,\npartly, I believe, from the fatigue I underwent in running about the\ncountry telling dukkerin when I was not exactly in a state to do so, and\npartly from the kicks and blows which my husband Launcelot was in the\nhabit of giving me every night, provided I came home with less than five\nshillings, which it is sometimes impossible to make in the country,\nprovided no fair or merry-making is going on.  At the end of two years my\nhusband, Launcelot, whistled a horse from a farmer's field, and sold it\nfor forty-pounds; and for that horse he was taken, put in prison, tried,\nand condemned to be sent to the other country for life.  Two days before\nhe was to be sent away, I got leave to see him in the prison, and in the\npresence of the turnkey I gave him a thin cake of gingerbread, in which\nthere was a dainty saw which could cut through iron.  I then took on\nwonderfully, turned my eyes inside out, fell down in a seeming fit, and\nwas carried out of the prison.  That same night my husband sawed his\nirons off, cut through the bars of his window, and dropping down a height\nof fifty feet, lighted on his legs, and came and joined me on a heath\nwhere I was camped alone.  We were just getting things ready to be off,\nwhen we heard people coming, and sure enough they were runners after my\nhusband, Launcelot Lovell; for his escape had been discovered within a\nquarter of an hour after he had got away.  My husband, without bidding me\nfarewell, set off at full speed, and they after him, but they could not\ntake him, and so they came back and took me, and shook me, and threatened\nme, and had me before the poknees, who shook his head at me, and\nthreatened me in order to make me discover where my husband was, but I\nsaid I did not know, which was true enough; not that I would have told\nhim if I had.  So at last the poknees and the runners, not being able to\nmake anything out of me, were obliged to let me go, and I went in search\nof my husband.  I wandered about with my cart for several days in the\ndirection in which I saw him run off, with my eyes bent on the ground,\nbut could see no marks of him; at last, coming to four cross roads, I saw\nmy husband's patteran.\"\n\n\"You saw your husband's patteran?\"\n\n\"Yes, brother.  Do you know what patteran means?\"\n\n\"Of course, Ursula; the gypsy trail, the handful of grass which the\ngypsies strew in the roads as they travel, to give information to any of\ntheir companions who may be behind, as to the route they have taken.  The\ngypsy patteran has always had a strange interest for me, Ursula.\"\n\n\"Like enough, brother; but what does patteran mean?\"\n\n\"Why, the gypsy trail, formed as I told you before.\"\n\n\"And you know nothing more about patteran, brother?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all, Ursula; do you?\"\n\n\"What's the name for the leaf of a tree, brother?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said I; \"it's odd enough that I have asked that question\nof a dozen Romany chals and chies, and they always told me that they did\nnot know.\"\n\n\"No more they did, brother; there's only one person in England that\nknows, and that's myself--the name for a leaf is patteran.  Now there are\ntwo that knows it--the other is yourself.\"\n\n\"Dear me, Ursula, how very strange!  I am much obliged to you.  I think I\nnever saw you look so pretty as you do now; but who told you?\"\n\n\"My mother, Mrs. Herne, told it me one day, brother, when she was in a\ngood humour, which she very seldom was, as no one has a better right to\nknow than yourself, as she hated you mortally: it was one day when you\nhad been asking our company what was the word for a leaf, and nobody\ncould tell you, that she took me aside and told me, for she was in a good\nhumour, and triumphed in seeing you balked.  She told me the word for\nleaf was patteran, which our people use now for trail, having forgotten\nthe true meaning.  She said that the trail was called patteran, because\nthe gypsies of old were in the habit of making the marks with the leaves\nand branches of trees, placed in a certain manner.  She said that nobody\nknew it but herself, who was one of the old sort, and begged me never to\ntell the word to any one but him I should marry; and to be particularly\ncautious never to let you know it, whom she hated.  Well, brother,\nperhaps I have done wrong to tell you; but, as I said before, I likes\nyou, and am always ready to do your pleasure in words and conversation;\nmy mother, moreover, is dead and gone, and, poor thing, will never know\nanything about the matter.  So, when I married, I told my husband about\nthe patteran, and we were in the habit of making our private trails with\nleaves and branches of trees, which none of the other gypsy people did;\nso, when I saw my husband's patteran, I knew it at once, and I followed\nit upwards of two hundred miles towards the north; and then I came to a\ndeep, awful-looking water, with an overhanging bank, and on the bank I\nfound the patteran, which directed me to proceed along the bank towards\nthe east, and I followed my husband's patteran towards the east; and\nbefore I had gone half a mile, I came to a place where I saw the bank had\ngiven way, and fallen into the deep water.  Without paying much heed, I\npassed on, and presently came to a public-house, not far from the water,\nand I entered the public-house to get a little beer, and perhaps to tell\na dukkerin, for I saw a great many people about the door; and, when I\nentered, I found there was what they calls an inquest being held upon a\nbody in that house, and the jury had just risen to go and look at the\nbody; and being a woman, and having a curiosity, I thought I would go\nwith them, and so I did; and no sooner did I see the body, than I knew it\nto be my husband's; it was much swelled and altered, but I knew it partly\nby the clothes, and partly by a mark on the forehead, and I cried out,\n'It is my husband's body,' and I fell down in a fit, and the fit that\ntime, brother, was not a seeming one.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" said I, \"how terrible! but tell me, Ursula, how did your\nhusband come by his death?\"\n\n\"The bank, overhanging the deep water, gave way under him, brother, and\nhe was drowned; for, like most of our people, he could not swim, or only\na little.  The body, after it had been in the water a long time, came up\nof itself, and was found floating.  Well, brother, when the people of the\nneighbourhood found that I was the wife of the drowned man, they were\nvery kind to me, and made a subscription for me, with which, after having\nseen my husband buried, I returned the way I had come, till I met Jasper\nand his people, and with them I have travelled ever since: I was very\nmelancholy for a long time, I assure you, brother; for the death of my\nhusband preyed very much upon my mind.\"\n\n\"His death was certainly a very shocking one, Ursula; but, really, if he\nhad died a natural one, you could scarcely have regretted it, for he\nappears to have treated you barbarously.\"\n\n\"Women must bear, brother; and, barring that he kicked and beat me, and\ndrove me out to tell dukkerin when I could scarcely stand, he was not a\nbad husband.  A man, by gypsy law, brother, is allowed to kick and beat\nhis wife, and to bury her alive, if he thinks proper.  I am a gypsy, and\nhave nothing to say against the law.\"\n\n\"But what has Mikailia Chikno to say about it?\"\n\n\"She is a cripple, brother, the only cripple amongst the Roman people: so\nshe is allowed to do and say as she pleases.  Moreover, her husband does\nnot think fit to kick or beat her, though it is my opinion she would like\nhim all the better if he were occasionally to do so, and threaten to bury\nher alive; at any rate, she would treat him better, and respect him\nmore.\"\n\n\"Your sister does not seem to stand much in awe of Jasper Petulengro,\nUrsula.\"\n\n\"Let the matters of my sister and Jasper Petulengro alone, brother; you\nmust travel in their company some time before you can understand them;\nthey are a strange two, up to all kind of chaffing: but two more regular\nRomans don't breathe, and I'll tell you, for your instruction, that there\nisn't a better mare-breaker in England than Jasper Petulengro, if you can\nmanage Miss Isopel Berners as well as--\"\n\n\"Isopel Berners,\" said I, \"how came you to think of her?\"\n\n\"How should I but think of her, brother, living as she does with you in\nMumper's dingle, and travelling about with you; you will have, brother,\nmore difficulty to manage her, than Jasper has to manage my sister\nPakomovna.  I should have mentioned her before, only I wanted to know\nwhat you had to say to me; and when we got into discourse, I forgot her.\nI say, brother, let me tell you your dukkerin, with respect to her, you\nwill never--\"\n\n\"I want to hear no dukkerin, Ursula.\"\n\n\"Do let me tell you your dukkerin, brother, you will never manage--\"\n\n\"I want to hear no dukkerin, Ursula, in connection with Isopel Berners.\nMoreover, it is Sunday, we will change the subject; it is surprising to\nme that, after all you have undergone, you should look so beautiful.  I\nsuppose you do not think of marrying again, Ursula?\"\n\n\"No, brother, one husband at a time is quite enough for any reasonable\nmort; especially such a good husband as I have got.\"\n\n\"Such a good husband! why, I thought you told me your husband was\ndrowned?\"\n\n\"Yes, brother, my first husband was.\"\n\n\"And have you a second?\"\n\n\"To be sure, brother.\"\n\n\"And who is he? in the name of wonder.\"\n\n\"Who is he? why Sylvester, to be sure.\"\n\n\"I do assure you, Ursula, that I feel disposed to be angry with you; such\na handsome young woman as yourself to take up with such a nasty pepper-\nfaced good for nothing--\"\n\n\"I won't hear my husband abused, brother; so you had better say no more.\"\n\n\"Why, is he not the Lazarus of the gypsies? has he a penny of his own,\nUrsula?\"\n\n\"Then the more his want, brother, of a clever chi like me to take care of\nhim and his childer.  I tell you what, brother, I will chore, if\nnecessary, and tell dukkerin for Sylvester, if even so heavy as scarcely\nto be able to stand.  You call him lazy; you would not think him lazy if\nyou were in a ring with him: he is a proper man with his hands; Jasper is\ngoing to back him for twenty pounds against Slammocks of the Chong gav,\nthe brother of Roarer and Bell-metal, he says he has no doubt that he\nwill win.\"\n\n\"Well, if you like him, I, of course, can have no objection.  Have you\nbeen long married?\"\n\n\"About a fortnight, brother; that dinner, the other day, when I sang the\nsong, was given in celebration of the wedding.\"\n\n\"Were you married in a church, Ursula?\"\n\n\"We were not, brother; none but gorgios, cripples, and lubbenys are ever\nmarried in a church: we took each other's words.  Brother, I have been\nwith you near three hours beneath this hedge.  I will go to my husband.\"\n\n\"Does he know that you are here?\"\n\n\"He does, brother.\"\n\n\"And is he satisfied?\"\n\n\"Satisfied! of course.  Lor', you gorgies!  Brother, I go to my husband\nand my house.\"  And, thereupon, Ursula rose and departed.\n\nAfter waiting a little time I also arose; it was now dark, and I thought\nI could do no better than betake myself to the dingle; at the entrance of\nit I found Mr. Petulengro.  \"Well, brother,\" said he, \"what kind of\nconversation have you and Ursula had beneath the hedge?\"\n\n\"If you wished to hear what we were talking about, you should have come\nand sat down beside us; you knew where we were.\"\n\n\"Well, brother, I did much the same, for I went and sat down behind you.\"\n\n\"Behind the hedge, Jasper?\"\n\n\"Behind the hedge, brother.\"\n\n\"And heard all our conversation.\"\n\n\"Every word, brother; and a rum conversation it was.\"\n\n\"'Tis an old saying, Jasper, that listeners never hear any good of\nthemselves; perhaps you heard the epithet that Ursula bestowed upon you.\"\n\n\"If, by epitaph, you mean that she called me a liar, I did, brother, and\nshe was not much wrong, for I certainly do not always stick exactly to\ntruth; you, however, have not much to complain of me.\"\n\n\"You deceived me about Ursula, giving me to understand she was not\nmarried.\"\n\n\"She was not married when I told you so, brother; that is, not to\nSylvester; nor was I aware that she was going to marry him.  I once\nthought you had a kind of regard for her, and I am sure she had as much\nfor you as a Romany chi can have for a gorgio.  I half expected to have\nheard you make love to her behind the hedge, but I begin to think you\ncare for nothing in this world but old words and strange stories.  Lor'\nto take a young woman under a hedge, and talk to her as you did to\nUrsula; and yet you got everything out of her that you wanted, with your\ngammon about old Fulcher and Meridiana.  You are a cunning one, brother.\"\n\n\"There you are mistaken, Jasper.  I am not cunning.  If people think I\nam, it is because, being made up of art themselves, simplicity of\ncharacter is a puzzle to them.  Your women are certainly extraordinary\ncreatures, Jasper.\"\n\n\"Didn't I say they were rum animals?  Brother, we Romans shall always\nstick together as long as they stick fast to us.\"\n\n\"Do you think they always will, Jasper?\"\n\n\"Can't say, brother; nothing lasts for ever.  Romany chies are Romany\nchies still, though not exactly what they were sixty years ago.  My wife,\nthough a rum one, is not Mrs. Herne, brother.  I think she is rather fond\nof Frenchmen and French discourse.  I tell you what, brother, if ever\ngypsyism breaks up, it will be owing to our chies having been bitten by\nthat mad puppy they calls gentility.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nThe Dingle at Night--The Two Sides of the Question--Roman Females--Filling\nthe Kettle--The Dream--The Tall Figure.\n\nI descended to the bottom of the dingle.  It was nearly involved in\nobscurity.  To dissipate the feeling of melancholy which came over my\nmind, I resolved to kindle a fire; and having heaped dry sticks upon my\nhearth, and added a billet or two, I struck a light, and soon produced a\nblaze.  Sitting down, I fixed my eyes upon the blaze, and soon fell into\na deep meditation.  I thought of the events of the day, the scene at\nchurch, and what I had heard at church, the danger of losing one's soul,\nthe doubts of Jasper Petulengro as to whether one had a soul.  I thought\nover the various arguments which I had either heard, or which had come\nspontaneously to my mind, for or against the probability of a state of\nfuture existence.  They appeared to me to be tolerably evenly balanced.  I\nthen thought that it was at all events taking the safest part to conclude\nthat there was a soul.  It would be a terrible thing, after having passed\none's life in the disbelief of the existence of a soul, to wake up after\ndeath a soul, and to find one's self a lost soul.  Yes, methought I would\ncome to the conclusion that one has a soul.  Choosing the safe side,\nhowever, appeared to me to be playing a rather dastardly part.  I had\nnever been an admirer of people who chose the safe side in everything;\nindeed I had always entertained a thorough contempt for them.  Surely it\nwould be showing more manhood to adopt the dangerous side, that of\ndisbelief; I almost resolved to do so--but yet in a question of so much\nimportance, I ought not to be guided by vanity.  The question was not\nwhich was the safe, but the true side? yet how was I to know which was\nthe true side?  Then I thought of the Bible--which I had been reading in\nthe morning--that spoke of the soul and a future state; but was the Bible\ntrue?  I had heard learned and moral men say that it was true, but I had\nalso heard learned and moral men say that it was not: how was I to\ndecide?  Still that balance of probabilities!  If I could but see the way\nof truth, I would follow it, if necessary, upon hands and knees; on that\nI was determined; but I could not see it.  Feeling my brain begin to turn\nround, I resolved to think of something else; and forthwith began to\nthink of what had passed between Ursula and myself in our discourse\nbeneath the hedge.\n\nI mused deeply on what she had told me as to the virtue of the females of\nher race.  How singular that virtue must be which was kept pure and\nimmaculate by the possessor, whilst indulging in habits of falsehood and\ndishonesty!  I had always thought the gypsy females extraordinary beings.\nI had often wondered at them, their dress, their manner of speaking, and,\nnot least, at their names; but, until the present day, I had been\nunacquainted with the most extraordinary point connected with them.  How\ncame they possessed of this extraordinary virtue? was it because they\nwere thievish?  I remembered that an ancient thief-taker, who had retired\nfrom his useful calling, and who frequently visited the office of my\nmaster at law, the respectable S---, who had the management of his\nproperty--I remembered to have heard this worthy, with whom I\noccasionally held discourse, philosophic and profound, when he and I\nchanced to be alone together in the office, say that all first-rate\nthieves were sober, and of well-regulated morals, their bodily passions\nbeing kept in abeyance by their love of gain; but this axiom could\nscarcely hold good with respect to these women--however thievish they\nmight be, they did care for something besides gain: they cared for their\nhusbands.  If they did thieve, they merely thieved for their husbands;\nand though, perhaps, some of them were vain, they merely prized their\nbeauty because it gave them favour in the eyes of their husbands.\nWhatever the husbands were--and Jasper had almost insinuated that the\nmales occasionally allowed themselves some latitude--they appeared to be\nas faithful to their husbands as the ancient Roman matrons were to\ntheirs.  Roman matrons! and, after all, might not these be in reality\nRoman matrons?  They called themselves Romans; might not they be the\ndescendants of the old Roman matrons?  Might not they be of the same\nblood as Lucretia?  And were not many of their strange names--Lucretia\namongst the rest--handed down to them from old Rome?  It is true their\nlanguage was not that of old Rome; it was not, however, altogether\ndifferent from it.  After all, the ancient Romans might be a tribe of\nthese people, who settled down and founded a village with the tilts of\ncarts, which, by degrees, and the influx of other people, became the\ngrand city of the world.  I liked the idea of the grand city of the world\nowing its origin to a people who had been in the habit of carrying their\nhouses in their carts.  Why, after all, should not the Romans of history\nbe a branch of these Romans?  There were several points of similarity\nbetween them; if Roman matrons were chaste, both men and women were\nthieves.  Old Rome was the thief of the world; yet still there were\ndifficulties to be removed before I could persuade myself that the old\nRomans and my Romans were identical; and in trying to remove these\ndifficulties, I felt my brain once more beginning to turn, and in haste\ntook up another subject of meditation, and that was the patteran, and\nwhat Ursula had told me about it.\n\nI had always entertained a strange interest for that sign by which in\ntheir wanderings the Romanese gave to those of their people who came\nbehind intimation as to the direction which they took; but it now\ninspired me with greater interest than ever,--now that I had learnt that\nthe proper meaning of it was the leaves of trees.  I had, as I had said\nin my dialogue with Ursula, been very eager to learn the word for leaf in\nthe Romanian language, but had never learnt it till this day; so patteran\nsignified leaf of a tree; and no one at present knew that but myself and\nUrsula, who had learnt it from Mrs. Herne, the last, it was said, of the\nold stock; and then I thought what strange people the gypsies must have\nbeen in the old time.  They were sufficiently strange at present, but\nthey must have been far stranger of old; they must have been a more\npeculiar people--their language must have been more perfect--and they\nmust have had a greater stock of strange secrets.  I almost wished that I\nhad lived some two or three hundred years ago, that I might have observed\nthese people when they were yet stranger than at present.  I wondered\nwhether I could have introduced myself to their company at that period,\nwhether I should have been so fortunate as to meet such a strange, half-\nmalicious, half good-humoured being as Jasper, who would have instructed\nme in the language, then more deserving of note than at present.  What\nmight I not have done with that language, had I known it in its purity?\nWhy, I might have written books in it; yet those who spoke it would\nhardly have admitted me to their society at that period, when they kept\nmore to themselves.  Yet I thought that I might possibly have gained\ntheir confidence, and have wandered about with them, and learnt their\nlanguage, and all their strange ways, and then--and then--and a sigh rose\nfrom the depth of my breast; for I began to think, \"Supposing I had\naccomplished all this, what would have been the profit of it; and in what\nwould all this wild gypsy dream have terminated?\"\n\nThen rose another sigh, yet more profound, for I began to think, \"What\nwas likely to be the profit of my present way of life; the living in\ndingles, making pony and donkey shoes, conversing with gypsy-women under\nhedges, and extracting from them their odd secrets?\"  What was likely to\nbe the profit of such a kind of life, even should it continue for a\nlength of time?--a supposition not very probable, for I was earning\nnothing to support me, and the funds with which I had entered upon this\nlife were gradually disappearing.  I was living, it is true, not\nunpleasantly, enjoying the healthy air of heaven; but, upon the whole,\nwas I not sadly misspending my time?  Surely I was; and, as I looked\nback, it appeared to me that I had always been doing so.  What had been\nthe profit of the tongues which I had learnt? had they ever assisted me\nin the day of hunger?  No, no! it appeared to me that I had always\nmisspent my time, save in one instance, when by a desperate effort I had\ncollected all the powers of my imagination, and written the \"Life of\nJoseph Sell;\" but even when I wrote the Life of Sell, was I not in a\nfalse position?  Provided I had not misspent my time, would it have been\nnecessary to make that effort, which, after all, had only enabled me to\nleave London, and wander about the country for a time?  But could I,\ntaking all circumstances into consideration, have done better than I had?\nWith my peculiar temperament and ideas, could I have pursued with\nadvantage the profession to which my respectable parents had endeavoured\nto bring me up?  It appeared to me that I could not, and that the hand of\nnecessity had guided me from my earliest years, until the present night,\nin which I found myself seated in the dingle, staring on the brands of\nthe fire.  But ceasing to think of the past which, as irrecoverably gone,\nit was useless to regret, even were there cause to regret it, what should\nI do in future?  Should I write another book like the Life of Joseph\nSell; take it to London, and offer it to a publisher?  But when I\nreflected on the grisly sufferings which I had undergone whilst engaged\nin writing the Life of Sell, I shrank from the idea of a similar attempt;\nmoreover, I doubted whether I possessed the power to write a similar\nwork--whether the materials for the life of another Sell lurked within\nthe recesses of my brain?  Had I not better become in reality what I had\nhitherto been merely playing at--a tinker or a gypsy?  But I soon saw\nthat I was not fitted to become either in reality.  It was much more\nagreeable to play the gypsy or the tinker than to become either in\nreality.  I had seen enough of gypsying and tinkering to be convinced of\nthat.  All of a sudden the idea of tilling the soil came into my head;\ntilling the soil was a healthful and noble pursuit! but my idea of\ntilling the soil had no connection with Britain; for I could only expect\nto till the soil in Britain as a serf.  I thought of tilling it in\nAmerica, in which it was said there was plenty of wild, unclaimed land,\nof which any one, who chose to clear it of its trees, might take\npossession.  I figured myself in America, in an immense forest, clearing\nthe land destined, by my exertions, to become a fruitful and smiling\nplain.  Methought I heard the crash of the huge trees as they fell\nbeneath my axe; and then I bethought me that a man was intended to\nmarry--I ought to marry; and if I married, where was I likely to be more\nhappy as a husband and a father than in America, engaged in tilling the\nground?  I fancied myself in America, engaged in tilling the ground,\nassisted by an enormous progeny.  Well, why not marry, and go and till\nthe ground in America?  I was young, and youth was the time to marry in,\nand to labour in.  I had the use of all my faculties; my eyes, it is\ntrue, were rather dull from early study, and from writing the Life of\nJoseph Sell; but I could see tolerably well with them, and they were not\nbleared.  I felt my arms, and thighs, and teeth--they were strong and\nsound enough; so now was the time to labour, to marry, eat strong flesh,\nand beget strong children--the power of doing all this would pass away\nwith youth, which was terribly transitory.  I bethought me that a time\nwould come when my eyes would be bleared, and, perhaps, sightless; my\narms and thighs strengthless and sapless; when my teeth would shake in my\njaws, even supposing they did not drop out.  No going a wooing then--no\nlabouring--no eating strong flesh, and begetting lusty children then; and\nI bethought me how, when all this should be, I should bewail the days of\nmy youth as misspent, provided I had not in them founded for myself a\nhome, and begotten strong children to take care of me in the days when I\ncould not take care of myself; and thinking of these things, I became\nsadder and sadder, and stared vacantly upon the fire till my eyes closed\nin a doze.\n\nI continued dozing over the fire, until rousing myself I perceived that\nthe brands were nearly consumed, and I thought of retiring for the night.\nI arose, and was about to enter my tent, when a thought struck me.\n\"Suppose,\" thought I, \"that Isopel Berners should return in the midst of\nthe night, how dark and dreary would the dingle appear without a fire!\ntruly, I will keep up the fire, and I will do more; I have no board to\nspread for her, but I will fill the kettle, and heat it, so that, if she\ncomes, I may be able to welcome her with a cup of tea, for I know she\nloves tea.\"  Thereupon, I piled more wood upon the fire, and soon\nsucceeded in procuring a better blaze than before; then, taking the\nkettle, I set out for the spring.  On arriving at the mouth of the\ndingle, which fronted the east, I perceived that Charles's wain was\nnearly opposite to it, high above in the heavens, by which I knew that\nthe night was tolerably well advanced.  The gypsy encampment lay before\nme; all was hushed and still within it, and its inmates appeared to be\nlocked in slumber; as I advanced, however, the dogs, which were fastened\noutside the tents, growled and barked; but presently recognising me, they\nwere again silent, some of them wagging their tails.  As I drew near a\nparticular tent, I heard a female voice say--\"Some one is coming!\" and,\nas I was about to pass it, the cloth which formed the door was suddenly\nlifted up, and a black head and part of a huge naked body protruded.  It\nwas the head and upper part of the giant Tawno, who, according to the\nfashion of gypsy men, lay next the door wrapped in his blanket; the\nblanket had, however, fallen off, and the starlight shone clear on his\nathletic tawny body, and was reflected from his large staring eyes.\n\n\"It is only I, Tawno,\" said I, \"going to fill the kettle, as it is\npossible that Miss Berners may arrive this night.\"  \"Kos-ko,\" drawled out\nTawno, and replaced the curtain.  \"Good, do you call it?\" said the sharp\nvoice of his wife; \"there is no good in the matter! if that young chap\nwere not living with the rawnee in the illegal and uncertificated line,\nhe would not be getting up in the middle of the night to fill her\nkettles.\"  Passing on, I proceeded to the spring, where I filled the\nkettle, and then returned to the dingle.\n\nPlacing the kettle upon the fire, I watched it till it began to boil;\nthen removing it from the top of the brands, I placed it close beside the\nfire, and leaving it simmering, I retired to my tent; where, having taken\noff my shoes, and a few of my garments, I lay down on my palliasse, and\nwas not long in falling asleep.  I believe I slept soundly for some time,\nthinking and dreaming of nothing; suddenly, however, my sleep became\ndisturbed, and the subject of the patterans began to occupy my brain.  I\nimagined that I saw Ursula tracing her husband, Launcelot Lovel, by means\nof his patterans; I imagined that she had considerable difficulty in\ndoing so; that she was occasionally interrupted by parish beadles and\nconstables, who asked her whither she was travelling, to whom she gave\nvarious answers.  Presently methought that, as she was passing by a farm-\nyard, two fierce and savage dogs flew at her; I was in great trouble, I\nremember, and wished to assist her, but could not, for though I seemed to\nsee her, I was still at a distance: and now it appeared that she had\nescaped from the dogs, and was proceeding with her cart along a gravelly\npath which traversed a wild moor; I could hear the wheels grating amidst\nsand and gravel.  The next moment I was awake, and found myself sitting\nup in my tent; there was a glimmer of light through the canvas caused by\nthe fire; a feeling of dread came over me, which was perhaps natural, on\nstarting suddenly from one's sleep in that wild lone place; I half\nimagined that some one was nigh the tent; the idea made me rather\nuncomfortable, and, to dissipate it, I lifted up the canvas of the door\nand peeped out, and, lo! I had a distinct view of a tall figure standing\nby the tent.  \"Who is that?\" said I, whilst I felt my blood rush to my\nheart.  \"It is I,\" said the voice of Isopel Berners; \"you little expected\nme, I dare say; well, sleep on, I do not wish to disturb you.\"  \"But I\nwas expecting you,\" said I, recovering myself, \"as you may see by the\nfire and kettle.  I will be with you in a moment.\"\n\nPutting on in haste the articles of dress which I had flung off, I came\nout of the tent, and addressing myself to Isopel, who was standing beside\nher cart, I said--\"just as I was about to retire to rest I thought it\npossible that you might come to-night, and got everything in readiness\nfor you.  Now, sit down by the fire whilst I lead the donkey and cart to\nthe place where you stay; I will unharness the animal, and presently come\nand join you.\"  \"I need not trouble you,\" said Isopel; \"I will go myself\nand see after my things.\"  \"We will go together,\" said I, \"and then\nreturn and have some tea.\"  Isopel made no objection, and in about half-\nan-hour we had arranged everything at her quarters, I then hastened and\nprepared tea.  Presently Isopel rejoined me, bringing her stool; she had\ndivested herself of her bonnet, and her hair fell over her shoulders; she\nsat down, and I poured out the beverage, handing her a cup.  \"Have you\nmade a long journey to-night?\" said I.  \"A very long one,\" replied Belle.\n\"I have come nearly twenty miles since six o'clock.\"  \"I believe I heard\nyou coming in my sleep,\" said I; \"did the dogs above bark at you?\"  \"Yes,\"\nsaid Isopel, \"very violently; did you think of me in your sleep?\"  \"No,\"\nsaid I, \"I was thinking of Ursula and something she had told me.\"  \"When\nand where was that?\" said Isopel.  \"Yesterday evening,\" said I, \"beneath\nthe dingle hedge.\"  \"Then you were talking with her beneath the hedge?\"\n\"I was,\" said I, \"but only upon gypsy matters.  Do you know, Belle, that\nshe has just been married to Sylvester, so that you need not think that\nshe and I--\"  \"She and you are quite at liberty to sit where you please,\"\nsaid Isopel.  \"However, young man,\" she continued, dropping her tone,\nwhich she had slightly raised, \"I believe what you said, that you were\nmerely talking about gypsy matters, and also what you were going to say,\nif it was, as I suppose, that she and you had no particular\nacquaintance.\"  Isopel was now silent for some time.  \"What are you\nthinking of?\" said I.  \"I was thinking,\" said Belle, \"how exceedingly\nkind it was of you to get everything in readiness for me, though you did\nnot know that I should come.\"  \"I had a presentiment that you would\ncome,\" said I; \"but you forget that I have prepared the kettle for you\nbefore, though it was true that I was then certain that you would come.\"\n\"I had not forgotten your doing so, young man,\" said Belle; \"but I was\nbeginning to think that you were utterly selfish, caring for nothing but\nthe gratification of your own selfish whims.\"  \"I am very fond of having\nmy own way,\" said I, \"but utterly selfish I am not, as I dare say I shall\nfrequently prove to you.  You will often find the kettle boiling when you\ncome home.\"  \"Not heated by you,\" said Isopel, with a sigh.  \"By whom\nelse?\" said I; \"surely you are not thinking of driving me away?\"  \"You\nhave as much right here as myself,\" said Isopel, \"as I have told you\nbefore; but I must be going myself.\"  \"Well,\" said I, \"we can go\ntogether; to tell you the truth, I am rather tired of this place.\"  \"Our\npaths must be separate,\" said Belle.  \"Separate,\" said I, \"what do you\nmean?  I shan't let you go alone, I shall go with you; and you know the\nroad is as free to me as to you; besides, you can't think of parting\ncompany with me, considering how much you would lose by doing so;\nremember that you know scarcely anything of the Armenian language; now,\nto learn Armenian from me would take you twenty years.\"\n\nBelle faintly smiled.  \"Come,\" said I, \"take another cup of tea.\"  Belle\ntook another cup of tea, and yet another; we had some indifferent\nconversation, after which I arose and gave her donkey a considerable feed\nof corn.  Belle thanked me, shook me by the hand, and then went to her\nown tabernacle, and I returned to mine.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nVisit to the Landlord--His Mortifications--Hunter and his\nClan--Resolution.\n\nOn the following morning, after breakfasting with Belle, who was silent\nand melancholy, I left her in the dingle, and took a stroll amongst the\nneighbouring lanes.  After some time I thought I would pay a visit to the\nlandlord of the public-house, whom I had not seen since the day when he\ncommunicated to me his intention of changing his religion.  I therefore\ndirected my steps to the house, and on entering it found the landlord\nstanding in the kitchen.  Just then two mean-looking fellows, who had\nbeen drinking at one of the tables, and who appeared to be the only\ncustomers in the house, got up, brushed past the landlord, and saying in\na surly tone, we shall pay you some time or other, took their departure.\n\"That's the way they serve me now,\" said the landlord, with a sigh.  \"Do\nyou know those fellows,\" I demanded, \"since you let them go away in your\ndebt?\"   \"I know nothing about them,\" said the landlord, \"save that they\nare a couple of scamps.\"  \"Then why did you let them go away without\npaying you?\" said I.  \"I had not the heart to stop them,\" said the\nlandlord; \"and, to tell you the truth, everybody serves me so now, and I\nsuppose they are right, for a child could flog me.\"  \"Nonsense,\" said I,\n\"behave more like a man, and with respect to those two fellows run after\nthem, I will go with you, and if they refuse to pay the reckoning I will\nhelp you to shake some money out of their clothes.\"  \"Thank you,\" said\nthe landlord; \"but as they are gone, let them go on.  What they have\ndrank is not of much consequence.\"  \"What is the matter with you?\" said\nI, staring at the landlord, who appeared strangely altered; his features\nwere wild and haggard, his formerly bluff cheeks were considerably sunken\nin, and his figure had lost much of its plumpness.  \"Have you changed\nyour religion already, and has the fellow in black commanded you to\nfast?\"  \"I have not changed my religion yet,\" said the landlord, with a\nkind of shudder; \"I am to change it publicly this day fortnight, and the\nidea of doing so--I do not mind telling you--preys much upon my mind;\nmoreover, the noise of the thing has got abroad, and everybody is\nlaughing at me, and what's more, coming and drinking my beer, and going\naway without paying for it, whilst I feel myself like one bewitched,\nwishing but not daring to take my own part.  Confound the fellow in\nblack, I wish I had never seen him! yet what can I do without him?  The\nbrewer swears that unless I pay him fifty pounds within a fortnight he'll\nsend a distress warrant into the house, and take all I have.  My poor\nniece is crying in the room above; and I am thinking of going into the\nstable and hanging myself; and perhaps it's the best thing I can do, for\nit's better to hang myself before selling my soul than afterwards, as I'm\nsure I should, like Judas Iscariot, whom my poor niece, who is somewhat\nreligiously inclined, has been talking to me about.\"  \"I wish I could\nassist you,\" said I, \"with money, but that is quite out of my power.\nHowever, I can give you a piece of advice.  Don't change your religion by\nany means; you can't hope to prosper if you do; and if the brewer chooses\nto deal hardly with you, let him.  Everybody would respect you ten times\nmore provided you allowed yourself to be turned into the roads rather\nthan change your religion, than if you got fifty pounds for renouncing\nit.\"  \"I am half inclined to take your advice,\" said the landlord, \"only,\nto tell you the truth, I feel quite low, without any heart in me.\"  \"Come\ninto the bar,\" said I, \"and let us have something together--you need not\nbe afraid of my not paying for what I order.\"\n\nWe went into the bar-room, where the landlord and I discussed between us\ntwo bottles of strong ale, which he said were part of the last six which\nhe had in his possession.  At first he wished to drink sherry, but I\nbegged him to do no such thing, telling him that sherry would do him no\ngood under the present circumstances; nor, indeed, to the best of my\nbelief, under any, it being of all wines the one for which I entertained\nthe most contempt.  The landlord allowed himself to be dissuaded, and,\nafter a glass or two of ale, confessed that sherry was a sickly,\ndisagreeable drink, and that he had merely been in the habit of taking it\nfrom an idea he had that it was genteel.  Whilst quaffing our beverage,\nhe gave me an account of the various mortifications to which he had of\nlate been subject, dwelling with particular bitterness on the conduct of\nHunter, who he said came every night and mouthed him, and afterwards went\naway without paying for what he had drank or smoked, in which conduct he\nwas closely imitated by a clan of fellows who constantly attended him.\nAfter spending several hours at the public-house I departed, not\nforgetting to pay for the two bottles of ale.  The landlord, before I\nwent, shaking me by the hand, declared that he had now made up his mind\nto stick to his religion at all hazards, the more especially as he was\nconvinced he should derive no good by giving it up.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nPreparations for the Fair--The Last Lesson--The Verb Siriel.\n\nIt might be about five in the evening, when I reached the gypsy\nencampment.  Here I found Mr. Petulengro, Tawno Chikno, Sylvester, and\nothers in a great bustle, clipping and trimming certain ponies and old\nhorses which they had brought with them.  On inquiring of Jasper the\nreason of their being so engaged, he informed me that they were getting\nthe horses ready for a fair, which was to be held on the morrow, at a\nplace some miles distant, at which they should endeavour to dispose of\nthem, adding--\"Perhaps, brother, you will go with us, provided you have\nnothing better to do?\"  Not having any particular engagement, I assured\nhim that I should have great pleasure in being of the party.  It was\nagreed that we should start early on the following morning.  Thereupon I\ndescended into the dingle.  Belle was sitting before the fire, at which\nthe kettle was boiling.  \"Were you waiting for me?\" I inquired.  \"Yes,\"\nsaid Belle, \"I thought that you would come, and I waited for you.\"  \"That\nwas very kind,\" said I.  \"Not half so kind,\" said she, \"as it was of you\nto get everything ready for me in the dead of last night, when there was\nscarcely a chance of my coming.\"  The tea-things were brought forward,\nand we sat down.  \"Have you been far?\" said Belle.  \"Merely to that\npublic-house,\" said I, \"to which you directed me on the second day of our\nacquaintance.\"  \"Young men should not make a habit of visiting public-\nhouses,\" said Belle, \"they are bad places.\"  \"They may be so to some\npeople,\" said I, \"but I do not think the worst public-house in England\ncould do me any harm.\"  \"Perhaps you are so bad already,\" said Belle,\nwith a smile, \"that it would be impossible to spoil you.\"  \"How dare you\ncatch at my words?\" said I; \"come, I will make you pay for doing so--you\nshall have this evening the longest lesson in Armenian which I have yet\ninflicted upon you.\"  \"You may well say inflicted,\" said Belle, \"but pray\nspare me.  I do not wish to hear anything about Armenian, especially this\nevening.\"  \"Why this evening?\" said I.  Belle made no answer.  \"I will\nnot spare you,\" said I; \"this evening I intend to make you conjugate an\nArmenian verb.\"  \"Well, be it so,\" said Belle; \"for this evening you\nshall command.\"  \"To command is hramahyel,\" said I.  \"Ram her ill,\nindeed,\" said Belle; \"I do not wish to begin with that.\"  \"No,\" said I,\n\"as we have come to the verbs, we will begin regularly; hramahyel is a\nverb of the second conjugation.  We will begin with the first.\"  \"First\nof all tell me,\" said Belle, \"what a verb is?\"  \"A part of speech,\" said\nI, \"which, according to the dictionary, signifies some action or passion;\nfor example, I command you, or I hate you.\"  \"I have given you no cause\nto hate me,\" said Belle, looking me sorrowfully in the face.\n\n\"I was merely giving two examples,\" said I, \"and neither was directed at\nyou.  In those examples, to command and hate are verbs.  Belle, in\nArmenian there are four conjugations of verbs; the first ends in al, the\nsecond in yel, the third in oul, and the fourth in il.  Now, have you\nunderstood me?\"\n\n\"I am afraid, indeed, it will all end ill,\" said Belle.\n\n\"Hold your tongue,\" said I, \"or you will make me lose my patience.\"  \"You\nhave already made me nearly lose mine,\" said Belle.  \"Let us have no\nunprofitable interruptions,\" said I; \"the conjugations of the Armenian\nverbs are neither so numerous nor so difficult as the declensions of the\nnouns; hear that, and rejoice.  Come, we will begin with the verb hntal,\na verb of the first conjugation, which signifies to rejoice.  Come along;\nhntam, I rejoice; hntas, thou rejoicest; why don't you follow, Belle?\"\n\n\"I am sure I don't rejoice, whatever you may do,\" said Belle.  \"The chief\ndifficulty, Belle,\" said I, \"that I find in teaching you the Armenian\ngrammar, proceeds from your applying to yourself and me every example I\ngive.  Rejoice, in this instance, is merely an example of an Armenian\nverb of the first conjugation, and has no more to do with your rejoicing\nthan lal, which is, also a verb of the first conjugation, and which\nsignifies to weep, would have to do with your weeping, provided I made\nyou conjugate it.  Come along; hntam, I rejoice; hntas, thou rejoicest;\nhnta, he rejoices; hntamk we rejoice: now, repeat those words.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" said Belle, \"they sound more like the language of horses than\nhuman beings.  Do you take me for--?\"  \"For what?\" said I.  Belle was\nsilent.  \"Were you going to say mare?\" said I.  \"Mare! mare! by the bye,\ndo you know, Belle, that mare in old English stands for woman; and that\nwhen we call a female an evil mare, the strict meaning of the term is\nmerely a bad woman.  So if I were to call you a mare without prefixing\nbad, you must not be offended.\"  \"But I should though,\" said Belle.  \"I\nwas merely attempting to make you acquainted with a philological fact,\"\nsaid I.  \"If mare, which in old English, and likewise in vulgar English,\nsignifies a woman, sounds the same as mare, which in modern and polite\nEnglish signifies a female horse, I can't help it.  There is no such\nconfusion of sounds in Armenian, not, at least, in the same instance.\nBelle, in Armenian, woman is ghin, the same word, by the by, as our\nqueen, whereas mare is madagh tzi, which signifies a female horse; and\nperhaps you will permit me to add, that a hard-mouthed jade is, in\nArmenian, madagh tzi hsdierah.\"\n\n\"I can't bear this much longer,\" said Belle.  \"Keep yourself quiet,\" said\nI; \"I wish to be gentle with you; and to convince you, we will skip\nhntal, and also for the present verbs of the first conjugation and\nproceed to the second.  Belle, I will now select for you to conjugate the\nprettiest verb in Armenian; not only of the second, but also of all the\nfour conjugations; that verb is siriel.  Here is the present\ntense:--siriem, siries, sire, siriemk, sirek, sirien.  You observe that\nit runs on just in the same manner as hntal, save and except that the e\nis substituted for a; and it will be as well to tell you that almost the\nonly difference between the second, third, and fourth conjugation, and\nthe first, is the substituting in the present, preterite and other tenses\ne or ou, or i for a; so you see that the Armenian verbs are by no means\ndifficult.  Come on, Belle, and say siriem.\"  Belle hesitated.  \"Pray\noblige me, Belle, by saying siriem!\"  Belle still appeared to hesitate.\n\"You must admit, Belle, that it is much softer than hntam.\"  \"It is so,\"\nsaid Belle; \"and to oblige you I will say siriem.\"  \"Very well indeed,\nBelle,\" said I. \"No vartabied, or doctor, could have pronounced it\nbetter; and now, to show you how verbs act upon pronouns in Armenian, I\nwill say siriem zkiez.  Please to repeat siriem zkiez!\"  \"Siriem zkiez!\"\nsaid Belle; \"that last word is very hard to say.\"  \"Sorry that you think\nso, Belle,\" said I.  \"Now please to say siria zis.\"  Belle did so.\n\"Exceedingly well,\" said I.  \"Now say, yerani the sireir zis.\"  \"Yerani\nthe sireir zis,\" said Belle.  \"Capital!\" said I; \"you have now said, I\nlove you--love me--ah! would that you would love me!\"\n\n\"And I have said all these things?\" said Belle.  \"Yes,\" said I; \"you have\nsaid them in Armenian.\"  \"I would have said them in no language that I\nunderstood,\" said Belle; \"and it was very wrong of you to take advantage\nof my ignorance, and make me say such things.\"  \"Why so?\" said I; \"if you\nsaid them, I said them too.\"  \"You did so,\" said Belle; \"but I believe\nyou were merely bantering and jeering.\"  \"As I told you before, Belle,\"\nsaid I, \"the chief difficulty which I find in teaching you Armenian\nproceeds from your persisting in applying to yourself and me every\nexample I give.\"  \"Then you meant nothing after all,\" said Belle, raising\nher voice.  \"Let us proceed,\" said I; \"sirietsi, I loved.\"  \"You never\nloved any one but yourself,\" said Belle; \"and what's more--\"  \"Sirietsits,\nI will love,\" said I; \"sirietsies, thou wilt love.\"  \"Never one so\nthoroughly heartless,\" said Belle.  \"I tell you what, Belle, you are\nbecoming intolerable, but we will change the verb; or rather I will now\nproceed to tell you here, that some of the Armenian conjugations have\ntheir anomalies; one species of these I wish to bring before your notice.\nAs old Villotte says--from whose work I first contrived to pick up the\nrudiments of Armenian--'Est verborum transitivorum, quorum infinitivus--'\nbut I forgot, you don't understand Latin.  He says there are certain\ntransitive verbs, whose infinitive is in outsaniel; the preterite in\noutsi; the imperative in one; for example--parghatsout-saniem, I\nirritate--\"\n\n\"You do, you do,\" said Belle; \"and it will be better for both of us, if\nyou leave off doing so.\"\n\n\"You would hardly believe, Belle,\" said I, \"that the Armenian is in some\nrespects closely connected with the Irish, but so it is; for example,\nthat word parghatsout-saniem is evidently derived from the same root as\nfeargaim, which, in Irish, is as much as to say I vex.\"\n\n\"You do, indeed,\" said Belle, sobbing.\n\n\"But how do you account for it?\"\n\n\"O man, man!\" said Belle, bursting into tears, \"for what purpose do you\nask a poor ignorant girl such a question, unless it be to vex and\nirritate her?  If you wish to display your learning, do so to the wise\nand instructed, and not to me, who can scarcely read or write.  Oh, leave\noff your nonsense; yet I know you will not do so, for it is the breath of\nyour nostrils!  I could have wished we should have parted in kindness,\nbut you will not permit it.  I have deserved better at your hands than\nsuch treatment.  The whole time we have kept company together in this\nplace, I have scarcely had one kind word from you, but the strangest--\"\nand here the voice of Belle was drowned in her sobs.\n\n\"I am sorry to see you take on so, dear Belle,\" said I.  \"I really have\ngiven you no cause to be so unhappy; surely teaching you a little\nArmenian was a very innocent kind of diversion.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you went on so long, and in such a strange way, and made me\nrepeat such strange examples, as you call them, that I could not bear\nit.\"\n\n\"Why, to tell you the truth, Belle, it's just my way; and I have dealt\nwith you just as I would with--\"\n\n\"A hard-mouthed jade,\" said Belle, \"and you practising your\nhorse-witchery upon her.  I have been of an unsubdued spirit, I\nacknowledge, but I was always kind to you; and if you have made me cry,\nit's a poor thing to boast of.\"\n\n\"Boast of!\" said I; \"a pretty thing indeed to boast of; I had no idea of\nmaking you cry.  Come, I beg your pardon; what more can I do?  Come,\ncheer up, Belle.  You were talking of parting; don't let us part, but\ndepart, and that together.\"\n\n\"Our ways lie different,\" said Belle.\n\n\"I don't see why they should,\" said I.  \"Come, let us be off to America\ntogether.\"\n\n\"To America together?\" said Belle, looking full at me.\n\n\"Yes,\" said I; \"where we will settle down in some forest, and conjugate\nthe verb siriel conjugally.\"\n\n\"Conjugally?\" said Belle.\n\n\"Yes,\" said I; \"as man and wife in America, air yew ghin.\"\n\n\"You are jesting, as usual,\" said Belle.\n\n\"Not I, indeed.  Come, Belle, make up your mind, and let us be off to\nAmerica; and leave priests, humbug, learning, and languages behind us.\"\n\n\"I don't think you are jesting,\" said Belle; \"but I can hardly entertain\nyour offers; however, young man, I thank you.\"\n\n\"You had better make up your mind at once,\" said I, \"and let us be off.  I\nshan't make a bad husband, I assure you.  Perhaps you think I am not\nworthy of you?  To convince you, Belle, that I am, I am ready to try a\nfall with you this moment upon the grass.  Brynhilda, the valkyrie, swore\nthat no one should ever marry her who could not fling her down.  Perhaps\nyou have done the same.  The man who eventually married her, got a friend\nof his, who was called Sygurd, the serpent-killer, to wrestle with her,\ndisguising him in his own armour.  Sygurd flung her down, and won her for\nhis friend, though he loved her himself.  I shall not use a similar\ndeceit, nor employ Jasper Petulengro to personate me--so get up, Belle,\nand I will do my best to fling you down.\"\n\n\"I require no such thing of you, or anybody,\" said Belle; \"you are\nbeginning to look rather wild.\"\n\n\"I every now and then do,\" said I; \"come, Belle, what do you say?\"\n\n\"I will say nothing at present on the subject,\" said Belle, \"I must have\ntime to consider.\"\n\n\"Just as you please,\" said I, \"to-morrow I go to a fair with Mr.\nPetulengro, perhaps you will consider whilst I am away.  Come, Belle, let\nus have some more tea.  I wonder whether we shall be able to procure tea\nas good as this in the American forest.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nThe Dawn of Day--The Last Farewell--Departure for the Fair--The Fine\nHorse--Return to the Dingle--No Isopel.\n\nIt was about the dawn of day when I was awakened by the voice of Mr.\nPetulengro shouting from the top of the dingle, and bidding me get up.  I\narose instantly, and dressed myself for the expedition to the fair.  On\nleaving my tent, I was surprised to observe Belle, entirely dressed,\nstanding close to her own little encampment.  \"Dear me,\" said I, \"I\nlittle expected to find you up so early.  I suppose Jasper's call\nawakened you, as it did me.\"  \"I merely lay down in my things,\" said\nBelle, \"and have not slept during the night.\"  \"And why did you not take\noff your things and go to sleep?\" said I.  \"I did not undress,\" said\nBelle, \"because I wished to be in readiness to bid you farewell when you\ndeparted; and as for sleeping, I could not.\"  \"Well, God bless you!\" said\nI, taking Belle by the hand.  Belle made no answer, and I observed that\nher hand was very cold.  \"What is the matter with you?\" said I, looking\nher in the face.  Belle looked at me for a moment in the eyes--and then\ncast down her own--her features were very pale.  \"You are really unwell,\"\nsaid I, \"I had better not go to the fair, but stay here, and take care of\nyou.\"  \"No,\" said Belle, \"pray go, I am not unwell.\"  \"Then go to your\ntent,\" said I, \"and do not endanger your health by standing abroad in the\nraw morning air.  God bless you, Belle.  I shall be home to-night, by\nwhich time I expect you will have made up your mind; if not, another\nlesson in Armenian, however late the hour be.\"  I then wrung Belle's\nhand, and ascended to the plain above.\n\nI found the Romany party waiting for me, and everything in readiness for\ndeparting.  Mr. Petulengro and Tawno Chikno were mounted on two old\nhorses.  The rest, who intended to go to the fair, amongst whom were two\nor three women, were on foot.  On arriving at the extremity of the plain,\nI looked towards the dingle.  Isopel Berners stood at the mouth, the\nbeams of the early morning sun shone full on her noble face and figure.  I\nwaved my hand towards her.  She slowly lifted up her right arm.  I turned\naway, and never saw Isopel Berners again.\n\nMy companions and myself proceeded on our way.  In about two hours we\nreached the place where the fair was to be held.  After breakfasting on\nbread and cheese and ale behind a broken stone wall, we drove our animals\nto the fair.  The fair was a common cattle and horse fair: there was\nlittle merriment going on, but there was no lack of business.  By about\ntwo o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Petulengro and his people had disposed\nof their animals at what they conceived very fair prices--they were all\nin high spirits, and Jasper proposed to adjourn to a public-house.  As we\nwere proceeding to one, a very fine horse, led by a jockey, made its\nappearance on the ground.  Mr. Petulengro stopped short, and looked at it\nstedfastly: \"Fino covar dove odoy sas miro--a fine thing were that if it\nwere but mine!\" he exclaimed.  \"If you covet it,\" said I, \"why do you not\npurchase it?\"  \"We low 'Gyptians never buy animals of that description;\nif we did we could never sell them, and most likely should be had up as\nhorse-stealers.\"  \"Then why did you say just now, 'It were a fine thing\nif it were but yours?'\" said I.  \"We 'Gyptians always say so when we see\nanything that we admire.  An animal like that is not intended for a\nlittle hare like me, but for some grand gentleman like yourself.  I say,\nbrother, do you buy that horse!\"  \"How should I buy the horse, you\nfoolish person?\" said I.  \"Buy the horse, brother,\" said Mr. Petulengro,\n\"if you have not the money I can lend it you, though I be of lower\nEgypt.\"  \"You talk nonsense,\" said I; \"however, I wish you would ask the\nman the price of it.\"   Mr. Petulengro, going up to the jockey, inquired\nthe price of the horse--the man, looking at him scornfully, made no\nreply.  \"Young man,\" said I, going up to the jockey, \"do me the favour to\ntell me the price of that horse, as I suppose it is to sell.\"  The\njockey, who was a surly-looking man, of about fifty, looked at me for a\nmoment, then, after some hesitation, said, laconically, \"Seventy.\"  \"Thank\nyou,\" said I, and turned away.  \"Buy that horse,\" said Mr. Petulengro,\ncoming after me; \"the dook tells me that in less than three months he\nwill be sold for twice seventy.\"  \"I will have nothing to do with him,\"\nsaid I; \"besides, Jasper, I don't like his tail.  Did you observe what a\nmean scrubby tail he has?\"  \"What a fool you are, brother,\" said Mr.\nPetulengro; \"that very tail of his shows his breeding.  No good bred\nhorse ever yet carried a fine tail--'tis your scrubby-tailed horses that\nare your out-and-outers.  Did you ever hear of Syntax, brother?  That\ntail of his puts me in mind of Syntax.  Well, I say nothing more, have\nyour own way--all I wonder at is, that a horse like him was ever brought\nto such a fair of dog cattle as this.\"\n\nWe then made the best of our way to a public-house, where we had some\nrefreshment.  I then proposed returning to the encampment, but Mr.\nPetulengro declined, and remained drinking with his companions till about\nsix o'clock in the evening, when various jockeys from the fair came in.\nAfter some conversation a jockey proposed a game of cards; and in a\nlittle time, Mr. Petulengro and another gypsy sat down to play a game of\ncards with two of the jockeys.\n\nThough not much acquainted with cards, I soon conceived a suspicion that\nthe jockeys were cheating Mr. Petulengro and his companion, I therefore\ncalled Mr. Petulengro aside, and gave him a hint to that effect.  Mr.\nPetulengro, however, instead of thanking me, told me to mind my own bread\nand butter, and forthwith returned to his game.  I continued watching the\nplayers for some hours.  The gypsies lost considerably, and I saw clearly\nthat the jockeys were cheating them most confoundedly.  I therefore once\nmore called Mr. Petulengro aside, and told him that the jockeys were\ncheating him, conjuring him to return to the encampment.  Mr. Petulengro,\nwho was by this time somewhat the worse for liquor, now fell into a\npassion, swore several oaths, and asking me who had made me a Moses over\nhim and his brethren, told me to return to the encampment by myself.\nIncensed at the unworthy return which my well-meant words had received, I\nforthwith left the house, and having purchased a few articles of\nprovision, I set out for the dingle alone.  It was a dark night when I\nreached it, and descending I saw the glimmer of a fire from the depths of\nthe dingle; my heart beat with fond anticipation of a welcome.  \"Isopel\nBerners is waiting for me,\" said I, \"and the first words that I shall\nhear from her lips is that she has made up her mind.  We shall go to\nAmerica, and be so happy together.\"  On reaching the bottom of the\ndingle, however, I saw seated near the fire, beside which stood the\nkettle simmering, not Isopel Berners, but a gypsy girl, who told me that\nMiss Berners when she went away had charged her to keep up the fire, and\nhave the kettle boiling against my arrival.  Startled at these words, I\ninquired at what hour Isopel had left, and whither she was gone, and was\ntold that she had left the dingle, with her cart, about two hours after I\ndeparted; but where she was gone she, the girl, did not know.  I then\nasked whether she had left no message, and the girl replied that she had\nleft none, but had merely given directions about the kettle and fire,\nputting, at the same time, six-pence into her hand.  \"Very strange,\"\nthought I; then dismissing the gypsy girl I sat down by the fire.  I had\nno wish for tea, but sat looking on the embers, wondering what could be\nthe motive of the sudden departure of Isopel.  \"Does she mean to return?\"\nthought I to myself.  \"Surely she means to return,\" Hope replied, \"or she\nwould not have gone away without leaving any message\"--\"and yet she could\nscarcely mean to return,\" muttered Foreboding, \"or she assuredly would\nhave left some message with the girl.\"  I then thought to myself what a\nhard thing it would be, if, after having made up my mind to assume the\nyoke of matrimony, I should be disappointed of the woman of my choice.\n\"Well, after all,\" thought I, \"I can scarcely be disappointed; if such an\nugly scoundrel as Sylvester had no difficulty in getting such a nice wife\nas Ursula, surely I, who am not a tenth part so ugly, cannot fail to\nobtain the hand of Isopel Berners, uncommonly fine damsel though she be.\nHusbands do not grow upon hedgerows; she is merely gone after a little\nbusiness and will return to-morrow.\"\n\nComforted in some degree by these hopeful imaginings, I retired to my\ntent, and went to sleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nGloomy Forebodings--The Postman's Mother--The Letter--Bears and\nBarons--The Best of Advice.\n\nNothing occurred to me of any particular moment during the following day.\nIsopel Berners did not return; but Mr. Petulengro and his companions came\nhome from the fair early in the morning.  When I saw him, which was about\nmidday, I found him with his face bruised and swelled.  It appeared that,\nsome time after I had left him, he himself perceived that the jockeys\nwith whom he was playing cards were cheating him and his companion; a\nquarrel ensued, which terminated in a fight between Mr. Petulengro and\none of the jockeys, which lasted some time, and in which Mr. Petulengro,\nthough he eventually came off victor, was considerably beaten.  His\nbruises, in conjunction with his pecuniary loss, which amounted to about\nseven pounds, were the cause of his being much out of humour; before\nnight, however, he had returned to his usual philosophic frame of mind,\nand, coming up to me as I was walking about, apologized for his behaviour\non the preceding day, and assured me that he was determined, from that\ntime forward, never to quarrel with a friend for giving him good advice.\n\nTwo more days passed, and still Isopel Berners did not return.  Gloomy\nthoughts and forebodings filled my mind.  During the day I wandered about\nthe neighbouring roads in the hopes of catching an early glimpse of her\nand her returning vehicle; and at night lay awake, tossing about on my\nhard couch, listening to the rustle of every leaf, and occasionally\nthinking that I heard the sound of her wheels upon the distant road.  Once\nat midnight, just as I was about to fall into unconsciousness, I suddenly\nstarted up, for I was convinced that I heard the sound of wheels.  I\nlistened most anxiously, and the sound of wheels striking against stones\nwas certainly plain enough.  \"She comes at last,\" thought I, and for a\nfew moments I felt as if a mountain had been removed from my\nbreast;--\"here she comes at last, now, how shall I receive her?  Oh,\"\nthought I, \"I will receive her rather coolly, just as if I was not\nparticularly anxious about her--that's the way to manage these women.\"\nThe next moment the sound became very loud, rather too loud, I thought,\nto proceed from her wheels, and then by degrees became fainter.  Rushing\nout of my tent, I hurried up the path to the top of the dingle, where I\nheard the sound distinctly enough, but it was going from me, and\nevidently proceeded from something much larger than the cart of Isopel.  I\ncould, moreover, hear the stamping of a horse's hoof at a lumbering trot.\nThose only whose hopes have been wrought up to a high pitch, and then\nsuddenly cast down, can imagine what I felt at that moment; and yet when\nI returned to my lonely tent, and lay down on my hard pallet, the voice\nof conscience told me that the misery I was then undergoing I had fully\nmerited, for the unkind manner in which I had intended to receive her,\nwhen for a brief moment I supposed that she had returned.\n\nIt was on the morning after this affair, and the fourth, if I forget not,\nfrom the time of Isopel's departure, that, as I was seated on my stone at\nthe bottom of the dingle, getting my breakfast, I heard an unknown voice\nfrom the path above--apparently that of a person descending--exclaim,\n\"Here's a strange place to bring a letter to;\" and presently an old\nwoman, with a belt round her middle, to which was attached a leathern\nbag, made her appearance, and stood before me.\n\n\"Well, if I ever!\" said she, as she looked about her.  \"My good\ngentlewoman,\" said I, \"pray what may you please to want?\"  \"Gentlewoman!\"\nsaid the old dame, \"please to want--well, I call that speaking civilly,\nat any rate.  It is true, civil words cost nothing; nevertheless, we do\nnot always get them.  What I please to want is to deliver a letter to a\nyoung man in this place; perhaps you be he?\"  \"What's the name on the\nletter?\" said I, getting up, and going to her.  \"There's no name upon\nit,\" said she, taking a letter out of her scrip, and looking at it.  \"It\nis directed to the young man in Mumper's Dingle.\"  \"Then it is for me, I\nmake no doubt,\" said I, stretching out my hand to take it.  \"Please to\npay me ninepence first,\" said the old woman.  \"However,\" said she, after\na moment's thought, \"civility is civility, and, being rather a scarce\narticle, should meet with some return.  Here's the letter, young man, and\nI hope you will pay for it; for if you do not I must pay the postage\nmyself.\"  \"You are the postwoman, I suppose,\" said I, as I took the\nletter.  \"I am the postman's mother,\" said the old woman; \"but as he has\na wide beat, I help him as much as I can, and I generally carry letters\nto places like this, to which he is afraid to come himself.\"  \"You say\nthe postage is ninepence,\" said I, \"here's a shilling.\"  \"Well, I call\nthat honourable,\" said the old woman, taking the shilling, and putting it\ninto her pocket--\"here's your change, young man,\" said she, offering me\nthreepence.  \"Pray keep that for yourself,\" said I; \"you deserve it for\nyour trouble.\"  \"Well, I call that genteel,\" said the old woman; \"and as\none good turn deserves another, since you look as if you couldn't read, I\nwill read your letter for you.  Let's see it; it's from some young woman\nor other, I dare say.\"  \"Thank you,\" said I, \"but I can read.\"  \"All the\nbetter for you,\" said the old woman; \"your being able to read will\nfrequently save you a penny, for that's the charge I generally make for\nreading letters; though, as you behaved so genteelly to me, I should have\ncharged you nothing.  Well, if you can read, why don't you open the\nletter, instead of keeping it hanging between your finger and thumb?\"  \"I\nam in no hurry to open it,\" said I, with a sigh.  The old woman looked at\nme for a moment--\"Well, young man,\" said she, \"there are some--especially\nthose who can read--who don't like to open their letters when anybody is\nby, more especially when they come from young women.  Well, I won't\nintrude upon you, but leave you alone with your letter.  I wish it may\ncontain something pleasant.  God bless you,\" and with these words she\ndeparted.\n\nI sat down on my stone, with my letter in my hand.  I knew perfectly well\nthat it could have come from no other person than Isopel Berners; but\nwhat did the letter contain?  I guessed tolerably well what its purport\nwas--an eternal farewell! yet I was afraid to open the letter, lest my\nexpectation should be confirmed.  There I sat with the letter, putting\noff the evil moment as long as possible.  At length I glanced at the\ndirection, which was written in a fine bold hand, and was directed, as\nthe old woman had said, to the young man in \"Mumpers' Dingle,\" with the\naddition, near ---, in the county of-- Suddenly the idea occurred to me,\nthat, after all, the letter might not contain an eternal farewell; and\nthat Isopel might have written, requesting me to join her.  Could it be\nso?  \"Alas! no,\" presently said Foreboding.  At last I became ashamed of\nmy weakness.  The letter must be opened sooner or later.  Why not at\nonce?  So as the bather who, for a considerable time, has stood shivering\non the bank, afraid to take the decisive plunge, suddenly takes it, I\ntore open the letter almost before I was aware.  I had no sooner done so\nthan a paper fell out.  I examined it; it contained a lock of bright\nflaxen hair.  \"This is no good sign,\" said I, as I thrust the lock and\npaper into my bosom, and proceeded to read the letter, which ran as\nfollows:--\n\n   \"TO THE YOUNG MAN IN MUMPERS' DINGLE.\n\n   \"SIR,--I send these lines, with the hope and trust that they will find\n   you well, even as I am myself at this moment, and in much better\n   spirits, for my own are not such as I could wish they were, being\n   sometimes rather hysterical and vapourish, and at other times, and\n   most often, very low.  I am at a sea-port, and am just going on\n   shipboard; and when you get these I shall be on the salt waters, on my\n   way to a distant country, and leaving my own behind me, which I do not\n   expect ever to see again.\n\n   \"And now, young man, I will, in the first place, say something about\n   the manner in which I quitted you.  It must have seemed somewhat\n   singular to you that I went away without taking any leave, or giving\n   you the slightest hint that I was going; but I did not do so without\n   considerable reflection.  I was afraid that I should not be able to\n   support a leave-taking; and as you had said that you were determined\n   to go wherever I did, I thought it best not to tell you at all; for I\n   did not think it advisable that you should go with me, and I wished to\n   have no dispute.\n\n   \"In the second place, I wish to say something about an offer of\n   wedlock which you made me; perhaps, young man, had you made it at the\n   first period of our acquaintance, I should have accepted it, but you\n   did not, and kept putting off and putting off, and behaving in a very\n   strange manner, till I could stand your conduct no longer, but\n   determined upon leaving you and Old England, which last step I had\n   been long thinking about; so when you made your offer at last,\n   everything was arranged--my cart and donkey engaged to be sold--and\n   the greater part of my things disposed of.  However, young man, when\n   you did make it, I frankly tell you that I had half a mind to accept\n   it; at last, however, after very much consideration, I thought it best\n   to leave you for ever, because, for some time past, I had become\n   almost convinced, that though with a wonderful deal of learning, and\n   exceedingly shrewd in some things, you were--pray don't be offended--at\n   the root mad! and though mad people, I have been told, sometimes make\n   very good husbands, I was unwilling that your friends, if you had any,\n   should say that Belle Berners, the workhouse girl, took advantage of\n   your infirmity; for there is no concealing that I was born and bred up\n   in a workhouse; notwithstanding that, my blood is better than your\n   own, and as good as the best; you having yourself told me that my name\n   is a noble name, and once, if I mistake not, that it was the same word\n   as baron, which is the same thing as bear; and that to be called in\n   old times a bear was considered a great compliment--the bear being a\n   mighty strong animal, on which account our forefathers called all\n   their great fighting-men barons, which is the same as bears.\n\n   \"However, setting matters of blood and family entirely aside, many\n   thanks to you, young man, from poor Belle, for the honour you did her\n   in making that same offer; for, after all, it is an honour to receive\n   an honourable offer, which she could see clearly yours was, with no\n   floriness nor chaff in it; but, on the contrary, entire sincerity.  She\n   assures you that she shall always bear it and yourself in mind,\n   whether on land or water; and as a proof of the good-will she bears to\n   you, she sends you a lock of the hair which she wears on her head,\n   which you were often looking at, and were pleased to call flax, which\n   word she supposes you meant as a compliment, even as the old people\n   meant to pass a compliment to their great folks, when they called them\n   bears; though she cannot help thinking that they might have found an\n   animal as strong as a bear, and somewhat less uncouth, to call their\n   great folks after: even as she thinks yourself, amongst your great\n   store of words, might have found something a little more genteel to\n   call her hair after than flax, which, though strong and useful, is\n   rather a coarse and common kind of article.\n\n   \"And as another proof of the good-will she bears to you, she sends\n   you, along with the lock, a piece of advice, which is worth all the\n   hair in the world, to say nothing of the flax.\n\n   \"_Fear God_, and take your own part.  There's Bible in that, young\n   man: see how Moses feared God, and how he took his own part against\n   everybody who meddled with him.  And see how David feared God, and\n   took his own part against all the bloody enemies which surrounded\n   him--so fear God, young man, and never give in!  The world can bully,\n   and is fond, provided it sees a man in a kind of difficulty, of\n   getting about him, calling him coarse names, and even going so far as\n   to hustle him: but the world, like all bullies, carries a white\n   feather in its tail, and no sooner sees the man taking off his coat,\n   and offering to fight its best, than it scatters here and there, and\n   is always civil to him afterwards.  So when folks are disposed to ill-\n   treat you, young man, say, 'Lord have mercy upon me!' and then tip\n   them to Long Melford, which, as the saying goes, there is nothing\n   comparable for shortness all the world over; and these last words,\n   young man, are the last you will ever have from her who is\n   nevertheless,\n\n   \"Your affectionate female servant,\n   \"ISOPEL BERNERS.\"\n\nAfter reading the letter I sat for some time motionless, holding it in my\nhand.  The daydream in which I had been a little time before indulging,\nof marrying Isopel Berners, of going with her to America, and having by\nher a large progeny, who were to assist me in felling trees, cultivating\nthe soil, and who would take care of me when I was old, was now\nthoroughly dispelled.  Isopel had deserted me, and was gone to America by\nherself, where, perhaps, she would marry some other person, and would\nbear him a progeny, who would do for him what in my dream I had hoped my\nprogeny by her would do for me.  Then the thought came into my head that\nthough she was gone, I might follow her to America, but then I thought\nthat if I did I might not find her; America was a very large place, and I\ndid not know the port to which she was bound; but I could follow her to\nthe port from which she had sailed, and there possibly discover the port\nto which she was bound; but I did not even know the port from which she\nhad set out, for Isopel had not dated her letter from any place.  Suddenly\nit occurred to me that the post-mark on the letter would tell me from\nwhence it came, so I forthwith looked at the back of the letter, and in\nthe post-mark read the name of a well-known and not very distant\nsea-port.  I then knew with tolerable certainty the port where she had\nembarked, and I almost determined to follow her, but I almost instantly\ndetermined to do no such thing.  Isopel Berners had abandoned me, and I\nwould not follow her; \"Perhaps,\" whispered Pride, \"if I overtook her, she\nwould only despise me for running after her;\" and it also told me pretty\nroundly, provided I ran after her, whether I overtook her or not, I\nshould heartily despise myself.  So I determined not to follow Isopel\nBerners; I took her lock of hair, and looked at it, then put it in her\nletter, which I folded up and carefully stowed away, resolved to keep\nboth for ever, but I determined not to follow her.  Two or three times,\nhowever, during the day, I wavered in my determination, and was again and\nagain almost tempted to follow her, but every succeeding time the\ntemptation was fainter.  In the evening I left the dingle, and sat down\nwith Mr. Petulengro and his family by the door of his tent; Mr.\nPetulengro soon began talking of the letter which I had received in the\nmorning.  \"Is it not from Miss Berners, brother?\" said he.  I told him it\nwas.  \"Is she coming back, brother?\"  \"Never,\" said I; \"she is gone to\nAmerica, and has deserted me.\"  \"I always knew that you two were never\ndestined for each other,\" said he.  \"How did you know that?\" I inquired.\n\"The dook told me so, brother; you are born to be a great traveller.\"\n\"Well,\" said I, \"if I had gone with her to America, as I was thinking of\ndoing, I should have been a great traveller.\"  \"You are to travel in\nanother direction, brother,\" said he.  \"I wish you would tell me all\nabout my future wanderings,\" said I.  \"I can't, brother,\" said Mr.\nPetulengro, \"there's a power of clouds before my eye.\"  \"You are a poor\nseer, after all,\" said I; and getting up, I retired to my dingle and my\ntent, where I betook myself to my bed, and there, knowing the worst, and\nbeing no longer agitated by apprehension, nor agonized by expectation, I\nwas soon buried in a deep slumber, the first which I had fallen into for\nseveral nights.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nThe Public-house--Landlord on His Legs Again--A Blow in Season--The Way\nof the World--The Grateful Mind--The Horse's Neigh.\n\nIt was rather late on the following morning when I awoke.  At first I was\nalmost unconscious of what had occurred on the preceding day;\nrecollection, however, by degrees returned, and I felt a deep melancholy\ncoming over me, but perfectly aware that no advantage could be derived\nfrom the indulgence of such a feeling, I sprang up, prepared my\nbreakfast, which I ate with a tolerable appetite, and then left the\ndingle, and betook myself to the gypsy encampment, where I entered into\ndiscourse with various Romanies, both male and female.  After some time,\nfeeling myself in better spirits, I determined to pay another visit to\nthe landlord of the public-house.  From the position of his affairs when\nI had last visited him I entertained rather gloomy ideas with respect to\nhis present circumstances.  I imagined that I should either find him\nalone in his kitchen smoking a wretched pipe, or in company with some\nsurly bailiff or his follower, whom his friend the brewer had sent into\nthe house in order to take possession of his effects.\n\nNothing more entirely differing from either of these anticipations could\nhave presented itself to my view than what I saw about one o'clock in the\nafternoon, when I entered the house.  I had come, though somewhat in want\nof consolation myself, to offer any consolation which was at my command\nto my acquaintance Catchpole, and perhaps like many other people who go\nto a house with \"drops of compassion trembling on their eyelids,\" I felt\nrather disappointed at finding that no compassion was necessary.  The\nhouse was thronged with company, and cries for ale and porter, hot brandy\nand water, cold gin and water, were numerous; moreover, no desire to\nreceive and not to pay for the landlord's liquids was manifested--on the\ncontrary, everybody seemed disposed to play the most honourable part:\n\"Landlord, here's the money for this glass of brandy and water--do me the\nfavour to take it; all right, remember I have paid you.\"  \"Landlord,\nhere's the money for the pint of half-and-half-fourpence halfpenny, ain't\nit?--here's sixpence; keep the change--confound the change!\"  The\nlandlord, assisted by his niece, bustled about; his brow erect, his\ncheeks plumped out, and all his features exhibiting a kind of surly\nsatisfaction.  Wherever he moved, marks of the most cordial amity were\nshown him, hands were thrust out to grasp his, nor were looks of respect,\nadmiration, nay, almost of adoration, wanting.  I observed one fellow, as\nthe landlord advanced, take the pipe out of his mouth, and gaze upon him\nwith a kind of grin of wonder, probably much the same as his ancestor,\nthe Saxon lout of old, put on when he saw his idol Thur, dressed in a new\nkirtle.  To avoid the press, I got into a corner, where on a couple of\nchairs sat two respectable-looking individuals, whether farmers or sow-\ngelders, I know not, but highly respectable-looking, who were discoursing\nabout the landlord.  \"Such another,\" said one, \"you will not find in a\nsummer's day.\"  \"No, nor in the whole of England,\" said the other.  \"Tom\nof Hopton,\" said the first: \"ah!  Tom of Hopton,\" echoed the other; \"the\nman who could beat Tom of Hopton could beat the world.\"  \"I glory in\nhim,\" said the first.  \"So do I,\" said the second, \"I'll back him against\nthe world.  Let me hear any one say anything against him, and if I\ndon't--\" then, looking at me, he added, \"have you anything to say against\nhim, young man?\"  \"Not a word,\" said I, \"save that he regularly puts me\nout.\"  \"He'll put any one out,\" said the man, \"any one out of conceit\nwith himself;\" then, lifting a mug to his mouth, he added, with a\nhiccough, \"I drink his health.\"  Presently the landlord, as he moved\nabout, observing me, stopped short: \"Ah!\" said he, \"are you here?  I am\nglad to see you, come this way.  Stand back,\" said he to his company, as\nI followed him to the bar, \"stand back for me and this gentleman.\"  Two\nor three young fellows were in the bar, seemingly sporting yokels,\ndrinking sherry and smoking.  \"Come, gentlemen,\" said the landlord,\n\"clear the bar, I must have a clear bar for me and my friend here.\"\n\"Landlord, what will you take,\" said one, \"a glass of sherry?  I know you\nlike it.\"  \"- sherry and you too,\" said the landlord, \"I want neither\nsherry nor yourself; didn't you hear what I told you?\"  \"All right, old\nfellow,\" said the other, shaking the landlord by the hand, \"all right,\ndon't wish to intrude--but I suppose when you and your friend have done,\nI may come in again;\" then, with a \"sarvant, sir,\" to me, he took himself\ninto the kitchen, followed by the rest of the sporting yokels.\n\nThereupon the landlord, taking a bottle of ale from a basket, uncorked\nit, and pouring the contents into two large glasses, handed me one, and\nmotioning me to sit down, placed himself by me; then, emptying his own\nglass at a draught, he gave a kind of grunt of satisfaction, and fixing\nhis eyes upon the opposite side of the bar, remained motionless, without\nsaying a word, buried apparently in important cogitations.  With respect\nto myself, I swallowed my ale more leisurely, and was about to address my\nfriend, when his niece, coming into the bar, said that more and more\ncustomers were arriving, and how she should supply their wants she did\nnot know, unless her uncle would get and help her.\n\n\"The customers!\" said the landlord, \"let the scoundrels wait till you\nhave time to serve them, or till I have leisure to see after them.\"  \"The\nkitchen won't contain half of them,\" said his niece.  \"Then let them sit\nout abroad,\" said the landlord.  \"But there are not benches enough,\nuncle,\" said the niece.  \"Then let them stand or sit on the ground,\" said\nthe uncle, \"what care I; I'll let them know that the man who beat Tom of\nHopton stands as well again on his legs as ever.\"  Then opening a side\ndoor which led from the bar into the back yard, he beckoned me to follow\nhim.  \"You treat your customers in rather a cavalier manner,\" said I,\nwhen we were alone together in the yard.\n\n\"Don't I?\" said the landlord; \"and I'll treat them more so yet; now I\nhave got the whiphand of the rascals I intend to keep it.  I dare say you\nare a bit surprised with regard to the change which has come over things\nsince you were last here.  I'll tell you how it happened.  You remember\nin what a desperate condition you found me, thinking of changing my\nreligion, selling my soul to the man in black, and then going and hanging\nmyself like Pontius Pilate; and I dare say you can't have forgotten how\nyou gave me good advice, made me drink ale, and give up sherry.  Well,\nafter you were gone, I felt all the better for your talk, and what you\nhad made me drink, and it was a mercy that I did feel better; for my\nniece was gone out, poor thing, and I was left alone in the house,\nwithout a soul to look at, or to keep me from doing myself a mischief in\ncase I was so inclined.  Well, things wore on in this way till it grew\ndusk, when in came that blackguard Hunter with his train to drink at my\nexpense, and to insult me as usual; there were more than a dozen of them,\nand a pretty set they looked.  Well, they ordered about in a very free\nand easy manner for upwards of an hour and a half, occasionally sneering\nand jeering at me, as they had been in the habit of doing for some time\npast; so, as I said before, things wore on, and other customers came in,\nwho, though they did not belong to Hunter's gang, also passed off their\njokes upon me; for, as you perhaps know, we English are a set of low\nhounds, who will always take part with the many by way of making\nourselves safe, and currying favour with the stronger side.  I said\nlittle or nothing, for my spirits had again become very low, and I was\nverily scared and afraid.  All of a sudden I thought of the ale which I\nhad drank in the morning, and of the good it did me then, so I went into\nthe bar, opened another bottle, took a glass, and felt better; so I took\nanother, and feeling better still, I went back into the kitchen, just as\nHunter and his crew were about leaving.  'Mr. Hunter,' said I, 'you and\nyour people will please to pay me for what you have had?'  'What do you\nmean by my people?' said he, with an oath.  'Ah, what do you mean by\ncalling us his people?' said the clan.  'We are nobody's people;' and\nthen there was a pretty load of abuse, and threatening to serve me out.\n'Well,' said I, 'I was perhaps wrong to call them your people, and beg\nyour pardon and theirs.  And now you will please to pay me for what you\nhave had yourself, and afterwards I can settle with them.'  'I shall pay\nyou when I think fit,' said Hunter.  'Yes,' said the rest, 'and so shall\nwe.  We shall pay you when we think fit.'  'I tell you what,' said\nHunter, 'I conceives I do such an old fool as you an honour when I comes\ninto his house and drinks his beer, and goes away without paying for it;'\nand then there was a roar of laughter from everybody, and almost all said\nthe same thing.  'Now do you please to pay me, Mr. Hunter?' said I.  'Pay\nyou!' said Hunter; 'pay you!  Yes, here's the pay;' and thereupon he held\nout his thumb, twirling it round till it just touched my nose.  I can't\ntell you what I felt that moment; a kind of madhouse thrill came upon me,\nand all I know is, that I bent back as far as I could, then lunging out,\nstruck him under the ear, sending him reeling two or three yards, when he\nfell on the floor.  I wish you had but seen how my company looked at me\nand at each other.  One or two of the clan went to raise Hunter, and get\nhim to fight, but it was no go; though he was not killed, he had had\nenough for that evening.  Oh, I wish you had seen my customers; those who\ndid not belong to the clan, but who had taken part with them, and helped\nto jeer and flout me, now came and shook me by the hand, wishing me joy,\nand saying as, how 'I was a brave fellow, and had served the bully\nright!'  As for the clan, they all said Hunter was bound to do me\njustice; so they made him pay me what he owed for himself, and the\nreckoning of those among them who said they had no money.  Two or three\nof them then led him away, while the rest stayed behind, and flattered\nme, and worshipped me, and called Hunter all kinds of dogs' names.  What\ndo you think of that?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said I, \"it makes good what I read in a letter which I received\nyesterday.  It is just the way of the world.\"\n\n\"A'n't it,\" said the landlord.  \"Well, that a'n't all; let me go on.  Good\nfortune never yet came alone.  In about an hour comes home my poor niece,\nalmost in high sterricks with joy, smiling and sobbing.  She had been to\nthe clergyman of M---, the great preacher, to whose church she was in the\nhabit of going, and to whose daughters she was well known; and to him she\ntold a lamentable tale about my distresses, and about the snares which\nhad been laid for my soul; and so well did she plead my cause, and so\nstrong did the young ladies back all she said, that the good clergyman\npromised to stand my friend, and to lend me sufficient money to satisfy\nthe brewer, and to get my soul out of the snares of the man in black; and\nsure enough the next morning the two young ladies brought me the fifty\npounds, which I forthwith carried to the brewer, who was monstrously\ncivil, saying that he hoped any little misunderstanding we had had would\nnot prevent our being good friends in future.  That a'n't all; the people\nof the neighbouring county hearing as if by art witchcraft that I had\nlicked Hunter, and was on good terms with the brewer, forthwith began to\ncome in crowds to look at me, pay me homage, and be my customers.\nMoreover, fifty scoundrels who owed me money, and would have seen me\nstarve rather than help me as long as they considered me a down pin,\nremembered their debts, and came and paid me more than they owed.  That\na'n't all; the brewer being about to establish a stage-coach and three,\nto run across the country, says it shall stop and change horses at my\nhouse, and the passengers breakfast and sup as it goes and returns.  He\nwishes me--whom he calls the best man in England--to give his son lessons\nin boxing, which he says he considers a fine manly English art, and a\ngreat defence against Popery--notwithstanding that only a month ago, when\nhe considered me a down pin, he was in the habit of railing against it as\na blackguard practice, and against me as a blackguard for following it;\nso I am going to commence with young hopeful to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I really cannot help congratulating you on your good fortune,\" said I.\n\n\"That a'n't all,\" said the landlord.  \"This very morning the folks of our\nparish made me churchwarden, which they would no more have done a month\nago, when they considered me a down pin, than they--\"\n\n\"Mercy upon us!\" said I, \"if fortune pours in upon you in this manner,\nwho knows but that within a year they may make you a justice of the\npeace?\"\n\n\"Who knows, indeed!\" said the landlord.  \"Well, I will prove myself\nworthy of my good luck by showing the grateful mind--not to those who\nwould be kind to me now, but to those who were, when the days were rather\ngloomy.  My customers shall have abundance of rough language, but I'll\nknock any one down who says anything against the clergyman who lent me\nthe fifty pounds, or against the Church of England, of which he is parson\nand I am churchwarden.  I am also ready to do anything in reason for him\nwho paid me for the ale he drank, when I shouldn't have had the heart to\ncollar him for the money had he refused to pay; who never jeered or\nflouted me like the rest of my customers when I was a down pin--and\nthough he refused to fight cross _for_ me was never cross _with_ me, but\nlistened to all I had to say, and gave me all kinds of good advice.  Now\nwho do you think I mean by this last? why, who but yourself--who on earth\nbut yourself?  The parson is a good man and a great preacher, and I'll\nknock anybody down who says to the contrary; and I mention him first,\nbecause why; he's a gentleman, and you a tinker.  But I am by no means\nsure you are not the best friend of the two; for I doubt, do you see,\nwhether I should have had the fifty pounds but for you.  You persuaded me\nto give up that silly drink they call sherry, and drink ale; and what was\nit but drinking ale which gave me courage to knock down that fellow\nHunter--and knocking him down was, I verily believe, the turning point of\nmy disorder.  God don't love them who won't strike out for themselves;\nand as far as I can calculate with respect to time, it was just the\nmoment after I had knocked down Hunter, that the parson consented to lend\nme the money, and everything began to grow civil to me.  So, dash my\nbuttons if I show the ungrateful mind to you!  I don't offer to knock\nanybody down for you, because why--I dare say you can knock a body down\nyourself; but I'll offer something more to the purpose; as my business is\nwonderfully on the increase, I shall want somebody to help me in serving\nmy customers, and keeping them in order.  If you choose to come and serve\nfor your board, and what they'll give you, give me your fist; or if you\nlike ten shillings a week better than their sixpences and ha'pence, only\nsay so--though, to be open with you, I believe you would make twice ten\nshillings out of them--the sneaking, fawning, curry-favouring humbugs!\"\n\n\"I am much obliged to you,\" said I, \"for your handsome offer, which,\nhowever, I am obliged to decline.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" said the landlord.\n\n\"I am not fit for service,\" said I; \"moreover, I am about to leave this\npart of the country.\"  As I spoke a horse neighed in the stable.  \"What\nhorse is that?\" said I.\n\n\"It belongs to a cousin of mine, who put it into my hands yesterday in\nthe hopes that I might get rid of it for him, though he would no more\nhave done so a week ago, when he considered me a down pin, than he would\nhave given the horse away.  Are you fond of horses?\"\n\n\"Very much,\" said I.\n\n\"Then come and look at it.\"  He led me into the stable, where, in a\nstall, stood a noble-looking animal.\n\n\"Dear me,\" said I, \"I saw this horse at --- fair.\"\n\n\"Like enough,\" said the landlord; \"he was there and was offered for\nseventy pounds, but didn't find a bidder at any price.  What do you think\nof him?\"\n\n\"He's a splendid creature.\"\n\n\"I am no judge of horses,\" said the landlord; \"but I am told he's a first-\nrate trotter, good leaper, and has some of the blood of Syntax.  What\ndoes all that signify?--the game is against his master, who is a down\npin, is thinking of emigrating, and wants money confoundedly.  He asked\nseventy pounds at the fair; but, between ourselves, he would be glad to\ntake fifty here.\"\n\n\"I almost wish,\" said I, \"that I were a rich squire.\"\n\n\"You would buy him then,\" said the landlord.  Here he mused for some\ntime, with a very profound look.  \"It would be a rum thing,\" said he,\n\"if, some time or other, that horse should come into your hands.  Didn't\nyou hear how he neighed when you talked about leaving the country?  My\ngranny was a wise woman, and was up to all kinds of signs and wonders,\nsounds and noises, the interpretation of the language of birds and\nanimals, crowing and lowing, neighing and braying.  If she had been here,\nshe would have said at once that that horse was fated to carry you away.\nOn that point, however, I can say nothing, for under fifty pounds no one\ncan have him.  Are you taking that money out of your pocket to pay me for\nthe ale?  That won't do; nothing to pay; I invited you this time.  Now if\nyou are going, you had best get into the road through the yard-gate.  I\nwon't trouble you to make your way through the kitchen and my\nfine-weather company--confound them!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nMr. Petulengro's Device--The Leathern Purse--Consent to Purchase a Horse.\n\nAs I returned along the road I met Mr. Petulengro and one of his\ncompanions, who told me that they were bound for the public-house;\nwhereupon I informed Jasper how I had seen in the stable the horse which\nwe had admired at the fair.  \"I shouldn't wonder if you buy that horse\nafter all, brother,\" said Mr. Petulengro.  With a smile at the absurdity\nof such a supposition, I left him and his companion, and betook myself to\nthe dingle.  In the evening I received a visit from Mr. Petulengro, who\nforthwith commenced talking about the horse, which he had again seen, the\nlandlord having shown it to him on learning that he was a friend of mine.\nHe told me that the horse pleased him more than ever, he having examined\nhis points with more accuracy than he had an opportunity of doing on the\nfirst occasion, concluding by pressing me to buy him.  I begged him to\ndesist from such foolish importunity, assuring him that I had never so\nmuch money in all my life as would enable me to purchase the horse.\nWhilst this discourse was going on, Mr. Petulengro and myself were\nstanding together in the midst of the dingle.  Suddenly he began to move\nround me--in a very singular manner, making strange motions with his\nhands, and frightful contortions with his features, till I became\nalarmed, and asked him whether he had not lost his senses?  Whereupon,\nceasing his movements and contortions, he assured me that he had not, but\nhad merely been seized with a slight dizziness, and then once more\nreturned to the subject of the horse.  Feeling myself very angry, I told\nhim that if he continued persecuting me in that manner, I should be\nobliged to quarrel with him; adding, that I believed his only motive for\nasking me to buy the animal was to insult my poverty.  \"Pretty poverty,\"\nsaid he, \"with fifty pounds in your pocket; however, I have heard say\nthat it is always the custom of your rich people to talk of their\npoverty, more especially when they wish to avoid laying out money.\"\nSurprised at his saying that I had fifty pounds in my pocket, I asked him\nwhat he meant; whereupon he told me that he was very sure that I had\nfifty pounds in my pocket, offering to lay me five shillings to that\neffect.  \"Done!\" said I; \"I have scarcely more than the fifth part of\nwhat you say.\"  \"I know better, brother,\" said Mr. Petulengro; \"if you\nonly pull out what you have in the pocket of your slop, I am sure you\nwill have lost your wager.\"  Putting my hand into the pocket, I felt\nsomething which I had never felt there before, and pulling it out,\nperceived that it was a clumsy leathern purse, which I found on opening\ncontained four ten-pound-notes, and several pieces of gold.  \"Didn't I\ntell you so, brother?\" said Mr. Petulengro.  \"Now, in the first place,\nplease to pay me the five shillings you have lost.\"  \"This is only a\nfoolish piece of pleasantry,\" said I; \"you put it into my pocket whilst\nyou were moving about me, making faces like a distracted person.  Here,\ntake your purse back.\"  \"I?\" said Mr. Petulengro, \"not I, indeed I don't\nthink I am such a fool.  I have won my wager, so pay me the five\nshillings, brother.\"  \"Do drop this folly,\" said I, \"and take your\npurse;\" and I flung it on the ground.  \"Brother,\" said Mr. Petulengro,\n\"you were talking of quarrelling with me just now.  I tell you now one\nthing, which is, that if you do not take back the purse I will quarrel\nwith you; and it shall be for good and all.  I'll drop your acquaintance,\nno longer call you my pal, and not even say sarshan to you when I meet\nyou by the roadside.  Hir mi diblis I never will.\"  I saw by Jasper's\nlook and tone that he was in earnest, and, as I had really a regard for\nthe strange being, I scarcely knew what to do.  \"Now, be persuaded,\nbrother,\" said Mr. Petulengro, taking up the purse, and handing it to me;\n\"be persuaded; put the purse into your pocket, and buy the horse.\"\n\"Well,\" said I, \"if I did so, would you acknowledge the horse to be\nyours, and receive the money again as soon as I should be able to repay\nyou?\"\n\n\"I would, brother, I would,\" said he; \"return me the money as soon as you\nplease, provided you buy the horse.\"  \"What motive have you for wishing\nme to buy that horse?\" said I.  \"He's to be sold for fifty pounds,\" said\nJasper, \"and is worth four times that sum; though, like many a splendid\nbargain, he is now going a begging; buy him, and I'm confident that, in a\nlittle time, a grand gentleman of your appearance may have anything he\nasks for him, and found a fortune by his means.  Moreover, brother, I\nwant to dispose of this fifty pounds in a safe manner.  If you don't take\nit, I shall fool it away in no time, perhaps at card-playing, for you saw\nhow I was cheated by those blackguard jockeys the other day--we gyptians\ndon't know how to take care of money: our best plan when we have got a\nhandful of guineas is to make buttons with them; but I have plenty of\ngolden buttons, and don't wish to be troubled with more, so you can do me\nno greater favour than vesting the money in this speculation, by which my\nmind will be relieved of considerable care and trouble for some time at\nleast.\"\n\nPerceiving that I still hesitated, he said, \"Perhaps, brother, you think\nI did not come honestly by the money: by the honestest manner in the\nworld, for it is the money I earnt by fighting in the ring: I did not\nsteal it, brother, nor did I get it by disposing of spavined donkeys, or\nglandered ponies--nor is it, brother, the profits of my wife's witchcraft\nand dukkerin.\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"you had better employ it in your traffic.\"  \"I have\nplenty of money for my traffic, independent of this capital,\" said Mr.\nPetulengro; \"ay, brother, and enough besides to back the husband of my\nwife's sister, Sylvester, against Slammocks of the Chong gav for twenty\npounds, which I am thinking of doing.\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"after all, the horse may have found another purchaser by\nthis time.\"  \"Not he,\" said Mr. Petulengro, \"there is nobody in this\nneighbourhood to purchase a horse like that, unless it be your\nlordship--so take the money, brother,\" and he thrust the purse into my\nhand.  Allowing myself to be persuaded, I kept possession of the purse.\n\"Are you satisfied now?\" said I.  \"By no means, brother,\" said Mr.\nPetulengro, \"you will please to pay me the five shillings which you lost\nto me.\"  \"Why,\" said I, \"the fifty pounds which I found in my pocket were\nnot mine, but put in by yourself.\"  \"That's nothing to do with the\nmatter, brother,\" said Mr. Petulengro, \"I betted you five shillings that\nyou had fifty pounds in your pocket, which sum you had: I did not say\nthat they were your own, but merely that you had fifty pounds; you will\ntherefore pay me, brother, or I shall not consider you an honourable\nman.\"  Not wishing to have any dispute about such a matter, I took five\nshillings out of my under pocket, and gave them to him.  Mr. Petulengro\ntook the money with great glee, observing--\"These five shillings I will\ntake to the public-house forthwith, and spend in drinking with four of my\nbrethren, and doing so will give me an opportunity of telling the\nlandlord that I have found a customer for his horse, and that you are the\nman.  It will be as well to secure the horse as soon as possible; for\nthough the dook tells me that the horse is intended for you, I have now\nand then found that the dook is, like myself, somewhat given to lying.\"\n\nHe then departed, and I remained alone in the dingle.  I thought at first\nthat I had committed a great piece of folly in consenting to purchase\nthis horse; I might find no desirable purchaser for him, until the money\nin my possession should be totally exhausted, and then I might be\ncompelled to sell him for half the price I had given for him, or be even\nglad to find a person who would receive him at a gift; I should then\nremain sans horse, and indebted to Mr. Petulengro.  Nevertheless, it was\npossible that I might sell the horse very advantageously, and by so doing\nobtain a fund sufficient to enable me to execute some grand enterprise or\nother.  My present way of life afforded no prospect of support, whereas\nthe purchase of the horse did afford a possibility of bettering my\ncondition, so, after all, had I not done right in consenting to purchase\nthe horse? the purchase was to be made with another person's property, it\nis true, and I did not exactly like the idea of speculating with another\nperson's property, but Mr. Petulengro had thrust his money upon me, and\nif I lost his money, he could have no one but himself to blame; so I\npersuaded myself that I had, upon the whole, done right, and having come\nto that persuasion, I soon began to enjoy the idea of finding myself on\nhorseback again, and figured to myself all kinds of strange adventures\nwhich I should meet with on the roads before the horse and I should part\ncompany.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nTrying the Horse--The Feats of Tawno--Man with the Red\nWaist-coat--Disposal of Property.\n\nI saw nothing more of Mr. Petulengro that evening--on the morrow,\nhowever, he came and informed me that he had secured the horse for me,\nand that I was to go and pay for it at noon.  At the hour appointed,\ntherefore, I went with Mr. Petulengro and Tawno to the public, where, as\nbefore, there was a crowd of company.  The landlord received us in the\nbar with marks of much satisfaction and esteem, made us sit down, and\ntreated us with some excellent mild draught ale.  \"Who do you think has\nbeen here this morning?\" he said to me, \"why, that fellow in black, who\ncame to carry me off to a house of Popish devotion, where I was to pass\nseven days and nights in meditation, as I think he called it, before I\npublicly renounced the religion of my country.  I read him a pretty\nlecture, calling him several unhandsome names, and asking him what he\nmeant by attempting to seduce a church-warden of the Church of England.  I\ntell you what, he ran some danger; for some of my customers, learning his\nerrand, laid hold on him, and were about to toss him in a blanket, and\nthen duck him in the horse-pond.  I, however, interfered, and said, 'that\nwhat he came about was between me and him, and that it was no business of\ntheirs.'  To tell you the truth, I felt pity for the poor devil, more\nespecially when I considered that they merely sided against him because\nthey thought him the weakest, and that they would have wanted to serve me\nin the same manner had they considered me a down pin; so I rescued him\nfrom their hands, told him not to be afraid, for that nobody should touch\nhim, and offered to treat him to some cold gin and water with a lump of\nsugar in it; and on his refusing, told him that he had better make\nhimself scarce, which he did, and I hope I shall never see him again.  So\nI suppose you are come for the horse; mercy upon us! who would have\nthought you would have become the purchaser?  The horse, however, seemed\nto know it by his neighing.  How did you ever come by the money? however,\nthat's no matter of mine.  I suppose you are strongly backed by certain\nfriends you have.\"\n\nI informed the landlord that he was right in supposing that I came for\nthe horse, but that, before I paid for him, I should wish to prove his\ncapabilities.  \"With all my heart,\" said the landlord.  \"You shall mount\nhim this moment.\"  Then going into the stable, he saddled and bridled the\nhorse, and presently brought him out before the door.  I mounted him, Mr.\nPetulengro putting a heavy whip into my hand, and saying a few words to\nme in his own mysterious language.  \"The horse wants no whip,\" said the\nlandlord.  \"Hold your tongue, daddy,\" said Mr. Petulengro.  \"My pal knows\nquite well what to do with the whip, he's not going to beat the horse\nwith it.\"  About four hundred yards from the house there was a hill, to\nthe foot of which the road ran almost on a perfect level; towards the\nfoot of this hill I trotted the horse, who set off at a long, swift pace,\nseemingly at the rate of about sixteen miles an hour.  On reaching the\nfoot of the hill, I wheeled the animal round, and trotted him towards the\nhouse--the horse sped faster than before.  Ere he had advanced a hundred\nyards, I took off my hat, in obedience to the advice which Mr. Petulengro\nhad given me, in his own language, and holding it over the horse's head\ncommenced drumming on the crown with the knob of the whip; the horse gave\na slight start, but instantly recovering himself, continued his trot till\nhe arrived at the door of the public-house, amidst the acclamations of\nthe company, who had all rushed out of the house to be spectators of what\nwas going on. \"I see now what you wanted the whip for,\" said the\nlandlord, \"and sure enough, that drumming on your hat was no bad way of\nlearning whether the horse was quiet or not.  Well, did you ever see a\nmore quiet horse, or a better trotter?\"  \"My cob shall trot against him,\"\nsaid a fellow, dressed in velveteen, mounted on a low powerful-looking\nanimal.  \"My cob shall trot against him to the hill and back again--come\non!\"  We both started; the cob kept up gallantly against the horse for\nabout half way to the hill, when he began to lose ground; at the foot of\nthe hill he was about fifteen yards behind.  Whereupon I turned slowly\nand waited for him.  We then set off towards the house, but now the cob\nhad no chance, being at least twenty yards behind when I reached the\ndoor.  This running of the horse, the wild uncouth forms around me, and\nthe ale and beer which were being guzzled from pots and flagons, put me\nwonderfully in mind of the ancient horse-races of the heathen north.  I\nalmost imagined myself Gunnar of Hlitharend at the race of--\n\n\"Are you satisfied?\" said the landlord.  \"Didn't you tell me that he\ncould leap?\" I demanded.  \"I am told he can,\" said the landlord; \"but I\ncan't consent that he should be tried in that way, as he might be\ndamaged.\"  \"That's right!\" said Mr. Petulengro, \"don't trust my pal to\nleap that horse, he'll merely fling him down, and break his neck and his\nown.  There's a better man than he close by; let him get on his back and\nleap him.\"  \"You mean yourself, I suppose,\" said the landlord.  \"Well, I\ncall that talking modestly, and nothing becomes a young man more than\nmodesty.\"  \"It a'n't I, daddy,\" said Mr. Petulengro.  \"Here's the man,\"\nsaid he, pointing to Tawno.  \"Here's the horse-leaper of the world!\"  \"You\nmean the horse-back breaker,\" said the landlord.  \"That big fellow would\nbreak down my cousin's horse.\"  \"Why, he weighs only sixteen stone,\" said\nMr. Petulengro.  \"And his sixteen stone, with his way of handling a\nhorse, does not press so much as any other one's thirteen.  Only let him\nget on the horse's back, and you'll see what he can do!\"  \"No,\" said the\nlandlord, \"it won't do.\" Whereupon Mr. Petulengro became very much\nexcited; and pulling out a handful of money, said, \"I'll tell you what,\nI'll forfeit these guineas, if my black pal there does the horse any kind\nof damage; duck me in the horse-pond if I don't.\"  \"Well,\" said the\nlandlord, \"for the sport of the thing I consent, so let your white pal\nget down, and our black pal mount as soon as he pleases.\"  I felt rather\nmortified at Mr. Petulengro's interference; and showed no disposition to\nquit my seat; whereupon he came up to me and said, \"Now, brother, do get\nout of the saddle--you are no bad hand at trotting, I am willing to\nacknowledge that; but at leaping a horse there is no one like Tawno.  Let\nevery dog be praised for his own gift.  You have been showing off in your\nline for the last half-hour; now do give Tawno a chance of exhibiting a\nlittle; poor fellow, he hasn't often a chance of exhibiting, as his wife\nkeeps him so much out of sight.\"  Not wishing to appear desirous of\nengrossing the public attention, and feeling rather desirous to see how\nTawno, of whose exploits in leaping horses I had frequently heard, would\nacquit himself in the affair, I at length dismounted, and Tawno, at a\nbound, leaped into the saddle, where he really looked like Gunnar of\nHlitharend, save and except the complexion of Gunnar was florid, whereas\nthat of Tawno was of nearly Mulatto darkness; and that all Tawno's\nfeatures were cast in the Grecian model, whereas Gunnar had a snub nose.\n\"There's a leaping-bar behind the house,\" said the landlord.  \"Leaping-\nbar!\" said Mr. Petulengro, scornfully.  \"Do you think my black pal ever\nrides at a leaping-bar?  No more than a windle-straw.  Leap over that\nmeadow-wall, Tawno.\"  Just past the house, in the direction in which I\nhad been trotting, was a wall about four feet high, beyond which was a\nsmall meadow.  Tawno rode the horse gently up to the wall, permitted him\nto look over, then backed him for about ten yards, and pressing his\ncalves against the horse's sides, he loosed the rein, and the horse\nlaunching forward, took the leap in gallant style.  \"Well done, man and\nhorse!\" said Mr. Petulengro, \"now come back, Tawno.\"  The leap from the\nside of the meadow was, however, somewhat higher; and the horse, when\npushed at it, at first turned away; whereupon Tawno backed him to a\ngreater distance, pushed the horse to a full gallop, giving a wild cry;\nwhereupon the horse again took the wall, slightly grazing one of his legs\nagainst it.  \"A near thing,\" said the landlord; \"but a good leap.  Now,\nno more leaping, so long as I have control over the animal.\"  The horse\nwas then led back to the stable; and the landlord, myself and companions\ngoing into the bar, I paid down the money for the horse.\n\nScarcely was the bargain concluded, when two or three of the company\nbegan to envy me the possession of the horse, and forcing their way into\nthe bar, with much noise and clamour, said that the horse had been sold\ntoo cheap.  One fellow, in particular, with a red waistcoat, the son of a\nwealthy farmer, said that if he had but known that the horse had been so\ngood a one, he would have bought it at the first price asked for it,\nwhich he was now willing to pay, that is to-morrow, supposing--\"supposing\nyour father will let you have the money,\" said the landlord, \"which,\nafter all, might not be the case; but, however that may be, it is too\nlate now.  I think myself the horse has been sold for too little money,\nbut if so all the better for the young man, who came forward when no\nother body did with his money in his hand.  There, take yourselves out of\nmy bar,\" he said to the fellows; \"and a pretty scoundrel you,\" said he to\nthe man of the red waistcoat, \"to say the horse has been sold too cheap;\nwhy, it was only yesterday you said he was good for nothing, and were\npassing all kinds of jokes at him.  Take yourself out of my bar, I say,\nyou and all of you,\" and he turned the fellows out.  I then asked the\nlandlord whether he would permit the horse to remain in the stable for a\nshort time, provided I paid for his entertainment; and on his willingly\nconsenting, I treated my friends with ale, and then returned with them to\nthe encampment.\n\nThat evening I informed Mr. Petulengro and his party that on the morrow I\nintended to mount my horse, and leave that part of the country in quest\nof adventures; inquiring of Jasper where, in the event of my selling the\nhorse advantageously, I might meet with him, and repay the money I had\nborrowed of him; whereupon Mr. Petulengro informed me that in about ten\nweeks I might find him at a certain place at the Chong gav.  I then\nstated that as I could not well carry with me the property which I\npossessed in the dingle, which after all was of no considerable value, I\nhad resolved to bestow the said property, namely, the pony, tent, tinker-\ntools, etc., on Ursula and her husband, partly because they were poor,\nand partly on account of the great kindness which I bore to Ursula, from\nwhom I had, on various occasions, experienced all manner of civility,\nparticularly in regard to crabbed words.  On hearing this intelligence,\nUrsula returned many thanks to her gentle brother, as she called me, and\nSylvester was so overjoyed that, casting aside his usual phlegm, he said\nI was the best friend he had ever had in the world, and in testimony of\nhis gratitude swore that he would permit his wife to give me a choomer in\nthe presence of the whole company, which offer, however, met with a very\nmortifying reception, the company frowning disapprobation, Ursula\nprotesting against anything of the kind, and I myself showing no\nforwardness to avail myself of it, having inherited from nature a\nconsiderable fund of modesty, to which was added no slight store acquired\nin the course of my Irish education.  I passed that night alone in the\ndingle in a very melancholy manner, with little or no sleep, thinking of\nIsopel Berners; and in the morning when I quitted it I shed several\ntears, as I reflected that I should probably never again see the spot\nwhere I had passed so many hours in her company.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nFarewell to the Romans--The Landlord and His Niece--Set Out as a\nTraveller.\n\nOn reaching the plain above, I found my Romany friends breakfasting, and\non being asked by Mr. Petulengro to join them, I accepted the invitation.\nNo sooner was breakfast over than I informed Ursula and her husband that\nthey would find the property, which I had promised them, in the dingle,\ncommending the little pony Ambrol to their best care.  I took leave of\nthe whole company, which was itself about to break up camp and to depart\nin the direction of London, and made the best of my way to the public-\nhouse.  I had a small bundle in my hand, and was dressed in the same\nmanner as when I departed from London, having left my waggoner's slop\nwith the other effects in the dingle.  On arriving at the public-house, I\ninformed the landlord that I was come for my horse, inquiring, at the\nsame time, whether he could not accommodate me with a bridle and saddle.\nHe told me that the bridle and saddle, with which I had ridden the horse\non the preceding day, were at my service for a trifle; that he had\nreceived them some time since in payment for a debt, and that he had\nhimself no use for them.  The leathers of the bridle were rather shabby,\nand the bit rusty, and the saddle was old fashioned; but I was happy to\npurchase them for seven shillings, more especially as the landlord added\na small valise, which he said could be strapped to the saddle, and which\nI should find very convenient for carrying my things in.  I then\nproceeded to the stable, told the horse we were bound on an expedition,\nand giving him a feed of corn, left him to discuss it, and returned to\nthe bar-room to have a little farewell chat with the landlord, and at the\nsame time to drink with him a farewell glass of ale.  Whilst we were\ntalking and drinking, the niece came and joined us: she was a decent,\nsensible young woman, who appeared to take a great interest in her uncle,\nwhom she regarded with a singular mixture of pride and,\ndisapprobation--pride for the renown which he had acquired by his feats\nof old, and disapprobation for his late imprudences.  She said that she\nhoped that his misfortunes would be a warning to him to turn more to his\nGod than he had hitherto done, and to give up cock-fighting and other low-\nlife practices.  To which the landlord replied, that with respect to cock-\nfighting he intended to give it up entirely, being determined no longer\nto risk his capital upon birds, and with respect to his religious duties,\nhe should attend the church of which he was churchwarden at least once a\nquarter, adding, however, that he did not intend to become either canter\nor driveller, neither of which characters would befit a publican\nsurrounded by such customers as he was, and that to the last day of his\nlife he hoped to be able to make use of his fists.  After a stay of about\ntwo hours I settled accounts, and having bridled and saddled my horse,\nand strapped on my valise, I mounted, shook hands with the landlord and\nhis niece, and departed, notwithstanding that they both entreated me to\ntarry until the evening, it being then the heat of the day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nAn Adventure on the Road--The Six Flint Stone--A Rural Scene--Mead--The\nOld Man and His Bees.\n\nI bent my course in the direction of the north, more induced by chance\nthan any particular motive; all quarters of the world having about equal\nattractions for me.  I was in high spirits at finding myself once more on\nhorse-back, and trotted gaily on, until the heat of the weather induced\nme to slacken my pace, more out of pity for my horse than because I felt\nany particular inconvenience from it--heat and cold being then, and\nstill, matters of great indifference to me.  What I thought of I scarcely\nknow, save and except that I have a glimmering recollection that I felt\nsome desire to meet with one of those adventures which upon the roads of\nEngland are generally as plentiful as blackberries in autumn; and\nFortune, who has generally been ready to gratify my inclinations,\nprovided it cost her very little by so doing, was not slow in furnishing\nme with an adventure, perhaps as characteristic of the English roads as\nanything which could have happened.\n\nI might have travelled about six miles amongst cross roads and lanes,\nwhen suddenly I found myself upon a broad and very dusty road which\nseemed to lead due north.  As I wended along this I saw a man upon a\ndonkey riding towards me.  The man was commonly dressed, with a broad\nfelt hat on his head, and a kind of satchel on his back; he seemed to be\nin a mighty hurry, and was every now and then belabouring the donkey with\na cudgel.  The donkey, however, which was a fine large creature of the\nsilver-grey species, did not appear to sympathize at all with its rider\nin his desire to get on, but kept its head turned back as much as\npossible, moving from one side of the road to the other, and not making\nmuch forward way.  As I passed, being naturally of a very polite\ndisposition, I gave the man the sele of the day, asking him, at the same\ntime, why he beat the donkey; whereupon the fellow eyeing me askance,\ntold me to mind my own business, with the addition of something which I\nneed not repeat.  I had not proceeded a furlong before I saw seated on\nthe dust by the wayside, close by a heap of stones, and with several\nflints before him, a respectable-looking old man, with a straw hat and a\nwhite smock, who was weeping bitterly.\n\n\"What are you crying for, father?\" said I.  \"Have you come to any hurt?\"\n\"Hurt enough,\" sobbed the old man, \"I have just been tricked out of the\nbest ass in England by a villain, who gave me nothing but these trash in\nreturn,\" pointing to the stones before him.  \"I really scarcely\nunderstand you,\" said I, \"I wish you would explain yourself more\nclearly.\"  \"I was riding on my ass from market,\" said the old man, \"when\nI met here a fellow with a sack on his back, who, after staring at the\nass and me a moment or two, asked me if I would sell her.  I told him\nthat I could not think of selling her, as she was very useful to me, and\nthough an animal, my true companion, whom I loved as much as if she were\nmy wife and daughter.  I then attempted to pass on, but the fellow stood\nbefore me, begging me to sell her, saying that he would give me anything\nfor her; well, seeing that he persisted, I said at last that if I sold\nher, I must have six pounds for her, and I said so to get rid of him, for\nI saw that he was a shabby fellow, who had probably not six shillings in\nthe world; but I had better have held my tongue,\" said the old man,\ncrying more bitterly than before, \"for the words were scarcely out of my\nmouth, when he said he would give me what I asked, and taking the sack\nfrom his back, he pulled out a steelyard, and going to the heap of stones\nthere, he took up several of them and weighed them, then flinging them\ndown before me, he said, 'There are six pounds, neighbour; now, get off\nthe ass, and hand her over to me.'  Well, I sat like one dumbfoundered\nfor a time, till at last I asked him what he meant?  'What do I mean?'\nsaid he, 'you old rascal, why, I mean to claim my purchase,' and then he\nswore so awfully, that scarcely knowing what I did I got down, and he\njumped on the animal and rode off as fast as he could.\"  \"I suppose he\nwas the fellow,\" said I, \"whom I just now met upon a fine gray ass, which\nhe was beating with a cudgel.\"  \"I dare say he was,\" said the old man, \"I\nsaw him beating her as he rode away, and I thought I should have died.\"\n\"I never heard such a story,\" said I; \"well, do you mean to submit to\nsuch a piece of roguery quietly?\"  \"Oh, dear,\" said the old man, \"what\ncan I do?  I am seventy-nine years of age; I am bad on my feet, and\ndar'n't go after him.\"--\"Shall I go?\" said I; \"the fellow is a thief, and\nany one has a right to stop him.\"  \"Oh, if you could but bring her again\nto me,\" said the old man, \"I would bless you till my dying day; but have\na care; I don't know but after all the law may say that she is his lawful\npurchase.  I asked six pounds for her, and he gave me six pounds.\"  \"Six\nflints, you mean,\" said I, \"no, no, the law is not quite so bad as that\neither; I know something about her, and am sure that she will never\nsanction such a quibble.  At all events, I'll ride after the fellow.\"\nThereupon turning my horse round, I put him to his very best trot; I rode\nnearly a mile without obtaining a glimpse of the fellow, and was becoming\napprehensive that he had escaped me by turning down some by-path, two or\nthree of which I had passed.  Suddenly, however, on the road making a\nslight turning, I perceived him right before me, moving at a tolerably\nswift pace, having by this time probably overcome the resistance of the\nanimal.  Putting my horse to a full gallop, I shouted at the top of my\nvoice, \"Get off that donkey, you rascal, and give her up to me, or I'll\nride you down.\"  The fellow hearing the thunder of the horse's hoofs\nbehind him, drew up on one side of the road.  \"What do you want?\" said\nhe, as I stopped my charger, now almost covered with sweat and foam close\nbeside him.  \"Do you want to rob me?\"  \"To rob you?\" said I.  \"No! but to\ntake from you that ass, of which you have just robbed its owner.\"  \"I\nhave robbed no man,\" said the fellow; \"I just now purchased it fairly of\nits master, and the law will give it to me; he asked six pounds for it,\nand I gave him six pounds.\"  \"Six stones, you mean, you rascal,\" said I;\n\"get down, or my horse shall be upon you in a moment;\" then with a motion\nof my reins, I caused the horse to rear, pressing his sides with my heels\nas if I intended to make him leap.  \"Stop,\" said the man, \"I'll get down,\nand then try if I can't serve you out.\"  He then got down, and confronted\nme with his cudgel; he was a horrible-looking fellow, and seemed prepared\nfor anything.  Scarcely, however, had he dismounted, when the donkey\njerked the bridle out of his hand, and probably in revenge for the usage\nshe had received, gave him a pair of tremendous kicks on the hip with her\nhinder legs, which overturned him, and then scampered down the road the\nway she had come.  \"Pretty treatment this,\" said the fellow, getting up\nwithout his cudgel, and holding his hand to his side, \"I wish I may not\nbe lamed for life.\"  \"And if you be,\" said I, \"it will merely serve you\nright, you rascal, for trying to cheat a poor old man out of his property\nby quibbling at words.\"  \"Rascal!\" said the fellow, \"you lie, I am no\nrascal; and as for quibbling with words--suppose I did!  What then?  All\nthe first people does it!  The newspapers does it! the gentlefolks that\ncalls themselves the guides of the popular mind does it!  I'm no\nignoramus.  I read the newspapers, and knows what's what.\"  \"You read\nthem to some purpose,\" said I.  \"Well, if you are lamed for life, and\nunfitted for any active line--turn newspaper editor; I should say you are\nperfectly qualified, and this day's adventure may be the foundation of\nyour fortune,\" thereupon I turned round and rode off.  The fellow\nfollowed me with a torrent of abuse.  \"Confound you,\" said he--yet that\nwas not the expression either--\"I know you; you are one of the\nhorse-patrol come down into the country on leave to see your relations.\nConfound you, you and the like of you have knocked my business on the\nhead near Lunnon, and I suppose we shall have you shortly in the\ncountry.\"  \"To the newspaper office,\" said I, \"and fabricate falsehoods\nout of flint stones;\" then touching the horse with my heels, I trotted\noff, and coming to the place where I had seen the old man, I found him\nthere, risen from the ground, and embracing his ass.\n\nI told him that I was travelling down the road, and said, that if his way\nlay in the same direction as mine he could do no better than accompany me\nfor some distance, lest the fellow who, for aught I knew, might be\nhovering nigh, might catch him alone, and again get his ass from him.\nAfter thanking me for my offer, which he said he would accept, he got\nupon his ass, and we proceeded together down the road.  My new\nacquaintance said very little of his own accord; and when I asked him a\nquestion, answered rather incoherently.  I heard him every now and then\nsay, \"Villain!\" to himself, after which he would pat the donkey's neck,\nfrom which circumstance I concluded that his mind was occupied with his\nlate adventure.  After travelling about two miles, we reached a place\nwhere a drift-way on the right led from the great road; here my companion\nstopped, and on my asking him whether he was going any farther, he told\nme that the path to the right was the way to his home.\n\nI was bidding him farewell, when he hemmed once or twice, and said, that\nas he did not live far off, he hoped that I would go with him and taste\nsome of his mead.  As I had never tasted mead, of which I had frequently\nread in the compositions of the Welsh bards, and, moreover, felt rather\nthirsty from the heat of the day, I told him that I should have great\npleasure in attending him.  Whereupon, turning off together, we proceeded\nabout half a mile, sometimes between stone walls, and at other times\nhedges, till we reached a small hamlet, through which we passed, and\npresently came to a very pretty cottage, delightfully situated within a\ngarden, surrounded by a hedge of woodbines.  Opening a gate at one corner\nof the garden he led the way to a large shed, which stood partly behind\nthe cottage, which he said was his stable; thereupon he dismounted and\nled his donkey into the shed, which was without stalls, but had a long\nrack and manger.  On one side he tied his donkey, after taking off her\ncaparisons, and I followed his example, tying my horse at the other side\nwith a rope halter which he gave me; he then asked me to come in and\ntaste his mead, but I told him that I must attend to the comfort of my\nhorse first, and forthwith, taking a wisp of straw, rubbed him carefully\ndown.  Then taking a pailful of clear water which stood in the shed, I\nallowed the horse to drink about half a pint; and then turning to the old\nman, who all the time had stood by looking at my proceedings, I asked him\nwhether he had any oats?  \"I have all kinds of grain,\" he replied; and,\ngoing out, he presently returned with two measures, one a large and the\nother a small one, both filled with oats, mixed with a few beans, and\nhanding the large one to me for the horse, he emptied the other before\nthe donkey, who, before she began to despatch it, turned her nose to her\nmaster's face, and fairly kissed him.  Having given my horse his portion,\nI told the old man that I was ready to taste his mead as soon as he\npleased, whereupon he ushered me into his cottage, where, making me sit\ndown by a deal table in a neatly sanded kitchen, he produced from an old-\nfashioned closet a bottle, holding about a quart, and a couple of cups,\nwhich might each contain about half a pint, then opening the bottle and\nfilling the cups with a brown-coloured liquor, he handed one to me, and\ntaking a seat opposite to me, he lifted the other, nodded, and saying to\nme--\"Health and welcome,\" placed it to his lips and drank.\n\n\"Health and thanks,\" I replied; and being very thirsty, emptied my cup at\na draught; I had scarcely done so, however, when I half repented.  The\nmead was deliciously sweet and mellow, but appeared strong as brandy; my\neyes reeled in my head, and my brain became slightly dizzy.  \"Mead is a\nstrong drink,\" said the old man, as he looked at me, with a half smile on\nhis countenance.  \"This is at any rate,\" said I, \"so strong, indeed, that\nI would not drink another cup for any consideration.\"  \"And I would not\nask you,\" said the old man; \"for, if you did, you would most probably be\nstupid all day, and wake the next morning with a headache.  Mead is a\ngood drink, but woundily strong, especially to those who be not used to\nit, as I suppose you are not.\"  \"Where do you get it?\" said I.  \"I make\nit myself,\" said the old man, \"from the honey which my bees make.\"  \"Have\nyou many bees?\" I inquired.  \"A great many,\" said the old man.  \"And do\nyou keep them,\" said I, \"for the sake of making mead with their honey?\"\n\"I keep them,\" he replied, \"partly because I am fond of them, and partly\nfor what they bring me in; they make me a great deal of honey, some of\nwhich I sell, and with a little I make some mead to warm my poor heart\nwith, or occasionally to treat a friend with like yourself.\"  \"And do you\nsupport yourself entirely by means of your bees?\"  \"No,\" said the old\nman; \"I have a little bit of ground behind my house, which is my\nprincipal means of support.\"  \"And do you live alone?\"  \"Yes,\" said he;\n\"with the exception of the bees and the donkey, I live quite alone.\"  \"And\nhave you always lived alone?\"  The old man emptied his cup, and his heart\nbeing warmed with the mead, he told his history, which was simplicity\nitself.  His father was a small yeoman, who, at his death, had left him,\nhis only child, the cottage, with a small piece of ground behind it, and\non this little property he had lived ever since.  About the age of twenty-\nfive he had married an industrious young woman, by whom he had one\ndaughter, who died before reaching years of womanhood.  His wife,\nhowever, had survived her daughter many years, and had been a great\ncomfort to him, assisting him in his rural occupations; but, about four\nyears before the present period, he had lost her, since which time he had\nlived alone, making himself as comfortable as he could; cultivating his\nground, with the help of a lad from the neighbouring village, attending\nto his bees, and occasionally riding his donkey to market, and hearing\nthe word of God, which he said he was sorry he could not read, twice a\nweek regularly at the parish church.  Such was the old man's tale.\n\nWhen he had finished speaking, he led me behind his house, and showed me\nhis little domain.  It consisted of about two acres in admirable\ncultivation; a small portion of it formed a kitchen garden, while the\nrest was sown with four kinds of grain, wheat, barley, peas, and beans.\nThe air was full of ambrosial sweets, resembling those proceeding from an\norange grove; a place which though I had never seen at that time, I since\nhave.  In the garden was the habitation of the bees, a long box,\nsupported upon three oaken stumps.  It was full of small round glass\nwindows, and appeared to be divided into a great many compartments, much\nresembling drawers placed sideways.  He told me that, as one compartment\nwas filled, the bees left it for another; so that, whenever he wanted\nhoney, he could procure some without injury to the insects.  Through the\nlittle round windows I could see several of the bees at work; hundreds\nwere going in and out of the doors; hundreds were buzzing about on the\nflowers, the woodbines, and beans.  As I looked around on the\nwell-cultivated field, the garden, and the bees, I thought I had never\nbefore seen so rural and peaceful a scene.\n\nWhen we returned to the cottage we again sat down, and I asked the old\nman whether he was not afraid to live alone.  He told me that he was not,\nfor that, upon the whole, his neighbours were very kind to him.  I\nmentioned the fellow who had swindled him of his donkey upon the road.\n\"That was no neighbour of mine,\" said the old man, \"and, perhaps, I shall\nnever see him again, or his like.\"  \"It's a dreadful thing,\" said I, \"to\nhave no other resource, when injured, than to shed tears on the road.\"\n\"It is so,\" said the old man; \"but God saw the tears of the old, and sent\na helper.\"  \"Why did you not help yourself?\" said I.  \"Instead of getting\noff your ass, why did you not punch at the fellow, or at any rate use\ndreadful language, call him villain, and shout robbery?\"  \"Punch!\" said\nthe old man, \"shout! what, with these hands, and this voice--Lord, how\nyou run on!  I am old, young chap, I am old!\"  \"Well,\" said I, \"it is a\nshameful thing to cry even when old.\"  \"You think so now,\" said the old\nman, \"because you are young and strong; perhaps when you are as old as I,\nyou will not be ashamed to cry.\"\n\nUpon the whole I was rather pleased with the old man, and much with all\nabout him.  As evening drew nigh, I told him that I must proceed on my\njourney; whereupon he invited me to tarry with him during the night,\ntelling me that he had a nice room and bed above at my service.  I,\nhowever, declined; and bidding him farewell, mounted my horse, and\ndeparted.  Regaining the road, I proceeded once more in the direction of\nthe north; and, after a few hours, coming to a comfortable public-house,\nI stopped, and put up for the night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nThe Singular Noise--Sleeping in a Meadow--The Book--Cure for\nWakefulness--Literary Tea Party--Poor Byron.\n\nI did not awake till rather late the next morning; and when I did, I felt\nconsiderable drowsiness, with a slight headache, which I was uncharitable\nenough to attribute to the mead which I had drunk on the preceding day.\nAfter feeding my horse, and breakfasting, I proceeded on my wanderings.\nNothing occurred worthy of relating till mid-day was considerably past,\nwhen I came to a pleasant valley, between two gentle hills.  I had\ndismounted, in order to ease my horse, and was leading him along by the\nbridle, when, on my right, behind a bank in which some umbrageous ashes\nwere growing, heard a singular noise.  I stopped short and listened, and\npresently said to myself, \"Surely this is snoring, perhaps that of a\nhedgehog.\"  On further consideration, however, I was convinced that the\nnoise which I heard, and which certainly seemed to be snoring, could not\npossibly proceed from the nostrils of so small an animal, but must rather\ncome from those of a giant, so loud and sonorous was it.  About two or\nthree yards farther was a gate, partly open, to which I went, and peeping\ninto the field, saw a man lying on some rich grass, under the shade of\none of the ashes; he was snoring away at a great rate.  Impelled by\ncuriosity, I fastened the bridle of my horse to the gate, and went up to\nthe man.  He was a genteelly-dressed individual; rather corpulent, with\ndark features, and seemingly about forty-five.  He lay on his back, his\nhat slightly over his brow, and at his right hand lay an open book.  So\nstrenuously did he snore that the wind from his nostrils agitated,\nperceptibly, a fine cambric frill which he wore at his bosom.  I gazed\nupon him for some time, expecting that he might awake; but he did not,\nbut kept on snoring, his breast heaving convulsively.  At last, the noise\nhe made became so terrible, that I felt alarmed for his safety, imagining\nthat a fit might seize him, and he lose his life while fast asleep.  I\ntherefore exclaimed, \"Sir, sir, awake! you sleep over-much.\"  But my\nvoice failed to rouse him, and he continued snoring as before; whereupon\nI touched him slightly with my riding wand, but failing to wake him, I\ntouched him again more vigorously; whereupon he opened his eyes, and,\nprobably imagining himself in a dream, closed them again.  But I was\ndetermined to arouse him, and cried as loud as I could, \"Sir, sir, pray\nsleep no more!\"  He heard what I said, opened his eyes again, stared at\nme with a look of some consciousness, and, half raising himself upon his\nelbows, asked me what was the matter.  \"I beg your pardon,\" said I, \"but\nI took the liberty of awaking you, because you appeared to be much\ndisturbed in your sleep--I was fearful, too, that you might catch a fever\nfrom sleeping under a tree.\"  \"I run no risk,\" said the man, \"I often\ncome and sleep here; and as for being disturbed in my sleep, I felt very\ncomfortable; I wish you had not awoke me.\"  \"Well,\" said I, \"I beg your\npardon once more.  I assure you that what I did was with the best\nintention.\"  \"Oh! pray make no further apology,\" said the individual, \"I\nmake no doubt that what you did was done kindly; but there's an old\nproverb, to the effect, 'that you should let sleeping dogs lie,'\" he\nadded with a smile.  Then, getting up, and stretching himself with a\nyawn, he took up his book and said, \"I have slept quite long enough, and\nit's quite time for me to be going home.\"  \"Excuse my curiosity,\" said I,\n\"if I inquire what may induce you to come and sleep in this meadow?\"  \"To\ntell you the truth,\" answered he, \"I am a bad sleeper.\"  \"Pray pardon\nme,\" said I, \"if I tell you that I never saw one sleep more heartily.\"\n\"If I did so,\" said the individual, \"I am beholden to this meadow and\nthis book; but I am talking riddles, and will explain myself.  I am the\nowner of a very pretty property, of which this valley forms part.  Some\nyears ago, however, up started a person who said the property was his; a\nlawsuit ensued, and I was on the brink of losing my all, when, most\nunexpectedly, the suit was determined in my favour.  Owing, however, to\nthe anxiety to which my mind had been subjected for several years, my\nnerves had become terribly shaken; and no sooner was the trial terminated\nthan sleep forsook my pillow.  I sometimes passed nights without closing\nan eye; I took opiates, but they rather increased than alleviated my\nmalady.  About three weeks ago a friend of mine put this book into my\nhand, and advised me to take it every day to some pleasant part of my\nestate, and try and read a page or two, assuring me, if I did, that I\nshould infallibly fall asleep.  I took his advice, and selecting this\nplace, which I considered the pleasantest part of my property, I came,\nand lying down, commenced reading the book, and before finishing a page\nwas in a dead slumber.  Every day since then I have repeated the\nexperiment, and every time with equal success.  I am a single man,\nwithout any children; and yesterday I made my will, in which, in the\nevent of my friend's surviving me, I have left him all my fortune, in\ngratitude for his having procured for me the most invaluable of all\nblessings--sleep.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" said I, \"how very extraordinary!  Do you think that your going\nto sleep is caused by the meadow or the book?\"  \"I suppose by both,\" said\nmy new acquaintance, \"acting in co-operation.\"  \"It may be so,\" said I;\n\"the magic influence does certainly not proceed from the meadow alone;\nfor since I have been here, I have not felt the slightest inclination to\nsleep.  Does the book consist of prose or poetry?\"  \"It consists of\npoetry,\" said the individual.  \"Not Byron's?\" said I.  \"Byron's!\"\nrepeated the individual, with a smile of contempt; \"no, no; there is\nnothing narcotic in Byron's poetry.  I don't like it.  I used to read it,\nbut it thrilled, agitated, and kept me awake.  No; this is not Byron's\npoetry, but the inimitable ---'s\"--mentioning a name which I had never\nheard till then.  \"Will you permit me to look at it?\" said I.  \"With\npleasure,\" he answered, politely handing me the book.  I took the volume,\nand glanced over the contents.  It was written in blank verse, and\nappeared to abound in descriptions of scenery; there was much mention of\nmountains, valleys, streams, and waterfalls, harebells and daffodils.\nThese descriptions were interspersed with dialogues, which, though they\nproceeded from the mouths of pedlars and rustics, were of the most\nedifying description; mostly on subjects moral or metaphysical, and\ncouched in the most gentlemanly and unexceptionable language, without the\nslightest mixture of vulgarity, coarseness, or pie-bald grammar.  Such\nappeared to me to be the contents of the book; but before I could form a\nvery clear idea of them, I found myself nodding, and a surprising desire\nto sleep coming over me.  Rousing myself, however, by a strong effort, I\nclosed the book, and, returning it to the owner, inquired of him,\n\"Whether he had any motive in coming and lying down in the meadow,\nbesides the wish of enjoying sleep?\"  \"None whatever,\" he replied;\n\"indeed, I should be very glad not to be compelled to do so, always\nprovided I could enjoy the blessing of sleep; for by lying down under\ntrees, I may possibly catch the rheumatism, or be stung by serpents; and,\nmoreover, in the rainy season and winter the thing will be impossible,\nunless I erect a tent, which will possibly destroy the charm.\"  \"Well,\"\nsaid I, \"you need give yourself no further trouble about coming here, as\nI am fully convinced that with this book in your hand, you may go to\nsleep anywhere, as your friend was doubtless aware, though he wished to\ninterest your imagination for a time by persuading you to lie abroad;\ntherefore, in future, whenever you feel disposed to sleep, try to read\nthe book, and you will be sound asleep in a minute; the narcotic\ninfluence lies in the book, and not in the field.\"  \"I will follow your\nadvice,\" said the individual; \"and this very night take it with me to\nbed; though I hope in time to be able to sleep without it, my nerves\nbeing already much quieted from the slumbers I have enjoyed in this\nfield.\"  He then moved towards the gate, where we parted; he going one\nway, and I and my horse the other.\n\nMore than twenty years subsequent to this period, after much wandering\nabout the world, returning to my native country, I was invited to a\nliterary tea-party, where, the discourse turning upon poetry, I, in order\nto show that I was not more ignorant than my neighbours, began to talk\nabout Byron, for whose writings I really entertained considerable\nadmiration, though I had no particular esteem for the man himself.  At\nfirst, I received no answer to what I said--the company merely surveying\nme with a kind of sleepy stare.  At length a lady, about the age of\nforty, with a large wart on her face, observed, in a drawling tone, \"That\nshe had not read Byron--at least, since her girlhood--and then only a few\npassages; but that the impression on her mind was, that his writings were\nof a highly objectionable character.\"  \"I also read a little of him in my\nboyhood,\" said a gentleman about sixty, but who evidently, from his dress\nand demeanour, wished to appear about thirty, \"but I highly disapproved\nof him; for, notwithstanding he was a nobleman, he is frequently very\ncoarse, and very fond of raising emotion.  Now emotion is what I\ndislike;\" drawling out the last syllable of the word dislike.  \"There is\nonly one poet for me--the divine--\" and then he mentioned a name which I\nhad only once heard, and afterwards quite forgotten; the same mentioned\nby the snorer in the field.  \"Ah! there is no one like him!\" murmured\nsome more of the company; \"the poet of nature--of nature without its\nvulgarity.\"  I wished very much to ask these people whether they were\never bad sleepers, and whether they had read the poet, so called, from a\ndesire of being set to sleep.  Within a few days, however, I learnt that\nit had of late become very fashionable and genteel to appear half asleep,\nand that one could exhibit no better mark of superfine breeding than by\noccasionally in company setting one's rhomal organ in action.  I then\nceased to wonder at the popularity, which I found nearly universal, of ---\n's poetry; for, certainly in order to make one's self appear sleepy in\ncompany, or occasionally to induce sleep, nothing could be more\nefficacious than a slight prelection of his poems.  So poor Byron, with\nhis fire and emotion--to say nothing of his mouthings and coxcombry--was\ndethroned, as I prophesied he would be more than twenty years before, on\nthe day of his funeral, though I had little idea that his humiliation\nwould have been brought about by one, whose sole strength consists in\nsetting people to sleep.  Well, all things are doomed to terminate in\nsleep.  Before that termination, however, I will venture to prophesy that\npeople will become a little more awake--snoring and yawning be a little\nless in fashion--and poor Byron be once more reinstated on his throne,\nthough his rival will always stand a good chance of being worshipped by\nthose whose ruined nerves are insensible to the narcotic powers of opium\nand morphine.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nDrivers and Front Outside Passengers--Fatigue of Body and Mind--Unexpected\nGreeting--My Inn--The Governor--Engagement.\n\nI continued my journey, passing through one or two villages.  The day was\nexceedingly hot, and the roads dusty.  In order to cause my horse as\nlittle fatigue as possible, and not to chafe his back, I led him by the\nbridle, my doing which brought upon me a shower of remarks, jests, and\nwould-be witticisms from the drivers and front outside passengers of\nsundry stage-coaches which passed me in one direction or the other.  In\nthis way I proceeded till considerably past noon, when I felt myself very\nfatigued, and my horse appeared no less so; and it is probable that the\nlazy and listless manner in which we were moving on, tired us both much\nmore effectually than hurrying along at a swift trot would have done, for\nI have observed that when the energies of the body are not exerted a\nlanguor frequently comes over it.  At length arriving at a very large\nbuilding with an archway, near the entrance of a town, I sat down on what\nappeared to be a stepping-block, and presently experienced a great\ndepression of spirits.  I began to ask myself whither I was going, and\nwhat I should do with myself and the horse which I held by the bridle?  It\nappeared to me that I was alone in the world with the poor animal, who\nlooked for support to me, who knew not how to support myself.  Then the\nimage of Isopel Berners came into my mind, and when I thought how I had\nlost her for ever, and how happy I might have been with her in the New\nWorld had she not deserted me, I became yet more miserable.\n\nAs I sat in this state of mind, I suddenly felt some one clap me on the\nshoulder, and heard a voice say, \"Ha! comrade of the dingle, what chance\nhas brought you into these parts?\"  I turned round, and beheld a man in\nthe dress of a postillion, whom I instantly recognized as he to whom I\nhad rendered assistance on the night of the storm.\n\n\"Ah!\" said I, \"is it you?  I am glad to see you, for I was feeling very\nlonely and melancholy.\"\n\n\"Lonely and melancholy,\" he replied, \"how is that? how can any one be\nlonely and melancholy with such a noble horse as that you hold by the\nbridle?\"\n\n\"The horse,\" said I, \"is one cause of my melancholy, for I know not in\nthe world what to do with it.\"\n\n\"It is your own?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"I may call it my own, though I borrowed the money to\npurchase it.\"\n\n\"Well, why don't you sell it?\"\n\n\"It is not always easy to find a purchaser for a horse like this,\" said\nI; \"can you recommend me one?\"\n\n\"I?  Why no, not exactly; but you'll find a purchaser shortly--pooh! if\nyou have no other cause for disquiet than that horse, cheer up, man,\ndon't be cast down.  Have you nothing else on your mind?  By the bye,\nwhat's become of the young woman you were keeping company with in that\nqueer lodging place of yours?\"\n\n\"She has left me,\" said I.\n\n\"You quarrelled, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I, \"we did not exactly quarrel, but we are parted.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied he, \"but you will soon come together again.\"\n\n\"No,\" said I, \"we are parted for ever.\"\n\n\"For ever!  Pooh! you little know how people sometimes come together\nagain who think they are parted for ever.  Here's something on that point\nrelating to myself.  You remember, when I told you my story in that\ndingle of yours, that I mentioned a young woman, my fellow-servant when I\nlived with the English family in Mumbo Jumbo's town, and how she and I,\nwhen our foolish governors were thinking of changing their religion,\nagreed to stand by each other, and be true to old Church of England, and\nto give our governors warning, provided they tried to make us renegades.\nWell, she and I parted soon after that, and never to meet again, yet we\nmet the other day in the fields, for she lately came to live with a great\nfamily not far from here, and we have since agreed to marry, to take a\nlittle farm, for we have both a trifle of money, and live together till\n'death us do part.'  So much for parting for ever!  But what do I mean by\nkeeping you broiling in the sun with your horse's bridle in your hand,\nand you on my own ground?  Do you know where you are?  Why, that great\nhouse is my inn, that is, it's my master's, the best fellow in ---.  Come\nalong, you and your horse both will find a welcome at my inn.\"\n\nThereupon he led the way into a large court in which there were coaches,\nchaises, and a great many people; taking my horse from me, he led it into\na nice cool stall, and fastened it to the rack--he then conducted me into\na postillion's keeping-room, which at that time chanced to be empty, and\nhe then fetched a pot of beer and sat down by me.\n\nAfter a little conversation he asked me what I intended to do, and I told\nhim frankly that I did not know; whereupon he observed that, provided I\nhad no objection, he had little doubt that I could be accommodated for\nsome time at his inn.  \"Our upper ostler,\" said he, \"died about a week\nago; he was a clever fellow, and, besides his trade, understood reading\nand accounts.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" said I, interrupting him, \"I am not fitted for the place of\nostler--moreover, I refused the place of ostler at a public-house, which\nwas offered to me only a few days ago.\"  The postillion burst into a\nlaugh.  \"Ostler at a public-house, indeed! why, you would not compare a\nberth at a place like that with the situation of ostler at my inn, the\nfirst road-house in England!  However, I was not thinking of the place of\nostler for you; you are, as you say, not fitted for it, at any rate, not\nat a house like this.  We have, moreover, the best under-ostler in all\nEngland--old Bill, with the drawback that he is rather fond of drink.  We\ncould make shift with him very well, provided we could fall in with a man\nof writing and figures, who could give an account of the hay and corn\nwhich comes in and goes out, and wouldn't object to give a look\noccasionally at the yard.  Now it appears to me that you are just such a\nkind of man, and, if you will allow me to speak to the governor, I don't\ndoubt that he will gladly take you, as he feels kindly disposed towards\nyou from what he has heard me say concerning you.\"\n\n\"And what should I do with my horse?\" said I.\n\n\"The horse need give you no uneasiness,\" said the postillion; \"I know he\nwill be welcome here both for bed and manger, and, perhaps, in a little\ntime you may find a purchaser, as a vast number of sporting people\nfrequent this house.\"  I offered two or three more objections, which the\npostillion overcame with great force of argument, and the pot being\nnearly empty, he drained it to the bottom drop, and then starting up,\nleft me alone.\n\nIn about twenty minutes he returned, accompanied by a highly intelligent-\nlooking individual, dressed in blue and black, with a particularly white\ncravat, and without a hat on his head: this individual, whom I should\nhave mistaken for a gentleman but for the intelligence depicted in his\nface, he introduced to me as the master of the inn.  The master of the\ninn shook me warmly by the hand, told me that he was happy to see me in\nhis house, and thanked me in the handsomest terms for the kindness I had\nshown to his servant in the affair of the thunderstorm.  Then saying that\nhe was informed I was out of employ, he assured me that he should be most\nhappy to engage me to keep his hay and corn account, and as general\nsuperintendent of the yard, and that with respect to the horse, which he\nwas told I had, he begged to inform me that I was perfectly at liberty to\nkeep it at the inn upon the very best, until I could find a\npurchaser,--that with regard to wages--but he had no sooner mentioned\nwages than I cut him short, saying, that provided I stayed I should be\nmost happy to serve him for bed and board, and requested that he would\nallow me until the next morning to consider of his offer; he willingly\nconsented to my request, and, begging that I would call for anything I\npleased, left me alone with the postillion.\n\nI passed that night until about ten o'clock with the postillion, when he\nleft me, having to drive a family about ten miles across the country;\nbefore his departure, however, I told him that I had determined to accept\nthe offer of his governor, as he called him.  At the bottom of my heart I\nwas most happy that an offer had been made, which secured to myself and\nthe animal a comfortable retreat at a moment when I knew not whither in\nthe world to take myself and him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nAn Inn of Times gone by--A First-rate Publican--Hay and\nCorn--Old-fashioned Ostler--Highwaymen--Mounted Police--Grooming.\n\nThe inn, of which I had become an inhabitant, was a place of infinite\nlife and bustle.  Travellers of all descriptions, from all the cardinal\npoints, were continually stopping at it; and to attend to their wants,\nand minister to their convenience, an army of servants, of one\ndescription or other, was kept; waiters, chambermaids, grooms,\npostillions, shoe-blacks, cooks, scullions, and what not, for there was a\nbarber and hair-dresser, who had been at Paris, and talked French with a\ncockney accent; the French sounding all the better, as no accent is so\nmelodious as the cockney.  Jacks creaked in the kitchens turning round\nspits, on which large joints of meat piped and smoked before great big\nfires.  There was running up and down stairs, and along galleries,\nslamming of doors, cries of \"Coming, sir,\" and \"Please to step this way,\nma'am,\" during eighteen hours of the four-and-twenty.  Truly a very great\nplace for life and bustle was this inn.  And often in after life, when\nlonely and melancholy, I have called up the time I spent there, and never\nfailed to become cheerful from the recollection.\n\nI found the master of the house a very kind and civil person.  Before\nbeing an inn-keeper he had been in some other line of business; but on\nthe death of the former proprietor of the inn had married his widow, who\nwas still alive, but, being somewhat infirm, lived in a retired part of\nthe house.  I have said that he was kind and civil; he was, however, not\none of those people who suffer themselves to be made fools of by anybody;\nhe knew his customers, and had a calm, clear eye, which would look\nthrough a man without seeming to do so.  The accommodation of his house\nwas of the very best description; his wines were good, his viands equally\nso, and his charges not immoderate; though he very properly took care of\nhimself.  He was no vulgar inn-keeper, had a host of friends, and\ndeserved them all.  During the time I lived with him, he was presented by\na large assemblage of his friends and customers with a dinner at his own\nhouse, which was very costly, and at which the best of wines were\nsported, and after the dinner with a piece of plate estimated at fifty\nguineas.  He received the plate, made a neat speech of thanks, and when\nthe bill was called for, made another neat speech, in which he refused to\nreceive one farthing for the entertainment, ordering in at the same time\ntwo dozen more of the best champagne, and sitting down amidst uproarious\napplause, and cries of \"You shall be no loser by it!\"  Nothing very\nwonderful in such conduct, some people will say; I don't say there is,\nnor have I any intention to endeavour to persuade the reader that the\nlandlord was a Carlo Boromeo; he merely gave a quid pro quo; but it is\nnot every person who will give you a quid pro quo.  Had he been a vulgar\npublican, he would have sent in a swinging bill after receiving the\nplate; \"but then no vulgar publican would have been presented with\nplate;\" perhaps not, but many a vulgar public character has been\npresented with plate, whose admirers never received a quid pro quo,\nexcept in the shape of a swinging bill.\n\nI found my duties of distributing hay and corn, and keeping an account\nthereof, anything but disagreeable, particularly after I had acquired the\ngood-will of the old ostler, who at first looked upon me with rather an\nevil eye, considering me somewhat in the light of one who had usurped an\noffice which belonged to himself by the right of succession; but there\nwas little gall in the old fellow, and, by speaking kindly to him, never\ngiving myself any airs of assumption; but, above all, by frequently\nreading the newspapers to him--for though passionately fond of news and\npolitics, he was unable to read--I soon succeeded in placing myself on\nexcellent terms with him.  A regular character was that old ostler; he\nwas a Yorkshireman by birth, but had seen a great deal of life in the\nvicinity of London, to which, on the death of his parents, who were very\npoor people, he went at a very early age.  Amongst other places where he\nhad served as ostler was a small inn at Hounslow, much frequented by\nhighwaymen, whose exploits he was fond of narrating, especially those of\nJerry Abershaw, who, he said, was a capital rider; and on hearing his\naccounts of that worthy, I half regretted that the old fellow had not\nbeen in London, and I had not formed his acquaintance about the time I\nwas thinking of writing the life of the said Abershaw, not doubting that\nwith his assistance, I could have produced a book at least as remarkable\nas the life and adventures of that entirely imaginary personage Joseph\nSell; perhaps, however, I was mistaken; and whenever Abershaw's life\nshall appear before the public--and my publisher credibly informs me that\nit has not yet appeared--I beg and entreat the public to state which it\nlikes best, the life of Abershaw, or that of Sell, for which latter work\nI am informed that during the last few months there has been a prodigious\ndemand.  My old friend, however, after talking of Abershaw, would\nfrequently add, that, good rider as Abershaw certainly was, he was\ndecidedly inferior to Richard Ferguson, generally called Galloping Dick,\nwho was a pal of Abershaw's, and had enjoyed a career as long, and nearly\nas remarkable as his own.  I learned from him that both were capital\ncustomers at the Hounslow inn, and that he had frequently drank with them\nin the corn-room.  He said that no man could desire more jolly or\nentertaining companions over a glass of \"summut;\" but that upon the road\nit was anything but desirable to meet them; there they were terrible,\ncursing and swearing, and thrusting the muzzles of their pistols into\npeople's mouths; and at this part of his locution the old man winked, and\nsaid, in a somewhat lower voice, that upon the whole they were right in\ndoing so, and that when a person had once made up his mind to become a\nhighwayman, his best policy was to go the whole hog, fearing nothing, but\nmaking everybody afraid of him; that people never thought of resisting a\nsavage-faced, foul-mouthed highwayman, and if he were taken, were afraid\nto bear witness against him, lest he should get off and cut their throats\nsome time or other upon the roads; whereas people would resist being\nrobbed by a sneaking, pale-visaged rascal, and would swear bodily against\nhim on the first opportunity,--adding, that Abershaw and Ferguson, two\nmost awful fellows, had enjoyed a long career, whereas two disbanded\nofficers of the army, who wished to rob a coach like gentlemen, had\nbegged the passengers' pardon, and talked of hard necessity, had been set\nupon by the passengers themselves, amongst whom were three women, pulled\nfrom their horses, conducted to Maidstone, and hanged with as little pity\nas such contemptible fellows deserved.  \"There is nothing like going the\nwhole hog,\" he repeated, \"and if ever I had been a highwayman, I would\nhave done so; I should have thought myself all the more safe; and,\nmoreover, shouldn't have despised myself.  To curry favour with those you\nare robbing, sometimes at the expense of your own comrades, as I have\nknown fellows do, why, it is the greatest--\"\n\n\"So it is,\" interposed my friend the postillion, who chanced to be\npresent at a considerable part of the old ostler's discourse; \"it is, as\nyou say, the greatest of humbug, and merely, after all, gets a fellow\ninto trouble; but no regular bred highwayman would do it.  I say, George,\ncatch the Pope of Rome trying to curry favour with anybody he robs; catch\nold Mumbo Jumbo currying favour with the Archbishop of Canterbury and the\nDean and Chapter, should he meet them in a stage-coach; it would be with\nhim, Bricconi Abbasso, as he knocked their teeth out with the butt of his\ntrombone; and the old regular-built ruffian would be all the safer for\nit, as Bill would say, as ten to one the Archbishop and Chapter, after\nsuch a spice of his quality, would be afraid to swear against him, and to\nhang him, even if he were in their power, though that would be the proper\nway; for, if it is the greatest of all humbug for a highwayman to curry\nfavour with those he robs, the next greatest is to try to curry favour\nwith a highwayman when you have got him, by letting him off.\"\n\nFinding the old man so well acquainted with the history of highwaymen,\nand taking considerable interest in the subject, having myself edited a\nbook containing the lives of many remarkable people who had figured on\nthe highway, I forthwith asked him how it was that the trade of\nhighwaymen had become extinct in England, as at present we never heard of\nany one following it.  Whereupon he told me that many causes had\ncontributed to bring about that result; the principal of which were the\nfollowing:--the refusal to license houses which were known to afford\nshelter to highwaymen, which, amongst many others, had caused the inn at\nHounslow to be closed; the inclosure of many a wild heath in the country,\non which they were in the habit of lurking, and particularly the\nestablishing in the neighbourhood of London of a well-armed mounted\npatrol, who rode the highwaymen down, and delivered them up to justice,\nwhich hanged them without ceremony.\n\n\"And that would be the way to deal with Mumbo Jumbo and his gang,\" said\nthe postillion, \"should they show their visages in these realms; and I\nhear by the newspapers that they are becoming every day more desperate.\nTake away the license from their public-houses, cut down the rookeries\nand shadowy old avenues in which they are fond of lying in wait, in order\nto sally out upon people as they pass in the roads; but, above all,\nestablish a good mounted police to ride after the ruffians and drag them\nby the scruff of the neck to the next clink, where they might lie till\nthey could be properly dealt with by law; instead of which, the\nGovernment are repealing the wise old laws enacted against such\ncharacters, giving fresh licenses every day to their public-houses, and\nsaying that it would be a pity to cut down their rookeries and thickets\nbecause they look so very picturesque; and, in fact, giving them all kind\nof encouragement; why, if such behaviour is not enough to drive an honest\nman mad, I know not what is.  It is of no use talking, I only wish the\npower were in my hands, and if I did not make short work of them, might I\nbe a mere jackass postillion all the remainder of my life.\"\n\nBesides acquiring from the ancient ostler a great deal of curious\ninformation respecting the ways and habits of the heroes of the road,\nwith whom he had come in contact in the early portion of his life, I\npicked up from him many excellent hints relating to the art of grooming\nhorses.  Whilst at the inn, I frequently groomed the stage and\npost-horses, and those driven up by travellers in their gigs: I was not\ncompelled, nor indeed expected, to do so; but I took pleasure in the\noccupation; and I remember at that period one of the principal objects of\nmy ambition was to be a first-rate groom, and to make the skins of the\ncreatures I took in hand look sleek and glossy like those of moles.  I\nhave said that I derived valuable hints from the old man, and, indeed,\nbecame a very tolerable groom, but there was a certain finishing touch\nwhich I could never learn from him, though he possessed it himself, and\nwhich I could never attain to by my own endeavours; though my want of\nsuccess certainly did not proceed from want of application, for I have\nrubbed the horses down, purring and buzzing all the time, after the\ngenuine ostler fashion, until the perspiration fell in heavy drops upon\nmy shoes, and when I had done my best and asked the old fellow what he\nthought of my work, I could never extract from him more than a kind of\ngrunt, which might be translated, \"Not so very bad, but I have seen a\nhorse groomed much better,\" which leads me to suppose that a person, in\norder to be a first-rate groom, must have something in him when he is\nborn which I had not, and, indeed, which many other people have not who\npretend to be grooms.  What does the reader think?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nStable Hartshorn--How to Manage a Horse on a Journey--Your Best Friend.\n\nOf one thing I am certain, that the reader must be much delighted with\nthe wholesome smell of the stable, with which many of these pages are\nredolent; what a contrast to the sickly odours exhaled from those of some\nof my contemporaries, especially of those who pretend to be of the highly\nfashionable class, and who treat of reception-rooms, well may they be\nstyled so, in which dukes, duchesses, earls, countesses, archbishops,\nbishops, mayors, mayoresses--not forgetting the writers themselves, both\nmale and female--congregate and press upon one another; how cheering, how\nrefreshing, after having been nearly knocked down with such an\natmosphere, to come in contact with genuine stable hartshorn.  Oh! the\nreader shall have yet more of the stable, and of that old ostler, for\nwhich he or she will doubtless exclaim, \"Much obliged!\"--and, lest I\nshould forget to perform my promise, the reader shall have it now.\n\nI shall never forget an harangue from the mouth of the old man, which I\nlistened to one warm evening as he and I sat on the threshold of the\nstable, after having attended to some of the wants of a batch of coach-\nhorses.  It related to the manner in which a gentleman should take care\nof his horse and self, whilst engaged in a journey on horseback, and was\naddressed to myself, on the supposition of my one day coming to an\nestate, and of course becoming a gentleman.\n\n\"When you are a gentleman,\" said he, \"should you ever wish to take a\njourney on a horse of your own, and you could not have a much better than\nthe one you have here eating its fill in the box yonder--I wonder, by the\nbye, how you ever came by it--you can't do better than follow the advice\nI am about to give you, both with respect to your animal and yourself.\nBefore you start, merely give your horse a couple of handfuls of corn and\na little water, somewhat under a quart, and if you drink a pint of water\nyourself out of the pail, you will feel all the better during the whole\nday; then you may walk and trot your animal for about ten miles, till you\ncome to some nice inn, where you may get down and see your horse led into\na nice stall, telling the ostler not to feed him till you come.  If the\nostler happens to be a dog-fancier, and has an English terrier-dog like\nthat of mine there, say what a nice dog it is, and praise its black and\ntawn; and if he does not happen to be a dog-fancier, ask him how he's\ngetting on, and whether he ever knew worse times; that kind of thing will\nplease the ostler, and he will let you do just what you please with your\nown horse, and when your back is turned, he'll say to his comrades what a\nnice gentleman you are, and how he thinks he has seen you before; then go\nand sit down to breakfast, and, before you have finished breakfast, get\nup and go and give your horse a feed of corn; chat with the ostler two or\nthree minutes till your horse has taken the shine out of his corn, which\nwill prevent the ostler taking any of it away when your back is turned,\nfor such things are sometimes done--not that I ever did such a thing\nmyself when I was at the inn at Hounslow.  Oh, dear me, no!  Then go and\nfinish your breakfast, and when you have finished your breakfast and\ncalled for the newspaper, go and water your horse, letting him have one\npailful, then give him another feed of corn, and enter into discourse\nwith the ostler about bull-baiting, the prime minister, and the like; and\nwhen your horse has once more taken the shine out of his corn, go back to\nyour room and your newspaper--and I hope for your sake it may be the\n_Globe_, for that's the best paper going--then pull the bell-rope and\norder in your bill, which you will pay without counting it up--supposing\nyou to be a gentleman.  Give the waiter sixpence, and order out your\nhorse, and when your horse is out, pay for the corn, and give the ostler\na shilling, then mount your horse and walk him gently for five miles; and\nwhilst you are walking him in this manner, it may be as well to tell you\nto take care that you do not let him down and smash his knees, more\nespecially if the road be a particularly good one, for it is not at a\ndesperate hiverman pace, and over very bad roads, that a horse tumbles\nand smashes his knees, but on your particularly nice road, when the horse\nis going gently and lazily, and is half asleep, like the gemman on his\nback; well, at the end of the five miles, when the horse has digested his\nfood, and is all right, you may begin to push your horse on, trotting him\na mile at a heat, and then walking him a quarter of a one, that his wind\nmay be not distressed; and you may go on in that way for thirty miles,\nnever galloping, of course, for none but fools or hivermen ever gallop\nhorses on roads; and at the end of that distance you may stop at some\nother nice inn to dinner.  I say, when your horse is led into the stable,\nafter that same thirty miles' trotting and walking, don't let the saddle\nbe whisked off at once, for if you do your horse will have such a sore\nback as will frighten you, but let your saddle remain on your horse's\nback, with the girths loosened, till after his next feed of corn, and be\nsure that he has no corn, much less water, till after a long hour and\nmore; after he is fed he may be watered to the tune of half a pail, and\nthen the ostler can give him a regular rub down; you may then sit down to\ndinner, and when you have dined get up and see to your horse as you did\nafter breakfast, in fact, you must do much after the same fashion you did\nat t'other inn; see to your horse, and by no means disoblige the ostler.\nSo when you have seen to your horse a second time, you will sit down to\nyour bottle of wine--supposing you to be a gentleman--and after you have\nfinished it, and your argument about the corn-laws with any commercial\ngentleman who happens to be in the room, you may mount your horse\nagain--not forgetting to do the proper thing to the waiter and ostler;\nyou may mount your horse again and ride him, as you did before, for about\nfive and twenty miles, at the end of which you may put up for the night\nafter a very fair day's journey, for no gentleman--supposing he weighs\nsixteen stone, as I suppose you will by the time you become a\ngentleman--ought to ride a horse more than sixty-five miles in one day,\nprovided he has any regard for his horse's back, or his own either.  See\nto your horse at night, and have him well rubbed down.  The next day you\nmay ride your horse forty miles, just as you please, but never foolishly,\nand those forty miles will bring you to your journey's end, unless your\njourney be a plaguy long one, and if so, never ride your horse more than\nfive and thirty miles a day, always, however, seeing him well fed, and\ntaking more care of him than yourself; which is but right and reasonable,\nseeing as how the horse is the best animal of the two.\"\n\n\"When you are a gentleman,\" said he, after a pause, \"the first thing you\nmust think about is to provide yourself with a good horse for your own\nparticular riding; you will, perhaps, keep a coach and pair, but they\nwill be less your own than your lady's, should you have one, and your\nyoung gentry, should you have any; or, if you have neither, for madam,\nyour housekeeper, and the upper female servants; so you need trouble your\nhead less about them, though, of course, you would not like to pay away\nyour money for screws; but be sure you get a good horse for your own\nriding; and that you may have a good chance of having a good one, buy one\nthat's young and has plenty of belly--a little more than the one has\nwhich you now have, though you are not yet a gentleman; you will, of\ncourse, look to his head, his withers, legs and other points, but never\nbuy a horse at any price that has not plenty of belly; no horse that has\nnot belly is ever a good feeder, and a horse that a'n't a good feeder\ncan't be a good horse; never buy a horse that is drawn up in the belly\nbehind; a horse of that description can't feed, and can never carry\nsixteen stone.\n\n\"So when you have got such a horse be proud of it--as I daresay you are\nof the one you have now--and wherever you go swear there a'n't another to\nmatch it in the country, and if anybody gives you the lie, take him by\nthe nose and tweak it off, just as you would do if anybody were to speak\nill of your lady, or, for want of her, of your housekeeper.  Take care of\nyour horse, as you would of the apple of your eye--I am sure I would, if\nI were a gentleman, which I don't ever expect to be, and hardly wish,\nseeing as how I am sixty-nine, and am rather too old to ride--yes,\ncherish and take care of your horse as perhaps the best friend you have\nin the world; for, after all, who will carry you through thick and thin\nas your horse will? not your gentlemen friends, I warrant, nor your upper\nservants, male or female; perhaps your lady would, that is, if she is a\nwhopper, and one of the right sort; the others would be more likely to\ntake up mud and pelt you with it, provided they saw you in trouble, than\nto help you.  So take care of your horse, and feed him every day with\nyour own hands; give him three quarters of a peck of corn each day, mixed\nup with a little hay-chaff, and allow him besides one hundredweight of\nhay in the course of the week; some say that the hay should be hardland\nhay, because it is the wholesomest, but I say, let it be clover hay,\nbecause the horse likes it best; give him through summer and winter, once\na week, a pailful of bran mash, cold in summer and in winter hot; ride\nhim gently about the neighbourhood every day, by which means you will\ngive exercise to yourself and horse, and, moreover, have the satisfaction\nof exhibiting yourself and your horse to advantage, and hearing, perhaps,\nthe men say what a fine horse, and the ladies saying what a fine man:\nnever let your groom mount your horse, as it is ten to one, if you do,\nyour groom will be wishing to show off before company, and will fling\nyour horse down.  I was groom to a gemman before I went to the inn at\nHounslow, and flung him a horse down worth ninety guineas, by\nendeavouring to show off before some ladies that I met on the road.  Turn\nyour horse out to grass throughout May and the first part of June, for\nthen the grass is sweetest, and the flies don't sting so bad as they do\nlater in summer; afterwards merely turn him out occasionally in the swale\nof the morn and the evening; after September the grass is good for\nlittle, lash and sour at best; every horse should go out to grass, if not\nhis blood becomes full of greasy humours, and his wind is apt to become\naffected, but he ought to be kept as much as possible from the heat and\nflies, always got up at night, and never turned out late in the\nyear--Lord! if I had always such a nice attentive person to listen to me\nas you are, I could go on talking about 'orses to the end of time.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nThe Stage--Coachmen of England--A Bully Served Out--Broughton's Guard--The\nBrazen Head.\n\nI lived on very good terms, not only with the master and the old ostler,\nbut with all the domestics and hangers on at the inn; waiters,\nchambermaids, cooks, and scullions, not forgetting the \"boots,\" of which\nthere were three.  As for the postillions, I was sworn brother with them\nall, and some of them went so far as to swear that I was the best fellow\nin the world; for which high opinion entertained by them of me, I believe\nI was principally indebted to the good account their comrade gave of me,\nwhom I had so hospitably received in the dingle.  I repeat that I lived\non good terms with all the people connected with the inn, and was noticed\nand spoken kindly to by some of the guests--especially by that class\ntermed commercial travellers--all of whom were great friends and\npatronizers of the landlord, and were the principal promoters of the\ndinner, and subscribers to the gift of plate, which I have already spoken\nof, the whole fraternity striking me as the jolliest set of fellows\nimaginable, the best customers to an inn, and the most liberal to\nservants; there was one description of persons, however, frequenting the\ninn, which I did not like at all, and which I did not get on well with,\nand these people were the stage-coachmen.\n\nThe stage-coachmen of England, at the time of which I am speaking,\nconsidered themselves mighty fine gentry, nay, I verily believe the most\nimportant personages of the realm, and their entertaining this high\nopinion of themselves can scarcely be wondered at; they were low fellows,\nbut masters at driving; driving was in fashion, and sprigs of nobility\nused to dress as coachmen and imitate the slang and behaviour of the\ncoachmen, from whom occasionally they would take lessons in driving as\nthey sat beside them on the box, which post of honour any sprig of\nnobility who happened to take a place on a coach claimed as his\nunquestionable right; and these sprigs would smoke cigars and drink\nsherry with the coachmen in bar-rooms, and on the road; and, when bidding\nthem farewell, would give them a guinea or a half-guinea, and shake them\nby the hand, so that these fellows, being low fellows, very naturally\nthought no small liquor of themselves, but would talk familiarly of their\nfriends lords so and so, the honourable misters so and so, and Sir Harry\nand Sir Charles, and be wonderfully saucy to any one who was not a lord,\nor something of the kind; and this high opinion of themselves received\ndaily augmentation from the servile homage paid them by the generality of\nthe untitled male passengers, especially those on the fore part of the\ncoach, who used to contend for the honour of sitting on the box with the\ncoachman when no sprig was nigh to put in his claim.  Oh! what servile\nhomage these craven creatures did pay these same coach fellows, more\nespecially after witnessing this or t'other act of brutality practised\nupon the weak and unoffending--upon some poor friendless woman travelling\nwith but little money, and perhaps a brace of hungry children with her,\nor upon some thin and half-starved man travelling on the hind part of the\ncoach from London to Liverpool with only eighteen pence in his pocket\nafter his fare was paid, to defray his expenses on the road; for as the\ninsolence of these knights was vast, so was their rapacity enormous; they\nhad been so long accustomed to have crowns and half-crowns rained upon\nthem by their admirers and flatterers, that they would look at a\nshilling, for which many an honest labourer was happy to toil for ten\nhours under a broiling sun, with the utmost contempt; would blow upon it\nderisively, or fillip it into the air before they pocketed it; but when\nnothing was given them, as would occasionally happen--for how could they\nreceive from those who had nothing? and nobody was bound to give them\nanything, as they had certain wages from their employers--then what a\nscene would ensue!  Truly the brutality and rapacious insolence of\nEnglish coachmen had reached a climax; it was time that these fellows\nshould be disenchanted, and the time--thank Heaven!--was not far distant.\nLet the craven dastards who used to curry favour with them, and applaud\ntheir brutality, lament their loss now that they and their vehicles have\ndisappeared from the roads; I, who have ever been an enemy to insolence,\ncruelty, and tyranny, loathe their memory, and, what is more, am not\nafraid to say so, well aware of the storm of vituperation, partly learnt\nfrom them, which I may expect from those who used to fall down and\nworship them.\n\nAmongst the coachmen who frequented the inn was one who was called \"the\nbang-up coachman.\"  He drove to our inn, in the fore part of every day,\none of what were called the fast coaches, and afterwards took back the\ncorresponding vehicle.  He stayed at our house about twenty minutes,\nduring which time the passengers of the coach which he was to return with\ndined; those at least who were inclined for dinner, and could pay for it.\nHe derived his sobriquet of \"the bang-up coachman\" partly from his being\ndressed in the extremity of coach dandyism, and partly from the peculiar\ninsolence of his manner, and the unmerciful fashion in which he was in\nthe habit of lashing on the poor horses committed to his charge.  He was\na large tall fellow, of about thirty, with a face which, had it not been\nbloated by excess, and insolence and cruelty stamped most visibly upon\nit, might have been called good-looking.  His insolence indeed was so\ngreat, that he was hated by all the minor fry connected with coaches\nalong the road upon which he drove, especially the ostlers, whom he was\ncontinually abusing or finding fault with.  Many was the hearty curse\nwhich he received when his back was turned; but the generality of people\nwere much afraid of him, for he was a swinging strong fellow, and had the\nreputation of being a fighter, and in one or two instances had beaten in\na barbarous manner individuals who had quarrelled with him.\n\nI was nearly having a fracas with this worthy.  One day, after he had\nbeen drinking sherry with a sprig, he swaggered into the yard where I\nhappened to be standing; just then a waiter came by carrying upon a tray\npart of a splendid Cheshire cheese, with a knife, plate, and napkin.\nStopping the waiter, the coachman cut with the knife a tolerably large\nlump out of the very middle of the cheese, stuck it on the end of the\nknife, and putting it to his mouth nibbled a slight piece off it, and\nthen, tossing the rest away with disdain, flung the knife down upon the\ntray, motioning the waiter to proceed; \"I wish,\" said I, \"you may not\nwant before you die what you have just flung away,\" whereupon the fellow\nturned furiously towards me; just then, however, his coach being standing\nat the door, there was a cry for coachman, so that he was forced to\ndepart, contenting himself for the present with shaking his fist at me,\nand threatening to serve me out on the first opportunity; before,\nhowever, the opportunity occurred he himself got served out in a most\nunexpected manner.\n\nThe day after this incident he drove his coach to the inn, and after\nhaving dismounted and received the contributions of the generality of the\npassengers, he strutted up, with a cigar in his mouth, to an individual\nwho had come with him, and who had just asked me a question with respect\nto the direction of a village about three miles off, to which he was\ngoing.  \"Remember the coachman,\" said the knight of the box to this\nindividual, who was a thin person of about sixty, with a white hat,\nrather shabby black coat, and buff-coloured trousers, and who held an\numbrella and a small bundle in his hand.  \"If you expect me to give you\nanything,\" said he to the coachman, \"you are mistaken; I will give you\nnothing.  You have been very insolent to me as I rode behind you on the\ncoach, and have encouraged two or three trumpery fellows, who rode along\nwith you, to cut scurvy jokes at my expense, and now you come to me for\nmoney; I am not so poor, but I could have given you a shilling had you\nbeen civil; as it is, I will give you nothing.\"  \"Oh! you won't, won't\nyou?\" said the coachman; \"dear me!  I hope I shan't starve because you\nwon't give me anything--a shilling! why, I could afford to give you\ntwenty if I thought fit, you pauper! civil to you, indeed! things are\ncome to a fine pass if I need be civil to you!  Do you know who you are\nspeaking to? why, the best lords in the country are proud to speak to me.\nWhy, it was only the other day that the Marquis of--said to me--\" and\nthen he went on to say what the Marquis said to him; after which,\nflinging down his cigar, he strutted up the road, swearing to himself\nabout paupers.\n\n\"You say it is three miles to ---,\" said the individual to me; \"I think I\nshall light my pipe, and smoke it as I go along.\"  Thereupon he took out\nfrom a side-pocket a tobacco-box and short meerschaum pipe, and\nimplements for striking a light, filled his pipe, lighted it, and\ncommenced smoking.  Presently the coachman drew near.  I saw at once that\nthere was mischief in his eye; the man smoking was standing with his back\ntowards him, and he came so nigh to him, seemingly purposely, that as he\npassed a puff of smoke came of necessity against his face.  \"What do you\nmean by smoking in my face?\" said he, striking the pipe of the elderly\nindividual out of his mouth.  The other, without manifesting much\nsurprise, said, \"I thank you; and if you will wait a minute, I will give\nyou a receipt for that favour;\" then gathering up his pipe, and taking\noff his coat and hat, he laid them on a stepping-block which stood near,\nand rubbing his hands together, he advanced towards the coachman in an\nattitude of offence, holding his hands crossed very near to his face.  The\ncoachman, who probably expected anything but such a movement from a\nperson of the age and appearance of the individual whom he had insulted,\nstood for a moment motionless with surprise; but, recollecting himself,\nhe pointed at him derisively with his finger; the next moment, however,\nthe other was close upon him, had struck aside the extended hand with his\nleft fist, and given him a severe blow on the nose with his right, which\nhe immediately followed by a left-hand blow in the eye; then drawing his\nbody slightly backward, with the velocity of lightning he struck the\ncoachman full in the mouth, and the last blow was the severest of all,\nfor it cut the coachman's lips nearly through; blows so quickly and\nsharply dealt I had never seen.  The coachman reeled like a fir-tree in a\ngale, and seemed nearly unsensed.  \"Ho! what's this? a fight! a fight!\"\nsounded from a dozen voices, and people came running from all directions\nto see what was going on.  The coachman, coming somewhat to himself,\ndisencumbered himself of his coat and hat; and, encouraged by two or\nthree of his brothers of the whip, showed some symptoms of fighting,\nendeavouring to close with his foe, but the attempt was vain, for his foe\nwas not to be closed with; he did not shift or dodge about, but warded\noff the blows of his opponent with the greatest sang-froid, always using\nthe guard which I have already described, and putting in, in return,\nshort chopping blows with the swiftness of lightning.  In a very few\nminutes the countenance of the coachman was literally cut to pieces, and\nseveral of his teeth were dislodged; at length he gave in; stung with\nmortification, however, he repented, and asked for another round; it was\ngranted, to his own complete demolition.  The coachman did not drive his\ncoach back that day, he did not appear on the box again for a week; but\nhe never held up his head afterwards.  Before I quitted the inn, he had\ndisappeared from the road, going no one knew where.\n\nThe coachman, as I have said before, was very much disliked upon the\nroad, but there was an esprit de corps amongst the coachmen, and those\nwho stood by did not like to see their brother chastised in such\ntremendous fashion.  \"I never saw such a fight before,\" said one.  \"Fight!\nwhy, I don't call it a fight at all; this chap here ha'n't got a scratch,\nwhereas Tom is cut to pieces; it is all along of that guard of his; if\nTom could have got within his guard he would have soon served the old\nchap out.\"  \"So he would,\" said another, \"it was all owing to that guard.\nHowever, I think I see into it, and if I had not to drive this afternoon,\nI would have a turn with the old fellow and soon serve him out.\"  \"I will\nfight him now for a guinea,\" said the other coachman, half taking off his\ncoat; observing, however, that the elderly individual made a motion\ntowards him, he hitched it upon his shoulder again, and added, \"that is,\nif he had not been fighting already, but as it is, I am above taking an\nadvantage, especially of such a poor old creature as that.\"  And when he\nhad said this, he looked around him, and there was a feeble titter of\napprobation from two or three of the craven crew, who were in the habit\nof currying favour with the coachmen.  The elderly individual looked for\na moment at these last, and then said, \"To such fellows as you I have\nnothing to say;\" then turning to the coachmen, \"and as for you,\" he said,\n\"ye cowardly bullies, I have but one word, which is, that your reign upon\nthe roads is nearly over, and that a time is coming when ye will no\nlonger be wanted or employed in your present capacity, when ye will\neither have to drive dung-carts, assist as ostlers at village ale-houses,\nor rot in the workhouse.\"  Then putting on his coat and hat, and taking\nup his bundle, not forgetting his meerschaum, and the rest of his smoking\napparatus, he departed on his way.  Filled with curiosity, I followed\nhim.\n\n\"I am quite astonished that you should be able to use your hands in the\nway you have done,\" said I, as I walked with this individual in the\ndirection in which he was bound.\n\n\"I will tell you how I became able to do so,\" said the elderly\nindividual, proceeding to fill and light his pipe as he walked along.  \"My\nfather was a journeyman engraver, who lived in a very riotous\nneighbourhood in the outskirts of London.  Wishing to give me something\nof an education, he sent me to a day-school, two or three streets distant\nfrom where we lived, and there, being rather a puny boy, I suffered much\npersecution from my schoolfellows, who were a very blackguard set.  One\nday, as I was running home, with one of my tormentors pursuing me, old\nSergeant Broughton, the retired fighting-man, seized me by the arm--\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" said I, \"has it ever been your luck to be acquainted with\nSergeant Broughton?\"\n\n\"You may well call it luck,\" said the elderly individual; \"but for him I\nshould never have been able to make my way through the world.  He lived\nonly four doors from our house; so, as I was running along the street,\nwith my tyrant behind me, Sergeant Broughton seized me by the arm.  'Stop,\nmy boy,' said he; 'I have frequently seen that scamp ill-treating you;\nnow I will teach you how to send him home with a bloody nose; down with\nyour bag of books; and now, my game chick,' whispered he to me, placing\nhimself between me and my adversary, so that he could not observe his\nmotions; 'clench your fist in this manner, and hold your arms in this,\nand when he strikes at you, move them as I now show you, and he can't\nhurt you; now, don't be afraid, but go at him.'  I confess that I was\nsomewhat afraid, but I considered myself in some degree under the\nprotection of the famous Sergeant, and, clenching my fist, I went at my\nfoe, using the guard which my ally recommended.  The result corresponded\nto a certain degree with the predictions of the Sergeant; I gave my foe a\nbloody nose and a black eye, though, notwithstanding my recent lesson in\nthe art of self-defence, he contrived to give me two or three clumsy\nblows.  From that moment I was the especial favourite of the Sergeant,\nwho gave me further lessons, so that in a little time I became a very\nfair boxer, beating everybody of my own size who attacked me.  The old\ngentleman, however, made me promise never to be quarrelsome, nor to turn\nhis instructions to account, except in self-defence.  I have always borne\nin mind my promise, and have made it a point of conscience never to fight\nunless absolutely compelled.  Folks may rail against boxing if they\nplease, but being able to box may sometimes stand a quiet man in good\nstead.  How should I have fared to-day, but for the instructions of\nSergeant Broughton?  But for them, the brutal ruffian who insulted me\nmust have passed unpunished.  He will not soon forget the lesson which I\nhave just given him--the only lesson he could understand.  What would\nhave been the use of reasoning with a fellow of that description?  Brave\nold Broughton!  I owe him much.\"\n\n\"And your manner of fighting,\" said I, \"was the manner employed by\nSergeant Broughton?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said my new acquaintance; \"it was the manner in which he beat\nevery one who attempted to contend with him, till, in an evil hour, he\nentered the ring with Slack, without any training or preparation, and by\na chance blow lost the battle to a man who had been beaten with ease by\nthose who, in the hands of Broughton, appeared like so many children.  It\nwas the way of fighting of him who first taught Englishmen to box\nscientifically, who was the head and father of the fighters of what is\nnow called the old school, the last of which were Johnson and Big Ben.\"\n\n\"A wonderful man, that Big Ben,\" said I.\n\n\"He was so,\" said the elderly individual; \"but had it not been for\nBroughton, I question whether Ben would have ever been the fighter he\nwas.  Oh! there was no one like old Broughton; but for him I should at\nthe present moment be sneaking along the road, pursued by the hissings\nand hootings of the dirty flatterers of that blackguard coachman.\"\n\n\"What did you mean,\" said I, \"by those words of yours, that the coachmen\nwould speedily disappear from the roads?\"\n\n\"I meant,\" said he, \"that a new method of travelling is about to be\nestablished, which will supersede the old.  I am a poor engraver, as my\nfather was before me; but engraving is an intellectual trade, and by\nfollowing it, I have been brought in contact with some of the cleverest\nmen in England.  It has even made me acquainted with the projector of the\nscheme, which he has told me many of the wisest heads of England have\nbeen dreaming of during a period of six hundred years, and which it seems\nwas alluded to by a certain Brazen Head in the story-book of Friar Bacon,\nwho is generally supposed to have been a wizard, but in reality was a\ngreat philosopher.  Young man, in less than twenty years, by which time I\nshall be dead and gone, England will be surrounded with roads of metal,\non which armies may travel with mighty velocity, and of which the walls\nof brass and iron by which the friar proposed to defend his native land\nare the types.\"  He then, shaking me by the hand, proceeded on his way,\nwhilst I returned to the inn.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nFrancis Ardry--His Misfortunes--Dog and Lion Fight--Great Men of the\nWorld.\n\nA few days after the circumstance which I have last commemorated, it\nchanced that, as I was standing at the door of the inn, one of the\nnumerous stage-coaches which were in the habit of stopping there, drove\nup, and several passengers got down.  I had assisted a woman with a\ncouple of children to dismount, and had just delivered to her a band-box,\nwhich appeared to be her only property, which she had begged me to fetch\ndown from the roof, when I felt a hand laid upon my shoulder, and heard a\nvoice exclaim, \"Is it possible, old fellow, that I find you in this\nplace?\"  I turned round, and, wrapped in a large blue cloak, I beheld my\ngood friend Francis Ardry.  I shook him most warmly by the hand, and\nsaid, \"If you are surprised to see me, I am no less so to see you; where\nare you bound to?\"\n\n\"I am bound for L-; at any rate, I am booked for that sea-port,\" said my\nfriend in reply.\n\n\"I am sorry for it,\" said I, \"for in that case we shall have to part in a\nquarter of an hour, the coach by which you came stopping no longer.\"\n\n\"And whither are you bound?\" demanded my friend.\n\n\"I am stopping at present in this house, quite undetermined as to what to\ndo.\"\n\n\"Then come along with me,\" said Francis Ardry.\n\n\"That I can scarcely do,\" said I; \"I have a horse in the stall which I\ncannot afford to ruin by racing to L--- by the side of your coach.\"\n\nMy friend mused for a moment: \"I have no particular business at L---,\"\nsaid he; \"I was merely going thither to pass a day or two, till an\naffair, in which I am deeply interested, at C--- shall come off.  I think\nI shall stay with you for four-and-twenty hours at least; I have been\nrather melancholy of late, and cannot afford to part with a friend like\nyou at the present moment; it is an unexpected piece of good fortune to\nhave met you; and I have not been very fortunate of late,\" he added,\nsighing.\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I am glad to see you once more, whether fortunate, or\nnot; where is your baggage?\"\n\n\"Yon trunk is mine,\" said Francis, pointing to a trunk of black Russian\nleather upon the coach.\n\n\"We will soon have it down,\" said I; and at a word which I gave to one of\nthe hangers-on of the inn, the trunk was taken from the top of the coach.\n\"Now,\" said I to Francis Ardry, \"follow me, I am a person of some\nauthority in this house;\" thereupon I led Francis Ardry into the house,\nand a word which I said to a waiter forthwith installed Francis Ardry in\na comfortable private sitting-room, and his trunk in the very best\nsleeping-room of our extensive establishment.\n\nIt was now about one o'clock: Francis Ardry ordered dinner for two, to be\nready at four, and a pint of sherry to be brought forthwith, which I\nrequested my friend the waiter might be the very best, and which in\neffect turned out as I requested; we sat down, and when we had drunk to\neach other's health, Frank requested me to make known to him how I had\ncontrived to free myself from my embarrassments in London, what I had\nbeen about since I quitted that city, and the present posture of my\naffairs.\n\nI related to Francis Ardry how I had composed the Life of Joseph Sell,\nand how the sale of it to the bookseller had enabled me to quit London\nwith money in my pocket, which had supported me during a long course of\nramble in the country, into the particulars of which I, however, did not\nenter with any considerable degree of fulness.  I summed up my account by\nsaying that \"I was at present a kind of overlooker in the stables of the\ninn, had still some pounds in my purse, and, moreover, a capital horse in\nthe stall.\"\n\n\"No very agreeable posture of affairs,\" said Francis Ardry, looking\nrather seriously at me.\n\n\"I make no complaints,\" said I, \"my prospects are not very bright, it is\ntrue, but sometimes I have visions both waking and sleeping, which,\nthough always strange, are invariably agreeable.  Last night, in my\nchamber near the hayloft, I dreamt that I had passed over an almost\ninterminable wilderness--an enormous wall rose before me, the wall,\nmethought, was the great wall of China:--strange figures appeared to be\nbeckoning to me from the top of the wall; such visions are not exactly to\nbe sneered at.  Not that such phantasmagoria,\" said I, raising my voice,\n\"are to be compared for a moment with such desirable things as fashion,\nfine clothes, cheques from uncles, parliamentary interest, the love of\nsplendid females.  Ah! woman's love,\" said I, and sighed.\n\n\"What's the matter with the fellow?\" said Francis Ardry.\n\n\"There is nothing like it,\" said I.\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"Love, divine love,\" said I.\n\n\"Confound love,\" said Francis Ardry, \"I hate the very name; I have made\nmyself a pretty fool by it, but trust me for ever being at such folly\nagain.  In an evil hour I abandoned my former pursuits and amusements for\nit; in one morning spent at Joey's there was more real pleasure than in--\"\n\n\"Surely,\" said I, \"you are not hankering after dog-fighting again, a\nsport which none but the gross and unrefined care anything for?  No,\none's thoughts should be occupied by something higher and more rational\nthan dog-fighting; and what better than love--divine love?  Oh, there's\nnothing like it!\"\n\n\"Pray, don't talk nonsense,\" said Francis Ardry.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said I; \"why I was repeating, to the best of my recollection,\nwhat I heard you say on a former occasion.\"\n\n\"If ever I talked such stuff,\" said Francis Ardry, \"I was a fool; and\nindeed I cannot deny that I have been one: no, there's no denying that I\nhave been a fool.  What do you think? that false Annette has cruelly\nabandoned me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"perhaps you have yourself to thank for her having done\nso; did you never treat her with coldness, and repay her marks of\naffectionate interest with strange fits of eccentric humour?\"\n\n\"Lord! how little you know of women,\" said Francis Ardry; \"had I done as\nyou suppose, I should probably have possessed her at the present moment.\nI treated her in a manner diametrically opposite to that.  I loaded her\nwith presents, was always most assiduous to her, always at her feet, as I\nmay say, yet she nevertheless abandoned me--and for whom?  I am almost\nashamed to say--for a fiddler.\"\n\nI took a glass of wine, Francis Ardry followed my example, and then\nproceeded to detail to me the treatment which he had experienced from\nAnnette, and from what he said, it appeared that her conduct to him had\nbeen in the highest degree reprehensible; notwithstanding he had indulged\nher in everything, she was never civil to him, but loaded him continually\nwith taunts and insults, and had finally, on his being unable to supply\nher with a sum of money which she had demanded, decamped from the\nlodgings which he had taken for her, carrying with her all the presents\nwhich at various times he had bestowed upon her, and had put herself\nunder the protection of a gentleman who played the bassoon at the Italian\nOpera, at which place it appeared that her sister had lately been engaged\nas a danseuse.  My friend informed me that at first he had experienced\ngreat agony at the ingratitude of Annette, but at last had made up his\nmind to forget her, and, in order more effectually to do so, had left\nLondon with the intention of witnessing a fight, which was shortly coming\noff at a town in these parts, between some dogs and a lion; which combat,\nhe informed me, had for some time past been looked forward to with\nintense eagerness by the gentlemen of the sporting world.\n\nI commended him for his resolution, at the same time advising him not to\ngive up his mind entirely to dog-fighting, as he had formerly done, but,\nwhen the present combat should be over, to return to his rhetorical\nstudies, and above all to marry some rich and handsome lady on the first\nopportunity, as, with his person and expectations, he had only to sue for\nthe hand of the daughter of a marquis to be successful, telling him, with\na sigh, that all women were not Annettes, and that, upon the whole, there\nwas nothing like them.  To which advice he answered, that he intended to\nreturn to rhetoric as soon as the lion fight should be over, but that he\nnever intended to marry, having had enough of women; adding that he was\nglad he had no sister, as, with the feelings which he entertained with\nrespect to her sex, he should be unable to treat her with common\naffection, and concluded by repeating a proverb which he had learnt from\nan Arab whom he had met at Venice, to the effect, that, \"one who has been\nstung by a snake, shivers at the sight of a sting.\"\n\nAfter a little more conversation, we strolled to the stable, where my\nhorse was standing; my friend, who was a connoisseur in horseflesh,\nsurveyed the animal with attention, and after inquiring where and how I\nhad obtained him, asked what I intended to do with him; on my telling him\nthat I was undetermined, and that I was afraid the horse was likely to\nprove a burden to me, he said, \"It is a noble animal, and if you mind\nwhat you are about, you may make a small fortune by him.  I do not want\nsuch an animal myself, nor do I know any one who does; but a great horse-\nfair will be held shortly at a place where, it is true, I have never\nbeen, but of which I have heard a great deal from my acquaintances, where\nit is said a first-rate horse is always sure to fetch its value; that\nplace is Horncastle, in Lincolnshire, you should take him thither.\"\n\nFrancis Ardry and myself dined together, and after dinner partook of a\nbottle of the best port which the inn afforded.  After a few glasses, we\nhad a great deal of conversation; I again brought the subject of marriage\nand love, divine love, upon the carpet, but Francis almost immediately\nbegged me to drop it; and on my having the delicacy to comply, he\nreverted to dog-fighting, on which he talked well and learnedly; amongst\nother things, he said it was a princely sport of great antiquity, and\nquoted from Quintus Curtius to prove that the princes of India must have\nbeen of the fancy, they having, according to that author, treated\nAlexander to a fight between certain dogs and a lion.  Becoming,\nnotwithstanding my friend's eloquence and learning, somewhat tired of the\nsubject, I began to talk about Alexander.  Francis Ardry said he was one\nof the two great men whom the world has produced, the other being\nNapoleon; I replied that I believed Tamerlane was a greater man than\neither; but Francis Ardry knew nothing of Tamerlane, save what he had\ngathered from the play of Timour the Tartar.  \"No,\" said he, \"Alexander\nand Napoleon are the great men of the world, their names are known\neverywhere.  Alexander has been dead upwards of two thousand years, but\nthe very English bumpkins sometimes christen their boys by the name of\nAlexander--can there be a greater evidence of his greatness?  As for\nNapoleon, there are some parts of India in which his bust is worshipped.\"\nWishing to make up a triumvirate, I mentioned the name of Wellington, to\nwhich Francis Ardry merely said, \"bah!\" and resumed the subject of dog-\nfighting.\n\nFrancis Ardry remained at the inn during that day and the next, and then\ndeparted to the dog and lion fight; I never saw him afterwards, and\nmerely heard of him once after a lapse of some years, and what I then\nheard was not exactly what I could have wished to hear.  He did not make\nmuch of the advantages which he possessed, a pity, for how great were\nthose advantages--person, intellect, eloquence, connection, riches! yet,\nwith all these advantages, one thing highly needful seems to have been\nwanting in Francis.  A desire, a craving, to perform something great and\ngood.  Oh! what a vast deal may be done with intellect, courage, riches,\naccompanied by the desire of doing something great and good!  Why, a\nperson may carry the blessings of civilization and religion to barbarous,\nyet at the same time beautiful and romantic lands; and what a triumph\nthere is for him who does so! what a crown of glory! of far greater value\nthan those surrounding the brows of your mere conquerors.  Yet who has\ndone so in these times?  Not many; not three, not two, something seems to\nhave been always wanting; there is, however, one instance, in which the\nvarious requisites have been united, and the crown, the most desirable in\nthe world--at least which I consider to be the most desirable--achieved,\nand only one, that of Brooke of Borneo.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nMr. Platitude and the Man in Black--The Postillion's Adventures--The Lone\nHouse--A Goodly Assemblage.\n\nIt never rains, but it pours.  I was destined to see at this inn more\nacquaintances than one.  On the day of Francis Ardry's departure, shortly\nafter he had taken leave of me, as I was standing in the corn-chamber, at\na kind of writing-table or desk, fastened to the wall, with a book before\nme, in which I was making out an account of the corn and hay lately\nreceived and distributed, my friend the postillion came running in out of\nbreath.  \"Here they both are,\" he gasped out; \"pray do come and look at\nthem.\"\n\n\"Whom do you mean?\" said I.\n\n\"Why, that red-haired Jack Priest, and that idiotic parson, Platitude;\nthey have just been set down by one of the coaches, and want a postchaise\nto go across the country in; and what do you think?  I am to have the\ndriving of them.  I have no time to lose, for I must get myself ready; so\ndo come and look at them.\"\n\nI hastened into the yard of the inn; two or three of the helpers of our\nestablishment were employed in drawing forward a postchaise out of the\nchaise-house, which occupied one side of the yard, and which was spacious\nenough to contain nearly twenty of these vehicles, though it was never\nfull, several of them being always out upon the roads, as the demand upon\nus for postchaises across the country was very great.  \"There they are,\"\nsaid the postillion, softly, nodding towards two individuals, in one of\nwhom I recognized the man in black, and in the other Mr. Platitude;\n\"there they are; have a good look at them, while I go and get ready.\"  The\nman in black and Mr. Platitude were walking up and down the yard, Mr.\nPlatitude was doing his best to make himself appear ridiculous, talking\nvery loudly in exceedingly bad Italian, evidently for the purpose of\nattracting the notice of the bystanders, in which he succeeded, all the\nstable-boys and hangers-on about the yard, attracted by his vociferation,\ngrinning at his ridiculous figure as he limped up and down.  The man in\nblack said little or nothing, but from the glances which he cast sideways\nappeared to be thoroughly ashamed of his companion; the worthy couple\npresently arrived close to where I was standing, and the man in black,\nwho was nearest to me, perceiving me, stood still as if hesitating, but\nrecovering himself in a moment, he moved on without taking any farther\nnotice; Mr. Platitude exclaimed as they passed in broken lingo, \"I hope\nwe shall find the holy doctors all assembled,\" and as they returned, \"I\nmake no doubt that they will all be rejoiced to see me.\"  Not wishing to\nbe standing an idle gazer, I went to the chaise and assisted in attaching\nthe horses, which had now been brought out, to the pole.  The postillion\npresently arrived, and finding all ready took the reins and mounted the\nbox, whilst I very politely opened the door for the two travellers; Mr.\nPlatitude got in first, and, without taking any notice of me, seated\nhimself on the farther side.  In got the man in black, and seated himself\nnearest to me.  \"All is right,\" said I, as I shut the door, whereupon the\npostillion cracked his whip, and the chaise drove out of the yard.  Just\nas I shut the door, however, and just as Mr. Platitude had recommenced\ntalking in jergo, at the top of his voice, the man in black turned his\nface partly towards me, and gave me a wink with his left eye.\n\nI did not see my friend the postillion till the next morning, when he\ngave me an account of the adventures he had met with on his expedition.\nIt appeared that he had driven the man in black and the Reverend\nPlatitude across the country by roads and lanes which he had some\ndifficulty in threading.  At length, when he had reached a part of the\ncountry where he had never been before, the man in black pointed out to\nhim a house near the corner of a wood, to which he informed him they were\nbound.  The postillion said it was a strange-looking house, with a wall\nround it; and, upon the whole, bore something of the look of a madhouse.\nThere was already a postchaise at the gate, from which three individuals\nhad alighted--one of them the postillion said was a mean-looking\nscoundrel, with a regular petty-larceny expression in his countenance.  He\nwas dressed very much like the man in black, and the postillion said that\nhe could almost have taken his Bible oath that they were both of the same\nprofession.  The other two he said were parsons, he could swear that,\nthough he had never seen them before; there could be no mistake about\nthem.  Church of England parsons the postillion swore they were, with\ntheir black coats, white cravats, and airs, in which clumsiness and\nconceit were most funnily blended--Church of England parsons of the\nPlatitude description, who had been in Italy, and seen the Pope, and\nkissed his toe, and picked up a little broken Italian, and come home\ngreater fools than they went forth.  It appeared that they were all\nacquaintances of Mr. Platitude, for when the postillion had alighted and\nlet Mr. Platitude and his companion out of the chaise, Mr. Platitude\nshook the whole three by the hand, conversed with his two brothers in a\nlittle broken jergo, and addressed the petty-larceny looking individual\nby the title of Reverend Doctor.  In the midst of these greetings,\nhowever, the postillion said the man in black came up to him, and\nproceeded to settle with him for the chaise; he had shaken hands with\nnobody, and had merely nodded to the others; \"and now,\" said the\npostillion, \"he evidently wished to get rid of me, fearing, probably,\nthat I should see too much of the nonsense that was going on.  It was\nwhilst settling with me that he seemed to recognize me for the first\ntime, for he stared hard at me, and at last asked whether I had not been\nin Italy; to which question, with a nod and a laugh, I replied that I\nhad.  I was then going to ask him about the health of the image of Holy\nMary, and to say that I hoped it had recovered from its horsewhipping;\nbut he interrupted me, paid me the money for the fare, and gave me a\ncrown for myself, saying he would not detain me any longer.  I say,\npartner, I am a poor postillion, but when he gave me the crown I had a\ngood mind to fling it in his face.  I reflected, however, that it was not\nmere gift-money, but coin which I had earned, and hardly too, so I put it\nin my pocket, and I bethought me, moreover, that, knave as I knew him to\nbe, he had always treated me with civility; so I nodded to him, and he\nsaid something which, perhaps, he meant for Latin, but which sounded very\nmuch like 'vails,' and by which he doubtless alluded to the money which\nhe had given me.  He then went into the house with the rest, the coach\ndrove away which had brought the others, and I was about to get on the\nbox and follow; observing, however, two more chaises driving up, I\nthought I would be in no hurry, so I just led my horses and chaise a\nlittle out of the way, and pretending to be occupied about the harness, I\nkept a tolerably sharp look-out at the new arrivals.  Well, partner, the\nnext vehicle that drove up was a gentleman's carriage which I knew very\nwell, as well as those within it, who were a father and son, the father a\ngood kind old gentleman, and a justice of the peace, therefore not very\nwise, as you may suppose; the son a puppy who has been abroad, where he\ncontrived to forget his own language, though only nine months absent, and\nnow rules the roast over his father and mother, whose only child he is,\nand by whom he is thought wondrous clever.  So this foreigneering chap\nbrings his poor old father to this out-of-the-way house to meet these\nPlatitudes and petty-larceny villains, and perhaps would have brought his\nmother too, only, simple thing, by good fortune she happens to be laid up\nwith the rheumatic.  Well, the father and son, I beg pardon, I mean the\nson and father, got down and went in, and then after their carriage was\ngone, the chaise behind drove up, in which was a huge fat fellow,\nweighing twenty stone at least, but with something of a foreign look, and\nwith him--who do you think?  Why, a rascally Unitarian minister, that is,\na fellow who had been such a minister, but who, some years ago leaving\nhis own people, who had bred him up and sent him to their college at\nYork, went over to the High Church, and is now, I suppose, going over to\nsome other church, for he was talking, as he got down, wondrous fast in\nLatin, or what sounded something like Latin, to the fat fellow, who\nappeared to take things wonderfully easy, and merely grunted to the dog\nLatin which the scoundrel had learnt at the expense of the poor\nUnitarians at York.  So they went into the house, and presently arrived\nanother chaise, but ere I could make any further observations, the porter\nof the out-of-the-way house came up to me, asking what I was stopping\nthere for? bidding me go away, and not pry into other people's business.\n'Pretty business,' said I to him, 'that is being transacted in a place\nlike this,' and then I was going to say something uncivil, but he went to\nattend to the new comers, and I took myself away on my own business as he\nbade me, not, however, before observing that these two last were a couple\nof blackcoats.\"\n\nThe postillion then proceeded to relate how he made the best of his way\nto a small public-house, about a mile off, where he had intended to bait,\nand how he met on the way a landau and pair, belonging to a Scotch\ncoxcomb whom he had known in London, about whom he related some curious\nparticulars, and then continued: \"Well, after I had passed him and his\nturn-out, I drove straight to the public-house, where I baited my horses,\nand where I found some of the chaises and drivers who had driven the\nfolks to the lunatic-looking mansion, and were now waiting to take them\nup again.  Whilst my horses were eating their bait, I sat me down, as the\nweather was warm, at a table outside, and smoked a pipe, and drank some\nale, in company with the coachman of the old gentleman who had gone to\nthe house with his son, and the coachman then told me that the house was\na Papist house, and that the present was a grand meeting of all the fools\nand rascals in the country, who came to bow down to images, and to\nconcert schemes--pretty schemes no doubt--for overturning the religion of\nthe country, and that for his part he did not approve of being concerned\nwith such doings, and that he was going to give his master warning next\nday.  So, as we were drinking and discoursing, up drove the chariot of\nthe Scotchman, and down got his valet and the driver, and whilst the\ndriver was seeing after the horses, the valet came and sat down at the\ntable where the gentleman's coachman and I were drinking.  I knew the\nfellow well, a Scotchman like his master, and just of the same kidney,\nwith white kid gloves, red hair frizzled, a patch of paint on his face,\nand his hands covered with rings.  This very fellow, I must tell you, was\none of those most busy in endeavouring to get me turned out of the\nservants' club in Park Lane, because I happened to serve a literary man;\nso he sat down, and in a kind of affected tone cried out, 'Landlord,\nbring me a glass of cold negus.'  The landlord, however, told him that\nthere was no negus, but that if he pleased, he could have a jug of as\ngood beer as any in the country.  'Confound the beer,' said the valet,\n'do you think that I am accustomed to such vulgar beverage?'  However, as\nhe found there was nothing better to be had, he let the man bring him\nsome beer, and when he had got it, soon showed that he could drink it\neasily enough; so, when he had drunk two or three draughts, he turned his\neyes in a contemptuous manner, first, on the coachman, and then on me: I\nsaw the scamp recollected me, for after staring at me and my dress for\nabout half a minute, he put on a broad grin, and flinging his head back,\nhe uttered a loud laugh.  Well, I did not like this, as you may well\nbelieve, and taking the pipe out of my mouth, I asked him if he meant\nanything personal, to which he answered, that he had said nothing to me,\nand that he had a right to look where he pleased, and laugh when he\npleased.  Well, as to a certain extent he was right, as to looking and\nlaughing; and as I have occasionally looked at a fool and laughed, though\nI was not the fool in this instance, I put my pipe into my mouth and said\nno more.  This quiet and well-regulated behaviour of mine, however, the\nfellow interpreted into fear; so, after drinking a little more, he\nsuddenly started up, and striding once or twice before the table, he\nasked me what I meant by that impertinent question of mine, saying that\nhe had a good mind to wring my nose for my presumption.  'You have?' said\nI, getting up, and laying down my pipe.  'Well, I'll now give you an\nopportunity.'  So I put myself in an attitude, and went up to him, saying\n'I have an old score to settle with you, you scamp; you wanted to get me\nturned out of the club, didn't you?'  And thereupon, remembering that he\nhad threatened to wring my nose, I gave him a snorter upon his own.  I\nwish you could have seen the fellow when he felt the smart; so far from\ntrying to defend himself, he turned round, and with his hand to his face,\nattempted to run away; but I was now in a regular passion, and following\nhim up, got before him, and was going to pummel away at him, when he\nburst into tears, and begged me not to hurt him, saying that he was sorry\nif he had offended me, and that, if I pleased, he would go down on his\nknees, or do anything else I wanted.  Well, when I heard him talk in this\nmanner, I, of course, let him be; I could hardly help laughing at the\nfigure he cut; his face all blubbered with tears, and blood and paint;\nbut I did not laugh at the poor creature either, but went to the table\nand took up my pipe, and smoked and drank as if nothing had happened; and\nthe fellow, after having been to the pump, came and sat down, crying, and\ntrying to curry favour with me and the coachman; presently, however,\nputting on a confidential look, he began to talk of the Popish house, and\nof the doings there, and said he supposed as how we were of the party,\nand that it was all right; and then he began to talk of the Pope of Rome,\nand what a nice man he was, and what a fine thing it was to be of his\nreligion, especially if folks went over to him; and how it advanced them\nin the world, and gave them consideration; and how his master, who had\nbeen abroad and seen the Pope, and kissed his toe, was going over to the\nPopish religion, and had persuaded him to consent to do so, and to\nforsake his own, which I think the scoundrel called the 'Piscopal Church\nof Scotland, and how many others of that church were going over, thinking\nto better their condition in life by so doing, and to be more thought on;\nand how many of the English Church were thinking of going over too--and\nthat he had no doubt that it would all end right and comfortably.  Well,\nas he was going on in this way, the old coachman began to spit, and\ngetting up, flung all the beer that was in his jug upon the ground, and\ngoing away, ordered another jug of beer, and sat down at another table,\nsaying that he would not drink in such company; and I too got up, and\nflung what beer remained in my jug, there wasn't more than a drop, in the\nfellow's face, saying, I would scorn to drink any more in such company;\nand then I went to my horses, put them to, paid my reckoning, and drove\nhome.\"\n\nThe postillion having related his story, to which I listened with all due\nattention, mused for a moment, and then said, \"I dare say you remember\nhow, some time since, when old Bill had been telling us how the\nGovernment a long time ago, had done away with robbing on the highway, by\nputting down the public-houses and places which the highwaymen\nfrequented, and by sending a good mounted police to hunt them down, I\nsaid that it was a shame that the present Government did not employ\nsomewhat the same means in order to stop the proceedings of Mumbo Jumbo\nand his gang now-a-days in England.  Howsomever, since I have driven a\nfare to a Popish rendezvous, and seen something of what is going on\nthere, I should conceive that the Government are justified in allowing\nthe gang the free exercise of their calling.  Anybody is welcome to stoop\nand pick up nothing, or worse than nothing, and if Mumbo Jumbo's people,\nafter their expeditions, return to their haunts with no better plunder in\nthe shape of converts than what I saw going into yonder place of call, I\nshould say they are welcome to what they get; for if that's the kind of\nrubbish they steal out of the Church of England, or any other church, who\nin his senses but would say a good riddance, and many thanks for your\ntrouble: at any rate, that is my opinion of the matter.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nDeliberations with Self-Resolution--Invitation to Dinner--The Commercial\nTraveller--The Landlord's Offer--The Comet Wine.\n\nIt was now that I had frequent deliberations with myself.  Should I\ncontinue at the inn in my present position?  I was not very much\ncaptivated with it; there was little poetry in keeping an account of the\ncorn, hay, and straw which came in, and was given out, and I was fond of\npoetry; moreover, there was no glory at all to be expected in doing so,\nand I was fond of glory.  Should I give up that situation, and remaining\nat the inn, become ostler under old Bill?  There was more poetry in\nrubbing down horses than in keeping an account of straw, hay, and corn;\nthere was also some prospect of glory attached to the situation of\nostler, for the grooms and stable-boys occasionally talked of an ostler,\na great way down the road, who had been presented by some sporting\npeople, not with a silver vase, as our governor had been, but with a\nsilver currycomb, in testimony of their admiration for his skill; but I\nconfess that the poetry of rubbing down had become, as all other poetry\nbecomes, rather prosy by frequent repetition, and with respect to the\nchance of deriving glory from the employment, I entertained, in the event\nof my determining to stay, very slight hope of ever attaining skill in\nthe ostler art sufficient to induce sporting people to bestow upon me a\nsilver currycomb.  I was not half so good an ostler as old Bill, who had\nnever been presented with a silver currycomb, and I never expected to\nbecome so, therefore what chance had I?  It was true, there was a\nprospect of some pecuniary emolument to be derived by remaining in either\nsituation.  It was very probable that, provided I continued to keep an\naccount of the hay and corn coming in and expended, the landlord would\nconsent to allow me a pound a week, which at the end of a dozen years,\nprovided I kept myself sober, would amount to a considerable sum.  I\nmight, on the retirement of old Bill, by taking his place, save up a\ndecent sum of money, provided, unlike him, I kept myself sober, and laid\nby all the shillings and sixpences I got; but the prospect of laying up a\ndecent sum of money was not of sufficient importance to induce me to\ncontinue either at my wooden desk, or in the inn-yard.  The reader will\nremember what difficulty I had to make up my mind to become a merchant\nunder the Armenian's auspices, even with the prospect of making two or\nthree hundred thousand pounds by following the Armenian way of doing\nbusiness, so it was not probable that I should feel disposed to be a book-\nkeeper or ostler all my life with no other prospect than being able to\nmake a tidy sum of money.  If indeed, besides the prospect of making a\ntidy sum at the end of perhaps forty years' ostlering, I had been certain\nof being presented with a silver currycomb with my name engraved upon it,\nwhich I might have left to my descendants, or, in default thereof, to the\nparish church destined to contain my bones, with directions that it might\nbe soldered into the wall above the arch leading from the body of the\nchurch into the chancel--I will not say with such a certainty of\nimmortality, combined with such a prospect of moderate pecuniary\nadvantage,--I might not have thought it worth my while to stay, but I\nentertained no such certainty, and, taking everything into consideration,\nI determined to mount my horse and leave the inn.\n\nThis horse had caused me for some time past no little perplexity; I had\nfrequently repented of having purchased him, more especially as the\npurchase had been made with another person's money, and had more than\nonce shown him to people who, I imagined, were likely to purchase him;\nbut, though they were profuse in his praise, as people generally are in\nthe praise of what they don't intend to purchase, they never made me an\noffer, and now that I had determined to mount on his back and ride away,\nwhat was I to do with him in the sequel?  I could not maintain him long.\nSuddenly I bethought me of Horncastle, which Francis Ardry had mentioned\nas a place where the horse was likely to find a purchaser, and not having\ndetermined upon any particular place to which to repair, I thought that I\ncould do no better than betake myself to Horncastle in the first\ninstance, and there endeavour to dispose of my horse.\n\nOn making inquiries with respect to the situation of Horncastle, and the\ntime when the fair would be held, I learned that the town was situated in\nLincolnshire, about a hundred and fifty miles from the inn at which I was\nat present sojourning, and that the fair would be held nominally within\nabout a month, but that it was always requisite to be on the spot some\ndays before the nominal day of the fair, as all the best horses were\ngenerally sold before that time, and the people who came to purchase gone\naway with what they had bought.\n\nThe people of the inn were very sorry on being informed of my\ndetermination to depart.  Old Bill told me that he had hoped as how I had\nintended to settle down there, and to take his place as ostler when he\nwas fit for no more work, adding, that though I did not know much of the\nbusiness, yet he had no doubt but that I might improve.  My friend the\npostillion was particularly sorry, and taking me with him to the tap-room\ncalled for two pints of beer, to one of which he treated me; and whilst\nwe were drinking told me how particularly sorry he was at the thought of\nmy going, but that he hoped I should think better of the matter.  On my\ntelling him that I must go, he said that he trusted I should put off my\ndeparture for three weeks, in order that I might be present at his\nmarriage, the banns of which were just about to be published.  He said\nthat nothing would give him greater pleasure than to see me dance a\nminuet with his wife after the marriage dinner; but I told him it was\nimpossible that I should stay, my affairs imperatively calling me\nelsewhere; and that with respect to my dancing a minuet, such a thing was\nout of the question, as I had never learned to dance.  At which he said\nthat he was exceedingly sorry, and finding me determined to go, wished me\nsuccess in all my undertakings.\n\nThe master of the house, to whom, as in duty bound, I communicated my\nintention before I spoke of it to the servants, was, I make no doubt,\nvery sorry, though he did not exactly tell me so.  What he said was, that\nhe had never expected that I should remain long there, as such a\nsituation never appeared to him quite suitable to me, though I had been\nvery diligent, and had given him perfect satisfaction.  On his inquiring\nwhen I intended to depart, I informed him next day, whereupon he begged\nthat I would defer my departure till the next day but one, and do him the\nfavour of dining with him on the morrow.  I informed him that I should be\nonly too happy.\n\nOn the following day at four o'clock I dined with the landlord, in\ncompany with a commercial traveller.  The dinner was good, though plain,\nconsisting of boiled mackerel--rather a rarity in those parts at that\ntime--with fennel sauce, a prime baron of roast beef after the mackerel,\nthen a tart and noble Cheshire cheese; we had prime sherry at dinner, and\nwhilst eating the cheese prime porter, that of Barclay, the only good\nporter in the world.  After the cloth was removed we had a bottle of very\ngood port; and whilst partaking of the port I had an argument with the\ncommercial traveller on the subject of the corn-laws.\n\nThe commercial traveller, having worsted me in the argument on the\nsubject of the corn-laws, got up in great glee, saying that he must order\nhis gig, as business must be attended to.  Before leaving the room,\nhowever, he shook me patronizingly by the hand, and said something to the\nmaster of the house, but in so low a tone that it escaped my ear.\n\nNo sooner had he departed than the master of the house told me that his\nfriend the traveller had just said that I was a confounded sensible young\nfellow, and not at all opinionated, a sentiment in which he himself\nperfectly agreed--then hemming once or twice, he said that as I was going\non a journey he hoped I was tolerably well provided with money, adding\nthat travelling was rather expensive, especially on horseback, the manner\nin which he supposed, as I had a horse in the stable, I intended to\ntravel.  I told him that though I was not particularly well supplied with\nmoney, I had sufficient for the expenses of my journey, at the end of\nwhich I hoped to procure more.  He then hemmed again, and said that since\nI had been at the inn I had rendered him a great deal of service in more\nways than one, and that he should not think of permitting me to depart\nwithout making me some remuneration; then putting his hand into his\nwaistcoat pocket, he handed me a cheque for ten pounds, which he had\nprepared beforehand, the value of which he said I could receive at the\nnext town, or that, if I wished it, any waiter in the house would cash it\nfor me.  I thanked him for his generosity in the best terms I could\nselect, but, handing him back the cheque, I told him that I could not\naccept it, saying, that, so far from his being my debtor, I believed\nmyself to be indebted to him, as not only myself but my horse had been\nliving at his house for several weeks.  He replied, that as for my board\nat a house like his it amounted to nothing, and as for the little corn\nand hay which the horse had consumed it was of no consequence, and that\nhe must insist upon my taking the cheque.  But I again declined, telling\nhim that doing so would be a violation of a rule which I had determined\nto follow, and which nothing but the greatest necessity would ever compel\nme to break through--never to incur obligations.  \"But,\" said he,\n\"receiving this money will not be incurring an obligation, it is your\ndue.\"  \"I do not think so,\" said I; \"I did not engage to serve you for\nmoney, nor will I take any from you.\"  \"Perhaps you will take it as a\nloan?\" said he.  \"No,\" I replied, \"I never borrow.\"  \"Well,\" said the\nlandlord, smiling, \"you are different from all others that I am\nacquainted with.  I never yet knew any one else who scrupled to borrow\nand receive obligations; why, there are two baronets in the neighbourhood\nwho have borrowed money of me, ay, and who have never repaid what they\nborrowed; and there are a dozen squires who are under considerable\nobligations to me, who I dare say will never return them.  Come, you need\nnot be more scrupulous than your superiors--I mean in station.\"  \"Every\nvessel must stand on its own bottom,\" said I; \"they take pleasure in\nreceiving obligations, I take pleasure in being independent.  Perhaps\nthey are wise, and I am a fool, I know not, but one thing I am certain\nof, which is, that were I not independent I should be very unhappy: I\nshould have no visions then.\"  \"Have you any relations?\" said the\nlandlord, looking at me compassionately; \"excuse me, but I don't think\nyou are exactly fit to take care of yourself.\"  \"There you are mistaken,\"\nsaid I, \"I can take precious good care of myself; ay, and can drive a\nprecious hard bargain when I have occasion, but driving bargains is a\nwidely different thing from receiving gifts.  I am going to take my horse\nto Horncastle, and when there I shall endeavour to obtain his full\nvalue--ay to the last penny.\"\n\n\"Horncastle!\" said the landlord, \"I have heard of that place; you mustn't\nbe dreaming visions when you get there, or they'll steal the horse from\nunder you.  Well,\" said he, rising, \"I shall not press you further on the\nsubject of the cheque.  I intend, however, to put you under an obligation\nto me.\"  He then rang the bell, and having ordered two fresh glasses to\nbe brought, he went out and presently returned with a small pint bottle,\nwhich he uncorked with his own hand; then sitting down, he said, \"The\nwine that I bring here, is port of eighteen hundred and eleven, the year\nof the comet, the best vintage on record; the wine which we have been\ndrinking,\" he added, \"is good, but not to be compared with this, which I\nnever sell, and which I am chary of.  When you have drunk some of it, I\nthink you will own that I have conferred an obligation upon you;\" he then\nfilled the glasses, the wine which he poured out diffusing an aroma\nthrough the room; then motioning me to drink, he raised his own glass to\nhis lips, saying, \"Come, friend, I drink to your success at Horncastle.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nTriumphal Departure--No Season like Youth--Extreme Old Age--Beautiful\nEngland--The Ratcatcher--A Misadventure.\n\nI departed from the inn much in the same fashion as I had come to it,\nmounted on a splendid horse indifferently well caparisoned, with the\nsmall valise attached to my crupper, in which, besides the few things I\nhad brought with me, was a small book of roads with a map which had been\npresented to me by the landlord.  I must not forget to state that I did\nnot ride out of the yard, but that my horse was brought to me at the\nfront door by old Bill, who insisted upon doing so, and who refused a\nfive-shilling piece which I offered him; and it will be as well to let\nthe reader know that the landlord shook me by the hand as I mounted, and\nthat the people attached to the inn, male and female--my friend the\npostillion at the head--assembled before the house to see me off, and\ngave me three cheers as I rode away.  Perhaps no person ever departed\nfrom an inn with more eclat or better wishes; nobody looked at me\naskance, except two stage-coachmen who were loitering about, one of whom\nsaid to his companion, \"I say, Jim! twig his portmanteau! a regular\nNewmarket turn-out, by--!\"\n\nIt was in the cool of the evening of a bright day--all the days of that\nsummer were bright--that I departed.  I felt at first rather melancholy\nat finding myself again launched into the wide world, and leaving the\nfriends whom I had lately made behind me; but by occasionally trotting\nthe horse, and occasionally singing a song of Romanvile, I had dispelled\nthe feeling of melancholy by the time I had proceeded three miles down\nthe main road.  It was at the end of these three miles, just opposite a\nmilestone, that I struck into a cross road.  After riding about seven\nmiles, threading what are called, in postillion parlance, cross-country\nroads, I reached another high road, tending to the east, along which I\nproceeded for a mile or two, when coming to a small inn, about nine\no'clock, I halted and put up for the night.\n\nEarly on the following morning I proceeded on my journey, but fearing to\ngall the horse, I no longer rode him, but led him by the bridle, until I\ncame to a town at the distance of about ten miles from the place where I\nhad passed the night.  Here I stayed during the heat of the day, more on\nthe horse's account than my own, and towards evening resumed my journey,\nleading the animal by the bridle as before; and in this manner I\nproceeded for several days, travelling on an average from twenty to\ntwenty-five miles a day, always leading the animal, except perhaps now\nand then of an evening, when, if I saw a good piece of road before me, I\nwould mount and put the horse into a trot, which the creature seemed to\nenjoy as much as myself, showing his satisfaction by snorting and\nneighing, whilst I gave utterance to my own exhilaration by shouts, or by\n\"the chi she is kaulo she soves pre lakie dumo,\" or by something else of\nthe same kind in Romanvile.\n\nOn the whole, I journeyed along very pleasantly, certainly quite as\npleasantly as I do at present, now that I am become a gentleman and weigh\nsixteen stone, though some people would say that my present manner of\ntravelling is much the most preferable, riding as I now do, instead of\nleading my horse; receiving the homage of ostlers instead of their\nfamiliar nods; sitting down to dinner in the parlour of the best inn I\ncan find, instead of passing the brightest part of the day in the kitchen\nof a village alehouse; carrying on my argument after dinner on the\nsubject of the corn-laws, with the best commercial gentlemen on the road,\ninstead of being glad, whilst sipping a pint of beer, to get into\nconversation with blind trampers, or maimed Abraham sailors, regaling\nthemselves on half-pints at the said village hostelries.  Many people\nwill doubtless say that things have altered wonderfully with me for the\nbetter, and they would say right, provided I possessed now what I then\ncarried about with me in my journeys--the spirit of youth.  Youth is the\nonly season for enjoyment, and the first twenty-five years of one's life\nare worth all the rest of the longest life of man, even though those five-\nand-twenty be spent in penury and contempt, and the rest in the\npossession of wealth, honours, respectability, ay, and many of them in\nstrength and health, such as will enable one to ride forty miles before\ndinner, and over one's pint of port--for the best gentleman in the land\nshould not drink a bottle--carry on one's argument, with gravity and\ndecorum, with any commercial gentleman who, responsive to one's\nchallenge, takes the part of humanity and common sense against\n\"protection\" and the lord of the land.\n\nAh! there is nothing like youth--not that after-life is valueless.  Even\nin extreme old age one may get on very well, provided we will but accept\nof the bounties of God.  I met the other day an old man, who asked me to\ndrink.  \"I am not thirsty,\" said I, \"and will not drink with you.\"  \"Yes,\nyou will,\" said the old man, \"for I am this day one hundred years old;\nand you will never again have an opportunity of drinking the health of a\nman on his hundredth birthday.\"  So I broke my word, and drank.  \"Yours\nis a wonderful age,\" said I.  \"It is a long time to look back to the\nbeginning of it,\" said the old man; \"yet, upon the whole, I am not sorry\nto have lived it all.\"  \"How have you passed your time?\" said I.  \"As\nwell as I could,\" said the old man; \"always enjoying a good thing when it\ncame honestly within my reach; not forgetting to praise God for putting\nit there.\"  \"I suppose you were fond of a glass of good ale when you were\nyoung?\"  \"Yes,\" said the old man, \"I was; and so, thank God, I am still.\"\nAnd he drank off a glass of ale.\n\nOn I went in my journey, traversing England from west to east--ascending\nand descending hills--crossing rivers by bridge and ferry--and passing\nover extensive plains.  What a beautiful country is England!  People run\nabroad to see beautiful countries, and leave their own behind unknown,\nunnoticed--their own the most beautiful!  And then, again, what a country\nfor adventures! especially to those who travel on foot, or on horseback.\nPeople run abroad in quest of adventures, and traverse Spain or Portugal\non mule or on horseback; whereas there are ten times more adventures to\nbe met with in England than in Spain, Portugal, or stupid Germany to\nboot.  Witness the number of adventures narrated in the present book--a\nbook entirely devoted to England.  Why, there is not a chapter in the\npresent book which is not full of adventures, with the exception of the\npresent one, and this is not yet terminated.\n\nAfter traversing two or three counties, I reached the confines of\nLincolnshire.  During one particularly hot day I put up at a\npublic-house, to which, in the evening, came a party of harvesters to\nmake merry, who, finding me wandering about the house a stranger, invited\nme to partake of their ale; so I drank with the harvesters, who sang me\nsongs about rural life, such as--\n\n   \"Sitting in the swale; and listening to the swindle of the flail, as\n   it sounds dub-a-dub on the corn, from the neighbouring barn.\"\n\nIn requital for which I treated them with a song, not of Romanvile, but\nthe song of \"Sivory and the horse Grayman.\"  I remained with them till it\nwas dark, having, after sunset, entered into deep discourse with a\ncelebrated ratcatcher, who communicated to me the secrets of his trade,\nsaying, amongst other things, \"When you see the rats pouring out of their\nholes, and running up my hands and arms, it's not after me they comes,\nbut after the oils I carries about me they comes;\" and who subsequently\nspoke in the most enthusiastic manner of his trade, saying that it was\nthe best trade in the world, and most diverting, and that it was likely\nto last for ever; for whereas all other kinds of vermin were fast\ndisappearing from England, rats were every day becoming more abundant.  I\nhad quitted this good company, and having mounted my horse, was making my\nway towards a town at about six miles' distance, at a swinging trot, my\nthoughts deeply engaged on what I had gathered from the ratcatcher, when\nall on a sudden a light glared upon the horse's face, who purled round in\ngreat terror, and flung me out of the saddle, as from a sling, or with as\nmuch violence as the horse Grayman, in the ballad, flings Sivord the\nSnareswayne.  I fell upon the ground--felt a kind of crashing about my\nneck--and forthwith became senseless.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\nA Novel Situation--The Elderly Individual--The Surgeon--A Kind\nOffer--Chimerical Ideas--Strange Dream.\n\nHow long I remained senseless I cannot say, for a considerable time, I\nbelieve; at length, opening my eyes, I found myself lying on a bed in a\nmiddle-sized chamber, lighted by a candle, which stood on a table--an\nelderly man stood near me, and a yet more elderly female was holding a\nphial of very pungent salts to my olfactory organ.  I attempted to move,\nbut felt very stiff--my right arm appeared nearly paralysed, and there\nwas a strange dull sensation in my head.  \"You had better remain still,\nyoung man,\" said the elderly individual, \"the surgeon will be here\npresently; I have sent a message for him to the neighbouring village.\"\n\"Where am I?\" said I, \"and what has happened?\"  \"You are in my house,\"\nsaid the old man, \"and you have been flung from a horse.  I am sorry to\nsay that I was the cause.  As I was driving home, the lights in my gig\nfrightened the animal.\"  \"Where is the horse?\" said I.  \"Below, in my\nstable,\" said the elderly individual.  \"I saw you fall, but knowing that\non account of my age I could be of little use to you, I instantly hurried\nhome, the accident did not occur more than a furlong off, and procuring\nthe assistance of my lad, and two or three neighbouring cottagers, I\nreturned to the spot where you were lying senseless.  We raised you up,\nand brought you here.  My lad then went in quest of the horse, who had\nrun away as we drew nigh.  When we saw him first he was standing near\nyou; he caught him with some difficulty, and brought him home.  What are\nyou about?\" said the old man, as I strove to get off the bed.  \"I want to\nsee the horse,\" said I.  \"I entreat you to be still,\" said the old man;\n\"the horse is safe, I assure you.\"  \"I am thinking about his knees,\" said\nI.  \"Instead of thinking about your horse's knees,\" said the old man, \"be\nthankful that you have not broke your own neck.\"  \"You do not talk\nwisely,\" said I; \"when a man's neck is broke, he is provided for; but\nwhen his horse's knees are broke, he is a lost jockey, that is, if he has\nnothing but his horse to depend upon.  A pretty figure I should cut at\nHorncastle, mounted on a horse blood-raw at the knees.\"  \"Oh, you are\ngoing to Horncastle,\" said the old man, seriously, \"then I can sympathize\nwith you in your anxiety about your horse, being a Lincolnshire man, and\nthe son of one who bred horses.  I will myself go down into the stable,\nand examine into the condition of your horse, so pray remain quiet till I\nreturn; it would certainly be a terrible thing to appear at Horncastle on\na broken-kneed horse.\"\n\nHe left the room and returned in about ten minutes, followed by another\nperson.  \"Your horse is safe,\" said he, \"and his knees are unblemished;\nnot a hair ruffled.  He is a fine animal, and will do credit to\nHorncastle; but here is the surgeon come to examine into your own\ncondition.\"  The surgeon was a man about thirty-five, thin, and rather\ntall; his face was long and pale, and his hair, which was light, was\ncarefully combed back as much as possible from his forehead.  He was\ndressed very neatly, and spoke in a very precise tone.  \"Allow me to feel\nyour pulse, friend?\" said he, taking me by the right wrist.  I uttered a\ncry, for at the motion which he caused a thrill of agony darted through\nmy arm.  \"I hope your arm is not broke, my friend,\" said the surgeon,\n\"allow me to see; first of all, we must divest you of this cumbrous\nfrock.\"\n\nThe frock was removed with some difficulty, and then the upper vestments\nof my frame, with more difficulty still.  The surgeon felt my arm, moving\nit up and down, causing me unspeakable pain.  \"There is no fracture,\"\nsaid he, at last, \"but a contusion--a violent contusion.  I am told you\nwere going to Horncastle; I am afraid you will be hardly able to ride\nyour horse thither in time to dispose of him; however, we shall see--your\narm must be bandaged, friend; after which I shall bleed you, and\nadminister a composing draught.\"\n\nTo be short, the surgeon did as he proposed, and when he had administered\nthe composing draught, he said, \"Be of good cheer; I should not be\nsurprised if you are yet in time for Horncastle.\"  He then departed with\nthe master of the house, and the woman, leaving me to my repose.  I soon\nbegan to feel drowsy, and was just composing myself to slumber, lying on\nmy back, as the surgeon had advised me, when I heard steps ascending the\nstairs, and in a moment more the surgeon entered again, followed by the\nmaster of the house.  \"I hope I don't disturb you,\" said the former; \"my\nreason for returning is to relieve your mind from any anxiety with\nrespect to your horse.  I am by no means sure that you will be able,\nowing to your accident, to reach Horncastle in time: to quiet you,\nhowever, I will buy your horse for any reasonable sum.  I have been down\nto the stable, and approve of his figure.  What do you ask for him?\"\n\"This is a strange time of night,\" said I, \"to come to me about\npurchasing my horse, and I am hardly in a fitting situation to be applied\nto about such a matter.  What do you want him for?\"  \"For my own use,\"\nsaid the surgeon; \"I am a professional man, and am obliged to be\ncontinually driving about; I cover at least one hundred and fifty miles\nevery week.\"  \"He will never answer your purpose,\" said I, \"he is not a\ndriving horse, and was never between shafts in his life; he is for\nriding, more especially for trotting, at which he has few equals.\"  \"It\nmatters not to me whether he is for riding or driving,\" said the surgeon,\n\"sometimes I ride, sometimes drive; so, if we can come to terms, I will\nbuy him, though remember it is chiefly to remove any anxiety from your\nmind about him.\"  \"This is no time for bargaining,\" said I, \"if you wish\nto have the horse for a hundred guineas, you may; if not--\"  \"A hundred\nguineas!\" said the surgeon, \"my good friend, you must surely be light-\nheaded; allow me to feel your pulse,\" and he attempted to feel my left\nwrist.  \"I am not light-headed,\" said I, \"and I require no one to feel my\npulse; but I should be light-headed if I were to sell my horse for less\nthan I have demanded; but I have a curiosity to know what you would be\nwilling to offer.\"  \"Thirty pounds,\" said the surgeon, \"is all I can\nafford to give; and that is a great deal for a country surgeon to offer\nfor a horse.\"  \"Thirty pounds!\" said I, \"why, he cost me nearly double\nthat sum.  To tell you the truth, I am afraid that you want to take\nadvantage of my situation.\"  \"Not in the least, friend,\" said the\nsurgeon, \"not in the least; I only wished to set your mind at rest about\nyour horse; but as you think he is worth more than I can afford to offer,\ntake him to Horncastle by all means; I will do my best to cure you in\ntime.  Good night, I will see you again on the morrow.\"  Thereupon he\nonce more departed with the master of the house.  \"A sharp one,\" I heard\nhim say, with a laugh, as the door closed upon him.\n\nLeft to myself, I again essayed to compose myself to rest, but for some\ntime in vain.  I had been terribly shaken by my fall, and had\nsubsequently, owing to the incision of the surgeon's lancet, been\ndeprived of much of the vital fluid; it is when the body is in such a\nstate that the merest trifles affect and agitate the mind; no wonder,\nthen, that the return of the surgeon and the master of the house for the\npurpose of inquiring whether I would sell my horse, struck me as being\nhighly extraordinary, considering the hour of the night, and the\nsituation in which they knew me to be.  What could they mean by such\nconduct--did they wish to cheat me of the animal?  \"Well, well,\" said I,\n\"if they did, what matters, they found their match; yes, yes,\" said I,\n\"but I am in their power, perhaps\"--but I instantly dismissed the\napprehension which came into my mind, with a pooh, nonsense!  In a little\ntime, however, a far more foolish and chimerical idea began to disturb\nme--the idea of being flung from my horse; was I not disgraced for ever\nas a horseman by being flung from my horse?  Assuredly, I thought; and\nthe idea of being disgraced as a horseman, operating on my nervous\nsystem, caused me very acute misery.  \"After all,\" said I to myself, \"it\nwas perhaps the contemptible opinion which the surgeon must have formed\nof my equestrian powers, which induced him to offer to take my horse off\nmy hands; he perhaps thought I was unable to manage a horse, and\ntherefore in pity returned in the dead of night to offer to purchase the\nanimal which had flung me;\" and then the thought that the surgeon had\nconceived a contemptible opinion of my equestrian powers, caused me the\nacutest misery, and continued tormenting me until some other idea (I have\nforgot what it was, but doubtless equally foolish) took possession of my\nmind.  At length, brought on by the agitation of my spirits, there came\nover me the same feeling of horror that I had experienced of old when I\nwas a boy, and likewise of late within the dingle; it was, however, not\nso violent as it had been on those occasions, and I struggled manfully\nagainst it, until by degrees it passed away, and then I fell asleep; and\nin my sleep I had an ugly dream.  I dreamt that I had died of the\ninjuries I had received from my fall, and that no sooner had my soul\ndeparted from my body than it entered that of a quadruped, even my own\nhorse in the stable--in a word, I was, to all intents and purposes, my\nown steed; and as I stood in the stable chewing hay (and I remember that\nthe hay was exceedingly tough), the door opened, and the surgeon who had\nattended me came in.  \"My good animal,\" said he, \"as your late master has\nscarcely left enough to pay for the expenses of his funeral, and nothing\nto remunerate me for my trouble, I shall make bold to take possession of\nyou.  If your paces are good, I shall keep you for my own riding; if not,\nI shall take you to Horncastle, your original destination.\"  He then\nbridled and saddled me, and, leading me out, mounted, and then trotted me\nup and down before the house, at the door of which the old man, who now\nappeared to be dressed in regular jockey fashion, was standing.  \"I like\nhis paces well,\" said the surgeon; \"I think I shall take him for my own\nuse.\"  \"And what am I to have for all the trouble his master caused me?\"\nsaid my late entertainer, on whose countenance I now observed, for the\nfirst time, a diabolical squint.  \"The consciousness of having done your\nduty to a fellow-creature in succouring him in a time of distress, must\nbe your reward,\" said the surgeon.  \"Pretty gammon, truly,\" said my late\nentertainer; \"what would you say if I were to talk in that way to you?\nCome, unless you choose to behave jonnock, I shall take the bridle and\nlead the horse back into the stable.\"  \"Well,\" said the surgeon, \"we are\nold friends, and I don't wish to dispute with you, so I'll tell you what\nI will do; I will ride the animal to Horncastle, and we will share what\nhe fetches like brothers.\"  \"Good,\" said the old man, \"but if you say\nthat you have sold him for less than a hundred, I shan't consider you\njonnock; remember what the young fellow said--that young fellow--\"  I\nheard no more, for the next moment I found myself on a broad road\nleading, as I supposed, in the direction of Horncastle, the surgeon still\nin the saddle, and my legs moving at a rapid trot.  \"Get on,\" said the\nsurgeon, jerking my mouth with the bit; whereupon, full of rage, I\ninstantly set off at a full gallop, determined, if possible, to dash my\nrider to the earth.  The surgeon, however, kept his seat, and, so far\nfrom attempting to abate my speed, urged me on to greater efforts with a\nstout stick, which methought he held in his hand.  In vain did I rear and\nkick, attempting to get rid of my foe; but the surgeon remained as saddle-\nfast as ever the Maugrabin sorcerer in the Arabian tale what time he rode\nthe young prince transformed into a steed to his enchanted palace in the\nwilderness.  At last, as I was still madly dashing on, panting and\nblowing, and had almost given up all hope, I saw at a distance before me\na heap of stones by the side of the road, probably placed there for the\npurpose of repairing it; a thought appeared to strike me--I will shy at\nthose stones, and, if I can't get rid of him so, resign myself to my\nfate.  So I increased my speed, till arriving within about ten yards of\nthe heap, I made a desperate start, turning half round with nearly the\nvelocity of a mill-stone.  Oh, the joy I experienced when I felt my enemy\ncanted over my neck, and saw him lying senseless in the road.  \"I have\nyou now in my power,\" I said, or rather neighed, as, going up to my\nprostrate foe, I stood over him.  \"Suppose I were to rear now, and let my\nfore feet fall upon you, what would your life be worth? that is,\nsupposing you are not killed already; but lie there, I will do you no\nfurther harm, but trot to Horncastle without a rider, and when there--\"\nand without further reflection off I trotted in the direction of\nHorncastle, but had not gone far before my bridle, falling from my neck,\ngot entangled with my off fore foot.  I felt myself falling, a thrill of\nagony shot through me--my knees would be broken, and what should I do at\nHorncastle with a pair of broken knees?  I struggled, but I could not\ndisengage my off fore foot, and downward I fell, but before I had reached\nthe ground I awoke, and found myself half out of bed, my bandaged arm in\nconsiderable pain, and my left hand just touching the floor.\n\nWith some difficulty I readjusted myself in bed.  It was now early\nmorning, and the first rays of the sun were beginning to penetrate the\nwhite curtains of a window on my left, which probably looked into the\ngarden, as I caught a glimpse or two of the leaves of trees through a\nsmall uncovered part at the side.  For some time I felt uneasy and\nanxious, my spirits being in a strange fluttering state.  At last my eyes\nfell upon a small row of tea-cups seemingly of china, which stood on a\nmantelpiece exactly fronting the bottom of the bed.  The sight of these\nobjects, I know not why, soothed and pacified me; I kept my eyes fixed\nupon them, as I lay on my back on the bed, with my head upon the pillow,\ntill at last I fell into a calm and refreshing sleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nThe Morning after a Fall--The Teapot--Unpretending Hospitality--The\nChinese Student.\n\nIt might be about eight o'clock in the morning when I was awakened by the\nentrance of the old man.  \"How have you rested?\" said he, coming up to\nthe bedside, and looking me in the face.  \"Well,\" said I, \"and I feel\nmuch better, but I am still very sore.\"  I surveyed him now for the first\ntime with attention.  He was dressed in a sober-coloured suit, and was\napparently between sixty and seventy.  In stature he was rather above the\nmiddle height, but with a slight stoop; his features were placid, and\nexpressive of much benevolence, but, as it appeared to me, with rather a\nmelancholy cast--as I gazed upon them, I felt ashamed that I should ever\nhave conceived in my brain a vision like that of the preceding night, in\nwhich he appeared in so disadvantageous a light.  At length he said, \"It\nis now time for you to take some refreshment.  I hear my old servant\ncoming up with your breakfast.\"  In a moment the elderly female entered\nwith a tray, on which was some bread and butter, a teapot and cup.  The\ncup was of common blue earthenware, but the pot was of china, curiously\nfashioned, and seemingly of great antiquity.  The old man poured me out a\ncupful of tea, and then, with the assistance of the woman, raised me\nhigher, and propped me up with the pillows.  I ate and drank; when the\npot was emptied of its liquid (it did not contain much), I raised it up\nwith my left hand to inspect it.  The sides were covered with curious\ncharacters, seemingly hieroglyphics.  After surveying them for some time,\nI replaced it upon the tray.  \"You seem fond of china,\" said I, to the\nold man, after the servant had retired with the breakfast things, and I\nhad returned to my former posture; \"you have china on the mantelpiece,\nand that was a remarkable teapot out of which I have just been drinking.\"\n\nThe old man fixed his eyes intently on me, and methought the expression\nof his countenance became yet more melancholy.  \"Yes,\" said he, at last,\n\"I am fond of china--I have reason to be fond of china--but for china I\nshould--\" and here he sighed again.\n\n\"You value it for the quaintness and singularity of its form,\" said I;\n\"it appears to be less adapted for real use than our own pottery.\"\n\n\"I care little about its form,\" said the old man; \"I care for it simply\non account of--however, why talk to you on the subject which can have no\npossible interest to you?  I expect the surgeon here presently.\"\n\n\"I do not like that surgeon at all,\" said I; \"how strangely he behaved\nlast night, coming back, when I was just falling asleep, to ask me if I\nwould sell my horse.\"\n\nThe old man smiled.  \"He has but one failing,\" said he, \"an itch for\nhorse-dealing; but for that he might be a much richer man than he is; he\nis continually buying and exchanging horses, and generally finds himself\na loser by his bargains: but he is a worthy creature, and skilful in his\nprofession--it is well for you that you are under his care.\"\n\nThe old man then left me, and in about an hour returned with the surgeon,\nwho examined me and reported favourably as to my case.  He spoke to me\nwith kindness and feeling, and did not introduce the subject of the\nhorse.  I asked him whether he thought I should be in time for the fair.\n\"I saw some people making their way thither to-day,\" said he; \"the fair\nlasts three weeks, and it has just commenced.  Yes, I think I may promise\nyou that you will be in time for the very heat of it.  In a few days you\nwill be able to mount your saddle with your arm in a sling, but you must\nby no means appear with your arm in a sling at Horncastle, as people\nwould think that your horse had flung you, and that you wanted to dispose\nof him because he was a vicious brute.  You must, by all means, drop the\nsling before you get to Horncastle.\"\n\nFor three days I kept my apartment by the advice of the surgeon.  I\npassed my time as I best could.  Stretched on my bed, I either abandoned\nmyself to reflection, or listened to the voices of the birds in the\nneighbouring garden.  Sometimes, as I lay awake at night, I would\nendeavour to catch the tick of a clock, which methought sounded from some\ndistant part of the house.\n\nThe old man visited me twice or thrice every day to inquire into my\nstate.  His words were few on these occasions, and he did not stay long.\nYet his voice and his words were kind.  What surprised me most in\nconnection with this individual was, the delicacy of conduct which he\nexhibited in not letting a word proceed from his lips which could testify\ncuriosity respecting who I was, or whence I came.  All he knew of me was,\nthat I had been flung from my horse on my way to a fair for the purpose\nof disposing of the animal; and that I was now his guest.  I might be a\ncommon horse-dealer for what he knew, yet I was treated by him with all\nthe attention which I could have expected, had I been an alderman of\nBoston's heir, and known to him as such.  The county in which I am now,\nthought I at last, must be either extraordinarily devoted to hospitality,\nor this old host of mine must be an extraordinary individual.  On the\nevening of the fourth day, feeling tired of my confinement, I put my\nclothes on in the best manner I could, and left the chamber.  Descending\na flight of stairs, I reached a kind of quadrangle, from which branched\ntwo or three passages; one of these I entered, which had a door at the\nfarther end, and one on each side; the one to the left standing partly\nopen, I entered it, and found myself in a middle-sized room with a large\nwindow, or rather glass-door, which looked into a garden, and which stood\nopen.  There was nothing remarkable in this room, except a large quantity\nof china.  There was china on the mantelpiece--china on two tables, and a\nsmall beaufet, which stood opposite the glass-door, was covered with\nchina--there were cups, teapots, and vases of various forms, and on all\nof them I observed characters--not a teapot, not a tea-cup, not a vase of\nwhatever form or size, but appeared to possess hieroglyphics on some part\nor other.  After surveying these articles for some time with no little\ninterest, I passed into the garden, in which there were small parterres\nof flowers, and two or three trees, and which, where the house did not\nabut, was bounded by a wall; turning to the right by a walk by the side\nof a house, I passed by a door--probably the one I had seen at the end of\nthe passage--and arrived at another window similar to that through which\nI had come, and which also stood open; I was about to pass through it,\nwhen I heard the voice of my entertainer exclaiming, \"Is that you? pray\ncome in.\"\n\nI entered the room, which seemed to be a counterpart of the one which I\nhad just left.  It was of the same size, had the same kind of furniture,\nand appeared to be equally well stocked with china; one prominent article\nit possessed, however, which the other room did not exhibit--namely, a\nclock, which, with its pendulum moving tick-a-tick, hung against the wall\nopposite to the door, the sight of which made me conclude that the sound\nwhich methought I had heard in the stillness of the night was not an\nimaginary one.  There it hung on the wall, with its pendulum moving tick-\na-tick.  The old gentleman was seated in an easy chair a little way into\nthe room, having the glass-door on his right hand.  On a table before him\nlay a large open volume, in which I observed Roman letters as well as\ncharacters.  A few inches beyond the book on the table, covered all over\nwith hieroglyphics, stood a china vase.  The eyes of the old man were\nfixed upon it.\n\n\"Sit down,\" said he, motioning me with his hand to a stool close by, but\nwithout taking his eyes from the vase.\n\n\"I can't make it out,\" said he, at last, removing his eyes from the vase,\nand leaning back on the chair, \"I can't make it out.\"\n\n\"I wish I could assist you,\" said I.\n\n\"Assist me,\" said the old man, looking at me with a half smile.\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"but I don't understand Chinese.\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" said the old man, with another slight smile; \"but--but--\"\n\n\"Pray proceed,\" said I.\n\n\"I wished to ask you,\" said the old man, \"how you knew that the\ncharacters on yon piece of crockery were Chinese; or, indeed, that there\nwas such a language?\"\n\n\"I knew the crockery was china,\" said I, \"and naturally enough supposed\nwhat was written upon it to be Chinese; as for there being such a\nlanguage--the English have a language, the French have a language, and\nwhy not the Chinese?\"\n\n\"May I ask you a question?\"\n\n\"As many as you like.\"\n\n\"Do you know any language besides English?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"I know a little of two or three.\"\n\n\"May I ask their names?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said I, \"I know a little French.\"\n\n\"Anything else?\"\n\n\"Yes, a little Welsh, and a little Haik.\"\n\n\"What is Haik?\"\n\n\"Armenian.\"\n\n\"I am glad to see you in my house,\" said the old man, shaking me by the\nhand; \"how singular that one coming as you did should know Armenian!\"\n\n\"Not more singular,\" said I, \"than that one living in such a place as\nthis should know Chinese.  How came you to acquire it?\"\n\nThe old man looked at me, and sighed.  \"I beg pardon,\" said I, \"for\nasking what is, perhaps, an impertinent question; I have not imitated\nyour own delicacy; you have never asked me a question without first\ndesiring permission, and here I have been days and nights in your house\nan intruder on your hospitality, and you have never so much as asked me\nwho I am.\"\n\n\"In forbearing to do that,\" said the old man, \"I merely obeyed the\nChinese precept, 'Ask no questions of a guest;' it is written on both\nsides of the teapot out of which you have had your tea.\"\n\n\"I wish I knew Chinese,\" said I.  \"Is it a difficult language to\nacquire?\"\n\n\"I have reason to think so,\" said the old man.  \"I have been occupied\nupon it five-and-thirty years, and I am still very imperfectly acquainted\nwith it; at least, I frequently find upon my crockery sentences the\nmeaning of which to me is very dark, though it is true these sentences\nare mostly verses, which are, of course, more difficult to understand\nthan mere prose.\"\n\n\"Are your Chinese studies,\" said I, \"confined to crockery literature?\"\n\n\"Entirely,\" said the old man; \"I read nothing else.\"\n\n\"I have heard,\" said I, \"that the Chinese have no letters, but that for\nevery word they have a separate character--is it so?\"\n\n\"For every word they have a particular character,\" said the old man;\n\"though, to prevent confusion, they have arranged their words under two\nhundred and fourteen what we should call radicals, but which they call\nkeys.  As we arrange all our words in a dictionary under twenty-four\nletters, so do they arrange all their words, or characters, under two\nhundred and fourteen radical signs; the simplest radicals being the\nfirst, and the more complex the last.\"\n\n\"Does the Chinese resemble any of the European languages in words?\" said\nI.\n\n\"I am scarcely competent to inform you,\" said the old man; \"but I believe\nnot.\"\n\n\"What does that character represent?\" said I, pointing to one on the\nvase.\n\n\"A knife,\" said the old man, \"that character is one of the simplest\nradicals or keys.\"\n\n\"And what is the sound of it?\" said I.\n\n\"Tau,\" said the old man.\n\n\"Tau!\" said I; \"tau!\"\n\n\"A strange word for a knife is it not?\" said the old man.\n\n\"Tawse!\" said I; \"tawse!\"\n\n\"What is tawse?\" said the old man.\n\n\"You were never at school at Edinburgh, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Never,\" said the old man.\n\n\"That accounts for your not knowing the meaning of tawse,\" said I; \"had\nyou received the rudiments of a classical education at the High School,\nyou would have known the meaning of tawse full well.  It is a leathern\nthong, with which refractory urchins are recalled to a sense of their\nduty by the dominie.  Tau--tawse--how singular!\"\n\n\"I cannot see what the two words have in common, except a slight\nagreement in sound.\"\n\n\"You will see the connection,\" said I, \"when I inform you that the thong,\nfrom the middle to the bottom, is cut or slit into two or three parts,\nfrom which slits or cuts, unless I am very much mistaken, it derives its\nname--tawse, a thong with slits or cuts, used for chastising disorderly\nurchins at the High School, from the French tailler, to cut; evidently\nconnected with the Chinese tau, a knife--how very extraordinary!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nConvalescence--The Surgeon's Bill--Letter of Recommendation--Commencement\nof the Old Man's History.\n\nTwo days--three days passed away--and I still remained at the house of my\nhospitable entertainer; my bruised limb rapidly recovering the power of\nperforming its functions.  I passed my time agreeably enough, sometimes\nin my chamber, communing with my own thoughts; sometimes in the stable,\nattending to, and not unfrequently conversing with, my horse; and at meal-\ntime--for I seldom saw him at any other--discoursing with the old\ngentleman, sometimes on the Chinese vocabulary, sometimes on Chinese\nsyntax, and once or twice on English horseflesh; though on this latter\nsubject, notwithstanding his descent from a race of horse-traders, he did\nnot enter into with much alacrity.  As a small requital for his kindness,\nI gave him one day, after dinner, unasked, a brief account of my history\nand pursuits.  He listened with attention; and when it was concluded,\nthanked me for the confidence which I had reposed in him.  \"Such\nconduct,\" said he, \"deserves a return.  I will tell you my own history;\nit is brief, but may perhaps not prove uninteresting to you--though the\nrelation of it will give me some pain.\"  \"Pray, then, do not recite it,\"\nsaid I.  \"Yes,\" said the old man, \"I will tell you, for I wish you to\nknow it.\"  He was about to begin, when he was interrupted by the arrival\nof the surgeon.  The surgeon examined into the state of my bruised limb,\nand told me, what indeed I already well knew, that it was rapidly\nimproving.  \"You will not even require a sling,\" said he, \"to ride to\nHorncastle.  When do you propose going?\" he demanded.  \"When do you think\nI may venture?\" I replied.  \"I think, if you are a tolerably good\nhorseman, you may mount the day after to-morrow,\" answered the medical\nman.  \"By-the-bye, are you acquainted with anybody at Horncastle?\" \"With\nno living soul,\" I answered.  \"Then you would scarcely find stable-room\nfor your horse.  But I am happy to be able to assist you.  I have a\nfriend there who keeps a small inn, and who, during the time of the fair,\nkeeps a stall vacant for any quadruped I may bring, until he knows\nwhether I am coming or not.  I will give you a letter to him, and he will\nsee after the accommodation of your horse.  To-morrow I will pay you a\nfarewell visit, and bring you the letter.\"  \"Thank you,\" said I; \"and do\nnot forget to bring your bill.\"  The surgeon looked at the old man, who\ngave him a peculiar nod.  \"Oh!\" said he, in reply to me, \"for the little\nservice I have rendered you, I require no remuneration.  You are in my\nfriend's house, and he and I understand each other.\"  \"I never receive\nsuch favours,\" said I, \"as you have rendered me, without remunerating\nthem; therefore I shall expect your bill.\"  \"Oh! just as you please,\"\nsaid the surgeon; and shaking me by the hand more warmly than he had\nhitherto done, he took his leave.\n\nOn the evening of the next day, the last which I spent with my kind\nentertainer, I sat at tea with him in a little summer-house in his\ngarden, partially shaded by the boughs of a large fig-tree.  The surgeon\nhad shortly before paid me his farewell visit, and had brought me the\nletter of introduction to his friend at Horncastle, and also his bill,\nwhich I found anything but extravagant.  After we had each respectively\ndrank the contents of two cups--and it may not be amiss here to inform\nthe reader that though I took cream with my tea, as I always do when I\ncan procure that addition, the old man, like most people bred up in the\ncountry, drank his without it--he thus addressed me:--\"I am, as I told\nyou on the night of your accident, the son of a breeder of horses, a\nrespectable and honest man.  When I was about twenty he died, leaving me,\nhis only child, a comfortable property, consisting of about two hundred\nacres of land and some fifteen hundred pounds in money.  My mother had\ndied about three years previously.  I felt the death of my mother keenly,\nbut that of my father less than was my duty; indeed, truth compels me to\nacknowledge that I scarcely regretted his death.  The cause of this want\nof proper filial feeling was the opposition which I had experienced from\nhim in an affair which deeply concerned me.  I had formed an attachment\nfor a young female in the neighbourhood, who, though poor, was of highly\nrespectable birth, her father having been a curate of the Established\nChurch.  She was, at the time of which I am speaking, an orphan, having\nlost both her parents, and supported herself by keeping a small school.\nMy attachment was returned, and we had pledged our vows, but my father,\nwho could not reconcile himself to her lack of fortune, forbade our\nmarriage in the most positive terms.  He was wrong, for she was a fortune\nin herself--amiable and accomplished.  Oh! I cannot tell you all she\nwas--\" and here the old man drew his hand across his eyes.  \"By the death\nof my father, the only obstacle to our happiness appeared to be removed.\nWe agreed, therefore, that our marriage should take place within the\ncourse of a year; and I forthwith commenced enlarging my house and\ngetting my affairs in order.  Having been left in the easy circumstances\nwhich I have described, I determined to follow no business, but to pass\nmy life in a strictly domestic manner, and to be very, very happy.\nAmongst other property derived from my father were several horses, which\nI disposed of in this neighbourhood, with the exception of two remarkably\nfine ones, which I determined to take to the next fair at Horncastle, the\nonly place where I expected to be able to obtain what I considered to be\ntheir full value.  At length the time arrived for the commencement of the\nfair, which was within three months of the period which my beloved and\nmyself had fixed upon for the celebration of our nuptials.  To the fair I\nwent, a couple of trusty men following me with the horses.  I soon found\na purchaser for the animals, a portly, plausible person, of about forty,\ndressed in a blue riding coat, brown top boots, and leather breeches.\nThere was a strange-looking urchin with him, attired in nearly similar\nfashion, with a beam in one of his eyes, who called him father.  The man\npaid me for the purchase in bank-notes--three fifty-pound notes for the\ntwo horses.  As we were about to take leave of each other, he suddenly\nproduced another fifty-pound note, inquiring whether I could change it,\ncomplaining, at the same time, of the difficulty of procuring change in\nthe fair.  As I happened to have plenty of small money in my possession,\nand as I felt obliged to him for having purchased my horses at what I\nconsidered to be a good price, I informed him that I should be very happy\nto accommodate him; so I changed him the note, and he, having taken\npossession of the horses, went his way, and I myself returned home.\n\n\"A month passed; during this time I paid away two of the notes which I\nhad received at Horncastle from the dealer--one of them in my immediate\nneighbourhood, and the other at a town about fifteen miles distant, to\nwhich I had repaired for the purpose of purchasing some furniture.  All\nthings seemed to be going on most prosperously, and I felt quite happy,\nwhen one morning, as I was overlooking some workmen who were employed\nabout my house, I was accosted by a constable, who informed me that he\nwas sent to request my immediate appearance before a neighbouring bench\nof magistrates.  Concluding that I was merely summoned on some\nunimportant business connected with the neighbourhood, I felt no\nsurprise, and forthwith departed in company with the officer.  The\ndemeanour of the man upon the way struck me as somewhat singular.  I had\nfrequently spoken to him before, and had always found him civil and\nrespectful, but he was now reserved and sullen, and replied to two or\nthree questions which I put to him in anything but a courteous manner.  On\narriving at the place where the magistrates were sitting--an inn at a\nsmall town about two miles distant--I found a more than usual number of\npeople assembled, who appeared to be conversing with considerable\neagerness.  At sight of me they became silent, but crowded after me as I\nfollowed the man into the magistrates' room.  There I found the tradesman\nto whom I had paid the note for the furniture at the town fifteen miles\noff in attendance, accompanied by an agent of the Bank of England; the\nformer, it seems, had paid the note into a provincial bank, the\nproprietors of which, discovering it to be a forgery, had forthwith\nwritten up to the Bank of England, who had sent down their agent to\ninvestigate the matter.  A third individual stood beside them--the person\nin my own immediate neighbourhood to whom I had paid the second note;\nthis, by some means or other, before the coming down of the agent, had\nfound its way to the same provincial bank, and also being pronounced a\nforgery, it had speedily been traced to the person to whom I had paid it.\nIt was owing to the apparition of this second note that the agent had\ndetermined, without further inquiry, to cause me to be summoned before\nthe rural tribunal.\n\n\"In a few words the magistrates' clerk gave me to understand the state of\nthe case.  I was filled with surprise and consternation.  I knew myself\nto be perfectly innocent of any fraudulent intention, but at the time of\nwhich I am speaking it was a matter fraught with the greatest danger to\nbe mixed up, however innocently, with the passing of false money.  The\nlaw with respect to forgery was terribly severe, and the innocent as well\nas the guilty occasionally suffered.  Of this I was not altogether\nignorant; unfortunately, however, in my transactions with the stranger,\nthe idea of false notes being offered to me, and my being brought into\ntrouble by means of them, never entered my mind.  Recovering myself a\nlittle, I stated that the notes in question were two of three notes which\nI had received at Horncastle, for a pair of horses, which it was well\nknown I had carried thither.\n\n\"Thereupon, I produced from my pocket-book the third note, which was\nforthwith pronounced a forgery.  I had scarcely produced the third note,\nwhen I remembered the one which I had changed for the Horncastle dealer,\nand with the remembrance came the almost certain conviction that it was\nalso a forgery; I was tempted for a moment to produce it, and to explain\nthe circumstance--would to God I had done so!--but shame at the idea of\nhaving been so wretchedly duped prevented me, and the opportunity was\nlost.  I must confess that the agent of the bank behaved, upon the whole,\nin a very handsome manner; he said that as it was quite evident that I\nhad disposed of certain horses at the fair, it was very probable that I\nmight have received the notes in question in exchange for them, and that\nhe was willing, as he had received a very excellent account of my general\nconduct, to press the matter no farther, that is, provided--\"  And here\nhe stopped.  Thereupon, one of the three magistrates, who were present,\nasked me whether I chanced to have any more of these spurious notes in my\npossession.  He certainly had a right to ask the question; but there was\nsomething peculiar in his tone-insinuating suspicion.  It is certainly\ndifficult to judge of the motives which rule a person's conduct, but I\ncannot help imagining that he was somewhat influenced in his behaviour on\nthat occasion, which was anything but friendly, by my having refused to\nsell him the horses at a price less than that which I expected to get at\nthe fair; be this as it may, the question filled me with embarrassment,\nand I bitterly repented not having at first been more explicit.  Thereupon\nthe magistrate in the same kind of tone, demanded to see my pocket-book.\nI knew that to demur would be useless, and produced it, and therewith,\namongst two or three small country notes, appeared the fourth which I had\nreceived from the Horncastle dealer.  The agent took it up and examined\nit with attention.  'Well, is it a genuine note?' asked the magistrate.\n'I am sorry to say that it is not,' said the agent; 'it is a forgery,\nlike the other three.'  The magistrate shrugged his shoulders, as indeed\ndid several people in the room.  'A regular dealer in forged notes,' said\na person close behind me; 'who would have thought it?'\n\n\"Seeing matters begin to look so serious, I aroused myself, and\nendeavoured to speak in my own behalf, giving a candid account of the\nmanner in which I became possessed of the notes; but my explanation did\nnot appear to meet much credit; the magistrate, to whom I have in\nparticular alluded, asked, why I had not at once stated the fact of my\nhaving received a fourth note; and the agent, though in a very quiet\ntone, observed that he could not help thinking it somewhat strange that I\nshould have changed a note of so much value for a perfect stranger, even\nsupposing that he had purchased my horses, and had paid me their value in\nhard cash; and I noticed that he laid particular emphasis on the last\nwords.  I might have observed that I was an inexperienced young man, who,\nmeaning no harm myself, suspected none in others, but I was confused,\nstunned, and my tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of my mouth.  The men\nwho had taken my horses to Horncastle, and for whom I had sent, as they\nlived close at hand, now arrived, but the evidence which they could give\nwas anything but conclusive in my favour; they had seen me in company\nwith an individual at Horncastle, to whom, by my orders, they had\ndelivered certain horses, but they had seen no part of the money\ntransaction; the fellow, whether from design or not, having taken me\naside into a retired place, where he had paid me the three spurious\nnotes, and induced me to change the fourth, which throughout the affair\nwas what bore most materially against me.  How matters might have\nterminated I do not know, I might have gone to prison, and I might have\nbeen--just then, when I most needed a friend, and least expected to find\none, for though amongst those present there were several who were my\nneighbours, and who had professed friendship for me, none of them when\nthey saw that I needed support and encouragement, came forward to yield\nme any, but, on the contrary, appeared by their looks to enjoy my terror\nand confusion--just then a friend entered the room in the person of the\nsurgeon of the neighbourhood, the father of him who has attended you; he\nwas not on very intimate terms with me, but he had occasionally spoken to\nme, and had attended my father in his dying illness, and chancing to hear\nthat I was in trouble, he now hastened to assist me.  After a short\npreamble, in which he apologized to the bench for interfering, he begged\nto be informed of the state of the case, whereupon the matter was laid\nbefore him in all its details.  He was not slow in taking a fair view of\nit, and spoke well and eloquently in my behalf--insisting on the\nimprobability that a person of my habits and position would be wilfully\nmixed up with a transaction like that of which it appeared I was\nsuspected--adding, that as he was fully convinced of my innocence, he was\nready to enter into any surety with respect to my appearance at any time\nto answer anything which might be laid to my charge.  This last\nobservation had particular effect, and as he was a person universally\nrespected, both for his skill in his profession and his general\ndemeanour, people began to think that a person in whom he took an\ninterest could scarcely be concerned in anything criminal, and though my\nfriend the magistrate--I call him so ironically--made two or three\ndemurs, it was at last agreed between him and his brethren of the bench,\nthat, for the present, I should be merely called upon to enter into my\nown recognizance for the sum of two hundred pounds, to appear whenever it\nshould be deemed requisite to enter into any further investigation of the\nmatter.\n\n\"So I was permitted to depart from the tribunal of petty justice without\nhandcuffs, and uncollared by a constable; but people looked coldly and\nsuspiciously upon me.  The first thing I did was to hasten to the house\nof my beloved, in order to inform her of every circumstance attending the\ntransaction.  I found her, but how?  A malicious female individual had\nhurried to her with a distorted tale, to the effect that I had been taken\nup as an utterer of forged notes; that an immense number had been found\nin my possession; that I was already committed, and that probably I\nshould be executed.  My affianced one tenderly loved me, and her\nconstitution was delicate; fit succeeded fit; she broke a blood-vessel,\nand I found her deluged in blood; the surgeon had been sent for; he came\nand afforded her every possible relief.  I was distracted; he bade me\nhave hope, but I observed he looked very grave.\n\n\"By the skill of the surgeon, the poor girl was saved in the first\ninstance from the arms of death, and for a few weeks she appeared to be\nrapidly recovering; by degrees, however, she became melancholy; a worm\npreyed upon her spirit; a slow fever took possession of her frame.  I\nsubsequently learned that the same malicious female who had first carried\nto her an exaggerated account of the affair, and who was a distant\nrelative of her own, frequently visited her, and did all in her power to\nexcite her fears with respect to its eventual termination.  Time passed\non in a very wretched manner.  Our friend the surgeon showing to us both\nevery mark of kindness and attention.\n\n\"It was owing to this excellent man that my innocence was eventually\nestablished.  Having been called to a town on the borders of Yorkshire to\na medical consultation, he chanced to be taking a glass of wine with the\nlandlord of the inn at which he stopped, when the waiter brought in a\nnote to be changed, saying 'That the Quaker gentleman, who had been for\nsome days in the house, and was about to depart, had sent it to be\nchanged, in order that he might pay his bill.'  The landlord took the\nnote, and looked at it.  'A fifty-pound bill,' said he; 'I don't like\nchanging bills of that amount, lest they should prove bad ones; however,\nas it comes from a Quaker gentleman, I suppose it is all right.'  The\nmention of a fifty-pound note aroused the attention of my friend, and he\nrequested to be permitted to look at it; he had scarcely seen it, when he\nwas convinced that it was one of the same description as those which had\nbrought me into trouble, as it corresponded with them in two particular\nfeatures, which the agent of the bank had pointed out to him and others\nas evidence of their spuriousness.  My friend, without a moment's\nhesitation, informed the landlord that the note was a bad one, expressing\nat the same time a great wish to see the Quaker gentleman who wanted to\nhave it changed.  'That you can easily do,' said the landlord, and\nforthwith conducted him into the common room, where he saw a respectable-\nlooking man, dressed like a Quaker, and seemingly about sixty years of\nage.\n\n\"My friend, after a short apology, showed him the note which he held in\nhis hand, stating that he had no doubt it was a spurious one, and begged\nto be informed where he had taken it, adding, that a particular friend of\nhis was at present in trouble, owing to his having taken similar notes\nfrom a stranger at Horncastle; but that he hoped that he, the Quaker,\ncould give information, by means of which the guilty party, or parties,\ncould be arrested.  At the mention of Horncastle, it appeared to my\nfriend that the Quaker gave a slight start.  At the conclusion of this\nspeech, however, he answered, with great tranquillity, that he had\nreceived it in the way of business at ---, naming one of the principal\ntowns in Yorkshire, from a very respectable person, whose name he was\nperfectly willing to communicate, and likewise his own, which he said was\nJames, and that he was a merchant residing at Liverpool; that he would\nwrite to his friend at ---, requesting him to make inquiries on the\nsubject; that just at that moment he was in a hurry to depart, having\nsome particular business at a town about ten miles off, to go to which he\nhad bespoken a post-chaise of the landlord; that with respect to the\nnote, it was doubtless a very disagreeable thing to have a suspicious one\nin his possession, but that it would make little difference to him, as he\nhad plenty of other money, and thereupon he pulled out a purse,\ncontaining various other notes, and some gold, observing, 'that his only\nmotive for wishing to change the other note was a desire to be well\nprovided with change;' and finally, that if they had any suspicion with\nrespect to him, he was perfectly willing to leave the note in their\npossession till he should return, which he intended to do in about a\nfortnight.  There was so much plausibility in the speech of the Quaker,\nand his appearance and behaviour were so perfectly respectable, that my\nfriend felt almost ashamed of the suspicion which at first he had\nentertained of him, though, at the same time, he felt an unaccountable\nunwillingness to let the man depart without some further interrogation.\nThe landlord, however, who did not wish to disoblige one who had been,\nand might probably be again, a profitable customer, declared that he was\nperfectly satisfied; and that he had no wish to detain the note, which he\nmade no doubt the gentleman had received in the way of business, and that\nas the matter concerned him alone, he would leave it to him to make the\nnecessary inquiries.  'Just as you please, friend,' said the Quaker,\npocketing the suspicious note, 'I will now pay my bill.'  Thereupon he\ndischarged the bill with a five-pound note, which he begged the landlord\nto inspect carefully, and with two pieces of gold.\n\n\"The landlord had just taken the money, receipted the bill, and was\nbowing to his customer, when the door opened, and a lad, dressed in a\nkind of grey livery, appeared, and informed the Quaker that the chaise\nwas ready.  'Is that boy your servant?' said the surgeon.  'He is,\nfriend,' said the Quaker.  'Hast thou any reason for asking me that\nquestion?'  'And has he been long in your service?'  'Several years,'\nreplied the Quaker, 'I took him into my house out of compassion, he being\nan orphan, but as the chaise is waiting, I will bid thee farewell.'  'I\nam afraid I must stop your journey for the present,' said the surgeon;\n'that boy has exactly the same blemish in the eye which a boy had who was\nin company with the man at Horncastle, from whom my friend received the\nforged notes, and who there passed for his son.'  'I know nothing about\nthat,' said the Quaker, 'but I am determined to be detained here no\nlonger, after the satisfactory account which I have given as to the\nnote's coming into my possession.'  He then attempted to leave the room,\nbut my friend detained him, a struggle ensued, during which a wig which\nthe Quaker wore fell off, whereupon he instantly appeared to lose some\ntwenty years of his age.  'Knock the fellow down, father,' said the boy,\n'I'll help you.'\n\n\"And, forsooth, the pretended Quaker took the boy's advice, and knocked\nmy friend down in a twinkling.  The landlord, however, and waiter, seeing\nhow matters stood, instantly laid hold of him; but there can be no doubt\nthat he would have escaped from the whole three, had not certain guests\nwho were in the house, hearing the noise, rushed in, and helped to secure\nhim.  The boy was true to his word, assisting him to the best of his\nability, flinging himself between the legs of his father's assailants,\ncausing several of them to stumble and fall.  At length, the fellow was\nsecured, and led before a magistrate; the boy, to whom he was heard to\nsay something which nobody understood, and to whom, after the man's\ncapture, no one paid much attention, was no more seen.\n\n\"The rest, as far as this man was concerned, may be told in a few words;\nnothing to criminate him was found on his person, but on his baggage\nbeing examined, a quantity of spurious notes were discovered.  Much of\nhis hardihood now forsook him, and in the hope of saving his life he made\nsome very important disclosures; amongst other things, he confessed that\nit was he who had given me the notes in exchange for the horses, and also\nthe note to be changed.  He was subsequently tried on two indictments, in\nthe second of which I appeared against him.  He was condemned to die;\nbut, in consideration of the disclosures he had made, his sentence was\ncommuted to perpetual transportation.\n\n\"My innocence was thus perfectly established before the eyes of the\nworld, and all my friends hastened to congratulate me.  There was one who\ncongratulated me more than all the rest--it was my beloved one,\nbut--but--she was dying--\"\n\nHere the old man drew his hand before his eyes, and remained for some\ntime without speaking; at length he removed his hand, and commenced again\nwith a broken voice: \"You will pardon me if I hurry over this part of my\nstory, I am unable to dwell upon it.  How dwell upon a period when I saw\nmy only earthly treasure pine away gradually day by day, and knew that\nnothing could save her!  She saw my agony, and did all she could to\nconsole me, saying that she was herself quite resigned.  A little time\nbefore her death she expressed a wish that we should be united.  I was\ntoo happy to comply with her request.  We were united, I brought her to\nthis house, where, in less than a week, she expired in my arms.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\nThe Old Man's Story continued--Misery in the Head--The Strange Marks--Tea-\ndealer from London--Difficulties of the Chinese Language.\n\nAfter another pause the old man once more resumed his narration:--\"If\never there was a man perfectly miserable it was myself, after the loss of\nthat cherished woman.  I sat solitary in the house, in which I had hoped\nin her company to realize the choicest earthly happiness, a prey to the\nbitterest reflections; many people visited, and endeavoured to console\nme--amongst them was the clergyman of the parish, who begged me to be\nresigned, and told me that it was good to be afflicted.  I bowed my head,\nbut I could not help thinking how easy it must be for those who feel no\naffliction, to bid others to be resigned, and to talk of the benefit\nresulting from sorrow; perhaps I should have paid more attention to his\ndiscourse than I did, provided he had been a person for whom it was\npossible to entertain much respect, but his own heart was known to be set\non the things of this world.\n\n\"Within a little time he had an opportunity, in his own case, of\npractising resignation, and of realizing the benefit of being afflicted.\nA merchant, to whom he had entrusted all his fortune, in the hope of a\nlarge interest, became suddenly a bankrupt, with scarcely any assets.  I\nwill not say that it was owing to this misfortune that the divine died in\nless than a month after its occurrence, but such was the fact.  Amongst\nthose who most frequently visited me was my friend the surgeon; he did\nnot confine himself to the common topics of consolation, but endeavoured\nto impress upon me the necessity of rousing myself, advising me to occupy\nmy mind with some pursuit, particularly recommending agriculture; but\nagriculture possessed no interest for me, nor, indeed, any pursuit within\nmy reach; my hopes of happiness had been blighted, and what cared I for\nanything? so at last he thought it best to leave me to myself, hoping\nthat time would bring with it consolation; and I remained solitary in my\nhouse, waited upon by a male and a female servant.  Oh, what dreary\nmoments I passed!  My only amusement--and it was a sad one--was to look\nat the things which once belonged to my beloved, and which were now in my\npossession.  Oh, how fondly would I dwell upon them!  There were some\nbooks; I cared not for books, but these had belonged to my beloved.  Oh,\nhow fondly did I dwell on them!  Then there was her hat and bonnet--oh,\nme, how fondly did I gaze upon them! and after looking at her things for\nhours, I would sit and ruminate on the happiness I had lost.  How I\nexecrated the moment I had gone to the fair to sell horses!  'Would that\nI had never been to Horncastle to sell horses!' I would say; 'I might at\nthis moment have been enjoying the company of my beloved, leading a\nhappy, quiet, easy life, but for that fatal expedition;' that thought\nworked on my brain, till my brain seemed to turn round.\n\n\"One day I sat at the breakfast-table gazing vacantly around me, my mind\nwas in a state of inexpressible misery; there was a whirl in my brain,\nprobably like that which people feel who are rapidly going mad; this\nincreased to such a degree that I felt giddiness coming upon me.  To\nabate this feeling I no longer permitted my eyes to wander about, but\nfixed them upon an object on the table, and continued gazing at it for\nseveral minutes without knowing what it was; at length, the misery in my\nhead was somewhat stilled, my lips moved, and I heard myself saying,\n'What odd marks!'  I had fastened my eyes on the side of a teapot, and by\nkeeping them fixed upon it, had become aware of a fact that had escaped\nmy notice before--namely, that there were marks upon it.  I kept my eyes\nfixed upon them, and repeated at intervals, 'What strange marks!'--for I\nthought that looking upon the marks tended to abate the whirl in my head:\nI kept tracing the marks one after the other, and I observed that though\nthey all bore a general resemblance to each other, they were all to a\ncertain extent different.  The smallest portion possible of curious\ninterest had been awakened within me, and, at last, I asked myself,\nwithin my own mind, 'What motive could induce people to put such odd\nmarks on their crockery? they were not pictures, they were not letters;\nwhat motive could people have for putting them there?'  At last I removed\nmy eyes from the teapot, and thought for a few moments about the marks;\npresently, however, I felt the whirl returning; the marks became almost\neffaced from my mind, and I was beginning to revert to my miserable\nruminations, when suddenly methought I heard a voice say, 'The marks! the\nmarks! cling to the marks? or--'  So I fixed my eyes again upon the\nmarks, inspecting them more attentively, if possible, than I had done\nbefore, and, at last, I came to the conclusion that they were not\ncapricious or fanciful marks, but were arranged systematically; when I\nhad gazed at them for a considerable time, I turned the teapot round, and\non the other side I observed marks of a similar kind, which I soon\ndiscovered were identical with the ones I had been observing.  All the\nmarks were something alike, but all somewhat different, and on comparing\nthem with each other, I was struck with the frequent occurrence of a mark\ncrossing an upright line, or projecting from it, now on the right, now on\nthe left side; and I said to myself, 'Why does this mark sometimes cross\nthe upright line, and sometimes project?' and the more I thought on the\nmatter, the less did I feel of the misery in my head.\n\n\"The things were at length removed, and I sat, as I had for some time\npast been wont to sit after my meals, silent and motionless; but in the\npresent instance my mind was not entirely abandoned to the one mournful\nidea which had so long distressed it.  It was, to a certain extent,\noccupied with the marks on the teapot; it is true that the mournful idea\nstrove hard with the marks on the teapot for the mastery in my mind, and\nat last the painful idea drove the marks of the teapot out; they,\nhowever, would occasionally return and flit across my mind for a moment\nor two, and their coming was like a momentary relief from intense pain.  I\nthought once or twice that I would have the teapot placed before me, that\nI might examine the marks at leisure, but I considered that it would be\nas well to defer the re-examination of the marks till the next morning;\nat that time I did not take tea of an evening.  By deferring the\nexamination thus, I had something to look forward to on the next morning.\nThe day was a melancholy one, but it certainly was more tolerable to me\nthan any of the others had been since the death of my beloved.  As I lay\nawake that night I occasionally thought of the marks, and in my sleep\nmethought I saw them upon the teapot vividly before me.  On the morrow, I\nexamined the marks again; how singular they looked!  Surely they must\nmean something, and if so, what could they mean? and at last I thought\nwithin myself whether it would be possible for me to make out what they\nmeant: that day I felt more relief than on the preceding one, and towards\nnight I walked a little about.\n\n\"In about a week's time I received a visit from my friend the surgeon;\nafter a little discourse, he told me that he perceived I was better than\nwhen he had last seen me, and asked me what I had been about; I told him\nthat I had been principally occupied in considering certain marks which I\nhad found on a teapot, and wondering what they could mean; he smiled at\nfirst, but instantly assuming a serious look, he asked to see the teapot.\nI produced it, and after having surveyed the marks with attention, he\nobserved that they were highly curious, and also wondered what they\nmeant.  'I strongly advise you,' said he, 'to attempt to make them out,\nand also to take moderate exercise, and to see after your concerns.'  I\nfollowed his advice; every morning I studied the marks on the teapot, and\nin the course of the day took moderate exercise, and attended to little\ndomestic matters, as became the master of a house.\n\n\"I subsequently learned that the surgeon, in advising me to study the\nmarks, and endeavour to make out their meaning, merely hoped that by\nmeans of them my mind might by degrees be diverted from the mournful idea\non which I had so long brooded.  He was a man well skilled in his\nprofession, but had read and thought very little on matters unconnected\nwith it.  He had no idea that the marks had any particular signification,\nor were anything else but common and fortuitous ones.  That I became at\nall acquainted with their nature was owing to a ludicrous circumstance\nwhich I will now relate.\n\n\"One day, chancing to be at a neighbouring town, I was struck with the\nappearance of a shop recently established.  It had an immense bow-window,\nand every part of it, to which a brush could be applied, was painted in a\ngaudy flaming style.  Large bowls of green and black tea were placed upon\ncertain chests, which stood at the window.  I stopped to look at them,\nsuch a display, whatever it may be at the present time, being, at the\nperiod of which I am speaking, quite uncommon in a country town.  The\ntea, whether black or green, was very shining and inviting, and the\nbowls, of which there were three, standing on as many chests, were very\ngrand and foreign looking.  Two of these were white, with figures and\ntrees painted upon them in blue; the other, which was the middlemost, had\nneither trees nor figures upon it, but, as I looked through the window,\nappeared to have on its sides the very same kind of marks which I had\nobserved on the teapot at home; there were also marks on the tea-chests,\nsomewhat similar, but much larger, and, apparently, not executed with so\nmuch care.  'Best teas direct from China,' said a voice close to my side;\nand looking round I saw a youngish man, with a frizzled head, flat face,\nand an immensely wide mouth, standing in his shirt-sleeves by the door.\n'Direct from China,' said he; 'perhaps you will do me the favour to walk\nin and scent them?'  'I do not want any tea,' said I; 'I was only\nstanding at the window examining those marks on the bowl and the chests.\nI have observed similar ones on a teapot at home.'  'Pray walk in, sir,'\nsaid the young fellow, extending his mouth till it reached nearly from\near to ear; 'pray walk in, and I shall be happy to give you any\ninformation respecting the manners and customs of the Chinese in my\npower.'  Thereupon I followed him into his shop, where he began to\nharangue on the manners, customs, and peculiarities of the Chinese,\nespecially their manner of preparing tea, not forgetting to tell me that\nthe only genuine Chinese tea ever imported into England was to be found\nin his shop.  'With respect to those marks,' said he, 'on the bowl and\nchests, they are nothing more nor less than Chinese writing expressing\nsomething, though what I can't exactly tell you.  Allow me to sell you\nthis pound of tea,' he added, showing me a paper parcel.  'On the\nenvelope there is a printed account of the Chinese system of writing,\nextracted from authors of the most established reputation.  These things\nI print, principally with the hope of, in some degree, removing the worse\nthan Gothic ignorance prevalent amongst natives of these parts.  I am\nfrom London myself.  With respect to all that relates to the Chinese real\nimperial tea, I assure you sir, that--'  Well, to make short of what you\ndoubtless consider a very tiresome story, I purchased the tea and carried\nit home.  The tea proved imperially bad, but the paper envelope really\ncontained some information on the Chinese language and writing, amounting\nto about as much as you gained from me the other day.  On learning that\nthe marks on the teapot expressed words, I felt my interest with respect\nto them considerably increased, and returned to the task of inspecting\nthem with greater zeal than before, hoping, by continually looking at\nthem, to be able eventually to understand their meaning, in which hope\nyou may easily believe I was disappointed, though my desire to understand\nwhat they represented continued on the increase.  In this dilemma I\ndetermined to apply again to the shopkeeper from whom I bought the tea.  I\nfound him in rather low spirits, his shirt-sleeves were soiled, and his\nhair was out of curl.  On my inquiring how he got on, he informed me that\nhe intended speedily to leave, having received little or no\nencouragement, the people, in their Gothic ignorance, preferring to deal\nwith an old-fashioned shopkeeper over the way, who, so far from\npossessing any acquaintance with the polity and institutions of the\nChinese, did not, he believed, know that tea came from China.  'You are\ncome for some more, I suppose?' said he.  On receiving an answer in the\nnegative he looked somewhat blank, but when I added that I came to\nconsult with him as to the means which I must take in order to acquire\nthe Chinese language he brightened up.  'You must get a grammar,' said\nhe, rubbing his hands.  'Have you not one?' said I.  'No,' he replied,\n'but any bookseller can procure you one.'  As I was taking my departure,\nhe told me that as he was about to leave the neighbourhood, the bowl at\nthe window, which bore the inscription, besides some other pieces of\nporcelain of a similar description, were at my service, provided I chose\nto purchase them.  I consented, and two or three days afterwards took\nfrom off his hands all the china in his possession which bore the\ninscriptions, paying what he demanded.  Had I waited till the sale of his\neffects, which occurred within a few weeks, I could probably have\nprocured it for a fifth part of the sum which I paid, the other pieces\nrealizing very little.  I did not, however, grudge the poor fellow what\nhe got from me, as I considered myself to be somewhat in his debt for the\ninformation he had afforded me.\n\n\"As for the rest of my story, it may be briefly told.  I followed the\nadvice of the shopkeeper, and applied to a bookseller who wrote to his\ncorrespondent in London.  After a long interval, I was informed that if I\nwished to learn Chinese, I must do so through the medium of French, there\nbeing neither Chinese grammar nor dictionary in our language.  I was at\nfirst very much disheartened.  I determined, however, at last to gratify\nmy desire of learning Chinese, even at the expense of learning French.  I\nprocured the books, and in order to qualify myself to turn them to\naccount, took lessons in French from a little Swiss, the usher of a\nneighbouring boarding-school.  I was very stupid in acquiring French;\nperseverance, however, enabled me to acquire a knowledge sufficient for\nthe object I had in view.  In about two years I began to study Chinese by\nmyself, through the medium of the French.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"and how did you get on with the study of the Chinese?\"\n\nAnd then the old man proceeded to inform me how he got on with the study\nof Chinese, enumerated all the difficulties he had had to encounter;\ndilating upon his frequent despondency of mind, and occasionally his\nutter despair of ever mastering Chinese.  He told me that more than once\nhe had determined upon giving up the study, but when the misery in his\nhead forthwith returned, to escape from which he had as often resumed it.\nIt appeared, however, that ten years elapsed before he was able to use\nten of the two hundred and fourteen keys, which serve to undo the locks\nof Chinese writing.\n\n\"And are you able at present to use the entire number?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man; \"I can at present use the whole number.  I know\nthe key for every particular lock, though I frequently find the wards\nunwilling to give way.\"\n\n\"Has nothing particular occurred to you,\" said I, \"during the time that\nyou have been prosecuting your studies?\"\n\n\"During the whole time in which I have been engaged in these studies,\"\nsaid the old man, \"only one circumstance has occurred which requires any\nparticular mention--the death of my old friend the surgeon--who was\ncarried off suddenly by a fit of apoplexy.  His death was a great shock\nto me, and for a time interrupted my studies.  His son, however, who\nsucceeded him, was very kind to me, and, in some degree, supplied his\nfather's place; and I gradually returned to my Chinese locks and keys.\"\n\n\"And in applying keys to the Chinese locks you employ your time?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man, \"in making out the inscriptions on the various\npieces of porcelain, which I have at different times procured, I pass my\ntime.  The first inscription which I translated was that on the teapot of\nmy beloved.\"\n\n\"And how many other pieces of porcelain may you have at present in your\npossession?\"\n\n\"About fifteen hundred.\"\n\n\"And how did you obtain them?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Without much labour,\" said the old man, \"in the neighbouring towns and\nvillages--chiefly at auctions--of which, about twenty years ago, there\nwere many in these parts.\"\n\n\"And may I ask your reasons for confining your studies entirely to the\ncrockery literature of China, when you have all the rest at your\ndisposal?\"\n\n\"The inscriptions enable me to pass my time,\" said the old man; \"what\nmore would the whole literature of China do?\"\n\n\"And from these inscriptions,\" said I, \"what a book it is in your power\nto make, whenever so disposed.  'Translations from the crockery\nliterature of China.'  Such a book would be sure to take; even glorious\nJohn himself would not disdain to publish it.\"  The old man smiled.  \"I\nhave no desire for literary distinction,\" said he; \"no ambition.  My\noriginal wish was to pass my life in easy, quiet obscurity, with her whom\nI loved.  I was disappointed in my wish; she was removed, who constituted\nmy only felicity in this life; desolation came to my heart, and misery to\nmy head.  To escape from the latter I had recourse to Chinese.  By\ndegrees the misery left my head, but the desolation of the heart yet\nremains.\"\n\n\"Be of good cheer,\" said I; \"through the instrumentality of this\naffliction you have learnt Chinese, and, in so doing, learnt to practise\nthe duties of hospitality.  Who but a man who could read Runes on a\nteapot, would have received an unfortunate wayfarer as you have received\nme?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the old man, \"let us hope that all is for the best.  I am by\nnature indolent, and, but for this affliction, should, perhaps, have\nhardly taken the trouble to do my duty to my fellow-creatures.  I am\nvery, very indolent,\" said he, slightly glancing towards the clock;\n\"therefore let us hope that all is for the best; but, oh! these trials,\nthey are very hard to bear.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n\nThe Leave-taking--Spirit of the Hearth--What's o'Clock?\n\nThe next morning, having breakfasted with my old friend, I went into the\nstable to make the necessary preparations for my departure; there, with\nthe assistance of a stable lad, I cleaned and caparisoned my horse, and\nthen, returning into the house, I made the old female attendant such a\npresent as I deemed would be some compensation for the trouble I had\ncaused.  Hearing that the old gentleman was in his study, I repaired to\nhim.  \"I am come to take leave of you,\" said I, \"and to thank you for all\nthe hospitality which I have received at your hands.\"  The eyes of the\nold man were fixed steadfastly on the inscription which I had found him\nstudying on a former occasion.  \"At length,\" he murmured to himself, \"I\nhave it--I think I have it;\" and then, looking at me, he said, \"So you\nare about to depart?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"my horse will be at the front door in a few minutes; I am\nglad, however, before I go, to find that you have mastered the\ninscription.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man, \"I believe I have mastered it; it seems to\nconsist of some verses relating to the worship of the Spirit of the\nHearth.\"\n\n\"What is the Spirit of the Hearth?\" said I.\n\n\"One of the many demons which the Chinese worship,\" said the old man;\n\"they do not worship one God, but many.\"  And then the old man told me a\ngreat many highly-interesting particulars respecting the demon worship of\nthe Chinese.\n\nAfter the lapse of at least half an hour I said, \"I must not linger here\nany longer, however willing.  Horncastle is distant, and I wish to be\nthere to-night.  Pray can you inform me what's o'clock?\"\n\nThe old man, rising, looked towards the clock which hung on the side of\nthe room at his left hand, on the farther side of the table at which he\nwas seated.\n\n\"I am rather short-sighted,\" said I, \"and cannot distinguish the number,\nat that distance.\"\n\n\"It is ten o'clock,\" said the old man; \"I believe somewhat past.\"\n\n\"A quarter, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man \"a quarter or--\"\n\n\"Or?\"\n\n\"Seven minutes, or ten minutes past ten.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you.\"\n\n\"Why, to tell you the truth,\" said the old man, with a smile, \"there is\none thing to the knowledge of which I could never exactly attain.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say,\" said I, \"that you do not know what's o'clock?\"\n\n\"I can give a guess,\" said the old man, \"to within a few minutes.\"\n\n\"But you cannot tell the exact moment?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the old man.\n\n\"In the name of wonder,\" said I, \"with that thing there on the wall\ncontinually ticking in your ear, how comes it that you do not know what's\no'clock?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said the old man, \"I have contented myself with giving a tolerably\ngood guess; to do more would have been too great trouble.\"\n\n\"But you have learnt Chinese,\" said I.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man, \"I have learnt Chinese.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I really would counsel you to learn to know what's\no'clock as soon as possible.  Consider what a sad thing it would be to go\nout of the world not knowing what's o'clock.  A millionth part of the\ntrouble required to learn Chinese would, if employed, infallibly teach\nyou to know what's o'clock.\"\n\n\"I had a motive for learning Chinese,\" said the old man, \"the hope of\nappeasing the misery in my head.  With respect to not knowing what's\no'clock, I cannot see anything particularly sad in the matter.  A man may\nget through the world very creditably without knowing what's o'clock.\nYet, upon the whole, it is no bad thing to know what's o'clock--you, of\ncourse, do?  It would be too good a joke if two people were to be\ntogether, one knowing Armenian and the other Chinese, and neither knowing\nwhat's o'clock.  I'll now see you off.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\n\nArrival at Horncastle--The Inn and Ostlers--The Garret--Figure of a Man\nwith a Candle.\n\nLeaving the house of the old man who knew Chinese, but could not tell\nwhat was o'clock, I wended my way to Horncastle, which I reached in the\nevening of the same day, without having met any adventure on the way\nworthy of being marked down in this very remarkable history.\n\nThe town was a small one, seemingly ancient, and was crowded with people\nand horses.  I proceeded, without delay, to the inn to which my friend\nthe surgeon had directed me.  \"It is of no use coming here,\" said two or\nthree ostlers, as I entered the yard--\"all full--no room whatever;\"\nwhilst one added in an undertone, \"That ere a'n't a bad-looking horse.\"\n\"I want to see the master of this inn,\" said I, as I dismounted from the\nhorse.  \"See the master,\" said an ostler--the same who had paid the\nnegative kind of compliment to the horse--\"a likely thing, truly; my\nmaster is drinking wine with some of the grand gentry, and can't be\ndisturbed for the sake of the like of you.\"  \"I bring a letter to him,\"\nsaid I, pulling out the surgeon's epistle.  \"I wish you would deliver it\nto him,\" I added, offering a half-crown.  \"Oh, it's you, is it?\" said the\nostler, taking the letter and the half-crown; \"my master will be right\nglad to see you; why, you ha'n't been here for many a year; I'll carry\nthe note to him at once.\"  And with these words he hurried into the\nhouse.  \"That's a nice horse, young man,\" said another ostler, \"what will\nyou take for it?\" to which interrogation I made no answer.  \"If you wish\nto sell him,\" said the ostler, coming up to me, and winking knowingly, \"I\nthink I and my partners might offer you a summut under seventy pounds;\"\nto which kind and half-insinuated offer I made no reply, save by winking\nin the same kind of knowing manner in which I observed him wink.  \"Rather\nleary!\" said a third ostler.  \"Well, young man, perhaps you will drink to-\nnight with me and my partners, when we can talk the matter over.\"  Before\nI had time to answer, the landlord, a well-dressed, good-looking man,\nmade his appearance with the ostler; he bore the letter in his hand.\nWithout glancing at me, he betook himself at once to consider the horse,\ngoing round him, and observing every point with the utmost minuteness.  At\nlast, having gone round the horse three times, he stopped beside me, and\nkeeping his eyes on the horse, bent his head towards his right shoulder.\n\"That horse is worth some money,\" said he, turning towards me suddenly,\nand slightly touching me on the arm with the letter which he held in his\nhand; to which observation I made no reply, save by bending my head\ntowards the right shoulder as I had seen him do.  \"The young man is going\nto talk to me and my partners about it to-night,\" said the ostler who had\nexpressed an opinion that he and his friends might offer me somewhat\nunder seventy pounds for the animal.  \"Pooh!\" said the landlord, \"the\nyoung man knows what he is about; in the meantime lead the horse to the\nreserved stall, and see well after him.  My friend,\" said he, taking me\naside after the ostler had led the animal away, \"recommends you to me in\nthe strongest manner, on which account alone I take you and your horse\nin.  I need not advise you not to be taken in, as I should say, by your\nlook, that you are tolerably awake; but there are queer hands at\nHorncastle at this time, and those fellows of mine, you understand me--;\nbut I have a great deal to do at present, so you must excuse me.\"  And\nthereupon went into the house.\n\nThat same evening I was engaged at least two hours in the stable, in\nrubbing the horse down, and preparing him for the exhibition which I\nintended he should make in the fair on the following day.  The ostler, to\nwhom I had given the half-crown, occasionally assisted me, though he was\ntoo much occupied by the horses of other guests to devote any length of\ntime to the service of mine; he more than once repeated to me his firm\nconviction that himself and partners could afford to offer me summut for\nthe horse; and at a later hour when, in compliance with his invitation, I\ntook a glass of summut with himself and partners, in a little room\nsurrounded with corn-chests, on which we sat, both himself and partners\nendeavoured to impress upon me, chiefly by means of nods and winks, their\nconviction that they could afford to give me summut for the horse,\nprovided I were disposed to sell him; in return for which intimation,\nwith as many nods and winks as they had all collectively used, I\nendeavoured to impress upon them my conviction that I could get summut\nhandsomer in the fair than they might be disposed to offer me, seeing as\nhow--which how I followed by a wink and a nod, which they seemed\nperfectly to understand, one or two of them declaring that if the case\nwas so, it made a great deal of difference, and that they did not wish to\nbe any hindrance to me, more particularly as it was quite clear I had\nbeen an ostler like themselves.\n\nIt was late at night when I began to think of retiring to rest.  On\ninquiring if there was any place in which I could sleep, I was informed\nthat there was a bed at my service, provided I chose to sleep in a two-\nbedded room, one of the beds of which was engaged by another gentleman.  I\nexpressed my satisfaction at this arrangement, and was conducted by a\nmaid-servant up many pairs of stairs to a garret, in which were two small\nbeds, in one of which she gave me to understand another gentleman slept;\nhe had, however, not yet retired to rest; I asked who he was, but the\nmaid-servant could give me no information about him, save that he was a\nhighly respectable gentleman, and a friend of her master's.  Presently,\nbidding me good night, she left me with a candle; and I, having undressed\nmyself and extinguished the light, went to bed.  Notwithstanding the\nnoises which sounded from every part of the house, I was not slow in\nfalling asleep, being thoroughly tired.  I know not how long I might have\nbeen in bed, perhaps two hours, when I was partially awakened by a light\nshining upon my face, whereupon, unclosing my eyes, I perceived the\nfigure of a man, with a candle in one hand, staring at my face, whilst\nwith the other hand, he held back the curtain of the bed.  As I have said\nbefore, I was only partially awakened, my power of conception was\nconsequently very confused; it appeared to me, however, that the man was\ndressed in a green coat; that he had curly brown or black hair, and that\nthere was something peculiar in his look.  Just as I was beginning to\nrecollect myself, the curtain dropped, and I heard, or thought I heard, a\nvoice say, \"Don't know the cove.\"  Then there was a rustling like a\nperson undressing, whereupon being satisfied that it was my\nfellow-lodger, I dropped asleep, but was awakened again by a kind of\nheavy plunge upon the other bed, which caused it to rock and creak, when\nI observed that the light had been extinguished, probably blown out, if I\nmight judge from a rather disagreeable smell of burnt wick which remained\nin the room, and which kept me awake till I heard my companion breathing\nhard, when, turning on the other side, I was again once more speedily in\nthe arms of slumber.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n\nHorncastle Fair.\n\nIt had been my intention to be up and doing early on the following\nmorning, but my slumbers proved so profound, that I did not wake until\nabout eight; on arising, I again found myself the sole occupant of the\napartment, my more alert companion having probably risen at a much\nearlier hour.  Having dressed myself, I descended, and going to the\nstable, found my horse under the hands of my friend the ostler, who was\ncarefully rubbing him down.  \"There a'n't a better horse in the fair,\"\nsaid he to me, \"and as you are one of us, and appear to be all right,\nI'll give you a piece of advice--don't take less than a hundred and fifty\nfor him; if you mind your hits, you may get it, for I have known two\nhundred given in this fair for one no better, if so good.\"  \"Well,\" said\nI, \"thank you for your advice, which I will take, and, if successful,\nwill give you 'summut' handsome.\"  \"Thank you,\" said the ostler; \"and now\nlet me ask whether you are up to all the ways of this here place?\"  \"I\nhave never been here before,\" said I, \"but I have a pair of tolerably\nsharp eyes in my head.\"  \"That I see you have,\" said the ostler, \"but\nmany a body, with as sharp a pair of eyes as yourn, has lost his horse in\nthis fair, for want of having been here before, therefore,\" said he,\n\"I'll give you a caution or two.\"  Thereupon the ostler proceeded to give\nme at least half a dozen cautions, only two of which I shall relate to\nthe reader:--the first, not to stop to listen to what any chance customer\nmight have to say; and the last--the one on which he appeared to lay most\nstress--by no manner of means to permit a Yorkshireman to get up into the\nsaddle, \"for,\" said he, \"if you do, it is three to one that he rides off\nwith the horse; he can't help it; trust a cat amongst cream, but never\ntrust a Yorkshireman on the saddle of a good horse; by-the-by,\" he\ncontinued, \"that saddle of yours is not a particularly good one, no more\nis the bridle.  I tell you what, as you seem a decent kind of a young\nchap, I'll lend you a saddle and bridle of my master's, almost bran new;\nhe won't object, I know, as you are a friend of his, only you must not\nforget your promise to come down with summut handsome after you have sold\nthe animal.\"\n\nAfter a slight breakfast I mounted the horse, which, decked out in his\nborrowed finery, really looked better by a large sum of money than on any\nformer occasion.  Making my way out of the yard of the inn, I was\ninstantly in the principal street of the town, up and down which an\nimmense number of horses were being exhibited, some led, and others with\nriders.  \"A wonderful small quantity of good horses in the fair this\ntime!\" I heard a stout jockey-looking individual say, who was staring up\nthe street with his side towards me.  \"Halloo, young fellow!\" said he, a\nfew moments after I had passed, \"whose horse is that?  Stop!  I want to\nlook at him!\"  Though confident that he was addressing himself to me, I\ntook no notice, remembering the advice of the ostler, and proceeded up\nthe street.  My horse possessed a good walking step; but walking, as the\nreader knows, was not his best pace, which was the long trot, at which I\ncould not well exercise him in the street, on account of the crowd of men\nand animals; however, as he walked along, I could easily perceive that he\nattracted no slight attention amongst those who, by their jockey dress\nand general appearance, I imagined to be connoisseurs; I heard various\ncalls to stop, to none of which I paid the slightest attention.  In a few\nminutes I found myself out of the town, when, turning round for the\npurpose of returning, I found I had been followed by several of the\nconnoisseur-looking individuals, whom I had observed in the fair.  \"Now\nwould be the time for a display,\" thought I; and looking around me I\nobserved two five-barred gates, one on each side of the road, and\nfronting each other.  Turning my horse's head to one, I pressed my heels\nto his sides, loosened the reins, and gave an encouraging cry, whereupon\nthe animal cleared the gate in a twinkling.  Before he had advanced ten\nyards in the field to which the gate opened, I had turned him round, and\nagain giving him cry and rein, I caused him to leap back again into the\nroad, and still allowing him head, I made him leap the other gate; and\nforthwith turning him round, I caused him to leap once more into the\nroad, where he stood proudly tossing his head, as much as to say, \"What\nmore?\"  \"A fine horse! a capital horse!\" said several of the\nconnoisseurs.  \"What do you ask for him?\"  \"Too much for any of you to\npay,\" said I.  \"A horse like this is intended for other kind of customers\nthan any of you.\"  \"How do you know that?\" said one; the very same person\nwhom I had heard complaining in the street of the paucity of good horses\nin the fair.  \"Come, let us know what you ask for him?\"  \"A hundred and\nfifty pounds!\" said I; \"neither more nor less.\"  \"Do you call that a\ngreat price?\" said the man.  \"Why, I thought you would have asked double\nthat amount!  You do yourself injustice, young man.\"  \"Perhaps I do,\"\nsaid I, \"but that's my affair; I do not choose to take more.\"  \"I wish\nyou would let me get into the saddle,\" said the man; \"the horse knows\nyou, and therefore shows to more advantage; but I should like to see how\nhe would move under me, who am a stranger.  Will you let me get into the\nsaddle, young man?\"  \"No,\" said I; \"I will not let you get into the\nsaddle.\"  \"Why not?\" said the man.  \"Lest you should be a Yorkshireman,\"\nsaid I; \"and should run away with the horse.\"  \"Yorkshire?\" said the man;\n\"I am from Suffolk; silly Suffolk--so you need not be afraid of my\nrunning away with the horse.\"  \"Oh! if that's the case,\" said I, \"I\nshould be afraid that the horse would run away with you; so I will by no\nmeans let you mount.\"  \"Will you let me look in his mouth?\" said the man.\n\"If you please,\" said I; \"but I tell you, he's apt to bite.\"  \"He can\nscarcely be a worse bite than his master,\" said the man, looking into the\nhorse's mouth; \"he's four off.  I say, young man, will you warrant this\nhorse?\"  \"No,\" said I; \"I never warrant horses; the horses that I ride\ncan always warrant themselves.\"  \"I wish you would let me speak a word to\nyou,\" said he.  \"Just come aside.  It's a nice horse,\" said he, in a half\nwhisper, after I had ridden a few paces aside with him.  \"It's a nice\nhorse,\" said he, placing his hand upon the pommel of the saddle, and\nlooking up in my face, \"and I think I can find you a customer.  If you\nwould take a hundred, I think my lord would purchase it, for he has sent\nme about the fair to look him up a horse, by which he could hope to make\nan honest penny.\"  \"Well,\" said I, \"and could he not make an honest\npenny, and yet give me the price I ask?\"  \"Why,\" said the go-between, \"a\nhundred and fifty pounds is as much as the animal is worth, or nearly so;\nand my lord, do you see--\"  \"I see no reason at all,\" said I, \"why I\nshould sell the animal for less than he is worth, in order that his\nlordship may be benefited by him; so that if his lordship wants to make\nan honest penny, he must find some person who would consider the\ndisadvantage of selling him a horse for less than it is worth, as\ncounterbalanced by the honour of dealing with a lord, which I should\nnever do; but I can't be wasting my time here.  I am going back to the ---\n, where, if you, or any person, are desirous of purchasing the horse, you\nmust come within the next half hour, or I shall probably not feel\ndisposed to sell him at all.\"  \"Another word, young man,\" said the\njockey; but without staying to hear what he had to say, I put the horse\nto his best trot, and re-entering the town, and threading my way as well\nas I could through the press, I returned to the yard of the inn, where,\ndismounting, I stood still, holding the horse by the bridle.\n\nI had been standing in this manner about five minutes, when I saw the\njockey enter the yard, accompanied by another individual.  They advanced\ndirectly towards me.  \"Here is my lord come to look at the horse, young\nman,\" said the jockey.  My lord, as the jockey called him, was a tall\nfigure, of about five-and-thirty.  He had on his head a hat somewhat\nrusty, and on his back a surtout of blue rather the worse for wear.  His\nforehead, if not high, was exceedingly narrow; his eyes were brown, with\na rat-like glare in them; the nose was rather long, and the mouth very\nwide; the cheek-bones high, and the cheeks, as to hue and consistency,\nexhibiting very much the appearance of a withered red apple; there was a\ngaunt expression of hunger in the whole countenance.  He had scarcely\nglanced at the horse, when drawing in his cheeks, he thrust out his lips\nvery much after the manner of a baboon, when he sees a piece of sugar\nheld out towards him.  \"Is this horse yours?\" said he, suddenly turning\ntowards me, with a kind of smirk.  \"It's my horse,\" said I; \"are you the\nperson who wishes to make an honest penny by it?\"  \"How!\" said he,\ndrawing up his head with a very consequential look, and speaking with a\nvery haughty tone, \"what do you mean?\"  We looked at each other full in\nthe face; after a few moments, the muscles of the mouth of him of the\nhungry look began to move violently, the face was puckered into\ninnumerable wrinkles, and the eyes became half closed.  \"Well,\" said I,\n\"have you ever seen me before?  I suppose you are asking yourself that\nquestion.\"  \"Excuse me, sir,\" said he, dropping his lofty look, and\nspeaking in a very subdued and civil tone, \"I have never had the honour\nof seeing you before, that is\"--said he, slightly glancing at me again,\nand again moving the muscles of his mouth, \"no, I have never seen you\nbefore,\" he added, making me a bow.  \"I have never had that pleasure; my\nbusiness with you, at present, is to inquire the lowest price you are\nwilling to take for this horse.  My agent here informs me that you ask\none hundred and fifty pounds, which I cannot think of giving--the horse\nis a showy horse, but look, my dear sir, he has a defect here, and there\nin his near fore leg I observe something which looks very like a\nsplint--yes, upon my credit,\" said he, touching the animal, \"he has a\nsplint, or something which will end in one.  A hundred and fifty pounds,\nsir! what could have induced you ever to ask anything like that for this\nanimal?  I protest that, in my time, I have frequently bought a better\nfor-- Who are you, sir?  I am in treaty for this horse,\" said he to a man\nwho had come up whilst he was talking, and was now looking into the\nhorse's mouth.  \"Who am I?\" said the man, still looking into the horse's\nmouth; \"who am I? his lordship asks me.  Ah, I see, close on five,\" said\nhe, releasing the horse's jaws, and looking at me.  This new comer was a\nthin, wiry-made individual, with wiry curling brown hair; his face was\ndark, and wore an arch and somewhat roguish expression; upon one of his\neyes was a kind of speck or beam; he might be about forty, wore a green\njockey coat, and held in his hand a black riding whip, with a knob of\nsilver wire.  As I gazed upon his countenance, it brought powerfully to\nmy mind the face which, by the light of the candle, I had seen staring\nover me on the preceding night, when lying in bed and half asleep.  Close\nbeside him, and seemingly in his company, stood an exceedingly tall\nfigure, that of a youth, seemingly about one-and-twenty, dressed in a\nhandsome riding dress, and wearing on his head a singular hat, green in\ncolour, and with a very high peak.  \"What do you ask for this horse?\"\nsaid he of the green coat, winking at me with the eye which had a beam in\nit, whilst the other shone and sparkled like Mrs. Colonel W-'s Golconda\ndiamond.  \"Who are you, sir, I demand once more?\" said he of the hungry\nlook.  \"Who am I? why, who should I be but Jack Dale, who buys horses for\nhimself and other folk; I want one at present for this short young\ngentleman,\" said he, motioning with his finger to the gigantic youth.\n\"Well, sir,\" said the other, \"and what business have you to interfere\nbetween me and any purchase I may be disposed to make?\"  \"Well, then,\"\nsaid the other, \"be quick and purchase the horse, or, perhaps, I may.\"\n\"Do you think I am to be dictated to by a fellow of your description?\"\nsaid his lordship, \"begone, or--\"  \"What do you ask for this horse?\" said\nthe other to me, very coolly.  \"A hundred and fifty,\" said I.  \"I\nshouldn't mind giving it to you,\" said he.  \"You will do no such thing,\"\nsaid his lordship, speaking so fast that he almost stuttered.  \"Sir,\"\nsaid he to me, \"I must give you what you ask; Symmonds, take possession\nof the animal for me,\" said he to the other jockey who attended him.  \"You\nwill please to do no such thing without my consent,\" said I, \"I have not\nsold him.\"  \"I have this moment told you that I will give you the price\nyou demand,\" said his lordship; \"is not that sufficient?\"  \"No,\" said I,\n\"there is a proper manner of doing everything--had you come forward in a\nmanly and gentlemanly manner to purchase the horse, I should have been\nhappy to sell him to you, but after all the fault you have found with\nhim, I would not sell him to you at any price, so send your friend to\nfind up another.\"  \"You behave in this manner, I suppose,\" said his\nlordship, \"because this fellow has expressed a willingness to come to\nyour terms.  I would advise you to be cautious how you trust the animal\nin his hands; I think I have seen him before, and could tell you--\"  \"What\ncan you tell of me?\" said the other, going up to him; \"except that I have\nbeen a poor dicky-boy, and that now I am a dealer in horses, and that my\nfather was lagged; that's all you could tell of me, and that I don't mind\ntelling myself: but there are two things they can't say of me, they can't\nsay that I am either a coward or a screw either, except so far as one who\ngets his bread by horses may be expected to be; and they can't say of me\nthat I ever ate up an ice which a young woman was waiting for, or that I\never backed out of a fight.  Horse!\" said he, motioning with his finger\ntauntingly to the other; \"what do you want with a horse, except to take\nthe bread out of the mouth of a poor man--to-morrow is not the battle of\nWaterloo, so that you don't want to back out of danger, by pretending to\nhave hurt yourself by falling from the creature's back, my lord of the\nwhite feather--come, none of your fierce looks--I am not afraid of you.\"\nIn fact, the other had assumed an expression of the deadliest malice, his\nteeth were clenched, his lips quivered, and were quite pale; the rat-like\neyes sparkled, and he made a half spring, a la rat, towards his\nadversary, who only laughed.  Restraining himself, however, he suddenly\nturned to his understrapper, saying, \"Symmonds, will you see me thus\ninsulted? go and trounce this scoundrel; you can, I know.\"  \"Symmonds\ntrounce me!\" said the other, going up to the person addressed, and\ndrawing his hand contemptuously over his face; \"why, I beat Symmonds in\nthis very yard in one round three years ago; didn't I, Symmonds?\" said he\nto the understrapper, who held down his head, muttering, in a surly tone,\n\"I didn't come here to fight; let every one take his own part.\"  \"That's\nright, Symmonds,\" said the other, \"especially every one from whom there\nis nothing to be got.  I would give you half-a-crown for all the trouble\nyou have had, provided I were not afraid that my Lord Plume there would\nget it from you as soon as you leave the yard together.  Come, take\nyourselves both off; there's nothing to be made here.\"  Indeed, his\nlordship seemed to be of the same opinion, for after a further glance at\nthe horse, a contemptuous look at me, and a scowl at the jockey, he\nturned on his heel, muttering something which sounded like fellows, and\nstalked out of the yard, followed by Symmonds.\n\n\"And now, young man,\" said the jockey, or whatever he was, turning to me\nwith an arch leer, \"I suppose I may consider myself as the purchaser of\nthis here animal, for the use and behoof of this young gentleman?\" making\na sign with his head to the tall young man by his side.  \"By no means,\"\nsaid I, \"I am utterly unacquainted with either of you, and before parting\nwith the horse I must be satisfied as to the respectability of the\npurchaser.\"  \"Oh! as to that matter,\" said he, \"I have plenty of vouchers\nfor my respectability about me;\" and thrusting his hand into his bosom\nbelow his waistcoat, he drew out a large bundle of notes.  \"These are the\nkind of things,\" said he, \"which vouch best for a man's respectability.\"\n\"Not always,\" said I; \"indeed, sometimes these kind of things need\nvouchers for themselves.\"  The man looked at me with a peculiar look.  \"Do\nyou mean to say that these notes are not sufficient notes?\" said he,\n\"because if you do I shall take the liberty of thinking you are not over\ncivil, and when I thinks a person is not over and above civil I sometimes\ntakes off my coat; and when my coat is off--\"  \"You sometimes knock\npeople down,\" I added; \"well, whether you knock me down or not, I beg\nleave to tell you that I am a stranger in this fair, and that I shall\npart with the horse to nobody who has no better guarantee for his\nrespectability than a roll of bank-notes, which may be good or not for\nwhat I know, who am not a judge of such things.\"  \"Oh! if you are a\nstranger here,\" said the man, \"as I believe you are, never having seen\nyou here before except last night, when I think I saw you above stairs by\nthe glimmer of a candle--I say, if you are a stranger, you are quite\nright to be cautious; queer things being done in this fair, as nobody\nknows better than myself,\" he added with a leer; \"but I suppose if the\nlandlord of the house vouches for me and my notes, you will have no\nobjection to part with the horse to me?\"  \"None whatever,\" said I, \"and\nin the meantime the horse can return to the stable.\"\n\nThereupon I delivered the horse to my friend the ostler.\n\nThe landlord of the house on being questioned by me as to the character\nand condition of my new acquaintance, informed me that he was a\nrespectable horsedealer, and an intimate friend of his, whereupon the\npurchase was soon brought to a satisfactory conclusion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\n\nHigh Dutch.\n\nIt was evening: and myself and the two acquaintances I had made in the\nfair--namely, the jockey and the tall foreigner--sat in a large upstairs\nroom, which looked into a court; we had dined with several people\nconnected with the fair at a long _table d'hote_; they had now departed,\nand we sat at a small side-table with wine and a candle before us; both\nmy companions had pipes in their mouths--the jockey a common pipe, and\nthe foreigner, one, the syphon of which, made of some kind of wood, was\nat least six feet long, and the bowl of which, made of a white kind of\nsubstance like porcelain, and capable of holding nearly an ounce of\ntobacco, rested on the ground.  The jockey frequently emptied and\nreplenished his glass; the foreigner sometimes raised his to his lips,\nfor no other purpose seemingly than to moisten them, as he never drained\nhis glass.  As for myself, though I did not smoke, I had a glass before\nme, from which I sometimes took a sip.  The room, notwithstanding the\nwindow was flung open, was in general so filled with smoke, chiefly that\nwhich was drawn from the huge bowl of the foreigner, that my companions\nand I were frequently concealed from each other's eyes.  The\nconversation, which related entirely to the events of the fair, was\ncarried on by the jockey and myself, the foreigner, who appeared to\nunderstand the greater part of what we said, occasionally putting in a\nfew observations in broken English.  At length the jockey, after the\nother had made some ineffectual attempts to express something\nintelligibly which he wished to say, observed, \"Isn't it a pity that so\nfine a fellow as meinheer, and so clever a fellow too, as I believe him\nto be, is not a better master of our language?\"\n\n\"Is the gentleman a German?\" said I; \"if so, I can interpret for him\nanything he wishes to say.\"\n\n\"The deuce you can,\" said the jockey, taking his pipe out of his mouth,\nand staring at me through the smoke.\n\n\"Ha! you speak German,\" vociferated the foreigner in that language.  \"By\nIsten, I am glad of it!  I wanted to say--\"  And here he said in German\nwhat he wished to say, and which was of no great importance, and which I\ntranslated into English.\n\n\"Well, if you don't put me out,\" said the jockey; \"what language is\nthat--Dutch?\"\n\n\"High Dutch,\" said I.\n\n\"High Dutch, and you speak High Dutch,--why, I had booked you for as\ngreat an ignoramus as myself, who can't write--no, nor distinguish in a\nbook a great A from a bull's foot.\"\n\n\"A person may be a very clever man,\" said I--\"no, not a clever man, for\nclever signifies clerkly, and a clever man one who is able to read and\nwrite, and entitled to the benefit of his clergy or clerkship; but a\nperson may be a very acute person without being able to read or write.  I\nnever saw a more acute countenance than your own.\"\n\n\"No soft soap,\" said the jockey, \"for I never uses any.  However, thank\nyou for your information; I have hitherto thought myself a'nition clever\nfellow, but from henceforth shall consider myself just the contrary, and\nonly--what's the word?--confounded 'cute.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said I.\n\n\"Well,\" said the jockey, \"as you say you can speak High Dutch, I should\nlike to hear you and master six foot six fire away at each other.\"\n\n\"I cannot speak German,\" said I, \"but I can understand tolerably well\nwhat others say in it.\"\n\n\"Come no backing out,\" said the jockey, \"let's hear you fire away for the\nglory of Old England.\"\n\n\"Then you are a German?\" said I, in German to the foreigner.\n\n\"That will do,\" said the jockey, \"keep it up.\"\n\n\"A German!\" said the tall foreigner.  \"No, I thank God that I do not\nbelong to the stupid sluggish Germanic race, but to a braver, taller, and\nhandsomer people;\" here taking the pipe out of his mouth, he stood up\nproudly erect, so that his head nearly touched the ceiling of the room,\nthen reseating himself, and again putting the syphon to his lips, he\nadded, \"I am a Magyar.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" said I.\n\nThe foreigner looked at me for a moment, somewhat contemptuously, through\nthe smoke, then said, in a voice of thunder, \"A Hungarian!\"\n\n\"What a voice the chap has when he pleases!\" interposed the jockey; \"what\nis he saying?\"\n\n\"Merely that he is a Hungarian,\" said I; but I added, \"the conversation\nof this gentleman and myself in a language which you can't understand\nmust be very tedious to you, we had better give it up.\"\n\n\"Keep on with it,\" said the jockey, \"I shall go on listening very\ncontentedly till I fall asleep, no bad thing to do at most times.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\n\nThe Hungarian.\n\n\"Then you are a countryman of Tekeli, and of the queen who made the\ncelebrated water,\" said I, speaking to the Hungarian in German, which I\nwas able to do tolerably well, owing to my having translated the\nPublisher's philosophy into that language, always provided I did not\nattempt to say much at a time.\n\n_Hungarian_.  Ah! you have heard of Tekeli, and of L'eau de la Reine\nd'Hongrie.  How is that?\n\n_Myself_.  I have seen a play acted, founded on the exploits of Tekeli,\nand have read Pigault Le Brun's beautiful romance, entitled the \"Barons\nof Felsheim,\" in which he is mentioned.  As for the water, I have heard a\nlady, the wife of a master of mine, speak of it.\n\n_Hungarian_.  Was she handsome?\n\n_Myself_.  Very.\n\n_Hungarian_.  Did she possess the water?\n\n_Myself_.  I should say not; for I have heard her express a great\ncuriosity about it.\n\n_Hungarian_.  Was she growing old?\n\n_Myself_.  Of course not; but why do you put all these questions?\n\n_Hungarian_.  Because the water is said to make people handsome, and\nabove all, to restore to the aged the beauty of their youth.  Well!\nTekeli was my countryman, and I have the honour of having some of the\nblood of the Tekelis in my veins, but with respect to the queen, pardon\nme if I tell you that she was not an Hungarian; she was a Pole--Ersebet\nby name, daughter of Wladislaus Locticus King of Poland; she was the\nfourth spouse of Caroly the Second, King of the Magyar country, who\nmarried her in 1320.  She was a great woman and celebrated politician,\nthough at present chiefly known by her water.\n\n_Myself_.  How came she to invent it?\n\n_Hungarian_.  If her own account may be believed, she did not invent it.\nAfter her death, as I have read in Florentius of Buda, there was found a\nstatement of the manner in which she came by it, written in her own hand,\non a fly-leaf of her breviary, to the following effect:--Being afflicted\nwith a grievous disorder at the age of seventy-two, she received the\nmedicine which was called her water, from an old hermit whom she never\nsaw before or afterwards; it not only cured her, but restored to her all\nher former beauty, so that the King of Poland fell in love with her, and\nmade her an offer of marriage, which she refused for the glory of God,\nfrom whose holy angel she believed she had received the water.  The\nreceipt for making it and directions for using it, were also found on the\nfly-leaf.  The principal component parts were burnt wine and rosemary,\npassed through an alembic; a drachm of it was to be taken once a week,\n\"etelbenn vagy italbann,\" in the food or the drink, early in the morning,\nand the cheeks were to be moistened with it every day.  The effects\naccording to the statement, were wonderful--and perhaps they were upon\nthe queen; but whether the water has been equally efficacious on other\npeople, is a point which I cannot determine.  I should wish to see some\nold woman who has been restored to youthful beauty by the use of L'eau de\nla Reine d'Hongrie.\n\n_Myself_.  Perhaps, if you did, the old gentlewoman would hardly be so\ningenuous as the queen.  But who are the Hungarians--descendants of\nAttila and his people?\n\nThe Hungarian shook his head, and gave me to understand that he did not\nbelieve that his nation were the descendants of Attila and his people,\nthough he acknowledged that they were probably of the same race.  Attila\nand his armies, he said, came and disappeared in a very mysterious\nmanner, and that nothing could be said with positiveness about them; that\nthe people now known as Magyars first made their appearance in Muscovy in\nthe year 884, under the leadership of Almus, called so from Alom, which,\nin the Hungarian language, signifies a dream; his mother, before his\nbirth, having dreamt that the child with which she was enceinte would be\nthe father of a long succession of kings, which, in fact, was the case;\nthat after beating the Russians he entered Hungary, and coming to a place\ncalled Ungvar, from which many people believed that modern Hungary\nderived its name, he captured it, and held in it a grand festival, which\nlasted four days, at the end of which time he resigned the leadership of\nthe Magyars to his son Arpad.  This Arpad and his Magyars utterly subdued\nPannonia--that is, Hungary and Transylvania, wresting the government of\nit from the Sclavonian tribes who inhabited it, and settling down amongst\nthem as conquerors!  After giving me this information, the Hungarian\nexclaimed with much animation,--\"A goodly country that which they had\nentered on, consisting of a plain surrounded by mountains, some of which\nintersect it here and there, with noble rapid rivers, the grandest of\nwhich is the mighty Dunau; a country with tiny volcanoes, casting up\npuffs of smoke and steam, and from which hot springs arise, good for the\nsick; with many fountains, some of which are so pleasant to the taste as\nto be preferred to wine; with a generous soil which, warmed by a\nbeautiful sun, is able to produce corn, grapes, and even the Indian weed;\nin fact, one of the finest countries in the world, which even a Spaniard\nwould pronounce to be nearly equal to Spain.  Here they\nrested--meditating, however, fresh conquests.  Oh, the Magyars soon\nshowed themselves a mighty people.  Besides Hungary and Transylvania,\nthey subdued Bulgaria and Bosnia, and the land of Tot, now called\nSclavonia.  The generals of Zoltan, the son of Arpad, led troops of\nhorsemen to the banks of the Rhine.  One of them, at the head of a host,\nbesieged Constantinople.  It was then that Botond engaged in combat with\na Greek of gigantic stature, who came out of the city and challenged the\ntwo best men in the Magyar army.  'I am the feeblest of the Magyars,'\nsaid Botond, 'but I will kill thee;' and he performed his word, having\npreviously given a proof of the feebleness of his arm by striking his\nbattle-axe through the brazen gate, making a hole so big that a child of\nfive years old could walk through it.\"\n\n_Myself_.  Of what religion were the old Hungarians?\n\n_Hungarian_.  They had some idea of a Supreme Being, whom they called\nIsten, which word is still used by the Magyars for God; but their chief\ndevotion was directed to sorcerers and soothsayers, something like the\nSchamans of the Siberian steppes.  They were converted to Christianity\nchiefly through the instrumentality of Istvan or Stephen, called after\nhis death St. Istvan, who ascended the throne in the year one thousand.\nHe was born in heathenesse, and his original name was Vojk: he was the\nfirst kiraly, or king of the Magyars.  Their former leaders had been\ncalled fejedelmek, or dukes.  The Magyar language has properly no term\neither for king or house.  Kiraly is a word derived from the Sclaves;\nhaz, or house, from the Germans, who first taught them to build houses,\ntheir original dwellings having been tilted waggons.\n\n_Myself_.  Many thanks for your account of the great men of your country.\n\n_Hungarian_.  The great men of my country!  I have only told you of the--\nWell, I acknowledge that Almus and Arpad were great men, but Hungary has\nproduced many greater; I will not trouble you by recapitulating all, but\nthere is one name I cannot forbear mentioning--but you have heard of\nit--even at Horncastle, the name of Hunyadi must be familiar.\n\n_Myself_.  It may be so, though I rather doubt it; but, however that may\nbe, I confess my ignorance.  I have never, until this moment, heard the\nname of Hunyadi.\n\n_Hungarian_.  Not of Hunyadi Janos, not of Hunyadi John--for the genius\nof our language compels us to put a man's Christian name after his other;\nperhaps you have heard of the name of Corvinus?\n\n_Myself_.  Yes, I have heard the name of Corvinus.\n\n_Hungarian_.  By my God, I am glad of it; I thought our hammer of\ndestruction, our thunderbolt, whom the Greeks called Achilles, must be\nknown to the people of Horncastle.  Well, Hunyadi and Corvinus are the\nsame.\n\n_Myself_.  Corvinus means the man of the crow, or raven.  I suppose that\nyour John, when a boy, climbed up to a crow or a raven's nest, and stole\nthe young; a bold feat, well befitting a young hero.\n\n_Hungarian_.  By Isten, you are an acute guesser; a robbery there was,\nbut it was not Hunyadi who robbed the raven, but the raven who robbed\nHunyadi.\n\n_Myself_.  How was that?\n\n_Hungarian_.  In this manner: Hunyadi, according to tradition, was the\nson of King Sigmond, by a peasant's daughter.  The king saw and fell in\nlove with her, whilst marching against the vaivode of Wallachia.  He had\nsome difficulty in persuading her to consent to his wishes, and she only\nyielded at last, on the king making her a solemn promise that, in the\nevent of her becoming with child by him, he would handsomely provide for\nher and the infant.  The king proceeded on his expedition; and on his\nreturning in triumph from Wallachia, again saw the girl, who informed him\nthat she was enceinte by him; the king was delighted with the\nintelligence, gave the girl money, and at the same time a ring,\nrequesting her, if she brought forth a son, to bring the ring to Buda\nwith the child, and present it to him.  When her time was up, the\npeasant's daughter brought forth a fair son, who was baptized by the name\nof John.  After some time the young woman communicated the whole affair\nto her elder brother, whose name was Gaspar, and begged him to convey her\nand the child to the king at Buda.  The brother consented, and both set\nout, taking the child with them.  On their way, the woman, wanting to\nwash her clothes, laid the child down, giving it the king's ring to play\nwith.  A raven, who saw the glittering ring, came flying, and plucking it\nout of the child's hand, carried it up into a tree; the child suddenly\nbegan to cry, and the mother, hearing it, left her washing, and running\nto the child, forthwith missed the ring, but hearing the raven croak in\nthe tree, she lifted up her eyes, and saw it with the ring in its beak.\nThe woman, in great terror, called her brother, and told him what had\nhappened, adding that she durst not approach the king if the raven took\naway the ring.  Gaspar, seizing his cross-bow and quiver, ran to the\ntree, where the raven was yet with the ring, and discharged an arrow at\nit, but, being in a great hurry, he missed it; with his second shot he\nwas more lucky, for he hit the raven in the breast, which, together with\nthe ring, fell to the ground.  Taking up the ring, they went on their\nway, and shortly arrived at Buda.  One day, as the king was walking after\ndinner in his outer hall, the woman appeared before him with the child,\nand, showing him the ring, said, \"Mighty lord! behold this token! and\ntake pity upon me and your own son.\"  King Sigmond took the child and\nkissed it, and, after a pause, said to the mother, \"You have done right\nin bringing me the boy; I will take care of you, and make him a\nnobleman.\"  The king was as good as his word, he provided for the mother;\ncaused the boy to be instructed in knightly exercises, and made him a\npresent of the town of Hunyad, in Transylvania, on which account he was\nafterwards called Hunyadi, and gave him, as an armorial sign, a raven\nbearing a ring in his beak.\n\nSuch, oh young man of Horncastle! is the popular account of the birth of\nthe great captain of Hungary, as related by Florentius of Buda.  There\nare other accounts of his birth, which is, indeed, involved in much\nmystery, and of the reason of his being called Corvinus, but as this is\nthe most pleasing, and is, upon the whole, founded on quite as good\nevidence as the others, I have selected it for recitation.\n\n_Myself_.  I heartily thank you; but you must tell me something more of\nHunyadi.  You call him your great captain; what did he do?\n\n_Hungarian_.  Do! what no other man of his day could have done.  He broke\nthe power of the Turk when he was coming to overwhelm Europe.  From the\nblows inflicted by Hunyadi, the Turk never thoroughly recovered; he has\nbeen frequently worsted in latter times, but none but Hunyadi could have\nrouted the armies of Amurath and Mahomed the Second.\n\n_Myself_.  How was it that he had an opportunity of displaying his\nmilitary genius?\n\n_Hungarian_.  I can hardly tell you, but his valour soon made him famous;\nKing Albert made him Ban of Szorenyi.  He became eventually waivode of\nTransylvania, and governor of Hungary.  His first grand action was the\ndefeat of Bashaw Isack; and though himself surprised and routed at St.\nImre, he speedily regained his prestige by defeating the Turks, with\nenormous slaughter, killing their leader, Mezerbeg; and subsequently, at\nthe battle of the Iron Gates, he destroyed ninety thousand Turks, sent by\nAmurath to avenge the late disgrace.  It was then that the Greeks called\nhim Achilles.\n\n_Myself_.  He was not always successful.\n\n_Hungarian_.  Who could be always successful against the early Turk?  He\nwas defeated in the battle in which King Vladislaus lost his life, but\nhis victories outnumbered his defeats three-fold.  His grandest\nvictory--perhaps the grandest ever achieved by man--was over the terrible\nMahomed the Second; who, after the taking of Constantinople in 1453,\nsaid, \"One God in Heaven--one king on earth;\" and marched to besiege\nBelgrade at the head of one hundred, and fifty thousand men; swearing by\nthe beard of the prophet, \"That he would sup within it ere two months\nwere elapsed.\"  He brought with him dogs, to eat the bodies of the\nChristians whom he should take or slay; so says Florentius; hear what he\nalso says: The Turk sat down before the town towards the end of June,\n1454, covering the Dunau and Szava with ships: and on the 4th of July he\nbegan to cannonade Belgrade with cannons twenty-five feet long, whose\nroar could be heard at Szeged, a distance of twenty-four leagues, at\nwhich place Hunyadi had assembled his forces.  Hunyadi had been able to\nraise only fifteen thousand of well-armed and disciplined men, though he\nhad with him vast bands of people, who called themselves Soldiers of the\nCross, but who consisted of inexperienced lads from school, peasants, and\nhermits, armed with swords, slings, and clubs.  Hunyadi, undismayed by\nthe great disparity between his forces and those of the Turk, advanced to\nrelieve Belgrade, and encamped at Szalankemen with his army.  There he\nsaw at once, that his first step must be to attack the flotilla; he\ntherefore privately informed Szilagy, his wife's brother, who at that\ntime defended Belgrade, that it was his intention to attack the ships of\nthe Turks on the 14th day of July in front, and requested his\nco-operation in the rear.  On the 14th came on the commencement of the\ngreat battle of Belgrade, between Hunyadi and the Turk.  Many days it\nlasted.\n\n_Myself_.  Describe it.\n\n_Hungarian_.  I cannot.  One has described it well--Florentius of Buda.  I\ncan only repeat a few of his words:--\"On the appointed day, Hunyadi, with\ntwo hundred vessels, attacked the Turkish flotilla in front, whilst\nSzilagy, with forty vessels, filled with the men of Belgrade, assailed it\nin the rear; striving for the same object, they sunk many of the Turkish\nvessels, captured seventy-four, burnt many, and utterly annihilated the\nwhole fleet.  After this victory, Hunyadi, with his army, entered\nBelgrade, to the great joy of the Magyars.  But though the force of\nMahomed upon the water was destroyed, that upon the land remained entire;\nand with this, during six days and nights, he attacked the city without\nintermission, destroying its walls in many parts.  His last and most\ndesperate assault was made on the 21st day of July.  Twice did the Turks\ngain possession of the outer town, and twice was it retaken with\nindescribable slaughter.  The next day the combat raged without ceasing\ntill mid-day, when the Turks were again beaten out of the town, and\npursued by the Magyars to their camp.  There the combat was renewed, both\nsides displaying the greatest obstinacy, until Mahomed received a great\nwound over his left eye.  The Turks then, turning their faces, fled,\nleaving behind them three hundred cannon in the hands of the Christians,\nand more than twenty-four thousand slain on the field of battle.\"\n\n_Myself_.  After that battle, I suppose Hunyadi enjoyed his triumphs in\npeace?\n\n_Hungarian_.  In the deepest, for he shortly died.  His great soul\nquitted his body, which was exhausted by almost superhuman exertions, on\nthe 11th of August, 1456.  Shortly before he died, according to\nFlorentius, a comet appeared, sent, as it would seem, to announce his\ncoming end.  The whole Christian world mourned his loss.  The Pope\nordered the cardinals to perform a funeral ceremony at Rome in his\nhonour.  His great enemy himself grieved for him, and pronounced his\nfinest eulogium.  When Mahomed the Second heard of his death, he struck\nhis head for some time against the ground without speaking.  Suddenly he\nbroke silence with these words, \"Notwithstanding he was my enemy, yet do\nI bewail his loss; since the sun has shone in heaven, no Prince had ever\nyet such a man.\"\n\n_Myself_.  What was the name of his Prince?\n\n_Hungarian_.  Laszlo the Fifth; who, though under infinite obligations to\nHunyadi, was anything but grateful to him; for he once consented to a\nplan which was laid to assassinate him, contrived by his mortal enemy\nUlrik, Count of Cilejia; and after Hunyadi's death, caused his eldest\nson, Hunyadi Laszlo, to be executed on a false accusation, and imprisoned\nhis younger son, Matyas, who, on the death of Laszlo, was elected by the\nMagyars to be their king, on the 24th of January, 1458.\n\n_Myself_.  Was this Matyas a good king?\n\n_Hungarian_.  Was Matyas Corvinus a good king?  O young man of\nHorncastle! he was the best and greatest that ever Hungary possessed,\nand, after his father, the most renowned warrior,--some of our best laws\nwere framed by him.  It was he who organized the Hussar force, and it was\nhe who took Vienna.  Why does your Government always send fools to\nrepresent it at Vienna?\n\n_Myself_.  I really cannot say; but with respect to the Hussar force, is\nit of Hungarian origin?\n\n_Hungarian_.  Its name shows its origin.  Huz, in Hungarian, is twenty\nand the Hussar force is so called because it is formed of twentieths.  A\nlaw was issued by which it was ordered that every Hungarian nobleman, out\nof every twenty dependents, should produce a well-equipped horseman, and\nwith him proceed to the field of battle.\n\n_Myself_.  Why did Matyas capture Venna?\n\n_Hungarian_.  Because the Emperor Frederick took part against him with\nthe King of Poland, who claimed the kingdom of Hungary for his son, and\nhad also assisted the Turk.  He captured it in the year 1487, but did not\nsurvive his triumph long, expiring there in the year 1490.  He was so\nveracious a man, that it was said of him, after his death, \"Truth died\nwith Matyas.\"  It might be added that the glory of Hungary departed with\nhim.  I wish to say nothing more connected with Hungarian history.\n\n_Myself_.  Another word.  Did Matyas leave a son?\n\n_Hungarian_.  A natural son, Hunyadi John, called so after the great man.\nHe would have been universally acknowledged as King of Hungary but for\nthe illegitimacy of his birth.  As it was, Ulaszlo, the son of the King\nof Poland, afterwards called Ulaszlo the Second, who claimed Hungary as\nbeing descended from Albert, was nominated king by a great majority of\nthe Magyar electors.  Hunyadi John for some time disputed the throne with\nhim; there was some bloodshed, but Hunyadi John eventually submitted, and\nbecame the faithful captain of Ulaszlo, notwithstanding that the Turk\noffered to assist him with an army of two hundred thousand men.\n\n_Myself_.  Go on.\n\n_Hungarian_.  To what?  Tche Drak, to the Mohacs Veszedelem.  Ulaszlo\nleft a son, Lajos the Second, born without skin, as it is said, certainly\nwithout a head.  He, contrary to the advice of all his wise\ncounsellors,--and amongst them was Batory Stephen, who became eventually\nKing of Poland--engaged, with twenty-five thousand men, at Mohacs,\nSoliman the Turk, who had an army of two hundred thousand.  Drak! the\nMagyars were annihilated, King Lajos disappeared with his heavy horse and\narmour in a bog.  We call that battle, which was fought on the 29th of\nAugust, 1526, the destruction of Mohacs, but it was the destruction of\nHungary.\n\n_Myself_.  You have twice used the word drak, what is the meaning of it?\nIs it Hungarian?\n\n_Hungarian_.  No! it belongs to the mad Wallacks.  They are a nation of\nmadmen on the other side of Transylvania.  Their country was formerly a\nfief of Hungary, like Moldavia, which is inhabited by the same race, who\nspeak the same language and are equally mad.\n\n_Myself_.  What language do they speak?\n\n_Hungarian_.  A strange mixture of Latin and Sclavonian--they themselves\nbeing a mixed race of Romans and Sclavonians.  Trajan sent certain\nlegions to form military colonies in Dacia; and the present Wallacks and\nMoldavians are, to a certain extent, the descendants of the Roman\nsoldiers, who married the women of the country.  I say to a certain\nextent, for the Sclavonian element both in blood and language seems to\nprevail.\n\n_Myself_.  And what is drak?\n\n_Hungarian_.  Dragon; which the Wallacks use for \"devil.\"  The term is\ncurious, as it shows that the old Romans looked upon the dragon as an\ninfernal being.\n\n_Myself_.  You have been in Wallachia?\n\n_Hungarian_.  I have, and glad I was to get out of it.  I hate the mad\nWallacks.\n\n_Myself_.  Why do you call them mad?\n\n_Hungarian_.  They are always drinking or talking.  I never saw a\nWallachian eating or silent.  They talk like madmen, and drink like\nmadmen.  In drinking they use small phials, the contents of which they\npour down their throats.  When I first went amongst them I thought the\nwhole nation was under a course of physic, but the terrible jabber of\ntheir tongues soon undeceived me.  Drak was the first word I heard on\nentering Dacia, and the last when I left it.  The Moldaves, if possible,\ndrink more, and talk more than the Wallachians.\n\n_Myself_.  It is singular enough that the only Moldavian I have known\ncould not speak.  I suppose he was born dumb.\n\n_Hungarian_.  A Moldavian born dumb!  Excuse me, the thing is\nimpossible,--all Moldavians are born talking!  I have known a Moldavian\nwho could not speak, but he was not born dumb.  His master, an Armenian,\nsnipped off part of his tongue at Adrianople.  He drove him mad with his\njabber.  He is now in London, where his master has a house.  I have\nletters of credit on the house: the clerk paid me money in London, the\nmaster was absent; the money which you received for the horse belonged to\nthat house.\n\n_Myself_.  Another word with respect to Hungarian history.\n\n_Hungarian_.  Drak!  I wish to say nothing more about Hungarian history.\n\n_Myself_.  The Turk, I suppose, after Mohacs, got possession of Hungary?\n\n_Hungarian_.  Not exactly.  The Turk, upon the whole, showed great\nmoderation; not so the Austrian.  Ferdinand the First claimed the crown\nof Hungary as being the cousin of Maria, widow of Lajos; he found too\nmany disposed to support him.  His claim, however, was resisted by\nZapolya John, a Hungarian magnate, who caused himself to be elected king.\nHungary was for a long time devastated by wars between the partisans of\nZapolya and Ferdinand.  At last Zapolya called in the Turk.  Soliman\nbehaved generously to him, and after his death befriended his young son,\nand Isabella his queen; eventually the Turks became masters of\nTransylvania and the greater part of Hungary.  They were not bad masters,\nand had many friends in Hungary, especially amongst those of the reformed\nfaith, to which I have myself the honour of belonging; those of the\nreformed faith found the Mufti more tolerant than the Pope.  Many\nHungarians went with the Turks to the siege of Vienna, whilst Tekeli and\nhis horsemen guarded Hungary for them.  A gallant enterprise that siege\nof Vienna, the last great effort of the Turk; it failed, and he speedily\nlost Hungary, but he did not sneak from Hungary like a frightened hound.\nHis defence of Buda will not be soon forgotten, where Apty Basha, the\ngovernor, died fighting like a lion in the breach.  There's many a\nHungarian would prefer Stamboul to Vienna.  Why does your Government\nalways send fools to represent it at Vienna?\n\n_Myself_.  I have already told you that I cannot say.  What became of\nTekeli?\n\n_Hungarian_.  When Hungary was lost he retired with the Turks into\nTurkey.  Count Renoncourt, in his Memoirs, mentions having seen him at\nAdrianople.  The Sultan, in consideration of the services which he had\nrendered to the Moslem in Hungary, made over the revenues of certain\ntowns and districts for his subsistence.  The count says that he always\nwent armed to the teeth, and was always attended by a young female\ndressed in male attire, who had followed him in his wars, and had more\nthan once saved his life.  His end is wrapped in mystery, I--whose\ngreatest boast, next to being a Hungarian, is to be of his blood--know\nnothing of his end.\n\n_Myself_.  Allow me to ask who you are?\n\n_Hungarian_.  Egy szegeny Magyar Nemes ember, a poor Hungarian nobleman,\nson of one yet poorer.  I was born in Transylvania, not far to the west\nof good Coloscvar.  I served some time in the Austrian army as a noble\nHussar, but am now equerry to a great nobleman, to whom I am distantly\nrelated.  In his service I have travelled far and wide, buying horses.  I\nhave been in Russia and in Turkey, and am now at Horncastle, where I have\nhad the satisfaction to meet with you, and to buy your horse, which is,\nin truth, a noble brute.\n\n_Myself_.  For a soldier and equerry you seem to know a great deal of the\nhistory of your country.\n\n_Hungarian_.  All I know is derived from Florentius of Buda, whom we call\nBudai Ferentz.  He was professor of Greek and Latin at the Reformed\nCollege of Debreczen, where I was educated; he wrote a work entitled\n\"Magyar Polgari Lexicon,\" Lives of Great Hungarian Citizens.  He was dead\nbefore I was born, but I found his book, when I was a child, in the\nsolitary home of my father, which stood on the confines of a puszta, or\nwilderness, and that book I used to devour in winter nights when the\nwinds were whistling around the house.  Oh! how my blood used to glow at\nthe descriptions of Magyar valour, and likewise of Turkish; for\nFlorentius has always done justice to the Turk.  Many a passage similar\nto this have I got by heart; it is connected with a battle on the plain\nof Rigo, which Hunyadi lost:--\"The next day, which was Friday, as the two\narmies were drawn up in battle array, a Magyar hero riding forth,\ngalloped up and down, challenging the Turks to single combat.  Then came\nout to meet him the son of a renowned bashaw of Asia; rushing upon each\nother, both broke their lances, but the Magyar hero and his horse rolled\nover upon the ground, for the Turks had always the best horses.\"  O young\nman of Horncastle! if ever you learn Hungarian--and learn it assuredly\nyou will after what I have told you--read the book of Florentius of Buda,\neven if you go to Hungary to get it, for you will scarcely find it\nelsewhere, and even there with difficulty, for the book has been long out\nof print.  It describes the actions of the great men of Hungary down to\nthe middle of the sixteenth century; and besides being written in the\npurest Hungarian, has the merit of having for its author a professor of\nthe Reformed College of Debreczen.\n\n_Myself_.  I will go to Hungary rather than not read it.  I am glad that\nthe Turk beat the Magyar.  When I used to read the ballads of Spain I\nalways sided with the Moor against the Christian.\n\n_Hungarian_.  It was a drawn fight after all, for the terrible horse of\nthe Turk presently flung his own master, whereupon the two champions\nreturned to their respective armies; but in the grand conflict which\nensued, the Turks beat the Magyars, pursuing them till night, and\nstriking them on the necks with their scymetars.  The Turk is a noble\nfellow; I should wish to be a Turk, were I not a Magyar.\n\n_Myself_.  The Turk always keeps his word, I am told.\n\n_Hungarian_.  Which the Christian very seldom does, and even the\nHungarian does not always.  In 1444 Ulaszlo made, at Szeged, peace with\nAmurath for ten years, which he swore with an oath to keep, but at the\ninstigation of the Pope Julian he broke it, and induced his great\ncaptain, Hunyadi John, to share in the perjury.  The consequence was the\nbattle of Varna, of the 10th of November, in which Hunyadi was routed,\nand Ulaszlo slain.  Did you ever hear his epitaph? it is both solemn and\nedifying:--\n\n   Romulidae Cannas ego Varnam clade notavi;\n   Discite mortales non temerare fidem:\n   Me nisi Pontifices jussissent rumpere foedus\n   Non ferret Scythicum Pannonis ora jugum.\"\n\n\"Halloo!\" said the jockey, starting up from a doze in which he had been\nindulging for the last hour, his head leaning upon his breast, \"what is\nthat?  That's not high Dutch; I bargained for high Dutch, and I left you\nspeaking high Dutch, as it sounded very much like the language of horses,\nas I have been told high Dutch does; but as for what you are speaking\nnow, whatever you may call it, it sounds more like the language of\nanother kind of animal.  I suppose you want to insult me, because I was\nonce a dicky-boy.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind,\" said I; \"the gentleman was making a quotation in\nLatin.\"\n\n\"Latin, was it?\" said the jockey; \"that alters the case.  Latin is\ngenteel, and I have sent my eldest boy to an academy to learn it.  Come,\nlet us hear you fire away in Latin,\" he continued, proceeding to re-light\nhis pipe, which, before going to sleep, he had laid on the table.\n\n\"If you wish to follow the discourse in Latin,\" said the Hungarian, in\nvery bad English, \"I can oblige you; I learned to speak very good Latin\nin the college of Debreczen.\"\n\n\"That's more,\" said I, \"than I have done in the colleges where I have\nbeen; in any little conversation which we may yet have, I wish you would\nuse German.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the jockey, taking a whiff, \"make your conversation as short\nas possible, whether in Latin or Dutch, for, to tell you the truth, I am\nrather tired of merely playing listener.\"\n\n\"You were saying you had been in Russia,\" said I; \"I believe the Russians\nare part of the Sclavonian race.\"\n\n_Hungarian_.  Yes, part of the great Sclavonian family; one of the most\nnumerous races in the world.  The Russians themselves are very numerous;\nwould that the Magyars could boast of the fifth part of their number!\n\n_Myself_.  What is the number of the Magyars?\n\n_Hungarian_.  Barely four millions.  We came a tribe of Tartars into\nEurope, and settled down amongst Sclavonians, whom we conquered, but who\nnever coalesced with us.  The Austrian at present plays in Pannonia the\nSclavonian against us, and us against the Sclavonian; but the downfall of\nthe Austrian is at hand; they, like us, are not a numerous people.\n\n_Myself_.  Who will bring about his downfall?\n\n_Hungarian_.  The Russians.  The Rysckie Tsar will lead his people forth,\nall the Sclavonians will join him, he will conquer all before him.\n\n_Myself_.  Are the Russians good soldiers?\n\n_Hungarian_.  They are stubborn and unflinching to an astonishing degree,\nand their fidelity to their Tsar is quite admirable.  See how the\nRussians behaved at Plescova, in Livonia, in the old time, against our\ngreat Batory Stephen; they defended the place till it was a heap of\nrubbish, and mark how they behaved after they had been made prisoners.\nStephen offered them two alternatives:--to enter into his service, in\nwhich they would have good pay, clothing, and fair treatment; or to be\nallowed to return to Russia.  Without the slightest hesitation they, to a\nman, chose the latter, though well aware that their beloved Tsar, the\ncruel Ivan Basilowits, would put them all to death, amidst tortures the\nmost horrible, for not doing what was impossible--preserving the town.\n\n_Myself_.  You speak Russian?\n\n_Hungarian_.  A little.  I was born in the vicinity of a Sclavonian\ntribe; the servants of our house were Sclavonians, and I early acquired\nsomething of their language, which differs not much from that of Russia;\nwhen in that country I quickly understood what was said.\n\n_Myself_.  Have the Russians any literature?\n\n_Hungarian_.  Doubtless; but I am not acquainted with it, as I do not\nread their language; but I know something of their popular tales, to\nwhich I used to listen in their izbushkas; a principal personage in these\nis a creation quite original--called Baba Yaga.\n\n_Myself_.  Who is the Baba Yaga?\n\n_Hungarian_.  A female phantom, who is described as hurrying along the\npuszta, or steppe, in a mortar, pounding with a pestle at a tremendous\nrate, and leaving a long trace on the ground behind her with her tongue,\nwhich is three yards long, and with which she seizes any men and horses\ncoming in her way, swallowing them down into her capacious belly.  She\nhas several daughters, very handsome, and with plenty of money; happy the\nyoung Mujik who catches and marries one of them, for they make excellent\nwives.\n\n\"Many thanks,\" said I, \"for the information you have afforded me: this is\nrather poor wine,\" I observed, as I poured out a glass--\"I suppose you\nhave better wine in Hungary?\"\n\n\"Yes, we have better wine in Hungary.  First of all there is Tokay, the\nmost celebrated in the world, though I confess I prefer the wine of\nEger--Tokay is too sweet.\"\n\n\"Have you ever been at Tokay?\"\n\n\"I have,\" said the Hungarian.\n\n\"What kind of place is Tokay?\"\n\n\"A small town situated on the Tyzza, a rapid river descending from the\nnorth; the Tokay Mountain is just behind the town, which stands on the\nright bank.  The top of the mountain is called Kopacs Teto, or the bald\ntip; the hill is so steep that during thunder-storms pieces frequently\nfall down upon the roofs of the houses.  It was planted with vines by\nKing Lajos, who ascended the throne in 1342.  The best wine called Tokay\nis, however, not made at Tokay, but at Kassau, two leagues farther into\nthe Carpathians, of which Tokay is a spur.  If you wish to drink the best\nTokay, you must go to Vienna, to which place all the prime is sent.  For\nthe third time I ask you, O young man of Horncastle! why does your\nGovernment always send fools to represent it at Vienna?\"\n\n\"And for the third time I tell you, O son of Almus! that I cannot say;\nperhaps, however, to drink the sweet Tokay wine; fools, you know, always\nlike sweet things.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said the Hungarian; \"it must be so, and when I return to Hungary,\nI will state to my countrymen your explanation of a circumstance which\nhas frequently caused them great perplexity.  Oh! the English are a\nclever people, and have a deep meaning in all they do.  What a vision of\ndeep policy opens itself to my view! they do not send their fool to\nVienna in order to gape at processions, and to bow and scrape at a base\nPapist court, but to drink at the great dinners the celebrated Tokay of\nHungary, which the Hungarians, though they do not drink it, are very\nproud of, and by doing so to intimate the sympathy which the English\nentertain for their fellow religionists of Hungary.  Oh! the English are\na deep people.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\n\nThe Horncastle Welcome--Tzernebock and Bielebock.\n\nThe pipe of the Hungarian had, for some time past, exhibited considerable\nsymptoms of exhaustion, little or no ruttling having been heard in the\ntube, and scarcely a particle of smoke, drawn through the syphon, having\nbeen emitted from the lips of the possessor.  He now rose from his seat,\nand going to a corner of the room, placed his pipe against the wall, then\nstriding up and down the room, he cracked his fingers several times,\nexclaiming, in a half-musing manner, \"Oh, the deep nation, which, in\norder to display its sympathy for Hungary, sends its fool to Vienna, to\ndrink the sweet wine of Tokay!\"\n\nThe jockey, having looked for some time at the tall figure with evident\napprobation, winked at me with that brilliant eye of his on which there\nwas no speck, saying, \"'Did you ever see a taller fellow?\"\n\n\"Never,\" said I.\n\n\"Or a finer?\"\n\n\"That's another question,\" said I, \"which I am not so willing to answer;\nhowever, as I am fond of truth, and scorn to flatter, I will take the\nliberty of saying that I have seen a finer.\"\n\n\"A finer! where?\" said the jockey; whilst the Hungarian, who appeared to\nunderstand what we said, stood still, and looked full at me.\n\n\"Amongst a strange set of people,\" said I, \"whom, if I were to name, you\nwould, I dare say, only laugh at me.\"\n\n\"Who be they?\" said the jockey.  \"Come, don't be ashamed; I have\noccasionally kept queerish company myself.\"\n\n\"The people whom we call gypsies,\" said I; \"whom the Germans call\nZigeuner, and who call themselves Romany chals.\"\n\n\"Zigeuner!\" said the Hungarian; \"by Isten!  I do know those people.\"\n\n\"Romany chals!\" said the jockey; \"whew!  I begin to smell a rat.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by smelling a rat?\" said I.\n\n\"I'll bet a crown,\" said the jockey, \"that you be the young chap what\ncertain folks call 'the Romany Rye.'\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said I, \"how came you to know that name?\"\n\n\"Be not you he?\" said the jockey.\n\n\"Why, I certainly have been called by that name.\"\n\n\"I could have sworn it,\" said the jockey; then rising from his chair, he\nlaid his pipe on the table, took a large hand-bell which stood on the\nside-board, and going to the door, opened it, and commenced ringing in a\nmost tremendous manner on the staircase.  The noise presently brought up\na waiter, to whom the jockey vociferated, \"Go to your master, and tell\nhim to send immediately three bottles of champagne, of the pink kind,\nmind you, which is twelve guineas a dozen;\" the waiter hurried away, and\nthe jockey resumed his seat and his pipe.  I sat in silent astonishment\nuntil the waiter returned with a basket containing the wine, which, with\nthree long glasses, he placed on the table.  The jockey then got up, and\ngoing to a large bow-window at the end of the room, which looked into a\ncourt-yard, peeped out; then saying, \"the coast is clear,\" he shut down\nthe principal sash which was open for the sake of the air, and taking up\na bottle of champagne, he placed another in the hands of the Hungarian,\nto whom he said something in private.  The latter, who seemed to\nunderstand him, answered by a nod.  The two then going to the end of the\ntable fronting the window, and about eight paces from it, stood before\nit, holding the bottles by their necks; suddenly the jockey lifted up his\narm.  \"Surely,\" said I, \"you are not mad enough to fling that bottle\nthrough the window?\"  \"Here's to the Romany Rye; here's to the sweet\nmaster,\" said the jockey, dashing the bottle through the pane in so neat\na manner that scarcely a particle of glass fell into the room.\n\n\"Eljen edes csigany ur--eljen gul eray!\" said the Hungarian, swinging\nround his bottle, and discharging it at the window; but, either not\npossessing the jockey's accuracy of aim, or reckless of the consequences,\nhe flung his bottle so, that it struck against part of the wooden setting\nof the panes, breaking along with the wood and itself three or four panes\nto pieces.  The crash was horrid, and wine and particles of glass flew\nback into the room, to the no small danger of its inmates.  \"What do you\nthink of that?\" said the jockey; \"were you ever so honoured before?\"\n\"Honoured!\" said I.  \"God preserve me in future from such honour;\" and I\nput my finger to my cheek, which was slightly hurt by a particle of the\nglass.  \"That's the way we of the cofrady honour great men at\nHorncastle,\" said the jockey.  \"What, you are hurt! never mind; all the\nbetter; your scratch shows that you are the body the compliment was paid\nto.\"  \"And what are you going to do with the other bottle?\" said I.  \"Do\nwith it!\" said the jockey, \"why, drink it, cosily and comfortably, whilst\nholding a little quiet talk.  The Romany Rye at Horncastle, what an\nidea!\"\n\n\"And what will the master of the house say to all this damage which you\nhave caused him!\"\n\n\"What will your master say, William?\" said the jockey to the waiter, who\nhad witnessed the singular scene just described without exhibiting the\nslightest mark of surprise.  William smiled, and slightly shrugging his\nshoulders, replied, \"Very little, I dare say, sir; this a'n't the first\ntime your honour has done a thing of this kind.\"  \"Nor will it be the\nfirst time that I shall have paid for it,\" said the jockey; \"well, I\nshall never have paid for a certain item in the bill with more pleasure\nthan I shall pay for it now.  Come, William, draw the cork, and let us\ntaste the pink champagne.\"\n\nThe waiter drew the cork, and filled the glasses with a pinky liquor,\nwhich bubbled, hissed, and foamed.  \"How do you like it?\" said the\njockey, after I had imitated the example of my companions, by despatching\nmy portion at a draught.\n\n\"It is wonderful wine,\" said I; \"I have never tasted champagne before,\nthough I have frequently heard it praised; it more than answers my\nexpectations; but, I confess, I should not wish to be obliged to drink it\nevery day.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" said the jockey, \"for every-day drinking give me a glass of old\nport, or--\"\n\n\"Of hard old ale,\" I interposed, \"which, according to my mind, is better\nthan all the wine in the world.\"\n\n\"Well said, Romany Rye,\" said the jockey, \"just my own opinion; now,\nWilliam, make yourself scarce.\"\n\nThe waiter withdrew, and I said to the jockey, \"How did you become\nacquainted with the Romany chals?\"\n\n\"I first became acquainted with them,\" said the jockey, \"when I lived\nwith old Fulcher the basketmaker, who took me up when I was adrift upon\nthe world; I do not mean the present Fulcher, who is likewise called old\nFulcher, but his father, who has been dead this many a year; while living\nwith him in the caravan, I frequently met them in the green lanes, and of\nlatter years I have had occasional dealings with them in the horse line.\"\n\n\"And the gypsies have mentioned me to you?\" said I.\n\n\"Frequently,\" said the jockey, \"and not only those of these parts; why,\nthere's scarcely a part of England in which I have not heard the name of\nthe Romany Rye mentioned by these people.  The power you have over them\nis wonderful; that is, I should have thought it wonderful, had they not\nmore than once told me the cause.\"\n\n\"And what is the cause?\" said I, \"for I am sure I do not know.\"\n\n\"The cause is this,\" said the jockey, \"they never heard a bad word\nproceed from your mouth, and never knew you do a bad thing.\"\n\n\"They are a singular people,\" said I.\n\n\"And what a singular language they have got,\" said the jockey.\n\n\"Do you know it?\" said I.\n\n\"Only a few words,\" said the jockey, \"they were always chary in teaching\nme any.\"\n\n\"They were vary sherry to me too,\" said the Hungarian, speaking in broken\nEnglish; \"I only could learn from them half-a-dozen words, for example,\ngul eray, which, in the czigany of my country, means sweet gentleman; or\nedes ur in my own Magyar.\"\n\n\"Gudlo Rye, in the Romany of mine, means a sugar'd gentleman,\" said I;\n\"then there are gypsies in your country?\"\n\n\"Plenty,\" said the Hungarian, speaking German, \"and in Russia and Turkey\ntoo; and wherever they are found, they are alike in their ways and\nlanguage.  Oh, they are a strange race, and how little known!  I know\nlittle of them, but enough to say, that one horse-load of nonsense has\nbeen written about them; there is one Valter Scott--\"\n\n\"Mind what you say about him,\" said I; \"he is our grand authority in\nmatters of philology and history.\"\n\n\"A pretty philologist,\" said the Hungarian, \"who makes the gypsies speak\nRoth-Welsch, the dialect of thieves; a pretty historian, who couples\ntogether Thor and Tzernebock.\"\n\n\"Where does he do that?\" said I.\n\n\"In his conceited romance of 'Ivanhoe,' he couples Thor and Tzernebock\ntogether, and calls them gods of the heathen Saxons.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"Thur or Thor was certainly a god of the heathen Saxons.\"\n\n\"True,\" said the Hungarian; \"but why couple him with Tzernebock?\nTzernebock was a word which your Valter had picked up somewhere without\nknowing the meaning.  Tzernebock was no god of the Saxons, but one of the\ngods of the Sclaves, on the southern side of the Baltic.  The Sclaves had\ntwo grand gods to whom they sacrificed, Tzernebock and Bielebock; that\nis, the black and white gods, who represented the powers of dark and\nlight.  They were overturned by Waldemar, the Dane, the great enemy of\nthe Sclaves; the account of whose wars you will find in one fine old\nbook, written by Saxo Gramaticus, which I read in the library of the\ncollege of Debreczen.  The Sclaves, at one time, were masters of all the\nsouthern shore of the Baltic, where their descendants are still to be\nfound, though they have lost their language, and call themselves Germans;\nbut the word Zernevitz near Dantzic, still attests that the Sclavic\nlanguage was once common in those parts.  Zernevitz means the thing of\nblackness, as Tzernebock means the god of blackness.  Prussia itself\nmerely means, in Sclavish, Lower Russia.  There is scarcely a race or\nlanguage in the world more extended than the Sclavic.  On the other side\nof the Dunau you will find the Sclaves and their language.  Czernavoda is\nSclavic, and means black water; in Turkish, kara su; even as Tzernebock\nmeans black god; and Belgrade, or Belograd, means the white town; even as\nBielebock, or Bielebog, means the white god.  Oh! he is one great\nignorant, that Valter.  He is going, they say, to write one history about\nNapoleon.  I do hope that in his history he will couple his Thor and\nTzernebock together.  By my God! it would be good diversion that.\"\n\n\"Walter Scott appears to be no particular favourite of yours,\" said I.\n\n\"He is not,\" said the Hungarian; \"I hate him for his slavish principles.\nHe wishes to see absolute power restored in this country, and Popery\nalso--and I hate him because--what do you think?  In one of his novels,\npublished a few months ago, he has the insolence to insult Hungary in the\npresence of one of her sons.  He makes his great braggart, Coeur de Lion,\nfling a Magyar over his head.  Ha! it was well for Richard that he never\nfelt the gripe of a Hungarian.  I wish the braggart could have felt the\ngripe of me, who am 'a' magyarok kozt legkissebb,' the least among the\nMagyars.  I do hate that Scott, and all his vile gang of Lowlanders and\nHighlanders.  The black corps, the fekete regiment of Matyjas Hunyadi,\nwas worth all the Scots, high or low, that ever pretended to be soldiers;\nand would have sent them all headlong into the Black Sea, had they dared\nto confront it on its shores; but why be angry with an ignorant, who\ncouples together Thor and Tzernebock?  Ha! Ha!\"\n\n\"You have read his novels?\" said I.\n\n\"Yes, I read them now and then.  I do not speak much English, but I can\nread it well, and I have read some of his romances, and mean to read his\n'Napoleon,' in the hope of finding Thor and Tzernebock coupled together\nin it, as in his high-flying 'Ivanhoe.'\"\n\n\"Come,\" said the jockey, \"no more Dutch, whether high or low.  I am tired\nof it; unless we can have some English, I am off to bed.\"\n\n\"I should be very glad to hear some English,\" said I; \"especially from\nyour mouth.  Several things which you have mentioned, have awakened my\ncuriosity.  Suppose you give us your history?\"\n\n\"My history?\" said the jockey.  \"A rum idea! however, lest conversation\nshould lag, I'll give it you.  First of all, however, a glass of\nchampagne to each.\"\n\nAfter we had each taken a glass of champagne, the jockey commenced his\nhistory.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\n\nThe Jockey's Tale--Thieves' Latin--Liberties with Coin--The Smasher in\nPrison--Old Fulcher--Every One has His Gift--Fashion of the English.\n\n\"My grandfather was a shorter, and my father was a smasher; the one was\nscragg'd, and the other lagg'd.\"\n\nI here interrupted the jockey by observing that his discourse was, for\nthe greater part, unintelligible to me.\n\n\"I do not understand much English,\" said the Hungarian, who, having\nreplenished and resumed his mighty pipe, was now smoking away; \"but, by\nIsten, I believe it is the gibberish which that great ignorant Valther\nScott puts into the mouths of the folks he calls gypsies.\"\n\n\"Something like it, I confess,\" said I, \"though this sounds more genuine\nthan his dialect, which he picked up out of the canting vocabulary at the\nend of the 'English Rogue,' a book which, however despised, was written\nby a remarkable genius.  What do you call the speech you were using?\"\nsaid I, addressing myself to the jockey.\n\n\"Latin,\" said the jockey, very coolly, \"that is, that dialect of it which\nis used by the light-fingered gentry.\"\n\n\"He is right,\" said the Hungarian; \"it is what the Germans call\nRoth-Welsch: they call it so because there are a great many Latin words\nin it, introduced by the priests, who, at the time of the Reformation,\nbeing too lazy to work and too stupid to preach, joined the bands of\nthieves and robbers who prowled about the country.  Italy, as you are\naware, is called by the Germans Welschland, or the land of the Welschers;\nand I may add that Wallachia derives its name from a colony of Welschers\nwhich Trajan sent there.  Welsch and Wallack being one and the same word,\nand tantamount to Latin.\"\n\n\"I dare say you are right,\" said I; \"but why was Italy termed\nWelschland?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said the Hungarian.\n\n\"Then I think I can tell you,\" said I; \"it was called so because the\noriginal inhabitants were a Cimbric tribe, who were called Gwyltiad, that\nis, a race of wild people, living in coverts, who were of the same blood,\nand spoke the same language as the present inhabitants of Wales.  Welsh\nseems merely a modification of Gwyltiad.  Pray continue your history,\"\nsaid I to the jockey, \"only please to do so in a language which we can\nunderstand, and first of all interpret the sentence with which you began\nit.\"\n\n\"I told you that my grandfather was a shorter,\" said the jockey, \"by\nwhich is meant a gentleman who shortens or reduces the current coin of\nthese realms, for which practice he was scragged, that is, hung by the\nscrag of the neck.  And when I said that my father was a smasher, I meant\none who passes forged notes, thereby doing his best to smash the Bank of\nEngland; by being lagged, I meant he was laid fast, that is, had a chain\nput round his leg and then transported.\"\n\n\"Your explanations are quite satisfactory,\" said I; \"the three first\nwords are metaphorical, and the fourth, lagged, is the old genuine Norse\nterm, lagda, which signifies laid, whether in durance, or in bed, has\nnothing to do with the matter.  What you have told me confirms me in an\nopinion which I have long entertained, that thieves' Latin is a strange\nmysterious speech, formed of metaphorical terms, and words derived from\nthe various ancient languages.  Pray tell me, now, how the gentleman,\nyour grandfather, contrived to shorten the coin of these realms?\"\n\n\"You shall hear,\" said the jockey; \"but I have one thing to beg of you,\nwhich is, that when I have once begun my history you will not interrupt\nme with questions, I don't like them, they stops one, and puts one out of\none's tale, and are not wanted; for anything which I think can't be\nunderstood, I should myself explain, without being asked.  My grandfather\nreduced or shortened the coin of this country by three processes.  By\naquafortis, by clipping, and by filing.  Filing and clipping he employed\nin reducing all sorts of coin, whether gold or silver; but aquafortis he\nused merely in reducing gold coin, whether guineas, jacobuses, or\nPortugal pieces, otherwise called moidores, which were at one time as\ncurrent as guineas.  By laying a guinea in aquafortis for twelve hours,\nhe could filch from it to the value of ninepence, and by letting it\nremain there for twenty-four to the value of eighteenpence, the\naquafortis eating the gold away, and leaving it like a sediment in the\nvessel.  He was generally satisfied with taking the value of ninepence\nfrom a guinea, of eighteenpence from a jacobus or moidore, or\nhalf-a-crown from a broad Spanish piece, whether he reduced them by\naquafortis, filing, or clipping.  From a five-shilling piece, which is\ncalled a bull in Latin because it is round like a bull's head, he would\nfile or clip to the value of fivepence, and from lesser coin in\nproportion.  He was connected with a numerous gang, or set, of people,\nwho had given up their minds and talents entirely to shortening.\"\n\nHere I interrupted the jockey.  \"How singular,\" said I, \"is the fall and\ndebasement of words; you talk of a gang, or set, of shorters; you are,\nperhaps, not aware that gang and set were, a thousand years ago, only\nconnected with the great and Divine; they are ancient Norse words, which\nmay be found in the heroic poems of the north, and in the Edda, a\ncollection of mythologic and heroic songs.  In these poems we read that\nsuch and such a king invaded Norway with a gang of heroes; or so and so,\nfor example, Erik Bloodaxe, was admitted to the set of gods; but at\npresent gang and set are merely applied to the vilest of the vile, and\nthe lowest of the low,--we say a gang of thieves and shorters, or a set\nof authors.  How touching is this debasement of words in the course of\ntime; it puts me in mind of the decay of old houses and names.  I have\nknown a Mortimer who was a hedger and ditcher, a Berners who was born in\na workhouse, and a descendant of the De Burghs, who bore the falcon,\nmending old kettles, and making horse and pony shoes in a dingle.\"\n\n\"Odd enough,\" said the jockey; \"but you were saying you knew one\nBerners--man or woman?  I would ask.\"\n\n\"A woman,\" said I.\n\n\"What might her Christian name be?\" said the jockey.\n\n\"It is not to be mentioned lightly,\" said I, with a sigh.\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder if it were Isopel,\" said the jockey with an arch\nglance of his one brilliant eye.\n\n\"It was Isopel,\" said I; \"did you know Isopel Berners?\"\n\n\"Ay, and have reason to know her,\" said the jockey, putting his hand into\nhis left waistcoat pocket, as if to feel for something, \"for she gave me\nwhat I believe few men could do--a most confounded whopping.  But now,\nMr. Romany Rye, I have again to tell you that I don't like to be\ninterrupted when I'm speaking, and to add that if you break in upon me a\nthird time, you and I shall quarrel.\"\n\n\"Pray proceed with your story,\" said I; \"I will not interrupt you again.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said the jockey.  \"Where was I?  Oh, with a set of people who had\ngiven up their minds to shortening!  Reducing the coin, though rather a\nlucrative, was a very dangerous trade.  Coin filed felt rough to the\ntouch; coin clipped could be easily detected by the eye; and as for coin\nreduced by aquafortis, it was generally so discoloured that, unless a\ngreat deal of pains was used to polish it, people were apt to stare at it\nin a strange manner, and to say, 'What have they been doing to this here\ngold?'  My grandfather, as I have said before, was connected with a gang\nof shorters, and sometimes shortened money, and at other times passed off\nwhat had been shortened by other gentry.\n\n\"Passing off what had been shortened by others was his ruin; for once, in\ntrying to pass off a broad piece which had been laid in aquafortis for\nfour-and-twenty hours, and was very black, not having been properly\nrectified, he was stopped and searched, and other reduced coins being\nfound about him, and in his lodgings, he was committed to prison, tried,\nand executed.  He was offered his life, provided he would betray his\ncomrades; but he told the big-wigs, who wanted him to do so, that he\nwould see them farther first, and died at Tyburn, amidst the cheers of\nthe populace, leaving my grandmother and father, to whom he had always\nbeen a kind husband and parent--for, setting aside the crime for which he\nsuffered, he was a moral man; leaving them, I say, to bewail his\nirreparable loss.\n\n\"'Tis said that misfortune never comes alone; this is, however, not\nalways the case.  Shortly after my grandfather's misfortune, as my\ngrandmother and her son were living in great misery in Spitalfields, her\nonly relation--a brother from whom she had been estranged some years, on\naccount of her marriage with my grandfather, who had been in an inferior\nstation to herself--died, leaving all his property to her and the child.\nThis property consisted of a farm of about a hundred acres, with its\nstock, and some money besides.  My grandmother, who knew something of\nbusiness, instantly went into the country, where she farmed the property\nfor her own benefit and that of her son, to whom she gave an education\nsuitable to a person in his condition, till he was old enough to manage\nthe farm himself.  Shortly after the young man came of age, my\ngrandmother died, and my father, in about a year, married the daughter of\na farmer, from whom he expected some little fortune, but who very much\ndeceived him, becoming a bankrupt almost immediately after the marriage\nof his daughter, and himself and family going into the workhouse.\n\n\"My mother, however, made my father an excellent wife; and if my father\nin the long run did not do well it was no fault of hers.  My father was\nnot a bad man by nature, he was of an easy, generous temper, the most\nunfortunate temper, by the bye, for success in this life that any person\ncan be possessed of, as those who have it are almost sure to be made\ndupes of by the designing.  But, though easy and generous, he was\nanything but a fool; he had a quick and witty tongue of his own when he\nchose to exert it, and woe be to those who insulted him openly, for there\nwas not a better boxer in the whole country round.  My parents were\nmarried several years before I came into the world, who was their first\nand only child.  I may be called an unfortunate creature; I was born with\nthis beam or scale on my left eye, which does not allow me to see with\nit; and though I can see tolerably sharply with the other, indeed more\nthan most people can with both of theirs, it is a great misfortune not to\nhave two eyes like other people.  Moreover, setting aside the affair of\nmy eye, I had a very ugly countenance; my mouth being slightly wrung\naside, and my complexion swarthy.  In fact, I looked so queer that the\ngossips and neighbours, when they first saw me, swore I was a\nchangeling--perhaps it would have been well if I had never been born; for\nmy poor father, who had been particularly anxious to have a son, no\nsooner saw me than he turned away, went to the neighbouring town, and did\nnot return for two days.  I am by no means certain that I was not the\ncause of his ruin, for till I came into the world he was fond of his\nhome, and attended much to business, but afterwards he went frequently\ninto company, and did not seem to care much about his affairs: he was,\nhowever, a kind man, and when his wife gave him advice never struck her,\nnor do I ever remember that he kicked me when I came in his way, or so\nmuch as cursed my ugly face, though it was easy to see that he didn't\nover-like me.  When I was six years old I was sent to the village-school,\nwhere I was soon booked for a dunce, because the master found it\nimpossible to teach me either to read or write.  Before I had been at\nschool two years, however, I had beaten boys four years older than\nmyself, and could fling a stone with my left hand (for if I am right-eyed\nI am left-handed) higher and farther than any one in the parish.\nMoreover, no boy could equal me at riding, and no people ride so well or\ndesperately as boys.  I could ride a donkey--a thing far more difficult\nto ride than a horse--at full gallop over hedges and ditches, seated, or\nrather floating upon his hinder part,--so, though anything but clever, as\nthis here Romany Rye would say, I was yet able to do things which few\nother people could do.  By the time I was ten my father's affairs had got\ninto a very desperate condition, for he had taken to gambling and horse-\nracing, and, being unsuccessful, had sold his stock, mortgaged his\nestate, and incurred very serious debts.  The upshot was, that within a\nlittle time all he had was seized, himself imprisoned, and my mother and\nmyself put into a cottage belonging to the parish, which, being very cold\nand damp, was the cause of her catching a fever, which speedily carried\nher off.  I was then bound apprentice to a farmer, in whose service I\nunderwent much coarse treatment, cold, and hunger.\n\n\"After lying in prison near two years, my father was liberated by an Act\nfor the benefit of insolvent debtors; he was then lost sight of for some\ntime; at last, however, he made his appearance in the neighbourhood\ndressed like a gentleman, and seemingly possessed of plenty of money.  He\ncame to see me, took me into a field, and asked me how I was getting on.\nI told him I was dreadfully used, and begged him to take me away with\nhim; he refused, and told me to be satisfied with my condition, for that\nhe could do nothing for me.  I had a great love for my father, and\nlikewise a great admiration for him on account of his character as a\nboxer, the only character which boys in general regard, so I wished much\nto be with him, independently of the dog's life I was leading where I\nwas; I therefore said if he would not take me with him, I would follow\nhim; he replied that I must do no such thing, for that if I did, it would\nbe my ruin.  I asked him what he meant, but he made no reply, only saying\nthat he would go and speak to the farmer.  Then taking me with him, he\nwent to the farmer, and in a very civil manner said that he understood I\nhad not been very kindly treated by him, but he hoped that in future I\nshould be used better.  The farmer answered in a surly tone, that I had\nbeen only too well treated, for that I was a worthless young scoundrel;\nhigh words ensued, and the farmer, forgetting the kind of man he had to\ndeal with, checked him with my grandsire's misfortune, and said he\ndeserved to be hanged like his father.  In a moment my father knocked him\ndown, and on his getting up, gave him a terrible beating, then taking me\nby the hand he hastened away; as we were going down a lane he said we\nwere now both done for: 'I don't care a straw for that, father,' said I,\n'provided I be with you.'  My father took me to the neighbouring town,\nand going into the yard of a small inn, he ordered out a pony and light\ncart which belonged to him, then paying his bill, he told me to mount\nupon the seat, and getting up drove away like lightning; we drove for at\nleast six hours without stopping, till we came to a cottage by the side\nof a heath; we put the pony and cart into a shed, and went into the\ncottage, my father unlocking the door with a key which he took out of his\npocket; there was nobody in the cottage when we arrived, but shortly\nafter there came a man and a woman, and then some more people, and by ten\no'clock at night there were a dozen of us in the cottage.  The people\nwere companions of my father.  My father began talking to them in Latin,\nbut I did not understand much of the discourse, though I believe it was\nabout myself, as their eyes were frequently turned to me.  Some\nobjections appeared to be made to what he said; however, all at last\nseemed to be settled, and we all sat down to some food.  After that, all\nthe people got up and went away, with the exception of the woman, who\nremained with my father and me.  The next day my father also departed,\nleaving me with the woman, telling me before he went that she would teach\nme some things which it behoved me to know.  I remained with her in the\ncottage upwards of a week; several of those who had been there coming and\ngoing.  The woman, after making me take an oath to be faithful, told me\nthat the people whom I had seen were a gang who got their livelihood by\npassing forged notes, and that my father was a principal man amongst\nthem, adding, that I must do my best to assist them.  I was a poor\nignorant child at that time, and I made no objection, thinking that\nwhatever my father did must be right; the woman then gave me some\ninstructions in the smasher's dialect of the Latin language.  I made\ngreat progress, because, for the first time in my life, I paid great\nattention to my lessons.  At last my father returned, and, after some\nconversation with the woman, took me away in his cart.  I shall be very\nshort about what happened to my father and myself during two years.  My\nfather did his best to smash the Bank of England by passing forged notes,\nand I did my best to assist him.  We attended races and fairs in all\nkinds of disguises; my father was a first-rate hand at a disguise, and\ncould appear of all ages, from twenty to fourscore; he was, however,\ngrabbed at last.  He had said, as I have told you, that he should be my\nruin, but I was the cause of his, and all owing to the misfortune of this\nhere eye of mine.  We came to this very place of Horncastle, where my\nfather purchased two horses of a young man, paying for them with three\nforged notes, purporting to be Bank of Englanders of fifty pounds each,\nand got the young man to change another of the like amount; he at that\ntime appeared as a respectable dealer, and I as his son, as I really was.\n\n\"As soon as we had got the horses, we conveyed them to one of the places\nof call belonging to our gang, of which there were several.  There they\nwere delivered into the hands of our companions, who speedily sold them\nin a distant part of the country.  The sum which they fetched--for the\ngang kept very regular accounts--formed an important item on the next day\nof sharing, of which there were twelve in the year.  The young man, whom\nmy father had paid for the horses with his smashing notes, was soon in\ntrouble about them, and ran some risk, as I heard, of being executed; but\nhe bore a good character, told a plain story, and, above all, had\nfriends, and was admitted to bail; to one of his friends he described my\nfather and myself.  This person happened to be at an inn in Yorkshire,\nwhere my father, disguised as a Quaker, attempted to pass a forged note.\nThe note was shown to this individual, who pronounced it a forgery, it\nbeing exactly similar to those for which the young man had been in\ntrouble, and which he had seen.  My father, however, being supposed a\nrespectable man, because he was dressed as a Quaker--the very reason, by\nthe bye, why anybody who knew aught of the Quakers would have suspected\nhim to be a rogue--would have been let go, had I not made my appearance,\ndressed as his footboy.  The friend of the young man looked at my eye,\nand seized hold of my father, who made a desperate resistance, I\nassisting him, as in duty bound.  Being, however, overpowered by numbers,\nhe bade me by a look, and a word or two in Latin, to make myself scarce.\nThough my heart was fit to break, I obeyed my father, who was speedily\ncommitted.  I followed him to the county town in which he was lodged,\nwhere shortly after I saw him tried, convicted, and condemned.  I then,\nhaving made friends with the jailor's wife, visited him in his cell,\nwhere I found him very much cast down.  He said, that my mother had\nappeared to him in a dream, and talked to him about a resurrection and\nChrist Jesus; there was a Bible before him, and he told me the chaplain\nhad just been praying with him.  He reproached himself much, saying, he\nwas afraid he had been my ruin, by teaching me bad habits.  I told him\nnot to say any such thing, for that I had been the cause of his, owing to\nthe misfortune of my eye.  He begged me to give over all unlawful\npursuits, saying, that if persisted in, they were sure of bringing a\nperson to destruction.  I advised him to try and make his escape,\nproposing, that when the turnkey came to let me out, he should knock him\ndown, and fight his way out, offering to assist him; showing him a small\nsaw, with which one of our companions, who was in the neighbourhood, had\nprovided me, and with which he could have cut through his fetters in five\nminutes; but he told me he had no wish to escape, and was quite willing\nto die.  I was rather hard at that time; I am not very soft now; and I\nfelt rather ashamed of my father's want of what I called spirit.  He was\nnot executed after all; for the chaplain, who was connected with a great\nfamily, stood his friend, and got his sentence commuted, as they call it,\nto transportation; and in order to make the matter easy, he induced my\nfather to make some valuable disclosures with respect to the smashers'\nsystem.  I confess that I would have been hanged before I would have done\nso, after having reaped the profit of it; that is, I think so now, seated\ncomfortably in my inn, with my bottle of champagne before me.  He,\nhowever, did not show himself carrion; he would not betray his\ncompanions, who had behaved very handsomely to him, having given the son\nof a lord, a great barrister, not a hundred-pound forged bill, but a\nhundred hard guineas, to plead his cause, and another ten, to induce him,\nafter pleading, to put his hand to his breast, and say, that, upon his\nhonour, he believed the prisoner at the bar to be an honest and injured\nman.  No; I am glad to be able to say, that my father did not show\nhimself exactly carrion, though I could almost have wished he had let\nhimself-- However, I am here with my bottle of champagne and the Romany\nRye, and he was in his cell, with bread and water and the prison\nchaplain.  He took an affectionate leave of me before he was sent away,\ngiving me three out of five guineas, all the money he had left.  He was a\nkind man, but not exactly fitted to fill my grandfather's shoes.  I\nafterwards learned that he died of fever, as he was being carried across\nthe sea.\n\n\"During the 'sizes I had made acquaintance with old Fulcher.  I was in\nthe town on my father's account, and he was there on his son's, who,\nhaving committed a small larceny, was in trouble.  Young Fulcher,\nhowever, unlike my father, got off, though he did not give the son of a\nlord a hundred guineas to speak for him, and ten more to pledge his\nsacred honour for his honesty, but gave Counsellor P--- one-and-twenty\nshillings to defend him, who so frightened the principal evidence, a\nplain honest farming-man, that he flatly contradicted what he had first\nsaid, and at last acknowledged himself to be all the rogues in the world,\nand, amongst other things, a perjured villain.  Old Fulcher, before he\nleft the town with his son,--and here it will be well to say that he and\nhis son left it in a kind of triumph, the base drummer of a militia\nregiment, to whom they had given half-a-crown, beating his drum before\nthem--old Fulcher, I say, asked me to go and visit him, telling me where,\nat such a time, I might find him and his caravan and family; offering, if\nI thought fit, to teach me basket-making: so, after my father had been\nsent off, I went and found up old Fulcher, and became his apprentice in\nthe basket-making line.  I stayed with him till the time of his death,\nwhich happened in about three months, travelling about with him and his\nfamily, and living in green lanes, where we saw gypsies and trampers, and\nall kinds of strange characters.  Old Fulcher, besides being an\nindustrious basket-maker, was an out-and-out thief, as was also his son,\nand, indeed, every member of his family.  They used to make baskets\nduring the day, and thieve during a great part of the night.  I had not\nbeen with them twelve hours before old Fulcher told me that I must thieve\nas well as the rest.  I demurred at first, for I remembered the fate of\nmy father, and what he had told me about leaving off bad courses, but\nsoon allowed myself to be over-persuaded; more especially as the first\nrobbery I was asked to do was a fruit robbery.  I was to go with young\nFulcher, and steal some fine Morell cherries, which grew against a wall\nin a gentleman's garden; so young Fulcher and I went and stole the\ncherries, one half of which we ate, and gave the rest to the old man, who\nsold them to a fruiterer ten miles off from the place where we had stolen\nthem.  The next night old Fulcher took me out with himself.  He was a\ngreat thief, though in a small way.  He used to say, that they were\nfools, who did not always manage to keep the rope below their shoulders,\nby which he meant, that it was not advisable to commit a robbery, or do\nanything which could bring you to the gallows.  He was all for petty\nlarceny, and knew where to put his hand upon any little thing in England,\nwhich it was possible to steal.  I submit it to the better judgment of\nthe Romany Rye, who I see is a great hand for words and names, whether he\nought not to have been called old Filcher, instead of Fulcher.  I shan't\ngive a regular account of the larcenies he committed during the short\ntime I knew him, either alone by himself, or with me and his son.  I\nshall merely relate the last.\n\n\"A melancholy gentleman, who lived a very solitary life, had a large carp\nin a shady pond in a meadow close to his house; he was exceedingly fond\nof it, and used to feed it with his own hand, the creature being so tame\nthat it would put its snout out of the water to be fed when it was\nwhistled to; feeding and looking at his carp were the only pleasures the\npoor melancholy gentleman possessed.  Old Fulcher--being in the\nneighbourhood, and having an order from a fishmonger for a large fish,\nwhich was wanted at a great city dinner, at which His Majesty was to be\npresent--swore he would steal the carp, and asked me to go with him.  I\nhad heard of the gentleman's fondness for his creature, and begged him to\nlet it be, advising him to go and steal some other fish; but old Fulcher\nswore, and said he would have the carp, although its master should hang\nhimself; I told him he might go by himself, but he took his son and stole\nthe carp, which weighed seventeen pounds.  Old Fulcher got thirty\nshillings for the carp, which I afterwards heard was much admired and\nrelished by His Majesty.  The master, however, of the carp, on losing his\nfavourite, became more melancholy than ever, and in a little time hanged\nhimself.  'What's sport for one, is death to another,' I once heard at\nthe village-school read out of a copy-book.\n\n\"This was the last larceny old Fulcher ever committed.  He could keep his\nneck always out of the noose, but he could not always keep his leg out of\nthe trap.  A few nights after, having removed to a distance, he went to\nan osier car in order to steal some osiers for his basket-making, for he\nnever bought any.  I followed a little way behind.  Old Fulcher had\nfrequently stolen osiers out of the car, whilst in the neighbourhood, but\nduring his absence the property, of which the car was a part, had been\nlet to a young gentleman, a great hand for preserving game.  Old Fulcher\nhad not got far into the car before he put his foot into a man-trap.\nHearing old Fulcher shriek, I ran up, and found him in a dreadful\ncondition.  Putting a large stick which I carried into the jaws of the\ntrap, I contrived to prize them open, and get old Fulcher's leg out, but\nthe leg was broken.  So I ran to the caravan, and told young Fulcher of\nwhat had happened, and he and I helped his father home.  A doctor was\nsent for, who said that it was necessary to take the leg off, but old\nFulcher, being very much afraid of pain, said it should not be taken off,\nand the doctor went away, but after some days, old Fulcher becoming\nworse, ordered the doctor to be sent for, who came and took off his leg,\nbut it was then too late, mortification had come on, and in a little time\nold Fulcher died.\n\n\"Thus perished old Fulcher; he was succeeded in his business by his son,\nyoung Fulcher, who, immediately after the death of his father, was called\nold Fulcher, it being our English custom to call everybody old, as soon\nas their fathers are buried; young Fulcher--I mean he who had been called\nyoung, but was now old Fulcher--wanted me to go out and commit larcenies\nwith him; but I told him that I would have nothing more to do with\nthieving, having seen the ill effects of it, and that I should leave them\nin the morning.  Old Fulcher begged me to think better of it, and his\nmother joined with him.  They offered, if I would stay, to give me Mary\nFulcher as a mort, till she and I were old enough to be regularly\nmarried, she being the daughter of the one, and the sister of the other.\nI liked the girl very well, for she had always been civil to me, and had\na fair complexion and nice red hair, both of which I like, being a bit of\na black myself; but I refused, being determined to see something more of\nthe world than I could hope to do with the Fulchers, and, moreover, to\nlive honestly, which I could never do along with them.  So the next\nmorning I left them: I was, as I said before, quite determined upon an\nhonest livelihood, and I soon found one.  He is a great fool who is ever\ndishonest in England.  Any person who has any natural gift, and everybody\nhas some natural gift, is sure of finding encouragement in this noble\ncountry of ours, provided he will but exhibit it.  I had not walked more\nthan three miles before I came to a wonderfully high church steeple,\nwhich stood close by the road; I looked at the steeple, and going to a\nheap of smooth pebbles which lay by the roadside, I took up some, and\nthen went into the churchyard, and placing myself just below the tower,\nmy right foot resting on a ledge, about two foot from the ground, I, with\nmy left hand--being a left-handed person, do you see--flung or chucked up\na stone, which, lighting on the top of the steeple, which was at least a\nhundred and fifty feet high, did there remain.  After repeating this feat\ntwo or three times, I 'hulled' up a stone, which went clean over the\ntower, and then one, my right foot still on the ledge, which rising at\nleast five yards above the steeple, did fall down just at my feet.\nWithout knowing it, I was showing off my gift to others besides myself,\ndoing what, perhaps, not five men in England could do.  Two men, who were\npassing by, stopped and looked at my proceedings, and when I had done\nflinging came into the churchyard, and, after paying me a compliment on\nwhat they had seen me do, proposed that I should join company with them;\nI asked them who they were, and they told me.  The one was Hopping Ned,\nand the other Biting Giles.  Both had their gifts, by which they got\ntheir livelihood; Ned could hop a hundred yards with any man in England,\nand Giles could lift up with his teeth any dresser or kitchen-table in\nthe country, and, standing erect, hold it dangling in his jaws.  There's\nmany a big oak table and dresser in certain districts of England, which\nbear the marks of Giles's teeth; and I make no doubt that, a hundred or\ntwo years hence, there'll be strange stories about those marks, and that\npeople will point them out as a proof that there were giants in bygone\ntime, and that many a dentist will moralize on the decays which human\nteeth have undergone.\n\n\"They wanted me to go about with them, and exhibit my gift occasionally,\nas they did theirs, promising that the money that was got by the\nexhibitions should be honestly divided.  I consented, and we set off\ntogether, and that evening coming to a village, and putting up at the ale-\nhouse, all the grand folks of the village being there smoking their\npipes, we contrived to introduce the subject of hopping--the upshot being\nthat Ned hopped against the school-master for a pound, and beat him\nhollow; shortly after, Giles, for a wager, took up the kitchen table in\nhis jaws, though he had to pay a shilling to the landlady for the marks\nhe left, whose grandchildren will perhaps get money by exhibiting them.\nAs for myself, I did nothing that day, but the next, on which my\ncompanions did nothing, I showed off at hulling stones against a cripple,\nthe crack man for stone-throwing, of a small town, a few miles farther\non.  Bets were made to the tune of some pounds; I contrived to beat the\ncripple, and just contrived; for to do him justice I must acknowledge he\nwas a first-rate hand at stones, though he had a game hip, and went\nsideways; his head, when he walked--if his movements could be called\nwalking--not being above three feet above the ground.  So we travelled, I\nand my companions, showing off our gifts, Giles and I occasionally for a\ngathering, but Ned never hopping, unless against somebody for a wager.  We\nlived honestly and comfortably, making no little money by our natural\nendowments, and were known over a great part of England as 'Hopping Ned,'\n'Biting Giles,' and 'Hull over the Head Jack,' which was my name, it\nbeing the blackguard fashion of the English, do you see, to--\"\n\nHere I interrupted the jockey.  \"You may call it a blackguard fashion,\"\nsaid I, \"and I dare say it is, or it would scarcely be English; but it is\nan immensely ancient one, and is handed down to us from our northern\nancestry, especially the Danes, who were in the habit of giving people\nsurnames, or rather nicknames, from some quality of body or mind, but\ngenerally from some disadvantageous peculiarity of feature; for there is\nno denying that the English, Norse, or whatever we may please to call\nthem, are an envious, depreciatory set of people, who not only give their\npoor comrades contemptuous names, but their great people also.  They\ndidn't call you the matchless Hurler, because, by doing so, they would\nhave paid you a compliment, but Hull over the Head Jack, as much as to\nsay that after all you were a scrub; so, in ancient time, instead of\ncalling Regner the great conqueror, the Nation Tamer, they surnamed him\nLodbrog, which signifies Rough or Hairy Breeks--lod or loddin signifying\nrough or hairy; and instead of complimenting Halgerdr, the wife of Gunnar\nof Hlitharend, the great champion of Iceland, upon her majestic presence,\nby calling her Halgerdr, the stately or tall; what must they do but term\nher Ha-brokr, or Highbreeks, it being the fashion in old times for\nNorthern ladies to wear breeks, or breeches, which English ladies of the\npresent day never think of doing; and just, as of old, they called\nHalgerdr Long-breeks, so this very day a fellow of Horncastle called, in\nmy hearing, our noble-looking Hungarian friend here, Long-stockings.  Oh,\nI could give you a hundred instances, both ancient and modern, of this\nunseemly propensity of our illustrious race, though I will only trouble\nyou with a few more ancient ones; they not only nicknamed Regner, but his\nsons also, who were all kings, and distinguished men: one, whose name was\nBiorn, they nicknamed Ironsides; another, Sigurd, Snake in the Eye;\nanother, White Sark, or White Shirt--I wonder they did not call him Dirty\nShirt; and Ivarr, another, who was king of Northumberland, they called\nBienlausi, or the Legless, because he was spindle-shanked, had no sap in\nhis bones, and consequently no children.  He was a great king, it is\ntrue, and very wise, nevertheless his blackguard countrymen, always\naverse, as their descendants are, to give credit to anybody, for any\nvaluable quality or possession, must needs lay hold, do you see--\"\n\nBut before I could say any more, the jockey, having laid down his pipe,\nrose, and having taken off his coat, advanced towards me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\n\nA Short-tempered Person--Gravitation--The Best Endowment--Mary\nFulcher--Fair Dealing--Horse-witchery--Darius and his Groom--The Jockey's\nTricks--The Two Characters--The Jockey's Song.\n\nThe jockey, having taken off his coat and advanced towards me, as I have\nstated in the preceding chapter, exclaimed, in an angry tone, \"This is\nthe third time you have interrupted me in my tale, Mr. Rye; I passed over\nthe two first times with a simple warning, but you will now please to get\nup and give me the satisfaction of a man.\"\n\n\"I am really sorry,\" said I, \"if I have given you offence, but you were\ntalking of our English habits of bestowing nicknames, and I could not\nrefrain from giving a few examples tending to prove what a very ancient\nhabit it is.\"\n\n\"But you interrupted me,\" said the jockey, \"and put me out of my tale,\nwhich you had no right to do; and as for your examples, how do you know\nthat I wasn't going to give some as old or older than yourn?  Now stand\nup, and I'll make an example of you.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I confess it was wrong in me to interrupt you, and I ask\nyour pardon.\"\n\n\"That won't do,\" said the jockey, \"asking pardon won't do.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said I, getting up, \"if asking pardon does not satisfy you, you are\na different man from what I considered you.\"\n\nBut here the Hungarian, also getting up, interposed his tall form and\npipe between us, saying in English, scarcely intelligible, \"Let there be\nno dispute!  As for myself, I am very much obliged to the young man of\nHorncastle for his interruption, though he has told me that one of his\ndirty townsmen called me 'Long-stocking.'  By Isten! there is more\nlearning in what he has just said than in all the verdammt English\nhistories of Thor and Tzernebock I ever read.\"\n\n\"I care nothing for his learning,\" said the jockey.  \"I consider myself\nas good a man as he, for all his learning; so stand out of the way, Mr.\nSixfooteleven, or--\"\n\n\"I shall do no such thing,\" said the Hungarian.  \"I wonder you are not\nashamed of yourself.  You ask a young man to drink champagne with you,\nyou make him dronk, he interrupt you with very good sense; he ask your\npardon, yet you not--\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the jockey, \"I am satisfied.  I am rather a short-tempered\nperson, but I bear no malice.  He is, as you say, drinking my wine, and\nhas perhaps taken a drop too much, not being used to such high liquor;\nbut one doesn't like to be put out of one's tale, more especially when\none was about to moralize, do you see, oneself, and to show off what\nlittle learning one has.  However, I bears no malice.  Here is a hand to\neach of you; we'll take another glass each, and think no more about it.\"\n\nThe jockey having shaken both of our hands, and filled our glasses and\nhis own with what champagne remained in the bottle, put on his coat, sat\ndown, and resumed his pipe and story.\n\n\"Where was I?  Oh, roaming about the country with Hopping Ned and Biting\nGiles.  Those were happy days, and a merry and prosperous life we led.\nHowever, nothing continues under the sun in the same state in which it\nbegins, and our firm was soon destined to undergo a change.  We came to a\nvillage where there was a very high church steeple, and in a little time\nmy comrades induced a crowd of people to go and see me display my gift by\nflinging stones above the heads of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, who\nstood at the four corners on the top, carved in stone.  The parson,\nseeing the crowd, came waddling out of his rectory to see what was going\non.  After I had flung up the stones, letting them fall just where I\nliked--and one, I remember, fell on the head of Mark, where I dare say it\nremains to the present day--the parson, who was one of the description of\npeople called philosophers, held up his hand, and asked me to let the\nnext stone I flung up fall upon it.  He wished, do you see, to know with\nwhat weight the stone would fall down, and talked something about\ngravitation--a word which I could never understand to the present day,\nsave that it turned out a grave matter to me.  I, like a silly fellow\nmyself, must needs consent, and, flinging the stone up to a vast height,\ncontrived so that it fell into the parson's hand, which it cut\ndreadfully.  The parson flew into a great rage, more particularly as\neverybody laughed at him, and, being a magistrate, ordered his clerk, who\nwas likewise constable, to conduct me to prison as a rogue and vagabond,\ntelling my comrades that if they did not take themselves off, he would\nserve them in the same manner.  So Ned hopped off, and Giles ran after\nhim, without making any gathering, and I was led to Bridewell, my\nmittimus following at the end of a week, the parson's hand not permitting\nhim to write before that time.  In the Bridewell I remained a month,\nwhen, being dismissed, I went in quest of my companions, whom, after some\ntime, I found up, but they refused to keep my company any longer; telling\nme that I was a dangerous character, likely to bring them more trouble\nthan profit; they had, moreover, filled up my place.  Going into a\ncottage to ask for a drink of water, they saw a country fellow making\nfaces to amuse his children; the faces were so wonderful that Hopping Ned\nand Biting Giles at once proposed taking him into partnership, and the\nman--who was a fellow not very fond of work--after a little entreaty,\nwent away with them.  I saw him exhibit his gift, and couldn't blame the\nothers for preferring him to me; he was a proper ugly fellow at all\ntimes, but when he made faces his countenance was like nothing human.  He\nwas called Ugly Moses.  I was so amazed at his faces, that though poor\nmyself I gave him sixpence, which I have never grudged to this day, for I\nnever saw anything like them.  The firm throve wonderfully after he had\nbeen admitted into it.  He died some little time ago, keeper of a public-\nhouse, which he had been enabled to take from the profits of his faces.  A\nson of his, one of the children he was making faces to when my comrades\nentered his door, is at present a barrister, and a very rising one.  He\nhas his gift--he has not, it is true, the gift of the gab, but he has\nsomething better, he was born with a grin on his face, a quiet grin; he\nwould not have done to grin through a collar like his father, and would\nnever have been taken up by Hopping Ned and Biting Giles, but that grin\nof his caused him to be noticed by a much greater person than either; an\nattorney observing it took a liking to the lad, and prophesied that he\nwould some day be heard of in the world; and in order to give him the\nfirst lift, took him into his office, at first to light fires and do such\nkind of work, and after a little time taught him to write, then promoted\nhim to a desk, articled him afterwards, and being unmarried, and without\nchildren, left him what he had when he died.  The young fellow, after\npractising at the law some time, went to the bar, where, in a few years,\nhelped on by his grin, for he had nothing else to recommend him, he\nbecame, as I said before, a rising barrister.  He comes our circuit, and\nI occasionally employ him, when I am obliged to go to law about such a\nthing as an unsound horse.  He generally brings me through--or rather\nthat grin of his does--and yet I don't like the fellow, confound him, but\nI'm an oddity--no, the one I like, and whom I generally employ, is a\nfellow quite different, a bluff sturdy dog, with no grin on his face, but\nwith a look that seems to say I am an honest man, and what cares I for\nany one?  And an honest man he is, and something more.  I have known\ncoves with a better gift of the gab, though not many, but he always\nspeaks to the purpose, and understands law thoroughly; and that's not\nall.  When at college, for he has been at college, he carried off\neverything before him as a Latiner, and was first-rate at a game they\ncall matthew mattocks.  I don't exactly know what it is, but I have heard\nthat he who is first-rate at matthew mattocks is thought more of than if\nhe were first-rate Latiner.\n\n\"Well, the chap that I'm talking about, not only came out first-rate\nLatiner, but first-rate at matthew mattocks too; doing, in fact, as I am\ntold by those who knows, for I was never at college myself, what no one\nhad ever done before.  Well, he makes his appearance at our circuit, does\nvery well, of course, but he has a somewhat high front, as becomes an\nhonest man, and one who has beat every one at Latin and matthew mattocks;\nand one who can speak first-rate law and sense;--but see now, the cove\nwith the grin, who has like myself never been at college; knows nothing\nof Latin, or matthew mattocks, and has no particular gift of the gab, has\ntwo briefs for his one, and I suppose very properly, for that grin of his\ncurries favour with the juries; and mark me, that grin of his will enable\nhim to beat the other in the long run.  We all know what all barrister\ncoves looks forward to--a seat on the hop sack.  Well, I'll bet a bull to\nfivepence, that the grinner gets upon it, and the snarler doesn't; at any\nrate, that he gets there first.  I calls my cove--for he is my cove--a\nsnarler; because your first-rates at matthew mattocks are called\nsnarlers, and for no other reason; for the chap, though with a high\nfront, is a good chap, and once drank a glass of ale with me, after\nbuying an animal out of my stable.  I have often thought it a pity he\nwasn't born with a grin on his face like the son of Ugly _Moses_.  It is\ntrue he would scarcely then have been an out and outer at Latin and\nmatthew mattocks, but what need of either to a chap born with a grin?\nTalk of being born with a silver spoon in one's mouth! give me a cove\nborn with a grin on his face--a much better endowment.\n\n\"I will now shorten my history as much as I can, for we have talked as\nmuch as folks do during a whole night in the Commons' House, though, of\ncourse, not with so much learning, or so much to the purpose,\nbecause--why?  They are in the House of Commons, and we in a public room\nof an inn at Horncastle.  The goodness of the ale, do ye see, never\ndepending on what it is made of, oh, no! but on the fashion and\nappearance of the jug in which it is served up.  After being turned out\nof the firm, I got my living in two or three honest ways, which I shall\nnot trouble you with describing.  I did not like any of them, however, as\nthey did not exactly suit my humour; at last I found one which did.  One\nSaturday afternoon, I chanced to be in the cattle-market of a place about\neighty miles from here; there I won the favour of an old gentleman who\nsold dickeys.  He had a very shabby squad of animals, without soul or\nspirit; nobody would buy them, till I leaped upon their hinder ends, and\nby merely wriggling in a particular manner, made them caper and bound so\nto people's liking, that in a few hours every one of them was sold at\nvery sufficient prices.  The old gentleman was so pleased with my skill,\nthat he took me home with him, and in a very little time into\npartnership.  It's a good thing to have a gift, but yet better to have\ntwo.  I might have got a very decent livelihood by throwing stones, but I\nmuch question whether I should ever have attained to the position in\nsociety which I now occupy, but for my knowledge of animals.  I lived\nvery comfortably with the old gentleman till he died, which he did in\nabout a fortnight after he had laid his old lady in the ground.  Having\nno children, he left me what should remain after he had been buried\ndecently, and the remainder was six dickeys and thirty shillings in\nsilver.  I remained in the dickey trade ten years, during which time I\nsaved a hundred pounds.  I then embarked in the horse line.  One day,\nbeing in the--market on a Saturday, I saw Mary Fulcher with a halter\nround her neck, led about by a man, who offered to sell her for eighteen-\npence.  I took out the money forthwith and bought her; the man was her\nhusband, a basket-maker, with whom she had lived several years without\nhaving any children; he was a drunken, quarrel-some fellow, and having\nhad a dispute with her the day before, he determined to get rid of her,\nby putting a halter round her neck and leading her to the cattle-market,\nas if she were a mare, which he had, it seems, a right to do;--all women\nbeing considered mares by old English law, and, indeed, still called\nmares in certain counties, where genuine old English is still preserved.\nThat same afternoon, the man who had been her husband, having got drunk\nin a public-house, with the money which he had received for her,\nquarrelled with another man, and receiving a blow under the ear, fell\nupon the floor, and died of artiflex; and in less than three weeks I was\nmarried to Mary Fulcher, by virtue of regular bans.  I am told she was\nlegally my property by virtue of my having bought her with a halter round\nher neck; but, to tell you the truth, I think everybody should live by\nhis trade, and I didn't wish to act shabbily towards our parson, who is a\ngood fellow, and has certainly a right to his fees.  A better wife than\nMary Fulcher--I mean Mary Dale--no one ever had; she has borne me several\nchildren, and has at all times shown a willingness to oblige me, and to\nbe my faithful wife.  Amongst other things, I begged her to have done\nwith her family, and I believe she has never spoken to them since.\n\n\"I have thriven very well in business, and my name is up as being a\nperson who can be depended on, when folks treats me handsomely.  I always\nmake a point when a gentleman comes to me, and says, 'Mr. Dale,' or\n'John,' for I have no objection to be called John by a gentleman--'I\nwants a good horse, and am ready to pay a good price'--I always makes a\npoint, I say, to furnish him with an animal worth the money; but when I\nsees a fellow, whether he calls himself gentleman or not, wishing to\ncircumvent me, what does I do?  I doesn't quarrel with him; not I; but,\nletting him imagine he is taking me in, I contrives to sell him a screw\nfor thirty pounds, not worth thirty shillings.  All honest respectable\npeople have at present great confidence in me, and frequently commissions\nme to buy them horses at great fairs like this.\n\n\"This short young gentleman was recommended to me by a great landed\nproprietor, to whom he bore letters of recommendation from some great\nprince in his own country, who had a long time ago been entertained at\nthe house of the landed proprietor, and the consequence is, that I brings\nyoung six foot six to Horncastle, and purchases for him the horse of the\nRomany Rye.  I don't do these kind things for nothing, it is true; that\ncan't be expected; for every one must live by his trade; but, as I said\nbefore, when I am treated handsomely, I treat folks so.  Honesty, I have\ndiscovered, as perhaps some other people have, is by far the best policy;\nthough, as I also said before, when I'm along with thieves, I can beat\nthem at their own game.  If I am obliged to do it, I can pass off the\nveriest screw as a flying drummedary, for even when I was a child I had\nfound out by various means what may be done with animals.  I wish now to\nask a civil question, Mr. Romany Rye.  Certain folks have told me that\nyou are a horse witch; are you one, or are you not?\"\n\n\"I, like yourself,\" said I, \"know, to a certain extent, what may be done\nwith animals.\"\n\n\"Then how would you, Mr. Romany Rye, pass off the veriest screw in the\nworld for a flying drummedary?\"\n\n\"By putting a small live eel down his throat; as long as the eel remained\nin his stomach, the horse would appear brisk and lively in a surprising\ndegree.\"\n\n\"And how would you contrive to make a regular kicker and biter appear so\ntame and gentle, that any respectable fat old gentleman of sixty, who\nwanted an easy goer, would be glad to purchase him for fifty pounds?\"\n\n\"By pouring down his throat four pints of generous old ale, which would\nmake him so happy and comfortable, that he would not have the heart to\nkick or bite anybody, for a season at least.\"\n\n\"And where did you learn all this?\" said the jockey.\n\n\"I have read about the eel in an old English book, and about the making\ndrunk in a Spanish novel, and, singularly enough, I was told the same\nthings by a wild blacksmith in Ireland.  Now tell me, do you bewitch\nhorses in this way?\"\n\n\"I?\" said the jockey; \"mercy upon us!  I wouldn't do such things for a\nhatful of money.  No, no, preserve me from live eels and hocussing!  And\nnow let me ask you, how would you spirit a horse out of a field?\"\n\n\"How would I spirit a horse out of a field?\"\n\n\"Yes; supposing you were down in the world, and had determined on taking\nup the horse-stealing line of business.\"\n\n\"Why, I should-- But I tell you what, friend, I see you are trying to\npump me, and I tell you plainly that I will hear something from you with\nrespect to your art, before I tell you anything more.  Now how would you\nwhisper a horse out of a field, provided you were down in the world, and\nso forth?\"\n\n\"Ah, ah, I see you are up to a game, Mr. Romany: however, I am a\ngentleman in mind, if not by birth, and I scorn to do the unhandsome\nthing to anybody who has dealt fairly towards me.  Now you told me\nsomething I didn't know, and I'll tell you something which perhaps you do\nknow.  I whispers a horse out of a field in this way: I have a mare in my\nstable; well, in the early season of the year I goes into my stable--Well,\nI puts the sponge into a small bottle which I keeps corked.  I takes my\nbottle in my hand, and goes into a field, suppose by night, where there\nis a very fine stag horse.  I manage with great difficulty to get within\nten yards of the horse, who stands staring at me just ready to run away.\nI then uncorks my bottle, presses my fore-finger to the sponge, and holds\nit out to the horse, the horse gives a sniff, then a start, and comes\nnearer.  I corks up my bottle and puts it into my pocket.  My business is\ndone, for the next two hours the horse would follow me anywhere--the\ndifficulty, indeed, would be to get rid of him.  Now is that your way of\ndoing business?\"\n\n\"My way of doing business?  Mercy upon us!  I wouldn't steal a horse in\nthat way, or, indeed, in any way, for all the money in the world:\nhowever, let me tell you, for your comfort, that a trick somewhat similar\nis described in the history of Herodotus.\"\n\n\"In the history of Herod's ass!\" said the jockey; \"well, if I did write a\nbook, it should be about something more genteel than a dickey.\"\n\n\"I did not say Herod's ass,\" said I, \"but Herodotus, a very genteel\nwriter, I assure you, who wrote a history about very genteel people, in a\nlanguage no less genteel than Greek, more than two thousand years ago.\nThere was a dispute as to who should be king amongst certain imperious\nchieftains.  At last they agreed to obey him whose horse should neigh\nfirst on a certain day, in front of the royal palace, before the rising\nof the sun; for you must know that they did not worship the person who\nmade the sun as we do, but the sun itself.  So one of these chieftains,\ntalking over the matter to his groom, and saying he wondered who would be\nking, the fellow said, 'Why you, master, or I don't know much about\nhorses.'  So the day before the day of trial, what does the groom do, but\ntake his master's horse before the palace and introduce him to a mare in\nthe stable, and then lead him forth again.  Well, early the next day all\nthe chieftains on their horses appeared in front of the palace before the\ndawn of day.  Not a horse neighed but one, and that was the horse of him\nwho had consulted with his groom, who, thinking of the animal within the\nstable, gave such a neigh that all the buildings rang.  His rider was\nforthwith elected king, and a brave king he was.  So this shows what\nseemingly wonderful things may be brought about by a little preparation.\"\n\n\"It doth,\" said the jockey; \"what was the chap's name?\"\n\n\"His name--his name--Darius Hystaspes.\"\n\n\"And the groom's?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"And he made a good king?\"\n\n\"First-rate.\"\n\n\"Only think! well, if he made a good king, what a wonderful king the\ngroom would have made, through whose knowledge of 'orses he was put on\nthe throne.  And now another question, Mr. Romany Rye, have you\nparticular words which have power to soothe or aggravate horses?\"\n\n\"You should ask me,\" said I, \"whether I have horses that can be\naggravated or soothed by particular words.  No words have any particular\npower over horses or other animals who have never heard them before--how,\nshould they?  But certain animals connect ideas of misery or enjoyment\nwith particular words which they are acquainted with.  I'll give you an\nexample.  I knew a cob in Ireland that could be driven to a state of\nkicking madness by a particular word, used by a particular person, in a\nparticular tone; but that word was connected with a very painful\noperation which had been performed upon him by that individual, who had\nfrequently employed it at a certain period whilst the animal had been\nunder his treatment.  The same cob could be soothed in a moment by\nanother word, used by the same individual in a very different kind of\ntone; the word was deaghblasda, or sweet tasted.  Some time after the\noperation, whilst the cob was yet under his hands, the fellow--who was\nwhat the Irish call a fairy smith--had done all he could to soothe the\ncreature, and had at last succeeded by giving it gingerbread-buttons, of\nwhich the cob became passionately fond.  Invariably, however, before\ngiving it a button, he said, 'Deaghblasda,' with which word the cob by\ndegrees associated an idea of unmixed enjoyment: so if he could rouse the\ncob to madness by the word which recalled the torture to its remembrance,\nhe could as easily soothe it by the other word, which the cob knew would\nbe instantly followed by the button, which the smith never failed to give\nhim after using the word deaghblasda.\"\n\n\"There is nothing wonderful to be done,\" said the jockey, \"without a good\ndeal of preparation, as I know myself.  Folks stare and wonder at certain\nthings which they would only laugh at if they knew how they were done;\nand to prove what I say is true, I will give you one or two examples.  Can\neither of you lend me a handkerchief?  That won't do,\" said he, as I\npresented him with a silk one.  \"I wish for a delicate white\nhandkerchief.  That's just the kind of thing,\" said he, as the Hungarian\noffered him a fine white cambric handkerchief, beautifully worked with\ngold at the hems; \"now you shall see me set this handkerchief on fire.\"\n\"Don't let him do so by any means,\" said the Hungarian, speaking to me in\nGerman, \"it is the gift of a lady whom I highly admire, and I would not\nhave it burnt for the world.\"  \"He has no occasion to be under any\napprehension,\" said the jockey, after I had interpreted to him what the\nHungarian had said, \"I will restore it to him uninjured, or my name is\nnot Jack Dale.\"  Then sticking the handkerchief carelessly into the left\nside of his bosom, he took the candle, which by this time had burnt very\nlow, and holding his head back, he applied the flame to the handkerchief,\nwhich instantly seemed to catch fire.  \"What do you think of that?\" said\nhe to the Hungarian.  \"Why, that you have ruined me,\" said the latter.\n\"No harm done, I assure you,\" said the jockey, who presently, clapping\nhis hand on his bosom, extinguished the fire, and returned the\nhandkerchief to the Hungarian, asking him if it was burnt.  \"I see no\nburn upon it,\" said the Hungarian; \"but in the name of Gott, how could\nyou set it on fire without burning it?\"  \"I never set it on fire at all,\"\nsaid the jockey; \"I set this on fire,\" showing us a piece of half-burnt\ncalico.  \"I placed this calico above it, and lighted not the\nhandkerchief, but the rag.  Now I will show you something else.  I have a\nmagic shilling in my pocket, which I can make run up along my arm.  But,\nfirst of all, I would gladly know whether either of you can do the like.\"\nThereupon the Hungarian and myself, putting our hands into our pockets,\ntook out shillings, and endeavoured to make them run up our arms, but\nutterly failed; both shillings, after we had made two or three attempts,\nfalling to the ground.  \"What noncomposses you both are,\" said the\njockey; and placing a shilling on the end of the fingers of his right\nhand he made strange faces to it, drawing back his head, whereupon the\nshilling instantly began to run up his arm, occasionally hopping and\njumping as if it were bewitched, always endeavouring to make towards the\nhead of the jockey.\n\n\"How do I do that?\" said he, addressing himself to me.  \"I really do not\nknow,\" said I, \"unless it is by the motion of your arm.\"  \"The motion of\nmy nonsense,\" said the jockey, and, making a dreadful grimace, the\nshilling hopped upon his knee, and began to run up his thigh and to climb\nup his breast.  \"How is that done?\" said he again.  \"By witchcraft, I\nsuppose,\" said I.  \"There you are right,\" said the jockey; \"by the\nwitchcraft of one of Miss Berners' hairs; the end of one of her long\nhairs is tied to that shilling by means of a hole in it, and the other\nend goes round my neck by means of a loop; so that, when I draw back my\nhead, the shilling follows it.  I suppose you wish to know how I got the\nhair,\" said he, grinning at me.  \"I will tell you.  I once, in the course\nof my ridings, saw Miss Berners beneath a hedge, combing out her long\nhair, and, being rather a modest kind of person, what must I do but get\noff my horse, tie him to a gate, go up to her, and endeavour to enter\ninto conversation with her.  After giving her the sele of the day, and\ncomplimenting her on her hair, I asked her to give me one of the threads;\nwhereupon she gave me such a look, and, calling me fellow, told me to\ntake myself off.  'I must have a hair first,' said I, making a snatch at\none.  I believe I hurt her; but, whether I did or not, up she started,\nand, though her hair was unbound, gave me the only drubbing I ever had in\nmy life.  Lor! how, with her right hand, she fibbed me whilst she held me\nround the neck with her left arm; I was soon glad to beg her pardon on my\nknees, which she gave me in a moment, when she saw me in that condition,\nbeing the most placable creature in the world, and not only her pardon,\nbut one of the hairs which I longed for, which I put through a shilling,\nwith which I have on evenings after fairs, like this, frequently worked\nwhat seemed to those who looked on downright witchcraft, but which is\nnothing more than pleasant deception.  And now, Mr. Romany Rye, to\ntestify my regard for you, I give you the shilling and the hair.  I think\nyou have a kind of respect for Miss Berners; but whether you have or not,\nkeep them as long as you can, and whenever you look at them think of the\nfinest woman in England, and of John Dale, the jockey of Horncastle.  I\nbelieve I have told you my history,\" said he--\"no, not quite; there is\none circumstance I had passed over.  I told you that I have thriven very\nwell in business, and so I have, upon the whole; at any rate, I find\nmyself comfortably off now.  I have horses, money, and owe nobody a\ngroat; at any rate, nothing but what I could pay to-morrow.  Yet I have\nhad my dreary day, ay, after I had obtained what I call a station in the\nworld.  All of a sudden, about five years ago, everything seemed to go\nwrong with me--horses became sick or died, people who owed me money broke\nor ran away, my house caught fire, in fact, everything went against me;\nand not from any mismanagement of my own.  I looked round for help,\nbut--what do you think?--nobody would help me.  Somehow or other it had\ngot abroad that I was in difficulties, and everybody seemed disposed to\navoid me, as if I had got the plague.  Those who were always offering me\nhelp when I wanted none, now, when they thought me in trouble, talked of\narresting me.  Yes; two particular friends of mine, who had always been\noffering me their purses when my own was stuffed full, now talked of\narresting me, though I only owed the scoundrels a hundred pounds each;\nand they would have done so, provided I had not paid them what I owed\nthem; and how did I do that?  Why, I was able to do it because I found a\nfriend--and who was that friend?  Why, a man who has since been hung, of\nwhom everybody has heard, and of whom everybody for the next hundred\nyears will occasionally talk.\n\n\"One day, whilst in trouble, I was visited by a person I had occasionally\nmet at sporting-dinners.  He came to look after a Suffolk Punch, the best\nhorse, by the bye, that anybody can purchase to drive, it being the only\nanimal of the horse kind in England that will pull twice at a dead\nweight.  I told him that I had none at that time that I could recommend;\nin fact, that every horse in my stable was sick.  He then invited me to\ndine with him at an inn close by, and I was glad to go with him, in the\nhope of getting rid of unpleasant thoughts.  After dinner, during which\nhe talked nothing but slang, observing I looked very melancholy, he asked\nme what was the matter with me, and I, my heart being opened by the wine\nhe had made me drink, told him my circumstances without reserve.  With an\noath or two for not having treated him at first like a friend, he said he\nwould soon set me all right; and pulling out two hundred pounds, told me\nto pay him when I could.  I felt as I never felt before; however, I took\nhis notes, paid my sneaks, and in less than three months was right again,\nand had returned him his money.  On paying it to him, I said that I had\nnow a Punch which would just suit him, saying that I would give it to\nhim--a free gift--for nothing.  He swore at me;--telling me to keep my\nPunch, for that he was suited already.  I begged him to tell me how I\ncould requite him for his kindness, whereupon, with the most dreadful\noath I ever heard, he bade me come and see him hanged when his time was\ncome.  I wrung his hand, and told him I would, and I kept my word.  The\nnight before the day he was hanged at H---, I harnessed a Suffolk Punch\nto my light gig, the same Punch which I had offered to him, which I have\never since kept, and which brought me and this short young man to\nHorncastle, and in eleven hours I drove that Punch one hundred and ten\nmiles.  I arrived at H--- just in the nick of time.  There was the ugly\njail--the scaffold--and there upon it stood the only friend I ever had in\nthe world.  Driving my Punch, which was all in a foam, into the midst of\nthe crowd, which made way for me as if it knew what I came for, I stood\nup in my gig, took off my hat, and shouted, 'God Almighty bless you,\nJack!'  The dying man turned his pale grim face towards me--for his face\nwas always somewhat grim, do you see--nodded and said, or I thought I\nheard him say, 'All right, old chap.'  The next moment--my eyes water.  He\nhad a high heart, got into a scrape whilst in the marines, lost his half-\npay, took to the turf, ring, gambling, and at last cut the throat of a\nvillain who had robbed him of nearly all he had.  But he had good\nqualities, and I know for certain that he never did half the bad things\nlaid to his charge; for example, he never bribed Tom Oliver to fight\ncross, as it was said he did on the day of the awful thunder-storm.  Ned\nFlatnose fairly beat Tom Oliver, for though Ned was not what's called a\ngood fighter, he had a particular blow, which if he could put in he was\nsure to win.  His right shoulder, do you see, was two inches farther back\nthan it ought to have been, and consequently his right fist generally\nfell short; but if he could swing himself round, and put in a blow with\nthat right arm, he could kill or take away the senses of anybody in the\nworld.  It was by putting in that blow in his second fight with Spring\nthat he beat noble Tom.  Spring beat him like a sack in the first battle,\nbut in the second Ned Painter--for that was his real name--contrived to\nput in his blow, and took the senses out of Spring; and in like manner he\ntook the senses out of Tom Oliver.\n\n\"Well, some are born to be hanged, and some are not; and many of those\nwho are not hanged are much worse than those who are.  Jack, with many a\ngood quality, is hanged, whilst that fellow of a lord, who wanted to get\nthe horse from you at about two-thirds of his value, without a single\ngood quality in the world, is not hanged, and probably will remain so.\nYou ask the reason why, perhaps.  I'll tell you; the lack of a certain\nquality called courage, which Jack possessed in abundance, will preserve\nhim; from the love which he bears his own neck he will do nothing which\ncan bring him to the gallows.  In my rough way I'll draw their characters\nfrom their childhood, and then ask whether Jack was not the best\ncharacter of the two.  Jack was a rough, audacious boy, fond of fighting,\ngoing a birds'-nesting, but I never heard he did anything particularly\ncruel save once, I believe, tying a canister to a butcher's dog's tail;\nwhilst this fellow of a lord was by nature a savage beast, and when a boy\nwould in winter pluck poor fowls naked, and set them running on the ice\nand in the snow, and was particularly fond of burning cats alive in the\nfire.  Jack, when a lad, gets a commission on board a ship as an officer\nof horse marines, and in two or three engagements behaves quite up to the\nmark--at least of a marine; the marines having no particular character\nfor courage, you know--never having run to the guns and fired them like\nmadmen after the blue jackets had had more than enough.  Oh, dear me, no!\nMy lord gets into the valorous British army, where cowardice--Oh, dear\nme!--is a thing almost entirely unknown; and being on the field of\nWaterloo the day before the battle, falls off his horse, and, pretending\nto be hurt in the back, gets himself put on the sick list--a pretty\nexcuse--hurting his back--for not being present at such a fight.  Old\nBenbow, after part of both his legs had been shot away in a sea-fight,\nmade the carpenter make him a cradle to hold his bloody stumps, and\ncontinued on deck, cheering his men till he died.  Jack returns home, and\ngets into trouble, and having nothing to subsist by but his wits, gets\nhis living by the ring and the turf, doing many an odd kind of thing, I\ndare say, but not half those laid to his charge.  My lord does much the\nsame without the excuse for doing so which Jack had, for he had plenty of\nmeans, is a leg, and a black, only in a more polished way, and with more\ncunning, and I may say success, having done many a rascally thing never\nlaid to his charge.  Jack at last cuts the throat of a villain who had\ncheated him of all he had in the world, and who, I am told, was in many\npoints the counterpart of this screw and white feather, is taken up,\ntried, and executed; and certainly taking away a man's life is a dreadful\nthing; but is there nothing as bad?  Whitefeather will cut no person's\nthroat--I will not say who has cheated him, for, being a cheat himself,\nhe will take good care that nobody cheats him, but he'll do something\nquite as bad; out of envy to a person who never injured him, and whom he\nhates for being more clever and respected than himself, he will do all he\npossibly can, by backbiting and every unfair means, to do that person a\nmortal injury.  But Jack is hanged, and my lord it not.  Is that right?\nMy wife, Mary Fulcher--I beg her pardon, Mary Dale--who is a Methodist,\nand has heard the mighty preacher, Peter Williams, says some people are\npreserved from hanging by the grace of God.  With her I differs, and says\nit is from want of courage.  This Whitefeather, with one particle of\nJack's courage, and with one tithe of his good qualities, would have been\nhanged long ago, for he has ten times Jack's malignity.  Jack was hanged\nbecause, along with his bad qualities, he had courage and generosity;\nthis fellow is not, because with all Jack's bad qualities, and many more,\namongst which is cunning, he has neither courage nor generosity.  Think\nof a fellow like that putting down two hundred pounds to relieve a\ndistressed fellow-creature; why he would rob, but for the law and the\nfear it fills him with, a workhouse child of its breakfast, as the saying\nis--and has been heard to say that he would not trust his own father for\nsixpence, and he can't imagine why such a thing as credit should be ever\ngiven.  I never heard a person give him a good word--stay, stay, yes!  I\nonce heard an old parson, to whom I sold a Punch, say that he had the art\nof receiving company gracefully and dismissing them without refreshment.\nI don't wish to be too hard with him, and so let him make the most of\nthat compliment.  Well! he manages to get on, whilst Jack is hanged; not\nquite enviably, however; he has had his rubs, and pretty hard\nones--everybody knows he slunk from Waterloo, and occasionally checks him\nwith so doing; whilst he has been rejected by a woman--what a\nmortification to the low pride of which the scoundrel has plenty!  There's\na song about both circumstances, which may, perhaps, ring in his ears on\na dying bed.  It's a funny kind of song, set to the old tune of the Lord-\nLieutenant or Deputy, and with it I will conclude my discourse, for I\nreally think it's past one.\"  The jockey then, with a very tolerable\nvoice, sung the following song:--\n\n\n\nTHE JOCKEY'S SONG.\n\n\n   Now list to a ditty both funny and true!--\n      Merrily moves the dance along--\n   A ditty that tells of a coward and screw,\n      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.\n\n   Sir Plume, though not liking a bullet at all,--\n      Merrily moves the dance along--\n   Had yet resolution to go to a _ball_,\n      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.\n\n   \"Woulez wous danser, mademoiselle?\"--\n      Merrily moves the dance along;--\n   Said she, \"Sir, to dance I should like very well,\"\n      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.\n\n   They danc'd to the left, and they danc'd to the right,--\n      Merrily moves the dance along;--\n   And her troth the fair damsel bestow'd on the knight,\n      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.\n\n   \"Now what shall I fetch you, mademoiselle?\"--\n      Merrily moves the dance along;--\n   Said she, \"Sir, an ice I should like very well,\"\n      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.\n\n   But the ice, when he'd got it, he instantly ate,--\n      Merrily moves the dance along;--\n   Although his poor partner was all in a fret,\n      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.\n\n   He ate up the ice like a prudent young lord,--\n      Merrily moves the dance along;--\n   For he saw 't was the very last ice on the board,--\n      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.\n\n   \"Now, when shall we marry?\" the gentleman cried;--\n      Merrily moves the dance along;--\n   \"Sir, get you to Jordan,\" the damsel replied,\n      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.\n\n   \"I never will wed with the pitiful elf\"--\n      Merrily moves the dance along--\n   \"Who ate up the ice which I wanted myself,\"\n      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.\n\n   \"I'd pardon your backing from red Waterloo,\"--\n      Merrily moves the dance along--\n   \"But I never will wed with a coward and screw,\"\n      My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\n\nThe Church.\n\nThe next morning I began to think of departing; I had sewed up the money\nwhich I had received for the horse in a portion of my clothing, where I\nentertained no fears for its safety, with the exception of a small sum in\nnotes, gold, and silver, which I carried in my pocket.  Ere departing,\nhowever, I determined to stroll about and examine the town, and observe\nmore particularly the humours of the fair than I had hitherto an\nopportunity of doing.  The town, when I examined it, offered no object\nworthy of attention but its church--an edifice of some antiquity; under\nthe guidance of an old man, who officiated as sexton, I inspected its\ninterior attentively, occasionally conversing with my guide, who,\nhowever, seemed much more disposed to talk about horses than the church.\n\"No good horses in the fair this time, measter,\" said he; \"none but one\nbrought hither by a chap whom nobody knows, and bought by a foreigneering\nman, who came here with Jack Dale.  The horse fetched a good swinging\nprice, which is said, however, to be much less than its worth; for the\nhorse is a regular clipper; not such a one, 'tis said, has been seen in\nthe fair for several summers.  Lord Whitefeather says that he believes\nthe fellow who brought him to be a highwayman, and talks of having him\ntaken up, but Lord Whitefeather is only in a rage because he could not\nget him for himself.  The chap would not sell it to un; Lord Screw wanted\nto beat him down, and the chap took huff, said he wouldn't sell it to him\nat no price, and accepted the offer of the foreigneering man, or of Jack,\nwho was his 'terpreter, and who scorned to higgle about such a hanimal,\nbecause Jack is a gentleman, though bred a dickey-boy, whilst t'other,\nthough bred a lord, is a screw and a whitefeather.  Every one says the\ncove was right, and I says so too; I likes spirit, and if the cove were\nhere, and in your place, measter, I would invite him to drink a pint of\nbeer.  Good horses are scarce now, measter, ay, and so are good men,\nquite a different set from what there were when I was young; that was the\ntime for men and horses.  Lord bless you, I know all the breeders about\nhere; they are not a bad set, and they breed a very fairish set of\nhorses, but they are not like what their fathers were, nor are their\nhorses like their fathers' horses.  Now there is Mr. --- the great\nbreeder, a very fairish man, with very fairish horses; but, Lord bless\nyou, he's nothing to what his father was, nor his steeds to his father's;\nI ought to know, for I was at the school here with his father, and\nafterwards for many a year helped him to get up his horses; that was when\nI was young, measter--those were the days.  You look at that monument,\nmeaster,\" said he, as I stopped and looked attentively at a monument on\nthe southern side of the church near the altar; \"that was put up for a\nrector of this church, who lived a long time ago, in Oliver's time, and\nwas ill-treated and imprisoned by Oliver and his men; you will see all\nabout it on the monument.  There was a grand battle fought nigh this\nplace, between Oliver's men and the Royal party, and the Royal party had\nthe worst of it, as I'm told they generally had; and Oliver's men came\ninto the town, and did a great deal of damage, and ill-treated the\npeople.  I can't remember anything about the matter myself, for it\nhappened just one hundred years before I was born, but my father was\nacquainted with an old countryman, who lived not many miles from here,\nwho said he remembered perfectly well the day of the battle; that he was\na boy at the time, and was working in a field near the place where the\nbattle was fought; and heard shouting, and noise of firearms, and also\nthe sound of several balls, which fell in the field near him.  Come this\nway, measter, and I will show you some remains of that day's field.\"\nLeaving the monument, on which was inscribed an account of the life and\nsufferings of the Royalist Rector of Horncastle, I followed the sexton to\nthe western end of the church, where, hanging against the wall, were a\nnumber of scythes stuck in the ends of poles.  \"Those are the weapons,\nmeaster,\" said the sexton, \"which the great people put into the hands of\nthe country folks, in order that they might use them against Oliver's\nmen; ugly weapons enough; however, Oliver's men won, and Sir Jacob Ashley\nand his party were beat.  And a rare time Oliver and his men had of it,\ntill Oliver died, when the other party got the better, not by fighting,\n'tis said, but through a General Monk, who turned sides.  Ah, the old\nfellow that my father knew, said he well remembered the time when General\nMonk went over and proclaimed Charles the Second.  Bonfires were lighted\neverywhere, oxen roasted, and beer drunk by pailfuls; the country folks\nwere drunk with joy, and something else; sung scurvy songs about Oliver\nto the tune of Barney Banks, and pelted his men, wherever they found\nthem, with stones and dirt.\"  \"The more ungrateful scoundrels they,\" said\nI.  \"Oliver and his men fought the battle of English independence against\na wretched king and corrupt lords.  Had I been living at the time, I\nshould have been proud to be a trooper of Oliver.\"  \"You would, measter,\nwould you?  Well, I never quarrels with the opinions of people who come\nto look at the church, and certainly independence is a fine thing.  I\nlike to see a chap of an independent spirit, and if I were now to see the\ncove that refused to sell his horse to my Lord Screw and Whitefeather,\nand let Jack Dale have him, I would offer to treat him to a pint of\nbeer--e'es, I would, verily.  Well, measter, you have now seen the\nchurch, and all there's in it worth seeing--so I'll just lock up, and go\nand finish digging the grave I was about when you came, after which I\nmust go into the fair to see how matters are going on.  Thank ye,\nmeaster,\" said he, as I put something into his hand; \"thank ye kindly;\n'tis not every one who gives me a shilling now-a-days who comes to see\nthe church, but times are very different from what they were when I was\nyoung; I was not sexton then, but something better; helped Mr. --- with\nhis horses, and got many a broad crown.  Those were the days, measter,\nboth for men and horses--and I say, measter, if men and horses were so\nmuch better when I was young than they are now, what, I wonder, must they\nhave been in the time of Oliver and his men?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\n\nAn Old Acquaintance.\n\nLeaving the church, I strolled through the fair, looking at the horses,\nlistening to the chaffering of the buyers and sellers, and occasionally\nputting in a word of my own, which was not always received with much\ndeference; suddenly, however, on a whisper arising that I was the young\ncove who had brought the wonderful horse to the fair which Jack Dale had\nbought for the foreigneering man, I found myself an object of the\ngreatest attention; those who had before replied with stuff! and\nnonsense! to what I said, now listened with the greatest eagerness to any\nnonsense I wished to utter, and I did not fail to utter a great deal;\npresently, however, becoming disgusted with the beings about me, I forced\nmy way, not very civilly, through my crowd of admirers; and passing\nthrough an alley and a back street, at last reached an outskirt of the\nfair, where no person appeared to know me.  Here I stood, looking\nvacantly on what was going on, musing on the strange infatuation of my\nspecies, who judge of a person's words, not from their intrinsic merit,\nbut from the opinion--generally an erroneous one--which they have formed\nof the person.  From this reverie I was roused by certain words which\nsounded near me, uttered in a strange tone, and in a strange cadence--the\nwords were, \"them that finds, wins; and them that can't find, loses.\"\nTurning my eyes in the direction from which the words proceeded, I saw\nsix or seven people, apparently all countrymen, gathered round a person\nstanding behind a tall white table of very small compass.  \"What!\" said\nI, \"the thimble-engro of --- Fair here at Horncastle.\"  Advancing nearer,\nhowever, I perceived that though the present person was a thimble-engro,\nhe was a very different one from my old acquaintance of --- Fair.  The\npresent one was a fellow about half-a-foot taller than the other.  He had\na long, haggard, wild face, and was dressed in a kind of jacket,\nsomething like that of a soldier, with dirty hempen trousers, and with a\nforeign-looking peaked hat on his head.  He spoke with an accent\nevidently Irish, and occasionally changed the usual thimble formule,\n\"them that finds wins, and them that can't--och, sure!--they loses;\"\nsaying also frequently, \"your honour,\" instead of \"my lord.\"  I observed,\non drawing nearer, that he handled the pea and thimble with some\nawkwardness, like that which might be expected from a novice in the\ntrade.  He contrived, however, to win several shillings, for he did not\nseem to play for gold, from \"their honours.\"  Awkward, as he was, he\nevidently did his best, and never flung a chance away by permitting any\none to win.  He had just won three shillings from a farmer, who, incensed\nat his loss, was calling him a confounded cheat, and saying that he would\nplay no more, when up came my friend of the preceding day, Jack, the\njockey.  This worthy, after looking at the thimble-man a moment or two,\nwith a peculiarly crafty glance, cried out, as he clapped down a shilling\non the table, \"I will stand you, old fellow!\"  \"Them that finds wins; and\nthem that can't--och, sure!--they loses,\" said the thimble-man.  The game\ncommenced, and Jack took up the thimble without finding the pea; another\nshilling was produced, and lost in the same manner; \"this is slow work,\"\nsaid Jack, banging down a guinea on the table; \"can you cover that, old\nfellow?\"  The man of the thimble looked at the gold, and then at him who\nproduced it, and scratched his head.  \"Come, cover that, or I shall be\noff,\" said the jockey.  \"Och, sure, my lord!--no, I mean your honour--no,\nsure, your lordship,\" said the other, \"if I covers it at all, it must be\nwith silver, for divil a bit of gold have I by me.\"  \"Well, then, produce\nthe value in silver,\" said the jockey, \"and do it quickly, for I can't be\nstaying here all day.\"  The thimble-man hesitated, looked at Jack with a\ndubious look, then at the gold, and then scratched his head.  There was\nnow a laugh amongst the surrounders, which evidently nettled the fellow,\nwho forthwith thrust his hand into his pocket, and pulling out all his\nsilver treasure, just contrived to place the value of the guinea on the\ntable.  \"Them that finds wins, and them that can't find--_loses_,\"\ninterrupted Jack, lifting up a thimble, out of which rolled a pea.\n\"There, paddy, what do you think of that?\" said he, seizing the heap of\nsilver with one hand, whilst he pocketed the guinea with the other.  The\nthimble-engro stood, for some time, like one transfixed, his eyes glaring\nwildly, now at the table, and now at his successful customers; at last he\nsaid, \"Arrah, sure, master!--no, I manes my lord--you are not going to\nruin a poor boy!\"  \"Ruin you!\" said the other; \"what! by winning a\nguinea's change? a pretty small dodger you--if you have not sufficient\ncapital, why do you engage in so deep a trade as thimbling? come, will\nyou stand another game?\"  \"Och, sure, master, no! the twenty shillings\nand one which you have cheated me of were all I had in the world.\"\n\"Cheated you,\" said Jack, \"say that again, and I will knock you down.\"\n\"Arrah! sure, master, you knows that the pea under the thimble was not\nmine; here is mine, master; now give me back my money.\"  \"A likely\nthing,\" said Jack; \"no, no, I know a trick worth two or three of that;\nwhether the pea was yours or mine, you will never have your twenty\nshillings and one again; and if I have ruined you, all the better; I'd\ngladly ruin all such villains as you, who ruin poor men with your dirty\ntricks, whom you would knock down and rob on the road, if you had but\ncourage; not that I mean to keep your shillings, with the exception of\nthe two you cheated from me, which I'll keep.  A scramble, boys! a\nscramble!\" said he, flinging up all the silver into the air, with the\nexception of the two shillings; and a scramble there instantly was,\nbetween the rustics who had lost their money and the urchins who came\nrunning up; the poor thimble-engro tried likewise to have his share; and\nthough he flung himself down, in order to join more effectually in the\nscramble, he was unable to obtain a single sixpence; and having in his\nrage given some of his fellow-scramblers a cuff or two, he was set upon\nby the boys and country fellows, and compelled to make an inglorious\nretreat with his table, which had been flung down in the scuffle, and had\none of its legs broken.  As he retired, the rabble hooted, and Jack,\nholding up in derision the pea with which he had outmanoeuvred him,\nexclaimed, \"I always carry this in my pocket in order to be a match for\nvagabonds like you.\"\n\nThe tumult over, Jack gone, and the rabble dispersed, I followed the\ndiscomfited adventurer at a distance, who, leaving the town, went slowly\non, carrying his dilapidated piece of furniture; till coming to an old\nwall by the roadside, he placed it on the ground, and sat down, seemingly\nin deep despondency, holding his thumb to his mouth.  Going nearly up to\nhim, I stood still, whereupon he looked up, and perceiving I was looking\nsteadfastly at him, he said, in an angry tone, \"Arrah! what for are you\nstaring at me so?  By my shoul, I think you are one of the thaives who\nare after robbing me.  I think I saw you among them, and if I were only\nsure of it, I would take the liberty of trying to give you a big bating.\"\n\"You have had enough of trying to give people a beating,\" said I; \"you\nhad better be taking your table to some skilful carpenter to get it\nrepaired.  He will do it for sixpence.\"  \"Divil a sixpence did you and\nyour thaives leave me,\" said he; \"and if you do not take yourself off,\njoy, I will be breaking your ugly head with the foot of it.\"  \"Arrah,\nMurtagh!\" said I, \"would ye be breaking the head of your friend and\nscholar, to whom you taught the blessed tongue of Oilien nan Naomha, in\nexchange for a pack of cards?\"  Murtagh, for he it was, gazed at me for a\nmoment with a bewildered look; then, with a gleam of intelligence in his\neye, he said, \"Shorsha! no, it can't be--yes, by my faith it is!\"  Then,\nspringing up, and seizing me by the hand, he said, \"Yes, by the powers,\nsure enough it is Shorsha agra!  Arrah, Shorsha! where have you been this\nmany a day?  Sure, you are not one of the spalpeens who are after robbing\nme?\"  \"Not I,\" I replied, \"but I saw all that happened.  Come, you must\nnot take matters so to heart; cheer up; such things will happen in\nconnection with the trade you have taken up.\"  \"Sorrow befall the trade,\nand the thief who taught it me,\" said Murtagh; \"and yet the trade is not\na bad one, if I only knew more of it, and had some one to help and back\nme.  Och! the idea of being cheated and bamboozled by that one-eyed thief\nin the horseman's dress.\"  \"Let bygones be bygones, Murtagh,\" said I; \"it\nis no use grieving for the past; sit down, and let us have a little\npleasant gossip.  Arrah, Murtagh! when I saw you sitting under the wall,\nwith your thumb to your mouth, it brought to my mind tales which you used\nto tell me all about Finn-ma-Coul.  You have not forgotten Finn-ma-Coul,\nMurtagh, and how he sucked wisdom out of his thumb.\"  \"Sorrow a bit have\nI forgot about him, Shorsha,\" said Murtagh, as we sat down together, \"nor\nwhat you yourself told me about the snake.  Arrah, Shorsha! what ye told\nme about the snake, bates anything I ever told you about Finn.  Ochone,\nShorsha! perhaps you will be telling me about the snake once more?  I\nthink the tale would do me good, and I have need of comfort, God knows,\nochone!\"  Seeing Murtagh in such a distressed plight, I forthwith told\nhim over again the tale of the snake, in precisely the same words as I\nhave related it in the first part of this history.  After which, I said,\n\"Now, Murtagh, tit for tat; ye will be telling me one of the old stories\nof Finn-ma-Coul.\"  \"Och, Shorsha!  I haven't heart enough,\" said Murtagh.\n\"Thank you for your tale, but it makes me weep; it brings to my mind\nDungarvon times of old--I mean the times we were at school together.\"\n\"Cheer up, man,\" said I, \"and let's have the story, and let it be about\nMa-Coul and the salmon and his thumb.\"  \"Arrah, Shorsha!  I can't.  Well,\nto oblige you, I'll give it you.  Well, you know Ma-Coul was an exposed\nchild, and came floating over the salt sea in a chest which was cast\nashore at Veintry Bay.  In the corner of that bay was a castle, where\ndwelt a giant and his wife, very respectable and decent people, and this\ngiant, taking his morning walk along the bay, came to the place where the\nchild had been cast ashore in his box.  Well, the giant looked at the\nchild, and being filled with compassion for his exposed state, took the\nchild up in his box, and carried him home to his castle, where he and his\nwife, being dacent respectable people, as I telled ye before, fostered\nthe child and took care of him, till he became old enough to go out to\nservice and gain his livelihood, when they bound him out apprentice to\nanother giant, who lived in a castle up the country, at some distance\nfrom the bay.\n\n\"This giant, whose name was Darmod David Odeen, was not a respectable\nperson at all, but a big old vagabond.  He was twice the size of the\nother giant, who, though bigger than any man, was not a big giant; for,\nas there are great and small men, so there are great and small giants--I\nmean some are small when compared with the others.  Well, Finn served\nthis giant a considerable time, doing all kinds of hard and unreasonable\nservice for him, and receiving all kinds of hard words, and many a hard\nknock and kick to boot--sorrow befall the old vagabond who could thus ill-\ntreat a helpless foundling.  It chanced that one day the giant caught a\nsalmon, near a salmon-leap upon his estate--for, though a big ould\nblackguard, he was a person of considerable landed property, and high\nsheriff for the county Cork.  Well, the giant brings home the salmon by\nthe gills, and delivers it to Finn, telling him to roast it for the\ngiant's dinner; 'but take care, ye young blackguard,' he added, 'that in\nroasting it--and I expect ye to roast it well--you do not let a blister\ncome upon its nice satin skin, for if ye do, I will cut the head off your\nshoulders.'  'Well,' thinks Finn, 'this is a hard task; however, as I\nhave done many hard tasks for him, I will try and do this too, though I\nwas never set to do anything yet half so difficult.'  So he prepared his\nfire, and put his gridiron upon it, and lays the salmon fairly and softly\nupon the gridiron, and then he roasts it, turning it from one side to the\nother just in the nick of time, before the soft satin skin could be\nblistered.  However, on turning it over the eleventh time--and twelve\nwould have settled the business--he found he had delayed a little bit of\ntime too long in turning it over, and that there was a small, tiny\nblister on the soft outer skin.  Well, Finn was in a mighty panic,\nremembering the threats of the ould giant; however, he did not lose\nheart, but clapped his thumb upon the blister in order to smooth it down.\nNow the salmon, Shorsha, was nearly done, and the flesh thoroughly hot,\nso Finn's thumb was scalt, and he, clapping it to his mouth, sucked it,\nin order to draw out the pain, and in a moment--hubbuboo!--became imbued\nwith all the wisdom of the world.\n\n_Myself_.  Stop, Murtagh! stop!\n\n_Murtagh_.  All the witchcraft, Shorsha.\n\n_Myself_.  How wonderful!\n\n_Murtagh_.  Was it not, Shorsha?  The salmon, do you see, was a fairy\nsalmon.\n\n_Myself_.  What a strange coincidence!\n\n_Murtagh_.  A what, Shorsha?\n\n_Myself_.  Why, that the very same tale should be told of Finn-ma-Coul,\nwhich is related of Sigurd Fafnisbane.\n\n\"What thief was that, Shorsha?\"\n\n\"Thief!  'Tis true, he took the treasure of Fafnir.  Sigurd was the hero\nof the North, Murtagh, even as Finn is the great hero of Ireland.  He,\ntoo, according to one account, was an exposed child, and came floating in\na casket to a wild shore, where he was suckled by a hind, and afterwards\nfound and fostered by Mimir, a fairy blacksmith; he, too, sucked wisdom\nfrom a burn.  According to the Edda, he burnt his finger whilst feeling\nof the heart of Fafnir, which he was roasting, and putting it into his\nmouth in order to suck out the pain, became imbued with all the wisdom of\nthe world, the knowledge of the language of birds, and what not.  I have\nheard you tell the tale of Finn a dozen times in the blessed days of old,\nbut its identity with the tale of Sigurd never occurred to me till now.\nIt is true, when I knew you of old, I had never read the tale of Sigurd,\nand have since almost dismissed matters of Ireland from my mind; but as\nsoon as you told me again about Finn's burning his finger, the\ncoincidence struck me.  I say, Murtagh, the Irish owe much to the Danes--\"\n\n\"Devil a bit, Shorsha, do they owe to the thaives, except many a bloody\nbating and plundering, which they never paid them back.  Och, Shorsha!\nyou, edicated in ould Ireland, to say that the Irish owes anything good\nto the plundering villains--the Siol Loughlin.\"\n\n\"They owe them half their traditions, Murtagh, and amongst others, Finn-\nma-Coul and the burnt finger; and if ever I publish the Loughlin songs,\nI'll tell the world so.\"\n\n\"But, Shorsha, the world will never believe ye--to say nothing of the\nIrish part of it.\"\n\n\"Then the world, Murtagh--to say nothing of the Irish part of it--will be\na fool, even as I have often thought it; the grand thing, Murtagh, is to\nbe able to believe oneself, and respect oneself.  How few whom the world\nbelieves believe and respect themselves.\"\n\n\"Och, Shorsha! shall I go on with the tale of Finn?\"\n\n\"I'd rather you should not, Murtagh; I know all about it already.\"\n\n\"Then why did you bother me to tell it at first, Shorsha?  Och, it was\ndoing my ownself good, and making me forget my own sorrowful state, when\nye interrupted me with your thaives of Danes!  Och, Shorsha! let me tell\nyou how Finn, by means of sucking his thumb, and the witchcraft he\nimbibed from it, contrived to pull off the arm of the ould wagabone,\nDarmod David Odeen, whilst shaking hands with him--for Finn could do no\nfeat of strength without sucking his thumb, Shorsha, as Conan the Bald\ntold the son of Oisin in the song which I used to sing ye in Dungarvon\ntimes of old;\" and here Murtagh repeated certain Irish words to the\nfollowing effect:--\n\n   \"O little the foolish words I heed\n   O Oisin's son, from thy lips which come;\n   No strength were in Finn for valorous deed,\n   Unless to the gristle he suck'd his thumb.\"\n\n\"Enough is as good as a feast, Murtagh, I am no longer in the cue for\nFinn.  I would rather hear your own history.  Now tell us, man, all that\nhas happened to ye since Dungarvon times of old?\"\n\n\"Och, Shorsha, it would be merely bringing all my sorrows back upon me!\"\n\n\"Well, if I know all your sorrows, perhaps I shall be able to find a help\nfor them.  I owe you much, Murtagh; you taught me Irish, and I will do\nall I can to help you.\"\n\n\"Why, then, Shorsha, I'll tell ye my history.  Here goes!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\n\nMurtagh's Tale.\n\n\"Well, Shorsha, about a year and a half after you left us--and a\nsorrowful hour for us it was when ye left us, losing, as we did, your\nfunny stories of your snake--and the battles of your military--they sent\nme to Paris and Salamanca, in order to make a saggart of me.\"\n\n\"Pray excuse me,\" said I, \"for interrupting you, but what kind of place\nis Salamanca?\"\n\n\"Divil a bit did I ever see of it, Shorsha!\"\n\n\"Then why did ye say ye were sent there?  Well, what kind of place is\nParis?  Not that I care much about Paris.\"\n\n\"Sorrow a bit did I ever see of either them, Shorsha, for no one sent me\nto either.  When we says at home a person is going to Paris and\nSalamanca, it manes that he is going abroad to study to be a saggart,\nwhether he goes to them places or not.  No, I never saw either--bad luck\nto them--I was shipped away from Cork up the straits to a place called\nLeghorn, from which I was sent to--to a religious house, where I was to\nbe instructed in saggarting till they had made me fit to cut a dacent\nfigure in Ireland.  We had a long and tedious voyage, Shorsha; not so\ntedious, however, as it would have been had I been fool enough to lave\nyour pack of cards behind me, as the thaif, my brother Denis, wanted to\npersuade me to do, in order that he might play with them himself.  With\nthe cards I managed to have many a nice game with the sailors, winning\nfrom them ha'pennies and sixpences until the captain said I was ruining\nhis men, and keeping them from their duty; and, being a heretic and a\nDutchman, swore that unless I gave over he would tie me up to the mast\nand give me a round dozen.  This threat obliged me to be more on my\nguard, though I occasionally contrived to get a game at night, and to win\nsixpennies and ha'pennies.\n\n\"We reached Leghorn at last, and glad I was to leave the ship and the\nmaster, who gave me a kick as I was getting over the side, bad luck to\nthe dirty heretic for kicking a son of the church, for I have always been\na true son of the church, Shorsha, and never quarrelled with it unless it\ninterfered with me in my playing at cards.  I left Leghorn with certain\nmuleteers, with whom I played at cards at the baiting-houses, and who\nspeedily won from me all the ha'pennies and sixpences I had won from the\nsailors.  I got my money's worth, however, for I learnt from the\nmuleteers all kind of quaint tricks upon the cards, which I knew nothing\nof before; so I did not grudge them what they chated me of, and when we\nparted we did so in kindness on both sides.  On getting to--I was\nreceived into the religious house for Irishes.  It was the Irish house,\nShorsha, into which I was taken, for I do not wish ye to suppose that I\nwas in the English religious house which there is in that city, in which\na purty set are educated, and in which purty doings are going on if all\ntales be true.\n\n\"In this Irish house I commenced my studies, learning to sing and to read\nthe Latin prayers of the church.  'Faith, Shorsha, many's the sorrowful\nday I passed in that house learning the prayers and litanies, being half-\nstarved, with no earthly diversion at all, at all; until I took the cards\nout of my chest and began instructing in card-playing the chum which I\nhad with me in my cell; then I had plenty of diversion along with him\nduring the times when I was not engaged in singing, and chanting, and\nsaying the prayers of the church; there was, however, some drawback in\nplaying with my chum, for though he was very clever in learning, divil a\nsixpence had he to play with, in which respect he was like myself, the\nmaster who taught him, who had lost all my money to the muleteers who\ntaught me the tricks upon the cards; by degrees, however, it began to be\nnoised about the religious house that Murtagh, from Hibrodary, {1} had a\npack of cards with which he played with his chum in the cell; whereupon\nother scholars of the religious house came to me, some to be taught and\nothers to play, so with some I played, and others I taught, but neither\nto those who could play, or to those who could not, did I teach the\nelegant tricks which I learnt from the muleteers.  Well, the scholars\ncame to me for the sake of the cards, and the porter and cook of the\nreligious house, who could both play very well, came also; at last I\nbecame tired of playing for nothing, so I borrowed a few bits of silver\nfrom the cook, and played against the porter, and by means of my tricks I\nwon money from the porter, and then I paid the cook the bits of silver\nwhich I had borrowed of him; and played with him, and won a little of his\nmoney, which I let him win back again, as I had lived long enough in a\nreligious house to know that it is dangerous to take money from the cook.\nIn a little time, Shorsha, there was scarcely anything going on in the\nhouse but card-playing; the almoner played with me, and so did the sub-\nrector, and I won money from both; not too much, however, lest they\nshould tell the rector, who had the character of a very austere man, and\nof being a bit of a saint; however, the thief of a porter, whose money I\nhad won, informed the rector of what was going on, and one day the rector\nsent for me into his private apartment, and gave me so long and pious a\nlecture upon the heinous sin of card-playing, that I thought I should\nsink into the ground; after about half-an-hour's inveighing against card-\nplaying, he began to soften his tone, and with a long sigh told me that\nat one time of his life he had been a young man himself, and had\noccasionally used the cards; he then began to ask me some questions about\ncard-playing, which questions I afterwards found were to pump from me\nwhat I knew about the science.  After a time he asked me whether I had\ngot my cards with me, and on my telling him I had, he expressed a wish to\nsee them, whereupon I took the pack out of my pocket, and showed it to\nhim; he looked at it very attentively, and at last, giving another deep\nsigh, he said, that though he was nearly weaned from the vanities of the\nworld, he had still an inclination to see whether he had entirely lost\nthe little skill which at one time he possessed.  When I heard him speak\nin this manner, I told him that if his reverence was inclined for a game\nof cards, I should be very happy to play one with him; scarcely had I\nuttered these words than he gave a third sigh, and looked so very much\nlike a saint that I was afraid he was going to excommunicate me.  Nothing\nof the kind, however, for presently he gets up and locks the door, then\nsitting down at the table, he motioned me to do the same, which I did,\nand in five minutes we were playing at cards, his reverence and myself.\n\n\"I soon found that his reverence knew quite as much about card-playing as\nI did.  Divil a trick was there connected with cards that his reverence\ndid not seem awake to.  As, however, we were not playing for money, this\ncircumstance did not give me much uneasiness; so we played game after\ngame for two hours, when his reverence, having business, told me I might\ngo, so I took up my cards, make my obedience, and left him.  The next day\nI had other games with him, and so on for a very long time, still playing\nfor nothing.  At last his reverence grew tired of playing for nothing,\nand proposed that we should play for money.  Now, I had no desire to play\nwith his reverence for money, as I knew that doing so would bring on a\nquarrel.  As long as we were playing for nothing, I could afford to let\nhis reverence use what tricks he pleased; but if we played for money, I\ncouldn't do so.  If he played his tricks, I must play mine, and use every\nadvantage to save my money; and there was one I possessed which his\nreverence did not.  The cards being my own, I had put some delicate\nlittle marks on the trump cards, just at the edges, so that when I dealt,\nby means of a little sleight of hand, I could deal myself any trump card\nI pleased.  But I wished, as I said before, to have no dealings for money\nwith his reverence, knowing that he was master in the house, and that he\ncould lead me a dog of a life if I offended him, either by winning his\nmoney, or not letting him win mine.  So I told him I had no money to play\nwith, but the ould thief knew better; he knew that I was every day\nwinning money from the scholars, and the sub-rector, and the other people\nof the house, and the ould thaif had determined to let me go on in that\nway winning money, and then by means of his tricks, which he thought I\ndare not resent, to win from me all my earnings--in a word, Shorsha, to\nlet me fill myself like a sponge, and then squeeze me for his own\nadvantage.  So he made me play with him, and in less than three days came\non the quarrel; his reverence chated me, and I chated his reverence; the\nould thaif knew every trick that I knew, and one or two more; but in\ndaling out the cards I nicked his reverence; scarcely a trump did I ever\ngive him, Shorsha, and won his money purty freely.  Och, it was a purty\nquarrel!  All the delicate names in the 'Newgate Calendar,' if ye ever\nheard of such a book; all the hang-dog names in the Newgate histories,\nand the lives of Irish rogues, did we call each other--his reverence and\nI!  Suddenly, however, putting out his hand, he seized the cards, saying,\n'I will examine these cards, ye cheating scoundrel! for I believe there\nare dirty marks on them, which ye have made in order to know the winning\ncards.'  'Give me back my pack,' said I, 'or m'anam on Dioul if I be not\nthe death of ye!'  His reverence, however, clapped the cards into his\npocket, and made the best of his way to the door, I hanging upon him.  He\nwas a gross, fat man, but, like most fat men, deadly strong, so he forced\nhis way to the door, and, opening it, flung himself out, with me still\nholding on him like a terrier dog on a big fat pig; then he shouts for\nhelp, and in a little time I was secured and thrust into a lock-up room,\nwhere I was left to myself.  Here was a purty alteration.  Yesterday I\nwas the idol of the religious house, thought more on than his reverence,\nevery one paying me court and wurtship, and wanting to play cards with\nme, and to learn my tricks, and fed, moreover, on the tidbits of the\ntable; and to-day I was in a cell, nobody coming to look at me but the\nblackguard porter who had charge of me, my cards taken from me, and with\nnothing but bread and water to live upon.  Time passed dreary enough for\na month, at the end of which time his reverence came to me, leaving the\nporter just outside the door in order to come to his help should I be\nviolent; and then he read me a very purty lecture on my conduct, saying I\nhad turned the religious house topsy-turvy, and corrupted the scholars,\nand that I was the cheat of the world, for that on inspecting the pack he\nhad discovered the dirty marks which I had made upon the trump cards for\nto know them by.  He said a great deal more to me, which is not worth\nrelating, and ended by telling me that he intended to let me out of\nconfinement next day, but that if ever I misconducted myself any more, he\nwould clap me in again for the rest of my life.  I had a good mind to\ncall him an ould thaif, but the hope of getting out made me hold my\ntongue, and the next day I was let out; and need enough I had to be let\nout, for what with being alone, and living on bread and water, I was\nbecoming frighted, or, as the doctors call it, narvous.  But when I was\nout--oh, what a change I found in the religious house! no card-playing,\nfor it had been forbidden to the scholars, and there was now nothing\ngoing on but reading and singing; divil a merry visage to be seen, but\nplenty of prim airs and graces; but the case of the scholars, though bad\nenough, was not half so bad as mine, for they could spake to each other,\nwhereas I could not have a word of conversation, for the ould thaif of a\nrector had ordered them to send me to 'Coventry,' telling them that I was\na gambling cheat, with morals bad enough to corrupt a horse regiment; and\nwhereas they were allowed to divert themselves with going out, I was kept\nreading and singing from morn till night.  The only soul who was willing\nto exchange a word with me was the cook, and sometimes he and I had a\nlittle bit of discourse in a corner, and we condoled with each other, for\nhe liked the change in the religious house almost as little as myself;\nbut he told me that, for all the change below stairs, there was still\ncard-playing on above, for that the ould thaif of a rector, and the sub-\nrector, and the almoner played at cards together, and that the rector won\nmoney from the others--the almoner had told him so--and, moreover, that\nthe rector was the thaif of the world, and had once been kicked out of a\nclub-house at Dublin for cheating at cards, and after that circumstance\nhad apparently reformed and lived decently till the time when I came to\nthe religious house with my pack, but that the sight of that had brought\nhim back to his ould gambling.  He told the cook, moreover, that the\nrector frequently went out at night to the houses of the great clergy and\ncheated at cards.\n\n\"In this melancholy state, with respect to myself, things continued a\nlong time, when suddenly there was a report that his Holiness the Pope\nintended to pay a visit to the religious house in order to examine into\nits discipline.  When I heard this I was glad, for I determined after the\nPope had done what he had come to do, to fall upon my knees before him,\nand make a regular complaint of the treatment I had received, to tell him\nof the cheating at cards of the rector, and to beg him to make the ould\nthaif give me back my pack again.  So the day of the visit came, and his\nHoliness made his appearance with his attendants, and, having looked over\nthe religious house, he went into the rector's room with the rector, the\nsub-rector, and the almoner.  I intended to have waited until his\nHoliness came out, but finding he stayed a long time I thought I would\ne'en go into him, so I went up to the door without anybody observing\nme--his attendants being walking about the corridor--and opening it I\nslipped in, and there what do you think I saw?  Why, his Holiness the\nPope, and his reverence the rector, and the sub-rector, and the almoner\nseated at cards; and the ould thaif of a rector was dealing out the cards\nwhich ye had given me, Shorsha, to his Holiness the Pope, the sub-rector,\nthe almoner, and himself.\"\n\nIn this part of his history I interrupted Murtagh, saying that I was\nafraid he was telling untruths, and that it was highly improbable that\nthe Pope would leave the Vatican to play cards with Irish at their\nreligious house, and that I was sure, if on his, Murtagh's authority, I\nwere to tell the world so, the world would never believe it.\n\n\"Then the world, Shorsha, would be a fool, even as you were just now\nsaying you had frequently believed it to be; the grand thing, Shorsha, is\nto be able to believe oneself; if ye can do that, it matters very little\nwhether the world believe ye or no.  But a purty thing for you and the\nworld to stickle at the Pope's playing at cards at a religious house of\nIrish; och! if I were to tell you and the world, what the Pope has been\nsometimes at, at the religious house of English thaives, I would excuse\nyou and the world for turning up your eyes.  However, I wish to say\nnothing against the Pope.  I am a son of the church, and if the Pope\ndon't interfere with my cards, divil a bit will I have to say against\nhim; but I saw the Pope playing, or about to play, with the pack which\nhad been taken from me, and when I told the Pope, the Pope did not--Ye\nhad better let me go on with my history, Shorsha; whether you or the\nworld believe it or not, I am sure it is quite as true as your tale of\nthe snake, or saying that Finn got his burnt finger from the thaives of\nLoughlin; and whatever you may say, I am sure the world will think so\ntoo.\"\n\nI apologized to Murtagh for interrupting him, and telling him that his\nhistory, whether true or not, was infinitely diverting, begged him to\ncontinue it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\n\nMurtagh's Story continued--The Priest, Exorcist, and Thimble-engro--How\nto Check a Rebellion.\n\nI was telling ye, Shorsha, when ye interrupted me, that I found the Pope,\nthe rector, the sub-rector, and the almoner seated at the table, the\nrector with my pack of cards in his hands, about to deal out to the Pope\nand the rest, not forgetting himself, for whom he intended all the trump-\ncards, no doubt.  No sooner did they perceive me than they seemed taken\nall aback; but the rector, suddenly starting up with the cards in his\nhand, asked me what I did there, threatening to have me well disciplined\nif I did not go about my business; 'I am come for my pack,' said I, 'ye\nould thaif, and to tell his Holiness how I have been treated by ye;' then\ngoing down on my knees before his Holiness, I said, 'Arrah, now, your\nHoliness! will ye not see justice done to a poor boy who has been sadly\nmisused?  The pack of cards which that old ruffian has in his hand are my\ncards, which he has taken from me, in order to chate with.  Arrah! don't\nplay with him, your Holiness, for he'll only chate ye--there are dirty\nmarks upon the cards which bear the trumps, put there in order to know\nthem by; and the ould thaif in daling out will give himself all the good\ncards, and chate ye of the last farthing in your pocket; so let them be\ntaken from him, your Holiness, and given back to me; and order him to\nlave the room, and then, if your Holiness be for an honest game, don't\nthink I am the boy to baulk ye.  I'll take the old ruffian's place, and\nplay with ye till evening, and all night besides, and divil an advantage\nwill I take of the dirty marks, though I know them all, having placed\nthem on the cards myself.'  I was going on in this way when the ould\nthaif of a rector, flinging down the cards, made at me as if to kick me\nout of the room, whereupon I started up and said, 'If ye are for kicking,\nsure two can play at that;' and then I kicked at his reverence, and his\nreverence at me, and there was a regular scrimmage between us, which\nfrightened the Pope, who, getting up, said some words which I did not\nunderstand, but which the cook afterwards told me were, 'English\nextravagance, and this is the second edition;' for it seems that, a\nlittle time before, his Holiness had been frightened in St. Peter's\nChurch by the servant of an English family, which those thaives of the\nEnglish religious house had been endeavouring to bring over to the\nCatholic faith, and who didn't approve of their being converted.  Och!\nhis Holiness did us all sore injustice to call us English, and to\nconfound our house with the other; for however dirty our house might be,\nour house was a clane house compared with the English house, and we\nhonest people compared with those English thaives.  Well, his Holiness\nwas frighted, and the almoner ran out, and brought in his Holiness's\nattendants, and they laid hold of me, but I struggled hard, and said, 'I\nwill not go without my pack; arrah, your Holiness! make them give me my\npack, which Shorsha gave me in Dungarvon times of old;' but my struggles\nwere of no use.  I was pulled away and put out in the ould dungeon, and\nhis Holiness went away sore frighted, crossing himself much, and never\nreturned again.\n\n\"In the old dungeon I was fastened to the wall by a chain, and there I\nwas disciplined once every other day for the first three weeks, and then\nI was left to myself, and my chain, and hunger; and there I sat in the\ndungeon, sometimes screeching, sometimes hallooing, for I soon became\nfrighted, having nothing in the cell to divert me.  At last the cook\nfound his way to me by stealth, and comforted me a little, bringing me\ntidbits out of the kitchen; and he visited me again and again--not often,\nhowever, for he dare only come when he could steal away the key from the\ncustody of the thaif of a porter.  I was three years in the dungeon, and\nshould have gone mad but for the cook, and his words of comfort, and his\ntidbits, and nice books which he brought me out of the library, which\nwere the 'Calendars of Newgate,' and the 'Lives of Irish Rogues and\nRaparees,' the only English books in the library.  However, at the end of\nthree years, the ould thaif of a rector, wishing to look at them books,\nmissed them from the library, and made a perquisition about them, and the\nthaif of a porter said that he shouldn't wonder if I had them; saying\nthat he had once seen me reading; and then the rector came with others to\nmy cell, and took my books from me, from under my straw, and asked me how\nI came by them; and on my refusal to tell, they disciplined me again till\nthe blood ran down my back; and making more perquisition they at last\naccused the cook of having carried the books to me, and not denying, he\nwas given warning to leave next day, but he left that night, and took me\naway with him; for he stole the key, and came to me and cut my chain\nthrough, and then he and I escaped from the religious house through a\nwindow--the cook with a bundle, containing what things he had.  No sooner\nhad we got out than the honest cook gave me a little bit of money and a\nloaf, and told me to follow a way which he pointed out, which he said\nwould lead to the sea; and then, having embraced me after the Italian\nway, he left me, and I never saw him again.  So I followed the way which\nthe cook pointed out, and in two days reached a seaport called Chiviter\nVik, terribly foot-foundered, and there I met a sailor who spoke Irish,\nand who belonged to a vessel just ready to sail for France; and the\nsailor took me on board his vessel, and said I was his brother, and the\ncaptain gave me a passage to a place in France called Marseilles; and\nwhen I got there, the captain and sailor got a little money for me and a\npassport, and I travelled across the country towards a place they\ndirected me to called Bayonne, from which they said I might, perhaps, get\nto Ireland.  Coming, however, to a place called Pau, all my money being\ngone, I enlisted into a regiment called the Army of the Faith, which was\ngoing into Spain, for the King of Spain had been dethroned and imprisoned\nby his own subjects, as perhaps you may have heard; and the King of\nFrance, who was his cousin, was sending an army to help him, under the\ncommand of his own son, whom the English called Prince Hilt, because when\nhe was told that he was appointed to the command, he clapped his hand on\nthe hilt of his sword.  So I enlisted into the regiment of the Faith,\nwhich was made up of Spaniards, many of them priests who had run out of\nSpain, and broken Germans, and foot-foundered Irish, like myself.  It was\nsaid to be a blackguard regiment, that same regiment of the Faith; but,\n'faith, I saw nothing blackguardly going on in it, for you would hardly\nreckon card-playing and dominoes, and pitch and toss blackguardly, and I\nsaw nothing else in it.  There was one thing in it which I disliked--the\npriests drawing their Spanish knives occasionally, when they lost their\nmoney.  After we had been some time at Pau, the army of the Faith was\nsent across the mountains into Spain, as the vanguard of the French; and\nno sooner did the Spaniards see the Faith than they made a dash at it,\nand the Faith ran away, myself along with it, and got behind the French\narmy, which told it to keep there, and the Faith did so, and followed the\nFrench army, which soon scattered the Spaniards, and in the end placed\nthe king on his throne again.  When the war was over the Faith was\ndisbanded; some of the foreigners, however, amongst whom I was one, were\nput into a Guard regiment, and there I continued for more than a year.\n\n\"One day, being at a place called the Escurial, I took stock, as the\ntradesmen say, and found I possessed the sum of eighty dollars won by\nplaying at cards, for though I could not play so well with the foreign\ncards as with the pack you gave me, Shorsha, I had yet contrived to win\nmoney from the priests and soldiers of the Faith.  Finding myself\npossessed of such a capital, I determined to leave the service, and to\nmake the best of my way to Ireland; so I deserted, but coming in an evil\nhour to a place they calls Torre Lodones, I found the priest playing at\ncards with his parishioners.  The sight of the cards made me stop, and\nthen, fool like, notwithstanding the treasure I had about me, I must wish\nto play, so not being able to speak their language, I made signs to them\nto let me play, and the priest and his thaives consented willingly; so I\nsat down to cards with the priest and two of his parishioners, and in a\nlittle time had won plenty of their money, but I had better never have\ndone any such thing, for suddenly the priest and all his parishioners set\nupon me and bate me, and took from me all I had, and cast me out of the\nvillage more dead than alive.  Och! it's a bad village that, and if I had\nknown what it was I would have avoided it, or run straight through it,\nthough I saw all the card-playing in the world going on in it.  There is\na proverb about it, as I was afterwards told, old as the time of the\nMoors, which holds good to the present day--it is, that in Torre Lodones\nthere are twenty-four housekeepers, and twenty-five thieves, maning that\nall the people are thaives, and the clergyman to boot, who is not\nreckoned a housekeeper; and troth I found the clergyman the greatest\nthaif of the lot.  After being cast out of that village I travelled for\nnearly a month, subsisting by begging tolerably well, for though most of\nthe Spanish are thaives, they are rather charitable; but though\ncharitable thaives they do not like their own being taken from them\nwithout leave being asked, as I found to my cost; for on my entering a\ngarden near Seville, without leave, to take an orange, the labourer came\nrunning up and struck me to the ground with a hatchet, giving me a big\nwound in the arm.  I fainted with loss of blood, and on reviving I found\nmyself in a hospital at Seville, to which the labourer and the people of\nthe village had taken me.  I should have died of starvation in that\nhospital had not some English people heard of me and come to see me; they\ntended me with food till I was cured, and then paid my passage on board a\nship to London, to which place the ship carried me.\n\n\"And now I was in London with five shillings in my pocket--all I had in\nthe world--and that did not last for long; and when it was gone I begged\nin the streets, but I did not get much by that, except a month's hard\nlabour in the correction-house; and when I came out I knew not what to\ndo, but thought I would take a walk in the country, for it was spring-\ntime, and the weather was fine, so I took a walk about seven miles from\nLondon, and came to a place where a great fair was being held; and there\nI begged, but got nothing but a halfpenny, and was thinking of going\nfarther, when I saw a man with a table, like that of mine, playing with\nthimbles, as you saw me.  I looked at the play, and saw him win money,\nand run away, and hunted by constables more than once.  I kept following\nthe man, and at last entered into conversation with him; and learning\nfrom him that he was in want of a companion to help him, I offered to\nhelp him if he would pay me; he looked at me from top to toe, and did not\nwish at first to have anything to do with me, as he said my appearance\nwas against me.  'Faith, Shorsha, he had better have looked at home, for\nhis appearance was not much in his favour: he looked very much like a\nJew, Shorsha.  However, he at last agreed to take me to be his companion,\nor bonnet as he called it; and I was to keep a look-out, and let him know\nwhen constables were coming, and to spake a good word for him\noccasionally, whilst he was chating folks with his thimbles and his pea.\nSo I became his bonnet, and assisted him in the fair, and in many other\nfairs beside; but I did not like my occupation much, or rather my master,\nwho, though not a big man, was a big thaif, and an unkind one, for do all\nI could I could never give him pleasure; and he was continually calling\nme fool and bogtrotter, and twitting me because I could not learn his\nthaives' Latin, and discourse with him in it, and comparing me with\nanother acquaintance, or bit of a pal of his, whom he said he had parted\nwith in the fair, and of whom he was fond of saying all kinds of\nwonderful things, amongst others, that he knew the grammar of all\ntongues.  At last, wearied with being twitted by him with not being able\nto learn his thaives' Greek, I proposed that I should teach him Irish,\nthat we should spake it together when we had anything to say in secret.\nTo that he consented willingly; but, och! a purty hand he made with\nIrish, 'faith, not much better than I did with his thaives' Hebrew.  Then\nmy turn came, and I twitted him nicely with dulness, and compared him\nwith a pal that I had in ould Ireland, in Dungarvon times of yore, to\nwhom I teached Irish, telling him that he was the broth of a boy, and not\nonly knew the grammar of all human tongues, but the dialects of the\nsnakes besides; in fact, I tould him all about your own sweet self,\nShorsha, and many a dispute and quarrel had we together about our pals,\nwhich was the cleverest fellow, his or mine.\n\n\"Well, after having been wid him about two months, I quitted him without\nnoise, taking away one of his tables, and some peas and thimbles; and\nthat I did with a safe conscience, for he paid me nothing, and was not\nover free with the meat and the drink, though I must say of him that he\nwas a clever fellow, and perfect master of his trade, by which he made a\npower of money, and bating his not being able to learn Irish, and a\ncertain Jewish lisp which he had, a great master of his tongue, of which\nhe was very proud; so much so, that he once told me that when he had\nsaved a certain sum of money he meant to leave off the thimbling\nbusiness, and enter Parliament; into which, he said, he could get at any\ntime, through the interest of a friend of his, a Tory Peer--my Lord\nWhitefeather, with whom, he said, he had occasionally done business.  With\nthe table, and other things which I had taken, I commenced trade on my\nown account, having contrived to learn a few of his tricks.  My only\ncapital was the change for half-a-guinea, which he had once let fall, and\nwhich I picked up, which was all I could ever get from him: for it was\nimpossible to stale any money from him, he was so awake, being up to all\nthe tricks of thaives, having followed the diving trade, as he called it,\nfor a considerable time.  My wish was to make enough by my table to\nenable me to return with credit to ould Ireland, where I had no doubt of\nbeing able to get myself ordained as priest; and, in troth,\nnotwithstanding I was a beginner, and without any companion to help me, I\ndid tolerably well, getting my meat and drink, and increasing my small\ncapital, till I came to this unlucky place of Horncastle, where I was\nutterly ruined by the thaif in the rider's dress.  And now, Shorsha, I am\nafter telling you my history; perhaps you will now be telling me\nsomething about yourself?\"\n\nI told Murtagh all about myself that I deemed necessary to relate, and\nthen asked him what he intended to do; he repeated that he was utterly\nruined, and that he had no prospect before him but starving, or making\naway with himself.  I inquired \"How much would take him to Ireland, and\nestablish him there with credit.\"  \"Five pounds,\" he answered, adding,\n\"but who in the world would be fool enough to lend me five pounds, unless\nit be yourself, Shorsha, who, may be, have not got it; for when you told\nme about yourself, you made no boast of the state of your affairs.\"  \"I\nam not very rich,\" I replied, \"but I think I can accommodate you with\nwhat you want.  I consider myself under great obligations to you,\nMurtagh; it was you who instructed me in the language of Oilein nan\nNaomha, which has been the foundation of all my acquisitions in\nphilology; without you, I should not have been what I am--Lavengro! which\nsignifies a philologist.  Here is the money, Murtagh,\" said I, putting my\nhand into my pocket, and taking out five pounds, \"much good may it do\nyou.\"  He took the money, stared at it, and then at me--\"And you mane to\ngive me this, Shorsha?\"  \"It is no longer mine to give,\" said I; \"it is\nyours.\"  \"And you give it me for the gratitude you bear me?\"  \"Yes,\" said\nI, \"and for Dungarvon times of old.\"  \"Well, Shorsha,\" said he, \"you are\na broth of a boy, and I'll take your benefaction--five pounds! och,\nJasus!\"  He then put the money in his pocket, and springing up, waved his\nhat three times, uttering some old Irish cry; then, sitting down, he took\nmy hand, and said, \"Sure, Shorsha, I'll be going thither; and when I get\nthere, it is turning over another leaf I will be; I have learnt a thing\nor two abroad; I will become a priest; that's the trade, Shorsha! and I\nwill cry out for repale; that's the cry, Shorsha! and I'll be a fool no\nlonger.\"  \"And what will you do with your table?\" said I.  \"'Faith, I'll\nbe taking it with me, Shorsha; and when I gets to Ireland, I'll get it\nmended, and I will keep it in the house which I shall have; and when I\nlooks upon it, I will be thinking of all I have undergone.\"  \"You had\nbetter leave it behind you,\" said I; \"if you take it with you, you will,\nperhaps, take up the thimble trade again before you get to Ireland, and\nlose the money I am after giving you.\"  \"No fear of that, Shorsha; never\nwill I play on that table again, Shorsha, till I get it mended, which\nshall not be till I am a priest, and have a house in which to place it.\"\n\nMurtagh and I then went into the town, where we had some refreshment\ntogether, and then parted on our several ways.  I heard nothing of him\nfor nearly a quarter of a century, when a person who knew him well,\ncoming from Ireland, and staying at my humble house, told me a great deal\nabout him.  He reached Ireland in safety, soon reconciled himself with\nhis Church, and was ordained a priest; in the priestly office he\nacquitted himself in a way very satisfactory, upon the whole, to his\nsuperiors, having, as he frequently said, learned wisdom abroad.  The\nPopish Church never fails to turn to account any particular gift which\nits servants may possess; and discovering soon that Murtagh was endowed\nwith considerable manual dexterity--proof of which he frequently gave at\ncards, and at a singular game which he occasionally played at thimbles--it\nselected him as a very fit person to play the part of exorcist; and\naccordingly he travelled through a great part of Ireland, casting out\ndevils from people possessed, which he afterwards exhibited, sometimes in\nthe shape of rabbits, and occasionally birds and fishes.  There is a holy\nisland in a lake in Ireland, to which the people resort at a particular\nseason of the year.  Here Murtagh frequently attended, and it was here\nthat he performed a cure which will cause his name long to be remembered\nin Ireland, delivering a possessed woman of two demons, which he\nbrandished aloft in his hands, in the shape of two large eels, and\nsubsequently hurled into the lake, amidst the shouts of an enthusiastic\nmultitude.  Besides playing the part of an exorcist, he acted that of a\npolitician with considerable success; he attached himself to the party of\nthe sire of agitation--\"the man of paunch,\" and preached and hallooed for\nrepeal with the loudest and best, as long as repeal was the cry; as soon,\nhowever, as the Whigs attained the helm of Government, and the greater\npart of the loaves and fishes--more politely termed the patronage of\nIreland--was placed at the disposition of the priesthood, the tone of\nMurtagh, like that of the rest of his brother saggarts, was considerably\nsoftened; he even went so far as to declare that politics were not\naltogether consistent with sacerdotal duty; and resuming his exorcisms,\nwhich he had for some time abandoned, he went to the Isle of Holiness,\nand delivered a possessed woman of six demons in the shape of white mice.\nHe, however, again resumed the political mantle in the year 1848, during\nthe short period of the rebellion of the so-called Young Irelanders.  The\npriests, though they apparently sided with this party, did not approve of\nit, as it was chiefly formed of ardent young men, fond of what they\ntermed liberty, and by no means admirers of priestly domination, being\nmostly Protestants.  Just before the outbreak of this rebellion, it was\ndetermined between the priests and the ---, that this party should be\nrendered comparatively innocuous by being deprived of the sinews of\nwar--in other words, certain sums of money which they had raised for\ntheir enterprise.  Murtagh was deemed the best qualified person in\nIreland to be entrusted with the delicate office of getting their money\nfrom them.  Having received his instructions, he invited the leaders to\nhis parsonage amongst the mountains, under pretence of deliberating with\nthem about what was to be done.  They arrived there just before\nnightfall, dressed in red, yellow, and green, the colours so dear to\nenthusiastic Irishmen; Murtagh received them with great apparent\ncordiality, and entered into a long discourse with them, promising them\nthe assistance of himself and order, and received from them a profusion\nof thanks.  After a time Murtagh, observing, in a jocular tone, that\nconsulting was dull work, proposed a game of cards, and the leaders,\nthough somewhat surprised, assenting, he went to a closet, and taking out\na pack of cards, laid it upon the table; it was a strange dirty pack, and\nexhibited every mark of having seen very long service.  On one of its\nguests making some remarks on the \"ancientness\" of its appearance,\nMurtagh observed that there was a very wonderful history attached to that\npack; it had been presented to him, he said, by a young gentleman, a\ndisciple of his, to whom, in Dungarvon times of yore, he had taught the\nIrish language, and of whom he related some very extraordinary things; he\nadded that he, Murtagh, had taken it to ---, where it had once the\nhappiness of being in the hands of the Holy Father; by a great\nmisfortune, he did not say what, he had lost possession of it, and had\nreturned without it, but had some time since recovered it; a nephew of\nhis, who was being educated at--for a priest, having found it in a nook\nof the college, and sent it to him.\n\nMurtagh and the leaders then played various games with this pack, more\nespecially one called by the initiated \"blind hookey,\" the result being\nthat at the end of about two hours the leaders found they had lost one-\nhalf of their funds; they now looked serious, and talked of leaving the\nhouse, but Murtagh begging them to stay to supper, they consented.  After\nsupper, at which the guests drank rather freely, Murtagh said that, as he\nhad not the least wish to win their money, he intended to give them their\nrevenge; he would not play at cards with them, he added, but at a funny\ngame of thimbles, at which they would be sure of winning back their own;\nthen going out, he brought in a table, tall and narrow, on which placing\ncertain thimbles and a pea, he proposed that they should stake whatever\nthey pleased on the almost certainty of finding the pea under the\nthimbles.  The leaders, after some hesitation, consented, and were at\nfirst eminently successful, winning back the greater part of what they\nhad lost; after some time, however, Fortune, or rather Murtagh, turned\nagainst them, and then, instead of leaving off, they doubled and trebled\ntheir stakes, and continued doing so until they had lost nearly the whole\nof their funds.  Quite furious, they now swore that Murtagh had cheated\nthem, and insisted on having their property restored to them.  Murtagh,\nwithout a word of reply, went to the door, and shouting into the passage\nsomething in Irish, the room was instantly filled with bogtrotters, each\nat least six feet high, with a stout shillelah in his hand.  Murtagh then\nturning to his guests, asked them what they meant by insulting an\nanointed priest; telling them that it was not for the likes of them to\navenge the wrongs of Ireland.  \"I have been clane mistaken in the whole\nof ye,\" said he, \"I supposed ye Irish, but have found, to my sorrow, that\nye are nothing of the kind; purty fellows to pretend to be Irish, when\nthere is not a word of Irish on the tongue of any of ye, divil a\nha'porth; the illigant young gentleman to whom I taught Irish, in\nDungarvon times of old, though not born in Ireland, has more Irish in him\nthan any ten of ye.  He is the boy to avenge the wrongs of Ireland, if\never foreigner is to do it.\"  Then saying something to the bogtrotters,\nthey instantly cleared the room of the young Irelanders, who retired\nsadly disconcerted; nevertheless, being very silly young fellows, they\nhoisted the standard of rebellion; few, however, joining them, partly\nbecause they had no money, and partly because the priests abused them\nwith might and main, their rebellion ended in a lamentable manner;\nthemselves being seized and tried, and though convicted, not deemed of\nsufficient importance to be sent to the scaffold, where they might have\nhad the satisfaction of saying--\n\n   \"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.\"\n\nMy visitor, after saying that of the money won, Murtagh retained a\nconsiderable portion, that a part went to the hierarchy for what were\ncalled church purposes, and that the--took the remainder, which it\nemployed in establishing a newspaper, in which the private characters of\nthe worthiest and most loyal Protestants in Ireland were traduced and\nvilified, concluded his account by observing, that it was the common\nbelief that Murtagh, having by his services, ecclesiastical and\npolitical, acquired the confidence of the priesthood and favour of the\nGovernment, would, on the first vacancy, be appointed to the high office\nof Popish Primate of Ireland.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\n\nDeparture from Horncastle--Recruiting Sergeant--Kauloes and Lolloes.\n\nLeaving Horncastle I bent my steps in the direction of the east.  I\nwalked at a brisk rate, and late in the evening reached a large town,\nsituate at the entrance of an extensive firth, or arm of the sea, which\nprevented my farther progress eastward.  Sleeping that night in the\nsuburbs of the town, I departed early next morning in the direction of\nthe south.  A walk of about twenty miles brought me to another large\ntown, situated on a river, where I again turned towards the east.  At the\nend of the town I was accosted by a fiery-faced individual, somewhat\nunder the middle size, dressed as a recruiting sergeant.\n\n\"Young man,\" said the recruiting sergeant, \"you are just the kind of\nperson to serve the Honourable East India Company.\"\n\n\"I had rather the Honourable Company should serve me,\" said I.\n\n\"Of course, young man.  Well, the Honourable East India Company shall\nserve you--that's reasonable.  Here, take this shilling; 'tis service-\nmoney.  The Honourable Company engages to serve you, and you the\nHonourable Company; both parties shall be thus served; that's just and\nreasonable.\"\n\n\"And what must I do for the Company?\"\n\n\"Only go to India; that's all.\"\n\n\"And what should I do in India?\"\n\n\"Fight, my brave boy! fight, my youthful hero!\"\n\n\"What kind of country is India?\"\n\n\"The finest country in the world!  Rivers, bigger than the Ouse.  Hills,\nhigher than anything near Spalding!  Trees--you never saw such trees!\nFruits--you never saw such fruits!\"\n\n\"And the people--what kind of folk are they?\"\n\n\"Pah!  Kauloes--blacks--a set of rascals not worth regarding.\"\n\n\"Kauloes!\" said I; \"blacks!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the recruiting sergeant; \"and they call us lolloes, which, in\ntheir beastly gibberish, means red.\"\n\n\"Lolloes!\" said I; \"reds!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the recruiting sergeant, \"kauloes and lolloes; and all the\nlolloes have to do is to kick and cut down the kauloes, and take from\nthem their rupees, which mean silver money.  Why do you stare so?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said I, \"this is the very language of Mr. Petulengro.\"\n\n\"Mr. Pet--?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"and Tawno Chikno.\"\n\n\"Tawno Chik--?  I say, young fellow, I don't like your way of speaking;\nno, nor your way of looking.  You are mad, sir; you are mad; and what's\nthis?  Why, your hair is grey!  You won't do for the Honourable\nCompany--they like red.  I'm glad I didn't give you the shilling.  Good\nday to you.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder,\" said I, as I proceeded rapidly along a broad\ncauseway, in the direction of the east, \"if Mr. Petulengro and Tawno\nChikno came originally from India.  I think I'll go there.\"\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX\n\n\nCHAPTER I--A Word for Lavengro.\n\n\nLavengro is the history up to a certain period of one of rather a\npeculiar mind and system of nerves, with an exterior shy and cold, under\nwhich lurk much curiosity, especially with regard to what is wild and\nextraordinary, a considerable quantity of energy and industry, and an\nunconquerable love of independence.  It narrates his earliest dreams and\nfeelings, dwells with minuteness on the ways, words, and characters of\nhis father, mother, and brother, lingers on the occasional resting-places\nof his wandering half military childhood, describes the gradual hardening\nof his bodily frame by robust exercises, his successive struggles, after\nhis family and himself have settled down in a small local capital, to\nobtain knowledge of every kind, but more particularly philological lore;\nhis visits to the tent of the Romany chal, and the parlour of the Anglo-\nGerman philosopher; the effect produced upon his character by his\nflinging himself into contact with people all widely differing from each\nother, but all extraordinary; his reluctance to settle down to the\nordinary pursuits of life; his struggles after moral truth; his glimpses\nof God and the obscuration of the Divine Being, to his mind's eye; and\nhis being cast upon the world of London by the death of his father, at\nthe age of nineteen.  In the world within a world, the world of London,\nit shows him playing his part for some time as he best can, in the\ncapacity of a writer for reviews and magazines, and describes what he saw\nand underwent whilst labouring in that capacity; it represents him,\nhowever, as never forgetting that he is the son of a brave but poor\ngentleman, and that if he is a hack author, he is likewise a scholar.  It\nshows him doing no dishonourable jobs, and proves that if he occasionally\nassociates with low characters, he does so chiefly to gratify the\ncuriosity of a scholar.  In his conversations with the apple-woman of\nLondon Bridge, the scholar is ever apparent, so again in his acquaintance\nwith the man of the table, for the book is no raker up of the uncleanness\nof London, and if it gives what at first sight appears refuse, it\ninvariably shows that a pearl of some kind, generally a philological one,\nis contained amongst it; it shows its hero always accompanied by his love\nof independence, scorning in the greatest poverty to receive favours from\nanybody, and describes him finally rescuing himself from peculiarly\nmiserable circumstances by writing a book, an original book, within a\nweek, even as Johnson is said to have written his \"Rasselas,\" and\nBeckford his \"Vathek,\" and tells how, leaving London, he betakes himself\nto the roads and fields.\n\nIn the country it shows him leading a life of roving adventure, becoming\ntinker, gypsy, postillion, ostler; associating with various kinds of\npeople, chiefly of the lower classes, whose ways and habits are\ndescribed; but, though leading this erratic life, we gather from the book\nthat his habits are neither vulgar nor vicious, that he still follows to\na certain extent his favourite pursuits, hunting after strange\ncharacters, or analysing strange words and names.  At the conclusion of\nthe last chapter, which terminates the first part of the history, it\nhints that he is about to quit his native land on a grand philological\nexpedition.\n\nThose who read this book with attention--and the author begs to observe\nthat it would be of little utility to read it hurriedly--may derive much\ninformation with respect to matters of philology and literature; it will\nbe found treating of most of the principal languages from Ireland to\nChina, and of the literature which they contain; and it is particularly\nminute with regard to the ways, manners, and speech of the English\nsection of the most extraordinary and mysterious clan or tribe of people\nto be found in the whole world--the children of Roma.  But it contains\nmatters of much more importance than anything in connection with\nphilology, and the literature and manners of nations.  Perhaps no work\nwas ever offered to the public in which the kindness and providence of\nGod have been set forth by more striking examples, or the machinations of\npriestcraft been more truly and lucidly exposed, or the dangers which\nresult to a nation when it abandons itself to effeminacy, and a rage for\nwhat is novel and fashionable, than the present.\n\nWith respect to the kindness and providence of God, are they not\nexemplified in the case of the old apple-woman and her son?  These are\nbeings in many points bad, but with warm affections, who, after an\nagonizing separation, are restored to each other, but not until the\nhearts of both are changed and purified by the influence of affliction.\nAre they not exemplified in the case of the rich gentleman, who touches\nobjects in order to avert the evil chance?  This being has great gifts\nand many amiable qualities, but does not everybody see that his besetting\nsin is selfishness?  He fixes his mind on certain objects, and takes\ninordinate interest in them, because they are his own, and those very\nobjects, through the providence of God, which is kindness in disguise,\nbecome snakes and scorpions to whip him.  Tired of various pursuits, he\nat last becomes an author, and publishes a book, which is very much\nadmired, and which he loves with his usual inordinate affection; the\nbook, consequently, becomes a viper to him, and at last he flings it\naside and begins another; the book, however, is not flung aside by the\nworld, who are benefited by it, deriving pleasure and knowledge from it:\nso the man who merely wrote to gratify self, has already done good to\nothers, and got himself an honourable name.  But God will not allow that\nman to put that book under his head and use it as a pillow: the book has\nbecome a viper to him, he has banished it, and is about another, which he\nfinishes and gives to the world; it is a better book than the first, and\nevery one is delighted with it; but it proves to the writer a scorpion,\nbecause he loves it with inordinate affection; but it was good for the\nworld that he produced this book, which stung him as a scorpion.  Yes;\nand good for himself, for the labour of writing it amused him, and\nperhaps prevented him from dying of apoplexy; but the book is banished,\nand another is begun, and herein, again, is the providence of God\nmanifested; the man has the power of producing still, and God determines\nthat he shall give to the world what remains in his brain, which he would\nnot do, had he been satisfied with the second work; he would have gone to\nsleep upon that as he would upon the first, for the man is selfish and\nlazy.  In his account of what he suffered during the composition of this\nwork, his besetting sin of selfishness is manifest enough; the work on\nwhich he is engaged occupies his every thought, it is his idol, his\ndeity, it shall be all his own, he won't borrow a thought from any one\nelse, and he is so afraid lest, when he publishes it, that it should be\nthought that he had borrowed from any one, that he is continually\ntouching objects, his nervous system, owing to his extreme selfishness,\nhaving become partly deranged.  He is left touching, in order to banish\nthe evil chance from his book, his deity.  No more of his history is\ngiven; but does the reader think that God will permit that man to go to\nsleep on his third book, however extraordinary it may be?  Assuredly not.\nGod will not permit that man to rest till he has cured him to a certain\nextent of his selfishness, which has, however, hitherto been very useful\nto the world.\n\nThen, again, in the tale of Peter Williams, is not the hand of Providence\nto be seen?  This person commits a sin in his childhood, utters words of\nblasphemy, the remembrance of which, in after life, preying upon his\nimagination, unfits him for quiet pursuits, to which he seems to have\nbeen naturally inclined; but for the remembrance of that sin, he would\nhave been Peter Williams the quiet and respectable Welsh farmer, somewhat\nfond of reading the ancient literature of his country in winter evenings,\nafter his work was done.  God, however, was aware that there was\nsomething in Peter Williams to entitle him to assume a higher calling; he\ntherefore permits this sin, which, though a childish affair, was yet a\nsin, and committed deliberately, to prey upon his mind till he becomes at\nlast an instrument in the hand of God, a humble Paul, the great preacher,\nPeter Williams, who, though he considers himself a reprobate and a\ncastaway, instead of having recourse to drinking in mad desperation, as\nmany do who consider themselves reprobates, goes about Wales and England\npreaching the word of God, dilating on his power and majesty, and\nvisiting the sick and afflicted, until God sees fit to restore to him his\npeace of mind; which he does not do, however, until that mind is in a\nproper condition to receive peace, till it has been purified by the pain\nof the one idea which has so long been permitted to riot in his brain;\nwhich pain, however, an angel, in the shape of a gentle faithful wife,\nhad occasionally alleviated; for God is merciful even in the blows which\nHe bestoweth, and will not permit any one to be tempted beyond the\nmeasure which he can support.  And here it will be as well for the reader\nto ponder upon the means by which the Welsh preacher is relieved from his\nmental misery: he is not relieved by a text from the Bible, by the words\nof consolation and wisdom addressed to him by his angel-minded wife, nor\nby the preaching of one yet more eloquent than himself; but by a\nquotation made by Lavengro from the life of Mary Flanders, cut-purse and\nprostitute, which life Lavengro had been in the habit of reading at the\nstall of his old friend the apple-woman, on London Bridge, who had\nherself been very much addicted to the perusal of it, though without any\nprofit whatever.  Should the reader be dissatisfied with the manner in\nwhich Peter Williams is made to find relief, the author would wish to\nanswer, that the Almighty frequently accomplishes his purposes by means\nwhich appear very singular to the eyes of men, and at the same time to\nobserve that the manner in which that relief is obtained, is calculated\nto read a lesson to the proud, fanciful, and squeamish, who are ever in a\nfidget lest they should be thought to mix with low society, or to bestow\na moment's attention on publications which are not what is called of a\nperfectly unobjectionable character.  Had not Lavengro formed the\nacquaintance of the apple-woman on London Bridge, he would not have had\nan opportunity of reading the life of Mary Flanders; and, consequently,\nof storing in a memory, which never forgets anything, a passage which\ncontained a balm for the agonized mind of poor Peter Williams.  The best\nmedicines are not always found in the finest shops.  Suppose, for\nexample, if, instead of going to London Bridge to read, he had gone to\nAlbemarle Street, and had received from the proprietors of the literary\nestablishment in that very fashionable street, permission to read the\npublications on the tables of the saloons there, does the reader think he\nwould have met any balm in those publications for the case of Peter\nWilliams? does the reader suppose that he would have found Mary Flanders\nthere?  He would certainly have found that highly unobjectionable\npublication, \"Rasselas,\" and the \"Spectator,\" or \"Lives of Royal and\nIllustrious Personages,\" but, of a surety, no Mary Flanders; so when\nLavengro met with Peter Williams, he would have been unprovided with a\nbalm to cure his ulcerated mind, and have parted from him in a way not\nquite so satisfactory as the manner in which he took his leave of him;\nfor it is certain that he might have read \"Rasselas,\" and all other\nunexceptionable works to be found in the library of Albemarle Street,\nover and over again, before he would have found any cure in them for the\ncase of Peter Williams.  Therefore the author requests the reader to drop\nany squeamish nonsense he may wish to utter about Mary Flanders, and the\nmanner in which Peter Williams was cured.\n\nAnd now with respect to the old man who knew Chinese, but could not tell\nwhat was o'clock.  This individual was a man whose natural powers would\nhave been utterly buried and lost beneath a mountain of sloth and\nlaziness, had not God determined otherwise.  He had in his early years\nchalked out for himself a plan of life in which he had his own ease and\nself-indulgence solely in view; he had no particular bad passions to\ngratify, he only wished to live a happy quiet life, just as if the\nbusiness of this mighty world could be carried on by innocent people fond\nof ease or quiet, or that Providence would permit innocent quiet drones\nto occupy any portion of the earth and to cumber it.  God had at any rate\ndecreed that this man should not cumber it as a drone.  He brings a\ncertain affliction upon him, the agony of which produces that terrible\nwhirling of the brain which, unless it is stopped in time, produces\nmadness; he suffers indescribable misery for a period, until one morning\nhis attention is arrested, and his curiosity is aroused, by certain\nChinese letters on a teapot; his curiosity increases more and more, and,\nof course, in proportion as his curiosity is increased with respect to\nthe Chinese marks, the misery in his brain, produced by his mental\naffliction, decreases.  He sets about learning Chinese, and after the\nlapse of many years, during which his mind subsides into a certain state\nof tranquillity, he acquires sufficient knowledge of Chinese to be able\nto translate with ease the inscriptions to be found on its singular\ncrockery.  Yes, the laziest of human beings, through the Providence of\nGod, a being too of rather inferior capacity, acquires the written part\nof a language so difficult that, as Lavengro said on a former occasion,\nnone but the cleverest people in Europe, the French, are able to acquire\nit.  But God did not intend that man should merely acquire Chinese.  He\nintended that he should be of use to his species, and by the\ninstrumentality of the first Chinese inscription which he translates, the\none which first arrested his curiosity, he is taught the duty of\nhospitality; yes, by means of an inscription in the language of a people,\nwho have scarcely an idea of hospitality themselves, God causes the\nslothful man to play a useful and beneficent part in the world, relieving\ndistressed wanderers, and, amongst others, Lavengro himself.  But a\nstriking indication of the man's surprising sloth is still apparent in\nwhat he omits to do; he has learnt Chinese, the most difficult of\nlanguages, and he practises acts of hospitality, because he believes\nhimself enjoined to do so by the Chinese inscription, but he cannot tell\nthe hour of the day by the clock within his house; he can get on, he\nthinks, very well without being able to do so; therefore from this one\nomission, it is easy to come to a conclusion as to what a sluggard's part\nthe man would have played in life, but for the dispensation of\nProvidence; nothing but extreme agony could have induced such a man to do\nanything useful.  He still continues, with all he has acquired, with all\nhis usefulness, and with all his innocence of character, without any\nproper sense of religion, though he has attained a rather advanced age.\nIf it be observed, that this want of religion is a great defect in the\nstory, the author begs leave to observe that he cannot help it.  Lavengro\nrelates the lives of people so far as they were placed before him, but no\nfurther.  It was certainly a great defect in so good a man to be without\nreligion; it was likewise a great defect in so learned a man not to be\nable to tell what was o'clock.  It is probable that God, in his loving\nkindness, will not permit that man to go out of the world without\nreligion; who knows but some powerful minister of the church full of zeal\nfor the glory of God, will illume that man's dark mind; perhaps some\nclergyman will come to the parish who will visit him and teach him his\nduty to his God.  Yes, it is very probable that such a man, before he\ndies, will have been made to love his God; whether he will ever learn to\nknow what's o'clock is another matter.  It is probable that he will go\nout of the world without knowing what's o'clock.  It is not so necessary\nto be able to tell the time of day by the clock as to know one's God\nthrough His inspired word; a man cannot get to heaven without religion,\nbut a man can get there very comfortably without knowing what's o'clock.\n\nBut, above all, the care and providence of God are manifested in the case\nof Lavengro himself, by the manner in which he is enabled to make his way\nin the world up to a certain period, without falling a prey either to\nvice or poverty.  In his history, there is a wonderful illustration of\npart of the text, quoted by his mother, \"I have been young, but now am\nold, yet never saw I the righteous forsaken, or his seed begging his\nbread.\"  He is the son of good and honourable parents, but at the\ncritical period of life, that of entering into the world, he finds\nhimself without any earthly friend to help him, yet he manages to make\nhis way; he does not become a Captain in the Life Guards, it is true, nor\ndoes he get into Parliament, nor does the last volume conclude in the\nmost satisfactory and unobjectionable manner, by his marrying a dowager\ncountess, as that wise man Addison did, or by his settling down as a\ngreat country gentleman, perfectly happy and contented, like the very\nmoral Roderick Random, or the equally estimable Peregrine Pickle; he is\nhack author, gypsy, tinker, and postillion, yet, upon the whole, he seems\nto be quite as happy as the younger sons of most earls, to have as high\nfeelings of honour; and when the reader loses sight of him, he has money\nin his pocket honestly acquired, to enable him to commence a journey\nquite as laudable as those which the younger sons of earls generally\nundertake.  Surely all this is a manifestation of the kindness and\nprovidence of God: and yet he is not a religious person; up to the time\nwhen the reader loses sight of him, he is decidedly not a religious\nperson; he has glimpses, it is true, of that God who does not forsake\nhim, but he prays very seldom, is not fond of going to church; and,\nthough he admires Tate and Brady's version of the Psalms, his admiration\nis rather caused by the beautiful poetry which that version contains than\nthe religion; yet his tale is not finished--like the tale of the\ngentleman who touched objects, and that of the old man who knew Chinese\nwithout knowing what was o'clock; perhaps, like them, he is destined to\nbecome religious, and to have, instead of occasional glimpses, frequent\nand distinct views of his God; yet, though he may become religious, it is\nhardly to be expected that he will become a very precise and\nstraightlaced person; it is probable that he will retain, with his\nscholarship, something of his gypsyism, his predilection for the hammer\nand tongs, and perhaps some inclination to put on certain gloves, not\nwhite kid, with any friend who may be inclined for a little old English\ndiversion, and a readiness to take a glass of ale, with plenty of malt in\nit, and as little hop as may well be--ale at least two years old--with\nthe aforesaid friend, when the diversion is over; for, as it is the\nbelief of the writer that a person may get to heaven very comfortably\nwithout knowing what's o'clock, so it is his belief that he will not be\nrefused admission there, because to the last he has been fond of healthy\nand invigorating exercises, and felt a willingness to partake of any of\nthe good things which it pleases the Almighty to put within the reach of\nhis children during their sojourn upon earth.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--On Priestcraft.\n\n\nThe writer will now say a few words about priestcraft, and the\nmachinations of Rome, and will afterwards say something about himself,\nand his motives for writing against them.\n\nWith respect to Rome, and her machinations, much valuable information can\nbe obtained from particular parts of Lavengro, and its sequel.  Shortly\nbefore the time when the hero of the book is launched into the world, the\nPopish agitation in England had commenced.  The Popish propaganda had\ndetermined to make a grand attempt on England; Popish priests were\nscattered over the land, doing the best they could to make converts to\nthe old superstition.  With the plans of Rome, and her hopes, and the\nreasons on which those hopes are grounded, the hero of the book becomes\nacquainted, during an expedition which he makes into the country, from\ncertain conversations which he holds with a priest in a dingle, in which\nthe hero had taken up his residence; he likewise learns from the same\nperson much of the secret history of the Roman See, and many matters\nconnected with the origin and progress of the Popish superstition.  The\nindividual with whom he holds these conversations is a learned,\nintelligent, but highly-unprincipled person, of a character however very\ncommon amongst the priests of Rome, who in general are people void of all\nreligion, and who, notwithstanding they are tied to Rome by a band which\nthey have neither the power nor wish to break, turn her and her\npractices, over their cups with their confidential associates, to a\nridicule only exceeded by that to which they turn those who become the\ndupes of their mistress and themselves.\n\nIt is now necessary that the writer should say something with respect to\nhimself, and his motives for waging war against Rome.  First of all, with\nrespect to himself, he wishes to state, that to the very last moment of\nhis life, he will do and say all that in his power may be to hold up to\ncontempt and execration the priestcraft and practices of Rome; there is,\nperhaps, no person better acquainted than himself, not even among the\nchoicest spirits of the priesthood, with the origin and history of\nPopery.  From what he saw and heard of Popery in England, at a very early\nperiod of his life, his curiosity was aroused, and he spared himself no\ntrouble, either by travel or study, to make himself well acquainted with\nit in all its phases, the result being a hatred of it, which he hopes and\ntrusts he shall retain till the moment when his spirit quits the body.\nPopery is the great lie of the world; a source from which more misery and\nsocial degradation have flowed upon the human race, than from all the\nother sources from which those evils come.  It is the oldest of all\nsuperstitions; and though in Europe it assumes the name of Christianity,\nit existed and flourished amidst the Himalayan hills at least two\nthousand years before the real Christ was born in Bethlehem of Judea; in\na word, it is Buddhism; and let those who may be disposed to doubt this\nassertion, compare the Popery of Rome, and the superstitious practices of\nits followers, with the doings of the priests who surround the grand\nLama; and the mouthings, bellowing, turnings round, and, above all, the\npenances of the followers of Buddh with those of Roman devotees.  But he\nis not going to dwell here on this point; it is dwelt upon at tolerable\nlength in the text, and has likewise been handled with extraordinary\npower by the pen of the gifted but irreligious Volney; moreover, the\n_elite_ of the Roman priesthood are perfectly well aware that their\nsystem is nothing but Buddhism under a slight disguise, and the European\nworld in general has entertained for some time past an inkling of the\nfact.\n\nAnd now a few words with respect to the motives of the writer for\nexpressing a hatred for Rome.\n\nThis expressed abhorrence of the author for Rome might be entitled to\nlittle regard, provided it were possible to attribute it to any\nself-interested motive.  There have been professed enemies of Rome, or of\nthis or that system; but their professed enmity may frequently be traced\nto some cause which does them little credit; but the writer of these\nlines has no motive, and can have no motive, for his enmity to Rome, save\nthe abhorrence of an honest heart for what is false, base, and cruel.  A\ncertain clergyman wrote with much heat against the Papists in the time\nof--who was known to favour the Papists, but was not expected to continue\nlong in office, and whose supposed successor, the person, indeed, who did\nsucceed him, was thought to be hostile to the Papists.  This divine, who\nobtained a rich benefice from the successor of--who during ---'s time had\nalways opposed him in everything he proposed to do, and who, of course,\nduring that time affected to be very inimical to Popery--this divine\nmight well be suspected of having a motive equally creditable for writing\nagainst the Papists, as that which induced him to write for them, as soon\nas his patron, who eventually did something more for him, had espoused\ntheir cause; but what motive, save an honest one, can the present writer\nhave, for expressing an abhorrence of Popery?  He is no clergyman, and\nconsequently can expect neither benefices nor bishoprics, supposing it\nwere the fashion of the present, or likely to be the fashion of any\nfuture administration, to reward clergymen with benefices or bishoprics,\nwho, in the defence of the religion of their country write, or shall\nwrite, against Popery, and not to reward those who write, or shall write,\nin favour of it, and all its nonsense and abominations.\n\n\"But if not a clergyman, he is the servant of a certain society, which\nhas the overthrow of Popery in view, and therefore,\" etc.  This\nassertion, which has been frequently made, is incorrect, even as those\nwho have made it probably knew it to be.  He is the servant of no society\nwhatever.  He eats his own bread, and is one of the very few men in\nEngland who are independent in every sense of the word.\n\nIt is true he went to Spain with the colours of that society on his\nhat--oh! the blood glows in his veins! oh! the marrow awakes in his old\nbones when he thinks of what he accomplished in Spain in the cause of\nreligion and civilization with the colours of that society in his hat,\nand its weapon in his hand, even the sword of the word of God; how with\nthat weapon he hewed left and right, making the priests fly before him,\nand run away squeaking: \"Vaya! que demonio es este!\"  Ay, and when he\nthinks of the plenty of Bible swords which he left behind him, destined\nto prove, and which have already proved, pretty calthrops in the heels of\nPopery.  \"Halloo! Batuschca,\" he exclaimed the other night, on reading an\narticle in a newspaper; \"what do you think of the present doings in\nSpain?  Your old friend the zingaro, the gitano who rode about Spain, to\nsay nothing of Galicia, with the Greek Buchini behind him as his squire,\nhad a hand in bringing them about; there are many brave Spaniards\nconnected with the present movement who took Bibles from his hands, and\nread them and profited by them, learning from the inspired page the\nduties of one man towards another, and the real value of a priesthood and\ntheir head, who set at nought the word of God, and think only of their\nown temporal interests; ay, and who learned Gitano--their own Gitano--from\nthe lips of the London Caloro, and also songs in the said Gitano, very\nfit to dumbfounder your semi-Buddhist priests when they attempt to\nbewilder people's minds with their school-logic and pseudo-ecclesiastical\nnonsense, songs such as--\n\n   \"Un Erajai\n   Sinaba chibando un sermon--.\"\n\n- But with that society he has long since ceased to have any connection;\nhe bade it adieu with feelings of love and admiration more than fourteen\nyears ago; so, in continuing to assault Popery, no hopes of interest\nfounded on that society can sway his mind--interest! who, with worldly\ninterest in view, would ever have anything to do with that society?  It\nis poor and supported, like its founder Christ, by poor people; and so\nfar from having political influence, it is in such disfavour, and has\never been, with the dastardly great, to whom the government of England\nhas for many years past been confided, that they having borne its colours\nonly for a month would be sufficient to exclude any man, whatever his\ntalents, his learning, or his courage may be, from the slightest chance\nof being permitted to serve his country either for fee, or without.  A\nfellow who unites in himself the bankrupt trader, the broken author, or\nrather book-maker, and the laughed-down single speech spouter of the\nHouse of Commons, may look forward, always supposing that at one time he\nhas been a foaming radical, to the government of an important colony.  Ay,\nan ancient fox who has lost his tail may, provided he has a score of\nradical friends, who will swear that he can bark Chinese, though Chinese\nis not barked but sung, be forced upon a Chinese colony, though it is\nwell known that to have lost one's tail is considered by the Chinese in\ngeneral as an irreparable infamy, whilst to have been once connected with\na certain society, to which, to its honour be it said, all the radical\nparty are vehemently hostile, would be quite sufficient to keep any one\nnot only from a government, but something much less, even though he could\ntranslate the rhymed \"Sessions of Hariri,\" and were versed, still\nretaining his tail, in the two languages in which Kien-Loung wrote his\nEulogium on Moukden, that piece which, translated by Amyot, the learned\nJesuit, won the applause of the celebrated Voltaire.\n\nNo! were the author influenced by hopes of fee or reward, he would,\ninstead of writing against Popery, write for it; all the trumpery\ntitled--he will not call them great again--would then be for him, and\ntheir masters the radicals, with their hosts of newspapers, would be for\nhim, more especially if he would commence maligning the society whose\ncolours he had once on his hat--a society which, as the priest says in\nthe text, is one of the very few Protestant institutions for which the\nPopish Church entertains any fear, and consequently respect, as it\nrespects nothing which it does not fear.  The writer said that certain\n\"rulers\" would never forgive him for having been connected with that\nsociety; he went perhaps too far in saying \"never.\"  It is probable that\nthey would take him into favour on one condition, which is, that he\nshould turn his pen and his voice against that society; such a mark \"of a\nbetter way of thinking\" would perhaps induce them to give him a\ngovernment, nearly as good as that which they gave to a certain ancient\nradical fox at the intercession of his radical friends (who were bound to\nkeep him from the pauper's kennel), after he had promised to foam, bark,\nand snarl at corruption no more; he might even entertain hopes of\nsucceeding, nay, of superseding, the ancient creature in his government;\nbut even were he as badly off as he is well off, he would do no such\nthing.  He would rather exist on crusts and water; he has often done so,\nand been happy; nay, he would rather starve than be a rogue--for even the\nfeeling of starvation is happiness compared with what he feels who knows\nhimself to be a rogue, provided he has any feeling at all.  What is the\nuse of a mitre or knighthood to a man who has betrayed his principles?\nWhat is the use of a gilt collar, nay, even of a pair of scarlet\nbreeches, to a fox who has lost his tail?  Oh! the horror which haunts\nthe mind of a fox who has lost his tail; and with reason, for his very\nmate loathes him, and more especially if, like himself, she has lost her\nbrush.  Oh! the horror which haunts the mind of the two-legged rogue who\nhas parted with his principles, or those which he professed--for what?\nWe'll suppose a government.  What's the use of a government, if the next\nday after you have received it, you are obliged for very shame to scurry\noff to it with the hoot of every honest man sounding in your ears?\n\n   \"Lightly liar leaped and away ran.\"\n\n   PIERS PLOWMAN.\n\nBut bigotry, it has been said, makes the author write against Popery; and\nthorough-going bigotry, indeed, will make a person say or do anything.\nBut the writer is a very pretty bigot truly!  Where will the public find\ntraces of bigotry in anything he has written?  He has written against\nRome with all his heart, with all his mind, with all his soul, and with\nall his strength; but as a person may be quite honest, and speak and\nwrite against Rome, in like manner he may speak and write against her,\nand be quite free from bigotry; though it is impossible for any one but a\nbigot or a bad man to write or speak in her praise; her doctrines,\nactions, and machinations being what they are.\n\nBigotry!  The author was born, and has always continued in the wrong\nchurch for bigotry, the quiet, unpretending Church of England; a church\nwhich, had it been a bigoted church, and not long suffering almost to a\nfault, might with its opportunities, as the priest says in the text, have\nstood in a very different position from that which it occupies at\npresent.  No! let those who are in search of bigotry, seek for it in a\nchurch very different from the inoffensive Church of England, which never\nencourages cruelty or calumny.  Let them seek for it amongst the members\nof the Church of Rome, and more especially amongst those who have\nrenegaded to it.  There is nothing, however false and horrible, which a\npervert to Rome will not say for his church, and which his priests will\nnot encourage him in saying; and there is nothing, however horrible--the\nmore horrible indeed and revolting to human nature, the more eager he\nwould be to do it--which he will not do for it, and which his priests\nwill not encourage him in doing.\n\nOf the readiness which converts to Popery exhibit to sacrifice all the\nties of blood and affection on the shrine of their newly-adopted\nreligion, there is a curious illustration in the work of Luigi Pulci.\nThis man, who was born at Florence in the year 1432, and who was deeply\nversed in the Bible, composed a poem, called the \"Morgante Maggiore,\"\nwhich he recited at the table of Lorenzo de Medici, the great patron of\nItalian genius.  It is a mock-heroic and religious poem, in which the\nlegends of knight-errantry, and of the Popish Church, are turned to\nunbounded ridicule.  The pretended hero of it is a converted giant,\ncalled Morgante; though his adventures do not occupy the twentieth part\nof the poem, the principal personages being Charlemagne, Orlando, and his\ncousin Rinaldo of Montalban.  Morgante has two brothers, both of them\ngiants, and in the first canto of the poem, Morgante is represented with\nhis brothers as carrying on a feud with the abbot and monks of a certain\nconvent, built upon the confines of heathenesse; the giants being in the\nhabit of flinging down stones, or rather huge rocks, on the convent.\nOrlando, however, who is banished from the court of Charlemagne, arriving\nat the convent, undertakes to destroy them, and, accordingly, kills\nPassamonte and Alabastro, and converts Morgante, whose mind had been\npreviously softened by a vision, in which the \"Blessed Virgin\" figures.\nNo sooner is he converted than, as a sign of his penitence, what does he\ndo, but hastens and cuts off the hands of his two brothers, saying--\n\n   \"Io vo' tagliar le mani a tutti quanti\n   E porterolle a que' monaci santi.\"\n\nAnd he does cut off the hands of his brethren, and carries them to the\nabbot, who blesses him for so doing.  Pulci here is holding up to\nridicule and execration the horrid butchery or betrayal of friends by\npopish converts, and the encouragement they receive from the priest.  No\nsooner is a person converted to Popery, than his principal thought is how\nhe can bring the hands and feet of his brethren, however harmless they\nmay be, and different from the giants, to the \"holy priests,\" who, if he\nmanages to do so, never fail to praise him, saying to the miserable\nwretch, as the abbot said to Morgante:--\n\n   \"Tu sarai or perfetto e vero amico\n   A Cristo, quanto tu gli eri nemico.\"\n\nCan the English public deny the justice of Pulci's illustration, after\nsomething which it has lately witnessed?  Has it not seen equivalents for\nthe hands and feet of brothers carried by popish perverts to the \"holy\npriests,\" and has it not seen the manner in which the offering has been\nreceived?  Let those who are in quest of bigotry seek for it among the\nperverts to Rome, and not amongst those who, born in the pale of the\nChurch of England, have always continued in it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--On Foreign Nonsense.\n\n\nWith respect to the third point, various lessons which the book reads to\nthe nation at large, and which it would be well for the nation to ponder\nand profit by.\n\nThere are many species of nonsense to which the nation is much addicted,\nand of which the perusal of Lavengro ought to give them a wholesome\nshame.  First of all, with respect to the foreign nonsense so prevalent\nnow in England.  The hero is a scholar; but, though possessed of a great\nmany tongues, he affects to be neither Frenchman, nor German, nor this or\nthat foreigner; he is one who loves his country, and the language and\nliterature of his country, and speaks up for each and all when there is\noccasion to do so.  Now what is the case with nine out of ten amongst\nthose of the English who study foreign languages?  No sooner have they\npicked up a smattering of this or that speech than they begin to abuse\ntheir own country, and everything connected with it, more especially its\nlanguage.  This is particularly the case with those who call themselves\nGerman students.  It is said, and the writer believes with truth, that\nwhen a woman falls in love with a particularly ugly fellow, she squeezes\nhim with ten times more zest than she would a handsome one, if captivated\nby him.  So it is with these German students; no sooner have they taken\nGerman in hand than there is nothing like German.  Oh, the dear\ndelightful German!  How proud I am that it is now my own, and that its\ndivine literature is within my reach!  And all this whilst mumbling the\nmost uncouth speech, and crunching the most crabbed literature in Europe.\nThe writer is not an exclusive admirer of everything English; he does not\nadvise his country people never to go abroad, never to study foreign\nlanguages, and he does not wish to persuade them that there is nothing\nbeautiful or valuable in foreign literature; he only wishes that they\nwould not make themselves fools with respect to foreign people, foreign\nlanguages or reading; that if they chance to have been in Spain, and have\npicked up a little Spanish, they would not affect the airs of Spaniards;\nthat if males they would not make Tomfools of themselves by sticking\ncigars into their mouths, dressing themselves in zamarras, and saying,\ncarajo! {2} and if females that they would not make zanies of themselves\nby sticking cigars into their mouths, flinging mantillas over their\nheads, and by saying carai, and perhaps carajo too; or if they have been\nin France or Italy, and have picked up a little French or Italian, they\nwould not affect to be French or Italians; and particularly, after having\nbeen a month or two in Germany, or picked up a little German in England,\nthey would not make themselves foolish about everything German, as the\nAnglo-German in the book does--a real character, the founder of the Anglo-\nGerman school in England, and the cleverest Englishman who ever talked or\nwrote encomiastic nonsense about Germany and the Germans.  Of all\ninfatuations connected with what is foreign, the infatuation about\neverything that is German, to a certain extent prevalent in England, is\nassuredly the most ridiculous.  One can find something like a palliation\nfor people making themselves somewhat foolish about particular languages,\nliteratures, and people.  The Spanish certainly is a noble language, and\nthere is something wild and captivating in the Spanish character, and its\nliterature contains the grand book of the world.  French is a manly\nlanguage.  The French are the great martial people in the world; and\nFrench literature is admirable in many respects.  Italian is a sweet\nlanguage, and of beautiful simplicity--its literature perhaps the first\nin the world.  The Italians!--wonderful men have sprung up in Italy.\nItaly is not merely famous for painters, poets, musicians, singers, and\nlinguists--the greatest linguist the world ever saw, the late Cardinal\nMezzofanti, was an Italian; but it is celebrated for men--men\nemphatically speaking: Columbus was an Italian, Alexander Farnese was an\nItalian, so was the mightiest of the mighty, Napoleon Bonaparte;--but the\nGerman language, German literature, and the Germans!  The writer has\nalready stated his opinion with respect to German; he does not speak from\nignorance or prejudice; he has heard German spoken, and many other\nlanguages.  German literature!  He does not speak from ignorance, he has\nread that and many a literature, and he repeats-- However, he\nacknowledges that there is one fine poem in the German language, that\npoem is the \"Oberon;\" a poem, by the bye, ignored by the Germans--a\nspeaking fact--and of course, by the Anglo-Germanists.  The Germans! he\nhas been amongst them, and amongst many other nations, and confesses that\nhis opinion of the Germans, as men, is a very low one.  Germany, it is\ntrue, has produced one very great man, the monk who fought the Pope, and\nnearly knocked him down; but this man his countrymen--a telling\nfact--affect to despise, and, of course, the Anglo-Germanists: the father\nof Anglo-Germanism was very fond of inveighing against Luther.\n\nThe madness, or rather foolery, of the English for foreign customs,\ndresses, and languages, is not an affair of to-day, or yesterday--it is\nof very ancient date, and was very properly exposed nearly three\ncenturies ago by one Andrew Borde, who under the picture of a \"Naked man,\nwith a pair of shears in one hand, and a roll of cloth in the other,\" {3}\ninserted the following lines along with others:--\n\n   \"I am an Englishman, and naked I stand here,\n   Musing in my mind what garment I shall weare;\n   For now I will weare this, and now I will weare that,\n   Now I will weare, I cannot tell what.\n   All new fashions be pleasant to mee,\n   I will have them, whether I thrive or thee;\n   What do I care if all the world me fail?\n   I will have a garment reach to my taile;\n   Then am I a minion, for I wear the new guise.\n   The next yeare after I hope to be wise,\n   Not only in wearing my gorgeous array,\n   For I will go to learning a whole summer's day;\n   I will learn Latine, Hebrew, Greek, and French,\n   And I will learn Dutch, sitting on my bench.\n   I had no peere if to myself I were true,\n   Because I am not so, divers times do I rue.\n   Yet I lacke nothing, I have all things at will\n   If I were wise and would hold myself still,\n   And meddle with no matters but to me pertaining,\n   But ever to be true to God and my king.\n   But I have such matters rowling in my pate,\n   That I will and do--I cannot tell what,\" etc.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--On Gentility Nonsense--Illustrations of Gentility.\n\n\nWhat is gentility?  People in different stations in England--entertain\ndifferent ideas of what is genteel, {4} but it must be something\ngorgeous, glittering, or tawdry, to be considered genteel by any of them.\nThe beau-ideal of the English aristocracy, of course with some\nexceptions, is some young fellow with an imperial title, a military\npersonage of course, for what is military is so particularly genteel,\nwith flaming epaulets, a cocked hat and plume, a prancing charger, and a\nband of fellows called generals and colonels, with flaming epaulets,\ncocked hats and plumes, and prancing chargers vapouring behind him.  It\nwas but lately that the daughter of an English marquis was heard to say,\nthat the sole remaining wish of her heart--she had known misfortunes, and\nwas not far from fifty--was to be introduced to--whom?  The Emperor of\nAustria!  The sole remaining wish of the heart of one who ought to have\nbeen thinking of the grave and judgment, was to be introduced to the\nmiscreant who had caused the blood of noble Hungarian females to be\nwhipped out of their shoulders, for no other crime than devotion to their\ncountry, and its tall and heroic sons.  The middle classes--of course\nthere are some exceptions--admire the aristocracy, and consider them\npinks, the aristocracy who admire the Emperor of Austria, and adored the\nEmperor of Russia, till he became old, ugly, and unfortunate, when their\nadoration instantly terminated; for what is more ungenteel than age,\nugliness, and misfortune!  The beau-ideal with those of the lower\nclasses, with peasants and mechanics, is some flourishing railroad\ncontractor: look, for example, how they worship Mr. Flamson.  This person\nmakes his grand debut in the year 'thirty-nine, at a public meeting in\nthe principal room of a country inn.  He has come into the neighbourhood\nwith the character of a man worth a million pounds, who is to make\neverybody's fortune; at this time, however, he is not worth a shilling of\nhis own, though he flashes about dexterously three or four thousand\npounds, part of which sum he has obtained by specious pretences, and part\nfrom certain individuals who are his confederates.  But in the year\n'forty-nine, he is really in possession of the fortune which he and his\nagents pretended to be worth ten years before--he is worth a million\npounds.  By what means has he come by them?  By railroad contracts, for\nwhich he takes care to be paid in hard cash before he attempts to perform\nthem, and to carry out which he makes use of the sweat and blood of\nwretches who, since their organization, have introduced crimes and\nlanguage into England to which it was previously almost a stranger--by\npurchasing, with paper, shares by hundreds in the schemes to execute\nwhich he contracts, and which are his own devising; which shares he sells\nas soon as they are at a high premium, to which they are speedily forced\nby means of paragraphs, inserted by himself and agents, in newspapers\ndevoted to his interest, utterly reckless of the terrible depreciation to\nwhich they are almost instantly subjected.  But he is worth a million\npounds, there can be no doubt of the fact--he has not made people's\nfortunes, at least those whose fortunes it was said he would make; he has\nmade them away; but his own he has made, emphatically made it; he is\nworth a million pounds.  Hurrah for the millionnaire!  The clown who\nviews the pandemonium of red brick which he has built on the estate which\nhe has purchased in the neighbourhood of the place of his grand debut, in\nwhich every species of architecture, Greek, Indian, and Chinese, is\nemployed in caricature--who hears of the grand entertainment he gives at\nChristmas in the principal dining-room, the hundred wax-candles, the\nwaggon-load of plate, and the ocean of wine which form parts of it, and\nabove all the two ostrich poults, one at the head, and the other at the\nfoot of the table, exclaims, \"Well! if he a'n't bang up, I don't know who\nbe; why he beats my lord hollow!\"  The mechanic of the borough town, who\nsees him dashing through the streets in an open landau, drawn by four\nmilk-white horses, amidst his attendant out-riders; his wife, a monster\nof a woman, by his side, stout as the wife of Tamerlane, who weighed\ntwenty stone, and bedizened out like her whose person shone with the\njewels of plundered Persia, stares with silent wonder, and at last\nexclaims \"That's the man for my vote!\"  You tell the clown that the man\nof the mansion has contributed enormously to corrupt the rural innocence\nof England; you point to an incipient branch railroad, from around which\nthe accents of Gomorrah are sounding, and beg him to listen for a moment,\nand then close his ears.  Hodge scratches his head and says, \"Well, I\nhave nothing to say to that; all I know is, that he is bang up, and I\nwish I were he;\" perhaps he will add--a Hodge has been known to add--\"He\nhas been kind enough to put my son on that very railroad; 'tis true the\ncompany is somewhat queer, and the work rather killing, but he gets there\nhalf-a-crown a day, whereas from the farmers he would only get eighteen-\npence.\"  You remind the mechanic that the man in the landau has been the\nruin of thousands and you mention people whom he himself knows, people in\nvarious grades of life, widows and orphans amongst them, whose little all\nhas been dissipated, and whom he has reduced to beggary by inducing them\nto become sharers in his delusive schemes.  But the mechanic says, \"Well,\nthe more fools they to let themselves be robbed.  But I don't call that\nkind of thing robbery, I merely call it out-witting; and everybody in\nthis free country has a right to outwit others if he can.  What a turn-\nout he has!\"  One was once heard to add, \"I never saw a more\ngenteel-looking man in all my life except one, and that was a gentleman's\nwalley, who was much like him.  It is true that he is rather under-sized,\nbut then madam, you know, makes up for all.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--Subject of Gentility continued.\n\n\nIn the last chapter have been exhibited specimens of gentility, so\nconsidered by different classes; by one class power, youth, and epaulets\nare considered the ne plus ultra of gentility; by another class pride,\nstateliness, and title; by another, wealth and flaming tawdriness.  But\nwhat constitutes a gentleman?  It is easy to say at once what constitutes\na gentleman, and there are no distinctions in what is gentlemanly, {5} as\nthere are in what is genteel.  The characteristics of a gentleman are\nhigh feeling--a determination never to take a cowardly advantage of\nanother--a liberal education--absence of narrow views--generosity and\ncourage, propriety of behaviour.  Now a person may be genteel according\nto one or another of the three standards described above, and not possess\none of the characteristics of a gentleman.  Is the emperor a gentleman,\nwith spatters of blood on his clothes, scourged from the backs of noble\nHungarian women?  Are the aristocracy gentlefolks, who admire him?  Is\nMr. Flamson a gentleman, although he has a million pounds?  No! cowardly\nmiscreants, admirers of cowardly miscreants, and people who make a\nmillion pounds by means compared with which those employed to make\nfortunes by the getters up of the South Sea Bubble might be called honest\ndealing, are decidedly not gentlefolks.  Now as it is clearly\ndemonstrable that a person may be perfectly genteel according to some\nstandard or other, and yet be no gentleman, so it is demonstrable that a\nperson may have no pretensions to gentility, and yet be a gentleman.  For\nexample, there is Lavengro!  Would the admirers of the emperor, or the\nadmirers of those who admire the emperor, or the admirers of Mr. Flamson,\ncall him genteel? and gentility with them is everything!  Assuredly they\nwould not; and assuredly they would consider him respectively as a being\nto be shunned, despised, or hooted.  Genteel!  Why at one time he is a\nhack author--writes reviewals for eighteenpence a page--edits a Newgate\nchronicle.  At another he wanders the country with a face grimy from\noccasionally mending kettles; and there is no evidence that his clothes\nare not seedy and torn, and his shoes down at the heel; but by what\nprocess of reasoning will they prove that he is no gentleman?  Is he not\nlearned?  Has he not generosity and courage?  Whilst a hack author, does\nhe pawn the books entrusted to him to review?  Does he break his word to\nhis publisher?  Does he write begging letters?  Does he get clothes or\nlodgings without paying for them?  Again, whilst a wanderer, does he\ninsult helpless women on the road with loose proposals or ribald\ndiscourse?  Does he take what is not his own from the hedges?  Does he\nplay on the fiddle, or make faces in public-houses, in order to obtain\npence or beer? or does he call for liquor, swallow it, and then say to a\nwidowed landlady, \"Mistress, I have no brass?\"  In a word, what vice and\ncrime does he perpetrate--what low acts does he commit?  Therefore, with\nhis endowments, who will venture to say that he is no gentleman?--unless\nit be an admirer of Mr. Flamson--a clown--who will, perhaps, shout--\"I\nsay he is no gentleman; for who can be a gentleman who keeps no gig?\"\n\nThe indifference exhibited by Lavengro for what is merely genteel,\ncompared with his solicitude never to infringe the strict laws of honour,\nshould read a salutary lesson.  The generality of his countrymen are far\nmore careful not to transgress the customs of what they call gentility,\nthan to violate the laws of honour or morality.  They will shrink from\ncarrying their own carpet-bag, and from speaking to a person in seedy\nraiment, whilst to matters of much higher importance they are shamelessly\nindifferent.  Not so Lavengro; he will do anything that he deems\nconvenient, or which strikes his fancy, provided it does not outrage\ndecency, or is unallied to profligacy; is not ashamed to speak to a\nbeggar in rags, and will associate with anybody, provided he can gratify\na laudable curiosity.  He has no abstract love for what is low, or what\nthe world calls low.  He sees that many things which the world looks down\nupon are valuable, so he prizes much which the world condemns; he sees\nthat many things which the world admires are contemptible, so he despises\nmuch which the world does not; but when the world prizes what is really\nexcellent, he does not contemn it, because the world regards it.  If he\nlearns Irish, which all the world scoffs at, he likewise learns Italian,\nwhich all the world melts at.  If he learns Gypsy, the language of the\ntattered tent, he likewise learns Greek, the language of the\ncollege-hall.  If he learns smithery, he also learns--ah! what does he\nlearn to set against smithery?--the law?  No; he does not learn the law,\nwhich, by the way, is not very genteel.  Swimming?  Yes, he learns to\nswim.  Swimming, however, is not genteel; and the world--at least the\ngenteel part of it--acts very wisely in setting its face against it; for\nto swim you must be naked, and how would many a genteel person look\nwithout his clothes?  Come, he learns horsemanship; a very genteel\naccomplishment, which every genteel person would gladly possess, though\nnot all genteel people do.\n\nAgain as to associates: if he holds communion when a boy with Murtagh,\nthe scarecrow of an Irish academy, he associates in after life with\nFrancis Ardry, a rich and talented young Irish gentleman about town.  If\nhe accepts an invitation from Mr. Petulengro to his tent, he has no\nobjection to go home with a rich genius to dinner; who then will say that\nhe prizes a thing or a person because they are ungenteel?  That he is not\nready to take up with everything that is ungenteel he gives a proof, when\nhe refuses, though on the brink of starvation, to become bonnet to the\nthimble-man, an office, which, though profitable, is positively\nungenteel.  Ah! but some sticker-up for gentility will exclaim, \"The hero\ndid not refuse this office from an insurmountable dislike to its\nungentility, but merely from a feeling of principle.\"  Well! the writer\nis not fond of argument, and he will admit that such was the case; he\nadmits that it was a love of principle, rather than an over-regard for\ngentility, which prevented the hero from accepting, when on the brink of\nstarvation, an ungenteel though lucrative office, an office which, the\nwriter begs leave to observe, many a person with a great regard for\ngentility, and no particular regard for principle, would in a similar\nstrait have accepted; for when did a mere love for gentility keep a\nperson from being a dirty scoundrel, when the alternatives were \"either\nbe a dirty scoundrel or starve?\"  One thing, however, is certain, which\nis, that Lavengro did not accept the office, which if a love for what is\nlow had been his ruling passion he certainly would have done;\nconsequently, he refuses to do one thing which no genteel person would\nwillingly do, even as he does many things which every genteel person\nwould gladly do, for example, speaks Italian, rides on horseback,\nassociates with a fashionable young man, dines with a rich genius, et\ncetera.  Yet--and it cannot be minced--he and gentility with regard to\nmany things are at strange divergency; he shrinks from many things at\nwhich gentility placidly hums a tune, or approvingly simpers, and does\nsome things at which gentility positively shrinks.  He will not run into\ndebt for clothes or lodgings, which he might do without any scandal to\ngentility; he will not receive money from Francis Ardry, and go to\nBrighton with the sister of Annette Le Noir, though there is nothing\nungenteel in borrowing money from a friend, even when you never intend to\nrepay him, and something poignantly genteel in going to a watering-place\nwith a gay young Frenchwoman; but he has no objection, after raising\ntwenty pounds by the sale of that extraordinary work \"Joseph Sell,\" to\nset off into the country, mend kettles under hedge-rows, and make pony\nand donkey shoes in a dingle.  Here, perhaps, some plain, well-meaning\nperson will cry--and with much apparent justice--how can the writer\njustify him in this act?  What motive, save a love for what is low, could\ninduce him to do such a thing?  Would the writer have everybody who is in\nneed of recreation go into the country, mend kettles under hedges, and\nmake pony shoes in dingles?  To such an observation the writer would\nanswer, that Lavengro had an excellent motive in doing what he did, but\nthat the writer is not so unreasonable as to wish everybody to do the\nsame.  It is not everybody who can mend kettles.  It is not everybody who\nis in similar circumstances to those in which Lavengro was.  Lavengro\nflies from London and hack authorship, and takes to the roads from fear\nof consumption; it is expensive to put up at inns, and even at public-\nhouses, and Lavengro has not much money; so he buys a tinker's cart and\napparatus, and sets up as tinker, and subsequently as blacksmith; a\nperson living in a tent, or in anything else, must do something or go\nmad; Lavengro had a mind, as he himself well knew, with some slight\ntendency to madness, and had he not employed himself, he must have gone\nwild; so to employ himself he drew upon one of his resources, the only\none available at the time.  Authorship had nearly killed him, he was sick\nof reading, and had besides no books; but he possessed the rudiments of\nan art akin to tinkering; he knew something of smithery, having served a\nkind of apprenticeship in Ireland to a fairy smith; so he draws upon his\nsmithery to enable him to acquire tinkering, he speedily acquires that\ncraft, even as he had speedily acquired Welsh, owing to its connection\nwith Irish, which language he possessed; and with tinkering he amuses\nhimself until he lays it aside to resume smithery.  A man who has an\ninnocent resource, has quite as much right to draw upon it in need, as he\nhas upon a banker in whose hands he has placed a sum; Lavengro turns to\nadvantage, under particular circumstances, a certain resource which he\nhas, but people who are not so forlorn as Lavengro, and have not served\nthe same apprenticeship which he had, are not advised to follow his\nexample.  Surely he was better employed in plying the trades of tinker\nand smith than in having recourse to vice, in running after milk-maids,\nfor example.  Running after milk-maids is by no means an ungenteel rural\ndiversion; but let any one ask some respectable casuist (the Bishop of\nLondon for example), whether Lavengro was not far better employed, when\nin the country, at tinkering and smithery than he would have been in\nrunning after all the milk-maids in Cheshire, though tinkering is in\ngeneral considered a very ungenteel employment, and smithery little\nbetter, notwithstanding that an Orcadian poet, who wrote in Norse about\neight hundred years ago, reckons the latter among nine noble arts which\nhe possessed, naming it along with playing at chess, on the harp, and\nravelling runes, or as the original has it, \"treading runes\"--that is,\ncompressing them into a small compass by mingling one letter with\nanother, even as the Turkish caligraphists ravel the Arabic letters, more\nespecially those who write talismans.\n\n   \"Nine arts have I, all noble;\n   I play at chess so free,\n   At ravelling runes I'm ready,\n   At books and smithery;\n   I'm skilled o'er ice at skimming\n   On skates, I shoot and row,\n   And few at harping match me,\n   Or minstrelsy, I trow.\"\n\nBut though Lavengro takes up smithery, which, though the Orcadian ranks\nit with chess-playing and harping, is certainly somewhat of a grimy art,\nthere can be no doubt that, had he been wealthy and not so forlorn as he\nwas, he would have turned to many things, honourable, of course, in\npreference.  He has no objection to ride a fine horse when he has the\nopportunity: he has his day-dream of making a fortune of two hundred\nthousand pounds by becoming a merchant and doing business after the\nArmenian fashion; and there can be no doubt that he would have been glad\nto wear fine clothes, provided he had had sufficient funds to authorize\nhim in wearing them.  For the sake of wandering the country and plying\nthe hammer and tongs, he would not have refused a commission in the\nservice of that illustrious monarch George the Fourth, provided he had\nthought that he could live on his pay, and not be forced to run in debt\nto tradesmen, without any hope of paying them, for clothes and luxuries,\nas many highly genteel officers in that honourable service were in the\nhabit of doing.  For the sake of tinkering, he would certainly not have\nrefused a secretaryship of an embassy to Persia, in which he might have\nturned his acquaintance with Persian, Arabic, and the Lord only knows\nwhat other languages, to account.  He took to tinkering and smithery,\nbecause no better employments were at his command.  No war is waged in\nthe book against rank, wealth, fine clothes, or dignified employments; it\nis shown, however, that a person may be a gentleman and a scholar without\nthem.  Rank, wealth, fine clothes, and dignified employments, are no\ndoubt very fine things, but they are merely externals, they do not make a\ngentleman, they add external grace and dignity to the gentleman and\nscholar, but they make neither; and is it not better to be a gentleman\nwithout them than not a gentleman with them?  Is not Lavengro, when he\nleaves London on foot with twenty pounds in his pocket, entitled to more\nrespect than Mr. Flamson flaming in his coach with a million?  And is not\neven the honest jockey at Horncastle, who offers a fair price to Lavengro\nfor his horse, entitled to more than the scoundrel lord, who attempts to\ncheat him of one-fourth of its value?\n\nMillions, however, seem to think otherwise, by their servile adoration of\npeople whom without rank, wealth, and fine clothes they would consider\ninfamous, but whom possessed of rank, wealth, and glittering habiliments\nthey seem to admire all the more for their profligacy and crimes.  Does\nnot a blood-spot, or a lust-spot, on the clothes of a blooming emperor,\ngive a kind of zest to the genteel young god?  Do not the pride,\nsuperciliousness, and selfishness of a certain aristocracy make it all\nthe more regarded by its worshippers? and do not the clownish and gutter-\nblood admirers of Mr. Flamson like him all the more because they are\nconscious that he is a knave?  If such is the case --and, alas! is it not\nthe case?--they cannot be too frequently told that fine clothes, wealth,\nand titles adorn a person in proportion as he adorns them; that if worn\nby the magnanimous and good they are ornaments indeed, but if by the vile\nand profligate they are merely san benitos, and only serve to make their\ninfamy doubly apparent; and that a person in seedy raiment and tattered\nhat, possessed of courage, kindness, and virtue, is entitled to more\nrespect from those to whom his virtues are manifested than any cruel\nprofligate emperor, selfish aristocrat, or knavish millionaire in the\nworld.\n\nThe writer has no intention of saying that all in England are affected\nwith the absurd mania for gentility; nor is such a statement made in the\nbook; it is shown therein that individuals of certain classes can prize a\ngentleman, notwithstanding seedy raiment, dusty shoes or tattered\nhat,--for example, the young Irishman, the rich genius, the postillion,\nand his employer.  Again, when the life of the hero is given to the\nworld, amidst the howl about its lowness and vulgarity, raised by the\nservile crew whom its independence of sentiment has stung, more than one\npowerful voice has been heard testifying approbation of its learning and\nthe purity of its morality.  That there is some salt in England, minds\nnot swayed by mere externals, he is fully convinced; if he were not, he\nwould spare himself the trouble of writing; but to the fact that the\ngenerality of his countrymen are basely grovelling before the shrine of\nwhat they are pleased to call gentility, he cannot shut his eyes.\n\nOh! what a clever person that Cockney was, who, travelling in the\nAberdeen railroad carriage, after edifying the company with his remarks\non various subjects, gave it as his opinion that Lieutenant P--- would,\nin future, be shunned by all respectable society!  And what a simple\nperson that elderly gentleman was, who, abruptly starting, asked in\nrather an authoritative voice, \"and why should Lieutenant P--- be shunned\nby respectable society?\" and who, after entering into what was said to be\na masterly analysis of the entire evidence of the case, concluded by\nstating, \"that having been accustomed to all kinds of evidence all his\nlife, he had never known a case in which the accused had obtained a more\ncomplete and triumphant justification than Lieutenant P--- had done in\nthe late trial.\"\n\nNow the Cockney, who is said to have been a very foppish Cockney, was\nperfectly right in what he said, and therein manifested a knowledge of\nthe English mind and character, and likewise of the modern English\nlanguage, to which his catechist, who, it seems, was a distinguished\nmember of the Scottish bar, could lay no pretensions.  The Cockney knew\nwhat the Lord of Session knew not, that the British public is gentility\ncrazy, and he knew, moreover, that gentility and respectability are\nsynonymous.  No one in England is genteel or respectable that is \"looked\nat,\" who is the victim of oppression; he may be pitied for a time, but\nwhen did not pity terminate in contempt?  A poor, harmless young\nofficer--but why enter into the details of the infamous case? they are\nbut too well known, and if ever cruelty, pride, and cowardice, and things\nmuch worse than even cruelty, cowardice, and pride were brought to light,\nand, at the same time, countenanced, they were in that case.  What\navailed the triumphant justification of the poor victim?  There was at\nfirst a roar of indignation against his oppressors, but how long did it\nlast?  He had been turned out of the service, they remained in it with\ntheir red coats and epaulets; he was merely the son of a man who had\nrendered good service to his country, they were, for the most part,\nhighly connected--they were in the extremest degree genteel, he quite the\nreverse; so the nation wavered, considered, thought the genteel side was\nthe safest after all, and then with the cry of, \"Oh! there is nothing\nlike gentility,\" ratted bodily.  Newspaper and public turned against the\nvictim, scouted him, apologized for the--what should they be called?--who\nwere not only admitted into the most respectable society, but courted to\ncome, the spots not merely of wine on their military clothes, giving them\na kind of poignancy.  But there is a God in heaven; the British glories\nare tarnished--Providence has never smiled on British arms since that\ncase--oh!  Balaklava! thy name interpreted is net of fishes, and well\ndost thou deserve that name.  How many a scarlet golden fish has of late\nperished in the mud amidst thee, cursing the genteel service, and the\ngenteel leader which brought him to such a doom.\n\nWhether the rage for gentility is most prevalent amongst the upper,\nmiddle, or lower classes it is difficult to say; the priest in the text\nseems to think that it is exhibited in the most decided manner in the\nmiddle class; it is the writer's opinion, however, that in no class is it\nmore strongly developed than in the lower: what they call being well-born\ngoes a great way amongst them, but the possession of money much farther,\nwhence Mr. Flamson's influence over them.  Their rage against, and scorn\nfor, any person who by his courage and talents has advanced himself in\nlife, and still remains poor, are indescribable; \"he is no better than\nourselves,\" they say, \"why should he be above us?\"--for they have no\nconception that anybody has a right to ascendency over themselves except\nby birth or money.  This feeling amongst the vulgar has been, to a\ncertain extent, the bane of two services, naval and military.  The writer\ndoes not make this assertion rashly; he observed this feeling at work in\nthe army when a child, and he has good reason for believing that it was\nas strongly at work in the navy at the same time, and is still as\nprevalent in both.  Why are not brave men raised from the ranks? is\nfrequently the cry; why are not brave sailors promoted?  The Lord help\nbrave soldiers and sailors who are promoted; they have less to undergo\nfrom the high airs of their brother officers, and those are hard enough\nto endure, than from the insolence of the men.  Soldiers and sailors\npromoted to command are said to be in general tyrants; in nine cases out\nof ten, when they are tyrants, they have been obliged to have recourse to\nextreme severity in order to protect themselves from the insolence and\nmutinous spirit of the men,--\"He is no better than ourselves: shoot him,\nbayonet him, or fling him overboard!\" they say of some obnoxious\nindividual raised above them by his merit.  Soldiers and sailors, in\ngeneral, will bear any amount of tyranny from a lordly sot, or the son of\na man who has \"plenty of brass\"--their own term--but will mutiny against\nthe just orders of a skilful and brave officer who \"is no better than\nthemselves.\"  There was the affair of the \"Bounty,\" for example: Bligh\nwas one of the best seamen that ever trod deck, and one of the bravest of\nmen; proofs of his seamanship he gave by steering, amidst dreadful\nweather, a deeply-laden boat for nearly four thousand miles over an\nalmost unknown ocean--of his bravery, at the fight of Copenhagen, one of\nthe most desperate ever fought, of which after Nelson he was the hero: he\nwas, moreover, not an unkind man; but the crew of the \"Bounty\" mutinied\nagainst him, and set him half naked in an open boat, with certain of his\nmen who remained faithful to him, and ran away with the ship.  Their\nprincipal motive for doing so was an idea, whether true or groundless the\nwriter cannot say, that Bligh was \"no better than themselves;\" he was\ncertainly neither a lord's illegitimate, nor possessed of twenty thousand\npounds.  The writer knows what he is writing about, having been\nacquainted in his early years with an individual who was turned adrift\nwith Bligh, and who died about the year '22, a lieutenant in the navy, in\na provincial town in which the writer was brought up.  The ringleaders in\nthe mutiny were two scoundrels, Christian and Young, who had great\ninfluence with the crew, because they were genteelly connected.  Bligh,\nafter leaving the \"Bounty,\" had considerable difficulty in managing the\nmen who had shared his fate, because they considered themselves \"as good\nmen as he,\" notwithstanding, that to his conduct and seamanship they had\nalone to look, under Heaven, for salvation from the ghastly perils that\nsurrounded them.  Bligh himself, in his journal, alludes to this feeling.\nOnce, when he and his companions landed on a desert island, one of them\nsaid, with a mutinous look, that he considered himself \"as good a man as\nhe;\" Bligh, seizing a cutlass, called upon him to take another and defend\nhimself, whereupon the man said that Bligh was going to kill him, and\nmade all manner of concessions; now why did this fellow consider himself\nas good a man as Bligh?  Was he as good a seaman? no, nor a tenth part as\ngood.  As brave a man? no, nor a tenth part as brave; and of these facts\nhe was perfectly well aware, but bravery and seamanship stood for nothing\nwith him, as they still stand with thousands of his class; Bligh was not\ngenteel by birth or money, therefore Bligh was no better than himself.\nHad Bligh, before he sailed, got a twenty-thousand pound prize in the\nlottery, he would have experienced no insolence from this fellow, for\nthere would have been no mutiny in the \"Bounty.\"  \"He is our betters,\"\nthe crew would have said, \"and it is our duty to obey him.\"\n\nThe wonderful power of gentility in England is exemplified in nothing\nmore than in what it is producing amongst Jews, Gypsies, and Quakers.  It\nis breaking up their venerable communities.  All the better, some one\nwill say.  Alas! alas!  It is making the wealthy Jews forsake the\nsynagogue for the opera-house, or the gentility chapel, in which a\ndisciple of Mr. Platitude, in a white surplice, preaches a sermon at noon-\nday from a desk, on each side of which is a flaming taper.  It is making\nthem abandon their ancient literature, their \"Mischna,\" their \"Gemara,\"\ntheir \"Zohar,\" for gentility novels, \"The Young Duke,\" the most\nunexceptionably genteel book ever written, being the principal favourite.\nIt makes the young Jew ashamed of the young Jewess, it makes her ashamed\nof the young Jew.  The young Jew marries an opera-dancer, or if the\ndancer will not have him, as is frequently the case, the cast-off Miss of\nthe Honourable Spencer So-and-so.  It makes the young Jewess accept the\nhonourable offer of a cashiered lieutenant of the Bengal Native Infantry;\nor, if such a person does not come forward, the dishonourable offer of a\ncornet of a regiment of crack hussars.  It makes poor Jews, male and\nfemale, forsake the synagogue for the sixpenny theatre or penny hop; the\nJew to take up with an Irish female of loose character, and the Jewess\nwith a musician of the Guards, or the Tipperary servant of Captain\nMulligan.  With respect to the gypsies, it is making the women what they\nnever were before--harlots; and the men what they never were\nbefore--careless fathers and husbands.  It has made the daughter of\nUrsula the chaste take up with the base drummer of a wild-beast show.  It\nmakes Gorgiko Brown, the gypsy man, leave his tent and his old wife, of\nan evening, and thrust himself into society which could well dispense\nwith him.  \"Brother,\" said Mr. Petulengro to the Romany Rye, after\ntelling him many things connected with the decadence of gypsyism, \"there\nis one Gorgiko Brown, who, with a face as black as a tea-kettle, wishes\nto be mistaken for a Christian tradesman; he goes into the parlour of a\nthird-rate inn of an evening, calls for rum and water, and attempts to\nenter into conversation with the company about politics and business; the\ncompany flout him and give him the cold shoulder, or perhaps complain to\nthe landlord, who comes and asks him what business he has in the parlour,\ntelling him if he wants to drink to go into the tap-room, and perhaps\ncollars him and kicks him out, provided he refuses to move.\"  With\nrespect to the Quakers, it makes the young people like the young Jews,\ncrazy after gentility diversions, worship, marriages, or connections, and\nmakes old Pease do what it makes Gorgiko Brown do, thrust himself into\nsociety which could well dispense with him, and out of which he is not\nkicked, because unlike the gypsy he is not poor.  The writer would say\nmuch more on these points, but want of room prevents him; he must\ntherefore request the reader to have patience until he can lay before the\nworld a pamphlet, which he has been long meditating, to be entitled\n\"Remarks on the strikingly similar Effects which a Love for Gentility has\nproduced, and is producing, amongst Jews, Gypsies, and Quakers.\"\n\nThe Priest in the book has much to say on the subject of this gentility-\nnonsense; no person can possibly despise it more thoroughly than that\nvery remarkable individual seems to do, yet he hails its prevalence with\npleasure, knowing the benefits which will result from it to the church of\nwhich he is the sneering slave.  \"The English are mad after gentility,\"\nsays he; \"well, all the better for us; their religion for a long time\npast has been a plain and simple one, and consequently by no means\ngenteel; they'll quit it for ours, which is the perfection of what they\nadmire; with which Templars, Hospitalers, mitred abbots, Gothic abbeys,\nlong-drawn aisles, golden censers, incense, et cetera, are connected;\nnothing, or next to nothing, of Christ, it is true, but weighed in the\nbalance against gentility, where will Christianity be? why, kicking\nagainst the beam--ho! ho!\"  And in connection with the\ngentility-nonsense, he expatiates largely, and with much contempt, on a\nspecies of literature by which the interests of his church in England\nhave been very much advanced--all genuine priests have a thorough\ncontempt for everything which tends to advance the interests of their\nchurch--this literature is made up of pseudo Jacobitism, Charlie o'er the\nwaterism, or nonsense about Charlie o'er the water.  And the writer will\nnow take the liberty of saying a few words about it on his own account.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--On Scotch Gentility-Nonsense--Charlie o'er the Waterism.\n\n\nOf the literature just alluded to Scott was the inventor.  It is founded\non the fortunes and misfortunes of the Stuart family, of which Scott was\nthe zealous defender and apologist, doing all that in his power lay to\nrepresent the members of it as noble, chivalrous, high-minded,\nunfortunate princes; though, perhaps, of all the royal families that ever\nexisted upon the earth, this family was the worst.  It was unfortunate\nenough, it is true; but it owed its misfortunes entirely to its crimes,\nviciousness, bad faith, and cowardice.  Nothing will be said of it here\nuntil it made its appearance in England to occupy the English throne.\n\nThe first of the family which we have to do with, James, was a dirty,\ncowardly miscreant, of whom the less said the better.  His son, Charles\nthe First, was a tyrant--exceedingly cruel and revengeful, but weak and\ndastardly; he caused a poor fellow to be hanged in London, who was not\nhis subject, because he had heard that the unfortunate creature had once\nbitten his own glove at Cadiz, in Spain, at the mention of his name; and\nhe permitted his own bull-dog, Strafford, to be executed by his own\nenemies, though the only crime of Strafford was, that he had barked\nfuriously at those enemies, and had worried two or three of them, when\nCharles shouted, \"Fetch 'em.\"  He was a bitter, but yet a despicable\nenemy, and the coldest and most worthless of friends; for though he\nalways hoped to be able, some time or other, to hang his enemies, he was\nalways ready to curry favour with them, more especially if he could do so\nat the expense of his friends.  He was the haughtiest, yet meanest of\nmankind.  He once caned a young nobleman for appearing before him in the\ndrawing-room not dressed exactly according to the court etiquette; yet he\ncondescended to flatter and compliment him who, from principle, was his\nbitterest enemy, namely, Harrison, when the republican colonel was\nconducting him as a prisoner to London.  His bad faith was notorious; it\nwas from abhorrence of the first public instance which he gave of his bad\nfaith, his breaking his word to the Infanta of Spain, that the poor\nHiberno-Spaniard bit his glove at Cadiz; and it was his notorious bad\nfaith which eventually cost him his head; for the Republicans would\ngladly have spared him, provided they could put the slightest confidence\nin any promise, however solemn, which he might have made to them.  Of\nthem, it would be difficult to say whether they most hated or despised\nhim.  Religion he had none.  One day he favoured Popery; the next, on\nhearing certain clamours of the people, he sent his wife's domestics back\npacking to France, because they were Papists.  Papists, however, should\nmake him a saint, for he was certainly the cause of the taking of\nRochelle.\n\nHis son, Charles the Second, though he passed his youth in the school of\nadversity, learned no other lesson from it than the following one--take\ncare of yourself, and never do an action, either good or bad, which is\nlikely to bring you into any great difficulty; and this maxim he acted up\nto as soon as he came to the throne.  He was a Papist, but took especial\ncare not to acknowledge his religion, at which he frequently scoffed,\ntill just before his last gasp, when he knew that he could lose nothing,\nand hoped to gain everything by it.  He was always in want of money, but\ntook care not to tax the country beyond all endurable bounds; preferring\nto such a bold and dangerous course, to become the pensioner of Louis, to\nwhom, in return for his gold, he sacrificed the honour and interests of\nBritain.  He was too lazy and sensual to delight in playing the part of a\ntyrant himself; but he never checked tyranny in others save in one\ninstance.  He permitted beastly butchers to commit unmentionable horrors\non the feeble, unarmed, and disunited Covenanters of Scotland, but\nchecked them when they would fain have endeavoured to play the same game\non the numerous united, dogged, and warlike Independents of England.  To\nshow his filial piety, he bade the hangman dishonour the corpses of some\nof his father's judges, before whom, when alive, he ran like a screaming\nhare; but permitted those who had lost their all in supporting his\nfather's cause, to pine in misery and want.  He would give to a painted\nharlot a thousand pounds for a loathsome embrace, and to a player or\nbuffoon a hundred for a trumpery pun, but would refuse a penny to the\nwidow or orphan of an old Royalist soldier.  He was the personification\nof selfishness; and as he loved and cared for no one, so did no one love\nor care for him.  So little had he gained the respect or affection of\nthose who surrounded him, that after his body had undergone an\nafter-death examination, parts of it were thrown down the sinks of the\npalace, to become eventually the prey of the swine and ducks of\nWestminster.\n\nHis brother, who succeeded him, James the Second, was a Papist, but\nsufficiently honest to acknowledge his Popery, but upon the whole, he was\na poor creature; though a tyrant, he was cowardly, had he not been a\ncoward he would never have lost his throne.  There were plenty of lovers\nof tyranny in England who would have stood by him, provided he would have\nstood by them, and would, though not Papists, have encouraged him in his\nattempt to bring back England beneath the sway of Rome, and perhaps would\neventually have become Papists themselves; but the nation raising a cry\nagainst him, and his son-in-law, the Prince of Orange, invading the\ncountry, he forsook his friends, of whom he had a host, but for whom he\ncared little--left his throne, for which he cared a great deal--and\nPopery in England, for which he cared yet more, to their fate, and\nescaped to France, from whence, after taking a little heart, he repaired\nto Ireland, where he was speedily joined by a gallant army of Papists\nwhom he basely abandoned at the Boyne, running away in a most lamentable\ncondition, at the time when by showing a little courage he might have\nenabled them to conquer.  This worthy, in his last will, bequeathed his\nheart to England--his right arm to Scotland--and his bowels to Ireland.\nWhat the English and Scotch said to their respective bequests is not\nknown, but it is certain that an old Irish priest, supposed to have been\na great-grand-uncle of the present Reverend Father Murtagh, on hearing of\nthe bequest to Ireland, fell into a great passion, and having been\nbrought up at \"Paris and Salamanca,\" expressed his indignation in the\nfollowing strain:--\"Malditas sean tus tripas! teniamos bastante del olor\nde tus tripas al tiempo de tu nuida dela batalla del Boyne!\"\n\nHis son, generally called the Old Pretender, though born in England, was\ncarried in his infancy to France, where he was brought up in the\nstrictest principles of Popery, which principles, however, did not\nprevent him becoming (when did they ever prevent any one?) a worthless\nand profligate scoundrel; there are some doubts as to the reality of his\nbeing a son of James, which doubts are probably unfounded, the grand\nproof of his legitimacy being the thorough baseness of his character.  It\nwas said of his father that he could speak well, and it may be said of\nhim that he could write well, the only thing he could do which was worth\ndoing, always supposing that there is any merit in being able to write.\nHe was of a mean appearance, and, like his father, pusillanimous to a\ndegree.  The meanness of his appearance disgusted, and his pusillanimity\ndiscouraged the Scotch when he made his appearance amongst them in the\nyear 1715, some time after the standard of rebellion had been hoisted by\nMar.  He only stayed a short time in Scotland, and then, seized with\npanic, retreated to France, leaving his friends to shift for themselves\nas they best could.  He died a pensioner of the Pope.\n\nThe son of this man, Charles Edward, of whom so much in later years has\nbeen said and written, was a worthless ignorant youth, and a profligate\nand illiterate old man.  When young, the best that can be said of him is,\nthat he had occasionally springs of courage, invariably at the wrong time\nand place, which merely served to lead his friends into inextricable\ndifficulties.  When old, he was loathsome and contemptible to both friend\nand foe.  His wife loathed him, and for the most terrible of reasons; she\ndid not pollute his couch, for to do that was impossible--he had made it\nso vile; but she betrayed it, inviting to it not only Alfieri the Filthy,\nbut the coarsest grooms.  Doctor King, the warmest and almost last\nadherent of his family, said, that there was not a vice or crime of which\nhe was not guilty; as for his foes, they scorned to harm him even when in\ntheir power.  In the year 1745 he came down from the Highlands of\nScotland, which had long been a focus of rebellion.  He was attended by\ncertain clans of the Highlands, desperadoes used to free-bootery from\ntheir infancy, and, consequently, to the use of arms, and possessed of a\ncertain species of discipline; with these he defeated at Prestonpans a\nbody of men called soldiers, but who were in reality peasants and\nartizans, levied about a month before, without discipline or confidence\nin each other, and who were miserably massacred by the Highland army; he\nsubsequently invaded England, nearly destitute of regular soldiers, and\npenetrated as far as Derby, from which place he retreated on learning\nthat regular forces which had been hastily recalled from Flanders were\ncoming against him, with the Duke of Cumberland at their head; he was\npursued, and his rearguard overtaken and defeated by the dragoons of the\nduke at Clifton, from which place the rebels retreated in great confusion\nacross the Eden into Scotland, where they commenced dancing Highland\nreels and strathspeys on the bank of the river, for joy at their escape,\nwhilst a number of wretched girls, paramours of some of them, were\nperishing in the waters of the swollen river in an attempt to follow\nthem; they themselves passed over by eighties and by hundreds, arm in\narm, for mutual safety, without the loss of a man, but they left the poor\nparamours to shift for themselves, nor did any of these canny people\nafter passing the stream dash back to rescue a single female life,--no,\nthey were too well employed upon the bank in dancing strathspeys to the\ntune of \"Charlie o'er the water.\"  It was, indeed, Charlie o'er the\nwater, and canny Highlanders o'er the water, but where were the poor\nprostitutes meantime?  _In the water_.\n\nThe Jacobite farce, or tragedy, was speedily brought to a close by the\nbattle of Culloden; there did Charlie wish himself back again o'er the\nwater, exhibiting the most unmistakable signs of pusillanimity; there\nwere the clans cut to pieces, at least those who could be brought to the\ncharge, and there fell Giles Mac Bean, or as he was called in Gaelic,\nGiliosa Mac Beathan, a kind of giant, six feet four inches and a quarter\nhigh, \"than whom,\" as his wife said in a coronach she made upon him, \"no\nman who stood at Cuiloitr was taller\"--Giles Mac Bean the Major of the\nclan Cattan--a great drinker--a great fisher--a great shooter, and the\nchampion of the Highland host.\n\nThe last of the Stuarts was a cardinal.\n\nSuch were the Stuarts, such their miserable history.  They were dead and\nburied in every sense of the word until Scott resuscitated them--how? by\nthe power of fine writing and by calling to his aid that strange\ndivinity, gentility.  He wrote splendid novels about the Stuarts, in\nwhich he represents them as unlike what they really were as the graceful\nand beautiful papillon is unlike the hideous and filthy worm.  In a word,\nhe made them genteel, and that was enough to give them paramount sway\nover the minds of the British people.  The public became Stuart-mad, and\neverybody, specially the women, said, \"What a pity it was that we hadn't\na Stuart to govern.\"  All parties, Whig, Tory, or Radical, became\nJacobite at heart, and admirers of absolute power.  The Whigs talked\nabout the liberty of the subject, and the Radicals about the rights of\nman still, but neither party cared a straw for what it talked about, and\nmentally swore that, as soon as by means of such stuff they could get\nplaces, and fill their pockets, they would be as Jacobite as the Jacobs\nthemselves.  As for Tories, no great change in them was necessary;\neverything favouring absolutism and slavery being congenial to them.  So\nthe whole nation, that is, the reading part of the nation, with some\nexceptions, for thank God there has always been some salt in England,\nwent over the water to Charlie.  But going over to Charlie was not\nenough, they must, or at least a considerable part of them, go over to\nRome too, or have a hankering to do so.  As the Priest sarcastically\nobserves in the text, \"As all the Jacobs were Papists, so the good folks\nwho through Scott's novels admire the Jacobs must be Papists too.\"  An\nidea got about that the religion of such genteel people as the Stuarts\nmust be the climax of gentility, and that idea was quite sufficient.  Only\nlet a thing, whether temporal or spiritual, be considered genteel in\nEngland, and if it be not followed it is strange indeed; so Scott's\nwritings not only made the greater part of the nation Jacobite, but\nPopish.\n\nHere some people will exclaim--whose opinions remain sound and\nuncontaminated--what you say is perhaps true with respect to the Jacobite\nnonsense at present so prevalent being derived from Scott's novels, but\nthe Popish nonsense, which people of the genteeler classes are so fond\nof, is derived from Oxford.  We sent our sons to Oxford nice honest lads,\neducated in the principles of the Church of England, and at the end of\nthe first term they came home puppies, talking Popish nonsense, which\nthey had learned from the pedants to whose care we had entrusted them;\nay, not only Popery but Jacobitism, which they hardly carried with them\nfrom home, for we never heard them talking Jacobitism before they had\nbeen at Oxford; but now their conversation is a farrago of Popish and\nJacobite stuff--\"Complines and Claverse.\"  Now, what these honest folks\nsay is, to a certain extent, founded on fact; the Popery which has\noverflowed the land during the last fourteen or fifteen years, has come\nimmediately from Oxford, and likewise some of the Jacobitism, Popish and\nJacobite nonsense, and little or nothing else, having been taught at\nOxford for about that number of years.  But whence did the pedants get\nthe Popish nonsense with which they have corrupted youth?  Why, from the\nsame quarter from which they got the Jacobite nonsense with which they\nhave inoculated those lads who were not inoculated with it before--Scott's\nnovels.  Jacobitism and Laudism, a kind of half Popery, had at one time\nbeen very prevalent at Oxford, but both had been long consigned to\noblivion there, and people at Oxford cared as little about Laud as they\ndid about the Pretender.  Both were dead and buried there, as everywhere\nelse, till Scott called them out of their graves, when the pedants of\nOxford hailed both--ay, and the Pope, too, as soon as Scott had made the\nold fellow fascinating, through particular novels, more especially the\n\"Monastery\" and \"Abbot.\"  Then the quiet, respectable, honourable Church\nof England would no longer do for the pedants of Oxford; they must belong\nto a more genteel church--they were ashamed at first to be downright\nRomans--so they would be Lauds.  The pale-looking, but exceedingly\ngenteel non-juring clergyman in Waverley was a Laud; but they soon became\ntired of being Lauds, for Laud's Church, gew-gawish and idolatrous as it\nwas, was not sufficiently tinselly and idolatrous for them, so they must\nbe Popes, but in a sneaking way, still calling themselves\nChurch-of-England men, in order to batten on the bounty of the church\nwhich they were betraying, and likewise have opportunities of corrupting\nsuch lads as might still resort to Oxford with principles uncontaminated.\n\nSo the respectable people, whose opinions are still sound, are, to a\ncertain extent, right when they say that the tide of Popery, which has\nflowed over the land, has come from Oxford.  It did come immediately from\nOxford, but how did it get to Oxford?  Why, from Scott's novels.  Oh!\nthat sermon which was the first manifestation of Oxford feeling, preached\nat Oxford some time in the year '38 by a divine of a weak and confused\nintellect, in which Popery was mixed up with Jacobitism!  The present\nwriter remembers perfectly well, on reading some extracts from it at the\ntime in a newspaper, on the top of a coach, exclaiming--\"Why, the\nsimpleton has been pilfering from Walter Scott's novels!\"\n\nO Oxford pedants!  Oxford pedants! ye whose politics and religion are\nboth derived from Scott's novels! what a pity it is that some lad of\nhonest parents, whose mind ye are endeavouring to stultify with your\nnonsense about \"Complines and Claverse,\" has not the spirit to start up\nand cry, \"Confound your gibberish!  I'll have none of it.  Hurrah for the\nChurch, and the principles of my _father_!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--Same Subject continued.\n\n\nNow what could have induced Scott to write novels tending to make people\nPapists and Jacobites, and in love with arbitrary power?  Did he think\nthat Christianity was a gaudy mummery?  He did not, he could not, for he\nhad read the Bible; yet was he fond of gaudy mummeries, fond of talking\nabout them.  Did he believe that the Stuarts were a good family, and fit\nto govern a country like Britain?  He knew that they were a vicious,\nworthless crew, and that Britain was a degraded country as long as they\nswayed the sceptre; but for those facts he cared nothing, they governed\nin a way which he liked, for he had an abstract love of despotism, and an\nabhorrence of everything savouring of freedom and the rights of man in\ngeneral.  His favourite political picture was a joking, profligate,\ncareless king, nominally absolute--the heads of great houses paying court\nto, but in reality governing, that king, whilst revelling with him on the\nplunder of a nation, and a set of crouching, grovelling vassals (the\nliteral meaning of vassal is a wretch), who, after allowing themselves to\nbe horsewhipped, would take a bone if flung to them, and be grateful; so\nthat in love with mummery, though he knew what Christianity was, no\nwonder he admired such a church as that of Rome, and that which Laud set\nup; and by nature formed to be the holder of the candle to ancient worm-\neaten and profligate families, no wonder that all his sympathies were\nwith the Stuarts and their dissipated insolent party, and all his hatred\ndirected against those who endeavoured to check them in their\nproceedings, and to raise the generality of mankind something above a\nstate of vassalage, that is, wretchedness.  Those who were born great,\nwere, if he could have had his will, always to remain great, however\nworthless their characters.  Those who were born low, were always to\nremain so, however great their talents; though, if that rule were carried\nout, where would he have been himself?\n\nIn the book which he called the \"History of Napoleon Bonaparte,\" in which\nhe plays the sycophant to all the legitimate crowned heads in Europe,\nwhatever their crimes, vices, or miserable imbecilities, he, in his\nabhorrence of everything low which by its own vigour makes itself\nillustrious, calls Murat of the sabre the son of a pastry-cook, of a\nMarseilleise pastry-cook.  It is a pity that people who give themselves\nhoity-toity airs--and the Scotch in general are wonderfully addicted to\ngiving themselves hoity-toity airs, and checking people better than\nthemselves with their birth {6} and their country--it is a great pity\nthat such people do not look at home-son of a pastry-cook, of a\nMarseilleise pastry-cook!  Well, and what was Scott himself?  Why, son of\na pettifogger, of an Edinburgh pettifogger.  \"Oh, but Scott was descended\nfrom the old cow-stealers of Buccleuch, and therefore--\" descended from\nold cow-stealers, was he?  Well, had he nothing to boast of beyond such a\npedigree, he would have lived and died the son of a pettifogger, and been\nforgotten, and deservedly so; but he possessed talents, and by his\ntalents rose like Murat, and like him will be remembered for his talents\nalone, and deservedly so.  \"Yes, but Murat was still the son of a pastry-\ncook, and though he was certainly good at the sabre, and cut his way to a\nthrone, still--\"  Lord! what fools there are in the world; but as no one\ncan be thought anything of in this world without a pedigree, the writer\nwill now give a pedigree for Murat, of a very different character from\nthe cow-stealing one of Scott, but such a one as the proudest he might\nnot disdain to claim.  Scott was descended from the old cow-stealers of\nBuccleuch--was he?  Good! and Murat was descended from the old Moors of\nSpain, from the Abencerages (sons of the saddle) of Granada.  The name\nMurat is Arabic, and is the same as Murad (Le Desire, or the wished-for\none).  Scott in his genteel Life of Bonaparte, says that \"when Murat was\nin Egypt, the similarity between the name of the celebrated Mameluke\nMourad and that of Bonaparte's Meilleur Sabreur was remarked, and became\nthe subject of jest amongst the comrades of the gallant Frenchman.\"  But\nthe writer of the novel of Bonaparte did not know that the names were one\nand the same.  Now which was the best pedigree, that of the son of the\npastry-cook, or that of the son of the pettifogger?  Which was the best\nblood?  Let us observe the workings of the two bloods.  He who had the\nblood of the \"sons of the saddle\" in him, became the wonderful cavalier\nof the most wonderful host that ever went forth to conquest, won for\nhimself a crown, and died the death of a soldier, leaving behind him a\nson, only inferior to himself in strength, in prowess, and in\nhorsemanship.  The descendant of the cow-stealer became a poet, a novel\nwriter, the panegyrist of great folk and genteel people; became insolvent\nbecause, though an author, he deemed it ungenteel to be mixed up with the\nbusiness part of the authorship; died paralytic and broken-hearted\nbecause he could no longer give entertainments to great folks, leaving\nbehind him, amongst other children, who were never heard of, a son, who,\nthrough his father's interest, had become lieutenant-colonel in a genteel\ncavalry regiment.  A son who was ashamed of his father because his father\nwas an author; a son who--paugh--why ask which was the best blood?\n\nSo, owing to his rage for gentility, Scott must needs become the\napologist of the Stuarts and their party; but God made this man pay\ndearly for taking the part of the wicked against the good; for lauding up\nto the skies the miscreants and robbers, and calumniating the noble\nspirits of Britain, the salt of England, and his own country.  As God had\ndriven the Stuarts from their throne, and their followers from their\nestates, making them vagabonds and beggars on the face of the earth,\ntaking from them all that they cared for, so did that same God, who knows\nperfectly well how and where to strike, deprive the apologist of that\nwretched crew of all that rendered life pleasant in his eyes, the lack of\nwhich paralysed him in body and mind, rendered him pitiable to others,\nloathsome to himself,--so much so, that he once said, \"Where is the\nbeggar who would change places with me, notwithstanding all my fame?\"  Ah!\nGod knows perfectly well how to strike.  He permitted him to retain all\nhis literary fame to the very last--his literary fame for which he cared\nnothing; but what became of the sweetness of life, his fine house, his\ngrand company, and his entertainments?  The grand house ceased to be his;\nhe was only permitted to live in it on sufferance, and whatever grandeur\nit might still retain, it soon became as desolate a looking house as any\nmisanthrope could wish to see--where were the grand entertainments and\nthe grand company? there are no grand entertainments where there is no\nmoney; no lords and ladies where there are no entertainments--and there\nlay the poor lodger in the desolate house, groaning on a bed no longer\nhis, smitten by the hand of God in the part where he was most vulnerable.\nOf what use telling such a man to take comfort, for he had written the\n\"Minstrel\" and \"Rob Roy,\"--telling him to think of his literary fame?\nLiterary fame, indeed! he wanted back his lost gentility:--\n\n   \"Retain my altar,\n   I care nothing for it--but, oh! touch not my _beard_.\"\n\n   PORNY'S _War of the Gods_.\n\nHe dies, his children die too, and then comes the crowning judgment of\nGod on what remains of his race and the house which he had built.  He was\nnot a Papist himself, nor did he wish any one belonging to him to be\nPopish, for he had read enough of the Bible to know that no one can be\nsaved through Popery, yet had he a sneaking affection for it, and would\nat times in an underhand manner, give it a good word both in writing and\ndiscourse, because it was a gaudy kind of worship, and ignorance and\nvassalage prevailed so long as it flourished--but he certainly did not\nwish any of his people to become Papists, nor the house which he had\nbuilt to become a Popish house, though the very name he gave it savoured\nof Popery; but Popery becomes fashionable through his novels and\npoems--the only one that remains of his race, a female grandchild,\nmarries a person who, following the fashion, becomes a Papist, and makes\nher a Papist too.  Money abounds with the husband, who buys the house,\nand then the house becomes the rankest Popish house in Britain.  A\nsuperstitious person might almost imagine that one of the old Scottish\nCovenanters, whilst the grand house was being built from the profits\nresulting from the sale of writings favouring Popery and persecution, and\ncalumniatory of Scotland's saints and martyrs, had risen from the grave,\nand banned Scott, his race, and his house, by reading a certain psalm.\n\nIn saying what he has said about Scott, the author has not been\ninfluenced by any feeling of malice or ill-will, but simply by a regard\nfor truth, and a desire to point out to his countrymen the harm which has\nresulted from the perusal of his works;--he is not one of those who would\ndepreciate the talents of Scott--he admires his talents, both as a prose\nwriter and a poet; as a poet especially he admires him, and believes him\nto have been by far the greatest, with perhaps the exception of\nMickiewicz, who only wrote for unfortunate Poland, that Europe has given\nbirth to during the last hundred years.  As a prose writer he admires\nhim, less, it is true, but his admiration for him in that capacity is\nvery high, and he only laments that he prostituted his talents to the\ncause of the Stuarts and gentility.  What book of fiction of the present\ncentury can you read twice, with the exception of \"Waverley\" and \"Rob\nRoy?\"  There is \"Pelham,\" it is true, which the writer of these lines has\nseen a Jewess reading in the steppe of Debreczin, and which a young\nPrussian Baron, a great traveller, whom he met at Constantinople in '44\ntold him he always carried in his valise.  And, in conclusion, he will\nsay, in order to show the opinion which he entertains of the power of\nScott as a writer, that he did for the sceptre of the wretched Pretender\nwhat all the kings of Europe could not do for his body--placed it on the\nthrone of these realms; and for Popery, what Popes and Cardinals strove\nin vain to do for three centuries--brought back its mummeries and\nnonsense into the temples of the British Isles.\n\nScott during his lifetime had a crowd of imitators, who, whether they\nwrote history so called--poetry so called--or novels--nobody would call a\nbook a novel if he could call it anything else--wrote Charlie o'er the\nwater nonsense; and now that he has been dead nearly a quarter of a\ncentury, there are others daily springing up who are striving to imitate\nScott in his Charlie o'er the water nonsense--for nonsense it is, even\nwhen flowing from his pen.  They, too, must write Jacobite histories,\nJacobite songs, and Jacobite novels, and much the same figure as the\nscoundrel menials in the comedy cut when personating their masters, and\nretailing their masters' conversation, do they cut as Walter Scotts.  In\ntheir histories, they too talk about the Prince and Glenfinnan, and the\npibroch; and in their songs about \"Claverse\" and \"Bonny Dundee.\"  But\nthough they may be Scots, they are not Walter Scotts.  But it is perhaps\nchiefly in the novel that you see the veritable hog in armour; the time\nof the novel is of course the '15 or '45; the hero a Jacobite, and\nconnected with one or other of the enterprises of those periods; and the\nauthor, to show how unprejudiced he is, and what _original_ views he\ntakes of subjects, must needs speak up for Popery, whenever he has\noccasion to mention it; though, with all his originality, when he brings\nhis hero and the vagabonds with which he is concerned before a\nbarricadoed house, belonging to the Whigs, he can make them get into it\nby no other method than that which Scott makes his rioters employ to get\ninto the Tolbooth, _burning down_ the door.\n\nTo express the more than utter foolishness of this latter Charlie o'er\nthe water nonsense, whether in rhyme or prose, there is but one word, and\nthat word a Scotch word.  Scotch, the sorriest of jargons, compared with\nwhich even Roth Welsch is dignified and expressive, has yet one word to\nexpress what would be inexpressible by any word or combination of words\nin any language, or in any other jargon in the world; and very properly;\nfor as the nonsense is properly Scotch, so should the word be Scotch\nwhich expresses it--that word is \"fushionless,\" pronounced\n_fooshionless_; and when the writer has called the nonsense\nfooshionless--and he does call it fooshionless--he has nothing more to\nsay, but leaves the nonsense to its fate.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--On Canting Nonsense.\n\n\nThe writer now wishes to say something on the subject of canting\nnonsense, of which there is a great deal in England.  There are various\ncants in England, amongst which is the religious cant.  He is not going\nto discuss the subject of religious cant: lest, however, he should be\nmisunderstood, he begs leave to repeat that he is a sincere member of the\nChurch of England, in which he believes there is more religion, and\nconsequently less cant, than in any other church in the world; nor is he\ngoing to discuss many other cants; he shall content himself with saying\nsomething about two--the temperance cant and the unmanly cant.  Temperance\ncanters say that \"it is unlawful to drink a glass of ale.\"  Unmanly\ncanters say that \"it is unlawful to use one's fists.\"  The writer begs\nleave to tell both these species of canters that they do not speak words\nof truth.\n\nIt is very lawful to take a cup of ale, or wine, for the purpose of\ncheering or invigorating yourself when you are faint and down-hearted;\nand likewise to give a cup of ale or wine to others when they are in a\nsimilar condition.  The Holy Scripture sayeth nothing to the contrary,\nbut rather encourageth people in so doing by the text, \"Wine maketh glad\nthe heart of man.\"  But it is not lawful to intoxicate yourself with\nfrequent cups of ale or wine, nor to make others intoxicated, nor does\nthe Holy Scripture say it is.  The Holy Scripture no more says that it is\nlawful to intoxicate yourself or others, than it says that it is unlawful\nto take a cup of ale or wine yourself, or to give one to others.  Noah is\nnot commended in the Scripture for making himself drunken on the wine he\nbrewed.  Nor is it said that the Saviour, when he supplied the guests\nwith first-rate wine at the marriage-feast, told them to make themselves\ndrunk upon it.  He is said to have supplied them with first-rate wine,\nbut He doubtless left the quantity which each should drink to each\nparty's reason and discretion.  When you set a good dinner before your\nguests, you do not expect that they should gorge themselves with the\nvictuals you set before them.  Wine may be abused, and so may a leg of\nmutton.\n\nSecond.  It is lawful for any one to use his fists in his own defence, or\nin the defence of others, provided they can't help themselves; but it is\nnot lawful to use them for purposes of tyranny or brutality.  If you are\nattacked by a ruffian, as the elderly individual in Lavengro is in the\ninn-yard, it is quite lawful, if you can, to give him as good a thrashing\nas the elderly individual gave the brutal coachman; and if you see a\nhelpless woman--perhaps your own sister--set upon by a drunken lord, a\ndrunken coachman, or a drunken coalheaver, or a brute of any description,\neither drunk or sober, it is not only lawful but laudable, to give them,\nif you can, a good drubbing; but it is not lawful because you have a\nstrong pair of fists, and know how to use them, to go swaggering through\na fair, jostling against unoffending individuals; should you do so, you\nwould be served quite right if you were to get a drubbing, more\nparticularly if you were served out by some one less strong, but more\nskilful than yourself--even as the coachman was served out by a pupil of\nthe immortal Broughton--sixty years old, it is true, but possessed of\nBroughton's guard and chop.  Moses is not blamed in the Scripture for\ntaking part with the oppressed, and killing an Egyptian persecutor.  We\nare not told how Moses killed the Egyptian; but it is quite as creditable\nto Moses to suppose that he killed the Egyptian by giving him a buffet\nunder the left ear, as by stabbing him with a knife.  It is true that the\nSaviour in the New Testament tells His disciples to turn the left cheek\nto be smitten, after they had received a blow on the right; but He was\nspeaking to people divinely inspired, or whom He intended divinely to\ninspire--people selected by God for a particular purpose.  He likewise\ntells these people to part with various articles of raiment when asked\nfor them, and to go a-travelling without money, and take no thought of\nthe morrow.  Are those exhortations carried out by very good people in\nthe present day?  Do Quakers, when smitten on the right cheek, turn the\nleft to the smiter?  When asked for their coat, do they say, \"Friend,\ntake my shirt also?\"  Has the Dean of Salisbury no purse?  Does the\nArchbishop of Canterbury go to an inn, run up a reckoning, and then say\nto his landlady, \"Mistress, I have no coin?\"  Assuredly the Dean has a\npurse, and a tolerably well-filled one; and, assuredly, the Archbishop,\non departing from an inn, not only settles his reckoning, but leaves\nsomething handsome for the servants, and does not say that he is\nforbidden by the gospel to pay for what he has eaten, or the trouble he\nhas given, as a certain Spanish cavalier said he was forbidden by the\nstatutes of chivalry.  Now, to take the part of yourself, or the part of\nthe oppressed, with your fists, is quite as lawful in the present day as\nit is to refuse your coat and shirt also to any vagabond who may ask for\nthem, and not to refuse to pay for supper, bed, and breakfast, at the\nFeathers, or any other inn, after you have had the benefit of all three.\n\nThe conduct of Lavengro with respect to drink may, upon the whole, serve\nas a model.  He is no drunkard, nor is he fond of intoxicating other\npeople; yet when the horrors are upon him he has no objection to go to a\npublic-house and call for a pint of ale, nor does he shrink from\nrecommending ale to others when they are faint and downcast.  In one\ninstance, it is true, he does what cannot be exactly justified; he\nencourages the Priest in the dingle, in more instances than one, in\ndrinking more hollands and water than is consistent with decorum.  He has\na motive indeed in doing so; a desire to learn from the knave in his cups\nthe plans and hopes of the Propaganda of Rome.  Such conduct, however,\nwas inconsistent with strict fair dealing and openness; and the author\nadvises all those whose consciences never reproach them for a single\nunfair or covert act committed by them, to abuse him heartily for\nadministering hollands and water to the Priest of Rome.  In that instance\nthe hero is certainly wrong; yet in all other cases with regard to drink,\nhe is manifestly right.  To tell people that they are never to drink a\nglass of ale or wine themselves, or to give one to others, is cant; and\nthe writer has no toleration for cant of any description.  Some cants are\nnot dangerous; but the writer believes that a more dangerous cant than\nthe temperance cant, or as it is generally called, teetotalism, is\nscarcely to be found.  The writer is willing to believe that it\noriginated with well meaning, though weak people; but there can be no\ndoubt that it was quickly turned to account by people who were neither\nwell meaning nor weak.  Let the reader note particularly the purpose to\nwhich this cry has been turned in America; the land, indeed, par\nexcellence, of humbug and humbug cries.  It is there continually in the\nmouth of the most violent political party, and is made an instrument of\nalmost unexampled persecution.  The writer would say more on the\ntemperance cant, both in England and America, but want of space prevents\nhim.  There is one point on which he cannot avoid making a few brief\nremarks--that is, the inconsistent conduct of its apostles in general.\nThe teetotal apostle says, it is a dreadful thing to be drunk.  So it is,\nteetotaller; but if so, why do you get drunk?  I get drunk?  Yes, unhappy\nman, why do you get drunk on smoke and passion?  Why are your garments\nimpregnated with the odour of the Indian weed?  Why is there a pipe or a\ncigar always in your mouth?  Why is your language more dreadful than that\nof a Poissarde?  Tobacco-smoke is more deleterious than ale, teetotaller;\nbile more potent than brandy.  You are fond of telling your hearers what\nan awful thing it is to die drunken.  So it is, teetotaller.  Then take\ngood care that you do not die with smoke and passion, drunken, and with\ntemperance language on your lips; that is, abuse and calumny against all\nthose who differ from you.  One word of sense you have been heard to say,\nwhich is, that spirits may be taken as a medicine.  Now you are in a\nfever of passion, teetotaller; so, pray take this tumbler of brandy; take\nit on the homoeopathic principle, that heat is to be expelled by heat.\nYou are in a temperance fury, so swallow the contents of this tumbler,\nand it will, perhaps, cure you.  You look at the glass wistfully--you\noccasionally take a glass medicinally--and it is probable you do.  Take\none now.  Consider what a dreadful thing it would be to die passion\ndrunk; to appear before your Maker with intemperate language on your\nlips.  That's right!  You don't seem to wince at the brandy.  That's\nright!--well done!  All down in two pulls.  Now you look like a\nreasonable being!\n\nIf the conduct of Lavengro with regard to drink is open to little\ncensure, assuredly the use which he makes of his fists is entitled to\nnone at all.  Because he has a pair of tolerably strong fists, and knows\nto a certain extent how to use them, is he a swaggerer or oppressor?  To\nwhat ill account does he turn them?  Who more quiet, gentle, and\ninoffensive than he?  He beats off a ruffian who attacks him in a dingle;\nhas a kind of friendly tuzzle with Mr. Petulengro, and behold the extent\nof his fistic exploits.\n\nAy, but he associates with prize-fighters; and that very fellow,\nPetulengro, is a prize-fighter, and has fought for a stake in a ring.\nWell, and if he had not associated with prize-fighters, how could he have\nused his fists?  Oh, anybody can use his fists in his own defence,\nwithout being taught by prize-fighters.  Can they?  Then why does not the\nItalian, or Spaniard, or Affghan use his fists when insulted or outraged,\ninstead of having recourse to the weapons which he has recourse to?\nNobody can use his fists without being taught the use of them by those\nwho have themselves been taught, no more than any one can \"whiffle\"\nwithout being taught by a master of the art.  Now let any man of the\npresent day try to whiffle.  Would not any one who wished to whiffle have\nto go to a master of the art?  Assuredly! but where would he find one at\nthe present day?  The last of the whifflers hanged himself about a\nfortnight ago on a bell-rope in a church steeple of \"the old town,\" from\npure grief that there was no further demand for the exhibition of his\nart, there being no demand for whiffling since the discontinuation of\nGuildhall banquets.  Whiffling is lost.  The old chap left his sword\nbehind him; let any one take up the old chap's sword and try to whiffle.\nNow much the same hand as he would make who should take up the whiffler's\nsword and try to whiffle, would he who should try to use his fists who\nhad never had the advantage of a master.  Let no one think that men use\ntheir fists naturally in their own disputes--men have naturally recourse\nto any other thing to defend themselves or to offend others; they fly to\nthe stick, to the stone, to the murderous and cowardly knife, or to abuse\nas cowardly as the knife, and occasionally more murderous.  Now which is\nbest when you hate a person, or have a pique against a person, to clench\nyour fist and say \"Come on,\" or to have recourse to the stone, the\nknife,--or murderous calumny?  The use of the fist is almost lost in\nEngland.  Yet are the people better than they were when they knew how to\nuse their fists?  The writer believes not.  A fisty combat is at present\na great rarity, but the use of the knife, the noose, and of poison, to\nsay nothing of calumny, are of more frequent occurrence in England than\nperhaps in any country in Europe.  Is polite taste better than when it\ncould bear the details of a fight?  The writer believes not.  Two men\ncannot meet in a ring to settle a dispute in a manly manner without some\ntrumpery local newspaper letting loose a volley of abuse against \"the\ndisgraceful exhibition,\" in which abuse it is sure to be sanctioned by\nits dainty readers; whereas some murderous horror, the discovery for\nexample of the mangled remains of a woman in some obscure den, is\ngreedily seized hold of by the moral journal, and dressed up for its\nreaders, who luxuriate and gloat upon the ghastly dish.  Now, the writer\nof Lavengro has no sympathy with those who would shrink from striking a\nblow, but would not shrink from the use of poison or calumny; and his\ntaste has little in common with that which cannot tolerate the hardy\ndetails of a prize-fight, but which luxuriates on descriptions of the\nmurder dens of modern England.  But prize-fighters and pugilists are\nblackguards, a reviewer has said; and blackguards they would be provided\nthey employed their skill and their prowess for purposes of brutality and\noppression; but prize-fighters and pugilists are seldom friends to\nbrutality and oppression; and which is the blackguard, the writer would\nask, he who uses his fists to take his own part, or instructs others to\nuse theirs for the same purpose, or the being who from envy and malice,\nor at the bidding of a malicious scoundrel, endeavours by calumny,\nfalsehood, and misrepresentation to impede the efforts of lonely and\nunprotected genius?\n\nOne word more about the race, all but extinct, of the people\nopprobriously called prize-fighters.  Some of them have been as noble,\nkindly men as the world ever produced.  Can the rolls of the English\naristocracy exhibit names belonging to more noble, more heroic men than\nthose who were called respectively Pearce, Cribb, and Spring?  Did ever\none of the English aristocracy contract the seeds of fatal consumption by\nrushing up the stairs of a burning edifice, even to the topmost garret,\nand rescuing a woman from seemingly inevitable destruction?  The writer\nsays no.  A woman was rescued from the top of a burning house; but the\nman who rescued her was no aristocrat; it was Pearce, not Percy, who ran\nup the burning stairs.  Did ever one of those glittering ones save a\nfainting female from the libidinous rage of six ruffians?  The writer\nbelieves not.  A woman was rescued from the libidinous fury of six\nmonsters on --- Down; but the man who rescued her was no aristocrat; it\nwas Pearce not Paulet, who rescued the woman, and thrashed my lord's six\ngamekeepers--Pearce, whose equal never was, and probably never will be,\nfound in sturdy combat.  Are there any of the aristocracy of whom it can\nbe said that they never did a cowardly, cruel, or mean action, and that\nthey invariably took the part of the unfortunate and weak against cruelty\nand oppression?  As much can be said of Cribb, of Spring, and the other;\nbut where is the aristocrat of whom as much can be said?  Wellington?\nWellington indeed! a skilful general, and a good man of valour, it is\ntrue, but with that cant word of \"duty\" continually on his lips, did he\nrescue Ney from his butchers?  Did he lend a helping hand to Warner?\n\nIn conclusion, the writer would advise those of his country-folks who\nread his book to have nothing to do with the two kinds of canting\nnonsense described above, but in their progress through life to enjoy as\nwell as they can, but always with moderation, the good things of this\nworld, to put confidence in God, to be as independent as possible, and to\ntake their own parts.  If they are low-spirited, let them not make\nthemselves foolish by putting on sackcloth, drinking water, or chewing\nashes, but let them take wholesome exercise, and eat the most generous\nfood they can get, taking up and reading occasionally, not the lives of\nIgnatius Loyola and Francis Spira, but something more agreeable; for\nexample, the life and adventures of Mr. Duncan Campbell, the deaf and\ndumb gentleman; the travels of Captain Falconer in America, and the\njournal of John Randall, who went to Virginia and married an Indian wife;\nnot forgetting, amidst their eating and drinking, their walks over\nheaths, and by the sea-side, and their agreeable literature, to be\ncharitable to the poor, to read the Psalms and to go to church twice on a\nSunday.  In their dealings with people, to be courteous to everybody, as\nLavengro was, but always independent like him; and if people meddle with\nthem, to give them as good as they bring, even as he and Isopel Berners\nwere in the habit of doing; and it will be as well for him to observe\nthat he by no means advises women to be too womanly, but bearing the\nconduct of Isopel Berners in mind, to take their own parts, and if\nanybody strikes them, to strike again.\n\nBeating of women by the lords of the creation has become very prevalent\nin England since pugilism has been discountenanced.  Now the writer\nstrongly advises any woman who is struck by a ruffian to strike him\nagain; or if she cannot clench her fists, and he advises all women in\nthese singular times to learn to clench their fists, to go at him with\ntooth and nail, and not to be afraid of the result, for any fellow who is\ndastard enough to strike a woman, would allow himself to be beaten by a\nwoman, were she to make at him in self-defence, even if, instead of\npossessing the stately height and athletic proportions of the aforesaid\nIsopel, she were as diminutive in stature, and had a hand as delicate,\nand foot as small, as a certain royal lady, who was some time ago\nassaulted by a fellow upwards of six feet high, whom the writer has no\ndoubt she could have beaten had she thought proper to go at him.  Such is\nthe deliberate advice of the author to his countrymen and women--advice\nin which he believes there is nothing unscriptural or repugnant to common\nsense.\n\nThe writer is perfectly well aware that, by the plain language which he\nhas used in speaking of the various kinds of nonsense prevalent in\nEngland, he shall make himself a multitude of enemies; but he is not\ngoing to conceal the truth or to tamper with nonsense, from the fear of\nprovoking hostility.  He has a duty to perform and he will perform it\nresolutely; he is the person who carried the Bible to Spain; and as\nresolutely as he spoke in Spain against the superstitions of Spain, will\nhe speak in England against the nonsense of his own native land.  He is\nnot one of those who, before they sit down to write a book, say to\nthemselves, what cry shall we take up? what principles shall we advocate?\nwhat principles shall we abuse? before we put pen to paper we must find\nout what cry is the loudest, what principle has the most advocates,\notherwise, after having written our book, we may find ourselves on the\nweaker side.\n\nA sailor of the \"Bounty,\" waked from his sleep by the noise of the\nmutiny, lay still in his hammock for some time, quite undecided whether\nto take part with the captain or to join the mutineers.  \"I must mind\nwhat I do,\" said he to himself, \"lest, in the end, I find myself on the\nweaker side;\" finally, on hearing that the mutineers were successful, he\nwent on deck, and seeing Bligh pinioned to the mast, he put his fist to\nhis nose, and otherwise insulted him.  Now, there are many writers of the\npresent day whose conduct is very similar to that of the sailor.  They\nlie listening in their corners till they have ascertained which principle\nhas most advocates; then, presently, they make their appearance on the\ndeck of the world with their book; if truth has been victorious, then has\ntruth the hurrah! but if truth is pinioned against the mast, then is\ntheir fist thrust against the nose of truth, and their gibe and their\ninsult spirted in her face.  The strongest party had the sailor, and the\nstrongest party has almost invariably the writer of the present day.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--Pseudo-Critics.\n\n\nA certain set of individuals calling themselves critics have attacked\nLavengro with much virulence and malice.  If what they call criticism had\nbeen founded on truth, the author would have had nothing to say.  The\nbook contains plenty of blemishes, some of them, by the bye, wilful ones,\nas the writer will presently show; not one of these, however, has been\ndetected and pointed out; but the best passages in the book, indeed\nwhatever was calculated to make the book valuable, have been assailed\nwith abuse and misrepresentation.  The duty of the true critic is to play\nthe part of a leech, and not of a viper.  Upon true and upon malignant\ncriticism there is an excellent fable by the Spaniard Iriarte.  The viper\nsays to the leech, \"Why do people invite your bite, and flee from mine?\"\n\"Because,\" says the leech, \"people receive health from my bite, and\npoison from yours.\"  \"There is as much difference,\" says the clever\nSpaniard, \"between true and malignant criticism, as between poison and\nmedicine.\"  Certainly a great many meritorious writers have allowed\nthemselves to be poisoned by malignant criticism; the writer, however, is\nnot one of those who allow themselves to be poisoned by pseudo-critics;\nno! no! he will rather hold them up by their tails, and show the\ncreatures wriggling, blood and foam streaming from their broken jaws.\nFirst of all, however, he will notice one of their objections.  \"The book\nisn't true,\" say they.  Now one of the principal reasons with those that\nhave attacked Lavengro for their abuse of it is, that it is particularly\ntrue in one instance, namely, that it exposes their own nonsense, their\nlove of humbug, their slavishness, their dressings, their goings out,\ntheir scraping and bowing to great people; it is the showing up of\n\"gentility-nonsense\" in Lavengro that has been one principal reason for\nraising the above cry; for in Lavengro is denounced the besetting folly\nof the English people, a folly which those who call themselves guardians\nof the public taste are far from being above.  \"We can't abide anything\nthat isn't true!\" they exclaim.  Can't they?  Then why are they so\nenraptured with any fiction that is adapted to purposes of humbug, which\ntends to make them satisfied with their own proceedings, with their own\nnonsense, which does not tell them to reform, to become more alive to\ntheir own failings, and less sensitive about the tyrannical goings on of\nthe masters, and the degraded condition, the sufferings, and the trials\nof the serfs in the star Jupiter?  Had Lavengro, instead of being the\nwork of an independent mind, been written in order to further any of the\nthousand and one cants, and species of nonsense prevalent in England, the\nauthor would have heard much less about its not being true, both from\npublic detractors and private censurers.\n\n\"But Lavengro pretends to be an autobiography,\" say the critics; and here\nthe writer begs leave to observe, that it would be well for people who\nprofess to have a regard for truth, not to exhibit in every assertion\nwhich they make a most profligate disregard of it; this assertion of\ntheirs is a falsehood, and they know it to be a falsehood.  In the\npreface Lavengro is stated to be a dream; and the writer takes this\nopportunity of stating that he never said it was an autobiography; never\nauthorized any person to say that it was one; and that he has in\ninnumerable instances declared in public and private, both before and\nafter the work was published, that it was not what is generally termed an\nautobiography: but a set of people who pretend to write criticisms on\nbooks, hating the author for various reasons,--amongst others, because,\nhaving the proper pride of a gentleman and a scholar, he did not, in the\nyear '43, choose to permit himself to be exhibited and made a zany of in\nLondon, and especially because he will neither associate with, nor curry\nfavour with, them who are neither gentlemen nor scholars,--attack his\nbook with abuse and calumny.  He is, perhaps, condescending too much when\nhe takes any notice of such people; as, however, the English public is\nwonderfully led by cries and shouts, and generally ready to take part\nagainst any person who is either unwilling or unable to defend himself,\nhe deems it advisable not to be altogether quiet with those who assail\nhim.  The best way to deal with vipers is to tear out their teeth; and\nthe best way to deal with pseudo-critics is to deprive them of their\npoison-bag, which is easily done by exposing their ignorance.  The writer\nknew perfectly well the description of people with whom he would have to\ndo, he therefore very quietly prepared a stratagem, by means of which he\ncould at any time exhibit them, powerless and helpless, in his hand.\nCritics, when they review books, ought to have a competent knowledge of\nthe subjects which those books discuss.\n\nLavengro is a philological book, a poem if you choose to call it so.  Now,\nwhat a fine triumph it would have been for those who wished to vilify the\nbook and its author, provided they could have detected the latter\ntripping in his philology--they might have instantly said that he was an\nignorant pretender to philology--they laughed at the idea of his taking\nup a viper by its tail, a trick which hundreds of country urchins do\nevery September, but they were silent about the really wonderful part of\nthe book, the philological matter--they thought philology was his\nstronghold, and that it would be useless to attack him there; they of\ncourse would give him no credit as a philologist, for anything like fair\ntreatment towards him was not to be expected at their hands, but they\nwere afraid to attack his philology--yet that was the point, and the only\npoint in which they might have attacked him successfully; he was\nvulnerable there.  How was this?  Why, in order to have an opportunity of\nholding up pseudo-critics by the tails, he wilfully spelt various foreign\nwords wrong--Welsh words, and even Italian words--did they detect these\nmisspellings? not one of them, even as he knew they would not, and he now\ntaunts them with ignorance; and the power of taunting them with ignorance\nis the punishment which he designed for them--a power which they might\nbut for their ignorance have used against him.  The writer besides\nknowing something of Italian and Welsh, knows a little of Armenian\nlanguage and literature; but who knowing anything of the Armenian\nlanguage, unless he had an end in view, would say, that the word sea in\nArmenian is anything like the word tide in English?  The word for sea in\nArmenian is dzow, a word connected with the Tebetian word for water, and\nthe Chinese shuy, and the Turkish su, signifying the same thing; but\nwhere is the resemblance between dzow and tide?  Again, the word for\nbread in ancient Armenian is hats; yet the Armenian on London Bridge is\nmade to say zhats, which is not the nominative of the Armenian noun for\nbread, but the accusative: now, critics, ravening against a man because\nhe is a gentleman and a scholar, and has not only the power but also the\ncourage to write original works, why did you not discover that weak\npoint?  Why, because you were ignorant, so here ye are held up!  Moreover,\nwho with a name commencing with Z, ever wrote fables in Armenian?  There\nare two writers of fables in Armenian--Varthan and Koscht, and\nillustrious writers they are, one in the simple, and the other in the\nornate style of Armenian composition, but neither of their names begins\nwith a Z.  Oh, what a precious opportunity ye lost, ye ravening crew, of\nconvicting the poor, half-starved, friendless boy of the book, of\nignorance or misrepresentation, by asking who with a name beginning with\nZ ever wrote fables in Armenian; but ye couldn't help yourselves, ye are\nduncie.  We duncie!  Ay, duncie.  So here ye are held up by the tails,\nblood and foam streaming from your jaws.\n\nThe writer wishes to ask here, what do you think of all this, Messieurs\nles Critiques?  Were ye ever served so before?  But don't you richly\ndeserve it?  Haven't you been for years past bullying and insulting\neverybody whom you deemed weak, and currying favour with everybody whom\nyou thought strong?  \"We approve of this.  We disapprove of that.  Oh,\nthis will never do.  These are fine lines!\"  The lines perhaps some\nhorrid sycophantic rubbish addressed to Wellington, or Lord So-and-so.  To\nhave your ignorance thus exposed, to be shown up in this manner, and by\nwhom?  A gypsy!  Ay, a gypsy was the very right person to do it.  But is\nit not galling, after all?\n\n\"Ah, but _we_ don't understand Armenian, it cannot be expected that _we_\nshould understand Armenian, or Welsh, or--Hey, what's this?  The mighty\n_we_ not understand Armenian or Welsh, or--Then why does the mighty _we_\npretend to review a book like Lavengro?  From the arrogance with which it\ncontinually delivers itself, one would think that the mighty _we_ is\nomniscient; that it understands every language; is versed in every\nliterature; yet the mighty _we_ does not even know the word for bread in\nArmenian.  It knows bread well enough by name in England, and frequently\nbread in England only by its name, but the truth is, that the mighty\n_we_, with all its pretension, is in general a very sorry creature, who,\ninstead of saying nous disons, should rather say nous dis: Porny in his\n\"Guerre des Dieux,\" very profanely makes the three in one say, Je\nfaisons; now, Lavengro, who is anything but profane, would suggest that\ncritics, especially magazine and Sunday newspaper critics, should\ncommence with nous dis, as the first word would be significant of the\nconceit and assumption of the critic, and the second of the extent of the\ncritic's information.  The _we_ says its say, but when fawning sycophancy\nor vulgar abuse are taken from that say, what remains?  Why a blank, a\nvoid like Ginnungagap.\n\nAs the writer, of his own accord, has exposed some of the blemishes of\nhis book--a task, which a competent critic ought to have done--he will\nnow point out two or three of its merits, which any critic, not\naltogether blinded with ignorance might have done, or not replete with\ngall and envy would have been glad to do.  The book has the merit of\ncommunicating a fact connected with physiology, which in all the pages of\nthe multitude of books was never previously mentioned--the mysterious\npractice of touching objects to baffle the evil chance.  The miserable\ndetractor will, of course, instantly begin to rave about such a habit\nbeing common: well and good; but was it ever before described in print,\nor all connected with it dissected?  He may then vociferate something\nabout Johnson having touched:--the writer cares not whether Johnson, who,\nby the bye, during the last twenty or thirty years, owing to people\nhaving become ultra Tory mad from reading Scott's novels and the\n\"Quarterly Review,\" has been a mighty favourite, especially with some who\nwere in the habit of calling him a half crazy old fool--touched, or\nwhether he did or not; but he asks where did Johnson ever describe the\nfeelings which induced him to perform the magic touch, even supposing\nthat he did perform it?  Again, the history gives an account of a certain\nbook called the \"Sleeping Bard,\" the most remarkable prose work of the\nmost difficult language but one, of modern Europe,--a book, for a notice\nof which, he believes, one might turn over in vain the pages of any\nreview printed in England, or, indeed, elsewhere.--So here are two facts,\none literary and the other physiological, for which any candid critic was\nbound to thank the author, even as in Romany Rye there is a fact\nconnected with Iro Norman Myth, for the disclosing of which, any person\nwho pretends to have a regard for literature is bound to thank him,\nnamely, that the mysterious Finn or Fingal of \"Ossian's Poems\" is one and\nthe same person as the Sigurd Fofnisbane of the Edda and the Wilkina, and\nthe Siegfried Horn of the Lay of the Niebelungs.\n\nThe writer might here conclude, and, he believes, most triumphantly; as,\nhowever, he is in the cue for writing, which he seldom is, he will for\nhis own gratification, and for the sake of others, dropping metaphors\nabout vipers and serpents, show up in particular two or three sets or\ncliques of people, who, he is happy to say, have been particularly\nvirulent against him and his work, for nothing indeed could have given\nhim greater mortification than their praise.\n\nIn the first place, he wishes to dispose of certain individuals who call\nthemselves men of wit and fashion--about town--who he is told have abused\nhis book \"vaustly\"--their own word.  These people paint their cheeks,\nwear white kid gloves, and dabble in literature, or what they conceive to\nbe literature.  For abuse from such people, the writer was prepared.  Does\nany one imagine that the writer was not well aware, before he published\nhis book, that, whenever he gave it to the world, he should be attacked\nby every literary coxcomb in England who had influence enough to procure\nthe insertion of a scurrilous article in a magazine or newspaper!  He has\nbeen in Spain, and has seen how invariably the mule attacks the horse;\nnow why does the mule attack the horse?  Why, because the latter carries\nabout with him that which the envious hermaphrodite does not possess.\n\nThey consider, forsooth, that his book is low--but he is not going to\nwaste words about them--one or two of whom, he is told, have written very\nduncie books about Spain, and are highly enraged with him, because\ncertain books which he wrote about Spain were not considered duncie.  No,\nhe is not going to waste words upon them, for verily he dislikes their\ncompany, and so he'll pass them by, and proceed to others.\n\nThe Scotch Charlie o'er the water people have been very loud in the abuse\nof Lavengro--this again might be expected; the sarcasms of the Priest\nabout the Charlie o'er the water nonsense of course stung them.  Oh! it\nis one of the claims which Lavengro has to respect, that it is the first,\nif not the only work, in which that nonsense is, to a certain extent,\nexposed.  Two or three of their remarks on passages of Lavengro, he will\nreproduce and laugh at.  Of course your Charlie o'er the water people are\ngenteel exceedingly, and cannot abide anything low.  Gypsyism they think\nis particularly low, and the use of gypsy words in literature beneath its\ngentility; so they object to gypsy words being used in Lavengro where\ngypsies are introduced speaking--\"What is Romany forsooth?\" say they.\nVery good!  And what is Scotch? has not the public been nauseated with\nScotch for the last thirty years?  \"Ay, but Scotch is not\"--the writer\nbelieves he knows much better than the Scotch what Scotch is and what it\nis not; he has told them before what it is, a very sorry jargon.  He will\nnow tell them what it is not--a sister or an immediate daughter of the\nSanscrit, which Romany is.  \"Ay, but the Scotch are\"--foxes, foxes,\nnothing else than foxes, even like the gypsies--the difference between\nthe gypsy and Scotch fox being that the first is wild, with a mighty\nbrush, the other a sneak with a gilt collar and without a tail.\n\nA Charlie o'er the water person attempts to be witty, because the writer\nhas said that perhaps a certain old Edinburgh High-School porter, of the\nname of Boee, was perhaps of the same blood as a certain Bui, a Northern\nKemp who distinguished himself at the battle of Horinger Bay.  A pretty\nmatter, forsooth, to excite the ridicule of a Scotchman!  Why, is there a\nbeggar or trumpery fellow in Scotland, who does not pretend to be\nsomebody, or related to somebody?  Is not every Scotchman descended from\nsome king, kemp, or cow-stealer of old, by his own account at least?  Why,\nthe writer would even go so far as to bet a trifle that the poor\ncreature, who ridicules Boee's supposed ancestry, has one of his own, at\nleast as grand and as apocryphal as old Boee's of the High School.\n\nThe same Charlie o'er the water person is mightily indignant that\nLavengro should have spoken disrespectfully of William Wallace; Lavengro,\nwhen he speaks of that personage, being a child of about ten years old,\nand repeating merely what he had heard.  All the Scotch, by the bye, for\na great many years past, have been great admirers of William Wallace,\nparticularly the Charlie o'er the water people, who in their nonsense-\nverses about Charlie generally contrive to bring in the name of William,\nWillie, or Wullie Wallace.  The writer begs leave to say that he by no\nmeans wishes to bear hard against William Wallace, but he cannot help\nasking why, if William, Willie, or Wullie Wallace was such a particularly\nnice person, did his brother Scots betray him to a certain renowned\nsouthern warrior, called Edward Longshanks, who caused him to be hanged\nand cut into four in London, and his quarters to be placed over the gates\nof certain towns?  They got gold, it is true, and titles, very nice\nthings, no doubt; but, surely, the life of a patriot is better than all\nthe gold and titles in the world--at least Lavengro thinks so--but\nLavengro has lived more with gypsies than Scotchmen, and gypsies do not\nbetray their brothers.  It would be some time before a gypsy would hand\nover his brother to the harum-beck, even supposing you would not only\nmake him a king, but a justice of the peace, and not only give him the\nworld, but the best farm on the Holkham estate; but gypsies are wild\nfoxes, and there is certainly a wonderful difference between the way of\nthinking of the wild fox who retains his brush, and that of the scurvy\nkennel creature who has lost his tail.\n\nAh! but thousands of Scotch, and particularly the Charlie o'er the water\npeople, will say, \"We didn't sell Willie Wallace, it was our forbears who\nsold Willie Wallace--If Edward Longshanks had asked us to sell Wullie\nWallace, we would soon have shown him that--\"  Lord better ye, ye poor\ntrumpery set of creatures, ye would not have acted a bit better than your\nforefathers; remember how ye have ever treated the few amongst ye who,\nthough born in the kennel, have shown something of the spirit of the\nwood.  Many of ye are still alive who delivered over men, quite as honest\nand patriotic as William Wallace, into the hands of an English minister,\nto be chained and transported for merely venturing to speak and write in\nthe cause of humanity, at the time when Europe was beginning to fling off\nthe chains imposed by kings and priests.  And it is not so very long\nsince Burns, to whom ye are now building up obelisks rather higher than\nhe deserves, was permitted by his countrymen to die in poverty and\nmisery, because he would not join with them in songs of adulation to\nkings and the trumpery great.  So say not that ye would have acted with\nrespect to William Wallace one whit better than your fathers--and you in\nparticular, ye children of Charlie, whom do ye write nonsense-verses\nabout?  A family of dastard despots, who did their best, during a century\nand more, to tread out the few sparks of independent feeling still\nglowing in Scotland--but enough has been said about ye.\n\nAmongst those who have been prodigal in abuse and defamation of Lavengro,\nhave been your modern Radicals, and particularly a set of people who\nfilled the country with noise against the King and Queen, Wellington, and\nthe Tories, in '32.  About these people the writer will presently have\noccasion to say a good deal, and also of real Radicals.  As, however, it\nmay be supposed that he is one of those who delight to play the sycophant\nto kings and queens, to curry favour with Tories, and to bepraise\nWellington, he begs leave to state that such is not the case.\n\nAbout kings and queens he has nothing to say; about Tories, simply that\nhe believes them to be a bad set; about Wellington, however, it will be\nnecessary for him to say a good deal, of mixed import, as he will\nsubsequently frequently have occasion to mention him in connection with\nwhat he has to say about pseudo-Radicals.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X--Pseudo-Radicals.\n\n\nAbout Wellington, then, he says, that he believes him at the present day\nto be infinitely overrated.  But there certainly was a time when he was\nshamefully underrated.  Now what time was that?  Why the time of pseudo-\nRadicalism, par excellence, from '20 to '32.  Oh, the abuse that was\nheaped on Wellington by those who traded in Radical cant--your newspaper\neditors and review writers! and how he was sneered at then by your Whigs,\nand how faintly supported he was by your Tories, who were half ashamed of\nhim; for your Tories, though capital fellows as followers, when you want\nnobody to back you, are the faintest creatures in the world when you cry\nin your agony, \"Come and help me!\"  Oh, assuredly Wellington was\ninfamously used at that time, especially by your traders in Radicalism,\nwho howled at and hooted him; said he had every vice--was no general--was\nbeaten at Waterloo--was a poltroon--moreover a poor illiterate creature,\nwho could scarcely read or write; nay, a principal Radical paper said\nboldly he could not read, and devised an ingenious plan for teaching\nWellington how to read.  Now this was too bad; and the writer, being a\nlover of justice, frequently spoke up for Wellington, saying, that as for\nvice, he was not worse than his neighbours; that he was brave; that he\nwon the fight at Waterloo, from a half-dead man, it is true, but that he\ndid win it.  Also, that he believed he had read \"Rules for the Manual and\nPlatoon Exercises\" to some purpose; moreover, that he was sure he could\nwrite, for that he the writer had once written to Wellington, and had\nreceived an answer from him; nay, the writer once went so far as to\nstrike a blow for Wellington; for the last time he used his fists was\nupon a Radical sub-editor, who was mobbing Wellington in the street, from\nbehind a rank of grimy fellows; but though the writer spoke up for\nWellington to a certain extent, when he was shamefully underrated, and\nonce struck a blow for him when he was about being hustled, he is not\ngoing to join in the loathsome sycophantic nonsense which it has been the\nfashion to use with respect to Wellington these last twenty years.  Now\nwhat have those years been to England!  Why the years of ultra-gentility,\neverybody in England having gone gentility mad during the last twenty\nyears, and no people more so than your pseudo-Radicals.  Wellington was\nturned out, and your Whigs and Radicals got in, and then commenced the\nperiod of ultra-gentility in England.  The Whigs and Radicals only hated\nWellington as long as the patronage of the country was in his hands, none\nof which they were tolerably sure he would bestow on them; but no sooner\ndid they get it into their own, than they forthwith became admirers of\nWellington.  And why?  Because he was a duke, petted at Windsor and by\nforeign princes, and a very genteel personage.  Formerly many of your\nWhigs and Radicals had scarcely a decent coat on their backs; but now the\nplunder of the country was at their disposal, and they had as good a\nchance of being genteel as any people.  So they were willing to worship\nWellington because he was very genteel, and could not keep the plunder of\nthe country out of their hands.  And Wellington has been worshipped, and\nprettily so, during the last fifteen or twenty years.  He is now a noble\nfine-hearted creature; the greatest general the world ever produced; the\nbravest of men; and--and--mercy upon us! the greatest of military\nwriters!  Now the present writer will not join in such sycophancy.  As he\nwas not afraid to take the part of Wellington when he was scurvily used\nby all parties, and when it was dangerous to take his part, so he is not\nafraid to speak the naked truth about Wellington in these days, when it\nis dangerous to say anything about him but what is sycophantically\nlaudatory.  He said in '32, that as to vice, Wellington was not worse\nthan his neighbours; but he is not going to say, in '54, that Wellington\nwas a noble-hearted fellow; for he believes that a more cold-hearted\nindividual never existed.  His conduct to Warner, the poor Vaudois, and\nMarshal Ney, showed that.  He said, in '32, that he was a good general\nand a brave man; but he is not going, in '54, to say that he was the best\ngeneral, or the bravest man the world ever saw.  England has produced a\nbetter general--France two or three--both countries many braver men.  The\nson of the Norfolk clergyman was a brave man; Marshal Ney was a braver\nman.  Oh, that battle of Copenhagen!  Oh, that covering the retreat of\nthe Grand Army!  And though he said in '32 that he could write, he is not\ngoing to say in '54 that he is the best of all military writers.  On the\ncontrary, he does not hesitate to say that any Commentary of Julius\nCaesar, or any chapter in Justinus, more especially the one about the\nParthians, is worth the ten volumes of Wellington's Despatches; though he\nhas no doubt that, by saying so, he shall especially rouse the\nindignation of a certain newspaper, at present one of the most genteel\njournals imaginable--with a slight tendency to Liberalism, it is true,\nbut perfectly genteel--which is nevertheless the very one which, in '32,\nswore bodily that Wellington could neither read nor write, and devised an\ningenious plan for teaching him how to read.\n\nNow, after the above statement, no one will venture to say, if the writer\nshould be disposed to bear hard upon Radicals, that he would be\ninfluenced by a desire to pay court to princes, or to curry favour with\nTories, or from being a blind admirer of the Duke of Wellington; but the\nwriter is not going to declaim against Radicals, that is, real\nRepublicans, or their principles; upon the whole, he is something of an\nadmirer of both.  The writer has always had as much admiration for\neverything that is real and honest as he has had contempt for the\nopposite.  Now real Republicanism is certainly a very fine thing, a much\nfiner thing than Toryism, a system of common robbery, which is\nnevertheless far better than Whiggism {7}--a compound of petty larceny,\npopular instruction, and receiving of stolen goods.  Yes, real\nRepublicanism is certainly a very fine thing, and your real Radicals and\nRepublicans are certainly very fine fellows, or rather were fine fellows,\nfor the Lord only knows where to find them at the present day--the writer\ndoes not.  If he did, he would at any time go five miles to invite one of\nthem to dinner, even supposing that he had to go to a workhouse in order\nto find the person he wished to invite.  Amongst the real Radicals of\nEngland, those who flourished from the year '16 to '20, there were\ncertainly extraordinary characters, men partially insane, perhaps, but\nhonest and brave--they did not make a market of the principles which they\nprofessed, and never intended to do so; they believed in them, and were\nwilling to risk their lives in endeavouring to carry them out.  The\nwriter wishes to speak in particular of two of these men, both of whom\nperished on the scaffold--their names were Thistlewood and Ings.\nThistlewood, the best known of them, was a brave soldier, and had served\nwith distinction as an officer in the French service; he was one of the\nexcellent swordsmen of Europe; had fought several duels in France, where\nit is no child's play to fight a duel; but had never unsheathed his sword\nfor single combat, but in defence of the feeble and insulted--he was kind\nand open-hearted, but of too great simplicity; he had once ten thousand\npounds left him, all of which he lent to a friend, who disappeared and\nnever returned a penny.  Ings was an uneducated man, of very low stature,\nbut amazing strength and resolution; he was a kind husband and father,\nand though a humble butcher, the name he bore was one of the royal names\nof the heathen Anglo-Saxons.  These two men, along with five others, were\nexecuted, and their heads hacked off, for levying war against George the\nFourth; the whole seven dying in a manner which extorted cheers from the\npopulace; the most of then uttering philosophical or patriotic sayings.\nThistlewood, who was, perhaps, the most calm and collected of all, just\nbefore he was turned off, said, \"We are now going to discover the great\nsecret.\"  Ings, the moment before he was choked, was singing \"Scots wha\nha' wi' Wallace bled.\"  Now there was no humbug about those men, nor\nabout many more of the same time and of the same principles.  They might\nbe deluded about Republicanism, as Algernon Sidney was, and as Brutus\nwas, but they were as honest and brave as either Brutus or Sidney; and as\nwilling to die for their principles.  But the Radicals who succeeded them\nwere beings of a very different description; they jobbed and traded in\nRepublicanism, and either parted with it, or at the present day are eager\nto part with it for a consideration.  In order to get the Whigs into\npower, and themselves places, they brought the country by their\ninflammatory language to the verge of a revolution, and were the cause\nthat many perished on the scaffold; by their incendiary harangues and\nnewspaper articles they caused the Bristol conflagration, for which six\npoor creatures were executed; they encouraged the mob to pillage, pull\ndown and burn, and then rushing into garrets looked on.  Thistlewood\ntells the mob the Tower is a second Bastile; let it be pulled down.  A\nmob tries to pull down the Tower; but Thistlewood is at the head of that\nmob; he is not peeping from a garret on Tower Hill like Gulliver at\nLisbon.  Thistlewood and Ings say to twenty ragged individuals, Liverpool\nand Castlereagh are two satellites of despotism; it would be highly\ndesirable to put them out of the way.  And a certain number of ragged\nindividuals are surprised in a stable in Cato Street, making preparations\nto put Castlereagh and Liverpool out of the way, and are fired upon with\nmuskets by Grenadiers, and are hacked at with cutlasses by Bow Street\nrunners; but the twain who encouraged those ragged individuals to meet in\nCato Street are not far off, they are not on the other side of the river,\nin the Borough, for example, in some garret or obscure cellar.  The very\nfirst to confront the Guards and runners are Thistlewood and Ings;\nThistlewood whips his long thin rapier through Smithers' lungs, and Ings\nmakes a dash at Fitzclarence with his butcher's knife.  Oh, there was\nsomething in those fellows! honesty and courage--but can as much be said\nfor the inciters of the troubles of '32?  No; they egged on poor ignorant\nmechanics and rustics, and got them hanged for pulling down and burning,\nwhilst the highest pitch to which their own daring ever mounted was to\nmob Wellington as he passed in the streets.\n\nNow, these people were humbugs, which Thistlewood and Ings were not.  They\nraved and foamed against kings, queens, Wellington, the aristocracy, and\nwhat not, till they had got the Whigs into power, with whom they were in\nsecret alliance, and with whom they afterwards openly joined in a system\nof robbery and corruption, more flagitious than the old Tory one, because\nthere was more cant about it; for themselves they got consulships,\ncommissionerships, and in some instances governments; for their sons\nclerkships in public offices; and there you may see those sons with the\nnever-failing badge of the low scoundrel-puppy, the gilt chain at the\nwaistcoat pocket; and there you may hear and see them using the\nlanguishing tones, and employing the airs and graces which wenches use\nand employ, who, without being in the family way, wish to make their\nkeepers believe that they are in the family way.  Assuredly great is the\ncleverness of your Radicals of '32, in providing for themselves and their\nfamilies.  Yet, clever as they are, there is one thing they cannot\ndo--they get governments for themselves, commissionerships for their\nbrothers, clerkships for their sons, but there is one thing beyond their\ncraft--they cannot get husbands for their daughters, who, too ugly for\nmarriage, and with their heads filled with the nonsense they have imbibed\nfrom gentility-novels, go over from Socinus to the Pope, becoming sisters\nin fusty convents, or having heard a few sermons in Mr. Platitude's\n\"chapelle,\" seek for admission at the establishment of mother S---, who,\nafter employing them for a time in various menial offices, and making\nthem pluck off their eyebrows hair by hair, generally dismisses them on\nthe plea of sluttishness; whereupon they return to their papas to eat the\nbread of the country, with the comfortable prospect of eating it still in\nthe shape of a pension after their sires are dead.  Papa (ex uno disce\nomnes) living as quietly as he can; not exactly enviably, it is true,\nbeing now and then seen to cast an uneasy and furtive glance behind, even\nas an animal is wont, who has lost by some mischance a very slight\nappendage; as quietly however as he can, and as dignifiedly, a great\nadmirer of every genteel thing and genteel personage, the Duke in\nparticular, whose \"Despatches,\" bound in red morocco, you will find on\nhis table.  A disliker of coarse expressions, and extremes of every kind,\nwith a perfect horror for revolutions and attempts to revolutionize,\nexclaiming now and then, as a shriek escapes from whipped and bleeding\nHungary, a groan from gasping Poland, and a half-stifled curse from down-\ntrodden but scowling Italy, \"Confound the revolutionary canaille, why\ncan't it be quiet!\" in a word, putting one in mind of the parvenu in the\n\"Walpurgis Nacht.\"  The writer is no admirer of Gothe, but the idea of\nthat parvenu was certainly a good one.  Yes, putting one in mind of the\nindividual who says--\n\n   \"Wir waren wahrlich auch nicht dumm,\n      Und thaten oft was wir nicht sollten;\n   Doch jetzo kehrt sich alles um und um,\n      Und eben da wir's fest erhalten wollten.\"\n\n   We were no fools, as every one discern'd,\n      And stopp'd at nought our projects in fulfilling;\n   But now the world seems topsy-turvy turn'd,\n      To keep it quiet just when we were willing.\n\nNow, this class of individuals entertain a mortal hatred for Lavengro and\nits writer, and never lose an opportunity of vituperating both.  It is\ntrue that such hatred is by no means surprising.  There is certainly a\ngreat deal of difference between Lavengro and their own sons; the one\nthinking of independence and philology, whilst he is clinking away at\nkettles, and hammering horse-shoes in dingles; the others stuck up at\npublic offices with gilt chains at their waistcoat-pockets, and giving\nthemselves the airs and graces of females of a certain description.  And\nthere certainly is a great deal of difference between the author of\nLavengro and themselves--he retaining his principles and his brush; they\nwith scarlet breeches on, it is true, but without their Republicanism,\nand their tails.  Oh, the writer can well afford to be vituperated by\nyour pseudo-Radicals of '32!\n\nSome time ago the writer was set upon by an old Radical and his wife; but\nthe matter is too rich not to require a chapter to itself.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI--The Old Radical.\n\n\n   \"This very dirty man, with his very dirty face,\n   Would do any dirty act, which would get him a place.\"\n\nSome time ago the writer was set upon by an old Radical and his wife; but\nbefore he relates the manner in which they set upon him, it will be as\nwell to enter upon a few particulars tending to elucidate their reasons\nfor so doing.\n\nThe writer had just entered into his eighteenth year, when he met at the\ntable of a certain Anglo-Germanist an individual, apparently somewhat\nunder thirty, of middle stature, a thin and weaselly figure, a sallow\ncomplexion, a certain obliquity of vision, and a large pair of\nspectacles.  This person, who had lately come from abroad, and had\npublished a volume of translations, had attracted some slight notice in\nthe literary world, and was looked upon as a kind of lion in a small\nprovincial capital.  After dinner he argued a great deal, spoke\nvehemently against the church, and uttered the most desperate Radicalism\nthat was perhaps ever heard, saying, he hoped that in a short time there\nwould not be a king or queen in Europe, and inveighing bitterly against\nthe English aristocracy, and against the Duke of Wellington in\nparticular, whom he said, if he himself was ever president of an English\nrepublic--an event which he seemed to think by no means improbable--he\nwould hang for certain infamous acts of profligacy and bloodshed which he\nhad perpetrated in Spain.  Being informed that the writer was something\nof a philologist, to which character the individual in question laid\ngreat pretensions, he came and sat down by him, and talked about\nlanguages and literature.  The writer, who was only a boy, was a little\nfrightened at first, but, not wishing to appear a child of absolute\nignorance, he summoned what little learning he had, and began to blunder\nout something about the Celtic languages and literature, and asked the\nLion who he conceived Finn-Ma-Coul to be? and whether he did not consider\nthe \"Ode to the Fox,\" by Red Rhys of Eryry, to be a masterpiece of\npleasantry?  Receiving no answer to these questions from the Lion, who,\nsingular enough, would frequently, when the writer put a question to him,\nlook across the table, and flatly contradict some one who was talking to\nsome other person, the writer dropped the Celtic languages and\nliterature, and asked him whether he did not think it a funny thing that\nTemugin, generally called Genghis Khan, should have married the daughter\nof Prester John?  {8} The Lion, after giving a side-glance at the writer\nthrough his left spectacle glass, seemed about to reply, but was\nunfortunately prevented, being seized with an irresistible impulse to\ncontradict a respectable doctor of medicine, who was engaged in\nconversation with the master of the house at the upper and farther end of\nthe table, the writer being a poor ignorant lad, sitting of course at the\nbottom.  The doctor, who had served in the Peninsula, having observed\nthat Ferdinand the Seventh was not quite so bad as had been represented,\nthe Lion vociferated that he was ten times worse, and that he hoped to\nsee him and the Duke of Wellington hanged together.  The doctor, who,\nbeing a Welshman, was somewhat of a warm temper, growing rather red, said\nthat at any rate he had been informed that Ferdinand the Seventh knew\nsometimes how to behave himself like a gentleman--this brought on a long\ndispute, which terminated rather abruptly.  The Lion having observed that\nthe doctor must not talk about Spanish matters with one who had visited\nevery part of Spain, the doctor bowed, and said he was right, for that he\nbelieved no people in general possessed such accurate information about\ncountries as those who had travelled them as bagmen.  On the Lion asking\nthe doctor what he meant, the Welshman, whose under jaw began to move\nviolently, replied, that he meant what he said.  Here the matter ended,\nfor the Lion, turning from him, looked at the writer.  The writer,\nimagining that his own conversation hitherto had been too trivial and\ncommon-place for the Lion to consider worth his while to take much notice\nof it, determined to assume a little higher ground, and after repeating a\nfew verses of the Koran, and gabbling a little Arabic, asked the Lion\nwhat he considered to be the difference between the Hegira and the\nChristian era, adding, that he thought the general computation was in\nerror by about one year; and being a particularly modest person, chiefly,\nhe believes, owing to his having been at school in Ireland, absolutely\nblushed at finding that the Lion returned not a word in answer.  \"What a\nwonderful individual I am seated by,\" thought he, \"to whom Arabic seems a\nvulgar speech, and a question about the Hegira not worthy of an answer!\"\nnot reflecting that as lions come from the Sahara, they have quite enough\nof Arabic at home, and that the question about the Hegira was rather mal\na propos to one used to prey on the flesh of hadjis.  \"Now I only wish he\nwould vouchsafe me a little of his learning,\" thought the boy to himself,\nand in this wish he was at last gratified; for the Lion, after asking him\nwhether he was acquainted at all with the Sclavonian languages, and being\ninformed that he was not, absolutely dumb-foundered him by a display of\nSclavonian erudition.\n\nYears rolled by--the writer was a good deal about, sometimes in London,\nsometimes in the country, sometimes abroad; in London he occasionally met\nthe man of the spectacles, who was always very civil to him, and, indeed,\ncultivated his acquaintance.  The writer thought it rather odd that,\nafter he himself had become acquainted with the Sclavonian languages and\nliterature, the man of the spectacles talked little or nothing about\nthem.  In a little time, however, the matter ceased to cause him the\nslightest surprise, for he had discovered a key to the mystery.  In the\nmean time the man of spectacles was busy enough; he speculated in\ncommerce, failed, and paid his creditors twenty pennies in the pound;\npublished translations, of which the public at length became heartily\ntired; having, indeed, got an inkling of the manner in which those\ntranslations were got up.  He managed, however, to ride out many a storm,\nhaving one trusty sheet-anchor--Radicalism.  This he turned to the best\nadvantage--writing pamphlets and articles in reviews, all in the Radical\ninterest, and for which he was paid out of the Radical fund; which\narticles and pamphlets, when Toryism seemed to reel on its last legs,\nexhibited a slight tendency to Whiggism.  Nevertheless, his abhorrence of\ndesertion of principle was so great in the time of the Duke of\nWellington's administration, that when S--- left the Whigs and went over,\nhe told the writer, who was about that time engaged with him in a\nliterary undertaking, that the said S--- was a fellow with a character so\ninfamous, that any honest man would rather that you spit in his face than\ninsult his ears with the mention of the name of S---.\n\nThe literary project having come to nothing,--in which, by the bye, the\nwriter was to have all the labour, and his friend all the credit,\nprovided any credit should accrue from it,--the writer did not see the\nlatter for some years, during which time considerable political changes\ntook place; the Tories were driven from, and the Whigs placed in, office,\nboth events being brought about by the Radicals coalescing with the\nWhigs, over whom they possessed great influence for the services which\nthey had rendered.  When the writer next visited his friend, he found him\nvery much altered; his opinions were by no means so exalted as they had\nbeen--he was not disposed even to be rancorous against the Duke of\nWellington, saying that there were worse men than he, and giving him some\ncredit as a general; a hankering after gentility seeming to pervade the\nwhole family, father and sons, wife and daughters, all of whom talked\nabout genteel diversions--gentility novels, and even seemed to look with\nfavour on High Churchism, having in former years, to all appearance, been\nbigoted Dissenters.  In a little time the writer went abroad; as, indeed,\ndid his friend; not, however, like the writer, at his own expense, but at\nthat of the country--the Whigs having given him a travelling appointment,\nwhich he held for some years, during which he received upwards of twelve\nthousand pounds of the money of the country, for services which will,\nperhaps, be found inscribed on certain tablets, when another Astolfo\nshall visit the moon.  This appointment, however, he lost on the Tories\nresuming power--when the writer found him almost as Radical and patriotic\nas ever, just engaged in trying to get into Parliament, into which he got\nby the assistance of his Radical friends, who, in conjunction with the\nWhigs, were just getting up a crusade against the Tories, which they\nintended should be a conclusive one.\n\nA little time after the publication of \"The Bible in Spain,\" the Tories\nbeing still in power, this individual, full of the most disinterested\nfriendship for the author, was particularly anxious that he should be\npresented with an official situation, in a certain region a great many\nmiles off.  \"You are the only person for that appointment,\" said he; \"you\nunderstand a great deal about the country, and are better acquainted with\nthe two languages spoken there than any one in England.  Now I love my\ncountry, and have, moreover, a great regard for you, and as I am in\nParliament, and have frequent opportunities of speaking to the Ministry,\nI shall take care to tell them how desirable it would be to secure your\nservices.  It is true they are Tories, but I think that even Tories would\ngive up their habitual love of jobbery in a case like yours, and for once\nshow themselves disposed to be honest men and gentlemen; indeed, I have\nno doubt they will, for having so deservedly an infamous character, they\nwould be glad to get themselves a little credit, by a presentation which\ncould not possibly be traced to jobbery or favouritism.\"\n\nThe writer begged his friend to give himself no trouble about the matter,\nas he was not desirous of the appointment, being in tolerably easy\ncircumstances, and willing to take some rest after a life of labour.  All,\nhowever, that he could say was of no use, his friend indignantly\nobserving, that the matter ought to be taken entirely out of his hands,\nand the appointment thrust upon him for the credit of the country.  \"But\nmay not many people be far more worthy of the appointment than myself?\"\nsaid the writer.  \"Where?\" said the friendly Radical.  \"If you don't get\nit, it will be made a job of, given to the son of some steward, or,\nperhaps, to some quack who has done dirty work; I tell you what, I shall\nask it for you, in spite of you; I shall, indeed!\" and his eyes flashed\nwith friendly and patriotic fervour through the large pair of spectacles\nwhich he wore.\n\nAnd, in fact, it would appear that the honest and friendly patriot put\nhis threat into execution.  \"I have spoken,\" said he, \"more than once to\nthis and that individual in Parliament, and everybody seems to think that\nthe appointment should be given to you.  Nay, that you should be forced\nto accept it.  I intend next to speak to Lord A---\"  And so he did, at\nleast it would appear so.  On the writer calling upon him one evening,\nabout a week afterwards, in order to take leave of him, as the writer was\nabout to take a long journey for the sake of his health, his friend no\nsooner saw him than he started up in a violent fit of agitation, and\nglancing about the room, in which there were several people, amongst\nothers two Whig members of Parliament, said, \"I am glad you are come, I\nwas just speaking about you.  This,\" said he, addressing the two members,\n\"is so and so, the author of so and so, the well-known philologist; as I\nwas telling you, I spoke to Lord A--- this day about him, and said that\nhe ought forthwith to have the head appointment in--and what did the\nfellow say?  Why, that there was no necessity for such an appointment at\nall, and if there were, why--and then he hummed and ha'd.  Yes,\" said he,\nlooking at the writer, \"he did indeed.  What a scandal! what an infamy!\nBut I see how it will be, it will be a job.  The place will be given to\nsome son of a steward or to some quack, as I said before.  Oh, these\nTories!  Well, if this does not make one--\"  Here he stopped short,\ncrunched his teeth, and looked the image of desperation.\n\nSeeing the poor man in this distressed condition, the writer begged him\nto be comforted, and not to take the matter so much to heart; but the\nindignant Radical took the matter very much to heart, and refused all\ncomfort whatever, bouncing about the room, and, whilst his spectacles\nflashed in the light of four spermaceti candles, exclaiming, \"It will be\na job--a Tory job!  I see it all, I see it all, I see it all!\"\n\nAnd a job it proved, and a very pretty job, but no Tory job.  Shortly\nafterwards the Tories were out, and the Whigs were in.  From that time\nthe writer heard not a word about the injustice done to the country in\nnot presenting him with the appointment to ---; the Radical, however, was\nbusy enough to obtain the appointment, not for the writer, but for\nhimself, and eventually succeeded, partly through Radical influence, and\npartly through that of a certain Whig lord, for whom the Radical had\ndone, on a particular occasion, work of a particular kind.  So, though\nthe place was given to a quack, and the whole affair a very pretty job,\nit was one in which the Tories had certainly no hand.\n\nIn the meanwhile, however, the friendly Radical did not drop the writer.\nOh, no!  On various occasions he obtained from the writer all the\ninformation about the country in question, and was particularly anxious\nto obtain from the writer, and eventually did obtain, a copy of a work\nwritten in the court language of that country, edited by the writer, a\nlanguage exceedingly difficult, which the writer, at the expense of a\nconsiderable portion of his eyesight, had acquired, at least as far as by\nthe eyesight it could be acquired.  What use the writer's friend made of\nthe knowledge he had gained from him, and what use he made of the book,\nthe writer can only guess; but he has little doubt that when the question\nof sending a person to --- was mooted in a Parliamentary Committee--which\nit was at the instigation of the writer's friend--the Radical on being\nexamined about the country, gave the information which he had obtained\nfrom the writer as his own, and flashed the book and its singular\ncharacters in the eyes of the Committee; and then of course his Radical\nfriends would instantly say, \"This is the man! there is no one like him.\nSee what information he possesses; and see that book written by himself\nin the court language of Serendib.  This is the only man to send there.\nWhat a glory, what a triumph it would be to Britain, to send out a man so\ndeeply versed in the mysterious lore of--as our illustrious countryman; a\nperson who with his knowledge could beat with their own weapons the wise\nmen of-- Is such an opportunity to be lost?  Oh, no! surely not; if it\nis, it will be an eternal disgrace to England, and the world will see\nthat Whigs are no better than Tories.\"\n\nLet no one think the writer uncharitable in these suppositions.  The\nwriter is only too well acquainted with the antecedents of the\nindividual, to entertain much doubt that he would shrink from any such\nconduct, provided he thought that his temporal interest would be\nforwarded by it.  The writer is aware of more than one instance in which\nhe has passed off the literature of friendless young men for his own,\nafter making them a slight pecuniary compensation and deforming what was\noriginally excellent by interpolations of his own.  This was his especial\npractice with regard to translation, of which he would fain be esteemed\nthe king.  This Radical literato is slightly acquainted with four or five\nof the easier dialects of Europe, on the strength of which knowledge he\nwould fain pass for a universal linguist, publishing translations of\npieces originally written in various difficult languages; which\ntranslations, however, were either made by himself from literal\nrenderings done for him into French or German, or had been made from the\noriginals into English, by friendless young men, and then deformed by his\nalterations.\n\nWell, the Radical got the appointment, and the writer certainly did not\ngrudge it him.  He, of course, was aware that his friend had behaved in a\nvery base manner towards him, but he bore him no ill-will, and invariably\nwhen he heard him spoken against, which was frequently the case, took his\npart when no other person would; indeed, he could well afford to bear him\nno ill-will.  He had never sought for the appointment, nor wished for it,\nnor, indeed, ever believed himself to be qualified for it.  He was\nconscious, it is true, that he was not altogether unacquainted with the\nlanguage and literature of the country with which the appointment was\nconnected.  He was likewise aware that he was not altogether deficient in\ncourage and in propriety of behaviour.  He knew that his appearance was\nnot particularly against him; his face not being like that of a convicted\npickpocket, nor his gait resembling that of a fox who has lost his tail;\nyet he never believed himself adapted for the appointment, being aware\nthat he had no aptitude for the doing of dirty work, if called to do it,\nnor pliancy which would enable him to submit to scurvy treatment, whether\nhe did dirty work or not--requisites, at the time of which he is\nspeaking, indispensable in every British official; requisites, by the\nbye, which his friend the Radical possessed in a high degree; but though\nhe bore no ill-will towards his friend, his friend bore anything but good-\nwill towards him; for from the moment that he had obtained the\nappointment for himself, his mind was filled with the most bitter\nmalignity against the writer, and naturally enough; for no one ever yet\nbehaved in a base manner towards another, without forthwith conceiving a\nmortal hatred against him.  You wrong another, know yourself to have\nacted basely, and are enraged, not against yourself--for no one hates\nhimself--but against the innocent cause of your baseness; reasoning very\nplausibly, \"But for that fellow, I should never have been base; for had\nhe not existed I could not have been so, at any rate against him;\" and\nthis hatred is all the more bitter, when you reflect that you have been\nneedlessly base.\n\nWhilst the Tories are in power the writer's friend, of his own accord,\nraves against the Tories because they do not give the writer a certain\nappointment, and makes, or says he makes, desperate exertions to make\nthem do so; but no sooner are the Tories out, with whom he has no\ninfluence, and the Whigs in, with whom he, or rather his party, has\ninfluence, than he gets the place for himself, though, according to his\nown expressed opinion--an opinion with which the writer does not, and\nnever did, concur--the writer was the only person competent to hold it.\nNow had he, without saying a word to the writer, or about the writer with\nrespect to the employment, got the place for himself when he had an\nopportunity, knowing, as he very well knew, himself to be utterly\nunqualified for it, the transaction, though a piece of jobbery, would not\nhave merited the title of a base transaction; as the matter stands,\nhowever, who can avoid calling the whole affair not only a piece of--come,\ncome, out with the word--scoundrelism on the part of the writer's friend,\nbut a most curious piece of uncalled-for scoundrelism? and who, with any\nknowledge of fallen human nature, can wonder at the writer's friend\nentertaining towards him a considerable portion of gall and malignity?\n\nThis feeling on the part of the writer's friend was wonderfully increased\nby the appearance of Lavengro, many passages of which the Radical in his\nforeign appointment applied to himself and family--one or two of his\nchildren having gone over to Popery, the rest become members of Mr.\nPlatitude's chapel, and the minds of all being filled with ultra notions\nof gentility.\n\nThe writer, hearing that his old friend had returned to England, to\napply, he believes, for an increase of salary, and for a title, called\nupon him, unwillingly, it is true, for he had no wish to see a person for\nwhom, though he bore him no ill-will, he could not avoid feeling a\nconsiderable portion of contempt; the truth is, that his sole object in\ncalling was to endeavour to get back a piece of literary property which\nhis friend had obtained from him many years previously, and which, though\nhe had frequently applied for it, he never could get back.  Well, the\nwriter called; he did not get his property, which, indeed, he had\nscarcely time to press for, being almost instantly attacked by his good\nfriend and his wife--yes, it was then that the author was set upon by an\nold Radical and his wife--the wife, who looked the very image of shame\nand malignity, did not say much, it is true, but encouraged her husband\nin all he said.  Both of their own accord introduced the subject of\nLavengro.  The Radical called the writer a grumbler, just as if there had\never been a greater grumbler than himself until, by the means above\ndescribed, he had obtained a place: he said that the book contained a\nmelancholy view of human nature--just as if anybody could look in his\nface without having a melancholy view of human nature.  On the writer\nquietly observing that the book contained an exposition of his\nprinciples, the pseudo-Radical replied, that he cared nothing for his\nprinciples--which was probably true, it not being likely that he would\ncare for another person's principles after having shown so thorough a\ndisregard for his own.  The writer said that the book, of course, would\ngive offence to humbugs; the Radical then demanded whether he thought him\na humbug?--the wretched wife was the Radical's protection, even as he\nknew she would be; it was on her account that the writer did not kick his\ngood friend; as it was, he looked at him in the face and thought to\nhimself, \"How is it possible I should think you a humbug, when only last\nnight I was taking your part in a company in which everybody called you a\nhumbug?\"\n\nThe Radical, probably observing something in the writer's eye which he\ndid not like, became all on a sudden abjectly submissive, and, professing\nthe highest admiration for the writer, begged him to visit him in his\ngovernment; this the writer promised faithfully to do, and he takes the\npresent opportunity of performing his promise.\n\nThis is one of the pseudo-Radical calumniators of Lavengro and its\nauthor; were the writer on his deathbed he would lay his hand on his\nheart and say, that he does not believe that there is one trait of\nexaggeration in the portrait which he has drawn.  This is one of the\npseudo-Radical calumniators of Lavengro and its author; and this is one\nof the genus, who, after having railed against jobbery for perhaps a\nquarter of a century, at present batten on large official salaries which\nthey do not earn.  England is a great country, and her interests require\nthat she should have many a well-paid official both at home and abroad;\nbut will England long continue a great country if the care of her\ninterests, both at home and abroad, is in many instances intrusted to\nbeings like him described above, whose only recommendation for an\nofficial appointment was that he was deeply versed in the secrets of his\nparty and of the Whigs?\n\nBefore he concludes, the writer will take the liberty of saying of\nLavengro that it is a book written for the express purpose of inculcating\nvirtue, love of country, learning, manly pursuits, and genuine religion,\nfor example, that of the Church of England, and for awakening a contempt\nfor nonsense of every kind, and a hatred for priestcraft, more especially\nthat of Rome.\n\nAnd in conclusion, with respect to many passages of his book in which he\nhas expressed himself in terms neither measured nor mealy, he will beg\nleave to observe, in the words of a great poet, who lived a profligate\nlife, it is true, but who died a sincere penitent--thanks, after God, to\ngood Bishop Burnet--\n\n   \"All this with indignation I have hurl'd\n   At the pretending part of this proud world,\n   Who, swollen with selfish vanity, devise\n   False freedoms, formal cheats, and holy lies,\n   Over their fellow fools to tyrannize.\"\n\n   ROCHESTER.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n{1}  Tipperary.\n\n{2}  An obscene oath.\n\n{3}  See \"Muses' Library,\" pp. 86, 87.  London, 1738.\n\n{4}  Genteel with them seems to be synonymous with Gentile and Gentoo; if\nso, the manner in which it has been applied for ages ceases to surprise,\nfor genteel is heathenish.  Ideas of barbaric pearl and gold, glittering\narmour, plumes, tortures, blood-shedding, and lust, should always be\nconnected with it.  Wace, in his grand Norman poem, calls the Baron\ngenteel:--\n\n   \"La furent li gentil Baron,\" etc.\n\nAnd he certainly could not have applied the word better than to the\nstrong Norman thief, armed cap-a-pie, without one particle of truth or\ngenerosity; for a person to be a pink of gentility, that is heathenism,\nshould have no such feelings; and, indeed, the admirers of gentility\nseldom or never associate any such feelings with it.  It was from the\nNorman, the worst of all robbers and miscreants, who built strong\ncastles, garrisoned them with devils, and tore out poor wretches' eyes,\nas the Saxon Chronicle says, that the English got their detestable word\ngenteel.  What could ever have made the English such admirers of\ngentility, it would be difficult to say; for, during three hundred years,\nthey suffered enough by it.  Their genteel Norman landlords were their\nscourgers, their torturers, the plunderers of their homes, the\ndishonourers of their wives, and the deflourers of their daughters.\nPerhaps, after all, fear is at the root of the English veneration for\ngentility.\n\n{5}  Gentle and gentlemanly may be derived from the same root as genteel;\nbut nothing can be more distinct from the mere genteel, than the ideas\nwhich enlightened minds associate with these words.  Gentle and\ngentlemanly mean something kind and genial; genteel, that which is\nglittering or gaudy.  A person can be a gentleman in rags, but nobody can\nbe genteel.\n\n{6}  The writer has been checked in print by the Scotch with being a\nNorfolk man.  Surely, surely, these latter times have not been exactly\nthe ones in which it was expedient for Scotchmen to check the children of\nany county in England with the place of their birth, more especially\nthose who have had the honour of being born in Norfolk--times in which\nBritish fleets, commanded by Scotchmen, have returned laden with anything\nbut laurels from foreign shores.  It would have been well for Britain had\nshe had the old Norfolk man to dispatch to the Baltic or the Black sea,\nlately, instead of Scotch admirals.\n\n{7}  As the present work will come out in the midst of a vehement\npolitical contest, people may be led to suppose that the above was\nwritten expressly for the time.  The writer therefore begs to state that\nit was written in the year 1854.  He cannot help adding that he is\nneither Whig, Tory, nor Radical, and cares not a straw what party governs\nEngland, provided it is governed well.  But he has no hopes of good\ngovernment from the Whigs.  It is true that amongst them there is one\nvery great man, Lord Palmerston, who is indeed the sword and buckler, the\nchariots and the horses of the party; but it is impossible for his\nlordship to govern well with such colleagues as he has--colleagues which\nhave been forced upon him by family influence, and who are continually\npestering him into measures anything but conducive to the country's\nhonour and interest.  If Palmerston would govern well, he must get rid of\nthem; but from that step, with all his courage and all his greatness, he\nwill shrink.  Yet how proper and easy a step it would be!  He could\neasily get better, but scarcely worse, associates.  They appear to have\none object in view, and only one--jobbery.  It was chiefly owing to a\nmost flagitious piece of jobbery, which one of his lordship's principal\ncolleagues sanctioned and promoted, that his lordship experienced his\nlate parliamentary disasters.\n\n{8}  A fact."
