On that occasion the poet and\nthe philosopher had talked together well into the small hours of the\nmorning. My father asked Tennyson what was the subject of conversation\nthat had so engrossed them. \"Murders,\" replied Tennyson. It would have\nbeen interesting to have heard Tennyson and Jowett discussing such a\ntheme. The fact is a tribute to the interest that crime has for many\nmen of intellect and imagination. Indeed, how could it be otherwise?\nRob history and fiction of crime, how tame and colourless would be the\nresidue! We who are living and enduring in the presence of one of the\ngreatest crimes on record, must realise that trying as this period of\nthe world's history is to those who are passing through it, in the hands\nof some great historian it may make very good reading for posterity.\nPerhaps we may find some little consolation in this fact, like the\nunhappy victims of famous freebooters such as Jack Sheppard or Charley\nPeace.\n\nBut do not let us flatter ourselves. Do not let us, in all the pomp and\ncircumstance of stately history, blind ourselves to the fact that the\ncrimes of Frederick, or Napoleon, or their successors, are in essence no\ndifferent from those of Sheppard or Peace. We must not imagine that\nthe bad man who happens to offend against those particular laws which\nconstitute the criminal code belongs to a peculiar or atavistic type,\nthat he is a man set apart from the rest of his fellow-men by mental or\nphysical peculiarities. That comforting theory of the Lombroso school\nhas been exploded, and the ordinary inmates of our prisons shown to be\nonly in a very slight degree below the average in mental and physical\nfitness of the normal man, a difference easily explained by the\nenvironment and conditions in which the ordinary criminal is bred.\n\nA certain English judge, asked as to the general characteristics of the\nprisoners tried before him, said: \"They are just like other people;\nin fact, I often think that, but for different opportunities and other\naccidents, the prisoner and I might very well be in one another's\nplaces.\" \"Greed, love of pleasure,\" writes a French judge, \"lust,\nidleness, anger, hatred, revenge, these are the chief causes of crime.\nThese passions and desires are shared by rich and poor alike, by the\neducated and uneducated. They are inherent in human nature; the germ is\nin every man.\"\n\nConvicts represent those wrong-doers who have taken to a particular form\nof wrong-doing punishable by law. Of the larger army of bad men\nthey represent a minority, who have been found out in a peculiarly\nunsatisfactory kind of misconduct. There are many men, some lying,\nunscrupulous, dishonest, others cruel, selfish, vicious, who go through\nlife without ever doing anything that brings them within the scope of\nthe criminal code, for whose offences the laws of society provide no\npunishment. And so it is with some of those heroes of history who have\nbeen made the theme of fine writing by gifted historians.\n\nMr. Basil Thomson, the present head of the Criminal Investigation\nDepartment, has said recently that a great deal of crime is due to a\nspirit of \"perverse adventure\" on the part of the criminal. The same\nmight be said with equal justice of the exploits of Alexander the Great\nand half the monarchs and conquerors of the world, whom we are taught\nin our childhood's days to look up to as shining examples of all that a\ngreat man should be. Because crimes are played on a great stage instead\nof a small, that is no reason why our moral judgment should be suspended\nor silenced. Class Machiavelli and Frederick the Great as a couple of\nrascals fit to rank with Jonathan Wild, and we are getting nearer a\nperception of what constitutes the real criminal. \"If,\" said Frederick\nthe Great to his minister, Radziwill, \"there is anything to be gained\nby it, we will be honest; if deception is necessary, let us be cheats.\"\nThese are the very sentiments of Jonathan Wild.\n\nCrime, broadly speaking, is the attempt by fraud or violence to possess\noneself of something belonging to another, and as such the cases of it\nin history are as clear as those dealt with in criminal courts. Germany\nto-day has been guilty of a perverse and criminal adventure, the outcome\nof that false morality applied to historical transactions, of which\nCarlyle's life of Frederick is a monumental example. In that book\nwe have a man whose instincts in more ways than one were those of a\ncriminal, held up for our admiration, in the same way that the same\nwriter fell into dithyrambic praise over a villain called Francia, a\nformer President of Paraguay. A most interesting work might be written\non the great criminals of history, and might do something towards\nrestoring that balance of moral judgment in historical transactions, for\nthe perversion of which we are suffering to-day.\n\nIn the meantime we must be content to study in the microcosm of ordinary\ncrime those instincts, selfish, greedy, brutal which, exploited often\nby bad men in the so-called cause of nations, have wrought such havoc\nto the happiness of mankind. It is not too much to say that in every\nman there dwell the seeds of crime; whether they grow or are stifled\nin their growth by the good that is in us is a chance mysteriously\ndetermined. As children of nature we must not be surprised if our\ninstincts are not all that they should be. \"In sober truth,\" writes\nJohn Stuart Mill, \"nearly all the things for which men are hanged or\nimprisoned for doing to one another are nature's everyday performances,\"\nand in another passage: \"The course of natural phenomena being replete\nwith everything which when committed by human beings is most worthy of\nabhorrence, anyone who endeavoured in his actions to imitate the natural\ncourse of things would be universally seen and acknowledged to be the\nwickedest of men.\"\n\nHere is explanation enough for the presence of evil in our natures, that\ninstinct to destroy which finds comparatively harmless expression in\ncertain forms of taking life, which is at its worst when we fall\nto taking each other's. It is to check an inconvenient form of the\nexpression of this instinct that we punish murderers with death. We must\ncarry the definition of murder a step farther before we can count\non peace or happiness in this world. We must concentrate all our\nstrength on fighting criminal nature, both in ourselves and in the\nworld around us. With the destructive forces of nature we are waging a\nperpetual struggle for our very existence. Why dissipate our strength by\nfighting among ourselves? By enlarging our conception of crime we move\ntowards that end. What is anti-social, whether it be written in the\npages of the historian or those of the Newgate Calendar, must in the\nfuture be regarded with equal abhorrence and subjected to equally sure\npunishment. Every professor of history should now and then climb down\nfrom the giddy heights of Thucydides and Gibbon and restore his moral\nbalance by comparing the acts of some of his puppets with those of their\nless fortunate brethren who have dangled at the end of a rope. If this\nwar is to mean anything to posterity, the crime against humanity must be\njudged in the future by the same rigid standard as the crime against the\nperson.\n\nThe individual criminals whose careers are given in this book have been\nchosen from among their fellows for their pre-eminence in character or\nachievement. Some of the cases, such as Butler, Castaing and Holmes, are\nnew to most English readers.\n\nCharles Peace is the outstanding popular figure in nineteenth-century\ncrime. He is the type of the professional criminal who makes crime a\nbusiness and sets about it methodically and persistently to the end.\nHere is a man, possessing many of those qualities which go to make the\nsuccessful man of action in all walks of life, driven by circumstances\nto squander them on a criminal career. Yet it is a curious circumstance\nthat this determined and ruthless burglar should have suffered for what\nwould be classed in France as a \"crime passionel.\" There is more than\na possibility that a French jury would have found extenuating circumstances in the murder of Dyson. The fate of Peace is only another instance of the wrecking a strong man's career by his passion for a woman. In Albert Butler we have the criminal by conviction, a conviction which finds the ground ready prepared\nfor its growth in the natural laziness and idleness of the man's\ndisposition. The desire to acquire things by a short cut, without taking\nthe trouble to work for them honestly, is perhaps the most fruitful of\nall sources of crime. Butler, a bit of a pedant, is pleased to\njustify his conduct by reason and philosophy--he finds in the acts of\nunscrupulous monarchs an analogy to his own attitude towards life. What\nis good enough for Caesar Borgia is good enough for Robert Butler. Like\nBorgia he comes to grief; criminals succeed and criminals fail. In the\ncase of historical criminals their crimes are open; we can estimate the\nsuccesses and failures. With ordinary criminals, we know only those\nwho fail. The successful, the real geniuses in crime, those whose guilt\nremains undiscovered, are for the most part unknown to us. Occasionally\nin society a man or woman is pointed out as having once murdered\nsomebody or other, and at times, no doubt, with truth. But the matter\ncan only be referred to clandestinely; they are gazed at with awe or\ncuriosity, mute witnesses to their own achievement. Some years ago James\nPayn, the novelist, hazarded the reckoning that one person in every five\nhundred was an undiscovered murderer. This gives us all a hope, almost\na certainty, that we may reckon one such person at least among our\nacquaintances.(1)\n\n\n     (1) The author was one of three men discussing this subject in a London\nclub. They were able to name six persons of their various acquaintance\nwho were, or had been, suspected of being successful murderers.\n\n\nDerues is remarkable for the extent of his social ambition, the daring\nand impudent character of his attempts to gratify it, the skill, the\nconsummate hypocrisy with which he played on the credulity of honest\nfolk, and his flagrant employment of that weapon known and recognised\nto-day in the most exalted spheres by the expressive name of \"bluff.\"\nHe is remarkable, too, for his mirth and high spirits, his genial\nbuffoonery; the merry murderer is a rare bird.\n\nProfessor Webster belongs to that order of criminal of which Eugene Aram\nand the Rev. John Selby Watson are our English examples, men of culture\nand studious habits who suddenly burst on the astonished gaze of\ntheir fellowmen as murderers. The exact process of mind by which these\nhitherto harmless citizens are converted into assassins is to a great\nextent hidden from us.\n\nPerhaps Webster's case is the clearest of the three. Here we have a\nselfish, self-indulgent and spendthrift gentleman who has landed himself\nin serious financial embarrassment, seeking by murder to escape from an\nimportunate and relentless creditor. He has not, apparently, the moral\ncourage to face the consequences of his own weakness. He forgets the\nhappiness of his home, the love of those dear to him, in the desire to\nfree himself from a disgrace insignificent{sic} in comparison with that\nentailed by committing the highest of all crimes. One would wish to\nbelieve that Webster's deed was unpremeditated, the result of a sudden\ngust of passion caused by his victim's acrimonious pursuit of his\ndebtor. But there are circumstances in the case which tell powerfully\nagainst such a view. The character of the murderer seems curiously\ncontradictory; both cunning and simplicity mark his proceedings; he\nmakes a determined attempt to escape from the horrors of his situation\nand shows at the same time a curious insensibility to its real gravity.\nWebster was a man of refined tastes and seemingly gentle character,\nloved by those near to him, well liked by his friends.\n\nThe mystery that surrounds the real character of Eugene Aram is greater,\nand we possess little or no means of solving it. From what motive this\nsilent, arrogant man, despising his ineffectual wife, this reserved and\nmoody scholar stooped to fraud and murder the facts of the case help us\nlittle to determine. Was it the hope of leaving the narrow surroundings\nof Knaresborough, his tiresome belongings, his own poor way of life,\nand seeking a wider field for the exercise of those gifts of scholarship\nwhich he undoubtedly possessed that drove him to commit fraud in company\nwith Clark and Houseman, and then, with the help of the latter,\nmurder the unsuspecting Clark? The fact of his humble origin makes\nhis association with so low a ruffian as Houseman the less remarkable.\nVanity in all probability played a considerable part in Aram's\ndisposition. He would seem to have thought himself a superior person,\nabove the laws that bind ordinary men. He showed at the end no\nconsciousness of his guilt. Being something of a philosopher, he had\nno doubt constructed for himself a philosophy of life which served to\njustify his own actions. He was a deist, believing in \"one almighty\nBeing the God of Nature,\" to whom he recommended himself at the last in\nthe event of his \"having done amiss.\" He emphasised the fact that his\nlife had been unpolluted and his morals irreproachable. But his views\nas to the murder of Clark he left unexpressed. He suggested as\njustification of it that Clark had carried on an intrigue with his\nneglected wife, but he never urged this circumstance in his defence, and\nbeyond his own statement there is no evidence of such a connection.\n\nThe Revd. John Selby Watson, headmaster of the Stockwell Grammar School,\nat the age of sixty-five killed his wife in his library one Sunday\nafternoon. Things had been going badly with the unfortunate man. After\nmore than twenty-five years' service as headmaster of the school at a\nmeagre salary of L400 a year, he was about to be dismissed; the\nnumber of scholars had been declining steadily and a change in the\nheadmastership thought necessary; there was no suggestion of his\nreceiving any kind of pension. The future for a man of his years\nwas dark enough. The author of several learned books, painstaking,\nscholarly, dull, he could hope to make but little money from literary\nwork. Under a cold, reserved and silent exterior, Selby Watson concealed\na violence of temper which he sought diligently to repress. His wife's\ntemper was none of the best. Worried, depressed, hopeless of his future,\nhe in all probability killed his wife in a sudden access of rage,\nprovoked by some taunt or reproach on her part, and then, instead of\ncalling in a policeman and telling him what he had done, made clumsy and\nineffectual efforts to conceal his crime. Medical opinion was divided as\nto his mental condition. Those doctors called for the prosecution could\nfind no trace of insanity about him, those called for the defence said\nthat he was suffering from melancholia. The unhappy man would appear\nhardly to have realised the gravity of his situation. To a friend who\nvisited him in prison he said: \"Here's a man who can write Latin, which\nthe Bishop of Winchester would commend, shut up in a place like this.\"\nComing from a man who had spent all his life buried in books and knowing\nlittle of the world the remark is not so greatly to be wondered at.\nProfound scholars are apt to be impatient of mundane things. Professor\nWebster showed a similar want of appreciation of the circumstances of a\nperson charged with wilful murder. Selby Watson was convicted of murder\nand sentenced to death. The sentence was afterwards commuted to one of\npenal servitude for life, the Home Secretary of the day showing by\nhis decision that, though not satisfied of the prisoner's insanity, he\nrecognised certain extenuating circumstances in his guilt.(2)\n\n\n     (2) Selby Watson was tried at the Central Criminal Court January, 1872.\n\n\nIn Castaing much ingenuity is shown in the conception of the crime,\nbut the man is weak and timid; he is not the stuff of which the great\ncriminal is made; Holmes is cast in the true mould of the instinctive\nmurderer. Castaing is a man of sensibility, capable of domestic\naffection; Holmes completely insensible to all feelings of humanity.\nTaking life is a mere incident in the accomplishment of his schemes;\nmen, women and children are sacrificed with equal mercilessness to the\nnecessary end. A consummate liar and hypocrite, he has that strange\npower of fascination over others, women in particular, which is often\nindependent altogether of moral or even physical attractiveness. We\nare accustomed to look for a certain vastness, grandeur of scale in the\nachievements of America. A study of American crime will show that it\ndoes not disappoint us in this expectation. The extent and audacity of\nthe crimes of Holmes are proof of it.\n\nTo find a counterpart in imaginative literature to the complete criminal\nof the Holmes type we must turn to the pages of Shakespeare. In the\nnumber of his victims, the cruelty and insensibility with which he\nattains his ends, his unblushing hypocrisy, the fascination he can\nexercise at will over others, the Richard III. of Shakespeare shows how\nclearly the poet understood the instinctive criminal of real life. The\nRichard of history was no doubt less instinctively and deliberately an\nassassin than the Richard of Shakespeare. In the former we can trace\nthe gradual temptation to crime to which circumstances provoke him. The\nmurder of the Princes, if, as one writer contends, it was not the work\nof Henry VII.--in which case that monarch deserves to be hailed as\none of the most consummate criminals that ever breathed and the worthy\nfather of a criminal son--was no doubt forced to a certain extent on\nRichard by the exigencies of his situation, one of those crimes to which\nbad men are driven in order to secure the fruits of other crimes. But\nthe Richard of Shakespeare is no child of circumstance. He espouses\ndeliberately a career of crime, as deliberately as Peace or Holmes or\nButler; he sets out \"determined to prove a villain,\" to be \"subtle,\nfalse and treacherous,\" to employ to gain his ends \"stern murder in the\ndir'st degree.\" The character is sometimes criticised as being overdrawn\nand unreal. It may not be true to the Richard of history, but it is very\ntrue to crime, and to the historical criminal of the Borgian or Prussian\ntype, in which fraud and violence are made part of a deliberate system\nof so-called statecraft.\n\nShakespeare got nearer to what we may term the domestic as opposed to\nthe political criminal when he created Iago. In their envy and dislike\nof their fellowmen, their contempt for humanity in general, their\ncallousness to the ordinary sympathies of human nature, Robert Butler,\nLacenaire, Ruloff are witnesses to the poet's fidelity to criminal\ncharacter in his drawing of the Ancient. But there is a weakness in\nthe character of Iago regarded as a purely instinctive and malignant\ncriminal; indeed it is a weakness in the consistency of the play. On two\noccasions Iago states explicitly that Othello is more than suspected of\nhaving committed adultery with his wife, Emilia, and that therefore he\nhas a strong and justifiable motive for being revenged on the Moor.\nThe thought of it he describes as \"gnawing his inwards.\" Emilia's\nconversation with Desdemona in the last act lends some colour to the\ncorrectness of Iago's belief. If this belief be well-founded it\nmust greatly modify his character as a purely wanton and mischievous\ncriminal, a supreme villain, and lower correspondingly the character\nof Othello as an honourable and high-minded man. If it be a morbid\nsuspicion, having no ground in fact, a mental obsession, then Iago\nbecomes abnormal and consequently more or less irresponsible. But this\nsuggestion of Emilia's faithlessness made in the early part of the play\nis never followed up by the dramatist, and the spectator is left in\ncomplete uncertainty as to whether there be any truth or not in\nIago's suspicion. If Othello has played his Ancient false, that is an\nextenuating circumstance in the otherwise extraordinary guilt of Iago,\nand would no doubt be accorded to him as such, were he on trial before a\nFrench jury.\n\nThe most successful, and therefore perhaps the greatest, criminal in\nShakespeare is King Claudius of Denmark. His murder of his brother by\npouring a deadly poison into his ear while sleeping, is so skilfully\nperpetrated as to leave no suspicion of foul play. But for a\nsupernatural intervention, a contingency against which no murderer could\nbe expected to have provided, the crime of Claudius would never have\nbeen discovered. Smiling, jovial, genial as M. Derues or Dr. Palmer,\nKing Claudius might have gone down to his grave in peace as the bluff\nhearty man of action, while his introspective nephew would in all\nprobability have ended his days in the cloister, regarded with amiable\ncontempt by his bustling fellowmen. How Claudius got over the great\ndifficulty of all poisoners, that of procuring the necessary poison\nwithout detection, we are not told; by what means he distilled the\n\"juice of cursed hebenon\"; how the strange appearance of the late\nKing's body, which \"an instant tetter\" had barked about with \"vile and\nloathsome crust,\" was explained to the multitude we are left to imagine.\nThere is no real evidence to show that Queen Gertrude was her lover's\naccomplice in her husband's murder. If that had been so, she would\nno doubt have been of considerable assistance to Claudius in the\npreparation of the crime. But in the absence of more definite proof\nwe must assume Claudius' murder of his brother to have been a solitary\nachievement, skilfully carried out by one whose genial good-fellowship\nand convivial habits gave the lie to any suggestion of criminality.\nWhatever may have been his inward feelings of remorse or self-reproach,\nClaudius masked them successfully from the eyes of all. Hamlet's\ninstinctive dislike of his uncle was not shared by the members of the\nDanish court. The \"witchcraft of his wit,\" his \"traitorous gifts,\"\nwere powerful aids to Claudius, not only in the seduction of his\nsister-in-law, but the perpetration of secret murder.\n\nThe case of the murder of King Duncan of Scotland by Macbeth and his\nwife belongs to a different class of crime. It is a striking example of\ndual crime, four instances of which are given towards the end of this\nbook. An Italian advocate, Scipio Sighele, has devoted a monograph to\nthe subject of dual crime, in which he examines a number of cases in\nwhich two persons have jointly committed heinous crimes.(3) He finds\nthat in couples of this kind there is usually an incubus and a succubus,\nthe one who suggests the crime, the other on whom the suggestion works\nuntil he or she becomes the accomplice or instrument of the stronger\nwill; \"the one playing the Mephistophelian part of tempter, preaching\nevil, urging to crime, the other allowing himself to be overcome by his\nevil genius.\" In some cases these two roles are clearly differentiated;\nit is easy, as in the case of Iago and Othello, Cassius and Brutus, to\nsay who prompted the crime. In others the guilt seems equally divided\nand the original suggestion of crime to spring from a mutual tendency\ntowards the adoption of such an expedient. In Macbeth and his wife we\nhave a perfect instance of the latter class. No sooner have the witches\nprophesied that Macbeth shall be a king than the \"horrid image\" of\nthe suggestion to murder Duncan presents itself to his mind, and, on\nreturning to his wife, he answers her question as to when Duncan is\nto leave their house by the significant remark, \"To-morrow--as he\nproposes.\" To Lady Macbeth from the moment she has received her\nhusband's letter telling of the prophecy of the weird sisters, murder\noccurs as a means of accomplishing their prediction. In the minds\nof Macbeth and his wife the suggestion of murder is originally an\nauto-suggestion, coming to them independently of each other as soon as\nthey learn from the witches that Macbeth is one day to be a king. To\nBanquo a somewhat similar intimation is given, but no foul thought of\ncrime suggests itself for an instant to his loyal nature. What Macbeth\nand his wife lack at first as thorough-going murderers is that complete\ninsensibility to taking human life that marks the really ruthless\nassassin. Lady Macbeth has the stronger will of the two for the\ncommission of the deed. It is doubtful whether without her help Macbeth\nwould ever have undertaken it. But even she, when her husband hesitates\nto strike, cannot bring herself to murder the aged Duncan with her own\nhands because of his resemblance as he sleeps to her father. It is only\nafter a deal of boggling and at serious risk of untimely interruption\nthat the two contrive to do the murder, and plaster with blood the\n\"surfeited grooms.\" In thus putting suspicion on the servants of Duncan\nthe assassins cunningly avert suspicion from themselves, and Macbeth's\nkilling of the unfortunate men in seeming indignation at the discovery\nof their crime is a master-stroke of ingenuity. \"Who,\" he asks in a\nsplendid burst of feigned horror, \"can be wise, amazed, temperate and\nfurious, loyal and natural in a moment?\" At the same time Lady Macbeth\naffects to swoon away in the presence of so awful a crime. For the time\nall suspicion of guilt, except in the mind of Banquo, is averted from\nthe real murderers. But, like so many criminals, Macbeth finds it\nimpossible to rest on his first success in crime. His sensibility grows\ndulled; he \"forgets the taste of fear\"; the murder of Banquo and his\nson is diabolically planned, and that is soon followed by the outrageous\nslaughter of the wife and children of Macduff. Ferri, the Italian writer\non crime, describes the psychical condition favourable to the commission\nof murder as an absence of both moral repugnance to the crime itself and\nthe fear of the consequences following it. In the murder of Duncan, it\nis the first of these two states of mind to which Macbeth and his wife\nhave only partially attained. The moral repugnance stronger in the\nman has not been wholly lost by the woman. But as soon as the crime is\nsuccessfully accomplished, this repugnance begins to wear off until the\nKing and Queen are able calmly and deliberately to contemplate those\nfurther crimes necessary to their peace of mind. But now Macbeth, at\nfirst the more compunctious of the two, has become the more ruthless;\nthe germ of crime, developed by suggestion, has spread through his whole\nbeing; he has begun to acquire that indifference to human suffering with\nwhich Richard III. and Iago were gifted from the first. In both\nMacbeth and Lady Macbeth the germ of crime was latent; they wanted only\nfavourable circumstances to convert them into one of those criminal\ncouples who are the more dangerous for the fact that the temptation\nto crime has come to each spontaneously and grown and been fostered by\nmutual understanding, an elective affinity for evil. Such couples are\nfrequent in the history of crime. Eyraud and Bompard, Mr. and Mrs.\nManning, Burke and Hare, the Peltzer brothers, Barre and Lebiez, are\ninstances of those collaborations in crime which find their counterpart\nin history, literature, drama and business. Antoninus and Aurelius,\nFerdinand and Isabella, the De Goncourt brothers, Besant and Rice,\nGilbert and Sullivan, Swan and Edgar leap to the memory.\n\n\n     (3) \"Le Crime a Deux,\" by Scipio Sighele (translated from the Italian),\nLyons, 1893.\n\nIn the cases of Eyraud and Bompard, both man and woman are idle, vicious\ncriminals by instinct. They come together, lead an abandoned life,\nsinking lower and lower in moral degradation. In the hour of need, crime\npresents itself as a simple expedient for which neither of them has any\nnatural aversion. The repugnance to evil, if they ever felt it, has\nlong since disappeared from their natures. The man is serious, the woman\nfrivolous, but the criminal tendency in both cases is the same; each\nperforms his or her part in the crime with characteristic aptitude.\nMrs. Manning was a creature of much firmer character than her husband,\na woman of strong passions, a redoubtable murderess. Without her\ndominating force Manning might never have committed murder. But he was a\ncriminal before the crime, more than suspected as a railway official of\ncomplicity in a considerable train robbery; in his case the suggestion\nof murder involved only the taking of a step farther in a criminal\ncareer. Manning suffered from nerves almost as badly as Macbeth; after\nthe deed he sought to drown the prickings of terror and remorse by heavy\ndrinking Mrs. Manning was never troubled with any feelings of this kind;\nafter the murder of O'Connor the gratification of her sexual passion\nseemed uppermost in her mind; and she met the consequences of her crime\nfearlessly. Burke and Hare were a couple of ruffians, tempted by what\nmust have seemed almost fabulous wealth to men of their wretched\npoverty to commit a series of cruel murders. Hare, with his queer,\nMephistophelian countenance, was the wickeder of the two. Burke became\nhaunted as time went on and flew to drink to banish horror, but Hare\nwould seem to have been free from such \"compunctious visitings of\nNature.\" He kept his head and turned King's evidence.\n\nIn the case of the Peltzer brothers we have a man who is of good social\nposition, falling desperately in love with the wife of a successful\nbarrister. The wife, though unhappy in her domestic life, refuses to\nbecome her lover's mistress; marriage is the only way to secure her. So\nArmand Peltzer plots to murder the husband. For this purpose he calls in\nthe help of a brother, a ne'er-do-well, who has left his native country\nunder a cloud. He sends for this dubious person to Europe, and there\nbetween them they plan the murder of the inconvenient husband. Though\nthe idea of the crime comes from the one brother, the other receives the\nidea without repugnance and enters wholeheartedly into the commission of\nthe murder. The ascendency of the one is evident, but he knows his\nman, is sure that he will have no difficulty in securing the other's\nco-operation in his felonious purpose. Armand Peltzer should have lived\nin the Italy of the Renaissance.\n\nThe crime was cunningly devised, and methodically and successfully\naccomplished. Only an over-anxiety to secure the fruits of it led to its\ndetection. Barre and Lebiez are a perfect criminal couple, both young\nmen of good education, trained to better things, but the one idle,\ngreedy and vicious, the other cynical, indifferent, inclined at best to\na lazy sentimentalism. Barre is a needy stockbroker at the end of his\ntether, desperate to find an expedient for raising the wind, Lebiez\na medical student who writes morbid verses to a skull and lectures on\nDarwinism. To Barre belongs the original suggestion to murder an old\nwoman who sells milk and is reputed to have savings. But his friend\nand former schoolfellow, Lebiez, accepts the suggestion placidly, and\nreconciles himself to the murder of an unnecessary old woman by the\nsame argument as that used by Raskolnikoff in \"Crime and Punishment\" to\njustify the killing of his victim.\n\nIn all the cases here quoted the couples are essentially criminal\ncouples. From whichever of the two comes the first suggestion of crime,\nit falls on soil already prepared to receive it; the response to the\nsuggestion is immediate. In degree of guilt there is little or nothing\nto choose between them. But the more interesting instances of dual crime\nare those in which one innocent hitherto of crime, to whom it is morally\nrepugnant, is persuaded by another to the commission of a criminal act,\nas Cassius persuades Brutus; Iago, Othello. Cassius is a criminal\nby instinct. Placed in a social position which removes him from the\ntemptation to ordinary crime, circumstances combine in his case to bring\nout the criminal tendency and give it free play in the projected murder\nof Caesar. Sour, envious, unscrupulous, the suggestion to kill Caesar\nunder the guise of the public weal is in reality a gratification\nto Cassius of his own ignoble instincts, and the deliberate\nunscrupulousness with which he seeks to corrupt the honourable metal,\nseduce the noble mind of his friend, is typical of the man's innate\ndishonesty. Cassius belongs to that particular type of the envious\nnature which Shakespeare is fond of exemplifying with more or less\ndegree of villainy in such characters as Iago, Edmund, and Don John,\nof which Robert Butler, whose career is given in this book, is a living\ninstance. Cassius on public grounds tempts Brutus to crime as subtly as\non private grounds Iago tempts Othello, and with something of the same\nmalicious satisfaction; the soliloquy of Cassius at the end of the\nsecond scene of the first act is that of a bad man and a false friend.\nIndeed, the quarrel between Brutus and Cassius after the murder of\nCaesar loses much of its sincerity and pathos unless we can forget for\nthe moment the real character of Cassius. But the interest in the cases\nof Cassius and Brutus, Iago and Othello, lies not so much in the\nnature of the prompter of the crime. The instances in which an honest,\nhonourable man is by force of another's suggestion converted into a\ncriminal are psychologically remarkable. It is to be expected that we\nshould look in the annals of real crime for confirmation of the truth to\nlife of stories such as these, told in fiction or drama.\n\nThe strongest influence, under which the naturally non-criminal person\nmay be tempted in violation of instinct and better nature to the\ncommission of a crime, is that of love or passion. Examples of this kind\nare frequent in the annals of crime. There is none more striking than\nthat of the Widow Gras and Natalis Gaudry. Here a man, brave, honest, of\nhitherto irreproachable character, is tempted by a woman to commit the\nmost cruel and infamous of crimes. At first he repels the suggestion;\nat last, when his senses have been excited, his passion inflamed by the\ncunning of the woman, as the jealous passion of Othello is played on and\nexcited by Iago, the patriotism of Brutus artfully exploited by Cassius,\nhe yields to the repeated solicitation and does a deed in every way\nrepugnant to his normal character. Nothing seems so blinding in its\neffect on the moral sense as passion. It obscures all sense of humour,\nproportion, congruity; the murder of the man or woman who stands in\nthe way of its full enjoyment becomes an act of inverted justice to\nthe perpetrators; they reconcile themselves to it by the most perverse\nreasoning until they come to regard it as an act, in which they may\njustifiably invoke the help of God; eroticism and religion are often\njumbled up together in this strange medley of conflicting emotions.\n\nA woman, urging her lover to the murder of her husband, writes of the\nroses that are to deck the path of the lovers as soon as the crime is\naccomplished; she sends him flowers and in the same letter asks if he\nhas got the necessary cartridges. Her husband has been ill; she hopes\nthat it is God helping them to the desired end; she burns a candle\non the altar of a saint for the success of their murderous plan.(4) A\njealous husband setting out to kill his wife carries in his pockets,\nbeside a knife and a service revolver, a rosary, a medal of the Virgin\nand a holy image.(5) Marie Boyer in the blindness of her passion and\njealousy believes God to be helping her to get rid of her mother.\n\n\n     (4) Case of Garnier and the woman Aveline, 1884.\n\n     (5) Case of the Comte\nde Cornulier: \"Un An de Justice,\" Henri Varennes, 1901.\n\n\nA lover persuades the wife to get rid of her husband. For a whole year\nhe instils the poison into her soul until she can struggle no longer\nagainst the obsession; he offers to do the deed, but she writes that she\nwould rather suffer all the risks and consequences herself. \"How many\ntimes,\" she writes, \"have I wished to go away, leave home, but it meant\nleaving my children, losing them for ever.. that made my lover jealous,\nhe believed that I could not bring myself to leave my husband. But if my\nhusband were out of the way then I would keep my children, and my\nlover would see in my crime a striking proof of my devotion.\" A curious\nfarrago of slavish passion, motherly love and murder.(6)\n\n\n     (6) Case of Madame Weiss and the engineer Roques. If I may be permitted\nthe reference, there is an account of this case and that of Barre and\nLebiez in my book \"French Criminals of the Nineteenth Century.\"\n\n\nThere are some women such as Marie Boyer and Gabrielle Fenayrou, who may\nbe described as passively criminal, chameleon-like, taking colour from\ntheir surroundings. By the force of a man's influence they commit a\ndreadful crime, in the one instance it is matricide, in the other the\nmurder of a former lover, but neither of the women is profoundly vicious\nor criminal in her instincts. In prison they become exemplary, their\ncrime a thing of the past.\n\nGabrielle Fenayrou during her imprisonment, having won the confidence\nof the religious sisters in charge of the convicts, is appointed head\nof one of the workshops. Marie Boyer is so contrite, exemplary in her\nbehaviour that she is released after fifteen years' imprisonment. In\nsome ways, perhaps, these malleable types of women, \"soft paste\" as one\nauthority has described them, \"effacees\" in the words of another, are\nthe most dangerous material of all for the commission of crime, their\nobedience is so complete, so cold and relentless.\n\nThere are cases into which no element of passion enters, in which one\nwill stronger than the other can so influence, so dominate the weaker as\nto persuade the individual against his or her better inclination to an\nact of crime, just as in the relations of ordinary life we see a man\nor woman led and controlled for good or ill by one stronger than\nthemselves. There is no more extraordinary instance of this than the\ncase of Catherine Hayes, immortalised by Thackeray, which occurred\nas long ago as the year 1726. This singular woman by her artful\ninsinuations, by representing her husband as an atheist and a murderer,\npersuaded a young man of the name of Wood, of hitherto exemplary\ncharacter, to assist her in murdering him. It was unquestionably the\nsinister influence of Captain Cranstoun that later in the same century\npersuaded the respectable Miss Mary Blandy to the murder of her father.\nThe assassin of an old woman in Paris recounts thus the arguments used\nby his mistress to induce him to commit the crime: \"She began by telling\nme about the money and jewellery in the old woman's possession which\ncould no longer be of any use to her\"--the argument of Raskolnikoff--\"I\nresisted, but next day she began again, pointing out that one killed\npeople in war, which was not considered a crime, and therefore one\nshould not be afraid to kill a miserable old woman. I urged that the old\nwoman had done us no harm, and that I did not see why one should kill\nher; she reproached me for my weakness and said that, had she been\nstrong enough, she would soon have done this abominable deed herself.\n'God,' she added, 'will forgive us because He knows how poor we are.'\"\nWhen he came to do the murder, this determined woman plied her lover\nwith brandy and put rouge on his cheeks lest his pallor should betray\nhim.(7)\n\n\n     (7) Case of Albert and the woman Lavoitte, Paris, 1877.\n\n\nThere are occasions when those feelings of compunction which troubled\nMacbeth and his wife are wellnigh proof against the utmost powers of\nsuggestion, or, as in the case of Hubert and Prince Arthur, compel the\ncriminal to desist from his enterprise.\n\nA man desires to get rid of his father and mother-in-law. By means of\nthreats, reproaches and inducements he persuades another man to commit\nthe crime. Taking a gun, the latter sets out to do the deed; but he\nrealises the heinousness of it and turns back. \"The next day,\" he says,\n\"at four o'clock in the morning I started again. I passed the village\nchurch. At the sight of the place where I had celebrated my first\ncommunion I was filled with remorse. I knelt down and prayed to God to\nmake me good. But some unknown force urged me to the crime. I started\nagain--ten times I turned back, but the more I hesitated the stronger\nwas the desire to go on.\" At length the faltering assassin arrived at\nthe house, and in his painful anxiety of mind shot a servant instead of\nthe intended victims.(8)\n\n\n     (8) Case of Porcher and Hardouin cited in Despine. \"Psychologie\nNaturelle.\"\n\n\nIn a town in Austria there dwelt a happy and contented married couple,\npoor and hard-working. A charming young lady, a rich relation and an\norphan, comes to live with them. She brings to their modest home wealth\nand comfort. But as time goes on, it is likely that the young lady will\nfall in love and marry. What then? Her hosts will have to return\nto their original poverty. The idea of how to secure to himself the\nadvantages of his young kinswoman's fortune takes possession of the\nhusband's mind. He revolves all manner of means, and gradually murder\npresents itself as the only way. The horrid suggestion fixes itself\nin his mind, and at last he communicates it to his wife. At first she\nresists, then yields to the temptation. The plan is ingenious. The wife\nis to disappear to America and be given out as dead. The husband will\nthen marry his attractive kinswoman, persuade her to make a will in his\nfavour, poison her and, the fortune secured, rejoin his wife. As if\nto help this cruel plan, the young lady has developed a sentimental\naffection for her relative. The wife goes to America, the husband\nmarries the young lady. He commences to poison her, but, in the presence\nof her youth, beauty and affection for him, relents, hesitates to commit\na possibly unnecessary crime. He decides to forget and ignore utterly\nhis wife who is waiting patiently in America. A year passes. The\nexpectant wife gets no sign of her husband's existence. She comes back\nto Europe, visits under a false name the town in which her faithless\nhusband and his bride are living, discovers the truth and divulges the\nintended crime to the authorities. A sentence of penal servitude for\nlife rewards this perfidious criminal.(9)\n\n\n     (9) Case of the Scheffer couple at Linz, cited by Sighele.\n\n\nDerues said to a man who was looking at a picture in the Palais de\nJustice: \"Why study copies of Nature when you can look at such a\nremarkable original as I?\" A judge once told the present writer that he\ndid not go often to the theatre because none of the dramas which he saw\non the stage, seemed to him equal in intensity to those of real life\nwhich came before him in the course of his duties. The saying that truth\nis stranger than fiction applies more forcibly to crime than to\nanything else. But the ordinary man and woman prefer to take their crime\nromanticised, as it is administered to them in novel or play. The true\nstories told in this book represent the raw material from which works\nof art have been and may be yet created. The murder of Mr. Arden of\nFaversham inspired an Elizabethan tragedy attributed by some critics\nto Shakespeare. The Peltzer trial helped to inspire Paul Bourget's\nremarkable novel, \"Andre Cornelis.\" To Italian crime we owe Shelley's\n\"Cenci\" and Browning's \"The Ring and the Book.\" Mrs. Manning was the\noriginal of the maid Hortense in \"Bleak House.\" Jonathan Wild, Eugene\nAram, Deacon Brodie, Thomas Griffiths Wainewright have all been made\nthe heroes of books or plays of varying merit. But it is not only in its\nstories that crime has served to inspire romance. In the investigation\nof crime, especially on the broader lines of Continental procedure, we\ncan track to the source the springs of conduct and character, and come\nnear to solving as far as is humanly possible the mystery of human\nmotive. There is always and must be in every crime a terra incognita\nwhich, unless we could enter into the very soul of a man, we cannot hope\nto reach. Thus far may we go, no farther. It is rarely indeed that a man\nlays bare his whole soul, and even when he does we can never be quite\nsure that he is telling us all the truth, that he is not keeping back\nsome vital secret. It is no doubt better so, and that it should be left\nto the writer of imagination to picture for us a man's inmost soul. The\nstudy of crime will help him to that end. It will help us also in the\nethical appreciation of good and evil in individual conduct, about which\nour notions have been somewhat obscured by too narrow a definition\nof what constitutes crime. These themes, touched on but lightly and\nimperfectly in these pages, are rich in human interest.\n\nAnd so it is hardly a matter for surprise that the poet and the\nphilosopher sat up late one night talking about murders.\n\n\n\n\nThe Life of Charles Peace\n\n\n\"Charles Peace, or the Adventures of a Notorious Burglar,\" a large\nvolume published at the time of his death, gives a full and accurate\naccount of the career of Peace side by side with a story of the Family\nHerald type, of which he is made the hero. \"The Life and Trial of\nCharles Peace\" (Sheffield, 1879), \"The Romantic Career of a Great\nCriminal\" (by N. Kynaston Gaskell, London 1906), and \"The Master\nCriminal,\" published recently in London give useful information. I have\nalso consulted some of the newspapers of the time. There is a delightful\nsketch of Peace in Mr. Charles Whibley's \"Book of Scoundrels.\"\n\nI\n\nHIS EARLY YEARS\n\nCharles Peace told a clergyman who had an interview with him in prison\nshortly before his execution that he hoped that, after he was gone, he\nwould be entirely forgotten by everybody and his name never mentioned\nagain.\n\nPosterity, in calling over its muster-roll of famous men, has refused\nto fulfil this pious hope, and Charley Peace stands out as the one\ngreat personality among English criminals of the nineteenth century. In\nCharley Peace alone is revived that good-humoured popularity which\nin the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries fell to the lot of Claude\nDuval, Dick Turpin and Jack Sheppard. But Peace has one grievance\nagainst posterity; he has endured one humiliation which these heroes\nhave been spared. His name has been omitted from the pages of the\n\"Dictionary of National Biography.\" From Duval, in the seventeenth,\ndown to the Mannings, Palmer, Arthur Orton, Morgan and Kelly, the\nbushrangers, in the nineteenth century, many a criminal, far less\nnotable or individual than Charley Peace, finds his or her place in that\ngreat record of the past achievements of our countrymen. Room has\nbeen denied to perhaps the greatest and most naturally gifted criminal\nEngland has produced, one whose character is all the more remarkable for\nits modesty, its entire freedom from that vanity and vaingloriousness\nso common among his class.\n\nThe only possible reason that can be suggested for so singular an\nomission is the fact that in the strict order of alphabetical succession\nthe biography of Charles Peace would have followed immediately on that\nof George Peabody. It may have been thought that the contrast was too\nglaring, that even the exigencies of national biography had no right\nto make the philanthropist Peabody rub shoulders with man's constant\nenemy, Peace. To the memory of Peace these few pages can make but\npoor amends for the supreme injustice, but, by giving a particular and\nauthentic account of his career, they may serve as material for\nthe correction of this grave omission should remorse overtake those\nresponsible for so undeserved a slur on one of the most unruly of\nEngland's famous sons.\n\nFrom the literary point of view Peace was unfortunate even in the hour\nof his notoriety. In the very year of his trial and execution, the\nAnnual Register, seized with a fit of respectability from which it\nhas never recovered, announced that \"the appetite for the strange and\nmarvellous\" having considerably abated since the year 1757 when the\nRegister was first published, its \"Chronicle,\" hitherto a rich mine of\nextraordinary and sensational occurrences, would become henceforth a\nmere diary of important events. Simultaneously with the curtailment\nof its \"Chronicle,\" it ceased to give those excellent summaries of\ncelebrated trials which for many years had been a feature of its\nvolumes. The question whether \"the appetite for the strange and\nmarvellous\" has abated in an appreciable degree with the passing of time\nand is not perhaps keener than it ever was, is a debatable one. But\nit is undeniable that the present volumes of the Annual Register have\nfallen away dismally from the variety and human interest of their\npredecessors. Of the trial and execution of Peace the volume for 1879\ngives but the barest record.\n\nCharles Peace was not born of criminal parents. His father, John\nPeace, began work as a collier at Burton-on-Trent. Losing his leg in an\naccident, he joined Wombwell's wild beast show and soon acquired some\nreputation for his remarkable powers as a tamer of wild animals. About\nthis time Peace married at Rotherham the daughter of a surgeon in\nthe Navy. On the death of a favourite son to whom he had imparted\nsuccessfully the secrets of his wonderful control over wild beasts of\nevery kind, Mr. Peace gave up lion-taming and settled in Sheffield as a\nshoemaker.\n\nIt was at Sheffield, in the county of Yorkshire, already famous in the\nannals of crime as the county of John Nevison and Eugene Aram, that\nPeace first saw the light. On May 14, 1832, there was born to John Peace\nin Sheffield a son, Charles, the youngest of his family of four. When he\ngrew to boyhood Charles was sent to two schools near Sheffield, where\nhe soon made himself remarkable, not as a scholar, but for his singular\naptitude in a variety of other employments such as making paper models,\ntaming cats, constructing a peep-show, and throwing up a heavy ball of\nshot which he would catch in a leather socket fixed on to his forehead.\n\nThe course of many famous men's lives has been changed by what appeared\nat the time to be an unhappy accident. Who knows what may have been the\neffect on Charles Peace's subsequent career of an accident he met with\nin 1846 at some rolling mills, in which he was employed? A piece of red\nhot steel entered his leg just below the knee, and after eighteen months\nspent in the Sheffield Infirmary he left it a cripple for life. About\nthis time Peace's father died. Peace and his family were fond of\ncommemorating events of this kind in suitable verse; the death of John\nPeace was celebrated in the following lines:\n\n     \"In peace he lived;\n         In peace he died;\n     Life was our desire,\n         But God denied.\"\n\n\nOf the circumstances that first led Peace to the commission of crime we\nknow nothing. How far enforced idleness, bad companionship, according to\nsome accounts the influence of a criminally disposed mother, how far\nhis own daring and adventurous temper provoked him to robbery, cannot\nbe determined accurately. His first exploit was the stealing of an old\ngentleman's gold watch, but he soon passed to greater things. On October\n26, 1851, the house of a lady living in Sheffield was broken into and a\nquantity of her property stolen. Some of it was found in the possession\nof Peace, and he was arrested. Owing no doubt to a good character for\nhonesty given him by his late employer Peace was let off lightly with a\nmonth's imprisonment.\n\nAfter his release Peace would seem to have devoted himself for a time to\nmusic, for which he had always a genuine passion. He taught himself to\nplay tunes on a violin with one string, and at entertainments which he\nattended was described as \"the modern Paganini.\" In later life when he\nhad attained to wealth and prosperity the violin and the harmonium were\na constant source of solace during long winter evenings in Greenwich and\nPeckham. But playing a one-stringed violin at fairs and public-houses\ncould not be more than a relaxation to a man of Peace's active temper,\nwho had once tasted what many of those who have practised it, describe\nas the fascination of that particular form of nocturnal adventure known\nby the unsympathetic name of burglary. Among the exponents of the art\nPeace was at this time known as a \"portico-thief,\" that is to say one\nwho contrived to get himself on to the portico of a house and from that\npoint of vantage make his entrance into the premises. During the\nyear 1854 the houses of a number of well-to-do residents in and about\nSheffield were entered after this fashion, and much valuable property\nstolen. Peace was arrested, and with him a girl with whom he was keeping\ncompany, and his sister, Mary Ann, at that time Mrs. Neil. On October\n20, 1854, Peace was sentenced at Doncaster Sessions to four years' penal\nservitude, and the ladies who had been found in possession of the\nstolen property to six months apiece. Mrs. Neil did not long survive her\nmisfortune. She would seem to have been married to a brutal and drunken\nhusband, whom Peace thrashed on more than one occasion for ill-treating\nhis sister. After one of these punishments Neil set a bulldog on to\nPeace; but Peace caught the dog by the lower jaw and punched it into a\nstate of coma. The death in 1859 of the unhappy Mrs. Neil was lamented\nin appropriate verse, probably the work of her brother:\n\n     \"I was so long with pain opprest\n         That wore my strength away;\n     It made me long for endless rest\n         Which never can decay.\"\n\n\nOn coming out of prison in 1858, Peace resumed his fiddling, but it was\nnow no more than a musical accompaniment to burglary. This had become\nthe serious business of Peace's life, to be pursued, should necessity\narise, even to the peril of men's lives. His operations extended beyond\nthe bounds of his native town. The house of a lady living in Manchester\nwas broken into on the night of August 11, 1859, and a substantial booty\ncarried away. This was found the following day concealed in a hole in\na field. The police left it undisturbed and awaited the return of\nthe robber. When Peace and another man arrived to carry it away, the\nofficers sprang out on them. Peace, after nearly killing the officer\nwho was trying to arrest him, would have made his escape, had not other\npolicemen come to the rescue. For this crime Peace was sentenced to six\nyears' penal servitude, in spite of a loyal act of perjury on the part\nof his aged mother, who came all the way from Sheffield to swear that he\nhad been with her there on the night of the crime.\n\nHe was released from prison again in 1864, and returned to Sheffield.\nThings did not prosper with him there, and he went back to Manchester.\nIn 1866 he was caught in the act of burglary at a house in Lower\nBroughton. He admitted that at the time he was fuddled with whisky;\notherwise his capture would have been more difficult and dangerous.\nUsually a temperate man, Peace realised on this occasion the value\nof sobriety even in burglary, and never after allowed intemperance to\ninterfere with his success. A sentence of eight years' penal servitude\nat Manchester Assizes on December 3, 1866, emphasised this wholesome\nlesson.\n\nWhilst serving this sentence Peace emulated Jack Sheppard in a daring\nattempt to escape from Wakefield prison. Being engaged on some repairs,\nhe smuggled a small ladder into his cell. With the help of a saw made\nout of some tin, he cut a hole through the ceiling of the cell, and was\nabout to get out on to the roof when a warder came in. As the latter\nattempted to seize the ladder Peace knocked him down, ran along the\nwall of the prison, fell off on the inside owing to the looseness of the\nbricks, slipped into the governor's house where he changed his clothes,\nand there, for an hour and a half, waited for an opportunity to escape.\nThis was denied him, and he was recaptured in the governor's bedroom.\nThe prisons at Millbank, Chatham and Gibraltar were all visited by Peace\nbefore his final release in 1872. At Chatham he is said to have taken\npart in a mutiny and been flogged for his pains.\n\nOn his liberation from prison Peace rejoined his family in Sheffield.\nHe was now a husband and father. In 1859 he had taken to wife a widow\nof the name of Hannah Ward. Mrs. Ward was already the mother of a\nson, Willie. Shortly after her marriage with Peace she gave birth to a\ndaughter, and during his fourth term of imprisonment presented him with\na son. Peace never saw this child, who died before his release. But,\ntrue to the family custom, on his return from prison the untimely death\nof little \"John Charles\" was commemorated by the printing of a funeral\ncard in his honour, bearing the following sanguine verses:\n\n     \"Farewell, my dear son, by us all beloved,\n     Thou art gone to dwell in the mansions above.\n     In the bosom of Jesus Who sits on the throne\n     Thou art anxiously waiting to welcome us home.\"\n\n\nWhether from a desire not to disappoint little John Charles, for some\nreason or other the next two or three years of Peace's career would seem\nto have been spent in an endeavour to earn an honest living by picture\nframing, a trade in which Peace, with that skill he displayed in\nwhatever he turned his hand to, was remarkably proficient. In Sheffield\nhis children attended the Sunday School. Though he never went to church\nhimself, he was an avowed believer in both God and the devil. As he\nsaid, however, that he feared neither, no great reliance could be placed\non the restraining force of such a belief to a man of Peace's daring\nspirit. There was only too good reason to fear that little John Charles'\nperiod of waiting would be a prolonged one.\n\nIn 1875 Peace moved from Sheffield itself to the suburb of Darnall. Here\nPeace made the acquaintance--a fatal acquaintance, as it turned out--of\na Mr. and Mrs. Dyson. Dyson was a civil engineer. He had spent some\nyears in America, where, in 1866, he married.\n\nToward the end of 1873 or the beginning of 1874, he came to England with\nhis wife, and obtained a post on the North Eastern Railway. He was a\ntall man, over six feet in height, extremely thin, and gentlemanly in\nhis bearing. His engagement with the North Eastern Railway terminated\nabruptly owing to Dyson's failing to appear at a station to which he had\nbeen sent on duty.\n\nIt was believed at the time by those associated with Dyson that this\nunlooked-for dereliction of duty had its cause in domestic trouble.\nSince the year 1875, the year in which Peace came to Darnall, the\ndomestic peace of Mr. Dyson had been rudely disturbed by this same ugly\nlittle picture-framer who lived a few doors away from the Dysons'\nhouse. Peace had got to know the Dysons, first as a tradesman, then as\na friend. To what degree of intimacy he attained with Mrs. Dyson it is\ndifficult to determine. In that lies the mystery of the case Mrs. Dyson\nis described as an attractive woman, \"buxom and blooming\"; she was\ndark-haired, and about twenty-five years of age. In an interview with\nthe Vicar of Darnall a few days before his execution, Peace asserted\npositively that Mrs. Dyson had been his mistress. Mrs. Dyson as\nstrenuously denied the fact. There was no question that on one occasion\nPeace and Mrs. Dyson had been photographed together, that he had given\nher a ring, and that he had been in the habit of going to music halls\nand public-houses with Mrs. Dyson, who was a woman of intemperate\nhabits.\n\nPeace had introduced Mrs. Dyson to his wife and daughter, and on one\noccasion was said to have taken her to his mother's house, much to the\nold lady's indignation. If there were not many instances of ugly men who\nhave been notably successful with women, one might doubt the likelihood\nof Mrs. Dyson falling a victim to the charms of Charles Peace. But\nPeace, for all his ugliness, could be wonderfully ingratiating when he\nchose. According to Mrs. Dyson, Peace was a demon, \"beyond the power of\neven a Shakespeare to paint,\" who persecuted her with his attentions,\nand, when he found them rejected, devoted all his malignant energies\nto making the lives of her husband and herself unbearable. According to\nPeace's story he was a slighted lover who had been treated by Mrs. Dyson\nwith contumely and ingratitude.\n\nWhether to put a stop to his wife's intimacy with Peace, or to protect\nhimself against the latter's wanton persecution, sometime about the end\nof June, 1876, Dyson threw over into the garden of Peace's house a card,\non which was written: \"Charles Peace is requested not to interfere with\nmy family.\" On July 1 Peace met Mr. Dyson in the street, and tried to\ntrip him up. The same night he came up to Mrs. Dyson, who was talking\nwith some friends, and threatened in coarse and violent language to\nblow out her brains and those of her husband. In consequence of\nthese incidents Mr. Dyson took out a summons against Peace, for whose\napprehension a warrant was issued. To avoid the consequences of this\nlast step Peace left Darnall for Hull, where he opened an eating-shop,\npresided over by Mrs. Peace.\n\nBut he himself was not idle. From Hull he went to Manchester on\nbusiness, and in Manchester he committed his first murder. Entering the\ngrounds of a gentleman's home at Whalley Range, about midnight on\nAugust 1, he was seen by two policemen. One of them, Constable Cock,\nintercepted him as he was trying to escape.\n\nPeace took out his revolver and warned Cock to stand back. The policeman\ncame on. Peace fired, but deliberately wide of him. Cock, undismayed,\ndrew out his truncheon, and made for the burglar. Peace, desperate,\ndetermined not to be caught, fired again, this time fatally. Cock's\ncomrade heard the shots, but before he could reach the side of the dying\nman, Peace had made off. He returned to Hull, and there learned shortly\nafter, to his intense relief, that two brothers, John and William\nHabron, living near the scene of the murder, had been arrested and\ncharged with the killing of Constable Cock.\n\nIf the Dysons thought that they had seen the last of Peace, they were\nsoon to be convinced to the contrary. Peace had not forgotten his\nfriends at Darnall. By some means or other he was kept informed of all\ntheir doings, and on one occasion was seen by Mrs. Dyson lurking near\nher home. To get away from him the Dysons determined to leave Darnall.\nThey took a house at Banner Cross, another suburb of Sheffield, and\non October 29 moved into their new home. One of the first persons Mrs.\nDyson saw on arriving at Banner Cross was Peace himself. \"You see,\"\nhe said, \"I am here to annoy you, and I'll annoy you wherever you go.\"\nLater, Peace and a friend passed Mr. Dyson in the street. Peace took out\nhis revolver. \"If he offers to come near me,\" said he, \"I will make him\nstand back.\" But Mr. Dyson took no notice of Peace and passed on. He had\nanother month to live.\n\nWhatever the other motives of Peace may have been--unreasoning passion,\nspite, jealousy, or revenge it must not be forgotten that Dyson, by\nprocuring a warrant against Peace, had driven him from his home in\nSheffield. This Peace resented bitterly. According to the statements of\nmany witnesses, he was at this time in a state of constant irritation\nand excitement on the Dyson's account. He struck his daughter because\nshe alluded in a way he did not like to his relations with Mrs. Dyson.\nPeace always believed in corporal chastisement as a means of keeping\norder at home. Pleasant and entertaining as he could be, he was feared.\nIt was very dangerous to incur his resentment. \"Be sure,\" said his wife,\n\"you do nothing to offend our Charley, or you will suffer for it.\" Dyson\nbeyond a doubt had offended \"our Charley.\" But for the moment Peace was\ninterested more immediately in the fate of John and William Habron,\nwho were about to stand their trial for the murder of Constable Cock at\nWhalley Range.\n\nThe trial commenced at the Manchester Assizes before Mr. Justice (now\nLord) Lindley on Monday, November 27. John Habron was acquitted.\n\nThe case against William Habron depended to a great extent on the fact\nthat he, as well as his brother, had been heard to threaten to \"do for\"\nthe murdered man, to shoot the \"little bobby.\" Cock was a zealous young\nofficer of twenty-three years of age, rather too eager perhaps in\nthe discharge of his duty. In July of 1876 he had taken out summonses\nagainst John and William Habron, young fellows who had been several\nyears in the employment of a nurseryman in Whalley Range, for being\ndrunk and disorderly. On July 27 William was fined five shillings,\nand on August 1, the day of Cock's murder, John had been fined half\na sovereign. Between these two dates the Habrons had been heard to\nthreaten to \"do for\" Cock if he were not more careful. Other facts\nrelied upon by the prosecution were that William Habron had inquired\nfrom a gunsmith the price of some cartridges a day or two before the\nmurder; that two cartridge percussion caps had been found in the pocket\nof a waistcoat given to William Habron by his employer, who swore that\nthey could not have been there while it was in his possession; that the\nother constable on duty with Cock stated that a man he had seen lurking\nnear the house about twelve o'clock on the night of the murder appeared\nto be William Habron's age, height and complexion, and resembled him in\ngeneral appearance; and that the boot on Habron's left foot, which was\n\"wet and sludgy\" at the time of his arrest, corresponded in certain\nrespects with the footprints of the murderer. The prisoner did not\nhelp himself by an ineffective attempt to prove an alibi. The Judge was\nclearly not impressed by the strength of the case for the prosecution.\nHe pointed out to the jury that neither the evidence of identification\nnor that of the footprint went very far. As to the latter, what evidence\nwas there to show that it had been made on the night of the murder? If\nit had been made the day before, then the defence had proved that it\ncould not have been Habron's. He called their attention to the facts\nthat Habron bore a good character, that, when arrested on the night of\nthe murder, he was in bed, and that no firearms had been traced to him.\nIn spite, however, of the summing-up the jury convicted William Habron,\nbut recommended him to mercy. The Judge without comment sentenced him to\ndeath. The Manchester Guardian expressed its entire concurrence with the\nverdict of the jury. \"Few persons,\" it wrote, \"will be found to dispute\nthe justice of the conclusions reached.\" However, a few days later\nit opened its columns to a number of letters protesting against the\nunsatisfactory nature of the conviction. On December 6 a meeting of\nsome forty gentlemen was held, at which it was resolved to petition Mr.\nCross, the Home Secretary, to reconsider the sentence. Two days before\nthe day of execution Habron was granted a respite, and later his\nsentence commuted to one of penal servitude for life. And so a tragic\nand irrevocable miscarriage of justice was happily averted.\n\nPeace liked attending trials. The fact that in Habron's case he was the\nreal murderer would seem to have made him the more eager not to miss so\nunique an experience. Accordingly he went from Hull to Manchester,\nand was present in court during the two days that the trial lasted. No\nsooner had he heard the innocent man condemned to death than he left\nManchester for Sheffield--now for all he knew a double murderer.\n\nIt is a question whether, on the night of November 28, Peace met Mrs.\nDyson at an inn in one of the suburbs of Sheffield. In any case, the\nnext morning, Wednesday, the 29th, to his mother's surprise Peace walked\ninto her house. He said that he had come to Sheffield for the fair.\nThe afternoon of that day Peace spent in a public-house at Ecclesall,\nentertaining the customers by playing tunes on a poker suspended from\na piece of strong string, from which he made music by beating it with\na short stick. The musician was rewarded by drinks. It took very little\ndrink to excite Peace. There was dancing, the fun grew fast and furious,\nas the strange musician beat out tune after tune on his fantastic\ninstrument.\n\nAt six o'clock the same evening a thin, grey-haired,\ninsignificant-looking man in an evident state of unusual excitement\ncalled to see the Rev. Mr. Newman, Vicar of Ecclesall, near Banner\nCross. Some five weeks before, this insignificant-looking man had\nvisited Mr. Newman, and made certain statements in regard to the\ncharacter of a Mr. and Mrs. Dyson who had come to live in the parish.\nThe vicar had asked for proof of these statements. These proofs his\nvisitor now produced. They consisted of a number of calling cards and\nphotographs, some of them alleged to be in the handwriting of Mrs.\nDyson, and showing her intimacy with Peace. The man made what purported\nto be a confession to Mr. Newman. Dyson, he said, had become jealous of\nhim, whereupon Peace had suggested to Mrs. Dyson that they should give\nher husband something to be jealous about. Out of this proposal their\nintimacy had sprung. Peace spoke of Mrs. Dyson in terms of forgiveness,\nbut his wrath against Dyson was extreme. He complained bitterly that\nby taking proceedings against him, Dyson had driven him to break up his\nhome and become a fugitive in the land. He should follow the Dysons, he\nsaid, wherever they might go; he believed that they were at that moment\nintending to take further proceedings against him. As he left, Peace\nsaid that he should not go and see the Dysons that night, but would call\non a friend of his, Gregory, who lived next door to them in Banner Cross\nTerrace. It was now about a quarter to seven.\n\nPeace went to Gregory's house, but his friend was not at home. The lure\nof the Dysons was irresistible. A little after eight o'clock Peace was\nwatching the house from a passageway that led up to the backs of the\nhouses on the terrace. He saw Mrs. Dyson come out of the back door,\nand go to an outhouse some few yards distant. He waited. As soon as\nshe opened the door to come out, Mrs. Dyson found herself confronted\nby Peace, holding his revolver in his hand. \"Speak,\" he said, \"or I'll\nfire.\" Mrs. Dyson in terror went back. In the meantime Dyson, hearing\nthe disturbance, came quickly into the yard. Peace made for the passage.\nDyson followed him. Peace fired once, the shot striking the lintel\nof the passage doorway. Dyson undaunted, still pursued. Then Peace,\naccording to his custom, fired a second time, and Dyson fell, shot\nthrough the temple. Mrs. Dyson, who had come into the yard again on\nhearing the first shot, rushed to her husband's side, calling out:\n\"Murder! You villain! You have shot my husband.\" Two hours later Dyson\nwas dead.\n\nAfter firing the second shot Peace had hurried down; the passage into\nthe roadway. He stood there hesitating a moment, until the cries of Mrs.\nDyson warned him of his danger. He crossed the road, climbed a wall,\nand made his way back to Sheffield. There he saw his mother and brother,\ntold them that he had shot Mr. Dyson, and bade them a hasty good-bye.\nHe then walked to Attercliffe Railway Station, and took a ticket for\nBeverley. Something suspicious in the manner of the booking-clerk made\nhim change his place of destination. Instead of going to Beverley that\nnight he got out of the train at Normanton and went on to York. He spent\nthe remainder of the night in the station yard. He took the first train\nin the morning for Beverley, and from there travelled via Collingham\nto Hull. He went straight to the eating-house kept by his wife, and\ndemanded some dinner. He had hardly commenced to eat it when he heard\ntwo detectives come into the front shop and ask his wife if a man called\nCharles Peace was lodging with her. Mrs. Peace said that that was\nher husband's name, but that she had not seen him for two months. The\ndetectives proposed to search the house. Some customers in the shop told\nthem that if they had any business with Mrs. Peace, they ought to go\nround to the side door. The polite susceptibility of these customers\ngave Peace time to slip up to a back room, get out on to an adjoining\nroof, and hide behind a chimney stack, where he remained until the\ndetectives had finished an exhaustive search. So importunate were the\nofficers in Hull that once again during the day Peace had to repeat this\nexperience. For some three weeks, however, he contrived to remain in\nHull. He shaved the grey beard he was wearing at the time of Dyson's\nmurder, dyed his hair, put on a pair of spectacles, and for the first\ntime made use of his singular power of contorting his features in such\na way as to change altogether the character of his face. But the hue and\ncry after him was unremitting. There was a price of L100 on his head,\nand the following description of him was circulated by the police:\n\n\n\"Charles Peace wanted for murder on the night of the 29th inst. He is\nthin and slightly built, from fifty-five to sixty years of age. Five\nfeet four inches or five feet high; grey (nearly white) hair, beard and\nwhiskers. He lacks use of three fingers of left hand, walks with his\nlegs rather wide apart, speaks somewhat peculiarly as though his\ntongue were too large for his mouth, and is a great boaster. He is\na picture-frame maker. He occasionally cleans and repairs clocks and\nwatches and sometimes deals in oleographs, engravings and pictures. He\nhas been in penal servitude for burglary in Manchester. He has lived in\nManchester, Salford, and Liverpool and Hull.\"\n\n\nThis description was altered later and Peace's age given as forty-six.\nAs a matter of fact he was only forty-four at this time, but he looked\nvery much older. Peace had lost one of his fingers. He said that it had\nbeen shot off by a man with whom he had quarrelled, but it was believed\nto be more likely that he had himself shot it off accidentally in\nhandling one of his revolvers. It was to conceal this obvious means of\nidentification that Peace made himself the false arm which he was in the\nhabit of wearing. This was of gutta percha, with a hole down the middle\nof it into which he passed his arm; at the end was a steel plate to\nwhich was fixed a hook; by means of this hook Peace could wield a fork\nand do other dexterous feats.\n\nMarked man as he was, Peace felt it dangerous to stay longer in Hull\nthan he could help. During the closing days of the year 1876 and the\nbeginning of 1877, Peace was perpetually on the move. He left Hull for\nDoncaster, and from there travelled to London. On arriving at King's\nCross he took the underground railway to Paddington, and from there a\ntrain to Bristol. At the beginning of January he left Bristol for Bath,\nand from Bath, in the company of a sergeant of police, travelled by\nway of Didcot to Oxford. The officer had in his custody a young woman\ncharged with stealing L40. Peace and the sergeant discussed the case\nduring the journey. \"He seemed a smart chap,\" said Peace in relating\nthe circumstances, \"but not smart enough to know me.\" From Oxford he\nwent to Birmingham, where he stayed four or five days, then a week in\nDerby, and on January 9th he arrived in Nottingham.\n\nHere Peace found a convenient lodging at the house of one, Mrs. Adamson,\na lady who received stolen goods and on occasion indicated or organised\nsuitable opportunities for acquiring them.\n\nShe lived in a low part of the town known as the Marsh. It was at\nher house that Peace met the woman who was to become his mistress and\nsubsequently betray his identity to the police. Her maiden name was\nSusan Gray.\n\nShe was at this time about thirty-five years of age, described as\n\"taking\" in appearance, of a fair complexion, and rather well educated.\nShe had led a somewhat chequered married life with a gentleman named\nBailey, from whom she continued in receipt of a weekly allowance until\nshe passed under the protection of Peace. Her first meeting with her\nfuture lover took place on the occasion of Peace inviting Mrs. Adamson\nto dispose of a box of cigars for him, which that good woman did at a\ncharge of something like thirty per cent. At first Peace gave himself\nout to Mrs. Bailey as a hawker, but before long he openly acknowledged\nhis real character as an accomplished burglar. With characteristic\ninsistence Peace declared his passion for Mrs. Bailey by threatening\nto shoot her if she did not become his. Anxious friends sent for her to\nsoothe the distracted man. Peace had been drowning care with the help\nof Irish whiskey. He asked \"his pet\" if she were not glad to see him, to\nwhich the lady replied with possible sarcasm: \"Oh, particularly, very,\nI like you so much.\" Next day Peace apologised for his rude behaviour\nof the previous evening, and so melted the heart of Mrs. Bailey that she\nconsented to become his mistress, and from that moment discarding the\nname of Bailey is known to history as Mrs. Thompson.\n\nLife in Nottingham was varied pleasantly by burglaries carried out with\nthe help of information supplied by Mrs. Adamson. In the June of 1877\nPeace was nearly detected in stealing, at the request of that worthy,\nsome blankets, but by flourishing his revolver he contrived to get\naway, and, soon after, returned for a season to Hull. Here this hunted\nmurderer, with L100 reward on his head, took rooms for Mrs. Thompson and\nhimself at the house of a sergeant of police. One day Mrs. Peace, who\nwas still keeping her shop in Hull, received a pencilled note saying, \"I\nam waiting to see you just up Anlaby Road.\" She and her stepson, Willie\nWard, went to the appointed spot, and there to their astonishment stood\nher husband, a distinguished figure in black coat and trousers, top\nhat, velvet waistcoat, with stick, kid gloves, and a pretty little fox\nterrier by his side. Peace told them of his whereabouts in the town, but\ndid not disclose to them the fact that his mistress was there also. To\nthe police sergeant with whom he lodged, Peace described himself as\nan agent. But a number of sensational and successful burglaries at\nthe houses of Town Councillors and other well-to-do citizens of Hull\nrevealed the presence in their midst of no ordinary robber. Peace had\nsome narrow escapes, but with the help of his revolver, and on one\noccasion the pusillanimity of a policeman, he succeeded in getting away\nin safety. The bills offering a reward for his capture were still to\nbe seen in the shop windows of Hull, so after a brief but brilliant\nadventure Peace and Mrs. Thompson returned to Nottingham.\n\nHere, as the result of further successful exploits, Peace found a reward\nof L50 offered for his capture. On one occasion the detectives came\ninto the room where Peace and his mistress were in bed. After politely\nexpressing his surprise at seeing \"Mrs. Bailey\" in such a situation,\none of the officers asked Peace his name. He gave it as John Ward, and\ndescribed himself as a hawker of spectacles. He refused to get up and\ndress in the presence of the detectives who were obliging enough to go\ndownstairs and wait his convenience. Peace seized the opportunity to\nslip out of the house and get away to another part of the town. From\nthere he sent a note to Mrs. Thompson insisting on her joining him.\nHe soon after left Nottingham, paid another brief visit to Hull, but\nfinding that his wife's shop was still frequented by the police, whom he\ndesignated freely as \"a lot of fools,\" determined to quit the North for\ngood and begin life afresh in the ampler and safer field of London.\n\n\nII\n\nPEACE IN LONDON\n\n\nPeace's career in London extended over nearly two years, but they were\nyears of copious achievement. In that comparatively short space of time,\nby the exercise of that art, to his natural gifts for which he had now\nadded the wholesome tonic of experience, Peace passed from a poor and\nobscure lodging in a slum in Lambeth to the state and opulence of a\ncomfortable suburban residence in Peckham. These were the halcyon days\nof Peace's enterprise in life. From No. 25 Stangate Street, Lambeth, the\ndealer in musical instruments, as Peace now described himself, sallied\nforth night after night, and in Camberwell and other parts of South\nLondon reaped the reward of skill and vigilance in entering other\npeople's houses and carrying off their property. Though in the beginning\nthere appeared to be but few musical instruments in Stangate Street to\njustify his reputed business, \"Mr. Thompson,\" as he now called himself,\nexplained that he was not wholly dependent on his business, as Mrs.\nThompson \"had money.\"\n\nSo successful did the business prove that at the Christmas of 1877 Peace\ninvited his daughter and her betrothed to come from Hull and spend\nthe festive season with him. This, in spite of the presence of Mrs.\nThompson, they consented to do. Peace, in a top hat and grey ulster,\nshowed them the sights of London, always inquiring politely of a\npoliceman if he found himself in any difficulty. At the end of the visit\nPeace gave his consent to his daughter's marriage with Mr. Bolsover,\nand before parting gave the young couple some excellent advice. For more\nreasons than one Peace was anxious to unite under the same roof Mrs.\nPeace and Mrs. Thompson. Things still prospering, Peace found himself\nable to remove from Lambeth to Crane Court, Greenwich, and before long\nto take a couple of adjoining houses in Billingsgate Street in the\nsame district. These he furnished in style. In one he lived with Mrs.\nThompson, while Mrs. Peace and her son, Willie, were persuaded after\nsome difficulty to leave Hull and come to London to dwell in the other.\n\nBut Greenwich was not to the taste of Mrs. Thompson. To gratify her\nwish, Peace, some time in May, 1877, removed the whole party to a house,\nNo. 5, East Terrace, Evelina Road, Peckham. He paid thirty pounds a year\nfor it, and obtained permission to build a stable for his pony and trap.\nWhen asked for his references, Peace replied by inviting the agent to\ndine with him at his house in Greenwich, a proceeding that seems to have\nremoved all doubt from the agent's mind as to the desirability of the\ntenant.\n\nThis now famous house in Peckham was of the ordinary type of suburban\nvilla, with basement, ground floor, and one above; there were steps up\nto the front door, and a bow window to the front sitting-room. A garden\nat the back of the house ran down to the Chatham and Dover railway line.\nIt was by an entrance at the back that Peace drove his horse and trap\ninto the stable which he had erected in the garden. Though all living\nin the same house, Mrs. Peace, who passed as Mrs. Ward, and her son,\nWillie, inhabited the basement, while Peace and Mrs. Thompson occupied\nthe best rooms on the ground floor. The house was fitted with Venetian\nblinds. In the drawing-room stood a good walnut suite of furniture; a\nTurkey carpet, gilded mirrors, a piano, an inlaid Spanish guitar, and,\nby the side of an elegant table, the beaded slippers of the good\nmaster of the house completed the elegance of the apartment. Everything\nconfirmed Mr. Thompson's description of himself as a gentleman of\nindependent means with a taste for scientific inventions. In association\nwith a person of the name of Brion, Peace did, as a fact, patent an\ninvention for raising sunken vessels, and it is said that in pursuing\ntheir project, the two men had obtained an interview with Mr. Plimsoll\nat the House of Commons. In any case, the Patent Gazette records the\nfollowing grant:\n\n\n\"2635 Henry Fersey Brion, 22 Philip Road, Peckham Rye, London, S.E., and\nJohn Thompson, 5 East Terrace, Evelina Road, Peckham Rye, London, S.E.,\nfor an invention for raising sunken vessels by the displacement of water\nwithin the vessels by air and gases.\"\n\n\nAt the time of his final capture Peace was engaged on other inventions,\namong them a smoke helmet for firemen, an improved brush for washing\nrailway carriages, and a form of hydraulic tank. To the anxious\npoliceman who, seeing a light in Mr. Thompson's house in the small hours\nof the morning, rang the bell to warn the old gentleman of the possible\npresence of burglars, this business of scientific inventions was\nsufficient explanation.\n\nSocially Mr. Thompson became quite a figure in the neighbourhood. He\nattended regularly the Sunday evening services at the parish church, and\nit must have been a matter of anxious concern to dear Mr. Thompson that\nduring his stay in Peckham the vicarage was broken into by a burglar and\nan unsuccessful attempt made to steal the communion plate which was kept\nthere.\n\nMr. Thompson was generous in giving and punctual in paying. He had his\neccentricities. His love of birds and animals was remarkable. Cats,\ndogs, rabbits, guinea-pigs, canaries, parrots and cockatoos all found\nhospitality under his roof. It was certainly eccentricity in Mr.\nThompson that he should wear different coloured wigs; and that his dark\ncomplexion should suggest the use of walnut juice. His love of music was\nevinced by the number of violins, banjoes, guitars, and other musical\ninstruments that adorned his drawing-room. Tea and music formed the\nstaple of the evening entertainments which Mr. and Mrs. Thompson would\ngive occasionally to friendly neighbours. Not that the pleasures of\nconversation were neglected wholly in favour of art. The host was\na voluble and animated talker, his face and body illustrating\nby appropriate twists and turns the force of his comments. The\nRusso-Turkish war, then raging, was a favourite theme of Mr. Thompson's.\nHe asked, as we are still asking, what Christianity and civilisation\nmean by countenancing the horrors of war. He considered the British\nGovernment in the highest degree guilty in supporting the cruel Turks, a\npeople whose sobriety seemed to him to be their only virtue, against\nthe Christian Russians. He was confident that our Ministers would be\npunished for opposing the only Power which had shown any sympathy with\nsuffering races. About ten o'clock Mr. Thompson, whose health, he said,\ncould not stand late hours, would bid his guests good night, and by\nhalf-past ten the front door of No. 5, East Terrace, Evelina Road, would\nbe locked and bolted, and the house plunged in darkness.\n\nNot that it must be supposed that family life at No. 5, East Terrace,\nwas without its jars. These were due chiefly to the drunken habits of\nMrs. Thompson. Peace was willing to overlook his mistress' failing\nas long as it was confined to the house. But Mrs. Thompson had an\nunfortunate habit of slipping out in an intoxicated condition, and\nchattering with the neighbours. As she was the repository of many a\ndangerous secret the inconvenience of her habit was serious. Peace was\nnot the man to hesitate in the face of danger. On these occasions\nMrs. Thompson was followed by Peace or his wife, brought back home and\nsoundly beaten. To Hannah Peace there must have been some satisfaction\nin spying on her successful rival, for, in her own words, Peace never\nrefused his mistress anything; he did not care what she cost him in\ndress; \"she could swim in gold if she liked.\" Mrs. Thompson herself\nadmitted that with the exception of such punishment as she brought on\nherself by her inebriety, Peace was always fond of her, and treated her\nwith great kindness. It was she to whom he would show with pride the\nproceeds of his nightly labours, to whom he would look for a smile when\nhe returned home from his expeditions, haggard and exhausted\n\nThrough all dangers and difficulties the master was busy in the practice\nof his art. Night after night, with few intervals of repose, he would\nsally forth on a plundering adventure. If the job was a distant one, he\nwould take his pony and trap. Peace was devoted to his pony, Tommy,\nand great was his grief when at the end of six months' devotion to duty\nTommy died after a few days' sickness, during which his master attended\nhim with unremitting care. Tommy had been bought in Greenwich for\nfourteen guineas, part of a sum of two hundred and fifty pounds which\nPeace netted from a rich haul of silver and bank-notes taken from a\nhouse in Denmark Hill. Besides the pony and trap, Peace would take with\nhim on these expeditions a violin case containing his tools; at other\ntimes they would be stuffed into odd pockets made for the purpose in\nhis trousers. These tools consisted of ten in all--a skeleton key, two\npick-locks, a centre-bit, gimlet, gouge, chisel, vice jemmy and knife; a\nportable ladder, a revolver and life preserver completed his equipment.\n\nThe range of Peace's activities extended as far as Southampton,\nPortsmouth and Southsea; but the bulk of his work was done in\nBlackheath, Streatham, Denmark Hill, and other suburbs of South London.\nMany dramatic stories are told of his exploits, but they rest for the\nmost part on slender foundation. On one occasion, in getting on to a\nportico, he fell, and was impaled on some railings, fortunately in no\nvital part. His career as a burglar in London lasted from the beginning\nof the year 1877 until October, 1878. During that time this wanted man,\nunder the very noses of the police, exercised with complete success his\nart as a burglar, working alone, depending wholly on his own mental and\nphysical gifts, disposing in absolute secrecy of the proceeds of his\nwork, and living openly the life of a respectable and industrious old\ngentleman.\n\nAll the while the police were busily seeking Charles Peace, the murderer\nof Mr. Dyson. Once or twice they came near to capturing him. On one\noccasion a detective who had known Peace in Yorkshire met him in\nFarringdon Road, and pursued him up the steps of Holborn Viaduct, but\njust as the officer, at the top of the steps, reached out and was on the\npoint of grabbing his man, Peace with lightning agility slipped through\nhis fingers and disappeared. The police never had a shadow of suspicion\nthat Mr. Thompson of Peckham was Charles Peace of Sheffield. They knew\nthe former only as a polite and chatty old gentleman of a scientific\nturn of mind, who drove his own pony and trap, and had a fondness for\nmusic and keeping pet animals.\n\nPeace made the mistake of outstaying his welcome in the neighbourhood\nof South-East London. Perhaps he hardly realised the extent to which\nhis fame was spreading. During the last three months of Peace's career,\nBlackheath was agog at the number of successful burglaries committed\nin the very midst of its peaceful residents. The vigilance of the local\npolice was aroused, the officers on night duty were only too anxious to\neffect the capture of the mysterious criminal.\n\nAbout two o'clock in the morning of October 10, 1878, a police\nconstable, Robinson by name, saw a light appear suddenly in a window at\nthe back of a house in St. John's Park, Blackheath, the residence of a\nMr. Burness. Had the looked-for opportunity arrived? Was the mysterious\nvisitor, the disturber of the peace of Blackheath, at his burglarious\nemployment? Without delay Robinson summoned to his aid two of his\ncolleagues. One of them went round to the front of the house and rang\nthe bell, the other waited in the road outside, while Robinson stayed in\nthe garden at the back. No sooner had the bell rung than Robinson saw a\nman come from the dining-room window which opened on to the garden, and\nmake quickly down the path. Robinson followed him. The man turned; \"Keep\nback!\" he said, \"or by God I'll shoot you!\" Robinson came on. The man\nfired three shots from a revolver, all of which passed close to the\nofficer's head. Robinson made another rush for him, the man fired\nanother shot. It missed its mark. The constable closed with his would-be\nassassin, and struck him in the face. \"I'll settle you this time,\" cried\nthe man, and fired a fifth shot, which went through Robinson's arm just\nabove the elbow. But, in spite of his wound, the valiant officer held\nhis prisoner, succeeded in flinging him to the ground, and catching hold\nof the revolver that hung round the burglar's wrist, hit him on the head\nwith it. Immediately after the other two constables came to the help of\ntheir colleague, and the struggling desperado was secured.\n\nLittle did the police as they searched their battered and moaning\nprisoner realise the importance of their capture. When next morning\nPeace appeared before the magistrate at Greenwich Police Court he was\nnot described by name--he had refused to give any--but as a half-caste\nabout sixty years of age, of repellant aspect. He was remanded for a\nweek. The first clue to the identity of their prisoner was afforded\nby a letter which Peace, unable apparently to endure the loneliness and\nsuspense of prison any longer, wrote to his co-inventor Mr. Brion. It is\ndated November 2, and is signed \"John Ward.\" Peace was disturbed at the\nabsence of all news from his family. Immediately after his arrest, the\nhome in Peckham had been broken up. Mrs. Thompson and Mrs. Peace, taking\nwith them some large boxes, had gone first to the house of a sister of\nMrs. Thompson's in Nottingham, and a day or two later Mrs. Peace had\nleft Nottingham for Sheffield. There she went to a house in Hazel Road,\noccupied by her son-in-law Bolsover, a working collier.(10)\n\n\n     (10) Later, Mrs. Peace was arrested and charged with being in possession\nof stolen property. She was taken to London and tried at the Old Bailey\nbefore Mr. Commissioner Kerr, but acquitted on the ground of her having\nacted under the compulsion of her husband.\n\n\nIt was no doubt to get news of his family that Peace wrote to Brion. But\nthe letters are sufficiently ingenious. Peace represents himself as a\ntruly penitent sinner who has got himself into a most unfortunate and\nunexpected \"mess\" by giving way to drink. The spelling of the letters is\nexaggeratedly illiterate. He asks Mr. Brion to take pity on him and not\ndespise him as \"his own famery has don,\" to write him a letter to \"hease\nhis trobel hart,\" if possible to come and see him. Mr. Brion complied\nwith the request of the mysterious \"John Ward,\" and on arriving at\nNewgate where Peace was awaiting trial, found himself in the presence of\nhis friend and colleague, Mr. Thompson.\n\nIn the meantime the police were getting hot on the scent of the identity\nof \"John Ward\" with the great criminal who in spite of all their efforts\nhad eluded them for two years. The honour and profit of putting the\npolice on the right scent were claimed by Mrs. Thompson. To her Peace\nhad contrived to get a letter conveyed about the same time that he wrote\nto Mr. Brion. It is addressed to his \"dearly beloved wife.\" He asks\npardon for the \"drunken madness\" that has involved him in his present\ntrouble, and gives her the names of certain witnesses whom he would wish\nto be called to prove his independent means and his dealings in musical\ninstruments. It is, he writes, his first offence, and as he has \"never\nbeen in prison before,\" begs her not to feel it a disgrace to come and\nsee him there. But Peace was leaning on a broken reed. Loyalty does not\nappear to have been Susan Thompson's strong point. In her own words she\n\"was not of the sentimental sort.\" The \"traitress Sue,\" as she is called\nby chroniclers of the time, had fallen a victim to the wiles of the\npolice. Since, after Peace's arrest, she had been in possession of a\ncertain amount of stolen property, it was easier no doubt to persuade\nher to be frank.\n\nIn any case, we find that on February 5, 1879, the day after Peace had\nbeen sentenced to death for the murder of Dyson, Mrs. Thompson appealed\nto the Treasury for the reward of L100 offered for Peace's conviction.\nShe based her application on information which she said she had supplied\nto the police officers in charge of the case on November 5 in the\nprevious year, the very day on which Peace had first written to her from\nNewgate. In reply to her letter the Treasury referred \"Mrs. S. Bailey,\nalias Thompson,\" to the Home Office, but whether she received from that\noffice the price of blood history does not relate.\n\nThe police scouted the idea that any revelation of hers had assisted\nthem to identify \"John Ward\" with Charles Peace. They said that it\nwas information given them in Peckham, no doubt by Mr. Brion, who, on\nlearning the deplorable character of his coadjutor, had placed himself\nunreservedly in their hands, which first set them on the track. From\nPeckham they went to Nottingham, where they no doubt came across Sue\nThompson, and thence to Sheffield, where on November 6 they visited\nthe house in Hazel Road, occupied by Mrs. Peace and her daughter, Mrs.\nBolsover. There they found two of the boxes which Mrs. Peace had brought\nwith her from Peckham. Besides stolen property, these boxes contained\nevidence of the identity of Ward with Peace. A constable who had known\nPeace well in Sheffield was sent to Newgate, and taken into the yard\nwhere the prisoners awaiting trial were exercising. As they passed\nround, the constable pointed to the fifth man: \"That's Peace,\" he said,\n\"I'd know him anywhere.\" The man left the ranks and, coming up to the\nconstable, asked earnestly, \"What do you want me for?\" but the Governor\nordered him to go on with his walk.\n\nIt was as John Ward, alias Charles Peace, that Peace, on November 19,\n1878, was put on his trial for burglary and the attempted murder of\nPolice Constable Robinson, at the Old Bailey before Mr. Justice Hawkins.\nHis age was given in the calendar as sixty, though Peace was actually\nforty-six. The evidence against the prisoner was clear enough. All Mr.\nMontagu Williams could urge in his defence was that Peace had never\nintended to kill the officer, merely to frighten him. The jury found\nPeace guilty of attempted murder. Asked if he had anything to say why\njudgment should not be passed upon him, he addressed the Judge. He\nprotested that he had not been fairly dealt with, that he never intended\nto kill the prosecutor, that the pistol was one that went off very\neasily, and that the last shot had been fired by accident. \"I really did\nnot know,\" he said, \"that the pistol was loaded, and I hope, my lord,\nthat you will have mercy on me. I feel that I have disgraced myself, I\nam not fit either to live or die. I am not prepared to meet my God, but\nstill I feel that my career has been made to appear much worse than it\nreally is. Oh, my lord, do have mercy on me; do give me one chance of\nrepenting and of preparing to meet my God. Do, my lord, have mercy on\nme; and I assure you that you shall never repent it. As you hope for\nmercy yourself at the hands of the great God, do have mercy on me, and\ngive me a chance of redeeming my character and preparing myself to meet\nmy God. I pray, and beseech you to have mercy upon me.\"\n\nPeace's assumption of pitiable senility, sustained throughout the trial,\nthough it imposed on Sir Henry Hawkins, failed to melt his heart. He\ntold Peace that he did not believe his statement that he had fired the\npistol merely to frighten the constable; had not Robinson guarded\nhis head with his arm he would have been wounded fatally, and Peace\ncondemned to death. He did not consider it necessary, he said, to make\nan inquiry into Peace's antecedents; he was a desperate burglar, and\nthere was an end of the matter. Notwithstanding his age, Mr. Justice\nHawkins felt it his duty to sentence him to penal servitude for life.\nThe severity of the sentence was undoubtedly a painful surprise\nto Peace; to a man of sixty years of age it would be no doubt less\nterrible, but to a man of forty-six it was crushing.\n\nNot that Peace was fated to serve any great part of his sentence.\n\nWith as little delay as possible he was to be called on to answer to\nthe murder of Arthur Dyson. The buxom widow of the murdered man had been\nfound in America, whither she had returned after her husband's death.\nShe was quite ready to come to England to give evidence against\nher husband's murderer. On January 17, 1879, Peace was taken from\nPentonville prison, where he was serving his sentence, and conveyed by\nan early morning train to Sheffield. There at the Town Hall he appeared\nbefore the stipendiary magistrate, and was charged with the murder of\nArthur Dyson. When he saw Mrs. Dyson enter the witness box and tell her\nstory of the crime, he must have realised that his case was desperate.\nHer cross-examination was adjourned to the next hearing, and Peace was\ntaken back to London. On the 22nd, the day of the second hearing in\nSheffield, an enormous crowd had assembled outside the Town Hall. Inside\nthe court an anxious and expectant audiience{sic}, among them Mrs.\nDyson, in the words of a contemporary reporter, \"stylish and cheerful,\"\nawaited the appearance of the protagonist. Great was the disappointment\nand eager the excitement when the stipendiary came into the court about\na quarter past ten and stated that Peace had attempted to escape that\nmorning on the journey from London to Sheffield, and that in consequence\nof his injuries the case would be adjourned for eight days.\n\nWhat had happened was this. Peace had left King's Cross by the 5.15\ntrain that morning, due to arrive at Sheffield at 8.45. From the very\ncommencement of the journey he had been wilful and troublesome. He kept\nmaking excuses for leaving the carriage whenever the train stopped.\nTo obviate this nuisance the two warders, in whose charge he was, had\nprovided themselves with little bags which Peace could use when he\nwished and then throw out of the window. Just after the train passed\nWorksop, Peace asked for one of the bags. When the window was lowered\nto allow the bag to be thrown away, Peace with lightning agility took a\nflying leap through it. One of the warders caught him by the left foot.\nPeace, hanging from the carriage, grasped the footboard with his hands\nand kept kicking the warder as hard as he could with his right foot.\nThe other warder, unable to get to the window to help his colleague, was\nmaking vain efforts to stop the train by pulling the communication cord.\nFor two miles the train ran on, Peace struggling desperately to escape.\nAt last he succeeded in kicking off his left shoe, and dropped on to the\nline. The train ran on another mile until, with the assistance of some\ngentlemen in other carriages, the warders were able to get it pulled up.\nThey immediately hurried back along the line, and there, near a place\ncalled Kineton Park, they found their prisoner lying in the footway,\napparently unconscious and bleeding from a severe wound in the scalp. A\nslow train from Sheffield stopped to pick up the injured man. As he was\nlifted into the guard's van, he asked them to cover him up as he was\ncold. On arriving at Sheffield, Peace was taken to the Police Station\nand there made as comfortable as possible in one of the cells. Even then\nhe had energy enough to be troublesome over taking the brandy ordered\nfor him by the surgeon, until one of the officers told \"Charley\" they\nwould have none of his hanky-panky, and he had got to take it. \"All\nright,\" said Peace, \"give me a minute,\" after which he swallowed\ncontentedly a couple of gills of the genial spirit.\n\nPeace's daring feat was not, according to his own account, a mere\nattempt to escape from the clutches of the law; it was noble and Roman\nin its purpose. This is what he told his stepson, Willie Ward: \"I saw\nfrom the way I was guarded all the way down from London and all the way\nback, when I came for my first trial, that I could not get away from the\nwarders, and I knew I could not jump from an express train without being\nkilled. I took a look at Darnall as I went down and as I went back, and\nafter I was put in my cell, I thought it all over. I felt that I could\nnot get away, and then I made up my mind to kill myself. I got two bits\nof paper and pricked on them the words, 'Bury me at Darnall. God bless\nyou all!' With a bit of black dirt that I found on the floor of my cell\nI wrote the same words on another piece of paper, and then I hid them in\nmy clothes. My hope was that, when I jumped from the train I should be\ncut to pieces under the wheels. Then I should have been taken to the\nDuke of York (a public-house at Darnall) and there would have been an\ninquest over me. As soon as the inquest was over you would have claimed\nmy body, found the pieces of paper, and then you would have buried me at\nDarnall.\"\n\nThis statement of Peace is no doubt in the main correct. But it is\ndifficult to believe that there was not present to his mind the sporting\nchance that he might not be killed in leaping from the train, in which\nevent he would no doubt have done his best to get away, trusting to his\nconsiderable powers of ingenious disguise to elude pursuit. But such a\nchance was remote. Peace had faced boldly the possibility of a dreadful\ndeath.\n\nWith that strain of domestic sentiment, which would appear to have been\na marked characteristic of his family, Peace was the more ready to\ncheat the gallows in the hope of being by that means buried decently at\nDarnall. It was at Darnall that he had spent some months of comparative\ncalm in his tempestuous career, and it was at Darnall that he had first\nmet Mrs. Dyson. Another and more practical motive that may have urged\nPeace to attempt to injure seriously, if not kill himself, was the\nhope of thereby delaying his trial. If the magisterial investigation\nin Sheffield were completed before the end of January, Peace could be\ncommitted for trial to the ensuing Leeds Assizes which commenced in the\nfirst week in February. If he were injured too seriously, this would not\nbe possible. Here again he was doomed to disappointment.\n\nPeace recovered so well from the results of his adventure on the railway\nthat the doctor pronounced him fit to appear for his second examination\nbefore the magistrate on January 30. To avoid excitement, both on\nthe part of the prisoner and the public, the court sat in one of the\ncorridors of the Town Hall. The scene is described as dismal, dark and\ncheerless. The proceedings took place by candlelight, and Peace, who was\nseated in an armchair, complained frequently of the cold. At other times\nhe moaned and groaned and protested against the injustice with which\nhe was being treated. But the absence of any audience rather dashed the\neffect of his laments.\n\nThe most interesting part of the proceedings was the cross-examination\nof Mrs. Dyson by Mr. Clegg, the prisoner's solicitor.\n\nIts purpose was to show that Mrs. Dyson had been on more intimate terms\nwith Peace than she was ready to admit, and that Dyson had been shot\nby Peace in the course of a struggle, in which the former had been the\naggressor.\n\nIn the first part of his task Mr. Clegg met with some success. Mrs.\nDyson, whose memory was certainly eccentric--she could not, she said,\nremember the year in which she had been married--was obliged to admit\nthat she had been in the habit of going to Peace's house, that she had\nbeen alone with him to public-houses and places of entertainment, and\nthat she and Peace had been photographed together during the summer fair\nat Sheffield. She could not \"to her knowledge\" recollect having told the\nlandlord of a public-house to charge her drink to Peace.\n\nA great deal of Mrs. Dyson's cross-examination turned on a bundle of\nletters that had been found near the scene of Dyson's murder on the\nmorning following the crime. These letters consisted for the most part\nof notes, written in pencil on scraps of paper, purporting to have been\nsent from Mrs. Dyson to Peace. In many of them she asks for money to get\ndrink, others refer to opportunities for their meetings in the absence\nof Dyson; there are kind messages to members of Peace's family, his wife\nand daughter, and urgent directions to Peace to hold his tongue and not\ngive ground for suspicion as to their relations. This bundle of letters\ncontained also the card which Dyson had thrown into Peace's garden\nrequesting him not to interfere with his family. According to the theory\nof the defence, these letters had been written by Mrs. Dyson to Peace,\nand went to prove the intimacy of their relations. At the inquest after\nher husband's murder, Mrs. Dyson had been questioned by the coroner\nabout these letters. She denied that she had ever written to Peace; in\nfact, she said, she \"never did write.\" It was stated that Dyson himself\nhad seen the letters, and declared them to be forgeries written by Peace\nor members of his family for the purpose of annoyance. Nevertheless,\nbefore the Sheffield magistrate Mr. Clegg thought it his duty to\ncross-examine Mrs. Dyson closely as to their authorship. He asked her\nto write out a passage from one of them: \"You can give me something as a\nkeepsake if you like, but I don't like to be covetous, and to take them\nfrom your wife and daughter. Love to all!\" Mrs. Dyson refused to admit\nany likeness between what she had written and the handwriting of the\nletter in question. Another passage ran: \"Will see you as soon as I\npossibly can. I think it would be easier after you move; he won't watch\nso. The r--g fits the little finger. Many thanks and love to--Jennie\n(Peace's daughter Jane). I will tell you what I thought of when I see\nyou about arranging matters. Excuse this scribbling.\" In answer to Mr.\nClegg, Mrs. Dyson admitted that Peace had given her a ring, which she\nhad worn for a short time on her little finger.\n\nAnother letter ran: \"If you have a note for me, send now whilst he is\nout; but you must not venture, for he is watching, and you cannot be too\ncareful. Hope your foot is better. I went to Sheffield yesterday, but\nI could not see you anywhere. Were you out? Love to Jane.\" Mrs. Dyson\ndenied that she had known of an accident which Peace had had to his foot\nat this time. In spite of the ruling of the magistrate that Mr.\nClegg had put forward quite enough, if true, to damage Mrs. Dyson's\ncredibility, he continued to press her as to her authorship of these\nnotes and letters, but Mrs. Dyson was firm in her repudiation of\nthem. She was equally firm in denying that anything in the nature of a\nstruggle had taken place between Peace and her husband previous to his\nmurder.\n\nAt the conclusion of Mrs. Dyson's evidence the prisoner was committed to\ntake his trial at the Leeds Assizes, which commenced the week following.\nPeace, who had groaned and moaned and constantly interrupted the\nproceedings, protested his innocence, and complained that his witnesses\nhad not been called. The apprehension with which this daring malefactor\nwas regarded by the authorities is shown by this clandestine hearing\nof his case in a cold corridor of the Town Hall, and the rapidity with\nwhich his trial followed on his committal. There is an appearance almost\nof precipitation in the haste with which Peace was bustled to his doom.\nAfter his committal he was taken to Wakefield Prison, and a few days\nlater to Armley Jail, there to await his trial.\n\nThis began on February 4, and lasted one day. Mr. Justice Lopes, who had\ntried vainly to persuade the Manchester Grand Jury to throw out the\nbill in the case of the brothers Habron, was the presiding judge. Mr.\nCampbell Foster, Q.C., led for the prosecution. Peace was defended by\nMr. Frank Lockwood, then rising into that popular success at the bar\nwhich some fifteen years later made him Solicitor-General, and but for\nhis premature death would have raised him to even higher honours in his\nprofession.\n\nIn addressing the jury, both Mr. Campbell Foster and Mr. Lockwood took\noccasion to protest against the recklessness with which the press of\nthe day, both high and low, had circulated stories and rumours about\nthe interesting convict. As early as November in 1878 one leading London\ndaily newspaper had said that \"it was now established beyond doubt that\nthe burglar captured by Police Constable Robinson was one and the same\nas the Banner Cross murderer.\" Since then, as the public excitement grew\nand the facts of Peace's extraordinary career came to light, the press\nhad responded loyally to the demands of the greedy lovers of sensation,\nand piled fiction on fact with generous profusion. \"Never,\" said Mr.\nLockwood, \"in the whole course of his experience--and he defied any\nof his learned friends to quote an experience--had there been such an\nattempt made on the part of those who should be most careful of all\nothers to preserve the liberties of their fellowmen and to preserve the\ndignity of the tribunals of justice to determine the guilt of a man.\"\nPeace exclaimed \"Hear, hear!\" as Mr. Lockwood went on to say that \"for\nthe sake of snatching paltry pence from the public, these persons had\nwickedly sought to prejudice the prisoner's life.\" Allowing for Mr.\nLockwood's zeal as an advocate, there can be no question that, had\nPeace chosen or been in a position to take proceedings, more than one\nnewspaper had at this time laid itself open to prosecution for contempt\nof Court. The Times was not far wrong in saying that, since Muller\nmurdered Mr. Briggs on the North London Railway and the poisonings of\nWilliam Palmer, no criminal case had created such excitement as that of\nCharles Peace. The fact that property seemed to be no more sacred to him\nthan life aggravated in a singular degree the resentment of a commercial\npeople.\n\nThe first witness called by the prosecution was Mrs. Dyson. She\ndescribed how on the night of November 29, 1876, she had come out of\nthe outhouse in the yard at the back of her house, and found herself\nconfronted by Peace holding a revolver; how he said: \"Speak, or I'll\nfire!\" and the sequence of events already related up to the moment when\nDyson fell, shot in the temple.\n\nMr. Lockwood commenced his cross-examination of Mrs. Dyson by\nendeavouring to get from her an admission; the most important to the\ndefence, that Dyson had caught hold of Peace after the first shot had\nbeen fired, and that in the struggle which ensued, the revolver had gone\noff by accident. But he was not very successful. He put it to Mrs. Dyson\nthat before the magistrate at Sheffield she had said: \"I can't say\nmy husband did not get hold of the prisoner.\" \"Put in the little\nword 'try,' please,\" answered Mrs. Dyson. In spite of Mr. Lockwood's\nquestions, she maintained that, though her husband may have attempted to\nget hold of Peace, he did not succeed in doing so. As she was the only\nwitness to the shooting there was no one to contradict her statement.\n\nMr. Lockwood fared better when he came to deal with the relations of\nMrs. Dyson with Peace previous to the crime. Mrs. Dyson admitted that\nin the spring of 1876 her husband had objected to her friendship with\nPeace, and that nevertheless, in the following summer, she and Peace\nhad been photographed together at the Sheffield fair. She made a vain\nattempt to escape from such an admission by trying to shift the occasion\nof the summer fair to the previous year, 1875, but Mr. Lockwood put\nit to her that she had not come to Darnall, where she first met Peace,\nuntil the end of that year. Finally he drove her to say that she could\nnot remember when she came to Darnall, whether in 1873, 1874, 1875, or\n1876. She admitted that she had accepted a ring from Peace, but could\nnot remember whether she had shown it to her husband. She had been\nperhaps twice with Peace to the Marquis of Waterford public-house, and\nonce to the Star Music Hall. She could not swear one way or the other\nwhether she had charged to Peace's account drink consumed by her at an\ninn in Darnall called the Half-way House. Confronted with a little girl\nand a man, whom Mr. Lockwood suggested she had employed to carry notes\nto Peace, Mrs. Dyson said that these were merely receipts for pictures\nwhich he had framed for her. On the day before her husband's murder,\nMrs. Dyson was at the Stag Hotel at Sharrow with a little boy belonging\nto a neighbour. A man followed her in and sat beside her, and afterwards\nfollowed her out. In answer to Mr. Lockwood, Mrs. Dyson would \"almost\nswear\" the man was not Peace; he had spoken to her, but she could not\nremember whether she had spoken to him or not. She denied that this man\nhad said to her that he would come and see her the next night. As\nthe result of a parting shot Mr. Lockwood obtained from Mrs. Dyson a\nreluctant admission that she had been \"slightly inebriated\" at the\nHalf-way House in Darnall, but had not to her knowledge been turned\nout of the house on that account. \"You may not have known you were\ninebriated?\" suggested Mr. Lockwood. \"I always know what I am doing,\"\nwas Mrs. Dyson's reply, to which an unfriendly critic might have replied\nthat she did not apparently know with anything like certainty what she\nhad been doing during the last three or four years. In commenting on\nthe trial the following day, the Times stigmatised as \"feeble\" the\nprevarications by which Mrs. Dyson tried to explain away her intimacy\nwith Peace. In this part of his cross-examination Mr. Lockwood had made\nit appear at least highly probable that there had been a much closer\nrelationship between Mrs. Dyson and Peace than the former was willing to\nacknowledge.\n\nThe evidence of Mrs. Dyson was followed by that of five persons who had\neither seen Peace in the neighbourhood of Banner Cross Terrace on the\nnight of the murder, or heard the screams and shots that accompanied it.\nA woman, Mrs. Gregory, whose house was between that of the Dysons and\nthe passage in which Dyson was shot, said that she had heard the noise\nof the clogs Mrs. Dyson was wearing as she went across the yard. A\nminute later she heard a scream. She opened her back door and saw Dyson\nstanding by his own. She told him to go to his wife. She then went back\ninto her house, and almost directly after heard two shots, followed by\nanother scream, but no sound as of any scuffling.\n\nAnother witness was a labourer named Brassington. He was a stranger to\nPeace, but stated that about eight o'clock on the night of the murder\na man came up to him outside the Banner Cross Hotel, a few yards from\nDyson's house. He was standing under a gas lamp, and it was a bright\nmoonlight night. The man asked him if he knew of any strange people who\nhad come to live in the neighbourhood. Brassington answered that he\ndid not. The man then produced a bundle of letters which he asked\nBrassington to read. But Brassington declined, as reading was not one of\nhis accomplishments. The man then said that \"he would make it a warm 'un\nfor those strange folks before morning--he would shoot both of them,\"\nand went off in the direction of Dyson's house. Brassington swore\npositively that Peace was the stranger who had accosted him that night,\nand Mr. Lockwood failed to shake him in his evidence. Nor could Mr.\nLockwood persuade the surgeon who was called to Dyson at the time of his\ndeath to admit that the marks on the nose and chin of the dead man\ncould have been caused by a blow; they were merely abrasions of the skin\ncaused by the wounded man falling to the ground.\n\nEvidence was then given as to threats uttered by Peace against the\nDysons in the July of 1876, and as to his arrest at Blackheath in the\nOctober of 1878. The revolver taken from Peace that night was produced,\nand it was shown that the rifling of the bullet extracted from Dyson's\nhead was the same as that of the bullet fired from the revolver carried\nby Peace at the time of his capture.\n\nMr. Campbell Foster wanted to put in as evidence the card that Dyson\nhad flung into Peace's garden at Darnall requesting him not to interfere\nwith his family. This card had been found among the bundle of letters\ndropped by Peace near the scene of the murder. Mr. Lockwood objected to\nthe admission of the card unless all the letters were admitted at the\nsame time. The Judge ruled that both the card and the letters were\ninadmissible, as irrelevant to the issue; Mr. Lockwood had, he said,\nvery properly cross-examined Mrs. Dyson on these letters to test her\ncredibility, but he was bound by her answers and could not contradict\nher by introducing them as evidence in the case.\n\nMr. Lockwood in his address to the jury did his best to persuade them\nthat the death of Dyson was the accidental result of a struggle between\nPeace and himself. He suggested that Mrs. Dyson had left her house that\nnight for the purpose of meeting Peace, and that Dyson, who was jealous\nof his wife's intimacy with him, had gone out to find her; that Dyson,\nseeing Peace, had caught hold of him; and that the revolver had gone\noff accidentally as Dyson tried to wrest it from his adversary.\nHe repudiated the suggestion of Mr. Foster that the persons he had\nconfronted with Mrs. Dyson in the course of his cross-examination had\nbeen hired for a paltry sum to come into court and lie.\n\nTwice, both at the beginning and the end of his speech, Mr. Lockwood\nurged as a reason for the jury being tender in taking Peace's life that\nhe was in such a state of wickedness as to be quite unprepared to meet\ndeath. Both times that his counsel put forward this curious plea, Peace\nraised his eyes to heaven and exclaimed \"I am not fit to die.\"\n\nMr. Justice Lopes in summing up described as an \"absolute surmise\" the\ntheory of the accidental discharge of the pistol. He asked the jury to\ntake Peace's revolver in their hands and try the trigger, so as to see\nfor themselves whether it was likely to go off accidentally or not. He\npointed out that the pistol produced might not have been the pistol used\nat Banner Cross; at the same time the bullet fired in November, 1876,\nbore marks such as would have been produced had it been fired from the\npistol taken from Peace at Blackheath in October, 1878. He said that Mr.\nLockwood had been perfectly justified in his attempt to discredit the\nevidence of Mrs. Dyson, but the case did not rest on her evidence alone.\nIn her evidence as to the threats uttered by Peace in July, 1876, Mrs.\nDyson was corroborated by three other witnesses. In the Judge's opinion\nit was clearly proved that no struggle or scuffle had taken place\nbefore the murder. If the defence, he concluded, rested on no solid\nfoundation, then the jury must do their duty to the community at large\nand by the oath they had sworn.\n\nIt was a quarter past seven when the jury retired. Ten minutes later\nthey came back into court with a verdict of guilty. Asked if he had\nanything to say, Peace in a faint voice replied, \"It is no use my\nsaying anything.\" The Judge, declining very properly to aggravate the\nprisoner's feelings by \"a recapitulation of any portion of the details\nof what I fear, I can only call your criminal career,\" passed on him\nsentence of death. Peace accepted his fate with composure.\n\nBefore we proceed to describe the last days of Peace on earth, let us\nfinish with the two women who had succeeded Mrs. Peace in his ardent\naffections.\n\nA few days after Peace's execution Mrs. Dyson left England for America,\nbut before going she left behind her a narrative intended to contradict\nthe imputations which she felt had been made against her moral\ncharacter. An Irishwoman by birth, she said that she had gone to America\nwhen she was fifteen years old.\n\nThere she met and married Dyson, a civil engineer on the Atlantic and\nGreat Western Railway. Theirs was a rough and arduous life. But Mrs.\nDyson was thoroughly happy in driving her husband about in a buggy among\nbears and creeks. She did not know fear and loved danger: \"My husband\nloved me and I loved him, and in his company and in driving him about in\nthis wild kind of fashion I derived much pleasure.\" However, Mr. Dyson's\nhealth broke down, and he was obliged to return to England. It was at\nDarnall that the fatal acquaintance with Peace began. Living next\ndoor but one to the Dysons, Peace took the opportunity of introducing\nhimself, and Mr. Dyson \"being a gentleman,\" took polite notice of his\nadvances. He became a constant visitor at the house. But after a time\nPeace began to show that he was not the gentleman Mr. Dyson was. He\ndisgusted the latter by offering to show him improper pictures and \"the\nsights of the town\" of Sheffield.\n\nThe Dysons tried to shake off the unwelcome acquaintance, but that was\neasier said than done. By this time Peace had set his heart on making\nMrs. Dyson leave her husband. He kept trying to persuade her to go to\nManchester with him, where he would take a cigar or picture shop, to\nwhich Mrs. Dyson, in fine clothes and jewelry, should lend the charm of\nher comely presence. He offered her a sealskin jacket, yards of silk,\na gold watch. She should, he said, live in Manchester like a lady, to\nwhich Mrs. Dyson replied coldly that she had always lived like one and\nshould continue to do so quite independently of him. But Peace would\nlisten to no refusal, however decided its tone. Dyson threw over\nthe card into Peace's garden. This only served to aggravate his\ndetermination to possess himself of the wife. He would listen at\nkeyholes, leer in at the window, and follow Mrs. Dyson wherever she\nwent. When she was photographed at the fair, she found that Peace had\nstood behind her chair and by that means got himself included in the\npicture. At times he had threatened her with a revolver. On one occasion\nwhen he was more insulting than usual, Mrs. Dyson forgot her fear of him\nand gave him a thrashing. Peace threatened \"to make her so that neither\nman nor woman should look at her, and then he would have her all to\nhimself.\" It was with some purpose of this kind, Mrs. Dyson suggested,\nthat Peace stole a photograph of herself out of a locket, intending to\nmake some improper use of it. At last, in desperation, the Dysons moved\nto Banner Cross. From the day of their arrival there until the murder,\nMrs. Dyson never saw Peace. She denied altogether having been in his\ncompany the night before the murder. The letters were \"bare forgeries,\"\nwritten by Peace or members of his family to get her into their power.\n\nAgainst the advice of all her friends Mrs. Dyson had come back from\nAmerica to give evidence against Peace. To the detective who saw her at\nCleveland she said, \"I will go back if I have to walk on my head all the\nway\"; and though she little knew what she would have to go through in\ngiving her evidence, she would do it again under the circumstances. \"My\nopinion is,\" she said, \"that Peace is a perfect demon--not a man. I am\ntold that since he has been sentenced to death he has become a changed\ncharacter. That I don't believe. The place to which the wicked go is not\nbad enough for him. I think its occupants, bad as they might be, are too\ngood to be where he is. No matter where he goes, I am satisfied that\nthere will be hell. Not even a Shakespeare could adequately paint such a\nman as he has been. My lifelong regret will be that I ever knew him.\"\n\nWith these few earnest words Mrs. Dyson quitted the shores of England,\nhardly clearing up the mystery of her actual relations with Peace.\n\nA woman with whom Mrs. Dyson very much resented finding herself\nclassed--inebriety would appear to have been their only common\nweakness--was Mrs. Thompson, the \"traitress Sue.\" In spite of the fact\nthat on February 5 Mrs. Thompson had applied to the Treasury for L100,\nblood money due her for assisting the police in the identification of\nPeace, she was at the same time carrying on a friendly correspondence\nwith her lover and making attempts to see him. Peace had written to her\nbefore his trial hoping she would not forsake him; \"you have been my\nbosom friend, and you have ofttimes said you loved me, that you would\ndie for me.\" He asked her to sell some goods which he had left with\nher in order to raise money for his defence. The traitress replied on\nJanuary 27 that she had already sold everything and shared the proceeds\nwith Mrs. Peace. \"You are doing me great injustice,\" she wrote, \"by\nsaying that I have been out to 'work' with you. Do not die with such a\nbase falsehood on your conscience, for you know I am young and have my\nliving and character to redeem. I pity you and myself to think we should\nhave met.\" After his condemnation Mrs. Thompson made repeated efforts\nto see Peace, coming to Leeds for the purpose. Peace wrote a letter on\nFebruary 9 to his \"poor Sue,\" asking her to come to the prison. But,\npartly at the wish of Peace's relatives and for reasons of their own, a\npermission given Mrs. Thompson by the authorities to visit the convict\nwas suddenly withdrawn, and she never saw him again.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nHIS TRIAL AND EXECUTION\n\n\nIn the lives of those famous men who have perished on the scaffold\ntheir behaviour during the interval between their condemnation and their\nexecution has always been the subject of curiosity and interest.\n\nIt may be said at once that nothing could have been more deeply\nreligious, more sincerely repentant, more Christian to all appearances\nthan Peace's conduct and demeanour in the last weeks of his life. He\nthrew himself into the work of atonement with the same uncompromising\nzeal and energy that he had displayed as a burglar. By his death a truly\nwelcome and effective recruit was lost to the ranks of the contrite\nand converted sinners. However powerless as a controlling force--and he\nadmitted it--his belief in God and the devil may have been in the past,\nthat belief was assured and confident, and in the presence of death\nproclaimed itself with vigour, not in words merely, but in deeds.\n\nIn obedience to the wishes of his family, Peace had refrained from\nseeing Sue Thompson. This was at some sacrifice, for he wished very much\nto see her and to the last, though he knew that she had betrayed him,\nsent her affectionate and forgiving messages. These were transmitted\nto Sue by Mr. Brion. This disingenuous gentleman was a fellow-applicant\nwith Sue to the Treasury for pecuniary recognition of his efforts in\nbringing about the identification of Peace, and furnishing the police\nwith information as to the convict's disposal of his stolen property. In\nhis zeal he had even gone so far as to play the role of an accomplice of\nPeace, and by this means discovered a place in Petticoat Lane where the\nburglar got rid of some of his booty.\n\nAfter Peace's condemnation Mr. Brion visited him in Armley Jail. His\npurpose in doing so was to wring from his co-inventor an admission that\nthe inventions which they had patented together were his work alone.\nPeace denied this, but offered to sell his share for L50. Brion refused\nthe offer, and persisted in his assertion that Peace had got his name\nattached to the patents by undue influence, whatever that might mean.\nPeace, after wrestling with the spirit, gave way. \"Very well, my\nfriend,\" he said, \"let it be as you say. I have not cheated you, Heaven\nknows. But I also know that this infamy of mine has been the cause of\nbringing harm to you, which is the last thing I should have wished to\nhave caused to my friend.\" A deed of gift was drawn up, making over to\nBrion Peace's share in their inventions; this Peace handed to Brion\nas the price of the latter's precious forgiveness and a token of the\nsincerity of his colleague's repentance. Thus, as has often happened\nin this sad world, was disreputable genius exploited once again by\nsmug mediocrity. Mr. Brion, having got all he wanted, left the prison,\nassuring the Governor that Peace's repentance was \"all bunkum,\" and\nadvising, with commendable anxiety for the public good, that the warders\nin the condemned cell should be doubled.\n\nPeace had one act of atonement to discharge more urgent than displaying\nChristian forbearance towards ignoble associates. That was the righting\nof William Habron, who was now serving the third year of his life\nsentence for the murder of Constable Cock at Whalley Range. Peace\nsent for the Governor of the jail a few days before his execution and\nobtained from him the materials necessary for drawing up a plan. Peace\nwas quite an adept at making plans; he had already made an excellent one\nof the scene of Dyson's murder. He now drew a plan of the place where\nCock had been shot, gave a detailed account of how he came by his death,\nand made a full confession of his own guilt.\n\nIn the confession he described how, some days before the burglary, he\nhad, according to his custom, \"spotted\" the house at Whalley Range. In\norder to do this he always dressed himself respectably, because he had\nfound that the police never suspected anyone who wore good clothes. On\nthe night of the crime he passed two policemen on the road to the house.\nHe had gone into the grounds and was about to begin operations when he\nheard a rustle behind him and saw a policeman, whom he recognised as one\nof those he had met in the road, enter the garden. With his well-known\nagility Peace climbed on to the wall, and dropped on to the other side,\nonly to find himself almost in the arms of the second policeman. Peace\nwarned the officer to stand back and fired his revolver wide of him.\nBut, as Peace said, \"these Manchester policemen are a very obstinate\nlot.\" The constable took out his truncheon. Peace fired again and killed\nhim.\n\nSoon after the murderer saw in the newspapers that two men had been\narrested for the crime. \"This greatly interested me,\" said Peace. \"I\nalways had a liking to be present at trials, as the public no doubt know\nby this time.\" So he went to Manchester Assizes and saw William Habron\nsentenced to death. \"People will say,\" he said, \"that I was a hardened\nwretch for allowing an innocent man to suffer for the crime of which\nI was guilty but what man would have given himself up under such\ncircumstances, knowing as I did that I should certainly be hanged?\"\nPeace's view of the question was a purely practical one: \"Now that I\nam going to forfeit my own life and feel that I have nothing to gain\nby further secrecy, I think it is right in the sight of God and man to\nclear this innocent young man.\" It would have been more right in the\nsight of God and man to have done it before, but then Peace admitted\nthat during all his career he had allowed neither God nor man to\ninfluence his actions.\n\nHow many men in the situation of Peace at the time, with the certainty\nof death before him if he confessed, would have sacrificed themselves to\nsave an innocent man? Cold-blooded heroism of this kind is rare in the\nannals of crime. Nor did Peace claim to have anything of the hero about\nhim.\n\n     \"Lion-hearted I've lived,\n     And when my time comes\n     Lion-hearted I'll die.\"\n\nThough fond of repeating this piece of doggerel, Peace would have\nbeen the last man to have attributed to himself all those qualities\nassociated symbolically with the lion.\n\nA few days before his execution Peace was visited in his prison by Mr.\nLittlewood, the Vicar of Darnall. Mr. Littlewood had known Peace a few\nyears before, when he had been chaplain at Wakefield Prison. \"Well, my\nold friend Peace,\" he said as he entered the cell, \"how are you to-day?\"\n\"'I am very poorly, sir,\" replied the convict, \"but I am exceedingly\npleased to see you.\" Mr. Littlewood assured Peace that there was at any\nrate one person in the world who had deep sympathy with him, and that\nwas himself. Peace burst into tears. He expressed a wish to unburden\nhimself to the vicar, but before doing so, asked for his assurance that\nhe believed in the truth and sincerity of what he was about to say to\nhim. He said that he preferred to be hanged to lingering out his life\nin penal servitude, that he was grieved and repentant for his past\nlife. \"If I could undo, or make amends for anything I have done, I would\nsuffer my body as I now stand to be cut in pieces inch by inch. I feel,\nsir, that I am too bad to live or die, and having this feeling I cannot\nthink that either you or anyone else would believe me, and that is the\nreason why I ask you so much to try to be assured that you do not think\nI am telling lies. I call my God to witness that all I am saying and\nwish to say shall be the truth--the whole truth--nothing but the truth.\"\nMr. Littlewood said that, after carefully watching Peace and having\nregard to his experience of some of the most hardened of criminals\nduring his service in Wakefield Prison, he felt convinced that Peace\nwas in earnest and as sincere as any man could be; he spoke rationally,\ncoherently, and without excitement.\n\nPeace was determined to test the extent of the reverend gentleman's\nfaith in his asseverations. \"Now, sir,\" he said, \"I understand that you\nstill have the impression that I stole the clock from your day-schools.\"\nMr. Littlewood admitted that such was his impression. \"I thought so,\"\nreplied Peace, \"and this has caused me much grief and pain, for I can\nassure you I have so much respect for you personally that I would rather\nhave given you a clock and much more besides than have taken it. At the\ntime your clock was stolen I had reason for suspecting that it was taken\nby some colliers whom I knew.\" There was a pause. Mr. Littlewood thought\nthat Peace was going to give him the name of the colliers. But that was\nnot Peace's way. He said sharply: \"Do you now believe that I have spoken\nthe truth in denying that I took your clock, and will you leave me\nto-day fully believing that I am innocent of doing that?\" Mr. Littlewood\nlooked at him closely and appeared to be deliberating on his reply.\nPeace watched him intently. At last Mr. Littlewood said, \"Peace, I am\nconvinced that you did not take the clock. I cannot believe that you\ndare deny it now in your position, if you really did.\" Once more Peace\nburst into tears, and was unable for some time to speak.\n\nHaving recovered his self-possession, Peace turned to the serious\nbusiness of confession. He dealt first with the murder of Dyson.\n\nHe maintained that his relations with Mrs. Dyson had been of an intimate\ncharacter. He wanted to see her on the night of the crime in order\nto get her to induce her husband to withdraw the warrant which he had\nprocured against him; he was tired, he said, of being hunted about\nfrom place to place. He intercepted Mrs. Dyson as she crossed the\nyard. Instead of listening to him quietly Mrs. Dyson became violent and\nthreatening in her language. Peace took out his revolver, and, holding\nit close to her head, warned her that he was not to be trifled with. She\nrefused to be warned. Dyson, hearing the loud voices, came out of his\nhouse. Peace tried to get away down the passage into Banner Cross Road,\nbut Dyson followed and caught hold of him. In the struggle Peace fired\none barrel of his revolver wide. Dyson seized the hand in which Peace\nwas holding the weapon. \"Then I knew,\" said Peace, \"I had not a moment\nto spare. I made a desperate effort, wrenched the arm from him and fired\nagain. All that was in my head at the time was to get away. I never did\nintend, either there or anywhere else, to take a man's life; but I was\ndetermined that I should not be caught at that time, as the result,\nknowing what I had done before, would have been worse even than had I\nstayed under the warrant.\" If he had intended to murder Dyson, Peace\npointed out that he would have set about it in quite a different and\nmore secret way; it was as unintentional a thing as ever was done; Mrs.\nDyson had committed the grossest perjury in saying that no struggle had\ntaken place between her husband and himself.\n\nIt is to be remembered that Peace and Mrs. Dyson were the sole\nwitnesses of what took place that night between the two men. In point\nof credibility there may be little to choose between them, but Peace can\nclaim for his account that it was the statement of a dying, and, to all\nappearances, sincerely repentant sinner.\n\nPeace then repeated to Mr. Littlewood his confession of the killing of\nConstable Cock, and his desire that Habron should be set free.(11) As to\nthis part of his career Peace indulged in some general reflections.\n\"My great mistake, sir,\" he said, \"and I can see it now as my end\napproaches, has been this--in all my career I have used ball cartridge.\nI can see now that in using ball cartridge I did wrong I ought to have\nused blank cartridge; then I would not have taken life.\" Peace said that\nhe hoped he would meet his death like a hero. \"I do not say this in\nany kind of bravado. I do not mean such a hero as some persons will\nunderstand when they read this. I mean such a hero as my God might wish\nme to be. I am deeply grieved for all I have done, and would atone\nfor it to the utmost of my power.\" To Mr. Littlewood the moment seemed\nconvenient to suggest that as a practical means of atonement Peace\nshould reveal to him the names of the persons with whom he had disposed\nof the greater part of his stolen property. But in spite of much\nattempted persuasion by the reverend gentleman Peace explained that he\nwas a man and meant to be a man to the end.\n\n\n     (11) William Habron was subsequently given a free pardon and L800 by way\nof compensation.\n\n\nEarlier in their interview Peace had expressed to Mr. Littlewood a hope\nthat after his execution his name would never be mentioned again, but\nbefore they parted he asked Mr. Littlewood, as a favour, to preach a\nsermon on him after his death to the good people of Darnall. He wished\nhis career held up to them as a beacon, in order that all who saw might\navoid his example, and so his death be of some service to society.\n\nBefore Mr. Littlewood left, Peace asked him to hear him pray. Having\nrequested the warders to kneel down, Peace began a prayer that lasted\ntwenty minutes. He prayed for himself, his family, his victims, Mr.\nLittlewood, society generally, and all classes of the community. Mr.\nLittlewood described the prayer as earnest, fervent and fluent. At the\nend Peace asked Mr. Littlewood if he ought to see Mrs. Dyson and beg\nher forgiveness for having killed her husband. Mr. Littlewood, believing\nerroneously that Mrs. Dyson had already left the country, told Peace\nthat he should direct all his attention to asking forgiveness of his\nMaker. At the close of their interview Peace was lifted into bed and,\nturning his face to the wall, wept.\n\nTuesday, February 25, was the day fixed for the execution of Peace.\nAs the time drew near, the convict's confidence in ultimate salvation\nincreased. A Dr. Potter of Sheffield had declared in a sermon that \"all\nhope of Peace's salvation was gone for ever.\" Peace replied curtly,\n\"Well, Dr. Potter may think so, but I don't.\" Though his health had\nimproved, Peace was still very feeble in body. But his soul was hopeful\nand undismayed. On the Saturday before his death his brother and\nsister-in-law, a nephew and niece visited him for the last time. He\nspoke with some emotion of his approaching end. He said he should die\nabout eight o'clock, and that at four o'clock an inquest would be held\non his body; he would then be thrown into his grave without service\nor sermon of any kind. He asked his relatives to plant a flower on a\ncertain grave in a cemetery in Sheffield on the day of his execution. He\nwas very weak, he said, but hoped he should have strength enough to\nwalk to the scaffold. He sent messages to friends and warnings to avoid\ngambling and drinking. He begged his brother to change his manner of\nlife and \"become religious.\" His good counsel was not apparently\nvery well received. Peace's visitors took a depressing view of their\nrelative's condition. They found him \"a poor, wretched, haggard man,\"\nand, meeting Mrs. Thompson who was waiting outside the gaol for news of\n\"dear Jack,\" wondered how she could have taken up with such a man.\n\nWhen, the day before his execution, Peace was visited for the last time\nby his wife, his stepson, his daughter, Mrs. Bolsover, and her husband,\nhe was in much better spirits. He asked his visitors to restrain\nthemselves from displays of emotion, as he felt very happy and did\nnot wish to be disturbed. He advised them to sell or exhibit for money\ncertain works of art of his own devising. Among them was a design\nin paper for a monument to be placed over his grave. The design is\nelaborate but well and ingeniously executed; in the opinion of Frith,\nthe painter, it showed \"the true feeling of an artist.\" It is somewhat\nin the style of the Albert Memorial, and figures of angels are prominent\nin the scheme. The whole conception is typical of the artist's sanguine\nand confident assurance of his ultimate destiny. A model boat and a\nfiddle made out of a hollow bamboo cane he wished also to be made the\nmeans of raising money. He was describing with some detail the ceremony\nof his approaching death and burial when he was interrupted by a sound\nof hammering. Peace listened for a moment and then said, \"That's a noise\nthat would make some men fall on the floor. They are working at my own\nscaffold.\" A warder said that he was mistaken. \"No, I am not,\" answered\nPeace, \"I have not worked so long with wood without knowing the sound of\ndeals; and they don't have deals inside a prison for anything else than\nscaffolds.\" But the noise, he said, did not disturb him in the least, as\nhe was quite prepared to meet his fate. He would like to have seen his\ngrave and coffin; he knew that his body would be treated with scant\nceremony after his death. But what of that? By that time his soul would\nbe in Heaven. He was pleased that one sinner who had seen him on his way\nfrom Pentonville to Sheffield, had written to tell him that the sight of\nthe convict had brought home to him the sins of his own past life, and\nby this means he had found salvation.\n\nThe time had come to say good-bye for the last time. Peace asked his\nweeping relatives whether they had anything more that they wished to ask\nhim. Mrs. Peace reminded him that he had promised to pray with them\nat the last. Peace, ever ready, knelt with them and prayed for half an\nhour. He then shook hands with them, prayed for and blessed each one\nsingly, and himself gave way to tears as they left his presence. To his\nwife as she departed Peace gave a funeral card of his own designing. It\nran:\n\n     In\n     Memory\n     of\n     Charles Peace\n     Who was executed in\n     Armley Prison\n     Tuesday February 25th,\n     1879 Aged 47\n\n     For that I don but never\n     Intended.\n\n\nThe same day there arrived in the prison one who in his own trade had\nsomething of the personality and assurance of the culprit he was to\nexecute. William Marwood--unlike his celebrated victim, he has his place\nin the Dictionary of National Biography--is perhaps the most remarkable\nof these persons who have held at different times the office of public\nexecutioner. As the inventor of the \"long drop,\" he has done a lasting\nservice to humanity by enabling the death-sentence passed by the judge\nto be carried out with the minimum of possible suffering. Marwood took a\nlofty view of the office he held, and refused his assent to the somewhat\nhypocritical loathing, with which those who sanction and profit by his\nexertions are pleased to regard this servant of the law. \"I am doing\nGod's work,\" said Marwood, \"according to the divine command and the\nlaw of the British Crown. I do it simply as a matter of duty and as\na Christian. I sleep as soundly as a child and am never disturbed by\nphantoms. Where there is guilt there is bad sleeping, but I am conscious\nthat I try to live a blameless life. Detesting idleness, I pass\nmy vacant time in business (he was a shoemaker at Horncastle, in\nLincolnshire) and work in my shoeshop near the church day after day\nuntil such time as I am required elsewhere. It would have been better\nfor those I executed if they had preferred industry to idleness.\"\n\nMarwood had not the almost patriarchal air of benevolent respectability\nwhich his predecessor Calcraft had acquired during a short experience\nas a family butler; but as an executioner that kindly old gentleman\nhad been a sad bungler in his time compared with the scientific and\nexpeditious Marwood. The Horncastle shoemaker was saving, businesslike,\npious and thoughtful. Like Peace, he had interests outside his ordinary\nprofession. He had at one time propounded a scheme for the abolition of\nthe National Debt, a man clearly determined to benefit his fellowmen in\nsome way or other. A predilection for gin would seem to have been his\nonly concession to the ordinary weakness of humanity. And now he had\narrived in Armley Jail to exercise his happy dispatch on the greatest\nof the many criminals who passed through his hands, one who, in his own\nwords, \"met death with greater firmness\" than any man on whom he had\nofficiated during seven years of Crown employment.\n\nThe day of February the 25th broke bitterly cold. Like Charles I.\nbefore him, Peace feared lest the extreme cold should make him appear\nto tremble on the scaffold. He had slept calmly till six o'clock in the\nmorning. A great part of the two hours before the coming of the hangman\nPeace spent in letter-writing. He wrote two letters to his wife, in one\nof which he copied out some verses he had written in Woking Prison\non the death of their little boy John. In the second he expressed his\nsatisfaction that he was to die now and not linger twenty years in\nprison. To his daughter, step-son and son-in-law he wrote letters of\nfervent, religious exhortation and sent them tracts and pictures\nwhich he had secured from well-intentioned persons anxious about\nhis salvation. To an old friend, George Goodlad, a pianist, who\nhad apparently lived up to his name, he wrote: \"You chose an honest\nindustrious way through life, but I chose the one of dishonesty,\nvillainy and sin\"; let his fate, he said, be a warning.\n\nPeace ate a hearty breakfast and awaited the coming of the executioner\nwith calm. He had been troubled with an inconvenient cough the night\nbefore. \"I wonder,\" he said to one of his warders, \"if Marwood could\ncure this cough of mine.\" He had got an idea into his head that Marwood\nwould \"punish\" him when he came to deal with him on the scaffold, and\nasked to see the hangman a few minutes before the appointed hour. \"I\nhope you will not punish me. I hope you will do your work quickly,\" he\nsaid to Marwood. \"You shall not suffer pain from my hand,\" replied that\nworthy. \"God bless you,\" exclaimed Peace, \"I hope to meet you all in\nheaven. I am thankful to say my sins are all forgiven.\" And so these two\npious men--on the morning of an execution Marwood always knelt down and\nasked God's blessing on the work he had to do--shook hands together and\nset about their business. Firmly and fearlessly Peace submitted himself\nto the necessary preparations. For one moment he faltered as the gallows\ncame in sight, but recovered himself quickly.\n\nAs Marwood was about to cover his face, Peace stopped him with some\nirritation of manner and said that he wished to speak to the gentlemen\nof the press who had been admitted to the ceremony. No one gainsaid him,\nand he thus addressed the reporters: \"You gentlemen reporters, I wish\nyou to notice the few words I am going to say. You know what my life\nhas been. It has been base; but I wish you to notice, for the sake of\nothers, how a man can die, as I am about to die, in fear of the Lord.\nGentlemen, my heart says that I feel assured that my sins are forgiven\nme, that I am going to the Kingdom of Heaven, or else to the place\nprepared for those who rest until the great Judgment day. I do not think\nI have any enemies, but if there are any who would be so, I wish them\nwell. Gentlemen, all and all, I wish them to come to the Kingdom of\nHeaven when they die, as I am going to die.\" He asked a blessing on the\nofficials of the prison and, in conclusion, sent his last wishes and\nrespects to his dear children and their mother. \"I hope,\" he said, \"no\none will disgrace them by taunting them or jeering them on my account,\nbut to have mercy upon them. God bless you, my dear children. Good-bye,\nand Heaven bless you. Amen: Oh, my Lord God, have mercy upon me!\"\n\nAfter the cap had been placed over his head Peace asked twice very\nsharply, as a man who expected to be obeyed, for a drink of water. But\nthis time his request was not compiled with. He died instantaneously and\nwas buried in Armley Jail.\n\nHad Peace flourished in 1914 instead of 1874, his end might have been\nhonourable instead of dishonourable. The war of to-day has no doubt\nsaved many a man from a criminal career by turning to worthy account\nqualities which, dangerous in crime, are useful in war. Absolute\nfearlessness, agility, resource, cunning and determination; all these\nare admirable qualities in the soldier; and all these Charles Peace\npossessed in a signal degree. But fate denied him opportunity, he became\na burglar and died on the scaffold. Years of prison life failed, as they\ndid in those days, to make any impression for good on one resolute in\nwhatever way he chose to go. Peace was a born fighter. A detective who\nknew him and had on one occasion come near capturing him in London, said\nthat he was a fair fighter, that he always gave fair warning to those on\nwhom he fired, and that, being a dead shot, the many wide shots which\nhe fired are to be reckoned proofs of this. Peace maintained to the last\nthat he had never intended to kill Dyson. This statement ex-detective\nParrock believed, and that the fatal shot was fired over Peace's\nshoulder as he was making off. Though habitually sober, Peace was made\nintoxicated now and then by the drink, stood him by those whom he used\nto amuse with his musical tricks and antics in public-houses. At such\ntimes he would get fuddled and quarrelsome. He was in such a frame\nof mind on the evening of Dyson's murder. His visit to the Vicar of\nEcclesall brought him little comfort or consolation. It was in this\nunsatisfactory frame of mind that he went to Dyson's house. This much\nthe ex-detective would urge in his favour. To his neighbours he was an\nawe-inspiring but kind and sympathetic man. \"If you want my true opinion\nof him,\" says Detective Parrock, \"he was a burglar to the backbone but\nnot a murderer at heart. He deserved the fate that came to him as little\nas any who in modern times have met with a like one.\" Those who are in\nthe fighting line are always the most generous about their adversaries.\nParrock as a potential target for Peace's revolver, may have erred on\nthe side of generosity, but there is some truth in what he says.\n\nAs Peace himself admitted, his life had been base. He was well aware\nthat he had misused such gifts as nature had bestowed on him. One\nmust go back to mediaeval times to find the counterpart of this daring\nruffian who, believing in personal God and devil, refuses until the end\nto allow either to interfere with his business in life. In this respect\nCharles Peace reminds us irresistibly of our Angevin kings.\n\nThere is only one criminal who vies with Charley Peace in that genial\npopular regard which makes Charles \"Charley\" and John \"Jack,\" and that\nis Jack Sheppard. What Jack was to the eighteenth century, that Charley\nwas to the nineteenth. And each one is in a sense typical of his period.\nLecky has said that the eighteenth century is richer than any other\nin the romance of crime. I think it may fairly be said that in the\nnineteenth century the romance of crime ceased to be. In the eighteenth\ncentury the scenery and dresses, all the stage setting of crime make for\nromance; its literature is quaint and picturesque; there is something\ngay and debonair about the whole business.\n\nSheppard is typical of all this. There is a certain charm about the\nrascal; his humour is undeniable; he is a philosopher, taking all that\ncomes with easy grace, even his betrayal by his brother and others\nwho should have been loyal to him. Jack Sheppard has the good-humoured\ncarelessness of that most engaging of all eighteenth century\nmalefactors, Deacon Brodie. It is quite otherwise with Charley Peace.\nThere is little enough gay or debonair about him. Compared with\nSheppard, Peace is as drab as the surroundings of mid-Victorian crime\nare drab compared with the picturesqueness of eighteenth century\nEngland.\n\nCrime in the nineteenth century becomes more scientific in its methods\nand in its detection also. The revolver places a more hasty, less\ndecorous weapon than the old-fashioned pistol in the hands of the\ndetermined burglar. The literature of crime, such as it is, becomes\nvulgar and prosaic. Peace has no charm about him, no gaiety, but he has\nthe virtues of his defects. He, unlike Sheppard, shuns company; he works\nalone, never depending on accomplices; a \"tight cock,\" as Sheppard would\nhave phrased it, and not relying on a like quality of tightness in\nhis fellows. Sheppard is a slave to his women, Edgeworth Bess and Mrs.\nMaggot; Mrs. Peace and Sue Thompson are the slaves of Peace. Sheppard\nloves to stroll openly about the London streets in his fine suit\nof black, his ruffled shirt and his silver-hilted sword. Peace lies\nconcealed at Peckham beneath the homely disguise of old Mr. Thompson.\nSheppard is an imp, Peace a goblin. But both have that gift of\npersonality which, in their own peculiar line, lifts them out from the\nruck, and makes them Jack and Charley to those who like to know famous\npeople by cheery nicknames.\n\nAnd so we must accept Charles Peace as a remarkable character, whose\nunquestioned gifts as a man of action were squandered on a criminal\ncareer; neither better nor worse than a great number of other persons,\nwhose good fortune it has been to develop similar qualities under\nhappier surroundings. There are many more complete villains than the\nordinary criminal, who contrive to go through life without offending\nagainst the law. Close and scientific investigation has shown that the\naverage convicted criminal differs intellectually from the normal person\nonly in a slightly lower level of intelligence, a condition that may\nwell be explained by the fact that the convicted criminal has been\nfound out. Crime has been happily defined by a recent and most able\ninvestigator into the character of the criminal(12) as \"an unusual act\ncommitted by a perfectly normal person.\" At the same time, according\nto the same authority, there is a type of normal person who tends to\nbe convicted of crime, and he is differentiated from his fellows by\ndefective physique and mental capacity and an increased possession of\nantisocial qualities.(13)\n\n\n     (12) \"The English Convict,\" a statistical study, by Charles Goring, M.D.\nHis Majesty's Stationery Office, 1913.\n\n     (13) Murderers--at least those executed for their crimes--have not for\nobvious reasons been made the subject of close scientific observation.\nTheir mental capacity would in all probability be found to be rather\nhigher than that of less ambitious criminals.\n\n\nHow does Peace answer to the definition? Though short in stature, his\nphysical development left little to be desired: he was active, agile,\nand enjoyed excellent health at all times. For a man of forty-seven he\nhad aged remarkably in appearance. That is probably to be accounted for\nby mental worry. With two murders on his conscience we know from Sue\nThompson that all she learnt of his secrets was what escaped from him in\nhis troubled dreams--Peace may well have shown traces of mental\nanxiety. But in all other respects Charles Peace would seem to have been\nphysically fit. In intellectual capacity he was undoubtedly above the\naverage of the ordinary criminal. The facts of his career, his natural\ngifts, speak for themselves. Of anti-social proclivities he no doubt\npossessed his share at the beginning, and these were aggravated, as in\nmost cases they were in his day, by prison life and discipline.\n\nJudged as scientifically as is possible where the human being is\nconcerned, Peace stands out physically and intellectually well above\nthe average of his class, perhaps the most naturally gifted of all those\nwho, without advantages of rank or education, have tried their hands at\ncrime. Ordinary crime for the most part would appear to be little better\nthan the last resort of the intellectually defective, and a poor game\nat that. The only interesting criminals are those worthy of something\nbetter. Peace was one of these. If his life may be said to point a\nmoral, it is the very simple one that crime is no career for a man of\nbrains.\n\n\n\n\nThe Career of Robert Butler\n\n\nThere is a report of Butler's trial published in Dunedin. It gives in\nfull the speeches and the cross-examination of the witnesses, but not\nin all cases the evidence-in-chief. By the kindness of a friend in\nNew Zealand I obtained a copy of the depositions taken before the\nmagistrate; with this I have been able to supplement the report of the\ntrial. A collection of newspaper cuttings furnished me with the details\nof the rest of Butler's career.\n\nI\n\nTHE DUNEDIN MURDERS\n\nOn the evening of March 23, 1905, Mr. William Munday, a highly respected\ncitizen of the town of Tooringa, in Queensland, was walking to the\nneighbouring town of Toowong to attend a masonic gathering. It was about\neight o'clock, the moon shining brightly. Nearing Toowong, Mr. Munday\nsaw a middle-aged man, bearded and wearing a white overcoat, step\nout into the moonlight from under the shadow of a tree. As Mr. Munday\nadvanced, the man in the white coat stood directly in his way. \"Out with\nall you have, and quick about it,\" he said. Instead of complying with\nthis peremptory summons, Mr. Munday attempted to close with him. The man\ndrew back quickly, whipped out a revolver, fired, and made off as fast\nas he could. The bullet, after passing through Mr. Munday's left arm,\nhad lodged in the stomach. The unfortunate gentleman was taken to a\nneighbouring hospital where, within a few hours, he was dead.\n\nIn the meantime a vigorous search was made for his assailant. Late the\nsame night Constable Hennessy, riding a bicycle, saw a man in a white\ncoat who seemed to answer to the description of the assassin. He\ndismounted, walked up to him and asked him for a match. The man put his\nhand inside his coat. \"What have you got there?\" asked the constable.\n\"I'll--soon show you,\" replied the man in the white coat, producing\nsuddenly a large revolver. But Hennessy was too quick for him. Landing\nhim one under the jaw, he sent him to the ground and, after a sharp\nstruggle, secured him. Constable Hennessy little knew at the time that\nhis capture in Queensland of the man in the white coat was almost as\nnotable in the annals of crime as the affray at Blackheath on an autumn\nnight in 1878, when Constable Robinson grappled successfully, wounded as\nhe was, with Charles Peace.\n\nThe man taken by Hennessy gave the name of James Wharton, and as\nJames Wharton he was hanged at Brisbane. But before his death it was\nascertained beyond doubt, though he never admitted it himself, that\nWharton was none other than one Robert Butler, whose career as a\ncriminal and natural wickedness may well rank him with Charles Peace in\nthe hierarchy of scoundrels. Like Peace, Butler was, in the jargon of\ncrime, a \"hatter,\" a \"lone hand,\" a solitary who conceived and\nexecuted his nefarious designs alone; like Peace, he supplemented an\ninsignificant physique by a liberal employment of the revolver; like\nPeace, he was something of a musician, the day before his execution he\nplayed hymns for half an hour on the prison organ; like Peace, he knew\nwhen to whine when it suited his purpose; and like Peace, though not\nwith the same intensity, he could be an uncomfortably persistent lover,\nwhen the fit was on him. Both men were cynics in their way and viewed\ntheir fellow-men with a measure of contempt. But here parallel ends.\nButler was an intellectual, inferior as a craftsman to Peace, the\nessentially practical, unread, naturally gifted artist. Butler was a man\nof books. He had been schoolmaster, journalist. He had studied the lives\nof great men, and as a criminal, had devoted especial attention to those\nof Frederick the Great and Napoleon. Butler's defence in the Dunedin\nmurder trial was a feat of skill quite beyond the power of Peace. Peace\nwas a religious man after the fashion of the mediaeval tyrant, Butler\nan infidel. Peace, dragged into the light of a court of justice, cut a\nsorry figure; here Butler shone. Peace escaped a conviction for murder\nby letting another suffer in his place; Butler escaped a similar\nexperience by the sheer ingenuity of his defence. Peace had the modesty\nand reticence of the sincere artist; Butler the loquacious vanity of the\nliterary or forensic coxcomb. Lastly, and it is the supreme difference,\nButler was a murderer by instinct and conviction, as Lacenaire or\nRuloff; \"a man's life,\" he said, \"was of no more importance than a\ndog's; nature respects the one no more than the other, a volcanic\neruption kills mice and men with the one hand. The divine command,\n'kill, kill and spare not,' was intended not only for Joshua, but for\nmen of all time; it is the example of our rulers, our Fredericks and\nNapoleons.\"\n\nButler was of the true Prussian mould. \"In crime,\" he would say, \"as\nin war, no half measures. Let us follow the example of our rulers whose\norders in war run, 'Kill, burn and sink,' and what you cannot carry\naway, destroy.'\" Here is the gospel of frightfulness applied almost\nprophetically to crime. To Butler murder is a principle of warfare; to\nPeace it was never more than a desperate resort or an act the outcome of\nungovernable passion.\n\nIreland can claim the honour of Butler's birth. It took place at\nKilkenny about 1845. At an early age he left his native land for\nAustralia, and commenced his professional career by being sentenced\nunder the name of James Wilson--the same initials as those of James\nWharton of Queensland--to twelve months' imprisonment for vagrancy. Of\nthe sixteen years he passed in Victoria he spent thirteen in prison,\nfirst for stealing, then in steady progression for highway robbery and\nburglary. Side by side with the practical and efficient education in\ncrime furnished by the Victorian prisons of that day, Butler availed\nhimself of the opportunity to educate his mind. It was during this\nperiod that he found inspiration and encouragement in the study of the\nlives of Frederick and Napoleon, besides acquiring a knowledge of music\nand shorthand.\n\nWhen in 1876 Butler quitted Australia for New Zealand, he was\nsufficiently accomplished to obtain employment as a schoolmaster.\n\nAt Cromwell, Otago, under the name of \"C. J. Donelly, Esq.,\" Butler\nopened a \"Commercial and Preparatory Academy,\" and in a prospectus that\nrecalls Mr. Squeers' famous advertisement of Dotheboys Hall, announced\nthat the programme of the Academy would include \"reading, taught as\nan art and upon the most approved principles of elocution, writing,\narithmetic, euclid, algebra, mensuration, trigonometry, book-keeping,\ngeography, grammar, spelling and dictation, composition, logic and\ndebate, French, Latin, shorthand, history, music, and general lectures\non astronomy, natural philosophy, geology, and other subjects.\" The\nsimpler principles of these branches of learning were to be \"rendered\nintelligible, and a firm foundation laid for the acquirement of future\nknowledge.\" Unfortunately a suspicion of theft on Butler's part cut\nshort the fulfilment of this really splendid programme, and Butler left\nCromwell hurriedly for the ampler field of Dunedin. There, less than a\nfortnight after his arrivel{sic}, he was sentenced to four years' hard\nlabour for several burglaries committed in and about that city.\n\nOn the 18th of February, 1880, Butler was released from prison. With\nthat consummate hypocrisy which was part of the man, he had contrived to\nenlist the sympathies of the Governor of the Dunedin Jail, who gave\nhim, on his departure, a suit of clothes and a small sum of money.\nA detective of the name of Bain tried to find him employment. Butler\nwished to adopt a literary career. He acted as a reporter on the Dunedin\nEvening Star, and gave satisfaction to the editor of that newspaper. An\nattempt to do some original work, in the shape of \"Prison Sketches,\"\nfor another newspaper, was less successful. Bain had arranged for the\npublication of the articles in the Sunday Advertiser, but when the time\ncame to deliver his manuscript, Butler failed to appear. Bain, whose\nduty it was to keep an eye on Butler, found him in the street looking\nwild and haggard. He said that he had found the work \"too much for his\nhead,\" that he had torn up what he had written, that he had nowhere to\ngo, and had been to the end of the jetty with the intention of drowning\nhimself. Bain replied somewhat caustically that he thought it a pity he\nhad not done so, as nothing would have given him greater joy than\ngoing to the end of the jetty and identifying his body. \"You speak\nvery plainly,\" said Butler. \"Yes, and what is more, I mean what I say,\"\nreplied Bain. Butler justified Bain's candour by saying that if he broke\nout again, he would be worse than the most savage tiger ever let loose\non the community. As a means of obviating such an outbreak, Butler\nsuggested that, intellectual employment having failed, some form of\nmanual labour should be found him. Bain complied with Butler's request,\nand got him a job at levelling reclaimed ground in the neighbourhood of\nDunedin. On Wednesday, March 10, Butler started work, but after three\nhours of it relinquished the effort. Bain saw Butler again in Dunedin on\nthe evening of Saturday, March 13, and made an appointment to meet him\nat half-past eight that night. Butler did not keep the appointment. Bain\nsearched the town for him, but he was nowhere to be found.\n\nAbout the same time Butler had some talk with another member of the\nDunedin police force, Inspector Mallard. They discussed the crimes of\nCharles Peace and other notable artists of that kind. Butler remarked to\nMallard how easy it would be to destroy all traces of a murder by fire,\nand asked the inspector whether if he woke up one morning to find some\nbrutal murder had been committed, he would not put it down to him. \"No,\nButler,\" replied the inspector, \"the first thing I should do would be to\nlook for suspicious circumstances, and most undoubtedly, if they pointed\nto you, you would be looked after.\"\n\nIn the early morning of this Saturday, March 13, the house of a Mr.\nStamper, a solicitor of Dunedin, had been broken into, and some articles\nof value, among them a pair of opera glasses, stolen. The house had been\nset on fire, and burned to the ground. On the morning of the following\nday, Sunday, the 14th, Dunedin was horrified by the discovery of a far\nmore terrible crime, tigerish certainly in its apparent ferocity. In a\nhouse in Cumberland Street, a young married couple and their little baby\nwere cruelly murdered and un{sic}{an??} unsuccessful attempt made to\nfire the scene of the crime.\n\nAbout half-past six on Sunday morning a man of the name of Robb, a\ncarpenter, on getting out of bed, noticed smoke coming from the house\nof a neighbor of his, Mr. J. M. Dewar, who occupied a small one-floored\ncottage standing by itself in Cumberland Street, a large and broad\nthoroughfare on the outskirts of the town. Dewar was a butcher by trade,\na young man, some eighteen months married, and father of a baby girl.\nRobb, on seeing smoke coming from Dewar's house, woke his son, who was\na member of the fire brigade. The latter got up, crossed the street,\nand going round to the back door, which he found wide open, entered the\nhouse. As he went along the passage that separated the two front rooms,\na bedroom and sitting-room, he called to the inmates to get up. He\nreceived no answer, but as he neared the bedroom he heard a \"gurgling\"\nsound. Crawling on his hands and knees he reached the bedroom door, and\ntwo feet inside it his right hand touched something. It was the body of\na woman; she was still alive, but in a dying condition. Robb dragged\nher across the passage into the sitting-room. He got some water, and\nextinguished the fire in the bedroom. On the bed lay the body of Dewar.\nTo all appearances he had been killed in his sleep. By his side was\nthe body of the baby, suffocated by the smoke. Near the bed was an\naxe belonging to Dewar, stained with blood. It was with this weapon,\napparently, that Mr. and Mrs. Dewar had been attacked. Under the bed was\na candlestick belonging also to the Dewars, which had been used by\nthe murderer in setting fire to the bed. The front window of the\nsitting-room was open, there were marks of boot nails on the sill, and\non the grass in front of the window a knife was found. An attempt\nhad been made to ransack a chest of drawers in the bedroom, but some\narticles of jewellery lying in one of the drawers, and a ring on the\ndressing-table had been left untouched. As far as was known, Mr. and\nMrs. Dewar were a perfectly happy and united couple. Dewar had been last\nseen alive about ten o'clock on the Saturday night getting off a car\nnear his home. At eleven a neighbour had noticed a light in the Dewars'\nhouse. About five o'clock on the Sunday morning another neighbour\nhad been aroused from his sleep by the sound as of something falling\nheavily. It was a wild and boisterous night. Thinking the noise might be\nthe slamming of his stable door, he got up and went out to see that\nit was secure. He then noticed that a light was burning in the bedroom\nwindow of the Dewars' cottage.\n\nNothing more was known of what had occurred that morning until at\nhalf-past six Robb saw the smoke coming from Dewars' house. Mrs. Dewar,\nwho alone could have told something, never recovered consciousness\nand died on the day following the crime. Three considerable wounds\nsufficient to cause death had been inflicted on the unfortunate woman's\nhead, and five of a similar character on that of her husband. At the\nhead of the bed, which stood in the corner of the room, there was a\nlarge smear of blood on the wall just above the door; there were spots\nof blood all over the top of the bed, and some smaller ones that had to\nall appearances spurted on to the panel of the door nearest to the bed.\n\nThe investigation of this shocking crime was placed in the hands of\nDetective Bain, whose duty it had been to keep an eye on Robert Butler,\nbut he did not at first associate his interesting charge with the\ncommission of the murder. About half-past six on Sunday evening Bain\nhappened to go to a place called the Scotia Hotel, where the landlord\ninformed him that one of his servants, a girl named Sarah Gillespie, was\nvery anxious to see him. Her story was this: On the morning of Thursday,\nMarch 11, Robert Butler had come to the hotel; he was wearing a dark\nlavender check suit and carried a top coat and parcel. Butler had stayed\nin the hotel all Thursday and slept there that night. He had not slept\nin the hotel on the Friday night, and Sarah Gillespie had not seen him\nagain until he came into the house about five and twenty minutes to\nseven on Sunday morning. The girl noticed that he was pale and excited,\nseemed afraid and worried, as if someone were coming after him. After\ngiving her some money for the landlord, he went upstairs, fetched his\ntop coat, a muffler, and his parcel. Before leaving he said he would\nhave a pint of beer, as he had not breakfasted. He then left, presumably\nto catch an early train.\n\nButler was next seen a few minutes later at a shop near the hotel, where\nhe bought five tins of salmon, and about the same time a milk-boy saw\nhim standing on the kerb in Cumberland Street in a stooping position,\nhis head turned in the direction of Dewars' house. A little after ten\nthe same night Butler entered a hotel at a place called Blueskin, some\ntwelve miles distant from Dunedin. He was wearing an overcoat and a\nlight muffler. He sat down at a table in the dining-room and seemed\nweary and sleepy. Someone standing at the bar said \"What a shocking\nmurder that was in Cumberland Street!\" Butler started up, looked\nsteadily from one to the other of the two men who happened to be in the\nroom, then sat down again and, taking up a book, appeared to be reading.\nMore than once he put down the book and kept shifting uneasily in his\nchair. After having some supper he got up, paid his reckoning, and left\nthe hotel.\n\nAt half-past three the following morning, about fifteen miles from\nDunedin, on the road to Waikouaiti, two constables met a man whom they\nrecognised as Butler from a description that had been circulated by the\npolice. The constables arrested and searched him. They found on him a\npair of opera glasses, the property of Mr. Stamper, whose house had been\nburgled and burned down on the morning of the 13th. Of this crime Butler\nacknowledged himself to be the perpetrator. Besides the opera glasses\nthe constables took from Butler two tins of salmon, a purse containing\nfour shillings and sixpence, a pocket knife, a box of matches, a piece\nof candle, and a revolver and cartridges. The prisoner was carrying a\ntop coat, and was dressed in a dark coat and grey trousers, underneath\nwhich he was wearing a white shirt, an under flannel and a Rob Roy\nCrimean shirt. One of the constables noticed that there were marks of\nblood on his shirt. Another singular feature in Butler's attire was the\nfact that the outer soles of his boots had been recently removed. When\nlast seen in Dunedin Butler had been wearing a moustache; he was now\nclean shaven.\n\nThe same evening a remarkable interview took place in the lock-up at\nWaikouaiti between Butler and Inspector Mallard. Mallard, who had some\nreason for suspecting Butler, bearing in mind their recent conversation,\ntold the prisoner that he would be charged with the murder in Cumberland\nStreet. For a few seconds, according to Mallard, the prisoner seemed\nterribly agitated and appeared to be choking. Recovering himself\nsomewhat, he said, \"If for that, you can get no evidence against me; and\nif I am hanged for it, I shall be an innocent man, whatever other crimes\nI may have committed.\" Mallard replied, \"There is evidence to convict\nyou--the fire was put out.\" Butler than{sic} said that he would ask\nMallard a question, but, after a pause, decided not to do so. Mallard,\nafter examining Butler's clothes, told him that those were not the\nclothes in which he had left the Scotia Hotel. Butler admitted it, and\nsaid he had thrown those away in the North East Valley. Mallard alluded\nto the disappearance of the prisoner's moustache. Butler replied that he\nhad cut it off on the road. Mallard noticed then the backs of Butler's\nhands were scratched, as if by contact with bushes. Butler seemed often\non the point of asking questions, but would then stop and say \"No, I\nwon't ask you anything.\" To the constables who had arrested him Butler\nremarked, \"You ought to remember me, because I could have shot you if I\nhad wished.\" When Mallard later in the evening visited Butler again, the\nprisoner who was then lying down said, \"I want to speak to you. I want\nto ask the press not to publish my career. Give me fair play. I suppose\nI shall be convicted and you will see I can die like a man.\"\n\nA few days after Butler's arrest a ranger on the Town Belt, a hill\noverlooking Dunedin, found a coat, a hat and silk striped cravat, and\na few days later a pair of trousers folded up and placed under a bush.\nThese articles of clothing were identified as those which Butler\nhad been seen wearing on the Saturday and Sunday morning. They were\nexamined. There were a number of bloodstains on them, not one of them\nlarger in size than a pea, some almost invisible. On the front of the\ntrousers about the level of the groin there were blood spots on both\nsides. There was blood on the fold of the left breast of the coat and on\nthe lining of the cuff of the right arm. The shirt Butler was wearing\nat the time of his arrest was examined also. There were small spots of\nblood, about fourteen altogether, on the neck and shoulder bands, the\nright armpit, the left sleeve, and on both wristbands. Besides the\nclothes, a salmon tin was found on the Town Belt, and behind a seat in\nthe Botanical Gardens, from which a partial view of the Dewars' house\nin Cumberland Street could be obtained, two more salmon tins were found,\nall three similar to the five purchased by Butler on the Sunday morning,\ntwo of which had been in his possession at the time of his arrest.\n\nSuch were the main facts of the case which Butler had to answer when,\na few weeks later, he was put on his trial before the Supreme Court at\nDunedin. The presiding judge was Mr. Justice Williams, afterwards Sir\nJoshua Williams and a member of the Privy Council. The Crown Prosecutor,\nMr. Haggitt, conducted the case for the Crown, and Butler defended\nhimself.\n\n\nII\n\nTHE TRIAL OF BUTLER\n\n\nTo a man of Butler's egregious vanity his trial was a glorious\nopportunity for displaying his intellectual gifts, such as they were.\nOne who had known him in prison about this time describes him as a\nstrange compound of vanity and envy, blind to his own faults and envious\nof the material advantages enjoyed by others. Self-willed and arrogant,\nhe could bully or whine with equal effect. Despising men, he believed\nthat if a man did not possess some requisite quality, he had only to ape\nit, as few would distinguish between the real and the sham.\n\nBut with all these advantages in the struggle for life, it is certain\nthat Butler's defence would have been far less effective had be{sic}\nbeen denied all professional aid. As a matter of fact, throughout his\ntrial Butler was being advised by three distinguished members of the New\nZealand bar, now judges of the Supreme Court, who though not appearing\nfor him in court, gave him the full benefit of their assistance\noutside it. At the same time Butler carried off the thing well. Where\nimagination was required, Butler broke down; he could not write sketches\nof life in prison; that was too much for his pedestrian intellect. But\ngiven the facts of a case, dealing with a transaction of which he alone\nknew the real truth, and aided by the advice and guidance of trained\nintellects, Butler was unquestionably clever and shrewd enough to make\nthe best use of such advantages in meeting the case against him.\n\nThus equipped for the coming struggle, this high-browed ruffian, with\nhis semi-intellectual cast of countenance, his jerky restless posturing,\nhis splay-footed waddle, \"like a lame Muscovy duck,\" in the graphic\nwords of his gaol companion, stood up to plead for his life before the\nSupreme Court at Dunedin.\n\nIt may be said at the outset that Butler profited greatly by the\nscrupulous fairness shown by the Crown Prosecutor. Mr. Haggitt extended\nto the prisoner a degree of consideration and forbearance, justified\nundoubtedly towards an undefended prisoner. But, as we have seen, Butler\nwas not in reality undefended. At every moment of the trial he was in\ncommunication with his legal advisers, and being instructed by them how\nto meet the evidence given against him. Under these circumstances the\nunfailing consideration shown him by the Crown Prosecutor seems almost\nexcessive. From the first moment of the trial Butler was fully alive\nto the necessities of his situation. He refrained from including in his\nchallenges of the jury the gentleman who was afterwards foreman; he knew\nhe was all right, he said, because he parted his hair in the middle, a\n\"softy,\" in fact. He did not know in all probability that one gentleman\non the jury had a rooted conviction that the murder of the Dewars was\nthe work of a criminal lunatic. There was certainly nothing in Butler's\ndemeanour or behaviour to suggest homicidal mania.\n\nThe case against Butler rested on purely circumstantial evidence.\n\nNo new facts of importance were adduced at the trial. The stealing\nof Dewar's wages, which had been paid to him on the Saturday, was the\nmotive for the murder suggested by the Crown. The chief facts pointing\nto Butler's guilt were: his conversation with Mallard and Bain previous\nto the crime; his demeanour after it; his departure from Dunedin; the\nremoval of his moustache and the soles of his boots; his change of\nclothes and the bloodstains found upon them, added to which was\nhis apparent inability to account for his movements on the night in\nquestion.\n\nSuch as the evidence was, Butler did little to shake it in\ncross-examination. His questions were many of them skilful and pointed,\nbut on more than one occasion the judge intervened to save him from the\ndanger common to all amateur cross-examiners, of not knowing when to\nstop. He was most successful in dealing with the medical witnesses.\nButler had explained the bloodstains on his clothes as smears that had\ncome from scratches on his hands, caused by contact with bushes. This\nexplanation the medical gentlemen with good reason rejected. But they\nwent further, and said that these stains might well have been caused by\nthe spurting and spraying of blood on to the murderer as he struck his\nvictims. Butler was able to show by the position of the bloodstains on\nthe clothes that such an explanation was open to considerable doubt.\n\nButler's speech in his defence lasted six hours, and was a creditable\nperformance. Its arrangement is somewhat confused and repetitious, some\npoints are over-elaborated, but on the whole he deals very successfully\nwith most of the evidence given against him and exposes the\nunquestionable weakness of the Crown case. At the outset he declared\nthat he had taken his innocence for his defence. \"I was not willing,\"\nhe said, \"to leave my life in the hands of a stranger. I was willing to\nincur all the disadvantages which the knowledge of the law might bring\nupon me. I was willing, also, to enter on this case without\nany experience whatever of that peculiarly acquired art of\ncross-examination. I fear I have done wrong. If I had had the assistance\nof able counsel, much more light would have been thrown on this case\nthan has been.\" As we have seen, Butler enjoyed throughout his trial the\ninformal assistance of three of the most able counsel in New Zealand, so\nthat this heroic attitude of conscious innocence braving all dangers\nloses most of its force. Without such assistance his danger might have\nbeen very real.\n\nA great deal of the evidence as to his conduct and demeanour at the time\nof the murder Butler met by acknowledging that it was he who had broken\ninto Mr. Stamper's house on the Saturday morning, burgled it and set it\non fire. His consciousness of guilt in this respect was, he said, quite\nsufficient to account for anything strange or furtive in his manner\nat that time. He was already known to the police; meeting Bain on the\nSaturday night, he felt more than ever sure that he was susspected{sic}\nof the robbery at Mr. Stamper's; he therefore decided to leave Dunedin\nas soon as possible. That night, he said, he spent wandering about the\nstreets half drunk, taking occasional shelter from the pouring rain,\nuntil six o'clock on the Sunday morning, when he went to the Scotia\nHotel. A more detailed account of his movements on the night of the\nDewars' murder he did not, or would not, give.\n\nWhen he comes to the facts of the murder and his theories as to the\nnature and motive of the crime--theories which he developed at rather\nunnecessary length for the purpose of his own defence--his speech is\ninteresting. It will be recollected that on the discovery of the murder,\na knife was found on the grass outside the house. This knife was not\nthe property of the Dewars. In Butler's speech he emphasised the opinion\nthat this knife had been brought there by the murderer: \"Horrible though\nit may be, my conclusion is that he brought it with the intention of\ncutting the throats of his victims, and that, finding they lay in rather\nan untoward position, he changed his mind, and, having carried out the\nobject with which he entered the house, left the knife and, going back,\nbrought the axe with which he effected his purpose. What was the purpose\nof the murderer? Was it the robbery of Dewar's paltry wages? Was it\nthe act of a tiger broken loose on the community? An act of pure wanton\ndevilry? or was there some more reasonable explanation of this most\natrocious crime?\"\n\nButler rejected altogether the theory of ordinary theft. No thief\nof ambitious views, he said, would pitch upon the house of a poor\njourneyman butcher. The killing of the family appeared to him to be\nthe motive: \"an enemy hath done this.\" The murderer seems to have had a\nknowledge of the premises; he enters the house and does his work swiftly\nand promptly, and is gone. \"We cannot know,\" Butler continues, \"all the\npassages in the lives of the murdered man or woman. What can we know of\nthe hundred spites and jealousies or other causes of malice which might\nhave caused the crime? If you say some obscure quarrel, some spite or\njealousy is not likely to have been the cause of so dreadful a murder,\nyou cannot revert to the robbery theory without admitting a motive much\nweaker in all its utter needlessness and vagueness. The prominent\nfeature of the murder, indeed the only feature, is its ruthless,\nunrelenting, determined vindictiveness. Every blow seemed to say, 'You\nshall die you shall not live.'\"\n\nWhether Butler were the murderer of the Dewars or not, the theory that\nrepresented them as having been killed for the purpose of robbery\nhas its weak side all the weaker if Butler, a practical and ambitious\ncriminal, were the guilty man.\n\nIn 1882, two years after Butler's trial, there appeared in a New Zealand\nnewspaper, Society, published in Christchurch, a series of Prison\n\"Portraits,\" written evidently by one who had himself undergone a term\nof imprisonment. One of the \"Portraits\" was devoted to an account of\nButler. The writer had known Butler in prison. According to the story\ntold him by Butler, the latter had arrived in Dunedin with a quantity of\njewellery he had stolen in Australia. This jewellery he entrusted to a\nyoung woman for safe keeping. After serving his first term of two years'\nimprisonment in Dunedin, Butler found on his release that the young\nwoman had married a man of the name of Dewar. Butler went to Mrs. Dewar\nand asked for the return of his jewellery; she refused to give it up. On\nthe night of the murder he called at the house in Cumberland Street and\nmade a last appeal to her, but in vain. He determined on revenge. During\nhis visit to Mrs. Dewar he had had an opportunity of seeing the axe and\nobserving the best way to break into the house. He watched the husband's\nreturn, and decided to kill him as well as his wife on the chance of\nobtaining his week's wages. With the help of the knife which he had\nfound in the backyard of a hotel he opened the window. The husband he\nkilled in his sleep, the woman waked with the first blow he struck her.\nHe found the jewellery in a drawer rolled up in a pair of stockings.\nHe afterwards hid it in a well-marked spot some half-hour before his\narrest.\n\nA few years after its appearance in Society, this account of Butler was\nreproduced in an Auckland newspaper. Bain, the detective, wrote a letter\nquestioning the truth of the writer's statements. He pointed out\nthat when Butler first came to Dunedin he had been at liberty only a\nfortnight before serving his first term of imprisonment, very little\ntime in which to make the acquaintance of a woman and dispose of the\nstolen jewellery. He asked why, if Butler had hidden the jewellery just\nbefore his arrest, he had not also hidden the opera-glasses which he\nhad stolen from Mr. Stamper's house. Neither of these comments is very\nconvincing. A fortnight seems time enough in which a man of Butler's\ncharacter might get to know a woman and dispose of some jewellery;\nwhile, if Butler were the murderer of Mr. Dewar as well as the burglar\nwho had broken into Stamper's house, it was part of his plan to\nacknowledge himself guilty of the latter crime and use it to justify his\nmovements before and after the murder. Bain is more convincing when he\nstates at the conclusion of his letter that he had known Mrs. Dewar from\nchildhood as a \"thoroughly good and true woman,\" who, as far as he knew,\nhad never in her life had any acquaintance with Butler.\n\nAt the same time, the account given by Butler's fellow-prisoner, in\nwhich the conduct of the murdered woman is represented as constituting\nthe provocation for the subsequent crime, explains one peculiar\ncircumstance in connection with the tragedy, the selection of this\njourneyman butcher and his wife as the victims of the murderer. It\nexplains the theory, urged so persistently by Butler in his speech to\nthe jury, that the crime was the work of an enemy of the Dewars, the\noutcome of some hidden spite, or obscure quarrel; it explains the\napparent ferocity of the murder, and the improbability of a practical\nthief selecting such an unprofitable couple as his prey. The rummaged\nchest of drawers and the fact that some trifling articles of jewellery\nwere left untouched on the top of them, are consistent with an eager\nsearch by the murderer for some particular object. Against this theory\nof revenge is the fact that Butler was a malignant ruffian and liar in\nany case, that, having realised very little in cash by the burglary at\nStamper's house, he would not be particular as to where he might get a\nfew shillings more, that he had threatened to do a tigerish deed, and\nthat it is characteristic of his vanity to try to impute to his crime a\nhigher motive than mere greed or necessity.\n\nButler showed himself not averse to speaking of the murder in Cumberland\nStreet to at least one of those, with whom he came in contact in his\nlater years. After he had left New Zealand and returned to Australia,\nhe was walking in a street in Melbourne with a friend when they passed\na lady dressed in black, carrying a baby in her arms. The baby looked\nat the two men and laughed. Butler frowned and walked rapidly away. His\ncompanion chaffed him, and asked whether it was the widow or the baby\nthat he was afraid of. Butler was silent, but after a time asked his\ncompanion to come into some gardens and sit down on one of the seats, as\nhe had something serious to say to him. For a while Butler sat silent.\nThen he asked the other if he had ever been in Dunedin. \"Yes,\" was the\nreply. \"Look here,\" said Butler, \"you are the only man I ever made any\nkind of confidant of. You are a good scholar, though I could teach you\na lot.\" After this gracious compliment he went on: \"I was once tried in\nDunedin on the charge of killing a man, woman and child, and although\ninnocent, the crime was nearly brought home to me. It was my own ability\nthat pulled me through. Had I employed a professional advocate, I should\nnot have been here to-day talking to you.\" After describing the murder,\nButler said: \"Trying to fire the house was unnecessary, and killing\nthe baby was unnecessary and cruel. I respect no man's life, for no man\nrespects mine. A lot of men I have never injured have tried to put a\nrope round my neck more than once. I hate society in general, and one\nor two individuals in particular. The man who did that murder in Dunedin\nhas, if anything, my sympathy, but it seems to me he need not have\nkilled that child.\" His companion was about to speak. Butler stopped\nhim. \"Now, don't ever ask me such a silly question as that,\" he said.\n\"What?\" asked his friend. \"You were about to ask me if I did that deed,\"\nreplied Butler, \"and you know perfectly well that, guilty or innocent,\nthat question would only be answered in one way.\" \"I was about to ask\nnothing of the kind,\" said the other, \"for you have already told me that\nyou were innocent.\" \"Good!\" said Butler, \"then let that be the end of\nthe subject, and never refer to it again, except, perhaps, in your own\nmind, when you can, if you like, remember that I said the killing of the\nchild was unnecessary and cruel.\"\n\nHaving developed to the jury his theory of why the crime was committed,\nButler told them that, as far as he was concerned, there were four\npoints against him on which the Crown relied to prove his guilt.\nFirstly, there was the fact of his being in the neighbourhood of the\ncrime on the Sunday morning; that, he said, applied to scores of other\npeople besides himself. Then there was his alleged disturbed appearance\nand guilty demeanour. The evidence of that was, he contended, doubtful\nin any case, and referable to another cause; as also his leaving Dunedin\nin the way and at the time he did. He scouted the idea that murderers\nare compelled by some invisible force to betray their guilt. \"The doings\nof men,\" he urged, \"and their success are regulated by the amount\nof judgment that they possess, and, without impugning or denying the\nexistence of Providence, I say this is a law that holds good in all\ncases, whether for evil or good. Murderers, if they have the sense and\nability and discretion to cover up their crime, will escape, do escape,\nand have escaped. Many people, when they have gravely shaken their heads\nand said 'Murder will out,' consider they have done a great deal and\ngone a long way towards settling the question. Well, this, like many\nother stock formulas of Old World wisdom, is not true. How many murders\nare there that the world has never heard of, and never will? How many a\nmurdered man, for instance, lies among the gum-trees of Victoria, or\nin the old abandoned mining-shafts on the diggings, who is missed by\nnobody, perhaps, but a pining wife at home, or helpless children, or\nan old mother? But who were their murderers? Where are they? God knows,\nperhaps, but nobody else, and nobody ever will.\" The fact, he said, that\nhe was alleged to have walked up Cumberland Street on the Sunday morning\nand looked in the direction of the Dewars' house was, unless the causes\nof superstition and a vague and incomplete reasoning were to be accepted\nas proof, evidence rather of his innocence than his guilt. He had\nremoved the soles of his boots, he said, in order to ease his feet in\nwalking; the outer soles had become worn and ragged, and in lumps under\nhis feet. He denied that he had told Bain, the detective, that he would\nbreak out as a desperate tiger let loose on the community; what he had\nsaid was that he was tired of living the life of a prairie dog or a\ntiger in the jungle.\n\nButler was more successful when he came to deal with the bloodstains on\nhis clothes. These, he said, were caused by the blood from the scratches\non his hands, which had been observed at the time of his arrest. The\ndoctors had rejected this theory, and said that the spots of blood\nhad been impelled from the axe or from the heads of the victims as the\nmurderer struck the fatal blow. Butler put on the clothes in court, and\nwas successful in showing that the position and appearance of certain\nof the blood spots was not compatible with such a theory. \"I think,\"\nhe said, \"I am fairly warranted in saying that the evidence of these\ngentlemen is, not to put too fine a point on it, worth just nothing at\nall.\"\n\nButler's concluding words to the jury were brief but emphatic: \"I stand\nin a terrible position. So do you. See that in your way of disposing of\nme you deliver yourselves of your responsibilities.\"\n\nIn the exercise of his forbearance towards an undefended prisoner, Mr.\nHaggitt did not address the jury for the Crown. At four o'clock the\njudge commenced his summing-up. Mr. Justice Williams impressed on\nthe jury that they must be satisfied, before they could convict the\nprisoner, that the circumstances of the crime and the prisoner's conduct\nwere inconsistent with any other reasonable hypothesis than his guilt.\nThere was little or no evidence that robbery was the motive of the\ncrime. The circumstance of the prisoner being out all Saturday night and\nin the neighbourhood of the crime on Sunday morning only amounted to\nthe fact that he had an opportunity shared by a great number of other\npersons of committing the murder. The evidence of his agitation and\ndemeanour at the time of his arrest must be accepted with caution. The\nevidence of the blood spots was of crucial importance; there was nothing\nsave this to connect him directly with the crime. The jury must be\nsatisfied that the blood on the clothes corresponded with the blood\nmarks which, in all probability, would be found on the person who\ncommitted the murder. In regard to the medical testimony some caution\nmust be exercised. Where medical gentlemen had made observations, seen\nwith their own eyes, the direct inference might be highly trustworthy,\nbut, when they proceeded to draw further inferences, they might be in\ndanger of looking at facts through the spectacles of theory; \"we know\nthat people do that in other things besides science--politics, religion,\nand so forth.\" Taking the Crown evidence, at its strongest, there was\na missing link; did the evidence of the bloodstains supply it? These\nbloodstains were almost invisible. Could a person be reasonably asked to\nexplain how they came where they did? Could they be accounted for in no\nother reasonable way than that the clothes had been worn by the murderer\nof the Dewars?\n\nIn spite of a summing-up distinctly favourable to the prisoner, the jury\nwere out three hours. According to one account of their proceedings,\ntold to the writer, there was at first a majority of the jurymen in\nfavour of conviction. But it was Saturday night; if they could not come\nto a decision they were in danger of being locked up over Sunday. For\nthis reason the gentleman who held an obstinate and unshaken belief that\nthe crime was the work of a homicidal maniac found an unexpected ally in\na prominent member of a church choir who was down to sing a solo in his\nchurch on Sunday, and was anxious not to lose such an opportunity for\ndistinction. Whatever the cause, after three hours' deliberation the\njury returned a verdict of \"Not Guilty.\" Later in the Session Butler\npleaded guilty to the burglary at Mr. Stamper's house, and was sentenced\nto eighteen years' imprisonment. The severity of this sentence was not,\nthe judge said, intended to mark the strong suspicion under which Butler\nlaboured of being a murderer as well as a burglar.\n\nThe ends of justice had been served by Butler's acquittal. But in the\nlight of after events, it is perhaps unfortunate that the jury did not\nstretch a point and so save the life of Mr. Munday of Toowong. Butler\nunderwent his term of imprisonment in Littleton Jail. There his\nreputation was most unenviable. He is described by a fellow prisoner as\nill-tempered, malicious, destructive, but cowardly and treacherous. He\nseems to have done little or no work; he looked after the choir and the\nlibrary, but was not above breaking up the one and smashing the other,\nif the fit seized him.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nHIS DECLINE AND FALL\n\n\nIn 1896 Butler was released from prison. The news of his release was\ndescribed as falling like a bombshell among the peaceful inhabitants\nof Dunedin. In the colony of Victoria, where Butler had commenced his\ncareer, it was received with an apprehension that was justified by\nsubsequent events. It was believed that on his release the New Zealand\nauthorities had shipped Butler off to Rio. But it was not long before he\nmade his way once more to Australia. From the moment of his arrival\nin Melbourne he was shadowed by the police. One or two mysterious\noccurrences soon led to his arrest. On June 5 he was sentenced to twelve\nmonths' imprisonment under the Criminal Influx Act, which makes it a\npenal offence for any convict to enter Victoria for three years\nafter his release from prison. Not content with this, the authorities\ndetermined to put Butler on trial on two charges of burglary and one of\nhighway robbery, committed since his return to the colony. To one charge\nof burglary, that of breaking into a hairdresser's shop and stealing a\nwig, some razors and a little money, Butler pleaded guilty.\n\nBut the charge of highway robbery, which bore a singular resemblance\nto the final catastrophe in Queensland, he resisted to the utmost, and\nshowed that his experience in the Supreme Court at Dunedin had not been\nlost on him. At half-past six one evening in a suburb of Melbourne an\nelderly gentleman found himself confronted by a bearded man, wearing a\nlong overcoat and a boxer hat and flourishing a revolver, who told him\nabruptly to \"turn out his pockets.\" The old man did ashe was told. The\nrobber then asked for his watch and chain, saying \"Business must\nbe done.\" The old gentleman mildly urged that this was a dangerous\nbusiness. On being assured that the watch was a gold one, the robber\nappeared willing to risk the danger, and departed thoroughly satisfied.\nThe old gentleman afterwards identified Butler as the man who had taken\nhis watch. Another elderly man swore that he had seen Butler at the time\nof the robbery in the possession of a fine gold watch, which he said had\nbeen sent him from home. But the watch had not been found in Butler's\npossession.\n\nOn June 18 Butler was put on his trial in the Melbourne Criminal\nCourt before Mr. Justice Holroyd, charged with robbery under arms. His\nappearance in the dock aroused very considerable interest. \"It was the\ngeneral verdict,\" wrote one newspaper, \"that his intellectual head and\nforehead compared not unfavourably with those of the judge.\" He\nwas decently dressed and wore pince-nez, which he used in the best\nprofessional manner as he referred to the various documents that lay in\nfront of him. He went into the witness-box and stated that the evening\nof the crime he had spent according to his custom in the Public Library.\n\nFor an hour and a half he addressed the jury. He disputed the\npossibility of his identification by his alleged victim. He was \"an old\ngentleman of sedentary pursuits and not cast in the heroic mould.\" Such\na man would be naturally alarmed and confused at meeting suddenly an\narmed robber. Now, under these circumstances, could his recognition of\na man whose face was hidden by a beard, his head by a boxer hat, and his\nbody by a long overcoat, be considered trustworthy? And such recognition\noccurring in the course of a chance encounter in the darkness, that\nfruitful mother of error? The elderly gentleman had described his\nmoustache as a slight one, but the jury could see that it was full and\noverhanging. He complained that he had been put up for identification\nsingly, not with other men, according to the usual custom; the police\nhad said to the prosecutor: \"We have here a man that we think robbed\nyou, and, if he is not the man, we shall be disappointed,\" to which\nthe prosecutor had replied: \"Yes, and if he is not the man, I shall be\ndisappointed too.\" For the elderly person who had stated that he had\nseen a gold watch in Butler's possession the latter had nothing but\nscorn. He was a \"lean and slippered pantaloon in Shakespeare's last\nstage\"; and he, Butler, would have been a lunatic to have confided in\nsuch a man.\n\nThe jury acquitted Butler, adding as a rider to their verdict that there\nwas not sufficient evidence of identification. The third charge against\nButler was not proceeded with. He was put up to receive sentence for the\nburglary at the hairdresser's shop. Butler handed to the judge a written\nstatement which Mr. Justice Holroyd described as a narrative that\nmight have been taken from those sensational newspapers written for\nnursery-maids, and from which, he said, he could not find that Butler\nhad ever done one good thing in the whole course of his life. Of that\nlife of fifty years Butler had spent thirty-five in prison. The judge\nexpressed his regret that a man of Butler's knowledge, information,\nvanity, and utter recklessness of what evil will do, could not be put\naway somewhere for the rest of his life, and sentenced him to fifteen\nyears' imprisonment with hard labour. \"An iniquitous and brutal\nsentence!\" exclaimed the prisoner. After a brief altercation with the\njudge, who said that he could hardly express the scorn he felt for such\na man, Butler was removed. The judge subsequently reduced the sentence\nto one of ten years. Chance or destiny would seem implacable in their\npursuit of Mr. William Munday of Toowong.\n\nButler after his trial admitted that it was he who had robbed the old\ngentleman of his watch, and described to the police the house in which\nit was hidden. When the police went there to search they found that the\nhouse had been pulled down, but among the debris they discovered a brown\npaper parcel containing the old gentleman's gold watch and chain, a\nfive-chambered revolver, a keen-edged butcher's knife, and a mask.\n\nButler served his term of imprisonment in Victoria, \"an unmitigated\nnuisance\" to his custodians. On his release in 1904, he made, as in\nDunedin, an attempt to earn a living by his pen. He contributed some\narticles to a Melbourne evening paper on the inconveniences of prison\ndiscipline, but he was quite unfitted for any sustained effort as a\njournalist. According to his own account, with the little money he had\nleft he made his way to Sydney, thence to Brisbane. He was half-starved,\nbewildered, despairing; in his own words, \"if a psychological camera\ncould have been turned on me it would have shown me like a bird\nfascinated by a serpent, fascinated and bewildered by the fate in front,\nbehind, and around me.\" Months of suffering and privation passed, months\nof tramping hundreds of miles with occasional breakdowns, months of\nhunger and sickness; \"my actions had become those of a fool; my mind and\nwill had become a remnant guided or misguided by unreasoning impulse.\"\n\nIt was under the influence of such an impulse that on March 23 Butler\nhad met and shot Mr. Munday at Toowong. On May 24 he was arraigned at\nBrisbane before the Supreme Court of Queensland. But the Butler who\nstood in the dock of the Brisbane Criminal Court was very different\nfrom the Butler who had successfully defended himself at Dunedin and\nMelbourne. The spirit had gone out of him; it was rather as a suppliant,\nrepresented by counsel, that he faced the charge of murder. His attitude\nwas one of humble and appropriate penitence. In a weak and nervous voice\nhe told the story of his hardships since his release from his Victorian\nprison; he would only urge that the shooting of Mr. Munday was\naccidental, caused by Munday picking up a stone and attacking him. When\nabout to be sentenced to death he expressed great sorrow and contrition\nfor his crime, for the poor wife and children of his unfortunate victim.\nHis life, he said, was a poor thing, but he would gladly give it fifty\ntimes over.\n\nThe sentence of death was confirmed by the Executive on June 30. To\na Freethought advocate who visited him shortly before his execution,\nButler wrote a final confession of faith: \"I shall have to find my way\nacross the harbour bar without the aid of any pilot. In these matters\nI have for many years carried an exempt flag, and, as it has not been\ncarried through caprice or ignorance, I am compelled to carry it to the\nlast. There is an impassable bar of what I honestly believe to be the\ninexorable logic of philosophy and facts, history and experience of the\nnature of the world, the human race and myself, between me and the\nviews of the communion of any religious organisation. So instead of the\n'depart Christian soul' of the priest, I only hope for the comfort and\nsatisfaction of the last friendly good-bye of any who cares to give it.\"\n\nFrom this positive affirmation of unbelief Butler wilted somewhat at the\napproach of death. The day before his execution he spent half an hour\nplaying hymns on the church organ in the prison; and on the scaffold,\nwhere his agitation rendered him almost speechless, he expressed his\nsorrow for what he had done, and the hope that, if there were a heaven,\nmercy would be shown him.\n\n\n\n\nM. Derues\n\n\nThe last word on Derues has been said by M. Georges Claretie in his\nexcellent monograph, \"Derues L'Empoisonneur,\" Paris. 1907. There is a\nfull account of the case in Vol. V. of Fouquier, \"Causes Celebres.\"\n\nI\n\nTHE CLIMBING LITTLE GROCER\n\nM. Etienne Saint-Faust de Lamotte, a provincial nobleman of ancient\nlineage and moderate health, ex-equerry to the King, desired in\nthe year 1774 to dispose of a property in the country, the estate of\nBuisson-Souef near Villeneuve-le-Roi, which he had purchased some ten\nyears before out of money acquired by a prudent marriage.\n\nWith an eye to the main chance M. de Lamotte had in 1760 ran away with\nthe daughter of a wealthy citizen of Rheims, who was then staying with\nher sister in Paris. They lived together in the country for some time,\nand a son was born to them, whom the father legitimised by subsequently\nmarrying the mother. For a few years M. and Mme. de Lamotte dwelt\nhappily together at Buisson-Souef. But as their boy grew up they became\nanxious to leave the country and return to Paris, where M. de Lamotte\nhoped to be able to obtain for his son some position about the Court of\nLouis XVI. And so it was that in May, 1775, M. de Lamotte gave a\npower of attorney to his wife in order that she might go to Paris\nand negotiate for the sale of Buisson-Souef. The legal side of the\ntransaction was placed in the hands of one Jolly, a proctor at the\nChatelet in Paris.\n\nNow the proctor Jolly had a client with a great desire to acquire a\nplace in the country, M. Derues de Cyrano de Bury, lord of Candeville,\nHerchies, and other places. Here was the very man to comply with\nthe requirements of the de Lamottes, and such a pleasing, ready,\naccommodating gentleman into the bargain! Very delicate to all\nappearances, strangely pale, slight, fragile in build, with his\nbeardless chin and feminine cast of feature, there was something\ncat-like in the soft insinuating smile of this seemingly most amiable,\ncandid and pious of men. Always cheerful and optimistic, it was quite\na pleasure to do business with M. Derues de Cyrano de Bury. The\nde Lamottes after one or two interviews were delighted with their\nprospective purchaser. Everything was speedily settled. M. Derues and\nhis wife, a lady belonging to the distinguished family of Nicolai,\nvisited Buisson-Souef. They were enchanted with what they saw, and their\nhosts were hardly less enchanted with their visitors. By the end of\nDecember, 1775, the purchase was concluded. M. Derues was to give\n130,000 livres (about L20,000) for the estate, the payments to be made\nby instalments, the first of 12,000 livres to be paid on the actual\nsigning of the contract of sale, which, it was agreed, was to be\nconcluded not later than the first of June, 1776. In the meantime, as an\nearnest of good faith, M. Derues gave Mme. de Lamotte a bill for 4,200\nlivres to fall due on April 1, 1776.\n\nWhat could be more satisfactory? That M. Derues was a substantial person\nthere could be no doubt. Through his wife he was entitled to a sum of\n250,000 livres as her share of the property of a wealthy kinsman, one\nDespeignes-Duplessis, a country gentleman, who some four years before\nhad been found murdered in his house under mysterious circumstances.\nThe liquidation of the Duplessis inheritance, as soon as the law's delay\ncould be overcome, would place the Derues in a position of affluence\nfitting a Cyrano de Bury and a Nicolai.\n\nAt this time M. Derues was in reality far from affluent. In point of\nfact he was insolvent. Nor was his lineage, nor that of his wife, in any\nway distinguished. He had no right to call himself de Cyrano de Bury or\nLord of Candeville. His wife's name was Nicolais, not Nicolai--a very\nimportant difference from the genealogical point of view. The Duplessis\ninheritance, though certainly existent, would seem to have had little\nmore chance of realisation than the mythical Crawford millions of Madame\nHumbert. And yet, crippled with debt, without a penny in the world,\nthis daring grocer of the Rue Beaubourg, for such was M. Derues'\npresent condition in life, could cheerfully and confidently engage in\na transaction as considerable as the purchase of a large estate for\n130,000 livres! The origin of so enterprising a gentleman is worthy of\nattention.\n\nAntoine Francois Derues was born at Chartres in 1744; his father was a\ncorn merchant. His parents died when he was three years old. For some\ntime after his birth he was assumed to be a girl; it was not until\nhe was twelve years old that an operation determined his sex to be\nmasculine. Apprenticed by his relatives to a grocer, Derues succeeded\nso well in the business that he was able in 1770 to set up on his\nown account in Paris, and in 1772 he married. Among the grocer's\nmany friends and acquaintances this marriage created something of a\nsensation, for Derues let it be known that the lady of his choice was of\nnoble birth and an heiress. The first statement was untrue. The lady\nwas one Marie Louise Nicolais, daughter of a non-commissioned artillery\nofficer, turned coachbuilder. But by suppressing the S at the end of her\nname, which Derues was careful also to erase in his marriage contract,\nthe ambitious grocer was able to describe his wife as connected with\nthe noble house of Nicolai, one of the most distinguished of the great\nFrench families.\n\nThere was more truth in the statement that Mme. Derues was an heiress. A\nkinsman of her mother, Beraud by name, had become the heir to a certain\nMarquis Desprez. Beraud was the son of a small merchant. His mother\nhad married a second time, the husband being the Marquis Desprez, and\nthrough her Beraud had inherited the Marquis' property. According to the\ncustom of the time, Beraud, on coming into his inheritance, took a\ntitle from one of his estates and called himself thenceforth the lord of\nDespeignes-Duplessis. A rude, solitary, brutal man, devoted to sport,\nhe lived alone in his castle of Candeville, hated by his neighbours, a\nterror to poachers. One day he was found lying dead in his bedroom; he\nhad been shot in the chest; the assassin had escaped through an open\nwindow.\n\nThe mystery of Beraud's murder was never solved. His estate of 200,000\nlivres was divided among three cousins, of whom the mother of Mme.\nDerues was one. Mme. Derues herself was entitled to a third of his\nmother's share of the estate, that is, one-ninth of the whole. But in\n1775 Derues acquired the rest of the mother's share on condition that\nhe paid her an annual income of 1,200 livres. Thus on the liquidation\nof the Duplessis inheritance Mme. Derues would be entitled nominally to\nsome 66,500 livres, about L11,000 in English money. But five years had\npassed since the death of Despeignes-Duplessis, and the estate was still\nin the slow process of legal settlement. If Derues were to receive the\nfull third of the Duplessis inheritance--a very unlikely supposition\nafter four years of liquidation--66,000 livres would not suffice to pay\nhis ordinary debts quite apart from the purchase money of Buisson-Souef.\nHis financial condition was in the last degree critical. Not content\nwith the modest calling of a grocer, Derues had turned money-lender,\na money-lender to spendthrift and embarrassed noblemen. Derues dearly\nloved a lord; he wanted to become one himself; it delighted him to\nreceive dukes and marquises at the Rue Beaubourg, even if they came\nthere with the avowed object of raising the wind. The smiling grocer, in\nhis everlasting bonnet and flowered dressing-gown a la J. J. Rousseau,\nwas ever ready to oblige the needy scion of a noble house. What he\nborrowed at moderate interest from his creditors he lent at enhanced\ninterest to the quality. Duns and bailiffs jostled the dukes and\nmarquises whose presence at the Rue Beaubourg so impressed the wondering\nneighbours of the facile grocer.\n\nThis aristocratic money-lending proved a hopeless trade; it only plunged\nDerues deeper and deeper into the mire of financial disaster. The\nnoblemen either forgot to pay while they were alive, or on their death\nwere found to be insolvent. Derues was driven to ordering goods and\nmerchandise on credit, and selling them at a lower price for ready\nmoney. Victims of this treatment began to press him seriously for their\nmoney or their goods. Desperately he continued to fence them off with\nthe long expected windfall of the Duplessis inheritance.\n\nParis was getting too hot for him. Gay and irrepressible as he was, the\nstrain was severe. If he could only find some retreat in the country\nwhere he might enjoy at once refuge from his creditors and the rank and\nconsequence of a country gentleman! Nothing--no fear, no disappointment,\nno disaster--could check the little grocer's ardent and overmastering\ndesire to be a gentleman indeed, a landed proprietor, a lord or\nsomething or other. At the beginning of 1775 he had purchased a place\nnear Rueil from a retired coffeehouse-keeper, paying 1,000 livres on\naccount, but the non-payment of the rest of the purchase-money had\nresulted in the annulment of the contract. Undefeated, Derues only\ndetermined to fly the higher. Having failed to pay 9,000 livres for a\nmodest estate near Rueil, he had no hesitation in pledging himself to\npay 130,000 livres for the lordly domain of Buisson-Souef. So great were\nhis pride and joy on the conclusion of the latter bargain that he amused\nhimself by rehearsing on paper his future style and title: \"Antoine\nFrancois de Cyrano Derues de Bury, Seigneur de Buisson-Souef et Valle\nProfonde.\" He is worthy of Thackeray's pen, this little grocer-snob,\nwith his grand and ruinous acquaintance with the noble and the great,\nhis spurious titles, his unwearied climbing of the social ladder.\n\nThe confiding, if willing, dupe of aristocratic impecuniosity, Derues\nwas a past master of the art of duping others. From the moment of the\npurchase of Buisson-Souef all his art was employed in cajoling the\ntrusting and simple de Lamottes. Legally Buisson-Souef was his from the\nsigning of the agreement in December, 1775. His first payment was due\nin April, 1776. Instead of making it, Derues went down to Buisson-Souef\nwith his little girl, and stayed there as the guests of the de Lamottes\nfor six months. His good humour and piety won all hearts. The village\npriest especially derived great satisfaction from the society of so\ndevout a companion. He entertained his good friends, the merry little\nman, by dressing up as a woman, a role his smooth face and effeminate\nfeatures well fitted him to play. If business were alluded to, the merry\ngentleman railed at the delay and chicanery of lawyers; it was that\nalone that postponed the liquidation of the Duplessis inheritance; as\nsoon as the lawyers could be got rid of, the purchase-money of his new\nestate would be promptly paid up. But as time went on and no payment was\nforthcoming the de Lamottes began to feel a little uneasy. As soon as\nDerues had departed in November M. de Lamotte decided to send his\nwife to Paris to make further inquiries and, if possible, bring their\npurchaser up to the scratch. Mme. de Lamotte had developed into a stout,\nindolent woman, of the Mrs. Bloss type, fond of staying in bed and\ntaking heavy meals. Her son, a fat, lethargic youth of fourteen,\naccompanied his mother.\n\nOn hearing of Mme. de Lamotte's contemplated visit to Paris, Derues was\nfilled with alarm. If she were living free and independent in Paris she\nmight find out the truth about the real state of his affairs, and then\ngood-bye to Buisson-Souef and landed gentility! No, if Mme. de Lamotte\nwere to come to Paris, she must come as the guest of the Derues,\na pleasant return for the hospitality accorded to the grocer at\nBuisson-Souef. The invitation was given and readily accepted; M. de\nLamotte still had enough confidence in and liking for the Derues to be\nglad of the opportunity of placing his wife under their roof. And so it\nwas that on December 16, 1776, Mme. de Lamotte arrived at Paris and took\nup her abode at the house of the Derues in the Rue Beaubourg Her son she\nplaced at a private school in a neighbouring street.\n\nTo Derues there was now one pressing and immediate problem to be\nsolved--how to keep Buisson-Souef as his own without paying for it? To\none less sanguine, less daring, less impudent and desperate in his need,\nthe problem would have appeared insoluble.\n\nBut that was by no means the view of the cheery and resourceful grocer.\nHe had a solution ready, well thought out and bearing to his mind\nthe stamp of probability. He would make a fictitious payment of the\npurchase-money to Mme. de Lamotte. She would then disappear, taking her\nson with her. Her indiscretion in having been the mistress of de Lamotte\nbefore she became his wife, would lend colour to his story that she had\ngone off with a former lover, taking with her the money which Derues\nhad paid her for Buisson-Souef. He would then produce the necessary\ndocuments proving the payment of the purchase-money, and Buisson-Souef\nwould be his for good and all.\n\nThe prime necessity to the success of this plan was the disappearance,\nwilling or unwilling, of Mme. de Lamotte and her son. The former had\nsettled down quite comfortably beneath the hospitable roof of the\nDerues, and under the soothing influence of her host showed little\nvigour in pressing him for the money due to herself and her husband. She\nhad already spent a month in quietly enjoying Paris and the society of\nher friends when, towards the end of January, 1770, her health and that\nof her son began to fail. Mme. de Lamotte was seized with sickness and\ninternal trouble. Though Derues wrote to her husband that his wife was\nwell and their business was on the point of conclusion, by the 30th of\nJanuary Mme. de Lamotte had taken to her bed, nursed and physicked by\nthe ready Derues. On the 31st the servant at the Rue Beaubourg was\ntold that she could go to her home at Montrouge, whither Derues had\npreviously sent his two children. Mme. Derues, who was in an interesting\ncondition, was sent out for an hour by her husband to do some shopping.\nDerues was alone with his patient.\n\nIn the evening a friend, one Bertin, came to dine with Derues. Bertin\nwas a short, hustling, credulous, breathless gentleman, always in a\nhurry, with a great belief in the abilities of M. Derues. He found the\nlittle man in excellent spirits. Bertin asked if he could see Mme. de\nLamotte. Mme. Derues said that that was impossible, but that her husband\nhad given her some medicine which was working splendidly. The young de\nLamotte called to see his mother. Derues took him into her room; in the\ndim light the boy saw her sleeping, and crept out quietly for fear of\ndisturbing her. The Derues and their friends sat down to dinner. Derues\nkept jumping up and running into the sick room, from which a horrible\nsmell began to pervade the house. But Derues was radiant at the success\nof his medicine. \"Was there ever such a nurse as I am?\" he exclaimed.\nBertin remarked that he thought it was a woman's and not a man's place\nto nurse a lady under such distressing circumstances. Derues protested\nthat it was an occupation he had always liked. Next day, February 1, the\nservant was still at Montrouge; Mme. Derues was again sent out shopping;\nagain Derues was alone with his patient. But she was a patient no\nlonger; she had become a corpse. The highly successful medicine\nadministered to the poor lady by her jolly and assiduous nurse had\nindeed worked wonders.\n\nDerues had bought a large leather trunk. It is possible that to Derues\nbelongs the distinction of being the first murderer to put that harmless\nand necessary article of travel to a criminal use. He was engaged in\nhis preparations for coffining Mme. de Lamotte, when a female creditor\nknocked insistently at the door. She would take no denial. Clad in his\nbonnet and gown, Derues was compelled to admit her. She saw the\nlarge trunk, and suspected a bolt on the part of her creditor. Derues\nreassured her; a lady, he said, who had been stopping with them was\nreturning to the country. The creditor departed. Later in the day Derues\ncame out of the house and summoned some porters. With their help the\nheavy trunk was taken to the house of a sculptor, a friend of Derues,\nwho agreed to keep it in his studio until Derues could take it down to\nhis place in the country. Bertin came in to dinner again that evening,\nand also the young de Lamotte. Derues was gayer than ever, laughing\nand joking with his guests. He told the boy that his mother had quite\nrecovered and gone to Versailles to see about finding him some post at\nthe Court. \"We'll go and see her there in a day or two,\" he said, \"I'll\nlet you know when.\"\n\nOn the following day a smartly dressed, dapper, but very pale little\ngentleman, giving the name of Ducoudray, hired a vacant cellar in a\nhouse in the Rue de la Mortellerie. He had, he said, some Spanish wine\nhe wanted to store there, and three or four days later M. Ducoudray\ndeposited in this cellar a large grey trunk. A few days after he\nemployed a man to dig a large hole in the floor of the cellar, giving as\nhis reason for such a proceeding that \"there was no way of keeping wine\nlike burying it.\" While the man worked at the job, his genial employer\nbeguiled his labours with merry quips and tales, which he illustrated\nwith delightful mimicry. The hole dug, the man was sent about his\nbusiness. \"I will bury the wine myself,\" said his employer, and on one\nor two occasions M. Ducoudray was seen by persons living in the house\ngoing in and out of his cellar, a lighted candle in his hand. One day\nthe pale little gentleman was observed leaving the cellar, accompanied\nby a porter carrying a large trunk, and after that the dwellers in the\nRue de la Mortellerie saw the pale little gentleman no more.\n\nA few days later M. Derues sent down to his place at Buisson-Souef a\nlarge trunk filled with china. It was received there by M. de Lamotte.\nLittle did the trusting gentleman guess that it was in this very trunk\nthat the body of his dear wife had been conveyed to its last resting\nplace in the cellar of M. Ducoudray in the Rue de la Mortellerie. Nor\nhad M. Mesvrel-Desvergers, importunate creditor of M. Derues, guessed\nthe contents of the large trunk that he had met his debtor one day\nearly in February conveying through the streets of Paris. Creditors\nwere always interrupting Derues at inconvenient moments. M.\nMesvrel-Desvergers had tapped Derues on the shoulder, reminded him\nforcibly of his liability towards him, and spoken darkly of possible\nimprisonment. Derues pointed to the trunk. It contained, he said, a\nsample of wine; he was going to order some more of it, and he would then\nbe in a position to pay his debt. But the creditor, still doubting, had\nM. Derues followed, and ascertained that he had deposited his sample of\nwine at a house in the Rue de la Mortellerie.\n\nOn Wednesday, February 12, a M. Beaupre of Commercy arrived at\nVersailles with his nephew, a fat boy, in reality some fourteen years of\nage, but given out as older. They hired a room at the house of a cooper\nnamed Pecquet. M. Beaupre was a very pale little gentleman, who seemed\nin excellent spirits, in spite of the fact that his nephew was clearly\nanything but well. Indeed, so sick and ailing did he appear to be that\nMme. Pecquet suggested that his uncle should call in a doctor. But\nM. Beaupre said that that was quite unnecessary; he had no faith in\ndoctors; he would give the boy a good purge. His illness was due, he\nsaid, to a venereal disorder and the drugs which he had been taking in\norder to cure it; it was a priest the boy needed rather than a\ndoctor. On the Thursday and Friday the boy's condition showed little\nimprovement; the vomiting continued. But on Saturday M. Beaupre declared\nhimself as highly delighted with the success of his medicine. The same\nnight the boy was dead. The priest, urgently sent for by his devout\nuncle, arrived to find a corpse. On the following day \"Louis Anotine\nBeaupre, aged twenty-two and a half,\" was buried at Versailles, his\npious uncle leaving with the priest six livres to pay for masses for the\nrepose of his erring nephew's soul.\n\nThe same evening M. Derues who, according to his own account, had left\nParis with the young de Lamotte in order to take the boy to his mother\nin Versailles, returned home to the Rue Beaubourg. As usual, Bertin\ndropped in to dinner. He found his host full of merriment, singing in\nthe lightness of his heart. Indeed, he had reason to be pleased, for\nat last, he told his wife and his friend, Buisson-Souef was his. He had\nseen Mme. de Lamotte at Versailles and paid her the full purchase-money\nin good, sounding gold. And, best joke of all, Mme. de Lamotte had no\nsooner settled the business than she had gone off with a former lover,\nher son and her money, and would in all probability never be heard of\nagain. The gay gentleman laughingly reminded his hearers that such an\nescapade on the part of Mme. de Lamotte was hardly to be wondered at,\nwhen they recollected that her son had been born out of wedlock.\n\nTo all appearances Mme. de Lamotte had undoubtedly concluded the sale of\nBuisson-Souef to Derues and received the price of it before disappearing\nwith her lover. Derues had in his possession a deed of sale signed\nby Mme. de Lamotte and acknowledging the payment to her by Derues of\n100,000 livres, which he had borrowed for that purpose from an advocate\nof the name of Duclos. As a fact the loan from Duclos to Derues was\nfictitious. A legal document proving the loan had been drawn up, but the\ncash which the notary had demanded to see before executing the document\nhad been borrowed for a few hours. Duclos, a provincial advocate,\nhad acted in good faith, in having been represented to him that such\nfictitious transactions were frequently used in Paris for the purpose\nof getting over some temporary financial difficulty. On the 15th of\nFebruary the deed of the sale of Buisson-Souef had been brought by a\nwoman to the office of a scrivener employed by Derues; it was already\nsigned, but the woman asked that certain blanks should be filled in and\nthat the document should be dated. She was told that the date should\nbe that of the day on which the parties had signed it. She gave it as\nFebruary 12. A few days later Derues called at the office and was told\nof the lady's visit. \"Ah!\" he said, \"it was Mme. de Lamotte herself, the\nlady who sold me the estate.\"\n\nIn the meantime Derues, through his bustling and ubiquitous friend\nBertin, took good care that the story of Mme. de Lamotte's sale of\nBuisson-Souef and subsequent elopement should be spread sedulously\nabroad. By Bertin it was told to M. Jolly, the proctor in whose hands\nthe de Lamottes had placed the sale of Buisson-Souef. It was M. Jolly\nwho had in the first instance recommended to them his client Derues as a\npossible purchaser. The proctor, who knew Mme. de Lamotte to be a woman\ndevoted to her husband and her home, was astonished to hear of her\ninfidelity, more especially as the story told by Derues represented her\nas saying in very coarse terms how little she cared for her husband's\nhonour. He was surprised, too, that she should not have consulted\nhim about the conclusion of the business with Derues, and that Derues\nhimself should have been able to find so considerable a sum of money as\n100,000 livres. But, said M. Jolly, if he were satisfied that Mme. de\nLamotte had taken away the money with her, then he would deliver up to\nDerues the power of attorney which M. de Lamotte had left with him in\n1775, giving his wife authority to carry out the sale of Buisson-Souef.\nMme. de Lamotte, being a married woman, the sale of the property to\nDerues would be legally invalid if the husband's power of attorney were\nnot in the hands of the purchaser.\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE GAME OF BLUFF\n\n\nTo Derues, on the eve of victory, the statement of Jolly in regard to\nthe power of attorney was a serious reverse. He had never thought of\nsuch an instrument, or he would have persuaded Mme. de Lamotte to have\ngotten permission of it before her disappearance. Now he must try to get\nit from Jolly himself. On the 26th of February he once again raised from\na friendly notary a few thousand livres on the Duplessis inheritance,\nand deposited the deed of sale of Buisson-Souef as further security.\nHis pocket full of gold, he went straight to the office of Jolly. To the\nsurprise of the proctor Derues announced that he had come to pay him 200\nlivres which he owed him, and apologised for the delay. Taking the\ngold coins from his pockets he filled his three-cornered hat with\nconsiderably more than the sum due, and held it out invitingly to\nM. Jolly. Then he proceeded to tell him of his dealings with Mme. de\nLamotte. She had offered, he said, to get the power of attorney for him,\nbut he, trusting in her good faith, had said that there was no occasion\nfor hurry; and then, faithless, ungrateful woman that she was, she had\ngone off with his money and left him in the lurch. \"But,\" he added, \"I\ntrust you absolutely, M. Jolly, you have all my business in your hands,\nand I shall be a good client in the future. You have the power of\nattorney--you will give it to me?\" and he rattled the coins in his\nhat. \"I must have it,\" he went on, \"I must have it at any price at any\nprice,\" and again the coins danced in his hat, while his eyes looked\nknowingly at the proctor. M. Jolly saw his meaning, and his surprise\nturned to indignation. He told Derues bluntly that he did not believe\nhis story, that until he was convinced of its truth he would not part\nwith the power of attorney, and showed the confounded grocer the door.\n\nDerues hastened home filled with wrath, and took counsel with his friend\nBertin. Bertin knew something of legal process; they would try whether\nthe law could not be invoked to compel Jolly to surrender the power of\nattorney. Bertin went off to the Civil Lieutenant and applied for an\norder to oblige M. Jolly to give up the document in question. An order\nwas made that Jolly must either surrender it into the hands of Derues or\nappear before a referee and show cause why he should not comply with\nthe order. Jolly refused still to give it up or allow a copy of it to be\nmade, and agreed to appear before the referee to justify his action. In\nthe meantime Derues, greatly daring, had started for Buisson-Souef to\ntry what \"bluff\" could do in this serious crisis in his adventure.\n\nAt Buisson-Souef poor M. de Lamotte waited, puzzled and distressed,\nfor news from his wife. On Saturday, 17th, the day after the return of\nDerues from Versailles, he heard from Mme. Derues that his wife had left\nParis and gone with her son to Versailles. A second letter told him that\nshe had completed the sale of Buisson-Souef to Derues, and was still at\nVersailles trying to obtain some post for the boy. On February 19 Mme.\nDerues wrote again expressing surprise that M. de Lamotte had not had\nany letter from his wife and asking if he had received some oysters\nwhich the Derues had sent him. The distracted husband was in no mood for\noysters. \"Do not send me oysters,\" he writes, \"I am too ill with worry.\nI thank you for all your kindness to my son. I love him better than\nmyself, and God grant he will be good and grateful.\" The only reply he\nreceived from the Derues was an assurance that he would see his wife\nagain in a few days.\n\nThe days passed, but Mme. de Lamotte made no sign. About four o'clock on\nthe afternoon of February 28, Derues, accompanied by the parish\npriest of Villeneuvele-Roi, presented himself before M. de Lamotte at\nBuisson-Souef. For the moment M. de Lamotte was rejoiced to see\nthe little man; at last he would get news of his wife. But he was\ndisappointed. Derues could tell him only what he had been told already,\nthat his wife had sold their estate and gone away with the money.\n\nM. de Lamotte was hardly convinced. How, he asked Derues, had he found\nthe 100,000 livres to buy Buisson-Souef, he who had not a halfpenny a\nshort time ago? Derues replied that he had borrowed it from a friend;\nthat there was no use in talking about it; the place was his now, his\nalone, and M. de Lamotte had no longer a right to be there; he was very\nsorry, poor dear gentleman, that his wife had gone off and left him\nwithout a shilling, but personally he would always be a friend to him\nand would allow him 3,000 livres a year for the rest of his life. In the\nmeantime, he said, he had already sold forty casks of the last year's\nvintage, and would be obliged if M. de Lamotte would see to their being\nsent off at once.\n\nBy this time the anger and indignation of M. de Lamotte blazed forth. He\ntold Derues that his story was a pack of lies, that he was still master\nat Buisson-Souef, and not a bottle of wine should leave it. \"You are\ntorturing me,\" he exclaimed, \"I know something has happened to my wife\nand child. I am coming to Paris myself, and if it is as I fear,\nyou shall answer for it with your head!\" Derues, undismayed by this\noutburst, re-asserted his ownership and departed in defiant mood,\nleaving on the premises a butcher of the neighbourhood to look after his\nproperty.\n\nBut things were going ill with Derues. M. de Lamotte meant to show\nfight; he would have powerful friends to back him; class against class,\nthe little grocer would be no match for him. It was immediate possession\nof Buisson-Souef that Derues wanted, not lawsuits; they were expensive\nand the results uncertain. He spoke freely to his friends of the\ndifficulties of the situation.\n\nWhat could he do? The general opinion seemed to be that some fresh\nnews of Mme. de Lamotte--her reappearance, perhaps--would be the\nonly effective settlement of the dispute. He had made Mme. de Lamotte\ndisappear, why should he not make her reappear? He was not the man to\nstick at trifles. His powers of female impersonation, with which he\nhad amused his good friends at Buisson-Souef, could now be turned to\npractical account. On March 5 he left Paris again.\n\nOn the evening of March 7 a gentleman, M. Desportes of Paris, hired a\nroom at the Hotel Blanc in Lyons. On the following day he went out early\nin the morning, leaving word that, should a lady whom he was expecting,\ncall to see him, she was to be shown up to his room. The same morning a\ngentleman, resembling M. Desportes of Paris, bought two lady's dresses\nat a shop in Lyons.\n\nThe same afternoon a lady dressed in black silk, with a hood well drawn\nover her eyes, called at the office of M. Pourra, a notary.\n\nThe latter was not greatly attracted by his visitor, whose nose struck\nhim as large for a woman. She said that she had spent her youth in\nLyons, but her accent was distinctly Parisian. The lady gave her name as\nMadame de Lamotte, and asked for a power of attorney by which she could\ngive her husband the interest due to her on a sum of 30,000 livres,\npart of the purchase-money of the estate of Buisson-Souef, which she\nhad recently sold. As Mme. de Lamotte represented herself as having been\nsent to M. Pourra by a respectable merchant for whom he was in the\nhabit of doing business, he agreed to draw up the necessary document,\naccepting her statement that she and her husband had separate estates.\nMme. de Lamotte said that she would not have time to wait until the\npower of attorney was ready, and therefore asked M. Pourra to send it\nto the parish priest at Villeneuvele-Roi; this he promised to do. Mme.\nde-Lamotte had called twice during the day at the Hotel Blanc and asked\nfor M. Desportes of Paris, but he was not at home. While Derues, alias\nDesportes, alias Mme. de Lamotte, was masquerading in Lyons, events had\nbeen moving swiftly and unfavourably in Paris. Sick with misgiving and\nanxiety, M. de Lamotte had come there to find, if possible, his wife and\nchild. By a strange coincidence he alighted at an inn in the Rue de la\nMortellerie, only a few yards from the wine-cellar in which the corpse\nof his ill-fated wife lay buried. He lost no time in putting his case\nbefore the Lieutenant of Police, who placed the affair in the hands\nof one of the magistrates of the Chatelet, then the criminal court of\nParis. At first the magistrate believed that the case was one of fraud\nand that Mme. de Lamotte and her son were being kept somewhere in\nconcealment by Derues. But as he investigated the circumstances further,\nthe evidence of the illness of the mother and son, the date of the\ndisappearance of Mme. de Lamotte, and her reputed signature to the deed\nof sale on February 12, led him to suspect that he was dealing with a\ncase of murder.\n\nWhen Derues returned to Paris from Lyons, on March 11, he found that the\npolice had already visited the house and questioned his wife, and\nthat he himself was under close surveillance. A day or two later the\nadvocate, Duclos, revealed to the magistrate the fictitious character\nof the loan of 100,000 livres, which Derues alleged that he had paid\nto Mme. de Lamotte as the price of Buisson-Souef. When the new power of\nattorney purporting to be signed by Mme. de Lamotte arrived from\nLyons, and the signature was compared with that on the deed of sale of\nBuisson-Souef to Derues, both were pronounced to be forgeries. Derues\nwas arrested and lodged in the Prison of For l'Eveque.\n\nThe approach of danger had not dashed the spirits of the little man, nor\nwas he without partisans in Paris. Opinion in the city was divided as\nto the truth of his account of Mme. de Lamotte's elopement. The nobility\nwere on the side of the injured de Lamotte, but the bourgeoisie\naccepted the grocer's story and made merry over the deceived husband.\nInterrogated, however, by the magistrate of the Chatelet, Derues'\nposition became more difficult. Under the stress of close questioning\nthe flimsy fabric of his financial statements fell to pieces like a\nhouse of cards. He had to admit that he had never paid Mme. de Lamotte\n100,000 livres; he had paid her only 25,000 livres in gold; further\npressed he said that the 25,000 livres had been made up partly in gold,\npartly in bills; but where the gold had come from, or on whom he had\ndrawn the bills, he could not explain. Still his position was not\ndesperate; and he knew it. In the absence of Mme. de Lamotte he could\nnot be charged with fraud or forgery; and until her body was discovered,\nit would be impossible to charge him with murder.\n\nA month passed; Mme. Derues, who had made a belated attempt to follow\nher husband's example by impersonating Mme. de Lamotte in Paris, had\nbeen arrested and imprisoned in the Grand Chatelet; when, on April 18,\ninformation was received by the authorities which determined them to\nexplore the wine-cellar in the Rue de la Mortellerie. Whether the woman\nwho had let the cellar to Derues, or the creditor who had met him taking\nhis cask of wine there, had informed the investigating magistrate, seems\nuncertain. In any case, the corpse of the unhappy lady was soon brought\nto light and Derues confronted with it. At first he said that he failed\nto recognise it as the remains of Mme. de Lamotte, but he soon abandoned\nthat rather impossible attitude. He admitted that he had given some\nharmless medicine to Mme. de Lamotte during her illness, and then, to\nhis horror, one morning had awakened to find her dead. A fear lest\nher husband would accuse him of having caused her death had led him to\nconceal the body, and also that of her son who, he now confessed, had\ndied and been buried by him at Versailles. On April 23 the body of the\nyoung de Lamotte was exhumed. Both bodies were examined by doctors, and\nthey declared themselves satisfied that mother and son had died \"from\na bitter and corrosive poison administered in some kind of drink.\" What\nthe poison was they did not venture to state, but one of their number,\nin the light of subsequent investigation, arrived at the conclusion that\nDerues had used in both cases corrosive sublimate. How or where he had\nobtained the poison was never discovered.\n\nJustice moved swiftly in Paris in those days. The preliminary\ninvestigation in Derues' case was ended on April 28. Two days later his\ntrial commenced before the tribunal of the Chatelet.\n\nIt lasted one day. The judges had before them the depositions taken by\nthe examining magistrate. Both Derues and his wife were interrogated. He\nmaintained that he had not poisoned either Mme. de Lamotte or her son;\nhis only crime, he said, lay in having concealed their deaths. Mme;\nDerues said: \"It is Buisson-Souef that has ruined us! I always told my\nhusband that he was mad to buy these properties--I am sure my husband is\nnot a poisoner--I trusted my husband and believed every word he said.\"\nThe court condemned Derues to death, but deferred judgment in his wife's\ncase on the ground of her pregnancy.\n\nAnd now the frail, cat-like little man had to brace himself to meet\na cruel and protracted execution. But sanguine to the last, he still\nhoped. An appeal lay from the Chatelet to the Parliament of Paris. It\nwas heard on March 5. Derues was brought to the Palais de Justice.\nThe room in which he waited was filled with curious spectators, who\nmarvelled at his coolness and impudence. He recognised among them a\nBenedictine monk of his acquaintance. \"My case,\" he called out to him,\n\"will soon be over; we'll meet again yet and have a good time together.\"\nOne visitor, wishing not to appear too curious, pretended to be looking\nat a picture. \"Come, sir,\" said Derues, \"you haven't come here to see\nthe pictures, but to see me. Have a good look at me. Why study copies of\nnature when you can look at such a remarkable original as I?\" But there\nwere to be no more days of mirth and gaiety for the jesting grocer. His\nappeal was rejected, and he was ordered for execution on the morrow.\n\nAt six o'clock on the morning of May 6 Derues returned to the Palais\nde Justice, there to submit to the superfluous torments of the question\nordinary and extraordinary. Though condemned to death, torture was to\nbe applied in the hope of wringing from the prisoner some sort of\nconfession. The doctors declared him too delicate to undergo the torture\nof pouring cold water into him, which his illustrious predecessor, Mme.\nde Brinvilliers, had suffered; he was to endure the less severe torture\nof the \"boot.\"\n\nHis legs were tightly encased in wood, and wedges were then hammered in\nuntil the flesh was crushed and the bones broken. But never a word\nof confession was wrung from the suffering creature. Four wedges\nconstituting the ordinary torture he endured; at the third of the\nextraordinary he fainted away. Put in the front of a fire the warmth\nrestored him. Again he was questioned, again he asserted his wife's\ninnocence and his own.\n\nAt two o'clock in the afternoon Derues was recovered sufficiently to be\ntaken to Notre Dame. There, in front of the Cathedral, candle in hand\nand rope round his neck, he made the amende honorable. But as the\nsentence was read aloud to the people Derues reiterated the assertion\nof his innocence. From Notre Dame he was taken to the Hotel de Ville.\nA condemned man had the right to stop there on his way to execution,\nto make his will and last dying declarations. Derues availed himself\nof this opportunity to protest solemnly and emphatically his wife's\nabsolute innocence of any complicity in whatever he had done. \"I want\nabove all,\" he said, \"to state that my wife is entirely innocent. She\nknew nothing. I used fifty cunning devices to hide everything from her.\nI am speaking nothing but the truth, she is wholly innocent--as for me,\nI am about to die.\" His wife was allowed to see him; he enjoined her to\nbring up their children in the fear of God and love of duty, and to let\nthem know how he had died. Once again, as he took up the pen to sign the\nrecord of his last words, he re-asserted her innocence.\n\nOf the last dreadful punishment the offending grocer was to be spared\nnothing. For an aristocrat like Mme. de Brinvilliers beheading was\nconsidered indignity enough. But Derues must go through with it all; he\nmust be broken on the wheel and burnt alive and his ashes scattered to\nthe four winds of heaven; there was to be no retentum for him, a\nclause sometimes inserted in the sentence permitting the executioner to\nstrangle the broken victim before casting him on to the fire. He must\nendure all to the utmost agony the law could inflict. It was six o'clock\nwhen Derues arrived at the Place de Greve, crowded to its capacity, the\nsquare itself, the windows of the houses; places had been bought at high\nprices, stools, ladders, anything that would give a good view of the end\nof the now famous poisoner.\n\nPale but calm, Derues faced his audience. He was stripped of all but his\nshirt; lying flat on the scaffold, his face looking up to the sky, his\nhead resting on a stone, his limbs were fastened to the wheel. Then with\na heavy bar of iron the executioner broke them one after another, and\neach time he struck a fearful cry came from the culprit. The customary\nthree final blows on the stomach were inflicted, but still the little\nman lived. Alive and broken, he was thrown on to the fire. His burnt\nashes, scattered to the winds, were picked up eagerly by the mob,\nreputed, as in England the pieces of the hangman's rope, talismans.\n\nSome two months after the execution of her husband Mme. Derues was\ndelivered in the Conciergerie of a male child; it is hardly surprising,\nin face of her experiences during her pregnancy, that it was born an\nidiot. In January, 1778, the judges of the Parliament, by a majority of\none, decided that she should remain a prisoner in the Conciergerie for\nanother year, while judgment in her case was reserved. In the following\nAugust she was charged with having forged the signature of Mme. de\nLamotte on the deeds of sale. In February, 1779, the two experts in\nhandwriting to whom the question had been submitted decided in her\nfavour, and the charge was abandoned.\n\nBut Mme. Derues had a far sterner, more implacable and, be it added,\nmore unscrupulous adversary than the law in M. de Lamotte.\n\nNot content with her husband's death, M. de Lamotte believed the wife to\nhave been his partner in guilt, and thirsted for revenge.\n\nTo accomplish it he even stooped to suborn witnesses, but the conspiracy\nwas exposed, and so strong became the sympathy with the accused woman\nthat a young proctor of the Parliament published a pamphlet in her\ndefence, asking for an immediate inquiry into the charges made against\nher, charges that had in no instance been proved.\n\nAt last, in March, 1779, the Parliament decided to finish with the\naffair. In secret session the judges met, examined once more all the\ndocuments in the case, listened to a report on it from one of their\nnumber, interrogated the now weary, hopeless prisoner, and, by a large\nmajority, condemned her to a punishment that fell only just short of\nthe supreme penalty. On the grounds that she had wilfully and knowingly\nparticipated with her husband in the fraudulent attempt to become\npossessed of the estate of Buisson-Souef, and was strongly suspected of\nhaving participated with him in his greater crime, she was sentenced\nto be publicly flogged, branded on both shoulders with the letter V\n(Voleuse) and imprisoned for life in the Salpetriere Prison. On March\n13, in front of the Conciergerie Mme. Derues underwent the first part of\nher punishment. The same day her hair was cut short, and she was dressed\nin the uniform of the prison in which she was to pass the remainder of\nher days.\n\nParis had just begun to forget Mme. Derues when a temporary interest\nwas-excited in her fortunes by the astonishing intelligence that, two\nmonths after her condemnation, she had been delivered of a child in her\nnew prison. Its fatherhood was never determined, and, taken from her\nmother, the child died in fifteen days. Was its birth the result of some\npassing love affair, or some act of drunken violence on the part of her\njailors, or had the wretched woman, fearing a sentence of death, made an\neffort to avert once again the supreme penalty? History does not relate.\n\nTen years passed. A fellow prisoner in the Salpetriere described Mme.\nDerues as \"scheming, malicious, capable of anything.\" She was accused\nof being violent, and of wishing to revenge herself by setting fire to\nParis. At length the Revolution broke on France, the Bastille fell, and\nin that same year an old uncle of Mme. Derues, an ex-soldier of\nLouis XV., living in Brittany, petitioned for his niece's release. He\nprotested her innocence, and begged that he might take her to his home\nand restore her to her children. For three years he persisted vainly in\nhis efforts. At last, in the year 1792, it seemed as if they might be\ncrowned with success. He was told that the case would be re-examined;\nthat it was possible that the Parliament had judged unjustly. This good\nnews came to him in March. But in September of that year there took\nplace those shocking massacres in the Paris prisons, which rank high\namong the atrocities of the Revolution. At four o'clock on the afternoon\nof September 4, the slaughterers visited the Salpetriere Prison, and\nfifth among their victims fell the widow of Derues.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Castaing\n\n\nThere are two reports of the trial of Castaing: \"Proces Complet d'Edme\nSamuel Castaing,\" Paris, 1823; \"Affaire Castaing,\" Paris, 1823.\n\nI\n\nAN UNHAPPY COINCIDENCE\n\nEdme Castaing, born at Alencon in 1796, was the youngest of the three\nsons of an Inspector-General in the department of Woods and Forests.\nHis elder brother had entered the same service as his father, the other\nbrother was a staff-captain of engineers. Without being wealthy, the\nfamily, consisting of M. and Mme. Castaing and four children, was in\ncomfortable circumstances. The young Edme was educated at the College of\nAngers--the Alma Mater of Barre and Lebiez--where, intelligent and hard\nworking, he carried off many prizes. He decided to enter the medical\nprofession, and at the age of nineteen commenced his studies at the\nSchool of Medicine in Paris. For two years he worked hard and well,\nliving within the modest allowance made him by his father. At the end of\nthat time this young man of two or three-and-twenty formed a passionate\nattachment for a lady, the widow of a judge, and the mother of three\nchildren. Of the genuine depth and sincerity of this passion for a woman\nwho must have been considerably older than himself, there can be no\ndoubt. Henceforth the one object in life to Castaing was to make money\nenough to relieve the comparative poverty of his adored mistress, and\nplace her and her children beyond the reach of want. In 1821 Castaing\nbecame a duly qualified doctor, and by that time had added to the\nresponsibilities of his mistress and himself by becoming the father of\ntwo children, whom she had brought into the world. The lady was exigent,\nand Castaing found it difficult to combine his work with a due regard to\nher claims on his society. Nor was work plentiful or lucrative. To add\nto his embarrassments Castaing, in 1818, had backed a bill for a\nfriend for 600 francs. To meet it when it fell due two years later was\nimpossible, and desperate were the efforts made by Castaing and his\nmother to put off the day of reckoning. His father, displeased with his\nson's conduct, would do nothing to help him. But his mother spared\nno effort to extricate him from his difficulties. She begged a highly\nplaced official to plead with the insistent creditor, but all in vain.\nThere seemed no hope of a further delay when suddenly, in the October\nof 1822, Castaing became the possessor of 100,000 francs. How he became\npossessed of this considerable sum of money forms part of a strange and\nmysterious story.\n\nAmong the friends of Castaing were two young men of about his own age,\nAuguste and Hippolyte Ballet. Auguste, the elder, had the misfortune\na few days after his birth to incur his mother's lasting dislike. The\nnurse had let the child fall from her arms in the mother's presence, and\nthe shock had endangered Mme. Ballet's life. From that moment the\nmother took a strong aversion to her son; he was left to the charge of\nservants; his meals were taken in the kitchen. As soon as he was five\nyears old he was put out to board elsewhere, while his brother Hippolyte\nand his sister were well cared for at home. The effect of this unjust\nneglect on the character of Auguste Ballet was, as may be imagined, had;\nhe became indolent and dissipated. His brother Hippolyte, on the other\nhand, had justified the affectionate care bestowed on his upbringing; he\nhad grown into a studious, intelligent youth of a refined and attractive\ntemperament. Unhappily, early in his life he had developed consumption,\na disease he inherited from his mother. As he grew older his health grew\nsteadily worse until, in 1822, his friends were seriously alarmed at his\ncondition. It became so much graver that, in the August of that year,\nthe doctors recommended him to take the waters at Enghien. In September\nhe returned to Paris apparently much better, but on October 2 he was\nseized with sudden illness, and three days later he was dead.\n\nA few years before the death of Hippolyte his father and mother had\ndied almost at the same time. M. Ballet had left to each of his sons a\nfortune of some 260,000 francs. Though called to the bar, both Auguste\nand Hippolyte Ballet were now men of independent means. After the death\nof their parents, whatever jealousy Auguste may have felt at the unfair\npreference which his mother had shown for her younger son, had died\ndown. At the time of Hippolyte's death the brothers were on good terms,\nthough the more prudent Hippolyte disapproved of his elder brother's\nextravagance.\n\nOf Hippolyte Ballet Dr. Castaing had become the fast friend. Apart\nfrom his personal liking for Castaing, it was a source of comfort to\nHippolyte, in his critical state of health, to have as his friend one\nwhose medical knowledge was always at his service.\n\nAbout the middle of August, 1822, Hippolyte, on the advice of his\ndoctors, went to Enghien to take the waters. There Castaing paid him\nfrequent visits. He returned to Paris on September 22, and seemed to\nhave benefited greatly by the cure. On Tuesday, October 1, he saw his\nsister, Mme. Martignon, and her husband; he seemed well, but said that\nhe was having leeches applied to him by his friend Castaing. On the\nWednesday evening his sister saw him again, and found him well and with\na good appetite. On the Thursday, after a night disturbed by severe\nattacks of vomiting, his condition seemed serious. His brother-in-law,\nwho visited him, found that he had taken to his bed, his face was\nswollen, his eyes were red. His sister called in the evening, but could\nnot see him. The servants told her that her brother was a little better\nbut resting, and that he did not wish to be disturbed; they said that\nDr. Castaing had been with him all day.\n\nOn Friday Castaing himself called on the Martignons, and told them that\nHippolyte had passed a shockingly bad night. Madame Martignon insisted\non going to nurse her brother herself, but Castaing refused positively\nto let her see him; the sight of her, he said, would be too agitating\nto the patient. Later in the day Mme. Martignon went to her brother's\nhouse. In order to obey Dr. Castaing's injunctions, she dressed herself\nin some of the clothes of the servant Victoire, in the hope that if she\nwent into his bedroom thus disguised, Hippolyte would not recognise her.\nBut even this subterfuge was forbidden by Castaing, and Mme. Martignon\nhad to content herself with listening in an adjoining room for the sound\nof her brother's voice. At eight o'clock that evening the Martignons\nlearnt that Hippolyte was better, but at ten o'clock they received a\nmessage that he was dying, and that his brother Auguste had been sent\nfor. Mme. Martignon was prostrated with grief, but her husband hastened\nto his brother-in-law's house. There he found Castaing, who said that\nthe death agony of his friend was so dreadful that he had not the\nstrength to remain in the room with the dying man. Another doctor was\nsent for, but at ten o'clock the following morning, after protracted\nsuffering, Hippolyte Ballet passed away.\n\nA post-mortem was held on his body. It was made by Drs. Segalas and\nCastaing. They stated that death was due to pleurisy aggravated by the\nconsumptive condition of the deceased, which, however serious, was not\nof itself likely to have been so rapidly fatal in its consequences.\n\nHippolyte had died, leaving a fortune of some 240,000 francs. In the\nprevious September he had spoken to the notary Lebret, a former clerk\nof his father's, of his intention of making a will. He had seen that his\nbrother Auguste was squandering his share of their inheritance; he told\nLebret that whatever he might leave to Auguste should not be placed at\nhis absolute disposal. To his servant Victoire, during his last illness,\nHippolyte had spoken of a will he had made which he wished to destroy.\nIf Hippolyte had made such a will, did he destroy it before his death?\nIn any case, no trace of it was ever found after his death. He\nwas presumed to have died intestate, and his fortune was divided,\nthree-quarters of it going to his brother Auguste, the remaining quarter\nto his sister, Mme. Martignon.\n\nOn the day of Hippolyte's death Auguste Ballet wrote from his brother's\nhouse to one Prignon: \"With great grief I have to tell you that I have\njust lost my brother; I write at the same time to say that I must have\n100,000 francs to-day if possible. I have the greatest need of it.\nDestroy my letter, and reply at once. M. Sandrie will, I am sure,\naccommodate me. I am at my poor brother's house, from which I am\nwriting.\" Prignon did as he was asked, but it was two days before the\nstockbroker, Sandrie, could raise the necessary sum. On October 7 he\nsold out sufficient of Auguste's stock to realise 100,000 francs, and\nthe following day gave Prignon an order on the Bank of France for that\namount. The same day Prignon took the order to Auguste. Accompanied by\nCastaing and Jean, Auguste's black servant, Auguste and Prignon drove to\nthe bank. There the order was cashed. Prignon's part of the business was\nat an end. He said good-bye to Auguste outside the bank. As the latter\ngot into his cabriolet, carrying the bundle of notes, Prignon heard him\nsay to Castaing: \"There are the 100,000 francs.\"\n\nWhy had Auguste Ballet, after his brother's death, such urgent need of\n100,000 francs? If the statements of Auguste made to other persons\nare to be believed, he had paid the 100,000 francs which he had raised\nthrough Prignon to Lebret, his father's former clerk, who would seem to\nhave acted as legal and financial adviser to his old master's children.\nAccording to Auguste's story, his sister, Mme. Martignon, had offered\nLebret 80,000 francs to preserve a copy of a will made by Hippolyte,\nleaving her the bulk of his fortune. Castaing, however, had ascertained\nthat Lebret would be willing, if Auguste would outbid his sister and pay\n100,000 francs, to destroy the will so that, Hippolyte dying intestate,\nAuguste would take the greater part of his brother's fortune. Auguste\nagreed to accept Lebret's terms, raised the necessary sum, and handed\nover the money to Castaing, who, in turn, gave it to Lebret, who had\nthereupon destroyed the copy of the will. Castaing, according to the\nevidence of Auguste's mistress, an actress of the name of Percillie,\nhad spoken in her presence of having himself destroyed one copy of\nHippolyte's will before his death, and admitted having arranged with\nLebret after Hippolyte's death for the destruction of the other copy.\n\nHow far was the story told by Auguste, and repeated in somewhat\ndifferent shape by Castaing to other persons, true? There is no doubt\nthat after the visit to the Bank of France with Prignon on October\n8, Auguste and Castaing drove together to Lebret's office. The negro\nservant said that on arriving there one of them got out of the cab and\nwent up to Lebret's house, but which of the two he would not at first\nsay positively. Later he swore that it was Auguste Ballet. Whatever\nhappened on that visit to Lebret's--and it was the theory of the\nprosecution that Castaing and not Auguste had gone up to the office--the\nsame afternoon Auguste Ballet showed his mistress the seals of the copy\nof his brother's will which Lebret had destroyed, and told her that\nLebret, all through the business, had refused to deal directly with him,\nand would only act through the intermediary of Castaing.\n\nDid Lebret, as a fact, receive the 100,000 francs? A close examination\nof his finances showed no trace of such a sum. Castaing, on the other\nhand, on October 10, 1822, had given a stockbroker a sum of 66,000\nfrancs to invest in securities; on the 11th of the same month he had\nlent his mother 30,000 francs; and on the 14th had given his mistress\n4,000 francs. Of how this large sum of money had come to Castaing at\na time when he was practically insolvent he gave various accounts.\nHis final version was that in the will destroyed by Auguste, Hippolyte\nBallet had left him an income for life equivalent to a capital of\n100,000 francs, and that Auguste had given him that sum out of respect\nfor his brother's wishes. If that explanation were true, it was\ncertainly strange that shortly after his brother's death Auguste Ballet\nshould have expressed surprise and suspicion to a friend on hearing that\nCastaing had been buying stock to the value of 8,000 francs. If he had\ngiven Castaing 100,000 francs for himself, there was no occasion for\nsurprise or suspicion at his investing 8,000. That Auguste had paid out\n100,000 francs to some one in October the state of his finances at\nhis death clearly proved. According to the theory of the prosecution,\nAuguste believed that he had paid that money to Lebret through the\nintermediary of Castaing, and not to Castaing himself. Hence his\nsurprise at hearing that Castaing, whom he knew to be impecunious, was\ninvesting such a sum as 8,000 francs.\n\nNo money had ever reached Lebret. His honesty and good faith were\ndemonstrated beyond any shadow of a doubt; no copy of any will of\nHippolyte Ballet had ever been in his possession. But Castaing had shown\nAuguste Ballet a copy of his brother's will, the seals of which Auguste\nhad shown to his mistress. In all probability, and possibly at the\ninstigation of Castaing, Hippolyte Ballet had made a will, leaving the\ngreater part of his property to his sister. Somehow or other Castaing\nhad got possession of this will. On his death Castaing had invented the\nstory of Mme. Martignon's bribe to Lebret, and so persuaded Auguste\nto outbid her. He had ingeniously kept Auguste and Lebret apart by\nrepresenting Lebret as refusing to deal direct with Auguste, and by\nthese means had secured to his own use the sum of 100,000 francs, which\nAuguste believed was being paid to Lebret as the price of his\nalleged destruction of his brother's will. The plot was ingenious and\nsuccessful. To Lebret and the Martignons Castaing said that Hippolyte\nhad made a will in Mme. Martignon's favour, but had destroyed it himself\nsome days before his death. The Martignons expressed themselves as glad\nthat Hippolyte had done so, for they feared lest such a will should\nhave provoked resentment against them on the part of Auguste. By keeping\nAuguste and Lebret apart, Castaing prevented awkward explanations. The\nonly possible danger of discovery lay in Auguste's incautious admissions\nto his mistress and friends; but even had the fact of the destruction\nof the will come to the ears of the Martignons, it is unlikely that they\nwould have taken any steps involving the disgrace of Auguste.\n\nCastaing had enriched himself considerably by the opportune death of his\nfriend Hippolyte. It might be made a matter of unfriendly comment that,\non the first day of May preceding that sad event, Castaing had purchased\nten grains of acetate of morphia from a chemist in Paris, and on\nSeptember 18, less than a month before Hippolyte's death, he had\npurchased another ten grains of acetate of morphia from the same\nchemist. The subject of poisons had always been a favourite branch of\nCastaing's medical studies, especially vegetable poisons; morphia is a\nvegetable poison.\n\nCastaing's position relative to Auguste Ballet was now a strong one.\nThey were accomplices in the unlawful destruction of Hippolyte's will.\nAuguste believed it to be in his friend's power to ruin him at any time\nby revealing his dealings with Lebret. But, more than that, to Auguste,\nwho believed that his 100,000 francs had gone into Lebret's pocket,\nCastaing could represent himself as so far unrewarded for his share in\nthe business; Lebret had taken all the money, while he had received no\nrecompense of any kind for the trouble he had taken and the risk he was\nencountering on his friend's behalf. Whatever the motive, from fear or\ngratitude, Auguste Ballet was persuaded to make a will leaving Dr. Edme\nSamuel Castaing the whole of his fortune, subject to a few trifling\nlegacies. But Auguste's feelings towards his sole legatee were no longer\ncordial. To one or two of his friends he expressed his growing distaste\nfor Castaing's society.\n\nDr. Castaing can hardly have failed to observe this change. He knew\nAuguste to be reckless and extravagant with his money; he learnt that he\nhad realised another 100,000 francs out of his securities, and that he\nkept the money locked up in a drawer in his desk. If Auguste's fortune\nwere dissipated by extravagance, or he revoked his will, Castaing stood\nto lose heavily. As time went on Castaing felt less and less sure that\nhe could place much reliance on the favourable disposition or thrift of\nAuguste. The latter had fallen in love with a new mistress; he began to\nentertain expensively; even if he should not change his mind and leave\nhis money away from Castaing, there might very soon be no money to\nleave. At the end of May, 1823, Castaing consulted a cousin of his,\nMalassis, a notary's clerk, as to the validity of a will made by a sick\nman in favour of his medical attendant. He said that he had a patient\ngravely ill who, not wishing to leave his money to his sister, whom he\ndisliked, intended to leave it to him. Malassis reassured him as to the\nvalidity of such a will, and gave him the necessary instructions for\npreparing it. On May 29 Castaing sent Malassis the will of Auguste\nBallet with the following note, \"I send you the will of M. Ballets\nexamine it and keep it as his representative.\" The will was dated\nDecember 1, 1822, and made Castaing sole legatee. On the same day\nthat the will was deposited with Malassis, Castaing and Auguste Ballet\nstarted to-gether on a little two days' trip into the country. To his\nfriends Auguste seemed in the best of health and spirits; so much so\nthat his housekeeper remarked as he left how well he was looking, and\nCastaing echoed her remark, saying that he looked like a prince!\n\nDuring the afternoon the two friends visited Saint Germain, then\nreturned to Paris, and at seven o'clock in the evening arrived at the\nTete Noire Hotel at Saint Cloud, where they took a double-bedded room,\nCastaing paying five francs in advance. They spent the following day,\nFriday, May 30, in walking about the neighbourhood, dined at the hotel\nat seven, went out again and returned about nine o'clock. Soon after\ntheir return Castaing ordered some warmed wine to be sent up to the\nbedroom. It was taken up by one of the maid-servants. Two glasses were\nmixed with lemon and sugar which Castaing had brought with him. Both the\nyoung men drank of the beverage. Auguste complained that it was sour,\nand thought that he had put too much lemon in it. He gave his glass to\nthe servant to taste, who also found the drink sour. Shortly after\nshe left the room and went upstairs to the bedside of one of her\nfellow-servants who was ill. Castaing, for no apparent reason, followed\nher up and stayed in the room for about five minutes. Auguste spent a\nbad night, suffering from internal pains, and in the morning his legs\nwere so swollen that he could not put on his boots.\n\nCastaing got up at four o'clock that morning and asked one of the\nservants to let him out. Two hours later he drove up in a cabriolet to\nthe door of a chemist in Paris, and asked for twelve grains of tartar\nemetic, which he wanted to mix in a wash according to a prescription of\nDr. Castaing. But he did not tell the chemist that he was Dr. Castaing\nhimself. An hour later Castaing arrived at the shop of another chemist,\nChevalier, with whom he had already some acquaintance; he had bought\nacetate of morphia from him some months before, and had discussed with\nhim then the effects of vegetable poisons. On this particular morning he\nbought of his assistant thirty-six grains of acetate of morphia, paying,\nas a medical man, three francs fifty centimes for it instead of the\nusual price of four francs. Later in the morning Castaing returned to\nSaint Cloud, a distance of ten miles from Paris, and said that he had\nbeen out for a long walk. He found Auguste ill in bed. Castaing asked\nfor some cold milk, which was taken up to the bedroom by one of the\nservants. Shortly after this Castaing went out again. During his absence\nAuguste was seized with violent pains and sickness. When Castaing\nreturned he found his friend in the care of the people of the hotel. He\ntold them to throw away the matter that had been vomited, as the smell\nwas offensive, and Auguste told them to do as his friend directed.\nCastaing proposed to send for a doctor from Paris, but Auguste insisted\nthat a local doctor should be called in at once.\n\nAccordingly Dr. Pigache of Saint Cloud was summoned. He arrived at the\nhotel about eleven o'clock. Before seeing the patient Castaing told the\ndoctor that he believed him to be suffering from cholera. Pigache asked\nto see the matter vomited but was told that it had been thrown away. He\nprescribed a careful diet, lemonade and a soothing draught.\n\nDr. Pigache returned at three o'clock, when he found that the patient\nhad taken some lemonade, but, according to Castaing, had refused to take\nthe draught. He called again that afternoon. Ballet was much better;\nhe said that he would be quite well if he could get some sleep, and\nexpressed a wish to return to Paris. Dr. Pigache dissuaded him from this\nand left, saying that he would come again in the evening. Castaing said\nthat that would be unnecessary, and it was agreed that Pigache should\nsee the patient again at eight o'clock the next morning. During the\nafternoon Castaing sent a letter to Paris to Jean, Auguste's negro\nservant, telling him to take the two keys of his master's desk to his\ncousin Malassis. But the negro distrusted Castaing. He knew of the will\nwhich his master had made in the doctor's favour. Rather than compromise\nhimself by any injudicious act, he brought the keys to Saint Cloud and\nthere handed them over to Castaing.\n\nWhen Jean arrived his master complained to him of feeling very ill.\nJean said that he hoped he would be well enough to go back to Paris the\nfollowing day, to which Auguste replied, \"I don't think so. But if I am\nlucky enough to get away to-morrow, I shall leave fifty francs for\nthe poor here.\" About eleven o'clock that night Castaing, in Jean's\npresence, gave the sick man a spoonful of the draught prescribed by Dr.\nPigache. Four or five minutes later Auguste was seized with terrible\nconvulsions, followed by unconsciousness. Dr. Pigache was sent for. He\nfound Ballet lying on his back unconscious, his throat strained, his\nmouth shut and his eyes fixed; the pulse was weak, his body covered\nwith cold sweat; and every now and then he was seized with strong\nconvulsions. The doctor asked Castaing the cause of the sudden change in\nBallet's condition. Castaing replied that it had commenced shortly after\nhe had taken a spoonful of the draught which the doctor had prescribed\nfor him. Dr. Pigache bled the patient and applied twenty leeches. He\nreturned about six; Ballet was sinking, and Castaing appeared to be\ngreatly upset. He told the doctor what an unhappy coincidence it was\nthat he should have been present at the deathbeds of both Hippolyte and\nhis brother Auguste; and that the position was the more distressing\nfor him as he was the sole heir to Auguste's fortune. To M. Pelletan, a\nprofessor of medicine, who had been sent for to St. Cloud in the early\nhours of Sunday morning, Castaing appeared to be in a state of great\ngrief and agitation; he was shedding tears. Pelletan was from the first\nimpressed by the suspicious nature of the case, and pointed out to\nCastaing the awkwardness of his situation as heir to the dying man.\n\"You're right,\" replied Castaing, \"my position is dreadful, horrible. In\nmy great grief I had never thought of it till now, but now you make me\nsee it clearly. Do you think there will be an investigation?\" Pelletan\nanswered that he should be compelled to ask for a post-mortem. \"Ah! You\nwill be doing me the greatest service,\" said Castaing, \"I beg you to\ninsist on a post-mortem. You will be acting as a second father to me in\ndoing so.\" The parish priest was sent for to administer extreme unction\nto the dying man. To the parish clerk who accompanied the priest\nCastaing said, \"I am losing a friend of my childhood,\" and both priest\nand clerk went away greatly edified by the sincere sorrow and pious\ndemeanour of the young doctor. About mid-day on Sunday, June 1, Auguste\nBallet died.\n\nDuring the afternoon Castaing left the hotel for some hours, and that\nsame afternoon a young man about twenty-five years of age, short and\nfair, left a letter at the house of Malassis. The letter was from\nCastaing and said, \"My dear friend, Ballet has just died, but do nothing\nbefore to-morrow, Monday. I will see you and tell you, yes or no,\nwhether it is time to act. I expect that his brother-in-law, M.\nMartignon, whose face is pock-marked and who carries a decoration, will\ncall and see you. I have said that I did not know what dispositions\nBallet may have made, but that before his death he had told me to give\nyou two little keys which I am going to deliver to you myself to-morrow,\nMonday. I have not said that we are cousins, but only that I had seen\nyou once or twice at Ballet's, with whom you were friendly. So say\nnothing till I have seen you, but whatever you do, don't say you are\na relative of mine.\" When he returned to the hotel Castaing found\nMartignon, Lebret, and one or two friends of Auguste already assembled.\nIt was only that morning that Martignon had received from Castaing any\nintimation of his brother-in-law's critical condition. From the first\nCastaing was regarded with suspicion; the nature of the illness, the\nsecrecy maintained about it by Castaing, the coincidence of some of\nthe circumstances with those of the death of Hippolyte, all combined to\nexcite suspicion. Asked if Auguste had left a will Castaing said no;\nbut the next day he admitted its existence, and said that it was in the\nhands of Malassis.\n\nMonday, June 2, was the day fixed for the post-mortem; it was performed\nin the hotel at Saint Cloud. Castaing was still in the hotel under\nprovisional arrest. While the post-mortem was going on his agitation was\nextreme; he kept opening the door of the room in which he was confined,\nto hear if possible some news of the result. At last M. Pelletan\nobtained permission to inform him of the verdict of the doctors. It was\nfavourable to Castaing; no trace of death by violence or poison had been\ndiscovered.\n\nThe medical men declared death to be due to an inflammation of\nthe stomach, which could be attributed to natural causes; that the\ninflammation had subsided; that it had been succeeded by cerebral\ninflammation, which frequently follows inflammation of the stomach,\nand may have been aggravated in this case by exposure to the sun or by\nover-indulgence of any kind.\n\n\nII\n\nTHE TRIAL OF DR. CASTAING\n\n\nCastaing expected, as a result of the doctors' report, immediate\nrelease. In this he was disappointed; he was placed under stricter\narrest and taken to Paris, where a preliminary investigation commenced,\nlasting five months. During the early part of his imprisonment Castaing\nfeigned insanity, going to disgusting lengths in the hope of convincing\nthose about him of the reality of his madness. But after three days of\nfutile effort he gave up the attempt, and turned his attention to more\npractical means of defence. In the prison at Versailles, whither he had\nbeen removed from Paris, he got on friendly terms with a prisoner, one\nGoupil, who was awaiting trial for some unimportant offence. To Goupil\nCastaing described the cruelty of his position and the causes that had\nled to his wrongful arrest. He admitted his unfortunate possession of\nthe poison, and said that the 100,000 francs which he had invested\nhe had inherited from an uncle. Through Goupil he succeeded in\ncommunicating with his mother in the hope that she would use her\ninfluence to stifle some of the more serious evidence against him.\nThrough other prisoners he tried to get at the chemists from whom he had\nbought acetate of morphia, and persuade them to say that the preparation\nof morphia which he had purchased was harmless.\n\nThe trial of Castaing commenced before the Paris Assize Court on\nNovember 10, 1823. He was charged with the murder of Hippolyte Ballet,\nthe destruction of a document containing the final dispositions of\nHippolyte's property, and with the murder of Auguste Ballet. The three\ncharges were to be tried simultaneously. The Act of Accusation\nin Castaing's case is a remarkable document, covering a hundred\nclosely-printed pages. It is a well-reasoned, graphic and unfair\nstatement of the case for the prosecution. It tells the whole story\nof the crime, and inserts everything that can possibly prejudice the\nprisoner in the eyes of the jury. As an example, it quotes against\nCastaing a letter of his mistress in which, in the course of some\nquarrel, she had written to him saying that his mother had said some\n\"horrible things\" (des horreurs) of him; but what those \"horrible\nthings\" were was not revealed, nor were they ever alluded to again\nin the course of the trial, nor was his mistress called as a witness,\nthough payments of money by Castaing to her formed an important part\nof the evidence against him. Again, the evidence of Goupil, his fellow\nprisoner, as to the incriminating statements made to him by Castaing is\ngiven in the Act of Accusation, but Goupil himself was not called at the\ntrial.\n\nDuring the reading of the Act of Accusation by the Clerk of the Court\nCastaing listened calmly. Only when some allusion was made to his\nmistress and their children did he betray any sign of emotion. As soon\nas the actual facts of the case were set out he was all attention,\nmaking notes busily. He is described as rather attractive in appearance,\nhis face long, his features regular, his forehead high, his hair,\nfair in colour, brushed back from the brows; he wore rather large\nside-whiskers. One of the witnesses at Saint Cloud said that Castaing\nlooked more like a priest than a doctor; his downcast eyes, gentle\nvoice, quiet and unassuming demeanour, lent him an air of patience and\nhumility.\n\nThe interrogatory of Castaing by the presiding judge lasted all the\nafternoon of the first day of the trial and the morning of the second.\nThe opening part of it dealt with the murder of Hippolyte Ballet,\nand elicited little or nothing that was fresh. Beyond the purchase\nof acetate of morphia previous to Hippolyte's death, which Castaing\nreluctantly admitted, there was no serious evidence against him, and\nbefore the end of the trial the prosecution abandoned that part of the\ncharge.\n\nQuestioned by the President as to the destruction of Hippolyte Ballet's\nwill, Castaing admitted that he had seen a draft of a will executed by\nHippolyte in favour of his sister, but he denied having told Auguste\nthat Lebret had in his possession a copy which he was prepared to\ndestroy for 100,000 francs. Asked to explain the assertion of Mlle.\nPercillie, Auguste's mistress, that statements to this effect had been\nmade in her presence by both Auguste Ballet and himself, he said that it\nwas not true; that he had never been to her house. \"What motive,\" he was\nasked, \"could Mlle. Percillie have for accusing you?\" \"She hated me,\"\nwas the reply, \"because I had tried to separate Auguste from her.\"\nCastaing denied that he had driven with Auguste to Lebret's office on\nOctober 8. Asked to explain his sudden possession of 100,000 francs at a\nmoment when he was apparently without a penny, he repeated his statement\nthat Auguste had given him the capital sum as an equivalent for an\nincome of 4,000 francs which his brother had intended to leave him.\n\"Why, when first asked if you had received anything from Auguste, did\nyou say you had received nothing?\" was the question.\n\n\"It was a thoughtless statement,\" was the answer. \"Why,\" pursued the\nPresident, \"should you not have admitted at once a fact that went to\nprove your own good faith? If, however, this fact be true, it does not\nexplain the mysterious way in which Auguste asked Prignon to raise for\nhim 100,000 francs; and unless those 100,000 francs were given to you,\nit is impossible to account for them. It is important to your case that\nyou should give the jury a satisfactory explanation on this point.\"\nCastaing could only repeat his previous explanations.\n\nThe interrogatory was then directed to the death of Auguste Ballet.\nCastaing said that Auguste Ballet had left him all his fortune on\naccount of a disagreement with his sister. Asked why, after Auguste's\ndeath, he had at first denied all knowledge of the will made in his\nfavour and deposited by him with Malassis, he could give no satisfactory\nreason. Coming to the facts of the alleged poisoning of Auguste Ballet,\nthe President asked Castaing why, shortly after the warm wine was\nbrought up on the night of May 30, he went up to the room where one of\nthe servants of the hotel was lying sick. Castaing replied that he was\nsent for by the wife of the hotel-keeper. This the woman denied; she\nsaid that she did not even know that he was a doctor. \"According to\nthe prosecution,\" said the judge, \"you left the room in order to avoid\ndrinking your share of the wine.\" Castaing said that he had drunk half\na cupful of it. The judge reminded him that to one of the witnesses\nCastaing had said that he had drunk only a little.\n\nA ridiculous statement made by Castaing to explain the purchase of\nmorphia and antimony in Paris on May 31 was brought up against him.\nShortly after his arrest Castaing had said that the cats and dogs about\nthe hotel had made such a noise on the night of May 30 that they had\ndisturbed the rest of Auguste, who, in the early morning, had asked\nCastaing to get some poison to kill them. He had accordingly gone all\nthe way, about ten miles, to Paris at four in the morning to purchase\nantimony and morphia to kill cats and dogs. All the people of the\nhotel denied that there had been any such disturbance on the night in\nquestion. Castaing now said that he had bought the poisons at Auguste's\nrequest, partly to kill the noisy cats and dogs, and partly for the\npurpose of their making experiments on animals. Asked why he had not\ngiven this second reason before, he said that as Auguste was not a\nmedical man it would have been damaging to his reputation to divulge the\nfact of his wishing to make unauthorised experiments on animals. \"Why\ngo to Paris for the poison?\" asked the judge, \"there was a chemist a few\nyards from the hotel. And when in Paris, why go to two chemists?\" To all\nthese questions Castaing's answers were such as to lead the President\nto express a doubt as to whether they were likely to convince the jury.\nCastaing was obliged to admit that he had allowed, if not ordered, the\nevacuations of the sick man to be thrown away. He stated that he had\nthrown away the morphia and antimony, which he had bought in Paris,\nin the closets of the hotel, because, owing to the concatenation of\ncircumstances, he thought that he would be suspected of murder. In reply\nto a question from one of the jury, Castaing said that he had mixed\nthe acetate of morphia and tartar emetic together before reaching Saint\nCloud, but why he had done so he could not explain.\n\nThe medical evidence at the trial was favourable to the accused. Orfila,\nthe famous chemist of that day, said that, though the symptoms in\nAuguste Ballet's case might be attributed to poisoning by acetate of\nmorphia or some other vegetable poison, at the same time they could\nbe equally well attributed to sudden illness of a natural kind. The\nliquids, taken from the stomach of Ballet, had yielded on analysis no\ntrace of poison of any sort. The convulsive symptoms present in Ballet's\ncase were undoubtedly a characteristic result of a severe dose of\nacetate of morphia.(14) Castaing said that he had mixed the acetate of\nmorphia and tartar emetic together, but in any case no trace of either\npoison was found in Auguste's body, and his illness might, from all\nappearances, have been occasioned by natural causes. Some attempt was\nmade by the prosecution to prove that the apoplexy to which Hippolyte\nBallet had finally succumbed, might be attributed to a vegetable poison;\none of the doctors expressed an opinion favourable to that conclusion\n\"as a man but not as a physician.\" But the evidence did not go further.\n\n\n     (14) It was asserted some years later by one medical authority in\nPalmer's case that it might have been morphia and not strychnine that\nhad caused the tetanic symptoms which preceded Cook's death.\n\n\nTo the young priest-like doctor the ordeal of his trial was a severe\none. It lasted eight days. It was only at midday on the sixth day that\nthe evidence was concluded. Not only was Castaing compelled to submit to\na long interrogatory by the President, but, after each witness had given\nhis or her evidence, the prisoner was called on to refute or explain any\npoints unfavourable to him. This he did briefly, with varying success;\nas the trial went on, with increasing embarrassment. A great deal of\nthe evidence given against Castaing was hearsay, and would have been\ninadmissible in an English court of justice. Statements made by Auguste\nto other persons about Castaing were freely admitted. But more serious\nwas the evidence of Mlle. Percillie, Auguste's mistress. She swore that\non one occasion in her presence Castaing had reproached Auguste with\ningratitude; he had complained that he had destroyed one copy of\nHippolyte Ballet's will, and for Auguste's sake had procured the\ndestruction of the other, and that yet, in spite of all this, Auguste\nhesitated to entrust him with 100,000 francs. Asked what he had to say\nto this statement Castaing denied its truth. He had, he said, only been\nin Mlle. Percillie's house once, and then not with Auguste Ballet. Mlle.\nPercillie adhered to the truth of her evidence, and the President left\nit to the jury to decide between them.\n\nA Mme. Durand, a patient of Castaing, gave some curious evidence as to\na story told her by the young doctor. He said that a friend of his,\nsuffering from lung disease, had been persuaded into making a will in\nhis sister's favour. The sister had offered a bribe of 80,000 francs to\nher brother's lawyer to persuade him to make such a will, and paid one\nof his clerks 3,000 francs for drawing it up. Castaing, in his friend's\ninterest, and in order to expose the fraud, invited the clerk to come\nand see him. His friend, hidden in an alcove in the room, overheard the\nconversation between Castaing and the clerk, and so learnt the details\nof his sister's intrigue. He at once destroyed the will and became\nreconciled with his brother, whom he had been about to disinherit. After\nhis death the brother, out of gratitude, had given Castaing 100,000\nfrancs.\n\nPresident: Castaing, did you tell this story to Mme. Durand?\n\nCastaing: I don't recollect.\n\nAvocat-General: But Mme. Durand says that you did.\n\nCastaing: I don't recollect.\n\nPresident: You always say that you don't recollect; that is no answer.\nHave you, yes or no, made such a statement to Mme. Durand?\n\nCastaing: I don't recollect; if I had said it, I should recollect it.\n\nAnother lady whom Castaing had attended free of charge swore, with a\ngood deal of reluctance, that Castaing had told her a somewhat similar\nstory as accounting for his possession of 100,000 francs.\n\nWitnesses were called for the defence who spoke to the diligence and\ngood conduct of Castaing as a medical student; and eighteen, whom he had\ntreated free of expense, testified to his kindness and generosity. \"All\nthese witnesses,\" said the President, \"speak to your generosity; but,\nfor that very reason, you must have made little profit out of your\nprofession, and had little opportunity for saving anything,\" to which\nCastaing replied: \"These are not the only patients I attended; I have\nnot called those who paid me for my services.\" At the same time Castaing\nfound it impossible to prove that he had ever made a substantial living\nby the exercise of his profession.\n\nOne of the medical witnesses called for the defence, M. Chaussier, had\nvolunteered the remark that the absence of any trace of poison in the\nportions of Auguste Ballet's body submitted to analysis, constituted an\nabsence of the corpus delicti. To this the President replied that that\nwas a question of criminal law, and no concern of his. But in his speech\nfor the prosecution the Avocat-General dealt with the point raised\nat some length--a point which, if it had held good as a principle of\nEnglish law, would have secured the acquittal of so wicked a poisoner as\nPalmer. He quoted from the famous French lawyer d'Aguesseau: \"The corpus\ndelicti is no other thing than the delictum itself; but the proofs of\nthe delictum are infinitely variable according to the nature of things;\nthey may be general or special, principal or accessory, direct or\nindirect; in a word, they form that general effect (ensemble) which goes\nto determine the conviction of an honest man.\" If such a contention as\nM. Chaussier's were correct, said the Avocat-General, then it would\nbe impossible in a case of poisoning to convict a prisoner after his\nvictim's death, or, if his victim survived, to convict him of the\nattempt to poison. He reminded the jury of that paragraph in the Code\nof Criminal Procedure which instructed them as to their duties: \"The Law\ndoes not ask you to give the reasons that have convinced you; it\nlays down no rules by which you are to decide as to the fullness or\nsufficiency of proof... it only asks you one question: 'Have you an\ninward conviction?'\" \"If,\" he said, \"the actual traces of poison are a\nmaterial proof of murder by poison, then a new paragraph must be added\nto the Criminal Code--'Since, however, vegetable poisons leave no trace,\npoisoning by such means may be committed with impunity.'\" To poisoners\nhe would say in future: \"Bunglers that you are, don't use arsenic or any\nmineral poison; they leave traces; you will be found out. Use vegetable\npoisons; poison your fathers, poison your mothers, poison all your\nfamilies, and their inheritance will be yours--fear nothing; you will go\nunpunished! You have committed murder by poisoning, it is true; but the\ncorpus delicti will not be there because it can't be there!\" This was\na case, he urged, of circumstantial evidence. \"We have,\" he said, \"gone\nthrough a large number of facts. Of these there is not one that does not\ngo directly to the proof of poisoning, and that can only be explained on\nthe supposition of poisoning; whereas, if the theory of the defence\nbe admitted, all these facts, from the first to the last, become\nmeaningless and absurd. They can only be refuted by arguments or\nexplanations that are childish and ridiculous.\"\n\nCastaing was defended by two advocates--Roussel, a schoolfellow of his,\nand the famous Berryer, reckoned by some the greatest French orator\nsince Mirabeau. Both advocates were allowed to address the jury. Roussel\ninsisted on the importance of the corpus delicti. \"The delictum,\" he\nsaid, \"is the effect, the guilty man merely the cause; it is useless to\ndeal with the cause if the effect is uncertain,\" and he cited a case\nin which a woman had been sent for trial, charged with murdering her\nhusband; the moral proof of her guilt seemed conclusive, when suddenly\nher husband appeared in court alive and well. The advocate made a good\ndeal of the fact that the remains of the draught prescribed by Dr.\nPigache, a spoonful of which Castaing had given to Auguste Ballet,\nhad been analysed and showed no trace of poison. Against this the\nprosecution set the evidence of the chemist at Saint Cloud, who had made\nup the prescription. He said that the same day he had made up a second\nprescription similar to that of Dr. Pigache, but not made out for\nAuguste Ballet, which contained, in addition to the other ingredients,\nacetate of morphia. The original of this prescription he had given to a\nfriend of Castaing, who had come to his shop and asked him for it a few\ndays after Ballet's death. It would seem therefore that there had\nbeen two bottles of medicine, one of which containing morphia had\ndisappeared.\n\nM. Roussel combatted the suggestion that the family of Castaing were in\na state of indigence. He showed that his father had an income of 10,000\nfrancs, while his two brothers were holding good positions, one as an\nofficer in the army, the other as a government official. The mistress\nof Castaing he represented as enjoying an income of 5,000 francs.\nHe protested against the quantity of hearsay evidence that had been\nadmitted into the case. \"In England,\" he said, \"when a witness is\ncalled, he is asked 'What have you seen?' If he can only testify to mere\ntalk, and hearsay, he is not heard.\" He quoted the concluding paragraph\nof the will of Auguste Ballet as showing his friendly feeling towards\nCastaing: \"It is only after careful reflection that I have made\nthis final disposition of my property, in order to mark the sincere\nfriendship which I have never for one moment ceased to feel for MM.\nCastaing, Briant and Leuchere, in order to recognise the faithful\nloyalty of my servants, and deprive M. and Mme. Martignon, my\nbrother-in-law and sister, of all rights to which they might be legally\nentitled on my death, fully persuaded in soul and conscience that, in\ndoing so, I am giving to each their just and proper due.\" \"Is this,\"\nasked M. Roussel, \"a document wrested by surprise from a weak man,\nextorted by trickery? Is he not acting in the full exercise of his\nfaculties? He forgets no one, and justifies his conduct.\"\n\nWhen M. Roussel came to the incident of the noisy cats and dogs at Saint\nCloud, he was as ingenious as the circumstances permitted: \"A serious\ncharge engrosses public attention; men's minds are concentrated on\nthe large, broad aspects of the case; they are in a state of unnatural\nexcitement. They see only the greatness, the solemnity of the\naccusation, and then, suddenly, in the midst of all that is of such\ntragic and surpassing interest, comes this trivial fact about cats and\ndogs. It makes an unfavourable impression, because it is dramatically\nout of keeping with the tragedy of the story. But we are not here to\nconstruct a drama. No, gentlemen, look at it merely as a trivial\nincident of ordinary, everyday life, and you will see it in its proper\nlight.\" M. Roussel concluded by saying that Castaing's most eloquent\nadvocate, if he could have been present, would have been Auguste Ballet.\n\"If Providence had permitted him to enter this court, he would cry out\nto you, 'Save my friend's life! His heart is undefiled! He is\ninnocent!'\"\n\nM. Roussel concluded his speech at ten o'clock on Sunday night, November\n16. The next morning Berryer addressed the jury. His speech in defence\nof Castaing is not considered one of his most successful efforts. He\ngave personal testimony as to the taste of acetate of morphia. He said\nthat with the help of his own chemist he had put a quarter of a grain\nof the acetate into a large spoonful of milk, and had found it so\ninsupportably bitter to the taste that he could not keep it in his\nmouth. If, he contended, Ballet had been poisoned by tartar emetic, then\ntwelve grains given in milk would have given it an insipid taste, and\nvomiting immediately after would have got rid of the poison. Later\ninvestigations have shown that, in cases of antimonial poisoning,\nvomiting does not necessarily get rid of all the poison, and the\nconvulsions in which Auguste Ballet died are symptomatic of poisoning\neither by morphia or antimony. In conclusion, Berryer quoted the words\naddressed by one of the Kings of France to his judges: \"When God has not\nvouchsafed clear proof of a crime, it is a sign that He does not wish\nthat man should determine it, but leaves its judgment to a higher\ntribunal.\"\n\nThe Avocat-General, in reply, made a telling answer to M. Roussel's\nattempt to minimise the importance of the cats and dogs: \"He has spoken\nof the drama of life, and of its ordinary everyday incidents. If there\nis drama in this case, it is of Castaing's making. As to the ordinary\nincidents of everyday life, a man buys poison, brings it to the bedside\nof his sick friend, saying it is for experiments on cats and dogs, the\nfriend dies, the other, his sole heir, after foretelling his death,\ntakes possession of his keys, and proceeds to gather up the spoils--are\nthese ordinary incidents of every-day life?\"\n\nIt was nine o'clock at night when the jury retired to consider their\nverdict. They returned into court after two hours' deliberation. They\nfound the prisoner \"Not Guilty\" of the murder of Hippolyte Ballet,\n\"Guilty\" of destroying his will, and \"Guilty\" by seven votes to five\nof the murder of Auguste Ballet. Asked if he had anything to say before\njudgment was given, Castaing, in a very loud voice, said \"No; but I\nshall know how to die, though I am the victim of ill-fortune, of fatal\ncircumstance. I shall go to meet my two friends. I am accused of having\ntreacherously murdered them. There is a Providence above us! If there\nis such a thing as an immortal soul, I shall see Hippolyte and Auguste\nBallet again. This is no empty declamation; I don't ask for human pity\"\n(raising his hands to heaven), \"I look to God's mercy, and shall go\njoyfully to the scaffold. My conscience is clear. It will not reproach\nme even when I feel\" (putting his hands to his neck). \"Alas! It is\neasier to feel what I am feeling than to express what I dare not\nexpress.\" (In a feeble voice): \"You have desired my death; you have it!\"\nThe judges retired to consider the sentence. The candles were guttering,\nthe light of the lamps was beginning to fade; the aspect of the court\ngrim and terrible. M. Roussel broke down and burst into tears. Castaing\nleant over to his old schoolfellow: \"Courage, Roussel,\" he said; \"you\nhave always believed me innocent, and I am innocent. Embrace for me my\nfather, my mother, my brothers, my child.\" He turned to a group of young\nadvocates standing near: \"And you, young people, who have listened to\nmy trial, attend also my execution; I shall be as firm then as I am now.\nAll I ask is to die soon. I should be ashamed to plead for mercy.\" The\njudges returned. Castaing was condemned to death, and ordered to pay\n100,000 francs damages to the family of Auguste Ballet.\n\nCastaing was not ashamed to appeal to the Court of Cassation for a\nrevision of his trial, but on December 4 his appeal was rejected. Two\ndays later he was executed. He had attempted suicide by means of poison,\nwhich one of his friends had brought to him in prison, concealed inside\na watch. His courage failed him at the last, and he met his death in a\nstate of collapse.\n\nIt is not often, happily, that a young man of gentle birth and good\neducation is a double murderer at twenty-six. And such a soft, humble,\ninsinuating young man too!--good to his mother, good to his mistress,\nfond of his children, kind to his patients.\n\nYet this gentle creature can deliberately poison his two friends.\n\nWas ever such a contradictory fellow?\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Webster\n\n\nThe best report of Webster's trial is that edited by Bemis. The\nfollowing tracts in the British Museum have been consulted by the\nwriter: \"Appendix to the Webster Trial,\" Boston, 1850: \"Thoughts on the\nConviction of Webster\"; \"The Boston Tragedy,\" by W. E. Bigelow.\n\n\nIt is not often that the gaunt spectre of murder invades the cloistered\ncalm of academic life. Yet such a strange and unwonted tragedy befell\nHarvard University in the year 1849, when John W. Webster, Professor of\nChemistry, took the life of Dr. George Parkman, a distinguished citizen\nof Boston. The scene of the crime, the old Medical School, now a Dental\nHospital, is still standing, or was when the present writer visited\nBoston in 1907. It is a large and rather dreary red-brick, three-storied\nbuilding, situated in the lower part of the city, flanked on its west\nside by the mud flats leading down to the Charles River. The first\nfloor consists of two large rooms, separated from each other by the main\nentrance hall, which is approached by a flight of steps leading up\nfrom the street level. Of these two rooms, the left, as you face the\nbuilding, is fitted up as a lecture-room. In the year 1849 it was\nthe lecture-room of Professor Webster. Behind the lecture-room is a\nlaboratory, known as the upper laboratory, communicating by a private\nstaircase with the lower laboratory, which occupies the left wing of the\nground floor. A small passage, entered by a door on the left-hand side\nof the front of the building, separated this lower laboratory from the\ndissecting-room, an out-house built on to the west wall of the college,\nbut now demolished. From this description it will be seen that any\nperson, provided with the necessary keys, could enter the college by\nthe side-door near the dissecting room on the ground floor, and pass\nup through the lower and upper laboratory into Professor Webster's\nlecture-room without entering any other part of the building. The\nProfessor of Chemistry, by locking the doors of his lecture-rooms and\nthe lower laboratory, could, if he wished, make himself perfectly secure\nagainst intrusion, and come and go by the side-door without attracting\nmuch attention. These rooms are little altered at the present time from\ntheir arrangement in 1849. The lecture-room and laboratory are used for\nthe same purposes to-day; the lower laboratory, a dismal chamber, now\ndisused and somewhat rearranged, is still recognisable as the scene of\nthe Professor's chemical experiments.\n\nOn the second floor of the hospital is a museum, once anatomical, now\ndental. One of the principal objects of interest in this museum is a\nplaster cast of the jaws of Dr. George Parkman, made by a well-known\ndentist of Boston, Dr. Keep, in the year 1846. In that year the\nnew medical college was formally opened. Dr. Parkman, a wealthy and\npublic-spirited citizen of Boston, had given the piece of land, on which\nthe college had been erected. He had been invited to be present at the\nopening ceremony. In anticipation of being asked to make a speech on\nthis occasion Dr. Parkman, whose teeth were few and far between, had\nhimself fitted by Dr. Keep with a complete set of false teeth. Oliver\nWendell Holmes, then Professor of Anatomy at Harvard, who was present at\nthe opening of the college, noticed how very nice and white the doctor's\nteeth appeared to be. It was the discovery of the remains of these same\nadmirable teeth three years later in the furnace in Professor Webster's\nlower laboratory that led to the conviction of Dr. Parkman's murderer.\nBy a strange coincidence the doctor met his death in the very college\nwhich his generosity had helped to build. Though to-day the state of the\ncollege has declined from the medical to the dental, his memory still\nlives within its walls by the cast of his jaws preserved in the dental\nmuseum as a relic of a case, in which the art of dentistry did signal\nservice to the cause of justice.\n\nIn his lifetime Dr. Parkman was a well-known figure in the streets of\nBoston. His peculiar personal appearance and eccentric habits combined\nto make him something of a character. As he walked through the streets\nhe presented a remarkable appearance. He was exceptionally tall, longer\nin the body than the legs; his lower jaw protruded some half an inch\nbeyond the upper; he carried his body bent forward from the small of his\nback. He seemed to be always in a hurry; so impetuous was he that, if\nhis horse did not travel fast enough to please him, he would get off its\nback, and, leaving the steed in the middle of the street, hasten on his\nway on foot. A just and generous man, he was extremely punctilious in\nmatters of business, and uncompromising in his resentment of any form\nof falsehood or deceit. It was the force of his resentment in such a\ncase that cost him his life.\n\nThe doctor was unfailingly punctual in taking his meals. Dr. Kingsley,\nduring the fourteen years he had acted as his agent, had always been\nable to make sure of finding him at home at his dinner hour, half-past\ntwo o'clock. But on Friday, November 23, 1849, to his surprise and\nthat of his family, Dr. Parkman did not come home to dinner; and their\nanxiety was increased when the day passed, and there was still no sign\nof the doctor's return. Inquiries were made. From these it appeared that\nDr. Parkman had been last seen alive between one and two o'clock on the\nFriday afternoon. About half-past one he had visited a grocer's shop\nin Bridge Street, made some purchases, and left behind him a paper bag\ncontaining a lettuce, which, he said, he would call for on his way home.\nShortly before two o'clock he was seen by a workman, at a distance of\nforty or fifty feet from the Medical College, going in that direction.\nFrom that moment all certain trace of him was lost. His family knew that\nhe had made an appointment for half-past one that day, but where and\nwith whom they did not know. As a matter of fact, Professor John\nW. Webster had appointed that hour to receive Dr. Parkman in his\nlecture-room in the Medical College.\n\nJohn W. Webster was at this time Professor of Chemistry and Mineralogy\nin Harvard University, a Doctor of Medicine and a Member of the American\nAcademy of Arts and Sciences, the London Geological Society and the St.\nPetersburg Mineralogical Society. He was the author of several works\non geology and chemistry, a man now close on sixty years of age. His\ncountenance was genial, his manner mild and unassuming; he was clean\nshaven, wore spectacles, and looked younger than his years.\n\nProfessor Webster was popular with a large circle of friends. To those\nwho liked him he was a man of pleasing and attractive manners, artistic\nin his tastes--he was especially fond of music--not a very profound\nor remarkable chemist, but a pleasant social companion. His temper was\nhasty and irritable. Spoilt in his boyhood as an only child, he was\nself-willed and self-indulgent. His wife and daughters were better liked\nthan he. By unfriendly criticics{sic} the Professor was thought to be\nselfish, fonder of the good things of the table and a good cigar than\nwas consistent with his duty to his family or the smallness of his\nincome. His father, a successful apothecary at Boston, had died in 1833,\nleaving John, his only son, a fortune of some L10,000. In rather less\nthan ten years Webster had run through the whole of his inheritance. He\nhad built himself a costly mansion in Cambridge, spent a large sum\nof money in collecting minerals, and delighted to exercise lavish\nhospitality. By living consistently beyond his means he found himself\nat length entirely dependent on his professional earnings. These were\nsmall. His salary as Professor was fixed at L240 a year;(15) the rest of\nhis income he derived from the sale of tickets for his lectures at the\nMedical College. That income was insufficient to meet his wants.\n\n\n     (15) I have given these sums of money in their English equivalents\nin order to give the reader an idea of the smallness of the sum which\nbrought about the tragedy.\n\n\nAs early as 1842 he had borrowed L80 from his friend Dr. Parkman. It was\nto Parkman's good offices that he owed his appointment as a Professor at\nHarvard; they had entered the University as under-graduates in the same\nyear. Up to 1847 Webster had repaid Parkman twenty pounds of his debt;\nbut, in that year he found it necessary to raise a further loan of L490,\nwhich was subscribed by a few friends, among them Parkman himself. As\na security for the repayment of this loan, the professor executed a\nmortgage on his valuable collection of minerals in favour of Parkman.\nIn the April of 1848 the Professor's financial difficulties became so\nserious that he was threatened with an execution in his house. In this\npredicament he went to a Mr. Shaw, Dr. Parkman's brother-in-law, and\nbegged a loan of L240, offering him as security a bill of sale on the\ncollection of minerals, which he had already mortgaged to Parkman. Shaw\naccepted the security, and lent the money. Shaw would seem to have had\na good deal of sympathy with Webster's embarrassments; he considered the\nProfessor's income very inadequate to his position, and showed himself\nquite ready at a later period to waive his debt altogether.\n\nDr. Parkman was a less easy-going creditor. Forbearing and patient as\nlong as he was dealt with fairly, he was merciless where he thought\nhe detected trickery or evasion. His forbearance and his patience were\nutterly exhausted, his anger and indignation strongly aroused, when he\nlearnt from Shaw that Webster had given him as security for his debt\na bill of sale on the collection of minerals, already mortgaged to\nhimself. From the moment of the discovery of this act of dishonesty\non the part of Webster, Parkman pursued his debtor with unrelenting\nseverity.\n\nHe threatened him with an action at law; he said openly that he was\nneither an honourable, honest, nor upright man; he tried to appropriate\nto the payment of his debt the fees for lectures which Mr. Pettee,\nWebster's agent, collected on the Professor's behalf. He even visited\nWebster in his lecture-room and sat glaring at him in the front row\nof seats, while the Professor was striving under these somewhat\nunfavourable conditions to impart instruction to his pupils--a\nproceeding which the Doctor's odd cast of features must have aggravated\nin no small degree.\n\nIt was early in November that Parkman adopted these aggressive tactics.\nOn the 19th of that month Webster and the janitor of the College,\nEphraim Littlefield, were working in the upper laboratory. It was dark;\nthey had lit candles. Webster was reading a chemical book. As he looked\nup from the book he saw Parkman standing in the doorway leading from\nthe lecture-room. \"Dr. Webster, are you ready for me to-night?\" asked\nParkman. \"No,\" replied the other, \"I am not ready to-night.\" After a\nlittle further conversation in regard to the mortgage, Parkman departed\nwith the ominous remark, \"Doctor, something must be done to-morrow.\"\n\nUnfortunately the Professor was not in a position to do anything. He had\nno means sufficient to meet his creditor's demands; and that creditor\nwas unrelenting. On the 22nd Parkman rode into Cambridge, where Webster\nlived, to press him further, but failed to find him. Webster's patience,\nnone too great at any time, was being sorely tried. To whom could\nhe turn? What further resource was open to him? There was none. He\ndetermined to see his creditor once more. At 8 o'clock on the morning\nof Friday the 23rd, Webster called at Dr. Parkman's house and made the\nappointment for their meeting at the Medical College at half-past\none, to which the Doctor had been seen hastening just before his\ndisappearance. At nine o'clock the same morning Pettee, the agent, had\ncalled on the Professor at the College and paid him by cheque a balance\nof L28 due on his lecture tickets, informing him at the same time that,\nowing to the trouble with Dr. Parkman, he must decline to receive any\nfurther sums of money on his behalf. Webster replied that Parkman was\na nervous, excitable man, subject to mental aberrations, but he added,\n\"You will have no further trouble with Dr. Parkman, for I have settled\nwith him.\" It is difficult to see how the Professor could have settled,\nor proposed to settle, with his creditor on that day. A balance of L28\nat his bank, and the L18 which Mr. Pettee had paid to him that morning,\nrepresented the sum of Professor Webster's fortune on Friday, November\n23, 1849.\n\nSince the afternoon of that day the search for the missing Parkman had\nbeen unremitting. On the Saturday his friends communicated with the\npolice. On Sunday hand-bills were issued stating the fact of the\nDoctor's disappearance, and on Monday, the 26th, a description and\nthe offer of a considerable reward for the discovery of his body were\ncirculated both in and out of the city. Two days later a further reward\nwas offered. But these efforts were fruitless. The only person who gave\nany information beyond that afforded by those who had seen the Doctor in\nthe streets on the morning of his disappearance, was Professor Webster.\nAbout four o'clock on the Sunday afternoon the Professor called at the\nhouse of the Revd. Francis Parkman, the Doctor's brother. They were\nintimate friends. Webster had for a time attended Parkman's chapel; and\nMr. Parkman had baptised the Professor's grand-daughter. On this Sunday\nafternoon Mr. Parkman could not help remarking Webster's peculiar\nmanner. With a bare greeting and no expression of condolence with the\nfamily's distress, his visitor entered abruptly and nervously on the\nobject of his errand. He had called, he said, to tell Mr. Parkman that\nhe had seen his brother at the Medical College on Friday afternoon, that\nhe had paid him L90 which he owed him, and that the Doctor had in the\ncourse of their interview taken out a paper and dashed his pen\nthrough it, presumably as an acknowledgment of the liquidation of the\nProfessor's debt. Having communicated this intelligence to the somewhat\nastonished gentleman, Webster left him as abruptly as he had come.\n\nAnother relative of Dr. Parkman, his nephew, Mr. Parkman Blake, in the\ncourse of inquiries as to his uncle's fate, thought it right to see\nWebster. Accordingly he went to the college on Monday, the 26th, about\neleven o'clock in the morning. Though not one of his lecture days, the\njanitor Littlefield informed him that the Professor was in his room. The\ndoor of the lecture-room, however, was found to be locked, and it was\nonly after considerable delay that Mr. Blake gained admittance. As he\ndescended the steps to the floor of the lecture-room Webster, dressed in\na working suit of blue overalls and wearing on his head a smoking cap,\ncame in from the back door. Instead of advancing to greet his visitor,\nhe stood fixed to the spot, and waited, as if defensively, for Mr.\nBlake to speak. In answer to Mr. Blake's questions Webster described\nhis interview with Dr. Parkman on the Friday afternoon. He gave a\nvery similar account of it to that he had already given to Mr. Francis\nParkman. He added that at the end of their interview he had asked the\nDoctor for the return of the mortgage, to which the latter had replied,\n\"I haven't it with me, but I will see it is properly cancelled.\" Mr.\nBlake asked Webster if he could recollect in what form of money it\nwas that he had paid Dr. Parkman. Webster answered that he could only\nrecollect a bill of L20 on the New Zealand Bank: pressed on this point,\nhe seemed to rather avoid any further inquiries. Mr. Blake left him,\ndissatisfied with the result of his visit.\n\nOne particular in Webster's statement was unquestionably strange, if\nnot incredible. He had, he said, paid Parkman a sum of L90, which he\nhad given him personally, and represented the Doctor as having at their\ninterview promised to cancel the mortgage on the collection of minerals\nwhich Webster had given as security for the loan of L490 that had been\nsubscribed by Parkman and four of his friends. Now L120 of this loan\nwas still owing. If Webster's statement were true, Parkman had a perfect\nright to cancel Webster's personal debt to himself; but he had no right\nto cancel entirely the mortgage on the minerals, so long as money due to\nothers on that mortgage was yet unpaid. Was it conceivable that one so\nstrict and scrupulous in all monetary transactions as Parkman would have\nsettled his own personal claim, and then sacrificed in so discreditable\na manner the claims of others, for the satisfaction of which he had made\nhimself responsible?\n\nThere was yet another singular circumstance. On Saturday, the 24th, the\nday after his settlement with Parkman, Webster paid into his own account\nat the Charles River Bank the cheque for L18, lecture fees, handed\nover to him by the agent Pettee just before Dr. Parkman's visit on the\nFriday. This sum had not apparently gone towards the making up of the\nL90, which Webster said that he had paid to Parkman that day. The\nmeans by which Webster had been enabled to settle this debt became more\nmysterious than ever.\n\nOn Tuesday, November 27, the Professor received three other visitors in\nhis lecture-room. These were police officers who, in the course of\ntheir search for the missing man, felt it their duty to examine, however\nperfunctorily, the Medical College. With apologies to the Professor,\nthey passed through his lecture room to the laboratory at the back,\nand from thence, down the private stairs, past a privy, into the lower\nlaboratory. As they passed the privy one of the officers asked what\nplace it was. \"Dr. Webster's private lavatory,\" replied the janitor, who\nwas conducting them. At that moment Webster's voice called them away\nto examine the store-room in the lower laboratory, and after a cursory\nexamination the officers departed.\n\nThe janitor, Ephraim Littlefield, did not take the opportunity afforded\nhim by the visit of the police officers to impart to them the feelings\nof uneasiness; which the conduct of Professor Webster during the last\nthree days had excited in his breast. There were circumstances in the\nProfessor's behaviour which could not fail to attract the attention of\na man, whose business throughout the day was to dust and sweep\nthe College, light the fires and overlook generally the order and\ncleanliness of the building.\n\nLittlefield, it will be remembered, had seen Dr. Parkman on the Monday\nbefore his disappearance, when he visited Webster at the College, and\nbeen present at the interview, in the course of which the Doctor told\nWebster that \"something must be done.\" That Monday morning Webster asked\nLittlefield a number of questions about the dissecting-room vault, which\nwas situated just outside the door of the lower laboratory. He asked\nhow it was built, whether a light could be put into it, and how it was\nreached for the purpose of repair. On the following Thursday, the day\nbefore Parkman's disappearance, the Professor told Littlefield to get\nhim a pint of blood from the Massachusetts Hospital; he said that\nhe wanted it for an experiment. On the morning of Friday, the day of\nParkman's disappearance, Littlefield informed the Professor that he had\nbeen unsuccessful in his efforts to get the blood, as they had not been\nbleeding anyone lately at the hospital. The same morning Littlefield\nfound to his surprise a sledge-hammer behind the door of the Professor's\nback room; he presumed that it had been left there by masons, and took\nit down to the lower laboratory. This sledge-hammer Littlefield never\nsaw again. About a quarter to two that afternoon Littlefield, standing\nat the front door, after his dinner, saw Dr. Parkman coming towards\nthe College. At two o'clock Littlefield went up to Dr. Oliver Wendell\nHolmes' room, immediately above Professor Webster's, to help the Doctor\nto clear his table after his lecture, which was the last delivered that\nday. About a quarter of an hour later he let Dr. Holmes out, locked the\nfront door and began to clear out the stoves in the other lecture-rooms.\nWhen he reached Webster's he was surprised to find that both doors, that\nof the lecture room and that of the lower laboratory, were either locked\nor bolted. He could hear nothing but the running of water in one of the\nsinks. About half-past five Littlefield saw the Professor coming down\nthe back stairs with a lighted candle in his hand. Webster blew out the\ncandle and left the building. Late that night Littlefield again tried\nthe Professor's doors; they were still fastened. The janitor was\nsurprised at this, as he had never known such a thing to happen before.\n\nOn Saturday, the 24th, though not lecturing that day, the Professor came\nto the College in the morning. He told Littlefield to light the stove\nin the lower laboratory. When Littlefield made to pass from the\nlecture-room into the Professor's private room at the back, and so down\nby the private stairs to the lower laboratory, the Professor stopped him\nand told him to go round by the door in front of the building. The whole\nof that day and Sunday, the Professor's doors remained fast. On Sunday\nevening at sunset Littlefield, who was talking with a friend in North\nGrove Street, the street that faces the College, was accosted by\nWebster. The Professor asked him if he recollected Parkman's visit\nto the College on Friday, the 23rd, and, on his replying in the\naffirmative, the Professor described to him their interview and the\nrepayment of his debt. Littlefield was struck during their conversation\nby the uneasiness of the Professor's bearing; contrary to his habit he\nseemed unable to look him in the face, his manner was confused, his face\npale.\n\nDuring the whole of Monday, except for a visit from Mr. Parkman Blake,\nProfessor Webster was again locked alone in his laboratory. Neither\nthat night, nor early Tuesday morning, could Littlefield get into\nthe Professor's rooms to perform his customary duties. On Tuesday the\nProfessor lectured at twelve o'clock, and later received the visit of\nthe police officers that has been described already. At four o'clock\nthat afternoon, the Professor's bell rang. Littlefield answered it.\nThe Professor asked the janitor whether he had bought his turkey for\nThanksgiving Day, which was on the following Thursday. Littlefield said\nthat he had not done so yet. Webster then handed him an order on his\nprovision dealer. \"Take that,\" he said, \"and get a nice turkey; perhaps\nI shall want you to do some odd jobs for me.\" Littlefield thanked him,\nand said that he would be glad to do anything for him that he could. The\njanitor was the more surprised at Webster's generosity on this occasion,\nas this turkey was the first present he had received at the Professor's\nhands during the seven years he had worked in the College. Littlefield\nsaw the Professor again about half-past six that evening as the latter\nwas leaving the College. The janitor asked him if he wanted any more\nfires lighted in his rooms, because owing to the holidays there were\nto be no further lectures that week. Webster said that he did not, and\nasked Littlefield whether he were a freemason. The janitor said \"Yes,\"\nand with that they parted.\n\nLittlefield was curious. The mysterious activity of the Professor of\nChemistry seemed to him more than unusual. His perplexity was increased\non the following day. Though on account of the holidays all work had\nbeen suspended at the College for the remainder of the week, Webster was\nagain busy in his room early Wednesday morning. Littlefield could hear\nhim moving about. In vain did the janitor look through the keyhole, bore\na hole in the door, peep under it; all he could get was a sight of the\nProfessor's feet moving about the laboratory. Perplexity gave way to\napprehension when in the course of the afternoon Littlefield discovered\nthat the outer wall of the lower laboratory was so hot that he could\nhardly bear to place his hand on it. On the outer side of this wall was\na furnace sometimes used by the Professor in his chemical experiments.\nHow came it to be so heated? The Professor had told Littlefield on\nTuesday that he should not be requiring any fires during the remainder\nof the week.\n\nThe janitor determined to resolve his suspicions. He climbed up to the\nback windows of the lower laboratory, found one of them unfastened, and\nlet himself in. But, beyond evidences of the considerable fires that had\nbeen kept burning during the last few days, Littlefield saw nothing\nto excite peculiar attention. Still he was uneasy. Those he met in\nthe street kept on telling him that Dr. Parkman would be found in the\nMedical College. He felt that he himself was beginning to be suspected\nof having some share in the mystery, whilst in his own mind he became\nmore certain every day that the real solution lay within the walls\nof Professor Webster's laboratory. His attention had fixed itself\nparticularly on the lavatory at the foot of the stairs connecting the\nupper and lower laboratories. This room he found to be locked and the\nkey, a large one, had disappeared. He recollected that when the police\nofficers had paid their visit to the college, the Professor had\ndiverted their attention as they were about to inspect this room. The\nonly method by which, unknown to the Professor and without breaking open\nthe door, Littlefield could examine the vault of this retiring room was\nby going down to the basement floor of the college and digging a hole\nthrough the wall into the vault itself. This he determined to do.\n\nOn Thursday, Thanksgiving Day, Littlefield commenced operations with\na hatchet and a chisel. Progress was slow, as that evening he had been\ninvited to attend a festal gathering. On Friday the janitor, before\nresuming work, acquainted two of the Professors of the college with\nhis proposed investigation, and received their sanction. As Webster,\nhowever, was going constantly in and out of his rooms, he could make\nlittle further progress that day. The Professor had come into town early\nin the morning.\n\nBefore going to the college he purchased some fish-hooks and gave orders\nfor the making of a strong tin box with firm handles, a foot and a half\nsquare and a little more than a foot in depth; during the rest of the\nday he had been busy in his rooms until he left the college about four\no'clock. Not till then was the watchful janitor able to resume his\nlabours. Armed with a crowbar, he worked vigorously until he succeeded\nin penetrating the wall sufficiently to admit a light into the vault of\nthe lavatory. The first objects which the light revealed to his eyes,\nwere the pelvis of a man and two parts of a human leg.\n\nLeaving his wife in charge of the remains, Littlefield went immediately\nto the house of Professor Bigelow, and informed him of the result of\nhis search. They returned to the college some twenty minutes later,\naccompanied by the City Marshal. The human remains--a pelvis, a thigh\nand a leg--were taken out of the vault, and on a further search some\npieces of bone were removed from one of the furnaces in the lower\nlaboratory. The City Marshal at once dispatched three of his officers to\nCambridge, to the house of Professor Webster.\n\nTo his immediate circle of friends and relations the conduct of\nthe Professor during this eventful week had betrayed no unwonted\ndiscomposure or disturbance of mind. His evenings had been spent either\nat the house of friends, or at his own, playing whist, or reading\nMilton's \"Allegro\" and \"Penseroso\" to his wife and daughters. On Friday\nevening, about eight o'clock, as the Professor was saying good-bye to a\nfriend on the steps of his house at Cambridge, the three police officers\ndrove up to the door and asked him to accompany them to the Medical\nCollege. It was proposed, they said, to make a further search there that\nevening, and his presence was considered advisable. Webster assented\nimmediately, put on his boots, his hat and coat, and got into the hired\ncoach. As they drove towards the city, Webster spoke to the officers\nof Parkman's disappearance, and suggested that they should stop at the\nhouse of a lady who, he said, could give them some peculiar information\non that subject. As they entered Boston, he remarked that they were\ntaking the wrong direction for reaching the college. One of the officers\nreplied that the driver might be \"green,\" but that he would find his\nway to the college in time. At length the coach stopped. One of the\nofficers alighted, and invited his companions to follow him into the\noffice of the Leverett Street Jail. They obeyed. The Professor asked\nwhat it all meant; he was informed that he must consider himself\nin custody, charged with the murder of Dr. George Parkman. Webster,\nsomewhat taken aback, desired that word should be sent to his family,\nbut was dissuaded from his purpose for the time being. He was searched,\nand among other articles taken from him was a key some four or five\ninches long; it was the missing lavatory key. Whilst one of the officers\nwithdrew to make out a mittimus, the Professor asked one of the others\nif they had found Dr. Parkman. The officer begged him not to question\nhim. \"You might tell me something about it,\" pleaded Webster. \"Where did\nthey find him? Did they find the whole body? Oh, my children! What will\nthey do? What will they think of me? Where did you get the information?\"\nThe officers asked him if anybody had access to his apartments but\nhimself. \"Nobody,\" he replied, \"but the porter who makes the fire.\"\nThen, after a pause, he exclaimed: \"That villain! I am a ruined man.\"\nHe was walking up and down wringing his hands, when one of the officers\nsaw him put one hand into his waistcoat pocket, and raise it to his\nlips. A few moments later the unhappy man was seized with violent\nspasms. He was unable to stand, and was laid down in one of the cells.\nFrom this distressing state he was roused shortly before eleven, to be\ntaken to the college. He was quite incapable of walking, and had to be\nsupported by two of the officers. He was present there while his rooms\nwere searched; but his state was painful in the extreme. He asked for\nwater, but trembled so convulsively that he could only snap at the\ntumbler like a dog; his limbs were rigid; tears and sweat poured down\nhis cheeks. On the way back to the jail, one of the officers, moved\nby his condition, expressed his pity for him. \"Do you pity me? Are you\nsorry for me? What for?\" asked Webster. \"To see you so excited,\" replied\nthe officer. \"Oh! that's it,\" said the Professor.\n\nThe whole night through the prisoner lay without moving, and not until\nthe following afternoon were his limbs relaxed sufficiently to allow of\nhis sitting up. As his condition improved, he grew more confident. \"That\nis no more Dr. Parkman's body,\" he said, \"than mine. How in the world\nit came there I don't know,\" and he added: \"I never liked the looks of\nLittlefield the janitor; I opposed his coming there all I could.\"\n\nIn the meantime a further examination of the Professor's rooms on\nSaturday had resulted in the discovery, in a tea-chest in the lower\nlaboratory, of a thorax, the left thigh of a leg, and a hunting knife\nembedded in tan and covered over with minerals; some portions of bone\nand teeth were found mixed with the slag and cinders of one of the\nfurnaces; also some fish-hooks and a quantity of twine, the latter\nidentical with a piece of twine that had been tied round the thigh found\nin the chest.\n\nTwo days later the Professor furnished unwittingly some additional\nevidence against himself. On the Monday evening after his arrest he\nwrote from prison to one of his daughters the following letter:\n\n\n\"MY DEAREST MARIANNE,--I wrote Mama yesterday; I had a good sleep last\nnight, and dreamt of you all. I got my clothes off, for the first time,\nand awoke in the morning quite hungry. It was a long time before my\nfirst breakfast from Parker's came; and it was relished, I can assure\nyou. At one o'clock I was notified that I must appear at the court room.\nAll was arranged with great regard to my comfort, and went off better\nthan I had anticipated.\n\n\"On my return I had a bit of turkey and rice from Parker's. They send\nmuch more than I can eat, and I have directed the steward to distribute\nthe surplus to any poor ones here.\n\n\"If you will send me a small canister of tea, I can make my own. A\nlittle pepper I may want some day. I would send the dirty clothes, but\nthey were taken to dry. Tell Mama NOT TO OPEN the little bundle I gave\nher the other day, but to keep it just as she received it. With many\nkisses to you all. Good night!--From your affectionate\n\n\"FATHER.\"\n\n\"P.S.--My tongue troubles me yet very much, and I must have bitten it\nin my distress the other night; it is painful and swollen, affecting my\nspeech. Had Mama better send for Nancy? I think so; or Aunt Amelia.\"\n\n\"Couple of coloured neck handkerchiefs, one Madras.\"\n\n\nThis letter, which shows an anxiety about his personal comfort singular\nin one so tragically situated, passed through the hands of the keeper\nof the jail. He was struck by the words underlined, \"NOT TO OPEN,\"\nin regard to the small bundle confided to Mrs. Webster. He called the\nattention of the police to this phrase. They sent immediately an officer\narmed with a search warrant to the Professor's house. He received from\nMrs. Webster among other papers a package which, on being opened,\nwas found to contain the two notes given by Webster to Parkman as\nacknowledgments of his indebtedness to him in 1842 and 1847, and a paper\nshowing the amount of his debts to Parkman in 1847. There were daubs and\nerasures made across these documents, and across one was written twice\nover the word \"paid.\" All these evidences of payments and cancellations\nappeared on examination to be in the handwriting of the Professor.\n\nAfter an inquest lasting nine days the coroner's jury declared the\nremains found in the college to be those of Dr. George Parkman, and that\nthe deceased had met his death at the hands of Professor J. W. Webster.\nThe prisoner waived his right to a magisterial investigation, and on\nJanuary 26, 1850, the Grand Jury returned a true bill. But it was not\nuntil March 17 that the Professor's trial opened before the Supreme\nCourt of Massachusetts. The proceedings were conducted with that\ndignity and propriety which we look for in the courts of that State.\nThe principal features in the defence were an attempt to impugn the\ntestimony of the janitor Littlefield, and to question the possibility\nof the identification of the remains of Parkman's teeth. There was a\nfurther attempt to prove that the deceased had been seen by a number\nof persons in the streets of Boston on the Friday afternoon, after his\nvisit to the Medical College. The witness Littlefield was unshaken by a\nsevere cross-examination. The very reluctance with which Dr. Keep\ngave his fatal evidence, and the support given to his conclusions\nby distinguished testimony told strongly in favour of the absolute\ntrustworthiness of his statements. The evidence called to prove that\nthe murdered man had been seen alive late on Friday afternoon was highly\ninconclusive.\n\nContrary to the advice of his counsel, Webster addressed the jury\nhimself. He complained of the conduct of his case, and enumerated\nvarious points that his counsel had omitted to make, which he conceived\nto be in his favour. The value of his statements may be judged by the\nfact that he called God to witness that he had not written any one of\nthe anonymous letters, purporting to give a true account of the doctor's\nfate, which had been received by the police at the time of Parkman's\ndisappearance. After his condemnation Webster confessed to the\nauthorship of at least one of them.\n\nThe jury retired at eight o'clock on the eleventh day of the trial. They\nwould seem to have approached their duty in a most solemn and devout\nspirit, and it was with the greatest reluctance and after some searching\nof heart that they brought themselves to find the prisoner guilty of\nwilful murder. On hearing their verdict, the Professor sank into a seat,\nand, dropping his head, rubbed his eyes behind his spectacles as if\nwiping away tears. On the following morning the Chief Justice sentenced\nhim to death after a well-meaning speech of quite unnecessary length and\nelaboration, at the conclusion of which the condemned man wept freely.\n\nA petition for a writ of error having been dismissed, the Professor in\nJuly addressed a petition for clemency to the Council of the State. Dr.\nPutnam, who had been attending Webster in the jail, read to the Council\na confession which he had persuaded the prisoner to make. According to\nthis statement Webster had, on the Friday afternoon, struck Parkman on\nthe head with a heavy wooden stick in a wild moment of rage, induced by\nthe violent taunts and threats of his creditor. Appalled by his deed,\nhe had in panic locked himself in his room, and proceeded with desperate\nhaste to dismember the body; he had placed it for that purpose in the\nsink in his back room, through which was running a constant stream of\nwater that carried away the blood. Some portions of the body he had\nburnt in the furnace; those in the lavatory and the tea-chest he had\nconcealed there, until he should have had an opportunity of getting rid\nof them.\n\nIn this statement Professor Webster denied all premeditation. Dr. Putnam\nasked him solemnly whether he had not, immediately before the crime,\nmeditated at any time on the advantages that would accrue to him\nfrom Parkman's death. Webster replied \"Never, before God!\" He had, he\nprotested, no idea of doing Parkman an injury until the bitter tongue\nof the latter provoked him. \"I am irritable and violent,\" he said, \"a\nquickness and brief violence of temper has been the besetting sin of my\nlife. I was an only child, much indulged, and I have never secured the\ncontrol over my passions that I ought to have acquired early; and the\nconsequence is--all this!\" He denied having told Parkman that he was\ngoing to settle with him that afternoon, and said that he had asked him\nto come to the college with the sole object of pleading with him for\nfurther indulgence. He explained his convulsive seizure at the time\nof his arrest by his having taken a dose of strychnine, which he had\ncarried in his pocket since the crime. In spite of these statements and\nthe prayers of the unfortunate man's wife and daughters, who, until his\nconfession to Dr. Putnam, had believed implicity in his innocence, the\nCouncil decided that the law must take its course, and fixed August 30\nas the day of execution.\n\nThe Professor resigned himself to his fate. He sent for Littlefield and\nhis wife, and expressed his regret for any injustice he had done them:\n\"All you said was true. You have misrepresented nothing.\" Asked by the\nsheriff whether he was to understand from some of his expressions that\nhe contemplated an attempt at suicide, \"Why should I?\" he replied,\n\"all the proceedings in my case have been just... and it is just that\nI should die upon the scaffold in accordance with that sentence.\"\n\"Everybody is right,\" he said to the keeper of the jail, \"and I am\nwrong. And I feel that, if the yielding up of my life to the injured\nlaw will atone, even in part, for the crime I have committed, that is a\nconsolation.\"\n\nIn a letter to the Reverend Francis Parkman he expressed deep contrition\nfor his guilt. He added one sentence which may perhaps fairly express\nthe measure of premeditation that accompanied his crime. \"I had never,\"\nhe wrote, \"until the two or three last interviews with your brother,\nfelt towards him anything but gratitude for his many acts of kindness\nand friendship.\"\n\nProfessor Webster met his death with fortitude and resignation. That he\ndeserved his fate few will be inclined to deny. The attempt to procure\nblood, the questions about the dissecting-room vault, the appointment\nmade with Parkman at the college, the statement to Pettee, all point to\nsome degree of premeditation, or at least would make it appear that the\nmurder of Parkman had been considered by him as a possible eventuality.\nHis accusation of Littlefield deprives him of a good deal of sympathy.\nOn the other hand, the age and position of Webster, the aggravating\npersistency of Parkman, his threats and denunciations, coupled with his\nown shortness of temper, make it conceivable that he may have killed his\nvictim on a sudden and overmastering provocation, in which case he had\nbetter at once have acknowledged his crime instead of making a repulsive\nattempt to conceal it. But for the evidence of Dr. Keep he would\npossibly have escaped punishment altogether. Save for the portions\nof his false teeth, there was not sufficient evidence to identify the\nremains found in the college as those of Parkman. Without these teeth\nthe proof of the corpus delicti would have been incomplete, and so\nafforded Webster a fair chance of acquittal.\n\n\n\n\nThe Mysterious Mr. Holmes\n\n\n\"The Holmes-Pitezel Case,\" by F. B. Geyer, 1896; \"Holmes' Own Story,\"\nPhiladelphia, 1895; and \"Celebrated Criminal Cases of America,\" by T. S.\nDuke, San Francisco, are the authorities for this account of the case.\n\n\n\nI\n\nHONOUR AMONGST THIEVES\n\nIn the year 1894 Mr. Smith, a carpenter, of Philadelphia, had patented a\nnew saw-set. Wishing to make some money out of his invention, Mr. Smith\nwas attracted by the sign:\n\nB. F. PERRY\n\nPATENTS BOUGHT AND SOLD\n\nwhich he saw stretched across the window of a two-storied house, 1,316\nCallowhill Street. He entered the house and made the acquaintance of Mr.\nPerry, a tall, dark, bony man, to whom he explained the merits of his\ninvention. Perry listened with interest, and asked for a model. In the\nmeantime he suggested that Smith should do some carpenter's work for him\nin the house. Smith agreed, and on August 22, while at work there saw a\nman enter the house and go up with Perry to a room on the second story.\n\nA few days later Smith called at Callowhill Street to ask Perry about\nthe sale of the patent. He waited half an hour in the shop below, called\nout to Perry who, he thought, might be in the rooms above, received no\nanswer and went away. Next day, September 4, Smith returned, found the\nplace just as he had left it the day before; called Perry again, but\nagain got no answer. Surprised, he went upstairs, and in the back room\nof the second story the morning sunshine, streaming through the window,\nshowed him the dead body of a man, his face charred beyond recognition,\nlying with his feet to the window and his head to the door. There was\nevidence of some sort of explosion: a broken bottle that had contained\nan inflammable substance, a broken pipe filled with tobacco, and a burnt\nmatch lay by the side of the body.\n\nThe general appearance of the dead man answered to that of B. F. Perry.\nA medical examination of the body showed that death had been sudden,\nthat there had been paralysis of the involuntary muscles, and that the\nstomach, besides showing symptoms of alcoholic irritation, emitted a\nstrong odour of chloroform. An inquest was held, and a verdict returned\nthat B. F. Perry had died of congestion of the lungs caused by the\ninhalation of flame or chloroform. After lying in the mortuary for\neleven days the body was buried.\n\nIn the meantime the Philadelphia branch of the Fidelity Mutual Life\nAssociation had received a letter from one Jephtha D. Howe, an attorney\nat St. Louis, stating that the deceased B. F. Perry was Benjamin F.\nPitezel of that city, who had been insured in their office for a sum of\nten thousand dollars. The insurance had been effected in Chicago in the\nNovember of 1893. Mr. Howe proposed to come to Philadelphia with some\nmembers of the Pitezel family to identify the remains. Referring to\ntheir Chicago branch, the insurance company found that the only person\nwho would seem to have known Pitezel when in that city, was a certain\nH. H. Holmes, living at Wilmette, Illinois. They got into communication\nwith Mr. Holmes, and forwarded to him a cutting from a newspaper, which\nstated erroneously that the death of B. F. Perry had taken place in\nChicago.\n\nOn September 18 they received a letter from Mr. Holmes, in which he\noffered what assistance he could toward the identification of B. F.\nPerry as B. F. Pitezel. He gave the name of a dentist in Chicago who\nwould be able to recognise teeth which he had made for Pitezel, and\nhimself furnished a description of the man, especially of a malformation\nof the knee and a warty growth on the back of the neck by which he could\nbe further identified. Mr. Holmes offered, if his expenses were paid, to\ncome to Chicago to view the body. Two days later he wrote again saying\nthat he had seen by other papers that Perry's death had taken place in\nPhiladelphia and not in Chicago, and that as he had to be in Baltimore\nin a day or two, he would run over to Philadelphia and visit the office\nof the Fidelity Life Association.\n\nOn September 20 the assiduous Mr. Holmes called at the office of the\nAssociation in Philadelphia, inquired anxiously about the nature and\ncause of Perry's death, gave again a description of him and, on learning\nthat Mr. Howe, the attorney from St. Louis, was about to come to\nPhiladelphia to represent the widow, Mrs. Pitezel, and complete the\nidentification, said that he would return to give the company any\nfurther help he could in the matter. The following day Mr. Jephtha D.\nHowe, attorney of St. Louis, arrived in Philadelphia, accompanied by\nAlice Pitezel, a daughter of the deceased. Howe explained that Pitezel\nhad taken the name of Perry owing to financial difficulties. The company\nsaid that they accepted the fact that Perry and Pitezel were one and the\nsame man, but were not convinced that the body was Pitezel's body.\nThe visit of Holmes was mentioned. Howe said that he did not know Mr.\nHolmes, but would be willing to meet him. At this moment Holmes arrived\nat the office. He was introduced to Howe as a stranger, and recognised\nas a friend by Alice Pitezel, a shy, awkward girl of fourteen or fifteen\nyears of age. It was then arranged that all the parties should meet\nagain next day to identify, if possible, the body, which had been\ndisinterred for that purpose.\n\nThe unpleasant duty of identifying the rapidly decomposing remains was\ngreatly curtailed by the readiness of Mr. Holmes. When the party met on\nthe 22nd at the Potter's Field, where the body had been disinterred and\nlaid out, the doctor present was unable to find the distinctive marks\nwhich would show Perry and Pitezel to have been the same man. Holmes at\nonce stepped into the breach, took off his coat, rolled up his sleeves,\nput on the rubber gloves, and taking a surgeon's knife from his pocket,\ncut off the wart at the back of the neck, showed the injury to the\nleg, and revealed also a bruised thumbnail which had been another\ndistinctive mark of Pitezel. The body was then covered up all but\nthe teeth; the girl Alice was brought in, and she said that the teeth\nappeared to be like those of her father. The insurance company declared\nthemselves satisfied, and handed to Mr. Howe a cheque for 9,175 dollars,\nand to Mr. Holmes ten dollars for his expenses. Smith, the carpenter,\nhad been present at the proceedings at the Potter's Field. For a moment\nhe thought he detected a likeness in Mr. Holmes to the man who had\nvisited Perry at Callowhill Street on August 22 and gone upstairs with\nhim, but he did not feel sure enough of the fact to make any mention of\nit.\n\nIn the prison at St. Louis there languished in the year 1894 one Marion\nHedgspeth, serving a sentence of twenty years' imprisonment for\nan audacious train robbery. On the night of November 30, 1891, the\n'Friscow express from St. Louis had been boarded by four ruffians, the\nexpress car blown open with dynamite, and 10,000 dollars carried off.\nHedgspeth and another man were tried for the robbery, and sentenced to\ntwenty years' imprisonment. On October 9, 1894, Hegspeth{sic} made a\nstatement to the Governor of the St. Louis prison, which he said he\nwished to be communicated to the Fidelity Mutual Life Association. In\nthe previous July Hedgspeth said that he had met in the prison a man\nof the name of H. M. Howard, who was charged with fraud, but had\nbeen released on bail later in the month. While in prison Howard told\nHedgspeth that he had devised a scheme for swindling an insurance\ncompany of 10,000 dollars, and promised Hedgspeth that, if he would\nrecommend him a lawyer suitable for such an enterprise, he should have\n500 dollars as his share of the proceeds. Hedgspeth recommended Jephtha\nD. Howe. The latter entered with enthusiasm into the scheme, and told\nHedgspeth that he thought Mr. Howard \"one of the smoothest and slickest\"\nmen he had ever known. A corpse was to be found answering to Pitezel's\ndescription, and to be so treated as to appear to have been the victim\nof an accidental explosion, while Pitezel himself would disappear to\nGermany. From Howe Hedgspeth learnt that the swindle had been carried\nout successfully, but he had never received from Howard the 500 dollars\npromised him. Consequently, he had but little compunction in divulging\nthe plot to the authorities.\n\nIt was realised at once that H. M. Howard and H. H. Holmes were the same\nperson, and that Jephtha D. Howe and Mr. Holmes were not the\nstrangers to each other that they had affected to be when they met\nin Philadelphia. Though somewhat doubtful of the truth of Hedgspeth's\nstatement, the insurance company decided to set Pinkerton's detectives\non the track of Mr. H. H. Holmes. After more than a month's search he\nwas traced to his father's house at Gilmanton, N. H., and arrested in\nBoston on November 17.\n\nInquiry showed that, early in 1894, Holmes and Pitezel had acquired some\nreal property at Fort Worth in Texas and commenced building operations,\nbut had soon after left Texas under a cloud, arising from the theft of a\nhorse and other dubious transactions.\n\nHolmes had obtained the property at Fort Worth from a Miss Minnie\nWilliams, and transferred it to Pitezel. Pitezel was a drunken \"crook,\"\nof mean intelligence, a mesmeric subject entirely under the influence of\nHolmes, who claimed to have considerable hypnotic powers. Pitezel had a\nwife living at St. Louis and five children, three girls--Dessie, Alice,\nand Nellie--a boy, Howard, and a baby in arms. At the time of Holmes'\narrest Mrs. Pitezel, with her eldest daughter, Dessie, and her little\nbaby, was living at a house rented by Holmes at Burlington, Vermont. She\nalso was arrested on a charge of complicity in the insurance fraud and\nbrought to Boston.\n\nTwo days after his arrest Holmes, who dreaded being sent back to Texas\non a charge of horse-stealing, for which in that State the punishment is\napt to be rough and ready, made a statement to the police, in which he\nacknowledged the fraud practised by him and Pitezel on the insurance\ncompany. The body substituted for Pitezel had been obtained, said\nHolmes, from a doctor in New York, packed in a trunk and sent to\nPhiladelphia, but he declined for the present to give the doctor's name.\nPitezel, he said, had gone with three of his children--Alice, Nellie\nand Howard--to South America. This fact, however, Holmes had not\ncommunicated to Mrs. Pitezel. When she arrived at Boston, the poor woman\nwas in great distress of mind. Questioned by the officers, she attempted\nto deny any complicity in the fraud, but her real anxiety was to get\nnews of her husband and her three children. Alice she had not seen since\nthe girl had gone to Philadelphia to identify the supposed remains of\nher father. Shortly after this Holmes had come to Mrs. Pitezel at St.\nLouis, and taken away Nellie and Howard to join Alice, who, he said,\nwas in the care of a widow lady at Ovington, Kentucky. Since then Mrs.\nPitezel had seen nothing of the children or her husband. At Holmes'\ndirection she had gone to Detroit, Toronto, Ogdensberg and, lastly, to\nBurlington in the hope of meeting either Pitezel or the children, but\nin vain. She believed that her husband had deserted her; her only desire\nwas to recover her children.\n\nOn November 20 Holmes and Mrs. Pitezel were transferred from Boston\nto Philadelphia, and there, along with Benjamin Pitezel and Jephtha\nD. Howe, were charged with defrauding the Fidelity Life Association of\n10,000 dollars. Soon after his arrival in Philadelphia Holmes, who was\nnever averse to talking, was asked by an inspector of the insurance\ncompany who it was that had helped him to double up the body sent from\nNew York and pack it into the trunk. He replied that he had done it\nalone, having learned the trick when studying medicine in Michigan. The\ninspector recollected that the body when removed from Callowhill Street\nhad been straight and rigid. He asked Holmes what trick he had learnt in\nthe course of his medical studies by which it was possible to re-stiffen\na body once the rigor mortis had been broken. To this Holmes made no\nreply. But he realised his mistake, and a few weeks later volunteered\na second statement. He now said that Pitezel, in a fit of depression,\naggravated by his drinking habits, had committed suicide on the third\nstory of the house in Callowhill Street. There Holmes had found his\nbody, carried it down on to the floor below, and arranged it in the\nmanner agreed upon for deceiving the insurance company. Pitezel, he\nsaid, had taken his life by lying on the floor and allowing chloroform\nto run slowly into his mouth through a rubber tube placed on a chair.\nThe three children, Holmes now stated, had gone to England with a friend\nof his, Miss Minnie Williams.\n\nMiss Minnie Williams was the lady, from whom Holmes was said to have\nacquired the property in Texas which he and Pitezel had set about\ndeveloping. There was quite a tragedy, according to Holmes, connected\nwith the life of Miss Williams. She had come to Holmes in 1893, as\nsecretary, at a drug store which he was then keeping in Chicago. Their\nrelations had become more intimate, and later in the year Miss Williams\nwrote to her sister, Nannie, saying that she was going to be married,\nand inviting her to the wedding. Nannie arrived, but unfortunately a\nviolent quarrel broke out between the two sisters, and Holmes came home\nto find that Minnie in her rage had killed her sister. He had helped\nher out of the trouble by dropping Nannie's body into the Chicago lake.\nAfter such a distressing occurrence Miss Williams was only too glad of\nthe opportunity of leaving America with the Pitezel children. In the\nmeantime Holmes, under the name of Bond, and Pitezel, under that of\nLyman, had proceeded to deal with Miss Williams' property in Texas.\n\nFor women Holmes would always appear to have possessed some power of\nattraction, a power of which he availed himself generously. Holmes,\nwhose real name was Herman W. Mudgett, was thirty-four years of age\nat the time of his arrest. As a boy he had spent his life farming in\nVermont, after which he had taken up medicine and acquired some kind\nof medical degree. In the course of his training Holmes and a fellow\nstudent, finding a body that bore a striking resemblance to the latter;\nobtained 1,000 dollars from an insurance company by a fraud similar\nto that in which Holmes had engaged subsequently with Pitezel. After\nspending some time on the staff of a lunatic asylum in Pennsylvania,\nHolmes set up as a druggist in Chicago. His affairs in this city\nprospered, and he was enabled to erect, at the corner of Wallace and\nSixty-Third Streets, the four-storied building known later as \"Holmes\nCastle.\" It was a singular structure. The lower part consisted of a shop\nand offices. Holmes occupied the second floor, and had a laboratory on\nthe third. In his office was a vault, air proof and sound proof. In the\nbathroom a trap-door, covered by a rug, opened on to a secret staircase\nleading down to the cellar, and a similar staircase connected the cellar\nwith the laboratory. In the cellar was a large grate. To this building\nMiss Minnie Williams had invited her sister to come for her wedding\nwith Holmes, and it was in this building, according to Holmes, that the\ntragedy of Nannie's untimely death occurred.\n\nIn hoping to become Holmes' wife, Miss Minnie Williams was not to enjoy\nan exclusive privilege. At the time of his arrest Holmes had three\nwives, each ignorant of the others' existence. He had married the first\nin 1878, under the name of Mudgett, and was visiting her at Burlington,\nVermont, when the Pinkerton detectives first got on his track. The\nsecond he had married at Chicago, under the name of Howard, and the\nthird at Denver as recently as January, 1894, under the name of Holmes.\nThe third Mrs. Holmes had been with him when he came to Philadelphia to\nidentify Pitezel's body. The appearance of Holmes was commonplace, but\nhe was a man of plausible and ingratiating address, apparent candour,\nand able in case of necessity to \"let loose,\" as he phrased it, \"the\nfount of emotion.\"\n\nThe year 1895 opened to find the much enduring Holmes still a prisoner\nin Philadelphia. The authorities seemed in no haste to indict him for\nfraud; their interest was concentrated rather in endeavouring to find\nthe whereabouts of Miss Williams and her children, and of one Edward\nHatch, whom Holmes had described as helping him in arranging for\ntheir departure. The \"great humiliation\" of being a prisoner was very\ndistressing to Holmes.\n\n     \"I only know the sky has lost its blue,\n     The days are weary and the night is drear.\"\n\nThese struck him as two beautiful lines very appropriate to his\nsituation. He made a New Year's resolve to give up meat during his close\nconfinement. The visits of his third wife brought him some comfort. He\nwas \"agreeably surprised\" to find that, as an unconvicted prisoner, he\ncould order in his own meals and receive newspapers and periodicals. But\nhe was hurt at an unfriendly suggestion on the part of the authorities\nthat Pitezel had not died by his own hand, and that Edward Hatch was but\na figment of his rich imagination. He would like to have been released\non bail, but in the same unfriendly spirit was informed that, if he\nwere, he would be detained on a charge of murder. And so the months\ndragged on. Holmes, studious, patient, injured, the authorities puzzled,\nsuspicions, baffled--still no news of Miss Williams or the three\nchildren. It was not until June 3 that Holmes was put on his trial for\nfraud, and the following day pleaded guilty. Sentence was postponed.\n\nThe same day Holmes was sent for to the office of the District Attorney,\nwho thus addressed him: \"It is strongly suspected, Holmes, that you have\nnot only murdered Pitezel, but that you have killed the children. The\nbest way to remove this suspicion is to produce the children at once.\nNow, where are they?\" Unfriendly as was this approach, Holmes met it\ncalmly, reiterated his previous statement that the children had gone\nwith Miss Williams to England, and gave her address in London, 80 Veder\nor Vadar Street, where, he said, Miss Williams had opened a massage\nestablishment. He offered to draw up and insert a cipher advertisement\nin the New York Herald, by means of which, he said, Miss Williams and he\nhad agreed to communicate, and almost tearfully he added, \"Why should I\nkill innocent children?\"\n\nAsked to give the name of any person who had seen Miss Williams and the\nchildren in the course of their journeyings in America, he resented\nthe disbelief implied in such a question, and strong was his manly\nindignation when one of the gentlemen present expressed his opinion that\nthe story was a lie from beginning to end. This rude estimate of\nHolmes' veracity was, however, in some degree confirmed when a cipher\nadvertisement published in the New York Herald according to Holmes'\ndirections, produced no reply from Miss Williams, and inquiry showed\nthat no such street as Veder or Vadar Street was to be found in London.\n\nIn spite of these disappointments, Holmes' quiet confidence in his\nown good faith continued unshaken. When the hapless Mrs. Pitezel was\nreleased, he wrote her a long letter. \"Knowing me as you do,\" he said,\n\"can you imagine me killing little and innocent children, especially\nwithout any motive?\" But even Mrs. Pitezel was not wholly reassured. She\nrecollected how Holmes had taken her just before his arrest to a house\nhe had rented at Burlington, Vermont, how he had written asking her to\ncarry a package of nitro-glycerine from the bottom to the top of the\nhouse, and how one day she had found him busily removing the boards in\nthe cellar.\n\n\nII THE WANDERING ASSASSIN\n\n\nThe District Attorney and the Insurance Company were not in agreement\nas to the fate of the Pitezel children. The former still inclined to the\nhope and belief that they were in England with Miss Williams, but the\ninsurance company took a more sinister view. No trace of them existed\nexcept a tin box found among Holmes' effects, containing letters\nthey had written to their mother and grandparents from Cincinnati,\nIndianapolis, and Detroit, which had been given to Holmes to dispatch\nbut had never reached their destination. The box contained letters from\nMrs. Pitezel to her children, which Holmes had presumably intercepted.\n\nIt was decided to make a final attempt to resolve all doubts by sending\nan experienced detective over the route taken by the children in\nAmerica. He was to make exhaustive inquiries in each city with a view to\ntracing the visits of Holmes or the three children. For this purpose a\ndetective of the name of Geyer was chosen. The record of his search is a\nremarkable story of patient and persistent investigation.\n\nAlice Pitezel had not seen her mother since she had gone with Holmes\nto identify her father's remains in Philadelphia. From there Holmes had\ntaken her to Indianapolis. In the meantime he had visited Mrs. Pitezel\nat St. Louis, and taken away with him the girl, Nellie, and the boy,\nHoward, alleging as his reason for doing so that they and Alice were to\njoin their father, whose temporary effacement was necessary to carry out\nsuccessfully the fraud on the insurance company, to which Mrs. Pitezel\nhad been from the first an unwilling party. Holmes, Nellie and Howard\nhad joined Alice at Indianapolis, and from there all four were believed\nto have gone to Cincinnati. It was here, accordingly, on June 27, 1895,\nthat Geyer commenced his search.\n\nAfter calling at a number of hotels, Geyer found that on Friday,\nSeptember 28, 1894, a man, giving the name of Alexander E. Cook, and\nthree children had stayed at a hotel called the Atlantic House. Geyer\nrecollected that Holmes, when later on he had sent Mrs. Pitezel to the\nhouse in Burlington, had described her as Mrs. A. E. Cook and, though\nnot positive, the hotel clerk thought that he recognised in the\nphotographs of Holmes and he three children, which Geyer showed him, the\nfour visitors to the hotel.\n\nThey had left the Atlantic House the next day, and on that same day, the\n29th, Geyer found that Mr. A. E. Cook and three children had registered\nat the Bristol Hotel, where they had stayed until Sunday the 30th.\n\nKnowing Holmes' habit of renting houses, Geyer did not confine his\nenquiries to the hotels. He visited a number of estate agents and learnt\nthat a man and a boy, identified as Holmes and Howard Pitezel, had\noccupied a house No. 305 Poplar Street. The man had given the name of A.\nC. Hayes. He had taken the house on Friday the 28th, and on the 29th had\ndriven up to it with the boy in a furniture wagon. A curious neighbour,\ninterested in the advent of a newcomer, saw the wagon arrive, and was\nsomewhat astonished to observe that the only furniture taken into the\nhouse was a large iron cylinder stove. She was still further surprised\nwhen, on the following day, Mr. Hayes told her that he was not going\nafter all to occupy the house, and made her a present of the cylinder\nstove.\n\nFrom Cincinnati Geyer went to Indianapolis. Here inquiry showed that\non September 30 three children had been brought by a man identified as\nHolmes to the Hotel English, and registered in the name of Canning.\nThis was the maiden name of Mrs. Pitezel. The children had stayed at the\nhotel one night. After that Geyer seemed to lose track of them until he\nwas reminded of a hotel then closed, called the Circle House. With some\ndifficulty he got a sight of the books of the hotel, and found that the\nthree Canning children had arrived there on October 1 and stayed until\nthe 10th. From the former proprietor of the hotel he learnt that Holmes\nhad described himself as the children's uncle, and had said that Howard\nwas a bad boy, whom he was trying to place in some institution. The\nchildren seldom went out; they would sit in their room drawing or\nwriting, often they were found crying; they seemed homesick and unhappy.\n\nThere are letters of the children written from Indianapolis to their\nmothers, letters found in Holmes' possession, which had never reached\nher. In these letters they ask their mother why she does not write to\nthem. She had written, but her letters were in Holmes' possession. Alice\nwrites that she is reading \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" She has read so much\nthat her eyes hurt; they have bought a crystal pen for five cents which\ngives them some amusement; they had been to the Zoo in Cincinnati the\nSunday before: \"I expect this Sunday will pass away slower than I don't\nknow--Howard is two (sic) dirty to be seen out on the street to-day.\"\nSometimes they go and watch a man who paints \"genuine oil paintings\"\nin a shoe store, which are given away with every dollar purchase of\nshoes--\"he can paint a picture in one and a half minutes, ain't that\nquick!\" Howard was getting a little troublesome. \"I don't like to tell\nyou,\" writes Alice, \"but you ask me, so I will have to. Howard won't\nmind me at all. He wanted a book and I got 'Life of General Sheridan,'\nand it is awful nice, but now he don't read it at all hardly.\" Poor\nHoward! One morning, says Alice, Mr. Holmes told him to stay in and wait\nfor him, as he was coming to take him out, but Howard was disobedient,\nand when Mr. Holmes arrived he had gone out. Better for Howard had he\nnever returned! \"We have written two or three letters to you,\" Alice\ntells her mother, \"and I guess you will begin to get them now.\" She\nwill not get them. Mr. Holmes is so very particular that the insurance\ncompany shall get no clue to the whereabouts of any member of the\nPitezel family.\n\nGeyer knew that from Indianapolis Holmes had gone to Detroit. He\nascertained that two girls, \"Etta and Nellie Canning,\" had registered\non October 12 at the New Western Hotel in that city, and from there had\nmoved on the 15th to a boarding-house in Congress Street. From Detroit\nAlice had written to her grandparents. It was cold and wet, she wrote;\nshe and Etta had colds and chapped hands: \"We have to stay in all the\ntime. All that Nell and I can do is to draw, and I get so tired sitting\nthat I could get up and fly almost. I wish I could see you all. I am\ngetting so homesick that I don't know what to do. I suppose Wharton\n(their baby brother) walks by this time, don't he? I would like to have\nhim here, he would pass away the time a good deal.\" As a fact little\nWharton, his mother and sister Dessie, were at this very moment in\nDetroit, within ten minutes' walk of the hotel at which Holmes had\nregistered \"Etta and Nellie Canning.\"\n\nOn October 14 there had arrived in that city a weary, anxious-looking\nwoman, with a girl and a little baby. They took a room at Geis's Hotel,\nregistering as Mrs. Adams and daughter. Mrs. Adams seemed in great\ndistress of mind, and never left her room.\n\nThe housekeeper, being shown their photographs, identified the woman\nand the girl as Mrs. Pitezel and her eldest daughter Dessie. As the same\ntime there had been staying at another hotel in Detroit a Mr. and Mrs.\nHolmes, whose photographs showed them to be the Mr. Holmes in question\nand his third wife. These three parties--the two children, Mrs. Pitezel\nand her baby, and the third Mrs. Holmes--were all ignorant of each\nother's presence in Detroit; and under the secret guidance of Mr. Holmes\nthe three parties (still unaware of their proximity to each other), left\nDetroit for Canada, arriving in Toronto on or about October 18, and\nregistering at three separate hotels. The only one who had not to all\nappearances reached Toronto was the boy Howard.\n\nIn Toronto \"Alice and Nellie Canning\" stayed at the Albion Hotel.\n\nThey arrived there on October 19, and left on the 25th. During their\nstay a man, identified as Holmes, had called every morning for the two\nchildren, and taken them out; but they had come back alone, usually in\ntime for supper. On the 25th he had called and taken them out, but they\nhad not returned to supper. After that date Geyer could find no trace\nof them. Bearing in mind Holmes' custom of renting houses, he compiled a\nlist of all the house agents in Toronto, and laboriously applied to each\none for information. The process was a slow one, and the result seemed\nlikely to be disappointing.\n\nTo aid his search Geyer decided to call in the assistance of the Press.\nThe newspapers readily published long accounts of the case and portraits\nof Holmes and the children. At last, after eight days of patient and\nuntiring investigation, after following up more than one false clue,\nGeyer received a report that there was a house--No. 16 St. Vincent\nStreet--which had been rented in the previous October by a man answering\nto the description of Holmes. The information came from an old Scottish\ngentleman living next door. Geyer hastened to see him. The old gentleman\nsaid that the man who had occupied No. 16 in October had told him that\nhe had taken the house for his widowed sister, and he recognised the\nphotograph of Alice Pitezel as one of the two girls accompanying\nhim. The only furniture the man had taken into the house was a bed, a\nmattress and a trunk. During his stay at No. 16 this man had called on\nhis neighbour about four o'clock one afternoon and borrowed a spade,\nsaying that he wanted to dig a place in the cellar where his widowed\nsister could keep potatoes; he had returned the spade the following\nmorning. The lady to whom the house belonged recognised Holmes' portrait\nas that of the man to whom she had let No. 16.\n\nAt last Geyer seemed to be on the right track. He hurried back to St.\nVincent Street, borrowed from the old gentleman at No. 18 the very\nspade which he had lent to Holmes in the previous October, and got the\npermission of the present occupier of No. 16 to make a search. In the\ncentre of the kitchen Geyer found a trap-door leading down into a small\ncellar. In one corner of the cellar he saw that the earth had been\nrecently dug up. With the help of the spade the loose earth was removed,\nand at a depth of some three feet, in a state of advanced decomposition,\nlay the remains of what appeared to be two children. A little toy wooden\negg with a snake inside it, belonging to the Pitezel children, had been\nfound by the tenant who had taken the house after Holmes; a later tenant\nhad found stuffed into the chimney, but not burnt, some clothing that\nanswered the description of that worn by Alice and Etta Pitezel; and by\nthe teeth and hair of the two corpses Mrs. Pitezel was able to identify\nthem as those of her two daughters. The very day that Alice and Etta had\nmet their deaths at St. Vincent Street, their mother had been staying\nnear them at a hotel in the same city, and later on the same day Holmes\nhad persuaded her to leave Toronto for Ogdensburg. He said that they\nwere being watched by detectives, and so it would be impossible for her\nhusband to come to see her there.\n\nBut the problem was not yet wholly solved. What had become of Howard? So\nfar Geyer's search had shown that Holmes had rented three houses, one in\nCincinnati, one in Detroit, and one in Toronto. Howard had been with his\nsisters at the hotels in Indianapolis, and in Detroit the house agents\nhad said that, when Holmes had rented a house there, he had been\naccompanied by a boy. Yet an exhaustive search of that house had\nrevealed no trace of him. Geyer returned to Detroit and again questioned\nthe house agents; on being pressed their recollection of the boy who had\naccompanied Holmes seemed very vague and uncertain. This served only to\njustify a conclusion at which Geyer had already arrived, that Howard\nhad never reached Detroit, but had disappeared in Indianapolis. Alice's\nletters, written from there, had described how Holmes had wanted to take\nHoward out one day and how the boy had refused to stay in and wait for\nhim. In the same way Holmes had called for the two girls at the Albion\nHotel in Toronto on October 25 and taken them out with him, after which\nthey had never been seen alive except by the old gentleman at No. 18 St.\nVincent Street.\n\nIf Geyer could discover that Holmes had not departed in Indianapolis\nfrom his usual custom of renting houses, he might be on the high way\nto solving the mystery of Howard's fate. Accordingly he returned to\nIndianapolis.\n\nIn the meantime, Holmes, in his prison at Philadelphia, learnt of the\ndiscovery at Toronto. \"On the morning of the 16th of July,\" he writes\nin his journal, \"my newspaper was delivered to me about 8.30 a.m., and I\nhad hardly opened it before I saw in large headlines the announcement\nof the finding of the children in Toronto. For the moment it seemed\nso impossible that I was inclined to think it was one of the frequent\nnewspaper excitements that had attended the earlier part of the case,\nbut, in attempting to gain some accurate comprehension of what was\nstated in the article, I became convinced that at least certain bodies\nhad been found there, and upon comparing the date when the house was\nhired I knew it to be the same as when the children had been in Toronto;\nand thus being forced to realise the awfulness of what had probably\nhappened, I gave up trying to read the article, and saw instead the two\nlittle faces as they had looked when I hurriedly left them--felt the\ninnocent child's kiss so timidly given, and heard again their earnest\nwords of farewell, and realised that I had received another burden to\ncarry to my grave with me, equal, if not worse, than the horrors of\nNannie Williams' death.\"\n\nQuestioned by the district attorney, Holmes met this fresh evidence by\nevoking once again the mythical Edward Hatch and suggesting that Miss\nMinnie Williams, in a \"hellish wish for vengeance\" because of Holmes'\nfancied desertion, and in order to make it appear probable that he,\nand not she, had murdered her sister, had prompted Hatch to commit the\nhorrid deed. Holmes asked to be allowed to go to Toronto that he might\ncollect any evidence which he could find there in his favour. The\ndistrict attorney refused his request; he had determined to try Holmes\nin Philadelphia. \"What more could, be said?\" writes Holmes. Indeed,\nunder the circumstances, and in the unaccountable absence of Edward\nHatch and Minnie Williams, there was little more to be said.\n\nDetective Geyer reopened his search in Indianapolis by obtaining a list\nof advertisements of houses to let in the city in 1894. Nine hundred\nof these were followed up in vain. He then turned his attention to the\nsmall towns lying around Indianapolis with no happier result. Geyer\nwrote in something of despair to his superiors: \"By Monday we will\nhave searched every outlying town except Irvington. After Irvington, I\nscarcely know where we shall go.\" Thither he went on August 27, exactly\ntwo months from the day on which his quest had begun. As he entered the\ntown he noticed the advertisement of an estate agent. He called at\nthe office and found a \"pleasant-faced old gentleman,\" who greeted him\namiably. Once again Geyer opened his now soiled and ragged packet of\nphotographs, and asked the gentleman if in October, 1894, he had let\na house to a man who said that he wanted one for a widowed sister. He\nshowed him the portrait of Holmes.\n\nThe old man put on his glasses and looked at the photograph for some\ntime. Yes, he said, he did remember that he had given the keys of\na cottage in October, 1894, to a man of Holmes' appearance, and he\nrecollected the man the more distinctly for the uncivil abruptness with\nwhich he had asked for the keys; \"I felt,\" he said, \"he should have had\nmore respect for my grey hairs.\"\n\nFrom the old gentleman's office Geyer hastened to the cottage, and\nmade at once for the cellar. There he could find no sign of recent\ndisturbance. But beneath the floor of a piazza adjoining the house he\nfound the remains of a trunk, answering to the description of that which\nthe Pitezel children had had with them, and in an outhouse he discovered\nthe inevitable stove, Holmes' one indispensable piece of furniture. It\nwas stained with blood on the top. A neighbour had seen Holmes in the\nsame October drive up to the house in the furniture wagon accompanied\nby a boy, and later in the day Holmes had asked him to come over to the\ncottage and help him to put up a stove. The neighbour asked him why he\ndid not use gas; Holmes replied that he did not think gas was healthy\nfor children. While the two men were putting up the stove, the\nlittle boy stood by and watched them. After further search there were\ndiscovered in the cellar chimney some bones, teeth, a pelvis and the\nbaked remains of a stomach, liver and spleen.\n\nMedical examination showed them to be the remains of a child between\nseven and ten years of age. A spinning top, a scarf-pin, a pair of shoes\nand some articles of clothing that had belonged to the little Pitezels,\nhad been found in the house at different times, and were handed over to\nGeyer.\n\nHis search was ended. On September 1 he returned to Philadelphia.\n\nHolmes was put on his trial on October 28, 1895, before the Court of\nOyer and Terminer in Philadelphia, charged with the murder of Benjamin\nPitezel. In the course of the trial the district attorney offered to put\nin evidence showing that Holmes had also murdered the three children of\nPitezel, contending that such evidence was admissible on the ground\nthat the murders of the children and their father were parts of the same\ntransaction. The judge refused to admit the evidence, though expressing\na doubt as to its inadmissibility. The defence did not dispute the\nidentity of the body found in Callowhill Street, but contended that\nPitezel had committed suicide. The medical evidence negatived such a\ntheory. The position of the body, its condition when discovered,\nwere entirely inconsistent with self-destruction, and the absence of\nirritation in the stomach showed that the chloroform found there must\nhave been poured into it after death. In all probability, Holmes had\nchloroformed Pitezel when he was drunk or asleep. He had taken the\nchloroform to Callowhill Street as a proposed ingredient in a solution\nfor cleaning clothes, which he and Pitezel were to patent. It was no\ndoubt with the help of the same drug that he had done to death the\nlittle children, and failing the nitro-glycerine, with that drug he had\nintended to put Mrs. Pitezel and her two remaining children out of the\nway at the house in Burlington; for after his trial there was found\nthere, hidden away in the cellar, a bottle containing eight or ten\nounces of chloroform.\n\nThough assisted by counsel, Holmes took an active part in his defence.\nHe betrayed no feeling at the sight of Mrs. Pitezel, the greater part of\nwhose family he had destroyed, but the appearance of his third wife as a\nwitness he made an opportunity for \"letting loose the fount of emotion,\"\ntaking care to inform his counsel beforehand that he intended to perform\nthis touching feat. He was convicted and sentenced to death on November\n2.\n\nPrevious to the trial of Holmes the police had made an exhaustive\ninvestigation of the mysterious building in Chicago known as \"Holmes'\nCastle.\" The result was sufficiently sinister. In the stove in the\ncellar charred human bones were found, and in the middle of the room\nstood a large dissecting table stained with blood. On digging up the\ncellar floor some human ribs, sections of vertebrae and teeth were\ndiscovered buried in quicklime, and in other parts of the \"castle\" the\npolice found more charred bones, some metal buttons, a trunk, and a\npiece of a watch chain.\n\nThe trunk and piece of watch chain were identified as having belonged to\nMiss Minnie Williams.\n\nInquiry showed that Miss Williams had entered Holmes' employment as a\ntypist in 1893, and had lived with him at the castle. In the latter part\nof the year she had invited her sister, Nannie, to be present at her\nwedding with Holmes. Nannie had come to Chicago for that purpose, and\nsince then the two sisters had never been seen alive. In February in the\nfollowing year Pitezel, under the name of Lyman, had deposited at Fort\nWorth, Texas, a deed according to which a man named Bond had transferred\nto him property in that city which had belonged to Miss Williams, and\nshortly after, Holmes, under the name of Pratt, joined him at Fort\nWorth, whereupon the two commenced building on Miss Williams' land.\n\nOther mysterious cases besides those of the Williams sisters revealed\nthe Bluebeard-like character of this latterday castle of Mr. Holmes. In\n1887 a man of the name of Connor entered Holmes' employment. He brought\nwith him to the castle a handsome, intelligent wife and a little girl of\neight or nine years of age.\n\nAfter a short time Connor quarrelled with his wife and went away,\nleaving Mrs. Connor and the little girl with Holmes. After 1892 Mrs.\nConnor and her daughter had disappeared, but in August, 1895, the police\nfound in the castle some clothes identified as theirs, and the janitor,\nQuinlan, admitted having seen the dead body of Mrs. Connor in the\ncastle. Holmes, questioned in his prison in Philadelphia, said that Mrs.\nConnor had died under an operation, but that he did not know what had\nbecome of the little girl.\n\nIn the year of Mrs. Connor's disappearance, a typist named Emily\nCigrand, who had been employed in a hospital in which Benjamin Pitezel\nhad been a patient, was recommended by the latter to Holmes. She entered\nhis employment, and she and Holmes soon became intimate, passing as\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Gordon.\" Emily Cigrand had been in the habit of writing\nregularly to her parents in Indiana, but after December 6, 1892, they\nhad never heard from her again, nor could any further trace of her be\nfound.\n\nA man who worked for Holmes as a handy man at the castle stated to the\npolice that in 1892 Holmes had given him a skeleton of a man to mount,\nand in January, 1893, showed him in the laboratory another male skeleton\nwith some flesh still on it, which also he asked him to mount. As there\nwas a set of surgical instruments in the laboratory and also a tank\nfilled with a fluid preparation for removing flesh, the handy man\nthought that Holmes was engaged in some kind of surgical work.\n\nAbout a month before his execution, when Holmes' appeals from his\nsentence had failed and death appeared imminent, he sold to the\nnewspapers for 7,500 dollars a confession in which he claimed to have\ncommitted twenty-seven murders in the course of his career. The day\nafter it appeared he declared the whole confession to be a \"fake.\"\nHe was tired, he said, of being accused by the newspapers of having\ncommitted every mysterious murder that had occurred during the last\nten years. When it was pointed out to him that the account given in his\nconfession of the murder of the Pitezel children was clearly untrue,\nhe replied, \"Of course, it is not true, but the newspapers wanted\na sensation and they have got it.\" The confession was certainly\nsensational enough to satisfy the most exacting of penny-a-liners, and a\nlasting tribute to Holmes' undoubted power of extravagant romancing.\n\nAccording to his story, some of his twenty-seven victims had met their\ndeath by poison, some by more violent methods, some had died a lingering\ndeath in the air-tight and sound-proof vault of the castle. Most of\nthese he mentioned by name, but some of these were proved afterwards to\nbe alive. Holmes had actually perpetrated, in all probability, about ten\nmurders. But, given further time and opportunity, there is no reason why\nthis peripatetic assassin should not have attained to the considerable\nfigure with which he credited himself in his bogus confession.\n\nHolmes was executed in Philadelphia on May 7, 1896. He seemed to meet\nhis fate with indifference.\n\nThe motive of Holmes in murdering Pitezel and three of his children and\nin planning to murder his wife and remaining children, originated in all\nprobability in a quarrel that occurred between Pitezel and himself in\nthe July of 1894. Pitezel had tired apparently of Holmes and his doings,\nand wanted to break off the connection. But he must have known enough\nof Holmes' past to make him a dangerous enemy. It was Pitezel who had\nintroduced to Holmes, Emily Cigrand, the typist, who had disappeared\nso mysteriously in the castle; Pitezel had been his partner in the\nfraudulent appropriation of Miss Minnie Williams' property in Texas; it\nis more than likely, therefore, that Pitezel knew something of the fate\nof Miss Williams and her sister. By reviving, with Pitezel's help, his\nold plan for defrauding insurance companies, Holmes saw the opportunity\nof making 10,000 dollars, which he needed sorely, and at the same time\nremoving his inconvenient and now lukewarm associate. Having killed\nPitezel and received the insurance money, Holmes appropriated to his\nown use the greater part of the 10,000 dollars, giving Mrs. Pitezel\nin return for her share of the plunder a bogus bill for 5,000 dollars.\nHaving robbed Mrs. Pitezel of both her husband and her money, to\nthis thoroughgoing criminal there seemed only one satisfactory way of\nescaping detection, and that was to exterminate her and the whole of her\nfamily.\n\nHad Holmes not confided his scheme of the insurance fraud to Hedgspeth\nin St. Louis prison and then broken faith with him, there is no reason\nwhy the fraud should ever have been discovered. The subsequent murders\nhad been so cunningly contrived that, had the Insurance Company not put\nthe Pinkerton detectives on his track, Holmes would in all probability\nhave ended by successfully disposing of Mrs. Pitezel, Dessie, and the\nbaby at the house in Burlington, Vermont, and the entire Pitezel family\nwould have disappeared as completely as his other victims.\n\nHolmes admitted afterwards that his one mistake had been his confiding\nto Hedgspeth his plans for defrauding an insurance company--a mistake,\nthe unfortunate results of which might have been avoided, if he had kept\nfaith with the train robber and given him the 500 dollars which he had\npromised.\n\nThe case of Holmes illustrates the practical as well as the purely\nethical value of \"honour among thieves,\" and shows how a comparatively\ninsignificant misdeed may ruin a great and comprehensive plan of crime.\nTo dare to attempt the extermination of a family of seven persons, and\nto succeed so nearly in effecting it, could be the work of no tyro, no\nbeginner like J. B. Troppmann. It was the act of one who having\nalready succeeded in putting out of the way a number of other persons\nundetected, might well and justifiably believe that he was born for\ngreater and more compendious achievements in robbery and murder than\nany who had gone before him. One can almost subscribe to America's claim\nthat Holmes is the \"greatest criminal\" of a century boasting no mean\nrecord in such persons.\n\nIn the remarkable character of his achievements as an assassin we are\napt to lose sight of Holmes' singular skill and daring as a liar and\na bigamist. As an instance of the former may be cited his audacious\nexplanation to his family, when they heard of his having married a\nsecond time. He said that he had met with a serious accident to his\nhead, and that when he left the hospital, found that he had entirely\nlost his memory; that, while in this state of oblivion, he had married\nagain and then, when his memory returned, realised to his horror his\nunfortunate position. Plausibility would seem to have been one of\nHolmes' most useful gifts; men and women alike--particularly the\nlatter--he seems to have deceived with ease. His appearance was\ncommonplace, in no way suggesting the conventional criminal, his\nmanner courteous, ingratiating and seemingly candid, and like so many\nscoundrels, he could play consummately the man of sentiment.\n\nThe weak spot in Holmes' armour as an enemy of society was a dangerous\ntendency to loquacity, the defect no doubt of his qualities of plausible\nand insinuating address and ever ready mendacity.\n\n\n\n\nThe Widow Gras\n\n\nReport of the trial of the woman Gras and Gaudry in the Gazette\ndes Tribunaux. The case is dealt with also by Mace in his \"Femmes\nCriminelles.\"\n\nI\n\nTHE CHARMER\n\nJenny Amenaide Brecourt was born in Paris in the year 1837. Her father\nwas a printer, her mother sold vegetables. The parents neglected the\nchild, but a lady of title took pity on her, and when she was five years\nold adopted her. Even as a little girl she was haughty and imperious. At\nthe age of eight she refused to play with another child on the ground\nof her companion's social inferiority. \"The daughter of a Baroness,\" she\nsaid, \"cannot play with the daughter of a wine-merchant.\" When she was\neleven years old, her parents took her away from her protectress and\nsent her into the streets to sell gingerbread--a dangerous experience\nfor a child of tender years. After six years of street life, Amenaide\nsought out her benefactress and begged her to take her back. The\nBaroness consented, and found her employment in a silk manufactory. One\nday the girl, now eighteen years old, attended the wedding of one of\nher companions in the factory. She returned home after the ceremony\nthoughtful.\n\nShe said that she wanted to get married. The Baroness did not take her\nstatement seriously, and on the grocer calling one day, said in jest to\nAmenaide, \"You want a husband, there's one.\"\n\nBut Amenaide was in earnest. She accepted the suggestion and, to the\nBaroness' surprise, insisted on taking the grocer as her husband.\nReluctantly the good lady gave her consent, and in 1855 Amenaide\nBrecourt became the wife of the grocer Gras.\n\nA union, so hasty and ill-considered, was not likely to be of long\nduration. With the help of the worthy Baroness the newly married couple\nstarted a grocery business. But Amenaide was too economical for her\nhusband and mother-in-law. Quarrels ensued, recriminations. In a spirit\nof unamiable prophecy husband and wife foretold each other's future.\n\"You will die in a hospital,\" said the wife. \"You will land your carcase\nin prison,\" retorted the husband. In both instances they were correct in\ntheir anticipations. One day the husband disappeared. For a short time\nAmenaide returned to her long-suffering protectress, and then she too\ndisappeared.\n\nWhen she is heard of again, Amenaide Brecourt has become Jeanne de la\nCour. Jeanne de la Cour is a courtesan. She has tried commerce, acting,\nliterature, journalism, and failed at them all. Henceforth men are\nto make her fortune for her. Such charms as she may possess, such\nallurements as she can offer, she is ready to employ without heart or\nfeeling to accomplish her end. Without real passion, she has an almost\nabnormal, erotic sensibility, which serves in its stead. She cares\nonly for one person, her sister. To her Jeanne de la Cour unfolded her\nphilosophy of life. While pretending to love men, she is going to make\nthem suffer. They are to be her playthings, she knows how to snare them:\n\"All is dust and lies. So much the worse for the men who get in my way.\nMen are mere stepping-stones to me. As soon as they begin to fail or are\nplayed out, I put them scornfully aside. Society is a vast chess-board,\nmen the pawns, some white, some black; I move them as I please, and\nbreak them when they bore me.\"\n\nThe early years of Jeanne de la Cour's career as a Phryne were hardly\nmore successful than her attempts at literature, acting and journalism.\nTrue to her philosophy, she had driven one lover, a German, to suicide,\nand brought another to his death by over-doses of cantharides. On\nlearning of the death of the first, she reflected patriotically,\n\"One German the less in Paris!\" That of the second elicited the\nmatter-of-fact comment, \"It was bound to happen; he had no moderation.\"\nA third admirer, who died in a hospital, was dismissed as \"a fool who,\nin spite of all, still respects women.\" But, in ruining her lovers, she\nhad ruined her own health. In 1865 she was compelled to enter a private\nasylum. There she is described as \"dark in complexion, with dark\nexpressive eyes, very pale, and of a nervous temperament, agreeable, and\npretty.\" She was suffering at the time of her admission from hysterical\nseizures, accompanied by insane exaltation, convulsions and loss of\nspeech. In speaking of her humble parents she said, \"I don't know such\npeople\"; her manner was bombastic, and she was fond of posing as a fine\nlady.\n\nAfter a few months Jeanne de la Cour was discharged from the asylum as\ncured, and on the advice of her doctors went to Vittel.\n\nThere she assumed the rank of Baroness and recommenced her career, but\nthis time in a more reasonable and businesslike manner. Her comments,\nwritten to her sister, on her fellow guests at the hotel are caustic.\nShe mocks at some respectable married women who are trying to convert\nher to Catholicism. To others who refuse her recognition, she makes\nherself so mischievous and objectionable that in self-defence they are\nfrightened into acknowledging her. Admirers among men she has many,\nex-ministers, prefects. It was at Vittel that occurred the incident\nof the wounded pigeon. There had been some pigeon-shooting. One of the\nwounded birds flew into the room of the Baroness de la Cour. She took\npity on it, tended it, taught it not to be afraid of her and to stay in\nher room. So touching was her conduct considered by some of those who\nheard it, that she was nicknamed \"the Charmer.\" But she is well aware,\nshe writes to her sister, that with the true ingratitude of the male,\nthe pigeon will leave her as soon as it needs her help no longer.\n\nHowever, for the moment, \"disfigured as it is, beautiful or ugly,\" she\nloves it. \"Don't forget,\" she writes, \"that a woman who is practical and\nforeseeing, she too enjoys her pigeon shooting, but the birds are her\nlovers.\"\n\nShortly after she left Vittel an event occurred which afforded Jeanne de\nla Cour the prospect of acquiring that settled position in life which,\n\"practical and foreseeing,\" she now regarded as indispensable to her\nfuture welfare. Her husband, Gras, died, as she had foretold, in the\nCharity Hospital. The widow was free. If she could bring down her bird,\nit was now in her power to make it hers for life. Henceforth all her\nefforts were directed to that end. She was reaching her fortieth year,\nher hair was turning grey, her charms were waning. Poverty, degradation,\na miserable old age, a return to the wretched surroundings of her\nchildhood, such she knew to be the fate of many of her kind. There was\nnothing to be hoped for from the generosity of men. Her lovers were\nleaving her. Blackmail, speculation on the Bourse, even the desperate\nexpedient of a supposititious child, all these she tried as means of\nacquiring a competence. But fortune was shy of the widow. There was\nneed for dispatch. The time was drawing near when it might be man's\nunkind privilege to put her scornfully aside as a thing spent and done\nwith. She must bring down her bird, and that quickly. It was at this\ncritical point in the widow's career, in the year 1873, that she met at\na public ball for the first time Georges de Saint Pierre.(16)\n\n\n     (16) For obvious reasons I have suppressed the real name of the widow's\nlover.\n\n\nGeorges de Saint Pierre was twenty years of age when he made the\nacquaintance of the Widow Gras. He had lost his mother at an early age,\nand since then lived with relatives in the country. He was a young man\nof independent means, idle, of a simple, confiding and affectionate\ndisposition. Four months after his first meeting with the widow they\nmet again. The end of the year 1873 saw the commencement of an intimacy,\nwhich to all appearances was characterised by a more lasting and sincere\naffection than is usually associated with unions of this kind. There can\nbe no doubt that during the three years the Widow Gras was the mistress\nof Georges de Saint Pierre, she had succeeded in subjugating entirely\nthe senses and the affection of her young lover. In spite of the twenty\nyears between them, Georges de Saint Pierre idolised his middle-aged\nmistress. She was astute enough to play not only the lover, but the\nmother to this motherless youth. After three years of intimacy he writes\nto her: \"It is enough for me that you love me, because I don't weary\nyou, and I, I love you with all my heart. I cannot bear to leave you.\nWe will live happily together. You will always love me truly, and as for\nme, my loving care will ever protect you. I don't know what would become\nof me if I did not feel that your love watched over me.\" The confidence\nof Georges in the widow was absolute. When, in 1876, he spent six months\nin Egypt, he made her free of his rooms in Paris, she was at liberty to\ngo there when she liked; he trusted her entirely, idolised her. Whatever\nher faults, he was blind to them. \"Your form,\" he writes, \"is ever\nbefore my eyes; I wish I could enshrine your pure heart in gold and\ncrystal.\"\n\nThe widow's conquest, to all appearances, was complete. But Georges was\nvery young. He had a family anxious for his future; they knew of his\nliaison; they would be hopeful, no doubt, of one day breaking it off and\nof marrying him to some desirable young person. From the widow's point\nof view the situation lacked finality. How was that to be secured?\n\nOne day, toward the end of the year 1876, after the return of Georges\nfrom Egypt, the widow happened to be at the house of a friend, a ballet\ndancer. She saw her friend lead into the room a young man; he was\nsightless, and her friend with tender care guided him to a seat on the\nsofa. The widow was touched by the spectacle. When they were alone, she\ninquired of her friend the reason of her solicitude for the young man.\n\"I love this victim of nature,\" she replied, \"and look after him with\nevery care. He is young, rich, without family, and is going to marry\nme. Like you, I am just on forty; my hair is turning grey, my youth\nvanishing. I shall soon be cast adrift on the sea, a wreck. This boy is\nthe providential spar to which I am going to cling that I may reach land\nin safety.\" \"You mean, then,\" said the widow, \"that you will soon be\nbeyond the reach of want?\" \"Yes,\" answered the friend, \"I needn't worry\nany more about the future.\"\n\n\"I congratulate you,\" said the widow, \"and what is more, your lover will\nnever see you grow old.\"\n\nTo be cast adrift on the sea and to have found a providential spar! The\nwidow was greatly impressed by her friend's rare good fortune. Indeed,\nher experience gave the widow furiously to think, as she revolved in her\nbrain various expedients by which Georges de Saint Pierre might become\nthe \"providential spar\" in her own impending wreck. The picture of\nthe blind young man tenderly cared for, dependent utterly on the\nministrations of his devoted wife, fixed itself in the widow's mind;\nthere was something inexpressibly pathetic in the picture, whilst its\npractical significance had its sinister appeal to one in her situation.\n\nAt this point in the story there appears on the scene a character as\nremarkable in his way as the widow herself, remarkable at least for\nhis share in the drama that is to follow. Nathalis Gaudry, of humble\nparentage, rude and uncultivated, had been a playmate of the widow when\nshe was a child in her parents' house.\n\nThey had grown up together, but, after Gaudry entered the army, had\nlost sight of each other. Gaudry served through the Italian war of 1859,\ngaining a medal for valour. In 1864 he had married.\n\nEleven years later his wife died, leaving him with two children. He came\nto Paris and obtained employment in an oil refinery at Saint Denis. His\ncharacter was excellent; he was a good workman, honest, hard-working,\nhis record unblemished. When he returned to Paris, Gaudry renewed his\nfriendship with the companion of his youth. But Jeanne Brecourt was now\nJeanne de la Cour, living in refinement and some luxury, moving in a\nsphere altogether remote from and unapproachable by the humble workman\nin an oil refinery. He could do no more than worship from afar\nthis strange being, to him wonderfully seductive in her charm and\ndistinction.\n\nOn her side the widow was quite friendly toward her homely admirer.\nShe refused to marry him, as he would have wished, but she did her best\nwithout success to marry him to others of her acquaintance. Neither a\nsempstress nor an inferior actress could she persuade, for all her\nzeal, to unite themselves with a hand in an oil mill, a widower with two\nchildren. It is typical of the widow's nervous energy that she should\nhave undertaken so hopeless a task. In the meantime she made use of\nher admirer. On Sundays he helped her in her apartment, carried coals,\nbottled wine, scrubbed the floors, and made himself generally useful. He\nwas supposed by those about the house to be her brother. Occasionally,\nin the absence of a maid, the widow allowed him to attend on her\npersonally, even to assist her in her toilette and perform for her such\noffices as one woman would perform for another. The man soon came to be\nmadly in love with the woman; his passion, excited but not gratified,\nenslaved and consumed him. To some of his fellow-workmen who saw him\nmoody and preoccupied, he confessed that he ardently desired to marry a\nfriend of his childhood, not a working woman but a lady.\n\nSuch was the situation and state of mind of Nathalis Gaudry when, in\nNovember, 1876, he received a letter from the widow, in which she wrote,\n\"Come at once. I want you on a matter of business. Tell your employer\nit is a family affair; I will make up your wages.\" In obedience to this\nmessage Gaudry was absent from the distillery from the 17th to the 23rd\nof November.\n\nThe \"matter of business\" about which the widow wished to consult with\nGaudry turned out to be a scheme of revenge. She told him that she had\nbeen basely defrauded by a man to whom she had entrusted money. She\ndesired to be revenged on him, and could think of no better way than to\nstrike at his dearest affections by seriously injuring his son. This she\nproposed to do with the help of a knuckle-duster, which she produced and\ngave to Gaudry. Armed with this formidable weapon, Gaudry was to strike\nher enemy's son so forcibly in the pit of the stomach as to disable him\nfor life. The widow offered to point out to Gaudry the young man whom he\nwas to attack. She took him outside the young man's club and showed him\nhis victim. He was Georges de Saint Pierre.\n\nThe good fortune of her friend, the ballet-dancer, had proved a\nveritable toxin in the intellectual system of the Widow Gras. The poison\nof envy, disappointment, suspicion, apprehension had entered into her\nsoul. Of what use to her was a lover, however generous and faithful,\nwho was free to take her up and lay her aside at will? But such was her\nsituation relative to Georges de Saint Pierre. She remembered that the\nwounded pigeon, as long as it was dependent on her kind offices, had\nbeen compelled to stay by her side; recovered, it had flown away. Only a\npigeon, maimed beyond hope of recovery, could she be sure of compelling\nto be hers for all time, tied to her by its helpless infirmity, too\nsuffering and disfigured to be lured from its captivity. And so, in\naccordance with her philosophy of life, the widow, by a blow in the pit\nof the stomach with a knuckle-duster, was to bring down her bird which\nhenceforth would be tended and cared for by \"the Charmer\" to her own\nsatisfaction and the admiration of all beholders.\n\nFor some reason, the natural reluctance of Gaudry, or perhaps a feeling\nof compunction in the heart of the widow, this plan was not put into\nimmediate execution. Possibly she hesitated before adopting a plan more\ncruel, more efficacious. Her hesitation did not last long.\n\nWith the dawn of the year 1877 the vigilant apprehension of the widow\nwas roused by the tone of M. de Saint Pierre's letters. He wrote from\nhis home in the country, \"I cannot bear leaving you, and I don't\nmean to. We will live together.\" But he adds that he is depressed by\ndifficulties with his family, \"not about money or business but of a kind\nhe can only communicate to her verbally.\" To the widow it was clear that\nthese difficulties must relate to the subject of marriage. The character\nof Georges was not a strong one; sooner or later he might yield to the\nimportunities of his family; her reign would be ended, a modest and\ninsufficient pension the utmost she could hope for. She had passed the\nmeridian of her life as a charmer of men, her health was giving way, she\nwas greedy, ambitious, acquisitive. In January she asked her nephew, who\nworked as a gilder, to get her some vitriol for cleaning her copper. He\ncomplied with her request.\n\nDuring Jeanne de la Cour's brief and unsuccessful appearance as an\nactress she had taken part in a play with the rather cumbrous title, Who\nPuts out the Eyes must Pay for Them. The widow may have forgotten\nthis event; its occurrence so many years before may have been merely\na sinister coincidence. But the incident of the ballet-dancer and her\nsightless lover was fresh in her mind.\n\nEarly in January the widow wrote to Georges, who was in the country, and\nasked him to take her to the masked ball at the Opera on the 13th. Her\nlover was rather surprised at her request, nor did he wish to appear\nwith her at so public a gathering. \"I don't understand,\" he writes, \"why\nyou are so anxious to go to the Opera. I can't see any real reason for\nyour wanting to tire yourself out at such a disreputable gathering.\nHowever, if you are happy and well, and promise to be careful, I will\ntake you. I would be the last person, my dear little wife, to deny you\nanything that would give you pleasure.\" But for some reason Georges was\nunhappy, depressed. Some undefined presentiment of evil seems to have\noppressed him. His brother noticed his preoccupation.\n\nHe himself alludes to it in writing to his mistress: \"I am depressed\nthis evening. For a very little I could break down altogether and give\nway to tears. You can't imagine what horrid thoughts possess me. If I\nfelt your love close to me, I should be less sad.\" Against his better\ninclination Georges promised to take the widow to the ball on the 13th.\nHe was to come to Paris on the night of the 12th.\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE WOUNDED PIGEON\n\n\nOn the afternoon of January 11, Gaudry called to see the widow. There\nhad been an accident at the distillery that morning, and work was\nsuspended for three days. The widow showed Gaudry the bottle containing\nthe vitriol which her nephew had procured for her use. She was ill,\nsuffering, she said; the only thing that could make her well again would\nbe the execution of her revenge on the son of the man who had defrauded\nher so wickedly: \"Make him suffer, here are the means, and I swear I\nwill be yours.\" She dropped a little of the vitriol on to the floor to\nshow its virulent effect. At first Gaudry was shocked, horrified. He\nprotested that he was a soldier, that he could not do such a deed; he\nsuggested that he should provoke the young man to a duel and kill\nhim. \"That is no use,\" said the widow, always sensitive to social\ndistinctions; \"he is not of your class, he would refuse to fight with\nyou.\" Mad with desire for the woman, his senses irritated and excited,\nthe ultimate gratification of his passion held alluringly before him,\nthe honest soldier consented to play the cowardly ruffian. The trick was\ndone. The widow explained to her accomplice his method of proceeding.\nThe building in the Rue de Boulogne, in which the widow had her\napartment, stood at the end of a drive some twenty-seven and a half\nyards long and five and a half yards wide. About half-way up the drive,\non either side, there were two small houses, or pavilions, standing by\nthemselves and occupied by single gentlemen. The whole was shut off from\nthe street by a large gate, generally kept closed, in which a smaller\ngate served to admit persons going in or out. According to the widow's\nplan, the young man, her enemy's son, was to take her to the ball at the\nOpera on the night of January 13. Gaudry was to wait in her apartment\nuntil their return. When he heard the bell ring, which communicated with\nthe outer gate, he was to come down, take his place in the shadow of one\nof the pavilions on either side of the drive, and from the cover of this\nposition fling in the face of the young man the vitriol which she had\ngiven him. The widow herself, under the pretence of closing the smaller\ngate, would be well behind the victim, and take care to leave the gate\nopen so that Gaudry could make his escape.\n\nIn spite of his reluctance, his sense of foreboding, Georges de Saint\nPierre came to Paris on the night of the 12th, which he spent at the\nwidow's apartment. He went to his own rooms on the morning of the 13th.\n\nThis eventful day, which, to quote Iago, was either to \"make or\nfordo quite\" the widow, found her as calm, cool and deliberate in the\nexecution of her purpose as the Ancient himself. Gaudry came to her\napartment about five o'clock in the afternoon. The widow showed him the\nvitriol and gave him final directions. She would, she said, return from\nthe ball about three o'clock in the morning. Gaudry was then sent\naway till ten o'clock, as Georges was dining with her. He returned at\nhalf-past ten and found the widow dressing, arraying herself in a pink\ndomino and a blonde wig. She was in excellent spirits. When Georges came\nto fetch her, she put Gaudry into an alcove in the drawing-room which\nwas curtained off from the rest of the room. Always thoughtful, she had\nplaced a stool there that he might rest himself. Gaudry could hear her\nlaughing and joking with her lover. She reproached him playfully with\nhindering her in her dressing. To keep him quiet, she gave him a book to\nread, Montaigne's \"Essays.\" Georges opened it and read the thirty-fifth\nchapter of the second book, the essay on \"Three Good Women,\" which tells\nhow three brave women of antiquity endured death or suffering in order\nto share their husbands' fate. Curiously enough, the essay concludes\nwith these words, almost prophetic for the unhappy reader: \"I am\nenforced to live, and sometimes to live is magnanimity.\" Whilst Georges\nwent to fetch a cab, the widow released Gaudry from his place of\nconcealment, exhorted him to have courage, and promised him, if he\nsucceeded, the accomplishment of his desire. And so the gay couple\ndeparted for the ball. There the widow's high spirits, her complete\nenjoyment, were remarked by more than one of her acquaintances; she\ndanced one dance with her lover, and with another young man made an\nengagement for the following week.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Rue de Boulogne, Gaudry sat and waited in the widow's\nbedroom. From the window he could see the gate and the lights of the cab\nthat was to bring the revellers home. The hours passed slowly. He tried\nto read the volume of Montaigne where Georges had left it open, but the\nwords conveyed little to him, and he fell asleep. Between two and three\no'clock in the morning he was waked by the noise of wheels. They had\nreturned. He hurried downstairs and took up his position in the shadow\nof one of the pavilions. As Georges de Saint Pierre walked up the drive\nalone, for the widow had stayed behind to fasten the gate, he thought he\nsaw the figure of a man in the darkness. The next moment he was blinded\nby the burning liquid flung in his face. The widow had brought down her\npigeon.\n\nAt first she would seem to have succeeded perfectly in her attempt.\nGeorges was injured for life, the sight of one eye gone, that of the\nother threatened, his face sadly disfigured. Neither he nor anyone\nelse suspected the real author of the crime. It was believed that the\nunfortunate man had been mistaken for some other person, and made by\naccident the victim of an act of vengeance directed against another.\nGeorges was indeed all the widow's now, lodged in her own house to\nnurse and care for. She undertook the duty with every appearance of\naffectionate devotion. The unhappy patient was consumed with gratitude\nfor her untiring solicitude; thirty nights she spent by his bedside. His\nbelief in her was absolute. It was his own wish that she alone should\nnurse him. His family were kept away, any attempts his relatives or\nfriends made to see or communicate with him frustrated by the zealous\nwidow.\n\nIt was this uncompromising attitude on her part toward the friends of\nGeorges, and a rumour which reached the ears of one of them that she\nintended as soon as possible to take her patient away to Italy, that\nsounded the first note of danger to her peace of mind. This friend\nhappened to be acquainted with the son of one of the Deputy Public\nProsecutors in Paris. To that official he confided his belief that there\nwere suspicious circumstances in the case of Georges de Saint Pierre.\nThe judicial authorities were informed and the case placed in the hands\nof an examining magistrate. On February 2, nearly a month after the\ncrime, the magistrate, accompanied by Mace, then a commissary of police,\nafterwards head of the Detective Department, paid a visit to the Rue de\nBoulogne. Their reception was not cordial. It was only after they had\nmade known their official character that they got audience of the widow.\nShe entered the room, carrying in her hand a surgical spray, with which\nshe played nervously while the men of the law asked to see her charge.\nShe replied that it was impossible. Mace placed himself in front of the\ndoor by which she had entered, and told her that her attitude was not\nseemly. \"Leave that spray alone,\" he said; \"it might shoot over us, and\nthen perhaps we should be sprinkled as M. de Saint Pierre was.\" From\nthat moment, writes Mace, issue was joined between the widow and\nhimself.\n\nThe magistrate insisted on seeing the patient. He sat by his bedside.\nM. de Saint Pierre told him that, having no enemies, he was sure he had\nbeen the victim of some mistake, and that, as he claimed no damages\nfor his injuries, he did not wish his misfortune to be made public.\nHe wanted to be left alone with his brave and devoted nurse, and to be\nspared the nervous excitement of a meeting with his family. He intended,\nhe added, to leave Paris shortly for change of scene and air. The widow\ncut short the interview on the ground that her patient was tired.\n\nIt was inhuman, she said, to make him suffer so. The magistrate, before\nleaving, asked her whither she intended taking her patient. She replied,\n\"To Italy.\" That, said the magistrate, would be impossible until his\ninquiry was closed. In the meantime she might take him to any place\nwithin the Department of the Seine; but she must be prepared to be under\nthe surveillance of M. Mace, who would have the right to enter her\nhouse whenever he should think it expedient. With this disconcerting\nintelligence the men of the law took leave of the widow.\n\nShe was no longer to be left in undisturbed possession of her prize.\nHer movements were watched by two detectives. She was seen to go to\nthe bachelor lodgings of Georges and take away a portable desk, which\ncontained money and correspondence. More mysterious, however, was a\nvisit she paid to the Charonne Cemetery, where she had an interview with\nan unknown, who was dressed in the clothes of a workman. She left the\ncemetery alone, and the detectives lost track of her companion. This\nmeeting took place on February 11. Shortly after the widow left Paris\nwith Georges de Saint Pierre for the suburb of Courbevoie.\n\nMace had elicited certain facts from the porter at the Rue de Boulogne\nand other witnesses, which confirmed his suspicion that the widow had\nplayed a sinister part in her lover's misfortune. Her insistence that\nhe should take her to the ball on January 13; the fact that, contrary to\nthe ordinary politeness of a gentleman, he was walking in front of her\nat the time of the attack; and that someone must have been holding the\ngate open to enable the assailant to escape it was a heavy gate, which,\nif left to itself after being opened, would swing too quickly on its\nhinges and shut of its own accord--these facts were sufficient to\nexcite suspicion. The disappearance, too, of the man calling himself\nher brother, who had been seen at her apartment on the afternoon of the\n13th, coupled with the mysterious interview in the cemetery, suggested\nthe possibility of a crime in which the widow had had the help of an\naccomplice. To facilitate investigation it was necessary to separate the\nwidow from her lover. The examining magistrate, having ascertained from\na medical report that such a separation would not be hurtful to the\npatient, ordered the widow to be sent back to Paris, and the family of\nM. de Saint Pierre to take her place. The change was made on March 6. On\nleaving Courbevoie the widow was taken to the office of Mace. There the\ncommissary informed her that she must consider herself under provisional\narrest. \"But who,\" she asked indignantly, \"is to look after my Georges?\"\n\"His family,\" was the curt reply. The widow, walking up and down the\nroom like a panther, stormed and threatened. When she had in some\ndegree recovered herself, Mace asked her certain questions. Why had she\ninsisted on her lover going to the ball? She had done nothing of the\nkind. How was it his assailant had got away so quickly by the open gate?\nShe did not know. What was the name and address of her reputed brother?\nShe was not going to deliver an honest father of a family into the\nclutches of the police. What was the meaning of her visit to the\nCharonne Cemetery? She went there to pray, not to keep assignations.\n\"And if you want to know,\" she exclaimed, \"I have had typhoid\nfever, which makes me often forget things. So I shall say nothing\nmore--nothing--nothing.\"\n\nTaken before the examining magistrate, her attitude continued to\nbe defiant and arrogant. \"Your cleverest policemen,\" she told the\nmagistrate, \"will never find any evidence against me. Think well before\nyou send me to prison. I am not the woman to live long among thieves and\nprostitutes.\" Before deciding finally whether the widow should be thrown\ninto such uncongenial society, the magistrate ordered Mace to search her\napartment in the Rue de Boulogne.\n\nOn entering the apartment the widow asked that all the windows should be\nopened. \"Let in the air,\" she said; \"the police are coming in; they\nmake a nasty smell.\" She was invited to sit down while the officers\nmade their search. Her letters and papers were carefully examined;\nthey presented a strange mixture of order and disorder. Carefully kept\naccount books of her personal expenses were mixed up with billets\ndous, paints and pomades, moneylenders' circulars, belladonna and\ncantharides. But most astounding of all were the contents of the widows'\nprie-Dieu. In this devotional article of furniture were stored all the\ninmost secrets of her profligate career. Affectionate letters from the\nelderly gentleman on whom she had imposed a supposititious child lay\nside by side with a black-edged card, on which was written the last\nmessage of a young lover who had killed himself on her account. \"Jeanne,\nin the flush of my youth I die because of you, but I forgive you.--M.\"\nWith these genuine outpourings of misplaced affection were mingled the\nindecent verses of a more vulgar admirer, and little jars of hashish.\nThe widow, unmoved by this rude exposure of her way of life, only broke\nher silence to ask Mace the current prices on the Stock Exchange.\n\nOne discovery, however, disturbed her equanimity. In the drawer of a\ncupboard, hidden under some linen, Mace found a leather case containing\na sheaf of partially-burnt letters. As he was about to open it the widow\nprotested that it was the property of M. de Saint Pierre. Regardless of\nher protest, Mace opened the case, and, looking through the letters, saw\nthat they were addressed to M. de Saint Pierre and were plainly of an\nintimate character. \"I found them on the floor near the stove in the\ndining-room,\" said the widow, \"and I kept them. I admit it was a wrong\nthing to do, but Georges will forgive me when he knows why I did it.\"\nFrom his better acquaintance with her character Mace surmised that\nan action admitted by the widow to be \"wrong\" was in all probability\nsomething worse. Without delay he took the prisoner back to his office,\nand himself left for Courbevoie, there to enlighten, if possible, her\nunhappy victim as to the real character of his enchantress.\n\nThe interview was a painful one. The lover refused to hear a word\nagainst his mistress. \"Jeanne is my Antigone,\" he said. \"She has\nlavished on me all her care, her tenderness, her love, and she believes\nin God.\" Mace told him of her past, of the revelations contained in the\nprie-Dieu of this true believer, but he could make no impression. \"I\nforgive her past, I accept her present, and please understand me, no one\nhas the power to separate me from her.\" It was only when Mace placed in\nhis hands the bundle of burnt letters, that he might feel what he could\nnot see, and read him some passages from them, that the unhappy man\nrealised the full extent of his mistress' treachery. Feeling himself\ndangerously ill, dying perhaps, M. de Saint Pierre had told the widow to\nbring from his rooms to the Rue de Boulogne the contents of his private\ndesk. It contained some letters compromising to a woman's honour. These\nhe was anxious to destroy before it was too late. As he went through the\npapers, his eyes bandaged, he gave them to the widow to throw into the\nstove. He could hear the fire burning and feel its warmth. He heard the\nwidow take up the tongs. He asked her why she did so. She answered that\nit was to keep the burning papers inside the stove. Now from Mace he\nlearnt the real truth. She had used the tongs to take out some of the\nletters half burnt, letters which in her possession might be one day\nuseful instruments for levying blackmail on her lover. \"To blind me,\"\nexclaimed M. de Saint Pierre, \"to torture me, and then profit by my\ncondition to lie to me, to betray me--it's infamous--infamous!\" His\ndream was shattered. Mace had succeeded in his task; the disenchantment\nof M. de Saint Pierre was complete. That night the fastidious widow\njoined the thieves and prostitutes in the St. Lazare Prison.\n\nIt was all very well to imprison the widow, but her participation in the\noutrage on M. de Saint Pierre was by no means established.\n\nThe reputed brother, who had been in the habit of attending on her at\nthe Rue de Boulogne, still eluded the searches of the police. In silence\nlay the widow's only hope of baffling her enemies. Unfortunately for the\nwidow, confinement told on her nerves. She became anxious, excited. Her\nvery ignorance of what was going on around her, her lover's silence\nmade her apprehensive; she began to fear the worst. At length--the widow\nalways had an itch for writing--she determined to communicate at all\ncosts with Gaudry and invoke his aid. She wrote appealing to him to\ncome forward and admit that he was the man the police were seeking, for\nsheltering whom she had been thrown into prison. She drew a harrowing\npicture of her sufferings in jail. She had refused food and been\nforcibly fed; she would like to dash her head against the walls. If any\nmisfortune overtake Gaudry, she promises to adopt his son and leave him\na third of her property. She persuaded a fellow-prisoner; an Italian\ndancer undergoing six months' imprisonment for theft, who was on the\npoint of being released, to take the letter and promise to deliver it to\nGaudry at Saint Denis. On her release the dancer told her lover of her\npromise. He refused to allow her to mix herself up in such a case, and\ndestroyed the letter. Then the dancer blabbed to others, until her story\nreached the ears of the police. Mace sent for her. At first she could\nremember only that the name Nathalis occurred in the letter, but after\nvisiting accidentally the Cathedral at Saint Denis, she recollected that\nthis Nathalis lived there, and worked in an oil factory. It was easy\nafter this for the police to trace Gaudry. He was arrested. At his\nhouse, letters from the widow were found, warning him not to come to her\napartment, and appointing to meet him in Charonne Cemetery. Gaudry made\na full confession. It was his passion for the widow, and a promise on\nher part to marry him, which, he said, had induced him to perpetrate so\nabominable a crime. He was sent to the Mazas Prison.\n\nIn the meantime the Widow Gras was getting more and more desperate.\nHer complete ignorance tormented her. At last she gave up all hope, and\ntwice attempted suicide with powdered glass and verdigris. On May 12 the\nexamining magistrate confronted her with Gaudry. The man told his story,\nthe widow feigned surprise that the \"friend of her childhood\" should\nmalign her so cruelly. But to her desperate appeals Gaudry would only\nreply, \"It is too late!\" They were sent for trial.\n\nThe trial of the widow and her accomplice opened before the Paris Assize\nCourt on July 23, 1877, and lasted three days. The widow was defended by\nLachaud, one of the greatest criminal advocates of France, the defender\nof Madame Lafarge, La Pommerais, Troppmann, and Marshal Bazaine. M.\nDemange (famous later for his defence of Dreyfus) appeared for Gaudry.\nThe case had aroused considerable interest. Among those present at the\ntrial were Halevy, the dramatist, and Mounet-Sully and Coquelin, from\nthe Comedie Francaise. Fernand Rodays thus described the widow in the\nFigaro: \"She looks more than her age, of moderate height, well made,\nneither blatant nor ill at ease, with nothing of the air of a woman of\nthe town. Her hands are small. Her bust is flat, and her back round, her\nhair quite white. Beneath her brows glitter two jet-black eyes--the eyes\nof a tigress, that seem to breathe hatred and revenge.\"\n\nGaudry was interrogated first. Asked by the President the motive of\nhis crime, he answered, \"I was mad for Madame Gras; I would have done\nanything she told me. I had known her as a child, I had been brought\nup with her. Then I saw her again. I loved her, I was mad for her, I\ncouldn't resist it. Her wish was law to me.\"\n\nAsked if Gaudry had spoken the truth, the widow said that he lied. The\nPresident asked what could be his motive for accusing her unjustly.\nThe widow was silent. Lachaud begged her to answer. \"I cannot,\" she\nfaltered. The President invited her to sit down. After a pause the widow\nseemed to recover her nerve.\n\nPresident: Was Gaudry at your house while you were at the ball?\n\nWidow: No, no! He daren't look me in the face and say so.\n\nPresident: But he is looking at you now.\n\nWidow: No, he daren't! (She fixes her eyes on Gaudry, who lowers his\nhead.)\n\nPresident: I, whose duty it is to interrogate you, look you in the face\nand repeat my question: Was Gaudry at your house at half-past ten that\nnight?\n\nWidow: No.\n\nPresident: You hear her, Gaudry?\n\nGaudry: Yes, Monsieur, but I was there.\n\nWidow: It is absolutely impossible! Can anyone believe me guilty of such\na thing.\n\nPresident: Woman Gras, you prefer to feign indignation and deny\neverything. You have the right. I will read your examination before the\nexamining magistrate. I see M. Lachaud makes a gesture, but I must beg\nthe counsel for the defence not to impart unnecessary passion into these\nproceedings.\n\nLachaud: My gesture was merely meant to express that the woman Gras\nis on her trial, and that under the circumstances her indignation is\nnatural.\n\nPresident: Very good.\n\nThe appearance in the witness box of the widow's unhappy victim\nevoked sympathy. He gave his evidence quietly, without resentment or\nindignation. As he told his story the widow, whose eyes were fixed on\nhim all the time, murmured: \"Georges! Georges! Defend me! Defend me!\" \"I\nstate the facts,\" he replied.\n\nThe prisoners could only defend themselves by trying to throw on each\nother the guilt of the crime. M. Demange represented Gaudry as acting\nunder the influence of his passion for the Widow Gras. Lachaud, on the\nother hand, attributed the crime solely to Gaudry's jealousy of the\nwidow's lover, and contended that he was the sole author of the outrage.\n\nThe jury by their verdict assigned to the widow the greater share of\nresponsibility. She was found guilty in the full degree, but to Gaudry\nwere accorded extenuating circumstances. The widow was condemned\nto fifteen years' penal servitude, her accomplice to five years'\nimprisonment.\n\nIt is dreadful to think how very near the Widow Gras came to\naccomplishing successfully her diabolical crime. A little less\npercipitancy on her part, and she might have secured the fruits of\nher cruelty. Her undoubted powers of fascination, in spite of the\nfiendishness of her real character, are doubly proved by the devotion of\nher lover and the guilt of her accomplice. At the same time, with that\nstrange contradiction inherent in human nature, the Jekyll and Hyde\nelements which, in varying degree, are present in all men and women, the\nWidow Gras had a genuine love for her young sister. Her hatred of men\nwas reasoned, deliberate, merciless and implacable. There is something\nalmost sadistic in the combination in her character of erotic sensibility\nwith extreme cruelty.\n\n\n\n\nVitalis and Marie Boyer\n\n\nI found the story of this case in a brochure published in Paris as\none of a series of modern causes celebres. I have compared it with the\nreports of the trial in the Gazette des Tribunaux.\n\nI In the May of 1874, in the town of Montpellier, M. Boyer, a retired\nmerchant, some forty-six years of age, lay dying. For some months\nprevious to his death he had been confined to his bed, crippled by\nrheumatic gout. As the hour of his death drew near, M. Boyer was filled\nwith a great longing to see his daughter, Marie, a girl of fifteen, and\nembrace her for the last time. The girl was being educated in a convent\nat Marseilles. One of M. Boyer's friends offered to go there to fetch\nher. On arriving at the convent, he was told that Marie had become\ngreatly attracted by the prospect of a religious life. \"You are happy,\"\nthe Mother Superior had written to her mother, \"very happy never to\nhave allowed the impure breath of the world to have soiled this little\nflower. She loves you and her father more than one can say.\" Her\nfather's friend found the girl dressed in the costume of a novice, and\nwas told that she had expressed her desire to take, one day, her final\nvows. He informed Marie of her father's dying state, of his earnest wish\nto see her for the last time, and told her that he had come to take\nher to his bedside. \"Take me away from here?\" she exclaimed. The Mother\nSuperior, surprised at her apparent reluctance to go, impressed on her\nthe duty of acceding to her father's wish. To the astonishment of both,\nMarie refused to leave the convent. If she could save her father's life,\nshe said, she would go, but, as that was impossible and she dreaded\ngoing out into the world again, she would stay and pray for her father\nin the chapel of the convent, where her prayers would be quite as\neffective as by his bedside. In vain the friend and the Mother Superior\ntried to bend her resolution.\n\nHappily M. Boyer died before he could learn of his daughter's singular\nrefusal. But it had made an unfavourable impression on the friend's\nmind. He looked on Marie as a girl without real feeling, an egoist, her\nreligion purely superficial, hiding a cold and selfish disposition; he\nfelt some doubt as to the future development of her character.\n\nM. Boyer left a widow, a dark handsome woman, forty years of age.\n\nSome twenty years before his death, Marie Salat had come to live with\nM. Boyer as a domestic servant. He fell in love with her, she became his\nmistress, and a few months before the birth of Marie, M. Boyer made her\nhis wife. Madame Boyer was at heart a woman of ardent and voluptuous\npassions that only wanted opportunity to become careless in their\ngratification. Her husband's long illness gave her such an opportunity.\nAt the time of his death she was carrying on an intrigue with a\nbookseller's assistant, Leon Vitalis, a young man of twenty-one. Her\nbed-ridden husband, ignorant of her infidelity, accepted gratefully\nthe help of Vitalis, whom his wife described as a relative, in the\nregulation of his affairs. At length the unsuspecting Boyer died. The\nnight of his death Madame Boyer spent with her lover.\n\nThe mother had never felt any great affection for her only child.\n\nDuring her husband's lifetime she was glad to have Marie out of the way\nat the convent. But the death of M. Boyer changed the situation. He\nhad left almost the whole of his fortune, about 100,000 francs, to his\ndaughter, appointing her mother her legal guardian with a right to the\nenjoyment of the income on the capital until Marie should come of age.\nMadame Boyer had not hitherto taken her daughter's religious devotion\nvery seriously. But now that the greater part of her husband's fortune\nwas left to Marie, she realised that, should her daughter persist in\nher intention of taking the veil, that fortune would in a very few\nyears pass into the hands of the sisterhood. Without delay Madame Boyer\nexercised her authority, and withdrew Marie from the convent. The girl\nquitted it with every demonstration of genuine regret.\n\nMarie Boyer when she left the convent was growing into a tall and\nattractive woman, her figure slight and elegant, her hair and eyes\ndark, dainty and charming in her manner. Removed from the influences of\nconvent life, her religious devotion became a thing of the past. In her\nnew surroundings she gave herself up to the enjoyments of music and\nthe theatre. She realised that she was a pretty girl, whose beauty\nwell repaid the hours she now spent in the adornment of her person. The\ncharms of Marie were not lost on Leon Vitalis. Mean and significant\nin appearance, Vitalis would seem to have been one of those men who,\nwithout any great physical recommendation, have the knack of making\nthemselves attractive to women. After her husband's death Madame Boyer\nhad yielded herself completely to his influence and her own undoubted\npassion for him. She had given him the money with which to purchase\na business of his own as a second-hand bookseller. This trade the\nenterprising and greedy young man combined with money-lending and he\nclandestine sale of improper books and photographs. To such a man the\ncoming of Marie Boyer was a significant event. She was younger, more\nattractive than her mother; in a very few years the whole of her\nfather's fortune would be hers. Slowly Vitalis set himself to win the\ngirl's affections. The mother's suspicions were aroused; her jealousy\nwas excited. She sent Marie to complete her education at a convent\nschool in Lyons. This was in the April of 1875. By this time Marie\nand Vitalis had become friendly enough to arrange to correspond\nclandestinely during the girl's absence from home. Marie was so far\nignorant of the relations of Vitalis with her mother.\n\nHer daughter sent away, Madame Boyer surrendered herself with complete\nabandonment to her passion for her lover. At Castelnau, close to\nMontpellier, she bought a small country house. There she could give full\nrein to her desire. To the scandal of the occasional passerby she and\nher lover would bathe in a stream that passed through the property,\nand sport together on the grass. Indoors there were always books from\nVitalis' collection to stimulate their lascivious appetites. This life\nof pastoral impropriety lasted until the middle of August, when Marie\nBoyer came home from Lyons.\n\nVitalis would have concealed from the young girl as long as he could the\nnature of his relations with Madame Boyer, but his mistress by her own\ndeliberate conduct made all concealment impossible. Whether from the\nutter recklessness of her passion for Vitalis, or a desire to kill in\nher daughter's heart any attachment which she may have felt towards her\nlover, the mother paraded openly before her daughter the intimacy of her\nrelations with Vitalis, and with the help of the literature with which\nthe young bookseller supplied her, set about corrupting her child's mind\nto her own depraved level. The effect of her extraordinary conduct was,\nhowever, the opposite to what she had intended. The mind of the young\ngirl was corrupted; she was familiarised with vice. But in her heart\nshe did not blame Vitalis for what she saw and suffered; she pitied, she\nexcused him. It was her mother whom she grew to hate, with a hate all\nthe more determined for the cold passionless exterior beneath which it\nwas concealed.\n\nMadame Boyer's deliberate display of her passion for Vitalis served only\nto aggravate and intensify in Marie Boyer an unnatural jealousy that was\nfast growing up between mother and daughter.\n\nMarie did not return to the school at Lyons. In the winter of 1875,\nMadame Boyer gave up the country house and, with her daughter, settled\nin one of the suburbs of Montpellier. In the January of 1876 a theft\noccurred in her household which obliged Madame Boyer to communicate\nwith the police. Spendthrift and incompetent in the management of her\naffairs, she was hoarding and suspicious about money itself. Cash and\nbonds she would hide away in unexpected places, such as books, dresses,\neven a soup tureen. One of her most ingenious hiding places was a\nportrait of her late husband, behind which she concealed some bearer\nbonds in landed security, amounting to about 11,000 francs. One day in\nJanuary these bonds disappeared. She suspected a theft, and informed\nthe police. Three days later she withdrew her complaint, and no more\nwas heard of the matter. As Marie and Vitalis were the only persons who\ncould have known her secret, the inference is obvious. When, later in\nthe year, Vitalis announced his intention of going to Paris on business,\nhis mistress expressed to him the hope that he would \"have a good time\"\nwith her bonds. Vitalis left for Paris. But there was now a distinct\nunderstanding between Marie and himself. Vitalis had declared himself\nher lover and asked her to marry him. The following letter, written to\nhim by Marie Boyer in the October of 1876, shows her attitude toward his\nproposal:\n\n\n\"I thank you very sincerely for your letter, which has given me very\ngreat pleasure, because it tells me that you are well. It sets my mind\nat rest, for my feelings towards you are the same as ever. I don't say\nthey are those of love, for I don't know myself; I don't know what such\nfeelings are. But I feel a real affection for you which may well turn to\nlove. How should I not hold in affectionate remembrance one who has done\neverything for me? But love does not come to order. So I can't and don't\nwish to give any positive answer about our marriage--all depends on\ncircumstances. I don't want any promise from you, I want you to be as\nfree as I am. I am not fickle, you know me well enough for that. So\ndon't ask me to give you any promise. You may find my letter a little\ncold. But I know too much of life to pledge myself lightly. I assure\nyou I think on it often. Sometimes I blush when I think what marriage\nmeans.\"\n\n\nMadame Boyer, displeased at the theft, had let her lover go without any\ngreat reluctance. No sooner had he gone than she began to miss him. Life\nseemed dull without him. Mother and daughter were united at least in\ntheir common regret at the absence of the young bookseller. To vary the\nmonotony of existence, to find if possible a husband for her daughter,\nMadame Boyer decided to leave Montpellier for Marseilles, and there\nstart some kind of business. The daughter, who foresaw greater amusement\nand pleasure in the life of a large city, assented willingly. On October\n6, 1876, they arrived at Marseilles, and soon after Madame bought at\na price considerably higher than their value, two shops adjoining one\nanother in the Rue de la Republique. One was a cheese shop, the other a\nmilliner's.\n\nThe mother arranged that she should look after the cheese shop, while\nher daughter presided over the milliner's. The two shops were next door\nto one another. Behind the milliner's was a drawing-room, behind the\ncheese shop a kitchen; these two rooms communicated with each other by\na large dark room at the back of the building. In the kitchen was a\ntrap-door leading to a cellar. The two women shared a bedroom in an\nadjoining house.\n\nVitalis had opposed the scheme of his mistress to start shop-keeping in\nMarseilles. He knew how unfitted she was to undertake a business of\nany kind. But neither mother nor daughter would relinquish the plan. It\nremained therefore to make the best of it. Vitalis saw that he must get\nthe business into his own hands; and to do that, to obtain full control\nof Madame Boyer's affairs, he must continue to play the lover to her. To\nthe satisfaction of the two women, he announced his intention of coming\nto Marseilles in the New Year of 1877. It was arranged that he should\npass as a nephew of Madame Boyer, the cousin of Marie. He arrived at\nMarseilles on January 1, and received a cordial welcome. Of the domestic\narrangements that ensued, it is sufficient to say that they were\ncalculated to whet the jealousy and inflame the hatred that Marie felt\ntowards her mother, who now persisted as before in parading before her\ndaughter the intimacy of her relations with Vitalis.\n\nIn these circumstances Vitalis succeeded in extracting from his mistress\na power of attorney, giving him authority to deal with her affairs and\nsell the two businesses, which were turning out unprofitable. This done,\nhe told Marie, whose growing attachment to him, strange as it may seem,\nhad turned to love, that now at last they could be free. He would sell\nthe two shops, and with the money released by the sale they could go\naway to-gether. Suddenly Madame Boyer fell ill, and was confined to her\nbed. Left to themselves, the growing passion of Marie Boyer for Vitalis\nculminated in her surrender. But for the sick mother the happiness of\nthe lovers was complete. If only her illness were more serious, more\nlikely to be fatal in its result! \"If only God would take her!\" said\nVitalis. \"Yes,\" replied her daughter, \"she has caused us so much\nsuffering!\"\n\nTo Madame Boyer her illness had brought hours of torment, and at last\nremorse. She realised the duplicity of her lover, she knew that he meant\nto desert her for her daughter, she saw what wrong she had done that\ndaughter, she suspected even that Marie and Vitalis were poisoning her.\nIrreligious till now, her thoughts turned to religion. As soon as she\ncould leave her bed she would go to Mass and make atonement for her sin;\nshe would recover her power of attorney, get rid of Vitalis for good\nand all, and send her daughter back to a convent. But it was too late.\nNemesis was swift to overtake the hapless woman. Try as he might,\nVitalis had found it impossible to sell the shops at anything but a\nworthless figure. He had no money of his own, with which to take Marie\naway. He knew that her mother had resolved on his instant dismissal.\n\nAs soon as Madame Boyer was recovered sufficiently to leave her bed,\nshe turned on her former lover, denounced his treachery, accused him\nof robbing and swindling her, and bade him go without delay. To Vitalis\ndismissal meant ruin, to Marie it meant the loss of her lover. During\nher illness the two young people had wished Madame Boyer dead, but she\nhad recovered. Providence or Nature having refused to assist Vitalis,\nhe resolved to fall back on art. He gave up a whole night's rest to\nthe consideration of the question. As a result of his deliberations he\nsuggested to the girl of seventeen the murder of her mother. \"This must\nend,\" said Vitalis. \"Yes, it must,\" replied Marie. Vitalis asked her if\nshe had any objection to such a crime. Marie hesitated, the victim was\nher mother. Vitalis reminded her what sort of a mother she had been to\nher. The girl said that she was terrified at the sight of blood; Vitalis\npromised that her mother should be strangled. At length Marie consented.\nThat night on some slight pretext Madame Boyer broke out into violent\nreproaches against her daughter. She little knew that every reproach\nshe uttered served only to harden in her daughter's heart her unnatural\nresolve.\n\nOn the morning of March 19 Madame Boyer rose early to go to Mass.\n\nBefore she went out, she reminded Vitalis that this was his last day in\nher service, that when she returned she would expect to find him gone.\nIt was after seven when she left the house. The lovers had no time to\nlose; the deed must be done immediately on the mother's return. They\narranged that Vitalis should get rid of the shop-boy, and that, as soon\nas he had gone, Marie should shut and lock the front doors of the\ntwo shops. At one o'clock Madame Boyer came back. She expressed her\nastonishment and disgust that Vitalis still lingered, and threatened to\nsend for the police to turn him out. Vitalis told the shop-boy that he\ncould go away for a few hours; they had some family affairs to settle.\nThe boy departed. Madame Boyer, tired after her long morning in the\ntown, was resting on a sofa in the sitting-room, at the back of the\nmilliner's shop. Vitalis entered the room, and after a few heated words,\nstruck her a violent blow in the chest. She fell back on the sofa,\ncalling to her daughter to come to her assistance. The daughter sought\nto drown her mother's cries by banging the doors, and opening and\nshutting drawers. Vitalis, who was now trying to throttle his victim,\ncalled to Marie to shut the front doors of the two shops.\n\nTo do so Marie had to pass through the sitting-room, and was a witness\nto the unsuccessful efforts of Vitalis to strangle her mother. Having\nclosed the doors, she retired into the milliner's shop to await the\nissue. After a few moments her lover called to her for the large cheese\nknife; he had caught up a kitchen knife, but in his struggles it had\nslipped from his grasp. Quickly Marie fetched the knife and returned to\nthe sitting-room. There a desperate struggle was taking place between\nthe man and woman. At one moment it seemed as if Madame Boyer would get\nthe better of Vitalis, whom nature had not endowed greatly for work of\nthis kind. Marie came to his aid. She kicked and beat her mother, until\nat last the wretched creature released her hold and sank back exhausted.\nWith the cheese knife, which her daughter had fetched, Vitalis killed\nMadame Boyer.\n\nThey were murderers now, the young lovers. What to do with the body? The\nboy would be coming back soon. The cellar under the kitchen seemed\nthe obvious place of concealment. With the help of a cord the body was\nlowered into the cellar, and Marie washed the floor of the sitting-room.\nThe boy came back. He asked where Madame Boyer was. Vitalis told him\nthat she was getting ready to return to Montpellier the same evening,\nand that he had arranged to go with her, but that he had no intention\nof doing so; he would accompany her to the station, he said, and then at\nthe last moment, just as the train was starting, slip away and let\nher go on her journey alone. To the boy, who knew enough of the inner\nhistory of the household to enjoy the piquancy of the situation, such a\ntrick seemed quite amusing. He went away picturing in his mind the scene\nat the railway station and its humorous possibilities.\n\nAt seven o'clock Vitalis and Marie Boyer were alone once more with\nthe murdered woman. They had the whole night before them. Vitalis had\nalready considered the matter of the disposal of the body. He had bought\na pick and spade. He intended to bury his former mistress in the soil\nunder the cellar. After that had been done, he and Marie would sell the\nbusiness for what it would fetch, and go to Brussels--an admirable plan,\nwhich two unforeseen circumstances defeated. The Rue de la Republique\nwas built on a rock, blasted out for the purpose. The shop-boy had gone\nto the station that evening to enjoy the joke which, he believed, was to\nbe played on his mistress.\n\nWhen Vitalis tried to dig a grave into the ground beneath the cellar\nhe realised the full horror of the disappointment. What was to be done?\nThey must throw the body into the sea. But how to get it there? The\ncrime of Billoir, an old soldier, who the year before in Paris had\nkilled his mistress in a fit of anger and cut up her body, was fresh in\nthe recollection of Vitalis. The guilty couple decided to dismember\nthe body of Madame Boyer and so disfigure her face as to render it\nunrecognisable. In the presence of Marie, Vitalis did this, and the two\nlovers set out at midnight to discover some place convenient for the\nreception of the remains. They found the harbour too busy for their\npurpose, and decided to wait until the morrow, when they would go\nfarther afield. They returned home and retired for the night, occupying\nthe bed in which Madame Boyer had slept the night before.\n\nOn the morning of the 20th the lovers rose early, and a curious\nneighbour, looking through the keyhole, saw them counting joyously money\nand valuables, as they took them from Madame Boyer's cashbox. When the\nshop-boy arrived, he asked Vitalis for news of Madame Boyer. Vitalis\ntold him that he had gone with her to the station, that she had taken\nthe train to Montpellier, and that, in accordance with his plan, he had\ngiven her the slip just as the train was starting. This the boy knew to\nbe false: he had been to the station himself to enjoy the fun, and had\nseen neither Vitalis nor Madame Boyer. He began to suspect some mystery.\nIn the evening, when the shops had been closed, and he had been sent\nabout his business, he waited and watched. In a short time he saw\nVitalis and Marie Boyer leave the house, the former dragging a hand-cart\ncontaining two large parcels, while Marie walked by his side. They\ntravelled some distance with their burden, leaving the city behind\nthem, hoping to find some deserted spot along the coast where they could\nconceal the evidence of their crime. Their nerves were shaken by meeting\nwith a custom-house officer, who asked them what it was they had in\nthe cart. Vitalis answered that it was a traveller's luggage, and the\nofficer let them pass on. But soon after, afraid to risk another such\nexperience, the guilty couple turned out the parcels into a ditch,\ncovered them with stones and sand, and hurried home.\n\nThe next day, the shop-boy and the inquisitive neighbour having\nconsulted together, went to the Commissary of Police and told him of\nthe mysterious disappearance of Madame Boyer. The Commissary promised to\ninvestigate the matter, and had just dismissed his informants when word\nwas brought to him of the discovery, in a ditch outside Marseilles, of\ntwo parcels containing human remains. He called back the boy and took\nhim to view the body at the Morgue. The boy was able, by the clothes,\nto identify the body as that of his late mistress. The Commissary went\nstraight to the shops in the Rue de la Republique, where he found the\nyoung lovers preparing for flight. At first they denied all knowledge of\nthe crime, and said that Madame Boyer had gone to Montpellier. They were\narrested, and it was not long before they both confessed their guilt to\nthe examining magistrate.\n\nVitalis and Marie Boyer were tried before the Assize Court at Aix\non July 2, 1877. Vitalis is described as mean and insignificant in\nappearance, thin, round-backed, of a bilious complexion; Marie Boyer\nas a pretty, dark girl, her features cold in expression, dainty and\nelegant. At her trial she seemed to be still so greatly under the\ninfluence of Vitalis that during her interrogatory the President sent\nhim out of court. To the examining magistrate Marie Boyer, in describing\nher mother's murder, had written, \"I cannot think how I came to take\npart in it. I, who wouldn't have stayed in the presence of a corpse for\nall the money in the world.\" Vitalis was condemned to death, and was\nexecuted on August 17. He died fearful and penitent, acknowledging\nhis miserable career to be a warning to misguided youth. Extenuating\ncircumstances were accorded to Marie Boyer, and she was sentenced to\npenal servitude for life. Her conduct in prison was so repentant and\nexemplary that she was released in 1892.\n\nM. Proal, a distinguished French judge, and the author of some important\nworks on crime, acted as the examining magistrate in the case of Vitalis\nand Marie Boyer. He thus sums up his impression of the two criminals:\n\"Here is an instance of how greed and baseness on the one side, lust and\njealousy on the other, bring about by degrees a change in the\ncharacters of criminals, and, after some hesitation, the suggestion and\naccomplishment of parricide, Is it necessary to seek an explanation\nof the crime in any psychic abnormality which is negatived to all\nappearances by the antecedents of the guilty pair? Is it necessary to\nask it of anatomy or physiology? Is not the crime the result of moral\ndegradation gradually asserting itself in two individuals, whose moral\nand intellectual faculties are the same as those of other men, but\nwho fall, step by step, into vice and crime? It is by a succession of\nwrongful acts that a man first reaches the frontier of crime and then at\nlength crosses it.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Fenayrou Case\n\n\nThere is an account of this case in Bataille \"Causes Criminelles et\nMondaines\" (1882), and in Mace's book, \"Femmes Criminelles.\" It is\nalluded to in \"Souvenirs d'un President d'Assises,\" by Berard des\nGlajeux. The murder of the chemist Aubert by Marin Fenayrou and his wife\nGabrielle was perpetrated near Paris in the year 1882. In its beginning\nthe story is commonplace enough. Fenayrou was the son of a small\nchemist in the South of France, and had come to Paris from the Aveyron\nDepartment to follow his father's vocation. He obtained a situation\nas apprentice in the Rue de la Ferme des Mathurins in the shop of a M.\nGibon. On the death of M. Gibon his widow thought she saw in Fenayrou\na man capable of carrying on her late husband's business. She gave her\ndaughter in marriage to her apprentice, and installed him in the\nshop. The ungrateful son-in-law, sure of his wife and his business and\ncontrary to his express promise, turned the old lady out of the house.\nThis occurred in the year 1870, Fenayrou being then thirty years of age,\nhis wife, Gabrielle, seventeen.\n\nThey were an ill-assorted and unattractive couple. The man, a compound\nof coarse brutality and shrewd cunning, was at heart lazy and selfish,\nthe woman a spoilt child, in whom a real want of feeling was supplied by\na shallow sentimentalism. Vain of the superior refinement conferred\non her by a good middle-class education, she despised and soon came to\nloathe her coarse husband, and lapsed into a condition of disappointment\nand discontent that was only relieved superficially by an extravagant\ndevotion to religious exercises.\n\nIt was in 1875, when the disillusionment of Mme. Fenayrou was complete,\nthat her husband received into his shop a pupil, a youth of twenty-one,\nLouis Aubert. He was the son of a Norman tradesman. The ambitious father\nhad wished his son to enter the church, but the son preferred to be a\nchemist. He was a shrewd, hard-working fellow, with an eye to the main\nchance and a taste for pleasures that cost him nothing, jovial, but\nvulgar and self-satisfied, the kind of man who, having enjoyed the\nfavours of woman, treats her with arrogance and contempt, till from\nloving she comes to loathe him--a characteristic example, according\nto M. Bourget, of le faux homme a femmes. Such was Aubert, Fenayrou's\npupil. He was soon to become something more than pupil.\n\nFenayrou as chemist had not answered to the expectations of his\nmother-in-law. His innate laziness and love of coarse pleasures had\nasserted themselves. At first his wife had shared in the enjoyments, but\nas time went on and after the birth of their two children, things became\nless prosperous. She was left at home while Fenayrou spent his time\nin drinking bocks of beer, betting and attending race-meetings. It was\nnecessary, under these circumstances, that someone should attend to\nthe business of the shop. In Aubert Fenayrou found a ready and willing\nassistant.\n\nFrom 1876 to 1880, save for an occasional absence for military service,\nAubert lived with the Fenayrous, managing the business and making love\nto the bored and neglected wife, who after a few months became his\nmistress. Did Fenayrou know of this intrigue or not? That is a crucial\nquestion in the case. If he did not, it was not for want of warning from\ncertain of his friends and neighbours, to whom the intrigue was a matter\nof common knowledge. Did he refuse to believe in his wife's guilt? or,\ndependent as he was for his living on the exertions of his assistant,\ndid he deliberately ignore it, relying on his wife's attractions to\nkeep the assiduous Aubert at work in the shop? In any case Aubert's\narrogance, which had increased with the consciousness of his importance\nto the husband and his conquest of the wife, led in August of 1880, to\na rupture. Aubert left the Fenayrous and bought a business of his own on\nthe Boulevard Malesherbes.\n\nBefore his departure Aubert had tried to persuade Mme. Gibon to sell up\nher son-in-law by claiming from him the unpaid purchase-money for her\nhusband's shop. He represented Fenayrou as an idle gambler, and hinted\nthat he would find her a new purchaser. Such an underhand proceeding was\nlikely to provoke resentment if it should come to the ears of Fenayrou.\nDuring the two years that elapsed between his departure from Fenayrou's\nhouse and his murder, Aubert had prospered in his shop on the Boulevard\nMalesherbes, whilst the fortunes of the Fenayrous had steadily\ndeteriorated.\n\nAt the end of the year 1881 Fenayrou sold his shop and went with\nhis family to live on one of the outer boulevards, that of\nGouvion-Saint-Cyr. He had obtained a post in a shady mining company, in\nwhich he had persuaded his mother-in-law to invest 20,000 francs. He had\nattempted also to make money by selling fradulent imitations of a\nfamous table-water. For this offence, at the beginning of 1882, he\nwas condemned by the Correctional Tribunal of Paris to three months'\nimprisonment and 1,000 francs costs.\n\nIn March of 1882 the situation of the Fenayrous was parlous, that of\nAubert still prosperous.\n\nSince Aubert's departure Mme. Fenayrou had entertained another lover, a\ngentleman on the staff of a sporting newspaper, one of Fenayrou's turf\nacquaintances. This gentleman had found her a cold mistress, preferring\nthe ideal to the real. As a murderess Madame Fenayrou overcame this\nweakness.\n\nIf we are to believe Fenayrou's story, the most critical day in his life\nwas March 22, 1882, for it was on that day, according to his account,\nthat he learnt for the first time of his wife's intrigue with Aubert.\nHorrified and enraged at the discovery, he took from her her nuptial\nwreath, her wedding-ring, her jewellery, removed from its frame her\npicture in charcoal which hung in the drawing-room, and told her,\nparalysed with terror, that the only means of saving her life was to\nhelp him to murder her lover.\n\nTwo months later, with her assistance, this outraged husband\naccomplished his purpose with diabolical deliberation. He must have been\nwell aware that, had he acted on the natural impulse of the moment and\nrevenged himself then and there on Aubert, he would have committed what\nis regarded by a French jury as the most venial of crimes, and would\nhave escaped with little or no punishment. He preferred, for reasons of\nhis own, to set about the commission of a deliberate and cold-blooded\nmurder that bears the stamp of a more sinister motive than the vengeance\nof a wronged husband.\n\nThe only step he took after the alleged confession of his wife on March\n22 was to go to a commissary of police and ask him to recover from\nAubert certain letters of his wife's that were in his possession. This\nthe commissary refused to do. Mme. Gibon, the mother-in-law, was sent to\nAubert to try to recover the letters, but Aubert declined to give them\nup, and wrote to Mme. Fenayrou:\n\n\n\"Madame, to my displeasure I have had a visit this morning from your\nmother, who has come to my home and made a most unnecessary scene\nand reproached me with facts so serious that I must beg you to see me\nwithout delay. It concerns your honour and mine.... I have no fear of\nbeing confronted with your husband and yourself. I am ready, when\nyou wish, to justify myself.... Please do all you can to prevent\na repetition of your mother's visit or I shall have to call in the\npolice.\"\n\n\nIt is clear that the Fenayrous attached the utmost importance to the\nrecovery of this correspondence, which disappeared with Aubert's death.\nWas the prime motive of the murder the recovery and destruction of these\nletters? Was Aubert possessed of some knowledge concerning the Fenayrous\nthat placed them at his mercy?\n\nIt would seem so. To a friend who had warned him of the danger to which\nhis intimacy with Gabrielle Fenayrou exposed him, Aubert had replied,\n\"Bah! I've nothing to fear. I hold them in my power.\" The nature of\nthe hold which Aubert boasted that he possessed over these two persons\nremains the unsolved mystery of the case, \"that limit of investigation,\"\nin the words of a French judge, \"one finds in most great cases, beyond\nwhich justice strays into the unknown.\"\n\nThat such a hold existed, Aubert's own statement and the desperate\nattempts made by the Fenayrous to get back these letters, would seem\nto prove beyond question. Had Aubert consented to return them, would\nhe have saved his life? It seems probable. As it was, he was doomed.\nFenayrou hated him. They had had a row on a race-course, in the course\nof which Aubert had humiliated his former master. More than this, Aubert\nhad boasted openly of his relations with Mme. Fenayrou, and the fact\nhad reached the ears of the husband. Fenayrou believed also, though\nerroneously, that Aubert had informed against him in the matter of the\ntable-water fraud. Whether his knowledge of Aubert's relations with\nhis wife was recent or of long standing, he had other grounds of hate\nagainst his former pupil. He himself had failed in life, but he saw his\nrival prosperous, arrogant in his prosperity, threatening, dangerous\nto his peace of mind; he envied and feared as well as hated him.\nCruel, cunning and sinister, Fenayrou spent the next two months in the\nmeditation of a revenge that was not only to remove the man he feared,\nbut was to give him a truly fiendish opportunity of satisfying his\nferocious hatred.\n\nAnd the wife what of her share in the business? Had she also come to\nhate Aubert? Or did she seek to expiate her guilt by assisting her\nhusband in the punishment of her seducer? A witness at the trial\ndescribed Mme. Fenayrou as \"a soft paste\" that could be moulded equally\nwell to vice or virtue, a woman destitute of real feeling or strength of\nwill, who, under the direction of her husband, carried out implicitly,\nprecisely and carefully her part in an atrocious murder, whose only\neffort to prevent the commission of such a deed was to slip away into a\nchurch a few minutes before she was to meet the man she was decoying to\nhis death, and pray that his murder might be averted.\n\nHer religious sense, like the images in the hat of Louis XI., was a\nsource of comfort and consolation in the doing of evil, but powerless\nto restrain her from the act itself, in the presence of a will stronger\nthan her own. At the time of his death Aubert contemplated marriage, and\nhad advertised for a wife. If Mme. Fenayrou was aware of this, it may\nhave served to stimulate her resentment against her lover, but there\nseems little reason to doubt that, left to herself, she would never have\nhad the will or the energy to give that resentment practical expression.\nIt required the dictation of the vindictive and malevolent Fenayrou to\ncrystallise her hatred of Aubert into a deliberate participation in his\nmurder.\n\nEight or nine miles north-west of Paris lies the small town of Chatou, a\npleasant country resort for tired Parisians. Here Madeleine Brohan, the\nfamous actress, had inhabited a small villa, a two-storied building. At\nthe beginning of 1882 it was to let. In the April of that year a person\nof the name of \"Hess\" agreed to take it at a quarterly rent of 1,200\nfrancs, and paid 300 in advance. \"Hess\" was no other than Fenayrou--the\nvilla that had belonged to Madeleine Brohan the scene chosen for\nAubert's murder. Fenayrou was determined to spare no expense in the\nexecution of his design: it was to cost him some 3,000 francs before he\nhad finished with it.\n\nAs to the actual manner of his betrayer's death, the outraged husband\nfound it difficult to make up his mind. It was not to be prompt, nor\nwas unnecessary suffering to be avoided. At first he favoured a pair of\n\"infernal\" opera-glasses that concealed a couple of steel points which,\nby means of a spring, would dart out into the eyes of anyone using them\nand destroy their sight. This rather elaborate and uncertain machine was\nabandoned later in favour of a trap for catching wolves. This was to be\nplaced under the table, and seize in its huge iron teeth the legs of the\nvictim. In the end simplicity, in the shape of a hammer and sword-stick,\nwon the day. An assistant was taken in the person of Lucien Fenayrou, a\nbrother of Marin.\n\nThis humble and obliging individual, a maker of children's toys,\nregarded his brother the chemist with something like veneration as the\ngentleman and man of education of the family. Fifty francs must\nhave seemed to him an almost superfluous inducement to assist in the\nexecution of what appeared to be an act of legitimate vengeance, an\naffair of family honour in which the wife and brother of the injured\nhusband were in duty bound to participate. Mme. Fenayrou, with\ncharacteristic superstition, chose the day of her boy's first communion\nto broach the subject of the murder to Lucien. By what was perhaps more\nthan coincidence, Ascension Day, May 18, was selected as the day for the\ncrime itself. There were practical reasons also. It was a Thursday and\na public holiday. On Thursdays the Fenayrou children spent the day with\ntheir grandmother, and at holiday time there was a special midnight\ntrain from Chatou to Paris that would enable the murderers to return to\ntown after the commission of their crime. A goat chaise and twenty-six\nfeet of gas piping had been purchased by Fenayrou and taken down to the\nvilla.\n\nNothing remained but to secure the presence of the victim. At the\ndirection of her husband Mme. Fenayrou wrote to Aubert on May 14, a\nletter in which she protested her undying love for him, and expressed\na desire to resume their previous relations. Aubert demurred at first,\nbut, as she became more pressing, yielded at length to her suggestion.\nIf it cost him nothing, Aubert was the last man to decline an invitation\nof the kind. A trip to Chatou was arranged for Ascension Day, May 18, by\nthe train leaving Paris from the St. Lazare Station, at half-past eight\nin the evening.\n\nOn the afternoon of that day Fenayrou, his wife and his brother sent\nthe children to their grandmother and left Paris for Chatou at three\no'clock. Arrived there, they went to the villa, Fenayrou carrying\nthe twenty-six feet of gas-piping wound round him like some huge\nhunting-horn. He spent the afternoon in beating out the piping till it\nwas flat, and in making a gag. He tried to take up the flooring in the\nkitchen, but this plan for the concealment of the body was abandoned\nin favour of the river. As soon as these preparations, in which he was\nassisted by his two relatives, had been completed, Fenayrou placed a\ncandle, some matches and the sword-stick on the drawing-room table and\nreturned to Paris.\n\nThe three conspirators dined together heartily in the Avenue de\nClichy--soup, fish, entree, sweet and cheese, washed down by a bottle\nof claret and a pint of burgundy, coffee to follow, with a glass of\nchartreuse for Madame. To the waiter the party seemed in the best of\nspirits. Dinner ended, the two men returned to Chatou by the 7.35 train,\nleaving Gabrielle to follow an hour later with Aubert. Fenayrou had\ntaken three second-class return tickets for his wife, his brother and\nhimself, and a single for their visitor. It was during the interval\nbetween the departure of her husband and her meeting with Aubert that\nMme. Fenayrou went into the church of St. Louis d'Antin and prayed.\n\nAt half-past eight she met Aubert at the St. Lazare Station, gave\nhim his ticket and the two set out for Chatou--a strange journey Mme.\nFenayrou was asked what they talked about in the railway carriage. \"Mere\nnothings,\" she replied. Aubert abused her mother; for her own part, she\nwas very agitated--tres emotionnee. It was about half-past nine when\nthey reached their destination. The sight of the little villa pleased\nAubert.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, \"this is good. I should like a house like this and\ntwenty thousand francs a year!\" As he entered the hall, surprised at\nthe darkness, he exclaimed: \"The devil! it's precious dark! 'tu sais,\nGabrielle, que je ne suis pas un heros d'aventure.'\" The woman pushed\nhim into the drawing-room. He struck a match on his trousers. Fenayrou,\nwho had been lurking in the darkness in his shirt sleeves, made a blow\nat him with the hammer, but it was ineffectual. A struggle ensued. The\nroom was plunged in darkness. Gabrielle waited outside. After a little,\nher husband called for a light; she came in and lit a candle on the\nmantelpiece. Fenayrou was getting the worst of the encounter. She ran\nto his help, and dragged off his opponent. Fenayrou was free. He struck\nagain with the hammer. Aubert fell, and for some ten minutes Fenayrou\nstood over the battered and bleeding man abusing and insulting\nhim, exulting in his vengeance. Then he stabbed him twice with the\nsword-stick, and so ended the business.\n\nThe murderers had to wait till past eleven to get rid of the body, as\nthe streets were full of holiday-makers. When all was quiet they put it\ninto the goat chaise, wrapped round with the gas-piping, and wheeled it\non to the Chatou bridge. To prevent noise they let the body down by a\nrope into the water. It was heavier than they thought, and fell with a\nloud splash into the river. \"Hullo!\" exclaimed a night-fisherman, who\nwas mending his tackle not far from the bridge, \"there go those butchers\nagain, chucking their filth into the Seine!\"\n\nAs soon as they had taken the chaise back to the villa, the three\nassassins hurried to the station to catch the last train. Arriving there\na little before their time, they went into a neighbouring cafe. Fenayrou\nhad three bocks, Lucien one, and Madame another glass of chartreuse.\nSo home to Paris. Lucien reached his house about two in the morning.\n\"Well,\" asked his wife, \"did you have a good day?\" \"Splendid,\" was the\nreply.\n\nEleven days passed. Fenayrou paid a visit to the villa to clean it\nand put it in order. Otherwise he went about his business as usual,\nattending race meetings, indulging in a picnic and a visit to the Salon.\nOn May 27 a man named Bailly, who, by a strange coincidence, was\nknown by the nickname of \"the Chemist,\" walking by the river, had his\nattention called by a bargeman to a corpse that was floating on the\nwater. He fished it out. It was that of Aubert. In spite of a gag tired\nover his mouth the water had got into the body, and, notwithstanding the\nweight of the lead piping, it had risen to the surface.\n\nAs soon as the police had been informed of the disappearance of Aubert,\ntheir suspicions had fallen on the Fenayrous in consequence of the\nrequest which Marin Fenayrou had made to the commissary of police to\naid him in the recovery from Aubert of his wife's letters. But there\nhad been nothing further in their conduct to provoke suspicion. When,\nhowever, the body was discovered and at the same time an anonymous\nletter received denouncing the Fenayrous as the murderers of Aubert, the\npolice decided on their arrest. On the morning of June 8 M. Mace,\nthen head of the Detective Department, called at their house. He found\nFenayrou in a dressing-gown. This righteous avenger of his wife's\nseduction denied his guilt, like any common criminal, but M. Mace handed\nhim over to one of his men, to be taken immediately to Versailles. He\nhimself took charge of Madame, and, in the first-class carriage full of\npeople, in which they travelled together to Versailles, she whispered to\nthe detective a full confession of the crime.\n\nMace has left us an account of this singular railway journey. It was two\no'clock in the afternoon. In the carriage were five ladies and a young\nman who was reading La Vie Parisienne. Mme. Fenayrou was silent and\nthoughtful. \"You're thinking of your present position?\" asked the\ndetective. \"No, I'm thinking of my mother and my dear children.\" \"They\ndon't seem to care much about their father,\" remarked Mace. \"Perhaps\nnot.\" \"Why?\" asked M. Mace. \"Because of his violent temper,\" was the\nreply. After some further conversation and the departure at Courbevoie\nof the young man with La Vie Parisienne, Mme. Fenayrou asked abruptly:\n\"Do you think my husband guilty?\" \"I'm sure of it.\" \"So does Aubert's\nsister.\" \"Certainly,\" answered M. Mace; \"she looks on the crime as one\nof revenge.\" \"But my brother-in-law,\" urged the woman, \"could have had\nno motive for vengeance against Aubert.\" Mace answered coldly that he\nwould have to explain how he had employed his time on Ascension Day.\n\"You see criminals everywhere,\" answered Madame.\n\nAfter the train had left St. Cloud, where the other occupants of the\ncarriage had alighted, the detective and his prisoner were alone, free\nof interruption till Versailles should be reached. Hitherto they had\nspoken in whispers; now Mace seized the opportunity to urge the woman to\nunbosom herself to him, to reveal her part in the crime. She burst into\ntears. There was an interval of silence; then she thanked Mace for the\nkindness and consideration he had shown her. \"You wish me,\" she asked,\n\"to betray my husband?\" \"Without any design or intention on your\npart,\" discreetly answered the detective; \"but by the sole force of\ncircumstances you are placed in such a position that you cannot help\nbetraying him.\"\n\nWhether convinced or not of this tyranny of circumstance, Mme. Fenayrou\nobeyed her mentor, and calmly, coldly, without regret or remorse, told\nhim the story of the assassination. Towards the end of her narration she\nsoftened a little. \"I know I am a criminal,\" she exclaimed. \"Since this\nmorning I have done nothing but lie. I am sick of it; it makes me\nsuffer too much. Don't tell my husband until this evening that I have\nconfessed; there's no need, for, after what I have told you, you can\neasily expose his falsehoods and so get at the truth.\"\n\nThat evening the three prisoners--Lucien had been arrested at the\nsame time as the other two--were brought to Chatou. Identified by\nthe gardener as the lessee of the villa, Fenayrou abandoned his\nprotestations of innocence and admitted his guilt. The crime was then\nand there reconstituted in the presence of the examining magistrate.\nWith the help of a gendarme, who impersonated Aubert, Fenayrou repeated\nthe incidents of the murder. The goat-chaise was wheeled to the bridge,\nand there in the presence of an indignant crowd, the murderer showed how\nthe body had been lowered into the river.\n\nAfter a magisterial investigation lasting two months, which failed\nto shed any new light on the more mysterious elements in the case,\nFenayrou, his wife and brother were indicted on August 19 before the\nAssize Court for the Seine-et-Oise Department, sitting at Versailles.\n\nThe attitude of the three culprits was hardly such as to provoke the\nsympathies of even a French jury. Fenayrou seemed to be giving a clumsy\nand unconvincing performance of the role of the wronged husband; his\nheavy figure clothed in an ill-fitting suit of \"blue dittos,\" his\nill-kempt red beard and bock-stained moustache did not help him in his\nimpersonation. Mme. Fenayrou, pale, colourless, insignificant, was cold\nand impenetrable. She described the murder of her lover \"as if she were\ngiving her cook a household recipe for making apricot Jam.\" Lucien was\nhumble and lachrymose.\n\nIn his interrogatory of the husband the President, M. Berard des\nGlajeux, showed himself frankly sceptical as to the ingenuousness of\nFenayrou's motives in assassinating Aubert. \"Now, what was the motive of\nthis horrible crime?\" he asked. \"Revenge,\" answered Fenayrou.\n\nPresident: But consider the care you took to hide the body and destroy\nall trace of your guilt; that is not the way in which a husband sets out\nto avenge his honour; these are the methods of the assassin! With your\nwife's help you could have caught Aubert in flagrante delicto and killed\nhim on the spot, and the law would have absolved you. Instead of\nwhich you decoy him into a hideous snare. Public opinion suggests that\njealousy of your former assistant's success, and mortification at your\nown failure, were the real motives. Or was it not perhaps that you had\nbeen in the habit of rendering somewhat dubious services to some of your\npromiscuous clients?\n\nFenayrou: Nothing of the kind, I swear it!\n\nPresident: Do not protest too much. Remember that among your\nacquaintances you were suspected of cheating at cards. As a chemist you\nhad been convinced of fraud. Perhaps Aubert knew something against you.\nSome act of poisoning, or abortion, in which you had been concerned?\nMany witnesses have believed this.\n\nYour mother-in-law is said to have remarked, \"My son-in-law will end in\njail.\"\n\nFenayrou (bursting into tears): This is too dreadful.\n\nPresident: And Dr. Durand, an old friend of Aubert, remembers the\ndeceased saying to him, \"One has nothing to fear from people one holds\nin one's hands.\"\n\nFenayrou: I don't know what he meant.\n\nPresident: Or, considering the cruelty, cowardice, the cold calculation\ndisplayed in the commission of the crime, shall we say this was a\nwoman's not a man's revenge. You have said your wife acted as your\nslave--was it not the other way about?\n\nFenayrou: No; it was my revenge, mine alone.\n\nThe view that regarded Mme. Fenayrou as a soft, malleable paste was not\nthe view of the President.\n\n\"Why,\" he asked the woman, \"did you commit this horrible murder, decoy\nyour lover to his death?\" \"Because I had repented,\" was the answer; \"I\nhad wronged my husband, and since he had been condemned for fraud,\nI loved him the more for being unfortunate. And then I feared for my\nchildren.\"\n\nPresident: Is that really the case?\n\nMme. Fenayrou: Certainly it is.\n\nPresident: Then your whole existence has been one of lies and hypocrisy.\nWhilst you were deceiving your husband and teaching your children to\ndespise him you were covering him with caresses.\n\nYou have played false to both husband and lover--to Aubert in decoying\nhim to his death, to your husband by denouncing him directly you were\narrested. You have betrayed everybody. The only person you have not\nbetrayed is yourself. What sort of a woman are you? As you and Aubert\nwent into the drawing-room on the evening of the murder you said loudly,\n\"This is the way,\" so that your husband, hearing your voice outside,\nshould not strike you by mistake in the darkness. If Lucien had not told\nus that you attacked Aubert whilst he was struggling with your husband,\nwe should never have known it, for you would never have admitted it, and\nyour husband has all along refused to implicate you.... You have said\nthat you had ceased to care for your lover: he had ceased to care for\nyou. He was prosperous, happy, about to marry: you hated him, and you\nshowed your hate when, during the murder, you flung yourself upon him\nand cried, \"Wretch!\" Is that the behaviour of a woman who represents\nherself to have been the timid slave of her husband? No. This crime is\nthe revenge of a cowardly and pitiless woman, who writes down in her\naccount book the expenses of the trip to Chatou and, after the murder,\npicnics merrily in the green fields. It was you who steeled your husband\nto the task.\n\nHow far the President was justified in thus inverting the parts played\nby the husband and wife in the crime must be a matter of opinion. In his\nvolume of Souvenirs M. Berard des Glajeux modifies considerably the view\nwhich he perhaps felt it his duty to express in his interrogatory of\nGabrielle Fenayrou. He describes her as soft and flexible by nature, the\nrepentant slave of her husband, seeking to atone for her wrong to him\nby helping him in his revenge. The one feature in the character of\nMme. Fenayrou that seems most clearly demonstrated is its absolute\ninsensibility under any circumstances whatsoever.\n\nThe submissive Lucien had little to say for himself, nor could any\nmotive for joining in the murder beyond a readiness to oblige his\nbrother be suggested. In his Souvenirs M. Berard des Glajeux states that\nto-day it would seem to be clearly established that Lucien acted blindly\nat the bidding of his sister-in-law, \"qu'il avait beaucoup aimee et qui\nn'avait pas ete cruelle a son egard.\"\n\nThe evidence recapitulated for the most part the facts already set\nout. The description of Mme. Fenayrou by the gentleman on the sporting\nnewspaper who had succeeded Aubert in her affections is, under the\ncircumstances, interesting: \"She was sad, melancholy; I questioned\nher, and she told me she was married to a coarse man who neglected her,\nfailed to understand her, and had never loved her. I became her lover\nbut, except on a few occasions, our relations were those of good\nfriends. She was a woman with few material wants, affectionate,\nexpansive, an idealist, one who had suffered much and sought from\nwithout a happiness her marriage had never brought her. I believe her to\nhave been the blind tool of her husband.\"\n\nFrom motives of delicacy the evidence of this gentleman was read in\nhis presence; he was not examined orally. His eulogy of his mistress\nis loyal. Against it may be set the words of the Procureur de la\nRepublique, M. Delegorgue: \"Never has a more thorough-paced, a more\nhideous monster been seated in the dock of an assize court. This woman\nis the personification of falsehood, depravity, cowardice and treachery.\nShe is worthy of the supreme penalty.\" The jury were not of this\nopinion. They preferred to regard Mme. Fenayrou as playing a secondary\npart to that of her husband. They accorded in both her case and that\nof Lucien extenuating circumstances. The woman was sentenced to penal\nservitude for life, Lucien to seven years. Fenayrou, for whose conduct\nthe jury could find no extenuation, was condemned to death.\n\nIt is the custom in certain assize towns for the President, after\npronouncing sentence, to visit a prisoner who had been ordered for\nexecution. M. Berard des Glajeux describes his visit to Fenayrou at\nVersailles. He was already in prison dress, sobbing.\n\nHis iron nature, which during five days had never flinched, had\nbroken down; but it was not for himself he wept, but for his wife, his\nchildren, his brother; of his own fate he took no account. At the same\nmoment his wife was in the lodge of the courthouse waiting for the cab\nthat was to take her to her prison. Freed from the anxieties of the\ntrial, knowing her life to be spared, without so much as a thought for\nthe husband whom she had never loved, she had tidied herself up, and\nnow, with all the ease of a woman, whose misfortunes have not destroyed\nher self-possession, was doing the honours of the jail. It was she who\nreceived her judge.\n\nBut Fenayrou was not to die. The Court of Cassation, to which he had\nmade the usual appeal after condemnation, decided that the proceedings\nat Versailles had been vitiated by the fact that the evidence of\nGabrielle Fenayrou's second lover had not been taken ORALLY, within the\nrequirements of the criminal code; consequently a new trial was ordered\nbefore the Paris Assize Court. This second trial, which commenced on\nOctober 12, saved Fenayrou's head. The Parisian jury showed themselves\nmore lenient than their colleagues at Versailles. Not only was Fenayrou\naccorded extenuating circumstances, but Lucien was acquitted altogether.\nThe only person to whom these new proceedings brought no benefit was\nMme. Fenayrou, whose sentence remained unaltered.\n\nMarin Fenayrou was sent to New Caledonia to serve his punishment.\n\nThere he was allowed to open a dispensary, but, proving dishonest, he\nlost his license and became a ferryman--a very Charon for terrestrial\npassengers. He died in New Caledonia of cancer of the liver.\n\nGabrielle Fenayrou made an exemplary prisoner, so exemplary that, owing\nto her good conduct and a certain ascendancy she exercised over her\nfellow-prisoners, she was made forewoman of one of the workshops. Whilst\nholding this position she had the honour of receiving, among those\nentrusted to her charge, another Gabrielle, murderess, Gabrielle\nBompard, the history of whose crime is next to be related.\n\n\n\n\nEyraud and Bompard\n\n\nThere are accounts of this case in Bataille \"Causes Criminelles et\nMondaines,\" 1890, and in Volume X. of Fouquier \"Causes Celebres.\"\n\"L'Affaire Gouffe\" by Dr. Lacassagne, Lyons, 1891, and Goron \"L'Amour\nCriminel\" may be consulted.\n\nON July 27, in the year 1889, the Parisian police were informed of the\ndisappearance of one Gouffe, a bailiff. He had been last seen by two\nfriends on the Boulevard Montmartre at about ten minutes past seven on\nthe evening of the 26th, a Friday. Since then nothing had been heard of\nhim, either at his office in the Rue Montmartre, or at his private\nhouse in the Rue Rougemont. This was surprising in the case of a man of\nregular habits even in his irregularities, robust health, and cheerful\nspirits.\n\nGouffe was a widower, forty-two years of age. He had three daughters\nwho lived happily with him in the Rue Rougemont. He did a good trade as\nbailiff and process-server, and at times had considerable sums of money\nin his possession. These he would never leave behind him at his office,\nbut carry home at the end of the day's work, except on Fridays. Friday\nnights Gouffe always spent away from home. As the society he sought\non these nights was of a promiscuous character, he was in the habit\nof leaving at his office any large sum of money that had come into his\nhands during the day.\n\nAbout nine o'clock on this particular Friday night, July 26, the\nhall-porter at Gouffe's office in the Rue Montmartre heard someone, whom\nhe had taken at first to be the bailiff himself, enter the hall and go\nupstairs to the office, where he remained a few minutes. As he descended\nthe stairs the porter came out of his lodge and, seeing it was a\nstranger, accosted him. But the man hurried away without giving the\nporter time to see his face.\n\nWhen the office was examined the next day everything was found in\nperfect order, and a sum of 14,000 francs, hidden away behind some\npapers, untouched. The safe had not been tampered with; there was, in\nshort, nothing unusual about the room except ten long matches that were\nlying half burnt on the floor.\n\nOn hearing of the bailiff's disappearance and the mysterious visitor\nto his office, the police, who were convinced that Gouffe had been the\nvictim of some criminal design, inquired closely into his habits, his\nfriends, his associates, men and women. But the one man who could have\nbreathed the name that would have set the police on the track of the\nreal culprits was, for reasons of his own, silent. The police examined\nmany persons, but without arriving at any useful result.\n\nHowever, on August 15, in a thicket at the foot of a slope running down\nfrom the road that passes through the district of Millery, about\nten miles from Lyons, a roadmender, attracted by a peculiar smell,\ndiscovered the remains of what appeared to be a human body. They were\nwrapped in a cloth, but so decomposed as to make identification almost\nimpossible. M. Goron, at that time head of the Parisian detective\npolice, believed them to be the remains of Gouffe, but a relative of the\nmissing man, whom he sent to Lyons, failed to identify them. Two days\nafter the discovery of the corpse, there were found near Millery the\nbroken fragments of a trunk, the lock of which fitted a key that had\nbeen picked up near the body. A label on the trunk showed that it had\nbeen dispatched from Paris to Lyons on July 27, 188--, but the final\nfigure of the date was obliterated. Reference to the books of the\nrailway company showed that on July 27, 1889, the day following the\ndisappearance of Gouffe, a trunk similar in size and weight to that\nfound near Millery had been sent from Paris to Lyons.\n\nThe judicial authorities at Lyons scouted the idea that either the\ncorpse or the trunk found at Millery had any connection with the\ndisappearance of Gouffe. When M. Goron, bent on following up what he\nbelieved to be important clues, went himself to Lyons he found that\nthe remains, after being photographed, had been interred in the common\nburying-ground. The young doctor who had made the autopsy produced\ntriumphantly some hair taken from the head of the corpse and showed M.\nGoron that whilst Gouffe's hair was admittedly auburn and cut short,\nthis was black, and had evidently been worn long. M. Goron, after\nlooking carefully at the hair, asked for some distilled water. He put\nthe lock of hair into it and, after a few minutes' immersion, cleansed\nof the blood, grease and dust that had caked them together, the hairs\nappeared clearly to be short and auburn. The doctor admitted his error.\n\nFortified by this success, Goron was able to procure the exhumation of\nthe body. A fresh autopsy was performed by Dr. Lacassagne, the eminent\nmedical jurist of the Lyons School of Medicine. He was able to pronounce\nwith certainty that the remains were those of the bailiff, Gouffe. An\ninjury to the right ankle, a weakness of the right leg, the absence of\na particular tooth and other admitted peculiarities in Gouffe's physical\nconformation, were present in the corpse, placing its identity beyond\nquestion. This second post-mortem revealed furthermore an injury to the\nthyroid cartilage of the larynx that had been inflicted beyond any doubt\nwhatever, declared Dr. Lacassagne, before death.\n\nThere was little reason to doubt that Gouffe had been the victim of\nmurder by strangulation.\n\nBut by whom had the crime been committed? It was now the end of\nNovember. Four months had passed since the bailiff's murder, and the\npolice had no clue to its perpetrators. At one time a friend of Gouffe's\nhad been suspected and placed under arrest, but he was released for want\nof evidence.\n\nOne day toward the close of November, in the course of a conversation\nwith M. Goron, a witness who had known Gouffe surprised him by saying\nabruptly, \"There's another man who disappeared about the same time as\nGouffe.\" M. Goron pricked up his ears. The witness explained that he\nhad not mentioned the fact before, as he had not connected it with his\nfriend's disappearance; the man's name, he said, was Eyraud, Michel\nEyraud, M. Goron made some inquires as to this Michel Eyraud. He learnt\nthat he was a married man, forty-six years of age, once a distiller at\nSevres, recently commission-agent to a bankrupt firm, that he had left\nFrance suddenly, about the time of the disappearance of Gouffe, and that\nhe had a mistress, one Gabrielle Bompard, who had disappeared with him.\nInstinctively M. Goron connected this fugitive couple with the fate of\nthe murdered bailiff.\n\nConfirmation of his suspicions was to come from London. The remains of\nthe trunk found at Millery had been skilfully put together and exposed\nat the Morgue in Paris, whilst the Gouffe family had offered a reward\nof 500 francs to anybody who could in any way identify the trunk. Beyond\nproducing a large crop of anonymous letters, in one of which the crime\nwas attributed to General Boulanger, then in Jersey, these measures\nseemed likely to prove fruitless. But one day in December, from the\nkeeper of a boarding-house in Gower Street, M. Goron received a letter\ninforming him that the writer believed that Eyraud and Gabrielle Bompard\nhad stayed recently at his house, and that on July 14 the woman, whom he\nknew only as \"Gabrielle,\" had left for France, crossing by Newhaven and\nDieppe, and taking with her a large and almost empty trunk, which\nshe had purchased in London. Inquires made by the French detectives\nestablished the correctness of this correspondent's information. An\nassistant at a trunk shop in the Euston Road was able to identify the\ntrunk--brought over from Paris for the purpose--as one purchased in his\nshop on July 12 by a Frenchman answering to the description of Michel\nEyraud. The wife of the boarding-house keeper recollected having\nexpressed to Gabrielle her surprise that she should buy such an enormous\npiece of luggage when she had only one dress to put into it. \"Oh that's\nall right,\" answered Gabrielle smilingly, \"we shall have plenty to fill\nit with in Paris!\" Gabrielle had gone to Paris with the trunk on July\n14, come back to London on the 17th, and on the 20th she and Eyraud\nreturned together to Paris From these facts it seemed more than probable\nthat these two were the assassins so eagerly sought for by the police,\nand it seemed clear also that the murder had been done in Paris. But\nwhat had become of this couple, in what street, in what house in Paris\nhad the crime been committed? These were questions the police were\npowerless to answer.\n\nThe year 1889 came to an end, the murderers were still at large. But\non January 21, 1890, M. Goron found lying on his table a large letter\nbearing the New York postmark. He opened it, and to his astonishment\nread at the end the signature \"Michel Eyraud.\" It was a curious letter,\nbut undoubtedly genuine. In it Eyraud protested against the suspicions\ndirected against himself; they were, he wrote, merely unfortunate\ncoincidences. Gouffe had been his friend; he had had no share whatever\nin his death; his only misfortune had been his association with \"that\nserpent, Gabrielle Bompard.\" He had certainly bought a large trunk for\nher, but she told him that she had sold it. They had gone to America\ntogether, he to avoid financial difficulties in which he had been\ninvolved by the dishonesty of the Jews. There Gabrielle had deserted him\nfor another man. He concluded a very long letter by declaring his belief\nin Gabrielle's innocence--\"the great trouble with her is that she is\nsuch a liar and also has a dozen lovers after her.\" He promised that, as\nsoon as he learnt that Gabrielle had returned to Paris, he would, of his\nown free will, place himself in the hands of M. Goron.\n\nHe was to have an early opportunity of redeeming his pledge, for on\nthe day following the receipt of his letter a short, well-made woman,\ndressed neatly in black, with dyed hair, greyish-blue eyes, good teeth,\na disproportionately large head and a lively and intelligent expression\nof face, presented herself at the Prefecture of Police and asked for an\ninterview with the Prefect.\n\nRequested to give her name, she replied, with a smile, \"Gabrielle\nBompard.\" She was accompanied by a middle-aged gentleman, who appeared\nto be devoted to her. Gabrielle Bompard and her friend were taken to the\nprivate room of M. Loze, the Prefect of Police. There, in a half-amused\nway, without the least concern, sitting at times on the edge of the\nPrefect's writing-table, Gabrielle Bompard told how she had been the\nunwilling accomplice of her lover, Eyraud, in the murder of the bailiff,\nGouffe. The crime, she stated, had been committed in No. 3 in the Rue\nTronson-Ducoudray, but she had not been present; she knew nothing of\nit but what had been told her by Eyraud. After the murder she had\naccompanied him to America; there they had met the middle-aged\ngentleman, her companion. Eyraud had proposed that they should murder\nand rob him, but she had divulged the plot to the gentleman and asked\nhim to take her away. It was acting on his advice that she had returned\nto France, determined to give her evidence to the judicial authorities\nin Paris. The middle-aged gentleman declared himself ready to vouch for\nthe truth of a great part of this interesting narrative. There they both\nimagined apparently that the affair would be ended. They were extremely\nsurprised when the Prefect, after listening to their statements, sent\nfor a detective-inspector who showed Gabrielle Bompard a warrant for\nher arrest. After an affecting parting, at least on the part of the\nmiddle-aged gentleman, Gabrielle Bompard was taken to prison. There\nshe soon recovered her spirits, which had at no time been very gravely\ndepressed by her critical situation.\n\nAccording to Eyraud's letters, if anyone knew anything about Gouffe's\nmurder, it was Gabrielle Bompard; according to the woman's statement,\nit was Eyraud, and Eyraud alone, who had committed it. As they were both\nliars--the woman perhaps the greater liar of the two--their statements\nare not to be taken as other than forlorn attempts to shift the blame on\nto each other's shoulders.\n\nBefore extracting from their various avowals, which grew more complete\nas time went on, the story of the crime, let us follow Eyraud in his\nflight from justice, which terminated in the May of 1890 by his arrest\nin Havana.\n\nImmediately after the arrest of Gabrielle, two French detectives set out\nfor America to trace and run down if possible her deserted lover. For\nmore than a month they traversed Canada and the United States in search\nof their prey. The track of the fugitive was marked from New York to San\nFrancisco by acts of thieving and swindling. At the former city he had\nmade the acquaintance of a wealthy Turk, from whom, under the pretence\nof wishing to be photographed in it, he had borrowed a magnificent\noriental robe. The photograph was taken, but Eyraud forgot to return the\ncostly robe.\n\nAt another time he was lodging in the same house as a young American\nactor, called in the French accounts of the incident \"Sir Stout.\"\nTo \"Sir Stout\" Eyraud would appear to have given a most convincing\nperformance of the betrayed husband; his wife, he said, had deserted him\nfor another man; he raved and stormed audibly in his bedroom, deploring\nhis fate and vowing vengeance. These noisy representations so impressed\n\"Sir Stout\" that, on the outraged husband declaring himself to be a\nMexican for the moment without funds, the benevolent comedian lent him\neighty dollars, which, it is almost needless to add, he never saw\nagain. In narrating this incident to the French detectives, \"Sir Stout\"\ndescribes Eyraud's performance as great, surpassing even those of\nCoquelin.\n\nSimilar stories of theft and debauchery met the detectives at every\nturn, but, helped in a great measure by the publicity the American\nnewspapers gave to the movements of his pursuers, Eyraud was able to\nelude them, and in March they returned to France to concert further\nplans for his capture.\n\nEyraud had gone to Mexico. From there he had written a letter to M.\nRochefort's newspaper, L'Intransigeant, in which he declared Gouffe\nto have been murdered by Gabrielle and an unknown. But, when official\ninquiries were made in Mexico as to his whereabouts, the bird had flown.\n\nAt Havana, in Cuba, there lived a French dressmaker and clothes-merchant\nnamed Puchen. In the month of February a stranger, ragged and unkempt,\nbut evidently a fellow-countryman, visited her shop and offered to sell\nher a superb Turkish costume. The contrast between the wretchedness of\nthe vendor and the magnificence of his wares struck Madame Puchen at the\ntime. But her surprise was converted into suspicion when she read in\nthe American newspapers a description of the Turkish garment stolen by\nMichel Eyraud, the reputed assassin of the bailiff Gouffe. It was one\nmorning in the middle of May that Mme. Puchen read the description of\nthe robe that had been offered her in February by her strange visitor.\nTo her astonishment, about two o'clock the same afternoon, she saw the\nstranger standing before her door. She beckoned to him, and asked him\nif he still had his Turkish robe with him; he seemed confused, and said\nthat he had sold it. The conversation drifted on to ordinary topics;\nthe stranger described some of his recent adventures in Mexico. \"Oh!\"\nexclaimed the dressmaker, \"they say Eyraud, the murderer, is in Mexico!\nDid you come across him? Were you in Paris at the time of the murder?\"\nThe stranger answered in the negative, but his face betrayed his\nuneasiness. \"Do you know you're rather like him?\" said the woman, in\na half-joking way. The stranger laughed, and shortly after went out,\nsaying he would return. He did return on May 15, bringing with him\na number of the Republique Illustree that contained an almost\nunrecognisable portrait of Eyraud. He said he had picked it up in a\ncafe. \"What a blackguard he looks!\" he exclaimed as he threw the paper\non the table. But the dressmaker's suspicions were not allayed by the\nstranger's uncomplimentary reference to the murderer. As soon as he had\ngone, she went to the French Consul and told him her story.\n\nBy one of those singular coincidences that are inadmissable in fiction\nor drama, but occur at times in real life, there happened to be in\nHavana, of all places, a man who had been employed by Eyraud at the time\nthat he had owned a distillery at Sevres. The Consul, on hearing the\nstatement of Mme. Puchen, sent for this man and told him that a person\nbelieved to be Eyraud was in Havana. As the man left the Consulate, whom\nshould he meet in the street but Eyraud himself! The fugitive had been\nwatching the movements of Mme. Puchen; he had suspected, after the\ninterview, that the woman would denounce him to the authorities. He now\nsaw that disguise was useless. He greeted his ex-employe, took him into\na cafe, there admitted his identity and begged him not to betray him.\nIt was midnight when they left the cafe. Eyraud, repenting of his\nconfidence, and no doubt anxious to rid himself of a dangerous witness,\ntook his friend into an ill-lighted and deserted street; but the friend,\nconscious of his delicate situation, hailed a passing cab and made off\nas quickly as he could.\n\nNext day, the 20th, the search for Eyraud was set about in earnest. The\nSpanish authorities, informed of his presence in Havana, directed the\npolice to spare no effort to lay hands on him. The Hotel Roma, at which\nhe had been staying, was visited; but Eyraud, scenting danger, had gone\nto an hotel opposite the railway station. His things were packed ready\nfor flight on the following morning. How was he to pass the night? True\nto his instincts, a house of ill-fame, at which he had been entertained\nalready, seemed the safest and most pleasant refuge; but, when, seedy\nand shabby, he presented himself at the door, he was sent back into the\nstreet. It was past one in the morning. The lonely murderer wandered\naimlessly in the streets, restless, nervous, a prey to apprehension,\nnot knowing where to go. Again the man from Sevres met him. \"It's all\nup with me!\" said Eyraud, and disappeared in the darkness. At two in the\nmorning a police officer, who had been patrolling the town in search of\nthe criminal, saw, in the distance, a man walking to and fro, seemingly\nuncertain which way to turn. Hearing footsteps the man turned round and\nwalked resolutely past the policeman, saying good-night in Spanish.\n\"Who are you? What's your address?\" the officer asked abruptly. \"Gorski,\nHotel Roma!\" was the answer. This was enough for the officer. Eyraud was\nknow{sic} to have passed as \"Gorski,\" the Hotel Roma had already been\nsearched as one of his hiding-places. To seize and handcuff \"Gorski\"\nwas the work of a moment. An examination of the luggage left by the\nso-called Gorski at his last hotel and a determined attempt at suicide\nmade by their prisoner during the night proved conclusively that to the\nSpanish police was the credit of having laid by the heels, ten months\nafter the commission of the crime, Michel Eyraud, one of the assassins\nof the bailiff Gouffe.\n\nOn June 16 Eyraud was delivered over to the French police. He reached\nFrance on the 20th, and on July 1 made his first appearance before the\nexamining magistrate.\n\nIt will be well at this point in the narrative to describe how Eyraud\nand Gabrielle Bompard came to be associated together in crime. Gabrielle\nBompard was twenty-two years of age at the time of her arrest, the\nfourth child of a merchant of Lille, a strong, hardworking, respectable\nman. Her mother, a delicate woman, had died of lung disease when\nGabrielle was thirteen. Even as a child lying and vicious, thinking only\nof men and clothes, Gabrielle, after being expelled as incorrigible from\nfour educational establishments, stayed at a fifth for some three years.\nThere she astonished those in authority over her by her precocious\npropensity for vice, her treacherous and lying disposition, and a\nlewdness of tongue rare in one of her age and comparative inexperience.\nAt eighteen she returned to her father's house, only to quit it for a\nlover whom, she alleged, had hypnotised and then seduced her. Gabrielle\nwas singularly susceptible to hypnotic suggestion. Her father implored\nthe family doctor to endeavour to persuade her, while in the hypnotic\nstate, to reform her deplorable conduct. The doctor did his best but\nwith no success. He declared Gabrielle to be a neuropath, who had not\nfound in her home such influences as would have tended to overcome her\nvicious instincts. Perhaps the doctor was inclined to sympathise rather\ntoo readily with his patient, if we are to accept the report of those\ndistinguished medical gentlemen who, at a later date, examined carefully\ninto the mental and physical characteristics of Gabrielle Bompard.\n\nThis girl of twenty had developed into a supreme instance of the\n\"unmoral\" woman, the conscienceless egoist, morally colour-blind, vain,\nlewd, the intelligence quick and alert but having no influence whatever\non conduct. One instance will suffice to show the sinister levity, the\nutter absence of all moral sense in this strange creature.\n\nAfter the murder of Gouffe, Gabrielle spent the night alone with the\ntrunk containing the bailiff's corpse. Asked by M. Goron what were her\nsensations during this ghastly vigil, she replied with a smile, \"You'd\nnever guess what a funny idea come into my head! You see it was not very\npleasant for me being thus tete-a-tete with a corpse, I couldn't sleep.\nSo I thought what fun it would be to go into the street and pick up some\nrespectable gentleman from the provinces. I'd bring him up to the room,\nand just as he was beginning to enjoy himself say, 'Would you like to\nsee a bailiff?' open the trunk suddenly and, before he could recover\nfrom his horror, run out into the street and fetch the police. Just\nthink what a fool the respectable gentleman would have looked when the\nofficers came!\"\n\nSuch callousness is almost unsurpassed in the annals of criminal\ninsensibility. Nero fiddling over burning Rome, Thurtell fresh from the\nmurder of Weare, inviting Hunt, the singer and his accomplice, to \"tip\nthem a stave\" after supper, Edwards, the Camberwell murderer, reading\nwith gusto to friends the report of a fashionable divorce case, post\nfrom the murder of a young married couple and their baby--even examples\nsuch as these pale before the levity of the \"little demon,\" as the\nFrench detectives christened Gabrielle.\n\nSuch was Gabrielle Bompard when, on July 26, exactly one year to a day\nbefore the murder of Gouffe, she met in Paris Michel Eyraud. These two\nwere made for each other. If Gabrielle were unmoral, Eyraud was immoral.\nForty-six at the time of Gouffe's murder, he was sufficiently practised\nin vice to appreciate and enjoy the flagrantly vicious propensities\nof the young Gabrielle. All his life Eyraud had spent his substance in\ndebauchery. His passions were violent and at times uncontrollable,\nbut unlike many remarkable men of a similar temperament, this strong\nanimalism was not in his case accompanied by a capacity for vigorous\nintellectual exertion or a great power of work. \"Understand this,\" said\nEyraud to one of the detectives who brought him back to France, \"I have\nnever done any work, and I never will do any work.\" To him work was\nderogatory; better anything than that. Unfortunately it could not be\navoided altogether, but with Eyraud such work as he was compelled at\ndifferent times to endure was only a means for procuring money for\nhis degraded pleasures, and when honest work became too troublesome,\ndishonesty served in its stead. When he met Gabrielle he was almost at\nthe end of his tether, bankrupt and discredited. At a pinch he might\nsqueeze a little money out of his wife, with whom he continued to live\nin spite of his open infidelities.\n\nSave for such help as he could get from her small dowry, he was without\nresources. A deserter from the army during the Mexican war in 1869, he\nhad since then engaged in various commercial enterprises, all of\nwhich had failed, chiefly through his own extravagance, violence and\ndishonesty. Gabrielle was quick to empty his pockets of what little\nremained in them. The proceeds of her own immorality, which Eyraud\nwas quite ready to share, soon proved insufficient to replenish them.\nConfronted with ruin, Eyraud and Gompard hit on a plan by which the\nwoman should decoy some would-be admirer to a convenient trysting-place.\nThere, dead or alive, the victim was to be made the means of supplying\ntheir wants.\n\nOn further reflection dead seemed more expedient than alive, extortion\nfrom a living victim too risky an enterprise. Their plans were carefully\nprepared. Gabrielle was to hire a ground-floor apartment, so that any\nnoise, such as footsteps or the fall of a body, would not be heard by\npersons living underneath.\n\nAt the beginning of July, 1889, Eyraud and Bompard were in London. There\nthey bought at a West End draper's a red and white silk girdle, and at\na shop in Gower Street a large travelling trunk. They bought, also in\nLondon, about thirteen feet of cording, a pulley and, on returning to\nParis on July 20, some twenty feet of packing-cloth, which Gabrielle,\nsitting at her window on the fine summer evenings, sewed up into a large\nbag.\n\nThe necessary ground-floor apartment had been found at No. 3 Rue\nTronson-Ducoudray. Here Gabrielle installed herself on July 24. The\nbedroom was convenient for the assassins' purpose, the bed standing in\nan alcove separated by curtains from the rest of the room. To the beam\nforming the crosspiece at the entrance into the alcove Eyraud fixed a\npulley. Through the pulley ran a rope, having at one end of it a swivel,\nso that a man, hiding behind the curtains could, by pulling the rope\nstrongly, haul up anything that might be attached to the swivel at the\nother end. It was with the help of this simple piece of mechanism and a\ngood long pull from Eyraud that the impecunious couple hoped to refill\ntheir pockets.\n\nThe victim was chosen on the 25th. Eyraud had already known of Gouffe's\nexistence, but on that day, Thursday, in a conversation with a common\nfriend, Eyraud learnt that the bailiff Gouffe was rich, that he was in\nthe habit of having considerable sums of money in his care, and that on\nFriday nights Gouffe made it his habit to sleep from home. There was no\ntime to lose. The next day Gabrielle accosted Gouffe as he was going to\nhis dejeuner and, after some little conversation agreed to meet him at\neight o'clock that evening.\n\nThe afternoon was spent in preparing for the bailiff's reception in the\nRue Tronson-Ducoudray. A lounge-chair was so arranged that it stood with\nits back to the alcove, within which the pulley and rope had been\nfixed by Eyraud. Gouffe was to sit on the chair, Gabrielle on his knee.\nGabrielle was then playfully to slip round his neck, in the form of a\nnoose, the cord of her dressing gown and, unseen by him, attach one end\nof it to the swivel of the rope held by Eyraud. Her accomplice had only\nto give a strong pull and the bailiff's course was run.(17)\n\n\n     (17) One writer on the case has suggested that the story of the murder\nby rope and pulley was invented by Eyraud and Bompard to mitigate the\nfull extent of their guilt, and that the bailiff was strangled while\nin bed with the woman. But the purchase of the necessary materials in\nLondon would seem to imply a more practical motive for the use of rope\nand pulley.\n\n\nAt six o'clock Eyraud and Bompard dined together, after which Eyraud\nreturned to the apartment, whilst Bompard went to meet Gouffe near the\nMadeline Church. What occurred afterwards at No. 3 Rue Tronson-Ducoudray\nis best described in the statement made by Eyraud at his trial.\n\n\"At a quarter past eight there was a ring at the bell. I hid myself\nbehind the curtain. Gouffe came in. 'You've a nice little nest here,' he\nsaid. 'Yes, a fancy of mine,' replied Gabrielle, 'Eyraud knows nothing\nabout it.' 'Oh, you're tired of him,' asked Gouffe. 'Yes,' she replied,\n'that's all over.' Gabrielle drew Gouffe down on to the chair. She\nshowed him the cord of her dressing-gown and said that a wealthy admirer\nhad given it to her. 'Very elegant,' said Gouffe, 'but I didn't come\nhere to see that.'\n\n\"She then sat on his knee and, as if in play, slipped the cord round his\nneck; then putting her hand behind him, she fixed the end of the cord\ninto the swivel, and said to him laughingly, 'What a nice necktie it\nmakes!' That was the signal. Eyraud pulled the cord vigorously and, in\ntwo minutes, Gouffe had ceased to live.\"\n\nEyraud took from the dead man his watch and ring, 150 francs and his\nkeys. With these he hurried to Gouffe's office and made a fevered search\nfor money. It was fruitless. In his trembling haste the murderer missed\na sum of 14,000 francs that was lying behind some papers, and returned,\nbaffled and despairing, to his mistress and the corpse. The crime had\nbeen a ghastly failure. Fortified by brandy and champagne, and with the\nhelp of the woman, Eyraud stripped the body, put it into the bag that\nhad been sewn by Gabrielle, and pushed the bag into the trunk. Leaving\nhis mistress to spend the night with their hateful luggage, Eyraud\nreturned home and, in his own words, \"worn out by the excitement of the\nday, slept heavily.\"\n\n\nThe next day Eyraud, after saying good-bye to his wife and daughter,\nleft with Gabrielle for Lyons. On the 28th they got rid at Millery of\nthe body of Gouffe and the trunk in which it had travelled; his boots\nand clothes they threw into the sea at Marseilles. There Eyraud borrowed\n500 francs from his brother. Gabrielle raised 2,000 francs in Paris,\nwhere they spent August 18 and 19, after which they left for England,\nand from England sailed for America. During their short stay in\nParis Eyraud had the audacity to call at the apartment in the Rue\nTronson-Ducoudray for his hat, which he had left behind; in the hurry of\nthe crime he had taken away Gouffe's by mistake.\n\n\nEyraud had been brought back to Paris from Cuba at the end of June,\n1890. Soon after his return, in the room in which Gouffe had been done\nto death and in the presence of the examining magistrate, M. Goron, and\nsome fifteen other persons, Eyraud was confronted with his accomplice.\nEach denied vehemently, with hatred and passion, the other's story.\nNeither denied the murder, but each tried to represent the other as the\nmore guilty of the two. Eyraud said that the suggestion and plan of the\ncrime had come from Gabrielle; that she had placed around Gouffe's neck\nthe cord that throttled him. Gabrielle attributed the inception of the\nmurder to Eyraud, and said that he had strangled the bailiff with his\nown hands.\n\nEyraud, since his return, had seemed indifferent to his own fate;\nwhatever it might be, he wished that his mistress should share it. He\nhad no objection to going to the guillotine as long as he was sure that\nGabrielle would accompany him. She sought to escape such a consummation\nby representing herself as a mere instrument in Eyraud's hands. It was\neven urged in her defence that, in committing the crime, she had\nacted under the influence of hypnotic suggestion on the part of her\naccomplice. Three doctors appointed by the examining magistrate to\nreport on her mental state came unanimously to the conclusion that,\nthough undoubtedly susceptible to hypnotic suggestion, there was no\nground for thinking that she had been acting under such influence when\nshe participated in the murder of Gouffe. Intellectually the medical\ngentlemen found her alert and sane enough, but morally blind.\n\nThe trial of Eyraud and Bompard took place before the Paris Assize Court\non December 16, 1890. It had been delayed owing to the proceedings of an\nenterprising journalist. The names of the jurymen who were to be called\non to serve at the assize had been published. The journalist conceived\nthe brilliant idea of interviewing some of these gentlemen.\n\nHe succeeded in seeing four of them, but in his article which appeared\nin the Matin newspaper said that he had seen twenty-one. Nine of them,\nhe stated, had declared themselves in favour of Gabrielle Bompard, but\nin some of these he had discerned a certain \"eroticism of the pupil of\nthe eye\" to which he attributed their leniency. A month's imprisonment\nwas the reward of these flights of journalistic imagination.\n\nA further scandal in connection with the trial was caused by the lavish\ndistribution of tickets of admission to all sorts and kinds of persons\nby the presiding judge, M. Robert, whose occasional levities in the\ncourse of the proceedings are melancholy reading. As a result of\nhis indulgence a circular was issued shortly after the trial by M.\nFallieres, then Minister of Justice, limiting the powers of presidents\nof assize in admitting visitors into the reserved part of the court.\n\nThe proceedings at the trial added little to the known facts of the\ncase. Both Eyraud and Bompard continued to endeavour to shift the blame\non to each other's shoulders. A curious feature of the trial was the\nappearance for the defence of a M. Liegeois, a professor of law at\nNancy. To the dismay of the Court, he took advantage of a clause in\nthe Code of Criminal Instruction which permits a witness to give his\nevidence without interruption, to deliver an address lasting four hours\non hypnotic suggestion. He undertook to prove that, not only Gabrielle\nBompard, but Troppmann, Madame Weiss, and Gabrielle Fenayrou also, had\ncommitted murder under the influence of suggestion.(18) In replying\nto this rather fantastic defence, the Procureur-General, M. Quesnay de\nBeaurepaire, quoted a statement of Dr. Brouardel, the eminent medical\njurist who had been called for the prosecution, that \"there exists no\ninstance of a crime, or attempted crime committed under the influence of\nhypnotic suggestion.\" As to the influence of Eyraud over Bompard, M. de\nBeaurepaire said: \"The one outstanding fact that has been eternally true\nfor six thousand years is that the stronger will can possess the weaker:\nthat is no peculiar part of the history of hypnotism; it belongs to the\nhistory of the world. Dr. Liegeois himself, in coming to this court\nto-day, has fallen a victim to the suggestion of the young advocate who\nhas persuaded him to come here to air his theories.\" The Court wisely\ndeclined to allow an attempt to be made to hypnotise the woman Bompard\nin the presence of her judges, and M. Henri Robert, her advocate, in his\nappeal to the jury, threw over altogether any idea of hypnotic\nsuggestion, resting his plea on the moral weakness and irresponsibility\nof his client.\n\n\n     (18) Moll in his \"Hypnotism\" (London, 1909) states that, after Gabrielle\nBompard's release M. Liegeois succeeded in putting her into a hypnotic\nstate, in which she reacted the scene in which the crime was originally\nsuggested to her. The value of such experiments with a woman as\nmischievous and untruthful as Gabrielle Bompard must be very doubtful.\nNo trustworthy instance seems to be recorded in which a crime has\nbeen committed under, or brought about by, hypnotic or post-hypnotic\nsuggestion, though, according to Moll, \"the possibility of such a crime\ncannot be unconditionally denied.\"\n\n\nIn sheer wickedness there seems little enough to choose between Eyraud\nand Bompard. But, in asking a verdict without extenuating circumstances\nagainst the woman, the Procureur-General was by no means insistent. He\ncould not, he said, ask for less, his duty would not permit it: \"But I\nam ready to confess that my feelings as a man suffer by the duty imposed\non me as a magistrate. On one occasion, at the outset of my career, it\nfell to my lot to ask from a jury the head of a woman. I felt then\nthe same kind of distress of mind I feel to-day. The jury rejected my\ndemand; they accorded extenuating circumstances; though defeated, I left\nthe court a happier man. What are you going to do to-day, gentlemen? It\nrests with you. What I cannot ask of you, you have the right to accord.\nBut when the supreme moment comes to return your verdict, remember\nthat you have sworn to judge firmly and fearlessly.\" The jury accorded\nextenuating circumstances to the woman, but refused them to the man.\nAfter a trial lasting four days Eyraud was sentenced to death, Bompard\nto twenty years penal servitude.\n\nAt first Eyraud appeared to accept his fate with resignation. He wrote\nto his daughter that he was tired of life, and that his death was the\nbest thing that could happen for her mother and herself. But, as time\nwent on and the efforts of his advocate to obtain a commutation of his\nsentence held out some hope of reprieve, Eyraud became more reluctant to\nquit the world.\n\n\"There are grounds for a successful appeal,\" he wrote, \"I am pretty\ncertain that my sentence will be commuted.... You ask me what I do?\nNothing much. I can't write; the pens are so bad. I read part of the\ntime, smoke pipes, and sleep a great deal. Sometimes I play cards, and\ntalk a little. I have a room as large as yours at Sevres. I walk up and\ndown it, thinking of you all.\"\n\nBut his hopes were to be disappointed. The Court of Cassation rejected\nhis appeal. A petition was addressed to President Carnot, but, with a\nfirmness that has not characterised some of his successors in office, he\nrefused to commute the sentence.\n\nOn the morning of February 3, 1891, Eyraud noticed that the warders, who\nusually went off duty at six o'clock, remained at their posts. An hour\nlater the Governor of the Roquette prison entered his cell, and informed\nhim that the time had come for the execution of the sentence. Eyraud\nreceived the intelligence quietly. The only excitement he betrayed was a\nsudden outburst of violent animosity against M. Constans, then Minister\nof the Interior. Eyraud had been a Boulangist, and so may have nourished\nsome resentment against the Minister who, by his adroitness, had helped\nto bring about the General's ruin. Whatever his precise motive, he\nsuddenly exclaimed that M. Constans was his murderer: \"It's he who is\nhaving me guillotined; he's got what he wanted; I suppose now he'll\ndecorate Gabrielle!\" He died with the name of the hated Minister on his\nlips."
