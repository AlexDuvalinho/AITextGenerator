ADULFO SANCHEZ, OF MONTEREY)\n\n\nAt last, after so many years, I have the pleasure of re-introducing you\nto ‘Prince Otto,’ whom you will remember a very little fellow, no bigger\nin fact than a few sheets of memoranda written for me by your kind hand.\nThe sight of his name will carry you back to an old wooden house\nembowered in creepers; a house that was far gone in the respectable\nstages of antiquity and seemed indissoluble from the green garden in\nwhich it stood, and that yet was a sea-traveller in its younger days, and\nhad come round the Horn piecemeal in the belly of a ship, and might have\nheard the seamen stamping and shouting and the note of the boatswain’s\nwhistle.  It will recall to you the nondescript inhabitants now so widely\nscattered:—the two horses, the dog, and the four cats, some of them still\nlooking in your face as you read these lines;—the poor lady, so\nunfortunately married to an author;—the China boy, by this time, perhaps,\nbaiting his line by the banks of a river in the Flowery Land;—and in\nparticular the Scot who was then sick apparently unto death, and whom you\ndid so much to cheer and keep in good behaviour.\n\nYou may remember that he was full of ambitions and designs: so soon as he\nhad his health again completely, you may remember the fortune he was to\nearn, the journeys he was to go upon, the delights he was to enjoy and\nconfer, and (among other matters) the masterpiece he was to make of\n‘Prince Otto’!\n\nWell, we will not give in that we are finally beaten.  We read together\nin those days the story of Braddock, and how, as he was carried dying\nfrom the scene of his defeat, he promised himself to do better another\ntime: a story that will always touch a brave heart, and a dying speech\nworthy of a more fortunate commander.  I try to be of Braddock’s mind.  I\nstill mean to get my health again; I still purpose, by hook or crook,\nthis book or the next, to launch a masterpiece; and I still\nintend—somehow, some time or other—to see your face and to hold your\nhand.\n\nMeanwhile, this little paper traveller goes forth instead, crosses the\ngreat seas and the long plains and the dark mountains, and comes at last\nto your door in Monterey, charged with tender greetings.  Pray you, take\nhim in.  He comes from a house where (even as in your own) there are\ngathered together some of the waifs of our company at Oakland: a\nhouse—for all its outlandish Gaelic name and distant station—where you\nare well-beloved.\n\n                                                                  R. L. S.\n\n_Skerryvore_,\n      Bournemouth.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK I—PRINCE ERRANT\n\n\nCHAPTER I—IN WHICH THE PRINCE DEPARTS ON AN ADVENTURE\n\n\nYou shall seek in vain upon the map of Europe for the bygone state of\nGrünewald.  An independent principality, an infinitesimal member of the\nGerman Empire, she played, for several centuries, her part in the discord\nof Europe; and, at last, in the ripeness of time and at the spiriting of\nseveral bald diplomatists, vanished like a morning ghost.  Less fortunate\nthan Poland, she left not a regret behind her; and the very memory of her\nboundaries has faded.\n\nIt was a patch of hilly country covered with thick wood.  Many streams\ntook their beginning in the glens of Grünewald, turning mills for the\ninhabitants.  There was one town, Mittwalden, and many brown, wooden\nhamlets, climbing roof above roof, along the steep bottom of dells, and\ncommunicating by covered bridges over the larger of the torrents.  The\nhum of watermills, the splash of running water, the clean odour of pine\nsawdust, the sound and smell of the pleasant wind among the innumerable\narmy of the mountain pines, the dropping fire of huntsmen, the dull\nstroke of the wood-axe, intolerable roads, fresh trout for supper in the\nclean bare chamber of an inn, and the song of birds and the music of the\nvillage-bells—these were the recollections of the Grünewald tourist.\n\nNorth and east the foothills of Grünewald sank with varying profile into\na vast plain.  On these sides many small states bordered with the\nprincipality, Gerolstein, an extinct grand duchy, among the number.  On\nthe south it marched with the comparatively powerful kingdom of Seaboard\nBohemia, celebrated for its flowers and mountain bears, and inhabited by\na people of singular simplicity and tenderness of heart.  Several\nintermarriages had, in the course of centuries, united the crowned\nfamilies of Grünewald and Maritime Bohemia; and the last Prince of\nGrünewald, whose history I purpose to relate, drew his descent through\nPerdita, the only daughter of King Florizel the First of Bohemia.  That\nthese intermarriages had in some degree mitigated the rough, manly stock\nof the first Grünewalds, was an opinion widely held within the borders of\nthe principality.  The charcoal burner, the mountain sawyer, the wielder\nof the broad axe among the congregated pines of Grünewald, proud of their\nhard hands, proud of their shrewd ignorance and almost savage lore,\nlooked with an unfeigned contempt on the soft character and manners of\nthe sovereign race.\n\nThe precise year of grace in which this tale begins shall be left to the\nconjecture of the reader.  But for the season of the year (which, in such\na story, is the more important of the two) it was already so far forward\nin the spring, that when mountain people heard horns echoing all day\nabout the north-west corner of the principality, they told themselves\nthat Prince Otto and his hunt were up and out for the last time till the\nreturn of autumn.\n\nAt this point the borders of Grünewald descend somewhat steeply, here and\nthere breaking into crags; and this shaggy and trackless country stands\nin a bold contrast to the cultivated plain below.  It was traversed at\nthat period by two roads alone; one, the imperial highway, bound to\nBrandenau in Gerolstein, descended the slope obliquely and by the easiest\ngradients.  The other ran like a fillet across the very forehead of the\nhills, dipping into savage gorges, and wetted by the spray of tiny\nwaterfalls.  Once it passed beside a certain tower or castle, built sheer\nupon the margin of a formidable cliff, and commanding a vast prospect of\nthe skirts of Grünewald and the busy plains of Gerolstein.  The\nFelsenburg (so this tower was called) served now as a prison, now as a\nhunting-seat; and for all it stood so lonesome to the naked eye, with the\naid of a good glass the burghers of Brandenau could count its windows\nfrom the lime-tree terrace where they walked at night.\n\nIn the wedge of forest hillside enclosed between the roads, the horns\ncontinued all day long to scatter tumult; and at length, as the sun began\nto draw near to the horizon of the plain, a rousing triumph announced the\nslaughter of the quarry.  The first and second huntsman had drawn\nsomewhat aside, and from the summit of a knoll gazed down before them on\nthe drooping shoulders of the hill and across the expanse of plain.  They\ncovered their eyes, for the sun was in their faces.  The glory of its\ngoing down was somewhat pale.  Through the confused tracery of many\nthousands of naked poplars, the smoke of so many houses, and the evening\nsteam ascending from the fields, the sails of a windmill on a gentle\neminence moved very conspicuously, like a donkey’s ears.  And hard by,\nlike an open gash, the imperial high-road ran straight sun-ward, an\nartery of travel.\n\nThere is one of nature’s spiritual ditties, that has not yet been set to\nwords or human music: ‘The Invitation to the Road’; an air continually\nsounding in the ears of gipsies, and to whose inspiration our nomadic\nfathers journeyed all their days.  The hour, the season, and the scene,\nall were in delicate accordance.  The air was full of birds of passage,\nsteering westward and northward over Grünewald, an army of specks to the\nup-looking eye.  And below, the great practicable road was bound for the\nsame quarter.\n\nBut to the two horsemen on the knoll this spiritual ditty was unheard.\nThey were, indeed, in some concern of mind, scanning every fold of the\nsubjacent forest, and betraying both anger and dismay in their impatient\ngestures.\n\n‘I do not see him, Kuno,’ said the first huntsman, ‘nowhere—not a trace,\nnot a hair of the mare’s tail!  No, sir, he’s off; broke cover and got\naway.  Why, for twopence I would hunt him with the dogs!’\n\n‘Mayhap, he’s gone home,’ said Kuno, but without conviction.\n\n‘Home!’ sneered the other.  ‘I give him twelve days to get home.  No,\nit’s begun again; it’s as it was three years ago, before he married; a\ndisgrace!  Hereditary prince, hereditary fool!  There goes the government\nover the borders on a grey mare.  What’s that?  No, nothing—no, I tell\nyou, on my word, I set more store by a good gelding or an English dog.\nThat for your Otto!’\n\n‘He’s not my Otto,’ growled Kuno.\n\n‘Then I don’t know whose he is,’ was the retort.\n\n‘You would put your hand in the fire for him to-morrow,’ said Kuno,\nfacing round.\n\n‘Me!’ cried the huntsman.  ‘I would see him hanged!  I’m a Grünewald\npatriot—enrolled, and have my medal, too; and I would help a prince!  I’m\nfor liberty and Gondremark.’\n\n‘Well, it’s all one,’ said Kuno.  ‘If anybody said what you said, you\nwould have his blood, and you know it.’\n\n‘You have him on the brain,’ retorted his companion.  ‘There he goes!’ he\ncried, the next moment.\n\nAnd sure enough, about a mile down the mountain, a rider on a white horse\nwas seen to flit rapidly across a heathy open and vanish among the trees\non the farther side.\n\n‘In ten minutes he’ll be over the border into Gerolstein,’ said Kuno.\n‘It’s past cure.’\n\n‘Well, if he founders that mare, I’ll never forgive him,’ added the\nother, gathering his reins.\n\nAnd as they turned down from the knoll to rejoin their comrades, the sun\ndipped and disappeared, and the woods fell instantly into the gravity and\ngreyness of the early night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—IN WHICH THE PRINCE PLAYS HAROUN-AL-RASCHID\n\n\nThe night fell upon the Prince while he was threading green tracks in the\nlower valleys of the wood; and though the stars came out overhead and\ndisplayed the interminable order of the pine-tree pyramids, regular and\ndark like cypresses, their light was of small service to a traveller in\nsuch lonely paths, and from thenceforth he rode at random.  The austere\nface of nature, the uncertain issue of his course, the open sky and the\nfree air, delighted him like wine; and the hoarse chafing of a river on\nhis left sounded in his ears agreeably.\n\nIt was past eight at night before his toil was rewarded and he issued at\nlast out of the forest on the firm white high-road.  It lay downhill\nbefore him, with a sweeping eastward trend, faintly bright between the\nthickets; and Otto paused and gazed upon it.  So it ran, league after\nleague, still joining others, to the farthest ends of Europe, there\nskirting the sea-surge, here gleaming in the lights of cities; and the\ninnumerable army of tramps and travellers moved upon it in all lands as\nby a common impulse, and were now in all places drawing near to the inn\ndoor and the night’s rest.  The pictures swarmed and vanished in his\nbrain; a surge of temptation, a beat of all his blood, went over him, to\nset spur to the mare and to go on into the unknown for ever.  And then it\npassed away; hunger and fatigue, and that habit of middling actions which\nwe call common sense, resumed their empire; and in that changed mood his\neye lighted upon two bright windows on his left hand, between the road\nand river.\n\nHe turned off by a by-road, and in a few minutes he was knocking with his\nwhip on the door of a large farmhouse, and a chorus of dogs from the\nfarmyard were making angry answer.  A very tall, old, white-headed man\ncame, shading a candle, at the summons.  He had been of great strength in\nhis time, and of a handsome countenance; but now he was fallen away, his\nteeth were quite gone, and his voice when he spoke was broken and\nfalsetto.\n\n‘You will pardon me,’ said Otto.  ‘I am a traveller and have entirely\nlost my way.’\n\n‘Sir,’ said the old man, in a very stately, shaky manner, ‘you are at the\nRiver Farm, and I am Killian Gottesheim, at your disposal.  We are here,\nsir, at about an equal distance from Mittwalden in Grünewald and\nBrandenau in Gerolstein: six leagues to either, and the road excellent;\nbut there is not a wine bush, not a carter’s alehouse, anywhere between.\nYou will have to accept my hospitality for the night; rough hospitality,\nto which I make you freely welcome; for, sir,’ he added with a bow, ‘it\nis God who sends the guest.’\n\n‘Amen.  And I most heartily thank you,’ replied Otto, bowing in his turn.\n\n‘Fritz,’ said the old man, turning towards the interior, ‘lead round this\ngentleman’s horse; and you, sir, condescend to enter.’\n\nOtto entered a chamber occupying the greater part of the ground-floor of\nthe building.  It had probably once been divided; for the farther end was\nraised by a long step above the nearer, and the blazing fire and the\nwhite supper-table seemed to stand upon a daïs.  All around were dark,\nbrass-mounted cabinets and cupboards; dark shelves carrying ancient\ncountry crockery; guns and antlers and broadside ballads on the wall; a\ntall old clock with roses on the dial; and down in one corner the\ncomfortable promise of a wine barrel.  It was homely, elegant, and\nquaint.\n\nA powerful youth hurried out to attend on the grey mare; and when Mr.\nKillian Gottesheim had presented him to his daughter Ottilia, Otto\nfollowed to the stable as became, not perhaps the Prince, but the good\nhorseman.  When he returned, a smoking omelette and some slices of\nhome-cured ham were waiting him; these were followed by a ragout and a\ncheese; and it was not until his guest had entirely satisfied his hunger,\nand the whole party drew about the fire over the wine jug, that Killian\nGottesheim’s elaborate courtesy permitted him to address a question to\nthe Prince.\n\n‘You have perhaps ridden far, sir?’ he inquired.\n\n‘I have, as you say, ridden far,’ replied Otto; ‘and, as you have seen, I\nwas prepared to do justice to your daughters cookery.’\n\n‘Possibly, sir, from the direction of Brandenau?’ continued Killian.\n\n‘Precisely: and I should have slept to-night, had I not wandered, in\nMittwalden,’ answered the Prince, weaving in a patch of truth, according\nto the habit of all liars.\n\n‘Business leads you to Mittwalden?’ was the next question.\n\n‘Mere curiosity,’ said Otto.  ‘I have never yet visited the principality\nof Grünewald.’\n\n‘A pleasant state, sir,’ piped the old man, nodding, ‘a very pleasant\nstate, and a fine race, both pines and people.  We reckon ourselves part\nGrünewalders here, lying so near the borders; and the river there is all\ngood Grünewald water, every drop of it.  Yes, sir, a fine state.  A man\nof Grünewald now will swing me an axe over his head that many a man of\nGerolstein could hardly lift; and the pines, why, deary me, there must be\nmore pines in that little state, sir, than people in this whole big\nworld.  ’Tis twenty years now since I crossed the marshes, for we grow\nhome-keepers in old age; but I mind it as if it was yesterday.  Up and\ndown, the road keeps right on from here to Mittwalden; and nothing all\nthe way but the good green pine-trees, big and little, and water-power!\nwater-power at every step, sir.  We once sold a bit of forest, up there\nbeside the high-road; and the sight of minted money that we got for it\nhas set me ciphering ever since what all the pines in Grünewald would\namount to.’\n\n‘I suppose you see nothing of the Prince?’ inquired Otto.\n\n‘No,’ said the young man, speaking for the first time, ‘nor want to.’\n\n‘Why so? is he so much disliked?’ asked Otto.\n\n‘Not what you might call disliked,’ replied the old gentleman, ‘but\ndespised, sir.’\n\n‘Indeed,’ said the Prince, somewhat faintly.\n\n‘Yes, sir, despised,’ nodded Killian, filling a long pipe, ‘and, to my\nway of thinking, justly despised.  Here is a man with great\nopportunities, and what does he do with them?  He hunts, and he dresses\nvery prettily—which is a thing to be ashamed of in a man—and he acts\nplays; and if he does aught else, the news of it has not come here.’\n\n‘Yet these are all innocent,’ said Otto.  ‘What would you have him\ndo—make war?’\n\n‘No, sir,’ replied the old man.  ‘But here it is; I have been fifty years\nupon this River Farm, and wrought in it, day in, day out; I have ploughed\nand sowed and reaped, and risen early, and waked late; and this is the\nupshot: that all these years it has supported me and my family; and been\nthe best friend that ever I had, set aside my wife; and now, when my time\ncomes, I leave it a better farm than when I found it.  So it is, if a man\nworks hearty in the order of nature, he gets bread and he receives\ncomfort, and whatever he touches breeds.  And it humbly appears to me, if\nthat Prince was to labour on his throne, as I have laboured and wrought\nin my farm, he would find both an increase and a blessing.’\n\n‘I believe with you, sir,’ Otto said; ‘and yet the parallel is inexact.\nFor the farmer’s life is natural and simple; but the prince’s is both\nartificial and complicated.  It is easy to do right in the one, and\nexceedingly difficult not to do wrong in the other.  If your crop is\nblighted, you can take off your bonnet and say, “God’s will be done”; but\nif the prince meets with a reverse, he may have to blame himself for the\nattempt.  And perhaps, if all the kings in Europe were to confine\nthemselves to innocent amusement, the subjects would be the better off.’\n\n‘Ay,’ said the young man Fritz, ‘you are in the right of it there.  That\nwas a true word spoken.  And I see you are like me, a good patriot and an\nenemy to princes.’\n\nOtto was somewhat abashed at this deduction, and he made haste to change\nhis ground.  ‘But,’ said he, ‘you surprise me by what you say of this\nPrince Otto.  I have heard him, I must own, more favourably painted.  I\nwas told he was, in his heart, a good fellow, and the enemy of no one but\nhimself.’\n\n‘And so he is, sir,’ said the girl, ‘a very handsome, pleasant prince;\nand we know some who would shed their blood for him.’\n\n‘O! Kuno!’ said Fritz.  ‘An ignoramus!’\n\n‘Ay, Kuno, to be sure,’ quavered the old farmer.  ‘Well, since this\ngentleman is a stranger to these parts, and curious about the Prince, I\ndo believe that story might divert him.  This Kuno, you must know, sir,\nis one of the hunt servants, and a most ignorant, intemperate man: a\nright Grünewalder, as we say in Gerolstein.  We know him well, in this\nhouse; for he has come as far as here after his stray dogs; and I make\nall welcome, sir, without account of state or nation.  And, indeed,\nbetween Gerolstein and Grünewald the peace has held so long that the\nroads stand open like my door; and a man will make no more of the\nfrontier than the very birds themselves.’\n\n‘Ay,’ said Otto, ‘it has been a long peace—a peace of centuries.’\n\n‘Centuries, as you say,’ returned Killian; ‘the more the pity that it\nshould not be for ever.  Well, sir, this Kuno was one day in fault, and\nOtto, who has a quick temper, up with his whip and thrashed him, they do\nsay, soundly.  Kuno took it as best he could, but at last he broke out,\nand dared the Prince to throw his whip away and wrestle like a man; for\nwe are all great at wrestling in these parts, and it’s so that we\ngenerally settle our disputes.  Well, sir, the Prince did so; and, being\na weakly creature, found the tables turned; for the man whom he had just\nbeen thrashing like a negro slave, lifted him with a back grip and threw\nhim heels overhead.’\n\n‘He broke his bridle-arm,’ cried Fritz—‘and some say his nose.  Serve him\nright, say I!  Man to man, which is the better at that?’\n\n‘And then?’ asked Otto.\n\n‘O, then Kuno carried him home; and they were the best of friends from\nthat day forth.  I don’t say it’s a discreditable story, you observe,’\ncontinued Mr. Gottesheim; ‘but it’s droll, and that’s the fact.  A man\nshould think before he strikes; for, as my nephew says, man to man was\nthe old valuation.’\n\n‘Now, if you were to ask me,’ said Otto, ‘I should perhaps surprise you.\nI think it was the Prince that conquered.’\n\n‘And, sir, you would be right,’ replied Killian seriously.  ‘In the eyes\nof God, I do not question but you would be right; but men, sir, look at\nthese things differently, and they laugh.’\n\n‘They made a song of it,’ observed Fritz.  ‘How does it go?  Ta-tum-ta-ra\n. . .’\n\n‘Well,’ interrupted Otto, who had no great anxiety to hear the song, ‘the\nPrince is young; he may yet mend.’\n\n‘Not so young, by your leave,’ cried Fritz.  ‘A man of forty.’\n\n‘Thirty-six,’ corrected Mr. Gottesheim.\n\n‘O,’ cried Ottilia, in obvious disillusion, ‘a man of middle age!  And\nthey said he was so handsome when he was young!’\n\n‘And bald, too,’ added Fritz.\n\nOtto passed his hand among his locks.  At that moment he was far from\nhappy, and even the tedious evenings at Mittwalden Palace began to smile\nupon him by comparison.\n\n‘O, six-and-thirty!’ he protested.  ‘A man is not yet old at\nsix-and-thirty.  I am that age myself.’\n\n‘I should have taken you for more, sir,’ piped the old farmer.  ‘But if\nthat be so, you are of an age with Master Ottekin, as people call him;\nand, I would wager a crown, have done more service in your time.  Though\nit seems young by comparison with men of a great age like me, yet it’s\nsome way through life for all that; and the mere fools and fiddlers are\nbeginning to grow weary and to look old.  Yes, sir, by six-and-thirty, if\na man be a follower of God’s laws, he should have made himself a home and\na good name to live by; he should have got a wife and a blessing on his\nmarriage; and his works, as the Word says, should begin to follow him.’\n\n‘Ah, well, the Prince is married,’ cried Fritz, with a coarse burst of\nlaughter.\n\n‘That seems to entertain you, sir,’ said Otto.\n\n‘Ay,’ said the young boor.  ‘Did you not know that?  I thought all Europe\nknew it!’  And he added a pantomime of a nature to explain his accusation\nto the dullest.\n\n‘Ah, sir,’ said Mr. Gottesheim, ‘it is very plain that you are not from\nhereabouts!  But the truth is, that the whole princely family and Court\nare rips and rascals, not one to mend another.  They live, sir, in\nidleness and—what most commonly follows it—corruption.  The Princess has\na lover—a Baron, as he calls himself, from East Prussia; and the Prince\nis so little of a man, sir, that he holds the candle.  Nor is that the\nworst of it, for this foreigner and his paramour are suffered to transact\nthe State affairs, while the Prince takes the salary and leaves all\nthings to go to wrack.  There will follow upon this some manifest\njudgment which, though I am old, I may survive to see.’\n\n‘Good man, you are in the wrong about Gondremark,’ said Fritz, showing a\ngreatly increased animation; ‘but for all the rest, you speak the God’s\ntruth like a good patriot.  As for the Prince, if he would take and\nstrangle his wife, I would forgive him yet.’\n\n‘Nay, Fritz,’ said the old man, ‘that would be to add iniquity to evil.\nFor you perceive, sir,’ he continued, once more addressing himself to the\nunfortunate Prince, ‘this Otto has himself to thank for these disorders.\nHe has his young wife and his principality, and he has sworn to cherish\nboth.’\n\n‘Sworn at the altar!’ echoed Fritz.  ‘But put your faith in princes!’\n\n‘Well, sir, he leaves them both to an adventurer from East Prussia,’\npursued the farmer: ‘leaves the girl to be seduced and to go on from bad\nto worse, till her name’s become a tap-room by-word, and she not yet\ntwenty; leaves the country to be overtaxed, and bullied with armaments,\nand jockied into war—’\n\n‘War!’ cried Otto.\n\n‘So they say, sir; those that watch their ongoings, say to war,’\nasseverated Killian.  ‘Well, sir, that is very sad; it is a sad thing for\nthis poor, wicked girl to go down to hell with people’s curses; it’s a\nsad thing for a tight little happy country to be misconducted; but\nwhoever may complain, I humbly conceive, sir, that this Otto cannot.\nWhat he has worked for, that he has got; and may God have pity on his\nsoul, for a great and a silly sinner’s!’\n\n‘He has broke his oath; then he is a perjurer.  He takes the money and\nleaves the work; why, then plainly he’s a thief.  A cuckold he was\nbefore, and a fool by birth.  Better me that!’ cried Fritz, and snapped\nhis fingers.\n\n‘And now, sir, you will see a little,’ continued the farmer, ‘why we\nthink so poorly of this Prince Otto.  There’s such a thing as a man being\npious and honest in the private way; and there is such a thing, sir, as a\npublic virtue; but when a man has neither, the Lord lighten him!  Even\nthis Gondremark, that Fritz here thinks so much of—’\n\n‘Ay,’ interrupted Fritz, ‘Gondremark’s the man for me.  I would we had\nhis like in Gerolstein.’\n\n‘He is a bad man,’ said the old farmer, shaking his head; ‘and there was\nnever good begun by the breach of God’s commandments.  But so far I will\ngo with you; he is a man that works for what he has.’\n\n‘I tell you he’s the hope of Grünewald,’ cried Fritz.  ‘He doesn’t suit\nsome of your high-and-dry, old, ancient ideas; but he’s a downright\nmodern man—a man of the new lights and the progress of the age.  He does\nsome things wrong; so they all do; but he has the people’s interests next\nhis heart; and you mark me—you, sir, who are a Liberal, and the enemy of\nall their governments, you please to mark my words—the day will come in\nGrünewald, when they take out that yellow-headed skulk of a Prince and\nthat dough-faced Messalina of a Princess, march ’em back foremost over\nthe borders, and proclaim the Baron Gondremark first President.  I’ve\nheard them say it in a speech.  I was at a meeting once at Brandenau, and\nthe Mittwalden delegates spoke up for fifteen thousand.  Fifteen\nthousand, all brigaded, and each man with a medal round his neck to rally\nby.  That’s all Gondremark.’\n\n‘Ay, sir, you see what it leads to; wild talk to-day, and wilder doings\nto-morrow,’ said the old man.  ‘For there is one thing certain: that this\nGondremark has one foot in the Court backstairs, and the other in the\nMasons’ lodges.  He gives himself out, sir, for what nowadays they call a\npatriot: a man from East Prussia!’\n\n‘Give himself out!’ cried Fritz.  ‘He is!  He is to lay by his title as\nsoon as the Republic is declared; I heard it in a speech.’\n\n‘Lay by Baron to take up President?’ returned Killian.  ‘King Log, King\nStork.  But you’ll live longer than I, and you will see the fruits of\nit.’\n\n‘Father,’ whispered Ottilia, pulling at the speaker’s coat, ‘surely the\ngentleman is ill.’\n\n‘I beg your pardon,’ cried the farmer, rewaking to hospitable thoughts;\n‘can I offer you anything?’\n\n‘I thank you.  I am very weary,’ answered Otto.  ‘I have presumed upon my\nstrength.  If you would show me to a bed, I should be grateful.’\n\n‘Ottilia, a candle!’ said the old man.  ‘Indeed, sir, you look paley.  A\nlittle cordial water?  No?  Then follow me, I beseech you, and I will\nbring you to the stranger’s bed.  You are not the first by many who has\nslept well below my roof,’ continued the old gentleman, mounting the\nstairs before his guest; ‘for good food, honest wine, a grateful\nconscience, and a little pleasant chat before a man retires, are worth\nall the possets and apothecary’s drugs.  See, sir,’ and here he opened a\ndoor and ushered Otto into a little white-washed sleeping-room, ‘here you\nare in port.  It is small, but it is airy, and the sheets are clean and\nkept in lavender.  The window, too, looks out above the river, and\nthere’s no music like a little river’s.  It plays the same tune (and\nthat’s the favourite) over and over again, and yet does not weary of it\nlike men fiddlers.  It takes the mind out of doors: and though we should\nbe grateful for good houses, there is, after all, no house like God’s\nout-of-doors.  And lastly, sir, it quiets a man down like saying his\nprayers.  So here, sir, I take my kind leave of you until to-morrow; and\nit is my prayerful wish that you may slumber like a prince.’\n\nAnd the old man, with the twentieth courteous inclination, left his guest\nalone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—IN WHICH THE PRINCE COMFORTS AGE AND BEAUTY AND DELIVERS A\nLECTURE ON DISCRETION IN LOVE\n\n\nThe Prince was early abroad: in the time of the first chorus of birds, of\nthe pure and quiet air, of the slanting sunlight and the mile-long\nshadows.  To one who had passed a miserable night, the freshness of that\nhour was tonic and reviving; to steal a march upon his slumbering\nfellows, to be the Adam of the coming day, composed and fortified his\nspirits; and the Prince, breathing deep and pausing as he went, walked in\nthe wet fields beside his shadow, and was glad.\n\nA trellised path led down into the valley of the brook, and he turned to\nfollow it.  The stream was a break-neck, boiling Highland river.  Hard by\nthe farm, it leaped a little precipice in a thick grey-mare’s tail of\ntwisted filaments, and then lay and worked and bubbled in a lynn.  Into\nthe middle of this quaking pool a rock protruded, shelving to a cape; and\nthither Otto scrambled and sat down to ponder.\n\nSoon the sun struck through the screen of branches and thin early leaves\nthat made a hanging bower above the fall; and the golden lights and\nflitting shadows fell upon and marbled the surface of that so seething\npot; and rays plunged deep among the turning waters; and a spark, as\nbright as a diamond, lit upon the swaying eddy.  It began to grow warm\nwhere Otto lingered, warm and heady; the lights swam, weaving their maze\nacross the shaken pool; on the impending rock, reflections danced like\nbutterflies; and the air was fanned by the waterfall as by a swinging\ncurtain.\n\nOtto, who was weary with tossing and beset with horrid phantoms of\nremorse and jealousy, instantly fell dead in love with that\nsun-chequered, echoing corner.  Holding his feet, he stared out of a\ndrowsy trance, wondering, admiring, musing, losing his way among\nuncertain thoughts.  There is nothing that so apes the external bearing\nof free will as that unconscious bustle, obscurely following liquid laws,\nwith which a river contends among obstructions.  It seems the very play\nof man and destiny, and as Otto pored on these recurrent changes, he\ngrew, by equal steps, the sleepier and the more profound.  Eddy and\nPrince were alike jostled in their purpose, alike anchored by intangible\ninfluences in one corner of the world.  Eddy and Prince were alike\nuseless, starkly useless, in the cosmology of men.  Eddy and\nPrince—Prince and Eddy.\n\nIt is probable he had been some while asleep when a voice recalled him\nfrom oblivion.  ‘Sir,’ it was saying; and looking round, he saw Mr.\nKillian’s daughter, terrified by her boldness and making bashful signals\nfrom the shore.  She was a plain, honest lass, healthy and happy and\ngood, and with that sort of beauty that comes of happiness and health.\nBut her confusion lent her for the moment an additional charm.\n\n‘Good-morning,’ said Otto, rising and moving towards her.  ‘I arose early\nand was in a dream.’\n\n‘O, sir!’ she cried, ‘I wish to beg of you to spare my father; for I\nassure your Highness, if he had known who you was, he would have bitten\nhis tongue out sooner.  And Fritz, too—how he went on!  But I had a\nnotion; and this morning I went straight down into the stable, and there\nwas your Highness’s crown upon the stirrup-irons!  But, O, sir, I made\ncertain you would spare them; for they were as innocent as lambs.’\n\n‘My dear,’ said Otto, both amused and gratified, ‘you do not understand.\nIt is I who am in the wrong; for I had no business to conceal my name and\nlead on these gentleman to speak of me.  And it is I who have to beg of\nyou that you will keep my secret and not betray the discourtesy of which\nI was guilty.  As for any fear of me, your friends are safe in\nGerolstein; and even in my own territory, you must be well aware I have\nno power.’\n\n‘O, sir,’ she said, curtsying, ‘I would not say that: the huntsmen would\nall die for you.’\n\n‘Happy Prince!’ said Otto.  ‘But although you are too courteous to avow\nthe knowledge, you have had many opportunities of learning that I am a\nvain show.  Only last night we heard it very clearly stated.  You see the\nshadow flitting on this hard rock?  Prince Otto, I am afraid, is but the\nmoving shadow, and the name of the rock is Gondremark.  Ah! if your\nfriends had fallen foul of Gondremark!  But happily the younger of the\ntwo admires him.  And as for the old gentleman your father, he is a wise\nman and an excellent talker, and I would take a long wager he is honest.’\n\n‘O, for honest, your Highness, that he is!’ exclaimed the girl.  ‘And\nFritz is as honest as he.  And as for all they said, it was just talk and\nnonsense.  When countryfolk get gossiping, they go on, I do assure you,\nfor the fun; they don’t as much as think of what they say.  If you went\nto the next farm, it’s my belief you would hear as much against my\nfather.’\n\n‘Nay, nay,’ said Otto, ‘there you go too fast.  For all that was said\nagainst Prince Otto—’\n\n‘O, it was shameful!’ cried the girl.\n\n‘Not shameful—true,’ returned Otto.  ‘O, yes—true.  I am all they said of\nme—all that and worse.’\n\n‘I never!’ cried ‘Ottilia.  ‘Is that how you do?  Well, you would never\nbe a soldier.  Now if any one accuses me, I get up and give it them.  O,\nI defend myself.  I wouldn’t take a fault at another person’s hands, no,\nnot if I had it on my forehead.  And that’s what you must do, if you mean\nto live it out.  But, indeed, I never heard such nonsense.  I should\nthink you was ashamed of yourself!  You’re bald, then, I suppose?’\n\n‘O no,’ said Otto, fairly laughing.  ‘There I acquit myself: not bald!’\n\n‘Well, and good?’ pursued the girl.  ‘Come now, you know you are good,\nand I’ll make you say so . . . Your Highness, I beg your humble pardon.\nBut there’s no disrespect intended.  And anyhow, you know you are.’\n\n‘Why, now, what am I to say?’ replied Otto.  ‘You are a cook, and\nexcellently well you do it; I embrace the chance of thanking you for the\nragout.  Well now, have you not seen good food so bedevilled by unskilful\ncookery that no one could be brought to eat the pudding?  That is me, my\ndear.  I am full of good ingredients, but the dish is worthless.  I am—I\ngive it you in one word—sugar in the salad.’\n\n‘Well, I don’t care, you’re good,’ reiterated Ottilia, a little flushed\nby having failed to understand.\n\n‘I will tell you one thing,’ replied Otto: ‘You are!’\n\n‘Ah, well, that’s what they all said of you,’ moralised the girl; ‘such a\ntongue to come round—such a flattering tongue!’\n\n‘O, you forget, I am a man of middle age,’ the Prince chuckled.\n\n‘Well, to speak to you, I should think you was a boy; and Prince or no\nPrince, if you came worrying where I was cooking, I would pin a napkin to\nyour tails. . . . And, O Lord, I declare I hope your Highness will\nforgive me,’ the girl added.  ‘I can’t keep it in my mind.’\n\n‘No more can I,’ cried Otto.  ‘That is just what they complain of!’\n\nThey made a loverly-looking couple; only the heavy pouring of that\nhorse-tail of water made them raise their voices above lovers’ pitch.\nBut to a jealous onlooker from above, their mirth and close proximity\nmight easily give umbrage; and a rough voice out of a tuft of brambles\nbegan calling on Ottilia by name.  She changed colour at that.  ‘It is\nFritz,’ she said.  ‘I must go.’\n\n‘Go, my dear, and I need not bid you go in peace, for I think you have\ndiscovered that I am not formidable at close quarters,’ said the Prince,\nand made her a fine gesture of dismissal.\n\nSo Ottilia skipped up the bank, and disappeared into the thicket,\nstopping once for a single blushing bob—blushing, because she had in the\ninterval once more forgotten and remembered the stranger’s quality.\n\nOtto returned to his rock promontory; but his humour had in the meantime\nchanged.  The sun now shone more fairly on the pool; and over its brown,\nwelling surface, the blue of heaven and the golden green of the spring\nfoliage danced in fleeting arabesque.  The eddies laughed and brightened\nwith essential colour.  And the beauty of the dell began to rankle in the\nPrince’s mind; it was so near to his own borders, yet without.  He had\nnever had much of the joy of possessorship in any of the thousand and one\nbeautiful and curious things that were his; and now he was conscious of\nenvy for what was another’s.  It was, indeed, a smiling, dilettante sort\nof envy; but yet there it was: the passion of Ahab for the vineyard, done\nin little; and he was relieved when Mr. Killian appeared upon the scene.\n\n‘I hope, sir, that you have slept well under my plain roof,’ said the old\nfarmer.\n\n‘I am admiring this sweet spot that you are privileged to dwell in,’\nreplied Otto, evading the inquiry.\n\n‘It is rustic,’ returned Mr. Gottesheim, looking around him with\ncomplacency, ‘a very rustic corner; and some of the land to the west is\nmost excellent fat land, excellent deep soil.  You should see my wheat in\nthe ten-acre field.  There is not a farm in Grünewald, no, nor many in\nGerolstein, to match the River Farm.  Some sixty—I keep thinking when I\nsow—some sixty, and some seventy, and some an hundredfold; and my own\nplace, six score!  But that, sir, is partly the farming.’\n\n‘And the stream has fish?’ asked Otto.\n\n‘A fish-pond,’ said the farmer.  ‘Ay, it is a pleasant bit.  It is\npleasant even here, if one had time, with the brook drumming in that\nblack pool, and the green things hanging all about the rocks, and, dear\nheart, to see the very pebbles! all turned to gold and precious stones!\nBut you have come to that time of life, sir, when, if you will excuse me,\nyou must look to have the rheumatism set in.  Thirty to forty is, as one\nmay say, their seed-time.  And this is a damp cold corner for the early\nmorning and an empty stomach.  If I might humbly advise you, sir, I would\nbe moving.’\n\n‘With all my heart,’ said Otto gravely.  ‘And so you have lived your life\nhere?’ he added, as they turned to go.\n\n‘Here I was born,’ replied the farmer, ‘and here I wish I could say I was\nto die.  But fortune, sir, fortune turns the wheel.  They say she is\nblind, but we will hope she only sees a little farther on.  My\ngrandfather and my father and I, we have all tilled these acres, my\nfurrow following theirs.  All the three names are on the garden bench,\ntwo Killians and one Johann.  Yes, sir, good men have prepared themselves\nfor the great change in my old garden.  Well do I mind my father, in a\nwoollen night-cap, the good soul, going round and round to see the last\nof it.  ‘Killian,’ said he, ‘do you see the smoke of my tobacco?  Why,’\nsaid he, ‘that is man’s life.’  It was his last pipe, and I believe he\nknew it; and it was a strange thing, without doubt, to leave the trees\nthat he had planted, and the son that he had begotten, ay, sir, and even\nthe old pipe with the Turk’s head that he had smoked since he was a lad\nand went a-courting.  But here we have no continuing city; and as for the\neternal, it’s a comfortable thought that we have other merits than our\nown.  And yet you would hardly think how sore it goes against the grain\nwith me, to die in a strange bed.’\n\n‘And must you do so?  For what reason?’ Otto asked.\n\n‘The reason?  The place is to be sold; three thousand crowns,’ replied\nMr. Gottesheim.  ‘Had it been a third of that, I may say without boasting\nthat, what with my credit and my savings, I could have met the sum.  But\nat three thousand, unless I have singular good fortune and the new\nproprietor continues me in office, there is nothing left me but to\nbudge.’\n\nOtto’s fancy for the place redoubled at the news, and became joined with\nother feelings.  If all he heard were true, Grünewald was growing very\nhot for a sovereign Prince; it might be well to have a refuge; and if so,\nwhat more delightful hermitage could man imagine?  Mr. Gottesheim,\nbesides, had touched his sympathies.  Every man loves in his soul to play\nthe part of the stage deity.  And to step down to the aid of the old\nfarmer, who had so roughly handled him in talk, was the ideal of a Fair\nRevenge.  Otto’s thoughts brightened at the prospect, and he began to\nregard himself with a renewed respect.\n\n‘I can find you, I believe, a purchaser,’ he said, ‘and one who would\ncontinue to avail himself of your skill.’\n\n‘Can you, sir, indeed?’ said the old man.  ‘Well, I shall be heartily\nobliged; for I begin to find a man may practise resignation all his days,\nas he takes physic, and not come to like it in the end.’\n\n‘If you will have the papers drawn, you may even burthen the purchase\nwith your interest,’ said Otto.  ‘Let it be assured to you through life.’\n\n‘Your friend, sir,’ insinuated Killian, ‘would not, perhaps, care to make\nthe interest reversible?  Fritz is a good lad.’\n\n‘Fritz is young,’ said the Prince dryly; ‘he must earn consideration, not\ninherit.’\n\n‘He has long worked upon the place, sir,’ insisted Mr. Gottesheim; ‘and\nat my great age, for I am seventy-eight come harvest, it would be a\ntroublesome thought to the proprietor how to fill my shoes.  It would be\na care spared to assure yourself of Fritz.  And I believe he might be\ntempted by a permanency.’\n\n‘The young man has unsettled views,’ returned Otto.\n\n‘Possibly the purchaser—’ began Killian.\n\nA little spot of anger burned in Otto’s cheek.  ‘I am the purchaser,’ he\nsaid.\n\n‘It was what I might have guessed,’ replied the farmer, bowing with an\naged, obsequious dignity.  ‘You have made an old man very happy; and I\nmay say, indeed, that I have entertained an angel unawares.  Sir, the\ngreat people of this world—and by that I mean those who are great in\nstation—if they had only hearts like yours, how they would make the fires\nburn and the poor sing!’\n\n‘I would not judge them hardly, sir,’ said Otto.  ‘We all have our\nfrailties.’\n\n‘Truly, sir,’ said Mr. Gottesheim, with unction.  ‘And by what name, sir,\nam I to address my generous landlord?’\n\nThe double recollection of an English traveller, whom he had received the\nweek before at court, and of an old English rogue called Transome, whom\nhe had known in youth, came pertinently to the Prince’s help.\n‘Transome,’ he answered, ‘is my name.  I am an English traveller.  It is,\nto-day, Tuesday.  On Thursday, before noon, the money shall be ready.\nLet us meet, if you please, in Mittwalden, at the “Morning Star.”’\n\n‘I am, in all things lawful, your servant to command,’ replied the\nfarmer.  ‘An Englishman!  You are a great race of travellers.  And has\nyour lordship some experience of land?’\n\n‘I have had some interest of the kind before,’ returned the Prince; ‘not\nin Gerolstein, indeed.  But fortune, as you say, turns the wheel, and I\ndesire to be beforehand with her revolutions.’\n\n‘Very right, sir, I am sure,’ said Mr. Killian.\n\nThey had been strolling with deliberation; but they were now drawing near\nto the farmhouse, mounting by the trellised pathway to the level of the\nmeadow.  A little before them, the sound of voices had been some while\naudible, and now grew louder and more distinct with every step of their\nadvance.  Presently, when they emerged upon the top of the bank, they\nbeheld Fritz and Ottilia some way off; he, very black and bloodshot,\nemphasising his hoarse speech with the smacking of his fist against his\npalm; she, standing a little way off in blowsy, voluble distress.\n\n‘Dear me!’ said Mr. Gottesheim, and made as if he would turn aside.\n\nBut Otto went straight towards the lovers, in whose dissension he\nbelieved himself to have a share.  And, indeed, as soon as he had seen\nthe Prince, Fritz had stood tragic, as if awaiting and defying his\napproach.\n\n‘O, here you are!’ he cried, as soon as they were near enough for easy\nspeech.  ‘You are a man at least, and must reply.  What were you after?\nWhy were you two skulking in the bush?  God!’ he broke out, turning again\nupon Ottilia, ‘to think that I should waste my heart on you!’\n\n‘I beg your pardon,’ Otto cut in.  ‘You were addressing me.  In virtue of\nwhat circumstance am I to render you an account of this young lady’s\nconduct?  Are you her father? her brother? her husband?’\n\n‘O, sir, you know as well as I,’ returned the peasant.  ‘We keep company,\nshe and I.  I love her, and she is by way of loving me; but all shall be\nabove-board, I would have her to know.  I have a good pride of my own.’\n\n‘Why, I perceive I must explain to you what love is,’ said Otto.  ‘Its\nmeasure is kindness.  It is very possible that you are proud; but she,\ntoo, may have some self-esteem; I do not speak for myself.  And perhaps,\nif your own doings were so curiously examined, you might find it\ninconvenient to reply.’\n\n‘These are all set-offs,’ said the young man.  ‘You know very well that a\nman is a man, and a woman only a woman.  That holds good all over, up and\ndown.  I ask you a question, I ask it again, and here I stand.’  He drew\na mark and toed it.\n\n‘When you have studied liberal doctrines somewhat deeper,’ said the\nPrince, ‘you will perhaps change your note.  You are a man of false\nweights and measures, my young friend.  You have one scale for women,\nanother for men; one for princes, and one for farmer-folk.  On the prince\nwho neglects his wife you can be most severe.  But what of the lover who\ninsults his mistress?  You use the name of love.  I should think this\nlady might very fairly ask to be delivered from love of such a nature.\nFor if I, a stranger, had been one-tenth part so gross and so\ndiscourteous, you would most righteously have broke my head.  It would\nhave been in your part, as lover, to protect her from such insolence.\nProtect her first, then, from yourself.’\n\n‘Ay,’ quoth Mr. Gottesheim, who had been looking on with his hands behind\nhis tall old back, ‘ay, that’s Scripture truth.’\n\nFritz was staggered, not only by the Prince’s imperturbable superiority\nof manner, but by a glimmering consciousness that he himself was in the\nwrong.  The appeal to liberal doctrines had, besides, unmanned him.\n\n‘Well,’ said he, ‘if I was rude, I’ll own to it.  I meant no ill, and did\nnothing out of my just rights; but I am above all these old vulgar\nnotions too; and if I spoke sharp, I’ll ask her pardon.’\n\n‘Freely granted, Fritz,’ said Ottilia.\n\n‘But all this doesn’t answer me,’ cried Fritz.  ‘I ask what you two spoke\nabout.  She says she promised not to tell; well, then, I mean to know.\nCivility is civility, but I’ll be no man’s gull.  I have a right to\ncommon justice, if I _do_ keep company!’\n\n‘If you will ask Mr. Gottesheim,’ replied Otto, ‘you will find I have not\nspent my hours in idleness.  I have, since I arose this morning, agreed\nto buy the farm.  So far I will go to satisfy a curiosity which I\ncondemn.’\n\n‘O, well, if there was business, that’s another matter,’ returned Fritz.\n‘Though it beats me why you could not tell.  But, of course, if the\ngentleman is to buy the farm, I suppose there would naturally be an end.’\n\n‘To be sure,’ said Mr. Gottesheim, with a strong accent of conviction.\n\nBut Ottilia was much braver.  ‘There now!’ she cried in triumph.  ‘What\ndid I tell you?  I told you I was fighting your battles.  Now you see!\nThink shame of your suspicious temper!  You should go down upon your\nbended knees both to that gentleman and me.’\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—IN WHICH THE PRINCE COLLECTS OPINIONS BY THE WAY\n\n\nA little before noon Otto, by a triumph of manoeuvring, effected his\nescape.  He was quit in this way of the ponderous gratitude of Mr.\nKillian, and of the confidential gratitude of poor Ottilia; but of Fritz\nhe was not quit so readily.  That young politician, brimming with\nmysterious glances, offered to lend his convoy as far as to the\nhigh-road; and Otto, in fear of some residuary jealousy and for the\ngirl’s sake, had not the courage to gainsay him; but he regarded his\ncompanion with uneasy glances, and devoutly wished the business at an\nend.  For some time Fritz walked by the mare in silence; and they had\nalready traversed more than half the proposed distance when, with\nsomething of a blush, he looked up and opened fire.\n\n‘Are you not,’ he asked, ‘what they call a socialist?’\n\n‘Why, no,’ returned Otto, ‘not precisely what they call so.  Why do you\nask?’\n\n‘I will tell you why,’ said the young man.  ‘I saw from the first that\nyou were a red progressional, and nothing but the fear of old Killian\nkept you back.  And there, sir, you were right: old men are always\ncowards.  But nowadays, you see, there are so many groups: you can never\ntell how far the likeliest kind of man may be prepared to go; and I was\nnever sure you were one of the strong thinkers, till you hinted about\nwomen and free love.’\n\n‘Indeed,’ cried Otto, ‘I never said a word of such a thing.’\n\n‘Not you!’ cried Fritz.  ‘Never a word to compromise!  You was sowing\nseed: ground-bait, our president calls it.  But it’s hard to deceive me,\nfor I know all the agitators and their ways, and all the doctrines; and\nbetween you and me,’ lowering his voice, ‘I am myself affiliated.  O yes,\nI am a secret society man, and here is my medal.’  And drawing out a\ngreen ribbon that he wore about his neck, he held up, for Otto’s\ninspection, a pewter medal bearing the imprint of a Phoenix and the\nlegend _Libertas_.  ‘And so now you see you may trust me,’ added Fritz,\n‘I am none of your alehouse talkers; I am a convinced revolutionary.’\nAnd he looked meltingly upon Otto.\n\n‘I see,’ replied the Prince; ‘that is very gratifying.  Well, sir, the\ngreat thing for the good of one’s country is, first of all, to be a good\nman.  All springs from there.  For my part, although you are right in\nthinking that I have to do with politics, I am unfit by intellect and\ntemper for a leading rôle.  I was intended, I fear, for a subaltern.  Yet\nwe have all something to command, Mr. Fritz, if it be only our own\ntemper; and a man about to marry must look closely to himself.  The\nhusband’s, like the prince’s, is a very artificial standing; and it is\nhard to be kind in either.  Do you follow that?’\n\n‘O yes, I follow that,’ replied the young man, sadly chop-fallen over the\nnature of the information he had elicited; and then brightening up: ‘Is\nit,’ he ventured, ‘is it for an arsenal that you have bought the farm?’\n\n‘We’ll see about that,’ the Prince answered, laughing.  ‘You must not be\ntoo zealous.  And in the meantime, if I were you, I would say nothing on\nthe subject.’\n\n‘O, trust me, sir, for that,’ cried Fritz, as he pocketed a crown.  ‘And\nyou’ve let nothing out; for I suspected—I might say I knew it—from the\nfirst.  And mind you, when a guide is required,’ he added, ‘I know all\nthe forest paths.’\n\nOtto rode away, chuckling.  This talk with Fritz had vastly entertained\nhim; nor was he altogether discontented with his bearing at the farm;\nmen, he was able to tell himself, had behaved worse under smaller\nprovocation.  And, to harmonise all, the road and the April air were both\ndelightful to his soul.\n\nUp and down, and to and fro, ever mounting through the wooded foothills,\nthe broad white high-road wound onward into Grünewald.  On either hand\nthe pines stood coolly rooted—green moss prospering, springs welling\nforth between their knuckled spurs; and though some were broad and\nstalwart, and others spiry and slender, yet all stood firm in the same\nattitude and with the same expression, like a silent army presenting\narms.\n\nThe road lay all the way apart from towns and villages, which it left on\neither hand.  Here and there, indeed, in the bottom of green glens, the\nPrince could spy a few congregated roofs, or perhaps above him, on a\nshoulder, the solitary cabin of a woodman.  But the highway was an\ninternational undertaking and with its face set for distant cities,\nscorned the little life of Grünewald.  Hence it was exceeding solitary.\nNear the frontier Otto met a detachment of his own troops marching in the\nhot dust; and he was recognised and somewhat feebly cheered as he rode\nby.  But from that time forth and for a long while he was alone with the\ngreat woods.\n\nGradually the spell of pleasure relaxed; his own thoughts returned, like\nstinging insects, in a cloud; and the talk of the night before, like a\nshower of buffets, fell upon his memory.  He looked east and west for any\ncomforter; and presently he was aware of a cross-road coming steeply down\nhill, and a horseman cautiously descending.  A human voice or presence,\nlike a spring in the desert, was now welcome in itself, and Otto drew\nbridle to await the coming of this stranger.  He proved to be a very\nred-faced, thick-lipped countryman, with a pair of fat saddle-bags and a\nstone bottle at his waist; who, as soon as the Prince hailed him,\njovially, if somewhat thickly, answered.  At the same time he gave a\nbeery yaw in the saddle.  It was clear his bottle was no longer full.\n\n‘Do you ride towards Mittwalden?’ asked the Prince.\n\n‘As far as the cross-road to Tannenbrunn,’ the man replied.  ‘Will you\nbear company?’\n\n‘With pleasure.  I have even waited for you on the chance,’ answered\nOtto.\n\nBy this time they were close alongside; and the man, with the countryfolk\ninstinct, turned his cloudy vision first of all on his companion’s mount.\n‘The devil!’ he cried.  ‘You ride a bonny mare, friend!’  And then, his\ncuriosity being satisfied about the essential, he turned his attention to\nthat merely secondary matter, his companion’s face.  He started.  ‘The\nPrince!’ he cried, saluting, with another yaw that came near dismounting\nhim.  ‘I beg your pardon, your Highness, not to have recognised you at\nonce.’\n\nThe Prince was vexed out of his self-possession.  ‘Since you know me,’ he\nsaid, ‘it is unnecessary we should ride together.  I will precede you, if\nyou please.’  And he was about to set spur to the grey mare, when the\nhalf-drunken fellow, reaching over, laid his hand upon the rein.\n\n‘Hark you,’ he said, ‘prince or no prince, that is not how one man should\nconduct himself with another.  What!  You’ll ride with me incog. and set\nme talking!  But if I know you, you’ll preshede me, if you please!  Spy!’\nAnd the fellow, crimson with drink and injured vanity, almost spat the\nword into the Prince’s face.\n\nA horrid confusion came over Otto.  He perceived that he had acted\nrudely, grossly presuming on his station.  And perhaps a little shiver of\nphysical alarm mingled with his remorse, for the fellow was very powerful\nand not more than half in the possession of his senses.  ‘Take your hand\nfrom my rein,’ he said, with a sufficient assumption of command; and when\nthe man, rather to his wonder, had obeyed: ‘You should understand, sir,’\nhe added, ‘that while I might be glad to ride with you as one person of\nsagacity with another, and so receive your true opinions, it would amuse\nme very little to hear the empty compliments you would address to me as\nPrince.’\n\n‘You think I would lie, do you?’ cried the man with the bottle, purpling\ndeeper.\n\n‘I know you would,’ returned Otto, entering entirely into his\nself-possession.  ‘You would not even show me the medal you wear about\nyour neck.’  For he had caught a glimpse of a green ribbon at the\nfellow’s throat.\n\nThe change was instantaneous: the red face became mottled with yellow: a\nthick-fingered, tottering hand made a clutch at the tell-tale ribbon.\n‘Medal!’ the man cried, wonderfully sobered.  ‘I have no medal.’\n\n‘Pardon me,’ said the Prince.  ‘I will even tell you what that medal\nbears: a Phoenix burning, with the word _Libertas_.’  The medallist\nremaining speechless, ‘You are a pretty fellow,’ continued Otto, smiling,\n‘to complain of incivility from the man whom you conspire to murder.’\n\n‘Murder!’ protested the man.  ‘Nay, never that; nothing criminal for me!’\n\n‘You are strangely misinformed,’ said Otto.  ‘Conspiracy itself is\ncriminal, and ensures the pain of death.  Nay, sir, death it is; I will\nguarantee my accuracy.  Not that you need be so deplorably affected, for\nI am no officer.  But those who mingle with politics should look at both\nsides of the medal.’\n\n‘Your Highness . . . ’ began the knight of the bottle.\n\n‘Nonsense! you are a Republican,’ cried Otto; ‘what have you to do with\nhighnesses?  But let us continue to ride forward.  Since you so much\ndesire it, I cannot find it in my heart to deprive you of my company.\nAnd for that matter, I have a question to address to you.  Why, being so\ngreat a body of men—for you are a great body—fifteen thousand, I have\nheard, but that will be understated; am I right?’\n\nThe man gurgled in his throat.\n\n‘Why, then, being so considerable a party,’ resumed Otto, ‘do you not\ncome before me boldly with your wants?—what do I say? with your commands?\nHave I the name of being passionately devoted to my throne?  I can scarce\nsuppose it.  Come, then; show me your majority, and I will instantly\nresign.  Tell this to your friends; assure them from me of my docility;\nassure them that, however they conceive of my deficiencies, they cannot\nsuppose me more unfit to be a ruler than I do myself.  I am one of the\nworst princes in Europe; will they improve on that?’\n\n‘Far be it from me . . .’ the man began.\n\n‘See, now, if you will not defend my government!’ cried Otto.  ‘If I were\nyou, I would leave conspiracies.  You are as little fit to be a\nconspirator as I to be a king.’\n\n‘One thing I will say out,’ said the man.  ‘It is not so much you that we\ncomplain of, it’s your lady.’\n\n‘Not a word, sir’ said the Prince; and then after a moment’s pause, and\nin tones of some anger and contempt: ‘I once more advise you to have done\nwith politics,’ he added; ‘and when next I see you, let me see you sober.\nA morning drunkard is the last man to sit in judgment even upon the worst\nof princes.’\n\n‘I have had a drop, but I had not been drinking,’ the man replied,\ntriumphing in a sound distinction.  ‘And if I had, what then?  Nobody\nhangs by me.  But my mill is standing idle, and I blame it on your wife.\nAm I alone in that?  Go round and ask.  Where are the mills?  Where are\nthe young men that should be working?  Where is the currency?  All\nparalysed.  No, sir, it is not equal; for I suffer for your faults—I pay\nfor them, by George, out of a poor man’s pocket.  And what have you to do\nwith mine?  Drunk or sober, I can see my country going to hell, and I can\nsee whose fault it is.  And so now, I’ve said my say, and you may drag me\nto a stinking dungeon; what care I?  I’ve spoke the truth, and so I’ll\nhold hard, and not intrude upon your Highness’s society.’\n\nAnd the miller reined up and, clumsily enough, saluted.\n\n‘You will observe, I have not asked your name,’ said Otto.  ‘I wish you a\ngood ride,’ and he rode on hard.  But let him ride as he pleased, this\ninterview with the miller was a chokepear, which he could not swallow.\nHe had begun by receiving a reproof in manners, and ended by sustaining a\ndefeat in logic, both from a man whom he despised.  All his old thoughts\nreturned with fresher venom.  And by three in the afternoon, coming to\nthe cross-roads for Beckstein, Otto decided to turn aside and dine there\nleisurely.  Nothing at least could be worse than to go on as he was\ngoing.\n\nIn the inn at Beckstein he remarked, immediately upon his entrance, an\nintelligent young gentleman dining, with a book in front of him.  He had\nhis own place laid close to the reader, and with a proper apology, broke\nground by asking what he read.\n\n‘I am perusing,’ answered the young gentleman, ‘the last work of the Herr\nDoctor Hohenstockwitz, cousin and librarian of your Prince here in\nGrünewald—a man of great erudition and some lambencies of wit.’\n\n‘I am acquainted,’ said Otto, ‘with the Herr Doctor, though not yet with\nhis work.’\n\n‘Two privileges that I must envy you,’ replied the young man politely:\n‘an honour in hand, a pleasure in the bush.’\n\n‘The Herr Doctor is a man much respected, I believe, for his\nattainments?’ asked the Prince.\n\n‘He is, sir, a remarkable instance of the force of intellect,’ replied\nthe reader.  ‘Who of our young men know anything of his cousin, all\nreigning Prince although he be?  Who but has heard of Doctor Gotthold?\nBut intellectual merit, alone of all distinctions, has its base in\nnature.’\n\n‘I have the gratification of addressing a student—perhaps an author?’\nOtto suggested.\n\nThe young man somewhat flushed.  ‘I have some claim to both distinctions,\nsir, as you suppose,’ said he; ‘there is my card.  I am the licentiate\nRoederer, author of several works on the theory and practice of\npolitics.’\n\n‘You immensely interest me,’ said the Prince; ‘the more so as I gather\nthat here in Grünewald we are on the brink of revolution.  Pray, since\nthese have been your special studies, would you augur hopefully of such a\nmovement?’\n\n‘I perceive,’ said the young author, with a certain vinegary twitch,\n‘that you are unacquainted with my opuscula.  I am a convinced\nauthoritarian.  I share none of those illusory, Utopian fancies with\nwhich empirics blind themselves and exasperate the ignorant.  The day of\nthese ideas is, believe me, past, or at least passing.’\n\n‘When I look about me—’ began Otto.\n\n‘When you look about you,’ interrupted the licentiate, ‘you behold the\nignorant.  But in the laboratory of opinion, beside the studious lamp, we\nbegin already to discard these figments.  We begin to return to nature’s\norder, to what I might call, if I were to borrow from the language of\ntherapeutics, the expectant treatment of abuses.  You will not\nmisunderstand me,’ he continued: ‘a country in the condition in which we\nfind Grünewald, a prince such as your Prince Otto, we must explicitly\ncondemn; they are behind the age.  But I would look for a remedy not to\nbrute convulsions, but to the natural supervenience of a more able\nsovereign.  I should amuse you, perhaps,’ added the licentiate, with a\nsmile, ‘I think I should amuse you if I were to explain my notion of a\nprince.  We who have studied in the closet, no longer, in this age,\npropose ourselves for active service.  The paths, we have perceived, are\nincompatible.  I would not have a student on the throne, though I would\nhave one near by for an adviser.  I would set forward as prince a man of\na good, medium understanding, lively rather than deep; a man of courtly\nmanner, possessed of the double art to ingratiate and to command;\nreceptive, accommodating, seductive.  I have been observing you since\nyour first entrance.  Well, sir, were I a subject of Grünewald I should\npray heaven to set upon the seat of government just such another as\nyourself.’\n\n‘The devil you would!’ exclaimed the Prince.\n\nThe licentiate Roederer laughed most heartily.  ‘I thought I should\nastonish you,’ he said.  ‘These are not the ideas of the masses.’\n\n‘They are not, I can assure you,’ Otto said.\n\n‘Or rather,’ distinguished the licentiate, ‘not to-day.  The time will\ncome, however, when these ideas shall prevail.’\n\n‘You will permit me, sir, to doubt it,’ said Otto.\n\n‘Modesty is always admirable,’ chuckled the theorist.  ‘But yet I assure\nyou, a man like you, with such a man as, say, Doctor Gotthold at your\nelbow, would be, for all practical issues, my ideal ruler.’\n\nAt this rate the hours sped pleasantly for Otto.  But the licentiate\nunfortunately slept that night at Beckstein, where he was, being dainty\nin the saddle and given to half stages.  And to find a convoy to\nMittwalden, and thus mitigate the company of his own thoughts, the Prince\nhad to make favour with a certain party of wood-merchants from various\nstates of the empire, who had been drinking together somewhat noisily at\nthe far end of the apartment.\n\nThe night had already fallen when they took the saddle.  The merchants\nwere very loud and mirthful; each had a face like a nor’west moon; and\nthey played pranks with each others’ horses, and mingled songs and\nchoruses, and alternately remembered and forgot the companion of their\nride.  Otto thus combined society and solitude, hearkening now to their\nchattering and empty talk, now to the voices of the encircling forest.\nThe starlit dark, the faint wood airs, the clank of the horse-shoes\nmaking broken music, accorded together and attuned his mind.  And he was\nstill in a most equal temper when the party reached the top of that long\nhill that overlooks Mittwalden.\n\nDown in the bottom of a bowl of forest, the lights of the little formal\ntown glittered in a pattern, street crossing street; away by itself on\nthe right, the palace was glowing like a factory.\n\nAlthough he knew not Otto, one of the wood-merchants was a native of the\nstate.  ‘There,’ said he, pointing to the palace with his whip, ‘there is\nJezebel’s inn.’\n\n‘What, do you call it that?’ cried another, laughing.\n\n‘Ay, that’s what they call it,’ returned the Grünewalder; and he broke\ninto a song, which the rest, as people well acquainted with the words and\nair, instantly took up in chorus.  Her Serene Highness Amalia Seraphina,\nPrincess of Grünewald, was the heroine, Gondremark the hero of this\nballad.  Shame hissed in Otto’s ears.  He reined up short and sat stunned\nin the saddle; and the singers continued to descend the hill without him.\n\nThe song went to a rough, swashing, popular air; and long after the words\nbecame inaudible the swing of the music, rising and falling, echoed\ninsult in the Prince’s brain.  He fled the sounds.  Hard by him on his\nright a road struck towards the palace, and he followed it through the\nthick shadows and branching alleys of the park.  It was a busy place on a\nfine summer’s afternoon, when the court and burghers met and saluted; but\nat that hour of the night in the early spring it was deserted to the\nroosting birds.  Hares rustled among the covert; here and there a statue\nstood glimmering, with its eternal gesture; here and there the echo of an\nimitation temple clattered ghostly to the trampling of the mare.  Ten\nminutes brought him to the upper end of his own home garden, where the\nsmall stables opened, over a bridge, upon the park.  The yard clock was\nstriking the hour of ten; so was the big bell in the palace bell-tower;\nand, farther off, the belfries of the town.  About the stable all else\nwas silent but the stamping of stalled horses and the rattle of halters.\nOtto dismounted; and as he did so a memory came back to him: a whisper of\ndishonest grooms and stolen corn, once heard, long forgotten, and now\nrecurring in the nick of opportunity.  He crossed the bridge, and, going\nup to a window, knocked six or seven heavy blows in a particular cadence,\nand, as he did so, smiled.  Presently a wicket was opened in the gate,\nand a man’s head appeared in the dim starlight.\n\n‘Nothing to-night,’ said a voice.\n\n‘Bring a lantern,’ said the Prince.\n\n‘Dear heart a’ mercy!’ cried the groom.  ‘Who’s that?’\n\n‘It is I, the Prince,’ replied Otto.  ‘Bring a lantern, take in the mare,\nand let me through into the garden.’\n\nThe man remained silent for a while, his head still projecting through\nthe wicket.\n\n‘His Highness!’ he said at last.  ‘And why did your Highness knock so\nstrange?’\n\n‘It is a superstition in Mittwalden,’ answered Otto, ‘that it cheapens\ncorn.’\n\nWith a sound like a sob the groom fled.  He was very white when he\nreturned, even by the light of the lantern; and his hand trembled as he\nundid the fastenings and took the mare.\n\n‘Your Highness,’ he began at last, ‘for God’s sake . . . ’  And there he\npaused, oppressed with guilt.\n\n‘For God’s sake, what?’ asked Otto cheerfully.  ‘For God’s sake let us\nhave cheaper corn, say I.  Good-night!’  And he strode off into the\ngarden, leaving the groom petrified once more.\n\nThe garden descended by a succession of stone terraces to the level of\nthe fish-pond.  On the far side the ground rose again, and was crowned by\nthe confused roofs and gables of the palace.  The modern pillared front,\nthe ball-room, the great library, the princely apartments, the busy and\nilluminated quarters of that great house, all faced the town.  The garden\nside was much older; and here it was almost dark; only a few windows\nquietly lighted at various elevations.  The great square tower rose,\nthinning by stages like a telescope; and on the top of all the flag hung\nmotionless.\n\nThe garden, as it now lay in the dusk and glimmer of the starshine,\nbreathed of April violets.  Under night’s cavern arch the shrubs\nobscurely bustled.  Through the plotted terraces and down the marble\nstairs the Prince rapidly descended, fleeing before uncomfortable\nthoughts.  But, alas! from these there is no city of refuge.  And now,\nwhen he was about midway of the descent, distant strains of music began\nto fall upon his ear from the ball-room, where the court was dancing.\nThey reached him faint and broken, but they touched the keys of memory;\nand through and above them Otto heard the ranting melody of the\nwood-merchants’ song.  Mere blackness seized upon his mind.  Here he was,\ncoming home; the wife was dancing, the husband had been playing a trick\nupon a lackey; and meanwhile, all about them, they were a by-word to\ntheir subjects.  Such a prince, such a husband, such a man, as this Otto\nhad become!  And he sped the faster onward.\n\nSome way below he came unexpectedly upon a sentry; yet a little farther,\nand he was challenged by a second; and as he crossed the bridge over the\nfish-pond, an officer making the rounds stopped him once more.  The\nparade of watch was more than usual; but curiosity was dead in Otto’s\nmind, and he only chafed at the interruption.  The porter of the back\npostern admitted him, and started to behold him so disordered.  Thence,\nhasting by private stairs and passages, he came at length unseen to his\nown chamber, tore off his clothes, and threw himself upon his bed in the\ndark.  The music of the ball-room still continued to a very lively\nmeasure; and still, behind that, he heard in spirit the chorus of the\nmerchants clanking down the hill.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II—OF LOVE AND POLITICS\n\n\nCHAPTER I—WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LIBRARY\n\n\nAt a quarter before six on the following morning Doctor Gotthold was\nalready at his desk in the library; and with a small cup of black coffee\nat his elbow, and an eye occasionally wandering to the busts and the long\narray of many-coloured books, was quietly reviewing the labours of the\nday before.  He was a man of about forty, flaxen-haired, with refined\nfeatures a little worn, and bright eyes somewhat faded.  Early to bed and\nearly to rise, his life was devoted to two things: erudition and Rhine\nwine.  An ancient friendship existed latent between him and Otto; they\nrarely met, but when they did it was to take up at once the thread of\ntheir suspended intimacy.  Gotthold, the virgin priest of knowledge, had\nenvied his cousin, for half a day, when he was married; he had never\nenvied him his throne.\n\nReading was not a popular diversion at the court of Grünewald; and that\ngreat, pleasant, sunshiny gallery of books and statues was, in practice,\nGotthold’s private cabinet.  On this particular Wednesday morning,\nhowever, he had not been long about his manuscript when a door opened and\nthe Prince stepped into the apartment.  The doctor watched him as he drew\nnear, receiving, from each of the embayed windows in succession, a flush\nof morning sun; and Otto looked so gay, and walked so airily, he was so\nwell dressed and brushed and frizzled, so point-device, and of such a\nsovereign elegance, that the heart of his cousin the recluse was rather\nmoved against him.\n\n‘Good-morning, Gotthold,’ said Otto, dropping in a chair.\n\n‘Good-morning, Otto,’ returned the librarian.  ‘You are an early bird.\nIs this an accident, or do you begin reforming?’\n\n‘It is about time, I fancy,’ answered the Prince.\n\n‘I cannot imagine,’ said the Doctor.  ‘I am too sceptical to be an\nethical adviser; and as for good resolutions, I believed in them when I\nwas young.  They are the colours of hope’s rainbow.’\n\n‘If you come to think of it,’ said Otto, ‘I am not a popular sovereign.’\nAnd with a look he changed his statement to a question.\n\n‘Popular?  Well, there I would distinguish,’ answered Gotthold, leaning\nback and joining the tips of his fingers.  ‘There are various kinds of\npopularity; the bookish, which is perfectly impersonal, as unreal as the\nnightmare; the politician’s, a mixed variety; and yours, which is the\nmost personal of all.  Women take to you; footmen adore you; it is as\nnatural to like you as to pat a dog; and were you a saw-miller you would\nbe the most popular citizen in Grünewald.  As a prince—well, you are in\nthe wrong trade.  It is perhaps philosophical to recognise it as you do.’\n\n‘Perhaps philosophical?’ repeated Otto.\n\n‘Yes, perhaps.  I would not be dogmatic,’ answered Gotthold.\n\n‘Perhaps philosophical, and certainly not virtuous,’ Otto resumed.\n\n‘Not of a Roman virtue,’ chuckled the recluse.\n\nOtto drew his chair nearer to the table, leaned upon it with his elbow,\nand looked his cousin squarely in the face.  ‘In short,’ he asked, ‘not\nmanly?’\n\n‘Well,’ Gotthold hesitated, ‘not manly, if you will.’  And then, with a\nlaugh, ‘I did not know that you gave yourself out to be manly,’ he added.\n‘It was one of the points that I inclined to like about you; inclined, I\nbelieve, to admire.  The names of virtues exercise a charm on most of us;\nwe must lay claim to all of them, however incompatible; we must all be\nboth daring and prudent; we must all vaunt our pride and go to the stake\nfor our humility.  Not so you.  Without compromise you were yourself: a\npretty sight.  I have always said it: none so void of all pretence as\nOtto.’\n\n‘Pretence and effort both!’ cried Otto.  ‘A dead dog in a canal is more\nalive.  And the question, Gotthold, the question that I have to face is\nthis: Can I not, with effort and self-denial, can I not become a\ntolerable sovereign?’\n\n‘Never,’ replied Gotthold.  ‘Dismiss the notion.  And besides, dear\nchild, you would not try.’\n\n‘Nay, Gotthold, I am not to be put by,’ said Otto.  ‘If I am\nconstitutionally unfit to be a sovereign, what am I doing with this\nmoney, with this palace, with these guards?  And I—a thief—am to execute\nthe law on others?’\n\n‘I admit the difficulty,’ said Gotthold.\n\n‘Well, can I not try?’ continued Otto.  ‘Am I not bound to try?  And with\nthe advice and help of such a man as you—’\n\n‘Me!’ cried the librarian.  ‘Now, God forbid!’\n\nOtto, though he was in no very smiling humour, could not forbear to\nsmile.  ‘Yet I was told last night,’ he laughed, ‘that with a man like me\nto impersonate, and a man like you to touch the springs, a very possible\ngovernment could be composed.’\n\n‘Now I wonder in what diseased imagination,’ Gotthold said, ‘that\npreposterous monster saw the light of day?’\n\n‘It was one of your own trade—a writer: one Roederer,’ said Otto.\n\n‘Roederer! an ignorant puppy!’ cried the librarian.\n\n‘You are ungrateful,’ said Otto.  ‘He is one of your professed admirers.’\n\n‘Is he?’ cried Gotthold, obviously impressed.  ‘Come, that is a good\naccount of the young man.  I must read his stuff again.  It is the rather\nto his credit, as our views are opposite.  The east and west are not more\nopposite.  Can I have converted him?  But no; the incident belongs to\nFairyland.’\n\n‘You are not then,’ asked the Prince, ‘an authoritarian?’\n\n‘I?  God bless me, no!’ said Gotthold.  ‘I am a red, dear child.’\n\n‘That brings me then to my next point, and by a natural transition.  If I\nam so clearly unfitted for my post,’ the Prince asked; ‘if my friends\nadmit it, if my subjects clamour for my downfall, if revolution is\npreparing at this hour, must I not go forth to meet the inevitable?\nshould I not save these horrors and be done with these absurdities? in a\nword, should I not abdicate?  O, believe me, I feel the ridicule, the\nvast abuse of language,’ he added, wincing, ‘but even a principulus like\nme cannot resign; he must make a great gesture, and come buskined forth,\nand abdicate.’\n\n‘Ay,’ said Gotthold, ‘or else stay where he is.  What gnat has bitten you\nto-day?  Do you not know that you are touching, with lay hands, the very\nholiest inwards of philosophy, where madness dwells?  Ay, Otto, madness;\nfor in the serene temples of the wise, the inmost shrine, which we\ncarefully keep locked, is full of spiders’ webs.  All men, all, are\nfundamentally useless; nature tolerates, she does not need, she does not\nuse them: sterile flowers!  All—down to the fellow swinking in a byre,\nwhom fools point out for the exception—all are useless; all weave ropes\nof sand; or like a child that has breathed on a window, write and\nobliterate, write and obliterate, idle words!  Talk of it no more.  That\nway, I tell you, madness lies.’  The speaker rose from his chair and then\nsat down again.  He laughed a little laugh, and then, changing his tone,\nresumed: ‘Yes, dear child, we are not here to do battle with giants; we\nare here to be happy like the flowers, if we can be.  It is because you\ncould, that I have always secretly admired you.  Cling to that trade;\nbelieve me, it is the right one.  Be happy, be idle, be airy.  To the\ndevil with all casuistry! and leave the state to Gondremark, as\nheretofore.  He does it well enough, they say; and his vanity enjoys the\nsituation.’\n\n‘Gotthold,’ cried Otto, ‘what is this to me?  Useless is not the\nquestion; I cannot rest at uselessness; I must be useful or I must be\nnoxious—one or other.  I grant you the whole thing, prince and\nprincipality alike, is pure absurdity, a stroke of satire; and that a\nbanker or the man who keeps an inn has graver duties.  But now, when I\nhave washed my hands of it three years, and left all—labour,\nresponsibility, and honour and enjoyment too, if there be any—to\nGondremark and to—Seraphina—’  He hesitated at the name, and Gotthold\nglanced aside.  ‘Well,’ the Prince continued, ‘what has come of it?\nTaxes, army, cannon—why, it’s like a box of lead soldiers!  And the\npeople sick at the folly of it, and fired with the injustice!  And war,\ntoo—I hear of war—war in this teapot!  What a complication of absurdity\nand disgrace!  And when the inevitable end arrives—the revolution—who\nwill be to blame in the sight of God, who will be gibbeted in public\nopinion?  I!  Prince Puppet!’\n\n‘I thought you had despised public opinion,’ said Gotthold.\n\n‘I did,’ said Otto sombrely, ‘but now I do not.  I am growing old.  And\nthen, Gotthold, there is Seraphina.  She is loathed in this country that\nI brought her to and suffered her to spoil.  Yes, I gave it her as a\nplaything, and she has broken it: a fine Prince, an admirable Princess!\nEven her life—I ask you, Gotthold, is her life safe?’\n\n‘It is safe enough to-day,’ replied the librarian: ‘but since you ask me\nseriously, I would not answer for to-morrow.  She is ill-advised.’\n\n‘And by whom?  By this Gondremark, to whom you counsel me to leave my\ncountry,’ cried the Prince.  ‘Rare advice!  The course that I have been\nfollowing all these years, to come at last to this.  O, ill-advised! if\nthat were all!  See now, there is no sense in beating about the bush\nbetween two men: you know what scandal says of her?’\n\nGotthold, with pursed lips, silently nodded.\n\n‘Well, come, you are not very cheering as to my conduct as the Prince;\nhave I even done my duty as a husband?’ Otto asked.\n\n‘Nay, nay,’ said Gotthold, earnestly and eagerly, ‘this is another\nchapter.  I am an old celibate, an old monk.  I cannot advise you in your\nmarriage.’\n\n‘Nor do I require advice,’ said Otto, rising.  ‘All of this must cease.’\nAnd he began to walk to and fro with his hands behind his back.\n\n‘Well, Otto, may God guide you!’ said Gotthold, after a considerable\nsilence.  ‘I cannot.’\n\n‘From what does all this spring?’ said the Prince, stopping in his walk.\n‘What am I to call it?  Diffidence?  The fear of ridicule?  Inverted\nvanity?  What matter names, if it has brought me to this?  I could never\nbear to be bustling about nothing; I was ashamed of this toy kingdom from\nthe first; I could not tolerate that people should fancy I believed in a\nthing so patently absurd!  I would do nothing that cannot be done\nsmiling.  I have a sense of humour, forsooth!  I must know better than my\nMaker.  And it was the same thing in my marriage,’ he added more\nhoarsely.  ‘I did not believe this girl could care for me; I must not\nintrude; I must preserve the foppery of my indifference.  What an\nimpotent picture!’\n\n‘Ay, we have the same blood,’ moralised Gotthold.  ‘You are drawing, with\nfine strokes, the character of the born sceptic.’\n\n‘Sceptic?—coward!’ cried Otto.  ‘Coward is the word.  A springless,\nputty-hearted, cowering coward!’\n\nAnd as the Prince rapped out the words in tones of unusual vigour, a\nlittle, stout, old gentleman, opening a door behind Gotthold, received\nthem fairly in the face.  With his parrot’s beak for a nose, his pursed\nmouth, his little goggling eyes, he was the picture of formality; and in\nordinary circumstances, strutting behind the drum of his corporation, he\nimpressed the beholder with a certain air of frozen dignity and wisdom.\nBut at the smallest contrariety, his trembling hands and disconnected\ngestures betrayed the weakness at the root.  And now, when he was thus\nsurprisingly received in that library of Mittwalden Palace, which was the\ncustomary haunt of silence, his hands went up into the air as if he had\nbeen shot, and he cried aloud with the scream of an old woman.\n\n‘O!’ he gasped, recovering, ‘Your Highness!  I beg ten thousand pardons.\nBut your Highness at such an hour in the library!—a circumstance so\nunusual as your Highness’s presence was a thing I could not be expected\nto foresee.’\n\n‘There is no harm done, Herr Cancellarius,’ said Otto.\n\n‘I came upon the errand of a moment: some papers I left over-night with\nthe Herr Doctor,’ said the Chancellor of Grünewald.  ‘Herr Doctor, if you\nwill kindly give me them, I will intrude no longer.’\n\nGotthold unlocked a drawer and handed a bundle of manuscript to the old\ngentleman, who prepared, with fitting salutations, to take his departure.\n\n‘Herr Greisengesang, since we have met,’ said Otto, ‘let us talk.’\n\n‘I am honoured by his Highness’s commands,’ replied the Chancellor.\n\n‘All has been quiet since I left?’ asked the Prince, resuming his seat.\n\n‘The usual business, your Highness,’ answered Greisengesang; ‘punctual\ntrifles: huge, indeed, if neglected, but trifles when discharged.  Your\nHighness is most zealously obeyed.’\n\n‘Obeyed, Herr Cancellarius?’ returned the Prince.  ‘And when have I\nobliged you with an order?  Replaced, let us rather say.  But to touch\nupon these trifles; instance me a few.’\n\n‘The routine of government, from which your Highness has so wisely\ndissociated his leisure . . . ’ began Greisengesang.\n\n‘We will leave my leisure, sir,’ said Otto.  ‘Approach the facts.’\n\n‘The routine of business was proceeded with,’ replied the official, now\nvisibly twittering.\n\n‘It is very strange, Herr Cancellarius, that you should so persistently\navoid my questions,’ said the Prince.  ‘You tempt me to suppose a purpose\nin your dulness.  I have asked you whether all was quiet; do me the\npleasure to reply.’\n\n‘Perfectly—O, perfectly quiet,’ jerked the ancient puppet, with every\nsignal of untruth.\n\n‘I make a note of these words,’ said the Prince gravely.  ‘You assure me,\nyour sovereign, that since the date of my departure nothing has occurred\nof which you owe me an account.’\n\n‘I take your Highness, I take the Herr Doctor to witness,’ cried\nGreisengesang, ‘that I have had no such expression.’\n\n‘Halt!’ said the Prince; and then, after a pause: ‘Herr Greisengesang,\nyou are an old man, and you served my father before you served me,’ he\nadded.  ‘It consists neither with your dignity nor mine that you should\nbabble excuses and stumble possibly upon untruths.  Collect your\nthoughts; and then categorically inform me of all you have been charged\nto hide.’\n\nGotthold, stooping very low over his desk, appeared to have resumed his\nlabours; but his shoulders heaved with subterranean merriment.  The\nPrince waited, drawing his handkerchief quietly through his fingers.\n\n‘Your Highness, in this informal manner,’ said the old gentleman at last,\n‘and being unavoidably deprived of documents, it would be difficult, it\nwould be impossible, to do justice to the somewhat grave occurrences\nwhich have transpired.’\n\n‘I will not criticise your attitude,’ replied the Prince.  ‘I desire\nthat, between you and me, all should be done gently; for I have not\nforgotten, my old friend, that you were kind to me from the first, and\nfor a period of years a faithful servant.  I will thus dismiss the\nmatters on which you waive immediate inquiry.  But you have certain\npapers actually in your hand.  Come, Herr Greisengesang, there is at\nleast one point for which you have authority.  Enlighten me on that.’\n\n‘On that?’ cried the old gentleman.  ‘O, that is a trifle; a matter, your\nHighness, of police; a detail of a purely administrative order.  These\nare simply a selection of the papers seized upon the English traveller.’\n\n‘Seized?’ echoed Otto.  ‘In what sense?  Explain yourself.’\n\n‘Sir John Crabtree,’ interposed Gotthold, looking up, ‘was arrested\nyesterday evening.’\n\n‘It this so, Herr Cancellarius?’ demanded Otto sternly.\n\n‘It was judged right, your Highness,’ protested Greisengesang.  ‘The\ndecree was in due form, invested with your Highness’s authority by\nprocuration.  I am but an agent; I had no status to prevent the measure.’\n\n‘This man, my guest, has been arrested,’ said the Prince.  ‘On what\ngrounds, sir?  With what colour of pretence?’\n\nThe Chancellor stammered.\n\n‘Your Highness will perhaps find the reason in these documents,’ said\nGotthold, pointing with the tail of his pen.\n\nOtto thanked his cousin with a look.  ‘Give them to me,’ he said,\naddressing the Chancellor.\n\nBut that gentleman visibly hesitated to obey.  ‘Baron von Gondremark,’ he\nsaid, ‘has made the affair his own.  I am in this case a mere messenger;\nand as such, I am not clothed with any capacity to communicate the\ndocuments I carry.  Herr Doctor, I am convinced you will not fail to bear\nme out.’\n\n‘I have heard a great deal of nonsense,’ said Gotthold, ‘and most of it\nfrom you; but this beats all.’\n\n‘Come, sir,’ said Otto, rising, ‘the papers.  I command.’\n\nHerr Greisengesang instantly gave way.\n\n‘With your Highness’s permission,’ he said, ‘and laying at his feet my\nmost submiss apologies, I will now hasten to attend his further orders in\nthe Chancery.’\n\n‘Herr Cancellarius, do you see this chair?’ said Otto.  ‘There is where\nyou shall attend my further orders.  O, now, no more!’ he cried, with a\ngesture, as the old man opened his lips.  ‘You have sufficiently marked\nyour zeal to your employer; and I begin to weary of a moderation you\nabuse.’\n\nThe Chancellor moved to the appointed chair and took his seat in silence.\n\n‘And now,’ said Otto, opening the roll, ‘what is all this? it looks like\nthe manuscript of a book.’\n\n‘It is,’ said Gotthold, ‘the manuscript of a book of travels.’\n\n‘You have read it, Doctor Hohenstockwitz?’ asked the Prince.\n\n‘Nay, I but saw the title-page,’ replied Gotthold.  ‘But the roll was\ngiven to me open, and I heard no word of any secrecy.’\n\nOtto dealt the Chancellor an angry glance.\n\n‘I see,’ he went on.  ‘The papers of an author seized at this date of the\nworld’s history, in a state so petty and so ignorant as Grünewald, here\nis indeed an ignominious folly.  Sir,’ to the Chancellor, ‘I marvel to\nfind you in so scurvy an employment.  On your conduct to your Prince I\nwill not dwell; but to descend to be a spy!  For what else can it be\ncalled?  To seize the papers of this gentleman, the private papers of a\nstranger, the toil of a life, perhaps—to open, and to read them.  And\nwhat have we to do with books?  The Herr Doctor might perhaps be asked\nfor his advice; but we have no _index expurgatorius_ in Grünewald.  Had\nwe but that, we should be the most absolute parody and farce upon this\ntawdry earth.’\n\nYet, even while Otto spoke, he had continued to unfold the roll; and now,\nwhen it lay fully open, his eye rested on the title-page elaborately\nwritten in red ink.  It ran thus:\n\n                                   MEMOIRS\n                          OF A VISIT TO THE VARIOUS\n                              COURTS OF EUROPE,\n                                      BY\n                         SIR JOHN CRABTREE, BARONET.\n\nBelow was a list of chapters, each bearing the name of one of the\nEuropean Courts; and among these the nineteenth and the last upon the\nlist was dedicated to Grünewald.\n\n‘Ah!  The Court of Grünewald!’ said Otto, ‘that should be droll reading.’\nAnd his curiosity itched for it.\n\n‘A methodical dog, this English Baronet,’ said Gotthold.  ‘Each chapter\nwritten and finished on the spot.  I shall look for his work when it\nappears.’\n\n‘It would be odd, now, just to glance at it,’ said Otto, wavering.\n\nGotthold’s brow darkened, and he looked out of window.\n\nBut though the Prince understood the reproof, his weakness prevailed.  ‘I\nwill,’ he said, with an uneasy laugh, ‘I will, I think, just glance at\nit.’\n\nSo saying, he resumed his seat and spread the traveller’s manuscript upon\nthe table.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—‘ON THE COURT OF GRÜNEWALD,’ BEING A PORTION OF THE\nTRAVELLER’S MANUSCRIPT\n\n\nIt may well be asked (_it was thus the English traveller began his\nnineteenth chapter_) why I should have chosen Grünewald out of so many\nother states equally petty, formal, dull, and corrupt.  Accident, indeed,\ndecided, and not I; but I have seen no reason to regret my visit.  The\nspectacle of this small society macerating in its own abuses was not\nperhaps instructive, but I have found it exceedingly diverting.\n\nThe reigning Prince, Otto Johann Friedrich, a young man of imperfect\neducation, questionable valour, and no scintilla of capacity, has fallen\ninto entire public contempt.  It was with difficulty that I obtained an\ninterview, for he is frequently absent from a court where his presence is\nunheeded, and where his only rôle is to be a cloak for the amours of his\nwife.  At last, however, on the third occasion when I visited the palace,\nI found this sovereign in the exercise of his inglorious function, with\nthe wife on one hand, and the lover on the other.  He is not ill-looking;\nhe has hair of a ruddy gold, which naturally curls, and his eyes are\ndark, a combination which I always regard as the mark of some congenital\ndeficiency, physical or moral; his features are irregular, but pleasing;\nthe nose perhaps a little short, and the mouth a little womanish; his\naddress is excellent, and he can express himself with point.  But to\npierce below these externals is to come on a vacuity of any sterling\nquality, a deliquescence of the moral nature, a frivolity and\ninconsequence of purpose that mark the nearly perfect fruit of a decadent\nage.  He has a worthless smattering of many subjects, but a grasp of\nnone.  ‘I soon weary of a pursuit,’ he said to me, laughing; it would\nalmost appear as if he took a pride in his incapacity and lack of moral\ncourage.  The results of his dilettanteism are to be seen in every field;\nhe is a bad fencer, a second-rate horseman, dancer, shot; he sings—I have\nheard him—and he sings like a child; he writes intolerable verses in more\nthan doubtful French; he acts like the common amateur; and in short there\nis no end to the number of the things that he does, and does badly.  His\none manly taste is for the chase.  In sum, he is but a plexus of\nweaknesses; the singing chambermaid of the stage, tricked out in man’s\napparel, and mounted on a circus horse.  I have seen this poor phantom of\na prince riding out alone or with a few huntsmen, disregarded by all, and\nI have been even grieved for the bearer of so futile and melancholy an\nexistence.  The last Merovingians may have looked not otherwise.\n\nThe Princess Amalia Seraphina, a daughter of the Grand-Ducal house of\nToggenburg-Tannhäuser, would be equally inconsiderable if she were not a\ncutting instrument in the hands of an ambitious man.  She is much younger\nthan the Prince, a girl of two-and-twenty, sick with vanity,\nsuperficially clever, and fundamentally a fool.  She has a red-brown\nrolling eye, too large for her face, and with sparks of both levity and\nferocity; her forehead is high and narrow, her figure thin and a little\nstooping.  Her manners, her conversation, which she interlards with\nFrench, her very tastes and ambitions, are alike assumed; and the\nassumption is ungracefully apparent: Hoyden playing Cleopatra.  I should\njudge her to be incapable of truth.  In private life a girl of this\ndescription embroils the peace of families, walks attended by a troop of\nscowling swains, and passes, once at least, through the divorce court; it\nis a common and, except to the cynic, an uninteresting type.  On the\nthrone, however, and in the hands of a man like Gondremark, she may\nbecome the authoress of serious public evils.\n\nGondremark, the true ruler of this unfortunate country, is a more complex\nstudy.  His position in Grünewald, to which he is a foreigner, is\neminently false; and that he should maintain it as he does, a very\nmiracle of impudence and dexterity.  His speech, his face, his policy,\nare all double: heads and tails.  Which of the two extremes may be his\nactual design he were a bold man who should offer to decide.  Yet I will\nhazard the guess that he follows both experimentally, and awaits, at the\nhand of destiny, one of those directing hints of which she is so lavish\nto the wise.\n\nOn the one hand, as _Maire du Palais_ to the incompetent Otto, and using\nthe love-sick Princess for a tool and mouthpiece, he pursues a policy of\narbitrary power and territorial aggrandisement.  He has called out the\nwhole capable male population of the state to military service; he has\nbought cannon; he has tempted away promising officers from foreign\narmies; and he now begins, in his international relations, to assume the\nswaggering port and the vague, threatful language of a bully.  The idea\nof extending Grünewald may appear absurd, but the little state is\nadvantageously placed, its neighbours are all defenceless; and if at any\nmoment the jealousies of the greater courts should neutralise each other,\nan active policy might double the principality both in population and\nextent.  Certainly at least the scheme is entertained in the court of\nMittwalden; nor do I myself regard it as entirely desperate.  The\nmargravate of Brandenburg has grown from as small beginnings to a\nformidable power; and though it is late in the day to try adventurous\npolicies, and the age of war seems ended, Fortune, we must not forget,\nstill blindly turns her wheel for men and nations.  Concurrently with,\nand tributary to, these warlike preparations, crushing taxes have been\nlevied, journals have been suppressed, and the country, which three years\nago was prosperous and happy, now stagnates in a forced inaction, gold\nhas become a curiosity, and the mills stand idle on the mountain streams.\n\nOn the other hand, in his second capacity of popular tribune, Gondremark\nis the incarnation of the free lodges, and sits at the centre of an\norganised conspiracy against the state.  To any such movement my\nsympathies were early acquired, and I would not willingly let fall a word\nthat might embarrass or retard the revolution.  But to show that I speak\nof knowledge, and not as the reporter of mere gossip, I may mention that\nI have myself been present at a meeting where the details of a republican\nConstitution were minutely debated and arranged; and I may add that\nGondremark was throughout referred to by the speakers as their captain in\naction and the arbiter of their disputes.  He has taught his dupes (for\nso I must regard them) that his power of resistance to the Princess is\nlimited, and at each fresh stretch of authority persuades them, with\nspecious reasons, to postpone the hour of insurrection.  Thus (to give\nsome instances of his astute diplomacy) he salved over the decree\nenforcing military service, under the plea that to be well drilled and\nexercised in arms was even a necessary preparation for revolt.  And the\nother day, when it began to be rumoured abroad that a war was being\nforced on a reluctant neighbour, the Grand Duke of Gerolstein, and I made\nsure it would be the signal for an instant rising, I was struck dumb with\nwonder to find that even this had been prepared and was to be accepted.\nI went from one to another in the Liberal camp, and all were in the same\nstory, all had been drilled and schooled and fitted out with vacuous\nargument.  ‘The lads had better see some real fighting,’ they said; ‘and\nbesides, it will be as well to capture Gerolstein: we can then extend to\nour neighbours the blessing of liberty on the same day that we snatch it\nfor ourselves; and the republic will be all the stronger to resist, if\nthe kings of Europe should band themselves together to reduce it.’  I\nknow not which of the two I should admire the more: the simplicity of the\nmultitude or the audacity of the adventurer.  But such are the\nsubtleties, such the quibbling reasons, with which he blinds and leads\nthis people.  How long a course so tortuous can be pursued with safety I\nam incapable of guessing; not long, one would suppose; and yet this\nsingular man has been treading the mazes for five years, and his favour\nat court and his popularity among the lodges still endure unbroken.\n\nI have the privilege of slightly knowing him.  Heavily and somewhat\nclumsily built, of a vast, disjointed, rambling frame, he can still pull\nhimself together, and figure, not without admiration, in the saloon or\nthe ball-room.  His hue and temperament are plentifully bilious; he has a\nsaturnine eye; his cheek is of a dark blue where he has been shaven.\nEssentially he is to be numbered among the man-haters, a convinced\ncontemner of his fellows.  Yet he is himself of a commonplace ambition\nand greedy of applause.  In talk, he is remarkable for a thirst of\ninformation, loving rather to hear than to communicate; for sound and\nstudious views; and, judging by the extreme short-sightedness of common\npoliticians, for a remarkable provision of events.  All this, however,\nwithout grace, pleasantry, or charm, heavily set forth, with a dull\ncountenance.  In our numerous conversations, although he has always heard\nme with deference, I have been conscious throughout of a sort of\nponderous finessing hard to tolerate.  He produces none of the effect of\na gentleman; devoid not merely of pleasantry, but of all attention or\ncommunicative warmth of bearing.  No gentleman, besides, would so parade\nhis amours with the Princess; still less repay the Prince for his\nlong-suffering with a studied insolence of demeanour and the fabrication\nof insulting nicknames, such as Prince Featherhead, which run from ear to\near and create a laugh throughout the country.  Gondremark has thus some\nof the clumsier characters of the self-made man, combined with an\ninordinate, almost a besotted, pride of intellect and birth.  Heavy,\nbilious, selfish, inornate, he sits upon this court and country like an\nincubus.\n\nBut it is probable that he preserves softer gifts for necessary purposes.\nIndeed, it is certain, although he vouchsafed none of it to me, that this\ncold and stolid politician possesses to a great degree the art of\ningratiation, and can be all things to all men.  Hence there has probably\nsprung up the idle legend that in private life he is a gross romping\nvoluptuary.  Nothing, at least, can well be more surprising than the\nterms of his connection with the Princess.  Older than her husband,\ncertainly uglier, and, according to the feeble ideas common among women,\nin every particular less pleasing, he has not only seized the complete\ncommand of all her thought and action, but has imposed on her in public a\nhumiliating part.  I do not here refer to the complete sacrifice of every\nrag of her reputation; for to many women these extremities are in\nthemselves attractive.  But there is about the court a certain lady of a\ndishevelled reputation, a Countess von Rosen, wife or widow of a cloudy\ncount, no longer in her second youth, and already bereft of some of her\nattractions, who unequivocally occupies the station of the Baron’s\nmistress.  I had thought, at first, that she was but a hired accomplice,\na mere blind or buffer for the more important sinner.  A few hours’\nacquaintance with Madame von Rosen for ever dispelled the illusion.  She\nis one rather to make than to prevent a scandal, and she values none of\nthose bribes—money, honours, or employment—with which the situation might\nbe gilded.  Indeed, as a person frankly bad, she pleased me, in the court\nof Grünewald, like a piece of nature.\n\nThe power of this man over the Princess is, therefore, without bounds.\nShe has sacrificed to the adoration with which he has inspired her not\nonly her marriage vow and every shred of public decency, but that vice of\njealousy which is so much dearer to the female sex than either intrinsic\nhonour or outward consideration.  Nay, more: a young, although not a very\nattractive woman, and a princess both by birth and fact, she submits to\nthe triumphant rivalry of one who might be her mother as to years, and\nwho is so manifestly her inferior in station.  This is one of the\nmysteries of the human heart.  But the rage of illicit love, when it is\nonce indulged, appears to grow by feeding; and to a person of the\ncharacter and temperament of this unfortunate young lady, almost any\ndepth of degradation is within the reach of possibility.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—THE PRINCE AND THE ENGLISH TRAVELLER\n\n\nSo far Otto read, with waxing indignation; and here his fury overflowed.\nHe tossed the roll upon the table and stood up.  ‘This man,’ he said, ‘is\na devil.  A filthy imagination, an ear greedy of evil, a ponderous\nmalignity of thought and language: I grow like him by the reading!\nChancellor, where is this fellow lodged?’\n\n‘He was committed to the Flag Tower,’ replied Greisengesang, ‘in the\nGamiani apartment.’\n\n‘Lead me to him,’ said the Prince; and then, a thought striking him, ‘Was\nit for that,’ he asked, ‘that I found so many sentries in the garden?’\n\n‘Your Highness, I am unaware,’ answered Greisengesang, true to his\npolicy.  ‘The disposition of the guards is a matter distinct from my\nfunctions.’\n\nOtto turned upon the old man fiercely, but ere he had time to speak,\nGotthold touched him on the arm.  He swallowed his wrath with a great\neffort.  ‘It is well,’ he said, taking the roll.  ‘Follow me to the Flag\nTower.’\n\nThe Chancellor gathered himself together, and the two set forward.  It\nwas a long and complicated voyage; for the library was in the wing of the\nnew buildings, and the tower which carried the flag was in the old\nschloss upon the garden.  By a great variety of stairs and corridors,\nthey came out at last upon a patch of gravelled court; the garden peeped\nthrough a high grating with a flash of green; tall, old gabled buildings\nmounted on every side; the Flag Tower climbed, stage after stage, into\nthe blue; and high over all, among the building daws, the yellow flag\nwavered in the wind.  A sentinel at the foot of the tower stairs\npresented arms; another paced the first landing; and a third was\nstationed before the door of the extemporised prison.\n\n‘We guard this mud-bag like a jewel,’ Otto sneered.\n\nThe Gamiani apartment was so called from an Italian doctor who had\nimposed on the credulity of a former prince.  The rooms were large, airy,\npleasant, and looked upon the garden; but the walls were of great\nthickness (for the tower was old), and the windows were heavily barred.\nThe Prince, followed by the Chancellor, still trotting to keep up with\nhim, brushed swiftly through the little library and the long saloon, and\nburst like a thunderbolt into the bedroom at the farther end.  Sir John\nwas finishing his toilet; a man of fifty, hard, uncompromising, able,\nwith the eye and teeth of physical courage.  He was unmoved by the\nirruption, and bowed with a sort of sneering ease.\n\n‘To what am I to attribute the honour of this visit?’ he asked.\n\n‘You have eaten my bread,’ replied Otto, ‘you have taken my hand, you\nhave been received under my roof.  When did I fail you in courtesy?  What\nhave you asked that was not granted as to an honoured guest?  And here,\nsir,’ tapping fiercely on the manuscript, ‘here is your return.’\n\n‘Your Highness has read my papers?’ said the Baronet.  ‘I am honoured\nindeed.  But the sketch is most imperfect.  I shall now have much to add.\nI can say that the Prince, whom I had accused of idleness, is zealous in\nthe department of police, taking upon himself those duties that are most\ndistasteful.  I shall be able to relate the burlesque incident of my\narrest, and the singular interview with which you honour me at present.\nFor the rest, I have already communicated with my Ambassador at Vienna;\nand unless you propose to murder me, I shall be at liberty, whether you\nplease or not, within the week.  For I hardly fancy the future empire of\nGrünewald is yet ripe to go to war with England.  I conceive I am a\nlittle more than quits.  I owe you no explanation; yours has been the\nwrong.  You, if you have studied my writing with intelligence, owe me a\nlarge debt of gratitude.  And to conclude, as I have not yet finished my\ntoilet, I imagine the courtesy of a turnkey to a prisoner would induce\nyou to withdraw.’\n\nThere was some paper on the table, and Otto, sitting down, wrote a\npassport in the name of Sir John Crabtree.\n\n‘Affix the seal, Herr Cancellarius,’ he said, in his most princely\nmanner, as he rose.\n\nGreisengesang produced a red portfolio, and affixed the seal in the\nunpoetic guise of an adhesive stamp; nor did his perturbed and clumsy\nmovements at all lessen the comedy of the performance.  Sir John looked\non with a malign enjoyment; and Otto chafed, regretting, when too late,\nthe unnecessary royalty of his command and gesture.  But at length the\nChancellor had finished his piece of prestidigitation, and, without\nwaiting for an order, had countersigned the passport.  Thus regularised,\nhe returned it to Otto with a bow.\n\n‘You will now,’ said the Prince, ‘order one of my own carriages to be\nprepared; see it, with your own eyes, charged with Sir John’s effects,\nand have it waiting within the hour behind the Pheasant House.  Sir John\ndeparts this morning for Vienna.’\n\nThe Chancellor took his elaborate departure.\n\n‘Here, sir, is your passport,’ said Otto, turning to the Baronet.  ‘I\nregret it from my heart that you have met inhospitable usage.’\n\n‘Well, there will be no English war,’ returned Sir John.\n\n‘Nay, sir,’ said Otto, ‘you surely owe me your civility.  Matters are now\nchanged, and we stand again upon the footing of two gentlemen.  It was\nnot I who ordered your arrest; I returned late last night from hunting;\nand as you cannot blame me for your imprisonment, you may even thank me\nfor your freedom.’\n\n‘And yet you read my papers,’ said the traveller shrewdly.\n\n‘There, sir, I was wrong,’ returned Otto; ‘and for that I ask your\npardon.  You can scarce refuse it, for your own dignity, to one who is a\nplexus of weaknesses.  Nor was the fault entirely mine.  Had the papers\nbeen innocent, it would have been at most an indiscretion.  Your own\nguilt is the sting of my offence.’\n\nSir John regarded Otto with an approving twinkle; then he bowed, but\nstill in silence.\n\n‘Well, sir, as you are now at your entire disposal, I have a favour to\nbeg of your indulgence,’ continued the Prince.  ‘I have to request that\nyou will walk with me alone into the garden so soon as your convenience\npermits.’\n\n‘From the moment that I am a free man,’ Sir John replied, this time with\nperfect courtesy, ‘I am wholly at your Highness’s command; and if you\nwill excuse a rather summary toilet, I will even follow you, as I am.’\n\n‘I thank you, sir,’ said Otto.\n\nSo without more delay, the Prince leading, the pair proceeded down\nthrough the echoing stairway of the tower, and out through the grating,\ninto the ample air and sunshine of the morning, and among the terraces\nand flower-beds of the garden.  They crossed the fish-pond, where the\ncarp were leaping as thick as bees; they mounted, one after another, the\nvarious flights of stairs, snowed upon, as they went, with April\nblossoms, and marching in time to the great orchestra of birds.  Nor did\nOtto pause till they had reached the highest terrace of the garden.  Here\nwas a gate into the park, and hard by, under a tuft of laurel, a marble\ngarden seat.  Hence they looked down on the green tops of many elm-trees,\nwhere the rooks were busy; and, beyond that, upon the palace roof, and\nthe yellow banner flying in the blue.  I pray you to be seated, sir,’\nsaid Otto.\n\nSir John complied without a word; and for some seconds Otto walked to and\nfro before him, plunged in angry thought.  The birds were all singing for\na wager.\n\n‘Sir,’ said the Prince at length, turning towards the Englishman, ‘you\nare to me, except by the conventions of society, a perfect stranger.  Of\nyour character and wishes I am ignorant.  I have never wittingly\ndisobliged you.  There is a difference in station, which I desire to\nwaive.  I would, if you still think me entitled to so much\nconsideration—I would be regarded simply as a gentleman.  Now, sir, I did\nwrong to glance at these papers, which I here return to you; but if\ncuriosity be undignified, as I am free to own, falsehood is both cowardly\nand cruel.  I opened your roll; and what did I find—what did I find about\nmy wife; Lies!’ he broke out.  ‘They are lies!  There are not, so help me\nGod! four words of truth in your intolerable libel!  You are a man; you\nare old, and might be the girl’s father; you are a gentleman; you are a\nscholar, and have learned refinement; and you rake together all this\nvulgar scandal, and propose to print it in a public book!  Such is your\nchivalry!  But, thank God, sir, she has still a husband.  You say, sir,\nin that paper in your hand, that I am a bad fencer; I have to request\nfrom you a lesson in the art.  The park is close behind; yonder is the\nPheasant House, where you will find your carriage; should I fall, you\nknow, sir—you have written it in your paper—how little my movements are\nregarded; I am in the custom of disappearing; it will be one more\ndisappearance; and long before it has awakened a remark, you may be safe\nacross the border.’\n\n‘You will observe,’ said Sir John, ‘that what you ask is impossible.’\n\n‘And if I struck you?’ cried the Prince, with a sudden menacing flash.\n\n‘It would be a cowardly blow,’ returned the Baronet, unmoved, ‘for it\nwould make no change.  I cannot draw upon a reigning sovereign.’\n\n‘And it is this man, to whom you dare not offer satisfaction, that you\nchoose to insult!’ cried Otto.\n\n‘Pardon me,’ said the traveller, ‘you are unjust.  It is because you are\na reigning sovereign that I cannot fight with you; and it is for the same\nreason that I have a right to criticise your action and your wife.  You\nare in everything a public creature; you belong to the public, body and\nbone.  You have with you the law, the muskets of the army, and the eyes\nof spies.  We, on our side, have but one weapon—truth.’\n\n‘Truth!’ echoed the Prince, with a gesture.\n\nThere was another silence.\n\n‘Your Highness,’ said Sir John at last, ‘you must not expect grapes from\na thistle.  I am old and a cynic.  Nobody cares a rush for me; and on the\nwhole, after the present interview, I scarce know anybody that I like\nbetter than yourself.  You see, I have changed my mind, and have the\nuncommon virtue to avow the change.  I tear up this stuff before you,\nhere in your own garden; I ask your pardon, I ask the pardon of the\nPrincess; and I give you my word of honour as a gentleman and an old man,\nthat when my book of travels shall appear it shall not contain so much as\nthe name of Grünewald.  And yet it was a racy chapter!  But had your\nHighness only read about the other courts!  I am a carrion crow; but it\nis not my fault, after all, that the world is such a nauseous kennel.’\n\n‘Sir,’ said Otto, ‘is the eye not jaundiced?’\n\n‘Nay,’ cried the traveller, ‘very likely.  I am one who goes sniffing; I\nam no poet.  I believe in a better future for the world; or, at all\naccounts, I do most potently disbelieve in the present.  Rotten eggs is\nthe burthen of my song.  But indeed, your Highness, when I meet with any\nmerit, I do not think that I am slow to recognise it.  This is a day that\nI shall still recall with gratitude, for I have found a sovereign with\nsome manly virtues; and for once—old courtier and old radical as I am—it\nis from the heart and quite sincerely that I can request the honour of\nkissing your Highness’s hand?’\n\n‘Nay, sir,’ said Otto, ‘to my heart!’\n\nAnd the Englishman, taken at unawares, was clasped for a moment in the\nPrince’s arms.\n\n‘And now, sir,’ added Otto, ‘there is the Pheasant House; close behind it\nyou will find my carriage, which I pray you to accept.  God speed you to\nVienna!’\n\n‘In the impetuosity of youth,’ replied Sir John, ‘your Highness has\noverlooked one circumstance.  I am still fasting.’\n\n‘Well, sir,’ said Otto, smiling, ‘you are your own master; you may go or\nstay.  But I warn you, your friend may prove less powerful than your\nenemies.  The Prince, indeed, is thoroughly on your side; he has all the\nwill to help; but to whom do I speak?—you know better than I do, he is\nnot alone in Grünewald.’\n\n‘There is a deal in position,’ returned the traveller, gravely nodding.\n‘Gondremark loves to temporise; his policy is below ground, and he fears\nall open courses; and now that I have seen you act with so much spirit, I\nwill cheerfully risk myself on your protection.  Who knows?  You may be\nyet the better man.’\n\n‘Do you indeed believe so?’ cried the Prince.  ‘You put life into my\nheart!’\n\n‘I will give up sketching portraits,’ said the Baronet.  ‘I am a blind\nowl; I had misread you strangely.  And yet remember this; a sprint is one\nthing, and to run all day another.  For I still mistrust your\nconstitution; the short nose, the hair and eyes of several complexions;\nno, they are diagnostic; and I must end, I see, as I began.’\n\n‘I am still a singing chambermaid?’ said Otto.\n\n‘Nay, your Highness, I pray you to forget what I had written,’ said Sir\nJohn; ‘I am not like Pilate; and the chapter is no more.  Bury it, if you\nlove me.’\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—WHILE THE PRINCE IS IN THE ANTE-ROOM . . .\n\n\nGreatly comforted by the exploits of the morning, the Prince turned\ntowards the Princess’s ante-room, bent on a more difficult enterprise.\nThe curtains rose before him, the usher called his name, and he entered\nthe room with an exaggeration of his usual mincing and airy dignity.\nThere were about a score of persons waiting, principally ladies; it was\none of the few societies in Grünewald where Otto knew himself to be\npopular; and while a maid of honour made her exit by a side door to\nannounce his arrival to the Princess, he moved round the apartment,\ncollecting homage and bestowing compliments with friendly grace.  Had\nthis been the sum of his duties, he had been an admirable monarch.  Lady\nafter lady was impartially honoured by his attention.\n\n‘Madam,’ he said to one, ‘how does this happen?  I find you daily more\nadorable.’\n\n‘And your Highness daily browner,’ replied the lady.  ‘We began equal; O,\nthere I will be bold: we have both beautiful complexions.  But while I\nstudy mine, your Highness tans himself.’\n\n‘A perfect negro, madam; and what so fitly—being beauty’s slave?’ said\nOtto.—‘Madame Grafinski, when is our next play?  I have just heard that I\nam a bad actor.’\n\n‘_O ciel_!’ cried Madame Grafinski.  ‘Who could venture?  What a bear!’\n\n‘An excellent man, I can assure you,’ returned Otto.\n\n‘O, never!  O, is it possible!’ fluted the lady.  ‘Your Highness plays\nlike an angel.’\n\n‘You must be right, madam; who could speak falsely and yet look so\ncharming?’ said the Prince.  ‘But this gentleman, it seems, would have\npreferred me playing like an actor.’\n\nA sort of hum, a falsetto, feminine cooing, greeted the tiny sally; and\nOtto expanded like a peacock.  This warm atmosphere of women and flattery\nand idle chatter pleased him to the marrow.\n\n‘Madame von Eisenthal, your coiffure is delicious,’ he remarked.\n\n‘Every one was saying so,’ said one.\n\n‘If I have pleased Prince Charming?’  And Madame von Eisenthal swept him\na deep curtsy with a killing glance of adoration.\n\n‘It is new?’ he asked.  ‘Vienna fashion.’\n\n‘Mint new,’ replied the lady, ‘for your Highness’s return.  I felt young\nthis morning; it was a premonition.  But why, Prince, do you ever leave\nus?’\n\n‘For the pleasure of the return,’ said Otto.  ‘I am like a dog; I must\nbury my bone, and then come back to great upon it.’\n\n‘O, a bone!  Fie, what a comparison!  You have brought back the manners\nof the wood,’ returned the lady.\n\n‘Madam, it is what the dog has dearest,’ said the Prince.  ‘But I observe\nMadame von Rosen.’\n\nAnd Otto, leaving the group to which he had been piping, stepped towards\nthe embrasure of a window where a lady stood.\n\nThe Countess von Rosen had hitherto been silent, and a thought depressed,\nbut on the approach of Otto she began to brighten.  She was tall, slim as\na nymph, and of a very airy carriage; and her face, which was already\nbeautiful in repose, lightened and changed, flashed into smiles, and\nglowed with lovely colour at the touch of animation.  She was a good\nvocalist; and, even in speech, her voice commanded a great range of\nchanges, the low notes rich with tenor quality, the upper ringing, on the\nbrink of laughter, into music.  A gem of many facets and variable hues of\nfire; a woman who withheld the better portion of her beauty, and then, in\na caressing second, flashed it like a weapon full on the beholder; now\nmerely a tall figure and a sallow handsome face, with the evidences of a\nreckless temper; anon opening like a flower to life and colour, mirth and\ntenderness:—Madame von Rosen had always a dagger in reserve for the\ndespatch of ill-assured admirers.  She met Otto with the dart of tender\ngaiety.\n\n‘You have come to me at last, Prince Cruel,’ she said.  ‘Butterfly!\nWell, and am I not to kiss your hand?’ she added.\n\n‘Madam, it is I who must kiss yours.’  And Otto bowed and kissed it.\n\n‘You deny me every indulgence,’ she said, smiling.\n\n‘And now what news in Court?’ inquired the Prince.  ‘I come to you for my\ngazette.’\n\n‘Ditch-water!’ she replied.  ‘The world is all asleep, grown grey in\nslumber; I do not remember any waking movement since quite an eternity;\nand the last thing in the nature of a sensation was the last time my\ngoverness was allowed to box my ears.  But yet I do myself and your\nunfortunate enchanted palace some injustice.  Here is the last—O\npositively!’  And she told him the story from behind her fan, with many\nglances, many cunning strokes of the narrator’s art.  The others had\ndrawn away, for it was understood that Madame von Rosen was in favour\nwith the Prince.  None the less, however, did the Countess lower her\nvoice at times to within a semitone of whispering; and the pair leaned\ntogether over the narrative.\n\n‘Do you know,’ said Otto, laughing, ‘you are the only entertaining woman\non this earth!’\n\n‘O, you have found out so much,’ she cried.\n\n‘Yes, madam, I grow wiser with advancing years,’ he returned.\n\n‘Years,’ she repeated.  ‘Do you name the traitors?  I do not believe in\nyears; the calendar is a delusion.’\n\n‘You must be right, madam,’ replied the Prince.  ‘For six years that we\nhave been good friends, I have observed you to grow younger.’\n\n‘Flatterer!’ cried she, and then with a change, ‘But why should I say\nso,’ she added, ‘when I protest I think the same?  A week ago I had a\ncouncil with my father director, the glass; and the glass replied, “Not\nyet!”  I confess my face in this way once a month.  O! a very solemn\nmoment.  Do you know what I shall do when the mirror answers, “Now”?’\n\n‘I cannot guess,’ said he.\n\n‘No more can I,’ returned the Countess.  ‘There is such a choice!\nSuicide, gambling, a nunnery, a volume of memoirs, or politics—the last,\nI am afraid.’\n\n‘It is a dull trade,’ said Otto.\n\n‘Nay,’ she replied, ‘it is a trade I rather like.  It is, after all,\nfirst cousin to gossip, which no one can deny to be amusing.  For\ninstance, if I were to tell you that the Princess and the Baron rode out\ntogether daily to inspect the cannon, it is either a piece of politics or\nscandal, as I turn my phrase.  I am the alchemist that makes the\ntransmutation.  They have been everywhere together since you left,’ she\ncontinued, brightening as she saw Otto darken; ‘that is a poor snippet of\nmalicious gossip—and they were everywhere cheered—and with that addition\nall becomes political intelligence.’\n\n‘Let us change the subject,’ said Otto.\n\n‘I was about to propose it,’ she replied, ‘or rather to pursue the\npolitics.  Do you know? this war is popular—popular to the length of\ncheering Princess Seraphina.’\n\n‘All things, madam, are possible,’ said the Prince; and this among\nothers, that we may be going into war, but I give you my word of honour I\ndo not know with whom.’\n\n‘And you put up with it?’ she cried.  ‘I have no pretensions to morality;\nand I confess I have always abominated the lamb, and nourished a romantic\nfeeling for the wolf.  O, be done with lambiness!  Let us see there is a\nprince, for I am weary of the distaff.’\n\n‘Madam,’ said Otto, ‘I thought you were of that faction.’\n\n‘I should be of yours, _mon Prince_, if you had one,’ she retorted.  ‘Is\nit true that you have no ambition?  There was a man once in England whom\nthey call the kingmaker.  Do you know,’ she added, ‘I fancy I could make\na prince?’\n\n‘Some day, madam,’ said Otto, ‘I may ask you to help make a farmer.’\n\n‘Is that a riddle?’ asked the Countess.\n\n‘It is,’ replied the Prince, ‘and a very good one too.’\n\n‘Tit for tat.  I will ask you another,’ she returned.  ‘Where is\nGondremark?’\n\n‘The Prime Minister?  In the prime-ministry, no doubt,’ said Otto.\n\n‘Precisely,’ said the Countess; and she pointed with her fan to the door\nof the Princess’s apartments.  ‘You and I, _mon Prince_, are in the\nante-room.  You think me unkind,’ she added.  ‘Try me and you will see.\nSet me a task, put me a question; there is no enormity I am not capable\nof doing to oblige you, and no secret that I am not ready to betray.’\n\n‘Nay, madam, but I respect my friend too much,’ he answered, kissing her\nhand.  ‘I would rather remain ignorant of all.  We fraternise like foemen\nsoldiers at the outposts, but let each be true to his own army.’\n\n‘Ah,’ she cried, ‘if all men were generous like you, it would be worth\nwhile to be a woman!’  Yet, judging by her looks, his generosity, if\nanything, had disappointed her; she seemed to seek a remedy, and, having\nfound it, brightened once more.  ‘And now,’ she said, ‘may I dismiss my\nsovereign?  This is rebellion and a _cas pendable_; but what am I to do?\nMy bear is jealous!’\n\n‘Madam, enough!’ cried Otto.  ‘Ahasuerus reaches you the sceptre; more,\nhe will obey you in all points.  I should have been a dog to come to\nwhistling.’\n\nAnd so the Prince departed, and fluttered round Grafinski and von\nEisenthal.  But the Countess knew the use of her offensive weapons, and\nhad left a pleasant arrow in the Prince’s heart.  That Gondremark was\njealous—here was an agreeable revenge!  And Madame von Rosen, as the\noccasion of the jealousy, appeared to him in a new light.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—. . . GONDREMARK IS IN MY LADY’S CHAMBER\n\n\nThe Countess von Rosen spoke the truth.  The great Prime Minister of\nGrünewald was already closeted with Seraphina.  The toilet was over; and\nthe Princess, tastefully arrayed, sat face to face with a tall mirror.\nSir John’s description was unkindly true, true in terms and yet a libel,\na misogynistic masterpiece.  Her forehead was perhaps too high, but it\nbecame her; her figure somewhat stooped, but every detail was formed and\nfinished like a gem; her hand, her foot, her ear, the set of her comely\nhead, were all dainty and accordant; if she was not beautiful, she was\nvivid, changeful, coloured, and pretty with a thousand various\nprettinesses; and her eyes, if they indeed rolled too consciously, yet\nrolled to purpose.  They were her most attractive feature, yet they\ncontinually bore eloquent false witness to her thoughts; for while she\nherself, in the depths of her immature, unsoftened heart, was given\naltogether to manlike ambition and the desire of power, the eyes were by\nturns bold, inviting, fiery, melting, and artful, like the eyes of a\nrapacious siren.  And artful, in a sense, she was.  Chafing that she was\nnot a man, and could not shine by action, she had conceived a woman’s\npart, of answerable domination; she sought to subjugate for by-ends, to\nrain influence and be fancy free; and, while she loved not man, loved to\nsee man obey her.  It is a common girl’s ambition.  Such was perhaps that\nlady of the glove, who sent her lover to the lions.  But the snare is\nlaid alike for male and female, and the world most artfully contrived.\n\nNear her, in a low chair, Gondremark had arranged his limbs into a\ncat-like attitude, high-shouldered, stooping, and submiss.  The\nformidable blue jowl of the man, and the dull bilious eye, set perhaps a\nhigher value on his evident desire to please.  His face was marked by\ncapacity, temper, and a kind of bold, piratical dishonesty which it would\nbe calumnious to call deceit.  His manners, as he smiled upon the\nPrincess, were over-fine, yet hardly elegant.\n\n‘Possibly,’ said the Baron, ‘I should now proceed to take my leave.  I\nmust not keep my sovereign in the ante-room.  Let us come at once to a\ndecision.’\n\n‘It cannot, cannot be put off?’ she asked.\n\n‘It is impossible,’ answered Gondremark.  ‘Your Highness sees it for\nherself.  In the earlier stages, we might imitate the serpent; but for\nthe ultimatum, there is no choice but to be bold like lions.  Had the\nPrince chosen to remain away, it had been better; but we have gone too\nfar forward to delay.’\n\n‘What can have brought him?’ she cried.  ‘To-day of all days?’\n\n‘The marplot, madam, has the instinct of his nature,’ returned\nGondremark.  ‘But you exaggerate the peril.  Think, madam, how far we\nhave prospered, and against what odds!  Shall a Featherhead?—but no!’\nAnd he blew upon his fingers lightly with a laugh.\n\n‘Featherhead,’ she replied, ‘is still the Prince of Grünewald.’\n\n‘On your sufferance only, and so long as you shall please to be\nindulgent,’ said the Baron.  ‘There are rights of nature; power to the\npowerful is the law.  If he shall think to cross your destiny—well, you\nhave heard of the brazen and the earthen pot.’\n\n‘Do you call me pot?  You are ungallant, Baron,’ laughed the Princess.\n\n‘Before we are done with your glory, I shall have called you by many\ndifferent titles,’ he replied.\n\nThe girl flushed with pleasure.  ‘But Frédéric is still the Prince,\n_monsieur le flatteur_,’ she said.  ‘You do not propose a revolution?—you\nof all men?’\n\n‘Dear madam, when it is already made!’ he cried.  ‘The Prince reigns\nindeed in the almanac; but my Princess reigns and rules.’  And he looked\nat her with a fond admiration that made the heart of Seraphina swell.\nLooking on her huge slave, she drank the intoxicating joys of power.\nMeanwhile he continued, with that sort of massive archness that so ill\nbecame him, ‘She has but one fault; there is but one danger in the great\ncareer that I foresee for her.  May I name it? may I be so irreverent?\nIt is in herself—her heart is soft.’\n\n‘Her courage is faint, Baron,’ said the Princess.  ‘Suppose we have\njudged ill, suppose we were defeated?’\n\n‘Defeated, madam?’ returned the Baron, with a touch of ill-humour.  ‘Is\nthe dog defeated by the hare?  Our troops are all cantoned along the\nfrontier; in five hours the vanguard of five thousand bayonets shall be\nhammering on the gates of Brandenau; and in all Gerolstein there are not\nfifteen hundred men who can manœuvre.  It is as simple as a sum.  There\ncan be no resistance.’\n\n‘It is no great exploit,’ she said.  ‘Is that what you call glory?  It is\nlike beating a child.’\n\n‘The courage, madam, is diplomatic,’ he replied.  ‘We take a grave step;\nwe fix the eyes of Europe, for the first time, on Grünewald; and in the\nnegotiations of the next three months, mark me, we stand or fall.  It is\nthere, madam, that I shall have to depend upon your counsels,’ he added,\nalmost gloomily.  ‘If I had not seen you at work, if I did not know the\nfertility of your mind, I own I should tremble for the consequence.  But\nit is in this field that men must recognise their inability.  All the\ngreat negotiators, when they have not been women, have had women at their\nelbows.  Madame de Pompadour was ill served; she had not found her\nGondremark; but what a mighty politician!  Catherine de’ Medici, too,\nwhat justice of sight, what readiness of means, what elasticity against\ndefeat!  But alas! madam, her Featherheads were her own children; and she\nhad that one touch of vulgarity, that one trait of the good-wife, that\nshe suffered family ties and affections to confine her liberty.’\n\nThese singular views of history, strictly _ad usum Seraphinæ_, did not\nweave their usual soothing spell over the Princess.  It was plain that\nshe had taken a momentary distaste to her own resolutions; for she\ncontinued to oppose her counsellor, looking upon him out of half-closed\neyes and with the shadow of a sneer upon her lips.  ‘What boys men are!’\nshe said; ‘what lovers of big words!  Courage, indeed!  If you had to\nscour pans, Herr Von Gondremark, you would call it, I suppose, Domestic\nCourage?’\n\n‘I would, madam,’ said the Baron stoutly, ‘if I scoured them well.  I\nwould put a good name upon a virtue; you will not overdo it: they are not\nso enchanting in themselves.’\n\n‘Well, but let me see,’ she said.  ‘I wish to understand your courage.\nWhy we asked leave, like children!  Our grannie in Berlin, our uncle in\nVienna, the whole family, have patted us on the head and sent us forward.\nCourage?  I wonder when I hear you!’\n\n‘My Princess is unlike herself,’ returned the Baron.  ‘She has forgotten\nwhere the peril lies.  True, we have received encouragement on every\nhand; but my Princess knows too well on what untenable conditions; and\nshe knows besides how, in the publicity of the diet, these whispered\nconferences are forgotten and disowned.  The danger is very real’—he\nraged inwardly at having to blow the very coal he had been\nquenching—‘none the less real in that it is not precisely military, but\nfor that reason the easier to be faced.  Had we to count upon your\ntroops, although I share your Highness’s expectations of the conduct of\nAlvenau, we cannot forget that he has not been proved in chief command.\nBut where negotiation is concerned, the conduct lies with us; and with\nyour help, I laugh at danger.’\n\n‘It may be so,’ said Seraphina, sighing.  ‘It is elsewhere that I see\ndanger.  The people, these abominable people—suppose they should\ninstantly rebel?  What a figure we should make in the eyes of Europe to\nhave undertaken an invasion while my own throne was tottering to its\nfall!’\n\n‘Nay, madam,’ said Gondremark, smiling, ‘here you are beneath yourself.\nWhat is it that feeds their discontent?  What but the taxes?  Once we\nhave seized Gerolstein, the taxes are remitted, the sons return covered\nwith renown, the houses are adorned with pillage, each tastes his little\nshare of military glory, and behold us once again a happy family!  “Ay,”\nthey will say, in each other’s long ears, “the Princess knew what she was\nabout; she was in the right of it; she has a head upon her shoulders; and\nhere we are, you see, better off than before.”  But why should I say all\nthis?  It is what my Princess pointed out to me herself; it was by these\nreasons that she converted me to this adventure.’\n\n‘I think, Herr von Gondremark,’ said Seraphina, somewhat tartly, ‘you\noften attribute your own sagacity to your Princess.’\n\nFor a second Gondremark staggered under the shrewdness of the attack; the\nnext, he had perfectly recovered.  ‘Do I?’ he said.  ‘It is very\npossible.  I have observed a similar tendency in your Highness.’\n\nIt was so openly spoken, and appeared so just, that Seraphina breathed\nagain.  Her vanity had been alarmed, and the greatness of the relief\nimproved her spirits.  ‘Well,’ she said, ‘all this is little to the\npurpose.  We are keeping Frédéric without, and I am still ignorant of our\nline of battle.  Come, co-admiral, let us consult. . . . How am I to\nreceive him now?  And what are we to do if he should appear at the\ncouncil?’\n\n‘Now,’ he answered.  ‘I shall leave him to my Princess for just now!  I\nhave seen her at work.  Send him off to his theatricals!  But in all\ngentleness,’ he added.  ‘Would it, for instance, would it displease my\nsovereign to affect a headache?’\n\n‘Never!’ said she.  ‘The woman who can manage, like the man who can\nfight, must never shrink from an encounter.  The knight must not disgrace\nhis weapons.’\n\n‘Then let me pray my _belle dame sans merci_,’ he returned, ‘to affect\nthe only virtue that she lacks.  Be pitiful to the poor young man; affect\nan interest in his hunting; be weary of politics; find in his society, as\nit were, a grateful repose from dry considerations.  Does my Princess\nauthorise the line of battle?’\n\n‘Well, that is a trifle,’ answered Seraphina.  ‘The council—there is the\npoint.’\n\n‘The council?’ cried Gondremark.  ‘Permit me, madam.’  And he rose and\nproceeded to flutter about the room, counterfeiting Otto both in voice\nand gesture not unhappily.  ‘What is there to-day, Herr von Gondremark?\nAh, Herr Cancellarius, a new wig!  You cannot deceive me; I know every\nwig in Grünewald; I have the sovereign’s eye.  What are these papers\nabout?  O, I see.  O, certainly.  Surely, surely.  I wager none of you\nremarked that wig.  By all means.  I know nothing about that.  Dear me,\nare there as many as all that?  Well, you can sign them; you have the\nprocuration.  You see, Herr Cancellarius, I knew your wig.  And so,’\nconcluded Gondremark, resuming his own voice, ‘our sovereign, by the\nparticular grace of God, enlightens and supports his privy councillors.’\n\nBut when the Baron turned to Seraphina for approval, he found her frozen.\n‘You are pleased to be witty, Herr von Gondremark,’ she said, ‘and have\nperhaps forgotten where you are.  But these rehearsals are apt to be\nmisleading.  Your master, the Prince of Grünewald, is sometimes more\nexacting.’\n\nGondremark cursed her in his soul.  Of all injured vanities, that of the\nreproved buffoon is the most savage; and when grave issues are involved,\nthese petty stabs become unbearable.  But Gondremark was a man of iron;\nhe showed nothing; he did not even, like the common trickster, retreat\nbecause he had presumed, but held to his point bravely.  ‘Madam,’ he\nsaid, ‘if, as you say, he prove exacting, we must take the bull by the\nhorns.’\n\n‘We shall see,’ she said, and she arranged her skirt like one about to\nrise.  Temper, scorn, disgust, all the more acrid feelings, became her\nlike jewels; and she now looked her best.\n\n‘Pray God they quarrel,’ thought Gondremark.  ‘The damned minx may fail\nme yet, unless they quarrel.  It is time to let him in.  Zz—fight, dogs!’\nConsequent on these reflections, he bent a stiff knee and chivalrously\nkissed the Princess’s hand.  ‘My Princess,’ he said, ‘must now dismiss\nher servant.  I have much to arrange against the hour of council.’\n\n‘Go,’ she said, and rose.\n\nAnd as Gondremark tripped out of a private door, she touched a bell, and\ngave the order to admit the Prince.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—THE PRINCE DELIVERS A LECTURE ON MARRIAGE, WITH PRACTICAL\nILLUSTRATIONS OF DIVORCE\n\n\nWith what a world of excellent intentions Otto entered his wife’s\ncabinet! how fatherly, how tender! how morally affecting were the words\nhe had prepared!  Nor was Seraphina unamiably inclined.  Her usual fear\nof Otto as a marplot in her great designs was now swallowed up in a\npassing distrust of the designs themselves.  For Gondremark, besides, she\nhad conceived an angry horror.  In her heart she did not like the Baron.\nBehind his impudent servility, behind the devotion which, with indelicate\ndelicacy, he still forced on her attention, she divined the grossness of\nhis nature.  So a man may be proud of having tamed a bear, and yet sicken\nat his captive’s odour.  And above all, she had certain jealous\nintimations that the man was false and the deception double.  True, she\nfalsely trifled with his love; but he, perhaps, was only trifling with\nher vanity.  The insolence of his late mimicry, and the odium of her own\nposition as she sat and watched it, lay besides like a load upon her\nconscience.  She met Otto almost with a sense of guilt, and yet she\nwelcomed him as a deliverer from ugly things.\n\nBut the wheels of an interview are at the mercy of a thousand ruts; and\neven at Otto’s entrance, the first jolt occurred.  Gondremark, he saw,\nwas gone; but there was the chair drawn close for consultation; and it\npained him not only that this man had been received, but that he should\ndepart with such an air of secrecy.  Struggling with this twinge, it was\nsomewhat sharply that he dismissed the attendant who had brought him in.\n\n‘You make yourself at home, _chez moi_,’ she said, a little ruffled both\nby his tone of command and by the glance he had thrown upon the chair.\n\n‘Madam,’ replied Otto, ‘I am here so seldom that I have almost the rights\nof a stranger.’\n\n‘You choose your own associates, Frédéric,’ she said.\n\n‘I am here to speak of it,’ he returned.  ‘It is now four years since we\nwere married; and these four years, Seraphina, have not perhaps been\nhappy either for you or for me.  I am well aware I was unsuitable to be\nyour husband.  I was not young, I had no ambition, I was a trifler; and\nyou despised me, I dare not say unjustly.  But to do justice on both\nsides, you must bear in mind how I have acted.  When I found it amused\nyou to play the part of Princess on this little stage, did I not\nimmediately resign to you my box of toys, this Grünewald?  And when I\nfound I was distasteful as a husband, could any husband have been less\nintrusive?  You will tell me that I have no feelings, no preference, and\nthus no credit; that I go before the wind; that all this was in my\ncharacter.  And indeed, one thing is true, that it is easy, too easy, to\nleave things undone.  But Seraphina, I begin to learn it is not always\nwise.  If I were too old and too uncongenial for your husband, I should\nstill have remembered that I was the Prince of that country to which you\ncame, a visitor and a child.  In that relation also there were duties,\nand these duties I have not performed.’\n\nTo claim the advantage of superior age is to give sure offence.  ‘Duty!’\nlaughed Seraphina, ‘and on your lips, Frédéric!  You make me laugh.  What\nfancy is this?  Go, flirt with the maids and be a prince in Dresden\nchina, as you look.  Enjoy yourself, _mon enfant_, and leave duty and the\nstate to us.’\n\nThe plural grated on the Prince.  ‘I have enjoyed myself too much,’ he\nsaid, ‘since enjoyment is the word.  And yet there were much to say upon\nthe other side.  You must suppose me desperately fond of hunting.  But\nindeed there were days when I found a great deal of interest in what it\nwas courtesy to call my government.  And I have always had some claim to\ntaste; I could tell live happiness from dull routine; and between\nhunting, and the throne of Austria, and your society, my choice had never\nwavered, had the choice been mine.  You were a girl, a bud, when you were\ngiven me—’\n\n‘Heavens!’ she cried, ‘is this to be a love-scene?’\n\n‘I am never ridiculous,’ he said; ‘it is my only merit; and you may be\ncertain this shall be a scene of marriage _à la mode_.  But when I\nremember the beginning, it is bare courtesy to speak in sorrow.  Be just,\nmadam: you would think me strangely uncivil to recall these days without\nthe decency of a regret.  Be yet a little juster, and own, if only in\ncomplaisance, that you yourself regret that past.’\n\n‘I have nothing to regret,’ said the Princess.  ‘You surprise me.  I\nthought you were so happy.’\n\n‘Happy and happy, there are so many hundred ways,’ said Otto.  ‘A man may\nbe happy in revolt; he may be happy in sleep; wine, change, and travel\nmake him happy; virtue, they say, will do the like—I have not tried; and\nthey say also that in old, quiet, and habitual marriages there is yet\nanother happiness.  Happy, yes; I am happy if you like; but I will tell\nyou frankly, I was happier when I brought you home.’\n\n‘Well,’ said the Princess, not without constraint, ‘it seems you changed\nyour mind.’\n\n‘Not I,’ returned Otto, ‘I never changed.  Do you remember, Seraphina, on\nour way home, when you saw the roses in the lane, and I got out and\nplucked them?  It was a narrow lane between great trees; the sunset at\nthe end was all gold, and the rooks were flying overhead.  There were\nnine, nine red roses; you gave me a kiss for each, and I told myself that\nevery rose and every kiss should stand for a year of love.  Well, in\neighteen months there was an end.  But do you fancy, Seraphina, that my\nheart has altered?’\n\n‘I am sure I cannot tell,’ she said, like an automaton.\n\n‘It has not,’ the Prince continued.  ‘There is nothing ridiculous, even\nfrom a husband, in a love that owns itself unhappy and that asks no more.\nI built on sand; pardon me, I do not breathe a reproach—I built, I\nsuppose, upon my own infirmities; but I put my heart in the building, and\nit still lies among the ruins.’\n\n‘How very poetical!’ she said, with a little choking laugh, unknown\nrelentings, unfamiliar softnesses, moving within her.  ‘What would you be\nat?’ she added, hardening her voice.\n\n‘I would be at this,’ he answered; ‘and hard it is to say.  I would be at\nthis:—Seraphina, I am your husband after all, and a poor fool that loves\nyou.  Understand,’ he cried almost fiercely, ‘I am no suppliant husband;\nwhat your love refuses I would scorn to receive from your pity.  I do not\nask, I would not take it.  And for jealousy, what ground have I?  A\ndog-in-the-manger jealousy is a thing the dogs may laugh at.  But at\nleast, in the world’s eye, I am still your husband; and I ask you if you\ntreat me fairly?  I keep to myself, I leave you free, I have given you in\neverything your will.  What do you in return?  I find, Seraphina, that\nyou have been too thoughtless.  But between persons such as we are, in\nour conspicuous station, particular care and a particular courtesy are\nowing.  Scandal is perhaps not easy to avoid; but it is hard to bear.’\n\n‘Scandal!’ she cried, with a deep breath.  ‘Scandal!  It is for this you\nhave been driving!’\n\n‘I have tried to tell you how I feel,’ he replied.  ‘I have told you that\nI love you—love you in vain—a bitter thing for a husband; I have laid\nmyself open that I might speak without offence.  And now that I have\nbegun, I will go on and finish.’\n\n‘I demand it,’ she said.  ‘What is this about?’\n\nOtto flushed crimson.  ‘I have to say what I would fain not,’ he\nanswered.  ‘I counsel you to see less of Gondremark.’\n\n‘Of Gondremark?  And why?’ she asked.\n\n‘Your intimacy is the ground of scandal, madam,’ said Otto, firmly\nenough—‘of a scandal that is agony to me, and would be crushing to your\nparents if they knew it.’\n\n‘You are the first to bring me word of it,’ said she.  ‘I thank you.’\n\n‘You have perhaps cause,’ he replied.  ‘Perhaps I am the only one among\nyour friends—’\n\n‘O, leave my friends alone,’ she interrupted.  ‘My friends are of a\ndifferent stamp.  You have come to me here and made a parade of\nsentiment.  When have I last seen you?  I have governed your kingdom for\nyou in the meanwhile, and there I got no help.  At last, when I am weary\nwith a man’s work, and you are weary of your playthings, you return to\nmake me a scene of conjugal reproaches—the grocer and his wife!  The\npositions are too much reversed; and you should understand, at least,\nthat I cannot at the same time do your work of government and behave\nmyself like a little girl.  Scandal is the atmosphere in which we live,\nwe princes; it is what a prince should know.  You play an odious part.\nDo you believe this rumour?’\n\n‘Madam, should I be here?’ said Otto.\n\n‘It is what I want to know!’ she cried, the tempest of her scorn\nincreasing.  ‘Suppose you did—I say, suppose you did believe it?’\n\n‘I should make it my business to suppose the contrary,’ he answered.\n\n‘I thought so.  O, you are made of baseness!’ said she.\n\n‘Madam,’ he cried, roused at last, ‘enough of this.  You wilfully\nmisunderstand my attitude; you outwear my patience.  In the name of your\nparents, in my own name, I summon you to be more circumspect.’\n\n‘Is this a request, _monsieur mon mari_?’ she demanded.\n\n‘Madam, if I chose, I might command,’ said Otto.\n\n‘You might, sir, as the law stands, make me prisoner,’ returned\nSeraphina.  ‘Short of that you will gain nothing.’\n\n‘You will continue as before?’ he asked.\n\n‘Precisely as before,’ said she.  ‘As soon as this comedy is over, I\nshall request the Freiherr von Gondremark to visit me.  Do you\nunderstand?’ she added, rising.  ‘For my part, I have done.’\n\n‘I will then ask the favour of your hand, madam,’ said Otto, palpitating\nin every pulse with anger.  ‘I have to request that you will visit in my\nsociety another part of my poor house.  And reassure yourself—it will not\ntake long—and it is the last obligation that you shall have the chance to\nlay me under.’\n\n‘The last?’ she cried.  ‘Most joyfully?’\n\nShe offered her hand, and he took it; on each side with an elaborate\naffectation, each inwardly incandescent.  He led her out by the private\ndoor, following where Gondremark had passed; they threaded a corridor or\ntwo, little frequented, looking on a court, until they came at last into\nthe Prince’s suite.  The first room was an armoury, hung all about with\nthe weapons of various countries, and looking forth on the front terrace.\n\n‘Have you brought me here to slay me?’ she inquired.\n\n‘I have brought you, madam, only to pass on,’ replied Otto.\n\nNext they came to a library, where an old chamberlain sat half asleep.\nHe rose and bowed before the princely couple, asking for orders.\n\n‘You will attend us here,’ said Otto.\n\nThe next stage was a gallery of pictures, where Seraphina’s portrait hung\nconspicuous, dressed for the chase, red roses in her hair, as Otto, in\nthe first months of marriage, had directed.  He pointed to it without a\nword; she raised her eyebrows in silence; and they passed still forward\ninto a matted corridor where four doors opened.  One led to Otto’s\nbedroom; one was the private door to Seraphina’s.  And here, for the\nfirst time, Otto left her hand, and stepping forward, shot the bolt.\n\n‘It is long, madam,’ said he, ‘since it was bolted on the other side.’\n\n‘One was effectual,’ returned the Princess.  ‘Is this all?’\n\n‘Shall I reconduct you?’ he asking, bowing.\n\n‘I should prefer,’ she asked, in ringing tones, ‘the conduct of the\nFreiherr von Gondremark.’\n\nOtto summoned the chamberlain.  ‘If the Freiherr von Gondremark is in the\npalace,’ he said, ‘bid him attend the Princess here.’  And when the\nofficial had departed, ‘Can I do more to serve you, madam?’ the Prince\nasked.\n\n‘Thank you, no.  I have been much amused,’ she answered.\n\n‘I have now,’ continued Otto, ‘given you your liberty complete.  This has\nbeen for you a miserable marriage.’\n\n‘Miserable!’ said she.\n\n‘It has been made light to you; it shall be lighter still,’ continued the\nPrince.  ‘But one thing, madam, you must still continue to bear—my\nfather’s name, which is now yours.  I leave it in your hands.  Let me see\nyou, since you will have no advice of mine, apply the more attention of\nyour own to bear it worthily.’\n\n‘Herr von Gondremark is long in coming,’ she remarked.\n\n‘O Seraphina, Seraphina!’ he cried.  And that was the end of their\ninterview.\n\nShe tripped to a window and looked out; and a little after, the\nchamberlain announced the Freiherr von Gondremark, who entered with\nsomething of a wild eye and changed complexion, confounded, as he was, at\nthis unusual summons.  The Princess faced round from the window with a\npearly smile; nothing but her heightened colour spoke of discomposure.\n\nOtto was pale, but he was otherwise master of himself.\n\n‘Herr von Gondremark,’ said he, ‘oblige me so far: reconduct the Princess\nto her own apartment.’\n\nThe Baron, still all at sea, offered his hand, which was smilingly\naccepted, and the pair sailed forth through the picture-gallery.\n\nAs soon as they were gone, and Otto knew the length and breadth of his\nmiscarriage, and how he had done the contrary of all that he intended, he\nstood stupefied.  A fiasco so complete and sweeping was laughable, even\nto himself; and he laughed aloud in his wrath.  Upon this mood there\nfollowed the sharpest violence of remorse; and to that again, as he\nrecalled his provocation, anger succeeded afresh.  So he was tossed in\nspirit; now bewailing his inconsequence and lack of temper, now flaming\nup in white-hot indignation and a noble pity for himself.\n\nHe paced his apartment like a leopard.  There was danger in Otto, for a\nflash.  Like a pistol, he could kill at one moment, and the next he might\nhe kicked aside.  But just then, as he walked the long floors in his\nalternate humours, tearing his handkerchief between his hands, he was\nstrung to his top note, every nerve attent.  The pistol, you might say,\nwas charged.  And when jealousy from time to time fetched him a lash\nacross the tenderest of his feeling, and sent a string of her\nfire-pictures glancing before his mind’s eye, the contraction of his face\nwas even dangerous.  He disregarded jealousy’s inventions, yet they\nstung.  In this height of anger, he still preserved his faith in\nSeraphina’s innocence; but the thought of her possible misconduct was the\nbitterest ingredient in his pot of sorrow.\n\nThere came a knock at the door, and the chamberlain brought him a note.\nHe took it and ground it in his hand, continuing his march, continuing\nhis bewildered thoughts; and some minutes had gone by before the\ncircumstance came clearly to his mind.  Then he paused and opened it.  It\nwas a pencil scratch from Gotthold, thus conceived:\n\n    ‘The council is privately summoned at once.\n\n                                                                 G. v. H.’\n\nIf the council was thus called before the hour, and that privately, it\nwas plain they feared his interference.  Feared: here was a sweet\nthought.  Gotthold, too—Gotthold, who had always used and regarded him as\na mere peasant lad, had now been at the pains to warn him; Gotthold\nlooked for something at his hands.  Well, none should be disappointed;\nthe Prince, too long beshadowed by the uxorious lover, should now return\nand shine.  He summoned his valet, repaired the disorder of his\nappearance with elaborate care; and then, curled and scented and adorned,\nPrince Charming in every line, but with a twitching nostril, he set forth\nunattended for the council.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—THE PRINCE DISSOLVES THE COUNCIL\n\n\nIt was as Gotthold wrote.  The liberation of Sir John, Greisengesang’s\nuneasy narrative, last of all, the scene between Seraphina and the\nPrince, had decided the conspirators to take a step of bold timidity.\nThere had been a period of bustle, liveried messengers speeding here and\nthere with notes; and at half-past ten in the morning, about an hour\nbefore its usual hour, the council of Grünewald sat around the board.\n\nIt was not a large body.  At the instance of Gondremark, it had undergone\na strict purgation, and was now composed exclusively of tools.  Three\nsecretaries sat at a side-table.  Seraphina took the head; on her right\nwas the Baron, on her left Greisengesang; below these Grafinski the\ntreasurer, Count Eisenthal, a couple of non-combatants, and, to the\nsurprise of all, Gotthold.  He had been named a privy councillor by Otto,\nmerely that he might profit by the salary; and as he was never known to\nattend a meeting, it had occurred to nobody to cancel his appointment.\nHis present appearance was the more ominous, coming when it did.\nGondremark scowled upon him; and the non-combatant on his right,\nintercepting this black look, edged away from one who was so clearly out\nof favour.\n\n‘The hour presses, your Highness,’ said the Baron; ‘may we proceed to\nbusiness?’\n\n‘At once,’ replied Seraphina.\n\n‘Your Highness will pardon me,’ said Gotthold; ‘but you are still,\nperhaps, unacquainted with the fact that Prince Otto has returned.’\n\n‘The Prince will not attend the council,’ replied Seraphina, with a\nmomentary blush.  ‘The despatches, Herr Cancellarius?  There is one for\nGerolstein?’\n\nA secretary brought a paper.\n\n‘Here, madam,’ said Greisengesang.  ‘Shall I read it?’\n\n‘We are all familiar with its terms,’ replied Gondremark.  ‘Your Highness\napproves?’\n\n‘Unhesitatingly,’ said Seraphina.\n\n‘It may then be held as read,’ concluded the Baron.  ‘Will your Highness\nsign?’\n\nThe Princess did so; Gondremark, Eisenthal, and one of the non-combatants\nfollowed suit; and the paper was then passed across the table to the\nlibrarian.  He proceeded leisurely to read.\n\n‘We have no time to spare, Herr Doctor,’ cried the Baron brutally.  ‘If\nyou do not choose to sign on the authority of your sovereign, pass it on.\nOr you may leave the table,’ he added, his temper ripping out.\n\n‘I decline your invitation, Herr von Gondremark; and my sovereign, as I\ncontinue to observe with regret, is still absent from the board,’ replied\nthe Doctor calmly; and he resumed the perusal of the paper, the rest\nchafing and exchanging glances.  ‘Madame and gentlemen,’ he said, at\nlast, ‘what I hold in my hand is simply a declaration of war.’\n\n‘Simply,’ said Seraphina, flashing defiance.\n\n‘The sovereign of this country is under the same roof with us,’ continued\nGotthold, ‘and I insist he shall be summoned.  It is needless to adduce\nmy reasons; you are all ashamed at heart of this projected treachery.’\n\nThe council waved like a sea.  There were various outcries.\n\n‘You insult the Princess,’ thundered Gondremark.\n\n‘I maintain my protest,’ replied Gotthold.\n\nAt the height of this confusion the door was thrown open; an usher\nannounced, ‘Gentlemen, the Prince!’ and Otto, with his most excellent\nbearing, entered the apartment.  It was like oil upon the troubled\nwaters; every one settled instantly into his place, and Griesengesang, to\ngive himself a countenance, became absorbed in the arrangement of his\npapers; but in their eagerness to dissemble, one and all neglected to\nrise.\n\n‘Gentlemen,’ said the Prince, pausing.\n\nThey all got to their feet in a moment; and this reproof still further\ndemoralised the weaker brethren.\n\nThe Prince moved slowly towards the lower end of the table; then he\npaused again, and, fixing his eye on Greisengesang, ‘How comes it, Herr\nCancellarius,’ he asked, ‘that I have received no notice of the change of\nhour?’\n\n‘Your Highness,’ replied the Chancellor, ‘her Highness the Princess . . .\n’ and there paused.\n\n‘I understood,’ said Seraphina, taking him up, ‘that you did not purpose\nto be present.’\n\nTheir eyes met for a second, and Seraphina’s fell; but her anger only\nburned the brighter for that private shame.\n\n‘And now, gentlemen,’ said Otto, taking his chair, ‘I pray you to be\nseated.  I have been absent: there are doubtless some arrears; but ere we\nproceed to business, Herr Grafinski, you will direct four thousand crowns\nto be sent to me at once.  Make a note, if you please,’ he added, as the\ntreasurer still stared in wonder.\n\n‘Four thousand crowns?’ asked Seraphina.  ‘Pray, for what?’\n\n‘Madam,’ returned Otto, smiling, ‘for my own purposes.’\n\nGondremark spurred up Grafinski underneath the table.\n\n‘If your Highness will indicate the destination . . . ’ began the puppet.\n\n‘You are not here, sir, to interrogate your Prince,’ said Otto.\n\nGrafinski looked for help to his commander; and Gondremark came to his\naid, in suave and measured tones.\n\n‘Your Highness may reasonably be surprised,’ he said; ‘and Herr\nGrafinski, although I am convinced he is clear of the intention of\noffending, would have perhaps done better to begin with an explanation.\nThe resources of the state are at the present moment entirely swallowed\nup, or, as we hope to prove, wisely invested.  In a month from now, I do\nnot question we shall be able to meet any command your Highness may lay\nupon us; but at this hour I fear that, even in so small a matter, he must\nprepare himself for disappointment.  Our zeal is no less, although our\npower may be inadequate.’\n\n‘How much, Herr Grafinski, have we in the treasury?’ asked Otto.\n\n‘Your Highness,’ protested the treasurer, ‘we have immediate need of\nevery crown.’\n\n‘I think, sir, you evade me,’ flashed the Prince; and then turning to the\nside-table, ‘Mr. Secretary,’ he added, ‘bring me, if you please, the\ntreasury docket.’\n\nHerr Grafinski became deadly pale; the Chancellor, expecting his own\nturn, was probably engaged in prayer; Gondremark was watching like a\nponderous cat.  Gotthold, on his part, looked on with wonder at his\ncousin; he was certainly showing spirit, but what, in such a time of\ngravity, was all this talk of money? and why should he waste his strength\nupon a personal issue?\n\n‘I find,’ said Otto, with his finger on the docket, ‘that we have 20,000\ncrowns in case.’\n\n‘That is exact, your Highness,’ replied the Baron.  ‘But our liabilities,\nall of which are happily not liquid, amount to a far larger sum; and at\nthe present point of time it would be morally impossible to divert a\nsingle florin.  Essentially, the case is empty.  We have, already\npresented, a large note for material of war.’\n\n‘Material of war?’ exclaimed Otto, with an excellent assumption of\nsurprise.  ‘But if my memory serves me right, we settled these accounts\nin January.’\n\n‘There have been further orders,’ the Baron explained.  ‘A new park of\nartillery has been completed; five hundred stand of arms, seven hundred\nbaggage mules—the details are in a special memorandum.—Mr. Secretary\nHoltz, the memorandum, if you please.’\n\n‘One would think, gentlemen, that we were going to war,’ said Otto.\n\n‘We are,’ said Seraphina.\n\n‘War!’ cried the Prince, ‘and, gentlemen, with whom?  The peace of\nGrünewald has endured for centuries.  What aggression, what insult, have\nwe suffered?’\n\n‘Here, your Highness,’ said Gotthold, ‘is the ultimatum.  It was in the\nvery article of signature, when your Highness so opportunely entered.’\n\nOtto laid the paper before him; as he read, his fingers played tattoo\nupon the table.  ‘Was it proposed,’ he inquired, ‘to send this paper\nforth without a knowledge of my pleasure?’\n\nOne of the non-combatants, eager to trim, volunteered an answer.  ‘The\nHerr Doctor von Hohenstockwitz had just entered his dissent,’ he added.\n\n‘Give me the rest of this correspondence,’ said the Prince.  It was\nhanded to him, and he read it patiently from end to end, while the\ncouncillors sat foolishly enough looking before them on the table.\n\nThe secretaries, in the background, were exchanging glances of delight; a\nrow at the council was for them a rare and welcome feature.\n\n‘Gentlemen,’ said Otto, when he had finished, ‘I have read with pain.\nThis claim upon Obermünsterol is palpably unjust; it has not a tincture,\nnot a show, of justice.  There is not in all this ground enough for\nafter-dinner talk, and you propose to force it as a _casus belli_.’\n\n‘Certainly, your Highness,’ returned Gondremark, too wise to defend the\nindefensible, ‘the claim on Obermünsterol is simply a pretext.’\n\n‘It is well,’ said the Prince.  ‘Herr Cancellarius, take your pen.  “The\ncouncil,” he began to dictate—‘I withhold all notice of my intervention,’\nhe said, in parenthesis, and addressing himself more directly to his\nwife; ‘and I say nothing of the strange suppression by which this\nbusiness has been smuggled past my knowledge.  I am content to be in\ntime—“The council,”’ he resumed, ‘“on a further examination of the facts,\nand enlightened by the note in the last despatch from Gerolstein, have\nthe pleasure to announce that they are entirely at one, both as to fact\nand sentiment, with the Grand-Ducal Court of Gerolstein.”  You have it?\nUpon these lines, sir, you will draw up the despatch.’\n\n‘If your Highness will allow me,’ said the Baron, ‘your Highness is so\nimperfectly acquainted with the internal history of this correspondence,\nthat any interference will be merely hurtful.  Such a paper as your\nHighness proposes would be to stultify the whole previous policy of\nGrünewald.’\n\n‘The policy of Grünewald!’ cried the Prince.  ‘One would suppose you had\nno sense of humour!  Would you fish in a coffee cup?’\n\n‘With deference, your Highness,’ returned the Baron, ‘even in a coffee\ncup there may be poison.  The purpose of this war is not simply\nterritorial enlargement; still less is it a war of glory; for, as your\nHighness indicates, the state of Grünewald is too small to be ambitious.\nBut the body politic is seriously diseased; republicanism, socialism,\nmany disintegrating ideas are abroad; circle within circle, a really\nformidable organisation has grown up about your Highness’s throne.’\n\n‘I have heard of it, Herr von Gondremark,’ put in the Prince; ‘but I have\nreason to be aware that yours is the more authoritative information.’\n\n‘I am honoured by this expression of my Prince’s confidence’ returned\nGondremark, unabashed.  ‘It is, therefore, with a single eye to these\ndisorders that our present external policy has been shaped.  Something\nwas required to divert public attention, to employ the idle, to\npopularise your Highness’s rule, and, if it were possible, to enable him\nto reduce the taxes at a blow and to a notable amount.  The proposed\nexpedition—for it cannot without hyperbole be called a war—seemed to the\ncouncil to combine the various characters required; a marked improvement\nin the public sentiment has followed even upon our preparations; and I\ncannot doubt that when success shall follow, the effect will surpass even\nour boldest hopes.’\n\n‘You are very adroit, Herr von Gondremark,’ said Otto.  ‘You fill me with\nadmiration.  I had not heretofore done justice to your qualities.’\n\nSeraphina looked up with joy, supposing Otto conquered; but Gondremark\nstill waited, armed at every point; he knew how very stubborn is the\nrevolt of a weak character.\n\n‘And the territorial army scheme, to which I was persuaded to consent—was\nit secretly directed to the same end?’ the Prince asked.\n\n‘I still believe the effect to have been good,’ replied the Baron;\n‘discipline and mounting guard are excellent sedatives.  But I will avow\nto your Highness, I was unaware, at the date of that decree, of the\nmagnitude of the revolutionary movement; nor did any of us, I think,\nimagine that such a territorial army was a part of the republican\nproposals.’\n\n‘It was?’ asked Otto.  ‘Strange!  Upon what fancied grounds?’\n\n‘The grounds were indeed fanciful,’ returned the Baron.  ‘It was\nconceived among the leaders that a territorial army, drawn from and\nreturning to the people, would, in the event of any popular uprising,\nprove lukewarm or unfaithful to the throne.’\n\n‘I see,’ said the Prince.  ‘I begin to understand.’\n\n‘His Highness begins to understand?’ repeated Gondremark, with the\nsweetest politeness.  ‘May I beg of him to complete the phrase?’\n\n‘The history of the revolution,’ replied Otto dryly.  ‘And now,’ he\nadded, ‘what do you conclude?’\n\n‘I conclude, your Highness, with a simple reflection,’ said the Baron,\naccepting the stab without a quiver, ‘the war is popular; were the rumour\ncontradicted to-morrow, a considerable disappointment would be felt in\nmany classes; and in the present tension of spirits, the most lukewarm\nsentiment may be enough to precipitate events.  There lies the danger.\nThe revolution hangs imminent; we sit, at this council board, below the\nsword of Damocles.’\n\n‘We must then lay our heads together,’ said the Prince, ‘and devise some\nhonourable means of safety.’\n\nUp to this moment, since the first note of opposition fell from the\nlibrarian, Seraphina had uttered about twenty words.  With a somewhat\nheightened colour, her eyes generally lowered, her foot sometimes\nnervously tapping on the floor, she had kept her own counsel and\ncommanded her anger like a hero.  But at this stage of the engagement she\nlost control of her impatience.\n\n‘Means!’ she cried.  ‘They have been found and prepared before you knew\nthe need for them.  Sign the despatch, and let us be done with this\ndelay.’\n\n‘Madam, I said “honourable,”’ returned Otto, bowing.  ‘This war is, in my\neyes, and by Herr von Gondremark’s account, an inadmissible expedient.\nIf we have misgoverned here in Grünewald, are the people of Gerolstein to\nbleed and pay for our mis-doings?  Never, madam; not while I live.  But I\nattach so much importance to all that I have heard to-day for the first\ntime—and why only to-day, I do not even stop to ask—that I am eager to\nfind some plan that I can follow with credit to myself.’\n\n‘And should you fail?’ she asked.\n\n‘Should I fail, I will then meet the blow half-way,’ replied the Prince.\n‘On the first open discontent, I shall convoke the States, and, when it\npleases them to bid me, abdicate.’\n\nSeraphina laughed angrily.  ‘This is the man for whom we have been\nlabouring!’ she cried.  ‘We tell him of change; he will devise the means,\nhe says; and his device is abdication?  Sir, have you no shame to come\nhere at the eleventh hour among those who have borne the heat and burthen\nof the day?  Do you not wonder at yourself?  I, sir, was here in my\nplace, striving to uphold your dignity alone.  I took counsel with the\nwisest I could find, while you were eating and hunting.  I have laid my\nplans with foresight; they were ripe for action; and then—‘she\nchoked—‘then you return—for a forenoon—to ruin all!  To-morrow, you will\nbe once more about your pleasures; you will give us leave once more to\nthink and work for you; and again you will come back, and again you will\nthwart what you had not the industry or knowledge to conceive.  O! it is\nintolerable.  Be modest, sir.  Do not presume upon the rank you cannot\nworthily uphold.  I would not issue my commands with so much gusto—it is\nfrom no merit in yourself they are obeyed.  What are you?  What have you\nto do in this grave council?  Go,’ she cried, ‘go among your equals?  The\nvery people in the streets mock at you for a prince.’\n\nAt this surprising outburst the whole council sat aghast.\n\n‘Madam,’ said the Baron, alarmed out of his caution, ‘command yourself.’\n\n‘Address yourself to me, sir!’ cried the Prince.  ‘I will not bear these\nwhisperings!’\n\nSeraphina burst into tears.\n\n‘Sir,’ cried the Baron, rising, ‘this lady—’\n\n‘Herr von Gondremark,’ said the Prince, ‘one more observation, and I\nplace you under arrest.’\n\n‘Your Highness is the master,’ replied Gondremark, bowing.\n\n‘Bear it in mind more constantly,’ said Otto.  ‘Herr Cancellarius, bring\nall the papers to my cabinet.  Gentlemen, the council is dissolved.’\n\nAnd he bowed and left the apartment, followed by Greisengesang and the\nsecretaries, just at the moment when the Princess’s ladies, summoned in\nall haste, entered by another door to help her forth.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—THE PARTY OF WAR TAKES ACTION\n\n\nHalf an hour after, Gondremark was once more closeted with Seraphina.\n\n‘Where is he now?’ she asked, on his arrival.\n\n‘Madam, he is with the Chancellor,’ replied the Baron.  ‘Wonder of\nwonders, he is at work!’\n\n‘Ah,’ she said, ‘he was born to torture me!  O what a fall, what a\nhumiliation!  Such a scheme to wreck upon so small a trifle!  But now all\nis lost.’\n\n‘Madam,’ said Gondremark, ‘nothing is lost.  Something, on the other\nhand, is found.  You have found your senses; you see him as he is—see him\nas you see everything where your too-good heart is not in question—with\nthe judicial, with the statesman’s eye.  So long as he had a right to\ninterfere, the empire that may be was still distant.  I have not entered\non this course without the plain foresight of its dangers; and even for\nthis I was prepared.  But, madam, I knew two things: I knew that you were\nborn to command, that I was born to serve; I knew that by a rare\nconjuncture, the hand had found the tool; and from the first I was\nconfident, as I am confident to-day, that no hereditary trifler has the\npower to shatter that alliance.’\n\n‘I, born to command!’ she said.  ‘Do you forget my tears?’\n\n‘Madam, they were the tears of Alexander,’ cried the Baron.  ‘They\ntouched, they thrilled me; I, forgot myself a moment—even I!  But do you\nsuppose that I had not remarked, that I had not admired, your previous\nbearing? your great self-command?  Ay, that was princely!’  He paused.\n‘It was a thing to see.  I drank confidence!  I tried to imitate your\ncalm.  And I was well inspired; in my heart, I think that I was well\ninspired; that any man, within the reach of argument, had been convinced!\nBut it was not to be; nor, madam, do I regret the failure.  Let us be\nopen; let me disclose my heart.  I have loved two things, not unworthily:\nGrünewald and my sovereign!’  Here he kissed her hand.  ‘Either I must\nresign my ministry, leave the land of my adoption and the queen whom I\nhad chosen to obey—or—’  He paused again.\n\n‘Alas, Herr von Gondremark, there is no “or,”’ said Seraphina.\n\n‘Nay, madam, give me time,’ he replied.  ‘When first I saw you, you were\nstill young; not every man would have remarked your powers; but I had not\nbeen twice honoured by your conversation ere I had found my mistress.  I\nhave, madam, I believe, some genius; and I have much ambition.  But the\ngenius is of the serving kind; and to offer a career to my ambition, I\nhad to find one born to rule.  This is the base and essence of our union;\neach had need of the other; each recognised, master and servant, lever\nand fulcrum, the complement of his endowment.  Marriages, they say, are\nmade in heaven: how much more these pure, laborious, intellectual\nfellowships, born to found empires!  Nor is this all.  We found each\nother ripe, filled with great ideas that took shape and clarified with\nevery word.  We grew together—ay, madam, in mind we grew together like\ntwin children.  All of my life until we met was petty and groping; was it\nnot—I will flatter myself openly—it _was_ the same with you!  Not till\nthen had you those eagle surveys, that wide and hopeful sweep of\nintuition!  Thus we had formed ourselves, and we were ready.’\n\n‘It is true,’ she cried.  ‘I feel it.  Yours is the genius; your\ngenerosity confounds your insight; all I could offer you was the\nposition, was this throne, to be a fulcrum.  But I offered it without\nreserve; I entered at least warmly into all your thoughts; you were sure\nof me—sure of my support—certain of justice.  Tell me, tell me again,\nthat I have helped you.’\n\n‘Nay, madam,’ he said, ‘you made me.  In everything you were my\ninspiration.  And as we prepared our policy, weighing every step, how\noften have I had to admire your perspicacity, your man-like diligence and\nfortitude!  You know that these are not the words of flattery; your\nconscience echoes them; have you spared a day? have you indulged yourself\nin any pleasure?  Young and beautiful, you have lived a life of high\nintellectual effort, of irksome intellectual patience with details.\nWell, you have your reward: with the fall of Brandenau, the throne of\nyour Empire is founded.’\n\n‘What thought have you in your mind?’ she asked.  ‘Is not all ruined?’\n\n‘Nay, my Princess, the same thought is in both our minds,’ he said.\n\n‘Herr von Gondremark,’ she replied, ‘by all that I hold sacred, I have\nnone; I do not think at all; I am crushed.’\n\n‘You are looking at the passionate side of a rich nature, misunderstood\nand recently insulted,’ said the Baron.  ‘Look into your intellect, and\ntell me.’\n\n‘I find nothing, nothing but tumult,’ she replied.\n\n‘You find one word branded, madam,’ returned the Baron: ‘“Abdication!”’\n\n‘O!’ she cried.  ‘The coward!  He leaves me to bear all, and in the hour\nof trial he stabs me from behind.  There is nothing in him, not respect,\nnot love, not courage—his wife, his dignity, his throne, the honour of\nhis father, he forgets them all!’\n\n‘Yes,’ pursued the Baron, ‘the word Abdication.  I perceive a glimmering\nthere.’\n\n‘I read your fancy,’ she returned.  ‘It is mere madness, midsummer\nmadness.  Baron, I am more unpopular than he.  You know it.  They can\nexcuse, they can love, his weakness; but me, they hate.’\n\n‘Such is the gratitude of peoples,’ said the Baron.  ‘But we trifle.\nHere, madam, are my plain thoughts.  The man who in the hour of danger\nspeaks of abdication is, for me, a venomous animal.  I speak with the\nbluntness of gravity, madam; this is no hour for mincing.  The coward, in\na station of authority, is more dangerous than fire.  We dwell on a\nvolcano; if this man can have his way, Grünewald before a week will have\nbeen deluged with innocent blood.  You know the truth of what I say; we\nhave looked unblenching into this ever-possible catastrophe.  To him it\nis nothing: he will abdicate!  Abdicate, just God! and this unhappy\ncountry committed to his charge, and the lives of men and the honour of\nwomen . . .’  His voice appeared to fail him; in an instant he had\nconquered his emotion and resumed: ‘But you, madam, conceive more\nworthily of your responsibilities.  I am with you in the thought; and in\nthe face of the horrors that I see impending, I say, and your heart\nrepeats it—we have gone too far to pause.  Honour, duty, ay, and the care\nof our own lives, demand we should proceed.’\n\nShe was looking at him, her brow thoughtfully knitted.  ‘I feel it,’ she\nsaid.  ‘But how?  He has the power.’\n\n‘The power, madam?  The power is in the army,’ he replied; and then\nhastily, ere she could intervene, ‘we have to save ourselves,’ he went\non; ‘I have to save my Princess, she has to save her minister; we have\nboth of us to save this infatuated youth from his own madness.  He in the\noutbreak would be the earliest victim; I see him,’ he cried, ‘torn in\npieces; and Grünewald, unhappy Grünewald!  Nay, madam, you who have the\npower must use it; it lies hard upon your conscience.’\n\n‘Show me how!’ she cried.  ‘Suppose I were to place him under some\nconstraint, the revolution would break upon us instantly.’\n\nThe Baron feigned defeat.  ‘It is true,’ he said.  ‘You see more clearly\nthan I do.  Yet there should, there must be, some way.’  And he waited\nfor his chance.\n\n‘No,’ she said; ‘I told you from the first there is no remedy.  Our hopes\nare lost: lost by one miserable trifler, ignorant, fretful, fitful—who\nwill have disappeared to-morrow, who knows? to his boorish pleasures!’\n\nAny peg would do for Gondremark.  ‘The thing!’ he cried, striking his\nbrow.  ‘Fool, not to have thought of it!  Madam, without perhaps knowing\nit, you have solved our problem.’\n\n‘What do you mean?  Speak!’ she said.\n\nHe appeared to collect himself; and then, with a smile, ‘The Prince,’ he\nsaid, ‘must go once more a-hunting.’\n\n‘Ay, if he would!’ cried she, ‘and stay there!’\n\n‘And stay there,’ echoed the Baron.  It was so significantly said, that\nher face changed; and the schemer, fearful of the sinister ambiguity of\nhis expressions, hastened to explain.  ‘This time he shall go hunting in\na carriage, with a good escort of our foreign lancers.  His destination\nshall be the Felsenburg; it is healthy, the rock is high, the windows are\nsmall and barred; it might have been built on purpose.  We shall intrust\nthe captaincy to the Scotsman Gordon; he at least will have no scruple.\nWho will miss the sovereign?  He is gone hunting; he came home on\nTuesday, on Thursday he returned; all is usual in that.  Meanwhile the\nwar proceeds; our Prince will soon weary of his solitude; and about the\ntime of our triumph, or, if he prove very obstinate, a little later, he\nshall be released upon a proper understanding, and I see him once more\ndirecting his theatricals.’\n\nSeraphina sat gloomy, plunged in thought.  ‘Yes,’ she said suddenly, ‘and\nthe despatch?  He is now writing it.’\n\n‘It cannot pass the council before Friday,’ replied Gondremark; ‘and as\nfor any private note, the messengers are all at my disposal.  They are\npicked men, madam.  I am a person of precaution.’\n\n‘It would appear so,’ she said, with a flash of her occasional repugnance\nto the man; and then after a pause, ‘Herr von Gondremark,’ she added, ‘I\nrecoil from this extremity.’\n\n‘I share your Highness’s repugnance,’ answered he.  ‘But what would you\nhave?  We are defenceless, else.’\n\n‘I see it, but this is sudden.  It is a public crime,’ she said, nodding\nat him with a sort of horror.\n\n‘Look but a little deeper,’ he returned, ‘and whose is the crime?’\n\n‘His!’ she cried.  ‘His, before God!  And I hold him liable.  But still—’\n\n‘It is not as if he would be harmed,’ submitted Gondremark.\n\n‘I know it,’ she replied, but it was still unheartily.\n\nAnd then, as brave men are entitled, by prescriptive right as old as the\nworld’s history, to the alliance and the active help of Fortune, the\npunctual goddess stepped down from the machine.  One of the Princess’s\nladies begged to enter; a man, it appeared, had brought a line for the\nFreiherr von Gondremark.  It proved to be a pencil billet, which the\ncrafty Greisengesang had found the means to scribble and despatch under\nthe very guns of Otto; and the daring of the act bore testimony to the\nterror of the actor.  For Greisengesang had but one influential motive:\nfear.  The note ran thus: ‘At the first council, procuration to be\nwithdrawn.—CORN. GREIS.’\n\nSo, after three years of exercise, the right of signature was to be\nstript from Seraphina.  It was more than an insult; it was a public\ndisgrace; and she did not pause to consider how she had earned it, but\nmorally bounded under the attack as bounds the wounded tiger.\n\n‘Enough,’ she said; ‘I will sign the order.  When shall he leave?’\n\n‘It will take me twelve hours to collect my men, and it had best be done\nat night.  To-morrow midnight, if you please?’ answered the Baron.\n\n‘Excellent,’ she said.  ‘My door is always open to you, Baron.  As soon\nas the order is prepared, bring it me to sign.’\n\n‘Madam,’ he said, ‘alone of all of us you do not risk your head in this\nadventure.  For that reason, and to prevent all hesitation, I venture to\npropose the order should be in your hand throughout.’\n\n‘You are right,’ she replied.\n\nHe laid a form before her, and she wrote the order in a clear hand, and\nre-read it.  Suddenly a cruel smile came on her face.  ‘I had forgotten\nhis puppet,’ said she.  ‘They will keep each other company.’  And she\ninterlined and initiated the condemnation of Doctor Gotthold.\n\n‘Your Highness has more memory than your servant,’ said the Baron; and\nthen he, in his turn, carefully perused the fateful paper.  ‘Good!’ said\nhe.\n\n‘You will appear in the drawing-room, Baron?’ she asked.\n\n‘I thought it better,’ said he, ‘to avoid the possibility of a public\naffront.  Anything that shook my credit might hamper us in the immediate\nfuture.’\n\n‘You are right,’ she said; and she held out her hand as to an old friend\nand equal.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—THE PRICE OF THE RIVER FARM; IN WHICH VAINGLORY GOES BEFORE A\nFALL\n\n\nThe pistol had been practically fired.  Under ordinary circumstances the\nscene at the council table would have entirely exhausted Otto’s store\nboth of energy and anger; he would have begun to examine and condemn his\nconduct, have remembered all that was true, forgotten all that was unjust\nin Seraphina’s onslaught; and by half an hour after would have fallen\ninto that state of mind in which a Catholic flees to the confessional and\na sot takes refuge with the bottle.  Two matters of detail preserved his\nspirits.  For, first, he had still an infinity of business to transact;\nand to transact business, for a man of Otto’s neglectful and\nprocrastinating habits, is the best anodyne for conscience.  All\nafternoon he was hard at it with the Chancellor, reading, dictating,\nsigning, and despatching papers; and this kept him in a glow of\nself-approval.  But, secondly, his vanity was still alarmed; he had\nfailed to get the money; to-morrow before noon he would have to\ndisappoint old Killian; and in the eyes of that family which counted him\nso little, and to which he had sought to play the part of the heroic\ncomforter, he must sink lower than at first.  To a man of Otto’s temper,\nthis was death.  He could not accept the situation.  And even as he\nworked, and worked wisely and well, over the hated details of his\nprincipality, he was secretly maturing a plan by which to turn the\nsituation.  It was a scheme as pleasing to the man as it was\ndishonourable in the prince; in which his frivolous nature found and took\nvengeance for the gravity and burthen of the afternoon.  He chuckled as\nhe thought of it: and Greisengesang heard him with wonder, and attributed\nhis lively spirits to the skirmish of the morning.\n\nLed by this idea, the antique courtier ventured to compliment his\nsovereign on his bearing.  It reminded him, he said, of Otto’s father.\n\n‘What?’ asked the Prince, whose thoughts were miles away.\n\n‘Your Highness’s authority at the board,’ explained the flatterer.\n\n‘O, that!  O yes,’ returned Otto; but for all his carelessness, his\nvanity was delicately tickled, and his mind returned and dwelt\napprovingly over the details of his victory.  ‘I quelled them all,’ he\nthought.\n\nWhen the more pressing matters had been dismissed, it was already late,\nand Otto kept the Chancellor to dinner, and was entertained with a leash\nof ancient histories and modern compliments.  The Chancellor’s career had\nbeen based, from the first off-put, on entire subserviency; he had\ncrawled into honours and employments; and his mind was prostitute.  The\ninstinct of the creature served him well with Otto.  First, he let fall a\nsneering word or two upon the female intellect; thence he proceeded to a\ncloser engagement; and before the third course he was artfully dissecting\nSeraphina’s character to her approving husband.  Of course no names were\nused; and of course the identity of that abstract or ideal man, with whom\nshe was currently contrasted, remained an open secret.  But this stiff\nold gentleman had a wonderful instinct for evil, thus to wind his way\ninto man’s citadel; thus to harp by the hour on the virtues of his hearer\nand not once alarm his self-respect.  Otto was all roseate, in and out,\nwith flattery and Tokay and an approving conscience.  He saw himself in\nthe most attractive colours.  If even Greisengesang, he thought, could\nthus espy the loose stitches in Seraphina’s character, and thus\ndisloyally impart them to the opposite camp, he, the discarded\nhusband—the dispossessed Prince—could scarce have erred on the side of\nseverity.\n\nIn this excellent frame he bade adieu to the old gentleman, whose voice\nhad proved so musical, and set forth for the drawing-room.  Already on\nthe stair, he was seized with some compunction; but when he entered the\ngreat gallery and beheld his wife, the Chancellor’s abstract flatteries\nfell from him like rain, and he re-awoke to the poetic facts of life.\nShe stood a good way off below a shining lustre, her back turned.  The\nbend of her waist overcame him with physical weakness.  This was the\ngirl-wife who had lain in his arms and whom he had sworn to cherish;\nthere was she, who was better than success.\n\nIt was Seraphina who restored him from the blow.  She swam forward and\nsmiled upon her husband with a sweetness that was insultingly artificial.\n‘Frédéric,’ she lisped, ‘you are late.’  It was a scene of high comedy,\nsuch as is proper to unhappy marriages; and her _aplomb_ disgusted him.\n\nThere was no etiquette at these small drawing-rooms.  People came and\nwent at pleasure.  The window embrasures became the roost of happy\ncouples; at the great chimney the talkers mostly congregated, each\nfull-charged with scandal; and down at the farther end the gamblers\ngambled.  It was towards this point that Otto moved, not ostentatiously,\nbut with a gentle insistence, and scattering attentions as he went.  Once\nabreast of the card-table, he placed himself opposite to Madame von\nRosen, and, as soon as he had caught her eye, withdrew to the embrasure\nof a window.  There she had speedily joined him.\n\n‘You did well to call me,’ she said, a little wildly.  ‘These cards will\nbe my ruin.’\n\n‘Leave them,’ said Otto.\n\n‘I!’ she cried, and laughed; ‘they are my destiny.  My only chance was to\ndie of a consumption; now I must die in a garret.’\n\n‘You are bitter to-night,’ said Otto.\n\n‘I have been losing,’ she replied.  ‘You do not know what greed is.’\n\n‘I have come, then, in an evil hour,’ said he.\n\n‘Ah, you wish a favour!’ she cried, brightening beautifully.\n\n‘Madam,’ said he, ‘I am about to found my party, and I come to you for a\nrecruit.’\n\n‘Done,’ said the Countess.  ‘I am a man again.’\n\n‘I may be wrong,’ continued Otto, ‘but I believe upon my heart you wish\nme no ill.’\n\n‘I wish you so well,’ she said, ‘that I dare not tell it you.’\n\n‘Then if I ask my favour?’ quoth the Prince.\n\n‘Ask it, _mon Prince_,’ she answered.  ‘Whatever it is, it is granted.’\n\n‘I wish you,’ he returned, ‘this very night to make the farmer of our\ntalk.’\n\n‘Heaven knows your meaning!’ she exclaimed.  ‘I know not, neither care;\nthere are no bounds to my desire to please you.  Call him made.’\n\n‘I will put it in another way,’ returned Otto.  ‘Did you ever steal?’\n\n‘Often!’ cried the Countess.  ‘I have broken all the ten commandments;\nand if there were more to-morrow, I should not sleep till I had broken\nthese.’\n\n‘This is a case of burglary: to say the truth, I thought it would amuse\nyou,’ said the Prince.\n\n‘I have no practical experience,’ she replied, ‘but O! the good-will!  I\nhave broken a work-box in my time, and several hearts, my own included.\nNever a house!  But it cannot be difficult; sins are so unromantically\neasy!  What are we to break?’\n\n‘Madam, we are to break the treasury,’ said Otto and he sketched to her\nbriefly, wittily, with here and there a touch of pathos, the story of his\nvisit to the farm, of his promise to buy it, and of the refusal with\nwhich his demand for money had been met that morning at the council;\nconcluding with a few practical words as to the treasury windows, and the\nhelps and hindrances of the proposed exploit.\n\n‘They refused you the money,’ she said when he had done.  ‘And you\naccepted the refusal?  Well!’\n\n‘They gave their reasons,’ replied Otto, colouring.  ‘They were not such\nas I could combat; and I am driven to dilapidate the funds of my own\ncountry by a theft.  It is not dignified; but it is fun.’\n\n‘Fun,’ she said; ‘yes.’  And then she remained silently plunged in\nthought for an appreciable time.  ‘How much do you require?’ she asked at\nlength.\n\n‘Three thousand crowns will do,’ he answered, ‘for I have still some\nmoney of my own.’\n\n‘Excellent,’ she said, regaining her levity.  ‘I am your true accomplice.\nAnd where are we to meet?’\n\n‘You know the Flying Mercury,’ he answered, ‘in the Park?  Three pathways\nintersect; there they have made a seat and raised the statue.  The spot\nis handy and the deity congenial.’\n\n‘Child,’ she said, and tapped him with her fan.  ‘But do you know, my\nPrince, you are an egoist—your handy trysting-place is miles from me.\nYou must give me ample time; I cannot, I think, possibly be there before\ntwo.  But as the bell beats two, your helper shall arrive: welcome, I\ntrust.  Stay—do you bring any one?’ she added.  ‘O, it is not for a\nchaperon—I am not a prude!’\n\n‘I shall bring a groom of mine,’ said Otto.  ‘I caught him stealing\ncorn.’\n\n‘His name?’ she asked.\n\n‘I profess I know not.  I am not yet intimate with my corn-stealer,’\nreturned the Prince.  ‘It was in a professional capacity—’\n\n‘Like me!  Flatterer!’ she cried.  ‘But oblige me in one thing.  Let me\nfind you waiting at the seat—yes, you shall await me; for on this\nexpedition it shall be no longer Prince and Countess, it shall be the\nlady and the squire—and your friend the thief shall be no nearer than the\nfountain.  Do you promise?’\n\n‘Madam, in everything you are to command; you shall be captain, I am but\nsupercargo,’ answered Otto.\n\n‘Well, Heaven bring all safe to port!’ she said.  ‘It is not Friday!’\n\nSomething in her manner had puzzled Otto, had possibly touched him with\nsuspicion.\n\n‘Is it not strange,’ he remarked, ‘that I should choose my accomplice\nfrom the other camp?’\n\n‘Fool!’ she said.  ‘But it is your only wisdom that you know your\nfriends.’  And suddenly, in the vantage of the deep window, she caught up\nhis hand and kissed it with a sort of passion.  ‘Now go,’ she added, ‘go\nat once.’\n\nHe went, somewhat staggered, doubting in his heart that he was over-bold.\nFor in that moment she had flashed upon him like a jewel; and even\nthrough the strong panoply of a previous love he had been conscious of a\nshock.  Next moment he had dismissed the fear.\n\nBoth Otto and the Countess retired early from the drawing-room; and the\nPrince, after an elaborate feint, dismissed his valet, and went forth by\nthe private passage and the back postern in quest of the groom.\n\nOnce more the stable was in darkness, once more Otto employed the\ntalismanic knock, and once more the groom appeared and sickened with\nterror.\n\n‘Good-evening, friend,’ said Otto pleasantly.  ‘I want you to bring a\ncorn sack—empty this time—and to accompany me.  We shall be gone all\nnight.’\n\n‘Your Highness,’ groaned the man, ‘I have the charge of the small\nstables.  I am here alone.’\n\n‘Come,’ said the Prince, ‘you are no such martinet in duty.’  And then\nseeing that the man was shaking from head to foot, Otto laid a hand upon\nhis shoulder.  ‘If I meant you harm,’ he said, ‘should I be here?’\n\nThe fellow became instantly reassured.  He got the sack; and Otto led him\nround by several paths and avenues, conversing pleasantly by the way, and\nleft him at last planted by a certain fountain where a goggle-eyed Triton\nspouted intermittently into a rippling laver.  Thence he proceeded alone\nto where, in a round clearing, a copy of Gian Bologna’s Mercury stood\ntiptoe in the twilight of the stars.  The night was warm and windless.  A\nshaving of new moon had lately arisen; but it was still too small and too\nlow down in heaven to contend with the immense host of lesser luminaries;\nand the rough face of the earth was drenched with starlight.  Down one of\nthe alleys, which widened as it receded, he could see a part of the\nlamplit terrace where a sentry silently paced, and beyond that a corner\nof the town with interlacing street-lights.  But all around him the young\ntrees stood mystically blurred in the dim shine; and in the stock-still\nquietness the upleaping god appeared alive.\n\nIn this dimness and silence of the night, Otto’s conscience became\nsuddenly and staringly luminous, like the dial of a city clock.  He\naverted the eyes of his mind, but the finger rapidly travelling, pointed\nto a series of misdeeds that took his breath away.  What was he doing in\nthat place?  The money had been wrongly squandered, but that was largely\nby his own neglect.  And he now proposed to embarrass the finances of\nthis country which he had been too idle to govern.  And he now proposed\nto squander the money once again, and this time for a private, if a\ngenerous end.  And the man whom he had reproved for stealing corn he was\nnow to set stealing treasure.  And then there was Madame von Rosen, upon\nwhom he looked down with some of that ill-favoured contempt of the chaste\nmale for the imperfect woman.  Because he thought of her as one degraded\nbelow scruples, he had picked her out to be still more degraded, and to\nrisk her whole irregular establishment in life by complicity in this\ndishonourable act.  It was uglier than a seduction.\n\nOtto had to walk very briskly and whistle very busily; and when at last\nhe heard steps in the narrowest and darkest of the alleys, it was with a\ngush of relief that he sprang to meet the Countess.  To wrestle alone\nwith one’s good angel is so hard! and so precious, at the proper time, is\na companion certain to be less virtuous than oneself!\n\nIt was a young man who came towards him—a young man of small stature and\na peculiar gait, wearing a wide flapping hat, and carrying, with great\nweariness, a heavy bag.  Otto recoiled; but the young man held up his\nhand by way of signal, and coming up with a panting run, as if with the\nlast of his endurance, laid the bag upon the ground, threw himself upon\nthe bench, and disclosed the features of Madame von Rosen.\n\n‘You, Countess!’ cried the Prince.\n\n‘No, no,’ she panted, ‘the Count von Rosen—my young brother.  A capital\nfellow.  Let him get his breath.’\n\n‘Ah, madam . . . ’ said he.\n\n‘Call me Count,’ she returned, ‘respect my incognito.’\n\n‘Count be it, then,’ he replied.  ‘And let me implore that gallant\ngentleman to set forth at once on our enterprise.’\n\n‘Sit down beside me here,’ she returned, patting the further corner of\nthe bench.  ‘I will follow you in a moment.  O, I am so tired—feel how my\nheart leaps!  Where is your thief?’\n\n‘At his post,’ replied Otto.  ‘Shall I introduce him?  He seems an\nexcellent companion.’\n\n‘No,’ she said, ‘do not hurry me yet.  I must speak to you.  Not but I\nadore your thief; I adore any one who has the spirit to do wrong.  I\nnever cared for virtue till I fell in love with my Prince.’  She laughed\nmusically.  ‘And even so, it is not for your virtues,’ she added.\n\nOtto was embarrassed.  ‘And now,’ he asked, ‘if you are anyway rested?’\n\n‘Presently, presently.  Let me breathe,’ she said, panting a little\nharder than before.\n\n‘And what has so wearied you?’ he asked.  ‘This bag?  And why, in the\nname of eccentricity, a bag?  For an empty one, you might have relied on\nmy own foresight; and this one is very far from being empty.  My dear\nCount, with what trash have you come laden?  But the shortest method is\nto see for myself.’  And he put down his hand.\n\nShe stopped him at once.  ‘Otto,’ she said, ‘no—not that way.  I will\ntell, I will make a clean breast.  It is done already.  I have robbed the\ntreasury single-handed.  There are three thousand two hundred crowns.  O,\nI trust it is enough!’\n\nHer embarrassment was so obvious that the Prince was struck into a muse,\ngazing in her face, with his hand still outstretched, and she still\nholding him by the wrist.  ‘You!’ he said at last.  ‘How?’ And then\ndrawing himself up, ‘O madam,’ he cried, ‘I understand.  You must indeed\nthink meanly of the Prince.’\n\n‘Well, then, it was a lie!’ she cried.  ‘The money is mine, honestly my\nown—now yours.  This was an unworthy act that you proposed.  But I love\nyour honour, and I swore to myself that I should save it in your teeth.\nI beg of you to let me save it’—with a sudden lovely change of tone.\n‘Otto, I beseech you let me save it.  Take this dross from your poor\nfriend who loves you!’\n\n‘Madam, madam,’ babbled Otto, in the extreme of misery, ‘I cannot—I must\ngo.’\n\nAnd he half rose; but she was on the ground before him in an instant,\nclasping his knees.  ‘No,’ she gasped, ‘you shall not go.  Do you despise\nme so entirely?  It is dross; I hate it; I should squander it at play and\nbe no richer; it is an investment, it is to save me from ruin.  Otto,’\nshe cried, as he again feebly tried to put her from him, ‘if you leave me\nalone in this disgrace, I will die here!’  He groaned aloud.  ‘O,’ she\nsaid, ‘think what I suffer!  If you suffer from a piece of delicacy,\nthink what I suffer in my shame!  To have my trash refused!  You would\nrather steal, you think of me so basely!  You would rather tread my heart\nin pieces!  O, unkind!  O my Prince!  O Otto!  O pity me!’  She was still\nclasping him; then she found his hand and covered it with kisses, and at\nthis his head began to turn.  ‘O,’ she cried again, ‘I see it!  O what a\nhorror!  It is because I am old, because I am no longer beautiful.’  And\nshe burst into a storm of sobs.\n\nThis was the _coup de grâce_.  Otto had now to comfort and compose her as\nhe could, and before many words, the money was accepted.  Between the\nwoman and the weak man such was the inevitable end.  Madame von Rosen\ninstantly composed her sobs.  She thanked him with a fluttering voice,\nand resumed her place upon the bench, at the far end from Otto.  ‘Now you\nsee,’ she said, ‘why I bade you keep the thief at distance, and why I\ncame alone.  How I trembled for my treasure!’\n\n‘Madam,’ said Otto, with a tearful whimper in his voice, ‘spare me!  You\nare too good, too noble!’\n\n‘I wonder to hear you,’ she returned.  ‘You have avoided a great folly.\nYou will be able to meet your good old peasant.  You have found an\nexcellent investment for a friend’s money.  You have preferred essential\nkindness to an empty scruple; and now you are ashamed of it!  You have\nmade your friend happy; and now you mourn as the dove!  Come, cheer up.\nI know it is depressing to have done exactly right; but you need not make\na practice of it.  Forgive yourself this virtue; come now, look me in the\nface and smile!’\n\nHe did look at her.  When a man has been embraced by a woman, he sees her\nin a glamour; and at such a time, in the baffling glimmer of the stars,\nshe will look wildly well.  The hair is touched with light; the eyes are\nconstellations; the face sketched in shadows—a sketch, you might say, by\npassion.  Otto became consoled for his defeat; he began to take an\ninterest.  ‘No,’ he said, ‘I am no ingrate.’\n\n‘You promised me fun,’ she returned, with a laugh.  ‘I have given you as\ngood.  We have had a stormy _scena_.’\n\nHe laughed in his turn, and the sound of the laughter, in either case,\nwas hardly reassuring.\n\n‘Come, what are you going to give me in exchange,’ she continued, ‘for my\nexcellent declamation?’\n\n‘What you will,’ he said.\n\n‘Whatever I will?  Upon your honour?  Suppose I asked the crown?’  She\nwas flashing upon him, beautiful in triumph.\n\n‘Upon my honour,’ he replied.\n\n‘Shall I ask the crown?’ she continued.  ‘Nay; what should I do with it?\nGrünewald is but a petty state; my ambition swells above it.  I shall\nask—I find I want nothing,’ she concluded.  ‘I will give you something\ninstead.  I will give you leave to kiss me—once.’\n\nOtto drew near, and she put up her face; they were both smiling, both on\nthe brink of laughter, all was so innocent and playful; and the Prince,\nwhen their lips encountered, was dumbfoundered by the sudden convulsion\nof his being.  Both drew instantly apart, and for an appreciable time sat\ntongue-tied.  Otto was indistinctly conscious of a peril in the silence,\nbut could find no words to utter.  Suddenly the Countess seemed to awake.\n‘As for your wife—’ she began in a clear and steady voice.\n\nThe word recalled Otto, with a shudder, from his trance.  ‘I will hear\nnothing against my wife,’ he cried wildly; and then, recovering himself\nand in a kindlier tone, ‘I will tell you my one secret,’ he added.  ‘I\nlove my wife.’\n\n‘You should have let me finish,’ she returned, smiling.  ‘Do you suppose\nI did not mention her on purpose?  You know you had lost your head.\nWell, so had I.  Come now, do not be abashed by words,’ she added\nsomewhat sharply.  ‘It is the one thing I despise.  If you are not a\nfool, you will see that I am building fortresses about your virtue.  And\nat any rate, I choose that you shall understand that I am not dying of\nlove for you.  It is a very smiling business; no tragedy for me!  And now\nhere is what I have to say about your wife; she is not and she never has\nbeen Gondremark’s mistress.  Be sure he would have boasted if she had.\nGood-night!’\n\nAnd in a moment she was gone down the alley, and Otto was alone with the\nbag of money and the flying god.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X—GOTTHOLD’S REVISED OPINION; AND THE FALL COMPLETED\n\n\nThe Countess left poor Otto with a caress and buffet simultaneously\nadministered.  The welcome word about his wife and the virtuous ending of\nhis interview should doubtless have delighted him.  But for all that, as\nhe shouldered the bag of money and set forward to rejoin his groom, he\nwas conscious of many aching sensibilities.  To have gone wrong and to\nhave been set right makes but a double trial for man’s vanity.  The\ndiscovery of his own weakness and possible unfaith had staggered him to\nthe heart; and to hear, in the same hour, of his wife’s fidelity from one\nwho loved her not, increased the bitterness of the surprise.\n\nHe was about half-way between the fountain and the Flying Mercury before\nhis thoughts began to be clear; and he was surprised to find them\nresentful.  He paused in a kind of temper, and struck with his hand a\nlittle shrub.  Thence there arose instantly a cloud of awakened sparrows,\nwhich as instantly dispersed and disappeared into the thicket.  He looked\nat them stupidly, and when they were gone continued staring at the stars.\n‘I am angry.  By what right?  By none!’ he thought; but he was still\nangry.  He cursed Madame von Rosen and instantly repented.  Heavy was the\nmoney on his shoulders.\n\nWhen he reached the fountain, he did, out of ill-humour and parade, an\nunpardonable act.  He gave the money bodily to the dishonest groom.\n‘Keep this for me,’ he said, ‘until I call for it to-morrow.  It is a\ngreat sum, and by that you will judge that I have not condemned you.’\nAnd he strode away ruffling, as if he had done something generous.  It\nwas a desperate stroke to re-enter at the point of the bayonet into his\nself-esteem; and, like all such, it was fruitless in the end.  He got to\nbed with the devil, it appeared: kicked and tumbled till the grey of the\nmorning; and then fell inopportunely into a leaden slumber, and awoke to\nfind it ten.  To miss the appointment with old Killian after all, had\nbeen too tragic a miscarriage: and he hurried with all his might, found\nthe groom (for a wonder) faithful to his trust, and arrived only a few\nminutes before noon in the guest-chamber of the Morning Star.  Killian\nwas there in his Sunday’s best and looking very gaunt and rigid; a lawyer\nfrom Brandenau stood sentinel over his outspread papers; and the groom\nand the landlord of the inn were called to serve as witnesses.  The\nobvious deference of that great man, the innkeeper, plainly affected the\nold farmer with surprise; but it was not until Otto had taken the pen and\nsigned that the truth flashed upon him fully.  Then, indeed, he was\nbeside himself.\n\n‘His Highness!’ he cried, ‘His Highness!’ and repeated the exclamation\ntill his mind had grappled fairly with the facts.  Then he turned to the\nwitnesses.  ‘Gentlemen,’ he said, ‘you dwell in a country highly favoured\nby God; for of all generous gentlemen, I will say it on my conscience,\nthis one is the king.  I am an old man, and I have seen good and bad, and\nthe year of the great famine; but a more excellent gentleman, no, never.’\n\n‘We know that,’ cried the landlord, ‘we know that well in Grünewald.  If\nwe saw more of his Highness we should be the better pleased.’\n\n‘It is the kindest Prince,’ began the groom, and suddenly closed his\nmouth upon a sob, so that every one turned to gaze upon his emotion—Otto\nnot last; Otto struck with remorse, to see the man so grateful.\n\nThen it was the lawyer’s turn to pay a compliment.  ‘I do not know what\nProvidence may hold in store,’ he said, ‘but this day should be a bright\none in the annals of your reign.  The shouts of armies could not be more\neloquent than the emotion on these honest faces.’  And the Brandenau\nlawyer bowed, skipped, stepped back, and took snuff, with the air of a\nman who has found and seized an opportunity.\n\n‘Well, young gentleman,’ said Killian, ‘if you will pardon me the\nplainness of calling you a gentleman, many a good day’s work you have\ndone, I doubt not, but never a better, or one that will be better\nblessed; and whatever, sir, may be your happiness and triumph in that\nhigh sphere to which you have been called, it will be none the worse,\nsir, for an old man’s blessing!’\n\nThe scene had almost assumed the proportions of an ovation; and when the\nPrince escaped he had but one thought: to go wherever he was most sure of\npraise.  His conduct at the board of council occurred to him as a fair\nchapter; and this evoked the memory of Gotthold.  To Gotthold he would\ngo.\n\nGotthold was in the library as usual, and laid down his pen, a little\nangrily, on Otto’s entrance.  ‘Well,’ he said, ‘here you are.’\n\n‘Well,’ returned Otto, ‘we made a revolution, I believe.’\n\n‘It is what I fear,’ returned the Doctor.\n\n‘How?’ said Otto.  ‘Fear?  Fear is the burnt child.  I have learned my\nstrength and the weakness of the others; and I now mean to govern.’\n\nGotthold said nothing, but he looked down and smoothed his chin.\n\n‘You disapprove?’ cried Otto.  ‘You are a weather-cock.’\n\n‘On the contrary,’ replied the Doctor.  ‘My observation has confirmed my\nfears.  It will not do, Otto, not do.’\n\n‘What will not do?’ demanded the Prince, with a sickening stab of pain.\n\n‘None of it,’ answered Gotthold.  ‘You are unfitted for a life of action;\nyou lack the stamina, the habit, the restraint, the patience.  Your wife\nis greatly better, vastly better; and though she is in bad hands,\ndisplays a very different aptitude.  She is a woman of affairs; you\nare—dear boy, you are yourself.  I bid you back to your amusements; like\na smiling dominie, I give you holidays for life.  Yes,’ he continued,\n‘there is a day appointed for all when they shall turn again upon their\nown philosophy.  I had grown to disbelieve impartially in all; and if in\nthe atlas of the sciences there were two charts I disbelieved in more\nthan all the rest, they were politics and morals.  I had a sneaking\nkindness for your vices; as they were negative, they flattered my\nphilosophy; and I called them almost virtues.  Well, Otto, I was wrong; I\nhave forsworn my sceptical philosophy; and I perceive your faults to be\nunpardonable.  You are unfit to be a Prince, unfit to be a husband.  And\nI give you my word, I would rather see a man capably doing evil than\nblundering about good.’\n\nOtto was still silent, in extreme dudgeon.\n\nPresently the Doctor resumed: ‘I will take the smaller matter first: your\nconduct to your wife.  You went, I hear, and had an explanation.  That\nmay have been right or wrong; I know not; at least, you had stirred her\ntemper.  At the council she insults you; well, you insult her back—a man\nto a woman, a husband to his wife, in public!  Next upon the back of\nthis, you propose—the story runs like wildfire—to recall the power of\nsignature.  Can she ever forgive that? a woman—a young woman—ambitious,\nconscious of talents beyond yours?  Never, Otto.  And to sum all, at such\na crisis in your married life, you get into a window corner with that\nogling dame von Rosen.  I do not dream that there was any harm; but I do\nsay it was an idle disrespect to your wife.  Why, man, the woman is not\ndecent.’\n\n‘Gotthold,’ said Otto, ‘I will hear no evil of the Countess.’\n\n‘You will certainly hear no good of her,’ returned Gotthold; ‘and if you\nwish your wife to be the pink of nicety, you should clear your court of\ndemi-reputations.’\n\n‘The commonplace injustice of a by-word,’ Otto cried.  ‘The partiality of\nsex.  She is a demirep; what then is Gondremark?  Were she a man—’\n\n‘It would be all one,’ retorted Gotthold roughly.  ‘When I see a man,\ncome to years of wisdom, who speaks in double-meanings and is the\nbraggart of his vices, I spit on the other side.  “You, my friend,” say\nI, “are not even a gentleman.”  Well, she’s not even a lady.’\n\n‘She is the best friend I have, and I choose that she shall be\nrespected,’ Otto said.\n\n‘If she is your friend, so much the worse,’ replied the Doctor.  ‘It will\nnot stop there.’\n\n‘Ah!’ cried Otto, ‘there is the charity of virtue!  All evil in the\nspotted fruit.  But I can tell you, sir, that you do Madame von Rosen\nprodigal injustice.’\n\n‘You can tell me!’ said the Doctor shrewdly.  ‘Have you, tried? have you\nbeen riding the marches?’\n\nThe blood came into Otto’s face.\n\n‘Ah!’ cried Gotthold, ‘look at your wife and blush!  There’s a wife for a\nman to marry and then lose!  She’s a carnation, Otto.  The soul is in her\neyes.’\n\n‘You have changed your note for Seraphina, I perceive,’ said Otto.\n\n‘Changed it!’ cried the Doctor, with a flush.  ‘Why, when was it\ndifferent?  But I own I admired her at the council.  When she sat there\nsilent, tapping with her foot, I admired her as I might a hurricane.\nWere I one of those who venture upon matrimony, there had been the prize\nto tempt me!  She invites, as Mexico invited Cortez; the enterprise is\nhard, the natives are unfriendly—I believe them cruel too—but the\nmetropolis is paved with gold and the breeze blows out of paradise.  Yes,\nI could desire to be that conqueror.  But to philander with von Rosen!\nnever!  Senses?  I discard them; what are they?—pruritus!  Curiosity?\nReach me my Anatomy!’\n\n‘To whom do you address yourself?’ cried Otto.  ‘Surely you, of all men,\nknow that I love my wife!’\n\n‘O, love!’ cried Gotthold; ‘love is a great word; it is in all the\ndictionaries.  If you had loved, she would have paid you back.  What does\nshe ask?  A little ardour!’\n\n‘It is hard to love for two,’ replied the Prince.\n\n‘Hard?  Why, there’s the touchstone!  O, I know my poets!’ cried the\nDoctor.  ‘We are but dust and fire, too and to endure life’s scorching;\nand love, like the shadow of a great rock, should lend shelter and\nrefreshment, not to the lover only, but to his mistress and to the\nchildren that reward them; and their very friends should seek repose in\nthe fringes of that peace.  Love is not love that cannot build a home.\nAnd you call it love to grudge and quarrel and pick faults?  You call it\nlove to thwart her to her face, and bandy insults?  Love!’\n\n‘Gotthold, you are unjust.  I was then fighting for my country,’ said the\nPrince.\n\n‘Ay, and there’s the worst of all,’ returned the Doctor.  ‘You could not\neven see that you were wrong; that being where they were, retreat was\nruin.’\n\nWhy, you supported me!’ cried Otto.\n\n‘I did.  I was a fool like you,’ replied Gotthold.  ‘But now my eyes are\nopen.  If you go on as you have started, disgrace this fellow Gondremark,\nand publish the scandal of your divided house, there will befall a most\nabominable thing in Grünewald.  A revolution, friend—a revolution.’\n\n‘You speak strangely for a red,’ said Otto.\n\n‘A red republican, but not a revolutionary,’ returned the Doctor.  ‘An\nugly thing is a Grünewalder drunk!  One man alone can save the country\nfrom this pass, and that is the double-dealer Gondremark, with whom I\nconjure you to make peace.  It will not be you; it never can be you:—you,\nwho can do nothing, as your wife said, but trade upon your station—you,\nwho spent the hours in begging money!  And in God’s name, what for?  Why\nmoney?  What mystery of idiocy was this?’\n\n‘It was to no ill end.  It was to buy a farm,’ quoth Otto sulkily.\n\n‘To buy a farm!’ cried Gotthold.  ‘Buy a farm!’\n\n‘Well, what then?’ returned Otto. ‘I have bought it, if you come to\nthat.’\n\nGotthold fairly bounded on his seat.  ‘And how that?’ he cried.\n\n‘How?’ repeated Otto, startled.\n\n‘Ay, verily, how!’ returned the Doctor.  ‘How came you by the money?’\n\nThe Prince’s countenance darkened.  ‘That is my affair,’ said he.\n\n‘You see you are ashamed,’ retorted Gotthold.  ‘And so you bought a farm\nin the hour of our country’s need—doubtless to be ready for the\nabdication; and I put it that you stole the funds.  There are not three\nways of getting money: there are but two: to earn and steal.  And now,\nwhen you have combined Charles the Fifth and Long-fingered Tom, you come\nto me to fortify your vanity!  But I will clear my mind upon this matter:\nuntil I know the right and wrong of the transaction, I put my hand behind\nmy back.  A man may be the pitifullest prince; he must be a spotless\ngentleman.’\n\nThe Prince had gotten to his feet, as pale as paper.  Gotthold,’ he said,\n‘you drive me beyond bounds.  Beware, sir, beware!’\n\n‘Do you threaten me, friend Otto?’ asked the Doctor grimly.  ‘That would\nbe a strange conclusion.’\n\n‘When have you ever known me use my power in any private animosity?’\ncried Otto.  ‘To any private man your words were an unpardonable insult,\nbut at me you shoot in full security, and I must turn aside to compliment\nyou on your plainness.  I must do more than pardon, I must admire,\nbecause you have faced this—this formidable monarch, like a Nathan before\nDavid.  You have uprooted an old kindness, sir, with an unsparing hand.\nYou leave me very bare.  My last bond is broken; and though I take Heaven\nto witness that I sought to do the right, I have this reward: to find\nmyself alone.  You say I am no gentleman; yet the sneers have been upon\nyour side; and though I can very well perceive where you have lodged your\nsympathies, I will forbear the taunt.’\n\n‘Otto, are you insane?’ cried Gotthold, leaping up.  ‘Because I ask you\nhow you came by certain moneys, and because you refuse—’\n\n‘Herr von Hohenstockwitz, I have ceased to invite your aid in my\naffairs,’ said Otto.  ‘I have heard all that I desire, and you have\nsufficiently trampled on my vanity.  It may be that I cannot govern, it\nmay be that I cannot love—you tell me so with every mark of honesty; but\nGod has granted me one virtue, and I can still forgive.  I forgive you;\neven in this hour of passion, I can perceive my faults and your excuses;\nand if I desire that in future I may be spared your conversation, it is\nnot, sir, from resentment—not resentment—but, by Heaven, because no man\non earth could endure to be so rated.  You have the satisfaction to see\nyour sovereign weep; and that person whom you have so often taunted with\nhis happiness reduced to the last pitch of solitude and misery.  No,—I\nwill hear nothing; I claim the last word, sir, as your Prince; and that\nlast word shall be—forgiveness.’\n\nAnd with that Otto was gone from the apartment, and Doctor Gotthold was\nleft alone with the most conflicting sentiments of sorrow, remorse, and\nmerriment; walking to and fro before his table, and asking himself, with\nhands uplifted, which of the pair of them was most to blame for this\nunhappy rupture.  Presently, he took from a cupboard a bottle of Rhine\nwine and a goblet of the deep Bohemian ruby.  The first glass a little\nwarmed and comforted his bosom; with the second he began to look down\nupon these troubles from a sunny mountain; yet a while, and filled with\nthis false comfort and contemplating life throughout a golden medium, he\nowned to himself, with a flush, a smile, and a half-pleasurable sigh,\nthat he had been somewhat over plain in dealing with his cousin.  ‘He\nsaid the truth, too,’ added the penitent librarian, ‘for in my monkish\nfashion I adore the Princess.’  And then, with a still deepening flush\nand a certain stealth, although he sat all alone in that great gallery,\nhe toasted Seraphina to the dregs.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI—PROVIDENCE VON ROSEN: ACT THE FIRST\nSHE BEGUILES THE BARON\n\n\nAt a sufficiently late hour, or to be more exact, at three in the\nafternoon, Madame von Rosen issued on the world.  She swept downstairs\nand out across the garden, a black mantilla thrown over her head, and the\nlong train of her black velvet dress ruthlessly sweeping in the dirt.\n\nAt the other end of that long garden, and back to back with the villa of\nthe Countess, stood the large mansion where the Prime Minister transacted\nhis affairs and pleasures.  This distance, which was enough for decency\nby the easy canons of Mittwalden, the Countess swiftly traversed, opened\na little door with a key, mounted a flight of stairs, and entered\nunceremoniously into Gondremark’s study.  It was a large and very high\napartment; books all about the walls, papers on the table, papers on the\nfloor; here and there a picture, somewhat scant of drapery; a great fire\nglowing and flaming in the blue tiled hearth; and the daylight streaming\nthrough a cupola above.  In the midst of this sat the great Baron\nGondremark in his shirt-sleeves, his business for that day fairly at an\nend, and the hour arrived for relaxation.  His expression, his very\nnature, seemed to have undergone a fundamental change.  Gondremark at\nhome appeared the very antipode of Gondremark on duty.  He had an air of\nmassive jollity that well became him; grossness and geniality sat upon\nhis features; and along with his manners, he had laid aside his sly and\nsinister expression.  He lolled there, sunning his bulk before the fire,\na noble animal.\n\n‘Hey!’ he cried.  ‘At last!’\n\nThe Countess stepped into the room in silence, threw herself on a chair,\nand crossed her legs.  In her lace and velvet, with a good display of\nsmooth black stocking and of snowy petticoat, and with the refined\nprofile of her face and slender plumpness of her body, she showed in\nsingular contrast to the big, black, intellectual satyr by the fire.\n\n‘How often do you send for me?’ she cried.  ‘It is compromising.’\n\nGondremark laughed.  ‘Speaking of that,’ said he, ‘what in the devil’s\nname were you about?  You were not home till morning.’\n\n‘I was giving alms,’ she said.\n\nThe Baron again laughed loud and long, for in his shirt-sleeves he was a\nvery mirthful creature.  ‘It is fortunate I am not jealous,’ he remarked.\n‘But you know my way: pleasure and liberty go hand in hand.  I believe\nwhat I believe; it is not much, but I believe it.—But now to business.\nHave you not read my letter?’\n\n‘No,’ she said; ‘my head ached.’\n\n‘Ah, well! then I have news indeed!’ cried Gondremark.  ‘I was mad to see\nyou all last night and all this morning: for yesterday afternoon I\nbrought my long business to a head; the ship has come home; one more dead\nlift, and I shall cease to fetch and carry for the Princess Ratafia.\nYes, ’tis done.  I have the order all in Ratafia’s hand; I carry it on my\nheart.  At the hour of twelve to-night, Prince Featherhead is to be taken\nin his bed and, like the bambino, whipped into a chariot; and by next\nmorning he will command a most romantic prospect from the donjon of the\nFelsenburg.  Farewell, Featherhead!  The war goes on, the girl is in my\nhand; I have long been indispensable, but now I shall be sole.  I have\nlong,’ he added exultingly, ‘long carried this intrigue upon my\nshoulders, like Samson with the gates of Gaza; now I discharge that\nburthen.’\n\nShe had sprung to her feet a little paler.  ‘Is this true?’ she cried.\n\n‘I tell you a fact,’ he asseverated.  ‘The trick is played.’\n\n‘I will never believe it,’ she said.  ‘An order in her own hand?  I will\nnever believe it, Heinrich.’\n\n‘I swear to you,’ said he.\n\n‘O, what do you care for oaths—or I either?  What would you swear by?\nWine, women, and song?  It is not binding,’ she said.  She had come quite\nclose up to him and laid her hand upon his arm.  ‘As for the order—no,\nHeinrich, never!  I will never believe it.  I will die ere I believe it.\nYou have some secret purpose—what, I cannot guess—but not one word of it\nis true.’\n\n‘Shall I show it you?’ he asked.\n\n‘You cannot,’ she answered.  ‘There is no such thing.’\n\n‘Incorrigible Sadducee!’ he cried.  ‘Well, I will convert you; you shall\nsee the order.’  He moved to a chair where he had thrown his coat, and\nthen drawing forth and holding out a paper, ‘Read,’ said he.\n\nShe took it greedily, and her eye flashed as she perused it.\n\n‘Hey!’ cried the Baron, ‘there falls a dynasty, and it was I that felled\nit; and I and you inherit!’  He seemed to swell in stature; and next\nmoment, with a laugh, he put his hand forward.  Give me the dagger,’ said\nhe.\n\nBut she whisked the paper suddenly behind her back and faced him,\nlowering.  ‘No, no,’ she said.  ‘You and I have first a point to settle.\nDo you suppose me blind?  She could never have given that paper but to\none man, and that man her lover.  Here you stand—her lover, her\naccomplice, her master—O, I well believe it, for I know your power.  But\nwhat am I?’ she cried; ‘I, whom you deceive!’\n\n‘Jealousy!’ cried Gondremark.  ‘Anna, I would never have believed it!\nBut I declare to you by all that’s credible that I am not her lover.  I\nmight be, I suppose; but I never yet durst risk the declaration.  The\nchit is so unreal; a mincing doll; she will and she will not; there is no\ncounting on her, by God!  And hitherto I have had my own way without, and\nkeep the lover in reserve.  And I say, Anna,’ he added with severity,\n‘you must break yourself of this new fit, my girl; there must be no\ncombustion.  I keep the creature under the belief that I adore her; and\nif she caught a breath of you and me, she is such a fool, prude, and dog\nin the manger, that she is capable of spoiling all.’\n\n‘All very fine,’ returned the lady.  ‘With whom do you pass your days?\nand which am I to believe, your words or your actions?’\n\n‘Anna, the devil take you, are you blind?’ cried Gondremark.  ‘You know\nme.  Am I likely to care for such a preciosa?  ’Tis hard that we should\nhave been together for so long, and you should still take me for a\ntroubadour.  But if there is one thing that I despise and deprecate, it\nis all such figures in Berlin wool.  Give me a human woman—like myself.\nYou are my mate; you were made for me; you amuse me like the play.  And\nwhat have I to gain that I should pretend to you?  If I do not love you,\nwhat use are you to me?  Why, none.  It is as clear as noonday.’\n\n‘Do you love me, Heinrich?’ she asked, languishing.  ‘Do you truly?’\n\n‘I tell you,’ he cried, ‘I love you next after myself.  I should be all\nabroad if I had lost you.’\n\n‘Well, then,’ said she, folding up the paper and putting it calmly in her\npocket, ‘I will believe you, and I join the plot.  Count upon me.  At\nmidnight, did you say?  It is Gordon, I see, that you have charged with\nit.  Excellent; he will stick at nothing—’\n\nGondremark watched her suspiciously.  ‘Why do you take the paper?’ he\ndemanded.  ‘Give it here.’\n\n‘No,’ she returned; ‘I mean to keep it.  It is I who must prepare the\nstroke; you cannot manage it without me; and to do my best I must possess\nthe paper.  Where shall I find Gordon?  In his rooms?’  She spoke with a\nrather feverish self-possession.\n\n‘Anna,’ he said sternly, the black, bilious countenance of his palace\n_rôle_ taking the place of the more open favour of his hours at home, ‘I\nask you for that paper.  Once, twice, and thrice.’\n\n‘Heinrich,’ she returned, looking him in the face, ‘take care.  I will\nput up with no dictation.’\n\nBoth looked dangerous; and the silence lasted for a measurable interval\nof time.  Then she made haste to have the first word; and with a laugh\nthat rang clear and honest, ‘Do not be a child,’ she said.  ‘I wonder at\nyou.  If your assurances are true, you can have no reason to mistrust me,\nnor I to play you false.  The difficulty is to get the Prince out of the\npalace without scandal.  His valets are devoted; his chamberlain a slave;\nand yet one cry might ruin all.’\n\n‘They must be overpowered,’ he said, following her to the new ground,\n‘and disappear along with him.’\n\n‘And your whole scheme along with them!’ she cried.  ‘He does not take\nhis servants when he goes a-hunting: a child could read the truth.  No,\nno; the plan is idiotic; it must be Ratafia’s.  But hear me.  You know\nthe Prince worships me?’\n\n‘I know,’ he said.  ‘Poor Featherhead, I cross his destiny!’\n\n‘Well now,’ she continued, ‘what if I bring him alone out of the palace,\nto some quiet corner of the Park—the Flying Mercury, for instance?\nGordon can be posted in the thicket; the carriage wait behind the temple;\nnot a cry, not a scuffle, not a footfall; simply, the Prince\nvanishes!—What do you say?  Am I an able ally?  Are my _beaux yuex_ of\nservice?  Ah, Heinrich, do not lose your Anna!—she has power!’\n\nHe struck with his open hand upon the chimney.  ‘Witch!’ he said, ‘there\nis not your match for devilry in Europe.  Service! the thing runs on\nwheels.’\n\n‘Kiss me, then, and let me go.  I must not miss my Featherhead,’ she\nsaid.\n\n‘Stay, stay,’ said the Baron; ‘not so fast.  I wish, upon my soul, that I\ncould trust you; but you are, out and in, so whimsical a devil that I\ndare not.  Hang it, Anna, no; it’s not possible!’\n\n‘You doubt me, Heinrich?’ she cried.\n\n‘Doubt is not the word,’ said he.  ‘I know you.  Once you were clear of\nme with that paper in your pocket, who knows what you would do with\nit?—not you, at least—nor I.  You see,’ he added, shaking his head\npaternally upon the Countess, ‘you are as vicious as a monkey.’\n\n‘I swear to you,’ she cried, ‘by my salvation . . . ‘\n\n‘I have no curiosity to hear you swearing,’ said the Baron.\n\n‘You think that I have no religion?  You suppose me destitute of honour.\nWell,’ she said, ‘see here: I will not argue, but I tell you once for\nall: leave me this order, and the Prince shall be arrested—take it from\nme, and, as certain as I speak, I will upset the coach.  Trust me, or\nfear me: take your choice.’  And she offered him the paper.\n\nThe Baron, in a great contention of mind, stood irresolute, weighing the\ntwo dangers.  Once his hand advanced, then dropped.  ‘Well,’ he said,\n‘since trust is what you call it . . .’\n\n‘No more,’ she interrupted, ‘Do not spoil your attitude.  And now since\nyou have behaved like a good sort of fellow in the dark, I will\ncondescend to tell you why.  I go to the palace to arrange with Gordon;\nbut how is Gordon to obey me?  And how can I foresee the hours?  It may\nbe midnight; ay, and it may be nightfall; all’s a chance; and to act, I\nmust be free and hold the strings of the adventure.  And now,’ she cried,\n‘your Vivien goes.  Dub me your knight!’  And she held out her arms and\nsmiled upon him radiant.\n\n‘Well,’ he said, when he had kissed her, ‘every man must have his folly;\nI thank God mine is no worse.  Off with you!  I have given a child a\nsquib.’\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII—PROVIDENCE VON ROSEN: ACT THE SECOND\nSHE INFORMS THE PRINCE\n\n\nIt was the first impulse of Madame von Rosen to return to her own villa\nand revise her toilette.  Whatever else should come of this adventure, it\nwas her firm design to pay a visit to the Princess.  And before that\nwoman, so little beloved, the Countess would appear at no disadvantage.\nIt was the work of minutes.  Von Rosen had the captain’s eye in matters\nof the toilette; she was none of those who hang in Fabian helplessness\namong their finery and, after hours, come forth upon the world as\ndowdies.  A glance, a loosened curl, a studied and admired disorder in\nthe hair, a bit of lace, a touch of colour, a yellow rose in the bosom;\nand the instant picture was complete.\n\n‘That will do,’ she said.  ‘Bid my carriage follow me to the palace.  In\nhalf an hour it should be there in waiting.’\n\nThe night was beginning to fall and the shops to shine with lamps along\nthe tree-beshadowed thorough-fares of Otto’s capital, when the Countess\nstarted on her high emprise.  She was jocund at heart; pleasure and\ninterest had winged her beauty, and she knew it.  She paused before the\nglowing jeweller’s; she remarked and praised a costume in the milliner’s\nwindow; and when she reached the lime-tree walk, with its high,\numbrageous arches and stir of passers-by in the dim alleys, she took her\nplace upon a bench and began to dally with the pleasures of the hour.  It\nwas cold, but she did not feel it, being warm within; her thoughts, in\nthat dark corner, shone like the gold and rubies at the jewellers; her\nears, which heard the brushing of so many footfalls, transposed it into\nmusic.\n\nWhat was she to do?  She held the paper by which all depended.  Otto and\nGondremark and Ratafia, and the state itself, hung light in her balances,\nas light as dust; her little finger laid in either scale would set all\nflying: and she hugged herself upon her huge preponderance, and then\nlaughed aloud to think how giddily it might be used.  The vertigo of\nomnipotence, the disease of Cæsars, shook her reason.  ‘O the mad world!’\nshe thought, and laughed aloud in exultation.\n\nA child, finger in mouth, had paused a little way from where she sat, and\nstared with cloudy interest upon this laughing lady.  She called it\nnearer; but the child hung back.  Instantly, with that curious passion\nwhich you may see any woman in the world display, on the most odd\noccasions, for a similar end, the Countess bent herself with singleness\nof mind to overcome this diffidence; and presently, sure enough, the\nchild was seated on her knee, thumbing and glowering at her watch.\n\n‘If you had a clay bear and a china monkey,’ asked Von Rosen, ‘which\nwould you prefer to break?’\n\n‘But I have neither,’ said the child.\n\n‘Well,’ she said, ‘here is a bright florin, with which you may purchase\nboth the one and the other; and I shall give it you at once, if you will\nanswer my question.  The clay bear or the china monkey—come?’\n\nBut the unbreeched soothsayer only stared upon the florin with big eyes;\nthe oracle could not be persuaded to reply; and the Countess kissed him\nlightly, gave him the florin, set him down upon the path, and resumed her\nway with swinging and elastic gait.\n\n‘Which shall I break?’ she wondered; and she passed her hand with delight\namong the careful disarrangement of her locks.  ‘Which?’ and she\nconsulted heaven with her bright eyes.  ‘Do I love both or neither?  A\nlittle—passionately—not at all?  Both or neither—both, I believe; but at\nleast I will make hay of Ratafia.’\n\nBy the time she had passed the iron gates, mounted the drive, and set her\nfoot upon the broad flagged terrace, the night had come completely; the\npalace front was thick with lighted windows; and along the balustrade,\nthe lamp on every twentieth baluster shone clear.  A few withered tracks\nof sunset, amber and glow-worm green, still lingered in the western sky;\nand she paused once again to watch them fading.\n\n‘And to think,’ she said, ‘that here am I—destiny embodied, a norn, a\nfate, a providence—and have no guess upon which side I shall declare\nmyself!  What other woman in my place would not be prejudiced, and think\nherself committed?  But, thank Heaven!  I was born just!’  Otto’s windows\nwere bright among the rest, and she looked on them with rising\ntenderness.  ‘How does it feel to be deserted?’ she thought.  ‘Poor dear\nfool!  The girl deserves that he should see this order.’\n\nWithout more delay, she passed into the palace and asked for an audience\nof Prince Otto.  The Prince, she was told, was in his own apartment, and\ndesired to be private.  She sent her name.  A man presently returned with\nword that the Prince tendered his apologies, but could see no one.  ‘Then\nI will write,’ she said, and scribbled a few lines alleging urgency of\nlife and death.  ‘Help me, my Prince,’ she added; ‘none but you can help\nme.’  This time the messenger returned more speedily, and begged the\nCountess to follow him: the Prince was graciously pleased to receive the\nFrau Gräfin von Rosen.\n\nOtto sat by the fire in his large armoury, weapons faintly glittering all\nabout him in the changeful light.  His face was disfigured by the marks\nof weeping; he looked sour and sad; nor did he rise to greet his visitor,\nbut bowed, and bade the man begone.  That kind of general tenderness\nwhich served the Countess for both heart and conscience, sharply smote\nher at this spectacle of grief and weakness; she began immediately to\nenter into the spirit of her part; and as soon as they were alone, taking\none step forward and with a magnificent gesture—‘Up!’ she cried.\n\n‘Madame von Rosen,’ replied Otto dully, ‘you have used strong words.  You\nspeak of life and death.  Pray, madam, who is threatened?  Who is there,’\nhe added bitterly, ‘so destitute that even Otto of Grünewald can assist\nhim?’\n\n‘First learn,’ said she, ‘the names of the conspirators; the Princess and\nthe Baron Gondremark.  Can you not guess the rest?’  And then, as he\nmaintained his silence—‘You!’ she cried, pointing at him with her finger.\n‘’Tis you they threaten!  Your rascal and mine have laid their heads\ntogether and condemned you.  But they reckoned without you and me.  We\nmake a _partie carrée_, Prince, in love and politics.  They lead an ace,\nbut we shall trump it.  Come, partner, shall I draw my card?’\n\n‘Madam,’ he said, ‘explain yourself.  Indeed I fail to comprehend.’\n\n‘See, then,’ said she; and handed him the order.\n\nHe took it, looked upon it with a start; and then, still without speech,\nhe put his hand before his face.  She waited for a word in vain.\n\n‘What!’ she cried, ‘do you take the thing down-heartedly?  As well seek\nwine in a milk-pail as love in that girl’s heart!  Be done with this, and\nbe a man.  After the league of the lions, let us have a conspiracy of\nmice, and pull this piece of machinery to ground.  You were brisk enough\nlast night when nothing was at stake and all was frolic.  Well, here is\nbetter sport; here is life indeed.’\n\nHe got to his feet with some alacrity, and his face, which was a little\nflushed, bore the marks of resolution.\n\n‘Madame von Rosen,’ said he, ‘I am neither unconscious nor ungrateful;\nthis is the true continuation of your friendship; but I see that I must\ndisappoint your expectations.  You seem to expect from me some effort of\nresistance; but why should I resist?  I have not much to gain; and now\nthat I have read this paper, and the last of a fool’s paradise is\nshattered, it would be hyperbolical to speak of loss in the same breath\nwith Otto of Grünewald.  I have no party, no policy; no pride, nor\nanything to be proud of.  For what benefit or principle under Heaven do\nyou expect me to contend?  Or would you have me bite and scratch like a\ntrapped weasel?  No, madam; signify to those who sent you my readiness to\ngo.  I would at least avoid a scandal.’\n\n‘You go?—of your own will, you go?’ she cried.\n\n‘I cannot say so much, perhaps,’ he answered; ‘but I go with good\nalacrity.  I have desired a change some time; behold one offered me!\nShall I refuse?  Thank God, I am not so destitute of humour as to make a\ntragedy of such a farce.’  He flicked the order on the table.  ‘You may\nsignify my readiness,’ he added grandly.\n\n‘Ah,’ she said, ‘you are more angry than you own.’\n\n‘I, madam? angry?’ he cried.  ‘You rave!  I have no cause for anger.  In\nevery way I have been taught my weakness, my instability, and my\nunfitness for the world.  I am a plexus of weaknesses, an impotent\nPrince, a doubtful gentleman; and you yourself, indulgent as you are,\nhave twice reproved my levity.  And shall I be angry?  I may feel the\nunkindness, but I have sufficient honesty of mind to see the reasons of\nthis _coup d’état_.’\n\n‘From whom have you got this?’ she cried in wonder.  ‘You think you have\nnot behaved well?  My Prince, were you not young and handsome, I should\ndetest you for your virtues.  You push them to the verge of commonplace.\nAnd this ingratitude—’\n\n‘Understand me, Madame von Rosen,’ returned the Prince, flushing a little\ndarker, ‘there can be here no talk of gratitude, none of pride.  You are\nhere, by what circumstance I know not, but doubtless led by your\nkindness, mixed up in what regards my family alone.  You have no\nknowledge what my wife, your sovereign, may have suffered; it is not for\nyou—no, nor for me—to judge.  I own myself in fault; and were it\notherwise, a man were a very empty boaster who should talk of love and\nstart before a small humiliation.  It is in all the copybooks that one\nshould die to please his lady-love; and shall a man not go to prison?’\n\n‘Love?  And what has love to do with being sent to gaol?’ exclaimed the\nCountess, appealing to the walls and roof.  ‘Heaven knows I think as much\nof love as any one; my life would prove it; but I admit no love, at least\nfor a man, that is not equally returned.  The rest is moonshine.’\n\n‘I think of love more absolutely, madam, though I am certain no more\ntenderly, than a lady to whom I am indebted for such kindnesses,’\nreturned the Prince.  ‘But this is unavailing.  We are not here to hold a\ncourt of troubadours.’\n\n‘Still,’ she replied, ‘there is one thing you forget.  If she conspires\nwith Gondremark against your liberty, she may conspire with him against\nyour honour also.’\n\n‘My honour?’ he repeated.  ‘For a woman, you surprise me.  If I have\nfailed to gain her love or play my part of husband, what right is left\nme? or what honour can remain in such a scene of defeat?  No honour that\nI recognise.  I am become a stranger.  If my wife no longer loves me, I\nwill go to prison, since she wills it; if she love another, where should\nI be more in place? or whose fault is it but mine?  You speak, Madame von\nRosen, like too many women, with a man’s tongue.  Had I myself fallen\ninto temptation (as, Heaven knows, I might) I should have trembled, but\nstill hoped and asked for her forgiveness; and yet mine had been a\ntreason in the teeth of love.  But let me tell you, madam,’ he pursued,\nwith rising irritation, ‘where a husband by futility, facility, and\nill-timed humours has outwearied his wife’s patience, I will suffer\nneither man nor woman to misjudge her.  She is free; the man has been\nfound wanting.’\n\n‘Because she loves you not?’ the Countess cried.  ‘You know she is\nincapable of such a feeling.’\n\n‘Rather, it was I who was born incapable of inspiring it,’ said Otto.\n\nMadame von Rosen broke into sudden laughter.  ‘Fool,’ she cried, ‘I am in\nlove with you myself!’\n\n‘Ah, madam, you are most compassionate,’ the Prince retorted, smiling.\n‘But this is waste debate.  I know my purpose.  Perhaps, to equal you in\nfrankness, I know and embrace my advantage.  I am not without the spirit\nof adventure.  I am in a false position—so recognised by public\nacclamation: do you grudge me, then, my issue?’\n\n‘If your mind is made up, why should I dissuade you?’ said the Countess.\n‘I own, with a bare face, I am the gainer.  Go, you take my heart with\nyou, or more of it than I desire; I shall not sleep at night for thinking\nof your misery.  But do not be afraid; I would not spoil you, you are\nsuch a fool and hero.’\n\n‘Alas! madam,’ cried the Prince, ‘and your unlucky money!  I did amiss to\ntake it, but you are a wonderful persuader.  And I thank God, I can still\noffer you the fair equivalent.’  He took some papers from the chimney.\n‘Here, madam, are the title-deeds,’ he said; ‘where I am going, they can\ncertainly be of no use to me, and I have now no other hope of making up\nto you your kindness.  You made the loan without formality, obeying your\nkind heart.  The parts are somewhat changed; the sun of this Prince of\nGrünewald is upon the point of setting; and I know you better than to\ndoubt you will once more waive ceremony, and accept the best that he can\ngive you.  If I may look for any pleasure in the coming time, it will be\nto remember that the peasant is secure, and my most generous friend no\nloser.’\n\n‘Do you not understand my odious position?’ cried the Countess.  ‘Dear\nPrince, it is upon your fall that I begin my fortune.’\n\n‘It was the more like you to tempt me to resistance,’ returned Otto.\n‘But this cannot alter our relations; and I must, for the last time, lay\nmy commands upon you in the character of Prince.’  And with his loftiest\ndignity, he forced the deeds on her acceptance.\n\n‘I hate the very touch of them,’ she cried.\n\nThere followed upon this a little silence.  ‘At what time,’ resumed Otto,\n‘(if indeed you know) am I to be arrested?’\n\n‘Your Highness, when you please!’ exclaimed the Countess.  ‘Or, if you\nchoose to tear that paper, never!’\n\n‘I would rather it were done quickly,’ said the Prince.  ‘I shall take\nbut time to leave a letter for the Princess.’\n\n‘Well,’ said the Countess, ‘I have advised you to resist; at the same\ntime, if you intend to be dumb before your shearers, I must say that I\nought to set about arranging your arrest.  I offered’—she hesitated—‘I\noffered to manage it, intending, my dear friend—intending, upon my soul,\nto be of use to you.  Well, if you will not profit by my goodwill, then\nbe of use to me; and as soon as ever you feel ready, go to the Flying\nMercury where we met last night.  It will be none the worse for you; and\nto make it quite plain, it will be better for the rest of us.’\n\n‘Dear madam, certainly,’ said Otto.  ‘If I am prepared for the chief\nevil, I shall not quarrel with details.  Go, then, with my best\ngratitude; and when I have written a few lines of leave-taking, I shall\nimmediately hasten to keep tryst.  To-night I shall not meet so dangerous\na cavalier,’ he added, with a smiling gallantry.\n\nAs soon as Madame von Rosen was gone, he made a great call upon his\nself-command.  He was face to face with a miserable passage where, if it\nwere possible, he desired to carry himself with dignity.  As to the main\nfact, he never swerved or faltered; he had come so heart-sick and so\ncruelly humiliated from his talk with Gotthold, that he embraced the\nnotion of imprisonment with something bordering on relief.  Here was, at\nleast, a step which he thought blameless; here was a way out of his\ntroubles.  He sat down to write to Seraphina; and his anger blazed.  The\ntale of his forbearances mounted, in his eyes, to something monstrous;\nstill more monstrous, the coldness, egoism, and cruelty that had required\nand thus requited them.  The pen which he had taken shook in his hand.\nHe was amazed to find his resignation fled, but it was gone beyond his\nrecall.  In a few white-hot words, he bade adieu, dubbing desperation by\nthe name of love, and calling his wrath forgiveness; then he cast but one\nlook of leave-taking on the place that had been his for so long and was\nnow to be his no longer; and hurried forth—love’s prisoner—or pride’s.\n\nHe took that private passage which he had trodden so often in less\nmomentous hours.  The porter let him out; and the bountiful, cold air of\nthe night and the pure glory of the stars received him on the threshold.\nHe looked round him, breathing deep of earth’s plain fragrance; he looked\nup into the great array of heaven, and was quieted.  His little turgid\nlife dwindled to its true proportions; and he saw himself (that great\nflame-hearted martyr!) stand like a speck under the cool cupola of the\nnight.  Thus he felt his careless injuries already soothed; the live air\nof out-of-doors, the quiet of the world, as if by their silent music,\nsobering and dwarfing his emotions.\n\n‘Well, I forgive her,’ he said.  ‘If it be of any use to her, I forgive.’\n\nAnd with brisk steps he crossed the garden, issued upon the Park, and\ncame to the Flying Mercury.  A dark figure moved forward from the shadow\nof the pedestal.\n\n‘I have to ask your pardon, sir,’ a voice observed, ‘but if I am right in\ntaking you for the Prince, I was given to understand that you would be\nprepared to meet me.’\n\n‘Herr Gordon, I believe?’ said Otto.\n\n‘Herr Oberst Gordon,’ replied that officer.  ‘This is rather a ticklish\nbusiness for a man to be embarked in; and to find that all is to go\npleasantly is a great relief to me.  The carriage is at hand; shall I\nhave the honour of following your Highness?’\n\n‘Colonel,’ said the Prince, ‘I have now come to that happy moment of my\nlife when I have orders to receive but none to give.’\n\n‘A most philosophical remark,’ returned the Colonel.  ‘Begad, a very\npertinent remark! it might be Plutarch.  I am not a drop’s blood to your\nHighness, or indeed to any one in this principality; or else I should\ndislike my orders.  But as it is, and since there is nothing unnatural or\nunbecoming on my side, and your Highness takes it in good part, I begin\nto believe we may have a capital time together, sir—a capital time.  For\na gaoler is only a fellow-captive.’\n\n‘May I inquire, Herr Gordon,’ asked Otto, ‘what led you to accept this\ndangerous and I would fain hope thankless office?’\n\n‘Very natural, I am sure,’ replied the officer of fortune.  ‘My pay is,\nin the meanwhile, doubled.’\n\n‘Well, sir, I will not presume to criticise,’ returned the Prince.  ‘And\nI perceive the carriage.’\n\nSure enough, at the intersection of two alleys of the Park, a coach and\nfour, conspicuous by its lanterns, stood in waiting.  And a little way\noff about a score of lancers were drawn up under the shadow of the trees.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII—PROVIDENCE VON ROSEN: ACT THE THIRD\nSHE ENLIGHTENS SERAPHINA\n\n\nWhen Madame von Rosen left the Prince, she hurried straight to Colonel\nGordon; and not content with directing the arrangements, she had herself\naccompanied the soldier of fortune to the Flying Mercury.  The Colonel\ngave her his arm, and the talk between this pair of conspirators ran high\nand lively.  The Countess, indeed, was in a whirl of pleasure and\nexcitement; her tongue stumbled upon laughter, her eyes shone, the colour\nthat was usually wanting now perfected her face.  It would have taken\nlittle more to bring Gordon to her feet—or so, at least, she believed,\ndisdaining the idea.\n\nHidden among some lilac bushes, she enjoyed the great decorum of the\narrest, and heard the dialogue of the two men die away along the path.\nSoon after, the rolling of a carriage and the beat of hoofs arose in the\nstill air of the night, and passed speedily farther and fainter into\nsilence.  The Prince was gone.\n\nMadame von Rosen consulted her watch.  She had still, she thought, time\nenough for the tit-bit of her evening; and hurrying to the palace, winged\nby the fear of Gondremark’s arrival, she sent her name and a pressing\nrequest for a reception to the Princess Seraphina.  As the Countess von\nRosen unqualified, she was sure to be refused; but as an emissary of the\nBaron’s, for so she chose to style herself, she gained immediate entry.\n\nThe Princess sat alone at table, making a feint of dining.  Her cheeks\nwere mottled, her eyes heavy; she had neither slept nor eaten; even her\ndress had been neglected.  In short, she was out of health, out of looks,\nout of heart, and hag-ridden by her conscience.  The Countess drew a\nswift comparison, and shone brighter in beauty.\n\n‘You come, madam, _de la part de Monsieur le Baron_,’ drawled the\nPrincess.  ‘Be seated!  What have you to say?’\n\n‘To say?’ repeated Madame von Rosen, ‘O, much to say!  Much to say that I\nwould rather not, and much to leave unsaid that I would rather say.  For\nI am like St. Paul, your Highness, and always wish to do the things I\nshould not.  Well! to be categorical—that is the word?—I took the Prince\nyour order.  He could not credit his senses.  “Ah,” he cried “dear Madame\nvon Rosen, it is not possible—it cannot be I must hear it from your lips.\nMy wife is a poor girl misled, she is only silly, she is not cruel.”\n“_Mon Prince_,” said I, “a girl—and therefore cruel; youth kills\nflies.”—He had such pain to understand it!’\n\n‘Madame von Rosen,’ said the Princess, in most steadfast tones, but with\na rose of anger in her face, ‘who sent you here, and for what purpose?\nTell your errand.’\n\n‘O, madam, I believe you understand me very well,’ returned von Rosen.\n‘I have not your philosophy.  I wear my heart upon my sleeve, excuse the\nindecency!  It is a very little one,’ she laughed, ‘and I so often change\nthe sleeve!’\n\n‘Am I to understand the Prince has been arrested?’ asked the Princess,\nrising.\n\n‘While you sat there dining!’ cried the Countess, still nonchalantly\nseated.\n\n‘You have discharged your errand,’ was the reply; ‘I will not detain\nyou.’\n\n‘O no, madam,’ said the Countess, ‘with your permission, I have not yet\ndone.  I have borne much this evening in your service.  I have suffered.\nI was made to suffer in your service.’  She unfolded her fan as she\nspoke.  Quick as her pulses beat, the fan waved languidly.  She betrayed\nher emotion only by the brightness of her eyes and face, and by the\nalmost insolent triumph with which she looked down upon the Princess.\nThere were old scores of rivalry between them in more than one field; so\nat least von Rosen felt; and now she was to have her hour of victory in\nthem all.\n\n‘You are no servant, Madame von Rosen, of mine,’ said Seraphina.\n\n‘No, madam, indeed,’ returned the Countess; ‘but we both serve the same\nperson, as you know—or if you do not, then I have the pleasure of\ninforming you.  Your conduct is so light—so light,’ she repeated, the fan\nwavering higher like a butterfly, ‘that perhaps you do not truly\nunderstand.’  The Countess rolled her fan together, laid it in her lap,\nand rose to a less languorous position.  ‘Indeed,’ she continued, ‘I\nshould be sorry to see any young woman in your situation.  You began with\nevery advantage—birth, a suitable marriage—quite pretty too—and see what\nyou have come to!  My poor girl, to think of it!  But there is nothing\nthat does so much harm,’ observed the Countess finely, ‘as giddiness of\nmind.’  And she once more unfurled the fan, and approvingly fanned\nherself.\n\n‘I will no longer permit you to forget yourself,’ cried Seraphina.  ‘I\nthink you are mad.’\n\n‘Not mad,’ returned von Rosen.  ‘Sane enough to know you dare not break\nwith me to-night, and to profit by the knowledge.  I left my poor, pretty\nPrince Charming crying his eyes out for a wooden doll.  My heart is soft;\nI love my pretty Prince; you will never understand it, but I long to give\nmy Prince his doll, dry his poor eyes, and send him off happy.  O, you\nimmature fool!’ the Countess cried, rising to her feet, and pointing at\nthe Princess the closed fan that now began to tremble in her hand.  ‘O\nwooden doll!’ she cried, ‘have you a heart, or blood, of any nature?\nThis is a man, child—a man who loves you.  O, it will not happen twice!\nit is not common; beautiful and clever women look in vain for it.  And\nyou, you pitiful schoolgirl, tread this jewel under foot! you, stupid\nwith your vanity!  Before you try to govern kingdoms, you should first be\nable to behave yourself at home; home is the woman’s kingdom.’  She\npaused and laughed a little, strangely to hear and look upon.  ‘I will\ntell you one of the things,’ she said, ‘that were to stay unspoken.  Von\nRosen is a better women than you, my Princess, though you will never have\nthe pain of understanding it; and when I took the Prince your order, and\nlooked upon his face, my soul was melted—O, I am frank—here, within my\narms, I offered him repose!’  She advanced a step superbly as she spoke,\nwith outstretched arms; and Seraphina shrank.  ‘Do not be alarmed!’ the\nCountess cried; ‘I am not offering that hermitage to you; in all the\nworld there is but one who wants to, and him you have dismissed!  “If it\nwill give her pleasure I should wear the martyr’s crown,” he cried, “I\nwill embrace the thorns.”  I tell you—I am quite frank—I put the order in\nhis power and begged him to resist.  You, who have betrayed your husband,\nmay betray me to Gondremark; my Prince would betray no one.  Understand\nit plainly,’ she cried, ‘’tis of his pure forbearance that you sit there;\nhe had the power—I gave it him—to change the parts; and he refused, and\nwent to prison in your place.’\n\nThe Princess spoke with some distress.  ‘Your violence shocks me and\npains me,’ she began, ‘but I cannot be angry with what at least does\nhonour to the mistaken kindness of your heart: it was right for me to\nknow this.  I will condescend to tell you.  It was with deep regret that\nI was driven to this step.  I admire in many ways the Prince—I admit his\namiability.  It was our great misfortune, it was perhaps somewhat of my\nfault, that we were so unsuited to each other; but I have a regard, a\nsincere regard, for all his qualities.  As a private person I should\nthink as you do.  It is difficult, I know, to make allowances for state\nconsiderations.  I have only with deep reluctance obeyed the call of a\nsuperior duty; and so soon as I dare do it for the safety of the state, I\npromise you the Prince shall be released.  Many in my situation would\nhave resented your freedoms.  I am not’—and she looked for a moment\nrather piteously upon the Countess—‘I am not altogether so inhuman as you\nthink.’\n\n‘And you can put these troubles of the state,’ the Countess cried, ‘to\nweigh with a man’s love?’\n\n‘Madame von Rosen, these troubles are affairs of life and death to many;\nto the Prince, and perhaps even to yourself, among the number,’ replied\nthe Princess, with dignity.  ‘I have learned, madam, although still so\nyoung, in a hard school, that my own feelings must everywhere come last.’\n\n‘O callow innocence!’ exclaimed the other.  ‘Is it possible you do not\nknow, or do not suspect, the intrigue in which you move?  I find it in my\nheart to pity you!  We are both women after all—poor girl, poor girl!—and\nwho is born a woman is born a fool.  And though I hate all women—come,\nfor the common folly, I forgive you.  Your Highness’—she dropped a deep\nstage curtsey and resumed her fan—‘I am going to insult you, to betray\none who is called my lover, and if it pleases you to use the power I now\nput unreservedly into your hands, to ruin my dear self.  O what a French\ncomedy!  You betray, I betray, they betray.  It is now my cue.  The\nletter, yes.  Behold the letter, madam, its seal unbroken as I found it\nby my bed this morning; for I was out of humour, and I get many, too\nmany, of these favours.  For your own sake, for the sake of my Prince\nCharming, for the sake of this great principality that sits so heavy on\nyour conscience, open it and read!’\n\n‘Am I to understand,’ inquired the Princess, ‘that this letter in any way\nregards me?’\n\n‘You see I have not opened it,’ replied von Rosen; ‘but ’tis mine, and I\nbeg you to experiment.’\n\n‘I cannot look at it till you have,’ returned Seraphina, very seriously.\n‘There may be matter there not meant for me to see; it is a private\nletter.’\n\nThe Countess tore it open, glanced it through, and tossed it back; and\nthe Princess, taking up the sheet, recognised the hand of Gondremark, and\nread with a sickening shock the following lines:—\n\n    ‘Dearest Anna, come at once.  Ratafia has done the deed, her husband\n    is to be packed to prison.  This puts the minx entirely in my power;\n    _le tour est joué_; she will now go steady in harness, or I will know\n    the reason why.  Come.\n\n                                                                HEINRICH.’\n\n‘Command yourself, madam,’ said the Countess, watching with some alarm\nthe white face of Seraphina.  ‘It is in vain for you to fight with\nGondremark; he has more strings than mere court favour, and could bring\nyou down to-morrow with a word.  I would not have betrayed him otherwise;\nbut Heinrich is a man, and plays with all of you like marionnettes.  And\nnow at least you see for what you sacrificed my Prince.  Madam, will you\ntake some wine?  I have been cruel.’\n\n‘Not cruel, madam—salutary,’ said Seraphina, with a phantom smile.  ‘No,\nI thank you, I require no attentions.  The first surprise affected me:\nwill you give me time a little?  I must think.’\n\nShe took her head between her hands, and contemplated for a while the\nhurricane confusion of her thoughts.\n\n‘This information reaches me,’ she said, ‘when I have need of it.  I\nwould not do as you have done, but yet I thank you.  I have been much\ndeceived in Baron Gondremark.’\n\n‘O, madam, leave Gondremark, and think upon the Prince!’ cried von Rosen.\n\n‘You speak once more as a private person,’ said the Princess; ‘nor do I\nblame you.  But my own thoughts are more distracted.  However, as I\nbelieve you are truly a friend to my—to the—as I believe,’ she said, ‘you\nare a friend to Otto, I shall put the order for his release into your\nhands this moment.  Give me the ink-dish.  There!’  And she wrote\nhastily, steadying her arm upon the table, for she trembled like a reed.\n‘Remember; madam,’ she resumed, handing her the order, ‘this must not be\nused nor spoken of at present; till I have seen the Baron, any hurried\nstep—I lose myself in thinking.  The suddenness has shaken me.’\n\n‘I promise you I will not use it,’ said the Countess, ‘till you give me\nleave, although I wish the Prince could be informed of it, to comfort his\npoor heart.  And O, I had forgotten, he has left a letter.  Suffer me,\nmadam, I will bring it you.  This is the door, I think?’  And she sought\nto open it.\n\n‘The bolt is pushed,’ said Seraphina, flushing.\n\n‘O!  O!’ cried the Countess.\n\nA silence fell between them.\n\n‘I will get it for myself,’ said Seraphina; ‘and in the meanwhile I beg\nyou to leave me.  I thank you, I am sure, but I shall be obliged if you\nwill leave me.’\n\nThe Countess deeply curtseyed, and withdrew.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV—RELATES THE CAUSE AND OUTBREAK OF THE REVOLUTION\n\n\nBrave as she was, and brave by intellect, the Princess, when first she\nwas alone, clung to the table for support.  The four corners of her\nuniverse had fallen.  She had never liked nor trusted Gondremark\ncompletely; she had still held it possible to find him false to\nfriendship; but from that to finding him devoid of all those public\nvirtues for which she had honoured him, a mere commonplace intriguer,\nusing her for his own ends, the step was wide and the descent giddy.\nLight and darkness succeeded each other in her brain; now she believed,\nand now she could not.  She turned, blindly groping for the note.  But\nvon Rosen, who had not forgotten to take the warrant from the Prince, had\nremembered to recover her note from the Princess: von Rosen was an old\ncampaigner, whose most violent emotion aroused rather than clouded the\nvigour of her reason.\n\nThe thought recalled to Seraphina the remembrance of the other\nletter—Otto’s.  She rose and went speedily, her brain still wheeling, and\nburst into the Prince’s armoury.  The old chamberlain was there in\nwaiting; and the sight of another face, prying (or so she felt) on her\ndistress, struck Seraphina into childish anger.\n\n‘Go!’ she cried; and then, when the old man was already half-way to the\ndoor, ‘Stay!’ she added.  ‘As soon as Baron Gondremark arrives, let him\nattend me here.’\n\n‘It shall be so directed,’ said the chamberlain.\n\n‘There was a letter . . . ’ she began, and paused.\n\n‘Her Highness,’ said the chamberlain, ‘will, find a letter on the table.\nI had received no orders, or her Highness had been spared this trouble.’\n\n‘No, no, no,’ she cried.  ‘I thank you.  I desire to be alone.’\n\nAnd then, when he was gone, she leaped upon the letter.  Her mind was\nstill obscured; like the moon upon a night of clouds and wind, her reason\nshone and was darkened, and she read the words by flashes.\n\n    ‘Seraphina,’ the Prince wrote, ‘I will write no syllable of reproach.\n    I have seen your order, and I go.  What else is left me?  I have\n    wasted my love, and have no more.  To say that I forgive you is not\n    needful; at least, we are now separate for ever; by your own act, you\n    free me from my willing bondage: I go free to prison.  This is the\n    last that you will hear of me in love or anger.  I have gone out of\n    your life; you may breathe easy; you have now rid yourself of the\n    husband who allowed you to desert him, of the Prince who gave you his\n    rights, and of the married lover who made it his pride to defend you\n    in your absence.  How you have requited him, your own heart more\n    loudly tells you than my words.  There is a day coming when your vain\n    dreams will roll away like clouds, and you will find yourself alone.\n    Then you will remember\n\n                                                                    OTTO.’\n\nShe read with a great horror on her mind; that day, of which he wrote,\nwas come.  She was alone; she had been false, she had been cruel; remorse\nrolled in upon her; and then with a more piercing note, vanity bounded on\nthe stage of consciousness.  She a dupe! she helpless! she to have\nbetrayed herself in seeking to betray her husband! she to have lived\nthese years upon flattery, grossly swallowing the bolus, like a clown\nwith sharpers! she—Seraphina!  Her swift mind drank the consequences; she\nforesaw the coming fall, her public shame; she saw the odium, disgrace,\nand folly of her story flaunt through Europe.  She recalled the scandal\nshe had so royally braved; and alas! she had now no courage to confront\nit with.  To be thought the mistress of that man: perhaps for that. . . .\nShe closed her eyes on agonising vistas.  Swift as thought she had\nsnatched a bright dagger from the weapons that shone along the wall.  Ay,\nshe would escape.  From that world-wide theatre of nodding heads and\nbuzzing whisperers, in which she now beheld herself unpitiably martyred,\none door stood open.  At any cost, through any stress of suffering, that\ngreasy laughter should be stifled.  She closed her eyes, breathed a\nwordless prayer, and pressed the weapon to her bosom.\n\nAt the astonishing sharpness of the prick, she gave a cry and awoke to a\nsense of undeserved escape.  A little ruby spot of blood was the reward\nof that great act of desperation; but the pain had braced her like a\ntonic, and her whole design of suicide had passed away.\n\nAt the same instant regular feet drew near along the gallery, and she\nknew the tread of the big Baron, so often gladly welcome, and even now\nrallying her spirits like a call to battle.  She concealed the dagger in\nthe folds of her skirt; and drawing her stature up, she stood\nfirm-footed, radiant with anger, waiting for the foe.\n\nThe Baron was announced, and entered.  To him, Seraphina was a hated\ntask: like the schoolboy with his Virgil, he had neither will nor leisure\nto remark her beauties; but when he now beheld her standing illuminated\nby her passion, new feelings flashed upon him, a frank admiration, a\nbrief sparkle of desire.  He noted both with joy; they were means.  ‘If I\nhave to play the lover,’ thought he, for that was his constant\npreoccupation, ‘I believe I can put soul into it.’  Meanwhile, with his\nusual ponderous grace, he bent before the lady.\n\n‘I propose,’ she said in a strange voice, not known to her till then,\n‘that we release the Prince and do not prosecute the war.’\n\n‘Ah, madam,’ he replied, ‘’tis as I knew it would be!  Your heart, I\nknew, would wound you when we came to this distasteful but most necessary\nstep.  Ah, madam, believe me, I am not unworthy to be your ally; I know\nyou have qualities to which I am a stranger, and count them the best\nweapons in the armoury of our alliance:—the girl in the queen—pity, love,\ntenderness, laughter; the smile that can reward.  I can only command; I\nam the frowner.  But you!  And you have the fortitude to command these\ncomely weaknesses, to tread them down at the call of reason.  How often\nhave I not admired it even to yourself!  Ay, even to yourself,’ he added\ntenderly, dwelling, it seemed, in memory on hours of more private\nadmiration.  ‘But now, madam—’\n\n‘But now, Herr von Gondremark, the time for these declarations has gone\nby,’ she cried.  ‘Are you true to me? are you false?  Look in your heart\nand answer: it is your heart I want to know.’\n\n‘It has come,’ thought Gondremark.  ‘You, madam!’ he cried, starting\nback—with fear, you would have said, and yet a timid joy.  ‘You!\nyourself, you bid me look into my heart?’\n\n‘Do you suppose I fear?’ she cried, and looked at him with such a\nheightened colour, such bright eyes, and a smile of so abstruse a\nmeaning, that the Baron discarded his last doubt.\n\n‘Ah, madam!’ he cried, plumping on his knees.  ‘Seraphina!  Do you permit\nme? have you divined my secret?  It is true—I put my life with joy into\nyour power—I love you, love with ardour, as an equal, as a mistress, as a\nbrother-in-arms, as an adored, desired, sweet-hearted woman.  O Bride!’\nhe cried, waxing dithyrambic, ‘bride of my reason and my senses, have\npity, have pity on my love!’\n\nShe heard him with wonder, rage, and then contempt.  His words offended\nher to sickness; his appearance, as he grovelled bulkily upon the floor,\nmoved her to such laughter as we laugh in nightmares.\n\n‘O shame!’ she cried.  ‘Absurd and odious!  What would the Countess say?’\n\nThat great Baron Gondremark, the excellent politician, remained for some\nlittle time upon his knees in a frame of mind which perhaps we are\nallowed to pity.  His vanity, within his iron bosom, bled and raved.  If\nhe could have blotted all, if he could have withdrawn part, if he had not\ncalled her bride—with a roaring in his ears, he thus regretfully reviewed\nhis declaration.  He got to his feet tottering; and then, in that first\nmoment when a dumb agony finds a vent in words, and the tongue betrays\nthe inmost and worst of a man, he permitted himself a retort which, for\nsix weeks to follow, he was to repent at leisure.\n\n‘Ah,’ said he, ‘the Countess?  Now I perceive the reason of your\nHighness’s disorder.’\n\nThe lackey-like insolence of the words was driven home by a more insolent\nmanner.  There fell upon Seraphina one of those storm-clouds which had\nalready blackened upon her reason; she heard herself cry out; and when\nthe cloud dispersed, flung the blood-stained dagger on the floor, and saw\nGondremark reeling back with open mouth and clapping his hand upon the\nwound.  The next moment, with oaths that she had never heard, he leaped\nat her in savage passion; clutched her as she recoiled; and in the very\nact, stumbled and drooped.  She had scarce time to fear his murderous\nonslaught ere he fell before her feet.\n\nHe rose upon one elbow; she still staring upon him, white with horror.\n\n‘Anna!’ he cried, ‘Anna!  Help!’\n\nAnd then his utterance failed him, and he fell back, to all appearance\ndead.\n\nSeraphina ran to and fro in the room; she wrung her hands and cried\naloud; within she was all one uproar of terror, and conscious of no\narticulate wish but to awake.\n\nThere came a knocking at the door; and she sprang to it and held it,\npanting like a beast, and with the strength of madness in her arms, till\nshe had pushed the bolt.  At this success a certain calm fell upon her\nreason.  She went back and looked upon her victim, the knocking growing\nlouder.  O yes, he was dead.  She had killed him.  He had called upon von\nRosen with his latest breath; ah! who would call on Seraphina?  She had\nkilled him.  She, whose irresolute hand could scarce prick blood from her\nown bosom, had found strength to cast down that great colossus at a blow.\n\nAll this while the knocking was growing more uproarious and more unlike\nthe staid career of life in such a palace.  Scandal was at the door, with\nwhat a fatal following she dreaded to conceive; and at the same time\namong the voices that now began to summon her by name, she recognised the\nChancellor’s.  He or another, somebody must be the first.\n\n‘Is Herr von Greisengesang without?’ she called.\n\n‘Your Highness—yes!’ the old gentleman answered.  ‘We have heard cries, a\nfall.  Is anything amiss?’\n\n‘Nothing,’ replied Seraphina ‘I desire to speak with you.  Send off the\nrest.’  She panted between each phrase; but her mind was clear.  She let\nthe looped curtain down upon both sides before she drew the bolt; and,\nthus secure from any sudden eyeshot from without, admitted the obsequious\nChancellor, and again made fast the door.\n\nGreisengesang clumsily revolved among the wings of the curtain, so that\nshe was clear of it as soon as he.\n\n‘My God!’ he cried ‘The Baron!’\n\n‘I have killed him,’ she said.  ‘O, killed him!’\n\n‘Dear me,’ said the old gentleman, ‘this is most unprecedented.  Lovers’\nquarrels,’ he added ruefully, ‘redintegratio—’ and then paused.  ‘But, my\ndear madam,’ he broke out again, ‘in the name of all that is practical,\nwhat are we to do?  This is exceedingly grave; morally, madam, it is\nappalling.  I take the liberty, your Highness, for one moment, of\naddressing you as a daughter, a loved although respected daughter; and I\nmust say that I cannot conceal from you that this is morally most\nquestionable.  And, O dear me, we have a dead body!’\n\nShe had watched him closely; hope fell to contempt; she drew away her\nskirts from his weakness, and, in the act, her own strength returned to\nher.\n\n‘See if he be dead,’ she said; not one word of explanation or defence;\nshe had scorned to justify herself before so poor a creature: ‘See if he\nbe dead’ was all.\n\nWith the greatest compunction, the Chancellor drew near; and as he did so\nthe wounded Baron rolled his eyes.\n\n‘He lives,’ cried the old courtier, turning effusively to Seraphina.\n‘Madam, he still lives.’\n\n‘Help him, then,’ returned the Princess, standing fixed.  ‘Bind up his\nwound.’\n\n‘Madam, I have no means,’ protested the Chancellor.\n\n‘Can you not take your handkerchief, your neck-cloth, anything?’ she\ncried; and at the same moment, from her light muslin gown she rent off a\nflounce and tossed it on the floor.  ‘Take that,’ she said, and for the\nfirst time directly faced Greisengesang.\n\nBut the Chancellor held up his hands and turned away his head in agony.\nThe grasp of the falling Baron had torn down the dainty fabric of the\nbodice; and—‘O Highness!’ cried Greisengesang, appalled, ‘the terrible\ndisorder of your toilette!’\n\n‘Take up that flounce,’ she said; ‘the man may die.’\n\nGreisengesang turned in a flutter to the Baron, and attempted some\ninnocent and bungling measures.  ‘He still breathes,’ he kept saying.\n‘All is not yet over; he is not yet gone.’\n\n‘And now,’ said she ‘if that is all you can do, begone and get some\nporters; he must instantly go home.’\n\n‘Madam,’ cried the Chancellor, ‘if this most melancholy sight were seen\nin town—O dear, the State would fall!’ he piped.\n\n‘There is a litter in the Palace,’ she replied.  ‘It is your part to see\nhim safe.  I lay commands upon you.  On your life it stands.’\n\n‘I see it, dear Highness,’ he jerked.  ‘Clearly I see it.  But how? what\nmen?  The Prince’s servants—yes.  They had a personal affection.  They\nwill be true, if any.’\n\n‘O, not them!’ she cried.  ‘Take Sabra, my own man.’\n\n‘Sabra!  The grand-mason?’ returned the Chancellor, aghast.  ‘If he but\nsaw this, he would sound the tocsin—we should all be butchered.’\n\nShe measured the depth of her abasement steadily.  ‘Take whom you must,’\nshe said, ‘and bring the litter here.’\n\nOnce she was alone she ran to the Baron, and with a sickening heart\nsought to allay the flux of blood.  The touch of the skin of that great\ncharlatan revolted her to the toes; the wound, in her ignorant eyes,\nlooked deathly; yet she contended with her shuddering, and, with more\nskill at least than the Chancellor’s, staunched the welling injury.  An\neye unprejudiced with hate would have admired the Baron in his swoon; he\nlooked so great and shapely; it was so powerful a machine that lay\narrested; and his features, cleared for the moment both of temper and\ndissimulation, were seen to be so purely modelled.  But it was not thus\nwith Seraphina.  Her victim, as he lay outspread, twitching a little, his\nbig chest unbared, fixed her with his ugliness; and her mind flitted for\na glimpse to Otto.\n\nRumours began to sound about the Palace of feet running and of voices\nraised; the echoes of the great arched staircase were voluble of some\nconfusion; and then the gallery jarred with a quick and heavy tramp.  It\nwas the Chancellor, followed by four of Otto’s valets and a litter.  The\nservants, when they were admitted, stared at the dishevelled Princess and\nthe wounded man; speech was denied them, but their thoughts were riddled\nwith profanity.  Gondremark was bundled in; the curtains of the litter\nwere lowered; the bearers carried it forth, and the Chancellor followed\nbehind with a white face.\n\nSeraphina ran to the window.  Pressing her face upon the pane, she could\nsee the terrace, where the lights contended; thence, the avenue of lamps\nthat joined the Palace and town; and overhead the hollow night and the\nlarger stars.  Presently the small procession issued from the Palace,\ncrossed the parade, and began to thread the glittering alley: the\nswinging couch with its four porters, the much-pondering Chancellor\nbehind.  She watched them dwindle with strange thoughts: her eyes fixed\nupon the scene, her mind still glancing right and left on the overthrow\nof her life and hopes.  There was no one left in whom she might confide;\nnone whose hand was friendly, or on whom she dared to reckon for the\nbarest loyalty.  With the fall of Gondremark, her party, her brief\npopularity, had fallen.  So she sat crouched upon the window-seat, her\nbrow to the cool pane; her dress in tatters, barely shielding her; her\nmind revolving bitter thoughts.\n\nMeanwhile, consequences were fast mounting; and in the deceptive quiet of\nthe night, downfall and red revolt were brewing.  The litter had passed\nforth between the iron gates and entered on the streets of the town.  By\nwhat flying panic, by what thrill of air communicated, who shall say? but\nthe passing bustle in the Palace had already reached and re-echoed in the\nregion of the burghers.  Rumour, with her loud whisper, hissed about the\ntown; men left their homes without knowing why; knots formed along the\nboulevard; under the rare lamps and the great limes the crowd grew\nblacker.\n\nAnd now through the midst of that expectant company, the unusual sight of\na closed litter was observed approaching, and trotting hard behind it\nthat great dignitary Cancellarius Greisengesang.  Silence looked on as it\nwent by; and as soon as it was passed, the whispering seethed over like a\nboiling pot.  The knots were sundered; and gradually, one following\nanother, the whole mob began to form into a procession and escort the\ncurtained litter.  Soon spokesmen, a little bolder than their mates,\nbegan to ply the Chancellor with questions.  Never had he more need of\nthat great art of falsehood, by whose exercise he had so richly lived.\nAnd yet now he stumbled, the master passion, fear, betraying him.  He was\npressed; he became incoherent; and then from the jolting litter came a\ngroan.  In the instant hubbub and the gathering of the crowd as to a\nnatural signal, the clear-eyed quavering Chancellor heard the catch of\nthe clock before it strikes the hour of doom; and for ten seconds he\nforgot himself.  This shall atone for many sins.  He plucked a bearer by\nthe sleeve.  ‘Bid the Princess flee.  All is lost,’ he whispered.  And\nthe next moment he was babbling for his life among the multitude.\n\nFive minutes later the wild-eyed servant burst into the armoury.  ‘All is\nlost!’ he cried.  ‘The Chancellor bids you flee.’  And at the same time,\nlooking through the window, Seraphina saw the black rush of the populace\nbegin to invade the lamplit avenue.\n\n‘Thank you, Georg,’ she said.  ‘I thank you.  Go.’  And as the man still\nlingered, ‘I bid you go,’ she added.  ‘Save yourself.’\n\nDown by the private passage, and just some two hours later, Amalia\nSeraphina, the last Princess, followed Otto Johann Friedrich, the last\nPrince of Grünewald.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III—FORTUNATE MISFORTUNE\n\n\nCHAPTER I—PRINCESS CINDERELLA\n\n\nThe porter, drawn by the growing turmoil, had vanished from the postern,\nand the door stood open on the darkness of the night.  As Seraphina fled\nup the terraces, the cries and loud footing of the mob drew nearer the\ndoomed palace; the rush was like the rush of cavalry; the sound of\nshattering lamps tingled above the rest; and, overtowering all, she heard\nher own name bandied among the shouters.  A bugle sounded at the door of\nthe guard-room; one gun was fired; and then with the yell of hundreds,\nMittwalden Palace was carried at a rush.\n\nSped by these dire sounds and voices, the Princess scaled the long\ngarden, skimming like a bird the starlit stairways; crossed the Park,\nwhich was in that place narrow; and plunged upon the farther side into\nthe rude shelter of the forest.  So, at a bound, she left the discretion\nand the cheerful lamps of Palace evenings; ceased utterly to be a\nsovereign lady; and, falling from the whole height of civilisation, ran\nforth into the woods, a ragged Cinderella.\n\nShe went direct before her through an open tract of the forest, full of\nbrush and birches, and where the starlight guided her; and, beyond that\nagain, must thread the columned blackness of a pine grove joining\noverhead the thatch of its long branches.  At that hour the place was\nbreathless; a horror of night like a presence occupied that dungeon of\nthe wood; and she went groping, knocking against the boles—her ear,\nbetweenwhiles, strained to aching and yet unrewarded.\n\nBut the slope of the ground was upward, and encouraged her; and presently\nshe issued on a rocky hill that stood forth above the sea of forest.  All\naround were other hill-tops, big and little; sable vales of forest\nbetween; overhead the open heaven and the brilliancy of countless stars;\nand along the western sky the dim forms of mountains.  The glory of the\ngreat night laid hold upon her; her eyes shone with stars; she dipped her\nsight into the coolness and brightness of the sky, as she might have\ndipped her wrist into a spring; and her heart, at that ethereal shock,\nbegan to move more soberly.  The sun that sails overhead, ploughing into\ngold the fields of daylight azure and uttering the signal to man’s\nmyriads, has no word apart for man the individual; and the moon, like a\nviolin, only praises and laments our private destiny.  The stars alone,\ncheerful whisperers, confer quietly with each of us like friends; they\ngive ear to our sorrows smilingly, like wise old men, rich in tolerance;\nand by their double scale, so small to the eye, so vast to the\nimagination, they keep before the mind the double character of man’s\nnature and fate.\n\nThere sat the Princess, beautifully looking upon beauty, in council with\nthese glad advisers.  Bright like pictures, clear like a voice in the\nporches of her ear, memory re-enacted the tumult of the evening: the\nCountess and the dancing fan, the big Baron on his knees, the blood on\nthe polished floor, the knocking, the swing of the litter down the avenue\nof lamps, the messenger, the cries of the charging mob; and yet all were\nfar away and phantasmal, and she was still healingly conscious of the\npeace and glory of the night.  She looked towards Mittwalden; and above\nthe hill-top, which already hid it from her view, a throbbing redness\nhinted of fire.  Better so: better so, that she should fall with tragic\ngreatness, lit by a blazing palace!  She felt not a trace of pity for\nGondremark or of concern for Grünewald: that period of her life was\nclosed for ever, a wrench of wounded vanity alone surviving.  She had but\none clear idea: to flee;—and another, obscure and half-rejected, although\nstill obeyed: to flee in the direction of the Felsenburg.  She had a duty\nto perform, she must free Otto—so her mind said, very coldly; but her\nheart embraced the notion of that duty even with ardour, and her hands\nbegan to yearn for the grasp of kindness.\n\nShe rose, with a start of recollection, and plunged down the slope into\nthe covert.  The woods received and closed upon her.  Once more, she\nwandered and hasted in a blot, uncheered, unpiloted.  Here and there,\nindeed, through rents in the wood-roof, a glimmer attracted her; here and\nthere a tree stood out among its neighbours by some force of outline;\nhere and there a brushing among the leaves, a notable blackness, a dim\nshine, relieved, only to exaggerate, the solid oppression of the night\nand silence.  And betweenwhiles, the unfeatured darkness would redouble\nand the whole ear of night appear to be gloating on her steps.  Now she\nwould stand still, and the silence, would grow and grow, till it weighed\nupon her breathing; and then she would address herself again to run,\nstumbling, falling, and still hurrying the more.  And presently the whole\nwood rocked and began to run along with her.  The noise of her own mad\npassage through the silence spread and echoed, and filled the night with\nterror.  Panic hunted her: Panic from the trees reached forth with\nclutching branches; the darkness was lit up and peopled with strange\nforms and faces.  She strangled and fled before her fears.  And yet in\nthe last fortress, reason, blown upon by these gusts of terror, still\nshone with a troubled light.  She knew, yet could not act upon her\nknowledge; she knew that she must stop, and yet she still ran.\n\nShe was already near madness, when she broke suddenly into a narrow\nclearing.  At the same time the din grew louder, and she became conscious\nof vague forms and fields of whiteness.  And with that the earth gave\nway; she fell and found her feet again with an incredible shock to her\nsenses, and her mind was swallowed up.\n\nWhen she came again to herself, she was standing to the mid-leg in an icy\neddy of a brook, and leaning with one hand on the rock from which it\npoured.  The spray had wet her hair.  She saw the white cascade, the\nstars wavering in the shaken pool, foam flitting, and high overhead the\ntall pines on either hand serenely drinking starshine; and in the sudden\nquiet of her spirit she heard with joy the firm plunge of the cataract in\nthe pool.  She scrambled forth dripping.  In the face of her proved\nweakness, to adventure again upon the horror of blackness in the groves\nwere a suicide of life or reason.  But here, in the alley of the brook,\nwith the kind stars above her, and the moon presently swimming into\nsight, she could await the coming of day without alarm.\n\nThis lane of pine-trees ran very rapidly down-hill and wound among the\nwoods; but it was a wider thoroughfare than the brook needed, and here\nand there were little dimpling lawns and coves of the forest, where the\nstarshine slumbered.  Such a lawn she paced, taking patience bravely; and\nnow she looked up the hill and saw the brook coming down to her in a\nseries of cascades; and now approached the margin, where it welled among\nthe rushes silently; and now gazed at the great company of heaven with an\nenduring wonder.  The early evening had fallen chill, but the night was\nnow temperate; out of the recesses of the wood there came mild airs as\nfrom a deep and peaceful breathing; and the dew was heavy on the grass\nand the tight-shut daisies.  This was the girl’s first night under the\nnaked heaven; and now that her fears were overpast, she was touched to\nthe soul by its serene amenity and peace.  Kindly the host of heaven\nblinked down upon that wandering Princess; and the honest brook had no\nwords but to encourage her.\n\nAt last she began to be aware of a wonderful revolution, compared to\nwhich the fire of Mittwalden Palace was but the crack and flash of a\npercussion-cap.  The countenance with which the pines regarded her began\ninsensibly to change; the grass too, short as it was, and the whole\nwinding staircase of the brook’s course, began to wear a solemn freshness\nof appearance.  And this slow transfiguration reached her heart, and\nplayed upon it, and transpierced it with a serious thrill.  She looked\nall about; the whole face of nature looked back, brimful of meaning,\nfinger on lip, leaking its glad secret.  She looked up.  Heaven was\nalmost emptied of stars.  Such as still lingered shone with a changed and\nwaning brightness, and began to faint in their stations.  And the colour\nof the sky itself was the most wonderful; for the rich blue of the night\nhad now melted and softened and brightened; and there had succeeded in\nits place a hue that has no name, and that is never seen but as the\nherald of morning.  ‘O!’ she cried, joy catching at her voice, ‘O! it is\nthe dawn!’\n\nIn a breath she passed over the brook, and looped up her skirts and\nfairly ran in the dim alleys.  As she ran, her ears were aware of many\npipings, more beautiful than music; in the small dish-shaped houses in\nthe fork of giant arms, where they had lain all night, lover by lover,\nwarmly pressed, the bright-eyed, big-hearted singers began to awaken for\nthe day.  Her heart melted and flowed forth to them in kindness.  And\nthey, from their small and high perches in the clerestories of the wood\ncathedral, peered down sidelong at the ragged Princess as she flitted\nbelow them on the carpet of the moss and tassel.\n\nSoon she had struggled to a certain hill-top, and saw far before her the\nsilent inflooding of the day.  Out of the East it welled and whitened;\nthe darkness trembled into light; and the stars were extinguished like\nthe street-lamps of a human city.  The whiteness brightened into silver,\nthe silver warmed into gold, the gold kindled into pure and living fire;\nand the face of the East was barred with elemental scarlet.  The day drew\nits first long breath, steady and chill; and for leagues around the woods\nsighed and shivered.  And then, at one bound, the sun had floated up; and\nher startled eyes received day’s first arrow, and quailed under the\nbuffet.  On every side, the shadows leaped from their ambush and fell\nprone.  The day was come, plain and garish; and up the steep and solitary\neastern heaven, the sun, victorious over his competitors, continued\nslowly and royally to mount.\n\nSeraphina drooped for a little, leaning on a pine, the shrill joy of the\nwoodlands mocking her.  The shelter of the night, the thrilling and\njoyous changes of the dawn, were over; and now, in the hot eye of the\nday, she turned uneasily and looked sighingly about her.  Some way off\namong the lower woods, a pillar of smoke was mounting and melting in the\ngold and blue.  There, surely enough, were human folk, the\nhearth-surrounders.  Man’s fingers had laid the twigs; it was man’s\nbreath that had quickened and encouraged the baby flames; and now, as the\nfire caught, it would be playing ruddily on the face of its creator.  At\nthe thought, she felt a-cold and little and lost in that great\nout-of-doors.  The electric shock of the young sun-beams and the unhuman\nbeauty of the woods began to irk and daunt her.  The covert of the house,\nthe decent privacy of rooms, the swept and regulated fire, all that\ndenotes or beautifies the home life of man, began to draw her as with\ncords.  The pillar of smoke was now risen into some stream of moving air;\nit began to lean out sideways in a pennon; and thereupon, as though the\nchange had been a summons, Seraphina plunged once more into the labyrinth\nof the wood.\n\nShe left day upon the high ground.  In the lower groves there still\nlingered the blue early twilight and the seizing freshness of the dew.\nBut here and there, above this field of shadow, the head of a great\noutspread pine was already glorious with day; and here and there, through\nthe breaches of the hills, the sun-beams made a great and luminous entry.\nHere Seraphina hastened along forest paths.  She had lost sight of the\npilot smoke, which blew another way, and conducted herself in that great\nwilderness by the direction of the sun.  But presently fresh signs\nbespoke the neighbourhood of man; felled trunks, white slivers from the\naxe, bundles of green boughs, and stacks of firewood.  These guided her\nforward; until she came forth at last upon the clearing whence the smoke\narose.  A hut stood in the clear shadow, hard by a brook which made a\nseries of inconsiderable falls; and on the threshold the Princess saw a\nsun-burnt and hard-featured woodman, standing with his hands behind his\nback and gazing skyward.\n\nShe went to him directly: a beautiful, bright-eyed, and haggard vision;\nsplendidly arrayed and pitifully tattered; the diamond ear-drops still\nglittering in her ears; and with the movement of her coming, one small\nbreast showing and hiding among the ragged covert of the laces.  At that\nambiguous hour, and coming as she did from the great silence of the\nforest, the man drew back from the Princess as from something elfin.\n\n‘I am cold,’ she said, ‘and weary.  Let me rest beside your fire.’\n\nThe woodman was visibly commoved, but answered nothing.\n\n‘I will pay,’ she said, and then repented of the words, catching perhaps\na spark of terror from his frightened eyes.  But, as usual, her courage\nrekindled brighter for the check.  She put him from the door and entered;\nand he followed her in superstitious wonder.\n\nWithin, the hut was rough and dark; but on the stone that served as\nhearth, twigs and a few dry branches burned with the brisk sounds and all\nthe variable beauty of fire.  The very sight of it composed her; she\ncrouched hard by on the earth floor and shivered in the glow, and looked\nupon the eating blaze with admiration.  The woodman was still staring at\nhis guest: at the wreck of the rich dress, the bare arms, the bedraggled\nlaces and the gems.  He found no word to utter.\n\n‘Give me food,’ said she,—‘here, by the fire.’\n\nHe set down a pitcher of coarse wine, bread, a piece of cheese, and a\nhandful of raw onions.  The bread was hard and sour, the cheese like\nleather; even the onion, which ranks with the truffle and the nectarine\nin the chief place of honour of earth’s fruits, is not perhaps a dish for\nprincesses when raw.  But she ate, if not with appetite, with courage;\nand when she had eaten, did not disdain the pitcher.  In all her life\nbefore, she had not tasted of gross food nor drunk after another; but a\nbrave woman far more readily accepts a change of circumstances than the\nbravest man.  All that while, the woodman continued to observe her\nfurtively, many low thoughts of fear and greed contending in his eyes.\nShe read them clearly, and she knew she must begone.\n\nPresently she arose and offered him a florin.\n\n‘Will that repay you?’ she asked.\n\nBut here the man found his tongue.  ‘I must have more than that,’ said\nhe.\n\n‘It is all I have to give you,’ she returned, and passed him by serenely.\n\nYet her heart trembled, for she saw his hand stretched forth as if to\narrest her, and his unsteady eyes wandering to his axe.  A beaten path\nled westward from the clearing, and she swiftly followed it.  She did not\nglance behind her.  But as soon as the least turning of the path had\nconcealed her from the woodman’s eyes, she slipped among the trees and\nran till she deemed herself in safety.\n\nBy this time the strong sunshine pierced in a thousand places the\npine-thatch of the forest, fired the red boles, irradiated the cool\naisles of shadow, and burned in jewels on the grass.  The gum of these\ntrees was dearer to the senses than the gums of Araby; each pine, in the\nlusty morning sunlight, burned its own wood-incense; and now and then a\nbreeze would rise and toss these rooted censers, and send shade and\nsun-gem flitting, swift as swallows, thick as bees; and wake a brushing\nbustle of sounds that murmured and went by.\n\nOn she passed, and up and down, in sun and shadow; now aloft on the bare\nridge among the rocks and birches, with the lizards and the snakes; and\nanon in the deep grove among sunless pillars.  Now she followed wandering\nwood-paths, in the maze of valleys; and again, from a hill-top, beheld\nthe distant mountains and the great birds circling under the sky.  She\nwould see afar off a nestling hamlet, and go round to avoid it.  Below,\nshe traced the course of the foam of mountain torrents.  Nearer hand, she\nsaw where the tender springs welled up in silence, or oozed in green\nmoss; or in the more favoured hollows a whole family of infant rivers\nwould combine, and tinkle in the stones, and lie in pools to be a\nbathing-place for sparrows, or fall from the sheer rock in rods of\ncrystal.  Upon all these things, as she still sped along in the bright\nair, she looked with a rapture of surprise and a joyful fainting of the\nheart; they seemed so novel, they touched so strangely home, they were so\nhued and scented, they were so beset and canopied by the dome of the blue\nair of heaven.\n\nAt length, when she was well weary, she came upon a wide and shallow\npool.  Stones stood in it, like islands; bulrushes fringed the coast; the\nfloor was paved with the pine needles; and the pines themselves, whose\nroots made promontories, looked down silently on their green images.  She\ncrept to the margin and beheld herself with wonder, a hollow and\nbright-eyed phantom, in the ruins of her palace robe.  The breeze now\nshook her image; now it would be marred with flies; and at that she\nsmiled; and from the fading circles, her counterpart smiled back to her\nand looked kind.  She sat long in the warm sun, and pitied her bare arms\nthat were all bruised and marred with falling, and marvelled to see that\nshe was dirty, and could not grow to believe that she had gone so long in\nsuch a strange disorder.\n\nThen, with a sigh, she addressed herself to make a toilette by that\nforest mirror, washed herself pure from all the stains of her adventure,\ntook off her jewels and wrapped them in her handkerchief, re-arranged the\ntatters of her dress, and took down the folds of her hair.  She shook it\nround her face, and the pool repeated her thus veiled.  Her hair had\nsmelt like violets, she remembered Otto saying; and so now she tried to\nsmell it, and then shook her head, and laughed a little, sadly, to\nherself.\n\nThe laugh was returned upon her in a childish echo.\n\nShe looked up; and lo! two children looking on,—a small girl and a yet\nsmaller boy, standing, like playthings, by the pool, below a spreading\npine.  Seraphina was not fond of children, and now she was startled to\nthe heart.\n\n‘Who are you?’ she cried hoarsely.\n\nThe mites huddled together and drew back; and Seraphina’s heart\nreproached her that she should have frightened things so quaint and\nlittle, and yet alive with senses.  She thought upon the birds and looked\nagain at her two visitors; so little larger and so far more innocent.  On\ntheir clear faces, as in a pool, she saw the reflection of their fears.\nWith gracious purpose she arose.\n\n‘Come,’ she said, ‘do not be afraid of me,’ and took a step towards them.\n\nBut alas! at the first moment, the two poor babes in the wood turned and\nran helter-skelter from the Princess.\n\nThe most desolate pang was struck into the girl’s heart.  Here she was,\ntwenty-two—soon twenty-three—and not a creature loved her; none but Otto;\nand would even he forgive?  If she began weeping in these woods alone, it\nwould mean death or madness.  Hastily she trod the thoughts out like a\nburning paper; hastily rolled up her locks, and with terror dogging her,\nand her whole bosom sick with grief, resumed her journey.\n\nPast ten in the forenoon, she struck a high-road, marching in that place\nuphill between two stately groves, a river of sunlight; and here, dead\nweary, careless of consequences, and taking some courage from the human\nand civilised neighbourhood of the road, she stretched herself on the\ngreen margin in the shadow of a tree.  Sleep closed on her, at first with\na horror of fainting, but when she ceased to struggle, kindly embracing\nher.  So she was taken home for a little, from all her toils and sorrows,\nto her Father’s arms.  And there in the meanwhile her body lay exposed by\nthe highwayside, in tattered finery; and on either hand from the woods\nthe birds came flying by and calling upon others, and debated in their\nown tongue this strange appearance.\n\nThe sun pursued his journey; the shadow flitted from her feet, shrank\nhigher and higher, and was upon the point of leaving her altogether, when\nthe rumble of a coach was signalled to and fro by the birds.  The road in\nthat part was very steep; the rumble drew near with great deliberation;\nand ten minutes passed before a gentleman appeared, walking with a sober\nelderly gait upon the grassy margin of the highway, and looking\npleasantly around him as he walked.  From time to time he paused, took\nout his note-book and made an entry with a pencil; and any spy who had\nbeen near enough would have heard him mumbling words as though he were a\npoet testing verses.  The voice of the wheels was still faint, and it was\nplain the traveller had far outstripped his carriage.\n\nHe had drawn very near to where the Princess lay asleep, before his eye\nalighted on her; but when it did he started, pocketed his note-book, and\napproached.  There was a milestone close to where she lay; and he sat\ndown on that and coolly studied her.  She lay upon one side, all curled\nand sunken, her brow on one bare arm, the other stretched out, limp and\ndimpled.  Her young body, like a thing thrown down, had scarce a mark of\nlife.  Her breathing stirred her not.  The deadliest fatigue was thus\nconfessed in every language of the sleeping flesh.  The traveller smiled\ngrimly.  As though he had looked upon a statue, he made a grudging\ninventory of her charms: the figure in that touching freedom of\nforgetfulness surprised him; the flush of slumber became her like a\nflower.\n\n‘Upon my word,’ he thought, ‘I did not think the girl could be so pretty.\nAnd to think,’ he added, ‘that I am under obligation not to use one word\nof this!’  He put forth his stick and touched her; and at that she awoke,\nsat up with a cry, and looked upon him wildly.\n\n‘I trust your Highness has slept well,’ he said, nodding.\n\nBut she only uttered sounds.\n\n‘Compose yourself,’ said he, giving her certainly a brave example in his\nown demeanour.  ‘My chaise is close at hand; and I shall have, I trust,\nthe singular entertainment of abducting a sovereign Princess.’\n\n‘Sir John!’ she said, at last.\n\n‘At your Highness’s disposal,’ he replied.\n\nShe sprang to her feet.  ‘O!’ she cried, ‘have you come from Mittwalden?’\n\n‘This morning,’ he returned, ‘I left it; and if there is any one less\nlikely to return to it than yourself, behold him!’\n\n‘The Baron—’ she began, and paused.\n\n‘Madam,’ he answered, ‘it was well meant, and you are quite a Judith; but\nafter the hours that have elapsed, you will probably be relieved to hear\nthat he is fairly well.  I took his news this morning ere I left.  Doing\nfairly well, they said, but suffering acutely.  Hey?—acutely.  They could\nhear his groans in the next room.’\n\n‘And the Prince,’ she asked, ‘is anything known of him?’\n\n‘It is reported,’ replied Sir John, with the same pleasurable\ndeliberation, ‘that upon that point your Highness is the best authority.’\n\n‘Sir John,’ she said eagerly, ‘you were generous enough to speak about\nyour carriage.  Will you, I beseech you, will you take me to the\nFelsenburg?  I have business there of an extreme importance.’\n\n‘I can refuse you nothing,’ replied the old gentleman, gravely and\nseriously enough.  ‘Whatever, madam, it is in my power to do for you,\nthat shall be done with pleasure.  As soon as my chaise shall overtake\nus, it is yours to carry you where you will.  But,’ added he, reverting\nto his former manner, ‘I observe you ask me nothing of the Palace.’\n\n‘I do not care,’ she said.  ‘I thought I saw it burning.’\n\n‘Prodigious!’ said the Baronet.  ‘You thought?  And can the loss of forty\ntoilettes leave you cold?  Well, madam, I admire your fortitude.  And the\nstate, too?  As I left, the government was sitting,—the new government,\nof which at least two members must be known to you by name: Sabra, who\nhad, I believe, the benefit of being formed in your employment—a footman,\nam I right?—and our old friend the Chancellor, in something of a\nsubaltern position.  But in these convulsions the last shall be first,\nand the first last.’\n\n‘Sir John,’ she said, with an air of perfect honesty, ‘I am sure you mean\nmost kindly, but these matters have no interest for me.’\n\nThe Baronet was so utterly discountenanced that he hailed the appearance\nof his chaise with welcome, and, by way of saying something, proposed\nthat they should walk back to meet it.  So it was done; and he helped her\nin with courtesy, mounted to her side, and from various receptacles (for\nthe chaise was most completely fitted out) produced fruits and truffled\nliver, beautiful white bread, and a bottle of delicate wine.  With these\nhe served her like a father, coaxing and praising her to fresh exertions;\nand during all that time, as though silenced by the laws of hospitality,\nhe was not guilty of the shadow of a sneer.  Indeed his kindness seemed\nso genuine that Seraphina was moved to gratitude.\n\n‘Sir John,’ she said, ‘you hate me in your heart; why are you so kind to\nme?’\n\n‘Ah, my good lady,’ said he, with no disclaimer of the accusation, ‘I\nhave the honour to be much your husband’s friend, and somewhat his\nadmirer.’\n\n‘You!’ she cried.  ‘They told me you wrote cruelly of both of us.’\n\n‘Such was the strange path by which we grew acquainted,’ said Sir John.\n‘I had written, madam, with particular cruelty (since that shall be the\nphrase) of your fair self.  Your husband set me at liberty, gave me a\npassport, ordered a carriage, and then, with the most boyish spirit,\nchallenged me to fight.  Knowing the nature of his married life, I\nthought the dash and loyalty he showed delightful.  “Do not be afraid,”\nsays he; “if I am killed, there is nobody to miss me.”  It appears you\nsubsequently thought of that yourself.  But I digress.  I explained to\nhim it was impossible that I could fight!  “Not if I strike you?” says\nhe.  Very droll; I wish I could have put it in my book.  However, I was\nconquered, took the young gentleman to my high favour, and tore up my\nbits of scandal on the spot.  That is one of the little favours, madam,\nthat you owe your husband.’\n\nSeraphina sat for some while in silence.  She could bear to be misjudged\nwithout a pang by those whom she contemned; she had none of Otto’s\neagerness to be approved, but went her own way straight and head in air.\nTo Sir John, however, after what he had said, and as her husband’s\nfriend, she was prepared to stoop.\n\n‘What do you think of me?’ she asked abruptly.\n\n‘I have told you already,’ said Sir John: ‘I think you want another glass\nof my good wine.’\n\n‘Come,’ she said, ‘this is unlike you.  You are not wont to be afraid.\nYou say that you admire my husband: in his name, be honest.’\n\n‘I admire your courage,’ said the Baronet.  ‘Beyond that, as you have\nguessed, and indeed said, our natures are not sympathetic.’\n\n‘You spoke of scandal,’ pursued Seraphina.  ‘Was the scandal great?’\n\n‘It was considerable,’ said Sir John.\n\n‘And you believed it?’ she demanded.\n\n‘O, madam,’ said Sir John, ‘the question!’\n\n‘Thank you for that answer!’ cried Seraphina.  ‘And now here, I will tell\nyou, upon my honour, upon my soul, in spite of all the scandal in this\nworld, I am as true a wife as ever stood.’\n\n‘We should probably not agree upon a definition,’ observed Sir John.\n\n‘O!’ she cried, ‘I have abominably used him—I know that; it is not that I\nmean.  But if you admire my husband, I insist that you shall understand\nme: I can look him in the face without a blush.’\n\n‘It may be, madam,’ said Sir John; ‘nor have I presumed to think the\ncontrary.’\n\n‘You will not believe me?’ she cried.  ‘You think I am a guilty wife?\nYou think he was my lover?’\n\n‘Madam,’ returned the Baronet, ‘when I tore up my papers, I promised your\ngood husband to concern myself no more with your affairs; and I assure\nyou for the last time that I have no desire to judge you.’\n\n‘But you will not acquit me!  Ah!’ she cried, ‘_he_ will—he knows me\nbetter!’\n\nSir John smiled.\n\n‘You smile at my distress?’ asked Seraphina.\n\n‘At your woman’s coolness,’ said Sir John.  ‘A man would scarce have had\nthe courage of that cry, which was, for all that, very natural, and I\nmake no doubt quite true.  But remark, madam—since you do me the honour\nto consult me gravely—I have no pity for what you call your distresses.\nYou have been completely selfish, and now reap the consequence.  Had you\nonce thought of your husband, instead of singly thinking of yourself, you\nwould not now have been alone, a fugitive, with blood upon your hands,\nand hearing from a morose old Englishman truth more bitter than scandal.’\n\n‘I thank you,’ she said, quivering.  ‘This is very true.  Will you stop\nthe carriage?’\n\n‘No, child,’ said Sir John, ‘not until I see you mistress of yourself.’\n\nThere was a long pause, during which the carriage rolled by rock and\nwoodland.\n\n‘And now,’ she resumed, with perfect steadiness, ‘will you consider me\ncomposed?  I request you, as a gentleman, to let me out.’\n\n‘I think you do unwisely,’ he replied.  ‘Continue, if you please, to use\nmy carriage.’\n\n‘Sir John,’ she said, ‘if death were sitting on that pile of stones, I\nwould alight!  I do not blame, I thank you; I now know how I appear to\nothers; but sooner than draw breath beside a man who can so think of me,\nI would—O!’ she cried, and was silent.\n\nSir John pulled the string, alighted, and offered her his hand; but she\nrefused the help.\n\nThe road had now issued from the valleys in which it had been winding,\nand come to that part of its course where it runs, like a cornice, along\nthe brow of the steep northward face of Grünewald.  The place where they\nhad alighted was at a salient angle; a bold rock and some wind-tortured\npine-trees overhung it from above; far below the blue plains lay forth\nand melted into heaven; and before them the road, by a succession of bold\nzigzags, was seen mounting to where a tower upon a tall cliff closed the\nview.\n\n‘There,’ said the Baronet, pointing to the tower, ‘you see the\nFelsenburg, your goal.  I wish you a good journey, and regret I cannot be\nof more assistance.’\n\nHe mounted to his place and gave a signal, and the carriage rolled away.\n\nSeraphina stood by the wayside, gazing before her with blind eyes.  Sir\nJohn she had dismissed already from her mind: she hated him, that was\nenough; for whatever Seraphina hated or contemned fell instantly to\nLilliputian smallness, and was thenceforward steadily ignored in thought.\nAnd now she had matter for concern indeed.  Her interview with Otto,\nwhich she had never yet forgiven him, began to appear before her in a\nvery different light.  He had come to her, still thrilling under recent\ninsult, and not yet breathed from fighting her own cause; and how that\nknowledge changed the value of his words!  Yes, he must have loved her!\nthis was a brave feeling—it was no mere weakness of the will.  And she,\nwas she incapable of love?  It would appear so; and she swallowed her\ntears, and yearned to see Otto, to explain all, to ask pity upon her\nknees for her transgressions, and, if all else were now beyond the reach\nof reparation, to restore at least the liberty of which she had deprived\nhim.\n\nSwiftly she sped along the highway, and, as the road wound out and in\nabout the bluffs and gullies of the mountain, saw and lost by glimpses\nthe tall tower that stood before and above her, purpled by the mountain\nair.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—TREATS OF A CHRISTIAN VIRTUE\n\n\nWhen Otto mounted to his rolling prison he found another occupant in a\ncorner of the front seat; but as this person hung his head and the\nbrightness of the carriage lamps shone outward, the Prince could only see\nit was a man.  The Colonel followed his prisoner and clapped-to the door;\nand at that the four horses broke immediately into a swinging trot.\n\n‘Gentlemen,’ said the Colonel, after some little while had passed, ‘if we\nare to travel in silence, we might as well be at home.  I appear, of\ncourse, in an invidious character; but I am a man of taste, fond of books\nand solidly informing talk, and unfortunately condemned for life to the\nguard-room.  Gentlemen, this is my chance: don’t spoil it for me.  I have\nhere the pick of the whole court, barring lovely woman; I have a great\nauthor in the person of the Doctor—’\n\n‘Gotthold!’ cried Otto.\n\n‘It appears,’ said the Doctor bitterly, ‘that we must go together.  Your\nHighness had not calculated upon that.’\n\n‘What do you infer?’ cried Otto; ‘that I had you arrested?’\n\n‘The inference is simple,’ said the Doctor.\n\n‘Colonel Gordon,’ said the Prince, ‘oblige me so far, and set me right\nwith Herr von Hohenstockwitz.’\n\n‘Gentlemen,’ said the Colonel, ‘you are both arrested on the same warrant\nin the name of the Princess Seraphina, acting regent, countersigned by\nPrime Minister Freiherr von Gondremark, and dated the day before\nyesterday, the twelfth.  I reveal to you the secrets of the\nprison-house,’ he added.\n\n‘Otto,’ said Gotthold, ‘I ask you to pardon my suspicions.’\n\n‘Gotthold,’ said the Prince, ‘I am not certain I can grant you that.’\n\n‘Your Highness is, I am sure, far too magnanimous to hesitate,’ said the\nColonel.  ‘But allow me: we speak at home in my religion of the means of\ngrace: and I now propose to offer them.’  So saying, the Colonel lighted\na bright lamp which he attached to one side of the carriage, and from\nbelow the front seat produced a goodly basket adorned with the long necks\nof bottles.  ‘_Tu spem reducis_—how does it go, Doctor?’ he asked gaily.\n‘I am, in a sense, your host; and I am sure you are both far too\nconsiderate of my embarrassing position to refuse to do me honour.\nGentlemen, I drink to the Prince!’\n\n‘Colonel,’ said Otto, ‘we have a jovial entertainer.  I drink to Colonel\nGordon.’\n\nThereupon all three took their wine very pleasantly; and even as they did\nso, the carriage with a lurch turned into the high-road and began to make\nbetter speed.\n\nAll was bright within; the wine had coloured Gotthold’s cheek; dim forms\nof forest trees, dwindling and spiring, scarves of the starry sky, now\nwide and now narrow, raced past the windows, through one that was left\nopen the air of the woods came in with a nocturnal raciness; and the roll\nof wheels and the tune of the trotting horses sounded merrily on the ear.\nToast followed toast; glass after glass was bowed across and emptied by\nthe trio; and presently there began to fall upon them a luxurious spell,\nunder the influence of which little but the sound of quiet and\nconfidential laughter interrupted the long intervals of meditative\nsilence.\n\n‘Otto,’ said Gotthold, after one of these seasons of quiet, ‘I do not ask\nyou to forgive me.  Were the parts reversed, I could not forgive you.’\n\n‘Well,’ said Otto, ‘it is a phrase we use.  I do forgive you, but your\nwords and your suspicions rankle; and not yours alone.  It is idle,\nColonel Gordon, in view of the order you are carrying out, to conceal\nfrom you the dissensions of my family; they have gone so far that they\nare now public property.  Well, gentlemen, can I forgive my wife?  I can,\nof course, and do; but in what sense?  I would certainly not stoop to any\nrevenge; as certainly I could not think of her but as one changed beyond\nmy recognition.’\n\n‘Allow me,’ returned the Colonel.  ‘You will permit me to hope that I am\naddressing Christians?  We are all conscious, I trust, that we are\nmiserable sinners.’\n\n‘I disown the consciousness,’ said Gotthold.  ‘Warmed with this good\nfluid, I deny your thesis.’\n\n‘How, sir?  You never did anything wrong? and I heard you asking pardon\nbut this moment, not of your God, sir, but of a common fellow-worm!’ the\nColonel cried.\n\n‘I own you have me; you are expert in argument, Herr Oberst,’ said the\nDoctor.\n\n‘Begad, sir, I am proud to hear you say so,’ said the Colonel.  ‘I was\nwell grounded indeed at Aberdeen.  And as for this matter of forgiveness,\nit comes, sir, of loose views and (what is if anything more dangerous) a\nregular life.  A sound creed and a bad morality, that’s the root of\nwisdom.  You two gentlemen are too good to be forgiving.’\n\n‘The paradox is somewhat forced,’ said Gotthold.\n\n‘Pardon me, Colonel,’ said the Prince; ‘I readily acquit you of any\ndesign of offence, but your words bite like satire.  Is this a time, do\nyou think, when I can wish to hear myself called good, now that I am\npaying the penalty (and am willing like yourself to think it just) of my\nprolonged misconduct?’\n\n‘O, pardon me!’ cried the Colonel.  ‘You have never been expelled from\nthe divinity hall; you have never been broke.  I was: broke for a neglect\nof military duty.  To tell you the open truth, your Highness, I was the\nworse of drink; it’s a thing I never do now,’ he added, taking out his\nglass.  ‘But a man, you see, who has really tasted the defects of his own\ncharacter, as I have, and has come to regard himself as a kind of blind\nteetotum knocking about life, begins to learn a very different view about\nforgiveness.  I will talk of not forgiving others, sir, when I have made\nout to forgive myself, and not before; and the date is like to be a long\none.  My father, the Reverend Alexander Gordon, was a good man, and\ndamned hard upon others.  I am what they call a bad one, and that is just\nthe difference.  The man who cannot forgive any mortal thing is a green\nhand in life.’\n\n‘And yet I have heard of you, Colonel, as a duellist,’ said Gotthold.\n\n‘A different thing, sir,’ replied the soldier.  ‘Professional etiquette.\nAnd I trust without unchristian feeling.’\n\nPresently after the Colonel fell into a deep sleep and his companions\nlooked upon each other, smiling.\n\n‘An odd fish,’ said Gotthold.\n\n‘And a strange guardian,’ said the Prince.  ‘Yet what he said was true.’\n\n‘Rightly looked upon,’ mused Gotthold, ‘it is ourselves that we cannot\nforgive, when we refuse forgiveness to our friend.  Some strand of our\nown misdoing is involved in every quarrel.’\n\n‘Are there not offences that disgrace the pardoner?’ asked Otto.  ‘Are\nthere not bounds of self-respect?’\n\n‘Otto,’ said Gotthold, ‘does any man respect himself?  To this poor waif\nof a soldier of fortune we may seem respectable gentlemen; but to\nourselves, what are we unless a pasteboard portico and a deliquium of\ndeadly weaknesses within?’\n\n‘I? yes,’ said Otto; ‘but you, Gotthold—you, with your interminable\nindustry, your keen mind, your books—serving mankind, scorning pleasures\nand temptations!  You do not know how I envy you.’\n\n‘Otto,’ said the Doctor, ‘in one word, and a bitter one to say: I am a\nsecret tippler.  Yes, I drink too much.  The habit has robbed these very\nbooks, to which you praise my devotion, of the merits that they should\nhave had.  It has spoiled my temper.  When I spoke to you the other day,\nhow much of my warmth was in the cause of virtue? how much was the fever\nof last night’s wine?  Ay, as my poor fellow-sot there said, and as I\nvaingloriously denied, we are all miserable sinners, put here for a\nmoment, knowing the good, choosing the evil, standing naked and ashamed\nin the eye of God.’\n\n‘Is it so?’ said Otto.  ‘Why, then, what are we?  Are the very best—’\n\n‘There is no best in man,’ said Gotthold.  ‘I am not better, it is likely\nI am not worse, than you or that poor sleeper.  I was a sham, and now you\nknow me: that is all.’\n\n‘And yet it has not changed my love,’ returned Otto softly.  ‘Our\nmisdeeds do not change us.  Gotthold, fill your glass.  Let us drink to\nwhat is good in this bad business; let us drink to our old affection;\nand, when we have done so, forgive your too just grounds of offence, and\ndrink with me to my wife, whom I have so misused, who has so misused me,\nand whom I have left, I fear, I greatly fear, in danger.  What matters it\nhow bad we are, if others can still love us, and we can still love\nothers?’\n\n‘Ay!’ replied the Doctor.  ‘It is very well said.  It is the true answer\nto the pessimist, and the standing miracle of mankind.  So you still love\nme? and so you can forgive your wife?  Why, then, we may bid conscience\n“Down, dog,” like an ill-trained puppy yapping at shadows.’\n\nThe pair fell into silence, the Doctor tapping on his empty glass.\n\nThe carriage swung forth out of the valleys on that open balcony of\nhigh-road that runs along the front of Grünewald, looking down on\nGerolstein.  Far below, a white waterfall was shining to the stars from\nthe falling skirts of forest, and beyond that, the night stood naked\nabove the plain.  On the other hand, the lamp-light skimmed the face of\nthe precipices, and the dwarf pine-trees twinkled with all their needles,\nand were gone again into the wake.  The granite roadway thundered under\nwheels and hoofs; and at times, by reason of its continual winding, Otto\ncould see the escort on the other side of a ravine, riding well together\nin the night.  Presently the Felsenburg came plainly in view, some way\nabove them, on a bold projection of the mountain, and planting its bulk\nagainst the starry sky.\n\n‘See, Gotthold,’ said the Prince, ‘our destination.’\n\nGotthold awoke as from a trance.\n\n‘I was thinking,’ said he, ‘if there is any danger, why did you not\nresist?  I was told you came of your free will; but should you not be\nthere to help her?’\n\nThe colour faded from the Prince’s cheeks.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—PROVIDENCE VON ROSEN: ACT THE LAST\nIN WHICH SHE GALLOPS OFF\n\n\nWhen the busy Countess came forth from her interview with Seraphina, it\nis not too much to say that she was beginning to be terribly afraid.  She\npaused in the corridor and reckoned up her doings with an eye to\nGondremark.  The fan was in requisition in an instant; but her disquiet\nwas beyond the reach of fanning.  ‘The girl has lost her head,’ she\nthought; and then dismally, ‘I have gone too far.’  She instantly decided\non secession.  Now the _Mons Sacer_ of the Frau von Rosen was a certain\nrustic villa in the forest, called by herself, in a smart attack of\npoesy, Tannen Zauber, and by everybody else plain Kleinbrunn.\n\nThither, upon the thought, she furiously drove, passing Gondremark at the\nentrance to the Palace avenue, but feigning not to observe him; and as\nKleinbrunn was seven good miles away, and in the bottom of a narrow dell,\nshe passed the night without any rumour of the outbreak reaching her; and\nthe glow of the conflagration was concealed by intervening hills.  Frau\nvon Rosen did not sleep well; she was seriously uneasy as to the results\nof her delightful evening, and saw herself condemned to quite a lengthy\nsojourn in her deserts and a long defensive correspondence, ere she could\nventure to return to Gondremark.  On the other hand, she examined, by way\nof pastime, the deeds she had received from Otto; and even here saw cause\nfor disappointment.  In these troublous days she had no taste for landed\nproperty, and she was convinced, besides, that Otto had paid dearer than\nthe farm was worth.  Lastly, the order for the Prince’s release fairly\nburned her meddling fingers.\n\nAll things considered, the next day beheld an elegant and beautiful lady,\nin a riding-habit and a flapping hat, draw bridle at the gate of the\nFelsenburg, not perhaps with any clear idea of her purpose, but with her\nusual experimental views on life.  Governor Gordon, summoned to the gate,\nwelcomed the omnipotent Countess with his most gallant bearing, though it\nwas wonderful how old he looked in the morning.\n\n‘Ah, Governor,’ she said, ‘we have surprises for you, sir,’ and nodded at\nhim meaningly.\n\n‘Eh, madam, leave me my prisoners,’ he said; ‘and if you will but join\nthe band, begad, I’ll be happy for life.’\n\n‘You would spoil me, would you not?’ she asked.\n\n‘I would try, I would try,’ returned the Governor, and he offered her his\narm.\n\nShe took it, picked up her skirt, and drew him close to her.  ‘I have\ncome to see the Prince,’ she said.  ‘Now, infidel! on business.  A\nmessage from that stupid Gondremark, who keeps me running like a courier.\nDo I look like one, Herr Gordon?’ And she planted her eyes in him.\n\n‘You look like an angel, ma’am,’ returned the Governor, with a great air\nof finished gallantry.\n\nThe Countess laughed.  ‘An angel on horseback!’ she said.  ‘Quick work.’\n\n‘You came, you saw, you conquered,’ flourished Gordon, in high good\nhumour with his own wit and grace.  ‘We toasted you, madam, in the\ncarriage, in an excellent good glass of wine; toasted you fathom deep;\nthe finest woman, with, begad, the finest eyes in Grünewald.  I never saw\nthe like of them but once, in my own country, when I was a young fool at\nCollege: Thomasina Haig her name was.  I give you my word of honour, she\nwas as like you as two peas.’\n\n‘And so you were merry in the carriage?’ asked the Countess, gracefully\ndissembling a yawn.\n\n‘We were; we had a very pleasant conversation; but we took perhaps a\nglass more than that fine fellow of a Prince has been accustomed to,’\nsaid the Governor; ‘and I observe this morning that he seems a little off\nhis mettle.  We’ll get him mellow again ere bedtime.  This is his door.’\n\n‘Well,’ she whispered, ‘let me get my breath.  No, no; wait.  Have the\ndoor ready to open.’  And the Countess, standing like one inspired, shook\nout her fine voice in ‘Lascia ch’io pianga’; and when she had reached the\nproper point, and lyrically uttered forth her sighings after liberty, the\ndoor, at a sign, was flung wide open, and she swam into the Prince’s\nsight, bright-eyed, and with her colour somewhat freshened by the\nexercise of singing.  It was a great dramatic entrance, and to the\nsomewhat doleful prisoner within the sight was sunshine.\n\n‘Ah, madam,’ he cried, running to her—‘you here!’\n\nShe looked meaningly at Gordon; and as soon as the door was closed she\nfell on Otto’s neck.  ‘To see you here!’ she moaned and clung to him.\n\nBut the Prince stood somewhat stiffly in that enviable situation, and the\nCountess instantly recovered from her outburst.\n\n‘Poor child,’ she said, ‘poor child!  Sit down beside me here, and tell\nme all about it.  My heart really bleeds to see you.  How does time go?’\n\n‘Madam,’ replied the Prince, sitting down beside her, his gallantry\nrecovered, ‘the time will now go all too quickly till you leave.  But I\nmust ask you for the news.  I have most bitterly condemned myself for my\ninertia of last night.  You wisely counselled me; it was my duty to\nresist.  You wisely and nobly counselled me; I have since thought of it\nwith wonder.  You have a noble heart.’\n\n‘Otto,’ she said, ‘spare me.  Was it even right, I wonder?  I have\nduties, too, you poor child; and when I see you they all melt—all my good\nresolutions fly away.’\n\n‘And mine still come too late,’ he replied, sighing.  ‘O, what would I\nnot give to have resisted?  What would I not give for freedom?’\n\n‘Well, what would you give?’ she asked; and the red fan was spread; only\nher eyes, as if from over battlements, brightly surveyed him.\n\n‘I?  What do you mean?  Madam, you have some news for me,’ he cried.\n\n‘O, O!’ said madam dubiously.\n\nHe was at her feet.  ‘Do not trifle with my hopes,’ he pleaded.  ‘Tell\nme, dearest Madame von Rosen, tell me!  You cannot be cruel: it is not in\nyour nature.  Give?  I can give nothing; I have nothing; I can only plead\nin mercy.’\n\n‘Do not,’ she said; ‘it is not fair.  Otto, you know my weakness.  Spare\nme.  Be generous.’\n\n‘O, madam,’ he said, ‘it is for you to be generous, to have pity.’  He\ntook her hand and pressed it; he plied her with caresses and appeals.\nThe Countess had a most enjoyable sham siege, and then relented.  She\nsprang to her feet, she tore her dress open, and, all warm from her\nbosom, threw the order on the floor.\n\n‘There!’ she cried.  ‘I forced it from her.  Use it, and I am ruined!’\nAnd she turned away as if to veil the force of her emotions.\n\nOtto sprang upon the paper, read it, and cried out aloud.  ‘O, God bless\nher!’ he said, ‘God bless her.’  And he kissed the writing.\n\nVon Rosen was a singularly good-natured woman, but her part was now\nbeyond her.  ‘Ingrate!’ she cried; ‘I wrung it from her, I betrayed my\ntrust to get it, and ’tis she you thank!’\n\n‘Can you blame me?’ said the Prince.  ‘I love her.’\n\n‘I see that,’ she said.  ‘And I?’\n\n‘You, Madame von Rosen?  You are my dearest, my kindest, and most\ngenerous of friends,’ he said, approaching her.  ‘You would be a perfect\nfriend, if you were not so lovely.  You have a great sense of humour, you\ncannot be unconscious of your charm, and you amuse yourself at times by\nplaying on my weakness; and at times I can take pleasure in the comedy.\nBut not to-day: to-day you will be the true, the serious, the manly\nfriend, and you will suffer me to forget that you are lovely and that I\nam weak.  Come, dear Countess, let me to-day repose in you entirely.’\n\nHe held out his hand, smiling, and she took it frankly.  ‘I vow you have\nbewitched me,’ she said; and then with a laugh, ‘I break my staff!’ she\nadded; ‘and I must pay you my best compliment.  You made a difficult\nspeech.  You are as adroit, dear Prince, as I am—charming.’  And as she\nsaid the word with a great curtsey, she justified it.\n\n‘You hardly keep the bargain, madam, when you make yourself so\nbeautiful,’ said the Prince, bowing.\n\n‘It was my last arrow,’ she returned.  ‘I am disarmed.  Blank cartridge,\n_O mon Prince_!  And now I tell you, if you choose to leave this prison,\nyou can, and I am ruined.  Choose!’\n\n‘Madame von Rosen,’ replied Otto, ‘I choose, and I will go.  My duty\npoints me, duty still neglected by this Featherhead.  But do not fear to\nbe a loser.  I propose instead that you should take me with you, a bear\nin chains, to Baron Gondremark.  I am become perfectly unscrupulous: to\nsave my wife I will do all, all he can ask or fancy.  He shall be filled;\nwere he huge as leviathan and greedy as the grave, I will content him.\nAnd you, the fairy of our pantomime, shall have the credit.’\n\n‘Done!’ she cried.  ‘Admirable!  Prince Charming no longer—Prince\nSorcerer, Prince Solon!  Let us go this moment.  Stay,’ she cried,\npausing.  ‘I beg dear Prince, to give you back these deeds.  ’Twas you\nwho liked the farm—I have not seen it; and it was you who wished to\nbenefit the peasants.  And, besides,’ she added, with a comical change of\ntone, ‘I should prefer the ready money.’\n\nBoth laughed.  ‘Here I am, once more a farmer,’ said Otto, accepting the\npapers, ‘but overwhelmed in debt.’\n\nThe Countess touched a bell, and the Governor appeared.\n\n‘Governor,’ she said, ‘I am going to elope with his Highness.  The result\nof our talk has been a thorough understanding, and the _coup d’état_ is\nover.  Here is the order.’\n\nColonel Gordon adjusted silver spectacles upon his nose.  ‘Yes,’ he said,\n‘the Princess: very right.  But the warrant, madam, was countersigned.’\n\n‘By Heinrich!’ said von Rosen.  ‘Well, and here am I to represent him.’\n\n‘Well, your Highness,’ resumed the soldier of fortune, ‘I must\ncongratulate you upon my loss.  You have been cut out by beauty, and I am\nleft lamenting.  The Doctor still remains to me: _probus_, _doctus_,\n_lepidus_, _jucundus_: a man of books.’\n\n‘Ay, there is nothing about poor Gotthold,’ said the Prince.\n\n‘The Governor’s consolation?  Would you leave him bare?’ asked von Rosen.\n\n‘And, your Highness,’ resumed Gordon, ‘may I trust that in the course of\nthis temporary obscuration, you have found me discharge my part with\nsuitable respect and, I may add, tact?  I adopted purposely a\ncheerfulness of manner; mirth, it appeared to me, and a good glass of\nwine, were the fit alleviations.’\n\n‘Colonel,’ said Otto, holding out his hand, ‘your society was of itself\nenough.  I do not merely thank you for your pleasant spirits; I have to\nthank you, besides, for some philosophy, of which I stood in need.  I\ntrust I do not see you for the last time; and in the meanwhile, as a\nmemento of our strange acquaintance, let me offer you these verses on\nwhich I was but now engaged.  I am so little of a poet, and was so ill\ninspired by prison bars, that they have some claim to be at least a\ncuriosity.’\n\nThe Colonel’s countenance lighted as he took the paper; the silver\nspectacles were hurriedly replaced.  ‘Ha!’ he said, ‘Alexandrines, the\ntragic metre.  I shall cherish this, your Highness, like a relic; no more\nsuitable offering, although I say it, could be made. “_Dieux de l’immense\nplaine et des vastes forêts_.”  Very good,’ he said, ‘very good indeed!\n“_Et du geôlier lui-même apprendre des leçons_.”  Most handsome, begad!’\n\n‘Come, Governor,’ cried the Countess, ‘you can read his poetry when we\nare gone.  Open your grudging portals.’\n\n‘I ask your pardon,’ said the Colonel.  ‘To a man of my character and\ntastes, these verses, this handsome reference—most moving, I assure you.\nCan I offer you an escort?’\n\n‘No, no,’ replied the Countess.  ‘We go incogniti, as we arrived.  We\nride together; the Prince will take my servant’s horse.  Hurry and\nprivacy, Herr Oberst, that is all we seek.’ And she began impatiently to\nlead the way.\n\nBut Otto had still to bid farewell to Dr. Gotthold; and the Governor\nfollowing, with his spectacles in one hand and the paper in the other,\nhad still to communicate his treasured verses, piece by piece, as he\nsucceeded in deciphering the manuscript, to all he came across; and still\nhis enthusiasm mounted.  ‘I declare,’ he cried at last, with the air of\none who has at length divined a mystery, ‘they remind me of Robbie\nBurns!’\n\nBut there is an end to all things; and at length Otto was walking by the\nside of Madame von Rosen, along that mountain wall, her servant following\nwith both the horses, and all about them sunlight, and breeze, and flying\nbird, and the vast regions of the air, and the capacious prospect:\nwildwood and climbing pinnacle, and the sound and voice of mountain\ntorrents, at their hand: and far below them, green melting into sapphire\non the plains.\n\nThey walked at first in silence; for Otto’s mind was full of the delight\nof liberty and nature, and still, betweenwhiles, he was preparing his\ninterview with Gondremark.  But when the first rough promontory of the\nrock was turned, and the Felsenburg concealed behind its bulk, the lady\npaused.\n\n‘Here,’ she said, ‘I will dismount poor Karl, and you and I must ply our\nspurs.  I love a wild ride with a good companion.’\n\nAs she spoke, a carriage came into sight round the corner next below them\nin the order of the road.  It came heavily creaking, and a little ahead\nof it a traveller was soberly walking, note-book in hand.\n\n‘It is Sir John,’ cried Otto, and he hailed him.\n\nThe Baronet pocketed his note-book, stared through an eye-glass, and then\nwaved his stick; and he on his side, and the Countess and the Prince on\ntheirs, advanced with somewhat quicker steps.  They met at the re-entrant\nangle, where a thin stream sprayed across a boulder and was scattered in\nrain among the brush; and the Baronet saluted the Prince with much\npunctilio.  To the Countess, on the other hand, he bowed with a kind of\nsneering wonder.\n\n‘Is it possible, madam, that you have not heard the news?’ he asked.\n\n‘What news?’ she cried.\n\n‘News of the first order,’ returned Sir John: ‘a revolution in the State,\na Republic declared, the palace burned to the ground, the Princess in\nflight, Gondremark wounded—’\n\n‘Heinrich wounded?’ she screamed.\n\n‘Wounded and suffering acutely,’ said Sir John.  ‘His groans—’\n\nThere fell from the lady’s lips an oath so potent that, in smoother\nhours, it would have made her hearers jump.  She ran to her horse,\nscrambled to the saddle, and, yet half seated, dashed down the road at\nfull gallop.  The groom, after a pause of wonder, followed her.  The rush\nof her impetuous passage almost scared the carriage horses over the verge\nof the steep hill; and still she clattered further, and the crags echoed\nto her flight, and still the groom flogged vainly in pursuit of her.  At\nthe fourth corner, a woman trailing slowly up leaped back with a cry and\nescaped death by a hand’s-breadth.  But the Countess wasted neither\nglance nor thought upon the incident.  Out and in, about the bluffs of\nthe mountain wall, she fled, loose-reined, and still the groom toiled in\nher pursuit.\n\n‘A most impulsive lady!’ said Sir John.  ‘Who would have thought she\ncared for him?’  And before the words were uttered, he was struggling in\nthe Prince’s grasp.\n\n‘My wife! the Princess?  What of her?’\n\n‘She is down the road,’ he gasped.  ‘I left her twenty minutes back.’\n\nAnd next moment, the choked author stood alone, and the Prince on foot\nwas racing down the hill behind the Countess.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—BABES IN THE WOOD\n\n\nWhile the feet of the Prince continued to run swiftly, his heart, which\nhad at first by far outstripped his running, soon began to linger and\nhang back.  Not that he ceased to pity the misfortune or to yearn for the\nsight of Seraphina; but the memory of her obdurate coldness awoke within\nhim, and woke in turn his own habitual diffidence of self.  Had Sir John\nbeen given time to tell him all, had he even known that she was speeding\nto the Felsenburg, he would have gone to her with ardour.  As it was, he\nbegan to see himself once more intruding, profiting, perhaps, by her\nmisfortune, and now that she was fallen, proffering unloved caresses to\nthe wife who had spurned him in prosperity.  The sore spots upon his\nvanity began to burn; once more, his anger assumed the carriage of a\nhostile generosity; he would utterly forgive indeed; he would help, save,\nand comfort his unloving wife; but all with distant self-denial, imposing\nsilence on his heart, respecting Seraphina’s disaffection as he would the\ninnocence of a child.  So, when at length he turned a corner and beheld\nthe Princess, it was his first thought to reassure her of the purity of\nhis respect, and he at once ceased running and stood still.  She, upon\nher part, began to run to him with a little cry; then, seeing him pause,\nshe paused also, smitten with remorse; and at length, with the most\nguilty timidity, walked nearly up to where he stood.\n\n‘Otto,’ she said, ‘I have ruined all!’\n\n‘Seraphina!’ he cried with a sob, but did not move, partly withheld by\nhis resolutions, partly struck stupid at the sight of her weariness and\ndisorder.  Had she stood silent, they had soon been locked in an embrace.\nBut she too had prepared herself against the interview, and must spoil\nthe golden hour with protestations.\n\n‘All!’ she went on, ‘I have ruined all!  But, Otto, in kindness you must\nhear me—not justify, but own, my faults.  I have been taught so cruelly;\nI have had such time for thought, and see the world so changed.  I have\nbeen blind, stone-blind; I have let all true good go by me, and lived on\nshadows.  But when this dream fell, and I had betrayed you, and thought I\nhad killed—’  She paused.  ‘I thought I had killed Gondremark,’ she said\nwith a deep flush, ‘and I found myself alone, as you said.’\n\nThe mention of the name of Gondremark pricked the Princes generosity like\na spur.  ‘Well,’ he cried, ‘and whose fault was it but mine?  It was my\nduty to be beside you, loved or not.  But I was a skulker in the grain,\nand found it easier to desert than to oppose you.  I could never learn\nthat better part of love, to fight love’s battles.  But yet the love was\nthere.  And now when this toy kingdom of ours has fallen, first of all by\nmy demerits, and next by your inexperience, and we are here alone\ntogether, as poor as Job and merely a man and a woman—let me conjure you\nto forgive the weakness and to repose in the love.  Do not mistake me!’\nhe cried, seeing her about to speak, and imposing silence with uplifted\nhand.  ‘My love is changed; it is purged of any conjugal pretension; it\ndoes not ask, does not hope, does not wish for a return in kind.  You may\nforget for ever that part in which you found me so distasteful, and\naccept without embarrassment the affection of a brother.’\n\n‘You are too generous, Otto,’ she said.  ‘I know that I have forfeited\nyour love.  I cannot take this sacrifice.  You had far better leave me.\nO, go away, and leave me to my fate!’\n\n‘O no!’ said Otto; ‘we must first of all escape out of this hornet’s\nnest, to which I led you.  My honour is engaged.  I said but now we were\nas poor as Job; and behold! not many miles from here I have a house of my\nown to which I will conduct you.  Otto the Prince being down, we must try\nwhat luck remains to Otto the Hunter.  Come, Seraphina; show that you\nforgive me, and let us set about this business of escape in the best\nspirits possible.  You used to say, my dear, that, except as a husband\nand a prince, I was a pleasant fellow.  I am neither now, and you may\nlike my company without remorse.  Come, then; it were idle to be\ncaptured.  Can you still walk?  Forth, then,’ said he, and he began to\nlead the way.\n\nA little below where they stood, a good-sized brook passed below the\nroad, which overleapt it in a single arch.  On one bank of that\nloquacious water a foot-path descended a green dell.  Here it was rocky\nand stony, and lay on the steep scarps of the ravine; here it was choked\nwith brambles; and there, in fairy haughs, it lay for a few paces evenly\non the green turf.  Like a sponge, the hillside oozed with well-water.\nThe burn kept growing both in force and volume; at every leap it fell\nwith heavier plunges and span more widely in the pool.  Great had been\nthe labours of that stream, and great and agreeable the changes it had\nwrought.  It had cut through dykes of stubborn rock, and now, like a\nblowing dolphin, spouted through the orifice; along all its humble\ncoasts, it had undermined and rafted-down the goodlier timber of the\nforest; and on these rough clearings it now set and tended primrose\ngardens, and planted woods of willow, and made a favourite of the silver\nbirch.  Through all these friendly features the path, its human acolyte,\nconducted our two wanderers downward,—Otto before, still pausing at the\nmore difficult passages to lend assistance; the Princess following.  From\ntime to time, when he turned to help her, her face would lighten upon\nhis—her eyes, half desperately, woo him.  He saw, but dared not\nunderstand.  ‘She does not love me,’ he told himself, with magnanimity.\n‘This is remorse or gratitude; I were no gentleman, no, nor yet a man, if\nI presumed upon these pitiful concessions.’\n\nSome way down the glen, the stream, already grown to a good bulk of\nwater, was rudely dammed across, and about a third of it abducted in a\nwooden trough.  Gaily the pure water, air’s first cousin, fleeted along\nthe rude aqueduct, whose sides and floor it had made green with grasses.\nThe path, bearing it close company, threaded a wilderness of briar and\nwild-rose.  And presently, a little in front, the brown top of a mill and\nthe tall mill-wheel, spraying diamonds, arose in the narrows of the glen;\nat the same time the snoring music of the saws broke the silence.\n\nThe miller, hearing steps, came forth to his door, and both he and Otto\nstarted.\n\n‘Good-morning, miller,’ said the Prince.  ‘You were right, it seems, and\nI was wrong.  I give you the news, and bid you to Mittwalden.  My throne\nhas fallen—great was the fall of it!—and your good friends of the Phoenix\nbear the rule.’\n\nThe red-faced miller looked supreme astonishment.  ‘And your Highness?’\nhe gasped.\n\n‘My Highness is running away,’ replied Otto, ‘straight for the frontier.’\n\n‘Leaving Grünewald?’ cried the man.  ‘Your father’s son?  It’s not to be\npermitted!’\n\n‘Do you arrest us, friend?’ asked Otto, smiling.\n\n‘Arrest you?  I?’ exclaimed the man.  ‘For what does your Highness take\nme?  Why, sir, I make sure there is not a man in Grünewald would lay\nhands upon you.’\n\n‘O, many, many,’ said the Prince; ‘but from you, who were bold with me in\nmy greatness, I should even look for aid in my distress.’\n\nThe miller became the colour of beetroot.  ‘You may say so indeed,’ said\nhe.  ‘And meanwhile, will you and your lady step into my house.’\n\n‘We have not time for that,’ replied the Prince; ‘but if you would oblige\nus with a cup of wine without here, you will give a pleasure and a\nservice, both in one.’\n\nThe miller once more coloured to the nape.  He hastened to bring forth\nwine in a pitcher and three bright crystal tumblers.  ‘Your Highness must\nnot suppose,’ he said, as he filled them, ‘that I am an habitual drinker.\nThe time when I had the misfortune to encounter you, I was a trifle\novertaken, I allow; but a more sober man than I am in my ordinary, I do\nnot know where you are to look for; and even this glass that I drink to\nyou (and to the lady) is quite an unusual recreation.’\n\nThe wine was drunk with due rustic courtesies; and then, refusing further\nhospitality, Otto and Seraphina once more proceeded to descend the glen,\nwhich now began to open and to be invaded by the taller trees.\n\n‘I owed that man a reparation,’ said the Prince; ‘for when we met I was\nin the wrong and put a sore affront upon him.  I judge by myself,\nperhaps; but I begin to think that no one is the better for a\nhumiliation.’\n\n‘But some have to be taught so,’ she replied.\n\n‘Well, well,’ he said, with a painful embarrassment.  ‘Well, well.  But\nlet us think of safety.  My miller is all very good, but I do not pin my\nfaith to him.  To follow down this stream will bring us, but after\ninnumerable windings, to my house.  Here, up this glade, there lies a\ncross-cut—the world’s end for solitude—the very deer scarce visit it.\nAre you too tired, or could you pass that way?’\n\n‘Choose the path, Otto.  I will follow you,’ she said.\n\n‘No,’ he replied, with a singular imbecility of manner and appearance,\n‘but I meant the path was rough.  It lies, all the way, by glade and\ndingle, and the dingles are both deep and thorny.’\n\n‘Lead on,’ she said.  ‘Are you not Otto the Hunter?’\n\nThey had now burst across a veil of underwood, and were come into a lawn\namong the forest, very green and innocent, and solemnly surrounded by\ntrees.  Otto paused on the margin, looking about him with delight; then\nhis glance returned to Seraphina, as she stood framed in that silvan\npleasantness and looking at her husband with undecipherable eyes.  A\nweakness both of the body and mind fell on him like the beginnings of\nsleep; the cords of his activity were relaxed, his eyes clung to her.\n‘Let us rest,’ he said; and he made her sit down, and himself sat down\nbeside her on the slope of an inconsiderable mound.\n\nShe sat with her eyes downcast, her slim hand dabbling in grass, like a\nmaid waiting for love’s summons.  The sound of the wind in the forest\nswelled and sank, and drew near them with a running rush, and died away\nand away in the distance into fainting whispers.  Nearer hand, a bird out\nof the deep covert uttered broken and anxious notes.  All this seemed but\na halting prelude to speech.  To Otto it seemed as if the whole frame of\nnature were waiting for his words; and yet his pride kept him silent.\nThe longer he watched that slender and pale hand plucking at the grasses,\nthe harder and rougher grew the fight between pride and its kindly\nadversary.\n\n‘Seraphina,’ he said at last, ‘it is right you should know one thing: I\nnever . . .’  He was about to say ‘doubted you,’ but was that true?  And,\nif true, was it generous to speak of it?  Silence succeeded.\n\n‘I pray you, tell it me,’ she said; ‘tell it me, in pity.’\n\n‘I mean only this,’ he resumed, ‘that I understand all, and do not blame\nyou.  I understand how the brave woman must look down on the weak man.  I\nthink you were wrong in some things; but I have tried to understand it,\nand I do.  I do not need to forget or to forgive, Seraphina, for I have\nunderstood.’\n\n‘I know what I have done,’ she said.  ‘I am not so weak that I can be\ndeceived with kind speeches.  I know what I have been—I see myself.  I am\nnot worth your anger, how much less to be forgiven!  In all this downfall\nand misery, I see only me and you: you, as you have been always; me, as I\nwas—me, above all!  O yes, I see myself: and what can I think?’\n\n‘Ah, then, let us reverse the parts!’ said Otto.  ‘It is ourselves we\ncannot forgive, when we deny forgiveness to another—so a friend told me\nlast night.  On these terms, Seraphina, you see how generously _I_ have\nforgiven myself.  But am not I to be forgiven?  Come, then, forgive\nyourself—and me.’\n\nShe did not answer in words, but reached out her hand to him quickly.  He\ntook it; and as the smooth fingers settled and nestled in his, love ran\nto and fro between them in tender and transforming currents.\n\n‘Seraphina,’ he cried, ‘O, forget the past!  Let me serve and help you;\nlet me be your servant; it is enough for me to serve you and to be near\nyou; let me be near you, dear—do not send me away.’  He hurried his\npleading like the speech of a frightened child.  ‘It is not love,’ he\nwent on; ‘I do not ask for love; my love is enough . . .’\n\n‘Otto!’ she said, as if in pain.\n\nHe looked up into her face.  It was wrung with the very ecstasy of\ntenderness and anguish; on her features, and most of all in her changed\neyes, there shone the very light of love.\n\n‘Seraphina?’ he cried aloud, and with a sudden, tuneless voice,\n‘Seraphina?’\n\n‘Look round you at this glade,’ she cried, ‘and where the leaves are\ncoming on young trees, and the flowers begin to blossom.  This is where\nwe meet, meet for the first time; it is so much better to forget and to\nbe born again.  O what a pit there is for sins—God’s mercy, man’s\noblivion!’\n\n‘Seraphina,’ he said, ‘let it be so, indeed; let all that was be merely\nthe abuse of dreaming; let me begin again, a stranger.  I have dreamed,\nin a long dream, that I adored a girl unkind and beautiful; in all things\nmy superior, but still cold, like ice.  And again I dreamed, and thought\nshe changed and melted, glowed and turned to me.  And I—who had no merit\nbut a love, slavish and unerect—lay close, and durst not move for fear of\nwaking.’\n\n‘Lie close,’ she said, with a deep thrill of speech.\n\nSo they spake in the spring woods; and meanwhile, in Mittwalden\nRath-haus, the Republic was declared.\n\n\n\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL POSTSCRIPT TO COMPLETE THE STORY\n\n\nThe reader well informed in modern history will not require details as to\nthe fate of the Republic.  The best account is to be found in the memoirs\nof Herr Greisengesang (7 Bände: Leipzig), by our passing acquaintance the\nlicentiate Roederer.  Herr Roederer, with too much of an author’s\nlicence, makes a great figure of his hero—poses him, indeed, to be the\ncentre-piece and cloud-compeller of the whole.  But, with due allowance\nfor this bias, the book is able and complete.\n\nThe reader is of course acquainted with the vigorous and bracing pages of\nSir John (2 vols., London: Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown).  Sir\nJohn, who plays but a tooth-comb in the orchestra of this historical\nromance, blows in his own book the big bassoon.  His character is there\ndrawn at large; and the sympathy of Landor has countersigned the\nadmiration of the public.  One point, however, calls for explanation; the\nchapter on Grünewald was torn by the hand of the author in the palace\ngardens; how comes it, then, to figure at full length among my more\nmodest pages, the Lion of the caravan?  That eminent literatus was a man\nof method; ‘Juvenal by double entry,’ he was once profanely called; and\nwhen he tore the sheets in question, it was rather, as he has since\nexplained, in the search for some dramatic evidence of his sincerity,\nthan with the thought of practical deletion.  At that time, indeed, he\nwas possessed of two blotted scrolls and a fair copy in double.  But the\nchapter, as the reader knows, was honestly omitted from the famous\n‘Memoirs on the various Courts of Europe.’  It has been mine to give it\nto the public.\n\nBibliography still helps us with a further glimpse of our characters.  I\nhave here before me a small volume (printed for private circulation: no\nprinter’s name; n.d.), ‘Poésies par Frédéric et Amélie.’  Mine is a\npresentation copy, obtained for me by Mr. Bain in the Haymarket; and the\nname of the first owner is written on the fly-leaf in the hand of Prince\nOtto himself.  The modest epigraph—‘Le rime n’est pas riche’—may be\nattributed, with a good show of likelihood, to the same collaborator.  It\nis strikingly appropriate, and I have found the volume very dreary.\nThose pieces in which I seem to trace the hand of the Princess are\nparticularly dull and conscientious.  But the booklet had a fair success\nwith that public for which it was designed; and I have come across some\nevidences of a second venture of the same sort, now unprocurable.  Here,\nat least, we may take leave of Otto and Seraphina—what do I say? of\nFrédéric and Amélie—ageing together peaceably at the court of the wife’s\nfather, jingling French rhymes and correcting joint proofs.\n\nStill following the book-lists, I perceive that Mr. Swinburne has\ndedicated a rousing lyric and some vigorous sonnets to the memory of\nGondremark; that name appears twice at least in Victor Hugo’s\ntrumpet-blasts of patriot enumeration; and I came latterly, when I\nsupposed my task already ended, on a trace of the fallen politician and\nhis Countess.  It is in the ‘Diary of J. Hogg Cotterill, Esq.’ (that very\ninteresting work).  Mr. Cotterill, being at Naples, is introduced (May\n27th) to ‘a Baron and Baroness Gondremark—he a man who once made a\nnoise—she still beautiful—both witty.  She complimented me much upon my\nFrench—should never have known me to be English—had known my uncle, Sir\nJohn, in Germany—recognised in me, as a family trait, some of his _grand\nair_ and studious courtesy—asked me to call.’  And again (May 30th),\n‘visited the Baronne de Gondremark—much gratified—a most _refined_,\n_intelligent_ woman, quite of the old school, now, _hélas_! extinct—had\nread my _Remarks on Sicily_—it reminds her of my uncle, but with more of\ngrace—I feared she thought there was less energy—assured no—a softer\nstyle of presentation, more of the _literary grace_, but the same firm\ngrasp of circumstance and force of thought—in short, just Buttonhole’s\nopinion.  Much encouraged.  I have a real esteem for this patrician\nlady.’  The acquaintance lasted some time; and when Mr. Cotterill left in\nthe suite of Lord Protocol, and, as he is careful to inform us, in\nAdmiral Yardarm’s flag-ship, one of his chief causes of regret is to\nleave ‘that most _spirituelle_ and sympathetic lady, who already regards\nme as a younger brother.’"
