Prof. G.C. Macauley.\n\n\n\n\nPrologus\n\n\n          Torpor, ebes sensus, scola parua labor minimusque\n               Causant quo minimus ipse minora canam:\n          Qua tamen Engisti lingua canit Insula Bruti\n               Anglica Carmente metra iuuante loquar.\n          Ossibus ergo carens que conterit ossa loquelis\n               Absit, et interpres stet procul oro malus.\n\n\n          Of hem that writen ous tofore\n          The bokes duelle, and we therfore\n          Ben tawht of that was write tho:\n          Forthi good is that we also\n          In oure tyme among ous hiere\n          Do wryte of newe som matiere,\n          Essampled of these olde wyse\n          So that it myhte in such a wyse,\n          Whan we ben dede and elleswhere,\n          Beleve to the worldes eere   10\n          In tyme comende after this.\n          Bot for men sein, and soth it is,\n          That who that al of wisdom writ\n          It dulleth ofte a mannes wit\n          To him that schal it aldai rede,\n          For thilke cause, if that ye rede,\n          I wolde go the middel weie\n          And wryte a bok betwen the tweie,\n          Somwhat of lust, somewhat of lore,\n          That of the lasse or of the more   20\n          Som man mai lyke of that I wryte:\n          And for that fewe men endite\n          In oure englissh, I thenke make\n          A bok for Engelondes sake,\n          The yer sextenthe of kyng Richard.\n          What schal befalle hierafterward\n          God wot, for now upon this tyde\n          Men se the world on every syde\n          In sondry wyse so diversed,\n          That it welnyh stant al reversed,   30\n          As forto speke of tyme ago.\n          The cause whi it changeth so\n          It needeth nought to specifie,\n          The thing so open is at ije\n          That every man it mai beholde:\n          And natheles be daies olde,\n          Whan that the bokes weren levere,\n          Wrytinge was beloved evere\n          Of hem that weren vertuous;\n          For hier in erthe amonges ous,   40\n          If noman write hou that it stode,\n          The pris of hem that weren goode\n          Scholde, as who seith, a gret partie\n          Be lost: so for to magnifie\n          The worthi princes that tho were,\n          The bokes schewen hiere and there,\n          Wherof the world ensampled is;\n          And tho that deden thanne amis\n          Thurgh tirannie and crualte,\n          Right as thei stoden in degre,   50\n          So was the wrytinge of here werk.\n          Thus I, which am a burel clerk,\n          Purpose forto wryte a bok\n          After the world that whilom tok\n          Long tyme in olde daies passed:\n          Bot for men sein it is now lassed,\n          In worse plit than it was tho,\n          I thenke forto touche also\n          The world which neweth every dai,\n          So as I can, so as I mai.   60\n          Thogh I seknesse have upon honde\n          And longe have had, yit woll I fonde\n          To wryte and do my bisinesse,\n          That in som part, so as I gesse,\n          The wyse man mai ben avised.\n          For this prologe is so assised\n          That it to wisdom al belongeth:\n          What wysman that it underfongeth,\n          He schal drawe into remembrance\n          The fortune of this worldes chance,   70\n          The which noman in his persone\n          Mai knowe, bot the god al one.\n          Whan the prologe is so despended,\n          This bok schal afterward ben ended\n          Of love, which doth many a wonder\n          And many a wys man hath put under.\n          And in this wyse I thenke trete\n          Towardes hem that now be grete,\n          Betwen the vertu and the vice\n          Which longeth unto this office.   80\n          Bot for my wittes ben to smale\n          To tellen every man his tale,\n          This bok, upon amendment\n          To stonde at his commandement,\n          With whom myn herte is of accord,\n          I sende unto myn oghne lord,\n          Which of Lancastre is Henri named:\n          The hyhe god him hath proclamed\n          Ful of knyhthode and alle grace.\n          So woll I now this werk embrace   90\n          With hol trust and with hol believe;\n          God grante I mot it wel achieve.\n          If I schal drawe in to my mynde\n          The tyme passed, thanne I fynde\n          The world stod thanne in al his welthe:\n          Tho was the lif of man in helthe,\n          Tho was plente, tho was richesse,\n          Tho was the fortune of prouesse,\n          Tho was knyhthode in pris be name,\n          Wherof the wyde worldes fame   100\n          Write in Cronique is yit withholde;\n          Justice of lawe tho was holde,\n          The privilege of regalie\n          Was sauf, and al the baronie\n          Worschiped was in his astat;\n          The citees knewen no debat,\n          The poeple stod in obeissance\n          Under the reule of governance,\n          And pes, which ryhtwisnesse keste,\n          With charite tho stod in reste:   110\n          Of mannes herte the corage\n          Was schewed thanne in the visage;\n          The word was lich to the conceite\n          Withoute semblant of deceite:\n          Tho was ther unenvied love,\n          Tho was the vertu sett above\n          And vice was put under fote.\n          Now stant the crop under the rote,\n          The world is changed overal,\n          And therof most in special   120\n          That love is falle into discord.\n          And that I take to record\n          Of every lond for his partie\n          The comun vois, which mai noght lie;\n          Noght upon on, bot upon alle\n          It is that men now clepe and calle,\n          And sein the regnes ben divided,\n          In stede of love is hate guided,\n          The werre wol no pes purchace,\n          And lawe hath take hire double face,   130\n          So that justice out of the weie\n          With ryhtwisnesse is gon aweie:\n          And thus to loke on every halve,\n          Men sen the sor withoute salve,\n          Which al the world hath overtake.\n          Ther is no regne of alle outtake,\n          For every climat hath his diel\n          After the tornynge of the whiel,\n          Which blinde fortune overthroweth;\n          Wherof the certain noman knoweth:   140\n          The hevene wot what is to done,\n          Bot we that duelle under the mone\n          Stonde in this world upon a weer,\n          And namely bot the pouer\n          Of hem that ben the worldes guides\n          With good consail on alle sides\n          Be kept upriht in such a wyse,\n          That hate breke noght thassise\n          Of love, which is al the chief\n          To kepe a regne out of meschief.   150\n          For alle resoun wolde this,\n          That unto him which the heved is\n          The membres buxom scholden bowe,\n          And he scholde ek her trowthe allowe,\n          With al his herte and make hem chiere,\n          For good consail is good to hiere.\n          Althogh a man be wys himselve,\n          Yit is the wisdom more of tuelve;\n          And if thei stoden bothe in on,\n          To hope it were thanne anon   160\n          That god his grace wolde sende\n          To make of thilke werre an ende,\n          Which every day now groweth newe:\n          And that is gretly forto rewe\n          In special for Cristes sake,\n          Which wolde his oghne lif forsake\n          Among the men to yeve pes.\n          But now men tellen natheles\n          That love is fro the world departed,\n          So stant the pes unevene parted   170\n          With hem that liven now adaies.\n          Bot forto loke at alle assaies,\n          To him that wolde resoun seche\n          After the comun worldes speche\n          It is to wondre of thilke werre,\n          In which non wot who hath the werre;\n          For every lond himself deceyveth\n          And of desese his part receyveth,\n          And yet ne take men no kepe.\n          Bot thilke lord which al may kepe,   180\n          To whom no consail may ben hid,\n          Upon the world which is betid,\n          Amende that wherof men pleigne\n          With trewe hertes and with pleine,\n          And reconcile love ayeyn,\n          As he which is king sovereign\n          Of al the worldes governaunce,\n          And of his hyhe porveaunce\n          Afferme pes betwen the londes\n          And take her cause into hise hondes,   190\n          So that the world may stonde apppesed\n          And his godhede also be plesed.\n          To thenke upon the daies olde,\n          The lif of clerkes to beholde,\n          Men sein how that thei weren tho\n          Ensample and reule of alle tho\n          Whiche of wisdom the vertu soughten.\n          Unto the god ferst thei besoughten\n          As to the substaunce of her Scole,\n          That thei ne scholden noght befole   200\n          Her wit upon none erthly werkes,\n          Which were ayein thestat of clerkes,\n          And that thei myhten fle the vice\n          Which Simon hath in his office,\n          Wherof he takth the gold in honde.\n          For thilke tyme I understonde\n          The Lumbard made non eschange\n          The bisschopriches forto change,\n          Ne yet a lettre for to sende\n          For dignite ne for Provende,   210\n          Or cured or withoute cure.\n          The cherche keye in aventure\n          Of armes and of brygantaille\n          Stod nothing thanne upon bataille;\n          To fyhte or for to make cheste\n          It thoghte hem thanne noght honeste;\n          Bot of simplesce and pacience\n          Thei maden thanne no defence:\n          The Court of worldly regalie\n          To hem was thanne no baillie;   220\n          The vein honour was noght desired,\n          Which hath the proude herte fyred;\n          Humilite was tho withholde,\n          And Pride was a vice holde.\n          Of holy cherche the largesse\n          Yaf thanne and dede gret almesse\n          To povere men that hadden nede:\n          Thei were ek chaste in word and dede,\n          Wherof the poeple ensample tok;\n          Her lust was al upon the bok,   230\n          Or forto preche or forto preie,\n          To wisse men the ryhte weie\n          Of suche as stode of trowthe unliered.\n          Lo, thus was Petres barge stiered\n          Of hem that thilke tyme were,\n          And thus cam ferst to mannes Ere\n          The feith of Crist and alle goode\n          Thurgh hem that thanne weren goode\n          And sobre and chaste and large and wyse.\n          Bot now men sein is otherwise,   240\n          Simon the cause hath undertake,\n          The worldes swerd on honde is take;\n          And that is wonder natheles,\n          Whan Crist him self hath bode pes\n          And set it in his testament,\n          How now that holy cherche is went,\n          Of that here lawe positif\n          Hath set to make werre and strif\n          For worldes good, which may noght laste.\n          God wot the cause to the laste   250\n          Of every right and wrong also;\n          But whil the lawe is reuled so\n          That clerkes to the werre entende,\n          I not how that thei scholde amende\n          The woful world in othre thinges,\n          To make pes betwen the kynges\n          After the lawe of

And veine gloire is ek so slyh,\n          Which coveitise hath now withholde,\n          That thei non other thing beholde,\n          Bot only that thei myhten winne.\n          And thus the werres

And evere stant a man in doute,\n          Fortune stant no while stille,\n          So hath ther noman al his wille.\n          Als fer as evere a man may knowe,\n          Ther lasteth nothing bot a

Touchende of this, bot overmo\n          Ther is an other yit of Pride,\n          Which nevere cowthe hise wordes hide,\n          That he ne wole himself avaunte;\n          Ther mai nothing his

 He torneth into vilenie.\n          I rede how that this proude vice\n          Hath thilke wynd in his office,  2410\n          Which thurgh the blastes that he bloweth\n          The mannes fame he

 Now schrif thee, Sone, in godes pes,\n          And of thi love tell me plein\n          If that thi gloire hath be so vein.   2720\n          Mi fader, as touchinge of al\n          I may noght wel

And whan Nessus the privete   2190\n          Knew of here herte what it mente,\n          As he that was of double entente,\n          He made hem riht a glad visage;\n          And whanne he herde

Wel payd was Hercules of this,\n          And this Geant also glad is,\n          And tok this ladi up alofte\n          And set hire on his schuldre softe,    2220\n          And in the flod began to

         Pleinly to helen such a Sor;\n          It hath and schal ben everemor,     2790\n          Whan Pride is with Envie joint,\n          He soffreth noman in good point,\n          Wher that he

      For in Cronique of time ago\n          I finde a tale concordable\n          Of Supplant, which that is no fable,   2800\n          In the manere as I schal telle,\n          So as whilom the thinges felle.\n          At Rome, as it hath ofte falle,\n          The vicair general of alle\n          Of hem that lieven Cristes feith\n          His laste day, which non withseith,\n          Hath schet as to the worldes ije,\n          Whos name if I schal specefie,\n          He hihte Pope Nicolas.\n          And thus whan that he passed was,   2810\n          The Cardinals, that wolden save\n          The forme of lawe, in the conclave\n          Gon forto chese a newe Pope,\n          And after that thei cowthe agrope\n          Hath ech of hem seid his entente:\n          Til ate

     Thus was he Pope canonized,\n          With gret honour and intronized,\n          And upon chance as it is falle,\n          His name Celestin men calle;\n          Which notefied was be bulle\n          To holi cherche and to the fulle\n          In alle londes magnified.\n          Bot every worschipe is envied,\n          And that was thilke time sene:\n          For whan this Pope of whom I meene     2830\n          Was chose, and othre set beside,\n          A Cardinal was thilke tide\n          Which the papat longe hath desired\n          And therupon gretli conspired;\n          Bot whan he sih fortune is failed,\n          For which long time he hath travailed,\n          That ilke fyr which Ethna brenneth\n          Thurghout his wofull herte renneth,\n          Which is

     Bot al withinne his conscience\n          Thurgh fals ymaginacioun\n          He thoghte Supplantacioun.\n          And therupon a wonder wyle\n          He wroghte: for at thilke whyle\n          It fell so that of his lignage\n          He hadde a clergoun of yong age,    2850\n          Whom he hath in his chambre affaited.\n          This Cardinal his time hath waited,\n          And with

      Upon a day whan he hath while\n          This yonge clerc unto him tok,\n          And made him swere upon a bok,\n          And told him what his wille was.\n          And forth withal a Trompe

   As ye, my fader, now have herd.\n          Min herte is wonderly begon\n          With conseil, wherof witt is on,\n          Which hath resoun in compaignie;\n          Ayein the whiche stant

 Of fetheres and of othre thinges\n          Hath mad to fle diverse wynges  1050\n          For him and for his Sone also;\n          To whom he yaf in charge tho\n          And bad him thenke

And thus thei have her flyht begonne\n          Out of the prison faire and softe;\n          And whan thei weren bothe alofte,  1060\n          This Icharus began to monte,\n          And of the

In aunter if I mai hire lede\n          Unto the chapelle and ayein.\n          Thanne is noght al mi weie in vein,\n          Somdiel I mai the betre fare,\n          Whan I, that mai noght fiele hir

Now with hir briddes in the cage;\n          For ther is non so litel page,\n          Ne yit so simple a chamberere,\n          That I ne make hem alle chere,\n          Al for thei scholde speke

Wherof that Puile and ek Cartage\n          With Philosophres wise and grete\n          Begunne of this matiere trete,\n          And ate laste in this degre\n          Ther weren Philosophres thre,\n

Which hadde be soubgit tofore,\n          Whan this Mirour was so forlore\n          And thei the wonder herde seie,\n          Anon begunne desobeie\n          With werres upon every side;\n          And thus hath Rome lost his pride\n          And was defouled overal.\n          For this I finde of Hanybal,\n          That he of Romeins in a dai,\n          Whan he hem fond out of arai,   2200\n          So gret a multitude slowh,\n          That of goldringes, whiche he drowh\n          Of gentil handes that ben dede,\n          Buisshelles fulle thre, I rede,\n          He felde, and made a

 And sette here Emperour therinne,\n          And seiden, for he wolde winne\n          Of gold the superfluite,\n          Of gold he scholde such plente\n          Receive, til he seide Ho:\n          And with gold, which thei hadden tho  2220\n          Buillende hot withinne a panne,\n          Into his Mouth thei poure thanne.\n          And thus the thurst of gold was queynt,\n          With

Wher thei the profit mihten cacche:\n          And yit fulofte it falleth so,\n          As men mai sen among hem tho,\n          That he which most coveiteth faste\n          Hath lest avantage ate

That, hou so that it were awaited,\n          With sobre and goodli contenance\n          He scholde his wommanhiede avance,\n          That non the sothe knowe myhte,\n          Bot that in every

     Wherof the tale in special\n          Is in the bok of Troie write,\n          Which I schal do thee forto wite.\n          In Grece whilom was a king,\n          Of whom the fame and

     To regnen after his decess.\n          He hadde a brother natheles,\n          Whos rihte name was Eson,\n          And he the worthi kniht Jason\n          Begat, the which in every lond\n          Alle othre passede of his hond\n          In Armes, so that he the beste\n          Was named and the worthieste,   3260\n          He soghte worschipe overal.\n          Nou herkne, and I thee

many a worthi kniht\n          It hadde assaied, as thei dorste,\n          And evere it fell hem to the worste.\n          Bot he, that wolde it noght forsake,\n          Bot of his knyhthod

othre Marches, where he wente;\n          And for that cause his hole entente\n          He sette Colchos forto seche,\n          And therupon he made a speche\n          To Pele\u0001s his Em the king.\n          And he wel paid was of that thing;    3290\n          And schop anon for his passage,\n          And suche as were of his lignage,\n          With othre knihtes whiche he ches,\n          With him he tok, and Hercules,\n          Which full was of chivalerie,\n          With Jason wente in compaignie;\n          And that was in the Monthe of Maii,\n          Whan colde stormes were away.\n          The wynd was good, the Schip was yare,\n          Thei tok here leve, and forth thei fare  3300\n          Toward Colchos: bot on the weie\n          What hem befell is long to

And so fell the dissencion,\n          Which after was destruccion\n          Of that Cite, as men mai hiere:\n          Bot that is noght to mi matiere.   3310\n          Bot thus this worthi folk

thei were,\n          He thoghte don hem gret worschipe:\n          For thei anon come out of Schipe,\n          And strawht unto the king thei wente,\n          And be the hond Jason he hente,\n          And that was ate paleis gate,\n          So fer the king cam on his gate    3330\n          Toward Jason to don him chiere;\n          And he, whom lacketh no manere,\n          Whan he the king sih in presence,\n          Yaf him ayein such reverence\n          As to a kinges stat belongeth.\n          And thus the king him underfongeth,\n          And Jason in his arm he cawhte,\n          And forth into the halle he strawhte,\n          And ther they siete and spieke of thinges,\n          And Jason tolde him tho tidinges,  3340\n          Why he was come, and faire him preide\n          To haste his time, and the kyng seide,\n          \"Jason, thou art a worthi kniht,\n          Bot it lith in no mannes myht\n          To don that thou art come fore:\n          Ther hath be many a

    Per aunter wel, per aunter wo:\n          Bot hou as evere that it go,\n          It schal be with myn hond assaied.\"\n          The king tho hield him noght wel paied,\n          For he the Grekes sore dredde,\n          In aunter, if Jason ne spedde,\n          He mihte therof bere a blame;\n          For tho was al the worldes fame\n          In Grece, as forto speke of Armes.\n          Forthi he dredde him of his harmes,       3360\n          And gan to preche him and to preie;\n          Bot Jason wolde noght obeie,\n          Bot seide he wolde his porpos holde\n          For ought that eny man him tolde.\n          The king, whan he thes wordes herde,\n          And sih hou that this kniht ansuerde,\n          Yit for he wolde make him glad,\n          After Medea gon he bad,\n          Which was his dowhter, and sche cam.\n          And Jason, which good hiede nam,   3370\n          Whan he hire sih, ayein hire goth;\n          And sche, which was him nothing loth,\n          Welcomede him into that lond,\n          And softe tok him be the hond,\n          And doun thei seten bothe same.\n          Sche hadde herd spoke of his name\n          And of his grete worthinesse;\n          Forthi sche gan hir yhe impresse\n          Upon his face and his stature,\n          And thoghte hou nevere creature    3380\n          Was so wel farende as was he.\n          And Jason riht in such degre\n          Ne mihte noght withholde his lok,\n          Bot so good hiede on hire he tok,\n          That him ne thoghte under the hevene\n          Of beaute sawh he nevere hir evene,\n          With al that fell to wommanhiede.\n          Thus ech of other token hiede,\n          Thogh ther no word was of record;\n          Here hertes bothe of on acord   3390\n          Ben set to love, bot as tho\n          Ther mihten be no wordes mo.\n          The king made him gret joie and feste,\n          To alle his men he yaf an heste,\n          So as thei wolde his thonk deserve,\n          That thei scholde alle Jason serve,\n          Whil that he wolde there duelle.\n          And thus the dai, schortly to telle,\n          With manye merthes thei despente,\n          Til nyht was come, and tho thei wente,   3400\n          Echon of other tok his leve,\n          Whan thei no lengere myhten leve.\n          I not hou Jason that nyht slep,\n          Bot wel I wot that of the Schep,\n          For which he cam into that yle,\n          He thoghte bot a litel whyle;\n          Al was Medea that he thoghte,\n          So that in many a wise he soghte\n          His witt wakende er it was day,\n          Som time yee, som time nay,  3410\n          Som time thus, som time so,\n          As he was stered to and fro\n          Of love, and ek of his conqueste\n          As he was holde of his beheste.\n          And thus he ros up be the morwe\n          And tok himself seint John to borwe,\n          And seide he wolde ferst beginne\n          At love, and after forto winne\n          The flees of gold, for which he com,\n          And thus to him good herte he nom.    3420\n          Medea riht the same wise,\n          Til dai cam that sche moste arise,\n          Lay and bethoughte hire al the nyht,\n          Hou sche that noble worthi kniht\n          Be eny weie mihte wedde:\n          And wel sche wiste, if he ne spedde\n          Of thing which he hadde undertake,\n          Sche mihte hirself no porpos take;\n          For if he deide of his bataile,\n          Sche moste thanne algate faile  3430\n          To geten

      To speke and telle of hir desir.\n          And so it fell that same day\n          That Jason with that suete may\n          Togedre sete and hadden space\n          To speke, and he besoughte hir grace.    3440\n          And sche his tale goodli herde,\n          And afterward sche him ansuerde\n          And seide, \"Jason, as thou wilt,\n          Thou miht be sauf, thou miht be

 He thonketh hire of that tidinge,\n          For of that grace him is begonne\n          Him thenkth alle othre thinges wonne.\n          The dai made ende and lost his lyht,\n          And comen was the derke nyht,\n          Which al the daies yhe blente.\n          Jason tok leve and forth he wente,\n          And whan he cam out of the pres,\n          He tok to conseil Hercules,  3470\n          And tolde him hou it was betid,\n          And preide it scholde wel ben hid,\n          And that he wolde loke aboute,\n          Therwhiles that he schal ben oute.\n          Thus as he stod and hiede nam,\n          A Mayden fro Medea cam\n          And to hir chambre Jason ledde,\n          Wher that he fond redi to bedde\n          The faireste and the wiseste eke;\n          And sche with

Which was begete in a riote\n          Upon Pasiphe, his oghne wif,\n          Whil he was oute upon the strif    5280\n          Of thilke grete Siege at Troie.\n          Bot sche, which lost hath

        In such a contre which was dreie\n          A meschief fell upon the weie.\n          As he rod with his compainie\n          Nyh to the strondes of Lubie,   410\n          Ther myhte thei no

     Among the vertus on is chief,\n          And that is trouthe, which is lief\n          To god and ek to man also.\n          And for it hath ben evere so,\n          Tawhte Aristotle, as he wel couthe,\n          To Alisandre, hou in his youthe\n          He scholde of trouthe thilke grace\n          With al his hole herte embrace,    1730\n          So that his word be trewe and plein,\n          Toward the world and so certein\n          That in him be no double speche:\n          For if men scholde trouthe seche\n          And founde it noght withinne a king,\n          It were an unsittende thing.\n          The word is tokne of that withinne,\n          Ther schal a worthi king beginne\n          To kepe his tunge and to be trewe,\n          So schal his pris ben evere newe.  1740\n          Avise him every man tofore,\n          And be wel war, er he be swore,\n          For afterward it is to late,\n          If that he wole his word debate.\n          For as a king in special\n          Above alle othre is principal\n          Of his pouer, so scholde he be\n          Most vertuous in his degre;\n          And that mai wel be signefied\n          Be his corone and

Commended ben in treble wise:\n          Ferst thei ben harde, and thilke assisse\n          Betokneth in a king Constance,\n          So that ther schal no variance\n          Be founde in his

   The Cronique of this worldes fame,\n          Which stant upon his goode name.   1770\n          The cercle which is round aboute\n          Is tokne of al the lond withoute,\n          Which stant

         A tale, which is evident\n          Of trouthe in comendacioun,\n          Toward thin enformacion,  1780\n          Mi Sone, hierafter thou schalt hiere\n          Of a Cronique in this

         And Manachaz was the secounde,\n          Zorobabel, as it is founde\n          In the Cronique, was the thridde.\n          This Soldan, what so him betidde,\n          To hem he triste most

Touchende a point hem hath opposed.   1810\n          The kinges question was this;\n          Of thinges thre which strengest is,\n          The wyn, the womman or the king:\n          And that thei

He schal receive a worthi mede.\n          Upon this thing thei token hiede   1820\n          And stoden in desputeison,\n          That be diverse opinion\n          Of Argumentz that thei have

thus a kinges myht, seith he,\n          So as his reson can argue,\n          Is strengest and of most value.\n          Bot Manachaz seide otherwise,\n          That wyn is of the more emprise;   1850\n          And that he scheweth be this weie.\n          The wyn fulofte takth aweie\n          The reson fro the mannes herte;\n          The wyn can make a krepel sterte,\n          And a

       That wommen ben the myhtieste.\n          The king and the vinour also\n          Of wommen comen bothe tuo;\n          And ek he seide hou that manhede\n          Thurgh strengthe unto the

Toward the grete of his empire,\n          Cirus the king tirant sche tok,\n          And only with hire goodly lok   1890\n          Sche made him debonaire and meke,\n          And be the chyn and

  Men waiten whan he scholde deie,\n          Alceste his wif goth forto preie,  1920\n          As sche which wolde thonk deserve,\n          With Sacrifice unto Minerve,\n          To wite ansuere

     And therupon withinne a throwe\n          This goode wif was overthrowe\n          And deide, and he was hool in haste.\n          So mai a man be reson taste,\n          Hou next after the god

Zorobabel hath told    1950\n          The tale of his opinion:\n          Bot for final conclusion\n          What strengest is of erthli thinges,\n          The wyn, the wommen or the kinges,\n          He seith that trouthe above hem alle\n          Is myhtiest, hou evere it falle.\n          The trouthe, hou so it evere come,\n          Mai for nothing ben overcome;\n          It mai wel soffre

That is to sein, if that he be\n          Toward himselven large and fre  2020\n          And of his poeple take and pile,\n          Largesse be no weie of skile\n          It mai be seid, bot

In sondri places do justice,\n          He schal of his real office\n          With wys consideracion\n          Ordeigne his deputacion   2750\n          Of suche jugges as ben lerned,\n          So that his poeple be governed\n          Be hem that trewe ben and wise.\n          For if the lawe of covoitise\n          Be set upon a jugges hond,\n          Wo is the poeple of thilke lond,\n          For wrong mai noght himselven hyde:\n          Bot elles on that other side,\n          If lawe stonde with the riht,\n          The poeple is glad and stant upriht.  2760\n          Wher as the

 Bot forto speke in special,\n          Ther have be suche and yit ther be\n          Tirantz, whos hertes no pite\n          Mai to no point of mercy plie,\n          That thei upon her tirannie\n

Duk, which Spertachus\n          Men clepe, and was a werreiour,\n          A cruel man, a conquerour    3420\n          With strong pouer the which he ladde.\n          For this condicion he hadde,\n          That where him hapneth the victoire,\n          His lust and al his moste gloire\n          Was forto sle and noght to save:\n          Of rancoun wolde he no good have\n          For savinge

    He fell riht heir as be descente\n          To Perse, and was coroned king.\n          And whan the worschipe of this thing\n          Was falle, and he was king of Perse,\n          If that thei weren ferst diverse,\n          The tirannies whiche he wroghte,\n          A thousendfold welmore he soghte\n          Thanne afterward to do malice.\n          The god vengance ayein the vice

      As it be olde daies fell,\n          I rede whilom that an hell\n          Up in the londes of Archade\n          A wonder dredful noise made;\n          For so it fell that ilke day,\n

      The nerr this hell was upon chance\n          To taken his deliverance,\n          The more unbuxomliche he cride;\n          And every man was fledd aside,  3570\n          For drede and lefte

  Thus if a king his herte ladde\n          With every thing that he schal hiere,\n          Fulofte he scholde change his chiere\n          And upon fantasie drede,\n          Whan that ther is no

The foles: for ther is nothing\n          Which mai be betre aboute a king,\n          Than conseil, which is the substance\n          Of all a kinges governance.  3890\n          In Salomon a man mai

3900\n          \"O king, be whom that I schal regne,\n          Yif me wisdom, that I my regne,\n          Forth with thi poeple which I have,\n          To thin honour mai kepe and save.\"\n          Whan Salomon his bone hath taxed,\n          The god of that which he hath axed\n          Was riht wel paid, and granteth sone\n          Noght al only that he his bone\n          Schal have of

And ferst the wise knyhtes olde,\n          To whom that he his tale tolde,\n          Conseilen him in this manere;\n          That he with love and with glad chiere   4070\n          Foryive and

That yong conseil, which is to warm,\n          Er men be war doth ofte harm.\n          Old age for the conseil serveth,\n          And lusti youthe his thonk deserveth\n          Upon the travail which he doth;\n          And bothe, forto seie a soth,   4140\n          Be sondri cause forto have,\n          If that he wole his regne save,\n          A king behoveth every day.\n          That on can and that other mai,\n          Be so the king hem bothe reule,\n          For elles al goth out of reule.\n          And upon this matiere also\n          A question betwen the tuo\n          Thus writen in a bok I fond;\n          Wher it be betre for the lond   4150\n          A king himselve to be wys,\n          And so to bere his oghne pris,\n          And that his consail be noght good,\n          Or other wise if it so stod,\n          A king if he be vicious\n          And his conseil be vertuous.\n          It is ansuerd in such a wise,\n          That betre it is that thei be wise\n          Be whom that the conseil schal gon,\n          For thei be manye, and he is on;   4160\n          And rathere schal an one man\n          With fals conseil, for oght he can,\n          From his wisdom be mad to falle,\n          Thanne he al one scholde hem alle\n          Fro vices into vertu change,\n          For that is wel the more strange.\n          Forthi the lond mai wel be glad,\n          Whos king with good conseil is lad,\n          Which set him unto rihtwisnesse,\n          So that his hihe worthinesse    4170\n          Betwen the reddour and Pite\n          Doth mercy forth with equite.\n          A king is holden overal\n          To Pite, bot in special\n          To hem wher he is most beholde;\n          Thei scholde his Pite most beholde\n          That ben the Lieges of his lond,\n          For thei ben evere under his hond\n          After the goddes ordinaunce\n          To stonde upon his governance.  4180\n          Of themperour Anthonius\n          I finde hou that he seide thus,\n          That levere him were forto save\n          Oon of his lieges than to have\n          Of enemis a thousend dede.\n          And this he lernede, as I rede,\n          Of Cipio, which hadde be\n          Consul of Rome. And thus to se\n          Diverse ensamples hou thei stonde,\n          A king which hath the charge on honde    4190\n          The comun poeple to governe,\n          If that he wole, he mai wel lerne.\n          Is non so good to the plesance\n          Of god, as is good governance;\n          And every governance is due\n          To Pite: thus I mai argue\n          That Pite is the foundement\n          Of every kinges regiment,\n          If it be medled with justice.\n          Thei tuo remuen alle vice,   4200\n          And ben of vertu most vailable\n          To make a kinges regne stable.\n          Lo, thus the foure pointz tofore,\n          In governance as thei ben bore,\n          Of trouthe ferst and of largesse,\n          Of Pite forth with rihtwisnesse,\n          I have hem told; and over this\n          The fifte point, so as it is\n          Set of the reule of Policie,\n          Wherof a king schal modefie  4210\n          The fleisschly lustes of nature,\n          Nou thenk I telle of such mesure,\n          That bothe kinde schal be served\n          And ek the lawe of god observed.\n          The Madle is mad for the the femele,\n          Bot where as on desireth fele,\n          That nedeth noght be weie of kinde:\n          For whan a man mai redy finde\n          His oghne wif, what scholde he seche\n          In strange places to beseche    4220\n          To borwe an other mannes plouh,\n          Whan he hath geere good ynouh\n          Affaited at his oghne heste,\n          And is to him wel more honeste\n          Than other thing which is unknowe?\n          Forthi scholde every good man knowe\n          And thenke, hou that in mariage\n          His trouthe pliht lith in morgage,\n          Which if he breke, it is falshode,\n          And that descordeth to manhode,    4230\n          And namely toward the grete,\n          Wherof the bokes alle trete;\n          So as the Philosophre techeth\n          To Alisandre, and him betecheth\n          The lore hou that he schal mesure\n          His bodi, so that no mesure\n          Of fleisshly lust he scholde excede.\n          And thus forth if I schal procede,\n          The fifte point, as I seide er,\n          Is chastete, which sielde wher  4240\n          Comth nou adaies into place;\n          And natheles, bot it be grace\n          Above alle othre in special,\n          Is non that chaste mai ben all.\n          Bot yit a kinges hihe astat,\n          Which of his ordre as a prelat\n          Schal ben enoignt and seintefied,\n          He mot be more magnefied\n          For dignete of his corone,\n          Than scholde an other low persone,    4250\n          Which is noght of so hih emprise.\n          Therfore a Prince him scholde avise,\n          Er that he felle in such riote,\n          And namely that he nassote\n          To change for the wommanhede\n          The worthinesse of his manhede.\n          Of Aristotle I have wel rad,\n          Hou he to Alisandre bad,\n          That forto gladen his corage\n          He schal beholde the visage  4260\n          Of wommen, whan that thei ben faire.\n          Bot yit he set an essamplaire,\n          His bodi so to guide and reule,\n          That he ne passe noght the reule,\n          Wherof that he himself beguile.\n          For in the womman is no guile\n          Of that a man himself bewhapeth;\n          Whan he his oghne wit bejapeth,\n          I can the wommen wel excuse:\n          Bot what man wole upon hem muse    4270\n          After the fool impression\n          Of his ymaginacioun,\n          Withinne himself the fyr he bloweth,\n          Wherof the womman nothing knoweth,\n          So mai sche nothing be to wyte.\n          For if a man himself excite\n          To drenche, and wol it noght forbere,\n          The water schal no blame bere.\n          What mai the gold, thogh men coveite?\n          If that a man wol love streite,    4280\n          The womman hath him nothing bounde;\n          If he his oghne herte wounde,\n          Sche mai noght lette the folie;\n          And thogh so felle of compainie\n          That he myht eny thing pourchace,\n          Yit makth a man the ferste chace,\n          The womman fleth and he poursuieth:\n          So that be weie of skile it suieth,\n          The man is cause, hou so befalle,\n          That he fulofte sithe is falle  4290\n          Wher that he mai noght wel aryse.\n          And natheles ful manye wise\n          Befoled have hemself er this,\n          As nou adaies yit it is\n          Among the men and evere was,\n          The stronge is fieblest in this cas.\n          It sit a man be weie of kinde\n          To love, bot it is noght kinde\n          A man for love his wit to lese:\n          For if the Monthe of Juil schal frese    4300\n          And that Decembre schal ben hot,\n          The yeer mistorneth, wel I wot.\n          To sen a man fro his astat\n          Thurgh his sotie effeminat,\n          And leve that a man schal do,\n          It is as Hose above the Scho,\n          To man which oghte noght ben used.\n          Bot yit the world hath ofte accused\n          Ful grete Princes of this dede,\n          Hou thei for love hemself mislede,    4310\n          Wherof manhode stod behinde,\n          Of olde ensamples as I finde.\n          These olde gestes tellen thus,\n          That whilom Sardana Pallus,\n          Which hield al hol in his empire\n          The grete kingdom of Assire,\n          Was thurgh the slouthe of his corage\n          Falle into thilke fyri rage\n          Of love, which the men assoteth,\n          Wherof himself he so rioteth,   4320\n          And wax so ferforth wommannyssh,\n          That ayein kinde, as if a fissh\n          Abide wolde upon the lond,\n          In wommen such a lust he fond,\n          That he duelte evere in chambre stille,\n          And only wroghte after the wille\n          Of wommen, so as he was bede,\n          That selden whanne in other stede\n          If that he wolde wenden oute,\n          To sen hou that it stod aboute.    4330\n          Bot ther he keste and there he pleide,\n          Thei tawhten him a Las to breide,\n          And weve a Pours, and to enfile\n          A Perle: and fell that ilke while,\n          On Barbarus the Prince of Mede\n          Sih hou this king in wommanhede\n          Was falle fro chivalerie,\n          And gat him help and compaignie,\n          And wroghte so, that ate laste\n          This king out of his regne he caste,  4340\n          Which was undon for everemo:\n          And yit men speken of him so,\n          That it is schame forto hiere.\n          Forthi to love is in manere.\n          King David hadde many a love,\n          Bot natheles alwey above\n          Knyhthode he kepte in such a wise,\n          That for no

poursuieth,\n          Whan it is time to ben armed,\n          His contre stant fulofte harmed,\n          Whan thenemis ben woxe bolde,\n          That thei defence non beholde.\n          Ful many

nothing worth,\n          For that set every vice forth\n          And every vertu put abak,\n          Wherof priss torneth into lak,\n          As in Cronique I mai reherse:\n          Which telleth hou the king of Perse,\n          That Cirus hihte, a werre hadde\n          Ayein a poeple which he dradde,\n          Of a contre which Liddos hihte;\n          Bot yit for oght that he do mihte  4370\n          As in bataille upon the werre,\n          He hadde of hem alwey the werre.\n          And whan he sih and wiste it wel,\n          That he be strengthe wan no del,\n          Thanne ate laste he caste a wyle\n          This worthi poeple to beguile,\n          And tok with hem a feigned pes,\n          Which scholde lasten endeles,\n          So as he seide in wordes wise,\n          Bot he thoghte al in other wise.   4380\n          For it betidd upon the cas,\n          Whan that this poeple in reste was,\n          Thei token eses manyfold;\n          And worldes ese, as it is told,\n          Be weie of kinde is the norrice\n          Of every lust which toucheth vice.\n          Thus whan thei were in lustes falle,\n          The werres ben foryeten alle;\n          Was non which wolde the worschipe\n          Of Armes, bot in idelschipe  4390\n          Thei putten besinesse aweie\n          And token hem to daunce and pleie;\n          Bot most above alle othre

         And thenke hou ther be joies none\n          Upon this Erthe mad to laste,\n          And hou the fleissh schal ate laste\n          The lustes of this lif forsake,\n          Him oghte a gret ensample take\n          Of Salomon, whos appetit\n          Was holy set upon delit,\n          To take of wommen the plesance:\n          So that upon his ignorance   4480\n          The wyde world merveileth yit,\n          That he, which alle mennes wit\n          In thilke time hath overpassed,\n          With fleisshly lustes was so tassed,\n          That he which ladde under the

the false goddes dede.  4490\n          This was the wise ecclesiaste,\n          The fame of whom schal evere laste,\n          That he the myhti god forsok,\n          Ayein the lawe whanne he tok\n

ladde,\n          That he knelende his armes spradde    4500\n          To Astrathen with gret humblesse,\n          Which of hire lond was the goddesse:\n          And sche that was a Moabite\n          So ferforth made him to delite\n          Thurgh lust, which al his wit devoureth,\n          That he Chamos hire god honoureth.\n          An other Amonyte also\n          With love him hath

With blinde lustes whiche he soghte;\n          Bot he it afterward aboghte.\n          For Achias Selonites,\n          Which was prophete, er his decess,\n          Whil he was in hise lustes alle,\n          Betokneth what schal after falle.\n          For on a day, whan that he mette\n          Jeroboam the knyht, he grette   4520\n          And bad him that he scholde abyde,\n          To hiere what him schal betyde.\n          And forth withal Achias caste\n          His mantell of, and also faste\n          He kut it into pieces twelve,\n          Wherof tuo partz toward himselve\n          He kepte, and al the remenant,\n          As god hath set his covenant,\n          He tok unto Jeroboas,\n          Of Nabal which the Sone was,    4530\n          And of the kinges court a knyht:\n          And seide him, \"Such is goddes myht,\n          As thou hast sen departed hiere\n          Mi mantell, riht in such manere\n          After the deth of Salomon\n

And thus therfore\n          The Philosophre upon this thing\n          Writ and conseileth to a king,  4560\n          That he the surfet of luxure\n          Schal tempre and reule of such mesure,\n          Which be to kinde sufficant\n          And ek to reson acordant,\n          So that the lustes ignorance\n          Be cause of no misgovernance,\n          Thurgh which that he be

For if it falle him otherwise,\n          He mai tho lustes sore drede.\n          For of Anthonie thus I rede,\n          Which of Severus was the Sone,\n          That he his lif of comun wone\n

And so forth with hise hurtes grene\n          In al the haste that he may\n          He rod, and cam that other day  4620\n          Unto Gabie the Cite,\n          And in he wente: and whan that

For evere and out of Rome exiled.\n          And thus he made hem to believe,\n          And seide, if that he myhte achieve\n          His pourpos, it schal wel be yolde,\n          Be so that thei

     Of every lust thende is a peine,\n          And every peine is good to fle;\n          So it is wonder thing to se,\n          Why such a thing schal be desired.\n          The more that a Stock

knowe\n          Wher that he goth, til he be falle:\n          Forthi, bot if it so befalle\n          With good conseil that he be lad,\n          Him oghte forto ben adrad.\n          For conseil passeth alle thing\n          To him which thenkth to ben a king;   2110\n          And every man for his partie\n          A kingdom hath to justefie,\n          That is to sein his oghne dom.\n          If he misreule that kingdom,\n          He lest himself, and that is more\n          Than if he loste Schip and Ore\n          And al the worldes good withal:\n          For what man that in special\n          Hath noght himself, he hath noght elles,\n          Nomor the perles than the schelles;   2120\n          Al is to him of o value:\n          Thogh he hadde at his retenue\n          The wyde world ryht as he wolde,\n          Whan he his herte hath noght withholde\n          Toward himself, al is in vein.\n          And thus, my Sone, I wolde sein,\n          As I seide er, that

noght of will. And to be lerned,\n          Ensamples thou hast many on\n          Of now and ek of time gon,\n          That every lust is bot a while;\n          And who that wole himself beguile,    2140\n          He may the rathere be deceived.\n          Mi Sone, now thou hast conceived\n          Somwhat of that I wolde mene;\n          Hierafterward it schal be sene\n          If that thou lieve upon mi

     Bot if he knewe himself the fare,\n          And felt it as it is in soth,\n          He scholde don riht as he doth,\n          Or elles werse in his degre:\n          For wel I wot, and so do

         Bot for final conclusion\n          I thenke a Supplicacion\n          With pleine wordes and expresse\n          Wryte unto Venus the goddesse,\n          The which I preie you to bere\n
