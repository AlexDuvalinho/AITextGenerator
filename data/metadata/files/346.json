North, east, south, stretched the level Nebraska plain of long\nrust-red grass that undulated constantly in the wind. To the west the\nground was broken and rough, and a narrow strip of timber wound along\nthe turbid, muddy little stream that had scarcely ambition enough to\ncrawl over its black bottom. If it had not been for the few stunted\ncottonwoods and elms that grew along its banks, Canute would have shot\nhimself years ago. The Norwegians are a timber-loving people, and if\nthere is even a turtle pond with a few plum bushes around it they seem\nirresistibly drawn toward it.\n\nAs to the shanty itself, Canute had built it without aid of any kind,\nfor when he first squatted along the banks of Rattlesnake Creek there\nwas not a human being within twenty miles. It was built of logs split\nin halves, the chinks stopped with mud and plaster. The roof was covered\nwith earth and was supported by one gigantic beam curved in the shape of\na round arch. It was almost impossible that any tree had ever grown in\nthat shape. The Norwegians used to say that Canute had taken the log\nacross his knee and bent it into the shape he wished. There were\ntwo rooms, or rather there was one room with a partition made of ash\nsaplings interwoven and bound together like big straw basket work. In\none corner there was a cook stove, rusted and broken. In the other a\nbed made of unplaned planks and poles. It was fully eight feet long, and\nupon it was a heap of dark bed clothing. There was a chair and a bench\nof colossal proportions. There was an ordinary kitchen cupboard with\na few cracked dirty dishes in it, and beside it on a tall box a tin\nwashbasin. Under the bed was a pile of pint flasks, some broken,\nsome whole, all empty. On the wood box lay a pair of shoes of almost\nincredible dimensions. On the wall hung a saddle, a gun, and some ragged\nclothing, conspicuous among which was a suit of dark cloth, apparently\nnew, with a paper collar carefully wrapped in a red silk handkerchief\nand pinned to the sleeve. Over the door hung a wolf and a badger skin,\nand on the door itself a brace of thirty or forty snake skins whose\nnoisy tails rattled ominously every time it opened. The strangest things\nin the shanty were the wide windowsills. At first glance they looked as\nthough they had been ruthlessly hacked and mutilated with a hatchet, but\non closer inspection all the notches and holes in the wood took form and\nshape. There seemed to be a series of pictures. They were, in a rough\nway, artistic, but the figures were heavy and labored, as though they\nhad been cut very slowly and with very awkward instruments. There were\nmen plowing with little horned imps sitting on their shoulders and on\ntheir horses' heads. There were men praying with a skull hanging over\ntheir heads and little demons behind them mocking their attitudes. There\nwere men fighting with big serpents, and skeletons dancing together. All\nabout these pictures were blooming vines and foliage such as never grew\nin this world, and coiled among the branches of the vines there was\nalways the scaly body of a serpent, and behind every flower there was\na serpent's head. It was a veritable Dance of Death by one who had felt\nits sting. In the wood box lay some boards, and every inch of them\nwas cut up in the same manner. Sometimes the work was very rude and\ncareless, and looked as though the hand of the workman had trembled. It\nwould sometimes have been hard to distinguish the men from their evil\ngeniuses but for one fact, the men were always grave and were either\ntoiling or praying, while the devils were always smiling and dancing.\nSeveral of these boards had been split for kindling and it was evident\nthat the artist did not value his work highly.\n\nIt was the first day of winter on the Divide. Canute stumbled into his\nshanty carrying a basket of cobs, and after filling the stove, sat\ndown on a stool and crouched his seven foot frame over the fire, staring\ndrearily out of the window at the wide gray sky. He knew by heart every\nindividual clump of bunch grass in the miles of red shaggy prairie that\nstretched before his cabin. He knew it in all the deceitful loveliness\nof its early summer, in all the bitter barrenness of its autumn. He had\nseen it smitten by all the plagues of Egypt. He had seen it parched by\ndrought, and sogged by rain, beaten by hail, and swept by fire, and in\nthe grasshopper years he had seen it eaten as bare and clean as bones\nthat the vultures have left. After the great fires he had seen it\nstretch for miles and miles, black and smoking as the floor of hell.\n\nHe rose slowly and crossed the room, dragging his big feet heavily as\nthough they were burdens to him. He looked out of the window into the\nhog corral and saw the pigs burying themselves in the straw before the\nshed. The leaden gray clouds were beginning to spill themselves, and the\nsnow flakes were settling down over the white leprous patches of frozen\nearth where the hogs had gnawed even the sod away. He shuddered and\nbegan to walk, trampling heavily with his ungainly feet. He was the\nwreck of ten winters on the Divide and he knew what that meant. Men fear\nthe winters of the Divide as a child fears night or as men in the North\nSeas fear the still dark cold of the polar twilight. His eyes fell upon\nhis gun, and he took it down from the wall and looked it over. He\nsat down on the edge of his bed and held the barrel towards his face,\nletting his forehead rest upon it, and laid his finger on the trigger.\nHe was perfectly calm, there was neither passion nor despair in his\nface, but the thoughtful look of a man who is considering. Presently\nhe laid down the gun, and reaching into the cupboard, drew out a pint\nbottle of raw white alcohol. Lifting it to his lips, he drank greedily.\nHe washed his face in the tin basin and combed his rough hair and\nshaggy blond beard. Then he stood in uncertainty before the suit of dark\nclothes that hung on the wall. For the fiftieth time he took them in\nhis hands and tried to summon courage to put them on. He took the paper\ncollar that was pinned to the sleeve of the coat and cautiously slipped\nit under his rough beard, looking with timid expectancy into the\ncracked, splashed glass that hung over the bench. With a short laugh he\nthrew it down on the bed, and pulling on his old black hat, he went out,\nstriking off across the level.\n\nIt was a physical necessity for him to get away from his cabin once in a\nwhile. He had been there for ten years, digging and plowing and sowing,\nand reaping what little the hail and the hot winds and the frosts left\nhim to reap. Insanity and suicide are very common things on the Divide.\nThey come on like an epidemic in the hot wind season. Those scorching\ndusty winds that blow up over the bluffs from Kansas seem to dry up the\nblood in men's veins as they do the sap in the corn leaves. Whenever the\nyellow scorch creeps down over the tender inside leaves about the ear,\nthen the coroners prepare for active duty; for the oil of the country is\nburned out and it does not take long for the flame to eat up the wick.\nIt causes no great sensation there when a Dane is found swinging to his\nown windmill tower, and most of the Poles after they have become too\ncareless and discouraged to shave themselves keep their razors to cut\ntheir throats with.\n\nIt may be that the next generation on the Divide will be very happy, but\nthe present one came too late in life. It is useless for men that have\ncut hemlocks among the mountains of Sweden for forty years to try to be\nhappy in a country as flat and gray and naked as the sea. It is not easy\nfor men that have spent their youth fishing in the Northern seas to be\ncontent with following a plow, and men that have served in the Austrian\narmy hate hard work and coarse clothing on the loneliness of the plains,\nand long for marches and excitement and tavern company and pretty\nbarmaids. After a man has passed his fortieth birthday it is not easy\nfor him to change the habits and conditions of his life. Most men bring\nwith them to the Divide only the dregs of the lives that they have\nsquandered in other lands and among other peoples.\n\nCanute Canuteson was as mad as any of them, but his madness did not\ntake the form of suicide or religion but of alcohol. He had always taken\nliquor when he wanted it, as all Norwegians do, but after his first year\nof solitary life he settled down to it steadily. He exhausted whisky\nafter a while, and went to alcohol, because its effects were speedier\nand surer. He was a big man and with a terrible amount of resistant\nforce, and it took a great deal of alcohol even to move him. After nine\nyears of drinking, the quantities he could take would seem fabulous to\nan ordinary drinking man. He never let it interfere with his work, he\ngenerally drank at night and on Sundays. Every night, as soon as his\nchores were done, he began to drink. While he was able to sit up he\nwould play on his mouth harp or hack away at his window sills with his\njackknife. When the liquor went to his head he would lie down on his bed\nand stare out of the window until he went to sleep. He drank alone and\nin solitude not for pleasure or good cheer, but to forget the awful\nloneliness and level of the Divide. Milton made a sad blunder when he\nput mountains in hell. Mountains postulate faith and aspiration. All\nmountain peoples are religious. It was the cities of the plains that,\nbecause of their utter lack of spirituality and the mad caprice of their\nvice, were cursed of God.\n\nAlcohol is perfectly consistent in its effects upon man. Drunkenness is\nmerely an exaggeration. A foolish man drunk becomes maudlin; a bloody\nman, vicious; a coarse man, vulgar. Canute was none of these, but he was\nmorose and gloomy, and liquor took him through all the hells of Dante.\nAs he lay on his giant's bed all the horrors of this world and every\nother were laid bare to his chilled senses. He was a man who knew no\njoy, a man who toiled in silence and bitterness. The skull and the\nserpent were always before him, the symbols of eternal futileness and of\neternal hate.\n\nWhen the first Norwegians near enough to be called neighbors came,\nCanute rejoiced, and planned to escape from his bosom vice. But he was\nnot a social man by nature and had not the power of drawing out the\nsocial side of other people. His new neighbors rather feared him because\nof his great strength and size, his silence and his lowering brows.\nPerhaps, too, they knew that he was mad, mad from the eternal treachery\nof the plains, which every spring stretch green and rustle with the\npromises of Eden, showing long grassy lagoons full of clear water\nand cattle whose hoofs are stained with wild roses. Before autumn the\nlagoons are dried up, and the ground is burnt dry and hard until it\nblisters and cracks open.\n\nSo instead of becoming a friend and neighbor to the men that settled\nabout him, Canute became a mystery and a terror. They told awful stories\nof his size and strength and of the alcohol he drank.\n\nThey said that one night, when he went out to see to his horses just\nbefore he went to bed, his steps were unsteady and the rotten planks\nof the floor gave way and threw him behind the feet of a fiery young\nstallion. His foot was caught fast in the floor, and the nervous horse\nbegan kicking frantically. When Canute felt the blood trickling down\ninto his eyes from a scalp wound in his head, he roused himself from his\nkingly indifference, and with the quiet stoical courage of a drunken man\nleaned forward and wound his arms about the horse's hind legs and held\nthem against his breast with crushing embrace. All through the darkness\nand cold of the night he lay there, matching strength against strength.\nWhen little Jim Peterson went over the next morning at four o'clock to\ngo with him to the Blue to cut wood, he found him so, and the horse was\non its fore knees, trembling and whinnying with fear. This is the story\nthe Norwegians tell of him, and if it is true it is no wonder that they\nfeared and hated this Holder of the Heels of Horses.\n\nOne spring there moved to the next “eighty” a family that made a great\nchange in Canute's life. Ole Yensen was too drunk most of the time to be\nafraid of any one, and his wife Mary was too garrulous to be afraid of\nany one who listened to her talk, and Lena, their pretty daughter, was\nnot afraid of man nor devil. So it came about that Canute went over to\ntake his alcohol with Ole oftener than he took it alone, After a while\nthe report spread that he was going to marry Yensen's daughter, and the\nNorwegian girls began to tease Lena about the great bear she was going\nto keep house for. No one could quite see how the affair had come about,\nfor Canute's tactics of courtship were somewhat peculiar. He apparently\nnever spoke to her at all: he would sit for hours with Mary chattering\non one side of him and Ole drinking on the other and watch Lena at her\nwork. She teased him, and threw flour in his face and put vinegar in\nhis coffee, but he took her rough jokes with silent wonder, never even\nsmiling. He took her to church occasionally, but the most watchful and\ncurious people never saw him speak to her. He would sit staring at her\nwhile she giggled and flirted with the other men.\n\nNext spring Mary Lee went to town to work in a steam laundry. She came\nhome every Sunday, and always ran across to Yensens to startle Lena\nwith stories of ten cent theaters, firemen's dances, and all the other\nesthetic delights of metropolitan life. In a few weeks Lena's head was\ncompletely turned, and she gave her father no rest until he let her go\nto town to seek her fortune at the ironing board. From the time she came\nhome on her first visit she began to treat Canute with contempt. She had\nbought a plush cloak and kid gloves, had her clothes made by the dress\nmaker, and assumed airs and graces that made the other women of the\nneighborhood cordially detest her. She generally brought with her a\nyoung man from town who waxed his mustache and wore a red necktie, and\nshe did not even introduce him to Canute.\n\nThe neighbors teased Canute a good deal until he knocked one of them\ndown. He gave no sign of suffering from her neglect except that he drank\nmore and avoided the other Norwegians more carefully than ever, He lay\naround in his den and no one knew what he felt or thought, but little\nJim Peterson, who had seen him glowering at Lena in church one Sunday\nwhen she was there with the town man, said that he would not give an\nacre of his wheat for Lena's life or the town chap's either; and Jim's\nwheat was so wondrously worthless that the statement was an exceedingly\nstrong one.\n\nCanute had bought a new suit of clothes that looked as nearly like the\ntown man as possible. They had cost him half a millet crop; for\ntailors are not accustomed to fitting giants and they charge for it. He\nhad hung those clothes in his shanty two months ago and had never put\nthem on, partly from fear of ridicule, partly from discouragement, and\npartly because there was something in his own soul that revolted at the\nlittleness of the device.\n\nLena was at home just at this time. Work was slack in the laundry and\nMary had not been well, so Lena stayed at home, glad enough to get an\nopportunity to torment Canute once more.\n\nShe was washing in the side kitchen, singing loudly as she worked. Mary\nwas on her knees, blacking the stove and scolding violently about the\nyoung man who was coming out from town that night. The young man had\ncommitted the fatal error of laughing at Mary's ceaseless babble and had\nnever been forgiven.\n\n“He is no good, and you will come to a bad end by running with him! I do\nnot see why a daughter of mine should act so. I do not see why the Lord\nshould visit such a punishment upon me as to give me such a daughter.\nThere are plenty of good men you can marry.”\n\nLena tossed her head and answered curtly, “I don't happen to want to\nmarry any man right away, and so long as Dick dresses nice and has\nplenty of money to spend, there is no harm in my going with him.”\n\n“Money to spend? Yes, and that is all he does with it I'll be bound. You\nthink it very fine now, but you will change your tune when you have been\nmarried five years and see your children running naked and your cupboard\nempty. Did Anne Hermanson come to any good end by marrying a town man?”\n\n“I don't know anything about Anne Hermanson, but I know any of the\nlaundry girls would have Dick quick enough if they could get him.”\n\n“Yes, and a nice lot of store clothes huzzies you are too. Now there is\nCanuteson who has an 'eighty' proved up and fifty head of cattle and--”\n\n“And hair that ain't been cut since he was a baby, and a big dirty\nbeard, and he wears overalls on Sundays, and drinks like a pig. Besides\nhe will keep. I can have all the fun I want, and when I am old and ugly\nlike you he can have me and take care of me. The Lord knows there ain't\nnobody else going to marry him.”\n\nCanute drew his hand back from the latch as though it were red hot. He\nwas not the kind of man to make a good eavesdropper, and he wished he\nhad knocked sooner. He pulled himself together and struck the door like\na battering ram. Mary jumped and opened it with a screech.\n\n“God! Canute, how you scared us! I thought it was crazy Lou--he has been\ntearing around the neighborhood trying to convert folks. I am afraid as\ndeath of him. He ought to be sent off, I think. He is just as liable as\nnot to kill us all, or burn the barn, or poison the dogs. He has been\nworrying even the poor minister to death, and he laid up with the\nrheumatism, too! Did you notice that he was too sick to preach last\nSunday? But don't stand there in the cold, come in. Yensen isn't here,\nbut he just went over to Sorenson's for the mail; he won't be gone long.\nWalk right in the other room and sit down.”\n\nCanute followed her, looking steadily in front of him and not noticing\nLena as he passed her. But Lena's vanity would not allow him to pass\nunmolested. She took the wet sheet she was wringing out and cracked him\nacross the face with it, and ran giggling to the other side of the room.\nThe blow stung his cheeks and the soapy water flew in his eyes, and\nhe involuntarily began rubbing them with his hands. Lena giggled with\ndelight at his discomfiture, and the wrath in Canute's face grew blacker\nthan ever. A big man humiliated is vastly more undignified than a little\none. He forgot the sting of his face in the bitter consciousness that\nhe had made a fool of himself He stumbled blindly into the living room,\nknocking his head against the door jamb because he forgot to stoop.\nHe dropped into a chair behind the stove, thrusting his big feet back\nhelplessly on either side of him.\n\nOle was a long time in coming, and Canute sat there, still and silent,\nwith his hands clenched on his knees, and the skin of his face seemed to\nhave shriveled up into little wrinkles that trembled when he lowered his\nbrows. His life had been one long lethargy of solitude and alcohol,\nbut now he was awakening, and it was as when the dumb stagnant heat of\nsummer breaks out into thunder.\n\nWhen Ole came staggering in, heavy with liquor, Canute rose at once.\n\n“Yensen,” he said quietly, “I have come to see if you will let me marry\nyour daughter today.”\n\n“Today!” gasped Ole.\n\n“Yes, I will not wait until tomorrow. I am tired of living alone.”\n\nOle braced his staggering knees against the bedstead, and stammered\neloquently: “Do you think I will marry my daughter to a drunkard? a man\nwho drinks raw alcohol? a man who sleeps with rattle snakes? Get out\nof my house or I will kick you out for your impudence.” And Ole began\nlooking anxiously for his feet.\n\nCanute answered not a word, but he put on his hat and went out into the\nkitchen. He went up to Lena and said without looking at her, “Get your\nthings on and come with me!”\n\nThe tones of his voice startled her, and she said angrily, dropping the\nsoap, “Are you drunk?”\n\n“If you do not come with me, I will take you--you had better come,” said\nCanute quietly.\n\nShe lifted a sheet to strike him, but he caught her arm roughly and\nwrenched the sheet from her. He turned to the wall and took down a hood\nand shawl that hung there, and began wrapping her up. Lena scratched\nand fought like a wild thing. Ole stood in the door, cursing, and Mary\nhowled and screeched at the top of her voice. As for Canute, he\nlifted the girl in his arms and went out of the house. She kicked and\nstruggled, but the helpless wailing of Mary and Ole soon died away in\nthe distance, and her face was held down tightly on Canute's shoulder so\nthat she could not see whither he was taking her. She was conscious only\nof the north wind whistling in her ears, and of rapid steady motion and\nof a great breast that heaved beneath her in quick, irregular breaths.\nThe harder she struggled the tighter those iron arms that had held the\nheels of horses crushed about her, until she felt as if they would crush\nthe breath from her, and lay still with fear. Canute was striding across\nthe level fields at a pace at which man never went before, drawing the\nstinging north winds into his lungs in great gulps. He walked with his\neyes half closed and looking straight in front of him, only lowering\nthem when he bent his head to blow away the snow flakes that settled\non her hair. So it was that Canute took her to his home, even as his\nbearded barbarian ancestors took the fair frivolous women of the South\nin their hairy arms and bore them down to their war ships. For ever and\nanon the soul becomes weary of the conventions that are not of it, and\nwith a single stroke shatters the civilized lies with which it is unable\nto cope, and the strong arm reaches out and takes by force what it\ncannot win by cunning.\n\nWhen Canute reached his shanty he placed the girl upon a chair, where\nshe sat sobbing. He stayed only a few minutes. He filled the stove\nwith wood and lit the lamp, drank a huge swallow of alcohol and put the\nbottle in his pocket. He paused a moment, staring heavily at the weeping\ngirl, then he went off and locked the door and disappeared in the\ngathering gloom of the night.\n\nWrapped in flannels and soaked with turpentine, the little Norwegian\npreacher sat reading his Bible, when he heard a thundering knock at his\ndoor, and Canute entered, covered with snow and his beard frozen fast to\nhis coat.\n\n“Come in, Canute, you must be frozen,” said the little man, shoving a\nchair towards his visitor.\n\nCanute remained standing with his hat on and said quietly, “I want you\nto come over to my house tonight to marry me to Lena Yensen.”\n\n“Have you got a license, Canute?”\n\n“No, I don't want a license. I want to be married.”\n\n“But I can't marry you without a license, man, it would not be legal.”\n\nA dangerous light came in the big Norwegian's eye. “I want you to come\nover to my house to marry me to Lena Yensen.”\n\n“No, I can't, it would kill an ox to go out in a storm like this, and my\nrheumatism is bad tonight.”\n\n“Then if you will not go I must take you,” said Canute with a sigh.\n\nHe took down the preacher's bearskin coat and bade him put it on while\nhe hitched up his buggy. He went out and closed the door softly after\nhim. Presently he returned and found the frightened minister crouching\nbefore the fire with his coat lying beside him. Canute helped him put it\non and gently wrapped his head in his big muffler. Then he picked him\nup and carried him out and placed him in his buggy. As he tucked the\nbuffalo robes around him he said: “Your horse is old, he might flounder\nor lose his way in this storm. I will lead him.”\n\nThe minister took the reins feebly in his hands and sat shivering with\nthe cold. Sometimes when there was a lull in the wind, he could see the\nhorse struggling through the snow with the man plodding steadily beside\nhim. Again the blowing snow would hide them from him altogether. He had\nno idea where they were or what direction they were going. He felt as\nthough he were being whirled away in the heart of the storm, and he said\nall the prayers he knew. But at last the long four miles were over, and\nCanute set him down in the snow while he unlocked the door. He saw the\nbride sitting by the fire with her eyes red and swollen as though\nshe had been weeping. Canute placed a huge chair for him, and said\nroughly,--\n\n“Warm yourself.”\n\nLena began to cry and moan afresh, begging the minister to take her\nhome. He looked helplessly at Canute. Canute said simply,\n\n“If you are warm now, you can marry us.”\n\n“My daughter, do you take this step of your own free will?” asked the\nminister in a trembling voice.\n\n“No, sir, I don't, and it is disgraceful he should force me into it! I\nwon't marry him.”\n\n“Then, Canute, I cannot marry you,” said the minister, standing as\nstraight as his rheumatic limbs would let him.\n\n“Are you ready to marry us now, sir?” said Canute, laying one iron hand\non his stooped shoulder. The little preacher was a good man, but like\nmost men of weak body he was a coward and had a horror of physical\nsuffering, although he had known so much of it. So with many qualms of\nconscience he began to repeat the marriage service. Lena sat sullenly in\nher chair, staring at the fire. Canute stood beside her, listening with\nhis head bent reverently and his hands folded on his breast. When the\nlittle man had prayed and said amen, Canute began bundling him up again.\n\n“I will take you home, now,” he said as he carried him out and placed\nhim in his buggy, and started off with him through the fury of the\nstorm, floundering among the snow drifts that brought even the giant\nhimself to his knees.\n\nAfter she was left alone, Lena soon ceased weeping. She was not of a\nparticularly sensitive temperament, and had little pride beyond that of\nvanity. After the first bitter anger wore itself out, she felt nothing\nmore than a healthy sense of humiliation and defeat. She had no\ninclination to run away, for she was married now, and in her eyes\nthat was final and all rebellion was useless. She knew nothing about\na license, but she knew that a preacher married folks. She consoled\nherself by thinking that she had always intended to marry Canute\nsomeday, anyway.\n\nShe grew tired of crying and looking into the fire, so she got up and\nbegan to look about her. She had heard queer tales about the inside of\nCanute's shanty, and her curiosity soon got the better of her rage.\nOne of the first things she noticed was the new black suit of clothes\nhanging on the wall. She was dull, but it did not take a vain woman long\nto interpret anything so decidedly flattering, and she was pleased in\nspite of herself. As she looked through the cupboard, the general air of\nneglect and discomfort made her pity the man who lived there.\n\n“Poor fellow, no wonder he wants to get married to get somebody to wash\nup his dishes. Batchin's pretty hard on a man.”\n\nIt is easy to pity when once one's vanity has been tickled. She looked\nat the windowsill and gave a little shudder and wondered if the man were\ncrazy. Then she sat down again and sat a long time wondering what her\nDick and Ole would do.\n\n“It is queer Dick didn't come right over after me. He surely came, for\nhe would have left town before the storm began and he might just as\nwell come right on as go back. If he'd hurried he would have gotten here\nbefore the preacher came. I suppose he was afraid to come, for he\nknew Canuteson could pound him to jelly, the coward!” Her eyes flashed\nangrily.\n\nThe weary hours wore on and Lena began to grow horribly lonesome. It was\nan uncanny night and this was an uncanny place to be in. She could\nhear the coyotes howling hungrily a little way from the cabin, and more\nterrible still were all the unknown noises of the storm. She remembered\nthe tales they told of the big log overhead and she was afraid of those\nsnaky things on the windowsills. She remembered the man who had been\nkilled in the draw, and she wondered what she would do if she saw crazy\nLou's white face glaring into the window. The rattling of the door\nbecame unbearable, she thought the latch must be loose and took the\nlamp to look at it. Then for the first time she saw the ugly brown snake\nskins whose death rattle sounded every time the wind jarred the door.\n\n“Canute, Canute!” she screamed in terror.\n\nOutside the door she heard a heavy sound as of a big dog getting up and\nshaking himself. The door opened and Canute stood before her, white as a\nsnow drift.\n\n“What is it?” he asked kindly.\n\n“I am cold,” she faltered.\n\nHe went out and got an armful of wood and a basket of cobs and filled\nthe stove. Then he went out and lay in the snow before the door.\nPresently he heard her calling again.\n\n“What is it?” he said, sitting up.\n\n“I'm so lonesome, I'm afraid to stay in here all alone.”\n\n“I will go over and get your mother.” And he got up.\n\n“She won't come.”\n\n“I'll bring her,” said Canute grimly.\n\n“No, no. I don't want her, she will scold all the time.”\n\n“Well, I will bring your father.”\n\nShe spoke again and it seemed as though her mouth was close up to the\nkey-hole. She spoke lower than he had ever heard her speak before, so\nlow that he had to put his ear up to the lock to hear her.\n\n“I don't want him either, Canute,--I'd rather have you.”\n\nFor a moment she heard no noise at all, then something like a groan.\nWith a cry of fear she opened the door, and saw Canute stretched in the\nsnow at her feet, his face in his hands, sobbing on the doorstep.\n\n\n\n\n\nEric Hermannson's Soul\n\n\nIt was a great night at the Lone Star schoolhouse--a night when the\nSpirit was present with power and when God was very near to man. So\nit seemed to Asa Skinner, servant of God and Free Gospeller. The\nschoolhouse was crowded with the saved and sanctified, robust men\nand women, trembling and quailing before the power of some mysterious\npsychic force. Here and there among this cowering, sweating multitude\ncrouched some poor wretch who had felt the pangs of an awakened\nconscience, but had not yet experienced that complete divestment of\nreason, that frenzy born of a convulsion of the mind, which, in the\nparlance of the Free Gospellers, is termed “the Light.” On the floor\nbefore the mourners' bench lay the unconscious figure of a man in whom\noutraged nature had sought her last resort. This “trance” state is the\nhighest evidence of grace among the Free Gospellers, and indicates a\nclose walking with God.\n\nBefore the desk stood Asa Skinner, shouting of the mercy and vengeance\nof God, and in his eyes shone a terrible earnestness, an almost\nprophetic flame. Asa was a converted train gambler who used to run\nbetween Omaha and Denver. He was a man made for the extremes of life;\nfrom the most debauched of men he had become the most ascetic. His was a\nbestial face, a face that bore the stamp of Nature's eternal injustice.\nThe forehead was low, projecting over the eyes, and the sandy hair was\nplastered down over it and then brushed back at an abrupt right angle.\nThe chin was heavy, the nostrils were low and wide, and the lower lip\nhung loosely except in his moments of spasmodic earnestness, when it\nshut like a steel trap. Yet about those coarse features there were\ndeep, rugged furrows, the scars of many a hand-to-hand struggle with the\nweakness of the flesh, and about that drooping lip were sharp, strenuous\nlines that had conquered it and taught it to pray. Over those seamed\ncheeks there was a certain pallor, a greyness caught from many a vigil.\nIt was as though, after Nature had done her worst with that face, some\nfine chisel had gone over it, chastening and almost transfiguring it.\nTonight, as his muscles twitched with emotion, and the perspiration\ndropped from his hair and chin, there was a certain convincing power\nin the man. For Asa Skinner was a man possessed of a belief, of that\nsentiment of the sublime before which all inequalities are leveled, that\ntransport of conviction which seems superior to all laws of condition,\nunder which debauchees have become martyrs; which made a tinker an\nartist and a camel-driver the founder of an empire. This was with Asa\nSkinner tonight, as he stood proclaiming the vengeance of God.\n\nIt might have occurred to an impartial observer that Asa Skinner's God\nwas indeed a vengeful God if he could reserve vengeance for those of\nhis creatures who were packed into the Lone Star schoolhouse that night.\nPoor exiles of all nations; men from the south and the north, peasants\nfrom almost every country of Europe, most of them from the mountainous,\nnight-bound coast of Norway. Honest men for the most part, but men with\nwhom the world had dealt hardly; the failures of all countries, men\nsobered by toil and saddened by exile, who had been driven to fight for\nthe dominion of an untoward soil, to sow where others should gather, the\nadvance guard of a mighty civilization to be.\n\nNever had Asa Skinner spoken more earnestly than now. He felt that\nthe Lord had this night a special work for him to do. Tonight Eric\nHermannson, the wildest lad on all the Divide, sat in his audience with\na fiddle on his knee, just as he had dropped in on his way to play for\nsome dance. The violin is an object of particular abhorrence to the Free\nGospellers. Their antagonism to the church organ is bitter enough, but\nthe fiddle they regard as a very incarnation of evil desires, singing\nforever of worldly pleasures and inseparably associated with all\nforbidden things.\n\nEric Hermannson had long been the object of the prayers of the\nrevivalists. His mother had felt the power of the Spirit weeks ago, and\nspecial prayer-meetings had been held at her house for her son. But\nEric had only gone his ways laughing, the ways of youth, which are short\nenough at best, and none too flowery on the Divide.\n\nHe slipped away from the prayer-meetings to meet the Campbell boys in\nGenereau's saloon, or hug the plump little French girls at Chevalier's\ndances, and sometimes, of a summer night, he even went across the dewy\ncornfields and through the wild-plum thicket to play the fiddle for Lena\nHanson, whose name was a reproach through all the Divide country, where\nthe women are usually too plain and too busy and too tired to depart\nfrom the ways of virtue. On such occasions Lena, attired in a pink\nwrapper and silk stockings and tiny pink slippers, would sing to him,\naccompanying herself on a battered guitar. It gave him a delicious sense\nof freedom and experience to be with a woman who, no matter how, had\nlived in big cities and knew the ways of town folk, who had never worked\nin the fields and had kept her hands white and soft, her throat fair\nand tender, who had heard great singers in Denver and Salt Lake, and who\nknew the strange language of flattery and idleness and mirth.\n\nYet, careless as he seemed, the frantic prayers of his mother were not\naltogether without their effect upon Eric. For days he had been fleeing\nbefore them as a criminal from his pursuers, and over his pleasures had\nfallen the shadow of something dark and terrible that dogged his steps.\nThe harder he danced, the louder he sang, the more was he conscious that\nthis phantom was gaining upon him, that in time it would track him down.\nOne Sunday afternoon, late in the fall, when he had been drinking beer\nwith Lena Hanson and listening to a song which made his cheeks burn, a\nrattlesnake had crawled out of the side of the sod house and thrust its\nugly head in under the screen door. He was not afraid of snakes, but he\nknew enough of Gospellism to feel the significance of the reptile lying\ncoiled there upon her doorstep. His lips were cold when he kissed Lena\ngoodbye, and he went there no more.\n\nThe final barrier between Eric and his mother's faith was his violin,\nand to that he clung as a man sometimes will cling to his dearest sin,\nto the weakness more precious to him than all his strength, In the great\nworld beauty comes to men in many guises, and art in a hundred forms,\nbut for Eric there was only his violin.\n\nIt stood, to him, for all the manifestations of art; it was his only\nbridge into the kingdom of the soul.\n\nIt was to Eric Hermannson that the evangelist directed his impassioned\npleading that night.\n\n“_Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?_ Is there a Saul here tonight\nwho has stopped his ears to that gentle pleading, who has thrust a spear\ninto that bleeding side? Think of it, my brother; you are offered this\nwonderful love and you prefer the worm that dieth not and the fire which\nwill not be quenched. What right have you to lose one of God's precious\nsouls? _Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?_”\n\nA great joy dawned in Asa Skinner's pale face, for he saw that Eric\nHermannson was swaying to and fro in his seat. The minister fell upon\nhis knees and threw his long arms up over his head.\n\n“O my brothers! I feel it coming, the blessing we have prayed for. I\ntell you the Spirit is coming! just a little more prayer, brothers, a\nlittle more zeal, and he will be here. I can feel his cooling wing upon\nmy brow. Glory be to God forever and ever, amen!”\n\nThe whole congregation groaned under the pressure of this spiritual\npanic. Shouts and hallelujahs went up from every lip. Another figure\nfell prostrate upon the floor. From the mourners' bench rose a chant of\nterror and rapture:\n\n\n            “Eating honey and drinking wine,\n            _Glory to the bleeding Lamb!_\n            I am my Lord's and he is mine,\n            _Glory to the bleeding Lamb!”_\n\n\nThe hymn was sung in a dozen dialects and voiced all the vague yearning\nof these hungry lives, of these people who had starved all the passions\nso long, only to fall victims to the barest of them all, fear.\n\nA groan of ultimate anguish rose from Eric Hermannson's bowed head,\nand the sound was like the groan of a great tree when it falls in the\nforest.\n\nThe minister rose suddenly to his feet and threw back his head, crying\nin a loud voice:\n\n“_Lazarus, come forth!_ Eric Hermannson, you are lost, going down at\nsea. In the name of God, and Jesus Christ his Son, I throw you the life\nline. Take hold! Almighty God, my soul for his!” The minister threw his\narms out and lifted his quivering face.\n\nEric Hermannson rose to his feet; his lips were set and the lightning\nwas in his eyes. He took his violin by the neck and crushed it to\nsplinters across his knee, and to Asa Skinner the sound was like the\nshackles of sin broken audibly asunder.\n\n\n\n                              II\n\nFor more than two years Eric Hermannson kept the austere faith to which\nhe had sworn himself, kept it until a girl from the East came to spend\na week on the Nebraska Divide. She was a girl of other manners and\nconditions, and there were greater distances between her life and Eric's\nthan all the miles which separated Rattlesnake Creek from New York City.\nIndeed, she had no business to be in the West at all; but ah! across\nwhat leagues of land and sea, by what improbable chances, do the\nunrelenting gods bring to us our fate!\n\nIt was in a year of financial depression that Wyllis Elliot came to\nNebraska to buy cheap land and revisit the country where he had spent\na year of his youth. When he had graduated from Harvard it was still\ncustomary for moneyed gentlemen to send their scapegrace sons to rough\nit on ranches in the wilds of Nebraska or Dakota, or to consign them to\na living death in the sagebrush of the Black Hills. These young men did\nnot always return to the ways of civilized life. But Wyllis Elliot had\nnot married a half-breed, nor been shot in a cowpunchers' brawl, nor\nwrecked by bad whisky, nor appropriated by a smirched adventuress. He\nhad been saved from these things by a girl, his sister, who had been\nvery near to his life ever since the days when they read fairy tales\ntogether and dreamed the dreams that never come true. On this, his\nfirst visit to his father's ranch since he left it six years before, he\nbrought her with him. She had been laid up half the winter from a sprain\nreceived while skating, and had had too much time for reflection during\nthose months. She was restless and filled with a desire to see something\nof the wild country of which her brother had told her so much. She was\nto be married the next winter, and Wyllis understood her when she\nbegged him to take her with him on this long, aimless jaunt across the\ncontinent, to taste the last of their freedom together. It comes to all\nwomen of her type--that desire to taste the unknown which allures and\nterrifies, to run one's whole soul's length out to the wind--just once.\n\nIt had been an eventful journey. Wyllis somehow understood that strain\nof gypsy blood in his sister, and he knew where to take her. They had\nslept in sod houses on the Platte River, made the acquaintance of the\npersonnel of a third-rate opera company on the train to Deadwood, dined\nin a camp of railroad constructors at the world's end beyond New Castle,\ngone through the Black Hills on horseback, fished for trout in Dome\nLake, watched a dance at Cripple Creek, where the lost souls who hide\nin the hills gathered for their besotted revelry. And now, last of all,\nbefore the return to thraldom, there was this little shack, anchored on\nthe windy crest of the Divide, a little black dot against the flaming\nsunsets, a scented sea of cornland bathed in opalescent air and blinding\nsunlight.\n\nMargaret Elliot was one of those women of whom there are so many in this\nday, when old order, passing, giveth place to new; beautiful, talented,\ncritical, unsatisfied, tired of the world at twenty-four. For the moment\nthe life and people of the Divide interested her. She was there but a\nweek; perhaps had she stayed longer, that inexorable ennui which travels\nfaster even than the Vestibule Limited would have overtaken her. The\nweek she tarried there was the week that Eric Hermannson was helping\nJerry Lockhart thresh; a week earlier or a week later, and there would\nhave been no story to write.\n\nIt was on Thursday and they were to leave on Saturday. Wyllis and his\nsister were sitting on the wide piazza of the ranchhouse, staring out\ninto the afternoon sunlight and protesting against the gusts of hot wind\nthat blew up from the sandy riverbottom twenty miles to the southward.\n\nThe young man pulled his cap lower over his eyes and remarked:\n\n“This wind is the real thing; you don't strike it anywhere else. You\nremember we had a touch of it in Algiers and I told you it came from\nKansas. It's the keynote of this country.”\n\nWyllis touched her hand that lay on the hammock and continued gently:\n\n“I hope it's paid you, Sis. Roughing it's dangerous business; it takes\nthe taste out of things.”\n\nShe shut her fingers firmly over the brown hand that was so like her\nown.\n\n“Paid? Why, Wyllis, I haven't been so happy since we were children and\nwere going to discover the ruins of Troy together some day. Do you know,\nI believe I could just stay on here forever and let the world go on its\nown gait. It seems as though the tension and strain we used to talk of\nlast winter were gone for good, as though one could never give one's\nstrength out to such petty things any more.”\n\nWyllis brushed the ashes of his pipe away from the silk handkerchief\nthat was knotted about his neck and stared moodily off at the skyline.\n\n“No, you're mistaken. This would bore you after a while. You can't shake\nthe fever of the other life. I've tried it. There was a time when the\ngay fellows of Rome could trot down into the Thebaid and burrow into the\nsandhills and get rid of it. But it's all too complex now. You see\nwe've made our dissipations so dainty and respectable that they've\ngone further in than the flesh, and taken hold of the ego proper. You\ncouldn't rest, even here. The war cry would follow you.”\n\n“You don't waste words, Wyllis, but you never miss fire. I talk more\nthan you do, without saying half so much. You must have learned the art\nof silence from these taciturn Norwegians. I think I like silent men.”\n\n“Naturally,” said Wyllis, “since you have decided to marry the most\nbrilliant talker you know.”\n\nBoth were silent for a time, listening to the sighing of the hot wind\nthrough the parched morning-glory vines. Margaret spoke first.\n\n“Tell me, Wyllis, were many of the Norwegians you used to know as\ninteresting as Eric Hermannson?”\n\n“Who, Siegfried? Well, no. He used to be the flower of the Norwegian\nyouth in my day, and he's rather an exception, even now. He has\nretrograded, though. The bonds of the soil have tightened on him, I\nfancy.”\n\n“Siegfried? Come, that's rather good, Wyllis. He looks like a\ndragon-slayer. What is it that makes him so different from the others? I\ncan talk to him; he seems quite like a human being.”\n\n “Well,” said Wyllis, meditatively, “I don't read Bourget\nas much as my cultured sister, and I'm not so well up in analysis, but\nI fancy it's because one keeps cherishing a perfectly unwarranted\nsuspicion that under that big, hulking anatomy of his, he may conceal a\nsoul somewhere. _Nicht wahr?_”\n\n“Something like that,” said Margaret, thoughtfully, “except that it's\nmore than a suspicion, and it isn't groundless. He has one, and he makes\nit known, somehow, without speaking.”\n\n“I always have my doubts about loquacious souls,” Wyllis remarked, with\nthe unbelieving smile that had grown habitual with him.\n\nMargaret went on, not heeding the interruption. “I knew it from the\nfirst, when he told me about the suicide of his cousin, the Bernstein\nboy. That kind of blunt pathos can't be summoned at will in anybody. The\nearlier novelists rose to it, sometimes, unconsciously. But last night\nwhen I sang for him I was doubly sure. Oh, I haven't told you about that\nyet! Better light your pipe again. You see, he stumbled in on me in the\ndark when I was pumping away at that old parlour organ to please Mrs.\nLockhart It's her household fetish and I've forgotten how many pounds of\nbutter she made and sold to buy it. Well, Eric stumbled in, and in some\ninarticulate manner made me understand that he wanted me to sing for\nhim. I sang just the old things, of course. It's queer to sing familiar\nthings here at the world's end. It makes one think how the hearts of men\nhave carried them around the world, into the wastes of Iceland and the\njungles of Africa and the islands of the Pacific. I think if one lived\nhere long enough one would quite forget how to be trivial, and would\nread only the great books that we never get time to read in the world,\nand would remember only the great music, and the things that are really\nworth while would stand out clearly against that horizon over there. And\nof course I played the intermezzo from _Cavalleria Rusticana_ for him;\nit goes rather better on an organ than most things do. He shuffled his\nfeet and twisted his big hands up into knots and blurted out that he\ndidn't know there was any music like that in the world. Why, there were\ntears in his voice, Wyllis! Yes, like Rossetti, I _heard_ his tears.\nThen it dawned upon me that it was probably the first good music he had\never heard in all his life. Think of it, to care for music as he does\nand never to hear it, never to know that it exists on earth! To long\nfor it as we long for other perfect experiences that never come. I\ncan't tell you what music means to that man. I never saw any one so\nsusceptible to it. It gave him speech, he became alive. When I had\nfinished the intermezzo, he began telling me about a little crippled\nbrother who died and whom he loved and used to carry everywhere in his\narms. He did not wait for encouragement. He took up the story and told\nit slowly, as if to himself, just sort of rose up and told his own woe\nto answer Mascagni's. It overcame me.”\n\n“Poor devil,” said Wyllis, looking at her with mysterious eyes, “and so\nyou've given him a new woe. Now he'll go on wanting Grieg and\nSchubert the rest of his days and never getting them. That's a girl's\nphilanthropy for you!”\n\nJerry Lockhart came out of the house screwing his chin over the unusual\nluxury of a stiff white collar, which his wife insisted upon as a\nnecessary article of toilet while Miss Elliot was at the house. Jerry\nsat down on the step and smiled his broad, red smile at Margaret.\n\n“Well, I've got the music for your dance, Miss Elliot. Olaf Oleson\nwill bring his accordion and Mollie will play the organ, when she isn't\nlookin' after the grub, and a little chap from Frenchtown will bring his\nfiddle--though the French don't mix with the Norwegians much.”\n\n“Delightful! Mr. Lockhart, that dance will be the feature of our trip,\nand it's so nice of you to get it up for us. We'll see the Norwegians in\ncharacter at last,” cried Margaret, cordially.\n\n“See here, Lockhart, I'll settle with you for backing her in this\nscheme,” said Wyllis, sitting up and knocking the ashes out of his pipe.\n“She's done crazy things enough on this trip, but to talk of dancing all\nnight with a gang of half-mad Norwegians and taking the carriage at four\nto catch the six o'clock train out of Riverton--well, it's tommyrot,\nthat's what it is!”\n\n“Wyllis, I leave it to your sovereign power of reason to decide whether\nit isn't easier to stay up all night than to get up at three in the\nmorning. To get up at three, think what that means! No, sir, I prefer to\nkeep my vigil and then get into a sleeper.”\n\n“But what do you want with the Norwegians? I thought you were tired of\ndancing.”\n\n“So I am, with some people. But I want to see a Norwegian dance, and I\nintend to. Come, Wyllis, you know how seldom it is that one really wants\nto do anything nowadays. I wonder when I have really wanted to go to a\nparty before. It will be something to remember next month at Newport,\nwhen we have to and don't want to. Remember your own theory that\ncontrast is about the only thing that makes life endurable. This is my\nparty and Mr. Lockhart's; your whole duty tomorrow night will consist in\nbeing nice to the Norwegian girls. I'll warrant you were adept enough\nat it once. And you'd better be very nice indeed, for if there are many\nsuch young Valkyries as Eric's sister among them, they would simply tie\nyou up in a knot if they suspected you were guying them.”\n\nWyllis groaned and sank back into the hammock to consider his fate,\nwhile his sister went on.\n\n“And the guests, Mr. Lockhart, did they accept?”\n\nLockhart took out his knife and began sharpening it on the sole of his\nplowshoe.\n\n“Well, I guess we'll have a couple dozen. You see it's pretty hard to\nget a crowd together here any more. Most of 'em have gone over to the\nFree Gospellers, and they'd rather put their feet in the fire than shake\n'em to a fiddle.”\n\nMargaret made a gesture of impatience. “Those Free Gospellers have just\ncast an evil spell over this country, haven't they?”\n\n“Well,” said Lockhart, cautiously, “I don't just like to pass judgment\non any Christian sect, but if you're to know the chosen by their works,\nthe Gospellers can't make a very proud showin', an' that's a fact.\nThey're responsible for a few suicides, and they've sent a good-sized\ndelegation to the state insane asylum, an' I don't see as they've made\nthe rest of us much better than we were before. I had a little herdboy\nlast spring, as square a little Dane as I want to work for me, but after\nthe Gospellers got hold of him and sanctified him, the little beggar\nused to get down on his knees out on the prairie and pray by the hour\nand let the cattle get into the corn, an' I had to fire him. That's\nabout the way it goes. Now there's Eric; that chap used to be a hustler\nand the spryest dancer in all this section-called all the dances. Now\nhe's got no ambition and he's glum as a preacher. I don't suppose we can\neven get him to come in tomorrow night.”\n\n“Eric? Why, he must dance, we can't let him off,” said Margaret,\nquickly. “Why, I intend to dance with him myself.”\n\n“I'm afraid he won't dance. I asked him this morning if he'd help us out\nand he said, 'I don't dance now, any more,'” said Lockhart, imitating\nthe laboured English of the Norwegian.\n\n“'The Miller of Hofbau, the Miller of Hofbau, O my Princess!'” chirped\nWyllis, cheerfully, from his hammock.\n\nThe red on his sister's cheek deepened a little, and she laughed\nmischievously. “We'll see about that, sir. I'll not admit that I am\nbeaten until I have asked him myself.”\n\nEvery night Eric rode over to St. Anne, a little village in the heart\nof the French settlement, for the mail. As the road lay through the most\nattractive part of the Divide country, on several occasions Margaret\nElliot and her brother had accompanied him. Tonight Wyllis had business\nwith Lockhart, and Margaret rode with Eric, mounted on a frisky little\nmustang that Mrs. Lockhart had broken to the sidesaddle. Margaret\nregarded her escort very much as she did the servant who always\naccompanied her on long rides at home, and the ride to the village was\na silent one. She was occupied with thoughts of another world, and Eric\nwas wrestling with more thoughts than had ever been crowded into his\nhead before.\n\nHe rode with his eyes riveted on that slight figure before him, as\nthough he wished to absorb it through the optic nerves and hold it in\nhis brain forever. He understood the situation perfectly. His brain\nworked slowly, but he had a keen sense of the values of things. This\ngirl represented an entirely new species of humanity to him, but he knew\nwhere to place her. The prophets of old, when an angel first appeared\nunto them, never doubted its high origin.\n\nEric was patient under the adverse conditions of his life, but he\nwas not servile. The Norse blood in him had not entirely lost its\nself-reliance. He came of a proud fisher line, men who were not afraid\nof anything but the ice and the devil, and he had prospects before him\nwhen his father went down off the North Cape in the long Arctic night,\nand his mother, seized by a violent horror of seafaring life, had\nfollowed her brother to America. Eric was eighteen then, handsome as\nyoung Siegfried, a giant in stature, with a skin singularly pure and\ndelicate, like a Swede's; hair as yellow as the locks of Tennyson's\namorous Prince, and eyes of a fierce, burning blue, whose flash was most\ndangerous to women.\n\nHe had in those days a certain pride of bearing, a certain confidence of\napproach, that usually accompanies physical perfection. It was even said\nof him then that he was in love with life, and inclined to levity, a\nvice most unusual on the Divide. But the sad history of those Norwegian\nexiles, transplanted in an arid soil and under a scorching sun, had\nrepeated itself in his case. Toil and isolation had sobered him, and\nhe grew more and more like the clods among which he laboured. It was as\nthough some red-hot instrument had touched for a moment those delicate\nfibers of the brain which respond to acute pain or pleasure, in which\nlies the power of exquisite sensation, and had seared them quite away.\nIt is a painful thing to watch the light die out of the eyes of those\nNorsemen, leaving an expression of impenetrable sadness, quite passive,\nquite hopeless, a shadow that is never lifted. With some this change\ncomes almost at once, in the first bitterness of homesickness, with\nothers it comes more slowly, according to the time it takes each man's\nheart to die.\n\nOh, those poor Northmen of the Divide! They are dead many a year before\nthey are put to rest in the little graveyard on the windy hill where\nexiles of all nations grow akin.\n\nThe peculiar species of hypochondria to which the exiles of his people\nsooner or later succumb had not developed in Eric until that night at\nthe Lone Star schoolhouse, when he had broken his violin across his\nknee. After that, the gloom of his people settled down upon him, and the\ngospel of maceration began its work.\n\n_“If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out,”_ et cetera. The pagan smile\nthat once hovered about his lips was gone, and he was one with sorrow.\nReligion heals a hundred hearts for one that it embitters, but when it\ndestroys, its work is quick and deadly, and where the agony of the cross\nhas been, joy will not come again. This man understood things literally:\none must live without pleasure to die without fear; to save the soul, it\nwas necessary to starve the soul.\n\nThe sun hung low above the cornfields when Margaret and her cavalier\nleft St. Anne. South of the town there is a stretch of road that runs\nfor some three miles through the French settlement, where the prairie\nis as level as the surface of a lake. There the fields of flax and\nwheat and rye are bordered by precise rows of slender, tapering Lombard\npoplars. It was a yellow world that Margaret Elliot saw under the wide\nlight of the setting sun.\n\nThe girl gathered up her reins and called back to Eric, “It will be safe\nto run the horses here, won't it?”\n\n“Yes, I think so, now,” he answered, touching his spur to his pony's\nflank. They were off like the wind. It is an old saying in the West that\nnewcomers always ride a horse or two to death before they get broken\nin to the country. They are tempted by the great open spaces and try to\noutride the horizon, to get to the end of something. Margaret galloped\nover the level road, and Eric, from behind, saw her long veil fluttering\nin the wind. It had fluttered just so in his dreams last night and the\nnight before. With a sudden inspiration of courage he overtook her and\nrode beside her, looking intently at her half-averted face. Before, he\nhad only stolen occasional glances at it, seen it in blinding flashes,\nalways with more or less embarrassment, but now he determined to let\nevery line of it sink into his memory. Men of the world would have said\nthat it was an unusual face, nervous, finely cut, with clear, elegant\nlines that betokened ancestry. Men of letters would have called it a\nhistoric face, and would have conjectured at what old passions, long\nasleep, what old sorrows forgotten time out of mind, doing battle\ntogether in ages gone, had curved those delicate nostrils, left their\nunconscious memory in those eyes. But Eric read no meaning in these\ndetails. To him this beauty was something more than colour and line;\nit was a flash of white light, in which one cannot distinguish colour\nbecause all colours are there. To him it was a complete revelation, an\nembodiment of those dreams of impossible loveliness that linger by a\nyoung man's pillow on midsummer nights; yet, because it held something\nmore than the attraction of health and youth and shapeliness, it\ntroubled him, and in its presence he felt as the Goths before the white\nmarbles in the Roman Capitol, not knowing whether they were men or gods.\nAt times he felt like uncovering his head before it, again the fury\nseized him to break and despoil, to find the clay in this spirit-thing\nand stamp upon it. Away from her, he longed to strike out with his arms,\nand take and hold; it maddened him that this woman whom he could break\nin his hands should be so much stronger than he. But near her, he never\nquestioned this strength; he admitted its potentiality as he admitted\nthe miracles of the Bible; it enervated and conquered him.\n\nTonight, when he rode so close to her that he could have touched her, he\nknew that he might as well reach out his hand to take a star.\n\nMargaret stirred uneasily under his gaze and turned questioningly in her\nsaddle.\n\n“This wind puts me a little out of breath when we ride fast,” she said.\n\nEric turned his eyes away.\n\n“I want to ask you if I go to New York to work, if I maybe hear music\nlike you sang last night? I been a purty good hand to work,” he asked,\ntimidly.\n\nMargaret looked at him with surprise, and then, as she studied the\noutline of his face, pityingly.\n\n“Well, you might--but you'd lose a good deal else. I shouldn't like you\nto go to New York--and be poor, you'd be out of atmosphere, some\nway,” she said, slowly. Inwardly she was thinking: _There he would be\naltogether sordid, impossible--a machine who would carry one's trunks\nupstairs, perhaps. Here he is every inch a man, rather picturesque; why\nis it?_ “No,” she added aloud, “I shouldn't like that.”\n\n“Then I not go,” said Eric, decidedly.\n\nMargaret turned her face to hide a smile. She was a trifle amused and a\ntrifle annoyed. Suddenly she spoke again.\n\n“But I'll tell you what I do want you to do, Eric. I want you to dance\nwith us tomorrow night and teach me some of the Norwegian dances; they\nsay you know them all. Won't you?”\n\nEric straightened himself in his saddle and his eyes flashed as they had\ndone in the Lone Star schoolhouse when he broke his violin across his\nknee.\n\n“Yes, I will,” he said, quietly, and he believed that he delivered his\nsoul to hell as he said it.\n\nThey had reached the rougher country now, where the road wound through\na narrow cut in one of the bluffs along the creek, when a beat of hoofs\nahead and the sharp neighing of horses made the ponies start and Eric\nrose in his stirrups. Then down the gulch in front of them and over the\nsteep clay banks thundered a herd of wild ponies, nimble as monkeys and\nwild as rabbits, such as horse-traders drive east from the plains of\nMontana to sell in the farming country. Margaret's pony made a shrill\nsound, a neigh that was almost a scream, and started up the clay bank to\nmeet them, all the wild blood of the range breaking out in an instant.\nMargaret called to Eric just as he threw himself out of the saddle and\ncaught her pony's bit. But the wiry little animal had gone mad and was\nkicking and biting like a devil. Her wild brothers of the range were all\nabout her, neighing, and pawing the earth, and striking her with their\nforefeet and snapping at her flanks. It was the old liberty of the range\nthat the little beast fought for.\n\n“Drop the reins and hold tight, tight!” Eric called, throwing all his\nweight upon the bit, struggling under those frantic forefeet that now\nbeat at his breast, and now kicked at the wild mustangs that surged and\ntossed about him. He succeeded in wrenching the pony's head toward him\nand crowding her withers against the clay bank, so that she could not\nroll.\n\n“Hold tight, tight!” he shouted again, launching a kick at a snorting\nanimal that reared back against Margaret's saddle. If she should lose\nher courage and fall now, under those hoofs--He struck out again and\nagain, kicking right and left with all his might. Already the negligent\ndrivers had galloped into the cut, and their long quirts were whistling\nover the heads of the herd. As suddenly as it had come, the struggling,\nfrantic wave of wild life swept up out of the gulch and on across the\nopen prairie, and with a long despairing whinny of farewell the pony\ndropped her head and stood trembling in her sweat, shaking the foam and\nblood from her bit.\n\nEric stepped close to Margaret's side and laid his hand on her saddle.\n“You are not hurt?” he asked, hoarsely. As he raised his face in the\nsoft starlight she saw that it was white and drawn and that his lips\nwere working nervously.\n\n“No, no, not at all. But you, you are suffering; they struck you!” she\ncried in sharp alarm.\n\nHe stepped back and drew his hand across his brow.\n\n“No, it is not that,” he spoke rapidly now, with his hands clenched at\nhis side. “But if they had hurt you, I would beat their brains out with\nmy hands. I would kill them all. I was never afraid before. You are the\nonly beautiful thing that has ever come close to me. You came like an\nangel out of the sky. You are like the music you sing, you are like the\nstars and the snow on the mountains where I played when I was a little\nboy. You are like all that I wanted once and never had, you are all\nthat they have killed in me. I die for you tonight, tomorrow, for all\neternity. I am not a coward; I was afraid because I love you more than\nChrist who died for me, more than I am afraid of hell, or hope for\nheaven. I was never afraid before. If you had fallen--oh, my God!” He\nthrew his arms out blindly and dropped his head upon the pony's mane,\nleaning limply against the animal like a man struck by some sickness.\nHis shoulders rose and fell perceptibly with his laboured breathing. The\nhorse stood cowed with exhaustion and fear. Presently Margaret laid her\nhand on Eric's head and said gently:\n\n“You are better now, shall we go on? Can you get your horse?”\n\n“No, he has gone with the herd. I will lead yours, she is not safe.\nI will not frighten you again.” His voice was still husky, but it was\nsteady now. He took hold of the bit and tramped home in silence.\n\nWhen they reached the house, Eric stood stolidly by the pony's head\nuntil Wyllis came to lift his sister from the saddle.\n\n“The horses were badly frightened, Wyllis. I think I was pretty\nthoroughly scared myself,” she said as she took her brother's arm and\nwent slowly up the hill toward the house. “No, I'm not hurt, thanks to\nEric. You must thank him for taking such good care of me. He's a mighty\nfine fellow. I'll tell you all about it in the morning, dear. I was\npretty well shaken up and I'm going right to bed now. Good night.”\n\nWhen she reached the low room in which she slept, she sank upon the bed\nin her riding dress, face downward.\n\n“Oh, I pity him! I pity him!” she murmured, with a long sigh of\nexhaustion. She must have slept a little. When she rose again, she took\nfrom her dress a letter that had been waiting for her at the village\npost-office. It was closely written in a long, angular hand, covering a\ndozen pages of foreign note-paper, and began:\n\nMy Dearest Margaret: if I should attempt to say _how like a winter hath\nthine absence been_, I should incur the risk of being tedious. Really,\nit takes the sparkle out of everything. Having nothing better to do, and\nnot caring to go anywhere in particular without you, I remained in the\ncity until Jack Courtwell noted my general despondency and brought me\ndown here to his place on the sound to manage some open-air theatricals\nhe is getting up. _As You Like It_ is of course the piece selected. Miss\nHarrison plays Rosalind. I wish you had been here to take the part. Miss\nHarrison reads her lines well, but she is either a maiden-all-forlorn or\na tomboy; insists on reading into the part all sorts of deeper meanings\nand highly coloured suggestions wholly out of harmony with the pastoral\nsetting. Like most of the professionals, she exaggerates the emotional\nelement and quite fails to do justice to Rosalind's facile wit and\nreally brilliant mental qualities. Gerard will do Orlando, but rumor\nsays he is _epris_ of your sometime friend, Miss Meredith, and his\nmemory is treacherous and his interest fitful.\n\nMy new pictures arrived last week on the _Gascogne_. The Puvis de\nChavannes is even more beautiful than I thought it in Paris. A pale\ndream-maiden sits by a pale dream-cow and a stream of anemic water flows\nat her feet. The Constant, you will remember, I got because you admired\nit. It is here in all its florid splendour, the whole dominated by a\nglowing sensuosity. The drapery of the female figure is as wonderful as\nyou said; the fabric all barbaric pearl and gold, painted with an easy,\neffortless voluptuousness, and that white, gleaming line of African\ncoast in the background recalls memories of you very precious to me. But\nit is useless to deny that Constant irritates me. Though I cannot prove\nthe charge against him, his brilliancy always makes me suspect him of\ncheapness.\n\nHere Margaret stopped and glanced at the remaining pages of this strange\nlove-letter. They seemed to be filled chiefly with discussions of\npictures and books, and with a slow smile she laid them by.\n\nShe rose and began undressing. Before she lay down she went to open the\nwindow. With her hand on the sill, she hesitated, feeling suddenly as\nthough some danger were lurking outside, some inordinate desire waiting\nto spring upon her in the darkness. She stood there for a long time,\ngazing at the infinite sweep of the sky.\n\n“Oh, it is all so little, so little there,” she murmured. “When\neverything else is so dwarfed, why should one expect love to be great?\nWhy should one try to read highly coloured suggestions into a life like\nthat? If only I could find one thing in it all that mattered greatly,\none thing that would warm me when I am alone! Will life never give me\nthat one great moment?”\n\nAs she raised the window, she heard a sound in the plum bushes outside.\nIt was only the house-dog roused from his sleep, but Margaret started\nviolently and trembled so that she caught the foot of the bed for\nsupport. Again she felt herself pursued by some overwhelming longing,\nsome desperate necessity for herself, like the outstretching of\nhelpless, unseen arms in the darkness, and the air seemed heavy with\nsighs of yearning. She fled to her bed with the words, “I love you more\nthan Christ who died for me!” ringing in her ears.\n\n\n                             III\n\nAbout midnight the dance at Lockhart's was at its height. Even the old\nmen who had come to “look on” caught the spirit of revelry and stamped\nthe floor with the vigor of old Silenus. Eric took the violin from the\nFrenchmen, and Minna Oleson sat at the organ, and the music grew more\nand more characteristic--rude, half mournful music, made up of the\nfolksongs of the North, that the villagers sing through the long night\nin hamlets by the sea, when they are thinking of the sun, and the\nspring, and the fishermen so long away. To Margaret some of it sounded\nlike Grieg's _Peer Gynt_ music. She found something irresistibly\ninfectious in the mirth of these people who were so seldom merry, and\nshe felt almost one of them. Something seemed struggling for freedom\nin them tonight, something of the joyous childhood of the nations\nwhich exile had not killed. The girls were all boisterous with delight.\nPleasure came to them but rarely, and when it came, they caught at it\nwildly and crushed its fluttering wings in their strong brown fingers.\nThey had a hard life enough, most of them. Torrid summers and freezing\nwinters, labour and drudgery and ignorance, were the portion of\ntheir girlhood; a short wooing, a hasty, loveless marriage, unlimited\nmaternity, thankless sons, premature age and ugliness, were the dower\nof their womanhood. But what matter? Tonight there was hot liquor in the\nglass and hot blood in the heart; tonight they danced.\n\nTonight Eric Hermannson had renewed his youth. He was no longer the big,\nsilent Norwegian who had sat at Margaret's feet and looked hopelessly\ninto her eyes. Tonight he was a man, with a man's rights and a man's\npower. Tonight he was Siegfried indeed. His hair was yellow as the heavy\nwheat in the ripe of summer, and his eyes flashed like the blue water\nbetween the ice packs in the north seas. He was not afraid of Margaret\ntonight, and when he danced with her he held her firmly. She was tired\nand dragged on his arm a little, but the strength of the man was like\nan all-pervading fluid, stealing through her veins, awakening under her\nheart some nameless, unsuspected existence that had slumbered there all\nthese years and that went out through her throbbing fingertips to his\nthat answered. She wondered if the hoydenish blood of some lawless\nancestor, long asleep, were calling out in her tonight, some drop of\na hotter fluid that the centuries had failed to cool, and why, if this\ncurse were in her, it had not spoken before. But was it a curse, this\nawakening, this wealth before undiscovered, this music set free? For the\nfirst time in her life her heart held something stronger than herself,\nwas not this worthwhile? Then she ceased to wonder. She lost sight of\nthe lights and the faces and the music was drowned by the beating of her\nown arteries. She saw only the blue eyes that flashed above her, felt\nonly the warmth of that throbbing hand which held hers and which the\nblood of his heart fed. Dimly, as in a dream, she saw the drooping\nshoulders, high white forehead and tight, cynical mouth of the man she\nwas to marry in December. For an hour she had been crowding back the\nmemory of that face with all her strength.\n\n“Let us stop, this is enough,” she whispered. His only answer was to\ntighten the arm behind her. She sighed and let that masterful strength\nbear her where it would. She forgot that this man was little more than\na savage, that they would part at dawn. The blood has no memories, no\nreflections, no regrets for the past, no consideration of the future.\n\n“Let us go out where it is cooler,” she said when the music stopped;\nthinking, _I am growing faint here, I shall be all right in the open\nair_. They stepped out into the cool, blue air of the night.\n\nSince the older folk had begun dancing, the young Norwegians had been\nslipping out in couples to climb the windmill tower into the cooler\natmosphere, as is their custom.\n\n“You like to go up?” asked Eric, close to her ear.\n\nShe turned and looked at him with suppressed amusement. “How high is\nit?”\n\n“Forty feet, about. I not let you fall.” There was a note of\nirresistible pleading in his voice, and she felt that he tremendously\nwished her to go. Well, why not? This was a night of the unusual, when\nshe was not herself at all, but was living an unreality. Tomorrow, yes,\nin a few hours, there would be the Vestibule Limited and the world.\n\n“Well, if you'll take good care of me. I used to be able to climb, when\nI was a little girl.”\n\nOnce at the top and seated on the platform, they were silent. Margaret\nwondered if she would not hunger for that scene all her life, through\nall the routine of the days to come. Above them stretched the great\nWestern sky, serenely blue, even in the night, with its big, burning\nstars, never so cold and dead and far away as in denser atmospheres. The\nmoon would not be up for twenty minutes yet, and all about the horizon,\nthat wide horizon, which seemed to reach around the world, lingered a\npale white light, as of a universal dawn. The weary wind brought up to\nthem the heavy odours of the cornfields. The music of the dance sounded\nfaintly from below. Eric leaned on his elbow beside her, his legs\nswinging down on the ladder. His great shoulders looked more than ever\nlike those of the stone Doryphorus, who stands in his perfect, reposeful\nstrength in the Louvre, and had often made her wonder if such men died\nforever with the youth of Greece.\n\n“How sweet the corn smells at night,” said Margaret nervously.\n\n“Yes, like the flowers that grow in paradise, I think.”\n\nShe was somewhat startled by this reply, and more startled when this\ntaciturn man spoke again.\n\n“You go away tomorrow?”\n\n“Yes, we have stayed longer than we thought to now.”\n\n“You not come back any more?”\n\n“No, I expect not. You see, it is a long trip halfway across the\ncontinent.”\n\n“You soon forget about this country, I guess.” It seemed to him now\na little thing to lose his soul for this woman, but that she should\nutterly forget this night into which he threw all his life and all his\neternity, that was a bitter thought.\n\n“No, Eric, I will not forget. You have all been too kind to me for that.\nAnd you won't be sorry you danced this one night, will you?”\n\n“I never be sorry. I have not been so happy before. I not be so happy\nagain, ever. You will be happy many nights yet, I only this one. I will\ndream sometimes, maybe.”\n\nThe mighty resignation of his tone alarmed and touched her. It was as\nwhen some great animal composes itself for death, as when a great ship\ngoes down at sea.\n\nShe sighed, but did not answer him. He drew a little closer and looked\ninto her eyes.\n\n“You are not always happy, too?” he asked.\n\n“No, not always, Eric; not very often, I think.”\n\n“You have a trouble?”\n\n“Yes, but I cannot put it into words. Perhaps if I could do that, I\ncould cure it.”\n\nHe clasped his hands together over his heart, as children do when they\npray, and said falteringly, “If I own all the world, I give him you.”\n\nMargaret felt a sudden moisture in her eyes, and laid her hand on his.\n\n“Thank you, Eric; I believe you would. But perhaps even then I should\nnot be happy. Perhaps I have too much of it already.”\n\nShe did not take her hand away from him; she did not dare. She sat still\nand waited for the traditions in which she had always believed to speak\nand save her. But they were dumb. She belonged to an ultra-refined\ncivilization which tries to cheat nature with elegant sophistries. Cheat\nnature? Bah! One generation may do it, perhaps two, but the third--Can\nwe ever rise above nature or sink below her? Did she not turn on\nJerusalem as upon Sodom, upon St. Anthony in his desert as upon Nero\nin his seraglio? Does she not always cry in brutal triumph: “I am here\nstill, at the bottom of things, warming the roots of life; you cannot\nstarve me nor tame me nor thwart me; I made the world, I rule it, and I\nam its destiny.”\n\nThis woman, on a windmill tower at the world's end with a giant\nbarbarian, heard that cry tonight, and she was afraid! Ah! the terror\nand the delight of that moment when first we fear ourselves! Until then\nwe have not lived.\n\n“Come, Eric, let us go down; the moon is up and the music has begun\nagain,” she said.\n\nHe rose silently and stepped down upon the ladder, putting his arm about\nher to help her. That arm could have thrown Thor's hammer out in the\ncornfields yonder, yet it scarcely touched her, and his hand trembled\nas it had done in the dance. His face was level with hers now and the\nmoonlight fell sharply upon it. All her life she had searched the faces\nof men for the look that lay in his eyes. She knew that that look had\nnever shone for her before, would never shine for her on earth again,\nthat such love comes to one only in dreams or in impossible places like\nthis, unattainable always. This was Love's self, in a moment it would\ndie. Stung by the agonized appeal that emanated from the man's whole\nbeing, she leaned forward and laid her lips on his. Once, twice and\nagain she heard the deep respirations rattle in his throat while\nshe held them there, and the riotous force under her head became\nan engulfing weakness. He drew her up to him until he felt all the\nresistance go out of her body, until every nerve relaxed and yielded.\nWhen she drew her face back from his, it was white with fear.\n\n“Let us go down, oh, my God! let us go down!” she muttered. And the\ndrunken stars up yonder seemed reeling to some appointed doom as she\nclung to the rounds of the ladder. All that she was to know of love she\nhad left upon his lips.\n\n“The devil is loose again,” whispered Olaf Oleson, as he saw Eric\ndancing a moment later, his eyes blazing.\n\nBut Eric was thinking with an almost savage exultation of the time when\nhe should pay for this. Ah, there would be no quailing then! if ever a\nsoul went fearlessly, proudly down to the gates infernal, his should go.\nFor a moment he fancied he was there already, treading down the tempest\nof flame, hugging the fiery hurricane to his breast. He wondered whether\nin ages gone, all the countless years of sinning in which men had sold\nand lost and flung their souls away, any man had ever so cheated Satan,\nhad ever bartered his soul for so great a price.\n\nIt seemed but a little while till dawn.\n\nThe carriage was brought to the door and Wyllis Elliot and his sister\nsaid goodbye. She could not meet Eric's eyes as she gave him her hand,\nbut as he stood by the horse's head, just as the carriage moved off, she\ngave him one swift glance that said, “I will not forget.” In a moment\nthe carriage was gone.\n\nEric changed his coat and plunged his head into the water tank and went\nto the barn to hook up his team. As he led his horses to the door, a\nshadow fell across his path, and he saw Skinner rising in his stirrups.\nHis rugged face was pale and worn with looking after his wayward flock,\nwith dragging men into the way of salvation.\n\n“Good morning, Eric. There was a dance here last night?” he asked,\nsternly.\n\n“A dance? Oh, yes, a dance,” replied Eric, cheerfully.\n\n“Certainly you did not dance, Eric?”\n\n“Yes, I danced. I danced all the time.”\n\nThe minister's shoulders drooped, and an expression of profound\ndiscouragement settled over his haggard face. There was almost anguish\nin the yearning he felt for this soul.\n\n“Eric, I didn't look for this from you. I thought God had set his mark\non you if he ever had on any man. And it is for things like this that\nyou set your soul back a thousand years from God. O foolish and perverse\ngeneration!”\n\nEric drew himself up to his full height and looked off to where the new\nday was gilding the corn-tassels and flooding the uplands with light.\nAs his nostrils drew in the breath of the dew and the morning, something\nfrom the only poetry he had ever read flashed across his mind, and he\nmurmured, half to himself, with dreamy exultation:\n\n“'And a day shall be as a thousand years, and a thousand years as a\nday.'”\n\n\n\n\nThe Enchanted Bluff\n\nWe had our swim before sundown, and while we were cooking our supper the\noblique rays of light made a dazzling glare on the white sand about\nus. The translucent red ball itself sank behind the brown stretches\nof cornfield as we sat down to eat, and the warm layer of air that had\nrested over the water and our clean sand bar grew fresher and smelled of\nthe rank ironweed and sunflowers growing on the flatter shore. The river\nwas brown and sluggish, like any other of the half-dozen streams that\nwater the Nebraska corn lands. On one shore was an irregular line of\nbald clay bluffs where a few scrub oaks with thick trunks and flat,\ntwisted tops threw light shadows on the long grass. The western shore\nwas low and level, with cornfields that stretched to the skyline, and\nall along the water's edge were little sandy coves and beaches where\nslim cottonwoods and willow saplings flickered.\n\nThe turbulence of the river in springtime discouraged milling, and,\nbeyond keeping the old red bridge in repair, the busy farmers did not\nconcern themselves with the stream; so the Sandtown boys were left in\nundisputed possession. In the autumn we hunted quail through the miles\nof stubble and fodder land along the flat shore, and, after the winter\nskating season was over and the ice had gone out, the spring freshets\nand flooded bottoms gave us our great excitement of the year. The\nchannel was never the same for two successive seasons. Every spring the\nswollen stream undermined a bluff to the east, or bit out a few acres of\ncornfield to the west and whirled the soil away, to deposit it in spumy\nmud banks somewhere else. When the water fell low in midsummer, new sand\nbars were thus exposed to dry and whiten in the August sun. Sometimes\nthese were banked so firmly that the fury of the next freshet failed to\nunseat them; the little willow seedlings emerged triumphantly from the\nyellow froth, broke into spring leaf, shot up into summer growth, and\nwith their mesh of roots bound together the moist sand beneath them\nagainst the batterings of another April. Here and there a cottonwood\nsoon glittered among them, quivering in the low current of air that,\neven on breathless days when the dust hung like smoke above the wagon\nroad, trembled along the face of the water.\n\nIt was on such an island, in the third summer of its yellow green, that\nwe built our watch fire; not in the thicket of dancing willow wands, but\non the level terrace of fine sand which had been added that spring;\na little new bit of world, beautifully ridged with ripple marks, and\nstrewn with the tiny skeletons of turtles and fish, all as white and dry\nas if they had been expertly cured. We had been careful not to mar the\nfreshness of the place, although we often swam to it on summer evenings\nand lay on the sand to rest.\n\nThis was our last watch fire of the year, and there were reasons why I\nshould remember it better than any of the others. Next week the other\nboys were to file back to their old places in the Sandtown High School,\nbut I was to go up to the Divide to teach my first country school in the\nNorwegian district. I was already homesick at the thought of quitting\nthe boys with whom I had always played; of leaving the river, and going\nup into a windy plain that was all windmills and cornfields and\nbig pastures; where there was nothing wilful or unmanageable in the\nlandscape, no new islands, and no chance of unfamiliar birds--such as\noften followed the watercourses.\n\nOther boys came and went and used the river for fishing or skating,\nbut we six were sworn to the spirit of the stream, and we were friends\nmainly because of the river. There were the two Hassler boys, Fritz and\nOtto, sons of the little German tailor. They were the youngest of us;\nragged boys of ten and twelve, with sunburned hair, weather-stained\nfaces, and pale blue eyes. Otto, the elder, was the best mathematician\nin school, and clever at his books, but he always dropped out in the\nspring term as if the river could not get on without him. He and Fritz\ncaught the fat, horned catfish and sold them about the town, and they\nlived so much in the water that they were as brown and sandy as the\nriver itself.\n\nThere was Percy Pound, a fat, freckled boy with chubby cheeks, who took\nhalf a dozen boys' story-papers and was always being kept in for reading\ndetective stories behind his desk. There was Tip Smith, destined by\nhis freckles and red hair to be the buffoon in all our games, though he\nwalked like a timid little old man and had a funny, cracked laugh. Tip\nworked hard in his father's grocery store every afternoon, and swept it\nout before school in the morning. Even his recreations were laborious.\nHe collected cigarette cards and tin tobacco-tags indefatigably, and\nwould sit for hours humped up over a snarling little scroll-saw which he\nkept in his attic. His dearest possessions were some little pill bottles\nthat purported to contain grains of wheat from the Holy Land, water from\nthe Jordan and the Dead Sea, and earth from the Mount of Olives. His\nfather had bought these dull things from a Baptist missionary who\npeddled them, and Tip seemed to derive great satisfaction from their\nremote origin.\n\nThe tall boy was Arthur Adams. He had fine hazel eyes that were almost\ntoo reflective and sympathetic for a boy, and such a pleasant voice that\nwe all loved to hear him read aloud. Even when he had to read poetry\naloud at school, no one ever thought of laughing. To be sure, he was\nnot at school very much of the time. He was seventeen and should\nhave finished the High School the year before, but he was always off\nsomewhere with his gun. Arthur's mother was dead, and his father, who\nwas feverishly absorbed in promoting schemes, wanted to send the boy\naway to school and get him off his hands; but Arthur always begged off\nfor another year and promised to study. I remember him as a tall, brown\nboy with an intelligent face, always lounging among a lot of us little\nfellows, laughing at us oftener than with us, but such a soft, satisfied\nlaugh that we felt rather flattered when we provoked it. In after-years\npeople said that Arthur had been given to evil ways as a lad, and it is\ntrue that we often saw him with the gambler's sons and with old Spanish\nFanny's boy, but if he learned anything ugly in their company he never\nbetrayed it to us. We would have followed Arthur anywhere, and I am\nbound to say that he led us into no worse places than the cattail\nmarshes and the stubble fields. These, then, were the boys who camped\nwith me that summer night upon the sand bar.\n\nAfter we finished our supper we beat the willow thicket for driftwood.\nBy the time we had collected enough, night had fallen, and the pungent,\nweedy smell from the shore increased with the coolness. We threw\nourselves down about the fire and made another futile effort to show\nPercy Pound the Little Dipper. We had tried it often before, but he\ncould never be got past the big one.\n\n“You see those three big stars just below the handle, with the bright\none in the middle?” said Otto Hassler; “that's Orion's belt, and the\nbright one is the clasp.” I crawled behind Otto's shoulder and sighted\nup his arm to the star that seemed perched upon the tip of his steady\nforefinger. The Hassler boys did seine-fishing at night, and they knew a\ngood many stars.\n\nPercy gave up the Little Dipper and lay back on the sand, his hands\nclasped under his head. “I can see the North Star,” he announced,\ncontentedly, pointing toward it with his big toe. “Anyone might get lost\nand need to know that.”\n\nWe all looked up at it.\n\n“How do you suppose Columbus felt when his compass didn't point north\nany more?” Tip asked.\n\nOtto shook his head. “My father says that there was another North Star\nonce, and that maybe this one won't last always. I wonder what would\nhappen to us down here if anything went wrong with it?”\n\nArthur chuckled. “I wouldn't worry, Ott. Nothing's apt to happen to it\nin your time. Look at the Milky Way! There must be lots of good dead\nIndians.”\n\nWe lay back and looked, meditating, at the dark cover of the world. The\ngurgle of the water had become heavier. We had often noticed a mutinous,\ncomplaining note in it at night, quite different from its cheerful\ndaytime chuckle, and seeming like the voice of a much deeper and more\npowerful stream. Our water had always these two moods: the one of sunny\ncomplaisance, the other of inconsolable, passionate regret.\n\n“Queer how the stars are all in sort of diagrams,” remarked Otto. “You\ncould do most any proposition in geometry with 'em. They always look\nas if they meant something. Some folks say everybody's fortune is all\nwritten out in the stars, don't they?”\n\n“They believe so in the old country,” Fritz affirmed.\n\nBut Arthur only laughed at him. “You're thinking of Napoleon, Fritzey.\nHe had a star that went out when he began to lose battles. I guess the\nstars don't keep any close tally on Sandtown folks.”\n\nWe were speculating on how many times we could count a hundred before\nthe evening star went down behind the cornfields, when someone cried,\n“There comes the moon, and it's as big as a cart wheel!”\n\nWe all jumped up to greet it as it swam over the bluffs behind us. It\ncame up like a galleon in full sail; an enormous, barbaric thing, red as\nan angry heathen god.\n\n“When the moon came up red like that, the Aztecs used to sacrifice their\nprisoners on the temple top,” Percy announced.\n\n“Go on, Perce. You got that out of _Golden Days_. Do you believe that,\nArthur?” I appealed.\n\nArthur answered, quite seriously: “Like as not. The moon was one of\ntheir gods. When my father was in Mexico City he saw the stone where\nthey used to sacrifice their prisoners.”\n\nAs we dropped down by the fire again some one asked whether the\nMound-Builders were older than the Aztecs. When we once got upon the\nMound-Builders we never willingly got away from them, and we were still\nconjecturing when we heard a loud splash in the water.\n\n“Must have been a big cat jumping,” said Fritz. “They do sometimes. They\nmust see bugs in the dark. Look what a track the moon makes!”\n\nThere was a long, silvery streak on the water, and where the current\nfretted over a big log it boiled up like gold pieces.\n\n“Suppose there ever _was_ any gold hid away in this old river?” Fritz\nasked. He lay like a little brown Indian, close to the fire, his chin on\nhis hand and his bare feet in the air. His brother laughed at him, but\nArthur took his suggestion seriously.\n\n“Some of the Spaniards thought there was gold up here somewhere. Seven\ncities chuck full of gold, they had it, and Coronado and his men came up\nto hunt it. The Spaniards were all over this country once.”\n\nPercy looked interested. “Was that before the Mormons went through?”\n\nWe all laughed at this.\n\n“Long enough before. Before the Pilgrim Fathers, Perce. Maybe they came\nalong this very river. They always followed the watercourses.”\n\n“I wonder where this river really does begin?” Tip mused. That was an\nold and a favorite mystery which the map did not clearly explain. On the\nmap the little black line stopped somewhere in western Kansas; but since\nrivers generally rose in mountains, it was only reasonable to suppose\nthat ours came from the Rockies. Its destination, we knew, was the\nMissouri, and the Hassler boys always maintained that we could embark\nat Sandtown in floodtime, follow our noses, and eventually arrive at\nNew Orleans. Now they took up their old argument. “If us boys had grit\nenough to try it, it wouldn't take no time to get to Kansas City and St.\nJoe.”\n\nWe began to talk about the places we wanted to go to. The Hassler boys\nwanted to see the stockyards in Kansas City, and Percy wanted to see\na big store in Chicago. Arthur was interlocutor and did not betray\nhimself.\n\n“Now it's your turn, Tip.”\n\nTip rolled over on his elbow and poked the fire, and his eyes looked\nshyly out of his queer, tight little face. “My place is awful far away.\nMy Uncle Bill told me about it.”\n\nTip's Uncle Bill was a wanderer, bitten with mining fever, who had\ndrifted into Sandtown with a broken arm, and when it was well had\ndrifted out again.\n\n“Where is it?”\n\n“Aw, it's down in New Mexico somewheres. There aren't no railroads or\nanything. You have to go on mules, and you run out of water before you\nget there and have to drink canned tomatoes.”\n\n“Well, go on, kid. What's it like when you do get there?”\n\nTip sat up and excitedly began his story.\n\n“There's a big red rock there that goes right up out of the sand for\nabout nine hundred feet. The country's flat all around it, and this here\nrock goes up all by itself, like a monument. They call it the Enchanted\nBluff down there, because no white man has ever been on top of it. The\nsides are smooth rock, and straight up, like a wall. The Indians say\nthat hundreds of years ago, before the Spaniards came, there was a\nvillage away up there in the air. The tribe that lived there had some\nsort of steps, made out of wood and bark, bung down over the face of the\nbluff, and the braves went down to hunt and carried water up in big jars\nswung on their backs. They kept a big supply of water and dried meat up\nthere, and never went down except to hunt. They were a peaceful tribe\nthat made cloth and pottery, and they went up there to get out of the\nwars. You see, they could pick off any war party that tried to get up\ntheir little steps. The Indians say they were a handsome people, and\nthey had some sort of queer religion. Uncle Bill thinks they were\nCliff-Dwellers who had got into trouble and left home. They weren't\nfighters, anyhow.\n\n“One time the braves were down hunting and an awful storm came up--a\nkind of waterspout--and when they got back to their rock they found\ntheir little staircase had been all broken to pieces, and only a few\nsteps were left hanging away up in the air. While they were camped at\nthe foot of the rock, wondering what to do, a war party from the north\ncame along and massacred 'em to a man, with all the old folks and women\nlooking on from the rock. Then the war party went on south and left the\nvillage to get down the best way they could. Of course they never got\ndown. They starved to death up there, and when the war party came back\non their way north, they could hear the children crying from the edge\nof the bluff where they had crawled out, but they didn't see a sign of a\ngrown Indian, and nobody has ever been up there since.”\n\nWe exclaimed at this dolorous legend and sat up.\n\n“There couldn't have been many people up there,” Percy demurred. “How\nbig is the top, Tip?”\n\n“Oh, pretty big. Big enough so that the rock doesn't look nearly as tall\nas it is. The top's bigger than the base. The bluff is sort of worn away\nfor several hundred feet up. That's one reason it's so hard to climb.”\n\nI asked how the Indians got up, in the first place.\n\n“Nobody knows how they got up or when. A hunting party came along once\nand saw that there was a town up there, and that was all.”\n\nOtto rubbed his chin and looked thoughtful. “Of course there must be\nsome way to get up there. Couldn't people get a rope over someway and\npull a ladder up?”\n\nTip's little eyes were shining with excitement. “I know a way. Me and\nUncle Bill talked it over. There's a kind of rocket that would take a\nrope over--lifesavers use 'em--and then you could hoist a rope ladder\nand peg it down at the bottom and make it tight with guy ropes on the\nother side. I'm going to climb that there bluff, and I've got it all\nplanned out.”\n\nFritz asked what he expected to find when he got up there.\n\n“Bones, maybe, or the ruins of their town, or pottery, or some of their\nidols. There might be 'most anything up there. Anyhow, I want to see.”\n\n“Sure nobody else has been up there, Tip?” Arthur asked.\n\n“Dead sure. Hardly anybody ever goes down there. Some hunters tried to\ncut steps in the rock once, but they didn't get higher than a man can\nreach. The Bluff's all red granite, and Uncle Bill thinks it's a boulder\nthe glaciers left. It's a queer place, anyhow. Nothing but cactus and\ndesert for hundreds of miles, and yet right under the Bluff there's good\nwater and plenty of grass. That's why the bison used to go down there.”\n\nSuddenly we heard a scream above our fire, and jumped up to see a dark,\nslim bird floating southward far above us--a whooping crane, we knew by\nher cry and her long neck. We ran to the edge of the island, hoping we\nmight see her alight, but she wavered southward along the rivercourse\nuntil we lost her. The Hassler boys declared that by the look of the\nheavens it must be after midnight, so we threw more wood on our fire,\nput on our jackets, and curled down in the warm sand. Several of us\npretended to doze, but I fancy we were really thinking about Tip's Bluff\nand the extinct people. Over in the wood the ring doves were calling\nmournfully to one another, and once we heard a dog bark, far away.\n“Somebody getting into old Tommy's melon patch,” Fritz murmured\nsleepily, but nobody answered him. By and by Percy spoke out of the\nshadows.\n\n“Say, Tip, when you go down there will you take me with you?”\n\n“Maybe.”\n\n“Suppose one of us beats you down there, Tip?”\n\n“Whoever gets to the Bluff first has got to promise to tell the rest of\nus exactly what he finds,” remarked one of the Hassler boys, and to this\nwe all readily assented.\n\nSomewhat reassured, I dropped off to sleep. I must have dreamed about a\nrace for the Bluff, for I awoke in a kind of fear that other people were\ngetting ahead of me and that I was losing my chance. I sat up in my\ndamp clothes and looked at the other boys, who lay tumbled in uneasy\nattitudes about the dead fire. It was still dark, but the sky was blue\nwith the last wonderful azure of night. The stars glistened like crystal\nglobes, and trembled as if they shone through a depth of clear water.\nEven as I watched, they began to pale and the sky brightened. Day came\nsuddenly, almost instantaneously. I turned for another look at the blue\nnight, and it was gone. Everywhere the birds began to call, and all\nmanner of little insects began to chirp and hop about in the willows.\nA breeze sprang up from the west and brought the heavy smell of ripened\ncorn. The boys rolled over and shook themselves. We stripped and plunged\ninto the river just as the sun came up over the windy bluffs.\n\nWhen I came home to Sandtown at Christmas time, we skated out to\nour island and talked over the whole project of the Enchanted Bluff,\nrenewing our resolution to find it.\n\n\nAlthough that was twenty years ago, none of us have ever climbed the\nEnchanted Bluff. Percy Pound is a stockbroker in Kansas City and will go\nnowhere that his red touring car cannot carry him. Otto Hassler went\non the railroad and lost his foot braking; after which he and Fritz\nsucceeded their father as the town tailors.\n\nArthur sat about the sleepy little town all his life--he died before he\nwas twenty-five. The last time I saw him, when I was home on one of my\ncollege vacations, he was sitting in a steamer chair under a cottonwood\ntree in the little yard behind one of the two Sandtown saloons. He was\nvery untidy and his hand was not steady, but when he rose, unabashed,\nto greet me, his eyes were as clear and warm as ever. When I had talked\nwith him for an hour and heard him laugh again, I wondered how it was\nthat when Nature had taken such pains with a man, from his hands to the\narch of his long foot, she had ever lost him in Sandtown. He joked about\nTip Smith's Bluff, and declared he was going down there just as soon\nas the weather got cooler; he thought the Grand Canyon might be worth\nwhile, too.\n\nI was perfectly sure when I left him that he would never get beyond\nthe high plank fence and the comfortable shade of the cottonwood. And,\nindeed, it was under that very tree that he died one summer morning.\n\nTip Smith still talks about going to New Mexico. He married\na slatternly, unthrifty country girl, has been much tied to a\nperambulator, and has grown stooped and grey from irregular meals and\nbroken sleep. But the worst of his difficulties are now over, and he\nhas, as he says, come into easy water. When I was last in Sandtown I\nwalked home with him late one moonlight night, after he had balanced his\ncash and shut up his store. We took the long way around and sat down on\nthe schoolhouse steps, and between us we quite revived the romance of\nthe lone red rock and the extinct people. Tip insists that he still\nmeans to go down there, but he thinks now he will wait until his boy\nBert is old enough to go with him. Bert has been let into the story, and\nthinks of nothing but the Enchanted Bluff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bohemian Girl\n\nThe transcontinental express swung along the windings of the Sand River\nValley, and in the rear seat of the observation car a young man sat\ngreatly at his ease, not in the least discomfited by the fierce sunlight\nwhich beat in upon his brown face and neck and strong back. There was\na look of relaxation and of great passivity about his broad shoulders,\nwhich seemed almost too heavy until he stood up and squared them. He\nwore a pale flannel shirt and a blue silk necktie with loose ends. His\ntrousers were wide and belted at the waist, and his short sack coat hung\nopen. His heavy shoes had seen good service. His reddish-brown hair,\nlike his clothes, had a foreign cut. He had deep-set, dark blue eyes\nunder heavy reddish eyebrows. His face was kept clean only by close\nshaving, and even the sharpest razor left a glint of yellow in the\nsmooth brown of his skin. His teeth and the palms of his hands were very\nwhite. His head, which looked hard and stubborn, lay indolently in the\ngreen cushion of the wicker chair, and as he looked out at the ripe\nsummer country a teasing, not unkindly smile played over his lips.\nOnce, as he basked thus comfortably, a quick light flashed in his eyes,\ncuriously dilating the pupils, and his mouth became a hard, straight\nline, gradually relaxing into its former smile of rather kindly mockery.\nHe told himself, apparently, that there was no point in getting excited;\nand he seemed a master hand at taking his ease when he could. Neither\nthe sharp whistle of the locomotive nor the brakeman's call disturbed\nhim. It was not until after the train had stopped that he rose, put on\na Panama hat, took from the rack a small valise and a flute case, and\nstepped deliberately to the station platform. The baggage was already\nunloaded, and the stranger presented a check for a battered sole-leather\nsteamer trunk.\n\n“Can you keep it here for a day or two?” he asked the agent. “I may send\nfor it, and I may not.”\n\n“Depends on whether you like the country, I suppose?” demanded the agent\nin a challenging tone.\n\n“Just so.”\n\nThe agent shrugged his shoulders, looked scornfully at the small trunk,\nwhich was marked “N.E.,” and handed out a claim check without further\ncomment. The stranger watched him as he caught one end of the trunk and\ndragged it into the express room. The agent's manner seemed to remind\nhim of something amusing. “Doesn't seem to be a very big place,” he\nremarked, looking about.\n\n“It's big enough for us,” snapped the agent, as he banged the trunk into\na corner.\n\nThat remark, apparently, was what Nils Ericson had wanted. He chuckled\nquietly as he took a leather strap from his pocket and swung his valise\naround his shoulder. Then he settled his Panama securely on his head,\nturned up his trousers, tucked the flute case under his arm, and started\noff across the fields. He gave the town, as he would have said, a wide\nberth, and cut through a great fenced pasture, emerging, when he rolled\nunder the barbed wire at the farther corner, upon a white dusty road\nwhich ran straight up from the river valley to the high prairies, where\nthe ripe wheat stood yellow and the tin roofs and weathercocks were\ntwinkling in the fierce sunlight. By the time Nils had done three miles,\nthe sun was sinking and the farm wagons on their way home from town came\nrattling by, covering him with dust and making him sneeze. When one of\nthe farmers pulled up and offered to give him a lift, he clambered in\nwillingly. The driver was a thin, grizzled old man with a long lean\nneck and a foolish sort of beard, like a goat's. “How fur ye goin'?” he\nasked, as he clucked to his horses and started off.\n\n“Do you go by the Ericson place?”\n\n“Which Ericson?” The old man drew in his reins as if he expected to stop\nagain.\n\n“Preacher Ericson's.”\n\n“Oh, the Old Lady Ericson's!” He turned and looked at Nils. “La, me! If\nyou're goin' out there you might a' rid out in the automobile. That's a\npity, now. The Old Lady Ericson was in town with her auto. You might 'a'\nheard it snortin' anywhere about the post-office er the butcher shop.”\n\n“Has she a motor?” asked the stranger absently.\n\n“'Deed an' she has! She runs into town every night about this time for\nher mail and meat for supper. Some folks say she's afraid her auto won't\nget exercise enough, but I say that's jealousy.”\n\n“Aren't there any other motors about here?”\n\n“Oh, yes! we have fourteen in all. But nobody else gets around like\nthe Old Lady Ericson. She's out, rain er shine, over the whole county,\nchargin' into town and out amongst her farms, an' up to her sons'\nplaces. Sure you ain't goin' to the wrong place?” He craned his neck and\nlooked at Nils' flute case with eager curiosity. “The old woman ain't\ngot any piany that I knows on. Olaf, he has a grand. His wife's musical:\ntook lessons in Chicago.”\n\n“I'm going up there tomorrow,” said Nils imperturbably. He saw that the\ndriver took him for a piano tuner.\n\n“Oh, I see!” The old man screwed up his eyes mysteriously. He was a\nlittle dashed by the stranger's noncommunicativeness, but he soon broke\nout again.\n\n“I'm one o' Miss Ericson's tenants. Look after one of her places. I did\nown the place myself once, but I lost it a while back, in the bad years\njust after the World's Fair. Just as well, too, I say. Lets you out o'\npayin' taxes. The Ericsons do own most of the county now. I remember\nthe old preacher's favorite text used to be, 'To them that hath shall be\ngiven.' They've spread something wonderful--run over this here country\nlike bindweed. But I ain't one that begretches it to 'em. Folks is\nentitled to what they kin git; and they're hustlers. Olaf, he's in the\nLegislature now, and a likely man fur Congress. Listen, if that ain't\nthe old woman comin' now. Want I should stop her?”\n\nNils shook his head. He heard the deep chug-chug of a motor vibrating\nsteadily in the clear twilight behind them. The pale lights of the car\nswam over the hill, and the old man slapped his reins and turned clear\nout of the road, ducking his head at the first of three angry snorts\nfrom behind. The motor was running at a hot, even speed, and passed\nwithout turning an inch from its course. The driver was a stalwart woman\nwho sat at ease in the front seat and drove her car bareheaded. She left\na cloud of dust and a trail of gasoline behind her. Her tenant threw\nback his head and sneezed.\n\n“Whew! I sometimes say I'd as lief be _before_ Mrs. Ericson as behind\nher. She does beat all! Nearly seventy, and never lets another soul\ntouch that car. Puts it into commission herself every morning, and keeps\nit tuned up by the hitch-bar all day. I never stop work for a drink\no' water that I don't hear her a-churnin' up the road. I reckon her\ndarter-in-laws never sets down easy nowadays. Never know when she'll pop\nin. Mis' Otto, she says to me: 'We're so afraid that thing'll blow up\nand do Ma some injury yet, she's so turrible venturesome.' Says I: 'I\nwouldn't stew, Mis' Otto; the old lady'll drive that car to the funeral\nof every darter-in-law she's got.' That was after the old woman had\njumped a turrible bad culvert.”\n\nThe stranger heard vaguely what the old man was saying. Just now he was\nexperiencing something very much like homesickness, and he was wondering\nwhat had brought it about. The mention of a name or two, perhaps;\nthe rattle of a wagon along a dusty road; the rank, resinous smell of\nsunflowers and ironweed, which the night damp brought up from the draws\nand low places; perhaps, more than all, the dancing lights of the motor\nthat had plunged by. He squared his shoulders with a comfortable sense\nof strength.\n\nThe wagon, as it jolted westward, climbed a pretty steady up-grade. The\ncountry, receding from the rough river valley, swelled more and more\ngently, as if it had been smoothed out by the wind. On one of the last\nof the rugged ridges, at the end of a branch road, stood a grim square\nhouse with a tin roof and double porches. Behind the house stretched a\nrow of broken, wind-racked poplars, and down the hill slope to the left\nstraggled the sheds and stables. The old man stopped his horses where\nthe Ericsons' road branched across a dry sand creek that wound about the\nfoot of the hill.\n\n“That's the old lady's place. Want I should drive in?” “No, thank you.\nI'll roll out here. Much obliged to you. Good night.”\n\nHis passenger stepped down over the front wheel, and the old man drove\non reluctantly, looking back as if he would like to see how the stranger\nwould be received.\n\nAs Nils was crossing the dry creek he heard the restive tramp of a horse\ncoming toward him down the hill. Instantly he flashed out of the road\nand stood behind a thicket of wild plum bushes that grew in the sandy\nbed. Peering through the dusk, he saw a light horse, under tight\nrein, descending the hill at a sharp walk. The rider was a slender\nwoman--barely visible against the dark hillside--wearing an\nold-fashioned derby hat and a long riding skirt. She sat lightly in the\nsaddle, with her chin high, and seemed to be looking into the distance.\nAs she passed the plum thicket her horse snuffed the air and shied.\nShe struck him, pulling him in sharply, with an angry exclamation,\n_“Blazne!”_ in Bohemian. Once in the main road, she let him out into\na lope, and they soon emerged upon the crest of high land, where they\nmoved along the skyline, silhouetted against the band of faint colour\nthat lingered in the west. This horse and rider, with their free,\nrhythmical gallop, were the only moving things to be seen on the face of\nthe flat country. They seemed, in the last sad light of evening, not to\nbe there accidentally, but as an inevitable detail of the landscape.\n\nNils watched them until they had shrunk to a mere moving speck against\nthe sky, then he crossed the sand creek and climbed the hill. When\nhe reached the gate the front of the house was dark, but a light was\nshining from the side windows. The pigs were squealing in the hog\ncorral, and Nils could see a tall boy, who carried two big wooden\nbuckets, moving about among them. Halfway between the barn and the\nhouse, the windmill wheezed lazily. Following the path that ran around\nto the back porch, Nils stopped to look through the screen door into\nthe lamplit kitchen. The kitchen was the largest room in the house; Nils\nremembered that his older brothers used to give dances there when he was\na boy. Beside the stove stood a little girl with two light yellow braids\nand a broad, flushed face, peering anxiously into a frying pan. In the\ndining-room beyond, a large, broad-shouldered woman was moving about the\ntable. She walked with an active, springy step. Her face was heavy and\nflorid, almost without wrinkles, and her hair was black at seventy.\nNils felt proud of her as he watched her deliberate activity; never a\nmomentary hesitation, or a movement that did not tell. He waited until\nshe came out into the kitchen and, brushing the child aside, took her\nplace at the stove. Then he tapped on the screen door and entered.\n\n“It's nobody but Nils, Mother. I expect you weren't looking for me.”\n\nMrs. Ericson turned away from the stove and stood staring at him. “Bring\nthe lamp, Hilda, and let me look.”\n\nNils laughed and unslung his valise. “What's the matter, Mother? Don't\nyou know me?”\n\nMrs. Ericson put down the lamp. “You must be Nils. You don't look very\ndifferent, anyway.”\n\n“Nor you, Mother. You hold your own. Don't you wear glasses yet?”\n\n“Only to read by. Where's your trunk, Nils?”\n\n“Oh, I left that in town. I thought it might not be convenient for you\nto have company so near threshing-time.”\n\n“Don't be foolish, Nils.” Mrs. Ericson turned back to the stove. “I\ndon't thresh now. I hitched the wheat land onto the next farm and have\na tenant. Hilda, take some hot water up to the company room, and go call\nlittle Eric.”\n\nThe tow-haired child, who had been standing in mute amazement, took up\nthe tea-kettle and withdrew, giving Nils a long, admiring look from the\ndoor of the kitchen stairs.\n\n“Who's the youngster?” Nils asked, dropping down on the bench behind the\nkitchen stove.\n\n“One of your Cousin Henrik's.”\n\n“How long has Cousin Henrik been dead?”\n\n“Six years. There are two boys. One stays with Peter and one with\nAnders. Olaf is their guardeen.”\n\nThere was a clatter of pails on the porch, and a tall, lanky boy peered\nwonderingly in through the screen door. He had a fair, gentle face and\nbig grey eyes, and wisps of soft yellow hair hung down under his cap.\nNils sprang up and pulled him into the kitchen, hugging him and slapping\nhim on the shoulders. “Well, if it isn't my kid! Look at the size of\nhim! Don't you know me, Eric?”\n\nThe boy reddened tinder his sunburn and freckles, and hung his head. “I\nguess it's Nils,” he said shyly.\n\n“You're a good guesser,” laughed Nils giving the lad's hand a swing. To\nhimself he was thinking: “That's why the little girl looked so friendly.\nHe's taught her to like me. He was only six when I went away, and he's\nremembered for twelve years.”\n\nEric stood fumbling with his cap and smiling. “You look just like I\nthought you would,” he ventured.\n\n“Go wash your hands, Eric,” called Mrs. Ericson. “I've got cob corn for\nsupper, Nils. You used to like it. I guess you don't get much of that in\nthe old country. Here's Hilda; she'll take you up to your room. You'll\nwant to get the dust off you before you eat.”\n\nMrs. Ericson went into the dining-room to lay another plate, and the\nlittle girl came up and nodded to Nils as if to let him know that his\nroom was ready. He put out his hand and she took it, with a startled\nglance up at his face. Little Eric dropped his towel, threw an arm about\nNils and one about Hilda, gave them a clumsy squeeze, and then stumbled\nout to the porch.\n\nDuring supper Nils heard exactly how much land each of his eight grown\nbrothers farmed, how their crops were coming on, and how much livestock\nthey were feeding. His mother watched him narrowly as she talked.\n“You've got better looking, Nils,” she remarked abruptly, whereupon he\ngrinned and the children giggled. Eric, although he was eighteen and as\ntall as Nils, was always accounted a child, being the last of so many\nsons. His face seemed childlike, too, Nils thought, and he had the open,\nwandering eyes of a little boy. All the others had been men at his age.\n\nAfter supper Nils went out to the front porch and sat down on the step\nto smoke a pipe. Mrs. Ericson drew a rocking-chair up near him and began\nto knit busily. It was one of the few Old World customs she had kept up,\nfor she could not bear to sit with idle hands.\n\n“Where's little Eric, Mother?”\n\n“He's helping Hilda with the dishes. He does it of his own will; I don't\nlike a boy to be too handy about the house.”\n\n“He seems like a nice kid.”\n\n“He's very obedient.”\n\nNils smiled a little in the dark. It was just as well to shift the line\nof conversation. “What are you knitting there, Mother?”\n\n“Baby stockings. The boys keep me busy.” Mrs. Ericson chuckled and\nclicked her needles.\n\n“How many grandchildren have you?”\n\n“Only thirty-one now. Olaf lost his three. They were sickly, like their\nmother.”\n\n“I supposed he had a second crop by this time!”\n\n“His second wife has no children. She's too proud. She tears about on\nhorseback all the time. But she'll get caught up with, yet. She sets\nherself very high, though nobody knows what for. They were low enough\nBohemians she came of. I never thought much of Bohemians; always\ndrinking.”\n\nNils puffed away at his pipe in silence, and Mrs. Ericson knitted on. In\na few moments she added grimly: “She was down here tonight, just before\nyou came. She'd like to quarrel with me and come between me and Olaf,\nbut I don't give her the chance. I suppose you'll be bringing a wife\nhome some day.”\n\n“I don't know. I've never thought much about it.”\n\n“Well, perhaps it's best as it is,” suggested Mrs. Ericson hopefully.\n“You'd never be contented tied down to the land. There was roving blood\nin your father's family, and it's come out in you. I expect your own\nway of life suits you best.” Mrs. Ericson had dropped into a blandly\nagreeable tone which Nils well remembered. It seemed to amuse him a\ngood deal and his white teeth flashed behind his pipe. His mother's\nstrategies had always diverted him, even when he was a boy--they were so\nflimsy and patent, so illy proportioned to her vigor and force. “They've\nbeen waiting to see which way I'd jump,” he reflected. He felt that Mrs.\nEricson was pondering his case deeply as she sat clicking her needles.\n\n“I don't suppose you've ever got used to steady work,” she went on\npresently. “Men ain't apt to if they roam around too long. It's a pity\nyou didn't come back the year after the World's Fair. Your father picked\nup a good bit of land cheap then, in the hard times, and I expect maybe\nhe'd have give you a farm, it's too bad you put off comin' back so long,\nfor I always thought he meant to do something by you.”\n\nNils laughed and shook the ashes out of his pipe. “I'd have missed a lot\nif I had come back then. But I'm sorry I didn't get back to see father.”\n\n“Well, I suppose we have to miss things at one end or the other. Perhaps\nyou are as well satisfied with your own doings, now, as you'd have been\nwith a farm,” said Mrs. Ericson reassuringly.\n\n“Land's a good thing to have,” Nils commented, as he lit another match\nand sheltered it with his hand.\n\nHis mother looked sharply at his face until the match burned out. “Only\nwhen you stay on it!” she hastened to say.\n\nEric came round the house by the path just then, and Nils rose, with a\nyawn. “Mother, if you don't mind, Eric and I will take a little tramp\nbefore bedtime. It will make me sleep.”\n\n“Very well; only don't stay long. I'll sit up and wait for you. I like\nto lock up myself.”\n\nNils put his hand on Eric's shoulder, and the two tramped down the hill\nand across the sand creek into the dusty highroad beyond. Neither spoke.\nThey swung along at an even gait, Nils puffing at his pipe. There was no\nmoon, and the white road and the wide fields lay faint in the starlight.\nOver everything was darkness and thick silence, and the smell of dust\nand sunflowers. The brothers followed the road for a mile or more\nwithout finding a place to sit down. Finally, Nils perched on a stile\nover the wire fence, and Eric sat on the lower step.\n\n“I began to think you never would come back, Nils,” said the boy softly.\n\n“Didn't I promise you I would?”\n\n“Yes; but people don't bother about promises they make to babies. Did\nyou really know you were going away for good when you went to Chicago\nwith the cattle that time?”\n\n“I thought it very likely, if I could make my way.”\n\n“I don't see how you did it, Nils. Not many fellows could.” Eric rubbed\nhis shoulder against his brother's knee.\n\n“The hard thing was leaving home you and father. It was easy enough,\nonce I got beyond Chicago. Of course I got awful homesick; used to cry\nmyself to sleep. But I'd burned my bridges.”\n\n“You had always wanted to go, hadn't you?”\n\n“Always. Do you still sleep in our little room? Is that cottonwood still\nby the window?”\n\nEric nodded eagerly and smiled up at his brother in the grey darkness.\n\n“You remember how we always said the leaves were whispering when they\nrustled at night? Well, they always whispered to me about the sea.\nSometimes they said names out of the geography books. In a high wind\nthey had a desperate sound, like someone trying to tear loose.”\n\n“How funny, Nils,” said Eric dreamily, resting his chin on his hand.\n“That tree still talks like that, and 'most always it talks to me about\nyou.”\n\nThey sat a while longer, watching the stars. At last Eric whispered\nanxiously: “Hadn't we better go back now? Mother will get tired waiting\nfor us.” They rose and took a short cut home, through the pasture.\n\n\n                           II\n\nThe next morning Nils woke with the first flood of light that came with\ndawn. The white-plastered walls of his room reflected the glare that\nshone through the thin window shades, and he found it impossible to\nsleep. He dressed hurriedly and slipped down the hall and up the back\nstairs to the half-story room which he used to share with his little\nbrother. Eric, in a skimpy nightshirt, was sitting on the edge of the\nbed, rubbing his eyes, his pale yellow hair standing up in tufts all\nover his head. When he saw Nils, he murmured something confusedly and\nhustled his long legs into his trousers. “I didn't expect you'd be up so\nearly, Nils,” he said, as his head emerged from his blue shirt.\n\n“Oh, you thought I was a dude, did you?” Nils gave him a playful tap\nwhich bent the tall boy up like a clasp knife. “See here: I must teach\nyou to box.” Nils thrust his hands into his pockets and walked about.\n“You haven't changed things much up here. Got most of my old traps,\nhaven't you?”\n\nHe took down a bent, withered piece of sapling that hung over the\ndresser. “If this isn't the stick Lou Sandberg killed himself with!”\n\nThe boy looked up from his shoe-lacing.\n\n“Yes; you never used to let me play with that. Just how did he do it,\nNils? You were with father when he found Lou, weren't you?”\n\n“Yes. Father was going off to preach somewhere, and, as we drove along,\nLou's place looked sort of forlorn, and we thought we'd stop and cheer\nhim up. When we found him father said he'd been dead a couple days. He'd\ntied a piece of binding twine round his neck, made a noose in each end,\nfixed the nooses over the ends of a bent stick, and let the stick spring\nstraight; strangled himself.”\n\n“What made him kill himself such a silly way?”\n\nThe simplicity of the boy's question set Nils laughing. He clapped\nlittle Eric on the shoulder. “What made him such a silly as to kill\nhimself at all, I should say!”\n\n“Oh, well! But his hogs had the cholera, and all up and died on him,\ndidn't they?”\n\n“Sure they did; but he didn't have cholera; and there were plenty of\nhogs left in the world, weren't there?”\n\n“Well, but, if they weren't his, how could they do him any good?” Eric\nasked, in astonishment.\n\n“Oh, scat! He could have had lots of fun with other people's hogs. He\nwas a chump, Lou Sandberg. To kill yourself for a pig--think of that,\nnow!” Nils laughed all the way downstairs, and quite embarrassed little\nEric, who fell to scrubbing his face and hands at the tin basin. While\nhe was parting his wet hair at the kitchen looking glass, a heavy tread\nsounded on the stairs. The boy dropped his comb. “Gracious, there's\nMother. We must have talked too long.” He hurried out to the shed,\nslipped on his overalls, and disappeared with the milking pails.\n\nMrs. Ericson came in, wearing a clean white apron, her black hair\nshining from the application of a wet brush.\n\n“Good morning, Mother. Can't I make the fire for you?”\n\n“No, thank you, Nils. It's no trouble to make a cob fire, and I like to\nmanage the kitchen stove myself” Mrs. Ericson paused with a shovel full\nof ashes in her hand. “I expect you will be wanting to see your brothers\nas soon as possible. I'll take you up to Anders' place this morning.\nHe's threshing, and most of our boys are over there.”\n\n“Will Olaf be there?”\n\nMrs. Ericson went on taking out the ashes, and spoke between shovels.\n“No; Olaf's wheat is all in, put away in his new barn. He got six\nthousand bushel this year. He's going to town today to get men to finish\nroofing his barn.”\n\n“So Olaf is building a new barn?” Nils asked absently.\n\n“Biggest one in the county, and almost done. You'll likely be here for\nthe barn-raising. He's going to have a supper and a dance as soon as\neverybody's done threshing. Says it keeps the voters in good humour. I\ntell him that's all nonsense; but Olaf has a head for politics.”\n\n“Does Olaf farm all Cousin Henrik's land?”\n\nMrs. Ericson frowned as she blew into the faint smoke curling up about\nthe cobs. “Yes; he holds it in trust for the children, Hilda and her\nbrothers. He keeps strict account of everything he raises on it, and\nputs the proceeds out at compound interest for them.”\n\nNils smiled as he watched the little flames shoot up. The door of the\nback stairs opened, and Hilda emerged, her arms behind her, buttoning\nup her long gingham apron as she came. He nodded to her gaily, and she\ntwinkled at him out of her little blue eyes, set far apart over her wide\ncheekbones.\n\n“There, Hilda, you grind the coffee--and just put in an extra handful;\nI expect your Cousin Nils likes his strong,” said Mrs. Ericson, as she\nwent out to the shed.\n\nNils turned to look at the little girl, who gripped the coffee grinder\nbetween her knees and ground so hard that her two braids bobbed and her\nface flushed under its broad spattering of freckles. He noticed on her\nmiddle finger something that had not been there last night, and that had\nevidently been put on for company: a tiny gold ring with a clumsily set\ngarnet stone. As her hand went round and round he touched the ring with\nthe tip of his finger, smiling.\n\nHilda glanced toward the shed door through which Mrs. Ericson had\ndisappeared. “My Cousin Clara gave me that,” she whispered bashfully.\n“She's Cousin Olaf's wife.”\n\n\n                           III\n\nMrs. Olaf Ericson--Clara Vavrika, as many people still called her--was\nmoving restlessly about her big bare house that morning. Her husband had\nleft for the county town before his wife was out of bed--her lateness\nin rising was one of the many things the Ericson family had against her.\nClara seldom came downstairs before eight o'clock, and this morning\nshe was even later, for she had dressed with unusual care. She put\non, however, only a tight-fitting black dress, which people thereabouts\nthought very plain. She was a tall, dark woman of thirty, with a rather\nsallow complexion and a touch of dull salmon red in her cheeks, where\nthe blood seemed to burn under her brown skin. Her hair, parted evenly\nabove her low forehead, was so black that there were distinctly blue\nlights in it. Her black eyebrows were delicate half-moons and her lashes\nwere long and heavy. Her eyes slanted a little, as if she had a strain\nof Tartar or gypsy blood, and were sometimes full of fiery determination\nand sometimes dull and opaque. Her expression was never altogether\namiable; was often, indeed, distinctly sullen, or, when she was\nanimated, sarcastic. She was most attractive in profile, for then one\nsaw to advantage her small, well-shaped head and delicate ears, and felt\nat once that here was a very positive, if not an altogether pleasing,\npersonality.\n\nThe entire management of Mrs. Olaf's household devolved upon her aunt,\nJohanna Vavrika, a superstitious, doting woman of fifty. When Clara\nwas a little girl her mother died, and Johanna's life had been spent\nin ungrudging service to her niece. Clara, like many self-willed and\ndiscontented persons, was really very apt, without knowing it, to do\nas other people told her, and to let her destiny be decided for her\nby intelligences much below her own. It was her Aunt Johanna who had\nhumoured and spoiled her in her girlhood, who had got her off to Chicago\nto study piano, and who had finally persuaded her to marry Olaf Ericson\nas the best match she would be likely to make in that part of the\ncountry. Johanna Vavrika had been deeply scarred by smallpox in the old\ncountry. She was short and fat, homely and jolly and sentimental.\nShe was so broad, and took such short steps when she walked, that her\nbrother, Joe Vavrika, always called her his duck. She adored her niece\nbecause of her talent, because of her good looks and masterful ways, but\nmost of all because of her selfishness.\n\nClara's marriage with Olaf Ericson was Johanna's particular triumph. She\nwas inordinately proud of Olaf's position, and she found a sufficiently\nexciting career in managing Clara's house, in keeping it above the\ncriticism of the Ericsons, in pampering Olaf to keep him from finding\nfault with his wife, and in concealing from every one Clara's domestic\ninfelicities. While Clara slept of a morning, Johanna Vavrika was\nbustling about, seeing that Olaf and the men had their breakfast, and\nthat the cleaning or the butter-making or the washing was properly begun\nby the two girls in the kitchen. Then, at about eight o'clock, she would\ntake Clara's coffee up to her, and chat with her while she drank it,\ntelling her what was going on in the house. Old Mrs. Ericson frequently\nsaid that her daughter-in-law would not know what day of the week it\nwas if Johanna did not tell her every morning. Mrs. Ericson despised and\npitied Johanna, but did not wholly dislike her. The one thing she hated\nin her daughter-in-law above everything else was the way in which Clara\ncould come it over people. It enraged her that the affairs of her son's\nbig, barnlike house went on as well as they did, and she used to feel\nthat in this world we have to wait overlong to see the guilty punished.\n“Suppose Johanna Vavrika died or got sick?” the old lady used to say to\nOlaf. “Your wife wouldn't know where to look for her own dish-cloth.”\n Olaf only shrugged his shoulders. The fact remained that Johanna did not\ndie, and, although Mrs. Ericson often told her she was looking poorly,\nshe was never ill. She seldom left the house, and she slept in a little\nroom off the kitchen. No Ericson, by night or day, could come prying\nabout there to find fault without her knowing it. Her one weakness was\nthat she was an incurable talker, and she sometimes made trouble without\nmeaning to.\n\nThis morning Clara was tying a wine-coloured ribbon about her throat\nwhen Johanna appeared with her coffee. After putting the tray on a\nsewing table, she began to make Clara's bed, chattering the while in\nBohemian.\n\n“Well, Olaf got off early, and the girls are baking. I'm going down\npresently to make some poppy-seed bread for Olaf. He asked for prune\npreserves at breakfast, and I told him I was out of them, and to bring\nsome prunes and honey and cloves from town.”\n\nClara poured her coffee. “Ugh! I don't see how men can eat so much sweet\nstuff. In the morning, too!”\n\nHer aunt chuckled knowingly. “Bait a bear with honey, as we say in the\nold country.”\n\n“Was he cross?” her niece asked indifferently.\n\n“Olaf? Oh, no! He was in fine spirits. He's never cross if you know how\nto take him. I never knew a man to make so little fuss about bills. I\ngave him a list of things to get a yard long, and he didn't say a word;\njust folded it up and put it in his pocket.”\n\n“I can well believe he didn't say a word,” Clara remarked with a shrug.\n“Some day he'll forget how to talk.”\n\n“Oh, but they say he's a grand speaker in the Legislature. He knows\nwhen to keep quiet. That's why he's got such influence in politics. The\npeople have confidence in him.” Johanna beat up a pillow and held it\nunder her fat chin while she slipped on the case. Her niece laughed.\n\n“Maybe we could make people believe we were wise, Aunty, if we held our\ntongues. Why did you tell Mrs. Ericson that Norman threw me again last\nSaturday and turned my foot? She's been talking to Olaf.”\n\nJohanna fell into great confusion. “Oh, but, my precious, the old lady\nasked for you, and she's always so angry if I can't give an excuse.\nAnyhow, she needn't talk; she's always tearing up something with that\nmotor of hers.”\n\nWhen her aunt clattered down to the kitchen, Clara went to dust the\nparlour. Since there was not much there to dust, this did not take very\nlong. Olaf had built the house new for her before their marriage, but\nher interest in furnishing it had been short-lived. It went, indeed,\nlittle beyond a bathtub and her piano. They had disagreed about almost\nevery other article of furniture, and Clara had said she would rather\nhave her house empty than full of things she didn't want. The house was\nset in a hillside, and the west windows of the parlour looked out above\nthe kitchen yard thirty feet below. The east windows opened directly\ninto the front yard. At one of the latter, Clara, while she was dusting,\nheard a low whistle. She did not turn at once, but listened intently as\nshe drew her cloth slowly along the round of a chair. Yes, there it was:\n\nI dreamt that I dwelt in ma-a-arble halls.\n\nShe turned and saw Nils Ericson laughing in the sunlight, his hat in his\nhand, just outside the window. As she crossed the room he leaned against\nthe wire screen. “Aren't you at all surprised to see me, Clara Vavrika?”\n\n“No; I was expecting to see you. Mother Ericson telephoned Olaf last\nnight that you were here.”\n\nNils squinted and gave a long whistle. “Telephoned? That must have been\nwhile Eric and I were out walking. Isn't she enterprising? Lift this\nscreen, won't you?”\n\nClara lifted the screen, and Nils swung his leg across the window-sill.\nAs he stepped into the room she said: “You didn't think you were going\nto get ahead of your mother, did you?”\n\nHe threw his hat on the piano. “Oh, I do sometimes. You see, I'm ahead\nof her now. I'm supposed to be in Anders' wheat-field. But, as we were\nleaving, Mother ran her car into a soft place beside the road and sank\nup to the hubs. While they were going for the horses to pull her out,\nI cut away behind the stacks and escaped.” Nils chuckled. Clara's dull\neyes lit up as she looked at him admiringly.\n\n“You've got them guessing already. I don't know what your mother said\nto Olaf over the telephone, but be came back looking as if he'd seen\na ghost, and he didn't go to bed until a dreadful hour--ten o'clock, I\nshould think. He sat out on the porch in the dark like a graven image.\nIt had been one of his talkative days, too.” They both laughed, easily\nand lightly, like people who have laughed a great deal together; but\nthey remained standing.\n\n“Anders and Otto and Peter looked as if they had seen ghosts, too, over\nin the threshing field. What's the matter with them all?”\n\nClara gave him a quick, searching look. “Well, for one thing, they've\nalways been afraid you have the other will.”\n\nNils looked interested. “The other will?”\n\n“Yes. A later one. They knew your father made another, but they never\nknew what he did with it. They almost tore the old house to pieces\nlooking for it. They always suspected that he carried on a clandestine\ncorrespondence with you, for the one thing he would do was to get his\nown mail himself. So they thought he might have sent the new will to\nyou for safekeeping. The old one, leaving everything to your mother, was\nmade long before you went away, and it's understood among them that it\ncuts you out--that she will leave all the property to the others. Your\nfather made the second will to prevent that. I've been hoping you\nhad it. It would be such fun to spring it on them.” Clara laughed\nmirthfully, a thing she did not often do now.\n\nNils shook his head reprovingly. “Come, now, you're malicious.”\n\n“No, I'm not. But I'd like something to happen to stir them all up, just\nfor once. There never was such a family for having nothing ever happen\nto them but dinner and threshing. I'd almost be willing to die, just to\nhave a funeral. _You_ wouldn't stand it for three weeks.”\n\nNils bent over the piano and began pecking at the keys with the finger\nof one hand. “I wouldn't? My dear young lady, how do you know what I can\nstand? _You_ wouldn't wait to find out.”\n\nClara flushed darkly and frowned. “I didn't believe you would ever come\nback--” she said defiantly.\n\n“Eric believed I would, and he was only a baby when I went away.\nHowever, all's well that ends well, and I haven't come back to be a\nskeleton at the feast. We mustn't quarrel. Mother will be here with a\nsearch warrant pretty soon.” He swung round and faced her, thrusting his\nhands into his coat pockets. “Come, you ought to be glad to see me, if\nyou want something to happen. I'm something, even without a will. We can\nhave a little fun, can't we? I think we can!”\n\nShe echoed him, “I think we can!” They both laughed and their eyes\nsparkled. Clara Vavrika looked ten years younger than when she had put\nthe velvet ribbon about her throat that morning.\n\n“You know, I'm so tickled to see mother,” Nils went on. “I didn't know\nI was so proud of her. A regular pile driver. How about little pigtails,\ndown at the house? Is Olaf doing the square thing by those children?”\n\nClara frowned pensively. “Olaf has to do something that looks like the\nsquare thing, now that he's a public man!” She glanced drolly at Nils.\n“But he makes a good commission out of it. On Sundays they all get\ntogether here and figure. He lets Peter and Anders put in big bills for\nthe keep of the two boys, and he pays them out of the estate. They are\nalways having what they call accountings. Olaf gets something out of\nit, too. I don't know just how they do it, but it's entirely a family\nmatter, as they say. And when the Ericsons say that--” Clara lifted her\neyebrows.\n\nJust then the angry _honk-honk_ of an approaching motor sounded from\ndown the road. Their eyes met and they began to laugh. They laughed as\nchildren do when they can not contain themselves, and can not explain\nthe cause of their mirth to grown people, but share it perfectly\ntogether. When Clara Vavrika sat down at the piano after he was gone,\nshe felt that she had laughed away a dozen years. She practised as if\nthe house were burning over her head.\n\nWhen Nils greeted his mother and climbed into the front seat of the\nmotor beside her, Mrs. Ericson looked grim, but she made no comment\nupon his truancy until she had turned her car and was retracing her\nrevolutions along the road that ran by Olaf's big pasture. Then she\nremarked dryly:\n\n“If I were you I wouldn't see too much of Olaf's wife while you are\nhere. She's the kind of woman who can't see much of men without getting\nherself talked about. She was a good deal talked about before he married\nher.”\n\n“Hasn't Olaf tamed her?” Nils asked indifferently.\n\nMrs. Ericson shrugged her massive shoulders. “Olaf don't seem to have\nmuch luck, when it comes to wives. The first one was meek enough, but\nshe was always ailing. And this one has her own way. He says if he\nquarreled with her she'd go back to her father, and then he'd lose the\nBohemian vote. There are a great many Bohunks in this district. But when\nyou find a man under his wife's thumb you can always be sure there's a\nsoft spot in him somewhere.”\n\nNils thought of his own father, and smiled. “She brought him a good deal\nof money, didn't she, besides the Bohemian vote?”\n\nMrs. Ericson sniffed. “Well, she has a fair half section in her own\nname, but I can't see as that does Olaf much good. She will have a good\ndeal of property some day, if old Vavrika don't marry again. But I don't\nconsider a saloonkeeper's money as good as other people's money.”\n\nNils laughed outright. “Come, Mother, don't let your prejudices carry\nyou that far. Money's money. Old Vavrika's a mighty decent sort of\nsaloonkeeper. Nothing rowdy about him.”\n\nMrs. Ericson spoke up angrily. “Oh, I know you always stood up for them!\nBut hanging around there when you were a boy never did you any good,\nNils, nor any of the other boys who went there. There weren't so many\nafter her when she married Olaf, let me tell you. She knew enough to\ngrab her chance.”\n\nNils settled back in his seat. “Of course I liked to go there, Mother,\nand you were always cross about it. You never took the trouble to find\nout that it was the one jolly house in this country for a boy to go to.\nAll the rest of you were working yourselves to death, and the houses\nwere mostly a mess, full of babies and washing and flies. Oh, it was all\nright--I understand that; but you are young only once, and I happened\nto be young then. Now, Vavrika's was always jolly. He played the violin,\nand I used to take my flute, and Clara played the piano, and\nJohanna used to sing Bohemian songs. She always had a big supper for\nus--herrings and pickles and poppy-seed bread, and lots of cake and\npreserves. Old Joe had been in the army in the old country, and he could\ntell lots of good stories. I can see him cutting bread, at the head of\nthe table, now. I don't know what I'd have done when I was a kid if it\nhadn't been for the Vavrikas, really.”\n\n“And all the time he was taking money that other people had worked hard\nin the fields for,” Mrs. Ericson observed.\n\n“So do the circuses, Mother, and they're a good thing. People ought to\nget fun for some of their money. Even father liked old Joe.”\n\n“Your father,” Mrs. Ericson said grimly, “liked everybody.”\n\nAs they crossed the sand creek and turned into her own place, Mrs.\nEricson observed, “There's Olaf's buggy. He's stopped on his way from\ntown.” Nils shook himself and prepared to greet his brother, who was\nwaiting on the porch.\n\nOlaf was a big, heavy Norwegian, slow of speech and movement. His head\nwas large and square, like a block of wood. When Nils, at a distance,\ntried to remember what his brother looked like, he could recall only his\nheavy head, high forehead, large nostrils, and pale blue eyes, set far\napart. Olaf's features were rudimentary: the thing one noticed was the\nface itself, wide and flat and pale; devoid of any expression, betraying\nhis fifty years as little as it betrayed anything else, and powerful by\nreason of its very stolidness. When Olaf shook hands with Nils he looked\nat him from under his light eyebrows, but Nils felt that no one could\never say what that pale look might mean. The one thing he had always\nfelt in Olaf was a heavy stubbornness, like the unyielding stickiness of\nwet loam against the plow. He had always found Olaf the most difficult\nof his brothers.\n\n“How do you do, Nils? Expect to stay with us long?”\n\n“Oh, I may stay forever,” Nils answered gaily. “I like this country\nbetter than I used to.”\n\n“There's been some work put into it since you left,” Olaf remarked.\n\n“Exactly. I think it's about ready to live in now--and I'm about ready\nto settle down.” Nils saw his brother lower his big head (“Exactly like\na bull,” he thought.) “Mother's been persuading me to slow down now, and\ngo in for farming,” he went on lightly.\n\nOlaf made a deep sound in his throat. “Farming ain't learned in a day,”\n he brought out, still looking at the ground.\n\n“Oh, I know! But I pick things up quickly.” Nils had not meant to\nantagonize his brother, and he did not know now why he was doing it. “Of\ncourse,” he went on, “I shouldn't expect to make a big success, as you\nfellows have done. But then, I'm not ambitious. I won't want much. A\nlittle land, and some cattle, maybe.”\n\nOlaf still stared at the ground, his head down. He wanted to ask Nils\nwhat he had been doing all these years, that he didn't have a business\nsomewhere he couldn't afford to leave; why he hadn't more pride than to\ncome back with only a little sole-leather trunk to show for himself, and\nto present himself as the only failure in the family. He did not ask one\nof these questions, but he made them all felt distinctly.\n\n“Humph!” Nils thought. “No wonder the man never talks, when he can butt\nhis ideas into you like that without ever saying a word. I suppose he\nuses that kind of smokeless powder on his wife all the time. But I guess\nshe has her innings.” He chuckled, and Olaf looked up. “Never mind\nme, Olaf. I laugh without knowing why, like little Eric. He's another\ncheerful dog.”\n\n“Eric,” said Olaf slowly, “is a spoiled kid. He's just let his mother's\nbest cow go dry because he don't milk her right. I was hoping you'd take\nhim away somewhere and put him into business. If he don't do any good\namong strangers, he never will.” This was a long speech for Olaf, and as\nhe finished it he climbed into his buggy.\n\nNils shrugged his shoulders. “Same old tricks,” he thought. “Hits from\nbehind you every time. What a whale of a man!” He turned and went round\nto the kitchen, where his mother was scolding little Eric for letting\nthe gasoline get low.\n\n\n                           IV\n\nJoe Vavrika's saloon was not in the county seat, where Olaf and Mrs.\nEricson did their trading, but in a cheerfuller place, a little Bohemian\nsettlement which lay at the other end of the county, ten level miles\nnorth of Olaf's farm. Clara rode up to see her father almost every day.\nVavrika's house was, so to speak, in the back yard of his saloon. The\ngarden between the two buildings was inclosed by a high board fence\nas tight as a partition, and in summer Joe kept beer tables and wooden\nbenches among the gooseberry bushes under his little cherry tree. At\none of these tables Nils Ericson was seated in the late afternoon, three\ndays after his return home. Joe had gone in to serve a customer, and\nNils was lounging on his elbows, looking rather mournfully into his\nhalf-emptied pitcher, when he heard a laugh across the little garden.\nClara, in her riding habit, was standing at the back door of the house,\nunder the grapevine trellis that old Joe had grown there long ago. Nils\nrose.\n\n“Come out and keep your father and me company. We've been gossiping all\nafternoon. Nobody to bother us but the flies.”\n\nShe shook her head. “No, I never come out here any more. Olaf doesn't\nlike it. I must live up to my position, you know.”\n\n“You mean to tell me you never come out and chat with the boys, as you\nused to? He _has_ tamed you! Who keeps up these flower-beds?”\n\n“I come out on Sundays, when father is alone, and read the Bohemian\npapers to him. But I am never here when the bar is open. What have you\ntwo been doing?”\n\n“Talking, as I told you. I've been telling him about my travels. I find\nI can't talk much at home, not even to Eric.”\n\nClara reached up and poked with her riding-whip at a white moth that was\nfluttering in the sunlight among the vine leaves. “I suppose you will\nnever tell me about all those things.”\n\n“Where can I tell them? Not in Olaf's house, certainly. What's the\nmatter with our talking here?” He pointed persuasively with his hat\nto the bushes and the green table, where the flies were singing lazily\nabove the empty beer glasses.\n\nClara shook her head weakly. “No, it wouldn't do. Besides, I am going\nnow.”\n\n“I'm on Eric's mare. Would you be angry if I overtook you?”\n\nClara looked back and laughed. “You might try and see. I can leave you\nif I don't want you. Eric's mare can't keep up with Norman.”\n\nNils went into the bar and attempted to pay his score. Big Joe, six feet\nfour, with curly yellow hair and mustache, clapped him on the shoulder.\n“Not a Goddamn a your money go in my drawer, you hear? Only next time\nyou bring your flute, te-te-te-te-te-ty.” Joe wagged his fingers in\nimitation of the flute player's position.\n\n“My Clara, she come all-a-time Sundays an' play for me. She not like to\nplay at Ericson's place.” He shook his yellow curls and laughed. “Not a\nGoddamn a fun at Ericson's. You come a Sunday. You like-a fun. No forget\nde flute.” Joe talked very rapidly and always tumbled over his English.\nHe seldom spoke it to his customers, and had never learned much.\n\nNils swung himself into the saddle and trotted to the west of the\nvillage, where the houses and gardens scattered into prairie land and\nthe road turned south. Far ahead of him, in the declining light, he saw\nClara Vavrika's slender figure, loitering on horseback. He touched his\nmare with the whip, and shot along the white, level road, under the\nreddening sky. When he overtook Olaf's wife he saw that she had been\ncrying. “What's the matter, Clara Vavrika?” he asked kindly.\n\n“Oh, I get blue sometimes. It was awfully jolly living there with\nfather. I wonder why I ever went away.”\n\nNils spoke in a low, kind tone that he sometimes used with women:\n“That's what I've been wondering these many years. You were the last\ngirl in the country I'd have picked for a wife for Olaf. What made you\ndo it, Clara?”\n\n“I suppose I really did it to oblige the neighbours”--Clara tossed her\nhead. “People were beginning to wonder.”\n\n“To wonder?”\n\n“Yes--why I didn't get married. I suppose I didn't like to keep them in\nsuspense. I've discovered that most girls marry out of consideration for\nthe neighbourhood.”\n\nNils bent his head toward her and his white teeth flashed. “I'd have\ngambled that one girl I knew would say, 'Let the neighbourhood be\ndamned.'”\n\nClara shook her head mournfully. “You see, they have it on you, Nils;\nthat is, if you're a woman. They say you're beginning to go off. That's\nwhat makes us get married: we can't stand the laugh.”\n\nNils looked sidewise at her. He had never seen her head droop before.\nResignation was the last thing he would have expected of her. “In your\ncase, there wasn't something else?”\n\n“Something else?”\n\n“I mean, you didn't do it to spite somebody? Somebody who didn't come\nback?”\n\nClara drew herself up. “Oh, I never thought you'd come back. Not after\nI stopped writing to you, at least. _That_ was all over, long before I\nmarried Olaf.”\n\n“It never occurred to you, then, that the meanest thing you could do to\nme was to marry Olaf?”\n\nClara laughed. “No; I didn't know you were so fond of Olaf.”\n\nNils smoothed his horse's mane with his glove. “You know, Clara Vavrika,\nyou are never going to stick it out. You'll cut away some day, and I've\nbeen thinking you might as well cut away with me.”\n\nClara threw up her chin. “Oh, you don't know me as well as you think. I\nwon't cut away. Sometimes, when I'm with father, I feel like it. But I\ncan hold out as long as the Ericsons can. They've never got the best of\nme yet, and one can live, so long as one isn't beaten. If I go back to\nfather, it's all up with Olaf in politics. He knows that, and he never\ngoes much beyond sulking. I've as much wit as the Ericsons. I'll never\nleave them unless I can show them a thing or two.”\n\n“You mean unless you can come it over them?”\n\n“Yes--unless I go away with a man who is cleverer than they are, and who\nhas more money.”\n\nNils whistled. “Dear me, you are demanding a good deal. The Ericsons,\ntake the lot of them, are a bunch to beat. But I should think the\nexcitement of tormenting them would have worn off by this time.”\n\n“It has, I'm afraid,” Clara admitted mournfully.\n\n“Then why don't you cut away? There are more amusing games than this in\nthe world. When I came home I thought it might amuse me to bully a few\nquarter sections out of the Ericsons; but I've almost decided I can get\nmore fun for my money somewhere else.”\n\nClara took in her breath sharply. “Ah, you have got the other will! That\nwas why you came home!”\n\n“No, it wasn't. I came home to see how you were getting on with Olaf.”\n\nClara struck her horse with the whip, and in a bound she was far ahead\nof him. Nils dropped one word, “Damn!” and whipped after her; but she\nleaned forward in her saddle and fairly cut the wind. Her long riding\nskirt rippled in the still air behind her. The sun was just sinking\nbehind the stubble in a vast, clear sky, and the shadows drew across the\nfields so rapidly that Nils could scarcely keep in sight the dark figure\non the road. When he overtook her he caught her horse by the bridle.\nNorman reared, and Nils was frightened for her; but Clara kept her seat.\n\n“Let me go, Nils Ericson!” she cried. “I hate you more than any of\nthem. You were created to torture me, the whole tribe of you--to make me\nsuffer in every possible way.”\n\nShe struck her horse again and galloped away from him. Nils set his\nteeth and looked thoughtful. He rode slowly home along the deserted\nroad, watching the stars come out in the clear violet sky.\n\nThey flashed softly into the limpid heavens, like jewels let fall into\nclear water. They were a reproach, he felt, to a sordid world. As he\nturned across the sand creek, he looked up at the North Star and smiled,\nas if there were an understanding between them. His mother scolded him\nfor being late for supper.\n\n\n                           V\n\nOn Sunday afternoon Joe Vavrika, in his shirt sleeves and carpet\nslippers, was sitting in his garden, smoking a long-tasseled porcelain\npipe with a hunting scene painted on the bowl. Clara sat under the\ncherry tree, reading aloud to him from the weekly Bohemian papers. She\nhad worn a white muslin dress under her riding habit, and the leaves\nof the cherry tree threw a pattern of sharp shadows over her skirt. The\nblack cat was dozing in the sunlight at her feet, and Joe's dachshund\nwas scratching a hole under the scarlet geraniums and dreaming of\nbadgers. Joe was filling his pipe for the third time since dinner,\nwhen he heard a knocking on the fence. He broke into a loud guffaw and\nunlatched the little door that led into the street. He did not call Nils\nby name, but caught him by the hand and dragged him in. Clara stiffened\nand the colour deepened under her dark skin. Nils, too, felt a little\nawkward. He had not seen her since the night when she rode away from him\nand left him alone on the level road between the fields. Joe dragged him\nto the wooden bench beside the green table.\n\n“You bring de flute,” he cried, tapping the leather case under Nils'\narm. “Ah, das-a good' Now we have some liddle fun like old times. I got\nsomet'ing good for you.” Joe shook his finger at Nils and winked his\nblue eye, a bright clear eye, full of fire, though the tiny bloodvessels\non the ball were always a little distended. “I got somet'ing for you\nfrom”--he paused and waved his hand--“Hongarie. You know Hongarie? You\nwait!” He pushed Nils down on the bench, and went through the back door\nof his saloon.\n\nNils looked at Clara, who sat frigidly with her white skirts drawn\ntight about her. “He didn't tell you he had asked me to come, did he?\nHe wanted a party and proceeded to arrange it. Isn't he fun? Don't be\ncross; let's give him a good time.”\n\nClara smiled and shook out her skirt. “Isn't that like Father? And he\nhas sat here so meekly all day. Well, I won't pout. I'm glad you came.\nHe doesn't have very many good times now any more. There are so few of\nhis kind left. The second generation are a tame lot.”\n\nJoe came back with a flask in one hand and three wine glasses caught by\nthe stems between the fingers of the other. These he placed on the table\nwith an air of ceremony, and, going behind Nils, held the flask between\nhim and the sun, squinting into it admiringly. “You know dis, Tokai? A\ngreat friend of mine, he bring dis to me, a present out of Hongarie. You\nknow how much it cost, dis wine? Chust so much what it weigh in gold.\nNobody but de nobles drink him in Bohemie. Many, many years I save him\nup, dis Tokai.” Joe whipped out his official corkscrew and delicately\nremoved the cork. “De old man die what bring him to me, an' dis wine he\nlay on his belly in my cellar an' sleep. An' now,” carefully pouring\nout the heavy yellow wine, “an' now he wake up; and maybe he wake us\nup, too!” He carried one of the glasses to his daughter and presented it\nwith great gallantry.\n\nClara shook her head, but, seeing her father's disappointment, relented.\n“You taste it first. I don't want so much.”\n\nJoe sampled it with a beatific expression, and turned to Nils. “You\ndrink him slow, dis wine. He very soft, but he go down hot. You see!”\n\nAfter a second glass Nils declared that he couldn't take any more\nwithout getting sleepy. “Now get your fiddle, Vavrika,” he said as he\nopened his flute case.\n\nBut Joe settled back in his wooden rocker and wagged his big carpet\nslipper. “No-no-no-no-no-no-no! No play fiddle now any more: too much\nache in de finger,” waving them, “all-a-time rheumatic. You play de\nflute, te-tety-tetety-te. Bohemie songs.”\n\n“I've forgotten all the Bohemian songs I used to play with you and\nJohanna. But here's one that will make Clara pout. You remember how her\neyes used to snap when we called her the Bohemian Girl?” Nils lifted his\nflute and began “When Other Lips and Other Hearts,” and Joe hummed the\nair in a husky baritone, waving his carpet slipper. “Oh-h-h, das-a fine\nmusic,” he cried, clapping his hands as Nils finished. “Now 'Marble\nHalls, Marble Halls'! Clara, you sing him.”\n\nClara smiled and leaned back in her chair, beginning softly:\n\n       “I dreamt that I dwelt in ma-a-arble halls,\n          With vassals and serfs at my knee,”\n\nand Joe hummed like a big bumblebee.\n\n“There's one more you always played,” Clara said quietly, “I remember\nthat best.” She locked her hands over her knee and began “The Heart\nBowed Down,” and sang it through without groping for the words. She was\nsinging with a good deal of warmth when she came to the end of the old\nsong:\n\n             “For memory is the only friend\n             That grief can call its own.”\n\nJoe flashed out his red silk handkerchief and blew his nose, shaking his\nhead. “No-no-no-no-no-no-no! Too sad, too sad! I not like-a dat. Play\nquick somet'ing gay now.”\n\nNils put his lips to the instrument, and Joe lay back in his chair,\nlaughing and singing, “Oh, Evelina, Sweet Evelina!” Clara laughed, too.\nLong ago, when she and Nils went to high school, the model student of\ntheir class was a very homely girl in thick spectacles. Her name was\nEvelina Oleson; she had a long, swinging walk which somehow suggested\nthe measure of that song, and they used mercilessly to sing it at her.\n\n“Dat ugly Oleson girl, she teach in de school,” Joe gasped, “an' she\nstill walks chust like dat, yup-a, yup-a, yup-a, chust like a\ncamel she go! Now, Nils, we have some more li'l drink. Oh,\nyes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-_yes_! Dis time you haf to drink, and Clara she\nhaf to, so she show she not jealous. So, we all drink to your girl. You\nnot tell her name, eh? No-no-no, I no make you tell. She pretty, eh? She\nmake good sweetheart? I bet!” Joe winked and lifted his glass. “How soon\nyou get married?”\n\nNils screwed up his eyes. “That I don't know. When she says.”\n\nJoe threw out his chest. “Das-a way boys talks. No way for mans. Mans\nsay, 'You come to de church, an' get a hurry on you.' Das-a way mans\ntalks.”\n\n“Maybe Nils hasn't got enough to keep a wife,” put in Clara ironically.\n“How about that, Nils?” she asked him frankly, as if she wanted to know.\n\nNils looked at her coolly, raising one eyebrow. “Oh, I can keep her, all\nright.”\n\n“The way she wants to be kept?”\n\n“With my wife, I'll decide that,” replied Nils calmly. “I'll give her\nwhat's good for her.”\n\nClara made a wry face. “You'll give her the strap, I expect, like old\nPeter Oleson gave his wife.”\n\n“When she needs it,” said Nils lazily, locking his hands behind his head\nand squinting up through the leaves of the cherry tree. “Do you remember\nthe time I squeezed the cherries all over your clean dress, and Aunt\nJohanna boxed my ears for me? My gracious, weren't you mad! You had both\nhands full of cherries, and I squeezed 'em and made the juice fly all\nover you. I liked to have fun with you; you'd get so mad.”\n\n“We _did_ have fun, didn't we? None of the other kids ever had so much\nfun. We knew how to play.”\n\nNils dropped his elbows on the table and looked steadily across at her.\n“I've played with lots of girls since, but I haven't found one who was\nsuch good fun.”\n\nClara laughed. The late afternoon sun was shining full in her face,\nand deep in the back of her eyes there shone something fiery, like the\nyellow drops of Tokai in the brown glass bottle. “Can you still play, or\nare you only pretending?”\n\n“I can play better than I used to, and harder.”\n\n“Don't you ever work, then?” She had not intended to say it. It slipped\nout because she was confused enough to say just the wrong thing.\n\n“I work between times.” Nils' steady gaze still beat upon her. “Don't\nyou worry about my working, Mrs. Ericson. You're getting like all the\nrest of them.” He reached his brown, warm hand across the table and\ndropped it on Clara's, which was cold as an icicle. “Last call for play,\nMrs. Ericson!” Clara shivered, and suddenly her hands and cheeks grew\nwarm. Her fingers lingered in his a moment, and they looked at each\nother earnestly. Joe Vavrika had put the mouth of the bottle to his lips\nand was swallowing the last drops of the Tokai, standing. The sun, just\nabout to sink behind his shop, glistened on the bright glass, on his\nflushed face and curly yellow hair. “Look,” Clara whispered, “that's the\nway I want to grow old.”\n\n\n                           VI\n\nOn the day of Olaf Ericson's barn-raising, his wife, for once in a way,\nrose early. Johanna Vavrika had been baking cakes and frying and boiling\nand spicing meats for a week beforehand, but it was not until the day\nbefore the party was to take place that Clara showed any interest in it.\nThen she was seized with one of her fitful spasms of energy, and took\nthe wagon and little Eric and spent the day on Plum Creek, gathering\nvines and swamp goldenrod to decorate the barn.\n\nBy four o'clock in the afternoon buggies and wagons began to arrive at\nthe big unpainted building in front of Olaf's house. When Nils and his\nmother came at five, there were more than fifty people in the barn, and\na great drove of children. On the ground floor stood six long tables,\nset with the crockery of seven flourishing Ericson families, lent for\nthe occasion. In the middle of each table was a big yellow pumpkin,\nhollowed out and filled with woodbine. In one corner of the barn, behind\na pile of green-and-white striped watermelons, was a circle of chairs\nfor the old people; the younger guests sat on bushel measures or\nbarbed-wire spools, and the children tumbled about in the haymow. The\nbox stalls Clara had converted into booths. The framework was hidden by\ngoldenrod and sheaves of wheat, and the partitions were covered 'With\nwild grapevines full of fruit. At one of these Johanna Vavrika watched\nover her cooked meats, enough to provision an army; and at the next her\nkitchen girls had ranged the ice-cream freezers, and Clara was already\ncutting pies and cakes against the hour of serving. At the third stall,\nlittle Hilda, in a bright pink lawn dress, dispensed lemonade throughout\nthe afternoon. Olaf, as a public man, had thought it inadvisable to\nserve beer in his barn; but Joe Vavrika had come over with two demijohns\nconcealed in his buggy, and after his arrival the wagon shed was much\nfrequented by the men.\n\n“Hasn't Cousin Clara fixed things lovely?” little Hilda whispered, when\nNils went up to her stall and asked for lemonade.\n\nNils leaned against the booth, talking to the excited little girl and\nwatching the people. The barn faced the west, and the sun, pouring in\nat the big doors, filled the whole interior with a golden light,\nthrough which filtered fine particles of dust from the haymow, where the\nchildren were romping. There was a great chattering from the stall where\nJohanna Vavrika exhibited to the admiring women her platters heaped with\nfried chicken, her roasts of beef, boiled tongues, and baked hams\nwith cloves stuck in the crisp brown fat and garnished with tansy and\nparsley. The older women, having assured themselves that there were\ntwenty kinds of cake, not counting cookies, and three dozen fat pies,\nrepaired to the corner behind the pile of watermelons, put on their\nwhite aprons, and fell to their knitting and fancywork. They were a fine\ncompany of old women, and a Dutch painter would have loved to find them\nthere together, where the sun made bright patches on the floor and sent\nlong, quivering shafts of gold through the dusky shade up among the\nrafters. There were fat, rosy old women who looked hot in their best\nblack dresses; spare, alert old women with brown, dark-veined hands; and\nseveral of almost heroic frame, not less massive than old Mrs. Ericson\nherself. Few of them wore glasses, and old Mrs. Svendsen, a Danish\nwoman, who was quite bald, wore the only cap among them. Mrs. Oleson,\nwho had twelve big grandchildren, could still show two braids of yellow\nhair as thick as her own wrists. Among all these grandmothers there were\nmore brown heads than white. They all had a pleased, prosperous air, as\nif they were more than satisfied with themselves and with life. Nils,\nleaning against Hilda's lemonade stand, watched them as they sat\nchattering in four languages, their fingers never lagging behind their\ntongues.\n\n“Look at them over there,” he whispered, detaining Clara as she passed\nhim. “Aren't they the Old Guard? I've just counted thirty hands. I guess\nthey've wrung many a chicken's neck and warmed many a boy's jacket for\nhim in their time.”\n\nIn reality he fell into amazement when he thought of the Herculean\nlabours those fifteen pairs of hands had performed: of the cows they\nhad milked, the butter they had made, the gardens they had planted, the\nchildren and grandchildren they had tended, the brooms they had worn\nout, the mountains of food they had cooked. It made him dizzy. Clara\nVavrika smiled a hard, enigmatical smile at him and walked rapidly away.\nNils' eyes followed her white figure as she went toward the house.\nHe watched her walking alone in the sunlight, looked at her slender,\ndefiant shoulders and her little hard-set head with its coils of\nblue-black hair. “No,” he reflected; “she'd never be like them, not if\nshe lived here a hundred years. She'd only grow more bitter. You can't\ntame a wild thing; you can only chain it. People aren't all alike. I\nmustn't lose my nerve.” He gave Hilda's pigtail a parting tweak and\nset out after Clara. “Where to?” he asked, as he came upon her in the\nkitchen.\n\n“I'm going to the cellar for preserves.”\n\n“Let me go with you. I never get a moment alone with you. Why do you\nkeep out of my way?”\n\nClara laughed. “I don't usually get in anybody's way.”\n\nNils followed her down the stairs and to the far corner of the cellar,\nwhere a basement window let in a stream of light. From a swinging shelf\nClara selected several glass jars, each labeled in Johanna's careful\nhand. Nils took up a brown flask. “What's this? It looks good.”\n\n“It is. It's some French brandy father gave me when I was married. Would\nyou like some? Have you a corkscrew? I'll get glasses.”\n\nWhen she brought them, Nils took them from her and put them down on\nthe window-sill. “Clara Vavrika, do you remember how crazy I used to be\nabout you?”\n\nClara shrugged her shoulders. “Boys are always crazy about somebody or\nanother. I dare say some silly has been crazy about Evelina Oleson. You\ngot over it in a hurry.”\n\n“Because I didn't come back, you mean? I had to get on, you know, and it\nwas hard sledding at first. Then I heard you'd married Olaf.”\n\n“And then you stayed away from a broken heart,” Clara laughed.\n\n“And then I began to think about you more than I had since I first went\naway. I began to wonder if you were really as you had seemed to me when\nI was a boy. I thought I'd like to see. I've had lots of girls, but no\none ever pulled me the same way. The more I thought about you, the\nmore I remembered how it used to be--like hearing a wild tune you\ncan't resist, calling you out at night. It had been a long while since\nanything had pulled me out of my boots, and I wondered whether anything\never could again.” Nils thrust his hands into his coat pockets and\nsquared his shoulders, as his mother sometimes squared hers, as Olaf, in\na clumsier manner, squared his. “So I thought I'd come back and see. Of\ncourse the family have tried to do me, and I rather thought I'd bring\nout father's will and make a fuss. But they can have their old land;\nthey've put enough sweat into it.” He took the flask and filled the\ntwo glasses carefully to the brim. “I've found out what I want from the\nEricsons. Drink _skoal_, Clara.” He lifted his glass, and Clara took\nhers with downcast eyes. “Look at me, Clara Vavrika. _Skoal!_”\n\nShe raised her burning eyes and answered fiercely: “_Skoal!_”\n\n\nThe barn supper began at six o'clock and lasted for two hilarious\nhours. Yense Nelson had made a wager that he could eat two whole fried\nchickens, and he did. Eli Swanson stowed away two whole custard pies,\nand Nick Hermanson ate a chocolate layer cake to the last crumb. There\nwas even a cooky contest among the children, and one thin, slablike\nBohemian boy consumed sixteen and won the prize, a gingerbread pig\nwhich Johanna Vavrika had carefully decorated with red candies and burnt\nsugar. Fritz Sweiheart, the German carpenter, won in the pickle contest,\nbut he disappeared soon after supper and was not seen for the rest of\nthe evening. Joe Vavrika said that Fritz could have managed the pickles\nall right, but he had sampled the demijohn in his buggy too often before\nsitting down to the table.\n\nWhile the supper was being cleared away the two fiddlers began to tune\nup for the dance. Clara was to accompany them on her old upright piano,\nwhich had been brought down from her father's. By this time Nils had\nrenewed old acquaintances. Since his interview with Clara in the cellar,\nhe had been busy telling all the old women how young they looked, and\nall the young ones how pretty they were, and assuring the men that\nthey had here the best farmland in the world. He had made himself so\nagreeable that old Mrs. Ericson's friends began to come up to her and\ntell how lucky she was to get her smart son back again, and please to\nget him to play his flute. Joe Vavrika, who could still play very well\nwhen he forgot that he had rheumatism, caught up a fiddle from Johnny\nOleson and played a crazy Bohemian dance tune that set the wheels going.\nWhen he dropped the bow every one was ready to dance.\n\nOlaf, in a frock coat and a solemn made-up necktie, led the grand march\nwith his mother. Clara had kept well out of _that_ by sticking to the\npiano. She played the march with a pompous solemnity which greatly\namused the prodigal son, who went over and stood behind her.\n\n“Oh, aren't you rubbing it into them, Clara Vavrika? And aren't you\nlucky to have me here, or all your wit would be thrown away.”\n\n“I'm used to being witty for myself. It saves my life.”\n\nThe fiddles struck up a polka, and Nils convulsed Joe Vavrika by leading\nout Evelina Oleson, the homely schoolteacher. His next partner was a\nvery fat Swedish girl, who, although she was an heiress, had not been\nasked for the first dance, but had stood against the wall in her tight,\nhigh-heeled shoes, nervously fingering a lace handkerchief. She was soon\nout of breath, so Nils led her, pleased and panting, to her seat,\nand went over to the piano, from which Clara had been watching his\ngallantry. “Ask Olena Yenson,” she whispered. “She waltzes beautifully.”\n\nOlena, too, was rather inconveniently plump, handsome in a smooth, heavy\nway, with a fine colour and good-natured, sleepy eyes. She was redolent\nof violet sachet powder, and had warm, soft, white hands, but she danced\ndivinely, moving as smoothly as the tide coming in. “There, that's\nsomething like,” Nils said as he released her. “You'll give me the next\nwaltz, won't you? Now I must go and dance with my little cousin.”\n\nHilda was greatly excited when Nils went up to her stall and held out\nhis arm. Her little eyes sparkled, but she declared that she could not\nleave her lemonade. Old Mrs. Ericson, who happened along at this moment,\nsaid she would attend to that, and Hilda came out, as pink as her pink\ndress. The dance was a schottische, and in a moment her yellow braids\nwere fairly standing on end. “Bravo!” Nils cried encouragingly. “Where\ndid you learn to dance so nicely?”\n\n“My Cousin Clara taught me,” the little girl panted.\n\nNils found Eric sitting with a group of boys who were too awkward or too\nshy to dance, and told him that he must dance the next waltz with Hilda.\n\nThe boy screwed up his shoulders. “Aw, Nils, I can't dance. My feet are\ntoo big; I look silly.”\n\n“Don't be thinking about yourself. It doesn't matter how boys look.”\n\nNils had never spoken to him so sharply before, and Eric made haste to\nscramble out of his corner and brush the straw from his coat.\n\nClara nodded approvingly. “Good for you, Nils. I've been trying to\nget hold of him. They dance very nicely together; I sometimes play for\nthem.”\n\n“I'm obliged to you for teaching him. There's no reason why he should\ngrow up to be a lout.”\n\n“He'll never be that. He's more like you than any of them. Only he\nhasn't your courage.” From her slanting eyes Clara shot forth one of\nthose keen glances, admiring and at the same time challenging, which she\nseldom bestowed on any one, and which seemed to say, “Yes, I admire you,\nbut I am your equal.”\n\nClara was proving a much better host than Olaf, who, once the supper was\nover, seemed to feel no interest in anything but the lanterns. He had\nbrought a locomotive headlight from town to light the revels, and he\nkept skulking about as if he feared the mere light from it might set his\nnew barn on fire. His wife, on the contrary, was cordial to every one,\nwas animated and even gay. The deep salmon colour in her cheeks burned\nvividly, and her eyes were full of life. She gave the piano over to the\nfat Swedish heiress, pulled her father away from the corner where he\nsat gossiping with his cronies, and made him dance a Bohemian dance with\nher. In his youth Joe had been a famous dancer, and his daughter got\nhim so limbered up that every one sat around and applauded them. The old\nladies were particularly delighted, and made them go through the dance\nagain. From their corner where they watched and commented, the old women\nkept time with their feet and hands, and whenever the fiddles struck up\na new air old Mrs. Svendsen's white cap would begin to bob.\n\nClara was waltzing with little Eric when Nils came up to them, brushed\nhis brother aside, and swung her out among the dancers. “Remember how\nwe used to waltz on rollers at the old skating rink in town? I suppose\npeople don't do that any more. We used to keep it up for hours. You\nknow, we never did moon around as other boys and girls did. It was dead\nserious with us from the beginning. When we were most in love with each\nother, we used to fight. You were always pinching people; your fingers\nwere like little nippers. A regular snapping turtle, you were. Lord, how\nyou'd like Stockholm! Sit out in the streets in front of cafes and talk\nall night in summer, just like a reception--officers and ladies and\nfunny English people. Jolliest people in the world, the Swedes, once you\nget them going. Always drinking things--champagne and stout mixed,\nhalf-and-half, serve it out of big pitchers, and serve plenty. Slow\npulse, you know; they can stand a lot. Once they light up, they're\nglowworms, I can tell you.”\n\n“All the same, you don't really like gay people.”\n\n“_I_ don't?”\n\n“No; I could tell that when you were looking at the old women there this\nafternoon. They're the kind you really admire, after all; women like\nyour mother. And that's the kind you'll marry.”\n\n“Is it, Miss Wisdom? You'll see who I'll marry, and she won't have a\ndomestic virtue to bless herself with. She'll be a snapping turtle,\nand she'll be a match for me. All the same, they're a fine bunch of old\ndames over there. You admire them yourself.\n\n“No, I don't; I detest them.”\n\n“You won't, when you look back on them from Stockholm or Budapest.\nFreedom settles all that. Oh, but you're the real Bohemian Girl, Clara\nVavrika!” Nils laughed down at her sullen frown and began mockingly to\nsing:\n\n       “Oh, how could a poor gypsy maiden like me\n       Expect the proud bride of a baron to be?”\n\nClara clutched his shoulder. “Hush, Nils; every one is looking at you.”\n\n“I don't care. They can't gossip. It's all in the family, as the\nEricsons say when they divide up little Hilda's patrimony amongst them.\nBesides, we'll give them something to talk about when we hit the\ntrail. Lord, it will be a godsend to them! They haven't had anything so\ninteresting to chatter about since the grasshopper year. It'll give\nthem a new lease of life. And Olaf won't lose the Bohemian vote, either.\nThey'll have the laugh on him so that they'll vote two apiece. They'll\nsend him to Congress. They'll never forget his barn party, or us.\nThey'll always remember us as we're dancing together now. We're making\na legend. Where's my waltz, boys?” he called as they whirled past the\nfiddlers.\n\nThe musicians grinned, looked at each other, hesitated, and began a new\nair; and Nils sang with them, as the couples fell from a quick waltz to\na long, slow glide:\n\n           “When other lips and other hearts\n            Their tale of love shall tell,\n            In language whose excess imparts\n            The power they feel so well.”\n\nThe old women applauded vigorously. “What a gay one he is, that Nils!”\n And old Mrs. Svendsen's cap lurched dreamily from side to side to the\nflowing measure of the dance.\n\n          “Of days that have as ha-a-p-py been,\n          And you'll remember me.”\n\n\n                          VII\n\nThe moonlight flooded that great, silent land. The reaped fields lay\nyellow in it. The straw stacks and poplar windbreaks threw sharp black\nshadows. The roads were white rivers of dust. The sky was a deep,\ncrystalline blue, and the stars were few and faint. Everything seemed to\nhave succumbed, to have sunk to sleep, under the great, golden, tender,\nmidsummer moon. The splendour of it seemed to transcend human life and\nhuman fate. The senses were too feeble to take it in, and every time one\nlooked up at the sky one felt unequal to it, as if one were sitting deaf\nunder the waves of a great river of melody. Near the road, Nils Ericson\nwas lying against a straw stack in Olaf's wheat field. His own life\nseemed strange and unfamiliar to him, as if it were something he had\nread about, or dreamed, and forgotten. He lay very still, watching the\nwhite road that ran in front of him, lost itself among the fields, and\nthen, at a distance, reappeared over a little hill. At last, against\nthis white band he saw something moving rapidly, and he got up and\nwalked to the edge of the field. “She is passing the row of poplars\nnow,” he thought. He heard the padded beat of hoofs along the dusty\nroad, and as she came into sight he stepped out and waved his arms.\nThen, for fear of frightening the horse, he drew back and waited. Clara\nhad seen him, and she came up at a walk. Nils took the horse by the bit\nand stroked his neck.\n\n“What are you doing out so late, Clara Vavrika? I went to the house, but\nJohanna told me you had gone to your father's.”\n\n“Who can stay in the house on a night like this? Aren't you out\nyourself?”\n\n“Ah, but that's another matter.”\n\nNils turned the horse into the field.\n\n“What are you doing? Where are you taking Norman?”\n\n“Not far, but I want to talk to you tonight; I have something to say to\nyou. I can't talk to you at the house, with Olaf sitting there on the\nporch, weighing a thousand tons.”\n\nClara laughed. “He won't be sitting there now. He's in bed by this time,\nand asleep--weighing a thousand tons.”\n\nNils plodded on across the stubble. “Are you really going to spend the\nrest of your life like this, night after night, summer after summer?\nHaven't you anything better to do on a night like this than to wear\nyourself and Norman out tearing across the country to your father's\nand back? Besides, your father won't live forever, you know. His little\nplace will be shut up or sold, and then you'll have nobody but the\nEricsons. You'll have to fasten down the hatches for the winter then.”\n\nClara moved her head restlessly. “Don't talk about that. I try never to\nthink of it. If I lost Father I'd lose everything, even my hold over the\nEricsons.”\n\n“Bah! You'd lose a good deal more than that. You'd lose your race,\neverything that makes you yourself. You've lost a good deal of it now.”\n\n“Of what?”\n\n“Of your love of life, your capacity for delight.”\n\nClara put her hands up to her face. “I haven't, Nils Ericson, I haven't!\nSay anything to me but that. I won't have it!” she declared vehemently.\n\nNils led the horse up to a straw stack, and turned to Clara, looking\nat her intently, as he had looked at her that Sunday afternoon at\nVavrika's. “But why do you fight for that so? What good is the power\nto enjoy, if you never enjoy? Your hands are cold again; what are you\nafraid of all the time? Ah, you're afraid of losing it; that's what's\nthe matter with you! And you will, Clara Vavrika, you will! When I used\nto know you--listen; you've caught a wild bird in your hand, haven't\nyou, and felt its heart beat so hard that you were afraid it would\nshatter its little body to pieces? Well, you used to be just like that,\na slender, eager thing with a wild delight inside you. That is how I\nremembered you. And I come back and find you--a bitter woman. This is\na perfect ferret fight here; you live by biting and being bitten. Can't\nyou remember what life used to be? Can't you remember that old delight?\nI've never forgotten it, or known its like, on land or sea.”\n\nHe drew the horse under the shadow of the straw stack. Clara felt him\ntake her foot out of the stirrup, and she slid softly down into his\narms. He kissed her slowly. He was a deliberate man, but his nerves were\nsteel when he wanted anything. Something flashed out from him like a\nknife out of a sheath. Clara felt everything slipping away from her; she\nwas flooded by the summer night. He thrust his hand into his pocket,\nand then held it out at arm's length. “Look,” he said. The shadow of the\nstraw stack fell sharp across his wrist, and in the palm of his hand she\nsaw a silver dollar shining. “That's my pile,” he muttered; “will you go\nwith me?”\n\nClara nodded, and dropped her forehead on his shoulder.\n\nNils took a deep breath. “Will you go with me tonight?”\n\n“Where?” she whispered softly.\n\n“To town, to catch the midnight flyer.”\n\nClara lifted her head and pulled herself together. “Are you crazy, Nils?\nWe couldn't go away like that.”\n\n“That's the only way we ever will go. You can't sit on the bank and\nthink about it. You have to plunge. That's the way I've always done,\nand it's the right way for people like you and me. There's nothing so\ndangerous as sitting still. You've only got one life, one youth, and\nyou can let it slip through your fingers if you want to; nothing easier.\nMost people do that. You'd be better off tramping the roads with me than\nyou are here.” Nils held back her head and looked into her eyes. “But\nI'm not that kind of a tramp, Clara. You won't have to take in sewing.\nI'm with a Norwegian shipping line; came over on business with the New\nYork offices, but now I'm going straight back to Bergen. I expect\nI've got as much money as the Ericsons. Father sent me a little to get\nstarted. They never knew about that. There, I hadn't meant to tell you;\nI wanted you to come on your own nerve.”\n\nClara looked off across the fields. “It isn't that, Nils, but something\nseems to hold me. I'm afraid to pull against it. It comes out of the\nground, I think.”\n\n“I know all about that. One has to tear loose. You're not needed here.\nYour father will understand; he's made like us. As for Olaf, Johanna\nwill take better care of him than ever you could. It's now or never,\nClara Vavrika. My bag's at the station; I smuggled it there yesterday.”\n\nClara clung to him and hid her face against his shoulder. “Not tonight,”\n she whispered. “Sit here and talk to me tonight. I don't want to go\nanywhere tonight. I may never love you like this again.”\n\nNils laughed through his teeth. “You can't come that on me. That's not\nmy way, Clara Vavrika. Eric's mare is over there behind the stacks, and\nI'm off on the midnight. It's goodbye, or off across the world with me.\nMy carriage won't wait. I've written a letter to Olaf, I'll mail it\nin town. When he reads it he won't bother us--not if I know him. He'd\nrather have the land. Besides, I could demand an investigation of his\nadministration of Cousin Henrik's estate, and that would be bad for a\npublic man. You've no clothes, I know; but you can sit up tonight, and\nwe can get everything on the way. Where's your old dash, Clara Vavrika?\nWhat's become of your Bohemian blood? I used to think you had courage\nenough for anything. Where's your nerve--what are you waiting for?”\n\nClara drew back her head, and he saw the slumberous fire in her eyes.\n“For you to say one thing, Nils Ericson.”\n\n“I never say that thing to any woman, Clara Vavrika.” He leaned back,\nlifted her gently from the ground, and whispered through his teeth: “But\nI'll never, never let you go, not to any man on earth but me! Do you\nunderstand me? Now, wait here.”\n\nClara sank down on a sheaf of wheat and covered her face with her hands.\nShe did not know what she was going to do--whether she would go or stay.\nThe great, silent country seemed to lay a spell upon her. The ground\nseemed to hold her as if by roots. Her knees were soft under her. She\nfelt as if she could not bear separation from her old sorrows, from her\nold discontent. They were dear to her, they had kept her alive, they\nwere a part of her. There would be nothing left of her if she were\nwrenched away from them. Never could she pass beyond that skyline\nagainst which her restlessness had beat so many times. She felt as if\nher soul had built itself a nest there on that horizon at which\nshe looked every morning and every evening, and it was dear to her,\ninexpressibly dear. She pressed her fingers against her eyeballs to shut\nit out. Beside her she heard the tramping of horses in the soft earth.\nNils said nothing to her. He put his hands under her arms and lifted her\nlightly to her saddle. Then he swung himself into his own.\n\n“We shall have to ride fast to catch the midnight train. A last gallop,\nClara Vavrika. Forward!”\n\nThere was a start, a thud of hoofs along the moonlit road, two dark\nshadows going over the hill; and then the great, still land stretched\nuntroubled under the azure night. Two shadows had passed.\n\n\n                          VII\n\nA year after the flight of Olaf Ericson's wife, the night train was\nsteaming across the plains of Iowa. The conductor was hurrying through\none of the day coaches, his lantern on his arm, when a lank, fair-haired\nboy sat up in one of the plush seats and tweaked him by the coat.\n\n“What is the next stop, please, sir?”\n\n“Red Oak, Iowa. But you go through to Chicago, don't you?” He looked\ndown, and noticed that the boy's eyes were red and his face was drawn,\nas if he were in trouble.\n\n“Yes. But I was wondering whether I could get off at the next place and\nget a train back to Omaha.”\n\n“Well, I suppose you could. Live in Omaha?”\n\n“No. In the western part of the State. How soon do we get to Red Oak?”\n\n“Forty minutes. You'd better make up your mind, so I can tell the\nbaggageman to put your trunk off.”\n\n“Oh, never mind about that! I mean, I haven't got any,” the boy added,\nblushing.\n\n“Run away,” the conductor thought, as he slammed the coach door behind\nhim.\n\nEric Ericson crumpled down in his seat and put his brown hand to his\nforehead. He had been crying, and he had had no supper, and his head was\naching violently. “Oh, what shall I do?” he thought, as he looked dully\ndown at his big shoes. “Nils will be ashamed of me; I haven't got any\nspunk.”\n\nEver since Nils had run away with his brother's wife, life at home had\nbeen hard for little Eric. His mother and Olaf both suspected him of\ncomplicity. Mrs. Ericson was harsh and faultfinding, constantly wounding\nthe boy's pride; and Olaf was always setting her against him.\n\nJoe Vavrika heard often from his daughter. Clara had always been fond of\nher father, and happiness made her kinder. She wrote him long accounts\nof the voyage to Bergen, and of the trip she and Nils took through\nBohemia to the little town where her father had grown up and where she\nherself was born. She visited all her kinsmen there, and sent her father\nnews of his brother, who was a priest; of his sister, who had married a\nhorse-breeder--of their big farm and their many children. These letters\nJoe always managed to read to little Eric. They contained messages for\nEric and Hilda. Clara sent presents, too, which Eric never dared to take\nhome and which poor little Hilda never even saw, though she loved to\nhear Eric tell about them when they were out getting the eggs together.\nBut Olaf once saw Eric coming out of Vavrika's house--the old man had\nnever asked the boy to come into his saloon--and Olaf went straight to\nhis mother and told her. That night Mrs. Ericson came to Eric's room\nafter he was in bed and made a terrible scene. She could be very\nterrifying when she was really angry. She forbade him ever to speak to\nVavrika again, and after that night she would not allow him to go to\ntown alone. So it was a long while before Eric got any more news of his\nbrother. But old Joe suspected what was going on, and he carried Clara's\nletters about in his pocket. One Sunday he drove out to see a German\nfriend of his, and chanced to catch sight of Eric, sitting by the cattle\npond in the big pasture. They went together into Fritz Oberlies' barn,\nand read the letters and talked things over. Eric admitted that things\nwere getting hard for him at home. That very night old Joe sat down and\nlaboriously penned a statement of the case to his daughter.\n\nThings got no better for Eric. His mother and Olaf felt that, however\nclosely he was watched, he still, as they said, “heard.” Mrs. Ericson\ncould not admit neutrality. She had sent Johanna Vavrika packing back to\nher brother's, though Olaf would much rather have kept her than Anders'\neldest daughter, whom Mrs. Ericson installed in her place. He was not\nso highhanded as his mother, and he once sulkily told her that she might\nbetter have taught her granddaughter to cook before she sent Johanna\naway. Olaf could have borne a good deal for the sake of prunes spiced in\nhoney, the secret of which Johanna had taken away with her.\n\nAt last two letters came to Joe Vavrika: one from Nils, enclosing a\npostal order for money to pay Eric's passage to Bergen, and one from\nClara, saying that Nils had a place for Eric in the offices of his\ncompany, that he was to live with them, and that they were only waiting\nfor him to come. He was to leave New York on one of the boats of Nils'\nown line; the captain was one of their friends, and Eric was to make\nhimself known at once.\n\nNils' directions were so explicit that a baby could have followed them,\nEric felt. And here he was, nearing Red Oak, Iowa, and rocking backward\nand forward in despair. Never had he loved his brother so much, and\nnever had the big world called to him so hard. But there was a lump in\nhis throat which would not go down. Ever since nightfall he had been\ntormented by the thought of his mother, alone in that big house that\nhad sent forth so many men. Her unkindness now seemed so little, and her\nloneliness so great. He remembered everything she had ever done for him:\nhow frightened she had been when he tore his hand in the corn-sheller,\nand how she wouldn't let Olaf scold him. When Nils went away he didn't\nleave his mother all alone, or he would never have gone. Eric felt sure\nof that.\n\nThe train whistled. The conductor came in, smiling not unkindly.\n“Well, young man, what are you going to do? We stop at Red Oak in three\nminutes.”\n\n“Yes, thank you. I'll let you know.” The conductor went out, and the boy\ndoubled up with misery. He couldn't let his one chance go like this.\nHe felt for his breast pocket and crackled Nils' letter to give him\ncourage. He didn't want Nils to be ashamed of him. The train stopped.\nSuddenly he remembered his brother's kind, twinkling eyes, that always\nlooked at you as if from far away. The lump in his throat softened. “Ah,\nbut Nils, Nils would _understand_!” he thought. “That's just it about\nNils; he always understands.”\n\nA lank, pale boy with a canvas telescope stumbled off the train to the\nRed Oak siding, just as the conductor called, “All aboard!”\n\nThe next night Mrs. Ericson was sitting alone in her wooden\nrocking-chair on the front porch. Little Hilda had been sent to bed and\nhad cried herself to sleep. The old woman's knitting was on her lap, but\nher hands lay motionless on top of it. For more than an hour she had not\nmoved a muscle. She simply sat, as only the Ericsons and the mountains\ncan sit. The house was dark, and there was no sound but the croaking of\nthe frogs down in the pond of the little pasture.\n\nEric did not come home by the road, but across the fields, where no one\ncould see him. He set his telescope down softly in the kitchen shed, and\nslipped noiselessly along the path to the front porch. He sat down on\nthe step without saying anything. Mrs. Ericson made no sign, and the\nfrogs croaked on. At last the boy spoke timidly.\n\n“I've come back, Mother.”\n\n“Very well,” said Mrs. Ericson.\n\nEric leaned over and picked up a little stick out of the grass.\n\n“How about the milking?” he faltered.\n\n“That's been done, hours ago.”\n\n“Who did you get?”\n\n“Get? I did it myself. I can milk as good as any of you.”\n\nEric slid along the step nearer to her. “Oh, Mother, why did you?” he\nasked sorrowfully. “Why didn't you get one of Otto's boys?”\n\n“I didn't want anybody to know I was in need of a boy,” said Mrs.\nEricson bitterly. She looked straight in front of her and her mouth\ntightened. “I always meant to give you the home farm,” she added.\n\nThe boy stared and slid closer. “Oh, Mother,” he faltered, “I don't care\nabout the farm. I came back because I thought you might be needing me,\nmaybe.” He hung his head and got no further.\n\n“Very well,” said Mrs. Ericson. Her hand went out from her suddenly\nand rested on his head. Her fingers twined themselves in his soft, pale\nhair. His tears splashed down on the boards; happiness filled his heart.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TROLL GARDEN\n\n\n\n\nFlavia and Her Artists\n\nAs the train neared Tarrytown, Imogen Willard began to wonder why she\nhad consented to be one of Flavia's house party at all. She had not felt\nenthusiastic about it since leaving the city, and was experiencing a\nprolonged ebb of purpose, a current of chilling indecision, under\nwhich she vainly sought for the motive which had induced her to accept\nFlavia's invitation.\n\nPerhaps it was a vague curiosity to see Flavia's husband, who had been\nthe magician of her childhood and the hero of innumerable Arabian fairy\ntales. Perhaps it was a desire to see M. Roux, whom Flavia had announced\nas the especial attraction of the occasion. Perhaps it was a wish to\nstudy that remarkable woman in her own setting.\n\nImogen admitted a mild curiosity concerning Flavia. She was in the habit\nof taking people rather seriously, but somehow found it impossible to\ntake Flavia so, because of the very vehemence and insistence with which\nFlavia demanded it. Submerged in her studies, Imogen had, of late years,\nseen very little of Flavia; but Flavia, in her hurried visits to New\nYork, between her excursions from studio to studio--her luncheons with\nthis lady who had to play at a matinee, and her dinners with that singer\nwho had an evening concert--had seen enough of her friend's handsome\ndaughter to conceive for her an inclination of such violence and\nassurance as only Flavia could afford. The fact that Imogen had shown\nrather marked capacity in certain esoteric lines of scholarship, and\nhad decided to specialize in a well-sounding branch of philology at\nthe Ecole des Chartes, had fairly placed her in that category of\n“interesting people” whom Flavia considered her natural affinities, and\nlawful prey.\n\nWhen Imogen stepped upon the station platform she was immediately\nappropriated by her hostess, whose commanding figure and assurance of\nattire she had recognized from a distance. She was hurried into a high\ntilbury and Flavia, taking the driver's cushion beside her, gathered up\nthe reins with an experienced hand.\n\n“My dear girl,” she remarked, as she turned the horses up the street, “I\nwas afraid the train might be late. M. Roux insisted upon coming up by\nboat and did not arrive until after seven.”\n\n“To think of M. Roux's being in this part of the world at all, and\nsubject to the vicissitudes of river boats! Why in the world did he come\nover?” queried Imogen with lively interest. “He is the sort of man who\nmust dissolve and become a shadow outside of Paris.”\n\n“Oh, we have a houseful of the most interesting people,” said Flavia,\nprofessionally. “We have actually managed to get Ivan Schemetzkin. He\nwas ill in California at the close of his concert tour, you know, and he\nis recuperating with us, after his wearing journey from the coast. Then\nthere is Jules Martel, the painter; Signor Donati, the tenor; Professor\nSchotte, who has dug up Assyria, you know; Restzhoff, the Russian\nchemist; Alcee Buisson, the philologist; Frank Wellington, the novelist;\nand Will Maidenwood, the editor of _Woman_. Then there is my second\ncousin, Jemima Broadwood, who made such a hit in Pinero's comedy last\nwinter, and Frau Lichtenfeld. _Have_ you read her?”\n\nImogen confessed her utter ignorance of Frau Lichtenfeld, and Flavia\nwent on.\n\n“Well, she is a most remarkable person; one of those advanced German\nwomen, a militant iconoclast, and this drive will not be long enough to\npermit of my telling you her history. Such a story! Her novels were the\ntalk of all Germany when I was there last, and several of them have been\nsuppressed--an honor in Germany, I understand. 'At Whose Door' has been\ntranslated. I am so unfortunate as not to read German.”\n\n“I'm all excitement at the prospect of meeting Miss Broadwood,”\n said Imogen. “I've seen her in nearly everything she does. Her stage\npersonality is delightful. She always reminds me of a nice, clean,\npink-and-white boy who has just had his cold bath, and come down all\naglow for a run before breakfast.”\n\n“Yes, but isn't it unfortunate that she will limit herself to those\nminor comedy parts that are so little appreciated in this country? One\nought to be satisfied with nothing less than the best, ought one?” The\npeculiar, breathy tone in which Flavia always uttered that word “best,”\n the most worn in her vocabulary, always jarred on Imogen and always made\nher obdurate.\n\n“I don't at all agree with you,” she said reservedly. “I thought\neveryone admitted that the most remarkable thing about Miss Broadwood is\nher admirable sense of fitness, which is rare enough in her profession.”\n\nFlavia could not endure being contradicted; she always seemed to regard\nit in the light of a defeat, and usually colored unbecomingly. Now she\nchanged the subject.\n\n“Look, my dear,” she cried, “there is Frau Lichtenfeld now, coming to\nmeet us. Doesn't she look as if she had just escaped out of Valhalla?\nShe is actually over six feet.”\n\nImogen saw a woman of immense stature, in a very short skirt and a\nbroad, flapping sun hat, striding down the hillside at a long, swinging\ngait. The refugee from Valhalla approached, panting. Her heavy, Teutonic\nfeatures were scarlet from the rigor of her exercise, and her hair,\nunder her flapping sun hat, was tightly befrizzled about her brow. She\nfixed her sharp little eyes upon Imogen and extended both her hands.\n\n“So this is the little friend?” she cried, in a rolling baritone.\n\nImogen was quite as tall as her hostess; but everything, she reflected,\nis comparative. After the introduction Flavia apologized.\n\n“I wish I could ask you to drive up with us, Frau Lichtenfeld.”\n\n“Ah, no!” cried the giantess, drooping her head in humorous caricature\nof a time-honored pose of the heroines of sentimental romances. “It has\nnever been my fate to be fitted into corners. I have never known the\nsweet privileges of the tiny.”\n\nLaughing, Flavia started the ponies, and the colossal woman, standing\nin the middle of the dusty road, took off her wide hat and waved them\na farewell which, in scope of gesture, recalled the salute of a plumed\ncavalier.\n\nWhen they arrived at the house, Imogen looked about her with keen\ncuriosity, for this was veritably the work of Flavia's hands, the\nmaterialization of hopes long deferred. They passed directly into a\nlarge, square hall with a gallery on three sides, studio fashion. This\nopened at one end into a Dutch breakfast room, beyond which was the\nlarge dining room. At the other end of the hall was the music room.\nThere was a smoking room, which one entered through the library\nbehind the staircase. On the second floor there was the same general\narrangement: a square hall, and, opening from it, the guest chambers,\nor, as Miss Broadwood termed them, the “cages.”\n\nWhen Imogen went to her room, the guests had begun to return from their\nvarious afternoon excursions. Boys were gliding through the halls with\nice water, covered trays, and flowers, colliding with maids and valets\nwho carried shoes and other articles of wearing apparel. Yet, all this\nwas done in response to inaudible bells, on felt soles, and in hushed\nvoices, so that there was very little confusion about it.\n\nFlavia had at last built her house and hewn out her seven pillars; there\ncould be no doubt, now, that the asylum for talent, the sanatorium of\nthe arts, so long projected, was an accomplished fact. Her ambition\nhad long ago outgrown the dimensions of her house on Prairie Avenue;\nbesides, she had bitterly complained that in Chicago traditions were\nagainst her. Her project had been delayed by Arthur's doggedly standing\nout for the Michigan woods, but Flavia knew well enough that certain of\nthe _rarae aves_--“the best”--could not be lured so far away from the\nseaport, so she declared herself for the historic Hudson and knew no\nretreat. The establishing of a New York office had at length overthrown\nArthur's last valid objection to quitting the lake country for three\nmonths of the year; and Arthur could be wearied into anything, as those\nwho knew him knew.\n\nFlavia's house was the mirror of her exultation; it was a temple to the\ngods of Victory, a sort of triumphal arch. In her earlier days she had\nswallowed experiences that would have unmanned one of less torrential\nenthusiasm or blind pertinacity. But, of late years, her determination\nhad told; she saw less and less of those mysterious persons with\nmysterious obstacles in their path and mysterious grievances against the\nworld, who had once frequented her house on Prairie Avenue. In the stead\nof this multitude of the unarrived, she had now the few, the select,\n“the best.” Of all that band of indigent retainers who had once fed at\nher board like the suitors in the halls of Penelope, only Alcee Buisson\nstill retained his right of entree. He alone had remembered that\nambition hath a knapsack at his back, wherein he puts alms to oblivion,\nand he alone had been considerate enough to do what Flavia had expected\nof him, and give his name a current value in the world. Then, as\nMiss Broadwood put it, “he was her first real one,”--and Flavia, like\nMohammed, could remember her first believer.\n\n“The House of Song,” as Miss Broadwood had called it, was the outcome\nof Flavia's more exalted strategies. A woman who made less a point of\nsympathizing with their delicate organisms, might have sought to plunge\nthese phosphorescent pieces into the tepid bath of domestic life;\nbut Flavia's discernment was deeper. This must be a refuge where the\nshrinking soul, the sensitive brain, should be unconstrained; where\nthe caprice of fancy should outweigh the civil code, if necessary. She\nconsidered that this much Arthur owed her; for she, in her turn, had\nmade concessions. Flavia had, indeed, quite an equipment of epigrams\nto the effect that our century creates the iron genii which evolve its\nfairy tales: but the fact that her husband's name was annually painted\nupon some ten thousand threshing machines in reality contributed very\nlittle to her happiness.\n\nArthur Hamilton was born and had spent his boyhood in the West Indies,\nand physically he had never lost the brand of the tropics. His father,\nafter inventing the machine which bore his name, had returned to the\nStates to patent and manufacture it. After leaving college, Arthur had\nspent five years ranching in the West and traveling abroad. Upon his\nfather's death he had returned to Chicago and, to the astonishment of\nall his friends, had taken up the business--without any demonstration\nof enthusiasm, but with quiet perseverance, marked ability, and amazing\nindustry. Why or how a self-sufficient, rather ascetic man of thirty,\nindifferent in manner, wholly negative in all other personal relations,\nshould have doggedly wooed and finally married Flavia Malcolm was a\nproblem that had vexed older heads than Imogen's.\n\nWhile Imogen was dressing she heard a knock at her door, and a young\nwoman entered whom she at once recognized as Jemima Broadwood--“Jimmy”\n Broadwood she was called by people in her own profession. While there\nwas something unmistakably professional in her frank _savoir-faire_,\n“Jimmy's” was one of those faces to which the rouge never seems to\nstick. Her eyes were keen and gray as a windy April sky, and so far from\nhaving been seared by calcium lights, you might have fancied they had\nnever looked on anything less bucolic than growing fields and country\nfairs. She wore her thick, brown hair short and parted at the side; and,\nrather than hinting at freakishness, this seemed admirably in keeping\nwith her fresh, boyish countenance. She extended to Imogen a large,\nwell-shaped hand which it was a pleasure to clasp.\n\n“Ah! You are Miss Willard, and I see I need not introduce myself. Flavia\nsaid you were kind enough to express a wish to meet me, and I preferred\nto meet you alone. Do you mind if I smoke?”\n\n“Why, certainly not,” said Imogen, somewhat disconcerted and looking\nhurriedly about for matches.\n\n“There, be calm, I'm always prepared,” said Miss Broadwood, checking\nImogen's flurry with a soothing gesture, and producing an oddly\nfashioned silver match-case from some mysterious recess in her dinner\ngown. She sat down in a deep chair, crossed her patent-leather Oxfords,\nand lit her cigarette. “This matchbox,” she went on meditatively, “once\nbelonged to a Prussian officer. He shot himself in his bathtub, and I\nbought it at the sale of his effects.”\n\nImogen had not yet found any suitable reply to make to this rather\nirrelevant confidence, when Miss Broadwood turned to her cordially: “I'm\nawfully glad you've come, Miss Willard, though I've not quite decided\nwhy you did it. I wanted very much to meet you. Flavia gave me your\nthesis to read.”\n\n“Why, how funny!” ejaculated Imogen.\n\n“On the contrary,” remarked Miss Broadwood. “I thought it decidedly\nlacked humor.”\n\n“I meant,” stammered Imogen, beginning to feel very much like Alice\nin Wonderland, “I meant that I thought it rather strange Mrs. Hamilton\nshould fancy you would be interested.”\n\nMiss Broadwood laughed heartily. “Now, don't let my rudeness frighten\nyou. Really, I found it very interesting, and no end impressive. You\nsee, most people in my profession are good for absolutely nothing else,\nand, therefore, they have a deep and abiding conviction that in some\nother line they might have shone. Strange to say, scholarship is the\nobject of our envious and particular admiration. Anything in type\nimpresses us greatly; that's why so many of us marry authors or\nnewspapermen and lead miserable lives.” Miss Broadwood saw that she had\nrather disconcerted Imogen, and blithely tacked in another direction.\n“You see,” she went on, tossing aside her half-consumed cigarette, “some\nyears ago Flavia would not have deemed me worthy to open the pages of\nyour thesis--nor to be one of her house party of the chosen, for that\nmatter. I've Pinero to thank for both pleasures. It all depends on the\nclass of business I'm playing whether I'm in favor or not. Flavia is\nmy second cousin, you know, so I can say whatever disagreeable things I\nchoose with perfect good grace. I'm quite desperate for someone to laugh\nwith, so I'm going to fasten myself upon you--for, of course, one can't\nexpect any of these gypsy-dago people to see anything funny. I don't\nintend you shall lose the humor of the situation. What do you think of\nFlavia's infirmary for the arts, anyway?”\n\n“Well, it's rather too soon for me to have any opinion at all,” said\nImogen, as she again turned to her dressing. “So far, you are the only\none of the artists I've met.”\n\n“One of them?” echoed Miss Broadwood. “One of the _artists_? My offense\nmay be rank, my dear, but I really don't deserve that. Come, now,\nwhatever badges of my tribe I may bear upon me, just let me divest you\nof any notion that I take myself seriously.”\n\nImogen turned from the mirror in blank astonishment and sat down on the\narm of a chair, facing her visitor. “I can't fathom you at all,\nMiss Broadwood,” she said frankly. “Why shouldn't you take yourself\nseriously? What's the use of beating about the bush? Surely you know\nthat you are one of the few players on this side of the water who have\nat all the spirit of natural or ingenuous comedy?”\n\n“Thank you, my dear. Now we are quite even about the thesis, aren't\nwe? Oh, did you mean it? Well, you _are_ a clever girl. But you see it\ndoesn't do to permit oneself to look at it in that light. If we do, we\nalways go to pieces and waste our substance astarring as the unhappy\ndaughter of the Capulets. But there, I hear Flavia coming to take you\ndown; and just remember I'm not one of them--the artists, I mean.”\n\n\nFlavia conducted Imogen and Miss Broadwood downstairs. As they reached\nthe lower hall they heard voices from the music room, and dim figures\nwere lurking in the shadows under the gallery, but their hostess led\nstraight to the smoking room. The June evening was chilly, and a fire\nhad been lighted in the fireplace. Through the deepening dusk, the\nfirelight flickered upon the pipes and curious weapons on the wall and\nthrew an orange glow over the Turkish hangings. One side of the smoking\nroom was entirely of glass, separating it from the conservatory, which\nwas flooded with white light from the electric bulbs. There was about\nthe darkened room some suggestion of certain chambers in the Arabian\nNights, opening on a court of palms. Perhaps it was partially this\nmemory-evoking suggestion that caused Imogen to start so violently when\nshe saw dimly, in a blur of shadow, the figure of a man, who sat smoking\nin a low, deep chair before the fire. He was long, and thin, and brown.\nHis long, nerveless hands drooped from the arms of his chair. A brown\nmustache shaded his mouth, and his eyes were sleepy and apathetic. When\nImogen entered he rose indolently and gave her his hand, his manner\nbarely courteous.\n\n“I am glad you arrived promptly, Miss Willard,” he said with an\nindifferent drawl. “Flavia was afraid you might be late. You had a\npleasant ride up, I hope?”\n\n“Oh, very, thank you, Mr. Hamilton,” she replied, feeling that he did\nnot particularly care whether she replied at all.\n\nFlavia explained that she had not yet had time to dress for dinner,\nas she had been attending to Mr. Will Maidenwood, who had become faint\nafter hurting his finger in an obdurate window, and immediately excused\nherself As she left, Hamilton turned to Miss Broadwood with a rather\nspiritless smile.\n\n“Well, Jimmy,” he remarked, “I brought up a piano box full of fireworks\nfor the boys. How do you suppose we'll manage to keep them until the\nFourth?”\n\n“We can't, unless we steel ourselves to deny there are any on the\npremises,” said Miss Broadwood, seating herself on a low stool by\nHamilton's chair and leaning back against the mantel. “Have you seen\nHelen, and has she told you the tragedy of the tooth?”\n\n“She met me at the station, with her tooth wrapped up in tissue paper.\nI had tea with her an hour ago. Better sit down, Miss Willard;” he rose\nand pushed a chair toward Imogen, who was standing peering into the\nconservatory. “We are scheduled to dine at seven, but they seldom get\naround before eight.”\n\nBy this time Imogen had made out that here the plural pronoun, third\nperson, always referred to the artists. As Hamilton's manner did not\nspur one to cordial intercourse, and as his attention seemed directed\nto Miss Broadwood, insofar as it could be said to be directed to anyone,\nshe sat down facing the conservatory and watched him, unable to decide\nin how far he was identical with the man who had first met Flavia\nMalcolm in her mother's house, twelve years ago. Did he at all remember\nhaving known her as a little girl, and why did his indifference hurt her\nso, after all these years? Had some remnant of her childish affection\nfor him gone on living, somewhere down in the sealed caves of her\nconsciousness, and had she really expected to find it possible to be\nfond of him again? Suddenly she saw a light in the man's sleepy eyes,\nan unmistakable expression of interest and pleasure that fairly startled\nher. She turned quickly in the direction of his glance, and saw Flavia,\njust entering, dressed for dinner and lit by the effulgence of her most\nradiant manner. Most people considered Flavia handsome, and there was\nno gainsaying that she carried her five-and-thirty years splendidly. Her\nfigure had never grown matronly, and her face was of the sort that does\nnot show wear. Its blond tints were as fresh and enduring as enamel--and\nquite as hard. Its usual expression was one of tense, often strained,\nanimation, which compressed her lips nervously. A perfect scream of\nanimation, Miss Broadwood had called it, created and maintained by\nsheer, indomitable force of will. Flavia's appearance on any scene\nwhatever made a ripple, caused a certain agitation and recognition, and,\namong impressionable people, a certain uneasiness, For all her sparkling\nassurance of manner, Flavia was certainly always ill at ease and, even\nmore certainly, anxious. She seemed not convinced of the established\norder of material things, seemed always trying to conceal her feeling\nthat walls might crumble, chasms open, or the fabric of her life fly\nto the winds in irretrievable entanglement. At least this was the\nimpression Imogen got from that note in Flavia which was so manifestly\nfalse.\n\nHamilton's keen, quick, satisfied glance at his wife had recalled to\nImogen all her inventory of speculations about them. She looked at him\nwith compassionate surprise. As a child she had never permitted herself\nto believe that Hamilton cared at all for the woman who had taken him\naway from her; and since she had begun to think about them again, it\nhad never occurred to her that anyone could become attached to Flavia in\nthat deeply personal and exclusive sense. It seemed quite as irrational\nas trying to possess oneself of Broadway at noon.\n\nWhen they went out to dinner Imogen realized the completeness of\nFlavia's triumph. They were people of one name, mostly, like kings;\npeople whose names stirred the imagination like a romance or a melody.\nWith the notable exception of M. Roux, Imogen had seen most of them\nbefore, either in concert halls or lecture rooms; but they looked\nnoticeably older and dimmer than she remembered them.\n\nOpposite her sat Schemetzkin, the Russian pianist, a short, corpulent\nman, with an apoplectic face and purplish skin, his thick, iron-gray\nhair tossed back from his forehead. Next to the German giantess sat the\nItalian tenor--the tiniest of men--pale, with soft, light hair, much\nin disorder, very red lips, and fingers yellowed by cigarettes. Frau\nLichtenfeld shone in a gown of emerald green, fitting so closely as to\nenhance her natural floridness. However, to do the good lady justice,\nlet her attire be never so modest, it gave an effect of barbaric\nsplendor. At her left sat Herr Schotte, the Assyriologist, whose\nfeatures were effectually concealed by the convergence of his hair and\nbeard, and whose glasses were continually falling into his plate.\nThis gentleman had removed more tons of earth in the course of his\nexplorations than had any of his confreres, and his vigorous attack upon\nhis food seemed to suggest the strenuous nature of his accustomed toil.\nHis eyes were small and deeply set, and his forehead bulged fiercely\nabove his eyes in a bony ridge. His heavy brows completed the leonine\nsuggestion of his face. Even to Imogen, who knew something of his work\nand greatly respected it, he was entirely too reminiscent of the Stone\nAge to be altogether an agreeable dinner companion. He seemed, indeed,\nto have absorbed something of the savagery of those early types of life\nwhich he continually studied.\n\nFrank Wellington, the young Kansas man who had been two years out of\nHarvard and had published three historical novels, sat next to Mr. Will\nMaidenwood, who was still pale from his recent sufferings and carried\nhis hand bandaged. They took little part in the general conversation,\nbut, like the lion and the unicorn, were always at it, discussing,\nevery time they met, whether there were or were not passages in Mr.\nWellington's works which should be eliminated, out of consideration\nfor the Young Person. Wellington had fallen into the hands of a great\nAmerican syndicate which most effectually befriended struggling authors\nwhose struggles were in the right direction, and which had guaranteed\nto make him famous before he was thirty. Feeling the security of his\nposition he stoutly defended those passages which jarred upon the\nsensitive nerves of the young editor of _Woman_. Maidenwood, in the\nsmoothest of voices, urged the necessity of the author's recognizing\ncertain restrictions at the outset, and Miss Broadwood, who joined the\nargument quite without invitation or encouragement, seconded him with\npointed and malicious remarks which caused the young editor manifest\ndiscomfort. Restzhoff, the chemist, demanded the attention of the entire\ncompany for his exposition of his devices for manufacturing ice cream\nfrom vegetable oils and for administering drugs in bonbons.\n\nFlavia, always noticeably restless at dinner, was somewhat apathetic\ntoward the advocate of peptonized chocolate and was plainly concerned\nabout the sudden departure of M. Roux, who had announced that it would\nbe necessary for him to leave tomorrow. M. Emile Roux, who sat at\nFlavia's right, was a man in middle life and quite bald, clearly without\npersonal vanity, though his publishers preferred to circulate only those\nof his portraits taken in his ambrosial youth. Imogen was considerably\nshocked at his unlikeness to the slender, black-stocked Rolla he had\nlooked at twenty. He had declined into the florid, settled heaviness of\nindifference and approaching age. There was, however, a certain look of\ndurability and solidity about him; the look of a man who has earned the\nright to be fat and bald, and even silent at dinner if he chooses.\n\nThroughout the discussion between Wellington and Will Maidenwood, though\nthey invited his participation, he remained silent, betraying no sign\neither of interest or contempt. Since his arrival he had directed most\nof his conversation to Hamilton, who had never read one of his twelve\ngreat novels. This perplexed and troubled Flavia. On the night of his\narrival Jules Martel had enthusiastically declared, “There are schools\nand schools, manners and manners; but Roux is Roux, and Paris sets\nits watches by his clock.” Flavia had already repeated this remark to\nImogen. It haunted her, and each time she quoted it she was impressed\nanew.\n\nFlavia shifted the conversation uneasily, evidently exasperated and\nexcited by her repeated failures to draw the novelist out. “Monsieur\nRoux,” she began abruptly, with her most animated smile, “I remember so\nwell a statement I read some years ago in your 'Mes Etudes des Femmes'\nto the effect that you had never met a really intellectual woman. May I\nask, without being impertinent, whether that assertion still represents\nyour experience?”\n\n“I meant, madam,” said the novelist conservatively, “intellectual in\na sense very special, as we say of men in whom the purely intellectual\nfunctions seem almost independent.”\n\n“And you still think a woman so constituted a mythical personage?”\n persisted Flavia, nodding her head encouragingly.\n\n“_Une Meduse_, madam, who, if she were discovered, would transmute us\nall into stone,” said the novelist, bowing gravely. “If she existed at\nall,” he added deliberately, “it was my business to find her, and\nshe has cost me many a vain pilgrimage. Like Rudel of Tripoli, I have\ncrossed seas and penetrated deserts to seek her out. I have, indeed,\nencountered women of learning whose industry I have been compelled\nto respect; many who have possessed beauty and charm and perplexing\ncleverness; a few with remarkable information and a sort of fatal\nfacility.”\n\n“And Mrs. Browning, George Eliot, and your own Mme. Dudevant?” queried\nFlavia with that fervid enthusiasm with which she could, on occasion,\nutter things simply incomprehensible for their banality--at her feats of\nthis sort Miss Broadwood was wont to sit breathless with admiration.\n\n“Madam, while the intellect was undeniably present in the performances\nof those women, it was only the stick of the rocket. Although this\nwoman has eluded me I have studied her conditions and perturbances as\nastronomers conjecture the orbits of planets they have never seen.\nif she exists, she is probably neither an artist nor a woman with a\nmission, but an obscure personage, with imperative intellectual needs,\nwho absorbs rather than produces.”\n\nFlavia, still nodding nervously, fixed a strained glance of\ninterrogation upon M. Roux. “Then you think she would be a woman whose\nfirst necessity would be to know, whose instincts would be satisfied\nonly with the best, who could draw from others; appreciative, merely?”\n\nThe novelist lifted his dull eyes to his interlocutress with an\nuntranslatable smile and a slight inclination of his shoulders. “Exactly\nso; you are really remarkable, madam,” he added, in a tone of cold\nastonishment.\n\nAfter dinner the guests took their coffee in the music room, where\nSchemetzkin sat down at the piano to drum ragtime, and give his\ncelebrated imitation of the boardingschool girl's execution of Chopin.\nHe flatly refused to play anything more serious, and would practice only\nin the morning, when he had the music room to himself. Hamilton and M.\nRoux repaired to the smoking room to discuss the necessity of extending\nthe tax on manufactured articles in France--one of those conversations\nwhich particularly exasperated Flavia.\n\nAfter Schemetzkin had grimaced and tortured the keyboard with malicious\nvulgarities for half an hour, Signor Donati, to put an end to his\ntorture, consented to sing, and Flavia and Imogen went to fetch Arthur\nto play his accompaniments. Hamilton rose with an annoyed look and\nplaced his cigarette on the mantel. “Why yes, Flavia, I'll accompany\nhim, provided he sings something with a melody, Italian arias or\nballads, and provided the recital is not interminable.”\n\n“You will join us, M. Roux?”\n\n“Thank you, but I have some letters to write,” replied the novelist,\nbowing.\n\nAs Flavia had remarked to Imogen, “Arthur really played accompaniments\nremarkably well.” To hear him recalled vividly the days of her\nchildhood, when he always used to spend his business vacations at her\nmother's home in Maine. He had possessed for her that almost hypnotic\ninfluence which young men sometimes exert upon little girls. It was a\nsort of phantom love affair, subjective and fanciful, a precocity of\ninstinct, like that tender and maternal concern which some little girls\nfeel for their dolls. Yet this childish infatuation is capable of\nall the depressions and exaltations of love itself, it has its bitter\njealousies, cruel disappointments, its exacting caprices.\n\nSummer after summer she had awaited his coming and wept at his\ndeparture, indifferent to the gayer young men who had called her their\nsweetheart and laughed at everything she said. Although Hamilton never\nsaid so, she had been always quite sure that he was fond of her. When\nhe pulled her up the river to hunt for fairy knolls shut about by low,\nhanging willows, he was often silent for an hour at a time, yet she\nnever felt he was bored or was neglecting her. He would lie in the sand\nsmoking, his eyes half-closed, watching her play, and she was always\nconscious that she was entertaining him. Sometimes he would take a copy\nof “Alice in Wonderland” in his pocket, and no one could read it as he\ncould, laughing at her with his dark eyes, when anything amused him.\nNo one else could laugh so, with just their eyes, and without moving a\nmuscle of their face. Though he usually smiled at passages that seemed\nnot at all funny to the child, she always laughed gleefully, because he\nwas so seldom moved to mirth that any such demonstration delighted her\nand she took the credit of it entirely to herself Her own inclination\nhad been for serious stories, with sad endings, like the Little Mermaid,\nwhich he had once told her in an unguarded moment when she had a cold,\nand was put to bed early on her birthday night and cried because she\ncould not have her party. But he highly disapproved of this preference,\nand had called it a morbid taste, and always shook his finger at her\nwhen she asked for the story. When she had been particularly good, or\nparticularly neglected by other people, then he would sometimes melt\nand tell her the story, and never laugh at her if she enjoyed the “sad\nending” even to tears. When Flavia had taken him away and he came no\nmore, she wept inconsolably for the space of two weeks, and refused\nto learn her lessons. Then she found the story of the Little Mermaid\nherself, and forgot him.\n\nImogen had discovered at dinner that he could still smile at one\nsecretly, out of his eyes, and that he had the old manner of outwardly\nseeming bored, but letting you know that he was not. She was intensely\ncurious about his exact state of feeling toward his wife, and more\ncurious still to catch a sense of his final adjustment to the conditions\nof life in general. This, she could not help feeling, she might get\nagain--if she could have him alone for an hour, in some place where\nthere was a little river and a sandy cove bordered by drooping willows,\nand a blue sky seen through white sycamore boughs.\n\nThat evening, before retiring, Flavia entered her husband's room, where\nhe sat in his smoking jacket, in one of his favorite low chairs.\n\n“I suppose it's a grave responsibility to bring an ardent, serious young\nthing like Imogen here among all these fascinating personages,” she\nremarked reflectively. “But, after all, one can never tell. These grave,\nsilent girls have their own charm, even for facile people.”\n\n“Oh, so that is your plan?” queried her husband dryly. “I was wondering\nwhy you got her up here. She doesn't seem to mix well with the faciles.\nAt least, so it struck me.”\n\nFlavia paid no heed to this jeering remark, but repeated, “No, after\nall, it may not be a bad thing.”\n\n“Then do consign her to that shaken reed, the tenor,” said her husband\nyawning. “I remember she used to have a taste for the pathetic.”\n\n“And then,” remarked Flavia coquettishly, “after all, I owe her mother a\nreturn in kind. She was not afraid to trifle with destiny.”\n\nBut Hamilton was asleep in his chair.\n\n\nNext morning Imogen found only Miss Broadwood in the breakfast room.\n\n“Good morning, my dear girl, whatever are you doing up so early? They\nnever breakfast before eleven. Most of them take their coffee in their\nroom. Take this place by me.”\n\nMiss Broadwood looked particularly fresh and encouraging in her blue\nserge walking skirt, her open jacket displaying an expanse of stiff,\nwhite shirt bosom, dotted with some almost imperceptible figure, and\na dark blue-and-white necktie, neatly knotted under her wide, rolling\ncollar. She wore a white rosebud in the lapel of her coat, and decidedly\nshe seemed more than ever like a nice, clean boy on his holiday. Imogen\nwas just hoping that they would breakfast alone when Miss Broadwood\nexclaimed, “Ah, there comes Arthur with the children. That's the reward\nof early rising in this house; you never get to see the youngsters at\nany other time.”\n\nHamilton entered, followed by two dark, handsome little boys. The girl,\nwho was very tiny, blonde like her mother, and exceedingly frail, he\ncarried in his arms. The boys came up and said good morning with an ease\nand cheerfulness uncommon, even in well-bred children, but the little\ngirl hid her face on her father's shoulder.\n\n“She's a shy little lady,” he explained as he put her gently down in her\nchair. “I'm afraid she's like her father; she can't seem to get used to\nmeeting people. And you, Miss Willard, did you dream of the White Rabbit\nor the Little Mermaid?”\n\n“Oh, I dreamed of them all! All the personages of that buried\ncivilization,” cried Imogen, delighted that his estranged manner of the\nnight before had entirely vanished and feeling that, somehow, the old\nconfidential relations had been restored during the night.\n\n“Come, William,” said Miss Broadwood, turning to the younger of the two\nboys, “and what did you dream about?”\n\n“We dreamed,” said William gravely--he was the more assertive of the two\nand always spoke for both--“we dreamed that there were fireworks hidden\nin the basement of the carriage house; lots and lots of fireworks.”\n\nHis elder brother looked up at him with apprehensive astonishment, while\nMiss Broadwood hastily put her napkin to her lips and Hamilton dropped\nhis eyes. “If little boys dream things, they are so apt not to come\ntrue,” he reflected sadly. This shook even the redoubtable William, and\nhe glanced nervously at his brother. “But do things vanish just because\nthey have been dreamed?” he objected.\n\n“Generally that is the very best reason for their vanishing,” said\nArthur gravely.\n\n“But, Father, people can't help what they dream,” remonstrated Edward\ngently.\n\n“Oh, come! You're making these children talk like a Maeterlinck\ndialogue,” laughed Miss Broadwood.\n\nFlavia presently entered, a book in her hand, and bade them all good\nmorning. “Come, little people, which story shall it be this morning?”\n she asked winningly. Greatly excited, the children followed her into\nthe garden. “She does then, sometimes,” murmured Imogen as they left the\nbreakfast room.\n\n“Oh, yes, to be sure,” said Miss Broadwood cheerfully. “She reads a\nstory to them every morning in the most picturesque part of the garden.\nThe mother of the Gracchi, you know. She does so long, she says, for the\ntime when they will be intellectual companions for her. What do you say\nto a walk over the hills?”\n\nAs they left the house they met Frau Lichtenfeld and the bushy\nHerr Schotte--the professor cut an astonishing figure in golf\nstockings--returning from a walk and engaged in an animated conversation\non the tendencies of German fiction.\n\n“Aren't they the most attractive little children,” exclaimed Imogen as\nthey wound down the road toward the river.\n\n“Yes, and you must not fail to tell Flavia that you think so. She will\nlook at you in a sort of startled way and say, 'Yes, aren't they?' and\nmaybe she will go off and hunt them up and have tea with them, to fully\nappreciate them. She is awfully afraid of missing anything good, is\nFlavia. The way those youngsters manage to conceal their guilty presence\nin the House of Song is a wonder.”\n\n“But don't any of the artist-folk fancy children?” asked Imogen.\n\n“Yes, they just fancy them and no more. The chemist remarked the other\nday that children are like certain salts which need not be actualized\nbecause the formulae are quite sufficient for practical purposes. I\ndon't see how even Flavia can endure to have that man about.”\n\n“I have always been rather curious to know what Arthur thinks of it\nall,” remarked Imogen cautiously.\n\n“Thinks of it!” ejaculated Miss Broadwood. “Why, my dear, what would any\nman think of having his house turned into an hotel, habited by freaks\nwho discharge his servants, borrow his money, and insult his neighbors?\nThis place is shunned like a lazaretto!”\n\n“Well, then, why does he--why does he--” persisted Imogen.\n\n“Bah!” interrupted Miss Broadwood impatiently, “why did he in the first\nplace? That's the question.”\n\n“Marry her, you mean?” said Imogen coloring.\n\n“Exactly so,” said Miss Broadwood sharply, as she snapped the lid of her\nmatchbox.\n\n“I suppose that is a question rather beyond us, and certainly one which\nwe cannot discuss,” said Imogen. “But his toleration on this one point\npuzzles me, quite apart from other complications.”\n\n“Toleration? Why this point, as you call it, simply is Flavia. Who could\nconceive of her without it? I don't know where it's all going to end,\nI'm sure, and I'm equally sure that, if it were not for Arthur,\nI shouldn't care,” declared Miss Broadwood, drawing her shoulders\ntogether.\n\n“But will it end at all, now?”\n\n“Such an absurd state of things can't go on indefinitely. A man isn't\ngoing to see his wife make a guy of herself forever, is he? Chaos\nhas already begun in the servants' quarters. There are six different\nlanguages spoken there now. You see, it's all on an entirely false\nbasis. Flavia hasn't the slightest notion of what these people are\nreally like, their good and their bad alike escape her. They, on the\nother hand, can't imagine what she is driving at. Now, Arthur is worse\noff than either faction; he is not in the fairy story in that he sees\nthese people exactly as they are, _but_ he is utterly unable to see\nFlavia as they see her. There you have the situation. Why can't he see\nher as we do? My dear, that has kept me awake o' nights. This man who\nhas thought so much and lived so much, who is naturally a critic, really\ntakes Flavia at very nearly her own estimate. But now I am entering upon\na wilderness. From a brief acquaintance with her you can know nothing of\nthe icy fastnesses of Flavia's self-esteem. It's like St. Peter's; you\ncan't realize its magnitude at once. You have to grow into a sense of\nit by living under its shadow. It has perplexed even Emile Roux, that\nmerciless dissector of egoism. She has puzzled him the more because he\nsaw at a glance what some of them do not perceive at once, and what will\nbe mercifully concealed from Arthur until the trump sounds; namely, that\nall Flavia's artists have done or ever will do means exactly as much to\nher as a symphony means to an oyster; that there is no bridge by which\nthe significance of any work of art could be conveyed to her.”\n\n“Then, in the name of goodness, why does she bother?” gasped Imogen.\n“She is pretty, wealthy, well-established; why should she bother?”\n\n“That's what M. Roux has kept asking himself. I can't pretend to analyze\nit. She reads papers on the Literary Landmarks of Paris, the Loves of\nthe Poets, and that sort of thing, to clubs out in Chicago. To Flavia\nit is more necessary to be called clever than to breathe. I would give a\ngood deal to know that glum Frenchman's diagnosis. He has been\nwatching her out of those fishy eyes of his as a biologist watches a\nhemisphereless frog.”\n\nFor several days after M. Roux's departure Flavia gave an embarrassing\nshare of her attention to Imogen. Embarrassing, because Imogen had the\nfeeling of being energetically and futilely explored, she knew not for\nwhat. She felt herself under the globe of an air pump, expected to yield\nup something. When she confined the conversation to matters of general\ninterest Flavia conveyed to her with some pique that her one endeavor\nin life had been to fit herself to converse with her friends upon those\nthings which vitally interested them. “One has no right to accept their\nbest from people unless one gives, isn't it so? I want to be able to\ngive--!” she declared vaguely. Yet whenever Imogen strove to pay her\ntithes and plunged bravely into her plans for study next winter, Flavia\ngrew absent-minded and interrupted her by amazing generalizations or\nby such embarrassing questions as, “And these grim studies really have\ncharm for you; you are quite buried in them; they make other things seem\nlight and ephemeral?”\n\n“I rather feel as though I had got in here under false pretenses,”\n Imogen confided to Miss Broadwood. “I'm sure I don't know what it is\nthat she wants of me.”\n\n“Ah,” chuckled Jemima, “you are not equal to these heart to heart talks\nwith Flavia. You utterly fail to communicate to her the atmosphere of\nthat untroubled joy in which you dwell. You must remember that she gets\nno feeling out of things herself, and she demands that you impart yours\nto her by some process of psychic transmission. I once met a blind girl,\nblind from birth, who could discuss the peculiarities of the Barbizon\nschool with just Flavia's glibness and enthusiasm. Ordinarily Flavia\nknows how to get what she wants from people, and her memory is\nwonderful. One evening I heard her giving Frau Lichtenfeld some random\nimpressions about Hedda Gabler which she extracted from me five years\nago; giving them with an impassioned conviction of which I was never\nguilty. But I have known other people who could appropriate your stories\nand opinions; Flavia is infinitely more subtle than that; she can\nsoak up the very thrash and drift of your daydreams, and take the very\nthrills off your back, as it were.”\n\nAfter some days of unsuccessful effort, Flavia withdrew herself, and\nImogen found Hamilton ready to catch her when she was tossed afield.\nHe seemed only to have been awaiting this crisis, and at once their\nold intimacy reestablished itself as a thing inevitable and beautifully\nprepared for. She convinced herself that she had not been mistaken in\nhim, despite all the doubts that had come up in later years, and this\nrenewal of faith set more than one question thumping in her brain. “How\ndid he, how can he?” she kept repeating with a tinge of her childish\nresentment, “what right had he to waste anything so fine?”\n\nWhen Imogen and Arthur were returning from a walk before luncheon one\nmorning about a week after M. Roux's departure, they noticed an absorbed\ngroup before one of the hall windows. Herr Schotte and Restzhoff sat\non the window seat with a newspaper between them, while Wellington,\nSchemetzkin, and Will Maidenwood looked over their shoulders. They\nseemed intensely interested, Herr Schotte occasionally pounding his\nknees with his fists in ebullitions of barbaric glee. When imogen\nentered the hall, however, the men were all sauntering toward the\nbreakfast room and the paper was lying innocently on the divan. During\nluncheon the personnel of that window group were unwontedly animated and\nagreeable all save Schemetzkin, whose stare was blanker than ever, as\nthough Roux's mantle of insulting indifference had fallen upon him, in\naddition to his own oblivious self-absorption. Will Maidenwood seemed\nembarrassed and annoyed; the chemist employed himself with making polite\nspeeches to Hamilton. Flavia did not come down to lunch--and there was\na malicious gleam under Herr Schotte's eyebrows. Frank Wellington\nannounced nervously that an imperative letter from his protecting\nsyndicate summoned him to the city.\n\nAfter luncheon the men went to the golf links, and Imogen, at the first\nopportunity, possessed herself of the newspaper which had been left on\nthe divan. One of the first things that caught her eye was an article\nheaded “Roux on Tuft Hunters; The Advanced American Woman as He Sees\nHer; Aggressive, Superficial, and Insincere.” The entire interview was\nnothing more nor less than a satiric characterization of Flavia, aquiver\nwith irritation and vitriolic malice. No one could mistake it; it was\ndone with all his deftness of portraiture. Imogen had not finished the\narticle when she heard a footstep, and clutching the paper she started\nprecipitately toward the stairway as Arthur entered. He put out his\nhand, looking critically at her distressed face.\n\n“Wait a moment, Miss Willard,” he said peremptorily, “I want to see\nwhether we can find what it was that so interested our friends this\nmorning. Give me the paper, please.”\n\nImogen grew quite white as he opened the journal. She reached forward\nand crumpled it with her hands. “Please don't, please don't,” she\npleaded; “it's something I don't want you to see. Oh, why will you? it's\njust something low and despicable that you can't notice.”\n\nArthur had gently loosed her hands, and he pointed her to a chair. He\nlit a cigar and read the article through without comment. When he had\nfinished it he walked to the fireplace, struck a match, and tossed the\nflaming journal between the brass andirons.\n\n“You are right,” he remarked as he came back, dusting his hands with his\nhandkerchief. “It's quite impossible to comment. There are extremes of\nblackguardism for which we have no name. The only thing necessary is to\nsee that Flavia gets no wind of this. This seems to be my cue to act;\npoor girl.”\n\nImogen looked at him tearfully; she could only murmur, “Oh, why did you\nread it!”\n\nHamilton laughed spiritlessly. “Come, don't you worry about it. You\nalways took other people's troubles too seriously. When you were little\nand all the world was gay and everybody happy, you must needs get the\nLittle Mermaid's troubles to grieve over. Come with me into the music\nroom. You remember the musical setting I once made you for the Lay of\nthe Jabberwock? I was trying it over the other night, long after you\nwere in bed, and I decided it was quite as fine as the Erl-King music.\nHow I wish I could give you some of the cake that Alice ate and make you\na little girl again. Then, when you had got through the glass door into\nthe little garden, you could call to me, perhaps, and tell me all the\nfine things that were going on there. What a pity it is that you ever\ngrew up!” he added, laughing; and Imogen, too, was thinking just that.\n\nAt dinner that evening, Flavia, with fatal persistence, insisted upon\nturning the conversation to M. Roux. She had been reading one of his\nnovels and had remembered anew that Paris set its watches by his clock.\nImogen surmised that she was tortured by a feeling that she had not\nsufficiently appreciated him while she had had him. When she first\nmentioned his name she was answered only by the pall of silence that\nfell over the company. Then everyone began to talk at once, as though\nto correct a false position. They spoke of him with a fervid, defiant\nadmiration, with the sort of hot praise that covers a double purpose.\nImogen fancied she could see that they felt a kind of relief at what the\nman had done, even those who despised him for doing it; that they felt\na spiteful hate against Flavia, as though she had tricked them, and a\ncertain contempt for themselves that they had been beguiled. She was\nreminded of the fury of the crowd in the fairy tale, when once the child\nhad called out that the king was in his night clothes. Surely these\npeople knew no more about Flavia than they had known before, but the\nmere fact that the thing had been said altered the situation. Flavia,\nmeanwhile, sat chattering amiably, pathetically unconscious of her\nnakedness.\n\nHamilton lounged, fingering the stem of his wineglass, gazing down the\ntable at one face after another and studying the various degrees\nof self-consciousness they exhibited. Imogen's eyes followed his,\nfearfully. When a lull came in the spasmodic flow of conversation,\nArthur, leaning back in his chair, remarked deliberately, “As for M.\nRoux, his very profession places him in that class of men whom society\nhas never been able to accept unconditionally because it has never been\nable to assume that they have any ordered notion of taste. He and\nhis ilk remain, with the mountebanks and snake charmers, people\nindispensable to our civilization, but wholly unreclaimed by it; people\nwhom we receive, but whose invitations we do not accept.”\n\nFortunately for Flavia, this mine was not exploded until just before the\ncoffee was brought. Her laughter was pitiful to hear; it echoed through\nthe silent room as in a vault, while she made some tremulously light\nremark about her husband's drollery, grim as a jest from the dying. No\none responded and she sat nodding her head like a mechanical toy and\nsmiling her white, set smile through her teeth, until Alcee Buisson and\nFrau Lichtenfeld came to her support.\n\nAfter dinner the guests retired immediately to their rooms, and Imogen\nwent upstairs on tiptoe, feeling the echo of breakage and the dust of\ncrumbling in the air. She wondered whether Flavia's habitual note of\nuneasiness were not, in a manner, prophetic, and a sort of unconscious\npremonition, after all. She sat down to write a letter, but she found\nherself so nervous, her head so hot and her hands so cold, that she\nsoon abandoned the effort, just as she was about to seek Miss Broadwood,\nFlavia entered and embraced her hysterically.\n\n“My dearest girl,” she began, “was there ever such an unfortunate and\nincomprehensible speech made before? Of course it is scarcely necessary\nto explain to you poor Arthur's lack of tact, and that he meant nothing.\nBut they! Can they be expected to understand? He will feel wretchedly\nabout it when he realizes what he has done, but in the meantime? And M.\nRoux, of all men! When we were so fortunate as to get him, and he made\nhimself so unreservedly agreeable, and I fancied that, in his way,\nArthur quite admired him. My dear, you have no idea what that speech has\ndone. Schemetzkin and Herr Schotte have already sent me word that they\nmust leave us tomorrow. Such a thing from a host!” Flavia paused, choked\nby tears of vexation and despair.\n\nImogen was thoroughly disconcerted; this was the first time she had ever\nseen Flavia betray any personal emotion which was indubitably genuine.\nShe replied with what consolation she could. “Need they take it\npersonally at all? It was a mere observation upon a class of people--”\n\n“Which he knows nothing whatever about, and with whom he has no\nsympathy,” interrupted Flavia. “Ah, my dear, you could not be _expected_\nto understand. You can't realize, knowing Arthur as you do, his entire\nlack of any aesthetic sense whatever. He is absolutely _nil_, stone deaf\nand stark blind, on that side. He doesn't mean to be brutal, it is\njust the brutality of utter ignorance. They always feel it--they are so\nsensitive to unsympathetic influences, you know; they know it the moment\nthey come into the house. I have spent my life apologizing for him and\nstruggling to conceal it; but in spite of me, he wounds them; his very\nattitude, even in silence, offends them. Heavens! Do I not know? Is\nit not perpetually and forever wounding me? But there has never been\nanything so dreadful as this--never! If I could conceive of any possible\nmotive, even!”\n\n“But, surely, Mrs. Hamilton, it was, after all, a mere expression of\nopinion, such as we are any of us likely to venture upon any subject\nwhatever. It was neither more personal nor more extravagant than many of\nM. Roux's remarks.”\n\n“But, Imogen, certainly M. Roux has the right. It is a part of his\nart, and that is altogether another matter. Oh, this is not the only\ninstance!” continued Flavia passionately, “I've always had that narrow,\nbigoted prejudice to contend with. It has always held me back. But\nthis--!”\n\n“I think you mistake his attitude,” replied Imogen, feeling a flush that\nmade her ears tingle. “That is, I fancy he is more appreciative than he\nseems. A man can't be very demonstrative about those things--not if he\nis a real man. I should not think you would care much about saving the\nfeelings of people who are too narrow to admit of any other point of\nview than their own.” She stopped, finding herself in the impossible\nposition of attempting to explain Hamilton to his wife; a task which,\nif once begun, would necessitate an entire course of enlightenment which\nshe doubted Flavia's ability to receive, and which she could offer only\nwith very poor grace.\n\n“That's just where it stings most”--here Flavia began pacing the\nfloor--“it is just because they have all shown such tolerance and have\ntreated Arthur with such unfailing consideration that I can find no\nreasonable pretext for his rancor. How can he fail to see the value of\nsuch friendships on the children's account, if for nothing else! What\nan advantage for them to grow up among such associations! Even though he\ncares nothing about these things himself he might realize that. Is there\nnothing I could say by way of explanation? To them, I mean? If someone\nwere to explain to them how unfortunately limited he is in these\nthings--”\n\n“I'm afraid I cannot advise you,” said Imogen decidedly, “but that, at\nleast, seems to me impossible.”\n\nFlavia took her hand and glanced at her affectionately, nodding\nnervously. “Of course, dear girl, I can't ask you to be quite frank with\nme. Poor child, you are trembling and your hands are icy. Poor Arthur!\nBut you must not judge him by this altogether; think how much he misses\nin life. What a cruel shock you've had. I'll send you some sherry, Good\nnight, my dear.”\n\nWhen Flavia shut the door Imogen burst into a fit of nervous weeping.\n\nNext morning she awoke after a troubled and restless night. At eight\no'clock Miss Broadwood entered in a red and white striped bathrobe.\n\n“Up, up, and see the great doom's image!” she cried, her eyes sparkling\nwith excitement. “The hall is full of trunks, they are packing. What\nbolt has fallen? It's you, _ma cherie_, you've brought Ulysses\nhome again and the slaughter has begun!” she blew a cloud of smoke\ntriumphantly from her lips and threw herself into a chair beside the\nbed.\n\nImogen, rising on her elbow, plunged excitedly into the story of the\nRoux interview, which Miss Broadwood heard with the keenest interest,\nfrequently interrupting her with exclamations of delight. When Imogen\nreached the dramatic scene which terminated in the destruction of the\nnewspaper, Miss Broadwood rose and took a turn about the room, violently\nswitching the tasselled cords of her bathrobe.\n\n“Stop a moment,” she cried, “you mean to tell me that he had such a\nheaven-sent means to bring her to her senses and didn't use it--that he\nheld such a weapon and threw it away?”\n\n“Use it?” cried Imogen unsteadily. “Of course he didn't! He bared his\nback to the tormentor, signed himself over to punishment in that speech\nhe made at dinner, which everyone understands but Flavia. She was here\nfor an hour last night and disregarded every limit of taste in her\nmaledictions.”\n\n“My dear!” cried Miss Broadwood, catching her hand in inordinate delight\nat the situation, “do you see what he has done? There'll be no end to\nit. Why he has sacrificed himself to spare the very vanity that devours\nhim, put rancors in the vessels of his peace, and his eternal jewel\ngiven to the common enemy of man, to make them kings, the seed of Banquo\nkings! He is magnificent!”\n\n“Isn't he always that?” cried Imogen hotly. “He's like a pillar of\nsanity and law in this house of shams and swollen vanities, where people\nstalk about with a sort of madhouse dignity, each one fancying himself a\nking or a pope. If you could have heard that woman talk of him! Why,\nshe thinks him stupid, bigoted, blinded by middleclass prejudices. She\ntalked about his having no aesthetic sense and insisted that her artists\nhad always shown him tolerance. I don't know why it should get on my\nnerves so, I'm sure, but her stupidity and assurance are enough to drive\none to the brink of collapse.”\n\n“Yes, as opposed to his singular fineness, they are calculated to do\njust that,” said Miss Broadwood gravely, wisely ignoring Imogen's tears.\n“But what has been is nothing to what will be. Just wait until Flavia's\nblack swans have flown! You ought not to try to stick it out; that would\nonly make it harder for everyone. Suppose you let me telephone your\nmother to wire you to come home by the evening train?”\n\n“Anything, rather than have her come at me like that again. It puts me\nin a perfectly impossible position, and he _is_ so fine!”\n\n“Of course it does,” said Miss Broadwood sympathetically, “and there\nis no good to be got from facing it. I will stay because such things\ninterest me, and Frau Lichtenfeld will stay because she has no money to\nget away, and Buisson will stay because he feels somewhat responsible.\nThese complications are interesting enough to cold-blooded folk\nlike myself who have an eye for the dramatic element, but they are\ndistracting and demoralizing to young people with any serious purpose in\nlife.”\n\nMiss Broadwood's counsel was all the more generous seeing that, for her,\nthe most interesting element of this denouement would be eliminated by\nImogen's departure. “If she goes now, she'll get over it,” soliloquized\nMiss Broadwood. “If she stays, she'll be wrung for him and the hurt may\ngo deep enough to last. I haven't the heart to see her spoiling things\nfor herself.” She telephoned Mrs. Willard and helped Imogen to pack. She\neven took it upon herself to break the news of Imogen's going to Arthur,\nwho remarked, as he rolled a cigarette in his nerveless fingers:\n\n“Right enough, too. What should she do here with old cynics like you and\nme, Jimmy? Seeing that she is brim full of dates and formulae and other\npositivisms, and is so girt about with illusions that she still casts\na shadow in the sun. You've been very tender of her, haven't you? I've\nwatched you. And to think it may all be gone when we see her next. 'The\ncommon fate of all things rare,' you know. What a good fellow you\nare, anyway, Jimmy,” he added, putting his hands affectionately on her\nshoulders.\n\nArthur went with them to the station. Flavia was so prostrated by the\nconcerted action of her guests that she was able to see Imogen only\nfor a moment in her darkened sleeping chamber, where she kissed her\nhysterically, without lifting her head, bandaged in aromatic vinegar.\nOn the way to the station both Arthur and Imogen threw the burden of\nkeeping up appearances entirely upon Miss Broadwood, who blithely rose\nto the occasion. When Hamilton carried Imogen's bag into the car, Miss\nBroadwood detained her for a moment, whispering as she gave her a large,\nwarm handclasp, “I'll come to see you when I get back to town; and, in\nthe meantime, if you meet any of our artists, tell them you have left\nCaius Marius among the ruins of Carthage.”\n\n\n\n\nThe Sculptor's Funeral\n\nA group of the townspeople stood on the station siding of a little\nKansas town, awaiting the coming of the night train, which was already\ntwenty minutes overdue. The snow had fallen thick over everything; in\nthe pale starlight the line of bluffs across the wide, white meadows\nsouth of the town made soft, smoke-colored curves against the clear sky.\nThe men on the siding stood first on one foot and then on the other,\ntheir hands thrust deep into their trousers pockets, their overcoats\nopen, their shoulders screwed up with the cold; and they glanced from\ntime to time toward the southeast, where the railroad track wound along\nthe river shore. They conversed in low tones and moved about restlessly,\nseeming uncertain as to what was expected of them. There was but one of\nthe company who looked as though he knew exactly why he was there; and\nhe kept conspicuously apart; walking to the far end of the platform,\nreturning to the station door, then pacing up the track again, his chin\nsunk in the high collar of his overcoat, his burly shoulders drooping\nforward, his gait heavy and dogged. Presently he was approached by a\ntall, spare, grizzled man clad in a faded Grand Army suit, who shuffled\nout from the group and advanced with a certain deference, craning his\nneck forward until his back made the angle of a jackknife three-quarters\nopen.\n\n“I reckon she's agoin' to be pretty late ag'in tonight, Jim,” he\nremarked in a squeaky falsetto. “S'pose it's the snow?”\n\n“I don't know,” responded the other man with a shade of annoyance,\nspeaking from out an astonishing cataract of red beard that grew\nfiercely and thickly in all directions.\n\nThe spare man shifted the quill toothpick he was chewing to the other\nside of his mouth. “It ain't likely that anybody from the East will come\nwith the corpse, I s'pose,” he went on reflectively.\n\n“I don't know,” responded the other, more curtly than before.\n\n“It's too bad he didn't belong to some lodge or other. I like an\norder funeral myself. They seem more appropriate for people of some\nreputation,” the spare man continued, with an ingratiating concession\nin his shrill voice, as he carefully placed his toothpick in his vest\npocket. He always carried the flag at the G. A. R. funerals in the town.\n\nThe heavy man turned on his heel, without replying, and walked up the\nsiding. The spare man shuffled back to the uneasy group. “Jim's ez full\nez a tick, ez ushel,” he commented commiseratingly.\n\nJust then a distant whistle sounded, and there was a shuffling of feet\non the platform. A number of lanky boys of all ages appeared as suddenly\nand slimily as eels wakened by the crack of thunder; some came from the\nwaiting room, where they had been warming themselves by the red stove,\nor half-asleep on the slat benches; others uncoiled themselves from\nbaggage trucks or slid out of express wagons. Two clambered down from\nthe driver's seat of a hearse that stood backed up against the siding.\nThey straightened their stooping shoulders and lifted their heads, and\na flash of momentary animation kindled their dull eyes at that cold,\nvibrant scream, the world-wide call for men. It stirred them like the\nnote of a trumpet; just as it had often stirred the man who was coming\nhome tonight, in his boyhood.\n\nThe night express shot, red as a rocket, from out the eastward marsh\nlands and wound along the river shore under the long lines of shivering\npoplars that sentineled the meadows, the escaping steam hanging in gray\nmasses against the pale sky and blotting out the Milky Way. In a moment\nthe red glare from the headlight streamed up the snow-covered track\nbefore the siding and glittered on the wet, black rails. The burly man\nwith the disheveled red beard walked swiftly up the platform toward\nthe approaching train, uncovering his head as he went. The group of\nmen behind him hesitated, glanced questioningly at one another, and\nawkwardly followed his example. The train stopped, and the crowd\nshuffled up to the express car just as the door was thrown open,\nthe spare man in the G. A. B. suit thrusting his head forward with\ncuriosity. The express messenger appeared in the doorway, accompanied by\na young man in a long ulster and traveling cap.\n\n“Are Mr. Merrick's friends here?” inquired the young man.\n\nThe group on the platform swayed and shuffled uneasily. Philip Phelps,\nthe banker, responded with dignity: “We have come to take charge of the\nbody. Mr. Merrick's father is very feeble and can't be about.”\n\n“Send the agent out here,” growled the express messenger, “and tell the\noperator to lend a hand.”\n\nThe coffin was got out of its rough box and down on the snowy platform.\nThe townspeople drew back enough to make room for it and then formed a\nclose semicircle about it, looking curiously at the palm leaf which lay\nacross the black cover. No one said anything. The baggage man stood by\nhis truck, waiting to get at the trunks. The engine panted heavily, and\nthe fireman dodged in and out among the wheels with his yellow torch and\nlong oilcan, snapping the spindle boxes. The young Bostonian, one of\nthe dead sculptor's pupils who had come with the body, looked about him\nhelplessly. He turned to the banker, the only one of that black,\nuneasy, stoop-shouldered group who seemed enough of an individual to be\naddressed.\n\n“None of Mr. Merrick's brothers are here?” he asked uncertainly.\n\nThe man with the red heard for the first time stepped up and joined the\ngroup. “No, they have not come yet; the family is scattered. The body\nwill be taken directly to the house.” He stooped and took hold of one of\nthe handles of the coffin.\n\n“Take the long hill road up, Thompson--it will be easier on the horses,”\n called the liveryman as the undertaker snapped the door of the hearse\nand prepared to mount to the driver's seat.\n\nLaird, the red-bearded lawyer, turned again to the stranger: “We didn't\nknow whether there would be anyone with him or not,” he explained. “It's\na long walk, so you'd better go up in the hack.” He pointed to a single,\nbattered conveyance, but the young man replied stiffly: “Thank you, but\nI think I will go up with the hearse. If you don't object,” turning to\nthe undertaker, “I'll ride with you.”\n\nThey clambered up over the wheels and drove off in the starlight tip the\nlong, white hill toward the town. The lamps in the still village were\nshining from under the low, snow-burdened roofs; and beyond, on every\nside, the plains reached out into emptiness, peaceful and wide as the\nsoft sky itself, and wrapped in a tangible, white silence.\n\nWhen the hearse backed up to a wooden sidewalk before a naked,\nweatherbeaten frame house, the same composite, ill-defined group that\nhad stood upon the station siding was huddled about the gate. The front\nyard was an icy swamp, and a couple of warped planks, extending from the\nsidewalk to the door, made a sort of rickety footbridge. The gate hung\non one hinge and was opened wide with difficulty. Steavens, the young\nstranger, noticed that something black was tied to the knob of the front\ndoor.\n\nThe grating sound made by the casket, as it was drawn from the hearse,\nwas answered by a scream from the house; the front door was wrenched\nopen, and a tall, corpulent woman rushed out bareheaded into the snow\nand flung herself upon the coffin, shrieking: “My boy, my boy! And this\nis how you've come home to me!”\n\nAs Steavens turned away and closed his eyes with a shudder of\nunutterable repulsion, another woman, also tall, but flat and angular,\ndressed entirely in black, darted out of the house and caught Mrs.\nMerrick by the shoulders, crying sharply: “Come, come, Mother; you\nmustn't go on like this!” Her tone changed to one of obsequious\nsolemnity as she turned to the banker: “The parlor is ready, Mr.\nPhelps.”\n\nThe bearers carried the coffin along the narrow boards, while the\nundertaker ran ahead with the coffin-rests. They bore it into a large,\nunheated room that smelled of dampness and disuse and furniture polish,\nand set it down under a hanging lamp ornamented with jingling glass\nprisms and before a “Rogers group” of John Alden and Priscilla,\nwreathed with smilax. Henry Steavens stared about him with the sickening\nconviction that there had been some horrible mistake, and that he had\nsomehow arrived at the wrong destination. He looked painfully about\nover the clover-green Brussels, the fat plush upholstery, among the\nhand-painted china plaques and panels, and vases, for some mark of\nidentification, for something that might once conceivably have belonged\nto Harvey Merrick. It was not until he recognized his friend in the\ncrayon portrait of a little boy in kilts and curls hanging above the\npiano that he felt willing to let any of these people approach the\ncoffin.\n\n“Take the lid off, Mr. Thompson; let me see my boy's face,” wailed\nthe elder woman between her sobs. This time Steavens looked fearfully,\nalmost beseechingly into her face, red and swollen under its masses\nof strong, black, shiny hair. He flushed, dropped his eyes, and then,\nalmost incredulously, looked again. There was a kind of power about\nher face--a kind of brutal handsomeness, even, but it was scarred and\nfurrowed by violence, and so colored and coarsened by fiercer passions\nthat grief seemed never to have laid a gentle finger there. The long\nnose was distended and knobbed at the end, and there were deep lines\non either side of it; her heavy, black brows almost met across her\nforehead; her teeth were large and square and set far apart--teeth that\ncould tear. She filled the room; the men were obliterated, seemed tossed\nabout like twigs in an angry water, and even Steavens felt himself being\ndrawn into the whirlpool.\n\nThe daughter--the tall, rawboned woman in crepe, with a mourning comb in\nher hair which curiously lengthened her long face sat stiffly upon the\nsofa, her hands, conspicuous for their large knuckles, folded in her\nlap, her mouth and eyes drawn down, solemnly awaiting the opening of the\ncoffin. Near the door stood a mulatto woman, evidently a servant in\nthe house, with a timid bearing and an emaciated face pitifully sad and\ngentle. She was weeping silently, the corner of her calico apron lifted\nto her eyes, occasionally suppressing a long, quivering sob. Steavens\nwalked over and stood beside her.\n\nFeeble steps were heard on the stairs, and an old man, tall and frail,\nodorous of pipe smoke, with shaggy, unkept gray hair and a dingy beard,\ntobacco stained about the mouth, entered uncertainly. He went slowly up\nto the coffin and stood, rolling a blue cotton handkerchief between his\nhands, seeming so pained and embarrassed by his wife's orgy of grief\nthat he had no consciousness of anything else.\n\n“There, there, Annie, dear, don't take on so,” he quavered timidly,\nputting out a shaking hand and awkwardly patting her elbow. She turned\nwith a cry and sank upon his shoulder with such violence that he\ntottered a little. He did not even glance toward the coffin, but\ncontinued to look at her with a dull, frightened, appealing expression,\nas a spaniel looks at the whip. His sunken cheeks slowly reddened and\nburned with miserable shame. When his wife rushed from the room her\ndaughter strode after her with set lips. The servant stole up to the\ncoffin, bent over it for a moment, and then slipped away to the kitchen,\nleaving Steavens, the lawyer, and the father to themselves. The old man\nstood trembling and looking down at his dead son's face. The sculptor's\nsplendid head seemed even more noble in its rigid stillness than in\nlife. The dark hair had crept down upon the wide forehead; the face\nseemed strangely long, but in it there was not that beautiful and chaste\nrepose which we expect to find in the faces of the dead. The brows were\nso drawn that there were two deep lines above the beaked nose, and the\nchin was thrust forward defiantly. It was as though the strain of life\nhad been so sharp and bitter that death could not at once wholly relax\nthe tension and smooth the countenance into perfect peace--as though he\nwere still guarding something precious and holy, which might even yet be\nwrested from him.\n\nThe old man's lips were working under his stained beard. He turned to\nthe lawyer with timid deference: “Phelps and the rest are comin' back to\nset up with Harve, ain't they?” he asked. “Thank 'ee, Jim, thank 'ee.”\n He brushed the hair back gently from his son's forehead. “He was a good\nboy, Jim; always a good boy. He was ez gentle ez a child and the kindest\nof 'em all--only we didn't none of us ever onderstand him.” The tears\ntrickled slowly down his beard and dropped upon the sculptor's coat.\n\n“Martin, Martin. Oh, Martin! come here,” his wife wailed from the top of\nthe stairs. The old man started timorously: “Yes, Annie, I'm coming.” He\nturned away, hesitated stood for a moment in miserable indecision; then\nhe reached back and patted the dead man's hair softly, and stumbled from\nthe room.\n\n“Poor old man, I didn't think he had any tears left. Seems as if his\neyes would have gone dry long ago. At his age nothing cuts very deep,”\n remarked the lawyer.\n\nSomething in his tone made Steavens glance up. While the mother had been\nin the room the young man had scarcely seen anyone else; but now, from\nthe moment he first glanced into Jim Laird's florid face and bloodshot\neyes, he knew that he had found what he had been heartsick at not\nfinding before--the feeling, the understanding, that must exist in\nsomeone, even here.\n\nThe man was red as his beard, with features swollen and blurred by\ndissipation, and a hot, blazing blue eye. His face was strained--that of\na man who is controlling himself with difficulty--and he kept plucking\nat his beard with a sort of fierce resentment. Steavens, sitting by\nthe window, watched him turn down the glaring lamp, still its jangling\npendants with an angry gesture, and then stand with his hands locked\nbehind him, staring down into the master's face. He could not help\nwondering what link there could have been between the porcelain vessel\nand so sooty a lump of potter's clay.\n\nFrom the kitchen an uproar was sounding; when the dining-room door\nopened the import of it was clear. The mother was abusing the maid for\nhaving forgotten to make the dressing for the chicken salad which had\nbeen prepared for the watchers. Steavens had never heard anything in\nthe least like it; it was injured, emotional, dramatic abuse, unique and\nmasterly in its excruciating cruelty, as violent and unrestrained as had\nbeen her grief of twenty minutes before. With a shudder of disgust the\nlawyer went into the dining room and closed the door into the kitchen.\n\n“Poor Roxy's getting it now,” he remarked when he came back. “The\nMerricks took her out of the poorhouse years ago; and if her loyalty\nwould let her, I guess the poor old thing could tell tales that would\ncurdle your blood. She's the mulatto woman who was standing in here a\nwhile ago, with her apron to her eyes. The old woman is a fury; there\nnever was anybody like her for demonstrative piety and ingenious\ncruelty. She made Harvey's life a hell for him when he lived at home;\nhe was so sick ashamed of it. I never could see how he kept himself so\nsweet.”\n\n“He was wonderful,” said Steavens slowly, “wonderful; but until tonight\nI have never known how wonderful.”\n\n“That is the true and eternal wonder of it, anyway; that it can come\neven from such a dung heap as this,” the lawyer cried, with a sweeping\ngesture which seemed to indicate much more than the four walls within\nwhich they stood.\n\n“I think I'll see whether I can get a little air. The room is so close\nI am beginning to feel rather faint,” murmured Steavens, struggling with\none of the windows. The sash was stuck, however, and would not yield, so\nhe sat down dejectedly and began pulling at his collar. The lawyer came\nover, loosened the sash with one blow of his red fist, and sent the\nwindow up a few inches. Steavens thanked him, but the nausea which had\nbeen gradually climbing into his throat for the last half-hour left him\nwith but one desire--a desperate feeling that he must get away from this\nplace with what was left of Harvey Merrick. Oh, he comprehended well\nenough now the quiet bitterness of the smile that he had seen so often\non his master's lips!\n\nHe remembered that once, when Merrick returned from a visit home, he\nbrought with him a singularly feeling and suggestive bas-relief of a\nthin, faded old woman, sitting and sewing something pinned to her knee;\nwhile a full-lipped, full-blooded little urchin, his trousers held up\nby a single gallows, stood beside her, impatiently twitching her gown to\ncall her attention to a butterfly he had caught. Steavens, impressed by\nthe tender and delicate modeling of the thin, tired face, had asked him\nif it were his mother. He remembered the dull flush that had burned up\nin the sculptor's face.\n\nThe lawyer was sitting in a rocking chair beside the coffin, his head\nthrown back and his eyes closed. Steavens looked at him earnestly,\npuzzled at the line of the chin, and wondering why a man should conceal\na feature of such distinction under that disfiguring shock of beard.\nSuddenly, as though he felt the young sculptor's keen glance, he opened\nhis eyes.\n\n“Was he always a good deal of an oyster?” he asked abruptly. “He was\nterribly shy as a boy.”\n\n“Yes, he was an oyster, since you put it so,” rejoined Steavens.\n“Although he could be very fond of people, he always gave one the\nimpression of being detached. He disliked violent emotion; he was\nreflective, and rather distrustful of himself--except, of course, as\nregarded his work. He was surefooted enough there. He distrusted men\npretty thoroughly and women even more, yet somehow without believing ill\nof them. He was determined, indeed, to believe the best, but he seemed\nafraid to investigate.”\n\n“A burnt dog dreads the fire,” said the lawyer grimly, and closed his\neyes.\n\nSteavens went on and on, reconstructing that whole miserable boyhood.\nAll this raw, biting ugliness had been the portion of the man whose\ntastes were refined beyond the limits of the reasonable--whose mind was\nan exhaustless gallery of beautiful impressions, and so sensitive that\nthe mere shadow of a poplar leaf flickering against a sunny wall would\nbe etched and held there forever. Surely, if ever a man had the magic\nword in his fingertips, it was Merrick. Whatever he touched, he revealed\nits holiest secret; liberated it from enchantment and restored it to its\npristine loveliness, like the Arabian prince who fought the enchantress\nspell for spell. Upon whatever he had come in contact with, he had left\na beautiful record of the experience--a sort of ethereal signature; a\nscent, a sound, a color that was his own.\n\nSteavens understood now the real tragedy of his master's life; neither\nlove nor wine, as many had conjectured, but a blow which had fallen\nearlier and cut deeper than these could have done--a shame not his, and\nyet so unescapably his, to bide in his heart from his very boyhood. And\nwithout--the frontier warfare; the yearning of a boy, cast ashore upon a\ndesert of newness and ugliness and sordidness, for all that is chastened\nand old, and noble with traditions.\n\nAt eleven o'clock the tall, flat woman in black crepe entered, announced\nthat the watchers were arriving, and asked them “to step into the dining\nroom.” As Steavens rose the lawyer said dryly: “You go on--it'll be a\ngood experience for you, doubtless; as for me, I'm not equal to that\ncrowd tonight; I've had twenty years of them.”\n\nAs Steavens closed the door after him be glanced back at the lawyer,\nsitting by the coffin in the dim light, with his chin resting on his\nhand.\n\nThe same misty group that had stood before the door of the express car\nshuffled into the dining room. In the light of the kerosene lamp they\nseparated and became individuals. The minister, a pale, feeble-looking\nman with white hair and blond chin-whiskers, took his seat beside a\nsmall side table and placed his Bible upon it. The Grand Army man sat\ndown behind the stove and tilted his chair back comfortably against the\nwall, fishing his quill toothpick from his waistcoat pocket. The two\nbankers, Phelps and Elder, sat off in a corner behind the dinner table,\nwhere they could finish their discussion of the new usury law and its\neffect on chattel security loans. The real estate agent, an old man\nwith a smiling, hypocritical face, soon joined them. The coal-and-lumber\ndealer and the cattle shipper sat on opposite sides of the hard\ncoal-burner, their feet on the nickelwork. Steavens took a book from\nhis pocket and began to read. The talk around him ranged through various\ntopics of local interest while the house was quieting down. When it\nwas clear that the members of the family were in bed the Grand Army man\nhitched his shoulders and, untangling his long legs, caught his heels on\nthe rounds of his chair.\n\n“S'pose there'll be a will, Phelps?” he queried in his weak falsetto.\n\nThe banker laughed disagreeably and began trimming his nails with a\npearl-handled pocketknife.\n\n“There'll scarcely be any need for one, will there?” he queried in his\nturn.\n\nThe restless Grand Army man shifted his position again, getting his\nknees still nearer his chin. “Why, the ole man says Harve's done right\nwell lately,” he chirped.\n\nThe other banker spoke up. “I reckon he means by that Harve ain't asked\nhim to mortgage any more farms lately, so as he could go on with his\neducation.”\n\n“Seems like my mind don't reach back to a time when Harve wasn't bein'\nedycated,” tittered the Grand Army man.\n\nThere was a general chuckle. The minister took out his handkerchief and\nblew his nose sonorously. Banker Phelps closed his knife with a snap.\n“It's too bad the old man's sons didn't turn out better,” he remarked\nwith reflective authority. “They never hung together. He spent money\nenough on Harve to stock a dozen cattle farms and he might as well have\npoured it into Sand Creek. If Harve had stayed at home and helped nurse\nwhat little they had, and gone into stock on the old man's bottom\nfarm, they might all have been well fixed. But the old man had to trust\neverything to tenants and was cheated right and left.”\n\n“Harve never could have handled stock none,” interposed the cattleman.\n“He hadn't it in him to be sharp. Do you remember when he bought\nSander's mules for eight-year-olds, when everybody in town knew that\nSander's father-in-law give 'em to his wife for a wedding present\neighteen years before, an' they was full-grown mules then.”\n\nEveryone chuckled, and the Grand Army man rubbed his knees with a spasm\nof childish delight.\n\n“Harve never was much account for anything practical, and he shore was\nnever fond of work,” began the coal-and-lumber dealer. “I mind the last\ntime he was home; the day he left, when the old man was out to the barn\nhelpin' his hand hitch up to take Harve to the train, and Cal Moots was\npatchin' up the fence, Harve, he come out on the step and sings out, in\nhis ladylike voice: 'Cal Moots, Cal Moots! please come cord my trunk.'”\n\n“That's Harve for you,” approved the Grand Army man gleefully. “I kin\nhear him howlin' yet when he was a big feller in long pants and his\nmother used to whale him with a rawhide in the barn for lettin' the\ncows git foundered in the cornfield when he was drivin' 'em home from\npasture. He killed a cow of mine that-a-way onc't--a pure Jersey and the\nbest milker I had, an' the ole man had to put up for her. Harve, he was\nwatchin' the sun set acros't the marshes when the anamile got away; he\nargued that sunset was oncommon fine.”\n\n“Where the old man made his mistake was in sending the boy East to\nschool,” said Phelps, stroking his goatee and speaking in a deliberate,\njudicial tone. “There was where he got his head full of traipsing to\nParis and all such folly. What Harve needed, of all people, was a course\nin some first-class Kansas City business college.”\n\nThe letters were swimming before Steavens's eyes. Was it possible that\nthese men did not understand, that the palm on the coffin meant nothing\nto them? The very name of their town would have remained forever buried\nin the postal guide had it not been now and again mentioned in the world\nin connection with Harvey Merrick's. He remembered what his master had\nsaid to him on the day of his death, after the congestion of both lungs\nhad shut off any probability of recovery, and the sculptor had asked\nhis pupil to send his body home. “It's not a pleasant place to be lying\nwhile the world is moving and doing and bettering,” he had said with a\nfeeble smile, “but it rather seems as though we ought to go back to the\nplace we came from in the end. The townspeople will come in for a look\nat me; and after they have had their say I shan't have much to fear from\nthe judgment of God. The wings of the Victory, in there”--with a weak\ngesture toward his studio--“will not shelter me.”\n\nThe cattleman took up the comment. “Forty's young for a Merrick to cash\nin; they usually hang on pretty well. Probably he helped it along with\nwhisky.”\n\n“His mother's people were not long-lived, and Harvey never had a robust\nconstitution,” said the minister mildly. He would have liked to say\nmore. He had been the boy's Sunday-school teacher, and had been fond of\nhim; but he felt that he was not in a position to speak. His own sons\nhad turned out badly, and it was not a year since one of them had made\nhis last trip home in the express car, shot in a gambling house in the\nBlack Hills.\n\n“Nevertheless, there is no disputin' that Harve frequently looked upon\nthe wine when it was red, also variegated, and it shore made an oncommon\nfool of him,” moralized the cattleman.\n\nJust then the door leading into the parlor rattled loudly, and everyone\nstarted involuntarily, looking relieved when only Jim Laird came out.\nHis red face was convulsed with anger, and the Grand Army man ducked\nhis head when he saw the spark in his blue, bloodshot eye. They were all\nafraid of Jim; he was a drunkard, but he could twist the law to suit his\nclient's needs as no other man in all western Kansas could do; and\nthere were many who tried. The lawyer closed the door gently behind him,\nleaned back against it and folded his arms, cocking his head a little\nto one side. When he assumed this attitude in the courtroom, ears were\nalways pricked up, as it usually foretold a flood of withering sarcasm.\n\n“I've been with you gentlemen before,” he began in a dry, even tone,\n“when you've sat by the coffins of boys born and raised in this town;\nand, if I remember rightly, you were never any too well satisfied when\nyou checked them up. What's the matter, anyhow? Why is it that reputable\nyoung men are as scarce as millionaires in Sand City? It might almost\nseem to a stranger that there was some way something the matter with\nyour progressive town. Why did Ruben Sayer, the brightest young lawyer\nyou ever turned out, after he had come home from the university as\nstraight as a die, take to drinking and forge a check and shoot himself?\nWhy did Bill Merrit's son die of the shakes in a saloon in Omaha? Why\nwas Mr. Thomas's son, here, shot in a gambling house? Why did young\nAdams burn his mill to beat the insurance companies and go to the pen?”\n\nThe lawyer paused and unfolded his arms, laying one clenched fist\nquietly on the table. “I'll tell you why. Because you drummed\nnothing but money and knavery into their ears from the time they wore\nknickerbockers; because you carped away at them as you've been carping\nhere tonight, holding our friends Phelps and Elder up to them for their\nmodels, as our grandfathers held up George Washington and John Adams.\nBut the boys, worse luck, were young and raw at the business you put\nthem to; and how could they match coppers with such artists as Phelps\nand Elder? You wanted them to be successful rascals; they were only\nunsuccessful ones--that's all the difference. There was only one boy\never raised in this borderland between ruffianism and civilization who\ndidn't come to grief, and you hated Harvey Merrick more for winning out\nthan you hated all the other boys who got under the wheels. Lord, Lord,\nhow you did hate him! Phelps, here, is fond of saying that he could buy\nand sell us all out any time he's a mind to; but he knew Harve wouldn't\nhave given a tinker's damn for his bank and all his cattle farms put\ntogether; and a lack of appreciation, that way, goes hard with Phelps.\n\n“Old Nimrod, here, thinks Harve drank too much; and this from such as\nNimrod and me!”\n\n“Brother Elder says Harve was too free with the old man's money--fell\nshort in filial consideration, maybe. Well, we can all remember the\nvery tone in which brother Elder swore his own father was a liar, in\nthe county court; and we all know that the old man came out of that\npartnership with his son as bare as a sheared lamb. But maybe I'm\ngetting personal, and I'd better be driving ahead at what I want to\nsay.”\n\nThe lawyer paused a moment, squared his heavy shoulders, and went on:\n“Harvey Merrick and I went to school together, back East. We were dead\nin earnest, and we wanted you all to be proud of us some day. We\nmeant to be great men. Even I, and I haven't lost my sense of humor,\ngentlemen, I meant to be a great man. I came back here to practice, and\nI found you didn't in the least want me to be a great man. You wanted me\nto be a shrewd lawyer--oh, yes! Our veteran here wanted me to get him\nan increase of pension, because he had dyspepsia; Phelps wanted a new\ncounty survey that would put the widow Wilson's little bottom farm\ninside his south line; Elder wanted to lend money at 5 per cent a month\nand get it collected; old Stark here wanted to wheedle old women up in\nVermont into investing their annuities in real estate mortgages that are\nnot worth the paper they are written on. Oh, you needed me hard enough,\nand you'll go on needing me; and that's why I'm not afraid to plug the\ntruth home to you this once.\n\n“Well, I came back here and became the damned shyster you wanted me\nto be. You pretend to have some sort of respect for me; and yet you'll\nstand up and throw mud at Harvey Merrick, whose soul you couldn't dirty\nand whose hands you couldn't tie. Oh, you're a discriminating lot of\nChristians! There have been times when the sight of Harvey's name in\nsome Eastern paper has made me hang my head like a whipped dog; and,\nagain, times when I liked to think of him off there in the world, away\nfrom all this hog wallow, doing his great work and climbing the big,\nclean upgrade he'd set for himself.\n\n“And we? Now that we've fought and lied and sweated and stolen, and\nhated as only the disappointed strugglers in a bitter, dead little\nWestern town know how to do, what have we got to show for it? Harvey\nMerrick wouldn't have given one sunset over your marshes for all you've\ngot put together, and you know it. It's not for me to say why, in the\ninscrutable wisdom of God, a genius should ever have been called from\nthis place of hatred and bitter waters; but I want this Boston man to\nknow that the drivel he's been hearing here tonight is the only\ntribute any truly great man could ever have from such a lot of sick,\nside-tracked, burnt-dog, land-poor sharks as the here-present financiers\nof Sand City--upon which town may God have mercy!”\n\nThe lawyer thrust out his hand to Steavens as he passed him, caught up\nhis overcoat in the hall, and had left the house before the Grand Army\nman had had time to lift his ducked head and crane his long neck about\nat his fellows.\n\n\nNext day Jim Laird was drunk and unable to attend the funeral services.\nSteavens called twice at his office, but was compelled to start East\nwithout seeing him. He had a presentiment that he would hear from him\nagain, and left his address on the lawyer's table; but if Laird found\nit, he never acknowledged it. The thing in him that Harvey Merrick had\nloved must have gone underground with Harvey Merrick's coffin; for it\nnever spoke again, and Jim got the cold he died of driving across the\nColorado mountains to defend one of Phelps's sons, who had got into\ntrouble out there by cutting government timber.\n\n\n\n\n\n“A Death in the Desert”\n\nEverett Hilgarde was conscious that the man in the seat across the\naisle was looking at him intently. He was a large, florid man, wore a\nconspicuous diamond solitaire upon his third finger, and Everett judged\nhim to be a traveling salesman of some sort. He had the air of an\nadaptable fellow who had been about the world and who could keep cool\nand clean under almost any circumstances.\n\nThe “High Line Flyer,” as this train was derisively called among\nrailroad men, was jerking along through the hot afternoon over the\nmonotonous country between Holdridge and Cheyenne. Besides the blond\nman and himself the only occupants of the car were two dusty,\nbedraggled-looking girls who had been to the Exposition at Chicago,\nand who were earnestly discussing the cost of their first trip out of\nColorado. The four uncomfortable passengers were covered with a sediment\nof fine, yellow dust which clung to their hair and eyebrows like gold\npowder. It blew up in clouds from the bleak, lifeless country through\nwhich they passed, until they were one color with the sagebrush and\nsandhills. The gray-and-yellow desert was varied only by occasional\nruins of deserted towns, and the little red boxes of station houses,\nwhere the spindling trees and sickly vines in the bluegrass yards made\nlittle green reserves fenced off in that confusing wilderness of sand.\n\nAs the slanting rays of the sun beat in stronger and stronger through\nthe car windows, the blond gentleman asked the ladies' permission to\nremove his coat, and sat in his lavender striped shirt sleeves, with a\nblack silk handkerchief tucked carefully about his collar. He had seemed\ninterested in Everett since they had boarded the train at Holdridge, and\nkept glancing at him curiously and then looking reflectively out of\nthe window, as though he were trying to recall something. But wherever\nEverett went someone was almost sure to look at him with that curious\ninterest, and it had ceased to embarrass or annoy him. Presently the\nstranger, seeming satisfied with his observation, leaned back in his\nseat, half-closed his eyes, and began softly to whistle the “Spring\nSong” from _Proserpine_, the cantata that a dozen years before had made\nits young composer famous in a night. Everett had heard that air on\nguitars in Old Mexico, on mandolins at college glees, on cottage organs\nin New England hamlets, and only two weeks ago he had heard it played on\nsleighbells at a variety theater in Denver. There was literally no way\nof escaping his brother's precocity. Adriance could live on the other\nside of the Atlantic, where his youthful indiscretions were forgotten in\nhis mature achievements, but his brother had never been able to outrun\n_Proserpine_, and here he found it again in the Colorado sand hills. Not\nthat Everett was exactly ashamed of _Proserpine_; only a man of genius\ncould have written it, but it was the sort of thing that a man of genius\noutgrows as soon as he can.\n\nEverett unbent a trifle and smiled at his neighbor across the aisle.\nImmediately the large man rose and, coming over, dropped into the seat\nfacing Hilgarde, extending his card.\n\n“Dusty ride, isn't it? I don't mind it myself; I'm used to it. Born and\nbred in de briar patch, like Br'er Rabbit. I've been trying to place you\nfor a long time; I think I must have met you before.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Everett, taking the card; “my name is Hilgarde. You've\nprobably met my brother, Adriance; people often mistake me for him.”\n\nThe traveling man brought his hand down upon his knee with such\nvehemence that the solitaire blazed.\n\n“So I was right after all, and if you're not Adriance Hilgarde, you're\nhis double. I thought I couldn't be mistaken. Seen him? Well, I guess!\nI never missed one of his recitals at the Auditorium, and he played\nthe piano score of _Proserpine_ through to us once at the Chicago Press\nClub. I used to be on the _Commercial_ there before I began\nto travel for the publishing department of the concern. So you're\nHilgarde's brother, and here I've run into you at the jumping-off place.\nSounds like a newspaper yarn, doesn't it?”\n\nThe traveling man laughed and offered Everett a cigar, and plied him\nwith questions on the only subject that people ever seemed to care to\ntalk to Everett about. At length the salesman and the two girls alighted\nat a Colorado way station, and Everett went on to Cheyenne alone.\n\nThe train pulled into Cheyenne at nine o'clock, late by a matter of four\nhours or so; but no one seemed particularly concerned at its tardiness\nexcept the station agent, who grumbled at being kept in the office\novertime on a summer night. When Everett alighted from the train he\nwalked down the platform and stopped at the track crossing, uncertain as\nto what direction he should take to reach a hotel. A phaeton stood near\nthe crossing, and a woman held the reins. She was dressed in white, and\nher figure was clearly silhouetted against the cushions, though it was\ntoo dark to see her face. Everett had scarcely noticed her, when the\nswitch engine came puffing up from the opposite direction, and the\nheadlight threw a strong glare of light on his face. Suddenly the woman\nin the phaeton uttered a low cry and dropped the reins. Everett started\nforward and caught the horse's head, but the animal only lifted its\nears and whisked its tail in impatient surprise. The woman sat perfectly\nstill, her head sunk between her shoulders and her handkerchief pressed\nto her face. Another woman came out of the depot and hurried toward the\nphaeton, crying, “Katharine, dear, what is the matter?”\n\nEverett hesitated a moment in painful embarrassment, then lifted his\nhat and passed on. He was accustomed to sudden recognitions in the most\nimpossible places, especially by women, but this cry out of the night\nhad shaken him.\n\nWhile Everett was breakfasting the next morning, the headwaiter leaned\nover his chair to murmur that there was a gentleman waiting to see him\nin the parlor. Everett finished his coffee and went in the direction\nindicated, where he found his visitor restlessly pacing the floor. His\nwhole manner betrayed a high degree of agitation, though his physique\nwas not that of a man whose nerves lie near the surface. He was\nsomething below medium height, square-shouldered and solidly built. His\nthick, closely cut hair was beginning to show gray about the ears, and\nhis bronzed face was heavily lined. His square brown hands were\nlocked behind him, and he held his shoulders like a man conscious of\nresponsibilities; yet, as he turned to greet Everett, there was an\nincongruous diffidence in his address.\n\n“Good morning, Mr. Hilgarde,” he said, extending his hand; “I found your\nname on the hotel register. My name is Gaylord. I'm afraid my sister\nstartled you at the station last night, Mr. Hilgarde, and I've come\naround to apologize.”\n\n“Ah! The young lady in the phaeton? I'm sure I didn't know whether I\nhad anything to do with her alarm or not. If I did, it is I who owe the\napology.”\n\nThe man colored a little under the dark brown of his face.\n\n“Oh, it's nothing you could help, sir, I fully understand that. You see,\nmy sister used to be a pupil of your brother's, and it seems you favor\nhim; and when the switch engine threw a light on your face it startled\nher.”\n\nEverett wheeled about in his chair. “Oh! _Katharine_ Gaylord! Is it\npossible! Now it's you who have given me a turn. Why, I used to know her\nwhen I was a boy. What on earth--”\n\n“Is she doing here?” said Gaylord, grimly filling out the pause. “You've\ngot at the heart of the matter. You knew my sister had been in bad\nhealth for a long time?”\n\n“No, I had never heard a word of that. The last I knew of her she was\nsinging in London. My brother and I correspond infrequently and seldom\nget beyond family matters. I am deeply sorry to hear this. There are\nmore reasons why I am concerned than I can tell you.”\n\nThe lines in Charley Gaylord's brow relaxed a little.\n\n“What I'm trying to say, Mr. Hilgarde, is that she wants to see you. I\nhate to ask you, but she's so set on it. We live several miles out of\ntown, but my rig's below, and I can take you out anytime you can go.”\n\n“I can go now, and it will give me real pleasure to do so,” said\nEverett, quickly. “I'll get my hat and be with you in a moment.”\n\nWhen he came downstairs Everett found a cart at the door, and Charley\nGaylord drew a long sigh of relief as he gathered up the reins and\nsettled back into his own element.\n\n“You see, I think I'd better tell you something about my sister before\nyou see her, and I don't know just where to begin. She traveled\nin Europe with your brother and his wife, and sang at a lot of his\nconcerts; but I don't know just how much you know about her.”\n\n“Very little, except that my brother always thought her the most gifted\nof his pupils, and that when I knew her she was very young and very\nbeautiful and turned my head sadly for a while.”\n\nEverett saw that Gaylord's mind was quite engrossed by his grief. He was\nwrought up to the point where his reserve and sense of proportion had\nquite left him, and his trouble was the one vital thing in the world.\n“That's the whole thing,” he went on, flicking his horses with the whip.\n\n“She was a great woman, as you say, and she didn't come of a great\nfamily. She had to fight her own way from the first. She got to Chicago,\nand then to New York, and then to Europe, where she went up like\nlightning, and got a taste for it all; and now she's dying here like a\nrat in a hole, out of her own world, and she can't fall back into ours.\nWe've grown apart, some way--miles and miles apart--and I'm afraid she's\nfearfully unhappy.”\n\n“It's a very tragic story that you are telling me, Gaylord,” said\nEverett. They were well out into the country now, spinning along over\nthe dusty plains of red grass, with the ragged-blue outline of the\nmountains before them.\n\n“Tragic!” cried Gaylord, starting up in his seat, “my God, man, nobody\nwill ever know how tragic. It's a tragedy I live with and eat with and\nsleep with, until I've lost my grip on everything. You see she had made\na good bit of money, but she spent it all going to health resorts. It's\nher lungs, you know. I've got money enough to send her anywhere, but the\ndoctors all say it's no use. She hasn't the ghost of a chance. It's just\ngetting through the days now. I had no notion she was half so bad before\nshe came to me. She just wrote that she was all run down. Now that she's\nhere, I think she'd be happier anywhere under the sun, but she won't\nleave. She says it's easier to let go of life here, and that to go East\nwould be dying twice. There was a time when I was a brakeman with a run\nout of Bird City, Iowa, and she was a little thing I could carry on my\nshoulder, when I could get her everything on earth she wanted, and she\nhadn't a wish my $80 a month didn't cover; and now, when I've got a\nlittle property together, I can't buy her a night's sleep!”\n\nEverett saw that, whatever Charley Gaylord's present status in the world\nmight be, he had brought the brakeman's heart up the ladder with him,\nand the brakeman's frank avowal of sentiment. Presently Gaylord went on:\n\n“You can understand how she has outgrown her family. We're all a pretty\ncommon sort, railroaders from away back. My father was a conductor. He\ndied when we were kids. Maggie, my other sister, who lives with me, was\na telegraph operator here while I was getting my grip on things. We had\nno education to speak of. I have to hire a stenographer because I can't\nspell straight--the Almighty couldn't teach me to spell. The things that\nmake up life to Kate are all Greek to me, and there's scarcely a point\nwhere we touch any more, except in our recollections of the old times\nwhen we were all young and happy together, and Kate sang in a church\nchoir in Bird City. But I believe, Mr. Hilgarde, that if she can see\njust one person like you, who knows about the things and people she's\ninterested in, it will give her about the only comfort she can have\nnow.”\n\nThe reins slackened in Charley Gaylord's hand as they drew up before a\nshowily painted house with many gables and a round tower. “Here we are,”\n he said, turning to Everett, “and I guess we understand each other.”\n\nThey were met at the door by a thin, colorless woman, whom Gaylord\nintroduced as “my sister, Maggie.” She asked her brother to show Mr.\nHilgarde into the music room, where Katharine wished to see him alone.\n\nWhen Everett entered the music room he gave a little start of surprise,\nfeeling that he had stepped from the glaring Wyoming sunlight into some\nNew York studio that he had always known. He wondered which it was of\nthose countless studios, high up under the roofs, over banks and\nshops and wholesale houses, that this room resembled, and he looked\nincredulously out of the window at the gray plain that ended in the\ngreat upheaval of the Rockies.\n\nThe haunting air of familiarity about the room perplexed him. Was it\na copy of some particular studio he knew, or was it merely the studio\natmosphere that seemed so individual and poignantly reminiscent here\nin Wyoming? He sat down in a reading chair and looked keenly about him.\nSuddenly his eye fell upon a large photograph of his brother above the\npiano. Then it all became clear to him: this was veritably his brother's\nroom. If it were not an exact copy of one of the many studios that\nAdriance had fitted up in various parts of the world, wearying of them\nand leaving almost before the renovator's varnish had dried, it was at\nleast in the same tone. In every detail Adriance's taste was so manifest\nthat the room seemed to exhale his personality.\n\nAmong the photographs on the wall there was one of Katharine Gaylord,\ntaken in the days when Everett had known her, and when the flash of her\neye or the flutter of her skirt was enough to set his boyish heart in a\ntumult. Even now, he stood before the portrait with a certain degree\nof embarrassment. It was the face of a woman already old in her first\nyouth, thoroughly sophisticated and a trifle hard, and it told of\nwhat her brother had called her fight. The camaraderie of her frank,\nconfident eyes was qualified by the deep lines about her mouth and the\ncurve of the lips, which was both sad and cynical. Certainly she had\nmore good will than confidence toward the world, and the bravado of\nher smile could not conceal the shadow of an unrest that was almost\ndiscontent. The chief charm of the woman, as Everett had known her, lay\nin her superb figure and in her eyes, which possessed a warm, lifegiving\nquality like the sunlight; eyes which glowed with a sort of perpetual\n_salutat_ to the world. Her head, Everett remembered as peculiarly\nwell-shaped and proudly poised. There had been always a little of the\nimperatrix about her, and her pose in the photograph revived all his old\nimpressions of her unattachedness, of how absolutely and valiantly she\nstood alone.\n\nEverett was still standing before the picture, his hands behind him\nand his head inclined, when he heard the door open. A very tall woman\nadvanced toward him, holding out her hand. As she started to speak, she\ncoughed slightly; then, laughing, said, in a low, rich voice, a trifle\nhusky: “You see I make the traditional Camille entrance--with the cough.\nHow good of you to come, Mr. Hilgarde.”\n\nEverett was acutely conscious that while addressing him she was not\nlooking at him at all, and, as he assured her of his pleasure in coming,\nhe was glad to have an opportunity to collect himself. He had not\nreckoned upon the ravages of a long illness. The long, loose folds\nof her white gown had been especially designed to conceal the sharp\noutlines of her emaciated body, but the stamp of her disease was\nthere; simple and ugly and obtrusive, a pitiless fact that could not be\ndisguised or evaded. The splendid shoulders were stooped, there was a\nswaying unevenness in her gait, her arms seemed disproportionately\nlong, and her hands were transparently white and cold to the touch. The\nchanges in her face were less obvious; the proud carriage of the head,\nthe warm, clear eyes, even the delicate flush of color in her cheeks,\nall defiantly remained, though they were all in a lower key--older,\nsadder, softer.\n\nShe sat down upon the divan and began nervously to arrange the pillows.\n“I know I'm not an inspiring object to look upon, but you must be quite\nfrank and sensible about that and get used to it at once, for we've no\ntime to lose. And if I'm a trifle irritable you won't mind?--for I'm\nmore than usually nervous.”\n\n“Don't bother with me this morning, if you are tired,” urged Everett. “I\ncan come quite as well tomorrow.”\n\n“Gracious, no!” she protested, with a flash of that quick, keen humor\nthat he remembered as a part of her. “It's solitude that I'm tired to\ndeath of--solitude and the wrong kind of people. You see, the minister,\nnot content with reading the prayers for the sick, called on me this\nmorning. He happened to be riding by on his bicycle and felt it his\nduty to stop. Of course, he disapproves of my profession, and I think\nhe takes it for granted that I have a dark past. The funniest feature\nof his conversation is that he is always excusing my own vocation to\nme--condoning it, you know--and trying to patch up my peace with my\nconscience by suggesting possible noble uses for what he kindly calls my\ntalent.”\n\nEverett laughed. “Oh! I'm afraid I'm not the person to call after such\na serious gentleman--I can't sustain the situation. At my best I don't\nreach higher than low comedy. Have you decided to which one of the noble\nuses you will devote yourself?”\n\nKatharine lifted her hands in a gesture of renunciation and exclaimed:\n“I'm not equal to any of them, not even the least noble. I didn't study\nthat method.”\n\nShe laughed and went on nervously: “The parson's not so bad. His English\nnever offends me, and he has read Gibbon's _Decline and Fall_, all five\nvolumes, and that's something. Then, he has been to New York, and that's\na great deal. But how we are losing time! Do tell me about New York;\nCharley says you're just on from there. How does it look and taste and\nsmell just now? I think a whiff of the Jersey ferry would be as flagons\nof cod-liver oil to me. Who conspicuously walks the Rialto now, and what\ndoes he or she wear? Are the trees still green in Madison Square, or\nhave they grown brown and dusty? Does the chaste Diana on the Garden\nTheatre still keep her vestal vows through all the exasperating changes\nof weather? Who has your brother's old studio now, and what misguided\naspirants practice their scales in the rookeries about Carnegie Hall?\nWhat do people go to see at the theaters, and what do they eat and drink\nthere in the world nowadays? You see, I'm homesick for it all, from the\nBattery to Riverside. Oh, let me die in Harlem!” She was interrupted\nby a violent attack of coughing, and Everett, embarrassed by her\ndiscomfort, plunged into gossip about the professional people he had met\nin town during the summer and the musical outlook for the winter. He was\ndiagraming with his pencil, on the back of an old envelope he found in\nhis pocket, some new mechanical device to be used at the Metropolitan in\nthe production of the _Rheingold_, when he became conscious that she was\nlooking at him intently, and that he was talking to the four walls.\n\nKatharine was lying back among the pillows, watching him through\nhalf-closed eyes, as a painter looks at a picture. He finished his\nexplanation vaguely enough and put the envelope back in his pocket. As\nhe did so she said, quietly: “How wonderfully like Adriance you are!”\n and he felt as though a crisis of some sort had been met and tided over.\n\nHe laughed, looking up at her with a touch of pride in his eyes that\nmade them seem quite boyish. “Yes, isn't it absurd? It's almost as\nawkward as looking like Napoleon--but, after all, there are some\nadvantages. It has made some of his friends like me, and I hope it will\nmake you.”\n\nKatharine smiled and gave him a quick, meaning glance from under her\nlashes. “Oh, it did that long ago. What a haughty, reserved youth you\nwere then, and how you used to stare at people and then blush and look\ncross if they paid you back in your own coin. Do you remember that night\nwhen you took me home from a rehearsal and scarcely spoke a word to me?”\n\n“It was the silence of admiration,” protested Everett, “very crude and\nboyish, but very sincere and not a little painful. Perhaps you suspected\nsomething of the sort? I remember you saw fit to be very grown-up and\nworldly.\n\n“I believe I suspected a pose; the one that college boys usually affect\nwith singers--'an earthen vessel in love with a star,' you know. But it\nrather surprised me in you, for you must have seen a good deal of your\nbrother's pupils. Or had you an omnivorous capacity, and elasticity that\nalways met the occasion?”\n\n“Don't ask a man to confess the follies of his youth,” said Everett,\nsmiling a little sadly; “I am sensitive about some of them even now. But\nI was not so sophisticated as you imagined. I saw my brother's pupils\ncome and go, but that was about all. Sometimes I was called on to play\naccompaniments, or to fill out a vacancy at a rehearsal, or to order a\ncarriage for an infuriated soprano who had thrown up her part. But they\nnever spent any time on me, unless it was to notice the resemblance you\nspeak of.”\n\n“Yes”, observed Katharine, thoughtfully, “I noticed it then, too; but it\nhas grown as you have grown older. That is rather strange, when you have\nlived such different lives. It's not merely an ordinary family likeness\nof feature, you know, but a sort of interchangeable individuality;\nthe suggestion of the other man's personality in your face like an air\ntransposed to another key. But I'm not attempting to define it; it's\nbeyond me; something altogether unusual and a trifle--well, uncanny,”\n she finished, laughing.\n\n“I remember,” Everett said seriously, twirling the pencil between his\nfingers and looking, as he sat with his head thrown back, out under the\nred window blind which was raised just a little, and as it swung back\nand forth in the wind revealed the glaring panorama of the desert--a\nblinding stretch of yellow, flat as the sea in dead calm, splotched here\nand there with deep purple shadows; and, beyond, the ragged-blue outline\nof the mountains and the peaks of snow, white as the white clouds--“I\nremember, when I was a little fellow I used to be very sensitive about\nit. I don't think it exactly displeased me, or that I would have had it\notherwise if I could, but it seemed to me like a birthmark, or something\nnot to be lightly spoken of. People were naturally always fonder of\nAd than of me, and I used to feel the chill of reflected light pretty\noften. It came into even my relations with my mother. Ad went abroad to\nstudy when he was absurdly young, you know, and mother was all broken\nup over it. She did her whole duty by each of us, but it was sort of\ngenerally understood among us that she'd have made burnt offerings of us\nall for Ad any day. I was a little fellow then, and when she sat alone\non the porch in the summer dusk she used sometimes to call me to her and\nturn my face up in the light that streamed out through the shutters and\nkiss me, and then I always knew she was thinking of Adriance.”\n\n“Poor little chap,” said Katharine, and her tone was a trifle huskier\nthan usual. “How fond people have always been of Adriance! Now tell me\nthe latest news of him. I haven't heard, except through the press, for\na year or more. He was in Algeria then, in the valley of the Chelif,\nriding horseback night and day in an Arabian costume, and in his\nusual enthusiastic fashion he had quite made up his mind to adopt the\nMohammedan faith and become as nearly an Arab as possible. How many\ncountries and faiths has he adopted, I wonder? Probably he was playing\nArab to himself all the time. I remember he was a sixteenth-century duke\nin Florence once for weeks together.”\n\n“Oh, that's Adriance,” chuckled Everett. “He is himself barely long\nenough to write checks and be measured for his clothes. I didn't hear\nfrom him while he was an Arab; I missed that.”\n\n“He was writing an Algerian suite for the piano then; it must be in\nthe publisher's hands by this time. I have been too ill to answer his\nletter, and have lost touch with him.”\n\nEverett drew a letter from his pocket. “This came about a month ago.\nIt's chiefly about his new opera, which is to be brought out in London\nnext winter. Read it at your leisure.”\n\n“I think I shall keep it as a hostage, so that I may be sure you will\ncome again. Now I want you to play for me. Whatever you like; but if\nthere is anything new in the world, in mercy let me hear it. For nine\nmonths I have heard nothing but 'The Baggage Coach Ahead' and 'She Is My\nBaby's Mother.'”\n\nHe sat down at the piano, and Katharine sat near him, absorbed in his\nremarkable physical likeness to his brother and trying to discover in\njust what it consisted. She told herself that it was very much as though\na sculptor's finished work had been rudely copied in wood. He was of\na larger build than Adriance, and his shoulders were broad and heavy,\nwhile those of his brother were slender and rather girlish. His face was\nof the same oval mold, but it was gray and darkened about the mouth by\ncontinual shaving. His eyes were of the same inconstant April color,\nbut they were reflective and rather dull; while Adriance's were always\npoints of highlight, and always meaning another thing than the thing\nthey meant yesterday. But it was hard to see why this earnest man should\nso continually suggest that lyric, youthful face that was as gay as his\nwas grave. For Adriance, though he was ten years the elder, and though\nhis hair was streaked with silver, had the face of a boy of twenty, so\nmobile that it told his thoughts before he could put them into words. A\ncontralto, famous for the extravagance of her vocal methods and of her\naffections, had once said to him that the shepherd boys who sang in the\nVale of Tempe must certainly have looked like young Hilgarde; and the\ncomparison had been appropriated by a hundred shyer women who preferred\nto quote.\n\n\nAs Everett sat smoking on the veranda of the Inter-Ocean House that\nnight, he was a victim to random recollections. His infatuation for\nKatharine Gaylord, visionary as it was, had been the most serious of his\nboyish love affairs, and had long disturbed his bachelor dreams. He was\npainfully timid in everything relating to the emotions, and his hurt\nhad withdrawn him from the society of women. The fact that it was all so\ndone and dead and far behind him, and that the woman had lived her\nlife out since then, gave him an oppressive sense of age and loss. He\nbethought himself of something he had read about “sitting by the hearth\nand remembering the faces of women without desire,” and felt himself an\noctogenarian.\n\nHe remembered how bitter and morose he had grown during his stay at his\nbrother's studio when Katharine Gaylord was working there, and how he\nhad wounded Adriance on the night of his last concert in New York. He\nhad sat there in the box while his brother and Katharine were called\nback again and again after the last number, watching the roses go up\nover the footlights until they were stacked half as high as the piano,\nbrooding, in his sullen boy's heart, upon the pride those two felt in\neach other's work--spurring each other to their best and beautifully\ncontending in song. The footlights had seemed a hard, glittering line\ndrawn sharply between their life and his; a circle of flame set about\nthose splendid children of genius. He walked back to his hotel alone\nand sat in his window staring out on Madison Square until long after\nmidnight, resolving to beat no more at doors that he could never enter\nand realizing more keenly than ever before how far this glorious world\nof beautiful creations lay from the paths of men like himself. He told\nhimself that he had in common with this woman only the baser uses of\nlife.\n\nEverett's week in Cheyenne stretched to three, and he saw no prospect of\nrelease except through the thing he dreaded. The bright, windy days of\nthe Wyoming autumn passed swiftly. Letters and telegrams came urging\nhim to hasten his trip to the coast, but he resolutely postponed his\nbusiness engagements. The mornings he spent on one of Charley Gaylord's\nponies, or fishing in the mountains, and in the evenings he sat in his\nroom writing letters or reading. In the afternoon he was usually at his\npost of duty. Destiny, he reflected, seems to have very positive notions\nabout the sort of parts we are fitted to play. The scene changes and the\ncompensation varies, but in the end we usually find that we have played\nthe same class of business from first to last. Everett had been a\nstopgap all his life. He remembered going through a looking glass\nlabyrinth when he was a boy and trying gallery after gallery, only at\nevery turn to bump his nose against his own face--which, indeed, was not\nhis own, but his brother's. No matter what his mission, east or west,\nby land or sea, he was sure to find himself employed in his brother's\nbusiness, one of the tributary lives which helped to swell the shining\ncurrent of Adriance Hilgarde's. It was not the first time that his duty\nhad been to comfort, as best he could, one of the broken things his\nbrother's imperious speed had cast aside and forgotten. He made no\nattempt to analyze the situation or to state it in exact terms; but\nhe felt Katharine Gaylord's need for him, and he accepted it as a\ncommission from his brother to help this woman to die. Day by day he\nfelt her demands on him grow more imperious, her need for him grow more\nacute and positive; and day by day he felt that in his peculiar relation\nto her his own individuality played a smaller and smaller part. His\npower to minister to her comfort, he saw, lay solely in his link with\nhis brother's life. He understood all that his physical resemblance\nmeant to her. He knew that she sat by him always watching for some\ncommon trick of gesture, some familiar play of expression, some illusion\nof light and shadow, in which he should seem wholly Adriance. He knew\nthat she lived upon this and that her disease fed upon it; that it sent\nshudders of remembrance through her and that in the exhaustion which\nfollowed this turmoil of her dying senses, she slept deep and sweet and\ndreamed of youth and art and days in a certain old Florentine garden,\nand not of bitterness and death.\n\nThe question which most perplexed him was, “How much shall I know? How\nmuch does she wish me to know?” A few days after his first meeting with\nKatharine Gaylord, he had cabled his brother to write her. He had merely\nsaid that she was mortally ill; he could depend on Adriance to say the\nright thing--that was a part of his gift. Adriance always said not\nonly the right thing, but the opportune, graceful, exquisite thing. His\nphrases took the color of the moment and the then-present condition, so\nthat they never savored of perfunctory compliment or frequent usage. He\nalways caught the lyric essence of the moment, the poetic suggestion\nof every situation. Moreover, he usually did the right thing, the\nopportune, graceful, exquisite thing--except, when he did very cruel\nthings--bent upon making people happy when their existence touched his,\njust as he insisted that his material environment should be beautiful;\nlavishing upon those near him all the warmth and radiance of his rich\nnature, all the homage of the poet and troubadour, and, when they were\nno longer near, forgetting--for that also was a part of Adriance's gift.\n\nThree weeks after Everett had sent his cable, when he made his daily\ncall at the gaily painted ranch house, he found Katharine laughing like\na schoolgirl. “Have you ever thought,” she said, as he entered the\nmusic room, “how much these seances of ours are like Heine's 'Florentine\nNights,' except that I don't give you an opportunity to monopolize the\nconversation as Heine did?” She held his hand longer than usual, as\nshe greeted him, and looked searchingly up into his face. “You are the\nkindest man living; the kindest,” she added, softly.\n\nEverett's gray face colored faintly as he drew his hand away, for\nhe felt that this time she was looking at him and not at a whimsical\ncaricature of his brother. “Why, what have I done now?” he asked,\nlamely. “I can't remember having sent you any stale candy or champagne\nsince yesterday.”\n\nShe drew a letter with a foreign postmark from between the leaves of a\nbook and held it out, smiling. “You got him to write it. Don't say you\ndidn't, for it came direct, you see, and the last address I gave him was\na place in Florida. This deed shall be remembered of you when I am with\nthe just in Paradise. But one thing you did not ask him to do, for you\ndidn't know about it. He has sent me his latest work, the new sonata,\nthe most ambitious thing he has ever done, and you are to play it for me\ndirectly, though it looks horribly intricate. But first for the letter;\nI think you would better read it aloud to me.”\n\nEverett sat down in a low chair facing the window seat in which she\nreclined with a barricade of pillows behind her. He opened the letter,\nhis lashes half-veiling his kind eyes, and saw to his satisfaction that\nit was a long one--wonderfully tactful and tender, even for Adriance,\nwho was tender with his valet and his stable boy, with his old gondolier\nand the beggar-women who prayed to the saints for him.\n\nThe letter was from Granada, written in the Alhambra, as he sat by the\nfountain of the Patio di Lindaraxa. The air was heavy, with the warm\nfragrance of the South and full of the sound of splashing, running\nwater, as it had been in a certain old garden in Florence, long ago.\nThe sky was one great turquoise, heated until it glowed. The wonderful\nMoorish arches threw graceful blue shadows all about him. He had\nsketched an outline of them on the margin of his notepaper. The\nsubtleties of Arabic decoration had cast an unholy spell over him,\nand the brutal exaggerations of Gothic art were a bad dream, easily\nforgotten. The Alhambra itself had, from the first, seemed perfectly\nfamiliar to him, and he knew that he must have trod that court,\nsleek and brown and obsequious, centuries before Ferdinand rode into\nAndalusia. The letter was full of confidences about his work, and\ndelicate allusions to their old happy days of study and comradeship, and\nof her own work, still so warmly remembered and appreciatively discussed\neverywhere he went.\n\nAs Everett folded the letter he felt that Adriance had divined the thing\nneeded and had risen to it in his own wonderful way. The letter was\nconsistently egotistical and seemed to him even a trifle patronizing,\nyet it was just what she had wanted. A strong realization of his\nbrother's charm and intensity and power came over him; he felt the\nbreath of that whirlwind of flame in which Adriance passed, consuming\nall in his path, and himself even more resolutely than he consumed\nothers. Then he looked down at this white, burnt-out brand that lay\nbefore him. “Like him, isn't it?” she said, quietly.\n\n“I think I can scarcely answer his letter, but when you see him next you\ncan do that for me. I want you to tell him many things for me, yet they\ncan all be summed up in this: I want him to grow wholly into his best\nand greatest self, even at the cost of the dear boyishness that is half\nhis charm to you and me. Do you understand me?”\n\n“I know perfectly well what you mean,” answered Everett, thoughtfully.\n“I have often felt so about him myself. And yet it's difficult to\nprescribe for those fellows; so little makes, so little mars.”\n\nKatharine raised herself upon her elbow, and her face flushed with\nfeverish earnestness. “Ah, but it is the waste of himself that I mean;\nhis lashing himself out on stupid and uncomprehending people until they\ntake him at their own estimate. He can kindle marble, strike fire from\nputty, but is it worth what it costs him?”\n\n“Come, come,” expostulated Everett, alarmed at her excitement. “Where is\nthe new sonata? Let him speak for himself.”\n\nHe sat down at the piano and began playing the first movement, which was\nindeed the voice of Adriance, his proper speech. The sonata was the most\nambitious work he had done up to that time and marked the transition\nfrom his purely lyric vein to a deeper and nobler style. Everett played\nintelligently and with that sympathetic comprehension which seems\npeculiar to a certain lovable class of men who never accomplish anything\nin particular. When he had finished he turned to Katharine.\n\n“How he has grown!” she cried. “What the three last years have done for\nhim! He used to write only the tragedies of passion; but this is the\ntragedy of the soul, the shadow coexistent with the soul. This is the\ntragedy of effort and failure, the thing Keats called hell. This is my\ntragedy, as I lie here spent by the racecourse, listening to the feet of\nthe runners as they pass me. Ah, God! The swift feet of the runners!”\n\nShe turned her face away and covered it with her straining hands.\nEverett crossed over to her quickly and knelt beside her. In all\nthe days he had known her she had never before, beyond an occasional\nironical jest, given voice to the bitterness of her own defeat. Her\ncourage had become a point of pride with him, and to see it going\nsickened him.\n\n“Don't do it,” he gasped. “I can't stand it, I really can't, I feel it\ntoo much. We mustn't speak of that; it's too tragic and too vast.”\n\nWhen she turned her face back to him there was a ghost of the old,\nbrave, cynical smile on it, more bitter than the tears she could not\nshed. “No, I won't be so ungenerous; I will save that for the watches\nof the night when I have no better company. Now you may mix me another\ndrink of some sort. Formerly, when it was not _if_ I should ever sing\nBrunnhilde, but quite simply when I _should_ sing Brunnhilde, I was\nalways starving myself and thinking what I might drink and what I might\nnot. But broken music boxes may drink whatsoever they list, and no\none cares whether they lose their figure. Run over that theme at the\nbeginning again. That, at least, is not new. It was running in his head\nwhen we were in Venice years ago, and he used to drum it on his glass at\nthe dinner table. He had just begun to work it out when the late autumn\ncame on, and the paleness of the Adriatic oppressed him, and he decided\nto go to Florence for the winter, and lost touch with the theme during\nhis illness. Do you remember those frightful days? All the people who\nhave loved him are not strong enough to save him from himself! When\nI got word from Florence that he had been ill I was in Nice filling\na concert engagement. His wife was hurrying to him from Paris, but I\nreached him first. I arrived at dusk, in a terrific storm. They had\ntaken an old palace there for the winter, and I found him in the\nlibrary--a long, dark room full of old Latin books and heavy furniture\nand bronzes. He was sitting by a wood fire at one end of the room,\nlooking, oh, so worn and pale!--as he always does when he is ill, you\nknow. Ah, it is so good that you _do_ know! Even his red smoking jacket\nlent no color to his face. His first words were not to tell me how ill\nhe had been, but that that morning he had been well enough to put the\nlast strokes to the score of his _Souvenirs d'Automne_. He was as I\nmost like to remember him: so calm and happy and tired; not gay, as he\nusually is, but just contented and tired with that heavenly tiredness\nthat comes after a good work done at last. Outside, the rain poured\ndown in torrents, and the wind moaned for the pain of all the world and\nsobbed in the branches of the shivering olives and about the walls of\nthat desolated old palace. How that night comes back to me! There were\nno lights in the room, only the wood fire which glowed upon the hard\nfeatures of the bronze Dante, like the reflection of purgatorial flames,\nand threw long black shadows about us; beyond us it scarcely penetrated\nthe gloom at all, Adriance sat staring at the fire with the weariness\nof all his life in his eyes, and of all the other lives that must aspire\nand suffer to make up one such life as his. Somehow the wind with all\nits world-pain had got into the room, and the cold rain was in our eyes,\nand the wave came up in both of us at once--that awful, vague, universal\npain, that cold fear of life and death and God and hope--and we were\nlike two clinging together on a spar in midocean after the shipwreck of\neverything. Then we heard the front door open with a great gust of wind\nthat shook even the walls, and the servants came running with lights,\nannouncing that Madam had returned, _'and in the book we read no more\nthat night.'_”\n\nShe gave the old line with a certain bitter humor, and with the hard,\nbright smile in which of old she had wrapped her weakness as in a\nglittering garment. That ironical smile, worn like a mask through so\nmany years, had gradually changed even the lines of her face completely,\nand when she looked in the mirror she saw not herself, but the scathing\ncritic, the amused observer and satirist of herself. Everett dropped\nhis head upon his hand and sat looking at the rug. “How much you have\ncared!” he said.\n\n“Ah, yes, I cared,” she replied, closing her eyes with a long-drawn sigh\nof relief; and lying perfectly still, she went on: “You can't imagine\nwhat a comfort it is to have you know how I cared, what a relief it is\nto be able to tell it to someone. I used to want to shriek it out to the\nworld in the long nights when I could not sleep. It seemed to me that I\ncould not die with it. It demanded some sort of expression. And now that\nyou know, you would scarcely believe how much less sharp the anguish of\nit is.”\n\nEverett continued to look helplessly at the floor. “I was not sure how\nmuch you wanted me to know,” he said.\n\n“Oh, I intended you should know from the first time I looked into your\nface, when you came that day with Charley. I flatter myself that I have\nbeen able to conceal it when I chose, though I suppose women always\nthink that. The more observing ones may have seen, but discerning people\nare usually discreet and often kind, for we usually bleed a little\nbefore we begin to discern. But I wanted you to know; you are so like\nhim that it is almost like telling him himself. At least, I feel now\nthat he will know some day, and then I will be quite sacred from his\ncompassion, for we none of us dare pity the dead. Since it was what my\nlife has chiefly meant, I should like him to know. On the whole I am not\nashamed of it. I have fought a good fight.”\n\n“And has he never known at all?” asked Everett, in a thick voice.\n\n“Oh! Never at all in the way that you mean. Of course, he is accustomed\nto looking into the eyes of women and finding love there; when he\ndoesn't find it there he thinks he must have been guilty of some\ndiscourtesy and is miserable about it. He has a genuine fondness for\neveryone who is not stupid or gloomy, or old or preternaturally ugly.\nGranted youth and cheerfulness, and a moderate amount of wit and some\ntact, and Adriance will always be glad to see you coming around the\ncorner. I shared with the rest; shared the smiles and the gallantries\nand the droll little sermons. It was quite like a Sunday-school picnic;\nwe wore our best clothes and a smile and took our turns. It was his\nkindness that was hardest. I have pretty well used my life up at\nstanding punishment.”\n\n“Don't; you'll make me hate him,” groaned Everett.\n\nKatharine laughed and began to play nervously with her fan. “It wasn't\nin the slightest degree his fault; that is the most grotesque part of\nit. Why, it had really begun before I ever met him. I fought my way to\nhim, and I drank my doom greedily enough.”\n\nEverett rose and stood hesitating. “I think I must go. You ought to be\nquiet, and I don't think I can hear any more just now.”\n\nShe put out her hand and took his playfully. “You've put in three weeks\nat this sort of thing, haven't you? Well, it may never be to your glory\nin this world, perhaps, but it's been the mercy of heaven to me, and it\nought to square accounts for a much worse life than yours will ever be.”\n\nEverett knelt beside her, saying, brokenly: “I stayed because I wanted\nto be with you, that's all. I have never cared about other women since I\nmet you in New York when I was a lad. You are a part of my destiny, and\nI could not leave you if I would.”\n\nShe put her hands on his shoulders and shook her head. “No, no; don't\ntell me that. I have seen enough of tragedy, God knows. Don't show me\nany more just as the curtain is going down. No, no, it was only a boy's\nfancy, and your divine pity and my utter pitiableness have recalled it\nfor a moment. One does not love the dying, dear friend. If some fancy of\nthat sort had been left over from boyhood, this would rid you of it,\nand that were well. Now go, and you will come again tomorrow, as long as\nthere are tomorrows, will you not?” She took his hand with a smile that\nlifted the mask from her soul, that was both courage and despair, and\nfull of infinite loyalty and tenderness, as she said softly:\n\n     For ever and for ever, farewell, Cassius;\n     If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;\n     If not, why then, this parting was well made.\n\nThe courage in her eyes was like the clear light of a star to him as he\nwent out.\n\nOn the night of Adriance Hilgarde's opening concert in Paris Everett sat\nby the bed in the ranch house in Wyoming, watching over the last battle\nthat we have with the flesh before we are done with it and free of it\nforever. At times it seemed that the serene soul of her must have left\nalready and found some refuge from the storm, and only the tenacious\nanimal life were left to do battle with death. She labored under a\ndelusion at once pitiful and merciful, thinking that she was in the\nPullman on her way to New York, going back to her life and her work.\nWhen she aroused from her stupor it was only to ask the porter to waken\nher half an hour out of Jersey City, or to remonstrate with him about\nthe delays and the roughness of the road. At midnight Everett and the\nnurse were left alone with her. Poor Charley Gaylord had lain down on a\ncouch outside the door. Everett sat looking at the sputtering night lamp\nuntil it made his eyes ache. His head dropped forward on the foot of the\nbed, and he sank into a heavy, distressful slumber. He was dreaming of\nAdriance's concert in Paris, and of Adriance, the troubadour, smiling\nand debonair, with his boyish face and the touch of silver gray in\nhis hair. He heard the applause and he saw the roses going up over the\nfootlights until they were stacked half as high as the piano, and the\npetals fell and scattered, making crimson splotches on the floor. Down\nthis crimson pathway came Adriance with his youthful step, leading his\nprima donna by the hand; a dark woman this time, with Spanish eyes.\n\nThe nurse touched him on the shoulder; he started and awoke. She\nscreened the lamp with her hand. Everett saw that Katharine was awake\nand conscious, and struggling a little. He lifted her gently on his arm\nand began to fan her. She laid her hands lightly on his hair and looked\ninto his face with eyes that seemed never to have wept or doubted. “Ah,\ndear Adriance, dear, dear,” she whispered.\n\nEverett went to call her brother, but when they came back the madness of\nart was over for Katharine.\n\nTwo days later Everett was pacing the station siding, waiting for the\nwestbound train. Charley Gaylord walked beside him, but the two men had\nnothing to say to each other. Everett's bags were piled on the truck,\nand his step was hurried and his eyes were full of impatience, as he\ngazed again and again up the track, watching for the train. Gaylord's\nimpatience was not less than his own; these two, who had grown so close,\nhad now become painful and impossible to each other, and longed for the\nwrench of farewell.\n\nAs the train pulled in Everett wrung Gaylord's hand among the crowd of\nalighting passengers. The people of a German opera company, en route\nto the coast, rushed by them in frantic haste to snatch their breakfast\nduring the stop. Everett heard an exclamation in a broad German dialect,\nand a massive woman whose figure persistently escaped from her stays in\nthe most improbable places rushed up to him, her blond hair disordered\nby the wind, and glowing with joyful surprise she caught his coat sleeve\nwith her tightly gloved hands.\n\n“_Herr Gott_, Adriance, _lieber Freund_,” she cried, emotionally.\n\nEverett quickly withdrew his arm and lifted his hat, blushing. “Pardon\nme, madam, but I see that you have mistaken me for Adriance Hilgarde.\nI am his brother,” he said quietly, and turning from the crestfallen\nsinger, he hurried into the car.\n\n\n\n\nThe Garden Lodge\n\nWhen Caroline Noble's friends learned that Raymond d'Esquerre was to\nspend a month at her place on the Sound before he sailed to fill his\nengagement for the London opera season, they considered it another\nstriking instance of the perversity of things. That the month was May,\nand the most mild and florescent of all the blue-and-white Mays the\nmiddle coast had known in years, but added to their sense of wrong.\nD'Esquerre, they learned, was ensconced in the lodge in the apple\norchard, just beyond Caroline's glorious garden, and report went that\nat almost any hour the sound of the tenor's voice and of Caroline's\ncrashing accompaniment could be heard floating through the open windows,\nout among the snowy apple boughs. The Sound, steel-blue and dotted with\nwhite sails, was splendidly seen from the windows of the lodge. The\ngarden to the left and the orchard to the right had never been so\nriotous with spring, and had burst into impassioned bloom, as if to\naccommodate Caroline, though she was certainly the last woman to whom\nthe witchery of Freya could be attributed; the last woman, as her\nfriends affirmed, to at all adequately appreciate and make the most of\nsuch a setting for the great tenor.\n\nOf course, they admitted, Caroline was musical--well, she ought to\nbe!--but in that, as in everything, she was paramountly cool-headed,\nslow of impulse, and disgustingly practical; in that, as in everything\nelse, she had herself so provokingly well in hand. Of course, it would\nbe she, always mistress of herself in any situation, she, who would\nnever be lifted one inch from the ground by it, and who would go on\nsuperintending her gardeners and workmen as usual--it would be she who\ngot him. Perhaps some of them suspected that this was exactly why she\ndid get him, and it but nettled them the more.\n\nCaroline's coolness, her capableness, her general success, especially\nexasperated people because they felt that, for the most part, she\nhad made herself what she was; that she had cold-bloodedly set about\ncomplying with the demands of life and making her position comfortable\nand masterful. That was why, everyone said, she had married Howard\nNoble. Women who did not get through life so well as Caroline, who could\nnot make such good terms either with fortune or their husbands, who did\nnot find their health so unfailingly good, or hold their looks so well,\nor manage their children so easily, or give such distinction to all they\ndid, were fond of stamping Caroline as a materialist, and called her\nhard.\n\nThe impression of cold calculation, of having a definite policy, which\nCaroline gave, was far from a false one; but there was this to be said\nfor her--that there were extenuating circumstances which her friends\ncould not know.\n\nIf Caroline held determinedly to the middle course, if she was apt to\nregard with distrust everything which inclined toward extravagance, it\nwas not because she was unacquainted with other standards than her own,\nor had never seen another side of life. She had grown up in Brooklyn,\nin a shabby little house under the vacillating administration of her\nfather, a music teacher who usually neglected his duties to write\norchestral compositions for which the world seemed to have no especial\nneed. His spirit was warped by bitter vindictiveness and puerile\nself-commiseration, and he spent his days in scorn of the labor that\nbrought him bread and in pitiful devotion to the labor that brought him\nonly disappointment, writing interminable scores which demanded of the\norchestra everything under heaven except melody.\n\nIt was not a cheerful home for a girl to grow up in. The mother, who\nidolized her husband as the music lord of the future, was left to a\nlifelong battle with broom and dustpan, to neverending conciliatory\novertures to the butcher and grocer, to the making of her own gowns\nand of Caroline's, and to the delicate task of mollifying Auguste's\nneglected pupils.\n\nThe son, Heinrich, a painter, Caroline's only brother, had inherited all\nhis father's vindictive sensitiveness without his capacity for slavish\napplication. His little studio on the third floor had been much\nfrequented by young men as unsuccessful as himself, who met there to\ngive themselves over to contemptuous derision of this or that artist\nwhose industry and stupidity had won him recognition. Heinrich, when he\nworked at all, did newspaper sketches at twenty-five dollars a week. He\nwas too indolent and vacillating to set himself seriously to his art,\ntoo irascible and poignantly self-conscious to make a living, too much\naddicted to lying late in bed, to the incontinent reading of poetry, and\nto the use of chloral to be anything very positive except painful. At\ntwenty-six he shot himself in a frenzy, and the whole wretched affair\nhad effectually shattered his mother's health and brought on the decline\nof which she died. Caroline had been fond of him, but she felt a certain\nrelief when he no longer wandered about the little house, commenting\nironically upon its shabbiness, a Turkish cap on his head and a\ncigarette hanging from between his long, tremulous fingers.\n\nAfter her mother's death Caroline assumed the management of that\nbankrupt establishment. The funeral expenses were unpaid, and Auguste's\npupils had been frightened away by the shock of successive disasters and\nthe general atmosphere of wretchedness that pervaded the house. Auguste\nhimself was writing a symphonic poem, Icarus, dedicated to the memory\nof his son. Caroline was barely twenty when she was called upon to face\nthis tangle of difficulties, but she reviewed the situation candidly.\nThe house had served its time at the shrine of idealism; vague,\ndistressing, unsatisfied yearnings had brought it low enough. Her\nmother, thirty years before, had eloped and left Germany with her music\nteacher, to give herself over to lifelong, drudging bondage at the\nkitchen range. Ever since Caroline could remember, the law in the house\nhad been a sort of mystic worship of things distant, intangible and\nunattainable. The family had lived in successive ebullitions of generous\nenthusiasm, in talk of masters and masterpieces, only to come down to\nthe cold facts in the case; to boiled mutton and to the necessity of\nturning the dining-room carpet. All these emotional pyrotechnics had\nended in petty jealousies, in neglected duties, and in cowardly fear of\nthe little grocer on the corner.\n\nFrom her childhood she had hated it, that humiliating and uncertain\nexistence, with its glib tongue and empty pockets, its poetic ideals and\nsordid realities, its indolence and poverty tricked out in paper roses.\nEven as a little girl, when vague dreams beset her, when she wanted to\nlie late in bed and commune with visions, or to leap and sing because\nthe sooty little trees along the street were putting out their first\npale leaves in the sunshine, she would clench her hands and go to\nhelp her mother sponge the spots from her father's waistcoat or press\nHeinrich's trousers. Her mother never permitted the slightest question\nconcerning anything Auguste or Heinrich saw fit to do, but from the\ntime Caroline could reason at all she could not help thinking that many\nthings went wrong at home. She knew, for example, that her father's\npupils ought not to be kept waiting half an hour while he discussed\nSchopenhauer with some bearded socialist over a dish of herrings and a\nspotted tablecloth. She knew that Heinrich ought not to give a dinner on\nHeine's birthday, when the laundress had not been paid for a month and\nwhen he frequently had to ask his mother for carfare. Certainly Caroline\nhad served her apprenticeship to idealism and to all the embarrassing\ninconsistencies which it sometimes entails, and she decided to deny\nherself this diffuse, ineffectual answer to the sharp questions of life.\n\nWhen she came into the control of herself and the house she refused\nto proceed any further with her musical education. Her father, who had\nintended to make a concert pianist of her, set this down as another\nitem in his long list of disappointments and his grievances against\nthe world. She was young and pretty, and she had worn turned gowns and\nsoiled gloves and improvised hats all her life. She wanted the luxury of\nbeing like other people, of being honest from her hat to her boots, of\nhaving nothing to hide, not even in the matter of stockings, and she was\nwilling to work for it. She rented a little studio away from that house\nof misfortune and began to give lessons. She managed well and was the\nsort of girl people liked to help. The bills were paid and Auguste went\non composing, growing indignant only when she refused to insist that\nher pupils should study his compositions for the piano. She began to\nget engagements in New York to play accompaniments at song recitals.\nShe dressed well, made herself agreeable, and gave herself a chance.\nShe never permitted herself to look further than a step ahead, and set\nherself with all the strength of her will to see things as they are and\nmeet them squarely in the broad day. There were two things she feared\neven more than poverty: the part of one that sets up an idol and the\npart of one that bows down and worships it.\n\nWhen Caroline was twenty-four she married Howard Noble, then a widower\nof forty, who had been for ten years a power in Wall Street. Then, for\nthe first time, she had paused to take breath. It took a substantialness\nas unquestionable as his; his money, his position, his energy, the big\nvigor of his robust person, to satisfy her that she was entirely safe.\nThen she relaxed a little, feeling that there was a barrier to be\ncounted upon between her and that world of visions and quagmires and\nfailure.\n\nCaroline had been married for six years when Raymond d'Esquerre came\nto stay with them. He came chiefly because Caroline was what she was;\nbecause he, too, felt occasionally the need of getting out of Klingsor's\ngarden, of dropping down somewhere for a time near a quiet nature, a\ncool head, a strong hand. The hours he had spent in the garden lodge\nwere hours of such concentrated study as, in his fevered life, he seldom\ngot in anywhere. She had, as he told Noble, a fine appreciation of the\nseriousness of work.\n\nOne evening two weeks after d'Esquerre had sailed, Caroline was in the\nlibrary giving her husband an account of the work she had laid out for\nthe gardeners. She superintended the care of the grounds herself. Her\ngarden, indeed, had become quite a part of her; a sort of beautiful\nadjunct, like gowns or jewels. It was a famous spot, and Noble was very\nproud of it.\n\n“What do you think, Caroline, of having the garden lodge torn down and\nputting a new summer house there at the end of the arbor; a big rustic\naffair where you could have tea served in midsummer?” he asked.\n\n“The lodge?” repeated Caroline looking at him quickly. “Why, that seems\nalmost a shame, doesn't it, after d'Esquerre has used it?”\n\nNoble put down his book with a smile of amusement.\n\n“Are you going to be sentimental about it? Why, I'd sacrifice the whole\nplace to see that come to pass. But I don't believe you could do it for\nan hour together.”\n\n“I don't believe so, either,” said his wife, smiling.\n\nNoble took up his book again and Caroline went into the music room to\npractice. She was not ready to have the lodge torn down. She had gone\nthere for a quiet hour every day during the two weeks since d'Esquerre\nhad left them. It was the sheerest sentiment she had ever permitted\nherself. She was ashamed of it, but she was childishly unwilling to let\nit go.\n\nCaroline went to bed soon after her husband, but she was not able to\nsleep. The night was close and warm, presaging storm. The wind had\nfallen, and the water slept, fixed and motionless as the sand. She rose\nand thrust her feet into slippers and, putting a dressing gown over\nher shoulders, opened the door of her husband's room; he was sleeping\nsoundly. She went into the hall and down the stairs; then, leaving the\nhouse through a side door, stepped into the vine-covered arbor that led\nto the garden lodge. The scent of the June roses was heavy in the still\nair, and the stones that paved the path felt pleasantly cool through the\nthin soles of her slippers. Heat-lightning flashed continuously from the\nbank of clouds that had gathered over the sea, but the shore was flooded\nwith moonlight and, beyond, the rim of the Sound lay smooth and shining.\nCaroline had the key of the lodge, and the door creaked as she opened\nit. She stepped into the long, low room radiant with the moonlight which\nstreamed through the bow window and lay in a silvery pool along the\nwaxed floor. Even that part of the room which lay in the shadow was\nvaguely illuminated; the piano, the tall candlesticks, the picture\nframes and white casts standing out as clearly in the half-light as\ndid the sycamores and black poplars of the garden against the still,\nexpectant night sky. Caroline sat down to think it all over. She had\ncome here to do just that every day of the two weeks since d'Esquerre's\ndeparture, but, far from ever having reached a conclusion, she had\nsucceeded only in losing her way in a maze of memories--sometimes\nbewilderingly confused, sometimes too acutely distinct--where there was\nneither path, nor clue, nor any hope of finality. She had, she realized,\ndefeated a lifelong regimen; completely confounded herself by falling\nunaware and incontinently into that luxury of reverie which, even as\na little girl, she had so determinedly denied herself, she had been\ndeveloping with alarming celerity that part of one which sets up an idol\nand that part of one which bows down and worships it.\n\nIt was a mistake, she felt, ever to have asked d'Esquerre to come\nat all. She had an angry feeling that she had done it rather in\nself-defiance, to rid herself finally of that instinctive fear of him\nwhich had always troubled and perplexed her. She knew that she had\nreckoned with herself before he came; but she had been equal to so much\nthat she had never really doubted she would be equal to this. She had\ncome to believe, indeed, almost arrogantly in her own malleability and\nendurance; she had done so much with herself that she had come to think\nthat there was nothing which she could not do; like swimmers, overbold,\nwho reckon upon their strength and their power to hoard it, forgetting\nthe ever-changing moods of their adversary, the sea.\n\nAnd d'Esquerre was a man to reckon with. Caroline did not deceive\nherself now upon that score. She admitted it humbly enough, and since\nshe had said good-by to him she had not been free for a moment from\nthe sense of his formidable power. It formed the undercurrent of her\nconsciousness; whatever she might be doing or thinking, it went on,\ninvoluntarily, like her breathing, sometimes welling up until suddenly\nshe found herself suffocating. There was a moment of this tonight,\nand Caroline rose and stood shuddering, looking about her in the blue\nduskiness of the silent room. She had not been here at night before, and\nthe spirit of the place seemed more troubled and insistent than ever it\nhad in the quiet of the afternoons. Caroline brushed her hair back from\nher damp forehead and went over to the bow window. After raising it\nshe sat down upon the low seat. Leaning her head against the sill, and\nloosening her nightgown at the throat, she half-closed her eyes\nand looked off into the troubled night, watching the play of the\nheat-lightning upon the massing clouds between the pointed tops of the\npoplars.\n\nYes, she knew, she knew well enough, of what absurdities this spell was\nwoven; she mocked, even while she winced. His power, she knew, lay not\nso much in anything that he actually had--though he had so much--or\nin anything that he actually was, but in what he suggested, in what he\nseemed picturesque enough to have or be and that was just anything\nthat one chose to believe or to desire. His appeal was all the more\npersuasive and alluring in that it was to the imagination alone, in that\nit was as indefinite and impersonal as those cults of idealism which\nso have their way with women. What he had was that, in his mere\npersonality, he quickened and in a measure gratified that something\nwithout which--to women--life is no better than sawdust, and to the\ndesire for which most of their mistakes and tragedies and astonishingly\npoor bargains are due.\n\nD'Esquerre had become the center of a movement, and the Metropolitan\nhad become the temple of a cult. When he could be induced to cross the\nAtlantic, the opera season in New York was successful; when he\ncould not, the management lost money; so much everyone knew. It was\nunderstood, too, that his superb art had disproportionately little to do\nwith his peculiar position. Women swayed the balance this way or that;\nthe opera, the orchestra, even his own glorious art, achieved at such a\ncost, were but the accessories of himself; like the scenery and costumes\nand even the soprano, they all went to produce atmosphere, were the mere\nmechanics of the beautiful illusion.\n\nCaroline understood all this; tonight was not the first time that she\nhad put it to herself so. She had seen the same feeling in other people,\nwatched for it in her friends, studied it in the house night after night\nwhen he sang, candidly putting herself among a thousand others.\n\nD'Esquerre's arrival in the early winter was the signal for a feminine\nhegira toward New York. On the nights when he sang women flocked to\nthe Metropolitan from mansions and hotels, from typewriter desks,\nschoolrooms, shops, and fitting rooms. They were of all conditions\nand complexions. Women of the world who accepted him knowingly as they\nsometimes took champagne for its agreeable effect; sisters of charity\nand overworked shopgirls, who received him devoutly; withered women who\nhad taken doctorate degrees and who worshipped furtively through prism\nspectacles; business women and women of affairs, the Amazons who dwelt\nafar from men in the stony fastnesses of apartment houses. They all\nentered into the same romance; dreamed, in terms as various as the hues\nof fantasy, the same dream; drew the same quick breath when he stepped\nupon the stage, and, at his exit, felt the same dull pain of shouldering\nthe pack again.\n\nThere were the maimed, even; those who came on crutches, who were pitted\nby smallpox or grotesquely painted by cruel birth stains. These, too,\nentered with him into enchantment. Stout matrons became slender girls\nagain; worn spinsters felt their cheeks flush with the tenderness of\ntheir lost youth. Young and old, however hideous, however fair, they\nyielded up their heat--whether quick or latent--sat hungering for the\nmystic bread wherewith he fed them at this eucharist of sentiment.\n\nSometimes, when the house was crowded from the orchestra to the last row\nof the gallery, when the air was charged with this ecstasy of fancy,\nhe himself was the victim of the burning reflection of his power. They\nacted upon him in turn; he felt their fervent and despairing appeal to\nhim; it stirred him as the spring drives the sap up into an old tree;\nhe, too, burst into bloom. For the moment he, too, believed again,\ndesired again, he knew not what, but something.\n\nBut it was not in these exalted moments that Caroline had learned to\nfear him most. It was in the quiet, tired reserve, the dullness, even,\nthat kept him company between these outbursts that she found that\nexhausting drain upon her sympathies which was the very pith\nand substance of their alliance. It was the tacit admission of\ndisappointment under all this glamour of success--the helplessness of\nthe enchanter to at all enchant himself--that awoke in her an illogical,\nwomanish desire to in some way compensate, to make it up to him.\n\nShe had observed drastically to herself that it was her eighteenth year\nhe awoke in her--those hard years she had spent in turning gowns and\nplacating tradesmen, and which she had never had time to live. After\nall, she reflected, it was better to allow one's self a little youth--to\ndance a little at the carnival and to live these things when they are\nnatural and lovely, not to have them coming back on one and demanding\narrears when they are humiliating and impossible. She went over tonight\nall the catalogue of her self-deprivations; recalled how, in the light\nof her father's example, she had even refused to humor her innocent\ntaste for improvising at the piano; how, when she began to teach, after\nher mother's death, she had struck out one little indulgence after\nanother, reducing her life to a relentless routine, unvarying as\nclockwork. It seemed to her that ever since d'Esquerre first came into\nthe house she had been haunted by an imploring little girlish ghost that\nfollowed her about, wringing its hands and entreating for an hour of\nlife.\n\nThe storm had held off unconscionably long; the air within the lodge was\nstifling, and without the garden waited, breathless. Everything seemed\npervaded by a poignant distress; the hush of feverish, intolerable\nexpectation. The still earth, the heavy flowers, even the growing\ndarkness, breathed the exhaustion of protracted waiting. Caroline felt\nthat she ought to go; that it was wrong to stay; that the hour and the\nplace were as treacherous as her own reflections. She rose and began to\npace the floor, stepping softly, as though in fear of awakening someone,\nher figure, in its thin drapery, diaphanously vague and white. Still\nunable to shake off the obsession of the intense stillness, she sat down\nat the piano and began to run over the first act of the _Walkure_, the\nlast of his roles they had practiced together; playing listlessly and\nabsently at first, but with gradually increasing seriousness. Perhaps it\nwas the still heat of the summer night, perhaps it was the heavy odors\nfrom the garden that came in through the open windows; but as she played\nthere grew and grew the feeling that he was there, beside her, standing\nin his accustomed place. In the duet at the end of the first act she\nheard him clearly: _“Thou art the Spring for which I sighed in Winter's\ncold embraces.”_ Once as he sang it, he had put his arm about her,\nhis one hand under her heart, while with the other he took her right\nfrom the keyboard, holding her as he always held _Sieglinde_ when he\ndrew her toward the window. She had been wonderfully the mistress of\nherself at the time; neither repellent nor acquiescent. She remembered\nthat she had rather exulted, then, in her self-control--which he had\nseemed to take for granted, though there was perhaps the whisper of a\nquestion from the hand under her heart. _“Thou art the Spring for which\nI sighed in Winter's cold embraces.”_ Caroline lifted her hands quickly\nfrom the keyboard, and she bowed her head in them, sobbing.\n\nThe storm broke and the rain beat in, spattering her nightdress until\nshe rose and lowered the windows. She dropped upon the couch and began\nfighting over again the battles of other days, while the ghosts of the\nslain rose as from a sowing of dragon's teeth, The shadows of things,\nalways so scorned and flouted, bore down upon her merciless and\ntriumphant. It was not enough; this happy, useful, well-ordered life\nwas not enough. It did not satisfy, it was not even real. No, the other\nthings, the shadows--they were the realities. Her father, poor Heinrich,\neven her mother, who had been able to sustain her poor romance and keep\nher little illusions amid the tasks of a scullion, were nearer happiness\nthan she. Her sure foundation was but made ground, after all, and the\npeople in Klingsor's garden were more fortunate, however barren the\nsands from which they conjured their paradise.\n\nThe lodge was still and silent; her fit of weeping over, Caroline\nmade no sound, and within the room, as without in the garden, was the\nblackness of storm. Only now and then a flash of lightning showed a\nwoman's slender figure rigid on the couch, her face buried in her hands.\n\nToward morning, when the occasional rumbling of thunder was heard no\nmore and the beat of the raindrops upon the orchard leaves was steadier,\nshe fell asleep and did not waken until the first red streaks of dawn\nshone through the twisted boughs of the apple trees. There was a moment\nbetween world and world, when, neither asleep nor awake, she felt her\ndream grow thin, melting away from her, felt the warmth under her heart\ngrowing cold. Something seemed to slip from the clinging hold of her\narms, and she groaned protestingly through her parted lips, following\nit a little way with fluttering hands. Then her eyes opened wide and she\nsprang up and sat holding dizzily to the cushions of the couch, staring\ndown at her bare, cold feet, at her laboring breast, rising and falling\nunder her open nightdress.\n\nThe dream was gone, but the feverish reality of it still pervaded her\nand she held it as the vibrating string holds a tone. In the last hour\nthe shadows had had their way with Caroline. They had shown her the\nnothingness of time and space, of system and discipline, of closed doors\nand broad waters. Shuddering, she thought of the Arabian fairy tale in\nwhich the genie brought the princess of China to the sleeping prince\nof Damascus and carried her through the air back to her palace at dawn.\nCaroline closed her eyes and dropped her elbows weakly upon her knees,\nher shoulders sinking together. The horror was that it had not come\nfrom without, but from within. The dream was no blind chance; it was the\nexpression of something she had kept so close a prisoner that she had\nnever seen it herself, it was the wail from the donjon deeps when the\nwatch slept. Only as the outcome of such a night of sorcery could the\nthing have been loosed to straighten its limbs and measure itself with\nher; so heavy were the chains upon it, so many a fathom deep, it was\ncrushed down into darkness. The fact that d'Esquerre happened to be on\nthe other side of the world meant nothing; had he been here, beside her,\nit could scarcely have hurt her self-respect so much. As it was, she was\nwithout even the extenuation of an outer impulse, and she could scarcely\nhave despised herself more had she come to him here in the night three\nweeks ago and thrown herself down upon the stone slab at the door there.\n\nCaroline rose unsteadily and crept guiltily from the lodge and along the\npath under the arbor, terrified lest the servants should be stirring,\ntrembling with the chill air, while the wet shrubbery, brushing against\nher, drenched her nightdress until it clung about her limbs.\n\nAt breakfast her husband looked across the table at her with concern.\n“It seems to me that you are looking rather fagged, Caroline. It was a\nbeastly night to sleep. Why don't you go up to the mountains until this\nhot weather is over? By the way, were you in earnest about letting the\nlodge stand?”\n\nCaroline laughed quietly. “No, I find I was not very serious. I haven't\nsentiment enough to forego a summer house. Will you tell Baker to come\ntomorrow to talk it over with me? If we are to have a house party, I\nshould like to put him to work on it at once.”\n\nNoble gave her a glance, half-humorous, half-vexed. “Do you know I am\nrather disappointed?” he said. “I had almost hoped that, just for once,\nyou know, you would be a little bit foolish.”\n\n“Not now that I've slept over it,” replied Caroline, and they both rose\nfrom the table, laughing.\n\n\n\n\nThe Marriage of Phaedra\n\nThe sequence of events was such that MacMaster did not make his\npilgrimage to Hugh Treffinger's studio until three years after that\npainter's death. MacMaster was himself a painter, an American of the\nGallicized type, who spent his winters in New York, his summers in\nParis, and no inconsiderable amount of time on the broad waters between.\nHe had often contemplated stopping in London on one of his return trips\nin the late autumn, but he had always deferred leaving Paris until the\nprick of necessity drove him home by the quickest and shortest route.\n\nTreffinger was a comparatively young man at the time of his death, and\nthere had seemed no occasion for haste until haste was of no avail.\nThen, possibly, though there had been some correspondence between them,\nMacMaster felt certain qualms about meeting in the flesh a man who in\nthe flesh was so diversely reported. His intercourse with Treffinger's\nwork had been so deep and satisfying, so apart from other appreciations,\nthat he rather dreaded a critical juncture of any sort. He had always\nfelt himself singularly inept in personal relations, and in this case he\nhad avoided the issue until it was no longer to be feared or hoped for.\nThere still remained, however, Treffinger's great unfinished picture,\nthe _Marriage of Phaedra_, which had never left his studio, and of which\nMacMaster's friends had now and again brought report that it was the\npainter's most characteristic production.\n\nThe young man arrived in London in the evening, and the next morning\nwent out to Kensington to find Treffinger's studio. It lay in one of the\nperplexing bystreets off Holland Road, and the number he found on a\ndoor set in a high garden wall, the top of which was covered with broken\ngreen glass and over which a budding lilac bush nodded. Treffinger's\nplate was still there, and a card requesting visitors to ring for the\nattendant. In response to MacMaster's ring, the door was opened by a\ncleanly built little man, clad in a shooting jacket and trousers that\nhad been made for an ampler figure. He had a fresh complexion, eyes of\nthat common uncertain shade of gray, and was closely shaven except for\nthe incipient muttonchops on his ruddy cheeks. He bore himself in\na manner strikingly capable, and there was a sort of trimness and\nalertness about him, despite the too-generous shoulders of his coat. In\none hand he held a bulldog pipe, and in the other a copy of _Sporting\nLife_. While MacMaster was explaining the purpose of his call he noticed\nthat the man surveyed him critically, though not impertinently. He was\nadmitted into a little tank of a lodge made of whitewashed stone, the\nback door and windows opening upon a garden. A visitor's book and a pile\nof catalogues lay on a deal table, together with a bottle of ink and\nsome rusty pens. The wall was ornamented with photographs and colored\nprints of racing favorites.\n\n“The studio is h'only open to the public on Saturdays and Sundays,”\n explained the man--he referred to himself as “Jymes”--“but of course we\nmake exceptions in the case of pynters. Lydy Elling Treffinger 'erself\nis on the Continent, but Sir 'Ugh's orders was that pynters was to 'ave\nthe run of the place.” He selected a key from his pocket and threw open\nthe door into the studio which, like the lodge, was built against the\nwall of the garden.\n\nMacMaster entered a long, narrow room, built of smoothed planks, painted\na light green; cold and damp even on that fine May morning. The room was\nutterly bare of furniture--unless a stepladder, a model throne, and a\nrack laden with large leather portfolios could be accounted such--and\nwas windowless, without other openings than the door and the skylight,\nunder which hung the unfinished picture itself. MacMaster had never\nseen so many of Treffinger's paintings together. He knew the painter\nhad married a woman with money and had been able to keep such of\nhis pictures as he wished. These, with all of his replicas and\nstudies, he had left as a sort of common legacy to the younger men of\nthe school he had originated.\n\nAs soon as he was left alone MacMaster sat down on the edge of the model\nthrone before the unfinished picture. Here indeed was what he had come\nfor; it rather paralyzed his receptivity for the moment, but gradually\nthe thing found its way to him.\n\nAt one o'clock he was standing before the collection of studies done for\n_Boccaccio's Garden_ when he heard a voice at his elbow.\n\n“Pardon, sir, but I was just about to lock up and go to lunch. Are\nyou lookin' for the figure study of Boccaccio 'imself?” James queried\nrespectfully. “Lydy Elling Treffinger give it to Mr. Rossiter to take\ndown to Oxford for some lectures he's been agiving there.”\n\n“Did he never paint out his studies, then?” asked MacMaster with\nperplexity. “Here are two completed ones for this picture. Why did he\nkeep them?”\n\n“I don't know as I could say as to that, sir,” replied James, smiling\nindulgently, “but that was 'is way. That is to say, 'e pynted out very\nfrequent, but 'e always made two studies to stand; one in watercolors\nand one in oils, before 'e went at the final picture--to say nothink\nof all the pose studies 'e made in pencil before he begun on the\ncomposition proper at all. He was that particular. You see, 'e wasn't so\nkeen for the final effect as for the proper pyntin' of 'is pictures. 'E\nused to say they ought to be well made, the same as any other h'article\nof trade. I can lay my 'and on the pose studies for you, sir.” He\nrummaged in one of the portfolios and produced half a dozen drawings,\n“These three,” he continued, “was discarded; these two was the pose he\nfinally accepted; this one without alteration, as it were.”\n\n“That's in Paris, as I remember,” James continued reflectively. “It went\nwith the _Saint Cecilia_ into the Baron H---'s collection. Could you\ntell me, sir, 'as 'e it still? I don't like to lose account of them, but\nsome 'as changed 'ands since Sir 'Ugh's death.”\n\n“H---'s collection is still intact, I believe,” replied MacMaster. “You\nwere with Treffinger long?”\n\n“From my boyhood, sir,” replied James with gravity. “I was a stable boy\nwhen 'e took me.”\n\n“You were his man, then?”\n\n“That's it, sir. Nobody else ever done anything around the studio.\nI always mixed 'is colors and 'e taught me to do a share of the\nvarnishin'; 'e said as 'ow there wasn't a 'ouse in England as could\ndo it proper. You ayn't looked at the _Marriage_ yet, sir?” he asked\nabruptly, glancing doubtfully at MacMaster, and indicating with his\nthumb the picture under the north light.\n\n“Not very closely. I prefer to begin with something simpler; that's\nrather appalling, at first glance,” replied MacMaster.\n\n“Well may you say that, sir,” said James warmly. “That one regular\nkilled Sir 'Ugh; it regular broke 'im up, and nothink will ever convince\nme as 'ow it didn't bring on 'is second stroke.”\n\nWhen MacMaster walked back to High Street to take his bus his mind was\ndivided between two exultant convictions. He felt that he had not\nonly found Treffinger's greatest picture, but that, in James, he had\ndiscovered a kind of cryptic index to the painter's personality--a clue\nwhich, if tactfully followed, might lead to much.\n\nSeveral days after his first visit to the studio, MacMaster wrote to\nLady Mary Percy, telling her that he would be in London for some time\nand asking her if he might call. Lady Mary was an only sister of Lady\nEllen Treffinger, the painter's widow, and MacMaster had known her\nduring one winter he spent at Nice. He had known her, indeed, very well,\nand Lady Mary, who was astonishingly frank and communicative upon\nall subjects, had been no less so upon the matter of her sister's\nunfortunate marriage.\n\nIn her reply to his note Lady Mary named an afternoon when she would be\nalone. She was as good as her word, and when MacMaster arrived he\nfound the drawing room empty. Lady Mary entered shortly after he was\nannounced. She was a tall woman, thin and stiffly jointed, and her body\nstood out under the folds of her gown with the rigor of cast iron.\nThis rather metallic suggestion was further carried out in her heavily\nknuckled hands, her stiff gray hair, and her long, bold-featured face,\nwhich was saved from freakishness only by her alert eyes.\n\n“Really,” said Lady Mary, taking a seat beside him and giving him a sort\nof military inspection through her nose glasses, “really, I had begun to\nfear that I had lost you altogether. It's four years since I saw you\nat Nice, isn't it? I was in Paris last winter, but I heard nothing from\nyou.”\n\n“I was in New York then.”\n\n“It occurred to me that you might be. And why are you in London?”\n\n“Can you ask?” replied MacMaster gallantly.\n\nLady Mary smiled ironically. “But for what else, incidentally?”\n\n“Well, incidentally, I came to see Treffinger's studio and his\nunfinished picture. Since I've been here, I've decided to stay the\nsummer. I'm even thinking of attempting to do a biography of him.”\n\n“So that is what brought you to London?”\n\n“Not exactly. I had really no intention of anything so serious when I\ncame. It's his last picture, I fancy, that has rather thrust it upon me.\nThe notion has settled down on me like a thing destined.”\n\n“You'll not be offended if I question the clemency of such a destiny,”\n remarked Lady Mary dryly. “Isn't there rather a surplus of books on that\nsubject already?”\n\n“Such as they are. Oh, I've read them all”--here MacMaster faced Lady\nMary triumphantly. “He has quite escaped your amiable critics,” he\nadded, smiling.\n\n“I know well enough what you think, and I daresay we are not much on\nart,” said Lady Mary with tolerant good humor. “We leave that to peoples\nwho have no physique. Treffinger made a stir for a time, but it\nseems that we are not capable of a sustained appreciation of such\nextraordinary methods. In the end we go back to the pictures we find\nagreeable and unperplexing. He was regarded as an experiment, I fancy;\nand now it seems that he was rather an unsuccessful one. If you've come\nto us in a missionary spirit, we'll tolerate you politely, but we'll\nlaugh in our sleeve, I warn you.”\n\n“That really doesn't daunt me, Lady Mary,” declared MacMaster blandly.\n“As I told you, I'm a man with a mission.”\n\nLady Mary laughed her hoarse, baritone laugh. “Bravo! And you've come to\nme for inspiration for your panegyric?”\n\nMacMaster smiled with some embarrassment. “Not altogether for that\npurpose. But I want to consult you, Lady Mary, about the advisability\nof troubling Lady Ellen Treffinger in the matter. It seems scarcely\nlegitimate to go on without asking her to give some sort of grace to my\nproceedings, yet I feared the whole subject might be painful to her. I\nshall rely wholly upon your discretion.”\n\n“I think she would prefer to be consulted,” replied Lady Mary\njudicially. “I can't understand how she endures to have the wretched\naffair continually raked up, but she does. She seems to feel a sort of\nmoral responsibility. Ellen has always been singularly conscientious\nabout this matter, insofar as her light goes,--which rather puzzles me,\nas hers is not exactly a magnanimous nature. She is certainly trying to\ndo what she believes to be the right thing. I shall write to her, and\nyou can see her when she returns from Italy.”\n\n“I want very much to meet her. She is, I hope, quite recovered in every\nway,” queried MacMaster, hesitatingly.\n\n“No, I can't say that she is. She has remained in much the same\ncondition she sank to before his death. He trampled over pretty much\nwhatever there was in her, I fancy. Women don't recover from wounds of\nthat sort--at least, not women of Ellen's grain. They go on bleeding\ninwardly.”\n\n“You, at any rate, have not grown more reconciled,” MacMaster ventured.\n\n“Oh I give him his dues. He was a colorist, I grant you; but that is\na vague and unsatisfactory quality to marry to; Lady Ellen Treffinger\nfound it so.”\n\n“But, my dear Lady Mary,” expostulated MacMaster, “and just repress me\nif I'm becoming too personal--but it must, in the first place, have been\na marriage of choice on her part as well as on his.”\n\nLady Mary poised her glasses on her large forefinger and assumed an\nattitude suggestive of the clinical lecture room as she replied. “Ellen,\nmy dear boy, is an essentially romantic person. She is quiet about it,\nbut she runs deep. I never knew how deep until I came against her on the\nissue of that marriage. She was always discontented as a girl; she found\nthings dull and prosaic, and the ardor of his courtship was agreeable\nto her. He met her during her first season in town. She is handsome, and\nthere were plenty of other men, but I grant you your scowling brigand\nwas the most picturesque of the lot. In his courtship, as in everything\nelse, he was theatrical to the point of being ridiculous, but Ellen's\nsense of humor is not her strongest quality. He had the charm of\ncelebrity, the air of a man who could storm his way through anything\nto get what he wanted. That sort of vehemence is particularly effective\nwith women like Ellen, who can be warmed only by reflected heat, and she\ncouldn't at all stand out against it. He convinced her of his necessity;\nand that done, all's done.”\n\n“I can't help thinking that, even on such a basis, the marriage should\nhave turned out better,” MacMaster remarked reflectively.\n\n“The marriage,” Lady Mary continued with a shrug, “was made on the basis\nof a mutual misunderstanding. Ellen, in the nature of the case, believed\nthat she was doing something quite out of the ordinary in accepting him,\nand expected concessions which, apparently, it never occurred to him to\nmake. After his marriage he relapsed into his old habits of incessant\nwork, broken by violent and often brutal relaxations. He insulted her\nfriends and foisted his own upon her--many of them well calculated to\narouse aversion in any well-bred girl. He had Ghillini constantly at the\nhouse--a homeless vagabond, whose conversation was impossible. I don't\nsay, mind you, that he had not grievances on his side. He had probably\noverrated the girl's possibilities, and he let her see that he was\ndisappointed in her. Only a large and generous nature could have borne\nwith him, and Ellen's is not that. She could not at all understand that\nodious strain of plebeian pride which plumes itself upon not having\nrisen above its sources.”\n\nAs MacMaster drove back to his hotel he reflected that Lady Mary Percy\nhad probably had good cause for dissatisfaction with her brother-in-law.\nTreffinger was, indeed, the last man who should have married into\nthe Percy family. The son of a small tobacconist, he had grown up a\nsign-painter's apprentice; idle, lawless, and practically letterless\nuntil he had drifted into the night classes of the Albert League, where\nGhillini sometimes lectured. From the moment he came under the eye and\ninfluence of that erratic Italian, then a political exile, his life\nhad swerved sharply from its old channel. This man had been at once\nincentive and guide, friend and master, to his pupil. He had taken the\nraw clay out of the London streets and molded it anew. Seemingly he had\ndivined at once where the boy's possibilities lay, and had thrown aside\nevery canon of orthodox instruction in the training of him. Under\nhim Treffinger acquired his superficial, yet facile, knowledge of the\nclassics; had steeped himself in the monkish Latin and medieval romances\nwhich later gave his work so naive and remote a quality. That was the\nbeginning of the wattle fences, the cobble pave, the brown roof beams,\nthe cunningly wrought fabrics that gave to his pictures such a richness\nof decorative effect.\n\nAs he had told Lady Mary Percy, MacMaster had found the imperative\ninspiration of his purpose in Treffinger's unfinished picture,\nthe _Marriage of Phaedra_. He had always believed that the key to\nTreffinger's individuality lay in his singular education; in the _Roman\nde la Rose_, in Boccaccio, and Amadis, those works which had literally\ntranscribed themselves upon the blank soul of the London street boy,\nand through which he had been born into the world of spiritual things.\nTreffinger had been a man who lived after his imagination; and his mind,\nhis ideals and, as MacMaster believed, even his personal ethics, had to\nthe last been colored by the trend of his early training. There was in\nhim alike the freshness and spontaneity, the frank brutality and the\nreligious mysticism, which lay well back of the fifteenth century. In\nthe _Marriage of Phaedra_ MacMaster found the ultimate expression of\nthis spirit, the final word as to Treffinger's point of view.\n\nAs in all Treffinger's classical subjects, the conception was wholly\nmedieval. This Phaedra, just turning from her husband and maidens to\ngreet her husband's son, giving him her first fearsome glance from\nunder her half-lifted veil, was no daughter of Minos. The daughter of\n_heathenesse_ and the early church she was; doomed to torturing visions\nand scourgings, and the wrangling of soul with flesh. The venerable\nTheseus might have been victorious Charlemagne, and Phaedra's maidens\nbelonged rather in the train of Blanche of Castile than at the Cretan\ncourt. In the earlier studies Hippolytus had been done with a more pagan\nsuggestion; but in each successive drawing the glorious figure had been\ndeflowered of something of its serene unconsciousness, until, in the\ncanvas under the skylight, he appeared a very Christian knight.\nThis male figure, and the face of Phaedra, painted with such magical\npreservation of tone under the heavy shadow of the veil, were plainly\nTreffinger's highest achievements of craftsmanship. By what labor he had\nreached the seemingly inevitable composition of the picture--with its\ntwenty figures, its plenitude of light and air, its restful distances\nseen through white porticoes--countless studies bore witness.\n\nFrom James's attitude toward the picture MacMaster could well conjecture\nwhat the painter's had been. This picture was always uppermost in\nJames's mind; its custodianship formed, in his eyes, his occupation.\nHe was manifestly apprehensive when visitors--not many came\nnowadays--lingered near it. “It was the _Marriage_ as killed 'im,” he\nwould often say, “and for the matter 'o that, it did like to 'av been\nthe death of all of us.”\n\nBy the end of his second week in London MacMaster had begun the notes\nfor his study of Hugh Treffinger and his work. When his researches\nled him occasionally to visit the studios of Treffinger's friends and\nerstwhile disciples, he found their Treffinger manner fading as the\nring of Treffinger's personality died out in them. One by one they were\nstealing back into the fold of national British art; the hand that\nhad wound them up was still. MacMaster despaired of them and confined\nhimself more and more exclusively to the studio, to such of Treffinger's\nletters as were available--they were for the most part singularly\nnegative and colorless--and to his interrogation of Treffinger's man.\n\nHe could not himself have traced the successive steps by which he was\ngradually admitted into James's confidence. Certainly most of his adroit\nstrategies to that end failed humiliatingly, and whatever it was that\nbuilt up an understanding between them must have been instinctive and\nintuitive on both sides. When at last James became anecdotal, personal,\nthere was that in every word he let fall which put breath and blood into\nMacMaster's book. James had so long been steeped in that penetrating\npersonality that he fairly exuded it. Many of his very phrases,\nmannerisms, and opinions were impressions that he had taken on like wet\nplaster in his daily contact with Treffinger. Inwardly he was lined\nwith cast-off epitheliums, as outwardly he was clad in the painter's\ndiscarded coats. If the painter's letters were formal and perfunctory,\nif his expressions to his friends had been extravagant, contradictory,\nand often apparently insincere--still, MacMaster felt himself not\nentirely without authentic sources. It was James who possessed\nTreffinger's legend; it was with James that he had laid aside his pose.\nOnly in his studio, alone, and face to face with his work, as it seemed,\nhad the man invariably been himself. James had known him in the one\nattitude in which he was entirely honest; their relation had fallen\nwell within the painter's only indubitable integrity. James's report\nof Treffinger was distorted by no hallucination of artistic insight,\ncolored by no interpretation of his own. He merely held what he\nhad heard and seen; his mind was a sort of camera obscura. His very\nlimitations made him the more literal and minutely accurate.\n\nOne morning, when MacMaster was seated before the _Marriage of Phaedra_,\nJames entered on his usual round of dusting.\n\n“I've 'eard from Lydy Elling by the post, sir,” he remarked, “an' she's\ngive h'orders to 'ave the 'ouse put in readiness. I doubt she'll be 'ere\nby Thursday or Friday next.”\n\n“She spends most of her time abroad?” queried MacMaster; on the subject\nof Lady Treffinger James consistently maintained a very delicate\nreserve.\n\n“Well, you could 'ardly say she does that, sir. She finds the 'ouse a\nbit dull, I daresay, so durin' the season she stops mostly with Lydy\nMary Percy, at Grosvenor Square. Lydy Mary's a h'only sister.” After a\nfew moments he continued, speaking in jerks governed by the rigor of his\ndusting: “H'only this morning I come upon this scarfpin,” exhibiting a\nvery striking instance of that article, “an' I recalled as 'ow Sir 'Ugh\ngive it me when 'e was acourting of Lydy Elling. Blowed if I ever see a\nman go in for a 'oman like 'im! 'E was that gone, sir. 'E never went in\non anythink so 'ard before nor since, till 'e went in on the _Marriage_\nthere--though 'e mostly went in on things pretty keen; 'ad the measles\nwhen 'e was thirty, strong as cholera, an' come close to dyin' of 'em.\n'E wasn't strong for Lydy Elling's set; they was a bit too stiff for\n'im. A free an' easy gentleman, 'e was; 'e liked 'is dinner with a few\nfriends an' them jolly, but 'e wasn't much on what you might call big\naffairs. But once 'e went in for Lydy Elling 'e broke 'imself to new\npaces; He give away 'is rings an' pins, an' the tylor's man an' the\n'aberdasher's man was at 'is rooms continual. 'E got 'imself put up\nfor a club in Piccadilly; 'e starved 'imself thin, an' worrited 'imself\nwhite, an' ironed 'imself out, an' drawed 'imself tight as a bow string.\nIt was a good job 'e come a winner, or I don't know w'at'd 'a been to\npay.”\n\nThe next week, in consequence of an invitation from Lady Ellen\nTreffinger, MacMaster went one afternoon to take tea with her. He was\nshown into the garden that lay between the residence and the studio,\nwhere the tea table was set under a gnarled pear tree. Lady Ellen rose\nas he approached--he was astonished to note how tall she was--and greeted\nhim graciously, saying that she already knew him through her sister.\nMacMaster felt a certain satisfaction in her; in her reassuring poise\nand repose, in the charming modulations of her voice and the indolent\nreserve of her full, almond eyes. He was even delighted to find her\nface so inscrutable, though it chilled his own warmth and made the open\nfrankness he had wished to permit himself impossible. It was a long\nface, narrow at the chin, very delicately featured, yet steeled by an\nimpassive mask of self-control. It was behind just such finely cut,\nclose-sealed faces, MacMaster reflected, that nature sometimes hid\nastonishing secrets. But in spite of this suggestion of hardness he\nfelt that the unerring taste that Treffinger had always shown in larger\nmatters had not deserted him when he came to the choosing of a wife, and\nhe admitted that he could not himself have selected a woman who looked\nmore as Treffinger's wife should look.\n\nWhile he was explaining the purpose of his frequent visits to the studio\nshe heard him with courteous interest. “I have read, I think, everything\nthat has been published on Sir Hugh Treffinger's work, and it seems to\nme that there is much left to be said,” he concluded.\n\n“I believe they are rather inadequate,” she remarked vaguely. She\nhesitated a moment, absently fingering the ribbons of her gown, then\ncontinued, without raising her eyes; “I hope you will not think me too\nexacting if I ask to see the proofs of such chapters of your work as\nhave to do with Sir Hugh's personal life. I have always asked that\nprivilege.”\n\nMacMaster hastily assured her as to this, adding, “I mean to touch on\nonly such facts in his personal life as have to do directly with his\nwork--such as his monkish education under Ghillini.”\n\n“I see your meaning, I think,” said Lady Ellen, looking at him with\nwide, uncomprehending eyes.\n\nWhen MacMaster stopped at the studio on leaving the house he stood for\nsome time before Treffinger's one portrait of himself, that brigand of\na picture, with its full throat and square head; the short upper lip\nblackened by the close-clipped mustache, the wiry hair tossed down over\nthe forehead, the strong white teeth set hard on a short pipestem. He\ncould well understand what manifold tortures the mere grain of the man's\nstrong red and brown flesh might have inflicted upon a woman like Lady\nEllen. He could conjecture, too, Treffinger's impotent revolt against\nthat very repose which had so dazzled him when it first defied his\ndaring; and how once possessed of it, his first instinct had been to\ncrush it, since he could not melt it.\n\nToward the close of the season Lady Ellen Treffinger left town.\nMacMaster's work was progressing rapidly, and he and James wore away\nthe days in their peculiar relation, which by this time had much of\nfriendliness. Excepting for the regular visits of a Jewish picture\ndealer, there were few intrusions upon their solitude. Occasionally\na party of Americans rang at the little door in the garden wall,\nbut usually they departed speedily for the Moorish hall and tinkling\nfountain of the great show studio of London, not far away.\n\nThis Jew, an Austrian by birth, who had a large business in Melbourne,\nAustralia, was a man of considerable discrimination, and at once\nselected the _Marriage of Phaedra_ as the object of his especial\ninterest. When, upon his first visit, Lichtenstein had declared the\npicture one of the things done for time, MacMaster had rather warmed\ntoward him and had talked to him very freely. Later, however, the man's\nrepulsive personality and innate vulgarity so wore upon him that, the\nmore genuine the Jew's appreciation, the more he resented it and the\nmore base he somehow felt it to be. It annoyed him to see Lichtenstein\nwalking up and down before the picture, shaking his head and blinking\nhis watery eyes over his nose glasses, ejaculating: “Dot is a chem, a\nchem! It is wordt to gome den dousant miles for such a bainting, eh? To\nmake Eurobe abbreciate such a work of ardt it is necessary to take it\naway while she is napping. She has never abbreciated until she has lost,\nbut,” knowingly, “she will buy back.”\n\nJames had, from the first, felt such a distrust of the man that he would\nnever leave him alone in the studio for a moment. When Lichtenstein\ninsisted upon having Lady Ellen Treffinger's address James rose to the\npoint of insolence. “It ayn't no use to give it, noway. Lydy Treffinger\nnever has nothink to do with dealers.” MacMaster quietly repented his\nrash confidences, fearing that he might indirectly cause Lady Ellen\nannoyance from this merciless speculator, and he recalled with chagrin\nthat Lichtenstein had extorted from him, little by little, pretty much\nthe entire plan of his book, and especially the place in it which the\n_Marriage of Phaedra_ was to occupy.\n\nBy this time the first chapters of MacMaster's book were in the hands\nof his publisher, and his visits to the studio were necessarily less\nfrequent. The greater part of his time was now employed with the\nengravers who were to reproduce such of Treffinger's pictures as he\nintended to use as illustrations.\n\nHe returned to his hotel late one evening after a long and vexing day at\nthe engravers to find James in his room, seated on his steamer trunk by\nthe window, with the outline of a great square draped in sheets resting\nagainst his knee.\n\n“Why, James, what's up?” he cried in astonishment, glancing inquiringly\nat the sheeted object.\n\n“Ayn't you seen the pypers, sir?” jerked out the man.\n\n“No, now I think of it, I haven't even looked at a paper. I've been at\nthe engravers' plant all day. I haven't seen anything.”\n\nJames drew a copy of the _Times_ from his pocket and handed it to him,\npointing with a tragic finger to a paragraph in the social column. It\nwas merely the announcement of Lady Ellen Treffinger's engagement to\nCaptain Alexander Gresham.\n\n“Well, what of it, my man? That surely is her privilege.”\n\nJames took the paper, turned to another page, and silently pointed to\na paragraph in the art notes which stated that Lady Treffinger had\npresented to the X--gallery the entire collection of paintings and\nsketches now in her late husband's studio, with the exception of his\nunfinished picture, the _Marriage Of Phaedra_, which she had sold for\na large sum to an Australian dealer who had come to London purposely to\nsecure some of Treffinger's paintings.\n\nMacMaster pursed up his lips and sat down, his overcoat still on.\n“Well, James, this is something of a--something of a jolt, eh? It never\noccurred to me she'd really do it.”\n\n“Lord, you don't know 'er, sir,” said James bitterly, still staring at\nthe floor in an attitude of abandoned dejection.\n\nMacMaster started up in a flash of enlightenment, “What on earth have\nyou got there, James? It's not-surely it's not--”\n\n“Yes, it is, sir,” broke in the man excitedly. “It's the _Marriage_\nitself. It ayn't agoing to H'Australia, no'ow!”\n\n“But man, what are you going to do with it? It's Lichtenstein's property\nnow, as it seems.”\n\n“It ayn't, sir, that it ayn't. No, by Gawd, it ayn't!” shouted James,\nbreaking into a choking fury. He controlled himself with an effort\nand added supplicatingly: “Oh, sir, you ayn't agoing to see it go to\nH'Australia, w'ere they send convic's?” He unpinned and flung aside the\nsheets as though to let _Phaedra_ plead for herself.\n\nMacMaster sat down again and looked sadly at the doomed masterpiece.\nThe notion of James having carried it across London that night rather\nappealed to his fancy. There was certainly a flavor about such a\nhighhanded proceeding. “However did you get it here?” he queried.\n\n“I got a four-wheeler and come over direct, sir. Good job I 'appened to\n'ave the chaynge about me.”\n\n“You came up High Street, up Piccadilly, through the Haymarket and\nTrafalgar Square, and into the Strand?” queried MacMaster with a relish.\n\n“Yes, sir. Of course, sir,” assented James with surprise.\n\nMacMaster laughed delightedly. “It was a beautiful idea, James, but I'm\nafraid we can't carry it any further.”\n\n“I was thinkin' as 'ow it would be a rare chance to get you to take the\n_Marriage_ over to Paris for a year or two, sir, until the thing blows\nover?” suggested James blandly.\n\n“I'm afraid that's out of the question, James. I haven't the right stuff\nin me for a pirate, or even a vulgar smuggler, I'm afraid.” MacMaster\nfound it surprisingly difficult to say this, and he busied himself with\nthe lamp as he said it. He heard James's hand fall heavily on the trunk\ntop, and he discovered that he very much disliked sinking in the man's\nestimation.\n\n“Well, sir,” remarked James in a more formal tone, after a protracted\nsilence; “then there's nothink for it but as 'ow I'll 'ave to make way\nwith it myself.”\n\n“And how about your character, James? The evidence would be heavy\nagainst you, and even if Lady Treffinger didn't prosecute you'd be done\nfor.”\n\n“Blow my character!--your pardon, sir,” cried James, starting to his\nfeet. “W'at do I want of a character? I'll chuck the 'ole thing, and\ndamned lively, too. The shop's to be sold out, an' my place is gone\nany'ow. I'm agoing to enlist, or try the gold fields. I've lived too\nlong with h'artists; I'd never give satisfaction in livery now. You know\n'ow it is yourself, sir; there ayn't no life like it, no'ow.”\n\nFor a moment MacMaster was almost equal to abetting James in his theft.\nHe reflected that pictures had been whitewashed, or hidden in the crypts\nof churches, or under the floors of palaces from meaner motives, and to\nsave them from a fate less ignominious. But presently, with a sigh, he\nshook his head.\n\n“No, James, it won't do at all. It has been tried over and over again,\never since the world has been agoing and pictures amaking. It was tried\nin Florence and in Venice, but the pictures were always carried away in\nthe end. You see, the difficulty is that although Treffinger told you\nwhat was not to be done with the picture, he did not say definitely what\nwas to be done with it. Do you think Lady Treffinger really understands\nthat he did not want it to be sold?”\n\n“Well, sir, it was like this, sir,” said James, resuming his seat on the\ntrunk and again resting the picture against his knee. “My memory is as\nclear as glass about it. After Sir 'Ugh got up from 'is first stroke, 'e\ntook a fresh start at the _Marriage_. Before that 'e 'ad been working\nat it only at night for a while back; the _Legend_ was the big picture\nthen, an' was under the north light w'ere 'e worked of a morning. But\none day 'e bid me take the _Legend_ down an' put the _Marriage_ in its\nplace, an' 'e says, dashin' on 'is jacket, 'Jymes, this is a start for\nthe finish, this time.'\n\n“From that on 'e worked at the night picture in the mornin'--a thing\ncontrary to 'is custom. The _Marriage_ went wrong, and wrong--an' Sir\n'Ugh agettin' seedier an' seedier every day. 'E tried models an' models,\nan' smudged an' pynted out on account of 'er face goin' wrong in the\nshadow. Sometimes 'e layed it on the colors, an' swore at me an' things\nin general. He got that discouraged about 'imself that on 'is low days\n'e used to say to me: 'Jymes, remember one thing; if anythink 'appens to\nme, the _Marriage_ is not to go out of 'ere unfinished. It's worth the\nlot of 'em, my boy, an' it's not agoing to go shabby for lack of pains.'\n'E said things to that effect repeated.\n\n“He was workin' at the picture the last day, before 'e went to 'is club.\n'E kept the carriage waitin' near an hour while 'e put on a stroke an'\nthen drawed back for to look at it, an' then put on another, careful\nlike. After 'e 'ad 'is gloves on, 'e come back an' took away the brushes\nI was startin' to clean, an' put in another touch or two. 'It's acomin',\nJymes,' 'e says, 'by gad if it ayn't.' An' with that 'e goes out. It was\ncruel sudden, w'at come after.\n\n“That night I was lookin' to 'is clothes at the 'ouse when they brought\n'im 'ome. He was conscious, but w'en I ran downstairs for to 'elp lift\n'im up, I knowed 'e was a finished man. After we got 'im into bed 'e\nkept lookin' restless at me and then at Lydy Elling and ajerkin' of 'is\n'and. Finally 'e quite raised it an' shot 'is thumb out toward the wall.\n'He wants water; ring, Jymes,' says Lydy Elling, placid. But I knowed 'e\nwas pointin' to the shop.\n\n“'Lydy Treffinger,' says I, bold, 'he's pointin' to the studio. He means\nabout the _Marriage_; 'e told me today as 'ow 'e never wanted it sold\nunfinished. Is that it, Sir 'Ugh?'\n\n“He smiled an' nodded slight an' closed 'is eyes. 'Thank you, Jymes,'\nsays Lydy Elling, placid. Then 'e opened 'is eyes an' looked long and\n'ard at Lydy Elling.\n\n“'Of course I'll try to do as you'd wish about the picture, 'Ugh, if\nthat's w'at's troublin' you,' she says quiet. With that 'e closed 'is\neyes and 'e never opened 'em. He died unconscious at four that mornin'.\n\n“You see, sir, Lydy Elling was always cruel 'ard on the _Marriage_. From\nthe first it went wrong, an' Sir 'Ugh was out of temper pretty constant.\nShe came into the studio one day and looked at the picture an 'asked\n'im why 'e didn't throw it up an' quit aworriting 'imself. He answered\nsharp, an' with that she said as 'ow she didn't see w'at there was to\nmake such a row about, no'ow. She spoke 'er mind about that picture,\nfree; an' Sir 'Ugh swore 'ot an' let a 'andful of brushes fly at 'is\nstudy, an' Lydy Elling picked up 'er skirts careful an' chill, an'\ndrifted out of the studio with 'er eyes calm and 'er chin 'igh. If there\nwas one thing Lydy Elling 'ad no comprehension of, it was the usefulness\nof swearin'. So the _Marriage_ was a sore thing between 'em. She is\nuncommon calm, but uncommon bitter, is Lydy Elling. She's never come\nanear the studio since that day she went out 'oldin' up of 'er skirts.\nW'en 'er friends goes over she excuses 'erself along o' the strain.\nStrain--Gawd!” James ground his wrath short in his teeth.\n\n“I'll tell you what I'll do, James, and it's our only hope. I'll see\nLady Ellen tomorrow. The _Times_ says she returned today. You take the\npicture back to its place, and I'll do what I can for it. If anything is\ndone to save it, it must be done through Lady Ellen Treffinger herself,\nthat much is clear. I can't think that she fully understands the\nsituation. If she did, you know, she really couldn't have any motive--”\n He stopped suddenly. Somehow, in the dusky lamplight, her small,\nclose-sealed face came ominously back to him. He rubbed his forehead\nand knitted his brows thoughtfully. After a moment he shook his head\nand went on: “I am positive that nothing can be gained by highhanded\nmethods, James. Captain Gresham is one of the most popular men in\nLondon, and his friends would tear up Treffinger's bones if he were\nannoyed by any scandal of our making--and this scheme you propose would\ninevitably result in scandal. Lady Ellen has, of course, every legal\nright to sell the picture. Treffinger made considerable inroads upon\nher estate, and, as she is about to marry a man without income, she\ndoubtless feels that she has a right to replenish her patrimony.”\n\nHe found James amenable, though doggedly skeptical. He went down into\nthe street, called a carriage, and saw James and his burden into it.\nStanding in the doorway, he watched the carriage roll away through\nthe drizzling mist, weave in and out among the wet, black vehicles and\ndarting cab lights, until it was swallowed up in the glare and confusion\nof the Strand. “It is rather a fine touch of irony,” he reflected,\n“that he, who is so out of it, should be the one to really care. Poor\nTreffinger,” he murmured as, with a rather spiritless smile, he turned\nback into his hotel. “Poor Treffinger; _sic transit gloria_.”\n\nThe next afternoon MacMaster kept his promise. When he arrived at Lady\nMary Percy's house he saw preparations for a function of some sort, but\nhe went resolutely up the steps, telling the footman that his business\nwas urgent. Lady Ellen came down alone, excusing her sister. She was\ndressed for receiving, and MacMaster had never seen one so beautiful.\nThe color in her cheeks sent a softening glow over her small, delicately\ncut features.\n\nMacMaster apologized for his intrusion and came unflinchingly to the\nobject of his call. He had come, he said, not only to offer her his\nwarmest congratulations, but to express his regret that a great work of\nart was to leave England.\n\nLady Treffinger looked at him in wide-eyed astonishment. Surely, she\nsaid, she had been careful to select the best of the pictures for the\nX--- gallery, in accordance with Sir Hugh Treffinger's wishes.\n\n“And did he--pardon me, Lady Treffinger, but in mercy set my mind at\nrest--did he or did he not express any definite wish concerning this one\npicture, which to me seems worth all the others, unfinished as it is?”\n\nLady Treffinger paled perceptibly, but it was not the pallor of\nconfusion. When she spoke there was a sharp tremor in her smooth voice,\nthe edge of a resentment that tore her like pain. “I think his man has\nsome such impression, but I believe it to be utterly unfounded. I cannot\nfind that he ever expressed any wish concerning the disposition of the\npicture to any of his friends. Unfortunately, Sir Hugh was not always\ndiscreet in his remarks to his servants.”\n\n“Captain Gresham, Lady Ellingham, and Miss Ellingham,” announced a\nservant, appearing at the door.\n\nThere was a murmur in the hall, and MacMaster greeted the smiling\nCaptain and his aunt as he bowed himself out.\n\nTo all intents and purposes the _Marriage of Phaedra_ was already\nentombed in a vague continent in the Pacific, somewhere on the other\nside of the world.\n\n\n\n\nA Wagner Matinee\n\nI received one morning a letter, written in pale ink on glassy,\nblue-lined notepaper, and bearing the postmark of a little Nebraska\nvillage. This communication, worn and rubbed, looking as though it had\nbeen carried for some days in a coat pocket that was none too clean, was\nfrom my Uncle Howard and informed me that his wife had been left a small\nlegacy by a bachelor relative who had recently died, and that it would\nbe necessary for her to go to Boston to attend to the settling of\nthe estate. He requested me to meet her at the station and render her\nwhatever services might be necessary. On examining the date indicated\nas that of her arrival I found it no later than tomorrow. He had\ncharacteristically delayed writing until, had I been away from home for\na day, I must have missed the good woman altogether.\n\nThe name of my Aunt Georgiana called up not alone her own figure,\nat once pathetic and grotesque, but opened before my feet a gulf of\nrecollection so wide and deep that, as the letter dropped from my\nhand, I felt suddenly a stranger to all the present conditions of\nmy existence, wholly ill at ease and out of place amid the familiar\nsurroundings of my study. I became, in short, the gangling farm boy\nmy aunt had known, scourged with chilblains and bashfulness, my hands\ncracked and sore from the corn husking. I felt the knuckles of my thumb\ntentatively, as though they were raw again. I sat again before her\nparlor organ, fumbling the scales with my stiff, red hands, while she,\nbeside me, made canvas mittens for the huskers.\n\nThe next morning, after preparing my landlady somewhat, I set out for\nthe station. When the train arrived I had some difficulty in finding my\naunt. She was the last of the passengers to alight, and it was not until\nI got her into the carriage that she seemed really to recognize me. She\nhad come all the way in a day coach; her linen duster had become black\nwith soot, and her black bonnet gray with dust, during the journey. When\nwe arrived at my boardinghouse the landlady put her to bed at once and I\ndid not see her again until the next morning.\n\nWhatever shock Mrs. Springer experienced at my aunt's appearance she\nconsiderately concealed. As for myself, I saw my aunt's misshapen figure\nwith that feeling of awe and respect with which we behold explorers who\nhave left their ears and fingers north of Franz Josef Land, or their\nhealth somewhere along the Upper Congo. My Aunt Georgiana had been a\nmusic teacher at the Boston Conservatory, somewhere back in the latter\nsixties. One summer, while visiting in the little village among the\nGreen Mountains where her ancestors had dwelt for generations, she\nhad kindled the callow fancy of the most idle and shiftless of all the\nvillage lads, and had conceived for this Howard Carpenter one of\nthose extravagant passions which a handsome country boy of twenty-one\nsometimes inspires in an angular, spectacled woman of thirty. When she\nreturned to her duties in Boston, Howard followed her, and the upshot of\nthis inexplicable infatuation was that she eloped with him, eluding the\nreproaches of her family and the criticisms of her friends by going with\nhim to the Nebraska frontier. Carpenter, who, of course, had no money,\nhad taken a homestead in Red Willow County, fifty miles from the\nrailroad. There they had measured off their quarter section themselves\nby driving across the prairie in a wagon, to the wheel of which they had\ntied a red cotton handkerchief, and counting off its revolutions. They\nbuilt a dugout in the red hillside, one of those cave dwellings whose\ninmates so often reverted to primitive conditions. Their water they got\nfrom the lagoons where the buffalo drank, and their slender stock of\nprovisions was always at the mercy of bands of roving Indians. For\nthirty years my aunt had not been further than fifty miles from the\nhomestead.\n\nBut Mrs. Springer knew nothing of all this, and must have been\nconsiderably shocked at what was left of my kinswoman. Beneath the\nsoiled linen duster which, on her arrival, was the most conspicuous\nfeature of her costume, she wore a black stuff dress, whose\nornamentation showed that she had surrendered herself unquestioningly\ninto the hands of a country dressmaker. My poor aunt's figure, however,\nwould have presented astonishing difficulties to any dressmaker.\nOriginally stooped, her shoulders were now almost bent together over her\nsunken chest. She wore no stays, and her gown, which trailed unevenly\nbehind, rose in a sort of peak over her abdomen. She wore ill-fitting\nfalse teeth, and her skin was as yellow as a Mongolian's from constant\nexposure to a pitiless wind and to the alkaline water which hardens the\nmost transparent cuticle into a sort of flexible leather.\n\nI owed to this woman most of the good that ever came my way in my\nboyhood, and had a reverential affection for her. During the years\nwhen I was riding herd for my uncle, my aunt, after cooking the three\nmeals--the first of which was ready at six o'clock in the morning-and\nputting the six children to bed, would often stand until midnight at\nher ironing board, with me at the kitchen table beside her, hearing me\nrecite Latin declensions and conjugations, gently shaking me when my\ndrowsy head sank down over a page of irregular verbs. It was to her, at\nher ironing or mending, that I read my first Shakespeare', and her old\ntextbook on mythology was the first that ever came into my empty hands.\nShe taught me my scales and exercises, too--on the little parlor organ,\nwhich her husband had bought her after fifteen years, during which she\nhad not so much as seen any instrument, but an accordion that belonged\nto one of the Norwegian farmhands. She would sit beside me by the hour,\ndarning and counting while I struggled with the “Joyous Farmer,” but she\nseldom talked to me about music, and I understood why. She was a pious\nwoman; she had the consolations of religion and, to her at least, her\nmartyrdom was not wholly sordid. Once when I had been doggedly beating\nout some easy passages from an old score of _Euryanthe_ I had found\namong her music books, she came up to me and, putting her hands over my\neyes, gently drew my head back upon her shoulder, saying tremulously,\n“Don't love it so well, Clark, or it may be taken from you. Oh, dear\nboy, pray that whatever your sacrifice may be, it be not that.”\n\nWhen my aunt appeared on the morning after her arrival she was still in\na semi-somnambulant state. She seemed not to realize that she was in the\ncity where she had spent her youth, the place longed for hungrily half\na lifetime. She had been so wretchedly train-sick throughout the journey\nthat she had no recollection of anything but her discomfort, and, to all\nintents and purposes, there were but a few hours of nightmare between\nthe farm in Red Willow County and my study on Newbury Street. I had\nplanned a little pleasure for her that afternoon, to repay her for some\nof the glorious moments she had given me when we used to milk together\nin the straw-thatched cowshed and she, because I was more than usually\ntired, or because her husband had spoken sharply to me, would tell me\nof the splendid performance of the _Huguenots_ she had seen in Paris,\nin her youth. At two o'clock the Symphony Orchestra was to give a Wagner\nprogram, and I intended to take my aunt; though, as I conversed with her\nI grew doubtful about her enjoyment of it. Indeed, for her own sake,\nI could only wish her taste for such things quite dead, and the\nlong struggle mercifully ended at last. I suggested our visiting the\nConservatory and the Common before lunch, but she seemed altogether too\ntimid to wish to venture out. She questioned me absently about various\nchanges in the city, but she was chiefly concerned that she had\nforgotten to leave instructions about feeding half-skimmed milk to\na certain weakling calf, “old Maggie's calf, you know, Clark,” she\nexplained, evidently having forgotten how long I had been away. She was\nfurther troubled because she had neglected to tell her daughter about\nthe freshly opened kit of mackerel in the cellar, which would spoil if\nit were not used directly.\n\nI asked her whether she had ever heard any of the Wagnerian operas and\nfound that she had not, though she was perfectly familiar with their\nrespective situations, and had once possessed the piano score of _The\nFlying Dutchman_. I began to think it would have been best to get her\nback to Red Willow County without waking her, and regretted having\nsuggested the concert.\n\nFrom the time we entered the concert hall, however, she was a trifle\nless passive and inert, and for the first time seemed to perceive her\nsurroundings. I had felt some trepidation lest she might become aware\nof the absurdities of her attire, or might experience some painful\nembarrassment at stepping suddenly into the world to which she had been\ndead for a quarter of a century. But, again, I found how superficially\nI had judged her. She sat looking about her with eyes as impersonal,\nalmost as stony, as those with which the granite Rameses in a\nmuseum watches the froth and fret that ebbs and flows about his\npedestal-separated from it by the lonely stretch of centuries. I have\nseen this same aloofness in old miners who drift into the Brown Hotel at\nDenver, their pockets full of bullion, their linen soiled, their haggard\nfaces unshaven; standing in the thronged corridors as solitary as though\nthey were still in a frozen camp on the Yukon, conscious that certain\nexperiences have isolated them from their fellows by a gulf no\nhaberdasher could bridge.\n\nWe sat at the extreme left of the first balcony, facing the arch of our\nown and the balcony above us, veritable hanging gardens, brilliant as\ntulip beds. The matinee audience was made up chiefly of women. One\nlost the contour of faces and figures--indeed, any effect of line\nwhatever--and there was only the color of bodices past counting, the\nshimmer of fabrics soft and firm, silky and sheer: red, mauve, pink,\nblue, lilac, purple, ecru, rose, yellow, cream, and white, all the\ncolors that an impressionist finds in a sunlit landscape, with here and\nthere the dead shadow of a frock coat. My Aunt Georgiana regarded them\nas though they had been so many daubs of tube-paint on a palette.\n\nWhen the musicians came out and took their places, she gave a little\nstir of anticipation and looked with quickening interest down over the\nrail at that invariable grouping, perhaps the first wholly familiar\nthing that had greeted her eye since she had left old Maggie and her\nweakling calf. I could feel how all those details sank into her soul,\nfor I had not forgotten how they had sunk into mine when I came fresh\nfrom plowing forever and forever between green aisles of corn, where, as\nin a treadmill, one might walk from daybreak to dusk without perceiving\na shadow of change. The clean profiles of the musicians, the gloss of\ntheir linen, the dull black of their coats, the beloved shapes of the\ninstruments, the patches of yellow light thrown by the green-shaded\nlamps on the smooth, varnished bellies of the cellos and the bass viols\nin the rear, the restless, wind-tossed forest of fiddle necks and bows--I\nrecalled how, in the first orchestra I had ever heard, those long bow\nstrokes seemed to draw the heart out of me, as a conjurer's stick reels\nout yards of paper ribbon from a hat.\n\nThe first number was the _Tannhauser_ overture. When the horns drew out\nthe first strain of the Pilgrim's chorus my Aunt Georgiana clutched\nmy coat sleeve. Then it was I first realized that for her this broke a\nsilence of thirty years; the inconceivable silence of the plains. With\nthe battle between the two motives, with the frenzy of the Venusberg\ntheme and its ripping of strings, there came to me an overwhelming sense\nof the waste and wear we are so powerless to combat; and I saw again the\ntall, naked house on the prairie, black and grim as a wooden fortress;\nthe black pond where I had learned to swim, its margin pitted with\nsun-dried cattle tracks; the rain-gullied clay banks about the naked\nhouse, the four dwarf ash seedlings where the dishcloths were always\nhung to dry before the kitchen door. The world there was the flat world\nof the ancients; to the east, a cornfield that stretched to daybreak;\nto the west, a corral that reached to sunset; between, the conquests of\npeace, dearer bought than those of war.\n\nThe overture closed; my aunt released my coat sleeve, but she said\nnothing. She sat staring at the orchestra through a dullness of thirty\nyears, through the films made little by little by each of the three\nhundred and sixty-five days in every one of them. What, I wondered, did\nshe get from it? She had been a good pianist in her day I knew, and her\nmusical education had been broader than that of most music teachers of\na quarter of a century ago. She had often told me of Mozart's operas and\nMeyerbeer's, and I could remember hearing her sing, years ago, certain\nmelodies of Verdi's. When I had fallen ill with a fever in her house she\nused to sit by my cot in the evening--when the cool, night wind blew\nin through the faded mosquito netting tacked over the window, and I lay\nwatching a certain bright star that burned red above the cornfield--and\nsing “Home to our mountains, O, let us return!” in a way fit to break\nthe heart of a Vermont boy near dead of homesickness already.\n\nI watched her closely through the prelude to _Tristan and Isolde_,\ntrying vainly to conjecture what that seething turmoil of strings and\nwinds might mean to her, but she sat mutely staring at the violin bows\nthat drove obliquely downward, like the pelting streaks of rain in a\nsummer shower. Had this music any message for her? Had she enough left\nto at all comprehend this power which had kindled the world since she\nhad left it? I was in a fever of curiosity, but Aunt Georgiana sat\nsilent upon her peak in Darien. She preserved this utter immobility\nthroughout the number from _The Flying Dutchman_, though her fingers\nworked mechanically upon her black dress, as though, of themselves, they\nwere recalling the piano score they had once played. Poor old hands!\nThey had been stretched and twisted into mere tentacles to hold and\nlift and knead with; the palms unduly swollen, the fingers bent and\nknotted--on one of them a thin, worn band that had once been a wedding\nring. As I pressed and gently quieted one of those groping hands I\nremembered with quivering eyelids their services for me in other days.\n\nSoon after the tenor began the “Prize Song,” I heard a quick drawn\nbreath and turned to my aunt. Her eyes were closed, but the tears were\nglistening on her cheeks, and I think, in a moment more, they were in\nmy eyes as well. It never really died, then--the soul that can suffer so\nexcruciatingly and so interminably; it withers to the outward eye only;\nlike that strange moss which can lie on a dusty shelf half a century and\nyet, if placed in water, grows green again. She wept so throughout the\ndevelopment and elaboration of the melody.\n\nDuring the intermission before the second half of the concert, I\nquestioned my aunt and found that the “Prize Song” was not new to her.\nSome years before there had drifted to the farm in Red Willow County a\nyoung German, a tramp cowpuncher, who had sung the chorus at Bayreuth,\nwhen he was a boy, along with the other peasant boys and girls. Of a\nSunday morning he used to sit on his gingham-sheeted bed in the hands'\nbedroom which opened off the kitchen, cleaning the leather of his boots\nand saddle, singing the “Prize Song,” while my aunt went about her work\nin the kitchen. She had hovered about him until she had prevailed upon\nhim to join the country church, though his sole fitness for this step,\ninsofar as I could gather, lay in his boyish face and his possession of\nthis divine melody. Shortly afterward he had gone to town on the Fourth\nof July, been drunk for several days, lost his money at a faro table,\nridden a saddled Texan steer on a bet, and disappeared with a fractured\ncollarbone. All this my aunt told me huskily, wanderingly, as though she\nwere talking in the weak lapses of illness.\n\n“Well, we have come to better things than the old _Trovatore_ at any\nrate, Aunt Georgie?” I queried, with a well-meant effort at jocularity.\n\nHer lip quivered and she hastily put her handkerchief up to her mouth.\nFrom behind it she murmured, “And you have been hearing this ever\nsince you left me, Clark?” Her question was the gentlest and saddest of\nreproaches.\n\nThe second half of the program consisted of four numbers from the\n_Ring_, and closed with Siegfried's funeral march. My aunt wept quietly,\nbut almost continuously, as a shallow vessel overflows in a rainstorm.\nFrom time to time her dim eyes looked up at the lights which studded the\nceiling, burning softly under their dull glass globes; doubtless they\nwere stars in truth to her. I was still perplexed as to what measure of\nmusical comprehension was left to her, she who had heard nothing but\nthe singing of gospel hymns at Methodist services in the square frame\nschoolhouse on Section Thirteen for so many years. I was wholly unable\nto gauge how much of it had been dissolved in soapsuds, or worked into\nbread, or milked into the bottom of a pail.\n\nThe deluge of sound poured on and on; I never knew what she found in the\nshining current of it; I never knew how far it bore her, or past what\nhappy islands. From the trembling of her face I could well believe that\nbefore the last numbers she had been carried out where the myriad graves\nare, into the gray, nameless burying grounds of the sea; or into some\nworld of death vaster yet, where, from the beginning of the world, hope\nhas lain down with hope and dream with dream and, renouncing, slept.\n\nThe concert was over; the people filed out of the hall chattering\nand laughing, glad to relax and find the living level again, but my\nkinswoman made no effort to rise. The harpist slipped its green felt\ncover over his instrument; the flute players shook the water from their\nmouthpieces; the men of the orchestra went out one by one, leaving the\nstage to the chairs and music stands, empty as a winter cornfield.\n\nI spoke to my aunt. She burst into tears and sobbed pleadingly. “I don't\nwant to go, Clark, I don't want to go!”\n\nI understood. For her, just outside the door of the concert hall, lay\nthe black pond with the cattle-tracked bluffs; the tall, unpainted\nhouse, with weather-curled boards; naked as a tower, the crook-backed\nash seedlings where the dishcloths hung to dry; the gaunt, molting\nturkeys picking up refuse about the kitchen door.\n\n\n\n\nPaul's Case\n\n_A Study in Temperament_\n\nIt was Paul's afternoon to appear before the faculty of the Pittsburgh\nHigh School to account for his various misdemeanors. He had been\nsuspended a week ago, and his father had called at the Principal's\noffice and confessed his perplexity about his son. Paul entered the\nfaculty room suave and smiling. His clothes were a trifle outgrown, and\nthe tan velvet on the collar of his open overcoat was frayed and worn;\nbut for all that there was something of the dandy about him, and he\nwore an opal pin in his neatly knotted black four-in-hand, and a red\ncarnation in his buttonhole. This latter adornment the faculty somehow\nfelt was not properly significant of the contrite spirit befitting a boy\nunder the ban of suspension.\n\nPaul was tall for his age and very thin, with high, cramped shoulders\nand a narrow chest. His eyes were remarkable for a certain hysterical\nbrilliancy, and he continually used them in a conscious, theatrical sort\nof way, peculiarly offensive in a boy. The pupils were abnormally large,\nas though he were addicted to belladonna, but there was a glassy glitter\nabout them which that drug does not produce.\n\nWhen questioned by the Principal as to why he was there Paul stated,\npolitely enough, that he wanted to come back to school. This was a lie,\nbut Paul was quite accustomed to lying; found it, indeed, indispensable\nfor overcoming friction. His teachers were asked to state their\nrespective charges against him, which they did with such a rancor and\naggrievedness as evinced that this was not a usual case, Disorder and\nimpertinence were among the offenses named, yet each of his instructors\nfelt that it was scarcely possible to put into words the real cause of\nthe trouble, which lay in a sort of hysterically defiant manner of the\nboy's; in the contempt which they all knew he felt for them, and which\nhe seemingly made not the least effort to conceal. Once, when he had\nbeen making a synopsis of a paragraph at the blackboard, his English\nteacher had stepped to his side and attempted to guide his hand. Paul\nhad started back with a shudder and thrust his hands violently behind\nhim. The astonished woman could scarcely have been more hurt and\nembarrassed had he struck at her. The insult was so involuntary and\ndefinitely personal as to be unforgettable. In one way and another he\nhad made all his teachers, men and women alike, conscious of the same\nfeeling of physical aversion. In one class he habitually sat with his\nhand shading his eyes; in another he always looked out of the window\nduring the recitation; in another he made a running commentary on the\nlecture, with humorous intention.\n\nHis teachers felt this afternoon that his whole attitude was symbolized\nby his shrug and his flippantly red carnation flower, and they fell\nupon him without mercy, his English teacher leading the pack. He stood\nthrough it smiling, his pale lips parted over his white teeth. (His lips\nwere continually twitching, and he had a habit of raising his eyebrows\nthat was contemptuous and irritating to the last degree.) Older boys\nthan Paul had broken down and shed tears under that baptism of fire, but\nhis set smile did not once desert him, and his only sign of discomfort\nwas the nervous trembling of the fingers that toyed with the buttons of\nhis overcoat, and an occasional jerking of the other hand that held his\nhat. Paul was always smiling, always glancing about him, seeming to feel\nthat people might be watching him and trying to detect something.\nThis conscious expression, since it was as far as possible from boyish\nmirthfulness, was usually attributed to insolence or “smartness.”\n\nAs the inquisition proceeded one of his instructors repeated an\nimpertinent remark of the boy's, and the Principal asked him whether he\nthought that a courteous speech to have made a woman. Paul shrugged his\nshoulders slightly and his eyebrows twitched.\n\n“I don't know,” he replied. “I didn't mean to be polite or impolite,\neither. I guess it's a sort of way I have of saying things regardless.”\n\nThe Principal, who was a sympathetic man, asked him whether he didn't\nthink that a way it would be well to get rid of. Paul grinned and said\nhe guessed so. When he was told that he could go he bowed gracefully and\nwent out. His bow was but a repetition of the scandalous red carnation.\n\nHis teachers were in despair, and his drawing master voiced the feeling\nof them all when he declared there was something about the boy which\nnone of them understood. He added: “I don't really believe that smile of\nhis comes altogether from insolence; there's something sort of haunted\nabout it. The boy is not strong, for one thing. I happen to know that he\nwas born in Colorado, only a few months before his mother died out there\nof a long illness. There is something wrong about the fellow.”\n\nThe drawing master had come to realize that, in looking at Paul, one\nsaw only his white teeth and the forced animation of his eyes. One warm\nafternoon the boy had gone to sleep at his drawing board, and his master\nhad noted with amazement what a white, blue-veined face it was; drawn\nand wrinkled like an old man's about the eyes, the lips twitching even\nin his sleep, and stiff with a nervous tension that drew them back from\nhis teeth.\n\nHis teachers left the building dissatisfied and unhappy; humiliated to\nhave felt so vindictive toward a mere boy, to have uttered this feeling\nin cutting terms, and to have set each other on, as it were, in the\ngruesome game of intemperate reproach. Some of them remembered having\nseen a miserable street cat set at bay by a ring of tormentors.\n\nAs for Paul, he ran down the hill whistling the “Soldiers' Chorus” from\n_Faust_, looking wildly behind him now and then to see whether some of\nhis teachers were not there to writhe under his lightheartedness. As it\nwas now late in the afternoon and Paul was on duty that evening as usher\nat Carnegie Hall, he decided that he would not go home to supper. When\nhe reached the concert hall the doors were not yet open and, as it was\nchilly outside, he decided to go up into the picture gallery--always\ndeserted at this hour--where there were some of Raffelli's gay studies\nof Paris streets and an airy blue Venetian scene or two that always\nexhilarated him. He was delighted to find no one in the gallery but the\nold guard, who sat in one corner, a newspaper on his knee, a black patch\nover one eye and the other closed. Paul possessed himself of the peace\nand walked confidently up and down, whistling under his breath. After a\nwhile he sat down before a blue Rico and lost himself. When he bethought\nhim to look at his watch, it was after seven o'clock, and he rose with\na start and ran downstairs, making a face at Augustus, peering out from\nthe cast room, and an evil gesture at the Venus de Milo as he passed her\non the stairway.\n\nWhen Paul reached the ushers' dressing room half a dozen boys were there\nalready, and he began excitedly to tumble into his uniform. It was one\nof the few that at all approached fitting, and Paul thought it very\nbecoming--though he knew that the tight, straight coat accentuated his\nnarrow chest, about which he was exceedingly sensitive. He was always\nconsiderably excited while he dressed, twanging all over to the tuning\nof the strings and the preliminary flourishes of the horns in the music\nroom; but tonight he seemed quite beside himself, and he teased and\nplagued the boys until, telling him that he was crazy, they put him down\non the floor and sat on him.\n\nSomewhat calmed by his suppression, Paul dashed out to the front of\nthe house to seat the early comers. He was a model usher; gracious and\nsmiling he ran up and down the aisles; nothing was too much trouble\nfor him; he carried messages and brought programs as though it were his\ngreatest pleasure in life, and all the people in his section thought\nhim a charming boy, feeling that he remembered and admired them. As\nthe house filled, he grew more and more vivacious and animated, and the\ncolor came to his cheeks and lips. It was very much as though this were\na great reception and Paul were the host. Just as the musicians came out\nto take their places, his English teacher arrived with checks for the\nseats which a prominent manufacturer had taken for the season. She\nbetrayed some embarrassment when she handed Paul the tickets, and a\nhauteur which subsequently made her feel very foolish. Paul was startled\nfor a moment, and had the feeling of wanting to put her out; what\nbusiness had she here among all these fine people and gay colors? He\nlooked her over and decided that she was not appropriately dressed and\nmust be a fool to sit downstairs in such togs. The tickets had probably\nbeen sent her out of kindness, he reflected as he put down a seat for\nher, and she had about as much right to sit there as he had.\n\nWhen the symphony began Paul sank into one of the rear seats with a long\nsigh of relief, and lost himself as he had done before the Rico. It was\nnot that symphonies, as such, meant anything in particular to Paul,\nbut the first sigh of the instruments seemed to free some hilarious and\npotent spirit within him; something that struggled there like the genie\nin the bottle found by the Arab fisherman. He felt a sudden zest of\nlife; the lights danced before his eyes and the concert hall blazed into\nunimaginable splendor. When the soprano soloist came on Paul forgot even\nthe nastiness of his teacher's being there and gave himself up to\nthe peculiar stimulus such personages always had for him. The soloist\nchanced to be a German woman, by no means in her first youth, and the\nmother of many children; but she wore an elaborate gown and a tiara, and\nabove all she had that indefinable air of achievement, that world-shine\nupon her, which, in Paul's eyes, made her a veritable queen of Romance.\n\nAfter a concert was over Paul was always irritable and wretched until he\ngot to sleep, and tonight he was even more than usually restless. He had\nthe feeling of not being able to let down, of its being impossible to\ngive up this delicious excitement which was the only thing that could\nbe called living at all. During the last number he withdrew and, after\nhastily changing his clothes in the dressing room, slipped out to the\nside door where the soprano's carriage stood. Here he began pacing\nrapidly up and down the walk, waiting to see her come out.\n\nOver yonder, the Schenley, in its vacant stretch, loomed big and square\nthrough the fine rain, the windows of its twelve stories glowing like\nthose of a lighted cardboard house under a Christmas tree. All the\nactors and singers of the better class stayed there when they were in\nthe city, and a number of the big manufacturers of the place lived there\nin the winter. Paul had often hung about the hotel, watching the people\ngo in and out, longing to enter and leave schoolmasters and dull care\nbehind him forever.\n\nAt last the singer came out, accompanied by the conductor, who\nhelped her into her carriage and closed the door with a cordial _auf\nwiedersehen_ which set Paul to wondering whether she were not an old\nsweetheart of his. Paul followed the carriage over to the hotel, walking\nso rapidly as not to be far from the entrance when the singer alighted,\nand disappeared behind the swinging glass doors that were opened by a\nNegro in a tall hat and a long coat. In the moment that the door was\najar it seemed to Paul that he, too, entered. He seemed to feel himself\ngo after her up the steps, into the warm, lighted building, into an\nexotic, tropical world of shiny, glistening surfaces and basking ease.\nHe reflected upon the mysterious dishes that were brought into the\ndining room, the green bottles in buckets of ice, as he had seen them in\nthe supper party pictures of the _Sunday World_ supplement. A quick\ngust of wind brought the rain down with sudden vehemence, and Paul was\nstartled to find that he was still outside in the slush of the gravel\ndriveway; that his boots were letting in the water and his scanty\novercoat was clinging wet about him; that the lights in front of the\nconcert hall were out and that the rain was driving in sheets between\nhim and the orange glow of the windows above him. There it was, what\nhe wanted--tangibly before him, like the fairy world of a Christmas\npantomime--but mocking spirits stood guard at the doors, and, as the\nrain beat in his face, Paul wondered whether he were destined always to\nshiver in the black night outside, looking up at it.\n\nHe turned and walked reluctantly toward the car tracks. The end had to\ncome sometime; his father in his nightclothes at the top of the stairs,\nexplanations that did not explain, hastily improvised fictions that\nwere forever tripping him up, his upstairs room and its horrible yellow\nwallpaper, the creaking bureau with the greasy plush collarbox, and\nover his painted wooden bed the pictures of George Washington and John\nCalvin, and the framed motto, “Feed my Lambs,” which had been worked in\nred worsted by his mother.\n\nHalf an hour later Paul alighted from his car and went slowly down\none of the side streets off the main thoroughfare. It was a highly\nrespectable street, where all the houses were exactly alike, and\nwhere businessmen of moderate means begot and reared large families of\nchildren, all of whom went to Sabbath school and learned the shorter\ncatechism, and were interested in arithmetic; all of whom were as\nexactly alike as their homes, and of a piece with the monotony in which\nthey lived. Paul never went up Cordelia Street without a shudder of\nloathing. His home was next to the house of the Cumberland minister. He\napproached it tonight with the nerveless sense of defeat, the hopeless\nfeeling of sinking back forever into ugliness and commonness that he had\nalways had when he came home. The moment he turned into Cordelia Street\nhe felt the waters close above his head. After each of these orgies\nof living he experienced all the physical depression which follows a\ndebauch; the loathing of respectable beds, of common food, of a house\npenetrated by kitchen odors; a shuddering repulsion for the flavorless,\ncolorless mass of everyday existence; a morbid desire for cool things\nand soft lights and fresh flowers.\n\nThe nearer he approached the house, the more absolutely unequal Paul\nfelt to the sight of it all: his ugly sleeping chamber; the cold\nbathroom with the grimy zinc tub, the cracked mirror, the dripping\nspiggots; his father, at the top of the stairs, his hairy legs sticking\nout from his nightshirt, his feet thrust into carpet slippers. He was\nso much later than usual that there would certainly be inquiries and\nreproaches. Paul stopped short before the door. He felt that he could\nnot be accosted by his father tonight; that he could not toss again on\nthat miserable bed. He would not go in. He would tell his father that he\nhad no carfare and it was raining so hard he had gone home with one of\nthe boys and stayed all night.\n\nMeanwhile, he was wet and cold. He went around to the back of the\nhouse and tried one of the basement windows, found it open, raised it\ncautiously, and scrambled down the cellar wall to the floor. There he\nstood, holding his breath, terrified by the noise he had made, but the\nfloor above him was silent, and there was no creak on the stairs. He\nfound a soapbox, and carried it over to the soft ring of light that\nstreamed from the furnace door, and sat down. He was horribly afraid of\nrats, so he did not try to sleep, but sat looking distrustfully at the\ndark, still terrified lest he might have awakened his father. In such\nreactions, after one of the experiences which made days and nights out\nof the dreary blanks of the calendar, when his senses were deadened,\nPaul's head was always singularly clear. Suppose his father had heard\nhim getting in at the window and had come down and shot him for a\nburglar? Then, again, suppose his father had come down, pistol in hand,\nand he had cried out in time to save himself, and his father had been\nhorrified to think how nearly he had killed him? Then, again, suppose\na day should come when his father would remember that night, and\nwish there had been no warning cry to stay his hand? With this last\nsupposition Paul entertained himself until daybreak.\n\nThe following Sunday was fine; the sodden November chill was broken\nby the last flash of autumnal summer. In the morning Paul had to go to\nchurch and Sabbath school, as always. On seasonable Sunday afternoons\nthe burghers of Cordelia Street always sat out on their front stoops and\ntalked to their neighbors on the next stoop, or called to those across\nthe street in neighborly fashion. The men usually sat on gay cushions\nplaced upon the steps that led down to the sidewalk, while the women, in\ntheir Sunday “waists,” sat in rockers on the cramped porches, pretending\nto be greatly at their ease. The children played in the streets; there\nwere so many of them that the place resembled the recreation grounds of\na kindergarten. The men on the steps--all in their shirt sleeves,\ntheir vests unbuttoned--sat with their legs well apart, their stomachs\ncomfortably protruding, and talked of the prices of things, or told\nanecdotes of the sagacity of their various chiefs and overlords. They\noccasionally looked over the multitude of squabbling children, listened\naffectionately to their high-pitched, nasal voices, smiling to see their\nown proclivities reproduced in their offspring, and interspersed their\nlegends of the iron kings with remarks about their sons' progress at\nschool, their grades in arithmetic, and the amounts they had saved in\ntheir toy banks.\n\nOn this last Sunday of November Paul sat all the afternoon on the lowest\nstep of his stoop, staring into the street, while his sisters, in their\nrockers, were talking to the minister's daughters next door about how\nmany shirtwaists they had made in the last week, and how many waffles\nsomeone had eaten at the last church supper. When the weather was warm,\nand his father was in a particularly jovial frame of mind, the girls\nmade lemonade, which was always brought out in a red-glass pitcher,\nornamented with forget-me-nots in blue enamel. This the girls thought\nvery fine, and the neighbors always joked about the suspicious color of\nthe pitcher.\n\nToday Paul's father sat on the top step, talking to a young man who\nshifted a restless baby from knee to knee. He happened to be the young\nman who was daily held up to Paul as a model, and after whom it was his\nfather's dearest hope that he would pattern. This young man was of a\nruddy complexion, with a compressed, red mouth, and faded, nearsighted\neyes, over which he wore thick spectacles, with gold bows that curved\nabout his ears. He was clerk to one of the magnates of a great steel\ncorporation, and was looked upon in Cordelia Street as a young man with\na future. There was a story that, some five years ago--he was now barely\ntwenty-six--he had been a trifle dissipated, but in order to curb his\nappetites and save the loss of time and strength that a sowing of\nwild oats might have entailed, he had taken his chief's advice, oft\nreiterated to his employees, and at twenty-one had married the first\nwoman whom he could persuade to share his fortunes. She happened to\nbe an angular schoolmistress, much older than he, who also wore thick\nglasses, and who had now borne him four children, all nearsighted, like\nherself.\n\nThe young man was relating how his chief, now cruising in the\nMediterranean, kept in touch with all the details of the business,\narranging his office hours on his yacht just as though he were at home,\nand “knocking off work enough to keep two stenographers busy.” His\nfather told, in turn, the plan his corporation was considering, of\nputting in an electric railway plant in Cairo. Paul snapped his teeth;\nhe had an awful apprehension that they might spoil it all before he got\nthere. Yet he rather liked to hear these legends of the iron kings that\nwere told and retold on Sundays and holidays; these stories of palaces\nin Venice, yachts on the Mediterranean, and high play at Monte Carlo\nappealed to his fancy, and he was interested in the triumphs of these\ncash boys who had become famous, though he had no mind for the cash-boy\nstage.\n\nAfter supper was over and he had helped to dry the dishes, Paul\nnervously asked his father whether he could go to George's to get some\nhelp in his geometry, and still more nervously asked for carfare. This\nlatter request he had to repeat, as his father, on principle, did not\nlike to hear requests for money, whether much or little. He asked Paul\nwhether he could not go to some boy who lived nearer, and told him that\nhe ought not to leave his schoolwork until Sunday; but he gave him the\ndime. He was not a poor man, but he had a worthy ambition to come up\nin the world. His only reason for allowing Paul to usher was that he\nthought a boy ought to be earning a little.\n\nPaul bounded upstairs, scrubbed the greasy odor of the dishwater from\nhis hands with the ill-smelling soap he hated, and then shook over his\nfingers a few drops of violet water from the bottle he kept hidden in\nhis drawer. He left the house with his geometry conspicuously under his\narm, and the moment he got out of Cordelia Street and boarded a downtown\ncar, he shook off the lethargy of two deadening days and began to live\nagain.\n\nThe leading juvenile of the permanent stock company which played at one\nof the downtown theaters was an acquaintance of Paul's, and the boy\nhad been invited to drop in at the Sunday-night rehearsals whenever\nhe could. For more than a year Paul had spent every available moment\nloitering about Charley Edwards's dressing room. He had won a place\namong Edwards's following not only because the young actor, who could\nnot afford to employ a dresser, often found him useful, but because he\nrecognized in Paul something akin to what churchmen term “vocation.”\n\nIt was at the theater and at Carnegie Hall that Paul really lived; the\nrest was but a sleep and a forgetting. This was Paul's fairy tale,\nand it had for him all the allurement of a secret love. The moment he\ninhaled the gassy, painty, dusty odor behind the scenes, he breathed\nlike a prisoner set free, and felt within him the possibility of doing\nor saying splendid, brilliant, poetic things. The moment the cracked\norchestra beat out the overture from _Martha_, or jerked at the serenade\nfrom _Rigoletto_, all stupid and ugly things slid from him, and his\nsenses were deliciously, yet delicately fired.\n\nPerhaps it was because, in Paul's world, the natural nearly always wore\nthe guise of ugliness, that a certain element of artificiality seemed to\nhim necessary in beauty. Perhaps it was because his experience of\nlife elsewhere was so full of Sabbath-school picnics, petty economies,\nwholesome advice as to how to succeed in life, and the inescapable odors\nof cooking, that he found this existence so alluring, these smartly clad\nmen and women so attractive, that he was so moved by these starry apple\norchards that bloomed perennially under the limelight.\n\nIt would be difficult to put it strongly enough how convincingly\nthe stage entrance of that theater was for Paul the actual portal of\nRomance. Certainly none of the company ever suspected it, least of all\nCharley Edwards. It was very like the old stories that used to float\nabout London of fabulously rich Jews, who had subterranean halls there,\nwith palms, and fountains, and soft lamps and richly appareled women\nwho never saw the disenchanting light of London day. So, in the midst of\nthat smoke-palled city, enamored of figures and grimy toil, Paul had\nhis secret temple, his wishing carpet, his bit of blue-and-white\nMediterranean shore bathed in perpetual sunshine.\n\nSeveral of Paul's teachers had a theory that his imagination had been\nperverted by garish fiction, but the truth was that he scarcely ever\nread at all. The books at home were not such as would either tempt or\ncorrupt a youthful mind, and as for reading the novels that some of his\nfriends urged upon him--well, he got what he wanted much more quickly\nfrom music; any sort of music, from an orchestra to a barrel organ.\nHe needed only the spark, the indescribable thrill that made his\nimagination master of his senses, and he could make plots and pictures\nenough of his own. It was equally true that he was not stagestruck--not,\nat any rate, in the usual acceptation of that expression. He had no\ndesire to become an actor, any more than he had to become a musician. He\nfelt no necessity to do any of these things; what he wanted was to see,\nto be in the atmosphere, float on the wave of it, to be carried out,\nblue league after blue league, away from everything.\n\nAfter a night behind the scenes Paul found the schoolroom more than ever\nrepulsive; the bare floors and naked walls; the prosy men who never wore\nfrock coats, or violets in their buttonholes; the women with their dull\ngowns, shrill voices, and pitiful seriousness about prepositions that\ngovern the dative. He could not bear to have the other pupils think, for\na moment, that he took these people seriously; he must convey to them\nthat he considered it all trivial, and was there only by way of a jest,\nanyway. He had autographed pictures of all the members of the stock\ncompany which he showed his classmates, telling them the most incredible\nstories of his familiarity with these people, of his acquaintance with\nthe soloists who came to Carnegie Hall, his suppers with them and the\nflowers he sent them. When these stories lost their effect, and his\naudience grew listless, he became desperate and would bid all the boys\ngood-by, announcing that he was going to travel for a while; going to\nNaples, to Venice, to Egypt. Then, next Monday, he would slip back,\nconscious and nervously smiling; his sister was ill, and he should have\nto defer his voyage until spring.\n\nMatters went steadily worse with Paul at school. In the itch to let his\ninstructors know how heartily he despised them and their homilies, and\nhow thoroughly he was appreciated elsewhere, he mentioned once or twice\nthat he had no time to fool with theorems; adding--with a twitch of\nthe eyebrows and a touch of that nervous bravado which so perplexed\nthem--that he was helping the people down at the stock company; they\nwere old friends of his.\n\nThe upshot of the matter was that the Principal went to Paul's father,\nand Paul was taken out of school and put to work. The manager at\nCarnegie Hall was told to get another usher in his stead; the doorkeeper\nat the theater was warned not to admit him to the house; and Charley\nEdwards remorsefully promised the boy's father not to see him again.\n\nThe members of the stock company were vastly amused when some of Paul's\nstories reached them--especially the women. They were hardworking women,\nmost of them supporting indigent husbands or brothers, and they laughed\nrather bitterly at having stirred the boy to such fervid and florid\ninventions. They agreed with the faculty and with his father that Paul's\nwas a bad case.\n\n\nThe eastbound train was plowing through a January snowstorm; the dull\ndawn was beginning to show gray when the engine whistled a mile out of\nNewark. Paul started up from the seat where he had lain curled in uneasy\nslumber, rubbed the breath-misted window glass with his hand, and peered\nout. The snow was whirling in curling eddies above the white bottom\nlands, and the drifts lay already deep in the fields and along the\nfences, while here and there the long dead grass and dried weed stalks\nprotruded black above it. Lights shone from the scattered houses, and a\ngang of laborers who stood beside the track waved their lanterns.\n\nPaul had slept very little, and he felt grimy and uncomfortable. He\nhad made the all-night journey in a day coach, partly because he was\nashamed, dressed as he was, to go into a Pullman, and partly because he\nwas afraid of being seen there by some Pittsburgh businessman, who might\nhave noticed him in Denny & Carson's office. When the whistle awoke him,\nhe clutched quickly at his breast pocket, glancing about him with an\nuncertain smile. But the little, clay-bespattered Italians were still\nsleeping, the slatternly women across the aisle were in open-mouthed\noblivion, and even the crumby, crying babies were for the nonce stilled.\nPaul settled back to struggle with his impatience as best he could.\n\nWhen he arrived at the Jersey City station he hurried through his\nbreakfast, manifestly ill at ease and keeping a sharp eye about him.\nAfter he reached the Twenty-third Street station, he consulted a cabman\nand had himself driven to a men's-furnishings establishment that was\njust opening for the day. He spent upward of two hours there, buying\nwith endless reconsidering and great care. His new street suit he put\non in the fitting room; the frock coat and dress clothes he had bundled\ninto the cab with his linen. Then he drove to a hatter's and a shoe\nhouse. His next errand was at Tiffany's, where he selected his silver\nand a new scarf pin. He would not wait to have his silver marked,\nhe said. Lastly, he stopped at a trunk shop on Broadway and had his\npurchases packed into various traveling bags.\n\nIt was a little after one o'clock when he drove up to the Waldorf, and\nafter settling with the cabman, went into the office. He registered from\nWashington; said his mother and father had been abroad, and that he\nhad come down to await the arrival of their steamer. He told his story\nplausibly and had no trouble, since he volunteered to pay for them in\nadvance, in engaging his rooms; a sleeping room, sitting room, and bath.\n\nNot once, but a hundred times, Paul had planned this entry into New\nYork. He had gone over every detail of it with Charley Edwards, and in\nhis scrapbook at home there were pages of description about New York\nhotels, cut from the Sunday papers. When he was shown to his sitting\nroom on the eighth floor he saw at a glance that everything was as it\nshould be; there was but one detail in his mental picture that the\nplace did not realize, so he rang for the bellboy and sent him down for\nflowers. He moved about nervously until the boy returned, putting\naway his new linen and fingering it delightedly as he did so. When the\nflowers came he put them hastily into water, and then tumbled into a hot\nbath. Presently he came out of his white bathroom, resplendent in his\nnew silk underwear, and playing with the tassels of his red robe. The\nsnow was whirling so fiercely outside his windows that he could scarcely\nsee across the street, but within the air was deliciously soft and\nfragrant. He put the violets and jonquils on the taboret beside the\ncouch, and threw himself down, with a long sigh, covering himself with\na Roman blanket. He was thoroughly tired; he had been in such haste,\nhe had stood up to such a strain, covered so much ground in the last\ntwenty-four hours, that he wanted to think how it had all come about.\nLulled by the sound of the wind, the warm air, and the cool fragrance of\nthe flowers, he sank into deep, drowsy retrospection.\n\nIt had been wonderfully simple; when they had shut him out of the\ntheater and concert hall, when they had taken away his bone, the\nwhole thing was virtually determined. The rest was a mere matter of\nopportunity. The only thing that at all surprised him was his own\ncourage--for he realized well enough that he had always been tormented by\nfear, a sort of apprehensive dread that, of late years, as the meshes of\nthe lies he had told closed about him, had been pulling the muscles of\nhis body tighter and tighter. Until now he could not remember the time\nwhen he had not been dreading something. Even when he was a little boy\nit was always there--behind him, or before, or on either side. There had\nalways been the shadowed corner, the dark place into which he dared not\nlook, but from which something seemed always to be watching him--and\nPaul had done things that were not pretty to watch, he knew.\n\nBut now he had a curious sense of relief, as though he had at last\nthrown down the gauntlet to the thing in the corner.\n\nYet it was but a day since he had been sulking in the traces; but\nyesterday afternoon that he had been sent to the bank with Denny &\nCarson's deposit, as usual--but this time he was instructed to leave the\nbook to be balanced. There was above two thousand dollars in checks, and\nnearly a thousand in the bank notes which he had taken from the book\nand quietly transferred to his pocket. At the bank he had made out a\nnew deposit slip. His nerves had been steady enough to permit of his\nreturning to the office, where he had finished his work and asked for\na full day's holiday tomorrow, Saturday, giving a perfectly reasonable\npretext. The bankbook, he knew, would not be returned before Monday or\nTuesday, and his father would be out of town for the next week. From\nthe time he slipped the bank notes into his pocket until he boarded the\nnight train for New York, he had not known a moment's hesitation. It was\nnot the first time Paul had steered through treacherous waters.\n\nHow astonishingly easy it had all been; here he was, the thing done;\nand this time there would be no awakening, no figure at the top of the\nstairs. He watched the snowflakes whirling by his window until he fell\nasleep.\n\nWhen he awoke, it was three o'clock in the afternoon. He bounded up with\na start; half of one of his precious days gone already! He spent more\nthan an hour in dressing, watching every stage of his toilet carefully\nin the mirror. Everything was quite perfect; he was exactly the kind of\nboy he had always wanted to be.\n\nWhen he went downstairs Paul took a carriage and drove up Fifth Avenue\ntoward the Park. The snow had somewhat abated; carriages and tradesmen's\nwagons were hurrying soundlessly to and fro in the winter twilight; boys\nin woolen mufflers were shoveling off the doorsteps; the avenue stages\nmade fine spots of color against the white street. Here and there on\nthe corners were stands, with whole flower gardens blooming under glass\ncases, against the sides of which the snowflakes stuck and melted;\nviolets, roses, carnations, lilies of the valley--somehow vastly more\nlovely and alluring that they blossomed thus unnaturally in the snow.\nThe Park itself was a wonderful stage winterpiece.\n\nWhen he returned, the pause of the twilight had ceased and the tune of\nthe streets had changed. The snow was falling faster, lights streamed\nfrom the hotels that reared their dozen stories fearlessly up into\nthe storm, defying the raging Atlantic winds. A long, black stream of\ncarriages poured down the avenue, intersected here and there by other\nstreams, tending horizontally. There were a score of cabs about the\nentrance of his hotel, and his driver had to wait. Boys in livery were\nrunning in and out of the awning stretched across the sidewalk, up and\ndown the red velvet carpet laid from the door to the street. Above,\nabout, within it all was the rumble and roar, the hurry and toss of\nthousands of human beings as hot for pleasure as himself, and on every\nside of him towered the glaring affirmation of the omnipotence of\nwealth.\n\nThe boy set his teeth and drew his shoulders together in a spasm of\nrealization; the plot of all dramas, the text of all romances,\nthe nerve-stuff of all sensations was whirling about him like the\nsnowflakes. He burnt like a faggot in a tempest.\n\nWhen Paul went down to dinner the music of the orchestra came floating\nup the elevator shaft to greet him. His head whirled as he stepped into\nthe thronged corridor, and he sank back into one of the chairs against\nthe wall to get his breath. The lights, the chatter, the perfumes, the\nbewildering medley of color--he had, for a moment, the feeling of\nnot being able to stand it. But only for a moment; these were his own\npeople, he told himself. He went slowly about the corridors, through\nthe writing rooms, smoking rooms, reception rooms, as though he were\nexploring the chambers of an enchanted palace, built and peopled for him\nalone.\n\nWhen he reached the dining room he sat down at a table near a window.\nThe flowers, the white linen, the many-colored wineglasses, the gay\ntoilettes of the women, the low popping of corks, the undulating\nrepetitions of the _Blue Danube_ from the orchestra, all flooded Paul's\ndream with bewildering radiance. When the roseate tinge of his champagne\nwas added--that cold, precious, bubbling stuff that creamed and foamed\nin his glass--Paul wondered that there were honest men in the world at\nall. This was what all the world was fighting for, he reflected; this\nwas what all the struggle was about. He doubted the reality of his\npast. Had he ever known a place called Cordelia Street, a place where\nfagged-looking businessmen got on the early car; mere rivets in a\nmachine they seemed to Paul,--sickening men, with combings of children's\nhair always hanging to their coats, and the smell of cooking in their\nclothes. Cordelia Street--Ah, that belonged to another time and country;\nhad he not always been thus, had he not sat here night after night,\nfrom as far back as he could remember, looking pensively over just such\nshimmering textures and slowly twirling the stem of a glass like this\none between his thumb and middle finger? He rather thought he had.\n\nHe was not in the least abashed or lonely. He had no especial desire to\nmeet or to know any of these people; all he demanded was the right to\nlook on and conjecture, to watch the pageant. The mere stage properties\nwere all he contended for. Nor was he lonely later in the evening, in\nhis lodge at the Metropolitan. He was now entirely rid of his nervous\nmisgivings, of his forced aggressiveness, of the imperative desire\nto show himself different from his surroundings. He felt now that his\nsurroundings explained him. Nobody questioned the purple; he had only to\nwear it passively. He had only to glance down at his attire to reassure\nhimself that here it would be impossible for anyone to humiliate him.\n\nHe found it hard to leave his beautiful sitting room to go to bed that\nnight, and sat long watching the raging storm from his turret window.\nWhen he went to sleep it was with the lights turned on in his bedroom;\npartly because of his old timidity, and partly so that, if he should\nwake in the night, there would be no wretched moment of doubt, no\nhorrible suspicion of yellow wallpaper, or of Washington and Calvin\nabove his bed.\n\nSunday morning the city was practically snowbound. Paul breakfasted\nlate, and in the afternoon he fell in with a wild San Francisco boy,\na freshman at Yale, who said he had run down for a “little flyer” over\nSunday. The young man offered to show Paul the night side of the town,\nand the two boys went out together after dinner, not returning to the\nhotel until seven o'clock the next morning. They had started out in the\nconfiding warmth of a champagne friendship, but their parting in the\nelevator was singularly cool. The freshman pulled himself together to\nmake his train, and Paul went to bed. He awoke at two o'clock in the\nafternoon, very thirsty and dizzy, and rang for icewater, coffee, and\nthe Pittsburgh papers.\n\nOn the part of the hotel management, Paul excited no suspicion. There\nwas this to be said for him, that he wore his spoils with dignity and in\nno way made himself conspicuous. Even under the glow of his wine he was\nnever boisterous, though he found the stuff like a magician's wand for\nwonder-building. His chief greediness lay in his ears and eyes, and his\nexcesses were not offensive ones. His dearest pleasures were the\ngray winter twilights in his sitting room; his quiet enjoyment of his\nflowers, his clothes, his wide divan, his cigarette, and his sense of\npower. He could not remember a time when he had felt so at peace with\nhimself. The mere release from the necessity of petty lying, lying every\nday and every day, restored his self-respect. He had never lied for\npleasure, even at school; but to be noticed and admired, to assert his\ndifference from other Cordelia Street boys; and he felt a good deal\nmore manly, more honest, even, now that he had no need for boastful\npretensions, now that he could, as his actor friends used to say, “dress\nthe part.” It was characteristic that remorse did not occur to him. His\ngolden days went by without a shadow, and he made each as perfect as he\ncould.\n\nOn the eighth day after his arrival in New York he found the whole\naffair exploited in the Pittsburgh papers, exploited with a wealth of\ndetail which indicated that local news of a sensational nature was at a\nlow ebb. The firm of Denny & Carson announced that the boy's father had\nrefunded the full amount of the theft and that they had no intention of\nprosecuting. The Cumberland minister had been interviewed, and expressed\nhis hope of yet reclaiming the motherless lad, and his Sabbath-school\nteacher declared that she would spare no effort to that end. The rumor\nhad reached Pittsburgh that the boy had been seen in a New York hotel,\nand his father had gone East to find him and bring him home.\n\nPaul had just come in to dress for dinner; he sank into a chair, weak\nto the knees, and clasped his head in his hands. It was to be worse than\njail, even; the tepid waters of Cordelia Street were to close over him\nfinally and forever. The gray monotony stretched before him in\nhopeless, unrelieved years; Sabbath school, Young People's Meeting, the\nyellow-papered room, the damp dishtowels; it all rushed back upon him\nwith a sickening vividness. He had the old feeling that the orchestra\nhad suddenly stopped, the sinking sensation that the play was over. The\nsweat broke out on his face, and he sprang to his feet, looked about him\nwith his white, conscious smile, and winked at himself in the mirror,\nWith something of the old childish belief in miracles with which he\nhad so often gone to class, all his lessons unlearned, Paul dressed and\ndashed whistling down the corridor to the elevator.\n\nHe had no sooner entered the dining room and caught the measure of the\nmusic than his remembrance was lightened by his old elastic power of\nclaiming the moment, mounting with it, and finding it all-sufficient.\nThe glare and glitter about him, the mere scenic accessories had again,\nand for the last time, their old potency. He would show himself that he\nwas game, he would finish the thing splendidly. He doubted, more than\never, the existence of Cordelia Street, and for the first time he drank\nhis wine recklessly. Was he not, after all, one of those fortunate\nbeings born to the purple, was he not still himself and in his own\nplace? He drummed a nervous accompaniment to the Pagliacci music and\nlooked about him, telling himself over and over that it had paid.\n\nHe reflected drowsily, to the swell of the music and the chill sweetness\nof his wine, that he might have done it more wisely. He might have\ncaught an outbound steamer and been well out of their clutches before\nnow. But the other side of the world had seemed too far away and too\nuncertain then; he could not have waited for it; his need had been\ntoo sharp. If he had to choose over again, he would do the same thing\ntomorrow. He looked affectionately about the dining room, now gilded\nwith a soft mist. Ah, it had paid indeed!\n\nPaul was awakened next morning by a painful throbbing in his head and\nfeet. He had thrown himself across the bed without undressing, and had\nslept with his shoes on. His limbs and hands were lead heavy, and his\ntongue and throat were parched and burnt. There came upon him one of\nthose fateful attacks of clearheadedness that never occurred except when\nhe was physically exhausted and his nerves hung loose. He lay still,\nclosed his eyes, and let the tide of things wash over him.\n\nHis father was in New York; “stopping at some joint or other,” he told\nhimself. The memory of successive summers on the front stoop fell upon\nhim like a weight of black water. He had not a hundred dollars left; and\nhe knew now, more than ever, that money was everything, the wall that\nstood between all he loathed and all he wanted. The thing was winding\nitself up; he had thought of that on his first glorious day in New York,\nand had even provided a way to snap the thread. It lay on his dressing\ntable now; he had got it out last night when he came blindly up from\ndinner, but the shiny metal hurt his eyes, and he disliked the looks of\nit.\n\nHe rose and moved about with a painful effort, succumbing now and again\nto attacks of nausea. It was the old depression exaggerated; all the\nworld had become Cordelia Street. Yet somehow he was not afraid of\nanything, was absolutely calm; perhaps because he had looked into the\ndark corner at last and knew. It was bad enough, what he saw there, but\nsomehow not so bad as his long fear of it had been. He saw everything\nclearly now. He had a feeling that he had made the best of it, that he\nhad lived the sort of life he was meant to live, and for half an hour he\nsat staring at the revolver. But he told himself that was not the way,\nso he went downstairs and took a cab to the ferry.\n\nWhen Paul arrived in Newark he got off the train and took another cab,\ndirecting the driver to follow the Pennsylvania tracks out of the town.\nThe snow lay heavy on the roadways and had drifted deep in the open\nfields. Only here and there the dead grass or dried weed stalks\nprojected, singularly black, above it. Once well into the country, Paul\ndismissed the carriage and walked, floundering along the tracks, his\nmind a medley of irrelevant things. He seemed to hold in his brain an\nactual picture of everything he had seen that morning. He remembered\nevery feature of both his drivers, of the toothless old woman from whom\nhe had bought the red flowers in his coat, the agent from whom he had\ngot his ticket, and all of his fellow passengers on the ferry. His mind,\nunable to cope with vital matters near at hand, worked feverishly and\ndeftly at sorting and grouping these images. They made for him a part\nof the ugliness of the world, of the ache in his head, and the bitter\nburning on his tongue. He stooped and put a handful of snow into his\nmouth as he walked, but that, too, seemed hot. When he reached a little\nhillside, where the tracks ran through a cut some twenty feet below him,\nhe stopped and sat down.\n\nThe carnations in his coat were drooping with the cold, he noticed,\ntheir red glory all over. It occurred to him that all the flowers he had\nseen in the glass cases that first night must have gone the same way,\nlong before this. It was only one splendid breath they had, in spite of\ntheir brave mockery at the winter outside the glass; and it was a losing\ngame in the end, it seemed, this revolt against the homilies by which\nthe world is run. Paul took one of the blossoms carefully from his coat\nand scooped a little hole in the snow, where he covered it up. Then he\ndozed awhile, from his weak condition, seemingly insensible to the cold.\n\nThe sound of an approaching train awoke him, and he started to his feet,\nremembering only his resolution, and afraid lest he should be too late.\nHe stood watching the approaching locomotive, his teeth chattering,\nhis lips drawn away from them in a frightened smile; once or twice he\nglanced nervously sidewise, as though he were being watched. When\nthe right moment came, he jumped. As he fell, the folly of his haste\noccurred to him with merciless clearness, the vastness of what he had\nleft undone. There flashed through his brain, clearer than ever before,\nthe blue of Adriatic water, the yellow of Algerian sands.\n\nHe felt something strike his chest, and that his body was being thrown\nswiftly through the air, on and on, immeasurably far and fast, while his\nlimbs were gently relaxed. Then, because the picture-making mechanism\nwas crushed, the disturbing visions flashed into black, and Paul dropped\nback into the immense design of things."
