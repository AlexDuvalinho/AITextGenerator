WHEATLEY, F.S.A.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE.\n----\n\n_EVERY reader of_ The Caxtons\n_will remember the description,\nin that charming novel,\nof the gradual growth of Augustine\nCaxton's great work ``The History\nof Human Error,'' and how, in fact,\nthe existence of that work forms the\npivot round which the incidents turn.\nIt was modestly expected to extend to\nfive quarto volumes, but only the first\nseven sheets were printed by Uncle\nJack's Anti-Publishers' Society, ``with\nsundry unfinished plates depicting the\nvarious developments of the human\nskull (that temple of Human Error),''<p _>\nand the remainder has not been heard\nof since.\n\nIn introducing to the reader a small\nbranch of this inexhaustible subject, I\nhave ventured to make use of Augustine\nCaxton's title; but I trust that\nno one will allow himself to imagine\nthat I intend, in the future, to produce\nthe thousand or so volumes which will\nbe required to complete the work.\n\nA satirical friend who has seen the\nproofs of this little volume says it\nshould be entitled ``Jokes Old and New'';\nbut I find that he seldom acknowledges\nthat a joke is new, and I hope, therefore,\nmy readers will transpose the\nadjectives, and accept the old jokes for\nthe sake of the new ones.  I may claim,\nat least, that the series of answers to\nexamination questions, which Prof.\nOliver Lodge has so kindly supplied\nme with, comes within the later class.<p _>\n\nI trust that if some parts of the\nbook are thought to be frivolous, the\nchapters on lists of errata and misprints\nmay be found to contain some\nuseful literary information.\n\nI have availed myself of the published\ncommunications of my friends\nProfessors Hales and Skeat and Dr.\nMurray on Literary Blunders, and\nmy best thanks are also due to several\nfriends who have helped me with some\ncurious instances, and I would specially\nmention Sir George Birdwood,\nK.C.I.E., C.SI.., Mr. Edward Clodd,\nMr. R. B. Prosser, and Sir Henry\nTrueman Wood_.<p _>\n\n\n\nCONTENTS.\n----\nCHAPTER\n\nBLUNDERS IN GENERAL.\n\n                                                  PAGE\n\nDistinction between a blunder and a mistake--\nLong life of a literary blunder\n--Professor Skeat's ``ghost words''--\nDr. Murray's ``ghost words''--Marriage\nService--Absurd etymology--\nImaginary persons--Family pride--\nFortunate blunders--Misquotations--\nBulls from Ireland and elsewhere . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .1\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nBLUNDERS OF AUTHORS.\n\nGoldsmith--French memoir writers--\nHistorians--Napier's bones--Mr. Gladstone--\nLord Macaulay--Newspaper\nwriters--Critics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31\n\n\n<p _>\nCHAPTER III.\n\nBLUNDERS OF TRANSLATORS.\n                                                  PAGE\n\n``Translators are traitors''--Amusing\ntranslations--Translations of names--\nCinderella--``Oh that mine adversary had\nwritten a book''--Perversions of the\ntrue meaning . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL BLUNDERS.\n\nWatt's _Bibliotheca Britannica_--Imaginary\nauthors--Faulty classification . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 63\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nLISTS OF ERRATA.\n\nEarly use of errata--Intentional blunders--\nAuthors correct their books--Ineffectual\nattempts to be immaculate--Misprints\nnever corrected. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 78\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nMISPRINTS.\n\nMisprints not always amusing--A\nDictionary of Misprints--Blades's\n_Shakspere and Typography_--Upper and\nlower cases--Stops--Byron--Wicked\nBible--Malherbe--_Coquilles_--Hood's\nlines--Chaucer--Misplacement of type . . . . . . . . . . . . .100\n\n\n<p _>\n                                                  PAGE\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nSCHOOLBOYS' BLUNDERS.\n\nCleverness of these blunders--\nEtymological guesses--_English as she is\nTaught_--Scriptural confusions--\nMusical blunders--History and geography--\nHow to question--Professor\nOliver Lodge's specimens of answers to\nexamination papers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .157\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nFOREIGNERS ENGLISH.\n\nExhibition English--French Work on the\nSocieties of the World--Hotel keepers'\nEnglish--Barcelona Exhibition--Paris\nExhibition of 1889--How to learn English--\nForeign Guides in so called English\n--Addition to God save the King--\nShenstone. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .188\n\nINDEX. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .215\n\n\n\nLITERARY BLUNDERS.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nBLUNDERS IN GENERAL.\n\nTHE words ``blunder'' and ``mistake''\nare often treated as\nsynonyms; thus we usually\ncall our own blunders mistakes, and\nour friends style our mistakes blunders.\nIn truth the class of blunders is a sub-\ndivision of the _genus_ mistakes.  Many\nmistakes are very serious in their\nconsequences, but there is almost always some\nsense of fun connected with a blunder,\nwhich is a mistake usually caused by some\nmental confusion.  Lexicographers state\nthat it is an error due to stupidity and\ncarelessness, but blunders are often caused<p 1>\n<p 2>by a too great sharpness and quickness.\nSometimes a blunder is no mistake at all,\nas when a man blunders on the right\nexplanation; thus he arrives at the right goal,\nbut by an unorthodox road.  Sir Roger\nL'Estrange says that ``it is one thing to\nforget a matter of fact, and another to\n_blunder_ upon the reason of it.''\n\nSome years ago there was an article in\nthe _Saturday Review_ on ``the knowledge\nnecessary to make a blunder,'' and this\ntitle gives the clue to what a blunder really\nis.  It is caused by a confusion of two\nor more things, and unless something is\nknown of these things a blunder cannot\nbe made.  A perfectly ignorant man has\nnot sufficient knowledge to make a blunder.\n\nAn ordinary blunder may die, and do\nno great harm, but a literary blunder often\nhas an extraordinary life.  Of literary\nblunders probably the philological are the\nmost persistent and the most difficult to\nkill.  In this class may be mentioned (1)\nGhost words, as they are called by Professor\nSkeat--words, that is, which have been\nregistered, but which never really existed;\n(2) Real words that exist through a mis<p 3>take;\nand (3) Absurd etymologies, a large\ndivision crammed with delicious blunders.\n\n1. Professor Skeat, in his presidential\naddress to the members of the Philological\nSociety in 1886, gave a most interesting\naccount of some hundred ghost words, or\nwords which have no real existence.  Those\nwho wish to follow out this subject must\nrefer to the _Philological Transactions_, but\nfour specially curious instances may be\nmentioned here.  These four words are\n``abacot,'' ``knise,'' ``morse,'' and ``polien.''\n_Abacot_ is defined by Webster as ``the cap\nof state formerly used by English kings,\nwrought into the figure of two crowns'';\nbut Dr. Murray, when he was preparing\nthe _New English Dictionary_, discovered\nthat this was an interloper, and unworthy\nof a place in the language.  It was found\nto be a mistake for _by-cocket_, which is the\ncorrect word.  In spite of this exposure\nof the impostor, the word was allowed\nto stand, with a woodcut of an abacot,\nin an important dictionary published\nsubsequently, although Dr. Murray's\nremarks were quoted.  This shows how\ndifficult it is to kill a word which has\n<p 4>once found shelter in our dictionaries.\n_Knise_ is a charming word which first\nappeared in a number of the _Edinburgh\nReview_ in 1808.  Fortunately for the fun\nof the thing, the word occurred in an\narticle on Indian Missions, by Sydney\nSmith.  We read, ``The Hindoos have\nsome very strange customs, which it would\nbe desirable to abolish.  Some swing on\nhooks, some run _knises_ through their\nhands, and widows burn themselves to\ndeath.''  The reviewer was attacked for\nhis statement by Mr. John Styles, and he\nreplied in an article on Methodism printed\nin the _Edinburgh_ in the following year.\nSydney Smith wrote:  ``Mr. Styles is\npeculiarly severe upon us for not being more\nshocked at their piercing their limbs with\n_knises_ . . . it is for us to explain the plan\nand nature of this terrible and unknown\npiece of mechanism.  A _knise_, then, is\nneither more nor less than a false print in\nthe _Edinburgh Review_ for a knife; and\nfrom this blunder of the printer has Mr.\nStyles manufactured this D<ae>dalean instrument\nof torture called a _knise_.''  A similar\ninstance occurs in a misprint of a passage\n<p 5>of one of Scott's novels, but here there is\nthe further amusing circumstance that the\netymology of the false word was settled to\nthe satisfaction of some of the readers.  In\nthe majority of editions of _The Monastery_,\nchapter x., we read:  ``Hardened wretch\n(said Father Eustace), art thou but this\ninstant delivered from death, and dost thou\nso soon morse thoughts of slaughter?''\nThis word is nothing but a misprint of\n_nurse_; but in _Notes and Queries_ two\nindependent correspondents accounted for the\nword _morse_ etymologically.  One explained\nit as ``to prime,'' as when one primes a\nmusket, from O. Fr. _amorce_, powder for the\ntouchhole (Cotgrave), and the other by ``to\nbite'' (Lat. _mordere_), hence ``to indulge\nin biting, stinging or gnawing thoughts of\nslaughter.''  The latter writes:  ``That the\nword as a misprint should have been\nprinted and read by millions for fifty\nyears without being challenged and altered\nexceeds the bounds of probability.''  Yet\nwhen the original MS. of Sir Walter Scott\nwas consulted, it was found that the word\nwas there plainly written _nurse_.\n\nThe Saxon letter for _th_ (<?p>) has long\n<p 6>been a sore puzzle to the uninitiated, and\nit came to be represented by the letter y.\nMost of those who think they are writing\nin a specially archaic manner when they\nspell ``ye'' for ``the'' are ignorant of this,\nand pronounce the article as if it were the\npronoun.  Dr. Skeat quotes a curious instance\nof the misreading of the thorn (<?p>)\nas _p_, by which a strange ghost word is\nevolved.  Whitaker, in his edition of Piers\nPlowman, reads that Christ ``_polede_ for\nman,'' which should be _tholede_, from\n_tholien_, to suffer, as there is no such\nverb as _polien_.\n\nDr. J. A. H. Murray, the learned editor\nof the Philological Society's _New English\nDictionary_, quotes two amusing instances\nof ghost words in a communication to\n_Notes and Queries_ (7th S., vii. 305).  He\nsays:  ``Possessors of Jamieson's Scottish\nDictionary will do well to strike out the\nfictitious entry _cietezour_, cited from Bellenden's\n_Chronicle_ in the plural _cietezouris_,\nwhich is merely a misreading of cietezanis\n(_i.e_. with Scottish z = <?z> = y), _cieteyanis_ or\nciteyanis, Bellenden's regular word for\n_citizens_.  One regrets to see this absurd\n<p 7>mistake copied from Jamieson (unfortunately\nwithout acknowledgment) by the\ncompilers of Cassell's _Encyclop<ae>dic Dictionary_.''\n\n``Some editions of Drayton's _Barons\nWars_, Bk. VI., st. xxxvii., read--\n\n     `` `And ciffy Cynthus with a thousand birds,'\n\nwhich nonsense is solemnly reproduced in\nCampbell's _Specimens of the British Poets_,\niii. 16.  It may save some readers a needless\nreference to the dictionary to remember\nthat it is a misprint for cliffy, a favourite\nword of Drayton's.''\n\n2. In contrast to supposed words that\nnever did exist, are real words that exist\nthrough a mistake, such as _apron_ and _adder_,\nwhere the _n_, which really belongs to the\nword itself, has been supposed, mistakenly,\nto belong to the article; thus apron should\nbe napron (Fr. _naperon_), and adder should\nbe nadder (A.-S. _n<ae>ddre_).  An amusing\nconfusion has arisen in respect to the\nRidings of Yorkshire, of which there are\nthree.  The word should be _triding_, but\nthe _t_ has got lost in the adjective, as West\nTriding became West Riding.  The origin of\n<p 8>the word has thus been quite lost sight of,\nand at the first organisation of the Province\nof Upper Canada, in 1798, the county of\nLincoln was divided into _four_ ridings and\nthe county of York into _two_.  York was\nafterwards supplied with _four_.\n\nSir Henry Bennet, in the reign of\nCharles II., took his title of Earl of\nArlington owing to a blunder.  The proper\nname of the village in Middlesex is\nHarlington.\n\nA curious misunderstanding in the\nMarriage Service has given us two words\ninstead of one.  We now vow to remain\nunited till death us _do part_, but the\noriginal declaration, as given in the first\nPrayer Book of Edward VI., was:  ``I, N.,\ntake thee N., to my wedded wife, to have\nand to hold from this day forward, for\nbetter, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in\nsickness and in health, to love and to\ncherish, till death us depart [or separate].''\n\nIt is not worth while here to register the\nmany words which have taken their present\nspelling through a mistaken view of their\netymology.  They are too numerous, and\nthe consideration of them would open up a\n<p 9>question quite distinct from the one now\nunder consideration.\n\n3. Absurd etymology was once the rule,\nbecause guessing without any knowledge\nof the historical forms of words was\ngeneral; and still, in spite of the modern\nschool of philology, which has shown us\nthe right way, much wild guessing continues\nto be prevalent.  It is not, however,\noften that we can point to such a brilliant\ninstance of blundering etymology as that\nto be found in Barlow's English Dictionary\n(1772).  The word _porcelain_ is there\nsaid to be ``derived from _pour cent annes_,\nFrench for a hundred years, it having been\nimagined that the materials were matured\nunderground for that term of years.''\n\nRichardson, the novelist, suggests an\netymology almost equal to this.  He\nwrites, ``What does correspondence mean?\nIt is a word of Latin origin: a compound\nword; and the two elements here brought\ntogether are _respondeo_, I answer, and _cor_,\nthe heart: _i.e_., I answer feelingly, I reply\nnot so much to the head as to the heart.''\n\nDr. Ash's English Dictionary, published\nin 1775, is an exceedingly useful work, as\n<p 10>containing many words and forms of words\nnowhere else registered, but it contains\nsome curious mistakes.  The chief and\nbest-known one is the explanation of the\nword _curmudgeon_--``from the French\nc<oe>ur, unknown, and _mechant_, a correspondent.''\nThe only explanation of this\nabsurdly confused etymology is that an\nignorant man was employed to copy from\nJohnson's Dictionary, where the authority\nwas given as ``an unknown correspondent,''\nand he, supposing these words to be a\ntranslation of the French, set them down\nas such.  The two words _esoteric_ and\n_exoteric_ were not so frequently used in the\nlast century as they are now; so perhaps\nthere may be some excuse for the following\nentry:  ``Esoteric (adj. an incorrect\nspelling) exoteric.''  Dr. Ash could not\nhave been well read in Arthurian literature,\nor he would not have turned the noble\nknight Sir Gawaine into a woman, ``the\nsister of King Arthur.''  There is a story\nof a blunder in Littleton's Latin Dictionary,\nwhich further research has proved to be\nno mistake at all.  It is said that when\nthe Doctor was compiling his work, and\n<p 11>announced the word _concurro_ to his\namanuensis, the scribe, imagining from the\nsound that the six first letters would give\nthe translation of the verb, said ``Concur,\nsir, I suppose?'' to which the Doctor\npeevishly replied, ``Concur--condog!''\nand in the edition of 1678 ``condog'' is\nprinted as one interpretation of _concurro_.\nNow, an answer to this story is that, however\nodd a word ``condog'' may appear,\nit will be found in Henry Cockeram's\n_English Dictionarie_, first published in\n1623.  The entry is as follows:  ``to agree,\nconcurre, cohere, condog, condiscend.''\n\nMistakes are frequently made in respect\nof foreign words which retain their original\nform, especially those which retain their\nLatin plurals, the feminine singular being\noften confused with the neuter plural.  For\ninstance, there is the word _animalcule_\n(plural _animalcules_), also written _animalculum\n_(plural _animalcula_).  Now, the\nplural _animalcula_ is often supposed to be\nthe feminine singular, and a new plural is\nat once made--_animalcul<ae>_.  This blunder\nis one constantly being made, while it is\nonly occasionally we see a supposed plural\n<p 12>_strat<ae>_ in geology from a supposed singular\nstrata, and the supposed singular _formulum_\nfrom a supposed plural _formula_ will probably\nturn up some day.\n\nIn connection with popular etymology,\nit seems proper to make a passing mention\nof the sailors' perversion of the Bellerophon\ninto the Billy Ruffian, the Hirondelle\ninto the Iron Devil, and La Bonne\nCorvette into the Bonny Cravat.  Some\nof the supposed changes in public-house\nsigns, such as Bull and Mouth from\n``Boulogne mouth,'' and Goat and Compasses\nfrom ``God encompasseth us,'' are\nmore than doubtful; but the Bacchanals\nhas certainly changed into the Bag o' nails,\nand the George Canning into the George\nand Cannon.  The words in the language\nthat have been formed from a false analogy\nare so numerous and have so often been\nnoted that we must not allow them to\ndetain us here longer.\n\nImaginary persons have been brought\ninto being owing to blundering misreading.\nFor instance, there are many saints\nin the Roman calendar whose individuality\nit would not be easy to prove.  All\n<p 13>know how St. Veronica came into being,\nand equally well known is the origin of\nSt. Ursula and her eleven thousand virgins.\nIn this case, through the misreading of\nher name, the unfortunate virgin martyr\nUndecimilla has dropped out of the\ncalendar.\n\nLess known is the origin of Saint Xynoris,\nthe martyr of Antioch, who is noticed in\nthe _Martyrologie Romaine_ of Baronius.\nHer name was obtained by a misreading\nof Chrysostom, who, referring to two\nmartyrs, uses the word <gr xunwr<i!>s> (couple or\npair).\n\nIn the City of London there is a church\ndedicated to St. Vedast, which is situated\nin Foster Lane, and is often described as\nSt. Vedast, _alias_ Foster.  This has puzzled\nmany, and James Paterson, in his _Pietas\nLondinensis_ (1714), hazarded the opinion\nthat the church was dedicated to ``two\nconjunct saints.''  He writes:  ``At the\nfirst it was called St. Foster's in memory\nof some founder or ancient benefactor,\nbut afterwards it was dedicated to St.\nVedast, Bishop of Arras.''  Newcourt\nmakes a similar mistake in his\n_Reper<p 14>torium_, but Thomas Fuller knew the\ntruth, and in his _Church History_ refers to\n``St. Vedastus, _anglice_ St. Fosters.''  This\nis the fact, and the name St. Fauster or\nFoster is nothing more than a corruption\nof St. Vedast, all the steps of which we\nnow know.  My friend Mr. Danby P. Fry\nworked this out some years ago, but his\ndifficulty rested with the second syllable\nof the name Foster; but the links in the\nchain of evidence have been completed\nby reference to Mr. H. C. Maxwell Lyte's\nvaluable Report on the Manuscripts of the\nDean and Chapter of St. Paul's.  The\nfirst stage in the corruption took place in\nFrance, and the name must have been\nintroduced into this country as Vast.\nThis loss of the middle consonant is in\naccordance with the constant practice in\nearly French of dropping out the consonant\npreceding an accented vowel, as\n_reine_ from _regina_.  The change of\n_Augustine_ to _Austin_ is an analogous\ninstance.  _Vast_ would here be pronounced\n_Vaust_, in the same way as the word _vase_\nis still sometimes pronounced _vause_.  The\ninterchange of _v_ and _f_, as in the cases of\n<p 15>_Vane_ and _Fane_ and _fox_ and _vixen_, is too\ncommon to need more than a passing\nnotice.  We have now arrived at the form\nSt. Faust, and the evidence of the old\ndeeds of St. Paul's explains the rest,\nshowing us that the second syllable has grown\nout of the possessive case.  In one of\n8 Edward III. we read of the ``King's\nhighway, called Seint Fastes lane.''  Of\ncourse this was pronounced St. _Faust<e'>s_,\nand we at once have the two syllables.\nThe next form is in a deed of May 1360,\nwhere it stands as ``Seyn Fastreslane.''\nWe have here, not a final _r_ as in the latest\nform, but merely an intrusive trill.  This\nfollows the rule by which thesaurus became\n_treasure, Hebudas, Hebrides_, and _culpatus,\nculprit_.  After the great Fire of London,\nthe church was re-named St. Vedast (_alias_\nFoster)--a form of the name which it\nhad never borne before, except in Latin\ndeeds as Vedastus.[1]  More might be said\n<p 16>of the corruptions of names in the cases\nof other saints, but these corruptions are\nmore the cause of blunders in others than\nblunders in themselves.  It is not often\nthat a new saint is evolved with such an\nEnglish name as Foster.\n\n\n     [1] See an article by the Author in _The Athen<ae>um_,\nJanuary 3rd, 1885, p. 15; and a paper by the\nRev. W. Sparrow Simpson in the _Jourral of\nthe British Arch<ae>ological Association_ (vol. xliii.,\np. 56).\n\n\n\nThe existence of the famous St. Vitus\nhas been doubted, and his dance (_Chorea\nSancti Vit<ae>_) is supposed to have been\noriginally _chorea invita_.  But the strangest\nof saints was S. Viar, who is thus accounted\nfor by D'Israeli in his _Curiosities of\nLiterature_:--\n\n``Mabillon has preserved a curious\nliterary blunder of some pious Spaniards\nwho applied to the Pope for consecrating a\nday in honour of Saint Viar.  His Holiness\nin the voluminous catalogue of his saints\nwas ignorant of this one.  The only proof\nbrought forward for his existence was this\ninscription:--\n\n               S. VIAR.\n\nAn antiquary, however, hindered one more\nfestival in the Catholic calendar by\nconvincing them that these letters were only\nthe remains of an inscription erected for\n<p 17>an ancient surveyor of the roads; and he\nread their saintship thus:--\n\n          [PREFECTV]S VIAR[VM].''\n\n\nForeign travellers in England have\nusually made sad havoc of the names of\nplaces.  Hentzner spelt Gray's Inn and\nLincoln's Inn phonetically as Grezin and\nLinconsin, and so puzzled his editor that he\nsupposed these to be the names of two\ngiants.  A similar mistake to this was that\nof the man who boasted that ``not all the\nBritish House of Commons, not the whole\nbench of Bishops, not even Leviticus himself,\nshould prevent him from marrying his\ndeceased wife's sister.''  One of the jokes\nin Mark Twain's _Huckleberry Finn_\n(ch. xxiii.) turns on the use of this same\nexpression ``Leviticus himself.''\n\nThe picturesque writer who draws a\nwell-filled-in picture from insufficient data\nis peculiarly liable to fall into blunders,\nand when he does fall it is not surprising\nthat less imaginative writers should\nchuckle over his fall.  A few years ago\nan American editor is said to have received\nthe telegram ``Oxford Music Hall\n<p 18>burned to the ground.''  There was not\nmuch information here, and he was ignorant\nof the fact that this building was in\nLondon and in Oxford Street, but he was\nequal to the occasion.  He elaborated a\nremarkable account of the destruction\nby fire of the principal music hall of\nacademic Oxford.  He told how it was\nsituated in the midst of historic colleges\nwhich had miraculously escaped destruction\nby the flames.  These flames, fanned\ninto a fury by a favourable wind, lit up\nthe academic spires and groves as they\nran along the rich cornices, lapped the\ngorgeous pillars, shrivelled up the roof\nand grasped the mighty walls of the\nancient building in their destructive\nembraces.\n\nIn 1882 an announcement was made\nin a weekly paper that some prehistoric\nremains had been found near the Church\nof San Francisco, Florence.  The note\nwas reproduced in an evening paper and\nin an antiquarian monthly with words in\nboth cases implying that the locality of\nthe find was San Francisco, California.\nIt is a common mistake of those who\n<p 19>have heard of Grolier bindings to suppose\nthat the eminent book collector was a\nbinder; but this is nothing to that of the\nworkman who told the writer of this that\nhe had found out the secret of making\nthe famous Henri II. or Oiron ware.  ``In\nfact,'' he added, ``I could make it as well\nas Henry Deux himself.''  The idea of the\nking of France working in the potteries\nis exceedingly fine.\n\nFamily pride is sometimes the cause\nof exceedingly foolish blunders.  The\nfollowing amusing passage in Anderson's\n_Genealogical History of the House of Yvery_\n(1742) illustrates a form of pride ridiculed\nby Lord Chesterfield when he set up on\nhis walls the portraits of Adam de Stanhope\nand Eve de Stanhope.  The having a\nstutterer in the family will appear to most\nreaders to be a strange cause of pride.\nThe author writes:  ``It was usual in ancient\ntimes with the greatest families, and is by\nall genealogists allowed to be a mighty\nevidence of dignity, to use certain nicknames\nwhich the French call sobriquets . . .\nsuch as `the Lame' or `the Black.'. . .\nThe house of Yvery, not deficient in any\n<p 20>mark or proof of greatness and antiquity,\nabounds at different periods in instances\nof this nature.  Roger, a younger son of\nWilliam Youel de Perceval, was surnamed\nBalbus or the Stutterer.''\n\nSometimes a blunder has turned out\nfortunate in its consequences; and a\nstriking instance of this is recorded in the\nhistory of Prussia.  Frederic I.  charged\nhis ambassador Bartholdi with the mission\nof procuring from the Emperor of Germany\nan acknowledgment of the regal\ndignity which he had just assumed.  It\nis said that instructions written in cypher\nwere sent to him, with particular directions\nthat he should not apply on this subject\nto Father Wolff, the Emperor's confessor.\nThe person who copied these instructions,\nhowever, happened to omit the word _not_\nin the copy in cypher.  Bartholdi was\nsurprised at the order, but obeyed it and\nmade the matter known to Wolff; who,\nin the greatest astonishment, declared that\nalthough he had always been hostile to\nthe measure, he could not resist this\nproof of the Elector's confidence, which\nhad made a deep impression upon him.\n<p 21>It was thought that the mediation of the\nconfessor had much to do with the\naccomplishment of the Elector's wishes.\n\nMisquotations form a branch of literary\nblunders which may be mentioned here.\n\nThe text ``He may run that readeth\nit'' (Hab. ii. 2) is almost invariably\nquoted as ``He who runs may read'';\nand the Divine condemnation ``In the\nsweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread'\n(Gen. iii. 19) is usually quoted as ``sweat\nof thy brow.''\n\nThe manner in which Dr. Johnson\nselected the quotations for his Dictionary\nis well known, and as a general rule\nthese are tolerably accurate; but under\nthe thirteenth heading of the verb to\nsit will be found a curious perversion\nof a text of Scripture.  There we read,\n``Asses are ye that sit in judgement--\n_Judges_,'' but of course there is no such\npassage in the Bible.  The correct reading\nof the tenth verse of the fifth chapter is:\n``Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye\nthat sit in judgment, and walk by the\nway.''\n\nFrom misquotations it is an easy step\n<p 22>to pass to mispronunciations.  These are\nmostly too common to be amusing, but\nsometimes the blunderers manage to hit\nupon something which is rather comic.\nThus an ignorant reader coming upon a\nreference to an angle of forty-five degrees\nwas puzzled, and astonished his hearers\nby giving it out as _angel_ of forty-five\ndegrees.  This blunderer, however, was\noutdone by the speaker who described a\ndistinguished personage ``as a very\nindefat<e'm>gable young man,'' adding, ``but even\nhe must succ<uu>mb'' (suck 'um) at last.\n\nAs has already been said, blunders are\noften made by those who are what we\nusually call ``too clever by half.''  Surely\nit was a blunder to change the time-\nhonoured name of King's Bench to\nQueen's Bench.  A queen is a female\nking, and she reigns as a king; the\nabsurdity of the change of sex in the\ndescription is more clearly seen when\nwe find in a Prayer-book published soon\nafter the Queen's accession Her Majesty\ndescribed as ``our Queen and _Governess_.''\n\nEditors of classical authors are often\nlaughed at for their emendations, but\n<p 23>sometimes unjustly.  When we consider\nthe crop of blunders that have gathered\nabout the texts of celebrated books, we\nshall be grateful for the labours of brilliant\nscholars who have cleared these away\nand made obscure passages intelligible.\n\nOne of the most remarkable emendations\never made by an editor is that of\nTheobald in Mrs. Quickly's description of\nFalstaff's deathbed (_King Henry V_., act ii.,\nsc. 4).  The original is unintelligible:\n``his nose was as sharp as a pen and a\ntable of greene fields.''  A friend suggested\nthat it should read `` 'a talked,'' and\nTheobald then suggested `` 'a babbled,'' a reading\nwhich has found its way into all texts,\nand is never likely to be ousted from its\nplace.  Collier's MS. corrector turned the\nsentence into ``as a pen on a table of\ngreen frieze.''  Very few who quote this\npassage from Shakespeare have any notion\nof how much they owe to Theobald.\n\nSometimes blunders are intentionally\nmade--malapropisms which are understood\nby the speaker's intimates, but often\nastonish strangers--such as the expressions\n``the sinecure of every eye,'' ``as white\n<p 24>as the drivelling snow.''[2]  Of intentional\nmistakes, the best known are those which\nhave been called cross readings, in which\nthe reader is supposed to read across the\npage instead of down the column of a\nnewspaper, with such results as the following:--\n\n\n     [2] See _Spectator_, December 24th, 1887, for\nspecimens of family lingo.\n\n\n\n``A new Bank was lately opened at\nNorthampton--<?pointer> no money returned.''\n\n``The Speaker's public dinners will\ncommence next week--admittance, 3/- to\nsee the animals fed.''\n\nAs blunders are a class of mistakes, so\n``bulls'' are a sub-class of blunders.  No\nsatisfactory explanation of the word has\nbeen given, although it appears to be\nintimately connected with the word\nblunder.  Equally the thing itself has not\nbeen very accurately defined.\n\nThe author of _A New Booke of Mistakes_,\n1637, which treats of ``Quips,\nTaunts, Retorts, Flowts, Frumps, Mockes,\nGibes, Jestes, etc.,'' says in his address to\nthe Reader, ``There are moreover other\nsimple mistakes in speech which pass\n<p 25>under the name of Bulls, but if any man\nshall demand of mee why they be so\ncalled, I must put them off with this\nwoman's reason, they are so because they\nbee so.''  All the author can affirm is\nthat they have no connection with the\ninns and playhouses of his time styled\nthe Black Bulls and the Red Bulls.\nColeridge's definition is the best:  ``A\nbull consists in a mental juxtaposition of\nincongruous ideas with the sensation but\nwithout the sense of connection.''[3]\n\n\n     [3] Southey's _Omniana_, vol. i., p. 220.\n\n\n\nBulls are usually associated with the\nIrish, but most other nations are quite\ncapable of making them, and Swift is said\nto have intended to write an essay on\nEnglish bulls and blunders.  Sir Thomas\nTrevor, a Baron of the Exchequer 1625-49,\nwhen presiding at the Bury Assizes, had a\ncause about wintering of cattle before him.\nHe thought the charge immoderate, and\nsaid, ``Why, friend, this is most unreasonable;\nI wonder thou art not ashamed, for\nI myself have known a beast wintered one\nwhole summer for a noble.''  The man at\n<p 26>once, with ready wit, cried, ``That was a\n_bull_, my lord.''  Whereat the company\nwas highly amused.[4]\n\n\n     [4] Thoms, _Anecdotes and Traditions_, 1839, p\n79\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best-known bulls is that\ninscribed on the obelisk near Fort William\nin the Highlands of Scotland.  In this\ninscription a very clumsy attempt is made\nto distinguish between natural tracks and\nmade roads:--\n\n     ``Had you seen these roads before they were made,\n       You would lift up your hands and bless General Wade.''\n\n\nThe bulletins of Pope Clement XIV.'s\nlast illness, which were announced at the\nVatican, culminated in a very fair bull.\nThe notices commenced with ``His Holiness\nis very ill,'' and ended with ``His\nInfallibility is delirious.''\n\nNegro bulls have frequently been\nreported, but the health once proposed by\na worthy black is perhaps as good an\ninstance as could be cited.  He pledged\n``De Gobernor ob our State!  He come\n<p 27>in wid much opposition; he go out wid\nnone at all.''\n\nStill, in spite of the fact that all nations\nfall into these blunders, and that, as it\nhas been said of some, _Hibernicis ipsis\nHibernior_, it is to Ireland that we look\nfor the finest examples of bulls, and we\ndo not usually look in vain.\n\nIt is in a Belfast paper that may be\nread the account of a murder, the result\nof which is described thus:  ``They fired\ntwo shots at him; the first shot killed\nhim, but the second was not fatal.''\nConnoisseurs in bulls will probably say that\nthis is only a blunder.  Perhaps the\nfollowing will please them better:  ``A man\nwas run down by a passenger train and\nkilled; he was injured in a similar way a\nyear ago.''\n\nHere are three good bulls, which fulfil\nall the conditions we expect in this branch\nof wit.  We know what the writer means,\nalthough he does not exactly say it.  This\npassage is from the report of an Irish\nBenevolent Society:  ``Notwithstanding\nthe large amount paid for medicine and\nmedical attendance, very few deaths\n<p 28>occurred during the year.''  A country\neditor's correspondent wrote:  ``Will you\nplease to insert this obituary notice?  I\nmake bold to ask it, because I know the\ndeceased had a great many friends who\nwould be glad to hear of his death.''  The\nthird is quoted in the _Greville Memoirs_:\n``He abjured the errors of the Romish\nChurch, and embraced those of the\nProtestant.''\n\nIt is said that the Irish Statute Book\nopens characteristically with, ``An Act\nthat the King's officers may travel _by sea_\nfrom one place to another within the _land_\nof Ireland''; but one of the main objects\nof the _Essay on Irish Bulls_, by Maria\nEdgeworth and her father, Richard Lovell\nEdgeworth, was to show that the title of\ntheir work was incorrect.  They find the\noriginal of Paddy Blake's echo in Bacon's\nworks:  ``I remember well that when I\nwent to the echo at Port Charenton, there\nwas an old Parisian that took it to be the\nwork of spirits, and of good spirits; `for,'\nsaid he, `call Satan, and the echo will not\ndeliver back the devil's name, but will\nsay, ``Va-t'en.'' ' ''  Mr. Hill Burton found\n<p 29>the original of Sir Boyle Roche's bull of\nthe bird which was in two places at once\nin a letter of a Scotsman--Robertson of\nRowan.  Steele said that all was the effect\nof climate, and that, if an Englishman were\nborn in Ireland, he would make as many\nbulls.  Mistakes of an equally absurd\ncharacter may be found in English Acts\nof Parliament, such as this:  ``The new\ngaol to be built from the materials of\nthe old one, and the prisoners to remain\nin the latter till the former is ready''; or\nthe disposition of the prisoner's punishment\nof transportation for seven years--\n``half to go to the king, and the other half\nto the informer.''  Peter Harrison, an\nannotator on the Pentateuch, observed of\nMoses' two _tables of stone_ that they were\nmade of _shittim wood_.  This is not unlike\nthe title said to have been used for a useful\nlittle work--``Every man his own Washer-\nwoman.''  Horace Walpole said that the\nbest of all bulls was that of the man who,\ncomplaining of his nurse, said, ``I hate\nthat woman, for she changed me at\nnurse.''  But surely this one quoted by\nMr. Hill Burton is far superior to Horace\n<p 30>Walpole's; in fact, one of the best ever\nconceived.  Result of a duel--``The one\nparty received a slight wound in the\nbreast; the other fired in the air--and\nso the matter terminated.''\n\nAfter this the description of the wrongs\nof Ireland has a somewhat artificial look:\n``Her cup of misery has been overflowing,\nand is not yet full.''\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nBLUNDERS OF AUTHORS.\n\nMACAULAY, in his life of\nGoldsmith in the _Encyclop<ae>dia\nBritannica_, relates that that\nauthor, in the _History of England_, tells\nus that Naseby is in Yorkshire, and that\nthe mistake was not corrected when the\nbook was reprinted.  He further affirms\nthat Goldsmith was nearly hoaxed into\nputting into the _History of Greece_ an\naccount of a battle between Alexander the\nGreat and Montezuma.  This, however,\nis scarcely a fair charge, for the backs of\nmost of us need to be broad enough to\nbear the actual blunders we have made\nthroughout life without having to bear\nthose which we almost made.\n\nGoldsmith was a very remarkable\ninstance of a man who undertook to write\nbooks on subjects of which he knew\n<p 32>nothing.  Thus, Johnson said that if he\ncould tell a horse from a cow that was\nthe extent of his knowledge of zoology;\nand yet the _History of Animated Nature_\ncan still be read with pleasure from the\ncharm of the author's style.\n\nSome authors are so careless in the\nconstruction of their works as to contradict in\none part what they have already stated in\nanother.  In the year 1828 an amusing\nwork was published on the clubs of\nLondon, which contained a chapter on\nFighting Fitzgerald, of whom the author\nwrites:  ``That Mr. Fitzgerald (unlike his\ncountrymen generally) was totally devoid\nof generosity, no one who ever knew him\nwill doubt.''  In another chapter on the\nsame person the author flatly contradicts\nhis own judgment:  ``In summing up the\ncatalogue of his vices, however, we ought\nnot to shut our eyes upon his virtues; of\nthe latter, he certainly possessed that one\nfor which his countrymen have always\nbeen so famous, generosity.''  The scissors-\nand-paste compilers are peculiarly liable\nto such errors as these; and a writer in\nthe _Quarterly Review_ proved the _M<e'>moires\n<p 33>de Louis XVIII_. (published in 1832) to\nbe a mendacious compilation from the\n_M<e'>moires de Bachaumont_ by giving examples\nof the compiler's blundering.  One\nof these muddles is well worth quoting,\nand it occurs in the following passage:\n``Seven bishops--of _Puy_, Gallard de\nTerraube; of _Langres_, La Luzerne; of\n_Rhodez_, Seignelay-Colbert; of _Gast_, Le\nTria; of _Blois_, Laussiere Themines; of\n_Nancy_, Fontanges; of _Alais_, Beausset;\nof _Nevers_, Seguiran.''  Had the compiler\ntaken the trouble to count his own list,\nhe would have seen that he had given\neight names instead of seven, and so have\nsuspected that something was wrong; but\nhe was not paid to think.  The fact is\nthat there is no such place as Gast, and\nthere was no such person as Le Tria.  The\nBishop of Rhodez was Seignelay-Colbert\nde Castle Hill, a descendant of the Scotch\nfamily of Cuthbert of Castle Hill, in\nInverness-shire; and Bachaumont misled\nhis successor by writing Gast Le Hill for\nCastle Hill.  The introduction of a stop\nand a little more misspelling resulted in\nthe blunder as we now find it.\n<p 34>\n\nAuthors and editors are very apt to take\nthings for granted, and they thus fall into\nerrors which might have been escaped if\nthey had made inquiries.  Pope, in a note\non _Measure for Measure_, informs us that the\nstory was taken from Cinthio's novel _Dec_. 8\n_Nov_. 5, thus contracting the words decade\nand novel.  Warburton, in his edition of\nShakespeare, was misled by these contractions,\nand fills them up as December 8\nand November 5.  Many blunders are\nmerely clerical errors of the authors, who\nare led into them by a curious association\nof ideas; thus, in the _Lives of the\nLondonderrys_, Sir Archibald Alison, when\ndescribing the funeral of the Duke of\nWellington in St. Paul's, speaks of one of\nthe pall-bearers as Sir Peregrine Pickle,\ninstead of Sir Peregrine Maitland.  Dickens,\nin _Bleak House_, calls Harold Skimpole\nLeonard throughout an entire number,\nbut returns to the old name in a subsequent one.\n\nFew authors require to be more on their\nguard against mistakes than historians,\nespecially as they are peculiarly liable to\nfall into them.  What shall we think of\n<p 35>the authority of a school book when we\nfind the statement that Louis Napoleon\nwas Consul in 1853 before he became\nEmperor of the French?\n\nWe must now pass from a book of small\nvalue to an important work on the history\nof England; but it will be necessary first to\nmake a few explanatory remarks.  Our\nreaders know that English kings for several\ncenturies claimed the power of curing\nscrofula, or king's evil; but they may not be\nso well acquainted with the fact that the\nFrench sovereigns were believed to enjoy\nthe same miraculous power.  Such, however,\nwas the case; and tradition reported\nthat a phial filled with holy oil was sent\ndown from heaven to be used for the\nanointing of the kings at their coronation.\nWe can illustrate this by an anecdote of\nNapoleon.  Lafayette and the first Consul\nhad a conversation one day on the government\nof the United States.  Bonaparte\ndid not agree with Lafayette's views, and\nthe latter told him that ``he was desirous\nof having the little phial broke over his\nhead.''  This _sainte ampulle_, or holy\nvessel, was an important object in the\n<p 36>ceremony, and the virtue of the oil was to\nconfer the power of cure upon the anointed\nking.  This the historian could not have\nknown, or he would not have written:\n``The French were confident in themselves,\nin their fortunes; in the special\ngifts by which they held the stars.''  If\nthis were all the information that was\ngiven us, we should be left in a perfect\nstate of bewilderment while trying to\nunderstand how the French could hold\nthe stars, or, if they were able to hold\nthem, what good it would do them; but\nthe historian adds a note which, although\nit contains some new blunders, gives the\nclue to an explanation of an otherwise\ninexplicable passage.  It is as follows:\n``The Cardinal of Lorraine showed Sir\nWilliam Pickering the precious ointment\nof St. Ampull, wherewith the King of\nFrance was sacred, which he said was sent\nfrom heaven above a thousand years ago,\nand since by miracle preserved, through\nwhose virtue also the king held _les\nestroilles_.''  From this we might imagine\nthat the holy Ampulla was a person; but\nthe clue to the whole confusion is to be\n<p 37>found in the last word of the sentence.\nAs the French language does not contain\nany such word as _estroilles_, there can be\nno doubt that it stands for old French\n_escroilles_, or the king's evil.  The change\nof a few letters has here made the mighty\ndifference between the power of curing\nscrofula and the gift of holding the stars.\n\nIn some copies of John Britton's\n_Descriptive Sketches of Tunbridge Wells_\n(1832) the following extraordinary passage\nwill be found:  ``Judge Jefferies, a man\nwho has rendered his name infamous in\nthe annals of history by the cruelty and\ninjustice he manifested in presiding at the\ntrial of King Charles I.''  The book was\nno sooner issued than the author became\naware of his astonishing chronological\nblunder, and he did all in his power to set\nthe matter right; but a mistake in print\ncan never be entirely obliterated.  However\nmuch trouble may be taken to suppress\na book, some copies will be sure to\nescape, and, becoming valuable by the\nattempted suppression, attract all the more\nattention.\n\nScott makes David Ramsay, in the\n<p 38>_Fortunes of Nigel_ (chapter ii.), swear ``by\nthe bones of the immortal Napier.''  It\nwould perhaps be rank heresy to suppose\nthat Sir Walter did not know that\n``Napier's bones'' were an apparatus for\npurposes of calculation, but he certainly\nputs the expression in such an ambiguous\nform that many of his readers are likely\nto suppose that the actual bones of\nNapier's body were intended.\n\nSome of the most curious of blunders\nare those made by learned men who without\nthought set down something which at\nanother time they would recognise as a\nmistake.  The following passage from\nMr. Gladstone's _Gleanings of Past Years_\n(vol. i., p. 26), in which the author confuses\nDaniel with Shadrach, Meshech, and\nAbednego, has been pointed out:  ``The\nfierce light that beats upon a throne is\nsometimes like the heat of that furnace in\nwhich only Daniel could walk unscathed,\ntoo fierce for those whose place it is to\nstand in its vicinity.''  Who would expect\nto find Macaulay blundering on a subject\nhe knew so well as the story of the\n_Faerie Queene_! and yet this is what he\n<p 39>wrote in a review of Southey's edition\nof the _Pilgrim's Progress_:  ``Nay, even\nSpenser himself, though assuredly one of\nthe greatest poets that ever lived, could\nnot succeed in the attempt to make allegory\ninteresting. . . .  One unpardonable\nfault, the fault of tediousness, pervades\nthe whole of the _Fairy Queen_.  We become\nsick of Cardinal Virtues and Deadly\nSins, and long for the society of plain men\nand women.  Of the persons who read\nthe first Canto, not one in ten reaches the\nend of the first book, and not one in a\nhundred perseveres to the end of the\npoem.  Very few and very weary are\nthose who are in at the death of the\nBlatant Beast.''[5]  Macaulay knew well\nenough that the Blatant Beast did not\ndie in the poem as Spenser left it.\n\n\n     [5] _Edinburgh Review_, vol. liv. (1831), p. 452.\n\n\n\nThe newspaper writers are great sinners,\nand what with the frequent ignorance and\nhaste of the authors and the carelessness\nof the printers a complete farrago of\nnonsense is sometimes concocted between\nthem.  A proper name is seldom given\ncorrectly in a daily paper, and it is a\n<p 40>frequently heard remark that no notice of\nan event is published in which an error in\nthe names or qualifications of the actors\nin it ``is not detected by those acquainted\nwith the circumstances.''  The contributor\nof the following bit of information to the\n_Week's News_ (Nov. 18th, 1871) must\nhave had a very vague notion of what a\nmonosyllable is, or he would not have\nwritten, ``The author of _Dorothy, De\nCressy_, etc., has another novel nearly\nready for the press, which, with the writer's\npartiality for monosyllabic titles, is named\n_Thomasina_.''  He is perhaps the same\nperson who remarked on the late Mr.\nRobertson's fondness for monosyllables\nas titles for his plays, and after instancing\n_Caste, Ours_, and _School_, ended his list with\n_Society_.  We can, however, fly at higher\ngame than this, for some twenty years ago\na writer in the _Times_ fell into the mistake\nof describing the entrance of one of the\nGerman states into the Zollverein in terms\nthat proved him to be labouring under\nthe misconception that the great Customs-\nUnion was a new organisation.  Another\nsource of error in the papers is the hurry\n<p 41>with which bits of news are printed\nbefore they have been authenticated.  Each\neditor wishes to get the start of his\nneighbour, and the consequence is that they\nare frequently deceived.  In a number of\nthe _Literary Gazette_ for 1837 there is a\nparagraph headed ``Sir Michael Faraday,''\nin which the great philosopher is\ncongratulated upon the title which had been\nconferred upon him.  Another source of\nblundering is the attempt to answer an\nopponent before his argument is thoroughly\nunderstood.  A few years ago a\ngentleman made a note in the _Notes and\nQueries_ to the effect that a certain custom\nwas at least 1400 years old, and was probably\nintroduced into England in the fifth\ncentury.  Soon afterwards another gentleman\nwrote to the same journal, ``Assuredly\nthis custom was general before A.D. 1400'';\nbut how he obtained that date out of the\nprevious communication no one can tell.\n\nThe _Times_ made a strange blunder in\ndescribing a gallery of pictures:  ``Mr.\nRobertson's group of `Susannah and the\nElders,' with the name of Pordenone,\ncontains some passages of glowing colour\n<p 42>which must be set off against a good deal\nof clumsy drawing in the central figure of\nthe chaste _maiden_.''  As bad as this was\nthe confusion in the mind of the critic of\nthe New Gallery, who spoke of Mr Hall<e'>'s\n_Paolo and Francesca_ as that masterly\nstudy and production of the old Adam\nphase of human nature which Milton\nhit off so sublimely in the _Inferno_.\n\nA writer in the _Notes and Queries_\nconfused Beersheba with Bathsheba, and\nconferred on the woman the name of the\nplace.\n\nIt has often been remarked that a\nthorough knowledge of the English Bible\nis an education of itself, and a\ncorrespondence in the _Times_ in August 1888\nshows the value of a knowledge of the\nLiturgy of the Church of England.  In a\nleading article occurred the passage, ``We\nhave no doubt whatever that Scotch\njudges and juries will administer indifferent\njustice.''  A correspondent in Glasgow,\nwho supposed _indifferent_ to mean _inferior_,\nwrote to complain at the insinuation\nthat a Scotch jury would not do its\nduty.  The editor of the _Times_ had little\n<p 43>difficulty in answering this by referring to\nthe prayer for the Church militant, where\nare the words, ``Grant unto her [the\nQueen's] whole Council and to all that\nare put in authority under her, that they\nmay truly and indifferently minister justice,\nto the punishment of wickedness and vice,\nand to the maintenance of Thy true\nreligion, and virtue.''\n\nThe compiler of an Anthology made\nthe following remarks in his preface:  ``In\nmaking a selection of this kind one sails\nbetween Scylla and Charybdis--the hackneyed\nand the strange.  I have done my\nbest to steer clear of both these rocks.''\nA leader-writer in a morning paper a\nfew months ago made the same blunder\nwhen he wrote:  ``As a matter of fact, Mr.\nGladstone was bound to bump against\neither Scylla or Charybdis.''  It has\ngenerally been supposed that Scylla only was\na rock.\n\nA most extraordinary blunder was made\nin _Scientific American_ eight or ten years\nago.  An engraving of a handsome Chelsea\nchina vase was presented with the\nfollowing description:  ``In England no\n<p 44>regular hard porcelain is made, but a\nsoft porcelain of great beauty is produced\nfrom kaolin, phosphate of lime,\nand calcined silica.  The principal works\nare situated at Chelsea.  The export of\nthese English porcelains is considerable,\nand it is a curious fact that they are\nlargely imported into China, where they\nare highly esteemed.  Our engraving\nshows a richly ornamented vase in soft\nporcelain from the works at Chelsea.''\nIt could scarcely have been premised\nthat any one would be so ignorant as\nto suppose that Chelsea china was still\nmanufactured, and this paragraph is a\ngood illustration of the evils of journalists\nwriting on subjects about which they know\nnothing.\n\nCritics who are supposed to be immaculate\noften blunder when sitting in judgment\non the sins of authors.  They are\nfrequently puzzled by reprints, and led into\nerror by the disinclination of publishers\nto give particulars in the preface as\nto a book which was written many\nyears before its republication.  A few\nyears ago was issued a reprint of the\n<p 45>translation of the _Arabian Nights_, by\nJonathan Scott, LL.D., which was first\npublished in 1811.  A reviewer having\nthe book before him overlooked this\nimportant fact, and straightway proceeded\nto ``slate'' Dr. Scott for his supposed\nwork of supererogation in making a new\ntranslation when Lane's held the field, the\nfact really being that Scott's translation\npreceded Lane's by nearly thirty years.\n\nAnother critic, having to review a\nreprint of Galt's _Lives of Players_, complained\nthat Mr. Galt had not brought his book\ndown to the date of publication, being\nignorant of the fact that John Galt died\nas long ago as 1839.  The reviewer of\nLamb's _Tales from Shakespeare_ committed\nthe worst blunder of all when he wrote\nthat those persons who did not know\ntheir Shakespeare might read Mr.\nLamb's paraphrase if they liked, but for\nhis part he did not see the use of such\nworks.  The man who had never heard\nof Charles Lamb and his _Tales_ must have\nvery much mistaken his vocation when he\nset up as a literary critic.\n\nThese are all genuine cases, but the\n<p 46>story of Lord Campbell and his criticism\nof _Romeo and Juliet_ is almost too good to\nbe true.  It is said that when the future\nLord Chancellor first came to London\nhe went to the editor of the _Morning\nChronicle_ for some work.  The editor\nsent him to the theatre.  ``Plain John''\nCampbell had no idea he was witnessing\na play of Shakespeare, and he therefore\nset to work to sketch the plot of _Romeo\nand Juliet_, and to give the author a little\nwholesome advice.  He recommended a\ncurtailment in parts so as to render it\nmore suitable to the taste of a cultivated\naudience.  We can quite understand that\nif a story like this was once set into\ncirculation it was not likely to be allowed to\ndie by the many who were glad to have a\nlaugh at the rising barrister.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nBLUNDERS OF TRANSLATORS.\n\nTHE blunders of translators are so\ncommon that they have been\nmade to point a moral in popular\nproverbs.  According to an Italian saying\n_translators are traitors_ (``I traduttori sono\ntraditori''); and books are said to be _done_\ninto English, _traduced_ in French, and _overset_\nin Dutch.  Colton, the author of _Lacon_,\nmentions a half-starved German at Cambridge\nnamed Render, who had been long\nenough in England to forget German, but\nnot long enough to learn English.  This\nworthy, in spite of his deficiencies, was a\nvoluminous translator of his native\nliterature, and it became a proverbial saying\namong his intimates respecting a bad\ntranslation that it was _Rendered_ into\nEnglish.\n\nThe Comte de Tressan translated the\n<p 48>words ``capo basso'' (low headland) in a\npassage from Ariosto by ``Cap de Capo\nBasso,'' on account of which translation\nthe wits insisted upon calling him ``Comte\nde Capo Basso.''\n\nRobert Hall mentions a comical stumble\nmade by one of the translators of Plato,\nwho construed through the Latin and not\ndirect from the Greek.  In the Latin\nversion _hirundo_ stood as _hir<u?>do_, and the\ntranslator, overlooking the mark of\ncontraction, declared to the astonished world\non the authority of Plato that the _horse-\nleech_ instead of the swallow was the harbinger\nof spring.  Hoole, the translator of\nTasso and Ariosto, was as confused in his\nnatural history when he rendered ``I\ncolubri Viscontei'' or _Viscontian snakes_,\nthe crest of the Visconti family, as ``the\nCalabrian Viscounts.''\n\nAs strange as this is the Frenchman's\nnotion of the presence of guns in the\ncanons' seats:  ``L'Archev<e^>que de Cantorbery\navait fait placer des _canons_ dans\nles stalles de la cath<e'>drale.''  He quite\noverlooked the word _chanoines_, which he\nshould have used.  This use of a word\n<p 49>similarly spelt is a constant source of\ntrouble to the translator: for instance,\na French translator of Scott's _Bride of\nLammermuir_ left the first word of the\ntitle untranslated, with the result that he\nmade it the Bridle of Lammermuir, ``La\nBride de Lammermuir.''\n\nThevenot in his travels refers to the\nfables of _Damn<e'> et Calilve_, meaning the\n_Hitopodesa_, or Pilpay's Fables.  His\ntranslator calls them the fables of the damned\nCalilve.  This is on a par with De\nQuincey's specimen of a French Abb<e'>'s\nGreek.  Having to paraphrase the Greek\nwords ``<gr 'Hrodotos kai iaxwn>'' (Herodotus\neven while Ionicizing), the Frenchman\nrendered them ``Herodote et aussi Jazon,''\nthus creating a new author, one Jazon.\nIn the _Present State of Peru_, a compilation\nfrom the _Mercurio Peruano_, P. Geronymo\nRoman de la Higuera is transformed into\n``Father Geronymo, a Romance of La\nHiguera.''\n\nIn Robertson's _History of Scotland_ the\nfollowing passage is quoted from Melville's\n_Account of John Knox_:  ``He was so active\nand vigorous a preacher that he was like\n<p 50>to ding the pulpit into blads and fly out\nof it.''  M. Campenon, the translator of\nRobertson into French, turns this into the\nstartling statement that he broke his pulpit\nand leaped into the midst of his auditors.\nA good companion to this curious ``fact''\nmay be found in the extraordinary trope\nused by a translator of Busbequius, who\nsays ``his misfortunes had reduced him to\nthe top of all miseries.''\n\nWe all know how Victor Hugo transformed\nthe Firth of Forth into the First of\nthe Fourth, and then insisted that he was\nright; but this great novelist was in the\nhabit of soaring far above the realm of\nfact, and in a work he brought out as an\noffering to the memory of Shakespeare he\nshowed that his imagination carried him\nfar away from historical facts.  The author\ncomplains in this book that the muse of\nhistory cares more for the rulers than for\nthe ruled, and, telling only what is pleasant,\nignores the truth when it is unpalatable\nto kings.  After an outburst of bombast\nhe says that no history of England tells us\nthat Charles II. murdered his brother the\nDuke of Gloucester.  We should be sur<p 51>prised\nif any did do so, as that young man\ndied of small-pox.  Hugo, being totally\nignorant of English history, seems to have\nconfused the son of Charles I. with an\nearlier Duke of Gloucester (Richard III.),\nand turned the assassin into the victim.\nAfter these blunders Dr. Baly's mention\nof the cannibals of _Nova Scotia_ instead\nof _New Caledonia_ in his translation of\nM<u:>ller's _Elements of Physiology_ seems\ntame.\n\nOne snare that translators are constantly\nfalling into is the use of English words\nwhich are like the foreign ones, but\nnevertheless are not equivalent terms, and\ntranslations that have taken their place\nin literature often suffer from this cause;\nthus Cicero's _Offices_ should have been\ntranslated _Duties_, and Marmontel never\nintended to write what we understand by\n_Moral Tales_, but rather tales of manners\nor of fashionable life.  The translators of\nCalmet's _Dictionary of the Bible_ render the\nFrench ancien, ancient, and write of ``Mr.\nHuet, the ancient Bishop of Avranch.''\nTheodore Parker, in translating a work by\nDe Wette, makes the blunder of con<p 52>verting\nthe German word _W<a:>lsch_, a\nforeigner (in the book an equivalent for\nItalian), into _Welsh_.\n\nSome men translate works in order to\nlearn a language during the process, and\nthey necessarily make blunders.  It must\nhave been one of these ignoramuses who\ntranslated _tellurische magnetismus_\n(terrestrial magnetism) as the magnetical qualities\nof Tellurium, and by his blunder caused\nan eminent chemist to test tellurium in\norder to find these magnetical qualities.\nThere was more excuse for the French\ntranslator of one of Sir Walter Scott's\nnovels who rendered a welsh rabbit (or\nrarebit, as it is sometimes spelt) into _un\nlapin du pays de Galles_.  Walpole states\nthat the Duchess of Bolton used to divert\nGeorge I. by affecting to make blunders,\nand once when she had been to see Cibber's\nplay of _Love's Last Shift_ she called it _La\nderni<e!>re chemise de l'amour_.  A like\ntranslation of Congreve's _Mourning Bride_ is\ngiven in good faith in the first edition of\nPeignot's _Manuel du Bibliophile_, 1800,\nwhere it is described as _L'<E'>pouse de\nMatin_; and the translation which Walpole\n<p 53>attributes to the Duchess of Bolton the\nFrench say was made by a Frenchman\nnamed La Place.\n\nThe title of the old farce _Hit or Miss_\nwas turned into _Frapp<e'> ou Mademoiselle_,\nand the _Independent Whig_ into _La\nPerruque Ind<e'>pendante_.\n\nIn a late number of the _Literary\nWorld_ the editor, after alluding to the\nFrench translator of Sir Walter Scott\nwho turned ``a sticket minister'' into\n``le ministre assassin<e'>,'' gives from the\n_Biblioth<e!>que Universelle_ the extraordinary\ntranslation of the title of Mr. Barrie's\ncomedy, _Walker, London_, as _Londres qui\nse prom<e!>ne_.\n\nOld translators have played such tricks\nwith proper names as to make them often\nunintelligible; thus we find La Rochefoucauld\nfiguring as Ruchfucove; and in an\nold treatise on the mystery of Freemasonry\nby John Leland, Pythagoras is described\nas Peter Gower the Grecian.  This of\ncourse is an Anglicisation of the French\nPythagore (pronounced like Peter Gore).\nOur versions of Eastern names are so\ndifferent from the originals that when the\n<p 54>two are placed together there appears\nto be no likeness between them, and the\ndifferent positions which they take up in\nthe alphabet cause the bibliographer an\ninfinity of trouble.  Thus the original of\nXerxes is Khshayarsha (the revered king),\nand Averrhoes is Ibn Roshd (son of\nRoshd).  The latter's full name is Abul\nWalid Mohammed ben Ahmed ben Mohammed.\nArtaxerxes is in old Persian\nArtakhshatra, or the Fire Protector, and\nDarius means the Possessor.  Although\nall these names--Xerxes, Artaxerxes, and\nDarius--have a royal significance, they\nwere personal names, and not titles like\nPharaoh.\n\nIt is often difficult to believe that\ntranslators can have taken the trouble to read\ntheir own work, or they surely would not\nlet pass some of the blunders we meet\nwith.  In a translation of Lamartine's\n_Girondins_ some courtly people are\ndescribed as figuring ``under the vaults'' of\nthe Tuileries instead of beneath the arched\ngalleries (_sous ses voutes_).  This, however,\nis nothing to a blunder to be found\nin the _Secret Memoirs of the Court of\n<p 55>Louis XIV. and of the Regency_ (1824).\nThe following passage from the original\nwork, ``Deux en sont morts et on dit\npubliquement qu'ils ont <e'>t<e'> empoisonn<e'>s,'' is\nrendered in the English translation to the\nconfusion of common sense as ``Two of\nthem died with her, and said publicly that\nthey had been poisoned.''\n\nThis is not unlike the bull of the young\nsoldier who, writing home in praise of the\nIndian climate, said, ``But a lot of young\nfellows come out here, and they drink\nand they eat, and they eat and they drink,\nand they die; and then they write home\nto their friends saying it was the climate\nthat did it.''\n\nSome authors have found that there is\nperil in too free a translation, thus Dotet\nwas condemned on Feb. 14th, 1543, for\ntranslating a passage in Plato's Dialogues\nas ``After death you will be nothing _at\nall_.''  Surely he who translated _Dieu d<e'>fend\nl'adult<e!>re_ as _God defends adultery_ more\njustly deserved punishment!  Guthrie,\nthe geographical writer, who translated\na French book of travels, unfortunately\nmistook _neuvi<e!>me_ (ninth) for _neuvelle_ or\n<p 56>_neuve_, and therefore made an allusion to\nthe twenty-sixth day of the new moon.\n\nMoore quotes in his _Diary_ (Dec.\n30th, 1818) a most amusing blunder of\na translator who knew nothing of the\ntechnical name for a breakwater.  He\ntranslated the line in Goldsmith's _Deserted\nVillage_,\n\n ``As ocean sweeps the labour'd mole away,\n\ninto\n\n ``Comme la mer d<e'>truit les travaux de la taupe.''\n\n\nD'Israeli records two comical translations\nfrom English into French.  ``Ainsi\ndouleur, va-t'en ``for _woe begone_ is almost\ntoo good; and the man who mistook the\nexpression ``the officer was broke'' as\nmeaning broke on a wheel and translated\nit by _rou<e'>_ made a very serious matter of\nwhat was possibly but a small fault.\n\nIn the translation of _The Conscript_ by\nErckmann-Chatrian, the old botcher is\nturned into the old butcher.\n\nSometimes in attempting to correct a\nsupposed blunder of another we fall into\n<p 57>a very real one of our own.  Thus a few\nyears ago, before we knew so much about\nfolk-lore as we do now, we should very\nprobably have pointed out that Cinderella's\nglass slipper owed its existence to a\nmisprint.  Fur was formerly so rare and so\nhighly prized that its use was restricted\nby sumptuary laws to kings, princes, and\npersons holding honourable offices.  In\nthese laws sable is called vair, and it has\nbeen asserted that Perrault marked the\ndignity conferred upon Cinderella by the\nfairy's gift of a slipper of vair, a privilege\nconfined to the highest rank of princesses.\nIt is further stated that by an error of the\nprinter _vair_ was changed into _verre_.  Now,\nhowever, we find in the various versions\nwhich have been collected of this favourite\ntale that, however much the incidents may\ndiffer, the slipper is almost invariably made\nof some rigid material, and in the earliest\nforms the unkind sisters cut their feet to\nmake them fit the slipper.  This unpleasant\nincident was omitted by Perrault, but he\nkept the rigid material and made the glass\nslipper famous.\n\nThe Revisers of the Old Testament\n<p 58>translation have shown us that the famous\nverse in Job, ``Oh that mine adversary\nhad written a book,'' is wrong; but it\nwill never drop out of our language\nand literature.  The Revised Version is\ncertainly much more in accordance with\nour ideas of the time when the book was\nwritten, a period when authors could not\nhave been very common:--\n\n ``Oh that I had one to hear me!\n   (Lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me;)\n   And that I had the indictment which mine adversary hath written!\n   Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder;\n   I would bind it unto me as a crown.''\n\n\nSilk Buckingham drew attention to the\nfact that some translations of the Bible\nhad been undertaken by persons ignorant\nof the idioms of the language into which\nthey were translating, and he gave an\ninstance from an Arabic translation where\nthe text ``Judge not, that ye be not\njudged'' was rendered ``Be not just to\nothers, lest others should be just to\nyou.''\n\nThe French have tried ingeniously to\n<p 59>explain the difficulty contained in _St.\nMatthew_ xix. 24, ``It is easier for a camel\nto go through the eye of a needle than\nfor a rich man to enter into the kingdom\nof God,'' by affirming that the translators\nmistook the supposed word <gr k<a'>milos>, a rope,\nfor <gr k<a'>mhlos>, a camel.\n\nThe humours of translation are numerous,\nbut perhaps the most eccentric\nexample is to be found in Stanyhurst's\nrendering of _Virgil_, published in 1583.\nIt is full of cant words, and reads like\nthe work of a madman.  This is a fair\nspecimen of the work:--\n\n ``Theese thre were upbotching, not shapte, but partlye wel onward,\n   A clapping fierbolt (such as oft, with rownce robel-hobble,\n   Jove to the ground clattreth) but yeet not finished holye.''\n\n\nM. Guyot, translating some Latin epigrams\nunder the title of _Fleurs, Morales, et\n<E'>pigrammatiques_, uses the singular forms\nMonsieur Zo<i:>le and Mademoiselle Lycoris.\nThe same author, when translating the\nletters of Cicero (1666), turns Pomponius\ninto M. de Pomponne.\n<p 60>\n\nPitt's friend, Pepper Arden, Master of\nthe Rolls, Lord Chief Justice of the\nCommon Pleas and Lord Alvanley, was\nrather hot-tempered, and his name was\nconsidered somewhat appropriate, but to\nmake it still more so his friends translated\nit into ``Mons. Poivre Ardent.''\n\nThis reminds one of the Frenchman who\ntoasted Dr. Johnson, not as Mr. Rambler,\nbut as Mr. Vagabond.\n\nTom Moore notices some amusing mis-\ntranslations in his _Diary_.  Major\nCartwright, who was called the Father of\nReform (although a wit suggested that\nMother of Reform would have been a\nmore appropriate title), supposed that\nthe _Brevia Parliamentaria_ of Prynne\nstood for ``short parliaments.''  Lord\nLansdowne told Moore that he was with\nLord Holland when the letter containing\nthis precious bit of erudition arrived.\nAnother story of Lord Lansdowne's is\nequally good.  His French servant\nannounced Dr. Mansell, the Master of\nTrinity, when he called, as ``Ma<i^>tre des\nC<e'>r<e'>monies de la Trinit<e'>.''\n\nMoore also relates that an account\n<p 61>having appeared in the London papers\nof a row at the Stock Exchange, where\nsome strangers were hustled, it appeared\nin the Paris papers in this form:  ``Mons.\nStock Exchange <e'>tait <e'>chauff<e'>,'' etc.\n\nThere is something to be said in favour\nof the humorous translation of _Magna est\nveritas et prevalabit_--``Great is truth,\nit will prevail a bit,'' for it is probably\ntruer than the original.  He who construed\nC<ae>sar's mode of passing into Gaul\n_summa diligentia_, ``on the top of the\ndiligence,'' must have been of an imaginative\nturn of mind.  Probably the time will\nsoon come when this will need explanation,\nfor a public will arise which knows\nnot the dilatory ``diligence.''\n\nThe translator of _Inter Calicem\nsupremaque labra_ as Betwixt Dover and\nCalais gave as his reason that Dover was\n_Angli<ae> suprema labra_.\n\nAlthough not a blunder nor apparently\na joke, we may conclude this chapter with\na reference to Shakespeare's remarkable\ntranslation of _Finis Coronat opus_.  Helena\nremarks in _All's well that Ends well_ (act\niv., sc. 4):--\n<p 62>\n``All's well that ends well: still _the fine's the crown_.''\n\n\nIn the _Second Part of King Henry VI_.\n(act v., sc. 2) old Lord Clifford, just before\nhe dies, is made to use the French translation\nof the proverb:--\n\n     ``La fin couronne les <oe>uvres.''\n\nIn the first Folio we read:--\n\n     ``La fin corrone les eumenes.''\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPEIICAL BLUNDERS.\n\nTHERE is no class that requires\nto be dealt with more leniently\nthan do bibliographers, for pitfalls\nare before and behind them.  It is\nimpossible for any one man to see all the\nbooks he describes in a general bibliography;\nand, in consequence of the necessity\nof trusting to second-hand information,\nhe is often led imperceptibly into gross\nerror.  Watt's _Bibliotheca Britannica_ is a\nmost useful and valuable work, but, as\nmay be expected from so comprehensive\na compilation, many mistakes have crept\ninto it: for instance, under the head of\nPhilip Beroaldus, we find the following\ntitle of a work:  ``A short view of the\nPersian Monarchy, published at the end\nof Daniel's Works.''  The mystery of the\nlast part of the title is cleared up when we\n<p 64>find that it should properly be read, ``_and\nof Daniel's Weekes_,'' it being a work on\nprophecy.  The librarian of the old\nMarylebone Institution, knowing as little of\nLatin as the monk did of Hebrew when\nhe described a book as having the beginning\nwhere the end should be, catalogued\nan edition of <AE>sop's Fables as ``<AE>sopiarum's\nPh<oe>dri Fabulorum.''\n\nTwo blunders that a bibliographer is\nvery apt to fall into are the rolling of\ndifferent authors of the same name into\none, and the creation of an author who\nnever existed.  The first kind we may\nillustrate by mentioning the dismay of the\nworthy Bishop Jebb, when he found himself\nidentified in Watt's _Bibliotheca_ with\nhis uncle, the Unitarian writer.  Of the\nsecond kind we might point out the\nnames of men whose lives have been\nwritten and yet who never existed.  In\nthe _Zoological Biography_ of Agassiz,\npublished by the Ray Society, there is an\nimaginary author, by name J. K. Broch,\nwhose work, _Entomologische Briefe_, was\npublished in 1823.  This pamphlet is\nreally anonymous, and was written by\n<p 65>one who signed himself J. K. Broch, is\nmerely an explanation in the catalogue\nfrom which the entry was taken that it\nwas a _brochure_.  Moreri created an author,\nwhom he styled Dorus Basilicus, out of\nthe title of James I.'s <gr D<w^>ron basilik<o'>n>,\nand Bishop Walton supposed the title of\nthe great Arabic Dictionary, the _Kamoos_\nor Ocean, to be the name of an author\nwhom he quotes as ``Camus.''  In the\narticle on Stenography in Rees's Cyclop<ae>dia\nthere are two most amusing blunders.\nJohn Nicolai published a _Treatise on the\nSigns of the Ancients_ at the beginning of\nthe last century, and the writer of the\narticle, having seen it stated that a certain\nfact was to be found in Nicolai, jumped\nto the conclusion that it was the name of\na place, and wrote, ``It was at Nicolai\nthat this method of writing was first\nintroduced to the Greeks by Xenophon\nhimself.''  Tn another part of the same\narticle the oldest method of shorthand\nextant, entitled ``Ars Scribendi Characteris,''\nis said to have been printed about\nthe year 1412--that is, long before printing\nwas invented.  In the _Biographie Univer<p 66>selle_\nthere is a life of one Nicholas Donis,\nby Baron Walckenaer, which is a blundering\nalteration of the real name of a\nBenedictine monk called Dominus Nicholas.\nThis, however, is not the only time that\na title has been taken for a name.  An\neminent bookseller is said to have\nreceived a letter signed George Winton,\nproposing a life of Pitt; but, as he did not\nknow the name, he paid no attention to\nthe letter, and was much astonished when\nhe was afterwards told that his\ncorrespondent was no less a person than\nGeorge Pretyman Tomline, Bishop of\nWinchester.  This is akin to the mistake\nof the Scotch doctor attending on the\nPrincess Charlotte during her illness, who\nsaid that ``ane Jean Saroom'' had been\ncontinually calling, but, not knowing the\nfellow, he had taken no notice of him.\nThus the Bishop of Salisbury was sent\naway by one totally ignorant of his\ndignity.  A similar blunder was made by a\nbibliographer, for in Hotten's _Handbook\nto the Topography and Family History of\nEngland and Wales_ will be found an entry\nof an ``Assize Sermon by Bishop Wigorn,\n<p 67>in the Cathedral at Worcester, 1690.''\nThis was really Bishop Stillingfleet.  There\nis a reverse case of a catalogue made by\na worthy bookseller of the name of William\nLondon, which was long supposed to be\nthe work of Dr. William Juxon, the Bishop\nof London at the time of publication.\nThe entry in the _Biographie Moderne_ of\n``Brigham _le jeune_ ou Brigham Young''\nfurnishes a fine instance of a writer\nsuccumbing to the ever-present temptation\nto be too clever by half.  A somewhat\nsimilar blunder is that of the late Mr.\nDircks.  The first reprint of the Marquis\nof Worcester's _Century of Inventions_ was\nissued by Thomas Payne, the highly\nrespected bookseller of the Mews Gate, in\n1746; but in _Worcesteriana_ (1866) Mr.\nDircks positively asserts that the notorious\nTom Paine was the publisher of it, thus\nignoring the different spelling of the two\nnames.\n\nIn a French book on the invention of\nprinting, the sentence ``Le berceau de\nl'imprimerie'' was misread by a German,\nwho turned Le Berceau into a man{.??}\nD'Israeli tells us that _Mantissa_, the title\n<p 68>of the Appendix to Johnstone's _History\nof Plants_, was taken for the name of an\nauthor by D'Aquin, the French king's\nphysician.  The author of the _Curiosities\nof Literature_ also relates that an Italian\nmisread the description _Enrichi de deux\nlistes_ on the title-page of a French book\nof travels, and, taking it for the author's\nname, alluded to the opinions of\nMons. Enrichi De Deux Listes; but\nreally this seems almost too good to be\ntrue.\n\nIf we searched bibliographical literature\nwe should find a fair crop of authors who\nnever existed; for when once a blunder\nof this kind is set going, it seems to bear\na charmed life.  Mr. Daydon Jackson\nmentions some amusing instances of\nimaginary authors made out of title-pages\nin his _Guide to the Literature of Botany_.\nAn anonymous work of A. Massalongo,\nentitled _Graduale Passagio delle Crittogame\nalle Fanerogame_ (1876), has been entered\nin a German bibliography as written by\nG. Passagio.  In an English list Kelaart's\n_Flora Calpensis: Reminiscences of Gibraltar_\n(1846) appears as the work of a lady--\n<p 69>Christian name, Flora; _surname_, Calpensis.\nIn 1837 a _Botanical-Lexicon_ was published\nby an author who described himself as\n``The Rev. Patrick Keith, Clerk, F.L.S.''\nThis somewhat pedantic form deceived a\nforeign cataloguer, who took Clerk for the\nsurname, and contracted ``Patrick Keith''\ninto the initials P.K.  More inexcusable\nwas the blunder of an American who, in\ndescribing J. E. H. Gordon's work on\n_Electricity_, changed the author's degree\ninto the initials of a collaborator, one\nCantab.  The joint authors were stated\nto be J. E. H. Gordon and B. A. Cantab.\n\nA very amusing, but a quite excusable\nerror, was made by Allibone in his\n_Dictionary of English Literature_, under\nthe heading of Isaac D'Israeli.  He\nnotices new editions of that author's\nworks revised by the Right Hon. the\nChancellor of the Exchequer, of course\nIsaac's son Benjamin, afterwards Prime\nMinister and Earl of Beaconsfield; but\nunfortunately there were two Chancellors\nin 1858, and Allibone chooses the wrong\none, printing, as useful information to the\nreader, that the reviser was Sir George\n<p 70>Cornewall Lewis.  An instance of the\ndanger of inconsiderate explanation will\nbe found in a little book by a German\nlady, Fanny Lewald, entitled _England\nand Schottland_.  The authoress, when in\nLondon, visited the theatre in order to\nsee a play founded on Cooper's novel\n_The Wept of Wish-ton Wish_; and being\nunable to understand the title, she calls\nit the ``Will of the Whiston Wisp,'' which\nshe tells us means an _ignis fatuus_.\n\nA writer in a German paper was led\ninto an amusing blunder by an English\nreview a few years ago.  The reviewer,\nhaving occasion to draw a distinction\nbetween George and Robert Cruikshank,\nspoke of the former as the real Simon\nPure.  The German, not understanding\nthe allusion, gravely told his readers that\nGeorge Cruikshank was a pseudonym,\nthe author's real name being Simon Pure.\nThis seems almost too good to be equalled,\nbut a countryman of our own has blundered\nnearly as grossly.  William Taylor,\nin his _Historic Survey of German Poetry_\n(1830), prints the following absurd\nstatement:  ``Godfred of Berlichingen is one\n<p 71>of the earliest imitations of the Shakspeare\ntragedy which the German school has\nproduced.  It was admirably translated into\nEnglish in 1799 at Edinburg by _William_\nScott, advocate, no doubt the same person\nwho, under the poetical but assumed name\nof _Walter_, has since become the most\nextensively popular of the British writers.''\nThe cause of this mistake we cannot explain,\nbut the reason for it is to be found\nin the fact which has lately been announced\nthat a few copies of the translation, with\nthe misprint of William for Walter in the\ntitle, were issued before the error was\ndiscovered.\n\nJacob Boehm, the theosophist, wrote\nsome Reflections on a theological treatise\nby one Isaiah Stiefel,[6] the title of which\npuzzled one of his modern French\nbiographers.  The word Stiefel in German\nmeans a boot, and the Frenchman therefore\ngave the title of Boehm's tract as\n``Reflexions sur les Bottes d'Isaie.''\n\n\n\n[6] ``Bedencken <u:>ber Esai<ae> Stiefels Buchlein:\nvon dreyerley Zustandt des Menschen unnd dessen\nnewen Geburt.''  1639.\n\n\n\nIt is scarcely fair to make capital out\n<p 72>of the blunders of booksellers' catalogues,\nwhich are often printed in a great hurry,\nand cannot possibly possess the advantage\nof correction which a book does.  But\none or two examples may be given without\nany censure being intended on the\nbooksellers.\n\nIn a French catalogue the works of\nthe famous philosopher Robert Boyle\nappeared under the following singular\nFrench form:  BOY (le), Chymista scepticus\nvel dubia et paradoxa chymico-physica, &c.\n\n``Mr. Tul. Cicero's Epistles'' looks\nstrange, but the mistake is but small.\nThe very natural blunder respecting the\ntitle of Shelley's _Prometheus Unbound_\nactually did occur; and, what is more, it\nwas expected by Theodore Hook.  This is\nan accurate copy of the description in the\ncatalogue of a year or two back:--\n\n``Shelley's Prometheus _Unbound_.\n\n---- another copy, _in whole calf_.''\nand these are Hook's lines:--\n\n ``Shelley styles his new poem `Prometheus Unbound,'\n And 'tis like to remain so while time circles round;\n <p 73>For surely an age would be spent in the finding\n A reader so weak as _to pay for the binding_.''\n\n\nWhen books are classified in a catalogue\nthe compiler must be peculiarly on his\nguard if he has the titles only and not\nthe books before him.  Sometimes instances\nof incorrect classification show\ngross ignorance, as in the instance quoted\nin the _Athen<ae>um_ lately.  Here we have\na crop of blunders:  ``_Title_, Commentarii\nDe Bello Gallico in usum Scholarum\nLiber Tirbius.  _Author_, Mr. C. J.\nCaesoris.  _Subject_, Religion.''  Still better\nis the auctioneer's entry of P. V. Maroni's\n_The Opera_.  Authors, however, are usually\nso fond of fanciful ear-catching titles, that\nevery excuse must be made for the cataloguer,\nwho mistakes their meaning, and\ntakes them in their literal signification.\nWho can reprove too severely the classifier\nwho placed Swinburne's _Under the\nMicroscope_ in his class of _Optical\nInstruments_, or treated Ruskin's _Notes on the\nConstruction of Sheetfolds_ as a work on\nagricultural appliances?  A late instance\nof an amusing misclassification is reported\nfrom Germany.  In the _Orientalische\n<p 74>Bibliographie_, Mr. Rider Haggard's\nwonderful story _King Solomon's Mines_ is\nentered as a contribution to\n``Alttestamentliche Litteratur.''\n\nThe elaborate work by Careme, _Le\nPatissier Pittoresque_ (1842), which\ncontains designs for confectioners, deceived\nthe bookseller from its plates of pavilions,\ntemples, etc., into supposing it to be a\nbook on architecture, and he accordingly\nplaced it under that heading in his\ncatalogue.\n\nMr. Daydon Jackson gives several\ninstances of false classification in his _Guide\nto the Literature of Botany_, and remarks\nthat some authors contrive titles seemingly\nof set purpose to entrap the unwary.  He\ninstances a fine example in the case of\nBishop Alexander Ewing's _Feamainn\nEarraghaidhiell: Argyllshire Seaweeds_\n(Glasgow, 1872. 8vo).  To enhance the\ndelusion, the coloured wrapper is\nornamented with some of the common marine\nalg<ae>, but the inside of the volume\nconsists solely of pastoral addresses.  Another\nexample will be found in _Flowers from\nthe South, from the Hortus Siccus of an\n<p 75>Old Collector_.  By W. H. Hyett, F.R.S.\nInstead of a popular work on the\nMediterranean flora by a scientific man, as\nmight reasonably be expected, this is a\nvolume of translations from the Italian\nand Latin poets.  It is scarcely fair to\nblame the compiler of the _Bibliotheca\nHistorio-Naturalis_ for having ranked\nboth these works among scientific treatises.\nThe English cataloguer who treated as a\nbotanical book Dr. Garnett's selection\nfrom Coventry Patmore's poems, entitled\n_Florilegium Amantis_, could claim less\nexcuse for his blunder than the German\nhad.  These misleading titles are no new\ninvention, and the great bibliographer\nHaller was deceived into including the\ntitle of James Howell's _Dendrologia, or\nDodona's Grove_ (1640), in his _Bibliotheca\nBotanica_.  Professor Otis H. Robinson\ncontributed a very interesting paper on the\n``Titles of Books'' to the _Special Report\non Public Libraries in the United States of\nAmerica_ (1876), in which he deals very\nfully with this difficulty of misleading titles,\nand some of his preliminary remarks are\nvery much to the point.  He writes:--\n<p 76>\n\n``No act of a man's life requires\nmore practical common sense than the\nnaming of his book.  If he would make\na grocer's sign or an invoice of a cellar\nof goods or a city directory, he uses no\nmetaphors; his pen does not hesitate for\nthe plainest word.  He must make himself\nunderstood by common men.  But\nif he makes a book the case is different.\nIt must have the charm of a pleasing\ntitle.  If there is nothing new within, the\nback at least must be novel and taking.\nHe tortures his imagination for something\nwhich will predispose the reader in its\nfavour.  Mr. Parker writes a series of\nbiographical sketches, and calls it _Morning\nStars of the New World_.  Somebody prepares\nseven religious essays, binds them\nup in a book, and calls it _Seven Stormy\nSundays_.  Mr. H. T. Tuckerman makes\na book of essays on various subjects, and\ncalls it _The Optimist_; and then devotes\nseveral pages of preface to an argument,\nlexicon in hand, proving that the\napplicability of the term optimist is `obvious.'\nAn editor, at intervals of leisure, indulges\nhis true poetic taste for the pleasure of his\n<p 77>friends, or the entertainment of an\noccasional audience.  Then his book appears,\nentitled not _Miscellaneous Poems_, but\n_Asleep in the Sanctum_, by A. A. Hopkins.\nSometimes, not satisfied with one enigma,\nanother is added.  Here we have _The\nGreat Iron Wheel; or, Republicanism\nBackwards and Christianity Reversed_, by J. R.\nGraves.  These titles are neither new nor\nscarce, nor limited to any particular class\nof books.  Every case, almost every shelf,\nin every library contain such.  They are as\nold as the art of book-making.  David's\nlamentation over Saul and Jonathan was\ncalled _The Bow_.  A single word in the\npoem probably suggested the name.  Three\nof the orations of <AE>schines were styled _The\nGraces_, and his letters _The Muses_.''\n\nThe list of bibliographical blunders\nmight be indefinitely extended, but the\nsubject is somewhat technical, and the\nabove few instances will give a sufficient\nindication of the pitfalls which lie in the\nway of the bibliographer--a worker who\nneeds universal knowledge if he is to\nwend his way safely through the snares\nin his path.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nLISTS OF ERRATA.\n\nTHE errata of the early printed\nbooks are not numerous, and\nthis fact is easily accounted for\nwhen we recollect that these books were\nsuperintended in their passage through\nthe press by scholars such as the Alduses,\nAndreas, Bishop of Aleria, Campanus\nPerottus, the Stephenses, and others.\nIt is said that the first book with a printed\nerrata is the edition of _Juvenal_, with notes\nof Merula, printed by Gabriel Pierre, at\nVenice, in 1478; previously the mistakes\nhad been corrected by the pen.  One of\nthe longest lists of errata on record, which\noccupies fifteen folio pages, is in the\nedition of the works of Picus of Mirandula,\nprinted by Knoblauch, at Strasburg,\nin 1507.  A worse case of blundering will\nbe found in a little book of only one\n<p 79>hundred and seventy-two pages, entitled\n_Miss<ae> ac Missalis Anatomia_, 1561,\nwhich contains fifteen pages of errata.\nThe author, feeling that such a gross case\nof blundering required some excuse or\nexplanation, accounted for the misprints\nby asserting that the devil drenched\nthe manuscript in the kennel, making it\nalmost illegible, and then obliged the\nprinter to misread it.  We may be allowed\nto believe that the fiend who did all the\nmischief was the printer's ``devil.''\n\nCardinal Bellarmin tried hard to get\nhis works printed correctly, but without\nsuccess, and in 1608 he was forced to\npublish at Ingolstadt a volume entitled\n_Recognitio librorum omnium Roberti\nBelarmini_, in which he printed eighty-eight\npages of errata of his Controversies.\n\nEdward Leigh, in his thin folio volume\nentitled _On Religion and Learning_, 1656,\nwas forced to add two closely printed\nleaves of errata.\n\nSometimes apparent blunders have been\nintentionally made; thus, to escape the\ndecree of the Inquisition that the words\nfatum and fata should not be used in\n<p 80>any work, a certain author printed _facta_\nin his book, and added in the errata ``_for_\nfacta _read_ fata.''\n\nIn dealing with our own older literature\nwe find a considerable difference in degree\nof typographical correctness; thus the old\nplays of the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies are often marvels of inaccuracy,\nand while books of the same date are\nusually supplied with tables of errata,\nplays were issued without any such helps\nto correction.  This to some extent is to\nbe accounted for by the fact that many of\nthese plays were surreptitious publications,\nor, at all events, printed in a hurry, without\ncare.  The late Mr. Halliwell Phillipps, in\nhis curious privately printed volume (_A\nDictionary of Misprints_, 1887), writes:\n``Such tests were really a thousandfold\nmore necessary in editions of plays, but\nthey are practically non-existent in the\nlatter, the brief one which is prefixed\nto Dekker's _Satiro-Mastix_, 1602, being\nnearly the only example that is to be\nfound in any that appeared during the\nliterary career of the great dramatist.''\n\nIn other branches of literature it is\n<p 81>evident that some care was taken to escape\nmisprints, either by the correction of the\nprinter's reader or of the author.  Some\nof the excuses made for misprints in our\nold books are very amusing.  In a little\nEnglish book of twenty-six leaves printed\nat Douay in 1582, and entitled _A true\nreporte of the death and martyrdome of\nM. Campion Jesuite and Preiste, and M.\nSherwin and M. Bryan Preistes, at Tiborne\nthe first of December_ 1581, is this notice\nat the end:--\n\n``Good reader, pardon all faultes escaped\nin the printing and beare with the\nwoorkmanship of a strainger.''\n\nMany of Nicholas Breton's tracts were\nissued surreptitiously, and he protested\nthat many pieces which he had never\nwritten were falsely ascribed to him.  _The\nBower of Delights_ was published without\nthe author's sanction, and the printer\n(or publisher) Richard Jones made the\nfollowing address ``to the Gentlemen\nReaders'' on the blunders which had\nbeen made in the book:--\n\n``Pardon mee (good Gentlemen) of my\npresumption, & protect me, I pray you,<p 82>\nagainst those Cavellers and findfaults, that\nnever like of any thing that they see\nprinted, though it be never so well\ncompiled.  And where you happen to find\nfault, impute it to bee committed by the\nPrinters negligence, then (otherwise) by\nany ignorance in the author: and\nespecially in A 3, about the middest of\nthe page, for LIME OR LEAD I pray you\nread LINE OR LEAD.  So shall your poore\nPrinter haue just cause hereafter to be\nmore carefull, and acknowledge himselfe\nmost bounden (at all times) to do your\nservice to the utmost of his power.\n               ``Yours R. J., PRINTER.''\n\n\nA little scientific book, entitled _The\nMaking and use of the Geometricall Instrument\ncalled a Sector .  .  .  by Thomas Hood_,\n1598, has a list of errata headed _Faultes\nescaped_, with this note of the author\nor printer:--\n\n``Gentle reader, I pray you excuse\nthese faults, because I finde by experience,\nthat it is an harder matter to\nprint these mathematicall books trew,\nthen bookes of other discourse.''\n<p 83>\n\nArthur Hopton's _Baculum Geod<ae>ticum\nsive Viaticum or the Geodeticall Staffe_\n(1610), contains the following quaint lines\nat the head of the list of errata:--\n\n          ``The Printer to the Reader.\n ``For errours past or faults that scaped be,\n     Let this collection give content to thee:\n A worke of art, the grounds to us unknowne,\n     May cause us erre, thoughe all our skill be showne.\n When points and letters, doe containe the sence,\n     The wise may halt, yet doe no great offence.\n Then pardon here, such faults that do befall,\n     The next edition makes amends for all.''\n\n\nThomas Heywood, the voluminous dramatist,\nadded to his _Apology for Actors_\n(1612) an interesting address to the\nprinter of his tract, which, besides drawing\nattention to the printer's dislike of his\nerrors being called attention to in a table\nof errata, is singularly valuable for its\nreference to Shakespeare's annoyance at\nJaggard's treatment of him by attributing\nto his pen Heywood's poems from _Great\nBritain's Troy_.\n\n          ``To my approved good Friend,\n               ``MR. NICHOLAS OKES.\n     ``The infinite faults escaped in my<p 84>\nbooke of _Britaines Troy_ by the negligence\nof the printer, as the misquotations,\nmistaking the sillables, misplacing halfe lines,\ncoining of strange and never heard of\nwords, these being without number, when\nI would have taken a particular account\nof the _errata_, the printer answered me, hee\nwould not publish his owne disworkemanship,\nbut rather let his owne fault lye\nupon the necke of the author.  And being\nfearefull that others of his quality had\nbeene of the same nature and condition,\nand finding you, on the contrary, so\ncarefull and industrious, so serious and\nlaborious to doe the author all the rights\nof the presse, I could not choose but\ngratulate your honest indeavours with\nthis short remembrance.  Here, likewise,\nI must necessarily insert a manifest injury\ndone me in that worke, by taking the\ntwo epistles of Paris to Helen, and Helen\nto Paris, and printing them in a lesse\nvolume under the name of another, which\nmay put the world in opinion I might\nsteale them from him, and hee, to doe\nhimselfe right, hath since published them\nin his owne name; but as I must\nac<p 85>knowledge my lines not worthy his\npatronage under whom he hath publisht\nthem, so the author, I know, much offended\nwith M.

These and the like dishonesties\nI knowe you to bee cleere of; and I could\nwish but to bee the happy author of so\nworthy a worke as I could willingly commit\nto your care and workmanship.\n          ``Yours ever, THOMAS HEYWOOD.''\n\n\nIn the eighteenth century printers and\nauthors had become hardened in their\nsins, and seldom made excuses for the\nerrors of the press, but in the seventeenth\ncentury explanations were frequent.\n\nSilvanus Morgan, in his _Horologiographia\nOptica.  Dialling Universall and\nParticular, Speculative and Practicall,\nLondon_ 1652, comes before his readers\nwith these remarks on the errata:--\n\n\n``Reader I having writ this some years\nsince, while I was a childe in Art, and by\nthis appear to be little more, for want of\na review hath these faults, which I desire\nthee to mend with thy pen, and if there\n<p 86>be any errour in art, as in chap. 17\nwhich is only true at the time of the\nEquinoctiall, take that for an oversight,\nand where thou findest equilibra read\nequilibrio, and in the dedication (in some\ncopies) read Robert Bateman for Thomas,\nand side for signe and know that _Optima\nprima cadunt, pessimus <ae>ve manent_.''\n\nThe list of errata in Joseph Glanvill's\n_Essays on several important subjects in\nPhilosophy and Religion_ (1676) is prefixed\nby this note:--\n\n``The Reader is desired to take notice\nof the following Errours of the Press, some\nof which are so near in sound, to the\nwords of the author, that they may easily\nbe mistaken for his.''\n\nThe next two books to be mentioned\nwere published in the same year--1679.\nThe noble author referred to in the first is\nthat Roger Palmer who had the dishonour\nof being the husband of Charles II.'s\nnotorious mistress, the Countess of\nCastlemaine.  Fortunately for the Earl she no\nlonger bore his name, as she was created\nDuchess of Cleveland in 1670.  Professor\nDe Morgan was inclined to doubt Lord\n<p 87>Castlemaine's authorship, but the following\nremarks by Joseph Moxon seem to prove\nthat the peer did produce a rough draft of\nsome kind:--\n\n``Postscript concerning the Erratas and\nthe Geographical part of this Globe,''\nprefixed to _The English Globe_ . . . by\nthe Earl of Castlemaine:--\n\n``The Erratas of the Press being many,\nI shall not set them down in a distinct\nCatalogue as usually, least the sight of them\nshould more displease, than the particulars\nadvantage, especially since they are not so\nmaterial or intricate, but that any man may\n(I hope) easily mend them in the reading.\nI confess I have bin in a manner the occasion\nof them, by taking from the noble\nauthor a very foul copy, when he desir'd\nme to stay till a fair one were written over,\nso that truly 'tis no wonder, if workmen\nshould in these cases not only sometimes\nleave out, but adde also, by taking one line\nfor another, or not observing with exactness\nwhat words have bin wholly obliterated\nor dasht out.''\n\nJohn Playford, the music publisher\nand author, makes some remarks on the\n<p 88>subject of misprints in the preface to\nhis _Vade Mecum, or the Necessary Companion_\n(1679), which are worth quotation\nhere:--\n\n``My profession obliging me to be\nconversant with mathematical Books (the\nprinting whereof and musick, has been\nmy chiefest employment), I have observ'd\ntwo things many times the cause why\nBooks of this nature appear abroad not\nso correct as they should be; either 1\nBecause they are too much hastened from\nthe Press, and not time enough allowed\nfor the strict and deliberate examination\nof them; which in all books ought to be\ndone, especially in these, for as much as\none false figure in a Mathematical book,\nmay prove a greater fault than a whole\nword mistake in books of another kind.\nOr, 2 Because Persons take Tables upon\ntrust without trying them, and with them\ntranscribe their errors, if not increase\nthem.  Both these I have carefully avoided,\nso that I have reason to believe (and think\nI may say it without vanity) there never\nwas Tables more exactly printed than in\nthis Book, especially those for money and\n<p 89>annuities, for not trusting to my first\ncalculation of them, I new calculated every\nTable when it was in print, by the first\nprinted sheet, and when I had so done\nI strictly compared it with my first calculation.''\n\nDe Morgan registers the nineteenth\nedition of this book, dated 1756, in his\n_Arithmetical Books_, and he did not apparently\nknow that it was originally published\nso early as 1679.\n\nIn Morton's _Natural History of\nNorthamptonshire_ (1712), is a list headed ``Some\nErrata of the press to be corrected''; and\nat the end of the list is the following\namusing note:  ``There is no cut of the\nHen of the lesser Py'd Brambling in Tab.\n13 tho' 'tis referred to in p. 423 which\nomission was owing to an accident and is\nreally not very material, the hen of that\nbird differing but little from the cock\nwhich is represented in that Table under\nfig. 3.''\n\nThere is a very prevalent notion that\nauthors did not correct the proofs of their\nbooks in the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies, but there is sufficient evidence\n<p 90>that this is altogether a mistake.  Professor\nDe Morgan, with his usual sagacity, alludes\nto this point in his _Arithmetical Books_\n(1847):  ``A great many circumstances induce\nme to think that the general fashion\nof correcting the press by the author came\nin with the seventeenth century or\nthereabouts.''  And he instances this note on\nthe title-page of Richard Witt's _Arithmetical\nQuestions_ (1613):  ``Examined also\nand corrected at the Presse by the author\nhimselfe.''\n\nThe late Dr. Brinsley Nicholson raised\nthis question in _Notes and Queries_ in 1889,\nand by his research it is possible to\nantedate the practice by nearly forty years.\nFor several of the following quotations I\nam indebted to that invaluable periodical.\nIn Scot's _Hop-Garden_ (1574) we find the\nfollowing excuse:--\n\n``Forasmuch as M. Scot could not\nbe present at the printing of this his\nbooke, whereby I might have used his\nadvice in the correction of the same, and\nespeciallie of the Figures and Portratures\nconteyned therein, whereof he\ndelivered unto me such notes as I\n<p 91>being unskilfull in the matter could\nnot so thoroughly conceyve, nor so\nperfectly expresse as . . . the authour\nor you.''\n\nIn _The Droomme of Doomes Day_.  By\nGeorge Gascoigne (1576) is:--\n\n\n``An Aduertisement of the Prynter to the Reader.\n\n\n``Understand (gentle Reader) that whiles\nthis worke was in the presse it pleased\nGod to visit the translatour thereof with\nsicknesse.  So that being unable himselfe\nto attend the dayly proofes, he apoynted\na seruaunt of his to ouersee the same.\nWho being not so well acquainted with\nthe matter as his maister was, there haue\npassed some faultes much contrary unto\nboth our meanings and desires.  The which\nI have therefore collected into this Table.\nDesiring every Reader that wyll vouchsafe\nto peruse this booke, that he will firste\ncorrect those faultes and then judge accordingly.''\n\nA particularly interesting note on this\npoint precedes the list of errata in Stanyhurst's\nTranslation of Virgil's _<AE>neid_ (1582),\n<p 92>which was printed at Leyden.  Mr. F. C.\nBirkbeck Terry, who pointed this out in\n_Notes and Queries_, quoted from Arber's\nreprint, p. 157:--\n\n``John Pates Printer to thee Corteous\nReader, I am too craue thy pacience and\npaynes (good reader) in bearing wyth such\nfaultes as haue escapte in printing: and\nin correcting as wel such as are layd downe\nheere too thy view, as all oother whereat\nthou shalt hap too stumble in perusing\nthis treatise.  Thee nooueltye of imprinting\nEnglish in theese partes and thee absence\nof the author from perusing soome proofes\ncould not choose but breede errours.''\n\nCertainly Scot, Gascoigne, and Stanyhurst\ndid not correct the proofs, but it\nwould not have been necessary to make\nan excuse if the practice was not a pretty\ngeneral one among authors.\n\nBishop Babington's _Exposition of the\nLord's Prayer_ (1588) contains an excuse\nfor the author's inability to correct the\npress:--\n\n``If thou findest any other faultes either\nin words or distinctions troubling a perfect\nsence (Gentle Reader) helpe them by thine\n<p 93>owne judgement and excuse the presse by\nthe Authors absence, who best was acquainted\nto reade his owne hande.''\n\nIn the Bobleian Library is preserved\nthe printer's copy of Book V. of Hooker's\n_Ecclesiastical Polity_ (1597), with Whitgift's\nsignature and corrections in Hooker's\nhandwriting.  On one of the pages is the\nfollowing note by the printer:--\n\n``Good Mr. Hooker, I pray you be so\ngood as to send us the next leaf that\nfolloweth this, for I know not by what\nmischance this of ours is lost, which\nstandeth uppon the finishing of the\nbook.''[7]\n\n\n     [7] _Notes and Queries_, 7th Series, viii. 73.\n\n\n\nAnother proof of the general practice\nwill be found in N. Breton's _The Wit of\nWit_ (1599):--\n\n``What faultes are escaped in the printing,\nfinde by discretion, and excuse the\nAuthor by other worke that let him from\nattendance to the Presse; non h<a!> che non\ns<a!>.         N. B. Gent.''\n\nAt the end of Nash's dedication ``To\nhis Readers,'' _Lenten Stuffe_ (1599), is this\n<p 94>interesting statement:  ``Apply it for me\nfor I am called away to correct the faults\nof the press, that escaped in my absence\nfrom the printing house.''\n\nRichard Brathwaite, when publishing\nhis _Strappado for the Divell_ (1615), made\nan excuse for not having seen all the\nproofs.  The whole note is well worthy\nof reproduction:--\n\n               ``Upon the Errata.\n\n\n``Gentlemen (_humanum est errare_), to\nconfirme which position, this my booke\n(as many other are) hath his share of\nerrors; so as I run _ad pr<ae>lum tanquam\nad pr<ae>lium, in typos quasi in scippos_; but\nmy comfort is if I be strappadoed by the\nmultiplicite of my errors, it is but\nanswerable to my title: so as I may seem to\ndiuine by my style, what I was to indure\nby the presse.  Yet know judicious disposed\ngentlemen, that the intricacie of the\ncopie, and the absence of the author from\nmany important proofes were occasion of\nthese errors, which defects (if they bee\nsupplied by your generous convenience\nand curtuous disposition) I doe vowe to\n<p 95>satisfie your affectionate care with a\nmore serious surueigh in my next\nimpression. . . .  For other errors as the\nmisplacing of commaes, colons, and\nperiods (which as they are in euerie\npage obvious, so many times they invert\nthe sence), I referre to your discretion\n(judicious gentle-men) whose lenity may\nsooner supply them, then all my industry\ncan portray them.''\n\nIn _The Mastive, or Young Whelpe of\nthe Olde Dogge, Epigrams and Satyres\n_(1615), an anonymous work of Henry\nPeacham, we read:--\n\n``The faultes escaped in the Printing\n(or any other omission) are to be excused\nby reason of the authors absence from the\nPresse, who thereto should have given\nmore due instructions.''\n\nDr. Brinsley Nicholson brought forward\ntwo very interesting passages on the\ncorrecting of proofs from old plays.  The\nfirst, which looks very like an allusion to\nthe custom, is from the 1601 edition of\nBen Jonson's _Every Man in his Humour_\n(act. ii., sc. 3), where Lorenzo, junior,\nsays, ``My father had the proving of your\n<p 96>copy, some houre before I saw it.''  The\nsecond is from Fletcher's _The Nice Valour_\n(1624 or 1625), act. iv., sc. 1.  Lapet\nsays to his servant (the clown Goloshio),\n``So bring me the last proof, this is\ncorrected''; and Goloshio having gone\nand returned, the following ensues:--\n\n     _Lap_.    What says my Printer now?\n     _Clown_.  Here's your last Proof, Sir.\n               You shall have perfect Books now in a twinkling.[8]\n\n\n     [8]2 _Notes and Queries_, 7th Series, viii. 253.\n\n\n\nThe following address, which contains\na curious excuse of Dr. Daniel Featley for\nnot having corrected the proofs of his\nbook _The Romish Fisher Caught in his own\nNet_ (1624), is very much to the point:--\n\n``I entreat the courteous reader to\nunderstand that the greater part of the\nbook was printed in the time of the great\nfrost; when by reason that the Thames\nwas shut up, I could not conveniently\nprocure the proofs to be brought unto\nmee, before they were wrought off; whereupon\nit fell out that many very grosse\nescapes passed the press, and (which was\n<p 97>the worst fault of all) the third part is left\nunpaged.''\n\nAs a later example we may cite from\nSir Peter Leycester's _Historical Antiquities_\n(1673), where we find this note:  ``Reader,\nBy reason of the author's absence, several\nfaults have escaped the press: those which\nare the most material thou art desir'd to\namend, and to pardon them all.''\n\nPrinted mistakes are usually considered\nby the sufferers matters of somewhat\nserious importance; and we picture to\nourselves an author stalking up and down\nhis room and tearing his hair when\nhe first discovers them; but Benserade,\nthe French poet, was able to make a joke\nof the subject.  This is the _rondeau_ which\nhe placed at the end of his version of _Les\nMetamorphoses d'Ovide_:--\n\n ``Pour moi, parmi des fautes innombrables,\n   Je n'en connais que deux consid<e'>rables,\n   Et dont je fais ma d<e'>claration,\n   C'est l'entreprise et l'ex<e'>cution;\n   A mon avis fautes irr<e'>parables\n   Dans ce volume.''\n\n\nAccording to the _Scaligerana_, Cardan's\ntreatise _De Subtilitate_, printed by Vascosan\n<p 98>in 1557, does not contain a single\nmisprint; but, on the whole, it may be very\nseriously doubted whether an immaculate\nedition of any work ever issued from the\npress.  The story is well known of the\nserious attempt made by the celebrated\nGlasgow printers Foulis to free their edition\nof _Horace_ from any chance of error.  They\ncaused the proof-sheets after revision to\nbe hung up at the gate of the University,\nwith the offer of a reward to any one who\ndiscovered a misprint.  In spite of all this\ncare there are, according to Dibdin, six\nuncorrected errors in this edition.\n\nAccording to Isaac Disraeli, the goal\nof freedom from blunders was nearly\nreached by Dom Joze Souza, with the\nassistance of Didot in 1817, when he\npublished his magnificent edition of _As\nLusiadas_ of Camoens.  However, an\nuncorrected error was discovered in some\ncopies, occasioned by the misplacing of\none of the letters in the word _Lusitano_.\nA like case occurred a few years ago at an\neminent London printer's.  A certain book\nwas about to be printed, and instructions\nwere issued that special care was to be\n<p 99>taken with the printing.  It was read over\nby the chief reader, and all seemed to\nhave gone well, when a mistake was discovered\nupon the title-page.\n\nIt may be mentioned here, with respect\nto tables of errata, that they are frequently\nneglected in subsequent books.  There are\nmany books in which the same blunders\nhave been repeated in various editions,\nalthough they had been pointed out in an\nearly issue.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nMISPRINTS.\n\nOF all literary blunders misprints\nare the most numerous, and no\none who is conversant with the\ninside of a printing-office will be surprised\nat this; in fact, he is more likely to be\nstruck with the freedom from error of the\ninnumerable productions issued from the\npress than to be surprised at the blunders\nwhich he may come across.  The possibilities\nof error are endless, and a frequent\ncause is to be found in the final correction,\nwhen a line may easily get transposed.\nOn this account many authors will prefer\nto leave a trivial error, such as a wrong\nstop, in a final revise rather than risk the\npossibilities of blundering caused by the\nunlocking of the type.  Of course a large\nnumber of misprints are far from amusing,\nwhile a sense of fun will sometimes be\n<p 101>obtained by a trifling transposition of\nletters.  Authors must be on the alert for\nmisprints, although ordinary misspellings\nshould not be left for them by the printer's\nreader; but they are usually too intent on\nthe structure of their own sentences to\nnotice these misprints.  The curious point\nis that a misprint which has passed through\nproof and revise unnoticed by reader and\nauthor will often be detected immediately\nthe perfected book is placed in the author's\nhands.  The blunder which has hitherto\nremained hidden appears to start out from\nthe page, to the author's great disgust.\nOne reason why misprints are overlooked\nis that every word is a sort of pictorial\nobject to the eye.  We do not spell the\nword, but we guess what it is by the first\nand last letters and its length, so that a\nwrong letter in the body of the word is\neasily overlooked.\n\nIt is an important help to the editor of\na corrupt text to know what misprints are\nthe most probable, and for this purpose\nthe late Mr. Halliwell Phillipps printed\nfor private circulation _A Dictionary of\nMisprints, found in printed books of the\n<p 102>sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, compiled\nfor the use of verbal critics and especially\nfor those who are engaged in editing the\nworks of Shakespeare and our other early\nDramatists_ (1887).  In the note at the\nend of this book Mr. Phillipps writes:\n``The readiest access to those evidences\nwill be found in the old errata, and it will\nbe seen, on an examination of the latter,\nthat misprints are abundant in final and\ninitial letters, in omissions, in numerals,\nand in verbal transpositions; but\nunquestionably the most frequent in pronouns,\narticles, conjunctions, and prepositions.\nWhen we come to words outside the\nfour latter, there is a large proportion of\nexamples that are either of rare occurrence\nor unique.  Some of the blunders that are\nrecorded are sufficiently grotesque: _e.g.,\nIle starte thence poore for Ile starve their\npoore,--he formaketh what for the fire\nmaketh hot_.  It must, indeed, be confessed\nthat the conjectural emendator, if he\ndispenses with the quasi-authority of\ncontemporary precedents, has an all but\nunlimited range for the exercise of his\ningenuity, the unsettled spellings of our\n<p 103>ancestors rendering almost any\nemendation, however extravagant, a typographical\npossibility.  A large number of their\nmisprints could only have been perpetrated\nin the midst of the old orthographies.\nUnder no other conditions could _ice_ have\nbeen converted into _ye_, _air_ into _time_, _home_\ninto _honey_, _attain_ into _at any_, _sun_ into\n_sinner_, _stone_ into _story_, _deem_ into _deny_,\n_dire_ into _dry_, the old spellings of the\nitalicised words being respectively, yce,\nyee, ayre, tyme, home, honie, attaine, att\nanie, sunne, sinner, stone, storie, deeme,\ndenie, dire, drie.  The form of the long _s_\nshould also be sometimes taken into\nconsideration, for it could only have been\nowing to its use that such a word as _some_\ncould have been misprinted _four, niece_ for\n_wife, prefer_ for _preserve, find_ for _fifth_, the\nvariant old spellings being foure, neese,\npreferre.''\n\nAmong the instances of misprints given\nin this Dictionary may be noticed the\nfollowing: actions _for_ axioms, agreement\n_for_ argument, all-eyes _for_ allies, aloud _for_\nallowed, banish'd _for_ ravish'd, cancel _for_\ncantel, candle _for_ caudle, culsedness\n<p 104>_for_ ourselves, eye-sores _for_ oysters, felicity\n_for_ facility, Hector _for_ nectar, intending\n_for_ indenting, John _for_ Jehu, Judges _for_\nIndies, scene _for_ seene, sixteen _for_ sexton,\nand _for_ sixty-one, tops _for_ toy, Venus\n_for_ Venice.\n\nIn connection with this work may be\nmentioned the late Mr. W. Blades's\n_Shakspere and Typography, being an\nattempt to show Shakspere's personal\nconnection with, and technical knowledge of\nthe Art of Printing, also Remarks upon\nsome common typographical errors with\nespecial reference to the text of Shakspere_\n(1872), a small work of very great interest\nand value.  Mr. Blades writes:  ``Now\nthese typographical blunders will, in the\nmajority of cases, be found to fall into\none of three classes, viz.:--\n\n``Errors of the ear;\n\n``Errors of the eye; and\n\n``Errors from what, in printers' language,\nis called `a foul case.'\n\n``I. _Errors of the Ear_.--Every compositor\nwhen at work reads over a few\nwords of his copy, and retains them in\nhis mind until his fingers have picked\n<p 105>up the various types belonging to them.\nWhile the memory is thus repeating to\nitself a phrase, it is by no means\nunnatural, nor in practice is it uncommon,\nfor some word or words to become\nunwittingly supplanted in the mind by others\nwhich are similar in sound.  It was simply\na mental transposition of syllables that\nmade the actor exclaim,--\n\n\n`My Lord, stand back and let the parson cough '\n\ninstead of\n\n\n`My Lord, stand back and let the coffin pass'\n                              _Richard III_., i. 2.\n\nAnd, by a slight confusion of sound, the\nword _mistake_ might appear in type as\nmust take:--\n\n\n`So you mistake your husbands.'\n                              _Hamlet_, iii. 2.\n\nAgain, _idle votarist_ would easily become\n_idol votarist_--\n\n\n`I am no idle votarist.'--_Timon_, iv. 3;\n\nand _long delays_ become transformed to\n_longer days_--\n\n\n`This done, see that you take no long delays.\n                              _Titus_, iv. 2.\n\n<p 106>From the time of Gutenberg until now\nthis similarity of sound has been a fruitful\nsource of error among printers.\n\n``II. _Errors of the Eye_.--The eye often\nmisleads the hand of the compositor,\nespecially if he be at work upon a crabbed\nmanuscript or worn-out reprint.  Take\nout a dot, and _This time goes manly_\nbecomes\n\n\n`This tune goes manly.' _Macbeth_, iv. 3.\n\nSo a clogged letter turns _What beast was't\nthen_? into _What boast was't then_?--\n\n     `Lady M.       What beast was't then,\n     That made you break this enterprise to me?'\n                                   _Macbeth_, i. 7.\n\nExamples might be indefinitely multiplied\nfrom many an old book, so I will quote\nbut one more instance.  The word _preserve_\nspelt with a long _s_ might without\nmuch carelessness be misread _preferre_\n(I _Henry VI_., iii. 2), and thus entirely\nalter the sense.\n\n``III. _Errors from a `foul case_.'--This\nclass of errors is of an entirely different\n<p 107>kind from the two former.  They came\nfrom within the man, and were from the\nbrain; this is from without, mechanical in\nits origin as well as in its commission.  As\nmany readers may never have seen the\ninside of a printing office, the following\nshort explanation may be found useful:\nA `case' is a shallow wooden drawer,\ndivided into numerous square receptacles\ncalled `boxes,' and into each box is put\none sort of letter only, say all _a_'s, or _b_'s,\nor _c_'s.  The compositor works with two of\nthese cases slanting up in front of him,\nand when, from a shake, a slip, or any\nother accident, the letters become\nmisplaced the result is technically known as\n`a foul case.'  A further result is, that the\nfingers of the workman, although going to\nthe proper box, will often pick up a wrong\nletter, he being entirely unconscious the\nwhile of the fact.\n\n``Now, if we can discover any law which\ngoverns this abnormal position of the types\n--if, for instance, we can predicate that the\nletter _o_, when away from its own, will be\nmore frequently found in the box appropriated\nto letter _a_ than any other; that _b_\n<p 108>has a general tendency to visit the _l_ box,\nand _l_ the _v_ box; and that _d_, if away\nfrom home, will be almost certainly found\namong the _n_'s; if we can show this, we\nshall then lay a good foundation for the\nre-examination of many corrupt or disputed\nreadings in the text of Shakspere,\nsome of which may receive fresh life from\nsuch a treatment.\n\n``To start with, let us obtain a definite\nidea of the arrangement of the types in\nboth `upper' and `lower' case in the\ntime of Shakspere--a time when long _s_'s,\nwith the logotypes _ct_, _ff_, _fi_, _ffi_, _ffl_, _sb_, _sh_,\n_si_, _sl_, _ss_, _ssi_, _ssl_, and others, were in daily\nuse.''\n\nMr. Blades then refers to Moxon's\n_Mechanical Exercises_, 1683, which contains\na representation of the compositors'\ncases in the seventeenth century, which\nmay be presumed to be the same in form\nas those used in Shakespeare's day.\nVarious alterations have been made in\nthe arrangement of the cases, with the\nobject of placing the letters more\nconveniently.  The present form is shown\non pp.  110, 111.\n<p 109>\n\nMr. Blades proceeds:  ``The chief cause\nof a `foul' case was the same in Shakspere's\ntime as now; and no one interested\nin the subject should omit visiting\na printing office, where he could personally\ninspect the operation.  Suppose a\ncompositor at work `distributing'; the upper\nand lower cases, one above the other,\nslant at a considerable angle towards him,\nand as the types fall quickly from his\nfingers they form conical heaps in their\nrespective boxes, spreading out in a\nmanner very similar to the sand in the\nlower half of an hour-glass.  Now, if the\ncompositor allows his case to become too\nfull, the topmost letters in each box will\ncertainly slide down into the box below,\nand occasionally, though rarely, into one\nof the side boxes.  When such letters\nescape notice, they necessarily cause\nerroneous spelling, and sometimes entirely\nchange the whole meaning of a sentence.\nBut now comes the important question:\nAre errors of this kind ever discovered,\nand especially do they occur in Shakspere?\nDoubtless they do, but to what extent a\nlong and careful examination alone can\n\n<Table>\n                              UPPER CASE.\n <a'>  <e'>  <i'>  <o'>  <u'>  <SE>  <DDag> A   B   C   D   E    F   G\n <a!>  <e!>  <i!>  <o!>  <u!>  <||>  <Dag>  H   I   K   L   M    N   O\n <a^>  <e^>  <i^>  <o^>  <u^>  <?\u0014>  <*>    P   Q   R   S   T    V   W\n  X     Y     Z    <AE>  <OE>   U     J     X   Y   Z  <AE> <OE> U   J\n <a:>  <e:>  <i:>  <o:>  <u:>  <c,>  <Pd>   A   B   C   D   E    F   G\n  1     2     3     4     5     6     7     H   I   K   L   M    N   O\n  8     9     0   <1/4> <1/2> <3/4>   k     P   Q   R   S   T    V   W\n\n                              LOWER CASE.\n &  [ ]  <ae>  <oe>  j   '     Thin and   ( )   ?   !   ;   Leaders.  fl\n                           middling spaces.\n --                         e                               Leaders.  ff\n     b        c        d            i        s      f   g\n ffl                                                        Leaders.  fi\n ffi                                                        En     Em\n     l        m        n     h      o       y   p   ,   w  quads. quads.\n Hair\n spaces.\n z                                                  q   :\n     v        u        t thick spaces a     r               Large quods.\n x                                                  .   <.>\n<EndTable>\n\n\n<p 112>show.  As examples merely, and to show\nthe possible change in sense made by a\nsingle wrong letter, I will quote one or\ntwo instances:--\n\n     `Were they not _forc'd_ with those that should be ours,\n      We might have met them darefull, beard to beard.'\n                                   _Macbeth_, v. 5.[9]\n\n\n     [9] Collier's MS. corrector substituted _farc'd_ for _forc'd_.\n\n\nThe word _forced_ should be read _farced_,\nthe letter _o_ having evidently dropped\ndown into _a_ box.  The enemy's ranks\nwere not _forced_ with Macbeth's followers,\nbut _farced_ or filled up.  In Murrell's\n_Cookery_, 1632, this identical word is used\nseveral times; we there see that a\nfarced leg of mutton was when the meat\nwas all taken out of the skin, mixed with\nherbs, etc., and then the skin filled up\nagain.\n\n     `I come to thee for charitable license . . .\n      To booke our dead.'\n                                   _Henry V_., iv. 7.\n\nSo all the copies, but `to book' is surely\na modern commercial phrase, and the\n<p 113>Herald here asked leave simply to `look,'\nor to examine, the dead for the purpose\nof giving honourable burial to their men\nof rank.  In the same sense Sir W. Lucie,\nin the First Part of _Henry VI_., says:--\n\n     `I come to know what prisoners thou hast tane,\n          And to survey the bodies of the dead.'\n\nWe cannot imagine an officer with pen,\ninkhorn, and paper, at a period when few\ncould write, `booking' the dead.  We\nmay, I think, take it for granted that here\nthe letter _b_ had fallen over into the _l_\nbox.''\n\nAnother point to bear in mind is the\nexistence of such logotypes as _fi_, _si_, etc.,\nso that, as Mr. Blades says, ``the change of\nlight into sight must not be considered as\na question of a single letter--of _s_ in the\n_l_ box,'' because the box containing _si_ is\nfar away from the _l_ box, and their contents\ncould not well get mixed.\n\nTo these instances given by Mr. Blades\nmay be added a very interesting correction\nsuggested to the author some years ago\nby a Shakespearian student.  When Isabella\nvisits her brother in prison, the\n<p 114>cowardly Claudio breaks forth in\ncomplaint, and paints a vivid picture of the\nhorrors of the damned:--\n\n ``Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;\n   To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;\n   This sensible warm motion to become\n   A kneaded clod; and the _delighted spirit_\n   To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside\n   In thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice;\n   To be imprisoned in the viewless winds,\n   And blown with restless violence round about\n   The pendent world; or to be worse than worst\n   Of those that lawless and incertain thoughts\n   Imagine howling!--'tis too horrible!\n   The weariest and most loathed worldly life\n   That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment\n   Can lay on nature, is a paradise\n   To what we fear of death.''\n               _Measure for Measure_, act iii., sc. 1.\n\nWe have here, in the expression ``delighted\nspirit,'' a difficulty which none of\nthe commentators have as yet been able\nto explain.  Warburton said that the\nadjective meant ``accustomed to ease\nand delights,'' but this was not a very\nsuccessful guess, although Steevens\nadopted it.  Sir Thomas Hanmer altered\n_delighted_ to _dilated_, and Dr. Johnson\n<p 115>mentions two suggested emendations,\none being _benighted_ and the other\n_delinquent_.  None of these suggestions can\nbe corroborated by a reference to the\nplans of the printers' cases, but it will be\nseen that the one now proposed is much\nstrengthened by the position of the boxes\nin those plans.  The suggested word is\n_deleted_, which accurately describes the\nspirits as destroyed, or blotted out of\nexistence.  The word is common in the\nprinting office, and it was often used in\nliterature.\n\nIf we think only of the recognised\nspelling of the word _delighted_ we shall\nfind that there are three letters to alter,\nbut if we take the older spelling, _delited_,\nthe change is very easily made, for it\nwill be noticed that the letters in the\n_i_ box might easily tumble over into the\n_e_ box.\n\nThere is a very curious description of\nhell in Bede's _Ecclesiastical History_, where\nthe author speaks of ``deformed spirits''\nwho leap from excess of heat to cutting\ncold, and it is not improbable that\nShakespeare may have had this passage in his\n<p 116>mind when he put these words into the\nmouth of Claudio.[10]\n\n\n     [10] An article on this point will be found in _The\nAntiquary_, vol. viii. (1883), p. 200.\n\n\n\nIt is taken for granted that the\ncompositor is not likely to put his hand into\nthe wrong box, so that if a wrong letter\nis used, it must have fallen out of its\nplace.\n\nAn important class of misprints owes\nits origin to this misplacement; but, as\nnoticed by Mr. Blades, there are other\nclasses, such as misspellings caused by\nthe compositor's ignorance or\nmisunderstanding.  We must remember that the\nprinter has to work fast, and if he does\nnot recognise a word he is very likely to\nturn it into something he does understand.\nThus the title of a paper in the\n_Philosophical Transactions_ was curiously\nchanged in an advertisement, and the\nCalamites, a species of fossil plants of\nthe coal measures, with but slight change\nappeared as ``The True Fructification of\nCalamities.''  This is a blunder pretty sure\nto be made, and within a few days of\nwriting this, the author has seen a\nrefer<p 117>ence to ``Notes on some Pennsylvanian\nCalamities.''  As an instance of less\nexcusable ignorance, we shall often find the\nword _gauge_ printed as _guage_.\n\nOne of the slightest of misprints was\nthe cause of an odd query in the second\nseries of _Notes and Queries_, which, by the\nway, has never yet been answered.  In\nJohn Hall's _Hor<ae> Vaciv<ae>_ (1646) there is\nthis passage, alluding to the table game\ncalled _tick-tack_.  The author wrote:\n``Tick tack sets a man's intentions on\ntheir guard.  Errors in this and war can\nbe but once amended''; but the printer\njoined the two words ``and war'' into one,\nand this puzzled the correspondent of\nthe _Notes and Queries_ (v. 272).  He\nasked:  ``Who can quote another passage\nfrom any author containing this word?\nI have hunted after it in many dictionaries\nwithout avail.  It means, I suppose,\nantagonism or contest, and resembles in\nform many Anglo-Saxon words which\nnever found their way into English proper.''\nThe blunder was not discovered, and\nanother correspondent wrote:  ``The word\nandwar would surely modernise into\n_hand-<p 118>war_.  Is not andirons (handirons) a\nparallel word of the same genus?'  In\nthe General Index we find ``Andwar, an\nold English word.''  So much for the long\nlife of a very small blunder.\n\nA very similar blunder to this of\n``andwar'' occurs in _Select Remains of the\nlearned John Ray with his Life by the late\nWilliam Derham_, which was published\nin 1760 with a dedication to the Earl of\nMacclesfield, President of the Royal\nSociety, signed by George Scott.  In\nDerham's Life of Ray a list of books\nread by Ray in 1667 is printed from\na letter to Dr. Lister, and one of these\nis printed ``The Business about great\nRakes.''  Mr. Scott must have been\npuzzled with this title; but he was\nevidently a man not to be daunted by a\ndifficulty, for he added a note to this\neffect:  ``They are now come into general\nuse among the farmers, and are called\n_drag rakes_.''  Who would suspect after\nthis that the title is merely a misprint,\nand that the pamphlet refers to the\nproceedings of Valentine Greatrakes, the\nfamous stroker, who claimed equal power\n<p 119>with the kings and queens of England in\ncuring the king's evil?  This blunder will\nbe found uncorrected in Dr. Lankester's\n_Memorials of John Ray_, published by the\nRay Society in 1846, and does not seem\nto have been suspected until the Rev.\nRichard Hooper called attention to it a\nshort time ago in _Notes and Queries_.[11]\n\n\n     [11] Seventh Series, iv. 225.\n\n\n\nAn amusing instance of the invention\nof a new word was afforded when the\nprinter produced the words ``a noticeable\nfact in thisms'' instead of ``this MS.''\n\nThe misplacement of a stop, or the\ntransposition of a letter, or the dropping\nout of one, will make sad havoc of the\nsense of a passage, as when we read of\nthe _immoral_ works of Milton.  It was,\nhowever, a very complimentary misprint\nby which it was made to appear that a\ncertain town had a remarkably high rate\nof _morality_.  In the address to Dr. Watts\nby J. Standen prefixed to that author's\n_Hor<ae> Lyric<ae>_ (Leeds, 1788) this same\nmisprint occurs, to the serious confusion\nof Mr. Standen's meaning,--\n<p 120>\n                    ``With thought sublime\n     And high sonorous words, thou sweetly sing'st\n     To thy _immoral_ lyre.''\n\nOn another page of this same book\nWatts' ``daring flight'' is transposed to\n_darling flight_.\n\nIn Miss Yonge's _Dynevor Terrace_ a\nportion of one word was joined on to\nanother with the awkward result that a\nyoung lady is described ``without stretched\narms.''\n\nThe odd results of the misplacement of\nstops must be familiar to most readers;\nbut it is not often that they are so serious\nas in the following instances.  William\nSharp, the celebrated line engraver,\nbelieved in the Divine mission of the madman\nRichard Brothers, and engraved a portrait of\nthat worthy with the following inscription\nbeneath it:  ``Fully believing this to be the\nman appointed by God, I engrave his\nlikeness.--W. SHARP.''  The writing engraver\nby mistake put the comma after the word\nappointed, and omitted it at the latter part\nof the sentence, thus giving a ludicrous\neffect to the whole inscription.  Many\nimpressions were struck off before the\n<p 121>mistake was discovered and rectified.  The\nquestion of an apostrophe was the ground\nof a civil action a few years ago in\nSwitzerland; and although the anecdote refers to\na manuscript, and not to a printed document,\nit is inserted here because it illustrates\nthe subject.  A gentleman left a will\nwhich ended thus:  ``Et pour t<e'>moigner\n<a!> mes neveux Charles et Henri de M----\ntoute mon affection je l<e!>gue <a!> chacun\n_d'eux_ cent mille francs.''  The paper upon\nwhich the will was written was folded up\nbefore the ink was dry, and therefore many\nof the letters were blotted.  The legatees\nasserted that the apostrophe was a blot,\nand therefore claimed two instead of one\nhundred thousand francs each.\n\nSeveral misprints are always recurring,\nsuch as the mixture of the words\nTopography and Typography, and Biography\nwith Bibliography.  In the prospectus of\nan edition of the _Waverley Novels_ we\nread:  ``The aim of the publishers has\nbeen to make it pre-eminent, by beauty\nof _topography_ and illustration, as an _<e'>dition\nde luxe_.''\n\nAndrew Marvell published a book which\n<p 122>he entitled _The Rehearsal Transprosed_; but\nit is seldom that a printer can be induced\nto print the title otherwise than as _The\nRehearsal Transposed_.\n\nIt must be conceded in favour of printers\nthat some authors do write an execrable\nhand.  One sometimes receives a letter\nwhich requires about three readings before\nit can be understood.  At the first time of\nreading the meaning is scarcely intelligible,\nat the second time some faint glimpse of the\nwriter's object in writing is obtained, and\nat the third time the main point of the\nletter is deciphered.  Such men may be\ndeemed to be the plague of printers.  A\nfriend of Beloe ``the Sexagenarian'' was\nremonstrated with by a printer for being\nthe cause of a large amount of swearing\nin his office.  ``Sir,'' exclaimed Mr. A.,\n``the moment `copy' from you is divided\namong the compositors, volley succeeds\nvolley as rapidly and as loudly as in one\nof Lord Nelson's victories.''\n\nThere is a popular notion among authors\nthat it is not wise to write a clear hand; and\nM<e'>nage was one of the first to express it.\nHe wrote:  ``If you desire that no mistakes\n<p 123>shall appear in the works which you publish,\nnever send well-written copy to the\nprinter, for in that case the manuscript is\ngiven to young apprentices, who make a\nthousand errors; while, on the other hand,\nthat which is difficult to read is dealt with\nby the master-printers.''  It is also related\nthat the late eminent Arabic scholar, Mr.\nE. W. Lane, who wrote a particularly good\nhand, asked his printer how it was that\nthere were always so many errors in his\nproofs.  He was answered that such clear\nwriting was always given to the boys, as\nexperienced compositors could not be\nspared for it.  The late Dean Hook held\nto this opinion, for when he was asked to\nallow a sermon to be copied out neatly for\nthe press, he answered that if it were to\nbe printed he would prefer to write it\nout himself as badly as he could.  This\npractice, if it ever existed, we are told by\nexperienced printers does not exist now.\n\nIt must, one would think, have been\nthe badness of the ``copy'' that induced\nthe compositors to turn ``the nature and\ntheory of the Greek verb'' into _the native\ntheology of the Greek verb_; ``the conser<p 124>vation\nof energy'' into the _conversation of\nenergy_; and the ``Forest Conservancy\nBranch'' into the _Forest Conservatory\nBranch_.\n\nSome printers go out of their way to\nmake blunders when they are unable to\nunderstand their ``copy.''  Thus, in the\n_Times_, some years ago, among the contributors\nto the Garibaldi Fund was a bookbinder\nwho gave five shillings.  The next\ndown in the list was one ``A. Lega\nFletcher,'' a name which was printed as _A\nLedger stitcher_.\n\nSome very extraordinary blunders have\nbeen made by the ignorant misreading\nof an author's contractions.  It is said\nthat in a certain paper which was sent\nto be printed the words Indian Government\nwere contracted as Indian Govt.\nThis one compositor set up throughout\nhis turn as _Indian goat_.  A writer in\none of the Reviews wrote the words ``J. C.\nfirst invaded Britain,'' and a worthy\ncompositor, who made it his business to fill\nup all the abbreviations, printed this as\n_Jesus Christ_ instead of Julius C<ae>sar.\n\nHere it may be remarked that some of\n<p 125>the most extraordinary misprints never\nget farther than the printing office or the\nstudy; but although they may have been\ndiscovered by the reader or the author,\nthey were made nevertheless.\n\nSometimes the fun of a misprint consists\nin its elaborateness and completeness,\nand sometimes in its simplicity\n(perhaps only the change of a letter).\nOf the first class the transformation of\nShirley's well-known lines is a good\nexample:--\n\n     ``Only the actions of the just\n       Smell sweet and blossom in the dust.''\n\nis scarcely recognisable as\n\n     ``All the low actions of the just\n       Swell out and blow Sam in the dust.''\n\nThe statement that ``men should work\nand play Loo,'' obtained from ``men should\nwork and play too,'' illustrates the second\nclass.\n\nThe version of Pope which was quoted\nby a correspondent of the _Times_ about a\nyear ago is very charming:--\n\n     ``A little learning is a dangerous thing;\n       Drink deep, or taste not the aperient spring.'\n\n<p 126>The reporter or printer who mistook the\nOxford professor's allusion to the\nEumenides, and quoted him as speaking of\n``those terrible old Greek goddesses--the\nHumanities,'' was still more elaborate in\nhis joke.\n\nHorace Greeley is well known to have\nbeen an exceedingly bad writer; but when\nhe quoted the well-known line (which is\nsaid to be equal to a florin, because there\nare four tizzies in it)--\n\n     `` 'Tis true, 'tis pity, pity 'tis 'tis true,''\n\none might have expected the compositor\nto recognise the quotation, instead of\nprinting the astonishing calculation--\n\n     `` 'Tis two, 'tis fifty and fifty 'tis, 'tis five.''\n\nThis is as bad as the blunder of the\nprinter of the Hampshire paper who is\nsaid to have announced that Sir Robert\nPeel and a party of _fiends_ were engaged\nshooting _peasants_ at Drayton Manor.\n\nIt is perhaps scarcely fair to quote too\nmany blunders from newspapers, which\nmust often be hurriedly compiled, but\nnaturally they furnish the richest crop.\n<p 127>The point of a leader in an American\npaper was lost by a misprint, which reads\nas follows:  ``We do battle without shot or\ncharge for the cause of the right.''  This\nwould be a very ineffectual battle, and the\nproper words were _without stint or change_.\n\nA writer on Holland in one of the\nmagazines quoted Samuel Butler's well-\nknown lines--\n\n     ``A country that draws fifty foot of water,\n     .    .    .    .    .    .    .\n     In which they do not live, but go aboard,''\n\nwhich the printer transformed into\n\n     ``In which they do not live, but _cows abound_.''\n\n\nIt is of course easy to invent\nmisprints, and therefore one feels a little\ndoubtful sometimes with respect to those\nwhich are quoted without chapter and\nverse.\n\nOne of the most remarkable blunders\never made in a newspaper was connected\nwith the burial of the well-known literary\nman, John Payne Collier.  In the _Standard_\nof Sept. 21st, 1883, it was reported\nthat ``the remains of the late Mr.\nJohn Payne Collier were interred yesterday\n<p 128>in Bray Churchyard, near Maidenhead,\nin the presence of a large number of\nspectators.''  The paragraph maker of the\n_Eastern Daily Press_ had never heard of\nPayne Collier, so he thought the last name\nshould be printed with a small C, and\nwanting a heading for his paragraph he\ninvented one straight off, and this is what\nappeared in that paper:--\n\n``_The Bray Colliery Disaster_.  The\nremains of the late John Payne, collier,\nwere interred yesterday afternoon in the\nBray Churchyard, in the presence of a\nlarge number of friends and spectators.''\n\nThis was a brilliant stroke of\nimagination, for who would expect to find a\ncolliery near Maidenhead?\n\nMr. Sala, writing to _Notes and Queries_\n(Third Series, i. 365), says:  ``Altogether I\nhave long since arrived at the conclusion\nthat there are more `devils' in a printing\noffice than are dreamt of in our philosophy--\nthe blunder fiends to wit--ever\nbusy in peppering the `formes' with errors\nwhich defy the minutest revisions of\nreader, author, sub-editor, and editor.''\nMr. Sala gives an instance which occurred\n<p 129>to himself.  He wrote that Dr.\nLivingstone wore a cap with a tarnished gold\nlace band; but the printer altered the\nword tarnished into _famished_, to the serious\nconfusion of the passage.\n\nSome of the most amusing blunders\noccur by the change of a single letter.\nThus, in an account of the danger to an\nexpress train by a cow getting on the line\nin front, the reporter was made to say that\nas the safest course under the circumstances\nthe engine driver ``put on full\nsteam, dashed up against the cow, and\nliterally cut it into _calves_.''  A short time\nago an account was given in an address of\nthe early struggles of an eminent portrait\npainter, and the statement appeared in\nprint that, working at the easel from eight\no'clock in the morning till eight o'clock\nat night, the artist ``only lay down on the\nhearthrug for rest and refreshment between\nthe visits of his _sisters_.''  This is\nnot so bad, however, as the report that\n``a bride was accompanied to the altar by\n_tight_ bridesmaids.''  A very odd blunder\noccurred in the _World_ of Oct. 6th, 1886,\none which was so odd that the editor\n<p 130>thought it worthy of notice by himself in\na subsequent number.  The paragraph in\nwhich the misprint occurred related to the\nfilling up of the vicarage of St. Mary's,\nIslington, which it was thought had been\nunduly delayed.  The trustees in whose\ngift the living is were informed that if they\nhad a difficulty in finding a clergyman of\nthe proper complexion of low churchism\nthere were still Venns in Kent.  Here\nthe natural confusion of the letters _u_ and\n_n_ came into play, and as the paragraph\nwas printed it appeared that a _Venus_ of\nKent was recommended for the vicarage\nof St. Mary's.\n\nThe compositor who set up the account\nof a public welcome to a famous orator\nmust have been fresh from the study of\nPorson's _Catechism of the Swinish Multitude_\nwhen he set up the damaging statement\nthat ``the crowd rent the air with\ntheir _snouts_.''\n\nSometimes the blunder consists not in\nthe misprint of a letter, but in a mere\ntransposition, as when an eminent herald\nand antiquary was dubbed _Rogue Croix_\ninstead of _Rouge Croix_.  Sometimes a\n<p 131>new but appropriate word results by the\nthrusting into a recognised word of a\nredundant letter, as when a man died from\neating too much goose the verdict was\nsaid to have been ``death from stuffocation.''\n\nMany of these blunders, although\namusing to the public, cannot have been\naltogether agreeable to the subjects of them.\nMr. Justice Wightman could not have\nbeen pleased to see himself described\nas _Mr. Justice Nightman_; and the right\nreverend prelate who was stated ``to be\nhighly pleased with some ecclesiastical\n_iniquities_ shown to him'' must have been\nconsiderably scandalised.\n\nProfessor Hales is very much of the\nopinion of Mr. Sala respecting the labours\nof the ``blunder fiend,'' and he sent an\namusing letter to the _Athen<ae>um_, in which\nhe pointed out a curious misprint in one\nof his own books.  As the contents of the\nletter is very much to the point, readers\nwill perhaps not object to seeing it\ntransferred in its entirety to these pages:--\n\n``The humour of compositors is apt to be\nimperfectly appreciated by authors, because\n<p 132>it rather interferes with what the author\nwishes to say, although it may often say\nsomething better.  But there is no reason\nwhy the general reader should not\nthoroughly enjoy it.  Certainly it ought to\nbe more generously recognised than it is.\nSo many persons at present think of it\nas merely accidental and fortuitous, as if\nthere was no mind in it, as if all the\nexcellent things loosely described as _errata_, all\nthe _curios<ae> felicitates_ of the setter-up of\ntexts, were casual blunders.  Such a view\nreminds one of the way in which the last-\ncentury critics used to speak of Shakspere\n--the critics who give him no credit for\ndesign or selection, but thought that somehow\nor other he stumbled into greatness.\nHowever, I propose now not to attempt\nthe defence, or, what might be worth the\neffort, the analysis of this species of Wit,\nbut only to give what seemed an admirable\ninstance of it.\n\n``In a note to the word _limboes_ in the\nClarendon Press edition of Milton's\n_Areopagitica_, I quoted from Nares's Glossary\na list of the various _limbi_ believed\nin by the `old schoolmen,' and No. 2\n<p 133>was `a _limbus patrum_ where the fathers\nof the Church, saints, and martyrs, awaited\nthe general resurrection.'  Will any one\nsay it was not a stroke of genius in some\nprinting-office humourist to alter the last\nword into `_in_surrection'?\n\n``Like all good wit, this change is so\nsuggestive.  It raises up a cloud of new\nideas, and reduces the hearer to a delightful\nconfusion.  How strangely it revises\nall our popular notions!  If even beyond\nthe grave the great problems that keep\nmen here restless and murmuring are not\nsolved!  If even there the rebellious spirit\nis not quieted!  Nay, if those whom we\nthink of as having won peace for themselves\nin this world, do in that join the\nmalcontents, and are each one biding their\ntime--\n\n     <gr <w!>s t<h!>n Di<o!>s turann<i'>d' <e'>kp<<e'>rswn b<i'>a>.\n\n\n``May we not conceive this bold jester,\nif haply he were a stonemason, chiselling\non some tombstone `_In_surgam'?''\n\nAllusion has already been made to the\npersistency of misprints and the difficulty\nof curing them; but one of the most\n<p 134>curious instances of this may be found in\na line of Byron's beautiful apostrophe to\nthe ocean in _Childe Harold_ (Canto iv.).\nThe one hundred and eighty-second\nstanza is usually printed:--\n\n ``Thy shores are empires, changed in all save thee--\n   Assyria, Greece, Rome, Carthage, what are they?\n   Thy waters wasted them while they were free,\n   And many a tyrant since . . .''\n\nNot many years ago a critic, asking\nhimself the question when the waters\nwasted these countries, began to suspect\na misprint, and on consulting the\nmanuscript, it was found that he was right.\nThe blunder, which had escaped Byron's\nown eyes, was corrected, and the third\nline was printed as originally written:--\n\n     ``Thy waters wash'd them power while they were free.\n\n\nThe carelessness of printers seems to\nhare culminated in their production of\nthe Scriptures.  The old editions of the\nBible swarm with blunders, and some of\nthem were supposed to have been made\nintentionally.  It was said that the printer\n<p 135>Field received <Pd>1500 from the\nIndependents as a bribe to corrupt a text which\nmight sanction their practice of lay-\nordination, and in Acts vi. 3 the word _ye_ is\nsubstituted for _we_ in several of his editions\nof the Bible.  The verse reads:  ``Wherefore,\nbrethren, look ye out among ye seven\nmen of honesr report, full of the Holy\nGhost and wisdom, whom _ye_ may appoint\nover this business.''  To such forgeries\nButler refers in the lines:--\n\n\n ``Religion spawn'd a various rout\n   Of petulant capricious sects,\n   The maggots of corrupted texts.''\n               _Hudibras_, Part III., Canto 2.\n\n\nDr. Grey, in his notes on this passage,\nbrings forward the charge against Field,\nand quotes Wotton's Visitation Sermon\n(1706) in support of it.  He also quotes\nfrom Cowley's _Puritan and Papist_ as to\nthe practice of corrupting texts:--\n\n\n ``They a bold pow'r o'er sacred Scriptures take,\n   Blot out some clauses and some new ones make.''\n\n\nPope Sixtus the Fifth's Vulgate so\nswarmed with errors that paper had to\n<p 136>be pasted over some of the erroneous\npassages, and the public naturally laughed\nat the bull prefixed to the first volume\nwhich excommunicated any printer who\naltered the text.  This was all the more\nannoying to the Pope, as he had intended\nthe edition to be specially free from errors,\nand to attain that end had seen all the\nproofs himself.  Some years ago a copy\nof this book was sold in France for 1210\nfrancs.\n\nThe King's Printers, Robert Barker and\nMartin Lucas, in the reign of Charles I.\nwere not excommunicated, but, what perhaps\nthey liked less, were fined <Pd>300\nby the Court of High Commission for\nleaving the _not_ out of the seventh\ncommandment in an edition of the Bible\nprinted in 1631.  Although this story has\nbeen frequently quoted it has been\ndisbelieved, and the great bibliographer of\nBibles, the late Mr. George Offer, asserted\nthat he and his father searched diligently\nfor it, and could not find it.  Now, six\ncopies are known to exist.  The late Mr.\nHenry Stevens gives a most interesting\naccount of the first discovery of the book\n<p 137>in his _Recollections of Mr. James Lennox_.\nHe writes:--\n\n``Mr. Lennox was so strict an observer\nof the Sabbath that I never knew of his\nwriting a business letter on Sunday but\nonce.  In 1855, while he was staying at\nHotel Meurice in Paris, there occurred to\nme the opportunity one Saturday afternoon,\nJune 16th, of identifying the long lost\noctavo Bible of 1631 with the negative\nomitted in the seventh commandment,\nand purchasing it for fifty guineas.  No\nother copy was then known, and the\npossessor required an immediate answer.\nHowever, I raised some points of inquiry,\nand obtained permission to hold the little\nsinner and give the answer on Monday.\nBy that evening's post I wrote to Mr.\nLennox, and pressed for an immediate\nreply, suggesting that this prodigal though\nhe returned on Sunday should be\nbound.  Monday brought a letter `to\nbuy it,' very short, but tender as a fatted\ncalf.  On June 21st I exhibited it at a\nfull meeting of the Society of Antiquaries\nof London, at the same time nicknaming\nit _The Wicked Bible_, a name that stuck to\n<p 138>it ever since, though six copies are now\nknown. . . .  Lord Macaulay was present\nat the meeting, but did not at first credit\nthe genuineness of the typographical\nerror.  Lord Stanhope, however, on\nborrowing the volume, convinced him\nthat it was the true wicked error.''\n\nCuriously enough, when Mr. Stevens\ntook the Bible home on Saturday night\nhe overhauled his pile of octavo Bibles,\nand found an imperfect duplicate of the\nsupposed unique ``wicked'' Bible.  When\nthe owner came for his book on Monday\nmorning he was shown the duplicate, and\nagreed, as his copy was not unique, to\ntake <Pd>25 for it.  The imperfect copy\nwas sold to the British Museum for\neighteen guineas, and Mr. Winter Jones\nwas actually so fortunate as to obtain\nsubsequently the missing twenty-three\nleaves.  A third copy came into the\nhands of Mr. Francis Fry, of Bristol,\nwho sold it to Dr. Bandinel for the\nBodleian Library.  A fourth copy is in\nthe Euing Library, at Glasgow; a fifth\nfell into the hands of Mr. Henry J.\nAtkinson, of Gunnersbury,in 1883; and\n<p 139>a sixth copy was picked up in Ireland\nby a gentleman of Coventry In 1884.\n\nIn a Bible of 1634 the first verse of\nthe 14th Psalm is printed as ``The fool\nhath said in his heart there is God''; and\nin another Bible of 1653 _worldly_ takes\nthe place of _godly_, and reads, ``In order\nthat all the world should esteem the\nmeans of arriving at worldly riches.''\n\nIf Field was not a knave, as hinted\nabove, he was singularly unfortunate in\nhis blunders; for in another of his Bibles\nhe also omitted the negative in an important\npassage, and printed I Corinthians\nvi. 9 as, ``Know ye not that the unrighteous\nshall inherit the kingdom of God?''\n\nIt is recorded that a printer's widow\nin Germany once tampered with the\npurity of the text of a Bible printed in\nher house, for which crime she was burned\nto death.  She arose in the night, when\nall the workmen were in bed, and going\nto the ``forme'' entirely changed the\nmeaning of a text which particularly\noffended her.  The text was Gen. iii. 16\n(``Thy desire shall be to thy husband,\nand he shall rule over thee'').\n<p 140>\n\nThis story does not rest on a very firm\nfoundation, and as the recorder does not\nmention the date of the occurrence, it\nmust be taken by the reader for what it is\nworth.  The following incident, vouched\nfor by a well-known author, is, however,\nvery similar.  James Silk Buckingham\nrelates the following curious anecdote in\nhis _Autobiography_:--\n\n``While working at the Clarendon\nPrinting Office a story was current among\nthe men, and generally believed to be\nauthentic, to the following effect.  Some\nof the gay young students of the University,\nwho loved a practical joke, had made\nthemselves sufficiently familiar with the\nmanner in which the types are fixed in\ncertain formes and laid on the press, and\nwith the mode of opening such formes for\ncorrection when required; and when the\nsheet containing the Marriage Service was\nabout to be worked off, as finally\ncorrected, they unlocked the forme, took out\na single letter _v_, and substituted in its\nplace the letter _k_, thus converting the\nword _live_ into _like_.  The result was that,\nwhen the sheets were printed, that part\n<p 141>of the service which rendered the bond\nirrevocable, was so changed as to make it\neasily dissolved--as the altered passage\nnow read as follows:--The minister asking\nthe bridegroom, `Wilt thou have this\nwoman to be thy wedded wife, to live\ntogether after God's ordinance in the holy\nstate of matrimony?  Wilt thou love her,\ncomfort her, honour, and keep her in\nsickness and in health; and forsaking all\nother, keep thee only unto her, so long as\nye both shall _like_?'  To which the man\nshall answer, `I will.'  The same change\nwas made in the question put to the\nbride.''\n\nIf the culprits who left out a word\ndeserved to be heavily mulcted in damages,\nit is difficult to calculate the liability of\nthose who left out whole verses.  When\nArchbishop Ussher was hastening to\npreach at Paul's Cross, he went into a\nshop to purchase a Bible, and on turning\nover the pages for his text found it was\nomitted.\n\nAndrew Anderson, a careless, faulty\nprinter in Edinburgh, obtained a monopoly\nas king's printer, which was exercised on\n<p 142>his death in 1679 by his widow.  The\nproductions of her press became worse and\nworse, and her Bibles were a standing\ndisgrace to the country.  Robert\nChambers, in his _Domestic Annals of\nScotland_, quotes the following specimen\nfrom an edition of 1705:  ``Whyshouldit-\nbethougtathingincredi  ble w<tS> you, y<tS>\nGod should raise the dead?''  Even this\nmiserable blundering could not have been\nmuch worse than the Pearl Bible with\nsix thousand errata mentioned by Isaac\nDisraeli.\n\nThe first edition of the English Scriptures\nprinted in Ireland was published at\nBelfast in 1716, and is notorious for an\nerror in Isaiah.  _Sin no more_ is printed\n_Sin on more_.  In the following year was\npublished at Oxford the well-known\nVinegar Bible, which takes its name from\na blunder in the running title of the\ntwentieth chapter of St. Luke's Gospel,\nwhere it reads ``The parable of the\nvinegar,'' instead of ``The parable of the\nvineyard.''  In a Cambridge Prayer Book\nof 1778 the thirtieth verse of Psalm cv. is\ntravestied as follows:  ``Their land brought\n<p 143>forth frogs, yea seven in their king's\nchambers.''  An Oxford Bible of 1792\nnames St. Philip instead of St. Peter as\nthe disciple who should deny Christ\n(Luke xxii. 34); and in an Oxford New\nTestament of 1864 we read, ``Rejoice,\nand be exceeding _clad_'' (Matt. v. 12).\nTo be impartial, however, it is necessary to\nmention a Cambridge Bible of 1831,\nwhere Psalm cxix. 93 appears as ``I will\nnever _forgive_ thy precepts.''  A Bible\nprinted at Edinburgh in 1823 contains\na curious misprint caused by a likeness in\npronunciation of two words, Esther being\nprinted for Easter, ``Intending after\nEsther to bring him forth to the people''\n(Acts xii. 4).  A misprint of the old\nhundredth Psalm (_do well_ for _do dwell_) in\nthe Prayer Book might perhaps be\nconsidered as an improvement,--\n\n          ``All people who on earth do well.''\n\n\nErrors are specially frequent in figures,\noften caused by the way in which the\ncharacters are cut.  The aim of the\nfounder seems to be to make them as\nmuch alike as possible, so that it\nfre<p 144>quently requires a keen eye to discover\nthe difference between a 3 and a 5.  In\none of Chernac's _Mathematical Tables_\na line fell out before going to press, and\ninstead of being replaced at the bottom\nof the page it was put in at the top, thus\ncausing twenty-six errors.  Besides these,\nhowever, only ten errors have been found\nin the whole work of 1020 pages, all full\nof figures.  Vieta's _Canon Mathematicus_\n(1579) is of great rarity, from the author\nbeing discontented with the misprints\nthat had escaped his notice, and on that\naccount withdrawing or repurchasing all\nthe copies he could meet with.  Some\nmathematicians, to ensure accuracy, have\nmade their calculations with the types in\ntheir own hands.  In the _Imperial\nDictionary of Universal Biography_ there is a\nmisprint in a date which confuses a whole\narticle.  William Ayrton, musical critic,\nis said to have been born in London\nabout 1781, but curiously enough his\nfather is reported to have been born three\nyears afterwards (1784); and still more\nodd, that father was appointed gentleman\nof the Chapel Royal in 1764, twenty\n<p 145>years before he is stated to have been\nborn.\n\nIn connection with figures may be\nmentioned the terrible confusion which\nis caused by the simple dropping out\nof a decimal point.  Thus a passage\nin which 6.36 is referred to naturally\nbecomes utter nonsense when 636 is\nprinted instead.  Such a misprint is as\nbad as the blunder of the French compositor,\nwho, having to set up a passage\nreferring to Captain Cook, turned _de Cook_\ninto _de 600 kilos_.  An amusing blunder\nwas quoted a few years ago from a German\npaper where the writer, referring to Prince\nBismarck's endeavours to keep on good\nterms with all the Powers, was made\nto say, ``Prince Bismarck is trying to\nkeep up honest and straightforward relations\n_with all the girls_.''  This blunder was\ncaused by the substitution of the word\nM<a:>dchen (girls) for M<a:>chten (powers).\n\nThe French have always been interested\nin misprints, and they have registered a\nconsiderable number.  One of the happiest\nis that one which was caused by Malherbe's\nbad writing, and induced him to\n<p 146>adopt the misprint in his verse in place\nof that which he had originally written.\nThe lines, written on a daughter of Du\nPerrier named Rosette, now stand thus:--\n\n\n ``Mais elle <e'>tait du monde o<u!> les plus belles choses\n     Ont le pire destin,\n   Et rose, elle a v<e'>cu ce que vivent les roses\n     L'espace d'un matin.''\n\nMalherbe had written,--\n\n ``Et Rosette a v<e'>cu ce que vivent les roses;''\n\n\nbut forgetting ``to cross his tees'' the\ncompositor made the fortunate blunder\nof printing _rose elle_, which so pleased the\nauthor that he let it stand, and modified\nthe following lines in accordance with the\nprinter's improvement.\n\nRabelais nearly got into trouble by\na blunder of his printer, who in several\nplaces set up _asne_ for _<a^>me_.  A council\nmet at the Sorbonne to consider the\ncase against him, and the doctors formally\ndenounced Rabelais to Francis I.,\nand requested permission to prosecute\nhim for heresy; but the king after\nconsideration refused to give the permission.\n<p 147>Rabelais then laughed at his accusers for\nfounding a charge of heresy against him\non a printer's blunder, but there were\nstrong suspicions that the misprints were\nintentional.\n\nThese misprints are styled by the\nFrench _coquilles_, a word whose derivation\nM. Boutney, author of _Dictionnaire\nde l'Argot des Typographes_, is unable\nto explain after twenty years' search.  A\nnumber of _Longman's Magazine_ contains\nan article on these _coquilles_, in which\nvery many amusing blunders are quoted.\nOne of these gave rise to a pun which is\nso excellent that it is impossible to resist\nthe temptation of transferring the anecdote\nfrom those pages to these:--\n\n``In the Rue Richelieu there is a statue\nof Corneille holding a roll in his hand,\non which are inscribed the titles of his\nprincipal works.  The task of incising\nthese names it appears had been given\nto an illiterate young apprentice, who\nthought proper to spell _avare_ with two\nr's.  A wit, observing this, remarked\npleasantly, _Tiens, voil<a!> an avare qui a un\nair misanthrope_ (un r mis en trop).''\n<p 148>\n\nIn a newspaper account of Mr. Gladstone's\nreligious views the word _Anglican_\nis travestied as _Afghan_, with the following\ncurious result:  ``There is no form of faith\nin existence more effectually tenacious\nthan the _Afghan_ form, which asserts the\nfull catholicity of that branch church\nwhose charter is the English Church\nPrayer Book.''\n\nIn the diary of John Hunter, of\nCraigcrook, it is recorded that at one of the\nmeetings between the diarist, Leigh Hunt,\nand Carlyle, ``Hunt gave us some capital\nspecimens of absurd errors of the press\ncommitted by printers from his copy.\nOne very good one occurs in a paper,\nwhere he had said, `he had a liking for\ncoffee because it always reminded him of\nthe _Arabian Nights_,' though not mentioned\nthere, adding, `as smoking does\nfor the same reason.'  This was converted\ninto the following oracular words:  `As\nsucking does for the snow season'!  He\ncould not find it in his heart to correct\nthis, and thus it stands as a theme for\nthe profound speculations of the commentators.''\n<p 149>\n\nA very slight misprint will make a\ngreat difference; sometimes an unintelliglble\nword is produced, but sometimes\nthe mere transposition of a letter will\nmake a word exactly opposite in its\nmeaning to the original, as _unite_ for\n_untie_.  In Jeremy Taylor's _XXV.  Sermons\npreached at Golden Grove: Being for the\nWinter half-year_ (London, 1653), p. 247,\nwe read, ``It may help to unite the\ncharm,'' whereas the author wished to\nsay ``untie.''\n\nThe title of Cobbett's _Horse-hoeing\nHusbandry_ was easily turned into _Horse-shoeing\nHusbandry_, that of the _Holy Grail_ into\n_Holy Gruel_, and Layamon's _Brut_ into\nLayamon's _Brat_.\n\nA local paper, reporting the proceedings\nat the Bath meeting of the British Asso{sic}\nciation, affirmed that an eminent chemist\nhad ``not been able to find any _fluidity_\nin the Bath waters.''  _Fluorine_ was meant.\nIt was also stated that a geologist asserted\nthat ``the bones found in the submerged\nforests of Devonshire were closely\nrepresentative of the British _farmer_.''  The last\nword should have been _fauna_.\n<p 150>\n\nThe strife of _tongs_ is suggestive of a\nmore serious battle than that of talk only;\nand the compositor who set up Portia's\nspeech--\n\n     ``. . . young Alcides, when he did redeem\n The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy''\n               (_Merchant of Venice_, act iii., sc. 2),\n\nand turned the last words into _howling\nTory_, must have been a rabid politician.\n\nThe transposition of ``He kissed her\nunder the silent stars'' into ``He kicked\nher under the cellar stairs'' looks rather\ntoo good to be true, and it cannot be\nvouched for; but the title ``Microscopic\nCharacter of the Virtuous Rocks of Montana''\nis a genuine misprint for _vitreous_,\nas is also ``Buddha's perfect _uselessness_''\nfor ``Buddha's perfect sinlessness.''  It is\nrather startling to find a quotation from\nthe _Essay on Man_ introduced by the\nwords ``as the Pope says,'' or to find the\nfamous painter Old Crome styled an ``old\nCrone.''\n\nA most amusing instance of a\nmisreading may be mentioned here, although\nit is not a literary blunder.  A certain\n<p 151>black cat was named Mephistopheles\na name which greatly puzzled the little\ngirl who played with the cat, so she\nvery sensibly set to work to reduce\nthe name to a form which she could\nunderstand, and she arrived at ``Miss\nPack-of-fleas.''\n\nSometimes a ludicrous blunder may be\nmade by the mere closing up of two\nwords; thus the orator who spoke of our\n``grand Mother Church'' had his remark\nturned into a joke when it was printed\nas ``grandmother Church.''  A still worse\nblunder was made in an obituary notice\nof a well-known congressman in an\nAmerican paper, where the reference to\nhis ``gentle, manly spirit'' was turned\ninto ``gentlemanly spirit.''\n\nMisprints are very irritating to most\nauthors, but some can afford to make fun\nof the trouble; thus Hood's amusing\nlines are probably founded upon some\nblunder that actually occurred:--\n\n\n ``But it is frightful to think\n     What nonsense sometimes\n   They make of one's sense,\n     And what's worse, of one's rhymes.\n\n<p 152>\n ``It was only last week,\n     In my ode upon Spring,\n   Which I meant to have made\n     A most beautiful thing,\n\n ``When I talked of the dew-drops\n     From freshly-blown roses,\n   The nasty things made it\n     From freshly-blown noses.\n\n ``And again, when, to please\n     An old aunt, I had tried\n   To commemorate some saint\n     Of her clique who had died,\n\n ``I said he had taken up\n     In heaven his position,\n   And they put it--he'd taken\n     Up to heaven his _physician_.''\n\n\nHenry Stephens (Estienne), the learned\nprinter, made a joke over a misprint.  The\nword _febris_ was printed with the diphthong\n<_oe_>, so Stephens excused himself by saying\nin the errata that ``le chalcographe a fait\nune fi<e!>vre longue (f<oe>brem) quoique une\nfi<e!>vre courte (febrem) soit moins dangereux.''\n\nAllusion has already been made in the\nfirst chapter to Professor Skeat's ghost\n<p 153>words.  Most of these have arisen from\nmisreadings or misprints, and two\nextraordinary instances may be noted here.\nThe purely modern phrase ``look sharp''\nwas supposed to have been used in the time\nof Chaucer, because ``loke schappe'' (see\nthat you form, etc.) of the manuscript was\nprinted ``loke scharpe.''  In the other\ninstance the scribe wrote _yn_ for _m_, and\nthus he turned ``chek matyde'' into\n``chek yn a tyde.''[12]\n\n\n     [12] _Philol. Soc. Trans_. 1885-7, pp. 368-9.\n\n\n\nIn the _Academy_ for Feb.  25th, 1888,\nDr. Skeat explained another discovery\nof his of the same kind, by which he is\nable to correct a time-honoured blunder\nin English literature:--\n\n               ``CAMBRIDGE: _Feb_. 14, 1888.\n\n\n``When I explained, in the _Academy_ for\nJanuary 7 (p. 9), that the word `Herenus '\nis simply a mistake for `Herines,' _i.e_., the\nfuries (such being the Middle-English form\nof Erinnyes), I did not expect that I should\nso soon light upon another singular\nperversion of the same word.\n<p 154>\n\n``In Chaucer's Works, ed. 1561, fol.\n322, back, there is a miserable poem, of\nmuch later date than that of Chaucer's\ndeath, entitled `The Remedie of Love.'\nThe twelfth stanza begins thus:\n\n `Come hither, thou Hermes, and ye furies all\n  Which fer been under us, nigh the nether pole,\n  Where Pluto reigneth,' etc.\n\nIt is clear that `Hermes' is a scribal error\nfor `Herines,' and that the scribe has\nadded `thou' out of his own head, to\nkeep `Hermes' company.  The context\nbears this out; for the author utterly\nrejects the inspiration of the Muses in the\npreceding stanza, and proceeds to invoke\nfuries, harpies, and, to use his own\nexpression, `all this lothsome sort.'  Many\nof the lines almost defy scansion, so that\nno help is to be got from observing the\nrun of the lines.  Nevertheless, this fresh\ninstance of the occurrence of `Herines'\nmuch assists my argument; all the more\nso, as it appears in a disguised shape.\n                    ``WALTER W. SKEAT.''\n\nSometimes a misprint is intentional, as\n<p 155>in the following instance.  At the\nbeginning of the century the _Courrier des Pays\nBas_ was bought by some young men, who\nchanged its politics, but kept on the editor.\nThe motto of the paper was from Horace:\n\n          ``Est modus in rebus,''\n\nand the editor, wishing to let his friends\nat a distance know that things were not\ngoing on quite well between him and his\nproprietors, printed this motto as,--\n\n          ``Est nodus in rebus.''\n\nThis was continued for three weeks before\nit was discovered and corrected by the\npersons concerned.\n\nAnother kind of misprint which we see\noccasionally is the misplacement of some\nlines of type.  This may easily occur when\nthe formes are being locked, and the result\nis naturally nonsense that much confuses\nthe reader.  Probably the finest instance of\nthis misplacement occurred some years ago\nin an edition of _Men of the Time_ (1856),\nwhere the entry relating to Samuel\nWilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, got mixed up\nwith that of Robert Owen, the Socialist,\n<p 156>with the result that the bishop was stated\nto be ``a confirmed sceptic as regards\nrevealed religion, but a believer in\nSpiritualism.''  It was this kind of blunder\nwhich suggested the formation of cross-\nreadings, that were once very popular.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIL\n\nSCHOOLBOYS' BLUNDERS.\n\nTHE blunders of the examined\nform a fruitful source of\namusement for us all, and many\ncomical instances have been published.\nThe mistakes which are constantly\noccurring must naturally be innumerable, but\nonly a few of them rise to the dignity of\na blunder.  If it be difficult to define a\nblunder, probably the best illustration of\nwhat it is will be found in the answers of\nthe boys under examination.  All classes\nof blunders may be found among these.\nThere are those which show confusion of\nknowledge, and those which exhibit an\ninsight into the heart of the matter while\nblundering in the form.  Two very good\nexamples occur to one's mind, but it is to\nbe feared that they owe their origin to\nsome keen spirit of mature years.  ``What\n<p 158>is Faith?--The quality by which we are\nenabled to believe that which we know is\nuntrue.''  Surely this must have\nemanated from a wit!  Again, the whole\nHomeric question is condensed into the\nfollowing answer:  ``Some people say that\nthe Homeric poems were not written by\nHomer, but by another man of the same\nname.''  If this is a blunder, who would\nnot wish to blunder so?\n\nA large class of schoolboys' blunders\nconsist in a confusion of words somewhat\nalike in sound, a confusion that is apt to\nfollow some of us through life.  ``Matins''\nhas been mixed up with ``pattens,'' and\ndescribed as something to wear on the\nfeet.  Nonconformists are said to be\npersons who cannot form anything, and\na tartan is assumed to be an inhabitant\nof Tartary.  The gods are believed by\none boy to live on nectarines, and by\nanother to imbibe ammonia.  The same\ndesire to make an unintelligible word\nexpress a meaning which has caused the\nrecognised but absurd spelling of _sovereign_\n(more wisely spelt _sovran_ by Milton)\nshows itself in the form ``Tea-trarck''\n<p 159>explained as the title of Herod given to\nhim because he invented or was fond of\ntea.[13]  A still finer confusion of ideas is to\nbe found in an answer reported by Miss\nGraham in the _University Correspondent_:\n``Esau was a man who wrote fables, and\nwho sold the copyright to a publisher for\na bottle of potash.''\n\n\n     [13] _Cornhill Magazine_, June 1888, pp. 619-28.\n\n\n\nThe following etymological guesses are\nnot so good, but they are worthy of\nregistration.  One boy described a blackguard\nas ``one who has been a shoeblack,'' while\nanother thought he was ``a man dressed\nin black.''  ``Polite'' is said to be derived\nfrom ``Pole,'' owing to the affability of the\nPolish race.  ``Heathen'' means ``covered\nwith heath''; but this explanation is\ncommonplace when compared with the\nbrilliant guess--``Heathen, from Latin\n`h<ae>thum,' faith, and `en,' not.''\n\nThe boy who explained the meaning of\nthe words _fort_ and _fortress_ must have had\nrather vague ideas as to masculine and\nfeminine nouns.  He wrote:  ``A fort is\na place to put men in, and a fortress a\nplace to put women in.''\n<p 160>\n\nThe little book entitled _English as she\nis Taught_, which contains a considerable\nnumber of genuine answers to examination\nquestions given in American schools, with\na Commentary by Mark Twain, is full of\namusing matter.  A large proportion of\nthese answers are of a similar character\nto those just enumerated, blunders which\nhave arisen from a confusion caused by\nsimilarity of sound in the various words,\nthus, ``In Austria the principal occupation\nis gathering Austrich feathers.''  The\nboy who propounded this evidently had\nmuch of the stock in trade required\nfor the popular etymologist.  ``Ireland is\ncalled the Emigrant Isle because it is\nso beautiful and green.''  ``Gorilla warfare\nwas where men rode on gorillas.''  ``The\nPuritans found an insane asylum in the\nwilds of America.''\n\nSome of the answers are so funny that\nit is almost impossible to guess at the\ntrain of thought which elicited them, as,\n``Climate lasts all the time, and weather\nonly a few days.''  ``Sanscrit is not used\nso much as it used to be, as it went out\nof use 1500 B.C.''  The boy who affirmed\n<p 161>that ``The imports of a country are the\nthings that are paid for; the exports are\nthe things that are not,'' did not put the\nTheory of Exchange in very clear form.\n\nThe knowledge of physiology and of\nmedical subjects exhibited by some of the\nexamined is very amusing.  One boy\ndiscovered a new organ of the body called\na chrone:  ``He had a chronic disease--\nsomething the matter with the chrone.''\nAnother had a strange notion of how to\nspell _craniology_, for he wrote ``Chonology\nis the science of the brane.''  But best\nof all is the knowledge of the origin of\nBright's disease, shown by the boy who\naffirms that ``John Bright is noted for an\nincurable disease.''\n\nMuch of the blundering of the\nexamined must be traced to the absurd\nquestions of the examiners--questions\nwhich, as Mark Twain says, ``would\noversize nearly anybody's knowledge.''\nAnd the wish which every examinee\nhas to bring in some subject which he\nsupposes himself to know is perceptible\nin many answers.  The date 1492 seems\nto be impressed upon every American\n<p 162>child's memory, and he cannot rest until\nhe has associated it with some fact, so\nwe learn that George Washington was\nborn in 1492, that St. Bartholomew\nwas massacred in that year, that ``the\nBrittains were the Saxons who entered\nEngland in 1492 under Julius C<ae>sar,''\nand, to cap all, that the earth is 1492\nmiles in circumference.\n\nMany of the best-known examination\njokes are associated with Scriptural\ncharacters.  One of the best of these, if also\none of the best known, is that of the man\nwho, paraphrasing the parable of the Good\nSamaritan, and quoting his words to the\ninnkeeper, ``When I come again I will\nrepay you,'' added, ``This he said knowing\nthat he should see his face again no more.''\n\nA School Board boy, competing for one\nof the Peek prizes, carried this confusion\nof widely different events even farther.\nHe had to write a short biography of\nJonah, and he produced the following:\n``He was the father of Lot, and had two\nwives.  One was called Ishmale and the\nother Hagher; he kept one at home, and\nhe turned the other into the dessert, when\n<p 163>she became a pillow of salt in the daytime\nand a pillow of fire at night.''  The sketch\nof Moses is equally unhistoric:  ``Mosses\nwas an Egyptian.  He lived in an ark\nmade of bullrushes, and he kept a golden\ncalf and worshipped braizen snakes, and\net nothing but kwales and manna for forty\nyears.  He was caught by the hair of his\nhead, while riding under the bough of a\ntree, and he was killed by his son Absalom\nas he was hanging from the bough.''  But\nthe ignorance of the schoolboy was quite\nequalled by the undergraduate who was\nasked ``Who was the first king of Israel?''\nand was so fortunate as to stumble on\nthe name of Saul.  Finding by the face\nof the examiner that he had hit upon\nthe right answer, he added confidentially,\n``Saul, also called Paul.''\n\nThe American child, however, managed\nto cover a larger space of time in his\nconfusion when he said, ``Elijah was a good\nman, who went up to heaven without\ndying, and threw his cloak down for\nQueen Elizabeth to step over.''\n\nA boy was asked in an examination,\n``What did Moses do with the tabernacle?''\n<p 164>and he promptly answered, ``He chucked\nit out of the camp.''  The scandalised\nexaminer asked the boy what he meant,\nand was told that it was so stated in the\nBible.  On being challenged for the verse,\nthe boy at once repeated ``And Moses\ntook the tabernacle and _pitched_ it without\nthe camp'' (Exod. xxxiii. 7).\n\nThe book might be filled with\nextraordinary instances of school translation,\nbut room must be found for one beautiful\nspecimen quoted by Moore in his\n_Diary_.  A boy having to translate\n``they ascended by ladders'' into Latin,\nturned out this, ``ascendebant per\nadolescentiores'' (the comparative degree of\nlad, _i.e_., ladder).\n\nThe late Mr. Barrett, Musical Examiner\nto the Society of Arts, gave some curious\ninstances of blundering in his report on\nthe Examinations of 1887, which is printed\nin the _Programme of the Society's\nExaminations for_ 1888:--\n\n``There were occasional indications that\nthe terms were misunderstood.  `Presto'\nsignifies `turn over,' `Lento' `with style.'\n`Staccato' was said to mean `stick on\n<p 165>the notes,' or `notes struck and at once\nraised.'\n\n``The names of composers in order of\ntime were generally correctly done, but\nthe particulars concerning the musicians\nwere rather startling.  Thus Purcell was\nsaid to have written, among other things,\nan opera called _Ebdon and Eneas_; one\nstated that he was born 1543 and died\n1595, probably confusing him with Tallis,\nthat he wrote masses and reformed the\nchurch music; another that he was the\norganist of King's College Chapel, and\nwrote madrigals.  One stated that he was\nborn 1568 and died 1695; another, not\nknowing that he had so long passed the\nallotted period of man's existence, gave\nhis dates 1693, 1685, thus giving him no\nlimit of existence at all.  One said he\nwas a German, born somewhere in the\nnineteenth century, which statement\nanother confirmed by giving his dates as\n1817-1846; and, further, credited him\nwith the composition of _The Woman of\nSamaria_, and as having transposed plain-\nsong from tenor to bass.  Bach is said to\nhave been the founder of the `Thames\n<p 166>School Lipsic,' the composer of the\n_Seasons_, the celebrated writer of opera\ncomique, born 16--, and having gone\nthrough an operation for one of his fingers,\nturned his attention to composition, wrote\noperas, and, lastly, that he was born in\n1756, and died 1880, and that his fame\nrests on his passions.\n\n``The facts about Handel are pretty\ncorrect; but we find that Weber wrote\n_Parsifal, The Flying Dutchman, Der Ring\nder Nibulengon_.  His dates are 1813-1883.\nMendelssohn was born 1770, died 1827\n(Beethoven's dates), studied under Hadyn\n(_sic_), and that he composed many operas.\nGounod is said to be `a rather modern\nmusician'; he wrote _Othello, Three Holy\nChildren_, besides _Faust_ and other works.\nAmong the names given as the composer\nof _Nozze di Figaro_ are Donizetti, William\nSterndale Bennett, Gunod, and Sir Mickall\nCosta.  The particulars concerning the\nreal composer are equally interesting.\n(1) His name is spelt Mozzart, Mosarde,\netc.  (2) He was a well-known Italian, wrote\n_Medea_, and others.  (3) His first opera\nwas _Idumea, or Idomeo_.  (4) He composed\n<p 167>_Lieder ohne worte, Don Pasquale, Don\nGovianna_, the _Zauberfloat, Feuges_, and\nhis _Requiem_ is the crowning glory of his\n`marvellious carere.'  (5) He was a\nGerman, `born 1756, at a very early age.'\nIf the dates given by another writer be\ntrue (born 1795, died 1659), it is certain\nthat he must have died before he was\nborn.''\n\nMr. Barrett again reported in 1889\nsome of the strange opinions of those\nwho came to him to be examined:--\n\n``The answers to the question `Who was\nRossini?  What influence did he exercise\nover the art of music in his time?' brought\nto light much curious and interesting\nintelligence.  His nationality was various.\nHe was `a German by birth, but was born\nat Pesaro in Italy'; `he was born in\n1670 and died 1826'; he was a `Frenchman,'\n`a noted writer of the French,'\nthe place of nativity was `Pizzarro in\nGenoa'; he was `an Italian, and made\npeople feel drunk with the sparke and\nrichness of his melody'; he composed\n_Oberon, Don Giovanni; Der Fri<e:>schutz_,\nand _Stabet Matar_.  He was `an accom<p 168>plished\nwriter of violin music and produced\nsome of the prettiest melodies';\nit is `to him we owe the extension of\nchords struck together in ar peggio'; he\nwas `the founder of some institution or\nanother'; `the great aim of his life was\nto make the music he wrote an interpretation\nof the words it was set to'; he\n`broke many of the laws of music'; he\n`considerable altered the stage'; he\n`was noted for using many instruments\nnot invented before'; in his `composition\nhe used the chromatic scale very\nmuch, and goes very deep in harmony';\nhe `was the first taking up the style, and\ntherefore to make a great change in\nmusic'; he was `the cause of much censure\nand bickering through his writings';\nhe `promoted a less strict mode of writing\nand other beneficial things'; and, finally,\n`Giachono Rossini was born at Pezarro\nin 1792.  In the year 1774 there was war\nraging in Paris between the Gluckists and\nPiccinists.  Gluck wanted to do away with\nthe old restraint of the Italian aria, and\nimprove opera from a dramatic point of\nview.  Piccini remained true to the old\n<p 169>Italian style, and Rossini helped him to\ncarry it on still further by his operas,\n_Tancredi, William Tell_, and _Dorma del\nLago_.' ''\n\nThe child who gave the following brilliant\nanswer to the question, ``What was\nthe character of Queen Mary?'' must\nhave suffered herself from the troubles\nsupposed to be connected with the\npossession of a stepmother:  ``She was wilful\nas a girl and cruel as a woman, but'' (adds\nthe pupil) ``what can you expect from any\none who had had five stepmothers?''\n\nThe greatest confusion among the\nexamined is usually to be found in the\nanswers to historical and geographical\nquestions.  All that one boy knew about\nNelson was that he ``was buried in\nSt. Paul's Cathedral amid the groans of\na dying nation.''  The student who mixed\nup Oliver Cromwell with Thomas Cromwell's\nmaster Wolsey produced this strange\nanswer:  ``Oliver Cromwell is said to have\nexclaimed, as he lay a-dying, If I had\nserved my God as I served my king, He\nwould not have left me to mine enemies.''\nMiss Graham relates in the _University\n<p 170>Correspondent_ an answer which contains\nthe same confusion with a further one\nadded:  ``Wolsey was a famous general\nwho fought in the Crimean War, and who,\nafter being decapitated several times, said\nto Cromwell, Ah! if I had only served\nyou as you have served me, I would\nnot have been deserted in my old age.''\n``The Spanish Armada,'' wrote a young\nman of seventeen, ``took place in the\nreign of Queen Anne; she married Philip\nof Spain, who was a very cruel man.\nThe Spanish and the English fought very\nbravely against each other.  The English\nwanted to conquer Spain.  Several battles\nwere fought, in which hundreds of the\nEnglish and Spanish were defeated.  They\nlost some very large ships, and were at a\ngreat loss on both sides.''\n\nThe following description of the Nile\nby a schoolboy is very fine:  ``The Nile is\nthe only remarkable river in the world.\nIt was discovered by Dr. Livingstone, and\nit rises in Mungo Park.''  Constantinople\nis described thus:  ``It is on the Golden\nHorn; a strong fortress; has a University,\nand is the residence of Peter the Great.\n<p 171>Its chief building is the Sublime Port.''\nAmongst the additions to our geographical\nknowledge may be mentioned that Gibraltar\nis ``an island built on a rock,'' and\nthat Portugal can only be reached through\nthe St. Bernard's Pass ``by means of\nsledges drawn by reindeer and dogs.''\n``Turin is the capital of China,'' and\n``Cuba is a town in Africa very difficult\nof access.''\n\nOne of the finest answers ever given in\nan examination was that of the boy who\nwas asked to repeat all he knew of Sir\nWalter Raleigh.  This was it:  ``He introduced\ntobacco into England, and while\nhe was smoking he exclaimed, `Master\nRidley, we have this day lighted such a\nfire in England as shall never be put\nout.' ''  Can that, with any sort of justice,\nbe styled a blunder?\n\nThe rule that ``the King can do no\nwrong'' was carried to an extreme length\nwhen a schoolboy blunder of Louis XIV.\nwas allowed to change the gender of\na French noun.  The King said ``un\ncarosse,'' and that is what it is now.\nIn Cotgrave's _Dictionary carosse_ appears\n<p 172>as feminine, but M<e'>nage notes it as\nhaving been changed from feminine to\nmasculine.\n\nIt has already been pointed out that\nsome of the blunders of the examined\nare due to the absurdity of the questions\nof the examiner.  The following excellent\nanecdote from the late Archdeacon Sinclair's\n_Sketches of Old Times and Distant\nPlaces_ (1875) shows that even when the\nquestion is sound a difficulty may arise\nby the manner of presenting it:--\n\n``I was one day conversing with Dr.\nWilliams about schools and school\nexaminations.  He said:  `Let me give you\na curious example of an examination at\nwhich I was present in Aberdeen.  An\nEnglish clergyman and a Lowland Scotsman\nvisited one of the best parish schools\nin that city.  They were strangers, but the\nmaster received them civilly, and inquired:\n``Would you prefer that I should _speer_\nthese boys, or that you should _speer_ them\nyourselves?''  The English clergyman\nhaving ascertained that to _speer_ meant to\nquestion, desired the master to proceed.\nHe did so with great success, and the\n<p 173>boys answered numerous interrogatories\nas to the Exodus from Egypt.  The\nclergyman then said he would be glad\nin his turn to _speer_ the boys, and began:\n``How did Pharaoh die?''  There was\na dead silence.  In this dilemma the\nLowland gentleman interposed.  ``I think,\nsir, the boys are not accustomed to your\nEnglish accent,'' and inquired in broad\nScotch, ``Hoo did Phawraoh dee?''  Again\nthere was a dead silence, till the master\nsaid:  ``I think, gentlemen, you can't _speer_\nthese boys; I'll show you how.''  And he\nproceeded:  ``Fat cam to Phawraoh at his\nhinder end?'' _i.e_., in his latter days.  The\nboys with one voice answered, ``He was\ndrooned''; and a smart little fellow added,\n``Ony lassie could hae told you that.''\nThe master then explained that in the\nAberdeen dialect ``to dee'' means to die\na natural death, or to die in bed: hence\nthe perplexity of the boys, who knew that\nPharaoh's end was very different.' ''\n\nThe author is able to add to this chapter\na thoroughly original series of answers to\ncertain questions relating to acoustics,\nlight and heat, which Professor Oliver\n<p 174>Lodge, F.R.S., has been so kind as to\ncommunicate for this work, and which\ncannot fail to be appreciated by his readers.\nIt must be understood that all these answers\nare genuine, although they are not\ngiven _verbatim et literatim_, and in some\ninstances one answer is made to contain\nseveral blunders.  Professor Lodge\nexpresses the opinion that the questions\nmight in some instances have been worded\nbetter, so as to exclude several of the\nmisapprehensions, and therefore that the\nanswers may be of some service to future\nsetters of questions.  He adds that of late\nthe South Kensington papers have become\nmore drearily correct and monotonous,\nbecause the style of instruction now\navailable affords less play to exuberant\nfancy untrammelled by any information\nregarding the subject in hand.\n\n\n1880.--ACOUSTICS, LIGHT AND HEAT\nPAPER.\n\n          _Science and Art Department_.\n\n\nThe following are specimens of answers\ngiven by candidates at recent examinations\nin Acoustics, Light and Heat, held in\n<p 175>connection with the Science and Art\nDepartment, South Kensington.  The\nanswers have not of course all been\nselected from the same paper, neither\nhave they all been chosen for the same\nreason.\n\n_Question_ I.--State the relations existing\nbetween the pressure, temperature, and\ndensity of a given gas.  How is it proved\nthat when a gas expands its temperature\nis diminished?\n\n_Answer_.--Now the answer to the first\npart of this question is, that the square\nroot of the pressure increases, the square\nroot of the density decreases, and the\nabsolute temperature remains about the\nsame; but as to the last part of the\nquestion about a gas expanding when its\ntemperature is diminished, I expect I am\nintended to say I don't believe a word\nof it, for a bladder in front of a fire\nexpands, but its temperature is not at all\ndiminished.\n\n_Question_ 2.--If you walk on a dry path\nbetween two walls a few feet apart, you\nhear a musical note or ``ring'' at each\nfootstep.  Whence comes this?\n<p 176>\n\n_Answer_.--This is similar to\nphosphorescent paint.  Once any sound gets\nbetween two parallel reflectors or walls,\nit bounds from one to the other and\nnever stops for a long time.  Hence it is\npersistent, and when you walk between\nthe walls you hear the sounds made by\nthose who walked there before you.  By\nfollowing a muffin man down the passage\nwithin a short time you can hear most\ndistinctly a musical note, or, as it is more\nproperly termed in the question, a ``ring''\nat every (other) step.\n\n_Question_ 3.--What is the reason that\nthe hammers which strike the strings of\na pianoforte are made not to strike the\nmiddle of the strings?  Why are the bass\nstrings loaded with coils of wire?\n\n_Answer_.--Because the tint of the clang\nwould be bad.  Because to jockey them\nheavily.\n\n_Question_ 4.--Explain how to determine\nthe time of vibration of a given tuning-\nfork, and state what apparatus you would\nrequire for the purpose.\n\n_Answer_.--For this determination I\nshould require an accurate watch beating\n<p 177>seconds, and a sensitive ear.  I mount the\nfork on a suitable stand, and then, as\nthe second hand of my watch passes the\nfigure 60 on the dial, I draw the bow\nneatly across one of its prongs.  I wait.\nI listen intently.  The throbbing air\nparticles are receiving the pulsations; the\nbeating prongs are giving up their original\nforce; and slowly yet surely the sound\ndies away.  Still I can hear it, but faintly\nand with close attention; and now only\nby pressing the bones of my head against\nits prongs.  Finally the last trace\ndisappears.  I look at the time and leave\nthe room, having determined the time of\nvibration of the common ``pitch'' fork.\nThis process deteriorates the fork\nconsiderably, hence a different operation must\nbe performed on a fork which is only _lent_.\n\n_Question_ 6.--What is the difference\nbetween a ``real'' and a ``virtual'' image?\nGive a drawing showing the formation of\none of each kind.\n\n_Answer_.--You see a real image every\nmorning when you shave.  You do not\nsee virtual images at all.  The only people\nwho see virtual images are those people\n<p 178>who are not quite right, like Mrs. A.\nVirtual images are things which don't\nexist.  I can't give you a reliable drawing\nof a virtual image, because I never saw\none.\n\n_Question_ 8.--How would you disprove,\nexperimentally, the assertion that white\nlight passing through a piece of coloured\nglass acquires colour from the glass?  What\nis it that really happens?\n\n_Answer_.--To disprove the assertion (so\nrepeatedly made) that ``white light passing\nthrough a piece of coloured glass acquires\ncolour from the glass,'' I would ask the\ngentleman to observe that the glass has\njust as much colour after the light has\ngone through it as it had before.  That is\nwhat would really happen.\n\n_Question_ 11.--Explain why, in order to\ncook food by boiling, at the top of a high\nmountain, you must employ a different\nmethod from that used at the sea level.\n\n_Answer_.--It is easy to cook food at the\nsea level by boiling it, but once you get\nabove the sea level the only plan is to fry\nit in its own fat.  It is, in fact, impossible\nto boil water above the sea level by any\n<p 179>amount of heat.  A different method,\ntherefore, would have to be employed to\nboil food at the top of a high mountain,\nbut what that method is has not yet been\ndiscovered.  The future may reveal it to\na daring experimentalist.\n\n_Question_ 12.--State what are the\nconditions favourable for the formation of dew.\nDescribe an instrument for determining the\ndew point, and the method of using it.\n\n_Answer_.--This is easily proved from\nquestion 1.  A body of gas as it ascends\nexpands, cools, and deposits moisture; so\nif you walk up a hill the body of gas inside\nyou expands, gives its heat to you, and\ndeposits its moisture in the form of dew\nor common sweat.  Hence these are the\nfavourable conditions; and moreover it\nexplains why you get warm by ascending\na hill, in opposition to the well-known\nlaw of the Conservation of Energy.\n\n_Question_ 13.--On freezing water in a\nglass tube, the tube sometimes breaks.\nWhy is this?  An iceberg floats with\n1,000,000 tons of ice above the water\nline.  About how many tons are below\nthe water line?\n<p 180>\n\n_Answer_.--The water breaks the tube\nbecause of capallarity.  The iceberg\nfloats on the top because it is lighter,\nhence no tons are below the water line.\nAnother reason is that an iceberg cannot\nexceed 1,000,000 tons in weight: hence\nif this much is above water, none is\nbelow.  Ice is exceptional to all other\nbodies except bismuth.  All other bodies\nhave 1090 feet below the surface and\n2 feet extra for every degree centigrade.\nIf it were not for this, all fish would die,\nand the earth be held in an iron grip.\n\nP.S.--When I say 1090 feet, I mean\n1090 feet per second.\n\n_Question_ 14.--If you were to pour a\npound of molten lead and a pound of\nmolten iron, each at the temperature of\nits melting point, upon two blocks of ice,\nwhich would melt the most ice, and why?\n\n_Answer_.--This question relates to\ndiathermancy.  Iron is said to be a\ndiathermanous body (from _dia_, through, and\n_thermo_, I heat), meaning that it gets heated\nthrough and through, and accordingly\ncontains a large quantity of real heat.\nLead is said to be an athermanous body\n<p 181>(from _a_, privative, and _thermo_, I heat),\nmeaning that it gets heated secretly or in\na latent manner.  Hence the answer to\nthis question depends on which will get\nthe best of it, the real heat of the iron or\nthe latent heat of the lead.  Probably the\niron will smite furthest into the ice, as\nmolten iron is white and glowing, while\nmelted lead is dull.\n\n_Question_ 21.--A hollow indiarubber ball\nfull of air is suspended on one arm of a\nbalance and weighed in air.  The whole\nis then covered by the receiver of an air\npump.  Explain what will happen as the\nair in the receiver is exhausted.\n\n_Answer_.--The ball would expand and\nentirely fill the vessell, driving out all before\nit.  The balance being of greater density\nthan the rest would be the last to go, but\nin the end its inertia would be overcome\nand all would be expelled, and there would\nbe a perfect vacuum.  The ball would\nthen burst, but you would not be aware of\nthe fact on account of the loudness of a\nsound varying with the density of the place\nin which it is generated, and not on that\nin which it is heard.\n<p 182>\n\n_Question_ 27.--Account for the delicate\nshades of colour sometimes seen on the\ninside of an oyster shell.  State and\nexplain the appearance presented when a\nbeam of light falls upon a sheet of glass\non which very fine equi-distant parallel\nlines have been scratched very close to\none another.\n\n_Answer_.--The delicate shades are due\nto putrefaction; the colours always show\nbest when the oyster has been a bad one.\nHence they are considered a defect and\nare called chromatic aberration.\n\nThe scratches on the glass will arrange\nthemselves in rings round the light, as any\none may see at night in a tram car.\n\n_Question_ 29.--Show how the hypothenuse\nface of a right-angled prism may be\nused as a reflector.  What connection is\nthere between the refractive index of a\nmedium and the angle at which an emergent\nray is totally reflected?\n\n_Answer_.--Any face of any prism may\nbe used as a reflector.  The connexion\nbetween the refractive index of\na medium and the angle at which an\nemergent ray does not emerge but is\n<p 183>totally reflected is remarkable and not\ngenerally known.\n\n_Question_ 32.--Why do the inhabitants\nof cold climates eat fat?  How would you\nfind experimentally the relative quantities\nof heat given off when equal weights of\nsulphur, phosphorus, and carbon are\nthoroughly burned?\n\n_Answer_.--An inhabitant of cold climates\n(called Frigid Zoans) eats fat principally\nbecause he can't get no lean, also because\nhe wants to rise is temperature.  But if\nequal weights of sulphur phosphorus and\ncarbon are burned in his neighbourhood\nhe will give off eating quite so much.  The\nrelative quantities of eat given off will\ndepend upon how much sulphur etc. is\nburnt and how near it is burned to him.\nIf I knew these facts it would be an easy\nsum to find the answer.\n\n\n1881.\n\n\n_Question_ 1.--Sound is said to travel\nabout four times as fast in water as in air.\nHow has this been proved?  State your\nreasons for thinking whether sound travels\nfaster or slower in oil than in water.\n<p 184>\n\n_Answer_(_a_).--Mr. Colladon, a gentleman\nwho happened to have a boat, wrote to a\nfriend called Mr. Sturm to borrow another\nboat and row out on the other side of the\nlake, first providing himself with a large\near-trumpet.  Mr. Colladon took a large\nbell weighing some tons which he put\nunder water and hit furiously.  Every time\nhe hit the bell he lit a fusee, and Mr.\nSturm looked at his watch.  In this way\nit was found out as in the question.\n\nIt was also done by Mr. Byott who sang\nat one end of the water pipes of Paris,\nand a friend at the other end (on whom he\ncould rely) heard the song as if it were a\nchorus, part coming through the water and\npart through the air.\n\n(_b_) This is done by one person going into\na hall (? a well) and making a noise, and\nanother person stays outside and listens\nwhere the sound comes from.  When Miss\nBeckwith saves life from drowning, her\nbrother makes a noise under water, and\nshe hearing the sound some time after can\ncalculate where he is and dives for him;\nand what Miss Beckwith can do under\nwater, of course a mathematician can do\n<p 185>on dry land.  Hence this is how it is\ndone.\n\nIf oil is poured on the water it checks\nthe sound-waves and puts you out.\n\n_Question_ 2.--What would happen if\ntwo sound-waves exactly alike were to\nmeet one another in the open air, moving\nin opposite directions?\n\n_Answer_.--If the sound-waves which\nmeet in the open air had not come from\nthe same source they would not recognise\neach others existence, but if they had they\nwould embrace and mutually hold fast, in\nother words, interfere with and destroy\neach other.\n\n_Question_ 9.--Describe any way in\nwhich the velocity of light has been\nmeasured.\n\n_Answer_ (_a_).--A distinguished but\nHeathen philosopher, Homer, was the first\nto discover this.  He was standing one day\nat one side of the earth looking at Jupiter\nwhen he conjectured that he would take\n16 minutes to get to the other side.\nThis conjecture he then verified by careful\nexperiment.  Now the whole way across\nthe earth is 3,072,000 miles, and dividing\n<p 186>this by 16 we get the velocity 192,000\nmiles a second.  This is so great that it\nwould take an express train 40 years to\ndo it, and the bullet from a canon over\n5000 years.\n\nP.S.--I think the gentlemans name was\nRomer not Homer, but anyway he was\n20% wrong and Mr. Fahrenheit and Mr.\nCelsius afterwards made more careful\ndeterminations.\n\n(_b_) An Atheistic Scientist (falsely so\ncalled) tried experiments on the Satellites\nof Jupiter.  He found that he could\ndelay the eclipse 16 minutes by going to\nthe other side of the earths orbit; in fact\nhe found he could make the eclipse\nhappen when he liked by simply shifting\nhis position.  Finding that credit was\ngiven him for determining the velocity\nof light by this means he repeated it\nso often that the calendar began to\nget seriously wrong and there were\nriots, and Pope Gregory had to set things\nright.\n\n_Question_ 10.--Explain why water pipes\nburst in cold weather.\n\n_Answer_.--People who have not studied\n<p 187>Acoustics think that Thor bursts the pipes,\nbut we know that it is nothing of the kind\nfor Professor Tyndall has burst the\nmythologies and has taught us that it is the\nnatural behaviour of water (and bismuth)\nwithout which all fish would die and the\nearth be held in an iron grip,\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nFOREIGNERS' ENGLISH.\n\nIT is not surprising that foreigners\nshould make mistakes when\nwriting in English, and Englishmen,\nwho know their own deficiencies in\nthis respect, are not likely to be\ncensorious when foreigners fall into these\nblunders.  But when information is printed\nfor the use of Englishmen, one would\nthink that the only wise plan was to have\nthe composition revised by one who is\nthoroughly acquainted with the language.\nThat this natural precaution is not always\ntaken we have ample evidence.  Thus, at\nHavre, a polyglot announcement of certain\nlocal regulations was posted in the harbour,\nand the notice stood as follows in French:\n``Un arrangement peut se faire avec le\npilote pour de promenades <a!> rames.''  The\nfollowing very strange translation into\n<p 189>English appeared below the French:\n``One arrangement can make himself\nwith the pilot for the walking with roars.''\n\nThe papers distributed at international\nexhibitions are often very oddly worded.\nThus, an agent in the French court of\none of these, who described himself as\nan ``Ancient Commercial Dealer,'' stated\non a handbill that ``being appointed by\nTenants of the Exhibition to sell Show\nCases, Frames, &c., which this Court\nincloses, I have the honour to inform\nMuseum Collectors, Librarians, Builders,\nShopkeepers, and business persons in\ngeneral, that the fixed prices will hardly be\nthe real value of the Glasses which adorn\nthem.''\n\nIn 1864 was published in Paris a\npretentious work, consisting of notices of\nthe various literary and scientific societies\nof the world, which positively swarms with\nblunders in the portion devoted to England.\nThe new forms into which well-known\nnames are transmogrified must be seen to\nbe believed.  Wadham College is printed\n_Washam_, Warwick as _Worwick_; and one\nof our metropolitan parks is said to be\n<p 190>dedicated to a saint whose name does\nnot occur in any calendar, viz., _St. Jam's\nPark_.  There is the old confusion respecting\nEnglish titles which foreigners\nfind so difficult to understand; and\nmonsieur and esquire usually appear\nrespectively before and after the names of\nthe same persons.  The Christian names\nof knights and baronets are omitted, so\nthat we obtain such impossible forms as\n``Sir Brown.''\n\nThe book is arranged geographically,\nand in all cases the English word ``shire''\nis omitted, with the result that we come\nupon such an extremely curious monster\nas ``le Comt<e'> de Shrop.''\n\nOn the very first page is made the\nextraordinary blunder of turning the Cambrian\nArch<ae>ological Association into a _Cambridge_\nSociety; while the Parker Society,\nwhose publications were printed at the\nUniversity Press, is entered under\n_Canterbury_.  It is possible that the Latin name\n_Cantabrigia_ has originated this mistake.\nThe Roxburgh Society, although its\nfoundation after the sale of the magnificent\nlibrary of the Duke of Roxburgh is cor<p 191>rectly\ndescribed, is here placed under the\ncounty of Roxburgh.  The most amusing\nblunder, however, in the whole book is\ncontained in the following charmingly\nna<i:>ve piece of etymology _<a!> propos_ of the\nGeological and Polytechnic Society of the\nWest Riding of Yorkshire:  ``On sait qu'en\nAnglais le mot _Ride_ se traduit par\nvoyage <a!> cheval ou en voiture; on pourrait\npeut-<e^>tre penser, d<e!>s le d<e'>but, qu'il s'agit\nd'une Soci<e'>t<e'> hippique.  II n'en est rien;\n<a!> l'exemple de l'Association Britannique,\ndont elle,'' etc.  This pairs off well with\nthe translation of _Walker, London_, given\non a previous page.\n\nThe Germans find the same difficulty\nwith English titles that the French do,\nand confuse the Sir at the commencement\nof our letters with Herr or Monsieur.\nThus, they frequently address Englishmen\nas _Sir_, instead of mister or esquire.  We\nhave an instance of this in a publication\nof no less a learned body than the Royal\nAcademy of Sciences of Munich, who\nissued in 1860 a ``Rede auf Sir Thomas\nBabington Macaulay.''\n\nAn hotel-keeper at Bale translated\n<p 192>``limonade gazeuse'' as ``gauze lemonads\";\nand the following delightful entry\nis from the Travellers' Book of the Drei\nMohren Hotel at Augsburg, under date\nJan. 28th, 1815:  ``His Grace Arthur\nWellesley, Duke of Wellington, &c., &c.,\n&c.  Great honour arrived at the beginning\nof this year to the three Moors.  This\nillustrious warrior, whose glorious\natchievements which cradled in Asia have filled\nEurope with his renown, descended in it.''\nIt may be thought that, as this is not\nprinted, but only written, it is scarcely fair\nto preserve it here; but it really is too\ngood to leave out.\n\nThe keepers of hotels are great sinners\nin respect to the manner in which they\nmurder the English language.  The following\nare a few samples of this form of\nliterature, and most readers will recall\nothers that they have come across in their\ntravels.\n\nThe first is from Salzburg:--\n\n``George Nelb<o:>ck begs leave to recommand\nhis hotel to the Three Allied, situated\n_vis-<a!>-vis_ of the birth house of Mozart, which\noffers all comforts to the meanest charges.\n<p 193>\n\nThe next notice comes from Rastadt:--\n\n          ``ADVICE OF AN HOTEL.\n\n\n``The underwritten has the honour of\ninforming the publick that he has made\nthe acquisition of the hotel to the Savage,\nwell situated in the middle of this city.\nHe shall endeavour to do all duties which\ngentlemen travellers can justly expect;\nand invites them to please to convince\nthemselves of it by their kind lodgings at\nhis house.\n\n               ``BASIL\n                         ``JA. SINGESEM.\n\n          ``Before the tenant of the Hotel to\n                    the Stork in this city.''\n\n\nWhatever may be the ambition of mine\nhost at Pompeii, it can scarcely be the\nfame of an English scholar:--\n\n ``Restorative Hotel Fine Hok,\n     Kept by Frank Prosperi,\n    Facing the military quarter\n               at Pompei.\n\nThat hotel open since a very few days is\nrenowned for the cheapness of the Apart<p 194>ments\nand linen, for the exactness of the\nservice, and for the excellence of the true\nFrench cookery.  Being situated at proximity\nof that regeneration, it will be propitious\nto receive families, whatever, which\nwill desire to reside alternatively into that\ntown to visit the monuments now found\nand to breathe thither the salubrity of the\nair.  That establishment will avoid to all\ntravellers, visitors of that sepult city and\nto the artists (willing draw the antiquities)\na great disorder occasioned by tardy and\nexpensive contour of the iron whay people\nwill find equally thither a complete sortment\nof stranger wines and of the kingdom,\nhot and cold baths, stables, coach houses,\nthe whole at very moderated prices.  Now\nall the applications and endeavours of the\nHoste will tend always to correspond to\nthe tastes and desires of their customers\nwhich will require without doubt to him\ninto that town the reputation whome, he\nis ambitious.''\n\nOn the occasion of the Universal\nExhibition of Barcelona in 1888 the _Moniteur\nde l'Exposition_ printed a description of\nBarcelona in French, German, Spanish,\n<p 195>and English.  The latter is so good that\nit is worthy of being printed in full:--\n\n``Then there will be in the same Barcelona\nthe first universal Exposition of\nSpain.  It was not possible to choose a\nmore favorable place, for the capital-\ntown of Catalonia is a first-rate city open\nto civilization.\n\n``It is quite out of possibility to deny it\nto be the industrial and commercial capital\nof the peninsula and a universal Exposition\ncould not possibly meet in any other\nplace a more lively splendour than in this\nmagnificent town.\n\n``Indeed what may want Barcelona to\ndeserve to be called great and handsome?\nAre here not to be found archeological\nand architectural riches, whose specimens\nare inexhaustible?\n\n``What are then those churches whose\nstyle it is impossible to find elsewhere,\ncontaining altars embellished with truly\nspanish magnificence, and so large and\nimposing cloisters, that there feels any\nman himself exceedingly small and little?\nWhat those shaded promenades, where\nthe sun cannot almost get through with\n<p 196>the golden tinge of its rays? what this\nRambla where every good citizen of\nBarcelona must take his walk at least\nonce every day, in order to accomplish the\ncivic pilgrimage of a true Catalanian?\n\n``And that Paseo Colon, so picturesque\nwith its palmtrees and electric light,\nwhich makes it like, in the evening, a\ntheatrical decoration, and whose ornament\nhas been very happily just finished?\n\n``And that statue of Christopher\nColomb, whose installation will be\naccomplished in a very short time, whose price\nmay be 500,000 francs?\n\n``Are not there still a number of proud\nbuildings, richly ornamented, and splendid\ntheaters? one of them, perhaps the\nmost beautiful, surely the largest (it\ncontains 5000 places) the Liceo, is truly\na master-pi<e!>ce, where the spectators are\nlost in admiration of the riches, the\nornaments, the pictures and feel a true\nregret to turn their eyes from them to\nlook at the stage.\n\n``You will see coffee houses, where have\nbeen spent hundreds of thousands to\nchange their large rooms in enchanted\n<p 197>halls with which it would be difficult to\ncontest even for the palaces of east.\n\n``And still in those little streets, now\nvery few, so narrow that the inhabitants\nof their opposite houses can shake hands\ntogether, do you not know that doors\nmay be found which open to yards and\nstaircases worthy of palaces?\n\n``Do you not know there are plenty of\nsculptures, every one of them masterpieces,\nand that, especially the town\nand deputation house contain some halls\nwhich would make meditate all our great\nmasters?\n\n``If we walk through the Catalonia-\nsquare to reach the Ensanche, our\nastonishment becomes still greater.\n\n``In this Ensanche, a newly-born, but\nalready a great town, there are no streets:\nthere are but promenades with trees on\nboth sides, which not only moderate the\nrays of the sun through their follage, but\npurify the surrounding atmosphere and\nseem to say to those who are walking\nbeneath their shade:  You are breathing\nhere the purest air!\n\n``There display the houses plenty of\n<p 198>the rarest sorts of marble.  Out and\nindoors rules marble, the ceilings of the\nhalls, the staircases, the yards command\nand force admiration to the spectator,\nwho thought to see only houses and finds\nmonumental buildings.\n\n``Join to that a Paseo de Gracia with\nimmense perspective; the promenade of\nCortes, 10 kil. long; some free squares\nby day- and night-time, in which the rarest\nplants and the sweetest flowers enchant\nthe passengers eyes and enbalm his\nsmell.\n\n``Join lastly the neighbourhoods, but a\nshort way from the town and put on all\nsides in communication with it by means\nof tramways-lines and steam-tramways\ntoo; those places show a very charming\nscenery for every one who likes natural\nbeauties mingled with those which are\ncreated by the genius of man.\n\n``After that all there is Monjuich, whose\nproud fortress seems to say:  I protect\nBarcelona: half-way the slope of the\nmountain, there are Miramar, Vista\nAlegre, which afford one of the grandest\npanorama in the world: on the left side,\n<p 199>the horizon skirting, some hills which\nform a girdle, whose indented tops detach\nthem selves from an ever-blue sky; at\nthe foot of those mountains, the suburbs\nwe have already mentioned, created for\nthe rest and enjoyment of man after his\naccomplished duty and finished work;\non the lowest skirt Barcelona in a flame\nwith its great buildings, steeples, towers,\nhouses ornamented with flat terraces, and\nmore than all that, its haven, which had\nbeen, to say so, conquered over the\nMediterranean and harbors daily in itself\na large number of ships.\n\n``All this ideal Whole is concentrated\nbeneath an enchanting sky, almost as\nbeautiful as the sky of Italy.  The climate\nof Barcelona is very much like Nice, the\npretty.\n\n``Winter is here unknown; in its place\nthere rules a spring, which allows every\nplant to bud, every most delicate flower\nto blossom, orangetrees and roses, throughout\nthe whole year.\n\n``In one word, Barcelona is a magnificent\ntown, which is about to offer to the\nworld a splendid, universal Exposition,\n<p 200>whose success is quite out of doubt\ndetermined.''\n\nAt the Paris Exhibition of 1889 a\n_Practical Guide_ was produced for the\nbenefit of the English visitor, which is\nwritten throughout in the most astonishing\njargon, as may be seen from the\nopening sentences of the ``Note of the\nEditor,'' which run as follows:  ``The\nUniversal Exhibition, for whom who comes\nthere for the first time, is a true chaos\nin which it is impossible to direct and\nrecognize one's self without a guide.\nWhat wants the stranger, the visitor who\ncomes to the Exhibition, it is a means\nwhich permits him to see all without\nlosing uselessly his time in the most part\nvain researches.''\n\nThis is the account of the first\nconception of the Exhibition:  ``Who was\ngiving the idea of the Exhibition?  The\nfirst idea of an Exhibition of the\nCentenary belongs in reality not to anybody.\nIt was in the air since several years, when\ndivers newspapers, in 1883, bethought\nthem to consecrate several articles to it,\nand so it became a serious matter.  The\n<p 201>period of incubation (brooding) lasted\nsince 1883 till the month of March 1884;\nwhen they considered the question they\npreoccupied them but about a National\nExhibition.  Afterwards the ambition\nincreased.  The ministery, then presided\nby Mr. Jules Ferry, thought that if they\nwould give to this commercial and industrial\nmanifestation an international character\nthey would impose the peace not\nonly to France, but to the whole world.''\n\nThe Eiffel Tower gives occasion for\nsome particularly fine writing:  ``In order\nto attire the stranger, to create a great\nattraction which assured the success of\nthe Exhibition, it wanted something\nexceptional, unrivalled, extraordinary.  An\nengineer presented him, Mr. Eiffel, already\nknown by his considerable and keen\nworks.  He proposed to M. Locroy to\nerect a tower in iron which, reaching the\nheight of three hundred metres, would\nrepresent, at the industrial sight, the\nresultant of the modern progresses.  M.\nLocroy reflected and accepted.  Hardly\ntwenty years ago, this project would have\nappeared fantastic and impossible.  The\n<p 202>state of the science of the iron\nconstructions was not advanced enough, the\nsecurity given by the calculations was not\nyet assured; to-day, they know where\nthey are going, they are able to count the\nforce of the wind.  The resistance which\nthe iron opposes to it.  Mr. Eiffel came\nat the proper time, and nevertheless how\nmany people have prophetized that the\ntower would never been constructed.\nHow many critics have fallen upon this\naudacious project!  It was erected,\nhowever, and one perceives it from all Paris;\nit astonishes and lets in extasy the\nstrangers who come to contemplate it.''\n\nThe figures attached to the fountain\nunder the tower are comically described\nas follows:--\n\n``Europe under the lines of a woman,\nleaned upon a printing press to print and\na book, seems deeped in reflections.\n\n``America is young woman, energetic and\nvirginal however, characterising the youth\nand the audacies of the American people.\n\n``Asia, the cradle of the human kind,\nrepresents the volupty and the sensualism.\nHer posture, the expression of her figure,\n<p 203>render well the abandonment of the passion\nwith the oriental people.\n\n``Africa represented by a figure of a\nwoman in a timid attitude, is well the\nsymbol of the savage people enslaved by\nthe civilisation.\n\n``Australia finally is figured by a woman\nbuttressed on herself, like an animal not\nyet tamed, ready to throw itself on its\nprey, without waiting to be attacked. . . .\n\n``Above Asia and Africa, the Love and\nthe Sleep, in the shade of a floating\ndrapery.  Finally, between Europe and\nAmerica, a young girl symbolises the\nHistory.''\n\nThe author commences the account\nof his first walk as follows:  ``Thus we\nbegin, at present as we have let him see\nthese two wonderworks which fly at the\neyes, the Tower and the fountain, to return\non his steps to retake with order this walk\nof recognition which will permit him,\nthanks to our watchfulness, to see all in\na short time.''\n\n``The History of the human dwelling''\nis introduced thus:  ``It is the moment\nor never to walk among the surprising\n<p 204>restitution, of which M. Garnier the\neminent architect of the Opera has made\nhim the promoter.  On our left going\nalong the flower-beds from the Tower till\nhere, the constructions of the History of\nthe human Dwelling is unfolded to our\neyes.  The human Dwelling in all countries\nand in all times, there is certainly\nan excellent subject of study.  Without\ndoubt the great works do not fail, where\nconscientious plates enable us to know\nexactly in which condition where living\nour ancestors, how their dwellings where\ndisposed in the interior.  But nothing\napproaches the demonstration by the\nmateriality of the fact, and it is struck\nwith this truth that the organisators of\nthe Exhibition resolved to erect an\nimprovisated town, including houses of all\ncountries and all latitudes.''\n\nThe author finishes up his little work\nin the same self-satisfied manner, which\nshows how unconscious he was that he\nwas writing rubbish:--\n\n``There is finished our common walk,\nand in a happy way, after six days which\nwe dare believe it did not seem to you\n<p 205>long, and tiresome, your curiosity finding\na constant aliment at every step which we\nmade you do, in this exhibition without\nrivalry, where the beauties succeed to\nthe beauties, where one leaves not one\npleasure but for a new one.  As for us,\nour task of cicerone is too agreeable\nto us, that we shall do our best to\nretain you still near us, in efforcing us\nto discover still other spectacles, and to\npresent you them after all those you\nknow already.''\n\nIf it be absurd to give information to\nEnglishmen in a queer jargon which it is\ndifficult for him to understand, what must\nbe said of those who attempt to teach a\nlanguage of which they are profoundly\nignorant?  Most of us can call to mind\ninstances of exceedingly unidiomatic\nsentences which have been presented to\nour notice in foreign conversation books;\nbut certainly the most extraordinary of\nthis class of blunders are to be found in\nthe _New Guide of the Conversation in\nPortuguese and English_, by J. de Fonseca\nand P. Carolino, which created some\nstir in the English press a few years\n<p 206>ago.[14]  The authors do not appear to\nhave had even the most distant acquaintance\nwith either the spoken or written\nlanguage, so that many of the sentences\nare positively unintelligible, although\nthe origin of many of them may be\nfound in a literal translation of certain\nFrench sentences.  One chapter of this\nwonderful book is devoted to _Idiotisms_,\nwhich is a singularly appropriate title\nfor such odd English proverbs as the\nfollowing:--\n\n\n [14] A selection from this book was printed by\nMessrs. Field & Tuer under the title of _English\nas she is spoke_.\n\n\n\n``The necessity don't know the low.''\n\n``To build castles in Espaguish.''\n\n``So many go the jar to spring, than at\nlast rest there.''\n\n(A little further on we find another\nversion of this well-known proverb:  ``So\nmuch go the jar to spring that at last it\nbreak there.'')\n\n``The stone as roll not heap up not\nfoam.''\n\n``He is beggar as a church rat.''\n\n``To come back at their muttons.''\n<p 207>\n\n``Tell me whom thou frequent, I will\ntell you which you are.''\n\nThe apparently incomprehensible sentence\n``He sin in trouble water'' is explained\nby the fact that the translator\nconfused the two French words _p<e'>cher_,\nto sin, and _p<e^>cher_, to fish.\n\nThe classification adopted by the\nauthors cannot be considered as very\nscientific.  The only colours catalogued\nare _white, cray, gridelin, musk_ and _red_;\nthe only ``music's instruments''--_a\nflagelet, a dreum_, and a _hurdy-gurdy_.\n``Common stones'' appear to be _loadstones,\nbrick, white lead_, and _gumstone_.\nBut probably the list of ``Chastisements''\nis one of the funniest things in this Guide\nto Conversation.  The list contains _a fine,\nhonourable fine, to break upon, to tear off\nthe flesh, to draw to four horses_.\n\nThe anecdotes chosen for the instruction\nof the unfortunate Portuguese youth are\nalmost more unintelligible than the rest\nof the book, and probably the following\ntwo anecdotes could not be matched in\nany other printed book:--\n\n``The Commander Forbin of Janson,\n<p 208>being at a repast with a celebrated\nBoileau, had undertaken to pun upon\nher name:--`What name, told him, carry\nyou thither?  Boileau:  I would wish\nbetter to call me Drink wine.'  The poet\nwas answered him in the same tune:--\n`And you, sir, what name have you choice?\nJanson:  I should prefer to be named\nJohn-meal.  The meal don't is valuable\nbetter than the furfur.'''\n\nThe next is as good:--\n\n``Plato walking one's self a day to the\nfield with some of their friends.  They\nwere to see him Diogenes who was in\nwater untill the chin.  The superficies\nof the water was snowed, for the rescue\nof the hole that Diogenes was made.\nDon't look it more told them Plato, and\nhe shall get out soon.''\n\nA large volume entitled _Polugl<o^>ssos_ was\npublished in Belgium in 1841, which is\neven more misleading and unintelligible\nthan the Portuguese School Book.  The\nEnglish vocabulary contains some amazing\nwords, such as _agridulce, ales of troops,\nancientness sign, bivacq fire, breast's pellicule,\nchimney black money, infatuated compass,\n<p 209>iug_ (vocal), _window, umbrella_, etc.  At\nthe end of this vocabulary are these\nnotes:--\n\n``Look the abridged introduction\nexeptless for the english editions, foregoing\nthe french postcript, next after the title\npage.  Just as the numbers, the names\nof cities, states, seas, mountains and\nrivers, the christian names of men and\nwoman, and several synonimous, who\nenter into the composition of many\nenglish words, suppressed in the former\nvocabulary, are explained by the respective\ncategorys and appointed at the general\nindex, look also by these, what is not\nfound here above.''\n\n``_Version alternative_.  See for the shorter\nintroduction exeptless for the english\neditions, foregoing the french postscript\nnext after the title page.  Just as the\nnumbers &c. . . . their expletives are\nbe given by the respective categorys, and\nappointed at the general index, to wich\nis sent back!''\n\nWe are frequently told that foreigners\nare much better educated than we are,\nand that the trade of the world is slipping\n<p 210>through our fingers because we are not\ntaught languages as the foreigners are.\nThis may be so, but one cannot help\nbelieving that the dullest of English\nclerks would be able to hold his own\nin competition with the ingenious youths\nwho are taught foreign languages on the\nsystem adopted by Senhors Fonseca\nand Carolino, and by the compiler of\n_Polugl<o^>ssos_.\n\nGuides to a foreign town or country\nwritten in English by a foreigner are\noften very misleading; in fact, sometimes\nquite incomprehensible.  A contributor\nto the _Notes and Queries_ sent to that\nperiodical some amusing extracts from a\nGuide to Amsterdam.  The following few\nlines from a description of the Assize\nCourt give a fair idea of the language:--\n\n``The forefront has a noble and sublime\naspect, and is particularly characteristical\nto what it ought to represent.  It\nis built in a division of three fronts in\nthe corinthic order, each of them consists\nof four raising columns, resting upon a\ngeneral basement from the one end of\nthe forefront to the other, and supporting\n<p 211>a cornish, equalling running all over the\nface.''[15]\n\n\n     [15] _Notes and Queries_, First Series, iii 347.\n\n\n\nWhen it was known that Louis XVIII.\nwas to be restored to the throne of France,\na report was circulated that the Duke of\nClarence (afterwards William IV.) would\ntake the command of the vessel which was\nto convey the king to Calais.  The people\nof that town were in a fever of expectation,\nand having decided to sing _God save\nthe King_ in honour of their English visitor,\nthey thought that it would be an additional\ncompliment if they supplemented it with\nan entirely new verse, which ran as\nfollows:--\n\n ``God save noble Clar<e'>nce,\n   Who brings our King to France,\n     God save Clar<e'>nce;\n   He maintains the glor<y'>\n   Of the British nav<y'>,\n   Oh God, make him happ<y'>,\n     God save Clar<e'>nce.''[16]\n\n\n     [16] _Ibid_., iv. 131.\n\n\nIn continuation of the story, it may be\nsaid that the Duke did not go to Calais,\n<p 212>and that therefore the anthem was not\nsung.\n\nThe composer of this strange verse\nsucceeded in making pretty fair English,\neven if his rhymes were somewhat deficient\nin correctness.  This was not the case\nwith a rather famous inscription made by\na Frenchman.  Monsieur Girardin, who\ninscribed a stone at Ermenonville in\nmemory of our once famous poet Shenstone,\nwas not stupid, but rather preternaturally\nclever.  This inscription is\nabove all praise for the remarkable manner\nin which the rhymes appeal to the eye\ninstead of the ear; and moreover it shows\nhow world-famous was that charming\ngarden at Leasowes, near Halesowen,\nwhich is now only remembered by the\nfew:--\n\n\n         ``This plain stone\n        To William Shenstone.\n     In his writings he display's\n           A mind natural.\n         At Leasowes he laid\n        Arcadian greens rural.''\n\n\n\nDr. Moore, having on a certain occasion\nexcused himself to a Frenchman for using\n<p 213>an expression which he feared was not\nFrench, received the reply, ``Bon monsieur,\nmais il m<e'>rite bien de l'<e^>tre.''  Of these\nlines it is impossible to paraphrase this\npolite answer, for we cannot say that they\ndeserve to be English.\n\n\n\n\nINDEX.\n\nAdder _for_ nadder, 7.\nAfghan _for_ Anglican, 148.\nAgassiz, _Zoological Biography_, blunder in, 64.\nAlison's (Sir Archibald) blunder, 34.\nAmpulle (Sainte), 35\nAmsterdam, Guide to, 210.\nAnderson (Andrew), his disgraceful printing of the Bible, 141.\nApostrophe, importance of an, 121.\nApron _for_ napron, 7.\n_Arabian Nights_, translations of, 45.\nArden (Pepper), 60.\nArlington (Lord), his title taken from the village of Harlington, 8.\nArtaxerxes, 54.\nAsh's Dictionary, 9, 10.\nAverrhoes, 54.\n\nBabington's (Bishop) _Exposition of the Lord's Prayer_, 92.\n_Bachaumont, M<e'>moires de_, 33.\nBaly's (Dr.) translation of M<u:>ller's _Physiology_, 51.\n\n<p 216>\n\nBarcelona Exhibition (1883), 194\nBarker (Robert) and Martin Lucas fined for\n     leaving _not_ out of the Seventh Commandment, 136.\nBellarmin, misprints in his works, 79.\nBenserade's joke, 97.\nBible, blunders in the printing of the, 135.\n----incorrect translations of passages in, 58.\n----the ``Wicked'' Bible, 136.\n_Bibliographical Blunders_ 63 - 77\nBismarck's (Prince) endeavours to keep on good\n     terms with all the Powers, 145.\nBlades's (W.) _Shakspere and Typography_, 104.\nBlunder, knowledge necessary to make a, 2.\nBlunders, amusing mistakes, 1.\n_Blunders in General_, 1-30.\n----_of Authors_, 31 -46.\n----_of Translators_, 47-62.\n----(_Bibliographical_), 63-77.\n----(_Schoolboys_'), 157-187.\nBoehm's tract on the Boots of Isaiah, 71.\nBoyle (Robert) becomes Le Boy, 72.\nBrandenburg (Elector of) and Father Wolff, 20.\nBrathwaite's (R.) _Strappado for the Divell_, 94.\nBreton's (Nicholas) tracts, 81.\n----_Wit of Wit_, 93.\n_Bride (La) de Lammermuir_, 49.\nBrigham le jeune _for_ Brigham Young, 67.\nBritton's _Tunbridge Wells_, 37.\nBroch (J.
