Names, characters, companies,\nproducts, places, and incidents are either the product of the\nauthor's imagination or are used fictitiously, and any\nresemblance to actual persons, living or dead, events, companies\nand/or products, or locales, is entirely coincidental.\n\n\n\nDEDICATION\n\nThis novel is dedicated\nto the loving memory of my father\n\nStephen M. Hutsko\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE ELECTRONIC EDITION\n\n\"What a long, strange trip it's been.\"\n-- The Grateful Dead\n\n\nAs nearly as I can remember, I began writing this novel in the\nsummer of '88, after leaving my job at Apple Computer, Inc.,\nwhere I worked for almost four years for former Apple chairman\nJohn Sculley, as his personal technology advisor. It was a neat\njob title and a lot of fun, but somewhere in there I decided I\nwanted to become a novelist. Eight years and two title-changes\nlater, the first novel that I set out to write, known these days\nas \"Undo,\" is finally available to readers in this special\nelectronic edition, free of charge.\n\n\nElectronic books, or e-texts, have been available for some time\nnow so this is hardly groundbreaking news. Or is it? For me,\nit's a pretty big deal. Primarily because the electronic books\nthat are available to download from the Internet, the World Wide\nWeb, and online services such as CompuServe and America Online,\nwere published previously in hardback or paperback editions, or\nboth. Bruce Sterling's \"The Hacker Crackdown: Law and Disorder on\nthe Electronic Frontier,\" for example, was first published in\nhardback by Bantam in 1992, then in 1993 in paperback, also by\nBantam. Sterling wisely retained the electronic rights to his\nbook so that he may - electronically speaking - do as he pleases\nwith his work. To the best of my knowledge, Sterling is the first\nauthor to give away his published, in-print book for free on the\nNet.\n\nI don't know how many people who download e-books actually read\nthem from cover-to-cover, though I suspect the number is rather\nlow. Mainly because the medium isn't as easy on the eyes as\ntraditional paper-based books. I would bet that most people who\ndownload e-books - and I'm talking about novels, vs. reference\nworks - browse them part of the way, then delete them from their\ncomputer or PDA. As for works of non-fiction, such as Sterling's\nbook, or the enormously serviceable \"Elements of Style\" (which\nhas recently appeared in e-book format), readers refer to these\nworks on a need-to-know basis. But novels, they're another story.\nA novel is something you curl up with and, if it's a good one,\nlose yourself in, much the way Alice found herself getting lost\nin that fantastic looking glass. Perhaps the valuable thing about\npublishing a novel as an e-text is that it gives readers a taste\nfor the story and for the author's style, so that the reader can\nthen go out and purchase the published edition if they want to.\n\nBut let's get back to \"Undo,\" and why making it available for\nfree in this electronic book version is so important to me. The\nreason is simple: I want people to read it, and this is - so\nfar, anyway - the only way to make that happen. For, despite the\nhard-fought efforts of not one, not two, but three very reputable\nliterary agents, the book, unlike Mr. Sterling's works, has not\nfound a trade publisher it can call home.\n\nWhy? The answer to this question is best summed up by Bantam\neditor Brian Tart, in his recent letter of rejection:\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nMs. Juliet Nicolson\nJuliet Nicolson Ltd. Literary Agency\n71 Chester Row\nLondon England SW1W 8JL\n\n\nDear Juliet:\n\n\n\nThank you for dropping off Joe Hutsko's ms. while you were in New\nYork. I must say that I am impressed with Mr. Hutsko's writing\nand believe him to be a talent to watch in the future. His story,\nhowever, seemed to me to be a bit stale - it seems to be about\nsix or eight years too late in the making - as I could see, and\nindeed have seen, this kind of corporate intrigue take place in\nthe world of non-fiction. Because the plot was not as timely as\nit would need to be to succeed in the commercial marketplace, I\nwill have to pass.\n\nPlease do keep me informed of Mr. Hutsko's projects, should he\ndecide to embark upon writing another ms.\n\nSincerely,\n [Signed]\nBrian Tart\nAssociate Editor\n\n\nEnc.\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\n\n\nGive or take a few sentiments, the gist of Mr. Tart's\nencouraging but ultimately downer letter was repeated by all of\nthe top trade publishing houses. A number of enthusiastic editors\n- in particular a young editor named John Michel, who pleaded\nwith his senior editors to acquire the novel first at\nHarperCollins, then later when he moved to Crown (and who has\nsince become a friend, so something good has survived those\nbattles) - tried their best to acquire the book, and in one case\nan offer was extended to my then-agent, but then two days later\nthe publisher backed out, apologizing that the editor who'd made\nthe offer was in no position to do so, please forgive the error\nin our ways.\n\nThe really troubling thing for me was that when I set out to\nwrite my novel, another novel called \"The Bonfire of the\nVanities,\" by Tom Wolfe, had taken the reading population by\nstorm. Was not Mr. Wolfe's novel inspired by real-life, by the\nbond trading schemes that at the time were making front page\nnews? Readers of fiction turned the book into a best-seller, and\nas one of those readers, I cannot say that I would have read the\nbook were Tom Wolfe to have written it as a non-fiction title.\nThat it was inspired by actual characters and events, and turned\nby Wolfe's expert hands into a compelling modern-day tale of\nmurder and mortality, were enough to convince me that I could\npull off the same sort of magic with my own \"what if\" scenario,\nswapping Silicon Valley for New York, and the personal computer\nbusiness for bond trading.\n\nThat this was my first attempt at writing a novel goes a long way\ntoward explaining the earliest rejections of the work, then\ntitled \"Silicon Dreams,\" by editors unlucky enough to have had it\nland with a thud on their desks. Somehow I'd lost sight of Mr.\nWolfe's excellent illustration and found myself mimicking, all at\nonce, the likes of Sidney Sheldon, Arthur Hailey, Jackie\nCollins, and, believe it or not, Stephen King (who happens to be\nmy favorite mainstream read). With so many influences at play in\nthe already befuddled head of an aspiring young writer with\ndreams of hitting the number one spot on all of the best-seller\nlists, you (and of course I, this much later) can understand how\nmy storytelling ability left something to be desired.\n\nStill, I pressed on, heeding suggestions I believed were valid\n(such as: \"How dare you kill that character in the middle of the\nbook just because you don't know what to do with her next!\").\nMore than once I put the whole thing on the shelf to give it, and\nmyself, a breather; to put a little space between us so that our\nrespective flaws could be considered the next time around with a\nclearer, colder eye. Four rewrites later, including a\nno-holds-barred excising, I finally had a book, still known then\nas \"Silicon Dreams,\" that I believed was as good as it was going\nto get.\n\nAnd then it happened. A publisher bought it. I had the literary\ncritic Digby Diehl to thank for this good news. At the time Digby\nwas a book reviewer for \"Playboy,\" and also a daily book\ncolumnist for the Prodigy online service (where I'd done a brief\nstint ghost writing for a highly paid high-tech analyst who will\nremain unnamed). Via e-mail I asked Digby if he'd read my novel\nand, if he liked it, to suggest editors who may want to take a\nlook at it. Well, Digby'd read it and liked it - enough to\npersonally pass it along to the head of a new and\nsmall-but-going-for-the-big-time publisher named Knightsbridge\nPublishing, an imprint distributed by the reputable Hearst\nCorporation. Knightsbridge was founded around the time of the\nGulf War, and made its killing, so to speak, with a mass market\npaperback best-seller, \"The Rape of Kuwait.\"\n\nThe deal was for both hardback and paperback rights, and the\npublisher himself called me to offer $5000 for the whole package,\nwhich I came close to accepting. However, I knew that money\nmatters were best handled by my agent - despite the fact that I\nhad fired her a few months earlier for not having sold the novel\nherself. Fortunately she forgave me my actions and signed me back\nup, compelling Knightsbridge to increase its offer to $25,000.\n\nToo bad neither of us ever saw most of that money.\nUnfortunately, Knightsbridge went out of business - but not\nwithout first boosting my expectations through the exhilarating\nprepublication process. I was assigned a marvelous editor named\nLynette Padwa, whose keen suggestions helped me to make the book\na better read. There was even a glossy lavender and gold embossed\nbook jacket with my photo on back atop Digby Diehl's encouraging\nblurb, and two months before the publication date I received my\nfirst bound galley copy, to double-check for typesetting errors\nbefore it went off to the printer. The prepublication buzz\nstarted up, and a Hollywood producer named Andrew Karsch, who'd\njust released \"The Prince of Tides\" with Barbra Streisand, was\nconsidering buying a film option on the novel to adapt for a\npossible a feature film or television miniseries. And just when\nthings couldn't possibly look brighter, they did, when both\nKirkus Review and Publishers Weekly asked to see advance reader's\ncopies of the book.\n\nAnd then the impossible dream turned into a nightmare. I should\nhave known the end was near when instead of receiving the\nsigning advance in one lump sum, as agreed upon, it was coming in\nsmaller and smaller portions (and then only after my hounding the\naccounting department every day telling them my rent and phone\nbill were late). You see, I wanted to believe. It was difficult\nenough to accept that this was finally happening to me - that my\nfirst novel was about to be published in hardback to building\nfanfare. To think otherwise, that something might stop the novel\nfrom being published, wasn't a \"happy thought,\" and anything but\nhappy thoughts, my agent advised, would seep disagreeably into\nthe novel's successful launch. But unhappy did things turn when\nKnightsbridge announced that it was closing shop.\n\nBut I was not to be put off. Armed with ten bound galleys, my\nagent appealed to several hardback publishers...and when they\nall said no - in almost every case for the same reasons Brian\nTart at Bantam gave us - we tried paperback publishers, lowering\nour expectations and hoping then for a paperback original deal.\nTwice we came close. First Ace, then Berkley, however editors at\nboth houses met resistance from editorial boards who felt that\nthe novel would find no audience.\n\nFeeling dejected and down on my luck, I had to blame someone for\nthis conspiracy, so once again I contacted my agent and told her\nI would be seeking representation elsewhere. This time she told\nme she wouldn't take me back if I changed my mind, and who could\nblame her. My next agent, who'd left an old and very successful\nNew York literary agency to start her own agency, was young and\nfresh and building a name for herself as one to watch in the\nbusiness, with editors chasing her all over the floor at the\nfirst American Booksellers Association conference she attended on\nher own. She had a more focused approach: Talk up the book to a\nfew editors she knew very well and try to get something of a\nrivalry going for it - before any of them even read it.\nBrilliant thinking; this was the kind of agent I wanted on my\nside. Shooting for freshness, we decided to change the novel's\ntitle from \"Silicon Dreams\" to \"Double Click,\" and off it went to\nthe waiting editors. The long and short of it: Neither Random\nHouse nor Viking wanted it. Adding insult to injury, one even\nsuggested that if I were to write a non-fiction book he would\npublish that. What a depressing thought.\n\nBefore she'd signed me up, my agent and I had agreed to treat our\nrelationship as a trial agreement. After the rejection, I decided\nthat though she was fast becoming a very hot agent, mainstream\nfiction wasn't her area of expertise; what I really, really\nneeded was an agent who represented best-selling mainstream\nauthors.\n\nMy friend Gloria Nagy, a splendid novelist with seven novels\nunder her belt (one of which, \"Looking for Leo,\" is on its way to\nbecoming a CBS miniseries), put me in touch with her then-agent,\nEd Victor, who is based in London, and enjoys a long client list\nof acclaimed literary and mainstream authors. After Gloria's\nintroduction, I sent my novel to Ed Victor, and although he'd\nrejected the novel six years ago, suggesting it needed a lot of\nwork (advise I took to heart), this time he responded positively,\nsaying he had enjoyed it.\n\nYet, because his client list was so full and active, he was at\nthe time not taking on new fiction writers. He did however\ndirect me to an agent named Juliet Nicolson, with whom he had\nbegun a working alliance, and to whom he would be happy to send\nmy novel for consideration. A spirited British woman, Juliet had\nlived and worked in publishing in the United States for many\nyears, and had decided to return to London to start her own\nagency. Several weeks later she faxed me to say that she\nthoroughly enjoyed the novel, and that Ed Victor lends his full\nsupport to her should I decide to have her represent me. I called\nher back thirty seconds later and shouted \"Yes,\" and, another\nlong and short of it, despite their combined efforts, their long\ncareers of landing huge book deals, the novel \"Double Click\"\nstill found no publishing house.\n\nAfter sending the novel to a long list of hardback publishers,\nthen trying, as before, to secure a paperback original deal,\nJuliet felt it was time to put the book away and concentrate on\nmy next novel, which I had in fits and starts tried to get off\nthe ground for the last however many years. She stressed that\nsomeday we would sell \"Double Click,\" possibly after my next\nnovel or the one after that, and assured me that this was how\nfirst novels sometimes turned out (after all, although John\nGrisham's blockbuster \"The Firm\" made him a household name, his\nfirst novel was the small-press-published \"A Time to Kill,\" which\nDoubleday/Dell then rereleased to astonishing success). So I put\n\"Double Click\" away once more and went back to writing the video\ngame strategy guides I'd found my way into to pay the rent, and\nthat was the end of that...\n\nFor about six months, anyway.\n\nThen I was struck by an idea: To rewrite \"Double Click\" just one\nmore time, but this time around, fix the number one complaint\nthat editors had voiced: That the story was too dated. So instead\nof playing out the trials and tribulations of my characters on a\nstage set in the by-now commonplace (and therefore, predictable)\npersonal and mainframe computer market, I decided to shift the\nbackdrop to a more modern setting: advanced handheld computers\nand pocket communicators, also known as PDAs, or personal digital\nassistants.\n\nI told my agent none of this, and quietly set to reworking the\nplot and backdrop to accommodate my change of heart. To make the\nstory feel fresh to me I changed most of the characters names,\nbut other than that each of their stories and struggles remained\nthe same. To ensure that I didn't date the story before I even\nfinished it, I wove in a number of not quite ready for prime time\ntechnologies, including practical speech synthesis and voice\nrecognition. The final rewrite in effect put the novel ever so\nslightly into the future, and as far as I could tell squashed\nthe criticism that the story was too stale.\n\nTaking my agent by complete surprise, I sent her the new\nmanuscript, which I had retitled \"Undo\" (a contemporary term,\nrecognizable to readers, that represents the novel's premise and\nthe underlying theme at play in each of the primary characters'\nlives - and, a little closer to home, sums up my own story in\ntrying to turn around the mysterious forces that have stood in\nthe way of getting this novel published). Well, she was shocked,\nto say the least, and complimented me on my patience and\nperseverance.\n\nWhile my agent was busy reading and considering what to do with\nthe new and improved \"Undo,\" I'd begun, and have since\ncompleted, my second novel, \"r.g.b.\" The book's first chapter,\nwhich I'd written a few years ago, was excerpted in a small\nliterary journal called \"Puck,\" and represents for me my \"other\"\nstyle of writing, which, for lack of a better word, I can only\ndescribe as more...intricate and challenging to read, less\nmainstream.\n\nWhich brings us to the present. Because \"r.g.b.\" is not what my\nagent - make that, former agent - considers commercially viable,\nshe has decided to drop me as a client, suggesting with a wish of\ngood luck that I find myself an agent who wants to represent both\nof my \"voices\" - the mainstream style of \"Undo,\" and the less\nmainstream style of \"r.g.b.\"\n\nSo, here we are. My old friend John Michel has offered to help me\nfind a new literary agent, and I'm about to begin writing a\nscreenplay called \"Misguided Angel\" that I've wanted to write\nfor years. Plus, I'm already thinking about the second screenplay\nI'll write after that, and the next mainstream novel, and the\nnext less mainstream novel too. So I'm anything but down for the\nfinal count.\n\nHave I learned anything in all these years? Tons. For one thing,\nmy first two agents weren't so unfit after all - each did the\nbest job she could in trying to sell the novel, and in the end\neven my third, highly esteemed agent met with the same\nresistance that the previous two encountered. Second, the\npublishing business is more a mystery to me than ever. That this\nbook has not found a home has somehow turned in my heart from a\ntroubling fact of life, to something of a testament to optimism,\na proud eccentricity, a character-building battle scar of sorts.\nI suppose that's just how we fragile beings adapt to unrealized\nexpectations, dashed hopes. Still, having just completed my new\nnovel, I'm all juiced up and feeling groovy, raring to give it\nanother go - after all, it's all anyone who decides to try to\nmake a living telling stories can do...try, try again.\n\nWill \"Undo\" ever find its way between the sheets of pulpy paper\nand glossy covers? Will it ever find its way onto the big\nscreen, or, if I had my choice, the little screen? And, perhaps\nmost important of all, does this novel really matter to anyone\nbesides me? The first two questions I have no way of knowing the\noutcomes of - both are in Fate's all-knowing hands and only time\nwill tell.\n\nAs for that last question, whether this novel matters to anyone\nbesides me, I can only answer by saying I hope so.\n\nWhat you're about to read is a novel I have labored over for a\nvery long time. It gives me great pleasure to hand it over, once\nand for all, to you, gentle reader, whoever, and wherever you\nare. I hope you like it.\n\nJoe Hutsko\n76703.4030@compuserve.com\nJanuary, 1996\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n\nIt was once a sprawling flatland, dominated by fruit tree\norchards and nestled safely between protective hills.\n\nThis tranquil scene slowly vanished as trees were felled,\nconcrete poured, and new seeds planted, each the size of a large\nbeetle and filled with thousands of microscopic circuits, sown by\na new breed of farmer, with dreams of growing the future.\n\nThe new electronic produce, capable of performing millions of\ncalculations in the blink of an eye, was harvested.\n\nThe new technology farmland: Silicon Valley.\n\nViewed from high above, the Valley looks like a schematic\ndrawing of the very seeds from which it has grown, thousands of\ntechnology orchards, connected by the roads and highways etched\ninto the golden surface of the land.\n\n\n\nPART I\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n\nAs he guided the black BMW coupe onto Highway 280, Matthew Locke\nfelt as though his mind was spinning as quickly as the wheels\npropelling him onward. Whether the one functioned as precisely as\nthe other did not occur to him.\n\nAppraising his position, he wondered why there were so few cars\nto contend with this afternoon. Having lived in Northern\nCalifornia for more than two years, he had never headed home on\n280 without confronting ricocheting tail lights, jockeying for\nposition in the fast lane. Bright sunlight and warm air rushed\nthrough the sunroof and windows as he gained speed and activated\nthe cruise control upon reaching sixty-five miles per hour.\n\nThen Matthew noticed the clock, and he remembered he was two\nhours ahead of the commuter traffic that congested the highway\nevery day. He also remembered why.\n\nHe took a few deep breaths to relax his nerves. He had tried one\nlast time, to no avail, to compromise with Peter Jones, the\nstubborn young founder of Wallaby Computer, Incorporated.\n\nMatthew Locke did not want things to end like this. Not exactly.\nBut there was no alternative. The confrontation that had just\ntaken place was more like a vicious counseling session between a\ndistressed married couple than a meeting between two senior\nexecutives of the decade's most important and innovative high\ntechnology company.\n\nMatthew had informed his secretary Eileen that he was walking\nover to Peter Jones's office to try to talk with him one last\ntime about the upcoming board of directors meeting. As Matthew\nneared Peter's building, his anxiety sharpened. He paused for a\nmoment and thought about his place at that very instant,\nstanding at the very center of the Peter Jones legacy.\nSurrounding Matthew were a number of Spanish-style, single-story\nbuildings, each painted white and topped with a red tile roof.\nWhat began as a seedling idea in a garage nearly a decade ago had\nblossomed into the cluster of buildings stretching a quarter-mile\nin either direction from where he stood, and even farther, to a\nnumber of locations throughout the world. And now he was on his\nway to the epicenter of this campus-like complex that was Wallaby\nComputer. Matthew arrived from his journey west with the feeling\nthat he had entered a fairy tale, so full of wonder was this\nplace. But now, as he resumed his step along the gently curving\nsidewalk that ran up either side of the block, he felt as though\nthe set were changing. Full of dread, he approached the end, and\nthe beginning, of the rainbow, where he would confront the man\n\"Time\" magazine called the \"Computer Wizard.\"\n\nPeter's secretary cut short her phone conversation the moment she\nsaw Matthew.\n\n\"Peggy, is Peter in?\"\n\nBefore she could respond, Peter's own voice answered from behind\nhim. \"No!\"\n\nMatthew turned just in time to see Peter's office door slam\nshut. He knocked gently.\n\n\"Nobody's home,\" said Peter Jones in a calm voice from behind the\nclosed door. \"Please leave a message at the tone. Beep.\"\n\nMatthew Locke was not amused. Like a father exercising his right\nto open any door in his own home, he entered the office.\n\nHe was met with the sound of continuous clicking from Peter's\nkeyboard. The office was small and sparsely furnished, with\nsimple overstuffed furniture and gray carpeting. Peter was\nsitting before his computer at a black lacquered desk against the\nwall, his back turned to Matthew. He closed the door behind him\nand waited for Peter to turn around.\n\n \"Nobody's home,\" Peter repeated over the sound of his staccato\ntyping.\n\nMatthew eased himself into the chair beside the couch,\nremembering the first time he had sat in this very office, more\nthan two years ago, when Jones had hired him to run the company.\nMy God, Matthew thought, how he has changed - how everything has\nchanged.\n\nAll at once, the room was silent. Peter Jones turned around in\nhis chair.\n\nOne thing had not changed: Peter's eyes. Deep and black and\nseemingly bottomless, certain and sharply focused, like the eyes\nof a young boy determined to win a swimming race. Matthew felt\nhis toes grip at nothingness inside his dock shoes, felt his feet\nslide silently backward a fraction of an inch across the natty\ncarpet, as if he were taking a step back from the edge of the\nboard for fear of diving once again into that dark pool. And with\nthis thought came another...of water, and splashing, thrashing,\nlosing grip... Loss. Determined, Matthew quickly sobered himself\nof the troubling memories that had momentarily distorted his\nfocus.\n\nHe stood. \"Peter, unless you and I can come to some\nunderstanding about how we're going to run the business, I'm\ngoing to suggest some drastic changes at tomorrow's board\nmeeting.\" To avoid Peter's eyes he glanced at the computer\nscreen.\n\nPeter smoothly turned the screen's dimmer knob and stared at\nMatthew. \"There'll be some changes, all right,\" Peter said.\n\nThe gravity of the younger man's tone went unnoticed by Matthew.\nHis attention had been captured by what he'd seen on the screen\nbefore it darkened. It appeared that Peter was working on some\nsort of graphic. A drawing with little boxes. Probably a sketch\nof a new computer design, Matthew concluded. The pang of pity he\nfelt changed to frustration when he recognized the root of the\nproblem: Why can't he understand that this is exactly what he\nshould be doing, designing new computers, and let me run the\ncompany?\n\n\"It's too late for any more discussion,\" Peter said, flicking\naway the shock of dark brown hair hanging over his brow. \"I know\nall about your plan to suggest a reorganization, Matthew. What,\nyou're surprised? I know everything that goes on here.\" He made a\ndisgusted noise. Then, as if to signal the end of the\ndiscussion, he took a pen in hand and directed his attention to a\nlegal pad. With intense concentration, he began drawing a line\nspiraling round and round from the middle of the page outward.\n\n\"It's not too late. That's what I'm trying too tell you,\"\nMatthew said. \"I don't think you realize the severity of things\naround here. How bad it's gotten.\"\n\nPeter began humming a tune to himself.\n\n\"The board is very disturbed about the schedule slips, and\nfurthermore, the weak sales - \"\n\nPeter's meditation ended. The pen flew within inches of\nMatthew's face. He leaped to his feet. \"Don't you dare come into\nmy office and tell me how to run my company.\" The younger man was\nall tensile, his body resonating with indignation. \"Now leave me\nalone! Just get out of here!\"\n\nMatthew held his place. \"Peter, please.\"\n\n\"Out!\"\n\nIt was hopeless. There was no way Matthew would be able to reach\nhim. \"Okay, Peter,\" Matthew said with a resigned sigh. \"You\nwin.\"\n\nThe room was silent. Peter stood there with his eyes closed,\nwaiting for Matthew to go.\n\nMatthew turned to leave, then paused, his hand on the door\nlatch. He waited half a minute, until Peter opened his eyes and\nlooked at him.\n\n\"What?\" Peter asked, wearily.\n\n\"That's what I want to know.\"\n\n\"What's what you want to know?\"\n\n\"What went wrong. Why.\" Prepared for more flailing, Peter's\nreaction surprised him.\n\nWithout looking at Matthew, Peter came toward him. He picked up\nthe pen he had moments before used as a missile. He lowered\nhimself down onto the sofa and casually crossed one leg over the\nother. He held the pen bearing the Wallaby logo by each end\nbetween his fingers. Emphatically, yet softly, he explained. \"You\ndon't understand. You just don't get it. You don't know the truth\nabout inventing products like Wallaby's. In the long run, it's\nall that really matters. That the products are true to the\nvisions that inspire them.\" He gently placed the pen in his\npocket, shrugged. His glazed eyes drifted across the room to rest\non his docked Joey. \"My visions are my products.\"\n\nHe remained there for a few moments with a rapt, slightly\nsmiling expression lighting his face, gone inside himself to a\nplace where, the way he saw it, everything was sharp and clear,\nwhere he could see things no one else could see.\n\nThe only thing Matthew saw was a man gone. Gone mad, perhaps.\nAlthough they'd had arguments in the past, Peter had never seemed\nso unhinged. In a way, Matthew felt relieved. Having witnessed\nPeter's distracted state, he was resolved to proceed with his\nplan.\n\nThe young founder blinked. He looked at Matthew with clear eyes.\nHe was back. He bit his lower lip, and with an expression at once\nsad and perplexed, he said, \"What is it that you see, Matthew?\nWhat is your vision?\"\n\nThe car phone jingled, snapping Matthew out of his musing.\n\nWas it Peter? If so, he could turn around at the next exit and be\nback in just a few minutes. Though he had every intention of\nproceeding with his plan as it now stood, Matthew would\nnevertheless give Peter until the very last minute to see things\nhis way.\n\n\"Peter?\"\n\n\"Matthew, it's Eileen.\" His secretary. \"I called Peter's office.\nPeggy said you left ten minutes ago. What happened?\"\n\n\"I've decided to go home for the rest of the day,\" he said. \"If I\nhave any calls - \"\n\n\"You already do. Laurence Maupin.\"\n\n\"Is it urgent?\"\n\n\"The two of you were scheduled to discuss tomorrow's meeting.\nShe's in your office now, holding on the line.\"\n\n\"Okay. Put her on.\"\n\nThere was a click, then Laurence's voice. \"Hi, Matthew. I've\nprepared a short press release to send over the business wire\nafter tomorrow's board meeting.\" She spoke quickly, considerate\nof his time. \"It reads: 'Wallaby Computer, Incorporated today\nannounced a realignment of executive responsibilities. In\naddition to his current position as president and CEO, Matthew\nLocke will now assume the responsibilities of chairman of the\nboard, and vice president of the Joey division...'\"\n\nAt this last, his heart suddenly quickened. \"'Peter Jones,\nformer chairman and cofounder of Wallaby, will stay on as the\ncompany's leading visionary, focusing on advanced technologies\nand future product designs.'\n\n\"Still there?\" she asked, giving him an opportunity to comment.\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\nShe continued immediately. \"'Locke has expressed great\nconfidence in Jones's ability to drive Wallaby to the position of\ntechnology leader in the desktop computer and personal\ninteractive assistant industry.'\" When she finished reading\nMatthew's statement, she paused. \"Is that suitable?\"\n\n\"Yes. That's fine. Thank you.\"\n\n\"If you'd like to conduct any phone interviews with key press\nconstituents, I'll need to know that now so I can make\narrangements.\"\n\n\"No. None. What you've done is fine for all parties.\"\n\nHe waited to be sure she was through, then said, \"Thank you,\nLaurence.\" Before taking her call he had been eager to be alone\nso he could mentally review his plan, but now he felt oddly\nunwilling to end their conversation. Something about her voice,\nthe words about him spoken so decidedly, was having a softening\neffect on his anxious mood.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said, \"when this settles down, let's spend some time\ntogether to work on my strategy for the press and Wallaby's new\nPR plans.\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\n\"Great. And thanks again,\" he said. With nothing left to discuss,\nhe said good-bye. As he moved the phone from his ear he heard her\ncall his name. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"I almost forgot,\" she said, slightly exasperated. \"Where do you\nget your car serviced?\"\n\n\"My car?\" Matthew said, a little dumbfounded.\n\n\"Yes. My steering is making a terrible noise. It's a BMW, like\nyours. Well not exactly like yours. I mean, mine is a lot\nsmaller.\"\n\n\"Wallaby does mine,\" Matthew said. \"They arrange for its service,\nnear my house. The place is called Bavaria Motor Systems, in\nWoodside. It's just off Woodside Road.\"\n\n\"Right. I know where that is,\" Laurence said. \"It sounds more\nlike a high tech company than a car shop, doesn't it? I'm finally\ngetting used to all these sys's and gen's and tech's and mem's,\"\nshe said with a chuckle.\n\nHer laughter caught Matthew by surprise. Until now, Laurence had\nconducted herself in a strictly-business fashion. In light of the\nseriousness of the situation he faced with Wallaby, her easy\nlaughter was a welcome breath of fresh air. He hadn't heard\nlaughter, or laughed himself, in a long time. He thought of\nperhaps thanking her for... But for what? For laughing? Sure.\n\n\"Well, again, thank you, Laurence,\" Matthew.\n\n\"No, thank you,\" she said. \"And Matthew, you can call me Lauri if\nyou like. It makes things less formal.\"\n\n\"All right. Good-bye, Lauri...\" And for the second time he heard\nher call his name as he went to hang up the phone. \"Now what?\" he\nsaid, affably.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Matthew. There's one more thing. The picture in your\noffice, of your wife and her horse. Where is that? I mean, where\ndoes she keep her horse?\"\n\n\"You ride? I had no idea. It's Woodside Ranch. About a half-mile\nnorth of the BMW shop. There's a turnoff, with a sign. You can't\nmiss it. That it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\n\"You're sure?\" He laughed. \"Okay, then. Good-bye.\" He snapped the\nphone back onto its cradle and settled into the comfort of the\nleather seat. Tomorrow's meeting. The press. The future.\nLaurence's certainty and control helped him strengthen his own\nhold on the immediacy of tomorrow's meeting, and his overall\nplan.\n\nHis plan. He'd spent the past six months analyzing and plotting\nits current phase. If the vote was successful, Peter Jones would\nbe removed from his position as Wallaby's chairman and\nengineering division vice president. Company-wide responsibility\nwould be turned over to Matthew.\n\nAll the pieces were in place. To begin with, Matthew had gained\ntentative agreement from Wallaby's vice chairman, Hank Towers, to\nconsider \"repositioning\" Peter within the company. He had then\nspent many hours with each member of the executive staff over the\nlast several months, subtly gaining their confidence as he\nexplained his strategy for the company's future, one that would\nincrease Wallaby's profitability and competitive position in the\nindustry.\n\nDissolving the executive staff's confidence in Peter Jones as a\nleader, while building its trust and gaining its loyalty for\nhimself as company president, had been an extremely delicate\noperation. Resistance from even one member of the executive staff\ncould have prevented his plan from advancing to its present\nplace.\n\nThe first phase of Matthew's plan, to gain support after his\narrival at Wallaby, had been successful. He had become a credible\nand qualified champion of Wallaby's high technology platform of\ncomputer products, a status he would have never reached without\nPeter's focused coaching and friendship.\n\nJust a year and a half earlier, \"Business Week\" had touted Peter\nand Matthew as \"The Brains and Brawn of Silicon Valley.\" Gracing\nthe cover was a jocular photo of the two, an insightful,\nundisguised shot whose overall effect was similar to that of a\nHollywood buddy film promotion poster. On the left stood Peter,\nwearing jeans and a white Oxford shirt. His shirtsleeves were\nrolled to the elbow and his arms were folded nimbly across his\nchest. Of slight build and tenuous stance, his physical composure\nwas that of a lanky high school student, yet his eyes had the\ndepth of a twenty-coat lacquer finish. They were the eyes of a\nman older than his years, whose mind performed at a\ncycles-per-second rate equal to that of three men combined. He\nwas thirty-one.\n\nBeside Peter stood Matthew, one arm hung loosely over the younger\nman's shoulder. He wore khaki pants and a chambray work shirt\nwhose sleeves, like Peter's, were rolled to the elbows. The\nsparse, light-brown hair, high, time-worn forehead, and the\ncreases of his face, especially around the eyes, did not belie\nhis age. His eyes, more gray than blue, burned with the\ndetermination of a college graduate who, with diploma fresh in\nhand, sprints eagerly toward The Challenge. He was forty-two.\n\nTensions began to surface just six months after that cover shot\nappeared on newsstands, when after its introduction, the Joey\npersonal interactive assistant met with only mild commercial\nsuccess. Though the device won accolades from the industry for\nPeter and his team of engineers for its breakthrough technology,\nbuyers were skeptical. The dream that Peter shared with Matthew\nin their first meeting was to make the Joey the hottest-selling\nportable computer device in the world, displacing market share\ncompletely dominated by Wallaby's biggest competitor,\nInternational Computer Products.\n\nThe dream was never realized. Though users of ICP's own\nbest-selling portable computer admitted that the Joey was\ntechnically more innovative and expertly designed, there were few\nkey software applications available for it at the time of its\nintroduction. At the root of the delay was a frustrating paradox:\nWhile the Joey was by far the easiest to use portable interactive\nassistant, it was also the most difficult computer to develop\nsoftware programs for. The Joey employed a radical new method of\noperation and many of the software developers had trouble\nlearning the new system. As sales of the Joey dropped off, the\npressure on Peter's team grew more intense. Enhancements that\nwould make the Joey easier to develop programs for were behind\nschedule, and Matthew held Peter responsible for the delays.\n\nDuring this precarious period, Peter ran for cover. Embarrassed\nby his own shortsightedness, he left Matthew to contend with\nWallaby's share-sensitive executives and board members. It wasn't\nunnatural for the president of a company to contend with its\nboard of directors, but it was radically different from the way\nthings had worked at Wallaby in the past. Peter Jones held a dual\nrole as chairman of the board and vice president of the Joey\ndivision. Until the development dilemma, Peter had always been\nthe primary voice in front of the board. So while Peter recovered\nfrom his temporary loss of balance, Matthew soothed board\nmembers' nerves by committing all of his energies to building a\nstrategy that would move Wallaby back into a secure, high-sales\nposition. He assured them that Peter was on track and would come\nthrough with the necessary improvements. He produced impressive\ndevelopment trend studies that described how it often took two\nyears for a new product to gain market acceptance. His methodical\nEast Coast style had an interesting effect on the anxious\nprincipals: They believed him. In the past, Peter has wowed them\nwith his enthusiasm and technological prowess. There had never\nbeen cause to question the young man's business acumen; the\ncompany was less than ten years old and had been profitable for\njust as long. But suddenly, Peter's passionate efforts seemed\nempty; the numbers were declining. Those numbers needed turning\naround, and Matthew was the board's man. Now that he had their\nconfidence, it was time to give them an ultimatum.\n\nIt was really quite simple. Matthew would propose that Peter be\nremoved as the leader of both Wallaby and the Joey group. Matthew\nwould personally oversee the accelerated development of the new\nJoey Plus, enforcing a strict schedule to complete its design and\nproduction in just three months. Matthew knew Peter that would be\nutterly shocked by his proposal at tomorrow's meeting. Though\nPeter would be stripped of all his power, Matthew hoped that\nafter his feelings healed, the executive staff and board of\ndirectors would be able to persuade him to concentrate his\nvisionary skills in a research capacity, which Matthew could draw\nupon when the core Joey technology began showing signs of\nobsolescence.\n\nTo fulfill his promise to fix the company's stalled position,\nMatthew intended to unify the engineering groups, ending the\nelitist conditions Peter had created when he began developing the\nJoey more than three years ago. Peter had chosen only the\nbrightest, most proven people and moved his new team to a private\nbuilding, which he had surrounded with tight security. Only the\nJoey team had been allowed to enter the building, a first in\nWallaby history. Before the Joey project, employees had been free\nto enter every building. Most employees had no reason to enter\nbuildings other than those in which they worked, but the freedom\nof being allowed to do so represented the company's trust in its\npeople. Matthew, of course, was free to roam wherever he pleased,\nand he instantly understood the reason for Peter's rule the first\ntime he entered the off-limits building. Peter had created a\nproject-team paradise. The Joey engineers were supplied with\nexotic and luxurious amenities that Peter felt nurtured their\ncreativity and rewarded them for their intense work.\n\nMatthew intended to put an end to the Joey team's Club Med work\nenvironment by integrating it with the company's other\nengineering divisions. A newly consolidated engineering division\nwould focus its energies on expediting completion of the Joey\nPlus.\n\nIn the quiet of his own car, the plan seemed logical and simple.\nBut as he thought about tomorrow's meeting and about the\nconfrontation that would ensue, he became aware of the dampness\nunder his arms and his flush face.\n\nHe changed lanes as he passed the Woodside exit. High golden\nhills, peppered every ten or so acres with colossal mansions,\npassed on either side as sidled to the right lane. Passing the\nauto repair shop, he thought of Laurence Maupin. She had been\nhired into the newly created position as his personal public\nrelations assistant one month ago. The timing was perfect for\npositioning her loyalties in his favor. He had revealed to her\nhis plan for tomorrow's meeting, and asked her to secretly\nprepare his press statement under the assumption that everything\nwould go perfectly. There was no guarantee that tomorrow's board\ndecision would favor him over Peter, yet he was betting his\ncareer on his plan. He reminded himself of his discussion with\nLaurence a few minutes earlier, about the over-and-done-with tone\nof her voice as she read Matthew his statement on the other end\nof the line, speaking in a nearly conspiratorial tone as she sat\nin his office, holding his telephone in her hand. He felt his\nspirits lift.\n\nHe felt something else lift, too. His mind's eye fixed on an\nimage of the young and beautiful Laurence sitting at his desk,\nher hand clasped around his handset, her lips close to the\nmouthpiece, her words forging a new alliance between them. He\nfocused on his memory of her hands. Was there enough time? He\npressed his palm to his groin and considered opening his trousers\nand taking care of himself, as he sometimes did on his way home\nfrom work. Usually the act required about as much time as it took\nto reach the Palo Alto exit, but he had passed that turnoff miles\nago and was nearly home. No, he would have to let his desire go\nunsatisfied...though instead of letting go, he indulged his\nimagination anyway, a little longer, fantasizing. Had she touched\nhis computer while she sat there talking to him? Had she rested\nher soft, pretty hand on his mouse and slipped its pointer across\nthe screen to his private folders, opened his files? The only\nother hands as lovely as hers were those of his wife...\n\nWere.\n\nAnd with that recollection, his daydream terminated. He had\narrived at the beginning of the road that wound its way up to his\nhome. The car's transmission automatically down-shifted as it\nclimbed. And so did his mood. As if commiserating with the\nmachinery that had helped him reach this point, Matthew let out\nan exhausted sigh.\n\nOn either side he passed huge concrete gates that fronted the\nestates of some of the most powerful entrepreneurs and business\npeople in Silicon Valley, including Peter, whose home was only a\nhalf-mile from his own. It had been more than six months since he\nhad been to Peter's home. And ever since Matthew's wife Greta had\ntold him more than a year ago that she did not want Peter in her\nhouse again, Matthew and Peter spent less and less time together.\nRecently they had only seen each other in formal meetings.\nLooking back now, Matthew was actually appreciative for his\nwife's restriction. After all, had it not been for her, he might\nnever have distanced himself far enough from Peter to get where\nhe could realize his own power.\n\nHe made a mental note. When all of this was settled, he would do\nsomething nice for her.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nReaching for the door handle of the dark blue 500SL convertible,\nthe parking attendant was momentarily struck with a small\nsurprise: A rather gaudy but finely tailored purple gloved hand,\nwildly flapping at him like some exotic bird. Before he had a\nchance to open the door, the woman to whom the gloved hand\nbelonged was climbing out of the car. She was dressed in black\ndesigner sweats and lavender sport sneakers. Purple sunglasses\nshielded her eyes, and a madras scarf protected her hair from the\nwind. As she turned and reached inside the car for her purse, the\nattendant understood at once, from this angle, that she was not\nwearing this outfit to pursue an athletic regimen. Still in his\nfirst two weeks of summer employment, he had begun to regard the\nladies who shopped here with amusement and fascination. He paid\nspecial attention to mannerisms and hair color. The intended\noverall look sought by women like this one was, he had come to\nbelieve, that of carefree, understated elegance. Most of them\npulled it off beautifully. But this one? Not quite. The gloves\nwere definitely a first, and a definite give away. She wasn't the\ntype, he was certain of it. Too unrefined.\n\nOr so he thought, until she removed her scarf. He observed the\nloose chestnut ringlets of hair, which appeared to be her natural\ncolor. Pausing for a moment, she casually shook down the curls,\nwhich were surprisingly long and appeared soft to the touch. At\nthe same time she pointed her face directly up into the shaft of\nsunlight cutting through the rows of large buildings on either\nside of the street, and with obvious pleasure basked in the\nwarmth for an instant. The effect was striking, as though the\nrays somehow transformed her into something more attractive,\nwhich imposed a temporary snag in his analysis. Until she spoke.\n\n\"I'll be just a few secs,\" she said, gesturing at the store with\nher Chanel wallet. \"I have to pick something up.\"\n\n\"Of course, madam,\" the attendant said, touching his hat. Indeed,\nthe woman's tone was all wrong, too rough, as was her accent, or\nlack thereof. Yes, his initial estimation was correct. Her wealth\nwas definitely nouveau. The worst wealth of all.\n\nA second attendant smiled as he opened the large glass door that\nannounced Gump's, in gold leaf lettering. Removing her\nsunglasses, she headed straight for the elevator. As she waited\nfor its arrival, she lifted an antique hand mirror from a\ndisplay. Taking in her own reflection, she shook her hair and\nchecked her teeth. Her brown, Bette Davis eyes grew even more\nexpansive at the discovery of a pinpoint blemish just above her\neyebrow. She touched it and clucked. Swearing under her breath,\nshe returned the mirror to the glass counter and replaced her\nsunglasses. She had to get out of these bright lights.\n\nA bell chimed, signaling the arrival of the elevator. Turning\nfrom the counter, she noticed a small, smiling elderly woman.\n\n\"Madam, can I show you some of our other fine silver mirrors?\"\n\nGreta Locke spun to hold the elevator door open. Wearing an\nexpression intended to come off as playful, she turned back to\nthe saleswoman. But when she noticed the woman staring at her\ngloved hand holding the jutting elevator door, Greta's response\nwas anything but playful. \"The last thing I need is an expensive\nsilver mirror to remind me to stop eating chocolate.\"\n\nShe boarded the elevator.\n\n\"Why Mrs. Locke, what a pleasant surprise!\" said the attractive\nsalesman, all smiles, as Greta approached. He stood before the\nSteuben crystal room situated at the end of the mercifully\nsubdued second level. Behind him there stood a row of ghostly\nilluminated glass cases containing spectacular pieces of some of\nthe world's finest crystal. His modest platinum name badge said\nhe was Mr. William Armond.\n\n\"Billy,\" Greta said, pausing one step before proceeding past him,\n\"there's something I'd like to see in the Houston collection.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Mr. Armond said, trailing her. He glanced at his\nassociate, Ms. Olson, whose territories were the Lalique and\nBaccarat rooms. Reluctant to catch his eye, she pursed her lips\nand busied herself at her desk, addressing small, golden\ncatalogs.\n\nGreta Locke was Mr. Armond's best customer, one of Gump's best\ncustomers, and everyone who worked there knew it. She had spent\nseveral hundred thousand dollars at Gump's in the two years Mr.\nArmond had had the good fortune of knowing her. Last year she had\narranged a deal between Gump's and Wallaby, Incorporated, to\npurchase corporate gifts at a special quantity discount. A\ndiscount of five percent can be quite sizable, she noted to her\nhusband, when he purchased eight Steuben flower vases last year\nas Christmas presents for the wives of the Wallaby board members,\nat four hundred dollars apiece.\n\nShe removed her sunglasses and studied the curves and artwork of\na large bowl displayed in the glass case. She'd had her eye on it\nfor some time now. It was a James Houston original, engraved with\npainstaking detail. Circling the bowl's rim were salmon swimming\nagainst an invisible current, surrounded by tiny air bubbles. The\npiece was breathtaking.\n\n\"Perhaps a closer inspection?\" Mr. Armond said, producing a small\nring of keys. But before he managed to insert the small key into\nthe case's lock, Greta stopped him.\n\n\"Don't bother. I'll take it.\"\n\n\"A splendid piece, Mrs. Locke,\" he said. \"May I have it\ngift-wrapped for you?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"That's not necessary.\" Without removing her\ngloves, she deftly slid her credit card out of her wallet and\nhanded it to him. \"It's a gift to me. For all my hard work.\" She\nlingered behind him as he moved to his clerk's desk. \"Anything\nnew?\" she asked, over her shoulder.\n\n\"There are some lovely new crystal animals,\" said Mr. Armond,\nindicating one of the other cases. The collection consisted of\nexquisite, palm-size creatures. A dog...a cat...a bird...a bear.\nAll resting peacefully on a black velvet blanket.\n\nShe seemed uninterested; she'd gotten what she came for. However,\nas she was exiting the parlor, a little farther along the\ndisplay, she saw something, reclining on a green felt pasture,\nthat captivated her attention. Larger than the other pieces, but\nsmall enough to hold in two hands, there lay a knobby colt, its\ntranslucent mane flared back from its muscular neck, forever\nfrozen in the wind. She thought of her own horse, a gift from\nMatthew when they had moved to California. Wouldn't this crystal\nbeauty look wonderful beside her bed, on the night stand....\n\nShe remembered her car, double-parked out front. Another day\nperhaps, she decided, seating herself before Mr. Armond at an\nantique table while he called downstairs and instructed one of\nthe vault attendants to have the piece brought to her.\n\n\"Billy, I've worked so hard,\" she said, fingering her forehead\nabove her eyebrow. \"This is my reward.\"\n\n\"Of course you have,\" Mr. Armond said. \"The piece you have\npurchased is one of a limited number created by Mr. Houston.\nHe'll be pleased to know it will be enjoyed by you and Mr.\nLocke.\"\n\n\"People just don't know how difficult it is being married to a\nsuccessful businessman. It absolutely drains a woman. I swear, I\nfeel like half the time I do his thinking.\" She removed her right\nglove and inspected her nails, and, as the credit card machine\nbeeped twice, she casually turned hand over, palm up, to receive\nthe sales slip.\n\nMr. Armond transcribed the approval code onto the form and handed\nher the pen. As she signed her name, he mentally calculated his\nfive-percent commission on the sale: $1,200.\n\nMs. Olson, carrying the small catalogs in a stack that reached\nfrom her midriff to her chin, managed a polite nod as she passed.\n\n\"Darling,\" Greta called, pointing in Ms. Olson's direction with\nher index finger.\n\nAs the saleswoman turned, her expressionless face metamorphosed\ninto a struggled smile. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"Can I please have one of those?\"\n\n\"Madam, I am certain you will receive one in the mail shortly,\"\nMs. Olson said. She blinked delicately, twice.\n\n\"I want it now.\"\n\nMr. Armond jumped from his seat. \"Of course.\" He slid one from\nthe pile. Quickly discarding the little protective jacket, he\nhanded the booklet to Greta, who immediately began flipping\nthrough it.\n\n\"Thank you, dear,\" she said, without looking up.\n\nMr. Armond returned the addressed, empty coverlet to Ms. Olson's\npile and sent her off with a grateful wink. He collected the\ncord-wrapped box containing her new bowl from a stock attendant,\nand handed it to Greta. \"Anything else today, Mrs. Locke?\"\n\n\"I think this is all for today.\"\n\n\"Always a pleasure, Mrs. Locke.\"\n\nShe strolled out onto Post Street, the pleasantly heavy box\nbeneath one arm. Her car had been moved several yards up the\nblock and into a loading zone. She waved her scarf to the parking\nattendant, but he was already on his way to the vehicle.\n\nHe held the car door for her, and she placed the box on the\npassenger seat and secured it with the seat belt. Tying her\nscarf, she realized she had forgotten the catalog. She had left\nit on the clerk's desk. No fuss. She would receive one in the\nmail soon anyway.\n\nClimbing into the car, she smiled, recalling the day she drove it\noff the parking lot. Another little gift to herself, for all her\nhard work.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nNow that Matthew Locke was gone from his office, Peter Jones\ntwisted the brightness knob on his computer monitor and returned\nto his work.\n\nBeneath his hand he rolled the mouse and pressed its single\nbutton, causing the screen to scroll. Small connected boxes drawn\non the electronic document rolled from the bottom of the display\nto the top. He stopped when he arrived at the top of the chart.\nWith the pointer he selected the uppermost box and clicked the\nmouse twice on the name that currently occupied it. Peter looked\nat the highlighted name for a moment, then pressed the Delete\nkey. MATTHEW LOCKE disappeared instantly.\n\nPeter smiled to himself at the literalness of this small,\neffortless action, of deleting from his computer the very man who\nthreatened to ruin its bright future. He typed in his own name\ninto the vacant box and, beneath it, added the word ACTING before\nthe title that was already there, PRESIDENT & CEO. Beneath this\nbox were others, connected to the uppermost with straight black\nlines, each titled with the name of the corresponding division\nvice president. His name was titled in one of these other boxes\nas, VICE PRESIDENT, JOEY.\n\nThe man Peter had hired two years ago to act as his partner had\nfailed. Matthew Locke's role at Wallaby, defined by Peter and\nHank Towers, Wallaby's cofounder and vice chairman, was to act as\nthe company's business leader and Peter's assistant. While Peter\nunderstood the power of his own vision and the importance of his\nskill at inventing remarkable products, he admitted to himself\nthat he lacked the business experience to develop the company\nfrom a handful of engineers to a large and profitable\norganization. Which was why he had decided to hire Matthew Locke.\n\nBut something had gone wrong.\n\nMatthew, for all of his management strength, did not fit in at\nWallaby the way Peter would have liked. Looking back, he\nremembered Matthew's suggestion, about a year ago, that perhaps\nWallaby's portable computers could become more compatible with\nICP's systems. That was what had started Peter wondering if, in\nthe long run, Matthew was right for Wallaby. Dismissing Matthew's\nidea as a naive insult, Peter only wished now that he had paid\nbetter attention. How could Matthew think Wallaby should abandon\nits founding vision of giving high technology power to the\nindividual with a personal computer or portable interactive\nassistant in favor of creating mere peripherals that connected to\nICP's dictatorial, impersonal desktop and mainframe computers?\nWhat's more, at about this time their friendship began to\ndeteriorate. Up until the disagreement over the company's\ndirection, the two had spent nearly every Saturday afternoon\ntogether, going for long walks or drives. Apparently because of\nPeter's reaction, Matthew stopped spending Saturday afternoons\nwith him. When Peter would ring the gate bell at Matthew's\nmansion, the housekeeper would divulge that Mr. and Mrs. Locke\nhad gone out for the day. Peter had felt wounded. Matthew had\nbeen the first person with whom he had experienced any sort of\nreal friendship. Or so he'd thought. Scolding himself for having\nallowed his feelings to become personal, he displaced his hurt by\npouring himself more intensely into his work, in an all-out\neffort to substantiate his side of the contention that had cost\nhim his only friend.\n\nThe real challenge now was to get the Joey Plus quickly out the\ndoor and into the user's hands and, put to rest once and for all\nthe criticism the original Joey had received. The Joey personal\ninteractive assistant was the product of three years of hard work\nand engineering magic. Peter, the inventor of the original\nWallaby Mate personal computer, had created the Joey as a\nradically different and intuitively designed portable computer.\nNamed after the Australian word for baby kangaroo, the Joey was\ncompact and thin and easy to transport, and it lasted for days on\na single charge. In its simplest configuration, the basic Joey\nwas about the size of a slender hardback book and almost as\nlight, and it slipped easily into a briefcase. It worked as\neither a traditional notebook computer, or as a keyboard-less\nslate computer, and its built-in modem made it easy to access\non-line services and the Internet, or send and receive faxes.\nUsers interacted with Joey using either a stylus by \"drawing\"\ndirectly on its color active-matrix screen, or with the full-size\nkeyboard and trackpad that stealthily slid out from its\nunderside. Or with a combination of both stylus and keyboard, if\nthey preferred. That was what made the Joey so unusual and\ncompelling - its flexibility. Especially when the owner returned\nwith it to the office, or took the Joey home. There, the Joey\nattached easily to a variety of snap-on peripherals that turned\nthe base unit into a more powerful desktop system. Expanded\nkeyboards. Mice. Monitors. Printers. Scanners. CD-ROM players.\nStereo speakers. Enhanced network peripherals. And most any other\nperipheral device available for ordinary personal computers.\n\nBut the machine had its faults. Though it was technically\nsuperior to ICP's portable computers, software developers\nhesitated to invest the costly technical and human resources\nrequired to create new programs for it. Because its design was so\nnew and different, many software developers were fearful of\nstraying beyond the safe boundaries of developing programs for\nanything but ICP's series of computers, regardless of their\nplain-vanilla functionality. In the few short years since they\nhad become players in the portable computer industry, ICP had\nattained an installed base of millions of portable systems\nworldwide, which dwarfed the few hundred thousand Joey systems\nWallaby had sold since its introduction. To a software developer,\nICP's user base numbers were too great to ignore, regardless of\nwhat the future potential of a device like the Joey might be.\n\nPeter clicked the print button on the computer screen. The laser\nprinter on his desk hummed. A few moments later the revised\ncompany organization chart rolled out of the printer.\n\nNowhere in the drawing did Matthew Locke's name appear.\n\nIn tomorrow's board meeting, Peter intended to surprise the team\nby proposing his newly drawn organization. Peter himself would\ntemporarily fill the president-and-CEO slot until a qualified\nreplacement was found. Though Peter had spent little time with\nthe members of his executive staff over the past few months, he\nknew that they had faith in him. He was their leader, the\ncompany's crown jewel. In founding his company he had founded an\nindustry, one that had made every member of his senior executive\nstaff a multimillionaire. Without a doubt, their loyalties rested\nwith him. Any other possibility never occurred to him; he had too\nmany more significant issues to contend with, like leaky\nbatteries.\n\nLeaving his office, Peter stopped for a moment to appreciate the\nsharp and elegant lines of the Joey prototype resting on the\nshelf beside his desk. In just two months, according to his plan,\nthe world would finally benefit from his original Joey vision:\nthe new Joey Plus. His plan for providing the Joey engineering\ngroup with more engineers was precisely what was going to move it\noff his shelf and onto buyers' desktops.\n\nPeter's secretary Peggy looked past her computer screen as she\nheard his office door close.\n\n\"I'm leaving for the day,\" he said.\n\nPeggy had worked for Peter since the company began. She had been\nnineteen years old then, a year younger than Peter, and one of\nthe first employees in the company. Like Peter, she had attained\nmassive wealth when the company had had its public stock\noffering. She wore a colorful Wallaby T-shirt and jeans, and one\nwould never guess that this young woman, worth slightly more than\none million dollars, was executive assistant to the man who had\nstarted the fastest growing new market in the computer industry.\nHowever, looking at Peter's longish hair, customary faded blue\njeans and Oxford shirt, would anyone guess that he was worth\neight hundred million dollars?\n\nBefore heading to his car, Peter decided it wouldn't hurt to\nbolster his confidence in his plan by checking the status of a\nfew key Joey Plus projects.\n\n\"How's it coming?\" Peter asked, leaning over an engineer's\nshoulder.\n\n\"Good,\" Paul Trueblood answered. He blew at the trails of smoke\nthat rose before him as he lifted a soldering iron.\n\n\"I think I've got the battery problem fixed.\" The engineer\nreturned his attention to the electronic components scattered\nabout his worktable.\n\n\"Great,\" Peter said, noticing the pile of tiny batteries beside\nthe main Joey unit. Each was charred with a caramel-colored\nresin. In the original Joey design the battery was located too\nclose to the power recharger unit, and occasionally the excessive\nheat caused the battery to leak and burn.\n\nPeter had tremendous faith in Paul and his work, and he was one\nof the first engineers who had started the company with Peter.\nThe battery problem would be fixed, and thinking about it\nreminded Peter of a similar problem that Paul had corrected\nseveral years ago, in the all-in-one Mate personal computer.\nUnlike the Joey's battery, which powered the unit away from the\ndesktop, the Mate's battery was deep inside the computer, and its\nsole purpose to keep track of the date and time when the computer\nwas turned off. During extended use, the Mate's interior would\noccasionally reach high temperatures, causing the tiny battery to\nleak. The obvious solution was to install a small cooling fan\ninside the computer, like every other brand of computer had. But\nPeter wouldn't allow it. They said it couldn't be done, that you\ncouldn't build a computer without putting in a small noisy fan to\nkeep it cool. \"If they say it can't be done, that's because\nthey're not smart enough to figure out a way to do it,\" was\nPeter's standard reply. That was how Peter Jones challenged his\nengineers to do the impossible. After two days of no sleep, and\nhaving sustained himself on soda and popcorn, Paul had revealed\nto Peter a design that would cool the machine by natural\nconvection.\n\nPeter leaned in over Paul's shoulder for a closer look. \"I'd sure\nhate to see us go back to the drawing board on that sweet little\npower recharger...\" he said, hanging a mild warning in the\nburnt-smelling air of the engineer's office.\n\n\"No problem,\" Paul said, and blew out a breath that hinted mild\nfrustration. Not catching the drift, Peter stayed right where he\nwas, perched over the engineer like a hawk. Paul set down the\nsoldering iron and retrieved a Walkman from his drawer. Loading a\ntape into it, he held the headphones just above his ears and\nraised his eyebrows at Peter, as if to ask if he had any more\ncomments.\n\n\"All right, all right,\" Peter said, grinning behind raised palms.\n\"Just making sure we do it right.\" He left the engineer with his\nhead bobbing rhythmically through little smoke clouds. It was\nlittle triumphs like this that excited Peter, doing things people\nsaid couldn't be done. The engineers were the only people in the\ncompany for whom Peter felt any admiration and respect. And,\nsecretly, awe. They were the conveyers of his visions, the ones\nwho possessed the power to turn his radical ideas into real\nproducts.\n\nHe swung through the software testing lab. Several test\nengineers, each seated before a prototype Joey Plus, were running\nsystem software programs through their paces. The inhabitants\nwere oblivious to his presence as screens rolled and flashed,\nstyluses scribbled and tapped, speakers chirped, and printers\nprinted.\n\nSatisfied that all was rolling according to plan, Peter exited\nthe building and climbed into his BMW coupe. His natural\nappreciation for simple and beautifully designed products had\nprompted his decision to make BMW the company car for senior\nexecutives. When Matthew had gone out and ordered the exact same\nstyle and color coupe for himself, Peter was flattered. Until\ntheir friendship curdled. Now he'd begun to wonder if Matthew had\nonly chosen the car because he was trying to prove to the\nexecutive staff that he and Peter were in some way equal.\n\nAs he drove down Clyde Avenue he passed the many single-story\nstucco buildings that comprised Wallaby's international\nheadquarters. Eventually he passed the larger and more\ncorporate-looking three-story sales and marketing building, where\nMatthew and the other senior executives resided.\n\nPeter preferred to have his office among his engineers rather\nthan on the third floor of the larger corporate building. Though\nhis title was chairman, his job was to create Wallaby's\ncomputers, and to do that, he wanted to be right in the trenches\nwith his team. Especially lately. The last thing he wanted was to\nhave to sit near Matthew Locke. If he had been any closer, he\nmight have taken pity on the man he'd hired, and not gone through\nwith his new plan to remove him from the company.\n\nLeaving the complex, he headed for Highway 280. Waiting for the\ntraffic signal to change, he looked in his rear-view mirror at\nthe main corporate building with its Wallaby banner. The Wallaby\nlogo featured a sketched pocket with a baby kangaroo, a joey,\npoking its head out.\n\nHe felt a small gush of pride whenever he looked at the company\nlogo, at the thought of how many pockets he had filled with\nriches, in how many lives. And though tomorrow he would have to\nessentially sew shut one of those pockets, he was already\nbeginning to feel the sense of relief that would come very soon,\nwhen he regained complete control of the company he had built.\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\nShe stood and admired the bowl from different angles, marveling\nat how the spotlight shining down on it created rainbow effects\nand prismatic distortions. She had displayed the object on a\nsimple, waist-high pedestal finished in black lacquer. Maybe I\nshould not have rewarded myself so soon, thought Greta, since the\nboard meeting that would take care of Peter Jones was not until\ntomorrow. What if something went wrong?\n\nOf course, nothing would go wrong. She knew that Matthew had no\nchoice but to pitch Peter from his position at Wallaby, and not\nonly because she couldn't stand the precocious young founder. She\nsmirked when she thought about the blow Peter would feel after\nthe ax dropped at tomorrow's meeting.\n\nThe minute Greta had met him, she knew she was not going to like\nPeter Jones. He had taken to Matthew instantly, tugging on his\narm like a child when he was excited about something, or when\nMatthew's observations and comments would harmonize with Peter's\nown thoughts. He would listen intently when Matthew talked about\nbusiness and buying psychology, things she did not understand and\nhad no desire to know more about. But what she loathed most about\nPeter, which led to her involvement in his destiny, was that he\nmanaged to spend more time with Matthew than she did. Matthew\nwould practically ignore her in Peter's presence, so exhilarated\nwas he by the young man's company. When Matthew arrived home from\nwork, especially in the beginning, it was always \"Peter said\nthis,\" or \"Peter did that,\" so full of marvel was her husband at\nyoung headache's braininess. And every Saturday, like clockwork,\nPeter would be at the door before she was out of bed, asking\nMatthew to come out and play. One morning, while Peter was\nwaiting within earshot in the entrance hall, she loudly protested\nfrom their bedroom upstairs that she and Matthew never got to\nspend time together on Saturdays, as they used to when they lived\nin Connecticut. Afterward, Peter stopped coming to the door and\ntook to waiting outside the gate, like a mongrel. Not a bad\ndescription, she thought to herself. Greta had once read an\narticle about Peter that told of his life as an orphan. Obviously\nhe saw Matthew as a father figure. Well, too bad.\n\nGreta understood early on that Peter's attachment to Matthew\ncould ruin everything her husband had so carefully planned before\nhe accepted the job at Wallaby. Time was wasting, she observed;\nshe knew that the stronger Matthew and Peter's friendship became,\nthe farther Matthew would stray from the original plan. She had\nhad to act swiftly, otherwise Matthew might have had a change of\nheart altogether.\n\nTo start the ball rolling, Greta had told Matthew that she did\nnot want Peter in their home. How Matthew was to accomplish this\nwithout offending Peter was his problem; if he really cared about\nher, he'd spare her the company of the bratty wunderkind. She\nfollowed through by feigning anguish whenever Matthew mentioned\nPeter, and by pressuring him to get on with business: When would\nhe tell Peter about the development strategy? Why was he\nstalling? She knew that once Matthew revealed his strategy, the\nyoung man would withdraw from her husband. And perhaps that was\nwhy he had taken his time - he was enjoying too much their\nfriendship. Matthew's transformation plans were hideously\ncontrary to Peter's renegade spirit. It had been painful to hound\nMatthew constantly, but she had no choice. He would never have\ndealt with Peter and put his plan back on track if she had not\nintervened. A few weeks was all it had taken to re-focus Matthew.\nWhen he explained to Peter his hopes for the company - a profound\nstrategy for leading Wallaby into Big Business - the two men had\ntheir first falling-out, which seriously upset their formerly\nflawless courtship. Matthew had persisted in attempting to sway\nthe young founder into understanding his strategy, but each time\nhe faced argument and resistance. Greta had forced Matthew to\nconfess that as long as Peter was in control, the secret plan\nwould never materialize. Finally, Peter expressed doubt in\nMatthew's overall vision and qualifications, saying he was\npersonally hurt that Matthew could even hypothesize such a thing\nfor Wallaby. That said, Matthew halted his friendship with Peter,\nand drew heavily from his wife's support to rebuild his\nconfidence in the secret plan.\n\nShe felt wanted again. However, her expectation of spending more\ntime with Matthew was unfulfilled. Instead of spending weekends\nwith her, he spent more time than ever in his little home office,\nnext to the library. And when he wasn't holed up in there, he was\nconstantly reading about big computers and the latest\ntechnologies, his face often closer to the pages of a book than\nto his wife's face when they were in bed.\n\nAfter tomorrow, after Peter was truly invalidated, she knew that\nMatthew would start spending more time with her. She had to\nbelieve that. After all, it was she he had to thank for\nrectifying his temporary shortsightedness. At least that was how\nshe saw things.\n\nRaising a glass of wine to her lips, she heard the automatic\ngarage door open. He was home. She twisted the knob of the\nrecessed ceiling-mounted quartz lamp to full intensity. The\nsalmon bowl sparkled.\n\nHe appeared at the living room entrance, hands at his sides. She\npretended not to notice his arrival.\n\n\"Greta.\"\n\n\"Oh, darling,\" Greta said, pretending to be surprised.\n\nWithout remark, she quickly took in his tired expression. His\neyes seemed half closed, as if the reflection thrown off by the\nglittering object were blinding. Studying him, she searched for\nthe foundation of the man she had married, the man with the\nstrong and sinewy build, the confident posture, the sharp\naristocratic features. Today his cheeks appeared blanched, his\nstance tentative. With her glass of wine in hand, she strolled\ncasually across the room.\n\n\"What's that?\" Matthew said.\n\nShe pecked his impassive lips. \"That,\" she said, toasting the\nbowl with her glass, \"is pure brilliance.\"\n\n\"How much brilliance?\"\n\n\"A steal, Darling. I got it to celebrate your success. Let me get\nyou something to drink.\" She left him alone with \"his\" present.\n\nHe inspected her newest purchase. He had to admit, it was\nmagnificent, and as he scrutinized it more closely, he began to\nforget about his labored day and the impending showdown. He\nstudied one of the etched salmon that circled the bowl's rim. It\nswam against a powerful, unseen force, compelled onward with\ninner strength, driven by instinct to fulfill its obligation. It\nwas that way in business, he reflected, one had to be driven by\ninstinct and a sense of obligation, plain and simple -\n\nBut that word, simple, was like a hook that snagged his mind and\nreeled him from the peaceful waters that were his thoughts. Once\nmore, his thoughts returned to the damnable Peter Jones, his\nexcited voice raiding Matthew's mind like an unwelcome visitor.\n\n\"'If you get simple beauty and naught else, you get the best\nthing God invents,'\" Peter would wistfully recite, the poet\nRobert Browning's words, during design meetings. Forever\ndistrusting complexity, Peter made it his utmost priority that\nWallaby's products were unaffected in their design and easy to\nuse.\n\nOnce more, apprehension washed over Matthew like a shifting tide.\nIf only he could convince himself that everything would go\nexactly according to plan. It would, wouldn't it? He felt as\nthough his life depended on it. He just didn't feel one-hundred\npercent sure.\n\n\"Here,\" Greta said, handing him a small bottle of Perrier. Taking\nthe drink, he avoided looking at her bare hand...or at the other,\nwhich was concealed inside a silky white glove. He took a sudden\nand uncomfortable interest in the tiny bubbles that formed and\nrose in the bottle.\n\nGreta sat on the flowery chintz settee and patted the cushion\nnext to her. \"Come.\"\n\nBefore joining her, Matthew twisted off the bright lamp.\nNighttime descended on the salmon, their struggle temporarily\nsuspended. He sank into the softness of the sofa and rested his\neyes.\n\n\"Well? Is everything all set?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Good, Matthew,\" she said. \"I can't wait for you to be able to\nrelax once this all settles down.\" She thought of the time she\nwould have with him after tomorrow's meeting and smiled, more at\nthis thought than to comfort him.\n\nMatthew frowned. \"He says I don't know what I'm doing. That I\ndon't have a clue.\" He stared into the bottle. \"He says I don't\nhave instinct. No vision, guts. Unless I'm wrong, I don't think\nhe realizes what's going down tomorrow.\" He met his wife's eyes.\nHis expression soured; then half resentfully, he sought her\nreassurance. \"Have I been wrong? What if I've misread everyone's\nloyalties? What if he has his own plan to spring on me tomorrow?\"\n\nA voice inside Greta's head roared No! No matter what Peter Jones\nhad up his sleeve - yes, certainly he had something - her\nhusband's well thought out plan was more powerful. It was too\nlate now, anyway, to start worrying about the enemy's strategy.\nThat she never seriously considered it probably meant that her\ninstincts about Peter were correct. He was blind to what was\ncoming.\n\n\"No sweetheart. Don't think that way.\" She gently pushed back\nsome hair from Matthew's forehead. \"You're doing exactly the\nright thing. And after tomorrow, everything will be fine.\"\n\nHe offered her a dim smile, then closed his eyes.\n\nFor the briefest instant there she had felt his need for her. It\nhad been so long since he'd called to her for help. However\ncursory, she had served him nevertheless. And now it was her\nturn, tit for tat. \"Let's go for a walk down by the stables. What\ndo you say?\" She grasped his hand as she rose.\n\nToo weary to protest, he rose to his feet and let his wife lead\nhim off.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nWalking into his home, Peter heard Ivy playing the grand piano in\nthe drawing room. She was singing softly, a verse he did not\nrecognize. One of her own? The pleasing sounds bellowed and\nechoed through the more or less empty mansion. She did not hear\nhim enter the room.\n\nHer fingers settled on the last chords of the score. Peter\nsmelled the sweet fragrance of her long white-blond hair,\nbrightened and warmed by the sunlight streaming in through the\nFrench windows behind her. Coming closer, his shadow gave him\naway and she turned her head to greet him.\n\n\"Hello,\" she said, through the last fading chords of her music.\n\n\"That was wonderful. It's as if this entire house is joyful and\nalive when you're playing.\" He casually rested a hand on her\nshoulders, a simple expression of admiration.\n\nShe turned her cheek to his hand, and he went to move it, but\nbefore he was able to she stood and stretched. He took her seat\nthen, resting his hands on his lap. Looking past her and through\nthe windows, toward the hills that rolled beyond his estate, he\ncould see Hoover Tower in the distance, rising high above the\ntreetops of the Stanford University campus. Three weeks earlier\nhe had been there to give the commencement speech to the\ngraduating class. Afterward, at the reception, a striking young\ngirl had introduced herself. Her name was Ivy, she said, and she\nproceeded to tell him about the speech and language interface\nthat she was developing for the Wallaby Joey computer. When it\nwas finished, she promised, the interface would allow people to\ninteract with the Joey by speaking to it, and it would reply in\nkind, in its own \"voice.\" The Joey's intuitive and portable\ndesign, she told him, was what had inspired her to develop the\nspeech recognition and simulation interface software. When he\nasked what were her eventual ambitions for the project, she said\nshe wasn't sure. She had no agenda for the summer and, for lack\nof a more tempting course, had halfheartedly committed herself to\ntraveling across the country with some friends. He was intrigued\nby her knowledge of linguistics, particularly when she revealed\nthat she had never used a computer until the Joey. That part was\nespecially touching, and he somehow felt compelled to help her,\nso he offered her the opportunity to continue developing the Joey\nspeech and language component in his home. The next day she\narrived with her duffel bag, a couple of books, a few boxes of\nfloppy disks, and a backpack. Peter often had guests straying in\nand out of his home, usually students to whom he offered the use\nof his thoroughly equipped computer lab. In return he asked that\nthey respect the privilege by picking up after themselves. He let\nthem come and go for as long as they liked, and his doors were\nnever locked. Alice, his maid and cook, always kept herself\nabreast of the various artists in residence.\n\nShe appeared now in the doorway, wiping her hands on her apron.\nShe was a small, voluminous Spanish woman with pulled-back black\nhair and a gorgeous smile. \"Hello, Mr. Petey,\" she said with\nplain affection. She turned to the young girl. \"I finished\npreparing your meat and spices.\" Peter looked at Alice for an\nexplanation, and she nodded to Ivy.\n\n\"I'm making you a special Mediterranean dish tonight,\" Ivy said,\ntaking Peter's hands in hers. \"My way of saying thanks, for being\nso kind and letting me stay here with you.\"\n\n \"Great,\" he said, and casually withdrew his hands.\n\nUsually it started out, as it had a number of times before, as a\nrent-free working environment. Peter received both pleasure and\nsatisfaction from being around artists and other creative types\nwho crafted amazing things from the technology he had invented.\nExcept for his work and Kate, when she was in town, his life was\nsurprisingly spare. Having the students in his home filled the\nspacious mansion with the lives and passionate works of others.\nAnd with little effort, he was helpful to them. In several cases\nthe projects they worked on became marketable products, and\nsometimes he nurtured them in getting started as software or\nhardware developers by introducing them to the appropriate\nmanagers at Wallaby. But to some of the students, staying at\nPeter's became more than just a neat place to crash. Once a\ncouple of young men had taken off with some of the equipment and\na few of Peter's personal valuables. And then there were the\ngirls, who often presented their own set of problems. And right\nnow, Ivy was the mansion's sole no-strings boarder.\n\n\"Come on,\" Ivy said, taking him by the hand once again. \"I want\nto show you what I've been working on this afternoon.\"\n\nAs they passed, Alice busied herself with a tissue in her apron\npocket. Peter noted the uncertain look on her face; she was all\ntoo familiar with the course that Ivy's stay was taking.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nDressed in a violet silk camisole, Greta Locke sat on the edge of\ntheir large bed and brushed down her thick chestnut curls. As she\ndid this she observed herself - her hair, her face, but never the\nmovement of her hands - in the mirror above her bureau. Though it\nwas early, she had nonchalantly followed Matthew upstairs to the\nbedroom when, after dinner, he had said he was going turning in\nearly. She had a modest face that she considered robust rather\nthan pretty. It was satisfactorily oval in shape, though a little\ntoo fleshy in the cheeks. Her nose was sized accordingly, yet if\nit had been a little longer, straighter, perhaps she would have\nbeen a real model - but then again, her face had never been her\nselling point...\n\nWhile she scrutinized her complexion, her right hand, as if\nguided by its own vision, encountered the crystal lotion\ndispenser resting on her bureau. With a light press she dispersed\ntwo long, corpulent worms of Lancome lotion into her hand.\nWorking one hand over the other with systematic precision, she\nperformed the evening ritual without ever once looking at them.\nOn this occasion she focused her vision, through the mirror, on\nthe lighted bathroom doorway at the opposite end of the bedroom\nsuite. Finishing up, working again on the familiar motions\nwithout directly needing to - without wanting to - watch what she\nwas doing, she reached into a drawer and retrieved a pair of\nfine, exclusively tailored white silk gloves. Just as she was\npulling on the second glove the bathroom light snapped off.\n\nMatthew appeared, wearing light blue Oxford cloth pajamas made of\nthe same material used to tailor his business shirts. That was\nher husband, she thought with a tinge of malice, all business\nboth in and out of bed.\n\nGreta snapped off the lighted mirror and climbed beneath the cool\nsheets, folded the layers of bedclothes to just below her\nbreasts. Matthew settled on top of the sheets, sealing her in on\none side, and clamped his hands together behind his head.\nStraining her peripheral vision, she saw that he was staring at\nthe ceiling.\n\nShe turned on her pillow to face him. \"Darling, don't keep\nthinking about tomorrow.\" Softly: \"Try to relax.\"\n\nTaking her advice, she watched as the puzzled, problem-solving\nfrown on his face slackened and was replaced by a vague yet\nunwavering gaze.\n\nShe stretched across him to turn off the antique bedside lamp,\nher breasts barely an inch from his chin. As she drew back, she\ngently settled herself on his chest.\n\nThrough the windows beside the bed, the valley shone brightly.\nOrange and yellow pinpoints of light, far in the distance, glowed\nand shimmered in the cool summer night. She felt a sudden urgent\ndesire to get out of bed and close the curtains, shutting out the\nview of the damned valley.\n\nWas she rushing things? First the bowl, and now making love. But\nit had been so, so long, she thought, in her silent agony.\nMatthew had simply shut off where activity between them was\nconcerned, telling her once, several months ago, that he could\nnot concentrate on lovemaking, not even their particular style of\nit, until things were working again and his plan was firmly on\ntrack. Still, they were so close, just hours away from tomorrow's\nbig event and the unquestionably victorious outcome that was\nrightfully theirs.\n\nJust a kiss. Was that asking too much?\n\nShe gently nuzzled his neck and throat, which showed minimally\nthrough the pajama top, tracing her long and delicately gloved\nhand, the part of her body to which he had once been most\nattracted, most submissive, along his upper body.\n\nHe sighed through his nostrils and closed his eyes.\n\nWas he responding? Perhaps he too felt that he deserved to reward\nhimself a day early, she thought with a private cheer. She\ninhaled deeply and pressed his shoulder with her left hand,\ncareful to keep the sight of it from his peripheral vision. Her\nother hand strayed along his biceps. Raising her face, she closed\nher eyes and moved her lips to his.\n\nHe sniffed, and she opened her eyes just in time to see him turn\nhis agonized face toward the window. He sneezed, twice, and she\nflinched with each burst, but was at the same time enormously\nrelieved too. For an instant she had had the impression that the\nface he'd made had been in response to her. But it was only a\nsneeze. Two sneezes. Nothing at all to do with her, and so silly\nfor her to have thought otherwise.\n\nOr was it. There he was, gazing out the window again, as if he\nwere counting the individual lights in the valley. She scolded\nherself for not having pulled the shade.\n\n\"Matthew,\" she said softly, meaning to apologize or assure him or\n-\n\n\"Good night,\" he said.\n\nOr nothing.\n\nIt was useless, and so she retreated to her side of the bed and\nlay there in silent deliberation. For the second time today she\nworried if perhaps the crystal bowl she had purchased had been a\nmistake, her private celebration somehow jinxing the outcome of\ntomorrow's meeting.\n\nThey lay there like that for a long time, silent and awake but\ninexpressive, until, eventually, exhaustion won out and they both\nslept, each playing their parts in a dream that did not embody\nthe other.\n\n\n* * *\n\nPeter sat on a stool at the island console range while Ivy\nprepared her special dinner. She bustled about in what seemed\nlike a frenzy, but he understood, with some amusement, that she\nhad the meal under complete control. A fragrant lamb and\nvegetable stew bubbled lazily in a large pot on the stove. In the\noven, two small pizzas baked. Peter had enjoyed watching Ivy roll\nout the dough with her hands and shape it into little rounds. On\neach she had arranged caramelized onions, chopped olives, pine\nnuts, grated Parmesan cheese. During the preparation, she\nconcentrated intensely on each step. A number of times she held\nthe recipe close to her face and read a line or two aloud. At the\nsame time she managed to engage him in interesting conversation.\nThough she had been a guest in his house for three weeks now,\nthis was the first opportunity he'd had to spend time with her.\nAnd considering his day at Wallaby, her company tonight was a\nwelcome relief.\n\n\"Pass me that cayenne, would you,\" she said, reaching out with\none hand.\n\n\"Which is it?\"\n\n\"That's curry. The one next to it. Right.\"\n\nThe rosiness of her face, from all of the bustling about, against\nher white-blond hair, gave the effect that she had spent the day\nat the beach. She wore tattered old jeans cinched at the waist\nwith a colorful bandanna, and a white dress shirt with no bra\nbeneath. He realized suddenly that he was staring. He spoke.\n\n\"So do you cook often?\"\n\nShe gave him an amused look. \"You kidding. For who. I've been in\na dorm, chowin' on junk food and studying for the last three\nyears.\"\n\n\"Then how'd you learn all this stuff?\"\n\n\"Easy. All you have to do is follow the directions. Besides, I'm\na quick study.\" She met his eyes and held his stare, as if\nchallenging him. Until a bell chimed. \"Pizzas,\" she said with a\ndelighted smile, breaking their link, which had felt to him a\nlittle weird but not exactly unpleasant. Just,\nwell...significant. Careful, he warned himself.\n\nHe watched her slip on an oven mitt and told himself he should\nreally look away as she bent over to retrieve the appetizer. Her\nbreasts, he could see, were not large, yet were ample enough to\nillustrate gravity. They reminded him of the firm doughy rounds\nshe had worked beneath her fingers minutes ago. As she reached\ninside the oven a little burst of heated air gently raised a few\nstray wisps of her hair, and an instant later the delectable\naroma of her creation wafted his way. He swallowed.\n\nThen something about her startled him and he felt his throat\nabruptly tighten.\n\nAs she was rising, holding the tray in one hand, she swept her\nhair aside with the other, and he had the opportunity to see,\njust for an instant, inside the collar of her shirt, in back of\nher neck.\n\nWhat he saw was his own name - the code name the dry cleaner used\nto label his shirts. Something that felt about the size of a\nmarble felt as though it had suddenly become lodged in his chest.\nA little to the left. Yes, there. In his heart.\n\n\"What?\" she said, freezing in place.\n\n\"Oh,\" was all he could manage at first. He gave a little laugh.\n\"Nothing, oh nothing. Sorry. I just zoned out there for a\nsecond.\" His lungs moved, he was breathing again.\n\n\"Hmm,\" she said, a moment's scrutiny, then she shrugged and\ntransferred the miniature pizzas to the butcher block counter.\n\"Where's the cutter thing?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry?\" he said. He had blanked her out for a moment, and\nwas just beginning to recover from his jolt. The cutter thing. He\nwanted to be helpful, to tell her where to find it.\n\nUntil he found more: The jeans, with their familiar rips where\nhis own knees had eventually worn through the denim. She was\nwearing his pants, too. The marble thing became a fist.\n\n\"You know,\" she said, making a rolling gesture with her hand,\n\"The pizza cutter thing.\"\n\n\"No. I mean, I don't know. In one of those drawers, probably.\"\nHad she gone through his closet? Had she helped herself to\nanything else?\n\n\"Ah. Here we go.\" She returned with the instrument and cut the\npizza into quarters.\n\nHer feet were bare. She wore no jewelry, no watch. He fabricated\na possible explanation: She was doing her laundry and had asked\nAlice if she could borrow some of his old clothes while hers went\naround.\n\n\"Mmm. Not bad. Here. Eat.\"\n\nIt was probably nothing, he told himself. He was probably\noverreacting. He'd ask her about it later, no big deal. Still, it\nhad given him one hell of a little scare there. Enough, already.\nRight now, he was hungry.\n\n\"Delicious,\" he said truthfully. \"I can't believe you don't do\nthis all the time.\"\n\n\"I could,\" she said, and stopped chewing. He caught her look,\nedged with some unknown meaning. \"I mean,\" she went on, waving at\nthe pot on the stove, \"I could eat like this all the time, but\nwho has the time, right?\"\n\nPeter just nodded. He took another bite of pizza. He was thirsty.\n\n\"Wine. That's what we need.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"White? Is that good for what you're making?\"\n\n\"Red's better.\"\n\nHe went to the tall narrow wine rack hidden inside a cabinet. His\nfingertips lingered on the neck of a particular reserve, a\nspecial bottle. He deliberated for a moment, then selected a\nyounger vintage. He opened it and poured them each a glass,\nhanded one to her. There was an awkward moment, in which both\nstood motionless. He didn't know what to say and, gratefully, she\nmade it easy for him.\n\n\"To new friends.\"\n\n\"New friends,\" he said, slipping in a small emphasis on the\nlatter.\n\nThey touched their glasses together and Peter looked into his own\nto avoid her eyes as he sipped the wine.\n\n\"Come on,\" Ivy said, \"let's eat.\" She went about filling two\nbowls with stew, while he sliced the crusty loaf of bread she'd\nset out on the counter. She carried the bowls into the dining\nroom, and he followed with the bread and his glass of wine.\n\n\"Sit,\" she said, \"I'll get the bottle.\"\n\nHe drank some more, and when she came back in he noticed her\nglass. She had filled it.\n\nThey ate in silence for a few moments. He told her the stew was\ndelicious, and she said she was surprised, though she wasn't\nreally.\n\n\"So, what made you choose Stanford?\" he said.\n\n\"A course they had. It's called VTSS. Values, Technology,\nScience, and Society.\"\n\n\"I've never heard of it.\"\n\n\"It's been around for awhile. Interesting mix.\"\n\n\"Sounds like it. What interests you about it most?\"\n\n\"Well, how they all overlap. One affecting and impacting the\nother, and so on. You sure know all about that.\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"Sure, you.\" She snorted. \"Come on. You know, the way the\ncomputers you invented have changed our society, that they're\nfounded on science and technology. How they've affected people's\nvalues.\" She glanced up from her plate. \"I mean, really, you've\ndemocratized computing power among the masses, putting it in the\nhands of the people. Giving them a choice, an alternative to\nbusiness as usual. No more Big Brother, brother.\" She resumed\neating. \"Anyway, that's what the course was about.\" She spoke\nwith the easy, unaffected confidence one acquires with\nexperience. Yet she was only twenty-one.\n\nHe realized that his spoon was halfway between his bowl and\nmouth. He did not know how long he'd been sitting there like\nthat. He set it down and poured himself more wine. He looked at\nher over the rim of his glass, and felt as if he were seeing her\nfor the first time. It was an agreeable feeling, and that in turn\nmade it an adverse feeling. Thin ice ahead, if he didn't watch\nhimself. Friends, he repeated to himself, and don't forget it.\n\n\"Did you hear me?\"\n\nHad she said something? \"I'm sorry - you were saying?\"\n\n\"I said, that's what the course was about. I dropped it.\"\n\n\"But you sound like an expert. Why the change of heart?\"\n\n\"Nah. Music. This speech stuff. That's what I told you when I met\nyou, don't you remember?\"\n\nIn fact, he did not remember. What's more, he realized, was that\nhe didn't know her last name either. Before he was aware of what\nhe was doing, he asked her, \"What's your last name?\"\n\nShe was pouring herself more wine. She stopped. Was she hurt?\n\nShe grinned. \"You got me.\"\n\nHis expression betrayed his confusion.\n\n\"I never told you my last name!\" she said, as if that explained\neverything. Whatever everything was. \"I see what you're getting\nat: How could I ask if you remember that I dropped that course to\nget into this linguistics programming stuff when you don't even\nknow my last name. It's because I never told you.\"\n\nHe went to take another sip of wine, but then decided to hold off\nfor a bit.\n\n\"It's Green. Ivy Green. Can you stand it?\"\n\n\"It's certainly very Earth conscious.\"\n\n\"Very funny. The only green I think Rick and Jeannette had in\nmind when they named me was reefer.\"\n\nHe burst out laughing. \"How come?\"\n\n\"Oh, please. Don't you get it? I'm a Sixties baby, like, 'Make\nLove, Not War,' 'Give Peace a Chance,' 'If It Feels Good, Do It.'\nWell, they did it. They met at Woodstock, no kidding, and, a few\nyears later, they did it, made me, and got married and all. How\nit felt, I mean, good or not, I never asked. Quit laughing. They\nmoved to California, lived right at the corner of Haight and\nAshbury, and found peace and all that. Later, when my dad\naccidentally started his own herbal tea company - yes, it's the\nbrand you've got on the shelf there in the kitchen - they moved\nto Mill Valley. That's where I grew up, with parents who told me\nto call them by their first names, so we'd get closer to where we\nvisualized ourselves in the universe. Or some shit like that.\"\n\n\"Sorry, I'm not laughing at the circumstances. It's the way you\ntell it.\"\n\n\"No problem. I'm still amused by the Rick and Jeannette Show.\"\nFrom out of nowhere came a pout. Then: \"But I'm not goin' to live\nmy life like they did.\" She sniffed deeply. \"Um, I'll be right\nback.\"\n\nHad he offended her? He'd meant no harm in laughing. He was just\namused by her deadpan delivery. While she excused herself, Peter\ngot up from the table. Her talk about the Sixties had aroused\nsome vague sentiment in him. Whatever. All of the sudden the\nplace seemed too quiet. While she was away from the table he got\nup and loaded a compact disc into his stereo system. The first\ntrack was a folksy acoustic number.\n\nIvy returned to the table smiling. \"Want more stew?\"\n\n\"I'm stuffed,\" Peter said.\n\nShe sat down.\n\n\"Here.\" He poured more wine into her glass, trying for an apology\nif it was in fact called for. He had no idea.\n\nThe instrumental ended, then a lovely female voice filled the\nroom with song. It was his absolute favorite. His eyelids lowered\nslowly, automatically, and a smile washed across his face. The\nartist's sensual voice had an effect on him that was like easing\ninto a warm bath. He sat there like that for a little bit,\nforgetting Ivy and his dinner and everything else.\n\nIvy turned her head to the source of his evident pleasure. Her\nfrown went unnoticed.\n\nPeter had met the vocalist one afternoon at a Sierra Club\nluncheon thrown in his honor after Wallaby had donated several\ncomputers to the noted environmental organization. Kate\nMcGreggor, the \"softly outspoken\" folk-rock star, was the keynote\nspeaker. He tried to be attentive to her words during her speech,\nbut he constantly found himself drifting, starting at her warm\ngreen eyes, sighing when she casually brushed aside her hair,\ndark brown with sunned highlights and occasional strands of gray.\nIn just fifteen minutes Kate had made an impression on him like\nno other woman ever had. Meanings for her wandered into his mind.\nIntelligent. Simple. Pure. True. What you see is what you get, he\nsurmised. After the meal, she sang. Her voice was enchanting,\nperfect, and as she sang about pain and hope and love he knew\nthat he had to get to know her personally. Immediately after her\nperformance he introduced himself. At first she seemed\ndisinterested. He suspected her judgment was influenced by his\ninvolvement in an industry notorious for destroying the\nenvironment. And perhaps also by the eight years difference in\ntheir ages. He invited her to visit Wallaby for a personal tour.\nShe hesitated, but ultimately he persuaded her to accept after\nasking for a chance to prove that he and Wallaby were unlike all\nthe rest. When she arrived a week later, she surprised him with a\nspecial gift: A bottle of wine from her parents' obscure little\nvineyard in Oregon, where she had grown up. It was a Cabernet\nSauvignon, bottled the same year he had founded Wallaby. He was\ntouched by the thoughtfulness of her gesture, and told her she\nhad to be the one to share it with him when the company was ten\nyears old. Her tour was scheduled to last two hours, but as Peter\nexpressed his own thoughts and concerns about the environment,\nthe state of education, the future, they engaged in long and\nsatisfying conversation, and by the end of the day their\nattraction for one another was evident. And had remained so to\nthis day. They were two people comfortable with themselves and\nwith each other. She maintained a home in Los Angeles, where she\nwas constantly at work on her music or lending her celebrity\nstatus to political causes about which she felt strongly. She\ncame to stay with Peter between recordings and projects, and her\nindependence meshed perfectly with his own like composure,\ncreating the foundation for what had become a lasting and loving\nrelationship. They had been together for nearly eight years, and\nthe distance between them imposed by their careers generated a\nconstant longing that kept their affection for one another fresh\nand alive. Sometimes, like now, it was difficult and he wished\nthey could be together more often. Especially now, with\neverything the way it was at Wallaby...\n\nAnd with that thought, he opened his eyes and came back around to\nthe present, and to his guest.\n\nIvy was lowering a coffee cup from her lips, staring at him. Had\nshe made a pot? He hadn't even heard her in the kitchen. In front\nof him sat a steaming cup of coffee. Perfect, he thought. That\nodd sense of dread he'd experienced earlier had returned, just\nfor an instant, when he'd opened his eyes. He needed to sober up\na little.\n\nAbruptly she spoke.\n\n\"Is it true?\"\n\n\"What's that?\" he asked. He met her azure eyes with a perplexed\nsmile. She gestured with a nod to where the music was coming\nfrom. \"That you two are lovers?\"\n\n\"Completely.\"\n\nShe nodded, added more coffee to her cup, very slowly, with\nconsiderable concentration. She emptied half a packet of Equal\ninto her coffee. Addressing her immersed spoon, she said, \"In\neverything I read, like \"People,\" or that story about you in last\nmonth's \"Esquire,\" they say you'll probably get married. To her.\"\n\n\"I don't know, it's hard to say\" Peter said, knowing the right\nthing to do would be to agree with the speculation, but choosing\nto answer truthfully instead. \"We're both very busy. She's always\nrecording or involved in some cause or another. And I'm at\nWallaby.\" The feeling of dread inside his heart rolled on its\nside. However this time, instead of striking quickly and fading\naway, its presence seemed to stretch out and linger as he sat\nwatching what Ivy was doing with her half-empty packet of Equal.\n\nShe had dumped the remainder of the artificial sweetener onto the\nblack enamel table. Using the straight edge of the little blue\npacket, she cut several fine, stark, parallel lines from the\nsmall white pile of grains.\n\nNot very subtle, and not a good sign. He attempted to resume the\nconversation.\n\n\"Anyway, as far as marriage, we've never really discussed it\nseriously.\"\n\nAll of the sudden, he understood the feeling assaulting his\nsenses. Trepidation.\n\nSomething - no, a number of things - were going to happen. It was\nas though a crystal ball had bloomed in his mind's eye, giving\nhim a quick peek into the near future. It all came in a blurry\nrush, no single picture or image freezing long enough to grasp\ncompletely. But he caught the gist, just same. He would go\nthrough all the required motions, but in the back of his mind he\nknew he was helpless. What was coming, he realized with a\nthrobbing certainty amplified by the wine, was only natural.\nJesus, how sick that sounded to his private ear. Still, he\nwouldn't give in without a fight, for that, too, was only\nnatural. Quietly he stared at the lines she'd cut, mesmerized by\ntheir orderliness.\n\nIvy, too, studied the straightness of her lines, her upper lip\nhidden beneath the lower. She was the first to notice the\nsilence, to sense its uneasy drift. With a great gust, she blew\nthe white lines from the table and looked across the table at him\nwith a renewed smile.\n\n\"Oh, hey. Sorry. I had a little skip down unhappy-memory-lane\nthere for a second, is all. I hope I didn't upset you.\"\n\nPeter looked at her. He shook his head, then rose without a word\nand carried his coffee cup into the kitchen.\n\n\"Hey, you want to open more wine?\" Ivy was at his side, carrying\ntheir empty glasses. \"I've been here only three weeks and already\nhave a prototype of my speech interface working.\" The trembling\nof her hand caused the glasses to steadily clink together, a\nfragile ringing sound. She didn't seem to notice. \"Come on, let's\ncelebrate.\"\n\nHe rested his hand over the glasses, silencing them. \"We've had\nenough.\"\n\nShe narrowed the already small space between them, and he slid\nhis hands into his pockets, not sure what to do with them. \"Thank\nyou for such a great meal,\" he said, and made an attempt to get\npast her.\n\nShe giggled, held her ground.\n\nHe let out a frustrated breath. \"Please,\" he said. \"I've got to\nget to bed.\" There was no humor in his face.\n\n\"All right, then,\" she said sullenly, and pressed her back\nagainst the doorjamb, making way for him.\n\nJust as he was about to shut off the stereo he changed his mind,\nand decided to leave it on. To keep Kate there with him, he\nthought, humming along with her voice on his way to his bedroom.\n\nHe lit a single candle and placed it on the floor beside his\nfuton bed. Except for the thick stuffed sleeping mat, some books\npiled against the wall, a Tizio lamp and the Zuni Indian\nsculpture of a bear that Kate had given him one birthday, his\nbedroom was bare, like the rest of the house.\n\nHe tossed his clothes onto the floor and sat in the lotus\nposition on the soft cotton mat. Kate had introduced him to the\nbasics of meditation when they had first started dating, teaching\nhim to lead himself into natural, peaceful sleep. He closed his\neyes and concentrated on relaxing the muscles in his neck and\nshoulders. Gradually he worked his way down, through the rest of\nhis body. His breathing slowed, and he imagined whiteness,\nweightlessness. The whiteness slashed into a black surface and he\nthought of Ivy and the dining room table, her playing with the\nlittle blue packet. He pushed this away and brought back the pure\nwhite. After a short period, the soft whispering snowstorm turned\nto warm earth tones, to Kate's lovely hair...\n\nThe sound of footsteps broke his concentration. He opened his\neyes.\n\nIvy stood before him, wearing a lightweight cotton kimono. Her\nface glowed warmly in the candlelight. Her voice was a mere\nwhisper. \"I want to be with you.\"\n\nPeter remained seated in the lotus position, unable, it seemed,\nto move. He became sharply aware of her delicate physique, his\nnakedness. He felt their vulnerable auras bending toward one\nanother, reaching. He thought about what he'd come to realize at\nthe dinner table, the feeling of dread inside him that seemed to\nsuddenly threaten everything in his life. He thought of telling\nher about the few close calls he had had over the past couple of\nyears, how they had ended in tears and shattered dreams for the\nstudents. He thought of telling her that in all their years\ntogether he had never been unfaithful to Kate. He thought of\ntelling her that in all their years together, Wallaby had never\nbeen unfaithful to him, and it was the same thing. Was, he wanted\nto say aloud and tell her, tell anyone who'd listen, why.\n\nBut he told her none of these things. Instead he said to himself,\nwithout uttering a word, I had a lot to drink, it was the wine.\nBut was he really that drunk, or was it something else? Something\nworse? That he even considered this excuse, that he was actually\nentertaining a defense for something that had not even happened,\nnot yet, presaged the guilt that would follow if he were to allow\nthem to come together. And apart. And it was all the same thing,\nhe told himself. Today, tomorrow, and the next day and every day\nafter that.\n\nHe considered her. She was an angel whose mission was to ease him\ninto the hereafter. He concluded, when he noticed a powdery white\nsubstance encircling the inner edge of her nostrils, that she was\nalready \"there,\" perhaps even farther, some point beyond\nrecognition. As if she interpreted this, she brushed her nose\nwith the back of her hand and sniffled.\n\n\"Peter,\" she pleaded, her voice husky, \"You've empowered me.\nYou've given me a whole new meaning. It's my future.\"\n\nSomehow her words had breaking effect on him. He was both\nrepulsed and beholden by her sentiment. By himself. He turned his\nface toward the window, fighting the urge to reach out and pull\nher down by the waist. It was not as if he were in love with this\nyoung girl. And the way she made it sound, he was acting on her\nbehalf, like she needed him. Not the other way around. No, not\nthat at all. He didn't need her. She was nothing to him. Just\nanother worshipper in a long string of subjects.\n\nAnd, as if to prove his cruel pretense, she knelt before him. Her\nsoft knees touched his shins. He smelled the peppery sweetness of\nher breath, and his eyes lingered on her radiant golden hair. He\nlooked into her shining, anticipating eyes.\n\nWith a deep, winded sigh that was almost a cry, he finally\nacknowledged his fear. It was inevitable, he told himself, as he\nfelt himself rising. He placed his fingertips about her neck,\ntraced his thumbs along her delicate lips, her precious ears,\ntouched her smooth eyelids, and gently pressed them shut. Her\nbreath hitched, and she waited for his touch to lead them\nfarther.\n\nHe slid the kimono from her lean body, and guided her hands to\nhis shoulders. He drew her down, guiding her to his hips. Her\nsmooth buttocks slid along his thighs. He felt her pause as she\nsettled onto him, over him.\n\nThey kissed.\n\nShe pulled away her lips and raised her hips.\n\nHe moved his mind to another place, into and around and between\nKate's lovely, far-off lyrics. He concentrated, tuned himself to\nher rhythm.\n\nDown, then up, then again, she slowly drove herself harder and\nharder. He matched her motion with equal urgency, little lunging\nlifts, telling himself at the same time that he was not\nparticipating, not really, that she was doing all of the work, it\nwas all her, not him. Their mouths worked desperately, lunging\nfor one another, each attempt to kiss more impossible, more\ndesired than the last...\n\nSpent, he felt a delirious sense of relief, as if it had all been\na bizarre dream from which he had just awakened. He raised his\nhead from the mat. For a brief, wanting moment he envisioned Kate\nresting lightly on top of him.\n\nThe music had ended, the silence was palpable.\n\nHis mind collapsed. He felt as if he had taken an enormous plunge\nbackward from a high altitude, his head dizzy, his thoughts vague\nas he fell. He squirmed beneath the full weight the young girl\nlying atop him, trying to escape from what they had done. He\nwanted tonight to be over. He wanted tomorrow to be over. He\nwanted both gone forever. He wanted another chance.\n\nIvy stirred. She raised her head off Peter's chest and looked at\nhim. Her face was glistening, content. \"Thank you,\" was all she\nsaid. She raised herself from him and collected her kimono. She\ncovered him lightly with the comforter, blew out the candle, and\nvanished.\n\nHe tested his defense. A whisper: \"It was the wine - \"\n\nBut he could not complete the sentence, for it was already done.\nAnd it was not the wine. It was another thing altogether. And he\nfelt it now.\n\nThe little thing in his heart. The little thing that had come and\ngone earlier in the evening. It was back again. It lay quietly,\nbarely perceptible, like the breathing of a tiny creature, and he\nhad almost not noticed it. But there was no mistaking it now, and\nhe fought to grasp hold of it, to suffocate it, but his attempts\nwere futile. It felt as though the thing had established\npermanent residency.\n\nFor many hours, until his consciousness finally succumbed to\nmental depletion, he was disturbed by a queer premonition. That\nthe dark, throbbing thing in his heart was determined to eat its\nway out, ever so slowly, boring straight through the only parts\nthat Peter had ever loved, the only parts that had ever mattered.\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n\nIt was a bright, hazy morning, not yet seven o'clock, but already\nhot and humid, which wasn't so unusual for a June day in New York\nCity. William Harrell braced himself for the cool comfort of the\nlimousine's air-conditioned interior.\n\nFor twenty-five minutes he would relax in a comfortable silent\nplushness. He stretched his legs, lengthening his taut body until\nhis feet touched the facing seatback. His calves responded\nwearily. Last evening's workout, the first in more than a week,\nhad taken its toll. He had skipped several sessions since putting\nin longer hours over the past couple of days, working on the\ncompany's portable computer strategy. The break in his routine,\nregardless of whatever aches and pains it caused, brought him the\nkind of excitement on which he thrived. His regal face had the\nprecisely aged features of a character actor cast in the role of\njudge, or the President of the United States. On occasion he wore\nglasses, when he remembered, for seeing things up close. At\nsixty-two, his looks suited his job perfectly.\n\nThe car briskly pulled away from the brownstone, his course and\ndestination the same today as it had been each business day for\nthe past fourteen years.\n\nHe eagerly unfolded the \"Wall Street Journal. In the News Brief\ncolumn analysts speculated as they did every quarter about\nchanges at Wallaby, Incorporated. According to the story, sources\nclose to the company suggested that the company's founder, Peter\nJones, and its president, Matthew Locke, were not getting along\nas famously as they once had. There was speculation that a major,\nlong-overdue reorganization would be announced in today's board\nmeeting. Matthew Locke's corporate organizational changes at\nInternational Foods were revisited. A Wallaby engineer who had\nasked to remain anonymous was quoted: \"Jones has created a\nrivalry between his division [Joey] and ours [Mate].\" The\ninformant went on, \"It's really strange. Jones invented the Mate,\nyet he says that anyone who is not associated with the Joey is a\nbozo.\" The article explained that separate product divisions were\nprecisely what Matthew Locke had earlier in his career put an end\nto at International Foods, when he had merged the food and\nbeverage divisions, as well as several other minor groups, into\none umbrella organization. A brief background story on the Joey\ndiscussed its sparse sales and the fact that few software\nprograms were available for use with the computer, underscoring\nthe analysts' predictions of a major overhaul. All of the experts\nagreed that the product was revolutionary and proclaimed that if\nWallaby could speed Joey applications to market, it could then\ngain major market share and thereby disarm the older, less flashy\ntechnology of its largest competitor, International Computer\nProducts. The consensus was that Wallaby had to get its act\ntogether if it was to have any hope of remaining at the forefront\nof portable computer technology innovation.\n\nWilliam Harrell smiled. That was exactly what he had hoped to\nread. He folded the newspaper and tossed it onto the seat beside\nhim.\n\nThe car neared its destination, turning for the final stretch\nonto a block with the largest buildings in the city.\n\nIf everything went as the analysts predicted, William Harrell\nwould soon begin implementing his new plan. The existing one, a\nconservative strategy that the company had followed for two\nyears, would soon be replaced with one informed by none of the\ncustomary Fortune 500 company protocol. William Harrell's plan\nwas based on a decision he had made two years ago, around the\nsame time the press had touted Wallaby's newly appointed\npresident, Matthew Locke, as \"ICP's Nemesis.\"\n\nThe car slowed in front of a massive building with a black marble\nfacade. William adjusted his tie and tugged at the jacket of his\ncharcoal pinstriped suit. As the driver opened his door the city\nair hit him like a furnace blast. Towering above him were\nseventy-six stories of world renowned corporate power, wholly\noccupied by the company whose name was carved in stone above the\nbuilding's entrance: INTERNATIONAL COMPUTER PRODUCTS.\n\nHe entered the building, rode the elevator to its highest level,\ngreeted his secretary, and entered his office, on whose door a\ngolden plaque announced: Chairman & Chief Executive Officer.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nEach member of the board and of the senior executive staff filed\ninto the Wallaby boardroom. Most of them arrived at eight o'clock\nsharp, avoiding the usual idle conversation that, in the past,\nhad always taken place outside the room.\n\nMatthew's secretary, Eileen, stood in the doorway of his office.\n\"It's time,\" she said, then returned to her desk.\n\nMatthew stood. He clipped his pen to the yellow tablet on which\nhe'd been writing.\n\nEileen busied herself at her desk, arranging papers and notes.\nShe paused and said, \"Matthew, good luck.\"\n\nHe gave her a small nod and headed for the boardroom.\n\nThe exotic fruits, croissants, pastries, coffee, and bottles of\nmineral water on the table set up outside the boardroom had\nhardly been touched. Normally the table would be nearly empty by\nnow, and the executive staff secretaries, disguising their\ncravings by pretending to go to the ladies' room, would pick over\nthe remains once the boardroom door had closed and the meeting\nwas underway. But today they could enjoy themselves in a\nleisurely fashion, for none of the board members seemed to have\nappetites.\n\nThe room fell from a fuzzy hum to heavy silence when Matthew\nentered. Immediately he saw that Peter had not yet arrived. He\nseated himself in one of two vacant leather chairs at either end\nof the long, black table. The room's amenities and furnishings\nwere simple and high-tech. Bleached wood paneling on one wall\nstood in stark contrast with the deep charcoal rug. On the wall\nopposite the windows, a series of segmented panels unfolded to\nreveal a massive rear-projection movie screen. At the other end,\naudiovisual equipment was stacked behind hinged, smoked-glass\ndoors. Here, encapsulated multimedia performances, new product\nvideos, employee interviews, research and development sneak\npreviews, and live TV spots or teleconferences were viewed with\nthe touch of a finger. Today, however, the equipment would remain\nsilent and cool, the master of ceremonies unaided by electronic\nwizardry.\n\nThe room offered a panoramic view of the Santa Cruz Mountains,\nwhich rolled northwestward toward San Francisco. The five board\nmembers and a couple of Wallaby's senior executives faced this\nview, while the less senior executives sat with their backs to\nthe windows. Peter Jones had personally selected every person for\nhis or her position in this room, most of them more than eight\nyears ago.\n\nSitting here, waiting, Matthew Locke's confidence began to\nfalter. The expressions around the table were grim, as all were\naware of the forthcoming conflict. Had Matthew inspected the\ntrashcan beside the security desk in the building's lobby, he\nwould have found several discarded copies of the \"Wall Street\nJournal,\" each affixed with a small mailing label addressed to\none of the persons seated around the table. Each would have read\nthe article predicting changes in this very board meeting, and\nwould know that the speculations were about to be substantiated.\nLike the emotionally battered children of distraught and\nnoncommunicative parents, those in the room would have to choose\nto which parent they would commit their trust, to the man who\ncould best repair Wallaby and lead the company from its stalled\nstate to a prosperous future. While he had already gained secret\nvotes of confidence from every person present, he was nonetheless\nstruck in the pit of his stomach by a gross realization. Here he\nsat among men and women expressly chosen by Peter for their\nroles, in this room whose design Peter had personally approved,\nin this building that was only one of many representing the\ncompany that Peter Jones had founded, in this little town to\nwhich he had brought international recognition. Did Matthew\nreally believe, as he sat here waiting, that he could actually\nunseat Peter from this very room? From this very legend?\n\nWith an imperceptible shudder, Matthew flung this thought from\nhis mind and replaced it with memories of the time and energy he\nhad invested in preparation for this day.\n\nSeated to his right and facing the windows was Hank Towers,\nassistant chairman, and Wallaby's primary investor. Over the past\nseveral months Matthew had spent a considerable amount of time\nwith Hank, and he had agreed with most of Matthew's ideas about\nhow Wallaby should be managed. He had pored over the reports and\nstrategies that Matthew collected, giving particular attention to\na recent Harvard Business School study that described a\nphenomenon with which every successful company must eventually\ncontend. It stated that by the time a business is ten years old,\nits original founders have left. There were exceptions, of\ncourse. The founding pair of Hewlett-Packard, for example, had\nremained with the company for several decades and both still held\ndirectorial roles. And, a little closer to the issue at hand was\nICP, which was founded in the 1930s by Jonathan Holmes, who had\nstayed on for half a century before turning the business over to\nhis son, Byron. But in most cases the departure of a founder was\na natural occurrence. Typically, he or she left to begin a new\nventure, however the second most prevalent manner of departure\nwas less amicable; the founder was forced out of the company\nbecause he or she was hampering rather than helping the company.\nIf anyone could appreciate this it was Hank. Three years ago he\nhad persuaded Peter to let him begin a worldwide search for a\ncandidate who could take his place as president of Wallaby,\nmanaging its day-to-day operations. What's more, it was Hank who\nhad recommended Matthew after reading about him in \"Business\nWeek.\" The story had commended Matthew's successes at\nInternational Foods, noting that he was one of the youngest and\nmost effective Fortune 500 presidents, and speculating that he\nwas being groomed by International's stuffy and conservative\nchairman, Rolland Worthy, to take the elder's place when he\nretired.\n\nBut today his reputation as the once-mighty leader of a large\nfood and beverage company gave him little faith in his strategy,\nwhich was beginning to taste more and more stale each passing\nminute.\n\nThe door opened and Peter Jones entered the room. All around the\ntable the members rearranged themselves, sitting more erect,\nseeming to have acquired a sudden intense interest in the figures\nand data and notes piled before them - anything to avoid making\neye contact with the newest and final arrival. Dressed in a\nfaultlessly fitted Armani suit, crisp white shirt and subdued\nfloral patterned tie, Peter gave the impression of a corporate\nmessiah, capable of both vision and leadership. He appeared well\nrested and cheery as he entered the room, his eyes scanning the\ntable warmly.\n\nMatthew's stomach flipped. No amount of planning or rehearsing\ncould have prepared him for the aura of power emanating from his\nrival. Even after working with him for more than twenty-four\nmonths, Matthew still felt mildly intimidated in the young man's\npresence.\n\nPeter seated himself directly across from Matthew, twenty feet\nopposite, and opened his smooth, black leather portfolio. They\nexchanged an expressionless stare, which was broken when Martin\nCohn, vice president of corporate development and liaison to the\nboard of directors, began the meeting.\n\n\"We don't have an agenda to hand out today,\" Martin said with\nuncharacteristic seriousness. \"Let's begin.\" He nodded to\nMatthew, then diverted his attention out the window, avoiding\nPeter's puzzled expression.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nGreta Locke awoke with no great desire to leave her warm bed. She\nhad slept fitfully; Matthew had tossed and bucked through the\nnight, and the few times she tried to soothe or comfort him, he\nhad turned on his side with an irked sigh.\n\nShe wondered if the board meeting at Wallaby had started. It\ndidn't matter really, everything was going to be just fine.\nStretching, she sat up and adjusted her silk gloves. She leaned\nacross the bed to the night table and opened its drawer, taking\nfrom it a fine Swiss biscuit that she unwrapped and bit into as\nshe pulled the sheets from her body and got out of bed. She\ndidn't feel like taking a shower, not right now, anyway. She took\nher silk robe from the door hook as she passed the bathroom.\n\nSlowly she descended the stairs. With each step her mind turned\nover her options for the day ahead. Stanford Mall? Union Square\nagain? Clothes? Gourmet food?\n\nHer housekeeper, Marie, appeared at the bottom of the stairway.\nShe was wearing rubber gloves and carrying a bucket filled with a\nstrong-smelling ammonia solution. She greeted Greta with an\nobedient smile.\n\n\"Mrs. Locke, I cleaned the windows on the patio outside.\"\n\n\"Fine, I'll inspect them,\" Greta said, pivoting from the last\nstep.\n\nShe strolled into the large black and white tiled kitchen and\nopened the refrigerator. As she reached for the pitcher of\nfresh-squeezed orange juice, she noticed an open bottle of Mumm\nchampagne resting on the back shelf. Why not a mimosa, she\ndecided, to celebrate Matthew's success.\n\nShe tugged the elaborate silver stopper from the bottle. It\npopped weakly, and the champagne fizzed lightly as she topped off\nher half-full glass of orange juice.\n\nGive yourself a hand, she thought wryly, remembering back to the\nfirst time she and Matthew had toasted with drinks. This came to\nmind every time she had a fizzy juice cocktail. They had met at\nInternational Foods' advertising agency. She had been hired as a\nhand model. It was what she, Gretchen Bonner, had done before she\nhad met Matthew. In her lovely hand she had been holding a can of\nOrange Fresh, a new, all-natural carbonated orange beverage.\nWhile at the agency for another meeting, Matthew had dropped in\non the shoot. His eyes had locked on the beautiful hand wrapped\naround his newest beverage invention. He followed the hand to the\narm to the body to the face. Holding his creation perfectly still\nin her hand, the woman glanced at Matthew and smiled. She was\nperfect for the part, and when the shoot was over he offered her\na glass of International Foods' own brand of vodka over ice. She\naccepted the drink, warning him that she would become woozy if\nshe drank it straight on the rocks. She poured Orange Fresh into\nthe glass and took a sip. She said she liked it better that way,\nsweet. At that very instant, unknown to either of them, she had\nsingle-handedly invented a multimillion dollar market segment for\nInternational Foods, for which Matthew would later garner\nconsiderable praise.\n\nMarie entered the kitchen. Forgetting discretion, the servant\nallowed her critical gaze to rest for a moment too long on the\nopen bottle of champagne in Greta's hand. Bad move.\n\nGreta placed the bottle on the granite counter, set down her\nglass and, walking toward the long, sweeping kitchen windows,\nremoved the glove from her right hand. \"Marie,\" she called.\n\nMarie, who had gone back to her business, faced her employer. She\nbrushed her hand across her blinking eyes, which showed the\neffects of ammonia vapors.\n\n\"I think these need cleaning too,\" Greta said, running her index\nfinger along the windows. She smirked.\n\n\"Of course, Mrs. Locke.\"\n\n\"And don't forget the outside,\" Greta added, picking up her\ndrink. She gulped down half of it, then poured the remainder of\nthe champagne into her glass. She left the empty bottle on the\ncounter, and opened the refrigerator again and searched its open\nshelves for breakfast. She took a plastic container and opened\nit. Inside were two slices of veal left over from last night's\nmeal. She ate one of the slices. The sauce was congealed and\nhardened, but the meat tasted good, and she licked the oily shine\nfrom her fingers. Her mood was returning to normal.\n\nGreta exited the kitchen and stretched out on the couch in the\nsitting room. Her hand found the remote control between the\ncushions and she pointed the thing at the television and pressed\nits buttons, sipping her drink as the screen flipped through\nchannels. Her mind flipped through its own channels, still\ncontemplating what to do with her day.\n\nShe stopped on a commercial showing a young, laughing couple\nrunning along a beach hand in hand. It was interspersed with\nquick, one-second images of cocktails, dancing, dining. It\nconcluded with the pair on horseback, galloping down the beach\ninto the sunset, leaving her with the message: \"Live again!\"\n\nShe tucked the device between the pillows and set her empty glass\non the coffee table; she had resolved today's activity dilemma.\n\nIn the bedroom she tossed her robe onto the bed. Hesitating, she\nconsidered showering. She decided against it; she'd only get\ndirty again in an hour or so. She pulled on jeans, a rugged\ncotton shirt, and a scarf. From the closet she collected her\nriding boots and a vest. She refreshed her color with a slash of\nblush across each cheek. Running a brush through her hair, she\ncaught the white flash of the remaining silk glove shrouding her\nleft hand. Casting her glance out the window, she removed it and\ntook a pair of worn leather riding gloves from her vest pocket.\nShe put them on, taking extra care with the left one, adjusting\nit carefully so that it appeared to fit naturally. There.\n\nShe backed her car from the garage and slid her sunglasses on her\nface and cruised down the twisting road, feeling a little buzzed\nas the convertible gained speed, the wind whipping all around\nher.\n\nThis area of Woodside was hilly and lush. Either side of the road\noccasionally gave way to gated driveways or hedged walls. At\ncertain bends, off to the right and downhill, she could see the\nsmall, artificial lake resting in the middle of this particular\nsmart-set valley. It was a short drive, her destination within\nwalking distance of her home had she chosen to take the footpath\nthat circled the lake.\n\nShe turned onto the long private drive. The hot pavement turned\nto dusty road as she approached the ranch. She passed a small\nstilted shed that marked the property line of the ranch. To the\nright, in a liberally spaced cluster, were two cottages, a ranch\nhouse, a small stable, and a second, larger double-door barn.\nDressage and jumping rings were not far from these buildings,\nseparated from the lake by a dirt path. In one of the fenced\ncircles a trainer led a tethered Morgan colt in medium-sized\ncircles, gently guiding the shining black animal with a long\nlunge whip. In another ring a young girl neatly sailed a black\nHanoverian over post-and-rail jumps, under the instruction of a\ntall man dressed in mixed hues of indigo. Greta had never seen\nthe man here before. From this distance he appeared lithe and\nattractive, and her curiosity was piqued. As if sensing her\nappraisal, he turned and looked in her direction. He leveled his\nhand against his brow to shield the sunlight. As he did this, she\nnoticed that he was wearing an odd white garment over his right\narm; it took her an instant to realize it was a sling.\n\nShe raised her sunglasses from her face and settled them in her\nhair. Had the man been looking at her or at something else\nnearby? He turned back to the rider, signing with a wave, then\nturned and jogged out of the ring, disappearing into the smaller\nbarn.\n\nShe climbed out of the car and proceeded to the massive double\ndoors. Inside, she was surrounded on either side by large\nbeautiful horses of various breeds. Their heads turned in her\ndirection as she passed. Occasionally she stopped to pet a\nparticular animal owned by an acquaintance. She grew excited by\nthe smell of the horses, the dust, the feed, and the dryness, and\nwas glad she had decided to come here to ride. When she wasn't\nshopping or doing the other things that consumed the hours of her\nday, this was her passion, being here at the ranch with these\nbeautiful, powerful creatures.\n\nStall 28, at the end of a long row, held Mighty Boy, her\nfour-year-old thoroughbred stallion. So black he was almost\npurple, Mighty Boy had been a gift from Matthew when they had\nmoved to California.\n\n\"Hi sweetie,\" Greta said, stroking the animal's head. She nuzzled\nher face into his cheek, her chestnut hair mixing and mingling\nwith his black mane. The horse nodded and whinnied, happy for her\narrival.\n\n\"Hello, Mrs. Locke,\" said Jennifer, the ranch's owner. She was a\nsolid woman with white-gray hair and eternally sun-squinted eyes.\n\"What a happy boy he is,\" Jennifer said. \"Everyone who sees him\nis in awe of his beauty.\"\n\n\"He is a pretty boy, isn't he?\" Greta said. She paused to\nappraise the animal for a moment before leading him out of his\nstall.\n\nJennifer slipped Mighty Boy a treat and patted his head.\n\"Gorgeous day for a ride.\"\n\n\"Truly,\" Greta agreed. Peripherally, a movement caught her eye.\nIt was the man she'd seen in the ring, dressed in denim pants and\na worn denim shirt. He was walking toward them. She became\nconscious of her tousled hair, and tried to remember whether or\nnot she had brushed her teeth. Yet she did not fully connect\nthese concerns with the materialization of this stranger.\n\n\"You must be the fortunate owner of this magnificent beast,\" the\nsmiling man said. His lean, strong jaw and powerful physique were\nmatched by a robust, accented voice.\n\n\"Yes,\" Greta said with evident pride.\n\nHe was taller than he had first appeared when she spotted him in\nthe ring, a hair over six feet, she estimated. He had hazel eyes,\nand his dark brown hair was long and thick and pulled back into a\nneat ponytail. She guessed he was in his mid-thirties.\n\n\"Jennifer?\" the man said, turning to the ranch's owner.\n\n\"Oh! I'm sorry.\" The older woman placed a casual hand on Greta's\nshoulder. \"Jean-Pierre Poitras, this is Mrs. Greta Locke.\" At the\n\"Mrs.\" part, her voice had risen ever so slightly.\n\nGreta offered her right hand, then realized her mistake. He\nlaughed, and with his left hand he gestured at his slung arm.\nStaring at it, she saw that there was no cast. \"We can use this\nhand,\" Jean-Pierre said. Before she had a chance to realize what\nwas happening, he had her left hand in his own.\n\nShe gasped, recoiling her hand like a viper. She clasped it\nprotectively in her other hand, as if it had been scalded.\n\nJean-Pierre's face mirrored her own astonished expression.\nJennifer's too.\n\nGreta attempted to cover the awkwardness. \"Oh,\" she said with a\nnervous laugh, \"I'm sorry. It's just that you startled me.\"\nUnconsciously she was gently squeezing the hand he'd held, trying\nto imagine how it had felt to him. Horrorstricken, she asked\nherself, Did he feel it?\n\nThere was a long moment of silence in which everyone looked to\neveryone else. Finally, Jennifer spoke. \"Jean-Pierre is a polo\nchampion from Deauville, France.\"\n\nGreta seized on this to move the conversation along. \"Really? How\nfascinating. Are you playing polo here?\"\n\nHe laughed at this, and everything seemed to fall back in order.\n\"There is no polo here. That is why I've come.\"\n\nJennifer explained. \"We're considering starting a polo club right\nhere in Woodside, Mrs. Locke. Perhaps Mr. Locke would be\ninterested in sponsoring a player.\" This last comment was\ndirected to Jean-Pierre. He arched his brows, inviting an\nexplanation.\n\nInstead of responding to this, Greta let go of her hand and\nfluttered it uneasily at his arm. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"Oh, this. My nemesis. Chronic dislocation. Shoulder. Worst it\nhas ever been. I figured it was time to give my pony a rest and\nlook into the idea of starting a club here. I need some time to\nrecuperate.\" His eyes connected with hers, and for the moment\nthat she held them, she felt as if he were acknowledging some\nunspoken confidence that they shared.\n\nJennifer spoke up. \"We're delighted he's going to be staying with\nus for awhile.\" With a click of her tongue she began leading\nMighty Boy along.\n\nJean-Pierre stopped her and took the horse by the halter. \"May\nI?\" he asked Greta.\n\n\"Oh. Why, yes,\" she replied.\n\nJennifer patted Mighty Boy's head. \"Have a nice ride,\" she said,\nand walked back toward the office.\n\nGreta studied Jean-Pierre as he led the animal from its stall\nwith a firm but casual hand. Mighty Boy tramped along happily,\nunresisting, as they walked the length of the stable in silence.\nOutside they stepped aside to allow the young groom to bridle and\nsaddle the animal.\n\nJean-Pierre plucked a pair of sunglasses from his shirt pocket.\n\"Perhaps we can ride together one morning, Mrs. Locke?\" He\ngrinned. Perfect straight white teeth contrasted with his\nhealthy, tanned complexion. There was something suggestive in his\nfixed smile.\n\nShe felt herself blush. \"Perhaps,\" she said. She had a\npremonition that was not altogether unpleasant. Before she had\ntime to let the image develop any further, she quickly busied\nherself with the saddle's girth and stirrups. She could feel his\neyes observing her. It felt intrusive, yet, at the same time,\nexciting. She nullified this indulgence by reminding herself of\ntoday's board meeting at Wallaby; its conclusion would signal a\nnew beginning for her and Matthew. She pulled her scarf from her\nvest pocket, twirled it, and wrapped it lightly around her neck.\nThe lenses of his sunglasses reflected her motions, but she could\nnot tell on what exactly his eyes were focused, though they\nseemed fixed in the general direction of her upper body. Her\nbreasts. At this thought she felt a prickling beneath her skin.\nFirst chilly. Then hot.\n\n    Feeling suddenly loony and playful, she stared directly into\nhis sunglasses, as if she were facing a small display mirror.\nWith a bold tug she knotted her scarf and laughed, and at the\nsame time cinched her commitment to Matthew.\n\nHis own hearty laughter joined hers, filling her with an\nuncharacteristic and powerful sense of triumph.\n\nShe placed her booted foot into the stirrup, and his deft\nattention was little surprise as his free hand solidly gripped\nher other boot. With a quick hoist she was in the saddle.\n\nHe stood before Mighty Boy and stroked the horse's head. \"Such a\nbeautiful creature,\" he said, removing his sunglasses, \"should\ncertainly be allowed to jump, to learn new things. Yes? Maybe you\nwould like to try?\" He lifted his sunglasses and held them so\nthat their eyes connected. He held hers for more time than she\nshould have permitted. She quickly diverted her gaze to the\njumping ring. Could she do that? Wait - why was she even\nconsidering it? She told herself to get going. Besides, she had\nnot showered, and her hair was all mussed. Hadn't she come here\nto ride her horse?\n\n\"I don't think I could do that,\" she said. \"I think I prefer\nsimply riding alone.\"\n\nHe lowered his sunglasses again and bowed, as if to say that was\nfine. For now.\n\n\"Well, then. See you,\" she said. She was satisfied with the way\nthat had come out, a practiced social indifference to her tone.\nPressing her heels into the horse's ribs, she trotted off past\nthe buildings and toward the hills across the low, golden, grassy\nfield. She let herself look back. He was still standing there,\nwatching her ride off. She hastily returned her attention to the\npath.\n\nAfter Mighty Boy warmed up she pushed him hard, leaning into his\npowerful gallop. As if testing her will, yesterday's clear, hard\nthoughts of Matthew's secret plan and of her celebration bowl\nmelted away, and were supplanted by fantasy. Her heart raced, and\nher mind ran free with raw and fiery images of the provocative\nJean-Pierre.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\"Thank you, Martin,\" Matthew Locke said.\n\nPeter turned to Hank Towers for an explanation for this break in\ncustom; it was he, Peter, who always started the meeting with\nopening remarks. But Hank's attention, like that of everyone else\nin the room, had shifted to Matthew. Something was wrong, but\nbefore he could speculate, Matthew spoke.\n\n\"As we are all aware, Peter and I have been at odds about how\nthis company should be managed.\"\n\nPeter threw his pen down on the table. With an audible huff he\npushed himself back in his seat with straightened arms. \"What's\ngoing on here?\"\n\nMatthew ignored this and continued, his eyes roaming from person\nto person in careful, measured doses.\n\n\"Peter and I have very different styles and strategies, which is\npositioning you, the executive staff and board of directors, in\nthe middle of our discord. The situation isn't healthy for\nWallaby.\" He let this sink in for a moment while he got up and\nwalked toward a pitcher of water. Slowly he poured himself a\nglass.\n\n\"Peter,\" he started, resting the glass, \"I've decided to ask the\nboard of directors to accept my resignation - \"\n\nPeter could not believe his ears, and before Matthew had even\nfinished with his explanation Peter was already celebrating\ninside. Hallelujah! Here he had thought that Matthew was going to\npropose a reorganization, but instead he was resigning. It was\npriceless! Maybe, Peter thought, Matthew had realized himself\nthat he was not cut out for high technology, and would be better\noff going back into the potato chip business, with its bright\ncolored plastic bags, its brainwashing the public on the virtues\nof junk food, its pureeing of rotten ingredients -\n\n\" - provided,\" Matthew continued, \"that they don't approve my\nrecommendation that you relinquish your duties as Wallaby's vice\npresident of Joey, and chairman of the board.\"\n\nThe room spun. Suddenly, all eyes were fixed on Peter. He\nblinked, and tried to focus on a single pair, but those glanced\naway, as did the next pair, and the next. He leaned back in his\nchair. It squeaked loudly. He looked up at the whiteness of the\nceiling for a moment and let his mind drain. Suddenly he\nunderstood Matthew's little game. He laughed at the ceiling. For\na split second he had actually thought it could somehow be true,\nthat Matthew was going to resign, that that was what Matthew was\ntrying to warn him of, threaten him with yesterday. Such was not\nthe case. Resigning was the farthest thing from Matthew's mind.\nThe absurdity - proposing that the board give him the boot.\nAdmittedly, considering the rumors that were flying about a\nreorganization, he'd been more than a little apprehensive late\nlast night. But upon waking this morning, he'd told himself there\nwas nothing to fear. He was the company's founder, and he wasn't\ngoing anywhere - except where he damn well pleased. This was\npreposterous. It was laughable. And he laughed hard and full, his\nshoulders pitching a little. None of the others joined in the\nfun.\n\nWhen he managed to get his laughter under control, he\nstraightened up and placed his clasped hands comfortably in his\nlap. \"Sorry,\" he said, squeezing his eyes shut for a moment. He\ngave himself a little shake, and blew out an exaggerated breath.\n\"Forgive me for laughing, Matthew,\" he said with a smile,\nflattening his hand over his heart, \"You had me going there for a\nsecond. I thought you were going to make my job easy.\"\n\nHis smile vanished. \"But I guess you're not. So I'll spell it out\nfor you.\" His face was relaxed and smooth, and he spoke coolly.\n\"Matthew, you're not right for Wallaby anymore,\" he said. He let\nthis hang in the air for a few moments. To his way of thinking,\nas chairman, his decision was already made. Out of courtesy he\nwould explain to Matthew the circumstances, as a coach would\nafter try-outs to the child who doesn't have what it takes to\nmake the team.\n\n\"You did a good job of helping to get the organization in place\nfor managing us through troubled waters. You created a strong\nsales force, and you did some other good things. I can't remember\nthem all right now, but you did some okay things. However, were\nyou to remain in your position any longer, this company would\nfail because of your weakness. You have no vision.\"\n\nAll this time Matthew had remained on his feet. Peter was\nimpressed with how well he was taking it. Let's see, Peter\nthought, how he handles this part.\n\nPeter opened his leather portfolio, which contained copies of the\norganizational chart he had prepared yesterday, listing himself\nas the acting president and CEO. \"I think we can work out a\nrespectable severance package, with full relocation, of course,\"\nhe said, graciously, \"and - \"\n\n\"Peter, \" Matthew said, cutting him off.\n\nOh wonderful, Peter thought, just what he had feared. Matthew was\ngoing to beg to stay. Yet he saw no sign of anguish on Matthew's\nface. Perhaps he was experiencing shock?\n\n\"You're a brilliant young man,\" Matthew said. \"You've made this\nindustry what it is. Were it not for you, we all know this\ncompany could never have been.\" His words flowed easily, without\ntremor.\n\n\"You had a dream to make portable computers for individuals, and\nyou created this company out of sheer willpower and brains.\nEveryone here acknowledges that.\"\n\nThis was worse than Peter had thought. How long would he and his\nteam have to sit through this, he wondered. Should he stop him\nnow, and thank him? No, he told himself. Let him finish. After\nall, he had hired Matthew, and if anyone was to blame, it was he,\nfor not realizing that a potato chip man could not be transformed\ninto a silicon chip man. At this last thought he felt the start\nof a giggle in his chest, and he was forced to bow his head and\npinch his lips tightly together to contain his laughter.\n\nMatthew paused. What Peter didn't see were the sympathetic\nglances sent his way by the members of his hand-picked team. He\nresumed, \"I was hired to complement you so that you could\nconcentrate on developing your product ideas without the burden\nof managing a rapidly growing organization...\"\n\nResigned to listening to the rest of Matthew's good-bye speech,\nPeter let his mind concentrate on important things. Leaking\nbatteries, for instance. Longer screen life. Easy-to-service\nkeyboards. Storage. Faster performance. Yes, that one was\nbecoming more and more important. Must have faster performance.\n\nMatthew's voice had become a faraway drone. \"But I cannot do my\njob without having the power to fulfill my responsibilities. You\nhave managed to create a rivalry with your once-greatest fans...\"\n\nWhat else? Agents. Now there was a subject he had become more and\nmore interested in. Which reminds me, Peter thought, I've got to\ncall the guys at MIT and see what they've come up with that we\nmight use with the -\n\n\"IJoey Plus computer is late for delivery because of your\ninability to manage your organization. All that must change.\"\n\nHe sensed that Matthew was winding down, and focused once again\non the here and now. Glad tidings, etcetera.\n\n\"So I have decided to ask each member of the board and executive\nstaff to vote.\"\n\nPeter looked at Matthew. \"And what are we going to vote on,\nMatthew?\" he asked, his voice pitched a good deal higher than\nusual.\n\n\"As I said,\" Matthew went on, planting both of his hands on the\nback of his vacant chair, \"I cannot do my job as long as you have\nthe final say in everything. I am asking the board and the\nexecutive staff to decide which of us will run this company. If\nthey choose you, I will resign.\"\n\nHe looked around the room. Everyone seemed to think their blank\nnotepads were fascinating.\n\n\"Matthew, now I'm getting angry,\" Peter said, rising from his\nseat. Unconsciously he began popping the button of his ball-point\npen up and down with his thumb. \"Can we please stop this\ndesperate little game?\"\n\n\"This is no game. I am perfectly serious. And as this company's\npresident, I intend to conduct a vote.\"\n\nThe clicking stopped. \"A vote? Then be my guest,\" he said,\nsweeping a hand at the mannequins seated around the table. \"Go\nahead, Matthew, ask. Ask everyone in this room who they want to\nrun my company.\"\n\nHands in his pockets, Peter began to pace slowly around the room,\nlike an impatient father awaiting the inevitable. \"Wait,\" Peter\nsaid. \"Better still, Matthew, I'll ask, okay?\"\n\nMatthew shrugged deferentially.\n\nPeter stepped behind Alan Parker, general manager of the Mate\ndivision, the first executive Peter had hired when he had founded\nWallaby.\n\n\"Alan,\" Peter said, resting his hand on Parker's shoulder. \"What\ndo you think about all of this? Pretty awkward, I agree. But\nnothing we can't take care of, right? Do I need to repeat the\nquestions? Who do you think should be in control here at our\ncompany?\"\n\nParker sat upright, his attention focused on his hands, which he\nheld tightly clasped together on the table. Normally a warm and\nfriendly person, Parker had worked as Peter's right-hand man\nduring the early years of Wallaby when they had found themselves\na major force in the Fortune 500. He removed his glasses and\nbrushed the back of his hand across his forehead. His dread was\npalpable.\n\n\"Yes, Peter,\" Parker said, his voice struggling against fond\nmemories, \"we did build Wallaby into a wonderful thing. And if it\nweren't for you, this industry would have never become what it is\ntoday. However, you and your Joey team have created a rivalry\nwith my Mate group. My division, which provides the butter for\nour bread, feels that you, the very inventor of our livelihood,\nthink the Mate, and my people who work on it, are second-class\ncitizens.\"\n\nHe swiveled in his chair to look at Peter with his complaisant,\npleading eyes. \"Because of the way you behave I can't do my job,\neither. It's like you've abandoned your roots in favor of Joey,\nlike you've forgotten all about the millions of people, the\nmillions of children, who use a Mate computer every day. Mate is\nyour family, and we feel abandoned.\"\n\nPeter moved his face closer to Parker's. \"Spare me the history,\nAl. Okay? I'm sorry if you're sensitive about the way things may\nseem, but face it, you know our future lies in Joey. What do you\nneed to hear? What can I say to make you feel better? I think you\nand your group do a great job keeping Mate alive, and you can\ntell them I said so. I'll even tell them myself. I'll come over\nevery other week, if that's what you want, and pat them on the\nback. Matthew can't do that. He can't even work a Mate computer.\nHow the hell is he going to talk to the people who keep it\nalive?\"\n\nParker stiffened. \"That's not the point. Don't you see? You're\ndoing it right now. Doing what you always do, changing and\ntwisting things around to suit you. Only you.\"\n\nIn all their years of working together, Parker had never spoken\nto him like this. It was as if the man had suddenly aged and\nhardened before his eyes.\n\n\"We're not a little start-up company anymore, Peter,\" Parker\nexploded. \"We're big business, and we need to be run like a big\nbusiness. And that includes taking care of the people who got us\nhere!\"\n\nAn unpleasant taste shot up from Peter's throat. He already knew\nwhat Parker's vote would be. And if Parker, who was easily his\nleast problematic executive, felt his way, what about the others?\n\nAlan Parker narrowed his eyes and slowly shook his head. His face\nsoftened, and for a moment he was once again the kind and\ngrateful man Peter remembered. \"Peter, I believe Matthew has what\nit takes to run this company. But I also believe you should lead\nour new product development - \"\n\nPeter lifted a hand, cutting the executive off. \"Save it,\" he\nsaid, patting Parker stiffly on the shoulder. \"So, everyone\nthinks I'm a jerk. But it was this hot-shot businessman,\" he\nsaid, flinging a hand towards Matthew, \"who let things get to\nthis point of confusion and misunderstanding.\"\n\nMatthew stood. \"Peter, I want us to work together, but for me to\nbe able to manage Wallaby, you need to let me have the power to\ndo what's right from a business standpoint.\"\n\n\"Well forget it, Matthew,\" Peter said. \"And let's cut all this\ncrybaby sentimental crap too, okay? Okay. Fine. If this is how\nyou want to play the game, we'll just go around the room and ask\neveryone if they want me out.\" He leaned against the window\nledge, in the exact section Matthew had just vacated. He squeezed\nthe ledge on either side with his hands, white-knuckled, as if\nthis would somehow anchor his place in the room.\n\n\"All right, who's next?\" Peter said, his voice bordering on\nhysteria. \"Let's see. Denise. You. Just a simple yes if you think\nMatthew should have final power. No drama, please, we've all got\na lot of work to do today.\"\n\nDenise Campbell had started her career with Wallaby as a\nfinancial analyst. Young and bright and a genius with numbers,\nDenise's long record of successes had recently been rewarded by\nPeter, who had promoted her to the role of CFO. With anguished\neyes, she faced Peter. \"As a publicly held company, our first\nobligation is to our shareholders.\"\n\nPeter held up his hand again, stopping her before she could go\ninto a long-winded justification. \"No verbosity, please, just a\nyes or no.\" His eyes blazed.\n\nShe looked into her lap. \"Yes,\" she said. \"But Peter, you have to\nstay on as - \"\n\nEyes closed, he turned away from her with a disgusted expression\nand a quick shake of his head.\n\nPaul Crane, executive vice president of sales and marketing, was\nregarded by everyone for his no-bullshit manner, which he now\ndemonstrated with a simple nod of his head.\n\nMatthew stood off to the side, watching the process without\nexpression. It went on like this until the entire executive staff\nwas polled. Then Peter queried each of the visiting directors,\nwho had flown in from different parts of the country to attend\nthe meeting. Not a single no was spoken. When Matthew counted all\nbut the final response, he stiffened, awaiting the finale.\n\nPeter knelt before Hank Towers.\n\n\"Hank,\" Peter said, his voice a desperate croak. \"You, more than\nanyone else in this room, know what Wallaby means to me.\" He\ndrummed his chest with his palm. \"You and I, Hank, we made\nWallaby everything it is today. Didn't I agree with you a few\nyears ago that we needed someone to run the company? And wasn't I\nsupportive when we hired Matthew? We made a mistake is all, and\nno one gets it. But you do. I know you do.\"\n\nHank sat perfectly still, but Matthew could see that Peter's\nwords were having an effect on him. And on some of the others.\nSounds of sniffing and little coughs, throats clearing, filled\nthe room.\n\nMatthew's pulse quickened. Although everyone else in the room had\nvoted in his favor, Hank could essentially persuade them all to\ncompromise in Peter's favor, dissolving Matthew's ultimatum. If\nHank did that, the plan would be off.\n\n\"Hank, you have to trust me on this one,\" Peter implored.\n\"Matthew isn't right for Wallaby. If you let him have this, he'll\nturn Wallaby into a second-rate company. All I want is for us to\nbe number one, Hank. It's all we've ever wanted, right?\"\n\nMatthew sweated to read Hank's expression. Had he been kidding\nhimself into thinking he could lure Hank's loyalty away from\nPeter.\n\n\"Damn it, Hank, look at me. Don't you see what he really wants?\nHe wants us, the renegades, to connect to IC-fucking-P's\ncomputers! If that's not selling out, man, what is?\"\n\nMatthew held his breath, for Peter's assessment was ultimately\nthe motivation behind his entire secret plan. And if this\nrevelation, however ridiculous it may have sounded, caused Hank\nto waver, to trust Peter's instincts, then Matthew had not a\nsingle grain of hope of ever succeeding with his monumental plan.\nHe heard the sound of his own heartbeat squishing wildly in his\nears.\n\nHank looked Peter in the eye, and slowly shook his head.\n\nPeter grunted. It was a wrenching, painful sound.\n\n\"Hank, no. No, Hank. No.\" He spoke very slowly, pausing with\nevery few words to catch his breath. \"We did it before. And we\ncan do it again.\" He planted his hands on Hank's shoulders and\ngave him the sort of shake one gives a drunkard. \"We can run\nWallaby. Until we find someone who can cut it. Hank.\"\n\nHank gently removed Peter's hands from his shoulders.\n\n\"No, Peter,\" Hank whispered. \"No.\"\n\n\"Hank, this is my life we're talking about, here. You will kill\nme if you don't save me.\" Tears spilled down Peter's cheeks.\n\"You're my only hope.\"\n\nHank rested his hand on Peter's shoulder. \"Petey, we're a big\ncompany now, at probably the most critical point in all our\nhistory. You are too unfocused to manage Wallaby. Matthew can.\"\nHe punctuated this last line with a squeeze. \"But you've got to\nstay on and be the innovator. We only want you to let Matthew do\nhis job. You'll think this is all bad for awhile, but then you'll\nunderstand. You'll be a lot happier focusing on future products.\"\nHe let out a huge, exasperated sigh. \"For Chrissake, Peter, we\nlove you.\"\n\nPeter slowly rose to his feet. Matthew was rounding the table,\ncoming toward him.\n\n\"And if I don't agree to all this?\" Peter said to Hank.\n\n\"I'm afraid it's the only option you've got.\"\n\nPeter could think of a few others. For example, he thought with\nmorbid pleasure, he could pummel Matthew with punches, that was\none option, or he could choke him until he turned red, then blue,\nthen black and begged for his life while everyone sat there as\nthey had through the whole meeting, staring at their fucking\nyellow pads, just dying to lift their pens, Wallaby logo pens,\nand begin calculating what their stock options would be worth\nafter today's news got out.\n\nAnd wasn't that what it all came down to in the end, he asked\nhimself. Wasn't that what he'd used to lure each and every one of\nthem there? The bottom line. Didn't they understand that for him,\nit wasn't the money. His life's happiness was the bottom line.\nAnd he had just lost it. With this thought a deep dread coursed\nthrough his chest. He thought of last night, and he felt a\nshudder, as though an ice-cold fear had poked its finger into his\nrectum. He felt as if he were about to defecate, right there for\nall of them to witness, his grand exit. He was coming apart from\nthe inside out.\n\nWith every last ounce of strength he willed himself to stop\nshaking, to compose himself as best he could. He lifted his chin.\n\"Wallaby is my life,\" he said, his voice high and distraught.\n\"But as you've all determined for me, that doesn't matter\nanymore.\"\n\nMatthew came closer. \"It doesn't have to end like this,\" he said.\n\"I want you to stay with me. I want you to make our future while\nI manage the present.\" He reached out to Peter.\n\n\"Don't you come near me!\" Peter screamed, flinging his hands into\nthe air. Several of the people in the room jumped in their seats,\ngroaning in agony at what they were being forced to witness.\n\nTheir eyes linked for the last time. \"You've stolen my life,\nMatthew.\" He faced the people seated at he table. But he had\nnothing more to say. He turned and charged for the door.\n\nMartin Cohn leapt from his chair and started after him.\n\n\"Leave him,\" Hank ordered, fixing his eyes sharply on Matthew.\n\nThe door slowly and silently swung inward, sealing the new team\ntogether inside the room for the first time without Peter Jones.\n\nMatthew couldn't see Hank's gaze. He was facing the sunlit\nwindow, staring down at his clenched fists. He willed them to\nrelax. And as he watched them uncurl, he felt his guilt slip\naway. And in its place he grasped a new feeling.\n\nPower.\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n\nWilliam Harrell worked through his morning in the usual fashion,\nattending three meetings, then moving on to his daily\ncorrespondence.\n\nAfter eleven o'clock he left the ICP headquarters building for a\nten-block ride to an exclusive men's athletic club whose\nclientele consisted entirely of high-level executives. Typically,\nthe club arranged rotating squash and racquetball matches between\nexecutives in similar positions from different companies and\nindustries. A president of an insurance company, for example,\nmight be paired with a CEO from an advertising agency; a TV\nexecutive with a restaurant magnate...or the chairman of the\nworld's largest computer manufacturer with chairman of the\nworld's largest food manufacturer.\n\nWaiting for his technical and business advisers to arrive for\ntheir two o'clock meeting, William stretched and considered the\nsoreness in his arms. They felt now as they had after his match\nwith Rolland Worthy, chairman and CEO of International Foods, a\nlittle over two years ago. During that match, he mused, he had\nfelt as though he'd been punched in the stomach midway through\nthe game.\n\n\"What do you know about Wallaby?\" Worthy had asked him.\n\nThe hard rubber ball struck the wall with solid force and\nrebounded toward William.\n\nHis concentration and judgment were wrecked by Rolland's\nquestion; his racquet overextended. The ball hurtled past him.\n\n\"What, I hit a nerve?\" Worthy laughed, arming his sweating\nwrinkled forehead with his shirtsleeve.\n\nWilliam crouched. \"Wallaby is a small company in Silicon Valley\nthat manufactures portable computers and those new small wonders\nreferred to as PIAs, which stands for personal interactive\nassistant,\" William said flatly. He bounced on the balls of his\nfeet, anticipating Worthy's serve.\n\nWorthy tossed the ball in the air and pounded it with his\nracquet, then dropped to a defensive footing, his actions fluid\nand youthful.\n\nWilliam smashed the ball and they played out the serve, and he\nultimately gained the ball after Worthy crashed into the wall.\n\n\"You okay?\" William huffed.\n\nWorthy gave his shoulder a quick squeeze where it had connected\nwith the wall. \"Serve,\" he ordered.\n\nWilliam served and the game continued.\n\nBefore the match, William had started the day in his\nimperturbable business-as-usual mood. He remembered the pleasure\nhe felt upon reading his business adviser's latest market-share\nreport, announcing that ICP had nearly doubled its total unit\nsales of the BP computer, compared to Wallaby's estimated total\nsales of its Mate all-in-one portable computer. But though sales\nof the BP were greater than those of the Mate, William Harrell's\nconsummate business sense counseled against feeling triumphant.\nHe rationalized that Wallaby was presumably up to something big;\nPeter Jones, Wallaby's eminent founder, had been too quiet as far\nas the press was concerned. Normally the capricious spokesman of\nthe portable computer industry, Jones had not granted a public\ninterview in more than a year, and that concerned William. Jones\nhad something up his sleeve. Something really big. The only thing\nthat kept William's fear of Jones and Wallaby from growing beyond\na mild concern to an actual loss of sleep was the fact that Jones\nwas a poor chief; though he was capable of creating innovative\nminiature computers, he was incapable of running the company.\nWithout proper guidance and leadership, Wallaby would sooner or\nlater fold.\n\nAs they headed from the court to the showers, William wiped his\nface with a towel and asked, \"All right, Rolland, fess up. Why\nall the interest in Wallaby?\"\n\n\"This is off the record, my friend. They called one of my best\nguys, Matthew Locke. They're flying him to California to\ninterview for a job as president.\"\n\nWilliam felt the color drain from his face.\n\n\"Locke, as you know, is who I'm thinking about advancing into my\nslot when I retire in a few years,\" Worthy said.\n\n\"Anyway, he stopped by my house last night and told me that he\nhad gotten a call from a headhunter and was a candidate to take\nthe lead at Wallaby, working with some kid named Peter Jones.\"\n\nWilliam remained silent, praying that Worthy would go on and\nspill everything he knew about Wallaby and its interest in Locke.\n\n\"I think Matthew wanted me to tell him he was guaranteed my job\nwhen I retire. When I told him I couldn't do that, not yet\nanyway, he said then that he was going to fly out there to\nCalifornia and see what the company was all about.\n\n\"I just can't figure it,\" Worthy remarked. He paused and slung\nhis towel over his shoulder. \"Why would some hippie bantam\ncomputer nerds want to hire the president of a company that makes\nsoda pop and chips?\"\n\nHarrell knew precisely why. What had he been mulling over all\nmorning? The only factor preventing Wallaby from becoming a bona\nfide threat was that Peter Jones lacked the business savvy\nnecessary to take his small company into big business. His\nintuition about Jones had been correct. The young man was looking\nto hire an innkeeper to run the shop so he could concentrate on\nbuilding the nifty toys.\n\n\"You think they're going to start stuffing little computers into\ncereal boxes?\" Worthy quipped with a chuckle as the two men\nheaded for the showers.\n\nDespite the hot shower, William Harrell felt washed with a\nchilling morbid dread. Not since his wife had begun her slide\ninto the final stages of cancer had he felt that same feeling of\nhelplessness that comes when loss seems inevitable.\n\nThat day was now long past. Worthy's disclosure about Wallaby had\nbeen enough to give the older man a jarring advantage that\nperhaps helped him win the squash game. But in the long run,\nWilliam smiled to himself, the aching effects he had felt in his\nmuscles after that game were a meager price to pay for what would\nbe felt by the business world, thanks to the data Worthy had\nadvanced him.\n\nHad it not been for that squash match two years ago, he\nreflected, he might still be worrying about Wallaby someday\nbecoming a serious competitor to ICP, rather than a subsidiary.\n\nWhat had started as a far-out notion that night following the\nsquash match was beginning to enter the formative stages of\nreality; the brakes would come off and the wheels would begin\nturning after Wallaby's board meeting today. His secret\nacquisition plan was the first thing to come along since Martha's\ndeath that had totally engrossed him, and he had wholeheartedly\nwelcomed the diversion as a way to overcome his grieving.\n\nWilliam dreaded the thought of the ensuing two hours during which\nhis advisors would spew figures and specifications, suggesting\ncompetitive market action and reaction, while all along he had\nbegun, more than two years ago, his own competitive market plan,\nits countdown to liftoff about to commence.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nPeter sped away from the company parking lot and raced for the\nengineering building and the solace of his office.\n\nTurning into the driveway, however, he became suddenly aware of\nthe tears streaming down his face. Cutting the wheel sharply he\nvaulted off the curb, then sped down the street. His outrage\ntoward Matthew and everyone in the boardroom for what had just\ngone down was not coming as intensely as he wished. Instead, he\nfelt only anguish. The damage was done, and he knew it was\nirreparable. Matthew had stolen control of Wallaby right from\nunder his nose, the ultimate irony being that Peter's plan was to\npropose his, Matthew's, elimination. They had all turned against\nhim.\n\nHe raced past the Wallaby buildings and headed for the highway,\nhis mind frantically searching for answers. How could he not have\nseen it coming? Where had he gone wrong? Had he any forewarning\nof this? Could he have prevented it from happening, or have\nbetter prepared for Matthew's evil force? Had there been, when he\nhad first interviewed Matthew two years ago, some clue, some\ninkling of what was to come?\n\n\n\"Are you sure you'll make it?\" Peter said nervously.\n\n\"I'm sure,\" Rick Boardman said. \"But if you don't quit breathing\ndown my neck, I'll never have it ready by four o'clock!\"\n\nRick was Peter's most prized software engineer. When Peter had\ndiscussed with Hank Towers the possibility of hiring Matthew\nLocke, he learned that Matthew was a somewhat reserved person. So\nPeter went directly to Rick, who was the programming leader on\nthe new Joey computer. Peter asked Rick to put together an\neye-popping sight-and-sound exhibition of the prototype computer,\nsomething to really show it off.\n\n\"I just hope you can do something incredible, Rick,\" Peter said.\nHe turned to leave.\n\n\"Wait,\" Rick said, taking the bait.\n\nThe programmer clicked the small button above the trackpad, and\non the screen an image of a bag of International Foods\nCrunch-Munch materialized. The bag opened, accompanied by\ncrinkling sound effects, and popcorn started exploding out of the\nbag, followed by animated, high-spirited peanut-people adorned in\ntiny colored sunglasses and striped sneakers. Each carried a\nlittle bucket. They chased after the three-dimensional popcorn\npuffs, splashing sounds resonating from the attached stereo\nspeakers as they drenched the popcorn with candy coating. A baby\nkangaroo suddenly appeared on the scene, and the little popcorn\npeople chased after it. The joey appeared to tear open a pocket\nright in the middle of the screen, then hopped inside, dropping a\nwink before vanishing. The peanut people dove in after the little\nfellow, then in the next instant they all came bursting out of\nthe pocket with a pennant, which they unfurled: \"WELCOME,\nMATTHEW,\" A chorus a children's voices screamed the same welcome\nand then the screen faded to black. Finally a phantom paintbrush\nappeared and painted the screen with the shimmering Wallaby logo.\n\nPeter grinned with extreme satisfaction and pride. Still, he laid\non a little more pressure, a little more challenge. \"Hmm. I\nwonder if you make the last part, with the paintbrush, a little\nfaster,\" he said, tracing the word \"Wallaby\" on the screen\nquickly with his finger. \"Maybe you can add that part you showed\nme last week, too, with our little Joey pointing out the device's\nfeatures with those slick animated flash cards he's got stashed\nin that secret pocket of his....\"\n\nRick nodded excitedly. \"Yeah, yeah, I can do that.\"\n\nPeter left to the staccato sound of keystrokes and clicks, and\nwent to his own office. Taking a folder from his desk, he lowered\nhimself to his stylish couch, kicked off his dock shoes,\nstretched out comfortably, and began sifting through the\ncollection of articles and clippings about Matthew Locke and\nInternational Foods, which had been mailed to both him and Hank\nearlier in the week by the headhunter they had retained for the\nsearch.\n\nIn a \"Fortune\" article entitled \"Big Business Chairman Hopefuls,\"\nMatthew Locke was the first person mentioned, accompanied by a\nhalf-page picture of the young grinning Ivy League executive\nposed before a wall of soda bottles in a super market. The\narticle predicted that Locke was being groomed to succeed\nInternational's long-time chairman and CEO, Rolland Worthy. It\ndescribed Locke's career over the past fifteen years at IF,\nlisting the numerous successful marketing programs he had\ndeveloped, all of which Peter recognized: Holy Cow ice cream,\nPresto Microwave Popcorn, and one of the most popular beverages\nof all time, Orange Fresh carbonated juice. International Foods\nhad formerly been separated into several divisions, the largest\nbeing food, beverage, subsidiary, and services. The article\nexplained how Locke had consolidated the food and beverage\ndivisions into one group, and had the services divisions rolled\nout as a subsidiary operating unit. That way, International Foods\nwas able to concentrate primarily on developing and marketing its\nmainstream products; non-retail sales were managed as a separate\nbusiness unit.\n\nPretty smart, Peter admitted. In his head, he tried to work the\nformula on Wallaby's separate product divisions, Mate, and the\nnew Joey, but did not come to the same conclusion Locke had\nreached. Each of Wallaby's divisions was unique from a\ntechnological standpoint, and incompatible, unlike food and\nbeverages which, as far as Peter was concerned, were all the\nsame. This type of solution would not work in a company like\nWallaby, Peter concluded, just as he had known it wouldn't when\nhe started the Joey project a few years ago. To create Joey, he\nhad taken a number of his top engineers from the Mate division\nand moved them into their own building. There were accusations of\nspecial privileges, and the accusations were true. Peter nursed,\nstroked, and dined his people in the Joey building. A giant\nrefrigerator was stocked with exotic foods and beverages,\nportable Walkman CD players were free, and in-office massages\nwere provided by professional masseuses and masseurs.\n\nDismissing Locke's consolidation concept as impossible at a place\nlike Wallaby, and therefore an inappropriate measure of the man's\nabilities, Peter skimmed more articles. He read interviews with\npeople who had worked for Locke over the past several years. Most\nof them reflected on his no-nonsense business attitude and keen\nmarketing abilities. One marketing analyst who had worked with\nLocke on International's now highly successful line of diet\nbeverages said that Locke often had several secret projects going\nat any given time, and as different market opportunities arose,\nhe called upon the brewing projects to launch major new products.\nThe analysts and business community, and the most important group\nof all, the consumers, perceived the new products as brilliant\nand timely. Most of them, however, had been waiting in the wings,\nin some instances, a few years, until the right moment arrived to\nmove them out of the marketing group and into the supermarket.\nOne spiteful IF manager revealed anonymously that Locke had never\nactually invented any of the products himself. The most\noutstanding example was the pull-tab, which back in the early\n1970s banished the need for a can opener. While Peter took it for\ngranted nowadays that all you had to do was pop the top on a can\nof soda to sip its contents, he could remember back to when he\nwas a boy, when you had to use a can opener to get to what was\ninside. It was this fact, that Locke was the one to introduce the\npull-tab, that appealed to Peter more than anything else. He\ncompared the metaphor to the Mate and Joey. The Mate was the\nfirst all-in-one portable computer (though inside the company\nthey referred to it as a \"luggable,\" rather than a true portable)\nthat you could easily move from room to room, place to place, but\nit was nonetheless difficult to use; you first had to understand\nthe utility \"tool\" programs that controlled the machine and its\nprograms before you could fully employ all of its features.\nGetting into the Joey, on the other hand, was easy, intuitive,\nlike using a pop-top can; all you had to do was to look at it to\nunderstand how to use it, no special tools or knowledge were\nrequired. The built-in address book and calendar and phone dialer\nand e-mail program all looked like, and behaved like, their real\nworld, paper-based counterparts. Plus, it was much smaller than\nthe Mate and truly portable, able to run on its rechargeable\nbattery for days at a time. The trackpad interface was so\nintuitive that in studies Wallaby conducted with brand new users,\nevery attendee was naturally drawn to the small black square\nwithout so much as a clue from the study group guides, their\nfingers sliding across its surface without any thought at all\nabout what they were doing. Just like the soda pull-tab.\n\nSo as for Locke's reported reputation of taking credit for what\nothers had invented, Peter felt neither surprised or concerned.\nIt was a non-issue. He was the primary inventor in the company\nand everyone, including the public, knew it. Locke was being\nconsidered because of his abilities to run the business side of\nthings, and only the business side.\n\nWhich was just fine with Peter. But what about Matthew Locke?\nWould he be content with a second-place role to Peter?\n\n\nThat question had just been answered in today's board meeting.\nThe tables had turned, and now Matthew was the star. He had used\nPeter as a pawn in his own deceitful, unscrupulous game. How long\nhad he been planning this coup?\n\nPeter mentally lashed himself for not having taken some sort of\naction when, about a year ago, Matthew had suggested that\nWallaby's products should be engineered to be more compatible\nwith those of ICP. An alarm had gone off in Peter's head, but he\nhad quieted it, tolerating the fact that Matthew did not fathom\nhis desire to uphold Wallaby's proprietary-technology direction.\nIn the long run, that's what it all boiled down to. Matthew\nwanted to transform Wallaby into an ancillary concern, its\ncomputers acting as peripherals to ICP's machines, allowing ICP\nto remain as the number-one portable and desktop computer\nmanufacturer.\n\nHe felt exhausted and lifeless, disembodied, his foot heavy on\nthe gas pedal, drawn by gravity as he raced down the highway\npushing seventy-five miles per hour. Even the car was a fucking\nprop, Peter thought miserably. When Matthew had gotten one for\nhimself just like it, he had told Peter it was because he valued\nhis artistic appreciation for the machine, that he respected his\npassion for beautifully designed products. How many other little\ngames of pretend had there been, when all along Matthew had been\ntreating him like a child, playing him along and pacifying him\nuntil he could drop the ax?\n\nHis throat felt packed with cotton balls when the reality of what\nhad just happened started to sink in. His stomach turned and\nrolled in mini-heaves. All he wanted to do was to make smart\nportable computers that made everyone's life easier. Couldn't he\nbe allowed that simple pleasure? With this question, the weird\nfeeling in his heart stirred. It had been dormant all morning,\nand he had all but forgotten about it. But now it was awake, and\nthis time it felt a little different. A little larger, a little\nlivelier. A little more painful.\n\nAll of Peter's work on the new and improved Joey Plus was over.\nMatthew had taken away the thing that was more important to him\nthan anything else in the world. Peter could just picture it, how\nit would proceed from this day forward - Matthew marching into\nthe engineering group, armed with a complicated schedule and an\narmy of bozo project managers, all meant to scare the development\nteam into finishing the Joey Plus. Then of course he would\nre-introduce it and take all the credit for Peter's hard work and\nvision.\n\nHow? Peter wondered. How could Matthew, the person he had\nsanctioned to join him in creating something so exciting and\nimportant, do this?\n\n\"Simple,\" Peter said aloud, at last letting himself acknowledge\nthe underlying truth of the whole mess. \"He used me.\"\n\nYes, he'd been used. But for the last time. Enough was enough. As\nsoon as he got home, he would begin weeding from his life\neveryone who was using him.\n\nHis car phone jingled, and he punched it, knocking it to the\nfloor. No more talking. It was too late for that. He gripped the\nwheel more tightly and pressed down hard on the gas pedal, eager\nto get home and begin undoing his mistakes, ditching the bad\nparts, nurturing the good parts. It would be just that easy.\n\nHe would start with Ivy.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\"I think he answered, but then he hung up,\" Eileen said, holding\nthe telephone to her ear.\n\n\"Forget it,\" Matthew told his secretary. He closed his office\ndoor and seated himself before his computer. He closed his eyes\nlet out an exhausted sigh. Leave it alone, he told himself. Leave\nhim alone, you can't get through to him, can't make him\nunderstand. It has to be this way. There is no other way.\n\nHis plan had worked. The executive staff and board of directors\nhad faith in him to run the company after all. Peter could no\nlonger stand in the way of his taking control of Wallaby. Now he\nwas free to build momentum and power as he moved into the next\nphase of his plan. He felt a dizzying rush of elation as he fully\ncomprehended what he'd just done. Though he had sincerely cared\nfor Peter when they'd first met, after awhile he had grown less\nenchanted as he was reminded that falling for the young inventor\nwould prevent him from ever achieving his real goal at Wallaby.\nHe wholeheartedly wished things could have turned out\ndifferently. But they had not. And it was over. He only wished\nPeter had tried harder to understand the real reason everyone in\nthe boardroom had voted against him, even though they themselves\nhad not yet admitted it. He had known all along that Peter would\nnot simply bow out gracefully and accept a non-management role in\nthe company. If only he had been more receptive to the idea of\nconnecting to ICP's computers, this would have never happened.\nThere was no room for being sentimental now, he told himself. Why\nrevisit the past? But as Matthew rested his eyes, he allowed his\nmind to wander back anyway, letting the memory of those\nintoxicating early days deepen the resonance of his most recent\ntriumph.\n\n\nThe airplane banked left, changing its coastal orientation, and\nrose through the hazy grayness surrounding JFK Airport.\nDestination: San Jose, California.\n\nWhen the seat belt sign blinked off, Matthew eased his seat back\ninto a more comfortable position. Sunlight broke through the\ngrayness and the cabin was filled with sunlight as the plane\nclimbed.\n\n\"Good morning,\" a stewardess said. \"Can I bring you a glass of\norange juice? Champagne?\"\n\n\"I'd like Orange Fresh, please,\" Matthew said. He was certain the\nairline carried the soft drink-it had, after all, been his idea\nto test-market the all-natural citrus beverage with this very\ncarrier before it was introduced by International Foods several\nyears ago.\n\nThe stewardess returned with a glass of the sparkling orange\nbeverage. She placed a napkin on the tray and then set the drink\nupon it.\n\n\"Do many people drink Orange Fresh?\" he asked.\n\n\"It's one of our most-requested soft drinks. Though most folks\ndon't keep it all that soft,\" she said with a wink.\n\nHe felt a burst of pride and love for Greta. Thanks to her,\nOrange Fresh had carved a new and highly profitable market niche\nthat had earned Matthew kudos from the company's executives.\nThough International Foods' marketing of the all-natural\nrefreshment (\"Good for you, and fun to drink!\") had created a\nmarkedly successful soft drink, a second, unexpected market had\nblossomed, thanks to Greta - the Sassy Screw. One part vodka, two\nparts Orange Fresh. The healthy soda had instantly become a\npopular cocktail mixer, displacing Mother Nature's own natural\ncontender, orange juice. In its first month of sales, the product\nreached the magic 50 million-case mark, and the company threw a\nyacht party for Matthew. That day, however, had ended in tragedy.\nAnd now, as he flew to California, he hoped that maybe, if he\nlanded this job, the loss that he and Greta had suffered that day\nmight be amended.\n\nFinishing the beverage, he made room for the materials he had\nreceived from the headhunter who had contacted him two weeks\nearlier, expressing Wallaby's interest in him. He pulled his\nbriefcase from beneath the seat in front of him and opened it on\nthe vacant seat beside him. The over-stuffed folder inside\ncontained newspaper clippings, annual reports, and magazine\narticle reprints, as well as a brochure of Wallaby's computer,\nthe Mate.\n\nAlthough Matthew knew of Peter Jones - who in the Fortune 500\ndidn't? - and the highly publicized invention Jones created in\nhis bedroom while a senior in high school, he became more and\nmore intrigued as he browsed through the clippings.\n\nA cover story in \"Time\" two years earlier touted Jones as\n\"Silicon Valley's Hottest Kid On The Block.\"\n\n\"Forbes\" magazine listed Jones in its directory of America's\nrichest people. An accompanying article detailed Wallaby's\nphenomenal growth and financial milestones, ranking it the\nfastest-growing company in America. When Wallaby had gone public\nfive years ago, Jones's total worth was estimated at more than\n250 million dollars, with Wallaby reporting annual sales of just\nover 600 million. Holding the second largest share of Wallaby\nstock was Hank Towers, who was estimated to be worth close to 200\nmillion dollars. A five-year-old \"Fortune\" article told the story\nof how Towers was the man Jones first approached for start-up\ncash with his hackneyed portable computer design. At the time,\nTowers had owned a small company that built highly-specialized\ncomputers that were ruggedized for field and medical\napplications. Towers had invited Jones to visit him at his\noffices after seeing the invention, the first truly all-in-one\nportable computer, at a science fair. Towers, unlike some of the\nothers to whom Peter had shown the product, hadn't balked at its\nradical design, nor had he laughed when Jones explained his\nvision for manufacturing the computer at very low cost so that\nmillions of people could have their own portable personal\ncomputer to take with them wherever they went. Not long after\ntheir initial visit, Towers gave Jones a check for 200 thousand\ndollars. The rest was history.\n\nAnother \"Fortune\" story was the first among several of the more\nrecent articles to raise in Matthew a curious caution. According\nto Nicholas Whitley, a science teacher at Sunnyvale High School,\n\"Jones was a rebel. He never wanted to participate in what the\nrest of the class was focused on. He wanted to do everything\nhimself, on his own.\" Whitley admitted, however, that had Jones\nbeen like the rest of the kids, Sunnyvale High would never have\nbecome, thanks to its simple all-in-one design, one of the\nbiggest education customers of the Mate computer - or any\ncomputer, for that matter. His main concern was Jones's\nleadership skills: \"I wonder about Wallaby's long-term success.\nHe's a bright kid, with a knack for divining opportunity, but as\na company grows, I'm wondering if he'll be able to handle it.\"\n\nA month-old \"Business Week\" article crystallized Matthew's\ncaution. A profile on Jones commented on his biting rivalry with\nICP, the world's largest computer manufacturer. When Jones was\nqueried about whether Wallaby was developing communications\nfeatures in their products that would make them more compatible\nwith ICP's mainframe, desktop, and portable computers, he had\nreplied adamantly, \"Never. We do it our own way. Though I would\nconsider letting them license our operating system and hardware\ndesigns.\" It was that interminable audacity that raised many\neyebrows about the future of Wallaby. When Matthew considered\nICP's size, more than fifty billion dollars in sales, and the\nfact that its computers were used for almost every aspect of\nworldwide systemization in one way or another, a red flag\nunfurled in his mind. Matthew feared that he was probably wasting\nhis time speaking to Jones about becoming the company's earnestly\nsought president. At the same time, though, the lure of being in\na position to influence the future technology tools used by\npeople all around the world aroused his interest. Perhaps Jones\nwas working on something new and more powerful than ICP's own\ndesktop and portable computers, which had quickly overtaken and\nthen dwarfed Wallaby's market share. Many speculated that that\nwas the case. Jones, however, had remained tight-lipped over the\npast year and would talk to no one about what he was working on.\nIf the speculation was true and he got in there now, while they\nstill had a window of opportunity, perhaps he could help Jones\nbuild a strategy that would firmly seat Wallaby as the portable\ncomputer technology and market leader, with a perpetual lead over\nICP.\n\nHe loosened his tie and pushed the seat to the fully reclined\nposition. The stewardess asked him which entree he had selected\nfrom the lunch menu, and he said he was going to pass on the meal\nand nap until they arrived.\n\nHe had gotten little sleep over the few nights prior to his trip\nto Wallaby. Two nights earlier, after work, he had gone to a\nlocal computer dealer and purchased an Wallaby Mate computer. He\nhad worked with the machine until two o'clock in the morning.\nThough he read the manuals and stepped through the tutorial\nprograms packaged with it, he found the computer difficult to\nuse, and that made him wonder how long it would take before\nWallaby's sales began to dwindle even further; its last-quarter\nnumbers had slipped from those of the preceding quarter.\nFurthermore, for a portable computer it was considerably heavier,\nbigger, and shorter-lived in the battery department than ICP's\nand other, smaller companies' portable computers. Although\nschools preferred the system because of its rich library of\neducation programs, the market for the Mate was closing fast. If\nWallaby wanted to be successful in the future it would have to\nbring something radically new to the table, something so\ncompelling people just had to have it.\n\nThe Joey came close to fulfilling that tall order, but not close\nenough. But it would, soon enough. It was Matthew's plan to make\nWallaby more compatible with ICP's computers. If only Peter had\nagreed, things would have worked out better, and he would not\nhave had to unseat the young man from the company's top position.\n\nAs he loaded Joey's e-mail program, any pain he had felt at the\nloss of his friendship with Peter was almost fully entombed now.\nWith e-mail, Matthew had been able to communicate with his secret\npartner in Manhattan for the past two years, and he had been\nlooking forward to this day, to sending this message, for a long\ntime now.\n\nHe typed:\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nTO: wharrell@icp.com\nFROM: mlocke@wallaby.com\nSUBJECT: STATUS\n\nToday I was granted full support by the board of directors and\nexecutive staff to take over all senior management\nresponsibilities at Wallaby, including the development of the\nJoey Plus computer, which will be complete and ready for release\nin three months.\n\nI attempted to persuade Peter Jones to accept a position within\nthe company to oversee the development of our future products,\nbut my sense is he will not accept.\n\nWe will succeed regardless.\n\n--Matthew\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\n\nHe tapped the Send button, and a flashing message appeared\nindicating that the e-mail was being transmitted.\n\nJust then, his office door opened and he spun in his seat. It was\nLaurence Maupin.\n\n\"Hello, Matthew. How are you holding up?\"\n\nMatthew leaned back in his seat, blocking the computer screen\nwith his upper body. \"I think I'm still in shock,\" he said\nwearily, wiping his sleeve across his brow.\n\n\"Your statement's out to the press,\" she said, giving the folder\nin her hand a little shake. She looked at him with a genuinely\nconcerned expression. \"Why don't you take the rest of the day\noff?\"\n\n\"I think I will,\" he said, and offered her a grateful smile. He\nturned and shut off the computer, noticing before the screen went\nblack that his message had been successfully sent.\n\n\"Good. We can catch up later,\" she said, touching his arm\nlightly.\n\nHe gathered his notes and briefcase. Exiting the building, he\nfelt euphoric yet depleted, as if he'd just run a marathon. And\nhe had won. The race was finished, and he had emerged victorious.\nHis biggest obstacle had been overcome.\n\nUnlocking his car door, he was struck by a sudden realization,\nand he let out a small laugh at the irony of his new position.\nHe'd really done it. He'd really made it. And farther than he had\never imagined. To think that soda and crackers were his business\njust a few short years ago. It was incredible. Indeed, although\nhe would not become the chairman of the largest food company in\nthe world, as he had once dreamed, today's accomplishment set him\nup for an even greater eventual success - chairman of the largest\ncomputer company in the world.\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n\nOpening the front door of his home, Peter was suddenly assaulted\nby a strange blaring voice and shouts of laughter. The cacophony\ngrew louder and more vexing as he neared the computer lab.\n\nCharging into the room he found Ivy sitting cross-legged on the\nfloor and holding a joint to her lips. Her enraptured smile\nwavered when she registered Peter's expression.\n\nTwo other young people, both boys, were also in the room, both\nseemingly oblivious to Peter's arrival. One of the boys held a\nmicrophone with a thin cable that ran into a small black box,\nwhich was in turn attached to a Joey. The computer and a color\nmonitor rested on a table in the center of the room, which was\nlittered with beer cans, bottles, and junk food packages. On the\nmonitor was a bright yellow smiley face, and as the boy spoke\ninto the microphone the smiley face became animated and\nresponded.\n\n\"Say cheese,\" the boy said.\n\n\"Say cheese,\" the smiley face replied, but with an unreal robotic\ntone rather than a natural human-sounding tone. Simultaneously,\nthe words \"Say cheese\" appeared in a little balloon, like in a\ncartoon strip, beside the smiley face's mouth. Nicknamed \"Myna\nBird,\" the program, which Ivy had designed, was a crude\ndemonstration of speech recognition and synthesis, which enabled\nthe Joey to hear and speak plain English words. The microphone\nfed the sounds directly into the converter box and through the\nJoey, which interpreted them into actual text and spoken words,\nbased on a library of words it had already learned.\n\n\"Goo goo,\" the boy said.\n\nThe smiley face did not reply.\n\n\"I said, `goo goo,'\" the boy said again, breaking into gales of\nlaughter.\n\n\"I said,\" the smiley face said, unfamiliar with the rest of the\nsentence.\n\n\"I said `goo' fucking `goo'!\" the boy shouted.\n\n\"I said...fucking,\" the smiley face said.\n\nThe boy chuckled a trippy chuckle and glanced at the others  -\nand saw that none were laughing. He turned around and saw Peter.\nBusted.\n\n\"What the fuck is going on?\" Peter said loudly.\n\n\"What the fuck is going on?\" the smiley face mimicked, deadpan,\nminus the fury.\n\nThe others guiltily bowed their heads, mindful of Peter's\npalpable anger - all except for Ivy who, turning to avoid looking\nat Peter directly, rubbed her nose to stifle a small giggle. In\nher attempt to contain her mirth, the situation worsened and her\ncheeks puffed and she burst out laughing.\n\nPeter approached her with his hands on his hips.\n\n\"What's so fucking funny?\"\n\nThe boy holding the microphone quickly switched it off, before\nthe smiley face could say anymore.\n\n\"You are,\" Ivy said, bringing her knuckles to her face,\nsputtering out more giggles. \"You are, love.\"\n\nThe boys chuckled nervously, like maybe this wasn't so bad after\nall.\n\nAt the sound of the sharp slap, all laughter ceased.\n\nPeter stood there, eyes blazing at her, his hand still raised in\nthe air.\n\nWith a vacant expression, Ivy absently brushed her cheek and\ntried to focus her vision on him.\n\n\"Get out,\" he said, turning to the others.\n\nIvy remained seated on the floor, stroking her face while the\nboys disconnected the equipment from the Joey and gathered their\nknapsacks.\n\n\"You can keep the beer, man,\" one of the boys said as he\nshouldered his pack. Then the pair was gone.\n\nAlice padded softly into the room and began picking up the\nscattered litter. She stepped on an empty potato chip bag, which\ncrackled noisily underfoot. Peter could see that it was an\nInternational Foods brand, one of Matthew's onetime goodies. Too\nbad he hadn't stayed in fucking soda pop. Any temporary remorse\nPeter felt for his behavior, for slapping Ivy, vanished, and his\nrage returned with greater force.\n\n\"Leave it, Alice. Ivy will clean up.\"\n\nThe housekeeper hesitated then returned the empty bottles to the\ntable, her face flushed as she soundlessly exited the room.\n\nPeter turned and faced Ivy from where he now stood, across the\nroom.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said, still sitting on the floor and now rocking\nback and forth with her arms wrapped around herself. \"We were\nworking on my program, and I wanted to surprise you tonight with\na new dialect module I put together - \"\n\n\"You have to go.\"\n\n\" - and I wanted to demonstrate it when you walked in, so you\nwould be happy.\"\n\n\"I said leave.\"\n\nTears were dropping from her chin and she remained seated on the\nfloor in a trance-like state. His eyes settled on the Joey's\nsilent glowing screen, the smiley face staring at him with its\nstupid knowing grin. His jaw quaked as he fought back his hurt,\nhis longing to run to her and have her hold him, to apologize and\ntell her about everything that had happened. He was torn.\n\nNo, not her.\n\nRegardless of what had happened last night, he needed Kate. Not\nthis girl, who, he reminded himself, like everyone else, was\nusing him.\n\n\"Get out!\" he shouted.\n\n\"But I love you!\"\n\n\"No!\" He turned and raised his hands to his head to subdue the\npounding that was growing angrier the longer he stayed in this\npolluted room. \"You used me. You even stole my clothes.\"\n\n\"I'm in love with you. Peter, please. I almost died when I heard\nyou were coming to speak at the commencement. I had to sneak into\nthe reception, just so I could see you. And then when I met you\nand you invited me here, I knew it was because you felt it too,\nthe way we connected when we saw each other.\" She came from\nbehind him and attempted to take him in her arms.\n\n\"Don't touch me,\" he said, shaking her off. He crossed the room\nand positioned himself on the other side, a chaise lounge between\nthem.\n\nShe stayed where she was, hands at her sides and face all red and\npuffy. \"Peter, I need you. I've changed my life because of you.\"\n\nHe looked in her direction, but his eyes were unseeing. \"If you\ndon't get out of here right now with everything that's yours,\nI'll carry you outside myself and throw you down the hill.\" His\nface was unmoving and placid, almost like the smiley face.\n\nShe took a step toward him, her hands twisting together,\npleading. \"But last night. Peter. What about last night?\"\n\nHe closed his eyes and clamped his jaw. Nothing.\n\n\"Fuck you, then,\" she spat. But she made no motion to leave.\nInstead, she crossed her arms over her breasts and stood there. A\nsound that was both a laugh and a cry burst from her lips. \"Don't\nyou see? I did this for you, because I care about Joey, and you.\nWhy don't you want to believe that. That's why I changed my\nstudies, because I knew this was something important.\" She\nsmacked the monitor. \"You know you care about it.\" She pointed at\nhim accusingly. \"You said so yesterday, when I showed you how far\nI'd come.\" She made a disgusted face. She fought to hold back her\ntears. \"But you don't give a damn. Not about anyone but\nyourself.\"\n\nHe did not respond. As she collected her things, his attention\nremained fixed on the computer's screen. He heard her climb the\nstairs and enter the guest room. There were sounds of drawers\nopening, the closet door sliding on its tracks. A few minutes\nlater she came downstairs. He did not look at her.\n\nShe crossed the room and ejected a floppy diskette from the Joey,\nand picked up a box of floppies sitting on the table. She placed\nthe items in her knapsack, hoisted the bag onto her shoulder, and\ncollected her small duffel bag at the doorway. Straightening\nherself for a moment with her back to him, she spoke. \"You're\ngonna regret you did this, Peter.\" Then she was gone.\n\nHe sat down and glared at the smiley face. It returned his gaze,\npassive, obedient, waiting for input. Just like everyone else, he\nthought morosely, it wanted something from him.\n\nAt his side he felt the neck of a bottle protruding from between\nthe sofa cushions. He lifted it. A nearly empty bottle of wine.\nRed wine.\n\nAnd then it hit him. The bottle was the special Cabernet\nSauvignon Kate had given him on their first date, which they had\nvowed to drink together when Wallaby turned ten years old.\n\n\"No!\" he cried, and hurled the empty bottle at the evil smiley\nface with its leering, shit-eating grin.\n\nThe monitor exploded in sparks and smoke, the smiley face gone\nforever, and the room fell into silence and he was all alone.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\"Greta?\" Matthew called, stepping from room to room on the lower\nfloor of the house. He climbed the stairs. Soft, pleasant music\ndrifted out from the bedroom. He closed in on the bathroom, and\nfound his wife in the tub. She raised her face from some sort of\npicture book or atlas propped on a silver bath tray table.\n\nHe lowered himself to the closed toilet seat. \"It's over,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Thank God,\" Greta said. She closed her eyes and stretched her\nright arm out of the tub. Bubbles and soapy water dripped from\nher perfect hand onto the floor. \"Darling, would you pass me the\noil please?\"\n\nHe handed her a bottle of spiced bath oil. She held it there, out\nof the tub, until she caught his eye. She led his vision to the\nbottle's cap and he uncapped it and held it while she squeezed\nthe red liquid into the water. It spurted from the bottle and he\nwas suddenly mesmerized by the mixture as it bled into the water.\nHe studied his wife with sullen fascination as she lay there with\nher eyes closed, gently oscillating her shoulders and legs,\nmixing up the oil and water. With her eyes still closed, she held\nout the bottle to him again. Accepting it, his hand touched hers\nfor an instant. He shivered, and felt a sudden need to urinate.\nHe could not remember the last time he had seen her other hand\nnaked, which was presently hidden somewhere under the water in\nthe tub. Nor could he remember the last time they had made love,\nthough he was pretty certain it was the evening before\nInternational Foods had thrown the yacht party for him to\ncelebrate the success of Orange Fresh. Thinking of these things,\nhe was momentarily hypnotized by the sight of her there in the\ntub, moving in the frothy pink water. His mind roared with the\nhorrific image of her as she had appeared when the accident had\noccurred. Underwater. Stillness. Then her eyes bulging as her\nhead splashed up out of the sea's redness. The screaming. The\nflailing. The blood. Splashing -\n\nShe was flicking bath water at him. \"Matthew, are you here? I\nsaid I'm happy for you. Did everything work out okay?\"\n\n\"Yes. Yes,\" he said, blinking. A few droplets had landed on his\ntrousers. He brushed them away and said, \"He's gone. It's over.\nThey all chose me over Peter.\"\n\n\"There,\" she said, \"you see. I told you everything would work out\njust fine.\"\n\nHe thought about how she saw things. A few months ago, when he\nhad felt doubt, she had helped him regain his focus and set the\nstage for today's meeting. Her persistent belief in him had\nfinally won out, and ultimately he had believed in himself enough\nto begin the painstaking maneuvers necessary to topple Jones\nafter he'd balked at Matthew's suggestion to make the Joey more\ncompatible with ICP's computers. That, he understood now, was\nwhen it must have happened, when he had begun to live in his\nwife's presence without really noticing her anymore, focusing\nwholly on his work. The first stage of detachment had been after\nthe accident. The second was after he had gotten his plan\nunderway. He had finally and completely shut her out, without\never really meaning to. In both cases he had told himself that it\nwas temporary, that things would eventually return to the way\nthey had been. But now he understood that those times would never\nreturn. They couldn't, for it seemed all was lost on that day of\nthe accident. He thought of the object - that was precisely how\nhe thought of it, an object of his lost affection - which he kept\nhidden in the inside pocket of his briefcase. Lost. What was he\ngoing to do? How would he end up? How would they end up? He knew\nwhat she was thinking, what her own hopes were. That now that\nPeter Jones was out of the way, he'd spend more time with her.\n\nTurning his wedding band round and round on his finger in his\nlap, hidden from her sight, he spoke. \"This is just the\nbeginning, honey,\" he said, cautious. \"Now, slowly and carefully,\nI have to reveal my plan for engineering our products to connect\nwith ICP's systems to the board and executive staff so that they\nbelieve I'm doing it to increase sales and market share.\" He\nwatched her expression.\n\nSponging her neck, she said, \"Well darling, now that that pest is\nout of your way, I'm sure you'll have no problem.\" There was an\nedge of warning in her delivery.\n\n\"Yes,\" he paused. \"But there are many people in the company who\nstill carry Peter's belief that ICP is bad and that Wallaby\nshould concentrate on competing more firmly rather than yield to\nthem.\"\n\n\"Darling, you've come this far, and you'll make it to the\nglorious end of your plan just fine. I just know it. Have you\ncontacted William yet?\"\n\n\"I sent him a message,\" Matthew said. He realized that he needed\nto check to see if William had received the memo and replied to\nit. His concern asserted itself. \"William's not going to be\npleased. He wanted me to exhaust every possibility to keep Peter\nonboard. But after seeing the way he reacted I doubt he'll stick\naround.\" Matthew stood. He had to use the toilet...but rather\nthan use this one he wanted to use the one downstairs. \"I better\ngo check my e-mail,\" he said, excusing himself.\n\nHe hurried downstairs to his library office. He turned on his\ncomputer and hung his jacket over the chair. His Joey was\noutfitted with every add-on option, including a color monitor, a\nCD-ROM drive, a laser printer, and a mouse. Seeing the mouse\nlying there, he abruptly remembered Laurence and the thoughts\nhe'd had of her yesterday in his car; he recalled too the image\nof her lovely hand clutching the manila folder less than an hour\nago in his office. While the computer started up, he went into\nthe library's small toilet. He stood before the toilet and opened\nhis fly. At the same time he closed his eyes, concentrating.\nThere came no flow. Instead, he felt himself hardening in his own\nhand. He locked the door, dropped his trousers to the floor, and\nseated himself. At the age of ten, Matthew Locke had had the good\nfortune of discovering masturbation. It had altered the course of\nhis life forever. For whenever he became distracted from his\nstudies, thinking about girls instead of geometry, he had simply\nrelieved himself. It was to this dedication that he owed his\nsuccess. It had enabled him to focus all of his energies on\nimportant things. He had achieved autonomous coupling - a boy and\nhis hand. Even in college he favored this method. Of course there\nhad been girls, but none of them ever proved worth the time or\neffort. Though this was the price he paid in order to come so far\nso fast, he had never seemed to fully grasp its relevance until\nthe day he'd met Greta. The instant he'd laid eyes on her, her\nhands, he determined it was time to think about marrying. It was\nimportant to his career, and if he was going to do it, then why\nnot with a woman who's hands were more alluring than his own?\n\nWere.\n\nBut hers were not the hands he thought of now, holding him,\nstroking him. No, the hand he imagined in place of his own\nbelonged to another woman, a girl, really, who he told himself he\nmust resist.\n\nHe came, and she went.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nIt was one o'clock in the afternoon, and Peter was in bed.\n\nHe lay there staring at the ceiling. Time didn't matter anymore.\nEvery now and then he took a gulp of Scotch from the bottle he\nhad opened after Ivy left. Normally he never drank hard liquor.\nBut today it seemed like the most natural thing to do. He needed\nsomething to help him escape from his own mind, something that\nwould inevitably force him into sleep, where he could hide, even\nif just for a couple of hours, from his dilemma. It was too soon\nto try and think things through. Through? How, he wondered, does\none think through being through? With every swallow from the\nbottle the reality of it all slipped a little farther away.\n\nWhat he wanted to know was, what would they do for the future?\nHis instinctive reaction to anything that threatened Wallaby - in\nthis case, his being flung from the company - provoked fear and\nanxiety for its future, beyond the potential misery of his\npersonal fate.\n\nHe had given nearly ten years of his life to Wallaby. The time\nwhen it all began seemed like a lifetime ago.\n\nHe drifted.\n\n\nNever socializing with the jocks, pot-heads, or any other group,\nPeter Jones was considered an oddball student. He had been an\norphan most of his life, living in a Los Gatos home governed by\nan elderly couple. He was used to spending time alone, reading or\ngoing for walks in the nearby woods, imagining he was Henry David\nThoreau, observing nature, lost in his own thoughts. Whenever he\nwas forced to spend a few trial days with potential foster\nparents, he affected a sullen and despondent mood, saving a\ntantrum or explosive outburst for the last day of the test\nperiod. He had gotten by just fine on his own, and he didn't need\nanyone, or anything, except maybe his science fiction novels.\n\nClayton and Clara Dodson, the owners of the orphanage, had had\ntheir hands full with Peter. Eventually they stopped sending him\noff to potential homes. The youngster pretty much took care of\nhimself and was always willing to help out around the orphanage.\nOne day the Dodsons's acceptance of Peter went from resigned to\ndelighted when he burst into the house and told them he had\ninvented the world's first truly portable computer. Peter had\nrecently begun to hang around with the \"gear heads,\" students who\nwere involved in clubs fostering fans of rockets, automobile\nengines, and electronics. At the club meetings he met several\nkids like himself - bright, introverted; some of them would\neventually become his first employees at Wallaby, right out of\nhigh school. During his senior year, while checking out some of\nthe other student projects an hour before the science fair, Peter\nmet two gawky fellows who had built a device they called the\nAll-In-One Computer. The invention was primitive at best, but all\nthe right parts were there: keyboard, screen, disk drive.\nCaptivated, and without a project of his own, Peter persuaded the\nboys to include him in their project which, five minutes before\nthe show began, he renamed the Portable Personal Computer.\n\nThe project won first prize, and after the show an older\ngentleman named Mr. Towers introduced himself. He told the boys\nthat they were on to something and that they should give him a\ncall sometime if they advanced the design of the box. Peter\nshoved the man's business card in his pocket.\n\nPeter became more and more intrigued with the concept of a\ncomputer you could take with you wherever you went. Theirs came\nclose, but it required a wall socket to power it so the only\nplace you could really take it was from room to room. During the\nsummer after his high school graduation he reread all of his\nscience fiction books featuring robots and computers as their\nmain characters. In his mind's eye he fashioned a small computer\nthat could be his friend, like the ones in the books. He imagined\ntaking his computer with him for walks in the woods, telling the\ncomputer about the things he saw, and what he thought. His\ncomputer would keep these things in its memory, and the more it\nlearned about him and the world, the more loyal and dependable a\nfriend it would become. He would make a lot of them,\ninexpensively, so that everyone could afford one and use it for\nwhatever they wanted. He envisioned the computer and how it would\nwork, how people would approach it and work with it. When he felt\nhe had realized the computer as clearly as if he already owned\none, he sat down to start designing. But when he picked up his\npen, he could do little more than sketch crude boxes with screens\nand keyboards. He realized that he didn't know how to design the\ncircuits and parts necessary to actually fabricate the machine.\nHe called the two boys from the science fair, Paul Trueblood and\nRick Boardman, and invited them over to the orphanage one\nafternoon. When he described his idea, the boys grew excited.\nPushing his eyeglasses up on his nose, Paul began rambling about\nhow he could do the hardware part, maybe even squeeze in a modem\nfor calling up other computers, and Rick described how he could\nwrite a integrated program for the computer so that it could do\nreal work for people, like keep track of important names and\naddresses, right out of the box.\n\nThree months later the three boys stood in front of their first\nprototype, the Mate, and ran their first program, an all-in-one\norganizer and word processor and communications program that they\ndubbed Easy Does It.\n\nWhen the Mates development was well underway, Peter contacted Mr.\nTowers, the man he had met a few months before at the science\nfair. Towers invited him to his nearby office. Two hours later,\nTowers had become the primary investor in the Mate's development,\nand overseer of the startup of a new company.\n\nWithin a year the boys were building as many computers as they\ncould in Peter's garage. Towers remained in the background,\nworking deals with parts suppliers through his electronic\ninstrument company to provide the boys with what they needed for\nproduction. Eventually they had so many orders that they had to\nrelocate to real offices in nearby Sunnyvale. Peter moved out of\nthe orphanage and created a minimal living space for himself in\none of the building's corner offices. Together, Hank Towers and\nPeter, then twenty-two, founded their new company, which Peter\nnamed Wallaby, which everyone knew was an animal that had a\npocket in which it carried its joey...the little friend that\nPeter had always dreamed of having, and knew someday he would\ncreate.\n\n\nHe snapped awake to a high-pitched warble. The telephone.\nReaching for it, he knocked over the bottle of Scotch, spilling\nits contents onto the hardwood floor.\n\n\"Hello?\" The voice on the other end was anxious.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Peter said, pressing his fingers to his eyelids.\n\n\"Peter? Are you all right? Petey?\"\n\n\"Kate.\" This came out as a moan.\n\nShe spoke very fast. \"What's happened? I caught the tail end of\nsomething about Wallaby on the CNN, something about a\nreorganization, and called your office, Peter, and they said they\nhad not seen you. Peggy put me on hold and called the boardroom\nand they told her you had bolted and that something happened but\nshe wouldn't tell me what. What the hell is going on?\"\n\n\"It's over,\" he slurred.\n\n\"What's over?\"\n\n\"Me. Wallaby. Everything.\"\n\n\"Petey, talk to me. Are you there? Petey?\"\n\n\"I've been fired. From my own company.\"\n\n\"I can hardly hear you. I don't understand. What do you mean\nfired?\"\n\n\"Fired,\" he shouted, and immediately regretted it. The sting in\nhis head and heart diverged, spread. As if on cue, the secret\nthing in his heart asserted itself again. With its arrival, an\nabstraction formed in his drunken mind. He thought of the word\n\"mate.\" It represented the start of his life. Because of the\nMate, he had met Kate. She was his soul mate, and with her he had\nexperienced his coming of age. And wasn't she, in some ways, the\ninspiration behind the Joey? Wasn't their nomadic relationship\nwhat had inspired him to design a computer you could take with\nyou when you went away? Now it had been taken from him. How long,\nhe wondered, before Kate was gone too? The more aware he was of\nthis feeling, of losing the things close to his heart, the more\naware he became of his newest mate, the disagreeable feeling that\nhad burrowed inside him. At this moment it was troubled, like a\ntiny caged creature suffering from hunger spasms, nourishment\nlying within its line of sight, in its owner's hand, beyond its\nreach, so close, yet so far away.\n\nKate shouted his name into the phone, breaking him out of his\nstupor. \"Tell me what happened.\"\n\n\"Matthew's in control. They want me to sit in an office. Be a\nthinker.\" He became outraged by his own account. \"A fucking\nthinker.\"\n\n\"Then you're not fired, right, Peter. Then you're not fired?\"\n\n\"Good as. Nothin' left for me to do there.\"\n\n\"Baby, I'm in LA at the studio. I'm leaving right now. I'll be\nthere as fast as I can. No more than a couple hours.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" he said softly.\n\n\"I love you.\"\n\n\"You too.\" Chest pains. He hung up the phone and picked up the\nbottle.\n\n\"It was the Scotch,\" he said to the empty room, then uttered a\npainful chuckle that bordered on hysteria and threatened to\novertake him if he didn't get a grip. He busied himself looking\nfor the bottle's cap, but saw that he wouldn't need it. The\nbottle was empty.\n\nAnd so was he.\n\nWallaby. Kate. These things came to a man only once in his\nlifetime. Had become his lifetime. Once you've lost them, he\nreckoned as he began to drift off to sleep, you never again get,\nor deserve, anything as good.\n\nTeetering on the edge of consciousness, he struggled to remember\nthe lyrics of an old song he used to listen to, something about\nyou can't always get what you want, but if you cry sometimes, you\nget what you need.\n\nNot quite, but close enough.\n\nAnd so he cried.\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n\nWilliam Harrell's meeting with his advisers had been taxing. Both\nhad recommended that ICP begin the accelerated development of the\nprototype BPX ultra-portable computer - a product, were William\nto give its development the go-ahead, that they felt could\ncompete directly with the advanced features of Wallaby's Joey.\nAnd, his technology adviser stressed, the BPX wouldn't suffer\nfrom the problem that currently plagued the Joey, of too few\navailable third-party software applications. ICP's magnitude\ncould garner pre-announcement commitment from software\ndevelopers, said the adviser, to begin creating BPX programs for\nthe computer immediately.\n\nIf he hadn't had his secret plan in place, William would have\nbeen mad not to heed his advisers' advice and implement exactly\nwhat they had presented. But he'd had it all figured out for a\nlong time. What he wanted now, more than anything, was for them\nto leave his office so that he could go home and check his\ne-mail.\n\nWhen he uttered his response, \"We'll continue evolving the\ncurrent BP design,\" he could see in their expressions that they\nthought he was crazy. Both stared at him with incredulity. His\nbusiness adviser flapped pages of figures and charts that\nprojected the market penetration Wallaby could achieve if it were\nsuccessful in getting the rumored Joey Plus computer to market\nwithin three months. According to one chart, Wallaby could begin\nby tapping some of ICP's largest customer accounts, which could\nlead to sizable market penetration over the next three years.\nWithin five years, another chart predicted, the Joey Plus's\nsuperior design could earn half of ICP's portable computer market\nshare for Wallaby.\n\nWilliam held firmly to his decision. What they were telling him\nwas precisely what he and his secret partner, Matthew Locke,\nalready knew. What his advisers didn't know was that their fears\nof Wallaby gaining monumental market share would hardly be a\nworry to ICP in the not-too-distant future. On the contrary, it\nwould be cause for celebration.\n\nReturning to his palatial home, he proceeded straight to his\nimpressive office. He exhaled an appreciative sigh as he powered\non his Wallaby Joey and sat before it, quite literally on the\nedge of his seat. Matthew had sent William the computer when it\nwas introduced last year. They had made arrangements before\nMatthew had moved to California as to how they would communicate\nthe progress of their secret merger plan, which the men had\noriginally formulated here in William's home. It would stun the\nbusiness world, William reflected for the hundredth time. He'd\nexperienced so many moments of pleasant anticipation since the\ncourse had been set two years ago.\n\n\nAfter the jolting squash match with Rolland Worthy, William had\nreturned to his office and had his secretary cancel his remaining\nmeetings. He asked his driver to take him to Central Park. He\nintended to force himself to relax and think through the possible\neffects that Worthy's news could have on ICP's future portable\ncomputer strategy. During the short trip, William watched the\nminiature television in the passenger compartment, hopeful that\nthe commercials and nonsense soap opera dialogue would lighten\nhis frame of mind. Just before getting out of the car, he caught\na commercial that froze him in his seat for its duration. A\nnotion flashed in his mind. An instant later, the breadth of it\nnearly bowled him over in its force and irony, and he was\nthankful to be sitting down. The spark that ignited the idea was\nthe infamous Remington electric shaver commercial, in which\nVictor Kiam says, \"I liked the product so much, I bought the\ncompany.\" William's heart doubled its cadence, and wave after\nwave of adrenaline coursed through his system like gasoline\nspurting onto an open flame. His brain was a bonfire. Of course!\nThat was it! He would buy Wallaby, for the very same reason Kiam\nhad wanted Remington, because he really did like Wallaby's\nproduct so much. From his car phone he placed a call to Matthew\nLocke's office at International Foods. Matthew's secretary\ninformed him that Matthew was out of the office for two days, but\nsaid that she would have him call when he returned.\n\nIn his excitement he had forgotten what Rolland Worthy told him,\nthat Matthew was in California right now, visiting Wallaby.\n\nWilliam spent the next two days devising a plan. Rarely was there\nan occasion in which he had the pleasure of acting on impulse.\nEverything at ICP was planned several years in advance. The\njubilation he felt over the merger idea was no less than a gift\nfrom above - the first diversion to come along that was powerful\nenough to ease his grieving over the loss of his wife Martha, who\nhad passed away eight months ago, after a blessedly short battle\nwith pancreatic cancer.\n\nAfter losing Martha, William had secluded himself, inviting no\none into his home. His new idea would change all that. He sank\ninto his idea with pure obsession.\n\nMatthew Locke accepted William's dinner invitation after\nreturning from California. The two businessmen sat with drinks in\nthe library. Perfunctory conversation planted the seeds that they\ncarried to the dinner table. Once the first two courses were\ncompleted, William got the real discussion underway.\n\n\"As I told you on the phone, Rolland mentioned to me that you\nwere visiting Wallaby in California as a candidate for\npresident.\"\n\nMatthew had his own preface: \"Rolland has been my mentor at\nInternational Foods for more than ten years. I don't feel any ill\nwill toward him for telling you, as long as you respect the fact\nthat my trip was confidential.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" William said, and took a drink of water. Then he\nbegan. \"Matthew, an unusual feeling swept over me when I heard\nthis.\" Already his enthusiasm was quickening. \"I realized that\nWallaby must be up to something really big if they were calling\non someone of your caliber. It's been a long time since Peter\nJones has made any brash statements about us, the industry, or\nanything. Too long.\n\n\"I thought it would be interesting to meet you when you returned.\nYou see, a plan began to unfold in my mind, one that you may find\ninteresting.\" A smile lighted William's face, and he leaned\nforward a little. In a lowered voice he revealed the heart of the\nmatter: \"I've always had a strong admiration for Wallaby. But of\ncourse it's the sort of thing one must keep in check at ICP.\n\n\"Sure, we currently have a great portable computer. But we're not\ninnovative the way Wallaby is. And I suspect that they're up to\nsomething new. Something exciting.\"\n\nMatthew saw the purity of William's candor and honesty. His\nintuition was waking, and he was beginning to understand where\nthis conversation would take them. With this sureness, he offered\na teaser.\n\n\"I don't think I'm giving away any secrets by saying yes, you're\ncorrect. They're up to something. And yes, it is something very\nexciting.\"\n\nWilliam pushed his untouched plate aside. The two men shared a\nmoment of heavy silence, each considering his own tactics.\nMaintaining a hint of a smile, William was the first to make a\nmove. \"Matthew, I would like to suggest a possible business\narrangement.\"\n\nMatthew gave an agreeable nod.\n\n\"ICP is gigantic. Everything we do is planned many years into the\nfuture. Although our personal computers are outselling Wallaby's\nMate system, I suspect that whatever they have coming down the\npipeline will be completely unexpected and radical.\"\n\n\"Correct.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" William said. \"That's what I figured.\" He paused\nthoughtfully. When he spoke, his voice was casual and revealing,\nthe way a man's voice becomes when he is dead certain of the\nobject of his desire.\n\n\"I've always envied Peter Jones and his company. But of course\nI've got my own company to worry about. For my own entertainment,\nI've been looking for some time at Wallaby as a case study. I've\ntoyed with the idea of spinning out a rebellious group of\nengineers and forming a new subsidiary with the charter to build\nradical new portable computers. However, members of the board to\nwhom I've casually mentioned this have not responded positively.\nThey're focused on bigger systems and desktops, which, along with\nservice, account for most of our business. I must concede that I\nunderstand their lack of enthusiasm. We are an East Coast\ncompany. We're buttoned-down numbers people. Out west, they do\nthings differently. Profits follow passions.\"\n\nMatthew's eyes narrowed. \"I think I'm beginning to catch your\ndrift.\"\n\n \"I'll get to the point, then. Wallaby's products are not\ncompatible with our systems. Ours take a lot of time to learn how\nto use. Granted, Wallaby's Mate isn't a whole lot better, but\nthere's something about it that makes it friendlier, and it's\ncertainly easier to lug around.\"\n\n\"You ain't seen nothing yet,\" Matthew quipped.\n\n\"Right. So I'm not going to beat around the bush. I've got\nnothing to lose by sharing my fantasy with you.\" He took another\ngulp of water, then went for it. \"Matthew, I really like Wallaby.\nI think it has created, and will keep creating, exciting\ntechnologies. Peter Jones has an absolute vision of what small\ncomputers should be. We at ICP can't do that. We are a big\ncompany, with big computers.\" William's hands unfolded before\nhim. It was a gesture of offering. \"So what if Peter Jones and\nWallaby became a part of ICP, but were left alone in California\nto do their thing?\"\n\nMatthew was speechless.\n\n\"Say you, Matthew, were to go into Wallaby, the strong leader\nthat you are, and begin bending Jones and the company toward\nbecoming compatible with ICP's systems? Then, when the company is\noriented in a compatible direction, so that Wallaby's computers\ncan work with our big systems, ICP and Wallaby merge, but let\nWallaby maintain its freedom as an independently operated\nsubsidiary.\"\n\nMatthew's mind raced at the prospect of this outrageous coup. If\nit were successful, it could be bigger than anything he ever\ndreamed could happen at International Foods. He had a million\nquestions to ask, and his eagerness was written all over his\nface. But before he could utter a word, William raised his hands.\n\n\n\"Wait. Just one more thing to think about. For you it would\neventually mean the opportunity to move into the highest ranks of\nICP.\" In earnest, he said, \"My expiration date isn't too far off\ninto the future.\" There, William thought, he'd said his piece. He\nfelt himself relax a little. There was nothing more he could say.\nWhile respecting Matthew's silent deliberation, he stole a woeful\nglance at a portrait of his beloved Martha, smiling from where\nshe sat framed in silver on the antique china closet. I need\nthis, my dear, he said to her silently, I need to have this.\n\nHer sanction came out when Matthew spoke: \"It's brilliant.\"\n\nWilliam breathed a silent sigh.\n\nMatthew advanced his own view of the overall premise, and when he\nfinished he sat back and clasped his hands in his lap, his face\nglowing with certainty.\n\nAny concerns William might have had for Matthew's strategic\nability and comprehension now departed. \"Bravo,\" William said.\n\"Of course, there's much we'd have to discuss.\" Then, cautiously:\n\"And this plan must remain a secret between us. You and I will\nguide it along privately through its early stages, until we reach\nthe point where a merger makes perfect sense.\" He studied\nMatthew's expression for any sign of consternation, and was\npleased to find none.\n\n\"You know, its funny,\" Matthew said, with no hint of humor in his\nvoice, \"The big concern I've had about considering this job at\nWallaby was ICP. Now your big concern and my big concern may very\nwell wind up becoming the computer industry's single biggest\nconcern ever.\"\n\n\"Quite,\" said William, raising his glass to toast his new secret\npartner.\n\n\nThe touch-tone sound of the computer's modem brought William back\nto the present.\n\nAs planned, Matthew had sent him an e-mail message that validated\nthe decision he had voiced earlier to his advisers.\n\nHowever, when he read the last part of the message, about Peter\nJones's possible departure from the company, he felt a shiver.\nGranted, he was relieved now that Matthew had won support, and\nthat the secret merger plan could proceed. He favored a scenario\nwhereby Jones stayed with Wallaby and continued to lead the\ndevelopment of the company's future products.\n\nPondering this, he studied his finger on the Joey's trackpad.\nSliding his fingertip across the smooth surface felt natural and\nintuitive, a genius design. Peter Jones's genius design. Without\nthe trackpad, the Joey would not function as it did. Elegant.\nSilky. Smooth. Right.\n\nStaring at the small flat black space beneath his finger, a dark\nthought prodded his sense of certainty. Without Peter Jones,\ncould Wallaby operate as smoothly and naturally as a peripheral\nof ICP?\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nPeter blinked awake in the room's gauzy afternoon brightness.\n\nWhiffing a good, familiar smell, he shut his eyes for a little\nwhile, listened to her moving around, moving things around.\n\n\"Hi.\"\n\nHe opened his eyes. Kate was crouched before him. He propped\nhimself up on one elbow.\n\n\"Oh,\" he moaned, touching his fingers to his temple.\n\n\"How you doing?\"\n\nHe shrugged and his eyes met hers, then shifted past her\nshoulder. Several pieces of luggage sat by the doorway. \"What's\nall that for?\"\n\n\"We're going away for a bit.\"\n\nHe yawned. \"We are?\"\n\n\"Yep. I'm taking you to the Maine house for a little while.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" he said, offering no argument.\n\n\"First, we're going to treat you to a nice hot shower. Come on.\"\nShe gently helped him up and out of the room.\n\nIn the bathroom she went about undressing him.\n\nHe stood before her naked, watching her dip her hand in and out\nof the shower, adjusting its temperature.\n\n\"Kate,\" he said, his voice rubbery.\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"You're an artist.\"\n\n\"Mm-hmm.\"\n\n \"Well, I was wondering. About when you've created something.\nWhen it's something really good. You know, like a new CD. And\nwhen it's all done, you have it and hold it in your hands. And\nthere it is. All said and done. You can keep going back to it,\nbut no matter how great it is, it's past. History. So. What I\nwant to know is, do you ever feel like you'll never be able to do\nit again? Do anything again?\"\n\n\"All the time, love.\" She took his chin in her hand and kissed\nhis forehead. \"But no matter how hard it seems at the time, if\nyou did it once, you can do it again.\"\n\n\"Promise?\"\n\n\"You know it.\"\n\n\"Good. Will you come in here with me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\nPART II\n\n\nChapter 7\n\n\nEating breakfast in the cafe had become part of Peter's daily\nroutine. The waitress greeted him as he sat with his usual pile\nof newspapers. She returned with a cup of coffee, a scone, and a\nglass of orange juice.\n\nHe was grateful for the privacy his vacation home offered. It was\nMatthew who had introduced him to the quaint town of Camden,\nMaine, a place popular in the summer with executives and their\nfamilies from Boston, Philadelphia, and New York, and over the\nlast three months he had been recognized by only a few executives\naround town. Today, however, anyone reading the \"Wall Street\nJournal\" would see on the front page of the business section a\nsmall picture of Peter's face, positioned three paragraphs below\none of Matthew Locke's face. Perhaps, after giving it a little\nthought, the reader would realize that he or she had seen him\nthere in the cafe or in one of the town's small shops, or walking\nalong the inlet. And after reading the story, the next time they\nspotted him they might even feel a pang of sympathy.\n\nIt read:\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\n\nWALLABY ANNOUNCES IMPROVED PORTABLE COMPUTER\n\nSUNNYVALE, CA - Wallaby, Inc., creators of the first all-in-one\nportable computer, announced today an improved and more powerful\nversion of its Joey computer, introduced just one year ago.\nWallaby's founder, the young and mercurial Peter Jones, was the\ninventor of the company's first computer, the Mate, nine years\nago and was the driving force behind both the Joey and the\nenhanced version unveiled today, the Joey Plus. The new version\nis easier to program, offers a faster processor, and boasts more\nbuilt-in memory configuration for running more powerful software\nprograms, which are now becoming available. It also features a\nslim, built-in CD-ROM drive for accessing multimedia titles and\nreference works, a faster 14.4K data/fax modem, and a brighter\nbacklit active-matrix display, all for the same price as the\noriginal Joey, which the new model replaces.\n\nAnalysts view the introduction of the Joey Plus as a feather in\nthe cap of Wallaby Chairman and CEO Matthew Locke, who took the\ncompany reins from Jones after a boardroom showdown three months\nago.\n\n\"This demonstrates Locke's ability to manage a new products\ncompany,\" said Michael Kolohan of Quest Market Research, Inc.\n\n\"We're very excited about the Joey Plus computer,\" Locke said in\na telephone interview. \"Now there are no hurdles between\ndevelopers and users in offering powerful applications that\ncompare to those available for ICP computer users, our\nvalue-added being the easier to use design of the Joey Plus, and\nits more attractive, more convenient form factor.\"\n\nIn his new role as leader of Wallaby, Locke reorganized the\nformerly separate engineering groups, consolidating resources on\nthe Joey Plus project, which accelerated the device's\nintroduction to market by three months. To enlist the support of\nsoftware developers, Locke took to the road, evangelizing with\nprototypes of the powerful new Joey Plus to stimulate new\nsoftware development prior to today's announcement.\n\nOne developer, PowerBase, Inc. of Cupertino, California, will\nsoon introduce an program for compound document and forms\nprocessing, and advanced communications abilities. Said Paul\nKupiec, president of PowerBase, \"Wallaby really delivered with\nthe new Joey Plus. We're ecstatic, now that it's got so much room\nfor bigger applications, which means corporate clients we could\nnot previously appeal to are now more apt to consider Wallaby\nover ICP.\n\n\"We were all worried when Jones left the company,\" Kupiec\ncontinued, \"but Locke came to our offices in person with his\nengineering managers and offered us an early prototype unit of\nthe new Plus. We dropped everything and already have ninety-eight\npercent of our program completed, which we ported from our ICP BP\nversion. I think he [Locke] may fare well in his new role.\"\n\nJones, on sabbatical in New England, was offered a \"visionary at\nlarge\" role after being ousted by Locke and the company's board\nof directors, according to one source. However, Wallaby officials\ndeclined to comment on Jones's plans for returning in his new\nnon-management role. \"Matthew Locke hopes that Peter will return\nto Wallaby soon,\" said Wallaby spokesperson Laurence Maupin. \"We\nall miss him and look forward to having him back at work soon.\"\n\nJones could not be reached for comment.\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\n\nPeter folded the newspaper and sipped his orange juice. The sun\nwas hot and the air smelled fresh and clean. All around him,\npeople in summer dress clothes walked leisurely about the\nvillage, and the news of Silicon Valley felt very, very far away.\nHe closed his eyes...and a moment later he sensed a shadow\nblocking the direct sunlight.\n\n\"Think you'll go back?\" asked the elderly man standing before\nhim. Beneath his arm was a folded copy of the \"Journal.\"\n\nPeter eyed the stranger. \"I don't know.\"\n\nThe man placed his large, tanned and weathered hand on the back\nof the vacant chair beside Peter. \"Okay if I join you?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Peter said, leaning back in his own chair.\n\nThe man removed his cap and signaled the waitress. He fixed his\ngaze on Peter for an instant. \"Congratulations on the new\nproduct,\" he said with a wink. He unfolded his own newspaper and\nlaid it over Peter's copy. \"Your whiskers threw me for a second\nor two, but I used to slack off now and then on the shave -\nthough not because I was masquerading.\"\n\n\"It wasn't my product introduction,\" Peter said, stroking his\nlight beard unconsciously.\n\nThe man pulled a pen from his pocket, then lifted his thumb and\nwinked one eye shut like an artist gauging his subject. \"Hold\nstill. I want to get this right.\" He proceeded to draw a mustache\nand beard on Peter's picture in the newspaper.\n\nPeter was beginning to feel amused.\n\n\"Well,\" said the old man, taking up their conversation without\nlooking up from his artwork, \"you weren't there for the show, but\nit is your product just the same. Good work, son.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nThe waitress arrived. His portrait completed, the man shoved the\npaper across the table for the waitress to see. \"What do you\nthink? Look like him?\"\n\nShe looked at the photo and smiled politely, unaware that it was\nreally Peter in person and in the newspaper. \"A mineral water?\"\nshe said.\n\n\"Thank you, my dear. Anything for you, Mr. Jones?\"\n\n\"No thanks.\"\n\nThe man closed his eyes and turned his smiling face into the sun.\nAs Peter studied him, he felt a dim glow of recognition. Had he\nmet him before, perhaps seen a photo of him somewhere? There was\nsomething about the cynicism in the man's eye. No doubt he was a\nformer businessman well into his retirement, for with his eyes\nclosed, he looked maybe seventy-five.\n\n\"Here you are, Mr. Holmes,\" the waitress said.\n\nWith his eyes open, however, the man suddenly looked ten years\nyounger. Pouring the mineral water over the ice cubes in the\nglass, he fixed his gaze on Peter. \"It isn't easy walking away\nfrom something you've given birth to, is it?\" He squeezed some\njuice from the lime slice floating in the glass.\n\n\"No. It sure isn't,\" Peter said. Except for Kate's weekend trips\naway from Los Angeles, Peter had been completely alone for the\npast three months in Maine. During this period he had spoken with\nhardly anyone, except when necessary - ordering food in\nrestaurants, paying for goods at the general store, or collecting\nhis bundles of forwarded mail at the post office. He had\nforgotten how good it could feel to talk to someone, even a\nstranger. Especially a stranger. But Peter sensed that this\nwasn't just any stranger.\n\n\"Yep. Same thing happened to me. Gave them fifty years. Started\nwhen I was twenty, not that different from you. Yes sir, I\nremember how it felt.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Like someone ripped my heart out and chopped a chunk off it.\"\nFor a few moments the man's gaze turned introspective as he poked\nat the lime in his drink. \"Sound about right?\" His lively blue\neyes revealed sympathy, understanding.\n\nThis man knows, Peter thought. He managed a small smile and a\nnod.\n\n\"Son, you're a bright boy. I know all about you. How old can you\nbe, thirty?\"\n\n\"Thirty-two.\"\n\n\"Hell,\" the man said with a guffaw, \"when I was that age I'd just\ngot going.\"\n\nCrossing his arms over his chest, Peter considered the man with\ncuriosity and puzzlement. What had the waitress called him?\n\n\"Yes sir. That's how old I was when I invented a new system\ndesign that went on to become our standard for the next many,\nmany years.\" He took another sip from his glass. \"Still is,\" he\nsaid, jutting his lower lip out proudly.\n\n\"What design was that?\" Peter asked. But before the man answered,\nPeter deduced that there was only one computer standard that had\nbeen in existence that long, and that was -\n\n\"The 990.\"\n\nPeter tossed his head back, and for the first time in months he\nlet go a huge, cleansing laugh. Of course! Byron Holmes, inventor\nof ICP's 990 series, which had become, and still formed the\nfoundation of, the architecture upon which all of ICP's mainframe\ncomputers were built. Byron Holmes, son of Jonathan Holmes,\nfounder of ICP.\n\n\"What's so damn funny?\"\n\nPeter touched the man's arm in apology. \"I was just thinking how\nfunny it is for us to meet. Go on, please. What did you do after\nthe 990?\"\n\n\"Revise, revise, revise.\"\n\n\"Things moved more slowly back then, didn't they?\"\n\n\"Back then? You make it sound like I figured out how to add three\nwheels to one, so that families could take kids to the dinosaur\nraces.\"\n\nPeter could see that the man was enjoying this as much as he was.\nHe became wholly attentive and invigorated.\n\n\"You kids from the Valley think your teensy computers are going\nto replace our Goliath machines someday, don't you?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know anymore. I'm out of the business.\"\n\n\"Poppyshit!\" Holmes said, rapping his hand down on the table.\n\"Don't give me that sour-faced hurt-boy story. Doesn't fly with\nme.\"\n\n\"I made that company what it is,\" Peter said, instantly somber.\n\"And then it was taken away from me.\"\n\n\"That's craziness,\" Byron said, moving his chair closer. \"Boy,\nI'll tell you something. After I made the 990 what it is, they\nmoved me into big management. Sure, it was my dad's company. But\nI had the right education for it, so I could have done it anyway\nif my heart had been in it. But it wasn't. All I wanted to do was\nmake those big, beautiful machines. After a short while I stepped\ndown, moved in another fella, a guy that managed the schedule and\nall that stuff. Kept our friendship golden after all these years.\nNow he's the big cheese there.\n\n\"I stuck around for a long time. I was vice chairman, and spent\nyears evolving the 990 design into what it is now, which'll\nprobably see them through to the year 2000. As I was nearing the\nage everyone says is the time to leave, I had a heart attack.\nGuess I thought I was still a youngster. I retired, and me and my\nwife have been enjoying ourselves and playing around like kids\never since. Not bad for seventy-four years young, eh?\"\n\n\"But it's not the same. I could have run the company. With all\ndue respect, you inherited yours. I started mine from scratch.\nThey just didn't give me a chance,\" Peter said.\n\nThe older man discounted the younger with a wave of his arm.\n\"Nah. You'll come around eventually. Can't have both, you know.\"\n\n\"I could.\"\n\nThe older man's tone turned serious. \"That's just pure,\none-hundred percent poppyshit, is all.\" He pointed his finger at\nPeter with rigid authority. \"You need to squeegee all that anger\nout of your system so you can get back out there and do\nsomething. Again.\"\n\nJust then a handsome smiling woman appeared at the table, dressed\nin a light, summery outfit. In one hand she held her wide-brimmed\nhat, in the other a bag of vegetables and groceries. Byron's face\nbrightened at her arrival.\n\n\"Is this man filling your ear with World War II stories?\" She\nhanded the bag to Byron.\n\n\"I haven't even gotten to those yet,\" Byron said as he stood.\n\"Another day.\"\n\nHe made introductions. \"Gracie, this boy is the one who invented\nall those pesky little computers littering everyone's desks out\nthere,\" Byron said. \"He's also been the best conversation I've\nhad here in awhile. Mr. Jones, it's been nice talking to you.\"\n\n\"Likewise,\" said Peter. The two men shook hands.\n\n\"Why don't you come by our house for dinner. Saturday night.\"\nByron said, tapping his shirt pocket for his pen.\n\n\"Thank you, that's very kind. But I've been sticking pretty much\nto myself, and I'm not much company - \"\n\n\"Nonsense! Eight o'clock,\" Byron said, scribbling his address on\na paper napkin.\n\n\"All right then, I'll be there. But I have a friend coming. Would\nit be okay if I brought her?\"\n\n\"Can she dance?\"\n\n\"No, but she can sing.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Grace said. \"Please bring her along.\" The couple\nsaid good-bye and then strolled off holding hands.\n\nWith some amusement, Peter settled into his chair and thought\nabout the irony of meeting Byron Holmes here. It wasn't all that\nunusual, since Camden was where so many men like Byron spent\ntheir summers. Yet, of all the people in the world, he'd never\nguessed he'd shake hands with the man whose surname was\nsynonymous with the world's first tabulating machines. Small\nworld, Peter thought. No, he corrected himself, I'm from the\nsmall world, and he's from the big world. But, as he'd just\nlearned, it didn't seem to matter how big or small your baby.\nWhen it's yours, it's yours. And this man understood that.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThe horses walked side by side, each carrying a rider through the\nsecluded wooded path.\n\n\"I don't believe you, that the only love you have ever felt has\nbeen for horses. Nonsense,\" Greta said.\n\n\"It is true,\" said Jean-Pierre, crossing his heart with his\nfinger.\n\n\"Ridiculous.\"\n\n\"Greta, I tell no lie when I say that I have been in love only\nwith horses. Nothing has ever come between us,\" he said, patting\nhis beast's neck affectionately.\n\n\"Frenchmen,\" she said with a dismissing wave of her gloved hand.\n\"Such talkers.\" Had he noticed? She took a breath, reminding\nherself to keep her left hand on the saddle.\n\nAnd, she wondered, had he noticed her color when he'd crossed his\nheart? Unless he was psychic, she knew that he could not see what\nwas going on inside her when he spoke of things such as his\ncountry and horses.\n\n\"Your husband, he is doing something very important today, no?\"\n\n\"Yes. It's important. To him. Some new computer.\"\n\n\"Indeed. I read about it in the paper. You must be very proud,\nGreta. Yes?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. He's done very well since he's been in control.\nVery busy,\" she said. She wished this topic to go no further. She\nlet herself look at him, into his eyes.\n\n\"Yes,\" Jean-Pierre replied with a nod that said, without words,\nthat he understood. It was the same look he had given her when\nthey'd first met after they had shaken hands, when his arm had\nbeen in a sling.\n\nThey continued along in silence at a trot, and Greta renewed\ntheir conversation with enthusiasm. \"Jean-Pierre, tell me more\nabout your country. Is the French countryside similar to Northern\nCalifornia, as everyone here seems to think?\"\n\n\"Ah, it is beautiful,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"All year is green out\nin the countryside where I was born. And clean when you inhale,\nand pretty, all fresh and tingling in your nose, in your heart.\nYou ride on and on and see no one for very long stretches of\ntime. Here and there, children are playing or doing chores, you\nsee a woman carrying a basket, a man with an ax. They wave when\nthey see you.\" Smiling, he waved to her as if to illustrate, but\nall at once his expression changed into a grimace, as though he\nwere suddenly in great pain.\n\n\"What is it?\" Greta asked.\n\n\"This damned shoulder. If I cannot even lift it to wave, how will\nI ever hold a mallet again?\"\n\n\"Isn't there anything you can do about it?\"\n\n\"Oh, sure. There are procedures. Surgery.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you get it fixed?\"\n\n\"It is complicated.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it's worth a try, isn't it? Wouldn't it be better to\ntry to save it, so you could play again, rather than give up your\nlivelihood?\"\n\n\"It's not that simple.\"\n\n\"Why? People get things like that fixed all the time, don't they?\nYou're a champion. How can you just stop playing?\"\n\n\"That's not what I mean. I don't want it to be like this.\"\n\nShe persisted. \"I still don't understand. What's so complicated\nabout your case?\"\n\nAbruptly he reined his horse to a halt and she brought her horse\naround. He was looking off into the hills. For all of his\nbroadness and strength, his maleness, she saw that she had\nunknowingly struck a sensitive chord in him. \"Jean-Pierre,\" she\nsaid, trying to catch his eye, \"I didn't mean to upset you. If I\nhave, I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"No. That's not it. You see,\" he said with a faint smile, \"I am\nan independent.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, really. You don't have to go on if you don't want\nto.\"\n\n\"But I do. I do want to go on. Right now, in Deauville, where I\nhave lived most of my life as a polo player, the tournament is\nunderway. Eight teams converge to compete for fifteen cups. The\nmost coveted is the Coupe d'Or. There is money as well. I, of\ncourse, was on the French team. I had a sponsor for the\ntournament, but because of this damned thing, I had to drop out.\"\n\n\"But if you get it taken care of, can't you play again, and make\nnext year's competition?\"\n\n\"That is the problem, getting it taken care of. It costs money.\nAnd because I am an independent and I had to drop out, I lost my\nsponsorship. What I am saying, Greta, is that I cannot afford the\nsurgery and therapy. That is why I agreed to come here as a\nconsultant to look into developing a polo club. I need the\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Jean-Pierre,\" Greta said, \"I understand how you feel.\" She felt\ncompelled to tell him about her own suffering. However, glancing\ndown at her gloved left hand, she couldn't bring herself to go\non. Hers was no common ailment. Granted, he was suffering, losing\nthe use of his shoulder, but her loss, she could not help\nfeeling, was greater. It was not the same. It was worse. And, she\nfeared, it might repulse him, and end the acquaintance they had\nbegun.\n\nThey continued along the trails leading back to the stable, back\nfrom her escape.\n\nFor the past three months she had gone riding every couple of\ndays with Jean-Pierre. It had started with his insisting that she\ntry some jumping, but she dashed that idea at once. However, she\ndid agree to go riding with him once, and had continued ever\nsince. The early mornings frequently found her on these paths\nwith Jean-Pierre, before he began his day. In addition to his\npolo club project, he trained a number of students. With each day\nthey spent together, riding along the lush trails, she acquired\nmore knowledge of horses and Europe, and of things she had never\nimagined before - most of all attraction, for the first time\nsince her marriage to Matthew, for another man. While she knew he\nwas here to research the potential for a polo club, he was not\nspecific about the details of his private life. Whenever she\npressed him for more information, he turned the conversation back\nto her, or went into one story or another that was full of\nadventure and intrigue. He told her that, like most polo players,\nhe was a thrill-seeker; his attitude was that all of life was a\ngame, one big gamble, there for the playing. When she asked him\nhow long he thought he would stay, he told her he was not really\nsure. All she wanted, she reminded herself continually, was to be\nable to keep spending a precious hour or two with him each day\nriding. But lately, when she left him after their ride, she had\nbegun to allow herself a little more; she had now and then found\nherself thinking about him during her midmorning bath, or just\nstaring out the bedroom window, across the treetops and off into\nthe near distance, at the ranch's gable rooftop. And sometimes,\nafter a morning ride, she would awaken on her bed, not\nremembering having lain down, his face the first image to appear\nto her, her mind studying and touching him before opening her\neyes and getting on with the day. Although she relished these\nmoments in his company, she could hardly wait to be away from him\ntoday, to be alone with him in her secret way.\n\n\"I have thought how good it would be to go back to France after\nmy project is through here, taking my meager savings, and my\nmeager arm, and finding a small ranch in the country.\"\n\nShe tightened her grip on the reins. \"Well, if you want it badly\nenough, you'll find a way to get back into the game.\"\n\n\"Yes, maybe. But for now I am a slave to this project. It's\npaying the bills, as Americans are fond to say.\"\n\nWith mild dread, she knew he would be gone sooner than she wanted\nto admit. Of course it would be better if he were gone, she told\nherself. She was married to a very successful man, and that meant\nsecurity and stability.\n\nYet as if to discourage her rational thinking, a burst of\nenthusiasm whipped through her. \"Let's race,\" she shouted, then\npressed her heels into Mighty Boy's sides. Before Jean-Pierre\ncould answer, her horse bolted forward.\n\n\"Cheater!\" he hollered, and gained on her quickly. They rounded a\nturn in the path and flew past wild calla lily flowers, the tall\nstems batting their horses' legs. She looked over her shoulder,\nexcited, and pressed Might Boy harder. Jean-Pierre narrowed the\ndistance between them and his horse fell into a synchronized\ngallop with Mighty Boy. She laughed at him and saw that he was\nhiding something behind his back. He saw that she saw.\n\n\"Not until you slow,\" he said, reining his horse to a trot.\n\nShe obeyed, dropping beside him. He leaned from his saddle and\nhanded her a single calla lily. She felt touched and overwhelmed,\nand closed her eyes for a moment, forgetting he was there riding\nright beside her. Then, suddenly aware of her obvious pleasure,\nshe felt embarrassed. Carefully she tucked the flower between her\nleg and the saddle, then raced off for the final stretch, hoping\nthe distance would allow her a moment to regain her composure.\n\nHe called after her, yet, when she turned once, she saw that he\nwas letting the stretch widen between them, as if he had seen her\nflustered condition and had, once again, understood what she was\nfeeling.\n\nThe soft black path turned dusty as she neared the barn. Her car\nwas parked in the lot. Jennifer's truck, parked in front of her\nhouse, was the only other vehicle there.\n\nShe brought Mighty Boy to a halt before the stable entrance and\nwiped her brow with the sleeve of her chambray shirt. Carefully\nholding the flower, she lowered herself from the horse.\nJean-Pierre had dismounted by the far ring and was walking toward\nthe barn. Normally, the horses would be hosed down, to both clean\nand cool them, but the groom had not yet arrived, so they allowed\nsome time for the horses to cool down a little in the chilly\nmorning air.\n\n\"I'd better be going,\" Greta said after some time had passed,\ntaking Might Boy's bridle in her hand.\n\nIn silence, they led the horses into the barn. The animal bodies\nwere lathered with sweat, and the fine layer of dust that covered\ntheir muscles was beginning to dry and crinkle in the shadowed\ncoolness. She reached behind her head and unclipped her barrette,\nallowing her hair to fall loosely over her shoulders. It was as\nif everything had changed as they walked through a near-dark\nsilence, like day into night. Her senses sharpened, like those of\na nocturnal creature. She knew he was looking at her, and she\nfelt awkwardly exposed. She glanced quickly at him. His eyes\ngazed at her with peaceful, deliberate regard. She maintained her\nlead into the barn with Mighty Boy, then Jean-Pierre stopped at\nhis own horse's stall, and she hastened her task at hand, in an\nattempt to be done and out of the stall before he had a chance to\ncome to hers. But as she worked with Mighty Boy's halter, she\nfelt his presence at the entrance of the stall. He pulled the\ndouble door shut behind him as he entered, closing them in\ntogether in nearly complete darkness.\n\nHer insides tightened as he slowly approached, the very act of\nbreathing becoming more difficult the closer he came. She blinked\nto adjust her vision, and busied herself with releasing the girth\nof Mighty Boy's saddle, but she was clearly having problems; she\nhad not thought to simply put down the flower for a moment while\nshe worked with the snaps. And, as always, there was her hand,\nwhich forever burdened even the simplest tasks.\n\nHe came to her rescue, and she froze at the touch of his large\nstrong hands on hers. And before she had to even consider\nretracting her flawed hand, he moved her aside and set about\nunfastening the girth and removing the saddle, leaving her to\njust stand there and watch, holding the flower.\n\nTime stopped. Even Mighty Boy was still. His stare was on her\nagain, but she willed her gaze to remain fixed on the hay-strewn\nfloor. If she looked up into his eyes, there was no telling what\nwould happen. Yet she made no effort to alter what was happening.\nInstead she shut her eyes, and tried not to think about how much\ntime was passing between them without words. What were his\nthoughts? Were they the same as her own? What were hers? She\ncould not focus on any of these blind musings. Unaware of her own\naction she had raised her head, as though all of him would become\nclearer if she trained her closed lids in his direction. She\nopened her eyes. Nothing in her mind could prepare her for what\nshe faced. The emerald intensity of his eyes pierced through her,\ninstantly warming her neck, her nipples, her loins.\n\n\"Come,\" he said, motioning to her with one hand, the other flat\nagainst the horse's side. \"Feel this.\"\n\nShe allowed him to lift her right hand and pull her closer. He\nmade her feel the animal's hot, damp flank, flattening his own\nhard hand over hers. She focused on his dusty manicured nails,\nhis long fingers, weathered knuckles, and tanned skin. This was\nthe hand she had fantasized about, touching her as it was now,\nand more.\n\n\"The strength of this animal, it can all be felt through his\nheartbeat. So strong,\" he whispered. She felt his breath on her\nforehead, and inhaled to try to bring it inside of her.\n\nMighty Boy stood steady as she experienced the bold breathing and\nstrong heartbeat drumming beneath her hand. \"Yes,\" she managed,\nbarely, willing her hand to stop trembling beneath his.\n\nHe slowly lifted her hand from the horse and turned her so that\nthey were facing each other. The flower fell from her free hand.\nHe removed the glove from the hand he was holding, then he\nreached for her other hand.\n\n\"No,\" she said, a little panicked. \"Not that one.\"\n\nHe nodded to let her know that he understood, then guided the\nungloved hand beneath his shirt. He pressed her palm to his\nchest, over his heart. \"It is no different,\" he said. Then she\nhad the other, gloved hand in his shirt. She felt his insistent\nheartbeat, so powerful in its pounding, the pulse of his life\nbeneath her hands. She raked her fingers over his muscles. The\nwild scent of horses mingled sharply with his spiciness. She\nclosed her eyes and took a deep, heady breath, and experienced a\nwave of pleasant dizziness.\n\nHe gripped her wrists and pressed her against Mighty Boy, touched\nhis lips to her ear. \"Perhaps this attraction I feel for you is\nthe first to come between me and my love for horses,\" he said\nwith a little laugh.\n\nShe shifted her head back. A bead of sweat jiggled on his chin,\nbeside a tiny flake of hay. She dabbed the droplet with the back\nof her bare hand, touched the hay flake away and pulled it past\nhis lips, yet did not let herself touch them. He took her hand\nfrom his cheek, then curled her fingers into his own. He inhaled\nthe fragrance on her wrist, kissed it.\n\nShe began trembling as he lowered his arm around her waist and\npressed her harder into Mighty Boy, layering her between the heat\nof two powerful bodies. She pulled her fingers free of his grip\nand plunged her hands into his long hair and down his neck,\nacross the hard muscles of his shoulders.\n\nThen, just as their lips drew near, Greta reeled her head away\nwith a shake, as if snapping awake from frightening dream - he\nhad taken her gloved hand in his own.\n\n\"No,\" she said, struggling.\n\nHe tightened his hold on her. \"What are you hiding, Greta? What\nis it you are so afraid to show me?\" Then suddenly, Matthew's\nimage appeared in her mind's eye.\n\nAn agonized moan escaped her, and she let out a small, frustrated\ncry. She had to leave, at once. \"I can't,\" she said, bringing her\nlips closer to his. \"Do you hear me, I can't.\"\n\nOr could she? Could she just once, to have him completely in her\nmemory forever? Yes, just this one time. Quickly, she thought,\nbefore Matthew returns and makes it impossible for her to go any\nfurther.\n\nLips parting ardently, she hungrily drew in his breath as their\nmouths joined.\n\n\nChapter 8\n\n\n\"Matthew, this is everything.\" Eileen said, placing a manila\nfolder before him on his desk. \"You've got about ten minutes\nbefore the meeting begins,\" she said, then closed his office\ndoor. He opened the folder. Before him was an assortment of\ntransparencies, his presentation to the board of directors and\nexecutive staff.\n\nYesterday's introduction of the new Joey Plus, which was warmly\nreceived by the press and the user community, would certainly\nwork in his favor this morning when he detailed his plan for ICP\nconnectivity.\n\nHe flipped through the films. They were perfect. He felt armed\nand ready to face for the first time all of Wallaby's power\nplayers in the very room from which three months earlier he had\nejected Peter Jones.\n\nHis intercom beeped softly, and he looked out of his glass office\nat Eileen. She tapped her wristwatch. It was time to start the\nmeeting.\n\nHe nodded and shuffled the films and his notes together into the\nfolder and headed for the meeting. Just as he reached for the\nboardroom door, it opened. Hank Towers appeared carrying a small\nplate.\n\n\"Good morning, Matthew,\" Hank said brightly. \"Give me just a\nsecond for seconds,\" he said, gesturing at the remaining treats\narranged on the long table outside the conference room.\n\nMatthew laughed good-naturedly and went inside. \"Good morning,\"\nhe said, addressing everyone seated around the table. He set down\nhis materials beside the overhead projector. Finishing sentences\nor the last bite of a muffin or looking up from their agendas,\nthe board members and executive staff voiced their good mornings.\n\n\"We're just waiting for Hank,\" Matthew said. Just then Hank\nentered the room smiling sheepishly over a plate of fresh fruit\nsalad.\n\n\"Matthew, congratulations on the Joey Plus,\" Hank said. The\nothers followed with congratulations, and someone clapped.\nAnother pair of hands joined in, and then another, until the\nentire room was applauding his success.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Matthew said. \"But the congratulations should go to\nall of your people who made the development of the Joey Plus\nsuccessful.\" His smile swept each face at the table.\n\nMartin Cohn stood and announced the agenda, a copy of which\nrested before each person. Four items down the list was \"The\nWhole World In Your Hand: Wallaby's Future - Matthew.\"\n\nAfter ninety minutes of standard status reports, discussion, and\nvoting, it was time for Matthew's presentation, and he stood.\n\"Should we break for a few minutes before I begin?\"\n\nHe knew his agenda title had them all intrigued - this would be\nthe first time anyone but Peter had revealed a major future\nstrategy for Wallaby. No one stood or motioned departure.\n\nHe dimmed the room lights, then switched on the overhead\nprojector and advanced to the first slide, a modified Wallaby\nlogo. Normally the logo depicted the baby kangaroo poking its\nhead out of a pocket, but Matthew's slide showed only the joey\nand no pocket.\n\n\"At Wallaby,\" he began, \"we've always been intensely focused on\nthe idea of people using a portable computer for their personal\ntasks and needs. This had been a successful strategy, inherent in\nour culture because we got our start by giving people the power\nto use our portable personal computers for exactly that: very\npersonal computing.\n\n\"But to some degree, we've been in the dark. In the early days we\nsucceeded because we were the only players. But we lost our\nnumber-one status to our largest competitor, ICP.\"\n\nHe changed to the next slide and paused for a moment, allowing\nthe visual analogy depicted to sink in. The slide showed the same\nlone joey, offset to the bottom left corner of the frame, and a\nsketch of the earth with the initials ICP stretching around it.\n\n\"International Computer Products is everywhere. They own the\nworld of mainstream computing. There's hardly any big business,\norganization, or function in the world that doesn't in some way\nuse ICP's products for its information processing.\"\n\nThe next slide showed the Joey Plus screen with little filing\ncabinets and documents positioned here and there. \"By design,\nWallaby's Joey Plus is the choice method of computing. The user\ncommunity has stated that, and we all know that.\n\n\"But competition from ICP with its BP system, regardless of its\ninferior technology, continues to grow at a steady rate. The ICP\nlogo on the front of its desktop and portable computers makes\nthem mentally compatible with its mainframe computers. And for\nthe past decade at Wallaby, we've all held a resentful attitude\ntoward ICP. This is due, in part, to the premise upon which the\ncompany was founded. We're a small, free-spirited company,\nproviding people with personal mobile computing tools contrary to\nwhat ICP has represented throughout its history - people acting\nas slaves to headquarters and mainframes.\"\n\nHe then showed a slide bearing an ICP BP computer graphic with a\ncircle around it and a slash through it, like the \"No Smoking\"\nsigns found in public areas. A few chuckles emerged from the\ndarkness.\n\n\"Consequently - by design, if you will - few of us at Wallaby are\napt to perceive an opportunity that could take advantage of ICP's\nGoliath size. Locked into our rivalry with ICP, we're too busy\nreacting, competing with our portable computer technology as if\nwe had a chance to displace its impersonal, worldwide\ninstalled-base of systems.\"\n\nHe let them absorb this truth for a few moments, then removed the\nslide, allowing a pause before asking his next question.\n\n\"But what if the Joey Plus were equipped to make a huge leap into\nthe big game?\"\n\nChairs creaked, and elbows settled on the table as those seated\naround the table moved forward to more attentive positions. The\nnext slide showed the Wallaby Joey Plus computer screen again.\nBut in this one, the ICP globe logo was orbiting within it, with\nthe baby kangaroo hopping from the U.S., across the Atlantic, to\nEurope.\n\nMatthew heard whispers and low voices. In an instant he\nunderstood his position with profound clarity. Here he stood, in\nthe place that for the last decade had been occupied by Peter\nJones, with his hand on the lever that, once thrown, would\nforever alter the focus of Wallaby. He threw it.\n\n\"I believe that Wallaby has the potential to penetrate the\nworldwide installed-base of ICP computer users by becoming more\ncompatible with ICP systems.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, Hank was the first to protest. Incredulous, he\nrose from his seat. \"Matthew, are you proposing we build an ICP\nclone computer?\" His alarm was amplified by the others, and the\nroom suddenly erupted into a rumble of questioning voices.\n\n\"Wait. Listen,\" Matthew pleaded. \"Please.\"\n\nHank dropped back in his chair, turning his attention to Matthew.\nThe others followed his lead and quieted.\n\n\"No. Hank. We would not, not ever, develop systems that operated\nICP's system software. First of all, we would continue with our\ndesign to evolve the Joey hardware, adding a simple, inexpensive\nport that would provide an easy connection to ICP mainframes and\nworkgroup networks. Second, we would implement system software\ncommunication hooks in our operating system, which would read and\nunderstand file formats and information from ICP systems. These\nhooks are what would enable the user to easily manage the massive\nICP mainframe databases from within Joey software applications,\nas well as share data between personal programs like word\nprocessing documents, spreadsheets, and graphics, to name a few.\"\n\nHank was slowly nodding. \"We're following you, go on.\"\n\nThe room fell silent, and Matthew placed his next graphic on the\noverhead.\n\n\"We've got a window of opportunity, and if we can act quickly and\nbring compatibility products to market in the next quarter,\nWallaby would enjoy the rewards of major penetration within a\nyear.\"\n\nThe attendees were leaning to one side or the other, whispering\nback and forth. What Matthew was able to discern sounded\npositive, and, sensing no opposition, he placed the next slide, a\nproposed schedule. Midway through the his timeline breakdown,\nGraham Stevens, vice president of personnel, spoke up.\n\n\"Pardon me for the interruption, Matthew.\" Stevens removed his\nglasses and folded his hands on the table. His face bore the\ntroubled look of a professor deliberating a complex formula.\n\"There's one thing that concerns me. Something that does not\nappear on the schedule.\"\n\nMatthew took a step away from the projector. \"Please, go on.\"\n\n\"This company, as you pointed out when you started, was trained\nto think of ICP as the enemy. Do you really believe we can get\nthe employees to support a strategy that slants us toward our\nbiggest competitor?\" His question was supported by contemplative\nmurmuring throughout the room.\n\n\"That's a very important question,\" Matthew said. He tucked his\nhands into his pockets. \"Perhaps the most important of all.\"\n\nIn fact, it was. He had asked himself the same question a\nthousand times. And he knew he had to be very careful with his\nresponse. Both the reason and the solution had come to him when\nhe had asked himself why, all along, ICP had never simply\nthreatened Wallaby with a hostile takeover. The reason was simple\n- ICP could not acquire Wallaby and hope for the company to\nsucceed without support from Wallaby's highest-level executives\nand employees. This was precisely where Matthew fit into the\nwhole plan. He was the horticulturist who would graft the sapling\nWallaby onto the deeply rooted, sky-high tree that was ICP. He\nwould nurture the company into accepting that this was the right\nthing to do, this second phase of providing compatibility with\nICP's systems. He would convince them that while maintaining its\npersonality, Wallaby would also grow vigorously in size and\nsales. Later, in the final phase - the plan's ultimate goal -\nafter Matthew's compatibility strategy had proven successful and\nthereby gained the employees' trust, the process for merging the\ntwo companies would begin.\n\nHe seated himself casually on the edge of the table. \"When Peter\nand Hank started Wallaby,\" he said, dropping a nod to the\ncofounder, \"they had a vision of placing into people's hands\ntheir own computing power. Naturally this was perceived as\ncompetition to ICP because it is also a computer company, which\nquickly brought to market its own all-in-one computer. But what\nI've come to understand is that we have a valuable product that\ncan make greater headway by coexisting with ICP's computers\nrather than try to overtake it directly. And if we carefully\neducate our employees that it's our vision to keep building great\nportable computers for individuals, which can also connect to\nother systems, then yes, we can pull it off.\" His voice was\npiping with conviction and enthusiasm. \"Joey, with its innovative\nmobile and expandable design, becomes the dynamic key that opens\ndoors to other systems and other markets around the world.\"\n\n\"It would be tough, Matthew,\" Graham said, curling his index\nfinger against his chin, \"but if we were to get you out there,\ntalking to our people about this strategy, I think you're right.\nWe could pull it off.\"\n\nDid this first agreement, from the man who raised the most\ndifficult question of all, presage the entire team's vote? Had he\njust persuaded them to place in him their faith to change the\nlifeblood vision of the entire company?\n\nHe switched off the projector and brightened the room's lights.\n\"Before I go on, it may be good to get an idea of how many of us\nagree on this strategy.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Hank said, helping him along. \"I think it's smart,\nmature. Clearly a direction in which we should consider moving.\nHowever,\" he cautioned, sweeping the group with his serious eyes,\n\"only if we can handle the perception aspect of it with the\nemployees. Only as long as we make them understand that we're not\nselling out and building a clone, that we are actually making our\nJoey the best choice of portable computer on its own, and in\ntandem with ICP's computers. If we can accomplish that, then I\nthink we could eventually come out ahead of the game.\"\n\nMatthew experienced an epiphany. Hank had just explained\nMatthew's strategy exactly as he wanted them to see it.\nFurthermore, Hank's approval signified a point that was\nespecially penetrating to the people seated there - higher stock\nprices. For each of them, this translated to even greater\npersonal wealth.\n\nMatthew quickly took advantage of Hank's definition, while the\ncarrot still hung in the air. \"Does anyone disagree with the\nconcept?\"\n\nHeads turned, searching for dissent.\n\nNone.\n\nHe felt a powerful thrill wash though him like the one he had\nexperienced at the last quarterly board meeting, when his\norganizational design had flexed Peter Jones out of his way. In\nthe last meeting he had been given the opportunity to prove\nhimself. Now, with the new strategy revealed, they had become his\nfollowers. They believed in him. That was what it all came down\nto. They trusted him with their future.\n\n\"Very well,\" Matthew said. He switched off the overhead lights\nagain and returned to the projector. With his finger on the\nswitch, he bade farewell to the old Wallaby, farewell to Peter\nJones. He flicked the machine on, and alighted the screen with\nhis next slide: \"The Whole World In Your Hand: Wallaby's Future.\"\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\"Thanks, Hank,\" Matthew said, gripping Hank's arm with one hand,\nthe other locked in a firm handshake.\n\nThe board room door silently swung shut, and Matthew dropped\nhimself heavily into one of the chairs and let out a long\nsatisfied sigh.\n\nHe'd done it. From here on, it would be smooth sailing. With the\nexecutive's support in the bag, he was now free to turn his\nsecret plan into reality. And what did it translate to for him\npersonally? The power and the rewards would be astronomical.\n\n\"How'd it go?\"\n\nHe had not heard anyone enter the room and, startled, he turned\nto find Laurence Maupin. For the briefest moment he just sat\nthere and admired her in her finely tailored light linen suit.\nHer soft and flowing honey-colored hair framed her fresh\nintelligent face, and in her delicate hands she clutched a small\nbundle of budding branches, held together by a blue ribbon.\n\n\"It went great,\" Matthew said, blinking with exultation at the\nsound of his own pleased voice. Then, unable to contain his\nsatisfaction, his smile broke into a broad grin. \"Really great,\"\nhe spilled, feeling remarkably comfortable in revealing his joy\nin front of her.\n\n\"That's wonderful, Matthew. Wonderful!\" she said, closing the\nspace between them. \"These are for you,\" she said, holding out\nthe bundle.\n\n\"Pussy willow,\" he remarked. He felt a tingling sensation in his\nfinger, where it had brushed hers. \"Where did you get them?\"\n\n\"Believe it or not, I found a bush of them in Woodside. I stole\nsome for you,\" she said with a mischievous chuckle.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said, able to meet her eyes only for a second.\nHer unanticipated arrival and the gift she had brought made him\nsuddenly feel awkward and boyish. It was as if the room, his\nheart, had all at once changed seasons, going from the promise of\nspring to the all-out heat of summer. He watched her flip through\nhis collection of slides, and he felt the light tingle return,\nthis time in another place, as she keenly examined his\nillustrations.\n\nShe beamed at him and tapped the topmost slide. \"Matthew, it's\nbrilliant. Just three months, and you're already making important\nchanges.\"\n\n\"Thank you. But you deserve some of the credit. Your coaching has\nbeen a great help.\"\n\n\"That's my job,\" she said. \"Eileen said you have no other\nmeetings this afternoon.\"\n\n\"None. I didn't know how long this would take.\"\n\nShe returned the slides to the manila folder, then circled her\nhands around the neck of the overhead projector. \"Then how about\nlunch?\"\n\n\"Good idea.\"\n\n\"Great. What do you say to San Francisco? I've got to run a few\nerrands, and you can drop me off at home later in the afternoon\nsince I don't have my car. It's being serviced.\"\n\nHe hesitated, then shrugged. \"Why not. I think I deserve the rest\nof the day off. And I haven't been to the city for lunch in a\nlong time.\" He had forgotten that she lived in San Francisco.\nLunch, then a ride home.\n\nThey gathered his materials and in a few minutes were on the\nhighway and heading for the city.\n\nHe felt relaxed in the car with her. With absurd clarity it\noccurred to him that while they had worked together almost\nconstantly for several months, everything they had discussed\npertained to business. How could he have been so focused on his\nwork and not gotten to know her better? Now, he decided, was as\ngood a time as any.\n\n\"How are you adjusting? This being your first full-time job and\neverything?\"\n\n\"Excellent. Of course, working with you has made it all worth\nit.\"\n\nHe had hired her fresh out of school, graduating with a\ncommunications degree from Villanova. The previous summer she had\nbeen an intern, working in the public relations department as an\napprentice speech writer. On two occasions she had assisted\nMatthew in preparing his speeches. The impression she had left\nhim with was so positive that he had had his secretary contact\nLaurence as she neared graduation, to ask if she would be\ninterested in working for him as his personal press assistant.\nAlthough she was inexperienced, she really had helped him.\nEnormously. Not only where his public image was concerned, as\nwhen she had smoothly handled the press for him after Peter\nJones's departure, but also with his self-image, the hours they\nspent together in coaching sessions, counseling him on his manner\nand style, reinforcing his self-confidence. He felt as though\nsome transformation was about to happen between them, some new\nlevel of communication.\n\n\"...right there,\" she said, pointing to the high hills and valley\na half-mile in the distance, to the east.\n\nHe had been daydreaming. \"I'm sorry?\" he said.\n\n\"My horse. That's where I keep my horse.\"\n\n\"At Woodside Ranch?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That's where my wife keeps hers, too.\" He remembered Greta for\nthe first time since leaving the house that morning.\n\n\"They have a new trainer who recently came to the States to start\na new polo club. He's fabulous.\"\n\n\"Maybe that's Greta's trainer.\"\n\n\"It is,\" Laurence said, then, quickly: \"I mean, he knows her,\nmentions her horse. He said Mighty Boy is the most beautiful\nhorse he's ever seen.\"\n\n\"He's something, all right,\" Matthew said, changing lanes.\n\n\"I'm happy to be riding again. I've missed it so. In school I\nrarely got home to see my parents in Los Angeles. My father\nsponsors polo players, did I already mention that? I'm sorry, I'm\nrambling.\"\n\n\"Not at all. I want to know more.\"\n\n\"Well, a couple of years ago my father spent a year in North\nCarolina, opening a new company. While he was there he got hooked\non polo. That was just when I had gone east for school. I felt\nlike I needed a break from La-La Land, and Philadelphia seemed\nlike as good a place as any, and the school was one of the best\nfor liberal arts. Anyway, I'd fly down to see dad every now and\nthen while he was in the South. We went to a couple polo\ntournaments together. By the time he went back home he was a\nmember of the Equestrian Center in Griffith Park, in LA. I was\nquite taken with the game myself, the valiance.\"\n\nHer enthusiasm was infectious, and Matthew was enjoying himself\nimmensely. In the distance the city came into sight. Seeing the\ntall buildings, the two magnificent bridges, the bay, he\nexperienced a sense of newfound being. He thought of Greta, and\nhow, in all the time they had lived here and she had had her\nhorse, Matthew had never been the least bit interested in her\nhobby. Yet when Laurence spoke of it, he was intrigued. The\nValley felt well behind him now. Before him lay a completely\ndifferent world, and his insides stirred with the same excited\nnervousness a schoolboy feels on a class trip. \"I don't come to\nthe city often,\" he said, \"so I'm at your mercy.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, you're in good hands. How about Union Square for\nlunch? It's near the shop where I have to pick up something.\"\n\n\"Sounds fine,\" Matthew said.\n\nThey pulled off the highway and wound their way through the busy\ncity streets to Union Square. He pulled up in front of the\nCampton Hotel, and the attendant took the car.\n\n\"Can we shop first?\" Laurence said. \"I'll just run in and tell\nthem we'll have lunch around two o'clock.\"\n\nWith an appraising eye, the formally dressed door attendant held\nthe door for her. After she vanished into the lobby he stole a\ncursory glance at Matthew, the man so lucky to be with such an\nexquisite woman. The other man's envy brought a smile to\nMatthew's face. A minute later she was back.\n\n\"All set,\" she said, then frowned. \"What's so funny?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" he said, overshooting his innocence. \"I'm just happy.\nI feel like I'm playing hooky,\" he said honestly.\n\n\"Come one,\" she said, tugging playfully on his arm. She led them\ninto oncoming traffic and, with city-smart agility, navigated\nthem to the other side of the street. They strolled past the\nHyatt and turned onto Post Street. The sun shone brightly on\nUnion Square, and a cable car bell rang out on Powell Street. He\nfell back a step behind her when they crossed the street to\nadmire the way her wavy hair bounced on her shoulders with each\ndetermined step. His eyes trailed to her waist, so perfect and\nslender, then lower, to the lovely curves of her bottom. She\nstopped so suddenly he almost crashed into her.\n\n\"This is it,\" she said, standing before an old shop. \"It's like a\ntoy store for me,\" she added, pressing through the doors. For an\ninstant he had the pleasure of seeing the flat of her hand\npressed against the glass. Even after they were inside, this\nimage lingered bright in his mind's eye like sunspots on the\neyelids.\n\n\"Come on,\" she said, tugging his arm again. She led him to an\nopen stairway that rose to the second floor. He saw various\nequestrian products as they climbed the stairs. Saddles hung over\nthe rail encircling the upper level, and rows of boots lined the\nwall, with riding crops, helmets, and assorted garments displayed\nthroughout. He trailed after her as she strode to the rear wall\nand stopped before a case of leather riding gloves. She spun,\nhands at rest behind her on either side of the display case. \"Do\nyou know about Swaine Adeney?\" she said, playfully affecting a\nBritish accent. \"It was founded in London in 1750. They are the\nexclusive suppliers of fine equestrian products to the royal\nfamily.\"\n\n\"May I help you?\" asked a young, dark-haired woman wrapped\ntightly in a tweed outfit.\n\nLaurence turned serious. \"I'd like a pair of these gloves.\" She\ntapped her finger on the glass in front of a simple brown pair.\n\nMatthew swallowed. Gloves. The thought of Laurence hiding her\nbeautiful hands inside a pair of gloves prickled his skin with a\nsensation that was very close to terror. He thought of Greta. Her\ngloves, so many gloves. Leather, wool, and cotton. Suede,\ncashmere, and silk. Oh, he thought with dread, those especially,\nwhich she had worn to bed every night since the accident...\n\n\"Do you like them, Matthew?\" Laurence said, flexing ten\ndelicately gloved fingers before him.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, forcing a smile. \"Very much.\"\n\n\"These are our finest pigskin gloves,\" the sales clerk informed\nthem.\n\n\"I'll take them.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the woman, accepting the gloves from Laurence.\nShe closed the cabinet and locked it, and they followed her back\ndown to the lower level. Before Laurence could withdraw her\ncharge card from her wallet, Matthew reached for his own.\n\n\"Wait, Lauri. I want to buy those for you.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly.\"\n\n\"Please. A small token of my appreciation,\" he said. \"Please?\"\n\nThe clerk accepted his credit card.\n\n\"I'll treasure them,\" Laurence said with a pleasant smile. \"Thank\nyou.\"\n\nThey strolled back to the hotel, where they were immediately\nseated in a booth in the rear of the Campton Place. There were\nfew other diners; it was late in the afternoon, and most of the\nsee-and-be-seen crowd was already gone.\n\n\"How about Champagne?\" Laurence asked. \"A toast your success.\"\n\nThe wine steward uncorked a bottle of Veuve Cliquot and they\ntoasted, and while they enjoyed an excellent lunch, she spoke\nagain about horses and polo.\n\n\"I would love to go to France. I've never been there. I would\ngive anything to see the championship tournament that's held\nevery summer in Deauville.\"\n\nHearing her talk about it, he thought that it might be exciting\nto go there. With her? Was that why it would be exciting? What\nhad happened in the last couple of hours? What was it she had\nsaid or done to break down the restraint he had exercised for the\npast couple of months, which he now fully acknowledged?\n\nWith this thought, and all their talk about horses, he thought\nagain of his wife, and the realization that this pleasant\nafternoon with Laurence would soon be over.\n\nBack outside, the attendant brought him his car.\n\n\"Where exactly do you live?\" Asking this question, it occurred to\nhim that he had learned more about her this afternoon than in all\ntheir of previous times together.\n\n\"In Pacific Heights. Well, lower Pacific Heights. I can't afford\nreal Pac Heights yet.\"\n\n\"Is that where you would like to live eventually?\"\n\n\"Not really. I don't think I'm really a city person at heart.\"\nShe directed him up Pine Street to Fillmore, then to a narrow\nstreet called Wilmot. Hidden in the middle of the busy Fillmore\nshopping district, it looked more like an alley than a proper\nstreet. He found its concealment unusually exciting.\n\n \"There, the second house.\"\n\nHe braked before one of three houses tucked into he middle of the\nblock, sandwiched between business establishments.\n\n\"Well,\" he said. \"I had a wonderful time.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" she said, folding over the top of the bag in her lap.\n\nHe paused, unsure what to do next. The air in the car felt\ncharged with possibility, promise. He acknowledged his attraction\nto her. She stirred in him feelings he had not felt in years,\nwhich now suddenly gushed free inside him after today's victory.\nWhen she had entered the boardroom, he had felt a potent sense of\nlonging. How long had it been since he had been satisfied, really\nsatisfied? Again his thoughts turned to Greta. He gave his senses\na shake. He resolved that after all he had accomplished, which\nLauri had helped him attain, he wanted to experience with her\ntheir own, intimate celebration. He wanted to take her hand, hold\nit, and kiss her, to feel her fingers respond in his own hand as\ntheir lips met.\n\nFrom behind he heard the sound of cars passing on Fillmore\nStreet, and ahead of them, a group of young boys were playing\nbasketball in a fenced school-yard. With a sidelong glance he\nstudied her delicate, childlike hands, the impossible softness of\nher skin. She was so much younger than he. She had been silent\nall this time, and finally she spoke.\n\n\"Do you have any children?\"\n\nThis startled him a little. Was she too unsure of what to do\nnext? Stalling, as it were? \"No,\" he said, \"no children.\" He and\nGreta had planned to start a family after the successful launch\nof Orange Fresh. But after the accident, which happened on the\nvery day that they planned to begin their journey into\nparenthood, the act by which a child is conceived never again\noccurred between them.\n\nSo that was how long it had been since they had made love, he\nthought. How long it had been since he had been with anyone that\nway.\n\nAgain Laurence broke the silence. \"Why don't you come inside for\na moment and see my place?\"\n\nHe accepted without hesitation, and a moment later they were\ninside. \"I've made do with my limited decorating skills,\" she\nsaid with a wave of her hand. \"I'd love your opinion.\" She\nexcused herself to the kitchen for a moment while Matthew\nwandered from room to room.\n\nHer apartment was a recently restored Victorian with black and\nwhite tile at the entrance and hardwood floors throughout.\nDhurrie rugs in light colors covered the floors in the living and\ndining rooms, and her furniture was a tasteful mixture of\ncontemporary and antique. The bedroom was tantalizing. Her bed\nwas an unusual steel frame design with a dreamy, sheer canopy\ndraped lightly over the top. Its message was at once powerful and\ndelicate. So were his feelings for her. He finished his tour and\ncircled back to the living room, where he found her standing and\nholding two glasses filled with dessert wine. \"Just a little sip,\nbefore you drive back,\" she said, handing him a glass.\n\nHe inhaled the bright sweet aroma, his eyes lingering on her hand\nencircling her own glass. She raised it to his, and he met her\nsharp, gray eyes.\n\n\"Here's to you.\" Her voice was quiet.\n\nHe touched his glass to hers. They each took a sip and, with his\nhead still lowered, he let his eyes stray once more to her hand.\n\n\"You like my hands, don't you?\" she asked simply, revealing her\nmindfulness of his regard all along, confirming it.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, his voice barely a whisper. He swallowed.\n\n\"Go on, then,\" she said.\n\nHe knew what she meant. He slowly reached out and traced lightly\nalong her index finger to her wrist, her thumb, to her glass,\nwhich he took. He had to have her hands.\n\nHe settled their glasses on the table in front of the sofa and\nfolded both of his hands around hers. Never before had he held\nhands so supple. But these hands belonged to a whole visage of\nuniform loveliness. There was the difference, he understood at\nonce. He had loved Greta's hands, yes, the power they had had\nover him, his pleasure, yet that was all. Just her hands. That\nwas why, he now understood, that they had had such an unusual sex\nlife. But Laurence was different. When he looked up from her\nhands, his heart quickened at his appreciation for all of her.\nThat was it, and he let himself go.\n\nHe pulled her hard against him, as if it were the first time he\nhad felt a woman's body against his own. In fact, it was. It was\nthe first time he was really feeling a woman with all of his\nmind. The sensation was overwhelming, this feeling of taking in\nher whole image. His mouth came down firmly on hers. He felt a\nmoan come from her throat as their tongues mingled with the\nwine's sweet aftertaste. He tasted her, felt the material of her\ndress, smelled her hair, understood that in her shoes were feet\nthat were no doubt as lovely to look as her hands, as rousing to\ntouch and kiss. From head to toe, he wanted to feel all of her at\nonce. Their hips pressed together and she pulled him closer,\nkissed him hungrily.\n\n\"Matthew, you've done wonderful things for Wallaby and for me. I\nwant it to keep going this way for you. Is this wrong, what we're\ndoing?\" she said, fingertips touching along the edge of his belt.\n\n\"No,\" he said, and closed his eyes with anticipation. Her\nfingertips slipped down an inch into his slacks. \"I mean yes. Oh,\nyes.\"\n\n\"It's yours for the taking, Matthew. All of it. There's no\nstopping you now.\"\n\nHer words drove him into a frenzy. He gripped the back of her\nhead and pulled her in close, his tongue darting in her mouth,\nover her eyes and around her ears. He coursed his fingers through\nher hair, everything coming to him in rushing waves of passion.\n\nYes, she was correct. There was no stopping him, them. He thought\nnow only of the bed. He pulled back from her. His trousers were\nundone and her blouse was open. He gripped her wrist and led her,\nwalking backward as he did so, to the bedroom. She grabbed the\nbottle of sauterne and raised it to her lips, following with no\nresistance. At bedside, she passed the bottle to him. He took a\nlarge swallow of wine, then set the bottle on the night table. He\nheld the liquid in his mouth and kissed her, then reached for\nmore, but she beat him to it.\n\n\"Wait,\" she said. She lifted the bottle, and with her free hand,\npulled down her bra and brought the bottle close. Staring into\nhis eyes, she poured some of the sweet wine over her erect\nnipples.\n\nNever before had he felt so avid. In his urgency, he pushed her\nback on the bed and crossed his leg over her smooth firm belly.\nHe hungrily licked her breasts, sucking wine from one, then the\nother, struggling to work off her bra and blouse.\n\nHe raised her farther up on the bed, her head settling into the\nsoft, feather pillows. This was the part he had envisioned from\nthe moment he had laid eyes on the striking bed.\n\nHe led her hands to the steel head bar, and she understood at\nonce how he wanted her. She gripped tightly, her knuckles turning\npale. She lunged for his lips with her own. He met them and\nforced her down with his head, urgently reaching between her\nlegs.\n\nHe worked his erect penis out of his pants. Gripping his hands\nbeside hers on the bar, he entered her. He tuned into her every\nresponse, licking her eyelids, feeling the movement of her eyes\nbeneath. He felt her teeth with his tongue, at the same moment\naware of her ankles against his calves, and he wasn't sure he\nwould be able to hold back very long. The feeling of the cold\nsteel in his hands welded in his mind the image of their\nposition, both gripping tightly to this linen-draped frame. He\ndrove into her forcefully, with unfamiliar awkwardness. It was\nbetter than he remembered, he thought, gnawing at her neck\nravenously as he quickened.\n\nHe climaxed almost immediately, shouting hoarsely with each\nburst. Once his tremors stopped he felt drained of all energy. He\nwas so, so tired. Barely pressing off the bed with his arms as\nher hips thrust upward, he tried to help her finish. She managed\nto lift much of his weight, but not without effort. Her moans\nwere coming in quick, strained gasps. For one trembling instant,\nbefore succumbing to his weight, she moaned. He collapsed on her,\nforcing her breath away.\n\nHe rolled away, onto his back, his legs twisted around hers, too\ntired to move them. Almost instantly, his breathing slackened and\nhe lay there depleted. He became oblivious to her, to them, to\nwhere they were, and to what they had done. He felt pleasantly\nused up, yet at the same time, in another part of his being, he\nfelt very full, larger than life.\n\nFar away now, a dreamy smile alighting his face, he heard\nLaurence's words once more in his mind as he dozed off.\n\nNo stopping you now...\n\n\nChapter 9\n\n\n\"Hey, you ready yet?\" Kate said, appearing in the bathroom\ndoorway.\n\nPeter stood leaning over the sink, cautiously dragging a razor\nacross his face.\n\n\"Hallelujah!\" Kate shouted, watching as the beard that had grown\nlong and scraggy over the past few months disappear into the\nsink. Peter paused for a moment and winked at her in the mirror,\nhis face white and foamy, then returned his concentration to the\nrazor.\n\nShe leaned a shoulder against the edge of the door frame and\nstood watching him. \"I like your face smooth, it feels better on\nme.\"\n\n\"Ouch!\" Peter said, jerking the razor from his face. A dot of red\ninstantly formed on his chin.\n\n\"So, Lancelot,\" Kate said, hanging her robe on the door hook,\n\"what do I wear?\"\n\n\"Whatever you want , it's just a neighborly thing.\" Peter rinsed\nhis face, then pulled the skin on his neck taut and inspected his\nwork. He saw that she was still watching him, and he took in her\nfull naked reflection before turning to face her.\n\n\"I think it's more than that,\" she said.\n\n\"What's more?\"\n\n\"The dinner. I think this Mr. Holmes is probably excited that\nhe's met you, and wants to get to know your better.\"\n\n\"Well, me too. I could use a friend here. I only see you for two\nor three days at a time.\" He crossed his arms, resting his rear\nagainst the sink, and studied her up and down with a playful,\napproving grin. \"You know, for a forty-year-old lady, you're\nstill quite a knockout.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah? Well for a thirty-something boy, you're not so bad\nyourself.\" She came over to him and slid her fingertips beneath\nthe waistband of his jockey shorts at the small of his back,\nrubbed her cheek softly against his. \"Mmm, this does feel\nbetter.\" They stood there for a while, holding one another.\n\nHe pulled away from her a little so he could look into her eyes.\n\"What is it about us?\" he said. \"What makes it work?\"\n\nShe considered for a moment. \"Well, we're a lot alike,\" she said,\nlightly kissing his nose. \"And a lot unalike.\"\n\nHe nodded and bowed his head, focusing on their touching hips.\n\"Do you think maybe we should be together more?\"\n\n\"Maybe.\"\n\n\"More permanently?\"\n\n\"Maybe.\"\n\n\"Maybe?\" His eyes widened a little as they sought hers.\n\n\"Petey, we work because we both have things in our lives that we\nbelieve in.\"\n\n\"Had,\" he mumbled.\n\n\"Have,\" she said, lifting his chin with her hand. \"You're just a\nlittle dry right now. You have to give yourself some time to let\nthings happen inside here.\" She knocked his head lightly with her\nknuckles. \"It doesn't all just suddenly change overnight, Petey.\"\n\n\"I know. But I've been thinking.\" He hesitated for an instant.\n\"What about maybe if I were to settle down a little, split some\ntime between here and California, take it easy.\"\n\nHer expression was full of attention and love, but not without a\nsmall and knowing frown. They had had the conversation before,\nusually when he was feeling depressed, and they both knew that\nneither was fully ready to settle down.\n\n\"And what if you and I, you know...\" he said, his voice trailing\noff, his hands brushing her shoulders.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But - \"\n\n\"Petey,\" she said, pressing her fingertips to his lips. \"You know\nthat once you get something zipping around in that carnival-quick\nhead of yours, you're going to be flying at a million miles an\nhour.\"\n\nHe smirked. \"Okay, maybe not marriage, but how about...I don't\nknow. I've been thinking more and more about the feeling I get\nwhen I remember back to the first time I saw a kid use a Mate\ncomputer.\" His voice became a whisper. \"Maybe a child in my life,\na baby, our baby.\" He stressed his grip on her waist and pulled\nher closer.\n\n\"You know I can't have a baby,\" she said. Her eyes were\nglistening. \"I'm too old, and I told you I tried long before we\nmet,\" she said. \"You know that. And yet you suggest it.\" Taking\nhis index finger, she lightly poked her taut belly in an attempt\nto make light of the situation. \"Closed for business. Sorry.\" She\ntrembled.\n\nHe pressed her head against his chest and rubbed the back of her\nneck. \"Hey, I'm sorry.\" He kissed her eyelids. \"That wasn't nice\nof me to bring up again. I'm really sorry. Okay?\"\n\nShe nodded and he wiped his thumb under her eyes.\n\n\"Petey, trust me. You just need a little time to think. You're\nthinking right now about what is today, and you're not giving\nyourself a chance to just take it easy.\"\n\nNow it was he who nodded and lowered his head to hers, and she\nhugged him. \"It'll come, Petey, I know it will. It will come\nagain.\"\n\n\"Promise?\"\n\n\"Cross my heart. Now put some clothes on,\" she said, slapping his\nrear. \"I'm getting cold and hungry, and we don't want to be late\nfor your new friend.\" She turned and strolled to the bedroom.\n\nSuddenly his underwear whizzed past her head, grazing her hair\nbefore landing on the bed. She stopped in place and set her hands\non her hips and turned around with a playful grin on her face.\n\n\"Isn't it fashionable to be late?\"\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\"Dinner is ready,\" Greta said from Matthew's office door, just\noff the library.\n\n\"I'll just be a minute,\" he said, turning to acknowledge her, but\nshe was already gone.\n\nHe finished typing his e-mail message to William Harrell, then\nclicked the send button. Piled on his desk were notes, charts,\nand schedules, each a vital facet of the overall ICP Strategic\nAlliance report he had been working on all day. Another Saturday\ndevoted to work, but that was nothing new. Glancing at his watch\nhe figured he could probably finish most of the outline by\nmorning, so long as he hurried through dinner.\n\nLeaving the light of his library office, he strolled through the\nuncharacteristically dark house. He padded down the long hallway\nand passed the closed dining room door, crossed the foyer, and\nrounded the corner to the family room and kitchen area. The room\nwas dark and there were no plates, glasses or utensils on the\ntable where they usually ate, just outside the kitchen and facing\nthe family room with its big-screen television. Only the day's\nmail rested on the table, where he had left it several hours\nearlier.\n\n\"Greta?\" he called, turning toward the kitchen. In the minimal\nillumination of the dimmed track lights he saw pots and pans\nresting with their lids ajar, a few gooey spoons. Having had a\nmoment to adjust to the darkness, he caught the flickering glow\ncoming from the dining room, which was accessed either by the\nfoyer or through the doorway in the kitchen.\n\n\"In here,\" came his wife's voice softly.\n\nHe rounded the turn and was a little surprised to see Greta\nseated at the formal dining table, facing him. The room was dark\nexcept for the gentle radiance from two candles. Silverware\nshimmered and crystal glasses sparkled in the soft light. Poached\nvegetables and steaming new red potatoes in delicate china bowls\nsat beside a covered serving dish. Between the candles, in a\nlarge vase in the center of the table, were pussy willow\nbranches, fuzzy and in full bloom. When he had walked in the door\nwith them yesterday, she had thought for a moment that he had\nremembered. But then he explained that someone from the office\nhad brought in bunches for everyone.\n\n\"Oh,\" was all he managed to say before he seated himself.\n\n\"I gave Marie the rest of the afternoon off,\" Greta said. \"I\nfixed it myself.\"\n\n\"It smells wonderful,\" Matthew said, smiling but puzzled. They\nonly ate in the dining room when entertaining guests. Why so\nformal all of the sudden?\n\nShe poured him a glass of wine and handed it to him, then lifted\nher own glass and held it out to him. But he had already taken a\nsip and was lifting the lid off of the covered dish. She\nhesitated, almost said something, and sighed instead. She tasted\nher wine and watched him for any sign of recollection, any hint\nof awareness.\n\nMatthew placed the covered lid aside. \"Wow, my favorite dinner,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"I know,\" she said, clearing her throat.\n\nHe gestured for her plate and selected one delicate hen for her,\ntwo for himself. He ladled sauce over his birds and vegetables,\ntook another sip of his wine, and dug in. Barely ten seconds into\nhis meal, and Greta could see that his mind was already somewhere\nelse.\n\nNo, she admitted to herself, he had not remembered. And with this\nknowledge came a strange aching feeling, a throbbing, in her left\nhand, where what had once symbolized their marriage used to be.\nThe doctors had told her that that would sometimes happen. That\nat odd times it would feel as though everything were in its right\nplace, like normal. The same was true, she thought in silent\nagony, of her marriage. At odd times it had felt as though it was\nall still there. But not now. Plain and painfully simple, he had\nforgotten.\n\nAfter a minute or two, as if remembering that she was there,\nMatthew looked up from his dinner.\n\nShe sat staring at him with shimmering eyes, her utensils still\nresting untouched beside her plate. Before he could say anything,\nshe spoke.\n\n\"Happy anniversary, Matthew,\" she said. A weighty tear dropped\ndown her face.\n\nHis body slackened. He set down his utensils. All at once he saw\nthe brightness of her lips, the accents around her eyes, the\nfine, glimmering pattern in the silk dress. He became acutely\naware of her perfume lingering among the aromas of the meal. Her\ntears were painting dark trails down her cheeks. He gazed down\ninto his plate, their anniversary dinner, and let loose a guilty\nsigh.\n\n\"Greta, I'm sorry. I'm, so, so sorry. With all the work and\neverything...\" He lifted his hands a bit. \"I just, well, I just\nforgot.\"\n\nShe reached her gloved hand across the table and touched his\nwrist. \"It's all right, Matthew,\" she said with a resigned smile.\nShe wiped her cheek with her napkin and lifted her fork.\n\n\"It is delicious,\" Matthew said enthusiastically.\n\nShe speared a few vegetables, chewed slowly, put down her fork,\nand took a long drink of wine, all the while watching her\nhusband's hurried consumption.\n\n\"Matthew, can you slow down? Please, can't we enjoy our dinner\ntogether tonight?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, honey. It's just that, you see, I've got more work to\ndo,\" he said, then tentatively added, \"for the trip.\"\n\n\"What trip?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow. New York. I told you I was meeting with Harrell on\nMonday, didn't I?\"\n\n\"No, Matthew, you did not.\"\n\n\"Hmm. Funny, I thought I said something. Sorry. See what I mean.\nI'm so overwhelmed these days.\"\n\n\"Matthew, you're changing in unpleasant ways. And there's nothing\nfunny about it.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"However selfish you were before getting rid of Peter Jones, you\nwere at least considerate and apologetic. Genuinely. Or so you\nseemed.\"\n\n\"I said I was sorry about forgetting. You're upset, and you're\nbasing your criticism on that.\"\n\n\"No, Matthew. That's exactly what I'm talking about. This new way\nyou're behaving. You say you are meeting with 'Harrell' -\nwhatever happened to 'William,' your friend?\"\n\n\"He's not my friend, Greta. He's a business partner.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course. Pardon me. And is that what we are too, Matthew?\nBusiness partners?\"\n\nHe shook his head as if to say he'd had enough. In fact, she\nthought, that was what was wrong, that he'd had enough of them,\nof the dead end that their marriage had turned into.\n\nWith an disgusted huff she poured herself more of the good French\nwine, held the glass beneath her nose and she gazed out the\nwindow at the reflecting pond beyond the foot of their estate.\n\n\"Maybe, Matthew, we should talk. Don't you think, especially\nsince tonight is our anniversary, that we should talk? What's\nhappened to us?\"\n\n\"Dear, I can't,\" he said, pausing to wash down a mouthful of food\nwith a swallow of wine. \"I'm going to be up until six in the\nmorning as it is. And I've got an early flight. I'll just be able\nto jog and shower.\"\n\nHe ate and she drank in silence for a few minutes, until she\ncould stand it no more.\n\n\"Matthew, is it going to stop? Is it going to change? Ever?\"\n\n\"What, honey? Will what stop?\"\n\nAny remorse he may have felt for forgetting their anniversary was\nobviously gone now she could see, forgotten with everything else,\nas if a switch had been thrown, his mind saturated once again\nwith his work. \"Matthew, do you understand that you are obsessed\nwith Wallaby? Really, you are worse than Peter ever was.\"\n\n\"It's not an easy job,\" he said, wiping a piece of bread in the\nlast smear of sauce on his plate. \"Replacing him.\"\n\n\"We never see each other anymore. Even when you two had your\nfalling-out, you saw him more than you see me now. Every morning\nyou're up at five-thirty, then you're at work all day, and I\nnever talk to you - \"\n\n\"Meetings.\"\n\n\"Then you come home and gobble down your dinner, barely a word\nbetween us, or if you do have anything to say it's about that\ndamn company, then you're off into your library until late at\nnight until you come to bed and fall asleep.\" Her breathing had\nbecome panicky.\n\n\"Look, I've got to do my job,\" he said, irritated now.\n\nShe leaned forward with her hands flattened on either side of her\nfull plate. She didn't care that her gloved left hand was there\nfor him to contend with. Maybe that was the problem, that she had\nnever really forced him to deal with it.\n\n\"Matthew, I'm all alone. You're all I've got. It's not that I\nmind being here all day, but when you come home, it's worse\nbecause then you're here but we're still not together, and on the\nweekends, like today, you work all day in the library.\"\n\nShe intended to force him into battle if that was what it took.\nBut what he did next completely disarmed her: He placed a hand\nover hers, the left one, and met her eyes with compassion. She\nfelt suddenly hopeful. She had finally gotten through to him.\n\n\"Greta,\" he said gently, \"everything I'm doing is for us. The\nthings I'm making happen at work are very complex and important,\nand these things will change our lives forever.\" He patted her\nhand and smiled. \"Soon it will slow down a little,\" he said,\ntossing down the rest of his wine.\n\nBut his words sounded shallow and condescending. Her hopes of\nunderstanding disintegrated and the throb in her left hand\nreturned with renewed force. She snatched her glass and finished\nher wine in one quick swallow. She poured another. Was there no\nway to get through to him? To make him see how close he was\ncoming to destroying them? \"Matthew, it's ruining us, and you're\nletting it happen.\" Nothing. She went for broke. \"Don't you see,\nI'm trying not to let anything bad happen to us.\"\n\nHe seemed undaunted by her warning. Wiping his lips with his\nnapkin, he got up, walked around behind her chair and placed his\nhands on her shoulders.\n\n\"Darling,\" he said, \"I have to get back to work now. Nothing bad\nwill happen to us. I won't let it.\" Then he kissed the top of her\nhead and left the room.\n\nShe turned her head and looked out at the pond again, and\nwhispered to her reflection in the window.\n\n\"Then I will.\"\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\"Poppyshit!\" Byron shouted, waving his glass at Peter, who sat\nacross the table. \"The problem with kids today is their parents!\"\nHe set his glass down firmly as if challenging anyone to dispute\nhis opinion.\n\n\"Dear,\" Grace interrupted, gently touching her napkin to her\nupper lip with raised eyebrows at her husband.\n\n\"What? Huh?\" he mumbled, confused. \"Oh,\" he exclaimed, dabbing\nhis lips with his napkin, wiping away a small piece of\nsauerkraut.\n\nGrace smiled and shook her head, her grin spreading wider when\nKate smiled back.\n\nPeter had chosen the subject of children to start the table\ndiscussion. \"I don't think that's a fair judgment, Byron,\" Peter\nsaid. \"I think it's more than just what goes on in the home. It's\neverything, all of society. Kids are hardly given a good example\nby their parents, their friends. Movies. Television,\" he said.\n\"It's like they've turned into MTV lemmings.\"\n\nThe foursome ate at an antique Shaker table, situated near the\nliving room hearth. The home was decorated in simple and warm\ncountry style. A charming, homey combination. Like Byron and\nGrace Holmes themselves.\n\nKate and Peter had both felt instantly comfortable when they\narrived a few minutes late wearing jeans and sweaters, which fit\nin nicely with Byron's work shirt and khakis, and Grace's simple\ncable-knit sweater and flannel slacks. Dock lamps dotted the\ninlet outside, and boats bobbed silently in the bay, glowing with\na fuzzy luminescence in the moonlight. Peter and Kate's own\nvacation home was situated a few hundred yards down the inlet.\nTheir dock was similar to the Holmes's, though they did not own a\nboat.\n\n\"We had primarily invented the Mate computer with no one in mind\nbut ourselves, computer guys,\" Peter said. \"But within a short\ntime, parents were buying them like crazy for their kids.\n\n\"We want,\" he started, then paused for an instant to correct\nhimself, \"wanted computers to be especially great for kids, to\nlure them away from the TV set. When some of the software\ndevelopers created really great learning games, it all took off\nfrom there.\" His eyes were shining with the clarity that comes\nwhen you talk about something you deeply care about.\n\nThey were silent for a moment then Byron looked up from his plate\nwith a frown. \"That's all well and good. And you're right about\nit, that children especially benefit from computers, and not by\ntelevision. Now,\" he said, pointing to Peter's plate with his\nmustard-smeared knife, \"how about you eat that bratwurst before\nit gets cold.\"\n\nGrace broke the silence. \"They have a computer at the foster home\nwhere I volunteer a few hours a week, one of yours I think,\" she\nsaid, smiling at Peter. \"Those little kids, and the bigger ones\ntoo, they sit there for hours and play games on it, and do\nhomework, and talk about all sorts of things I don't understand,\nin a language all their own. It's lovely how such a thing could\nbring these children together and give them a family of sorts.\"\n\nThe discussion carried on some more. Peter had not resumed\neating, so Grace got up and began to clear the table.\n\n\"Let me help you,\" Kate said.\n\n\"You get no dessert if you don't finish your meal, boy,\" Byron\nsaid. He rubbed his hands across his chest in post-Thanksgiving\ndinner fashion.\n\n\"Everything was delicious, Grace,\" Peter said. \"It's just that I\nhaven't had a very good appetite lately.\"\n\n\"That's all right. You can take home leftovers if you'd like.\"\n\n\"Too late,\" Byron said, spearing the remaining half of sausage\nfrom Peter's plate.\n\nWhen Kate and Grace were out of earshot, Byron leaned across the\ntable. \"You're a lucky fellow,\" he whispered. \"She's a pretty\nlady.\" He dropped a big wink.\n\n\"I know it,\" Peter agreed, looking out at the water. There was a\nstirring in his chest, and he quickly turned his thoughts to\nother things.\n\n\"Come on,\" Byron said, pushing away from the table. \"Let's get\nsome air while the ladies fuss and giggle.\"\n\nPeter had to laugh at that one. The thought of Kate \"fussing\"\nabout with Grace in the kitchen made Peter both happy and sad at\nthe same time. It was what he wanted now, yet it was what she\nwould not be for him. How could she be so sure they weren't ready\nto settle down? As far as children were concerned, they could\nadopt. Talking about kids, and knowing that there were none in\nhis and Kate's near future, had turned his dark mood of late even\ndarker.\n\nAs they headed out onto the deck, Byron pulled a small pouch from\nhis pants pocket, and from his shirt pocket he produced a briar\npipe. He filled the pipe in silence as they strolled along the\ndock. When they reached the end, Byron lit up. The glow of his\nmatch reflected back in the black water. That is just what I\nneed, Peter thought, a spark to go off inside my head.\n\n\"You know, boy,\" Byron said, shaking out the match, \"I like you.\"\nHe inhaled on the pipe, regarding Peter for a moment.\n\n\"Thanks,\" Peter said. \"You're a good guy, too.\"\n\n\"That's what my wife tells me,\" Byron said, exhaling a cloud of\nblue smoke. \"You and I ought to take a float out on this baby,\"\nhe said, poking his pipe at his boat, the \"Net Work.\" He sat\ndown, dangling his feet above the low tide, and Peter sat down\nbeside him. \"Listen, I'm gonna tell you something, and I want you\nto promise me you'll think about it. Okay?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"You're a bright fella. But you're walking around like a little\nboy who lost his old dog and hates the world for it,\" he said.\n\nPeter exhaled, his breath forming a faint mist in the cool air,\nand looked down into the water.\n\n\"Son, everything dies. It's how life goes on. Your pooch, he's\ngone. It's time to go pick a new puppy, and train it, and love\nit, and make it great.\"\n\n\"That's easy for you to say. You've done it all and it lasted\nlonger for you, most of your life, and you have a wife now and\nyou're happy.\"\n\n\"Poppyshit!\" Byron said. \"Do you think the 990 was the only thing\nI ever did with ICP? No way. I did all sorts of things with them,\nbut the difference is that I stayed on board, and times were\ndifferent then. I was trained to do the things I did. You're\ndifferent.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"You're a rebel. I was too, but in a different sort of way.\nYou're a real risk-taker, but not for the sake of taking risks.\nYou do it because it's the only way you know how to be.\"\n\nPeter nodded.\n\n\"You've got to understand and accept that it just takes a little\nhealing, over time. Time. I can tell you this because I've been\nthrough it myself. I almost died once, had that heart attack I\nmentioned to you the other day. Got it from not letting go.\nAlmost lost my life. But worse, after I got out of the hospital,\nI almost lost my wife. Ah, I don't want to get into all that.\nJust understand something mister, that this isn't the last time\nit's going to happen to you. You have to know that now, while\nthings are germinating up here.\" He tapped a finger to his head.\n\"When the next thing comes, when you start out all clumsy and\ngetting into it all over again, even if it's way back in the back\nof your heart, you have to accept that someday it's going to\nchange, end, and then you start all over again. And again and\nagain. You keep doing it. Over and over. And it gets better and\nbetter with age. Just like they say.\"\n\nPeter felt choked up listening to Byron so candidly share his\nexperience. \"But,\" Peter started with a little more than a quiet\npuff from his lips. \"But it hurts.\"\n\n\"Of course it hurts,\" Byron said. \"But you pick up, dust yourself\noff, and go at it again. Where do you think all this age-old\nadvice comes from? It's truth, friend, that's why you're hearing\nit from me. Sure thing.\"\n\n\"I don't know. It's not all the same, you've got more that\nmatters,\" Peter said, hitching his thumb absently in the\ndirection of Byron's home.\n\n\"Hah, boy's blind, too. I see a lady in there who looks at you\nwith real fancy in her eye. She's standing by you strong, I know\nit.\"\n\nByron took his pipe from his mouth and looked thoughtfully into\nits bowl. \"I'll give you something to think about, and you let it\nroll around in your head a bit.\" He sniffed. \"Thing is, is I've\nbeen bored lately. Yeah, I love it here, and our home in\nConnecticut, and Gracie, and we've been talking about maybe\ntraveling again this winter,\" he said, waving his pipe in the\ngeneral direction of everywhere in the world, \"but I've been\nfeeling sort of itchy. Like I gotta do something. You ask me, I\nthink there was a reason for us running into each other the way\nwe did.\"\n\n\"How's that?\"\n\n\"I don't know why. Not yet, anyway. I suspect it has something to\ndo with our difference in thinking. I mean that in a good way. We\ncome from different worlds, yet we we're not such different\nbeings. If you and I put our heads together, I bet we could\nreally show the rest of 'em a thing or two.\"\n\n\"Think so?\"\n\nByron winked. \"I know so,\" he said, patting Peter on the leg.\n\"Now come on,\" he said, rising to his feet. \"Let's go get us a\nslice of that apple pie.\"\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nShe set the dirty dishes in the sink, wrapped the leftovers in\nfoil. On the counter, there sat a cranberry and apple crumble she\nhad made for dessert. The bourbon sauce, which was to be warmed\nand drizzled over the piping dessert, sat in a saucepan on the\nstove, a gloppy mess. She dumped it down the drain and left the\ndishes in the sink for Marie to deal with in the morning.\n\nMatthew was back in his office working, and Greta stood with the\nlast of the wine in her glass gazing out the kitchen window at\nthe valley beyond.\n\nWhen was it going to end, she had asked him. But she knew the\nanswer to that question. There were two answers, really. The\nfirst was that it was never going to end, and the second was that\nit already had. She had tried - for the last time? - to break\nthrough the wall he had over the years erected between them. But\nshe knew now, after tonight's dinner, that the wall would only\ngrow higher, thicker. After Matthew turned Wallaby into what he\nwanted, then sold it to ICP, it would be no different when he was\npromoted to a higher rank within ICP, perched atop his\never-growing blockade. Maybe they would stay in California, but\nprobably they would have to go back to New York, to ICP's\nheadquarters. Though she sometimes missed New York, the thought\nor returning held little appeal. There her friends were all wives\nof the other International Foods executives, and out here,\nregardless of all she had heard about the nice people in\nCalifornia, the women were still the same, robots who yessed\ntheir husbands at social occasions and dinner parties, while\nbehind their backs they, and their husbands, engaged in\nextramarital affairs.\n\nThat wasn't how Greta wanted to end up living her life. But would\nshe?\n\nShe finished her wine and set the glass on the counter - a little\ntoo firmly. The crystal base shattered into little bits with a\nhigh resonating tinkle, yet the bowl of the glass remained intact\nin her hand.\n\n\"Shit,\" she cried, the sound breaking a dam in her, releasing a\nflood of tears. She tossed the unbroken half into the sink, which\nechoed the same tinkling sounds, even louder this time. She held\nher breath, wondering if he had heard, wondering if would come to\nsee if she had injured herself. She waited, holding on to this\nfragile hope with all of her breath.\n\nIf he had heard, he wasn't letting her know. She let out a great\nsigh. Jesus, was that her life with Matthew? Shattered, broken\nbeyond repair? It was too much to consider at this moment. She\nneeded to get out of the house for a little while, to go for a\nwalk in the pretty night and clear her head.\n\nShe snatched her windbreaker from the coat hook beside the door\nto the garage and stepped outside into the evening's coolness.\nShe wandered down the sloping hill to the high, solid gate. She\nstepped through the gateway and hiked down the trail to the edge\nof the pond with its narrow dirt path.\n\nEventually, if she followed it, the path would lead her to the\nhorse stables. Sometimes she rode Mighty Boy along here, circling\nthe entire pond and back around to the stable, passing her own\nhome on the way. Quickly and steadfastly she strode through the\ntwisted, tree-lined path in the moonlight. The stables lay a\nhalf-mile ahead.\n\nIt was supposed to have been her night to celebrate the memories\nof her marriage, but now she found herself thinking about the\nscene that had taken place in Mighty Boy's stall the other day.\nFor better or worse, she had stopped him. She had admitted to him\nthat she and Matthew were having problems, but they were still\nmarried, and even though she had desperately wanted him to go on,\nshe said she could not let herself be with him. He had released\nher, and assured her that it would not happen again. Unless, he\nsaid, she came to him. Since that day she had not gone back to\nthe ranch.\n\nShe slowed for a moment, then stopped. She absently stroked her\nleft hand with her right hand as she examined her present state\nof mind. What was she going to do, just knock on the door of his\ncottage? She turned and looked back up the hill to her home. A\nfew lights glowed - Matthew's office. She swallowed, and her left\nhand throbbed some more.\n\nYes, she decided, that was exactly what she was going to do.\n\nShe moved on, her pace quickening, her heart pumping. Shortly the\nstables came into view, illuminated by both the light of the moon\nand by the floodlights surrounding the property. Trailing along\nthe border of light, just beyond its edge, she grew excited and\nreckless, like an inexperienced burglar. Her brisk walk had\nwarmed her and she unzipped her jacket as she stealthily slipped\naround the stable.\n\nShe passed the main house, where the ranch's owner lived alone.\nPurple-blue light flickered from an upstairs window. About fifty\nyards from where she stood were two small cottages. She had\npassed them many times while riding. Jean-Pierre lived in one of\nthose cottages, and though she had never been invited inside, she\nknew which one was his because he had mentioned once that it\nafforded a beautiful view of the pond from his bedroom window,\nthrough which he could see her home and its rear upstairs light\nglowing late at night. Though her home was too high and far away\nfor him to see inside, she was excited by the thought of him\nlying in his dark bedroom, fixated on her bedroom window. Had he\never glimpsed her passing the window, closing the curtains?\n\nThe sound of a car engine starting suddenly broke through the\nquiet evening. A second later a swath of light beamed just a foot\nbeside her and beyond, as far as she could see, into the woods.\nShe ducked behind a small wooden utility shed stationed alongside\nthe drive. White light pierced through the tiny cracks and seams\nof the shed. Cautiously she peeked around its edge. A car\nappeared from between the cottages, its light sweeping past the\nshed as it steered onto the drive. Greta flattened herself\nagainst the side of the small building and crept around the\ncorner once the car had completely passed.\n\nWas he going out for the night? The sound of the engine grew\ndistant, then came a high squealing noise when the car reached\nthe end and turned onto the main road. Once more, the sounds of\nthe night and her own pulse were all she could hear. She left her\ncover and pressed on.\n\nNo, she saw at once, it hadn't been Jean-Pierre because his MG\nwas parked in front of the cottage. Avoiding the light cast by\nthe lamp outside the front door, she circled around to the back\nof the small house. She peered into the bedroom window. The room\nwas lit by a small lamp beside an empty bed with twisted sheets.\nThe sight caused her breath to catch. She rushed to the back\nstoop and halted before the door, flexed her hands a few times.\nFeeling the night's coolness breezing through the silken material\nof her gloves, she absently wiped them on her dress and turned\nand faced the pond for a moment to collect her thoughts.\n\nCould she really go through with this? Her eyes searched across\nthe small shining lake, along to the narrow shore and the trail's\nedge, up the hill. Her home. She could see the very window where\nshe had stood just minutes earlier, and she could see too the\ndamned glow coming from Matthew's office, where, on their\nanniversary night, he was fondling his true love, Wallaby.\n\nYes, she could go through with this, and would. She turned and\nknocked three times on the Dutch door, so loudly that she\nstartled herself. She heard the short, hollow tamp of footsteps,\nthe clacking sound of the door latch. For an instant it felt as\nif her wedding band had tightened around her finger. Irrational.\n\nThe top half of the door swung open, and there he stood, wearing\nonly jeans and wire-framed reading glasses. His expression bore\nno surprise. A knowing smile formed on his full lips. She started\nbreathing again. Plumes of mist danced around her head as the\nwarmth of the cottage bled outside into the chilly air. He\nremoved his glasses and closed the top door for a moment, then\nthe entire door opened and he stepped back, his arm extended. She\nquickly and nervously glanced around the room as she went inside,\ntaking in at once its simple furnishings and his things. There\nwere boots beside the front door, a black T-shirt tossed over the\nback of the couch, a beer bottle beneath the shaded lamp, a\nwineglass beside the bottle, a pair of brown leather gloves\nbeside the glass. She heard her own blood pulse in her ears, felt\ndizzy and a little buzzed by the wine, the rush of activity, and\nnow the stillness.\n\nFollowing her gaze, Jean-Pierre quickly stepped into the tiny\nliving room. He picked up the gloves. They were women's gloves,\nshe could see that now. Everything was happening so fast.\n\nHis shoulders sagged. \"You saw them,\" he said.\n\nHer eyes quickly jumped to the bottle, to the glass, to the\ngloves, back to the glass. She thought of the car that had just\ngone. She looked into his eyes. \"What?\" she said, her voice not\nsounding like her own.\n\nHe held the gloves out to her. \"I wanted to wrap them and\nsurprise you.\"\n\nShe blinked. \"For me?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nShe accepted the gloves in her right hand. There were a few\nsmall, barely noticeable scratches on them, but the stitching was\nclean and new. She wanted to say something, but when she looked\ninto his eyes again, whatever she had thought she wanted to say\nvanished, and in its place was desire, like what she had felt\nwhen he kissed her in the stall.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she managed as she absently watched him take back\nthe gloves and carefully fold them over, then tuck them into her\njacket pocket.\n\nHe took her by the shoulders and kissed her. Her eyes were still\nclosed and lips slightly parted when he pulled his face away. She\nhad come to him, and now she needed him to guide her.\n\nHe stepped aside and indicated the way to the bedroom. She moved\nand he trailed her holding one of her hands in his, the one she\nwould let him hold. Had he figured it out yet, she wondered,\nabout the other one. She stopped beside the bed, facing the pond.\nHe switched off the lamp and placed his hands on her shoulders.\nShe struggled to see clearly, but could not. He pressed his hard\nbody against her back. The air was all made of his scent,  musky,\nsexy, alive. She wanted to be tumbled and spun in the tangled\nsheets that lay before her, to move her hands between their\nsoftness and his firmness, to flop into the pillows, his weight\nhard on her, his mouth on hers. She closed her eyes. Yes, his\nmouth, which was now gently kissing the back of her neck, his\nlips pulling the small hairs at the base of her skull. She\ntwisted her head into the warmth of his hot and chilling breath.\nA small sound escaped her as he slid her windbreaker from her\nshoulders. It fell to the ground with a soft rustle. She closed\nher eyes and reached her good hand to her left shoulder, placing\nit over his hand. She leaned back into his hardness and he\npressed himself against her more firmly. The wine had helped to\nnumb her feelings, and now the charged atmosphere of his bedroom\nmelted her into yielding. Even her left hand felt normal.\n\nI tried, God as my witness, I tried, she thought with a shudder\nas he wrapped his arms around her and across her breasts. He held\nher until her trembling subsided, then he began to unzip her\ndress, very slowly. She opened her eyes. Her vision had adjusted\nto the silvery light, which now sharpened the edges of everything\nand cast ambiguous shadows.\n\nAnd there, across the pond, she saw Matthew's lamp.\n\n\"No,\" she said, reaching behind for her zipper.\n\nHe gripped her wrist.\n\n\"Yes,\" he breathed hotly in her ear.\n\nShe challenged his hold. Unable to resist, she yielded, spun\nfiercely, and sought his lips. He held her head between his hands\nand kissed her, pushing against her so intensely she felt she\nwould burst into flames. Her hands slid up his chest and across\nhis shoulders, his broad back. This hardness, I want this on me,\nwas all she could think, I have to have this in me.\n\nBut again, as if burning into her back, Matthew's library lamp\nbroke her, mocked her. With a cry, she twisted around. \"No. I\ncan't. Not with him right there.\"\n\n\"We'll pull the shade,\" Jean-Pierre said. He nuzzled his nose in\nher hair.\n\n\"No,\" she said, planting herself firmly. \"Not now. Not with him\nthis close.\"\n\n\"Then when, Greta? When?\"\n\nThis had been a mistake. She had to get away. \"Tomorrow,\" she\nsaid, pulling away from him. \"Tomorrow, Jean-Pierre.\" She tugged\nat her dress, putting some more distance between them as she\nrearranged herself. Her expression was final, forbidding. She\nwanted to remember him just like this, standing before her with\nhis arms at his sides, his bright white teeth and eyes, the\nsilvery sharp edges of his muscled chest.\n\n\"Where?\" he asked, taking her by the elbows.\n\n\"Matthew is going to New York. I'll call you.\" Afraid that the\ngentle yet firm and alluring touch of his powerful hands would\nstall her, she forced herself to pull away.\n\nHe handed her her jacket, and followed her into the light of the\nliving room. She opened the door, turned around, and slipped on\nher jacket, zipping it firmly.\n\nHe clasped one hand on the door's edge. With the other he gripped\nher wrist and pulled her close. She gasped. He kissed her long\nand deeply. The cold night air chilled her back, while the heat\nof his mouth warmed her insides. She drew away with a frustrated\nmoan.\n\nHe raised her good hand to his lips and brushed it lightly. The\nstubble of his beard on the silken material caused a sound that\nhad an extraordinary effect on her lower regions. She pressed her\nupper thighs together.\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" he said, and released her.\n\nShe nodded, then was off and back into the night, back to her\nhome.\n\nRunning through the chilly night she remembered the gloves in her\npocket. She stopped and removed her silk gloves and put on the\npair he had given her. They made her feel secure and warm, but\nnot all the way. Perhaps they would feel right once she had the\nleft one tailored to accommodate her shortcoming.\n\nWhatever it takes, she solemnly vowed, whatever it takes.\n\n\nChapter 10\n\n\n\"Mr. Harrell, Mr. Locke has arrived.\"\n\n\"Send him in, please,\" came William Harrell's voice thinly from\nthe intercom on his secretary's desk.\n\nMatthew was surrounded by the kind of opulence afforded only by\ncompanies at the highest reaches of the Fortune 500. Plush\ncarpets, deep, rich wooden desks, fine art originals, and people\nreferring to one another as Mr., Ms., Mrs., and \"sir.\" It was a\nsobering contrast to Wallaby's compact, Herman-Miller modular\npartition offices, open-air buildings, and first-name protocols.\nHad it been only three years since Matthew had occupied an office\nat International Foods very much like this one, so expansive it\nwas more like a penthouse apartment than an office? Matthew's own\noffice at Wallaby was no larger than the standard manager's\noffice, just big enough to move around comfortably in. He felt\nqueerly out of place entering the ICP building, surrounded by\nsuch abundance, such magnitude. He had even forgotten how long it\ntook for elevators to climb tall buildings; Wallaby's tallest\nbuilding was only three stories high, and almost everyone used\nthe central atrium stairs to travel between floors.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders to straighten his suit - yet another\ndifference between casual West Coast wizardry and starchy East\nCoast Big Business. He had felt uncomfortable walking through the\ncity, unable to see more than a few blocks in any direction,\nsurrounded by noise, exhaust, and serious faces. Indeed,\nCalifornia, with its rolling hills and vistas, mild weather, and\nno-hurry attitude had affected him more deeply than he had\nrealized.\n\nIn one hand he carried his briefcase, in the other a large binder\ncontaining all of Wallaby's product plans, financial summaries,\nand forecasts, as well as the strategy he had worked on two\nnights ago. He had finalized the strategy on the plane yesterday\nand printed the finished copy in his hotel suite last night with\nhis Joey Plus and portable printer.\n\nHe had come to think of the binder as his clay, molded into the\nshape of a new Wallaby, a grassroots company deemed a serious\nplayer by the most important counsel of all, based in this very\ncity: Wall Street. Since last week's introduction of the new Joey\nPlus, Wallaby's stock had climbed four points, and reviews were\nglowing.\n\nIt was all very exciting. So much so it had affected him in his\nsleeping hours. Last night he had had a shadowy, romantic dream,\nthat he was as a gemologist transporting precious jewels for\nSotheby's of London...then it shifted, and the gems had changed\nto secret documents for the CIA...then it turned out that he was\nworking not for the CIA, but for them...the other side. When he\nleft the hotel this morning for his meeting, he felt as if he\nwere holding in his hands his fate, his life. Many lives. And\nthen a macabre thought entered his mind, left over from his\nexotic dream: Where was the cyanide pill? He had no cyanide pill\nif he was caught. It was a preposterous notion of course, his\nimagination getting the better of him. Nevertheless, still a\nlittle intrigued by the role his dream had cast him in, he strode\ninto William's office with his life in his hands and a feeling of\npure elation, and just a little fear. Good fear.\n\n\"Hello, Matthew,\" William said heartily, rounding his wide desk\nwith his hand extended. He wore a perfectly tailored charcoal\nbusiness suit, a crisp white shirt, and a burgundy tie. The man's\nentire appearance exuded sharpness, Big Business. In other words,\nICP.\n\nMatthew set his briefcase on the thickly carpeted floor,\nclutching the binder in his left hand. He noticed William's\nimpeccable manicure as they shook hands. Matthew's own\nfingernails were chewed and dry, and he could not remember the\nlast time he had had a manicure himself. He was beginning to feel\nas if he were underdressed, as if he had underestimated the\nimportance of this date. Gripping the binder with both hands, he\ngrasped all at once that it was not his costume that should match\nWilliam's incomparability; it was the binder's contents: Wallaby.\nThis was not just his life in his hands, it was his love. And it\nwas perfect.\n\nWilliam's secretary returned with a tray of coffee, tea, and\npastries. She placed the tray on the table, and Matthew asked her\nfor a glass water.\n\n\"What's the matter? No more city fuel?\" William said as he poured\nhimself a cup of steaming coffee.\n\n\"Haven't touched the stuff in over two years.\"\n\n\"Next thing you'll tell me is that you're into flotation tanks\nand sushi.\"\n\n\"The sushi part, yes,\" Matthew said with a light laugh.\n\n\"How's Greta?\" William asked, sipping his coffee.\n\n\"Oh, she's fine, thank you.\" Matthew accepted the glass of water\nand finished half of it in one drink.\n\n\"And how does she like California living?\"\n\n\"She likes it. She keeps quite busy.\"\n\n\"Sounds nice.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Matthew said, setting the glass down. He placed his\nbriefcase on the table. With the mention of his wife, he thought\nfor an instant of what he had hidden inside his briefcase. Since\nhe had placed it there, he had never once taken it out again and\nlooked at it. Would he ever?\n\n\"Let's get started,\" William said. \"I got your e-mail, and I'm\npleased to hear everything went well with your executives and\nboard. It hasn't been easy on my end. My advisers keep scratching\ntheir heads, thinking their boss has gone crazy, especially after\nyour introduction last week. They want us to build something to\n'blow the doors off the Joey Plus,' as my technology adviser puts\nit. But, to his dismay, I've not approved any new development,\nother than revisions and enhancements, since you and I had our\nfirst meeting.\"\n\nMatthew was pleased with this confirmation of the Joey Plus's\nsuccess. It meant that to William and ICP, Wallaby, and he,\nMatthew, were even more valuable now than when they had first met\nto discuss their secretive pact.\n\n\"I'll tell you,\" William said, indicating the binder with his\neyes, \"I'm glad I can finally reveal our plan to my board of\ndirectors and the executive staff. As I've assured you already,\nthey will vote unanimously in favor of our plan. They'll have no\nchoice.\"\n\n\"Here it is. The complete strategy, as outlined.\" Matthew handed\nthe binder to William, who opened it in his lap and was silent\nfor a few moments as he browsed through the various sections.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" he said, \"this is a trade after all.\" He lifted a\nfolder from the table and handed it to Matthew. \"Here are all the\nconnectivity specifications for the 990 series, as well as the\nfile compatibility specs for the BP series.\"\n\nMatthew took the slim nearly weightless folder in his hands and\nall of the sudden felt a bit let down. The folder felt like\nnothing compared to the binder he had just turned over. No girth.\nNo satisfaction. No substance between his fingers. This\ninformation would go to Alan Parker and his engineering\norganization, and perhaps to them it was attractive, but Matthew\nalready missed the extensive, intricately organized volumes in\nthe thick binder now in William's possession. The exchange felt\nuneven, unbalanced. Unfair.\n\n\"I especially like your idea of calling our plan a 'strategic\nalliance,' \" William said. \"Tell me more about how you plan to\nhandle the announcement.\"\n\nMatthew stood up and removed his jacket. \"I think what we should\ndo is announce our relationship in three months, when we have a\nworking prototype of the Joey II, which will be the first Wallaby\nportable computer that's compatible with your computers.\"\n\nWilliam nodded, crossed his legs, and continued to browse through\nthe lengthy document, glancing now and then at Matthew.\n\n\"We'll announce that we're working together on strategic\nconnectivity products from an engineering, marketing, sales, and\ncustomer service standpoint. We'll reveal that you and I met,\nseveral months ago - and by the way, my executive staff and board\nare aware of today's meeting - and you will explain ICP's\nelection for Wallaby Joey II systems as an alternative to your\nown portable computer, and that you will continue to support the\nolder ICP BP computer, as well as facilitate co-sales with our\npeople for Joey II computers. And finally, once you begin the\nmerger process, we'll determine Wallaby's value, and you'll\nfollow up about a year later with the acquisition announcement.\"\n\nWilliam snapped the binder closed. \"Excellent.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Matthew agreed under his breath as he seated himself. He\nfelt a little dizzy. Perhaps the building's height and the change\nin environment were getting to him. He wanted to finish this\nmeeting and get back down on the ground as soon as possible.\n\n\"It's exactly how I had envisioned it, but better,\" William said.\n\"You've managed to smooth the transition with the alliance\naspect, so we're careful to unveil our deal a little at a time.\"\n\n\"That's the idea.\"\n\n\"Very good.\" William placed his cup and saucer on the table.\nRubbing his hands together he sat a little more upright. \"Now,\nthere is one small detail that I'm curious about. Have you spoken\nwith Peter Jones?\" His eyes locked on Matthew's.\n\n\"No,\" Matthew said, barely able to contain his surprise.\n\n\"I see,\" William said. \"Has there been any communication between\nthe two of you? A letter? An e-mail?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\n\"Why do you ask? Is there a concern?\"\n\n\"Well, it's more a curiosity than a concern really. Nothing to\nworry about. What's he doing now?\"\n\n\"He's been in seclusion in Maine, at his vacation home. He still\nowns a large amount of Wallaby stock,\" Matthew added in an\nattempt to reassure the other man.\n\n\"Yes, well, that's no guarantee, is it.\" William said. It was not\na question. He removed his glasses and lightly massaged his\neyelids. \"What I'm wondering about is the same thing I was\ncurious about when I first contacted you, proposing this\nventure.\"\n\n\"Which is?\" Matthew asked, fully knowing the reason before\nWilliam delivered the words.\n\n\"My biggest - \" William started, but then paused abruptly to\nselect his choice of words. \"My initial motivation for wanting\nWallaby was, of course, Jones's product in the pipeline, the\nJoey. And what is the Joey, really, but the physical evidence of\nJones's vision? So naturally, I'm curious about what he's up to,\nnow that he's not spending his time at Wallaby.\"\n\nThis concern had never occurred to Matthew, and apparently his\nexpression said as much.\n\n\"Matthew, don't worry, it's not going to change our arrangement,\"\nWilliam said. \"We want Wallaby, and especially the Joey\ntechnology.\"\n\nJoey technology. Peter's invention. Matthew was at once overcome\nby a wave of jealousy and loathing. When would Wallaby be\nconsidered his? Once Wallaby was merged with ICP, would people\nstill call it \"the company founded by Peter Jones?\" Would he,\nMatthew, be forgotten, like some sort of middle man?\n\nWilliam poured Matthew another glass of water. As he accepted it,\nWilliam said, \"There's no way you can persuade Jones to return to\nWallaby?\"\n\n\"That seems unlikely,\" Matthew said calmly, but what he really\nwanted to say, to shout, was that Wallaby was his now, and Peter\nJones was gone for good.\n\n\"I see.\" William nodded and closed the binder, shutting with it\nany further discussion of Peter Jones. \"When do you fly back?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow.\"\n\nWilliam tapped the binder. \"I'm going to have to spend some time\nwith this before I'll have any questions for you.\" He glanced at\nhis watch. \"Do you have any other meetings while you're here?\"\n\n\"None. I allotted a full day for us, and intended to go back\ntomorrow. However, if we're through, I'll go back tonight, and\nyou can contact me when you're ready.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" William said, rising. He offered a few words of\nreassurance. \"It's all coming along well, Matthew.\" They shook\nhands outside William's office, and Matthew exited the suite.\n\nPressing the down elevator button, he noticed his hand was a\nlittle unsteady. Now that their meeting was through, he was\ngrateful to be leaving New York City a day sooner than planned.\n\"Come on,\" Matthew whispered, pressing the button again and\nagain.\n\nAs he stood brooding over William's surprise concern for Peter\nJones, waiting for what felt like an eternity for the elevator to\narrive, he absently chewed his thumbnail, wishing in earnest for\nthings to move more quickly.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\"Hey, where're you off to so early?\" Kate said, lifting her head\nfrom the pillow.\n\nClimbing into his jeans, Peter nearly tripped himself in his\npants legs as he turned to face her.\n\n\"Oops, sorry,\" he whispered, \"I was trying to be quiet.\" He knelt\nnext to the bed and kissed her. Her eyelids fluttered,\nwakefulness coming slowly. \"Would you mind if we took a rain\ncheck on our trip to Boston today?\" Her hair lay spread around\nthe pillow, and he combed it with his fingers, smoothing it\naround her head.\n\nShe opened her eyes and shook her head, then smiled slowly,\njoyfully.\n\n\"Why the big grin?\"\n\nShe lifted a hand from beneath the comforter and gently knocked\nher knuckles on his head. \"Circus is in town,\" she said, cupping\nhis chin.\n\n\"Well, I've been thinking,\" Peter said, running fingers through\nhis hair.\n\n\"Mm hmm.\"\n\n\"When Byron and I talked the other night, you know, outside, I\nstarted thinking about some things.\"\n\n\"You don't say?\" she said, with mock surprise. \"Like when I kept\ntrying to talk to you yesterday at the park and you were in\nanother zone?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said, nodding, \"then too. I started coming up with a\nconcept I think he could help me work through. There's something\nmissing, a link I guess, and if I talk to him about it he'll\nprobably be able to help me come up with some ideas.\"\n\n\"Hey, you're going to be busy, it sounds like. Maybe I should\njust go down to Boston myself, then home. That okay?\"\n\n\"If it's okay with you. I mean, if you want. I'm sorry,\" he said,\nplanting his hands on either side of her head and looking into\nher eyes. \"I just have to talk to him about this.\"\n\n\"Petey, I'm ecstatic you want to see Byron this morning. I'll be\nback next weekend. If, that is, you'll still want to see me.\"\n\n\"You're a goof sometimes.\" He thanked her with a kiss, then went\nback to getting dressed.\n\n\"Hey,\" she said, propping up on one elbow as he slipped on his\ndock shoes.\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"Who's calling who a goof?\" She tossed a pillow at him. \"You're\ninside-out, Einstein.\"\n\nHe looked down at his shirt, pulled it over his head, reversed\nit, and put it back on. \"Thanks,\" he said, then leaned over and\nkissed her good-bye.\n\n\"Don't mention it.\"\n\nOn his way out of the house he stopped in the kitchen and wrote\n\"I'm a lucky guy,\" on a little yellow Post-it note. He signed it\nwith a tiny heart and pressed it onto the coffee machine.\n\nHe walked the short distance to the Holmes house quickly, his\nthoughts turning round and round. With the tourist season over,\nthe town was somber and cool. Here and there a car occupied the\ndriveway of one of the homes along the inlet, and even fewer\nboats remained docked. He arrived at the Holmes place just as\nGrace was coming around from the side of the house carrying a\npotted plant in her hands. \"This one isn't going to make it,\" she\nsaid, holding the sickly plant up for him to see.\n\n\"Sure isn't,\" Peter said. \"Is Byron here?\"\n\n\"He's in back,\" she said. Then, with a smile, she confided, \"I'm\nglad you came by. Yesterday he was mumbling about some idea he\nsaid he's got to talk to you about. He was going to head over to\nyour house in a little bit. He'll be glad you're here.\"\n\nPeter rounded the house and trotted down the dock. He could see\nthe top of Byron's white-haired head. \"Hey,\" he said, leaping\nfrom the dock to the boat.\n\n\"I see you got your boat shoes on,\" Byron said, looking up from\nhis work, as he finished oiling the boat's teakwood bulwarks.\n\"Good,\" he said, making a few last wipes. \"You're ready to sail.\"\n\n\"If you say so.\"\n\n\"I say so. You saved me a short walk, you know, 'cause I was\ngoing to come over and talk to you today after I took a little\nsail.\" He replaced the lid on the can of oil and tossed the\nsodden rags in a plastic bag, stuffed both into a canvas sack.\n\"Here, stow this, son,\" he said, pointing to an open bin just\ninside the cabin. Peter caught the small sack and put it away.\nThe boat's teakwood and brass cabin was clean, classy, elegant,\nand sharp - much like its captain, Peter thought.\n\n\"Cast off,\" Byron told him, indicating the boat's mooring lines.\n\nPeter jumped to the dock and unwrapped the lines from the cleats.\nThe engine churned alive. \"Now give us a good shove,\" Byron\nordered.\n\nOnce Peter was back on board, Byron applied power and the boat\nlurched once, then smoothed, and they motored for the inlet, the\nwater ahead rolling in small swells, the day clear and crisp.\n\n\"Is it going to be windy enough?\" Peter asked, shading his eyes\nand squinting out at the ocean that lay a half-mile ahead.\n\n\"Here,\" Byron said. He tossed Peter a spare pair of sunglasses.\nPeter put them on and looked again. He could see a few boats in\nthe distance whipping along at a respectable clip, their sails\npuffed fully.\n\n\"Sail much?\" Byron said.\n\nPeter shook his head. He gripped the rail behind him with both\nhands, anchoring himself in a leaning position as he watched\nByron work the wheel.\n\nThe older man smiled and pulled his pipe from his shirt. Holding\nthe wheel steady with his elbows, he expertly applied his lighter\nto the pipe's bowl. \"You'll get used to it,\" he said, pointing\nhis pipe at Peter's rigid knees. \"Just gotta go with the flow.\"\n\nWhen they reached the ocean, Byron began yelling orders to Peter,\nwho followed them with colt-like shakiness. Within minutes the\nmainsail and jib were swollen fully in the eastern wind.\n\nByron shut off the engine, and Peter observed the silence, the\npower of the wind as it pushed the sleek vessel along quickly and\nquietly, as if by magic.\n\n\"Here,\" Byron said, stepping back from the wheel. \"Hold it where\nmy hands are.\"\n\nPeter placed his hands over Byron's, ready. When Byron let go,\nPeter's body gave a slight jerk. \"Just keep her steady,\" Byron\nsaid, returning his hands. He held them there until Peter\nadjusted to the boat's pull.\n\nByron disappeared inside the cabin for a moment, then returned\nwith two cans of beer. He popped the lids and handed one to\nPeter. \"Top of the morning to ya,\" he said, tipping his can to\nPeter.\n\nThe two men shared a couple of minutes of silence between them as\nthey sailed some distance. Peter was the first to speak up. \"I've\ngot an idea,\" he said simply.\n\n\"Me too,\" Byron said. His gaze was focused behind Peter, at the\ndistant shoreline. He took a sip from his beer and gave Peter a\nnod. \"You first,\" he said.\n\n\"Okay. I was thinking about what you said the other night. You\nknow, about our differences, good ones.\"\n\nByron took a thoughtful suck of his pipe and nodded, then\nexpelled a plume of aromatic smoke.\n\n\"So I started thinking,\" Peter went on, his speech coming\nquickly, \"that with your experience in big system stuff, and with\nwhat I know about little system stuff, what if we put our heads\ntogether?\"\n\nByron made a gesture with his pipe for Peter to go on.\n\n\"Okay. See, I've been thinking about portable computers, and PIAs\n- you know, personal information managers. And as much as I think\nthey are helpful, like the Joey, they're not really as helpful as\nthe could be. They don't so much help you, not directly anyway,\nas serve you, so to speak. I mean, they're really just smaller,\nmore tightly-integrated computers than real helpers.\"\n\n\"Mm hmm.\"\n\n\"So, what if there was a way to make a portable computer really\nhelp you? To really assist you, by anticipating your next move.\nBy knowing you better and better the more you work with it?\"\n\nByron took the small metal wind cap off the bowl of his pipe and\nchecked the tobacco. He leaned over the side of the rail and\ntapped it carefully against his weathered palm, spilling the\nblack ashes into the ocean. Then he leaned against the cabin,\ntook a long swallow of his beer, and pushed his sunglasses higher\non his nose.\n\n\"What you're talking about is agents. Agent technology. Little\n'intelligent' software buddies that run on your computer in the\nbackground and pay attention to what you're doing, and what\nyou're not doing, and then act on their own, on your behalf, to\nhelp you by anticipating your next move. Sound about right?\"\n\n\"That's exactly right. We were just starting to play around with\nthe concept before I left. But my lead programmer was really into\nthem, and he had a bunch of friends at MIT who were studying them\nin a big way.\"\n\n\"Right. And what I was thinking about fits in nice with what's\ngot you all juiced. See, all this poppyshit everyone's going on\nabout, the world wide web and the Internet, it's got me a little\nticked off. It's supposed to be the world's greatest 'new'\ninformation source, yet getting connected is a bitch. And what\nwith those snappy little computers you make, well, a person\nshould be able to hook up to the net and web by just plugging in\nthe phone. It's too damn complicated the way it is now. It needs\nto be simpler.\"\n\nPeter jumped in excitedly. \"You know, that's incredible, I was\nthinking that that would be my next step at Wallaby, to make net\nstuff easier for people. And now that you mention it, think about\nthe two. I mean, combining both the net stuff and the agent\nstuff. I've seen demonstrations of net-savvy agents that go off\nand find information and articles you are looking for, seeking\nout news that you know you are interested in, and news that you\ndidn't know you were interested in, but based on your previous\ninterests, the agent finds related items for you. That's what I\ncall a real information assistant.\"\n\n\"Yep, that's a damn good idea,\" Byron agreed . \"And that net\nstuff, you know, is what this old geezer knows best. Hell, I was\ncruising the net while you were doo-dooing in your diapers. That\nwas when the government was the biggest Internet user and text\nand numbers ruled the world. Now I log-in and whew, it's like\nwalking into a virtual playhouse, all the stuff that's on there\nthese days. Just the other day I took Gracie for a 'tour' of\nPrague, thanks to that city's new web page, created by this group\nof expatriates who just up and moved there. It was all there:\nsnapshots, video clips, restaurant and hotel guides, travel\ninformation, the whole works.\"\n\n\"Wow. Sounds like you've really kept up on all this stuff.\"\n\n\"You better believe it. What, you think a guy like me retires and\nthen just unplugs? No siree. And as for those snazzy little\nagents you're all worked up over, I've got a recent report on\nthem back at my office in New York. In particular, the ones with\nnet smarts.\"\n\nPeter smiled and gave an amused shake of his head. \"You know, it\nlooks like you were right. I mean, that you and I have more in\ncommon than I thought.\"\n\nByron shrugged and looked off into the distance for a few\nmoments, then looked Peter in the eye.\n\n\"Guess it's time I fess up,\" Byron said. \"See, I'd been watching\nyou sit in that cafe for a couple of months. I knew who you were.\nI saw the way you looked. I saw the way you didn't look, too, at\nanything around you. It was in your face, that you wanted to be\nleft alone. I knew I couldn't introduce myself to you, not for a\nwhile, anyway. So I waited. Until the other day, when that new\nJoey Plus was introduced. Hell, I figured it was as good a time\nas any to throw a line to a fellow sea dog. All along I've been\nhoping since I saw you the first time that we'd get it on in the\nbrain, like we are now. You know?\"\n\nA beaming grin peeled across Peter's face. \"Yes. I know. And so\nwhat I was really wondering is, do you think maybe we could work\non some of this stuff together?\"\n\nByron scratched his head. \"Sounds like I've got a new hobby,\" he\nsaid. He raised his can of beer. \"Partners?\"\n\nPeter felt a little sting in his eyes. It was the briny ocean\nmist, he told himself, blinking behind his sunglasses to rid his\neyes of the moisture that had abruptly formed there as he touched\nhis beer can to Byron's.\n\n    \"Partners.\"\n\n\nChapter 11\n\n\nHer tears had caused her mascara to run all over the pillow in\nblack streaks. Applied two nights ago, the night of their\nanniversary, her makeup was all gone now from her puffy red eyes.\nShe turned the pillow over, revealing more smears, then reached\nacross the bed for one of Matthew's pillows, which she punched it\ninto shape and stuffed under her head.\n\nAfter rushing home from Jean-Pierre's cottage Saturday night,\nMatthew had noticed neither her absence nor her return. He had\nbeen in his office the whole time, and was still working when she\nwent to bed, where she spent several restless hours alone.\nFinally, unable to lie still, she had gotten up and sat gazing\nout the window, across the pond, to the cottage. A few times she\nhad actually considered going back to him, but she told herself\nthat maybe Matthew would come to bed. Her imagination had\nultimately forced her back to the welcoming pillows, and in a few\nmoments Jean-Pierre had magically come to her, by way of her own\nsleight of hand, stroking her, yes, like that, then sweetness,\nand finally she was satisfied, and then sad, and then guilty. She\nhad cried herself to sleep. A few hours later she was awakened by\nMatthew rustling with his jogging things and again, a little\nlater, by the shower. She had pretended to be asleep while he\ndressed and packed for his trip to New York. She had heard the\ngate bell, indicating the arrival of the limousine that would\ntake him to San Francisco International Airport. She waited, half\nexpecting at any moment to smell his clean scent wafting near, a\nlight kiss on her cheek. But there came no scent, no kiss. Just\nmore of the same indifference, more hurt.\n\nShe had slept until noon, then gone downstairs, in her robe, and\neaten the remainder of last night's dinner for lunch. She put her\ndish in the sink and pulled a clean champagne glass down from the\nshelf and snatched a bottle from the refrigerator. By two in the\nafternoon she was drunk in bed, and crying. She could not bring\nherself to call Jean-Pierre as she had promised, could not bring\nherself to dial the number she had by now committed to memory.\nShe could only cry and doze, cry and doze, all through the\nafternoon. Once more, when it was dark outside, she ventured\ndownstairs for something to eat. She found lasagna in the\nfreezer, which she reheated in the microwave. Afterwards she\nwashed down three Extra Strength Tylenol with champagne from the\nsecond bottle she opened. Retreating once more to her bed, she\npulled the shades on her windows and climbed under the covers.\n\nShe had slept through most of Sunday night in drunken illness,\nand except for using the toilet and descending to the kitchen,\nhad been in bed from Saturday night until now, early Monday\nevening. She wondered if she should get out of bed, or just go\nthrough the night again. Marie had knocked cautiously on her\nbedroom door earlier in the day, asking her if she was feeling\nill. She had told her yes, and told her not to make dinner, that\nshe would find something in the freezer.\n\nShe felt exhausted from thinking and dreaming and worrying about\nher predicament, which only seemed to tighten its hold on her\nheart.\n\nHow could she face Jean-Pierre? She wanted him, yes, but she had\nfelt awful after Saturday night, struggling to understand her\nmotivation, her fantasy of having him. Was she only reacting\nselfishly to Matthew's rejection? Perhaps. But that was what hurt\nthe most, facing the fact that she had lost Matthew.\n\nAnd every time she thought about this, she thought about her own\nvery personal loss, and the irony of it all. It had been her\nupper hand, she mused, with which she had originally attracted\nMatthew, the young marketing manager on the rise among the ranks\nof International Foods.\n\nAfter their initial meeting at ICP's Orange Fresh advertising\nphoto shoot, Matthew had asked Greta to dinner, where he\nexcitedly told her there was talk of his promotion. Yet, during\ndinner, his confidence seemed to weaken. When he told her about\nsome of his ideas, she expressed genuine interest and\nfascination, to which he brightened. She could plainly see that\nhe was a rising star, yet his mood had vacillated wildly between\nconfidence and insecurity in the span of time between the first\ncourse and the dessert. After their first dinner date, a pattern\nthen developed. As often as possible they would dine together,\nand sometimes he would invite her to spend the night with him.\nWhat she never seemed to notice was that he only asked her to\nstay during periods in his career when he was lacking in\nconfidence about a particular campaign or promotion. It was\nduring their evenings together that he had first introduced her\nto his unusual sexual tastes. Almost every time she would end up\nmasturbating them at the same time, him with her left hand, and\nherself with her right. He always complained that he was too\ntired for intercourse, but if she wanted, they could do it that\nway, his way. He was a young, busy executive on the fast track,\nwho had spent all of his prime years working hard at his career.\nClearly he was going to be very successful, and if this was the\nprice she had to pay, she concluded, then for the time being it\nwas worth it. She wanted him.\n\nA year later they married. She continued to pull him from the\nemotional fluxes that arose whenever he started to lose his\nnerve, especially when he was deciding whether or not to go to\nWallaby, and then later, when he faced his first confrontation\nwith Peter Jones. In the few of months that had followed Peter's\nouster, Matthew had come to her less and less with his dilemmas,\nsuddenly, miraculously confident in all aspects of his work.\n\nAs much as she wanted to deny it, she had finally, in the last\ntwenty-four hours, forced herself to admit that the essential\nseparation had happened the day of her accident onboard the yacht\nwhen they were celebrating the success of Orange Fresh.\n\nAnd after last week's introduction of the new Joey thing, she had\nsensed the last of her power of persuasion slipping from her\ngrasp. This past Friday night was the worst. He had gotten home\nlater than usual, and when she had asked him how his day had\ngone, hoping for a hint of something special for their\nanniversary the following day, he had told her all about his\nmeeting with his executive staff, that they had granted their\nsupport to work closely with ICP. This was just the beginning, he\ntold her excitedly. How many times had she heard that? When the\ntruth was that their marriage had ended long ago, when, drunk on\nthe very potion that had earned him esteem, she had gone\noverboard, landing in the lagoon with a bloody splash. Yes, that\nwas when she had lost him, lost them.\n\nAnd that, she knew, was the real reason why she could not bring\nherself to call Jean-Pierre. Now, for probably the twentieth\ntime, she picked up the telephone and merely stared morosely at\nthe green digits glowing enticingly before her. She had memorized\nthe phone number, not by digits, but by the pattern of tones that\nshe played over and over with her index finger. Each time she\npressed every digit in his phone number except the last, the\nsix-note Touch Tone song deepening her dilemma because it\nreminded her of one of International Foods' stupid little\ncommercial jingles for soda pop or corn chips. And, of course,\nthe real reason was that when she dialed, she had to look at her\nhands, which, since the accident, had never been seen or held by\nanother person unless they were gloved, and even then she would\nonly offered the right one. She too had learned how to avoid\nseeing the left one. By diverting her eyes she only ever caught a\nflesh-colored flash, nothing more.\n\nShe tossed her head into the pillows. Maybe he would understand.\nMaybe it was not as grotesque as she imagined. Should she simply\ngo to him, as she had the other night, and try to explain her\nproblem to him?\n\nNo. She could not, not now. She was too drunk and tired, and had\nnot showered in two days. But she could be with her fantasy of\nhim, she thought with painful longing.\n\nShe turned off the bedside lamp and reached inside her robe,\ntouched her breast. If she was going to consider herself\ngrotesque, she thought drunkenly, she might was well begin to\nassociate the act with the cause. That way, perhaps she would\neventually banish him from her mind out of sheer disgust. As if\nto punctuate this point, she removed the gloves upon her retreat\nto bed on Saturday night, and for the first time she could\nremember, she had skipped her nightly ritual of creaming her\nhands with moisturizing lotion. Already, she told herself, she\ncould feel them drying out. She switched hands and used the left.\n\nBefore she got any further, she froze.\n\nA sound, outside.\n\nShe strained to listen...heard the wind through the trees, but\nnothing else.\n\nJust when she was ready to discount the noise as her mind playing\ntricks on her, she heard it again. Closer this time, as though\njust outside on the ground level, below the terrace.\n\nExcept for the faint light from the downstairs foyer lamp that\nbled up through the open bedroom doorway, she was in nearly\ncomplete darkness. The lamp, she thought, turn on the lamp.\nShakily, she stretched to her night table, and, unmindful of the\nchampagne bottles, her hand blindly knocked one to the floor. It\nlanded with a solid thud.\n\nSilence.\n\nShe hunkered down onto her hands and knees beside the bed to\nretrieve the bottle. It was the empty one, and it gave her an\nidea. She hefted it in her hand, considered its weight. Could she\nuse it to protect herself?\n\nShe heard the sound again, louder. Closer. A scratching noise,\nalong on the side of the wall where the ivy clung to the trellis\nand covered the huge stone pillars supporting the terrace.\n\nIt was probably nothing, she tried to assure herself. A cat. Or\njust the wind, she ventured. But then why if it was only a cat,\nshe asked herself, was she holding her breath and the neck of a\nchampagne bottle so tightly in her fist? She crouched beside the\nbed and stared hard at the drawn cotton curtain hanging before\nthe French doors. Silver blue moonlight shone through the sheer\nfabric, picking up the shadows from nearby trees that swayed to\nand fro in the easy breeze.\n\nWhat to do, what to do, she wondered with growing panic. Run\ndownstairs and get a knife from the kitchen? Call the police? Why\ndidn't they have a gun?\n\nDeciding on the second option, she reached for the phone. The\nnumber. What was the phone number? Drunk and scared, she\nstruggled to remember the something-something-one number in her\nhead, but no rhyme came. Instead, Jean-Pierre's phone jingle\nbleep-bleeped over and over in her mind.\n\nThe scraping sound again, much closer. As close as the edge of\nthe concrete terrace wall.\n\nThe dial tone questioned loudly. She pressed the zero button and\nwaited a moment before realizing her error. She remembered the\nnumber: 411. She smashed her thumb down on the disconnect button\nand redialed.\n\nA large form settled heavily on the platform just beyond the\ndoor, a human form silhouetted against the curtain.\n\nA voice from the handset: \"What city please?\"\n\nGreta gasped and swallowed a dry lump in her throat as she\nrealized her second error. Dear God, she had dialed wrong again.\nNo, she had remembered wrong. Not 411!\n\n \"What city please?\" the voice repeated.\n\nNine! 911! Yes! That was it, ask her to connect you -\n\nBut before she could speak the line click-clicked, disconnected.\n\n\"Wait!\" she hissed, straining to be both heard and quiet at once.\n\nDial tone.\n\nA soft knock on the French doors.\n\nShe punched the correct sequence into the phone.\n\nThe knock again, more loudly now.\n\nShe looked outside. The silhouette crouched.\n\n\"Woodside Police emergency services. Can I help you?\"\n\n\"Greta?\" His raspy French accent from the terrace.\n\n\"Oh,\" she murmured into the phone, snapping her eyes shut for a\nmoment.\n\n\"Hello? Can I help you?\" the phone voice repeated.\n\nShe placed the phone back on its cradle and breathed a fatigued\nsigh. She would have to make no decision now. He had decided for\nher. And it was the right decision. Clutching her robe tightly\naround her, she got to her feet and went to the closed door. All\nat once she halted, remembering that she had not showered or even\nbrushed her hair. But her greatest negligence during her\ntemporary invalidation was that she had even let her hands go\nunconditioned. And ungloved. She leaned closer to the drawn\ncurtains.\n\n\"Jean-Pierre?\"\n\n\"Greta. Yes.\" The shadow of his head leaned closer, just inches\naway. \"Open the door.\"\n\n\"Jean-Pierre. I can't. I look just awful,\" she said. \"You can't\nsee me like this. I've been so upset. In bed for two days.\"\n\n\"Greta,\" he crooned softly. \"You did not call me yesterday. Nor\ntoday. I have been waiting, but could wait no longer. I thought\nMatthew may have come home early, so I sat nearby and watched for\na while. I know he is not here. Let me in, Greta.\"\n\nThe thought of Jean-Pierre sitting in his bedroom, or just\noutside the gate, watching for signs of Matthew being home made\nher feel suddenly roguish and sexy. Desired.\n\n\"Jean-Pierre, it's been so awful staying here. I wanted to come\nsee you, but I could not bring myself to do it.\"\n\n\"I am here. I brought you something. Now let me in,\" he\ncommanded, his voice much louder.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said and unlatched the door.\n\nHe stepped inside the room and gripped her shoulders. Night air\nand animal and maleness flooded her senses. She gasped all of it\nin, then her breath was cut off by his lips. He kissed her, hard,\nand snapped his head away. \"Matthew. When?\"\n\n\"He won't be back until tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She looked past his shoulder, outside the doors, and began\nto cry softly.\n\nHe frowned and pulled her down beside him on the bed. \"Greta,\nwhat is it?\" He wiped her cheeks with his thumbs.\n\n\"I've been so upset and confused by everything. This is so hard\nfor me.\" She closed her eyes and dropped her forehead against his\nshoulder. Her mind flashed with images of the first time he had\nkissed her, in the horse stall.\n\n\"You mustn't cry.\" He kissed her again. His hands touched just\ninside her soft robe. Lightly, down to her belly. Gooseflesh\nprickled her forearms, spread to her stomach, her loins. Her\nnipples felt pinched and hard, needed pinching.\n\n\"Wait,\" she said, squeezing his strong forearms. \"I've been in\nbed for two days. I really must take a shower.\"\n\n\"Mmm,\" he hummed. \"Never mind that.\" In one quick motion he slid\nthe robe from her shoulders and undid the belt, parting the\ngarment at her waist. Pushing her down, he crouched over her,\nfacing her, supporting his weight on either side with his knees.\nHis jeans-clad thighs rubbed lightly against her own. She had\nimagined and wanted this moment for so long. However she could\nnot be with him here like this until she had a quick shower.\n\n\"Please,\" she said, squirming from beneath him. \"I'll just be a\nfew minutes,\" she said, and darted from his lunging grasp to the\nbathroom.\n\nThere, she looked at herself in the mirror. With horror, she\nremembered that her hands were ungloved. She let her eyes go\nfirst to her right hand, then the left. She forced her vision to\nstay there until she could breathe again. Yes, she would have to\ntell him. And show him.\n\nA few minutes later she emerged from the bathroom wearing a towel\naround her midsection. Jean-Pierre was lying on the bed propped\non one elbow, naked. Timidly, she proceeded to the bedside. He\nraised himself to his knees and placed his hands on her hips.\nBefore she could take in the shape and size of his nakedness, he\nhad her on the bed in one quick movement, the towel discarded\nwith a flick of his wrist.\n\nHe breathed a lusty sigh and lowered his lips to hers. She felt\nhis hard, blazing length along her entire body. She wanted to\nlook at him next to her like this, but before she could take in\ntheir togetherness, he kissed her again, gently this time,\nteasingly. She expected that in any second he would enter her,\nhave her.\n\nBut instead he gently clasped her hands in his own. \"Your hands,\nGreta, this is the first time I have felt them.\"\n\n\"Feel them. Both of them. Go on.\"\n\nIt took him a moment to register. \"Oh, Greta. Is this why you\nhave been afraid?\"\n\nShe began to cry again. \"It's so horrible. I was once a hand\nmodel, and then that happened. And everything ended.\"\n\nHe said nothing. He kissed her, told her softly to cry and let it\nout. \"What happened, Greta? You must tell me. There is nothing\nbad about it to me.\"\n\nWhen she stopped crying she wiped her eyes and sat up, allowing\nhis hands to remain on hers through the entire story, which she\nrecounted in a quiet monotone.\n\n\"We were on a yacht anchored in a windy lagoon, celebrating a new\nsoda of Matthew's that was a huge success. I'd had a lot to\ndrink. At one point I was standing off to the side all by myself.\nI was poking my ring finger in the little hole of an empty can,\nthinking about how Matthew and I were going to start a family.\nApparently we were getting ready to sail some more. It was dark.\nI remember they were taking Matthew's picture just a few feet\naway. The flashes popped and at the same time a strong wind\nrocked the boat. I lost my balance and reached out to grab the\nrail but I was blinded by flashes and couldn't see. My finger was\nstill in the can and I had no time to shake it off before\ngrabbing on to stop myself from falling. I felt rope and metal\nand pain all at once. I had grabbed between the support line and\nthe rail, and the can was caught between that and my hand. I\nthink that was when I started to scream. I was leaning forward\ntrying to free my hand when the boat lurched. I fell overboard.\nMy finger didn't come with me. Matthew was standing at the rail\nof the boat, screaming hysterically. Someone jumped in. It was\ndark, but I saw the blood then, and when I reached for the life\npreserver I saw what had happened. The little white nub of bone.\nThe rest of it gone. I passed out and woke up in the hospital.\nThey said that the can with my finger and my wedding band had\nfallen overboard with me. They never found it. It's still out\nthere in the ocean, lost, Matthew and I with it.\"\n\nThey were silent for a very long time. She did not cry anymore,\nshe only lay there with her head turned on the pillow, eyes\nclosed, waiting for him to let go of her hand. But he did not let\ngo. Instead he kissed her right hand, then the left one, each\nknuckle. She was frozen in place as he did this, as he kissed\nbetween her pinkie and the middle finger, at the space where her\nring finger once was. She gasped when she felt his tongue there.\n\nHolding the hand, he leisurely traced along her breasts with her\nown fingertips. He trailed their course with his lips and tongue,\ntaking tiny nips at one breast, then the other. He squatted over\nher, his knees on either side. His ponytail fell forward into her\nface and she let some of the gathered hair enter her mouth as he\nsucked her breasts with growing urgency. Her hips responded. She\nlifted herself against him, pressed his head harder into her\nchest. He held both of her breasts, licked beneath them. She felt\na chilling tingle along the back of her neck each time the fine\nhairs of his buttocks brushed against her thighs. Gripping him\nbeneath his armpits, she squeezed his strong chest between her\nhands and pulled him fully down onto her with all of her might.\n\n\"Slowly,\" he whispered, resisting her insistence. \"There is no\nhurry.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she moaned, nearly in tears. \"Yes, hurry, I want you so\nbad.\" Never before had she been kept on edge like this, all of\nher energy wriggling beneath him, wanting him. It had always been\nMatthew wanting her when he needed, and she had always been there\nto service him. But this was not like that.\n\nAnd then she felt a new emotion that was both exciting and\nfrightening. \"I need you,\" she mouthed without a sound into the\npillow. Her inhibitions lifted and, as if beyond her control, she\nfelt her entire self slacken, acceptance at last releasing her\nanxiety.\n\nSensing her sacrifice, he pressed his whole hard body against\nher, claiming her entirely from head to toe. His hot sex lay\nrigid between them, ready to consummate their bond.\n\nWith a lustful moan of anticipation he lay on his side and took\nher hand again. He kissed her wrists, her lips, her throat,\ntraced her fingers along his ample sex, beneath his scrotum,\nwhich lay swollen over her hotness. She attempted to wrap her\nhand around it entirely, attempted to gently cup and fondle his\ntesticles, but his control was beyond her own, and so she let him\nlead her maddeningly, pleasurably, on an erotic discovery of\ntheir bodies.\n\nWith his penis in both their hands, he played its tip along her\nfolds, as far up to her navel, back again, and down and around\nthe edge of her anus. In an instant he was inside her with his\nfingers. Then he removed his and encouraged hers in. At first she\npulled away, her entire arm taut in his grip. He eased her\nresistance with a kiss that was both tender and probing, secure.\n\"Shhh,\" he whispered, gently pressing her fingers inside her. She\nyielded, pressed a breast to his mouth as they alternated their\nexploration of her innermost region. Gently he withdrew his hand\nentirely, and watched her as she continued by herself, tuning in\nto her own rhythm.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said encouragingly, caressing between her buttocks with\nhis hand. He changed position so that he could work his tongue\nbetween her fingers. She quickened her rhythm, squeezing his\ntongue with each press and flick. He followed her fingers inside\nwith his tongue and she cried out his name when she felt it slide\nin the gap created by her missing finger. Her free hand flew to\nhis hair and with a moan she freed his ponytail, wanting all of\nhim inside her. His hands rolled and pinched her nipples in time\nwith each lunge of his tongue, propelling her on mercilessly. She\nmoaned deeply, and he pulled back when she drew close.\n\nShe pulled his head up by the hair and crushed his lips with a\nkiss. She opened her legs and slid them up, pressing her knees\ninto his flanks. Then she led him in, pulling her hand from\nbetween them. He alternately kissed her and her hand, the stubby\nknuckle. With each of his thrusts he kissed her, and it felt\nmarvelously good and wicked at the same time, feeling him inside\nher and holding her hand and kissing her. With each lunge he\nsqueezed more tightly, as they inched closer, until his\nunflagging rhythm suddenly altered to forceful, jutting bursts.\nWith each hot gush inside her, she cried out his name, her hand\ntwitching spasmodically in his as she was overcome by wave after\nwave of irrepressible pleasure.\n\nAfter their breathing returned to almost normal he took her in\nhis arms, their steaming bodies sticking together as they lay\nentangled, too exhausted to move. Her head was spinning from the\nchampagne and from their intoxicating lovemaking.\n\nNever before had she felt like this, she thought, feeling him\nstill inside her, softening. Matthew had always been the one to\nwant, and she had always given to him, but now she understood all\nat once her desire to be given to.\n\nTheir hands remained clasped together as she drifted away from\nher thoughts, the tingling inside her turning to numbness as she\ncooled, cooled, then felt chilled, as though she were shaking.\n\nBeing shaken.\n\n\"Greta!\" Jean-Pierre whispered.\n\n\"Mmm?\" she moaned, disoriented.\n\n\"Matthew!\"\n\nNot Matthew, she thought half-consciously. No, not Matthew. Not\nfor a while. Only Jean-Pierre now.\n\n\"Matthew!\" Jean-Pierre hissed again, leaping from the bed.\n\nShe sat up, wide-eyed. It was dark in the room. She turned on the\nbeside lamp. Jean-Pierre was hastily gathering his strewn\nclothes. No, he didn't understand. They were safe. Touching her\nhand to her head for an instant, she relaxed a little, felt a\nlittle laugh begin in her chest at the comedy of his panic. He\nmust have heard Marie, because Matthew wouldn't be home from his\nNew York trip until tomorrow afternoon.\n\nBut then she heard his voice, \"Greta?,\" faintly, coming from\ndownstairs.\n\nJudging by the echo she guessed that he was in the kitchen - and\nonly one minute away from making his way through the foyer, up\nthe stairs, and into their bedroom. \"My God!\" she gasped,\nstruggling with her robe. \"Hurry! Leave!\"\n\nJean-Pierre had managed to pull on his pants, shirt, jacket.\nSnatching up his shoes and socks and wristwatch, he stepped\noutside, onto the terrace. She gathered her robe and tied it\nclosed as she rushed from the room.\n\n\"Matthew?\" she called from the top of the stairs. \"I'm up here,\"\nshe said, composing herself as she descended quickly.\n\n\"There you are,\" Matthew said, his garment bag and briefcase in\ntow. He set down the briefcase at the bottom of the stairs and\nflipped through a few pieces of mail. Yes, she thought\nthankfully, take your time and read your mail, all of it. \"I came\nback tonight instead. My meeting was shorter than I'd expected.\"\nHe glanced at her.\n\nAs if sensing her scrutiny, he stopped going through the mail. He\ndropped it next to his briefcase and began climbing the steps.\n\"Why is it so dark in the house? Are you in bed already?\"\n\nShe stopped and raised her wrist to her head, fumbling with her\nwords. \"I'm not feeling very well,\" she said. She pulled a\ntattered tissue from her pocket, dabbed it beneath her dry nose,\ncoughed. \"Darling,\" she said, blocking his way, \"could you please\nget me a glass of water?\"\n\nHe stopped, eyed her with subdued curiosity. Then he let out an\nimpatient sign and turned and started back down the steps. Just\nanother minute, she thought, and Jean-Pierre would be safely\ngone.\n\nBut then Matthew stopped, turned around, and climbed toward her\nagain. \"There are cups in the bathroom,\" he recalled aloud as he\npassed her. She clutched the hem of her robe and lifted it and\nchased after him in hopes of getting to the bedroom before he\ndid.\n\nShe didn't.\n\nHe flipped on the light switch, which lit up several lamps in the\nroom all at once, and tripled its brightness. Now everything was\nfully illuminated, exposed.\n\nShe tried to see what Matthew was seeing: The bed was a shambles.\nSheets, pillows, and the comforter strewn across the mattress and\nonto the floor. The two empty champagne bottles. One on its side.\nThe bath towel beside the bed. The unlocked terrace door.\n\nHe strode past the bed to his walk-in closet and hung up his\ngarment bag, acting as though he did not notice the mess. Pulling\nhis tie from his collar, he caught her earnest reflection in the\nfull-length closet mirror. He turned around to take a closer look\nat her disheveled appearance, and for a moment his eyes fixed on\nthe empty champagne bottle resting atop the night table. He\ngraced her with a brief, condescending glance, then went back to\nundressing.\n\nA chilly gust of wind blew open the terrace doors and lifted the\ncurtains. He clucked his tongue as he crossed the room to close\nthe doors.\n\n\"Oh\" Greta said sharply, coming up quickly behind him. \"I was so\nhot. I think I have a fever.\"\n\nIgnoring her, he pulled the doors shut.\n\nShe angled her head to see outside. Jean-Pierre seemed to have\ngotten away safely.\n\nMatthew twisted the lock and grabbed the curtains and started to\nslide them together. Suddenly he stopped and crouched a little.\n\"What's that?\" he said, squinting outside.\n\n\"What's what, darling?\" Greta said, hearing her own voice crack\nas she rushed to his side.\n\nMatthew stepped out onto the terrace.\n\n\"This.\" He bent over and picked something up. \"It caught my eye\nin the light,\" he said. From his fingers he dangled a fine gold\nchain, with a sparkling gold object dangling from it. A charm of\nsome sort.\n\nShe scrutinized the object for an instant, then broke into a wide\nsmile. \"Oh, there it is,\" she said, taking the chain in her hand\nand holding it up with a glad smile on her face. \"I've been\nlooking for this for days.\"\n\n\"Hmm. I've never seen that one before,\" Matthew said\nindifferently before disappearing into the bathroom.\n\nAnd neither had she. Her heart was galloping in her chest. She\nsat on the bed and took a quick peek at the charm necklace in her\npalm. Then all at once she remembered Jean-Pierre saying, when\nhe'd arrived, that he had brought her something.\n\nThe bathroom light went out, and she carefully tucked the object\ninto her robe pocket. Assembling the bedclothes as best she\ncould, she pulled the comforter over her legs, then shut off her\nnight lamp.\n\nDressed in his pajamas, Matthew stood at the foot of the bed.\n\"Since you're not feeling well,\" he said, glancing at the\nmascara-streaked pillows, \"I'll sleep in the guest room.\" He shut\noff the remaining lamps as he left the room. When she heard his\ndoor close down the hall, she switched her night lamp on again\nand pulled the necklace from her pocket. She inspected it more\nclosely under the light.\n\nIt was a tiny horseshoe charm. She squeezed the charm tightly\nbetween her palms, feeling him again. Then she clasped the\nnecklace around her neck and turned off the lamp. She pulled the\ncomforter over her body. \"Good night, Jean-Pierre,\" she\nwhispered. She kissed the charm, then squeezed it tightly in her\nleft fist and held it against her breast.\n\nAs her thoughts swirled into pleasant dreams, her grip relaxed,\nthen gently unrolled, and the symbol of Jean-Pierre's love\nslipped through her fingers, and she slept like never before.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nAfter William finished reading through the binder Matthew had\ngiven him earlier in the day, he got up from his reading chair\nand stretched.\n\nThe strategy was perfect. Matthew had put together a plan that,\nafter they announced the Joey II computer in about a year, would\ndemonstrate that Wallaby had grown up and was venturing into the\nbig-business world by working a strategic deal with ICP. Soon\nafter that, before the stock had too much time to climb, Wallaby\nwould be acquired by ICP and become a subsidiary of the huge\ncomputer giant.\n\nWilliam thought for a moment about Matthew and his manner. He\nseemed high-strung and edgy when they had met earlier in the day.\nWhen he had asked about Peter Jones, Matthew had turned\ndefensive. Though William had every intention of following\nthrough with his plans to acquire Wallaby, he wondered if maybe\nhis inquiry had caused Matthew to fear that he was losing\nconfidence in him, and in Wallaby.\n\nWilliam was in fact more than mildly curious about what Jones had\nbeen up to over the past few months. Even though he was still on\nthe payroll at Wallaby and officially an employee, after what\nMatthew had told him, William felt certain that there was little\nhope of Jones ever going back to Wallaby.\n\nAn unhappy thought, for, after all, it was Jones who had invented\nthe Joey, and the older Mate, which was the reason he had even\nstarted formulating the secret acquisition plan a few years ago\nin the first place.\n\nHe wondered: Could Jones be a threat to ICP and Wallaby if he\ndecided to resign and go it alone, perhaps competing head-on with\nhis \"old\" company with a newer product, something more compelling\nthan the Joey?\n\nWilliam knew that Jones had substantial financial reserves, and\ncombined with the venture capital he could gather by simply\npicking up the telephone, he would easily gain the resources\nnecessary to do something big. But in an industry dominated by\nonly a few major players, even Silicon Valley's wunderkind would\nface obstacles at this stage of the game. And of course, William\nreminded himself, suddenly taking down his fear a few notches,\nthe largest obstacle Jones would confront was Jones himself.\nWasn't that why he had originally hired Matthew Locke? He was not\nan organization man, incapable of managing a large company. And\nthat would hurt him. Thank goodness for small wonders.\n\nWith some amusement at the irony of this last thought, William\nplaced the binder beside his Joey, with which tomorrow morning he\nwould compose an e-mail message to Matthew, congratulating him on\nhis work. He was too tired now, and his elation had turned to\nexhaustion. He needed a good night's sleep. He glanced at\nMartha's picture for a moment, then shut off his desk lamp.\n\nThe ring of the telephone startled him. He reached across his\ndesk to answer it before the second ring, noticing the time on\nhis wall clock. Quarter past midnight.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"Billy, did I wake you?\" a croaky voice asked.\n\n\"Who's calling, please?\"\n\n\"I knew it! Working late as usual. How's the ol' boss?\"\n\n\"Byron! I'm fine. How are you and Grace?\"\n\n\"A-okay. We're staying for an extra while here in Maine.\nSailing's been good. Few more weeks left.\"\n\n\"Great to hear.\"\n\n\"I'm calling for a favor,\" Byron said.\n\n\"Shoot.\"\n\n\"I need some of my old stuff from my office there in New York.\"\n\nAs the most prominent inventor in ICP's history, Byron was\ngranted lifelong privileges that included an office that was\ncleaned every day and kept in a ready state, should he ever\ndecide to drop by and sit in, for whatever reason.\n\n\"Sure. What kind of stuff?\" William said and smiled to himself.\nHis honorable former partner was experiencing post-retirement\npangs. He probably wanted to browse through his old journals,\nnotes, take a trip down memory lane, as it were.\n\n\"On my shelf, right behind my desk, there's a binder called\n'Advanced Network Agent Design.'\"\n\nWilliam snapped on the desk lamp and wrote himself a note.\n\n\"I'll have Barbara send it to you. Anything else?\"\n\n\"No. I mean, no, I don't want you to send it to me. I want you to\nsend it to this address,\" Byron said.\n\nWilliam heard some papers shuffling.\n\n\"Here it is: 42 Inlet Drive, Camden, Maine, 04288.\"\n\n\"You got it, Byron. I'll have Barbara fetch it tomorrow and\nexpress it to you so you get it by Wednesday. Oh, wait a second,\nwho's the addressee?\"\n\n\"Peter Jones.\"\n\nWilliam's eyes shot to Martha's photo. He blinked rapidly and his\nlips parted. But no words would come out. He shut his mouth, took\na deep swallow. Heard himself repeat the addressee's name, then\nfor a few beats he heard his own blood pounding in his ears.\n\n\"Yep, new buddy of mine. You know who he is, right?\"\n\nWilliam took a few seconds to answer. \"Of course,\" he said,\nstaring at his Joey. Then, struggling to sound as matter-of-fact\nas possible: \"Why are you sending him this?\"\n\n\"We're kicking around an idea we've come up with,\" said Byron,\nall snappy and playful.\n\n\"I see,\" William managed. \"Byron, are the two of you thinking of\nstarting up something new?\"\n\n\"Hell, I don't know. It may be nothing. But it may be something,\ntoo. Listen, I don't want to talk your ear off. It's late, and\nyou've got a real job to go to in the morning.\"\n\n\"It's okay. I was just reading.\"\n\n\"Well, if you've got a few minutes.\"\n\n    \"I do. Really. The time doesn't matter,\" William said, and\nshakily seated himself in his chair. He reached over to the\nbookshelf and lifted Martha's photo. He placed it in his lap.\n\n\"Please, go on,\" he said, and for the next forty-five minutes, he\nlistened.\n\n\n\nPART III\n\n\nChapter 12\n\n\nFour months had passed since William Harrell and Matthew Locke\nhad traded secrets in New York...and since Matthew and Laurence\nMaupin had met on her bed.\n\nThey were together again now, backstage at Lincoln Center in New\nYork City, preparing for the announcement of ICP and Wallaby's\nstrategic alliance before an audience of executives from both\ncompanies, and industry partners, customers, and the press.\n\n\"Matthew, you seem a little nervous, and that will show to the\naudience,\" Laurence said, standing before Matthew, who sat\nbackstage in a dressing room. A makeup attendant patted his\nforehead and cheeks with flesh-tone powder.\n\n\"I'm just excited,\" he said.\n\n\"Smile. Make sure you smile,\" Laurence urged, trailing Matthew as\nthey moved along the rear hallway to the stage area. They stopped\nbehind the curtain's edge, and Matthew checked his watch.\n\n\"Hello, Matthew,\" William Harrell said warmly, joining them.\nThough they were dressed similarly, William appeared very cool,\nvery calm, very much in control, the very opposite of how Matthew\nwas feeling.\n\nA man appeared wearing a microphone and earpiece headset. He\nnodded to Laurence then faced Matthew. \"Mr. Locke, you're on in\none minute, as soon as the music stops.\"\n\n\"Good luck,\" William said, shaking Matthew's hand. He stepped\naside, opening a clear path to the stage.\n\nThe auditorium grew silent as the overhead lights dimmed and the\npiped-in classical music dissolved. An announcer's voice greeted\nthe audience and a large screen unrolled, on which a slide\nprojector beamed the Wallaby logo.\n\n\"Good luck,\" Laurence whispered, squeezing his hands. A spotlight\nfocused on the podium gaped wide and bright.\n\nThe announcer boomed: \"Please welcome the Chairman, President,\nand Chief Executive Officer of Wallaby, Incorporated, Matthew\nLocke.\"\n\nApplause sounded when Matthew appeared. He traversed the distance\nto the podium with clear composure and stood before the audience\na few moments, allowing them to take in his dark gray suit, his\nconfident air. He graced the audience with a sweeping smile, then\nfocused his attention at the center of the auditorium, just above\nthe heads of his audience, as his mistress and tutor had taught\nhim.\n\n\"Thank you, and good morning. Today will mark a very important\nday in Wallaby's history. As you know, Wallaby is a company that\nhas always been focused on empowering individuals with portable\ncomputer technology. Many of you today, stowing your own Joey or\nJoey Plus in your briefcases and folios, have first hand\nexperience with Wallaby's products, and today we'd like to take\nthat experience to the next level.\"\n\nIn sync with his speech, the slides Matthew had shown the\nexecutive staff just four months ago, when he first proposed the\nstrategic alliance with ICP, flashed behind him on the high\nscreen.\n\n\"What we are about to show you will enable Wallaby to continue to\ndeliver on its original vision of powerful portable computing,\nbut with more flexibility than ever. That means customers who\nwere previously locked out of the Joey platform because of its\nincompatibility with other systems can finally hop on the\nbandwagon and benefit from the Joey's advanced technology, and\ncontinue to access files and documents created on those other\nsystems, simply and easily.\"\n\nAt this the crowd stirred. It was exactly the kind of reaction\nMatthew had hoped for. Barely able to contain his smile, he\npressed on.\n\n\"Today, Wallaby announces a new and friendly personality in\ncompatible computing.\" The spotlight on Matthew faded to a dim\nglow, and a second circle of light appeared, center stage.\n\n\"But rather than standing here and telling you about our exciting\nnews, why don't I let the new Joey II show you.\"\n\nThe excited audience silenced. On drum roll cue a shrouded,\nremote-controlled box about the size of a shopping cart glided\nfrom stage right to center stage, into the spotlight. The drum\nroll intensified.\n\nThe entire auditorium went black for a few seconds, then cymbals\ncrashed loudly. The shroud was gone, and there, bathed in intense\nlight, was a dark gray prototype Joey II computer.\n\nMatthew himself joined in the thunderous applause. He felt as\nthough an intense wave of heat had just washed over him. For the\nfirst time in Wallaby's history, someone other than Peter Jones\nwas revealing a new product before a cheering audience.\n\nSeconds later the computer's screen, controlled by an automated\nscript, came to life, and its image was projected, via video\noutput, to the overhead screen for all the audience to watch.\n\nThe screen cleared and then the Joey II went into a six-minute\nanimated presentation demonstrating the system's new features,\nincluding a new slot for plugging in a local area network card, a\nlarger hard disk, faster fax sending and receiving, and built-in\nfile translation software for reading documents and other files\ndirectly from ICP's formerly incompatible BP desktop and portable\ncomputers.\n\nWhen it was over, cymbals crashed and the audience applauded\nwildly, thrilling Matthew to the bone. He stole a quick glance to\nhis left, offstage and behind the curtains. Laurence signaled\nwith a thumbs-up gesture.\n\nHe turned back to the audience and waited for the applause to\nfinish.\n\n\"Today you just saw a prototype of the new Joey II computer, the\nfirst engineering collaboration between International Computer\nProducts and Wallaby.\n\n\"When the Joey II is available in six months, Wallaby and ICP\nwill begin a co-selling relationship. For the first time in\nhistory, two former rivals, Wallaby salespeople and ICP\nsalespeople will share and support the same customers.\n\n\"This is a non-financial arrangement, and represents a first-ever\nstrategic alliance between our companies, enabling Wallaby to\ncontinue to develop exciting and powerful portable computers, now\nwith built-in ICP compatibility that makes the Joey II the\nperfect companion to ICP's line of BP desktop computers.\"\n\nThe presentation continued, and Matthew detailed the specific\nmarkets and technologies that each of the companies had agreed to\ndevelop together. Afterward, as Matthew and Laurence were\ncollecting their notes and briefcases, William strolled into the\npress room.\n\n\"Well done, Matthew,\" William said, smiling politely to Laurence.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"May I have a word with you?\" William said. \"It will only take a\nminute.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Matthew said, shutting his briefcase. \"I'll be right\nback, Lauri,\" he said, and followed William from the room.\n\n\"In here,\" William said, pushing into an empty dressing room. The\nlight from the hallway fanned into the room and aided their\nsearch for the wall switch.\n\nFinding none, Matthew switched on one of the makeup tables\nmirrors. Twenty light bulbs lit up around the mirror's rim, and\nhe turned around the chair facing it and seated himself. William\npulled up a small stool and sat down.\n\n\"It all went very well, Matthew,\" William said. \"I just wanted a\nmoment alone with you to tell you how happy I am, especially\nafter the shakiness we've experienced over the past few months.\"\n\n\"Thank you. And I understand. We've both had our own concerns,\nyou on one side, me on the other.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" William agreed. \"I sometimes didn't believe we would make\nit to this day, but we did, and now we're ready to move into the\nfinal phase.\" The final phase: ICP acquires Wallaby, and Matthew\ncomes under William's command. \"And they bought your response\nwith nary a doubt,\" William said. \"That was good. Because they're\ngoing to have a big surprise in a couple of months.\"\n\nHe was referring to the reporter's question that had been\ndirected to Matthew minutes ago: \"With this 'strategic\nalliance,'\" the reporter had said, affecting a difficulty with\nthe definition of the agreement, \"aren't you afraid, Mr. Locke,\nof a possible ICP takeover of Wallaby in the future? Or is this\nperhaps something you may want?\"\n\nDespite the dead-on accuracy of the reporter's speculation,\nMatthew had not wavered in his response, explaining, with a\ndiscernible hint of Peter Jones's once-infamous arrogance, that\ntoday's strategic alliance announcement was as close as Wallaby\nintended to get to ICP. To further squash the theory, he threw in\na nugget about takeovers, and how FTC regulations would prevent\nICP from subsuming Wallaby as long as Wallaby continued to build\nportable computers.\n\nHowever the reason his response had sounded so believable to\neveryone, and to himself especially, because it was the truth.\n\nWas.\n\nRight then, as he had answered the reporter's question, a new\nplan, a revised plan, had crystallized in Matthew's mind: There\nwould be no eventual merger between ICP and Wallaby.\n\n\"It's back to the office for me,\" William said, checking his\nwatch.\n\nMatthew said good-bye and turned to face himself in the mirror.\nHe felt different, felt he looked different. Younger. More alive\nthan ever. He pinched back a smile as he whispered the words he\nwould say if it were Peter rather than himself looking him in the\neye right now: \"I told you so.\" He said it again, and this time\nbroke into a huge self-satisfied grin, his laughing eyes piercing\nback from the mirror into his own.\n\n\"Matthew?\" Laurence stepped into the room. \"Who are you talking\nto? Is everything okay?\"\n\nThis somehow stuck him as funny and he let out a burst of\nlaughter. \"Fine. Great. Super,\" he said. He whisked his fingers\nthrough his hair and inhaled a deep breath.\n\nIronically, he at once understood that Wallaby -  no, that he -\nnow had ICP in a precarious position. William himself had told\nMatthew that he had not approved any new portable computer\ndesigns, banking everything on today's announcement, so that\nultimately he could acquire Wallaby with its now-compatible\ntechnology. The way Matthew saw it, Wallaby - delightfully modest\nand manageable, both in size and volume compared to ICP - now\nheld at least a two-year technology advantage over the world's\nbiggest computer company. And the thought of having them by the\ntail delighted Matthew beyond any dream he ever had of merging\nthe companies as one.\n\n\"Good,\" Laurence said. \"Come on, let's go play in the city.\" She\nshook her rental car keys at him. \"I've got the keys.\"\n\n\"Wrong,\" Matthew said, and with a playful look in his eye\nproduced his hotel room key and twirled it on his finger. \"It\nlooks like I'm holding the only key we'll need.\"\n\n\nChapter 13\n\n\nIt was on days like this, bright and sunny with a slight morning\nchill, that she felt happier than ever. With Matthew in New York\non business, Greta had given the housekeeper the past three days\noff, letting her know that she could handle her own meals. But\nthat was hardly the reason why it was better for Marie to be out\nof the house.\n\nShe gripped the handlebars firmly, admiring her own hands without\nill feelings. The gears of her exercise cycle spun quietly, crisp\nair breezing in through the open balcony doors. Her breathing was\nheavy but controlled, just as he had taught her.\n\nShe heard the shower stop and checked the cycle's timer. Another\nquarter mile before she was through. That would work out almost\nperfectly, giving her a few minutes to cool down before he was\nall finished in the bathroom.\n\nThe cool winter air whispered across her face, and with each\nmisty exhale puffing from her nostrils she imagined the sensual\nair of France, of Europe, so much there for them to see and do\ntogether, an afternoon ride in dewy green hills, pedaling along\nright behind him with his strong back in view, the bobbing of the\nred and white checkered tablecloth peeking out from the picnic\nbasket strapped to his bicycle...\n\n\"Darling, are you going to pedal all the way to Alaska?\"\nJean-Pierre said, glancing at the accumulated mileage on the\ncycle's odometer.\n\nGreta laughed heartily. \"I stopped looking and...I guess...I\njust...kept...going.\"\n\n\"To the hospital is where I'll be going,\" Jean-Pierre said.\nHitching his towel around his waist, he went to the balcony doors\nand closed them. \"With pneumonia!\"\n\n\"Oh, darling, I'm sorry,\" she said, lifting her feet from the\npedals. She dropped her head into her crossed arms over the\nhandlebars and regulated her breathing as she cooled down. The\nmachine's flywheel slowed to a stop and she shook herself\nbriskly. \"I feel so good!\" she shouted.\n\nFor the past four months, since the beginning of their affair,\nshe had exercised every day. Though Jean-Pierre had been the one\nto suggest the calisthenics, she had become obsessed with her\ndaily workout and needed no encouragement to get on her cycle and\ngo every morning. With each strained breath she pictured herself\nbecoming more slender, more youthful, more attractive and\nbeautiful and sexy for him.\n\nClad in undershorts, Jean-Pierre stood combing his long hair\nbefore Matthew's bureau mirror. He swung his head back, collected\nhis mane with both hands behind his head, and worked an elastic\nband over the ponytail.\n\nGreta tugged off her headband and playfully pulled it over his\nhead. \"Now you look like an Indian.\"\n\nHe smiled and tugged the band off. As he reached for his shirt\nhanging on the bedpost, she grabbed his wrist and roughly pulled\nhim beside her on the bed. She flattened his hand against her\nchest, his middle finger settled over the horseshoe charm he had\ngiven her. \"Are you an Indian giver?\" she said suggestively,\nmoving his hand from the charm to her breast.\n\nHe leaned forward and kissed her on the forehead. When her grip\nloosened he stepped back and stood before her with his hands on\nher hips. \"Greta,\" he warned her, \"I must get ready. I have a\nnine o'clock lesson, and already I am going to be late.\"\n\nShe stretched, \"Okay, okay, no pow-wow for now.\"\n\n\"Besides, darling,\" he said to her reflection in the mirror, \"you\ntoo have a busy day ahead of you.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know,\" she said with an unpleasant expression. \"I'll\ncall as soon as I get out of the shower.\"\n\nHe sat beside her, boots in hand. \"Maybe you should call now,\" he\nsaid, \"so I can be here with you.\"\n\n\"After the shower. I promise.\" She stood and unzipped her\nathletic top.\n\nHe tugged on his second boot. \"It is just that they can be so\npushy and overwhelming.\"\n\n\"He is a friend of ours, Jean-Pierre. Well, of Matthew's anyway.\nBut I trust he'll be straight with me,\" she said, sounding not\ntotally certain.\n\n\"I am just trying to help,\" Jean-Pierre said, tucking in his\nshirt.\n\nShe slid her little horseshoe charm back and forth on its chain.\nShould she call now? Perhaps with Jean-Pierre here it would be\neasier. And if she really was going to go through with this, she\nmight as well do it with him here. He was, after all, the reason\nwhy she had made up her mind in the first place.\n\n\"Wait,\" she said, as he was zipping his suede jacket. \"Pass me my\nlittle address book. It's over there next to my wallet.\" She\nflipped through the book and found the number she wanted and\ndialed the telephone.\n\nJean-Pierre stood with his arms crossed, broad shoulders pressed\nsquarely against the wall. He gave her an encouraging look.\n\nShe turned her attention to her free hand, the left, which she\nhad kept ungloved since she and Jean-Pierre had made love the\nfirst time. Somehow it seemed only fitting that she stare at\nwhere her finger once was while making this call. On the second\nring a young woman's voice greeted her.\n\n \"This is Greta Locke,\" she said, and after a moment's\nhesitation, \"Matthew Locke's wife.\" She met Jean-Pierre's intense\nstare. \"I'd like to speak with Mitchell, please.\" A pause, then:\n\"Mitchell, hello. Yes, he's fine, thank you.\" Her expression\nturned serious as she smiled through the last of the lawyer's\ngreeting.\n\n\"Actually, Mitchell, things aren't exactly perfect,\" she said,\ntwisting the phone cord in her hand. Her eyes went to Jean-Pierre\nfor a moment, taking him in from head to toe, his boots. The\nranch, she reminded herself, boosting her courage. This was all\nfor their ranch. She took a deep breath and plunged on. \"I'm\ncalling you, Mitchell, because I want a divorce.\" Pinpoint dots\nof sweat had formed on her upper lip.\n\n\"I'm sorry?\" she said, shaking her gaze from Jean-Pierre. \"No,\nMatthew and I have not talked about it yet.\" Another pause. \"No,\nI don't know if it's what Matthew wants. It's what I want.\" She\nswallowed a deluge of conflicting emotions, her eyes pleading\nwith her lover for support.\n\nJean-Pierre dropped before her and rested his head in her lap.\n\n\"Yes, I will,\" she said, and placed her hand on Jean-Pierre's\nhead. \"Yes, as soon as he gets home from New York, yes.\"\n\nJean-Pierre lifted his face. He was silently mouthing a word, but\nshe could not understand him.\n\n\"No, I can't think of anything. I'm sure by the time I call you\nback I'll have - oh, wait.\" She cupped her hand over the\nmouthpiece.\n\n\"Property,\" Jean-Pierre whispered.\n\n\"Oh yes, Mitchell, I do have one question.\" She held the phone\nwith both hands and looked out the window. \"Mitchell, I'm not\nclear on a few things in these matters. The property. The house.\nAssets. Those sorts of things.\"\n\nJean-Pierre held her around the waist with both arms. In the\ndistance she could see his small cottage, the ranch, a few horses\nbeing led from the stable.\n\n\"It is half, then,\" she said softly. Her hand dropped to\nJean-Pierre's head and slid down to his shoulder. She held on\ntight. \"Half of everything,\" she uttered, feeling as if her lips\nwere suddenly anesthetized.\n\n\"Okay,\" she said, her voice different now, smaller. \"Thank you,\nMitchell. I'll contact you soon.\" She placed the handset on its\ncradle and closed her eyes.\n\nJean-Pierre seated himself beside her and wrapped his arms around\nher and held her tight. He whispered to her soothingly, to\nbreathe slowly, relax.\n\nShe opened her mouth, tried to form words, but they would not\ncome. After a minute she regained some control. \"My God,\nJean-Pierre,\" she managed, hiding her face in her trembling\nhands. \"That amounts to millions.\"\n\n\"Greta,\" he said, pulling her from him, \"You have earned your\nshare. You have worked for it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"Yes,\" an emphatic whisper. \"I have worked hard\nfor it, haven't I?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Jean-Pierre assured her, petting her hair. He smiled. \"You\nhave indeed.\"\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\"That's right, as much of it as I can sell,\" Peter said into the\ntelephone. With a disbelieving expression he shook his head at\nByron, who crossed his arms and shot him a mildly disturbed look.\n\n\"Okay, Peggy, thanks,\" Peter said, then hung up the phone.\n\n\"You sure you want to do that?\" Byron said carefully, turning his\ncoffee cup in his palm.\n\n\"You bet I am! Byron, I can't believe this! I can't believe\nMatthew has formed an alliance with them!\" Peter said, batting\nhis hand at the \"Wall Street Journal,\" whose headline announced,\n\"ICP, Wallaby Announce Strategic Venture.\"\n\n\"Petey, don't forget that 'them' is where this old timer comes\nfrom.\"\n\n\"I know, I know. I'm sorry. I don't mean to disparage you, or\nwhere you're from. I'm just astonished Matthew has actually done\nwhat he was trying to get me to agree to do. To sell out Wallaby\nto ICP.\"\n\n\"He's not selling out, boy. He's upping Wallaby's market.\nProbably triple it in a few years because of that two-step he\npulled today.\"\n\nPeter folded his arms. \"All the more reason for me to sell my\nshare in Wallaby and invest it in what we're working on. You\nknow, I'm in the mood for a little shopping spree. I think my\nmind is made up about those couple of acquisitions we've been\ntalking about. The net browser. The compression routines. And\ndefinitely that knock-out handwriting recognition kernel. Yes\nindeed, it's time to do a little spending.\"\n\nThe two men had turned the extra bedroom in Byron's Maine home\ninto a lab and workroom. Scattered all around were diagrams of\ncircuit boards, tools, and assorted computer and electronic\nparts. A flowchart of the software that Byron was engineering,\nbased on the design the two men had come up with in the last four\nmonths, was spread out on the table before them.\n\n\"Well, that's settled then,\" Byron said. \"Good. Now what do you\nsay you wipe that little snarl off your face and we get back to\nwork. Come on.\" He patted the stool beside him and Peter, still\nplainly agitated by the news, returned to his seat beside his\npartner.\n\n\"This is what I changed last night,\" Byron said, pointing at a\nseries of boxes indicating the user interface portion of the\ncode. \"It's what's going to make this baby different from every\nother portable doohickey out there.\"\n\nPeter leaned over the table, following Byron's finger. He shook\nhis head. \"No.\"\n\n\"No? No what?\"\n\nPeter roughly took Byron's hand in his. \"This!\" he said,\nencircling the entire drawing with the other man's finger and, in\ndoing so, pulling Byron from his stool and practically stretching\nhim across the table.\n\n\"Hey!\" Byron yelled. \"If you want to dance, just say so, but be\ncareful, boy, I prefer the floor to tables!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Peter said. He let go of Byron's hand, and gently\npatted it.\n\nByron tugged at his sweater sleeve and flexed his arm.\n\n\"But look at this,\" Peter said. \"All of this!\" he continued,\ngesturing in a frenzy now with both hands at the entire table,\nthe scattered parts, the room.\n\nByron casually fished his tobacco pouch from his shirt pocket.\n\n\"Don't you see what's wrong with all this stuff you're talking\nabout?\"\n\n\"Why don't you tell me,\" Byron said. He crossed his legs and\nbegan packing his pipe.\n\n\"First, with all respect to your history,\" Peter started, \"it's\ntoo complicated.\"\n\nByron took a few glowing tokes from his pipe than shook out the\nwooden match. His motions were slow, unruffled. He exhaled a\nplume of smoke, then strolled slowly around the table, eyeing the\ndiagram from over the rim of his glasses. \"Well, now that you\nmention it, she is kind of a little monster, ain't she?\"\n\n\"Little? Hah! If we were to code this thing as it is we'd need an\narmy of programmers. We need to break it down into smaller,\nsmarter chunks. Objects. Maybe we should snap up that little\nobject system those kids from Cal Poly showed us last week. Hell,\nlooking at this, two million doesn't sound like that much\nanymore.\"\n\n\"Mmm, that would definitely let us break her down to a more\nmanageable size. And adding features would be trivial. Okay,\nlet's call them back and have another look, make sure it'll do\nwhat we want,\" Byron said.\n\n\"There's something else.\"\n\n\"Such as?\" Byron said, squinting through the rising smoke trails.\n\n\"I'm not sure what it is, though. I mean, everything we've got\nworked out with the agent software is right on. All the\ncross-referencing between the applications, the net-savvy\nlook-ups and updates and all. But when I step back and look at\nthis, at how it's going to actually look and operate when it's\ndone, I feel like it's missing something. Under the hood we're\ndoing things no one has done before. But on the surface, as nice\nas it will look, it doesn't seem, well, new enough to me.\nDifferent enough. What can we do to make ours really different\nfrom the others that are cropping up out there. They've all got\nstyluses now. And there's that Sony slate computer that came out\nlast week with a track pad almost exactly like the Joey's, so\nthat's caught on too. All of it has. The add-on keyboards.\nCD-ROMs. Modems. PC Cards. The whole works. I don't know. Other\nthan the smart software agents we're putting in, what can we do\nto make ours the all-out winner. The really intelligent\nassistant.\"\n\n\"Mmm,\" Byron hummed.\n\n\"What we need is a new paradigm. A bigger-picture metaphor that\ngoes beyond what's already out there, taking this whole business\nto not just the next possible step, but two or three steps ahead.\nSomething that really get the juices flowing. I mean, this is all\nwell and good, but is it good enough?\" He knocked his fist gently\non the flowchart and stared intently at Byron.\n\n\"I'm with you.\"\n\nStaring intensely at the drawing, Peter let out an exasperated\nsigh. \"I just don't know what it should be. And that's the\nfrustrating part.\"\n\nGrace appeared at the doorway with a tray in her hands, holding\nsandwiches, French fries, two glasses of milk. \"Time for a break,\nboys.\"\n\n\"Ah, relief,\" Byron said, rubbing his hands together. \"Honey, we\ngot any vinegar for those fries?\"\n\n\"Coming right up,\" Grace said, handing the tray to her husband.\n\n\"Now, while we eat,\" Byron said, blowing on a hot French fry,\n\"you can give your head a rest for a few minutes, and I promise\nyou, while your stomach is doing some work of its own, your\nbrain'll be busy too.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure,\" Peter said. He took a sip of his milk.\n\nThe telephone rang.\n\n\"I'll get it,\" Grace said, returning from the kitchen with a\nbottle of cider vinegar. Byron made a beckoning gesture for the\nbottle.\n\n\"I got it,\" Peter said. \"Holmes residence,\" he said, wiping his\nlips on his sleeve. \"Hi, Peggy. What's up? Wait, let me guess, a\nproblem with my stock sale already,\" Peter said with a smirk and\na roll of his eyes at Byron.\n\n\"His secretary,\" Byron said, identifying the caller to his wife.\n\n\"What?\" Peter shouted, eyes suddenly wide with panic.\n\n\"What is it?\" Byron asked, coming to Peter's side.\n\n\"Hello?\" a voice called softly, from inside the house.\n\n\"All right, yes,\" Peter said. \"I'll get there as soon as I can.\"\nHe hung up the phone and stared at the handset.\n\n\"Hi,\" Kate said, bounding cheerfully into the room. \"I let myself\nin.\" She froze in place when she took in Peter's aghast\nexpression as he turned away and faced the wall. He locked his\nhands behind his neck and looked up at the ceiling.\n\n\"What the hell's wrong?\" Byron said.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Kate asked Grace, who replied with upturned\npalms. \"Peter?\" Kate gripped his arm. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Something back home,\" Peter said, avoiding every set of staring\neyes.\n\n\"Is it the stock sale, boy?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Then what?\" Kate asked, tugging his arm to make him face her.\n\nHe turned around and took her hands. \"Something happened. I have\nto go home.\" He studied their interlocked fingers. \"I can't tell\nyou about it right now.\" He looked her straight in the eye. It\nwas the wine, he thought grimly.\n\nHe let go of her hands. \"I need to get to the airport right\naway,\" he said to Byron.\n\n\"Okay,\" Kate said, \"let's go,\" taking his arm.\n\nPeter's feet remained planted.\n\n\"Peter?\"\n\n\"I have to go alone,\" he said, leaving no room for disagreement.\n\nGrace discreetly nudged her husband.\n\n\"Okay,\" Byron said, settling his hands on both Kate's and Peter's\nshoulders. \"Put your coat on. I'll take you to the airport.\" He\ngave Kate a reassuring look and a wink.\n\n\"Don't you want to pack some things?\" Kate said.\n\n\"There isn't time,\" Peter said. \"I'll call,\" he said, unable to\nlook her in the eye again, then turned and left the room.\n\n\"Be back in a bit,\" Byron said, kissing his wife on the cheek.\n\"Keep those fries in the oven please, dearest.\" He turned to Kate\nand gently squeezed her arm. \"It's going to be okay.\" Then he\nturned and went after Peter.\n\nHearing Byron's words of reassurance as he waited outside the\nworkroom, Peter felt the thing in his heart come fully awake. It\nhad been hibernating all through the winter and he had forgotten\nabout it. But now it was time to for it to reemerge.\n\nA knot of contradiction swelled in his throat when he remembered\nback to the premonition he'd had on that fateful night, more than\nhalf a year ago, that he was going to lose everything close to\nhis heart, everything that ever mattered. It was starting, he\nreasoned, and by the looks of it, Kate would be the first piece\nto fall away.\n\n\nChapter 14\n\n\nWilliam Harrell flipped through the folder of reports his\ntechnical adviser had left him, a pleased expression on his face.\n\nHis plan was approaching its final stages. Yesterday's strategic\nalliance announcement had been deemed an enormous success by the\npress, and in just a few short months the plan's final phase\nwould reach its climax.\n\nHe felt at ease and at peace now as he awaited the completion of\nhis original plan. Though he had a real scare when Byron Holmes\nhad called him four months earlier, asking for some of his notes\nand documentation, his former partner had ultimately assured him\nthat what he and Peter Jones were working on would not become a\n\"real\" product anytime soon.\n\nEven so, he still felt more than a little concern for what the\ntwo were up to, but after finishing his conversation with Byron,\nWilliam realized he had initially overreacted to his old friend's\nnew hobby, as Byron himself had referred to it.\n\nAnd now, with the strategic alliance phase complete, William felt\nfor the first time like he could lift his feet from the pedals\nand coast through the final stretch as he advanced to the finish\nline.\n\nWith regard to the merger, the FTC would never allow ICP to\nacquire Wallaby under the two companies' current modes of\noperation. To counter this regulation, ICP would halt production\nof its BP portable computer, thereby avoiding a monopoly by\npulling its own entry from the market-the Joey line would become\nICP's new standard. In doing so, an even greater battle would\ncease. The clone makers, companies that manufactured computers\nthat operated the same software as ICP's, would be nearly shut\ndown once ICP announced Joey as their new portable computing\nstandard. Unlike the BP, which used a third-party source\noperating system, the Joey was built upon Wallaby's proprietary\nhardware and software technologies, and was therefore illegal for\nother manufacturers to replicate it.\n\nWilliam's desktop now proudly displayed his prototype Joey II\nsystem, which he used for all of his office work. He'd had his\ntechnical adviser move his \"old\" BP to a shelf against the wall.\nAs far as he was concerned, he would no longer need it.\n\nThe irony of his plan was beginning to hit home. Here he sat, the\nchairman of the largest computer company in the world, with his\n\"competitor's\" product on his desk. William's dream was nearly\nreality. \"I liked the product so much, I bought the company,\" he\nquipped to himself as he activated the e-mail program.\n\nThe machine's modem dialed the phone and connected to the host\ncomputer. There was only one message, and as it was being written\nto his screen, scrolling quickly from the bottom of the screen to\nthe top, he saw that it was from Matthew Locke. The action was\ntoo quick for his eyes, so as he waited for the message to finish\ndownloading, he pulled a tissue from his drawer and cleaned the\ncomputer's monitor.\n\nMatthew's message was now unfolded on the display, complete, and\nas he wiped, the e-mail's subject caught his eye. He quickly\nscanned the screen for the gist of the message-and he froze.\n\nHis throat constricted and his mind slammed on the brakes,\nchucking him from his exhilarating joyride. He felt his insides\nrumble as if he were about to lose control of his system, not\nunlike the feeling, the lack of feeling, that he had experienced\nas Martha's hand let go of his when she had slipped away.\n\nHe forced his hands to be still on the desk and read the message\nfrom the beginning.\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nTO:  wharrell@icp.com\nFROM: mlocke@wallaby.com\nSUBJECT:  REVISED PLAN\n\nWilliam, I'll get right to the point: Yesterday's introduction of\nthe Joey II was phenomenal.\n\nTherefore, Wallaby and ICP will maintain a strategic alliance\nrelationship, as we disclosed to the press: Wallaby will work\nwith ICP to develop powerful Joey products which are compatible\nwith ICP systems.\n\nWe will not go through with our private original plan of merging\nthe two companies into one.\n\nI am satisfied with my role at Wallaby as chairman, president,\nand CEO, and I look forward to our two companies working\ntogether.\n\n--Matthew\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\n\n\"No,\" William declared breathlessly as he sank heavily into his\nchair. He raised the tissue to his brow, blotted the sweat that\nhad instantly formed there.\n\nIn one fell swoop, Matthew Locke had just changed William's\nentire plan-and the future of ICP. He felt his heart racing, and\nhe began to hyperventilate. He wondered if he was experiencing\nthe onset of a stroke. He held his palm over his heart and willed\nit to slow while he attempted to breathe evenly, all the while\nstaring at the message spilled across his-no, Matthew's!-screen.\n\nWhen he eventually calmed down enough to think a little more\nclearly, his panic was replaced by shallow emptiness. Then,\nvaguely at first, a strange feeling of grief and mourning numbed\nhis senses, resurfacing for the first time since he had begun his\nplan to acquire Wallaby.\n\nHis mind started racing, and his immediate reaction was to\nquickly counter Matthew's scheme by unveiling ICP's own\ncompetitive product, showing him that no one pushed the\nnumber-one computer maker around. Thinking this through, however,\nWilliam could hardly bring himself to ask the question, What can\nI do? He already knew the answer. Nothing. Hadn't he himself\nhalted any new designs of ICP's BP series, or for that matter,\nany new portable design, after reaching the \"Jones\" phase of the\noriginal plan, when Matthew had moved into power?\n\nNo backup plan, he thought and shook his head sadly. The\nfuneral...the rebound to Wallaby...through these events he had\nlost the foresight to build a backup plan in case something like\nthis should happen. And, he realized, taking the final blow,\nthere could be no going back. While he could simply pick up the\nphone and call his development heads in and put together a team\nto begin accelerated development of his technical and market\nadvisors' proposed concepts, a real product would not surface for\nat least twelve to eighteen months, probably more. He had no\nimmediate backup plan, no product of his own to augment ICP's new\nstrategic dependence and commitment to Wallaby and the Joey. He\ncould not cancel the strategic alliance.\n\nHis gaze lingered painfully over the Joey II stationed before\nhim. Its beautiful compact design, its crisp high-resolution\nscreen, its ergonomic keyboard, its slick trackpad. Gently,\nWilliam touched the trackpad, slid his fingertip across its\nsmooth black surface.\n\nSuddenly, strangely, his thoughts turned sympathetically to Peter\nJones. Matthew Locke had just pulled on William the same surprise\nhe had inflicted on Peter Jones.\n\nThen all at once he felt charged as if by a synaptic tingle, a\nstirring in his fingertip that shot up to his brain. At first he\nfeared he was completely losing control, but then he let out a\nlittle laugh, realizing, yes, he had crossed a fine line, and\nsuddenly it all made complete and wonderfully perfect sense to\nhim.\n\nThe call. Of course. It had been there all along, a hibernating\nbackup plan, but William had simply ignored it. There had been no\nreason to notice it. His old friend calling just to say hello, to\nask for a few notes, all along up to his old playful tricks.\n\nCould it be possible? Were they really onto something? Something\nthat William could perhaps enlist to save ICP from the switch\nMatthew Locke had just thrown?\n\nJones. That was the mistake he had allowed Matthew to make. A\nmistake that would now work in his favor.\n\nPerhaps you were right, Matthew, William mused, sliding his\nfingertip to an appended e-mail file. He opened it and searched\nfor Matthew's very first message to him after the board meeting\nin which Jones had been voted out of Wallaby. There it was.\nThough Matthew had tried to persuade Jones to stay on at Wallaby,\nhis exact words in the message were, \"We'll succeed regardless.\"\n\nYou may be right, Matthew, William thought silently. He slid his\nfingertip over to a tiny card-file icon on the screen, typed\n\"Holmes\" on the keyboard and tapped the find icon.\n\nHe tapped the phone icon and the Joey's modem dialed Byron\nHolmes's telephone number. As he waited for his old friend to\nanswer, he stared at his fingertip resting comfortably on the\ntrackpad. A sudden awareness hit him as if somehow he had just\nsolved a puzzle that had been silently challenging him for a long\ntime, that Wallaby without Peter Jones was as unsound as a the\nJoey without its sleek intuitive trackpad.\n\nGrace answered, and they exchanged a few moments of courteous\nconversation then William asked for Byron.\n\n\"He's in his play room. I'll tell him to pick up.\"\n\nA moment later, Byron came on the line. \"Hi, Billy.\"\n\n\"Byron, how are things coming along?\" William asked.\n\n\"Oh, not bad. You know, too cold to fish, mostly sitting around\nthe house, stoking a fire.\"\n\n\"Right,\" William said, knowing he couldn't just pop Byron's cap\nopen without a little playing. \"And in your spare time, how's\nyour hobby coming along?\"\n\n\"Well, now, Billy, is there something you're curious about?\"\n\n\"Yes, there is.\" He decided to come right to the point with his\nold friend, to simply ask for his help. \"I'm very interested in\nwhat you and Peter Jones are working on.\"\n\n\"It's good stuff, Billy, though we've had a little bit of a\npause.\"\n\n\"What kind of pause?\"\n\n\"Petey had to go back to California. Had some business to deal\nwith.\"\n\nCalifornia: Wallaby. Was there more to Matthew Locke's scheming?\nHad he persuaded Jones to come back to Wallaby, to rejoin him in\nleading the company? That would explain Matthew's newfound\nresolution to go it alone, without ICP. After all, wasn't Jones\nthe one who had been so resistant to ICP all these years?\n\n\"Back to Wallaby?\"\n\n\"Hell, no. Quite the contrary. Petey started selling off his\nWallaby stock yesterday to fund our project.\"\n\nWilliam knew that Jones's stock sale would yield millions of\ndollars, many digits, the sort of lengthy figures required for\nserious development. Things were coming along, then. Which meant\nthat they were probably well on their way to a real product\ndesign after all.\n\n\"He's selling the stock because he was disgusted that you and\nWallaby are in a deal together,\" Byron said. \"He predicts that\nyou're going to buy them in less than a year, and he doesn't want\nany of his money going to that. Nothing personal, Billy. It's\nLocke he's angry with.\"\n\nTouche, William thought, ironically pleased that Jones's\nspeculation was right on target. He dabbed his forehead with a\nfresh tissue. \"Byron, I'd like to make a proposition.\"\n\n\"Shoot.\"\n\n\"I'd like to have a look at what you are working on. When you are\nready, of course.\"\n\n\"Hmm. I like that idea, Billy, but I don't know if Petey would\nfeel the same way.\"\n\n\"Byron, listen to me,\" William plunged on, pulling out all stops.\n\"The Wallaby announcement is meant as a temporary solution. We\nwant to come out with our own system that will do everything the\nJoey can, but more.\"\n\n\"Billy, you don't sound so good. Are you all right?\"\n\n\"No, Byron. I'm not. I'm asking you for a favor, from one old\nfriend to another. Let me have a look at what you're working on.\"\n\n\"Well, since you put it that way, let me see what I can do. I\nthink I can get Petey to agree to let you have a peek.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"That I don't know. A little while. He needs some time to himself\nto take care of some personal business.\"\n\n\"Fair enough,\" William said, and said good-bye.\n\nHe glanced out the window at the World Trade Center. This may be\nthe best way, he reasoned. After all, the portable system\nstationed before him had been invented by Jones. And even if his\nplan to acquire Wallaby had worked, wouldn't he have been plagued\nwith worry over Jones's next step?\n\nPerhaps this time, he pondered as he gazed out the window, he\nwould get the strategic ally he had been after all along. Peter\nJones.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nPeter stared absently at the clock mounted high on the yellow\ncinderblock wall. Following the second hand's ride around the\ndial, he mused at how as a boy he used to watch the clock in\nschool, the thin red line sliding silently past the bold black\nnumerals, inching painfully closer with each agonizing second\ntoward the end of the school day. Would this baby ever have the\nopportunity to watch the second hand sweep the dial in a\nschoolroom?\n\nHe had been sitting at Stanford Hospital for hours. His neck and\nback were sore from sleeping on the hard plastic furniture, and\nnow, staring at the clock once more, he willed the thin red line\nto go slower, for each precious second offered more hope, life,\nfor this unborn baby.\n\nHis baby.\n\nAt first Peter had not wanted to believe the doctor, insisting\nthat there had been a mistake, a mix-up, that he was just a\nfriend of Ivy's, and it couldn't possibly be his baby. But the\ndoctor relayed to Peter, from Ivy, that she had been with no one\nelse in more than a year before Peter, and no one after. The\ndoctor offered to conduct a simple blood test that would settle\nthe matter, but Peter decided against it.\n\nHe knew Ivy was telling the truth. It was his baby, and he prayed\nthat it not be delivered. Not just yet. It needed more time.\n\nDr. Chen, the resident physician caring for Ivy, said the chances\nof survival for the twenty-eight-week infant were roughly ninety\nto ninety-five percent.\n\nPeter could not believe this was happening to him. It was not\nsomething he asked for or wanted. Not like this, anyway. He had\nassumed (hadn't he?) that she had used some sort of protection.\nIn the past, he and Kate had never worried about birth-control.\nWith Kate it was neither an issue or a possibility.\n\nHe thought back to their night together, her desperation. He also\nrecalled the indications of her drug usage. The doctor warned him\nthat she was very weak, and had admitted to taking drugs during\nthe pregnancy. The birth would be difficult and extremely\ndangerous for her, considering her overall poor health. Presently\nthe physician was attempting to prevent the premature birth by\nadministering medication that could retard labor, to allow the\nbaby its final eight weeks of development in the womb.\n\nNow, waiting to find out if the drugs would take effect, Peter\nsat alone, wondering what he would do if the baby was born today,\nor next week...or whenever, for that matter. Even if they\nsuccessfully postponed the birth, there was no running away from\nthe fact that it was his child. And what about Ivy? Would she ask\nhim to marry her? Who was the faulty party? Hadn't he known that\nhe had done the wrong thing? Hadn't he known afterwards that\nthings would never be the same again with Kate?\n\nKate. Their talk, before they had gone to dinner at the Holmeses'\nfor the first time, about wanting a baby. About wanting to settle\ndown, to marry. What would happen to him and Kate?\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Jones,\" Dr. Chen said, snapping Peter's gaze\nfrom the clock.\n\n\"How is she?\"\n\n\"There's been a change. After her first round of medication the\ncontractions were less frequent, indicating that the pregnancy\nwould not proceed,\" the doctor explained.\n\n\"That's good news, right?\"\n\n\"It was good. But Ivy has passed fluid. The amniotic sac is\nleaking. Her labor has resumed. We have no choice but to see it\nthrough.\"\n\n\"But the baby?\"\n\n\"We don't know how much damage Ivy's drug abuse may have caused\nthe baby, or herself. Any baby coming into the world early runs\nthe risk of respiratory distress syndrome.\"\n\nPeter shook his head impatiently to indicate that he didn't\nunderstand, and Dr. Chen explained.\n\n\"A vital substance that coats the lining of the baby's lungs and\nits small interior cavities, called alveoli, is not fully\nadvanced at this stage of development. The air sacs in the lungs\ntend to stay collapsed. We'll have the baby on a respirator, of\ncourse, but there may be other complications.\"\n\nPeter closed his eyes, images of tiny pink, deflated balloons\nstreaking across his mind. So fragile. So vulnerable and\nhelpless.\n\nThe doctor placed a hand on Peter's shoulder. \"This isn't going\nto be easy,\" he said. \"We'll do our best.\"\n\nAnd then the doctor was gone, leaving Peter to stare once more at\nthe clock and wait, all by himself.\n\n\nChapter 15\n\n\n\"Hello, Matthew,\" Greta said coolly, settling her coffee cup onto\nits saucer.\n\n\"Hi,\" Matthew said brightly. He dropped his garment bag and\nbriefcase in the doorway, strolled past her without so much as a\nglance, and went to the kitchen, where he poured himself a glass\nof orange juice, drank it in one gulp, and set the glass on the\ncountertop.\n\n\"Has Marie been sick or something?\" he said, striking up\nconversation as he strolled into the breakfast area, peeling the\npaper wrapper off a muffin.\n\n\"I gave her a few days off,\" Greta said. \"She'll be back this\nafternoon.\"\n\n\"How come the time off?\" Matthew said, without much interest. He\nate his muffin and pulled apart the newspaper, folded it on the\ntable, scanned the page, then glanced across it to his wife.\n\n\"I didn't want her around. I wanted to be alone.\"\n\nHe nodded, as if respecting her wish for privacy, then started\nreading yet another article reporting yesterday's Wallaby and ICP\nNew York City announcement.\n\n\"Matthew,\" Greta said abruptly.\n\n\"Hmm?\" he replied, his eyes never leaving the article.\n\n\"We need to talk.\"\n\nHe looked up distractedly for a moment at his wife, then returned\nhis attention to the newspaper. \"Okay. Do we have yesterday's\n'Examiner'?\" He looked around the room. \"I couldn't find one in\nNew York.\"\n\n\"Over there. Next to the sofa,\" she said, indicating the pile of\npapers in the sitting room. He went to the stack and picked up\nthe topmost issue and sat down on the sofa. \"What were you\nsaying?\"\n\nShe studied him, instantly oblivious to her again as he read\nabout himself and yesterday's news. In an odd way she was glad\nthat he was behaving like this, poring over himself in the\nnewspaper, for it solidified her determination and kicked up the\nheat of her anger a few more notches. There he sat, holding in\nhis hands the cause for their breakup, smiling proudly at his own\npicture of himself and his damned machine. Should she feel any\nguilt or remorse for having taken a lover, for calling the lawyer\nyesterday to inform him that she wanted to divorce Matthew, when\nthere he sat beaming at his engagement announcement to a stupid\nlittle computer?\n\nWell then, let's see how he liked her newsbreak announcement. She\nstood up from the table walked over to where he sat, crossed her\narms and waited for him to acknowledge her.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said, folding the newspaper and tossing it to the\nfloor, \"I just wanted to see what they said locally.\" Rubbing his\nhands together, he settled back comfortably into the sofa. \"Now,\nwhat was it you were saying?\"\n\nIt was plain to see that he was being perfunctory, that he\ncouldn't wait to be done with whatever it was she wanted to talk\nabout so he could rush off to the office, where, having just\nflown in from New York, he'd squeeze in a few more hours of work.\nShe pictured him on the plane, skipping the meal so he wouldn't\nhave to sacrifice the workspace of his tray table. It was just\nthe sort of image she needed to complete her anger and loathing.\n\nShe said, \"I want a divorce.\" The words rolled off her tongue\neasily and she nearly smiled to herself. So simple. She tucked\nher fist in her robe pockets as he stood, hands open at his\nsides.\n\n\"Honey? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Shall I get you a dictionary?\"\n\n\"Greta,\" he said cautiously, clasping his hands together. \"I know\nI've been busy, but it's all been for this.\" He tapped the pile\nof newspapers with his foot.\n\n\"My oh my, the papers are right, you are smart. Yes, it has all\nbeen for that,\" she agreed, stamping her foot over the picture of\nhis face.\n\n\"But honey,\" he said, wrongfully interpreting her sarcasm, \"I've\nchanged my mind. I sent a message to William before leaving New\nYork calling the whole thing off! I don't want Wallaby and ICP to\nmerge as we had originally planned. This way I - I mean, Wallaby\n- will have more power because now we're going to grow at a\nphenomenal rate, all because of yesterday's announcement.\" His\neyes were shining. \"The plan is off!\" he said, and gripped her\nshoulders.\n\n\"And so are we!\" she spat, shrugging from his touch.\n\n\"But Greta, wait. I mean, I know we've had our problems, but that\ndoesn't mean we should just throw away our lives together.\"\n\n\"Together?\" she said, astonished. \"What lives, Matthew? What\ntogether?\" She shook her head sadly at his photograph smiling up\nat her from the newspaper. \"There's your together.\"\n\n\"Greta? What is it? What have I done? What can I do? Is there\nsomething you want?\"\n\n\"No, Matthew, not from you.\" She touched her finger to her\nhorseshoe charm, slid it from side to side. \"This time, I've\ngotten what I want all by myself.\"\n\nThis seemed funny to him. \"Oh?\" he said grandly. \"And what's\nthat, honey?\"\n\n\"Love.\"\n\nThat wasn't what he'd had in mind. He blinked several times\nrapidly. His eyes locked on a point in the ceiling. All the\nclowning was gone from his face. He had expected something\namusing, like a new hobby or craft, but this took him by complete\nsurprise. \"An affair?\" he asked, catching her eye. She looked\naway. He tugged the cuffs of his shirtsleeves, composed himself,\nall business. \"An affair,\" he repeated. \"I see.\"\n\n\"It's your fault.\"\n\nHe was thoughtful for a moment, then cleared his throat. \"Yes. I\nsuppose it is.\"\n\nMatthew's first reaction was to tell her about Laurence. He cared\nvery much for the girl, and telling his wife so would at least\ngive him the satisfaction of equally offending the fidelity they\nhad promised one another when they married. He wanted to tell his\nwife how Lauri had helped him build his confidence the way she\nonce had, and too how the girl brought him pleasure in ways she,\nhis wife, never had. But what would that accomplish? She was\nhaving an affair, he thought absently as he perused the room,\neyes stopping here and there. He might be having an affair with\nLaurence, but he was not in love with her, and he certainly had\nno desire to marry her. He was not in love with his own wife\neither, but, he quickly calculated in his mind, he could not bear\na divorce. It was a matter of economics. Quite simply, if he\nagreed, she would be entitled to at least half of his assets,\nover fifteen million dollars, give or take a million. His\nalternative: appease her, make her feel better, no matter what\nthe investment. A weekend cottage in Monterey? A trip around the\nworld? Whatever she wanted, he would give it to her - he would\nthink of it as an insurance policy.\n\n\"Darling, I'm so sorry,\" he said with pleading eyes. \"It really\nis my fault. What with my obsession over Wallaby all this time,\nletting things get this far away from me. From us. However, I\ndon't think divorce is the right answer. We should try to work\nthis out.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"Do you think I don't know what you're thinking? Oh\nyes, half of this is mine. And that's the law. Darling.\"\n\nHe swallowed. She knew him too well, could read him so easily. He\ncouldn't hide from her his fear of losing half of his wealth. He\nhad to try a different angle.\n\n\"But you're the one having an affair. You admitted it. How do you\nthink that will hold up?\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter. California still splits the pot.\"\n\n\"This is bullshit.\"\n\n\"You should know, you're so full of it.\"\n\n\"Don't challenge me on this, Greta.\"\n\n\"Too late. I called Mitchell yesterday, and told him - \"\n\nMatthew cut her short. \"You what?\" His voice was a disbelieving\nrasp. \"You called my friend and told him we wanted a divorce?\"\n\n\"No. I said I wanted it. But yes,\" she said with a shrug,\nunafraid, \"that's what I did.\"\n\n\"How dare you contact my lawyer when I knew nothing of this! Are\nyou crazy?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, darling. That's exactly what I am, crazy. Driven mad\nby Mr. Chips. At least that's what I'm ready to tell the court,\nif I decide I'd like more than half. In fact, I think I need to\nlie down, I'm feeling sort of suicidal again. All the stress I've\nbeen under since this happened.\" She stuck her four-fingered hand\nout at him.\n\nHe smacked it away. \"I'll fight you on this, Greta.\"\n\n\"Try. You'll only make matters worse for yourself,\" she said,\nkicking the newspapers. \"It doesn't matter what they might say\nabout me in the papers. But you, my dear - you better think twice\nbefore you make your next move, or it's going to cost you a hell\nof a lot more than you can afford.\"\n\nIt was true. The press would turn this kind of thing into a\ncircus. He had seen this expression on her face before, this same\nexpression he had once found so alluring, so sure and empowering,\nso certain of his success, their success. When working on his\nbehalf, this look had once charged him with excitement,\nconfidence. Now he saw the face of his opponent from across the\nring, and she looked fanatical in the way she said she was - in\nthe way she would convince the court she was, and possibly all\nbut wipe him out.\n\nHe needed time. This was too much to handle right now, especially\nin light of his change of heart with ICP. He had to make a deal\nwith her, come to some sort of understanding, at least for a\nshort while until he could deal with this properly.\n\n\"What about a trial period?\" he said. \"Just give me a little\ntime, and we'll work out some sort of settlement between us. In\nthe meantime, I'll leave you alone. You can have whatever you\nneed to go away on your own if you'd like. Let's just not do\nanything hasty. Please, Greta. I'm asking nicely. Just give me\nsome breathing room to sort through this.\"\n\nShe thought for a moment about what Jean-Pierre had told her.\nFirst, he was going to travel to France to look at properties for\nthem. That would take some time. And once he found something, she\nwould have to pack, and with all the logistics involved in\nmoving, especially to another country, that too would take\nawhile. Either way, she would be in California for at least a few\nmore months while she and Jean-Pierre made their plans. There was\nno real hurry, and, she suddenly realized, they had not even\ndiscussed marriage. Would they marry? She felt an unexpected\nchill along her neck. Perhaps it was best to play it cool, she\ntold herself, while the arrangements for France were being made.\n\nShe said, \"I may choose to travel, get away for while. Maybe even\nstay somewhere else.\"\n\nWhat could that cost? Matthew asked himself. Compared to what she\nmight get if they were to proceed with a divorce, setting her up\nin her own place amounted to a pinch of salt. For now.\n\n\"Fine. Whatever you need. Let's see what happens when things\nsettle down in a few months.\"\n\n\"Ha ha, that's what you think. Please, take a good look at\nyourself. With you it will never settle down, Matthew. You're\nmarried to Wallaby, not me. You think you've replaced Peter Jones\nas some sort of hotshot smart aleck, but now you're as sickly\nattached to that company as he ever was. You didn't want him out\nof your way so you could run the business - no, you were after\nmore. You were after his lover. And you got it.\" She shot him a\nmean laugh and turned her head in disgust. And began to cry.\n\nIf only right now he would come to her and hold her, and tell her\neverything would be all right, and kiss her, really kiss her, the\nway he once had, full of need and desire, then she would go back\nto him, make their marriage work again. Somehow. As happy as\nJean-Pierre made her feel, she understood that she had only begun\nher affair with him because Matthew had rejected her. If he\nwanted her back, he could have her. But it was now or never.\n\nMatthew turned away. \"Fine,\" he said flatly, then lifted his\nbriefcase and walked out of the house, got in his car, and drove\naway.\n\nAnd along with him went all of her hopes of ever realizing the\nplan for happiness they had made before moving to California. It\nwas really over. She was now in control of her own plan. She was\nscared, but she was determined. To hell with him. With her share\nof the money, she could live the rest of her life without a care.\nShe hugged herself tightly inside the sleeves of her robe, and an\neerie thought entered her mind. She shivered, and the hairs on\nher arms stood up. Glancing around the room, at their things, she\nunderstood for the very first time that everything she ever\nassociated with Matthew - money, power, luxury - all of a sudden\ndidn't matter anymore. She was angry with herself for thinking\nshe should go back to him. Was she going mad? Had he really made\nher crazy? How could she in one instant wish to go back to him,\nand in the next wonder if he had ever really mattered? Had he\nbeen an instrument to her, just as she had been to him? It sure\nlooked that way now. She had used him to acquire more and more\nthings, but she no longer needed these tokens of power and\nprestige. There was only one thing she needed now, the love of\nher attractive Frenchman. Nothing else mattered anymore.\n\nFeeling free for the first time of the man to whom she had felt\nso dependent, Greta calmly sat down on the sofa. Yes, it would be\nworth waiting a little longer while Jean-Pierre created their new\nworld.\n\nAfter all, she told herself, she had nothing to lose.\n\n\nChapter 16\n\n\n\"Mr. Jones,\" Dr. Chen said, lightly shaking Peter's shoulder.\n\nPeter snapped awake. \"What time is it?\" he asked as he shakily\nrose to his feet. Dr. Chen gently steadied him. Daylight shone\nthrough the windows at the end of the hall. He glanced at the\nwall clock. Half past noon. He had been asleep for little more\nthan an hour.\n\n\"It's time for you to see Ivy,\" Dr. Chen said. He led Peter by\nthe arm through swinging double doors. \"And your baby girl.\"\n\nPeter stopped in his tracks. He felt flushed and his throat felt\nswollen. \"She's all right? And the baby too? They both made it\nthough okay?\"\n\nDr. Chen carefully guided Peter to the wall, out of the way of\nthe busy corridor traffic. \"Not entirely,\" he said. \"There were\ncomplications. Both Ivy and the baby are very fragile. The baby\nweighs only two and three-quarter pounds. She's in neonatal care\nright now, hooked up to life-support equipment.\"\n\n\"But she's alive.\"\n\n\"Yes. She's alive,\" the doctor said. \"The outlook is fair, but we\ndon't know yet if there is other damage. Damage we can't see from\nthe drugs.\"\n\nPeter felt a sudden wave of revulsion. Images of strangely\ntwisted limbs and gnarled faces flashed in his mind. He himself\nand asked,  \"Is she retarded?\"\n\n\"There is no disfiguration,\" the doctor said. \"But it's too early\nto judge her overall condition. She appears to be a normal, if\npremature baby.\"\n\nPeter allowed himself a tight smile. \"Thank you, doctor,\" he\nsaid.\n\nThey ambled down the hall. \"Ivy's not doing well,\" the doctor\nadded, \"but she insisted on seeing you now. She's very weak, so\nyou'll only have a few minutes.\"\n\nPeter nodded. \"Then can I see...?\" he said and left the question\nunfinished, wondering what was the baby's name.\n\n\"Yes. But that must be brief too,\" the doctor said, bringing him\nup to a closed door. \"Wait, Mr. Jones,\" Dr. Chen said, gripping\nPeter's wrist as he reached for the door latch. \"Her condition is\nnot very good, physically or mentally. Don't upset her. Try to\nencourage her. I don't know what your plans are with her, but try\nto reinforce her with some positive thoughts. Do you understand?\"\n\nPeter nodded, then gingerly opened the door and went into the\nroom. The shades were drawn, and strange electronic sounds\nemanated from machines stationed beside the bed. He went to her.\n\nA dim lamp spread yellow light over the bed, and through the\nblankets covering her Peter could see that Ivy was very thin. Her\nhead was tilted toward the window and her closed eyelids seemed\ndark and bluish. She looked so different from when he had thrown\nher out of his home. He remembered her pure adoration, her desire\nto please him with her project. He braced himself against the bed\nrail and leaned his face closer to hers. She smelled medicinal,\nsterile. Her delicate bone structure, her pert nose, were masked\nby thin, nearly transparent skin. He felt responsible. Guilty. He\nmust take care of her.\n\nAnd Kate...? No. He couldn't let himself think about that right\nnow. He had to let Ivy know everything would be all right, that\nhe would take care of her.\n\nHe whispered her name and she stirred, eyelids fluttering. A thin\nsmile touched her lips, then she blinked a few times and her eyes\nfilled with tears. She let out a long breath through pressed\nlips, closed her eyes, and made an anguished face. \"I told myself\nI wouldn't get like this when I saw you.\" She looked away.\n\n\"Hey,\" he said, touching her cheek. She pulled her hand from\nbeneath the blankets and wrapped her thin fingers around his. His\nbody stiffened at her chilly, tenuous touch. At once he felt pity\nand fear. He was afraid for her life. She looked as if she were a\nbreath away from dying. She had all but destroyed herself. And\nthe baby? What had she done to the baby? He wanted to hold her,\ntell her she was forgiven, yet he was the one who should be\nasking for forgiveness. It was all so twisted.\n\n\"Don't,\" she said, pulling her hand away. \"Just don't. I don't\nknow what I'm more disgusted about. Me, or you? I wanted you, and\nyou took me and then you threw me away.\" Her words were thick and\nslurred. She was bombed on painkillers and tranquilizers and\nwhatever else they were feeding her through the intravenous tube.\n\"I threw myself away, too, after you made me go. I think I wanted\nto make the baby go away. I think I did what I did, the drugs and\nall, to hurt it. I'm sick Peter. I'm very sick now, and I have to\nget all this poison out of me. Including you.\"\n\n\"Ivy, don't talk this way. I'm sorry. You're sorry. We're both\nsorry for the mistake we made. But we've got to deal with it.\nIt's my responsibility.\"\n\nShe winced. \"Now you come to my rescue,\" a pause, then, \"I'm\nsorry. I don't want to be like this. I just hate you right now.\nSo much. Christ, that ride from LA up here.\"\n\nShe was making no sense at all. \"What are you talking about?\"\nMaybe, he thought, it would be better to leave and come back\nlater, after she had rested.\n\n\"Yes. The ride. To see Kate McGreggor. She was the one I wanted\nto meet, more than you. She was who I wanted to be like. Her\nguards, or whatever they are, never let me in to see her. I tried\nto find out more about her, where she lived and all. That was\nwhen I found that article about you, with her in it. I didn't\neven know who you were. And then I read about what you'd done,\nand that you were why the Joey was what it was, I don't know, I\nwanted to do that instead. I hated her then. I didn't want to be\na musician anymore. I wanted to be a techno-artist or something.\nIt's my parent's fuckin' fault, my liberal upbringing. I don't\nknow. Or maybe something else. They're here now. Better late than\nnever, right? Hey, lucky me, I can call them by their first\nnames, but I could never call them Mom and Dad. That's what I\nwanted. Rick and Jeannette. No. It's not their fault. What am I\nsaying? I don't even know who I am.\"\n\nShe turned her head away from him and rested. She lay still for a\nwhile, and when he thought she was asleep he turned to go.\n\n\"Stop,\" she said in a rasp. \"We're not done.\" She was sitting up.\nHer eyes were dry now, awake yet unalive. \"We're gonna make a\ndeal. You've got a baby to take care of now, Peter. I can't do\nit. Not right now, at least. I can't even piss on my own. I have\nto push a button to get one of them to help me. How the hell'm I\ngonna take care of a baby? I can't even name the thing. That's\nyour call, too. You get to call all the shots, Peter. Shoot,\nbang, bang, I'm almost dead. You're holding the gun, man. Don't\ngo shootin' your own head, though. Oh, don't worry, I'll get\nbetter - it's the only way I'll get you. Get back at you is what\nI mean. You got a cigarette?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\nShe made a disgusted face at him and waved her hand, scratching\nher fingers through her hair. \"Then there's the other thing. I\ncan't do any more about it. Not for a while. You might as well\ntake a look at it.\"\n\n\"What other thing?\"\n\nLike a drunkard at a bar, signaling for a particular brand, she\ngestured to the corner of the room. \"In there. In my pack. Get\nit.\"\n\nHe opened a narrow cabinet door and pulled her blue knapsack from\nthe shelf. He held it to her. She smacked it with her hand. \"Open\nit yourself.\"\n\nInside he found several notebooks and pens.\n\n\"The disks, dick.\"\n\nAnd he found a large stack of diskettes, bound together by rubber\nbands.\n\n\"What is it?\" he said.\n\nOnce more she turned her head on the pillow so that she was\nfacing away from him. \"What's it say on the label?\"\n\n\"ISLE.\"\n\n\"You can read.\"\n\n\"Ivy,\" he started, but then held his tongue. She had every right\nto be treating him this way. But she was saying things he didn't\nwant to hear her say. She was heavily drugged and needed rest.\nThey could deal with all this in a few days. \"Why don't we do all\nthis later?\"\n\n\"There is no 'later.' I don't want to see you again. Not for a\nlong time, till I'm able to look at you without all this shit in\nme and coming out of me.\"\n\n\"Then what? What is this? What do you want me to do with it?\"\n\n\"That ride I told you about, from LA back up here with the idea\nof somehow meeting you? I heard 'Teach the Children' on the radio\non the way up. It hit me like a cyclone. I had to stop in Fresno\nto find the tape. I played it over and over. I thought, yeah,\nteach them well, and do it with computers. I mean, it's what I\nknew I had to do, with what I was thinking about language, the\nidea of it applied to Joeys and letting kids learn with them. And\nsomehow my hormones and whatever else was in me when I met you\nthought, 'Do it with your own kid, like with him, you, make a\nbaby out of it all and the program will write itself.' I waited\nuntil it was the right time of the month to make you that dinner\nI made, so we'd do it, and get it all going the way I saw it.\"\n\n\"You did this on purpose? This baby?\"\n\n\"Yes. But stop it. I mean, we're talking about the other now.\nWe're on that, what's in your hands.\"\n\n\"What's it got to do with what you said?\"\n\n\"It means Intelligent Speech and Language Environment. There's a\nlittle box in there too, synthesizer and recognizer all in one.\nBut it's not just for kids, or learning. It's whatever you want\nit to be. You'll see what I mean. Go ahead, take it, the notes\nand code lists and everything, it's all in there. See if it's\nworth anything to you. Hell knows, I'm gonna have a shit load of\nbills when I'm through with this rinse cycle.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"'Okay' is all you say. No thanks? Jesus. That's just like you.\"\n\n\"Thanks. I mean, we'll figure this all out. We will.\"\n\n\"Blah, blah, blah.\"\n\nThe door opened behind him. He turned. The nurse and a\nmiddle-aged couple entered the room. \"Mr. Jones, Ivy's parents\nwould like to be with her now.\"\n\nHe looked at Ivy. He could not see her face.\n\n\"Get better,\" he said to her and she responded with a huffing\nsound.\n\nThe man came before Peter. His face was tanned and pleasant, and\nthe woman at his side was attractive. Her hair was bright, like\nIvy's. She looked at Peter sadly, and pressed her husband forward\nan inch.\n\nHe spoke. \"Mr. Jones, we'd like to know how you intend to take\ncare of this.\"\n\n\"Dad,\" Ivy said to the window, \"lay off. We're dealing with it.\"\n\n\"We had hoped you wouldn't come,\" Mrs. Green said. \"We would be\nthe child's guardians if you hadn't. We'll gladly take care of\nher.\"\n\n\"Get out,\" Ivy said, poking Peter in the ribs. \"Just get out with\nit all.\"\n\n\"This child's an enormous responsibility,\" the father said.\n\"Please let us take her.\"\n\n\"Right, Dad. Like you know all about it. Got a joint on you?\"\n\n\"I can take care of her,\" Peter said, clutching the knapsack with\nboth hands. \"And I will provide for Ivy.\"\n\n\"You sure will,\" Ivy piped in. \"I'll send you the tab.\" She\nsnorted and laughed, then she started crying. Her father glanced\nher way, then looked at Peter. He shook his head in\ndisappointment and went to his daughter's side.\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" Peter said to Mrs. Green.\n\n\"To say the least,\" she said, joining her husband and daughter.\n\nPeter exited the room carrying the knapsack. From the hallway he\ntook one last look at Ivy and her parents before the door closed,\nshutting out the image huddled behind it. He was dazed by the\nevents of the last forty-eight hours. He slowly made his way down\nthe corridor, turning once to look back at the closed door to her\nroom. The first thought to surface through his haze of emotions\nwas of the baby. He had promised these people that he would care\nfor her.\n\nHe paused before the nurses' station and asked how to reach the\nneonatal care unit. He tramped down the corridor, rounded the\ncorner, and pushed through a set of swinging double doors. To the\nnurse sitting at a small desk, he said, \"Pardon me, which baby is\nthe Jones-Green baby? I'm her father.\"\n\nThe nurse led him into a clean room and instructed him to put on\na sterile gown and a face mask. He followed her orders in\nsilence. Dressed in the sanitary outfit, he followed the nurse\ninto a room containing a row of clear plastic bubble-like\nincubators, one of which held his baby's fragile baby. It was a\nstrange setting, surreal, like something out of a science fiction\nfilm.\n\n\"Here she is,\" the nurse said.\n\nEncased in the hygienic shell lay his baby girl. She was tiny,\nand he could see thin, pulsing veins through her skin and bruises\nall over her body. Her head! It looked so huge and unnatural, he\nthought with alarm. He leaned closer, panicked.\n\nThe nurse saw his aghast expression and touched a gloved hand to\nhis arm. \"Oh, don't worry. That's normal,\" she said. \"All the\nrest of her will catch up in the next couple of weeks. The head\ndevelops a little faster at this stage. It's perfectly ordinary.\"\n\n\"What is all this?\" he asked, studying the clear tubes entering\nher nostrils and poking into her arms and belly, the wires and\nprobes taped to her impossible little body.\n\n\"Respiratory, protein, waste, heart,\" the nurse said, indicating\nthe various points, all of which appeared crudely connected and\nheld in place by swatches of white tape.\n\n\"How is she?\"\n\n\"We're keeping a close eye on her. It was a difficult birth, but\nshe seems like a fighter.\"\n\n\"Hang in there, little girl,\" Peter whispered.\n\n\"I'm afraid we have to leave now. We need to be extremely careful\nabout exposure.\"\n\nPeter and nodded, and through his paper face mask he kissed his\ngloved fingers and touched the plastic shell. He straightened and\nfollowed the nurse out of the room. Pulling himself free of the\ngreen scrub outfit, he glanced one last time back through the\nglass window into the neonatal room. He collected the knapsack\nand pushed through the doors.\n\nSitting outside the room in one of the hard plastic waiting\nchairs, was Kate.\n\nWithout a word she stood and caught him in her arms. She held him\nfor a moment, stiffly, then guided him to the seat beside her.\n\n\"Jesus, Kate. How did you - ?\"\n\n\"I called Peggy. She told me you were here.\"\n\nPeter looked at the silver doors. \"She's so tiny. \"\n\n\"I heard,\" Kate said. She pressed her folded hands into her lap\nand cleared her throat. \"Peter, why? Why didn't you tell me?\"\n\nHe closed his eyes. He felt precariously close to throwing up,\nsurrounded by riddles and agony. Ivy. The baby. Kate.\n\n\"Kate,\" he said, \"I didn't think this would happen.\" He opened\nhis eyes and looked at her. \"You have to believe me.\"\n\n\"How many does this make?\" Kate said, bitterly. \"We could have\nadopted.\"\n\nHe tried to put his arm around her, but she pulled away and\nstood, hugging her arms tightly around herself.\n\n\"Kate, none,\" he said, moving closer. \"There have never been any\nothers. I didn't plan this to happen.\"\n\n\"And she did?\"\n\n\"No. Yes! I don't know,\" he said. \"She was desperate. It just\nhappened. I didn't want it to, but it just did. We'd had too much\nto drink. It was the wine - \"\n\nShe slapped him hard across the face.\n\nWithout a word, he dropped his chin to his chest. He knew that\nthe blow he had struck her, this whole situation, had cut deep.\nThe damage would take a very long time to heal. But he had to\nhave her forgiveness, because without her he would never get\nthrough this.\n\n\"Kate, please. I don't know what we'll do,\" he said. \"But please\ndon't leave me. I need you.\"\n\nDr. Chen appeared from around the corner. \"Mr. Jones?\" he said.\nHe looked at Kate and gestured politely for her to sit down. Then\nhe led Peter away, around the bend in the corridor. They sat\ndown.\n\n\"Mr. Jones, we need for you to name your daughter.\"\n\nNo name. Their baby girl had no name. This thought seemed to be\nthe final blow to drain him of his last ounce of energy. It was\nreal, and final. His life was changed now and forever. Somehow\nthe knapsack fell from his hands, its contents spilling onto the\nfloor. Kate. He had to ask her.\n\n\"Wait,\" he said to the doctor. He jumped to his feet and ran\naround the corner, calling out her name. But she was gone.\n\nHis shoulders slackened and he went back to the doctor, who was\ncollecting the contents that had spilled out of the knapsack.\nPeter bent down to take over. He was overcome by a wave of\ndizziness and the nausea. Then, just as abruptly, the spinning\nhalted and the sickness retreated, forced back by a keening sound\nthat arose in his throat.\n\nThere, among the clutter of notes and pens and the little black\nbox with its exposed circuits and wires, he found, written in her\nmother's own hand across the label of the topmost disk, their\nbaby's name.\n\n\"Isle,\" he whispered.\n\n\"Mr. Jones?\" the doctor said, not sure he had heard correctly.\n\n\"I said, Isle,\" Peter said, louder this time, taking the disks in\nhis hand. \"My daughter's name is Isle.\"\n\n\n\nPART IV\n\n\nChapter 17\n\n\n\"That's a good girl,\" Peter said, cradling the tiny Isle in his\narms. He checked her bottle. \"Almost done.\"\n\nFor one and a half months she had been home with Peter, deemed\nwell enough leave the hospital after a touch-and-go stay for the\nsame length of time. She weighed a scant six and a quarter\npounds. Her eyes were curious and alert, just like her mother's.\nPeter longed for her eyes to keep the clear sapphire color, a\nglittering reflection of Ivy. Isle's hair was beginning to\noutcrop in satiny brown whorls, the same color as her father's.\n\n\"Your little jewel,\" Grace said all smiles as she came into the\nliving room. \"Go ahead, I'll finish up with her.\"\n\n\"Okay, shrimp, over to Grace,\" Peter said, handing over the\nlittle pink bundle.\n\nPeter stood beaming at his infant in Grace's lap, her tiny mouth\npuckering the nipple of the bottle, tiny hands clutching and\nuncurling, tiny stocking feet kicking. So fragile, yet strong.\n\n\"Petey!\" Byron boomed from elsewhere in the house. \"Let's go!\"\n\n\"Better hurry before the bear comes out of his cave looking for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Coming,\" Peter called, and hurriedly kissed Isle's fuzzy head.\n\nHaving temporarily moved into Peter's California mansion since\nthey had come back from Maine after Isle's birth, the Holmeses\nhad been a godsend. Grace was all too happy to help out with\nIsle, and Byron and Peter had resumed their project. He had still\nnot seen or heard from Ivy, and she had refused his calls at the\ndetoxification clinic where she was recovering.\n\nByron and Peter and their small team worked all hours of the day\non the design they had settled on. The day Isle was born, Ivy had\nprovided him with the missing link, the distinct component that\nhe had been seeking. With the ISLE interface, they now had a\nmodel from which to refine the hardware, honing its design to\nprovide the ultimate platform, the perfect stage upon which Ivy's\ninvention could perform.\n\n\"Come here,\" Byron said enthusiastically, \"Get a look at this.\"\nHe was standing before a Joey Plus computer. It was connected to\na small, open black box filled with a convolution of wires,\ncircuits, and components. Peter stood beside his mentor in the\nmakeshift partitioned lab they had set up in one of the large\nbedrooms.\n\n\"We've got the agent tied in to the speech recognizer and it's\nworking like a charm. Here,\" Byron said, handing Peter a small\nmicrophone, \"tell it you want to make a date.\"\n\nPeter cleared his throat. \"Computer,\" he said, the keyword that\nthe ISLE speech recognizer listened for to carry out spoken\ncommands, \"lunch with Byron on Friday.\"\n\nOn the screen, a small month-view calendar opened and the\nupcoming Friday flashed. A moment later \"12:00PM Byron Holmes /\nLunch\" appeared in the date box.\n\nThe Joey Plus's built-in speaker came to life with a robotic\nvoice. \"Lunch with Byron Holmes, noon, confirmed. Is there an\nagenda?\"\n\nPeter grinned and looked at Byron, who lowered his voice. \"A\nlittle something we threw in this morning.\"\n\nPeter spoke into the microphone. \"Yes. Discuss computer\nenhancements and - \"\n\n\"Computer,\" the Joey said, interrupting Peter, \"is unrecognized.\"\n\nPeter gave Byron a puzzled look. \"What happened?\"\n\nByron was scratching his head. \"Well how do you like that. We\nnever considered that. I mean, that if we call the computer\n'computer,' then we can't use that word once it's listening to\nwhatever we tell it.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Peter said. \"Right. Hmm.\" He thought about this for a\nsecond, then sat down before the Joey and started typing.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Byron said.\n\n\"Well,\" Peter said, lifting the microphone, \"since the word\ncomputer won't compute, all we need to do is give it a unique\nname that we wouldn't normally use in an everyday context.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Byron said. \"Good thinking.\"\n\nPeter pressed a key and the Joey spoke: \"Please say my name so\nthat I know who I am.\"\n\n\"Pip,\" Peter said, loud and clear.\n\n\"Please repeat my name again, faster this time.\"\n\nPeter said the name faster. The Joey Plus asked him to repeat it\nonce more, slowly this time, so that it knew three slight\nvariations on of its own name, thereby making recognition more\naccurate.\n\n\"Pip?\" Byron asked.\n\n\"Sure,\" Peter said. \"Pip. Like in Dicken's \"Great Expectations.\"\nOne of my all-time favorite characters.\"\n\n\"Then Pip it is,\" Byron laughed. \"Let's give it a try.\"\n\nPeter repeated the test and the Joey Plus, a.k.a. Pip, pulled off\nthe scheduling task without a hitch.\n\n\"Well done,\" Peter said, congratulating Byron.\n\n\"That's nothing. We got the net lookup voice stuff working too.\"\n\n\"Hey, come look at this,\" Paul Trueblood said, appearing from\nbehind one of the partitions used to divide the huge room.\n\nPeter had contacted his two favorite engineers, Paul Trueblood\nand Rick Boardman, after he and Byron had relocated the project\nto California. During a dinner Peter had arranged, Byron had\ntalked about the ISLE vision, providing the engineers the\nopportunity to get to know him. Both were excited by what they\nheard, and the very next day both engineers resigned from Wallaby\nand returned to Peter's home, ready to dive into the project.\n\nIn one hand Paul held a short stylus pen, and in the other a flat\ndisplay unit that connected to another Joey Plus portable\ncomputer. With the stylus he began \"writing\" directly on the\ndisplay. As he scribbled, the computer converted his script\nhandwriting into clear text.\n\n\"Looking good,\" Peter said, watching the software do its thing\nquickly and accurately. \"Hey, no mistakes,\" he said when Paul\nfinished jotting down several lines. It took him a moment to\nrealize that what Paul had written were the lyrics to a song. A\nKate McGreggor song.\n\nByron applauded and, noticing Peter's ruminating, elbowed him.\n\n\"Good stuff, Paul,\" Peter said quietly.\n\n\"Hey, Ricky,\" Byron called, \"how'd you manage to speed up the\nrecognition so much?\"\n\nA smiling Rick peered over the edge of another nearby partition.\n\"You can thank my pals at MIT. They were kind enough to slip me\nsome new algorithms at that conference I went to last week,\" Rick\nsaid. \"It zips up the language translation stuff, too. Watch.\" He\npunched a few keys and the text on the display suddenly changed\nto Spanish, accents and all, then, a keystroke later, Cyrillic.\n\n\"Okay, come on now,\" Peter said with a clap, putting an end to\nthe show. \"We've only got another forty-five minutes,\" he said,\nchecking the clock on the wall. \"I want you guys to run through\nit once more to make sure there aren't any glitches.\"\n\n\"It's all working,\" Paul assured him, a little defensively. Just\nlike old times.\n\nPeter smiled. \"Okay, okay.\"\n\nByron said, \"We've got the whole works all ready to show him.\nIt's gonna knock his socks off.\"\n\nPeter had been skeptical about meeting Byron's old friend, who\nwas due to arrive shortly. However, trusting Byron's judgment, he\nhad ultimately given in.\n\n\"I hope so,\" Peter said, then, \"I'm going to check on Isle.\" He\nexcused himself.\n\n \"She's asleep,\" Grace whispered, glancing up from her book. Isle\nslept peacefully beside her on the sofa.\n\n\"Any calls?\" Peter said. The house and lab phones were on\nseparate lines, so that the men were not distracted while\nworking.\n\nGrace gave a sympathetic shake of her head.\n\nPeter had not heard from Kate since Isle's birth. He had called\nher the night she'd departed, and tried to persuade her to\nreturn. She had declined, and that was the last time they had\nspoken.\n\nHe now had Isle, and Byron and Grace, a family of sorts, and\nISLE. The project had crystallized into a wondrous thing. This\nafternoon's meeting could signal the beginning of something\ngreat, something bigger than anything he had ever done at\nWallaby. Yet, if he could, Peter would trade all of it to have\nKate back. If only he could undo his mistake...\n\nAs if reading his mind, the older woman laid a hand on his wrist.\n\"Petey, you can call her, you know.\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"I told her I would leave it up to her. That she's\neternally welcome, and we want her back. But I think I've lost\nher for good, Grace.\"\n\n\"Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. You know, after Byron had his heart\nattack, I almost left him.\"\n\n\"Really? How come?\"\n\n\"His pride. He felt so incapacitated by the fact that he couldn't\nhelp himself, and that he was nearing retirement, that he sort of\nturned against me. When he was bedridden, I set up a room in the\nhouse with all his favorite things, maps and model ships, books\nhe loved. But all he could do was reject my help, hurt me.\"\n\n\"But it's not the same.\"\n\n\"Isn't it? Didn't what happened between you and Ivy happen\nbecause you knew, in the back of your mind, that you were losing\ncontrol at Wallaby? And maybe you thought Kate would not want you\nonce that happened?\"\n\nPeter stared at her. What she said had never occurred to him, but\nwhen he considered it, it rang true.\n\n\"Petey, I know my husband better than anyone. And I know when I\nsee someone who's like him. I made a decision many years ago to\nbe his partner, till death do us part. We came close to breaking\nthat promise, until he told me one simple thing.\"\n\n\"I think I know what he said.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you say it?\"\n\nHe hesitated, then it. \"I was scared.\"\n\n\"And so was he. But when he told me, when he came right out and\nsaid it, I understood. Yes, it's different. Infidelity is harder\nto forgive. But if you tell her why, as you just told me, maybe\nshe'll give you a second chance.\"\n\n\"It's all so mixed up. There's the baby, and the project and\neverything going on today. I'm not sure now is the right time.\nEverything is so up in the air.\"\n\n\"But if she were back in your life, Peter, wouldn't these things\nseem a little more tolerable?\"\n\nHe looked at his baby. \"Yes,\" he said. \"You're right. I'll do it.\nI'll call her.\"\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nGreta walked into the bank and faced the long line of customers.\n\"Ugh,\" she sneered, settling her sunglasses in her hair.\n\nResigned, she labored to the end of the line, a dozen or so\npeople between her and the front. She fished through her purse,\nlooking for a stray form left over from a past visit. She found\nnone, and besides, she wasn't sure which form she needed anyway.\nThere has to be a better way, she thought, glancing anxiously at\nthe multitude of forms stacked on the podium beside the line.\nJust then, the branch manager appeared from a small room behind\nthe main counter, carrying a handful of papers in his hands. Ah!\nThere it was, a better way. She managed to catch his eye.\n\n\"Bruce! How are you?\" Greta said affectionately, catching him\nlightly by the arm.\n\n\"Well hello, Mrs. Locke. How are you?\" he said, patting her hand.\n\nShe leaned close to his ear. \"I was fine, until I walked into\nthis. It's becoming so difficult to bank.\"\n\nTaking advantage of her impairment, which, before falling in love\nwith Jean-Pierre, she would have never considered, she fluttered\nher four-fingered hand in the air. She sighed. \"Oh well.\"\n\nManaging to restrain his surprise, he glanced pensively at the\npapers in his hand, then at the woman who stood in front of\nGreta. Like the others in line, the woman's attention was fixed\non the front of the line. Greta read the young manager's mind\nwith delicious knowing: She is Matthew Locke's wife, with a\nhistory of enormous deposits. And very large balances. And, she\nknew, he had never before seen her disfigured hand. Pity.\n\nHe leaned closer. \"Wait over at my desk. I'll be finished with\nthis transaction in just a minute, then I'll take care of you.\"\n\nShe graced him with a thankful smile and casually strolled over\nto the manager's desk and seated herself. She opened her purse,\nbusied herself emptying old receipts and gum wrappers. A few\nminutes later the manager returned and seated himself opposite\nher. He collected her litter and, all business, discarded it in\nthe wastebasket beneath his desk. Clasping his hand together atop\nthe desk blotter, he beamed with anticipation, plainly expecting\na big deposit. \"Now, what is it I can do for you, Mrs. Locke?\"\n\nShe produced her checkbook and flattened it on the desk before\nher. \"I'd like to withdraw some of my funds,\" she said.\n\nHis expression seemed to flatten a little. \"How much would you\nlike to withdraw?\"\n\nShe looked from side to side, then leaned forward, her chin an\ninch above her poised pen. \"A quarter-million dollars,\" she\nwhispered.\n\n\"I see,\" he said, blinking, looking personally offended. \"Is\nthere something wrong with our service?\"\n\nShe gave a little laugh. \"Oh, no. No, no. You're always so kind\nand friendly. It's really not that much money - relatively\nspeaking,\" she said with a shake of her shoulders, a subtle\nreminder of their overall balance.\n\n\"From which account will you draw the funds?\" he asked, his\nfingers working quickly over the keyboard of the computer\nterminal beside the desk. \"Your personal checking account balance\nhere doesn't total that amount.\"\n\n\"I know. I'd like you to arrange to collect it from the market\nfund account, and then deposit it into this,\" she said,\nindicating the account number in her open checkbook. She unfolded\nthe small slip of paper Jean-Pierre had given her and showed it\nto the manager. \"Then I'll write a check, which I'd like wired to\nthis Swiss account.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mrs. Locke.\" He opened one of the desk drawers.\n\"We'll just need to fill out this form,\" he said, tearing off a\nsmall pink sheet. \"Are you and Mr. Locke traveling?\" he asked\ncasually as he transcribed her account number onto the form.\n\n\"Nope. Just me. It's to help set up affairs in Europe before I\ndepart for an extended trip.\"\n\nHe tapped the account number into the computer terminal and a\nmoment later the account activity unrolled on the display. \"Oh,\"\nhe said, frowning. \"Mrs. Locke, this is a joint account. I'm\nafraid we're going to need Mr. Locke's signature on this form\nbefore we can provide wire authorization.\"\n\nShe straightened. \"But the account is in my name,\" she said,\npuzzled.\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Locke,\" he said patiently, \"your checking account is\nin your name, but the funds are coming from your joint account\nwith Mr. Locke.\"\n\n\"But they are leaving from my account,\" she insisted, as if this\nmade a difference.\n\n\"Yes, they are, but to get into your account they must first come\nout of the market fund, which is in both names.\"\n\n\"Is there any other way?\" she said, distressed. \"I mean, It's\nreally such a small amount. Couldn't we just this once make it\nwork somehow?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not, Mrs. Locke. We must have Mr. Locke's signature\non this form before we can proceed with the transaction. I'm\nsorry.\"\n\nThe manager wrote an X beside the line that needed Matthew's\nsignature. \"Normally, Mr. Locke would have to appear in person.\nBut if you can just have him sign this and then come back with it\nbefore three o'clock, we can complete the transaction today.\"\n\nPulling out of the bank's parking lot she decided to drive to\nWallaby and have Matthew sign the form immediately. It was best\nto just get the whole transfer done and over with.\n\nWhen she had asked Jean-Pierre why he couldn't first go over to\nFrance and open a joint account in both their names, he had told\nher that this was the best way, something to do with interest\nrates and international rules and regulations and other things\nshe didn't understand, or care to know more about. The long and\nshort of it, according to Jean-Pierre, was that a delay would\ncause them to lose thousands of dollars in interest. He obviously\nknew what he was talking about, and she had agreed to do it his\nway. After all, she rationalized, it was for their future. And\nbesides, he had promised he would make no decisions without first\nconsulting her. This way, if he found something that they liked,\nhe would be able to act fast, securing the property quickly,\nwithout having to wait for signatures to arrive via slow,\ninternational means.\n\nShe pressed hard on the accelerator, hoping to catch Matthew\nwhile he ate lunch in his office, as he customarily did this time\nof day.\n\n\nChapter 18\n\n\n\"Matthew, it's all so positive,\" Laurence Maupin said with\nsmiling allegiance as she closed the copy of the \"Wall Street\nJournal\" resting on his desk. \"You've got the press in the palm\nof your hand these days.\"\n\n\"I'd say you've had more than a little to do with that.\"\n\n\"Just doing my job.\"\n\n\"And more,\" he said with a mischievous grin.\n\nHis secretary opened his office door and leaned in. \"Matthew,\nyour meeting with the executive staff has been moved to\none-thirty.\"\n\nHe thanked her and she returned to her desk. He closed the issue\nof \"Business Week\" he had been reading, which featured an article\nLaurence had pitched. He appraised his young assistant\nappreciatively as she flipped through a manila file folder. She\nlooked at him.\n\n\"How about some lunch?\" she asked, closing the folder.\n\n\"Sure. What are you up for?\"\n\n\"You pick.\"\n\n\"I haven't had sushi in a while.\"\n\nLaurence wrinkled her nose. \"Hmm. I've somehow managed to avoid\nsushi all these years. Well, I guess it's time I tried it.\"\n\n\"You'll love it,\" he said, escorting her out of his office. To\nhis secretary Eileen, he said, \"We're going next door for lunch.\"\n\nThey boarded the elevator. \"I'm curious as to why the executive\nstaff pulled together for a meeting this afternoon,\" Matthew\nsaid. \"No one has indicated a problem or situation of any sort to\nme.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's to congratulate you on the fact that the Joey II is\nshipping two months ahead of schedule, with thousands of orders\nwaiting to be filled.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" he said, without conviction. \"But we usually don't call\ntogether an executive staff meeting without some prior notice.\nAnd I'm usually the one to call them.\"\n\nThey crossed the Wallaby parking lot and walked along the\nsidewalk. \"Who did call this one?\" she asked.\n\nHe stopped in his tracks, and looked at her. \"You know, I don't\nknow,\" he said with mild astonishment. \"I hadn't thought about it\nuntil you just asked. I suppose it was Hank Towers.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't imagine it being anything but good. Things have\ngone up, up, up since you've taken control.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I can thank you for that too,\" he quipped, shifting the\ntopic from business to pleasure.\n\nShe touched her fingers to her lips to stifle a laugh as he\nopened the restaurant door for her. The Japanese hostess greeted\nthem with a bow, and indicated for them to follow her. She led\nthem into the dining area.\n\n\"I'd prefer a room in back,\" Matthew said when the hostess\npresented a table in the crowded general dining area, occupied\nmostly by Wallaby employees.\n\nShe nodded kindly and led them to the rear of the restaurant, to\none of the more private rooms, screened off from the rest of the\nplace with sliding rice paper and teakwood partitions.\n\n\"This is much better,\" Matthew said, stepping up to the low\nplatform. He and Laurence kicked off their shoes and handed them\nto the hostess, who placed them outside the private room. They\nseated themselves side by side in the sunken pit, facing the\nsliding door.\n\nThe door slid closed and they opened their menus. A moment later\nMatthew felt Laurence's stocking feet resting on top of his own.\n\nHe scanned the menu briefly then folded it. \"How about I order?\"\nhe said, noticing she was having some difficulty choosing among\nthe unusual dishes. \"Trust me,\" he said, and kissed her forehead.\n\nHe felt like a man on top of the world. This was how things\nshould be. In the past couple of months his wife had calmed down,\njust as he had known she would, and was off again doing her\nprojects and things. Whatever it was she was occupying her time\nwith he did not care, so long as she remained placated. As for\nher affair, he supposed she was still carrying on with it, but\nwith whom, and where, he could not say. Nor did he care.\n\nThe rice paper screen silently slid open, and the waitress\nentered carrying a tray. She handed them each a moist hot towel\nand filled their mugs with green tea, and Matthew recited their\norder.\n\nThe waitress exited, and he gave Laurence's knee a little\nsqueeze. \"Don't worry, I picked a nice variety. No appalling\nsurprises, I promise.\"\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\"Amazing!\" William Harrell said excitedly as the ISLE system\nlooked up a name he asked it to find in its sample phone\ndirectory. \"And what did you say ISLE stands for?\"\n\n\"Intelligent Speech and Language Environment.\"\n\n\"Right,\" William said. \"Tell me more about the recognition\ninterface.\"\n\n\"It was what really shifted our focus on this whole new design,\"\nPeter began. Byron, Paul, and Rick sat at the table also,\nlistening as Peter explained their design. \"We had already\ndecided that intelligent agents were the next big step in\nportable computers and devices, but it didn't seem like enough to\nus. We wanted more. And when we encountered the ISLE hardware and\nsoftware, the pieces just sort of fell in place.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment, picked up the small black box sitting on\nthe table before them. \"In its final configuration, this\ncircuitry will fit on one single PC card, that slides into one of\nthe portable's available slots. It contains the core recognition\nsoftware, speech synthesizer, and 74,000 word English language\nlibrary. The card's extra RAM stores up to 5,000 additional words,\nsuch as last names or companies or terms you commonly refer to.\nAdditional libraries, ones that are industry-specific, for\nexample, medical libraries, can be stored on another PC card, or\non the hard disk.\"\n\n\"Incredible,\" William said. \"But really, do people want this sort\nof interface? Will they really use it? In tests we conducted in\nour labs, we found that while users often asked for speech\nrecognition, few actually used it once we installed it on\nprototype systems. What makes this any different?\"\n\nPeter nodded in agreement. \"You're right. It's true. While people\nthink they want to be able to talk to a computer, have it take\ndictation, we believe what they really want is to give it simple\ncommands to make certain small tasks simpler. But listen, instead\nof telling you all of this, why don't we show you instead. Guys?\"\n\nPaul and Rick arranged the hackneyed Joey Plus computer in front\nof William and Peter handed him a microphone.\n\n\"In a final product,\" Peter said, \"we'll of course build-in a\nmicrophone for hand's free operation.\" He hit a few keys. \"Now,\nsay you are driving in your car and you remember that you need to\nsend an e-mail or fax to an associate to confirm an upcoming\nappointment.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" William said. \"How do I start.\"\n\n\"Do what comes naturally.\"\n\nWilliam thought about this for a second then spoke into the\nmicrophone. \"Pip, create an e-mail.\"\n\nThe Joey's hard disk was busy for an instant and then a blank\ne-mail form popped up on the screen. The Joey said, \"To whom?\"\n\nWilliam turned to Byron with wide eyes. Byron nodded and\nwhispered, \"Go on, give the little fella what he's asking for.\"\n\nWilliam said: \"Peter.\"\n\nJoey: \"Peter Jones? Or Peter Smith?\"\n\n\"Peter Jones,\" William said, then he covered the microphone and\nwas about to say something, but Peter anticipated his question\nbefore he could ask it.\n\n\"That's the agent at work, behind the scenes. It found two Peters\nin the address book and didn't know which one you wanted, so it\nasked you to decide.\"\n\nThe Joey filled in the 'To:' field and skipped to the next line.\nIt had already filled in the 'From:' and 'Date:' fields\nautomatically.\n\n\"Subject?\" the Joey said.\n\n\"Meeting confirmation.\"\n\nThe Joey considered this for a few seconds and then the monthly\ncalendar view appeared on the screen, layered above the e-mail\nform.\n\n\"Do you mean your meeting scheduled for this Friday?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe Joey automatically keyed in the subject field with: \"Meeting\nConfirmation, July sixth.\"\n\n\"Dear Peter,\" the Joey said, then \"Please begin your message,\nWilliam.\"\n\nWilliam recited a brief note, saying that he was looking forward\nto the upcoming meeting. When he was done, he covered the\nmicrophone with his hand again and turned to Byron. \"How do I\ntell it I'm done?\"\n\n\"Just say it's name first, and it will know that you want to give\nit a command. That's why we named this one Pip. It's a word it\nwould probably never encounter in your normal correspondence and\nso it knows that you are talking to it, rather than giving it\ntext to put on the screen.\"\n\n\"Pip,\" William said into the mic, \"That's all.\"\n\nThe Joey did not respond.\n\n\"Pip,\" William tried again, \"Thank you.\"\n\nNothing.\n\nWilliam looked at Peter, who looked at Rick.\n\n\"What's the word for done,\" Peter said.\n\n\"Done,\" Rick said. \"Looks like we'd better put in a few more ways\nof saying done,\" he said, scribbling a note to himself.\n\nWilliam said, \"Pip: done.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" the Joey said. \"Shall I send this fax now or later?\"\n\n\"Now,\" William said. He looked at Peter. \"Is that okay.\"\n\nPeter nodded.\n\n\"Sending,\" the Joey said. A few moments later the portable's\nbuilt-in modem dialed the phone line plugged into it. They heard\nthe line ring through the computer's speaker, and a half-second\nlater the fax machine in the workroom rang. It picked up on the\nnext ring, and William got up and went over to it. The fax he had\njust dictated, properly dated and addressed, whispered out of the\nfax machine and lay in the tray, complete. William picked it up\nand let out a pleased whistle. He heard two beeps behind him and\nhe turned around.\n\n\"Fax transmission complete,\" the Joey said.\n\n\"Pip,\" William said, \"thank you.\"\n\n\"You're welcome, William,\" the Joey said.\n\nWilliam laughed and shook his head. \"Incredible,\" he said. He\nswitched off the microphone and laid it down on the table. \"Well,\nI guess that proves your point. You're right. For simple\nbusy-work like sending a fax or creating an e-mail, being able to\nspeak to the computer directly does make the job easier.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Peter said. \"And some people will use it for longer\ndocuments, like a traditional dictation system, but without the\nneed to transcribe it. And in order to avoid being interrupted in\nthe middle of your brainstorm it will wait until you are done to\nask you to clarify any words it did not understand.\"\n\n\"What about the handwriting stuff,\" William said.\n\n\"That's another enhancement,\" Peter said, ready to explain how it\nfit in with the rest of the product. But just then, Grace came\ninto the room.\n\n \"Come on, boys, lunch is ready.\"\n\nThe men stood and stretched, and Peter went on as they headed out\nof the room. \"Like the speech interface, we think the handwriting\nrecognition, which we've vastly improved over the standard Joey\nversion, will be used for smaller tasks, jotting down notes and\ncontact information, that sort of thing. But not necessarily for\nwriting long letters. For that, they can use the keyboard.\nHowever, for editing an existing document, using the stylus like\na red pen to mark up the page and scribble in corrections or move\ntext around, we've put in standard editor pen-strokes to make\nrevisions a snap.\"\n\nWilliam removed his glasses. \"It's amazing. The way these\nenhancements - the agent technology, and the speech and improved\nhandwriting recognition - have upped the ante, making an already\npretty smart portable system truly intelligent.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Peter said. \"And the vertical application possibilities\nare endless. Publishing, using the editorial mark-up features I\ndescribed. And any business that relies on forms. We're already\ncollaborating with a doctor friend of mine at Stanford,\" Peter\nsaid enthusiastically. \"She's building a system that lets doctors\nand nurses track patients' vital signs and prescription orders on\na prototype system we've hacked together for her.\"\n\nThe group seated themselves around the dining table, with Peter\nand William sitting side by side.\n\nWilliam said, \"But what about the computer itself? I see you've\ncracked open a few Joeys in there and put in your own custom\nhardware. Is that how you intend to deliver the product? As a\nJoey peripheral?\"\n\nPeter let out a big sigh on this one. \"That's a good question.\nOne I tend to get a little too worked up over. See, I want to do\nour own thing. It would take longer, but it would be ours, and\nnot a part of Wallaby's. Let's just say I'm still a little\nsensitive on the subject. Byron, why don't you handle that one.\"\nGrace handed Isle to Peter and he gently rocked her in his arms.\n\n\"She's precious,\" William said. \"I didn't know you were a\nfather.\"\n\n\"Yep,\" Peter said. \"Her name is Isle. She's the little jewel\nbehind everything you just saw.\" He kissed her fuzzy head.\n\nByron took a sip of his water and addressed William's question.\n\"That's not a bad idea, Billy. Petey and I have been talking\nabout it between us, and we're not exactly sure how we're going\nto deliver the final product. We could do it as a Joey add-on. Or\nwe could create our own new computer. That Joey in there that you\nwere playing with is only the basic guts. For more reliable net\nand web access, we've slipped in a faster, 28.8 KB modem with a\nwireless option so you can send and receive e-mails or do paging\nthrough the airwaves, without plugging into a phone line. And\nwe've come up with a sharper, lower-power thin-film transistor\ndisplay, a longer-life battery pack, and an infrared port too,\nthat lets you beam information to your desktop system or to other\nJoeys and IR devices, like printers, or hell, to your TV even,\nwhen we get the home-entertainment interface software we're\nkicking around up and running.\"\n\nWilliam put down his fork and took a sip of his water. \"Well,\nthere is another option that you have not mentioned.\" He paused.\n\"You could integrate the ISLE design into a next-generation ICP\nproduct.\"\n\nEveryone around the table stopped and looked at him. Then they\nlooked at Peter.\n\nPeter, gently rocking Isle in his lap, looked at Byron. Then he\nturned to William, and he smiled.\n\n\"Now there's an interesting idea.\"\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nShe pulled into a handicapped parking space beside Matthew's car,\nthen flashed her Wallaby VIP badge to the security guard sitting\nbehind the lobby desk. Matthew had gotten the pass for her a few\nyears ago, after she had once been accosted by security when she\nhad arrived and marched right past the desk carrying a basket of\nflowers, a surprise for her husband. As far as she was concerned,\nshe was still the boss's wife, and she could go anywhere she damn\nwell pleased. She ignored the guard's pleasantries and boarded\nthe elevator. A moment later the door parted, and she was on the\ntop floor.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Mrs. Locke,\" a handsome receptionist said\ncheerfully.\n\n\"Hello, Sheldon,\" Greta said with an effusive smile. Such a\ncharming young man. He knew how to treat a distinguished woman.\nAs she headed away, her peripheral vision caught the young man\nlifting the telephone handset, warning the executive secretaries\nthat she was on her way.\n\nSo well trained, she thought, a sudden hush falling over the\nexecutive area. As she marched along the row of offices, each of\nthe secretaries graced her with a smile and a greeting.\n\n\"Greta,\" Matthew's secretary Eileen said with deliberate\nflatness.\n\nGreta marched past her desk without so much as a glance and went\nstraight into her husband's office.\n\nEileen came in behind her. \"He's gone to lunch next door,\" she\nsaid. \"Can I help you with something?\"\n\nLingering for a few moments, she examined several documents on\nMatthew's desk with feigned interest. Satisfied, she cleared her\nthroat and walked out of the office. Neither of the two women\nwished the other any sort of day, good, bad or otherwise.\n\nShe made her way back to the elevators.\n\nThe elevator rang, and someone ran past her and boarded it.\n\"Please hold that,\" she called out. Taking her time to reach the\nelevator, a pleasurable knowledge swept through her; whoever the\nperson in the elevator was, he or she would hold the door for\nher.\n\n\"Thank you, dear,\" she said to the young man aboard the elevator.\nBecause she had participated in all of Wallaby's major functions,\nwhether on stage with Matthew as he wished the employees season's\ngreetings, or during congratulatory speeches and celebration\nevents, everyone in the company recognized Greta Locke - the\nhead-honcho's wife.\n\nReveling in this notoriety, she strolled into the sushi\nrestaurant and searched among the tables for her husband.\nConversations quieted among the diners as they noticed her. Mrs.\nMatthew Locke pretended indifference to the attention she drew as\nshe started through the dining area and headed for the back room,\nwhere on past occasions she and Matthew had dined with some of\nthe other Wallaby executives and their wives.\n\n\"May I help you?\" the hostess inquired politely, treading\nalongside Greta.\n\n\"I know my way around,\" Greta said. She went in back and stopped\nbefore the group of private partitioned rooms. The doors to three\nof the intimate little rooms were open, and she could see they\nwere empty. She went for the first closed door, but just before\nsliding it open she noticed Matthew's shoes, as well as a pair of\nheels, sitting on the floor by the last room, which overlooked\nthe carp pond at the restaurant's atrium center.\n\nAs she neared the room, she heard Matthew's voice. \"Here, try\nthis one,\" then a foolish giggle, presumably belonging to whoever\nit was who fit into such tiny heels.\n\nGreta stepped up to the platform and slid the door open, just in\ntime to see Matthew, chopsticks in hand, placing a dripping pink\npiece of raw fish into the mouth of a young pretty thing. The\ngirl sat with her eyes closed and head titled back slightly,\nwriggled her tongue in anticipation. Matthew's other hand was\nhidden beneath the girl's hair, supporting her neck.\n\nLooking up and encountering his wife's stunned expression,\nMatthew jerked impulsively, and in doing so plunged the chunk of\nraw fish into the girl's mouth. Her eyes snapped open, and she\nmade a revolting sound. Her hands flew to her throat. She was\nchoking.\n\nMatthew struck the girl sharply on the back, and with a great\npopping cough, the pink thing flew from her mouth into her cupped\nhand.\n\nSeeing that the girl's airway was free, Matthew turned to his\nwife. Getting up, his napkin fell into the tray of sushi. As he\nreached for it, his feet encountered an obstacle, and in an\neffort to prevent himself from crashing through the window, he\ncaught the edge of the table, managing to tip over their mugs of\ntea, as well as knock most of the remaining sushi onto the floor.\n\n\"Sit down, Matthew,\" Greta said with a disgusted flap of her\nhand. She gave him a look. \"I must say, darling, I'm very\nimpressed with your technique. I would have thought you'd need a\nhook to catch this sort of fish.\"\n\nThe girl sucked deep gulps of air, alternating her wide,\nwatery-eyed gape between husband and wife.\n\n\"Poor thing, so sorry you don't care for the selection,\" Greta\nsaid with a pout. \"I think there's some more on the floor. Go\nfetch, dearie.\"\n\n\"Greta,\" Matthew snapped, \"close that door!\"\n\n\"Oh, relax, Matthew. This will only take a minute. However,\" she\nsaid, seating herself in the pit across from them, \"I'm not\nleaving until I see this live one swim through a hoop and catch a\nchunk of that bait in the air.\"\n\nMatthew glared at his wife as she opened her purse and withdrew\nthe pink bank form.\n\n\"This is Laurence Maupin,\" Matthew said, attempting to explain\nhimself. \"She's my public relations assistant.\"\n\nIgnoring the girl's flawless extended hand, Greta slid aside the\ntray and dropped the form on the table before Matthew. She made\nsure to use her left hand.\n\nThe door slid open and the hostess poked her head in. \"Would you\nlike a menu?\" she asked graciously.\n\n\"Go away,\" Greta snapped. The door slid closed.\n\n\"We were just going over some notes,\" Matthew said, still\nindulging in his farce. \"For a speech I'll be giving in a few\nweeks.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" Greta said. \"And where will you be speaking,\nMatthew, Sea World?\n\nMore composed now, Laurence eyed her tormentor with plain\ncontempt. \"This is not what you think, Mrs. Locke,\" she said.\n\n\"Butt out. This business is between my husband and I.\" She\nflicked the form into Matthew's lap, then slapped a gold pen down\non the table. \"Sign it.\"\n\n\"Greta! This is for a quarter-million dollars,\" he said, his\nvoice disbelieving. \"What the hell are you doing?\"\n\nShe gave her husband an impatient look. \"Matthew, either you shut\nup and sign that, or I walk out there and announce your fishy\nlittle affair with Flipper here.\"\n\nHe considered this, looked down at the form. \"I hope you know\nwhat you're doing,\" he said, and picked up the pen.\n\n\"What the hell is so funny?\" Greta asked, noticing Laurence's\napparently merry expression as she watched Matthew's hand\nsquiggling across the form. For the briefest instant, Laurence's\nsmile intensified when she met Greta's eyes. At this stare-down,\nGreta lost.\n\nMatthew shoved the pen and the transfer document across the\ntable, then crossed his arms and stared down at the ruined lunch\nlike an angry child.\n\nGreta collected the form and folded it neatly, a triumphant smile\non her face. Matthew shook his head in disgust as the slip\ndisappeared into her purse with a snap. His anger was complete.\nAt this point he was only thankful she was leaving immediately,\nwithout causing him any further embarrassment.\n\n\"I'm so sorry I can't stay to see the rest of the show - \" Greta\nstarted, calmly.\n\nOr so he thought.\n\n\"I'll especially hate missing the part where you balance his\nballs on your nose.\"\n\nMatthew lunged for her, but she escaped his grasp with a titter\nand left the room, not bothering to close the door. She swept\npast the mute diners, her victory plain for everyone to see. She\neven paused at the door for a moment to take a few mints at the\nhostess desk.\n\nBut when she pressed through the doors, leaving her stunned\naudience behind, she felt strangely unmasked in the bright\nsunlight. Something inside her shifted, and her elation quickly\ndrained.\n\nShe was overcome by a sudden panic. And then it hit her. Was this\nher last hurrah? Would that young girl take over her reign as\nMrs. Matthew Locke? she wondered covetously.\n\nShe pressed her fist to her mouth and forced herself to\nconcentrate on her task at hand. She had to get to the bank with\nthe signed transfer. Then she would feel better. Yes, she told\nherself, catching Matthew with his little tart would strengthen\nher decision, would reassure her. She couldn't wait to tell\nJean-Pierre she had caught him, red-handed.\n\nBut this small euphoria was as short-lived as the last. As she\nraced up the highway, a disturbing realization mocked her,\nprodding obscenely at her sensibility. That all this time,\ncontrary to her reasoning, Matthew had had the capacity to love\nmore than Wallaby, and he had chosen to share it not with her,\nbut with another woman.\n\n\nChapter 19\n\n\n\"Then we have a tentative agreement,\" William said with plain\nsatisfaction in his voice. Isle lay slanted across his knees, her\ntiny hand now and then batting his tie.\n\nPeter and Byron, seated on a sofa, both nodded in agreement.\n\n\"Wonderful,\" William said. \"You hear that, young lady? Your name\nis going to be famous!\" As if on cue the baby yawned, and\neveryone laughed.\n\n\"Speaking of tired, you men must be working yourselves to the\nbone with all the progress you've made,\" William said, handling\nIsle to Peter. \"When do you expect to have a final design?\"\n\nByron considered for a moment. \"The hardware design is nearly\ncomplete. We've got a lot of software work to do. Six months?\"\nByron ventured, turning to Peter.\n\n\"If you say so, chief,\" Peter said. \"We'll need some engineers,\nadministrative support, that kind of stuff.\"\n\nWilliam assured the men that he would get them whatever they\nneeded to see their project through to completion as quickly as\npossible.\n\nPeter was nearly satisfied, but there was one last thing he\nwanted to clarify. \"What about the strategic alliance?\"\n\n\"That stays, for now.\" William said, then: \"But when the ISLE\nsystem is ready for production, we'll be less dependent on\nWallaby. There's an important difference between what we've got\nwith Wallaby, and what we are proposing for ISLE. With this, ICP\nwill have invested hard cash in your baby. So don't worry, we'll\nsee to it that she's a success.\"\n\n \"Then we're on,\" Byron said.\n\nWilliam beamed. \"Excellent,\" he said. He checked his watch. \"I'd\nbetter get moving if I'm going to catch my plane.\" The trio\nwalked to the door together. They shook hands, and William\ndeparted.\n\n\"You see, Petey,\" Byron said after closing the door, \"the big\nguys aren't all so bad after all, eh?\"\n\n\"I like him,\" Peter admitted.\n\n\"Man, we've sure got our work cut out for us. I just hope we\ndon't have any setbacks.\"\n\n\"How did it go?\" Grace asked.\n\nByron kissed her on the cheek. \"Like a charm.\"\n\n\"Congratulations,\" she said. \"Peter, this man called while you\nguys were out in the yard.\" She traded a Post-it note for Isle.\nThere was a name written on it that Peter did not recognize, and\na phone number. \"Thanks. I'll call him later. Let's go tell the\nguys the good news.\"\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\"Did Greta find you?\" Eileen asked, rising from her chair as\nMatthew returned from lunch.\n\n\"She found me, all right,\" Matthew said, winded, rushing past her\nand into his office. He gathered his pen and notepad and hurried\nto the boardroom. There was only a minute to spare before the\nmeeting began.\n\nThe entire Wallaby executive staff was seated around the table.\n\"Good afternoon,\" Matthew said, sweeping the group with a smile.\nFor an instant their inexpressive faces reminded him of the day\nthey had voted Peter Jones from the company, and the hairs on the\nback of his neck tingled as he seated himself at the head of the\ntable.\n\nAll eyes drifted to the assistant chairman, Hank Towers.\n\n\"Matthew,\" he started affably, \"we're all pleased with the large\nvolume of sales orders for the new Joey II.\"\n\nA few heads nodded. A smile here, another there. The room seemed\nto loosen a little, and Matthew smiled broadly. Laurence had been\ncorrect. The meeting had been called to applaud his success with\nthe Joey II, and the strategic alliance with ICP.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Matthew said modestly. Then he became serious,\nscanning the room expertly, locking briefly on each person's\neyes. \"But I couldn't have done it without all of you.\"\n\nNods. A few brief smiles of genuine affection. Then all eyes\ngravitated once more to Hank Towers. There was an unsettling air\nof deference, protocol.\n\n\"Matthew, you've been very busy with the ICP alliance,\" Hank\nsaid, \"which is perfectly understandable. So the executives and I\nhave been working on our three-year plan.\"\n\nMatthew nodded.\n\n\"However,\" Hank said, \"there is some concern among us,\nparticularly in the area of future product engineering.\"\n\nMatthew glanced at Alan Parker, who had been Matthew's assistant\nin getting the Joey division back on track after Peter's\nejection. Alan had directed the reorganization of the Mate and\nJoey divisions, and managed the day-to-day development\noperations, while Matthew had championed the project's overall\nmission of delivering the new Joey Plus, then the Joey II, to the\npublic. At present, Parker seemed to be very interested in his\ndisposable pen.\n\n\"What kind of concerns?\" Matthew said, relieved to hear that his\nown voice sounded authoritative.\n\nHank said, \"With the work we've all done, focusing on the Joey\nPlus, and especially the II, none of us had much time to think\nabout the future. Now that you've gotten the Joey II out the\ndoor, we've come to an important realization. Matthew, the truth\nof the matter is we have no realistic three-year plan.\"\n\n \"What do you mean no plan?\" Matthew said, his voice splintering\nin mid-sentence. It was as if he were being shaken awake while in\nthe midst of a pleasurable dream, suddenly confronted with the\nbafflement that comes with the knowledge that it was just that, a\ndream. Because he had spent all his time securing the alliance\nwith ICP, he had never considered what Wallaby would think about\nafter the relationship was announced.\n\nActually, he thought in the silence of the room, that was not\naltogether correct. In truth, he had not cared about what Wallaby\nwould face after the ICP strategic alliance, because after that,\naccording to the original plan, ICP would have bought Wallaby,\nand the future strategy would have become their concern. At that\nstage he would have been protected behind his big desk in his\nluxurious, apartment-sized office. How could he have made such a\nsimple oversight? After contacting William to cancel the final\nstage of the eventual merger, hadn't he realized that following\nthe Joey II, there would have to come new, future products from\nthe innovative Wallaby?\n\nSometime during his reverie, the meeting had resumed.\n\n\"...among us is an awareness that we're all but succumbing to ICP\nas a maker of compatible systems. Our days as a radical portable\ncomputer company, a company for the people, may be over.\"\n\nAs Matthew considered this implication, that he had crumbled\ntheir fairy-tale company by moving them successfully into big\nbusiness, he felt as though he were somehow slipping back in\ntime, to the meeting in which he had forced out Peter Jones. Only\nthis time, he was playing the part of Peter. Wasn't that what he\nhad always wanted?\n\n\"Each one of you,\" he charged, sweeping his index finger around\nthe table, \"approved our plan to build systems that could tie-in\nto ICP's computers and share the same information!\" He stood up,\nshoved his hands into his pockets.\n\n\"We did,\" Hank said calmly, speaking on the group's behalf. \"As\nwell as granting you the authority to run the shop. And all this\nroom wants to hear is that you've got a product strategy, a\nvision, that goes beyond where we are today.\"\n\n\"Of course I have a plan,\" Matthew said indignantly. \"We will\nevolve the Joey II, incorporating more powerful features.\" His\nvoice turned shrill. \"ICP is at our mercy. Think about it! The\norders indicate that we are now the maker on the rise, that Joey\nis the one that people want for doing their work and accessing\nother systems, if even those systems are ICP's!\"\n\n\"Matthew, be realistic,\" Hank said. \"ICP could drop our\narrangement at a moment's notice and introduce their own system.\"\nHis manner became grave. \"Or worse.\"\n\nMatthew pressed his hands flat on the table, ready to challenge\nthe group's faithlessness. \"Worse? What worse?\"\n\n\"Denise?\" Hank said with a deferential nod to Denise Campbell,\nWallaby's chief financial officer.\n\n\"There's a rumor circulating\" Denise said. \"Supposedly one of our\nengineers heard from his former colleague, Paul Trueblood, that\nJones was demonstrating some new product to an official from ICP\ntoday.\"\n\nMatthew paled. ICP? William Harrell? Was it possible that William\nhad teamed with Peter in the few short months since Matthew had\npulled the plug on the acquisition plan?\n\n\"That's what could be worse,\" Hank said. \"In my estimation, it's\npossibly the worst thing that could happen to Wallaby. Our own\nfounder leaves and builds a product that directly competes with\nhis own invention.\"\n\nThey all stared at him, waiting. If he didn't think quickly,\nthere was going to be another vote. \"But the ICP alliance is our\nvision,\" Matthew said, groping for a solution.\n\nHank met this revelation with a gentle shake of his head. He\nlooked down at his leather portfolio, at some notes. \"Matthew,\"\nhe started, sounding very tired.\n\nIf he didn't come up with something in the next few seconds,\nMatthew knew they would be asked to place their ballots.\nResorting to the thing that had brought him to Wallaby in the\nfirst place, he decided his only chance was to resurrect his\noriginal secret plan.\n\n\"Wait,\" he blurted, cutting off Hank before he could continue. \"I\nhave a solution,\" he said, trying to sound confident. \"I propose\nthat we merge with ICP.\"\n\nTheir faces around the table disclosed either total confusion or\ntotal shock. Hank gave an astonished chuckle. \"What on earth\nmakes you think we would do a crazy thing like that? Or that they\nwould?\"\n\n\"They would, and they will,\" Matthew said firmly. \"When we\nannounced the strategic alliance, William Harrell had expressed\nICP's interest in possibly merging our companies. I told him we\nweren't interested,\" he said, shifting the details to accommodate\nhis story. A funny feeling hit him just then. That regardless of\ntoday's outcome, the act of finally revealing his compulsion felt\nlike a great weight off his shoulders. At least his original plan\nwas no longer a secret.\n\n\"Why weren't we told of this?\" Hank demanded.\n\n\"I didn't seriously think it would be something any of us would\nwant,\" Matthew said. \"Harrell knew he couldn't acquire us without\nour consent, so I never feared a hostile takeover. An attempt to\ncreate a monopoly would be prevented by the FTC, and more\nseriously, the employees would rally against it, and our culture\nwould be lost.\"\n\n\"But that's just it, Matthew,\" Hank said. \"Without any real\nfuture products in the pipeline our culture is essentially\ndoomed. You've succeeded in convincing the employees that\ncoexisting with ICP was the right thing to do. No one has given\nback their profit-sharing checks, for crying out loud.\"\n\n\"Hank, this is business, not a fraternity. Business is sales, and\nwe're finally making them, big time. Why not go all the way with\nit? We're a grown-up company now, in with the big boys.\"\n\nIf Wallaby were to merge with ICP, no one seated around the table\nwould have a financial care in the world. Their stock options\nwould stack additional millions upon the millions most of them\nhad already accrued. And looking around the room, at the\ncalculating faces, he knew that that was exactly what each was\nthinking. All except Hank.\n\n\"Now then,\" Matthew said, \"I propose we vote. How many people\nwould agree to the initiation of a merger with ICP?\"\n\n\"It would mean the end of Wallaby,\" Hank said gravely.\n\n\"No, Hank,\" Matthew countered, turning to face him. \"It's just\nthe beginning. ICP would sell millions more Joeys then we ever\ncould.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Hank said. \"You just said it yourself. ICP would sell.\nNo more Wallaby.\"\n\nAs far as Matthew was concerned, it was all the same. He would\nassuredly be named president of the Wallaby subsidiary, just as\nhe and William had planned almost three years ago. And the\nthought of eventually taking over William's role at ICP held\nenormous appeal again, as it once had. He locked onto this as his\nnew goal.\n\n\"All in favor of me contacting William Harrell and proposing the\nmerger of ICP and Wallaby, please raise your hands.\" His own hand\nstretched so high it hurt his side.\n\n\"We'll have to get full board approval,\" Hank warned, one last\neffort to counter Matthew's proposition.\n\nMatthew said, \"When they find out that Peter has been talking to\nICP, I don't see how they can object. Now, all in favor, please\nraise your hands.\"\n\nThe room teetered on the edge of absolute stillness.\n\nThen, slowly at first, hands rose. One after another, every\nperson in the room raised his or her hand - except Hank Towers.\n\nOnce more, all eyes were on him.\n\nSlowly, he lifted his open palm, held it there briefly, then\nstood and left the room.\n\n\"Very well,\" Matthew said and lowered his hand. The others\nfollowed suit then silently gathered their things and left the\nroom.\n\nAll alone now, he lowered himself to a chair with an exhausted\nsigh. He had done it again. First Peter. Then the strategic\nalliance. Now the merger. An agreeable sensation of vengeance\nwashed through him when he thought about Peter Jones and whatever\nplan he had up his own sleeve. For the second time he had voted\nPeter out, crushing whatever his secret scheme with ICP might\nhave been.\n\nBut then he was hit by a sudden troubling thought. What if\nPeter's new project actually was superior to Joey? What if\nWilliam no longer wanted Wallaby? What if the two had already\ndecided to do business together?\n\nHe bolted from his chair and raced from the board room. He had to\nhurry and try to reach William after he was through with Peter\nJones, even if that meant intercepting him at the airport.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nShe had considered driving straight to Jean-Pierre's after\nfinishing her business with the bank, but decided instead to drop\nthe car at home first and walk to his cottage. The stroll and the\nfresh air would calm her.\n\nIn her tight fist she carried the receipt from the funds\ntransferred to Jean-Pierre's Swiss account. Transaction complete.\nVery soon she would find herself strolling to their own stable on\ntheir own ranch, with as many horses as she wanted. She\nenvisioned a large property with a simple, stately home, the\nstable not far from her own back door, nestled among the rolling\nhills where she and Jean-Pierre would ride.\n\nShe rounded the bend of the path that opened onto the ranch.\nThere were a few riders tramping out to the hills, a trainer in\nthe ring was instructing a young student. Jennifer spotted her\nand waved from her doorstep just before going inside. Greta\nreturned the greeting with a wide, happy sweep of her arm.\n\nShe doesn't even know, Greta thought. For that matter, no one\nknew about her and Jean-Pierre. They had been discreet with the\naffair, seeing each other when Matthew was out of town, which had\nbeen often in the past months. She still rode almost every\nmorning, and often Jean-Pierre joined her. Together they would\nhunt out a secluded spot in the hills with a beautiful view,\ndismount from their horses, and make love.\n\nYes, that was how it would be almost every day in her new life\nwith Jean-Pierre. As she approached the rear of his cottage, she\nnoticed the drawn curtains on his bedroom window. Was he napping?\nShe knocked, but there was only silence.\n\nShe twisted the doorknob. It was unlocked, and she decided to let\nherself in - just as the door was jerked from her hand as it\nswung inward.\n\nThe girl from the sushi restaurant stood there, shocked.\n\n\"You!\" Greta screeched.\n\nLaurence took a terrified step backward and attempted to swing\nthe door shut in Greta's face.\n\nGreta charged and trapped the girl between herself and the\nkitchen table. \"What are you doing here?\" she screamed.\n\nLaurence lifted her hands to protect herself, just as Jean-Pierre\nrushed in from the other room and stepped between them.\n\n\"Greta, wait,\" he pleaded, grabbing Greta by the shoulder.\n\"Laurence is one of my students.\"\n\n\"What?\" Greta said, turning to him with a confused and\nexasperated expression, the girl temporarily forgotten.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"In fact, it was your husband who referred her to\nthe ranch, knowing that you kept your horse here. Please, let go\nof her darling. Come inside. Let me get you something? He spoke\nas if he were entertaining guests, three old friends gathering\nfor lunch.\n\nLaurence had managed to extricate herself from the threesome, and\nwas presently collecting her bag.\n\n\"She\" Greta said, \"is having an affair with my husband.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Jean-Pierre said indifferently.\n\n\"You knew?\"\n\n\"No, I said I know. She just told me now. She was so upset that\nshe stopped off to tell me she wasn't going to take her lesson\nthis evening, because of what happened at the restaurant.\"\n\n\"And she'll be leaving, right now,\" Greta said.\n\n\"I was just going,\" Laurence said with a show of dignity.\n\n\"I've had enough of your face for one day,\" Greta said, edging\ntoward her.\n\n\"The feeling is mutual, Mrs. Locke,\" Laurence replied with a\nsmirk. Then, \"I must say, after finally meeting you in person, I\ncan stop feeling guilty about my relationship with Matthew.\" She\nbrushed a long wayward lock of hair from her face. \"You, madam,\nand I use the term generously, are a quintessential bitch.\"\n\nGreta's mouth gaped. \"You little tramp!\" She lunged for\nLaurence's throat.\n\n\"Stop,\" Jean-Pierre commanded, catching Greta by the waist just\nin time. \"Go,\" he said to Laurence.\n\n\"I don't ever want to see you again!\" Greta shouted after the\ngirl.\n\nLaurence climbed into her car and slammed the door shut, started\nthe engine, and rolled down the window. She look as though she\nwere about to shout a retort, but then she thought the better of\nit. Or so it seemed, until she lifted her closed fist and ever so\nslowly raised her middle finger at Greta.\n\nGreta made another lunge for the girl but Jean-Pierre's hold on\nher was too strong to break away.\n\nLaurence laughed heartily at this little show of helplessness,\nthen gunned the engine and she raced away in her BMW, kicking up\na great cloud of dust in her wake.\n\nJean-Pierre pulled Greta inside and closed the door. Before she\ncould say anything, his mouth was on hers. She struggled out of\nhis grip and fixed her shoulders squarely against the door.\n\n\"What is this - what the hell is going on here, Jean-Pierre? I\ndon't like the way this looks.\"\n\nHe considered her with some amusement, gave her his sexy look.\n\n\"What the hell's so funny?\" she said. He touched his finger to\nher little horseshoe charm and her breath caught and held, and\nshe felt at once like she wanted to hit him and kiss him.\n\n\"You are, Greta. You are overreacting,\" he said, leaning closer.\nHe kissed the charm, his breath hot on her throat, then lower.\n\nHis touch was distorting whatever semblance of perspective she\nhad - she was so confused. She shook herself from him and pressed\nhim back with both fists. \"Wait. Stop. Just what do you expect me\nto think? One minute that little bitch is sucking tuna fish off\nmy husband's fingers, the next she's traipsing out your front\ndoor!\"\n\n\"I don't expect you to think what you're thinking,\" he said\ncalmly. Too calm, she was beginning to see, to be guilty.\n\n\"But Jean-Pierre,\" Greta said, still not sure, \"why haven't you\ntold me about her?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"What is there to tell?\" He took her wrists in his\nhands. \"Do you really think she and I are something?\"\n\n\"She's very pretty,\" Greta said. \"And very young.\"\n\n\"Not as beautiful as you are to me,\" he said, kissing away the\ncreases on her forehead. \"Greta. I live here, and I make love to\nyou. Ms. Maupin, who, as you are now aware, is your husband's\nlover, lives in San Francisco. How many times, Greta, has he told\nyou he's working late at the office? Do you ever check on him\nwhen he goes away? Are you so certain he isn't just fifty miles\nfrom home and at her place, not where he says he's going.\" He\ntouched his finger to her chin. \"Need I go on?\"\n\nShe met his eyes. \"No,\" she said quietly, and he kissed her.\nWell, Matthew, she thought, tit for tat, and told herself to let\nit go. Then she remembered how this whole crazy afternoon had\nstarted.\n\nShe held up the receipt.\n\n\"When do I start packing?\" she said and gave the form a little\nshake.\n\nHe took it and opened it and smiled and wrapped his arms around\nher waist and kissed her chest and lifted her off the ground.\n\"We're going home!\" he hooted.\n\nThen he grimaced and made a pained sound and nearly dropped her.\n\n\"Darling! What is it? Your shoulder?\"\n\nHe nodded, closed his eyes to fight off the pain.\n\n\"Oh, you poor thing. When we go we've got to get that fixed for\nyou, first thing. I don't care what it costs.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"It's very expensive,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't care. Now I want you to promise me you'll let me do that\nfor you. Promise?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I promise.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Greta said, and began unbuttoning her blouse.\n\n\nChapter 20\n\n\nAfter bolting from the boardroom, Matthew called William\nHarrell's secretary at ICP in New York, and she confirmed what he\nalready knew: William was out of town, and was due back into New\nYork this evening. He asked her for the flight number and\ndeparture time from San Francisco, then took off for the airport.\n\nHe raced down the corridor of the United terminal, checked his\nwatch as he slowed to pass through the metal detectors. He found\nWilliam's flight on one of the departure screens, and to his\ngreat relief, the flight had been delayed fifteen minutes. He\ncollected himself and walked quickly to the correct gate.\n\nHe spotted William in the gate waiting area, flipping through\nsome notes, a leather garment bag beside him on the floor.\n\nMatthew walked up to him, and William glanced up from his\nnotebook. \"Matthew,\" he said, surprised. He snapped his notebook\nclosed and stood, shook Matthew's extended hand with a mixture of\ncuriosity and indifference. \"Are you on this flight?\"\n\n\"No. I need to talk to you,\" Matthew said. He motioned for\nWilliam to sit, then sat down beside him.\n\n\"I know you met with Peter Jones today,\" Matthew said, glancing\nat the binder in William's lap.\n\n\"I did,\" William said.\n\nMatthew hadn't expected William to deny that he had met with\nPeter, though now, hearing him admit it, he feared that they had\nalready formed some sort of deal, and that he was possibly too\nlate.\n\n\"Look, I'll get right to the point. Today I proposed to the\nexecutive staff that I contact you with Wallaby's proposition of\nmerging our two companies, as you originally planned.\"\n\n\"Really. And why, may I ask, the sudden change of heart?\"\n\nMatthew cleared his throat and tried for an open confiding tone.\n\"Simple. We decided that a merger would be the best thing for\nWallaby because of how well the strategic alliance was received,\nand how well the Joey II is selling already. The orders are\nphenomenal.\"\n\nThe gate attendant announced that flight was about to begin\nboarding. Matthew's heart quickened, but William's expression\nremained cool and unchanged.\n\n\"The best thing?\" William repeated, barely able to conceal his\nsarcasm. \"I see.\"\n\n\"I want us to go through with the rest of our plan,\" Matthew\nsaid. \"With my support, the merger would be smooth and friendly.\nI guarantee it.\"\n\n\"And the board of directors?\"\n\n\"I've already put a call in to each, and have spoken with two\nmembers on my way here. Both approved the prospect. And with\ntheir votes, as well as mine and Hank's, we've already got a\nmajority, in addition to the entire executive staff's full\nsupport.\"\n\n\"Hmm. Interesting. Let me think about this, Matthew.\" William\nrose to his feet and reached for his garment bag.\n\n\"Wait,\" Matthew said, gripping the other man's arm desperately.\n\"I know the original plan wavered a little, but I fully\nunderstand now that you were right all along.\" Matthew had to get\nWilliam's assurance, his word, that they would go back to their\noriginal plan.\n\nHoisting his garment bag over his shoulder, William seemed\nnonplused. The gate attendant announced final boarding.\n\n\"I know it's asking a lot,\" Matthew said, stepping between\nWilliam and his path to the gate. \"But I'd like your word that\nyou'll recommend to your board that ICP reinstate its plan to\nacquire Wallaby.\"\n\nWilliam glanced down at the notebook tucked under his arm.\nMatthew fancied that he was perhaps sizing up the second of two\nopportunities that had been presented to him today, silently\njudging which of the two rivals he would choose.\n\nWilliam looked Matthew in the eye, nodded. \"Very well,\" he said,\n\"I'll make the recommendation, as we had originally planned.\nYou've got my word.\"\n\nMatthew let out a sound that was at once a great sigh of relief\nand a slightly hysterical chuckle. \"Thank you,\" Matthew said,\nslapping William on the back. \"Thank you, thank you.\" He ambled\nalongside William to the gate and quickly ran down his immediate\ncourse of action.\n\n\"Matthew, relax,\" William said. \"I said you have my word. Now, go\nhome. We'll talk in the morning.\" William handed the flight\nattendant his boarding pass, and she removed the ticket and\nhanded him the receipt stub.\n\n\"Good-bye, Matthew,\" William said, then turned and proceeded down\nthe jetway.\n\nIt was done.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nPeter picked up the phone to call Kate at her studio, but then he\nremembered the message Grace had given him. He dialed the number.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Phillips and Phillips,\" a receptionist\nannounced.\n\n\"Arnold Phillips, please,\" Peter said.\n\nThe man came on the line a moment later.\n\n\"This is Peter Jones. You called me?\"\n\n\"Mr. Jones, thank you for returning my call so promptly. I'm\nrepresenting Ms. Ivy Green. She has hired our firm to reclaim her\nrights to Isle, which I believe is currently in your possession.\"\n\nThe room spun. Peter dropped down onto the sofa. \"Wait a minute.\nI thought she was still in detox? She's not fit to be a mother.\nNot yet.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Jones, no, no. There seems to be a misunderstanding. I\napologize for not making the purpose of my call clear from the\nstart. My client has not retained me to reclaim her child. It's\nthe hardware and software I'm referring to. However, I believe my\npartner does in fact need to talk to you also, about another\ncase.\"\n\nPeter listened to what Mr. Phillips had to say, then, a half hour\nlater, he was transferred to another Mr. Phillips, who, for\nforty-five minutes, discussed the child-custody case he had been\nhired by Ivy to handle. A hell of a one-two punch.\n\nBy the time he hung up the phone he was numb all over. In just\nover an hour, his whole life, which he had managed to somehow get\nback on track, however shakily, had once again come undone. He\nfelt like he was at the end of his rope, like he was cracking up.\nAnd the only person who could ever help him through the really\ntough times was Kate. That was who he needed to talk to right\nnow.\n\nBut how? How could he call her, when the reason he needed her was\nthe very reason she had left him?\n\nSo instead of calling her he sat there alone, wondering if this\nwas it, if this was the last of his punishment for his mistakes,\nor was there still more to undo?\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Matthew said, finding Greta in the den,\ncrouched among a scattering of cardboard boxes.\n\n \"What does it look like I'm doing?\"\n\n\"Packing.\"\n\n\"Bingo.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Why?\" she repeated, taking in his goofy expression. \"Why do\npeople usually pack, Matthew? Because I'm moving.\" She returned\nto her task of carefully settling a vase into a box.\n\nHe placed his hands on the box flaps, holding them down as she\nstretched a length of tape from a spool. \"When?\"\n\n\"Soon. And I can do this, thank you,\" she said curtly, holding\nthe strip of tape over the box. He let go and dropped his hands\nto his sides.\n\n\"Greta, I'm sorry about today,\" he said, watching her work. \"It's\nnot what you think, though.\"\n\nShe stopped what she was doing for a moment and shot him a\nwarning look. He had come to understand that look very well in\nthe last few months. She went back to her business, placing the\nbox atop a few others.\n\nHe shifted on his feet and then all at once his face brightened.\n\"Hey, guess what! We're back to our original plan!\"\n\nShe settled an antique serving dish inside a new box. \"Good for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Didn't you hear me?\"\n\nShe poured foam puffs into the box.\n\n\"Greta?\" he said, gripping her wrists.\n\n\"Get your hands off me,\" she said calmly, wriggling from his\ngrasp. The box between them trembled dangerously. She quickly\nrighted it.\n\n\"Greta, please,\" he said. \"What you saw today was just lunch.\"\n\n\"Horseshit,\" she said, getting worked up. Then she checked\nherself. She had no intention of getting into an argument with\nhim after the shit she had been through today. \"Matthew, listen\nto me. I'm only going to spell this out once. I gave you the time\nyou asked for. Now you've pushed me too far. Besides, it doesn't\nmatter.\"\n\n\"It does,\" he insisted. \"What I'm saying is, it's all over. ICP's\ngoing to buy Wallaby after all. And I'll become president of the\nsubsidiary, just like we planned. And we can go back to New York\nif that's what you want. Or we can stay here. Or whatever.\nWhatever you want.\"\n\n\"Ah, of course. You'll need a wife if you're going to be a big\nshot at ICP. Might as well stick with the one you've got, save\nyourself some money that way, and keep the young thing in an\napartment.\" She offered a scornful chuckle. \"Christ, Matthew. You\nstill don't want to face it?\" She shook her head sadly. \"It's too\nlate. We're through. Broken.\"\n\n\"But it's going to be easy from here on in,\" he pleaded, trailing\nher to a black lacquer display pedestal. \"My job at ICP will be a\ncake walk.\"\n\n\"Cake? Darling, the only cake walk I see is the one between you\nand your little girlfriend.\" Enough of this nonsense. She had\nwork to do. She wanted to have her most prized possessions safely\npacked, to give her a sense of assurance that she was getting\ncloser to her future with her lover.\n\nGingerly, she raised her crystal salmon bowl off its pedestal.\n\n\"Greta,\" Matthew cried, gripping the bowl.\n\nShe gasped in surprise, then shrieked, \"What's gotten into you -\nlet go!\" The quartz ceiling lamp accentuated the bowl's\nprecarious plight.\n\n\"Wait. Oh, Greta. Don't you remember the day you brought this\nhome?\" he said.\n\nHer eyes fixed on his thumbs squashed white, firm and unyielding.\nThe piece was too valuable to risk losing. She gave in, and he\ncarefully settled it back onto the pedestal. She stared at him\nwith a resigned frown, catching her breath. He had nearly ruined\nit.\n\nMatthew bent over, set his hands on his knees. \"Look at it,\" he\nsaid, mesmerized by the engraved salmon fish swimming their\nfinal, predestined course.\n\n\"All right, Matthew, you've your look. Enough now. Please\" She\nreached for the bowl.\n\nHe gripped too. \"It's over,\" he said, his voice cracking. \"Don't\nyou understand? The struggle's over, Greta. Do you remember when\nyou came home with this bowl, to celebrate our plans coming\ntogether? That was when it started. And now it's over. So you\nsee? It all worked out. Everything is fine now. Fine.\"\n\nShe glared at him. \"Let go of my bowl.\"\n\n\"Greta, please. It means so much to me. To us,\" he urged, tugging\nforcefully.\n\n\"No, damn you. It's mine and I'm taking it with me.\"\n\n\"Where?\" he shouted at the top of his lungs. \"Just where the hell\ndo you think you're going?\" His neck was straining, and his\nknuckles were white around the bowl's rim.\n\n\"To France!\" she cried. Her eyes glistened in the bright white\nlight. \"With Jean-Pierre.\"\n\nHe burst with laughter, and shot his face closer to hers, over\nthe bowl. \"The horse trainer? Oh, that's good, Greta. That's real\ngood! The horse trainer! So I'm not the only one sleeping with\nthe staff, am I?\"\n\nHer fingers hurt, and she could barely hold on any longer.\n\n\"Matthew, please,\" she begged, afraid. She was painfully close to\nletting go, and with this awareness came another, deeper\nunderstanding. That were it not for her missing finger, she would\nhave possessed the strength to hold on tighter and harder and\nlonger -  No, that was not it, she realized with a cry, her\nunderstanding now complete. The truth was, was were it not for\nher missing finger, none of this would have ever happened. Tears\nstreamed down her face and she begged him to please let her have\nher bowl.\n\n\"Oh Greta,\" Matthew said with disgust, \"you're so pathetic.\"\n\nHe released his grip on the bowl...and the misfortune that\ndirectly followed his letting go lasted only seconds.\n\nWith great force the bowl crashed into Greta's chest and\npropelled her backward.\n\nInstantly seeing what his letting go would cause, Matthew dove\nforward with outstretched hands. His fingers grazed the bowl's\nsurface.\n\nFlying backward, Greta let go of the bowl and thrust her hands\nbehind her to try and break her fall. However, it was her not her\nbottom that crashed first, but her head, into the wall behind\nher.\n\nHer body dropped to the floor in a lifeless heap, legs splayed at\nan awkward angle.\n\nMatthew, in midair, felt the bowl's cool underside brush his\nfingertips and he squeezed his hands together. But it was too\nlate.\n\nThe base of the object struck the hardwood floor. It shattered\nwith a resonant ring, and shards of glass blasted in every\ndirection.\n\nHe closed his eyes as he sailed to the ground and landed in a\npile of glass between his wife's unmoving legs.\n\nThen, perfect silence.\n\nHe lay there for a moment before opening his eyes, grateful at\nonce that his vision had escaped the shrapnel. The first thing he\nsaw was blood. He panicked, and glass crunched beneath his arms\nas he raised himself up on his elbows. He was aware of many stabs\nalong the undersides of his arms and blood started gushing from\nhis palms.\n\nThen he saw her. He quickly brushed the largest broken pieces\naway with a folded box. He leaned close to her face, squeezed her\ncheeks between his bloody fingers. \"Greta,\" he shouted. \"Wake\nup!\" He looked from her face to her chest for evidence of life,\npressed her stomach, tried to make her breathe. He squeezed her\nlips between her fingers and put his lips on hers and blew, felt\nnothing in return. Had he killed her? He let out an agonized\ngroan, how could this be happening when everything was back to\nthe way they had planned?\n\nHe crawled up between her legs. He pulled her head to his chest,\nand with his other hand he searched for her pulse.\n\n\"Oh Greta,\" he moaned, gazing with disbelief at the fragments.\n\nWhere was her pulse?\n\n\"I'll fix it,\" he whispered, probing for her heartbeat with his\nbloody fingertips, all the while staring with bedazzled eyes at\nthe brilliant shards twinkling in the light, searching in vain\nfor one that might contain the etchings of the salmon fish.\n\nBut he found none, for their arduous journey had come to its\nfated end, lost forever in the frozen crystal bits.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nOnce the plane reached cruising altitude, William reclined his\nseat and closed his eyes, musing over an idea that had flashed in\nhis mind the instant Matthew had asked for his promise.\n\nNow, after dozing on and off through half the flight,\nhalf-consciously dreaming up the specifics of his new plan, he\nwas ready to put down the particulars. He opened his notebook on\nthe tray table and went to work. He drew various boxes and\nconnected them together. He penciled his name in the uppermost\nbox, and filled in the others.\n\nA flight attendant appeared at his seat. \"Sir, you slept through\nthe meal. Can I bring you a snack or a beverage?\"\n\nHe looked up from the chart. This was cause for celebration.\n\n\"How about a Sassy Screw?\" he said, a little embarrassed saying\nthe cocktail's name, but in want of one just the same. He\ncontinued drawing, completely filling the page with little\nsquares and lines.\n\nThe flight attendant returned and placed the drink on a napkin\nbeside his notebook. As he put the finishing touches on his work,\na few bubbles fizzed from his drink and settled on the page,\nstaining it with tiny dots.\n\nAs he stared at the little dots speckling his work, an awfully\nfunny thought entered his mind. A short laugh burst from his\nlips, and a few passengers in nearby seats glanced curiously his\nway.\n\nThere, on the page, was the cause for William's amusement. The\nlittle orange dots, speckling the paper. Matthew's one-time soda\npop success, now a mere stain on William's organization chart.\n\nPop, pop, fizzle, he mused, and sipped his cocktail.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nPeter stood beneath Hoover Tower on the Stanford Campus, not far\nfrom the very place where he had first met Ivy. He had agreed to\nmeet her here, to discuss the terms of her cases against him.\n\nIn the time he had to wait for her, he considered his life as it\nwas at this moment. He had long ago gotten over the hurt and\nanger he had felt from being ousted from Wallaby. He missed Kate,\nbut the work he was doing with Byron went a long way to keeping\nhis mind off his loss of her. Not all the way, but enough to\nhelp. Isle was healthy, and Ivy's lawyers had said that she was\ndeemed stable enough to mother her baby. But it was his baby,\ntoo. And had he not felt something for her, that night they were\ntogether? To be honest, he was not sure. That night was long past\nnow, lost in mixed up events and complicated circumstances. All\nthat remained of it was the unusual feeling he still carried in\nhis heart, about everything that had been affected by his actions\nthat evening. He knew he was not in love with Ivy. But he loved\nhis baby, their baby, and the three of them formed a kind of\nfamily, didn't they? He had never been part of a real family, and\nthe thought of his daughter going through life without two\nparents deeply disturbed him. Would Ivy consider marriage?\n\n\"No lawyers?\"\n\nHe spun around...and was stunned by her transformation.\n\nShe looked as youthful and vibrant as when they had first met.\nHer bright white-blond hair was pulled up into a smart bun, and\nher delicate face was tanned. Her blue eyes sparkled with the\niridescence of tropical water.\n\nHe wanted to touch her, her belly, the place where Isle had come\nfrom. She smiled, and he experienced a stirring for her that was\nunlike any he had felt before, a connection of some kind, between\nher and himself and their child. It was all light and strangely\nuplifting, and he let out a breath and wet his lips and formed in\nhis head the words he would say to her, for at this instant he\nknew, yes, that he could love her and that they belonged\ntogether. That they were a family.\n\nBut her smile was changing, right before his eyes. It became a\nsmile that betrayed not her happiness to see him, but her\nhappiness to see him looking at her this way. Looking at her with\nreal attraction. Desire. Her smile was the smile of pure\nself-satisfaction.\n\n\"Amazing, isn't it,\" she said. \"What a little time can do?\"\n\n\"Oh, Ivy,\" he said, turning his hands helplessly. \"I'm sorry.\nAbout all of it.\"\n\n\"Ha,\" she said. \"Please. I've been in the desert learning how to\nstop apologizing. Take my advice, save it.\"\n\n\"But we don't have to be like this. Can't we try to be, I don't\nknow, nice?\"\n\n\"Um, no. Not now, anyway. This is business, Peter. Maybe in a\nwhile, after we close our agreement.\"\n\n\"But I don't want you to be angry forever.\"\n\n\"Sit down,\" she said, and he did. She remained standing however,\nlooking down at him. \"Poor Peter. Just a lost little boy. Look,\nI'm not pissed off anymore. Well, not too angry. I'm not sorry,\neither. What's done is done. I am definitely not having an easy\ntime of it, coming off the drugs and all. But I will get there.\nAll I want is to see my Isle, and my Isle, and how they've grown\nin your care.\" She seated herself on the concrete beside him. \"I\nthought for sure you'd have ten lawyers here with you,\" she said.\n\n\"Nope,\" he said. \"Where are yours?\"\n\n\"Don't need them for this. They told you what I want.\" She\nwithdrew a single folded sheet document from inside her light\njacket. \"It's all here. Plain and simple.\"\n\nHe accepted her pen and the contract, spread the page down on the\nconcrete.\n\nBut he didn't sign it.\n\nInstead he put the pen down, looked her in the eye. \"What do you\nfeel?\"\n\n\"Feel? About this? Excellent.\"\n\n\"No. I mean about me.\"\n\n\"You?\" She looked away for a second. He could see her expression\nsoften. \"I'm not sure.\" She met his eyes. \"But it's not anger\nanymore. Really it isn't.\"\n\n\"No, I don't mean that.\"\n\n\"Guilt? Nah, I'm done with that.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"No, not that.\" He looked at her forehead.\nUnwrinkled and smooth, pure. Eyes so sharp, intense, curious.\nCautious. He remembered what it had been like to touch her neck,\nher breasts. Back to her eyes.\n\n\"Is there anything else?\" he said. \"I don't know. I mean - love?\"\n\nShe blinked her eyes closed for a few moments, and when she\nopened them again they were glistening. But from what emotion he\ncould not tell.\n\n\"Peter, just sign it.\"\n\n\n\nPART V\n\n\nChapter 21\n\n\nHe had not slept all night.\n\nIt was not because he missed sleeping in the same bed with Greta.\nThat, of course, had ended. Nor was it because he missed sleeping\nwith Laurence. At almost exactly the same time Wallaby started\nits merger negotiations with ICP, Laurence had taken a temporary\nleave of absence to, she said, care for her ill father. It was\njust as well, considering what had happened to Greta and\neverything that had followed. Besides, the majority of his\nspeaking engagements had been postponed or canceled, and he spent\nhis time attending meeting after meeting, and putting together\npiece of the business plan, which consumed most of his waking and\nsleeping hours. Relentlessly, he studied ICP's complex corporate\nstructure and product line. Once more his favorite bed partner\nwas paperwork - binders, reports, analyses, and technical\ndocuments, a courtship that all led up to today.\n\nToday. The reason he had not been able to sleep all night. He\nclimbed out of the bed and strolled leisurely through the dark\nhouse, crossing through the living room. A few months ago, after\nGreta's accident, he had moved the sofa and furniture against the\nwall, among the many stacked boxes that occupied the room.\n\nToday was the most important day of his life. After more than\nthree long and arduous years of cultivation, he was about to\nharvest his greatest achievement. The merger of ICP and Wallaby.\nFinally his monumental plan would reach its climax. And afterward\nhe would begin his new plan -  But not so fast, he warned\nhimself. One step at a time.\n\nThe emerging dawn lit up the kitchen with a dull gray. He opened\nthe refrigerator, considered making breakfast, then decided\nagainst it. He had no appetite. Instead he poured himself a glass\nof milk and gazed out the kitchen window while he sipped,\npondering his new and exciting future.\n\nHis presence would be required in both New York and California.\nMaybe he would set up his primary residence in New York, and find\nsomething smaller in California, perhaps even in San Francisco.\nSuch a commute would be trivial, for with ICP's takeover, the\nissue of highway miles would disappear and he would do his work\non his rides between office and residence in the chauffeured\nlimousine he would be entitled to.\n\nA rush of elation coursed through him, and he decided to go for a\nrun. Besides, it was too early to leave, and a run would pass the\ntime until he had to get ready and meet William Harrell at the\nannouncement.\n\nHe placed his glass in the sink and left the kitchen, changed\ninto sweats. He needed to be at the hall by nine o'clock. He tied\nhis sneaker and stretched through a few warm-up exercises, then\ncollected his house keys.\n\nJust as he was about to leave, the telephone rang.\n\nHe checked his jogging watch and picked up the handset. It was\nWilliam Harrell. They exchanged greetings, and William asked\nMatthew if they could meet for breakfast before the announcement.\n\n\"I was just going to go out for a run, but sure.\"\n\n\"Go for your run,\" William told him. \"I'll meet you at the Good\nEarth restaurant at seven-fifteen.\"\n\n\"Will do,\" Matthew said, and asked William what was so pressing\nthat they needed to meet before the event.\n\nBut William had already hung up, leaving Matthew do presume that\nhis business partner probably wanted to go over a few last-minute\ndetails before the big show.\n\nAlthough he had no way of knowing it, he had presumed correctly.\nThere was indeed one minor detail left to go over.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nWhen she heard him leave the second time, after his run, Greta\nclimbed out of bed.\n\nShe too had not slept very well. She was too excited. She\nstretched and considered climbing onto her exercise cycle for a\nquick workout. Checking the clock however, she decided to skip\nit. She would rather use whatever spare time she had to make sure\nshe had not forgotten to pack anything that the shipping company\nwould later send to France.\n\nStanding at the window, she gazed out at the dawning day. Across\nthe lake she could see Jean-Pierre's cottage. The lights were\noff. She pictured him in her mind, sleeping peacefully. No more\nwould she sleep alone, she thought to herself, letting go of the\ncurtain.\n\nShe took eggs and ham from the refrigerator and set to making\nherself breakfast. Marie didn't usually arrive until eight\no'clock, and besides, she thought dreamily as she cracked the\neggs into a bowl, it was good practice for the big country\nbreakfasts she would make for Jean-Pierre and herself.\n\nWhile she prepared her eggs, the pictures he had shown her when\nhe returned from France last week flashed through her mind. It\nhad taken him a while, but he had finally found them the ranch of\nher dreams. How she had missed him! It had been a long and\npainful two months, she reflected, but today would finally signal\nthe end of her suffering with Matthew.\n\nAfter what he had done to her, nearly killing her that day they\nhad fought over her bowl, he ended his resistance to her request\nfor a divorce. On the contrary, because of what he had done, her\ncase against him was even stronger, and he had no choice but to\nagree to her lawyer's terms. The final papers would be drawn up\nany day.\n\nShe seated herself at the breakfast table. While she ate she\nchecked the list she had been keeping. Everything she wanted\nshipped was checked on the list. Her clothes were already packed,\nand their plane tickets were the only unchecked item on the list.\nJean-Pierre had taken care of them. Still, she would ask him to\nshow her the tickets when she arrived at his cottage in the\nlimousine. Just to be safe.\n\nShe looked at the clock again and saw that it was a good thing\nshe had gotten out of bed early. Somehow she had managed to spend\nnearly a half hour sitting just there dawdling, daydreaming. The\ncar was due to arrive at eight o'clock sharp, and now she would\nhave to hurry.\n\nShe left her dirty dishes for the housekeeper and trotted briskly\nto her room, noticing outside the clouds darkening the sky. It\nhad rained all week but last night's weather report for today had\npromised a possible break in the showers. She prayed they\nwouldn't have to take off under stormy conditions, for it would\nbe a miserable way to start off on their new life together.\n\n\nChapter 22\n\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, please find your seats,\" the announcer's\nvoice boomed through the bustling auditorium.\n\nThe seating was already jammed to nearly full capacity as\nthousands of Wallaby employees filled the auditorium. A few front\nrows remained vacant, reserved for VIPs and the press. The stage\nwas illuminated with a bright circle of light focused on an empty\npodium.\n\nBackstage, William Harrell parted the curtain an inch and peered\nout at the gabby crowd. Hank Towers squeezed in beside him and\nalso surveyed the crowd.\n\n\"I've never given a speech to so many people dressed like that,\"\nWilliam remarked.\n\nBeyond the first few dark rows, wave after wave of bodies clad in\nT-shirts and jeans stretched all the way to the back of the\nauditorium.\n\nWilliam stepped away from the curtain and rearranged his tie.\n\nHank patted him on the shoulder and laughed. \"You look like\nyou've gained twenty pounds,\" he joked privately.\n\n\"They're going to witness the world's fastest weight-loss\nprogram,\" William said with a cunning grin, referring to the\nsurprise he had prepared for today's announcement.\n\n\"Get ready, William,\" Martin Cohn said, gesturing for everyone to\nmove away from the curtains.\n\nThe announcer's voice filled the auditorium: \"Ladies and\ngentlemen, vice president and general counsel, Martin Cohn.\"\n\nAmid quick applause and murmurs, Martin greeted the audience. The\nWallaby logo appeared, projected brightly behind him on a huge\nscreen hanging above center stage.\n\n\"This day will mark an important juncture in Wallaby's history,\"\nMartin said. \"A few months ago we announced a strategic alliance\nwith International Computer Products, the world's largest\nmanufacturer of computer products.\"\n\nThe ICP initials materialized beside the Wallaby logo.\n\n\"As a result of our announcement, sales of the Joey II computer\nhave skyrocketed, exceeding in just two months the previous\nyear's total sales.\"\n\nThe audience applauded, and the screen changed to a picture of\nthe Joey II sitting beside an ICP desktop computer.\n\n\"Today we have an announcement that will ensure that both Wallaby\nand ICP continue to grow and profit together.\"\n\nThere was a dead silence, and a photo of William Harrell's\nsmiling face filled the overhead screen. \"Now it's my pleasure to\nintroduce William Harrell, chairman of International Computer\nProducts.\"\n\nA murmur ensued throughout the audience. Though Martin Cohn\nusually started off the meetings, it was always to introduce\nMatthew Locke.\n\nMartin stepped aside, and William crossed the stage. The audience\napplauded mildly and stopped once William arrived at the podium.\n\n\"Thank you, Martin. And thank you,\" William said, sweeping the\naudience with a heartfelt smile. \"I've always been envious of you\nguys out here in California. I look out there and all I see are\nT-shirts, jeans, and sneakers.\"\n\nThere was some mild laughter, and William knew the crowd was\nprobably a little thrown off by his being up here and not Matthew\nLocke. He went right into his presentation.\n\n\"Maybe it's this kind of environment in which you work at Wallaby\nthat lets you create products as spectacular as the Joey\ncomputer.\"\n\nOn the screen an older picture of the original Joey team\nappeared, a younger Peter Jones kneeling in the center of the\ngroup, his arms wrapped around a Joey poised on his knee. The\naudience applauded with pride and appreciation.\n\n\"A few months ago, your company and ICP joined forces to work\ntogether to offer our customers powerful hybrid systems. On that\nday a dream came true for me. Finally, users of ICP's line of\ncomputers had an easy way to access our difficult operating\nsystems, actually working smarter because of the Joey. Now,\nthat's a big deal to us starched shirts at ICP,\" he confided,\n\"because we've been playing catch-up with Wallaby, trying to\nfigure out how to build portable computers and personal\ninformation assistant software as great as the Joey.\n\n\"You see, the truth is is I've always been envious of the Joey\nand Wallaby. Jealous that we, the biggies, hadn't been the one to\ninvent an equally breakthrough design.\"\n\nIt was time for him to pull his prank, which he hoped would act\nas the perfect segue to the real announcement. Pulling off his\ntie, he stepped away from the podium and strolled to center\nstage.\n\nA strip-tease song started playing on the big speakers throughout\nthe auditorium, and the audience was mute with wonder as William\nbegan unbuttoning his shirt. Next he unzipped his pants, and\ndropped them to the floor. Underneath, he wore faded jeans. He\npulled off his shirt and flung it aside. He raised his arms, and\nturned around so the audience could see the graphic on his back.\nIt showed the joey kangaroo as always, but this time the pocket\nit climbed out of was embroidered with the ICP logo.\n\nThe audience applauded and cheered as he sauntered back to the\npodium.\n\n\"Oh, wait a minute, I forgot something,\" he said, then crouched\nbehind the podium. A moment later his black wingtip shoes clunked\nhollowly out onto the stage, and he produced a pair of worn-out\nsneakers. Encouraged by cheers and laughter, he fumbled comically\nwith the running shoes and laced them up.\n\n\"Now, dressed like this, you'd think I could probably do some of\nthe thinking you guys do to make amazing computers, right?\"\n\n\"Right!\" the audience echoed, playing along with his skit.\n\n\"Wrong,\" he said. \"To have the systems you folks have, guys like\nme have to leave it to you, the experts.\"\n\nHere goes. He felt his heart pounding wildly, and he took a deep\nbreath.\n\n\"What I'm about to announce may at first come as a shock to you,\"\nhe warned, serious now, \"but please,\" he said emphasizing with\nhis hands, \"before you throw your chairs, give me a moment to\nexplain.\"\n\nAs he had feared, an anxious murmur started up in the crowd. He\nhad to act fast.\n\n\"Today,\" he said, raising his voice, \"I'm very excited and proud\nto announce the merger of Wallaby and International Computer\nProducts.\n\nMayhem exploded throughout the audience.\n\n\"Wait, please!\" William shouted with raised palms, his voice\nbarely audible in the angry cacophony. \"Wait. Please, let me\nexplain...\" he said, moving across the stage, closer to the\nincensed crowd.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThe limousine driver collected Greta's Louis Vuitton suitcases\nand boxes and bags and carried them to the car. He set them at\nthe rear for a moment then ran to open her door. She jumped in\nand wiped the light drizzle from her face with a scarf.\n\nThe trunk slammed shut and the driver climbed in and started the\ncar. As they drove through the gate she looked over her shoulder\nat the house. She thought of her house keys, which she had left\nbehind on the breakfast table. She would never need them again.\nIt was really ending. With her things packed and ready to be\nshipped to France, there was no reason to ever come back. She\nchased away any leftover sentiments, and thought only of\nJean-Pierre and their new ranch, their new lives.\n\nGlancing out the window as they turned from the driveway onto the\nroad, she spotted Matthew's approaching car. What was he doing\nback so soon? She turned her head away from the window and shut\nher eyes. She did not want his face to be her last memory of her\nlife in California.\n\nThe driver switched on the radio, just as a news brief was being\nannounced. \"...and in Silicon Valley this morning, in a coup that\nhas stunned the business world, International Computer Products,\nthe world's largest computer company, and Wallaby Computer, have\nannounced the merger of their two companies, as well as - \"\n\n\"Shut it off!\" Greta snapped, pressing her hands to her ears.\n\"Please!\"\n\nThe looked at her in the rearview mirror and apologized. A minute\nlater they were bouncing along the ranch's bumpy dirt driveway,\nand she directed the driver past the main house, to the cottages.\nShe smoothed her lavender Chanel dress over her legs and touched\nthe lapel of her Gucci raincoat.\n\nHer heart stopped for an instant. Jean-Pierre's car was gone.\n\nOf course, she rationalized, scolding herself for being so\nanxious. He's probably arranged to have it shipped back to\nFrance. Or did he say he was going to sell it? She couldn't\nremember.\n\nThe driver stopped the car.\n\n\"We'll only be a minute,\" Greta said, pulling on her gloves as\nshe climbed out before the driver could reach her door. Ducking\nin the light drizzle, she shrouded her scarf over her head and\nwent up the steps to his front door. She rang the bell, then\nglanced back to the limousine for a moment.\n\nSilence.\n\nShe pressed the bell again, once, twice, and at the same time\nscanned the barn and the training ring for any sign of him. The\nstable doors were shut. Could he have overslept? She checked her\nwatch then pounded the door, growing more worried with each\nmoment that passed without his answering the door. She had\nplanned for them to get to the airport early, and even if he was\nasleep they could still certainly make their flight as long as\nthey hurried.\n\nShe turned and raised her hand at the driver, signaling for him\nto wait. She hurried off the small porch and ran around to the\nback of the house. She looked into his bedroom window. The bed\nwas made, and rising on her toes, she could see through the\nbedroom door into the living room. He wasn't inside.\n\nShe climbed the small rear steps and frantically pounded her fist\nagainst the door, oblivious to the pain she was causing herself.\n\n\"Jean-Pierre!\" she called. \"Open up! Jean-Pierre!\"\n\nShe held her breath and listened.\n\nMore of nothing.\n\nShe felt a chilling wave of nausea and told herself not to panic,\nthat he was around here somewhere and tending to some last-minute\nthings.\n\nRounding the house, she wagged her finger at the driver again and\nbolted for the barn, her raincoat whipping in the wind.\n\nMaybe he was at Jennifer's house, she considered, saying good-bye\nto his former employer. She would check that after she searched\nthe stable. Or was he with Mighty Boy? Yes, that was probably it.\nHe was probably saying good-bye to Mighty Boy for her, so kind of\nhim, because he knew that she could not face saying good-bye\nherself because they were unable to transfer the animal to their\nranch.\n\nShe heaved the stable door open with a grunt and raced down the\ncenter of the long and dark dirt throughway, shouting out\nJean-Pierre's name. As she neared the end, Mighty Boy whinnied.\nShe pushed the horse's head to one side and went inside the\nstall, encountering only the animal. Did she really think he\nwould be in here with her horse? No, he had to be outside\nsomewhere. Her stomach tightened at the thought of missing their\nflight.\n\nShe turned and started to run back up the throughway, when\nsuddenly she stopped dead in her tracks. There!\n\n\"Jean-Pierre,\" she cried, laughing now as she hurled herself\ntoward the shadowy, darkly-clad figure looming just inside the\nstable.\n\nShe froze in her tracks when she realized her error.\n\n\"Oh!\" she moaned.\n\nJennifer, the ranch's owner, pulled back the hood of her raincoat\nand approached her cautiously. A bewildered expression creased\nher face as she took in Greta's disheveled appearance.\n\n\"Mrs. Locke, my goodness,\" she said with a wary smile. \"It's a\nbit wet for a ride today, don't you think?\"\n\n\"Where is he?\" Greta demanded, her chest heaving. \"Where is\nJean-Pierre?\"\n\n\"Jean-Pierre? Why, he's gone.\" Jennifer wiped her brow with the\nback of her hand. \"Oh, it's getting ugly out there,\" she said,\nwincing at the sound of the building downpour rattling down on\nthe metal roof.\n\nGreta grabbed the older woman's raincoat sleeve and roughly spun\nher around, screaming: \"What do you mean he's gone?\"\n\nJennifer leaped back with astonishment. \"He's gone. He left, Mrs.\nLocke. For France.\"\n\n\"No! That's wrong,\" Greta cried. That's not possible, I'm going\nwith him! Do you hear me? He can't be gone!\"\n\nJennifer was mortified and hastily tried to explain. \"Mrs. Locke,\nI gave him a ride to the airport myself. Last night. He informed\nme at the very last moment, yesterday afternoon, that he was\nreturning to France. With her.\"\n\n\"Her? Her who?\"\n\n\"Why, his fiancee, Ms. Maupin.\"\n\nDear God, she thought, suddenly comprehending what Jennifer was\nsaying. He was gone. Gone without her. He had lied to her. Had\ntricked her. It had all been a game. A scam. The girl had\nprobably been in on it all along. A double seduction. And they\nhad gotten away with the money. And with more than the money.\nThey had gotten away with the only happiness she had known in a\nvery long time. It was all coming too quickly, and she felt\nsuddenly faint.\n\nJennifer caught her by the arm just before she collapsed. \"Mrs.\nLocke, come inside with me. You're trembling. I'll make you some\ntea and - \"\n\n\"No!\" Greta cried, shaking free. She stumbled in the dirt,\nlanding on her gloved hands. She unsteadily got to her feet and\nfled from the barn. The driver leaped out of the car and rushed\nto open her door. She had soiled her dress, and her face was\nwild.\n\nShe dove into the back of the car and stumbled to the floor. She\nmanaged to struggle up onto the seat and the driver closed the\ndoor and climbed in up front.\n\n\"Ma'am?\" he called gently through the open partition. She did not\nreply, and he turned around in his seat to look at her.\n\nShe sat huddled with her knees drawn up, elbows pressed into her\nstomach. Her face was hidden behind muddy gloves, and she made\nnoises like she was injured.\n\nHe started the car. \"To the airport, ma'am?\"\n\nShe began rocking back and forth against the door, facing away\nfrom the ranch.\n\n\"Ma'am?\" the driver asked again, braking as he came to the end of\nthe ranch driveway.\n\n\"Home,\" she whispered, and burst into tears.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nWilliam shouted into the microphone again, \"Wait! Please! Listen,\nplease!\"\n\nThe cacophony of protest continued. A pen flew by dangerously\nclose to his head. It was useless. There was no way he could get\nthem to settle down so he could explain the announcement. After\nducking another flying object, William turned and made for the\ncurtains. In just a moment the thing would fix itself.\n\nThe house lights went out and then a spotlight illuminated center\nstage. The curtains parted.\n\nAnd Peter Jones emerged.\n\nThe audience went wild.\n\nPeter took a few steps to the edge of the stage, grinning from\near to ear. The crowd whistled and cheered and rose all at once,\nwelcoming their champion with a standing ovation that lasted and\nlasted, earsplitting in its intensity.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Peter said fanning his hands at the audience. \"And\nthank you, William,\" he said, looking offstage.\n\nThe audience returned to their seats, some still applauding, but\nlow enough so that he could be heard.\n\n\"It's good to be back,\" he said. This lifted the applauding\naudience from their seats once more. He strolled to the podium,\nwiped his forehead with the back of his hand, and waited. When\nthe audience settled down he continued.\n\n\"Today,\" he said, his voice a little shaky, \"I've become ICP's\nnewest employee, in their new subsidiary, Wallaby. I have to\nadmit,\" he said with a laugh, \"it's kind of weird being re-hired\nby the company you started!\"\n\nThere was quick laughter, then rapt attention.\n\n\"When I left Wallaby, I had a lot of time to do some thinking. I\nfound a new friend, and we started working on a new portable\ncomputer, one that stretched our imaginations to the limits.\nThen, a few months ago, we were contacted by William Harrell. He\nhad heard that we were up to something really neat. We decided to\nlet him have a look at what we had come up with, and he loved it.\n\n\"At that point ICP became a silent investor in our computer,\nwhich is called ISLE. We finalized our design and developed a\nprototype. Now I'd like to show you your newest computer.\"\n\nPeter stepped into the middle of the stage. A large, shrouded\ntable rolled before him, controlled remotely from backstage.\n\nThe lights intensified and the tabletop was projected on the\noverhead screen, for all to see.\n\n\"This,\" said Peter, whisking the shroud from the bumpy shapes on\nthe table, \"is ISLE.\" The prototype model was sleek and black, as\nthin as a notebook.\n\nThe audience applauded wildly, then hushed when the computer's\nscreen came to life.\n\n\"Now I'd like to let ISLE show you what she's made of,\" he said.\n\nThe auditorium darkened. Two large projection screens, mirroring\nthe ISLE's screen on stage, lowered from the ceiling. Peter\npicked up the prototype and gave a demonstration like the one he\nhad given to William several months ago. When the demonstration\nwas over the audience stood and cheered with thunderous applause.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Peter said. \"I never thought I'd say this, but I'm\nvery happy about this merger of Wallaby and ICP,\" he said. \"I'll\nbe working in the engineering and development labs, finalizing\nthe ISLE design, and overseeing its integration with the Joey and\nBP systems.\n\n\"Earlier I mentioned a new friend, my partner, the man who helped\ndesign the ISLE computer. Some of you may recognize his name\nbecause he is the father of ICP's first mainframe computer. I've\nalso made two other very important friends. One is the inventor\nof ISLE, and the other is its future.\n\n\"Please give a warm welcome to my friends Byron Holmes and Ivy\nGreen.\" Peter stepped away from the podium, and Byron and a\nbeaming Ivy emerged, cradling the baby Isle in her arms. Peter\nshook Byron's hand and kissed Ivy on the cheek.\n\nByron took the microphone and greeted the audience. A chart\nappeared on the overhead screen, and Byron explained the new\norganization. When he finished, William Harrell returned to the\nstage and conducted the remainder of the session - he also\nannounced Matthew Locke's decision to resign, for personal\nreasons.\n\nBackstage, Byron hugged his wife and Peter and Ivy and Isle all\nin one cluster. \"We did it!\"\n\nIsle yawned.\n\n\"You can say that again,\" Ivy said with a chuckle and kissed her\nbaby on the nose.\n\n\"Come on,\" Peter laughed. \"Let's go home.\"\n\n\nChapter 23\n\n\nThe cyanide pill.\n\nIt was all Matthew could think of as he sat at the breakfast\ntable with his head in his hands. It was over. His work. His\nlove. His life. All gone.\n\nEverything had been going according to plan. Or so he had\nthought.\n\nBut in the final plan, Matthew had not been included. Once more\nhe replayed the scene that had taken place just an hour before.\n\n\nPulling into the Good Earth restaurant's parking lot, Matthew was\nsurprised to see an exact duplicate of his own car. Of course it\ncould be anyone's, but Matthew could not help but think that it\nwas Peter's black BMW coupe parked beside the limousine. What\nwere the chances of Peter happening to be here at the same time?\nOne in a thousand. And Peter Jones was the last person he needed\nto see today. Matthew would simply ask the host to find William's\ntable, and ask him to come outside. They would take their\nbreakfast meeting elsewhere.\n\nHe parked his car at the other end of the lot and walked around\nthe back of the building. He went inside, looking around\ncautiously. At first he had not really noticed the two Wallaby\nsecurity guards standing near the hostess station. Seeing him,\nguards left the station and went into the restaurant.\n\nPositioning himself out of sight of the dining room, he motioned\nfor the hostess\n\n\"I'd like to ask a favor, please,\" he said. \"There's a man I'm\nmeeting here. His name is Mr. Harrell, and he's - \"\n\nJust then William appeared, the two guards flanking him on either\nside.\n\n\"We can't stay here,\" Matthew said. \"Peter Jones is in there\nsomewhere.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know.\"\n\n\"But I'd rather not see him. Today especially. I haven't seen him\nsince he left the company.\"\n\n \"Matthew,\" William said calmly, \"please come inside.\"\n\nBewildered, Matthew followed.\n\n\"William, I'd much rather we go elsewhere,\" he said, then halted\nabruptly when he saw Peter, dressed in an oxford shirt and jeans\nand sitting in one of the booths. Seated beside him was an older\nman wearing dark slacks and a tie.\n\nWilliam pressed him onward, directing him right toward Peter.\n\nPeter looked up, and for the first time since the boardroom\nshowdown, their eyes met. His face bore no surprise, no\nexpression whatsoever.\n\nTo Matthew's astonishment, William led him right up to the booth\nthat Peter occupied. The older man rose and seated himself on the\nother side of the table.\n\n\"Matthew, sit down please,\" William said, indicating the vacant\nseat beside Byron.\n\nMatthew looked at Peter uneasily, but Peter said nothing, he just\nsat there quietly and watched Matthew.\n\nAdding yet another element to Matthew's confusion, Hank Towers\nmaterialized and joined the surprise party. Positively\nastonished, Matthew turned to William for an explanation. \"What's\ngoing on? What the hell is the meaning of all this?\"\n\n\"I'll get right to the point,\" William said. \"Matthew, the\nWallaby board and the executive staff decided to vote on whether\nyou are suited to maintain your position at Wallaby.\"\n\nMatthew struggled to keep his voice down. \"What? This is absurd.\nHow could you do this?\"\n\n\"Matthew, I did it,\" Hank said.\n\nMatthew stared at Hank with disbelieving eyes.\n\n\"I initiated the vote,\" Hank said, \"after several of the\nexecutives and board members came to me with their concerns.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Matthew said breathlessly.\n\n\"Because in your effort to make the company successful, you acted\nwith negligence and selfishness. What's more, you have no\nlong-term strategy for our product line. And in order for us to\nsurvive and continue innovating our company must have a plan.\"\n\nInstantly, Matthew put the pieces together in his mind. He turned\nhis blanched face to Peter and met the dark, unwavering eyes of\nhis nemesis with hateful resignation.\n\n\"So that's it. Now, after I've turned the company around, you\ncome back to run the show?\"\n\nPeter kept quiet.\n\n\"Not exactly,\" William said. \"Byron Holmes here,\" he said,\nindicating the man seated beside Matthew, \"will temporarily take\nover as Wallaby's president.\"\n\nMatthew was deeply shocked.\n\nWilliam said, \"Peter has decided to rejoin Wallaby in an at-large\nposition, working on our future products. However he'll only come\nback if you leave.\" William produced a folded document from his\ncoat pocket. \"I'm sorry, Matthew, but I have to ask you to\nresign.\"\n\n\"I will not,\" Matthew protested loudly.\n\nSeveral diners, most of them Wallaby employees, turned their\nheads in the group's direction.\n\n\"Matthew,\" William said, his voice empathetic now, \"I'm afraid\nyou have no choice.\" He unfolded the document and placed it\nbefore Matthew. \"We've put together a first-rate severance\npackage for you.\"\n\nFor what felt like a long time, Matthew was unable to do anything\nbut sit there and stare down at the document that spelled out the\nrewards of his terrific failure. His brain sizzled as he\nattempted to focus on the details. He saw numbers and lots of\nparenthesized paragraphs. There was a long line at the bottom,\nwith his name printed beneath it.\n\nHe raised his head and looked across the table at Peter. \"Why?\nWhy didn't you just agree with me when I suggested all this? It\nwould have had the same outcome.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Matthew, but it was never that simple.\"\n\n\nBut it could be now, Matthew thought, sitting there at the\nbreakfast table, clutching tightly in his fist the little\ncircular thing he had been hiding in his briefcase for so many\nyears.\n\nHe was completely spent, used up. Alone. There was no one for him\nnow. No one he could call on. William had informed him that\nLaurence had arranged for a transfer to an ICP office in France.\nAnd, effective immediately, Eileen, his former secretary, was\nByron Holmes's personal assistant.\n\nAnd then there was Greta.\n\nHe opened his fist and looked at the gold object in his palm. It\nrolled out of his hand onto the tabletop.\n\nHe twirled Greta's wedding band round and round with his\nfingertip. On that awful day years ago, he had retrieved the ring\nfrom the boat deck before kicking her severed finger into the\nocean. Unable to face the horror of what had happened to her, to\nher hand, he had hidden the ring in his briefcase ever since.\n\nShe was the only person in the world who had ever truly supported\nhim, the only person who would know just what to say right now.\nAnd she was gone. He had destroyed her, too, with his damnable,\nselfish dream. A dream that had become a nightmare. One from\nwhich there would be no waking. It was all over. Really and truly\nthrough.\n\nAh, but the cyanide pill. It was his grandest plan ever. He wiped\nhis nose on his shirtsleeve and straightened, contemplating the\ndetails of his new plan. Had Greta left anything in the medicine\ncabinet? Sleeping pills? What about the garage, in that damned\ncar? He lowered his head to his folded arms again, considered his\noptions.\n\nHe was awakened by the sound of the doorbell.\n\nAs everything came back to him all at once, his first reaction\nwas paranoia. The press. Reporters and photographers. They had\nscaled the gate, and they were coming for him, coming to mock\nhim.\n\n\"Go away,\" he shouted.\n\nBut instead of leaving him alone, they resorted to pounding,\nscreaming his name. They rang again, more pounding.\n\nHe called for Marie and ordered her to send them away. The\nhousekeeper came back a moment later and told him who it was at\nthe door.\n\nHe grabbed the ring and leaped up from his chair, tears finally\ncoming as he staggered down the foyer.\n\nHe twisted the lock and swung open the door.\n\nAnd there she stood. A sobbing Greta, wearing, he noticed at once\nand unmistakably, the very gloves he had bought for Laurence.\nPigskin, and fit for a queen. His queen.\n\nYes, she was wearing them now, and didn't that then mean that he\nhad bought them for her, really? That they belonged together?\n\n\nChapter 24\n\n\nPeter sat on the rug with his legs crossed, Isle in a bundle\nbeside him, and together they listened to Kate's soothing voice\nmingle with the sound of the light rainfall outside.\n\nIvy came into the room, humming softly.\n\n\"Is she asleep?\"\n\n\"Not quite. I think she's sorta wired. She's had a tough day. You\ntoo.\"\n\n\"You three,\" Ivy said.\n\nPeter stood up. \"Thanks for letting her stay here tonight. I'll\nbring her over tomorrow afternoon, if that's okay.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Ivy said. \"A deal's a deal.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nPeter had offered to marry Ivy, but she had declined. In their\nout of court settlement, Peter had agreed to child-support\npayments, and Ivy had granted him visitation rights.\n\nFor the rights to her ISLE hardware and software design, ICP paid\nIvy six million dollars.\n\nThey hugged, and then she was gone.\n\nHe sat back down beside Isle and she stirred. He took her in his\narms.\n\n\"You miss Grandma Gracie and Grandpa Byron already?\" he said,\npretending she understood every word. \"Me too,\" he said.\n\nByron and Grace had left a few hours ago for Maine, to take care\nof some things and plan their move west. They intended to find a\nvacation home in California, where they would reside for however\nlong Byron managed Wallaby.\n\nPeter's own home now felt like it used to, before Isle. Quiet,\nempty. Yet at this moment, it was more full of life than ever.\nBut this, he had to keep reminding himself, was temporary. That\nwas the deal. But it was better than nothing at all. Better than\nbeing completely alone.\n\nThe next song started playing on the disc player. Kate's voice\nchased away the silence, replaced it with the missing element.\n\n\"When you're a little older,\" he told Isle, \"I'm going to teach\nyou how to sing just like that.\"\n\n\"And who's going to teach you?\"\n\nPeter spun around.\n\nKate stood there in the doorway, smiling, wearing a raincoat and\ncarrying a garment bag.\n\n\"I let myself in,\" she said as he jumped to his feet.\n\n\"Hello, babies,\" she said, shrugging off of her wet coat. She\ndropped her bag on the floor and set her purse on the coffee\ntable.\n\n\"I can't believe it's you,\" Peter said excitedly. \"What are you\ndoing here?\"\n\nShe bent, hands on her knees, and smiled brightly at Isle.\n\n\"Look at you, little girl. This is the first time I've seen you\nin person.\" She looked up at Peter. \"Hey, what kind of welcome is\nthat? I thought you'd be happy to see me.\"\n\n\"I am, I am!\" he said touching her arm. \"I just can't believe\nyou're really here.\"\n\n\"Congratulations,\" she said, retrieving a copy of the \"Los\nAngeles Times\" from her purse. \"And to you, too,\" she said waving\nthe front page of the business section at Isle. Beneath the\nheadline was a picture of Peter holding Isle, flanked by Byron\nand Ivy.\n\n\"Back to Wallaby,\" Kate said. \"Sure surprised me.\" She opened her\nhands before Isle. \"May I?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he said, placing Isle gently in Kate's arms. \"Be\ncareful, you have to support her head. Like this,\" he said,\ntaking Kate's hand and carefully cradling it beneath Isle's neck.\n\"That's right.\"\n\nFor a few precious moments he let his hand remain beneath Kate's\nbefore pulling away. Watching her holding the infant Peter felt a\nswell in his throat, wishing it could be like this between them\nagain, always.\n\nKate sat down on the sofa.\n\n\"So, is it true?\"\n\n\"Is what true?\"\n\nFreeing a hand, she picked up the newspaper and scanned the\narticle. \"Here it is,\" she said. \"Quote: 'I'm not going to work\nas much as I used to. There are more important things in my life\nnow.' End quote.\"\n\n\"True,\" he said. \"Totally.\"\n\n\"What about Ivy?\"\n\nHe explained the arrangement they had made and the deal with ICP.\n\n\"Good for her. She's earned it.\"\n\nPeter agreed, then sat quiet for a few moments, unsure how to say\nwhat he wanted to say.\n\n\"What about us? You. I mean, is there any way I can earn you\nback?\"\n\nKate looked at him and smiled. She took his hand and held it in\nher own, beneath Isle.\n\nThey sat there in silence for a while, adjusting to feeling one\nanother again after so long apart. After a minute or so it felt\nto Peter as though they were breathing as one, the way they used\nto, and along with this feeling his heart stirred, declaring\nitself in an unfamiliar way, and he tensed.\n\n\"What is it?\" she said.\n\n\"I'm scared,\" he said.\n\nThey kissed."
