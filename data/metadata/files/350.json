 "text": "FANNY HERSELF\n\nBy Edna Ferber\n\n\nTO WILLIAM ALLEN WHITE\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\nIt has become the fashion among novelists to introduce their hero in\nknee pants, their heroine in pinafore and pigtails. Time was when we\nwere rushed up to a stalwart young man of twenty-four, who was presented\nas the pivot about whom the plot would revolve. Now we are led,\nprotesting, up to a grubby urchin of five and are invited to watch him\nthrough twenty years of intimate minutiae. In extreme cases we have been\nobliged to witness his evolution from swaddling clothes to dresses, from\ndresses to shorts (he is so often English), from shorts to Etons.\n\nThe thrill we get for our pains is when, at twenty-five, he jumps over\nthe traces and marries the young lady we met in her cradle on page two.\nThe process is known as a psychological study. A publisher's note on\npage five hundred and seventy-three assures us that the author is now at\nwork on Volume Two, dealing with the hero's adult life. A third volume\nwill present his pleasing senility. The whole is known as a trilogy.\nIf the chief character is of the other sex we are dragged through her\ndreamy girlhood, or hoydenish. We see her in her graduation white, in\nher bridal finery. By the time she is twenty we know her better than her\nmother ever will, and are infinitely more bored by her.\n\nYet who would exchange one page in the life of the boy, David\nCopperfield, for whole chapters dealing with Trotwood Copperfield, the\nman? Who would relinquish the button-bursting Peggotty for the saintly\nAgnes? And that other David--he of the slingshot; one could not love\nhim so well in his psalm-singing days had one not known him first as the\ngallant, dauntless vanquisher of giants. As for Becky Sharp, with her\ntreachery, her cruelty, her vindicativeness, perhaps we could better\nhave understood and forgiven her had we known her lonely and neglected\nchildhood, with the drunken artist father and her mother, the French\nopera girl.\n\nWith which modest preamble you are asked to be patient with Miss Fanny\nBrandeis, aged thirteen. Not only must you suffer Fanny, but Fanny's\nmother as well, without whom there could be no understanding Fanny. For\nthat matter, we shouldn't wonder if Mrs. Brandeis were to turn out the\nheroine in the end. She is that kind of person.\n\n\n\n\nFANNY HERSELF\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nYou could not have lived a week in Winnebago without being aware of Mrs.\nBrandeis. In a town of ten thousand, where every one was a personality,\nfrom Hen Cody, the drayman, in blue overalls (magically transformed\non Sunday mornings into a suave black-broadcloth usher at the\nCongregational Church), to A. J. Dawes, who owned the waterworks before\nthe city bought it. Mrs. Brandeis was a super-personality. Winnebago\ndid not know it. Winnebago, buying its dolls, and china, and Battenberg\nbraid and tinware and toys of Mrs. Brandeis, of Brandeis' Bazaar,\nrealized vaguely that here was some one different.\n\nWhen you entered the long, cool, narrow store on Elm Street, Mrs.\nBrandeis herself came forward to serve you, unless she already was busy\nwith two customers. There were two clerks--three, if you count Aloysius,\nthe boy--but to Mrs. Brandeis belonged the privilege of docketing you\nfirst. If you happened in during a moment of business lull, you were\nlikely to find her reading in the left-hand corner at the front of the\nstore, near the shelf where were ranged the dolls' heads, the pens, the\npencils, and school supplies.\n\nYou saw a sturdy, well-set-up, alert woman, of the kind that looks\ntaller than she really is; a woman with a long, straight, clever nose\nthat indexed her character, as did everything about her, from her crisp,\nvigorous, abundant hair to the way she came down hard on her heels in\nwalking. She was what might be called a very definite person. But first\nyou remarked her eyes. Will you concede that eyes can be piercing, yet\nvelvety? Their piercingness was a mental quality, I suppose, and the\nvelvety softness a physical one. One could only think, somehow, of wild\npansies--the brown kind. If Winnebago had taken the trouble to glance\nat the title of the book she laid face down on the pencil boxes as you\nentered, it would have learned that the book was one of Balzac's, or,\nperhaps, Zangwill's, or Zola's. She never could overcome that habit\nof snatching a chapter here and there during dull moments. She was too\ntired to read when night came.\n\nThere were many times when the little Wisconsin town lay broiling in\nthe August sun, or locked in the January drifts, and the main business\nstreet was as silent as that of a deserted village. But more often she\ncame forward to you from the rear of the store, with bits of excelsior\nclinging to her black sateen apron. You knew that she had been helping\nAloysius as he unpacked a consignment of chamber sets or a hogshead of\nchina or glassware, chalking each piece with the price mark as it was\ndug from its nest of straw and paper.\n\n“How do you do!” she would say. “What can I do for you?” And in that\nmoment she had you listed, indexed, and filed, were you a farmer woman\nin a black shawl and rusty bonnet with a faded rose bobbing grotesquely\natop it, or one of the patronizing East End set who came to Brandeis'\nBazaar because Mrs. Brandeis' party favors, for one thing, were of a\nvariety that could be got nowhere else this side of Chicago. If, after\ngreeting you, Mrs. Brandeis called, “Sadie! Stockings!” (supposing\nstockings were your quest), you might know that Mrs. Brandeis had\nweighed you and found you wanting.\n\nThere had always been a store--at least, ever since Fanny could\nremember. She often thought how queer it would seem to have to buy pins,\nor needles, or dishes, or soap, or thread. The store held all these\nthings, and many more. Just to glance at the bewildering display outside\ngave you promise of the variety within. Winnebago was rather ashamed of\nthat display. It was before the day of repression in decoration, and\nthe two benches in front of the windows overflowed with lamps, and\nwater sets, and brooms, and boilers and tinware and hampers. Once the\nWinnebago Courier had had a sarcastic editorial about what they called\nthe Oriental bazaar (that was after the editor, Lem Davis, had bumped\nhis shin against a toy cart that protruded unduly), but Mrs. Brandeis\nchanged nothing. She knew that the farmer women who stood outside with\ntheir husbands on busy Saturdays would not have understood repression\nin display, but they did understand the tickets that marked the wares in\nplain figures--this berry set, $1.59; that lamp, $1.23. They talked it\nover, outside, and drifted away, and came back, and entered, and bought.\n\nShe knew when to be old-fashioned, did Mrs. Brandeis, and when to be\nmodern. She had worn the first short walking skirt in Winnebago. It\ncleared the ground in a day before germs were discovered, when women's\nskirts trailed and flounced behind them in a cloud of dust. One of her\nscandalized neighbors (Mrs. Nathan Pereles, it was) had taken her aside\nto tell her that no decent woman would dress that way.\n\n“Next year,” said Mrs. Brandeis, “when you are wearing one, I'll remind\nyou of that.” And she did, too. She had worn shirtwaists with a broad\n“Gibson” shoulder tuck, when other Winnebago women were still encased\nin linings and bodices. Do not get the impression that she stood for\nemancipation, or feminism, or any of those advanced things. They had\nscarcely been touched on in those days. She was just an extraordinarily\nalert woman, mentally and physically, with a shrewd sense of values.\nMolly Brandeis never could set a table without forgetting the spoons, or\nthe salt, or something, but she could add a double column of figures in\nher head as fast as her eye could travel.\n\nThere she goes, running off with the story, as we were afraid she would.\nNot only that, she is using up whole pages of description when she\nshould be giving us dialogue. Prospective readers, running their\neyes over a printed page, object to the solid block formation of the\ndescriptive passage. And yet it is fascinating to weave words about her,\nas it is fascinating to turn a fine diamond this way and that in the\nsunlight, to catch its prismatic hues. Besides, you want to know--do you\nnot?--how this woman who reads Balzac should be waiting upon you in a\nlittle general store in Winnebago, Wisconsin?\n\nIn the first place, Ferdinand Brandeis had been a dreamer, and a\npotential poet, which is bad equipment for success in the business of\ngeneral merchandise. Four times, since her marriage, Molly Brandeis had\npacked her household goods, bade her friends good-by, and with her two\nchildren, Fanny and Theodore, had followed her husband to pastures new.\nA heart-breaking business, that, but broadening. She knew nothing of the\nart of buying and selling at the time of her marriage, but as the\nyears went by she learned unconsciously the things one should not do\nin business, from watching Ferdinand Brandeis do them all. She even\nsuggested this change and that, but to no avail. Ferdinand Brandeis\nwas a gentle and lovable man at home; a testy, quick-tempered one in\nbusiness.\n\nThat was because he had been miscast from the first, and yet had played\none part too long, even though unsuccessfully, ever to learn another. He\ndid not make friends with the genial traveling salesmen who breezed in,\nslapped him on the back, offered him a cigar, inquired after his health,\nopened their sample cases and flirted with the girl clerks, all in a\nbreath. He was a man who talked little, listened little, learned little.\nHe had never got the trick of turning his money over quickly--that trick\nso necessary to the success of the small-town business.\n\nSo it was that, in the year preceding Ferdinand Brandeis' death, there\ncame often to the store a certain grim visitor. Herman Walthers, cashier\nof the First National Bank of Winnebago, was a kindly-enough, shrewd,\nsmall-town banker, but to Ferdinand Brandeis and his wife his visits,\ngrowing more and more frequent, typified all that was frightful,\npresaged misery and despair. He would drop in on a bright summer\nmorning, perhaps, with a cheerful greeting. He would stand for a moment\nat the front of the store, balancing airily from toe to heel, and\nglancing about from shelf to bin and back again in a large, speculative\nway. Then he would begin to walk slowly and ruminatively about, his\nshrewd little German eyes appraising the stock. He would hum a little\nabsent-minded tune as he walked, up one aisle and down the next (there\nwere only two), picking up a piece of china there, turning it over to\nlook at its stamp, holding it up to the light, tapping it a bit with his\nknuckles, and putting it down carefully before going musically on down\nthe aisle to the water sets, the lamps, the stockings, the hardware, the\ntoys. And so, his hands behind his back, still humming, out the swinging\nscreen door and into the sunshine of Elm Street, leaving gloom and fear\nbehind him.\n\nOne year after Molly Brandeis took hold, Herman Walthers' visits ceased,\nand in two years he used to rise to greet her from his little cubbyhole\nwhen she came into the bank.\n\nWhich brings us to the plush photograph album. The plush photograph\nalbum is a concrete example of what makes business failure and success.\nMore than that, its brief history presents a complete characterization\nof Ferdinand and Molly Brandeis.\n\nTen years before, Ferdinand Brandeis had bought a large bill of\nChristmas fancy-goods--celluloid toilette sets, leather collar boxes,\nvelvet glove cases. Among the lot was a photograph album in the shape of\na huge acorn done in lightning-struck plush. It was a hideous thing, and\nexpensive. It stood on a brass stand, and its leaves were edged in gilt,\nand its color was a nauseous green and blue, and it was altogether the\nsort of thing to grace the chill and funereal best room in a Wisconsin\nfarmhouse. Ferdinand Brandeis marked it at six dollars and stood it\nup for the Christmas trade. That had been ten years before. It was too\nexpensive; or too pretentious, or perhaps even too horrible for the\nbucolic purse. At any rate, it had been taken out, brushed, dusted, and\nplaced on its stand every holiday season for ten years. On the day after\nChristmas it was always there, its lightning-struck plush face staring\nwildly out upon the ravaged fancy-goods counter. It would be packed\nin its box again and consigned to its long summer's sleep. It had seen\nthree towns, and many changes. The four dollars that Ferdinand Brandeis\nhad invested in it still remained unturned.\n\nOne snowy day in November (Ferdinand Brandeis died a fortnight later)\nMrs. Brandeis, entering the store, saw two women standing at the\nfancy-goods counter, laughing in a stifled sort of way. One of them was\nbowing elaborately to a person unseen. Mrs. Brandeis was puzzled. She\nwatched them for a moment, interested. One of the women was known to\nher. She came up to them and put her question, bluntly, though her quick\nwits had already given her a suspicion of the truth.\n\n“What are you bowing to?”\n\nThe one who had done the bowing blushed a little, but giggled too, as\nshe said, “I'm greeting my old friend, the plush album. I've seen it\nhere every Christmas for five years.”\n\nFerdinand Brandeis died suddenly a little more than a week later. It was\na terrible period, and one that might have prostrated a less resolute\nand balanced woman. There were long-standing debts, not to speak of the\nentire stock of holiday goods to be paid for. The day after the funeral\nWinnebago got a shock. The Brandeis house was besieged by condoling\ncallers. Every member of the little Jewish congregation of Winnebago\ncame, of course, as they had come before the funeral. Those who had not\nbrought cakes, and salads, and meats, and pies, brought them now, as was\nthe invariable custom in time of mourning.\n\nOthers of the townspeople called, too; men and women who had known and\nrespected Ferdinand Brandeis. And the shock they got was this: Mrs.\nBrandeis was out. Any one could have told you that she should have been\nsitting at home in a darkened room, wearing a black gown, clasping\nFanny and Theodore to her, and holding a black-bordered handkerchief at\nintervals to her reddened eyes. And that is what she really wanted to\ndo, for she had loved her husband, and she respected the conventions.\nWhat she did was to put on a white shirtwaist and a black skirt at seven\no'clock the morning after the funeral.\n\nThe store had been closed the day before. She entered it at seven\nforty-five, as Aloysius was sweeping out with wet sawdust and a languid\nbroom. The extra force of holiday clerks straggled in, uncertainly, at\neight or after, expecting an hour or two of undisciplined gossip. At\neight-ten Molly Brandeis walked briskly up to the plush photograph\nalbum, whisked off its six-dollar price mark, and stuck in its place\na neatly printed card bearing these figures: “To-day--79 cents!” The plush\nalbum went home in a farmer's wagon that afternoon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nRight here there should be something said about Fanny Brandeis. And yet,\neach time I turn to her I find her mother plucking at my sleeve. There\ncomes to my mind the picture of Mrs. Brandeis turning down Norris Street\nat quarter to eight every morning, her walk almost a march, so firm and\nmeasured it was, her head high, her chin thrust forward a little, as a\nfighter walks, but not pugnaciously; her short gray skirt clearing the\nground, her shoulders almost consciously squared. Other Winnebago women\nwere just tying up their daughters' pigtails for school, or sweeping the\nfront porch, or watering the hanging baskets. Norris Street residents\ngot into the habit of timing themselves by Mrs. Brandeis. When she\nmarched by at seven forty-five they hurried a little with the tying of\nthe hair bow, as they glanced out of the window. When she came by again,\na little before twelve, for her hasty dinner, they turned up the fire\nunder the potatoes and stirred the flour thickening for the gravy.\n\nMrs. Brandeis had soon learned that Fanny and Theodore could manage\ntheir own school toilettes, with, perhaps, some speeding up on the part\nof Mattie, the servant girl. But it needed her keen brown eye to detect\ncorners that Aloysius had neglected to sweep out with wet sawdust, and\nher presence to make sure that the counter covers were taken off and\nfolded, the outside show dusted and arranged, the windows washed, the\nwhole store shining and ready for business by eight o'clock. So Fanny\nhad even learned to do her own tight, shiny, black, shoulder-length\ncurls, which she tied back with a black bow. They were wet, meek, and\ntractable curls at eight in the morning. By the time school was out\nat four they were as wildly unruly as if charged with electric\ncurrents--which they really were, when you consider the little dynamo\nthat wore them.\n\nMrs. Brandeis took a scant half hour to walk the six blocks between\nthe store and the house, to snatch a hurried dinner, and traverse the\ndistance to the store again. It was a program that would have killed a\nwoman less magnificently healthy and determined. She seemed to thrive on\nit, and she kept her figure and her wit when other women of her age grew\ndull, and heavy, and ineffectual. On summer days the little town often\nlay shimmering in the heat, the yellow road glaring in it, the red\nbricks of the high school reflecting it in waves, the very pine knots\nin the sidewalks gummy and resinous with heat, and sending up a pungent\nsmell that was of the woods, and yet stifling. She must have felt an\nalmost irresistible temptation to sit for a moment on the cool, shady\nfront porch, with its green-painted flower boxes, its hanging fern\nbaskets and the catalpa tree looking boskily down upon it.\n\nBut she never did. She had an almost savage energy and determination.\nThe unpaid debts were ever ahead of her; there were the children to be\ndressed and sent to school; there was the household to be kept up; there\nwere Theodore's violin lessons that must not be neglected--not after\nwhat Professor Bauer had said about him.\n\nYou may think that undue stress is being laid upon this driving force\nin her, upon this business ability. But remember that this was fifteen\nyears or more ago, before women had invaded the world of business by the\nthousands, to take their place, side by side, salary for salary, with\nmen. Oh, there were plenty of women wage earners in Winnebago, as\nelsewhere; clerks, stenographers, school teachers, bookkeepers. The\npaper mills were full of girls, and the canning factory too. But here\nwas a woman gently bred, untrained in business, left widowed with two\nchildren at thirty-eight, and worse than penniless--in debt.\n\nAnd that was not all. As Ferdinand Brandeis' wife she had occupied a\ncertain social position in the little Jewish community of Winnebago.\nTrue, they had never been moneyed, while the others of her own faith\nin the little town were wealthy, and somewhat purse-proud. They had\ncarriages, most of them, with two handsome horses, and their houses\nwere spacious and veranda-encircled, and set in shady lawns. When the\nBrandeis family came to Winnebago five years before, these people had\nwaited, cautiously, and investigated, and then had called. They were\nof a type to be found in every small town; prosperous, conservative,\nconstructive citizens, clannish, but not so much so as their city\ncousins, mingling socially with their Gentile neighbors, living well,\nspending their money freely, taking a vast pride in the education of\ntheir children. But here was Molly Brandeis, a Jewess, setting out\nto earn her living in business, like a man. It was a thing to stir\nCongregation Emanu-el to its depths. Jewish women, they would tell you,\ndid not work thus. Their husbands worked for them, or their sons, or\ntheir brothers.\n\n“Oh, I don't know,” said Mrs. Brandeis, when she heard of it. “I seem\nto remember a Jewess named Ruth who was left widowed, and who gleaned in\nthe fields for her living, and yet the neighbors didn't talk. For that\nmatter, she seems to be pretty well thought of, to this day.”\n\nBut there is no denying that she lost caste among her own people. Custom\nand training are difficult to overcome. But Molly Brandeis was too\ndeep in her own affairs to care. That Christmas season following her\nhusband's death was a ghastly time, and yet a grimly wonderful one, for\nit applied the acid test to Molly Brandeis and showed her up pure gold.\n\nThe first week in January she, with Sadie and Pearl, the two clerks,\nand Aloysius, the boy, took inventory. It was a terrifying thing,\nthat process of casting up accounts. It showed with such starkness how\nhideously the Brandeis ledger sagged on the wrong side. The three women\nand the boy worked with a sort of dogged cheerfulness at it, counting,\nmarking, dusting, washing. They found shelves full of forgotten stock,\ndust-covered and profitless. They found many articles of what is known\nas hard stock, akin to the plush album; glass and plated condiment\ncasters for the dining table, in a day when individual salts and\nseparate vinegar cruets were already the thing; lamps with straight\nwicks when round wicks were in demand.\n\nThey scoured shelves, removed the grime of years from boxes, washed\nwhole battalions of chamber sets, bathed piles of plates, and bins of\ncups and saucers. It was a dirty, back-breaking job, that ruined the\nfinger nails, tried the disposition, and caked the throat with\ndust. Besides, the store was stove-heated and, near the front door,\nuncomfortably cold. The women wore little shoulder shawls pinned over\ntheir waists, for warmth, and all four, including Aloysius, sniffled for\nweeks afterward. That inventory developed a new, grim line around Mrs.\nBrandeis' mouth, and carved another at the corner of each eye. After it\nwas over she washed her hair, steamed her face over a bowl of hot water,\npacked two valises, left minute and masterful instructions with Mattie\nas to the household, and with Sadie and Pearl as to the store, and was\noff to Chicago on her first buying trip. She took Fanny with her, as\nballast. It was a trial at which many men would have quailed. On the\nshrewdness and judgment of that buying trip depended the future of\nBrandeis' Bazaar, and Mrs. Brandeis, and Fanny, and Theodore.\n\nMrs. Brandeis had accompanied her husband on many of his trips to\nChicago. She had even gone with him occasionally to the wholesale houses\naround La Salle Street, and Madison, and Fifth Avenue, but she had\nnever bought a dollar's worth herself. She saw that he bought slowly,\ncautiously, and without imagination. She made up her mind that she would\nbuy quickly, intuitively. She knew slightly some of the salesmen in\nthe wholesale houses. They had often made presents to her of a vase,\na pocketbook, a handkerchief, or some such trifle, which she accepted\nreluctantly, when at all. She was thankful now for these visits. She\nfound herself remembering many details of them. She made up her mind,\nwith a canny knowingness, that there should be no presents this time, no\ntheater invitations, no lunches or dinners. This was business, she told\nherself; more than business--it was grim war.\n\nThey still tell of that trip, sometimes, when buyers and jobbers and\nwholesale men get together. Don't imagine that she came to be a woman\ncaptain of finance. Don't think that we are to see her at the head of\na magnificent business establishment, with buyers and department heads\nbelow her, and a private office done up in mahogany, and stenographers\nand secretaries. No, she was Mrs. Brandeis, of Brandeis' Bazaar, to the\nend. The bills she bought were ridiculously small, I suppose, and the\ntricks she turned on that first trip were pitiful, perhaps. But they\nwere magnificent too, in their way. I am even bold enough to think that\nshe might have made business history, that plucky woman, if she had had\nan earlier start, and if she had not, to the very end, had a pack of\nunmanageable handicaps yelping at her heels, pulling at her skirts.\n\nIt was only a six-hour trip to Chicago. Fanny Brandeis' eyes, big enough\nat any time, were surely twice their size during the entire journey of\ntwo hundred miles or more. They were to have lunch on the train! They\nwere to stop at an hotel! They were to go to the theater! She would have\nlain back against the red plush seat of the car, in a swoon of joy, if\nthere had not been so much to see in the car itself, and through the car\nwindow.\n\n“We'll have something for lunch,” said Mrs. Brandeis when they were\nseated in the dining car, “that we never have at home, shall we?”\n\n“Oh, yes!” replied Fanny in a whisper of excitement.\n“Something--something queer, and different, and not so very healthy!”\n\nThey had oysters (a New Yorker would have sniffed at them), and chicken\npotpie, and asparagus, and ice cream. If that doesn't prove Mrs.\nBrandeis was game, I should like to know what could! They stopped at\nthe Windsor-Clifton, because it was quieter and less expensive than the\nPalmer House, though quite as full of red plush and walnut. Besides,\nshe had stopped at the Palmer House with her husband, and she knew how\nbuyers were likely to be besieged by eager salesmen with cards, and with\ntempting lines of goods spread knowingly in the various sample-rooms.\n\nFanny Brandeis was thirteen, and emotional, and incredibly receptive\nand alive. It is impossible to tell what she learned during that Chicago\ntrip, it was so crowded, so wonderful. She went with her mother to the\nwholesale houses and heard and saw and, unconsciously, remembered. When\nshe became fatigued with the close air of the dim showrooms, with their\nendless aisles piled with every sort of ware, she would sit on a\nchair in some obscure corner, watching those sleek, over-lunched,\ngenial-looking salesmen who were chewing their cigars somewhat wildly\nwhen Mrs. Brandeis finished with them. Sometimes she did not accompany\nher mother, but lay in bed, deliciously, until the middle of the\nmorning, then dressed, and chatted with the obliging Irish chamber maid,\nand read until her mother came for her at noon.\n\nEverything she did was a delightful adventure; everything she saw had\nthe tang of novelty. Fanny Brandeis was to see much that was beautiful\nand rare in her full lifetime, but she never again, perhaps, got\nquite the thrill that those ugly, dim, red-carpeted, gas-lighted hotel\ncorridors gave her, or the grim bedroom, with its walnut furniture and\nits Nottingham curtains. As for the Chicago streets themselves, with\ntheir perilous corners (there were no czars in blue to regulate traffic\nin those days), older and more sophisticated pedestrians experienced\nvarious emotions while negotiating the corner of State and Madison.\n\nThat buying trip lasted ten days. It was a racking business, physically\nand mentally. There were the hours of tramping up one aisle and down the\nother in the big wholesale lofts. But that brought bodily fatigue only.\nIt was the mental strain that left Mrs. Brandeis spent and limp at the\nend of the day. Was she buying wisely? Was she over-buying? What did\nshe know about buying, anyway? She would come back to her hotel at six,\nsometimes so exhausted that the dining-room and dinner were unthinkable.\nAt such times they would have dinner in their room another delicious\nadventure for Fanny. She would try to tempt the fagged woman on the bed\nwith bits of this or that from one of the many dishes that dotted the\ndinner tray. But Molly Brandeis, harrowed in spirit and numbed in body,\nwas too spent to eat.\n\nBut that was not always the case. There was that unforgettable night\nwhen they went to see Bernhardt the divine. Fanny spent the entire\nmorning following standing before the bedroom mirror, with her hair\npulled out in a wild fluff in front, her mother's old marten-fur\nscarf high and choky around her neck, trying to smile that slow, sad,\npoignant, tear-compelling smile; but she had to give it up, clever\nmimic though she was. She only succeeded in looking as though a pin were\nsticking her somewhere. Besides, Fanny's own smile was a quick, broad,\nflashing grin, with a generous glint of white teeth in it, and she\nalways forgot about being exquisitely wistful over it until it was too\nlate.\n\nI wonder if the story of the china religious figures will give a wrong\nimpression of Mrs. Brandeis. Perhaps not, if you will only remember this\nwoman's white-lipped determination to wrest a livelihood from the world,\nfor her children and herself. They had been in Chicago a week, and she\nwas buying at Bauder & Peck's. Now, Bauder & Peck, importers, are known\nthe world over. It is doubtful if there is one of you who has not been\nsupplied, indirectly, with some imported bit of china or glassware, with\nFrench opera glasses or cunning toys and dolls, from the great New York\nand Chicago showrooms of that company.\n\nYoung Bauder himself was waiting on Mrs. Brandeis, and he was frowning\nbecause he hated to sell women. Young Bauder was being broken into the\nChicago end of the business, and he was not taking gracefully to the\nprocess.\n\nAt the end of a long aisle, on an obscure shelf in a dim corner, Molly\nBrandeis' sharp eyes espied a motley collection of dusty, grimy\nchina figures of the kind one sees on the mantel in the parlor of\nthe small-town Catholic home. Winnebago's population was two-thirds\nCatholic, German and Irish, and very devout.\n\nMrs. Brandeis stopped short. “How much for that lot?” She pointed to the\nshelf. Young Bauder's gaze followed hers, puzzled. The figures were from\nfive inches to a foot high, in crude, effective blues, and gold, and\ncrimson, and white. All the saints were there in assorted sizes, the\nPieta, the cradle in the manger. There were probably two hundred or\nmore of the little figures. “Oh, those!” said young Bauder vaguely. “You\ndon't want that stuff. Now, about that Limoges china. As I said, I can\nmake you a special price on it if you carry it as an open-stock pattern.\nYou'll find----”\n\n“How much for that lot?” repeated Mrs. Brandeis.\n\n“Those are left-over samples, Mrs. Brandeis. Last year's stuff. They're\nall dirty. I'd forgotten they were there.”\n\n“How much for the lot?” said Mrs. Brandeis, pleasantly, for the third\ntime.\n\n“I really don't know. Three hundred, I should say. But----”\n\n“I'll give you two hundred,” ventured Mrs. Brandeis, her heart in her\nmouth and her mouth very firm.\n\n“Oh, come now, Mrs. Brandeis! Bauder & Peck don't do business that way,\nyou know. We'd really rather not sell them at all. The things aren't\nworth much to us, or to you, for that matter. But three hundred----”\n\n“Two hundred,” repeated Mrs. Brandeis, “or I cancel my order, including\nthe Limoges. I want those figures.”\n\nAnd she got them. Which isn't the point of the story. The holy figures\nwere fine examples of foreign workmanship, their colors, beneath\nthe coating of dust, as brilliant and fadeless as those found in the\nchurches of Europe. They reached Winnebago duly, packed in straw and\npaper, still dusty and shelf-worn. Mrs. Brandeis and Sadie and Pearl sat\non up-ended boxes at the rear of the store, in the big barn-like room in\nwhich newly arrived goods were unpacked. As Aloysius dived deep into the\ncrate and brought up figure after figure, the three women plunged them\ninto warm and soapy water and proceeded to bathe and scour the entire\nschool of saints, angels, and cherubim. They came out brilliantly fresh\nand rosy.\n\nAll the Irish ingenuity and artistry in Aloysius came to the surface\nas he dived again and again into the great barrel and brought up the\nglittering pieces.\n\n“It'll make an elegant window,” he gasped from the depths of the hay,\nhis lean, lengthy frame jack-knifed over the edge. “And cheap.” His\nshrewd wit had long ago divined the store's price mark. “If Father\nFitzpatrick steps by in the forenoon I'll bet they'll be gone before\nnighttime to-morrow. You'll be letting me do the trim, Mrs. Brandeis?”\n\nHe came back that evening to do it, and he threw his whole soul into it,\nwhich, considering his ancestry and temperament, was very high voltage\nfor one small-town store window. He covered the floor of the window with\nblack crepe paper, and hung it in long folds, like a curtain, against\nthe rear wall. The gilt of the scepters, and halos, and capes showed up\ndazzlingly against this background. The scarlets, and pinks, and blues,\nand whites of the robes appeared doubly bright. The whole made a picture\nthat struck and held you by its vividness and contrast.\n\nFather Fitzpatrick, very tall and straight, and handsome, with his\niron-gray hair and his cheeks pink as a girl's, did step by next morning\non his way to the post-office. It was whispered that in his youth Father\nFitzpatrick had been an actor, and that he had deserted the footlights\nfor the altar lights because of a disappointment. The drama's loss was\nthe Church's gain. You should have heard him on Sunday morning, now\nflaying them, now swaying them! He still had the actor's flexible voice,\nvibrant, tremulous, or strident, at will. And no amount of fasting or\npraying had ever dimmed that certain something in his eye--the something\nwhich makes the matinee idol.\n\nNot only did he step by now; he turned, came back; stopped before the\nwindow. Then he entered.\n\n“Madam,” he said to Mrs. Brandeis, “you'll probably save more souls with\nyour window display than I could in a month of hell-fire sermons.” He\nraised his hand. “You have the sanction of the Church.” Which was the\nbeginning of a queer friendship between the Roman Catholic priest and\nthe Jewess shopkeeper that lasted as long as Molly Brandeis lived.\n\nBy noon it seemed that the entire population of Winnebago had turned\ndevout. The figures, a tremendous bargain, though sold at a high profit,\nseemed to melt away from the counter that held them.\n\nBy three o'clock, “Only one to a customer!” announced Mrs. Brandeis. By\nthe middle of the week the window itself was ravished of its show. By\nthe end of the week there remained only a handful of the duller and less\ndesirable pieces--the minor saints, so to speak. Saturday night Mrs.\nBrandeis did a little figuring on paper. The lot had cost her two\nhundred dollars. She had sold for six hundred. Two from six leaves four.\nFour hundred dollars! She repeated it to herself, quietly. Her mind\nleaped back to the plush photograph album, then to young Bauder and his\ncool contempt. And there stole over her that warm, comfortable glow born\nof reassurance and triumph. Four hundred dollars. Not much in these\ndays of big business. We said, you will remember, that it was a pitiful\nenough little trick she turned to make it, though an honest one. And--in\nthe face of disapproval--a rather magnificent one too. For it gave to\nMolly Brandeis that precious quality, self-confidence, out of which is\nborn success.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nBy spring Mrs. Brandeis had the farmer women coming to her for their\nthreshing dishes and kitchenware, and the West End Culture Club for\ntheir whist prizes. She seemed to realize that the days of the general\nstore were numbered, and she set about making hers a novelty store.\nThere was something terrible about the earnestness with which she\nstuck to business. She was not more than thirty-eight at this time,\nintelligent, healthy, fun-loving. But she stayed at it all day. She\nlistened and chatted to every one, and learned much. There was about her\nthat human quality that invites confidence.\n\nShe made friends by the hundreds, and friends are a business asset.\nThose blithe, dressy, and smooth-spoken gentlemen known as traveling men\nused to tell her their troubles, perched on a stool near the stove, and\nshow her the picture of their girl in the back of their watch, and asked\nher to dinner at the Haley House. She listened to their tale of woe,\nand advised them; she admired the picture of the girl, and gave some\nwholesome counsel on the subject of traveling men's lonely wives; but\nshe never went to dinner at the Haley House.\n\nIt had not taken these debonair young men long to learn that there was a\nwoman buyer who bought quickly, decisively, and intelligently, and that\nshe always demanded a duplicate slip. Even the most unscrupulous could\nnot stuff an order of hers, and when it came to dating she gave no\nquarter. Though they wore clothes that were two leaps ahead of the\nstyles worn by the Winnebago young men--their straw sailors were likely\nto be saw-edged when the local edges were smooth, and their coats were\nmore flaring, or their trousers wider than the coats and trousers of\nthe Winnebago boys--they were not, for the most part, the gay dogs that\nWinnebago's fancy painted them. Many of them were very lonely married\nmen who missed their wives and babies, and loathed the cuspidored\ndiscomfort of the small-town hotel lobby. They appreciated Mrs.\nBrandeis' good-natured sympathy, and gave her the long end of a deal\nwhen they could. It was Sam Kiser who had begged her to listen to\nhis advice to put in Battenberg patterns and braid, long before the\nBattenberg epidemic had become widespread and virulent.\n\n“Now listen to me, Mrs. Brandeis,” he begged, almost tearfully. “You're\na smart woman. Don't let this get by you. You know that I know that a\nsalesman would have as much chance to sell you a gold brick as to sell\nold John D. Rockefeller a gallon of oil.” Mrs. Brandeis eyed his samples\ncoldly. “But it looks so unattractive. And the average person has\nno imagination. A bolt of white braid and a handful of buttons--they\nwouldn't get a mental picture of the completed piece. Now, embroidery\nsilk----”\n\n“Then give 'em a real picture!” interrupted Sam. “Work up one of these\nwater-lily pattern table covers. Use No. 100 braid and the smallest\nbuttons. Stick it in the window and they'll tear their hair to get\npatterns.”\n\nShe did it, taking turns with Pearl and Sadie at weaving the great, lacy\nsquare during dull moments. When it was finished they placed it in\nthe window, where it lay like frosted lace, exquisitely graceful and\ndelicate, with its tracery of curling petals and feathery fern sprays.\nWinnebago gazed and was bitten by the Battenberg bug. It wound itself up\nin a network of Battenberg braid, in all the numbers. It bought\nbuttons of every size; it stitched away at Battenberg covers, doilies,\nbedspreads, blouses, curtains. Battenberg tumbled, foamed, cascaded over\nWinnebago's front porches all that summer. Listening to Sam Kiser had\ndone it.\n\nShe listened to the farmer women too, and to the mill girls, and to the\nscant and precious pearls that dropped from the lips of the East End\nsociety section. There was something about her brown eyes and her\nstraight, sensible nose that reassured them so that few suspected the\nmischievous in her. For she was mischievous. If she had not been I think\nshe could not have stood the drudgery, and the heartbreaks, and the\nstruggle, and the terrific manual labor.\n\nShe used to guy people, gently, and they never guessed it. Mrs. G.\nManville Smith, for example, never dreamed of the joy that her patronage\nbrought Molly Brandeis, who waited on her so demurely. Mrs. G. Manville\nSmith (nee Finnegan) scorned the Winnebago shops, and was said to send\nto Chicago for her hairpins. It was known that her household was run on\nthe most niggardly basis, however, and she short-rationed her two maids\noutrageously. It was said that she could serve less real food on more\nreal lace doilies than any other housekeeper in Winnebago. Now, Mrs.\nBrandeis sold Scourine two cents cheaper than the grocery stores, using\nit as an advertisement to attract housewives, and making no profit on\nthe article itself. Mrs. G. Manville Smith always patronized Brandeis'\nBazaar for Scourine alone, and thus represented pure loss. Also she\nmy-good-womaned Mrs. Brandeis. That lady, seeing her enter one day with\nher comic, undulating gait, double-actioned like a giraffe's, and her\nplumes that would have shamed a Knight of Pythias, decided to put a stop\nto these unprofitable visits.\n\nShe waited on Mrs. G. Manville Smith, a dangerous gleam in her eye.\n\n“Scourine,” spake Mrs. G. Manville Smith.\n\n“How many?”\n\n“A dozen.”\n\n“Anything else?”\n\n“No. Send them.”\n\nMrs. Brandeis, scribbling in her sales book, stopped, pencil poised. “We\ncannot send Scourine unless with a purchase of other goods amounting to\na dollar or more.”\n\nMrs. G. Manville Smith's plumes tossed and soared agitatedly. “But my\ngood woman, I don't want anything else!”\n\n“Then you'll have to carry the Scourine?”\n\n“Certainly not! I'll send for it.”\n\n“The sale closes at five.” It was then 4:57.\n\n“I never heard of such a thing! You can't expect me to carry them.”\n\nNow, Mrs. G. Manville Smith had been a dining-room girl at the old Haley\nHouse before she married George Smith, and long before he made his money\nin lumber.\n\n“You won't find them so heavy,” Molly Brandeis said smoothly.\n\n“I certainly would! Perhaps you would not. You're used to that sort of\nthing. Rough work, and all that.”\n\nAloysius, doubled up behind the lamps, knew what was coming, from the\ngleam in his boss's eye.\n\n“There may be something in that,” Molly Brandeis returned sweetly.\n“That's why I thought you might not mind taking them. They're really not\nmuch heavier than a laden tray.”\n\n“Oh!” exclaimed the outraged Mrs. G. Manville Smith. And took her plumes\nand her patronage out of Brandeis' Bazaar forever.\n\nThat was as malicious as Molly Brandeis ever could be. And it was\nforgivable malice.\n\nMost families must be described against the background of their homes,\nbut the Brandeis family life was bounded and controlled by the store.\nTheir meals and sleeping hours and amusements were regulated by it.\nIt taught them much, and brought them much, and lost them much. Fanny\nBrandeis always said she hated it, but it made her wise, and tolerant,\nand, in the end, famous. I don't know what more one could ask of any\ninstitution. It brought her in contact with men and women, taught her\nhow to deal with them. After school she used often to run down to the\nstore to see her mother, while Theodore went home to practice. Perched\non a high stool in some corner she heard, and saw, and absorbed. It\nwas a great school for the sensitive, highly-organized, dramatic little\nJewish girl, for, to paraphrase a well-known stage line, there are just\nas many kinds of people in Winnebago as there are in Washington.\n\nIt was about this time that Fanny Brandeis began to realize, actively,\nthat she was different. Of course, other little Winnebago girls' mothers\ndid not work like a man, in a store. And she and Bella Weinberg were the\nonly two in her room at school who stayed out on the Day of Atonement,\nand on New Year, and the lesser Jewish holidays. Also, she went to\ntemple on Friday night and Saturday morning, when the other girls she\nknew went to church on Sunday. These things set her apart in the little\nMiddle Western town; but it was not these that constituted the real\ndifference. She played, and slept, and ate, and studied like the\nother healthy little animals of her age. The real difference was\ntemperamental, or emotional, or dramatic, or historic, or all four. They\nwould be playing tag, perhaps, in one of the cool, green ravines that\nwere the beauty spots of the little Wisconsin town.\n\nThey nestled like exquisite emeralds in the embrace of the hills, those\nravines, and Winnebago's civic surge had not yet swept them away in a\ndeluge of old tin cans, ashes, dirt and refuse, to be sold later for\nbuilding lots. The Indians had camped and hunted in them. The one under\nthe Court Street bridge, near the Catholic church and monastery, was\nthe favorite for play. It lay, a lovely, gracious thing, below the\nhot little town, all green, and lush, and cool, a tiny stream dimpling\nthrough it. The plump Capuchin Fathers, in their coarse brown robes,\nknotted about the waist with a cord, their bare feet thrust into\nsandals, would come out and sun themselves on the stone bench at the\nside of the monastery on the hill, or would potter about the garden.\nAnd suddenly Fanny would stop quite still in the midst of her tag game,\nstruck with the beauty of the picture it called from the past.\n\nLittle Oriental that she was, she was able to combine the dry text of\nher history book with the green of the trees, the gray of the church,\nand the brown of the monk's robes, and evolve a thrilling mental picture\ntherefrom. The tag game and her noisy little companions vanished. She\nwas peopling the place with stealthy Indians. Stealthy, cunning, yet\nsavagely brave. They bore no relation to the abject, contemptible, and\nrather smelly Oneidas who came to the back door on summer mornings, in\ncalico, and ragged overalls, with baskets of huckleberries on their\narm, their pride gone, a broken and conquered people. She saw them wild,\nfree, sovereign, and there were no greasy, berry-peddling Oneidas among\nthem. They were Sioux, and Pottawatomies (that last had the real Indian\nsound), and Winnebagos, and Menomonees, and Outagamis. She made\nthem taciturn, and beady-eyed, and lithe, and fleet, and every other\nadjectival thing her imagination and history book could supply. The\nfat and placid Capuchin Fathers on the hill became Jesuits, sinister,\nsilent, powerful, with France and the Church of Rome behind them. From\nthe shelter of that big oak would step Nicolet, the brave, first among\nWisconsin explorers, and last to receive the credit for his hardihood.\nJean Nicolet! She loved the sound of it. And with him was La Salle,\nstraight, and slim, and elegant, and surely wearing ruffles and plumes\nand sword even in a canoe. And Tonty, his Italian friend and fellow\nadventurer--Tonty of the satins and velvets, graceful, tactful, poised,\na shadowy figure; his menacing iron hand, so feared by the ignorant\nsavages, encased always in a glove. Surely a perfumed g---- Slap! A rude\nshove that jerked her head back sharply and sent her forward, stumbling,\nand jarred her like a fall.\n\n“Ya-a-a! Tag! You're it! Fanny's it!”\n\nIndians, priests, cavaliers, coureurs de bois, all vanished. Fanny would\nstand a moment, blinking stupidly. The next moment she was running\nas fleetly as the best of the boys in savage pursuit of one of her\ncompanions in the tag game.\n\nShe was a strange mixture of tomboy and bookworm, which was a mercifully\nkind arrangement for both body and mind. The spiritual side of her was\ngroping and staggering and feeling its way about as does that of any\nlittle girl whose mind is exceptionally active, and whose mother is\nunusually busy. It was on the Day of Atonement, known in the Hebrew as\nYom Kippur, in the year following her father's death that that side of\nher performed a rather interesting handspring.\n\nFanny Brandeis had never been allowed to fast on this, the greatest and\nmost solemn of Jewish holy days Molly Brandeis' modern side refused\nto countenance the practice of withholding food from any child for\ntwenty-four hours. So it was in the face of disapproval that Fanny,\nmaking deep inroads into the steak and fried sweet potatoes at supper on\nthe eve of the Day of Atonement, announced her intention of fasting from\nthat meal to supper on the following evening. She had just passed her\nplate for a third helping of potatoes. Theodore, one lap behind her in\nthe race, had entered his objection.\n\n“Well, for the land's sakes!” he protested. “I guess you're not the only\none who likes sweet potatoes.”\n\nFanny applied a generous dab of butter to an already buttery morsel, and\nchewed it with an air of conscious virtue.\n\n“I've got to eat a lot. This is the last bite I'll have until to-morrow\nnight.”\n\n“What's that?” exclaimed Mrs. Brandeis, sharply.\n\n“Yes, it is!” hooted Theodore.\n\nFanny went on conscientiously eating as she explained.\n\n“Bella Weinberg and I are going to fast all day. We just want to see if\nwe can.”\n\n“Betcha can't,” Theodore said.\n\nMrs. Brandeis regarded her small daughter with a thoughtful gaze. “But\nthat isn't the object in fasting, Fanny--just to see if you can. If\nyou're going to think of food all through the Yom Kippur services----”\n\n“I sha'n't?” protested Fanny passionately. “Theodore would, but I\nwon't.”\n\n“Wouldn't any such thing,” denied Theodore. “But if I'm going to play\na violin solo during the memorial service I guess I've got to eat my\nregular meals.”\n\nTheodore sometimes played at temple, on special occasions. The\nlittle congregation, listening to the throbbing rise and fall of this\nfifteen-year-old boy's violin playing, realized, vaguely, that here was\nsomething disturbingly, harrowingly beautiful. They did not know that\nthey were listening to genius.\n\nMolly Brandeis, in her second best dress, walked to temple Yom Kippur\neve, her son at her right side, her daughter at her left. She had made\nup her mind that she would not let this next day, with its poignantly\nbeautiful service, move her too deeply. It was the first since her\nhusband's death, and Rabbi Thalmann rather prided himself on his\nrendition of the memorial service that came at three in the afternoon.\n\nA man of learning, of sweetness, and of gentle wit was Rabbi Thalmann,\nand unappreciated by his congregation. He stuck to the Scriptures\nfor his texts, finding Moses a greater leader than Roosevelt, and\nthe miracle of the Burning Bush more wonderful than the marvels of\ntwentieth-century wizardy in electricity. A little man, Rabbi Thalmann,\nwith hands and feet as small and delicate as those of a woman. Fanny\nfound him fascinating to look on, in his rabbinical black broadcloth\nand his two pairs of glasses perched, in reading, upon his small hooked\nnose. He stood very straight in the pulpit, but on the street you saw\nthat his back was bent just the least bit in the world--or perhaps it\nwas only his student stoop, as he walked along with his eyes on the\nground, smoking those slender, dapper, pale brown cigars that looked as\nif they had been expressly cut and rolled to fit him.\n\nThe evening service was at seven. The congregation, rustling in silks,\nwas approaching the little temple from all directions. Inside, there was\na low-toned buzz of conversation. The Brandeis' seat was well toward\nthe rear, as befitted a less prosperous member of the rich little\ncongregation. This enabled them to get a complete picture of the room in\nits holiday splendor. Fanny drank it in eagerly, her dark eyes soft\nand luminous. The bare, yellow-varnished wooden pews glowed with the\nreflection from the chandeliers. The seven-branched candlesticks on\neither side of the pulpit were entwined with smilax. The red plush\ncurtain that hung in front of the Ark on ordinary days, and the red\nplush pulpit cover too, were replaced by gleaming white satin edged with\ngold fringe and finished at the corners with heavy gold tassels. How the\nrich white satin glistened in the light of the electric candles! Fanny\nBrandeis loved the lights, and the gleam, and the music, so majestic,\nand solemn, and the sight of the little rabbi, sitting so straight and\nserious in his high-backed chair, or standing to read from the great\nBible. There came to this emotional little Jewess a thrill that was not\nborn of religious fervor at all, I am afraid.\n\nThe sheer drama of the thing got her. In fact, the thing she had set\nherself to do to-day had in it very little of religion. Mrs. Brandeis\nhad been right about that. It was a test of endurance, as planned.\nFanny had never fasted in all her healthy life. She would come home from\nschool to eat formidable stacks of bread and butter, enhanced by brown\nsugar or grape jelly, and topped off with three or four apples from the\nbarrel in the cellar. Two hours later she would attack a supper of fried\npotatoes, and liver, and tea, and peach preserve, and more stacks of\nbread and butter. Then there were the cherry trees in the back yard, and\nthe berry bushes, not to speak of sundry bags of small, hard candies\nof the jelly-bean variety, fitted for quick and secret munching during\nschool. She liked good things to eat, this sturdy little girl, as did\nher friend, that blonde and creamy person, Bella Weinberg. The two girls\nexchanged meaningful glances during the evening service. The Weinbergs,\nas befitted their station, sat in the third row at the right, and Bella\nhad to turn around to convey her silent messages to Fanny. The\nevening service was brief, even to the sermon. Rabbi Thalmann and his\ncongregation would need their strength for to-morrow's trial.\n\nThe Brandeises walked home through the soft September night, and the\nchildren had to use all their Yom Kippur dignity to keep from scuffling\nthrough the piled-up drifts of crackling autumn leaves. Theodore went to\nthe cellar and got an apple, which he ate with what Fanny considered\nan unnecessary amount of scrunching. It was a firm, juicy apple, and it\ngave forth a cracking sound when his teeth met in its white meat. Fanny,\nafter regarding him with gloomy superiority, went to bed.\n\nShe had willed to sleep late, for gastronomic reasons, but the mental\ncommand disobeyed itself, and she woke early, with a heavy feeling.\nEarly as it was, Molly Brandeis had tiptoed in still earlier to look at\nher strange little daughter. She sometimes did that on Saturday mornings\nwhen she left early for the store and Fanny slept late. This morning\nFanny's black hair was spread over the pillow as she lay on her back,\none arm outflung, the other at her breast. She made a rather startlingly\nblack and white and scarlet picture as she lay there asleep. Fanny\ndid things very much in that way, too, with broad, vivid, unmistakable\nsplashes of color. Mrs. Brandeis, looking at the black-haired,\nred-lipped child sleeping there, wondered just how much determination\nlay back of the broad white brow. She had said little to Fanny about\nthis feat of fasting, and she told herself that she disapproved of it.\nBut in her heart she wanted the girl to see it through, once attempted.\n\nFanny awoke at half past seven, and her nostrils dilated to that most\nexquisite, tantalizing and fragrant of smells--the aroma of simmering\ncoffee. It permeated the house. It tickled the senses. It carried with\nit visions of hot, brown breakfast rolls, and eggs, and butter. Fanny\nloved her breakfast. She turned over now, and decided to go to sleep\nagain. But she could not. She got up and dressed slowly and carefully.\nThere was no one to hurry her this morning with the call from the foot\nof the stairs of, “Fanny! Your egg'll get cold!”\n\nShe put on clean, crisp underwear, and did her hair expertly. She\nslipped an all-enveloping pinafore over her head, that the new silk\ndress might not be crushed before church time. She thought that Theodore\nwould surely have finished his breakfast by this time. But when she came\ndown-stairs he was at the table. Not only that, he had just begun his\nbreakfast. An egg, all golden, and white, and crisply brown at the\nfrilly edges, lay on his plate. Theodore always ate his egg in a\nmathematical sort of way. He swallowed the white hastily first, because\nhe disliked it, and Mrs. Brandeis insisted that he eat it. Then he would\nbrood a moment over the yolk that lay, unmarred and complete, like an\namber jewel in the center of his plate. Then he would suddenly plunge\nhis fork into the very heart of the jewel, and it would flow over his\nplate, mingling with the butter, and he would catch it deftly with\nlittle mops of warm, crisp, buttery roll.\n\nFanny passed the breakfast table just as Theodore plunged his fork into\nthe egg yolk. She caught her breath sharply, and closed her eyes. Then\nshe turned and fled to the front porch and breathed deeply and windily\nof the heady September Wisconsin morning air. As she stood there, with\nher stiff, short black curls still damp and glistening, in her best\nshoes and stockings, with the all-enveloping apron covering her sturdy\nlittle figure, the light of struggle and renunciation in her face, she\ntypified something at once fine and earthy.\n\nBut the real struggle was to come later. They went to temple at ten,\nTheodore with his beloved violin tucked carefully under his arm. Bella\nWeinberg was waiting at the steps.\n\n“Did you?” she asked eagerly.\n\n“Of course not,” replied Fanny disdainfully. “Do you think I'd eat old\nbreakfast when I said I was going to fast all day?” Then, with sudden\nsuspicion, “Did you?”\n\n“No!” stoutly.\n\nAnd they entered, and took their seats. It was fascinating to watch the\nother members of the congregation come in, the women rustling, the men\nsubdued in the unaccustomed dignity of black on a week day. One glance\nat the yellow pews was like reading a complete social and financial\nregister. The seating arrangement of the temple was the Almanach de\nGotha of Congregation Emanu-el. Old Ben Reitman, patriarch among the\nJewish settlers of Winnebago, who had come over an immigrant youth, and\nwho now owned hundreds of rich farm acres, besides houses, mills and\nbanks, kinged it from the front seat of the center section. He was a\nmagnificent old man, with a ruddy face, and a fine head with a shock of\nheavy iron-gray hair, keen eyes, undimmed by years, and a startling and\nunexpected dimple in one cheek that gave him a mischievous and boyish\nlook.\n\nBehind this dignitary sat his sons, and their wives, and his daughters\nand their husbands, and their children, and so on, back to the Brandeis\npew, third from the last, behind which sat only a few obscure families\nbranded as Russians, as only the German-born Jew can brand those whose\nmisfortune it is to be born in that region known as hinter-Berlin.\n\nThe morning flew by, with its music, its responses, its sermon in\nGerman, full of four- and five-syllable German words like Barmherzigkeit\nand Eigentumlichkeit. All during the sermon Fanny sat and dreamed and\nwatched the shadow on the window of the pine tree that stood close to\nthe temple, and was vastly amused at the jaundiced look that the square\nof yellow window glass cast upon the face of the vain and overdressed\nMrs. Nathan Pereles. From time to time Bella would turn to bestow upon\nher a look intended to convey intense suffering and a resolute though\ndying condition. Fanny stonily ignored these mute messages. They\noffended something in her, though she could not tell what.\n\nAt the noon intermission she did not go home to the tempting dinner\nsmells, but wandered off through the little city park and down to the\nriver, where she sat on the bank and felt very virtuous, and spiritual,\nand hollow. She was back in her seat when the afternoon service was\nbegun. Some of the more devout members had remained to pray all through\nthe midday. The congregation came straggling in by twos and threes.\nMany of the women had exchanged the severely corseted discomfort of the\nmorning's splendor for the comparative ease of second-best silks.\nMrs. Brandeis, absent from her business throughout this holy day, came\nhurrying in at two, to look with a rather anxious eye upon her pale and\nresolute little daughter.\n\nThe memorial service was to begin shortly after three, and lasted almost\ntwo hours. At quarter to three Bella slipped out through the side aisle,\nbeckoning mysteriously and alluringly to Fanny as she went. Fanny looked\nat her mother.\n\n“Run along,” said Mrs. Brandeis. “The air will be good for you. Come\nback before the memorial service begins.” Fanny and Bella met, giggling,\nin the vestibule.\n\n“Come on over to my house for a minute,” Bella suggested. “I want\nto show you something.” The Weinberg house, a great, comfortable,\nwell-built home, with encircling veranda, and a well-cared-for lawn, was\njust a scant block away. They skipped across the street, down the block,\nand in at the back door. The big sunny kitchen was deserted. The house\nseemed very quiet and hushed. Over it hung the delicious fragrance of\nfreshly-baked pastry. Bella, a rather baleful look in her eyes, led the\nway to the butler's pantry that was as large as the average kitchen.\nAnd there, ranged on platters, and baking boards, and on snowy-white\nnapkins, was that which made Tantalus's feast seem a dry and barren\nsnack. The Weinberg's had baked. It is the custom in the household of\nAtonement Day fasters of the old school to begin the evening meal, after\nthe twenty-four hours of abstainment, with coffee and freshly-baked\ncoffee cake of every variety. It was a lead-pipe blow at one's\ndigestion, but delicious beyond imagining. Bella's mother was a famous\ncook, and her two maids followed in the ways of their mistress. There\nwere to be sisters and brothers and out-of-town relations as guests at\nthe evening meal, and Mrs. Weinberg had outdone herself.\n\n“Oh!” exclaimed Fanny in a sort of agony and delight.\n\n“Take some,” said Bella, the temptress.\n\nThe pantry was fragrant as a garden with spices, and fruit scents,\nand the melting, delectable perfume of brown, freshly-baked dough,\nsugar-coated. There was one giant platter devoted wholly to round, plump\ncakes, with puffy edges, in the center of each a sunken pool that was\nall plum, bearing on its bosom a snowy sifting of powdered sugar.\nThere were others whose centers were apricot, pure molten gold in\nthe sunlight. There were speckled expanses of cheese kuchen, the\ngolden-brown surface showing rich cracks through which one caught\nglimpses of the lemon-yellow cheese beneath--cottage cheese that had\nbeen beaten up with eggs, and spices, and sugar, and lemon. Flaky crust\nrose, jaggedly, above this plateau. There were cakes with jelly, and\ncinnamon kuchen, and cunning cakes with almond slices nestling side by\nside. And there was freshly-baked bread--twisted loaf, with poppy seed\nfreckling its braid, and its sides glistening with the butter that had\nbeen liberally swabbed on it before it had been thrust into the oven.\n\nFanny Brandeis gazed, hypnotized. As she gazed Bella selected a plum\ntart and bit into it--bit generously, so that her white little teeth met\nin the very middle of the oozing red-brown juice and one heard a little\nsquirt as they closed on the luscious fruit. At the sound Fanny quivered\nall through her plump and starved little body.\n\n“Have one,” said Bella generously. “Go on. Nobody'll ever know. Anyway,\nwe've fasted long enough for our age. I could fast till supper time if\nI wanted to, but I don't want to.” She swallowed the last morsel of\nthe plum tart, and selected another--apricot, this time, and opened her\nmoist red lips. But just before she bit into it (the Inquisition could\nhave used Bella's talents) she selected its counterpart and held it out\nto Fanny. Fanny shook her head slightly. Her hand came up involuntarily.\nHer eyes were fastened on Bella's face.\n\n“Go on,” urged Bella. “Take it. They're grand! M-m-m-m!” The first bite\nof apricot vanished between her rows of sharp white teeth. Fanny shut\nher eyes as if in pain. She was fighting the great fight of her life.\nShe was to meet other temptations, and perhaps more glittering ones, in\nher lifetime, but to her dying day she never forgot that first battle\nbetween the flesh and the spirit, there in the sugar-scented pantry--and\nthe spirit won. As Bella's lips closed upon the second bite of apricot\ntart, the while her eye roved over the almond cakes and her hand still\nheld the sweet out to Fanny, that young lady turned sharply, like a\nsoldier, and marched blindly out of the house, down the back steps,\nacross the street, and so into the temple.\n\nThe evening lights had just been turned on. The little congregation,\nrelaxed, weary, weak from hunger, many of them, sat rapt and still\nexcept at those times when the prayer book demanded spoken responses.\nThe voice of the little rabbi, rather weak now, had in it a timbre\nthat made it startlingly sweet and clear and resonant. Fanny slid very\nquietly into the seat beside Mrs. Brandeis, and slipped her moist\nand cold little hand into her mother's warm, work-roughened palm. The\nmother's brown eyes, very bright with unshed tears, left their perusal\nof the prayer book to dwell upon the white little face that was smiling\nrather wanly up at her. The pages of the prayer book lay two-thirds or\nmore to the left. Just as Fanny remarked this, there was a little moment\nof hush in the march of the day's long service. The memorial hour had\nbegun.\n\nLittle Doctor Thalmann cleared his throat. The congregation stirred a\nbit, changed its cramped position. Bella, the guilty, came stealing in,\na pink-and-gold picture of angelic virtue. Fanny, looking at her, felt\nvery aloof, and clean, and remote.\n\nMolly Brandeis seemed to sense what had happened.\n\n“But you didn't, did you?” she whispered softly.\n\nFanny shook her head.\n\nRabbi Thalmann was seated in his great carved chair. His eyes were\nclosed. The wheezy little organ in the choir loft at the rear of the\ntemple began the opening bars of Schumann's Traumerei. And then, above\nthe cracked voice of the organ, rose the clear, poignant wail of a\nviolin. Theodore Brandeis had begun to play. You know the playing of\nthe average boy of fifteen--that nerve-destroying, uninspired scraping.\nThere was nothing of this in the sounds that this boy called forth\nfrom the little wooden box and the stick with its taut lines of catgut.\nWhatever it was--the length of the thin, sensitive fingers, the turn of\nthe wrist, the articulation of the forearm, the something in the brain,\nor all these combined--Theodore Brandeis possessed that which makes for\ngreatness. You realized that as he crouched over his violin to get his\ncello tones. As he played to-day the little congregation sat very still,\nand each was thinking of his ambitions and his failures; of the lover\nlost, of the duty left undone, of the hope deferred; of the wrong that\nwas never righted; of the lost one whose memory spells remorse. It felt\nthe salt taste on its lips. It put up a furtive, shamed hand to dab at\nits cheeks, and saw that the one who sat in the pew just ahead was doing\nlikewise. This is what happened when this boy of fifteen wedded his bow\nto his violin. And he who makes us feel all this has that indefinable,\nmagic, glorious thing known as Genius.\n\nWhen it was over, there swept through the room that sigh following\ntension relieved. Rabbi Thalmann passed a hand over his tired eyes, like\none returning from a far mental journey; then rose, and came forward\nto the pulpit. He began, in Hebrew, the opening words of the memorial\nservice, and so on to the prayers in English, with their words of\ninfinite humility and wisdom.\n\n“Thou hast implanted in us the capacity for sin, but not sin itself!”\n\nFanny stirred. She had learned that a brief half hour ago. The service\nmarched on, a moving and harrowing thing. The amens rolled out with a\nnew fervor from the listeners. There seemed nothing comic now in the way\nold Ben Reitman, with his slower eyes, always came out five words behind\nthe rest who tumbled upon the responses and scurried briskly through\nthem, so that his fine old voice, somewhat hoarse and quavering now,\nrolled out its “Amen!” in solitary majesty. They came to that gem of\nhumility, the mourners' prayer; the ancient and ever-solemn Kaddish\nprayer. There is nothing in the written language that, for sheer drama\nand magnificence, can equal it as it is chanted in the Hebrew.\n\nAs Rabbi Thalmann began to intone it in its monotonous repetition of\npraise, there arose certain black-robed figures from their places and\nstood with heads bowed over their prayer books. These were members of\nthe congregation from whom death had taken a toll during the past year.\nFanny rose with her mother and Theodore, who had left the choir loft to\njoin them. The little wheezy organ played very softly. The black-robed\nfigures swayed. Here and there a half-stifled sob rose, and was crushed.\nFanny felt a hot haze that blurred her vision. She winked it away, and\nanother burned in its place. Her shoulders shook with a sob. She felt\nher mother's hand close over her own that held one side of the book.\nThe prayer, that was not of mourning but of praise, ended with a final\ncrescendo from the organ, The silent black-robed figures were seated.\n\nOver the little, spent congregation hung a glorious atmosphere of\ndetachment. These Jews, listening to the words that had come from the\nlips of the prophets in Israel, had been, on this day, thrown back\nthousands of years, to the time when the destruction of the temple was\nas real as the shattered spires and dome of the cathedral at Rheims.\nOld Ben Reitman, faint with fasting, was far removed from his everyday\nthoughts of his horses, his lumber mills, his farms, his mortgages. Even\nMrs. Nathan Pereles, in her black satin and bugles and jets, her\ncold, hard face usually unlighted by sympathy or love, seemed to feel\nsomething of this emotional wave. Fanny Brandeis was shaken by it. Her\nhead ached (that was hunger) and her hands were icy. The little Russian\ngirl in the seat just behind them had ceased to wriggle and squirm, and\nslept against her mother's side. Rabbi Thalmann, there on the platform,\nseemed somehow very far away and vague. The scent of clove apples and\nammonia salts filled the air. The atmosphere seemed strangely wavering\nand luminous. The white satin of the Ark curtain gleamed and shifted.\n\nThe long service swept on to its close. Suddenly organ and choir burst\ninto a paeon. Little Doctor Thalmann raised his arms. The congregation\nswept to its feet with a mighty surge. Fanny rose with them, her face\nvery white in its frame of black curls, her eyes luminous. She raised\nher face for the words of the ancient benediction that rolled, in its\nsimplicity and grandeur, from the lips of the rabbi:\n\n“May the blessing of the Lord our God rest upon you all. God bless thee\nand keep thee. May God cause His countenance to shine upon thee and be\ngracious unto thee. May God lift up His countenance unto thee, and grant\nthee peace.”\n\nThe Day of Atonement had come to an end. It was a very quiet, subdued\nand spent little flock that dispersed to their homes. Fanny walked out\nwith scarcely a thought of Bella. She felt, vaguely, that she and this\nschool friend were formed of different stuff. She knew that the bond\nbetween them had been the grubby, physical one of childhood, and that\nthey never would come together in the finer relation of the spirit,\nthough she could not have put this new knowledge into words.\n\nMolly Brandeis put a hand on her daughter's shoulder.\n\n“Tired, Fanchen?”\n\n“A little.”\n\n“Bet you're hungry!” from Theodore.\n\n“I was, but I'm not now.”\n\n“M-m-m--wait! Noodle soup. And chicken!”\n\nShe had intended to tell of the trial in the Weinberg's pantry. But now\nsomething within her--something fine, born of this day--kept her from\nit. But Molly Brandeis, to whom two and two often made five, guessed\nsomething of what had happened. She had felt a great surge of pride, had\nMolly Brandeis, when her son had swayed the congregation with the magic\nof his music. She had kissed him good night with infinite tenderness and\nlove. But she came into her daughter's tiny room after Fanny had gone to\nbed, and leaned over, and put a cool hand on the hot forehead.\n\n“Do you feel all right, my darling?”\n\n“Umhmph,” replied Fanny drowsily.\n\n“Fanchen, doesn't it make you feel happy and clean to know that you were\nable to do the thing you started out to do?”\n\n“Umhmph.”\n\n“Only,” Molly Brandeis was thinking aloud now, quite forgetting that\nshe was talking to a very little girl, “only, life seems to take\nsuch special delight in offering temptation to those who are able to\nwithstand it. I don't know why that's true, but it is. I hope--oh, my\nlittle girl, my baby--I hope----”\n\nBut Fanny never knew whether her mother finished that sentence or not.\nShe remembered waiting for the end of it, to learn what it was her\nmother hoped. And she had felt a sudden, scalding drop on her hand where\nher mother bent over her. And the next thing she knew it was morning,\nwith mellow September sunshine.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nIt was the week following this feat of fasting that two things happened\nto Fanny Brandeis--two seemingly unimportant and childish things--that\nwere to affect the whole tenor of her life. It is pleasant to\npredict thus. It gives a certain weight to a story and a sense of\ninevitableness. It should insure, too, the readers's support to the\npoint, at least, where the prediction is fulfilled. Sometimes a careless\nauthor loses sight altogether of his promise, and then the tricked\nreader is likely to go on to the very final page, teased by the\nexpectation that that which was hinted at will be revealed.\n\nFanny Brandeis had a way of going to the public library on Saturday\nafternoons (with a bag of very sticky peanut candy in her pocket, the\nlittle sensualist!) and there, huddled in a chair, dreamily and almost\nautomatically munching peanut brittle, her cheeks growing redder and\nredder in the close air of the ill-ventilated room, she would read,\nand read, and read. There was no one to censor her reading, so she\nread promiscuously, wading gloriously through trash and classic and\nhistorical and hysterical alike, and finding something of interest in\nthem all.\n\nShe read the sprightly “Duchess” novels, where mad offers of marriage\nwere always made in flower-scented conservatories; she read Dickens, and\nThelma, and old bound Cosmopolitans, and Zola, and de Maupassant, and\nthe “Wide, Wide World,” and “Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates,”\n and “Jane Eyre.” All of which are merely mentioned as examples of her\ncatholicism in literature. As she read she was unaware of the giggling\nboys and girls who came in noisily, and made dates, and were coldly\nfrowned on by the austere Miss Perkins, the librarian. She would read\nuntil the fading light would remind her that the short fall or winter\nday was drawing to a close.\n\nShe would come, shivering a little after the fetid atmosphere of\nthe overheated library, into the crisp, cold snap of the astringent\nWisconsin air. Sometimes she would stop at the store for her mother.\nSometimes she would run home alone through the twilight, her heels\nscrunching the snow, her whole being filled with a vague and unchildish\nsadness and disquiet as she faced the tender rose, and orange, and\nmauve, and pale lemon of the winter sunset. There were times when her\nvery heart ached with the beauty of that color-flooded sky; there were\ntimes, later, when it ached in much the same way at the look in the eyes\nof a pushcart peddler; there were times when it ached, seemingly, for no\nreason at all--as is sometimes the case when one is a little Jew girl,\nwith whole centuries of suffering behind one.\n\nOn this day she had taken a book from the library Miss Perkins, at sight\nof the title, had glared disapprovingly, and had hesitated a moment\nbefore stamping the card.\n\n“Is this for yourself?” she had asked.\n\n“Yes'm.”\n\n“It isn't a book for little girls,” snapped Miss Perkins.\n\n“I've read half of it already,” Fanny informed her sweetly. And went out\nwith it under her arm. It was Zola's “The Ladies' Paradise” (Au Bonheur\ndes Dames). The story of the shop girl, and the crushing of the little\ndealer by the great and moneyed company had thrilled and fascinated her.\n\nHer mind was full of it as she turned the corner on Norris Street and\nran full-tilt, into a yowling, taunting, torturing little pack of boys.\nThey were gathered in close formation about some object which they were\nteasing, and knocking about in the mud, and otherwise abusing with the\nsavagery of their years. Fanny, the fiery, stopped short. She pushed\ninto the ring. The object of their efforts was a weak-kneed and\nhollow-chested little boy who could not fight because he was cowardly\nas well as weak, and his name (oh, pity!) was Clarence--Clarence Heyl.\nThere are few things that a mischievous group of small boys cannot\ndo with a name like Clarence. They whined it, they catcalled it,\nthey shrieked it in falsetto imitation of Clarence's mother. He was a\nwide-mouthed, sallow and pindling little boy, whose pipe-stemmed legs\nlooked all the thinner for being contrasted with his feet, which were\nlong and narrow. At that time he wore spectacles, too, to correct a\nmuscular weakness, so that his one good feature--great soft, liquid\neyes--passed unnoticed. He was the kind of little boy whose mother\ninsists on dressing him in cloth-top, buttoned, patent-leather shoes for\nschool. His blue serge suit was never patched or shiny. His stockings\nwere virgin at the knee. He wore an overcoat on cool autumn days. Fanny\ndespised and pitied him. We ask you not to, because in this puny, shy\nand ugly little boy of fifteen you behold Our Hero.\n\nHe staggered to his feet now, as Fanny came up. His school reefer was\nmud-bespattered. His stockings were torn. His cap was gone and his hair\nwas wild. There was a cut or scratch on one cheek, from which the blood\nflowed.\n\n“I'll tell my mother on you!” he screamed impotently, and shook with\nrage and terror. “You'll see, you will! You let me alone, now!”\n\nFanny felt a sick sensation at the pit of her stomach and in her throat.\nThen:\n\n“He'll tell his ma!” sneered the boys in chorus. “Oh, mamma!” And called\nhim the Name. And at that a she wildcat broke loose among them. She\npounced on them without warning, a little fury of blazing eyes and\nflying hair, and white teeth showing in a snarl. If she had fought\nfair, or if she had not taken them so by surprise, she would have been\npowerless among them. But she had sprung at them with the suddenness\nof rage. She kicked, and scratched, and bit, and clawed and spat. She\nseemed not to feel the defensive blows that were showered upon her in\nturn. Her own hard little fists were now doubled for a thump or opened,\nlike a claw, for scratching.\n\n“Go on home!” she yelled to Clarence, even while she fought. And\nClarence, gathering up his tattered school books, went, and stood not on\nthe order of his going. Whereupon Fanny darted nimbly to one side, out\nof the way of boyish brown fists. In that moment she was transformed\nfrom a raging fury into a very meek and trembling little girl, who\nlooked shyly and pleadingly out from a tangle of curls. The boys were\nfor rushing at her again.\n\n“Cowardy-cats! Five of you fighting one girl,” cried Fanny, her lower\nlip trembling ever so little. “Come on! Hit me! Afraid to fight anything\nbut girls! Cowardy-cats!” A tear, pearly, pathetic, coursed down her\ncheek.\n\nThe drive was broken. Five sullen little boys stood and glared at her,\nimpotently.\n\n“You hit us first,” declared one boy. “What business d' you have\nscratching around like that, I'd like to know! You old scratch cat!”\n\n“He's sickly,” said Fanny. “He can't fight. There's something the matter\nwith his lungs, or something, and they're going to make him quit school.\nBesides, he's a billion times better than any of you, anyway.”\n\nAt once, “Fanny's stuck on Clar-ence! Fanny's stuck on Clar-ence!”\n\nFanny picked up her somewhat battered Zola from where it had flown at\nher first onslaught. “It's a lie!” she shouted. And fled, followed by\nthe hateful chant.\n\nShe came in at the back door, trying to look casual. But Mattie's keen\neye detected the marks of battle, even while her knife turned the frying\npotatoes.\n\n“Fanny Brandeis! Look at your sweater! And your hair!”\n\nFanny glanced down at the torn pocket dangling untidily. “Oh, that!” she\nsaid airily. And, passing the kitchen table, deftly filched a slice of\ncold veal from the platter, and mounted the back stairs to her room. It\nwas a hungry business, this fighting. When Mrs. Brandeis came in at six\nher small daughter was demurely reading. At supper time Mrs. Brandeis\nlooked up at her daughter with a sharp exclamation.\n\n“Fanny! There's a scratch on your cheek from your eye to your chin.”\n\nFanny put up her hand. “Is there?”\n\n“Why, you must have felt it. How did you get it?”\n\nFanny said nothing. “I'll bet she was fighting,” said Theodore with the\nintuitive knowledge that one child has of another's ways.\n\n“Fanny!” The keen brown eyes were upon her. “Some boys were picking on\nClarence Heyl, and it made me mad. They called him names.”\n\n“What names?”\n\n“Oh, names.”\n\n“Fanny dear, if you're going to fight every time you hear that name----”\n\nFanny thought of the torn sweater, the battered Zola, the scratched\ncheek. “It is pretty expensive,” she said reflectively.\n\nAfter supper she settled down at once to her book. Theodore would labor\nover his algebra after the dining-room table was cleared. He stuck his\ncap on his head now, and slammed out of the door for a half-hour's play\nunder the corner arc-light. Fanny rarely brought books from school, and\nyet she seemed to get on rather brilliantly, especially in the studies\nshe liked. During that winter following her husband's death Mrs.\nBrandeis had a way of playing solitaire after supper; one of the\nsimpler forms of the game. It seemed to help her to think out the day's\nproblems, and to soothe her at the same time. She would turn down the\nfront of the writing desk, and draw up the piano stool.\n\nAll through that winter Fanny seemed to remember reading to the\nslap-slap of cards, and the whir of their shuffling. In after years she\nwas never able to pick up a volume of Dickens without having her mind\nhark back to those long, quiet evenings. She read a great deal of\nDickens at that time. She had a fine contempt for his sentiment, and his\ngreat ladies bored her. She did not know that this was because they were\nbadly drawn. The humor she loved, and she read and reread the passages\ndealing with Samuel Weller, and Mr. Micawber, and Sairey Gamp, and Fanny\nSqueers. It was rather trying to read Dickens before supper, she had\ndiscovered. Pickwick Papers was fatal, she had found. It sent one to the\npantry in a sort of trance, to ransack for food--cookies, apples, cold\nmeat, anything. But whatever one found, it always fell short of the\nsucculent sounding beefsteak pies, and saddles of mutton, and hot\npineapple toddy of the printed page.\n\nTo-night Mrs. Brandeis, coming in from the kitchen after a conference\nwith Mattie, found her daughter in conversational mood, though book in\nhand.\n\n“Mother, did you ever read this?” She held up “The Ladies' Paradise.”\n\n“Yes; but child alive, what ever made you get it? That isn't the kind of\nthing for you to read. Oh, I wish I had more time to give----”\n\nFanny leaned forward eagerly. “It made me think a lot of you. You\nknow--the way the big store was crushing the little one, and everything.\nLike the thing you were talking to that man about the other day. You\nsaid it was killing the small-town dealer, and he said some day it would\nbe illegal, and you said you'd never live to see it.”\n\n“Oh, that! We were talking about the mail-order business, and how hard\nit was to compete with it, when the farmers bought everything from a\ncatalogue, and had whole boxes of household goods expressed to them. I\ndidn't know you were listening, Fanchen.”\n\n“I was. I almost always do when you and some traveling man or somebody\nlike that are talking. It--it's interesting.”\n\nFanny went back to her book then. But Molly Brandeis sat a moment,\neyeing her queer little daughter thoughtfully. Then she sighed, and laid\nout her cards for solitaire. By eight o'clock she was usually so sleepy\nthat she would fall, dead-tired, asleep on the worn leather couch in the\nsitting-room. She must have been fearfully exhausted, mind and body. The\nhouse would be very quiet, except for Mattie, perhaps, moving about in\nthe kitchen or in her corner room upstairs. Sometimes the weary woman\non the couch would start suddenly from her sleep and cry out, choked\nand gasping, “No! No! No!” The children would jump, terrified, and come\nrunning to her at first, but later they got used to it, and only looked\nup to say, when she asked them, bewildered, what it was that wakened\nher, “You had the no-no-nos.”\n\nShe had never told of the thing that made her start out of her sleep and\ncry out like that. Perhaps it was just the protest of the exhausted\nbody and the overwrought nerves. Usually, after that, she would sit\nup, haggardly, and take the hairpins out of her short thick hair, and\nannounce her intention of going to bed. She always insisted that the\nchildren go too, though they often won an extra half hour by protesting\nand teasing. It was a good thing for them, these nine o'clock bed hours,\nfor it gave them the tonic sleep that their young, high-strung natures\ndemanded.\n\n“Come, children,” she would say, yawning.\n\n“Oh, mother, please just let me finish this chapter!”\n\n“How much?”\n\n“Just this little bit. See? Just this.”\n\n“Well, just that, then,” for Mrs. Brandeis was a reasonable woman, and\nshe had the book-lover's knowledge of the fascination of the unfinished\nchapter.\n\nFanny and Theodore were not always honest about the bargain. They would\ngallop, hot-cheeked, through the allotted chapter. Mrs. Brandeis would\nhave fallen into a doze, perhaps. And the two conspirators would read\non, turning the leaves softly and swiftly, gulping the pages, cramming\nthem down in an orgy of mental bolting, like naughty children stuffing\ncake when their mother's back is turned. But the very concentration of\ntheir dread of waking her often brought about the feared result. Mrs.\nBrandeis would start up rather wildly, look about her, and see the two\nburied, red-cheeked and eager, in their books.\n\n“Fanny! Theodore! Come now! Not another minute!”\n\nFanny, shameless little glutton, would try it again. “Just to the end of\nthis chapter! Just this weenty bit!”\n\n“Fiddlesticks! You've read four chapters since I spoke to you the last\ntime. Come now!”\n\nMolly Brandeis would see to the doors, and the windows, and the clock,\nand then, waiting for the weary little figures to climb the stairs,\nwould turn out the light, and, hairpins in one hand, corset in the\nother, perhaps, mount to bed.\n\nBy nine o'clock the little household would be sleeping, the children\nsweetly and dreamlessly, the tired woman restlessly and fitfully, her\noverwrought brain still surging with the day's problems. It was not like\na household at rest, somehow. It was like a spirited thing standing,\nquivering for a moment, its nerves tense, its muscles twitching.\n\nPerhaps you have quite forgotten that here were to be retailed two\nepochal events in Fanny Brandeis's life. If you have remembered, you\nwill have guessed that the one was the reading of that book of social\nprotest, though its writer has fallen into disfavor in these fickle\ndays. The other was the wild and unladylike street brawl in which she\ntook part so that a terrified and tortured little boy might escape his\ntormentors.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\nThere was no hard stock in Brandeis' Bazaar now. The packing-room was\nalways littered with straw and excelsior dug from hogsheads and great\ncrates. Aloysius lorded it over a small red-headed satellite who\ndisappeared inside barrels and dived head first into huge boxes,\ncoming up again with a lamp, or a doll, or a piece of glassware, like\na magician. Fanny, perched on an overturned box, used to watch him,\nfascinated, while he laboriously completed a water set, or a tea set.\nA preliminary dive would bring up the first of a half dozen related\npieces, each swathed in tissue paper. A deft twist on the part of\nthe attendant Aloysius would strip the paper wrappings and disclose\na ruby-tinted tumbler, perhaps. Another dive, and another, until six\ngleaming glasses stood revealed, like chicks without a hen mother. A\nfinal dip, much scratching and burrowing, during which armfuls of hay\nand excelsior were thrown out, and then the red-headed genie of the\nbarrel would emerge, flushed and triumphant, with the water pitcher\nitself, thus completing the happy family.\n\nAloysius, meanwhile, would regale her with one of those choice bits of\ngossip he had always about him, like a jewel concealed, and only to be\nbrought out for the appreciative. Mrs. Brandeis disapproved of store\ngossip, and frowned on Sadie and Pearl whenever she found them, their\nheads close together, their stifled shrieks testifying to his wit. There\nwere times when Molly Brandeis herself could not resist the spell of his\ntongue. No one knew where Aloysius got his information. He had news that\nWinnebago's two daily papers never could get, and wouldn't have dared to\nprint if they had.\n\n“Did you hear about Myrtle Krieger,” he would begin, “that's marryin'\nthe Hempel boy next month? The one in the bank. She's exhibiting her\ntrewsow at the Outagamie County Fair this week, for the handwork and\nembroid'ry prize. Ain't it brazen? They say the crowd's so thick around\nthe table that they had to take down the more pers'nal pieces. The first\nday of the fair the grand-stand was, you might say, empty, even when\nthey was pullin' off the trottin' races and the balloon ascension. It's\nfunny--ain't it?--how them garmints that you wouldn't turn for a second\nlook at on the clothesline or in a store winda' becomes kind of wicked\nand interestin' the minute they get what they call the human note. There\nit lays, that virgin lawnjerie, for all the county to look at, with pink\nribbons run through everything, and the poor Krieger girl never dreamin'\nshe's doin' somethin' indelicate. She says yesterday if she wins the\nprize she's going to put it toward one of these kitchen cabinets.”\n\nI wish we could stop a while with Aloysius. He is well worth it.\nAloysius, who looked a pass between Ichabod Crane and Smike; Aloysius,\nwith his bit of scandal burnished with wit; who, after a long, hard\nSaturday, would go home to scrub the floor of the dingy lodgings where\nhe lived with his invalid mother, and who rose in the cold dawn of\nSunday morning to go to early mass, so that he might return to cook the\ndinner and wait upon the sick woman. Aloysius, whose trousers flapped\ngrotesquely about his bony legs, and whose thin red wrists hung\nawkwardly from his too-short sleeves, had in him that tender, faithful\nand courageous stuff of which unsung heroes are made. And he adored his\nclever, resourceful boss to the point of imitation. You should have seen\nhim trying to sell a sled or a doll's go-cart in her best style. But we\ncannot stop for Aloysius. He is irrelevant, and irrelevant matter halts\nthe progress of a story. Any one, from Barrie to Harold Bell Wright,\nwill tell you that a story, to be successful, must march.\n\nWe'll keep step, then, with Molly Brandeis until she drops out of the\nranks. There is no detouring with Mrs. Brandeis for a leader. She is the\nsort that, once her face is set toward her goal, looks neither to right\nnor left until she has reached it.\n\nWhen Fanny Brandeis was fourteen, and Theodore was not quite sixteen,\na tremendous thing happened. Schabelitz, the famous violinist, came to\nWinnebago to give a concert under the auspices of the Young Men's Sunday\nEvening Club.\n\nThe Young Men's Sunday Evening Club of the Congregational Church prided\nitself (and justifiably) on what the papers called its “auspices.” It\nscorned to present to Winnebago the usual lyceum attractions--Swiss bell\nringers, negro glee clubs, and Family Fours. Instead, Schumann-Heink\nsang her lieder for them; McCutcheon talked and cartooned for them;\nMadame Bloomfield-Zeisler played. Winnebago was one of those wealthy\nlittle Mid-Western towns whose people appreciate the best and set out to\nacquire it for themselves.\n\nTo the Easterner, Winnebago, and Oshkosh, and Kalamazoo, and Emporia are\nnames invented to get a laugh from a vaudeville audience. Yet it is the\npeople from Winnebago and Emporia and the like whom you meet in Egypt,\nand the Catalina Islands, and at Honolulu, and St. Moritz. It is in the\nWinnebago living-room that you are likely to find a prayer rug got in\nPersia, a bit of gorgeous glaze from China, a scarf from some temple in\nIndia, and on it a book, hand-tooled and rare. The Winnebagoans seem to\nknow what is being served and worn, from salad to veilings, surprisingly\nsoon after New York has informed itself on those subjects. The\n7:52 Northwestern morning train out of Winnebago was always pretty\ncomfortably crowded with shoppers who were taking a five-hour run down\nto Chicago to get a hat and see the new musical show at the Illinois.\n\nSo Schabelitz's coming was an event, but not an unprecedented one.\nExcept to Theodore. Theodore had a ticket for the concert (his mother\nhad seen to that), and he talked of nothing else. He was going with his\nviolin teacher, Emil Bauer. There were strange stories as to why Emil\nBauer, with his gift of teaching, should choose to bury himself in this\nobscure little Wisconsin town. It was known that he had acquaintance\nwith the great and famous of the musical world. The East End set fawned\nupon him, and his studio suppers were the exclusive social events in\nWinnebago.\n\nSchabelitz was to play in the evening. At half past three that afternoon\nthere entered Brandeis' Bazaar a white-faced, wide-eyed boy who was\nTheodore Brandeis; a plump, voluble, and excited person who was Emil\nBauer; and a short, stocky man who looked rather like a foreign-born\nartisan--plumber or steam-fitter--in his Sunday clothes. This was Levine\nSchabelitz.\n\nMolly Brandeis was selling a wash boiler to a fussy housewife who, in\nher anxiety to assure herself of the flawlessness of her purchase, had\ndone everything but climb inside it. It had early been instilled in the\nminds of Mrs. Brandeis's children that she was never to be approached\nwhen busy with a customer. There were times when they rushed into the\nstore bursting with news or plans, but they had learned to control\ntheir eagerness. This, though, was no ordinary news that had blanched\nTheodore's face. At sight of the three, Mrs. Brandeis quietly turned\nher boiler purchaser over to Pearl and came forward from the rear of the\nstore.\n\n“Oh, Mother!” cried Theodore, an hysterical note in his voice. “Oh,\nMother!”\n\nAnd in that moment Molly Brandeis knew. Emil Bauer introduced them,\nfloridly. Molly Brandeis held out her hand, and her keen brown eyes\nlooked straight and long into the gifted Russian's pale blue ones.\nAccording to all rules he should have started a dramatic speech,\nbeginning with “Madame!” hand on heart. But Schabelitz the great had\nsprung from Schabelitz the peasant boy, and in the process he had\nmanaged, somehow, to retain the simplicity which was his charm. Still,\nthere was something queer and foreign in the way he bent over Mrs.\nBrandeis's hand. We do not bow like that in Winnebago.\n\n“Mrs. Brandeis, I am honored to meet you.”\n\n“And I to meet you,” replied the shopkeeper in the black sateen apron.\n\n“I have just had the pleasure of hearing your son play,” began\nSchabelitz.\n\n“Mr. Bauer called me out of my economics class at school, Mother, and\nsaid that----”\n\n“Theodore!” Theodore subsided. “He is only a boy,” went on Schabelitz,\nand put one hand on Theodore's shoulder. “A very gifted boy. I hear\nhundreds. Oh, how I suffer, sometimes, to listen to their devilish\nscraping! To-day, my friend Bauer met me with that old plea, `You must\nhear this pupil play. He has genius.' `Bah! Genius!' I said, and I swore\nat him a little, for he is my friend, Bauer. But I went with him to his\nstudio--Bauer, that is a remarkably fine place you have there, above\nthat drug store; a room of exceptional proportions. And those rugs, let\nme tell you----”\n\n“Never mind the rugs, Schabelitz. Mrs. Brandeis here----”\n\n“Oh, yes, yes! Well, dear lady, this boy of yours will be a great\nviolinist if he is willing to work, and work, and work. He has what you\nin America call the spark. To make it a flame he must work, always work.\nYou must send him to Dresden, under Auer.”\n\n“Dresden!” echoed Molly Brandeis faintly, and put one hand on the table\nthat held the fancy cups and saucers, and they jingled a little.\n\n“A year, perhaps, first, in New York with Wolfsohn.”\n\nWolfsohn! New York! Dresden! It was too much even for Molly Brandeis'\nwell-balanced brain. She was conscious of feeling a little dizzy. At\nthat moment Pearl approached apologetically. “Pardon me, Mis' Brandeis,\nbut Mrs. Trost wants to know if you'll send the boiler special this\nafternoon. She wants it for the washing early to-morrow morning.”\n\nThat served to steady her.\n\n“Tell Mrs. Trost I'll send it before six to-night.” Her eyes rested on\nTheodore's face, flushed now, and glowing. Then she turned and faced\nSchabelitz squarely. “Perhaps you do not know that this store is our\nsupport. I earn a living here for myself and my two children. You see\nwhat it is--just a novelty and notion store in a country town. I speak\nof this because it is the important thing. I have known for a long\ntime that Theodore's playing was not the playing of the average boy,\nmusically gifted. So what you tell me does not altogether surprise me.\nBut when you say Dresden--well, from Brandeis' Bazaar in Winnebago,\nWisconsin, to Auer, in Dresden, Germany, is a long journey for one\nafternoon.”\n\n“But of course you must have time to think it over. It must be brought\nabout, somehow.”\n\n“Somehow----” Mrs. Brandeis stared straight ahead, and you could almost\nhear that indomitable will of hers working, crashing over obstacles,\nplowing through difficulties. Theodore watched her, breathless, as\nthough expecting an immediate solution. His mother's eyes met his own\nintent ones, and at that her mobile mouth quirked in a sudden smile.\n“You look as if you expected pearls to pop out of my mouth, son. And,\nby the way, if you're going to a concert this evening don't you think\nit would be a good idea to squander an hour on study this afternoon? You\nmay be a musical prodigy, but geometry's geometry.”\n\n“Oh, Mother! Please!”\n\n“I want to talk to Mr. Schabelitz and Mr. Bauer, alone.” She patted his\nshoulder, and the last pat ended in a gentle push. “Run along.”\n\n“I'll work, Mother. You know perfectly well I'll work.” But he looked\nso startlingly like his father as he said it that Mrs. Brandeis felt a\nclutching at her heart.\n\nTheodore out of the way, they seemed to find very little to discuss,\nafter all. Schabelitz was so quietly certain, Bauer so triumphantly\nproud.\n\nSaid Schabelitz, “Wolfsohn, of course, receives ten dollars a lesson\nordinarily.”\n\n“Ten dollars!”\n\n“But a pupil like Theodore is in the nature of an investment,” Bauer\nhastened to explain. “An advertisement. After hearing him play, and\nafter what Schabelitz here will have to say for him, Wolfsohn will\ncertainly give Theodore lessons for nothing, or next to nothing. You\nremember”--proudly--“I offered to teach him without charge, but you\nwould not have it.”\n\nSchabelitz smote his friend sharply on the shoulder “The true musician!\nOh, Bauer, Bauer! That you should bury yourself in this----”\n\nBut Bauer stopped him with a gesture. “Mrs. Brandeis is a busy woman.\nAnd as she says, this thing needs thinking over.”\n\n“After all,” said Mrs. Brandeis, “there isn't much to think about. I\nknow just where I stand. It's a case of mathematics, that's all. This\nbusiness of mine is just beginning to pay. From now on I shall be able\nto save something every year. It might be enough to cover his musical\neducation. It would mean that Fanny--my daughter--and I would have to\ngive up everything. For myself, I should be only too happy, too proud.\nBut it doesn't seem fair to her. After all, a girl----”\n\n“It isn't fair,” broke in Schabelitz. “It isn't fair. But that is the\nway of genius. It never is fair. It takes, and takes, and takes. I know.\nMy mother could tell you, if she were alive. She sold the little farm,\nand my sisters gave up their dowries, and with them their hopes of\nmarriage, and they lived on bread and cabbage. That was not to pay for\nmy lessons. They never could have done that. It was only to send me to\nMoscow. We were very poor. They must have starved. I have come to know,\nsince, that it was not worth it. That nothing could be worth it.”\n\n“But it was worth it. Your mother would do it all over again, if she had\nthe chance. That's what we're for.”\n\nBauer pulled out his watch and uttered a horrified exclamation. “Himmel!\nFour o'clock! And I have a pupil at four.” He turned hastily to Mrs.\nBrandeis. “I am giving a little supper in my studio after the concert\nto-night.”\n\n“Oh, Gott!” groaned Schabelitz.\n\n“It is in honor of Schabelitz here. You see how overcome he is. Will you\nlet me bring Theodore back with me after the concert? There will be some\nmusic, and perhaps he will play for us.”\n\nSchabelitz bent again in his queer little foreign bow. “And you, of\ncourse, will honor us, Mrs. Brandeis.” He had never lived in Winnebago.\n\n“Oh, certainly,” Bauer hastened to say. He had.\n\n“I!” Molly Brandeis looked down at her apron, and stroked it with her\nfingers. Then she looked up with a little smile that was not so pleasant\nas her smile usually was. There had flashed across her quick mind a\npicture of Mrs. G. Manville Smith. Mrs. G. Manville Smith, in an evening\ngown whose decolletage was discussed from the Haley House to Gerretson's\ndepartment store next morning, was always a guest at Bauer's studio\naffairs. “Thank you, but it is impossible. And Theodore is only a\nschoolboy. Just now he needs, more than anything else in the world,\nnine hours of sleep every night. There will be plenty of time for studio\nsuppers later. When a boy's voice is changing, and he doesn't know what\nto do with his hands and feet, he is better off at home.”\n\n“God! These mothers!” exclaimed Schabelitz. “What do they not know!”\n\n“I suppose you are right.” Bauer was both rueful and relieved. It\nwould have been fine to show off Theodore as his pupil and Schabelitz's\nprotege. But Mrs. Brandeis? No, that would never do. “Well, I must go.\nWe will talk about this again, Mrs. Brandeis. In two weeks Schabelitz\nwill pass through Winnebago again on his way back to Chicago. Meanwhile\nhe will write Wolfsohn. I also. So! Come, Schabelitz!”\n\nHe turned to see that gentleman strolling off in the direction of the\nnotion counter behind which his expert eye had caught a glimpse of Sadie\nin her white shirtwaist and her trim skirt. Sadie always knew what they\nwere wearing on State Street, Chicago, half an hour after Mrs. Brandeis\nreturned from one of her buying trips. Shirtwaists had just come in, and\nwith them those neat leather belts with a buckle, and about the throat\nthey were wearing folds of white satin ribbon, smooth and high and\ntight, the two ends tied pertly at the back. Sadie would never be the\nsaleswoman that Pearl was, but her unfailing good nature and her cheery\nself-confidence made her an asset in the store. Besides, she was pretty.\nMrs. Brandeis knew the value of a pretty clerk.\n\nAt the approach of this stranger Sadie leaned coyly against the stocking\nrack and patted her paper sleevelets that were secured at wrist and\nelbow with elastic bands. Her method was sure death to traveling men.\nShe prepared now to try it on the world-famous virtuoso. The ease with\nwhich she succeeded surprised even Sadie, accustomed though she was to\nconquest.\n\n“Come, come, Schabelitz!” said Bauer again. “I must get along.”\n\n“Then go, my friend. Go along and make your preparations for that studio\nsupper. The only interesting woman in Winnebago--” he bowed to Mrs.\nBrandeis--“will not be there. I know them, these small-town society\nwomen, with their imitation city ways. And bony! Always! I am enjoying\nmyself. I shall stay here.”\n\nAnd he did stay. Sadie, talking it over afterward with Pearl and\nAloysius, put it thus:\n\n“They say he's the grandest violin player in the world. Not that I care\nmuch for the violin, myself. Kind of squeaky, I always think. But it\njust goes to show they're all alike. Ain't it the truth? I jollied him\njust like I did Sam Bloom, of Ganz & Pick, Novelties, an hour before. He\nlaughed just where Sam did. And they both handed me a line of talk about\nmy hair and eyes, only Sam said I was a doll, and this Schabelitz, or\nwhatever his name is, said I was as alluring as a Lorelei. I guess he\nthought he had me there, but I didn't go through the seventh reader for\nnothing. `If you think I'm flattered,' I said to him, `you're mistaken.\nShe was the mess who used to sit out on a rock with her back hair down,\ncombing away and singing like mad, and keeping an eye out for sailors up\nand down the river. If I had to work that hard to get some attention,'\nI said, `I'd give up the struggle, and settle down with a cat and a\nteakettle.' At that he just threw back his head and roared. And when\nMrs. Brandeis came up he said something about the wit of these American\nwomen. `Work is a great sharpener of wit--and wits,' Mrs. Brandeis said\nto him. `Pearl, did Aloysius send Eddie out with that boiler, special?'\nAnd she didn't pay any more attention to him, or make any more fuss\nover him, than she would to a traveler with a line of samples she wasn't\ninterested in. I guess that's why he had such a good time.”\n\nSadie was right. That was the reason. Fanny, coming into the store half\nan hour later, saw this man who had swayed thousands with his music,\ndown on his hands and knees in the toy section at the rear of Brandeis'\nBazaar. He and Sadie and Aloysius were winding up toy bears, and clowns,\nand engines, and carriages, and sending them madly racing across the\nfloor. Sometimes their careening career was threatened with disaster\nin the form of a clump of brooms or a stack of galvanized pails. But\nSchabelitz would scramble forward with a shout and rescue them just\nbefore the crash came, and set them deftly off again in the opposite\ndirection.\n\n“This I must have for my boy in New York.” He held up a miniature hook\nand ladder. “And this windmill that whirls so busily. My Leo is seven,\nand his head is full of engines, and motors, and things that run on\nwheels. He cares no more for music, the little savage, than the son of a\nbricklayer.”\n\n“Who is that man?” Fanny whispered, staring at him.\n\n“Levine Schabelitz.”\n\n“Schabelitz! Not the--”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“But he's playing on the floor like--like a little boy! And laughing!\nWhy, Mother, he's just like anybody else, only nicer.”\n\nIf Fanny had been more than fourteen her mother might have told her that\nall really great people are like that, finding joy in simple things. I\nthink that is the secret of their genius--the child in them that keeps\ntheir viewpoint fresh, and that makes us children again when we listen\nto them. It is the Schabelitzes of this world who can shout over a toy\nengine that would bore a Bauer to death.\n\nFanny stood looking at him thoughtfully. She knew all about him.\nTheodore's talk of the past week had accomplished that. Fanny knew that\nhere was a man who did one thing better than any one else in the world.\nShe thrilled to that thought. She adored the quality in people that\ncaused them to excel. Schabelitz had got hold of a jack-in-the-box, and\neach time the absurd head popped out, with its grin and its squawk, he\nlaughed like a boy. Fanny, standing behind the wrapping counter, and\nleaning on it with her elbows the better to see this great man, smiled\ntoo, as her flexible spirit and her mobile mind caught his mood. She did\nnot know she was smiling. Neither did she know why she suddenly frowned\nin the intensity of her concentration, reached up for one of the pencils\non the desk next the wrapping counter, and bent over the topmost sheet\nof yellow wrapping paper that lay spread out before her. Her tongue-tip\ncurled excitedly at one corner of her mouth. Her head was cocked to one\nside.\n\nShe was rapidly sketching a crude and startling likeness of Levine\nSchabelitz as he stood there with the ridiculous toy in his hand. It\nwas a trick she often amused herself with at school. She had drawn her\nschool-teacher one day as she had looked when gazing up into the eyes of\nthe visiting superintendent, who was a married man. Quite innocently\nand unconsciously she had caught the adoring look in the eyes of Miss\nMcCook, the teacher, and that lady, happening upon the sketch later, had\ndealt with Fanny in a manner seemingly unwarranted. In the same way it\nwas not only the exterior likeness of the man which she was catching\nnow--the pompadour that stood stiffly perpendicular like a brush; the\nsquare, yellow peasant teeth; the strong, slender hands and wrists; the\nstocky figure; the high cheek bones; the square-toed, foreign-looking\nshoes and the trousers too wide at the instep to have been cut by an\nAmerican tailor. She caught and transmitted to paper, in some uncanny\nway, the simplicity of the man who was grinning at the jack-in-the-box\nthat smirked back at him. Behind the veneer of poise and polish born of\nsuccess and adulation she had caught a glimpse of the Russian peasant\nboy delighted with the crude toy in his hand. And she put it down\neagerly, wetting her pencil between her lips, shading here, erasing\nthere.\n\nMrs. Brandeis, bustling up to the desk for a customer's change, and with\na fancy dish to be wrapped, in her hand, glanced over Fanny's shoulder.\nShe leaned closer. “Why, Fanny, you witch!”\n\nFanny gave a little crow of delight and tossed her head in a way that\nswitched her short curls back from where they had fallen over her\nshoulders. “It's like him, isn't it?”\n\n“It looks more like him than he does himself.” With which Molly Brandeis\nunconsciously defined the art of cartooning.\n\nFanny looked down at it, a smile curving her lips. Mrs. Brandeis, dish\nin hand, counted her change expertly from the till below the desk, and\nreached for the sheet of wrapping paper just beneath that on which Fanny\nhad made her drawing. At that moment Schabelitz, glancing up, saw her,\nand came forward, smiling, the jack-in-the-box still in his hand.\n\n“Dear lady, I hope I have not entirely disorganized your shop. I have\nhad a most glorious time. Would you believe it, this jack-in-the-box\nlooks exactly--but exactly--like my manager, Weber, when the box-office\nreceipts are good. He grins just--”\n\nAnd then his eye fell on the drawing that Fanny was trying to cover with\none brown paw. “Hello! What's this?” Then he looked at Fanny. Then he\ngrasped her wrist in his fingers of steel and looked at the sketch that\ngrinned back at him impishly. “Well, I'm damned!” exploded Schabelitz in\namusement, and surprise, and appreciation. And did not apologize. “And\nwho is this young lady with the sense of humor?”\n\n“This is my little girl, Fanny.”\n\nHe looked down at the rough sketch again, with its clean-cut satire, and\nup again at the little girl in the school coat and the faded red tam o'\nshanter, who was looking at him shyly, and defiantly, and provokingly,\nall at once.\n\n“Your little girl Fanny, h'm? The one who is to give up everything that\nthe boy Theodore may become a great violinist.” He bent again over the\ncrude, effective cartoon, then put a forefinger gently under the child's\nchin and tipped her glowing face up to the light. “I am not so sure now\nthat it will work. As for its being fair! Why, no! No!”\n\nFanny waited for her mother that evening, and they walked home together.\nTheir step and swing were very much alike, now that Fanny's legs were\ngrowing longer. She was at the backfisch age.\n\n“What did he mean, Mother, when he said that about Theodore being a\ngreat violinist, and its not being fair? What isn't fair? And how did he\nhappen to be in the store, anyway? He bought a heap of toys, didn't he?\nI suppose he's awfully rich.”\n\n“To-night, when Theodore's at the concert, I'll tell you what he meant,\nand all about it.”\n\n“I'd love to hear him play, wouldn't you? I'd just love to.”\n\nOver Molly Brandeis's face there came a curious look. “You could hear\nhim, Fanny, in Theodore's place. Theodore would have to stay home if I\ntold him to.”\n\nFanny's eyes and mouth grew round with horror. “Theodore stay home! Why\nMrs.--Molly--Brandeis!” Then she broke into a little relieved laugh.\n“But you're just fooling, of course.”\n\n“No, I'm not. If you really want to go I'll tell Theodore to give up his\nticket to his sister.”\n\n“Well, my goodness! I guess I'm not a pig. I wouldn't have Theodore stay\nhome, not for a million dollars.”\n\n“I knew you wouldn't,” said Molly Brandeis as they swung down Norris\nStreet. And she told Fanny briefly of what Schabelitz had said about\nTheodore.\n\nIt was typical of Theodore that he ate his usual supper that night. He\nmay have got his excitement vicariously from Fanny. She was thrilled\nenough for two. Her food lay almost untouched on her plate. She\nchattered incessantly. When Theodore began to eat his second baked apple\nwith cream, her outraged feelings voiced their protest.\n\n“But, Theodore, I don't see how you can!”\n\n“Can what?”\n\n“Eat like that. When you're going to hear him play. And after what he\nsaid, and everything.”\n\n“Well, is that any reason why I should starve to death?”\n\n“But I don't see how you can,” repeated Fanny helplessly, and looked\nat her mother. Mrs. Brandeis reached for the cream pitcher and poured\na little more cream over Theodore's baked apple. Even as she did it\nher eyes met Fanny's, and in them was a certain sly amusement, a\nlittle gleam of fun, a look that said, “Neither do I.” Fanny sat back,\nsatisfied. Here, at least, was some one who understood.\n\nAt half past seven Theodore, looking very brushed and sleek, went off to\nmeet Emil Bauer. Mrs. Brandeis had looked him over, and had said, “Your\nnails!” and sent him back to the bathroom, and she had resisted the\ndesire to kiss him because Theodore disliked demonstration. “He hated to\nbe pawed over,” was the way he put it. After he had gone, Mrs. Brandeis\nwent into the dining-room where Fanny was sitting. Mattie had cleared\nthe table, and Fanny was busy over a book and a tablet, by the light\nof the lamp that they always used for studying. It was one of the rare\noccasions when she had brought home a school lesson. It was arithmetic,\nand Fanny loathed arithmetic. She had no head for mathematics. The set\nof problems were eighth-grade horrors, in which A is digging a well 20\nfeet deep and 9 feet wide; or in which A and B are papering two rooms,\nor building two fences, or plastering a wall. If A does his room in 9\n1/2 days, the room being 12 feet high, 20 feet long, and 15 1/2 feet\nwide, how long will it take B to do a room 14 feet high, 11 3/4 feet,\netc.\n\nFanny hated the indefatigable A and B with a bitter personal hatred.\nAnd as for that occasional person named C, who complicated matters still\nmore--!\n\nSometimes Mrs. Brandeis helped to disentangle Fanny from the mazes of\nher wall paper problems, or dragged her up from the bottom of the well\nwhen it seemed that she was down there for eternity unless a friendly\nhand rescued her. As a rule she insisted that Fanny crack her own\nmathematical nuts. She said it was good mental training, not to speak\nof the moral side of it. But to-night she bent her quick mind upon the\nproblems that were puzzling her little daughter, and cleared them up in\nno time.\n\nWhen Fanny had folded her arithmetic papers neatly inside her book and\nleaned back with a relieved sigh Molly Brandeis bent forward in the\nlamplight and began to talk very soberly. Fanny, red-cheeked and\nbright-eyed from her recent mental struggles, listened interestedly,\nthen intently, then absorbedly. She attempted to interrupt, sometimes,\nwith an occasional, “But, Mother, how--” but Mrs. Brandeis shook her\nhead and went on. She told Fanny a few things about her early married\nlife--things that made Fanny look at her with new eyes. She had always\nthought of her mother as her mother, in the way a fourteen-year-old\ngirl does. It never occurred to her that this mother person, who was\nso capable, so confident, so worldly-wise, had once been a very young\nbride, with her life before her, and her hopes stepping high, and her\nlove keeping time with her hopes. Fanny heard, fascinated, the story\nof this girl who had married against the advice of her family and her\nfriends.\n\nMolly Brandeis talked curtly and briefly, and her very brevity and lack\nof embroidering details made the story stand out with stark realism. It\nwas such a story of courage, and pride, and indomitable will, and sheer\npluck as can only be found among the seemingly commonplace.\n\n“And so,” she finished, “I used to wonder, sometimes, whether it\nwas worth while to keep on, and what it was all for. And now I know.\nTheodore is going to make up for everything. Only we'll have to help\nhim, first. It's going to be hard on you, Fanchen. I'm talking to you as\nif you were eighteen, instead of fourteen. But I want you to understand.\nThat isn't fair to you either--my expecting you to understand. Only I\ndon't want you to hate me too much when you're a woman, and I'm gone,\nand you'll remember--”\n\n“Why, Mother, what in the world are you talking about? Hate you!”\n\n“For what I took from you to give to him, Fanny. You don't understand\nnow. Things must be made easy for Theodore. It will mean that you and\nI will have to scrimp and save. Not now and then, but all the time.\nIt will mean that we can't go to the theater, even occasionally, or to\nlectures, or concerts. It will mean that your clothes won't be as pretty\nor as new as the other girls' clothes. You'll sit on the front porch\nevenings, and watch them go by, and you'll want to go too.”\n\n“As if I cared.”\n\n“But you will care. I know. I know. It's easy enough to talk about\nsacrifice in a burst of feeling; but it's the everyday, shriveling grind\nthat's hard. You'll want clothes, and books, and beaux, and education,\nand you ought to have them. They're your right. You ought to have them!”\n Suddenly Molly Brandeis' arms were folded on the table, and her head\ncame down on her arms and she was crying, quietly, horribly, as a man\ncries. Fanny stared at her a moment in unbelief. She had not seen her\nmother cry since the day of Ferdinand Brandeis' death. She scrambled\nout of her chair and thrust her head down next her mother's, so that her\nhot, smooth cheek touched the wet, cold one. “Mother, don't! Don't Molly\ndearie. I can't bear it. I'm going to cry too. Do you think I care for\nold dresses and things? I should say not. It's going to be fun going\nwithout things. It'll be like having a secret or something. Now stop,\nand let's talk about it.”\n\nMolly Brandeis wiped her eyes, and sat up, and smiled. It was a watery\nand wavering smile, but it showed that she was mistress of herself\nagain.\n\n“No,” she said, “we just won't talk about it any more. I'm tired, that's\nwhat's the matter with me, and I haven't sense enough to know it. I'll\ntell you what. I'm going to put on my kimono, and you'll make some\nfudge. Will you? We'll have a party, all by ourselves, and if Mattie\nscolds about the milk to-morrow you just tell her I said you could. And\nI think there are some walnut meats in the third cocoa can on the shelf\nin the pantry. Use 'em all.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\nTheodore came home at twelve o'clock that night. He had gone to Bauer's\nstudio party after all. It was the first time he had deliberately\ndisobeyed his mother in a really big thing. Mrs. Brandeis and Fanny had\nnibbled fudge all evening (it had turned out deliciously velvety) and\nhad gone to bed at their usual time. At half past ten Mrs. Brandeis had\nwakened with the instinctive feeling that Theodore was not in the house.\nShe lay there, wide awake, staring into the darkness until eleven. Then\nshe got up and went into his room, though she knew he was not there.\nShe was not worried as to his whereabouts or his well-being. That same\ninstinctive feeling told her where he was. She was very angry, and a\nlittle terrified at the significance of his act. She went back to bed\nagain, and she felt the blood pounding in her head. Molly Brandeis had a\ntemper, and it was surging now, and beating against the barriers of her\nself-control.\n\nShe told herself, as she lay there, that she must deal with him coolly\nand firmly, though she wanted to spank him. The time for spankings was\npast. Some one was coming down the street with a quick, light step. She\nsat up in bed, listening. The steps passed the house, went on. A half\nhour passed. Some one turned the corner, whistling blithely. But, no, he\nwould not be whistling, she told herself. He would sneak in, quietly. It\nwas a little after twelve when she heard the front door open (Winnebago\nrarely locked its doors). She was surprised to feel her heart beating\nrapidly. He was trying to be quiet, and was making a great deal of\nnoise about it. His shoes and the squeaky fifth stair alone would have\nconvicted him. The imp of perversity in Molly Brandeis made her smile,\nangry as she was, at the thought of how furious he must be at that\nstair.\n\n“Theodore!” she called quietly, just as he was tip-toeing past her room.\n\n“Yeh.”\n\n“Come in here. And turn on the light.”\n\nHe switched on the light and stood there in the doorway. Molly Brandeis,\nsitting up in bed in the chilly room, with her covers about her, was\nconscious of a little sick feeling, not at what he had done, but that\na son of hers should ever wear the sullen, defiant, hang-dog look that\ndisfigured Theodore's face now.\n\n“Bauer's?”\n\nA pause. “Yes.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“I just stopped in there for a minute after the concert. I didn't mean\nto stay. And then Bauer introduced me around to everybody. And then they\nasked me to play, and--”\n\n“And you played badly.”\n\n“Well, I didn't have my own violin.”\n\n“No football game Saturday. And no pocket money this week. Go to bed.”\n\nHe went, breathing hard, and muttering a little under his breath. At\nbreakfast next morning Fanny plied him with questions and was furious at\nhis cool uncommunicativeness.\n\n“Was it wonderful, Theodore? Did he play--oh--like an angel?”\n\n“Played all right. Except the `Swan' thing. Maybe he thought it was too\neasy, or something, but I thought he murdered it. Pass the toast, unless\nyou want it all.”\n\n\nIt was not until the following autumn that Theodore went to New York.\nThe thing that had seemed so impossible was arranged. He was to live\nin Brooklyn with a distant cousin of Ferdinand Brandeis, on a business\nbasis, and he was to come into New York three times a week for his\nlessons. Mrs. Brandeis took him as far as Chicago, treated him to an\nextravagant dinner, put him on the train and with difficulty stifled the\nimpulse to tell all the other passengers in the car to look after her\nTheodore. He looked incredibly grown up and at ease in his new suit and\nthe hat that they had wisely bought in Chicago. She did not cry at all\n(in the train), and she kissed him only twice, and no man can ask more\nthan that of any mother.\n\nMolly Brandeis went back to Winnebago and the store with her shoulders a\nlittle more consciously squared, her jaw a little more firmly set. There\nwas something almost terrible about her concentrativeness. Together she\nand Fanny began a life of self-denial of which only a woman could be\ncapable. They saved in ways that only a woman's mind could devise; petty\nways, that included cream and ice, and clothes, and candy. It was rather\nfun at first. When that wore off it had become a habit. Mrs. Brandeis\nmade two resolutions regarding Fanny. One was that she should have at\nleast a high school education, and graduate. The other that she should\nhelp in the business of the store as little as possible. To the first\nFanny acceded gladly. To the second she objected.\n\n“But why? If you can work, why can't I? I could help you a lot on\nSaturdays and at Christmas time, and after school.”\n\n“I don't want you to,” Mrs. Brandeis had replied, almost fiercely. “I'm\ngiving my life to it. That's enough. I don't want you to know about\nbuying and selling. I don't want you to know a bill of lading from a\nsales slip when you see it. I don't want you to know whether f. o. b. is\na wireless signal or a branch of the Masons.” At which Fanny grinned. No\none appreciated her mother's humor more than she.\n\n“But I do know already. The other day when that fat man was selling you\nthose go-carts I heard him say. `F. o. b. Buffalo,' and I asked Aloysius\nwhat it meant and he told me.”\n\nIt was inevitable that Fanny Brandeis should come to know these things,\nfor the little household revolved about the store on Elm Street. By the\ntime she was eighteen and had graduated from the Winnebago high school,\nshe knew so many things that the average girl of eighteen did not know,\nand was ignorant of so many things that the average girl of eighteen did\nknow, that Winnebago was almost justified in thinking her queer. She\nhad had a joyous time at school, in spite of algebra and geometry and\nphysics. She took the part of the heroine in the senior class play given\nat the Winnebago opera house, and at the last rehearsal electrified\nthose present by announcing that if Albert Finkbein (who played the\ndashing Southern hero) didn't kiss her properly when the curtain went\ndown on the first act, just as he was going into battle, she'd rather he\ndidn't kiss her at all.\n\n“He just makes it ridiculous,” she protested. “He sort of gives a peck\ntwo inches from my nose, and then giggles. Everybody will laugh, and\nit'll spoil everything.”\n\nWith the rather startled elocution teacher backing her she rehearsed the\nbashful Albert in that kiss until she had achieved the effect of realism\nthat she thought the scene demanded. But when, on the school sleighing\nparties and hay rides the boy next her slipped a wooden and uncertain\narm about her waist while they all were singing “Jingle Bells, Jingle\nBells,” and “Good Night Ladies,” and “Merrily We Roll Along,” she sat\nup stiffly and unyieldingly until the arm, discouraged, withdrew to its\nnormal position. Which two instances are quoted as being of a piece with\nwhat Winnebago termed her queerness.\n\nNot that Fanny Brandeis went beauless through school. On the contrary,\nshe always had some one to carry her books, and to take her to the\nschool parties and home from the Friday night debating society meetings.\nHer first love affair turned out disastrously. She was twelve, and she\nchose as the object of her affections a bullet-headed boy named Simpson.\nOne morning, as the last bell rang and they were taking their seats,\nFanny passed his desk and gave his coarse and stubbly hair a tweak. It\nwas really a love tweak, and intended to be playful, but she probably\nput more fervor into it than she knew. It brought the tears of pain\nto his eyes, and he turned and called her the name at which she shrank\nback, horrified. Her shock and unbelief must have been stamped on her\nface, for the boy, still smarting, had snarled, “Ya-as, I mean it.”\n\nIt was strange how she remembered that incident years after she had\nforgotten important happenings in her life. Clarence Heyl, whose very\nexistence you will have failed to remember, used to hover about her\nuncertainly, always looking as if he would like to walk home with her,\nbut never summoning the courage to do it. They were graduated from the\ngrammar school together, and Clarence solemnly read a graduation essay\nentitled “Where is the Horse?” Automobiles were just beginning to\nflash plentifully up and down Elm Street. Clarence had always been\nwhat Winnebago termed sickly, in spite of his mother's noodle soup, and\ncoddling. He was sent West, to Colorado, or to a ranch in Wyoming, Fanny\nwas not quite sure which, perhaps because she was not interested. He had\ncome over one afternoon to bid her good-by, and had dangled about the\nfront porch until she went into the house and shut the door.\n\nWhen she was sixteen there was a blond German boy whose taciturnity\nattracted her volubility and vivacity. She mistook his stolidness for\ndepth, and it was a long time before she realized that his silence\nwas not due to the weight of his thoughts but to the fact that he\nhad nothing to say. In her last year at high school she found herself\nsingled out for the attentions of Harmon Kent, who was the Beau Nash\nof the Winnebago high school. His clothes were made by Schwartze, the\ntailor, when all the other boys of his age got theirs at the spring and\nfall sales of the Golden Eagle Clothing Store. It was always nip and\ntuck between his semester standings and his track team and football\npossibilities. The faculty refused to allow flunkers to take part in\nathletics.\n\nHe was one of those boys who have definite charm, and manner, and poise\nat seventeen, and who crib their exams off their cuffs. He was always at\nthe head of any social plans in the school, and at the dances he rushed\nabout wearing in his coat lapel a ribbon marked Floor Committee. The\nteachers all knew he was a bluff, but his engaging manner carried\nhim through. When he went away to the state university he made Fanny\nsolemnly promise to write; to come down to Madison for the football\ngames; to be sure to remember about the Junior prom. He wrote once--a\nbadly spelled scrawl--and she answered. But he was the sort of person\nwho must be present to be felt. He could not project his personality.\nWhen he came home for the Christmas holidays Fanny was helping in the\nstore. He dropped in one afternoon when she was selling whisky glasses\nto Mike Hearn of the Farmers' Rest Hotel.\n\nThey did not write at all during the following semester, and when he\ncame back for the long summer vacation they met on the street one day\nand exchanged a few rather forced pleasantries. It suddenly dawned on\nFanny that he was patronizing her much as the scion of an aristocratic\nline banters the housemaid whom he meets on the stairs. She bit an\nimaginary apron corner, and bobbed a curtsy right there on Elm Street,\nin front of the Courier office and walked off, leaving him staring.\nIt was shortly after this that she began a queer line of reading for\na girl--lives of Disraeli, Spinoza, Mendelssohn, Mozart--distinguished\nJews who had found their religion a handicap.\n\nThe year of her graduation she did a thing for which Winnebago felt\nitself justified in calling her different. Each member of the graduating\nclass was allowed to choose a theme for a thesis. Fanny Brandeis called\nhers “A Piece of Paper.” On Winnebago's Fox River were located a number\nof the largest and most important paper mills in the country. There were\nmills in which paper was made of wood fiber, and others in which paper\nwas made of rags. You could smell the sulphur as soon as you crossed the\nbridge that led to the Flats. Sometimes, when the wind was right, the\npungent odor of it spread all over the town. Strangers sniffed it and\nmade a wry face, but the natives liked it.\n\nThe mills themselves were great ugly brick buildings, their windows\nfestooned with dust webs. Some of them boasted high detached tower-like\nstructures where a secret acid process went on. In the early days the\nmills had employed many workers, but newly invented machinery had come\nto take the place of hand labor. The rag-rooms alone still employed\nhundreds of girls who picked, sorted, dusted over the great suction\nbins. The rooms in which they worked were gray with dust. They wore caps\nover their hair to protect it from the motes that you could see spinning\nand swirling in the watery sunlight that occasionally found its way\nthrough the gray-filmed window panes. It never seemed to occur to them\nthat the dust cap so carefully pulled down about their heads did not\nafford protection for their lungs. They were pale girls, the rag-room\ngirls, with a peculiarly gray-white pallor.\n\nFanny Brandeis had once been through the Winnebago Paper Company's mill\nand she had watched, fascinated, while a pair of soiled and greasy old\nblue overalls were dusted and cleaned, and put through this acid vat,\nand that acid tub, growing whiter and more pulpy with each process until\nit was fed into a great crushing roller that pressed the moisture out\nof it, flattened it to the proper thinness and spewed it out at last,\nmiraculously, in the form of rolls of crisp, white paper. On the first\nday of the Easter vacation Fanny Brandeis walked down to the office of\nthe Winnebago Paper Company's mill and applied at the superintendent's\noffice for a job. She got it. They were generally shorthanded in the\nrag-room. When Mrs. Brandeis heard of it there followed one of the few\nstormy scenes between mother and daughter.\n\n“Why did you do it?” demanded Mrs. Brandeis.\n\n“I had to, to get it right.”\n\n“Oh, don't be silly. You could have visited the mill a dozen times.”\n\nFanny twisted the fingers of her left hand in the fingers of her right\nas was her way when she was terribly in earnest, and rather excited.\n\n“But I don't want to write about the paper business as a process.”\n\n“Well, then, what do you want?”\n\n“I want to write about the overalls on some railroad engineer, perhaps;\nor the blue calico wrapper that belonged, maybe, to a scrub woman. And\nhow they came to be spotted, or faded, or torn, and finally all worn\nout. And how the rag man got them, and the mill, and how the girls\nsorted them. And the room in which they do it. And the bins. And the\nmachinery. Oh, it's the most fascinating, and--and sort of relentless\nmachinery. And the acid burns on the hands of the men at the vats. And\ntheir shoes. And then the paper, so white. And the way we tear it up,\nor crumple it, and throw it in the waste basket. Just a piece of paper,\ndon't you see what I mean? Just a piece of paper, and yet all that--”\n she stopped and frowned a little, and grew inarticulate, and gave it up\nwith a final, “Don't you see what I mean, Mother? Don't you see what I\nmean?”\n\nMolly Brandeis looked at her daughter in a startled way, like one who,\nwalking tranquilly along an accustomed path, finds himself confronting a\nnew and hitherto unsuspected vista, formed by a peculiar arrangement of\nclouds, perhaps, or light, or foliage, or all three blended. “I see\nwhat you mean,” she said. “But I wish you wouldn't do it. I--I wish you\ndidn't feel that you wanted to do it.”\n\n“But how can I make it real if I don't?”\n\n“You can't,” said Molly Brandeis. “That's just it. You can't, ever.”\n\nFanny got up before six every morning of that Easter vacation, and went\nto the mill, lunch box in hand. She came home at night dead-tired. She\ndid not take the street car to and from the mill, as she might have,\nbecause she said the other girls in the rag-room walked, some of them\nfrom the very edge of town. Mrs. Brandeis said that she was carrying\nthings too far, but Fanny stuck it out for the two weeks, at the end\nof which period she spent an entire Sunday in a hair-washing,\nface-steaming, and manicuring bee. She wrote her paper from notes she\nhad taken, and turned it in at the office of the high school principal\nwith the feeling that it was not at all what she had meant it to be. A\nweek later Professor Henning called her into his office. The essay lay\non his desk.\n\n“I've read your thesis,” he began, and stopped, and cleared his throat.\nHe was not an eloquent man. “Where did you get your information, Miss\nBrandeis?”\n\n“I got it at the mill.”\n\n“From one of the employees?”\n\n“Oh, no. I worked there, in the rag-room.”\n\nProfessor Henning gave a little startled exclamation that he turned\nhastily into a cough. “I thought that perhaps the editor of the Courier\nmight like to see it--it being local. And interesting.”\n\nHe brought it down to the office of the little paper himself, and\npromised to call for it again in an hour or two, when Lem Davis should\nhave read it. Lem Davis did read it, and snorted, and scuffled with his\nfeet in the drift of papers under his desk, which was a way he had when\nenraged.\n\n“Read it!” he echoed, at Professor Henning's question. “Read it! Yes, I\nread it. And let me tell you it's socialism of the rankest kind, that's\nwhat! It's anarchism, that's what! Who's this girl? Mrs. Brandeis's\ndaughter--of the Bazaar? Let me tell you I'd go over there and tell her\nwhat I think of the way she's bringing up that girl--if she wasn't an\nadvertiser. `A Piece of Paper'! Hell!” And to show his contempt for what\nhe had read he wadded together a great mass of exchanges that littered\nhis desk and hurled them, a crumpled heap, to the floor, and then spat\ntobacco juice upon them.\n\n“I'm sorry,” said Professor Henning, and rose; but at the door he turned\nand said something highly unprofessorial. “It's a darn fine piece\nof writing.” And slammed the door. At supper that night he told Mrs.\nHenning about it. Mrs. Henning was a practical woman, as the wife of a\nsmall-town high school principal must needs be. “But don't you know,”\n she said, “that Roscoe Moore, who is president of the Outagamie Pulp\nMill and the Winnebago Paper Company, practically owns the Courier?”\n\nProfessor Henning passed a hand over his hair, ruefully, like a school\nboy. “No, Martha, I didn't know. If I knew those things, dear, I suppose\nwe wouldn't be eating sausage for supper to-night.” There was a little\nsilence between them. Then he looked up. “Some day I'm going to brag\nabout having been that Brandeis girl's teacher.”\n\nFanny was in the store a great deal now. After she finished high school\nthey sent Mattie away and Fanny took over the housekeeping duties, but\nit was not her milieu. Not that she didn't do it well. She put a perfect\nfury of energy and care into the preparation of a pot roast. After she\nhad iced a cake she enhanced it with cunning arabesques of jelly. The\nhouse shone as it never had, even under Mattie's honest regime. But\nit was like hitching a high-power engine to a butter churn. There were\nperiods of maddening restlessness. At such times she would set\nabout cleaning the cellar, perhaps. It was a three-roomed cellar,\nbrick-floored, cool, and having about it that indefinable cellar smell\nwhich is of mold, and coal, and potatoes, and onions, and kindling wood,\nand dill pickles and ashes.\n\nOther girls of Fanny's age, at such times, cleaned out their bureau\ndrawers and read forbidden novels. Fanny armed herself with the third\nbest broom, the dust-pan, and an old bushel basket. She swept up chips,\nscraped up ashes, scoured the preserve shelves, washed the windows,\ncleaned the vegetable bins, and got gritty, and scarlet-cheeked and\nstreaked with soot. It was a wonderful safety valve, that cellar. A pity\nit was that the house had no attic.\n\nThen there were long, lazy summer afternoons when there was nothing to\ndo but read. And dream. And watch the town go by to supper. I think that\nis why our great men and women so often have sprung from small towns, or\nvillages. They have had time to dream in their adolescence. No cars\nto catch, no matinees, no city streets, none of the teeming, empty,\nenergy-consuming occupations of the city child. Little that is\ncompetitive, much that is unconsciously absorbed at the most\nimpressionable period, long evenings for reading, long afternoons in the\nfields or woods. With the cloth laid, and the bread cut and covered with\na napkin, and the sauce in the glass bowl, and the cookies on a blue\nplate, and the potatoes doing very, very slowly, and the kettle steaming\nwith a Peerybingle cheerfulness, Fanny would stroll out to the front\nporch again to watch for the familiar figure to appear around the corner\nof Norris Street. She would wear her blue-and-white checked gingham\napron deftly twisted over one hip, and tucked in, in deference to the\npassers-by. And the town would go by--Hen Cody's drays, rattling and\nthundering; the high school boys thudding down the road, dog-tired and\nsweaty in their football suits, or their track pants and jersies, on\ntheir way from the athletic field to the school shower baths; Mrs.\nMosher flying home, her skirts billowing behind her, after a protracted\nafternoon at whist; little Ernie Trost with a napkin-covered peach\nbasket carefully balanced in his hand, waiting for the six-fifteen\ninterurban to round the corner near the switch, so that he could hand up\nhis father's supper; Rudie Mass, the butcher, with a moist little packet\nof meat in his hand, and lurching ever so slightly, and looking about\ndefiantly. Oh, Fanny probably never realized how much she saw and\nabsorbed, sitting there on Brandeis' front porch, watching Winnebago go\nby to supper.\n\nAt Christmas time she helped in the store, afternoons and evenings.\nThen, one Christmas, Mrs. Brandeis was ill for three weeks with grippe.\nThey had to have a helper in the house. When Mrs. Brandeis was able to\ncome back to the store Sadie left to marry, not one of her traveling-men\nvictims, but a steady person, in the paper-hanging way, whose suit had\nlong been considered hopeless. After that Fanny took her place. She\ndeveloped a surprising knack at selling. Yet it was not so surprising,\nperhaps, when one considered her teacher. She learned as only a woman\ncan learn who is brought into daily contact with the outside world.\nIt was not only contact: it was the relation of buyer and seller. She\nlearned to judge people because she had to. How else could one gauge\ntheir tastes, temperaments, and pocketbooks? They passed in and out\nof Brandeis' Bazaar, day after day, in an endless and varied\nprocession--traveling men, school children, housewives, farmers, worried\nhostesses, newly married couples bent on house furnishing, business men.\n\nShe learned that it was the girls from the paper mills who bought\nthe expensive plates--the ones with the red roses and green leaves\nhand-painted in great smears and costing two dollars and a half, while\nthe golf club crowd selected for a gift or prize one of the little white\nplates with the faded-looking blue sprig pattern, costing thirty-nine\ncents. One day, after she had spent endless time and patience over the\nsale of a nondescript little plate to one of Winnebago's socially elect,\nshe stared wrathfully after the retreating back of the trying customer.\n\n“Did you see that? I spent an hour with her. One hour! I showed her\neverything from the imported Limoges bowls to the Sevres cups and\nsaucers, and all she bought was that miserable little bonbon dish with\nthe cornflower pattern. Cat!”\n\nMrs. Brandeis spoke from the depths of her wisdom.\n\n“Fanny, I didn't miss much that went on during that hour, and I was\ndying to come over and take her away from you, but I didn't because I\nknew you needed the lesson, and I knew that that McNulty woman never\nspends more than twenty-five cents, anyway. But I want to tell you now\nthat it isn't only a matter of plates. It's a matter of understanding\nfolks. When you've learned whom to show the expensive hand-painted\nthings to, and when to suggest quietly the little, vague things, with\nwhat you call the faded look, why, you've learned just about all there\nis to know of human nature. Don't expect it, at your age.”\n\nMolly Brandeis had never lost her trick of chatting with customers, or\nlistening to them, whenever she had a moment's time. People used to drop\nin, and perch themselves on one of the stools near the big glowing base\nburner and talk to Mrs. Brandeis. It was incredible, the secrets they\nrevealed of business, and love and disgrace; of hopes and aspirations,\nand troubles, and happiness. The farmer women used to fascinate Fanny\nby their very drabness. Mrs. Brandeis had a long and loyal following\nof these women. It was before the day when every farmhouse boasted an\nautomobile, a telephone, and a phonograph.\n\nA worn and dreary lot, these farmer women, living a skimmed milk\nexistence, putting their youth, and health, and looks into the soil.\nThey used often to sit back near the stove in winter, or in a cool\ncorner near the front of the store in summer, and reveal, bit by bit,\nthe sordid, tragic details of their starved existence. Fanny was often\nshocked when they told their age--twenty-five, twenty-eight, thirty,\nbut old and withered from drudgery, and child-bearing, and coarse,\nunwholesome food. Ignorant women, and terribly lonely, with the dumb,\nlack-luster eyes that bespeak monotony. When they smiled they showed\nblue-white, glassily perfect false teeth that flashed incongruously in\nthe ruin of their wrinkled, sallow, weather-beaten faces. Mrs. Brandeis\nwould question them gently.\n\nChildren? Ten. Living? Four. Doctor? Never had one in the house. Why? He\ndidn't believe in them. No proper kitchen utensils, none of the\ndevices that lighten the deadeningly monotonous drudgery of housework.\nEverything went to make his work easier--new harrows, plows, tractors,\nwind mills, reapers, barns, silos. The story would come out, bit by\nbit, as the woman sat there, a worn, unlovely figure, her\nhands--toil-blackened, seamed, calloused, unlovelier than any woman's\nhands were ever meant to be--lying in unaccustomed idleness in her lap.\n\nFanny learned, too, that the woman with the shawl, and with her money\ntied in a corner of her handkerchief, was more likely to buy the\nsix-dollar doll, with the blue satin dress, and the real hair and\neye-lashes, while the Winnebago East End society woman haggled over the\nforty-nine cent kind, which she dressed herself.\n\nI think their loyalty to Mrs. Brandeis might be explained by her honesty\nand her sympathy. She was so square with them. When Minnie Mahler, out\nCenterville way, got married, she knew there would be no redundancy of\nwater sets, hanging lamps, or pickle dishes.\n\n“I thought like I'd get her a chamber set,” Minnie's aunt would confide\nto Mrs. Brandeis.\n\n“Is this for Minnie Mahler, of Centerville?”\n\n“Yes; she gets married Sunday.”\n\n“I sold a chamber set for that wedding yesterday. And a set of dishes.\nBut I don't think she's got a parlor lamp. At least I haven't sold one.\nWhy don't you get her that? If she doesn't like it she can change it.\nNow there's that blue one with the pink roses.”\n\nAnd Minnie's aunt would end by buying the lamp.\n\nFanny learned that the mill girls liked the bright-colored and expensive\nwares, and why; she learned that the woman with the “fascinator” (tragic\nmisnomer!) over her head wanted the finest sled for her boy. She learned\nto keep her temper. She learned to suggest without seeming to suggest.\nShe learned to do surprisingly well all those things that her mother did\nso surprisingly well--surprisingly because both the women secretly hated\nthe business of buying and selling. Once, on the Fourth of July, when\nthere was a stand outside the store laden with all sorts of fireworks,\nFanny came down to find Aloysius and the boy Eddie absent on other work,\nand Mrs. Brandeis momentarily in charge. The sight sickened her, then\ninfuriated her.\n\n“Come in,” she said, between her teeth. “That isn't your work.”\n\n“Somebody had to be there. Pearl's at dinner. And Aloysius and Eddie\nwere--”\n\n“Then leave it alone. We're not starving--yet. I won't have you selling\nfireworks like that--on the street. I won't have it! I won't have it!”\n\nThe store was paying, now. Not magnificently, but well enough. Most of\nthe money went to Theodore, in Dresden. He was progressing, though not\nso meteorically as Bauer and Schabelitz had predicted. But that sort\nof thing took time, Mrs. Brandeis argued. Fanny often found her mother\nlooking at her these days with a questioning sadness in her eyes. Once\nshe suggested that Fanny join the class in drawing at the Winnebago\nuniversity--a small fresh-water college. Fanny did try it for a few\nmonths, but the work was not what she wanted; they did fruit pictures\nand vases, with a book, on a table; or a clump of very pink and very\nwhite flowers. Fanny quit in disgust and boredom. Besides, they were\nbusy at the store, and needed her.\n\nThere came often to Winnebago a woman whom Fanny Brandeis admired\nintensely. She was a traveling saleswoman, successful, magnetic, and\nvery much alive. Her name was Mrs. Emma McChesney, and between her and\nMrs. Brandeis there existed a warm friendship. She always took dinner\nwith Mrs. Brandeis and Fanny, and they made a special effort to give her\nall those delectable home-cooked dishes denied her in her endless round\nof hotels.\n\n“Noodle soup!” she used to say, almost lyrically.\n\n“With real hand-made, egg noodles! You don't know what it means. You\nhaven't been eating vermicelli soup all through Illinois and Wisconsin.”\n\n“We've made a dessert, though, that--”\n\n“Molly Brandeis, don't you dare to tell me what you've got for dessert.\nI couldn't stand it. But, oh, suppose, SUPPOSE it's homemade strawberry\nshortcake!”\n\nWhich it more than likely was.\n\nFanny Brandeis used to think that she would dress exactly as Mrs.\nMcChesney dressed, if she too were a successful business woman earning a\nman-size salary. Mrs. McChesney was a blue serge sort of woman--and her\nblue serge never was shiny in the back. Her collar, or jabot, or tie,\nor cuffs, or whatever relieving bit of white she wore, was always of the\nfreshest and crispest. Her hats were apt to be small and full of what is\nknown as “line.” She usually would try to arrange her schedule so as to\nspend a Sunday in Winnebago, and the three alert, humor-loving women,\ngrown wise and tolerant from much contact with human beings, would have\na delightful day together.\n\n“Molly,” Mrs. McChesney would say, when they were comfortably settled\nin the living-room, or on the front porch, “with your shrewdness,\nand experience, and brains, you ought to be one of those five or ten\nthousand a year buyers. You know how to sell goods and handle people.\nAnd you know values. That's all there is to the whole game of business.\nI don't advise you to go on the road. Heaven knows I wouldn't advise my\ndearest enemy to do that, much less a friend. But you could do bigger\nthings, and get bigger results. You know most of the big wholesalers,\nand retailers too. Why don't you speak to them about a department\nposition? Or let me nose around a bit for you.”\n\nMolly Brandeis shook her head, though her expressive eyes were eager\nand interested. “Don't you think I've thought of that, Emma? A thousand\ntimes? But I'm--I'm afraid. There's too much at stake. Suppose I\ncouldn't succeed? There's Theodore. His whole future is dependent on me\nfor the next few years. And there's Fanny here. No, I guess I'm too old.\nAnd I'm sure of the business here, small as it is.”\n\nEmma McChesney glanced at the girl. “I'm thinking that Fanny has the\nmaking of a pretty capable business woman herself.”\n\nFanny drew in her breath sharply, and her face sparkled into sudden\nlife, as always when she was tremendously interested.\n\n“Do you know what I'd do if I were in Mother's place? I'd take a great,\nbig running jump for it and land! I'd take a chance. What is there for\nher in this town? Nothing! She's been giving things up all her life, and\nwhat has it brought her?”\n\n“It has brought me a comfortable living, and the love of my two\nchildren, and the respect of my townspeople.”\n\n“Respect? Why shouldn't they respect you? You're the smartest woman in\nWinnebago, and the hardest working.”\n\nEmma McChesney frowned a little, in thought. “What do you two girls do\nfor recreation?”\n\n“I'm afraid we have too little of that, Emma. I know Fanny has. I'm so\ndog-tired at the end of the day. All I want is to take my hairpins out\nand go to bed.”\n\n“And Fanny?”\n\n“Oh, I read. I'm free to pick my book friends, at least.”\n\n“Now, just what do you mean by that, child? It sounds a little bitter.”\n\n“I was thinking of what Chesterfield said in one of his Letters to His\nSon. `Choose always to be in the society of those above you,' he wrote.\nI guess he lived in Winnebago, Wisconsin. I'm a working woman, and a\nJew, and we haven't any money or social position. And unless she's a\nBecky Sharp any small town girl with all those handicaps might as\nwell choose a certain constellation of stars in the sky to wear as a\nbreastpin, as try to choose the friends she really wants.”\n\nFrom Molly Brandeis to Emma McChesney there flashed a look that said,\n“You see?” And from Emma McChesney to Molly Brandeis another that said,\n“Yes; and it's your fault.”\n\n“Look here, Fanny, don't you see any boys--men?”\n\n“No. There aren't any. Those who have any sense and initiative leave\nto go to Milwaukee, or Chicago, or New York. Those that stay marry the\nbanker's lovely daughter.”\n\nEmma McChesney laughed at that, and Molly Brandeis too, and Fanny joined\nthem a bit ruefully. Then quite suddenly, there came into her face a\nmelting, softening look that made it almost lovely. She crossed swiftly\nover to where her mother sat, and put a hand on either cheek (grown\nthinner of late) and kissed the tip of her nose. “We don't care--really.\nDo we Mother? We're poor wurkin' girruls. But gosh! Ain't we proud?\nMother, your mistake was in not doing as Ruth did.”\n\n“Ruth?”\n\n“In the Bible. Remember when What's-his-name, her husband, died? Did\nshe go back to her home town? No, she didn't. She'd lived there all\nher life, and she knew better. She said to Naomi, her mother-in-law,\n`Whither thou goest I will go.' And she went. And when they got to\nBethlehem, Ruth looked around, knowingly, until she saw Boaz, the\ncatch of the town. So she went to work in his fields, gleaning, and\nshe gleaned away, trying to look just as girlish, and dreamy, and\nunconscious, but watching him out of the corner of her eye all the\ntime. Presently Boaz came along, looking over the crops, and he saw her.\n`Who's the new damsel?' he asked. `The peach?'”\n\n“Fanny Brandeis, aren't you ashamed?”\n\n“But, Mother, that's what it says in the Bible, actually. `Whose damsel\nis this?' They told him it was Ruth, the dashing widow. After that it\nwas all off with the Bethlehem girls. Boaz paid no more attention\nto them than if they had never existed. He married Ruth, and she led\nsociety. Just a little careful scheming, that's all.”\n\n“I should say you have been reading, Fanny Brandeis,” said Emma\nMcChesney. She was smiling, but her eyes were serious. “Now listen to\nme, child. The very next time a traveling man in a brown suit and a red\nnecktie asks you to take dinner with him at the Haley House--even one\nof those roast pork, queen-fritter-with-rum-sauce, Roman punch Sunday\ndinners--I want you to accept.”\n\n“Even if he wears an Elks' pin, and a Masonic charm, and a diamond ring\nand a brown derby?” “Even if he shows you the letters from his girl in\nManistee,” said Mrs. McChesney solemnly. “You've been seeing too much of\nFanny Brandeis.”\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\nTheodore had been gone six years. His letters, all too brief, were\nevents in the lives of the two women. They read and reread them. Fanny\nunconsciously embellished them with fascinating details made up out of\nher own imagination.\n\n“They're really triumphs of stupidity and dullness,” she said one day\nin disgust, after one of Theodore's long-awaited letters had proved\nparticularly dry and sparse. “Just think of it! Dresden, Munich,\nLeipsic, Vienna, Berlin, Frankfurt! And from his letters you would never\nknow he had left Winnebago. I don't believe he actually sees anything\nof these cities--their people, and the queer houses, and the streets.\nI suppose a new city means nothing to him but another platform, another\naudience, another piano, all intended as a background for his violin. He\ncould travel all over the world and it wouldn't touch him once. He's got\nhis mental fingers crossed all the time.”\n\nTheodore had begun to play in concert with some success, but he wrote\nthat there was no real money in it yet. He was not well enough known. It\ntook time. He would have to get a name in Europe before he could attempt\nan American tour. Just now every one was mad over Greinert. He was\ndrawing immense audiences. He sent them a photograph at which they\ngasped, and then laughed, surprisedly. He looked so awfully German, so\ndifferent, somehow.\n\n“It's the way his hair is clipped, I suppose,” said Fanny. “High, like\nthat, on the temples. And look at his clothes! That tie! And his pants!\nAnd that awful collar! Why, his very features look German, don't they? I\nsuppose it's the effect of that haberdashery.”\n\nA month after the photograph, came a letter announcing his marriage.\nFanny's quick eye, leaping ahead from line to line, took in the facts\nthat her mind seemed unable to grasp. Her name was Olga Stumpf. (In the\nmidst of her horror some imp in Fanny's brain said that her hands would\nbe red, and thick, with a name like that.) An orphan. She sang. One of\nthe Vienna concert halls, but so different from the other girls. And he\nwas so happy. And he hated to ask them for it, but if they could cable a\nhundred or so. That would help. And here was her picture.\n\nAnd there was her picture. One of the so-called vivacious type of\nViennese of the lower class, smiling a conscious smile, her hair\nelaborately waved and dressed, her figure high-busted, narrow-waisted;\nearrings, chains, bracelets. You knew that she used a heavy scent. She\nwas older than Theodore. Or perhaps it was the earrings.\n\nThey cabled the hundred.\n\nAfter the first shock of it Molly Brandeis found excuses for him. “He\nmust have been awfully lonely, Fanny. Often. And perhaps it will steady\nhim, and make him more ambitious. He'll probably work all the harder\nnow.”\n\n“No, he won't. But you will. And I will. I didn't mind working for\nTheodore, and scrimping, and never having any of the things I wanted,\nfrom blouses to music. But I won't work and deny myself to keep a great,\nthick, cheap, German barmaid, or whatever she is in comfort. I won't!”\n\nBut she did. And quite suddenly Molly Brandeis, of the straight, firm\nfigure and the bright, alert eye, and the buoyant humor, seemed to lose\nsome of those electric qualities. It was an almost imperceptible letting\ndown. You have seen a fine race horse suddenly break and lose his stride\nin the midst of the field, and pull up and try to gain it again, and go\nbravely on, his stride and form still there, but his spirit broken? That\nwas Molly Brandeis.\n\nFanny did much of the buying now. She bought quickly and shrewdly, like\nher mother. She even went to the Haley House to buy, when necessary, and\nWinnebagoans, passing the hotel, would see her slim, erect figure in one\nof the sample-rooms with its white-covered tables laden with china,\nor glassware, or Christmas goods, or whatever that particular salesman\nhappened to carry. They lifted their eye-brows at first, but, somehow,\nit was impossible to associate this girl with the blithe, shirt-sleeved,\ncigar-smoking traveling men who followed her about the sample-room,\norder book in hand.\n\nAs time went on she introduced some new features into the business,\nand did away with various old ones. The overflowing benches outside the\nstore were curbed, and finally disappeared altogether. Fanny took charge\nof the window displays, and often came back to the store at night to\nspend the evening at work with Aloysius. They would tack a piece\nof muslin around the window to keep off the gaze of passers-by, and\ntogether evolve a window that more than made up for the absent show\nbenches.\n\nThis, I suppose, is no time to stop for a description of Fanny Brandeis.\nAnd yet the impulse to do so is irresistible. Personally, I like to\nknow about the hair, and eyes, and mouth of the person whose life I am\nfollowing. How did she look when she said that? What sort of expression\ndid she wear when this happened? Perhaps the thing that Fanny Brandeis\nsaid about herself one day, when she was having one of her talks with\nEmma McChesney, who was on her fall trip for the Featherbloom Petticoat\nCompany, might help.\n\n“No ballroom would ever be hushed into admiring awe when I entered,” she\nsaid. “No waiter would ever drop his tray, dazzled, and no diners in a\nrestaurant would stop to gaze at me, their forks poised halfway, their\neyes blinded by my beauty. I could tramp up and down between the tables\nfor hours, and no one would know I was there. I'm one of a million women\nwho look their best in a tailor suit and a hat with a line. Not that I\never had either. But I have my points, only they're blunted just now.”\n\nStill, that bit of description doesn't do, after all. Because she had\ndistinct charm, and some beauty. She was not what is known as the Jewish\ntype, in spite of her coloring. The hair that used to curl, waved\nnow. In a day when coiffures were a bird's-nest of puffs and curls and\npompadour, she wore her hair straight back from her forehead and wound\nin a coil at the neck. Her face in repose was apt to be rather lifeless,\nand almost heavy. But when she talked, it flashed into sudden life, and\nyou found yourself watching her mouth, fascinated. It was the key to\nher whole character, that mouth. Mobile, humorous, sensitive, the\nsensuousness of the lower lip corrected by the firmness of the upper.\nShe had large, square teeth, very regular, and of the yellow-white tone\nthat bespeaks health. She used to make many of her own clothes, and she\nalways trimmed her hats. Mrs. Brandeis used to bring home material and\nstyles from her Chicago buying trips, and Fanny's quick mind adapted\nthem. She managed, somehow, to look miraculously well dressed.\n\nThe Christmas following Theodore's marriage was the most successful\none in the history of Brandeis' Bazaar. And it bred in Fanny Brandeis a\nlifelong hatred of the holiday season. In years after she always tried\nto get away from the city at Christmas time. The two women did the work\nof four men. They had a big stock on hand. Mrs. Brandeis was everywhere\nat once. She got an enormous amount of work out of her clerks, and they\ndid not resent it. It is a gift that all born leaders have. She herself\nnever sat down, and the clerks unconsciously followed her example. She\nnever complained of weariness, she never lost her temper, she never lost\npatience with a customer, even the tight-fisted farmer type who doled\ntheir money out with that reluctance found only in those who have wrung\nit from the soil.\n\nIn the midst of the rush she managed, somehow, never to fail to grasp\nthe humor of a situation. A farmer woman came in for a doll's head,\nwhich she chose with incredible deliberation and pains. As it was being\nwrapped she explained that it was for her little girl, Minnie. She had\npromised the head this year. Next Christmas they would buy a body for\nit. Molly Brandeis's quick sympathy went out to the little girl who was\nto lavish her mother-love on a doll's head for a whole year. She saw the\nhead, in ghastly decapitation, staring stiffly out from the cushions of\nthe chill and funereal parlor sofa, and the small Minnie peering in to\nfeast her eyes upon its blond and waxen beauty.\n\n“Here,” she had said, “take this, and sew it on the head, so Minnie'll\nhave something she can hold, at least.” And she had wrapped a pink\ncambric, sawdust-stuffed body in with the head.\n\nIt was a snowy and picturesque Christmas, and intensely cold, with the\nhard, dry, cutting cold of Wisconsin. Near the door the little store\nwas freezing. Every time the door opened it let in a blast. Near the big\nglowing stove it was very hot.\n\nThe aisles were packed so that sometimes it was almost impossible to\nwedge one's way through. The china plates, stacked high, fairly melted\naway, as did the dolls piled on the counters. Mrs. Brandeis imported\nher china and dolls, and no store in Winnebago, not even Gerretson's big\ndepartment store, could touch them for value.\n\nThe two women scarcely stopped to eat in the last ten days of the\nholiday rush. Often Annie, the girl who had taken Mattie's place in the\nhousehold, would bring down their supper, hot and hot, and they would\neat it quickly up in the little gallery where they kept the sleds,\nand doll buggies, and drums. At night (the store was open until ten or\neleven at Christmas time) they would trudge home through the snow, so\nnumb with weariness that they hardly minded the cold. The icy wind cut\ntheir foreheads like a knife, and made the temples ache. The snow, hard\nand resilient, squeaked beneath their heels. They would open the front\ndoor and stagger in, blinking. The house seemed so weirdly quiet and\npeaceful after the rush and clamor of the store.\n\n“Don't you want a sandwich, Mother, with a glass of beer?”\n\n“I'm too tired to eat it, Fanny. I just want to get to bed.”\n\nFanny grew to hate the stock phrases that met her with each customer. “I\nwant something for a little boy about ten. He's really got everything.”\n Or, “I'm looking for a present for a lady friend. Do you think a plate\nwould be nice?” She began to loathe them--these satiated little boys,\nthese unknown friends, for whom she must rack her brains.\n\nThey cleared a snug little fortune that Christmas. On Christmas Eve they\nsmiled wanly at each other, like two comrades who have fought and bled\ntogether, and won. When they left the store it was nearly midnight.\nBelated shoppers, bundle-laden, carrying holly wreaths, with strange\nhandles, and painted heads, and sticks protruding from lumpy brown paper\nburdens, were hurrying home.\n\nThey stumbled home, too spent to talk. Fanny, groping for the keyhole,\nstubbed her toe against a wooden box between the storm door and the\ninner door. It had evidently been left there by the expressman or a\ndelivery boy. It was a very heavy box.\n\n“A Christmas present!” Fanny exclaimed. “Do you think it is? But it must\nbe.” She looked at the address, “Miss Fanny Brandeis.” She went to the\nkitchen for a crowbar, and came back, still in her hat and coat. She\npried open the box expertly, tore away the wrappings, and disclosed a\ngleaming leather-bound set of Balzac, and beneath that, incongruously\nenough, Mark Twain.\n\n“Why!” exclaimed Fanny, sitting down on the floor rather heavily. Then\nher eye fell upon a card tossed aside in the hurry of unpacking. She\npicked it up, read it hastily. “Merry Christmas to the best daughter in\nthe world. From her Mother.”\n\nMrs. Brandeis had taken off her wraps and was standing over the\nsitting-room register, rubbing her numbed hands and smiling a little.\n\n“Why, Mother!” Fanny scrambled to her feet. “You darling! In all that\nrush and work, to take time to think of me! Why--” Her arms were around\nher mother's shoulders. She was pressing her glowing cheek against\nthe pale, cold one. And they both wept a little, from emotion, and\nweariness, and relief, and enjoyed it, as women sometimes do.\n\nFanny made her mother stay in bed next morning, a thing that Mrs.\nBrandeis took to most ungracefully. After the holiday rush and strain\nshe invariably had a severe cold, the protest of the body she had\nover-driven and under-nourished for two or three weeks. As a patient she\nwas as trying and fractious as a man, tossing about, threatening to get\nup, demanding hot-water bags, cold compresses, alcohol rubs. She fretted\nabout the business, and imagined that things were at a stand-still\nduring her absence.\n\nFanny herself rose early. Her healthy young body, after a night's sleep,\nwas already recuperating from the month's strain. She had planned a\nreal Christmas dinner, to banish the memory of the hasty and unpalatable\nlunches they had had to gulp during the rush. There was to be a turkey,\nand Fanny had warned Annie not to touch it. She wanted to stuff it and\nroast it herself. She spent the morning in the kitchen, aside from an\noccasional tip-toeing visit to her mother's room. At eleven she found\nher mother up, and no amount of coaxing would induce her to go back to\nbed. She had read the papers and she said she felt rested already.\n\nThe turkey came out a delicate golden-brown, and deliciously crackly.\nFanny, looking up over a drumstick, noticed, with a shock, that her\nmother's eyes looked strangely sunken, and her skin, around the jaws and\njust under the chin, where her loose wrapper revealed her throat, was\nqueerly yellow and shriveled. She had eaten almost nothing.\n\n“Mother, you're not eating a thing! You really must eat a little.”\n\nMrs. Brandeis began a pretense of using knife and fork, but gave it up\nfinally and sat back, smiling rather wanly. “I guess I'm tireder than\nI thought I was, dear. I think I've got a cold coming on, too. I'll\nlie down again after dinner, and by to-morrow I'll be as chipper as a\nsparrow. The turkey's wonderful, isn't it? I'll have some, cold, for\nsupper.”\n\nAfter dinner the house felt very warm and stuffy. It was crisply cold\nand sunny outdoors. The snow was piled high except on the sidewalks,\nwhere it had been neatly shoveled away by the mufflered Winnebago sons\nand fathers. There was no man in the Brandeis household, and Aloysius\nhad been too busy to perform the chores usually considered his work\nabout the house. The snow lay in drifts upon the sidewalk in front of\nthe Brandeis house, except where passing feet had trampled it a bit.\n\n“I'm going to shovel the walk,” Fanny announced suddenly. “Way around\nto the woodshed. Where are those old mittens of mine? Annie, where's the\nsnow shovel? Sure I am. Why not?”\n\nShe shoveled and scraped and pounded, bending rhythmically to the work,\nlifting each heaping shovelful with her strong young arms, tossing it to\nthe side, digging in again, and under. An occasional neighbor passed\nby, or a friend, and she waved at them, gayly, and tossed back their\nbadinage. “Merry Christmas!” she called, again and again, in reply to a\npassing acquaintance. “Same to you!”\n\nAt two o'clock Bella Weinberg telephoned to say that a little party of\nthem were going to the river to skate. The ice was wonderful. Oh, come\non! Fanny skated very well. But she hesitated. Mrs. Brandeis, dozing on\nthe couch, sensed what was going on in her daughter's mind, and roused\nherself with something of her old asperity.\n\n“Don't be foolish, child. Run along! You don't intend to sit here and\ngaze upon your sleeping beauty of a mother all afternoon, do you? Well,\nthen!”\n\nSo Fanny changed her clothes, got her skates, and ran out into the snap\nand sparkle of the day. The winter darkness had settled down before she\nreturned, all glowing and rosy, and bright-eyed. Her blood was racing\nthrough her body. Her lips were parted. The drudgery of the past three\nweeks seemed to have been blotted out by this one radiant afternoon.\n\nThe house was dark when she entered. It seemed very quiet, and close,\nand depressing after the sparkle and rush of the afternoon on the river.\n“Mother! Mother dear! Still sleeping?”\n\nMrs. Brandeis stirred, sighed, awoke. Fanny flicked on the light. Her\nmother was huddled in a kimono on the sofa. She sat up rather dazedly\nnow, and stared at Fanny.\n\n“Why--what time is it? What? Have I been sleeping all afternoon? Your\nmother's getting old.”\n\nShe yawned, and in the midst of it caught her breath with a little cry\nof pain.\n\n“What is it? What's the matter?”\n\nMolly Brandeis pressed a hand to her breast. “A stitch, I guess. It's\nthis miserable cold coming on. Is there any asperin in the house? I'll\ndose myself after supper, and take a hot foot bath and go to bed. I'm\ndead.”\n\nShe ate less for supper than she had for dinner. She hardly tasted the\ncup of tea that Fanny insisted on making for her. She swayed a little as\nshe sat, and her lids came down over her eyes, flutteringly, as if the\nweight of them was too great to keep up. At seven she was up-stairs, in\nbed, sleeping, and breathing heavily.\n\nAt eleven, or thereabouts, Fanny woke up with a start. She sat up in\nbed, wide-eyed, peering into the darkness and listening. Some one was\ntalking in a high, queer voice, a voice like her mother's, and yet\nunlike. She ran, shivering with the cold, into her mother's bedroom. She\nswitched on the light. Mrs. Brandeis was lying on the pillow, her eyes\nalmost closed, except for a terrifying slit of white that showed\nbetween the lids. Her head was tossing to and fro on the pillow. She was\ntalking, sometimes clearly, and sometimes mumblingly.\n\n“One gross cups and saucers... and now what do you think you'd like for\na second prize... in the basement, Aloysius... the trains... I'll see\nthat they get there to-day... yours of the tenth at hand...”\n\n“Mother! Mother! Molly dear!” She shook her gently, then almost roughly.\nThe voice ceased. The eyes remained the same. “Oh, God!” She ran to the\nback of the house. “Annie! Annie, get up! Mother's sick. She's out of\nher head. I'm going to 'phone for the doctor. Go in with her.”\n\nShe got the doctor at last. She tried to keep her voice under control,\nand thought, with a certain pride, that she was succeeding. She ran\nup-stairs again. The voice had begun again, but it seemed thicker now.\nShe got into her clothes, shaking with cold and terror, and yet thinking\nvery clearly, as she always did in a crisis. She put clean towels in\nthe bathroom, pushed the table up to the bed, got a glass of water,\nstraightened the covers, put away the clothes that the tired woman\nhad left about the room. Doctor Hertz came. He went through the usual\npreliminaries, listened, tapped, counted, straightened up at last.\n\n“Fresh air,” he said. “Cold air. All the windows open.” They rigged up\na device of screens and sheets to protect the bed from the drafts. Fanny\nobeyed orders silently, like a soldier. But her eyes went from the face\non the pillow to that of the man bent over the bed. Something vague,\ncold, clammy, seemed to be closing itself around her heart. It was\nlike an icy hand, squeezing there. There had suddenly sprung up that\nindefinable atmosphere of the sick-room--a sick-room in which a fight is\nbeing waged. Bottles on the table, glasses, a spoon, a paper shade over\nthe electric light globe.\n\n“What is it?” said Fanny, at last. “Grip?--grip?”\n\nDoctor Hertz hesitated a moment. “Pneumonia.”\n\nFanny's hands grasped the footboard tightly. “Do you think we'd better\nhave a nurse?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nThe nurse seemed to be there, somehow, miraculously. And the morning\ncame. And in the kitchen Annie went about her work, a little more\nquietly than usual. And yesterday seemed far away. It was afternoon; it\nwas twilight. Doctor Hertz had been there for hours. The last time he\nbrought another doctor with him--Thorn. Mrs. Brandeis was not talking\nnow. But she was breathing. It filled the room, that breathing; it\nfilled the house. Fanny took her mother's hand, that hand with the\nwork-hardened palm and the broken nails. It was very cold. She looked\ndown at it. The nails were blue. She began to rub it. She looked up into\nthe faces of the two men. She picked up the other hand--snatched at it.\n“Look here!” she said. “Look here!” And then she stood up. The vague,\nclammy thing that had been wound about her heart suddenly relaxed. And\nat that something icy hot rushed all over her body and shook her. She\ncame around to the foot of the bed, and gripped it with her two hands.\nHer chin was thrust forward, and her eyes were bright and staring. She\nlooked very much like her mother, just then. It was a fighting face. A\ndesperate face.\n\n“Look here,” she began, and was surprised to find that she was only\nwhispering. She wet her lips and smiled, and tried again, forming the\nwords carefully with her lips. “Look here. She's dying--isn't she? Isn't\nshe! She's dying, isn't she?”\n\nDoctor Hertz pursed his lips. The nurse came over to her, and put a hand\non her shoulder. Fanny shook her off.\n\n“Answer me. I've got a right to know. Look at this!” She reached forward\nand picked up that inert, cold, strangely shriveled blue hand again.\n\n“My dear child--I'm afraid so.”\n\nThere came from Fanny's throat a moan that began high, and poignant, and\nquavering, and ended in a shiver that seemed to die in her heart. The\nroom was still again, except for the breathing, and even that was less\nraucous.\n\nFanny stared at the woman on the bed--at the long, finely-shaped head,\nwith the black hair wadded up so carelessly now; at the long, straight,\nclever nose; the full, generous mouth. There flooded her whole being a\ngreat, blinding rage. What had she had of life? she demanded fiercely.\nWhat? What? Her teeth came together grindingly. She breathed heavily\nthrough her nostrils, as if she had been running. And suddenly she began\nto pray, not with the sounding, unctions thees and thous of the Church\nand Bible; not elegantly or eloquently, with well-rounded phrases, as\nthe righteous pray, but threateningly, hoarsely, as a desperate woman\nprays. It was not a prayer so much as a cry of defiance---a challenge.\n\n“Look here, God!” and there was nothing profane as she said it. “Look\nhere, God! She's done her part. It's up to You now. Don't You let her\ndie! Look at her. Look at her!” She choked and shook herself angrily,\nand went on. “Is that fair? That's a rotten trick to play on a woman\nthat gave what she gave! What did she ever have of life? Nothing! That\nlittle miserable, dirty store, and those little miserable, dirty people.\nYou give her a chance, d'You hear? You give her a chance, God, or\nI'll----”\n\nHer voice broke in a thin, cracked quaver. The nurse turned her around,\nsuddenly and sharply, and led her from the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n\n“You can come down now. They're all here, I guess. Doctor Thalmann's\ngoing to begin.” Fanny, huddled in a chair in her bedroom, looked up\ninto the plump, kindly face of the woman who was bending over her.\nThen she stood up, docilely, and walked toward the stairs with a heavy,\nstumbling step.\n\n“I'd put down my veil if I were you,” said the neighbor woman. And\nreached up for the black folds that draped Fanny's hat. Fanny's fingers\nreached for them too, fumblingly. “I'd forgotten about it,” she said.\nThe heavy crape fell about her shoulders, mercifully hiding the swollen,\ndiscolored face. She went down the stairs. There was a little stir,\na swaying toward her, a sibilant murmur of sympathy from the crowded\nsitting-room as she passed through to the parlor where Rabbi Thalmann\nstood waiting, prayer book in hand, in front of that which was covered\nwith flowers. Fanny sat down. A feeling of unreality was strong upon\nher. Doctor Thalmann cleared his throat and opened the book.\n\nAfter all, it was not Rabbi Thalmann's funeral sermon that testified to\nMrs. Brandeis's standing in the community. It was the character of the\ngathering that listened to what he had to say. Each had his own opinion\nof Molly Brandeis, and needed no final eulogy to confirm it. Father\nFitzpatrick was there, tall, handsome, ruddy, the two wings of white\nshowing at the temples making him look more than ever like a leading\nman. He had been of those who had sat in what he called Mrs. Brandeis's\nconfessional, there in the quiet little store. The two had talked of\nthings theological and things earthy. His wit, quick though it was, was\nno match for hers, but they both had a humor sense and a drama sense,\nand one day they discovered, queerly enough, that they worshiped the\nsame God. Any one of these things is basis enough for a friendship.\nBesides, Molly Brandeis could tell an Irish story inimitably. And you\nshould have heard Father Fitzpatrick do the one about Ikey and the\nnickel. No, I think the Catholic priest, seeming to listen with such\nrespectful attention, really heard very little of what Rabbi Thalmann\nhad to say.\n\nHerman Walthers was there, he of the First National Bank of Winnebago,\nwhose visits had once brought such terror to Molly Brandeis. Augustus G.\nGerretson was there, and three of his department heads. Emil Bauer sat\njust behind him. In a corner was Sadie, the erstwhile coquette, very\nsubdued now, and months behind the fashions in everything but baby\nclothes. Hen Cody, who had done all of Molly Brandeis's draying, sat,\nin unaccustomed black, next to Mayor A. J. Dawes. Temple Emmanu-el\nwas there, almost a unit. The officers of Temple Emanu-el Ladies' Aid\nSociety sat in a row. They had never honored Molly Brandeis with office\nin the society--she who could have managed its business, politics and\nsocial activities with one hand tied behind her, and both her bright\neyes shut. In the kitchen and on the porch and in the hallway stood\ncertain obscure people--women whose finger tips stuck out of their\ncotton gloves, and whose skirts dipped ludicrously in the back. Only\nMolly Brandeis could have identified them for you. Mrs. Brosch, the\nbutter and egg woman, hovered in the dining-room doorway. She had\nbrought a pound of butter. It was her contribution to the funeral baked\nmeats. She had deposited it furtively on the kitchen table. Birdie\nCallahan, head waitress at the Haley House, found a seat just next to\nthe elegant Mrs. Morehouse, who led the Golf Club crowd. A haughty young\nlady in the dining-room, Birdie Callahan, in her stiffly starched white,\nbut beneath the icy crust of her hauteur was a molten mass of good humor\nand friendliness. She and Molly Brandeis had had much in common.\n\nBut no one--not even Fanny Brandeis--ever knew who sent the great\ncluster of American Beauty roses that had come all the way from\nMilwaukee. There had been no card, so who could have guessed that they\ncame from Blanche Devine. Blanche Devine, of the white powder, and the\nminks, and the diamonds, and the high-heeled shoes, and the plumes,\nlived in the house with the closed shutters, near the freight depot.\nShe often came into Brandeis' Bazaar. Molly Brandeis had never allowed\nSadie, or Pearl, or Fanny or Aloysius to wait on her. She had attended\nto her herself. And one day, for some reason, Blanche Devine found\nherself telling Molly Brandeis how she had come to be Blanche Devine,\nand it was a moving and terrible story. And now her cardless flowers, a\ngreat, scarlet sheaf of them, lay next the chaste white roses that had\nbeen sent by the Temple Emanu-el Ladies' Aid. Truly, death is a great\nleveler.\n\nIn a vague way Fanny seemed to realize that all these people were\nthere. I think she must even have found a certain grim comfort in their\npresence. Hers had not been the dry-eyed grief of the strong, such as\nyou read about. She had wept, night and day, hopelessly, inconsolably,\ntorturing herself with remorseful questions. If she had not gone\nskating, might she not have seen how ill her mother was? Why hadn't\nshe insisted on the doctor when her mother refused to eat the Christmas\ndinner? Blind and selfish, she told herself; blind and selfish. Her face\nwas swollen and distorted now, and she was thankful for the black veil\nthat shielded her. Winnebago was scandalized to see that she wore no\nother black. Mrs. Brandeis had never wanted Fanny to wear it; she hadn't\nenough color, she said. So now she was dressed in her winter suit of\nblue, and her hat with the pert blue quill. And the little rabbi's voice\nwent on and on, and Fanny knew that it could not be true. What had all\nthis dust-to-dust talk to do with any one as vital, and electric, and\nconstructive as Molly Brandeis. In the midst of the service there was a\nsharp cry, and a little stir, and the sound of stifled sobbing. It was\nAloysius the merry, Aloysius the faithful, whose Irish heart was quite\nbroken. Fanny ground her teeth together in an effort at self-control.\n\nAnd so to the end, and out past the little hushed, respectful group\non the porch, to the Jewish cemetery on the state road. The snow of\nChristmas week was quite virgin there, except for that one spot where\nthe sexton and his men had been at work. Then back at a smart jog trot\nthrough the early dusk of the winter afternoon, the carriage wheels\ncreaking upon the hard, dry snow. And Fanny Brandeis said to herself\n(she must have been a little light-headed from hunger and weeping):\n\n“Now I'll know whether it's true or not. When I go into the house. If\nshe's there she'll say, `Well Fanchen! Hungry? Oh, but my little girl's\nhands are cold! Come here to the register and warm them.' O God, let her\nbe there! Let her be there!”\n\nBut she wasn't. The house had been set to rights by brisk and\nunaccustomed hands. There was a bustle and stir in the dining-room, and\nfrom the kitchen came the appetizing odors of cooking food. Fanny went\nup to a chair that was out of its place, and shoved it back against the\nwall where it belonged. She straightened a rug, carried the waste basket\nfrom the desk to the spot near the living-room table where it had always\nserved to hide the shabby, worn place in the rug. Fanny went up-stairs,\npast The Room that was once more just a comfortable, old fashioned\nbedroom, instead of a mysterious and awful chamber; bathed her face,\ntidied her hair, came down-stairs again, ate and drank things hot and\nrevivifying. The house was full of kindly women.\n\nFanny found herself clinging to them--clinging desperately to these\nample, broad-bosomed, soothing women whom she had scarcely known before.\nThey were always there, those women, and their husbands too; kindly,\nawkward men, who patted her shoulder, and who spoke of Molly Brandeis\nwith that sincerity of admiration such as men usually give only to men.\nPeople were constantly popping in at the back door with napkin-covered\ntrays, and dishes and baskets. A wonderful and beautiful thing, that\nhomely small-town sympathy that knows the value of physical comfort in\ntime of spiritual anguish.\n\nTwo days after the funeral Fanny Brandeis went back to the store, much\nas her mother had done many years before, after her husband's death. She\nlooked about at the bright, well-stocked shelves and tables with a new\neye--a speculative eye. The Christmas season was over. January was the\ntime for inventory and for replenishment. Mrs. Brandeis had always\ngone to Chicago the second week in January for the spring stock. But\nsomething was forming in Fanny Brandeis's mind--a resolve that grew so\nrapidly as to take her breath away. Her brain felt strangely clear and\nkeen after the crashing storm of grief that had shaken her during the\npast week.\n\n“What are you going to do now?” people had asked her, curious and\ninterested. “Is Theodore coming back?”\n\n“I don't know--yet.” In answer to the first. And, “No. Why should he? He\nhas his work.”\n\n“But he could be of such help to you.”\n\n“I'll help myself,” said Fanny Brandeis, and smiled a curious smile\nthat had in it more of bitterness and less of mirth than any smile has a\nright to have.\n\nMrs. Brandeis had left a will, far-sighted business woman that she was.\nIt was a terse, clear-headed document, that gave “to Fanny Brandeis, my\ndaughter,” the six-thousand-dollar insurance, the stock, good-will and\nfixtures of Brandeis' Bazaar, the house furnishings, the few pieces of\njewelry in their old-fashioned setting. To Theodore was left the sum of\nfifteen hundred dollars. He had received his share in the years of his\nmusical education.\n\nFanny Brandeis did not go to Chicago that January. She took inventory\nof Brandeis' Bazaar, carefully and minutely. And then, just as carefully\nand minutely she took stock of Fanny Brandeis. There was something\nrelentless and terrible in the way she went about this self-analysis.\nShe walked a great deal that winter, often out through the drifts to the\nlittle cemetery. As she walked her mind was working, working. She held\nlong mental conversations with herself during these walks, and once she\nwas rather frightened to find herself talking aloud. She wondered if she\nhad done that before. And a plan was maturing in her brain, while the\nfight went on within herself, thus:\n\n“You'll never do it, Fanny. You're not built that way.”\n\n“Oh, won't I! Watch me! Give me time.”\n\n“You'll think of what your mother would have done under the same\nconditions, and you'll do that thing.”\n\n“I won't. Not unless it's the long-headed thing to do. I'm through being\nsentimental and unselfish. What did it bring her? Nothing!”\n\nThe weeks went by. Fanny worked hard in the store, and bought little.\nFebruary came, and with the spring her months of private thinking bore\nfruit. There came to Fanny Brandeis a great resolve. She would put\nherself in a high place. Every talent she possessed, every advantage,\nevery scrap of knowledge, every bit of experience, would be used toward\nthat end. She would make something of herself. It was a worldly, selfish\nresolve, born of a bitter sorrow, and ambition, and resentment. She made\nup her mind that she would admit no handicaps. Race, religion, training,\nnatural impulses--she would discard them all if they stood in her way.\nShe would leave Winnebago behind. At best, if she stayed there, she\ncould never accomplish more than to make her business a more than\nordinarily successful small-town store. And she would be--nobody. No,\nshe had had enough of that. She would crush and destroy the little girl\nwho had fasted on that Day of Atonement; the more mature girl who had\nwritten the thesis about the paper mill rag-room; the young woman who\nhad drudged in the store on Elm Street. In her place she would mold a\nhard, keen-eyed, resolute woman, whose godhead was to be success, and\nto whom success would mean money and position. She had not a head for\nmathematics, but out of the puzzling problems and syllogisms in geometry\nshe had retained in her memory this one immovable truth:\n\nA straight line is the shortest distance between two points.\n\nWith her mental eye she marked her two points, and then, starting from\nthe first, made directly for the second. But she forgot to reckon with\nthe law of tangents. She forgot, too, how paradoxical a creature\nwas this Fanny Brandeis whose eyes filled with tears at sight of a\nparade--just the sheer drama of it--were the marchers G. A. R. veterans,\nschool children in white, soldiers, Foresters, political marching clubs;\nand whose eyes burned dry and bright as she stood over the white mound\nin the cemetery on the state road. Generous, spontaneous, impulsive,\nwarm-hearted, she would be cold, calculating, deliberate, she told\nherself.\n\nThousands of years of persecution behind her made her quick to\nappreciate suffering in others, and gave her an innate sense of\nfellowship with the downtrodden. She resolved to use that sense as a\nsearchlight aiding her to see and overcome obstacles. She told herself\nthat she was done with maudlin sentimentality. On the rare occasions\nwhen she had accompanied her mother to Chicago, the two women had found\ndelight in wandering about the city's foreign quarters. When other\nsmall-town women buyers snatched occasional moments of leisure for the\ntheater or personal shopping, these two had spent hours in the ghetto\naround Jefferson and Taylor, and Fourteenth Streets. Something in\nthe sight of these people--alien, hopeful, emotional, often\ngrotesque--thrilled and interested both the women. And at sight of an\nill-clad Italian, with his slovenly, wrinkled old-young wife, turning\nthe handle of his grind organ whilst both pairs of eyes searched windows\nand porches and doorsteps with a hopeless sort of hopefulness, she lost\nher head entirely and emptied her limp pocketbook of dimes, and nickels,\nand pennies. Incidentally it might be stated that she loved the cheap\nand florid music of the hand organ itself.\n\nIt was rumored that Brandeis' Bazaar was for sale. In the spring\nGerretson's offered Fanny the position of buyer and head of the china,\nglassware, and kitchenware sections. Gerretson's showed an imposing\nblock of gleaming plate-glass front now, and drew custom from a dozen\nthrifty little towns throughout the Fox River Valley. Fanny refused the\noffer. In March she sold outright the stock, good-will, and fixtures of\nBrandeis' Bazaar. The purchaser was a thrifty, farsighted traveling\nman who had wearied of the road and wanted to settle down. She sold the\nhousehold goods too--those intimate, personal pieces of wood and cloth\nthat had become, somehow, part of her life. She had grown up with them.\nShe knew the history of every nick, every scratch and worn spot. Her\nmother lived again in every piece. The old couch went off in a farmer's\nwagon. Fanny turned away when they joggled it down the front steps and\ninto the rude vehicle. It was like another funeral. She was furious to\nfind herself weeping again. She promised herself punishment for that.\n\nUp in her bedroom she opened the bottom drawer of her bureau. That\nbureau and its history and the history of every piece of furniture in\nthe room bore mute testimony to the character of its occupant; to her\nprotest against things as she found them, and her determination to\nmake them over to suit her. She had spent innumerable Sunday mornings\nwielding the magic paint brush that had transformed the bedroom from\ndingy oak to gleaming cream enamel. She sat down on the floor now,\nbefore the bureau, and opened the bottom drawer.\n\nIn a corner at the back, under the neat pile of garments, was a\ntightly-rolled bundle of cloth. Fanny reached for it, took it out, and\nheld it in her hands a moment. Then she unrolled it slowly, and the\nbundle revealed itself to be a faded, stained, voluminous gingham apron,\nblue and white. It was the kind of apron women don when they perform\nsome very special household ritual--baking, preserving, house cleaning.\nIt crossed over the shoulders with straps, and its generous fullness ran\nall the way around the waist. It was discolored in many places with the\nbrown and reddish stains of fruit juices. It had been Molly Brandeis'\ncanning apron. Fanny had come upon it hanging on a hook behind the\nkitchen door, after that week in December. And at sight of it all her\nfortitude and forced calm had fled. She had spread her arms over the\nlimp, mute, yet speaking thing dangling there, and had wept so wildly\nand uncontrollably as to alarm even herself.\n\nNothing in connection with her mother's death had power to call up such\npoignant memories as did this homely, intimate garment. She saw again\nthe steamy kitchen, deliciously scented with the perfume of cooking\nfruit, or the tantalizing, mouth-watering spiciness of vinegar and\npickles. On the stove the big dishpan, in which the jelly glasses and\nfruit jars, with their tops and rubbers, bobbed about in hot water.\nIn the great granite kettle simmered the cooking fruit Molly Brandeis,\nenveloped in the familiar blue-and-white apron, stood over it, like a\npriestess, stirring, stirring, slowly, rhythmically. Her face would be\nhot and moist with the steam, and very tired too, for she often came\nhome from the store utterly weary, to stand over the kettle until ten\nor eleven o'clock. But the pride in it as she counted the golden or ruby\ntinted tumblers gleaming in orderly rows as they cooled on the kitchen\ntable!\n\n“Fifteen glasses of grape jell, Fan! And I didn't mix a bit of apple\nwith it. I didn't think I'd get more than ten. And nine of the quince\npreserve. That makes--let me see--eighty-three, ninety-eight--one\nhundred and seven altogether.”\n\n“We'll never eat it, Mother.”\n\n“You said that last year, and by April my preserve cupboard looked like\nOld Mother Hubbard's.”\n\nBut then, Mrs. Brandeis was famous for her preserves, as Father\nFitzpatrick, and Aloysius, and Doctor Thalmann, and a dozen others could\ntestify. After the strain and flurry of a busy day at the store there\nwas something about this homely household rite that brought a certain\nsense of rest and peace to Molly Brandeis.\n\nAll this moved through Fanny Brandeis's mind as she sat with the\ncrumpled apron in her lap, her eyes swimming with hot tears. The very\nstains that discolored it, the faded blue of the front breadth, the\nfrayed buttonhole, the little scorched place where she had burned a hole\nwhen trying unwisely to lift a steaming kettle from the stove with the\napron's corner, spoke to her with eloquent lips. That apron had become\na vice with Fanny. She brooded over it as a mother broods over the\nshapeless, scuffled bit of leather that was a baby's shoe; as a woman,\nwidowed, clings to a shabby, frayed old smoking jacket. More than once\nshe had cried herself to sleep with the apron clasped tightly in her\narms.\n\nShe got up from the floor now, with the apron in her hands, and went\ndown the stairs, opened the door that led to the cellar, walked heavily\ndown those steps and over to the furnace. She flung open the furnace\ndoor. Red and purple the coal bed gleamed, with little white flame\nsprites dancing over it. Fanny stared at it a moment, fascinated. Her\nface was set, her eyes brilliant. Suddenly she flung the tightly-rolled\napron into the heart of the gleaming mass. She shut her eyes then.\nThe fire seemed to hold its breath for a moment. Then, with a gasp, it\nsprang upon its food. The bundle stiffened, writhed, crumpled, sank, lay\na blackened heap, was dissolved. The fire bed glowed red and purple as\nbefore, except for a dark spot in its heart. Fanny shivered a little.\nShe shut the furnace door and went up-stairs again.\n\n“Smells like something burning--cloth, or something,” called Annie, from\nthe kitchen.\n\n“It's only an old apron that was cluttering up my--my bureau drawer.”\n\nThus she successfully demonstrated the first lesson in the cruel and\nrigid course of mental training she had mapped out for herself.\n\nLeaving Winnebago was not easy. There is something about a small town\nthat holds you. Your life is so intimately interwoven with that of your\nneighbor. Existence is so safe, so sane, so sure. Fanny knew that when\nshe turned the corner of Elm Street every third person she met would\nspeak to her. Life was made up of minute details, too trivial for the\nnotice of the hurrying city crowds. You knew when Milly Glaenzer changed\nthe baby buggy for a go-cart. The youngest Hupp boy--Sammy--who was\ngraduated from High School in June, is driving A. J. Dawes's automobile\nnow. My goodness, how time flies! Doeppler's grocery has put in\nplate-glass windows, and they're getting out-of-season vegetables every\nday now from Milwaukee. As you pass you get the coral glow of tomatoes,\nand the tender green of lettuces. And that vivid green? Fresh young\npeas! And in February. Well! They've torn down the old yellow brick\nNational Bank, and in its place a chaste Greek Temple of a building\nlooks rather contemptuously down its classic columns upon the farmer's\nwagons drawn up along the curb. If Fanny Brandeis' sense of proportion\nhad not been out of plumb she might have realized that, to Winnebago,\nthe new First National Bank building was as significant and epochal as\nhad been the Woolworth Building to New York.\n\nThe very intimacy of these details, Fanny argued, was another reason for\nleaving Winnebago. They were like detaining fingers that grasped at your\nskirts, impeding your progress.\n\nShe had early set about pulling every wire within her reach that might\nlead, directly or indirectly, to the furtherance of her ambition. She\ngot two offers from Milwaukee retail stores. She did not consider them\nfor a moment. Even a Chicago department store of the second grade (one\nof those on the wrong side of State Street) did not tempt her. She knew\nher value. She could afford to wait. There was money enough on which to\nlive comfortably until the right chance presented itself. She knew every\nitem of her equipment, and she conned them to herself greedily:\nDefinite charm of manner; the thing that is called magnetism; brains;\nimagination; driving force; health; youth; and, most precious of all,\nthat which money could not buy, nor education provide--experience.\nExperience, a priceless weapon, that is beaten into shape only by\nmuch contact with men and women, and that is sharpened by much rubbing\nagainst the rough edges of this world.\n\nIn April her chance came to her; came in that accidental, haphazard way\nthat momentous happenings have. She met on Elm Street a traveling man\nfrom whom Molly Brandeis had bought for years. He dropped both sample\ncases and shook hands with Fanny, eying her expertly and approvingly,\nand yet without insolence. He was a wise, road-weary, skillful member\nof his fraternity, grown gray in years of service, and a little bitter.\nThough perhaps that was due partly to traveling man's dyspepsia, brought\non by years of small-town hotel food.\n\n“So you've sold out.”\n\n“Yes. Over a month ago.”\n\n“H'm. That was a nice little business you had there. Your ma built it up\nherself. There was a woman! Gosh! Discounted her bills, even during the\npanic.”\n\nFanny smiled a reflective little smile. “That line is a complete\ncharacterization of my mother. Her life was a series of panics. But she\nnever lost her head. And she always discounted.”\n\nHe held out his hand. “Well, glad I met you.” He picked up his sample\ncases. “You leaving Winnebago?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Going to the city, I suppose. Well you're a smart girl. And your\nmother's daughter. I guess you'll get along all right. What house are\nyou going with?”\n\n“I don't know. I'm waiting for the right chance. It's all in starting\nright. I'm not going to hurry.”\n\nHe put down his cases again, and his eyes grew keen and kindly. He\ngesticulated with one broad forefinger. “Listen, m' girl. I'm what they\ncall an old-timer. They want these high-power, eight-cylinder kids on\nthe road these days, and it's all we can do to keep up. But I've got\nsomething they haven't got--yet. I never read anybody on the Psychology\nof Business, but I know human nature all the way from Elm Street,\nWinnebago, to Fifth Avenue, New York.”\n\n“I'm sure you do,” said Fanny politely, and took a little step forward,\nas though to end the conversation.\n\n“Now wait a minute. They say the way to learn is to make mistakes. If\nthat's true, I'm at the head of the class. I've made 'em all. Now get\nthis. You start out and specialize. Specialize! Tie to one thing, and\nmake yourself an expert in it. But first be sure it's the right thing.”\n\n“But how is one to be sure?”\n\n“By squinting up your eyes so you can see ten years ahead. If it looks\ngood to you at that distance--better, in fact, than it does close\nby--then it's right. I suppose that's what they call having imagination.\nI never had any. That's why I'm still selling goods on the road. To look\nat you I'd say you had too much. Maybe I'm wrong. But I never yet saw\na woman with a mouth like yours who was cut out for business--unless\nit was your mother--And her eyes were different. Let's see, what was I\nsaying?”\n\n“Specialize.”\n\n“Oh, yes. And that reminds me. Bunch of fellows in the smoker last night\ntalking about Haynes-Cooper. Your mother hated 'em like poison, the\nway every small-town merchant hates the mail-order houses. But I hear\nthey've got an infants' wear department that's just going to grass for\nlack of a proper head. You're only a kid. And they have done you dirt\nall these years, of course. But if you could sort of horn in there--why,\nsay, there's no limit to the distance you could go. No limit! With your\nbrains and experience.”\n\nThat had been the beginning. From then on the thing had moved forward\nwith a certain inevitableness. There was something about the vastness of\nthe thing that appealed to Fanny. Here was an organization whose great\narms embraced the world. Haynes-Cooper, giant among mail-order houses,\nwas said to eat a small-town merchant every morning for breakfast.\n\n“There's a Haynes-Cooper catalogue in every farmer's kitchen,” Molly\nBrandeis used to say. “The Bible's in the parlor, but they keep the H.\nC. book in the room where they live.”\n\nThat she was about to affiliate herself with this house appealed to\nFanny Brandeis's sense of comedy. She had heard her mother presenting\nher arguments to the stubborn farmer folk who insisted on ordering their\nstove, or dinner set, or plow, or kitchen goods from the fascinating\ncatalogue. “I honestly think it's just the craving for excitement that\nmakes them do it,” she often said. “They want the thrill they get\nwhen they receive a box from Chicago, and open it, and take off the\nwrappings, and dig out the thing they ordered from a picture, not\nknowing whether it will be right or wrong.”\n\nHer arguments usually left the farmer unmoved. He would drive into town,\nmail his painfully written letter and order at the post-office, dispose\nof his load of apples, or butter, or cheese, or vegetables, and drive\ncheerfully back again, his empty wagon bumping and rattling down the old\ncorduroy road. Express, breakage, risk, loyalty to his own region--an\nthese arguments left him cold.\n\nIn May, after much manipulation, correspondence, two interviews, came a\ndefinite offer from the Haynes-Cooper Company. It was much less than the\nState Street store had offered, and there was something tentative about\nthe whole agreement. Haynes-Cooper proffered little and demanded much,\nas is the way of the rich and mighty. But Fanny remembered the ten-year\nviewpoint that the weary-wise old traveling man had spoken about. She\ntook their offer. She was to go to Chicago almost at once, to begin work\nJune first.\n\nTwo conversations that took place before she left are perhaps worth\nrecording. One was with Father Fitzpatrick of St. Ignatius Catholic\nChurch. The other with Rabbi Emil Thalmann of Temple Emanu-el.\n\nAn impulse brought her into Father Fitzpatrick's study. It was a week\nbefore her departure. She was tired. There had been much last signing of\npapers, nailing of boxes, strapping of trunks. When things began to come\ntoo thick and fast for her she put on her hat and went for a walk at the\nclose of the May day. May, in Wisconsin, is a thing all fragrant, and\ngold, and blue; and white with cherry blossoms; and pink with apple\nblossoms; and tremulous with budding things.\n\nFanny struck out westward through the neat streets of the little town,\nand found herself on the bridge over the ravine in which she had played\nwhen a little girl--the ravine that her childish imagination had\npeopled with such pageantry of redskin, and priests, and voyageurs,\nand cavaliers. She leaned over the iron railing and looked down.\nWhere grass, and brook, and wild flower had been there now oozed great\neruptions of ash heaps, tin cans, broken bottles, mounds of dirt.\nWinnebago's growing pains had begun. Fanny turned away with a little\nsick feeling. She went on across the bridge past the Catholic church.\nJust next the church was the parish house where Father Fitzpatrick\nlived. It always looked as if it had been scrubbed, inside and out, with\na scouring brick. Its windows were a reproach and a challenge to every\nhousekeeper in Winnebago.\n\nFanny wanted to talk to somebody about that ravine. She was full of it.\nFather Fitzpatrick's study over-looked it. Besides, she wanted to\nsee him before she left Winnebago. A picture came to her mind of his\nhandsome, ruddy face, twinkling with humor as she had last seen it when\nhe had dropped in at Brandeis' Bazaar for a chat with her mother. She\nturned in at the gate and ran up the immaculate, gray-painted steps,\nthat always gleamed as though still wet with the paint brush.\n\n“I shouldn't wonder if that housekeeper of his comes out with a pail\nof paint and does 'em every morning before breakfast,” Fanny said to\nherself as she rang the bell.\n\nUsually it was that sparse and spectacled person herself who opened the\nparish house door, but to-day Fanny's ring was answered by Father Casey,\nparish assistant. A sour-faced and suspicious young man, Father Casey,\nthick-spectacled, and pointed of nose. Nothing of the jolly priest about\nhim. He was new to the town, but he recognized Fanny and surveyed her\ndarkly.\n\n“Father Fitzpatrick in? I'm Fanny Brandeis.”\n\n“The reverend father is busy,” and the glass door began to close.\n\n“Who is it?” boomed a voice from within. “Who're you turning away,\nCasey?”\n\n“A woman, not a parishioner.” The door was almost shut now.\n\n\nFootsteps down the hall. “Good! Let her in.” The door opened ever so\nreluctantly. Father Fitzpatrick loomed up beside his puny assistant,\ndwarfing him. He looked sharply at the figure on the porch. “For the\nlove of--! Casey, you're a fool! How you ever got beyond being an\naltar-boy is more than I can see. Come in, child. Come in! The man's cut\nout for a jailor, not a priest.”\n\nFanny's two hands were caught in one of his big ones, and she was led\ndown the hall to the study. It was the room of a scholar and a man, and\nthe one spot in the house that defied the housekeeper's weapons of broom\nand duster. A comfortable and disreputable room, full of books, and\nfishing tackle, and chairs with sagging springs, and a sofa that was\ndented with friendly hollows. Pipes on the disorderly desk. A copy\nof “Mr. Dooley” spread face down on what appeared to be next Sunday's\nsermon, rough-drafted.\n\n“I just wanted to talk to you.” Fanny drifted to the shelves, book-lover\nthat she was, and ran a finger over a half-dozen titles. “Your assistant\nwas justified, really, in closing the door on me. But I'm glad you\nrescued me.” She came over to him and stood looking up at him. He seemed\nto loom up endlessly, though hers was a medium height. “I think I really\nwanted to talk to you about that ravine, though I came to say good-by.”\n\n“Sit down, child, sit down!” He creaked into his great\nleather-upholstered desk chair, himself. “If you had left without seeing\nme I'd have excommunicated Casey. Between you and me the man's mad. His\njob ought to be duenna to a Spanish maiden, not assistant to a priest\nwith a leaning toward the flesh.”\n\nNow, Father Fitzpatrick talked with a--no, you couldn't call it a\nbrogue. It was nothing so gross as that. One does not speak of the\nflavor of a rare wine; one calls attention to its bouquet. A subtle,\nteasing, elusive something that just tickles the senses instead\nof punching them in the ribs. So his speech was permeated with a\nwill-o'-the-wisp, a tingling richness that evaded definition. You will\nhave to imagine it. There shall be no vain attempt to set it down.\nBesides, you always skip dialect.\n\n“So you're going away. I'd heard. Where to?”\n\n“Chicago, Haynes-Cooper. It's a wonderful chance. I don't see yet how\nI got it. There's only one other woman on their business staff--I mean\nworking actually in an executive way in the buying and selling end of\nthe business. Of course there are thousands doing clerical work, and\nthat kind of thing. Have you ever been through the plant? It's--it's\nincredible.”\n\nFather Fitzpatrick drummed with his fingers on the arm of his chair, and\nlooked at Fanny, his handsome eyes half shut.\n\n“So it's going to be business, h'm? Well, I suppose it's only natural.\nYour mother and I used to talk about you often. I don't know if you and\nshe ever spoke seriously of this little trick of drawing, or cartooning,\nor whatever it is you have. She used to think about it. She said once to\nme, that it looked to her more than just a knack. An authentic gift of\ncaricature, she called it--if it could only be developed. But of course\nTheodore took everything. That worried her.”\n\n“Oh, nonsense! That! I just amuse myself with it.”\n\n“Yes. But what amuses you might amuse other people. There's all too few\namusing things in the world. Your mother was a smart woman, Fanny. The\nsmartest I ever knew.”\n\n“There's no money in it, even if I were to get on with it. What could\nI do with it? Who ever heard of a woman cartoonist! And I couldn't\nillustrate. Those pink cheesecloth pictures the magazines use. I want to\nearn money. Lots of it. And now.”\n\nShe got up and went to the window, and stood looking down the steep\ngreen slope of the ravine that lay, a natural amphitheater, just below.\n\n“Money, h'm?” mused Father Fitzpatrick. “Well, it's popular and handy.\nAnd you look to me like the kind of girl who'd get it, once you started\nout for it. I've never had much myself. They say it has a way of turning\nto dust and ashes in the mouth, once you get a good, satisfying bite of\nit. But that's only talk, I suppose.”\n\nFanny laughed a little, still looking down at the ravine. “I'm fairly\naccustomed to dust and ashes by this time. It won't be a new taste to\nme.” She whirled around suddenly. “And speaking of dust and ashes, isn't\nthis a shame? A crime? Why doesn't somebody stop it? Why don't you stop\nit?” She pointed to the desecrated ravine below. Her eyes were blazing,\nher face all animation.\n\nFather Fitzpatrick came over and stood beside her. His face was sad.\n“It's a--” He stopped abruptly, and looked down into her glowing face.\nHe cleared his throat. “It's a perfectly natural state of affairs,” he\nsaid smoothly. “Winnebago's growing. Especially over there on the west\nside, since the new mill went up, and they've extended the street car\nline. They need the land to build on. It's business. And money.”\n\n“Business! It's a crime! It's wanton! Those ravines are the most\nbeautiful natural spots in Wisconsin. Why, they're history, and romance,\nand beauty!”\n\n“So that's the way you feel about it?”\n\n“Of course. Don't you? Can't you stop it? Petitions--”\n\n“Certainly I feel it's an outrage. But I'm just a poor fool of a priest,\nand sentimental, with no head for business. Now you're a business woman,\nand different.”\n\n“I! You're joking.”\n\n“Say, listen, m' girl. The world's made up of just two things: ravines\nand dump heaps. And the dumpers are forever edging up, and squeedging\nup, and trying to grab the ravines and spoil 'em, when nobody's looking.\nYou've made your choice, and allied yourself with the dump heaps. What\nright have you to cry out against the desecration of the ravines?”\n\n“The right that every one has that loves them.”\n\n“Child, you're going to get so used to seeing your ravines choked up at\nHaynes-Cooper that after a while you'll prefer 'em that way.”\n\nFanny turned on him passionately. “I won't! And if I do, perhaps it's\njust as well. There's such a thing as too much ravine. What do you want\nme to do? Stay here, and grub away, and become a crabbed old maid like\nIrma Klein, thankful to be taken around by the married crowd, joining\nthe Aid Society and going to the card parties on Sunday nights? Or I\ncould marry a traveling man, perhaps, or Lee Kohn of the Golden Eagle.\nI'm just like any other ambitious woman with brains--”\n\n“No you're not. You're different. And I'll tell you why. You're a Jew.”\n\n“Yes, I've got that handicap.”\n\n“That isn't a handicap, Fanny. It's an asset. Outwardly you're like\nany other girl of your age. Inwardly you've been molded by occupation,\ntraining, religion, history, temperament, race, into something--”\n\n“Ethnologists have proved that there is no such thing as a Jewish race,”\n she interrupted pertly.\n\n“H'm. Maybe. I don't know what you'd call it, then. You can't take a\npeople and persecute them for thousands of years, hounding them from\nplace to place, herding them in dark and filthy streets, without leaving\nsome sort of brand on them--a mark that differentiates. Sometimes it\ndoesn't show outwardly. But it's there, inside. You know, Fanny, how\nit's always been said that no artist can became a genius until he has\nsuffered. You've suffered, you Jews, for centuries and centuries, until\nyou're all artists--quick to see drama because you've lived in it,\nemotional, oversensitive, cringing, or swaggering, high-strung,\ndemonstrative, affectionate, generous.\n\n“Maybe they're right. Perhaps it isn't a race. But what do you call the\nthing, then, that made you draw me as you did that morning when you came\nto ten o'clock mass and did a caricature of me in the pulpit. You showed\nup something that I've been trying to hide for twenty years, till I'd\nfooled everybody, including myself. My church is always packed. Nobody\nelse there ever saw it. I'll tell you, Fanny, what I've always said: the\nIrish would be the greatest people in the world--if it weren't for the\nJews.”\n\nThey laughed together at that, and the tension was relieved.\n\n“Well, anyway,” said Fanny, and patted his great arm, “I'd rather talk\nto you than to any man in the world.”\n\n“I hope you won't be able to say that a year from now, dear girl.”\n\nAnd so they parted. He took her to the door himself, and watched her\nslim figure down the street and across the ravine bridge, and thought\nshe walked very much like her mother, shoulders squared, chin high, hips\nfirm. He went back into the house, after surveying the sunset largely,\nand encountered the dour Casey in the hall.\n\n“I'll type your sermon now, sir--if it's done.”\n\n“It isn't done, Casey. And you know it. Oh, Casey,”--(I wish your\nimagination would supply that brogue, because it was such a deliciously\nsoft and racy thing)--“Oh, Casey, Casey! you're a better priest than I\nam--but a poorer man.”\n\nFanny was to leave Winnebago the following Saturday. She had sold the\nlast of the household furniture, and had taken a room at the Haley\nHouse. She felt very old and experienced--and sad. That, she told\nherself, was only natural. Leaving things to which one is accustomed is\nalways hard. Queerly enough, it was her good-by to Aloysius that most\nunnerved her. Aloysius had been taken on at Gerretson's, and the dignity\nof his new position sat heavily upon him. You should have seen his ties.\nFanny sought him out at Gerretson's.\n\n“It's flure-manager of the basement I am,” he said, and struck an\nelegant attitude against the case of misses'-ready-to-wear coats. “And\nwhen you come back to Winnebago, Miss Fanny,--and the saints send it\nbe soon--I'll bet ye'll see me on th' first flure, keepin' a stern but\nkindly eye on the swellest trade in town. Ev'ry last thing I know I\nlearned off yur poor ma.”\n\n“I hope it will serve you here, Aloysius.”\n\n“Sarve me!” He bent closer. “Meanin' no offense, Miss Fanny; but say,\nlisten: Oncet ye get a Yiddish business education into an Irish head,\nand there's no limit to the length ye can go. If I ain't a dry-goods\nking be th' time I'm thirty I hope a packin' case'll fall on me.”\n\nThe sight of Aloysius seemed to recall so vividly all that was happy and\nall that was hateful about Brandeis' Bazaar; all the bravery and pluck,\nand resourcefulness of the bright-eyed woman he had admiringly called\nhis boss, that Fanny found her self-control slipping. She put out her\nhand rather blindly to meet his great red paw (a dressy striped cuff\nseemed to make it all the redder), murmured a word of thanks in return\nfor his fervent good wishes, and fled up the basement stairs.\n\nOn Friday night (she was to leave next day) she went to the temple. The\nevening service began at seven. At half past six Fanny had finished her\nearly supper. She would drop in at Doctor Thalmann's house and walk with\nhim to temple, if he had not already gone.\n\n“Nein, der Herr Rabbi ist noch hier--sure,” the maid said in answer\nto Fanny's question. The Thalmann's had a German maid--one Minna--who\nbullied the invalid Mrs. Thalmann, was famous for her cookies with\nwalnuts on the top, and who made life exceedingly difficult for\nunlinguistic callers.\n\nRabbi Thalmann was up in his study. Fanny ran lightly up the stairs.\n\n“Who is it, Emil? That Minna! Next Monday her week is up. She goes.”\n\n“It's I, Mrs. Thalmann. Fanny Brandeis.”\n\n“Na, Fanny! Now what do you think!”\n\nIn the brightly-lighted doorway of his little study appeared Rabbi\nThalmann, on one foot a comfortable old romeo, on the other a street\nshoe. He held out both hands. “Only at supper we talked about you. Isn't\nthat so, Harriet?” He called into the darkened room.\n\n“I came to say good-by. And I thought we might walk to temple together.\nHow's Mrs. Thalmann tonight?”\n\nThe little rabbi shook his head darkly, and waved a dismal hand. But\nthat was for Fanny alone. What he said was: “She's really splendid\nto-day. A little tired, perhaps; but what is that?”\n\n“Emil!” from the darkened bedroom. “How can you say that? But how! What\nI have suffered to-day, only! Torture! And because I say nothing I'm not\nsick.”\n\n“Go in,” said Rabbi Thalmann.\n\nSo Fanny went in to the woman lying, yellow-faced, on the pillows of the\ndim old-fashioned bedroom with its walnut furniture, and its red plush\nmantel drape. Mrs. Thalmann held out a hand. Fanny took it in hers, and\nperched herself on the edge of the bed. She patted the dry, devitalized\nhand, and pressed it in her own strong, electric grip. Mrs. Thalmann\nraised her head from the pillow.\n\n“Tell me, did she have her white apron on?”\n\n“White apron?”\n\n“Minna, the girl.”\n\n“Oh!” Fanny's mind jerked back to the gingham-covered figure that had\nopened the door for her. “Yes,” she lied, “a white one--with crochet\naround the bottom. Quite grand.”\n\nMrs. Thalmann sank back on the pillow with a satisfied sigh. “A wonder.”\n She shook her head. “What that girl wastes alone, when I am helpless\nhere.”\n\nRabbi Thalmann came into the room, both feet booted now, and placed his\nslippers neatly, toes out, under the bed. “Ach, Harriet, the girl is all\nright. You imagine. Come, Fanny.” He took a great, fat watch out of his\npocket. “It is time to go.”\n\nMrs. Thalmann laid a detaining hand on Fanny's arm. “You will come often\nback here to Winnebago?”\n\n“I'm afraid not. Once a year, perhaps, to visit my graves.”\n\nThe sick eyes regarded the fresh young face. “Your mother, Fanny,\nwe didn't understand her so well, here in Winnebago, among us Jewish\nladies. She was different.”\n\nFanny's face hardened. She stood up. “Yes, she was different.”\n\n“She comes often into my mind now, when I am here alone, with only the\nfour walls. We were aber dumm, we women--but how dumm! She was too smart\nfor us, your mother. Too smart. Und eine sehr brave frau.”\n\nAnd suddenly Fanny, she who had resolved to set her face against all\nemotion, and all sentiment, found herself with her glowing cheek pressed\nagainst the withered one, and it was the weak old hand that patted her\nnow. So she lay for a moment, silent. Then she got up, straightened her\nhat, smiled.\n\n“Auf Wiedersehen,” she said in her best German. “Und gute Besserung.”\n\nBut the rabbi's wife shook her head. “Good-by.”\n\nFrom the hall below Doctor Thalmann called to her. “Come, child, come!”\n Then, “Ach, the light in my study! I forgot to turn it out, Fanny, be so\ngood, yes?”\n\nFanny entered the bright little room, reached up to turn off the light,\nand paused a moment to glance about her. It was an ugly, comfortable,\nold-fashioned room that had never progressed beyond the what-not period.\nFanny's eye was caught by certain framed pictures on the walls.\nThey were photographs of Rabbi Thalmann's confirmation classes.\nSpindling-legged little boys in the splendor of patent-leather buttoned\nshoes, stiff white shirts, black broadcloth suits with satin lapels;\nself-conscious and awkward little girls--these in the minority--in white\ndresses and stiff white hair bows. In the center of each group sat the\nlittle rabbi, very proud and alert. Fanny was not among these. She had\nnever formally taken the vows of her creed. As she turned down the light\nnow, and found her way down the stairs, she told herself that she was\nglad this was so.\n\nIt was a matter of only four blocks to the temple. But they were late,\nand so they hurried, and there was little conversation. Fanny's arm was\ntucked comfortably in his. It felt, somehow, startlingly thin, that arm.\nAnd as they hurried along there was a jerky feebleness about his gait.\nIt was with difficulty that Fanny restrained herself from supporting him\nwhen they came to a rough bit of walk or a sudden step. Something fine\nin her prompted her not to. But the alert mind in that old frame sensed\nwhat was going on in her thoughts.\n\n“He's getting feeble, the old rabbi, h'm?”\n\n“Not a bit of it. I've got all I can do to keep up with you. You set\nsuch a pace.”\n\n“I know. I know. They are not all so kind, Fanny. They are too\nprosperous, this congregation of mine. And some day, `Off with his\nhead!' And in my place there will step a young man, with eye-glasses\ninstead of spectacles. They are tired of hearing about the prophets.\nTexts from the Bible have gone out of fashion. You think I do not see\nthem giggling, h'm? The young people. And the whispering in the choir\nloft. And the buzz when I get up from my chair after the second hymn.\n`Is he going to have a sermon? Is he? Sure enough!' Na, he will make\nthem sit up, my successor. Sex sermons! Political lectures. That's it.\nLectures.” They were turning in at the temple now. “The race is to the\nyoung, Fanny. To the young. And I am old.”\n\nShe squeezed the frail old arm in hers. “My dear!” she said. “My dear!”\n A second breaking of her new resolutions.\n\nOne by one, two by two, they straggled in for the Friday evening\nservice, these placid, prosperous people, not unkind, but careless,\nperhaps, in their prosperity.\n\n“He's worth any ten of them,” Fanny said hotly to herself, as she sat\nin her pew that, after to-morrow, would no longer be hers. “The dear\nold thing. `Sex sermons.' And the race is to the young. How right he is.\nWell, no one can say I'm not getting an early start.”\n\nThe choir had begun the first hymn when there came down the aisle a\nstranger. There was a little stir among the congregation. Visitors were\nrare. He was dark and very slim--with the slimness of steel wire.\nHe passed down the aisle rather uncertainly. A traveling man, Fanny\nthought, dropped in, as sometimes they did, to say Kaddish for a\ndeparted father or mother. Then she changed her mind. Her quick\neye noted his walk; a peculiar walk, with a spring in it. Only one\nunfamiliar with cement pavements could walk like that. The Indians must\nhave had that same light, muscular step. He chose an empty pew halfway\ndown the aisle and stumbled into it rather awkwardly. Fanny thought he\nwas unnecessarily ugly, even for a man. Then he looked up, and nodded\nand smiled at Lee Kohn, across the aisle. His teeth were very white,\nand the smile was singularly sweet. Fanny changed her mind again. Not\nso bad-looking, after all. Different, anyway. And then--why, of course!\nLittle Clarence Heyl, come back from the West. Clarence Heyl, the\ncowardy-cat.\n\nHer mind went back to that day of the street fight. She smiled. At that\nmoment Clarence Heyl, who had been screwing about most shockingly, as\nthough searching for some one, turned and met her smile, intended for\nno one, with a startlingly radiant one of his own, intended most plainly\nfor her. He half started forward in his pew, and then remembered, and\nsat back again, but with an effect of impermanence that was ludicrous.\nIt had been years since he had left Winnebago. At the time of his\nmother's death they had tried to reach him, and had been unable to\nget in touch with him for weeks. He had been off on some mountain\nexpedition, hundreds of miles from railroad or telegraph. Fanny\nremembered having read about him in the Winnebago Courier. He seemed\nto be climbing mountains a great deal--rather difficult mountains,\nevidently, from the fuss they made over it. A queer enough occupation\nfor a cowardy-cat. There had been a book, too. About the Rockies. She\nhad not read it. She rather disliked these nature books, as do most\nnature lovers. She told herself that when she came upon a flaming golden\nmaple in October she was content to know it was a maple, and to warm her\nsoul at its blaze.\n\nThere had been something in the Chicago Herald, though--oh, yes; it had\nspoken of him as the brilliant young naturalist, Clarence Heyl. He was\nto have gone on an expedition with Roosevelt. A sprained ankle, or some\nsuch thing, had prevented. Fanny smiled again, to herself. His mother,\nthe fussy person who had been responsible for his boyhood reefers and\ntoo-shiny shoes, and his cowardice too, no doubt, had dreamed of seeing\nher Clarence a rabbi.\n\nFrom that point Fanny's thoughts wandered to the brave old man in the\npulpit. She had heard almost nothing of the service. She looked at him\nnow--at him, and then at his congregation, inattentive and palpably\nbored. As always with her, the thing stamped itself on her mind as a\npicture. She was forever seeing a situation in terms of its human value.\nHow small he looked, how frail, against the background of the massive\nArk with its red velvet curtain. And how bravely he glared over his\nblue glasses at the two Aarons girls who were whispering and giggling\ntogether, eyes on the newcomer.\n\nSo this was what life did to you, was it? Squeezed you dry, and then\ncast you aside in your old age, a pulp, a bit of discard. Well, they'd\nnever catch her that way.\n\nUnchurchly thoughts, these. The little place was very peaceful and\nquiet, lulling one like a narcotic. The rabbi's voice had in it that\nsoothing monotony bred of years in the pulpit. Fanny found her thoughts\nstraying back to the busy, bright little store on Elm Street, then\nforward, to the Haynes-Cooper plant and the fight that was before her.\nThere settled about her mouth a certain grim line that sat strangely on\nso young a face. The service marched on. There came the organ prelude\nthat announced the mourners' prayer. Then Rabbi Thalmann began to intone\nthe Kaddish. Fanny rose, prayer book in hand. At that Clarence Heyl\nrose too, hurriedly, as one unaccustomed to the service, and stood\nwith unbowed head, looking at the rabbi interestedly, thoughtfully,\nreverently. The two stood alone. Death had been kind to Congregation\nEmanu-el this year. The prayer ended. Fanny winked the tears from\nher eyes, almost wrathfully. She sat down, and there swept over her a\nfeeling of finality. It was like the closing of Book One in a volume\nmade up of three parts.\n\nShe said to herself: “Winnebago is ended, and my life here. How\ninteresting that I should know that, and feel it. It is like the first\nmovement in one of the concertos Theodore was forever playing. Now for\nthe second movement! It's got to be lively. Fortissimo! Presto!”\n\nFor so clever a girl as Fanny Brandeis, that was a stupid conclusion at\nwhich to arrive. How could she think it possible to shed her past\nlife, like a garment? Those impressionable years, between fourteen and\ntwenty-four, could never be cast off. She might don a new cloak to cover\nthe old dress beneath, but the old would always be there, its folds\npeeping out here and there, its outlines plainly to be seen. She might\neat of things rare, and drink of things costly, but the sturdy, stocky\nlittle girl in the made-over silk dress, who had resisted the Devil in\nWeinberg's pantry on that long-ago Day of Atonement, would always be\nthere at the feast. Myself, I confess I am tired of these stories of\nyoung women who go to the big city, there to do battle with failure, to\ngrapple with temptation, sin and discouragement. So it may as well\nbe admitted that Fanny Brandeis' story was not that of a painful\nhand-over-hand climb. She was made for success. What she attempted, she\naccomplished. That which she strove for, she won. She was too sure, too\nvital, too electric, for failure. No, Fanny Brandeis' struggle went on\ninside. And in trying to stifle it she came near making the blackest\nfailure that a woman can make. In grubbing for the pot of gold she\nalmost missed the rainbow.\n\nRabbi Thalmann raised his arms for the benediction. Fanny looked\nstraight up at him as though stamping a picture on her mind. His eyes\nwere resting gently on her--or perhaps she just fancied that he spoke to\nher alone as he began the words of the ancient closing prayer:\n\n“May the blessings of the Lord Our God rest upon you. God bless thee\nand keep thee. May He cause His countenance to shine upon thee and be\ngracious unto thee. May God lift up His countenance unto thee...”\n\nAt the last word she hurried up the aisle, and down the stairs, into the\nsoft beauty of the May night. She felt she could stand no good-bys. In\nher hotel room she busied herself with the half-packed trunks and bags.\nSo it was she altogether failed to see the dark young man who hurried\nafter her eagerly, and who was stopped by a dozen welcoming hands there\nin the temple vestibule. He swore a deep inward “Damn!” as he saw her\nstraight, slim figure disappear down the steps and around the corner,\neven while he found himself saying, politely, “Why, thanks! It's good to\nBE back.” And, “Yes, things have changed. All but the temple, and Rabbi\nThalmann.”\n\nFanny left Winnebago at eight next morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE\n\n“Mr. Fenger will see you now.” Mr. Fenger, general manager, had been\na long time about it. This heel-cooling experience was new to Fanny\nBrandeis. It had always been her privilege to keep others waiting.\nStill, she felt no resentment as she sat in Michael Fenger's outer\noffice. For as she sat there, waiting, she was getting a distinct\nimpression of this unseen man whose voice she could just hear as he\ntalked over the telephone in his inner office. It was characteristic of\nMichael Fenger that his personality reached out and touched you before\nyou came into actual contact with the man. Fanny had heard of him long\nbefore she came to Haynes-Cooper. He was the genie of that glittering\nlamp. All through the gigantic plant (she had already met department\nheads, buyers, merchandise managers) one heard his name, and felt the\nimpress of his mind:\n\n“You'll have to see Mr. Fenger about that.”\n\n“Yes,”--pointing to a new conveyor, perhaps,--“that has just been\ninstalled. It's a great help to us. Doubles our shipping-room\nefficiency. We used to use baskets, pulled by a rope. It's Mr. Fenger's\nidea.”\n\nEfficiency, efficiency, efficiency. Fenger had made it a slogan in the\nHaynes-Cooper plant long before the German nation forced it into our\neveryday vocabulary. Michael Fenger was System. He could take a muddle\nof orders, a jungle of unfilled contracts, a horde of incompetent\nworkers, and of them make a smooth-running and effective unit.\nUntangling snarls was his pastime. Esprit de corps was his shibboleth.\nOrder and management his idols. And his war-cry was “Results!”\n\nIt was eleven o'clock when Fanny came into his outer office. The very\natmosphere was vibrant with his personality. There hung about the place\nan air of repressed expectancy. The room was electrically charged with\nthe high-voltage of the man in the inner office. His secretary was a\nspare, middle-aged, anxious-looking woman in snuff-brown and spectacles;\nhis stenographer a blond young man, also spectacled and anxious; his\noffice boy a stern youth in knickers, who bore no relation to the\nslangy, gum-chewing, redheaded office boy of the comic sections.\n\nThe low-pitched, high-powered voice went on inside, talking over the\nlong-distance telephone. Fenger was the kind of man who is always\ntalking to New York when he is in Chicago, and to Chicago when he is in\nNew York. Trains with the word Limited after them were invented for\nhim and his type. A buzzer sounded. It galvanized the office boy into\ninstant action. It brought the anxious-looking stenographer to the\ndoorway, notebook in hand, ready. It sent the lean secretary out, and up\nto Fanny.\n\n“Temper,” said Fanny, to herself, “or horribly nervous and high-keyed.\nThey jump like a set of puppets on a string.”\n\nIt was then that the lean secretary had said, “Mr. Fenger will see you\nnow.”\n\nFanny was aware of a pleasant little tingle of excitement. She entered\nthe inner office.\n\nIt was characteristic of Michael Fenger that he employed no cheap\ntricks. He was not writing as Fanny Brandeis came in. He was not\ntelephoning. He was not doing anything but standing at his desk, waiting\nfor Fanny Brandeis. As she came in he looked at her, through her, and\nshe seemed to feel her mental processes laid open to him as a skilled\nsurgeon cuts through skin and flesh and fat, to lay bare the muscles\nand nerves and vital organs beneath. He put out his hand. Fanny extended\nhers. They met in a silent grip. It was like a meeting between two\nmen. Even as he indexed her, Fanny's alert mind was busy docketing,\nnumbering, cataloguing him. They had in common a certain force, a\ndriving power. Fanny seated herself opposite him, in obedience to a\ngesture. He crossed his legs comfortably and sat back in his big desk\nchair. A great-bodied man, with powerful square shoulders, a long head,\na rugged crest of a nose--the kind you see on the type of Englishman\nwho has the imagination and initiative to go to Canada, or Australia, or\nAmerica. He wore spectacles, not the fashionable horn-rimmed sort, but\nthe kind with gold ear pieces. They were becoming, and gave a certain\nhumanness to a face that otherwise would have been too rugged, too\nstrong. A man of forty-five, perhaps.\n\nHe spoke first. “You're younger than I thought.”\n\n“So are you.”\n\n“Old inside.”\n\n“So am I.”\n\nHe uncrossed his legs, leaned forward, folded his arms on the desk.\n\n“You've been through the plant, Miss Brandeis?”\n\n“Yes. Twice. Once with a regular tourist party. And once with the\nspecial guide.” “Good. Go through the plant whenever you can. Don't\nstick to your own department. It narrows one.” He paused a moment. “Did\nyou think that this opportunity to come to Haynes-Cooper, as assistant\nto the infants' wear department buyer was just a piece of luck,\naugmented by a little pulling on your part?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“It wasn't. You were carefully picked by me, and I don't expect to find\nI've made a mistake. I suppose you know very little about buying and\nselling infants' wear?”\n\n“Less than about almost any other article in the world--at least, in the\ndepartment store, or mail order world.”\n\n“I thought so. And it doesn't matter. I pretty well know your history,\nwhich means that I know your training. You're young; you're ambitious,\nyou're experienced; you're imaginative. There's no length you can't go,\nwith these. It just depends on how farsighted your mental vision is.\nNow listen, Miss Brandeis: I'm not going to talk to you in millions. The\nguides do enough of that. But you know we do buy and sell in terms of\nmillions, don't you? Well, our infants' wear department isn't helping\nto roll up the millions; and it ought to, because there are millions of\nbabies born every year, and the golden-spoon kind are in the minority.\nI've decided that that department needs a woman, your kind of woman.\nNow, as a rule, I never employ a woman when I can use a man. There's\nonly one other woman filling a really important position in the\nmerchandise end of this business. That's Ella Monahan, head of the glove\ndepartment, and she's a genius. She is a woman who is limited in every\nother respect--just average; but she knows glove materials in a way\nthat's uncanny. I'd rather have a man in her place; but I don't happen\nto know any men glove-geniuses. Tell me, what do you think of that\netching?”\n\nFanny tried--and successfully--not to show the jolt her mind had\nreceived as she turned to look at the picture to which his finger\npointed. She got up and strolled over to it, and she was glad her suit\nfitted and hung as it did in the back.\n\n“I don't like it particularly. I like it less than any other etching you\nhave here.” The walls were hung with them. “Of course you understand I\nknow nothing about them. But it's too flowery, isn't it, to be good?\nToo many lines. Like a writer who spoils his effect by using too many\nwords.”\n\nFenger came over and stood beside her, staring at the black and white\nand gray thing in its frame. “I felt that way, too.” He stared down at\nher, then. “Jew?” he asked.\n\nA breathless instant. “No,” said Fanny Brandeis.\n\nMichael Fenger smiled for the first time. Fanny Brandeis would have\ngiven everything she had, everything she hoped to be, to be able to\ntake back that monosyllable. She was gripped with horror at what she had\ndone. She had spoken almost mechanically. And yet that monosyllable must\nhave been the fruit of all these months of inward struggle and thought.\n“Now I begin to understand you,” Fenger went on. “You've decided to\nlop off all the excrescences, eh? Well, I can't say that I blame you. A\nwoman in business is handicapped enough by the very fact of her sex.” He\nstared at her again. “Too bad you're so pretty.”\n\n“I'm not!” said Fanny hotly, like a school-girl.\n\n“That's a thing that can't be argued, child. Beauty's subjective, you\nknow.”\n\n“I don't see what difference it makes, anyway.”\n\n“Oh, yes, you do.” He stopped. “Or perhaps you don't, after all. I\nforget how young you are. Well, now, Miss Brandeis, you and your woman's\nmind, and your masculine business experience and sense are to be turned\nloose on our infants' wear department. The buyer, Mr. Slosson, is going\nto resent you. Naturally. I don't know whether we'll get results from\nyou in a month, or six months or a year. Or ever. But something tells me\nwe're going to get them. You've lived in a small town most of your life.\nAnd we want that small-town viewpoint. D'you think you've got it?”\n\nFanny was on her own ground here. “If knowing the Wisconsin small-town\nwoman, and the Wisconsin farmer woman--and man too, for that\nmatter--means knowing the Oregon, and Wyoming, and Pennsylvania, and\nIowa people of the same class, then I've got it.”\n\n“Good!” Michael Fenger stood up. “I'm not going to load you down with\ninstructions, or advice. I think I'll let you grope your own way around,\nand bump your head a few times. Then you'll learn where the low places\nare. And, Miss Brandeis, remember that suggestions are welcome in this\nplant. We take suggestions all the way from the elevator starter to the\npresident.” His tone was kindly, but not hopeful.\n\nFanny was standing too, her mental eye on the door. But now she turned\nto face him squarely.\n\n“Do you mean that?”\n\n“Absolutely.”\n\n“Well, then, I've one to make. Your stock boys and stock girls walk\nmiles and miles every day, on every floor of this fifteen-story\nbuilding. I watched them yesterday, filling up the bins, carrying\norders, covering those enormous distances from one bin to another, up\none aisle and down the next, to the office, back again. Your floors are\nconcrete, or cement, or some such mixture, aren't they? I just happened\nto think of the boy who used to deliver our paper on Norris Street, in\nWinnebago, Wisconsin. He covered his route on roller skates. It saved\nhim an hour. Why don't you put roller skates on your stock boys and\ngirls?”\n\nFenger stared at her. You could almost hear that mind of his\nworking, like a thing on ball bearings. “Roller skates.” It wasn't an\nexclamation. It was a decision. He pressed a buzzer--the snuff-brown\nsecretary buzzer. “Tell Clancy I want him. Now.” He had not glanced\nup, or taken his eyes from Fanny. She was aware of feeling a little\nuncomfortable, but elated, too. She moved toward the door. Fenger stood\nat his desk. “Wait a minute.” Fanny waited. Still Fenger did not speak.\nFinally, “I suppose you know you've earned six months' salary in the\nlast five minutes.”\n\nFanny eyed him coolly. “Considering the number of your stock force, the\ntime, energy, and labor saved, including wear and tear on department\nheads and their assistants, I should say that was a conservative\nstatement.” And she nodded pleasantly, and left him.\n\nTwo days later every stock clerk in the vast plant was equipped with\nlight-weight roller skates. They made a sort of carnival of it at first.\nThere were some spills, too, going around corners, and a little too much\nhilarity. That wore off in a week. In two weeks their roller skates were\npart of them; just shop labor-savers. The report presented to Fenger was\nthis: Time and energy saved, fifty-five per cent; stock staff decreased\nby one third. The picturesqueness of it, the almost ludicrous simplicity\nof the idea appealed to the entire plant. It tickled the humor sense in\nevery one of the ten thousand employees in that vast organization. In\nthe first week of her association with Haynes-Cooper Fanny Brandeis was\nactually more widely known than men who had worked there for years. The\npresident, Nathan Haynes himself, sent for her, chuckling.\n\nNathan Haynes--but then, why stop for him? Nathan Haynes had been\nswallowed, long ago, by this monster plant that he himself had\ninnocently created. You must have visited it, this Gargantuan thing that\nsprawls its length in the very center of Chicago, the giant son of\na surprised father. It is one of the city's show places, like the\nstockyards, the Art Institute, and Field's. Fifteen years before,\na building had been erected to accommodate a prosperous mail order\nbusiness. It had been built large and roomy, with plenty of seams,\nplanned amply, it was thought, to allow the boy to grow. It would do for\ntwenty-five years, surely. In ten years Haynes-Cooper was bursting its\nseams. In twelve it was shamelessly naked, its arms and legs\nsticking out of its inadequate garments. New red brick buildings\nanother--another. Five stories added to this one, six stories to that,\na new fifteen story merchandise building.\n\nThe firm began to talk in tens of millions. Its stock became gilt-edged,\nunattainable. Lucky ones who had bought of it diffidently, discreetly,\nwith modest visions of four and a half per cent in their unimaginative\nminds, saw their dividends doubling, trebling, quadrupling, finally\nsoaring gymnastically beyond all reason. Listen to the old guide who (at\nfifteen a week) takes groups of awed visitors through the great plant.\nHow he juggles figures; how grandly they roll off his tongue. How glib\nhe is with Nathan Haynes's millions.\n\n“This, ladies and gentlemen, is our mail department. From two thousand\nto twenty-five hundred pounds of mail, comprising over one hundred\nthousand letters, are received here every day. Yes, madam, I said every\nday. About half of these letters are orders. Last year the banking\ndepartment counted one hundred and thirty millions of dollars. One\nhundred and thirty millions!” He stands there in his ill-fitting coat,\nand his star, and rubs one bony hand over the other.\n\n“Dear me!” says a lady tourist from Idaho, rather inadequately. And yet,\nnot so inadequately. What exclamation is there, please, that fits a sum\nlike one hundred and thirty millions of anything?\n\nFanny Brandeis, fresh from Winnebago, Wisconsin, slipped into the great\nscheme of things at the Haynes-Cooper plant like part of a perfectly\nplanned blue print. It was as though she had been thought out and\nshaped for this particular corner. And the reason for it was, primarily,\nWinnebago, Wisconsin. For Haynes-Cooper grew and thrived on just such\ntowns, with their surrounding farms and villages. Haynes-Cooper had\ntheir fingers on the pulse and heart of the country as did no other\nindustry. They were close, close. When rugs began to take the place of\ningrain carpets it was Haynes-Cooper who first sensed the change. Oh,\nthey had had them in New York years before, certainly. But after all,\nit isn't New York's artistic progress that shows the development of this\nnation. It is the thing they are thinking, and doing, and learning in\nBackwash, Nebraska, that marks time for these United States. There may\nbe a certain significance in the announcement that New York has dropped\nthe Russian craze and has gone in for that quaint Chinese stuff. My\ndear, it makes the loveliest hangings and decorations. When Fifth\nAvenue takes down its filet lace and eyelet embroidered curtains, and\nsubstitutes severe shantung and chaste net, there is little in the\nact to revolutionize industry, or stir the art-world. But when the\nHaynes-Cooper company, by referring to its inventory ledgers, learns\nthat it is selling more Alma Gluck than Harry Lauder records; when its\nstatistics show that Tchaikowsky is going better than Irving Berlin,\nsomething epochal is happening in the musical progress of a nation. And\nwhen the orders from Noose Gulch, Nevada, are for those plain dimity\ncurtains instead of the cheap and gaudy Nottingham atrocities, there is\nconveyed to the mind a fact of immense, of overwhelming significance.\nThe country has taken a step toward civilization and good taste.\n\nSo. You have a skeleton sketch of Haynes-Cooper, whose feelers reach the\nremotest dugout in the Yukon, the most isolated cabin in the Rockies,\nthe loneliest ranch-house in Wyoming; the Montana mining shack, the\nbleak Maine farm, the plantation in Virginia.\n\nAnd the man who had so innocently put life into this monster? A\nplumpish, kindly-faced man; a bewildered, gentle, unimaginative and\nsomewhat frightened man, fresh-cheeked, eye-glassed. In his suite of\noffices in the new Administration Building--built two years ago--marble\nand oak throughout--twelve stories, and we're adding three already;\noffices all two-toned rugs, and leather upholstery, with dim, rich,\nbrown-toned Dutch masterpieces on the walls, he sat helpless and\ndefenseless while the torrent of millions rushed, and swirled, and\nfoamed about him. I think he had fancied, fifteen years ago, that he\nwould some day be a fairly prosperous man; not rich, as riches are\ncounted nowadays, but with a comfortable number of tens of thousands\ntucked away. Two or three hundred thousand; perhaps five hundred\nthousand!--perhaps a--but, nonsense! Nonsense!\n\nAnd then the thing had started. It was as when a man idly throws a\npebble into a chasm, or shoves a bit of ice with the toe of his boot,\nand starts a snow-slide that grows as it goes. He had started this\navalanche of money, and now it rushed on of its own momentum, plunging,\nrolling, leaping, crashing, and as it swept on it gathered rocks, trees,\nstones, houses, everything that lay in its way. It was beyond the power\nof human hand to stop this tumbling, roaring slide. In the midst of it\nsat Nathan Haynes, deafened, stunned, terrified at the immensity of what\nhe had done.\n\nHe began giving away huge sums, incredible sums. It piled up faster than\nhe could give it away. And so he sat there in the office hung with the\ndim old masterpieces, and tried to keep simple, tried to keep sane, with\nthat austerity that only mad wealth can afford--or bitter poverty. He\ncaused the land about the plant to be laid out in sunken gardens and\nbaseball fields and tennis courts, so that one approached this monster\nof commerce through enchanted grounds, glowing with tulips and heady\nhyacinths in spring, with roses in June, blazing with salvia and\ngolden-glow and asters in autumn. There was something apologetic about\nthese grounds.\n\nThis, then, was the environment that Fanny Brandeis had chosen. On the\nface of things you would have said she had chosen well. The inspiration\nof the roller skates had not been merely a lucky flash. That idea had\nbeen part of the consistent whole. Her mind was her mother's mind raised\nto the nth power, and enhanced by the genius she was trying to crush.\nRefusing to die, it found expression in a hundred brilliant plans, of\nwhich the roller skate idea was only one.\n\nFanny had reached Chicago on Sunday. She had entered the city as a\nqueen enters her domain, authoritatively, with no fear upon her, no\ntrepidation, no doubts. She had gone at once to the Mendota Hotel,\non Michigan Avenue, up-town, away from the roar of the loop. It was a\nresidential hotel, very quiet, decidedly luxurious. She had no idea of\nmaking it her home. But she would stay there until she could find an\napartment that was small, bright, near the lake, and yet within fairly\nreasonable transportation facilities for her work. Her room was on the\nninth floor, not on the Michigan Avenue side, but east, overlooking the\nlake. She spent hours at the windows, fascinated by the stone and steel\ncity that lay just below with the incredible blue of the sail-dotted\nlake beyond, and at night, with the lights spangling the velvety\nblackness, the flaring blaze of Thirty-first Street's chop-suey\nrestaurants and moving picture houses at the right; and far, far away,\nthe red and white eye of the lighthouse winking, blinking, winking,\nblinking, the rumble and clank of a flat-wheeled Indiana avenue car, the\nsound of high laughter and a snatch of song that came faintly up to her\nfrom the speeding car of some midnight joy-riders!\n\nBut all this had to do with her other side. It had no bearing on\nHaynes-Cooper, and business. Business! That was it. She had trained\nherself for it, like an athlete. Eight hours of sleep. A cold plunge on\narising. Sane food. Long walks. There was something terrible about her\nearnestness.\n\nOn Monday she presented herself at the Haynes-Cooper plant. Monday and\nTuesday were spent in going over the great works. It was an exhausting\nprocess, but fascinating beyond belief. It was on Wednesday that she had\nbeen summoned for the talk with Michael Fenger. Thursday morning she was\nat her desk at eight-thirty. It was an obscure desk, in a dingy corner\nof the infants' wear department, the black sheep section of the great\nplant. Her very presence in that corner seemed to change it magically.\nYou must remember how young she was, how healthy, how vigorous, with the\nfreshness of the small town still upon her. It was health and youth,\nand vigor that gave that gloss to her hair (conscientious brushing too,\nperhaps), that color to her cheeks and lips, that brightness to her\neyes. But crafty art and her dramatic instinct were responsible for the\ntailored severity of her costume, for the whiteness of her blouse, the\ntrim common-sense expensiveness of her shoes and hat and gloves.\n\nSlosson, buyer and head of the department, came in at nine. Fanny rose\nto greet him. She felt a little sorry for Slosson. In her mind she\nalready knew him for a doomed man.\n\n“Well, well!”--he was the kind of person who would say, well,\nwell!--“You're bright and early, Miss--ah--”\n\n“Brandeis.”\n\n“Yes, certainly; Miss Brandeis. Well, nothing like making a good start.”\n\n“I wanted to go through the department by myself,” said Fanny. “The\nshelves and bins, and the numbering system. I see that your new\nmaternity dresses have just come in.”\n\n“Oh, yes. How do you like them?”\n\n“I think they're unnecessarily hideous, Mr. Slosson.”\n\n“My dear young lady, a plain garment is what they want. Unnoticeable.”\n\n“Unnoticeable, yes; but becoming. At such a time a woman is at her\nworst. If she can get it, she at least wants a dress that doesn't add to\nher unattractiveness.”\n\n“Let me see--you are not--ah--married, I believe, Miss Brandeis?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I am. Three children. All girls.” He passed a nervous hand over his\nhead, rumpling his hair a little. “An expensive proposition, let me tell\nyou, three girls. But there's very little I don't know about babies, as\nyou may imagine.”\n\nBut there settled over Fanny Brandeis' face the mask of hardness that\nwas so often to transform it.\n\nThe morning mail was in--the day's biggest grist, deluge of it, a flood.\nBuyer and assistant buyer never saw the actual letters, or attended to\ntheir enclosed orders. It was only the unusual letter, the complaint or\nprotest that reached their desk. Hundreds of hands downstairs sorted,\nstamped, indexed, filed, after the letter-opening machines had slit the\nenvelopes. Those letter-openers! Fanny had hung over them, enthralled.\nThe unopened envelopes were fed into them. Flip! Zip! Flip! Out! Opened!\nFaster than eye could follow. It was uncanny. It was, somehow, humorous,\nlike the clever antics of a trained dog. You could not believe that this\nlittle machine actually performed what your eyes beheld. Two years later\nthey installed the sand-paper letter-opener, marvel of simplicity.\nIt made the old machine seem cumbersome and slow. Guided by Izzy, the\nexpert, its rough tongue was capable of licking open six hundred and\nfifty letters a minute.\n\nTen minutes after the mail came in the orders were being filled; bins,\nshelves, warehouses, were emptying their contents. Up and down the\naisles went the stock clerks; into the conveyors went the bundles, down\nthe great spiral bundle chute, into the shipping room, out by mail, by\nexpress, by freight. This leghorn hat for a Nebraska country belle; a\ntombstone for a rancher's wife; a plow, brave in its red paint; coffee,\ntea, tinned fruit, bound for Alaska; lace, muslin, sheeting, toweling,\nall intended for the coarse trousseau of a Georgia bride.\n\nIt was not remarkable that Fanny Brandeis fitted into this scheme of\nthings. For years she had ministered to the wants of just this type of\nperson. The letters she saw at Haynes-Cooper's read exactly as customers\nhad worded their wants at Brandeis' Bazaar. The magnitude of the thing\nthrilled her, the endless possibilities of her own position.\n\nDuring the first two months of her work there she was as unaggressive\nas possible. She opened the very pores of her mind and absorbed every\ndetail of her department. But she said little, followed Slosson's\ninstructions in her position as assistant buyer, and suggested no\nchanges. Slosson's wrinkle of anxiety smoothed itself away, and his\nmanner became patronizingly authoritative again. Fanny seemed to have\nbecome part of the routine of the place. Fenger did not send for her.\nJune and July were insufferably hot. Fanny seemed to thrive, to expand\nlike a flower in the heat, when others wilted and shriveled. The\nspring catalogue was to be made up in October, as always, six months\nin advance. The first week in August Fanny asked for an interview with\nFenger. Slosson was to be there. At ten o'clock she entered Fenger's\ninner office. He was telephoning--something about dinner at the Union\nLeague Club. His voice was suave, his tone well modulated, his accent\ncorrect, his English faultless. And yet Fanny Brandeis, studying the\netchings on his wall, her back turned to him, smiled to herself. The\nvoice, the tone, the accent, the English, did not ring true They were\nacquired graces, exquisite imitations of the real thing. Fanny Brandeis\nknew. She was playing the same game herself. She understood this man\nnow, after two months in the Haynes-Cooper plant. These marvelous\nexamples of the etcher's art, for example. They were the struggle for\nexpression of a man whose youth had been bare of such things. His love\nfor them was much the same as that which impels the new made millionaire\nto buy rare pictures, rich hangings, tapestries, rugs, not so much\nin the desire to impress the world with his wealth as to satisfy the\ncraving for beauty, the longing to possess that which is exquisite, and\nfine, and almost unobtainable. You have seen how a woman, long denied\nluxuries, feeds her starved senses on soft silken things, on laces and\ngleaming jewels, for pure sensuous delight in their feel and look.\n\nThus Fanny mused as she eyed these treasures--grim, deft, repressed\nthings, done with that economy of line which is the test of the etcher's\nart.\n\nFenger hung up the receiver.\n\n“So it's taken you two months, Miss Brandeis. I was awfully afraid, from\nthe start you made, that you'd be back here in a week, bursting with\nideas.”\n\nFanny smiled, appreciatively. He had come very near the truth. “I had to\nuse all my self-control, that first week. After that it wasn't so hard.”\n\nFenger's eyes narrowed upon her. “Pretty sure of yourself, aren't you?”\n\n“Yes,” said Fanny. She came over to his desk.\n\n“I wish we needn't have Mr. Slosson here this morning. After all, he's\nbeen here for years, and I'm practically an upstart. He's so much older,\ntoo. I--I hate to hurt him. I wish you'd--”\n\nBut Fenger shook his head. “Slosson's due now. And he has got to take\nhis medicine. This is business, Miss Brandeis. You ought to know what\nthat means. For that matter, it may be that you haven't hit upon an\nidea. In that case, Slosson would have the laugh, wouldn't he?”\n\nSlosson entered at that moment. And there was a chip on his shoulder.\nIt was evident in the way he bristled, in the way he seated himself.\nHis fingers drummed his knees. He was like a testy, hum-ha stage father\ndealing with a willful child.\n\nFenger took out his watch.\n\n“Now, Miss Brandeis.”\n\nFanny took a chair facing the two men, and crossed her trim blue serge\nknees, and folded her hands in her lap. A deep pink glowed in her\ncheeks. Her eyes were very bright. All the Molly Brandeis in her was\nat the surface, sparkling there. And she looked almost insultingly\nyouthful.\n\n“You--you want me to talk?”\n\n“We want you to talk. We have time for just three-quarters of an hour of\nuninterrupted conversation. If you've got anything to say you ought to\nsay it in that time. Now, Miss Brandeis, what's the trouble with the\nHaynes-Cooper infants' wear department?”\n\nAnd Fanny Brandeis took a long breath\n\n“The trouble with the Haynes-Cooper infants' wear department is that it\ndoesn't understand women. There are millions of babies born every year.\nAn incredible number of them are mail order babies. I mean by that they\nare born to tired, clumsy-fingered immigrant women, to women in mills\nand factories, to women on farms, to women in remote villages. They're\nthe type who use the mail order method. I've learned this one thing\nabout that sort of woman: she may not want that baby, but either before\nor after it's born she'll starve, and save, and go without proper\nclothing, and even beg, and steal to give it clothes--clothes with\nlace on them, with ribbon on them, sheer white things. I don't know why\nthat's true, but it is. Well, we're not reaching them. Our goods are\nunattractive. They're packed and shipped unattractively. Why, all this\ndepartment needs is a little psychology--and some lace that doesn't\nlook as if it had been chopped out with an ax. It's the little, silly,\nintimate things that will reach these women. No, not silly, either.\nQuite understandable. She wants fine things for her baby, just as the\nsilver-spoon mother does. The thing we'll have to do is to give her\nsilver-spoon models at pewter prices.”\n\n“It can't be done,” said Slosson.\n\n“Now, wait a minute, Slosson,” Fenger put in, smoothly. “Miss Brandeis\nhas given us a very fair general statement. We'll have some facts. Are\nyou prepared to give us an actual working plan?”\n\n“Yes. At least, it sounds practical to me. And if it does to you--and to\nMr. Slosson--”\n\n“Humph!” snorted that gentleman, in expression of defiance, unbelief,\nand a determination not to be impressed.\n\nIt acted as a goad to Fanny. She leaned forward in her chair and talked\nstraight at the big, potent force that sat regarding her in silent\nattention.\n\n“I still say that we can copy the high-priced models in low-priced\nmaterials because, in almost every case, it isn't the material that\nmakes the expensive model; it's the line, the cut, the little trick that\ngives it style. We can get that. We've been giving them stuff that might\nhave been made by prison labor, for all the distinction it had. Then\nI think we ought to make a feature of the sanitary methods used in our\ninfants' department. Every article intended for a baby's use should be\nwrapped or boxed as it lies in the bin or on the shelf. And those bins\nought to be glassed. We would advertise that, and it would advertise\nitself. Our visitors would talk about it. This department hasn't been\ngetting a square deal in the catalogue. Not enough space. It ought to\nhave not only more catalogue space, but a catalogue all its own--the\nBaby Book. Full of pictures. Good ones. Illustrations that will make\nevery mother think her baby will look like that baby, once it is wearing\nour No. 29E798--chubby babies, curly-headed, and dimply. And the feature\nof that catalogue ought to be, not separate garments, but complete\noutfits. Outfits boxed, ready for shipping, and ranging in price all the\nway from twenty-five dollars to three-ninety-eight--”\n\n“It can't be done!” yelled Slosson. “Three-ninety-eight! Outfits!”\n\n“It can be done. I've figured it out, down to a packet of assorted size\nsafety pins. We'll call it our emergency outfit. Thirty pieces. And\nwhile we're about it, every outfit over five dollars ought to be packed\nin a pink or a pale blue pasteboard box. The outfits trimmed in pink,\npink boxes; the outfits trimmed in blue, blue boxes. In eight cases out\nof ten their letters will tell us whether it's a pink or blue baby. And\nwhen they get our package, and take out that pink or blue box, they'll\nbe as pleased as if we'd made them a present. It's the personal note--”\n\n“Personal slop!” growled Slosson. “It isn't business. It's sentimental\nslush!”\n\n“Sentimental, yes,” agreed Fanny pleasantly, “but then, we're running\nthe only sentimental department in this business. And we ought to be\ndoing it at the rate of a million and a quarter a year. If you think\nthese last suggestions sentimental, I'm afraid the next one--”\n\n“Let's have it, Miss Brandeis,” Fenger encouraged her quietly.\n\n“It's”--she flashed a mischievous smile at Slosson--“it's a mother's\nguide and helper, and adviser. A woman who'll answer questions, give\nadvice. Some one they'll write to, with a picture in their minds of a\nlarge, comfortable, motherly-looking person in gray. You know we get\nhundreds of letters asking whether they ought to order flannel bands,\nor the double-knitted kind. That sort of thing. And who's been answering\nthem? Some sixteen-year-old girl in the mailing department who doesn't\nknow a flannel band from a bootee when she sees it. We could call our\nwoman something pleasant and everydayish, like Emily Brand. Easy to\nremember. And until we can find her, I'll answer those letters myself.\nThey're important to us as well as to the woman who writes them. And\nnow, there's the matter of obstetrical outfits. Three grades, packed\nready for shipment, practical, simple, and complete. Our drug section\nhas the separate articles, but we ought to--”\n\n“Oh, lord!” groaned Slosson, and slumped disgustedly in his seat.\n\nBut Fenger got up, came over to Fanny, and put a hand on her shoulder\nfor a moment. He looked down at her. “I knew you'd do it.” He smiled\nqueerly. “Tell me, where did you learn all this?”\n\n“I don't know,” faltered Fanny happily. “Brandeis' Bazaar, perhaps. It's\njust another case of plush photograph album.”\n\n“Plush--?”\n\nFanny told him that story. Even the discomfited Slosson grinned at it.\n\nBut after ten minutes more of general discussion Slosson left. Fenger,\nwithout putting it in words, had conveyed that to him. Fanny stayed.\nThey did things that way at Haynes-Cooper. No waste. No delay. That she\nhad accomplished in two months that which ordinarily takes years was not\nsurprising. They did things that way, too, at Haynes-Cooper. Take the\ncase of Nathan Haynes himself. And Michael Fenger too who, not so many\nyears before, had been a machine-boy in a Racine woolen mill.\n\nFor my part, I confess that Fanny Brandeis begins to lose interest\nfor me. Big Business seems to dwarf the finer things in her. That\nred-cheeked, shabby little schoolgirl, absorbed in Zola and peanut\nbrittle in the Winnebago library, was infinitely more appealing than\nthis glib and capable young woman. The spitting wildcat of the street\nfight so long ago was gentler by far than this cool person who was so\ndeliberately taking his job away from Slosson. You, too, feel that way\nabout her? That is as it should be. It is the penalty they pay who,\ngiven genius, sympathy, and understanding as their birthright, trade\nthem for the tawdry trinkets money brings.\n\nPerhaps the last five minutes of that conference between Fanny and\nMichael Fenger reveals a new side, and presents something of interest.\nIt was a harrowing and unexpected five minutes.\n\nYou may remember how Michael Fenger had a way of looking at one,\nsilently. It was an intent and concentrated gaze that had the effect of\nan actual physical hold. Most people squirmed under it. Fanny, feeling\nit on her now, frowned and rose to leave.\n\n“Shall you want to talk these things over again? Of course I've only\noutlined them, roughly. You gave me so little time.”\n\nFenger, at his desk, did not answer, or turn away his gaze. A little\nblaze of wrath flamed into Fanny's face.\n\n“General manager or not,” she said, very low-voiced, “I wish\nyou wouldn't sit and glower at me like that. It's rude, and it's\ndisconcerting,” which was putting it forthrightly.\n\n“I beg your pardon!” Fenger came swiftly around the desk, and over to\nher. “I was thinking very hard. Miss Brandeis, will you dine with me\nsomewhere tonight? Then to-morrow night? But I want to talk to you.”\n\n“Here I am. Talk.”\n\n“But I want to talk to--you.”\n\nIt was then that Fanny Brandeis saved an ugly situation. For she\nlaughed, a big, wholesome, outdoors sort of laugh. She was honestly\namused.\n\n“My dear Mr. Fenger, you've been reading the murky magazines. Very bad\nfor you.”\n\nFenger was unsmiling: “Why won't you dine with me?”\n\n“Because it would be unconventional and foolish. I respect the\nconventions. They're so sensible. And because it would be unfair to you,\nand to Mrs. Fenger, and to me.”\n\n“Rot! It's you who have the murky magazine viewpoint, as you call it,\nwhen you imply--”\n\n“Now, look here, Mr. Fenger,” Fanny interrupted, quietly. “Let's be\nsquare with each other, even if we're not being square with ourselves.\nYou're the real power in this plant, because you've the brains. You\ncan make any person in this organization, or break them. That sounds\nmelodramatic, but it's true. I've got a definite life plan, and it's as\ncomplete and detailed as an engineering blue print. I don't intend to\nlet you spoil it. I've made a real start here. If you want to, I've no\ndoubt you can end it. But before you do, I want to warn you that I'll\nmake a pretty stiff fight for it. I'm no silent sufferer. I'll say\nthings. And people usually believe me when I talk.”\n\nStill the silent, concentrated gaze. With a little impatient exclamation\nFanny walked toward the door. Fenger, startlingly light and agile for\nhis great height, followed.\n\n“I'm sorry, Miss Brandeis, terribly sorry. You see, you interest me very\nmuch. Very much.”\n\n“Thanks,” dryly.\n\n“Don't go just yet. Please. I'm not a villain. Really. That is, not a\ndeliberate villain. But when I find something very fine, very intricate,\nvery fascinating and complex--like those etchings, for example--I am\nintrigued. I want it near me. I want to study it.”\n\nFanny said nothing. But she thought, “This is a dangerously clever man.\nToo clever for you. You know so little about them.” Fenger waited. Most\nwomen would have found refuge in words. The wrong words. It is only the\nstrong who can be silent when in doubt.\n\n“Perhaps you will dine with Mrs. Fenger and me at our home some evening?\nMrs. Fenger will speak to you about it.”\n\n“I'm afraid I'm usually too tired for further effort at the end of the\nday. I'm sorry----”\n\n“Some Sunday night perhaps, then. Tea.”\n\n“Thank you.” And so out, past the spare secretary, the anxious-browed\nstenographer, the academic office boy, to the hallway, the elevator, and\nfinally the refuge of her own orderly desk. Slosson was at lunch in one\nof the huge restaurants provided for employees in the building across\nthe street. She sat there, very still, for some minutes; for more\nminutes than she knew. Her hands were clasped tightly on the desk, and\nher eyes stared ahead in a puzzled, resentful, bewildered way. Something\ninside her was saying over and over again:\n\n“You lied to him on that very first day. That placed you. That stamped\nyou. Now he thinks you're rotten all the way through. You lied on the\nvery first day.”\n\nElla Monahan poked her head in at the door. The Gloves were on that\nfloor, at the far end. The two women rarely saw each other, except at\nlunch time.\n\n“Missed you at lunch,” said Ella Monahan. She was a pink-cheeked,\nbright-eyed woman of forty-one or two, prematurely gray and therefore\nexcessively young in her manner, as women often are who have grown gray\nbefore their time.\n\nFanny stood up, hurriedly. “I was just about to go.”\n\n“Try the grape pie, dear. It's delicious.” And strolled off down the\naisle that seemed to stretch endlessly ahead.\n\nFanny stood for a moment looking after her, as though meaning to call\nher back. But she must have changed her mind, because she said, “Oh,\nnonsense!” aloud. And went across to lunch. And ordered grape pie. And\nenjoyed it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN\n\nThe invitation to tea came in due time from Mrs. Fenger. A thin,\nquerulous voice over the telephone prepared one for the thin, querulous\nMrs. Fenger herself. A sallow, plaintive woman, with a misbehaving\nvalve. The valve, she confided to Fanny, made any effort dangerous. Also\nit made her susceptible to draughts. She wore over her shoulders a scarf\nthat was constantly slipping and constantly being retrieved by Michael\nFenger. The sight of this man, a physical and mental giant, performing\nthis task ever so gently and patiently, sent a little pang of pity\nthrough Fanny, as Michael Fenger knew it would. The Fengers lived in\nan apartment on the Lake Shore Drive--an apartment such as only Chicago\nboasts. A view straight across the lake, rooms huge and many-windowed,\na glass-enclosed sun-porch gay with chintz and wicker, an incredible\nnumber of bathrooms. The guests, besides Fanny, included a young pair,\nnewly married and interested solely in rents, hangings, linen closets,\nand the superiority of the Florentine over the Jacobean for dining\nroom purposes; and a very scrubbed looking, handsome, spectacled man of\nthirty-two or three who was a mechanical engineer. Fanny failed to\ncatch his name, though she learned it later. Privately, she dubbed him\nFascinating Facts, and he always remained that. His conversation was\ninvariably prefaced with, “Funny thing happened down at the works\nto-day.” The rest of it sounded like something one reads at the foot of\neach page of a loose-leaf desk calendar.\n\nAt tea there was a great deal of silver, and lace, but Fanny thought\nshe could have improved on the chicken a la king. It lacked paprika and\npersonality. Mrs. Fenger was constantly directing one or the other of\nthe neat maids in an irritating aside.\n\nAfter tea Michael Fenger showed Fanny his pictures, not boastfully, but\nas one who loves them reveals his treasures to an appreciative friend.\nHe showed her his library, too, and it was the library of a reader.\nFanny nibbled at it, hungrily. She pulled out a book here, a book\nthere, read a paragraph, skimmed a page. There was no attempt at\nclassification. Lever rubbed elbows with Spinoza; Mark Twain dug a\nfacetious thumb into Haeckel's ribs. Fanny wanted to sit down on the\nfloor, legs crossed, before the open shelves, and read, and read, and\nread. Fenger, watching the light in her face, seemed himself to take on\na certain glow, as people generally did who found this girl in sympathy\nwith them.\n\nThey were deep in book talk when Fascinating Facts strolled in, looking\naggrieved, and spoiled it with the thoroughness of one who never reads,\nand is not ashamed of it.\n\n“My word, I'm having a rotten time, Fenger,” he said, plaintively.\n“They've got a tape-measure out of your wife's sewing basket, those\ntwo in there, and they're down on their hands and knees, measuring\nsomething. It has to do with their rug, over your rug, or some such rot.\nAnd then you take Miss Brandeis and go off into the library.”\n\n“Then stay here,” said Fanny, “and talk books.”\n\n“My book's a blue-print,” admitted Fascinating Facts, cheerfully.\n“I never get time to read. There's enough fiction, and romance, and\nadventure in my job to give me all the thrill I want. Why, just last\nTuesday--no, Thursday it was--down at the works----”\n\nBetween Fanny and Fenger there flashed a look made up of dismay, and\namusement, and secret sympathy. It was a look that said, “We both see\nthe humor of this. Most people wouldn't. Our angle is the same.” Such a\nglance jumps the gap between acquaintance and friendship that whole days\nof spoken conversation cannot cover.\n\n“Cigar?” asked Fenger, hoping to stay the flood.\n\n“No, thanks. Say, Fenger, would there be a row if I smoked my pipe?”\n\n“That black one? With the smell?”\n\n“The black one, yes.”\n\n“There would.” Fenger glanced in toward his wife, and smiled, dryly.\nFascinating Facts took his hand out of his pocket, regretfully.\n\n“Wouldn't it sour a fellow on marriage! Wouldn't it! First those two\nin there, with their damned linen closets, and their rugs--I beg your\npardon, Miss Brandeis! And now your missus objects to my pipe. You\nwouldn't treat me like that, would you, Miss Brandeis?”\n\nThere was about him something that appealed--something boyish and\nlikeable.\n\n“No, I wouldn't. I'd let you smoke a nargileh, if you wanted to,\nsurrounded by rolls of blue prints.”\n\n“I knew it. I'm going to drive you home for that.”\n\nAnd he did, in his trim little roadster. It is a fairy road at night,\nthat lake drive between the north and south sides. Even the Rush street\nbridge cannot quite spoil it. Fanny sat back luxuriously and let the\nsoft splendor of the late August night enfold her. She was intelligently\nmonosyllabic, while Fascinating Facts talked. At the door of her\napartment house (she had left the Mendota weeks before) Fascinating\nFacts surprised her.\n\n“I--I'd like to see you again, Miss Brandeis. If you'll let me.”\n\n“I'm so busy,” faltered Fanny. Then it came to her that perhaps he did\nnot know. “I'm with Haynes-Cooper, you know. Assistant buyer in the\ninfants' wear department.”\n\n“Yes, I know. I suppose a girl like you couldn't be interested in seeing\na chap like me again, but I thought maybe----”\n\n“But I would,” interrupted Fanny, impulsively. “Indeed I would.”\n\n“Really! Perhaps you'll drive, some evening. Over to the Bismarck\nGardens, or somewhere. It would rest you.”\n\n“I'm sure it would. Suppose you telephone me.”\n\nThat was her honest, forthright, Winnebago Wisconsin self talking.\nBut up in her apartment the other Fanny Brandeis, the calculating,\nambitious, determined woman, said: “Now why did I say that! I never want\nto see the boy again.\n\n“Use him. Experiment with him. Evidently men are going to enter into\nthis thing. Michael Fenger has, already. And now this boy. Why not try\ncertain tests with them as we used to follow certain formulae in the\nchemistry laboratory at high school? This compound, that compound, what\nreaction? Then, when the time comes to apply your knowledge, you'll\nknow.”\n\nWhich shows how ignorant she was of this dangerous phase of her\nexperiment. If she had not been, she must have known that these were not\nchemicals, but explosives with which she proposed to play.\n\nThe trouble was that Fanny Brandeis, the creative, was not being fed.\nAnd the creative fire requires fuel. Fanny Brandeis fed on people, not\nthings. And her work at Haynes-Cooper was all with inanimate objects.\nThe three months since her coming to Chicago had been crowded and\neventful. Haynes-Cooper claimed every ounce of her energy, every atom\nof her wit and resourcefulness. In return it gave--salary. Not too much\nsalary. That would come later, perhaps. Unfortunately, Fanny Brandeis\ndid not thrive on that kind of fare. She needed people. She craved\ncontact. All these millions whom she served--these unseen, unheard men\nand women, and children--she wanted to see them. She wanted to touch\nthem. She wanted to talk with them. It was as though a lover of the\ndrama, eager to see his favorite actress in her greatest part, were to\nfind himself viewing her in a badly constructed film play.\n\nSo Fanny Brandeis took to prowling. There are people who have a penchant\nfor cities--more than that, a talent for them, a gift of sensing\nthem, of feeling their rhythm and pulse-beats, as others have a highly\ndeveloped music sense, or color reaction. It is a thing that cannot\nbe acquired. In Fanny Brandeis there was this abnormal response to the\ncolor and tone of any city. And Chicago was a huge, polyglot orchestra,\nmade up of players in every possible sort of bizarre costume, performing\non every known instrument, leaderless, terrifyingly discordant, yet with\nan occasional strain, exquisite and poignant, to be heard through the\nclamor and din.\n\nA walk along State street (the wrong side) or Michigan avenue at five,\nor through one of the city's foreign quarters, or along the lake front\nat dusk, stimulated her like strong wine. She was drunk with it. And all\nthe time she would say to herself, little blind fool that she was:\n\n“Don't let it get you. Look at it, but don't think about it. Don't let\nthe human end of it touch you. There's nothing in it.”\n\nAnd meanwhile she was feasting on those faces in the crowds. Those faces\nin the crowds! They seemed to leap out at her. They called to her. So\nshe sketched them, telling herself that she did it by way of relaxation,\nand diversion. One afternoon she left her desk early, and perched\nherself on one of the marble benches that lined the sunken garden just\nacross from the main group of Haynes-Cooper buildings. She wanted to see\nwhat happened when those great buildings emptied. Even her imagination\ndid not meet the actuality. At 5:30 the streets about the plant were\nempty, except for an occasional passerby. At 5:31 there trickled\ndown the broad steps of building after building thin dark streams of\nhumanity, like the first slow line of lava that crawls down the side of\nan erupting volcano. The trickle broadened into a stream, spread into\na flood, became a torrent that inundated the streets, the sidewalks,\nfilling every nook and crevice, a moving mass. Ten thousand people! A\ncity! Fanny found herself shaking with excitement, and something like\nterror at the immensity of it. She tried to get a picture of it, a\nsketch, with the gleaming windows of the red brick buildings as a\nbackground. Amazingly enough, she succeeded in doing it. That was\nbecause she tried for broad effects, and relied on one bit of detail for\nher story. It was the face of a girl--a very tired and tawdry girl, of\nsixteen, perhaps. On her face the look that the day's work had stamped\nthere was being wiped gently away by another look; a look that said\nrelease, and a sweetheart, and an evening at the movies. Fanny, in some\nmiraculous way, got it.\n\nShe prowled in the Ghetto, and sketched those patient Jewish faces,\noften grotesque, sometimes repulsive, always mobile. She wandered down\nSouth Clark street, flaring with purple-white arc-lights, and looked in\nat its windows that displayed a pawnbroker's glittering wares, or, just\nnext door, a flat-topped stove over which a white-capped magician whose\nface smacked of the galley, performed deft tricks with a pancake turner.\n“Southern chicken dinner,” a lying sign read, “with waffles and real\nmaple syrup, 35 cents each.” Past these windows promenaded the Clark\nstreet women, hard-eyed, high-heeled, aigretted; on the street corners\nloafed the Clark street men, blue-shaven, wearing checked suits, soiled\nfaun-topped shoes, and diamond scarf pins. And even as she watched them,\nfascinated, they vanished. Clark street changed overnight, and became a\nbusiness thoroughfare, lined with stately office buildings, boasting\nmarble and gold-leaf banks, filled with hurrying clerks, stenographers,\nand prosperous bond salesmen. It was like a sporting man who, thriving\nin middle age, endeavors to live down his shady past.\n\nFanny discovered Cottage Grove avenue, and Halsted street, and\nJefferson, and South State, where she should never have walked. There\nis an ugliness about Chicago's ugly streets that, for sheer, naked\nbrutality, is equaled nowhere in the world. London has its foul streets,\nsmoke-blackened, sinister. But they are ugly as crime is ugly--and as\nfascinating. It is like the ugliness of an old hag who has lived a life,\nand who could tell you strange tales, if she would. Walking through them\nyou think of Fagin, of Children of the Ghetto, of Tales of Mean Streets.\nNaples is honeycombed with narrow, teeming alleys, grimed with the\nsediment of centuries, colored like old Stilton, and smelling much\nworse. But where is there another Cottage Grove avenue! Sylvan misnomer!\nA hideous street, and sordid. A street of flat-wheeled cars, of\ndelicatessen shops and moving picture houses, of clanging bells, of\nfrowsy women, of men who dart around corners with pitchers, their coat\ncollars turned up to hide the absence of linen. One day Fanny found\nherself at Fifty-first street, and there before her lay Washington Park,\nwith its gracious meadow, its Italian garden, its rose walk, its lagoon,\nand drooping willows. But then, that was Chicago. All contrast. The\nIllinois Central railroad puffed contemptuous cinders into the great\nblue lake. And almost in the shadow of the City Hall nestled Bath-House\nJohn's groggery.\n\nMichigan Avenue fascinated her most. Here was a street developing before\none's eyes. To walk on it was like being present at a birth. It is one\nof the few streets in the world. New York has two, Paris a hundred,\nLondon none, Vienna one. Berlin, before the war, knew that no one walked\nUnter den Linden but American tourists and German shopkeepers from the\nprovinces, with their fat wives. But this Michigan Boulevard, unfinished\nas Chicago itself, shifting and changing daily, still manages to take on\na certain form and rugged beauty. It has about it a gracious breadth. As\nyou turn into it from the crash and thunder of Wabash there comes to you\na sense of peace. That's the sweep of it, and the lake just beyond, for\nMichigan avenue is a one-side street. It's west side is a sheer mountain\nwall of office buildings, clubs, and hotels, whose ground floors are\nfascinating with specialty shops. A milliner tantalizes the passer-by\nwith a single hat stuck knowingly on a carved stick. An art store shows\ntwo etchings, and a vase. A jeweler's window holds square blobs of\nemeralds, on velvet, and perhaps a gold mesh bag, sprawling limp and\ninvertebrate, or a diamond and platinum la valliere, chastely barbaric.\nPast these windows, from Randolph to Twelfth surges the crowd: matinee\ngirls, all white fox, and giggles and orchids; wise-eyed saleswomen from\nthe smart specialty shops, dressed in next week's mode; art students,\nhugging their precious flat packages under their arms; immigrants,\nin corduroys and shawls, just landed at the Twelfth street station;\nsightseeing families, dazed and weary, from Kansas; tailored and sabled\nLake Shore Drive dwellers; convention delegates spilling out of the\nAuditorium hotel, red-faced, hoarse, with satin badges pinned on their\ncoats, and their hats (the wrong kind) stuck far back on their heads;\nmusic students to whom Michigan Avenue means the Fine Arts Building.\nThere you have the west side. But just across the street the walk is\nas deserted as though a pestilence lurked there. Here the Art Institute\nrears its smoke-blackened face, and Grant Park's greenery struggles\nbravely against the poisonous breath of the Illinois Central engines.\n\nJust below Twelfth street block after block shows the solid plate glass\nof the automobile shops, their glittering wares displayed against an\nabsurd background of oriental rugs, Tiffany lamps, potted plants, and\nmahogany. In the windows pose the salesmen, no less sleek and glittering\nthan their wares. Just below these, for a block or two, rows of sinister\nlooking houses, fallen into decay, with slatternly women lolling\nat their windows, and gas jets flaring blue in dim hallways. Below\nEighteenth still another change, where the fat stone mansions of\nChicago's old families (save the mark!) hide their diminished heads\nbehind signs that read:\n\n“Marguerite. Robes et Manteaux.” And, “Smolkin. Tailor.”\n\nNow, you know that women buyers for mail order houses do not spend their\nSaturday afternoons and Sundays thus, prowling about a city's streets.\nFanny Brandeis knew it too, in her heart. She knew that the Ella\nMonahans of her world spent their holidays in stayless relaxation,\nmanicuring, mending a bit, skimming the Sunday papers, massaging\ncrows'-feet somewhat futilely. She knew that women buyers do not, as a\nrule, catch their breath with delight at sight of the pock-marked old\nField Columbian museum in Jackson Park, softened and beautified by the\nkindly gray chiffon of the lake mist, and tinted by the rouge of the\nsunset glow, so that it is a thing of spectral loveliness. Successful\nmercantile women, seeing the furnace glare of the South Chicago steel\nmills flaring a sullen red against the lowering sky, do not draw a\ndisquieting mental picture of men toiling there, naked to the waist, and\nglistening with sweat in the devouring heat of the fires.\n\nI don't know how she tricked herself. I suppose she said it was the\ncity's appeal to the country dweller, but she lied, and she knew she was\nlying. She must have known it was the spirit of Molly Brandeis in her,\nand of Molly Brandeis' mother, and of her mother's mother's mother,\ndown the centuries to Sarah; repressed women, suffering women, troubled,\npatient, nomadic women, struggling now in her for expression.\n\nAnd Fanny Brandeis went doggedly on, buying and selling infants' wear,\nand doing it expertly. Her office desk would have interested you. It was\nso likely to be littered with the most appealing bits of apparel--a\npair of tiny, crocheted bootees, pink and white; a sturdy linen smock; a\nsilken hood so small that one's doubled fist filled it.\n\nThe new catalogue was on the presses. Fanny had slaved over it, hampered\nby Slosson. Fenger had given her practically a free hand. Results would\nnot come in for many days. The Christmas trade would not tell the\ntale, for that was always a time of abnormal business. The dull season\nfollowing the holiday rush would show the real returns. Slosson was\ndiscouragement itself. His attitude was not resentful; it was pitying,\nand that frightened Fanny. She wished that he would storm a little. Then\nshe read her department catalogue proof sheets, and these reassured her.\nThey were attractive. And the new baby book had turned out very well,\nwith a colored cover that would appeal to any one who had ever been or\nseen a baby.\n\nSeptember brought a letter from Theodore. A letter from Theodore meant\njust one thing. Fanny hesitated a moment before opening it. She always\nhesitated before opening Theodore's letters. While she hesitated the old\nstruggle would rage in her.\n\n“I don't owe him anything,” the thing within her would say. “God knows I\ndon't. What have I done all my life but give, and give, and give to him!\nI'm a woman. He's a man. Let him work with his hands, as I do. He's had\nhis share. More than his share.”\n\nNevertheless she had sent him one thousand of the six thousand her\nmother had bequeathed to her. She didn't want to do it. She fought doing\nit. But she did it.\n\nNow, as she held this last letter in her hands, and stared at the\nBavarian stamp, she said to herself:\n\n“He wants something. Money. If I send him some I can't have that new\ntailor suit, or the furs. And I need them. I'm going to have them.”\n\nShe tore open the letter.\n\n“Dear Old Fan:\n\n“Olga and I are back in Munich, as you see. I think we'll be here all\nwinter, though Olga hates it. She says it isn't lustig. Well, it isn't\nVienna, but I think there's a chance for a class here of American\npupils. Munich's swarming with Americans--whole families who come here\nto live for a year or two. I think I might get together a very decent\nclass, backed by Auer's recommendations. Teaching! Good God, how I hate\nit! But Auer is planning a series of twenty concerts for me. They ought\nto be a success, if slaving can do it. I worked six hours a day all\nsummer. I wanted to spend the summer--most of it, that is--in Holzhausen\nAm Ammersee, which is a little village, or artist's colony in the\nvalley, an hour's ride from here, and within sight of the Bavarian Alps.\nWe had Kurt Stein's little villa for almost nothing. But Olga was bored,\nand she wasn't well, poor girl, so we went to Interlaken and it was\nawful. And that brings me to what I want to tell you.\n\n“There's going to be a baby. No use saying I'm glad, because I'm not,\nand neither is Olga. About February, I think. Olga has been simply\nwretched, but the doctor says she'll feel better from now on. The truth\nof it is she needs a lot of things and I can't give them to her. I told\nyou I'd been working on this concerto of mine. Sometimes I think it's\nthe real thing, if only I could get the leisure and the peace of mind\nI need to work on it. You don't know what it means to be eaten up with\nambition and to be handicapped.”\n\n“Oh, don't I!” said Fanny Brandeis, between her teeth, and crumpled the\nletter in her strong fingers. “Don't I!” She got up from her chair and\nbegan to walk up and down her little office, up and down. A man often\nworks off his feelings thus; a woman rarely. Fenger, who had not been\ntwice in her office since her coming to the Haynes-Cooper plant, chose\nthis moment to visit her, his hands full of papers, his head full of\nplans. He sensed something wrong at once, as a highly organized human\ninstrument responds to a similarly constructed one.\n\n“What's wrong, girl?”\n\n“Everything. And don't call me girl.”\n\nFenger saw the letter crushed in her hand.\n\n“Brother?” She had told him about Theodore and he had been tremendously\ninterested.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Money again, I suppose?”\n\n“Yes, but----”\n\n“You know your salary's going up, after Christmas.”\n\n“Catalogue or no catalogue?”\n\n“Catalogue or no catalogue.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because you've earned it.”\n\nFanny faced him squarely. “I know that Haynes-Cooper isn't exactly a\nphilanthropic institution. A salary raise here usually means a battle.\nI've only been here three months.” Fenger seated himself in the chair\nbeside her desk and ran a cool finger through the sheaf of papers in his\nhand. “My dear girl--I beg your pardon. I forgot. My good woman\nthen--if you like that better--you've transfused red blood into a dying\ndepartment. It may suffer a relapse after Christmas, but I don't think\nso. That's why you're getting more money, and not because I happen to be\ntremendously interested in you, personally.”\n\nFanny's face flamed scarlet. “I didn't mean that.”\n\n“Yes you did. Here are those comparative lists you sent me. If I didn't\nknow Slosson to be as honest as Old Dog Tray I'd think he had been\nselling us to the manufacturers. No wonder this department hasn't paid.\nHe's been giving 'em top prices for shoddy. Now what's this new plan of\nyours?”\n\nIn an instant Fanny forgot about Theodore, the new winter suit and furs,\neverything but the idea that was clamoring to be born. She sat at her\ndesk, her fingers folding and unfolding a bit of paper, her face all\nlight and animation as she talked.\n\n“My idea is to have a person known as a selector for each important\ndepartment. It would mean a boiling down of the products of every\nmanufacturer we deal with, and skimming the cream off the top. As it is\nnow a department buyer has to do the selecting and buying too. He can't\ndo both and get results. We ought to set aside an entire floor for the\ndisplay of manufacturers' samples. The selector would make his choice\namong these, six months in advance of the season. The selector would\ngo to the eastern markets too, of course. Not to buy. Merely to select.\nThen, with the line chosen as far as style, quality, and value\nis concerned, the buyer would be free to deal directly with the\nmanufacturer as to quantity, time, and all that. You know as well as I\nthat that's enough of a job for any one person, with the labor situation\nwhat it is. He wouldn't need to bother about styles or colors, or any of\nthat. It would all have been done for him. The selector would have the\nreal responsibility. Don't you see the simplicity of it, and the way it\nwould grease the entire machinery?”\n\nSomething very like jealousy came into Michael Fenger's face as he\nlooked at her. But it was gone in an instant. “Gad! You'll have my job\naway from me in two years. You're a super-woman, do you know that?”\n\n“Super nothing! It's just a perfectly good idea, founded on common sense\nand economy.”\n\n“M-m-m, but that's all Columbus had in mind when he started out to find\na short cut to India.”\n\nFanny laughed out at that. “Yes, but see where he landed!”\n\nBut Fenger was serious. “We'll have to have a meeting on this. Are you\nprepared to go into detail on it, before Mr. Haynes and the two Coopers,\nat a real meeting in a real mahogany directors' room? Wednesday, say?”\n\n“I think so.”\n\nFenger got up. “Look here, Miss Brandeis. You need a day in the country.\nWhy don't you run up to your home town over Sunday? Wisconsin, wasn't\nit?”\n\n“Oh, no! No. I mean yes it was Wisconsin, but no I don't want to go.”\n\n“Then let me send you my car.”\n\n“Car! No, thanks. That's not my idea of the country.”\n\n“It was just a suggestion. What do you call going to the country, then?”\n\n“Tramping all day, and getting lost, if possible. Lying down under\na tree for hours, and letting the ants amble over you. Dreaming. And\ncoming back tired, hungry, dusty, and refreshed.”\n\n“It sounds awfully uncomfortable. But I wish you'd try it, this week.”\n\n“Do I look such a wreck?” Fanny demanded, rather pettishly.\n\n“You!” Fenger's voice was vibrant. “You're the most splendidly alive\nlooking woman I ever saw. When you came into my office that first day\nyou seemed to spark with health, and repressed energy, and electricity,\nso that you radiated them. People who can do that, stimulate. That's\nwhat you are to me--a stimulant.”\n\nWhat can one do with a man who talks like that? After all, what he said\nwas harmless enough. His tone was quietly sincere. One can't resent an\nexpression of the eyes. Then, too, just as she made up her mind to be\nangry she remembered the limp and querulous Mrs. Fenger, and the valve\nand the scarf. And her anger became pity. There flashed back to her\nthe illuminating bit of conversation with which Fascinating Facts had\nregaled her on the homeward drive that night of the tea.\n\n“Nice chap, Fenger. And a wiz in business. Get's a king's salary; Must\nbe hell for a man to be tied, hand and foot, the way he is.”\n\n“Tied?”\n\n“Mrs. Fenger's a semi-invalid. At that I don't believe she's as helpless\nas she seems. I think she just holds him by that shawl of hers, that's\nforever slipping. You know he was a machine boy in her father's woolen\nmill. She met him after he'd worked his way up to an office job. He has\nforged ahead like a locomotive ever since.”\n\nThat had been their conversation, gossipy, but tremendously enlightening\nfor Fanny. She looked up at him now.\n\n“Thanks for the vacation suggestion. I may go off somewhere. Just a\nlast-minute leap. It usually turns out better, that way. I'll be ready\nfor the Wednesday discussion.”\n\nShe sounded very final and busy. The crumpled letter lay on her desk.\nShe smoothed it out, and the crumple transferred itself to her forehead.\nFenger stood a moment, looking down at her. Then he turned, abruptly and\nleft the office. Fanny did not look up.\n\nThat was Friday. On Saturday her vacation took a personally conducted\nturn. She had planned to get away at noon, as most office heads did on\nSaturday, during the warm weather. When her 'phone rang at eleven she\nanswered it mechanically as does one whose telephone calls mean a row\nwith a tardy manufacturer, an argument with a merchandise man, or a\ncatalogue query from the printer's.\n\nThe name that came to her over the telephone conveyed nothing to her.\n\n“Who?” Again the name. “Heyl?” She repeated the name uncertainly. “I'm\nafraid I--O, of course! Clarence Heyl. Howdy-do.”\n\n“I want to see you,” said the voice, promptly.\n\nThere rose up in Fanny's mind a cruelly clear picture of the little,\nsallow, sniveling school boy of her girlhood. The little boy with the\nbig glasses and the shiny shoes, and the weak lungs.\n\n“Sorry,” she replied, promptly, “but I'm afraid it's impossible. I'm\nleaving the office early, and I'm swamped.” Which was a lie.\n\n“This evening?”\n\n“I rarely plan anything for the evening. Too tired, as a rule.”\n\n“Too tired to drive?”\n\n“I'm afraid so.”\n\nA brief silence. Then, “I'm coming out there to see you.”\n\n“Where? Here? The plant! That's impossible, Mr. Heyl. I'm terribly\nsorry, but I can't----”\n\n“Yes, I know. Also terribly sure that if I ever get to you it will be\nover your office boy's dead body. Well, arm him. I'm coming. Good-by.”\n\n“Wait a minute! Mr. Heyl! Clarence! Hello! Hello!”\n\nA jiggling of the hook. “Number, please?” droned the voice of the\noperator.\n\nFanny jammed the receiver down on the hook and turned to her work, lips\ncompressed, a frown forming a double cleft between her eyes.\n\nHalf an hour later he was there. Her office boy brought in his card, as\nshe had rehearsed him to do. Fanny noted that it was the wrong kind of\ncard. She would show him what happened to pushers who pestered business\nwomen during office hours.\n\n“Bring him in in twenty minutes,” she said, grimly. Her office boy (and\nslave) always took his cue from her. She hoped he wouldn't be too rude\nto Heyl, and turned back to her work again. Thirty-nine seconds later\nClarence Heyl walked in.\n\n“Hello, Fan!” he said, and had her limp hand in a grip that made her\nwince.\n\n“But I told----”\n\n“Yes, I know. But he's a crushed and broken office boy by now. I had to\nbe real harsh with him.”\n\nFanny stood up, really angry now. She looked up at Clarence Heyl, and\nher eyes were flashing. Clarence Heyl looked down at her, and his\neyes were the keenest, kindest, most gently humorous eyes she had ever\nencountered. You know that picture of Lincoln that shows us his eyes\nwith much that expression in them? That's as near as I can come to\nconveying to you the whimsical pathos in this man. They were the eyes of\na lonely little boy grown up. And they had seen much in the process.\n\nFanny felt her little blaze of anger flicker and die.\n\n“That's the girl,” said Heyl, and patted her hand. “You'll like\nme--presently. After you've forgotten about that sniveling kid you\nhated.” He stepped back a pace and threw back his coat senatorially.\n“How do I look?” he demanded.\n\n“Look?” repeated Fanny, feebly.\n\n“I've been hours preparing for this. Years! And now something tells\nme--This tie, for instance.”\n\nFanny bit her lip in a vain effort to retain her solemnity. Then she\ngave it up and giggled, frankly. “Well, since you ask me, that tie!----”\n\n“What's the matter with it?”\n\nFanny giggled again. “It's red, that's what.”\n\n“Well, what of it! Red's all right. I've always considered red one of\nour leading colors.”\n\n“But you can't wear it.”\n\n“Can't! Why can't I?”\n\n“Because you're the brunest kind of brunette. And dark people have a\nspecial curse hanging over them that makes them want to wear red.\nIt's fatal. That tie makes you look like a Mafia murderer dressed for\nbusiness.”\n\n“I knew it,” groaned Heyl. “Something told me.” He sank into a chair\nat the side of her desk, a picture of mock dejection. “And I chose it.\nDeliberately. I had black ones, and blue ones, and green ones. And I\nchose--this.” He covered his face with a shaking hand.\n\nFanny Brandeis leaned back in her chair, and laughed, and laughed, and\nlaughed. Surely she hadn't laughed like that in a year at least.\n\n“You're a madman,” she said, finally.\n\nAt that Heyl looked up with his singularly winning smile. “But\ndifferent. Concede that, Fanny. Be fair, now. Refreshingly different.”\n\n“Different,” said Fanny, “doesn't begin to cover it. Well, now you're\nhere, tell me what you're doing here.”\n\n“Seeing you.”\n\n“I mean here, in Chicago.”\n\n“So do I. I'm on my way from Winnebago to New York, and I'm in Chicago\nto see Fanny Brandeis.”\n\n“Don't expect me to believe that.”\n\nHeyl put an arm on Fanny's desk and learned forward, his face very\nearnest. “I do expect you to believe it. I expect you to believe\neverything I say to you. Not only that, I expect you not to be surprised\nat anything I say. I've done such a mass of private thinking about you\nin the last ten years that I'm likely to forget I've scarcely seen you\nin that time. Just remember, will you, that like the girl in the sob\nsong, `You made me what I am to-day?'”\n\n“I! You're being humorous again.”\n\n“Never less so in my life. Listen, Fan. That cowardly, sickly little boy\nyou fought for in the street, that day in Winnebago, showed every sign\nof growing up a cowardly, sickly man. You're the real reason for his\nnot doing so. Now, wait a minute. I was an impressionable little kid,\nI guess. Sickly ones are apt to be. I worshiped you and hated you from\nthat day. Worshiped you for the blazing, generous, whole-souled little\ndevil of a spitfire that you were. Hated you because--well, what boy\nwouldn't hate a girl who had to fight for him. Gosh! It makes me sick to\nthink of it, even now. Pasty-faced rat!”\n\n“What nonsense! I'd forgotten all about it.”\n\n“No you hadn't. Tell me, what flashed into your mind when you saw me in\nTemple that night before you left Winnebago? The truth, now.”\n\nShe learned, later, that people did not lie to him. She tried it now,\nand found herself saying, rather shamefacedly, “I thought `Why, it's\nClarence Heyl, the Cowardy-Cat!'”\n\n“There! That's why I'm here to-day. I knew you were thinking that. I\nknew it all the time I was in Colorado, growing up from a sickly kid,\nwith a bum lung, to a heap big strong man. It forced me to do things I\nwas afraid to do. It goaded me on to stunts at the very thought of which\nI'd break out in a clammy sweat. Don't you see how I'll have to turn\nhandsprings in front of you, like the school-boy in the McCutcheon\ncartoon? Don't you see how I'll have to flex my muscles--like this--to\nshow you how strong I am? I may even have to beat you, eventually. Why,\nchild, I've chummed with lions, and bears, and wolves, and everything,\nbecause of you, you little devil in the red cap! I've climbed\nunclimbable mountains. I've frozen my feet in blizzards. I've wandered\nfor days on a mountain top, lost, living on dried currants and milk\nchocolate,--and Lord! how I hate milk chocolate! I've dodged snowslides,\nand slept in trees; I've endured cold, and hunger and thirst, through\nyou. It took me years to get used to the idea of passing a timber wolf\nwithout looking around, but I learned to do it--because of you. You made\nme. They sent me to Colorado, a lonely kid, with a pretty fair chance\nof dying, and I would have, if it hadn't been for you. There! How's that\nfor a burst of speech, young woman! And wait a minute. Remember, too, my\nname was Clarence. I had that to live down.”\n\nFanny was staring at him eyes round, lips parted. “But why?” she said,\nfaintly. “Why?”\n\nHeyl smiled that singularly winning smile of his. “Since you force me to\nit, I think I'm in love with that little, warm-hearted spitfire in the\nred cap. That's why.”\n\nFanny sat forward now. She had been leaning back in her chair, her\nhands grasping its arms, her face a lovely, mobile thing, across which\nlaughter, and pity, and sympathy and surprise rippled and played. It\nhardened now, and set. She looked down at her hands, and clasped them\nin her lap, then up at him. “In that case, you can forsake the strenuous\nlife with a free conscience. You need never climb another mountain, or\nwrestle with another--er--hippopotamus. That little girl in the red cap\nis dead.”\n\n“Dead?”\n\n“Yes. She died a year ago. If the one who has taken her place were to\npass you on the street today, and see you beset by forty thieves, she'd\nnot even stop. Not she. She'd say, `Let him fight it out alone. It's\nnone of your business. You've got your own fights to handle.'”\n\n“Why--Fanny. You don't mean that, do you? What could have made her like\nthat?”\n\n“She just discovered that fighting for others didn't pay. She just\nhappened to know some one else who had done that all her life and--it\nkilled her.”\n\n“Her mother?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nA little silence. “Fanny, let's play outdoors tomorrow, will you? All\nday.”\n\nInvoluntarily Fanny glanced around the room. Papers, catalogues, files,\ndesk, chair, typewriter. “I'm afraid I've forgotten how.”\n\n“I'll teach you. You look as if you could stand a little of it.”\n\n“I must be a pretty sight. You're the second man to tell me that in two\ndays.”\n\nHeyl leaned forward a little. “That so? Who's the other one?”\n\n“Fenger, the General Manager.”\n\n“Oh! Paternal old chap, I suppose. No? Well, anyway, I don't know what\nhe had in mind, but you're going to spend Sunday at the dunes of Indiana\nwith me.”\n\n“Dunes? Of Indiana?”\n\n“There's nothing like them in the world. Literally. In September\nthat combination of yellow sand, and blue lake, and the woods beyond\nis--well, you'll see what it is. It's only a little more than an hour's\nride by train. And it will just wipe that tired look out of your face,\nFan.” He stood up. “I'll call for you tomorrow morning at eight, or\nthereabouts. That's early for Sunday, but it's going to be worth it.”\n\n“I can't. Really. Besides, I don't think I even want to. I----”\n\n“I promise not to lecture on Nature, if that's what's worrying you.” He\ntook her hand in a parting grip. “Bring some sandwiches, will you? Quite\na lot of 'em. I'll have some other stuff in my rucksack. And wear some\nclothes you don't mind wrecking. I suppose you haven't got a red tam o'\nshanter?”\n\n“Heavens, no!”\n\n“I just thought it might help to keep me humble.” He was at the door,\nand so was she, somehow, her hand still in his. “Eight o'clock. How do\nyou stand it in this place, Fan? Oh, well--I'll find that out to-morrow.\nGood-by.”\n\nFanny went back to her desk and papers. The room seemed all at once\nimpossibly stuffy, her papers and letters dry, meaningless things. In\nthe next office, separated from her by a partition half glass, half\nwood, she saw the top of Slosson's bald head as he stood up to shut\nhis old-fashioned roll-top desk. He was leaving. She looked out of the\nwindow. Ella Monahan, in hat and suit, passed and came back to poke her\nhead in the door.\n\n“Run along!” she said. “It's Saturday afternoon. You'll work overtime\nenough when the Christmas rush begins. Come on, child, and call it a\nday!”\n\nAnd Fanny gathered papers, figures, catalogue proofs into a glorious\nheap, thrust them into a drawer, locked the drawer, pushed back her\nchair, and came.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\n\nFanny told herself, before she went to bed Saturday night, that she\nhoped it would rain Sunday morning from seven to twelve. But when\nPrincess woke her at seven-thirty, as per instructions left in penciled\nscrawl on the kitchen table, she turned to the window at once, and was\nglad, somehow, to find it sun-flooded. Princess, if you're mystified,\nwas royal in name only--a biscuit-tinted lady, with a very black and\nno-account husband whose habits made it necessary for Princess to let\nherself into Fanny's four-room flat at seven every morning, and let\nherself out at eight every evening. She had an incredibly soft and\nmusical voice, had Princess, and a cooking hand. She kept Fanny mended,\nfed and comfortable, and her only cross was that Fanny's taste in\nblouses (ultimately her property) ran to the severe and tailored.\n\n“Mawnin', Miss Fanny. There's a gep'mun waitin' to see yo'.”\n\nFanny choked on a yawn. “A what!”\n\n“Gep'mun. Says yo-all goin' picnickin'. He's in the settin' room,\na-lookin' at yo' pictchah papahs. Will Ah fry yo' up a li'l chicken to\npack along? San'wiches ain't no eatin' fo' Sunday.”\n\nFanny flung back her covers, swung around to the side of the bed, and\nstood up, all, seemingly, in one sweeping movement. “Do you mean to tell\nme he's in there, now?”\n\nFrom the sitting room. “I think I ought to tell you I can hear\neverything you're saying. Say. Fanny, those sketches of yours\nare----Why, Gee Whiz! I didn't know you did that kind of thing. This one\nhere, with that girl's face in the crowd----”\n\n“For heaven's sake!” Fanny demanded, “what are you doing here at\nseven-thirty? And I don't allow people to look at those sketches. You\nsaid eight-thirty.”\n\n“I was afraid you'd change your mind, or something. Besides, it's\nnow twenty-two minutes to eight. And will you tell the lady that's a\nwonderful idea about the chicken? Only she'd better start now.”\n\nGoaded by time bulletins shouted through the closed door, Fanny found\nherself tubbed, clothed, and ready for breakfast by eight-ten. When\nshe opened the door Clarence was standing in the center of her little\nsitting room, waiting, a sheaf of loose sketches in his hand.\n\n“Say, look here! These are the real thing. Why, they're great! They get\nyou. This old geezer with the beard, selling fish and looking like one\nof the Disciples. And this. What the devil are you doing in a mail order\nhouse, or whatever it is? Tell me that! When you can draw like this!”\n\n“Good morning,” said Fanny, calmly. “And I'll tell you nothing before\nbreakfast. The one thing that interests me this moment is hot coffee.\nWill you have some breakfast? Oh, well, a second one won't hurt you.\nYou must have got up at three, or thereabouts.” She went toward the tiny\nkitchen. “Never mind, Princess. I'll wait on myself. You go on with that\nchicken.”\n\nPrincess was the kind of person who can fry a chicken, wrap it in\ncool, crisp lettuce leaves, box it, cut sandwiches, and come out of the\nprocess with an unruffled temper and an immaculate kitchen. Thanks to\nher, Fanny and Heyl found themselves on the eight fifty-three train,\nbound for the dunes.\n\nClarence swung his rucksack up to the bundle rack. He took off his cap,\nand stuffed it into his pocket. He was grinning like a schoolboy. Fanny\nturned from the window and smiled at what she saw in his face. At that\nhe gave an absurd little bounce in his place, like an overgrown child,\nand reached over and patted her hand.\n\n“I've dreamed of this for years.”\n\n“You're just fourteen, going on fifteen,” Fanny reproved him.\n\n“I know it. And it's great! Won't you be, too? Forget you're a fair\nfinancier, or whatever they call it. Forget you earn more in a month\nthan I do in six. Relax. Unbend. Loosen up. Don't assume that hardshell\nair with me. Just remember that I knew you when the frill of your\npanties showed below your skirt.”\n\n“Clarence Heyl!”\n\nBut he was leaning past her, and pointing out of the window. “See that\ncurtain of smoke off there? That's the South Chicago, and the Hammond\nand Gary steel mills. Wait till you see those smokestacks against the\nsky, and the iron scaffoldings that look like giant lacework, and the\nslag heaps, and the coal piles, and those huge, grim tanks. Gad! It's\nawful and beautiful. Like the things Pennell does.” “I came out here on\nthe street car one day,” said Fanny, quietly. “One Sunday.”\n\n“You did!” He stared at her.\n\n“It was hot, and they were all spilling out into the street. You know,\nthe women in wrappers, just blobs of flesh trying to get cool. And the\nyoung girls in their pink silk dresses and white shoes, and the boys on\nthe street corners, calling to them. Babies all over the sidewalks and\nstreets, and the men who weren't in the mills--you know how they look in\ntheir Sunday shirtsleeves, with their flat faces, and high cheekbones,\nand their great brown hands with the broken nails. Hunkies. Well, at\nfive the motor cars began whizzing by from the country roads back\nto Chicago. You have to go back that way. Just then the five o'clock\nwhistles blew and the day shift came off. There was a great army of\nthem, clumping down the road the way they do. Their shoulders were\nslack, and their lunch pails dangled, empty, and they were wet and\nreeking with sweat. The motor cars were full of wild phlox and daisies\nand spiderwort.”\n\nClarence was still turned sideways, looking at her. “Get a picture of\nit?”\n\n“Yes. I tried, at least.”\n\n“Is that the way you usually spend your Sundays?”\n\n“Well, I--I like snooping about.”\n\n“M-m,” mused Clarence. Then, “How's business, Fanny?”\n\n“Business?” You could almost feel her mind jerk back. “Oh, let's not\ntalk about business on Sunday.”\n\n“I thought so,” said Clarence, enigmatically. “Now listen to me, Fanny.”\n\n“I'll listen,” interrupted she, “if you'll talk about yourself. I\nwant to know what you're doing, and why you're going to New York. What\nbusiness can a naturalist have in New York, anyway?”\n\n“I didn't intend to be a naturalist. You can tell that by looking at me.\nBut you can't have your very nose rubbed up against trees, and rocks,\nand mountains, and snow for years and years without learning something\nabout 'em. There were whole weeks when I hadn't anything to chum with\nbut a timber-line pine and an odd assortment of mountain peaks. We just\nhad to get acquainted.”\n\n“But you're going back, aren't you? Don't they talk about the spell of\nthe mountains, or some such thing?” “They do. And they're right. And\nI've got to have them six months in the year, at least. But I'm going\nto try spending the other six in the bosom of the human race. Not only\nthat, I'm going to write about it. Writing's my job, really. At least,\nit's the thing I like best.”\n\n“Nature?”\n\n“Human nature. I went out to Colorado just a lonesome little kid with\na bum lung. The lung's all right, but I never did quite get over the\nother. Two years ago, in the mountains, I met Carl Lasker, who owns\nthe New York Star. It's said to be the greatest morning paper in the\ncountry. Lasker's a genius. And he fries the best bacon I ever tasted.\nI took him on a four-weeks' horseback trip through the mountains. We got\npretty well acquainted. At the end of it he offered me a job. You see,\nI'd never seen a chorus girl, or the Woolworth building, or a cabaret,\nor a broiled lobster, or a subway. But I was interested and curious\nabout all of them. And Lasker said, `A man who can humanize a rock, or\na tree, or a chipmunk ought to be able to make even those things seem\nhuman. You've got what they call the fresh viewpoint. New York's full of\npeople with a scum over their eyes, but a lot of them came to New York\nfrom Winnebago, or towns just like it, and you'd be surprised at the\nnumber of them who still get their home town paper. One day, when I\ncame into Lee Kohl's office, with stars, and leading men, and all that\nwaiting outside to see him, he was sitting with his feet on the desk\nreading the Sheffield, Illinois, Gazette.' You see, the thing he thinks\nI can do is to give them a picture of New York as they used to see it,\nbefore they got color blind. A column or so a day, about anything that\nhits me. How does that strike you as a job for a naturalist?”\n\n“It's a job for a human naturalist. I think you'll cover it.”\n\nIf you know the dunes, which you probably don't, you know why they did\nnot get off at Millers, with the crowd, but rode on until they were\nfree of the Sunday picnickers. Then they got off, and walked across the\ntracks, past saloons, and a few huddled houses, hideous in yellow paint,\nand on, and on down a road that seemed endless. A stretch of cinders,\nthen dust, a rather stiff little hill, a great length of yellow sand\nand--the lake! We say, the lake! like that, with an exclamation point\nafter it, because it wasn't at all the Lake Michigan that Chicagoans\nknow. This vast blue glory bore no relation to the sullen, gray, turbid\nthing that the city calls the lake. It was all the blues of which you've\never heard, and every passing cloud gave it a new shade. Sapphire. No,\ncobalt. No, that's too cold. Mediterranean. Turquoise. And the sand in\ngolden contrast. Miles of sand along the beach, and back of that the\ndunes. Now, any dictionary or Scotchman will tell you that a dune is\na hill of loose sand. But these dunes are done in American fashion,\nlavishly. Mountains of sand, as far as the eye can see, and on the top\nof them, incredibly, great pine trees that clutch at their perilous,\nshifting foothold with frantic root-toes. And behind that, still more\nincredibly, the woods, filled with wild flowers, with strange growths\nfound nowhere else in the whole land, with trees, and vines, and brush,\nand always the pungent scent of the pines. And there you have the\ndunes--blue lake, golden sand-hills, green forest, in one.\n\nFanny and Clarence stood there on the sand, in silence, two ridiculously\ndiminutive figures in that great wilderness of beauty. I wish I could\nget to you, somehow, the clear sparkle of it, the brilliance of it, and\nyet the peace of it. They stood there a long while, those two, without\nspeaking. Then Fanny shut her eyes, and I think her lower lip trembled\njust a little. And Clarence patted her hand just twice.\n\n“I thank you,” he said, “in the name of that much-abused lady known as\nNature.”\n\nSaid Fanny, “I want to scramble up to the top of one of those dunes--the\nhigh one--and just sit there.”\n\nAnd that is what they did. A poor enough Sunday, I suppose, in the minds\nof those of you who spend yours golfing at the club, or motoring along\ngrease-soaked roads that lead to a shore dinner and a ukulele band. But\nit turned Fanny Brandeis back a dozen years or more, so that she was\nagain the little girl whose heart had ached at sight of the pale rose\nand, orange of the Wisconsin winter sunsets. She forgot all about\nlayettes, and obstetrical outfits, and flannel bands, and safety pins;\nher mind was a blank in the matter of bootees, and catalogues, and our\nNo. 29E8347, and those hungry bins that always yawned for more. She\nforgot about Michael Fenger, and Theodore, and the new furs. They\nscrambled up dunes, digging into the treacherous sand with heels, toes,\nand the side of the foot, and clutching at fickle roots with frantic\nfingers. Forward a step, and back two--that's dune climbing. A\nback-breaking business, unless you're young and strong, as were these\ntwo. They explored the woods, and Heyl had a fascinating way of talking\nabout stones and shrubs and trees as if they were endowed with human\nqualities--as indeed they were for him. They found a hill-slope carpeted\nwith dwarf huckleberry plants, still bearing tiny clusters of the\nblue-black fruit. Fanny's heart was pounding, her lungs ached, her\ncheeks were scarlet, her eyes shining. Heyl, steel-muscled, took the\nhills like a chamois. Once they crossed hands atop a dune and literally\nskated down it, right, left, right, left, shrieking with laughter, and\nending in a heap at the bottom. “In the name of all that's idiotic!”\n shouted Heyl. “Silk stockings! What in thunder made you wear silk\nstockings! At the sand dunes! Gosh!”\n\nThey ate their dinner in olympic splendor, atop a dune. Heyl produced\nunexpected things from the rucksack--things that ranged all the way from\nmilk chocolate to literature, and from grape juice to cigarettes.\nThey ate ravenously, but at Heyl's thrifty suggestion they saved a few\nsandwiches for the late afternoon. It was he, too, who made a little\nbonfire of papers, crusts, and bones, as is the cleanly habit of your\ntrue woodsman. Then they stretched out, full length, in the noon sun, on\nthe warm, clean sand.\n\n“What's your best price on one-sixth doz. flannel vests?” inquired Heyl.\n\nAnd, “Oh, shut up!” said Fanny, elegantly. Heyl laughed as one who hugs\na secret.\n\n“We'll work our way down the beach,” he announced, “toward Millers.\nThere'll be northern lights to-night; did you know that? Want to stay\nand see them?”\n\n“Do I want to! I won't go home till I have.”\n\nThese were the things they did on that holiday; childish, happy, tiring\nthings, such as people do who love the outdoors.\n\nThe charm of Clarence Heyl--for he had charm--is difficult to transmit.\nHis lovableness and appeal lay in his simplicity. It was not so much\nwhat he said as in what he didn't say. He was staring unwinkingly now at\nthe sunset that had suddenly burst upon them. His were the eyes of one\naccustomed to the silent distances.\n\n“Takes your breath away, rather, doesn't it? All that color?” said\nFanny, her face toward the blaze.\n\n“Almost too obvious for my taste. I like 'em a little more subdued,\nmyself.” They were atop a dune, and he stretched himself flat on the\nsand, still keeping his bright brown eyes on lake and sky. Then he sat\nup, excitedly. “Heh, try that! Lie flat. It softens the whole thing.\nLike this. Now look at it. The lake's like molten copper flowing in.\nAnd you can see that silly sun going down in jerks, like a balloon on a\nstring.”\n\nThey lay there, silent, while the scarlet became orange, the orange\nfaded to rose, the rose to pale pink, to salmon, to mauve, to gray.\nThe first pale star came out, and the brazen lights of Gary, far to the\nnorth, defied it. Fanny sat up with a sigh and a little shiver.\n\n“Fasten up that sweater around your throat,” said Heyl. “Got a pin?”\n They munched their sandwiches, rather soggy by now, and drank the last\nof the grape juice. “We'll have a bite of hot supper in town, at a\nrestaurant that doesn't mind Sunday trampers. Come on, Fan. We'll start\ndown the beach until the northern lights begin to show.”\n\n“It's been the most accommodating day,” murmured Fanny. “Sunshine,\nsunset, northern lights, everything. If we were to demand a rainbow and\nan eclipse they'd turn those on, too.”\n\nThey started to walk down the beach in the twilight, keeping close to\nthe water's edge where the sand was moist and firm. It was hard going.\nThey plunged along arm in arm, in silence. Now and again they stopped,\nwith one accord, and looked out over the great gray expanse that lay\nbefore them, and then up at the hills and the pines etched in black\nagainst the sky. Nothing competitive here, Fanny thought, and took a\ndeep breath. She thought of to-morrow's work, with day after to-morrow's\nbiting and snapping at its heels.\n\nClarence seemed to sense her thoughts. “Doesn't this make you feel you\nwant to get away from those damned bins that you're forever feeding?\nI watched those boys for a minute, the other day, outside your office.\nJove!”\n\nFanny dug a heel into the sand, savagely. “Some days I feel that I've\ngot to walk out of the office, and down the street, without a hat, and\non, and on, walking and walking, and running now and then, till I come\nto the horizon. That's how I feel, some days.”\n\n“Then some day, Fanny, that feeling will get too strong for you, and\nyou'll do it. Now listen to me. Tuck this away in your subconscious\nmind, and leave it there until you need it. When that time comes get on\na train for Denver. From Denver take another to Estes Park. That's the\nRocky Mountains, and they're your destination, because that's where\nthe horizon lives and has its being. When you get there ask for Heyl's\nplace. They'll just hand you from one to the other, gently, until you\nget there. I may be there, but more likely I shan't. The key's in the\nmail box, tied to a string. You'll find a fire already laid, in the\nfireplace, with fat pine knots that will blaze up at the touch of a\nmatch. My books are there, along the walls. The bedding's in the cedar\nchest, and the lamps are filled. There's tinned stuff in the pantry. And\nthe mountains are there, girl, to make you clean and whole again. And\nthe pines that are nature's prophylactic brushes. And the sky. And\npeace. That sounds like a railway folder, but it's true. I know.” They\ntrudged along in silence for a little while. “Got that?”\n\n“M-m,” replied Fanny, disinterestedly, without looking at him.\n\nHeyl's jaw set. You could see the muscles show white for an instant.\nThen he said: “It has been a wonderful day, Fanny, but you haven't told\nme a thing about yourself. I'd like to know about your work. I'd like to\nknow what you're doing; what your plan is. You looked so darned\ndefinite up there in that office. Whom do you play with? And who's this\nFenger--wasn't that the name?--who saw that you looked tired?”\n\n“All right, Clancy. I'll tell you all about it,” Fanny agreed, briskly.\n\n“All right--who!”\n\n“Well, I can't call you Clarence. It doesn't fit. So just for the rest\nof the day let's make it Clancy, even if you do look like one of the\nminor Hebrew prophets, minus the beard.”\n\nAnd so she began to tell him of her work and her aims. I think that she\nhad been craving just this chance to talk. That which she told him was,\nunconsciously, a confession. She told him of Theodore and his marriage;\nof her mother's death; of her coming to Haynes-Cooper, and the changes\nshe had brought about there. She showed him the infinite possibilities\nfor advancement there. Slosson she tossed aside. Then, rather haltingly,\nshe told him of Fenger, of his business genius, his magnetic qualities,\nof his career. She even sketched a deft word-picture of the limp and\nirritating Mrs. Fenger.\n\n“Is this Fenger in love with you?” asked Heyl, startlingly.\n\nFanny recoiled at the idea with a primness that did credit to Winnebago.\n\n“Clancy! Please! He's married.”\n\n“Now don't sneak, Fanny. And don't talk like an ingenue. So far, you've\noutlined a life-plan that makes Becky Sharp look like a cooing dove. So\njust answer this straight, will you?”\n\n“Why, I suppose I attract him, as any man of his sort, with a wife like\nthat, would be attracted to a healthily alert woman, whose ideas match\nhis. And I wish you wouldn't talk to me like that. It hurts.”\n\n“I'm glad of that. I was afraid you'd passed that stage. Well now, how\nabout those sketches of yours? I suppose you know that they're as\ngood, in a crude, effective sort of way, as anything that's being done\nto-day.”\n\n“Oh, nonsense!” But then she stopped, suddenly, and put both hands on\nhis arm, and looked up at him, her face radiant in the gray twilight.\n“Do you really think they're good!”\n\n“You bet they're good. There isn't a newspaper in the country that\ncouldn't use that kind of stuff. And there aren't three people in the\ncountry who can do it. It isn't a case of being able to draw. It's being\nable to see life in a peculiar light, and to throw that light so that\nothers get the glow. Those sketches I saw this morning are life, served\nup raw. That's your gift, Fanny. Why the devil don't you use it!”\n\nBut Fanny had got herself in hand again. “It isn't a gift,” she said,\nlightly. “It's just a little knack that amuses me. There's no money in\nit. Besides, it's too late now. One's got to do a thing superlatively,\nnowadays, to be recognized. I don't draw superlatively, but I do handle\ninfants' wear better than any woman I know. In two more years I'll be\ngetting ten thousand a year at Haynes-Cooper. In five years----”\n\n“Then what?”\n\nFanny's hands became fists, gripping the power she craved. “Then I shall\nhave arrived. I shall be able to see the great and beautiful things of\nthis world, and mingle with the people who possess them.”\n\n“When you might be making them yourself, you little fool. Don't glare at\nme like that. I tell you that those pictures are the real expression\nof you. That's why you turn to them as relief from the shop grind. You\ncan't help doing them. They're you.”\n\n“I can stop if I want to. They amuse me, that's all.”\n\n“You can't stop. It's in your blood. It's the Jew in you.”\n\n“The----Here, I'll show you. I won't do another sketch for a year. I'll\nprove to you that my ancestors' religion doesn't influence my work, or\nmy play.”\n\n“Dear, you can't prove that, because the contrary has been proven long\nago. You yourself proved it when you did that sketch of the old fish\nvender in the Ghetto. The one with the beard. It took a thousand years\nof suffering and persecution and faith to stamp that look on his face,\nand it took a thousand years to breed in you the genius to see it, and\nput it down on paper. Fan, did you ever read Fishberg's book?”\n\n“No,” said Fanny, low-voiced.\n\n“Sometime, when you can snatch a moment from the fascinations of the\nmail order catalogue, read it. Fishberg says--I wish I could remember\nhis exact words--`It isn't the body that marks the Jew. It's his Soul.\nThe type is not anthropological, or physical; it's social or psychic. It\nisn't the complexion, the nose, the lips, the head. It's his Soul which\nbetrays his faith. Centuries of Ghetto confinement, ostracism, ceaseless\nsuffering, have produced a psychic type. The thing that is stamped on\nthe Soul seeps through the veins and works its way magically to the\nface----'”\n\n“But I don't want to talk about souls! Please! You're spoiling a\nwonderful day.”\n\n“And you're spoiling a wonderful life. I don't object to this driving\nambition in you. I don't say that you're wrong in wanting to make a\nplace for yourself in the world. But don't expect me to stand by and let\nyou trample over your own immortal soul to get there. Your head is busy\nenough on this infants' wear job, but how about the rest of you--how\nabout You? What do you suppose all those years of work, and suppression,\nand self-denial, and beauty-hunger there in Winnebago were meant for!\nNot to develop the mail order business. They were given you so that you\nmight recognize hunger, and suppression, and self-denial in others. The\nlight in the face of that girl in the crowd pouring out of the plant.\nWhat's that but the reflection of the light in you! I tell you, Fanny,\nwe Jews have got a money-grubbing, loud-talking, diamond-studded,\nget-there-at-any-price reputation, and perhaps we deserve it. But every\nnow and then, out of the mass of us, one lifts his head and stands\nerect, and the great white light is in his face. And that person has\nsuffered, for suffering breeds genius. It expands the soul just as\nover-prosperity shrivels it. You see it all the way from Lew Fields to\nSarah Bernhardt; from Mendelssohn to Irving Berlin; from Mischa Elman\nto Charlie Chaplin. You were a person set apart in Winnebago. Instead of\nthanking your God for that, you set out to be something you aren't. No,\nit's worse than that. You're trying not to be what you are. And it's\ngoing to do for you.”\n\n“Stop!” cried Fanny. “My head's whirling. It sounds like something out\nof `Alice in Wonderland.'”\n\n“And you,” retorted Heyl, “sound like some one who's afraid to talk or\nthink about herself. You're suppressing the thing that is you. You're\ncutting yourself off from your own people--a dramatic, impulsive,\nemotional people. By doing those things you're killing the goose that\nlays the golden egg. What's that old copy-book line? `To thine own self\nbe true,' and the rest of it.”\n\n“Yes; like Theodore, for example,” sneered Fanny.\n\nAt which unpleasant point Nature kindly supplied a diversion. Across\nthe black sky there shot two luminous shafts of lights. Northern lights,\npale sisters of the chromatic glory one sees in the far north, but still\nweirdly beautiful. Fanny and Heyl stopped short, faces upturned. The\nghostly radiance wavered, expanded, glowed palely, like celestial\nsearchlights. Suddenly, from the tip of each shaft, there burst a\ncluster of slender, pin-point lines, like aigrettes set in a band of\nsilver. Then these slowly wavered, faded, combined to form a third and\nfourth slender shaft of light. It was like the radiance one sees in the\nold pictures of the Holy Family. Together Fanny and Heyl watched it in\nsilence until the last pale glimmer faded and was gone, and only the\nbrazen lights of Gary, far, far down the beach, cast a fiery glow\nagainst the sky.\n\nThey sighed, simultaneously. Then they laughed, each at the other.\n\n“Curtain,” said Fanny. They raced for the station, despite the sand.\nTheir car was filled with pudgy babies lying limp in parental arms;\nwith lunch baskets exuding the sickly scent of bananas; with disheveled\nvandals whose moist palms grasped bunches of wilted wild flowers. Past\nthe belching chimneys of Gary, through South Chicago, the back yard of a\nmetropolis, past Jackson Park that breathed coolly upon them, and so to\nthe city again. They looked at it with the shock that comes to eyes\nthat have rested for hours on long stretches of sand and sky and water.\nMonday, that had seemed so far away, became an actuality of to-morrow.\n\nTired as they were, they stopped at one of those frank little\nrestaurants that brighten Chicago's drab side streets. Its windows were\nfull of pans that held baked beans, all crusty and brown, and falsely\ntempting, and of baked apples swimming in a pool of syrup. These flanked\nby ketchup bottles and geometrical pyramids of golden grape-fruit.\n\nCoffee and hot roast beef sandwiches, of course, in a place like that.\n“And,” added Fanny, “one of those baked apples. Just to prove they can't\nbe as good as they look.”\n\nThey weren't, but she was too hungry to care. Not too hungry, though, to\nnote with quick eye all that the little restaurant held of interest, nor\ntoo sleepy to respond to the friendly waitress who, seeing their dusty\nboots, and the sprig of sumac stuck in Fanny's coat, said, “My, it\nmust have been swell in the country today!” as her flapping napkin\nprecipitated crumbs into their laps.\n\n“It was,” said Fanny, and smiled up at the girl with her generous,\nflashing smile. “Here's a bit of it I brought back for you.” And she\nstuck the scarlet sumac sprig into the belt of the white apron.\n\nThey finished the day incongruously by taking a taxi home, Fanny yawning\nluxuriously all the way. “Do you know,” she said, as they parted, “we've\ntalked about everything from souls to infants' wear. We're talked out.\nIt's a mercy you're going to New York. There won't be a next time.”\n\n“Young woman,” said Heyl, forcefully, “there will. That young devil\nin the red tam isn't dead. She's alive. And kicking. There's a kick in\nevery one of those Chicago sketches in your portfolio upstairs. You said\nshe wouldn't fight anybody's battles to-day. You little idiot, she's\nfighting one in each of those pictures, from the one showing that girl's\nface in the crowd, to the old chap with the fish-stall. She'll never die\nthat one. Because she's the spirit. It's the other one who's dead--and\nshe doesn't know it. But some day she'll find herself buried. And I want\nto be there to shovel on the dirt.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE\n\nFrom the first of December the floor of the Haynes-Cooper mail room\nlooked like the New York Stock Exchange, after a panic. The aisles were\ndrifts of paper against which a squad of boys struggled as vainly as a\ngang of snow-shovelers against a blizzard. The guide talked in terms of\ntons of mail, instead of thousands. And smacked his lips after it. The\nTen Thousand were working at night now, stopping for a hasty bite of\nsupper at six, then back to desk, or bin or shelf until nine, so that\nOklahoma and Minnesota might have its Christmas box in time.\n\nFanny Brandeis, working under the light of her green-shaded desk lamp,\nwondered, a little bitterly, if Christmas would ever mean anything to\nher but pressure, weariness, work. She told herself that she would not\nthink of that Christmas of one year ago. One year! As she glanced around\nthe orderly little office, and out to the stock room beyond, then back\nto her desk again, she had an odd little feeling of unreality. Surely it\nhad been not one year, but many years--a lifetime--since she had elbowed\nher way up and down those packed aisles of the busy little store in\nWinnebago--she and that brisk, alert, courageous woman.\n\n“Mrs. Brandeis, lady wants to know if you can't put this blue satin\ndress on the dark-haired doll, and the pink satin.... Well, I did tell\nher, but she said for me to ask you, anyway.”\n\n“Mis' Brandeis, this man says he paid a dollar down on a go-cart last\nmonth and he wants to pay the rest and take it home with him.”\n\nAnd then the reassuring, authoritative voice, “Coming! I'll be right\nthere.”\n\n“Coming!” That had been her whole life. Service. And now she lay so\nquietly beneath the snow of the bitter northern winter.\n\nAt that point Fanny's fist would come down hard on her desk, and the\nquick, indrawn breath of mutinous resentment would hiss through her\nteeth.\n\nShe kept away from the downtown shops and their crowds. She scowled at\nsight of the holly and mistletoe wreaths, with their crimson streamers.\nThere was something almost ludicrous in the way she shut her eyes to the\nholiday pageant all around her, and doubled and redoubled her work. It\nseemed that she had a new scheme for her department every other day, and\nevery other one was a good one.\n\nSlosson had long ago abandoned the attempt to keep up with her. He did\nnot even resent her, as he had at first. “I'm a buyer,” he said, rather\npathetically, “and a pret-ty good one, too. But I'm not a genius, and\nI never will be. And I guess you've got to be a genius, these days,\nto keep up. It used to be enough for an infants' wear buyer to\nknow muslins, cottons, woolens, silks, and embroideries. But that's\nold-fashioned now. These days, when you hire an office boy you don't ask\nhim if he can read and write. You tell him he's got to have personality,\nmagnetism, and imagination. Makes me sick!”\n\nThe Baby Book came off the presses and it was good. Even Slosson\nadmitted it, grudgingly. The cover was a sunny, breezy seashore picture,\nall blue and gold, with plump, dimpled youngsters playing, digging in\nthe sand, romping (and wearing our No. 13E1269, etc., of course). Inside\nwere displayed the complete baby outfits, with a smiling mother, and a\nchubby, crowing baby as a central picture, and each piece of each outfit\nseparately pictured. Just below this, the outfit number and price, and a\nlist of the pieces that went to make it up. From the emergency outfit at\n$3.98 to the outfit de luxe (for Haynes-Cooper patrons) at $28.50, each\ngroup was comprehensive, practical, complete. In the back of the book\nwas a personal service plea. “Use us,” it said. “We are here to assist\nyou, not only in the matter of merchandise, but with information and\nadvice. Mothers in particular are in need of such service. This book\nwill save you weariness and worry. Use us.”\n\nFanny surveyed the book with pardonable pride. But she was not\nsatisfied. “We lack style,” she said. “The practical garments are all\nright. But what we need is a little snap. That means cut and line. And\nI'm going to New York to get it.” That had always been Slosson's work.\n\nShe and Ella Monahan were to go to the eastern markets together. Ella\nMonahan went to New York regularly every three weeks. Fanny had never\nbeen east of Chicago. She envied Ella her knowledge of the New York\nwholesalers and manufacturers. Ella had dropped into Fanny's office for\na brief moment. The two women had little in common, except their work,\nbut they got on very well, and each found the other educating.\n\n“Seems to me you're putting an awful lot into this,” observed Ella\nMonahan, her wise eyes on Fanny's rather tense face.\n\n“You've got to,” replied Fanny, “to get anything out of it.”\n\n“I guess you're right,” Ella agreed, and laughed a rueful little laugh.\n“I know I've given 'em everything I've got--and a few things I didn't\nknow I had. It's a queer game--life. Now if my old father hadn't run a\ntannery in Racine, and if I hadn't run around there all the day, so that\nI got so the smell and feel of leather and hides were part of me, why,\nI'd never be buyer of gloves at Haynes-Cooper. And you----”\n\n“Brandeis' Bazaar.” And was going on, when her office boy came in with a\nname. Ella rose to go, but Fanny stopped her. “Father Fitzpatrick! Bring\nhim right in! Miss Monahan, you've got to meet him. He's”--then, as the\ngreat frame of the handsome old priest filled the doorway--“he's just\nFather Fitzpatrick. Ella Monahan.”\n\nThe white-haired Irishman, and the white-haired Irish woman clasped\nhands.\n\n“And who are you, daughter, besides being Ella Monahan?”\n\n“Buyer of gloves at Haynes-Cooper, Father.”\n\n“You don't tell me, now!” He turned to Fanny, put his two big hands\non her shoulders, and swung her around to face the light. “Hm,” he\nmurmured, noncommittally, after that.\n\n“Hm--what?” demanded Fanny. “It sounds unflattering, whatever it means.”\n “Gloves!” repeated Father Fitzpatrick, unheeding her. “Well, now, what\nd'you think of that! Millions of dollars' worth, I'll wager, in your\ntime.”\n\n“Two million and a half in my department last year,” replied Ella,\nwithout the least trace of boastfulness. One talked only in terms of\nmillions at Haynes-Cooper's.\n\n“What an age it is! When two slips of women can earn salaries that would\nmake the old kings of Ireland look like beggars.” He twinkled upon the\nolder woman. “And what a feeling it must be--independence, and all.”\n\n“I've earned my own living since I was seventeen,” said Ella Monahan.\n“I'd hate to tell you how long that is.” A murmur from the gallant\nIrishman. “Thanks, Father, for the compliment I see in your eyes. But\nwhat I mean is this: You're right about independence. It is a grand\nthing. At first. But after a while it begins to pall on you. Don't ask\nme why. I don't know. I only hope you won't think I'm a wicked woman\nwhen I say I could learn to love any man who'd hang a silver fox scarf\nand a string of pearls around my neck, and ask me if I didn't feel a\ndraft.”\n\n“Wicked! Not a bit of it, my girl. It's only natural, and\ncommendable--barrin' the pearls.”\n\n“I'd forego them,” laughed Ella, and with a parting handshake left the\ntwo alone.\n\nFather Fitzpatrick looked after her. “A smart woman, that.” He took out\nhis watch, a fat silver one. “It's eleven-thirty. My train leaves at\nfour. Now, Fanny, if you'll get on your hat, and arrange to steal an\nhour or so from this Brobdingnagian place a grand word that, my girl,\nand nearer to swearing than any word I know--I'll take you to the\nBlackstone, no less, for lunch. How's that for a poor miserable old\npriest!”\n\n“You dear, I couldn't think of it. Oh, yes, I could get away, but let's\nlunch right here at the plant, in the grill----”\n\n“Never! I couldn't. Don't ask it of me. This place scares me. I came up\nin the elevator with a crowd and a guide, and he was juggling millions,\nthat chap, the way a newsboy flips a cent. I'm but a poor parish priest,\nbut I've got my pride. We'll go to the Blackstone, which I've passed,\nhumbly, but never been in, with its rose silk shades and its window\nboxes. And we'll be waited on by velvet-footed servitors, me girl. Get\nyour hat.”\n\nFanny, protesting, but laughing, too, got it. They took the L. Michigan\navenue, as they approached it from Wabash, was wind-swept and bleak as\nonly Michigan avenue can be in December. They entered the warm radiance\nof the luxurious foyer with a little breathless rush, as wind-blown\nChicagoans generally do. The head waiter must have thought Father\nFitzpatrick a cardinal, at least, for he seated them at a window table\nthat looked out upon the icy street, with Grant Park, crusted with sooty\nsnow, just across the way, and beyond that the I. C. tracks and the\ngreat gray lake. The splendid room was all color, and perfume, and\nhumming conversation. A fountain tinkled in the center, and upon its\nwaters there floated lily pads and blossoms, weirdly rose, and mauve,\nand lavender. The tables were occupied by deliciously slim young\ngirls and very self-conscious college boys, home for the holidays, and\nmarcelled matrons, furred and aigretted. The pink in Fanny's cheeks\ndeepened. She loved luxury. She smiled and flashed at the handsome old\npriest opposite her.\n\n“You're a wastrel,” she said, “but isn't it nice!” And tasted the first\ndelicious sip of soup.\n\n“It is. For a change. Extravagance is good for all of us, now and then.”\n He glanced leisurely about the brilliant room, then out to the street,\nbleakly windswept. He leaned back and drummed a bit with his fingers on\nthe satin-smooth cloth. “Now and then. Tell me, Fanny, what would you\nsay, off-hand, was the most interesting thing you see from here? You\nused to have a trick of picking out what they call the human side. Your\nmother had it, too.”\n\nFanny, smiling, glanced about the room, her eyes unconsciously following\nthe track his had taken. About the room, and out, to the icy street.\n“The most interesting thing?” Back to the flower-scented room, with its\nmusic, and tinkle, and animation. Out again, to the street. “You see\nthat man, standing at the curb, across the street. He's sort of crouched\nagainst the lamp post. See him? Yes, there, just this side of that big\ngray car? He's all drawn up in a heap. You can feel him shivering. He\nlooks as if he were trying to crawl inside himself for warmth. Ever\nsince we came in I've noticed him staring straight across at these\nwindows where we're all sitting so grandly, lunching. I know what he's\nthinking, don't you? And I wish I didn't feel so uncomfortable, knowing\nit. I wish we hadn't ordered lobster thermidor. I wish--there! the\npoliceman's moving him on.”\n\nFather Fitzpatrick reached over and took her hand, as it lay on the\ntable, in his great grasp. “Fanny, girl, you've told me what I wanted to\nknow. Haynes-Cooper or no Haynes-Cooper, millions or no millions, your\nravines aren't choked up with ashes yet, my dear. Thank God.”\n\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\n\nFrom now on Fanny Brandeis' life became such a swift-moving thing that\nyour trilogist would have regarded her with disgust. Here was no slow\nunfolding, petal by petal. Here were two processes going on, side by\nside. Fanny, the woman of business, flourished and throve like a weed,\narrogantly flaunting its head above the timid, white flower that lay\nclose to the soil, and crept, and spread, and multiplied. Between the\ntwo the fight went on silently.\n\nFate, or Chance, or whatever it is that directs our movements, was\nforever throwing tragic or comic little life-groups in her path, and\nthen, pointing an arresting finger at her, implying, “This means you!”\n Fanny stepped over these obstructions, or walked around them, or stared\nstraight through them.\n\nShe had told herself that she would observe the first anniversary of her\nmother's death with none of those ancient customs by which your pious\nJew honors his dead. There would be no Yahrzeit light burning for\ntwenty-four hours. She would not go to Temple for Kaddish prayer. But\nthe thing was too strong for her, too anciently inbred. Her ancestors\nwould have lighted a candle, or an oil lamp. Fanny, coming home at six,\nfound herself turning on the shaded electric lamp in her hall. She went\nthrough to the kitchen.\n\n“Princess, when you come in to-morrow morning you'll find a light in the\nhall. Don't turn it off until to-morrow evening at six.”\n\n“All day long, Miss Fan! Mah sakes, wa' foh?”\n\n“It's just a religious custom.”\n\n“Didn't know yo' had no relijin, Miss Fan. Leastways, Ah nevah could\nfiggah----”\n\n“I haven't,” said Fanny, shortly. “Dinner ready soon, Princess? I'm\nstarved.”\n\nShe had entered a Jewish house of worship only once in this year. It was\nthe stately, white-columned edifice on Grand Boulevard that housed the\ncongregation presided over by the famous Kirsch. She had heard of him,\nnaturally. She was there out of curiosity, like any other newcomer to\nChicago. The beauty of the auditorium enchanted her--a magnificently\nproportioned room, and restful without being in the least gloomy.\nThen she had been interested in the congregation as it rustled in. She\nthought she had never seen so many modishly gowned women in one room\nin all her life. The men were sleekly broadclothed, but they lacked the\nwell-dressed air, somehow. The women were slimly elegant in tailor suits\nand furs. They all looked as if they had been turned out by the same\ntailor. An artist, in his line, but of limited imagination. Dr. Kirsch,\nsociologist and savant, aquiline, semi-bald, grimly satiric, sat in\nhis splendid, high-backed chair, surveying his silken flock through\nhalf-closed lids. He looked tired, and rather ill, Fanny thought, but\ndistinctly a personage. She wondered if he held them or they him. That\nrecalled to her the little Winnebago Temple and Rabbi Thalmann.\nShe remembered the frequent rudeness and open inattention of that\ncongregation. No doubt Mrs. Nathan Pereles had her counterpart here, and\nthe hypocritical Bella Weinberg, too, and the giggling Aarons girls,\nand old Ben Reitman. Here Dr. Kirsch had risen, and, coming forward, had\npaused to lean over his desk and, with an awful geniality, had looked\ndown upon two rustling, exquisitely gowned late-comers. They sank into\ntheir seats, cowed. Fanny grinned. He began his lecture something\nabout modern politics. Fanny was fascinated and resentful by turns. His\nbrilliant satire probed, cut, jabbed like a surgeon's scalpel; or he\nrailed, scolded, snarled, like a dyspeptic schoolmaster. Often he was\nin wretched taste. He mimicked, postured, sneered. But he had this\nmillionaire congregation of his in hand. Fanny found herself smiling\nup at him, delightedly. Perhaps this wasn't religion, as she had been\ntaught to look upon it, but it certainly was tonic. She told herself\nthat she would have come to the same conclusion if Kirsch had occupied a\nMethodist pulpit.\n\nThere were no Kaddish prayers in Kirsch's Temple. On the Friday\nfollowing the first anniversary of Molly Brandeis's death Fanny did not\ngo home after working hours, but took a bite of supper in a neighborhood\nrestaurant. Then she found her way to one of the orthodox Russian Jewish\nsynagogues on the west side. It was a dim, odorous, bare little place,\nthis house of worship. Fanny had never seen one like it before. She was\nherded up in the gallery, where the women sat. And when the patriarchal\nrabbi began to intone the prayer for the dead Fanny threw the gallery\ninto wild panic by rising for it--a thing that no woman is allowed to\ndo in an orthodox Jewish church. She stood, calmly, though the beshawled\nwomen to right and left of her yanked at her coat.\n\nIn January Fanny discovered New York. She went as selector for her\ndepartment. Hereafter Slosson would do only the actual buying. Styles,\nprices, and materials would be decided by her. Ella Monahan accompanied\nher, it being the time for her monthly trip. Fanny openly envied her her\nknowledge of New York's wholesale district. Ella offered to help her.\n\n“No,” Fanny had replied, “I think not, thanks. You've your own work. And\nbesides I know pretty well what I want, and where to go to get it. It's\nmaking them give it to me that will be hard.”\n\nThey went to the same hotel, and took connecting rooms. Each went her\nown way, not seeing the other from morning until night, but they often\nfound kimonoed comfort in each other's presence.\n\nFanny had spent weeks outlining her plan of attack. She had determined\nto retain the cheap grades, but to add a finer line as well. She\nrecalled those lace-bedecked bundles that the farmer women and mill\nhands had born so tenderly in their arms. Here was one direction in\nwhich they allowed extravagance free rein. As a canny business woman,\nshe would trade on her knowledge of their weakness.\n\nAt Haynes-Cooper order is never a thing to be despised by a wholesaler.\nFanny, knowing this, had made up her mind to go straight to Horn &\nUdell. Now, Horn & Udell are responsible for the bloomers your small\ndaughter wears under her play frock, in place of the troublesome and\nextravagant petticoat of the old days. It was they who introduced\nsmocked pinafores to you; and those modish patent-leather belts for\nchildren at which your grandmothers would have raised horrified hands.\nThey taught you that an inch of hand embroidery is worth a yard of cheap\nlace. And as for style, cut, line--you can tell a Horn & Udell child\nfrom among a flock of thirty.\n\nFanny, entering their office, felt much as Molly Brandeis had felt that\nJanuary many, many years before, when she had made that first terrifying\ntrip to the Chicago market. The engagement had been made days before.\nFanny never knew the shock that her youthfully expectant face gave old\nSid Udell. He turned from his desk to greet her, his polite smile of\ngreeting giving way to a look of bewilderment.\n\n“But you are not the buyer, are you, Miss Brandeis?”\n\n“No, Mr. Slosson buys.”\n\n“I thought so.”\n\n“But I select for my entire department. I decide on our styles,\nmaterials, and prices, six months in advance. Then Mr. Slosson does the\nactual bulk buying.”\n\n“Something new-fangled?” inquired Sid Udell. “Of course, we've never\nsold much to you people. Our stuff is----”\n\n“Yes, I know. But you'd like to, wouldn't you?”\n\n“Our class of goods isn't exactly suited to your wants.”\n\n“Yes, it is. Exactly. That's why I'm here. We'll be doing a business of\na million and a quarter in my department in another two years. No firm,\nnot even Horn & Udell, can afford to ignore an account like that.”\n\nSid Udell smiled a little. “You've made up your mind to that million and\na quarter, young lady?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, I've dealt with buyers for a quarter of a century or more. And\nI'd say that you're going to get it.”\n\nWhereupon Fanny began to talk. Ten minutes later Udell interrupted her\nto summon Horn, whose domain was the factory. Horn came, was introduced,\nlooked doubtful. Fanny had statistics. Fanny had arguments. She had\ndetermination. “And what we want,” she went on, in her quiet, assured\nway, “is style. The Horn & Udell clothes have chic. Now, material can't\nbe imitated successfully, but style can. Our goods lack just that.\nI could copy any model you have, turn the idea over to a cheap\nmanufacturer, and get a million just like it, at one-fifth the price.\nThat isn't a threat. It's just a business statement that you know to be\ntrue. I can sketch from memory anything I've seen once. What I want to\nknow is this: Will you make it necessary for me to do that, or will you\nundertake to furnish us with cheaper copies of your high-priced designs?\nWe could use your entire output. I know the small-town woman of the\npoorer class, and I know she'll wear a shawl in order to give her child\na cloth coat with fancy buttons and a velvet collar.”\n\nAnd Horn & Udell, whose attitude at first had been that of two seasoned\nbusiness men dealing with a precocious child, found themselves quoting\nprices to her, shipments, materials, quality, quantities. Then came the\nquestion of time.\n\n“We'll get out a special catalogue for the summer,” Fanny said. “A small\none, to start them our way. Then the big Fall catalogue will contain the\nentire line.”\n\n“That doesn't give us time!” exclaimed both men, in a breath.\n\n“But you must manage, somehow. Can't you speed up the workroom? Put on\nextra hands? It's worth it.”\n\nThey might, under normal conditions. But there was this strike-talk, its\nugly head bobbing up in a hundred places. And their goods were the kind\nthat required high-class workers. Their girls earned all the way from\ntwelve to twenty-five dollars. But Fanny knew she had driven home\nthe entering wedge. She left them after making an engagement for\nthe following day. The Horn & Udell factory was in New York's newer\nloft-building section, around Madison, Fifth avenue, and the Thirties.\nHer hotel was very near. She walked up Fifth avenue a little way, and as\nshe walked she wondered why she did not feel more elated. Her day's work\nhad exceeded her expectations. It was a brilliant January afternoon,\nwith a snap in the air that was almost western. Fifth avenue flowed up,\nflowed down, and Fanny fought the impulse to stare after every second or\nthird woman she passed. They were so invariably well-dressed. There was\nnone of the occasional shabbiness or dowdiness of Michigan Avenue. Every\nwoman seemed to have emerged fresh from the hands of masseuse and maid.\nTheir hair was coiffed to suit the angle of the hat, and the hat had\nbeen chosen to enhance the contour of the head, and the head was carried\nwith regard for the dark furs that encircled the throat. They were\namazingly well shod. Their white gloves were white. (A fact remarkable\nto any soot-haunted Chicagoan.) Their coloring rivaled the rose leaf.\nAnd nobody's nose was red.\n\n“Goodness knows I've never pretended to be a beauty,” Fanny said that\nevening, in conversation with Ella Monahan. “But I've always thought\nI had my good points. By the time I'd reached Forty-second street I\nwouldn't have given two cents for my chances of winning a cave man on a\ndesert island.”\n\nShe made up her mind that she would go back to the hotel, get a thick\ncoat, and ride outside one of those fascinating Fifth avenue 'buses. It\nstruck her as an ideal way to see this amazing street. She was back at\nher hotel in ten minutes. Ella had not yet come in. Their rooms were on\nthe tenth floor. Fanny got her coat, peered at her own reflection in\nthe mirror, sighed, shook her head, and was off down the hall toward the\nelevators. The great hall window looked toward Fifth avenue, but between\nit and the avenue rose a yellow-brick building that housed tier on\ntier of manufacturing lofts. Cloaks, suits, blouses, petticoats, hats,\ndresses--it was just such a building as Fanny had come from when she\nleft the offices of Horn & Udell. It might be their very building, for\nall she knew. She looked straight into its windows as she stood waiting\nfor the lift. And window after window showed women, sewing. They were\nsewing at machines, and at hand-work, but not as women are accustomed\nto sew, with leisurely stitches, stopping to pat a seam here, to run\na calculating eye along hem or ruffle. It was a dreadful, mechanical\nmotion, that sewing, a machine-like, relentless motion, with no waste in\nit, no pause. Fanny's mind leaped back to Winnebago, with its pleasant\nporches on which leisurely women sat stitching peacefully at a fine\nseam.\n\nWhat was it she had said to Udell? “Can't you speed up the workroom? It's\nworth it.”\n\nFanny turned abruptly from the window as the door of the bronze and\nmirrored lift opened for her. She walked over to Fifth avenue again and\nup to Forty-fifth street. Then she scrambled up the spiral stairs of a\nWashington Square 'bus. The air was crisp, clear, intoxicating. To her\nChicago eyes the buildings, the streets, the very sky looked startlingly\nfresh and new-washed. As the 'bus lurched down Fifth avenue she leaned\nover the railing to stare, fascinated, at the colorful, shifting,\nbrilliant panorama of the most amazing street in the world. Block after\nblock, as far as the eye could see, the gorgeous procession moved up,\nmoved down, and the great, gleaming motor cars crept, and crawled, and\nwrithed in and out, like nothing so much as swollen angle worms in a\nfishing can, Fanny thought. Her eye was caught by one limousine that\nstood out, even in that crush of magnificence. It was all black, as\nthough scorning to attract the eye with vulgar color, and it was lined\nwith white. Fanny thought it looked very much like Siegel & Cowan's\nhearse, back in Winnebago. In it sat a woman, all furs, and orchids,\nand complexion. She was holding up to the window a little dog with a\nwrinkled and weary face, like that of an old, old man. He was sticking\nhis little evil, eager red tongue out at the world. And he wore a very\nsmart and woolly white sweater, of the imported kind--with a monogram\ndone in black.\n\nThe traffic policeman put up his hand. The 'bus rumbled on down the\nstreet. Names that had always been remotely mythical to her now met her\neye and became realities. Maillard's. And that great red stone\ncastle was the Waldorf. Almost historic, and it looked newer than the\nsmoke-grimed Blackstone. And straight ahead--why, that must be the\nFlatiron building! It loomed up like the giant prow of an unimaginable\nship. Brentano's. The Holland House. Madison Square. Why there never was\nanything so terrifying, and beautiful, and palpitating, and exquisite\nas this Fifth avenue in the late winter afternoon, with the sky ahead a\nrosy mist, and the golden lights just beginning to spangle the gray. At\nMadison Square she decided to walk. She negotiated the 'bus steps with\nsurprising skill for a novice, and scurried along the perilous crossing\nto the opposite side. She entered Madison Square. But why hadn't O.\nHenry emphasized its beauty, instead of its squalor? It lay, a purple\npool of shadow, surrounded by the great, gleaming, many-windowed office\nbuildings, like an amethyst sunk in a circle of diamonds. “It's a\nfairyland!” Fanny told herself. “Who'd have thought a city could be so\nbeautiful!”\n\nAnd then, at her elbow, a voice said, “Oh, lady, for the lova God!”\n She turned with a jerk and looked up into the unshaven face of a great,\nblue-eyed giant who pulled off his cap and stood twisting it in his\nswollen blue fingers. “Lady, I'm cold. I'm hungry. I been sittin' here\nhours.”\n\nFanny clutched her bag a little fearfully. She looked at his huge frame.\n“Why don't you work?”\n\n“Work!” He laughed. “There ain't any. Looka this!” He turned up his\nfoot, and you saw the bare sole, blackened and horrible, and fringed,\ncomically, by the tattered leather upper.\n\n“Oh--my dear!” said Fanny. And at that the man began to cry, weakly,\nsickeningly, like a little boy.\n\n“Don't do that! Don't! Here.” She was emptying her purse, and something\ninside her was saying, “You fool, he's only a professional beggar.”\n\nAnd then the man wiped his face with his cap, and swallowed hard, and\nsaid, “I don't want all you got. I ain't holdin' you up. Just gimme\nthat. I been sittin' here, on that bench, lookin' at that sign across\nthe street. Over there. It says, `EAT.' It goes off an' on. Seemed like\nit was drivin' me crazy.”\n\nFanny thrust a crumpled five-dollar bill into his hand. And was off. She\nfairly flew along, so that it was not until she had reached Thirty-third\nstreet that she said aloud, as was her way when moved, “I don't care.\nDon't blame me. It was that miserable little beast of a dog in the white\nsweater that did it.”\n\nIt was almost seven when she reached her room. A maid, in neat black and\nwhite, was just coming out with an armful of towels.\n\n“I just brought you a couple of extra towels. We were short this\nmorning,” she said.\n\nThe room was warm, and quiet, and bright. In her bathroom, that\nglistened with blue and white tiling, were those redundant towels. Fanny\nstood in the doorway and counted them, whimsically. Four great fuzzy\nbath towels. Eight glistening hand towels. A blue and white bath rug\nhung at the side of the tub. Her telephone rang. It was Ella.\n\n“Where in the world have you been, child? I was worried about you. I\nthought you were lost in the streets of New York.”\n\n“I took a 'bus ride,” Fanny explained.\n\n“See anything of New York?”\n\n“I saw all of it,” replied Fanny. Ella laughed at that, but Fanny's face\nwas serious.\n\n“How did you make out at Horn & Udell's? Never mind, I'm coming in for a\nminute; can I?”\n\n“Please do. I need you.”\n\nA moment later Ella bounced in, fresh as to blouse, pink as to cheeks,\nher whole appearance a testimony to the revivifying effects of a warm\nbath, a brief nap, clean clothes.\n\n“Dear child, you look tired. I'm not going to stay. You get dressed and\nI'll meet you for dinner. Or do you want yours up here?”\n\n“Oh, no!”\n\n“'Phone me when you're dressed. But tell me, isn't it a wonder, this\ntown? I'll never forget my first trip here. I spent one whole evening\nstanding in front of the mirror trying to make those little spit-curls\nthe women were wearing then. I'd seen 'em on Fifth avenue, and it seemed\nI'd die if I couldn't have 'em, too. And I dabbed on rouge, and touched\nup my eyebrows. I don't know. It's a kind of a crazy feeling gets you.\nThe minute I got on the train for Chicago I washed my face and took my\nhair down and did it plain again.”\n\n“Why, that's the way I felt!” laughed Fanny. “I didn't care anything\nabout infants' wear, or Haynes-Cooper, or anything. I just wanted to be\nbeautiful, as they all were.”\n\n“Sure! It gets us all!”\n\nFanny twisted her hair into the relentless knob women assume preparatory\nto bathing. “It seems to me you have to come from Winnebago, or\nthereabouts, to get New York--really get it, I mean.”\n\n“That's so,” agreed Ella. “There's a man on the New York Star who writes\na column every day that everybody reads. If he isn't a small-town man\nthen we're both wrong.”\n\nFanny, bathward bound, turned to stare at Ella. “A column about what?”\n\n“Oh, everything. New York, mostly. Say, it's the humanest stuff. He\nsays the kind of thing we'd all say, if we knew how. Reading him is like\ngetting a letter from home. I'll bet he went to a country school and\nwore his mittens sewed to a piece of tape that ran through his coat\nsleeves.”\n\n“You're right,” said Fanny; “he did. That man's from Winnebago,\nWisconsin.”\n\n“No!”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Do you mean you know him? Honestly? What's he like?”\n\nBut Fanny had vanished. “I'm a tired business woman,” she called, above\nthe splashing that followed, “and I won't converse until I'm fed.”\n\n“But how about Horn & Udell?” demanded Ella, her mouth against the\ncrack.\n\n“Practically mine,” boasted Fanny.\n\n“You mean--landed!”\n\n“Well, hooked, at any rate, and putting up a very poor struggle.”\n\n“Why, you clever little divil, you! You'll be making me look like a\nstock girl next.”\n\nFanny did not telephone Heyl until the day she left New York. She had\ntold herself she would not telephone him at all. He had sent her his New\nYork address and telephone number months before, after that Sunday\nat the dunes. Ella Monahan had finished her work and had gone back to\nChicago four days before Fanny was ready to leave. In those four days\nFanny had scoured the city from the Palisades to Pell street. I don't\nknow how she found her way about. It was a sort of instinct with her.\nShe seemed to scent the picturesque. She never for a moment neglected\nher work. But she had found it was often impossible to see these New\nYork business men until ten--sometimes eleven--o'clock. She awoke at\nseven, a habit formed in her Winnebago days. Eight-thirty one morning\nfound her staring up at the dim vastness of the dome of the cathedral of\nSt. John the Divine. The great gray pile, mountainous, almost ominous,\nlooms up in the midst of the dingy commonplaceness of Amsterdam avenue\nand 110th street. New Yorkers do not know this, or if they know it, the\nfact does not interest them. New Yorkers do not go to stare up into the\nmurky shadows of this glorious edifice. They would if it were situate\nin Rome. Bare, crude, unfinished, chaotic, it gives rich promise of\nmagnificent fulfillment. In an age when great structures are thrown up\nto-day, to be torn down to-morrow, this slow-moving giant is at once a\nreproach and an example. Twenty-five years in building, twenty-five\nmore for completion, it has elbowed its way, stone by stone, into such\ncompany as St. Peter's at Rome, and the marvel at Milan. Fanny found her\nway down the crude cinder paths that made an alley-like approach to\nthe cathedral. She entered at the side door that one found by following\narrows posted on the rough wooden fence. Once inside she stood a moment,\nawed by the immensity of the half-finished nave. As she stood there,\nhands clasped, her face turned raptly up to where the massive granite\ncolumns reared their height to frame the choir, she was, for the moment,\nas devout as any Episcopalian whose money had helped make the great\nbuilding. Not only devout, but prayerful, ecstatic. That was partly due\nto the effect of the pillars, the lights, the tapestries, the great,\nunfinished chunks of stone that loomed out from the side walls, and the\npurple shadow cast by the window above the chapels at the far end; and\npartly to the actress in her that responded magically to any mood, and\nalways to surroundings. Later she walked softly down the deserted nave,\npast the choir, to the cluster of chapels, set like gems at one end,\nand running from north to south, in a semi-circle. A placard outside one\nsaid, “St. Saviour's chapel. For those who wish to rest and pray.” All\nwhite marble, this little nook, gleaming softly in the gray half-light.\nFanny entered, and sat down. She was quite alone. The roar and crash\nof the Eighth avenue L, the Amsterdam cars, the motors drumming up\nMorningside hill, were softened here to a soothing hum.\n\nFor those who wish to rest and pray.\n\nFanny Brandeis had neither rested nor prayed since that hideous day when\nshe had hurled her prayer of defiance at Him. But something within her\nnow began a groping for words; for words that should follow an ancient\nplea beginning, “O God of my Fathers----” But at that the picture of the\nroom came back to her mental vision--the room so quiet except for the\nbreathing of the woman on the bed; the woman with the tolerant, humorous\nmouth, and the straight, clever nose, and the softly bright brown eyes,\nall so strangely pinched and shrunken-looking now----\n\nFanny got to her feet, with a noisy scraping of the chair on the stone\nfloor. The vague, half-formed prayer died at birth. She found her way\nout of the dim, quiet little chapel, up the long aisle and out the great\ndoor. She shivered a little in the cold of the early January morning as\nshe hurried toward the Broadway subway.\n\nAt nine-thirty she was standing at a counter in the infants' wear\nsection at Best's, making mental notes while the unsuspecting saleswoman\nshowed her how the pink ribbon in this year's models was brought\nunder the beading, French fashion, instead of weaving through it,\nas heretofore. At ten-thirty she was saying to Sid Udell, “I think\na written contract is always best. Then we'll all know just where we\nstand. Mr. Fenger will be on next week to arrange the details, but just\nnow a very brief written understanding to show him on my return would\ndo.”\n\nAnd she got it, and tucked it away in her bag, in triumph.\n\nShe tried to leave New York without talking to Heyl, but some quiet,\ninsistent force impelled her to act contrary to her resolution. It was,\nafter all, the urge of the stronger wish against the weaker.\n\nWhen he heard her voice over the telephone Heyl did not say, “Who is\nthis?” Neither did he put those inevitable questions of the dweller to\nthe transient, “Where are you? How long have you been here?” What he\nsaid was, “How're you going to avoid dining with me to-night?”\n\nTo which Fanny replied, promptly, “By taking the Twentieth Century back\nto Chicago to-day.”\n\nA little silence. A hurt silence. Then, “When they get the Twentieth\nCentury habit they're as good as lost. How's the infants' wear business,\nFanny?”\n\n“Booming, thank you. I want to tell you I've read the column every day.\nIt's wonderful stuff.”\n\n“It's a wonderful job. I'm a lucky boy. I'm doing the thing I'd rather\ndo than anything else in the world. There are mighty few who can say\nthat.” There was another silence, awkward, heavy. Then, “Fanny, you're\nnot really leaving to-day?”\n\n“I'll be in Chicago to-morrow, barring wrecks.”\n\n“You might have let me show you our more or less fair city.”\n\n“I've shown it to myself. I've seen Riverside Drive at sunset, and at\nnight. That alone would have been enough. But I've seen Fulton market,\ntoo, and the Grand street stalls, and Washington Square, and Central\nPark, and Lady Duff-Gordon's inner showroom, and the Night Court, and\nthe Grand Central subway horror at six p. m., and the gambling on\nthe Curb, and the bench sleepers in Madison Square--Oh, Clancy, the\nmisery----”\n\n“Heh, wait a minute! All this, alone?”\n\n“Yes. And one more thing. I've landed Horn & Udell, which means nothing\nto you, but to me it means that by Spring my department will be a credit\nto its stepmother; a real success.”\n\n“I knew it would be a success. So did you. Anything you might attempt\nwould be successful. You'd have made a successful lawyer, or cook, or\nactress, or hydraulic engineer, because you couldn't do a thing badly.\nIt isn't in you. You're a superlative sort of person. But that's no\nreason for being any of those things. If you won't admit a debt to\nhumanity, surely you'll acknowledge you've an obligation to yourself.”\n\n“Preaching again. Good-by.”\n\n“Fanny, you're afraid to see me.”\n\n“Don't be ridiculous. Why should I be?”\n\n“Because I say aloud the things you daren't let yourself think. If I\nwere to promise not to talk about anything but flannel bands----”\n\n“Will you promise?”\n\n“No. But I'm going to meet you at the clock at the Grand Central Station\nfifteen minutes before train time. I don't care if every infants' wear\nmanufacturer in New York had a prior claim on your time. You may as well\nbe there, because if you're not I'll get on the train and stay on as far\nas Albany. Take your choice.”\n\nHe was there before her. Fanny, following the wake of a redcap, picked\nhim at once from among the crowd of clock-waiters. He saw her at the\nsame time, and started forward with that singularly lithe, springy step\nwhich was, after all, just the result of perfectly trained muscles in\ncoordination. He was wearing New York clothes--the right kind, Fanny\nnoted.\n\nTheir hands met. “How well you look,” said Fanny, rather lamely.\n\n“It's the clothes,” said Heyl, and began to revolve slowly, coyly,\nhands out, palms down, eyelids drooping, in delicious imitation of those\nladies whose business it is to revolve thus for fashion.\n\n“Clancy, you idiot! All these people! Stop it!”\n\n“But get the grace! Get the easy English hang, at once so loose and so\nclinging.”\n\nFanny grinned, appreciatively, and led the way through the gate to the\ntrain. She was surprisingly glad to be with him again. On discovering\nthat, she began to talk rapidly, and about him.\n\n“Tell me, how do you manage to keep that fresh viewpoint? Everybody else\nwho comes to New York to write loses his identity. The city swallows him\nup. I mean by that, that things seem to strike you as freshly as they\ndid when you first came. I remember you wrote me an amazing letter.”\n\n“For one thing, I'll never be anything but a foreigner in New York.\nI'll never quite believe Broadway. I'll never cease to marvel at Fifth\navenue, and Cooper Union, and the Bronx. The time may come when I can\ntake the subway for granted, but don't ask it of me just yet.”\n\n“But the other writers--and all those people who live down in Washington\nSquare?”\n\n“I never see them. It's sure death. Those Greenwichers are always taking\nout their own feelings and analyzing them, and pawing them over,\nand passing them around. When they get through with them they're so\nthumb-marked and greasy that no one else wants them. They don't get\nenough golf, those Greenwichers. They don't get enough tennis. They\ndon't get enough walking in the open places. Gosh, no! I know better\nthan to fall for that kind of thing. They spend hours talking to each\nother, in dim-lighted attics, about Souls, and Society, and the Joy\nof Life, and the Greater Good. And they know all about each other's\ninsides. They talk themselves out, and there's nothing left to write\nabout. A little of that kind of thing purges and cleanses. Too much of\nit poisons, and clogs. No, ma'am! When I want to talk I go down and chin\nwith the foreman of our composing room. There's a chap that has what\nI call conversation. A philosopher, and knows everything in the world.\nComposing room foremen always are and do. Now, that's all of that. How\nabout Fanny Brandeis? Any sketches? Come on. Confess. Grand street,\nanyway.”\n\n“I haven't touched a pencil, except to add up a column of figures or\ncopy an order, since last September, when you were so sure I couldn't\nstop.”\n\n“You've done a thousand in your head. And if you haven't done one on\npaper so much the better. You'll jam them back, and stifle them, and\nscrew the cover down tight on every natural impulse, and then, some day,\nthe cover will blow off with a loud report. You can't kill that kind\nof thing, Fanny. It would have to be a wholesale massacre of all the\ncenturies behind you. I don't so much mind your being disloyal to your\ntribe, or race, or whatever you want to call it. But you've turned your\nback on yourself; you've got an obligation to humanity, and I'll nag\nyou till you pay it. I don't care if I lose you, so long as you find\nyourself. The thing you've got isn't merely racial. God, no! It's\nuniversal. And you owe it to the world. Pay up, Fanny! Pay up!”\n\n“Look here!” began Fanny, her voice low with anger; “the last time I saw\nyou I said I'd never again put myself in a position to be lectured by\nyou, like a schoolgirl. I mean it, this time. If you have anything\nelse to say to me, say it now. The train leaves”--she glanced at\nher wrist--“in two minutes, thank Heaven, and this will be your last\nchance.”\n\n“All right,” said Heyl. “I have got something to say. Do you wear\nhatpins?”\n\n“Hatpins!” blankly. “Not with this small hat, but what----”\n\n“That means you're defenseless. If you're going to prowl the streets of\nChicago alone get this: If you double your fist this way, and tuck your\nthumb alongside, like that, and aim for this spot right here, about two\ninches this side of the chin, bringing your arm back, and up, quickly,\nlike a piston, the person you hit will go down, limp. There's a nerve\nright here that communicates with the brain. That blow makes you\nsee stars, bright lights, and fancy colors. They use it in the comic\npapers.”\n\n“You ARE crazy,” said Fanny, as though at last assured of a\nlong-suspected truth. The train began to move, almost imperceptibly.\n“Run!” she cried.\n\nHeyl sped up the aisle. At the door he turned. “It's called an\nuppercut,” he shouted to the amazement of the other passengers. And\nleaped from the train.\n\nFanny sank into her seat, weakly. Then she began to laugh, and there was\na dash of hysteria in it. He had left a paper on the car seat. It was\nthe Star. Fanny crumpled it, childishly, and kicked it under the seat.\nShe took off her hat, arranged her belongings, and sat back with eyes\nclosed. After a few moments she opened them, fished about under the seat\nfor the crumpled copy of the Star, and read it, turning at once to his\ncolumn. She thought it was a very unpretentious thing, that column, and\nyet so full of insight, and sagacity, and whimsical humor. Not a guffaw\nin it, but a smile in every fifth line. She wondered if those years\nof illness, and loneliness, with weeks of reading, and tramping, and\nclimbing in the Colorado mountains had kept him strangely young, or made\nhim strangely old.\n\nShe welcomed the hours that lay between New York and Chicago. They would\ngive her an opportunity to digest the events of the past ten days.\nIn her systematic mind she began to range them in the order of their\nimportance. Horn & Udell came first, of course, and then the line of\nmaternity dresses she had selected to take the place of the hideous\nmodels carried under Slosson's regime. And then the slip-over pinafores.\nBut somehow her thoughts became jumbled here, so that faces instead of\ngarments filled her mind's eye. Again and again there swam into her ken\nthe face of that woman of fifty, in decent widow's weeds, who had stood\nthere in the Night Court, charged with drunkenness on the streets. And\nthe man with the frost-bitten fingers in Madison Square. And the dog in\nthe sweater. And the feverish concentration of the piece-work sewers in\nthe window of the loft building.\n\nShe gave it up, selected a magazine, and decided to go in to lunch.\n\nThere was nothing spectacular about the welcome she got on her return\nto the office after this first trip. A firm that counts its employees by\nthe thousands, and its profits in tens of millions, cannot be expected\nto draw up formal resolutions of thanks when a heretofore flabby\ndepartment begins to show signs of red blood.\n\nElla Monahan said, “They'll make light of it--all but Fenger. That's\ntheir way.”\n\nSlosson drummed with his fingers all the time she was giving him the\nresult of her work in terms of style, material, quantity, time, and\nprice. When she had finished he said, “Well, all I can say is we seem\nto be going out of the mail order business and into the imported novelty\nline, de luxe. I suppose by next Christmas the grocery department will\nbe putting in artichoke hearts, and truffles and French champagne by the\nkeg for community orders.”\n\nTo which Fanny had returned, sweetly, “If Oregon and Wyoming show any\ndesire for artichokes and champagne I don't see why we shouldn't.”\n\nFenger, strangely enough, said little. He was apt to be rather curt\nthese days, and almost irritable. Fanny attributed it to the reaction\nfollowing the strain of the Christmas rush.\n\nOne did not approach Fenger's office except by appointment. Fanny sent\nword to him of her return. For two days she heard nothing from him. Then\nthe voice of the snuff-brown secretary summoned her. She did not have\nto wait this time, but passed directly through the big bright outer room\ninto the smaller room. The Power House, Fanny called it.\n\nFenger was facing the door. “Missed you,” he said.\n\n“You must have,” Fanny laughed, “with only nine thousand nine hundred\nand ninety-nine to look after.”\n\n“You look as if you'd been on a vacation, instead of a test trip.”\n\n“So I have. Why didn't you warn me that business, as transacted in New\nYork, is a series of social rites? I didn't have enough white kid gloves\nto go round. No one will talk business in an office. I don't see what\nthey use offices for, except as places in which to receive their mail.\nYou utter the word `Business,' and the other person immediately says,\n`Lunch.' No wholesaler seems able to quote you his prices until he\nhas been sustained by half a dozen Cape Cods. I don't want to see a\nrestaurant or a rose silk shade for weeks.”\n\nFenger tapped the little pile of papers on his desk. “I've read your\nreports. If you can do that on lunches, I'd like to see what you could\nput over in a series of dinners.”\n\n“Heaven forbid,” said Fanny, fervently. Then, for a very concentrated\nfifteen minutes they went over the reports together. Fanny's voice grew\ndry and lifeless as she went into figures.\n\n“You don't sound particularly enthusiastic,” Fenger said, when they had\nfinished, “considering that you've accomplished what you set out to do.”\n\n“That's just it,” quickly. “I like the uncertainty. It was interesting\nto deal directly with those people, to stack one's arguments, and\npersonality, and mentality and power over theirs, until they had to give\nway. But after that! Well, you can't expect me to be vitally interested\nin gross lots, and carloads and dating.”\n\n“It's part of business.”\n\n“It's the part I hate.”\n\nFenger stacked the papers neatly. “You came in June, didn't you?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“It has been a remarkable eight-months' record, even at Haynes-Cooper's,\nwhere records are the rule. Have you been through the plant since the\ntime you first went through?”\n\n“Through it! Goodness, no! It would take a day.”\n\n“Then I wish you'd take it. I like to have the heads of departments\ngo through the plant at least twice a year. You'll find the fourteenth\nfloor has been cleared and is being used entirely by the selectors. The\nmanufacturers' samples are spread on the tables in the various sections.\nYou'll find your place ready for you. You'll be amused at Daly's\nsection. He took your suggestion about trying the blouses on live models\ninstead of selecting them as he used to. You remember you said that one\ncould tell about the lines and style of a dress merely by looking at it,\nbut that a blouse is just a limp rag until it's on.”\n\n“It's true of the flimsy Georgette things women want now. They may be\nlovely in the box and hideously unbecoming when worn. If Daly's going in\nfor the higher grade stuff he can't risk choosing unbecoming models.”\n\n“Wait till you see him!” smiled Fenger, “sitting there like a sultan\nwhile the pinks and blues, and whites and plaids parade before him.” He\nturned to his desk again. “That's all, Miss Brandeis. Thank you.” Then,\nat a sudden thought. “Do you know that all your suggestions have been\nhuman suggestions? I mean they all have had to do with people. Tell me,\nhow do you happen to have learned so much about what people feel and\nthink, in such a short time?”\n\nThe thing that Clarence Heyl had said flashed through her mind, and she\nwas startled to find herself quoting it. “It hasn't been a short time,”\n she said.\n\n“It took a thousand years.” And left Fenger staring, puzzled.\n\nShe took next morning for her tour of the plant as Fenger had suggested.\nShe went through it, not as the startled, wide-eyed girl of eight months\nbefore had gone, but critically, and with a little unconscious air of\nauthority. For, this organization, vast though it was, actually showed\nher imprint. She could have put her finger on this spot, and that,\nsaying, “Here is the mark of my personality.” And she thought, as she\npassed from department to department, “Ten thousand a year, if you keep\non as you've started.” Up one aisle and down the next. Bundles, bundles,\nbundles. And everywhere you saw the yellow order-slips. In the hands of\nthe stock boys whizzing by on roller skates; in the filing department;\nin the traffic department. The very air seemed jaundiced with those\nclouds of yellow order-slips. She stopped a moment, fascinated as always\nbefore the main spiral gravity chute down which the bundles--hundreds\nof them, thousands of them daily--chased each other to--to what? Fanny\nasked herself. She knew, vaguely, that hands caught these bundles\nhalfway, and redirected them toward the proper channel, where they were\nassembled and made ready for shipping or mailing. She turned to a stock\nboy.\n\n“Where does this empty?” she asked.\n\n“Floor below,” said the boy, “on the platform.”\n\nFanny walked down a flight of iron stairs, and around to face the spiral\nchute again. In front of the chute, and connected with it by a great\nmetal lip, was a platform perhaps twelve feet above the floor and\nlooking very much like the pilot's deck of a ship. A little flight of\nsteps led up to it--very steep steps, that trembled a little under a\nrepetition of shocks that came from above. Fanny climbed them warily,\ngained the top, and found herself standing next to the girl whose face\nhad gleamed out at her from among those thousands in the crowd pouring\nout of the plant. The girl glanced up at Fanny for a second--no, for the\nfraction of a second. Her job was the kind that permitted no more than\nthat. Fanny watched her for one breathless moment. In that moment she\nunderstood the look that had been stamped on the girl's face that night;\nthe look that had cried: “Release!” For this platform, shaking under the\nthud of bundles, bundles, bundles, was the stomach of the Haynes-Cooper\nplant. Sixty per cent of the forty-five thousand daily orders passed\nthrough the hands of this girl and her assistants. Down the chutes\nswished the bundles, stamped with their section mark, and here they were\ncaught deftly and hurled into one of the dozen conveyers that flowed\nout from this main stream. The wrong bundle into the wrong conveyer?\nConfusion in the shipping room. It only took a glance of the eye and a\nmotion of the arms. But that glance and that motion had been boiled down\nto the very concentrated essence of economy. They seemed to be working\nwith fury, but then, so does a pile-driver until you get the simplicity\nof it.\n\nFanny bent over the girl (it was a noisy corner) and put a question. The\ngirl did not pause in her work as she answered it. She caught a bundle\nwith one hand, hurled one into a conveyer with the other.\n\n“Seven a week,” she said. And deftly caught the next slithering bundle.\n\nFanny watched her for another moment. Then she turned and went down the\nsteep stairs.\n\n“None of your business,” she said to herself, and continued her tour.\n“None of your business.” She went up to the new selectors' floor, and\nfound the plan running as smoothly as if it had been part of the plant's\nsystem for years. The elevator whisked her up to the top floor, where\nshe met the plant's latest practical fad, the new textile chemist--a\ncharming youth, disguised in bone-rimmed glasses, who did the honors of\nhis little laboratory with all the manner of a Harvard host. This was\nthe fusing oven for silks. Here was the drying oven. This delicate scale\nweighed every ounce of the cloth swatches that came in for inspection,\nto get the percentage of wool and cotton. Not a chance for the\nmanufacturer to slip shoddy into his goods, now.\n\n“Mm,” said Fanny, politely. She hated complicated processes that had to\ndo with scales, and weights, and pounds, and acids. She crossed over\nto the Administration Building, and stopped at the door marked, “Mrs.\nKnowles.” If you had been an employee of the Haynes-Cooper company, and\nhad been asked to define Mrs. Knowles's position the chances are that\nyou would have found yourself floundering, wordless. Haynes-Cooper\nwas reluctant to acknowledge the need of Mrs. Knowles. Still, when you\nemploy ten thousand people, and more than half of these are girls, and\nfifty per cent of these girls are unskilled, ignorant, and terribly\nhuman you find that a Mrs. Knowles saves the equivalent of ten times her\nsalary in wear and tear and general prevention. She could have told you\ntragic stories, could Mrs. Knowles, and sordid stories, and comic too;\nshe knew how to deal with terror, and shame, and stubborn silence, and\nhopeless misery. Gray-haired and motherly? Not at all. An astonishingly\nyoung, pleasingly plumpish woman, with nothing remarkable about her\nexcept a certain splendid calm. Four years out of Vassar, and already\nshe had learned that if you fold your hands in your lap and wait,\nquietly, asking no questions, almost any one will tell you almost\nanything.\n\n“Hello!” called Fanny. “How are our morals this morning?”\n\n“Going up!” answered Esther Knowles, “considering that it's Tuesday.\nCome in. How's the infant prodigy, I lunched with Ella Monahan, and she\ntold me your first New York trip was a whirlwind. Congratulations!”\n\n“Thanks. I can't stop. I haven't touched my desk to-day. I just want\nto ask you if you know the name of that girl who has charge of the main\nchute in the merchandise building.”\n\n“Good Lord, child! There are thousands of girls.”\n\n“But this one's rather special. She is awfully pretty, and rather\ndifferent looking. Exquisite coloring, a discontented expression, and a\nblouse that's too low in the neck.”\n\n“Which might be a description of Fanny Brandeis herself, barring the\nblouse,” laughed Mrs. Knowles. Then, at the startled look in Fanny's\nface, “Do forgive me. And don't look so horrified. I think I know which\none you mean. Her name is Sarah Sapinsky--yes, isn't it a pity!--and\nit's queer that you should ask me about her because I've been having\ntrouble with that particular girl.”\n\n“Trouble?”\n\n“She knows she's pretty, and she knows she's different, and she knows\nshe's handicapped, and that accounts for the discontented expression.\nThat, and some other things. She gets seven a week here, and they take\njust about all of it at home. She says she's sick of it. She has left\nhome twice. I don't blame the child, but I've always managed to bring\nher back. Some day there'll be a third time--and I'm afraid of it. She's\nnot bad. She's really rather splendid, and she has a certain dreadful\nphilosophy of her own. Her theory is that there are only two kinds of\npeople in the world. Those that give, and those that take. And she's\ntired of giving. Sarah didn't put it just that way; but you know what\nshe means, don't you?”\n\n“I know what she means,” said Fanny, grimly.\n\nSo it was Sarah she saw above all else in her trip through the gigantic\nplant; Sarah's face shone out from among the thousands; the thud-thud\nof Sarah's bundle-chute beat a dull accompaniment to the hum of the big\nhive; above the rustle of those myriad yellow order-slips, through\nthe buzz of the busy mail room; beneath the roar of the presses in the\nprinting building, the crash of the dishes in the cafeteria, ran the\nleid-motif of Sarah-at-seven-a-week. Back in her office once more Fanny\ndictated a brief observation-report for Fenger's perusal.\n\n“It seems to me there's room for improvement in our card index file\nsystem. It's thorough, but unwieldy. It isn't a system any more. It's\na ceremony. Can't you get a corps of system sharks to simplify things\nthere?”\n\nShe went into detail and passed on to the next suggestion.\n\n“If the North American Cloak & Suit Company can sell mail order dresses\nthat are actually smart and in good taste, I don't see why we have to\ngo on carrying only the most hideous crudities in our women's dress\ndepartment. I know that the majority of our women customers wouldn't\nwear a plain, good looking little blue serge dress with a white\ncollar, and some tailored buttons. They want cerise satin revers on a\nplum-colored foulard, and that's what we've been giving them. But there\nare plenty of other women living miles from anywhere who know what's\nbeing worn on Fifth avenue. I don't know how they know it, but they\ndo. And they want it. Why can't we reach those women, as well as their\nshoddier sisters? The North American people do it. I'd wear one of\ntheir dresses myself. I wouldn't be found dead in one of ours. Here's a\nsuggestion:\n\n“Why can't we get Camille to design half a dozen models a season for\nus? Now don't roar at that. And don't think that the women on western\nranches haven't heard of Camille. They have. They may know nothing of\nMrs. Pankhurst, and Lillian Russell may be a myth to them, but I'll\nswear that every one of them knows that Camille is a dressmaker who\nmakes super-dresses. She is as much a household word among them as\nRoosevelt used to be to their men folks. And if we can promise them a\nCamille-designed dress for $7.85 (which we could) then why don't we?”\n\nAt the very end, to her stenographer's mystification, she added this\nirrelevant line.\n\n“Seven dollars a week is not a living wage.”\n\nThe report went to Fenger. He hurdled lightly over the first suggestion,\nknowing that the file system was as simple as a monster of its bulk\ncould be. He ignored the third hint. The second suggestion amused,\nthen interested, then convinced him. Within six months Camille's name\nactually appeared in the Haynes-Cooper catalogue. Not that alone, the\nHaynes-Cooper company broke its rule as to outside advertising, and\nannounced in full-page magazine ads the news of the $7.85 gowns designed\nby Camille especially for the Haynes-Cooper company. There went up\na nationwide shout of amusement and unbelief, but the announcement\ncontinued. Camille (herself a frump with a fringe) whose frocks were\nworn by queens, and dancers and matrons with millions, and debutantes;\nCamille, who had introduced the slouch, revived the hoop, discovered the\nsunset chiffon, had actually consented to design six models every\nseason for the mail order millions of the Haynes-Cooper women's dress\ndepartment--at a price that made even Michael Fenger wince.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\n\nFanny Brandeis' blouses showed real Cluny now, and her hats were nothing\nbut line. A scant two years before she had wondered if she would ever\nreach a pinnacle of success lofty enough to enable her to wear blue\ntailor suits as smart as the well-cut garments worn by her mother's\nfriend, Mrs. Emma McChesney. Mrs. McChesney's trig little suits had cost\nfifty dollars, and had looked sixty. Fanny's now cost one hundred and\ntwenty-five, and looked one hundred and twenty-five. Her sleeves alone\ngave it away. If you would test the soul of a tailor you have only to\nglance at shoulder-seam, elbow and wrist. Therein lies the wizardry.\nFanny's sleeve flowed from arm-pit to thumb-bone without a ripple.\nAlso she moved from the South side to the North side, always a sign of\nprosperity or social ambition, in Chicago. Her new apartment was near\nthe lake, exhilaratingly high, correspondingly expensive. And she was\nhideously lonely. She was earning a man-size salary now, and she was\nworking like a man. A less magnificently healthy woman could not have\nstood the strain, for Fanny Brandeis was working with her head, not her\nheart. When we say heart we have come to mean something more than the\nhollow muscular structure that propels the blood through the veins.\nThat, in the dictionary, is the primary definition. The secondary\ndefinition has to do with such words as emotion, sympathy, tenderness,\ncourage, conviction. She was working, now, as Michael Fenger worked,\nrelentlessly, coldly, indomitably, using all the material at hand as\na means to an end, with never a thought of the material itself, as a\nbuilder reaches for a brick, or stone, and fits it into place, smoothly,\nalmost without actually seeing the brick itself, except as something\nwhich will help to make a finished wall. She rarely prowled the city\nnow. She told herself she was too tired at night, and on Sundays and\nholidays, and I suppose she was. Indeed, she no longer saw things with\nher former vision. It was as though her soul had shriveled in direct\nproportion to her salary's expansion. The streets seldom furnished her\nwith a rich mental meal now. When she met a woman with a child, in\nthe park, her keen eye noted the child's dress before it saw the child\nitself, if, indeed, she noticed the child at all.\n\nFascinating Facts, the guileless, pink-cheeked youth who had driven\nher home the night of her first visit to the Fengers, shortly after her\ncoming to Haynes-Cooper's, had proved her faithful slave, and she had\nnot abused his devotion. Indeed, she hardly considered it that. The sex\nside of her was being repressed with the artist side. Most men found her\ncurt, brisk, businesslike manner a little repellent, though interesting.\nThey never made love to her, in spite of her undeniable attractiveness.\nFascinating Facts drove her about in his smart little roadster and one\nnight he established himself in her memory forever as the first man who\nhad ever asked her to marry him. He did it haltingly, painfully, almost\ngrudgingly. Fanny was frankly amazed. She had enjoyed going about with\nhim. He rested and soothed her. He, in turn, had been stimulated by her\nenergy, her humor, her electric force. Nothing was said for a minute\nafter his awkward declaration.\n\n“But,” he persisted, “you like me, don't you?”\n\n“Of course I do. Immensely.”\n\n“Then why?”\n\n“When a woman of my sort marries it's a miracle. I'm twenty-six, and\nintelligent and very successful. A frightful combination. Unmarried\nwomen of my type aren't content just to feel. They must analyze their\nfeelings. And analysis is death to romance.”\n\n“Great Scott! You expect to marry somebody sometime, don't you, Fanny?”\n\n“No one I know now. When I do marry, if I do, it will be with the idea\nof making a definite gain. I don't mean necessarily worldly gain,\nthough that would be a factor, too.” Fascinating Facts had been staring\nstraight ahead, his hands gripping the wheel with unnecessary rigidity.\nHe relaxed a little now, and even laughed, though not very successfully.\nThen he said something very wise, for him.\n\n“Listen to me, girl. You'll never get away with that vampire stuff.\nTalons are things you have to be born with. You'll never learn to grab\nwith these.” He reached over, and picked up her left hand lying inertly\nin her lap, and brought it up to his lips, and kissed it, glove and all.\n“They're built on the open-face pattern--for giving. You can't fool me.\nI know.”\n\nA year and a half after her coming to Haynes-Cooper Fanny's department\nwas doing a business of a million a year. The need had been there. She\nhad merely given it the impetus. She was working more or less directly\nwith Fenger now, with an eye on every one of the departments that had\nto do with women's clothing, from shoes to hats. Not that she did any\nactual buying, or selling in these departments. She still confined\nher actual selecting of goods to the infants' wear section, but she\noccupied, unofficially, the position of assistant to the General\nMerchandise Manager. They worked well together, she and Fenger, their\nminds often marching along without the necessity of a single spoken\nword. There was no doubt that Fenger's mind was a marvelous piece\nof mechanism. Under it the Haynes-Cooper plant functioned with the\nclockwork regularity of a gigantic automaton. System and Results--these\nwere his twin gods. With his mind intent on them he failed to see that\nnew gods, born of spiritual unrest, were being set up in the temples of\nBig Business. Their coming had been rumored for many years. Words such\nas Brotherhood, Labor, Rights, Humanity, Hours, once regarded as the\nspecial property of the street corner ranter, were creeping into our\neveryday vocabulary. And strangely enough, Nathan Haynes, the gentle,\nthe bewildered, the uninspired, heard them, and listened. Nathan Haynes\nhad begun to accustom himself to the roar of the flood that had formerly\ndeafened him. He was no longer stunned by the inrush of his millions.\nThe report sheet handed him daily had never ceased to be a wildly\nunexpected thing, and he still shrank from it, sometimes. It was so\nfantastic, so out of all reason. But he even dared, now and then, to put\nout a tentative hand to guide the flood. He began to realize, vaguely,\nthat Italian Gardens, and marble pools, educational endowments and pet\ncharities were but poor, ineffectual barriers of mud and sticks, soon\nswept away by the torrent. As he sat there in his great, luxurious\noffice, with the dim, rich old portraits gleaming down on him from the\nwalls, he began, gropingly, to evolve a new plan; a plan by which the\ngolden flood was to be curbed, divided, and made to form a sub-stream,\nto be utilized for the good of the many; for the good of the Ten\nThousand, who were almost Fifteen Thousand now, with another fifteen\nthousand in mills and factories at distant points, whose entire\noutput was swallowed up by the Haynes-Cooper plant. Michael Fenger,\nSuper-Manager, listened to the plan, smiled tolerantly, and went on\nperfecting an already miraculous System. Sarah Sapinsky, at seven a\nweek, was just so much untrained labor material, easily replaced by\nmaterial exactly like it. No, Michael Fenger, with his head in the sand,\nheard no talk of new gods. He only knew that the monster plant under\nhis management was yielding the greatest possible profit under the least\npossible outlay.\n\nIn Fanny Brandeis he had found a stimulating, energizing fellow worker.\nThat had been from the beginning. In the first month or two of her\nwork, when her keen brain was darting here and there, into forgotten\nand neglected corners, ferreting out dusty scraps of business waste and\nholding them up to the light, disdainfully, Fenger had watched her\nwith a mingling of amusement and a sort of fond pride, as one would a\nprecocious child. As the months went on the pride and amusement welded\ninto something more than admiration, such as one expert feels for a\nfellow-craftsman. Long before the end of the first year he knew that\nhere was a woman such as he had dreamed of all his life and never hoped\nto find. He often found himself sitting at his office desk, or in his\nlibrary at home, staring straight ahead for a longer time than he dared\nadmit, his papers or book forgotten in his hand. His thoughts applied\nto her adjectives which proved her a paradox: Generous, sympathetic,\nwarm-hearted, impulsive, imaginative; cold, indomitable, brilliant,\ndaring, intuitive. He would rouse himself almost angrily and force\nhimself to concentrate again upon the page before him. I don't know how\nhe thought it all would end--he whose life-habit it was to follow out\nevery process to its ultimate step, whether mental or mechanical. As for\nFanny, there was nothing of the intriguant about her. She was used to\nadmiration. She was accustomed to deference from men. Brandeis' Bazaar\nhad insured that. All her life men had taken orders from her, all the\nway from Aloysius and the blithe traveling men of whom she bought goods,\nto the salesmen and importers in the Chicago wholesale houses. If they\nhad attempted, occasionally, to mingle the social and personal with the\ncommercial Fanny had not resented their attitude. She had accepted their\nadmiration and refused their invitations with equal good nature, and\nthus retained their friendship. It is not exaggeration to say that\nshe looked upon Michael Fenger much as she had upon these genial\nfellow-workers. A woman as straightforward and direct as she has what is\nknown as a single-track mind in such matters. It is your soft and silken\nmollusc type of woman whose mind pursues a slimy and labyrinthine trail.\nBut it is useless to say that she did not feel something of the intense\npersonal attraction of the man. Often it used to puzzle and annoy her\nto find that as they sat arguing in the brisk, everyday atmosphere of\noffice or merchandise room the air between them would suddenly become\nelectric, vibrant. They met each other's eyes with effort. When their\nhands touched, accidentally, over papers or samples they snatched them\nback. Fanny found herself laughing uncertainly, at nothing, and was\nfurious. When a silence fell between them they would pounce upon it,\nbreathlessly, and smother it with talk.\n\nDo not think that any furtive love-making went on, sandwiched between\nshop talk. Their conversation might have taken place between two men.\nIndeed, they often were brutally frank to each other. Fanny had the\nvision, Fenger the science to apply it. Sometimes her intuition leaped\nahead of his reasoning. Then he would say, “I'm not sold on that,” which\nis modern business slang meaning, “You haven't convinced me.” She would\ngo back and start afresh, covering the ground more slowly.\n\nUsually her suggestions were practical and what might be termed human.\nThey seemed to be founded on an uncanny knowledge of people's frailties.\nIt was only when she touched upon his beloved System that he was\nadamant.\n\n“None of that socialistic stuff,” he would say. “This isn't a Benevolent\nAssociation we're running. It's the biggest mail order business in\nthe world, and its back-bone is System. I've been just fifteen years\nperfecting that System. It's my job. Hands off.”\n\n“A fifteen year old system ought to be scrapped,” Fanny would retort,\nboldly. “Anyway, the Simon Legree thing has gone out.”\n\nNo one in the plant had ever dared to talk to him like that. He would\nglare down at Fanny for a moment, like a mastiff on a terrier. Fanny,\nseeing his face rage-red, would flash him a cheerful and impudent smile.\nThe anger, fading slowly, gave way to another look, so that admiration\nand resentment mingled for a moment.\n\n“Lucky for you you're not a man.”\n\n“I wish I were.”\n\n“I'm glad you're not.”\n\nNot a very thrilling conversation for those of you who are seeking\nheartthrobs.\n\nIn May Fanny made her first trip to Europe for the firm. It was a sudden\nplan. Instantly Theodore leaped to her mind and she was startled at the\ntumult she felt at the thought of seeing him and his child. The baby,\na girl, was more than a year old. Her business, a matter of two weeks,\nperhaps, was all in Berlin and Paris, but she cabled Theodore that she\nwould come to them in Munich, if only for a day or two. She had very\nlittle curiosity about the woman Theodore had married. The memory of\nthat first photograph of hers, befrizzed, bejeweled, and asmirk, had\nnever effaced itself. It had stamped her indelibly in Fanny's mind.\n\nThe day before she left for New York (she sailed from there) she had a\nletter from Theodore. It was evident at once that he had not received\nher cable. He was in Russia, giving a series of concerts. Olga and the\nbaby were with him. He would be back in Munich in June. There was some\ntalk of America. When Fanny realized that she was not to see him she\nexperienced a strange feeling that was a mixture of regret and relief.\nAll the family love in her, a racial trait, had been stirred at the\nthought of again seeing that dear blond brother, the self-centered,\nwillful, gifted boy who had held the little congregation rapt, there in\nthe Jewish house of worship in Winnebago. But she had recoiled a little\nfrom the meeting with this other unknown person who gave concerts in\nRussia, who had adopted Munich as his home, who was the husband of this\nOlga person, and the father of a ridiculously German looking baby in a\nvery German looking dress, all lace and tucks, and wearing bracelets on\nits chubby arms, and a locket round its neck. That was what one might\nexpect of Olga's baby. But not of Theodore's. Besides, what business had\nthat boy with a baby, anyway? Himself a baby.\n\nFenger had arranged for her cabin, and she rather resented its luxury\nuntil she learned later, that it is the buyers who always occupy the\nstaterooms de luxe on ocean liners. She learned, too, that the men in\nyachting caps and white flannels, and the women in the smartest and\nmost subdued of blue serge and furs were not millionaires temporarily\ndeprived of their own private seagoing craft, but buyers like herself,\nshrewd, aggressive, wise and incredibly endowed with savoir faire.\nMerely to watch one of them dealing with a deck steward was to know for\nall time the superiority of mind over matter.\n\nMost incongruously, it was Ella Monahan and Clarence Heyl who waved\ngood-by to her as her ship swung clear of the dock. Ella was in New\nYork on her monthly trip. Heyl had appeared at the hotel as Fanny was\nadjusting her veil and casting a last rather wild look around the room.\nMolly Brandeis had been the kind of woman who never misses a train or\noverlooks a hairpin. Fanny's early training had proved invaluable more\nthan once in the last two years. Nevertheless, she was rather flustered,\nfor her, as the elevator took her down to the main floor. She told\nherself it was not the contemplation of the voyage itself that thrilled\nher. It was the fact that here was another step definitely marking her\nprogress. Heyl, looking incredibly limp, was leaning against a gaudy\nmarble pillar, his eyes on the downcoming elevators. Fanny saw him\njust an instant before he saw her, and in that moment she found herself\nwondering why this boy (she felt years older than he) should look so\nfantastically out of place in this great, glittering, feverish hotel\nlobby. Just a shy, rather swarthy Jewish boy, who wore the right kind of\nclothes in the wrong manner--then Heyl saw her and came swiftly toward\nher.\n\n“Hello, Fan!”\n\n“Hello, Clancy!” They had not seen each other in six months.\n\n“Anybody else going down with you?”\n\n“No. Ella Monahan had a last-minute business appointment, but she\npromised to be at the dock, somehow, before the boat leaves. I'm going\nto be grand, and taxi all the way.”\n\n“I've an open car, waiting.”\n\n“But I won't have it! I can't let you do that.”\n\n“Oh, yes you can. Don't take it so hard. That's the trouble with you\nbusiness women. You're killing the gallantry of a nation. Some day one\nof you will get up and give me a seat in a subway----”\n\n“I'll punish you for that, Clancy. If you want the Jane Austen thing\nI'll accommodate. I'll drop my handkerchief, gloves, bag, flowers and\nfur scarf at intervals of five minutes all the way downtown. Then you\nmay scramble around on the floor of the cab and feel like a knight.”\n\nFanny had long ago ceased to try to define the charm of this man. She\nalways meant to be serenely dignified with him. She always ended by\nfeeling very young, and, somehow, gloriously carefree and lighthearted.\nThere was about him a naturalness, a simplicity, to which one responded\nin kind.\n\nSeated beside her he turned and regarded her with disconcerting\nscrutiny.\n\n“Like it?” demanded Fanny, pertly. And smoothed her veil, consciously.\n\n“No.”\n\n“Well, for a man who looks negligee even in evening clothes aren't you\novercritical?”\n\n“I'm not criticizing your clothes. Even I can see that that hat and suit\nhave the repressed note that means money. And you're the kind of woman\nwho looks her best in those plain dark things.”\n\n“Well, then?”\n\n“You look like a buyer. In two more years your face will have that hard\nfinish that never comes off.”\n\n“I am a buyer.”\n\n“You're not. You're a creator. Remember, I'm not belittling your\njob. It's a wonderful job--for Ella Monahan. I wish I had the gift of\neloquence. I wish I had the right to spank you. I wish I could prove to\nyou, somehow, that with your gift, and heritage, and racial right it's\nas criminal for you to be earning your thousands at Haynes-Cooper's as\nit would have been for a vestal virgin to desert her altar fire to stoke\na furnace. Your eyes are bright and hard, instead of tolerant. Your\nmouth is losing its graciousness. Your whole face is beginning to be\nstamped with a look that says shrewdness and experience, and success.”\n\n“I am successful. Why shouldn't I look it?”\n\n“Because you're a failure. I'm sick, I tell you--sick with\ndisappointment in you. Jane Addams would have been a success in\nbusiness, too. She was born with a humanity sense, and a value sense,\nand a something else that can't be acquired. Ida Tarbell could have\nmanaged your whole Haynes-Cooper plant, if she'd had to. So could a\ndozen other women I could name. You don't see any sign of what you call\nsuccess on Jane Addams's face, do you? You wouldn't say, on seeing her,\nthat here was a woman who looked as if she might afford hundred-dollar\ntailor suits and a town car. No. All you see in her face is the\nreflection of the souls of all the men and women she has worked to save.\nShe has covered her job--the job that the Lord intended her to cover.\nAnd to me she is the most radiantly beautiful woman I have ever seen.”\n\nFanny sat silent. She was twisting the fingers of one hand in the grip\nof the other, as she had since childhood, when deeply disturbed. And\nsuddenly she began to cry--silently, harrowingly, as a man cries, her\nshoulders shaking, her face buried in her furs.\n\n“Fanny! Fanny girl!” He was horribly disturbed and contrite. He patted\nher arm, awkwardly. She shook free of his hand, childishly. “Don't cry,\ndear. I'm sorry. It's just that I care so much. It's just----”\n\nShe raised an angry, tear-stained face. “It's just that you have an\nexalted idea of your own perceptions. It's just that you've grown up\nfrom what they used to call a bright little boy to a bright young man,\nand you're just as tiresome now as you were then. I'm happy enough,\nexcept when I see you. I'm getting the things I starved for all those\nyears. Why, I'll never get over being thrilled at the idea of being\nable to go to the theater, or to a concert, whenever I like. Actually\nwhenever I want to. And to be able to buy a jabot, or a smart hat, or a\nbook. You don't know how I wanted things, and how tired I got of never\nhaving them. I'm happy! I'm happy! Leave me alone!”\n\n“It's an awful price to pay for a hat, and a jabot, and a book and a\ntheater ticket, Fan.”\n\nElla Monahan had taken the tube, and was standing in the great shed,\nwatching arrivals with interest, long before they bumped over the\ncobblestones of Hoboken. The three descended to Fanny's cabin. Ella had\nsent champagne--six cosy pints in a wicker basket.\n\n“They say it's good for seasickness,” she announced, cheerfully, “but\nit's a lie. Nothing's good for seasickness, except death, or dry land.\nBut even if you do feel miserable--and you probably will--there's\nsomething about being able to lie in your berth and drink champagne\nalone, by the spoonful, that's sort of soothing.”\n\nHeyl had fallen silent. Fanny was radiant again, and exclamatory over\nher books and flowers.\n\n“Of course it's my first trip,” she explained, “and an event in my life,\nbut I didn't suppose that anybody else would care. What's this? Candy?\nGlace fruit.” She glanced around the luxurious little cabin, then up at\nHeyl, impudently. “I may be a coarse commercial person, Clancy, but I\nmust say I like this very, very much. Sorry.”\n\nThey went up on deck. Ella, a seasoned traveler, was full of parting\ninstructions. “And be sure to eat at Kempinski's, in Berlin. Twenty\ncents for lobster. And caviar! Big as hen's eggs, and as cheap as\ncodfish. And don't forget to order mai-bowle. It tastes like champagne,\nbut isn't, and it has the most delicious dwarf strawberries floating on\ntop. This is just the season for it. You're lucky. If you tip the waiter\none mark he's yours for life. Oh, and remember the plum compote. You'll\nbe disappointed in their Wertheim's that they're always bragging about.\nAfter all, Field's makes 'em all look like country stores.”\n\n“Wertheim's? Is that something to eat, too?”\n\n“No, idiot. It's their big department store.” Ella turned to Heyl,\nfor whom she felt mingled awe and liking. “If this trip of hers is\nsuccessful, the firm will probably send her over three or four times a\nyear. It's a wonderful chance for a kid like her.”\n\n“Then I hope,” said Heyl, quietly, “that this trip may be a failure.”\n\nElla smiled, uncertainly.\n\n“Don't laugh,” said Fanny, sharply. “He means it.”\n\nElla, sensing an unpleasant something in which she had no part, covered\nthe situation with another rush of conversation.\n\n“You'll get the jolt of your life when you come to Paris and find that\nyou're expected to pay for the lunches, and all the cab fares, and\neverything, of those shrimpy little commissionaires. Polite little\nfellows, they are, in frock coats, and mustaches, and they just stand\naside, as courtly as you please, while you pay for everything. Their\nhouse expects it. I almost passed away, the first time, but you get used\nto it. Say, imagine one of our traveling men letting you pay for his\nlunch and taxi.”\n\nShe rattled on, genially. Heyl listened with unfeigned delight. Ella\nfound herself suddenly abashed before those clear, far-seeing eyes. “You\nthink I'm a gabby old girl, don't you?”\n\n“I think you're a wonderful woman,” said Heyl. “Very wise, and very\nkind.”\n\n“Why--thanks,” faltered Ella. “Why--thanks.”\n\nThey said their good-bys. Ella hugged Fanny warm-heartedly. Then she\nturned away, awkwardly. Heyl put his two hands on Fanny's shoulders and\nlooked down at her. For a breathless second she thought he was about to\nkiss her. She was amazed to find herself hoping that he would. But he\ndidn't. “Good-by,” he said, simply. And took her hand in his steel grip\na moment, and dropped it. And turned away. A messenger boy, very much\nout of breath, came running up to her, a telegram in his hand.\n\n“For me?” Fanny opened it, frowned, smiled. “It's from Mr. Fenger. Good\nwishes. As if all those flowers weren't enough.”\n\n“Mm,” said Ella. She and Heyl descended the gang-way, and stood at the\ndock's edge, looking rather foolish and uncertain, as people do at such\ntimes. There followed a few moments of scramble, of absurdly shouted\nlast messages, of bells, and frantic waving of handkerchiefs. Fanny,\nat the rail, found her two among the crowd, and smiled down upon them,\nmistily. Ella was waving energetically. Heyl was standing quite still,\nlooking up. The ship swung clear, crept away from the dock. The good-bys\nswelled to a roar. Fanny leaned far over the rail and waved too, a sob\nin her throat. Then she saw that she was waving with the hand that held\nthe yellow telegram. She crumpled it in the other hand, and substituted\nher handkerchief. Heyl still stood, hat in hand, motionless.\n\n“Why don't you wave good-by?” she called, though he could not possibly\nhear. “Wave good-by!” And then the hand with the handkerchief went to\nher face, and she was weeping. I think it was that old drama-thrill in\nher, dormant for so long. But at that Heyl swung his hat above his head,\nthree times, like a schoolboy, and, grasping Ella's plump and resisting\narm, marched abruptly away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\n\nThe first week in June found her back in New York. That month of\nabsence had worked a subtle change. The two weeks spent in crossing and\nrecrossing had provided her with a let-down that had been almost jarring\nin its completeness. Everything competitive had seemed to fade away with\nthe receding shore, and to loom up again only when the skyline became a\nthing of smoke-banks, spires, and shafts. She had had only two weeks for\nthe actual transaction of her business. She must have been something of\na revelation to those Paris and Berlin manufacturers, accustomed though\nthey were to the brisk and irresistible methods of the American business\nwoman. She was, after all, absurdly young to be talking in terms\nof millions, and she was amazingly well dressed. This last passed\nunnoticed, or was taken for granted in Paris, but in Berlin, home of the\nfrump and the flour-sack figure, she was stared at, appreciatively. Her\nbusiness, except for one or two unimportant side lines, had to do with\ntwo factories on whose product the Haynes-Cooper company had long had a\ncovetous eye. Quantity, as usual, was the keynote of their demand,\nand Fanny's task was that of talking in six-figure terms to these\nconservative and over-wary foreign manufacturers. That she had\nsuccessfully accomplished this, and that she had managed to impress them\nalso with the important part that time and promptness in delivery played\nin a swift-moving machine like the Haynes-Cooper concern, was due to\nmany things beside her natural business ability. Self-confidence was\nthere, and physical vigor, and diplomacy. But above all there was that\nsheer love of the game; the dramatic sense that enabled her to see\nherself in the part. That alone precluded the possibility of failure.\nShe knew how youthful she looked, and how glowing. She anticipated the\nlook that came into their faces when she left polite small-talk behind\nand soared up into the cold, rarefied atmosphere of business. She\ndelighted in seeing the admiring and tolerant smirk vanish and give way\nto a startled and defensive attentiveness.\n\nIt might be mentioned that she managed, somehow, to spend almost half\na day in Petticoat Lane, and its squalid surroundings, while in London.\nShe actually prowled, alone, at night, in the evil-smelling, narrow\nstreets of the poorer quarter of Paris, and how she escaped unharmed is\na mystery that never bothered her, because she had never known fear of\nstreets. She had always walked on the streets of Winnebago, Wisconsin,\nalone. It never occurred to her not to do the same in the streets of\nChicago, or New York, or London, or Paris. She found Berlin, with\nits Adlon, its appalling cleanliness, its overfed populace, and its\nomnipresent Kaiser forever scudding up and down Unter den Linden in his\nchocolate-colored car, incredibly dull, and unpicturesque. Something she\nhad temporarily lost there in the busy atmosphere of the Haynes-Cooper\nplant, seemed to have returned, miraculously.\n\nNew York, on her return, was something of a shock. She remembered how\nvividly fresh it had looked to her on the day of that first visit,\nmonths before. Now, to eyes fresh from the crisp immaculateness of Paris\nand Berlin, Fifth avenue looked almost grimy, and certainly shabby in\nspots.\n\nElla Monahan, cheerful, congratulatory, beaming, met her at the pier,\nand Fanny was startled at her own sensation of happiness as she saw\nthat pink, good-natured face looking up at her from the crowd below. The\nmonth that had gone by since last she saw Ella standing just so, seemed\nto slip away and fade into nothingness.\n\n“I waited over a day,” said Ella, “just to see you. My, you look grand!\nI know where you got that hat. Galeries Lafayette. How much?”\n\n“I don't expect you to believe it. Thirty-five francs. Seven dollars. I\ncouldn't get it for twenty-five here.”\n\nThey were soon clear of the customs. Ella had engaged a room for her at\nthe hotel they always used. As they rode uptown together, happily, Ella\nopened her bag and laid a little packet of telegrams and letters in\nFanny's lap.\n\n“I guess Fenger's pleased, all right, if telegrams mean anything. Not\nthat I know they're from him. But he said--”\n\nBut Fanny was looking up from one of them with a startled expression.\n“He's here. Fenger's here.”\n\n“In New York?” asked Ella, rather dully.\n\n“Yes.” She ripped open another letter. It was from Theodore. He was\ncoming to New York in August. The Russian tour had been a brilliant\nsuccess. They had arranged a series of concerts for him in the United\nStates. He could give his concerto there. It was impossible in Russia,\nMunich, even Berlin, because it was distinctly Jewish in theme--as\nJewish as the Kol Nidre, and as somber. They would have none of it in\nEurope. Prejudice was too strong. But in America! He was happier than he\nhad been in years. Olga objected to coming to America, but she would\nget over that. The little one was well, and she was learning to talk.\nActually! They were teaching her to say Tante Fanny.\n\n“Well!” exclaimed Fanny, her eyes shining. She read bits of the letter\naloud to Ella. Ella was such a satisfactory sort of person to whom to\nread a letter aloud. She exclaimed in all the right places. Her face was\nas radiant as Fanny's. They both had forgotten all about Fenger, their\nChief. But they had been in their hotel scarcely a half hour, and Ella\nhad not done exclaiming over the bag that Fanny had brought her from\nParis, when his telephone call came.\n\nHe wasted very little time on preliminaries.\n\n“I'll call for you at four. We'll drive through the park, and out by the\nriver, and have tea somewhere.”\n\n“That would be wonderful. That is, if Ella's free. I'll ask her.”\n\n“Ella?”\n\n“Yes. She's right here. Hold the wire, will you?” She turned away from\nthe telephone to face Ella. “It's Mr. Fenger. He wants to take us both\ndriving this afternoon. You can go, can't you?”\n\n“I certainly CAN,” replied Miss Monahan, with what might have appeared\nto be undue force.\n\nFanny turned back to the telephone. “Yes, thanks. We can both go. We'll\nbe ready at four.”\n\nFanny decided that Fenger's muttered reply couldn't have been what she\nthought it was.\n\nElla busied herself with the unpacking of a bag. She showed a\ndisposition to spoil Fanny. “You haven't asked after your friend, Mr.\nHeyl. My land! If I had a friend like that--” “Oh, yes,” said Fanny,\nvaguely. “I suppose you and he are great chums by this time. He's a nice\nboy.”\n\n“You don't suppose anything of the kind,” Ella retorted, crisply. “That\nboy, as you call him--and it isn't always the man with the biggest fists\nthat's got the most fight in him--is about as far above me as--as--”\n she sat down on the floor, ponderously, beside the open bag, and\ngesticulated with a hairbrush, at loss for a simile “as an eagle is\nabove a waddling old duck. No, I don't mean that, either, because I\nnever did think much of the eagle, morally. But you get me. Not that\nhe knows it, or shows it. Heyl, I mean. Lord, no! But he's got\nsomething--something kind of spiritual in him that makes you that way,\ntoo. He doesn't say much, either. That's the funny part of it. I do all\nthe talking, seems, when I'm with him. But I find myself saying things\nI didn't know I knew. He makes you think about things you're afraid to\nface by yourself. Big things. Things inside of you.” She fell silent a\nmoment, sitting cross-legged before the bag. Then she got up, snapped\nthe bag shut, and bore it across the room to a corner. “You know he's\ngone, I s'pose.”\n\n“Gone?”\n\n“To those mountains, or wherever it is he gets that look in his eyes\nfrom. That's my notion of a job. They let him go for the whole summer,\nroaming around being a naturalist, just so's he'll come back in the\nwinter.”\n\n“And the column?” Fanny asked. “Do they let that go, too?”\n\n“I guess he's going to do some writing for them up there. After all,\nhe's the column. It doesn't make much difference where he writes from.\nDid you know it's being syndicated now, all over the country? Well, it\nis. That's the secret of its success, I suppose. It isn't only a column\nwritten about New York for a New York paper. It's about everything, for\nanybody. It's the humanest stuff. And he isn't afraid of anything. New\nYork's crazy about him. They say he's getting a salary you wouldn't\nbelieve. I'm a tongue-tied old fool when I'm with him, but then, he\nlikes to talk about you, mostly, so it doesn't matter.”\n\nFanny turned swiftly from the dressing-table, where she was taking the\npins out of her vigorous, abundant hair.\n\n“What kind of thing does he say about me, Ellen girl. H'm? What kind of\nthing?”\n\n“Abuse, mostly. I'll be running along to my own room now. I'll be out\nfor lunch, but back at four, for that airing Fenger's so wild to have\nme take. If I were you I'd lie down for an hour, till you get your\nland-legs.” She poked her head in at the door again. “Not that you\nlook as if you needed it. You've got a different look, somehow. Kind of\nrested. After all, there's nothing like an ocean voyage.”\n\nShe was gone. Fanny stood a moment, in the center of the room. There\nwas nothing relaxed or inert about her. Had you seen her standing there,\nmotionless, you would still have got a sense of action from her. She\nlooked so splendidly alive. She walked to the window, now, and stood\nlooking down upon New York in early June. Summer had not yet turned\nthe city into a cauldron of stone and steel. From her height she could\nglimpse the green of the park, with a glint of silver in its heart, that\nwas the lake. Her mind was milling around, aimlessly, in a manner far\nremoved from its usual orderly functioning. Now she thought of Theodore,\nher little brother--his promised return. It had been a slow and painful\nthing, his climb. Perhaps if she had been more ready to help, if she\nhad not always waited until he asked the aid that she might have\nvolunteered--she thrust that thought out of her mind, rudely, and\nslammed the door on it.... Fenger. He had said, “Damn!” when she had\ntold him about Ella. And his voice had been--well--she pushed that\nthought outside her mind, too.... Clarence Heyl.... “He makes you think\nabout things you're afraid to face by yourself. Big things. Things\ninside of you....”\n\nFanny turned away from the window. She decided she must be tired, after\nall. Because here she was, with everything to make her happy: Theodore\ncoming home; her foreign trip a success; Ella and Fenger to praise her\nand make much of her; a drive and tea this afternoon (she wasn't above\nthese creature comforts)--and still she felt unexhilarated, dull. She\ndecided to go down for a bit of lunch, and perhaps a stroll of ten\nor fifteen minutes, just to see what Fifth avenue was showing. It\nwas half-past one when she reached that ordinarily well-regulated\nthoroughfare. She found its sidewalks packed solid, up and down, as far\nas the eye could see, with a quiet, orderly, expectant mass of people.\nSquads of mounted police clattered up and down, keeping the middle\nof the street cleared. Whatever it was that had called forth that\nincredible mass, was scheduled to proceed uptown from far downtown, and\nthat very soon. Heads were turned that way. Fanny, wedged in the crowd,\nstood a-tiptoe, but she could see nothing. It brought to her mind the\nCircus Day of her Winnebago childhood, with Elm street packed with\ntownspeople and farmers, all straining their eyes up toward Cherry\nstreet, the first turn in the line of march. Then, far away, the blare\nof a band. “Here they come!” Just then, far down the canyon of Fifth\navenue, sounded the cry that had always swayed Elm street, Winnebago.\n“Here they come!”\n\n“What is it?” Fanny asked a woman against whom she found herself\nclose-packed. “What are they waiting for?”\n\n“It's the suffrage parade,” replied the woman. “The big suffrage parade.\nDon't you know?”\n\n“No. I haven't been here.” Fanny was a little disappointed. The crowd\nhad surged forward, so that it was impossible for her to extricate\nherself. She found herself near the curb. She could see down the broad\nstreet now, and below Twenty-third street it was a moving, glittering\nmass, pennants, banners, streamers flying. The woman next her\nvolunteered additional information.\n\n“The mayor refused permission to let them march. But they fought it, and\nthey say it's the greatest suffrage parade ever held. I'd march myself,\nonly--”\n\n“Only what?”\n\n“I don't know. I'm scared to, I think. I'm not a New Yorker.”\n\n“Neither am I,” said Fanny. Fanny always became friendly with the woman\nnext her in a crowd. That was her mother in her. One could hear the\nmusic of the band, now. Fanny glanced at her watch. It was not quite\ntwo. Oh, well, she would wait and see some of it. Her mind was still too\nfreshly packed with European impressions to receive any real idea of\nthe value of this pageant, she told herself. She knew she did not feel\nparticularly interested. But she waited.\n\nAnother surging forward. It was no longer, “Here they come!” but, “Here\nthey are!”\n\nAnd here they were.\n\nA squad of mounted police, on very prancy horses. The men looked very\nruddy, and well set-up and imposing. Fanny had always thrilled to\nanything in uniform, given sufficient numbers of them. Another police\nsquad. A brass band, on foot. And then, in white, on a snow-white\ncharger, holding a white banner aloft, her eyes looking straight ahead,\nher face very serious and youthful, the famous beauty and suffrage\nleader, Mildred Inness. One of the few famous beauties who actually\nwas a beauty. And after that women, women, women! Hundreds of them,\nthousands of them, a river of them flowing up Fifth avenue to the park.\nMore bands. More horses. Women! Women! They bore banners. This section,\nthat section. Artists. School teachers. Lawyers. Doctors. Writers. Women\nin college caps and gowns. Women in white, from shoes to hats. Young\nwomen. Girls. Gray-haired women. A woman in a wheel chair, smiling. A\nman next to Fanny began to jeer. He was a red-faced young man, with a\ncoarse, blotchy skin, and thick lips. He smoked a cigar, and called to\nthe women in a falsetto voice, “Hello, Sadie!” he called. “Hello, kid!”\n And the women marched on, serious-faced, calm-eyed. There came floats;\nelaborate affairs, with girls in Greek robes. Fanny did not care for\nthese. More solid ranks. And then a strange and pitiful and tragic\nand eloquent group. Their banner said, “Garment Workers. Infants' Wear\nSection.” And at their head marched a girl, carrying a banner. I don't\nknow how she attained that honor. I think she must have been one of\nthose fiery, eloquent leaders in her factory clique. The banner she\ncarried was a large one, and it flapped prodigiously in the breeze, and\nits pole was thick and heavy. She was a very small girl, even in that\ngroup of pale-faced, under-sized, under-fed girls. A Russian Jewess,\nevidently. Her shoes were ludicrous. They curled up at the toes, and the\nheels were run down. Her dress was a sort of parody on the prevailing\nfashion. But on her face, as she trudged along, hugging the pole of the\ngreat pennant that flapped in the breeze, was stamped a look.--well, you\nsee that same look in some pictures of Joan of Arc. It wasn't merely a\nlook. It was a story. It was tragedy. It was the history of a people.\nYou saw in it that which told of centuries of oppression in Russia. You\nsaw eager groups of student Intellectuals, gathered in secret places\nfor low-voiced, fiery talk. There was in it the unspeakable misery of\nSiberia. It spoke eloquently of pogroms, of massacres, of Kiev and its\nsister-horror, Kishineff. You saw mean and narrow streets, and carefully\ndarkened windows, and, on the other side of those windows the warm\nyellow glow of the seven-branched Shabbos light. Above this there shone\nthe courage of a race serene in the knowledge that it cannot die.\nAnd illuminating all, so that her pinched face, beneath the flapping\npennant, was the rapt, uplifted countenance of the Crusader, there\nblazed the great glow of hope. This woman movement, spoken of so glibly\nas Suffrage, was, to the mind of this over-read, under-fed, emotional,\ndreamy little Russian garment worker the glorious means to a long hoped\nfor end. She had idealized it, with the imagery of her kind. She had\nendowed it with promise that it would never actually hold for her,\nperhaps. And so she marched on, down the great, glittering avenue,\nproudly clutching her unwieldy banner, a stunted, grotesque, magnificent\nfigure. More than a figure. A symbol.\n\nFanny's eyes followed her until she passed out of sight. She put up her\nhand to her cheek, and her face was wet. She stood there, and the parade\nwent on, endlessly, it seemed, and she saw it through a haze. Bands.\nMore bands. Pennants. Floats. Women. Women. Women.\n\n“I always cry at parades,” said Fanny, to the woman who stood next\nher--the woman who wanted to march, but was scared to. “That's all\nright,” said the woman. “That's all right.” And she laughed, because she\nwas crying, too. And then she did a surprising thing. She elbowed her\nway to the edge of the crowd, past the red-faced man with the cigar,\nout to the street, and fell into line, and marched on up the street,\nshoulders squared, head high.\n\nFanny glanced down at her watch. It was quarter after four. With a\nlittle gasp she turned to work her way through the close-packed crowd.\nIt was an actual physical struggle, from which she emerged disheveled,\nbreathless, uncomfortably warm, and minus her handkerchief, but she had\ngained the comparative quiet of the side street, and she made the short\ndistance that lay between the Avenue and her hotel a matter of little\nmore than a minute. In the hotel corridor stood Ella and Fenger, the\nformer looking worried, the latter savage.\n\n“Where in the world--” began Ella.\n\n“Caught in the jam. And I didn't want to get out. It was--it\nwas--glorious!” She was shaking hands with Fenger, and realizing for the\nfirst time that she must be looking decidedly sketchy and that she had\nlost her handkerchief. She fished for it in her bag, hopelessly, when\nFenger released her hand. He had not spoken. Now he said:\n\n“What's the matter with your eyes?”\n\n“I've been crying,” Fanny confessed cheerfully.\n\n“Crying!”\n\n“The parade. There was a little girl in it--” she stopped. Fenger would\nnot be interested in that little girl. Now Clancy would have--but Ella\nbroke in on that thought.\n\n“I guess you don't realize that out in front of this hotel there's a\nkind of a glorified taxi waiting, with the top rolled back, and it's\nbeen there half an hour. I never expect to see the time when I could\nenjoy keeping a taxi waiting. It goes against me.”\n\n“I'm sorry. Really. Let's go. I'm ready.”\n\n“You are not. Your hair's a sight; and those eyes!”\n\nFenger put a hand on her arm. “Go on up and powder your nose, Miss\nBrandeis. And don't hurry. I want you to enjoy this drive.”\n\nOn her way up in the elevator Fanny thought, “He has lost his waistline.\nNow, that couldn't have happened in a month. Queer I didn't notice it\nbefore. And he looks soft. Not enough exercise.”\n\nWhen she rejoined them she was freshly bloused and gloved and all traces\nof the tell-tale red had vanished from her eyelids. Fifth avenue was\nimpossible. Their car sped up Madison avenue, and made for the Park. The\nPlaza was a jam of tired marchers. They dispersed from there, but there\nseemed no end to the line that still flowed up Fifth avenue. Fenger\nseemed scarcely to see it. He had plunged at once into talk of the\nEuropean trip. Fanny gave him every detail, omitting nothing. She\nrepeated all that her letters and cables had told. Fenger was more\nexcited than she had ever seen him. He questioned, cross-questioned,\ncriticized, probed, exacted an account of every conversation. Usually\nit was not method that interested him, but results. Fanny, having\naccomplished the thing she had set out to do, had lost interest in it\nnow. The actual millions so glibly bandied in the Haynes-Cooper plant\nhad never thrilled her. The methods by which they were made possible\nhad.\n\nElla had been listening with the shrewd comprehension of one who admires\nthe superior art of a fellow craftsman.\n\n“I'll say this, Mr. Fenger. If I could make you look like that, by going\nto Europe and putting it over those foreign boys, I'd feel I'd earned\na year's salary right there, and quit. Not to speak of the\ncross-examination you're putting her through.”\n\nFenger laughed, a little self-consciously. “It's just that I want to be\nsure it's real. I needn't tell you how important this trick is that Miss\nBrandeis has just turned.” He turned to Fanny, with a boyish laugh. “Now\ndon't pose. You know you can't be as bored as you look.”\n\n“Anyway,” put in Ella, briskly, “I move that the witness step down. She\nmay not be bored, but she certainly must be tired, and she's beginning\nto look it. Just lean back, Fanny, and let the green of this park soak\nin. At that, it isn't so awfully green, when you get right close, except\nthat one stretch of meadow. Kind of ugly, Central Park, isn't it? Bare.”\n\nFanny sat forward. There was more sparkle in her face than at any time\nduring the drive. They were skimming along those green-shaded drives\nthat are so sophisticatedly sylvan.\n\n“I used to think it was bare, too, and bony as an old maid, with no soft\ncuddly places like the parks at home; no gracious green stretches, and\nno rose gardens. But somehow, it grows on you. The reticence of it. And\nthat stretch of meadow near the Mall, in the late afternoon, with the\nmist on it, and the sky faintly pink, and that electric sign--Somebody's\nTires or other--winking off and on--”\n\n“You're a queer child,” interrupted Fenger. “As wooden as an Indian\nwhile talking about a million-a-year deal, and lyrical over a\ncombination of electric sign, sunset, and moth-eaten park. Oh, well,\nperhaps that's what makes you as you are.”\n\nEven Ella looked a little startled at that.\n\nThey had tea at Claremont, at a table overlooking the river and the\nPalisades. Fenger was the kind of man to whom waiters always give a\ntable overlooking anything that should be overlooked. After tea they\ndrove out along the river and came back in the cool of the evening.\nFanny was very quiet now. Fenger followed her mood. Ella sustained the\nconversation, somewhat doggedly. It was almost seven when they reached\nthe plaza exit. And there Fanny, sitting forward suddenly, gave a little\ncry.\n\n“Why--they're marching yet!” she said, and her voice was high with\nwonder. “They're marching yet! All the time we've been driving and\nteaing, they've been marching.”\n\nAnd so they had. Thousands upon thousands, they had flowed along as\nrelentlessly, and seemingly as endlessly as a river. They were marching\nyet. For six hours the thousands had poured up that street, making it a\nmoving mass of white. And the end was not yet. What pen, and tongue, and\nsense of justice had failed to do, they were doing now by sheer, crude\nforce of numbers. The red-faced hooligan, who had stood next to Fanny\nin the crowd hours before, had long ago ceased his jibes and slunk away,\nbored, if not impressed. After all, one might jeer at ten, or fifty, or\na hundred women, or even five hundred. But not at forty thousand.\n\nTheir car turned down Madison Avenue, and Fenger twisted about for a\nlast look at the throng in the plaza. He was plainly impressed. The\nmagnitude of the thing appealed to him. To a Haynes-Cooper-trained\nmind, forty thousand women, marching for whatever the cause, must\nbe impressive. Forty thousand of anything had the respect of Michael\nFenger. His eyes narrowed, thoughtfully.\n\n“They seem to have put it over,” he said. “And yet, what's the idea?\nOh, I'm for suffrage, of course. Naturally. And all those thousands of\nwomen, in white--still, a thing as huge as this parade has to be reduced\nto a common denominator, to be really successful. If somebody could take\nthe whole thing, boil it down, and make the country see what this huge\ndemonstration stands for.”\n\nFanny leaned forward suddenly. “Tell the man to stop. I want to get\nout.”\n\nFenger and Ella stared. “What for?” But Fenger obeyed.\n\n“I want to get something at this stationer's shop.” She had jumped down\nalmost before the motor had stopped at the curb.\n\n“But let me get it.”\n\n“No. You can't. Wait here.” She disappeared within the shop. She was\nback in five minutes, a flat, loosely wrapped square under her arm.\n“Cardboard,” she explained briefly, in answer to their questions.\n\nFenger, about to leave them at their hotel, presented his plans for the\nevening. Fanny, looking up at him, her head full of other plans, thought\nhe looked and sounded very much like Big Business. And, for the moment\nat least, Fanny Brandeis loathed Big Business, and all that it stood\nfor.\n\n“It's almost seven,” Fenger was saying. “We'll be rubes in New York,\nthis evening. You girls will just have time to freshen up a bit--I\nsuppose you want to--and then we'll have dinner, and go to the theater,\nand to supper afterward. What do you want to see?”\n\nElla looked at Fanny. And Fanny shook her head, “Thanks. You're awfully\nkind. But--no.”\n\n“Why not?” demanded Fenger, gruffly.\n\n“Perhaps because I'm tired. And there's something else I must do.”\n\nElla looked relieved. Fenger's eyes bored down upon Fanny, but she\nseemed not to feel them. She held out her hand.\n\n“You're going back to-morrow?” Fenger asked. “I'm not leaving until\nThursday.”\n\n“To-morrow, with Ella. Good-by. It's been a glorious drive. I feel quite\nrested.”\n\n“You just said you were tired.”\n\nThe elevator door clanged, shutting out the sight of Fenger's resentful\nfrown.\n\n“He's as sensitive as a soubrette,” said Ella. “I'm glad you decided not\nto go out. I'm dead, myself. A kimono for the rest of the evening.”\n\nFanny seemed scarcely to hear her. With a nod she left Ella, and entered\nher own room. There she wasted no time. She threw her hat and coat on\nthe bed. Her suitcase was on the baggage stand. She turned on all the\nlights, swung the closed suitcase up to the table, shoved the table\nagainst the wall, up-ended the suitcase so that its leather side\npresented a smooth surface, and propped a firm sheet of white cardboard\nagainst the impromptu rack. She brought her chair up close, fumbled in\nher bag for the pens she had just purchased. Her eyes were on the blank\nwhite surface of the paper. The table was the kind that has a sub-shelf.\nIt prevented Fanny from crossing her legs under it, and that bothered\nher. While she fitted her pens, and blocked her paper, she kept on\nbarking her shins in unconscious protest against the uncomfortable\nconditions under which she must work.\n\nShe sat staring at the paper now, after having marked it off into\nblocks, with a pencil. She got up, and walked across the room,\naimlessly, and stood there a moment, and came back. She picked up a\nthread on the floor. Sat down again. Picked up her pencil, rolled it a\nmoment in her palms, then, catching her toes behind either foreleg of\nher chair, in an attitude that was as workmanlike as it was ungraceful,\nshe began to draw, nervously, tentatively at first, but gaining in\nfirmness and assurance as she went on.\n\nIf you had been standing behind her chair you would have seen, emerging\nmiraculously from the white surface under Fanny's pencil, a thin,\nundersized little figure in sleazy black and white, whose face, under\nthe cheap hat, was upturned and rapturous. Her skirts were wind-blown,\nand the wind tugged, too, at the banner whose pole she hugged so tightly\nin her arms. Dimly you could see the crowds that lined the street on\neither side. Vaguely, too, you saw the faces and stunted figures of the\nlittle group of girls she led. But she, the central figure, stood out\namong all the rest. Fanny Brandeis, the artist, and Fanny Brandeis, the\nsalesman, combined shrewdly to omit no telling detail. The wrong kind of\nfeet in the wrong kind of shoes; the absurd hat; the shabby skirt--every\nbit of grotesquerie was there, serving to emphasize the glory of the\nface. Fanny Brandeis' face, as the figure grew, line by line, was a\nglorious thing, too.\n\nShe was working rapidly. She laid down her pencil, now, and leaned back,\nsquinting her eyes critically. She looked grimly pleased. Her hair was\nrather rumpled, and her cheeks very pink. She took up her pen, now, and\nbegan to ink her drawing with firm black strokes. As she worked a little\ncrow of delight escaped her--the same absurd crow of triumph that had\nsounded that day in Winnebago, years and years before, when she,\na school girl in a red tam o' shanter, had caught the likeness of\nSchabelitz, the peasant boy, under the exterior of Schabelitz, the\nfamous. There sounded a smart little double knock at her door. Fanny\ndid not heed it. She did not hear it. Her toes were caught behind the\nchair-legs again. She was slumped down on the middle of her spine. She\nhad brought the table, with its ridiculously up-ended suitcase, very\nnear, so that she worked with a minimum of effort. The door opened.\nFanny did not turn her head. Ella Monahan came in, yawning. She was\nwearing an expensive looking silk kimono that fell in straight, simple\nfolds, and gave a certain majesty to her ample figure.\n\n“Well, what in the world--” she began, and yawned again, luxuriously.\nShe stopped behind Fanny's chair and glanced over her shoulder. The yawn\ndied. She craned her neck a little, and leaned forward. And the little\ngirl went marching by, in her cheap and crooked shoes, and her short\nand sleazy skirt, with the banner tugging, tugging in the breeze.\nFanny Brandeis had done her with that economy of line, and absence\nof sentimentality which is the test separating the artist from the\ndraughtsman.\n\nSilence, except for the scratching of Fanny Brandeis's pen.\n\n“Why--the poor little kike!” said Ella Monahan. Then, after another\nmoment of silence, “I didn't know you could draw like that.”\n\nFanny laid down her pen. “Like what?” She pushed back her chair, and\nrose, stiffly. The drawing, still wet, was propped up against the\nsuitcase. Fanny walked across the room. Ella dropped into her chair, so\nthat when Fanny came back to the table it was she who looked over Ella's\nshoulder. Into Ella's shrewd and heavy face there had come a certain\nlook.\n\n“They don't get a square deal, do they? They don't get a square deal.”\n\nThe two looked at the girl a moment longer, in silence. Then Fanny went\nover to the bed, and picked up her hat and coat. She smoothed her hair,\ndeftly, powdered her nose with care, and adjusted her hat at the smart\nangle approved by the Galeries Lafayette. She came back to the table,\npicked up her pen, and beneath the drawing wrote, in large print:\n\nTHE MARCHER.\n\n\nShe picked up the drawing, still wet, opened the door, and with a smile\nat the bewildered Ella, was gone.\n\nIt was after eight o'clock when she reached the Star building. She asked\nfor Lasker's office, and sent in her card. Heyl had told her that Lasker\nwas always at his desk at eight. Now, Fanny Brandeis knew that the\naverage young woman, standing outside the office of a man like Lasker,\nunknown and at the mercy of office boy or secretary, continues to stand\noutside until she leaves in discouragement. But Fanny knew, too, that\nshe was not an average young woman. She had, on the surface, an air\nof authority and distinction. She had that quiet assurance of one\naccustomed to deference. She had youth, and beauty, and charm. She had a\nhat and suit bought in Paris, France; and a secretary is only human.\n\nCarl Lasker's private office was the bare, bright, newspaper-strewn room\nof a man who is not only a newspaper proprietor, but a newspaper man.\nThere's a difference. Carl Lasker had sold papers on the street when he\nwas ten. He had slept on burlap sacks, paper stuffed, in the basement\nof a newspaper office. Ink flowed with the blood in his veins. He could\noperate a press. He could manipulate a linotype machine (that almost\nhumanly intelligent piece of mechanism). He could make up a paper single\nhanded, and had done it. He knew the newspaper game, did Carl Lasker,\nfrom the composing room to the street, and he was a very great man in\nhis line. And so he was easy to reach, and simple to talk to, as are all\ngreat men.\n\nA stocky man, decidedly handsome, surprisingly young, well dressed,\nsmooth shaven, direct.\n\nFanny entered. Lasker laid down her card. “Brandeis. That's a good\nname.” He extended his hand. He wore evening clothes, with a white\nflower in his buttonhole. He must have just come from a dinner, or he\nwas to attend a late affair, somewhere. Perhaps Fanny, taken aback,\nunconsciously showed her surprise, because Lasker grinned, as he waved\nher to a chair. His quick mind had interpreted her thought.\n\n“Sit down, Miss Brandeis. You think I'm gotten up like the newspaper\nman in a Richard Harding Davis short story, don't you? What can I do for\nyou?”\n\nFanny wasted no words. “I saw the parade this afternoon. I did a\npicture. I think it's good. If you think so too, I wish you'd use it.”\n\nShe laid it, face up, on Lasker's desk. Lasker picked it up in his two\nhands, held it off, and scrutinized it. All the drama in the world is\nconcentrated in the confines of a newspaper office every day in the\nyear, and so you hear very few dramatic exclamations in such a place.\nMen like Lasker do not show emotion when impressed. It is too wearing\non the mechanism. Besides, they are trained to self-control. So Lasker\nsaid, now:\n\n“Yes, I think it's pretty good, too.” Then, raising his voice to a\nsudden bellow, “Boy!” He handed the drawing to a boy, gave a few brief\norders, and turned back to Fanny. “To-morrow morning every other paper\nin New York will have pictures showing Mildred Inness, the beauty, on\nher snow-white charger, or Sophronisba A. Bannister, A.B., Ph.D., in her\ncap and gown, or Mrs. William Van der Welt as Liberty. We'll have that\nlittle rat with the banner, and it'll get 'em. They'll talk about it.”\n His eyes narrowed a little. “Do you always get that angle?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“There isn't a woman cartoonist in New York who does that human stuff.\nDid you know that?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Want a job?”\n\n“N-no.”\n\nHis knowing eye missed no detail of the suit, the hat, the gloves, the\nshoes.\n\n“What's your salary now?”\n\n“Ten thousand.”\n\n“Satisfied?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“You've hit the heart of that parade. I don't know whether you could do\nthat every day, or not. But if you struck twelve half the time, it would\nbe enough. When you want a job, come back.”\n\n“Thanks,” said Fanny quietly. And held out her hand.\n\nShe returned in the subway. It was a Bronx train, full of sagging faces,\nlusterless eyes, grizzled beards; of heavy, black-eyed girls in soiled\nwhite shoes; of stoop-shouldered men, poring over newspapers in Hebrew\nscript; of smells and sounds and glaring light.\n\nAnd though to-morrow would bring its reaction, and common sense would\nhave her again in its cold grip, she was radiant to-night and glowing\nwith the exaltation that comes with creation. And over and over a voice\nwithin her was saying:\n\nThese are my people! These are my people!\n\n\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\n\nThe ship that brought Theodore Brandeis to America was the last of\nits kind to leave German ports for years. The day after he sailed from\nBremen came the war. Fanny Brandeis was only one of the millions of\nAmericans who refused to accept the idea of war. She took it as a\npersonal affront. It was uncivilized, it was old fashioned, it was\ninconvenient. Especially inconvenient. She had just come from Europe,\nwhere she had negotiated a million-dollar deal. War would mean that she\ncould not get the goods ordered. Consequently there could be no war.\n\nTheodore landed the first week in August. Fanny stole two days from the\nravenous bins to meet him in New York. I think she must have been a very\nlove-hungry woman in the years since her mother's death. She had never\nadmitted it. But only emotions denied to the point of starvation could\nhave been so shaken now at the thought of the feast before them. She had\ntrained herself to think of him as Theodore the selfish, Theodore the\ncallous, Theodore the voracious. “An unsuccessful genius,” she\ntold herself. “He'll be impossible. They're bad enough when they're\nsuccessful.”\n\nBut now her eyes, her thoughts, her longings, her long-pent emotions\nwere straining toward the boat whose great prow was looming toward her,\na terrifying bulk. The crowd awaiting the ship was enormous. A dramatic\nenough scene at any time, the great Hoboken pier this morning was filled\nwith an unrehearsed mob, anxious, thrilled, hysterical. The morning\npapers had carried wireless news that the ship had been chased by a\nFrench gunboat and had escaped only through the timely warning of the\nDresden, a German gunboat. That had added the last fillip to an already\ntense situation. Tears were streaming down half the faces upturned\ntoward the crowded decks. And from every side:\n\n“Do you see her?”\n\n“That's Jessie. There she is! Jessie!”\n\n“Heh! Jim, old boy! Come on down!”\n\nFanny's eyes were searching the packed rails. “Ted!” she called,\nand choked back a sob. “Teddy!” Still she did not see him. She was\nsearching, womanlike, for a tall, blondish boy, with a sulky mouth, and\nhumorous eyes, and an unruly lock of hair that would insist on escaping\nfrom the rest and straggling down over his forehead. I think she was\neven looking for a boy with a violin in his arms. A boy in knickers.\nWomen lose all sense of time and proportion at such times. Still she did\nnot see him. The passengers were filing down the gangplank now; rushing\ndown as quickly as the careful hands of the crew would allow them, and\nhurling themselves into the arms of friends and family crowded below.\nFanny strained her eyes toward that narrow passageway, anxious, hopeful,\nfearful, heartsick. For the moment Olga and the baby did not exist for\nher. And then she saw him.\n\nShe saw him through an unimaginable disguise. She saw him, and knew\nhim in spite of the fact that the fair-haired, sulky, handsome boy had\nvanished, and in his place walked a man. His hair was close-cropped,\nGerman-fashion; his face careworn and older than she had ever thought\npossible; his bearing, his features, his whole personality stamped\nwith an unmistakable distinction. And his clothes were appallingly,\ninconceivably German. So she saw him, and he was her brother, and she\nwas his sister, and she stretched out her arms to him.\n\n“Teddy!” She hugged him close, her face buried in his shoulder. “Teddy,\nyou--you Spitzbube you!” She laughed at that, a little hysterically.\n“Not that I know what a Spitzbube is, but it's the Germanest word I\ncan think of.” That shaven head. Those trousers. That linen. The awful\nboots. The tie! “Oh, Teddy, and you're the Germanest thing I ever saw.”\n She kissed him again, rapturously.\n\nHe kissed her, too, wordlessly at first. They moved aside a little, out\nof the crowd. Then he spoke for the first time.\n\n“God! I'm glad to see you, Fanny.” There was tragedy, not profanation\nin his voice. His hand gripped hers. He turned, and now, for the\nfirst time, Fanny saw that at his elbow stood a buxom, peasant woman,\nevidently a nurse, and in her arms a child. A child with Molly Brandeis'\nmouth, and Ferdinand Brandeis' forehead, and Fanny Brandeis' eyes, and\nTheodore Brandeis' roseleaf skin, and over, and above all these,\nweaving in and out through the whole, an expression or cast--a vague,\nundefinable thing which we call a resemblance--that could only have come\nfrom the woman of the picture, Theodore Brandeis' wife, Olga.\n\n“Why--it's the baby!” cried Fanny, and swung her out of the nurse's\nprotesting arms. Such a German-looking baby. Such an adorably\nGerman-looking baby. “Du kleine, du!” Fanny kissed the roseleaf cheek.\n“Du suszes--” She turned suddenly to Theodore. “Olga--where's Olga?”\n\n“She did not come.”\n\nFanny tightened her hold of the little squirming bundle in her arms.\n“Didn't come?”\n\nTheodore shook his head, dumbly. In his eyes was an agony of pain. And\nsuddenly all those inexplicable things in his face were made clear to\nFanny. She placed the little Mizzi in the nurse's arms again. “Then\nwe'll go, dear. They won't be a minute over your trunks, I'm sure. Just\nfollow me.”\n\nHer arm was linked through Theodore's. Her hand was on his. Her head\nwas up. Her chin was thrust out, and she never knew how startlingly she\nresembled the Molly Brandeis who used to march so bravely down Norris\nstreet on her way to Brandeis' Bazaar. She was facing a situation, and\nshe recognized it. There was about her an assurance, a composure, a\nblithe capability that imparted itself to the three bewildered and\nhelpless ones in her charge. Theodore felt it, and the strained look\nin his face began to lift just a little. The heavy-witted peasant woman\nfelt it, and trudged along, cheerfully. The baby in her arms seemed to\nsense it, and began to converse volubly and unintelligibly with the blue\nuniformed customs inspector.\n\nThey were out of the great shed in an incredibly short time. Fanny\nseemed equal to every situation. She had taken the tube to Hoboken, but\nnow she found a commodious open car, and drove a shrewd bargain with the\nchauffeur. She bundled the three into it. Of the three, perhaps Theodore\nseemed the most bewildered and helpless. He clung to his violin and\nFanny.\n\n“I feel like an immigrant,” he said. “Fan, you're a wonder. You don't\nknow how much you look and act like mother. I've been watching you. It's\nstartling.”\n\nFanny laughed and took his hand, and held his hand up to her breast,\nand crushed it there. “And you look like an illustration out of the\nFliegende Blaetter. It isn't only your clothes. Your face is German.\nAs for Mizzi here--” she gathered the child in her arms again--“you've\nnever explained that name to me. Why, by the way, Mizzi? Of all the\nnames in the world.”\n\nTheodore smiled a wry little smile. “Mizzi is named after Olga's chum.\nYou see, in Vienna every other--well, chorus girl I suppose you'd\ncall them--is named Mizzi. Like all the Gladyses and Flossies here in\nAmerica. Well, Olga's special friend Mizzi--”\n\n“I see,” said Fanny quietly. “Well, anything's better than Fanny. Always\ndid make me think of an old white horse.” And at that the small German\nperson in her arms screwed her mouth into a fascinating bunch, and then\nunscrewed it and, having made these preparations said, “Tante Fanny.\nShecago. Tante Fanny.”\n\n“Why, Mizzi Brandeis, you darling! Teddy, did you hear that! She said\n`Tante Fanny' and `Chicago' just as plainly!” “Did I hear it? Have I\nheard anything else for weeks?”\n\nThe plump person on the opposite seat, who had been shaking her head\nviolently all this time here threatened to burst if not encouraged to\nspeak. Fanny nodded to her. Whereupon the flood broke.\n\n“Wunderbar, nicht war! Ich kuss' die handt, gnadiges Fraulein.” She\nactually did it, to Fanny's consternation. “Ich hab' ihr das gelernt,\nGnadige. Selbst. Ist es nicht ganz entzuckend! Tante Fanny. Auch\nShecago.”\n\nFanny nodded a number of times, first up and down, signifying assent,\nthen sideways, signifying unbounded wonder and admiration. She made a\ngigantic effort to summon her forgotten German.\n\n“Was ist Ihre Name?” she managed to ask.\n\n“Otti.”\n\n“Oh, my!” exclaimed Fanny, weakly. “Mizzi and Otti. It sounds like the\nfirst act of the `Merry Widow.'” She turned to Theodore. “I wish you'd\nsit back, and relax, and if you must clutch that violin case, do it\nmore comfortably. I don't want you to tell me a thing, now. New York is\nghastly in August. We'll get a train out of here to-morrow. My apartment\nin Chicago is cool, and high, and quiet, and the lake is in the front\nyard, practically. To-night, perhaps, we'll talk about--things. And, oh,\nTeddy, how glad I am to see you--to have you--to--” she put out a hand\nand patted his thin cheek--“to touch you.”\n\nAnd at that the man became a boy again. His face worked a moment,\npainfully and then his head came down in her lap that held the baby,\nand so she had them both for a moment, one arm about the child, one hand\nsmoothing the boy's close-cropped hair. And in that moment she was more\nsplendidly maternal than either of the women who had borne these whom\nshe now comforted.\n\nIt was Fanny who attended to the hotel rooms, to the baby's comfort, to\nthe railroad tickets, to the ordering of the meals. Theodore was like a\nstranger in a strange land. Not only that, he seemed dazed.\n\n“We'll have it out to-night,” Fanny said to herself. “He'll never\nget that look off his face until he has told it all. I knew she was a\nbeast.”\n\nShe made him lie down while she attended to schedules, tickets, berths.\nShe was gone for two hours. When she returned she found him looking\namused, terrified and helpless, all at once, while three men reporters\nand one woman special writer bombarded him with questions. The woman\nhad brought a staff artist with her, and he was now engaged in making a\nbungling sketch of Theodore's face, with its ludicrous expression.\n\nFanny sensed the situation and saved it. She hadn't sold goods all these\nyears without learning the value of advertising. She came forward now,\ngraciously (but not too graciously). Theodore looked relieved. Already\nhe had learned that one might lean on this sister who was so capable, so\nbountifully alive.\n\n“Teddy, you're much too tired to talk. Let me talk for you.”\n\n“My sister, Miss Brandeis,” said Teddy, and waved a rather feeble hand\nin an inclusive gesture at the interrogatory five.\n\nFanny smiled. “Do sit down,” she said, “all of you. Tell me, how did you\nhappen to get on my brother's trail?”\n\nOne of the men explained. “We had a list of ship's passengers, of\ncourse. And we knew that Mr. Brandeis was a German violinist. And then\nthe story of the ship being chased by a French boat. We just missed him\ndown at the pier--”\n\n“But he isn't a German violinist,” interrupted Fanny. “Please get that\nstraight. He's American. He is THE American violinist--or will be, as\nsoon as his concert tour here is well started. It was Schabelitz\nhimself who discovered my brother, and predicted his brilliant career.\nHere”--she had been glancing over the artist's shoulder--“will you let\nme make a sketch for you--just for the fun of the thing? I do that kind\nof thing rather decently. Did you see my picture called `The Marcher,'\nin the Star, at the time of the suffrage parade in May? Yes, that was\nmine. Just because he has what we call a butcher haircut, don't think\nhe's German, because he isn't. You wouldn't call Winnebago, Wisconsin,\nGermany, would you?”\n\nShe was sketching him swiftly, daringly, masterfully. She was bringing\nout the distinction, the suffering, the boyishness in his face, and\ntoning down the queer little foreign air he had. Toning it, but not\nomitting it altogether. She was too good a showman for that. As she\nsketched she talked, and as she talked she drew Theodore into the\nconversation, deftly, and just when he was needed. She gave them what\nthey had come for--a story. And a good one. She brought in Mizzi and\nOtti, for color, and she saw to it that they spelled those names as they\nshould be spelled. She managed to gloss over the question of Olga. Ill.\nDetained. Last minute. Too brave to sacrifice her husband's American\ntour. She finished her sketch and gave it to the woman reporter. It was\nan amazingly compelling little piece of work--and yet, not so amazing,\nperhaps, when you consider the thing that Fanny Brandeis had put into\nit. Then she sent them away, tactfully. They left, knowing all that\nFanny Brandeis had wanted them to know; guessing little that she had\nnot wanted them to guess. More than that no human being can accomplish,\nwithout the advice of his lawyer.\n\n“Whew!” from Fanny, when the door had closed.\n\n“Gott im Himmel!” from Theodore. “I had forgotten that America was like\nthat.”\n\n“But America IS like that. And Teddy, we're going to make it sit up and\ntake notice.”\n\nAt that Theodore drooped again. Fanny thought that he looked startlingly\nas she remembered her father had looked in those days of her childhood,\nwhen Brandeis' Bazaar was slithering downhill. The sight of him moved\nher to a sudden resolve. She crossed swiftly to him, and put one\nheartening hand on his shoulder.\n\n“Come on, brother. Out with it. Let's have it all now.”\n\nHe reached up for her hand and held it, desperately. “Oh, Fan!” began\nTheodore, “Fan, I've been through hell.”\n\nFanny said nothing. She only waited, quietly, encouragingly. She had\nlearned when not to talk. Presently he took up his story, plunging\ndirectly into it, as though sensing that she had already divined much.\n\n“She married me for a living. You'll think that's a joke, knowing what\nI was earning there, in Vienna, and how you and mother were denying\nyourselves everything to keep me. But in a city that circulates a\ncoin valued at a twentieth of a cent, an American dollar looms up\nbig. Besides, two of the other girls had got married. Good for nothing\nofficers. She was jealous, I suppose. I didn't know any of that. I was\nflattered to think she'd notice me. She was awfully popular. She has\na kind of wit. I suppose you'd call it that. The other girls were just\ncoarse, and heavy, and--well--animal. You can't know the rottenness of\nlife there in Vienna. Olga could keep a whole supper table laughing all\nevening. I can see, now, that that isn't difficult when your audience\nis made up of music hall girls, and stupid, bullet-headed officers, with\ntheir damned high collars, and their gold braid, and their silly swords,\nand their corsets, and their glittering shoes and their miserable petty\npoverty beneath all the show. I thought I was a lucky boy. I'd have\npitied everybody in Winnebago, if I'd ever thought of anybody in\nWinnebago. I never did, except once in a while of you and mother when\nI needed money. I kept on with my music. I had sense enough left, for\nthat. Besides, it was a habit, by that time. Well, we were married.”\n\nHe laughed, an ugly, abrupt little laugh that ended in a moan, and\nturned his head and buried his face in Fanny's breast. And Fanny's arm\nwas there, about his shoulder. “Fanny, you don't--I can't--” He stopped.\nAnother silence. Fanny's arm tightened its hold. She bent and kissed the\ntop of the stubbly head, bowed so low now. “Fan, do you remember that\nwoman in `The Three Musketeers'? The hellish woman, that all men\nloved and loathed? Well, Olga's like that. I'm not whining. I'm not\nexaggerating. I'm just trying to make you understand. And yet I don't\nwant you to understand. Only you don't know what it means to have you to\ntalk to. To have some one who”--he clutched her hand, fearfully--“You do\nlove me, don't you, Fanny? You do, don't you, Sis?”\n\n“More than any one in the world,” Fanny reassured him, quietly. “The way\nmother would have, if she had lived.”\n\nA sigh escaped him, at that, as though a load had lifted from him. He\nwent on, presently. “It would have been all right if I could have earned\njust a little more money.” Fanny shrank at that, and shut her eyes for\na sick moment. “But I couldn't. I asked her to be patient. But you don't\nknow the life there. There is no real home life. They live in the cafes.\nThey go there to keep warm, in the winter, and to meet their friends,\nand gossip, and drink that eternal coffee, and every coffee house--there\nare thousands--is a rendezvous. We had two rooms, comfortable ones, for\nVienna, and I tried to explain to her that if I could work hard, and\nget into concert, and keep at the composing, we'd be rich some day, and\nfamous, and happy, and she'd have clothes, and jewels. But she was too\nstupid, or too bored. Olga is the kind of woman who only believes what\nshe sees. Things got worse all the time. She had a temper. So have\nI--or I used to have. But when hers was aroused it was--horrible. Words\nthat--that--unspeakable words. And one day she taunted me with being a\n----with my race. The first time she called me that I felt that I must\nkill her. That was my mistake. I should have killed her. And I didn't.”\n\n“Teddy boy! Don't, brother! You're tired. You're excited and worn out.”\n\n“No, I'm not. Just let me talk. I know what I'm saying. There's\nsomething clean about killing.” He brooded a moment over that thought.\nThen he went on, doggedly, not raising his voice. His hands were clasped\nloosely. “You don't know about the intolerance and the anti-Semitism\nin Prussia, I suppose. All through Germany, for that matter. In Bavaria\nit's bitter. That's one reason why Olga loathed Munich so. The queer\npart of it is that all that opposition seemed to fan something in me;\nsomething that had been smoldering for a long time.” His voice had lost\nits dull tone now. It had in it a new timbre. And as he talked he began\nto interlard his English with bits of German, the language to which his\ntongue had accustomed itself in the past ten years. His sentences, too,\ntook on a German construction, from time to time. He was plainly excited\nnow. “My playing began to improve. There would be a ghastly scene with\nOlga--sickening--degrading. Then I would go to my work, and I would\nplay, but magnificently! I tell you, it would be playing. I know. To\nfool myself I know better. One morning, after a dreadful quarrel I got\nthe idea for the concerto, and the psalms. Jewish music. As Jewish as\nthe Kol Nidre. I wanted to express the passion, and fire, and history of\na people. My people. Why was that? Tell me. Selbst, weiss ich nicht.\nI felt that if I could put into it just a millionth part of their\nhumiliation, and their glory; their tragedy and their triumph; their\nsorrow, and their grandeur; their persecution, their weldtschmerz.\nVolkschmerz. That was it. And through it all, weaving in and out, one\ngreat underlying motif. Indestructibility. The great cry which says, `We\ncannot be destroyed!'”\n\nHe stood up, uncertainly. His eyes were blazing. He began to walk up\nand down the luxurious little room. Fanny's eyes matched his. She was\nstaring at him, fascinated, trembling.\n\nShe moistened her lips a little with her tongue. “And you've done it?\nTeddy! You've done--that!”\n\nTheodore Brandeis stood up, very straight and tall. “Yes,” he said,\nsimply. “Yes, I've done that.”\n\nShe came over to him then, and put her two hands on his shoulders.\n“Ted--dear--will you ever forgive me? I'll try to make up for it now.\nI didn't know. I've been blind. Worse than blind. Criminal.” She was\nweeping now, broken-heartedly, and he was patting her with little\ncomforting love pats, and whispering words of tenderness.\n\n“Forgive you? Forgive you what?”\n\n“The years of suffering. The years you've had to spend with her. With\nthat horrible woman--”\n\n“Don't--” He sucked his breath between his teeth. His face had gone\nhaggard again. Fanny, direct as always, made up her mind that she would\nhave it all. And now.\n\n“There's something you haven't told me. Tell me all of it. You're my\nbrother and I'm your sister. We're all we have in the world.” And at\nthat, as though timed by some miraculous and supernatural stage manager,\nthere came a cry from the next room; a sleepy, comfortable, imperious\nlittle cry. Mizzi had awakened. Fanny made a step in the direction of\nthe door. Then she turned back. “Tell me why Olga didn't come. Why isn't\nshe here with her husband and baby?”\n\n“Because she's with another man.”\n\n“Another--”\n\n“It had been going on for a long time. I was the last to know about it.\nIt's that way, always, isn't it? He's an officer. A fool. He'll have\nto take off his silly corsets now, and his velvet collar, and his shiny\nboots, and go to war. Damn him! I hope they'll kill him with a hundred\nbayonets, one by one, and leave him to rot on the field. She had been\nfooling me all the time, and they had been laughing at me, the two of\nthem. I didn't find it out until just before this American trip. And\nwhen I confronted her with it she laughed in my face. She said she hated\nme. She said she'd rather starve than leave him to come to America with\nme. She said I was a fiddling fool. She--” he was trembling and sick\nwith the shame of it--“God! I can't tell you the things she said.\nShe wanted to keep Mizzi. Isn't that strange? She loves the baby. She\nneglects her, and spoils her, and once I saw her beat her, in a rage.\nBut she says she loves my Mizzi, and I believe she does, in her own\ndreadful way. I promised her, and lied to her, and then I ran away with\nMizzi and her nurse.”\n\n“Oh, I thank God for that!” Fanny cried. “I thank God for that! And now,\nTeddy boy, we'll forget all about those miserable years. We'll forget\nall about her, and the life she led you. You're going to have your\nchance here. You're going to be repaid for every minute of suffering\nyou've endured. I'll make it up to you. And when you see them applauding\nyou, calling for you, adoring you, all those hideous years will fade\nfrom your mind, and you'll be Theodore Brandeis, the successful,\nTheodore Brandeis, the gifted, Theodore Brandeis, the great! You need\nnever think of her again. You'll never see her again. That beast! That\nwoman!”\n\nAnd at that Theodore's face became distorted and dreadful with pain. He\nraised two impotent, shaking arms high above his head. “That's just it!\nThat's just it! You don't know what love is. You don't know what hate\nis. You don't know how I hate myself. Loathe myself. She's all that's\nmiserable, all that's unspeakable, all that's vile. And if she called\nme to-day I'd come. That's it.” He covered his shamed face with his two\nhands, so that the words came from him slobberingly, sickeningly. “I\nhate her! I hate her! And I want her. I want her. I want her!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n\nIf Fanny Brandeis, the deliberately selfish, the calculatingly\nambitious, was aghast at the trick fate had played her, she kept her\nthoughts to herself. Knowing her, I think she must have been grimly\namused at finding herself saddled with a helpless baby, a bewildered\npeasant woman, and an artist brother both helpless and bewildered.\n\nIt was out of the question to house them in her small apartment. She\nfound a furnished apartment near her own, and installed them there, with\na working housekeeper in charge. She had a gift for management, and she\narranged all these details with a brisk capability that swept everything\nbefore it. A sunny bedroom for Mizzi. But then, a bright living room,\ntoo, for Theodore's hours of practice. No noise. Chicago's roar maddened\nhim. Otti shied at every new contrivance that met her eye. She had to\nbe broken in to elevators, electric switches, hot and cold faucets,\nradiators.\n\n“No apartment ever built could cover all the requirements,” Fanny\nconfided to Fenger, after the first harrowing week. “What they really\nneed is a combination palace, houseboat, sanatorium, and creche.”\n\n“Look here,” said Fenger. “If I can help, why--” a sudden thought struck\nhim. “Why don't you bring 'em all down to my place in the country? We're\nnot there half the time. It's too cool for my wife in September. Just\nthe thing for the child, and your brother could fiddle his head off.”\n\nThe Fengers had a roomy, wide-verandaed house near Lake Forest; one\nof the many places of its kind that dot the section known as the north\nshore. Its lawn sloped gently down to the water's edge. The house was\ngay with striped awnings, and scarlet geraniums, and chintz-covered\nchairs. The bright, sparkling, luxurious little place seemed to satisfy\na certain beauty-sense in Fenger, as did the etchings on the walls in\nhis office. Fanny had spent a week-end there in July, with three or four\nother guests, including Fascinating Facts. She had been charmed with it,\nand had announced that her energies thereafter would be directed solely\ntoward the possession of just such a house as this, with a lawn that was\nlipped by the lake, awnings and geraniums to give it a French cafe air;\nbooks and magazines enough to belie that.\n\n“And I'll always wear white,” she promised, gayly, “and there'll be\npitchers on every table, frosty on the outside, and minty on the inside,\nand you're all invited.”\n\nThey had laughed at that, and so had she, but she had been grimly in\nearnest just the same.\n\nShe shook her head now at Fenger's suggestion. “Imagine Mrs. Fenger's\nface at sight of Mizzi, and Theodore with his violin, and Otti with her\nshawls and paraphernalia. Though,” she added, seriously, “it's mighty\nkind of you, and generous--and just like a man.”\n\n“It isn't kindness nor generosity that makes me want to do things for\nyou.”\n\n“Modest,” murmured Fanny, wickedly, “as always.”\n\nFenger bent his look upon her. “Don't try the ingenue on me, Fanny.”\n\nTheodore's manager, Kurt Stein, was to have followed him in ten days.\nThe war changed that. The war was to change many things. Fanny seemed to\nsense the influx of musicians that was to burst upon the United States\nfollowing the first few weeks of the catastrophe, and she set about\nforestalling it. Advertising. That was what Theodore needed. She had\nfaith enough in his genius. But her business sense told her that this\ngenius must be enhanced by the proper setting. She set about creating\nthis setting. She overlooked no chance to fix his personality in the\nkaleidoscopic mind of the American public--or as much of it as she could\nreach. His publicity man was a dignified German-American whose methods\nwere legitimate and uninspired. Fanny's enthusiasm and superb confidence\nin Theodore's genius infected Fenger, Fascinating Facts, even Nathan\nHaynes himself. Nathan Haynes had never posed as a patron of the arts,\nin spite of his fantastic millions. But by the middle of September there\nwere few of his friends, or his wife's friends, who had not heard of\nthis Theodore Brandeis. In Chicago, Illinois, no one lives in houses, it\nis said, except the city's old families, and new millionaires. The rest\nof the vast population is flat-dwelling. To say that Nathan Haynes'\nspoken praise reached the city's house-dwellers would carry with it a\nsignificance plain to any Chicagoan.\n\nAs for Fanny's method; here is a typical example of her somewhat crude\neffectiveness in showmanship. Otti had brought with her from Vienna\nher native peasant costume. It is a costume seen daily in the Austrian\ncapital, on the Ring, in the Stadt Park, wherever Viennese nurses\nconvene with their small charges. To the American eye it is a musical\ncomedy costume, picturesque, bouffant, amazing. Your Austrian takes\nit quite for granted. Regardless of the age of the nurse, the skirt is\nshort, coming a few inches below the knees, and built like a lamp shade,\nin color usually a bright scarlet, with rows of black velvet ribbon at\nthe bottom. Beneath it are worn skirts and skirts, and skirts, so that\nthe opera-bouffe effect is complete. The bodice is black velvet, laced\nover a chemise of white. The head-gear a soaring winged affair of\nstiffly starched white, that is a pass between the Breton peasant\nwoman's cap and an aeroplane. Black stockings and slippers finish the\ncostume.\n\nOtti and Mizzi spent the glorious September days in Lincoln park,\nOtti garbed in staid American stripes and apron, Mizzi resplendent in\nsmartest of children's dresses provided for her lavishly by her aunt.\nHer fat and dimpled hands smoothed the blue, or pink or white folds with\na complacency astonishing in one of her years. “That's her mother in\nher,” Fanny thought.\n\nOne rainy autumn day Fanny entered her brother's apartment to find Otti\nresplendent in her Viennese nurse's costume. Mizzi had been cross and\nfretful, and the sight of the familiar scarlet and black and white, and\nthe great winged cap seemed to soothe her.\n\n“Otti!” Fanny exclaimed. “You gorgeous creature! What is it? A dress\nrehearsal?” Otti got the import, if not the English.\n\n“So gehen wir im Wien,” she explained, and struck a killing pose.\n\n“Everybody? All the nurses? Alle?”\n\n“Aber sure,” Otti displayed her half dozen English words whenever\npossible.\n\nFanny stared a moment. Her eyes narrowed thoughtfully. “To-morrow's\nSaturday,” she said, in German. “If it's fair and warm you put on that\ncostume and take Mizzi to the park.... Certainly the animal cages, if\nyou want to. If any one annoys you, come home. If a policeman asks you\nwhy you are dressed that way tell him it is the costume worn by nurses\nin Vienna. Give him your name. Tell him who your master is. If he\ndoesn't speak German--and he won't, in Chicago--some one will translate\nfor you.”\n\nNot a Sunday paper in Chicago that did not carry a startling picture of\nthe resplendent Otti and the dimpled and smiling Mizzi. The omnipresent\nstaff photographer seemed to sniff his victim from afar. He pounced on\nTheodore Brandeis' baby daughter, accompanied by her Viennese nurse\n(in costume) and he played her up in a Sunday special that was worth\nthousands of dollars, Fanny assured the bewildered and resentful\nTheodore, as he floundered wildly through the billowing waves of the\nSunday newspaper flood. Theodore's first appearance was to be in Chicago\nas soloist with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, in the season's opening\nprogram in October. Any music-wise Chicagoan will tell you that\nthe Chicago Symphony Orchestra is not only a musical organization\nfunctioning marvelously (when playing Beethoven). It is an institution.\nIts patrons will admit the existence, but not the superiority of\nsimilar organizations in Boston, Philadelphia and New York. On Friday\nafternoons, during the season, Orchestra Hall, situate on Michigan\nBoulevard, holds more pretty girls and fewer men than one might expect\nto see at any one gathering other than, perhaps, a wholesale debutante\ntea crush. A Friday afternoon ticket is as impossible of attainment for\none not a subscriber as a seat in heaven for a sinner. Saturday night's\naudience is staider, more masculine, less staccato. Gallery, balcony,\nparquet, it represents the city's best. Its men prefer Beethoven to\nBerlin. Its women could wear pearl necklaces, and don't. Between the\naudience and the solemn black-and-white rows on the platform there\nexists an entente cordiale. The Konzert-Meister bows to his friend in\nthe third row, as he tucks his violin under his chin. The fifth row,\naisle, smiles and nods to the sausage-fingered 'cellist.\n\n“Fritz is playing well to-night.”\n\nIn a rarefied form, it is the atmosphere that existed between audience\nand players in the days of the old and famous Daly stock company.\n\nSuch was the character of the audience Theodore was to face on his first\nappearance in America. Fanny explained its nature to him. He shrugged\nhis shoulders in a gesture as German as it was expressive.\n\nTheodore seemed to have become irrevocably German during the years of\nhis absence from America. He had a queer stock of little foreign tricks.\nHe lifted his hat to men acquaintances on the street. He had learned to\nsmack his heels smartly together and to bow stiffly from the waist,\nand to kiss the hand of the matrons--and they adored him for it. He was\nquite innocent of pose in these things. He seemed to have imbibed\nthem, together with his queer German haircut, and his incredibly German\nclothes.\n\nFanny allowed him to retain the bow, and the courtly hand-kiss, but she\ninsisted that he change the clothes and the haircut.\n\n“You'll have to let it grow, Ted. I don't mean that I want you to have a\nmane, like Ysaye. But I do think you ought to discard that convict\ncut. Besides, it isn't becoming. And if you're going to be an American\nviolinist you'll have to look it--with a foreign finish.” He let his\nhair grow. Fanny watched with interest for the appearance of the unruly\nlock which had been wont to straggle over his white forehead in\nhis schoolboy days. The new and well-cut American clothes effected\nsurprisingly little change. Fanny, surveying him, shook her head.\n\n“When you stepped off the ship you looked like a German in German\nclothes. Now you look like a German in American clothes. I don't know--I\ndo believe it's your face, Ted. I wouldn't have thought that ten years\nor so in any country could change the shape of one's nose, and mouth and\ncheekbones. Do you suppose it's the umlauts?”\n\n“Cut it out!” laughed Ted, that being his idea of modern American slang.\nHe was fascinated by these crisp phrases, but he was ten years or so\nbehind the times, and he sometimes startled his hearers by an exhibition\nof slang so old as to be almost new. It was all the more startling in\ncontrast with his conversational English, which was as carefully correct\nas a born German's.\n\nAs for the rest, it was plain that he was interested, but unhappy. He\npracticed for hours daily. He often took Mizzi to the park and came back\nstorming about the dirt, the noise, the haste, the rudeness, the crowds,\nthe mismanagement of the entire city. Dummheit, he called it. They\nprofaned the lake. They allowed the people to trample the grass. They\nthrew papers and banana skins about. And they wasted! His years in\nGermany had taught him to regard all these things as sacrilege, and the\nlast as downright criminal. He was lonesome for his Germany. That was\nplain. He hated it, and loved it, much as he hated and loved the woman\nwho had so nearly spoiled his life. The maelstrom known as the southwest\ncorner of State and Madison streets appalled him.\n\n“Gott!” he exclaimed. “Es ist unglaublich! Aber ganz unglaublich! Ich\nwerde bald veruckt.” He somehow lapsed into German when excited.\n\nFanny took him to the Haynes-Cooper plant one day, and it left\nhim dazed, and incredulous. She quoted millions at him. He was not\ninterested. He looked at the office workers, the mail-room girls, and\nshook his head, dumbly. They were using bicycles now, with a bundle rack\nin the front, in the vast stock rooms, and the roller skates had been\ndiscarded as too slow. The stock boys skimmed around corners on these\nlightweight bicycles, up one aisle, and down the next, snatching bundles\nout of bins, shooting bundles into bins, as expertly as players in a\ngymkhana.\n\nTheodore saw the uncanny rapidity with which the letter-opening machines\ndid their work. He watched the great presses that turned out the\ncatalogue--the catalogue whose message meant millions; he sat in\nFenger's office and stared at the etchings, and said, “Certainly,” with\npoliteness, when Fenger excused himself in the midst of a conversation\nto pick up the telephone receiver and talk to their shoe factory in\nMaine. He ended up finally in Fanny's office, no longer a dingy and\nundesirable corner, but a quietly brisk center that sent out vibrations\nover the entire plant. Slosson, incidentally, was no longer of the\ninfants' wear. He had been transferred to a subordinate position in the\ngrocery section.\n\n“Well,” said Fanny, seating herself at her desk, and smiling radiantly\nupon her brother. “Well, what do you think of us?”\n\nAnd then Theodore Brandeis, the careless, the selfish, the blind, said a\nmost amazing thing.\n\n“Fanny, I'll work. I'll soon get some of these millions that are lying\nabout everywhere in this country. And then I'll take you out of this. I\npromise you.”\n\nFanny stared at him, a picture of ludicrous astonishment.\n\n“Why, you talk as if you were--sorry for me!”\n\n“I am, dear. God knows I am. I'll make it up to you, somehow.”\n\nIt was the first time in all her dashing and successful career that\nFanny Brandeis had felt the sting of pity. She resented it, hotly. And\nfrom Theodore, the groper, the--“But at any rate,” something within her\nsaid, “he has always been true to himself.”\n\nTheodore's manager arrived in September, on a Holland boat, on which he\nhad been obliged to share a stuffy inside cabin with three others. Kurt\nStein was German born, but American bred, and he had the American love\nof luxurious travel. He was still testy when he reached Chicago and his\ncharge.\n\n“How goes the work?” he demanded at once, of Theodore. He eyed him\nsharply. “That's better. You have lost some of the look you had when you\nleft Wien. The ladies would have liked that look, here in America. But\nit is bad for the work.”\n\nHe took Fanny aside before he left. His face was serious. It was\nplain that he was disturbed. “That woman,” he began. “Pardon me, Mrs.\nBrandeis. She came to me. She says she is starving. She is alone there,\nin Vienna. Her--well, she is alone. The war is everywhere. They say it\nwill last for years. She wept and pleaded with me to take her here.”\n\n“No!” cried Fanny. “Don't let him hear it. He mustn't know. He----”\n\n“Yes, I know. She is a paradox, that woman. I tell you, she almost\nprevailed on me. There is something about her; something that repels\nand compels.” That struck him as being a very fine phrase indeed, and he\nrepeated it appreciatively.\n\n“I'll send her money, somehow,” said Fanny.\n\n“Yes. But they say that money is not reaching them over there. I don't\nknow what becomes of it. It vanishes.” He turned to leave. “Oh, a\nmessage for you. On my boat was Schabelitz. It looks very much as if his\ngreat fortune, the accumulation of years, would be swept away by this\nwar. Already they are tramping up and down his lands in Poland. His\nmoney--much of it--is invested in great hotels in Poland and Russia, and\nthey are using them for barracks and hospitals.”\n\n“Schabelitz! You mean a message for Theodore? From him? That's\nwonderful.”\n\n“For Theodore, and for you, too.”\n\n“For me! I made a picture of him once when I was a little girl. I didn't\nsee him again for years. Then I heard him play. It was on his last tour\nhere. I wanted to speak to him. But I was afraid. And my face was red\nwith weeping.”\n\n“He remembers you. And he means to see Theodore and you. He can do much\nfor Theodore in this country, and I think he will. His message for you\nwas this: `Tell her I still have the picture that she made of me, with\nthe jack-in-the-box in my hand, and that look on my face. Tell her I\nhave often wondered about that little girl in the red cap and the black\ncurls. I've wondered if she went on, catching that look back of people's\nfaces. If she did, she should be more famous than her brother.”'\n\n“He said that! About me!”\n\n“I am telling you as nearly as I can. He said, `Tell her it was a\nwoman who ruined Bauer's career, and caused him to end his days a music\nteacher in--in--Gott! I can't remember the name of that town----”\n\n“Winnebago.”\n\n“Winnebago. That was it. `Tell her not to let the brother spoil his life\nthat way.' So. That is the message. He said you would understand.”\n\nTheodore's face was ominous when she returned to him, after Stein had\nleft.\n\n“I wish you and Stein wouldn't stand out there in the hall whispering\nabout me as if I were an idiot patient. What were you saying?”\n\n“Nothing, Ted. Really.”\n\nHe brooded a moment. Then his face lighted up with a flash of intuition.\nHe flung an accusing finger at Fanny.\n\n“He has seen her.”\n\n“Ted! You promised.”\n\n“She's in trouble. This war. And she hasn't any money. I know. Look\nhere. We've got to send her money. Cable it.”\n\n“I will. Just leave it all to me.”\n\n“If she's here, in this country, and you're lying to me----”\n\n“She isn't. My word of honor, Ted.”\n\nHe relaxed.\n\nLife was a very complicated thing for Fanny these days. Ted was\nleaning on her; Mizzi, Otti, and now Fenger. Nathan Haynes was poking a\ndisturbing finger into that delicate and complicated mechanism of\nSystem which Fenger had built up in the Haynes-Cooper plant. And Fenger,\nsnarling, was trying to guard his treasure. He came to Fanny with his\ngrievance. Fanny had always stimulated him, reassured him, given him the\nmental readjustment that he needed.\n\nHe strode into her office one morning in late September. Ordinarily he\nsent for her. He stood by her desk now, a sheaf of papers in his hand,\npalpably stage props, and lifted significant eyebrows in the direction\nof the stenographer busy at her typewriter in the corner.\n\n“You may leave that, Miss Mahin,” Fanny said. Miss Mahin, a\ncomprehending young woman, left it, and the room as well. Fenger sat\ndown. He was under great excitement, though he was quite controlled.\nFanny, knowing him, waited quietly. His eyes held hers.\n\n“It's come,” Fenger began. “You know that for the last year Haynes has\nbeen milling around with a herd of sociologists, philanthropists, and\nstudents of economics. He had some scheme in the back of his head, but I\nthought it was just another of his impractical ideas. It appears that\nit wasn't. Between the lot of them they've evolved a savings and\nprofit-sharing plan that's founded on a kind of practical universal\nbrotherhood dream. Haynes's millions are bothering him. If they actually\nput this thing through I'll get out. It'll mean that everything I've\nbuilt up will be torn down. It will mean that any six-dollar-a-week\ngirl----”\n\n“As I understand it,” interrupted Fanny, “it will mean that there will\nbe no more six-dollar-a-week girls.”\n\n“That's it. And let me tell you, once you get the ignorant, unskilled\ntype to believing they're actually capable of earning decent money,\nactually worth something, they're worse than useless. They're\ndangerous.”\n\n“You don't believe that.”\n\n“I do.”\n\n“But it's a theory that belongs to the Dark Ages. We've disproved it.\nWe've got beyond that.”\n\n“Yes. So was war. We'd got beyond it. But it's here. I tell you, there\nare only two classes: the governing and the governed. That has always\nbeen true. It always will be. Let the Socialists rave. It has never got\nthem anywhere. I know. I come from the mucker class myself. I know what\nthey stand for. Boost them, and they'll turn on you. If there's anything\nin any of them, he'll pull himself up by his own bootstraps.”\n\n“They're not all potential Fengers.”\n\n“Then let 'em stay what they are.”\n\nFanny's pencil was tracing and retracing a tortured and meaningless\nfigure on the paper before her. “Tell me, do you remember a girl named\nSarah Sapinsky?”\n\n“Never heard of her.”\n\n“That's fitting. Sarah Sapinsky was a very pretty, very dissatisfied\ngirl who was a slave to the bundle chute. One day there was a period\nof two seconds when a bundle didn't pop out at her, and she had time to\nthink. Anyway, she left. I asked about her. She's on the streets.”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“Thanks to you and your system.”\n\n“Look here, Fanny. I didn't come to you for that kind of talk. Don't,\nfor heaven's sake, give me any sociological drivel to-day. I'm not here\njust to tell you my troubles. You know what my contract is here with\nHaynes-Cooper. And you know the amount of stock I hold. If this scheme\nof Haynes's goes in, I go out. Voluntarily. But at my own price. The\nHaynes-Cooper plant is at the height of its efficiency now.” He dropped\nhis voice. “But the mail order business is in its infancy. There's no\nlimit to what can be done with it in the next few years. Understand?\nDo you get what I'm trying to tell you?” He leaned forward, tense and\nterribly in earnest.\n\nFanny stared at him. Then her hand went to her head in a gesture of\nweariness. “Not to-day. Please. And not here. Don't think I'm ungrateful\nfor your confidence. But--this month has been a terrific strain.\nJust let me pass the fifteenth of October. Let me see Theodore on the\nway----”\n\nFenger's fingers closed about her wrist. Fanny got to her feet angrily.\nThey glared at each other a moment. Then the humor of the picture they\nmust be making struck Fanny. She began to laugh. Fenger's glare became a\nfrown. He turned abruptly and left the office. Fanny looked down at her\nwrist ruefully. Four circlets of red marked its smooth whiteness. She\nlaughed again, a little uncertainly this time.\n\nWhen she got home that night she found, in her mail, a letter for\nTheodore, postmarked Vienna, and stamped with the mark of the censor.\nTheodore had given her his word of honor that he would not write Olga,\nor give her his address. Olga was risking Fanny's address. She stood\nlooking at the letter now. Theodore was coming in for dinner, as he did\nfive nights out of the week. As she stood in the hallway, she heard\nthe rattle of his key in the lock. She flew down the hall and into her\nbedroom, her letters in her hand. She opened her dressing table drawer\nand threw them into it, switched on the light and turned to face\nTheodore in the doorway.\n\n“'Lo, Sis.”\n\n“Hello, Teddy. Kiss me. Phew! That pipe again. How'd the work go\nto-day?”\n\n“So--so. Any mail for me?”\n\n“No.”\n\nThat night, when he had gone, she took out the letter and stood turning\nit over and over in her hands. She had no thought of reading it. It was\nits destruction she was contemplating. Finally she tucked it away in her\nhandkerchief box. Perhaps, after the fifteenth of October. Everything\ndepended on that.\n\nAnd the fifteenth of October came. It had dragged for weeks, and then,\nat the end, it galloped. By that time Fanny had got used to seeing\nTheodore's picture and name outside Orchestra Hall, and in the musical\ncolumns of the papers. Brandeis. Theodore Brandeis, the violinist. The\nname sang in her ears. When she walked on Michigan Avenue during that\nlast week she would force herself to march straight on past Orchestra\nHall, contenting herself with a furtive and oblique glance at the\nannouncement board. The advance programs hung, a little bundle of them,\nsuspended by a string from a nail on the wall near the box office, so\nthat ticket purchasers might rip one off and peruse the week's musical\nmenu. Fanny longed to hear the comment of the little groups that were\nconstantly forming and dispersing about the box office window. She never\ndreamed of allowing herself to hover near it. She thought sometimes of\nthe woman in the businesslike gray skirt and the black sateen apron who\nhad drudged so cheerfully in the little shop so that Theodore Brandeis'\nname might shine now from the very top of the program, in heavy black\nletters:\n\nSoloist: MR. THEODORE BRANDEIS, Violin\n\nThe injustice of it. Fanny had never ceased to rage at that.\n\nIn the years to come Theodore Brandeis was to have that adulation which\nthe American public, temperamentally so cold, gives its favorite, once\nthe ice of its reserve is thawed. He was to look down on that surging,\ntempestuous crowd which sometimes packs itself about the foot of the\nplatform in Carnegie Hall, demanding more, more, more, after a generous\nconcert is concluded. He had to learn to protect himself from those\nhysterical, enraptured, wholly feminine adorers who swarmed about him,\nscaling the platform itself. But of all this there was nothing on that\nFriday and Saturday in October. Orchestra Hall audiences are not, as\na rule, wildly demonstrative. They were no exception. They listened\nattentively, appreciatively. They talked, critically and favorably, on\nthe way home. They applauded generously. They behaved as an Orchestra\nHall audience always behaves, and would behave, even if it were\nconfronted with a composite Elman-Kreisler-Ysaye soloist. Theodore's\nplaying was, as a whole, perhaps the worst of his career. Not that he\ndid not rise to magnificent heights at times. But it was what is known\nas uneven playing. He was torn emotionally, nervously, mentally. His\nplaying showed it.\n\nFanny, seated in the auditorium, her hands clasped tight, her heart\nhammering, had a sense of unreality as she waited for Theodore to appear\nfrom the little door at the left. He was to play after the intermission.\nFanny had arrived late, with Theodore, that Friday afternoon. She felt\nshe could not sit through the first part of the program. They waited\ntogether in the anteroom. Theodore, looking very slim and boyish in his\nfrock coat, walked up and down, up and down. Fanny wanted to straighten\nhis tie. She wanted to pick an imaginary thread off his lapel. She\nwanted to adjust the white flower in his buttonhole (he jerked it out\npresently, because it interfered with his violin, he said). She wanted\nto do any one of the foolish, futile things that would have served to\nrelieve her own surcharged feelings. But she had learned control in\nthese years. And she yielded to none of them.\n\nThe things they said and did were, perhaps, almost ludicrous.\n\n“How do I look?” Theodore demanded, and stood up before her.\n\n“Beautiful!” said Fanny, and meant it.\n\nTheodore passed a hand over his cheek. “Cut myself shaving, damn it!”\n\n“It doesn't show.”\n\nHe resumed his pacing. Now and then he stopped, and rubbed his hands\ntogether with a motion we use in washing. Finally:\n\n“I wish you'd go out front,” he said, almost pettishly. Fanny rose,\nwithout a word. She looked very handsome. Excitement had given her\ncolor. The pupils of her eyes were dilated and they shone brilliantly.\nShe looked at her brother. He stared at her. They swayed together. They\nkissed, and clung together for a long moment. Then Fanny turned and\nwalked swiftly away, and stumbled a little as she groped for the\nstairway.\n\nThe bell in the foyer rang. The audience strolled to the auditorium.\nThey lagged, Fanny thought. They crawled. She told herself that she must\nnot allow her nerves to tease her like that. She looked about her, with\noutward calm. Her eyes met Fenger's. He was seated, alone. It was he\nwho had got a subscription seat for her from a friend. She had said she\npreferred to be alone. She looked at him now and he at her, and they did\nnot nod nor smile. The house settled itself flutteringly.\n\nA man behind Fanny spoke. “Who's this Brandeis?”\n\n“I don't know. A new one. German, I guess. They say he's good.\nKreisler's the boy who can play for me, though.”\n\nThe orchestra was seated now. Stock, the conductor, came out from\nthe little side door. Behind him walked Theodore. There was a little,\nimpersonal burst of applause. Stock mounted his conductor's platform and\nglanced paternally down at Theodore, who stood at the left, violin and\nbow in hand, bowing. The audience seemed to warm to his boyishness.\nThey applauded again, and he bowed in a little series of jerky bobs that\nwaggled his coat-tails. Heels close together, knees close together. A\nGerman bow. And then a polite series of bobs addressed to Stock and his\norchestra. Stock's long, slim hands poised in air. His fingertips seemed\nto draw from the men before him the first poignant strains of Theodore's\nconcerto. Theodore stood, slim and straight. Fanny's face, lifted toward\nhim, was a prayerful thing. Theodore suddenly jerked back the left lapel\nof his coat in a little movement Fanny remembered as typical in his\nboyish days, nuzzled his violin tenderly, and began to play.\n\nIt is the most excruciating of instruments, the violin, or the most\nexquisite. I think Fanny actually heard very little of his playing. Her\nhands were icy. Her cheeks were hot. The man before her was not Theodore\nBrandeis, the violinist, but Teddy, the bright-haired, knickered\nschoolboy who played to those people seated in the yellow wooden pews of\nthe temple in Winnebago. The years seemed to fade away. He crouched over\nhis violin to get the 'cello tones for which he was to become famous,\nand it was the same hunched, almost awkward pose that the boy had used.\nFanny found herself watching his feet as his shifted his position. He\nwas nervous. And he was not taken out of himself. She knew that because\nshe saw the play of his muscles about the jaw-bone. It followed that he\nwas not playing his best. She could not tell that from listening to him.\nHer music sense was dulled. She got it from these outward signs. The\nwoman next to her was reading a program absorbedly, turning the pages\nregularly, and with care. Fanny could have killed her with her two\nhands. She tried to listen detachedly. The music was familiar to her.\nTheodore had played it for her, again and again. The last movement\nhad never failed to shake her emotionally. It was the glorious and\ntriumphant cry of a people tried and unafraid. She heard it now,\nunmoved.\n\nAnd then Theodore was bowing his little jerky bows, and he was shaking\nhands with Stock, and with the First Violin. He was gone. Fanny sat with\nher hands in her lap. The applause continued. Theodore appeared again.\nBowed. He bent very low now, with his arms hanging straight. There was\nsomething gracious and courtly about him. And foreign. He must keep\nthat, Fanny thought. They like it. She saw him off again. More applause.\nEncores were against the house rules. She knew that. Then it meant they\nwere pleased. He was to play again. A group of Hungarian dances this\ntime. They were wild, gypsy things, rising to frenzy at times. He played\nthem with spirit and poetry. To listen sent the blood singing through\nthe veins. Fanny found herself thinking clearly and exaltedly.\n\n“This is what my mother drudged for, and died for, and it was worth it.\nAnd you must do the same, if necessary. Nothing else matters. What he\nneeds now is luxury. He's worn out with fighting. Ease. Peace. Leisure.\nYou've got to give them to him. It's no use, Fanny. You lose.”\n\nIn that moment she reached a mark in her spiritual career that she was\nto outdistance but once.\n\nTheodore was bowing again. Fanny had scarcely realized that he had\nfinished. The concert was over.\n\n“... the group of dances,” the man behind her was saying as he helped\nthe girl next him with her coat, “but I didn't like that first thing.\nChurch music, not concert.”\n\nFanny found her way back to the ante-room. Theodore was talking to the\nconductor, and one or two others. He looked tired, and his eyes found\nFanny's with appeal and relief in them. She came over to him. There were\nintroductions, congratulations. Fanny slipped her hand over his with a\nfirm pressure.\n\n“Come, dear. You must be tired.”\n\nAt the door they found Fenger waiting. Theodore received his well-worded\ncongratulations with an ill-concealed scowl.\n\n“My car's waiting,” said Fenger. “Won't you let me take you home?”\n\nA warning pressure from Theodore. “Thanks, no. We have a car. Theodore's\nvery tired.”\n\n“I can quite believe that.”\n\n“Not tired,” growled Theodore, like a great boy. “I'm hungry. Starved. I\nnever eat before playing.”\n\nKurt Stein, Theodore's manager, had been hovering over him solicitously.\n“You must remember to-morrow night. I should advise you to rest now, as\nquickly as possible.” He, too, glared at Fenger.\n\nFenger fell back, almost humbly. “I've great news for you. I must see\nyou Sunday. After this is over. I'll telephone you. Don't try to come to\nwork to-morrow.” All this is a hurried aside to Fanny.\n\nFanny nodded and moved away with Theodore.\n\nTheodore leaned back in the car, but there was no hint of relaxation. He\nwas as tense and vibrant as one of his own violin strings.\n\n“It went, didn't it? They're like clods, these American audiences.”\n It was on the tip of Fanny's tongue to say that he had professed\nindifference to audiences, but she wisely refrained. “Gad! I'm hungry.\nWhat makes this Fenger hang around so? I'm going to tell him to keep\naway, some day. The way he stares at you. Let's go somewhere to-night,\nFan. Or have some people in. I can't sit about after I've played. Olga\nalways used to have a supper party, or something.”\n\n“All right, Ted. Would you like the theater?”\n\nFor the first time in her life she felt a little whisper of sympathy for\nthe despised Olga. Perhaps, after all, she had not been wholly to blame.\n\nHe was to leave Sunday morning for Cleveland, where he would play\nMonday. He had insisted on taking Mizzi with him, though Fanny had\nrailed and stormed. Theodore had had his way.\n\n“She's used to it. She likes to travel, don't you, Mizzi? You should\nhave seen her in Russia, and all over Germany, and in Sweden. She's a\nbetter traveler than her dad.”\n\nSaturday morning's papers were kind, but cool. They used words such as\npromising, uneven, overambitious, gifted. Theodore crumpled the lot\ninto a ball and hurled them across the room, swearing horribly. Then he\nsmoothed them out, clipped them, and saved them carefully. His playing\nthat night was tinged with bravado, and the Saturday evening audience\nrose to it. There was about his performance a glow, a spirit that had\nbeen lacking on the previous day.\n\nInconsistently enough, he missed the antagonism of the European critics.\nHe was puzzled and resentful.\n\n“They hardly say a word about the meaning of the concerto. They accept\nit as a piece of music, Jewish in theme. It might as well be entitled\nSpringtime.”\n\n“This isn't France or Russia,” said Fanny. “Antagonism here isn't\nreligious. It's personal, almost. You've been away so many years you've\nforgotten. They don't object to us as a sect, or a race, but as a type.\nThat's the trouble, Clarence Heyl says. We're free to build as many\nsynagogues as we like, and worship in them all day, if we want to. But\nwe don't want to. The struggle isn't racial any more, but individual.\nFor some reason or other one flashy, loud-talking Hebrew in a restaurant\ncan cause more ill feeling than ten thousand of them holding a religious\nmass meeting in Union Square.”\n\nTheodore pondered a moment. “Then here each one of us is responsible. Is\nthat it?”\n\n“I suppose so.”\n\n“But look here. I've been here ten weeks, and I've met your friends, and\nnot one of them is a Jew. How's that?”\n\nFanny flushed a little. “Oh, it just worked out that way.”\n\nTheodore looked at her hard. “You mean you worked it out that way?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Fan, we're a couple of weaklings, both of us, to have sprung from\na mother like ours. I don't know which is worse; my selfishness,\nor yours.” Then, at the hurt that showed in her face, he was all\ncontrition. “Forgive me, Sis. You've been so wonderful to me, and to\nMizzi, and to all of us. I'm a good-for-nothing fiddler, that's all.\nYou're the strong one.”\n\nFenger had telephoned her on Saturday. He and his wife were at their\nplace in the country. Fanny was to take the train out there Sunday\nmorning. She looked forward to it with a certain relief. The weather had\nturned unseasonably warm, as Chicago Octobers sometimes do. Up to the\nlast moment she had tried to shake Theodore's determination to take\nMizzi and Otti with him. But he was stubborn.\n\n“I've got to have her,” he said.\n\nMichael Fenger's voice over the telephone had been as vibrant with\nsuppressed excitement as Michael Fenger's dry, hard tones could be.\n\n“Fanny, it's done--finished,” he said. “We had a meeting to-day. This is\nmy last month with Haynes-Cooper.”\n\n“But you can't mean it. Why, you ARE Haynes-Cooper. How can they let you\ngo?”\n\n“I can't tell you now. We'll go over it all to-morrow. I've new plans.\nThey've bought me out. D'you see? At a price that--well, I thought I'd\ngot used to juggling millions at Haynes-Cooper. But this surprised even\nme. Will you come? Early? Take the eight-ten.”\n\n“That's too early. I'll get the ten.”\n\nThe mid-October country was a lovely thing. Fanny, with the strain of\nTheodore's debut and leave-taking behind her, and the prospect of a\nhigh-tension business talk with Fenger ahead, drank in the beauty of the\nwayside woods gratefully.\n\nFenger met her at the station. She had never seen him so boyish, so\nexuberant. He almost pranced.\n\n“Hop in,” he said. He had driven down in a runabout. “Brother get off\nall right? Gad! He CAN play. And you've made the whole thing possible.”\n He turned to look at her. “You're a wonder.”\n\n“In your present frame of mind and state of being,” laughed Fanny,\n“you'd consider any one a wonder. You're so pleased with yourself you're\nfairly gummy.”\n\nFenger laughed softly and sped the car on. They turned in at the gate.\nThere was scarlet salvia, now, to take the place of the red geraniums.\nThe gay awnings, too, were gone.\n\n“This is our last week,” Fenger explained. “It's too cold out here for\nKatherine. We're moving into town to-morrow. We're more or less camping\nout here, with only the Jap to take care of us.”\n\n“Don't apologize, please. I'm grateful just to be here, after the week\nI've had. Let's have the news now.”\n\n“We'll have lunch first. I'm afraid you'll have to excuse Katherine. She\nprobably won't be down for lunch.” The Jap had spread the luncheon table\non the veranda, but a brisk lake breeze had sprung up, and he was busy\nnow transferring his table from the porch to the dining room. “Would you\nhave believed it,” said Fenger, “when you left town? Good old lake. Mrs.\nFenger coming down?” to the man.\n\nThe Jap shook his head. “Nossa.”\n\nTheir talk at luncheon was all about Theodore and his future. Fenger\nsaid that what Theodore needed was a firm and guiding hand. “A sort of\ncombination manager and slave-driver. An ambitious and intelligent wife\nwould do it. That's what we all need. A woman to work for, and to make\nus work.”\n\nFanny smiled. “Mizzi will have to be woman enough, I'm afraid. Poor\nTed.”\n\nThey rose. “Now for the talk,” said Fenger. But the telephone had\nsounded shrilly a moment before, and the omnipresent little Jap summoned\nFenger. He was back in a minute, frowning. “It's Haynes. I'm sorry. I'm\nafraid it'll take a half hour of telephoning. Don't you want to take a\ncat-nap? Or a stroll down to the lake?”\n\n“Don't bother about me. I'll probably take a run outdoors.”\n\n“Be back in half an hour.”\n\nBut when she returned he was still at the telephone. She got a book and\nstretched luxuriously among the cushions of one of the great lounging\nchairs, and fell asleep. When she awoke Fenger was seated opposite her.\nHe was not reading. He was not smoking. He evidently had been sitting\nthere, looking at her.\n\n“Oh, gracious! Mouth open?”\n\n“No.”\n\nFanny fought down an impulse to look as cross as she felt. “What time?\nWhy didn't you wake me?” The house was very quiet. She patted her hair\ndeftly, straightened her collar. “Where's everybody? Isn't Mrs. Fenger\ndown yet?”\n\n“No. Don't you want to hear about my plans now?”\n\n“Of course I do. That's what I came for. I don't see why you didn't tell\nme hours ago. You're as slow in action as a Chinese play. Out with it.”\n\nFenger got up and began to pace the floor, not excitedly, but with an\nair of repression. He looked very powerful and compelling, there in the\nlow-ceilinged, luxurious room. “I'll make it brief. We met yesterday in\nHaynes's office. Of course we had discussed the thing before. You know\nthat. Haynes knew that I'd never run the plant under the new conditions.\nWhy, it would kill every efficiency rule I've ever made. Here I had\ntrimmed that enormous plant down to fighting weight. There wasn't a\nuseless inch or ounce about the whole enormous billionaire bulk of it.\nAnd then to have Haynes come along, with his burdensome notions, and\nhis socialistic slop. They'd cripple any business, no matter how great\na start it had. I told him all that. We didn't waste much time on\nargument, though. We knew we'd never get together. In half an hour we\nwere talking terms. You know my contract and the amount of stock I hold.\nWell, we threshed that out, and Haynes is settling for two million and a\nhalf.”\n\nHe came to a stop before Fanny's chair.\n\n“Two million and a half what?” asked Fanny, feebly.\n\n“Dollars.” He smiled rather grimly. “In a check.”\n\n“One--check?” “One check.”\n\nFanny digested that in her orderly mind. “I thought I was used to\nthinking in millions. But this--I'd like to touch the check, just once.”\n\n“You shall.” He drew up a chair near her. “Now get this, Fanny. There's\nnothing that you and I can't do with two millions and a half. Nothing.\nWe know this mail order game as no two people in the world know it. And\nit's in its infancy. I know the technical side of it. You know the\nhuman side of it. I tell you that in five years' time you and I can be\na national power. Not merely the heads of a prosperous mail order\nbusiness, but figures in finance. See what's happened to Haynes-Cooper\nin the last five years! Why, it's incredible. It's grotesque. And it's\nnothing to what you and I can do, working together. You know people,\nsomehow. You've a genius for sensing their wants, or feelings, or\nemotions--I don't know just what it is. And I know facts. And we have\ntwo million and a half--I can make it nearly three millions--to start\nwith. Haynes, fifteen years ago, had a couple of hundred thousand. In\nfive years we can make the Haynes-Cooper organization look as modern and\ncompetent as a cross-roads store. This isn't a dream. These are facts.\nYou know how my mind works. Like a cold chisel. I can see this whole\ncountry--and Europe, too, after the war--God, yes!--stretched out before\nus like a patient before expert surgeons. You to attend to its heart,\nand I to its bones and ligaments. I can put you where no other woman\nhas ever been. I've a hundred new plans this minute, and a hundred\nmore waiting to be born. So have you. I tell you it's just a matter of\nbuildings. Of bricks and stone, and machinery and people to make the\nmachinery go. Once we get those--and it's only a matter of months--we\ncan accomplish things I daren't even dream of. What was Haynes-Cooper\nfifteen years ago? What was the North American Cloak and Suit Company?\nThe Peter Johnston Stores, of New York? Wells-Kayser? Nothing. They\ndidn't exist. And this year Haynes-Cooper is declaring a twenty-five per\ncent dividend. Do you get what that means? But of course you do. That's\nthe wonder of it. I never need explain things to you. You've a genius\nfor understanding.”\n\nFanny had been sitting back in her chair, crouching almost, her\neyes fixed upon the man's face, so terrible in its earnestness and\nindomitable strength. When he stopped talking now, and stood looking\ndown at her, she rose, too, her eyes still on his face. She was twisting\nthe fingers of one hand in the fingers of the other, in a frightened\nsort of way.\n\n“I'm not really a business woman. I--wait a minute, please--I have a\nknack of knowing what people are thinking and wanting. But that isn't\nbusiness.” “It isn't, eh? It's the finest kind of business sense. It's\nthe thing the bugs call psychology, and it's as necessary to-day as\ncapital was yesterday. You can get along without the last. You can't\nwithout the first. One can be acquired. The other you've got to be born\nwith.”\n\n“But I--you know, of late, it's only the human side of it that has\nappealed to me. I don't know why. I seem to have lost interest in the\nactual mechanics of it.”\n\nFenger stood looking at her, his head lowered. A scarlet stripe, that\nshe had never noticed before, seemed to stand out suddenly, like a\nwelt, on his forehead. Then he came toward her. She raised her hand in\na little futile gesture. She took an involuntary step backward,\nencountered the chair she had just left, and sank into it coweringly.\nShe sat there, looking up at him, fascinated. His hand, on the wing of\nthe great chair, was shaking. So, too, was his voice.\n\n“Fanny, Katherine's not here.”\n\nFanny still looked up at him, wordlessly.\n\n“Katherine left here yesterday. She's in town.” Then, at the look in\nher face, “She was here when I telephoned you yesterday. Late yesterday\nafternoon she had one of her fantastic notions. She insisted that she\nmust go into town. It was too cold for her here. Too damp. Too--well,\nshe went. And I let her go. And I didn't telephone you again. I wanted\nyou to come.”\n\nFanny Brandeis, knowing him, must have felt a great qualm of terror\nand helplessness. But she was angry, too, a wholesome ingredient in a\nsituation such as this. The thing she said and did now was inspired. She\nlaughed--a little uncertainly, it is true--but still she laughed. And\nshe said, in a matter-of-fact tone:\n\n“Well, I must say that's a rather shabby trick. Still, I suppose the\ntired business man has got to have his little melodrama. What do I do?\nH'm? Beat my breast and howl? Or pound on the door panel?”\n\nFenger stood looking at her. “Don't laugh at me, Fanny.”\n\nShe stood up, still smiling. It was rather a brilliant piece of work.\nFenger, taken out of himself though he was, still was artist enough to\nappreciate it.\n\n“Why not laugh,” she said, “if I'm amused? And I am. Come now, Mr.\nFenger. Be serious. And let's get back to the billions. I want to catch\nthe five-fifteen.”\n\n“I AM serious.” “Well, if you expect me to play the hunted heroine,\nI'm sorry.” She pointed an accusing finger at him. “I know now. You're\nquitting Haynes-Cooper for the movies. And this is a rehearsal for a\nvampire film.”\n\n“You nervy little devil, you!” He reached out with one great,\nirresistible hand and gripped her shoulder. “You wonderful, glorious\ngirl!” The hand that gripped her shoulder swung her to him. She saw his\nface with veins she had never noticed before standing out, in knots,\non his temples, and his eyes were fixed and queer. And he was talking,\nrather incoherently, and rapidly. He was saying the same thing over and\nover again: “I'm crazy about you. I've been looking for a woman like\nyou--all my life. I'm crazy about you. I'm crazy----”\n\nAnd then Fanny's fine composure and self control fled, and she thought\nof her mother. She began to struggle, too, and to say, like any other\ngirl, “Let me go! Let me go! You're hurting me. Let me go! You! You!”\n\nAnd then, quite clearly, from that part of her brain where it had been\ntucked away until she should need it, came Clarence Heyl's whimsical bit\nof advice. Her mind released it now, complete.\n\n“If you double your fist this way, and tuck your thumb alongside, like\nthat, and aim for this spot right here, about two inches this side of\nthe chin, bringing your arm back and up quickly, like a piston, the\nperson you hit will go down, limp. There's a nerve right here that\ncommunicates with the brain. The blow makes you see stars, and bright\nlights----”\n\nShe went limp in his arms. She shut her eyes, flutteringly. “All\nmen--like you--have a yellow streak,” she whispered, and opened her\neyes, and looked up at him, smiling a little. He relaxed his hold, in\nsurprise and relief. And with her eyes on that spot barely two inches\nto the side of the chin she brought her right arm down, slowly, slowly,\nfist doubled, and then up like a piston--snap! His teeth came together\nwith a sharp little crack. His face, in that second, was a comic mask,\nsurprised, stunned, almost idiotic. Then he went down, as Clarence Heyl\nhad predicted, limp. Not with a crash, but slowly, crumpingly, so that\nhe almost dragged her with him.\n\nFanny stood looking down at him a moment. Then she wiped her mouth with\nthe back of her hand. She walked out of the room, and down the hall. She\nsaw the little Jap dart suddenly back from a doorway, and she stamped\nher foot and said, “S-s-cat!” as if he had been a rat. She gathered up\nher hat and bag from the hall table, and so, out of the door, and down\nthe walk, to the road. And then she began to run. She ran, and ran, and\nran. It was a longish stretch to the pretty, vine-covered station. She\nseemed unconscious of fatigue, or distance. She must have been at least\na half hour on the way. When she reached the station the ticket agent\ntold her there was no train until six. So she waited, quietly. She put\non her hat (she had carried it in her hand all the way) and patted her\nhair into place. When the train came she found a seat quite alone, and\nsank into its corner, and rested her head against her open palm. It was\nnot until then that she felt a stab of pain. She looked at her hand, and\nsaw that the skin of her knuckles was bruised and bleeding.\n\n“Well, if this,” she said to herself, “isn't the most idiotic thing that\never happened to a woman outside a near-novel.”\n\nShe looked at her knuckles, critically, as though the hand belonged to\nsome one else. Then she smiled. And even as she smiled a great lump came\ninto her throat, and the bruise blurred before her eyes, and she was\ncrying rackingly, relievedly, huddled there in her red plush corner.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n\nIt was eight o'clock when she let herself into her apartment. She had\ngiven the maid a whole holiday. When Fanny had turned on the light in\nher little hallway she stood there a moment, against the door, her hand\nspread flat against the panel. It was almost as though she patted it,\nlovingly, gratefully. Then she went on into the living room, and stood\nlooking at its rosy lamplight. Then, still as though seeing it all for\nthe first time, into her own quiet, cleanly bedroom, with its cream\nenamel, and the chaise longue that she had had cushioned in rose because\nit contrasted so becomingly with her black hair. And there, on her\ndressing table, propped up against the brushes and bottles, was the\nyellow oblong of a telegram. From Theodore of course. She opened it with\na rush of happiness. It was like a loving hand held out to her in need.\nIt was a day letter.\n\n“We sail Monday on the St. Paul. Mizzi is with me. I broke my word to\nyou. But you lied to me about the letters. I found them the week\nbefore the concert. I shall bring her back with me or stay to fight for\nGermany. Forgive me, dear sister.”\n\n\nJust fifty words. His thrifty German training.\n\n“No!” cried Fanny, aloud. “No! No!” And the cry quavered and died away,\nand another took its place, and it, too, gave way to another, so that\nshe was moaning as she stood there with the telegram in her shaking\nhand. She read it again, her lips moving, as old people sometimes read.\nThen she began to whimper, with her closed fist over her mouth, her\nwhole body shaking. All her fine courage gone now; all her rigid\nself-discipline; all her iron determination. She was not a tearful\nwoman. And she had wept much on the train. So the thing that\nwrenched and shook her now was all the more horrible because of its\nsoundlessness. She walked up and down the room, pushing her hair back\nfrom her forehead with the flat of her hand. From time to time she\nsmoothed out the crumpled yellow slip of paper and read it again. Her\nmind, if you could have seen into it, would have presented a confused\nand motley picture. Something like this: But his concert engagements?...\nThat was what had happened to Bauer.... How silly he had looked when her\nfist met his jaw.... It had turned cold; why didn't they have steam on?\nThe middle of October.... Teddy, how could you do it! How could you\ndo it!... Was he still lying in a heap on the floor? But of course the\nsneaking little Jap had found him.... Somebody to talk to. That was what\nshe wanted. Some one to talk to....\n\nSome one to talk to. She stood there, in the middle of her lamp-lighted\nliving room, and she held out her hands in silent appeal. Some one to\ntalk to. In her mind she went over the list of those whose lives had\ntouched hers in the last few crowded years. Fenger, Fascinating Facts,\nElla Monahan, Nathan Haynes; all the gay, careless men and women she had\nmet from time to time through Fenger and Fascinating Facts. Not one of\nthem could she turn to now.\n\nClarence Heyl. She breathed a sigh of relief. Clarence Heyl. He had\nhelped her once, to-day. And now, for the second time, something that\nhe had said long before came from its hiding place in her subconscious\nmind. She had said:\n\n“Some days I feel I've got to walk out of the office, and down the\nstreet, without a hat, and on and on, walking and walking, and running\nand running till I come to the horizon.”\n\nAnd Heyl had answered, in his quiet, reassuring way: “Some day that\nfeeling will get too strong for you. When that time comes get on a train\nmarked Denver. From there take another to Estes Park. That's the Rocky\nMountains, where the horizon lives and has its being. Ask for Heyl's\nplace. They'll hand you from one to the other. I may be there, but more\nlikely I shan't. The key's in the mail box, tied to a string. You'll\nfind a fire laid with fat pine knots. My books are there. The bedding's\nin the cedar chest. And the mountains will make you clean and whole\nagain; and the pines...”\n\nFanny went to the telephone. Trains for Denver. She found the road she\nwanted, and asked for information. She was on her own ground here. All\nher life she had had to find her own trains, check her own trunks, plan\nher journeys. Sometimes she had envied the cotton-wool women who had had\nall these things done for them, always.\n\nOne-half of her mind was working clearly and coolly. The other half was\nnumb. There were things to be done. They would take a day. More than\na day, but she would neglect most of them. She must notify the office.\nThere were tickets to be got. Reservations. Money at the bank. Packing.\nWhen the maid came in at eleven Fanny had suitcases and bags out, and\nher bedroom was strewn with shoes, skirts, coats.\n\nLate Monday afternoon Fenger telephoned. She did not answer. There came\na note from him, then a telegram. She did not read them. Tuesday found\nher on a train bound for Colorado. She remembered little of the first\nhalf of her journey. She had brought with her books and magazines, and\nshe must have read hem, but her mind had evidently retained nothing of\nwhat she had read. She must have spent hours looking out of the window,\nfor she remembered, long afterward, the endlessness and the monotony of\nthe Kansas prairies. They soothed her. She was glad there were no bits\nof autumnal woodland, no tantalizing vistas, nothing to break the flat\nand boundless immensity of it. Here was something big, and bountiful,\nand real, and primal. Good Kansas dirt. Miles of it. Miles of it. She\nfelt she would like to get out and tramp on it, hard.\n\n“Pretty cold up there in Estes Park,” the conductor had said. “Been\nsnowing up in the mountains.”\n\nShe had arranged to stop in Denver only long enough to change trains.\nA puffy little branch line was to take her from Denver to Loveland, and\nthere, she had been told, one of the big mountain-road steam automobiles\nwould take her up the mountains to her destination. For one as mentally\nalert as she normally was, the exact location of that destination was\nvery hazy in her mind. Heyl's place. That was all. Ordinarily she would\nhave found the thought ridiculous. But she concentrated on it now; clung\nto it.\n\nAt the first glimpse of the foot-hills Fanny's listless gaze became\ninterested. If you have ever traveled on the jerky, cleanly, meandering\nlittle road that runs between Denver and the Park you know that it\nwinds, and curves, so that the mountains seem to leap about, friskily,\nfirst confronting you on one side of the car window, then disappearing\nand seeming to taunt you from the windows of the opposite side. Fanny\nlaughed aloud. The mountain steam-car was waiting at Loveland. There\nwere few passengers at this time of year. The driver was a great tanned\ngiant, pongee colored from his hair to his puttees and boots. Fanny was\nto learn, later, that in Estes Park the male tourist was likely to\nbe puny, pallid, and unattractive when compared to the tall, slim,\nstraight, khaki-clad youth, browned by the sun, and the wind, and the\ndust, who drives his steamer up and down the perilous mountain roads\nwith more dexterity than the charioteering gods ever displayed on\nOlympus.\n\nFanny got the seat beside this glorious person. The steamer was a huge\nvehicle, boasting five rows of seats, and looking very much like a small\nedition of the sightseeing cars one finds in tourist-infested cities.\n\n“Heyl's place,” said Fanny. Suppose it failed to work!\n\nSaid the blond god, “Stopping at the Inn overnight, I s'pose.”\n\n“Why--I don't know,” faltered Fanny. “Can't I go right on to--to--Heyl's\nplace?”\n\n“Can.” Mountain steamer men are not loquacious. “Sure. Better not. You\nwon't get to the Inn till dark. Better stay there over night, and go on\nup to Heyl's place in the morning.”\n\nThen he leaned forward, clawed about expertly among what appeared to\nFanny's eyes to be a maze of handles, brakes, valves; and the great car\nglided smoothly off, without a bump, without a jar. Fanny took a long\nbreath.\n\nThere is no describing a mountain. One uses words, and they are futile.\nAnd the Colorado Rockies, in October, when the aspens are turning! Well,\naspens turn gold in October. People who have seen an aspen grove in\nOctober believe in fairies. And such people need no clumsy descriptive\npassages to aid their fancies. You others who have not seen it?\nThere shall be no poor weaving together of words. There shall be no\ndescription of orange and mauve and flame-colored sunsets, no juggling\nwith mists and clouds, and sunrises and purple mountains. Mountain\ndwellers and mountain lovers are a laconic tribe. They know the futility\nof words.\n\nBut the effect of the mountains on Fanny Brandeis. That is within our\nprovince. In the first place, they made her hungry. That was the crisp,\nheady air. The mountain road, to one who has never traveled it, is a\nthing of delicious thrills and near-terror. A narrow, perilous ribbon\nof road, cut in the side of the rock itself; a road all horseshoe curves\nand hairpin twists. Fanny found herself gasping. But that passed after\na time. Big Thompson canyon leaves no room for petty terror. And the\npongee person was so competent, so quietly sure, so angularly graceful\namong his brakes and levers. Fanny stole a side glance at him now and\nthen. He looked straight ahead. When you drive a mountain steamer you do\nlook straight ahead. A glance to the right or left is so likely to mean\ndeath, or at best a sousing in the Thompson that foams and rushes below.\n\nFanny ventured a question. “Do you know Mr. Heyl?”\n\n“Heyl? Took him down day before yesterday.”\n\n“Down?”\n\n“To the village. He's gone back east.”\n\nFanny was not quite sure whether the pang she felt was relief or\nconsternation.\n\nAt Estes village the blond god handed her over to a twin charioteer who\nwould drive her up the mountain road to the Inn that nestled in a valley\nnine thousand feet up the mountain. It was a drive Fanny never forgot.\nFenger, Ted, Haynes-Cooper, her work, her plans, her ambitions, seemed\nto dwindle to puny insignificance beside the vast grandeur that unfolded\nbefore her at every fresh turn in the road. Up they went, and up, and\nup, and the air was cold, but without a sting in it. It was dark when\nthe lights of the Inn twinkled out at them. The door was thrown open\nas they swung up the curve to the porch. A great log fire glowed in the\nfireplace. The dining room held only a dozen people, or thereabouts--a\ndozen weary, healthy people, in corduroys and sweaters and boots, whose\ncleanly talk was all about climbing and fishing, and horseback rides and\ntrails. And it was fried chicken night at the Inn. Fanny thought she was\ntoo utterly tired to eat, until she began to eat, and then she thought\nshe was too hungry ever to stop. After dinner she sat, for a moment,\nbefore the log fire in the low-ceilinged room, with its log walls, its\nrustic benches, and its soft-toned green and brown cushions. She forgot\nto be unhappy. She forgot to be anything but deliciously drowsy.\nAnd presently she climbed the winding stair whose newel post was a\nfire-marked tree trunk, richly colored, and curiously twisted. And so\nto her lamp-lighted room, very small, very clean, very quiet. She opened\nher window and looked out at the towering mass that was Long's Peak, and\nat the stars, and she heard the busy little brook that scurries through\nthe Inn yard on its way from the mountain to the valley. She undressed\nquickly, and crept into bed, meaning to be very, very miserable indeed.\nAnd the next thing she knew it was morning. A blue and gold October\nmorning. And the mountains!--but there is no describing a mountain.\nOne uses words, and they are futile. Fanny viewed them again, from her\nwindow, between pauses in dressing. And she meant, privately, to be\nmiserable again. But she could only think, somehow, of bacon and eggs,\nand coffee, and muffins.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\n\nHeyl's place. Fanny stood before it, key in hand (she had found it\nin the mail box, tied to a string), and she had a curious and restful\nfeeling, as if she had come home, after long wanderings. She smiled,\nwhimsically, and repeated her lesson to herself:\n\n“The fire's laid in the fireplace with fat pine knots that will blaze\nup at the touch of a match. My books are there, along the wall. The\nbedding's in the cedar chest, and the lamps are filled. There's tinned\nstuff in the pantry. And the mountains are there, girl, to make you\nclean and whole again....”\n\nShe stepped up to the little log-pillared porch and turned the key in\nthe lock. She opened the door wide, and walked in. And then she shut her\neyes for a moment. Because, if it shouldn't be true----\n\nBut there was a fire laid with fat pine knots. She walked straight over\nto it, and took her box of matches from her bag, struck one, and held\nit to the wood. They blazed like a torch. Books! Along the four walls,\nbooks. Fat, comfortable, used-looking books. Hundreds of them. A lamp on\nthe table, and beside it a pipe, blackened from much use. Fanny picked\nit up, smiling. She held it a moment in her hand, as though she expected\nto find it still warm.\n\n“It's like one of the fairy tales,” she thought, “the kind that repeats\nand repeats. The kind that says, `and she went into the next room, and\nit was as the good fairy had said.'”\n\nThere's tinned stuff in the pantry. She went into the tiny kitchen and\nopened the pantry door cautiously, being wary of mice. But it met her\neye in spotless array. Orderly rows of tins. Orderly rows of bottles.\nCoffee. Condensed milk. Beans. Spaghetti. Flour. Peaches. Pears.\n\nOff the bedroom there was an absurdly adequate little bathroom, with a\nzinc tub and an elaborate water-heating arrangement.\n\nFanny threw back her head and laughed as she hadn't laughed in months.\n“Wild life in the Rockies,” she said aloud. She went back to the\nbook-lined living room. The fire was crackling gloriously. It was a\nmany-windowed room, and each window framed an enchanting glimpse of\nmountain, flaming with aspens up to timber-line, and snow-capped at the\ntop. Fanny decided to wait until the fire had died down to a coal-bed.\nThen she banked it carefully, put on a heavy sweater and a cap, and made\nfor the outdoors. She struck out briskly, tenderfoot that she was. In\nfive minutes she was panting. Her heart was hammering suffocatingly. Her\nlungs ached. She stopped, trembling. Then she remembered. The altitude,\nof course. Heyl had boasted that his cabin stood at an altitude of over\nnine thousand feet. Well, she would have to get used to it. But she was\nsoon striding forward as briskly as before. She was a natural mountain\ndweller. The air, the altitude, speeded up her heart, her lungs, sent\nthe blood dancing through her veins. Figuratively, she was on tip-toe.\n\nThey had warned her, at the Inn, to take it slowly for the first few\ndays. They had asked no questions. Fanny learned to heed their advice.\nShe learned many more things in the next few days. She learned how to\nentice the chipmunks that crossed her path, streak o' sunshine, streak\no' shadow. She learned to broil bacon over a fire, with a forked stick.\nShe learned to ride trail ponies, and to bask in a sun-warmed spot on a\nwind-swept hill, and to tell time by the sun, and to give thanks for the\nbeauty of the world about her, and to leave the wild flowers unpicked,\nto put out her campfire with scrupulous care, and to destroy all rubbish\n(your true woodsman and mountaineer is as painstakingly neat as a French\nhousewife).\n\nShe was out of doors all day. At night she read for a while before the\nfire, but by nine her eyelids were heavy. She walked down to the Inn\nsometimes, but not often. One memorable night she went, with half a\ndozen others from the Inn, to the tiny one-room cabin of Oscar, the\nhandy man about the Inn, and there she listened to one of Oscar's\nfar-famed phonograph concerts. Oscar's phonograph had cost twenty-five\ndollars in Denver. It stood in one corner of his cabin, and its base was\na tree stump just five hundred years old, as you could tell for yourself\nby counting its rings. His cabin walls were gorgeous with pictures of\nMaxine Elliott in her palmy days, and blonde and sophisticated little\ngirls on vinegar calendars, posing bare-legged and self-conscious in\nblue calico and sunbonnets. You sat in the warm yellow glow of Oscar's\nlamp and were regaled with everything from the Swedish National\nAnthem to Mischa Elman's tenderest crooning. And Oscar sat rapt, his\nweather-beaten face a rich deep mahogany, his eyes bluer than any eyes\ncould ever be except in contrast with that ruddy countenance, his teeth\nso white that you found yourself watching for his smile that was so\ngently sweet and childlike. Oh, when Oscar put on his black pants and\nissued invitations for a musical evening one was sure to find his cabin\npacked. Eight did it, with squeezing.\n\nThis, then, was the atmosphere in which Fanny Brandeis found herself.\nAs far from Haynes-Cooper as anything could be. At the end of the first\nweek she found herself able to think clearly and unemotionally about\nTheodore, and about Fenger. She had even evolved a certain rather crude\nphilosophy out of the ruins that had tumbled about her ears. It was\nso crude, so unformed in her mind that it can hardly be set down. To\njustify one's own existence. That was all that life held or meant. But\nthat included all the lives that touched on yours. It had nothing to\ndo with success, as she had counted success heretofore. It was service,\nreally. It was living as--well, as Molly Brandeis had lived, helpfully,\nself-effacingly, magnificently. Fanny gave up trying to form the thing\nthat was growing in her mind. Perhaps, after all, it was too soon to\nexpect a complete understanding of that which had worked this change in\nher from that afternoon in Fenger's library.\n\nAfter the first few days she found less and less difficulty in climbing.\nHer astonished heart and lungs ceased to object so strenuously to the\nunaccustomed work. The Cabin Rock trail, for example, whose summit found\nher panting and exhausted at first, now seemed a mere stroll. She grew\nmore daring and ambitious. One day she climbed the Long's Peak trail to\ntimberline, and had tea at Timberline Cabin with Albert Edward Cobbins.\nAlbert Edward Cobbins, Englishman, erstwhile sailor, adventurer and\ngentleman, was the keeper of Timberline Cabin, and the loneliest man in\nthe Rockies. It was his duty to house overnight climbers bound for the\nPeak, sunrise parties and sunset parties, all too few now in the chill\nOctober season-end. Fanny was his first visitor in three days. He was\npathetically glad to see her.\n\n“I'll have tea for you,” he said, “in a jiffy. And I baked a pan of\nFrench rolls ten minutes ago. I had a feeling.”\n\nA magnificent specimen of a man, over six feet tall slim,\nbroad-shouldered, long-headed, and scrubbed-looking as only an\nEnglishman can be, there was something almost pathetic in the sight of\nhim bustling about the rickety little kitchen stove.\n\n“To-morrow,” said Fanny, over her tea, “I'm going to get an early start,\nreach here by noon, and go on to Boulder Field and maybe Keyhole.”\n\n“Better not, Miss. Not in October, when there's likely to be a snowstorm\nup there in a minute's notice.”\n\n“You'd come and find me, wouldn't you? They always do, in the books.”\n\n“Books are all very well, Miss. But I'm not a mountain man. The truth\nis I don't know my way fifty feet from this cabin. I got the job because\nI'm used to loneliness, and don't mind it, and because I can cook, d'you\nsee, having shipped as cook for years. But I'm a seafaring man, Miss. I\nwouldn't advise it, Miss. Another cup of tea?”\n\nBut Long's Peak, king of the range, had fascinated her from the first.\nShe knew that the climb to the summit would be impossible for her now,\nbut she had an overwhelming desire to see the terrifying bulk of it from\na point midway of the range. It beckoned her and intrigued her, as the\ndifficult always did.\n\nBy noon of the following day she had left Albert Edward's cabin (he\nstood looking after her in the doorway until she disappeared around the\nbend) and was jauntily following the trail that led to Boulder Field,\nthat sea of jagged rock a mile across. Soon she had left the tortured,\nwind-twisted timberline trees far behind. How pitiful Cabin Rock and\nTwin Sisters looked compared to this. She climbed easily and steadily,\nstopping for brief rests. Early in the week she had ridden down to the\nvillage, where she had bought climbing breeches and stout leggings. She\nlaughed at Albert Edward and his fears. By one o'clock she had reached\nBoulder Field. She found the rocks glazed with ice. Just over Keyhole,\nthat freakish vent in a wall of rock, the blue of the sky had changed\nto the gray of snow-clouds. Tenderfoot though she was, she knew that the\nclimb over Boulder Field would be perilous, if not impossible. She went\non, from rock to rock, for half an hour, then decided to turn back. A\nclap of thunder, that roared and crashed, and cracked up and down the\ncanyons and over the peaks, hastened her decision. She looked about her.\nPeak on peak. Purple and black and yellow masses, fantastic in their\nhugeness. Chasms. Canyons. Pyramids and minarets. And so near. So grim.\nSo ghastly desolate. And yet so threatening. And then Fanny Brandeis was\nseized with mountain terror. It is a disease recognized by mountain men\neverywhere, and it is panic, pure and simple. It is fear brought on by\nthe immensity and the silence of the mountains. A great horror of the\nvastness and ruggedness came upon her. It was colossal, it was crushing,\nit was nauseating.\n\nShe began to run. A mistake, that, when one is following a mountain\ntrail, at best an elusive thing. In five minutes she had lost the trail.\nShe stopped, and scolded herself sternly, and looked about her. She saw\nthe faint trail line again, or thought she saw it, and made toward it,\nand found it to be no trail at all. She knew that she must be not more\nthan an hour's walk from Timberline Cabin, and Albert Edward, and\nhis biscuits and tea. Why be frightened? It was absurd. But she was\nfrightened, horribly, harrowingly. The great, grim rock masses seemed\nto be shaking with silent laughter. She began to run again. She was very\ncold, and a piercing wind had sprung up. She kept on walking, doggedly,\nreasoning with herself quite calmly, and proud of her calmness. Which\nproves how terrified she really was. Then the snow came, not slowly,\nnot gradually, but a blanket of it, as it does come in the mountains,\nshutting off everything. And suddenly Fanny's terror vanished. She felt\nquite free from weariness. She was alive and tingling to her fingertips.\nThe psychology of fear is a fascinating thing. Fanny had reached\nthe second stage. She was quite taken out of herself. She forgot her\nstone-bruised feet. She was no longer conscious of cold. She ran now,\nfleetly, lightly, the ground seeming to spur her on. She had given up\nthe trail completely now. She told herself that if she ran on, down,\ndown, down, she must come to the valley sometime. Unless she was turned\nabout, and headed in the direction of one of those hideous chasms. She\nstopped a moment, peering through the snow curtain, but she could see\nnothing. She ran on lightly, laughing a little. Then her feet met a\nprojection, she stumbled, and fell flat over a slab of wood that jutted\nout of the ground. She lay there a moment, dazed. Then she sat up, and\nbent down to look at this thing that had tripped her. Probably a tree\ntrunk. Then she must be near timberline. She bent closer. It was a rough\nwooden slab. Closer still. There were words carved on it. She lay flat\nand managed to make them out painfully.\n\n“Here lies Sarah Cannon. Lay to rest, and died alone, April 26, 1893.”\n\nFanny had heard the story of Sarah Cannon, a stern spinster who had\nachieved the climb to the Peak, and who had met with mishap on the down\ntrail. Her guide had left her to go for help. When the relief party\nreturned, hours later, they had found her dead.\n\nFanny sprang up, filled with a furious energy. She felt strangely light\nand clear-headed. She ran on, stopped, ran again. Now she was\nmaking little short runs here and there. It was snowing furiously,\nvindictively. It seemed to her that she had been running for hours. It\nprobably was minutes. Suddenly she sank down, got to her feet again,\nstumbled on perhaps a dozen paces, and sank down again. It was as though\nher knees had turned liquid. She lay there, with her eyes shut.\n\n“I'm just resting,” she told herself. “In a minute I'll go on. In a\nminute. After I've rested.”\n\n“Hallo-o-o-o!” from somewhere on the other side of the snow blanket.\n“Hallo-o-o-o!” Fanny sat up, helloing shrilly, hysterically. She got to\nher feet, staggeringly. And Clarence Heyl walked toward her.\n\n“You ought to be spanked for this,” he said.\n\nFanny began to cry weakly. She felt no curiosity as to his being there.\nShe wasn't at all sure that he actually was there, for that matter.\nAt that thought she dug a frantic hand into his arm. He seemed to\nunderstand, for he said, “It's all right. I'm real enough. Can you\nwalk?”\n\n“Yes.” But she tried it and found she could not. She decided she was too\ntired to care. “I stumbled over a thing--a horrible thing--a gravestone.\nAnd I must have hurt my leg. I didn't know----”\n\nShe leaned against him, a dead weight. “Tell you what,” said Heyl,\ncheerfully. “You wait here. I'll go on down to Timberline Cabin for\nhelp, and come back.”\n\n“You couldn't manage it--alone? If I tried? If I tried to walk?”\n\n“Oh, impossible.” His tone was brisk. “Now you sit right down here.”\n She sank down obediently. She felt a little sorry for herself, and glad,\ntoo, and queer, and not at all cold. She looked up at him dumbly. He was\nsmiling. “All right?”\n\nShe nodded. He turned abruptly. The snow hid him from sight at once.\n\n“Here lies Sarah Cannon. Lay to rest and died alone, April 26, 1893.”\n\nShe sank down, and pillowed her head on her arms. She knew that this was\nthe end. She was very drowsy, and not at all sad. Happy, if anything.\n\n“You didn't really think I'd leave you, did you, Fan?”\n\nShe opened her eyes. Heyl was there. He reached down, and lifted her\nlightly to her feet. “Timberline Cabin's not a hundred yards away. I\njust did it to try you.”\n\nShe had spirit enough left to say, “Beast.”\n\nThen he swung her up, and carried her down the trail. He carried her,\nnot in his arms, as they do it in books and in the movies. He could not\nhave gone a hundred feet that way. He carried her over his shoulder,\nlike a sack of meal, by one arm and one leg, I regret to say. Any boy\nscout knows that trick, and will tell you what I mean. It is the most\neffectual carrying method known, though unromantic.\n\nAnd so they came to Timberline Cabin, and Albert Edward Cobbins was in\nthe doorway. Heyl put her down gently on the bench that ran alongside\nthe table. The hospitable table that bore two smoking cups of tea.\nFanny's lips were cracked, and the skin was peeled from her nose, and\nher hair was straggling and her eyes red-rimmed. She drank the tea in\ngreat gulps. And then she went into the tiny bunkroom, and tumbled into\none of the shelf-bunks, and slept.\n\nWhen she awoke she sat up in terror, and bumped her head against the\nbunk above, and called, “Clancy!”\n\n“Yep!” from the next room. He came to the door. The acrid smell of their\npipes was incense in her nostrils. “Rested?”\n\n“What time is it?”\n\n“Seven o'clock. Dinner time. Ham and eggs.”\n\nShe got up stiffly, and bathed her roughened face, and produced a powder\npad (they carry them in the face of danger, death, and dissolution) and\ndusted it over her scaly nose. She did her hair--her vigorous, abundant\nhair that shone in the lamplight, pulled down her blouse, surveyed\nher torn shoes ruefully, donned the khaki skirt that Albert Edward had\nmagically produced from somewhere to take the place of her breeches.\nShe dusted her shoes with a bit of rag, regarded herself steadily in the\nwavering mirror, and went in.\n\nThe two men were talking quietly. Albert Edward was moving deftly from\nstove to table. They both looked up as she came in, and she looked at\nHeyl. Their eyes held.\n\nAlbert Edward was as sporting a gentleman as the late dear king whose\nname he bore. He went out to tend Heyl's horse, he said. It was little\nhe knew of horses, and he rather feared them, as does a sailing man. But\nhe went, nevertheless.\n\nHeyl still looked at Fanny, and Fanny at him.\n\n“It's absurd,” said Fanny. “It's the kind of thing that doesn't happen.”\n\n“It's simple enough, really,” he answered. “I saw Ella Monahan in\nChicago, and she told me all she knew, and something of what she had\nguessed. I waited a few days and came back. I had to.” He smiled. “A\npretty job you've made of trying to be selfish.”\n\nAt that she smiled, too, pitifully enough, for her lower lip trembled.\nShe caught it between her teeth in a last sharp effort at self-control.\n“Don't!” she quavered. And then, in a panic, her two hands came up in a\nvain effort to hide the tears. She sank down on the rough bench by the\ntable, and the proud head came down on her arms so that there was a\nlittle clatter and tinkle among the supper things spread on the table.\nThen quiet.\n\nClarence Heyl stared. He stared, helplessly, as does a man who has\nnever, in all his life, been called upon to comfort a woman in tears.\nThen instinct came to his rescue. He made her side of the table in two\nstrides (your favorite film star couldn't have done it better), put his\ntwo hands on her shoulders and neatly shifted the bowed head from the\ncold, hard surface of the table top to the warm, rough, tobacco-scented\ncomfort of his coat. It rested there quite naturally. Just as naturally\nFanny's arm crept up, and about his neck. So they remained for a moment,\nuntil he bent so that his lips touched her hair. Her head came up at\nthat, sharply, so that it bumped his chin. They both laughed, looking\ninto each other's eyes, but at what they saw there they stopped laughing\nand were serious.\n\n“Dear,” said Heyl. “Dearest.” The lids drooped over Fanny's eyes. “Look\nat me,” said Heyl. So she tried to lift them again, bravely, and could\nnot. At that he bent his head and kissed Fanny Brandeis in the way a\nwoman wants to be kissed for the first time by the man she loves. It\nhurt her lips, that kiss, and her teeth, and the back of her neck, and\nit left her breathless, and set things whirling. When she opened her\neyes (they shut them at such times) he kissed her again, very tenderly,\nthis time, and lightly, and reassuringly. She returned that kiss, and,\nstrangely enough, it was the one that stayed in her memory long, long\nafter the other had faded.\n\n“Oh, Clancy, I've made such a mess of it all. Such a miserable mess.\nThe little girl in the red tam was worth ten of me. I don't see how you\ncan--care for me.”\n\n“You're the most wonderful woman in the world,” said Heyl, “and the most\nbeautiful and splendid.”\n\nHe must have meant it, for he was looking down at her as he said it, and\nwe know that the skin had been peeled off her nose by the mountain winds\nand sun, that her lips were cracked and her cheeks rough, and that she\nwas red-eyed and worn-looking. And she must have believed him, for she\nbrought his cheek down to hers with such a sigh of content, though she\nsaid, “But are we at all suited to each other?”\n\n“Probably not,” Heyl answered, briskly. “That's why we're going to be\nso terrifically happy. Some day I'll be passing the Singer building, and\nI'll glance up at it and think how pitiful it would look next to Long's\nPeak. And then I'll be off, probably, to these mountains.”\n\n“Or some day,” Fanny returned, “we'll be up here, and I'll remember,\nsuddenly, how Fifth Avenue looks on a bright afternoon between four and\nfive. And I'll be off, probably, to the Grand Central station.”\n\nAnd then began one of those beautiful and foolish conversations which\nall lovers have whose love has been a sure and steady growth. Thus:\n“When did you first begin to care,” etc. And, “That day we spent at the\ndunes, and you said so and so, did you mean this and that?”\n\nAlbert Edward Cobbins announced his approach by terrific stampings and\nscufflings, ostensibly for the purpose of ridding his boots of snow. He\nentered looking casual, and very nipped.\n\n“You're here for the night,” he said. “A regular blizzard. The greatest\npiece of luck I've had in a month.” He busied himself with the ham and\neggs and the teapot. “Hungry?”\n\n“Not a bit,” said Fanny and Heyl, together.\n\n“H'm,” said Albert Edward, and broke six eggs into the frying pan just\nthe same.\n\nAfter supper they aided Albert Edward in the process of washing up. When\neverything was tidy he lighted his most malignant pipe and told them\nseafaring yarns not necessarily true. Then he knocked the ashes out\nof his pipe and fell asleep there by the fire, effacing himself as\neffectually as one of three people can in a single room. They talked;\nlow-toned murmurings that they seemed to find exquisitely meaningful\nor witty, by turn. Fanny, rubbing a forefinger (his) along her\nweather-roughened nose, would say, “At least you've seen me at my\nworst.”\n\nOr he, mock serious: “I think I ought to tell you that I'm the kind of\nman who throws wet towels into the laundry hamper.”\n\nBut there was no mirth in Fanny's voice when she said, “Dear, do you\nthink Lasker will give me that job? You know he said, `When you want a\njob, come back.' Do you think he meant it?”\n\n“Lasker always means it.”\n\n“But,” fearfully, and shyly, too, “you don't think I may have lost my\ndrawing hand and my seeing eye, do you? As punishment?”\n\n“I do not. I think you've just found them, for keeps. There wasn't a\nwoman cartoonist in the country--or man, either, for that matter--could\ntouch you two years ago. In two more I'll be just Fanny Brandeis'\nhusband, that's all.”\n\nThey laughed together at that, so that Albert Edward Cobbins awoke with\na start and tried to look as if he had not been asleep, and failing,\nsmiled benignly and drowsily upon them."
