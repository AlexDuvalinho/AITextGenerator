 "text": "SUMMER\n\nby Edith Wharton\n\n\n1917\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nA girl came out of lawyer Royall's house, at the end of the one street\nof North Dormer, and stood on the doorstep.\n\nIt was the beginning of a June afternoon. The springlike transparent sky\nshed a rain of silver sunshine on the roofs of the village, and on the\npastures and larchwoods surrounding it. A little wind moved among the\nround white clouds on the shoulders of the hills, driving their shadows\nacross the fields and down the grassy road that takes the name of street\nwhen it passes through North Dormer. The place lies high and in the\nopen, and lacks the lavish shade of the more protected New England\nvillages. The clump of weeping-willows about the duck pond, and the\nNorway spruces in front of the Hatchard gate, cast almost the only\nroadside shadow between lawyer Royall's house and the point where, at\nthe other end of the village, the road rises above the church and skirts\nthe black hemlock wall enclosing the cemetery.\n\nThe little June wind, frisking down the street, shook the doleful\nfringes of the Hatchard spruces, caught the straw hat of a young man\njust passing under them, and spun it clean across the road into the\nduck-pond.\n\nAs he ran to fish it out the girl on lawyer Royall's doorstep noticed\nthat he was a stranger, that he wore city clothes, and that he was\nlaughing with all his teeth, as the young and careless laugh at such\nmishaps.\n\nHer heart contracted a little, and the shrinking that sometimes came\nover her when she saw people with holiday faces made her draw back into\nthe house and pretend to look for the key that she knew she had already\nput into her pocket. A narrow greenish mirror with a gilt eagle over it\nhung on the passage wall, and she looked critically at her reflection,\nwished for the thousandth time that she had blue eyes like Annabel\nBalch, the girl who sometimes came from Springfield to spend a week with\nold Miss Hatchard, straightened the sunburnt hat over her small swarthy\nface, and turned out again into the sunshine.\n\n“How I hate everything!” she murmured.\n\nThe young man had passed through the Hatchard gate, and she had the\nstreet to herself. North Dormer is at all times an empty place, and at\nthree o'clock on a June afternoon its few able-bodied men are off in\nthe fields or woods, and the women indoors, engaged in languid household\ndrudgery.\n\nThe girl walked along, swinging her key on a finger, and looking about\nher with the heightened attention produced by the presence of a stranger\nin a familiar place. What, she wondered, did North Dormer look like to\npeople from other parts of the world? She herself had lived there\nsince the age of five, and had long supposed it to be a place of some\nimportance. But about a year before, Mr. Miles, the new Episcopal\nclergyman at Hepburn, who drove over every other Sunday--when the roads\nwere not ploughed up by hauling--to hold a service in the North Dormer\nchurch, had proposed, in a fit of missionary zeal, to take the young\npeople down to Nettleton to hear an illustrated lecture on the Holy\nLand; and the dozen girls and boys who represented the future of North\nDormer had been piled into a farm-waggon, driven over the hills to\nHepburn, put into a way-train and carried to Nettleton.\n\nIn the course of that incredible day Charity Royall had, for the first\nand only time, experienced railway-travel, looked into shops with\nplate-glass fronts, tasted cocoanut pie, sat in a theatre, and listened\nto a gentleman saying unintelligible things before pictures that she\nwould have enjoyed looking at if his explanations had not prevented her\nfrom understanding them. This initiation had shown her that North Dormer\nwas a small place, and developed in her a thirst for information that\nher position as custodian of the village library had previously failed\nto excite. For a month or two she dipped feverishly and disconnectedly\ninto the dusty volumes of the Hatchard Memorial Library; then the\nimpression of Nettleton began to fade, and she found it easier to take\nNorth Dormer as the norm of the universe than to go on reading.\n\nThe sight of the stranger once more revived memories of Nettleton, and\nNorth Dormer shrank to its real size. As she looked up and down it, from\nlawyer Royall's faded red house at one end to the white church at the\nother, she pitilessly took its measure. There it lay, a weather-beaten\nsunburnt village of the hills, abandoned of men, left apart by railway,\ntrolley, telegraph, and all the forces that link life to life in modern\ncommunities. It had no shops, no theatres, no lectures, no “business\nblock”; only a church that was opened every other Sunday if the state\nof the roads permitted, and a library for which no new books had been\nbought for twenty years, and where the old ones mouldered undisturbed on\nthe damp shelves. Yet Charity Royall had always been told that she ought\nto consider it a privilege that her lot had been cast in North Dormer.\nShe knew that, compared to the place she had come from, North Dormer\nrepresented all the blessings of the most refined civilization. Everyone\nin the village had told her so ever since she had been brought there as\na child. Even old Miss Hatchard had said to her, on a terrible occasion\nin her life: “My child, you must never cease to remember that it was Mr.\nRoyall who brought you down from the Mountain.”\n\nShe had been “brought down from the Mountain”; from the scarred cliff\nthat lifted its sullen wall above the lesser slopes of Eagle Range,\nmaking a perpetual background of gloom to the lonely valley. The\nMountain was a good fifteen miles away, but it rose so abruptly from the\nlower hills that it seemed almost to cast its shadow over North Dormer.\nAnd it was like a great magnet drawing the clouds and scattering them\nin storm across the valley. If ever, in the purest summer sky, there\ntrailed a thread of vapour over North Dormer, it drifted to the Mountain\nas a ship drifts to a whirlpool, and was caught among the rocks, torn up\nand multiplied, to sweep back over the village in rain and darkness.\n\nCharity was not very clear about the Mountain; but she knew it was a bad\nplace, and a shame to have come from, and that, whatever befell her\nin North Dormer, she ought, as Miss Hatchard had once reminded her, to\nremember that she had been brought down from there, and hold her tongue\nand be thankful. She looked up at the Mountain, thinking of these\nthings, and tried as usual to be thankful. But the sight of the young\nman turning in at Miss Hatchard's gate had brought back the vision of\nthe glittering streets of Nettleton, and she felt ashamed of her old\nsun-hat, and sick of North Dormer, and jealously aware of Annabel Balch\nof Springfield, opening her blue eyes somewhere far off on glories\ngreater than the glories of Nettleton.\n\n“How I hate everything!” she said again.\n\nHalf way down the street she stopped at a weak-hinged gate. Passing\nthrough it, she walked down a brick path to a queer little brick temple\nwith white wooden columns supporting a pediment on which was inscribed\nin tarnished gold letters: “The Honorius Hatchard Memorial Library,\n1832.”\n\nHonorius Hatchard had been old Miss Hatchard's great-uncle; though she\nwould undoubtedly have reversed the phrase, and put forward, as her\nonly claim to distinction, the fact that she was his great-niece. For\nHonorius Hatchard, in the early years of the nineteenth century, had\nenjoyed a modest celebrity. As the marble tablet in the interior of\nthe library informed its infrequent visitors, he had possessed marked\nliterary gifts, written a series of papers called “The Recluse of Eagle\nRange,” enjoyed the acquaintance of Washington Irving and Fitz-Greene\nHalleck, and been cut off in his flower by a fever contracted in Italy.\nSuch had been the sole link between North Dormer and literature, a\nlink piously commemorated by the erection of the monument where Charity\nRoyall, every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon, sat at her desk under a\nfreckled steel engraving of the deceased author, and wondered if he felt\nany deader in his grave than she did in his library.\n\nEntering her prison-house with a listless step she took off her hat,\nhung it on a plaster bust of Minerva, opened the shutters, leaned out\nto see if there were any eggs in the swallow's nest above one of the\nwindows, and finally, seating herself behind the desk, drew out a\nroll of cotton lace and a steel crochet hook. She was not an expert\nworkwoman, and it had taken her many weeks to make the half-yard\nof narrow lace which she kept wound about the buckram back of a\ndisintegrated copy of “The Lamplighter.” But there was no other way of\ngetting any lace to trim her summer blouse, and since Ally Hawes, the\npoorest girl in the village, had shown herself in church with enviable\ntransparencies about the shoulders, Charity's hook had travelled faster.\nShe unrolled the lace, dug the hook into a loop, and bent to the task\nwith furrowed brows.\n\nSuddenly the door opened, and before she had raised her eyes she knew\nthat the young man she had seen going in at the Hatchard gate had\nentered the library.\n\nWithout taking any notice of her he began to move slowly about the\nlong vault-like room, his hands behind his back, his short-sighted eyes\npeering up and down the rows of rusty bindings. At length he reached the\ndesk and stood before her.\n\n“Have you a card-catalogue?” he asked in a pleasant abrupt voice; and\nthe oddness of the question caused her to drop her work.\n\n“A WHAT?”\n\n“Why, you know----” He broke off, and she became conscious that he was\nlooking at her for the first time, having apparently, on his entrance,\nincluded her in his general short-sighted survey as part of the\nfurniture of the library.\n\nThe fact that, in discovering her, he lost the thread of his remark,\ndid not escape her attention, and she looked down and smiled. He smiled\nalso.\n\n“No, I don't suppose you do know,” he corrected himself. “In fact, it\nwould be almost a pity----”\n\nShe thought she detected a slight condescension in his tone, and asked\nsharply: “Why?”\n\n“Because it's so much pleasanter, in a small library like this, to poke\nabout by one's self--with the help of the librarian.”\n\nHe added the last phrase so respectfully that she was mollified, and\nrejoined with a sigh: “I'm afraid I can't help you much.”\n\n“Why?” he questioned in his turn; and she replied that there weren't\nmany books anyhow, and that she'd hardly read any of them. “The worms\nare getting at them,” she added gloomily.\n\n“Are they? That's a pity, for I see there are some good ones.” He seemed\nto have lost interest in their conversation, and strolled away again,\napparently forgetting her. His indifference nettled her, and she picked\nup her work, resolved not to offer him the least assistance. Apparently\nhe did not need it, for he spent a long time with his back to her,\nlifting down, one after another, the tall cob-webby volumes from a\ndistant shelf.\n\n“Oh, I say!” he exclaimed; and looking up she saw that he had drawn out\nhis handkerchief and was carefully wiping the edges of the book in his\nhand. The action struck her as an unwarranted criticism on her care of\nthe books, and she said irritably: “It's not my fault if they're dirty.”\n\nHe turned around and looked at her with reviving interest. “Ah--then\nyou're not the librarian?”\n\n“Of course I am; but I can't dust all these books. Besides, nobody ever\nlooks at them, now Miss Hatchard's too lame to come round.”\n\n“No, I suppose not.” He laid down the book he had been wiping, and stood\nconsidering her in silence. She wondered if Miss Hatchard had sent\nhim round to pry into the way the library was looked after, and the\nsuspicion increased her resentment. “I saw you going into her house just\nnow, didn't I?” she asked, with the New England avoidance of the proper\nname. She was determined to find out why he was poking about among her\nbooks.\n\n“Miss Hatchard's house? Yes--she's my cousin and I'm staying there,” the\nyoung man answered; adding, as if to disarm a visible distrust: “My name\nis Harney--Lucius Harney. She may have spoken of me.”\n\n“No, she hasn't,” said Charity, wishing she could have said: “Yes, she\nhas.”\n\n“Oh, well----” said Miss Hatchard's cousin with a laugh; and after\nanother pause, during which it occurred to Charity that her answer\nhad not been encouraging, he remarked: “You don't seem strong on\narchitecture.”\n\nHer bewilderment was complete: the more she wished to appear to\nunderstand him the more unintelligible his remarks became. He reminded\nher of the gentleman who had “explained” the pictures at Nettleton, and\nthe weight of her ignorance settled down on her again like a pall.\n\n“I mean, I can't see that you have any books on the old houses about\nhere. I suppose, for that matter, this part of the country hasn't been\nmuch explored. They all go on doing Plymouth and Salem. So stupid. My\ncousin's house, now, is remarkable. This place must have had a past--it\nmust have been more of a place once.” He stopped short, with the blush\nof a shy man who overhears himself, and fears he has been voluble. “I'm\nan architect, you see, and I'm hunting up old houses in these parts.”\n\nShe stared. “Old houses? Everything's old in North Dormer, isn't it? The\nfolks are, anyhow.”\n\nHe laughed, and wandered away again.\n\n“Haven't you any kind of a history of the place? I think there was one\nwritten about 1840: a book or pamphlet about its first settlement,” he\npresently said from the farther end of the room.\n\nShe pressed her crochet hook against her lip and pondered. There was\nsuch a work, she knew: “North Dormer and the Early Townships of Eagle\nCounty.” She had a special grudge against it because it was a limp\nweakly book that was always either falling off the shelf or slipping\nback and disappearing if one squeezed it in between sustaining volumes.\nShe remembered, the last time she had picked it up, wondering how anyone\ncould have taken the trouble to write a book about North Dormer and its\nneighbours: Dormer, Hamblin, Creston and Creston River. She knew them\nall, mere lost clusters of houses in the folds of the desolate ridges:\nDormer, where North Dormer went for its apples; Creston River, where\nthere used to be a paper-mill, and its grey walls stood decaying by the\nstream; and Hamblin, where the first snow always fell. Such were their\ntitles to fame.\n\nShe got up and began to move about vaguely before the shelves. But she\nhad no idea where she had last put the book, and something told her that\nit was going to play her its usual trick and remain invisible. It was\nnot one of her lucky days.\n\n“I guess it's somewhere,” she said, to prove her zeal; but she spoke\nwithout conviction, and felt that her words conveyed none.\n\n“Oh, well----” he said again. She knew he was going, and wished more\nthan ever to find the book.\n\n“It will be for next time,” he added; and picking up the volume he had\nlaid on the desk he handed it to her. “By the way, a little air and sun\nwould do this good; it's rather valuable.”\n\nHe gave her a nod and smile, and passed out.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThe hours of the Hatchard Memorial librarian were from three to five;\nand Charity Royall's sense of duty usually kept her at her desk until\nnearly half-past four.\n\nBut she had never perceived that any practical advantage thereby\naccrued either to North Dormer or to herself; and she had no scruple\nin decreeing, when it suited her, that the library should close an hour\nearlier. A few minutes after Mr. Harney's departure she formed this\ndecision, put away her lace, fastened the shutters, and turned the key\nin the door of the temple of knowledge.\n\nThe street upon which she emerged was still empty: and after glancing up\nand down it she began to walk toward her house. But instead of entering\nshe passed on, turned into a field-path and mounted to a pasture on the\nhillside. She let down the bars of the gate, followed a trail along the\ncrumbling wall of the pasture, and walked on till she reached a knoll\nwhere a clump of larches shook out their fresh tassels to the wind.\nThere she lay down on the slope, tossed off her hat and hid her face in\nthe grass.\n\nShe was blind and insensible to many things, and dimly knew it; but to\nall that was light and air, perfume and colour, every drop of blood in\nher responded. She loved the roughness of the dry mountain grass under\nher palms, the smell of the thyme into which she crushed her face, the\nfingering of the wind in her hair and through her cotton blouse, and the\ncreak of the larches as they swayed to it.\n\nShe often climbed up the hill and lay there alone for the mere pleasure\nof feeling the wind and of rubbing her cheeks in the grass. Generally\nat such times she did not think of anything, but lay immersed in an\ninarticulate well-being. Today the sense of well-being was intensified\nby her joy at escaping from the library. She liked well enough to have a\nfriend drop in and talk to her when she was on duty, but she hated to be\nbothered about books. How could she remember where they were, when they\nwere so seldom asked for? Orma Fry occasionally took out a novel, and\nher brother Ben was fond of what he called “jography,” and of books\nrelating to trade and bookkeeping; but no one else asked for anything\nexcept, at intervals, “Uncle Tom's Cabin,” or “Opening of a Chestnut\nBurr,” or Longfellow. She had these under her hand, and could have\nfound them in the dark; but unexpected demands came so rarely that they\nexasperated her like an injustice....\n\nShe had liked the young man's looks, and his short-sighted eyes, and his\nodd way of speaking, that was abrupt yet soft, just as his hands were\nsun-burnt and sinewy, yet with smooth nails like a woman's. His hair was\nsunburnt-looking too, or rather the colour of bracken after frost; his\neyes grey, with the appealing look of the shortsighted, his smile shy\nyet confident, as if he knew lots of things she had never dreamed of,\nand yet wouldn't for the world have had her feel his superiority. But\nshe did feel it, and liked the feeling; for it was new to her. Poor and\nignorant as she was, and knew herself to be--humblest of the humble\neven in North Dormer, where to come from the Mountain was the worst\ndisgrace--yet in her narrow world she had always ruled. It was partly,\nof course, owing to the fact that lawyer Royall was “the biggest man\nin North Dormer”; so much too big for it, in fact, that outsiders,\nwho didn't know, always wondered how it held him. In spite of\neverything--and in spite even of Miss Hatchard--lawyer Royall ruled in\nNorth Dormer; and Charity ruled in lawyer Royall's house. She had never\nput it to herself in those terms; but she knew her power, knew what it\nwas made of, and hated it. Confusedly, the young man in the library\nhad made her feel for the first time what might be the sweetness of\ndependence.\n\nShe sat up, brushed the bits of grass from her hair, and looked down on\nthe house where she held sway. It stood just below her, cheerless and\nuntended, its faded red front divided from the road by a “yard” with\na path bordered by gooseberry bushes, a stone well overgrown with\ntraveller's joy, and a sickly Crimson Rambler tied to a fan-shaped\nsupport, which Mr. Royall had once brought up from Hepburn to please\nher. Behind the house a bit of uneven ground with clothes-lines strung\nacross it stretched up to a dry wall, and beyond the wall a patch of\ncorn and a few rows of potatoes strayed vaguely into the adjoining\nwilderness of rock and fern.\n\nCharity could not recall her first sight of the house. She had been told\nthat she was ill of a fever when she was brought down from the Mountain;\nand she could only remember waking one day in a cot at the foot of Mrs.\nRoyall's bed, and opening her eyes on the cold neatness of the room that\nwas afterward to be hers.\n\nMrs. Royall died seven or eight years later; and by that time Charity\nhad taken the measure of most things about her. She knew that Mrs.\nRoyall was sad and timid and weak; she knew that lawyer Royall was harsh\nand violent, and still weaker. She knew that she had been christened\nCharity (in the white church at the other end of the village) to\ncommemorate Mr. Royall's disinterestedness in “bringing her down,” and\nto keep alive in her a becoming sense of her dependence; she knew that\nMr. Royall was her guardian, but that he had not legally adopted her,\nthough everybody spoke of her as Charity Royall; and she knew why he had\ncome back to live at North Dormer, instead of practising at Nettleton,\nwhere he had begun his legal career.\n\nAfter Mrs. Royall's death there was some talk of sending her to a\nboarding-school. Miss Hatchard suggested it, and had a long conference\nwith Mr. Royall, who, in pursuance of her plan, departed one day for\nStarkfield to visit the institution she recommended. He came back the\nnext night with a black face; worse, Charity observed, than she had ever\nseen him; and by that time she had had some experience.\n\nWhen she asked him how soon she was to start he answered shortly, “You\nain't going,” and shut himself up in the room he called his office;\nand the next day the lady who kept the school at Starkfield wrote that\n“under the circumstances” she was afraid she could not make room just\nthen for another pupil.\n\nCharity was disappointed; but she understood. It wasn't the temptations\nof Starkfield that had been Mr. Royall's undoing; it was the thought of\nlosing her. He was a dreadfully “lonesome” man; she had made that out\nbecause she was so “lonesome” herself. He and she, face to face in that\nsad house, had sounded the depths of isolation; and though she felt\nno particular affection for him, and not the slightest gratitude, she\npitied him because she was conscious that he was superior to the people\nabout him, and that she was the only being between him and solitude.\nTherefore, when Miss Hatchard sent for her a day or two later, to talk\nof a school at Nettleton, and to say that this time a friend of hers\nwould “make the necessary arrangements,” Charity cut her short with the\nannouncement that she had decided not to leave North Dormer.\n\nMiss Hatchard reasoned with her kindly, but to no purpose; she simply\nrepeated: “I guess Mr. Royall's too lonesome.”\n\nMiss Hatchard blinked perplexedly behind her eye-glasses. Her long frail\nface was full of puzzled wrinkles, and she leant forward, resting her\nhands on the arms of her mahogany armchair, with the evident desire to\nsay something that ought to be said.\n\n“The feeling does you credit, my dear.”\n\nShe looked about the pale walls of her sitting-room, seeking counsel of\nancestral daguerreotypes and didactic samplers; but they seemed to make\nutterance more difficult.\n\n“The fact is, it's not only--not only because of the advantages. There\nare other reasons. You're too young to understand----”\n\n“Oh, no, I ain't,” said Charity harshly; and Miss Hatchard blushed to\nthe roots of her blonde cap. But she must have felt a vague relief at\nhaving her explanation cut short, for she concluded, again invoking the\ndaguerreotypes: “Of course I shall always do what I can for you; and in\ncase... in case... you know you can always come to me....”\n\nLawyer Royall was waiting for Charity in the porch when she returned\nfrom this visit. He had shaved, and brushed his black coat, and looked a\nmagnificent monument of a man; at such moments she really admired him.\n\n“Well,” he said, “is it settled?”\n\n“Yes, it's settled. I ain't going.”\n\n“Not to the Nettleton school?”\n\n“Not anywhere.”\n\nHe cleared his throat and asked sternly: “Why?”\n\n“I'd rather not,” she said, swinging past him on her way to her room.\nIt was the following week that he brought her up the Crimson Rambler and\nits fan from Hepburn. He had never given her anything before.\n\nThe next outstanding incident of her life had happened two years later,\nwhen she was seventeen. Lawyer Royall, who hated to go to Nettleton,\nhad been called there in connection with a case. He still exercised\nhis profession, though litigation languished in North Dormer and its\noutlying hamlets; and for once he had had an opportunity that he could\nnot afford to refuse. He spent three days in Nettleton, won his case,\nand came back in high good-humour. It was a rare mood with him, and\nmanifested itself on this occasion by his talking impressively at the\nsupper-table of the “rousing welcome” his old friends had given him. He\nwound up confidentially: “I was a damn fool ever to leave Nettleton. It\nwas Mrs. Royall that made me do it.”\n\nCharity immediately perceived that something bitter had happened to him,\nand that he was trying to talk down the recollection. She went up to bed\nearly, leaving him seated in moody thought, his elbows propped on the\nworn oilcloth of the supper table. On the way up she had extracted from\nhis overcoat pocket the key of the cupboard where the bottle of whiskey\nwas kept.\n\nShe was awakened by a rattling at her door and jumped out of bed. She\nheard Mr. Royall's voice, low and peremptory, and opened the door,\nfearing an accident. No other thought had occurred to her; but when\nshe saw him in the doorway, a ray from the autumn moon falling on his\ndiscomposed face, she understood.\n\nFor a moment they looked at each other in silence; then, as he put his\nfoot across the threshold, she stretched out her arm and stopped him.\n\n“You go right back from here,” she said, in a shrill voice that startled\nher; “you ain't going to have that key tonight.”\n\n“Charity, let me in. I don't want the key. I'm a lonesome man,” he\nbegan, in the deep voice that sometimes moved her.\n\nHer heart gave a startled plunge, but she continued to hold him back\ncontemptuously. “Well, I guess you made a mistake, then. This ain't your\nwife's room any longer.”\n\nShe was not frightened, she simply felt a deep disgust; and perhaps he\ndivined it or read it in her face, for after staring at her a moment\nhe drew back and turned slowly away from the door. With her ear to her\nkeyhole she heard him feel his way down the dark stairs, and toward\nthe kitchen; and she listened for the crash of the cupboard panel, but\ninstead she heard him, after an interval, unlock the door of the house,\nand his heavy steps came to her through the silence as he walked down\nthe path. She crept to the window and saw his bent figure striding up\nthe road in the moonlight. Then a belated sense of fear came to her\nwith the consciousness of victory, and she slipped into bed, cold to the\nbone.\n\n\nA day or two later poor Eudora Skeff, who for twenty years had been the\ncustodian of the Hatchard library, died suddenly of pneumonia; and the\nday after the funeral Charity went to see Miss Hatchard, and asked to be\nappointed librarian. The request seemed to surprise Miss Hatchard: she\nevidently questioned the new candidate's qualifications.\n\n“Why, I don't know, my dear. Aren't you rather too young?” she\nhesitated.\n\n“I want to earn some money,” Charity merely answered.\n\n“Doesn't Mr. Royall give you all you require? No one is rich in North\nDormer.”\n\n“I want to earn money enough to get away.”\n\n“To get away?” Miss Hatchard's puzzled wrinkles deepened, and there was\na distressful pause. “You want to leave Mr. Royall?”\n\n“Yes: or I want another woman in the house with me,” said Charity\nresolutely.\n\nMiss Hatchard clasped her nervous hands about the arms of her chair. Her\neyes invoked the faded countenances on the wall, and after a faint cough\nof indecision she brought out: “The... the housework's too hard for you,\nI suppose?”\n\nCharity's heart grew cold. She understood that Miss Hatchard had no\nhelp to give her and that she would have to fight her way out of her\ndifficulty alone. A deeper sense of isolation overcame her; she felt\nincalculably old. “She's got to be talked to like a baby,” she thought,\nwith a feeling of compassion for Miss Hatchard's long immaturity. “Yes,\nthat's it,” she said aloud. “The housework's too hard for me: I've been\ncoughing a good deal this fall.”\n\nShe noted the immediate effect of this suggestion. Miss Hatchard paled\nat the memory of poor Eudora's taking-off, and promised to do what she\ncould. But of course there were people she must consult: the clergyman,\nthe selectmen of North Dormer, and a distant Hatchard relative at\nSpringfield. “If you'd only gone to school!” she sighed. She followed\nCharity to the door, and there, in the security of the threshold, said\nwith a glance of evasive appeal: “I know Mr. Royall is... trying at\ntimes; but his wife bore with him; and you must always remember,\nCharity, that it was Mr. Royall who brought you down from the Mountain.”\n Charity went home and opened the door of Mr. Royall's “office.” He was\nsitting there by the stove reading Daniel Webster's speeches. They had\nmet at meals during the five days that had elapsed since he had come to\nher door, and she had walked at his side at Eudora's funeral; but they\nhad not spoken a word to each other.\n\nHe glanced up in surprise as she entered, and she noticed that he\nwas unshaved, and that he looked unusually old; but as she had always\nthought of him as an old man the change in his appearance did not move\nher. She told him she had been to see Miss Hatchard, and with what\nobject. She saw that he was astonished; but he made no comment.\n\n“I told her the housework was too hard for me, and I wanted to earn the\nmoney to pay for a hired girl. But I ain't going to pay for her: you've\ngot to. I want to have some money of my own.”\n\nMr. Royall's bushy black eyebrows were drawn together in a frown, and he\nsat drumming with ink-stained nails on the edge of his desk.\n\n“What do you want to earn money for?” he asked.\n\n“So's to get away when I want to.”\n\n“Why do you want to get away?”\n\nHer contempt flashed out. “Do you suppose anybody'd stay at North Dormer\nif they could help it? You wouldn't, folks say!”\n\nWith lowered head he asked: “Where'd you go to?”\n\n“Anywhere where I can earn my living. I'll try here first, and if I\ncan't do it here I'll go somewhere else. I'll go up the Mountain if I\nhave to.” She paused on this threat, and saw that it had taken effect.\n“I want you should get Miss Hatchard and the selectmen to take me at the\nlibrary: and I want a woman here in the house with me,” she repeated.\n\nMr. Royall had grown exceedingly pale. When she ended he stood up\nponderously, leaning against the desk; and for a second or two they\nlooked at each other.\n\n“See here,” he said at length as though utterance were difficult,\n“there's something I've been wanting to say to you; I'd ought to have\nsaid it before. I want you to marry me.”\n\nThe girl still stared at him without moving. “I want you to marry me,”\n he repeated, clearing his throat. “The minister'll be up here next\nSunday and we can fix it up then. Or I'll drive you down to Hepburn to\nthe Justice, and get it done there. I'll do whatever you say.” His\neyes fell under the merciless stare she continued to fix on him, and\nhe shifted his weight uneasily from one foot to the other. As he\nstood there before her, unwieldy, shabby, disordered, the purple veins\ndistorting the hands he pressed against the desk, and his long orator's\njaw trembling with the effort of his avowal, he seemed like a hideous\nparody of the fatherly old man she had always known.\n\n“Marry you? Me?” she burst out with a scornful laugh. “Was that what you\ncame to ask me the other night? What's come over you, I wonder? How long\nis it since you've looked at yourself in the glass?” She straightened\nherself, insolently conscious of her youth and strength. “I suppose\nyou think it would be cheaper to marry me than to keep a hired girl.\nEverybody knows you're the closest man in Eagle County; but I guess\nyou're not going to get your mending done for you that way twice.”\n\nMr. Royall did not move while she spoke. His face was ash-coloured and\nhis black eyebrows quivered as though the blaze of her scorn had blinded\nhim. When she ceased he held up his hand.\n\n“That'll do--that'll about do,” he said. He turned to the door and took\nhis hat from the hat-peg. On the threshold he paused. “People ain't been\nfair to me--from the first they ain't been fair to me,” he said. Then he\nwent out.\n\nA few days later North Dormer learned with surprise that Charity had\nbeen appointed librarian of the Hatchard Memorial at a salary of eight\ndollars a month, and that old Verena Marsh, from the Creston Almshouse,\nwas coming to live at lawyer Royall's and do the cooking.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIt was not in the room known at the red house as Mr. Royall's “office”\n that he received his infrequent clients. Professional dignity and\nmasculine independence made it necessary that he should have a real\noffice, under a different roof; and his standing as the only lawyer of\nNorth Dormer required that the roof should be the same as that which\nsheltered the Town Hall and the post-office.\n\nIt was his habit to walk to this office twice a day, morning and\nafternoon. It was on the ground floor of the building, with a separate\nentrance, and a weathered name-plate on the door. Before going in\nhe stepped in to the post-office for his mail--usually an empty\nceremony--said a word or two to the town-clerk, who sat across the\npassage in idle state, and then went over to the store on the opposite\ncorner, where Carrick Fry, the storekeeper, always kept a chair for him,\nand where he was sure to find one or two selectmen leaning on the long\ncounter, in an atmosphere of rope, leather, tar and coffee-beans. Mr.\nRoyall, though monosyllabic at home, was not averse, in certain moods,\nto imparting his views to his fellow-townsmen; perhaps, also, he was\nunwilling that his rare clients should surprise him sitting, clerkless\nand unoccupied, in his dusty office. At any rate, his hours there were\nnot much longer or more regular than Charity's at the library; the rest\nof the time he spent either at the store or in driving about the country\non business connected with the insurance companies that he represented,\nor in sitting at home reading Bancroft's History of the United States\nand the speeches of Daniel Webster.\n\nSince the day when Charity had told him that she wished to succeed\nto Eudora Skeff's post their relations had undefinably but definitely\nchanged. Lawyer Royall had kept his word. He had obtained the place for\nher at the cost of considerable maneuvering, as she guessed from the\nnumber of rival candidates, and from the acerbity with which two of\nthem, Orma Fry and the eldest Targatt girl, treated her for nearly a\nyear afterward. And he had engaged Verena Marsh to come up from\nCreston and do the cooking. Verena was a poor old widow, doddering and\nshiftless: Charity suspected that she came for her keep. Mr. Royall was\ntoo close a man to give a dollar a day to a smart girl when he could\nget a deaf pauper for nothing. But at any rate, Verena was there, in the\nattic just over Charity, and the fact that she was deaf did not greatly\ntrouble the young girl.\n\nCharity knew that what had happened on that hateful night would not\nhappen again. She understood that, profoundly as she had despised Mr.\nRoyall ever since, he despised himself still more profoundly. If she had\nasked for a woman in the house it was far less for her own defense than\nfor his humiliation. She needed no one to defend her: his humbled pride\nwas her surest protection. He had never spoken a word of excuse\nor extenuation; the incident was as if it had never been. Yet its\nconsequences were latent in every word that he and she exchanged, in\nevery glance they instinctively turned from each other. Nothing now\nwould ever shake her rule in the red house.\n\nOn the night of her meeting with Miss Hatchard's cousin Charity lay in\nbed, her bare arms clasped under her rough head, and continued to think\nof him. She supposed that he meant to spend some time in North Dormer.\nHe had said he was looking up the old houses in the neighbourhood; and\nthough she was not very clear as to his purpose, or as to why anyone\nshould look for old houses, when they lay in wait for one on every\nroadside, she understood that he needed the help of books, and resolved\nto hunt up the next day the volume she had failed to find, and any\nothers that seemed related to the subject.\n\nNever had her ignorance of life and literature so weighed on her as in\nreliving the short scene of her discomfiture. “It's no use trying to be\nanything in this place,” she muttered to her pillow; and she shrivelled\nat the vision of vague metropolises, shining super-Nettletons,\nwhere girls in better clothes than Belle Balch's talked fluently of\narchitecture to young men with hands like Lucius Harney's. Then she\nremembered his sudden pause when he had come close to the desk and had\nhis first look at her. The sight had made him forget what he was going\nto say; she recalled the change in his face, and jumping up she ran over\nthe bare boards to her washstand, found the matches, lit a candle, and\nlifted it to the square of looking-glass on the white-washed wall. Her\nsmall face, usually so darkly pale, glowed like a rose in the faint orb\nof light, and under her rumpled hair her eyes seemed deeper and larger\nthan by day. Perhaps after all it was a mistake to wish they were blue.\nA clumsy band and button fastened her unbleached night-gown about the\nthroat. She undid it, freed her thin shoulders, and saw herself a bride\nin low-necked satin, walking down an aisle with Lucius Harney. He would\nkiss her as they left the church.... She put down the candle and covered\nher face with her hands as if to imprison the kiss. At that moment she\nheard Mr. Royall's step as he came up the stairs to bed, and a fierce\nrevulsion of feeling swept over her. Until then she had merely despised\nhim; now deep hatred of him filled her heart. He became to her a\nhorrible old man....\n\n\nThe next day, when Mr. Royall came back to dinner, they faced each other\nin silence as usual. Verena's presence at the table was an excuse for\ntheir not talking, though her deafness would have permitted the freest\ninterchange of confidences. But when the meal was over, and Mr. Royall\nrose from the table, he looked back at Charity, who had stayed to help\nthe old woman clear away the dishes.\n\n“I want to speak to you a minute,” he said; and she followed him across\nthe passage, wondering.\n\nHe seated himself in his black horse-hair armchair, and she leaned\nagainst the window, indifferently. She was impatient to be gone to the\nlibrary, to hunt for the book on North Dormer.\n\n“See here,” he said, “why ain't you at the library the days you're\nsupposed to be there?”\n\nThe question, breaking in on her mood of blissful abstraction, deprived\nher of speech, and she stared at him for a moment without answering.\n\n“Who says I ain't?”\n\n“There's been some complaints made, it appears. Miss Hatchard sent for\nme this morning----”\n\nCharity's smouldering resentment broke into a blaze. “I know! Orma Fry,\nand that toad of a Targatt girl and Ben Fry, like as not. He's going\nround with her. The low-down sneaks--I always knew they'd try to have me\nout! As if anybody ever came to the library, anyhow!”\n\n“Somebody did yesterday, and you weren't there.”\n\n“Yesterday?” she laughed at her happy recollection. “At what time wasn't\nI there yesterday, I'd like to know?”\n\n“Round about four o'clock.”\n\nCharity was silent. She had been so steeped in the dreamy remembrance of\nyoung Harney's visit that she had forgotten having deserted her post as\nsoon as he had left the library.\n\n“Who came at four o'clock?”\n\n“Miss Hatchard did.”\n\n“Miss Hatchard? Why, she ain't ever been near the place since she's been\nlame. She couldn't get up the steps if she tried.”\n\n“She can be helped up, I guess. She was yesterday, anyhow, by the\nyoung fellow that's staying with her. He found you there, I understand,\nearlier in the afternoon; and he went back and told Miss Hatchard the\nbooks were in bad shape and needed attending to. She got excited, and\nhad herself wheeled straight round; and when she got there the place was\nlocked. So she sent for me, and told me about that, and about the other\ncomplaints. She claims you've neglected things, and that she's going to\nget a trained librarian.”\n\nCharity had not moved while he spoke. She stood with her head thrown\nback against the window-frame, her arms hanging against her sides, and\nher hands so tightly clenched that she felt, without knowing what hurt\nher, the sharp edge of her nails against her palms.\n\nOf all Mr. Royall had said she had retained only the phrase: “He told\nMiss Hatchard the books were in bad shape.” What did she care for the\nother charges against her? Malice or truth, she despised them as she\ndespised her detractors. But that the stranger to whom she had felt\nherself so mysteriously drawn should have betrayed her! That at the\nvery moment when she had fled up the hillside to think of him more\ndeliciously he should have been hastening home to denounce her\nshort-comings! She remembered how, in the darkness of her room, she had\ncovered her face to press his imagined kiss closer; and her heart raged\nagainst him for the liberty he had not taken.\n\n“Well, I'll go,” she said suddenly. “I'll go right off.”\n\n“Go where?” She heard the startled note in Mr. Royall's voice.\n\n“Why, out of their old library: straight out, and never set foot in\nit again. They needn't think I'm going to wait round and let them say\nthey've discharged me!”\n\n“Charity--Charity Royall, you listen----” he began, getting heavily out\nof his chair; but she waved him aside, and walked out of the room.\n\nUpstairs she took the library key from the place where she always hid it\nunder her pincushion--who said she wasn't careful?--put on her hat, and\nswept down again and out into the street. If Mr. Royall heard her go\nhe made no motion to detain her: his sudden rages probably made him\nunderstand the uselessness of reasoning with hers.\n\nShe reached the brick temple, unlocked the door and entered into the\nglacial twilight. “I'm glad I'll never have to sit in this old vault\nagain when other folks are out in the sun!” she said aloud as the\nfamiliar chill took her. She looked with abhorrence at the long dingy\nrows of books, the sheep-nosed Minerva on her black pedestal, and the\nmild-faced young man in a high stock whose effigy pined above her desk.\nShe meant to take out of the drawer her roll of lace and the library\nregister, and go straight to Miss Hatchard to announce her resignation.\nBut suddenly a great desolation overcame her, and she sat down and laid\nher face against the desk. Her heart was ravaged by life's cruelest\ndiscovery: the first creature who had come toward her out of the\nwilderness had brought her anguish instead of joy. She did not cry;\ntears came hard to her, and the storms of her heart spent themselves\ninwardly. But as she sat there in her dumb woe she felt her life to be\ntoo desolate, too ugly and intolerable.\n\n“What have I ever done to it, that it should hurt me so?” she groaned,\nand pressed her fists against her lids, which were beginning to swell\nwith weeping.\n\n“I won't--I won't go there looking like a horror!” she muttered,\nspringing up and pushing back her hair as if it stifled her. She opened\nthe drawer, dragged out the register, and turned toward the door. As\nshe did so it opened, and the young man from Miss Hatchard's came in\nwhistling.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nHe stopped and lifted his hat with a shy smile. “I beg your pardon,” he\nsaid. “I thought there was no one here.”\n\nCharity stood before him, barring his way. “You can't come in. The\nlibrary ain't open to the public Wednesdays.”\n\n“I know it's not; but my cousin gave me her key.”\n\n“Miss Hatchard's got no right to give her key to other folks, any more'n\nI have. I'm the librarian and I know the by-laws. This is my library.”\n\nThe young man looked profoundly surprised.\n\n“Why, I know it is; I'm so sorry if you mind my coming.”\n\n“I suppose you came to see what more you could say to set her against\nme? But you needn't trouble: it's my library today, but it won't be\nthis time tomorrow. I'm on the way now to take her back the key and the\nregister.”\n\nYoung Harney's face grew grave, but without betraying the consciousness\nof guilt she had looked for.\n\n“I don't understand,” he said. “There must be some mistake. Why should I\nsay things against you to Miss Hatchard--or to anyone?”\n\nThe apparent evasiveness of the reply caused Charity's indignation to\noverflow. “I don't know why you should. I could understand Orma Fry's\ndoing it, because she's always wanted to get me out of here ever since\nthe first day. I can't see why, when she's got her own home, and her\nfather to work for her; nor Ida Targatt, neither, when she got a legacy\nfrom her step-brother on'y last year. But anyway we all live in the\nsame place, and when it's a place like North Dormer it's enough to make\npeople hate each other just to have to walk down the same street every\nday. But you don't live here, and you don't know anything about any of\nus, so what did you have to meddle for? Do you suppose the other girls'd\nhave kept the books any better'n I did? Why, Orma Fry don't hardly know\na book from a flat-iron! And what if I don't always sit round here\ndoing nothing till it strikes five up at the church? Who cares if the\nlibrary's open or shut? Do you suppose anybody ever comes here for\nbooks? What they'd like to come for is to meet the fellows they're going\nwith if I'd let 'em. But I wouldn't let Bill Sollas from over the hill\nhang round here waiting for the youngest Targatt girl, because I know\nhim... that's all... even if I don't know about books all I ought to....”\n\nShe stopped with a choking in her throat. Tremors of rage were running\nthrough her, and she steadied herself against the edge of the desk lest\nhe should see her weakness.\n\nWhat he saw seemed to affect him deeply, for he grew red under his\nsunburn, and stammered out: “But, Miss Royall, I assure you... I assure\nyou....”\n\nHis distress inflamed her anger, and she regained her voice to fling\nback: “If I was you I'd have the nerve to stick to what I said!”\n\nThe taunt seemed to restore his presence of mind. “I hope I should if I\nknew; but I don't. Apparently something disagreeable has happened, for\nwhich you think I'm to blame. But I don't know what it is, because I've\nbeen up on Eagle Ridge ever since the early morning.”\n\n“I don't know where you've been this morning, but I know you were here\nin this library yesterday; and it was you that went home and told your\ncousin the books were in bad shape, and brought her round to see how I'd\nneglected them.”\n\nYoung Harney looked sincerely concerned. “Was that what you were told?\nI don't wonder you're angry. The books are in bad shape, and as some are\ninteresting it's a pity. I told Miss Hatchard they were suffering from\ndampness and lack of air; and I brought her here to show her how easily\nthe place could be ventilated. I also told her you ought to have some\none to help you do the dusting and airing. If you were given a wrong\nversion of what I said I'm sorry; but I'm so fond of old books that\nI'd rather see them made into a bonfire than left to moulder away like\nthese.”\n\nCharity felt her sobs rising and tried to stifle them in words. “I don't\ncare what you say you told her. All I know is she thinks it's all my\nfault, and I'm going to lose my job, and I wanted it more'n anyone in\nthe village, because I haven't got anybody belonging to me, the way\nother folks have. All I wanted was to put aside money enough to get away\nfrom here sometime. D'you suppose if it hadn't been for that I'd have\nkept on sitting day after day in this old vault?”\n\nOf this appeal her hearer took up only the last question. “It is an\nold vault; but need it be? That's the point. And it's my putting the\nquestion to my cousin that seems to have been the cause of the trouble.”\n His glance explored the melancholy penumbra of the long narrow room,\nresting on the blotched walls, the discoloured rows of books, and the\nstern rosewood desk surmounted by the portrait of the young Honorius.\n“Of course it's a bad job to do anything with a building jammed against\na hill like this ridiculous mausoleum: you couldn't get a good draught\nthrough it without blowing a hole in the mountain. But it can be\nventilated after a fashion, and the sun can be let in: I'll show you\nhow if you like....” The architect's passion for improvement had\nalready made him lose sight of her grievance, and he lifted his stick\ninstructively toward the cornice. But her silence seemed to tell him\nthat she took no interest in the ventilation of the library, and turning\nback to her abruptly he held out both hands. “Look here--you don't mean\nwhat you said? You don't really think I'd do anything to hurt you?”\n\nA new note in his voice disarmed her: no one had ever spoken to her in\nthat tone.\n\n“Oh, what DID you do it for then?” she wailed. He had her hands in\nhis, and she was feeling the smooth touch that she had imagined the day\nbefore on the hillside.\n\nHe pressed her hands lightly and let them go. “Why, to make things\npleasanter for you here; and better for the books. I'm sorry if my\ncousin twisted around what I said. She's excitable, and she lives on\ntrifles: I ought to have remembered that. Don't punish me by letting her\nthink you take her seriously.”\n\nIt was wonderful to hear him speak of Miss Hatchard as if she were a\nquerulous baby: in spite of his shyness he had the air of power that the\nexperience of cities probably gave. It was the fact of having lived\nin Nettleton that made lawyer Royall, in spite of his infirmities, the\nstrongest man in North Dormer; and Charity was sure that this young man\nhad lived in bigger places than Nettleton.\n\nShe felt that if she kept up her denunciatory tone he would secretly\nclass her with Miss Hatchard; and the thought made her suddenly simple.\n\n“It don't matter to Miss Hatchard how I take her. Mr. Royall says she's\ngoing to get a trained librarian; and I'd sooner resign than have the\nvillage say she sent me away.”\n\n“Naturally you would. But I'm sure she doesn't mean to send you away.\nAt any rate, won't you give me the chance to find out first and let you\nknow? It will be time enough to resign if I'm mistaken.”\n\nHer pride flamed into her cheeks at the suggestion of his intervening.\n“I don't want anybody should coax her to keep me if I don't suit.”\n\nHe coloured too. “I give you my word I won't do that. Only wait till\ntomorrow, will you?” He looked straight into her eyes with his shy grey\nglance. “You can trust me, you know--you really can.”\n\nAll the old frozen woes seemed to melt in her, and she murmured\nawkwardly, looking away from him: “Oh, I'll wait.”\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThere had never been such a June in Eagle County. Usually it was a month\nof moods, with abrupt alternations of belated frost and mid-summer heat;\nthis year, day followed day in a sequence of temperate beauty. Every\nmorning a breeze blew steadily from the hills. Toward noon it built up\ngreat canopies of white cloud that threw a cool shadow over fields and\nwoods; then before sunset the clouds dissolved again, and the western\nlight rained its unobstructed brightness on the valley.\n\nOn such an afternoon Charity Royall lay on a ridge above a sunlit\nhollow, her face pressed to the earth and the warm currents of the grass\nrunning through her. Directly in her line of vision a blackberry branch\nlaid its frail white flowers and blue-green leaves against the sky. Just\nbeyond, a tuft of sweet-fern uncurled between the beaded shoots of the\ngrass, and a small yellow butterfly vibrated over them like a fleck of\nsunshine. This was all she saw; but she felt, above her and about her,\nthe strong growth of the beeches clothing the ridge, the rounding of\npale green cones on countless spruce-branches, the push of myriads of\nsweet-fern fronds in the cracks of the stony slope below the wood,\nand the crowding shoots of meadowsweet and yellow flags in the pasture\nbeyond. All this bubbling of sap and slipping of sheaths and bursting of\ncalyxes was carried to her on mingled currents of fragrance. Every leaf\nand bud and blade seemed to contribute its exhalation to the pervading\nsweetness in which the pungency of pine-sap prevailed over the spice\nof thyme and the subtle perfume of fern, and all were merged in a moist\nearth-smell that was like the breath of some huge sun-warmed animal.\n\nCharity had lain there a long time, passive and sun-warmed as the slope\non which she lay, when there came between her eyes and the dancing\nbutterfly the sight of a man's foot in a large worn boot covered with\nred mud.\n\n“Oh, don't!” she exclaimed, raising herself on her elbow and stretching\nout a warning hand.\n\n“Don't what?” a hoarse voice asked above her head.\n\n“Don't stamp on those bramble flowers, you dolt!” she retorted,\nspringing to her knees. The foot paused and then descended clumsily on\nthe frail branch, and raising her eyes she saw above her the bewildered\nface of a slouching man with a thin sunburnt beard, and white arms\nshowing through his ragged shirt.\n\n“Don't you ever SEE anything, Liff Hyatt?” she assailed him, as he stood\nbefore her with the look of a man who has stirred up a wasp's nest.\n\nHe grinned. “I seen you! That's what I come down for.”\n\n“Down from where?” she questioned, stooping to gather up the petals his\nfoot had scattered.\n\nHe jerked his thumb toward the heights. “Been cutting down trees for Dan\nTargatt.”\n\nCharity sank back on her heels and looked at him musingly. She was\nnot in the least afraid of poor Liff Hyatt, though he “came from the\nMountain,” and some of the girls ran when they saw him. Among the more\nreasonable he passed for a harmless creature, a sort of link between the\nmountain and civilized folk, who occasionally came down and did a little\nwood cutting for a farmer when hands were short. Besides, she knew the\nMountain people would never hurt her: Liff himself had told her so\nonce when she was a little girl, and had met him one day at the edge\nof lawyer Royall's pasture. “They won't any of 'em touch you up there,\nf'ever you was to come up.... But I don't s'pose you will,” he had added\nphilosophically, looking at her new shoes, and at the red ribbon that\nMrs. Royall had tied in her hair.\n\nCharity had, in truth, never felt any desire to visit her birthplace.\nShe did not care to have it known that she was of the Mountain, and was\nshy of being seen in talk with Liff Hyatt. But today she was not sorry\nto have him appear. A great many things had happened to her since the\nday when young Lucius Harney had entered the doors of the Hatchard\nMemorial, but none, perhaps, so unforeseen as the fact of her suddenly\nfinding it a convenience to be on good terms with Liff Hyatt. She\ncontinued to look up curiously at his freckled weather-beaten face,\nwith feverish hollows below the cheekbones and the pale yellow eyes of\na harmless animal. “I wonder if he's related to me?” she thought, with a\nshiver of disdain.\n\n“Is there any folks living in the brown house by the swamp, up under\nPorcupine?” she presently asked in an indifferent tone.\n\nLiff Hyatt, for a while, considered her with surprise; then he scratched\nhis head and shifted his weight from one tattered sole to the other.\n\n“There's always the same folks in the brown house,” he said with his\nvague grin.\n\n“They're from up your way, ain't they?”\n\n“Their name's the same as mine,” he rejoined uncertainly.\n\nCharity still held him with resolute eyes. “See here, I want to go there\nsome day and take a gentleman with me that's boarding with us. He's up\nin these parts drawing pictures.”\n\nShe did not offer to explain this statement. It was too far beyond Liff\nHyatt's limitations for the attempt to be worth making. “He wants to see\nthe brown house, and go all over it,” she pursued.\n\nLiff was still running his fingers perplexedly through his shock of\nstraw-colored hair. “Is it a fellow from the city?” he asked.\n\n“Yes. He draws pictures of things. He's down there now drawing the\nBonner house.” She pointed to a chimney just visible over the dip of the\npasture below the wood.\n\n“The Bonner house?” Liff echoed incredulously.\n\n“Yes. You won't understand--and it don't matter. All I say is: he's\ngoing to the Hyatts' in a day or two.”\n\nLiff looked more and more perplexed. “Bash is ugly sometimes in the\nafternoons.”\n\nShe threw her head back, her eyes full on Hyatt's. “I'm coming too: you\ntell him.”\n\n“They won't none of them trouble you, the Hyatts won't. What d'you want\na take a stranger with you though?”\n\n“I've told you, haven't I? You've got to tell Bash Hyatt.”\n\nHe looked away at the blue mountains on the horizon; then his gaze\ndropped to the chimney-top below the pasture.\n\n“He's down there now?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe shifted his weight again, crossed his arms, and continued to survey\nthe distant landscape. “Well, so long,” he said at last, inconclusively;\nand turning away he shambled up the hillside. From the ledge above\nher, he paused to call down: “I wouldn't go there a Sunday”; then he\nclambered on till the trees closed in on him. Presently, from high\noverhead, Charity heard the ring of his axe.\n\nShe lay on the warm ridge, thinking of many things that the woodsman's\nappearance had stirred up in her. She knew nothing of her early life,\nand had never felt any curiosity about it: only a sullen reluctance to\nexplore the corner of her memory where certain blurred images lingered.\nBut all that had happened to her within the last few weeks had stirred\nher to the sleeping depths. She had become absorbingly interesting to\nherself, and everything that had to do with her past was illuminated by\nthis sudden curiosity.\n\nShe hated more than ever the fact of coming from the Mountain; but it\nwas no longer indifferent to her. Everything that in any way affected\nher was alive and vivid: even the hateful things had grown interesting\nbecause they were a part of herself.\n\n“I wonder if Liff Hyatt knows who my mother was?” she mused; and it\nfilled her with a tremor of surprise to think that some woman who was\nonce young and slight, with quick motions of the blood like hers, had\ncarried her in her breast, and watched her sleeping. She had always\nthought of her mother as so long dead as to be no more than a nameless\npinch of earth; but now it occurred to her that the once-young woman\nmight be alive, and wrinkled and elf-locked like the woman she had\nsometimes seen in the door of the brown house that Lucius Harney wanted\nto draw.\n\nThe thought brought him back to the central point in her mind, and\nshe strayed away from the conjectures roused by Liff Hyatt's presence.\nSpeculations concerning the past could not hold her long when the\npresent was so rich, the future so rosy, and when Lucius Harney,\na stone's throw away, was bending over his sketch-book, frowning,\ncalculating, measuring, and then throwing his head back with the sudden\nsmile that had shed its brightness over everything.\n\nShe scrambled to her feet, but as she did so she saw him coming up the\npasture and dropped down on the grass to wait. When he was drawing and\nmeasuring one of “his houses,” as she called them, she often strayed\naway by herself into the woods or up the hillside. It was partly from\nshyness that she did so: from a sense of inadequacy that came to her\nmost painfully when her companion, absorbed in his job, forgot her\nignorance and her inability to follow his least allusion, and plunged\ninto a monologue on art and life. To avoid the awkwardness of listening\nwith a blank face, and also to escape the surprised stare of the\ninhabitants of the houses before which he would abruptly pull up their\nhorse and open his sketch-book, she slipped away to some spot from\nwhich, without being seen, she could watch him at work, or at least look\ndown on the house he was drawing. She had not been displeased, at first,\nto have it known to North Dormer and the neighborhood that she was\ndriving Miss Hatchard's cousin about the country in the buggy he had\nhired of lawyer Royall. She had always kept to herself, contemptuously\naloof from village love-making, without exactly knowing whether her\nfierce pride was due to the sense of her tainted origin, or whether she\nwas reserving herself for a more brilliant fate. Sometimes she envied\nthe other girls their sentimental preoccupations, their long hours of\ninarticulate philandering with one of the few youths who still lingered\nin the village; but when she pictured herself curling her hair or\nputting a new ribbon on her hat for Ben Fry or one of the Sollas boys\nthe fever dropped and she relapsed into indifference.\n\nNow she knew the meaning of her disdains and reluctances. She had\nlearned what she was worth when Lucius Harney, looking at her for the\nfirst time, had lost the thread of his speech, and leaned reddening on\nthe edge of her desk. But another kind of shyness had been born in\nher: a terror of exposing to vulgar perils the sacred treasure of her\nhappiness. She was not sorry to have the neighbors suspect her of “going\nwith” a young man from the city; but she did not want it known to all\nthe countryside how many hours of the long June days she spent with him.\nWhat she most feared was that the inevitable comments should reach Mr.\nRoyall. Charity was instinctively aware that few things concerning her\nescaped the eyes of the silent man under whose roof she lived; and in\nspite of the latitude which North Dormer accorded to courting couples\nshe had always felt that, on the day when she showed too open a\npreference, Mr. Royall might, as she phrased it, make her “pay for\nit.” How, she did not know; and her fear was the greater because it\nwas undefinable. If she had been accepting the attentions of one of the\nvillage youths she would have been less apprehensive: Mr. Royall could\nnot prevent her marrying when she chose to. But everybody knew that\n“going with a city fellow” was a different and less straightforward\naffair: almost every village could show a victim of the perilous\nventure. And her dread of Mr. Royall's intervention gave a sharpened\njoy to the hours she spent with young Harney, and made her, at the same\ntime, shy of being too generally seen with him.\n\nAs he approached she rose to her knees, stretching her arms above her\nhead with the indolent gesture that was her way of expressing a profound\nwell-being.\n\n“I'm going to take you to that house up under Porcupine,” she announced.\n\n“What house? Oh, yes; that ramshackle place near the swamp, with the\ngipsy-looking people hanging about. It's curious that a house with\ntraces of real architecture should have been built in such a place. But\nthe people were a sulky-looking lot--do you suppose they'll let us in?”\n\n“They'll do whatever I tell them,” she said with assurance.\n\nHe threw himself down beside her. “Will they?” he rejoined with a smile.\n“Well, I should like to see what's left inside the house. And I should\nlike to have a talk with the people. Who was it who was telling me the\nother day that they had come down from the Mountain?”\n\nCharity shot a sideward look at him. It was the first time he had spoken\nof the Mountain except as a feature of the landscape. What else did he\nknow about it, and about her relation to it? Her heart began to beat\nwith the fierce impulse of resistance which she instinctively opposed to\nevery imagined slight.\n\n“The Mountain? I ain't afraid of the Mountain!”\n\nHer tone of defiance seemed to escape him. He lay breast-down on the\ngrass, breaking off sprigs of thyme and pressing them against his lips.\nFar off, above the folds of the nearer hills, the Mountain thrust itself\nup menacingly against a yellow sunset.\n\n“I must go up there some day: I want to see it,” he continued.\n\nHer heart-beats slackened and she turned again to examine his profile.\nIt was innocent of all unfriendly intention.\n\n“What'd you want to go up the Mountain for?”\n\n“Why, it must be rather a curious place. There's a queer colony up\nthere, you know: sort of out-laws, a little independent kingdom. Of\ncourse you've heard them spoken of; but I'm told they have nothing to\ndo with the people in the valleys--rather look down on them, in fact.\nI suppose they're rough customers; but they must have a good deal of\ncharacter.”\n\nShe did not quite know what he meant by having a good deal of character;\nbut his tone was expressive of admiration, and deepened her dawning\ncuriosity. It struck her now as strange that she knew so little about\nthe Mountain. She had never asked, and no one had ever offered to\nenlighten her. North Dormer took the Mountain for granted, and implied\nits disparagement by an intonation rather than by explicit criticism.\n\n“It's queer, you know,” he continued, “that, just over there, on top of\nthat hill, there should be a handful of people who don't give a damn for\nanybody.”\n\nThe words thrilled her. They seemed the clue to her own revolts and\ndefiances, and she longed to have him tell her more.\n\n“I don't know much about them. Have they always been there?”\n\n“Nobody seems to know exactly how long. Down at Creston they told me\nthat the first colonists are supposed to have been men who worked on the\nrailway that was built forty or fifty years ago between Springfield\nand Nettleton. Some of them took to drink, or got into trouble with the\npolice, and went off--disappeared into the woods. A year or two later\nthere was a report that they were living up on the Mountain. Then I\nsuppose others joined them--and children were born. Now they say there\nare over a hundred people up there. They seem to be quite outside the\njurisdiction of the valleys. No school, no church--and no sheriff ever\ngoes up to see what they're about. But don't people ever talk of them at\nNorth Dormer?”\n\n“I don't know. They say they're bad.”\n\nHe laughed. “Do they? We'll go and see, shall we?”\n\nShe flushed at the suggestion, and turned her face to his. “You never\nheard, I suppose--I come from there. They brought me down when I was\nlittle.”\n\n“You?” He raised himself on his elbow, looking at her with sudden\ninterest. “You're from the Mountain? How curious! I suppose that's why\nyou're so different....”\n\nHer happy blood bathed her to the forehead. He was praising her--and\npraising her because she came from the Mountain!\n\n“Am I... different?” she triumphed, with affected wonder.\n\n“Oh, awfully!” He picked up her hand and laid a kiss on the sunburnt\nknuckles.\n\n“Come,” he said, “let's be off.” He stood up and shook the grass from\nhis loose grey clothes. “What a good day! Where are you going to take me\ntomorrow?”\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nThat evening after supper Charity sat alone in the kitchen and listened\nto Mr. Royall and young Harney talking in the porch.\n\nShe had remained indoors after the table had been cleared and old Verena\nhad hobbled up to bed. The kitchen window was open, and Charity seated\nherself near it, her idle hands on her knee. The evening was cool and\nstill. Beyond the black hills an amber west passed into pale green,\nand then to a deep blue in which a great star hung. The soft hoot of a\nlittle owl came through the dusk, and between its calls the men's voices\nrose and fell.\n\nMr. Royall's was full of a sonorous satisfaction. It was a long time\nsince he had had anyone of Lucius Harney's quality to talk to: Charity\ndivined that the young man symbolized all his ruined and unforgotten\npast. When Miss Hatchard had been called to Springfield by the illness\nof a widowed sister, and young Harney, by that time seriously embarked\non his task of drawing and measuring all the old houses between\nNettleton and the New Hampshire border, had suggested the possibility of\nboarding at the red house in his cousin's absence, Charity had trembled\nlest Mr. Royall should refuse. There had been no question of lodging\nthe young man: there was no room for him. But it appeared that he could\nstill live at Miss Hatchard's if Mr. Royall would let him take his meals\nat the red house; and after a day's deliberation Mr. Royall consented.\n\nCharity suspected him of being glad of the chance to make a little\nmoney. He had the reputation of being an avaricious man; but she was\nbeginning to think he was probably poorer than people knew. His practice\nhad become little more than a vague legend, revived only at lengthening\nintervals by a summons to Hepburn or Nettleton; and he appeared to\ndepend for his living mainly on the scant produce of his farm, and\non the commissions received from the few insurance agencies that he\nrepresented in the neighbourhood. At any rate, he had been prompt in\naccepting Harney's offer to hire the buggy at a dollar and a half a\nday; and his satisfaction with the bargain had manifested itself,\nunexpectedly enough, at the end of the first week, by his tossing a\nten-dollar bill into Charity's lap as she sat one day retrimming her old\nhat.\n\n“Here--go get yourself a Sunday bonnet that'll make all the other girls\nmad,” he said, looking at her with a sheepish twinkle in his deep-set\neyes; and she immediately guessed that the unwonted present--the only\ngift of money she had ever received from him--represented Harney's first\npayment.\n\nBut the young man's coming had brought Mr. Royall other than\npecuniary benefit. It gave him, for the first time in years, a man's\ncompanionship. Charity had only a dim understanding of her guardian's\nneeds; but she knew he felt himself above the people among whom he\nlived, and she saw that Lucius Harney thought him so. She was surprised\nto find how well he seemed to talk now that he had a listener who\nunderstood him; and she was equally struck by young Harney's friendly\ndeference.\n\nTheir conversation was mostly about politics, and beyond her range; but\ntonight it had a peculiar interest for her, for they had begun to speak\nof the Mountain. She drew back a little, lest they should see she was in\nhearing.\n\n“The Mountain? The Mountain?” she heard Mr. Royall say. “Why, the\nMountain's a blot--that's what it is, sir, a blot. That scum up there\nought to have been run in long ago--and would have, if the people down\nhere hadn't been clean scared of them. The Mountain belongs to this\ntownship, and it's North Dormer's fault if there's a gang of thieves\nand outlaws living over there, in sight of us, defying the laws of their\ncountry. Why, there ain't a sheriff or a tax-collector or a coroner'd\ndurst go up there. When they hear of trouble on the Mountain the\nselectmen look the other way, and pass an appropriation to beautify the\ntown pump. The only man that ever goes up is the minister, and he goes\nbecause they send down and get him whenever there's any of them dies.\nThey think a lot of Christian burial on the Mountain--but I never heard\nof their having the minister up to marry them. And they never trouble\nthe Justice of the Peace either. They just herd together like the\nheathen.”\n\nHe went on, explaining in somewhat technical language how the little\ncolony of squatters had contrived to keep the law at bay, and Charity,\nwith burning eagerness, awaited young Harney's comment; but the young\nman seemed more concerned to hear Mr. Royall's views than to express his\nown.\n\n“I suppose you've never been up there yourself?” he presently asked.\n\n“Yes, I have,” said Mr. Royall with a contemptuous laugh. “The wiseacres\ndown here told me I'd be done for before I got back; but nobody lifted a\nfinger to hurt me. And I'd just had one of their gang sent up for seven\nyears too.”\n\n“You went up after that?”\n\n“Yes, sir: right after it. The fellow came down to Nettleton and ran\namuck, the way they sometimes do. After they've done a wood-cutting\njob they come down and blow the money in; and this man ended up with\nmanslaughter. I got him convicted, though they were scared of the\nMountain even at Nettleton; and then a queer thing happened. The fellow\nsent for me to go and see him in gaol. I went, and this is what he says:\n'The fool that defended me is a chicken-livered son of a--and all\nthe rest of it,' he says. 'I've got a job to be done for me up on the\nMountain, and you're the only man I seen in court that looks as if he'd\ndo it.' He told me he had a child up there--or thought he had--a little\ngirl; and he wanted her brought down and reared like a Christian. I was\nsorry for the fellow, so I went up and got the child.” He paused, and\nCharity listened with a throbbing heart. “That's the only time I ever\nwent up the Mountain,” he concluded.\n\nThere was a moment's silence; then Harney spoke. “And the child--had she\nno mother?”\n\n“Oh, yes: there was a mother. But she was glad enough to have her go.\nShe'd have given her to anybody. They ain't half human up there. I guess\nthe mother's dead by now, with the life she was leading. Anyhow, I've\nnever heard of her from that day to this.”\n\n“My God, how ghastly,” Harney murmured; and Charity, choking with\nhumiliation, sprang to her feet and ran upstairs. She knew at last: knew\nthat she was the child of a drunken convict and of a mother who wasn't\n“half human,” and was glad to have her go; and she had heard this\nhistory of her origin related to the one being in whose eyes she longed\nto appear superior to the people about her! She had noticed that Mr.\nRoyall had not named her, had even avoided any allusion that might\nidentify her with the child he had brought down from the Mountain; and\nshe knew it was out of regard for her that he had kept silent. But\nof what use was his discretion, since only that afternoon, misled by\nHarney's interest in the out-law colony, she had boasted to him of\ncoming from the Mountain? Now every word that had been spoken showed her\nhow such an origin must widen the distance between them.\n\nDuring his ten days' sojourn at North Dormer Lucius Harney had not\nspoken a word of love to her. He had intervened in her behalf with his\ncousin, and had convinced Miss Hatchard of her merits as a librarian;\nbut that was a simple act of justice, since it was by his own fault that\nthose merits had been questioned. He had asked her to drive him about\nthe country when he hired lawyer Royall's buggy to go on his sketching\nexpeditions; but that too was natural enough, since he was unfamiliar\nwith the region. Lastly, when his cousin was called to Springfield, he\nhad begged Mr. Royall to receive him as a boarder; but where else in\nNorth Dormer could he have boarded? Not with Carrick Fry, whose wife was\nparalysed, and whose large family crowded his table to over-flowing; not\nwith the Targatts, who lived a mile up the road, nor with poor old Mrs.\nHawes, who, since her eldest daughter had deserted her, barely had the\nstrength to cook her own meals while Ally picked up her living as a\nseamstress. Mr. Royall's was the only house where the young man\ncould have been offered a decent hospitality. There had been nothing,\ntherefore, in the outward course of events to raise in Charity's breast\nthe hopes with which it trembled. But beneath the visible incidents\nresulting from Lucius Harney's arrival there ran an undercurrent as\nmysterious and potent as the influence that makes the forest break into\nleaf before the ice is off the pools.\n\nThe business on which Harney had come was authentic; Charity had seen\nthe letter from a New York publisher commissioning him to make a study\nof the eighteenth century houses in the less familiar districts of New\nEngland. But incomprehensible as the whole affair was to her, and hard\nas she found it to understand why he paused enchanted before certain\nneglected and paintless houses, while others, refurbished and “improved”\n by the local builder, did not arrest a glance, she could not but suspect\nthat Eagle County was less rich in architecture than he averred, and\nthat the duration of his stay (which he had fixed at a month) was not\nunconnected with the look in his eyes when he had first paused before\nher in the library. Everything that had followed seemed to have grown\nout of that look: his way of speaking to her, his quickness in catching\nher meaning, his evident eagerness to prolong their excursions and to\nseize on every chance of being with her.\n\nThe signs of his liking were manifest enough; but it was hard to guess\nhow much they meant, because his manner was so different from anything\nNorth Dormer had ever shown her. He was at once simpler and more\ndeferential than any one she had known; and sometimes it was just when\nhe was simplest that she most felt the distance between them. Education\nand opportunity had divided them by a width that no effort of hers could\nbridge, and even when his youth and his admiration brought him nearest,\nsome chance word, some unconscious allusion, seemed to thrust her back\nacross the gulf.\n\nNever had it yawned so wide as when she fled up to her room carrying\nwith her the echo of Mr. Royall's tale. Her first confused thought\nwas the prayer that she might never see young Harney again. It was\ntoo bitter to picture him as the detached impartial listener to such\na story. “I wish he'd go away: I wish he'd go tomorrow, and never come\nback!” she moaned to her pillow; and far into the night she lay there,\nin the disordered dress she had forgotten to take off, her whole soul\na tossing misery on which her hopes and dreams spun about like drowning\nstraws.\n\nOf all this tumult only a vague heart-soreness was left when she opened\nher eyes the next morning. Her first thought was of the weather, for\nHarney had asked her to take him to the brown house under Porcupine,\nand then around by Hamblin; and as the trip was a long one they were to\nstart at nine. The sun rose without a cloud, and earlier than usual she\nwas in the kitchen, making cheese sandwiches, decanting buttermilk into\na bottle, wrapping up slices of apple pie, and accusing Verena of having\ngiven away a basket she needed, which had always hung on a hook in the\npassage. When she came out into the porch, in her pink calico, which had\nrun a little in the washing, but was still bright enough to set off\nher dark tints, she had such a triumphant sense of being a part of the\nsunlight and the morning that the last trace of her misery vanished.\nWhat did it matter where she came from, or whose child she was, when\nlove was dancing in her veins, and down the road she saw young Harney\ncoming toward her?\n\nMr. Royall was in the porch too. He had said nothing at breakfast, but\nwhen she came out in her pink dress, the basket in her hand, he looked\nat her with surprise. “Where you going to?” he asked.\n\n“Why--Mr. Harney's starting earlier than usual today,” she answered.\n\n“Mr. Harney, Mr. Harney? Ain't Mr. Harney learned how to drive a horse\nyet?”\n\nShe made no answer, and he sat tilted back in his chair, drumming on the\nrail of the porch. It was the first time he had ever spoken of the young\nman in that tone, and Charity felt a faint chill of apprehension. After\na moment he stood up and walked away toward the bit of ground behind the\nhouse, where the hired man was hoeing.\n\nThe air was cool and clear, with the autumnal sparkle that a north wind\nbrings to the hills in early summer, and the night had been so still\nthat the dew hung on everything, not as a lingering moisture, but in\nseparate beads that glittered like diamonds on the ferns and grasses. It\nwas a long drive to the foot of Porcupine: first across the valley, with\nblue hills bounding the open slopes; then down into the beech-woods,\nfollowing the course of the Creston, a brown brook leaping over velvet\nledges; then out again onto the farm-lands about Creston Lake, and\ngradually up the ridges of the Eagle Range. At last they reached the\nyoke of the hills, and before them opened another valley, green and\nwild, and beyond it more blue heights eddying away to the sky like the\nwaves of a receding tide.\n\nHarney tied the horse to a tree-stump, and they unpacked their basket\nunder an aged walnut with a riven trunk out of which bumblebees darted.\nThe sun had grown hot, and behind them was the noonday murmur of\nthe forest. Summer insects danced on the air, and a flock of white\nbutterflies fanned the mobile tips of the crimson fireweed. In the\nvalley below not a house was visible; it seemed as if Charity Royall and\nyoung Harney were the only living beings in the great hollow of earth\nand sky.\n\nCharity's spirits flagged and disquieting thoughts stole back on her.\nYoung Harney had grown silent, and as he lay beside her, his arms under\nhis head, his eyes on the network of leaves above him, she wondered if\nhe were musing on what Mr. Royall had told him, and if it had really\ndebased her in his thoughts. She wished he had not asked her to take him\nthat day to the brown house; she did not want him to see the people she\ncame from while the story of her birth was fresh in his mind. More than\nonce she had been on the point of suggesting that they should follow the\nridge and drive straight to Hamblin, where there was a little deserted\nhouse he wanted to see; but shyness and pride held her back. “He'd\nbetter know what kind of folks I belong to,” she said to herself, with\na somewhat forced defiance; for in reality it was shame that kept her\nsilent.\n\nSuddenly she lifted her hand and pointed to the sky. “There's a storm\ncoming up.”\n\nHe followed her glance and smiled. “Is it that scrap of cloud among the\npines that frightens you?”\n\n“It's over the Mountain; and a cloud over the Mountain always means\ntrouble.”\n\n“Oh, I don't believe half the bad things you all say of the Mountain!\nBut anyhow, we'll get down to the brown house before the rain comes.”\n\nHe was not far wrong, for only a few isolated drops had fallen when they\nturned into the road under the shaggy flank of Porcupine, and came\nupon the brown house. It stood alone beside a swamp bordered with alder\nthickets and tall bulrushes. Not another dwelling was in sight, and it\nwas hard to guess what motive could have actuated the early settler who\nhad made his home in so unfriendly a spot.\n\nCharity had picked up enough of her companion's erudition to understand\nwhat had attracted him to the house. She noticed the fan-shaped tracery\nof the broken light above the door, the flutings of the paintless\npilasters at the corners, and the round window set in the gable; and she\nknew that, for reasons that still escaped her, these were things to\nbe admired and recorded. Still, they had seen other houses far more\n“typical” (the word was Harney's); and as he threw the reins on the\nhorse's neck he said with a slight shiver of repugnance: “We won't stay\nlong.”\n\nAgainst the restless alders turning their white lining to the storm the\nhouse looked singularly desolate. The paint was almost gone from the\nclap-boards, the window-panes were broken and patched with rags, and the\ngarden was a poisonous tangle of nettles, burdocks and tall swamp-weeds\nover which big blue-bottles hummed.\n\nAt the sound of wheels a child with a tow-head and pale eyes like Liff\nHyatt's peered over the fence and then slipped away behind an out-house.\nHarney jumped down and helped Charity out; and as he did so the rain\nbroke on them. It came slant-wise, on a furious gale, laying shrubs and\nyoung trees flat, tearing off their leaves like an autumn storm, turning\nthe road into a river, and making hissing pools of every hollow. Thunder\nrolled incessantly through the roar of the rain, and a strange glitter\nof light ran along the ground under the increasing blackness.\n\n“Lucky we're here after all,” Harney laughed. He fastened the horse\nunder a half-roofless shed, and wrapping Charity in his coat ran with\nher to the house. The boy had not reappeared, and as there was no\nresponse to their knocks Harney turned the door-handle and they went in.\n\nThere were three people in the kitchen to which the door admitted\nthem. An old woman with a handkerchief over her head was sitting by the\nwindow. She held a sickly-looking kitten on her knees, and whenever\nit jumped down and tried to limp away she stooped and lifted it back\nwithout any change of her aged, unnoticing face. Another woman, the\nunkempt creature that Charity had once noticed in driving by, stood\nleaning against the window-frame and stared at them; and near the stove\nan unshaved man in a tattered shirt sat on a barrel asleep.\n\nThe place was bare and miserable and the air heavy with the smell of\ndirt and stale tobacco. Charity's heart sank. Old derided tales of\nthe Mountain people came back to her, and the woman's stare was so\ndisconcerting, and the face of the sleeping man so sodden and bestial,\nthat her disgust was tinged with a vague dread. She was not afraid for\nherself; she knew the Hyatts would not be likely to trouble her; but she\nwas not sure how they would treat a “city fellow.”\n\nLucius Harney would certainly have laughed at her fears. He glanced\nabout the room, uttered a general “How are you?” to which no one\nresponded, and then asked the younger woman if they might take shelter\ntill the storm was over.\n\nShe turned her eyes away from him and looked at Charity.\n\n“You're the girl from Royall's, ain't you?”\n\nThe colour rose in Charity's face. “I'm Charity Royall,” she said, as\nif asserting her right to the name in the very place where it might have\nbeen most open to question.\n\nThe woman did not seem to notice. “You kin stay,” she merely said;\nthen she turned away and stooped over a dish in which she was stirring\nsomething.\n\nHarney and Charity sat down on a bench made of a board resting on two\nstarch boxes. They faced a door hanging on a broken hinge, and through\nthe crack they saw the eyes of the tow-headed boy and of a pale little\ngirl with a scar across her cheek. Charity smiled, and signed to the\nchildren to come in; but as soon as they saw they were discovered they\nslipped away on bare feet. It occurred to her that they were afraid of\nrousing the sleeping man; and probably the woman shared their fear, for\nshe moved about as noiselessly and avoided going near the stove.\n\nThe rain continued to beat against the house, and in one or two places\nit sent a stream through the patched panes and ran into pools on the\nfloor. Every now and then the kitten mewed and struggled down, and the\nold woman stooped and caught it, holding it tight in her bony hands; and\nonce or twice the man on the barrel half woke, changed his position\nand dozed again, his head falling forward on his hairy breast. As the\nminutes passed, and the rain still streamed against the windows, a\nloathing of the place and the people came over Charity. The sight of\nthe weak-minded old woman, of the cowed children, and the ragged man\nsleeping off his liquor, made the setting of her own life seem a vision\nof peace and plenty. She thought of the kitchen at Mr. Royall's, with\nits scrubbed floor and dresser full of china, and the peculiar smell of\nyeast and coffee and soft-soap that she had always hated, but that now\nseemed the very symbol of household order. She saw Mr. Royall's room,\nwith the high-backed horsehair chair, the faded rag carpet, the row of\nbooks on a shelf, the engraving of “The Surrender of Burgoyne” over\nthe stove, and the mat with a brown and white spaniel on a moss-green\nborder. And then her mind travelled to Miss Hatchard's house, where all\nwas freshness, purity and fragrance, and compared to which the red house\nhad always seemed so poor and plain.\n\n“This is where I belong--this is where I belong,” she kept repeating to\nherself; but the words had no meaning for her. Every instinct and habit\nmade her a stranger among these poor swamp-people living like vermin in\ntheir lair. With all her soul she wished she had not yielded to Harney's\ncuriosity, and brought him there.\n\nThe rain had drenched her, and she began to shiver under the thin folds\nof her dress. The younger woman must have noticed it, for she went out\nof the room and came back with a broken tea-cup which she offered to\nCharity. It was half full of whiskey, and Charity shook her head; but\nHarney took the cup and put his lips to it. When he had set it down\nCharity saw him feel in his pocket and draw out a dollar; he hesitated\na moment, and then put it back, and she guessed that he did not wish her\nto see him offering money to people she had spoken of as being her kin.\n\nThe sleeping man stirred, lifted his head and opened his eyes. They\nrested vacantly for a moment on Charity and Harney, and then closed\nagain, and his head drooped; but a look of anxiety came into the woman's\nface. She glanced out of the window and then came up to Harney. “I guess\nyou better go along now,” she said. The young man understood and got to\nhis feet. “Thank you,” he said, holding out his hand. She seemed not to\nnotice the gesture, and turned away as they opened the door.\n\nThe rain was still coming down, but they hardly noticed it: the pure air\nwas like balm in their faces. The clouds were rising and breaking, and\nbetween their edges the light streamed down from remote blue hollows.\nHarney untied the horse, and they drove off through the diminishing\nrain, which was already beaded with sunlight.\n\nFor a while Charity was silent, and her companion did not speak. She\nlooked timidly at his profile: it was graver than usual, as though he\ntoo were oppressed by what they had seen. Then she broke out abruptly:\n“Those people back there are the kind of folks I come from. They may be\nmy relations, for all I know.” She did not want him to think that she\nregretted having told him her story.\n\n“Poor creatures,” he rejoined. “I wonder why they came down to that\nfever-hole.”\n\nShe laughed ironically. “To better themselves! It's worse up on the\nMountain. Bash Hyatt married the daughter of the farmer that used to own\nthe brown house. That was him by the stove, I suppose.”\n\nHarney seemed to find nothing to say and she went on: “I saw you take\nout a dollar to give to that poor woman. Why did you put it back?”\n\nHe reddened, and leaned forward to flick a swamp-fly from the horse's\nneck. “I wasn't sure----”\n\n“Was it because you knew they were my folks, and thought I'd be ashamed\nto see you give them money?”\n\nHe turned to her with eyes full of reproach. “Oh, Charity----” It was\nthe first time he had ever called her by her name. Her misery welled\nover.\n\n“I ain't--I ain't ashamed. They're my people, and I ain't ashamed of\nthem,” she sobbed.\n\n“My dear...” he murmured, putting his arm about her; and she leaned\nagainst him and wept out her pain.\n\nIt was too late to go around to Hamblin, and all the stars were out in a\nclear sky when they reached the North Dormer valley and drove up to the\nred house.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nSINCE her reinstatement in Miss Hatchard's favour Charity had not dared\nto curtail by a moment her hours of attendance at the library. She\neven made a point of arriving before the time, and showed a laudable\nindignation when the youngest Targatt girl, who had been engaged to help\nin the cleaning and rearranging of the books, came trailing in late\nand neglected her task to peer through the window at the Sollas boy.\nNevertheless, “library days” seemed more than ever irksome to Charity\nafter her vivid hours of liberty; and she would have found it hard to\nset a good example to her subordinate if Lucius Harney had not been\ncommissioned, before Miss Hatchard's departure, to examine with the\nlocal carpenter the best means of ventilating the “Memorial.”\n\nHe was careful to prosecute this inquiry on the days when the library\nwas open to the public; and Charity was therefore sure of spending part\nof the afternoon in his company. The Targatt girl's presence, and the\nrisk of being interrupted by some passer-by suddenly smitten with a\nthirst for letters, restricted their intercourse to the exchange of\ncommonplaces; but there was a fascination to Charity in the contrast\nbetween these public civilities and their secret intimacy.\n\nThe day after their drive to the brown house was “library day,” and\nshe sat at her desk working at the revised catalogue, while the Targatt\ngirl, one eye on the window, chanted out the titles of a pile of books.\nCharity's thoughts were far away, in the dismal house by the swamp, and\nunder the twilight sky during the long drive home, when Lucius Harney\nhad consoled her with endearing words. That day, for the first time\nsince he had been boarding with them, he had failed to appear as usual\nat the midday meal. No message had come to explain his absence, and Mr.\nRoyall, who was more than usually taciturn, had betrayed no surprise,\nand made no comment. In itself this indifference was not particularly\nsignificant, for Mr. Royall, in common with most of his fellow-citizens,\nhad a way of accepting events passively, as if he had long since come\nto the conclusion that no one who lived in North Dormer could hope to\nmodify them. But to Charity, in the reaction from her mood of passionate\nexaltation, there was something disquieting in his silence. It was\nalmost as if Lucius Harney had never had a part in their lives: Mr.\nRoyall's imperturbable indifference seemed to relegate him to the domain\nof unreality.\n\nAs she sat at work, she tried to shake off her disappointment at\nHarney's non-appearing. Some trifling incident had probably kept him\nfrom joining them at midday; but she was sure he must be eager to see\nher again, and that he would not want to wait till they met at supper,\nbetween Mr. Royall and Verena. She was wondering what his first words\nwould be, and trying to devise a way of getting rid of the Targatt girl\nbefore he came, when she heard steps outside, and he walked up the path\nwith Mr. Miles.\n\nThe clergyman from Hepburn seldom came to North Dormer except when he\ndrove over to officiate at the old white church which, by an unusual\nchance, happened to belong to the Episcopal communion. He was a brisk\naffable man, eager to make the most of the fact that a little nucleus of\n“church-people” had survived in the sectarian wilderness, and resolved\nto undermine the influence of the ginger-bread-coloured Baptist chapel\nat the other end of the village; but he was kept busy by parochial work\nat Hepburn, where there were paper-mills and saloons, and it was not\noften that he could spare time for North Dormer.\n\nCharity, who went to the white church (like all the best people in North\nDormer), admired Mr. Miles, and had even, during the memorable trip to\nNettleton, imagined herself married to a man who had such a straight\nnose and such a beautiful way of speaking, and who lived in a\nbrown-stone rectory covered with Virginia creeper. It had been a shock\nto discover that the privilege was already enjoyed by a lady with\ncrimped hair and a large baby; but the arrival of Lucius Harney had long\nsince banished Mr. Miles from Charity's dreams, and as he walked up the\npath at Harney's side she saw him as he really was: a fat middle-aged\nman with a baldness showing under his clerical hat, and spectacles on\nhis Grecian nose. She wondered what had called him to North Dormer on a\nweekday, and felt a little hurt that Harney should have brought him to\nthe library.\n\nIt presently appeared that his presence there was due to Miss Hatchard.\nHe had been spending a few days at Springfield, to fill a friend's\npulpit, and had been consulted by Miss Hatchard as to young Harney's\nplan for ventilating the “Memorial.” To lay hands on the Hatchard ark\nwas a grave matter, and Miss Hatchard, always full of scruples about her\nscruples (it was Harney's phrase), wished to have Mr. Miles's opinion\nbefore deciding.\n\n“I couldn't,” Mr. Miles explained, “quite make out from your cousin what\nchanges you wanted to make, and as the other trustees did not understand\neither I thought I had better drive over and take a look--though I'm\nsure,” he added, turning his friendly spectacles on the young man, “that\nno one could be more competent--but of course this spot has its peculiar\nsanctity!”\n\n“I hope a little fresh air won't desecrate it,” Harney laughingly\nrejoined; and they walked to the other end of the library while he set\nforth his idea to the Rector.\n\nMr. Miles had greeted the two girls with his usual friendliness, but\nCharity saw that he was occupied with other things, and she presently\nbecame aware, by the scraps of conversation drifting over to her, that\nhe was still under the charm of his visit to Springfield, which appeared\nto have been full of agreeable incidents.\n\n“Ah, the Coopersons... yes, you know them, of course,” she heard. “That's\na fine old house! And Ned Cooperson has collected some really remarkable\nimpressionist pictures....” The names he cited were unknown to Charity.\n“Yes; yes; the Schaefer quartette played at Lyric Hall on Saturday\nevening; and on Monday I had the privilege of hearing them again at the\nTowers. Beautifully done... Bach and Beethoven... a lawn-party\nfirst... I saw Miss Balch several times, by the way... looking extremely\nhandsome....”\n\nCharity dropped her pencil and forgot to listen to the Targatt girl's\nsing-song. Why had Mr. Miles suddenly brought up Annabel Balch's name?\n\n“Oh, really?” she heard Harney rejoin; and, raising his stick, he\npursued: “You see, my plan is to move these shelves away, and open a\nround window in this wall, on the axis of the one under the pediment.”\n\n“I suppose she'll be coming up here later to stay with Miss Hatchard?”\n Mr. Miles went on, following on his train of thought; then, spinning\nabout and tilting his head back: “Yes, yes, I see--I understand: that\nwill give a draught without materially altering the look of things. I\ncan see no objection.”\n\nThe discussion went on for some minutes, and gradually the two men moved\nback toward the desk. Mr. Miles stopped again and looked thoughtfully at\nCharity. “Aren't you a little pale, my dear? Not overworking? Mr. Harney\ntells me you and Mamie are giving the library a thorough overhauling.”\n He was always careful to remember his parishioners' Christian names,\nand at the right moment he bent his benignant spectacles on the Targatt\ngirl.\n\nThen he turned to Charity. “Don't take things hard, my dear; don't take\nthings hard. Come down and see Mrs. Miles and me some day at Hepburn,”\n he said, pressing her hand and waving a farewell to Mamie Targatt. He\nwent out of the library, and Harney followed him.\n\nCharity thought she detected a look of constraint in Harney's eyes. She\nfancied he did not want to be alone with her; and with a sudden pang she\nwondered if he repented the tender things he had said to her the night\nbefore. His words had been more fraternal than lover-like; but she had\nlost their exact sense in the caressing warmth of his voice. He had made\nher feel that the fact of her being a waif from the Mountain was only\nanother reason for holding her close and soothing her with consolatory\nmurmurs; and when the drive was over, and she got out of the buggy,\ntired, cold, and aching with emotion, she stepped as if the ground were\na sunlit wave and she the spray on its crest.\n\nWhy, then, had his manner suddenly changed, and why did he leave the\nlibrary with Mr. Miles? Her restless imagination fastened on the name\nof Annabel Balch: from the moment it had been mentioned she fancied\nthat Harney's expression had altered. Annabel Balch at a garden-party at\nSpringfield, looking “extremely handsome”... perhaps Mr. Miles had seen\nher there at the very moment when Charity and Harney were sitting in the\nHyatts' hovel, between a drunkard and a half-witted old woman! Charity\ndid not know exactly what a garden-party was, but her glimpse of the\nflower-edged lawns of Nettleton helped her to visualize the scene, and\nenvious recollections of the “old things” which Miss Balch avowedly\n“wore out” when she came to North Dormer made it only too easy to\npicture her in her splendour. Charity understood what associations the\nname must have called up, and felt the uselessness of struggling against\nthe unseen influences in Harney's life.\n\nWhen she came down from her room for supper he was not there; and while\nshe waited in the porch she recalled the tone in which Mr. Royall had\ncommented the day before on their early start. Mr. Royall sat at her\nside, his chair tilted back, his broad black boots with side-elastics\nresting against the lower bar of the railings. His rumpled grey hair\nstood up above his forehead like the crest of an angry bird, and the\nleather-brown of his veined cheeks was blotched with red. Charity knew\nthat those red spots were the signs of a coming explosion.\n\nSuddenly he said: “Where's supper? Has Verena Marsh slipped up again on\nher soda-biscuits?”\n\nCharity threw a startled glance at him. “I presume she's waiting for Mr.\nHarney.”\n\n“Mr. Harney, is she? She'd better dish up, then. He ain't coming.” He\nstood up, walked to the door, and called out, in the pitch necessary to\npenetrate the old woman's tympanum: “Get along with the supper, Verena.”\n\nCharity was trembling with apprehension. Something had happened--she was\nsure of it now--and Mr. Royall knew what it was. But not for the world\nwould she have gratified him by showing her anxiety. She took her usual\nplace, and he seated himself opposite, and poured out a strong cup of\ntea before passing her the tea-pot. Verena brought some scrambled eggs,\nand he piled his plate with them. “Ain't you going to take any?” he\nasked. Charity roused herself and began to eat.\n\nThe tone with which Mr. Royall had said “He's not coming” seemed to her\nfull of an ominous satisfaction. She saw that he had suddenly begun to\nhate Lucius Harney, and guessed herself to be the cause of this change\nof feeling. But she had no means of finding out whether some act of\nhostility on his part had made the young man stay away, or whether he\nsimply wished to avoid seeing her again after their drive back from the\nbrown house. She ate her supper with a studied show of indifference, but\nshe knew that Mr. Royall was watching her and that her agitation did not\nescape him.\n\nAfter supper she went up to her room. She heard Mr. Royall cross the\npassage, and presently the sounds below her window showed that he\nhad returned to the porch. She seated herself on her bed and began to\nstruggle against the desire to go down and ask him what had happened.\n“I'd rather die than do it,” she muttered to herself. With a word he\ncould have relieved her uncertainty: but never would she gratify him by\nsaying it.\n\nShe rose and leaned out of the window. The twilight had deepened into\nnight, and she watched the frail curve of the young moon dropping to\nthe edge of the hills. Through the darkness she saw one or two figures\nmoving down the road; but the evening was too cold for loitering, and\npresently the strollers disappeared. Lamps were beginning to show here\nand there in the windows. A bar of light brought out the whiteness of a\nclump of lilies in the Hawes's yard: and farther down the street Carrick\nFry's Rochester lamp cast its bold illumination on the rustic flower-tub\nin the middle of his grass-plot.\n\nFor a long time she continued to lean in the window. But a fever of\nunrest consumed her, and finally she went downstairs, took her hat\nfrom its hook, and swung out of the house. Mr. Royall sat in the porch,\nVerena beside him, her old hands crossed on her patched skirt. As\nCharity went down the steps Mr. Royall called after her: “Where you\ngoing?” She could easily have answered: “To Orma's,” or “Down to the\nTargatts'”; and either answer might have been true, for she had no\npurpose. But she swept on in silence, determined not to recognize his\nright to question her.\n\nAt the gate she paused and looked up and down the road. The darkness\ndrew her, and she thought of climbing the hill and plunging into\nthe depths of the larch-wood above the pasture. Then she glanced\nirresolutely along the street, and as she did so a gleam appeared\nthrough the spruces at Miss Hatchard's gate. Lucius Harney was there,\nthen--he had not gone down to Hepburn with Mr. Miles, as she had at\nfirst imagined. But where had he taken his evening meal, and what had\ncaused him to stay away from Mr. Royall's? The light was positive proof\nof his presence, for Miss Hatchard's servants were away on a holiday,\nand her farmer's wife came only in the mornings, to make the young man's\nbed and prepare his coffee. Beside that lamp he was doubtless sitting at\nthis moment. To know the truth Charity had only to walk half the length\nof the village, and knock at the lighted window. She hesitated a minute\nor two longer, and then turned toward Miss Hatchard's.\n\nShe walked quickly, straining her eyes to detect anyone who might be\ncoming along the street; and before reaching the Frys' she crossed over\nto avoid the light from their window. Whenever she was unhappy she\nfelt herself at bay against a pitiless world, and a kind of animal\nsecretiveness possessed her. But the street was empty, and she passed\nunnoticed through the gate and up the path to the house. Its white front\nglimmered indistinctly through the trees, showing only one oblong of\nlight on the lower floor. She had supposed that the lamp was in Miss\nHatchard's sitting-room; but she now saw that it shone through a window\nat the farther corner of the house. She did not know the room to which\nthis window belonged, and she paused under the trees, checked by a sense\nof strangeness. Then she moved on, treading softly on the short grass,\nand keeping so close to the house that whoever was in the room, even if\nroused by her approach, would not be able to see her.\n\nThe window opened on a narrow verandah with a trellised arch. She leaned\nclose to the trellis, and parting the sprays of clematis that covered it\nlooked into a corner of the room. She saw the foot of a mahogany bed,\nan engraving on the wall, a wash-stand on which a towel had been tossed,\nand one end of the green-covered table which held the lamp. Half of\nthe lampshade projected into her field of vision, and just under it two\nsmooth sunburnt hands, one holding a pencil and the other a ruler, were\nmoving to and fro over a drawing-board.\n\nHer heart jumped and then stood still. He was there, a few feet away;\nand while her soul was tossing on seas of woe he had been quietly\nsitting at his drawing-board. The sight of those two hands, moving with\ntheir usual skill and precision, woke her out of her dream. Her eyes\nwere opened to the disproportion between what she had felt and the cause\nof her agitation; and she was turning away from the window when one hand\nabruptly pushed aside the drawing-board and the other flung down the\npencil.\n\nCharity had often noticed Harney's loving care of his drawings, and the\nneatness and method with which he carried on and concluded each task.\nThe impatient sweeping aside of the drawing-board seemed to reveal a new\nmood. The gesture suggested sudden discouragement, or distaste for his\nwork and she wondered if he too were agitated by secret perplexities.\nHer impulse of flight was checked; she stepped up on the verandah and\nlooked into the room.\n\nHarney had put his elbows on the table and was resting his chin on his\nlocked hands. He had taken off his coat and waistcoat, and unbuttoned\nthe low collar of his flannel shirt; she saw the vigorous lines of his\nyoung throat, and the root of the muscles where they joined the\nchest. He sat staring straight ahead of him, a look of weariness and\nself-disgust on his face: it was almost as if he had been gazing at a\ndistorted reflection of his own features. For a moment Charity looked at\nhim with a kind of terror, as if he had been a stranger under familiar\nlineaments; then she glanced past him and saw on the floor an open\nportmanteau half full of clothes. She understood that he was preparing\nto leave, and that he had probably decided to go without seeing her. She\nsaw that the decision, from whatever cause it was taken, had disturbed\nhim deeply; and she immediately concluded that his change of plan was\ndue to some surreptitious interference of Mr. Royall's. All her old\nresentments and rebellions flamed up, confusedly mingled with the\nyearning roused by Harney's nearness. Only a few hours earlier she\nhad felt secure in his comprehending pity; now she was flung back on\nherself, doubly alone after that moment of communion.\n\nHarney was still unaware of her presence. He sat without moving, moodily\nstaring before him at the same spot in the wall-paper. He had not even\nhad the energy to finish his packing, and his clothes and papers lay on\nthe floor about the portmanteau. Presently he unlocked his clasped hands\nand stood up; and Charity, drawing back hastily, sank down on the step\nof the verandah. The night was so dark that there was not much chance\nof his seeing her unless he opened the window and before that she would\nhave time to slip away and be lost in the shadow of the trees. He stood\nfor a minute or two looking around the room with the same expression of\nself-disgust, as if he hated himself and everything about him; then\nhe sat down again at the table, drew a few more strokes, and threw\nhis pencil aside. Finally he walked across the floor, kicking the\nportmanteau out of his way, and lay down on the bed, folding his arms\nunder his head, and staring up morosely at the ceiling. Just so, Charity\nhad seen him at her side on the grass or the pine-needles, his eyes\nfixed on the sky, and pleasure flashing over his face like the flickers\nof sun the branches shed on it. But now the face was so changed that she\nhardly knew it; and grief at his grief gathered in her throat, rose to\nher eyes and ran over.\n\nShe continued to crouch on the steps, holding her breath and stiffening\nherself into complete immobility. One motion of her hand, one tap on\nthe pane, and she could picture the sudden change in his face. In every\npulse of her rigid body she was aware of the welcome his eyes and lips\nwould give her; but something kept her from moving. It was not the\nfear of any sanction, human or heavenly; she had never in her life been\nafraid. It was simply that she had suddenly understood what would happen\nif she went in. It was the thing that did happen between young men and\ngirls, and that North Dormer ignored in public and snickered over on the\nsly. It was what Miss Hatchard was still ignorant of, but every girl\nof Charity's class knew about before she left school. It was what had\nhappened to Ally Hawes's sister Julia, and had ended in her going to\nNettleton, and in people's never mentioning her name.\n\nIt did not, of course, always end so sensationally; nor, perhaps, on the\nwhole, so untragically. Charity had always suspected that the shunned\nJulia's fate might have its compensations. There were others, worse\nendings that the village knew of, mean, miserable, unconfessed; other\nlives that went on drearily, without visible change, in the same cramped\nsetting of hypocrisy. But these were not the reasons that held her\nback. Since the day before, she had known exactly what she would feel\nif Harney should take her in his arms: the melting of palm into palm and\nmouth on mouth, and the long flame burning her from head to foot. But\nmixed with this feeling was another: the wondering pride in his liking\nfor her, the startled softness that his sympathy had put into her heart.\nSometimes, when her youth flushed up in her, she had imagined yielding\nlike other girls to furtive caresses in the twilight; but she could not\nso cheapen herself to Harney. She did not know why he was going; but\nsince he was going she felt she must do nothing to deface the image of\nher that he carried away. If he wanted her he must seek her: he must not\nbe surprised into taking her as girls like Julia Hawes were taken....\n\nNo sound came from the sleeping village, and in the deep darkness of\nthe garden she heard now and then a secret rustle of branches, as though\nsome night-bird brushed them. Once a footfall passed the gate, and\nshe shrank back into her corner; but the steps died away and left a\nprofounder quiet. Her eyes were still on Harney's tormented face: she\nfelt she could not move till he moved. But she was beginning to grow\nnumb from her constrained position, and at times her thoughts were so\nindistinct that she seemed to be held there only by a vague weight of\nweariness.\n\nA long time passed in this strange vigil. Harney still lay on the bed,\nmotionless and with fixed eyes, as though following his vision to its\nbitter end. At last he stirred and changed his attitude slightly, and\nCharity's heart began to tremble. But he only flung out his arms and\nsank back into his former position. With a deep sigh he tossed the hair\nfrom his forehead; then his whole body relaxed, his head turned\nsideways on the pillow, and she saw that he had fallen asleep. The sweet\nexpression came back to his lips, and the haggardness faded from his\nface, leaving it as fresh as a boy's.\n\nShe rose and crept away.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nSHE had lost the sense of time, and did not know how late it was till\nshe came out into the street and saw that all the windows were dark\nbetween Miss Hatchard's and the Royall house.\n\nAs she passed from under the black pall of the Norway spruces she\nfancied she saw two figures in the shade about the duck-pond. She drew\nback and watched; but nothing moved, and she had stared so long into the\nlamp-lit room that the darkness confused her, and she thought she must\nhave been mistaken.\n\nShe walked on, wondering whether Mr. Royall was still in the porch. In\nher exalted mood she did not greatly care whether he was waiting for her\nor not: she seemed to be floating high over life, on a great cloud of\nmisery beneath which every-day realities had dwindled to mere specks in\nspace. But the porch was empty, Mr. Royall's hat hung on its peg in the\npassage, and the kitchen lamp had been left to light her to bed. She\ntook it and went up.\n\nThe morning hours of the next day dragged by without incident. Charity\nhad imagined that, in some way or other, she would learn whether Harney\nhad already left; but Verena's deafness prevented her being a source of\nnews, and no one came to the house who could bring enlightenment.\n\nMr. Royall went out early, and did not return till Verena had set the\ntable for the midday meal. When he came in he went straight to the\nkitchen and shouted to the old woman: “Ready for dinner----” then he\nturned into the dining-room, where Charity was already seated. Harney's\nplate was in its usual place, but Mr. Royall offered no explanation\nof his absence, and Charity asked none. The feverish exaltation of the\nnight before had dropped, and she said to herself that he had gone away,\nindifferently, almost callously, and that now her life would lapse again\ninto the narrow rut out of which he had lifted it. For a moment she was\ninclined to sneer at herself for not having used the arts that might\nhave kept him.\n\nShe sat at table till the meal was over, lest Mr. Royall should remark\non her leaving; but when he stood up she rose also, without waiting to\nhelp Verena. She had her foot on the stairs when he called to her to\ncome back.\n\n“I've got a headache. I'm going up to lie down.”\n\n“I want you should come in here first; I've got something to say to\nyou.”\n\nShe was sure from his tone that in a moment she would learn what every\nnerve in her ached to know; but as she turned back she made a last\neffort of indifference.\n\nMr. Royall stood in the middle of the office, his thick eyebrows\nbeetling, his lower jaw trembling a little. At first she thought he had\nbeen drinking; then she saw that he was sober, but stirred by a deep and\nstern emotion totally unlike his usual transient angers. And suddenly\nshe understood that, until then, she had never really noticed him or\nthought about him. Except on the occasion of his one offense he had been\nto her merely the person who is always there, the unquestioned central\nfact of life, as inevitable but as uninteresting as North Dormer itself,\nor any of the other conditions fate had laid on her. Even then she had\nregarded him only in relation to herself, and had never speculated as\nto his own feelings, beyond instinctively concluding that he would not\ntrouble her again in the same way. But now she began to wonder what he\nwas really like.\n\nHe had grasped the back of his chair with both hands, and stood looking\nhard at her. At length he said: “Charity, for once let's you and me talk\ntogether like friends.”\n\nInstantly she felt that something had happened, and that he held her in\nhis hand.\n\n“Where is Mr. Harney? Why hasn't he come back? Have you sent him away?”\n she broke out, without knowing what she was saying.\n\nThe change in Mr. Royall frightened her. All the blood seemed to leave\nhis veins and against his swarthy pallor the deep lines in his face\nlooked black.\n\n“Didn't he have time to answer some of those questions last night? You\nwas with him long enough!” he said.\n\nCharity stood speechless. The taunt was so unrelated to what had been\nhappening in her soul that she hardly understood it. But the instinct of\nself-defense awoke in her.\n\n“Who says I was with him last night?”\n\n“The whole place is saying it by now.”\n\n“Then it was you that put the lie into their mouths.--Oh, how I've\nalways hated you!” she cried.\n\nShe had expected a retort in kind, and it startled her to hear her\nexclamation sounding on through silence.\n\n“Yes, I know,” Mr. Royall said slowly. “But that ain't going to help us\nmuch now.”\n\n“It helps me not to care a straw what lies you tell about me!”\n\n“If they're lies, they're not my lies: my Bible oath on that, Charity. I\ndidn't know where you were: I wasn't out of this house last night.”\n\nShe made no answer and he went on: “Is it a lie that you were seen\ncoming out of Miss Hatchard's nigh onto midnight?”\n\nShe straightened herself with a laugh, all her reckless insolence\nrecovered. “I didn't look to see what time it was.”\n\n“You lost girl... you... you.... Oh, my God, why did you tell me?” he\nbroke out, dropping into his chair, his head bowed down like an old\nman's.\n\nCharity's self-possession had returned with the sense of her danger. “Do\nyou suppose I'd take the trouble to lie to YOU? Who are you, anyhow, to\nask me where I go to when I go out at night?”\n\nMr. Royall lifted his head and looked at her. His face had grown quiet\nand almost gentle, as she remembered seeing it sometimes when she was a\nlittle girl, before Mrs. Royall died.\n\n“Don't let's go on like this, Charity. It can't do any good to either of\nus. You were seen going into that fellow's house... you were seen coming\nout of it.... I've watched this thing coming, and I've tried to stop it.\nAs God sees me, I have....”\n\n“Ah, it WAS you, then? I knew it was you that sent him away!”\n\nHe looked at her in surprise. “Didn't he tell you so? I thought he\nunderstood.” He spoke slowly, with difficult pauses, “I didn't name\nyou to him: I'd have cut my hand off sooner. I just told him I couldn't\nspare the horse any longer; and that the cooking was getting too heavy\nfor Verena. I guess he's the kind that's heard the same thing before.\nAnyhow, he took it quietly enough. He said his job here was about done,\nanyhow; and there didn't another word pass between us.... If he told you\notherwise he told you an untruth.”\n\nCharity listened in a cold trance of anger. It was nothing to her what\nthe village said... but all this fingering of her dreams!\n\n“I've told you he didn't tell me anything. I didn't speak with him last\nnight.”\n\n“You didn't speak with him?”\n\n“No.... It's not that I care what any of you say... but you may as well\nknow. Things ain't between us the way you think... and the other people\nin this place. He was kind to me; he was my friend; and all of a sudden\nhe stopped coming, and I knew it was you that done it--YOU!” All her\nunreconciled memory of the past flamed out at him. “So I went there last\nnight to find out what you'd said to him: that's all.”\n\nMr. Royall drew a heavy breath. “But, then--if he wasn't there, what\nwere you doing there all that time?--Charity, for pity's sake, tell me.\nI've got to know, to stop their talking.”\n\nThis pathetic abdication of all authority over her did not move her: she\ncould feel only the outrage of his interference.\n\n“Can't you see that I don't care what anybody says? It's true I went\nthere to see him; and he was in his room, and I stood outside for ever\nso long and watched him; but I dursn't go in for fear he'd think I'd\ncome after him....” She felt her voice breaking, and gathered it up in a\nlast defiance. “As long as I live I'll never forgive you!” she cried.\n\nMr. Royall made no answer. He sat and pondered with sunken head, his\nveined hands clasped about the arms of his chair. Age seemed to have\ncome down on him as winter comes on the hills after a storm. At length\nhe looked up.\n\n“Charity, you say you don't care; but you're the proudest girl I know,\nand the last to want people to talk against you. You know there's always\neyes watching you: you're handsomer and smarter than the rest, and\nthat's enough. But till lately you've never given them a chance. Now\nthey've got it, and they're going to use it. I believe what you say, but\nthey won't.... It was Mrs. Tom Fry seen you going in... and two or three\nof them watched for you to come out again.... You've been with the fellow\nall day long every day since he come here... and I'm a lawyer, and I know\nhow hard slander dies.” He paused, but she stood motionless, without\ngiving him any sign of acquiescence or even of attention. “He's a\npleasant fellow to talk to--I liked having him here myself. The young\nmen up here ain't had his chances. But there's one thing as old as the\nhills and as plain as daylight: if he'd wanted you the right way he'd\nhave said so.”\n\nCharity did not speak. It seemed to her that nothing could exceed the\nbitterness of hearing such words from such lips.\n\nMr. Royall rose from his seat. “See here, Charity Royall: I had a\nshameful thought once, and you've made me pay for it. Isn't that score\npretty near wiped out?... There's a streak in me I ain't always master\nof; but I've always acted straight to you but that once. And you've\nknown I would--you've trusted me. For all your sneers and your mockery\nyou've always known I loved you the way a man loves a decent woman. I'm\na good many years older than you, but I'm head and shoulders above this\nplace and everybody in it, and you know that too. I slipped up once, but\nthat's no reason for not starting again. If you'll come with me I'll\ndo it. If you'll marry me we'll leave here and settle in some big town,\nwhere there's men, and business, and things doing. It's not too late for\nme to find an opening.... I can see it by the way folks treat me when I\ngo down to Hepburn or Nettleton....”\n\nCharity made no movement. Nothing in his appeal reached her heart, and\nshe thought only of words to wound and wither. But a growing lassitude\nrestrained her. What did anything matter that he was saying? She saw the\nold life closing in on her, and hardly heeded his fanciful picture of\nrenewal.\n\n“Charity--Charity--say you'll do it,” she heard him urge, all his lost\nyears and wasted passion in his voice.\n\n“Oh, what's the use of all this? When I leave here it won't be with\nyou.”\n\nShe moved toward the door as she spoke, and he stood up and placed\nhimself between her and the threshold. He seemed suddenly tall and\nstrong, as though the extremity of his humiliation had given him new\nvigour.\n\n“That's all, is it? It's not much.” He leaned against the door, so\ntowering and powerful that he seemed to fill the narrow room. “Well,\nthen look here.... You're right: I've no claim on you--why should you\nlook at a broken man like me? You want the other fellow... and I don't\nblame you. You picked out the best when you seen it... well, that was\nalways my way.” He fixed his stern eyes on her, and she had the sense\nthat the struggle within him was at its highest. “Do you want him to\nmarry you?” he asked.\n\nThey stood and looked at each other for a long moment, eye to eye, with\nthe terrible equality of courage that sometimes made her feel as if she\nhad his blood in her veins.\n\n“Do you want him to--say? I'll have him here in an hour if you do. I\nain't been in the law thirty years for nothing. He's hired Carrick Fry's\nteam to take him to Hepburn, but he ain't going to start for another\nhour. And I can put things to him so he won't be long deciding.... He's\nsoft: I could see that. I don't say you won't be sorry afterward--but,\nby God, I'll give you the chance to be, if you say so.”\n\nShe heard him out in silence, too remote from all he was feeling and\nsaying for any sally of scorn to relieve her. As she listened, there\nflitted through her mind the vision of Liff Hyatt's muddy boot coming\ndown on the white bramble-flowers. The same thing had happened now;\nsomething transient and exquisite had flowered in her, and she had stood\nby and seen it trampled to earth. While the thought passed through\nher she was aware of Mr. Royall, still leaning against the door, but\ncrestfallen, diminished, as though her silence were the answer he most\ndreaded.\n\n“I don't want any chance you can give me: I'm glad he's going away,” she\nsaid.\n\nHe kept his place a moment longer, his hand on the door-knob. “Charity!”\n he pleaded. She made no answer, and he turned the knob and went out. She\nheard him fumble with the latch of the front door, and saw him walk\ndown the steps. He passed out of the gate, and his figure, stooping and\nheavy, receded slowly up the street.\n\nFor a while she remained where he had left her. She was still trembling\nwith the humiliation of his last words, which rang so loud in her ears\nthat it seemed as though they must echo through the village, proclaiming\nher a creature to lend herself to such vile suggestions. Her shame\nweighed on her like a physical oppression: the roof and walls seemed\nto be closing in on her, and she was seized by the impulse to get away,\nunder the open sky, where there would be room to breathe. She went to\nthe front door, and as she did so Lucius Harney opened it.\n\nHe looked graver and less confident than usual, and for a moment or two\nneither of them spoke. Then he held out his hand. “Are you going out?”\n he asked. “May I come in?”\n\nHer heart was beating so violently that she was afraid to speak, and\nstood looking at him with tear-dilated eyes; then she became aware of\nwhat her silence must betray, and said quickly: “Yes: come in.”\n\nShe led the way into the dining-room, and they sat down on opposite\nsides of the table, the cruet-stand and japanned bread-basket between\nthem. Harney had laid his straw hat on the table, and as he sat there,\nin his easy-looking summer clothes, a brown tie knotted under his\nflannel collar, and his smooth brown hair brushed back from his\nforehead, she pictured him, as she had seen him the night before, lying\non his bed, with the tossed locks falling into his eyes, and his bare\nthroat rising out of his unbuttoned shirt. He had never seemed so remote\nas at the moment when that vision flashed through her mind.\n\n“I'm so sorry it's good-bye: I suppose you know I'm leaving,” he began,\nabruptly and awkwardly; she guessed that he was wondering how much she\nknew of his reasons for going.\n\n“I presume you found your work was over quicker than what you expected,”\n she said.\n\n“Well, yes--that is, no: there are plenty of things I should have liked\nto do. But my holiday's limited; and now that Mr. Royall needs the horse\nfor himself it's rather difficult to find means of getting about.”\n\n“There ain't any too many teams for hire around here,” she acquiesced;\nand there was another silence.\n\n“These days here have been--awfully pleasant: I wanted to thank you for\nmaking them so,” he continued, his colour rising.\n\nShe could not think of any reply, and he went on: “You've been\nwonderfully kind to me, and I wanted to tell you.... I wish I could think\nof you as happier, less lonely.... Things are sure to change for you by\nand by....”\n\n“Things don't change at North Dormer: people just get used to them.”\n\nThe answer seemed to break up the order of his prearranged consolations,\nand he sat looking at her uncertainly. Then he said, with his sweet\nsmile: “That's not true of you. It can't be.”\n\nThe smile was like a knife-thrust through her heart: everything in her\nbegan to tremble and break loose. She felt her tears run over, and stood\nup.\n\n“Well, good-bye,” she said.\n\nShe was aware of his taking her hand, and of feeling that his touch was\nlifeless.\n\n“Good-bye.” He turned away, and stopped on the threshold. “You'll say\ngood-bye for me to Verena?”\n\nShe heard the closing of the outer door and the sound of his quick tread\nalong the path. The latch of the gate clicked after him.\n\nThe next morning when she arose in the cold dawn and opened her shutters\nshe saw a freckled boy standing on the other side of the road and\nlooking up at her. He was a boy from a farm three or four miles down the\nCreston road, and she wondered what he was doing there at that hour, and\nwhy he looked so hard at her window. When he saw her he crossed over and\nleaned against the gate unconcernedly. There was no one stirring in the\nhouse, and she threw a shawl over her night-gown and ran down and let\nherself out. By the time she reached the gate the boy was sauntering\ndown the road, whistling carelessly; but she saw that a letter had been\nthrust between the slats and the crossbar of the gate. She took it out\nand hastened back to her room.\n\nThe envelope bore her name, and inside was a leaf torn from a\npocket-diary.\n\n\nDEAR CHARITY:\n\nI can't go away like this. I am staying for a few days at Creston River.\nWill you come down and meet me at Creston pool? I will wait for you till\nevening.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nCHARITY sat before the mirror trying on a hat which Ally Hawes, with\nmuch secrecy, had trimmed for her. It was of white straw, with a\ndrooping brim and cherry-coloured lining that made her face glow like\nthe inside of the shell on the parlour mantelpiece.\n\nShe propped the square of looking-glass against Mr. Royall's black\nleather Bible, steadying it in front with a white stone on which a view\nof the Brooklyn Bridge was painted; and she sat before her reflection,\nbending the brim this way and that, while Ally Hawes's pale face looked\nover her shoulder like the ghost of wasted opportunities.\n\n“I look awful, don't I?” she said at last with a happy sigh.\n\nAlly smiled and took back the hat. “I'll stitch the roses on right here,\nso's you can put it away at once.”\n\nCharity laughed, and ran her fingers through her rough dark hair.\nShe knew that Harney liked to see its reddish edges ruffled about her\nforehead and breaking into little rings at the nape. She sat down on her\nbed and watched Ally stoop over the hat with a careful frown.\n\n“Don't you ever feel like going down to Nettleton for a day?” she asked.\n\nAlly shook her head without looking up. “No, I always remember that\nawful time I went down with Julia--to that doctor's.”\n\n“Oh, Ally----”\n\n“I can't help it. The house is on the corner of Wing Street and Lake\nAvenue. The trolley from the station goes right by it, and the day the\nminister took us down to see those pictures I recognized it right off,\nand couldn't seem to see anything else. There's a big black sign with\ngold letters all across the front--'Private Consultations.' She came as\nnear as anything to dying....”\n\n“Poor Julia!” Charity sighed from the height of her purity and her\nsecurity. She had a friend whom she trusted and who respected her.\nShe was going with him to spend the next day--the Fourth of July--at\nNettleton. Whose business was it but hers, and what was the harm? The\npity of it was that girls like Julia did not know how to choose, and to\nkeep bad fellows at a distance.... Charity slipped down from the bed, and\nstretched out her hands.\n\n“Is it sewed? Let me try it on again.” She put the hat on, and smiled at\nher image. The thought of Julia had vanished....\n\nThe next morning she was up before dawn, and saw the yellow sunrise\nbroaden behind the hills, and the silvery luster preceding a hot day\ntremble across the sleeping fields.\n\nHer plans had been made with great care. She had announced that she was\ngoing down to the Band of Hope picnic at Hepburn, and as no one else\nfrom North Dormer intended to venture so far it was not likely that her\nabsence from the festivity would be reported. Besides, if it were she\nwould not greatly care. She was determined to assert her independence,\nand if she stooped to fib about the Hepburn picnic it was chiefly\nfrom the secretive instinct that made her dread the profanation of her\nhappiness. Whenever she was with Lucius Harney she would have liked some\nimpenetrable mountain mist to hide her.\n\nIt was arranged that she should walk to a point of the Creston road\nwhere Harney was to pick her up and drive her across the hills to\nHepburn in time for the nine-thirty train to Nettleton. Harney at first\nhad been rather lukewarm about the trip. He declared himself ready to\ntake her to Nettleton, but urged her not to go on the Fourth of July,\non account of the crowds, the probable lateness of the trains,\nthe difficulty of her getting back before night; but her evident\ndisappointment caused him to give way, and even to affect a faint\nenthusiasm for the adventure. She understood why he was not more eager:\nhe must have seen sights beside which even a Fourth of July at Nettleton\nwould seem tame. But she had never seen anything; and a great longing\npossessed her to walk the streets of a big town on a holiday, clinging\nto his arm and jostled by idle crowds in their best clothes. The only\ncloud on the prospect was the fact that the shops would be closed; but\nshe hoped he would take her back another day, when they were open.\n\nShe started out unnoticed in the early sunlight, slipping through the\nkitchen while Verena bent above the stove. To avoid attracting notice,\nshe carried her new hat carefully wrapped up, and had thrown a long\ngrey veil of Mrs. Royall's over the new white muslin dress which Ally's\nclever fingers had made for her. All of the ten dollars Mr. Royall had\ngiven her, and a part of her own savings as well, had been spent on\nrenewing her wardrobe; and when Harney jumped out of the buggy to meet\nher she read her reward in his eyes.\n\nThe freckled boy who had brought her the note two weeks earlier was\nto wait with the buggy at Hepburn till their return. He perched at\nCharity's feet, his legs dangling between the wheels, and they could\nnot say much because of his presence. But it did not greatly matter, for\ntheir past was now rich enough to have given them a private language;\nand with the long day stretching before them like the blue distance\nbeyond the hills there was a delicate pleasure in postponement.\n\nWhen Charity, in response to Harney's message, had gone to meet him at\nthe Creston pool her heart had been so full of mortification and anger\nthat his first words might easily have estranged her. But it happened\nthat he had found the right word, which was one of simple friendship.\nHis tone had instantly justified her, and put her guardian in the\nwrong. He had made no allusion to what had passed between Mr. Royall and\nhimself, but had simply let it appear that he had left because means of\nconveyance were hard to find at North Dormer, and because Creston River\nwas a more convenient centre. He told her that he had hired by the week\nthe buggy of the freckled boy's father, who served as livery-stable\nkeeper to one or two melancholy summer boarding-houses on Creston Lake,\nand had discovered, within driving distance, a number of houses worthy\nof his pencil; and he said that he could not, while he was in the\nneighbourhood, give up the pleasure of seeing her as often as possible.\n\nWhen they took leave of each other she promised to continue to be his\nguide; and during the fortnight which followed they roamed the hills in\nhappy comradeship. In most of the village friendships between youths and\nmaidens lack of conversation was made up for by tentative fondling; but\nHarney, except when he had tried to comfort her in her trouble on their\nway back from the Hyatts', had never put his arm about her, or sought\nto betray her into any sudden caress. It seemed to be enough for him to\nbreathe her nearness like a flower's; and since his pleasure at being\nwith her, and his sense of her youth and her grace, perpetually shone in\nhis eyes and softened the inflection of his voice, his reserve did not\nsuggest coldness, but the deference due to a girl of his own class.\n\nThe buggy was drawn by an old trotter who whirled them along so briskly\nthat the pace created a little breeze; but when they reached Hepburn\nthe full heat of the airless morning descended on them. At the railway\nstation the platform was packed with a sweltering throng, and they took\nrefuge in the waiting-room, where there was another throng, already\ndejected by the heat and the long waiting for retarded trains. Pale\nmothers were struggling with fretful babies, or trying to keep their\nolder offspring from the fascination of the track; girls and their\n“fellows” were giggling and shoving, and passing about candy in sticky\nbags, and older men, collarless and perspiring, were shifting heavy\nchildren from one arm to the other, and keeping a haggard eye on the\nscattered members of their families.\n\nAt last the train rumbled in, and engulfed the waiting multitude. Harney\nswept Charity up on to the first car and they captured a bench for\ntwo, and sat in happy isolation while the train swayed and roared along\nthrough rich fields and languid tree-clumps. The haze of the morning\nhad become a sort of clear tremor over everything, like the colourless\nvibration about a flame; and the opulent landscape seemed to droop under\nit. But to Charity the heat was a stimulant: it enveloped the whole\nworld in the same glow that burned at her heart. Now and then a lurch of\nthe train flung her against Harney, and through her thin muslin she felt\nthe touch of his sleeve. She steadied herself, their eyes met, and the\nflaming breath of the day seemed to enclose them.\n\nThe train roared into the Nettleton station, the descending mob caught\nthem on its tide, and they were swept out into a vague dusty square\nthronged with seedy “hacks” and long curtained omnibuses drawn by horses\nwith tasselled fly-nets over their withers, who stood swinging their\ndepressed heads drearily from side to side.\n\nA mob of 'bus and hack drivers were shouting “To the Eagle House,”\n “To the Washington House,” “This way to the Lake,” “Just starting for\nGreytop;” and through their yells came the popping of fire-crackers,\nthe explosion of torpedoes, the banging of toy-guns, and the crash of\na firemen's band trying to play the Merry Widow while they were being\npacked into a waggonette streaming with bunting.\n\nThe ramshackle wooden hotels about the square were all hung with flags\nand paper lanterns, and as Harney and Charity turned into the main\nstreet, with its brick and granite business blocks crowding out the old\nlow-storied shops, and its towering poles strung with innumerable wires\nthat seemed to tremble and buzz in the heat, they saw the double line of\nflags and lanterns tapering away gaily to the park at the other end of\nthe perspective. The noise and colour of this holiday vision seemed to\ntransform Nettleton into a metropolis. Charity could not believe\nthat Springfield or even Boston had anything grander to show, and\nshe wondered if, at this very moment, Annabel Balch, on the arm of\nas brilliant a young man, were threading her way through scenes as\nresplendent.\n\n“Where shall we go first?” Harney asked; but as she turned her happy\neyes on him he guessed the answer and said: “We'll take a look round,\nshall we?”\n\nThe street swarmed with their fellow-travellers, with other\nexcursionists arriving from other directions, with Nettleton's own\npopulation, and with the mill-hands trooping in from the factories on\nthe Creston. The shops were closed, but one would scarcely have noticed\nit, so numerous were the glass doors swinging open on saloons, on\nrestaurants, on drug-stores gushing from every soda-water tap, on fruit\nand confectionery shops stacked with strawberry-cake, cocoanut drops,\ntrays of glistening molasses candy, boxes of caramels and chewing-gum,\nbaskets of sodden strawberries, and dangling branches of bananas.\nOutside of some of the doors were trestles with banked-up oranges and\napples, spotted pears and dusty raspberries; and the air reeked with\nthe smell of fruit and stale coffee, beer and sarsaparilla and fried\npotatoes.\n\nEven the shops that were closed offered, through wide expanses of\nplate-glass, hints of hidden riches. In some, waves of silk and ribbon\nbroke over shores of imitation moss from which ravishing hats rose like\ntropical orchids. In others, the pink throats of gramophones opened\ntheir giant convolutions in a soundless chorus; or bicycles shining in\nneat ranks seemed to await the signal of an invisible starter; or tiers\nof fancy-goods in leatherette and paste and celluloid dangled their\ninsidious graces; and, in one vast bay that seemed to project them into\nexciting contact with the public, wax ladies in daring dresses chatted\nelegantly, or, with gestures intimate yet blameless, pointed to their\npink corsets and transparent hosiery.\n\nPresently Harney found that his watch had stopped, and turned in at a\nsmall jeweller's shop which chanced to still be open. While the watch\nwas being examined Charity leaned over the glass counter where, on a\nbackground of dark blue velvet, pins, rings, and brooches glittered\nlike the moon and stars. She had never seen jewellry so near by, and\nshe longed to lift the glass lid and plunge her hand among the shining\ntreasures. But already Harney's watch was repaired, and he laid his hand\non her arm and drew her from her dream.\n\n“Which do you like best?” he asked leaning over the counter at her side.\n\n“I don't know....” She pointed to a gold lily-of-the-valley with white\nflowers.\n\n“Don't you think the blue pin's better?” he suggested, and immediately\nshe saw that the lily of the valley was mere trumpery compared to the\nsmall round stone, blue as a mountain lake, with little sparks of light\nall round it. She coloured at her want of discrimination.\n\n“It's so lovely I guess I was afraid to look at it,” she said.\n\nHe laughed, and they went out of the shop; but a few steps away he\nexclaimed: “Oh, by Jove, I forgot something,” and turned back and\nleft her in the crowd. She stood staring down a row of pink gramophone\nthroats till he rejoined her and slipped his arm through hers.\n\n“You mustn't be afraid of looking at the blue pin any longer, because it\nbelongs to you,” he said; and she felt a little box being pressed into\nher hand. Her heart gave a leap of joy, but it reached her lips only in\na shy stammer. She remembered other girls whom she had heard planning to\nextract presents from their fellows, and was seized with a sudden dread\nlest Harney should have imagined that she had leaned over the pretty\nthings in the glass case in the hope of having one given to her....\n\nA little farther down the street they turned in at a glass doorway\nopening on a shining hall with a mahogany staircase, and brass cages in\nits corners. “We must have something to eat,” Harney said; and the next\nmoment Charity found herself in a dressing-room all looking-glass and\nlustrous surfaces, where a party of showy-looking girls were dabbing\non powder and straightening immense plumed hats. When they had gone she\ntook courage to bathe her hot face in one of the marble basins, and\nto straighten her own hat-brim, which the parasols of the crowd had\nindented. The dresses in the shops had so impressed her that she\nscarcely dared look at her reflection; but when she did so, the glow\nof her face under her cherry-coloured hat, and the curve of her young\nshoulders through the transparent muslin, restored her courage; and when\nshe had taken the blue brooch from its box and pinned it on her bosom\nshe walked toward the restaurant with her head high, as if she had\nalways strolled through tessellated halls beside young men in flannels.\n\nHer spirit sank a little at the sight of the slim-waisted waitresses in\nblack, with bewitching mob-caps on their haughty heads, who were moving\ndisdainfully between the tables. “Not f'r another hour,” one of them\ndropped to Harney in passing; and he stood doubtfully glancing about\nhim.\n\n“Oh, well, we can't stay sweltering here,” he decided; “let's try\nsomewhere else--” and with a sense of relief Charity followed him from\nthat scene of inhospitable splendour.\n\nThat “somewhere else” turned out--after more hot tramping, and several\nfailures--to be, of all things, a little open-air place in a back street\nthat called itself a French restaurant, and consisted in two or three\nrickety tables under a scarlet-runner, between a patch of zinnias\nand petunias and a big elm bending over from the next yard. Here they\nlunched on queerly flavoured things, while Harney, leaning back in a\ncrippled rocking-chair, smoked cigarettes between the courses and poured\ninto Charity's glass a pale yellow wine which he said was the very same\none drank in just such jolly places in France.\n\nCharity did not think the wine as good as sarsaparilla, but she sipped a\nmouthful for the pleasure of doing what he did, and of fancying herself\nalone with him in foreign countries. The illusion was increased by their\nbeing served by a deep-bosomed woman with smooth hair and a pleasant\nlaugh, who talked to Harney in unintelligible words, and seemed amazed\nand overjoyed at his answering her in kind. At the other tables other\npeople sat, mill-hands probably, homely but pleasant looking, who spoke\nthe same shrill jargon, and looked at Harney and Charity with friendly\neyes; and between the table-legs a poodle with bald patches and pink\neyes nosed about for scraps, and sat up on his hind legs absurdly.\n\nHarney showed no inclination to move, for hot as their corner was, it\nwas at least shaded and quiet; and, from the main thoroughfares came the\nclanging of trolleys, the incessant popping of torpedoes, the jingle\nof street-organs, the bawling of megaphone men and the loud murmur of\nincreasing crowds. He leaned back, smoking his cigar, patting the dog,\nand stirring the coffee that steamed in their chipped cups. “It's the\nreal thing, you know,” he explained; and Charity hastily revised her\nprevious conception of the beverage.\n\nThey had made no plans for the rest of the day, and when Harney\nasked her what she wanted to do next she was too bewildered by rich\npossibilities to find an answer. Finally she confessed that she longed\nto go to the Lake, where she had not been taken on her former visit,\nand when he answered, “Oh, there's time for that--it will be pleasanter\nlater,” she suggested seeing some pictures like the ones Mr. Miles had\ntaken her to. She thought Harney looked a little disconcerted; but\nhe passed his fine handkerchief over his warm brow, said gaily, “Come\nalong, then,” and rose with a last pat for the pink-eyed dog.\n\nMr. Miles's pictures had been shown in an austere Y.M.C.A. hall,\nwith white walls and an organ; but Harney led Charity to a glittering\nplace--everything she saw seemed to glitter--where they passed, between\nimmense pictures of yellow-haired beauties stabbing villains in evening\ndress, into a velvet-curtained auditorium packed with spectators to\nthe last limit of compression. After that, for a while, everything\nwas merged in her brain in swimming circles of heat and blinding\nalternations of light and darkness. All the world has to show seemed\nto pass before her in a chaos of palms and minarets, charging cavalry\nregiments, roaring lions, comic policemen and scowling murderers; and\nthe crowd around her, the hundreds of hot sallow candy-munching faces,\nyoung, old, middle-aged, but all kindled with the same contagious\nexcitement, became part of the spectacle, and danced on the screen with\nthe rest.\n\nPresently the thought of the cool trolley-run to the Lake grew\nirresistible, and they struggled out of the theatre. As they stood\non the pavement, Harney pale with the heat, and even Charity a little\nconfused by it, a young man drove by in an electric run-about with a\ncalico band bearing the words: “Ten dollars to take you round the Lake.”\n Before Charity knew what was happening, Harney had waved a hand, and\nthey were climbing in. “Say, for twenny-five I'll run you out to see the\nball-game and back,” the driver proposed with an insinuating grin; but\nCharity said quickly: “Oh, I'd rather go rowing on the Lake.” The street\nwas so thronged that progress was slow; but the glory of sitting in the\nlittle carriage while it wriggled its way between laden omnibuses and\ntrolleys made the moments seem too short. “Next turn is Lake Avenue,”\n the young man called out over his shoulder; and as they paused in the\nwake of a big omnibus groaning with Knights of Pythias in cocked hats\nand swords, Charity looked up and saw on the corner a brick house with\na conspicuous black and gold sign across its front. “Dr. Merkle; Private\nConsultations at all hours. Lady Attendants,” she read; and suddenly\nshe remembered Ally Hawes's words: “The house was at the corner of Wing\nStreet and Lake Avenue... there's a big black sign across the front....”\n Through all the heat and the rapture a shiver of cold ran over her.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nTHE Lake at last--a sheet of shining metal brooded over by drooping\ntrees. Charity and Harney had secured a boat and, getting away from the\nwharves and the refreshment-booths, they drifted idly along, hugging the\nshadow of the shore. Where the sun struck the water its shafts flamed\nback blindingly at the heat-veiled sky; and the least shade was black by\ncontrast. The Lake was so smooth that the reflection of the trees on\nits edge seemed enamelled on a solid surface; but gradually, as the sun\ndeclined, the water grew transparent, and Charity, leaning over, plunged\nher fascinated gaze into depths so clear that she saw the inverted\ntree-tops interwoven with the green growths of the bottom.\n\nThey rounded a point at the farther end of the Lake, and entering an\ninlet pushed their bow against a protruding tree-trunk. A green veil of\nwillows overhung them. Beyond the trees, wheat-fields sparkled in the\nsun; and all along the horizon the clear hills throbbed with light.\nCharity leaned back in the stern, and Harney unshipped the oars and lay\nin the bottom of the boat without speaking.\n\nEver since their meeting at the Creston pool he had been subject to\nthese brooding silences, which were as different as possible from the\npauses when they ceased to speak because words were needless. At such\ntimes his face wore the expression she had seen on it when she had\nlooked in at him from the darkness and again there came over her a\nsense of the mysterious distance between them; but usually his fits\nof abstraction were followed by bursts of gaiety that chased away the\nshadow before it chilled her.\n\nShe was still thinking of the ten dollars he had handed to the driver\nof the run-about. It had given them twenty minutes of pleasure, and it\nseemed unimaginable that anyone should be able to buy amusement at that\nrate. With ten dollars he might have bought her an engagement ring; she\nknew that Mrs. Tom Fry's, which came from Springfield, and had a diamond\nin it, had cost only eight seventy-five. But she did not know why the\nthought had occurred to her. Harney would never buy her an engagement\nring: they were friends and comrades, but no more. He had been perfectly\nfair to her: he had never said a word to mislead her. She wondered what\nthe girl was like whose hand was waiting for his ring....\n\nBoats were beginning to thicken on the Lake and the clang of incessantly\narriving trolleys announced the return of the crowds from the\nball-field. The shadows lengthened across the pearl-grey water and two\nwhite clouds near the sun were turning golden. On the opposite shore men\nwere hammering hastily at a wooden scaffolding in a field. Charity asked\nwhat it was for.\n\n“Why, the fireworks. I suppose there'll be a big show.” Harney looked at\nher and a smile crept into his moody eyes. “Have you never seen any good\nfireworks?”\n\n“Miss Hatchard always sends up lovely rockets on the Fourth,” she\nanswered doubtfully.\n\n“Oh----” his contempt was unbounded. “I mean a big performance like\nthis, illuminated boats, and all the rest.”\n\nShe flushed at the picture. “Do they send them up from the Lake, too?”\n\n“Rather. Didn't you notice that big raft we passed? It's wonderful to\nsee the rockets completing their orbits down under one's feet.” She said\nnothing, and he put the oars into the rowlocks. “If we stay we'd better\ngo and pick up something to eat.”\n\n“But how can we get back afterwards?” she ventured, feeling it would\nbreak her heart if she missed it.\n\nHe consulted a time-table, found a ten o'clock train and reassured her.\n“The moon rises so late that it will be dark by eight, and we'll have\nover an hour of it.”\n\nTwilight fell, and lights began to show along the shore. The trolleys\nroaring out from Nettleton became great luminous serpents coiling in and\nout among the trees. The wooden eating-houses at the Lake's edge danced\nwith lanterns, and the dusk echoed with laughter and shouts and the\nclumsy splashing of oars.\n\nHarney and Charity had found a table in the corner of a balcony built\nover the Lake, and were patiently awaiting an unattainable chowder.\nClose under them the water lapped the piles, agitated by the evolutions\nof a little white steamboat trellised with coloured globes which was to\nrun passengers up and down the Lake. It was already black with them as\nit sheered off on its first trip.\n\nSuddenly Charity heard a woman's laugh behind her. The sound was\nfamiliar, and she turned to look. A band of showily dressed girls and\ndapper young men wearing badges of secret societies, with new straw hats\ntilted far back on their square-clipped hair, had invaded the balcony\nand were loudly clamouring for a table. The girl in the lead was the\none who had laughed. She wore a large hat with a long white feather,\nand from under its brim her painted eyes looked at Charity with amused\nrecognition.\n\n“Say! if this ain't like Old Home Week,” she remarked to the girl at her\nelbow; and giggles and glances passed between them. Charity knew at once\nthat the girl with the white feather was Julia Hawes. She had lost her\nfreshness, and the paint under her eyes made her face seem thinner; but\nher lips had the same lovely curve, and the same cold mocking smile, as\nif there were some secret absurdity in the person she was looking at,\nand she had instantly detected it.\n\nCharity flushed to the forehead and looked away. She felt herself\nhumiliated by Julia's sneer, and vexed that the mockery of such a\ncreature should affect her. She trembled lest Harney should notice that\nthe noisy troop had recognized her; but they found no table free, and\npassed on tumultuously.\n\nPresently there was a soft rush through the air and a shower of silver\nfell from the blue evening sky. In another direction, pale Roman candles\nshot up singly through the trees, and a fire-haired rocket swept the\nhorizon like a portent. Between these intermittent flashes the velvet\ncurtains of the darkness were descending, and in the intervals of\neclipse the voices of the crowds seemed to sink to smothered murmurs.\n\nCharity and Harney, dispossessed by newcomers, were at length obliged\nto give up their table and struggle through the throng about the\nboat-landings. For a while there seemed no escape from the tide of late\narrivals; but finally Harney secured the last two places on the stand\nfrom which the more privileged were to see the fireworks. The seats were\nat the end of a row, one above the other. Charity had taken off her hat\nto have an uninterrupted view; and whenever she leaned back to follow\nthe curve of some dishevelled rocket she could feel Harney's knees\nagainst her head.\n\nAfter a while the scattered fireworks ceased. A longer interval of\ndarkness followed, and then the whole night broke into flower. From\nevery point of the horizon, gold and silver arches sprang up and crossed\neach other, sky-orchards broke into blossom, shed their flaming petals\nand hung their branches with golden fruit; and all the while the air was\nfilled with a soft supernatural hum, as though great birds were building\ntheir nests in those invisible tree-tops.\n\nNow and then there came a lull, and a wave of moonlight swept the Lake.\nIn a flash it revealed hundreds of boats, steel-dark against lustrous\nripples; then it withdrew as if with a furling of vast translucent\nwings. Charity's heart throbbed with delight. It was as if all the\nlatent beauty of things had been unveiled to her. She could not imagine\nthat the world held anything more wonderful; but near her she heard\nsomeone say, “You wait till you see the set piece,” and instantly her\nhopes took a fresh flight. At last, just as it was beginning to seem as\nthough the whole arch of the sky were one great lid pressed against her\ndazzled eye-balls, and striking out of them continuous jets of\njewelled light, the velvet darkness settled down again, and a murmur of\nexpectation ran through the crowd.\n\n“Now--now!” the same voice said excitedly; and Charity, grasping the hat\non her knee, crushed it tight in the effort to restrain her rapture.\n\nFor a moment the night seemed to grow more impenetrably black; then\na great picture stood out against it like a constellation. It was\nsurmounted by a golden scroll bearing the inscription, “Washington\ncrossing the Delaware,” and across a flood of motionless golden ripples\nthe National Hero passed, erect, solemn and gigantic, standing with\nfolded arms in the stern of a slowly moving golden boat.\n\nA long “Oh-h-h” burst from the spectators: the stand creaked and shook\nwith their blissful trepidations. “Oh-h-h,” Charity gasped: she had\nforgotten where she was, had at last forgotten even Harney's nearness.\nShe seemed to have been caught up into the stars....\n\nThe picture vanished and darkness came down. In the obscurity she felt\nher head clasped by two hands: her face was drawn backward, and Harney's\nlips were pressed on hers. With sudden vehemence he wound his arms about\nher, holding her head against his breast while she gave him back his\nkisses. An unknown Harney had revealed himself, a Harney who dominated\nher and yet over whom she felt herself possessed of a new mysterious\npower.\n\nBut the crowd was beginning to move, and he had to release her. “Come,”\n he said in a confused voice. He scrambled over the side of the stand,\nand holding up his arm caught her as she sprang to the ground. He passed\nhis arm about her waist, steadying her against the descending rush\nof people; and she clung to him, speechless, exultant, as if all the\ncrowding and confusion about them were a mere vain stirring of the air.\n\n“Come,” he repeated, “we must try to make the trolley.” He drew her\nalong, and she followed, still in her dream. They walked as if they were\none, so isolated in ecstasy that the people jostling them on every side\nseemed impalpable. But when they reached the terminus the illuminated\ntrolley was already clanging on its way, its platforms black with\npassengers. The cars waiting behind it were as thickly packed; and\nthe throng about the terminus was so dense that it seemed hopeless to\nstruggle for a place.\n\n“Last trip up the Lake,” a megaphone bellowed from the wharf; and the\nlights of the little steam-boat came dancing out of the darkness.\n\n“No use waiting here; shall we run up the Lake?” Harney suggested.\n\nThey pushed their way back to the edge of the water just as the\ngang-plank lowered from the white side of the boat. The electric light\nat the end of the wharf flashed full on the descending passengers, and\namong them Charity caught sight of Julia Hawes, her white feather askew,\nand the face under it flushed with coarse laughter. As she stepped from\nthe gang-plank she stopped short, her dark-ringed eyes darting malice.\n\n“Hullo, Charity Royall!” she called out; and then, looking back over\nher shoulder: “Didn't I tell you it was a family party? Here's grandpa's\nlittle daughter come to take him home!”\n\nA snigger ran through the group; and then, towering above them, and\nsteadying himself by the hand-rail in a desperate effort at erectness,\nMr. Royall stepped stiffly ashore. Like the young men of the party, he\nwore a secret society emblem in the buttonhole of his black frock-coat.\nHis head was covered by a new Panama hat, and his narrow black tie,\nhalf undone, dangled down on his rumpled shirt-front. His face, a livid\nbrown, with red blotches of anger and lips sunken in like an old man's,\nwas a lamentable ruin in the searching glare.\n\nHe was just behind Julia Hawes, and had one hand on her arm; but as he\nleft the gang-plank he freed himself, and moved a step or two away\nfrom his companions. He had seen Charity at once, and his glance passed\nslowly from her to Harney, whose arm was still about her. He stood\nstaring at them, and trying to master the senile quiver of his lips;\nthen he drew himself up with the tremulous majesty of drunkenness, and\nstretched out his arm.\n\n“You whore--you damn--bare-headed whore, you!” he enunciated slowly.\n\nThere was a scream of tipsy laughter from the party, and Charity\ninvoluntarily put her hands to her head. She remembered that her hat had\nfallen from her lap when she jumped up to leave the stand; and suddenly\nshe had a vision of herself, hatless, dishevelled, with a man's arm\nabout her, confronting that drunken crew, headed by her guardian's\npitiable figure. The picture filled her with shame. She had known since\nchildhood about Mr. Royall's “habits”: had seen him, as she went up to\nbed, sitting morosely in his office, a bottle at his elbow; or coming\nhome, heavy and quarrelsome, from his business expeditions to Hepburn\nor Springfield; but the idea of his associating himself publicly with a\nband of disreputable girls and bar-room loafers was new and dreadful to\nher.\n\n“Oh----” she said in a gasp of misery; and releasing herself from\nHarney's arm she went straight up to Mr. Royall.\n\n“You come home with me--you come right home with me,” she said in a\nlow stern voice, as if she had not heard his apostrophe; and one of the\ngirls called out: “Say, how many fellers does she want?”\n\nThere was another laugh, followed by a pause of curiosity, during which\nMr. Royall continued to glare at Charity. At length his twitching\nlips parted. “I said, 'You--damn--whore!'” he repeated with precision,\nsteadying himself on Julia's shoulder.\n\nLaughs and jeers were beginning to spring up from the circle of people\nbeyond their group; and a voice called out from the gangway: “Now,\nthen, step lively there--all ABOARD!” The pressure of approaching and\ndeparting passengers forced the actors in the rapid scene apart, and\npushed them back into the throng. Charity found herself clinging to\nHarney's arm and sobbing desperately. Mr. Royall had disappeared, and in\nthe distance she heard the receding sound of Julia's laugh.\n\nThe boat, laden to the taffrail, was puffing away on her last trip.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nAT two o'clock in the morning the freckled boy from Creston stopped his\nsleepy horse at the door of the red house, and Charity got out. Harney\nhad taken leave of her at Creston River, charging the boy to drive her\nhome. Her mind was still in a fog of misery, and she did not remember\nvery clearly what had happened, or what they said to each other, during\nthe interminable interval since their departure from Nettleton; but the\nsecretive instinct of the animal in pain was so strong in her that she\nhad a sense of relief when Harney got out and she drove on alone.\n\nThe full moon hung over North Dormer, whitening the mist that filled the\nhollows between the hills and floated transparently above the fields.\nCharity stood a moment at the gate, looking out into the waning night.\nShe watched the boy drive off, his horse's head wagging heavily to and\nfro; then she went around to the kitchen door and felt under the mat for\nthe key. She found it, unlocked the door and went in. The kitchen\nwas dark, but she discovered a box of matches, lit a candle and went\nupstairs. Mr. Royall's door, opposite hers, stood open on his unlit\nroom; evidently he had not come back. She went into her room, bolted her\ndoor and began slowly to untie the ribbon about her waist, and to take\noff her dress. Under the bed she saw the paper bag in which she had\nhidden her new hat from inquisitive eyes....\n\nShe lay for a long time sleepless on her bed, staring up at the\nmoonlight on the low ceiling; dawn was in the sky when she fell asleep,\nand when she woke the sun was on her face.\n\nShe dressed and went down to the kitchen. Verena was there alone: she\nglanced at Charity tranquilly, with her old deaf-looking eyes. There was\nno sign of Mr. Royall about the house and the hours passed without his\nreappearing. Charity had gone up to her room, and sat there listlessly,\nher hands on her lap. Puffs of sultry air fanned her dimity window\ncurtains and flies buzzed stiflingly against the bluish panes.\n\nAt one o'clock Verena hobbled up to see if she were not coming down to\ndinner; but she shook her head, and the old woman went away, saying:\n“I'll cover up, then.”\n\nThe sun turned and left her room, and Charity seated herself in the\nwindow, gazing down the village street through the half-opened shutters.\nNot a thought was in her mind; it was just a dark whirlpool of crowding\nimages; and she watched the people passing along the street, Dan\nTargatt's team hauling a load of pine-trunks down to Hepburn, the\nsexton's old white horse grazing on the bank across the way, as if she\nlooked at these familiar sights from the other side of the grave.\n\nShe was roused from her apathy by seeing Ally Hawes come out of the\nFrys' gate and walk slowly toward the red house with her uneven limping\nstep. At the sight Charity recovered her severed contact with reality.\nShe divined that Ally was coming to hear about her day: no one else\nwas in the secret of the trip to Nettleton, and it had flattered Ally\nprofoundly to be allowed to know of it.\n\nAt the thought of having to see her, of having to meet her eyes and\nanswer or evade her questions, the whole horror of the previous night's\nadventure rushed back upon Charity. What had been a feverish nightmare\nbecame a cold and unescapable fact. Poor Ally, at that moment,\nrepresented North Dormer, with all its mean curiosities, its furtive\nmalice, its sham unconsciousness of evil. Charity knew that, although\nall relations with Julia were supposed to be severed, the tender-hearted\nAlly still secretly communicated with her; and no doubt Julia would\nexult in the chance of retailing the scandal of the wharf. The story,\nexaggerated and distorted, was probably already on its way to North\nDormer.\n\nAlly's dragging pace had not carried her far from the Frys' gate when\nshe was stopped by old Mrs. Sollas, who was a great talker, and spoke\nvery slowly because she had never been able to get used to her new teeth\nfrom Hepburn. Still, even this respite would not last long; in another\nten minutes Ally would be at the door, and Charity would hear her\ngreeting Verena in the kitchen, and then calling up from the foot of the\nstairs.\n\nSuddenly it became clear that flight, and instant flight, was the only\nthing conceivable. The longing to escape, to get away from familiar\nfaces, from places where she was known, had always been strong in her in\nmoments of distress. She had a childish belief in the miraculous power\nof strange scenes and new faces to transform her life and wipe out\nbitter memories. But such impulses were mere fleeting whims compared to\nthe cold resolve which now possessed her. She felt she could not remain\nan hour longer under the roof of the man who had publicly dishonoured\nher, and face to face with the people who would presently be gloating\nover all the details of her humiliation.\n\nHer passing pity for Mr. Royall had been swallowed up in loathing:\neverything in her recoiled from the disgraceful spectacle of the drunken\nold man apostrophizing her in the presence of a band of loafers and\nstreet-walkers. Suddenly, vividly, she relived again the horrible moment\nwhen he had tried to force himself into her room, and what she had\nbefore supposed to be a mad aberration now appeared to her as a vulgar\nincident in a debauched and degraded life.\n\nWhile these thoughts were hurrying through her she had dragged out\nher old canvas school-bag, and was thrusting into it a few articles of\nclothing and the little packet of letters she had received from Harney.\nFrom under her pincushion she took the library key, and laid it in full\nview; then she felt at the back of a drawer for the blue brooch that\nHarney had given her. She would not have dared to wear it openly at\nNorth Dormer, but now she fastened it on her bosom as if it were a\ntalisman to protect her in her flight. These preparations had taken but\na few minutes, and when they were finished Ally Hawes was still at the\nFrys' corner talking to old Mrs. Sollas....\n\nShe had said to herself, as she always said in moments of revolt: “I'll\ngo to the Mountain--I'll go back to my own folks.” She had never really\nmeant it before; but now, as she considered her case, no other course\nseemed open. She had never learned any trade that would have given her\nindependence in a strange place, and she knew no one in the big towns of\nthe valley, where she might have hoped to find employment. Miss Hatchard\nwas still away; but even had she been at North Dormer she was the last\nperson to whom Charity would have turned, since one of the motives\nurging her to flight was the wish not to see Lucius Harney. Travelling\nback from Nettleton, in the crowded brightly-lit train, all exchange of\nconfidence between them had been impossible; but during their drive\nfrom Hepburn to Creston River she had gathered from Harney's snatches of\nconsolatory talk--again hampered by the freckled boy's presence--that\nhe intended to see her the next day. At the moment she had found a vague\ncomfort in the assurance; but in the desolate lucidity of the hours that\nfollowed she had come to see the impossibility of meeting him again.\nHer dream of comradeship was over; and the scene on the wharf--vile and\ndisgraceful as it had been--had after all shed the light of truth on her\nminute of madness. It was as if her guardian's words had stripped her\nbare in the face of the grinning crowd and proclaimed to the world the\nsecret admonitions of her conscience.\n\nShe did not think these things out clearly; she simply followed the\nblind propulsion of her wretchedness. She did not want, ever again, to\nsee anyone she had known; above all, she did not want to see Harney....\n\nShe climbed the hill-path behind the house and struck through the woods\nby a short-cut leading to the Creston road. A lead-coloured sky hung\nheavily over the fields, and in the forest the motionless air was\nstifling; but she pushed on, impatient to reach the road which was the\nshortest way to the Mountain.\n\nTo do so, she had to follow the Creston road for a mile or two, and go\nwithin half a mile of the village; and she walked quickly, fearing to\nmeet Harney. But there was no sign of him, and she had almost reached\nthe branch road when she saw the flanks of a large white tent projecting\nthrough the trees by the roadside. She supposed that it sheltered a\ntravelling circus which had come there for the Fourth; but as she drew\nnearer she saw, over the folded-back flap, a large sign bearing the\ninscription, “Gospel Tent.” The interior seemed to be empty; but a young\nman in a black alpaca coat, his lank hair parted over a round white\nface, stepped from under the flap and advanced toward her with a smile.\n\n“Sister, your Saviour knows everything. Won't you come in and lay your\nguilt before Him?” he asked insinuatingly, putting his hand on her arm.\n\nCharity started back and flushed. For a moment she thought the\nevangelist must have heard a report of the scene at Nettleton; then she\nsaw the absurdity of the supposition.\n\n“I on'y wish't I had any to lay!” she retorted, with one of her fierce\nflashes of self-derision; and the young man murmured, aghast: “Oh,\nSister, don't speak blasphemy....”\n\nBut she had jerked her arm out of his hold, and was running up the\nbranch road, trembling with the fear of meeting a familiar face.\nPresently she was out of sight of the village, and climbing into the\nheart of the forest. She could not hope to do the fifteen miles to the\nMountain that afternoon; but she knew of a place half-way to Hamblin\nwhere she could sleep, and where no one would think of looking for her.\nIt was a little deserted house on a slope in one of the lonely rifts of\nthe hills. She had seen it once, years before, when she had gone on a\nnutting expedition to the grove of walnuts below it. The party had taken\nrefuge in the house from a sudden mountain storm, and she remembered\nthat Ben Sollas, who liked frightening girls, had told them that it was\nsaid to be haunted.\n\nShe was growing faint and tired, for she had eaten nothing since\nmorning, and was not used to walking so far. Her head felt light and she\nsat down for a moment by the roadside. As she sat there she heard the\nclick of a bicycle-bell, and started up to plunge back into the forest;\nbut before she could move the bicycle had swept around the curve of the\nroad, and Harney, jumping off, was approaching her with outstretched\narms.\n\n“Charity! What on earth are you doing here?”\n\nShe stared as if he were a vision, so startled by the unexpectedness of\nhis being there that no words came to her.\n\n“Where were you going? Had you forgotten that I was coming?” he\ncontinued, trying to draw her to him; but she shrank from his embrace.\n\n“I was going away--I don't want to see you--I want you should leave me\nalone,” she broke out wildly.\n\nHe looked at her and his face grew grave, as though the shadow of a\npremonition brushed it.\n\n“Going away--from me, Charity?”\n\n“From everybody. I want you should leave me.”\n\nHe stood glancing doubtfully up and down the lonely forest road that\nstretched away into sun-flecked distances.\n\n“Where were you going?'\n\n“Home.”\n\n“Home--this way?”\n\nShe threw her head back defiantly. “To my home--up yonder: to the\nMountain.”\n\nAs she spoke she became aware of a change in his face. He was no longer\nlistening to her, he was only looking at her, with the passionate\nabsorbed expression she had seen in his eyes after they had kissed on\nthe stand at Nettleton. He was the new Harney again, the Harney abruptly\nrevealed in that embrace, who seemed so penetrated with the joy of\nher presence that he was utterly careless of what she was thinking or\nfeeling.\n\nHe caught her hands with a laugh. “How do you suppose I found you?” he\nsaid gaily. He drew out the little packet of his letters and flourished\nthem before her bewildered eyes.\n\n“You dropped them, you imprudent young person--dropped them in the\nmiddle of the road, not far from here; and the young man who is running\nthe Gospel tent picked them up just as I was riding by.” He drew back,\nholding her at arm's length, and scrutinizing her troubled face with the\nminute searching gaze of his short-sighted eyes.\n\n“Did you really think you could run away from me? You see you weren't\nmeant to,” he said; and before she could answer he had kissed her again,\nnot vehemently, but tenderly, almost fraternally, as if he had guessed\nher confused pain, and wanted her to know he understood it. He wound his\nfingers through hers.\n\n“Come let's walk a little. I want to talk to you. There's so much to\nsay.”\n\nHe spoke with a boy's gaiety, carelessly and confidently, as if nothing\nhad happened that could shame or embarrass them; and for a moment, in\nthe sudden relief of her release from lonely pain, she felt herself\nyielding to his mood. But he had turned, and was drawing her back along\nthe road by which she had come. She stiffened herself and stopped short.\n\n“I won't go back,” she said.\n\nThey looked at each other a moment in silence; then he answered gently:\n“Very well: let's go the other way, then.”\n\nShe remained motionless, gazing silently at the ground, and he went on:\n“Isn't there a house up here somewhere--a little abandoned house--you\nmeant to show me some day?” Still she made no answer, and he continued,\nin the same tone of tender reassurance: “Let us go there now and sit\ndown and talk quietly.” He took one of the hands that hung by her side\nand pressed his lips to the palm. “Do you suppose I'm going to let you\nsend me away? Do you suppose I don't understand?”\n\nThe little old house--its wooden walls sun-bleached to a ghostly\ngray--stood in an orchard above the road. The garden palings had fallen,\nbut the broken gate dangled between its posts, and the path to the house\nwas marked by rose-bushes run wild and hanging their small pale blossoms\nabove the crowding grasses. Slender pilasters and an intricate fan-light\nframed the opening where the door had hung; and the door itself lay\nrotting in the grass, with an old apple-tree fallen across it.\n\nInside, also, wind and weather had blanched everything to the same\nwan silvery tint; the house was as dry and pure as the interior of a\nlong-empty shell. But it must have been exceptionally well built, for\nthe little rooms had kept something of their human aspect: the wooden\nmantels with their neat classic ornaments were in place, and the corners\nof one ceiling retained a light film of plaster tracery.\n\nHarney had found an old bench at the back door and dragged it into the\nhouse. Charity sat on it, leaning her head against the wall in a state\nof drowsy lassitude. He had guessed that she was hungry and thirsty,\nand had brought her some tablets of chocolate from his bicycle-bag, and\nfilled his drinking-cup from a spring in the orchard; and now he sat at\nher feet, smoking a cigarette, and looking up at her without speaking.\nOutside, the afternoon shadows were lengthening across the grass, and\nthrough the empty window-frame that faced her she saw the Mountain\nthrusting its dark mass against a sultry sunset. It was time to go.\n\nShe stood up, and he sprang to his feet also, and passed his arm through\nhers with an air of authority. “Now, Charity, you're coming back with\nme.”\n\nShe looked at him and shook her head. “I ain't ever going back. You\ndon't know.”\n\n“What don't I know?” She was silent, and he continued: “What happened on\nthe wharf was horrible--it's natural you should feel as you do. But it\ndoesn't make any real difference: you can't be hurt by such things.\nYou must try to forget. And you must try to understand that men... men\nsometimes...”\n\n“I know about men. That's why.”\n\nHe coloured a little at the retort, as though it had touched him in a\nway she did not suspect.\n\n“Well, then... you must know one has to make allowances.... He'd been\ndrinking....”\n\n“I know all that, too. I've seen him so before. But he wouldn't have\ndared speak to me that way if he hadn't...”\n\n“Hadn't what? What do you mean?”\n\n“Hadn't wanted me to be like those other girls....” She lowered her\nvoice and looked away from him. “So's 't he wouldn't have to go out....”\n\nHarney stared at her. For a moment he did not seem to seize her meaning;\nthen his face grew dark. “The damned hound! The villainous low\nhound!” His wrath blazed up, crimsoning him to the temples. “I never\ndreamed--good God, it's too vile,” he broke off, as if his thoughts\nrecoiled from the discovery.\n\n“I won't never go back there,” she repeated doggedly.\n\n“No----” he assented.\n\nThere was a long interval of silence, during which she imagined that he\nwas searching her face for more light on what she had revealed to him;\nand a flush of shame swept over her.\n\n“I know the way you must feel about me,” she broke out, “...telling you\nsuch things....”\n\nBut once more, as she spoke, she became aware that he was no longer\nlistening. He came close and caught her to him as if he were snatching\nher from some imminent peril: his impetuous eyes were in hers, and she\ncould feel the hard beat of his heart as he held her against it.\n\n“Kiss me again--like last night,” he said, pushing her hair back as if\nto draw her whole face up into his kiss.\n\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nONE afternoon toward the end of August a group of girls sat in a room at\nMiss Hatchard's in a gay confusion of flags, turkey-red, blue and white\npaper muslin, harvest sheaves and illuminated scrolls.\n\nNorth Dormer was preparing for its Old Home Week. That form of\nsentimental decentralization was still in its early stages, and,\nprecedents being few, and the desire to set an example contagious, the\nmatter had become a subject of prolonged and passionate discussion under\nMiss Hatchard's roof. The incentive to the celebration had come rather\nfrom those who had left North Dormer than from those who had been\nobliged to stay there, and there was some difficulty in rousing the\nvillage to the proper state of enthusiasm. But Miss Hatchard's pale prim\ndrawing-room was the centre of constant comings and goings from Hepburn,\nNettleton, Springfield and even more distant cities; and whenever a\nvisitor arrived he was led across the hall, and treated to a glimpse of\nthe group of girls deep in their pretty preparations.\n\n“All the old names... all the old names....” Miss Hatchard would be\nheard, tapping across the hall on her crutches. “Targatt... Sollas...\nFry: this is Miss Orma Fry sewing the stars on the drapery for the\norgan-loft. Don't move, girls... and this is Miss Ally Hawes, our\ncleverest needle-woman... and Miss Charity Royall making our garlands of\nevergreen.... I like the idea of its all being homemade, don't you? We\nhaven't had to call in any foreign talent: my young cousin Lucius\nHarney, the architect--you know he's up here preparing a book on\nColonial houses--he's taken the whole thing in hand so cleverly; but you\nmust come and see his sketch for the stage we're going to put up in the\nTown Hall.”\n\nOne of the first results of the Old Home Week agitation had, in fact,\nbeen the reappearance of Lucius Harney in the village street. He had\nbeen vaguely spoken of as being not far off, but for some weeks past no\none had seen him at North Dormer, and there was a recent report of his\nhaving left Creston River, where he was said to have been staying, and\ngone away from the neighbourhood for good. Soon after Miss Hatchard's\nreturn, however, he came back to his old quarters in her house, and\nbegan to take a leading part in the planning of the festivities. He\nthrew himself into the idea with extraordinary good-humour, and was so\nprodigal of sketches, and so inexhaustible in devices, that he gave an\nimmediate impetus to the rather languid movement, and infected the whole\nvillage with his enthusiasm.\n\n“Lucius has such a feeling for the past that he has roused us all to a\nsense of our privileges,” Miss Hatchard would say, lingering on the last\nword, which was a favourite one. And before leading her visitor back\nto the drawing-room she would repeat, for the hundredth time, that she\nsupposed he thought it very bold of little North Dormer to start up and\nhave a Home Week of its own, when so many bigger places hadn't thought\nof it yet; but that, after all, Associations counted more than the size\nof the population, didn't they? And of course North Dormer was so full\nof Associations... historic, literary (here a filial sigh for Honorius)\nand ecclesiastical... he knew about the old pewter communion service\nimported from England in 1769, she supposed? And it was so important, in\na wealthy materialistic age, to set the example of reverting to the old\nideals, the family and the homestead, and so on. This peroration usually\ncarried her half-way back across the hall, leaving the girls to return\nto their interrupted activities.\n\nThe day on which Charity Royall was weaving hemlock garlands for the\nprocession was the last before the celebration. When Miss Hatchard\ncalled upon the North Dormer maidenhood to collaborate in the festal\npreparations Charity had at first held aloof; but it had been made\nclear to her that her non-appearance might excite conjecture, and,\nreluctantly, she had joined the other workers. The girls, at first shy\nand embarrassed, and puzzled as to the exact nature of the projected\ncommemoration, had soon become interested in the amusing details of\ntheir task, and excited by the notice they received. They would not for\nthe world have missed their afternoons at Miss Hatchard's, and, while\nthey cut out and sewed and draped and pasted, their tongues kept up such\nan accompaniment to the sewing-machine that Charity's silence sheltered\nitself unperceived under their chatter.\n\nIn spirit she was still almost unconscious of the pleasant stir about\nher. Since her return to the red house, on the evening of the day when\nHarney had overtaken her on her way to the Mountain, she had lived at\nNorth Dormer as if she were suspended in the void. She had come back\nthere because Harney, after appearing to agree to the impossibility of\nher doing so, had ended by persuading her that any other course would\nbe madness. She had nothing further to fear from Mr. Royall. Of this\nshe had declared herself sure, though she had failed to add, in his\nexoneration, that he had twice offered to make her his wife. Her hatred\nof him made it impossible, at the moment, for her to say anything that\nmight partly excuse him in Harney's eyes.\n\nHarney, however, once satisfied of her security, had found plenty of\nreasons for urging her to return. The first, and the most unanswerable,\nwas that she had nowhere else to go. But the one on which he laid the\ngreatest stress was that flight would be equivalent to avowal. If--as\nwas almost inevitable--rumours of the scandalous scene at Nettleton\nshould reach North Dormer, how else would her disappearance be\ninterpreted? Her guardian had publicly taken away her character, and she\nimmediately vanished from his house. Seekers after motives could hardly\nfail to draw an unkind conclusion. But if she came back at once, and\nwas seen leading her usual life, the incident was reduced to its true\nproportions, as the outbreak of a drunken old man furious at being\nsurprised in disreputable company. People would say that Mr. Royall had\ninsulted his ward to justify himself, and the sordid tale would fall\ninto its place in the chronicle of his obscure debaucheries.\n\nCharity saw the force of the argument; but if she acquiesced it was\nnot so much because of that as because it was Harney's wish. Since that\nevening in the deserted house she could imagine no reason for doing or\nnot doing anything except the fact that Harney wished or did not wish\nit. All her tossing contradictory impulses were merged in a fatalistic\nacceptance of his will. It was not that she felt in him any ascendancy\nof character--there were moments already when she knew she was the\nstronger--but that all the rest of life had become a mere cloudy rim\nabout the central glory of their passion. Whenever she stopped thinking\nabout that for a moment she felt as she sometimes did after lying on the\ngrass and staring up too long at the sky; her eyes were so full of light\nthat everything about her was a blur.\n\nEach time that Miss Hatchard, in the course of her periodical incursions\ninto the work-room, dropped an allusion to her young cousin, the\narchitect, the effect was the same on Charity. The hemlock garland she\nwas wearing fell to her knees and she sat in a kind of trance. It was\nso manifestly absurd that Miss Hatchard should talk of Harney in\nthat familiar possessive way, as if she had any claim on him, or knew\nanything about him. She, Charity Royall, was the only being on earth\nwho really knew him, knew him from the soles of his feet to the rumpled\ncrest of his hair, knew the shifting lights in his eyes, and the\ninflexions of his voice, and the things he liked and disliked,\nand everything there was to know about him, as minutely and yet\nunconsciously as a child knows the walls of the room it wakes up in\nevery morning. It was this fact, which nobody about her guessed,\nor would have understood, that made her life something apart and\ninviolable, as if nothing had any power to hurt or disturb her as long\nas her secret was safe.\n\nThe room in which the girls sat was the one which had been Harney's\nbedroom. He had been sent upstairs, to make room for the Home Week\nworkers; but the furniture had not been moved, and as Charity sat there\nshe had perpetually before her the vision she had looked in on from the\nmidnight garden. The table at which Harney had sat was the one about\nwhich the girls were gathered; and her own seat was near the bed on\nwhich she had seen him lying. Sometimes, when the others were not\nlooking, she bent over as if to pick up something, and laid her cheek\nfor a moment against the pillow.\n\nToward sunset the girls disbanded. Their work was done, and the next\nmorning at daylight the draperies and garlands were to be nailed up, and\nthe illuminated scrolls put in place in the Town Hall. The first guests\nwere to drive over from Hepburn in time for the midday banquet under\na tent in Miss Hatchard's field; and after that the ceremonies were\nto begin. Miss Hatchard, pale with fatigue and excitement, thanked her\nyoung assistants, and stood in the porch, leaning on her crutches and\nwaving a farewell as she watched them troop away down the street.\n\nCharity had slipped off among the first; but at the gate she heard Ally\nHawes calling after her, and reluctantly turned.\n\n“Will you come over now and try on your dress?” Ally asked, looking at\nher with wistful admiration. “I want to be sure the sleeves don't ruck\nup the same as they did yesterday.”\n\nCharity gazed at her with dazzled eyes. “Oh, it's lovely,” she said, and\nhastened away without listening to Ally's protest. She wanted her dress\nto be as pretty as the other girls'--wanted it, in fact, to outshine the\nrest, since she was to take part in the “exercises”--but she had no time\njust then to fix her mind on such matters....\n\nShe sped up the street to the library, of which she had the key about\nher neck. From the passage at the back she dragged forth a bicycle, and\nguided it to the edge of the street. She looked about to see if any of\nthe girls were approaching; but they had drifted away together toward\nthe Town Hall, and she sprang into the saddle and turned toward the\nCreston road. There was an almost continual descent to Creston, and with\nher feet against the pedals she floated through the still evening\nair like one of the hawks she had often watched slanting downward on\nmotionless wings. Twenty minutes from the time when she had left Miss\nHatchard's door she was turning up the wood-road on which Harney had\novertaken her on the day of her flight; and a few minutes afterward she\nhad jumped from her bicycle at the gate of the deserted house.\n\nIn the gold-powdered sunset it looked more than ever like some frail\nshell dried and washed by many seasons; but at the back, whither Charity\nadvanced, drawing her bicycle after her, there were signs of recent\nhabitation. A rough door made of boards hung in the kitchen doorway,\nand pushing it open she entered a room furnished in primitive camping\nfashion. In the window was a table, also made of boards, with an\nearthenware jar holding a big bunch of wild asters, two canvas chairs\nstood near by, and in one corner was a mattress with a Mexican blanket\nover it.\n\nThe room was empty, and leaning her bicycle against the house Charity\nclambered up the slope and sat down on a rock under an old apple-tree.\nThe air was perfectly still, and from where she sat she would be able to\nhear the tinkle of a bicycle-bell a long way down the road....\n\nShe was always glad when she got to the little house before Harney. She\nliked to have time to take in every detail of its secret sweetness--the\nshadows of the apple-trees swaying on the grass, the old walnuts\nrounding their domes below the road, the meadows sloping westward in the\nafternoon light--before his first kiss blotted it all out. Everything\nunrelated to the hours spent in that tranquil place was as faint as the\nremembrance of a dream. The only reality was the wondrous unfolding\nof her new self, the reaching out to the light of all her contracted\ntendrils. She had lived all her life among people whose sensibilities\nseemed to have withered for lack of use; and more wonderful, at first,\nthan Harney's endearments were the words that were a part of them. She\nhad always thought of love as something confused and furtive, and he\nmade it as bright and open as the summer air.\n\nOn the morrow of the day when she had shown him the way to the deserted\nhouse he had packed up and left Creston River for Boston; but at the\nfirst station he had jumped on the train with a hand-bag and scrambled\nup into the hills. For two golden rainless August weeks he had camped in\nthe house, getting eggs and milk from the solitary farm in the valley,\nwhere no one knew him, and doing his cooking over a spirit-lamp. He got\nup every day with the sun, took a plunge in a brown pool he knew of, and\nspent long hours lying in the scented hemlock-woods above the house, or\nwandering along the yoke of the Eagle Ridge, far above the misty blue\nvalleys that swept away east and west between the endless hills. And in\nthe afternoon Charity came to him.\n\nWith part of what was left of her savings she had hired a bicycle for\na month, and every day after dinner, as soon as her guardian started to\nhis office, she hurried to the library, got out her bicycle, and flew\ndown the Creston road. She knew that Mr. Royall, like everyone else in\nNorth Dormer, was perfectly aware of her acquisition: possibly he, as\nwell as the rest of the village, knew what use she made of it. She did\nnot care: she felt him to be so powerless that if he had questioned her\nshe would probably have told him the truth. But they had never spoken to\neach other since the night on the wharf at Nettleton. He had returned to\nNorth Dormer only on the third day after that encounter, arriving just\nas Charity and Verena were sitting down to supper. He had drawn up his\nchair, taken his napkin from the side-board drawer, pulled it out of its\nring, and seated himself as unconcernedly as if he had come in from\nhis usual afternoon session at Carrick Fry's; and the long habit of the\nhousehold made it seem almost natural that Charity should not so much as\nraise her eyes when he entered. She had simply let him understand that\nher silence was not accidental by leaving the table while he was still\neating, and going up without a word to shut herself into her room.\nAfter that he formed the habit of talking loudly and genially to Verena\nwhenever Charity was in the room; but otherwise there was no apparent\nchange in their relations.\n\nShe did not think connectedly of these things while she sat waiting for\nHarney, but they remained in her mind as a sullen background against\nwhich her short hours with him flamed out like forest fires. Nothing\nelse mattered, neither the good nor the bad, or what might have seemed\nso before she knew him. He had caught her up and carried her away into\na new world, from which, at stated hours, the ghost of her came back to\nperform certain customary acts, but all so thinly and insubstantially\nthat she sometimes wondered that the people she went about among could\nsee her....\n\nBehind the swarthy Mountain the sun had gone down in waveless gold. From\na pasture up the slope a tinkle of cow-bells sounded; a puff of smoke\nhung over the farm in the valley, trailed on the pure air and was gone.\nFor a few minutes, in the clear light that is all shadow, fields and\nwoods were outlined with an unreal precision; then the twilight blotted\nthem out, and the little house turned gray and spectral under its\nwizened apple-branches.\n\nCharity's heart contracted. The first fall of night after a day of\nradiance often gave her a sense of hidden menace: it was like looking\nout over the world as it would be when love had gone from it. She\nwondered if some day she would sit in that same place and watch in vain\nfor her lover....\n\nHis bicycle-bell sounded down the lane, and in a minute she was at the\ngate and his eyes were laughing in hers. They walked back through the\nlong grass, and pushed open the door behind the house. The room at\nfirst seemed quite dark and they had to grope their way in hand in hand.\nThrough the window-frame the sky looked light by contrast, and above the\nblack mass of asters in the earthen jar one white star glimmered like a\nmoth.\n\n“There was such a lot to do at the last minute,” Harney was explaining,\n“and I had to drive down to Creston to meet someone who has come to stay\nwith my cousin for the show.”\n\nHe had his arms about her, and his kisses were in her hair and on her\nlips. Under his touch things deep down in her struggled to the light and\nsprang up like flowers in sunshine. She twisted her fingers into his,\nand they sat down side by side on the improvised couch. She hardly heard\nhis excuses for being late: in his absence a thousand doubts tormented\nher, but as soon as he appeared she ceased to wonder where he had come\nfrom, what had delayed him, who had kept him from her. It seemed as if\nthe places he had been in, and the people he had been with, must cease\nto exist when he left them, just as her own life was suspended in his\nabsence.\n\nHe continued, now, to talk to her volubly and gaily, deploring his\nlateness, grumbling at the demands on his time, and good-humouredly\nmimicking Miss Hatchard's benevolent agitation. “She hurried off Miles\nto ask Mr. Royall to speak at the Town Hall tomorrow: I didn't know till\nit was done.” Charity was silent, and he added: “After all, perhaps it's\njust as well. No one else could have done it.”\n\nCharity made no answer: She did not care what part her guardian played\nin the morrow's ceremonies. Like all the other figures peopling her\nmeagre world he had grown non-existent to her. She had even put off\nhating him.\n\n“Tomorrow I shall only see you from far off,” Harney continued. “But in\nthe evening there'll be the dance in the Town Hall. Do you want me to\npromise not to dance with any other girl?”\n\nAny other girl? Were there any others? She had forgotten even that\nperil, so enclosed did he and she seem in their secret world. Her heart\ngave a frightened jerk.\n\n“Yes, promise.”\n\nHe laughed and took her in his arms. “You goose--not even if they're\nhideous?”\n\nHe pushed the hair from her forehead, bending her face back, as his way\nwas, and leaning over so that his head loomed black between her eyes and\nthe paleness of the sky, in which the white star floated...\n\nSide by side they sped back along the dark wood-road to the village. A\nlate moon was rising, full orbed and fiery, turning the mountain ranges\nfrom fluid gray to a massive blackness, and making the upper sky so\nlight that the stars looked as faint as their own reflections in water.\nAt the edge of the wood, half a mile from North Dormer, Harney jumped\nfrom his bicycle, took Charity in his arms for a last kiss, and then\nwaited while she went on alone.\n\nThey were later than usual, and instead of taking the bicycle to the\nlibrary she propped it against the back of the wood-shed and entered the\nkitchen of the red house. Verena sat there alone; when Charity came in\nshe looked at her with mild impenetrable eyes and then took a plate\nand a glass of milk from the shelf and set them silently on the table.\nCharity nodded her thanks, and sitting down, fell hungrily upon her\npiece of pie and emptied the glass. Her face burned with her quick\nflight through the night, and her eyes were dazzled by the twinkle of\nthe kitchen lamp. She felt like a night-bird suddenly caught and caged.\n\n“He ain't come back since supper,” Verena said. “He's down to the Hall.”\n\nCharity took no notice. Her soul was still winging through the forest.\nShe washed her plate and tumbler, and then felt her way up the dark\nstairs. When she opened her door a wonder arrested her. Before going\nout she had closed her shutters against the afternoon heat, but they had\nswung partly open, and a bar of moonlight, crossing the room, rested\non her bed and showed a dress of China silk laid out on it in virgin\nwhiteness. Charity had spent more than she could afford on the dress,\nwhich was to surpass those of all the other girls; she had wanted to let\nNorth Dormer see that she was worthy of Harney's admiration. Above the\ndress, folded on the pillow, was the white veil which the young women\nwho took part in the exercises were to wear under a wreath of asters;\nand beside the veil a pair of slim white satin shoes that Ally had\nproduced from an old trunk in which she stored mysterious treasures.\n\nCharity stood gazing at all the outspread whiteness. It recalled a\nvision that had come to her in the night after her first meeting with\nHarney. She no longer had such visions... warmer splendours had displaced\nthem... but it was stupid of Ally to have paraded all those white things\non her bed, exactly as Hattie Targatt's wedding dress from Springfield\nhad been spread out for the neighbours to see when she married Tom\nFry....\n\nCharity took up the satin shoes and looked at them curiously. By day, no\ndoubt, they would appear a little worn, but in the moonlight they seemed\ncarved of ivory. She sat down on the floor to try them on, and they\nfitted her perfectly, though when she stood up she lurched a little on\nthe high heels. She looked down at her feet, which the graceful mould\nof the slippers had marvellously arched and narrowed. She had never\nseen such shoes before, even in the shop-windows at Nettleton... never,\nexcept... yes, once, she had noticed a pair of the same shape on Annabel\nBalch.\n\nA blush of mortification swept over her. Ally sometimes sewed for Miss\nBalch when that brilliant being descended on North Dormer, and no\ndoubt she picked up presents of cast-off clothing: the treasures in the\nmysterious trunk all came from the people she worked for; there could be\nno doubt that the white slippers were Annabel Balch's....\n\nAs she stood there, staring down moodily at her feet, she heard the\ntriple click-click-click of a bicycle-bell under her window. It was\nHarney's secret signal as he passed on his way home. She stumbled to\nthe window on her high heels, flung open the shutters and leaned out. He\nwaved to her and sped by, his black shadow dancing merrily ahead of him\ndown the empty moonlit road; and she leaned there watching him till he\nvanished under the Hatchard spruces.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nTHE Town Hall was crowded and exceedingly hot. As Charity marched into\nit third in the white muslin file headed by Orma Fry, she was conscious\nmainly of the brilliant effect of the wreathed columns framing the\ngreen-carpeted stage toward which she was moving; and of the unfamiliar\nfaces turning from the front rows to watch the advance of the\nprocession.\n\nBut it was all a bewildering blur of eyes and colours till she found\nherself standing at the back of the stage, her great bunch of asters and\ngoldenrod held well in front of her, and answering the nervous glance\nof Lambert Sollas, the organist from Mr. Miles's church, who had come up\nfrom Nettleton to play the harmonium and sat behind it, his conductor's\neye running over the fluttered girls.\n\nA moment later Mr. Miles, pink and twinkling, emerged from the\nbackground, as if buoyed up on his broad white gown, and briskly\ndominated the bowed heads in the front rows. He prayed energetically and\nbriefly and then retired, and a fierce nod from Lambert Sollas warned\nthe girls that they were to follow at once with “Home, Sweet Home.” It\nwas a joy to Charity to sing: it seemed as though, for the first time,\nher secret rapture might burst from her and flash its defiance at the\nworld. All the glow in her blood, the breath of the summer earth,\nthe rustle of the forest, the fresh call of birds at sunrise, and the\nbrooding midday languors, seemed to pass into her untrained voice,\nlifted and led by the sustaining chorus.\n\nAnd then suddenly the song was over, and after an uncertain pause,\nduring which Miss Hatchard's pearl-grey gloves started a furtive\nsignalling down the hall, Mr. Royall, emerging in turn, ascended the\nsteps of the stage and appeared behind the flower-wreathed desk. He\npassed close to Charity, and she noticed that his gravely set face wore\nthe look of majesty that used to awe and fascinate her childhood. His\nfrock-coat had been carefully brushed and ironed, and the ends of his\nnarrow black tie were so nearly even that the tying must have cost him\na protracted struggle. His appearance struck her all the more because it\nwas the first time she had looked him full in the face since the night\nat Nettleton, and nothing in his grave and impressive demeanour revealed\na trace of the lamentable figure on the wharf.\n\nHe stood a moment behind the desk, resting his finger-tips against it,\nand bending slightly toward his audience; then he straightened himself\nand began.\n\nAt first she paid no heed to what he was saying: only fragments of\nsentences, sonorous quotations, allusions to illustrious men,\nincluding the obligatory tribute to Honorius Hatchard, drifted past her\ninattentive ears. She was trying to discover Harney among the notable\npeople in the front row; but he was nowhere near Miss Hatchard, who,\ncrowned by a pearl-grey hat that matched her gloves, sat just below the\ndesk, supported by Mrs. Miles and an important-looking unknown lady.\nCharity was near one end of the stage, and from where she sat the other\nend of the first row of seats was cut off by the screen of foliage\nmasking the harmonium. The effort to see Harney around the corner of the\nscreen, or through its interstices, made her unconscious of everything\nelse; but the effort was unsuccessful, and gradually she found her\nattention arrested by her guardian's discourse.\n\nShe had never heard him speak in public before, but she was familiar\nwith the rolling music of his voice when he read aloud, or held forth\nto the selectmen about the stove at Carrick Fry's. Today his inflections\nwere richer and graver than she had ever known them: he spoke slowly,\nwith pauses that seemed to invite his hearers to silent participation in\nhis thought; and Charity perceived a light of response in their faces.\n\nHe was nearing the end of his address... “Most of you,” he said, “most of\nyou who have returned here today, to take contact with this little place\nfor a brief hour, have come only on a pious pilgrimage, and will go back\npresently to busy cities and lives full of larger duties. But that is\nnot the only way of coming back to North Dormer. Some of us, who went\nout from here in our youth... went out, like you, to busy cities and\nlarger duties... have come back in another way--come back for good. I am\none of those, as many of you know....” He paused, and there was a sense\nof suspense in the listening hall. “My history is without interest, but\nit has its lesson: not so much for those of you who have already\nmade your lives in other places, as for the young men who are perhaps\nplanning even now to leave these quiet hills and go down into the\nstruggle. Things they cannot foresee may send some of those young men\nback some day to the little township and the old homestead: they may\ncome back for good....” He looked about him, and repeated gravely: “For\nGOOD. There's the point I want to make... North Dormer is a poor little\nplace, almost lost in a mighty landscape: perhaps, by this time, it\nmight have been a bigger place, and more in scale with the landscape,\nif those who had to come back had come with that feeling in their\nminds--that they wanted to come back for GOOD... and not for bad... or\njust for indifference....\n\n“Gentlemen, let us look at things as they are. Some of us have come back\nto our native town because we'd failed to get on elsewhere. One way or\nother, things had gone wrong with us... what we'd dreamed of hadn't come\ntrue. But the fact that we had failed elsewhere is no reason why we\nshould fail here. Our very experiments in larger places, even if they\nwere unsuccessful, ought to have helped us to make North Dormer a larger\nplace... and you young men who are preparing even now to follow the call\nof ambition, and turn your back on the old homes--well, let me say this\nto you, that if ever you do come back to them it's worth while to come\nback to them for their good.... And to do that, you must keep on loving\nthem while you're away from them; and even if you come back against your\nwill--and thinking it's all a bitter mistake of Fate or Providence--you\nmust try to make the best of it, and to make the best of your old town;\nand after a while--well, ladies and gentlemen, I give you my recipe for\nwhat it's worth; after a while, I believe you'll be able to say, as I\ncan say today: 'I'm glad I'm here.' Believe me, all of you, the best way\nto help the places we live in is to be glad we live there.”\n\nHe stopped, and a murmur of emotion and surprise ran through the\naudience. It was not in the least what they had expected, but it moved\nthem more than what they had expected would have moved them. “Hear,\nhear!” a voice cried out in the middle of the hall. An outburst of\ncheers caught up the cry, and as they subsided Charity heard Mr. Miles\nsaying to someone near him: “That was a MAN talking----” He wiped his\nspectacles.\n\nMr. Royall had stepped back from the desk, and taken his seat in the row\nof chairs in front of the harmonium. A dapper white-haired gentleman--a\ndistant Hatchard--succeeded him behind the goldenrod, and began to\nsay beautiful things about the old oaken bucket, patient white-haired\nmothers, and where the boys used to go nutting... and Charity began again\nto search for Harney....\n\nSuddenly Mr. Royall pushed back his seat, and one of the maple branches\nin front of the harmonium collapsed with a crash. It uncovered the end\nof the first row and in one of the seats Charity saw Harney, and in the\nnext a lady whose face was turned toward him, and almost hidden by the\nbrim of her drooping hat. Charity did not need to see the face. She knew\nat a glance the slim figure, the fair hair heaped up under the hat-brim,\nthe long pale wrinkled gloves with bracelets slipping over them. At the\nfall of the branch Miss Balch turned her head toward the stage, and in\nher pretty thin-lipped smile there lingered the reflection of something\nher neighbour had been whispering to her....\n\nSomeone came forward to replace the fallen branch, and Miss Balch and\nHarney were once more hidden. But to Charity the vision of their two\nfaces had blotted out everything. In a flash they had shown her the\nbare reality of her situation. Behind the frail screen of her lover's\ncaresses was the whole inscrutable mystery of his life: his relations\nwith other people--with other women--his opinions, his prejudices, his\nprinciples, the net of influences and interests and ambitions in which\nevery man's life is entangled. Of all these she knew nothing, except\nwhat he had told her of his architectural aspirations. She had always\ndimly guessed him to be in touch with important people, involved in\ncomplicated relations--but she felt it all to be so far beyond her\nunderstanding that the whole subject hung like a luminous mist on the\nfarthest verge of her thoughts. In the foreground, hiding all else,\nthere was the glow of his presence, the light and shadow of his face,\nthe way his short-sighted eyes, at her approach, widened and deepened\nas if to draw her down into them; and, above all, the flush of youth and\ntenderness in which his words enclosed her.\n\nNow she saw him detached from her, drawn back into the unknown, and\nwhispering to another girl things that provoked the same smile of\nmischievous complicity he had so often called to her own lips. The\nfeeling possessing her was not one of jealousy: she was too sure of\nhis love. It was rather a terror of the unknown, of all the mysterious\nattractions that must even now be dragging him away from her, and of her\nown powerlessness to contend with them.\n\nShe had given him all she had--but what was it compared to the other\ngifts life held for him? She understood now the case of girls like\nherself to whom this kind of thing happened. They gave all they had, but\ntheir all was not enough: it could not buy more than a few moments....\n\nThe heat had grown suffocating--she felt it descend on her in smothering\nwaves, and the faces in the crowded hall began to dance like the\npictures flashed on the screen at Nettleton. For an instant Mr. Royall's\ncountenance detached itself from the general blur. He had resumed his\nplace in front of the harmonium, and sat close to her, his eyes on her\nface; and his look seemed to pierce to the very centre of her confused\nsensations.... A feeling of physical sickness rushed over her--and then\ndeadly apprehension. The light of the fiery hours in the little house\nswept back on her in a glare of fear....\n\nShe forced herself to look away from her guardian, and became aware that\nthe oratory of the Hatchard cousin had ceased, and that Mr. Miles was\nagain flapping his wings. Fragments of his peroration floated through\nher bewildered brain.... “A rich harvest of hallowed memories.... A\nsanctified hour to which, in moments of trial, your thoughts will\nprayerfully return.... And now, O Lord, let us humbly and fervently give\nthanks for this blessed day of reunion, here in the old home to which we\nhave come back from so far. Preserve it to us, O Lord, in times to come,\nin all its homely sweetness--in the kindliness and wisdom of its old\npeople, in the courage and industry of its young men, in the piety and\npurity of this group of innocent girls----” He flapped a white wing in\ntheir direction, and at the same moment Lambert Sollas, with his fierce\nnod, struck the opening bars of “Auld Lang Syne.” ...Charity stared\nstraight ahead of her and then, dropping her flowers, fell face downward\nat Mr. Royall's feet.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nNORTH DORMER'S celebration naturally included the villages attached to\nits township, and the festivities were to radiate over the whole group,\nfrom Dormer and the two Crestons to Hamblin, the lonely hamlet on the\nnorth slope of the Mountain where the first snow always fell. On the\nthird day there were speeches and ceremonies at Creston and Creston\nRiver; on the fourth the principal performers were to be driven in\nbuck-boards to Dormer and Hamblin.\n\nIt was on the fourth day that Charity returned for the first time to the\nlittle house. She had not seen Harney alone since they had parted at the\nwood's edge the night before the celebrations began. In the interval she\nhad passed through many moods, but for the moment the terror which had\nseized her in the Town Hall had faded to the edge of consciousness.\nShe had fainted because the hall was stiflingly hot, and because the\nspeakers had gone on and on.... Several other people had been affected by\nthe heat, and had had to leave before the exercises were over. There had\nbeen thunder in the air all the afternoon, and everyone said afterward\nthat something ought to have been done to ventilate the hall....\n\nAt the dance that evening--where she had gone reluctantly, and only\nbecause she feared to stay away, she had sprung back into instant\nreassurance. As soon as she entered she had seen Harney waiting for her,\nand he had come up with kind gay eyes, and swept her off in a waltz. Her\nfeet were full of music, and though her only training had been with the\nvillage youths she had no difficulty in tuning her steps to his. As they\ncircled about the floor all her vain fears dropped from her, and she\neven forgot that she was probably dancing in Annabel Balch's slippers.\n\nWhen the waltz was over Harney, with a last hand-clasp, left her to\nmeet Miss Hatchard and Miss Balch, who were just entering. Charity had\na moment of anguish as Miss Balch appeared; but it did not last. The\ntriumphant fact of her own greater beauty, and of Harney's sense of\nit, swept her apprehensions aside. Miss Balch, in an unbecoming dress,\nlooked sallow and pinched, and Charity fancied there was a worried\nexpression in her pale-lashed eyes. She took a seat near Miss Hatchard\nand it was presently apparent that she did not mean to dance. Charity\ndid not dance often either. Harney explained to her that Miss Hatchard\nhad begged him to give each of the other girls a turn; but he went\nthrough the form of asking Charity's permission each time he led one\nout, and that gave her a sense of secret triumph even completer than\nwhen she was whirling about the room with him.\n\nShe was thinking of all this as she waited for him in the deserted\nhouse. The late afternoon was sultry, and she had tossed aside her hat\nand stretched herself at full length on the Mexican blanket because it\nwas cooler indoors than under the trees. She lay with her arms folded\nbeneath her head, gazing out at the shaggy shoulder of the Mountain. The\nsky behind it was full of the splintered glories of the descending sun,\nand before long she expected to hear Harney's bicycle-bell in the lane.\nHe had bicycled to Hamblin, instead of driving there with his cousin\nand her friends, so that he might be able to make his escape earlier\nand stop on the way back at the deserted house, which was on the road\nto Hamblin. They had smiled together at the joke of hearing the crowded\nbuck-boards roll by on the return, while they lay close in their\nhiding above the road. Such childish triumphs still gave her a sense of\nreckless security.\n\nNevertheless she had not wholly forgotten the vision of fear that had\nopened before her in the Town Hall. The sense of lastingness was gone\nfrom her and every moment with Harney would now be ringed with doubt.\n\nThe Mountain was turning purple against a fiery sunset from which it\nseemed to be divided by a knife-edge of quivering light; and above\nthis wall of flame the whole sky was a pure pale green, like some cold\nmountain lake in shadow. Charity lay gazing up at it, and watching for\nthe first white star....\n\nHer eyes were still fixed on the upper reaches of the sky when she\nbecame aware that a shadow had flitted across the glory-flooded room: it\nmust have been Harney passing the window against the sunset.... She half\nraised herself, and then dropped back on her folded arms. The combs had\nslipped from her hair, and it trailed in a rough dark rope across her\nbreast. She lay quite still, a sleepy smile on her lips, her indolent\nlids half shut. There was a fumbling at the padlock and she called out:\n“Have you slipped the chain?” The door opened, and Mr. Royall walked\ninto the room.\n\nShe started up, sitting back against the cushions, and they looked at\neach other without speaking. Then Mr. Royall closed the door-latch and\nadvanced a few steps.\n\nCharity jumped to her feet. “What have you come for?” she stammered.\n\nThe last glare of the sunset was on her guardian's face, which looked\nash-coloured in the yellow radiance.\n\n“Because I knew you were here,” he answered simply.\n\nShe had become conscious of the hair hanging loose across her breast,\nand it seemed as though she could not speak to him till she had set\nherself in order. She groped for her comb, and tried to fasten up the\ncoil. Mr. Royall silently watched her.\n\n“Charity,” he said, “he'll be here in a minute. Let me talk to you\nfirst.”\n\n“You've got no right to talk to me. I can do what I please.”\n\n“Yes. What is it you mean to do?”\n\n“I needn't answer that, or anything else.”\n\nHe had glanced away, and stood looking curiously about the illuminated\nroom. Purple asters and red maple-leaves filled the jar on the table; on\na shelf against the wall stood a lamp, the kettle, a little pile of cups\nand saucers. The canvas chairs were grouped about the table.\n\n“So this is where you meet,” he said.\n\nHis tone was quiet and controlled, and the fact disconcerted her.\nShe had been ready to give him violence for violence, but this calm\nacceptance of things as they were left her without a weapon.\n\n“See here, Charity--you're always telling me I've got no rights over\nyou. There might be two ways of looking at that--but I ain't going\nto argue it. All I know is I raised you as good as I could, and meant\nfairly by you always except once, for a bad half-hour. There's no\njustice in weighing that half-hour against the rest, and you know it. If\nyou hadn't, you wouldn't have gone on living under my roof. Seems to me\nthe fact of your doing that gives me some sort of a right; the right\nto try and keep you out of trouble. I'm not asking you to consider any\nother.”\n\nShe listened in silence, and then gave a slight laugh. “Better wait till\nI'm in trouble,” she said. He paused a moment, as if weighing her words.\n“Is that all your answer?”\n\n“Yes, that's all.”\n\n“Well--I'll wait.”\n\nHe turned away slowly, but as he did so the thing she had been waiting\nfor happened; the door opened again and Harney entered.\n\nHe stopped short with a face of astonishment, and then, quickly\ncontrolling himself, went up to Mr. Royall with a frank look.\n\n“Have you come to see me, sir?” he said coolly, throwing his cap on the\ntable with an air of proprietorship.\n\nMr. Royall again looked slowly about the room; then his eyes turned to\nthe young man.\n\n“Is this your house?” he inquired.\n\nHarney laughed: “Well--as much as it's anybody's. I come here to sketch\noccasionally.”\n\n“And to receive Miss Royall's visits?”\n\n“When she does me the honour----”\n\n“Is this the home you propose to bring her to when you get married?”\n\nThere was an immense and oppressive silence. Charity, quivering with\nanger, started forward, and then stood silent, too humbled for speech.\nHarney's eyes had dropped under the old man's gaze; but he raised them\npresently, and looking steadily at Mr. Royall, said: “Miss Royall is not\na child. Isn't it rather absurd to talk of her as if she were? I believe\nshe considers herself free to come and go as she pleases, without any\nquestions from anyone.” He paused and added: “I'm ready to answer any\nshe wishes to ask me.”\n\nMr. Royall turned to her. “Ask him when he's going to marry you,\nthen----” There was another silence, and he laughed in his turn--a\nbroken laugh, with a scraping sound in it. “You darsn't!” he shouted out\nwith sudden passion. He went close up to Charity, his right arm lifted,\nnot in menace but in tragic exhortation.\n\n“You darsn't, and you know it--and you know why!” He swung back again\nupon the young man. “And you know why you ain't asked her to marry you,\nand why you don't mean to. It's because you hadn't need to; nor any\nother man either. I'm the only one that was fool enough not to know\nthat; and I guess nobody'll repeat my mistake--not in Eagle County,\nanyhow. They all know what she is, and what she came from. They all know\nher mother was a woman of the town from Nettleton, that followed one of\nthose Mountain fellows up to his place and lived there with him like a\nheathen. I saw her there sixteen years ago, when I went to bring this\nchild down. I went to save her from the kind of life her mother was\nleading--but I'd better have left her in the kennel she came from....”\n He paused and stared darkly at the two young people, and out beyond\nthem, at the menacing Mountain with its rim of fire; then he sat down\nbeside the table on which they had so often spread their rustic supper,\nand covered his face with his hands. Harney leaned in the window, a\nfrown on his face: he was twirling between his fingers a small package\nthat dangled from a loop of string.... Charity heard Mr. Royall draw a\nhard breath or two, and his shoulders shook a little. Presently he\nstood up and walked across the room. He did not look again at the young\npeople: they saw him feel his way to the door and fumble for the latch;\nand then he went out into the darkness.\n\nAfter he had gone there was a long silence. Charity waited for Harney to\nspeak; but he seemed at first not to find anything to say. At length he\nbroke out irrelevantly: “I wonder how he found out?”\n\nShe made no answer and he tossed down the package he had been holding,\nand went up to her.\n\n“I'm so sorry, dear... that this should have happened....”\n\nShe threw her head back proudly. “I ain't ever been sorry--not a\nminute!”\n\n“No.”\n\nShe waited to be caught into his arms, but he turned away from\nher irresolutely. The last glow was gone from behind the Mountain.\nEverything in the room had turned grey and indistinct, and an autumnal\ndampness crept up from the hollow below the orchard, laying its cold\ntouch on their flushed faces. Harney walked the length of the room, and\nthen turned back and sat down at the table.\n\n“Come,” he said imperiously.\n\nShe sat down beside him, and he untied the string about the package and\nspread out a pile of sandwiches.\n\n“I stole them from the love-feast at Hamblin,” he said with a laugh,\npushing them over to her. She laughed too, and took one, and began to\neat.\n\n“Didn't you make the tea?”\n\n“No,” she said. “I forgot----”\n\n“Oh, well--it's too late to boil the water now.” He said nothing more,\nand sitting opposite to each other they went on silently eating the\nsandwiches. Darkness had descended in the little room, and Harney's face\nwas a dim blur to Charity. Suddenly he leaned across the table and laid\nhis hand on hers.\n\n“I shall have to go off for a while--a month or two, perhaps--to arrange\nsome things; and then I'll come back... and we'll get married.”\n\nHis voice seemed like a stranger's: nothing was left in it of the\nvibrations she knew. Her hand lay inertly under his, and she left it\nthere, and raised her head, trying to answer him. But the words died\nin her throat. They sat motionless, in their attitude of confident\nendearment, as if some strange death had surprised them. At length\nHarney sprang to his feet with a slight shiver. “God! it's damp--we\ncouldn't have come here much longer.” He went to the shelf, took down a\ntin candle-stick and lit the candle; then he propped an unhinged shutter\nagainst the empty window-frame and put the candle on the table. It threw\na queer shadow on his frowning forehead, and made the smile on his lips\na grimace.\n\n“But it's been good, though, hasn't it, Charity?... What's the\nmatter--why do you stand there staring at me? Haven't the days here been\ngood?” He went up to her and caught her to his breast. “And there'll be\nothers--lots of others... jollier... even jollier... won't there,\ndarling?”\n\nHe turned her head back, feeling for the curve of her throat below the\near, and kissing here there, and on the hair and eyes and lips. She\nclung to him desperately, and as he drew her to his knees on the couch\nshe felt as if they were being sucked down together into some bottomless\nabyss.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nThat night, as usual, they said good-bye at the wood's edge.\n\nHarney was to leave the next morning early. He asked Charity to say\nnothing of their plans till his return, and, strangely even to herself,\nshe was glad of the postponement. A leaden weight of shame hung on her,\nbenumbing every other sensation, and she bade him good-bye with hardly\na sign of emotion. His reiterated promises to return seemed almost\nwounding. She had no doubt that he intended to come back; her doubts\nwere far deeper and less definable.\n\nSince the fanciful vision of the future that had flitted through her\nimagination at their first meeting she had hardly ever thought of his\nmarrying her. She had not had to put the thought from her mind; it had\nnot been there. If ever she looked ahead she felt instinctively that the\ngulf between them was too deep, and that the bridge their passion had\nflung across it was as insubstantial as a rainbow. But she seldom\nlooked ahead; each day was so rich that it absorbed her.... Now her first\nfeeling was that everything would be different, and that she herself\nwould be a different being to Harney. Instead of remaining separate and\nabsolute, she would be compared with other people, and unknown things\nwould be expected of her. She was too proud to be afraid, but the\nfreedom of her spirit drooped....\n\nHarney had not fixed any date for his return; he had said he would have\nto look about first, and settle things. He had promised to write as soon\nas there was anything definite to say, and had left her his address, and\nasked her to write also. But the address frightened her. It was in New\nYork, at a club with a long name in Fifth Avenue: it seemed to raise an\ninsurmountable barrier between them. Once or twice, in the first days,\nshe got out a sheet of paper, and sat looking at it, and trying to think\nwhat to say; but she had the feeling that her letter would never reach\nits destination. She had never written to anyone farther away than\nHepburn.\n\nHarney's first letter came after he had been gone about ten days. It was\ntender but grave, and bore no resemblance to the gay little notes he had\nsent her by the freckled boy from Creston River. He spoke positively of\nhis intention of coming back, but named no date, and reminded Charity of\ntheir agreement that their plans should not be divulged till he had had\ntime to “settle things.” When that would be he could not yet foresee;\nbut she could count on his returning as soon as the way was clear.\n\nShe read the letter with a strange sense of its coming from immeasurable\ndistances and having lost most of its meaning on the way; and in reply\nshe sent him a coloured postcard of Creston Falls, on which she wrote:\n“With love from Charity.” She felt the pitiful inadequacy of this, and\nunderstood, with a sense of despair, that in her inability to express\nherself she must give him an impression of coldness and reluctance; but\nshe could not help it. She could not forget that he had never spoken\nto her of marriage till Mr. Royall had forced the word from his lips;\nthough she had not had the strength to shake off the spell that bound\nher to him she had lost all spontaneity of feeling, and seemed to\nherself to be passively awaiting a fate she could not avert.\n\nShe had not seen Mr. Royall on her return to the red house. The morning\nafter her parting from Harney, when she came down from her room, Verena\ntold her that her guardian had gone off to Worcester and Portland. It\nwas the time of year when he usually reported to the insurance agencies\nhe represented, and there was nothing unusual in his departure except\nits suddenness. She thought little about him, except to be glad he was\nnot there....\n\nShe kept to herself for the first days, while North Dormer was\nrecovering from its brief plunge into publicity, and the subsiding\nagitation left her unnoticed. But the faithful Ally could not be long\navoided. For the first few days after the close of the Old Home Week\nfestivities Charity escaped her by roaming the hills all day when she\nwas not at her post in the library; but after that a period of rain set\nin, and one pouring afternoon, Ally, sure that she would find her friend\nindoors, came around to the red house with her sewing.\n\nThe two girls sat upstairs in Charity's room. Charity, her idle hands in\nher lap, was sunk in a kind of leaden dream, through which she was only\nhalf-conscious of Ally, who sat opposite her in a low rush-bottomed\nchair, her work pinned to her knee, and her thin lips pursed up as she\nbent above it.\n\n“It was my idea running a ribbon through the gauging,” she said proudly,\ndrawing back to contemplate the blouse she was trimming. “It's for Miss\nBalch: she was awfully pleased.” She paused and then added, with a queer\ntremor in her piping voice: “I darsn't have told her I got the idea from\none I saw on Julia.”\n\nCharity raised her eyes listlessly. “Do you still see Julia sometimes?”\n\nAlly reddened, as if the allusion had escaped her unintentionally. “Oh,\nit was a long time ago I seen her with those gaugings....”\n\nSilence fell again, and Ally presently continued: “Miss Balch left me a\nwhole lot of things to do over this time.”\n\n“Why--has she gone?” Charity inquired with an inner start of\napprehension.\n\n“Didn't you know? She went off the morning after they had the\ncelebration at Hamblin. I seen her drive by early with Mr. Harney.”\n\nThere was another silence, measured by the steady tick of the rain\nagainst the window, and, at intervals, by the snipping sound of Ally's\nscissors.\n\nAlly gave a meditative laugh. “Do you know what she told me before she\nwent away? She told me she was going to send for me to come over to\nSpringfield and make some things for her wedding.”\n\nCharity again lifted her heavy lids and stared at Ally's pale pointed\nface, which moved to and fro above her moving fingers.\n\n“Is she going to get married?”\n\nAlly let the blouse sink to her knee, and sat gazing at it. Her lips\nseemed suddenly dry, and she moistened them a little with her tongue.\n\n“Why, I presume so... from what she said.... Didn't you know?”\n\n“Why should I know?”\n\nAlly did not answer. She bent above the blouse, and began picking out a\nbasting thread with the point of the scissors.\n\n“Why should I know?” Charity repeated harshly.\n\n“I didn't know but what... folks here say she's engaged to Mr. Harney.”\n\nCharity stood up with a laugh, and stretched her arms lazily above her\nhead.\n\n“If all the people got married that folks say are going to you'd have\nyour time full making wedding-dresses,” she said ironically.\n\n“Why--don't you believe it?” Ally ventured.\n\n“It would not make it true if I did--nor prevent it if I didn't.”\n\n“That's so.... I only know I seen her crying the night of the party\nbecause her dress didn't set right. That was why she wouldn't dance\nany....”\n\nCharity stood absently gazing down at the lacy garment on Ally's knee.\nAbruptly she stooped and snatched it up.\n\n“Well, I guess she won't dance in this either,” she said with sudden\nviolence; and grasping the blouse in her strong young hands she tore it\nin two and flung the tattered bits to the floor.\n\n“Oh, Charity----” Ally cried, springing up. For a long interval the two\ngirls faced each other across the ruined garment. Ally burst into tears.\n\n“Oh, what'll I say to her? What'll I do? It was real lace!” she wailed\nbetween her piping sobs.\n\nCharity glared at her unrelentingly. “You'd oughtn't to have brought it\nhere,” she said, breathing quickly. “I hate other people's clothes--it's\njust as if they was there themselves.” The two stared at each other\nagain over this avowal, till Charity brought out, in a gasp of anguish:\n“Oh, go--go--go--or I'll hate you too....”\n\nWhen Ally left her, she fell sobbing across her bed.\n\nThe long storm was followed by a north-west gale, and when it was over,\nthe hills took on their first umber tints, the sky grew more densely\nblue, and the big white clouds lay against the hills like snow-banks.\nThe first crisp maple-leaves began to spin across Miss Hatchard's lawn,\nand the Virginia creeper on the Memorial splashed the white porch with\nscarlet. It was a golden triumphant September. Day by day the flame of\nthe Virginia creeper spread to the hillsides in wider waves of carmine\nand crimson, the larches glowed like the thin yellow halo about a fire,\nthe maples blazed and smouldered, and the black hemlocks turned to\nindigo against the incandescence of the forest.\n\nThe nights were cold, with a dry glitter of stars so high up that they\nseemed smaller and more vivid. Sometimes, as Charity lay sleepless on\nher bed through the long hours, she felt as though she were bound to\nthose wheeling fires and swinging with them around the great black\nvault. At night she planned many things... it was then she wrote to\nHarney. But the letters were never put on paper, for she did not know\nhow to express what she wanted to tell him. So she waited. Since her\ntalk with Ally she had felt sure that Harney was engaged to Annabel\nBalch, and that the process of “settling things” would involve the\nbreaking of this tie. Her first rage of jealousy over, she felt no fear\non this score. She was still sure that Harney would come back, and she\nwas equally sure that, for the moment at least, it was she whom he loved\nand not Miss Balch. Yet the girl, no less, remained a rival, since she\nrepresented all the things that Charity felt herself most incapable of\nunderstanding or achieving. Annabel Balch was, if not the girl Harney\nought to marry, at least the kind of girl it would be natural for him to\nmarry. Charity had never been able to picture herself as his wife; had\nnever been able to arrest the vision and follow it out in its daily\nconsequences; but she could perfectly imagine Annabel Balch in that\nrelation to him.\n\nThe more she thought of these things the more the sense of fatality\nweighed on her: she felt the uselessness of struggling against the\ncircumstances. She had never known how to adapt herself; she could only\nbreak and tear and destroy. The scene with Ally had left her stricken\nwith shame at her own childish savagery. What would Harney have thought\nif he had witnessed it? But when she turned the incident over in her\npuzzled mind she could not imagine what a civilized person would have\ndone in her place. She felt herself too unequally pitted against unknown\nforces....\n\nAt length this feeling moved her to sudden action. She took a sheet of\nletter paper from Mr. Royall's office, and sitting by the kitchen\nlamp, one night after Verena had gone to bed, began her first letter to\nHarney. It was very short:\n\n\nI want you should marry Annabel Balch if you promised to. I think maybe\nyou were afraid I'd feel too bad about it. I feel I'd rather you acted\nright. Your loving CHARITY.\n\n\nShe posted the letter early the next morning, and for a few days her\nheart felt strangely light. Then she began to wonder why she received no\nanswer.\n\nOne day as she sat alone in the library pondering these things the walls\nof books began to spin around her, and the rosewood desk to rock under\nher elbows. The dizziness was followed by a wave of nausea like that she\nhad felt on the day of the exercises in the Town Hall. But the Town Hall\nhad been crowded and stiflingly hot, and the library was empty, and so\nchilly that she had kept on her jacket. Five minutes before she had felt\nperfectly well; and now it seemed as if she were going to die. The bit\nof lace at which she still languidly worked dropped from her fingers,\nand the steel crochet hook clattered to the floor. She pressed her\ntemples hard between her damp hands, steadying herself against the desk\nwhile the wave of sickness swept over her. Little by little it subsided,\nand after a few minutes she stood up, shaken and terrified, groped for\nher hat, and stumbled out into the air. But the whole sunlit autumn\nwhirled, reeled and roared around her as she dragged herself along the\ninterminable length of the road home.\n\nAs she approached the red house she saw a buggy standing at the door,\nand her heart gave a leap. But it was only Mr. Royall who got out, his\ntravelling-bag in hand. He saw her coming, and waited in the porch.\nShe was conscious that he was looking at her intently, as if there was\nsomething strange in her appearance, and she threw back her head with a\ndesperate effort at ease. Their eyes met, and she said: “You back?” as\nif nothing had happened, and he answered: “Yes, I'm back,” and walked\nin ahead of her, pushing open the door of his office. She climbed to\nher room, every step of the stairs holding her fast as if her feet were\nlined with glue.\n\nTwo days later, she descended from the train at Nettleton, and walked\nout of the station into the dusty square. The brief interval of cold\nweather was over, and the day was as soft, and almost as hot, as when\nshe and Harney had emerged on the same scene on the Fourth of July. In\nthe square the same broken-down hacks and carry-alls stood drawn up in\na despondent line, and the lank horses with fly-nets over their withers\nswayed their heads drearily to and fro. She recognized the staring signs\nover the eating-houses and billiard saloons, and the long lines of wires\non lofty poles tapering down the main street to the park at its other\nend. Taking the way the wires pointed, she went on hastily, with bent\nhead, till she reached a wide transverse street with a brick building\nat the corner. She crossed this street and glanced furtively up at\nthe front of the brick building; then she returned, and entered a door\nopening on a flight of steep brass-rimmed stairs. On the second landing\nshe rang a bell, and a mulatto girl with a bushy head and a frilled\napron let her into a hall where a stuffed fox on his hind legs proffered\na brass card-tray to visitors. At the back of the hall was a glazed door\nmarked: “Office.” After waiting a few minutes in a handsomely furnished\nroom, with plush sofas surmounted by large gold-framed photographs of\nshowy young women, Charity was shown into the office....\n\nWhen she came out of the glazed door Dr. Merkle followed, and led her\ninto another room, smaller, and still more crowded with plush and gold\nframes. Dr. Merkle was a plump woman with small bright eyes, an immense\nmass of black hair coming down low on her forehead, and unnaturally\nwhite and even teeth. She wore a rich black dress, with gold chains\nand charms hanging from her bosom. Her hands were large and smooth, and\nquick in all their movements; and she smelt of musk and carbolic acid.\n\nShe smiled on Charity with all her faultless teeth. “Sit down, my\ndear. Wouldn't you like a little drop of something to pick you\nup?... No.... Well, just lay back a minute then.... There's nothing to\nbe done just yet; but in about a month, if you'll step round again... I\ncould take you right into my own house for two or three days, and there\nwouldn't be a mite of trouble. Mercy me! The next time you'll know\nbetter'n to fret like this....”\n\nCharity gazed at her with widening eyes. This woman with the false hair,\nthe false teeth, the false murderous smile--what was she offering her\nbut immunity from some unthinkable crime? Charity, till then, had\nbeen conscious only of a vague self-disgust and a frightening physical\ndistress; now, of a sudden, there came to her the grave surprise of\nmotherhood. She had come to this dreadful place because she knew of no\nother way of making sure that she was not mistaken about her state;\nand the woman had taken her for a miserable creature like Julia.... The\nthought was so horrible that she sprang up, white and shaking, one of\nher great rushes of anger sweeping over her.\n\nDr. Merkle, still smiling, also rose. “Why do you run off in such a\nhurry? You can stretch out right here on my sofa....” She paused, and\nher smile grew more motherly. “Afterwards--if there's been any talk at\nhome, and you want to get away for a while... I have a lady friend in\nBoston who's looking for a companion... you're the very one to suit her,\nmy dear....”\n\nCharity had reached the door. “I don't want to stay. I don't want to\ncome back here,” she stammered, her hand on the knob; but with a swift\nmovement, Dr. Merkle edged her from the threshold.\n\n“Oh, very well. Five dollars, please.”\n\nCharity looked helplessly at the doctor's tight lips and rigid face.\nHer last savings had gone in repaying Ally for the cost of Miss Balch's\nruined blouse, and she had had to borrow four dollars from her friend\nto pay for her railway ticket and cover the doctor's fee. It had never\noccurred to her that medical advice could cost more than two dollars.\n\n“I didn't know... I haven't got that much...” she faltered, bursting into\ntears.\n\nDr. Merkle gave a short laugh which did not show her teeth, and inquired\nwith concision if Charity supposed she ran the establishment for her own\namusement? She leaned her firm shoulders against the door as she spoke,\nlike a grim gaoler making terms with her captive.\n\n“You say you'll come round and settle later? I've heard that pretty\noften too. Give me your address, and if you can't pay me I'll send the\nbill to your folks.... What? I can't understand what you say.... That\ndon't suit you either? My, you're pretty particular for a girl that\nain't got enough to settle her own bills....” She paused, and fixed\nher eyes on the brooch with a blue stone that Charity had pinned to her\nblouse.\n\n“Ain't you ashamed to talk that way to a lady that's got to earn her\nliving, when you go about with jewellery like that on you?... It ain't\nin my line, and I do it only as a favour... but if you're a mind to leave\nthat brooch as a pledge, I don't say no.... Yes, of course, you can get\nit back when you bring me my money....”\n\nOn the way home, she felt an immense and unexpected quietude. It had\nbeen horrible to have to leave Harney's gift in the woman's hands, but\neven at that price the news she brought away had not been too dearly\nbought. She sat with half-closed eyes as the train rushed through the\nfamiliar landscape; and now the memories of her former journey, instead\nof flying before her like dead leaves, seemed to be ripening in her\nblood like sleeping grain. She would never again know what it was to\nfeel herself alone. Everything seemed to have grown suddenly clear\nand simple. She no longer had any difficulty in picturing herself as\nHarney's wife now that she was the mother of his child; and compared to\nher sovereign right Annabel Balch's claim seemed no more than a girl's\nsentimental fancy.\n\nThat evening, at the gate of the red house, she found Ally waiting in\nthe dusk. “I was down at the post-office just as they were closing up,\nand Will Targatt said there was a letter for you, so I brought it.”\n\nAlly held out the letter, looking at Charity with piercing sympathy.\nSince the scene of the torn blouse there had been a new and fearful\nadmiration in the eyes she bent on her friend.\n\nCharity snatched the letter with a laugh. “Oh, thank you--good-night,”\n she called out over her shoulder as she ran up the path. If she had\nlingered a moment she knew she would have had Ally at her heels.\n\nShe hurried upstairs and felt her way into her dark room. Her hands\ntrembled as she groped for the matches and lit her candle, and the flap\nof the envelope was so closely stuck that she had to find her scissors\nand slit it open. At length she read:\n\n\nDEAR CHARITY:\n\nI have your letter, and it touches me more than I can say. Won't you\ntrust me, in return, to do my best? There are things it is hard to\nexplain, much less to justify; but your generosity makes everything\neasier. All I can do now is to thank you from my soul for understanding.\nYour telling me that you wanted me to do right has helped me beyond\nexpression. If ever there is a hope of realizing what we dreamed of you\nwill see me back on the instant; and I haven't yet lost that hope.\n\n\nShe read the letter with a rush; then she went over and over it, each\ntime more slowly and painstakingly. It was so beautifully expressed\nthat she found it almost as difficult to understand as the gentleman's\nexplanation of the Bible pictures at Nettleton; but gradually she became\naware that the gist of its meaning lay in the last few words. “If ever\nthere is a hope of realizing what we dreamed of...”\n\nBut then he wasn't even sure of that? She understood now that every word\nand every reticence was an avowal of Annabel Balch's prior claim. It was\ntrue that he was engaged to her, and that he had not yet found a way of\nbreaking his engagement.\n\nAs she read the letter over Charity understood what it must have cost\nhim to write it. He was not trying to evade an importunate claim; he was\nhonestly and contritely struggling between opposing duties. She did not\neven reproach him in her thoughts for having concealed from her that\nhe was not free: she could not see anything more reprehensible in his\nconduct than in her own. From the first she had needed him more than he\nhad wanted her, and the power that had swept them together had been\nas far beyond resistance as a great gale loosening the leaves of the\nforest.... Only, there stood between them, fixed and upright in the\ngeneral upheaval, the indestructible figure of Annabel Balch....\n\nFace to face with his admission of the fact, she sat staring at the\nletter. A cold tremor ran over her, and the hard sobs struggled up into\nher throat and shook her from head to foot. For a while she was caught\nand tossed on great waves of anguish that left her hardly conscious of\nanything but the blind struggle against their assaults. Then, little by\nlittle, she began to relive, with a dreadful poignancy, each separate\nstage of her poor romance. Foolish things she had said came back to her,\ngay answers Harney had made, his first kiss in the darkness between\nthe fireworks, their choosing the blue brooch together, the way he had\nteased her about the letters she had dropped in her flight from the\nevangelist. All these memories, and a thousand others, hummed through\nher brain till his nearness grew so vivid that she felt his fingers in\nher hair, and his warm breath on her cheek as he bent her head back like\na flower. These things were hers; they had passed into her blood, and\nbecome a part of her, they were building the child in her womb; it was\nimpossible to tear asunder strands of life so interwoven.\n\nThe conviction gradually strengthened her, and she began to form in her\nmind the first words of the letter she meant to write to Harney. She\nwanted to write it at once, and with feverish hands she began to rummage\nin her drawer for a sheet of letter paper. But there was none left; she\nmust go downstairs to get it. She had a superstitious feeling that the\nletter must be written on the instant, that setting down her secret in\nwords would bring her reassurance and safety; and taking up her candle\nshe went down to Mr. Royall's office.\n\nAt that hour she was not likely to find him there: he had probably had\nhis supper and walked over to Carrick Fry's. She pushed open the door of\nthe unlit room, and the light of her lifted candle fell on his figure,\nseated in the darkness in his high-backed chair. His arms lay along\nthe arms of the chair, and his head was bent a little; but he lifted\nit quickly as Charity entered. She started back as their eyes met,\nremembering that her own were red with weeping, and that her face was\nlivid with the fatigue and emotion of her journey. But it was too late\nto escape, and she stood and looked at him in silence.\n\nHe had risen from his chair, and came toward her with outstretched\nhands. The gesture was so unexpected that she let him take her hands in\nhis and they stood thus, without speaking, till Mr. Royall said gravely:\n“Charity--was you looking for me?”\n\nShe freed herself abruptly and fell back. “Me? No----” She set down the\ncandle on his desk. “I wanted some letter-paper, that's all.” His face\ncontracted, and the bushy brows jutted forward over his eyes. Without\nanswering he opened the drawer of the desk, took out a sheet of paper\nand an envelope, and pushed them toward her. “Do you want a stamp too?”\n he asked.\n\nShe nodded, and he gave her the stamp. As he did so she felt that he was\nlooking at her intently, and she knew that the candle light flickering\nup on her white face must be distorting her swollen features and\nexaggerating the dark rings about her eyes. She snatched up the paper,\nher reassurance dissolving under his pitiless gaze, in which she seemed\nto read the grim perception of her state, and the ironic recollection\nof the day when, in that very room, he had offered to compel Harney to\nmarry her. His look seemed to say that he knew she had taken the paper\nto write to her lover, who had left her as he had warned her she would\nbe left. She remembered the scorn with which she had turned from him\nthat day, and knew, if he guessed the truth, what a list of old scores\nit must settle. She turned and fled upstairs; but when she got back to\nher room all the words that had been waiting had vanished....\n\nIf she could have gone to Harney it would have been different; she would\nonly have had to show herself to let his memories speak for her. But\nshe had no money left, and there was no one from whom she could have\nborrowed enough for such a journey. There was nothing to do but to\nwrite, and await his reply. For a long time she sat bent above the blank\npage; but she found nothing to say that really expressed what she was\nfeeling....\n\nHarney had written that she had made it easier for him, and she was glad\nit was so; she did not want to make things hard. She knew she had it in\nher power to do that; she held his fate in her hands. All she had to\ndo was to tell him the truth; but that was the very fact that held her\nback.... Her five minutes face to face with Mr. Royall had stripped her\nof her last illusion, and brought her back to North Dormer's point of\nview. Distinctly and pitilessly there rose before her the fate of the\ngirl who was married “to make things right.” She had seen too many\nvillage love-stories end in that way. Poor Rose Coles's miserable\nmarriage was of the number; and what good had come of it for her or\nfor Halston Skeff? They had hated each other from the day the minister\nmarried them; and whenever old Mrs. Skeff had a fancy to humiliate her\ndaughter-in-law she had only to say: “Who'd ever think the baby's only\ntwo? And for a seven months' child--ain't it a wonder what a size he\nis?” North Dormer had treasures of indulgence for brands in the burning,\nbut only derision for those who succeeded in getting snatched from\nit; and Charity had always understood Julia Hawes's refusal to be\nsnatched....\n\nOnly--was there no alternative but Julia's? Her soul recoiled from the\nvision of the white-faced woman among the plush sofas and gilt frames.\nIn the established order of things as she knew them she saw no place for\nher individual adventure....\n\nShe sat in her chair without undressing till faint grey streaks began\nto divide the black slats of the shutters. Then she stood up and pushed\nthem open, letting in the light. The coming of a new day brought a\nsharper consciousness of ineluctable reality, and with it a sense of the\nneed of action. She looked at herself in the glass, and saw her face,\nwhite in the autumn dawn, with pinched cheeks and dark-ringed eyes, and\nall the marks of her state that she herself would never have noticed,\nbut that Dr. Merkle's diagnosis had made plain to her. She could not\nhope that those signs would escape the watchful village; even before her\nfigure lost its shape she knew her face would betray her.\n\nLeaning from her window she looked out on the dark and empty scene; the\nashen houses with shuttered windows, the grey road climbing the slope to\nthe hemlock belt above the cemetery, and the heavy mass of the Mountain\nblack against a rainy sky. To the east a space of light was broadening\nabove the forest; but over that also the clouds hung. Slowly her gaze\ntravelled across the fields to the rugged curve of the hills. She had\nlooked out so often on that lifeless circle, and wondered if anything\ncould ever happen to anyone who was enclosed in it....\n\nAlmost without conscious thought her decision had been reached; as her\neyes had followed the circle of the hills her mind had also travelled\nthe old round. She supposed it was something in her blood that made the\nMountain the only answer to her questioning, the inevitable escape\nfrom all that hemmed her in and beset her. At any rate it began to loom\nagainst the rainy dawn; and the longer she looked at it the more clearly\nshe understood that now at last she was really going there.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nTHE rain held off, and an hour later, when she started, wild gleams of\nsunlight were blowing across the fields.\n\nAfter Harney's departure she had returned her bicycle to its owner at\nCreston, and she was not sure of being able to walk all the way to the\nMountain. The deserted house was on the road; but the idea of spending\nthe night there was unendurable, and she meant to try to push on to\nHamblin, where she could sleep under a wood-shed if her strength should\nfail her. Her preparations had been made with quiet forethought. Before\nstarting she had forced herself to swallow a glass of milk and eat a\npiece of bread; and she had put in her canvas satchel a little packet of\nthe chocolate that Harney always carried in his bicycle bag. She wanted\nabove all to keep up her strength, and reach her destination without\nattracting notice....\n\nMile by mile she retraced the road over which she had so often flown to\nher lover. When she reached the turn where the wood-road branched off\nfrom the Creston highway she remembered the Gospel tent--long since\nfolded up and transplanted--and her start of involuntary terror when\nthe fat evangelist had said: “Your Saviour knows everything. Come and\nconfess your guilt.” There was no sense of guilt in her now, but only\na desperate desire to defend her secret from irreverent eyes, and\nbegin life again among people to whom the harsh code of the village was\nunknown. The impulse did not shape itself in thought: she only knew\nshe must save her baby, and hide herself with it somewhere where no one\nwould ever come to trouble them.\n\nShe walked on and on, growing more heavy-footed as the day advanced. It\nseemed a cruel chance that compelled her to retrace every step of the\nway to the deserted house; and when she came in sight of the orchard,\nand the silver-gray roof slanting crookedly through the laden branches,\nher strength failed her and she sat down by the road-side. She sat there\na long time, trying to gather the courage to start again, and walk past\nthe broken gate and the untrimmed rose-bushes strung with scarlet hips.\nA few drops of rain were falling, and she thought of the warm evenings\nwhen she and Harney had sat embraced in the shadowy room, and the noise\nof summer showers on the roof had rustled through their kisses. At\nlength she understood that if she stayed any longer the rain might\ncompel her to take shelter in the house overnight, and she got up and\nwalked on, averting her eyes as she came abreast of the white gate and\nthe tangled garden.\n\nThe hours wore on, and she walked more and more slowly, pausing now and\nthen to rest, and to eat a little bread and an apple picked up from the\nroadside. Her body seemed to grow heavier with every yard of the way,\nand she wondered how she would be able to carry her child later, if\nalready he laid such a burden on her.... A fresh wind had sprung up,\nscattering the rain and blowing down keenly from the mountain. Presently\nthe clouds lowered again, and a few white darts struck her in the face:\nit was the first snow falling over Hamblin. The roofs of the lonely\nvillage were only half a mile ahead, and she was resolved to push beyond\nit, and try to reach the Mountain that night. She had no clear plan of\naction, except that, once in the settlement, she meant to look for Liff\nHyatt, and get him to take her to her mother. She herself had been\nborn as her own baby was going to be born; and whatever her mother's\nsubsequent life had been, she could hardly help remembering the past,\nand receiving a daughter who was facing the trouble she had known.\n\nSuddenly the deadly faintness came over her once more and she sat down\non the bank and leaned her head against a tree-trunk. The long road and\nthe cloudy landscape vanished from her eyes, and for a time she seemed\nto be circling about in some terrible wheeling darkness. Then that too\nfaded.\n\nShe opened her eyes, and saw a buggy drawn up beside her, and a man\nwho had jumped down from it and was gazing at her with a puzzled face.\nSlowly consciousness came back, and she saw that the man was Liff Hyatt.\n\nShe was dimly aware that he was asking her something, and she looked at\nhim in silence, trying to find strength to speak. At length her voice\nstirred in her throat, and she said in a whisper: “I'm going up the\nMountain.”\n\n“Up the Mountain?” he repeated, drawing aside a little; and as he\nmoved she saw behind him, in the buggy, a heavily coated figure with a\nfamiliar pink face and gold spectacles on the bridge of a Grecian nose.\n\n“Charity! What on earth are you doing here?” Mr. Miles exclaimed,\nthrowing the reins on the horse's back and scrambling down from the\nbuggy.\n\nShe lifted her heavy eyes to his. “I'm going to see my mother.”\n\nThe two men glanced at each other, and for a moment neither of them\nspoke.\n\nThen Mr. Miles said: “You look ill, my dear, and it's a long way. Do you\nthink it's wise?”\n\nCharity stood up. “I've got to go to her.”\n\nA vague mirthless grin contracted Liff Hyatt's face, and Mr. Miles again\nspoke uncertainly. “You know, then--you'd been told?”\n\nShe stared at him. “I don't know what you mean. I want to go to her.”\n\nMr. Miles was examining her thoughtfully. She fancied she saw a change\nin his expression, and the blood rushed to her forehead. “I just want to\ngo to her,” she repeated.\n\nHe laid his hand on her arm. “My child, your mother is dying. Liff Hyatt\ncame down to fetch me.... Get in and come with us.”\n\nHe helped her up to the seat at his side, Liff Hyatt clambered in at\nthe back, and they drove off toward Hamblin. At first Charity had\nhardly grasped what Mr. Miles was saying; the physical relief of finding\nherself seated in the buggy, and securely on her road to the Mountain,\neffaced the impression of his words. But as her head cleared she\nbegan to understand. She knew the Mountain had but the most infrequent\nintercourse with the valleys; she had often enough heard it said that no\none ever went up there except the minister, when someone was dying. And\nnow it was her mother who was dying... and she would find herself as\nmuch alone on the Mountain as anywhere else in the world. The sense of\nunescapable isolation was all she could feel for the moment; then\nshe began to wonder at the strangeness of its being Mr. Miles who had\nundertaken to perform this grim errand. He did not seem in the least\nlike the kind of man who would care to go up the Mountain. But here he\nwas at her side, guiding the horse with a firm hand, and bending on her\nthe kindly gleam of his spectacles, as if there were nothing unusual in\ntheir being together in such circumstances.\n\nFor a while she found it impossible to speak, and he seemed to\nunderstand this, and made no attempt to question her. But presently she\nfelt her tears rise and flow down over her drawn cheeks; and he must\nhave seen them too, for he laid his hand on hers, and said in a low\nvoice: “Won't you tell me what is troubling you?”\n\nShe shook her head, and he did not insist: but after a while he said, in\nthe same low tone, so that they should not be overheard: “Charity, what\ndo you know of your childhood, before you came down to North Dormer?”\n\nShe controlled herself, and answered: “Nothing only what I heard Mr.\nRoyall say one day. He said he brought me down because my father went to\nprison.”\n\n“And you've never been up there since?”\n\n“Never.”\n\nMr. Miles was silent again, then he said: “I'm glad you're coming with\nme now. Perhaps we may find your mother alive, and she may know that you\nhave come.”\n\nThey had reached Hamblin, where the snow-flurry had left white patches\nin the rough grass on the roadside, and in the angles of the roofs\nfacing north. It was a poor bleak village under the granite flank of the\nMountain, and as soon as they left it they began to climb. The road was\nsteep and full of ruts, and the horse settled down to a walk while they\nmounted and mounted, the world dropping away below them in great mottled\nstretches of forest and field, and stormy dark blue distances.\n\nCharity had often had visions of this ascent of the Mountain but she\nhad not known it would reveal so wide a country, and the sight of\nthose strange lands reaching away on every side gave her a new sense of\nHarney's remoteness. She knew he must be miles and miles beyond the last\nrange of hills that seemed to be the outmost verge of things, and she\nwondered how she had ever dreamed of going to New York to find him....\n\nAs the road mounted the country grew bleaker, and they drove across\nfields of faded mountain grass bleached by long months beneath the snow.\nIn the hollows a few white birches trembled, or a mountain ash lit its\nscarlet clusters; but only a scant growth of pines darkened the granite\nledges. The wind was blowing fiercely across the open slopes; the horse\nfaced it with bent head and straining flanks, and now and then the buggy\nswayed so that Charity had to clutch its side.\n\nMr. Miles had not spoken again; he seemed to understand that she wanted\nto be left alone. After a while the track they were following forked,\nand he pulled up the horse, as if uncertain of the way. Liff Hyatt\ncraned his head around from the back, and shouted against the wind:\n“Left----” and they turned into a stunted pine-wood and began to drive\ndown the other side of the Mountain.\n\nA mile or two farther on they came out on a clearing where two or three\nlow houses lay in stony fields, crouching among the rocks as if to brace\nthemselves against the wind. They were hardly more than sheds, built of\nlogs and rough boards, with tin stove-pipes sticking out of their roofs.\nThe sun was setting, and dusk had already fallen on the lower world,\nbut a yellow glare still lay on the lonely hillside and the crouching\nhouses. The next moment it faded and left the landscape in dark autumn\ntwilight.\n\n“Over there,” Liff called out, stretching his long arm over Mr. Miles's\nshoulder. The clergyman turned to the left, across a bit of bare ground\novergrown with docks and nettles, and stopped before the most ruinous of\nthe sheds. A stove-pipe reached its crooked arm out of one window, and\nthe broken panes of the other were stuffed with rags and paper.\n\nIn contrast to such a dwelling the brown house in the swamp might have\nstood for the home of plenty.\n\nAs the buggy drew up two or three mongrel dogs jumped out of the\ntwilight with a great barking, and a young man slouched to the door and\nstood there staring. In the twilight Charity saw that his face had the\nsame sodden look as Bash Hyatt's, the day she had seen him sleeping\nby the stove. He made no effort to silence the dogs, but leaned in the\ndoor, as if roused from a drunken lethargy, while Mr. Miles got out of\nthe buggy.\n\n“Is it here?” the clergyman asked Liff in a low voice; and Liff nodded.\n\nMr. Miles turned to Charity. “Just hold the horse a minute, my dear:\nI'll go in first,” he said, putting the reins in her hands. She took\nthem passively, and sat staring straight ahead of her at the darkening\nscene while Mr. Miles and Liff Hyatt went up to the house. They stood\na few minutes talking with the man in the door, and then Mr. Miles came\nback. As he came close, Charity saw that his smooth pink face wore a\nfrightened solemn look.\n\n“Your mother is dead, Charity; you'd better come with me,” he said.\n\nShe got down and followed him while Liff led the horse away. As\nshe approached the door she said to herself: “This is where I was\nborn... this is where I belong....” She had said it to herself often\nenough as she looked across the sunlit valleys at the Mountain; but it\nhad meant nothing then, and now it had become a reality. Mr. Miles took\nher gently by the arm, and they entered what appeared to be the only\nroom in the house. It was so dark that she could just discern a group\nof a dozen people sitting or sprawling about a table made of boards laid\nacross two barrels. They looked up listlessly as Mr. Miles and Charity\ncame in, and a woman's thick voice said: “Here's the preacher.” But no\none moved.\n\nMr. Miles paused and looked about him; then he turned to the young man\nwho had met them at the door.\n\n“Is the body here?” he asked.\n\nThe young man, instead of answering, turned his head toward the group.\n“Where's the candle? I tole yer to bring a candle,” he said with sudden\nharshness to a girl who was lolling against the table. She did not\nanswer, but another man got up and took from some corner a candle stuck\ninto a bottle.\n\n“How'll I light it? The stove's out,” the girl grumbled.\n\nMr. Miles fumbled under his heavy wrappings and drew out a match-box.\nHe held a match to the candle, and in a moment or two a faint circle of\nlight fell on the pale aguish heads that started out of the shadow like\nthe heads of nocturnal animals.\n\n“Mary's over there,” someone said; and Mr. Miles, taking the bottle in\nhis hand, passed behind the table. Charity followed him, and they stood\nbefore a mattress on the floor in a corner of the room. A woman lay on\nit, but she did not look like a dead woman; she seemed to have fallen\nacross her squalid bed in a drunken sleep, and to have been left lying\nwhere she fell, in her ragged disordered clothes. One arm was flung\nabove her head, one leg drawn up under a torn skirt that left the other\nbare to the knee: a swollen glistening leg with a ragged stocking rolled\ndown about the ankle. The woman lay on her back, her eyes staring up\nunblinkingly at the candle that trembled in Mr. Miles's hand.\n\n“She jus' dropped off,” a woman said, over the shoulder of the others;\nand the young man added: “I jus' come in and found her.”\n\nAn elderly man with lank hair and a feeble grin pushed between them. “It\nwas like this: I says to her on'y the night before: if you don't take\nand quit, I says to her...”\n\nSomeone pulled him back and sent him reeling against a bench along the\nwall, where he dropped down muttering his unheeded narrative.\n\nThere was a silence; then the young woman who had been lolling against\nthe table suddenly parted the group, and stood in front of Charity.\nShe was healthier and robuster looking than the others, and her\nweather-beaten face had a certain sullen beauty.\n\n“Who's the girl? Who brought her here?” she said, fixing her eyes\nmistrustfully on the young man who had rebuked her for not having a\ncandle ready.\n\nMr. Miles spoke. “I brought her; she is Mary Hyatt's daughter.”\n\n“What? Her too?” the girl sneered; and the young man turned on her with\nan oath. “Shut your mouth, damn you, or get out of here,” he said;\nthen he relapsed into his former apathy, and dropped down on the bench,\nleaning his head against the wall.\n\nMr. Miles had set the candle on the floor and taken off his heavy coat.\nHe turned to Charity. “Come and help me,” he said.\n\nHe knelt down by the mattress, and pressed the lids over the dead\nwoman's eyes. Charity, trembling and sick, knelt beside him, and tried\nto compose her mother's body. She drew the stocking over the dreadful\nglistening leg, and pulled the skirt down to the battered upturned\nboots. As she did so, she looked at her mother's face, thin yet swollen,\nwith lips parted in a frozen gasp above the broken teeth. There was no\nsign in it of anything human: she lay there like a dead dog in a ditch.\nCharity's hands grew cold as they touched her.\n\nMr. Miles drew the woman's arms across her breast and laid his coat\nover her. Then he covered her face with his handkerchief, and placed the\nbottle with the candle in it at her head. Having done this he stood up.\n\n“Is there no coffin?” he asked, turning to the group behind him.\n\nThere was a moment of bewildered silence; then the fierce girl spoke up.\n“You'd oughter brought it with you. Where'd we get one here, I'd like\nter know?”\n\nMr. Miles, looking at the others, repeated: “Is it possible you have no\ncoffin ready?”\n\n“That's what I say: them that has it sleeps better,” an old woman\nmurmured. “But then she never had no bed....”\n\n“And the stove warn't hers,” said the lank-haired man, on the defensive.\n\nMr. Miles turned away from them and moved a few steps apart. He had\ndrawn a book from his pocket, and after a pause he opened it and began\nto read, holding the book at arm's length and low down, so that the\npages caught the feeble light. Charity had remained on her knees by the\nmattress: now that her mother's face was covered it was easier to stay\nnear her, and avoid the sight of the living faces which too horribly\nshowed by what stages hers had lapsed into death.\n\n“I am the Resurrection and the Life,” Mr. Miles began; “he that\nbelieveth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.... Though after\nmy skin worms destroy my body, yet in my flesh shall I see God....”\n\nIN MY FLESH SHALL I SEE GOD! Charity thought of the gaping mouth and\nstony eyes under the handkerchief, and of the glistening leg over which\nshe had drawn the stocking....\n\n“We brought nothing into this world and we shall take nothing out of\nit----”\n\nThere was a sudden muttering and a scuffle at the back of the group. “I\nbrought the stove,” said the elderly man with lank hair, pushing his\nway between the others. “I wen' down to Creston'n bought it... n' I got a\nright to take it outer here... n' I'll lick any feller says I ain't....”\n\n“Sit down, damn you!” shouted the tall youth who had been drowsing on\nthe bench against the wall.\n\n“For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain; he\nheapeth up riches and cannot tell who shall gather them....”\n\n“Well, it ARE his,” a woman in the background interjected in a\nfrightened whine.\n\nThe tall youth staggered to his feet. “If you don't hold your mouths\nI'll turn you all out o' here, the whole lot of you,” he cried with many\noaths. “G'wan, minister... don't let 'em faze you....”\n\n“Now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first-fruits of them\nthat slept.... Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but\nwe shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at\nthe last trump.... For this corruptible must put on incorruption and this\nmortal must put on immortality. So when this corruption shall have put\non incorruption, and when this mortal shall have put on immortality,\nthen shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is\nswallowed up in Victory....”\n\nOne by one the mighty words fell on Charity's bowed head, soothing\nthe horror, subduing the tumult, mastering her as they mastered the\ndrink-dazed creatures at her back. Mr. Miles read to the last word, and\nthen closed the book.\n\n“Is the grave ready?” he asked.\n\nLiff Hyatt, who had come in while he was reading, nodded a “Yes,” and\npushed forward to the side of the mattress. The young man on the bench\nwho seemed to assert some sort of right of kinship with the dead woman,\ngot to his feet again, and the proprietor of the stove joined him.\nBetween them they raised up the mattress; but their movements were\nunsteady, and the coat slipped to the floor, revealing the poor body in\nits helpless misery. Charity, picking up the coat, covered her mother\nonce more. Liff had brought a lantern, and the old woman who had already\nspoken took it up, and opened the door to let the little procession\npass out. The wind had dropped, and the night was very dark and bitterly\ncold. The old woman walked ahead, the lantern shaking in her hand and\nspreading out before her a pale patch of dead grass and coarse-leaved\nweeds enclosed in an immensity of blackness.\n\nMr. Miles took Charity by the arm, and side by side they walked behind\nthe mattress. At length the old woman with the lantern stopped, and\nCharity saw the light fall on the stooping shoulders of the bearers and\non a ridge of upheaved earth over which they were bending. Mr. Miles\nreleased her arm and approached the hollow on the other side of the\nridge; and while the men stooped down, lowering the mattress into the\ngrave, he began to speak again.\n\n“Man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live and is full\nof misery.... He cometh up and is cut down... he fleeth as it were a\nshadow.... Yet, O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty, O holy and\nmerciful Saviour, deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal\ndeath....”\n\n“Easy there... is she down?” piped the claimant to the stove; and the\nyoung man called over his shoulder: “Lift the light there, can't you?”\n\nThere was a pause, during which the light floated uncertainly over the\nopen grave. Someone bent over and pulled out Mr. Miles's coat----(“No,\nno--leave the handkerchief,” he interposed)--and then Liff Hyatt, coming\nforward with a spade, began to shovel in the earth.\n\n“Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of His great mercy to take\nunto Himself the soul of our dear sister here departed, we therefore\ncommit her body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to\ndust...” Liff's gaunt shoulders rose and bent in the lantern light as he\ndashed the clods of earth into the grave. “God--it's froze a'ready,”\n he muttered, spitting into his palm and passing his ragged shirt-sleeve\nacross his perspiring face.\n\n“Through our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body that it\nmay be like unto His glorious body, according to the mighty working,\nwhereby He is able to subdue all things unto Himself...” The last\nspadeful of earth fell on the vile body of Mary Hyatt, and Liff rested\non his spade, his shoulder blades still heaving with the effort.\n\n“Lord, have mercy upon us, Christ have mercy upon us, Lord have mercy\nupon us...”\n\nMr. Miles took the lantern from the old woman's hand and swept its light\nacross the circle of bleared faces. “Now kneel down, all of you,” he\ncommanded, in a voice of authority that Charity had never heard.\nShe knelt down at the edge of the grave, and the others, stiffly and\nhesitatingly, got to their knees beside her. Mr. Miles knelt, too. “And\nnow pray with me--you know this prayer,” he said, and he began: “Our\nFather which art in Heaven...” One or two of the women falteringly took\nthe words up, and when he ended, the lank-haired man flung himself on\nthe neck of the tall youth. “It was this way,” he said. “I tole her the\nnight before, I says to her...” The reminiscence ended in a sob.\n\nMr. Miles had been getting into his coat again. He came up to Charity,\nwho had remained passively kneeling by the rough mound of earth.\n\n“My child, you must come. It's very late.”\n\nShe lifted her eyes to his face: he seemed to speak out of another\nworld.\n\n“I ain't coming: I'm going to stay here.”\n\n“Here? Where? What do you mean?”\n\n“These are my folks. I'm going to stay with them.”\n\nMr. Miles lowered his voice. “But it's not possible--you don't know what\nyou are doing. You can't stay among these people: you must come with\nme.”\n\nShe shook her head and rose from her knees. The group about the grave\nhad scattered in the darkness, but the old woman with the lantern stood\nwaiting. Her mournful withered face was not unkind, and Charity went up\nto her.\n\n“Have you got a place where I can lie down for the night?” she asked.\nLiff came up, leading the buggy out of the night. He looked from one\nto the other with his feeble smile. “She's my mother. She'll take you\nhome,” he said; and he added, raising his voice to speak to the\nold woman: “It's the girl from lawyer Royall's--Mary's girl... you\nremember....”\n\nThe woman nodded and raised her sad old eyes to Charity's. When Mr.\nMiles and Liff clambered into the buggy she went ahead with the lantern\nto show them the track they were to follow; then she turned back, and in\nsilence she and Charity walked away together through the night.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\nCHARITY lay on the floor on a mattress, as her dead mother's body had\nlain. The room in which she lay was cold and dark and low-ceilinged, and\neven poorer and barer than the scene of Mary Hyatt's earthly pilgrimage.\nOn the other side of the fireless stove Liff Hyatt's mother slept on\na blanket, with two children--her grandchildren, she said--rolled up\nagainst her like sleeping puppies. They had their thin clothes spread\nover them, having given the only other blanket to their guest.\n\nThrough the small square of glass in the opposite wall Charity saw a\ndeep funnel of sky, so black, so remote, so palpitating with frosty\nstars that her very soul seemed to be sucked into it. Up there\nsomewhere, she supposed, the God whom Mr. Miles had invoked was waiting\nfor Mary Hyatt to appear. What a long flight it was! And what would she\nhave to say when she reached Him?\n\nCharity's bewildered brain laboured with the attempt to picture her\nmother's past, and to relate it in any way to the designs of a just but\nmerciful God; but it was impossible to imagine any link between them.\nShe herself felt as remote from the poor creature she had seen lowered\ninto her hastily dug grave as if the height of the heavens divided them.\nShe had seen poverty and misfortune in her life; but in a community\nwhere poor thrifty Mrs. Hawes and the industrious Ally represented the\nnearest approach to destitution there was nothing to suggest the savage\nmisery of the Mountain farmers.\n\nAs she lay there, half-stunned by her tragic initiation, Charity vainly\ntried to think herself into the life about her. But she could not even\nmake out what relationship these people bore to each other, or to her\ndead mother; they seemed to be herded together in a sort of passive\npromiscuity in which their common misery was the strongest link. She\ntried to picture to herself what her life would have been if she had\ngrown up on the Mountain, running wild in rags, sleeping on the floor\ncurled up against her mother, like the pale-faced children huddled\nagainst old Mrs. Hyatt, and turning into a fierce bewildered creature\nlike the girl who had apostrophized her in such strange words. She was\nfrightened by the secret affinity she had felt with this girl, and by\nthe light it threw on her own beginnings. Then she remembered what Mr.\nRoyall had said in telling her story to Lucius Harney: “Yes, there was\na mother; but she was glad to have the child go. She'd have given her to\nanybody....”\n\nWell! after all, was her mother so much to blame? Charity, since that\nday, had always thought of her as destitute of all human feeling; now\nshe seemed merely pitiful. What mother would not want to save her child\nfrom such a life? Charity thought of the future of her own child, and\ntears welled into her aching eyes, and ran down over her face. If she\nhad been less exhausted, less burdened with his weight, she would have\nsprung up then and there and fled away....\n\nThe grim hours of the night dragged themselves slowly by, and at last\nthe sky paled and dawn threw a cold blue beam into the room. She lay\nin her corner staring at the dirty floor, the clothes-line hung with\ndecaying rags, the old woman huddled against the cold stove, and the\nlight gradually spreading across the wintry world, and bringing with it\na new day in which she would have to live, to choose, to act, to make\nherself a place among these people--or to go back to the life she had\nleft. A mortal lassitude weighed on her. There were moments when she\nfelt that all she asked was to go on lying there unnoticed; then her\nmind revolted at the thought of becoming one of the miserable herd from\nwhich she sprang, and it seemed as though, to save her child from such\na fate, she would find strength to travel any distance, and bear any\nburden life might put on her.\n\nVague thoughts of Nettleton flitted through her mind. She said to\nherself that she would find some quiet place where she could bear her\nchild, and give it to decent people to keep; and then she would go out\nlike Julia Hawes and earn its living and hers. She knew that girls of\nthat kind sometimes made enough to have their children nicely cared for;\nand every other consideration disappeared in the vision of her baby,\ncleaned and combed and rosy, and hidden away somewhere where she could\nrun in and kiss it, and bring it pretty things to wear. Anything,\nanything was better than to add another life to the nest of misery on\nthe Mountain....\n\nThe old woman and the children were still sleeping when Charity rose\nfrom her mattress. Her body was stiff with cold and fatigue, and she\nmoved slowly lest her heavy steps should rouse them. She was faint with\nhunger, and had nothing left in her satchel; but on the table she saw\nthe half of a stale loaf. No doubt it was to serve as the breakfast of\nold Mrs. Hyatt and the children; but Charity did not care; she had her\nown baby to think of. She broke off a piece of the bread and ate\nit greedily; then her glance fell on the thin faces of the sleeping\nchildren, and filled with compunction she rummaged in her satchel for\nsomething with which to pay for what she had taken. She found one of\nthe pretty chemises that Ally had made for her, with a blue ribbon run\nthrough its edging. It was one of the dainty things on which she had\nsquandered her savings, and as she looked at it the blood rushed to her\nforehead. She laid the chemise on the table, and stealing across the\nfloor lifted the latch and went out....\n\nThe morning was icy cold and a pale sun was just rising above the\neastern shoulder of the Mountain. The houses scattered on the hillside\nlay cold and smokeless under the sun-flecked clouds, and not a human\nbeing was in sight. Charity paused on the threshold and tried to\ndiscover the road by which she had come the night before. Across the\nfield surrounding Mrs. Hyatt's shanty she saw the tumble-down house in\nwhich she supposed the funeral service had taken place. The trail\nran across the ground between the two houses and disappeared in the\npine-wood on the flank of the Mountain; and a little way to the right,\nunder a wind-beaten thorn, a mound of fresh earth made a dark spot\non the fawn-coloured stubble. Charity walked across the field to the\nground. As she approached it she heard a bird's note in the still air,\nand looking up she saw a brown song-sparrow perched in an upper branch\nof the thorn above the grave. She stood a minute listening to his small\nsolitary song; then she rejoined the trail and began to mount the hill\nto the pine-wood.\n\nThus far she had been impelled by the blind instinct of flight; but each\nstep seemed to bring her nearer to the realities of which her feverish\nvigil had given only a shadowy image. Now that she walked again in a\ndaylight world, on the way back to familiar things, her imagination\nmoved more soberly. On one point she was still decided: she could not\nremain at North Dormer, and the sooner she got away from it the better.\nBut everything beyond was darkness.\n\nAs she continued to climb the air grew keener, and when she passed from\nthe shelter of the pines to the open grassy roof of the Mountain the\ncold wind of the night before sprang out on her. She bent her shoulders\nand struggled on against it for a while; but presently her breath\nfailed, and she sat down under a ledge of rock overhung by shivering\nbirches. From where she sat she saw the trail wandering across the\nbleached grass in the direction of Hamblin, and the granite wall of the\nMountain falling away to infinite distances. On that side of the ridge\nthe valleys still lay in wintry shadow; but in the plain beyond the sun\nwas touching village roofs and steeples, and gilding the haze of smoke\nover far-off invisible towns.\n\nCharity felt herself a mere speck in the lonely circle of the sky. The\nevents of the last two days seemed to have divided her forever from\nher short dream of bliss. Even Harney's image had been blurred by that\ncrushing experience: she thought of him as so remote from her that he\nseemed hardly more than a memory. In her fagged and floating mind only\none sensation had the weight of reality; it was the bodily burden of\nher child. But for it she would have felt as rootless as the whiffs of\nthistledown the wind blew past her. Her child was like a load that held\nher down, and yet like a hand that pulled her to her feet. She said to\nherself that she must get up and struggle on....\n\nHer eyes turned back to the trail across the top of the Mountain, and\nin the distance she saw a buggy against the sky. She knew its antique\noutline, and the gaunt build of the old horse pressing forward with\nlowered head; and after a moment she recognized the heavy bulk of the\nman who held the reins. The buggy was following the trail and making\nstraight for the pine-wood through which she had climbed; and she knew\nat once that the driver was in search of her. Her first impulse was\nto crouch down under the ledge till he had passed; but the instinct of\nconcealment was overruled by the relief of feeling that someone was near\nher in the awful emptiness. She stood up and walked toward the buggy.\n\nMr. Royall saw her, and touched the horse with the whip. A minute or two\nlater he was abreast of Charity; their eyes met, and without speaking he\nleaned over and helped her up into the buggy.\n\nShe tried to speak, to stammer out some explanation, but no words came\nto her; and as he drew the cover over her knees he simply said: “The\nminister told me he'd left you up here, so I come up for you.”\n\nHe turned the horse's head, and they began to jog back toward Hamblin.\nCharity sat speechless, staring straight ahead of her, and Mr. Royall\noccasionally uttered a word of encouragement to the horse: “Get along\nthere, Dan.... I gave him a rest at Hamblin; but I brought him along\npretty quick, and it's a stiff pull up here against the wind.”\n\nAs he spoke it occurred to her for the first time that to reach the top\nof the Mountain so early he must have left North Dormer at the coldest\nhour of the night, and have travelled steadily but for the halt at\nHamblin; and she felt a softness at her heart which no act of his had\never produced since he had brought her the Crimson Rambler because she\nhad given up boarding-school to stay with him.\n\nAfter an interval he began again: “It was a day just like this, only\nspitting snow, when I come up here for you the first time.” Then, as if\nfearing that she might take his remark as a reminder of past benefits,\nhe added quickly: “I dunno's you think it was such a good job, either.”\n\n“Yes, I do,” she murmured, looking straight ahead of her.\n\n“Well,” he said, “I tried----”\n\nHe did not finish the sentence, and she could think of nothing more to\nsay.\n\n“Ho, there, Dan, step out,” he muttered, jerking the bridle. “We ain't\nhome yet.--You cold?” he asked abruptly.\n\nShe shook her head, but he drew the cover higher up, and stooped to tuck\nit in about the ankles. She continued to look straight ahead. Tears of\nweariness and weakness were dimming her eyes and beginning to run over,\nbut she dared not wipe them away lest he should observe the gesture.\n\nThey drove in silence, following the long loops of the descent upon\nHamblin, and Mr. Royall did not speak again till they reached the\noutskirts of the village. Then he let the reins droop on the dashboard\nand drew out his watch.\n\n“Charity,” he said, “you look fair done up, and North Dormer's a goodish\nway off. I've figured out that we'd do better to stop here long enough\nfor you to get a mouthful of breakfast and then drive down to Creston\nand take the train.”\n\nShe roused herself from her apathetic musing. “The train--what train?”\n\nMr. Royall, without answering, let the horse jog on till they reached\nthe door of the first house in the village. “This is old Mrs. Hobart's\nplace,” he said. “She'll give us something hot to drink.”\n\nCharity, half unconsciously, found herself getting out of the buggy and\nfollowing him in at the open door. They entered a decent kitchen with a\nfire crackling in the stove. An old woman with a kindly face was setting\nout cups and saucers on the table. She looked up and nodded as they\ncame in, and Mr. Royall advanced to the stove, clapping his numb hands\ntogether.\n\n“Well, Mrs. Hobart, you got any breakfast for this young lady? You can\nsee she's cold and hungry.”\n\nMrs. Hobart smiled on Charity and took a tin coffee-pot from the fire.\n“My, you do look pretty mean,” she said compassionately.\n\nCharity reddened, and sat down at the table. A feeling of complete\npassiveness had once more come over her, and she was conscious only of\nthe pleasant animal sensations of warmth and rest.\n\nMrs. Hobart put bread and milk on the table, and then went out of the\nhouse: Charity saw her leading the horse away to the barn across the\nyard. She did not come back, and Mr. Royall and Charity sat alone at the\ntable with the smoking coffee between them. He poured out a cup for her,\nand put a piece of bread in the saucer, and she began to eat.\n\nAs the warmth of the coffee flowed through her veins her thoughts\ncleared and she began to feel like a living being again; but the return\nto life was so painful that the food choked in her throat and she sat\nstaring down at the table in silent anguish.\n\nAfter a while Mr. Royall pushed back his chair. “Now, then,” he said,\n“if you're a mind to go along----” She did not move, and he continued:\n“We can pick up the noon train for Nettleton if you say so.”\n\nThe words sent the blood rushing to her face, and she raised her\nstartled eyes to his. He was standing on the other side of the table\nlooking at her kindly and gravely; and suddenly she understood what he\nwas going to say. She continued to sit motionless, a leaden weight upon\nher lips.\n\n“You and me have spoke some hard things to each other in our time,\nCharity; and there's no good that I can see in any more talking now. But\nI'll never feel any way but one about you; and if you say so we'll drive\ndown in time to catch that train, and go straight to the minister's\nhouse; and when you come back home you'll come as Mrs. Royall.”\n\nHis voice had the grave persuasive accent that had moved his hearers at\nthe Home Week festival; she had a sense of depths of mournful tolerance\nunder that easy tone. Her whole body began to tremble with the dread of\nher own weakness.\n\n“Oh, I can't----” she burst out desperately.\n\n“Can't what?”\n\nShe herself did not know: she was not sure if she was rejecting what he\noffered, or already struggling against the temptation of taking what\nshe no longer had a right to. She stood up, shaking and bewildered, and\nbegan to speak:\n\n“I know I ain't been fair to you always; but I want to be now.... I want\nyou to know... I want...” Her voice failed her and she stopped.\n\nMr. Royall leaned against the wall. He was paler than usual, but his\nface was composed and kindly and her agitation did not appear to perturb\nhim.\n\n“What's all this about wanting?” he said as she paused. “Do you know\nwhat you really want? I'll tell you. You want to be took home and took\ncare of. And I guess that's all there is to say.”\n\n“No... it's not all....”\n\n“Ain't it?” He looked at his watch. “Well, I'll tell you another thing.\nAll I want is to know if you'll marry me. If there was anything else,\nI'd tell you so; but there ain't. Come to my age, a man knows the things\nthat matter and the things that don't; that's about the only good turn\nlife does us.”\n\nHis tone was so strong and resolute that it was like a supporting arm\nabout her. She felt her resistance melting, her strength slipping away\nfrom her as he spoke.\n\n“Don't cry, Charity,” he exclaimed in a shaken voice. She looked up,\nstartled at his emotion, and their eyes met.\n\n“See here,” he said gently, “old Dan's come a long distance, and we've\ngot to let him take it easy the rest of the way....”\n\nHe picked up the cloak that had slipped to her chair and laid it about\nher shoulders. She followed him out of the house, and then walked across\nthe yard to the shed, where the horse was tied. Mr. Royall unblanketed\nhim and led him out into the road. Charity got into the buggy and he\ndrew the cover about her and shook out the reins with a cluck. When\nthey reached the end of the village he turned the horse's head toward\nCreston.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nThey began to jog down the winding road to the valley at old Dan's\nlanguid pace. Charity felt herself sinking into deeper depths of\nweariness, and as they descended through the bare woods there were\nmoments when she lost the exact sense of things, and seemed to be\nsitting beside her lover with the leafy arch of summer bending over\nthem. But this illusion was faint and transitory. For the most part she\nhad only a confused sensation of slipping down a smooth irresistible\ncurrent; and she abandoned herself to the feeling as a refuge from the\ntorment of thought.\n\nMr. Royall seldom spoke, but his silent presence gave her, for the first\ntime, a sense of peace and security. She knew that where he was there\nwould be warmth, rest, silence; and for the moment they were all she\nwanted. She shut her eyes, and even these things grew dim to her....\n\nIn the train, during the short run from Creston to Nettleton, the warmth\naroused her, and the consciousness of being under strange eyes gave her\na momentary energy. She sat upright, facing Mr. Royall, and stared out\nof the window at the denuded country. Forty-eight hours earlier, when\nshe had last traversed it, many of the trees still held their leaves;\nbut the high wind of the last two nights had stripped them, and the\nlines of the landscape' were as finely pencilled as in December. A\nfew days of autumn cold had wiped out all trace of the rich fields and\nlanguid groves through which she had passed on the Fourth of July; and\nwith the fading of the landscape those fervid hours had faded, too. She\ncould no longer believe that she was the being who had lived them; she\nwas someone to whom something irreparable and overwhelming had happened,\nbut the traces of the steps leading up to it had almost vanished.\n\nWhen the train reached Nettleton and she walked out into the square at\nMr. Royall's side the sense of unreality grew more overpowering. The\nphysical strain of the night and day had left no room in her mind for\nnew sensations and she followed Mr. Royall as passively as a tired\nchild. As in a confused dream she presently found herself sitting with\nhim in a pleasant room, at a table with a red and white table-cloth\non which hot food and tea were placed. He filled her cup and plate and\nwhenever she lifted her eyes from them she found his resting on her with\nthe same steady tranquil gaze that had reassured and strengthened\nher when they had faced each other in old Mrs. Hobart's kitchen. As\neverything else in her consciousness grew more and more confused\nand immaterial, became more and more like the universal shimmer that\ndissolves the world to failing eyes, Mr. Royall's presence began to\ndetach itself with rocky firmness from this elusive background. She had\nalways thought of him--when she thought of him at all--as of someone\nhateful and obstructive, but whom she could outwit and dominate when\nshe chose to make the effort. Only once, on the day of the Old Home Week\ncelebration, while the stray fragments of his address drifted across\nher troubled mind, had she caught a glimpse of another being, a being so\ndifferent from the dull-witted enemy with whom she had supposed herself\nto be living that even through the burning mist of her own dreams he\nhad stood out with startling distinctness. For a moment, then, what he\nsaid--and something in his way of saying it--had made her see why he had\nalways struck her as such a lonely man. But the mist of her dreams had\nhidden him again, and she had forgotten that fugitive impression.\n\nIt came back to her now, as they sat at the table, and gave her, through\nher own immeasurable desolation, a sudden sense of their nearness to\neach other. But all these feelings were only brief streaks of light in\nthe grey blur of her physical weakness. Through it she was aware that\nMr. Royall presently left her sitting by the table in the warm room, and\ncame back after an interval with a carriage from the station--a closed\n“hack” with sun-burnt blue silk blinds--in which they drove together\nto a house covered with creepers and standing next to a church with a\ncarpet of turf before it. They got out at this house, and the carriage\nwaited while they walked up the path and entered a wainscoted hall and\nthen a room full of books. In this room a clergyman whom Charity had\nnever seen received them pleasantly, and asked them to be seated for a\nfew minutes while witnesses were being summoned.\n\nCharity sat down obediently, and Mr. Royall, his hands behind his back,\npaced slowly up and down the room. As he turned and faced Charity, she\nnoticed that his lips were twitching a little; but the look in his eyes\nwas grave and calm. Once he paused before her and said timidly: “Your\nhair's got kinder loose with the wind,” and she lifted her hands and\ntried to smooth back the locks that had escaped from her braid. There\nwas a looking-glass in a carved frame on the wall, but she was ashamed\nto look at herself in it, and she sat with her hands folded on her knee\ntill the clergyman returned. Then they went out again, along a sort of\narcaded passage, and into a low vaulted room with a cross on an altar,\nand rows of benches. The clergyman, who had left them at the door,\npresently reappeared before the altar in a surplice, and a lady who was\nprobably his wife, and a man in a blue shirt who had been raking dead\nleaves on the lawn, came in and sat on one of the benches.\n\nThe clergyman opened a book and signed to Charity and Mr. Royall to\napproach. Mr. Royall advanced a few steps, and Charity followed him as\nshe had followed him to the buggy when they went out of Mrs. Hobart's\nkitchen; she had the feeling that if she ceased to keep close to him,\nand do what he told her to do, the world would slip away from beneath\nher feet.\n\nThe clergyman began to read, and on her dazed mind there rose the memory\nof Mr. Miles, standing the night before in the desolate house of the\nMountain, and reading out of the same book words that had the same dread\nsound of finality:\n\n“I require and charge you both, as ye will answer at the dreadful day\nof judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, that if\neither of you know any impediment whereby ye may not be lawfully joined\ntogether...”\n\nCharity raised her eyes and met Mr. Royall's. They were still looking\nat her kindly and steadily. “I will!” she heard him say a moment later,\nafter another interval of words that she had failed to catch. She was so\nbusy trying to understand the gestures that the clergyman was signalling\nto her to make that she no longer heard what was being said. After\nanother interval the lady on the bench stood up, and taking her hand put\nit in Mr. Royall's. It lay enclosed in his strong palm and she felt\na ring that was too big for her being slipped on her thin finger. She\nunderstood then that she was married....\n\nLate that afternoon Charity sat alone in a bedroom of the fashionable\nhotel where she and Harney had vainly sought a table on the Fourth of\nJuly. She had never before been in so handsomely furnished a room. The\nmirror above the dressing-table reflected the high head-board and fluted\npillow-slips of the double bed, and a bedspread so spotlessly white that\nshe had hesitated to lay her hat and jacket on it. The humming radiator\ndiffused an atmosphere of drowsy warmth, and through a half-open door\nshe saw the glitter of the nickel taps above twin marble basins.\n\nFor a while the long turmoil of the night and day had slipped away from\nher and she sat with closed eyes, surrendering herself to the spell of\nwarmth and silence. But presently this merciful apathy was succeeded by\nthe sudden acuteness of vision with which sick people sometimes wake out\nof a heavy sleep. As she opened her eyes they rested on the picture\nthat hung above the bed. It was a large engraving with a dazzling white\nmargin enclosed in a wide frame of bird's-eye maple with an inner scroll\nof gold. The engraving represented a young man in a boat on a lake\nover-hung with trees. He was leaning over to gather water-lilies for the\ngirl in a light dress who lay among the cushions in the stern. The scene\nwas full of a drowsy midsummer radiance, and Charity averted her eyes\nfrom it and, rising from her chair, began to wander restlessly about the\nroom.\n\nIt was on the fifth floor, and its broad window of plate glass looked\nover the roofs of the town. Beyond them stretched a wooded landscape in\nwhich the last fires of sunset were picking out a steely gleam. Charity\ngazed at the gleam with startled eyes. Even through the gathering\ntwilight she recognized the contour of the soft hills encircling it, and\nthe way the meadows sloped to its edge. It was Nettleton Lake that she\nwas looking at.\n\nShe stood a long time in the window staring out at the fading water. The\nsight of it had roused her for the first time to a realization of what\nshe had done. Even the feeling of the ring on her hand had not brought\nher this sharp sense of the irretrievable. For an instant the old\nimpulse of flight swept through her; but it was only the lift of a\nbroken wing. She heard the door open behind her, and Mr. Royall came in.\n\nHe had gone to the barber's to be shaved, and his shaggy grey hair had\nbeen trimmed and smoothed. He moved strongly and quickly, squaring his\nshoulders and carrying his head high, as if he did not want to pass\nunnoticed.\n\n“What are you doing in the dark?” he called out in a cheerful voice.\nCharity made no answer. He went up to the window to draw the blind, and\nputting his finger on the wall flooded the room with a blaze of light\nfrom the central chandelier. In this unfamiliar illumination husband\nand wife faced each other awkwardly for a moment; then Mr. Royall said:\n“We'll step down and have some supper, if you say so.”\n\nThe thought of food filled her with repugnance; but not daring to\nconfess it she smoothed her hair and followed him to the lift.\n\nAn hour later, coming out of the glare of the dining-room, she waited in\nthe marble-panelled hall while Mr. Royall, before the brass lattice\nof one of the corner counters, selected a cigar and bought an\nevening paper. Men were lounging in rocking chairs under the blazing\nchandeliers, travellers coming and going, bells ringing, porters\nshuffling by with luggage. Over Mr. Royall's shoulder, as he leaned\nagainst the counter, a girl with her hair puffed high smirked and nodded\nat a dapper drummer who was getting his key at the desk across the hall.\n\nCharity stood among these cross-currents of life as motionless and inert\nas if she had been one of the tables screwed to the marble floor. All\nher soul was gathered up into one sick sense of coming doom, and she\nwatched Mr. Royall in fascinated terror while he pinched the cigars in\nsuccessive boxes and unfolded his evening paper with a steady hand.\n\nPresently he turned and joined her. “You go right along up to bed--I'm\ngoing to sit down here and have my smoke,” he said. He spoke as easily\nand naturally as if they had been an old couple, long used to each\nother's ways, and her contracted heart gave a flutter of relief. She\nfollowed him to the lift, and he put her in and enjoined the buttoned\nand braided boy to show her to her room.\n\nShe groped her way in through the darkness, forgetting where the\nelectric button was, and not knowing how to manipulate it. But a white\nautumn moon had risen, and the illuminated sky put a pale light in the\nroom. By it she undressed, and after folding up the ruffled pillow-slips\ncrept timidly under the spotless counterpane. She had never felt such\nsmooth sheets or such light warm blankets; but the softness of the bed\ndid not soothe her. She lay there trembling with a fear that ran through\nher veins like ice. “What have I done? Oh, what have I done?” she\nwhispered, shuddering to her pillow; and pressing her face against it\nto shut out the pale landscape beyond the window she lay in the darkness\nstraining her ears, and shaking at every footstep that approached....\n\nSuddenly she sat up and pressed her hands against her frightened heart.\nA faint sound had told her that someone was in the room; but she must\nhave slept in the interval, for she had heard no one enter. The moon was\nsetting beyond the opposite roofs, and in the darkness outlined\nagainst the grey square of the window, she saw a figure seated in the\nrocking-chair. The figure did not move: it was sunk deep in the chair,\nwith bowed head and folded arms, and she saw that it was Mr. Royall who\nsat there. He had not undressed, but had taken the blanket from the\nfoot of the bed and laid it across his knees. Trembling and holding her\nbreath she watched him, fearing that he had been roused by her movement;\nbut he did not stir, and she concluded that he wished her to think he\nwas asleep.\n\nAs she continued to watch him ineffable relief stole slowly over her,\nrelaxing her strained nerves and exhausted body. He knew, then... he\nknew... it was because he knew that he had married her, and that he\nsat there in the darkness to show her she was safe with him. A stir\nof something deeper than she had ever felt in thinking of him flitted\nthrough her tired brain, and cautiously, noiselessly, she let her head\nsink on the pillow....\n\nWhen she woke the room was full of morning light, and her first glance\nshowed her that she was alone in it. She got up and dressed, and as\nshe was fastening her dress the door opened, and Mr. Royall came in. He\nlooked old and tired in the bright daylight, but his face wore the same\nexpression of grave friendliness that had reassured her on the Mountain.\nIt was as if all the dark spirits had gone out of him.\n\nThey went downstairs to the dining-room for breakfast, and after\nbreakfast he told her he had some insurance business to attend to. “I\nguess while I'm doing it you'd better step out and buy yourself whatever\nyou need.” He smiled, and added with an embarrassed laugh: “You know I\nalways wanted you to beat all the other girls.” He drew something from\nhis pocket, and pushed it across the table to her; and she saw that he\nhad given her two twenty-dollar bills. “If it ain't enough there's more\nwhere that come from--I want you to beat 'em all hollow,” he repeated.\n\nShe flushed and tried to stammer out her thanks, but he had pushed back\nhis chair and was leading the way out of the dining-room. In the hall he\npaused a minute to say that if it suited her they would take the three\no'clock train back to North Dormer; then he took his hat and coat from\nthe rack and went out.\n\nA few minutes later Charity went out, too. She had watched to see in\nwhat direction he was going, and she took the opposite way and walked\nquickly down the main street to the brick building on the corner of\nLake Avenue. There she paused to look cautiously up and down the\nthoroughfare, and then climbed the brass-bound stairs to Dr. Merkle's\ndoor. The same bushy-headed mulatto girl admitted her, and after the\nsame interval of waiting in the red plush parlor she was once more\nsummoned to Dr. Merkle's office. The doctor received her without\nsurprise, and led her into the inner plush sanctuary.\n\n“I thought you'd be back, but you've come a mite too soon: I told you\nto be patient and not fret,” she observed, after a pause of penetrating\nscrutiny.\n\nCharity drew the money from her breast. “I've come to get my blue\nbrooch,” she said, flushing.\n\n“Your brooch?” Dr. Merkle appeared not to remember. “My, yes--I get so\nmany things of that kind. Well, my dear, you'll have to wait while I get\nit out of the safe. I don't leave valuables like that laying round like\nthe noospaper.”\n\nShe disappeared for a moment, and returned with a bit of twisted-up\ntissue paper from which she unwrapped the brooch.\n\nCharity, as she looked at it, felt a stir of warmth at her heart. She\nheld out an eager hand.\n\n“Have you got the change?” she asked a little breathlessly, laying one\nof the twenty-dollar bills on the table.\n\n“Change? What'd I want to have change for? I only see two twenties\nthere,” Dr. Merkle answered brightly.\n\nCharity paused, disconcerted. “I thought... you said it was five dollars\na visit....”\n\n“For YOU, as a favour--I did. But how about the responsibility and the\ninsurance? I don't s'pose you ever thought of that? This pin's worth a\nhundred dollars easy. If it had got lost or stole, where'd I been when\nyou come to claim it?”\n\nCharity remained silent, puzzled and half-convinced by the argument,\nand Dr. Merkle promptly followed up her advantage. “I didn't ask you for\nyour brooch, my dear. I'd a good deal ruther folks paid me my regular\ncharge than have 'em put me to all this trouble.”\n\nShe paused, and Charity, seized with a desperate longing to escape, rose\nto her feet and held out one of the bills.\n\n“Will you take that?” she asked.\n\n“No, I won't take that, my dear; but I'll take it with its mate, and\nhand you over a signed receipt if you don't trust me.”\n\n“Oh, but I can't--it's all I've got,” Charity exclaimed.\n\nDr. Merkle looked up at her pleasantly from the plush sofa. “It seems\nyou got married yesterday, up to the 'Piscopal church; I heard all about\nthe wedding from the minister's chore-man. It would be a pity, wouldn't\nit, to let Mr. Royall know you had an account running here? I just put\nit to you as your own mother might.”\n\nAnger flamed up in Charity, and for an instant she thought of abandoning\nthe brooch and letting Dr. Merkle do her worst. But how could she leave\nher only treasure with that evil woman? She wanted it for her baby: she\nmeant it, in some mysterious way, to be a link between Harney's child\nand its unknown father. Trembling and hating herself while she did it,\nshe laid Mr. Royall's money on the table, and catching up the brooch\nfled out of the room and the house....\n\nIn the street she stood still, dazed by this last adventure. But the\nbrooch lay in her bosom like a talisman, and she felt a secret lightness\nof heart. It gave her strength, after a moment, to walk on slowly in the\ndirection of the post office, and go in through the swinging doors. At\none of the windows she bought a sheet of letter-paper, an envelope and a\nstamp; then she sat down at a table and dipped the rusty post office pen\nin ink. She had come there possessed with a fear which had haunted her\never since she had felt Mr. Royall's ring on her finger: the fear that\nHarney might, after all, free himself and come back to her. It was a\npossibility which had never occurred to her during the dreadful hours\nafter she had received his letter; only when the decisive step she had\ntaken made longing turn to apprehension did such a contingency seem\nconceivable. She addressed the envelope, and on the sheet of paper she\nwrote:\n\n\nI'm married to Mr. Royall. I'll always remember you. CHARITY.\n\n\nThe last words were not in the least what she had meant to write; they\nhad flowed from her pen irresistibly. She had not had the strength to\ncomplete her sacrifice; but, after all, what did it matter? Now that\nthere was no chance of ever seeing Harney again, why should she not tell\nhim the truth?\n\nWhen she had put the letter in the box she went out into the busy sunlit\nstreet and began to walk to the hotel. Behind the plateglass windows of\nthe department stores she noticed the tempting display of dresses and\ndress-materials that had fired her imagination on the day when she and\nHarney had looked in at them together. They reminded her of Mr. Royall's\ninjunction to go out and buy all she needed. She looked down at her\nshabby dress, and wondered what she should say when he saw her coming\nback empty-handed. As she drew near the hotel she saw him waiting on the\ndoorstep, and her heart began to beat with apprehension.\n\nHe nodded and waved his hand at her approach, and they walked through\nthe hall and went upstairs to collect their possessions, so that Mr.\nRoyall might give up the key of the room when they went down again for\ntheir midday dinner. In the bedroom, while she was thrusting back into\nthe satchel the few things she had brought away with her, she suddenly\nfelt that his eyes were on her and that he was going to speak. She stood\nstill, her half-folded night-gown in her hand, while the blood rushed up\nto her drawn cheeks.\n\n“Well, did you rig yourself out handsomely? I haven't seen any bundles\nround,” he said jocosely.\n\n“Oh, I'd rather let Ally Hawes make the few things I want,” she\nanswered.\n\n“That so?” He looked at her thoughtfully for a moment and his eye-brows\nprojected in a scowl. Then his face grew friendly again. “Well, I wanted\nyou to go back looking stylisher than any of them; but I guess you're\nright. You're a good girl, Charity.”\n\nTheir eyes met, and something rose in his that she had never seen there:\na look that made her feel ashamed and yet secure.\n\n“I guess you're good, too,” she said, shyly and quickly. He smiled\nwithout answering, and they went out of the room together and dropped\ndown to the hall in the glittering lift.\n\nLate that evening, in the cold autumn moonlight, they drove up to the\ndoor of the red house."
