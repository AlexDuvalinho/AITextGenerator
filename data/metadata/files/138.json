Of\nwhat use is literary history? It is not only a kind of museum, in which\na few masterpieces are preserved for the pleasure of beholders. It is\nthis certainly, but it is still more than this. Fine books are, before\nanything else, living works. They not only have lived, but they continue\nto live. They live within us, underneath those ideas which form our\nconscience and those sentiments which inspire our actions. There is\nnothing of greater importance for any society than to make an inventory\nof the ideas and the sentiments which are composing its moral atmosphere\nevery instant that it exists. For every individual this work is the very\ncondition of his dignity. The question is, should we have these ideas\nand these sentiments, if, in the times before us, there had not been\nsome exceptional individuals who seized them, as it were, in the air and\nmade them viable and durable? These exceptional individuals were capable\nof thinking more vigorously, of feeling more deeply, and of expressing\nthemselves more forcibly than we are. They bequeathed these ideas\nand sentiments to us. Literary history is, then, above and beyond all\nthings, the perpetual examination of the conscience of humanity.\n\nThere is no need for me to repeat what every one knows, the fact that\nour epoch is extremely complex, agitated and disturbed. In the midst of\nthis labyrinth in which we are feeling our way with such difficulty, who\ndoes not look back regretfully to the days when life was more simple,\nwhen it was possible to walk towards a goal, mysterious and unknown\nthough it might be, by straight paths and royal routes?\n\nGeorge Sand wrote for nearly half a century. For fifty times three\nhundred and sixty-five days, she never let a day pass by without\ncovering more pages than other writers in a month. Her first books\nshocked people, her early opinions were greeted with storms. From that\ntime forth she rushed head-long into everything new, she welcomed\nevery chimera and passed it on to us with more force and passion in it.\nVibrating with every breath, electrified by every storm, she looked up\nat every cloud behind which she fancied she saw a star shining. The work\nof another novelist has been called a repertory of human documents. But\nwhat a repertory of ideas her work was! She has said what she had to say\non nearly every subject; on love, the family, social institutions and on\nthe various forms of government. And with all this she was a woman.\nHer case is almost unique in the history of letters. It is intensely\ninteresting to study the influence of this woman of genius on the\nevolution of modern thought.\n\nI shall endeavour to approach my subject conscientiously and with all\ndue respect. I shall study biography where it is indispensable for the\ncomplete understanding of works. I shall give a sketch of the original\nindividuals I meet on my path, portraying these only at their point\nof contact with the life of our authoress, and it seems to me that\na gallery in which we see Sandeau, Sainte-Beuve, Musset, Michel (of\nBourges), Liszt, Chopin, Lamennais, Pierre Leroux, Dumas _fils_,\nFlaubert and many, many others is an incomparable portrait gallery. I\nshall not attack persons, but I shall discuss ideas and, when necessary,\ndispute them energetically. We shall, I hope, during our voyage, see\nmany perspectives open out before us.\n\nI have, of course, made use of all the works devoted to George Sand\nwhich were of any value for my study, and among others of the two\nvolumes published, under the name of Wladimir Karenine,(1) by a woman\nbelonging to Russian aristocratic society. For the period before\n1840, this is the most complete work that has been written. M. Samuel\nRocheblave, a clever University professor and the man who knows more\nthan any one about the life and works of George Sand, has been my guide\nand has helped me greatly with his wise advice. Private collections\nof documents have also been placed at my service most generously. I am\ntherefore able to supply some hitherto unpublished writings. George Sand\npublished, in all, about a hundred volumes of novels and stories, four\nvolumes of autobiography, and six of correspondence. In spite of all\nthis we are still asked for fresh documents.\n\n     (1) WLADIMIR KARENINE:  _George Sand, Sa vie et ses\n     oeuvres._ 2 Vols.  Ollendorf.\n\nIt is interesting, as a preliminary study, to note the natural gifts,\nand the first impressions of Aurore Dupin as a child and young girl, and\nto see how these predetermined the woman and the writer known to us as\nGeorge Sand.\n\nLucile-Amandine-Aurore Dupin, legitimate daughter of Maurice Dupin and\nof Sophie-Victoire Delaborde, was born in Paris, at 15 Rue Meslay, in\nthe neighbourhood of the Temple, on the 1st of July, 1804. I would call\nattention at once to the special phenomenon which explains the problem\nof her destiny: I mean by this her heredity, or rather the radical and\nviolent contrast of her maternal and paternal heredity.\n\nBy her father she was an aristocrat and related to the reigning houses.\n\nHer ancestor was the King of Poland, Augustus II, the lover of the\nbeautiful Countess Aurora von Koenigsmarck. George Sand's grandfather\nwas Maurice de Saxe. He may have been an adventurer and a _condottiere_,\nbut France owes to him Fontenoy, that brilliant page of her history.\nAll this takes us back to the eighteenth century with its brilliant,\ngallant, frivolous, artistic and profligate episodes. Maurice de Saxe\nadored the theatre, either for itself or for the sake of the women\nconnected with it. On his campaign, he took with him a theatrical\ncompany which gave a representation the evening before a battle. In this\ncompany was a young artiste named Mlle. de Verrieres whose father was\na certain M. Rinteau. Maurice de Saxe admired the young actress and a\ndaughter was born of this _liaison_, who was later on recognized by\nher father and named Marie-Aurore de Saxe. This was George Sand's\ngrandmother. At the age of fifteen the young girl married Comte de Horn,\na bastard son of Louis XV. This husband was obliging enough to his wife,\nwho was only his wife in name, to die as soon as possible. She then\nreturned to her mother \"the Opera lady.\" An elderly nobleman, Dupin de\nFrancueil, who had been the lover of the other Mlle. Verrieres, now\nfell in love with her and married her. Their son, Maurice Dupin, was\nthe father of our novelist. The astonishing part of this series\nof adventures is that Marie-Aurore should have been the eminently\nrespectable woman that she was. On her mother's side, though, Aurore\nDupin belonged to the people. She was the daughter of Sophie-Victoire\nDelaborde milliner, the grandchild of a certain bird-seller on the\nQuai des Oiseaux, who used to keep a public-house, and she was the\ngreat-granddaughter of Mere Cloquart.\n\nThis double heredity was personified in the two women who shared George\nSand's childish affection. We must therefore study the portraits of\nthese two women.\n\nThe grandmother was, if not a typical _grande dame_, at least a typical\nelegant woman of the latter half of the eighteenth century. She was very\nwell educated and refined, thanks to living with the two sisters, Mlles.\nVerrieres, who were accustomed to the best society. She was a good\nmusician and sang delightfully. When she married Dupin de Francueil, her\nhusband was sixty-two, just double her age. But, as she used to say\nto her granddaughter, \"no one was ever old in those days. It was the\nRevolution that brought old age into the world.\"\n\nDupin was a very agreeable man. When younger he had been _too_\nagreeable, but now he was just sufficiently so to make his wife very\nhappy. He was very lavish in his expenditure and lived like a prince,\nso that he left Marie-Aurore ruined and poor with about three thousand a\nyear. She was imbued with the ideas of the philosophers and an enemy of\nthe Queen's _coterie_. She was by no means alarmed at the Revolution and\nwas very soon taken prisoner. She was arrested on the 26th of November,\n1793, and incarcerated in the _Couvent des Anglaises_, Rue des\nFosse's-Saint-Victor, which had been converted into a detention house.\nOn leaving prison she settled down at Nohant, an estate she had recently\nbought. It was there that her granddaughter remembered her in her early\ndays. She describes her as tall, slender, fair and always very calm. At\nNohant she had only her maids and her books for company. When in Paris,\nshe delighted in the society of people of her own station and of her\ntime, people who had the ideas and airs of former days. She continued,\nin this new century, the shades of thought and the manners and Customs\nof the old _regime._\n\nAs a set-off to this woman of race and of culture, Aurore's mother\nrepresented the ordinary type of the woman of the people. She was small,\ndark, fiery and violent. She, too, the bird-seller's daughter, had been\nimprisoned by the Revolution, and strangely enough in the _Couvent des\nAnglaises_ at about the same time as Maurice de Saxe's granddaughter.\nIt was in this way that the fusion of classes was understood under the\nTerror. She was employed as a _figurante_ in a small theatre. This was\nmerely a commencement for her career. At the time when Maurice Dupin met\nher, she was the mistress of an old general. She already had one child\nof doubtful parentage. Maurice Dupin, too, had a natural son, named\nHippolyte, so that they could not reproach each other. When Maurice\nDupin married Sophie-Victoire, a month before the birth of Aurore, he\nhad some difficulty in obtaining his mother's consent. She finally\ngave in, as she was of an indulgent nature. It is possible that\nSophie-Victoire's conduct was irreproachable during her husband's\nlifetime, but, after his death, she returned to her former ways. She was\nnevertheless of religious habits and would not, upon any account, have\nmissed attending Mass. She was quick-tempered, jealous and noisy and,\nwhen anything annoyed her, extremely hot-headed. At such times she would\nshout and storm, so that the only way to silence her was to shout still\nmore loudly. She never bore any malice, though, and wished no harm\nto those she had insulted. She was of course sentimental, but more\npassionate than tender, and she quickly forgot those whom she had loved\nmost fondly. There seemed to be gaps in her memory and also in her\nconscience. She was ignorant, knowing nothing either of literature or of\nthe usages of society. Her _salon_ was the landing of her flat and her\nacquaintances were the neighbours who happened to live next door to her.\nIt is easy to imagine what she thought of the aristocrats who visited\nher mother-in-law. She was amusing when she joked and made parodies\non the women she styled \"the old Countesses.\" She had a great deal of\nnatural wit, a liveliness peculiar to the native of the faubourgs, all\nthe impudence of the street arab, and a veritable talent of mimicry.\nShe was a good housewife, active, industrious and most clever in turning\neverything to account. With a mere nothing she could improvise a dress\nor a hat and give it a certain style. She was always most skilful with\nher fingers, a typical Parisian work-girl, a daughter of the street and\na child of the people. In our times she would be styled \"a midinette.\"\n\nSuch are the two women who shared the affection of Aurore Dupin. Fate\nhad brought them together, but had made them so unlike that they were\nbound to dislike each other. The childhood of little Aurore served as\nthe lists for their contentions. Their rivalry was the dominating note\nin the sentimental education of the child.\n\nAs long as Maurice Dupin lived, Aurore was always with her parents in\ntheir little Parisian dwelling. Maurice Dupin was a brilliant officer,\nand very brave and jovial. In 1808, Aurore went to him in Madrid, where\nhe was Murat's _aide-de-camp_. She lived in the palace of the Prince\nof Peace, that vast palace which Murat filled with the splendour of his\ncostumes and the groans caused by his suffering. Like Victor Hugo,\nwho went to the same place at about the same time and under similar\nconditions, Aurore may have brought back with her:\n\n     _de ses courses lointaines_\n     _Comme un vaguefaisceau de lueurs incertaines._\n\nThis does not seem probable, though. The return was painful, as they\ncame back worried and ill, and were glad to take refuge at Nohant.\nThey were just beginning to organize their life when Maurice Dupin died\nsuddenly, from an accident when riding, leaving his mother and his wife\ntogether.\n\nFrom this time forth, Aurore was more often with her grandmother at\nNohant than with her mother in Paris. Her grandmother undertook the care\nof her education. Her half-brother, Hippolyte Chatiron, and she received\nlessons from M. Deschartres, who had educated Maurice Dupin. He was\nsteward and tutor combined, a very authoritative man, arrogant and a\ngreat pedant. He was affectionate, though, and extremely devoted. He\nwas both detestable and touching at the same time, and had a warm heart\nhidden under a rough exterior. Nohant was in the heart of Berry, and\nthis meant the country and Nature. For Aurore Dupin Nature proved to be\nan incomparable educator.\n\nThere was only one marked trait in the child's character up to this\ndate, and that was a great tendency to reverie. For long hours she would\nremain alone, motionless, gazing into space. People were anxious about\nher when they saw her looking so _stupid_, but her mother invariably\nsaid: \"Do not be alarmed. She is always ruminating about something.\"\nCountry life, while providing her with fresh air and plenty of exercise,\nso that her health was magnificent, gave fresh food and another turn to\nher reveries. Ten years earlier Alphonse de Lamartine had been sent\nto the country at Milly, and allowed to frequent the little peasant\nchildren of the place. Aurore Dupin's existence was now very much the\nsame as that of Lamartine. Nohant is situated in the centre of the Black\nValley. The ground is dark and rich; there are narrow, shady paths. It\nis not a hilly country, and there are wide, peaceful horizons. At all\nhours of the day and at all seasons of the year, Aurore wandered along\nthe Berry roads with her little playfellows, the farmers' children.\nThere was Marie who tended the flock, Solange who collected leaves, and\nLiset and Plaisir who minded the pigs. She always knew in what meadow or\nin what place she would find them. She played with them amongst the hay,\nclimbed the trees and dabbled in the water. She minded the flock with\nthem, and in winter, when the herdsmen talked together, assembled round\ntheir fire, she listened to their wonderful stories. These credulous\ncountry children had \"seen with their own eyes\" Georgeon, the evil\nspirit of the Black Valley. They had also seen will-o'-the-wisps,\nghosts, the \"white greyhound\" and the \"Big Beast\"! In the evenings, she\nsat up listening to the stories told by the hemp-weaver. Her fresh\nyoung soul was thus impregnated at an early age with the poetry of the\ncountry. And it was all the poetry of the country, that which comes from\nthings, such as the freshness of the air and the perfume of the flowers,\nbut also that which is to be found in the simplicity of sentiments and\nin that candour and surprise face to face with those sights of Nature\nwhich have remained the same and have been just as incomprehensible ever\nsince the beginning of the world.\n\nThe antagonism of the two mothers increased, though. We will not go into\ndetail with regard to the various episodes, but will only consider the\nconsequences.\n\nThe first consequence was that the intelligence of the child became more\nkeen through this duality. Placed as she was, in these two different\nworlds, between two persons with minds so unlike, and, obliged as she\nwas to go from one to the other, she learnt to understand and appreciate\nthem both, contrasts though they were. She had soon reckoned each of\nthem up, and she saw their weaknesses, their faults, their merits and\ntheir advantages.\n\nA second consequence was to increase her sensitiveness. Each time that\nshe left her mother, the separation was heartrending. When she was\nabsent from her, she suffered on account of this absence, and still more\nbecause she fancied that she would be forgotten. She loved her mother,\njust as she was, and the idea that any one was hostile or despised her\ncaused the child much silent suffering. It was as though she had an\never-open wound.\n\nAnother consequence, and by no means the least important one, was to\ndetermine in a certain sense the immense power of sympathy within her.\nFor a long time she only felt a sort of awe, when with her reserved and\nceremonious grandmother. She felt nearer to her mother, as there was\nno need to be on ceremony with her. She took a dislike to all those who\nrepresented authority, rules and the tyranny of custom. She considered\nher mother and herself as oppressed individuals. A love for the people\nsprang up in the heart of the daughter of Sophie-Victoire. She belonged\nto them through her mother, and she was drawn to them now through the\nhumiliations she underwent. In this little enemy of reverences and of\nsociety people, we see the dawn of that instinct which, later on, was to\ncause her to revolt openly. George Sand was quite right in saying,\nlater on, that it was of no use seeking any intellectual reason as the\nexplanation of her social preferences. Everything in her was due to\nsentiment. Her socialism was entirely the outcome of her suffering and\ntorments as a child.\n\nThings had to come to a crisis, and the crisis was atrocious. George\nSand gives an account of the tragic scene in her _Histoire de ma vie_.\nHer grandmother had already had one attack of paralysis. She was anxious\nabout Aurore's future, and wished to keep her from the influence of her\nmother. She therefore decided to employ violent means to this end. She\nsent for the child to her bedside, and, almost beside herself, in a\nchoking voice, she revealed to her all that she ought to have concealed.\nShe told her of Sophie-Victoire's past, she uttered the fatal word\nand spoke of the child's mother as a lost woman. With Aurore's extreme\nsensitiveness, it was horrible to receive such confidences at the age of\nthirteen. Thirty years later, George Sand describes the anguish of the\nterrible minute. \"It was a nightmare,\" she says. \"I felt choked, and it\nwas as though every word would kill me. The perspiration came out on my\nface. I wanted to interrupt her, to get up and rush away. I did not want\nto hear the frightful accusation. I could not move, though; I seemed to\nbe nailed on my knees, and my head seemed to be bowed down by that voice\nthat I heard above me, a voice which seemed to wither me like a storm\nwind.\"\n\nIt seems extraordinary that a woman, who was in reality so kind-hearted\nand so wise, should have allowed herself to be carried away like this.\nPassion has these sudden and unexpected outbursts, and we see here a\nmost significant proof of the atmosphere of passion in which the child\nhad lived, and which gradually insinuated itself within her.\n\nUnder these circumstances, Aurore's departure for the convent was a\ndeliverance. Until just recently, there has always been a convent in\nvogue in France in which it has been considered necessary for girls in\ngood society to be educated. In 1817, _the Couvent des Anglaises_ was in\nvogue, the very convent which had served as a prison for the mother\nand grandmother of Aurore. The three years she spent there in that \"big\nfeminine family, where every one was as kind as God,\" she considered the\nmost peaceful and happy time of her life. The pages she devotes to them\nin her _Histoire de ma vie_ have all the freshness of an oasis.\nShe describes most lovingly this little world, apart, exclusive and\nself-sufficing, in which life was so intense.\n\nThe house consisted of a number of constructions, and was situated\nin the neighbourhood given up to convents. There were courtyards and\ngardens enough to make it seem like a small village. There was also\na labyrinth of passages above and underground, just as in one of\nAnne Radcliffe's novels. There were old walls overgrown with vine and\njasmine. The cock could be heard at midnight, just as in the heart of\nthe country, and there was a bell with a silvery tone like a woman's\nvoice. From her little cell, Aurore looked over the tops of the great\nchestnut trees on to Paris, so that the air so necessary for the lungs\nof a child accustomed to wanderings in the country was not lacking\nin her convent home. The pupils had divided themselves into three\ncategories: the _diables_, the good girls, who were the specially\npious ones, and the silly ones. Aurore took her place at once among\nthe _diables_. The great exploit of these convent girls consisted in\ndescending into the cellars, during recreation, and in sounding the\nwalls, in order to \"deliver the victim.\" There was supposed to be an\nunfortunate victim imprisoned and tortured by the good, kindhearted\nSisters. Alas! all the _diables_ sworn to the task in the _Couvent des\nAnglaises_ never succeeded in finding the victim, so that she must be\nthere still.\n\nVery soon, though, a sudden change-took place in Aurore's soul. It\nwould have been strange had it been otherwise. With so extraordinarily\nsensitive an organization, the new and totally different surroundings\ncould not fail to make an impression. The cloister, the cemetery, the\nlong services, the words of the ritual, murmured in the dimly-lighted\nchapel, and the piety that seems to hover in the air in houses where\nmany prayers have been offered up--all this acted on the young girl. One\nevening in August, she had gone into the church, which was dimly lighted\nby the sanctuary lamp. Through the open window came the perfume of\nhoneysuckle and the songs of the birds. There was a charm, a mystery\nand a solemn calm about everything, such as she had never before\nexperienced. \"I do not know what was taking place within me,\" she said,\nwhen describing this, later on, \"but I breathed an atmosphere that was\nindescribably delicious, and I seemed to be breathing it in my very\nsoul. Suddenly, I felt a shock through all my being, a dizziness came\nover me, and I seemed to be enveloped in a white light. I thought I\nheard a voice murmuring in my ear: _'Tolle Lege.'_ I turned round, and\nsaw that I was quite alone. . . .\"\n\nOur modern _psychiatres_ would say that she had had an hallucination of\nhearing, together with olfactory trouble. I prefer saying that she\nhad received the visit of grace. Tears of joy bathed her face and she\nremained there, sobbing for a long time.\n\nThe convent had therefore opened to Aurore another world of sentiment,\nthat of Christian emotion. Her soul was naturally religious, and the\ndryness of a philosophical education had not been sufficient for it. The\nconvent had now brought her the aliment for which she had instinctively\nlonged. Later on, when her faith, which had never been very enlightened,\nleft her, the sentiment remained. This religiosity, of Christian form,\nwas essential to George Sand.\n\nThe convent also rendered her another eminent service. In the _Histoire\nde ma vie_, George Sand retraces from memory the portraits of several of\nthe Sisters. She tells us of Madame Marie-Xavier, and of her despair\nat having taken the vows; of Sister Anne-Joseph, who was as kind as an\nangel and as silly as a goose; of the gentle Marie-Alicia, whose\nserene soul looked out of her blue eyes, a mirror of purity, and of the\nmystical Sister Helene, who had left home in spite of her family, in\nspite of the supplications and the sobs of her mother and sisters, and\nwho had passed over the body of a child on her way to God. It is like\nthis always. The costumes are the same, the hands are clasped in the\nsame manner, the white bands and the faces look equally pale, but\nunderneath this apparent uniformity what contrasts! It is the inner life\nwhich marks the differences so vigorously, and shows up the originality\nof each one. Aurore gradually discovered the diversity of all these\nsouls and the beauty of each one. She thought of becoming a nun, but\nher confessor did not advise this, and he was certainly wise. Her\ngrandmother, who had a philosopher's opinion of priests, blamed their\nfanaticism, and took her little granddaughter away from the convent.\nPerhaps she felt the need of affection for the few months she had still\nto live. At any rate, she certainly had this affection. One of the first\nresults of the larger perspicacity which Aurore had acquired at the\nconvent was to make her understand her grandmother at last. She was able\nnow to grasp the complex nature of her relative and to see the delicacy\nhidden under an appearance of great reserve. She knew now all that\nshe owed to her grandmother, but unfortunately it was one of those\ndiscoveries which are made too late.\n\nThe eighteen months which Aurore now passed at Nohant, until the death\nof her grandmother, are very important as regards her psychological\nbiography. She was seventeen years old, and a girl who was eager to live\nand very emotional. She had first been a child of Nature. Her convent\nlife had taken her away from Nature and accustomed her to falling back\non her own thoughts. Nature now took her back once more, and her beloved\nNohant feted her return.\n\n\"The trees were in flower,\" she says, \"the nightingales were singing,\nand, in the distance, I could hear the classic, solemn sound of the\nlabourers. My old friends, the big dogs, who had growled at me the\nevening before, recognized me again and were profuse in their caresses.\n. . .\"\n\nShe wanted to see everything again. The things themselves had not\nchanged, but her way of looking at them now was different. During her\nlong, solitary walks every morning, she enjoyed seeing the various\nlandscapes, sometimes melancholy-looking and sometimes delightful. She\nenjoyed, too, the picturesqueness of the various things she met, the\nflocks of cattle, the birds taking their flight, and even the sound of\nthe horses' feet splashing in the water. She enjoyed everything, in\na kind of voluptuous reverie which was no longer instinctive, but\nconscious and a trifle morbid.\n\nAdded to all this, her reading at this epoch was without any order or\nmethod. She read everything voraciously, mixing all the philosophers\nup together. She read Locke, Condillac, Montesquieu, Bossuet, Pascal,\nMontaigne, but she kept Rousseau apart from the others. She devoured\nthe books of the moralists and poets, La Bruyere, Pope, Milton, Dante,\nVirgil, Shakespeare. All this reading was too much for her and excited\nher brain. She had reserved Chateaubriand's _Rene_, and, on reading\nthat, she was overcome by the sadness which emanates from these\ndistressing pages. She was disgusted with life, and attempted to commit\nsuicide. She tried to drown herself, and only owed her life to the\nhealthy-mindedness of the good mare Colette, as the horse evidently had\nnot the same reasons as its young mistress for wishing to put an end to\nits days.\n\nAll this time Aurore was entirely free to please herself. Deschartres,\nwho had always treated her as a boy, encouraged her independence. It\nwas at his instigation that she dressed in masculine attire to go out\nshooting. People began to talk about her \"eccentricities\" at Landerneau,\nand the gossip continued as far as La Chatre. Added to this,\nAurore began to study osteology with a young man who lived in the\nneighbourhood, and it was said that this young man, Stephane Ajasson de\nGrandsaigne, gave her lessons in her own room. This was the climax.\n\nWe have a curious testimony as regards the state of the young girl's\nmind at this epoch. A review, entitled _Le Voile de pourpre_, published\nrecently, in its first number, a letter from Aurore to her mother, dated\nNovember 18, 1821. Her mother had evidently written to her on hearing\nthe gossip about her, and had probably enlarged upon it.\n\n\"You reproach me, mother, with neither having timidity, modesty,\nnor charm,\" she writes, \"or at least you suppose that I have these\nqualities, but that I refrain from showing them, and you are quite\ncertain that I have no outward decency nor decorum. You ought to know me\nbefore judging me in this way. You would then be able to form an opinion\nabout my conduct. Grandmother is here, and, ill though she is, she\nwatches over me carefully and lovingly, and she would not fail to\ncorrect me if she considered that I had the manners of a dragoon or of a\nhussar.\"\n\nShe considered that she had no need of any one to guide or protect her,\nand no need of leading-strings.\n\n\"I am seventeen,\" she says, \"and I know my way about.\"\n\nIf this Monsieur de Grandsaigne had ventured to take any liberty with\nher, she was old enough to take care of herself.\n\nHer mother had blamed her for learning Latin and osteology. \"Why should\na woman be ignorant?\" she asks. \"Can she not be well educated without\nthis spoiling her and without being pedantic? Supposing that I should\nhave sons in the future, and that I had profited sufficiently by my\nstudies to be able to teach them, would not a mother's lessons be as\ngood as a tutor's?\"\n\nShe was already challenging public opinion, starting a campaign against\nfalse prejudices, showing a tendency to generalize, and to make the\ncause of one woman the cause of all women.\n\nWe must now bear in mind the various traits we have discovered, one\nafter another, in Aurore's character. We must remember to what parentage\nshe owed her intellectuality and her sentimentality. It will then\nbe more easy to understand the terms she uses when describing her\nfascination for Rousseau's writings.\n\n\"The language of Jean-Jacques and the form of his deductions impressed\nme as music might have done when heard in brilliant sunshine. I compared\nhim to Mozart, and I understood everything.\"\n\nShe understood him, for she recognized herself in him. She sympathized\nwith that predominance of feeling and imagination, that exaggeration of\nsentiment, that preference for life according to Nature, that emotion\non beholding the various sights of the country, that distrust of people,\nthose effusions of religious sentimentality, those solitary reveries,\nand that melancholy which made death seem desirable to him. All this\nwas to Aurore Dupin the gospel according to Rousseau. The whole of her\npsychology is to be found here.\n\nShe was an exceptional being undoubtedly; but in order to be a genial\nexception one must have within oneself, and then personify with great\nintensity all the inspirations which, at a certain moment, are dispersed\nin the atmosphere. Ever since the great agitation which had shaken\nthe moral world by Rousseau's preaching, there had been various vague\ncurrents and a whole crowd of confused aspirations floating about.\nIt was this enormous wave that entered a feminine soul. Unconsciously\nAurore Dupin welcomed the new ideal, and it was this ideal which was\nto operate within her. The question was, what would she do with it,\nin presence of life with all its everyday and social realities. This\nquestion is the object of our study. In the solution of it lies the\ninterest, the drama and the lesson of George Sand's destiny.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nBARONNE DUDEVANT MARRIAGE AND FREEDOM--THE ARRIVAL IN PARIS--JULES\nSANDEAU\n\nWe must now endeavour to discover what the future George Sand's\nexperiences of marriage were, and the result of these experiences on the\nformation of her ideas.\n\n\"You will lose your best friend in me,\" were the last words of the\ngrandmother to her granddaughter on her death-bed. The old lady spoke\ntruly, and Aurore was very soon to prove this. By a clause in her will,\nMadame Dupin de Francueil left the guardianship of Aurore to a cousin,\nRene de Villeneuve. It was scarcely likely, though, that Sophie-Victoire\nshould consent to her own rights being frustrated by this illegal\nclause, particularly as this man belonged to the world of the \"old\nCountesses.\" She took her daughter with her to Paris. Unfortunately for\nher, Aurore's eyes were now open, and she was cultured enough to have\nbeen in entire sympathy with her exquisite grandmother. It was no longer\npossible for her to have the old passionate affection and indulgence for\nher mother, especially as she felt that she had hitherto been deserted\nby her. She saw her mother now just as she was, a light woman belonging\nto the people, a woman who could not resign herself to growing old. If\nonly Sophie-Victoire had been of a tranquil disposition! She was most\nrestless, on the contrary, wanting to change her abode and change her\nrestaurant every day. She would quarrel with people one day, make it up\nthe next; wear a different-shaped hat every day, and change the colour\nof her hair continually. She was always in a state of agitation. She\nloved police news and thrilling stories; read the _Sherlock Holmes_ of\nthose days until the middle of the night. She dreamed of such stories,\nand the following day went on living in an atmosphere of crime. When\nshe had an attack of indigestion, she always imagined that she had been\npoisoned. When a visitor arrived, she thought it must be a burglar.\nShe was most sarcastic about Aurore's \"fine education\" and her literary\naspirations. Her hatred of the dead grandmother was as strong as ever.\nShe was constantly insulting her memory, and in her fits of anger said\nunheard-of things. Aurore's silence was her only reply to these storms,\nand this exasperated her mother. She declared that she would correct her\ndaughter's \"sly ways.\" Aurore began to wonder with terror whether her\nmother's mind were not beginning to give way. The situation finally\nbecame intolerable.\n\nSophie-Victoire took her daughter to spend two or three days with some\nfriends of hers, and then left her there. They lived in the country at\nPlessis-Picard, near Melun. Aurore was delighted to find a vast park\nwith thickets in which there were roebucks bounding about. She loved\nthe deep glades and the water with the green reflections of old willow\ntrees. Monsieur James Duplessis and his wife, Angele, were excellent\npeople, and they adopted Aurore for the time being. They already had\nfive daughters, so that one more did not make much difference. They\nfrequented a few families in the neighbourhood, and there was plenty of\ngaiety among the young people. The Duplessis took Aurore sometimes to\nParis and to the theatre.\n\n\"One evening,\" we are told in the _Histoire de ma vie_, \"we were having\nsome ices at Tortoni's after the theatre, when suddenly my mother Angele\nsaid to her husband, 'Why, there's Casimir!' A young man, slender and\nrather elegant, with a gay expression and a military look, came and\nshook hands, and answered all the questions he was asked about his\nfather, Colonel Dudevant, who was evidently very much respected and\nloved by the family.\"\n\nThis was the first meeting, the first appearance of Casimir in the\nstory, and this was how he entered into the life of Aurore.\n\nHe was invited to Plessis, he joined the young people good-humouredly in\ntheir games, was friendly with Aurore, and, without posing as a suitor,\nasked for her hand in marriage. There was no reason for her to refuse\nhim. He was twenty-seven years of age, had served two years in the army,\nand had studied law in Paris. He was a natural son, of course, but he\nhad been recognized by his father, Colonel Dudevant. The Dudevant family\nwas greatly respected. They had a _chateau_ at Guillery in Gascony.\nCasimir had been well brought up and had good manners. Aurore might as\nwell marry him as any other young man. It would even be preferable to\nmarry him rather than another young man. He was already her friend, and\nhe would then be her husband. That would not make much difference.\n\nThe marriage almost fell through, thanks to Sophie-Victoire. She did\nnot consider Casimir good-looking enough. She was not thinking of her\ndaughter, but of herself. She had made up her mind to have a handsome\nson-in-law with whom she could go out. She liked handsome men, and\nparticularly military men. Finally she consented to the marriage, but, a\nfortnight before the ceremony, she arrived at Plessis, like a veritable\nthunderbolt. An extraordinary idea had occurred to her. She vowed that\nshe had discovered that Casimir had been a waiter at a _cafe_. She had\nno doubt dreamt this, but she held to her text, and was indignant at the\nidea of her daughter marrying a waiter! . . .\n\nThings had arrived at this crisis when Casimir's mother, Madame\nDudevant, who had all the manners of a _grande dame_, decided to pay\nSophie-Victoire an official visit. The latter was greatly flattered,\nfor she liked plenty of attention paid to her. It was in this way that\nAurore Dupin became Baronne Dudevant.\n\n\nShe was just eighteen years of age. It is interesting to read her\ndescription of herself at this time. In her _Voyage en Auvergne_, which\nwas her first writing, dated 1827, she traces the following portrait,\nwhich certainly is not exaggerated.\n\n\"When I was sixteen,\" she says, \"and left the convent, every one could\nsee that I was a pretty girl. I was fresh-looking, though dark. I was\nlike those wild flowers which grow without any art or culture, but with\ngay, lively colouring. I had plenty of hair, which was almost black. On\nlooking at myself in the glass, though, I can truthfully say that I was\nnot very well pleased with myself. I was dark, my features were well\ncut, but not finished. People said that it was the expression of my face\nthat made it interesting. I think this was true. I was gay but dreamy,\nand my most natural expression was a meditative one. People said, too,\nthat in this absent-minded expression there was a fixed look which\nresembled that of the serpent when fascinating his prey. That, at any\nrate, was the far-fetched comparison of my provincial adorers.\"\n\nThey were not very far wrong, these provincial adorers. The portraits\nof Aurore at this date show us a charming face of a young girl,\nas fresh-looking as a child. She has rather long features, with a\ndelicately-shaped chin. She is not exactly pretty, but fascinating, with\nthose great dark eyes, which were her prominent feature, eyes which,\nwhen fixed on any one, took complete possession of them--dreamy,\npassionate eyes, sombre because the soul reflected in them had profound\ndepths.\n\nIt is difficult to define that soul, for it was so complex. To judge by\nappearances, it was a very peaceful soul, and perhaps, too, it was in\nreality peaceful. George Sand, who knew herself thoroughly, frequently\nspoke of her laziness and of her apathy, traits peculiar to the natives\nof Berry. Superficial observers looked no further, and her mother used\nto call her \"St. Tranquillity.\" The nuns, though, of her convent had\nmore perspicacity. They said, when speaking of her: \"Still waters run\ndeep.\" Under the smooth surface they fancied that storms were gathering.\nAurore had within her something of her mother and of her grandmother,\nand their opposite natures were blended in her. She had the calmness of\nMarie-Aurore, but she also had the impetuousness of Sophie-Victoire,\nand undoubtedly, too, something of the free and easy good humour of her\nfather, the break-neck young officer. It certainly is not surprising to\nfind a love of adventure in a descendant of Maurice de Saxe.\n\nBeside all these inner contrasts, the observer was particularly struck\nby her sudden changes of humour, by the way in which, after a fit of\nmelancholy sadness, she suddenly gave way to the most exuberant gaiety,\nfollowed by long fits of depression and nervous exhaustion. Personally,\nI do not believe much in the influence of the physical over the moral\nnature, but I am fully convinced of the action of the moral over\nthe physical nature. In certain cases and in presence of extremely\naccentuated conditions, physiological explanations must be taken into\naccount. All these fits of melancholy and weeping, this prostration,\nthese high spirits and the long walks, in order to sober down, denote\nthe exigencies of an abnormal temperament. When once the crisis was\npassed, it must not be supposed that, as with many other people, nothing\nremained of it all. This was by no means the case, as in a nature so\nextraordinarily organized for storing up sensations nothing was lost,\nnothing evaporated, and everything increased. The still water seemed\nto be slumbering. Its violence, though held in check, was increasing in\nforce, and when once let loose, it would carry all before it.\n\nSuch was the woman whom Casimir Dudevant was to marry. The fascination\nwas great; the honour rather to be feared, for all depended on his skill\nin guiding this powerful energy.\n\nThe question is whether he loved her. It has been said that it was a\nmarriage of interest, as Aurore's fortune amounted to twenty thousand\npounds, and he was by no means rich. This may have been so, but there is\nno reason why money should destroy one's sentiments, and the fact that\nAurore had money was not likely to prevent Casimir from appreciating\nthe charms of a pretty girl. It seems, therefore, very probable that he\nloved his young wife, at any rate as much as this Casimir was capable of\nloving his wife.\n\nThe next question is whether she loved him. It has been said that she\ndid, simply because she declared that she did not. When, later on, after\nher separation, she spoke of her marriage, all her later grievances were\nprobably in her mind. There are her earlier letters, though, which some\npeople consider a proof that she cared for Casimir, and there are also a\nfew words jotted down in her notebook. When her husband was absent, she\nwas anxious about him and feared that he had met with an accident.\nIt would be strange indeed if a girl of eighteen did not feel some\naffection for the man who had been the first to make love to her, a man\nwhom she had married of her own free-will. It is rare for a woman to\nfeel no kind of attachment for her husband, but is that attachment love?\nWhen a young wife complains of her husband, we hear in her reproaches\nthe protest of her offended dignity, of her humbled pride. When a woman\nloves her husband, though, she does not reproach him, guilty though he\nmay be, with having humiliated and wounded her. What she has against him\nthen, is that he has broken her heart by his lack of love for her. This\nnote and this accent can never be mistaken, and never once do we find\nit with Aurore. We may therefore conclude that she had never loved her\nhusband.\n\nCasimir did not know how to win her affection. He did not even realize\nthat he needed to win it. He was very much like all men. The idea never\noccurs to them that, when once they are married, they have to win their\nwife.\n\nHe was very much like all men. . . . That is the most faithful portrait\nthat can be traced of Casimir at this epoch. He had not as yet the vices\nwhich developed in him later on. He had nothing to distinguish him from\nthe average man. He was selfish, without being disagreeable, rather\nidle, rather incapable, rather vain and rather foolish. He was just\nan ordinary man. The wife he had married, though, was not an ordinary\nwoman. That was their misfortune. As Emile Faguet has very wittily put\nit, \"Monsieur Dudevant, about whom she complained so much, seems to have\nhad no other fault than that of being merely an ordinary man, which, of\ncourse, is unendurable to a superior woman. The situation was perhaps\nequally unendurable for the man.\" This is quite right, for Casimir was\nvery soon considerably disconcerted. He was incapable of understanding\nher psychology, and, as it seemed impossible to him that a woman was\nnot his inferior, he came to the logical conclusion that his wife was\n\"idiotic.\" This was precisely his expression, and at every opportunity\nhe endeavoured to crush her by his own superiority. All this seems to\nthrow some light on his character and also on the situation. Here was\na man who had married the future George Sand, and he complained, in all\ngood faith, that his wife was \"idiotic\"!\n\nCertainly, on comparing the _Correspondance_ with the _Histoire de ma\nvie_, the difference of tone is most striking. The letters in\nwhich Baronne Dudevant tells, day by day, of her home life are too\nenthusiastic for the letters of an unhappy wife. There are receptions at\nNohant, lively dinners, singing and dancing. All this is, at any rate,\nthe surface, but gradually the misunderstandings are more pronounced,\nand the gulf widens.\n\nThere may have been a misunderstanding at the very beginning of their\nmarried life, and Aurore may have had a surprise of the nature of the\none to which Jane de Simerose confesses in _L'Ami des femmes_. In an\nunpublished letter written much later on, in the year 1843, from George\nSand to her half-brother Hippolyte Chatiron on the occasion of his\ndaughter's engagement, the following lines occur: \"See that your\nson-in-law is not brutal to your daughter the first night of their\nmarriage. . . . Men have no idea that this amusement of theirs is a\nmartyrdom for us. Tell him to sacrifice his own pleasure a little, and\nto wait until he has taught his wife gradually to understand things\nand to be willing. There is nothing so frightful as the horror, the\nsuffering and the disgust of a poor girl who knows nothing and who is\nsuddenly violated by a brute. We bring girls up as much as possible like\nsaints, and then we hand them over like fillies. If your son-in-law\nis an intelligent man and if he really loves your daughter, he will\nunderstand his _role_, and will not take it amiss that you should speak\nto him beforehand.\"(2)\n\n     (2) Communicated by M. S. Rocheblave.\n\nIs George Sand recalling here any hidden and painful memories? Casimir\nhad, at bottom, a certain brutality, which, later on, was very evident.\nThe question is whether he had shown proofs of it at a time when it\nwould have been wiser to have refrained.\n\nHowever that may be, the fundamental disagreement of their natures was\nnot long in making itself felt between the husband and wife. He was\nmatter-of-fact, and she was romantic; he only believed in facts, and\nshe in ideas; he was of the earth, earthy, whilst she aspired to the\nimpossible. They had nothing to say to each other, and when two people\nhave nothing to say, and love does not fill up the silences, what\ntorture the daily _tete-a-tete_ must be. Before they had been married\ntwo years, they were bored to death. They blamed Nohant, but the fault\nwas in themselves. Nohant seemed unbearable to them, simply because they\nwere there alone with each other. They went to Plessis, perhaps in the\nhope that the remembrance of the days of their engagement might have\nsome effect on them. It was there, in 1824, that the famous scene of the\nblow took place. They were playing at a regular children's game in the\npark, and throwing sand at each other. Casimir lost his patience and\nstruck his wife. It was certainly impolite, but Aurore did not appear\nto have been very indignant with her husband at the time. Her grievances\nwere quite of another kind, less tangible and much more deeply felt.\n\nFrom Plessis they went to Ormesson. We do not know what took place\nthere, but evidently something which made a deep impression morally,\nsomething very serious. A few years later, referring to this stay at\nOrmesson, George Sand wrote to one of her friends: \"You pass by a wall\nand come to a house. . . . If you are allowed to enter you will find a\ndelightful English garden, at the bottom of which is a spring of water\nhidden under a kind of grotto. It is all very stiff and uninteresting,\nbut it is very lonely. I spent several months there, and it was there\nthat I lost my health, my confidence in the future, my gaiety and my\nhappiness. It was there that I felt, and very deeply too, my first\napproach of trouble. . . .\"(3)\n\n     (3) Extract from the unpublished letters of George Sand to\n     Dr. Emile Regnault.\n\nThey left Ormesson for Paris, and Paris for Nohant, and after that, by\nway of trying to shake off the dulness that was oppressing them, they\nhad recourse to the classical mode of diversion--a voyage.\n\n\nThey set off on the 5th of July, 1825, for that famous expedition to the\nPyrenees, which was to be so important a landmark in Aurore Dudevant's\nhistory. On crossing the Pyrenees, the scenery, so new to her--or\nrather the memory of which had been lying dormant in her mind since\nher childhood--filled her with wild enthusiasm. This intense emotion\ncontributed to develop within her that sense of the picturesque which,\nlater on, was to add so considerably to her talent as a writer. She had\nhitherto been living in the country of plains, the Ile-de-France and\nBerry. The contrast made her realize all the beauties of nature, and,\non her return, she probably understood her own familiar scenery, and\nenjoyed it all the more. She had hitherto appreciated it vaguely.\nLamartine learnt to love the severe scenery of Milly better on returning\nto it after the softness of Italy.\n\nThe Pyrenees served, too, for Baronne Dudevant as the setting for an\nepisode which was unique in her sentimental life.\n\nIn the _Histoire de ma vie_ there is an enigmatical page in which George\nSand has intentionally measured and veiled every expression. She speaks\nof her moral solitude, which, at that time, was profound and absolute,\nand she adds: \"It would have been mortal to a tender mind and to a girl\nin the flower of her youth, if it had not been filled with a dream which\nhad taken the importance of a great passion, not in my life, as I had\nsacrificed my life to duty, but in my thoughts. I was in continual\ncorrespondence with an absent person to whom I told all my thoughts, all\nmy dreams, who knew all my humble virtues, and who heard all my platonic\nenthusiasm. This person was excellent in reality, but I attributed to\nhim more than all the perfections possible to human nature. I only saw\nthis man for a few days, and sometimes only for a few hours, in the\ncourse of a year. He was as romantic, in his intercourse with me, as I\nwas. Consequently he did not cause me any scruples, either of religion\nor of conscience. This man was the stay and consolation of my exile,\nas regards the world of reality.\" It was this dream, as intense as any\npassion, that we must study here. We must make the acquaintance of this\nexcellent and romantic man.\n\nAurelien de Seze was a young magistrate, a few years older than Aurore.\nHe was twenty-six years of age and she was twenty-one. He was the\ngreat-nephew of the counsel who pleaded for Louis XVI. There was,\ntherefore, in his family a tradition of moral nobility, and the young\nman had inherited this. He had met Aurore at Bordeaux and again at\nCauterets. They had visited the grottoes of Lourdes together. Aurelien\nhad appreciated the young wife's charm, although she had not attempted\nto attract his attention, as she was not coquettish. She appreciated in\nhim--all that was so lacking in Casimir--culture of mind, seriousness of\ncharacter, discreet manners which people took at first for coldness, and\na somewhat dignified elegance. He was scrupulously honest, a magistrate\nof the old school, sure of his principles and master of himself. It was,\nprobably, just that which appealed to the young wife, who was a true\nwoman and who had always wished to be dominated. When they met again at\nBreda, they had an explanation. This was the \"violent grief\" of which\nGeorge Sand speaks. She was consoled by a friend, Zoe Leroy, who found\na way of calming this stormy soul. She came through this crisis crushed\nwith emotion and fatigue, but calm and joyful. They had vowed to love\neach other, but to remain without reproach, and their vow was faithfully\nkept.\n\nAurore, therefore, had nothing with which to reproach herself, but with\nher innate need of being frank, she considered it her duty to write a\nletter to her husband, informing him of everything. This was the\nfamous letter of November 8, 1825. Later on, in 1836, when her case for\nseparation from her husband was being heard, a few fragments of it were\nread by her husband's advocate with the idea of incriminating her. By\nway of reply to this, George Sand's advocate read the entire letter in\nall its eloquence and generosity. It was greeted by bursts of applause\nfrom the audience.\n\nAll this is very satisfactory. It is exactly the situation of the\nPrincess of Cleves in Madame de Lafayette's novel. The Princess of\nCleves acknowledges to her husband the love she cannot help feeling for\nMonsieur de Nemours, and asks for his help and advice as her natural\nprotector. This fine proceeding is usually admired, although it cost\nthe life of the Prince of Cleves, who died broken-hearted. Personally, I\nadmire it too, although at times I wonder whether we ought not rather\nto see in it an unconscious suggestion of perversity. This confession of\nlove to the person who is being, as it were, robbed of that love, is in\nitself a kind of secret pleasure. By speaking of the love, it becomes\nmore real, we bring it out to light instead of letting it die away in\nthose hidden depths within us, in which so many of the vague sentiments\nwhich we have not cared to define, even to ourselves, die away. Many\nwomen have preferred this more silent way, in which they alone have been\nthe sufferers. But such women are not the heroines of novels. No one has\nappreciated their sacrifice, and they themselves could scarcely tell all\nthat it has cost them.\n\nAurelien de Seze had taken upon himself the _role_ of confidant to this\nsoul that he had allotted to himself. He took his _role_ very seriously,\nas was his custom in all things. He became the young wife's director in\nall matters of conscience. The letters which he wrote to her have\nbeen preserved, and we know them by the extracts and the analysis that\nMonsieur Rocheblave has given us and by his incisive commentaries of\nthem.(4) They are letters of guidance, spiritual letters. The laic\nconfessor endeavours, before all things, to calm the impatience of this\nsoul which is more and more ardent and more and more troubled every day.\nHe battles with her about her mania of philosophizing, her wish to sift\neverything and to get to the bottom of everything. Strong in his own\ncalmness, he kept repeating to her in a hundred different ways the\nwords: \"Be calm!\" The advice was good; the only difficulty was the\nfollowing of the advice.\n\n     (4) \"George Sand avant George Sand,\" by S. Rocheblave\n     (_Revue de Paris_, December 15, 1894).\n\nGradually the professor lost his hold on his pupil, for it seems as\nthough Aurore were the first to tire. Aurelien finally began to doubt\nthe efficacy of his preaching. The usual fate of sentiments outside\nthe common order of things is that they last the length of time that a\ncrisis of enthusiasm lasts. The best thing that can happen then is that\ntheir nature should not change, that they should not deteriorate, as is\nso often the case. When they remain intact to the end, they leave behind\nthem, in the soul, a trail of light, a trail of cold, pure light.\n\nThe decline of this platonic _liaison_ with Aurelien de Seze dates from\n1828. Some grave events were taking place at Nohant about this time. For\nthe last few years Casimir had fallen into the vices of certain country\nsquires, or so-called gentlemen farmers. He had taken to drink, in\ncompany with Hippolyte Chatiron, and it seems that the intoxication\npeculiar to the natives of Berry takes a heavy and not a gay form. He\nhad also taken to other bad habits, away from home at first, and\nlater on under the conjugal roof. He was particularly partial to\nthe maid-servants, and, the day following the birth of her daughter,\nSolange, Aurore had an unpleasant surprise with regard to her husband.\nFrom that day forth, what had hitherto been only a vague wish on her\npart became a fixed idea with her, and she began to form plans. A\ncertain incident served as a pretext. When putting some papers in order,\nAurore came upon her husband's will. It was a mere diatribe, in which\nthe future \"deceased\" gave utterance to all his past grievances against\nhis _idiotic_ wife. Her mind was made up irrevocably from this moment.\nShe would have her freedom again; she would go to Paris and spend three\nmonths out of six there. She had a young tutor from the south of France,\nnamed Boucoiran, educating her children. This Boucoiran needed to be\ntaken to task constantly, and Baronne Dudevant did not spare him.(5)\n\n     (5) An instance of her disposition for lecturing will be\n     seen in the following curious letter sent by George Sand to\n     her friend and neighbour, Adolphe Duplomb.  This letter has\n     never been published before, and we owe our thanks for it to\n     Monsieur Charles Duplomb.\n\n     _Nohant, July_ 23,1830.\n\n     \"Are you so very much afraid of me, my poor Hydrogene?  You\n     expect a good lecture and you will not expect in vain.  Have\n     patience, though.  Before giving you the dressing you\n     deserve, I want to tell you that I have not forgotten you,\n     and that I was very vexed on returning from Paris, to find\n     my great simpleton of a son gone. I am so used to seeing\n     your solemn face that I quite miss it. You have a great many\n     faults, but after all, you are a good sort, and in time you\n     will get reasonable.  Try to remember occasionally, my dear\n     Plombeus, that you have friends.  If I were your only\n     friend, that would be a great deal, as I am to be depended\n     on, and am always at my post as a friend, although I may not\n     be very tender. I am not very polite either, as I speak the\n     truth plainly. That is my characteristic, though.  I am a\n     firm friend nevertheless, and to be depended on.  Do not\n     forget what I have said now, as I shall not often repeat\n     this.  Remember, too, that happiness in this world depends\n     on the interest and esteem that we inspire. I do not say\n     this to every one, as it would be impossible, but just to a\n     certain number of friends.  It is impossible to find one's\n     happiness entirely in one's self, without being an egoist,\n     and I do not think so badly of you that I imagine you to be\n     one. A man whom no one cares for is wretched, and the man\n     who has friends is afraid of grieving them by behaving\n     badly.  As Polyte says, all this is for the sake of letting\n     you know that you must do your best to behave well, if you\n     want to prove to me that you are not ungrateful for my\n     interest in you.  You ought to get rid of the bad habit of\n     boasting that you have adopted through frequenting young men\n     as foolish as yourself.  Do whatever your position and your\n     health allow you to do, provided that you do not compromise\n     the honour or the reputation of any one else. I do not see\n     that a young man is called upon to be as chaste as a nun.\n     But keep your good or bad luck in your love affairs to\n     yourself. Silly talk is always repeated, and it may chance\n     to get to the ears of sensible people who will disapprove.\n     Try, too, not to make so many plans, but to carry out just\n     one or two of them.  You know that is why I quarrel with you\n     always.  I should like to see more constancy in you.  You\n     tell Hippolyte that you are very willing and courageous.  As\n     to physical courage, of the kind that consists in enduring\n     illness and in not fearing death, I dare say you have that,\n     but I doubt very much whether you have the courage necessary\n     for sustained work, unless you have very much altered.\n     Everything fresh delights you, but after a little time you\n     only see the inconveniences of your position.  You will\n     scarcely find anything without something that is annoying\n     and troublesome, but if you cannot learn to put up with\n     things you will never be a man.\n\n     \"This is the end of my sermon.  I expect you have had enough\n     of it, especially as you are not accustomed to reading my\n     bad handwriting. I shall be glad to hear from you, but do\n     not consider your letter as a State affair, and do not\n     torment yourself to arrange well-turned phrases.  I do not\n     care for such phrases at all. A letter is always good enough\n     when the writer expresses himself naturally, and says what\n     he thinks.  Fine pages are all very well for the\n     schoolmaster, but I do not appreciate them at all. Promise\n     me to be reasonable, and to think of my sermons now and\n     then. That is all I ask.  You may be very sure that if it\n     were not for my friendship for you I should not take the\n     trouble to lecture you. I should be afraid of annoying you\n     if it were not for that. As it is, I am sure that you are\n     not displeased to have my lectures, and that you understand\n     the feeling which dictates them.\n\n     \"Adieu, my dear Adolphe.  Write to me often and tell me\n     always about your affairs.  Take care of yourself, and try\n     to keep well; but if you should feel ill come back to your\n     native place. There will always be milk and syrup for you,\n     and you know that I am not a bad nurse.  Every one wishes to\n     be remembered to you, and I send you my holy blessing.\n\n     \"AURORE D----\"\n\nShe considered him idle, and reproached him with his lack of dignity and\nwith making himself too familiar with his inferiors. She could not admit\nthis familiarity, although she was certainly a friend of the people\nand of the peasants. Between sympathy and familiarity there was a\ndistinction, and Aurore took care not to forget this. There was always\nsomething of the _grande dame_ in her. Boucoiran was devoted, though,\nand she counted on him for looking after her children, for keeping\nher strictly _au courant_, and letting her know in case of illness.\nPerfectly easy on this score, she could live in Paris on an income of\nsixty pounds by adding to it what she could earn.\n\nCasimir made no objections. All that happened later on in this\nexistence, which was from henceforth so stormy, happened with his\nknowledge and with his consent. He was a poor sort of man.\n\nLet us consider now, for a moment, Baronne Dudevant's impressions after\nsuch a marriage. We will not speak of her sadness nor of her disgust. In\na union of this kind, how could the sacred and beneficial character\nof marriage have appeared to her? A husband should be a companion.\nShe never knew the charm of true intimacy, nor the delight of thoughts\nshared with another. A husband is the counsellor, the friend. When she\nneeded counsel, she was obliged to go elsewhere for it, and it was from\nanother man that guidance and encouragement came. A husband should be\nthe head and, I do not hesitate to say, the master. Life is a ceaseless\nstruggle, and the man who has taken upon himself the task of defending a\nfamily from all the dangers which threaten its dissolution, from all the\nenemies which prowl around it, can only succeed in his task of protector\nif he be invested with just authority. Aurore had been treated brutally:\nthat is not the same thing as being dominated. The sensation which never\nleft her was that of an immense moral solitude. She could no longer\ndream in the Nohant avenues, for the old trees had been lopped, and the\nmystery chased away. She shut herself up in her grandmother's little\nboudoir, adjoining her children's room, so that she could hear them\nbreathing, and whilst Casimir and Hippolyte were getting abominably\nintoxicated, she sat there thinking things over, and gradually becoming\nso irritated that she felt the rebellion within her gathering force. The\nmatrimonial bond was a heavy yoke to her. A Christian wife would\nhave submitted to it and accepted it, but the Christianity of Baronne\nDudevant was nothing but religiosity. The trials of life show up the\ninsufficiency of religious sentiment which is not accompanied by faith.\nMarriage, without love, friendship, confidence and respect, was for\nAurore merely a prison. She endeavoured to escape from it, and when she\nsucceeded she uttered a sigh of relief at her deliverance.\n\nSuch, then, is the chapter of marriage in Baronne Dudevant's psychology.\nIt is a fine example of failure. The woman who had married badly now\nremained an individual, instead of harmonizing and blending in a general\nwhole. This ill-assorted union merely accentuated and strengthened\nGeorge Sand's individualism.\n\nAurore Dudevant arrived in Paris the first week of the year 1831. The\nwoman who was rebellious to marriage was now in a city which had just\nhad a revolution.\n\nThe extraordinary effervescence of Paris in 1831 can readily be\nimagined. There was tempest in the air, and this tempest was bound to\nbreak out here or there, either immediately or in the near future, in an\ninsurrection. Every one was feverishly anxious to destroy everything, in\norder to create all things anew. In everything, in art, ideas and even\nin costume, there was the same explosion of indiscipline, the same\ntriumph of capriciousness. Every day some fresh system of government was\nborn, some new method of philosophy, an infallible receipt for bringing\nabout universal happiness, an unheard-of idea for manufacturing\nmasterpieces, some invention for dressing up and having a perpetual\ncarnival in the streets. The insurrection was permanent and masquerade\na normal state. Besides all this, there was a magnificent burst of youth\nand genius. Victor Hugo, proud of having fought the battle of _Hernani_,\nwas then thinking of _Notre-Dame_ and climbing up to it. Musset had just\ngiven his _Contes d'Espagne el d'Italie_. Stendhal had published _Le\nRouge et le Noir_, and Balzac _La Peau de Chagrin_. The painters of the\nday were Delacroix and Delaroche. Paganini was about to give his\nfirst concert at the Opera. Such was Paris in all its impatience and\nimpertinence, in its confusion and its splendour immediately after the\nRevolution.\n\nThe young wife, who had snapped her bonds asunder, breathed voluptuously\nin this atmosphere. She was like a provincial woman enjoying Paris to\nthe full. She belonged to the romantic school, and was imbued with the\nprinciple that an artist must see everything, know everything, and have\nexperienced himself all that he puts into his books. She found a little\ngroup of her friends from Berry in Paris, among others Felix Pyat,\nCharles Duvernet, Alphonse Fleury, Sandeau and de Latouche. This was\nthe band she frequented, young men apprenticed either to literature,\nthe law, or medicine. With them she lived a student's life. In order to\nfacilitate her various evolutions, she adopted masculine dress. In her\n_Histoite de ma vie_ she says: \"Fashion helped me in my disguise, for\nmen were wearing long, square frock-coats styled a _la proprietaire_.\nThey came down to the heels, and fitted the figure so little that my\nbrother, when putting his on, said to me one day at Nohant: 'It is a\nnice cut, isn't it? The tailor takes his measures from a sentry-box, and\nthe coat then fits a whole regiment.' I had 'a sentry-box coat' made, of\nrough grey cloth, with trousers and waistcoat to match. With a grey\nhat and a huge cravat of woollen material, I looked exactly like a\nfirst-year student. . . .\"\n\nDressed in this style, she explored the streets, museums, cathedrals,\nlibraries, painters' studios, clubs and theatres. She heard Frederick\nLemaitre one day, and the next day Malibran. One evening it was one of\nDumas' pieces, and the next night _Moise_ at the Opera. She took her\nmeals at a little restaurant, and she lived in an attic. She was not\neven sure of being able to pay her tailor, so she had all the joys\npossible. \"Ah, how delightful, to live an artist's life! Our device is\nliberty!\" she wrote.(6) She lived in a perpetual state of delight,\nand, in February, wrote to her son Maurice as follows: \"Every one is at\nloggerheads, we are crushed to death in the streets, the churches are\nbeing destroyed, and we hear the drum being beaten all night.\"(7) In\nMarch she wrote to Charles Duvernet: \"Do you know that fine things are\nhappening here? It really is amusing to see. We are living just as gaily\namong bayonets and riots as if everything were at peace. All this amuses\nme.\"(8)\n\n     (6) _Correspondance_:  To Boucoiran, March 4, 1831.\n\n     (7) _Ibid_. To Maurice Dudevant, February 15, 1831.\n\n     (8) _Ibid_. To Charles Duvernet, March 6, 1831.\n\nShe was amused at everything and she enjoyed everything. With her keen\nsensitiveness, she revelled in the charm of Paris, and she thoroughly\nappreciated its scenery.\n\n\"Paris,\" she wrote, \"with its vaporous evenings, its pink clouds above\nthe roofs, and the beautiful willows of such a delicate green around\nthe bronze statue of our old Henry, and then, too, the dear little\nslate-coloured pigeons that make their nests in the old masks of the\nPont Neuf . . .\"(9)\n\n     (9) Unpublished letters of Dr. Emile Regnault.\n\nShe loved the Paris sky, so strange-looking, so rich in colouring, so\nvariable.(10)\n\n     (10) _Ibid_.\n\nShe became unjust with regard to Berry. \"As for that part of the world\nwhich I used to love so dearly and where I used to dream my dreams,\" she\nwrote, \"I was there at the age of fifteen, when I was very foolish, and\nat the age of seventeen, when I was dreamy and disturbed in my mind. It\nhas lost its charm for me now.\"(11)\n\n     (11) _Ibid_.\n\nShe loved it again later on, certainly, but just at this time she was\nover-excited with the joy of her newly-found liberty. It was that really\nwhich made her so joyful and which intoxicated her. \"I do not want\nsociety, excitement, theatres, or dress; what I want is freedom,\"\nshe wrote to her mother. In another letter she says: \"I am absolutely\nindependent. I go to La Chatre, to Rome. I start out at ten o'clock or\nat midnight. I please myself entirely in all this.\"(12)\n\n     (12) _Correspondance_:  To her mother, May 31, 1831.\n\nShe was free, and she fancied she was happy. Her happiness at that epoch\nmeant Jules Sandeau.\n\nIn a letter, written in the humoristic style in which she delighted, she\ngives us portraits of some of her comrades of that time. She tells us of\nDuvernet, of Alphonse Fleury, surnamed \"the Gaulois,\" and of Sandeau.\n\n\"Oh, fair-haired Charles!\" she writes, \"young man of melancholy\nthoughts, with a character as gloomy as a stormy day. . . . And you,\ngigantic Fleury, with your immense hands and your alarming beard. . . .\nAnd you, dear Sandeau, agreeable and light, like the humming bird of\nfragrant savannahs!\"(13)\n\n     (13) _Correspondance_:  December 1, 1830.\n\nThe \"dear Sandeau, agreeable and light, like the humming bird of\nfragrant savannahs,\" was to be Baronne Dudevant's Latin Quarter\n_liaison_. Her biographers usually pass over this _liaison_ quickly,\nas information about it was not forthcoming. Important documents exist,\nthough, in the form of fifty letters written by George Sand to Dr. Emile\nRegnault, then a medical student and the intimate friend and confidant\nof Jules Sandeau, who kept nothing back from him. His son, Dr. Paul\nRegnault, has kindly allowed me to see this correspondence and to\nreproduce some fragments of it. It is extremely curious, by turn lyrical\nand playful, full of effusions, ideas, plans of work, impressions of\nnature, and confidences about her love affairs. Taken altogether it\nreflects, as nearly as possible, the state of the young woman's mind at\nthis time.\n\nThe first letter is dated April, 1831. George Sand had left Paris for\nNohant, and is anxiously wondering how her poor Jules has passed this\nwretched day, and how he will go back to the room from which she had\ntorn herself with such difficulty that morning. In her letter she gives\nutterance to the gratitude she owes to the young man who has reconciled\nher once more to life. \"My soul,\" she says, \"eager itself for\naffection, needed to inspire this in a heart capable of understanding\nme thoroughly, with all my faults and qualities. A fervent soul was\nnecessary for loving me in the way that I could love, and for consoling\nme after all the ingratitude which had made my earlier life so desolate.\nAnd although I am now old, I have found a heart as young as my own, a\nlifelong affection which nothing can discourage and which grows stronger\nevery day. Jules has taught me to care once more for this existence,\nof which I was so weary, and which I only endured for the sake of my\nchildren. I was disgusted beforehand with the future, but it now seems\nmore beautiful to me, full as it appears to me of him, of his work, his\nsuccess, and of his upright, modest conduct. . . . Oh, if you only knew\nhow I love him! . . . .\"(14)\n\n     (14) This quotation and those that follow are borrowed from\n     the unpublished correspondence with Emile Regnault.\n\n\"When I first knew him I was disillusioned about everything, and I no\nlonger believed in those things which make us happy. He has warmed my\nfrozen heart and restored the life that was dying within me.\" She then\nrecalls their first meeting. It was in the country, at Coudray,\nnear Nohant. She fell in love with her dear Sandeau, thanks to his\nyouthfulness, his timidity and his awkwardness. He was just twenty, in\n1831. On approaching the bench where she was awaiting him, \"he concealed\nhimself in a neighbouring avenue--and I could see his hat and stick\non the bench,\" she writes. \"Everything, even to the little red ribbon\nthreaded in the lining of his grey hat, thrilled me with joy. . . .\"\n\nIt is difficult to say why, but everything connected with this young\nJules seems absurd. Later on we get the following statement: \"Until the\nday when I told him that I loved him, I had never acknowledged as much\nto myself. I felt that I did, but I would not own it even to my own\nheart. Jules therefore learnt it at the same time as I did myself.\"\n\nPeople at La Chatre took the young man for her lover. The idea of\nfinding him again in Paris was probably one of her reasons for wishing\nto establish herself there. Then came her life, as she describes it\nherself, \"in the little room looking on to the quay. I can see Jules\nnow in a shabby, dirty-looking artist's frock-coat, with his cravat\nunderneath him and his shirt open at the throat, stretched out over\nthree chairs, stamping with his feet or breaking the tongs in the heat\nof the discussion. The Gaulois used to sit in a corner weaving great\nplots, and you would be seated on a table.\"\n\nAll this must certainly have been charming. The room was too small,\nthough, and George Sand commissioned Emile Regnault to find her a flat,\nthe essential condition of which should be some way of egress for Jules\nat any hour.\n\nA little flat was discovered on the Quay St. Michel. There were three\nrooms, one of which could be reserved. \"This shall be the dark room,\"\nwrote George Sand, \"the mysterious room, the ghost's retreat, the\nmonster's den, the cage of the performing animal, the hiding-place for\nthe treasure, the vampire's cave, or whatever you like to call\nit. . . .\"\n\nIn plainer language, it was Jules' room; and then follows some touching\neloquence about the dear boy she worshipped who loved her so dearly.\n\nThis is the beginning of things, but later on the tone of the\ncorrespondence changes. The letters become less frequent, and are also\nnot so gay. George Sand speaks much less of Jules in them and much more\nof little Solange, whom she intended to bring back to Paris with her.\nShe is beginning to weary of Jules and to esteem him at his true value.\nHe is lazy, and has fits of depression and all the capriciousness of\na spoilt child. She has had enough of him, and then, too, it is very\nevident from the letters that there has been some division among\nthe lively friends who had sworn to be comrades for life. There are\nexplanations and justifications. George Sand discovers that there are\ncertain inconveniences connected with intimacies in which there is\nsuch disproportion of age and of social position. Finally there are the\nfollowing desperate letters, written in fits of irritation: \"My dear\nfriend, go to Jules and look after him. He is broken-hearted, and you\ncan do nothing for him in that respect. It is no use trying. I do not\nask you to come to me yet, as I do not need anything. I would rather be\nalone to-day. Then, too, there is nothing left for me in life. It will\nbe horrible for him for a long time, but he is so young. The day will\ncome, perhaps, when he will not be sorry to have lived. . . .\nDo not attempt to put matters right, as this time there is no remedy.\nWe do not blame each other at all, and for some time we have been\nstruggling against this horrible necessity. We have had trouble enough.\nThere seemed to be nothing left but to put an end to our lives, and if\nit had not been for my children, we should have done this.\"\n\nThe question is, Was George Sand blameless in the matter? It appears\nthat she had discovered that her dear Jules was faithless to her, and\nthat, during her absence, he had deceived her. She would not forgive\nhim, but sent him off to Italy, and refused to see him again. The last\nof these letters is dated June 15, 1833.\n\n\"I shall make a parcel of a few of Jules' things that he left in\nthe wardrobe,\" she says, \"and I will send them to you. I do not want\nanything to do with him when he comes back, and, according to the last\nwords of the letter you showed me, his return may be soon. For a long\ntime I have been very much hurt by the discoveries I made with regard\nto his conduct, and I could not feel anything else for him now but\naffectionate compassion. His pride, I hope, would refuse this. Make him\nclearly understand, if necessary, that there can never be anything more\nbetween us. If this hard task should not be necessary, that is, if Jules\nshould himself understand that it could not be otherwise, spare him the\nsorrow of hearing that he has lost everything, even my respect. He\nmust undoubtedly have lost his own self-esteem, so that he is punished\nenough.\"\n\nThus ended this great passion. This was the first of George Sand's\nerrors, and it certainly was an immense one. She had imagined that\nhappiness reigns in students' rooms. She had counted on the passing\nfancy of a young man of good family, who had come to Paris to sow his\nwild oats, for giving her fresh zest and for carving out for herself a\nfresh future. It was a most commonplace adventure, utterly destitute of\npsychology, and by its very bitterness it contrasted strangely with\nher elevated sentimental romance with Aurelien de Seze. That was the\nquintessence of refinement. All that is interesting about this second\nadventure is the proof that it gives us of George Sand's wonderful\nillusions, of the intensity of the mirage of which she was a dupe, and\nof which we have so many instances in her life.\n\nBaronne Dudevant had tried conjugal life, and she had now tried free\nlove. She had been unsuccessful in both instances. It is to these\nadventures though, to these trials, errors and disappointments that\nwe owe the writer we are about to study. George Sand was now born to\nliterature.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nA FEMINIST OF 1832\n\nTHE FIRST NOVELS AND THE QUESTION OF MARRIAGE\n\n\nWhen Baronne Dudevant arrived in Paris, in 1831, her intention was to\nearn her living with her pen. She never really counted seriously on the\nincome she might make by her talent for painting flowers on snuff-boxes\nand ornamenting cigar-cases with water-colours. She arrived from her\nprovince with the intention of becoming a writer. Like most authors who\ncommence, she first tried journalism. On the 4th of March, she wrote as\nfollows to the faithful Boucoiran: \"In the meantime I must live, and\nfor the sake of that, I have taken up the worst of trades: I am writing\narticles for the _Figaro_. If only you knew what that means! They are\npaid for, though, at the rate of seven francs a column.\"\n\nShe evidently found it worth while to write for the _Figaro_, which at\nthat time was quite a small newspaper, managed by Henri de Latouche, who\nalso came from Berry. He was a very second-rate writer himself, and\na poet with very little talent but, at any rate, he appreciated\nand discovered talent in others. He published Andre Chenier's first\nwritings, and he introduced George Sand to the public. His new\napprentice was placed at one of the little tables at which the various\nparts of the paper were manufactured. Unfortunately she had not the\nvocation for this work. The first principle with regard to newspaper\narticles is to make them short. When Aurore had come to the end of her\npaper, she had not yet commenced her subject. It was no use attempting\nto continue, so she gave up \"the worst of trades,\" lucrative though it\nmight be.\n\nShe could not help knowing, though, that she had the gift of writing.\nShe had inherited it from her ancestors, and this is the blest part of\nher atavism. No matter how far back we go, and in every branch of her\ngenealogical tree, there is artistic heredity to be found. Maurice de\nSaxe wrote his _Reveries_. This was a fine book for a soldier to write,\nand for that alone he would deserve praise, even if he had not beaten\nthe English so gloriously. Mademoiselle Verrieres was an actress and\nDupin de Francueil a dilettante. Aurore's grandmother, Marie-Aurore, was\nvery musical, she sang operatic songs, and collected extracts from the\nphilosophers. Maurice Dupin was devoted to music and to the theatre.\nEven Sophie-Victoire had an innate appreciation of beauty. She not only\nwept, like Margot, at melodrama, but she noticed the pink of a cloud,\nthe mauve of a flower, and, what was more important, she called her\nlittle daughter's attention to such things. This illiterate mother had\ntherefore had some influence on Aurore and on her taste for literature.\n\nIt is not enough to say that George Sand was a born writer. She was a\nborn novelist, and she belonged to a certain category of novelists.\nShe had been created by a special decree of Providence to write her\nown romances, and not others. It is this which makes the history of\nthe far-back origins of her literary vocation so interesting. It is\nextremely curious to see, from her earliest childhood, the promises of\nthose faculties which were to become the very essence of her talent.\nWhen she was only three years old, her mother used to put her between\nfour chairs in order to keep her still. By way of enlivening her\ncaptivity, she tells us what she did.\n\n\"I used to make up endless stories, which my mother styled my novels.\n. . . I told these stories aloud, and my mother declared that they were\nmost tiresome on account of their length and of the development I gave\nto my digressions. . . . There were very few bad people in them,\nand never any serious troubles. Everything was always arranged\nsatisfactorily, thanks to my lively, optimistic ideas. . . .\"\n\nShe had already commenced, then, at the age of three, and these early\nstories are the precursors of the novels of her maturity. They are\noptimistic, drawn out, and with long digressions. Something similar is\ntold about Walter Scott. There is evidently a primordial instinct in\nthose who are born story-tellers, and this urges them on to invent fine\nstories for amusing themselves.\n\nA little later on we have another phenomenon, almost as curious, with\nregard to Aurore. We are apt to wonder how certain descriptive writers\nproceed in order to give us pictures, the various features of which\nstand out in such intense relief that they appear absolutely real to us.\nGeorge Sand tells us that when Berquin's stories were being read to\nher at Nohant, she used to sit in front of the fire, from which she was\nprotected by an old green silk screen. She used gradually to lose the\nsense of the phrases, but pictures began to form themselves in front of\nher on the green screen.\n\n\"I saw woods, meadows, rivers, towns of strange and gigantic\narchitecture. . . . One day these apparitions were so real that I was\nstartled by them, and I asked my mother whether she could see them.\"\n\n\nWith hallucinations like these a writer can be picturesque. He has\nin front of him, although it may be between four walls, a complete\nlandscape. He has only to follow the lines of it and to reproduce the\ncolours, so that in painting imaginary landscapes he can paint them from\nnature, from this model that appears to him, as though by enchantment.\nHe can, if he likes, count the leaves of the trees and listen to the\nsound of the growing grass.\n\nStill later on, vague religious or philosophical conceptions began\nto mingle with the fiction that Aurore always had in her mind. To her\npoetical life, was added a moral life. She always had a romance going\non, to which she was constantly adding another chapter, like so many\nlinks in a never-ending chain. She now gave a hero to her romance, a\nhero whose name was Corambe. He was her ideal, a man whom she had made\nher god. Whilst blood was flowing freely on the altars of barbarous\ngods, on Corambe's altar life and liberty were given to a whole crowd\nof captive creatures, to a swallow, to a robin-redbreast, and even to a\nsparrow. We see already in all this her tendency to put moral intentions\ninto her romantic stories, to arrange her adventures in such a way that\nthey should serve as examples for making mankind better. These were the\nnovels, with a purpose, of her twelfth year.\n\nLet us now study a striking contrast, by way of observing the first\nsigns of vocation in two totally different novelists. In the beginning\nof _Facino Cane_, Balzac tells us an incident of the time when, as an\naspiring writer, he lived in his attic in the Rue Lesdiguieres. One\nevening, on coming out of the theatre, he amused himself with following\na working-man and his wife from the Boulevard du Pontaux-Choux to the\nBoulevard Beaumarchais. He listened to them as they talked of the piece\nthey had just seen. They then discussed their business matters, and\nafterwards house and family affairs. \"While listening to this couple,\"\nsays Balzac, \"I entered into their life. I could feel their clothes on\nmy back and, I was walking in their shabby boots.\"\n\nThis is the novelist of the objective school, the one who comes out of\nhimself, who ceases to be himself and becomes another person.\n\nInstead of this exterior world, to which Balzac adapts himself, Aurore\ntalks to us of an inner world, emanating from her own fancy, the\nreflection of her own imagination, the echo of her own heart, which is\nreally herself. This explains the difference between Balzac's impersonal\nnovel and George Sand's personal novel. It is just the difference\nbetween realistic art, which gives way to the object, and idealistic\nart, which transforms this according to its own will and pleasure.\n\nUp to this time George Sand's ideas had not been put on to paper. Both\n_Corambe_ and the stories composed between four chairs were merely\nfancies of a child's mind. Aurore soon began to write, though. She had\ncomposed two novels while in the convent, one of which was religious and\nthe other a pastoral story. She was wise enough to tear them both up. On\nleaving the convent she wrote another novel for Rene' de Villeneuve, and\nthis shared the same fate. In 1827, she wrote her _Voyage en Auvergne_,\nand in 1829, another novel. In her _Histoire de ma vie_ she says of\nthis: \"After reading it, I was convinced that it was of no value, but at\nthe same time I was sure I could write a better one. . . . I saw that\nI could write quickly and easily, and without feeling any fatigue.\nThe ideas that were lying dormant in my mind were quickened and became\nconnected, by my deductions, as I wrote. With my meditative life, I had\nobserved a great deal, and had understood the various characters which\nFate had put in my way, so that I really knew enough of human nature\nto be able to depict it.\" She now had that facility, that abundance of\nmatter and that nonchalance which were such characteristic features of\nher writing.\n\nWhen George Sand began to publish, she had already written a great deal.\nHer literary formation was complete. We notice this same thing whenever\nwe study the early work of a writer. Genius is revealed to us, perhaps,\nwith a sudden flash, but it has been making its way for a long time\nunderground, so that what we take for a spontaneous burst of genius is\nnothing but the final effort of a sap which has been slowly accumulating\nand which from henceforth is all-powerful.\n\nGeorge Sand had to go through the inevitable period of feeling her way.\nWe are glad to think that the first book she published was not written\nby herself alone, so that the responsibility of that execrable novel\ndoes not lie solely with her.\n\nOn the 9th of March, 1831, George Sand wrote to Boucoiran as follows:\n\"Monstrosities are in vogue, so we must invent monstrosities. I am\nbringing forth a very pleasant one just at present. . . .\" This was the\nnovel written in collaboration with Sandeau which appeared under the\nsignature of Jules Sand towards the end of 1831. It was entitled, _Rose\net Blanche, ou la Comedienne et la Religieuse_.\n\nIt begins by a scene in a coach, rather like certain novels by Balzac,\nbut accompanied by insignificant details in the worst taste imaginable.\nTwo girls are travelling in the same coach. Rose is a young comedian,\nand Sister Blanche is about to become a nun. They separate at Tarbes,\nand the scene of the story is laid in the region of the Pyrenees, in\nTarbes Auch, Nerac, the Landes, and finishes with the return to Paris.\nRose, after an entertainment which is a veritable orgy, is handed over\nby her mother to a licentious young man. He is ashamed of himself,\nand, instead of leading Rose astray, he takes her to the Convent of the\nAugustines, where she finds Sister Blanche once more. Sister Blanche has\nnot yet pronounced her vows, and the proof of this is that she marries\nHorace. But what a wedding! As a matter of fact, Sister Blanche was\nformerly named Denise. She was the daughter of a seafaring man of\nBordeaux, and was both pretty and foolish. She had been dishonoured by\nthe young libertine whom she is now to marry. The memory of the past\ncomes back to Blanche, and makes her live over again her life as Denise.\nIn the mean time Rose had become a great singer. She now arrives, just\nin time to be present at her friend's deathbed. She enters the convent\nherself, and takes the place left vacant by Sister Blanche. The whole of\nthis is absurd and frequently very disagreeable.\n\nIt is quite easy to distinguish the parts due to the two collaborators,\nand to see that George Sand wrote nearly all the book. There are\nthe landscapes, Tarbes Auch, Nerac, the Landes, and a number of\nrecollections of the famous journey to the Pyrenees and of her stay\nat Guillery with the Dudevant family. The Convent of the Augustines\nin Paris, with its English nuns and its boarders belonging to the best\nfamilies, is the one in which Aurore spent three years. The cloister can\nbe recognized, the garden planted with chestnut trees, and the cell\nfrom which there was a view over the city. All her dreams seemed so near\nHeaven there, for the rich, cloudy sky was so near--\"that most beautiful\nand ever-changing sky, perhaps the most beautiful in the world,\" of\nwhich we read in _Rose et Blanche_. But together with this romance of\nreligious life is a libertine novel with stories of orgies, of a certain\nprivate house, and of very risky and unpleasant episodes. This is the\ncollaborator's share in the work. The risky parts are Sandeau's.\n\nSuch, then, is this hybrid composition. It was, in reality, the\nmonstrosity announced by George Sand.\n\nIt had a certain success, but the person who was most severe in her\njudgment of it was Sophie-Victoire, George Sand's mother, who had very\nprudish tastes in literature. This woman is perfectly delightful,\nand every time we come across her it is a fresh joy. Her daughter was\nobliged to make some excuse for herself, and this she did by stating\nthat the work was not entirely her own.\n\n\"I do not approve of a great deal of the nonsense,\" she writes, \"and\nI only let certain things pass to please my publisher, who wanted\nsomething rather lively. . . . I do not like the risky parts\nmyself. . . .\" Later on in the same letter, she adds: \"There is nothing\nof the kind in the book I am writing now, and I am using nothing of my\ncollaborator's in this, except his name.\"(15)\n\n     (15) _Correspondance_:  To her mother, February 22, 1832.\n\nThis was true. Jules Sand had had his day, and the book of which she now\nspeaks was _Indiana_. She signed this \"George Sand.\"\n\nThe unpublished correspondence with Emile Regnault, some fragments of\nwhich we have just read, contains a most interesting letter concerning\nthe composition of _Indiana_. It is dated February 28, 1832. George Sand\nfirst insists on the severity of the subject and on its resemblance to\nlife. \"It is as simple, as natural and as positive as you could wish,\"\nshe says. \"It is neither romantic, mosaic, nor frantic. It is just\nordinary life of the most _bourgeois_ kind, but unfortunately this is\nmuch more difficult than exaggerated literature. . . . There is not the\nleast word put in for nothing, not a single description, not a\nvestige of poetry. There are no unexpected, extraordinary, or amazing\nsituations, but merely four volumes on four characters. With only just\nthese characters, that is, with hidden feelings, everyday thoughts,\nwith friendship, love, selfishness, devotion, self-respect, persistency,\nmelancholy, sorrow, ingratitude, disappointment, hope, and all the\nmixed-up medley of the human mind, is it possible to write four volumes\nwhich will not bore people? I am afraid of boring people, of boring them\nas life itself does. And yet what is more interesting than the history\nof the heart, when it is a true history? The main thing is to write true\nhistory, and it is just that which is so difficult. . . .\"\n\nThis declaration is rather surprising to any one who reads it to-day.\nWe might ask whether what was natural in 1832 would be natural in 1910?\nThat is not the question which concerns us, though. The important fact\nto note is that George Sand was no longer attempting to manufacture\nmonstrosities. She was endeavouring to be true, and she wanted above\neverything else to present a character of woman who would be the typical\nmodern woman.\n\n\"Noemi (this name was afterwards left to Sandeau, who had used it in\n_Marianna_. George Sand changed it to that of _Indiana_) is a typical\nwoman, strong and weak, tired even by the weight of the air, but capable\nof holding up the sky; timid in everyday life, but daring in days of\nbattle; shrewd and clever in seizing the loose threads of ordinary life,\nbut silly and stupid in distinguishing her own interests when it is a\nquestion of her happiness; caring little for the world at large, but\nallowing herself to be duped by one man; not troubling much about\nher own dignity, but watching over that of the object of her choice;\ndespising the vanities of the times as far as she is concerned, but\nallowing herself to be fascinated by the man who is full of these\nvanities. This, I believe,\" she says, \"is the usual woman, an\nextraordinary mixture of weakness and energy, of grandeur and of\nlittleness, a being ever composed of two opposite natures, at times\nsublime and at times despicable, clever in deceiving and easily deceived\nherself.\"\n\nThis novel, intended to present to us the modern woman, ought to be\nstyled a \"feminist novel.\" It was also, as regards other points of view.\n_Indiana_ appeared in May, 1832, _Valentine_ in 1833, and _Jacques_ in\n1834. In these three books I should like to show our present feminism,\nalready armed, and introduced to us according to George Sand's early\nideas.\n\n\n_Indiana_ is the story of a woman who had made an unfortunate marriage.\nAt the age of nineteen she had married Colonel Delmare. Colonels were\nvery much in vogue in those days, and the fact that he had attained that\nrank proves that he was much older than she was. Colonel Delmare was an\nhonest, straightforward man in the Pharisaical sense of the word. This\nsimply means that he had never robbed or killed any one. He had no\ndelicacy and no charm, and, fond as he was of his own authority, he\nwas a domestic tyrant. Indiana was very unhappy between this execrable\nhusband and a cousin of hers, Ralph, a man who is twice over English,\nin the first place because his name is Brown, and then because he is\nphlegmatic. Ralph is delightful and most excellent, and it is on his\naccount that she is insensible to the charms of Raymon de Ramieres an\nelegant and distinguished young man who is a veritable lady-killer.\n\nSpace forbids us to go into all the episodes of this story, but the\ncrisis is that Colonel Delmare is ruined, and his business affairs call\nhim to the Isle of Bourbon. He intends to take Indiana with him, but she\nrefuses to accompany him. She knows quite well that Raymon will do all\nhe can to prevent her going. She hurries away to him, offers herself to\nhim, and volunteers to remain with him always. It is unnecessary to give\nRaymon's reply to this charming proposal. Poor Indiana receives a very\nwet blanket on a cold winter's night.\n\n\nShe therefore starts for the Isle of Bourbon, and, some time after her\narrival there, she gets a letter from Raymon which makes her think that\nhe is very unhappy. She accordingly hastens back to him, but is received\nby the young wife whom Raymon has just married. It is a very\nbrilliant marriage, and Raymon could not have hoped for anything more\nsatisfactory. Poor Indiana! The Seine, however, is quite near, and she\nthrows herself into it. This was quite safe, as Ralph was there to\nfish her out again. Ralph was always at hand to fish his cousin out of\neverything. He is her appointed rescuer, her Newfoundland dog. In the\ncountry or in the town, on _terra firma_ or on the boat which takes\nIndiana to the Isle of Bourbon, we always see Ralph turn up, phlegmatic\nas usual. Unnecessary to say that Ralph is in love with Indiana. His\napparent calmness is put on purposely. It is the snowy covering under\nwhich a volcano is burning. His awkward and unprepossessing appearance\nconceals an exquisite soul. Ralph brings Indiana good news. Colonel\nDelmare is dead, so that she is free. What will she do now with her\nliberty? After due deliberation, Ralph and Indiana decide to commit\nsuicide, but they have to agree about the kind of death they will die.\nRalph considers that this is a matter of certain importance. He does not\ncare to kill himself in Paris; there are too many people about, so that\nthere is no tranquillity. The Isle of Bourbon seems to him a pleasant\nplace for a suicide. There was a magnificent horizon there; then, too,\nthere was a precipice and a waterfall. . . .\n\nRalph's happy ideas are somewhat sinister, but the couple set out\nnevertheless for the Isle of Bourbon in search of a propitious\nwaterfall. A sea-voyage, under such circumstances, would be an excellent\npreparation. When once there, they carry out their plans, and Ralph\ngives his beloved wise advice at the last moment. She must not jump from\nthe side, as that would be bad. \"Throw yourself into the white line that\nthe waterfall makes,\" he says. \"You will then reach the lake with that,\nand the torrent will plunge you in.\" This sounds enticing.\n\nSuch a suicide was considered infinitely poetical at that epoch, and\nevery one pitied Indiana in her troubles. It is curious to read such\nbooks calmly a long time afterwards, books which reflect so exactly the\nsentiments of a certain epoch. It is curious to note how the point of\nview has changed, and how people and things appear to us exactly the\nreverse of what they appeared to the author and to contemporaries.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the only interesting person in all this is Colonel\nDelmare, or, at any rate, he is the only one of whom Indiana could\nnot complain. He loved her, and he loved no one else but her. The like\ncannot be said for Indiana. Few husbands would imitate his patience and\nforbearance, and he certainly allowed his wife the most extraordinary\nfreedom. At one time we find, a young man in Indiana's bedroom, and at\nanother time Indiana in a young man's bedroom. Colonel Delmare receives\nRaymon at his house in a friendly way, and he tolerates the presence of\nthe sempiternal Ralph in his home. What more can be asked of a husband\nthan to allow his wife to have a man friend and a cousin? Indiana\ndeclares that Colonel Delmare has struck her, and that the mark is left\non her face. She exaggerated, though, as we know quite well what took\nplace. In reality all this was at Plessis-Picard. Delmare-Dudevant\nstruck Indiana-Aurore. This was certainly too much, but there was no\nblood shed. As to the other personages, Raymon is a wretched little\nrascal, who was first the lover of Indiana's maid. He next made love\nto poor Noun's mistress, and then deserted her to make a rich marriage.\nRalph plunges Indiana down a precipice. That was certainly bad treatment\nfor the woman he loved. As regards Indiana, George Sand honestly\nbelieved that she had given her all the charms imaginable. As a matter\nof fact, she did charm the readers of that time. It is from this model\nthat we have one of the favourite types of woman in literature for the\nnext twenty years--the misunderstood woman.\n\nThe misunderstood woman is pale, fragile, and subject to fainting. Up to\npage 99 of the book, Indiana has fainted three times. I did not continue\ncounting. This fainting was not the result of bad health. It was the\nfashion to faint. The days of nerves and languid airs had come back. The\nwomen whose grandmothers had walked so firmly to the scaffold, and\nwhose mothers had listened bravely to the firing of the cannon under the\nEmpire, were now depressed and tearful, like so many plaintive elegies.\nIt was just a matter of fashion. The misunderstood woman was supposed\nto be unhappy with her husband, but she would not have been any happier\nwith another man. Indiana does not find fault with Colonel Delmare for\nbeing the husband that he is, but simply for being the husband!\n\n\"She did not love her husband, for the mere reason, perhaps, that she\nwas told it was her duty to love him and that it had become her second\nnature, a principle and a law of her conscience to resist inwardly\nall moral constraint.\" She affected a most irritating gentleness, an\nexasperating submissiveness. When she put on her superior, resigned\nairs, it was enough to unhinge an angel. Besides, what was there to\ncomplain about, and why should she not accommodate herself to conditions\nof existence with which so many others fall in? She must not be compared\nto others, though. She is eminently a distinguished woman, and she asks\nwithout shrinking: \"Do you know what it means to love a woman such as I\nam?\"\n\nIn her long silences and her persistent melancholy, she is no doubt\nthinking of the love appropriate to a woman such as she is. She was a\nprincess in exile and times were then hard for princesses. That is why\nthe one in question took refuge in her homesick sorrow. All this is what\npeople will not understand. Instead of rising to such sublimities, or of\nbeing lost in fogs, they judge from mere facts. And on coming across\na young wife who is inclined to prefer a handsome, dark young man to a\nhusband who is turning grey, they are apt to conclude: \"Well, this is\nnot the first time we have met with a similar case. It is hardly worth\nwhile making such a fuss about a young plague of a woman who wants to\ngo to the bad.\" It would be very unjust, though, not to recognize that\n_Indiana_ is a most remarkable novel. There is a certain relief in the\nvarious characters, Colonel Delmare, Raymon, Ralph and Inaiana. We ought\nto question the husbands who married wives belonging to the race of\nmisunderstood women brought into vogue by _Indiana_.\n\n\n_Valentine_, too, is the story of a woman unhappily married.\n\nThis time the chief _role_ is given to the lover, and not to the woman.\nInstead of the misunderstood woman, though, we have the typical frenzied\nlover, created by the romantic school. Louise-Valentine de Raimbault\nis about to marry Norbert-Evariste de Lansac, when suddenly this young\nperson, who is accustomed to going about in the country round and to the\nvillage fetes, falls in love with the nephew of one of her farmers.\nThe young man's name is Benedict, and he is a peasant who has had some\neducation. His mentality is probably that of a present-day elementary\nschool-teacher. Valentine cannot resist him, although we are told that\nBenedict is not very handsome. It is his soul which Valentine loves in\nhim. Benedict knows very well that he cannot marry Valentine, but he can\ncause her a great deal of annoyance by way of proving his love. On the\nnight of the wedding he is in the nuptial chamber, from which the\nauthor has taken care to banish the husband for the time being. Benedict\nwatches over the slumber of the woman he loves, and leaves her an\nepistle in which he declares that, after hesitating whether he should\nkill her husband, her, or himself, or whether he should kill all three,\nor only select two of the three, and after adopting in turn each of\nthese combinations, he has decided to only kill himself. He is found\nin a ditch in a terrible plight, but we are by no means rid of him.\nBenedict is not dead, and he has a great deal of harm to do yet. We\nshall meet with him again several times, always hidden behind curtains,\nlistening to all that is said and watching all that takes place. At the\nright moment he comes out with his pistol in his hand. The husband is\naway during all this time. No one troubles about him, though. He is a\nbad husband, or rather he is--a husband, and Benedict has nothing to\nfear as far as he is concerned. But one day a peasant, who does not like\nthe looks of Benedict, attacks him with his pitchfork and puts an end to\nthis valuable life.\n\nThe question arises, by what right Benedict disturbs Valentine's\ntranquillity. The answer is by the right of his passion for her. He has\nan income of about twenty pounds a year. It would be impossible for him\nto marry on that. What has he to offer to the woman whose peace of mind\nhe disturbs and whose position he ruins? He offers himself. Surely that\nshould be enough. Then, too, it is impossible to reason with individuals\nof his temperament. We have only to look at him, with his sickly pallor\nand the restless light in his eyes. We have only to listen to the sound\nof his voice and his excited speeches. At times he goes in for wild\ndeclamation, and immediately afterwards for cold irony and sarcasm. He\nis always talking of death. When he attempts to shoot himself he always\nmisses, but when Adele d'Hervey resists him, at the time he has taken\nthe name of Antony, he kills her. He is therefore a dangerous madman.\n\nWe now have two fresh personages for novels, the misunderstood woman and\nthe frenzied lover. It is a pity they do not marry each other, and so\nrid us of them.\n\nWe must not lose sight, though, of the fact that, contestable as\n_Valentine_ certainly is as a novel of passion, there is a pastoral\nnovel of the highest order contained in this book. The setting of the\nstory is delightful. George Sand has placed the scene in that Black\nValley which she knew so well and loved so dearly. It is the first of\nher novels in which she celebrates her birthplace. There are walks along\nthe country pathways, long meditations at night, village weddings\nand fetes. All the poetry and all the picturesqueness of the country\ntransform and embellish the story.\n\n\nIn _Jacques_ we have the history of a man unhappily married, and this,\nthrough the reciprocity which is inevitable under the circumstances, is\nanother story of a woman unhappily married.\n\nAt the age of thirty-five, after a stormy existence, in which years\ncount double, Jacques marries Fernande, a woman much younger than he\nis. After a few unhappy months he sees the first clouds appearing in his\nhorizon. He sends for his sister Sylvia to come and live with himself\nand his wife. Sylvia, like Jacques, is an exceptional individual. She\nis proud, haughty and reserved. It can readily be imagined that, the\npresence of this pythoness does not tend to restore the confidence which\nhas become somewhat shaken between the husband and wife. A young man\nnamed Octave, who was at first attracted by Sylvia, soon begins to\nprefer Fernande, who is not a romantic, ironical and sarcastic woman\nlike her sister-in-law. He fancies that he should be very happy with the\ngentle Fernande. Jacques discovers that Octave and his wife are in love\nwith each other. There are various alternatives for him. He can dismiss\nhis rival, kill him, or merely pardon him. Each alternative is a very\nordinary way out of the difficulty, and Jacques cannot resign himself to\nanything ordinary. He therefore asks his wife's lover whether he really\ncares for his wife, whether he is in earnest, and also whether this\nattachment will be durable. Quite satisfied with the result of this\nexamination, he leaves Fernande to Octave. He then disappears and kills\nhimself, but he takes all necessary precautions to avert the suspicion\nof suicide, in order not to sadden Octave and Fernande in their\nhappiness. He had not been able to keep his wife's love, but he does not\nwish to be the jailer of the woman who no longer loves him. Fernande\nhas a right to happiness and, as he has not been able to ensure that\nhappiness, he must give place to another man. It is a case of suicide\nas a duty. There are instances when a husband should know that it is his\nduty to disappear. . . . Jacques is \"a stoic.\" George Sand has a great\nadmiration for such characters. She gives us her first sketch of one in\nRalph, but Jacques is presented to us as a sublime being.\n\nPersonally, I look upon him as a mere greenhorn, or, as would be said in\nWagner's dramas, a \"pure simpleton.\"\n\nHe did everything to ruin his home life. His young wife had confidence\nin him; she was gay and naive. He went about, folding his arms in a\ntragic way. He was absent-minded and gloomy, and she began to be awed by\nhim. One day, when, in her sorrow for having displeased him, she flung\nherself on her knees, sobbing, instead of lifting her up tenderly, he\nbroke away from her caresses, telling her furiously to get up and never\nto behave in such a way again in his presence. After this he puts his\nsister, the \"bronze woman,\" between them, and he invites Octave to live\nwith them. When he has thus destroyed his wife's affection for him, in\nspite of the fact that at one time she wished for nothing better than\nto love him, he goes away and gives up the whole thing. All that is too\neasy. One of Meilhac's heroines says to a man, who declares that he is\ngoing to drown himself for her sake, \"Oh yes, that is all very fine. You\nwould be tranquil at the bottom of the water! But what about me? . . .\"\n\nIn this instance Jacques is tranquil at the bottom of his precipice, but\nFernande is alive and not at all tranquil. Jacques never rises to the\nvery simple conception of his duty, which was that, having made a woman\nthe companion of his life's journey, he had no right to desert her on\nthe way.\n\nRather than blame himself, though, Jacques prefers incriminating the\ninstitution of marriage. The criticism of this institution is very\nplain in the novel we are considering. In her former novels George, Sand\ntreated all this in a more or less vague way. She now states her theory\nclearly. Jacques considers that marriage is a barbarous institution.\n\"I have not changed my opinion,\" he says, \"and I am not reconciled to\nsociety. I consider marriage one of the most barbarous institutions\never invented. I have no doubt that it will be abolished when the human\nspecies makes progress in the direction of justice and reason. Some\nbond that will be more human and just as sacred will take the place of\nmarriage and provide for the children born of a woman and a man, without\nfettering their liberty for ever. Men are too coarse at present, and\nwomen too cowardly, to ask for a nobler law than the iron one which\ngoverns them. For individuals without conscience and without virtue,\nheavy chains are necessary.\"\n\nWe also hear Sylvia's ideas and the plans she proposes to her brother\nfor the time when marriage is abolished.\n\n\"We will adopt an orphan, imagine that it is our child, and bring it up\nin our principles. We could educate a child of each sex, and then marry\nthem when the time came, before God, with no other temple than the\ndesert and no priest but love. We should have formed their souls to\nrespect truth and justice, so that, thanks to us, there would be one\npure and happy couple on the face of the earth.\"\n\nThe suppression of marriage, then, was the idea, and, in a future more\nor less distant, free love!\n\nIt is interesting to discover by what series of deductions George Sand\nproceeds and on what principles she bases everything. When once her\nprinciples are admitted, the conclusion she draws from them is quite\nlogical.\n\nWhat is her essential objection to marriage? The fact that marriage\nfetters the liberty of two beings. \"Society dictates to you the formula\nof an oath. You must swear that you will be faithful and obedient to me,\nthat you will never love any one but me, and that you will obey me in\neverything. One of those oaths is absurd and the other vile. You cannot\nbe answerable for your heart, even if I were the greatest and most\nperfect of men.\" Now comes the question of love for another man. Until\nthen it was considered that such love was a weakness, and that it might\nbecome a fault. But, after all, is not passion a fatal and irresistible\nthing?\n\n\"No human creature can command love, and no one is to be blamed for\nfeeling it or for ceasing to feel it. What lowers a woman is untruth.\" A\nlittle farther on we are told: \"They are not guilty, for they love each\nother. There is no crime where there is sincere love.\" According to\nthis theory, the union of man and woman depends on love alone. When love\ndisappears, the union cannot continue. Marriage is a human institution,\nbut passion is of Divine essence. In case of any dissension, it is\nalways the institution of marriage which is to be blamed.\n\nThe sole end in view of marriage is charm, either that of sentiment or\nthat of the senses, and its sole object is the exchange of two fancies.\nAs the oath of fidelity is either a stupidity or a degradation, can\nanything more opposed to common sense, and a more absolute ignorance\nof all that is noble and great, be imagined than the effort mankind\nis making, against all the chances of destruction by which he is\nsurrounded, to affirm, in face of all that changes, his will and\nintention to continue? We all remember the heart-rending lamentation of\nDiderot: \"The first promises made between two creatures of flesh,\" he\nsays, \"were made at the foot of a rock crumbling to dust. They called on\nHeaven to be a witness of their constancy, but the skies in the Heaven\nabove them were never the same for an instant. Everything was changing,\nboth within them and around them, and they believed that their heart\nwould know no change. Oh, what children, what children always!\" Ah,\nnot children, but what men rather! We know these fluctuations in our\naffections. And it is because we are afraid of our own fragility that\nwe call to our aid the protection of laws, to which submission is no\nslavery, as it is voluntary submission. Nature does not know these laws,\nbut it is by them that we distinguish ourselves from Nature and that\nwe rise above it. The rock on which we tread crumbles to dust, the sky\nabove our heads is never the same an instant, but, in the depth of our\nhearts, there is the moral law--and that never changes!\n\nIn order to reply to these paradoxes, where shall we go in search of our\narguments? We can go to George Sand herself. A few years later, during\nher intercourse with Lamennals, she wrote her famous _Lettres a Marcie_\nfor _Le Monde_. She addresses herself to an imaginary correspondent,\nto a woman supposed to be suffering from that agitation and impatience\nwhich she had experienced herself.\n\n\"You are sad,\" says George Sand to her, \"you are suffering, and you are\nbored to death.\" We will now take note of some of the advice she gives\nto this woman. She no longer believes that it belongs to human dignity\nto have the liberty of changing. \"The one thing to which man aspires,\nthe thing which makes him great, is permanence in the moral state. All\nwhich tends to give stability to our desires, to strengthen the human\nwill and affections, tends to bring about the _reign of God_ on earth,\nwhich means love and the practice of truth.\" She then speaks of vain\ndreams. \"Should we even have time to think about the impossible if we\ndid all that is necessary? Should we despair ourselves if we were to\nrestore hope in those people who have nothing left them but hope?\" With\nregard to feminist claims, she says: \"Women are crying out that they are\nslaves: let them wait until men are free! . . . In the mean time we must\nnot compromise the future by our impatience with the present. . . . It\nis to be feared that vain attempts of this kind and unjustifiable claims\nmay do harm to what is styled at present the cause of women. There is\nno doubt that women have certain rights and that they are suffering\ninjustice. They ought to lay claim to a better future, to a wise\nindependence, to a greater participation in knowledge, and to more\nrespect, interest and esteem from men. This future, though, is in their\nown hands.\"\n\nThis is wisdom itself. It would be impossible to put it more clearly,\nand to warn women in a better way, that the greatest danger for\ntheir cause would be the triumph of what is called by an ironical\nterm--feminism.\n\nThese retractions, though, have very little effect. There is a certain\npiquancy in showing up an author who is in contradiction with himself,\nin showing how he refutes his own paradoxes. But these are striking\nparadoxes which are not readily forgotten. What I want to show is that\nin these first novels by George Sand we have about the whole of\nthe feminist programme of to-day. Everything is there, the right to\nhappiness, the necessity of reforming marriage, the institution, in\na more or less near future, of free unions. Our feminists of to-day,\nFrench, English, or Norwegian authoresses, and theoricians like Ellen\nKey, with her book on _Love and Marriage_, all these rebels have\ninvented nothing. They have done nothing but take up once more the\ntheories of the great feminist of 1832, and expose them with less\nlyricism but with more cynicism.\n\nGeorge Sand protested against the accusation of having aimed at\nattacking institutions in her feminist novels. She was wrong in\nprotesting, as it is just this which gives her novels their value\nand significance. It is this which dates them and which explains the\nenormous force of expansion that they have had. They came just after\nthe July Revolution, and we must certainly consider them as one of\nthe results of that. A throne had just been overturned, and, by way of\npastime, churches were being pillaged and an archbishop's palace had\nbeen sackaged. Literature was also attempting an insurrection, by way of\ndiversion. For a long time it had been feeding the revolutionary ferment\nwhich it had received from romanticism. Romanticism had demanded the\nfreedom of the individual, and the writers at the head of this movement\nwere Chateaubriand, Victor Hugo and Dumas. They claimed this freedom\nfor Rene, for Hermann and for Antony, who were men. An example had been\ngiven, and women meant to take advantage of it. Women now began their\nrevolution.\n\nUnder all these influences, and in the particular atmosphere now\ncreated, the matrimonial mishap of Baronne Dudevant appeared to her\nof considerable importance. She exaggerated and magnified it until it\nbecame of social value. Taking this private mishap as her basis, she\nputs into each of her heroines something of herself. This explains the\npassionate tone of the whole story. And this passion could not fail to\nbe contagious for the women who read her stories, and who recognized in\nthe novelist's cause their own cause and the cause of all women.\n\nThis, then, is the novelty in George Sand's way of presenting feminist\ngrievances. She had not invented these grievances. They were already\ncontained in Madame de Stael's books, and I have not forgotten her.\nDelphine and Corinne, though, were women of genius, and presented to\nus as such. In order to be pitied by Madame de Stael, it was absolutely\nnecessary to be a woman of genius. For a woman to be defended by George\nSand, it was only necessary that she should not love her husband, and\nthis was a much more general thing.\n\n\nGeorge Sand had brought feminism within the reach of all women. This\nis the characteristic of these novels, the eloquence of which cannot be\ndenied. They are novels for the vulgarization of the feminist theory.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nTHE ROMANTIC ESCAPADE\n\nTHE VENICE ADVENTURE\n\n\nGeorge Sand did not have to wait long for success. She won fame with her\nfirst book. With her second one she became rich, or what she considered\nrich. She tells us that she sold it for a hundred and sixty pounds! That\nseemed to her the wealth of the world, and she did not hesitate to leave\nher attic on the Quay St. Michel for a more comfortable flat on Quay\nMalaquais, which de Latouche gave up to her.\n\nThere was, at that time, a personage in Paris who had begun to exercise\na sort of royal tyranny over authors. Francois Buloz had taken advantage\nof the intellectual effervescence of 1831 to found the _Revue des Deux\nMondes_. He was venturesome, energetic, original, very shrewd, though\napparently rough, obliging, in spite of his surly manners. He is still\nconsidered the typical and traditional review manager. He certainly\npossessed the first quality necessary for this function. He discovered\ntalented writers, and he also knew how to draw from them and squeeze out\nof them all the literature they contained. Tremendously headstrong,\nhe has been known to keep a contributor under lock and key until his\narticle was finished. Authors abused him, quarrelled with him, and\nthen came back to him again. A review which had, for its first numbers,\nGeorge Sand, Vigny, Musset, Merimee, among many others, as contributors,\nmay be said to have started well. George Sand tells us that after a\nbattle with the _Revue de Paris_ and the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, both\nof which papers wanted her work, she bound herself to the _Revue des\nDeux Mondes_, which was to pay her a hundred and sixty pounds a year for\nthirty-two pages of writing every six weeks. In 1833 the _Revue des Deux\nMondes_ published Lelia, and on January 1, 1876, it finished publishing\nthe _Tour de Percemont_. This means an uninterrupted collaboration,\nextending over a period of forty-three years.\n\nThe literary critic of the _Revue des Deux Mondes_ at that time was\na man who was very much respected and very little liked, or, in other\nwords, he was universally detested. This critic was Gustave Planche.\nHe took his own _role_ too seriously, and endeavoured to put authors\non their guard about their faults. Authors did not appreciate this.\nHe endeavoured, too, to put the public on guard against its own\ninfatuations. The public did not care for this. He sowed strife and\nreaped revenge. This did not stop him, though, for he went calmly on\ncontinuing his executions. His impassibility was only feigned, and this\nis the curious side of the story. He suffered keenly from the storms of\nhostility which he provoked. He had a kindly disposition at bottom\nand tender places in his heart. He was rather given to melancholy and\nintensely pessimistic. To relieve his sadness, he gave himself up to\nhard work, and he was thoroughly devoted to art. In order to comprehend\nthis portrait and to see its resemblance, we, who knew our great\nBrunetiere, have only to think of him. He, too, was noble, fervent\nand combative, and he sought in his exclusive devotion to literature a\ndiversion from his gloomy pessimism, underneath which was concealed such\nkindliness. It seemed with him, too, as though he took a pride in making\na whole crowd of enemies, whilst in reality the discovery of every fresh\nadversary caused him great suffering.\n\nWhen _Lelia_ appeared, the novel was very badly treated in _L'Europe\nlitteraire_. Planche challenged the writer of the article, a certain\nCapo de Feuillide, to a duel. So much for the impassibility of\nsevere critics. The duel took place, and afterwards there was a\nmisunderstanding between George Sand and Planche. From that time forth\ncritics have given up fighting duels for the sake of authors.\n\nAbout the same time, George Sand made use of Sainte-Beuve as her\nconfessor. He seemed specially indicated for this function. In the first\nplace, he looked rather ecclesiastical, and then he had a taste for\nsecrets, and more particularly for whispered confessions. George Sand\nhad absolute confidence in him. She considered that he had an almost\nangelic nature. In reality, just about that time, the angelic man was\nendeavouring to get into the good graces of the wife of his best friend,\nand was writing his _Livre d'Amour_, and divulging to the world a\nweakness of which he had taken advantage. This certainly was the most\nvillainous thing a man could do. But then he, too, was in love and was\nstruggling and praying. George Sand declares her veneration for him, and\nshe constituted herself his penitent.\n\nShe begins her confession by an avowal that must have been difficult for\nher. She tells of her intimacy with Merimee, an intimacy which was\nof short duration and very unsatisfactory. She had been fascinated by\nMerimee's art.\n\n\"For about a week,\" she says, \"I thought he had the secret of\nhappiness.\" At the end of the week she was \"weeping with disgust,\nsuffering and discouragement.\" She had hoped to find in him the devotion\nof a consoler, but she found \"nothing but cold and bitter jesting.\"(16)\nThis experiment had also proved a failure.\n\n     (16) Compare _Lettres a Sainte-Beuve_.\n\nSuch were the conditions in which George Sand found herself at this\nepoch. Her position was satisfactory; she might have been calm and\nindependent. Her inner life was once more desolate, and she was\nthoroughly discouraged. She felt that she had lived centuries, that she\nhad undergone torture, that her heart had aged twenty years, and that\nnothing was any pleasure to her now. Added to all this, public life\nsaddened her, for the horizon had clouded over. The boundless hopes and\nthe enthusiasm of 1831 were things of the past. \"The Republic, as it was\ndreamed of in July,\" she writes, \"has ended in the massacres of Warsaw\nand in the holocaust of the Saint-Merry cloister. The cholera has just\nbeen raging. Saint Simonism has fallen through before it had settled the\ngreat question of love.\"(17)\n\n     (17) _Histoire de ma vie_.\n\nDepression had come after over-excitement. This is a phenomenon\nfrequently seen immediately after political convulsions. It might be\ncalled the perpetual failure of revolutionary promises.\n\nIt was under all these influences that George Sand wrote _Lelia_. She\nfinished it in July, and it appeared in August, 1833.\n\nIt is absolutely impossible to give an analysis of _Lelia_. There really\nis no subject. The personages are not beings of flesh and blood. They\nare allegories strolling about in the garden of abstractions. Lelia is\na woman who has had her trials in life. She has loved and been\ndisappointed, so that she can no longer love at all. She reduces the\ngentle poet Stenio to despair. He is much younger than she is, and he\nhas faith in life and in love. His ingenuous soul begins to wither\nand to lose its freshness, thanks to the scepticism of the beautiful,\ndisdainful, ironical and world-weary Lelia. This strange person has a\nsister Pulcherie, a celebrated courtesan, whose insolent sensuality is\na set-off to the other one's mournful complaints. We have here the\nopposition of Intelligence and of the Flesh, of Mind and Matter. Then\ncomes Magnus, the priest, who has lost his faith, and for whom Lelia\nis a temptation, and after him we have Trenmor, Lelia's great friend,\nTrenmor, the sublime convict. As a young man he had been handsome. He\nhad loved and been young. He had known what it was to be only twenty\nyears of age. \"The only thing was, he had known this at the age\nof sixteen\" (!!) He had then become a gambler, and here follows an\nextraordinary panegyric on the fatal passion for gambling. Trenmor\nruins himself, borrows without paying back, and finally swindles \"an old\nmillionaire who was himself a defrauder and a dissipated man\" out of\na hundred francs. Apparently the bad conduct of the man Trenmor robs,\nexcuses the swindling. He is condemned to five years of hard labour. He\nundergoes his punishment, and is thereby regenerated. \"What if I were to\ntell you,\" writes George Sand, \"that such as he now is, crushed, with a\ntarnished reputation, ruined, I consider him superior to all of us, as\nregards the moral life. As he had deserved punishment, he was willing to\nbear it. He bore it, living for five years bravely and patiently among\nhis abject companions. He has come back to us out of that abominable\nsewer holding his head up, calm, purified, pale as you see him, but\nhandsome still, like a creature sent by God.\"\n\nWe all know how dear convicts are to the hearts of romantic people.\nThere is no need for me to remind you how they have come to us recently,\nencircled with halos of suffering and of purity. We all remember\nDostoiewsky's _Crime and Punishment_ and Tolstoi's _Resurrection_. When\nthe virtue of expiation and the religion of human suffering came to\nus from Russia, we should have greeted them as old acquaintances, if\ncertain essential works in our own literature, of which these books are\nthe issue, had not been unknown to us.\n\nThe last part of the novel is devoted to Stenio. Hurt by Lelia's\ndisdain, which has thrown him into the arms of her sister Pulcherie,\nhe gives himself up to debauch. We find him at a veritable orgy in\nPulcherie's house. Later on he is in a monastery at Camaldules, talking\nto Trenmor and Magnus. In such books we must never be astonished. . . .\nThere is a long speech by Stenio, addressed to Don Juan, whom he\nregrets to have taken as his model. The poor young man of course commits\nsuicide. He chooses drowning as the author evidently prefers that mode\nof suicide. Lelia arrives in time to kneel down by the corpse of the\nyoung man who has been her victim. Magnus then appears on the scene,\nexactly at the right moment, to strangle Lelia. Pious hands prepare\nLelia and Stenio for their burial. They are united and yet separated up\nto their very death.\n\nThe summing up we have given is the original version of _Lelia_.\nIn 1836, George Sand touched up this work, altering much of it and\nspoiling, what she altered. It is a pity that her new version, which\nis longer, heavier and more obscure, should have taken the place of the\nformer one. In its first form _Lelia_ is a work of rare beauty, but with\nthe beauty of a poem or an oratorio. It is made of the stuff of which\ndreams are composed. It is a series of reveries, adapted to the soul\nof 1830. At every different epoch there is a certain frame of mind, and\ncertain ideas are diffused in the air which we find alike in the works\nof the writers of that time, although they did not borrow them from each\nother. _Lelia_ is a sort of summing up of the themes then in vogue in\nthe personal novel and in lyrical poetry. The theme of that suffering\nwhich is beneficent and inspiring is contained in the following words:\n\"Come back to me, Sorrow! Why have you left me? It is by grief alone\nthat man is great.\" This is worthy of Chateaubriand. The theme of\nmelancholy is as follows: \"The moon appeared. . . . What is the moon,\nand what is its nocturnal magic to me? One hour more or less is nothing\nto me.\" This might very well be Lamartine. We then have the malediction\npronounced in face of impassible Nature: \"Yes, I detested that radiant\nand magnificent Nature, for it was there before me in all its stupid\nbeauty, silent and proud, for us to gaze on, believing that it was\nenough to merely show itself.\" This reminds us of Vigny in his _Maison\ndu berger_. Then we have the religion of love: \"Doubt God, doubt men,\ndoubt me if you like, but do not doubt love.\" This is Musset.\n\nBut the theme which predominates, and, as we have compared all this to\nmusic, we might say the _leit-motiv_ of all, is that of desolation, of\nuniversal despair, of the woe of life. It is the same lamentation which,\never since Werther, was to be heard throughout all literature. It is the\nidentical suffering which Rene, Obermann and Lara had been repeating to\nall the echoes. The elements of it were the same: pride which prevents\nus from adapting ourselves to the conditions of universal life, an abuse\nof self-analysis which opens up our wounds again and makes them bleed,\nthe wild imagination which presents to our eyes the deceptive mirage of\nPromised Lands from which we are ever exiles. Lelia personifies, in her\nturn, the \"_mal du siecle_.\" Stenio reproaches her with only singing\ngrief and doubt. \"How many, times,\" he says, \"have you appeared to me\nas typical of the indescribable suffering in which mankind is plunged\nby the spirit of inquiry! With your beauty and your sadness, your\nworld-weariness and your scepticism, do you not personify the excess of\ngrief produced by the abuse of thought?\" He then adds: \"There is a great\ndeal of pride in this grief, Lelia!\" It was undoubtedly a malady, for\nLelia had no reason to complain of life any more than her brothers in\ndespair. It is simply that the general conditions of life which all\npeople have to accept seem painful to them. When we are well the play of\nour muscles is a joy to us, but when we are ill we feel the very weight\nof the atmosphere, and our eyes are hurt by the pleasant daylight.\n\nWhen _Lelia_ appeared George Sand's old friends were stupefied. \"What,\nin Heaven's name, is this?\" wrote Jules Neraud, the _Malgache._ \"Where\nhave you been in search of this? Why have you written such a book?\nWhere has it sprung from, and what is it for? . . . This woman is a\nfantastical creature. She is not at all like you. You are lively and can\ndance a jig; you can appreciate butterflies and you do not despise puns.\nYou sew and can make jam very well.\"(18)\n\n     (18) _Histoire de ma vie_.\n\nIt certainly was not her portrait. She was healthy and believed in life,\nin the goodness of things and in the future of humanity, just as Victor\nHugo and Dumas _pere_, those other forces of Nature, did, at about the\nsame time. A soul foreign to her own had entered into her, and it was\nthe romantic soul. With the magnificent power of receptivity which she\npossessed, George Sand welcomed all the winds which came to her from\nthe four quarters of romanticism. She sent them back with unheard-of\nfulness, sonorous depth and wealth of orchestration. From that time\nforth a woman's voice could be heard, added to all the masculine voices\nwhich railed against life, and the woman's voice dominated them all!\n\nIn George Sand's psychological evolution, _Lelia_ is just this: the\nbeginning of the invasion of her soul by romanticism. It was a borrowed\nindividuality, undoubtedly, but it was not something to be put on and\noff at will like a mask. It adhered to the skin. It was all very fine\nfor George Sand to say to Sainte-Beuve: \"Do not confuse the man himself\nwith the suffering. . . . And do not believe in all my satanical airs.\n. . . This is simply a style that I have taken on, I assure you. . . .\"\n\nSainte-Beuve had every reason to be alarmed, and the confessor was quite\nright in his surmises. The crisis of romanticism had commenced. It\nwas to take an acute form and to reach its paroxysm during the Venice\nescapade. It is from this point of view that we will study the famous\nepisode, which has already been studied by so many other writers.\n\n\nNo subject, perhaps, has excited the curiosity of readers like this one,\nand always without satisfying that curiosity. A library could be formed\nof the books devoted to this subject, written within the last ten years.\nMonsieur Rocheblave, Monsieur Maurice Clouard, Dr. Cabanes, Monsieur\nMarieton, the enthusiastic collector, Spoelberch de Lovenjoul and\nMonsieur Decori have all given us their contributions to the debate.(19)\nThanks to them, we have the complete correspondence of George Sand and\nMusset, the diary of George Sand and Pagello's diary.\n\n     (19) Consult:  Rocheblave, _La fin dune Legende;_ Maurice\n     Clouard, _Documents inedits sur A. de Musset;_ Dr. Cabanes,\n     _Musset et le Dr. Pagello_; Paul Marieton, _Une histoire\n     d'amour;_ Vicomte Spoelberch de Lovenjoul, _La vrai histoire\n     d'Elle et Lui;_ Decori, _Lettres de George Sand et Musset._\n\nWith the aid of all these documents Monsieur Charles Maurras has written\na book entitled _Les Amants de Venise_. It is the work of a psychologist\nand of an artist. The only fault I have to find with it is that the\nauthor of it seems to see calculation and artifice everywhere, and not\nto believe sufficiently in sincerity. We must not forget, either, that\nas early as the year 1893, all that is essential had been told us by\nthat shrewd writer and admirable woman, Arvede Barine. The chapter which\nshe devotes to the Venice episode, in her biography of Alfred de Musset,\nis more clear and simple, and at the same time deeper than anything that\nhad yet been written.\n\nIt is a subject that has been given up to the curiosity of people and\nto their disputes. The strange part is the zeal which at once animates\nevery one who takes part in this controversy. The very atmosphere seems\nto be impregnated with strife, and those interested become, at once,\nthe partisans of George Sand or the partisans of Musset. The two parties\nonly agree on one point, and that is, to throw all the blame on the\nclient favoured by their adversary. I must confess that I cannot take\na passionate interest in a discussion, the subject of which we cannot\nproperly judge. According to _Mussetistes_, it was thanks to George\nSand that the young poet was reduced to the despair which drove him to\ndebauchery. On the other hand, if we are to believe the _Sandistes_,\nGeorge Sand's one idea in interesting herself in Musset was to rescue\nhim from debauchery and convert him to a better life. I listen to all\nsuch pious interpretations, but I prefer others for myself. I prefer\nseeing the physiognomy of each of the two lovers standing out, as it\ndoes, in powerful relief.\n\nIt is the custom, too, to pity these two unfortunates, who suffered so\nmuch. At the risk of being taken for a very heartless man, I must own\nthat I do not pity them much. The two lovers wished for this suffering,\nthey wanted to experience the incomparable sensations of it, and they\ngot enjoyment and profit from this. They knew that they were working for\nposterity. \"Posterity will repeat our names like those of the immortal\nlovers whose two names are only one at present, like Romeo and Juliette,\nlike Heloise and Abelard. People will never speak of one of us without\nspeaking of the other.\"\n\nJuliette died at the age of fifteen and Heloise entered a convent. The\nVenice lovers did not have to pay for their celebrity as dearly as\nthat. They wanted to give an example, to light a torch on the road of\nhumanity. \"People shall know my story,\" writes George Sand. \"I will\nwrite it. . . . Those who follow along the path I trod will see where it\nleads.\" _Et nunc erudimini_. Let us see for ourselves, and learn.\n\nTheir _liaison_ dates from August, 1833.\n\nGeorge Sand was twenty-nine years of age. It was the time of her\ngreatest charm. We must try to imagine the enchantress as she then\nwas. She was not tall and she was delightfully slender, with an\nextraordinary-looking face of dark, warm colouring. Her thick hair was\nvery dark, and her eyes, her large eyes, haunted Musset for years after.\n\n     \"_Ote-moi, memoire importune_,\n     _Ote-moi ces yeux que  je vois toujours!_\"\n\nhe writes.\n\n\nAnd this woman, who could have been loved passionately, merely for her\ncharm as a woman, was a celebrity! She was a woman of genius! Alfred de\nMusset was twenty-three years old. He was elegant, witty, a flirt, and\nwhen he liked he could be irresistible. He had won his reputation by\nthat explosion of gaiety and imagination, _Les Contes d'Espagne el\nd'Italle_. He had written some fine poetry, dreamy, disturbing and\ndaring. He had also given _Les Caprices de Marianne_, in which he\nfigures twice over himself, for he was both Octave the sceptic, the\ndisillusioned man, and Coelio, the affectionate, candid Coelio. He\nimagined himself Rolla. It was he, and he alone, who should have been\nstyled the sublime boy.\n\nAnd so here they both are. We might call them Lelia and Stenio, but\n_Lelia_ was written before the Venice adventure. She was not the\nreflection of it, but rather the presentiment. This is worthy of notice,\nbut not at all surprising. Literature sometimes imitates reality, but\nhow much more often reality is modelled on literature!\n\nIt was as though George Sand had foreseen her destiny, for she had\nfeared to meet Musset. On the 11th of March, she writes as follows to\nSainte-Beuve: \"On second thoughts, I do not want you to bring Alfred de\nMusset. He is a great dandy. We should not suit each other, and I was\nreally more curious to see him than interested in him.\" A little later\non, though, at a dinner at the _Freres provencaux_, to which Buloz\ninvited his collaborators, George Sand found herself next Alfred de\nMusset. She invited him to call on her, and when _Lelia_ was published\nshe sent him a copy, with the following dedication written in the first\nvolume: _A Monsieur mon gamin d'Allred_; and in the second volume: _A\nMonsieur le vicomte Allred de Musset, hommage respectueux de son devoue\nserviteur George Sand_. Musset replied by giving his opinion of the new\nbook. Among the letters which followed, there is one that begins with\nthese words: \"My dear George, I have something silly and ridiculous to\ntell you. I am foolishly writing, instead of telling you, as I ought to\nhave done, after our walk. I am heartbroken to-night that I did not tell\nyou. You will laugh at me, and you will take me for a man who simply\ntalks nonsense. You will show me the door, and fancy that I am not\nspeaking the truth. . . . I am in love with you. . . .\"\n\nShe did not laugh at him, though, and she did not show him the door.\nThings did not drag on long, evidently, as she writes to her confessor,\nSainte-Beuve, on the 25th of August: \"I have fallen in love, and very\nseriously this time, with Alfred de Musset.\" How long was this to\nlast? She had no idea, but for the time being she declared that she was\nabsolutely happy.\n\n\"I have found a candour, a loyalty and an affection which delight me. It\nis the love of a young man and the friendship of a comrade.\" There was\na honeymoon in the little flat looking on the Quay Malaquals. Their\nfriends shared the joy of the happy couple, as we see by Musset's\nfrolicsome lines:\n\n     _George est dans sa chambrette,\n     Entre deux pots de fleurs,\n     Fumiant sa cigarette,\n     Les yeux baignes de pleurs._\n\n     _Buloz assis par terre\n     Lui fait de doux serments,\n     Solange par derriere\n     Gribouille ses romans._\n\n     _Plante commme une borne_,\n     _Boucoiran tout crott_,\n     _Contemple d'un oeil morne_\n     _Musset tout debraille, etc._\n\nIt is evident that, as poetry, this does not equal the _Nuits._\n\nIn the autumn they went for a honeymoon trip to Fontainebleau. It was\nthere that the strange scene took place which is mentioned in _Elle\net Lui_. One evening when they were in the forest, Musset had an\nextraordinary hallucination, which he has himself described:\n\n     _Dans tin bois, sur une bruyere,\n     Au pied d'un arbre vint s'asseoir\n     Un jeune homme vetu de noir\n     Qui me ressemblail comme un frere._\n\n     _Le lui demandais mon chemin,\n     Il tenait un luth d'ue main,\n     De l'autre un bouquet d'eglantine.\n     Il me fit tin salut d'ami\n     Et, se detournant a demu,\n     Me montra du doigt la colline._\n\nHe really saw this \"double,\" dressed in black, which was to visit him\nagain later on. His _Nuit de decembre_ was written from it.\n\nThey now wanted to see Italy together. Musset had already written on\nVenice; he now wanted to go there. Madame de Musset objected to this,\nbut George Sand promised so sincerely that she would be a mother to the\nyoung man that finally his own mother gave her consent. On the evening\nof December 12, 1833, Paul de Musset accompanied the two travellers to\nthe mail-coach. On the boat from Lyons to Avignon they met with a big,\nintelligent-looking man. This was Beyle-Stendhal, who was then Consul at\nCivita-Vecchia. He was on his way to his post. They enjoyed his lively\nconversation, although he made fun of their illusions about Italy and\nthe Italian character. He made fun, though, of everything and of every\none, and they felt that he was only being witty and trying to appear\nunkind. At dinner he drank too much, and finished by dancing round the\ntable in his great fur-lined boots. Later on he gave them some specimens\nof his obscene conversation, so that they were glad to continue their\njourney without him.\n\nOn the 28th the travellers reached Florence. The aspect of this city and\nhis researches in the _Chroniques florentines_ supplied the poet with\nthe subject for _Lorenzaccio_. It appears that George Sand and Musset\neach treated this subject, and that a _Lorenzaccio_ by George Sand\nexists. I have not read it, but I prefer Musset's version. They reached\nVenice on January 19, 1834, and put up at the Hotel Danieli. By this\ntime they were at loggerheads.\n\nThe cause of their quarrel and disagreement is not really known, and the\nactivity of retrospective journalists has not succeeded in finding this\nout. George Sand's letters only give details about their final quarrel.\nOn arriving, George Sand was ill, and this exasperated Musset. He was\nannoyed, and declared that a woman out of sorts was very trying. There\nare good reasons for believing that he had found her very trying for\nsome time. He was very elegant and she a learned \"white blackbird.\"\nHe was capricious and she a placid, steady _bourgeois_ woman, very\nhard-working and very regular in the midst of her irregularity. He used\nto call her \"personified boredom, the dreamer, the silly woman, the\nnun,\" when he did not use terms which we cannot transcribe. The climax\nwas when he said to her: \"I was mistaken, George, and I beg your pardon,\nfor I do not love you.\"\n\nWounded and offended, she replied: \"We do not love each other any\nlonger, and we never really loved each other.\"\n\nThey therefore took back their independence. This is a point to note,\nas George Sand considered this fact of the greatest importance, and she\nconstantly refers to it. She was from henceforth free, as regarded her\ncompanion.\n\nIllness kept them now at Venice. George Sand's illness first and then\nMusset's alarming malady. He had high fever, accompanied by chest\naffection and attacks of delirium which lasted six consecutive hours,\nduring which it took four men to hold him.\n\n\nGeorge Sand was an admirable nurse. This must certainly be acknowledged.\nShe sat up with him at night and she nursed him by day, and, astonishing\nwoman that she was, she was also able to work and to earn enough to pay\ntheir common expenses. This is well known, but I am able to give another\nproof of it, in the letters which George Sand wrote from Venice to\nBuloz. These letters have been communicated to me by Madame Pailleron,\n_nee_ Buloz, and by Madame Landouzy, _veuve_ Buloz, whom I thank for\nthe public and for myself. The following are a few of the essential\npassages:\n\n\n\"February 4. _Read this when you are alone._\n\n\"MY DEAR BULOZ,--Your reproaches reach me at a miserable moment. If you\nhave received my letter, you already know that I do not deserve them.\nA fortnight ago I was well again and working. Alfred was working too,\nalthough he was not very well and had fits of feverishness. About five\ndays ago we were both taken ill, almost at the same time. I had an\nattack of dysentery, which caused me horrible suffering. I have not yet\nrecovered from it, but I am strong enough, anyhow, to nurse him. He was\nseized with a nervous and inflammatory fever, which has made such rapid\nprogress that the doctor tells me he does not know what to think about\nit. We must wait for the thirteenth or fourteenth day before knowing\nwhether his life is in danger. And what will this thirteenth or\nfourteenth day be? Perhaps his last one? I am in despair, overwhelmed\nwith fatigue, suffering horribly, and awaiting who knows what future?\nHow can I give myself up to literature or to anything in the world at\nsuch a time? I only know that our entire fortune, at present, consists\nof sixty francs, that we shall have to spend an enormous amount at the\nchemist's, for the nurse and doctor, and that we are at a very expensive\nhotel. We were just about to leave it and go to a private house. Alfred\ncannot be moved now, and even if everything should go well, he probably\ncannot be moved for a month. We shall have to pay one term's rent for\nnothing, and we shall return to France, please God. If my ill-luck\ncontinues, and if Alfred should die, I can assure you that I do not care\nwhat happens after to me. If God allows Alfred to recover, I do not\nknow how we shall pay the expenses of his illness and of his return to\nFrance. The thousand francs that you are to send me will not suffice,\nand I do not know what we shall do. At any rate, do not delay sending\nthat, as, by the time it arrives, it will be more than necessary. I am\nsorry about the annoyance you are having with the delay for publishing,\nbut you can now judge whether it is my fault. If only Alfred had a few\nquiet days, I could soon finish my work. But he is in a frightful state\nof delirium and restlessness. I cannot leave him an instant. I have been\nnine hours writing this letter. Adieu, my friend, and pity me.\n\n\"GEORGE.\n\n\"Above everything, do not tell any one, not any one in the world, that\nAlfred is ill. If his mother heard (and it only needs two persons for\ntelling a secret to all Paris) she would go mad. If she has to be told,\nlet who will undertake to tell her, but if in a fortnight Alfred is out\nof danger, it is useless for her to grieve now. Adieu.\"\n\n\n\"February 13, 1834.\n\n\"My friend, Alfred is saved. There has been no fresh attack, and we\nhave nearly reached the fourteenth day without the improvement having\naltered. After the brain affection inflammation of the lungs declared\nitself, and this rather alarmed us for two days. . . . He is extremely\nweak at present, and he wanders occasionally. He has to be nursed night\nand day. Do not imagine, therefore, that I am only making pretexts for\nthe delay in my work. I have not undressed for eight nights. I sleep on\na sofa, and have to get up at any minute. In spite of this, ever since\nI have been relieved in my mind about the danger, I have been able to\nwrite a few pages in the mornings while he is resting. You may be sure\nthat I should like to be able to take advantage of this time to rest\nmyself. Be assured, my friend, that I am not short of courage, nor yet\nof the will to work. You are not more anxious than I am that I should\ncarry out my engagements. You know that a debt makes me smart like a\nwound. But you are friend enough to make allowances for my situation and\nnot to leave me in difficulties. I am spending very wretched days here\nat this bedside, for the slightest sound, the slightest movement causes\nme constant terror. In this disposition of mind I shall not write any\nlight works. They will be heavy, on the contrary, like my fatigue and my\nsadness.\n\n\"Do not leave me without money, I beseech you, or I do not know what\nwill happen to me. I spend about twenty francs a day in medicine of all\nsorts. We do not know how to keep him alive. . . .\"\n\n\nThese letters give the lie to some of the gossip that has been spread\nabroad with regard to the episode of the Hotel Danieli. And I too,\nthanks to these letters, shall have put an end to a legend! In the\nsecond volume of Wladimir Karenine's work on George Sand, on page 61, we\nhave the following words--\n\n\"Monsieur Plauchut tells us that, according to Buloz, Musset had been\nenticed into a gambling hell during his stay in Venice, and had lost\nabout four hundred pounds there. The imprudent young man could not pay\nthis debt of honour, and he never would have been able to do so. He had\nto choose between suicide or dishonour. George Sand did not hesitate a\nmoment. She wrote at once to the manager of the _Revue_, asking him to\nadvance the money.\" And this debt was on her shoulders for a long time.\n\nThe facts of the case are as follows, according to a letter from George\nSand to Buloz: \"I beseech you, as a favour, to pay Alfred's debt and to\nwrite to him that it is all settled. You cannot imagine the impatience\nand the disturbance that this little matter cause him. He speaks to me\nof it every minute, and begs me every day to write to you about it. He\nowes these three hundred and sixty francs (L14 8_s_.) to a young man\nhe knows very little and who might talk of it to people. . . . You have\nalready advanced much larger sums to him. He has always paid you back,\nand you are not afraid that this would make you bankrupt. If, through\nhis illness, he should not be able to work for a long time, my work\ncould be used for that, so be at ease. . . . Do this, I beseech you, and\nwrite him a short letter to ease his mind at once. I will then read it\nto him, and this will pacify one of the torments of his poor head. Oh,\nmy friend, if you only knew what this delirium is like! What sublime and\nawful things he has said, and then what convulsions and shouts! I do not\nknow how he has had strength enough to pull through and how it is that I\nhave not gone mad myself. Adieu, adieu, my friend.\"\n\nThere really was a gambling debt, then, but we do not know exactly where\nit was contracted. It amounted to three hundred and sixty francs,\nwhich is very different from the ten thousand francs and the threat of\nsuicide.\n\nAnd now we come to the pure folly! Musset had been attended by a young\ndoctor, Pietro Pagello. He was a straightforward sort of young man,\nof rather slow intelligence, without much conversation, not speaking\nFrench, but very handsome. George Sand fell in love with him. One night,\nafter having scribbled a letter of three pages, she put it into an\nenvelope without any address and gave it to Pagello. He asked her to\nwhom he was to give the letter. George Sand took the envelope back and\nwrote on it: \"To stupid Pagello.\" We have this declaration, and among\nother things in the letter are the following lines: \"You will not\ndeceive me, anyhow. You will not make any idle promises and false\nvows. . . . I shall not, perhaps, find in you what I have sought for in\nothers, but, at any rate, I can always believe that you possess it.\n. . . I shall be able to interpret your meditations and make your silence\nspeak eloquently. . . .\" This shows us clearly the kind of charm George\nSand found in Pagello. She loved him because he was stupid.\n\nThe next questions are, when did they become lovers, and how did Musset\ndiscover their intimacy? It is quite certain that he suspected it,\nand that he made Pagello confess his love for George Sand.(20) A most\nextraordinary scene then took place between the three of them, according\nto George Sand's own account. \"Adieu, then,\" she wrote to Musset, later\non, \"adieu to the fine poem of our sacred friendship and of that ideal\nbond formed between the three of us, when you dragged from him the\nconfession of his love for me and when he vowed to you that he would\nmake me happy. Oh, that night of enthusiasm, when, in spite of us, you\njoined our hands, saying: 'You love each other and yet you love me,\nfor you have saved me, body and soul.\" Thus, then, Musset had solemnly\nabjured his love for George Sand, he had engaged his mistress of the\nnight before to a new lover, and was from henceforth to be their best\nfriend. Such was the ideal bond, such the sacred friendship! This may be\nconsidered the romantic escapade.\n\n     (20) On one of George Sand's unpublished letters to Buloz\n     the following lines are written in the handwriting of Buloz:\n\n     \"In the morning on getting up he discovered, in an adjoining\n     room, a tea-table still set, but with only one cup.\n\n     \"'Did you have tea yesterday evening?'\n\n     \"'Yes,' answered George Sand, 'I had tea with the doctor.'\n\n     \"'Ah, how is it that there is only one cup?'\n\n     \"'The other has been taken away.'\n\n     \"'No, nothing has been taken away.  You drank out of the\n     same cup.'\n\n     \"'Even if that were so, you have no longer the right to\n     trouble about such things.'\n\n     \"'I have the right, as I am still supposed to be your lover.\n     You ought at least to show me respect, and, as I am leaving\n     in three days, you might wait until I have gone to do as you\n     like.'\n\n     \"The night following this scene Musset discovered George\n     Sand, crouching on her bed, writing a letter.\n\n     \"'What are you doing?' he asked.\n\n     \"'I am reading,' she replied, and she blew out the candle.\n\n     \"'If you are reading, why do you put the candle out?'\n\n     \"'It went out itself:  light it again.'\n\n     \"Alfred de Musset lit it again.\n\n     \"'Ah, so you were reading, and you have no book.  Infamous\n     woman, you might as well say that you are writing to your\n     lover.' George Sand had recourse to her usual threat of\n     leaving the house. Alfred de Musset read her up:  'You are\n     thinking of a horrible plan. You want to hurry off to your\n     doctor, pretend that I am mad and that your life is in\n     danger.  You will not leave this room. I will keep you from\n     anything so base.  If you do go, I will put such an epitaph\n     on your grave that the people who read it will turn pale,'\n     said Alfred with terrible energy.\n\n     \"George Sand was trembling and crying.\n\n     \"'I no longer love you,' Alfred said scoffingly to George\n     Sand.\n\n     \"'It is the right moment to take your poison or to go and\n     drown yourself.'\n\n     \"Confession to Alfred of her secret about the doctor.\n     Reconciliation. Alfred's departure.  George Sand's\n     affectionate and enthusiastic letters.\"\n\n     Such are the famous episodes of the _tea-cup_ and _the\n     letter_ as Buloz heard them told at the time.\n\nMusset returned in March, 1834, leaving George Sand with Pagello in\nVenice. The sentimental exaggeration continued, as we see from the\nletters exchanged between Musset and George Sand. When crossing\nthe Simplon the immutable grandeur of the Alps struck Alusset with\nadmiration, and he thought of his two \"great friends.\" His head was\nevidently turned by the heights from which he looked at things. George\nSand wrote to him: \"I am not giving you any message from Pagello,\nexcept that he is almost as sad as I am at your absence.\" \"He is a fine\nfellow,\" answered Musset. \"Tell him how much I like him, and that my\neyes fill with tears when I think of him.\" Later on he writes: \"When I\nsaw Pagello, I recognized in him the better side of my own nature,\nbut pure and free from the irreparable stains which have ruined mine.\"\n\"Always treat me like that,\" writes Musset again. \"It makes me feel\nproud. My dear friend, the woman who talks of her new lover in this way\nto the one she has given up, but who still loves her, gives him a proof\nof the greatest esteem that a man can receive from a woman. . . .\" That\nromanticism which made a drama of the situation in _L'Ecole des Femmes_,\nand another one out of that in the _Precieuses ridicules_, excels in\ntaking tragically situations that belong to comedy and in turning them\ninto the sublime.\n\nMeanwhile George Sand had settled down in Venice with Pagello--and with\nall the family, all the Pagello tribe, with the brother, the sister, to\nsay nothing of the various rivals who came and made scenes. It was the\nvulgar, ordinary platitude of an Italian intimacy of this kind. In spite\nof everything, she continued congratulating herself on her choice.\n\n\"I have my love, my stay here with me. He never suffers, for he is never\nweak or suspicious. . . . He is calm and good. . . . He loves me and is\nat peace; he is happy without my having to suffer, without my having to\nmake efforts for his happiness. . . . As for me, I must suffer for some\none. It is just this suffering which nurtures my maternal solicitude,\netc. . . .\" She finally begins to weary of her dear Pagello's stupidity.\nIt occurred to her to take him with her to Paris, and that was the\nclimax. There are some things which cannot be transplanted from one\ncountry to another. When they had once set foot in Paris, the absurdity\nof their situation appeared to them.\n\n\"From the moment that Pagello landed in France,\" says George Sand, \"he\ncould not understand anything.\" The one thing that he was compelled to\nunderstand was that he was no longer wanted. He was simply pushed out.\nGeorge Sand had a remarkable gift for bringing out the characteristics\nof the persons with whom she had any intercourse. This Pagello, thanks\nto his adventure with her, has become in the eyes of the world a\npersonage as comic as one of Moliere's characters.\n\nMusset and George Sand still cared for each other. He beseeched her\nto return to him. \"I am good-for-nothing,\" he says, \"for I am simply\nsteeped in my love for you. I do not know whether I am alive, whether I\neat, drink, or breathe, but I know I am in love.\" George Sand was afraid\nto return to him, and Sainte-Beuve forbade her. Love proved stronger\nthan all other arguments, however, and she yielded.\n\nAs soon as she was with him once more, their torture commenced again,\nwith all the customary complaints, reproaches and recriminations. \"I was\nquite sure that all these reproaches would begin again immediately after\nthe happiness we had dreamed of and promised each other. Oh, God, to\nthink that we have already arrived at this!\" she writes.\n\nWhat tortured them was that the past, which they had believed to be \"a\nbeautiful poem,\" now seemed to them a hideous nightmare. All this, we\nread, was a game that they were playing. A cruel sort of game, of which\nMusset grew more and more weary, but which to George Sand gradually\nbecame a necessity. We see this, as from henceforth it was she who\nimplored Musset. In her diary, dated December 24, 1834, we read: \"And\nwhat if I rushed to him when my love is too strong for me. What if I\nwent and broke the bell-pull with ringing, until he opened his door to\nme. Or if I lay down across the threshold until he came out!\" She cut\noff her magnificent hair and sent it to him. Such was the way in which\nthis proud woman humbled herself. She was a prey to love, which seemed\nto her a holy complaint. It was a case of Venus entirely devoted to her\nprey. The question is, was this really love? \"I no longer love you,\" she\nwrites, \"but I still adore you. I do not want you any more, but I cannot\ndo without you.\" They had the courage to give each other up finally in\nMarch, 1835.\n\nIt now remains for us to explain the singularity of this adventure,\nwhich, as a matter of fact, was beyond all logic, even the logic of\npassion. It is, however, readily understood, if we treat it as a case\nof acute romanticism, the finest case of romanticism, that has been\nactually lived, which the history of letters offers us.\n\nThe romanticism consists first in exposing one's life to the public, in\npublishing one's most secret joys and sorrows. From the very beginning\nGeorge Sand and Musset took the whole circle of their friends into their\nconfidence. These friends were literary people. George Sand specially\ninforms Sainte-Beuve that she wishes her sentimental life from\nthenceforth to be known. They were quite aware that they were on show,\nas it were, subjects of an experiment that would be discussed by \"the\ngallery.\"\n\nRomanticism consists next in the writer putting his life into his\nbooks, making literature out of his emotions. The idea of putting their\nadventure into a story occurred to the two lovers before the adventure\nhad come to an end. It was at Venice that George Sand wrote her first\n_Lettres d'un voyageur_, addressed to the poet--and to the subscribers\nof the _Revue des Deux Mondes_. Musset, to improve on this idea, decides\nto write a novel from the episode which was still unfinished. \"I will\nnot die,\" he says, \"until I have written my book on you and on myself,\nmore particularly on you. No, my beautiful, holy fiancee, you shall not\nreturn to this cold earth before it knows the woman who has walked on\nit. No, I swear this by my youth and genius.\" Musset's contributions to\nthis literature were _Confession d'un enfant du siecle_, _Histoire d'un\nmerle blanc_, _Elle et Lui_, and all that followed.\n\nIn an inverse order, romanticism consists in putting literature into our\nlife, in taking the latest literary fashion for our rule of action. This\nis not only a proof of want of taste; it is a most dangerous mistake.\nThe romanticists, who had so many wrong ideas, had none more erroneous\nthan their idea of love, and in the correspondence between George Sand\nand Musset we see the paradox in all its beauty. It consists in saying\nthat love leads to virtue and that it leads there through change.\nWhether the idea came originally from _her_ or from _him_, this was\ntheir common faith.\n\n\"You have said it a hundred times over,\" writes George Sand, \"and it\nis all in vain that you retract; nothing will now efface that sentence:\n'Love is the only thing in the world that counts.' It may be that it\nis a divine faculty which we lose and then find again, that we must\ncultivate, or that we have to buy with cruel suffering, with painful\nexperience. The suffering you have endured through loving me was perhaps\ndestined, in order that you might love another woman more easily.\nPerhaps the next woman may love you less than I do, and yet she may be\nmore happy and more beloved. There are such mysteries in these things,\nand God urges us along new and untrodden paths. Give in; do not attempt\nto resist. He does not desert His privileged ones. He takes them by the\nhand and places them in the midst of the sandbanks, where they are to\nlearn to live, in order that they may sit down at the banquet at which\nthey are to rest. . . .\" Later on she writes as follows: \"Do you imagine\nthat one love affair, or even two, can suffice for exhausting or taking\nthe freshness from a strong soul? I believed this, too, for a long\ntime, but I know now that it is quite the contrary. Love is a fire that\nendeavours to rise and to purify itself. Perhaps the more we have failed\nin our endeavours to find it, the more apt we become to discover it, and\nthe more we have been obliged to change, the more conservative we\nshall become. Who knows? It is perhaps the terrible, magnificent and\ncourageous work of a whole lifetime. It is a crown of thorns which will\nblossom and be covered with roses when our hair begins to turn white.\"\n\nThis was pure frenzy, and yet there were two beings ready to drink in\nall this pathos, two living beings to live out this monstrous chimera.\nSuch are the ravages that a certain conception of literature may make.\nBy the example we have of these two illustrious victims, we may imagine\nthat there were others, and very many others, obscure and unknown\nindividuals, but human beings all the same, who were equally duped.\nThere are unwholesome fashions in literature, which, translated into\nlife, mean ruin. The Venice adventure shows up the truth of this in\nbright daylight. This is its interest and its lesson.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nTHE FRIEND OF MICHEL (DE BOURGES)\n\nLISZT AND COMTESSE D'AGOULT. _MAUPRAT_\n\n\nWe have given the essential features of the Venice adventure. The love\naffair, into which George Sand and Musset had put so much literature,\nwas to serve literature. Writers of the romantic school are given to\nmaking little songs with their great sorrows. When the correspondence\nbetween George Sand and Musset appeared, every one was surprised to\nfind passages that were already well known. Such passages had already\nappeared in the printed work of the poet or of the authoress. An idea,\na word, or an illustration used by the one was now, perhaps, to be found\nin the work of the other one.\n\n\"It is I who have lived,\" writes George Sand, \"and not an unreal being\ncreated by my pride and my _ennui_.\" We all know the use to which Musset\nput this phrase. He wrote the famous couplet of Perdican with it: \"All\nmen are untruthful, inconstant, false, chatterers, hypocritical, proud,\ncowardly, contemptible and sensual; all women are perfidious, artful,\nvain, inquisitive and depraved. . . . There is, though, in this world\none thing which is holy and sublime. It is the union of these two\nbeings, imperfect and frightful as they are. We are often deceived in\nour love; we are often wounded and often unhappy, but still we love, and\nwhen we are on the brink of the tomb we shall turn round, look back,\nand say to ourselves: 'I have often suffered, I have sometimes been\ndeceived, but I have loved. It is I who have lived, and not an unreal\nbeing created by my pride and _ennui_.'\" Endless instances of this kind\ncould be given. They are simply the sign of the reciprocal influence\nexercised over each other by George Sand and Musset, an influence to be\ntraced through all their work.\n\nThis influence was of a different kind and of unequal degree. It was\nGeorge Sand who first made literature of their common recollections.\nSome of these recollections were very recent ones and were impregnated\nwith tears. The two lovers had only just separated when George Sand made\nthe excursion described in the first _Lettre d'un voyageur_. She goes\nalong the Brenta. It is the month of May, and the meadows are in flower.\nIn the horizon she sees the snowy peaks of the Tyrolese Alps standing\nout. The remembrance of the long hours spent at the invalid's bedside\ncomes back to her, with all the anguish of the sacred passion in which\nshe thinks she sees God's anger. She then pays a visit to the Oliero\ngrottoes, and once more her wounded love makes her heart ache. She\nreturns through Possagno, whose beautiful women served as models for\nCanova. She then goes back to Venice, and the doctor gives her a letter\nfrom the man she has given up, the man she has sent away. These poetical\ndescriptions, alternating with lyrical effusions, this kind of dialogue\nwith two voices, one of which is that of nature and the other that of\nthe heart, remind us of one of Musset's _Nuits_.\n\nThe second of these _Lettres d'un voyageur_ is entirely descriptive. It\nis spring-time in Venice. The old balconies are gay with flowers; the\nnightingales stop singing to listen to the serenades. There are songs\nto be heard at every street corner, music in the wake of every gondola.\nThere are sweet perfumes and love-sighs in the air. The delights of the\nVenetian nights had never been described like this. The harmony of \"the\nthree elements, water, sky and marble,\" had never been better expressed,\nand the charm of Venice had never been suggested in so subtle and,\npenetrating a manner. The second letter treats too of the gondoliers,\nand of their habits and customs.\n\nThe third letter, telling us about the nobility and the women of Venice,\ncompletes the impression. Just as the Pyrenees had moved George Sand, so\nItaly now moved her. This was a fresh acquisition for her palette. More\nthan once from henceforth Venice was to serve her for the wonderful\nscenery of her stories. This is by no means a fresh note, though, in\nGeorge Sand's work. There is no essential difference, then, in her\ninspiration. She had always been impressionable, but her taste was\nnow getting purer. Musset, the most romantic of French poets, had an\neminently classical taste. In the _Lettres de Dupuis et Cotonet_, he\ndefined romanticism as an abuse of adjectives. He was of Madame de\nLafayette's opinion, that a word taken out was worth twenty pennies, and\na phrase taken out twenty shillings. In a copy of _Indiana_ he crossed\nout all the useless epithets. This must have made a considerable\ndifference to the length of the book. George Sand was too broad-minded\nto be hurt by such criticism, and she was intelligent enough to learn a\nlesson from it.\n\nMusset's transformation was singularly deeper. When he started for\nVenice, he was the youngest and most charming of poets, fanciful and\nfull of fun. \"Monsieur mon gamin d'Alfred,\" George Sand called him at\nthat time. When he returned from there, he was the saddest of poets. For\nsome time he was, as it were, stunned. His very soul seemed to be bowed\ndown with his grief. He was astonished at the change he felt in himself,\nand he did not by any means court any fresh inspiration.\n\n     _J'ai vu, le temps ou ma jeunesse_\n     _Sur mes levres etait sans cesse_\n     _Prete a chanter comme un oiseau;_\n     _Mais j'ai souffert un dur martyre_\n     _Et le moins que j'en pourrais dire_,\n     _Si je lessayais sur a lyre_,\n     _La briserait comme un roseau_,\n\nhe writes.\n\nIn the _Nuit de Mai_, the earliest of these songs of despair, we have\nthe poet's symbol of the pelican giving its entrails as food to its\nstarving young. The only symbols that we get in this poetry are symbols\nof sadness, and these are at times given in magnificent fulness of\ndetail. We have solitude in the _Nuit de decembre_, and the labourer\nwhose house has been burnt in the _Lettre a Lamartine_. The _Nuit\nd'aout_ gives proof of a wild effort to give life another trial, but in\nthe _Auit d'octobre_ anger gets the better of him once more.\n\n     _Honte a toi, qui la premiere\n     M'as appris la trahison . . . !_\n\nThe question has often been asked whether the poet refers here to the\nwoman he loved in Venice but it matters little whether he did or not.\nHe only saw her through the personage who from henceforth symbolized\n\"woman\" to him and the suffering which she may cause a man. And yet, as\nthis suffering became less intense, softened as it was by time, he began\nto discover the benefit of it. His soul had expanded, so that he was now\nin communion with all that is great in Nature and in Art. The harmony\nof the sky, the silence of night, the murmur of flowing water, Petrarch,\nMichel Angelo, Shakespeare, all appealed to him. The day came when he\ncould write:\n\n     _Un souvenir heureux est peut-etre sur terre\n     Plus vrai que le bonheur_.\n\nThis is the only philosophy for a conception of life which treats love\nas everything for man. He not only pardons now, but he is grateful:\n\n     _Je ne veux rien savoir, ni si les champs fleurissent,\n     Nice quil adviendra di., simulacre humain,\n     Ni si ces vastes cieux eclaireront demain\n     Ce qu' ils ensevelissent heure, en ce lieu,\n     Je me dis seulement:  a cette\n     Un jour, je fus aime, j'aimais, elle etait belle,\n     Jenfouis ce tresor dans mon ame immortelle\n     Et je l'em porte a Dieu._\n\nThis love poem, running through all he wrote from the _Nuit de Mai_\nto the _Souvenir_, is undoubtedly the most beautiful and the most\nprofoundly human of anything in the French language. The charming poet\nhad become a great poet. That shock had occurred within him which is\nfelt by the human being to the very depths of his soul, and makes of him\na new creature. It is in this sense that the theory of the romanticists,\nwith regard to the educative virtues of suffering, is true. But it is\nnot only suffering in connection with our love affairs which has this\nspecial privilege. After some misfortune which uproots, as it were, our\nlife, after some disappointment which destroys our moral edifice, the\nworld appears changed to us. The whole network of accepted ideas and\nof conventional opinions is broken asunder. We find ourselves in direct\ncontact with reality, and the shock makes our true nature come to the\nfront. . . . Such was the crisis through which Musset had just passed.\nThe man came out of it crushed and bruised, but the poet came through it\ntriumphant.\n\nIt has been insisted on too much that George Sand was only the\nreflection of the men who had approached her. In the case of Musset\nit was the contrary. Musset owed her more than she owed to him. She\ntransformed him by the force of her strong individuality. She, on the\ncontrary, only found in Musset a child, and what she was seeking was a\ndominator.\n\nShe thought she had discovered him this very year 1835.\n\nThe sixth _Lettre d'un voyageur_ was addressed to Everard. This Everard\nwas considered by her to be a superior man. He was so much above the\naverage height that George Sand advised him to sit down when he was with\nother men, as when standing he was too much above them. She compares him\nto Atlas carrying the world, and to Hercules in a lion's skin. But among\nall her comparisons, when she is seeking to give the measure of his\nsuperiority, without ever really succeeding in this, it is evident\nthat the comparison she prefers is that of Marius at Minturnae. He\npersonifies virtue a _l'antique:_ he is the Roman.\n\nLet us now consider to whom all this flattery was addressed, and who\nthis man, worthy of Plutarch's pen, was. His name was Michel, and he was\nan advocate at Bourges. He was only thirty-seven years of age, but he\nlooked sixty. After Sandeau and Musset, George Sand had had enough of\n\"adolescents.\" She was very much struck with Michel, as he looked like\nan old man. The size of his cranium was remarkable, or, as she said of\nhis craniums: \"It seemed as though he had two craniums, one joined to\nthe other.\" She wrote: \"The signs of the superior faculties of his mind\nwere as prominent at the prow of this strong vessel as those of his\ngenerous instincts at the stern.\"(21) In order to understand this\ndefinition of the \"fine physique\" by George Sand, we must remember that\nshe was very much taken up with phrenology at this time. One of her\n_Lettres d'un voyageur_ was entitled Sur _Lavater et sur une Maison\ndeserte_. In a letter to Madame d'Agoult, George Sand tells that her\ngardener gave notice to leave, and, on asking him his reason, the\nsimple-minded man replied: \"Madame has such an ugly head that my wife,\nwho is expecting, might die of fright.\" The head in question was a\nskull, an anatomical one with compartments all marked and numbered,\naccording to the system of Gall and Spurzheim. In 1837, phrenology was\nvery much in favour. In 1910, it is hypnotism, so we have no right to\njudge the infatuation of another epoch.\n\n     (21) _Histoire de ma vie_.\n\nMichel's cranium was bald. He was short, slight, he stooped, was\nshort-sighted and wore glasses. It is George Sand who gives these\ndetails for his portrait. He was born of peasant parents, and was of\nJacobin simplicity. He wore a thick, shapeless inverness and sabots. He\nfelt the cold very much, and used to ask permission to put on a muffler\nindoors. He would then take three or four out of his pockets and put\nthem on his head, one over the other. In the _Lettre d'un voyageur_\nGeorge Sand mentions this crown on Everard's head. Such are the\nillusions of love.\n\nThe first time she met Michel was at Bourges. She went with her two\nfriends, Papet and Fleury, to call on him at the hotel. From seven\no'clock until midnight he never ceased talking. It was a magnificent\nnight, and he proposed a walk in the town at midnight. When they came\nback to his door he insisted on taking them home, and so they continued\nwalking backwards and forwards until four in the morning. He must have\nbeen an inveterate chatterer to have clung to this public of three\npersons at an hour when the great buildings, with the moon throwing its\nwhite light over them and everything around, must have suggested the\nmajesty of silence. To people who were amazed at this irrepressible\neloquence, Michel answered ingenuously: \"Talking is thinking aloud.\nBy thinking aloud in this way I advance more quickly than if I thought\nquietly by myself.\" This was Numa Roumestan's idea. \"As for me,\" he\nsaid, \"when I am not talking, I am not thinking.\" As a matter of fact,\nMichel, like Numa, was a native of Provence. In Paris there was a\nrepetition of this nocturnal and roving scene. Michel and his friends\nhad come to a standstill on the Saints-Peres bridge. They caught sight\nof the Tuileries lighted up for a ball. Michel became excited, and,\nstriking the innocent bridge and its parapet with his stick, he\nexclaimed: \"I tell you that if you are to freshen and renew your corrupt\nsociety, this beautiful river will first have to be red with blood, that\naccursed palace will have to be reduced to ashes, and the huge city you\nare now looking at will have to be a bare strand where the family of the\npoor man can use the plough and build a cottage home.\"\n\nThis was a fine phrase for a public meeting, but perhaps too fine for a\nconversation between friends on the Saints-Peres bridge.\n\nThis was in 1835, at the most brilliant moment of Michel's career. It\nwas when he was taking part in the trial of the accused men of April.\nAfter the insurrections of the preceding year at Lyons and Paris, a\ngreat trial had commenced before the Chamber of Peers. We are told\nthat: \"The Republican party was determined to make use of the\ncross-questioning of the prisoners for accusing the Government and for\npreaching Republicanism and Socialism. The idea was to invite a hundred\nand fifty noted Republicans to Paris from all parts of France. In\ntheir quality of defenders, they would be the orators of this great\nmanifestation.\" Barb'es, Blanqui, Flocon, Marie, Raspail, Trelat and\nMichel of Bourges were among these Republicans. \"On the 11th of May, the\nrevolutionary newspapers published a manifesto in which the committee\nfor the defence congratulated and encouraged the accused men. One\nhundred and ten signatures were affixed to this document, which was a\nforgery. It had been drawn up by a few of the upholders of the scheme,\nand, in order to make it appear more important, they had affixed the\nnames of their colleagues without their authorization. Those who had\ndone this then took fright, and attempted to get out of the dangerous\nadventure by a public avowal. In order to save the situation, two of the\nguilty party, Trelat and Michel of Bourges, took the responsibility of\nthe drawing up of the manifesto and the apposition of the signatures\nupon themselves. They were sentenced by the Court of Peers, Trelat\nto four years of prison and Michel to a month.\"(22) This was the most\nshocking inequality, and Michel could not forgive Trelat for getting\nsuch a fine sentence.\n\n     (22) Thureau Dangin, _Histoire de la Monarchie de Juillet_,\n     II.  297.\n\nWhat good was one month of prison? Michel's career certainly had been a\nvery ordinary one. He hesitated and tacked about. In a word, he was just\na politician. George Sand tells us that he was obliged \"to accept,\nin theory, what he called the necessities of pure politics, ruse,\ncharlatanism and even untruth, concessions that were not sincere,\nalliances in which he did not believe, and vain promises.\" We should say\nthat he was a radical opportunist. To be merely an opportunist, though,\nis not enough for ensuring success. There are different ways of being an\nopportunist. Michel had been elected a Deputy, but he had no _role_ to\nplay. In 1848, he could not compete with the brilliancy of Raspail, nor\nhad he the prestige of Flocon. He went into the shade completely after\nthe _coup d'etat_. For a long time he had really preferred business\nto politics, and a choice must be made when one is not a member of the\nGovernment.\n\nIt is easy to see what charmed George Sand in Michel. He was a\nsectarian, and she took him for an apostle. He was brutal, and she\nthought him energetic. He had been badly brought up, but she thought him\nsimply austere. He was a tyrant, but she only saw in him a master. He\nhad told her that he would have her guillotined at the first possible\nopportunity. This was an incontestable proof of superiority. She was\nsincere herself, and was consequently not on her guard against vain\nboasting. He had alarmed her, and she admired him for this, and at once\nincarnated in him that stoical ideal of which she had been dreaming for\nyears and had not yet been able to attribute to any one else.\n\nThis is how she explained to Michel her reasons for loving him. \"I love\nyou,\" she says, \"because whenever I figure to myself grandeur, wisdom,\nstrength and beauty, your image rises up before me. No other man has\never exercised any moral influence over me. My mind, which has always\nbeen wild and unfettered, has never accepted any guidance. . . . You\ncame, and you have taught me.\" Then again she says: \"It is you whom\nI love, whom I have loved ever since I was born, and through all\nthe phantoms in whom I thought, for a moment, that I had found you.\"\nAccording to this, it was Michel she loved through Musset. Let us hope\nthat she was mistaken.\n\nA whole correspondence exists between George Sand and Michel of Bourges.\nPart of it was published not long ago in the _Revue illustree_ under\nthe title of _Lettres de lemmze_. None of George Sand's letters surpass\nthese epistles to Michel for fervent passion, beauty of form, and a\nkind of superb _impudeur_. Let us take, for instance, this call to\nher beloved. George Sand, after a night of work, complains of fatigue,\nhunger and cold: \"Oh, my lover,\" she cries, \"appear, and, like the earth\non the return of the May sunshine, I should be reanimated, and would\nfling off my shroud of ice and thrill with love. The wrinkles of\nsuffering would disappear from my brow, and I should seem beautiful and\nyoung to you, for I should leap with joy into your iron strong arms.\nCome, come, and I shall have strength, health, youth, gaiety, hope.\n. . . I will go forth to meet you like the bride of the song, 'to her\nwell-beloved.'\" The Well-beloved to whom this Shulamite would hasten was\na bald-headed provincial lawyer who wore spectacles and three mufflers.\nBut it appears that his \"beauty, veiled and unintelligible to the\nvulgar, revealed itself, like that of Jupiter hidden under human form,\nto the women whom he loved.\"\n\nWe must not smile at these mythological comparisons. George Sand had,\nas it were, restored for herself that condition of soul to which the\nancient myths are due. A great current of naturalist poetry circulates\nthrough these pages. In Theocritus and in Rousard there are certain\ndescriptive passages. There is an analogy between them and that image of\nthe horse which carries George Sand along on her impetuous course.\n\n\"As soon as he catches sight of me, he begins to paw the ground and rear\nimpatiently. I have trained him to clear a hundred fathoms a second.\nThe sky and the ground disappear when he bears me along under those long\nvaults formed by the apple-trees in blossom. . . . The least sound of my\nvoice makes him bound like a ball; the smallest bird makes him shudder\nand hurry along like a child with no experience. He is scarcely five\nyears old, and he is timid and restive. His black crupper shines in the\nsunshine like a raven's wing.\" This description has all the relief of an\nantique figure. Another time, George Sand tells how she has seen Phoebus\nthrow off her robe of clouds and rush along radiant into the pure sky.\nThe following day she writes: \"She was eaten by the evil spirits.\nThe dark sprites from Erebus, riding on sombre-looking clouds, threw\nthemselves on her, and it was in vain that she struggled.\" We might\ncompare these passages with a letter of July 10, 1836, in which she\ntells how she throws herself, all dressed as she is, into the Indre,\nand then continues her course through the sunny meadows, and with\nwhat voluptuousness she revels in all the joys of primitive life, and\nimagines herself living in the beautiful times of ancient Greece. There\nare days and pages when George Sand, under the afflux of physical life,\nis pagan. Her genius then is that of the greenwood divinities, who, at\ncertain times of the year, were intoxicated by the odour of the meadows\nand the sap of the woods. If some day we were to have her complete\ncorrespondence given to us, I should not be surprised if many people\npreferred it to her letters to Musset. In the first place, it is not\nspoiled by that preoccupation which the Venice lovers had, of writing\nliterature. Mingled with the accents of sincere passion, we do not find\nextraordinary conceptions of paradoxical metaphysics. It is Nature which\nspeaks in these letters, and for that very reason they are none the less\nsorrowful. They, too, tell us of a veritable martyrdom. We can easily\nimagine from them that Michel was coarse, despotic, faithless and\njealous. We know, too, that more than once George Sand came very near\nlosing all patience with him, so that we can sympathize with her when\nshe wrote to Madame d'Agoult in July, 1836:\n\n\"I have had, my fill of great men (excuse the expression). . . . I\nprefer to see them all in Plutarch, as they would not then cause me any\nsuffering on the human side. May they all be carved in marble or cast in\nbronze, but may I hear no more about them!\" _Amen_.\n\nWhat disgusted George Sand with her Michel was his vanity and his\ncraving for adulation. In July, 1837, she had come to the end of her\npatience, as she wrote to Girerd. It was one of her peculiarities to\nalways take a third person into her confidence. At the time of\nSandeau, this third person was Emile Regnault; at the time of Musset,\nSainte-Beuve, and now it was Girerd. \"I am tired out with my own\ndevotion, and I have fought against my pride with all the strength of my\nlove. I have had nothing but ingratitude and hardness as my recompense.\nI have felt my love dying away and my soul being crushed, but I am cured\nat last. . . .\" If only she had had all this suffering for the sake of a\ngreat man, but this time it was only in imaginary great man.\n\nThe influence, though, that he had had over her thought was real, and in\na certain way beneficial.\n\nAt the beginning she was far from sharing Michel's ideas, and for some\nof them she felt an aversion which amounted to horror. The dogma of\nabsolute equality seemed an absurdity to her. The Republic, or rather\nthe various republics then in gestation, appeared to her a sort of\nUtopia, and as she saw each of her friends making \"his own little\nRepublic\" for himself, she had not much faith in the virtue of that form\nof government for uniting all French people. One point shocked her above\nall others in Michel's theories. This politician did not like artists.\nJust as the Revolution did not find chemists necessary, he considered\nthat the Republic did not need writers, painters and musicians. These\nwere all useless individuals, and the Republic would give them a little\nsurprise by putting a labourer's spade or a shoemaker's awl into their\nhands. George Sand considered this idea not only barbarous, but silly.\n\nTime works wonders, for we have an indisputable proof that certain of\nhis opinions soon became hers. This proof is the Republican catechism\ncontained in her letters to her son Maurice, who was then twelve years\nof age. He was at the Lycee Henri IV, in the same class as the princes\nof Orleans. It is interesting to read what his mother says to him\nconcerning the father of his young school friends. In a letter, written\nin December, 1835, she says: \"It is certainly true that Louis-Philippe\nis the enemy of humanity. . . .\" Nothing less than that! A little later,\nthe enemy of humanity invites the young friends of his son Montpensier\nto his _chateau_ for the carnival holiday. Maurice is allowed to\naccept the invitation, as he wishes to, but he is to avoid showing\nthat gratitude which destroys independence. \"The entertainments that\nMontpensier offers you are favours,\" writes this mother of the Gracchi\nquite gravely. If he is asked about his opinions, the child is to reply\nthat he is rather too young to have opinions yet, but not too young to\nknow what opinions he will have when he is free to have them. \"You\ncan reply,\" says his mother, \"that you are Republican by race and\nby nature.\" She then adds a few aphorisms. \"Princes are our natural\nenemies,\" she says; and then again: \"However good-hearted the child of\na king may be, he is destined to be a tyrant.\" All this is certainly a\ngreat commotion to make about her little son accepting a glass of fruit\nsyrup and a few cakes at the house of a schoolfellow. But George Sand\nwas then under the domination of \"Robespierre in person.\"\n\nMichel had brought George Sand over to republicanism. Without wishing\nto exaggerate the service he had rendered her by this, it appears to\nme that it certainly was one, if we look at it in one way. Rightly or\nwrongly, George Sand had seen in Michel the man who devotes himself\nentirely to a cause of general interest. She had learnt something in\nhis school, and perhaps all the more thoroughly because it was in his\nschool. She had learnt that love is in any case a selfish passion. She\nhad learnt that another object must be given to the forces of sympathy\nof a generous heart, and that such an object may be the service of\nhumanity, devotion to an idea.\n\nThis was a turn in the road, and led the writer on to leave the personal\nstyle for the impersonal style.\n\nThere was another service, too, which Michel had rendered to George\nSand. He had pleaded for her in her petition for separation from her\nhusband, and she had won her case.\n\nEver since George Sand had taken back her independence in 1831, her\nintercourse with Dudevant had not been disagreeable. She and her husband\nexchanged cordial letters. When he came to Paris, he made no attempt to\nstay with his wife, lest he should inconvenience her. \"I shall put up\nat Hippolyte's,\" he says in his letter to her. \"I do not want to\ninconvenience you in the least, nor to be inconvenienced myself, which\nis quite natural.\" He certainly was a most discreet husband. When\nshe started for Italy, he begs her to take advantage of so good an\nopportunity for seeing such a beautiful country. He was also a husband\nready to give good advice. Later on, he invited Pagello to spend a\nlittle time at Nohant. This was certainly the climax in this strange\nstory.\n\nDuring the months, though, that the husband and wife were together,\nagain at Nohant, the scenes began once more. Dudevant's irritability was\nincreased by the fact that he was always short of money, and that he was\naware of his own deplorable shortcomings as a financial administrator.\nHe had made speculations which had been disastrous. He was very\ncredulous, as so many suspicious people are, and he had been duped by\na swindler in an affair of maritime armaments. He had had all the more\nfaith in this enterprise because a picture of the boat had been shown\nhim on paper. He had spent ninety thousand francs of the hundred\nthousand he had had, and was now living on his wife's income. Something\nhad to be decided upon. George Sand paid his debts first, and the\nhusband and wife then signed an agreement to the effect that their\nrespective property should be separated. Dudevant regretted having\nsigned this afterwards, and it was torn up after a violent scene which\ntook place before witnesses in October, 1835. The pretext of this scene\nhad been an order given to Maurice. In a series of letters, which have\nnever hitherto been published, George Sand relates the various incidents\nof this affair. We give some of the more important passages. The\nfollowing letter is to her half-brother Hippolyte, who used to be\nCasimir's drinking companion.\n\n\n_\"To Hippolyte Chatiron._\n\n\"My friend, I am about to tell you some news which will reach you\nindirectly, and that you had better hear first from me. Instead of\ncarrying out our agreement pleasantly and loyally, Casimir is acting\nwith the most insane animosity towards me. Without my giving him any\nreason for such a thing, either by my conduct or my manner of treating\nhim, he endeavoured to strike me. He was prevented by five persons, one\nof whom was Dutheil, and he then fetched his gun to shoot me. As you can\nimagine, he was not allowed to do this.\n\n\"On account of such treatment and of his hatred, which amounts to\nmadness, there is no safety for me in a house to which he always has the\nright to come. I have no guarantee, except his own will and pleasure,\nthat he will keep our agreement, and I cannot remain at the mercy of a\nman who behaves so unreasonably and indelicately to me. I have therefore\ndecided to ask for a legal separation, and I shall no doubt obtain this.\nCasimir made this frightful scene the evening before leaving for\nParis. On his return here, he found the house empty, and me staying at\nDutheil's, by permission of the President of La Chatre. He also found a\nsummons awaiting him on the mantelshelf. He had to make the best of it,\nfor he knew it was no use attempting to fight against the result of his\nown folly, and that, by holding out, the scandal would all fall on him.\nHe made the following stipulations, promising to adhere to them. Duthell\nwas our intermediary. I am to allow him a pension of 3,800 francs,\nwhich, with the 1,200 francs income that he now has, will make 5,000\nfrancs a year for him. I think this is all straightforward, as I am\npaying for the education of the two children. My daughter will remain\nunder my guidance, as I understand. My son will remain at the college\nwhere he now is until he has finished his education. During the holidays\nhe will spend a month with his father and a month with me. In this\nway, there will be no contest. Dudevant will return to Paris very\nsoon, without making any opposition, and the Court will pronounce the\nseparation in default.\"(23)\n\n     (23) Communicated by M. S. Rocheblave.\n\n\nThe following amusing letter on the same subject was written by George\nSand to Adolphe Duplomb in the _patois_ peculiar to Berry:\n\n\"DEAR HYDROGEN,\n\n\"You have been misinformed about what took place at La Chatre. Duthell\nnever quarrelled with the Baron of Nohant-Vic. This is the true story.\nThe baron took it into his head to strike me. Dutheil objected. Fleury\nand Papet also objected. The baron went to search for his gun to kill\nevery one. Every one did not want to be killed, and so the baron said:\n'Well, that's enough then,' and began to drink again. That was how it\nall happened. No one quarrelled with him. But I had had enough. As I do\nnot care to earn my living and then leave _my substance_ in the hands of\nthe _diable_ and be bowed out of the house every year, while the village\nhussies sleep in my beds and bring their fleas into my house, I just\nsaid: 'I ain't going to have any more of that,' and I went and found the\nbig judge of La Chatre, and I says, says I: 'That's how it is.' And\nthen he says, says he: 'All right.' And so he unmarried us. And I am not\nsorry. They say that the baron will make an appeal. I ain't knowin'.\nWe shall see. If he does, he'll lose everything. And that's the whole\nstory.\"(24)\n\n     (24) Communicated by M. Charles Duplomb.\n\nThe case was pleaded in March, 1836, at La Chatre, and in July at\nBourges. The Court granted the separation, and the care of the children\nwas attributed to George Sand.\n\nThis was not the end of the affair, though. In September, 1837, George\nSand was warned that Dudevant intended to get Maurice away from her. She\nsent a friend on whom she could count to take her boy to Fontainebleau,\nand then went herself to watch over him. In the mean time, Dudevant, not\nfinding his son at Nohant, took Solange away with him, in spite of the\nchild's tears and the resistance of the governess. George Sand gave\nnotice to the police, and, on discovering that her little daughter was\nsequestered at Guillery, near Nerac, she went herself in a post-chaise\nto the sub-prefect, a charming young man, who was no other than\nBaron Haussmann. On hearing the story, he went himself with her, and,\naccompanied by the lieutenant of the constabulary and the sheriff's\nofficer on horseback, laid siege to the house at Guillery in which the\nyoung girl was imprisoned. Dudevant brought his daughter to the door\nand handed her over to her mother, threatening at the same time to take\nMaurice from her by legal authority. The husband and wife then separated\n. . . delighted with each other, according to George Sand. They very\nrarely met after this affair. Dudevant certainly did not impress people\nvery favourably. After the separation, when matters were being\nfinally settled, he put in a claim for fifteen pots of jam and an iron\nfrying-pan. All this seems very petty.\n\nThe first use George Sand made of the liberty granted to her by the law,\nin 1836, was to start off with Maurice and Solange for Switzerland to\njoin her friends Franz Liszt and the Comtesse d'Agoult. George Sand had\nmade Liszt's acquaintance through Musset. Liszt gave music-lessons to\nAlfred's sister, Herminie. He was born in 1811, so that he was seven\nyears younger than George Sand. He was twenty-three at the time he first\nmet her, and their friendship was always platonic. They had remarkable\naffinities of nature. Liszt had first thought of becoming a priest.\nHis religious fervour was gradually transformed into an ardent love\nof humanity. His early education had been neglected, and he now read\neagerly. He once asked Monsieur Cremieux, the advocate, to teach him\n\"the whole of French literature.\" On relating this to some one, Cremieux\nremarked: \"Great confusion seems to reign in this young man's mind.\" He\nhad been wildly excited during the movement of 1830, greatly influenced\nby the Saint-Simon ideas, and was roused to enthusiasm by Lamennals,\nwho had just published the _Paroles d'un Croyant_. After reading\nLeone Leoni, he became an admirer of George Sand. Leone Leoni is a\ntransposition of Manon Lescaut into the romantic style. A young girl\nnamed Juliette has been seduced by a young seigneur, and then discovers\nthat this man is an abominable swindler. If we try to imagine all the\ninfamous things of which an _apache_ would be capable, who at the same\ntime is devoted to the women of the pavement, we then have Leone Leoni.\nJuliette, who is naturally honest and straightforward, has a horror of\nall the atrocities and shameful things she sees. And yet, in spite of\nall, she comes back to Leone Leoni, and cannot love any one else. Her\nlove is stronger than she is, and her passion sweeps away all scruples\nand triumphs over all scruples. The difference between the novel of the\neighteenth century, which was so true to life, and this lyrical fantasy\nof the nineteenth century is very evident. Manon and Des Grieux always\nremained united to each other, for they were of equal value. Everything\ntook place in the lower depths of society, and in the mire, as it were,\nof the heart. You have only to make a good man of Des Grieux, or a\nvirtuous girl of Manon, and it is all over. The transposing of Leone\nLeoni is just this, and the romanticism of it delighted Liszt.\n\nHe had just given a fine example of applying romanticism to life. Marie\nd'Agoult, _nee_ de Flavigny, had decided, one fine day, to leave her\nhusband and daughter for the sake of the passion that was everything to\nher. She accordingly started for Geneva, and Liszt joined her there.\n\nBetween these two women a friendship sprang up, which was due rather\nto a wish to like each other than to a real attraction or real\nfellow-feeling. The Comtesse d'Agoult, with her blue eyes, her\nslender figure, and somewhat ethereal style, was a veritable Diana, an\naristocrat and a society woman. George Sand was her exact opposite. But\nthe Comtesse d'Agoult had just \"sacrificed all the vanities of the world\nfor the sake of an artist,\" so that she deserved consideration. The\nstay at Geneva was gay and animated. The _Piffoels_ (George Sand and her\nchildren) and the _Fellows_ (Liszt and his pupil, Hermann Cohen) enjoyed\nscandalizing the whole hotel by their Bohemian ways. They went for an\nexcursion to the frozen lake. At Lausanne Liszt played the organ. On\nreturning to Paris the friends did not want to separate. In October,\n1836, George Sand took up her abode on the first floor of the Hotel de\nFrance, in the Rue Laffitte, and Liszt and the Corntesse d'Agoult took\na room on the floor above. The trio shared, a drawing-room between\nthem, but in reality it became more the Comtesse d'Agoult's _salon_ than\nGeorge Sand's. Lamennais, Henri Heine, Mickiewicz, Michel of Bourges\nand Charles Didier were among their visitors, and we are told that this\n_salon_, improvised in a hotel was \"a reunion of the _elite_, over which\nthe Comtesse d'Agoult presided with exquisite grace.\" She was a true\nsociety woman, a veritable mistress of her home, one of those who could\ntransform a room in a hotel, a travelling carriage, or even a prison\ninto that exquisite thing, so dear to French polite society of yore--a\n_salon_.\n\nAmong the _habitues_ of Madame d'Agoult's _salon_ was Chopin. This is\na new chapter in George Sand's life, and a little later on we shall be\nable to consider, as a whole, the importance of this intercourse with\ngreat artists as regards her intellectual development.\n\nBefore finishing our study of this epoch in her life, we must notice how\nmuch George Sand's talent had developed and blossomed out. _Mauprat_ was\npublished in 1837, and is undoubtedly the first of her _chefs-d'oeuvre_.\nIn her uninterrupted literary production, which continued regularly in\nspite of and through all the storms of her private life, there is much\nthat is strange and second-rate and much that is excellent. _Jacques_\nis an extraordinary piece of work. It was written at Venice when she was\nwith Pagello. George Sand declared that she had neither put herself nor\nMusset into this book. She was nevertheless inspired by their case,\nand she merely transposed their ideal of renunciation. _Andre_ may be\nclassed among the second-rate work. It is the story of a young noble who\nseduces a girl of the working-class. It is a souvenir of Berry, written\nin a home-sick mood when George Sand was at Venice. _Simon_ also belongs\nto the second-rate category. The portrait of Michel of Bourges can\neasily be traced in it. George Sand had intended doing more for Michel\nthan this. She composed a revolutionary novel in three volumes, in his\nhonour, entitled: _Engelwald with the high forehead_. Buloz neither\ncared for _Engelwald_ nor for his high forehead, and this novel was\nnever published.\n\nAccording to George Sand, when she wrote _Mauprat_ her idea was\nthe rehabilitation of marriage. \"I had just been petitioning for a\nseparation,\" she says. \"I had, until then, been fighting against the\nabuses of marriage, and, as I had never developed my ideas sufficiently,\nI had given every one the notion that I despised the essential\nprinciples of it. On the contrary, marriage really appeared to me in all\nthe moral beauty of those principles, and in my book I make my hero, at\nthe age of eighty, proclaim his faithfulness to the only woman he has\never loved.\"\n\n\"She is the only woman I have ever loved,\" says Bernard de Mauprat. \"No\nother woman has ever attracted my attention or been embraced by me. I am\nlike that. When I love, I love for ever, in the past, in the present and\nin the future.\"\n\n_Mauprat_, then, according to George Sand, was a novel with a purpose,\njust as _Indiana_ was, although they each had an opposite purpose.\nFortunately it is nothing of the kind. This is one of those explanations\narranged afterwards, peculiar sometimes to authors. The reality about\nall this is quite different.\n\nIn this book George Sand had just given the reins to her imagination,\nwithout allowing sociological preoccupations to spoil everything. During\nher excursions in Berry, she had stopped to gaze at the ruins of an old\nfeudal castle. We all know the power of suggestion contained in those\nold stones, and how wonderfully they tell stories of the past they\nhave witnessed to those persons who know how to question them. The\nremembrance of the _chateau_ of Roche Mauprat came to the mind of the\nnovelist. She saw it just as it stood before the Revolution, a fortress,\nand at the same time a refuge for the wild lord and his eight sons,\nwho used to sally forth and ravage the country. In French narrative\nliterature there is nothing to surpass the first hundred pages in which\nGeorge Sand introduces us to the burgraves of central France. She is\njust as happy when she takes us to Paris with Bernard de Mauprat, to\nParis of the last days of the old _regime_. She introduces us to the\nsociety which she had learnt to know through the traditions of her\ngrandmother. It is not only Nature, but history, which she uses as a\nsetting for her story. How cleverly, too, she treats the analysis which\nis the true subject of the book, that of education through love. We see\nthe untamed nature of Bernard de Mauprat gradually giving way under the\ninfluence of the noble and delicious Edmee.\n\nThere are typical peasants, too, in _Mauprat_. We have Marcasse, the\nmole-catcher, and Patience, the good-natured Patience, the rustic\nphilosopher, well up in Epictetus and in Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who has\ngone into the woods to live his life according to the laws of Nature and\nto find the wisdom of the primitive days of the world. We are told that,\nduring the Revolution, Patience was a sort of intermediary between the\n_chateau_ and the cottage, and that he helped in bringing about the\nreign of equity in his district. It is to be hoped this was so.\n\nIn any case, it is very certain that we come across this Patience again\nin Russian novels with a name ending in _ow_ or _ew_. This is a proof\nthat if the personage seems somewhat impossible, he was at any rate\noriginal, new and entertaining.\n\nWe hear people say that George Sand is no longer read. It is to be hoped\nthat _Mauprat_ is still read, otherwise our modern readers miss one of\nthe finest stories in the history of novels. This, then, is the point\nat which we have arrived in the evolution of George Sand's genius. There\nmay still be modifications in her style, and her talent may still be\nrefreshed under various influences, but with _Mauprat_ she took her\nplace in the first rank of great storytellers.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nA CASE OF MATERNAL AFFECTION IN LOVE\n\nCHOPIN\n\n\nWe have passed over George Sand's intercourse with Liszt and Madame\nd'Agoult very rapidly. One of Balzac's novels gives us an opportunity of\nsaying a few more words about it.\n\nBalzac had been introduced to George Sand by Jules Sandeau. At the time\nof her rupture with his friend, Balzac had sided entirely with him. In\nthe _Lettres a l'Etrangere_, we see the author of the _Comedie humaine_\npouring out his indignation with the blue stocking, who was so cruel in\nher love, in terms which were not extremely elegant. Gradually, and when\nhe knew more about the adventure, his anger cooled down. In March, 1838,\nhe gave Madame Zulma Carraud an account of a visit to Nohant. He found\nhis comrade, George Sand, in her dressing-gown, smoking a cigar by her\nfireside after dinner.\n\n\"She had some pretty yellow slippers on, ornamented with fringe,\nsome fancy stockings and red trousers. So much for the moral side.\nPhysically, she had doubled her chin like a canoness. She had not a\nsingle white hair, in spite of all her fearful misfortunes; her dusky\ncomplexion had not changed. Her beautiful eyes were just as bright, and\nshe looked just as stupid as ever when she was thinking. . . .\"\n\nThis is George Sand in her thirty-fifth year, as she was at the time of\nthe fresh adventure we are about to relate.\n\nBalzac continues by giving us a few details about the life of the\nauthoress. It was very much like his own, except that Balzac went to bed\nat six o'clock and got up at midnight, and George Sand went to bed at\nsix in the morning and got up at noon. He adds the following remark,\nwhich shows us the state of her feelings:\n\n\"She is now in a very quiet retreat, and condemns both marriage and\nlove, because she has had nothing but disappointment in both herself.\nHer man was a rare one, that was really all.\"\n\n\nIn the course of their friendly conversation, George Sand gave him the\nsubject for a novel which it would be rather awkward for her to\nwrite. The novel was to be _Galeriens_ or _Amours forces_. These\n\"galley-slaves\" of love were Liszt and the Comtesse d'Agoult, who had\nbeen with George Sand at Chamonix, Paris and Nohant. It was very evident\nthat she could not write the novel herself.\n\nBalzac accordingly wrote it, and it figures in the _Comedie humaine as\nBeatrix_. Beatrix is the Comtesse d'Agoult, the inspirer, and Liszt is\nthe composer Conti.\n\n\"You have no idea yet of the awful rights that a love which no longer\nexists gives to a man over a woman. The convict is always under the\ndomination of the companion chained to him. I am lost, and must return\nto the convict prison,\" writes Balzac in this book. Then, too, there is\nno mistaking his portrait of Beatrix. The fair hair that seems to give\nlight, the forehead which looks transparent, the sweet, charming face,\nthe long, wonderfully shaped neck, and, above and beyond all, that air\nof a princess, in all this we can easily recognize \"the fair, blue-eyed\nPeri.\" Not content with bringing this illustrious couple into his novel,\nBalzac introduces other contemporaries. Claude Vignon (who, although\nhis special work was criticism, made a certain place for himself in\nliterature) and George Sand herself appear in this book. She is Felicite\ndes Touches, and her pen name is Camille Maupin. \"Camille is an artist,\"\nwe are told; \"she has genius, and she leads an exceptional life such as\ncould not be judged in the same way as an ordinary existence.\" Some one\nasks how she writes her books, and the answer is: \"Just in the same way\nas you do your woman's work, your netting or your tapestry.\" She is said\nto have the intelligence of an angel and even more heart than talent.\nWith her fixed, set gaze, her dark complexion and her masculine ways,\nshe is the exact antithesis of the fair Beatrix. She is constantly being\ncompared to the latter, and is evidently preferred to her. It is very\nevident from whom Balzac gets his information, and it is also evident\nthat the friendship between the two women has cooled down.\n\nThe cause of the coolness between them was George Sand's infatuation\nfor Chopin, whom she had known through Liszt and Madame d'Agoult. George\nSand wrote to Liszt from Nohant, in March, 1837: \"Tell Chopin that I\nhope he will come with you. Marie cannot live without him, and I adore\nhim.\" In April she wrote to Madame d'Agoult: \"Tell Chopin that I idolize\nhim.\" We do not know whether Madame d'Agoult gave the message, but\nshe certainly replied: \"Chopin coughs with infinite grace. He is an\nirresolute man. The only thing about him that is permanent is his\ncough.\" This is certainly very feminine in its ferociousness.\n\nAt the time when he came into George Sand's life, Chopin, the composer\nand virtuoso, was the favourite of Parisian _salons_, the pianist in\nvogue. He was born in 1810, so that he was then twenty-seven years\nof age. His success was due, in the first place, to his merits as\nan artist, and nowhere is an artist's success so great as in Paris.\nChopin's delicate style was admirably suited to the dimensions and to\nthe atmosphere of a _salon_.(25)\n\n     (25) As regards Chopin, I have consulted a biography by\n     Liszt, a study by M. Camille Bellaigue and the volume by M.\n     Elie Poiree in the _Collection des musiciens celebres_,\n     published by H. Laurens.\n\nHe confessed to Liszt that a crowd intimidated him, that he felt\nsuffocated by all the quick breathing and paralyzed by the inquisitive\neyes turned on him. \"You were intended for all this,\" he adds, \"as, if\nyou do not win over your public, you can at least overwhelm it.\"\n\nChopin was made much of then in society. He was fragile and delicate,\nand had always been watched over and cared for. He had grown up in a\npeaceful, united family, in one of those simple homes in which all\nthe details of everyday life become less prosaic, thanks to an innate\ndistinction of sentiment and to religious habits. Prince Radziwill had\nwatched over Chopin's education. He had been received when quite young\nin the most aristocratic circles, and \"the most celebrated beauties had\nsmiled on him as a youth.\" Social life, then, and feminine influence had\nthus helped to make him ultra refined. It was very evident to every one\nwho met him that he was a well-bred man, and this is quickly observed,\neven with pianists. On arriving he made a good impression, he was well\ndressed, his white gloves were immaculate. He was reserved and somewhat\nlanguid. Every one knew that he was delicate, and there was a rumour\nof an unhappy love affair. It was said that he had been in love with a\ngirl, and that her family had refused to consent to her marriage with\nhim. People said he was like his own music, the dreamy, melancholy\nthemes seemed to accord so well with the pale young face of the\ncomposer. The fascination of the languor which seemed to emanate from\nthe man and from his work worked its way, in a subtle manner, into the\nhearts of his hearers. Chopin did not care to know Lelia. He did not\nlike women writers, and he was rather alarmed at this one. It was Liszt\nwho introduced them. In his biography of Chopin, he tells us that the\nextremely sensitive artist, who was so easily alarmed, dreaded \"this\nwoman above all women, as, like a priestess of Delphi, she said so many\nthings that the others could not have said. He avoided her and postponed\nthe introduction. Madame Sand had no idea that she was feared as a\nsylph. . . .\" She made the first advances. It is easy to see what\ncharmed her in him. In the first place, he appealed to her as he did to\nall women, and then, too, there was the absolute contrast of their two\nopposite natures. She was all force, of an expansive, exuberant nature.\nHe was very discreet, reserved and mysterious. It seems that the Polish\ncharacteristic is to lend oneself, but never to give oneself away, and\none of Chopin's friends said of him that he was \"more Polish than Poland\nitself.\" Such a contrast may prove a strong attraction, and then, too,\nGeorge Sand was very sensitive to the charm of music. But what she saw\nabove all in Chopin was the typical artist, just as she understood the\nartist, a dreamer, lost in the clouds, incapable of any activity that\nwas practical, a \"lover of the impossible.\" And then, too, he was ill.\nWhen Musset left Venice, after all the atrocious nights she had spent at\nhis bedside, she wrote: \"Whom shall I have now to look after and tend?\"\nIn Chopin she found some one to tend.\n\nAbout this time, she was anxious about the health of her son Maurice,\nand she thought she would take her family to Majorca. This was a\nlamentable excursion, but it seemed satisfactory at first. They\ntravelled by way of Lyons, Avignon, Vaucluse and Nimes. At Perpignan,\nChopin arrived, \"as fresh as a rose.\" \"Our journey,\" wrote George Sand,\n\"seems to be under the most favourable conditions.\" They then went on\nto Barcelona and to Palma. In November, 1838, George Sand wrote a most\nenthusiastic letter: \"It is poetry, solitude, all that is most\nartistic and _chique_ on earth. And what skies, what a country; we are\ndelighted.\"(26) The disenchantment was soon to begin, though. The first\ndifficulty was to find lodgings, and the second to get furniture. There\nwas no wood to burn and there was no linen to be had. It took two months\nto have a pair of tongs made, and it cost twenty-eight pounds at the\ncustoms for a piano to enter the country. With great difficulty, the\nforlorn travellers found a country-house belonging to a man named Gomez,\nwhich they were able to rent. It was called the \"Windy House.\" The wind\ndid not inconvenience them like the rain, which now commenced. Chopin\ncould not endure the heat and the odour of the fires. His disease\nincreased, and this was the origin of the great tribulations that were\nto follow.\n\n     Buloz:\n\n     _Monday 13th._\n\n     MY DEAR CHRISTINE,\n\n     \"I have only been at Palma four days.  My journey has been\n     very satisfactory, but rather long and difficult until we\n     were out of France.  I took up my pen (as people say) twenty\n     times over to write the last five or six pages for which\n     _Spiridion_ has been waiting for six months.  It is not the\n     easiest thing in the world, I can assure you, to give the\n     conclusion of one's own religious belief, and when\n     travelling it is impossible.  At twenty different places I\n     have resolved to think it solemnly over and to write down my\n     conclusion. But these stoppages were the most tiring part of\n     our journey. There were visits, dinners, walks, curiosities,\n     ruins, the Vaucluse fountain, Reboul and the Nimes arena,\n     the Barcelona cathedrals, dinners on board the war-ships,\n     the Italian theatres of Spain (and what theatres and what\n     Italians!), guitars and Heaven knows what beside.  There was\n     the moonlight on the sea and above all Valma and Mallorca,\n     the most delightful place in the world, and all this kept me\n     terribly far away from philosophy and theology. Fortunately\n     I have found some superb convents here all in ruins, with\n     palm-trees, aloes and the cactus in the midst of broken\n     mosaics and crumbling cloisters, and this takes me back to\n     _Spiridion_. For the last three days I have had a rage for\n     work, which I cannot satisfy yet, as we have neither fire\n     nor lodging.  There is not an inn in Palma, no house to let\n     and no furniture to be bought. On arriving here people first\n     have to buy some ground, then build, and afterwards send for\n     furniture.  After this, permission to live somewhere has to\n     be obtained from Government, and after five or six years one\n     can think about opening one's trunk and changing one's\n     chemise, whilst waiting for permission from the Customs to\n     have some shoes and handkerchiefs passed.  For the last four\n     days then we have spent our time going from door to door, as\n     we do not want to sleep in the open air.  We hope now to be\n     settled in about three days, as a miracle has taken place.\n     For the first time in the memory of man, there is a\n     furnished house to let in Mallorca, a charming country-house\n     in a delightful desert. . . .\"\n\nAt that time Spain was the very last country in which to travel with a\nconsumptive patient. In a very fine lecture, the subject of which was\n_The Fight with Tuberculosis_,(27) Dr. Landouzy proves to us that ever\nsince the sixteenth century, in the districts of the Mediterranean,\nin Spain, in the Balearic Isles and throughout the kingdom of Naples,\ntuberculosis was held to be contagious, whilst the rest of Europe was\nignorant of this contagion. Extremely severe rules had been laid down\nwith regard to the measures to be taken for avoiding the spread of\nthis disease. A consumptive patient was considered as a kind of\nplague-stricken individual. Chateaubriand had experienced the\ninconveniences of this scare during his stay in Rome with Madame de\nBeaumont, who died there of consumption, at the beginning of the winter\nof 1803. George Sand, in her turn, was to have a similar experience.\nWhen Chopin was convicted of consumption, \"which,\" as she writes, \"was\nequivalent to the plague, according to the Spanish doctors, with their\nforegone conclusions about contagion,\" their landlord simply turned\nthem out of his house. They took refuge in the Chartreuse monastery of\nValdemosa, where they lived in a cell. The site was very beautiful. By a\nwooded slope a terrace could be reached, from which there was a view of\nthe sea on two sides.\n\n     (27) L. Landouzy of the Academy of Medecine, _La Lutte\n     contre la tuberculose_, published by L. Maretheux.\n\n\"We are planted between heaven and earth,\" wrote George Sand. \"The\nclouds cross our garden at their own will and pleasure, and the eagles\nclamour over our heads.\"\n\nA cell in this monastery was composed of three rooms: the one in the\nmiddle was intended for reading, prayer and meditation, the other\ntwo were the bedroom and the workshop. All three rooms looked on to a\ngarden. Reading, rest and manual labour made up the life of these men.\nThey lived in a limited space certainly, but the view stretched out\ninfinitely, and prayer went up direct to God. Among the ruined buildings\nof the enormous monastery there was a cloister still standing, through\nwhich the wind howled desperately. It was like the scenery in the nuns'\nact in _Robert le Diable_. All this made the old monastery the most\nromantic place in the world.(28)\n\n     (28) George Sand to Madame Buloz.  Postscript to the letter\n     already quoted:\n\n     \"I am leaving for the country where I have a furnished house\n     with a garden, magnificently situated for 50 francs a month.\n     I have also taken a cell, that is three rooms and a garden\n     for 35 francs a year in the Chartreuse of Valdemosa, a\n     magnificent, immense monastery quite lonely in the midst of\n     mountains. Our garden is full of oranges and lemons.  The\n     trees break under them.  We have hedges of cactus twenty to\n     thirty feet high, the sea is about a mile and a half away.\n     We have a donkey to take us to the town, roads inaccessible\n     to visitors, immense cloisters and the most beautiful\n     architecture, a charming church, a cemetery with a palm-tree\n     and a stone cross like the one in the third act of _Robert\n     le Diable_.  Then, too, there are beds of shrubs cut in\n     form.  All this we have to ourselves with an old woman to\n     wait on us, and the sacristan who is warder, steward,\n     majordomo and Jack-of-all-trades. I hope we shall have\n     ghosts.  The door of my cell leads into an enormous\n     cloister, and when the wind slams the door it is like a\n     cannon going off through all the monastery. I am delighted\n     with everything, and fancy I shall be more often in the cell\n     than in the country-house, which is about six miles away.\n     You see that I have plenty of poetry and solitude, so that\n     if I do not work I shall be a stupid thing.\"\n\nThe only drawback was that it was most difficult to live there. There\nwas no way of getting warm. The stove was a kind of iron furnace which\ngave out a terrible odour, and did not prevent the rooms from being so\ndamp that clothes mildewed while they were being worn. There was no way\nof getting proper food either. They had to eat the most indigestible\nthings. There were five sorts of meat certainly, but these were pig,\npork, bacon, ham and pickled pork. This was all cooked in dripping,\npork-dripping, of course, or in rancid oil. Still more than this, the\nnatives refused, not only to serve the unfortunate travellers, but\nto sell them the actual necessaries of life. The fact was, they had\nscandalized the Majorcan people. All Majorca was indignant because\nSolange, who at that time was nine years old, roamed about the mountains\n_disguised as a man_. Added to this, when the horn sounded which called\npeople to their devotions in the churches, these strange inhabitants\nof the old Valdemosa monastery never took any more notice than pagans.\nPeople kept clear of them. Chopin suffered with the cold, the cooking\nmade him sick, and he used to have fits of terror in the cloisters. They\nhad to leave hastily. The only steamboat from the island was used to\ntransport the pigs which are the pride and wealth of Majorca. People\nwere only taken as an extra. It was, therefore, in the company of these\nsquealing, ill-smelling creatures that the invalid crossed the water.\nWhen he arrived at Barcelona, he looked like a spectre and was spitting\nblood. George Sand was quite right in saying that this journey was an\n\"awful fiasco.\"\n\nArt and literature did not gain much either by this expedition. George\nSand finished her novel entitled _Spiridion_ at Valdemosa. She had\ncommenced it before starting for Spain. In a volume on _Un hiver a\nMajorque_ she gave some fine descriptions, and also a harsh accusation\nof the monks, whom she held responsible for all the mishaps of the\nSand caravan. She considered that the Majorcans had been brutalized and\nfanaticized, thanks to their influence. As to Chopin, he was scarcely in\na state to derive any benefit from such a journey, and he certainly did\nnot get any. He did not thoroughly appreciate the beauties of nature,\nparticularly of Majorcan nature. In a letter to one of his friends he\ngives the following description of their habitation:--\n\n\"Between rocks and sea, in a great deserted monastery, in a cell, the\ndoors of which are bigger than the carriage entrances to the houses in\nParis, you can imagine me, without white gloves, and no curl in my hair,\nas pale as usual. My cell is the shape of a large-sized bier. . . .\"\n\nThis certainly does not sound very enthusiastic. The question is whether\nhe composed anything at all at Valdemosa. Liszt presents him to\nus improvising his Prelude in B flat minor under the most dramatic\ncircumstances. We are told that one day, when George Sand and her\nchildren had started on an excursion, they were surprised by a\nthunderstorm. Chopin had stayed at home in the monastery, and, terrified\nat the danger he foresaw for them, he fainted. Before they reached home\nhe had improvised his _Prelude_, in which he has put all his terror and\nthe nervousness due to his disease. It appears, though, that all this is\na legend, and that there is not a single echo of the stay at Valdemosa\nin Chopin's work.\n\nThe deplorable journey to Majorca dates from November, 1838 to March,\n1839. The intimacy between George Sand and Chopin continued eight years\nmore.\n\nIn the summer Chopin stayed it Nohant. Eugene Delacroix, who was paying\na visit there too, describes his presence as follows: \"At times, through\nthe window opening on to the garden, we get wafts of Chopin's music, as\nhe too is at work. It is mingled with the songs of the nightingales and\nwith the perfume of the rose trees.\"\n\nChopin did not care much for Nohant. In the first place, he only liked\nthe country for about a fortnight at a time, which is very much like\nnot caring for it at all. Then what made him detest the country were the\ninhabitants. Hippolyte Chatiron was terrible after he had been drinking.\nHe was extremely effusive and cordial.\n\nIn the winter they first lived in the Rue Pigalle. George Sand used to\nreceive Pierre Leroux, Louis Blanc, Edgar Quinet, Etienne Arago, and\nmany other men. Chopin, who was not very intellectual, felt ill at\nease amongst all these literary men, these reformers, arguers and\nspeechifiers. In 1842, they emigrated to the Square d'Orleans. There\nwas a sort of little colony established there, consisting of Alexandre\nDumas, Dantan the caricaturist, the Viardots, Zimmermann, and the wife\nof the Spanish consul, Madame Marliani, who had attracted them all\nthere. They took their meals together. It was a regular phalinstery, and\nChopin had very elegant tastes!\n\nWe must give George Sand credit for looking after him with admirable\ndevotion. She certainly went on nursing her \"invalid,\" or her \"dear\nskeleton,\" as she called him, but her infatuation had been over for a\nlong time. The absolute contrast of two natures may be attractive at\nfirst, but the attraction does not last, and, when the first enthusiasm\nis over, the logical consequence is that they become disunited. This was\nwhat Liszt said in rather an odd but energetic way. He points out all\nthat there was \"intolerably incompatible, diametrically opposite and\nsecretly antipathetic between two natures which seemed to have been\nmutually drawn to each other by a sudden and superficial attraction,\nfor the sake of repulsing each other later on with all the force of\ninexpressible sorrow and boredom.\" Illness had embittered Chopin's\ncharacter. George Sand used to say that \"when he was angry he was\nterrifying.\" He was very intelligent, too, and delighted in quizzing\npeople for whom he did not care. Solange and Maurice were now older, and\nthis made the situation somewhat delicate. Chopin, too, had a mania\nfor meddling with family matters. He quarrelled one day with Maurice.\nAnother day George Sand was annoyed with her son-in-law Clesinger and\nwith her daughter Solange, and Chopin took their side. This was the\ncause of their quarrel; it was the last drop that made the cup of\nbitterness overflow.\n\nThe following is a fragment of a letter which George Sand sent to\nGrzymala, in 1847: \"For seven years I have lived with him as a virgin.\nIf any woman on earth could inspire him with absolute confidence, I am\ncertainly that woman, but he has never understood. I know, too, that\nmany people accuse me of having worn him out with my violent sensuality,\nand others accuse me of having driven him to despair by my freaks.\nI believe you know how much truth there is in all this. He himself\ncomplains to me that I am killing him by the privations I insist upon,\nand I feel certain that I should kill him by acting otherwise.\"(29)\n\n     (29) Communicated by M. Rocheblave.\n\nIt has been said that when Chopin was at Nohant he had a village girl\nthere as his mistress. We do not care to discuss the truth of this\nstatement.\n\nIt is interesting to endeavour to characterize the nature of this\nepisode in George Sand's sentimental life. She helps us herself in this.\nAs a romantic writer she neglected nothing which she could turn into\nliterature. She therefore made an analysis of her own case, worked out\nwith the utmost care, and published it in one of her books which is\nlittle read now. The year of the rupture was 1847, and before the\nrupture had really occurred, George Sand brought out a novel entitled\n_Lucrezia Floriani_. In this book she traces the portrait of Chopin\nas Prince Karol. She denied, of course, that it was a portrait, but\ncontemporaries were not to be deceived, and Liszt gives several passages\nfrom _Lucrezia Floriani_ in his biography of the musician. The decisive\nproof was that Chopin recognized himself, and that he was greatly\nannoyed.\n\nAs a matter of fact, there was nothing disagreeable about this portrait.\nThe following fragments are taken from it: \"Gentle, sensitive, exquisite\nin all things, at the age of fifteen he had all the charms of youth,\ntogether with the gravity of a riper age. He remained delicate in body\nind mind. The lack of muscular development caused him to preserve his\nfascinating beauty. . . . He was something like one of those ideal\ncreatures which mediaeval poetry used for the ornamentation of Christian\ntemples. Nothing could have been purer and at the same time more\nenthusiastic than his ideas. . . . He was always lost in his dreams,\nand had no sense of reality. . . .\" His exquisite politeness was then\ndescribed, and the ultra acuteness and nervosity which resulted in that\npower of divination which he possessed. For a portrait to be living,\nit must have some faults as well as qualities. His delineator does\nnot forget to mention the attitude of mystery in which the Prince took\nrefuge whenever his feelings were hurt. She speaks also of his intense\nsusceptibility. \"His wit was very brilliant,\" she says; \"it consisted of\na kind of subtle mocking shrewdness, not really playful, but a sort of\ndelicate, bantering gaiety.\" It may have been to the glory of Prince\nKarol to resemble Chopin, but it was also quite creditable to Chopin\nto have been the model from which this distinguished neurasthenic\nindividual was taken.\n\nPrince Karol meets a certain Lucrezia Floriani, a rich actress and\ncourtesan. She is six years older than he is, somewhat past her prime,\nand now leading a quiet life. She has done with love and love affairs,\nor, at least, she thinks so. \"The fifteen years of passion and torture,\nwhich she had gone through, seemed to her now so cruel that she was\nhoping to have them counted double by the supreme Dispenser of our\ntrials.\" It was, of course, natural that she should acknowledge God's\nshare in the matter. We are told that \"implacable destiny was not\nsatisfied,\" so that when Karol makes his first declaration, Lucrezia\nyields to him, but at the same time she puts a suitable colouring on\nher fall. There are many ways of loving, and it is surely noble and\ndisinterested in a woman to love a man as his mother. \"I shall love\nhim,\" she says, kissing the young Prince's pale face ardently, \"but\nit will be as his mother loved him, just as fervently and just as\nfaithfully. This maternal affection, etc. . . .\" Lucrezia Floriani had\na way of introducing the maternal instinct everywhere. She undertook to\nencircle her children and Prince Karol with the same affection, and her\nnotions of therapeutics were certainly somewhat strange and venturesome,\nfor she fetched her children to the Prince's bedside. \"Karol breathed\nmore freely,\" we are told, \"when the children were there. Their pure\nbreath mingling with their mother's made the air milder and more gentle\nfor his feverish lungs.\" This we shall not attempt to dispute. It is\nthe study of the situation, though, that forms the subject of _Lucrezia\nFloriani_. George Sand gives evidence of wonderful clear-sightedness and\npenetration in the art of knowing herself.\n\nShe gives us warning that it is \"a sad story and sorrowful truth\"\nthat she is telling us. She has herself the better _role_ of the two\nnaturally. It could not have been on that, account that Chopin' was\nannoyed. He was a Pole, and therefore doubly chivalrous, so that such an\nobjection would have been unworthy of a lover. What concerns us is that\nGeorge Sand gives, with great nicety, the exact causes of the rupture.\nIn the first place, Karol was jealous of Lucrezia's stormy past; then\nhis refined nature shrank from certain of her comrades of a rougher\nkind. The invalid was irritated by her robust health, and by the\npresence and, we might almost say, the rivalry of the children. Prince\nKarol finds them nearly always in his way, and he finally takes a\ndislike to them. There comes a moment when Lucrezia sees herself obliged\nto choose between the two kinds of maternity, the natural kind and the\nmaternity according to the convention of lovers.\n\nThe special kind of sentiment, then, between George Sand and Chopin,\nJust as between Lucrezia and Prince Karol, was just this: love with\nmaternal affection. This is extremely difficult to define, as indeed\nis everything which is extremely complex. George Sand declares that her\nreason for not refusing intimacy with Chopin was that she considered\nthis in the light of a duty and as a safeguard. \"One duty more,\" she\nwrites, \"in a life already so full, a life in which I was overwhelmed\nwith fatigue, seemed to me one chance more of arriving at that austerity\ntowards which I felt myself being drawn with a kind of religious\nenthusiasm.\"(30)\n\n     (30) _Histoire de via vie._\n\nWe can only imagine that she was deceiving herself. To accept a lover\nfor the sake of giving up lovers altogether seems a somewhat heroic\nmeans to an end, but also somewhat deceptive. It is certainly true that\nthere was something more in this love than the attraction she felt for\nMusset and for Michel. In the various forms and degrees of our feelings,\nthere is nothing gained by attempting to establish decided divisions\nand absolute demarcations for the sake of classifying them all. Among\nsentiments which are akin, but which our language distinguishes when\ndefining them, there may be some mixture or some confusion with regard\nto their origin. Alfred de Vigny gives us in _Samson_, as the origin of\nlove, even in man, the remembrance of his mother's caresses:\n\n_Il revera toujours a la chaleur du sein._\n\nIt seems, therefore, that we cannot apply the same reasoning, with\nregard to love, when referring to the love of a man or of a woman. With\nthe man there is more pride of possession, and with the woman there\nis more tenderness, more pity, more charity. All this leads us to\nthe conclusion that maternal affection in love is not an unnatural\nsentiment, as has so often been said, or rather a perversion of\nsentiment. It is rather a sentiment in which too much instinct and\nheredity are mingled in a confused way. The object of the education of\nfeeling is to arrive at discerning and eliminating the elements which\ninterfere with the integrity of it. Rousseau called Madame de Warens\nhis mother, but he was a man who was lacking in good taste. George Sand\nfrequently puts into her novels this conception of love which we see her\nput into practice in life. It is impossible when analyzing it closely\nnot to find something confused and disturbing in it which somewhat\noffends us.\n\nIt now remains for us to study what influence George Sand's friendship\nwith some of the greatest artists of her times had on her works. Beside\nLiszt and Chopin, she knew Delacroix, Madame Dorval, Pauline Viardot,\nNourrit and Lablache. Through them she went into artistic circles.\nSome of her novels are stories of the life of artists. _Les Maitres\nMosaistes_ treats of the rivalry between two studios. _La derniere\nAldini_ is the story of a handsome gondolier who, as a tenor, turned the\nheads of patrician women. The first part of _Consuelo_ takes us back to\nthe singing schools and theatres of Venice in the eighteenth century,\nand introduces us to individuals taken from life and cleverly drawn.\nWe have Comte Zustiniani, the dilettante, a wealthy patron of the fine\narts; Porpora, the old master, who looks upon his art as something\nsacred; Corilla, the prima donna, annoyed at seeing a new star appear;\nAnzoleto, the tenor, who is jealous because he gets less applause than\nhis friend; and above and beyond all the others Consuelo, good kind\nConsuelo, the sympathetic singer.\n\nThe theatres of Venice seem to be very much like those of Paris and\nof other places. We have the following sketch of the vanity of the\ncomedian. \"Can a man be jealous of a woman's advantages? Can a lover\ndislike his sweetheart to have success? A man can certainly be jealous\nof a woman's advantages when that man is a vain artist, and a lover\nmay hate his sweetheart to have any success if they both belong to the\ntheatre. A comedian is not a man, Consuelo, but a woman. He lives on his\nsickly vanity; he only thinks of satisfying that vanity, and he works\nfor the sake of intoxicating himself with vanity. A woman's beauty is\napt to take attention from him and a woman's talent may cause his talent\nto be thrown in the background. A woman is his rival, or rather he is\nthe rival of a woman. He has all the little meannesses, the caprices,\nthe exigences and the weak points of a coquette.\" Such is the note of\nthis picture of things and people in the theatrical world. How can we\ndoubt its veracity!\n\nAt any rate, the general idea that George Sand had of the artist was\nexactly the idea adopted by romanticism. We all know what a being\nset apart and free from all social and moral laws, what a \"monster\"\nromanticism made of the artist. It is one of its dogmas that the\nnecessities of art are incompatible with the conditions of a regular\nlife. An artist, for instance, cannot be _bourgeois_, as he is the exact\nopposite. We have Kean's speech in Dumas' drama, entitled _Kean, or\nDisorder and Genius._\n\n\"An actor,\" he says, \"must know all the passions, so that he may express\nthem as he should. I study them in myself.\" And then he adds: \"That is\nwhat you call, orderly! And what is to become of genius while I am being\norderly?\"\n\nAll this is absurd. The artist is not the man who has felt the most, but\nthe man best gifted for imagining the various states of mind and feeling\nand for expressing them. We know, too, that an irregular life is neither\nthe origin nor the stamp of extraordinary intellectual worth. All the\ncripples of Bohemian life prove to us that genius is not the outcome\nof that kind of life, but that, on the contrary, such life is apt to\nparalyze talent. It is very convenient, though, for the artist and for\nevery other variety of \"superior beings\" to make themselves believe that\nordinary morals are not for them. The best argument we can have against\nthis theory is the case of George Sand. The artist, in her case, was\neminently a very regular and hard-working _bourgeois_ woman.\n\n\nThe art in which George Sand gave evidence of the surest taste was\nmusic. That is worthy of notice. In one of her _Lettres d'un voyageur_,\nshe celebrates Liszt attacking the _Dies irae_ on the Fribourg organ.\nShe devotes another letter to the praise of Meyer-beer. She has analyzed\nthe different forms of musical emotion in several of her books. One of\nthe ideas dear to romanticism was that of the union and fusion of all\nthe arts. The writer can, and in a certain way he ought, to produce\nwith words the same effects that the painter does with colours and the\nsculptor with lines. We all know how much literature romantic painters\nand sculptors have put into their art. The romantic writers were less\ninclined to accord the same welcome to music as to the plastic arts.\nTheophile Gautier is said to have exclaimed that music was \"the most\ndisagreeable and the dearest of all the arts.\" Neither Lamartine, Hugo,\nnor any other of the great writers of that period was influenced by\nmusic. Musset was the first one to be impassioned by it, and this may\nhave been as much through his dandyism as from conviction.\n\n     _Fille de la douleur, Harmonie, Harmonie,\n     Langue que fiour l'amour invents le ginie,\n     Qui nous viens d'Italie, et qui lui vins des cieux,\n     Douce langue du coeur, la seule ou la pensee,\n     Cette vierge craintive et d'une ombre ofensie,\n     Passe en gardant son voile et sans craindre les eux,\n     Qui sait ce qu'un enfant peut entendre et peut dire\n     Dans tes soupirs divins nes de l'air qu'il respire,\n     Tristes comme son coeur et doux comme sa voix?_\n\nGeorge Sand, who agreed with Musset, claimed for \"the most beautiful\nof all the arts,\" the honour of being able to paint \"all the shades\nof sentiment and all the phases of passion.\" \"Music,\" she says, \"can\nexpress everything. For describing scenes of nature it has ideal colours\nand lines, neither exact nor yet too minute, but which are all the more\nvaguely and delightfully poetical.\"(31)\n\n     (31) Eleventh _Lettre d'un voyageur_:  To Giacomo Meyerbeer.\n\nAs examples of music in literature we have George Sand's phrase, more\nlyrical and musical than picturesque. We have, too, the gentle, soothing\nstrophes of Sully Prudhomme and the vague melody of the Verlaine songs:\n\"_De la musique avant toute chose_.\" It would be absurd to exaggerate\nthe influence exercised by George Sand, and to attribute to her an\nimportance which does not belong to her, over poetical evolution. It is\nonly fair to say, though, that music, which was looked upon suspiciously\nfor so long a time by classical writers of sane and sure taste, has\ncompletely invaded our present society, so that we are becoming more\nand more imbued with it. George Sand's predilection for modern art is\nanother feature which makes her one of us, showing that her tendencies\nwere very marked for things of the present day.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nTHE HUMANITARIAN DREAM\n\nPIERRE LEROUX--SOCIALISTIC NOVELS\n\n\nHitherto we have seen George Sand put into her work her sufferings,\nher protests as a woman, and her dreams as an artist. But the\nnineteenth-century writer did not confine his ambitions to this modest\ntask. He belonged to a corporation which counted among its members\nVoltaire and Rousseau. The eighteenth-century philosophers had changed\nthe object of literature. Instead of an instrument of analysis, they\nhad made of it a weapon for combat, an incomparable weapon for attacking\ninstitutions and for overthrowing governments. The fact is, that from\nthe time of the Restoration we shall scarcely meet with a single writer,\nfrom the philosopher to the vaudevillist, and from the professor to the\nsong-maker, who did not wish to act as a torch on the path of humanity.\nPoets make revolutions, and show Plato how wrong he was in driving them\naway from his Republic. Sophocles was appointed a general at Athens for\nhaving written a good tragedy, and so novelists, dramatists, critics and\nmakers of puns devoted themselves to making laws. George Sand was too\nmuch a woman of her times to keep aloof from such a movement. We shall\nnow have to study her in her socialistic _role_.\n\nWe can easily imagine on what side her sympathies were. She had always\nbeen battling with institutions, and it seemed to her that institutions\nwere undoubtedly in the wrong. She had proved that there was a great\ndeal of suffering in the world, and as human nature is good at bottom,\nshe decided that society was all wrong. She was a novelist, and she\ntherefore considered that the most satisfactory solutions are those in\nwhich imagination and feeling play a great part. She also considered\nthat the best politics are those which are the most like a novel. We\nmust now follow her, step by step, along the various roads leading to\nUtopia. The truth is, that in that great manufactory of systems and that\nstorehouse of panaceas which the France of Louis-Philippe had become,\nthe only difficulty was to choose between them all.\n\nThe first, in date, of the new gospels was that of the Saint-Simonians.\nWhen George Sand arrived in Paris, Saint-Simonism was one of the\ncuriosities offered to astonished provincials. It was a parody of\nreligion, but it was organized in a church with a Father in two persons,\nBazard and Enfantin. The service took place in a _bouis-bouis_. The\ncostume worn consisted of white trousers, a red waistcoat and a blue\ntunic. On the days when the Father came down from the heights of\nMenilmontant with his children, there was great diversion for the people\nin the street. An important thing was lacking in the organization of the\nSaint-Simonians. In order to complete the \"sacerdotal couple,\" a woman\nwas needed to take her place next the Father. A Mother was asked for\nover and over again. It was said that she would soon appear, but she was\nnever forthcoming. Saint-Simon had tried to tempt Madame de Stael.\n\n\"I am an extraordinary man,\" he said to her, \"and you are just as\nextraordinary as a woman. You and I together would have a still more\nextraordinary child.\" Madame de Stael evidently did not care to take\npart in the manufacture of this prodigy. When George Sand's first novels\nappeared, the Saint-Simonians were full of hope. This was the woman they\nhad been waiting for, the free woman, who having meditated on the lot of\nher sisters would formulate the Declaration of the rights and duties\nof woman. Adolphe Gueroult was sent to her. He was the editor of the\n_Opinion nationale_. George Sand had a great fund of common sense,\nthough, and once more the little society awaited the Mother in vain. It\nwas finally decided that she should be sought for in the East. A mission\nwas organized, and messengers were arrayed in white, as a sign of the\nvow of chastity, with a pilgrim's staff in their hand. They begged as\nthey went along, and slept sometimes outdoors, but more often at the\npolice-station. George Sand was not tempted by this kind of maternity,\nbut she kept in touch with the Saint-Simonians. She was present at\none of their meetings at Menilmontant. Her published _Correspondance_\ncontains a letter addressed by her to the Saint-Simonian family in\nParis. As a matter of fact, she had received from it, on the 1st of\nJanuary, 1836, a large collection of presents. There were in all no less\nthan fifty-nine articles, among which were the following: a dress-box, a\npair of boots, a thermometer, a carbine-carrier, a pair of trousers and\na corset.\n\nSaint-Simonism was universally jeered at, but it is quite a mistake to\nthink that ridicule is detrimental in France. On the contrary, it is an\nexcellent means of getting anything known and of spreading the knowledge\nof it abroad; it is in reality a force. Saint-Simonism is at the root\nof many of the humanitarian doctrines which were to spring up from its\nashes. One of its essential doctrines was the diffusion of the soul\nthroughout all humanity, and another that of being born anew. Enfantin\nsaid: \"I can feel St. Paul within me. He lives within me.\" Still\nanother of its doctrines was that of the rehabilitation of the flesh.\nSaint-Simonism proclaimed the equality of man and woman, that of\nindustry and art and science, and the necessity of a fresh repartition\nof wealth and of a modification of the laws concerning property. It also\nadvocated increasing the attributions of the State considerably. It was,\nin fact, the first of the doctrines offering to the lower classes,\nby way of helping them to bear their wretched misery, the ideal of\nhappiness here below, lending a false semblance of religion to the\ndesire for material well-being. George Sand had one vulnerable point,\nand that was her generosity. By making her believe that she was working\nfor the outcasts of humanity, she could be led anywhere, and this was\nwhat happened.\n\nAmong other great minds affected by the influence of Saint-Simonism, it\nis scarcely surprising to find Lamennais. When George Sand first knew\nhim, he was fifty-three years of age. He had broken with Rome, and\nwas the apocalyptic author of _Paroles d'un croyant_. He put into his\nrevolutionary faith all the fervour of his loving soul, a soul that\nhad been created for apostleship, and to which the qualification of \"a\ndisaffected cathedral\" certainly applied.\n\nAfter the famous trial, Liszt took him to call on George Sand in her\nattic. This was in 1835. She gives us the following portrait of him:\n\"Monsieur de Lamennais is short, thin, and looks ill. He seems to have\nonly the feeblest breath of life in his body, but how his face beams.\nHis nose is too prominent for his small figure and for his narrow\nface. If it were not for this nose out of all proportion, he would be\nhandsome. He was very easily entertained. A mere nothing made him laugh,\nand how heartily he laughed.\"(32) It was the gaiety of the seminarist,\nfor Monsieur Feli always remained the _Abbe_ de Lamennais. George Sand\nhad a passionate admiration for him. She took his side against any one\nwho attacked him in her third _Lettre d'un voyageur_, in her _Lettre a\nLerminier_, and in her article on _Amshaspands et Darvands_. This is\nthe title of a book by Lamennais. The extraordinary names refer to the\nspirits of good and evil in the mythology of Zoroaster. George Sand\nproposed to pronounce them _Chenapans et Pedants_. Although she had\na horror of journalism, she agreed to write in Lamennais' paper, _Le\nMonde._\n\n     (32) _Histoire de ma vie._\n\n\"He is so good and I like him so much,\" she writes, \"that I would give\nhim as much of my blood and of my ink as he wants.\"(33) She did not have\nto give him any of her blood, and he did not accept much of her ink. She\ncommenced publishing her celebrated _Lettres a Marcie_ in _Le Monde_. We\nhave already spoken of these letters, in order to show how George Sand\ngradually attenuated the harshness of her early feminism.\n\n     (33) _Correspondance_:  To Jules Janin, February 15, 1837.\n\nThese letters alarmed Lamennais, nevertheless, and she was obliged to\ndiscontinue them. Feminism was the germ of their disagreement. Lamennais\nsaid: \"She does not forgive St. Paul for having said: 'Wives, obey your\nhusbands.'\" She continued to acknowledge him as \"one of our saints,\"\nbut \"the father of our new Church\" gradually broke away from her and\nher friends, and expressed his opinion about her with a severity and\nharshness which are worthy of note.\n\nLamennais' letters to Baron de Vitrolles contain many allusions to\nGeorge Sand, and they are most uncomplimentary.\n\n\"I hear no more about Carlotta\" (Madame Marliani), he writes, \"nor about\nGeorge Sand and Madame d'Agoult. I know there has been a great deal of\nquarrelling among them. They are as fond of each other as Lesage's two\n_diables_, one of whom said: 'That reconciled us, we kissed each other,\nand ever since then we have been mortal enemies.'\" He also tells that\nthere is a report that in her novel, entitled _Horace_, she has given\nas unflattering a portrait as possible of her dear, sweet, excellent\nfriend, Madame d'Agoult, the _Arabella_ of the _Lettres d'un voyageur_.\n\"The portraits continue,\" he writes, \"all true to life, without being\nlike each other.\" In the same book, _Horace_, there is a portrait\nof Mallefille, who was beloved \"during one quarter of the moon,\" and\nabhorred afterwards. He concludes the letter with the following words:\n\"Ah, how fortunate I am to be forgotten by those people! I am not afraid\nof their indifference, but I should be afraid of their attentions. . . .\nSay what you like, my dear friend, those people do not tempt me at all.\nFutility and spitefulness dissolved in a great deal of _ennui_, is a\nbad kind of medicine.\" He then goes on to make fun, in terms that it is\ndifficult to quote, of the silly enthusiasm of a woman like Marliani,\nand even of George Sand, for the theories of Pierre Leroux, of which\nthey did not understand the first letter, but which had taken their\nfancy. George Sand may have looked upon Lamennais as a master, but it is\nvery evident that she was not his favoured disciple.\n\nIt was due to his teaching that George Sand obtained her definite\nideas about Catholicism, or rather against it. She was decidedly its\nadversary, because she held that the Church had stifled the spirit of\nliberty, that it had thrown a veil over the words of Christ, and that it\nwas the obstacle in the way of holy equality. What she owed specially,\nthough, to Lamennais was another lesson, of quite another character.\nLamennais was the man of the nineteenth century who waged the finest\nbattle against individualism, against \"the scandal of the adoration of\nman by man.\"(34)\n\n     (34) Compare Brunetiere, _Evolution de la poesie lyrique_,\n     vol.  i.  p.  310.\n\nUnder his influence, George Sand began to attach less importance to the\npersonal point of view, she ceased applying everything to herself, and\nshe discovered the importance of the life of others. If we study this\nattentively, we shall see that a new phase now commenced in the history\nof her ideas. Lamennais was the origin of this transformation, although\nit is personified in another man, and that other man, was named Pierre\nLeroux.\n\nWhat a strange mystery it is, among so many other mysteries, that of one\nmind taking possession of another mind. We have come into contact with\ngreat minds which have made no impression on us, whilst other minds, of\nsecondary intelligence, perhaps, and it may be inferior to our own, have\ngoverned us.\n\nBy the side of a Lamennais, this Pierre Leroux was a very puny\npersonage. He had been a compositor in a printing works, before founding\nthe _Globe_. This paper, in his hands, was to become an organ of\nSaint-Simonism. He belonged neither to the _bourgeois_ nor to the\nworking-class. He was Clumsy, not well built, and had an enormous shock\nof hair, which was the joy of caricaturists. He was shy and awkward, in\naddition to all this. He nevertheless appeared in various _salons_,\nand was naturally more or less ridiculous. In January, 1840, Beranger\nwrites: \"You must know that our metaphysician has surrounded himself\nwith women, at the head of whom are George Sand and Marliani, and that,\nin gilded drawing-rooms, under the light of chandeliers, he exposes his\nreligious principles and his muddy boots.\" George Sand herself made fun\nof this occasionally. In a letter to Madame d'Agoult, she writes:\n\n\"He is very amusing when he describes making his appearance in your\ndrawing-room of the Rue Laffitte. He says: 'I was all muddy, and quite\nashamed of myself. I was keeping out of sight as much as possible in a\ncorner. _This lady_ came to me and talked in the kindest way possible.\nShe is very beautiful.'\"(35)\n\n     (35) _Correspondance_:  To Madame d'Agoult, October 16, 1837.\n\nThere are two features about him, then, which seem to strike every one,\nhis unkemptness and his shyness. He expressed his ideas, which were\nalready obscure, in a form which seemed to make them even more obscure.\nIt has been said wittily that when digging out his ideas, he buried\nhimself in them.(36) Later on, when he spoke at public meetings, he was\nnoted for the nonsense he talked in his interminable and unintelligible\nharangues.\n\n     (36) P. Thureau-Dangin, _Histoire de la Monarchie de Juillet._\n\nAnd yet, in spite of all this, the smoke from this mind attracted George\nSand, and became her pillar of light moving on before her. His hazy\nphilosophy seemed to her as clear as daylight, it appealed to her heart\nand to her mind, solved her doubts, and gave her tranquillity, strength,\nfaith, hope and a patient and persevering love of humanity. It seems as\nthough, with that marvellous faculty that she had for idealizing always,\nshe manufactured a Pierre Leroux of her own, who was finer than the real\none. He was needy, but poverty becomes the man who has ideas. He was\nawkward, but the contemplative man, on coming down from the region of\nthought on to our earth once more, only gropes along. He was not clear,\nbut Voltaire tells us that when a man does not understand his own words,\nhe is talking metaphysics. Chopin had personified the artist for her;\nPierre Leroux, with his words as entangled as his hair, figured now to\nher as the philosopher. She saw in him the chief and the master. _Tu\nduca e tu maestro_.\n\nIn February, 1844, she wrote the following extraordinary lines: \"I must\ntell you that George Sand is only a pale reflection of Pierre Leroux, a\nfanatical disciple of the same ideal, but a disciple mute and fascinated\nwhen listening to his words, and quite prepared to throw all her own\nworks into the fire, in order to write, talk, think, pray and act under\nhis inspiration. I am merely the popularizer, with a ready pen and\nan impressionable mind, and I try to translate, in my novels, the\nphilosophy of the master.\"\n\nThe most extraordinary part about these lines is that they were\nabsolutely true. The whole secret of the productions of George Sand for\nthe next ten years is contained in these words. With Pierre Leroux and\nLouis Viardot she now founded a review, _La Revue independante_, in\nwhich she could publish, not only novels (beginning with _Horace_, which\nBuloz had refused), but articles by which philosophical-socialistic\nideas could have a free course. Better still than this, the novelist\ncould take the watchword from the sociologist, just as Mascarilla\nput Roman history into madrigals, she was able to put Pierre Leroux's\nphilosophy into novels.\n\nIt would be interesting to know what she saw in Pierre Leroux, and which\nof his ideas she approved and preferred. One of the ideas dear to Pierre\nLeroux was that of immortality, but an immortality which had very little\nin common with Christianity. According to it, we should live again after\ndeath, but in humanity and in another world. The idea of metempsychosis\nwas very much in vogue at this epoch. According to Jean Reynaud and\nLamennais, souls travelled from star to star, but Pierre Leroux believed\nin metempsychosis on earth.\n\n\"We are not only the children and the posterity of those who have\nalready lived, but we are, at bottom, the anterior generations\nthemselves. We have gone through former existences which we do not\nremember, but it may be that at times we have fragmentary reminiscences\nof them.\"\n\nGeorge Sand must have been very deeply impressed by this idea. It\ninspired her with _Sept cordes de la lyre_, _Spiridion_, _Consuelo_\nand the _Comtesse de Rudolstadt_, the whole cycle of her philosophical\nnovels.\n\nThe _Sept cordes de la lyre_ is a dramatic poem after the manner of\n_Faust_. Maitre Albertus is the old doctor conversing with Mephistocles.\nHe has a ward, named Helene, and a lyre. A spirit lives in this lyre.\nIt is all in vain that the painter, the _maestro_, the poet, the critic\nendeavour to make the cords vibrate. The lyre remains dumb. Helene, even\nwithout putting her hands on it, can draw from it magnificent harmony;\nHelene is mad. All this may seem very incomprehensible to you, and I\nmust confess that it is so to me. Albertus himself declares: \"This has a\npoetical sense of a very high order perhaps, but it seems vague to me.\"\nPersonally, I am of the same opinion as Albertus. With a little effort,\nI might, like any one else, be able to give you an interpretation of\nthis logogriph, which might appear to have something in it. I prefer\ntelling you frankly that I do not understand it. The author, perhaps,\ndid not understand it much better so that it may have been metaphysics.\n\nI would call your attention, though, to that picture of Helene, with the\nmagic lyre in her hand, risking her life, by climbing to the spire of\nthe steeple and uttering her inspiring speech from there. Is not this\nsomething like Solness, the builder, from the top of his tower? Like\nTolstoi, Ibsen had evidently read George Sand and had not forgotten her.\n\n_Spiridion_ introduces us into a strange convent, in which we see the\nportraits come out of their frames and roam about the cloisters. The\nfounder of the convent, Hebronius, lives again in the person of Father\nAlexis, who is no other than Leroux.\n\nIn _Consuelo_ we have the same imagination. We have already considered\nthe first part of this novel, that which takes place at Venice, in the\nschools of music and in the theatres of song. Who would have thought\nthat the charming diva, the pupil of Porpora, was to have such strange\nadventures? She arrives in Bohemia, at the Chateau of Rudolstadt. She\nhas been warned that extraordinary things take place there. Comte Albert\nde Rudolstadt is subject to nervous fits and to great lethargy. He\ndisappears from the chateau and then reappears, without any one seeing\nhim go in or out. He believes that he has been Jean Ziska, and this\nis probably true. He has been present at events which took place three\nhundred years previously, and he describes them. Consuelo discovers\nAlbert's retreat. It is a cavern hollowed out of a mountain in the\nvicinity, which communicates, by means of a well, with his rooms. The\nChateau of Rudolstadt is built on the same architectural plan as Anne\nRadcliffe's chateau. After staying for some time in this bewildering\nplace, Consuelo sets forth once more. She now meets Haydn, goes through\nthe Bohmer Wald with him, arrives in Venice, is introduced to Maria\nTheresa, and is engaged at the Imperial Theatre. She is now recalled to\nthe Chateau of Rudolstadt. Albert is on his deathbed, and he marries\nher _in extremis_, after telling her that he is going to leave her for a\ntime, but that he shall return to her on earth by a new birth. He, too,\nhad evidently read Pierre Leroux, and it was perhaps that which had\ncaused his illness.\n\n_Consuelo_ is a novel of adventures after the style of _Gil Blas_, the\n_Vie de Marianne_, and _Wilkelm Meister_. It is a historical novel, for\nwhich we have Joseph Haydn, Maria Theresa, Baron Trenk, and the whole\nhistory of the Hussites. It is a fantastical story with digressions\non music and on popular songs, but running through it all, with the\npersistency of a fixed idea, are divagations on the subject of\nearthly metempsychosis. Such, then, is this incongruous story, odd and\nexaggerated, but with gleams of light and of great beauty, the reading\nof which is apt to leave one weary and disturbed.\n\nWe meet with Consuelo again in another book. In those days, it was not\nenough for a novel to consist of several volumes. People liked a sequel\nalso. _Vingt ans apres_ was the sequel to _Trois Mousquetaires_, and the\n_Vicomte de Bragelonne_ was a sequel to that sequel. Our grandparents\nwere capable of allowing themselves to be bored to a degree which makes\nus ashamed of our frivolity. The _Comtesse de Rudolstadt_ was the sequel\nto _Consuelo_. As time went on, Pierre Leroux called George Sand's\nattention to the study of freemasonry. In 1843, she declared that she\nwas plunged in it, and that it was a gulf of nonsense and uncertainties,\nin which \"she was dabbling courageously.\"\n\n\"I am up to my ears in freemasonry,\" she writes. \"I cannot get away from\nthe kaddosh, the Rose Croix and the Sublime Scotchman. The result of all\nthis will be a mysterious novel.\" The mysterious novel was the _Comtesse\nde Rudolstadt_. Consuelo, who through her marriage with Albert is now\nComtesse de Rudolstadt, continues her European tour. She reaches Berlin,\nand we find her at the Court of Frederick II. We now have Voltaire,\nLa Mettrie, the Sans-Souci suppers, Cagliostro, Saint-Germain and the\noccult sciences. Frederick II sends Consuelo to prison. There appears\nto be no reason for this, unless it be that in order to escape she\nmust first have been imprisoned. Some mysterious rescuers take a great\ninterest in Consuelo, and transport her to a strange dwelling, where\nshe has a whole series of surprises. It is, in fact, a sort of Palace\nof Illusions. She is first in a dark room, and she then finds herself\nsuddenly in a room of dazzling light. \"At the far end of this room,\nthe whole aspect of which is very forbidding, she distinguishes seven\npersonages, wrapped in red cloaks and wearing masks of such livid\nwhiteness that they looked like corpses. They were all seated behind a\ntable of black marble. Just in front of the table, and on a lower seat,\nwas an eighth spectre. He was dressed in black, and he, too, wore a\nwhite mask. By the wall, on each side of the room, were about twenty men\nin black cloaks and masks. There was the most profound silence. Consuelo\nturned round and saw that there were also black phantoms behind her.\nAt each door there were two of them standing up, each holding a huge,\nbright sword.\"(37)\n\n     (37) _Comtesse de Rudolstadt._\n\nShe wondered whether she had reached the infernal regions, but she\ndiscovered that she was in the midst of a secret society, styled the\nInvisibles. Consuelo is to go through all the various stages of the\ninitiation. She first puts on the bridal dress, and after this the\nwidow's weeds. She undergoes all the various trials, and has to witness\nthe different spectacles provided for her edification, including\ncoffins, funeral palls, spectres and simulated tortures. The description\nof all the various ceremonies takes up about half of the book. George\nSand's object was to show up this movement of secret societies, which\nwas such a feature of the eighteenth century, and which was directed\nboth against monarchical power and against the Church. It contributed to\nprepare the way for the Revolution, and gave to this that international\ncharacter and that mystic allure which would otherwise have been\nincomprehensible.\n\nFrom _Spiridion_ to the _Comtesse de Rudolstadt_, then, we have this\nseries of fantastical novels with ghosts, subterranean passages, secret\nhiding-places, hallucinations and apparitions. The unfortunate part is\nthat at present we scarcely know to what category of readers they would\nappeal. As regards grown-up people, we all prefer something with a\nvestige of truth in it now-a-days. As to our children, they would prefer\n_Monte-Cristo_ to _Consuelo_, and _Tom Thumb_ to _Spiridion_. At the\ntime that they were written, in spite of the fact that Buloz protested\nagainst all this philosophy, these novels were quite in accordance with\nthe public taste. A mania for anything fantastic had taken possession\nof the most serious people. Ballanche wrote his _La Palingenesie_, and\nEdgar Quinet _Ahasverus_. Things took place through the ages, and the\nreader travelled through the immensity of the centuries, just as though\nWells had already invented his machine for exploring time. In a country\nlike France, where clear-mindedness and matter-of-fact intelligence are\nappreciated, all this seems surprising. It was no doubt the result of\ninfiltrations which had come from abroad. There was something wrong with\nus just then, \"something rotten in the kingdom of France.\" We see this\nby that fever of socialistic doctrines which burst forth among us about\nthe year 1840. We have the _Phalanstere_ by Fourier, _La Phalange_\nby Considerant, the _Icarie_ by Cabet, and his famous _Voyage_, which\nappeared that very year. We were always to be devoured by the State,\naccompanied by whatever sauce we preferred. The State was always to find\nus shelter, to dress us, to govern us and to tyrannize over us. There\nwas the State as employer, the State as general storekeeper, the State\nto feed us; all this was a dream of bliss. Buonarotti, formerly Babeuf's\naccomplice, preached Communism. Louis Blanc published his _Organisation\ndu travail_, in which he calls to his aid a political revolution,\nforetaste of a social revolution. Proudhon published his _Memoire sur la\npropriete_, containing the celebrated phrase: \"Property means theft.\"\nHe declared himself an anarchist, and as a matter of fact anarchy was\nalready everywhere. A fresh evil had suddenly made its appearance, and,\nby a cruel irony, it was the logical consequence of that industrial\ndevelopment of which the century was so proud. The result of all that\nwealth had been to create a new form of misery, an envious, jealous form\nof misery, much more cruel than the former one, for it filled the heart\nwith a ferment of hatred, a passion for destruction.\n\nIt was Pierre Leroux, also, who led George Sand on to Socialism. She had\nbeen on the way to it by herself. For a long time she had been raising\nan altar in her heart to that entity called the People, and she had been\nadorning it with all the virtues. The future belonged to the people, the\nwhole of the future, and first of all that of literature.\n\nPoetry was getting a little worn out, but to restore its freshness there\nwere the poets of the people. Charles Poncy, of Toulon, a bricklayer,\npublished a volume of poetry, in 1842, entitled _Marines_. George Sand\nadopted him. He was the demonstration of her theory, the example which\nillustrated her dream. She congratulated him and encouraged him. \"You\nare a great poet,\" she said to him, and she thereupon speaks of him to\nall her friends. \"Have you read Baruch?\" she asks them. \"Have you read\nPoncy, a poet bricklayer of twenty years of age?\" She tells every one\nabout his book, dwells on its beauties, and asks people to speak of it.\n\nAs a friend of George Sand, I have examined the poems by Poncy of which\nshe specially speaks. The first one is entitled _Meditation sur les\ntoits_. The poet has been obliged to stay on the roof to complete his\nwork, and while there he meditates.\n\n_\"Le travail me retient bien tard sur ces toitures_. . . .\"\n\nHe then begins to wonder what he would see if, like Asmodee in the\n_Diable boiteux_, he could have the roof taken off, so that the various\nrooms could be exposed to view. Alas! he would not always find the\nconcord of the Golden Age.\n\n     _Que de fois contemolant cet amas de maisons\n     Quetreignent nos remparts couronnes de gazons,\n     Et ces faubourgs naissants que la ville trop pleine\n     Pour ses enfants nouveaux eleve dans la plaine.\n     Immobiles troufieaux ou notre clocher gris\n     Semble un patre au milieu de ses blanches brebis,\n     Jai pense que, malgre notre angoisse et nos peines,\n     Sous ces toits paternels il existait des haines,\n     Et que des murs plus forts que ces murs mitoyens\n     Separent ici-bas les coeurs des citoyens._\n\nThis was an appeal to concord, and all brothers of humanity were invited\nto rally to the watchword.\n\nThe intention was no doubt very good. Then, too, _murs mitoyens_ was\nan extremely rich and unexpected rhyme for _citoyens_. This was worthy\nindeed of a man of that party.\n\nAnother of the poems greatly admired by George Sand was _Le Forcat_.\n\n     _Regarder le forcat sur la poutre equarrie\n     Poser son sein hale que le remords carie_. . .\n\nCertainly if Banville were to lay claim to having invented rhymes that\nare puns, we could only say that he was a plagiarist after reading\nCharles Poncy.\n\nIn another poem addressed to the rich, entitled _L'hiver_, the poet\nnotices with grief that the winter\n\n     . . .  _qui remplit les salons, les Watres,\n     Remplit aussi la Morgue et les amphitheatres._\n\nHe is afraid that the people will, in the end, lose their patience, and\nso he gives to the happy mortals on this earth the following counsel:\n\n     _Riches, a vos plaisirs faites participer\n     L'homme que les malheurs s'acharnent a frapper\n     Oh, faites travailler le pere de famille,\n     Pour qu'il puisse arbiter la pudeur de sa fille,\n     Pourqu'aux petits enfants maigris par les douleurs\n     Il rapporte, le soir, le pain et non des pleurs,\n     Afin que son epouse, au desespoir en proie,\n     Se ranime a sa vue et l'embrasse avec joie,\n     Afin qua l'Eternel, a l'heure de sa mort.\n     Vous n'offriez pas un coeur carie de remords_.\n\nThe expression certainly leaves much to be desired in these poems, but\nthey are not lacking in eloquence. We had already had something of this\nkind, though, written by a poet who was not a bricklayer. He, too, had\nasked the rich the question following:\n\n     _Dans vos fetes d'hiver, riches, heureux du monde,\n     Quand le bal tournoyant de ses feux vous inonde. . .\n     Songez-vous qu'il est la, sous le givre et la neige,\n     Ce pere sans travail que la famine assiege?_\n\nHe advises them to practise charity, the sister of prayer.\n\n     \"_Donnez afin qu'un jour, a votre derniere heure,\n     Contre tous vos peches vous ayez la Priere\n     D'un mendiant puissant au ciel_.\"\n\nWe cannot, certainly, expect Poncy to be a Victor Hugo. But as we had\nVictor Hugo's verses, of what use was it for them to be rewritten by\nPoncy? My reason for quoting a few of the fine lines from _Feuilles\nd'automne_ is that I felt an urgent need of clearing away all these\nplatitudes. Poncy was not the only working-man poet. Other trades\nproduced their poets too. The first poem in _Marines_ is addressed to\nDurand, a poet carpenter, who introduces himself as \"_Enfant de la foret\nqui ceint Fontainebleau_.\"\n\nThis man handled the plane and the lyre, just as Poncy did the trowel\nand the lyre.\n\nThis poetry of the working-classes was to give its admirers plenty of\ndisappointment. George Sand advised Poncy to treat the things connected\nwith his trade, in his poetry. \"Do not try to put on other men's\nclothes, but let us see you in literature with the plaster on your hands\nwhich is natural to you and which interests us,\" she said to him.\n\nProud of his success with the ladies of Paris, Poncy wanted to wash\nhis hands, put on a coat, and go into society. It was all in vain that\nGeorge Sand beseeched Poncy to remain the poet of humanity. She exposed\nto him the dogma of impersonality in such fine terms, that more than one\n_bourgeois_ poet might profit by what she said.\n\n\"An individual,\" she said, \"who poses as a poet, as a pure artist, as\na god like most of our great men do, whether they be _bourgeois_ or\naristocrats, soon tires us with his personality. . . . Men are only\ninterested in a man when that man is interested in humanity.\"\n\nThis was all of no use, though, for Poncy was most anxious to treat\nother subjects rather more lively and--slightly libertine. His literary\ngodmother admonished him.\n\n\"You are dedicating to _Juana l'Espagnole_ and to various other\nfantastical beauties verses that I do not approve. Are you a _bourgeois_\npoet or a poet of the people? If the former, you can sing in honour of\nall the voluptuousness and all the sirens of the universe, without ever\nhaving known either. You can sup with the most delicious houris or\nwith all the street-walkers, in your poems, without ever leaving\nyour fireside or having seen any greater beauty than the nose of your\nhall-porter. These gentlemen write their poetry in this way, and their\nrhyming is none the worse for it. But if you are a child of the people\nand the poet of the people, you ought not to leave the chaste breast of\nDesiree, in order to run about after dancing-girls and sing about their\nvoluptuous arms.\"(38)\n\n     (38) See the letters addressed to Charles Poncy in the\n     _Correspondance._\n\nIt is to be hoped that Poncy returned to the chaste Desiree. But why\nshould he not read to the young woman the works of Pierre Leroux?\nWe need a little gaiety in our life. In George Sand's published\n_Correspondance_, we only have a few of her letters to Charles Poncy.\nThey are all in excellent taste. There is an immense correspondence\nwhich M. Rocheblave will publish later on. This will be a treat for us,\nand it will no doubt prove that there was a depth of immense candour in\nthe celebrated authoress.\n\nIt does not seem to me that the writings of the working-men poets have\ngreatly enriched French literature. Fortunately George Sand's sympathy\nwith the people found its way into literature in another way, and this\ntime in a singularly interesting way. She did not get the books written\nby the people themselves, but she put the people into books. This was\nthe plan announced by George Sand in her preface to the _Compagnon du\ntour de France_. There is an entirely fresh literature to create, she\nwrites, \"with the habits and customs of the people, as these are so\nlittle known by the other classes.\" The _Compagnon du tour de France_\nwas the first attempt at this new literature of the people. George Sand\nhad obtained her documents for this book from a little work which\nhad greatly struck her, entitled _Livre du compagnonnage_, written by\nAgricol Perdiguier, surnamed Avignonnais-la-Vertu, who was a _compagnon_\ncarpenter. Agricol Perdiguier informs us that the _Compagnons_ were\ndivided into three chief categories: the _Gavots_, the _Devorants_\nand the _Drilles_, or the _Enfants de Salomon_, the _Enlants de Maitre\nJacques_ and the _Enfants du_ _Pere Soubise_. He then describes the\nrites of this order. When two _Compagnons_ met, their watchword was\n\"_Tope_.\" After this they asked each other's trade, and then they went\nto drink a glass together. If a _Compagnon_ who was generally respected\nleft the town, the others gave him what was termed a \"conduite en\nregle.\" If it was thought that he did not deserve this, he had a\n\"conduite de Grenoble.\" Each _Compagnon_ had a surname, and among such\nsurnames we find _The Prudence of Draguignan_, _The Flower of Bagnolet_\nand _The Liberty of Chateauneuf_. The unfortunate part was that among\nthe different societies, instead of the union that ought to have\nreigned, there were rivalries, quarrels, fights, and sometimes all this\nled to serious skirmishes; Agricol Perdiguier undertook to preach to\nthe different societies peace and tolerance. He went about travelling\nthrough France with this object in view. His second expedition was-at\nGeorge Sand's expense.\n\nA fresh edition of his book contained the letters of approval addressed\nto him by those who approved his campaign. Among these signatures\nare the following: Nantais-Pret-a-bien-faire, Bourgignonla-Felicite,\nDecide-le-Briard. All this is a curious history of the syndicates of the\nnineteenth century. Agricol Perdiguier may have seen the _Confederation\ndu Travail_ dawning in the horizon.\n\nIn the _Compagnon du Tour de France_, Pierre Huguenin, a\ncarpenter, travels about among all these different societies of the\n_Compagnonnage_, and lets us see something of their competition,\nrivalries, battles, etc. He is then sent for to the Villepreux Chateau,\nto do some work. The noble Yseult falls in love with this fine-talking\ncarpenter, and at once begs him to make her happy by marrying her.\n\nIn the _Meunier d'Angibault_ it is a working locksmith, Henri Lemor, who\nfalls in love with Marcelle de Blanchemont. Born to wealth, she regrets\nthat she is not the daughter or the mother of workingmen. Finally,\nhowever, she loses her fortune, and rejoices in this event. The\npersonage who stands out in relief in this novel is the miller, Grand\nLouis. He is always gay and contented, with a smile on his lips, singing\nlively songs and giving advice to every one.\n\nIn the _Peche de M. Antoine_, the _role_ of Grand Louis falls to Jean\nthe carpenter. In this story all the people are communists, with the\nexception of the owner of the factory, who, in consequence, is treated\nwith contempt. His son Emile marries the daughter of Monsieur Antoine.\nHer name is Gilberte, and a silly old man, the Marquis de Boisguilbaut,\nleaves her all his money, on condition that the young couple found a\ncolony of agriculturists in which there shall be absolute communism. All\nthese stories, full of eloquence and dissertations on the misfortune\nof being rich and the corrupting influence of wealth, would be\ninsufferable, if it were not for the fact that the Angibault mill were\nin the Black Valley, and the crumbling chateau, belonging to Monsieur\nAntoine, on the banks of the Creuse.\n\nThey are very poor novels, and it would be a waste of time to attempt\nto defend them. They are not to be despised, though, as regards their\ninfluence on the rest of George Sand's work, and also as regards the\nhistory of the French novel. They rendered great service to George\nSand, inasmuch as they helped her to come out of herself and to turn her\nattention to the miseries of other people, instead of dwelling all the\ntime on her own. The miseries she now saw were more general ones, and\nconsequently more worthy of interest. In the history of the novel they\nare of capital importance, as they are the first ones to bring into\nnotice, by making them play a part, people of whom novelists had never\nspoken. Before Eugene Sue and before Victor Hugo, George Sand gives a\n_role_ to a mason, a carpenter and a joiner. We see the working-class\ncome into literature in these novels, and this marks an era.\n\nAs to their socialistic influence, it is supposed by many people that\nthey had none. The kind of socialism that consists of making tinkers\nmarry marchionesses, and duchesses marry zinc-workers, seems very\nchildish and very feminine. It is just an attempt at bringing about the\nmarriage of classes. This socialistic preaching, by means of literature,\ncannot be treated so lightly, though, as it is by no means harmless. It\nis, on the contrary, a powerful means of diffusing doctrines to which\nit lends the colouring of imagination, and for which it appeals to the\nfeelings. George Sand propagated the humanitarian dream among a whole\ncategory of men and women who read her books. But for her, they would\nprobably have turned a deaf ear to the inducements held out to them with\nregard to this Utopia. Lamartine with his _Girondins_ reconciled the\n_bourgeois_ classes to the idea of the Revolution. In both cases the\neffect was the same, and it is just this which literature does in\naffairs of this kind. Its _role_ consists here in creating a sort of\nsnobbism, and this snobbism, created by literature in favour of all the\nelements of social destruction, continues to rage at present. We still\nsee men smiling indulgently and stupidly at doctrines of revolt and\nanarchy, which they ought to repudiate, not because of their own\ninterest, but because it is their duty to repudiate them with all\nthe strength of their own common sense and rectitude. Instead of any\narguments, we have facts to offer. All this was in 1846, and the time\nwas now drawing near when George Sand was to see those novels of hers\nactually taking place in the street, so that she could throw down to the\nrioters the bulletins that she wrote in their honour.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n1848\n\nGEORGE SAND AND THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT--HER PASTORAL NOVELS\n\n\nIN 1846, George Sand published _Le Peche de M. Antoine_. It was a very\ndull story of a sin, for sins are not always amusing. The same year,\nthough, she published _La Mare au Diable_. People are apt to say, when\ncomparing the socialistic novels and the pastoral novels by George Sand,\nthat the latter are superb, because they are the result of a conception\nof art that was quite disinterested, as the author had given up her\npreaching mania, and devoted herself to depicting people that she knew\nand things that she liked, without any other care than that of painting\nthem well. Personally, I think that this was not so. George Sand's\npastoral style is not essentially different from her socialistic style.\nThe difference is only in the success of the execution, but the ideas\nand the intentions are the same. George Sand is continuing her mission\nin them, she is going on with her humanitarian dream, that dream which\nshe dreamed when awake.\n\nWe have a proof of this in the preface of the author to the reader with\nwhich the _Mare au Diable_ begins. This preface would be disconcerting\nto any one who does not remember the intellectual atmosphere in which it\nwas written.\n\nPeople have wondered by what fit of imagination George Sand, when\ntelling such a wholesome story of country life, should evoke the ghastly\nvision of Holbein's Dance of Death. It is the close of day, the horses\nare thin and exhausted, there is an old peasant, and, skipping about in\nthe furrows near the team, is Death, the only lively, careless,\nnimble being in this scene of \"sweat and weariness.\" She gives us the\nexplanation of it herself. She wanted to show up the ideal of the new\norder of things, as opposed to the old ideal, as translated by the\nghastly dance.\n\n\"We have nothing more to do with death,\" she writes, \"but with life. We\nno longer believe in the _neant_ of the tomb, nor in salvation bought by\nenforced renunciation. We want life to be good, because we want it to be\nfertile. . . . Every one must be happy, so that the happiness of a few\nmay not be criminal and cursed by God.\" This note we recognize as the\ncommon feature of all the socialistic Utopias. It consists in taking the\nopposite basis to that on which the Christian idea is founded. Whilst\nChristianity puts off, until after death, the possession of happiness,\ntransfiguring death by its eternal hopes, Socialism places its Paradise\non earth. It thus runs the risk of leaving all those without any\nrecourse who do not find this earth a paradise, and it has no answer to\ngive to the lamentations of incurable human misery.\n\nGeorge Sand goes on to expose to us the object of art, as she\nunderstands it. She believes that it is for pleading the cause of the\npeople.\n\nShe does not consider that her _confreres_ in novel-writing and in\nSocialism set about their work in the best way. They paint poverty that\nis ugly and vile, and sometimes even vicious and criminal. How is it to\nbe expected that the bad, rich man will take pity on the sorrows of\nthe poor man, if this poor man is always presented to him as an escaped\nconvict or a night loafer? It is very evident that the people, as\npresented to us in the _Mysteres de Paris_, are not particularly\ncongenial to us, and we should have no wish to make the acquaintance of\nthe \"Chourineur.\" In order to bring about conversions, George Sand has\nmore faith in gentle, agreeable people, and, in conclusion, she tells\nus: \"We believe that the mission of art is a mission of sentiment and\nof love, and that the novel of to-day ought to take the place of the\nparable and the apologue of more primitive times.\" The object of the\nartist, she tells us, \"is to make people appreciate what he presents to\nthem.\" With that end in view, he has a right to embellish his subjects\na little. \"Art,\" we are told, \"is not a study of positive reality; it is\nthe seeking for ideal truth.\" Such is the point of view of the author of\n_La Mare au Diable_, which we are invited to consider as a parable and\nan apologue.\n\nThe parable is clear enough, and the apologue is eloquent. The novel\ncommences with that fine picture of the ploughing of the fields, so rich\nin description and so broadly treated that there seems to be nothing in\nFrench literature to compare with it except the episode of the Labourers\nin _Jocelyn_. When _Jocelyn_ was published, George Sand was severe in\nher criticism of it, treating it as poor work, false in sentiment and\ncareless in style. \"In the midst of all this, though,\" she adds, \"there\nare certain pages and chapters such as do not exist in any language,\npages that I read seven times over, crying all the time like a donkey.\"\nI fancy that she must have cried over the episode of the _Labourers_.\nWhether she remembered it or not when writing her own book little\nmatters. My only reason for mentioning it is to point out the affinity\nof genius between Lamartine and George Sand, both of them so admirable\nin imagining idylls and in throwing the colours of their idyllic\nimagination on to reality.\n\nI have ventured, to analyze the _Comtesse de Rudolstadt_ and even\n_Consuelo_, but I shall not be guilty of the bad taste of telling the\nstory of _La Mare au Diable_, as all the people of that neighbourhood\nare well known to us, and have been our friends for a long time. We are\nall acquainted with Germain, the clever farm-labourer, with Marie, the\nshepherdess, and with little Pierre. We remember how they climbed the\n_Grise_, lost their way in the mist, and were obliged to spend the night\nunder the great oak-trees. When we were only about fifteen years of age,\nwith what delight we read this book, and how we loved that sweet Marie\nfor her simple grace and her affection, which all seemed so maternal.\nHow much better we liked her than the Widow Guerin, who was so snobbish\nwith her three lovers. And how glad we were to be present at that\nwedding, celebrated according to the custom in Berry from time\nimmemorial.\n\nIt is easy to see the meaning of all these things. They show us how\nnatural kindliness is to the heart of man. If we try to find out why\nGermain and Marie appear so delightful to us, we shall discover that it\nis because they are simple-hearted, and follow the dictates of Nature.\nNature must not be deformed, therefore, by constraint nor transformed by\nconvention, as it leads straight to virtue.\n\nWe have heard the tune of this song before, and we have seen the\nblossoming of some very fine pastoral poems and a veritable invasion of\nsentimental literature. In those days tears were shed plentifully\nover poetry, novels and plays. We have had Bernardin de Saint-Pierre,\nSedaine, Florian and Berquin. The Revolution, brutal and sanguinary as\nit was, did not interrupt the course of these romantic effusions. Never\nwere so many tender epithets used as during the years of the Reign of\nTerror, and in official processions Robespierre was adorned with flowers\nlike a village bride.\n\nThis taste for pastoral things, at the time of the Revolution, was not a\nmere coincidence. The same principles led up to the idyll in literature\nand to the Revolution in history. Man was supposed to be naturally good,\nand the idea was to take away from him all the restraints which had\nbeen invented for curbing his nature. Political and religious authority,\nmoral discipline and the prestige of tradition had all formed a kind of\nnetwork of impediments, by which man had been imprisoned by legislators\nwho were inclined to pessimism. By doing away with all these fetters,\nthe Golden Age was to be restored and universal happiness was to be\nestablished. Such was the faith of the believers in the millennium\nof 1789, and of 1848. The same dream began over and over again, from\nDiderot to Lamartine and from Jean-Jacques to George Sand. The same\nstate of mind which we see reflected in _La Mare au Diable_ was to make\nof George Sand the revolutionary writer of 1848. We can now understand\nthe _role_ which the novelist played in the second Republic. It is\none of the most surprising pages in the history of this extraordinary\ncharacter.\n\nThe joy with which George Sand welcomed the Republic can readily be\nimagined. She had been a Republican ever since the days of Michel of\nBourges, and a democrat since the time when, as a little girl, she took\nthe side of her plebeian mother against \"the old Countesses.\" For a long\ntime she had been wishing for and expecting a change of government.\nShe would not have been satisfied with less than this. She was not much\nmoved by the Thiers-Guizot duel, and it would have given her no pleasure\nto be killed for the sake of Odilon Barrot. She was a disciple of\nRomanticism, and she wanted a storm. When the storm broke, carrying all\nbefore it, a throne, a whole society with its institutions, she hurried\naway from her peaceful Nohant. She wanted to breathe the atmosphere of a\nrevolution, and she was soon intoxicated by it.\n\n\"Long live the Republic,\" she wrote in her letters. \"What a dream and\nwhat enthusiasm, and then, too, what behaviour, what order in Paris. I\nhave just arrived, and I saw the last of the barricades. The people are\ngreat, sublime, simple and generous, the most admirable people in the\nuniverse. I spent nights without any sleep and days without sitting\ndown. Every one was wild and intoxicated with delight, for after going\nto sleep in the mire they have awakened in heaven.\"(39)\n\n     (39) _Correspondance:  _ To Ch.  Poncy, March 9, 1848.\n\nShe goes on dreaming thus of the stars. Everything she hears, everything\nshe sees enchants her. The most absurd measures delight her. She either\nthinks they are most noble, liberal steps to have taken, or else they\nare very good jokes.\n\n\"Rothschild,\" she writes, \"expresses very fine sentiments about liberty\nat present. The Provisional Government is keeping him in sight, as it\ndoes not wish him to make off with his money, and so will put some\nof the troops on his track. The most amusing things are happening.\" A\nlittle later on she writes: \"The Government and the people expect to\nhave bad deputies, but they have agreed to put them through the window.\nYou must come, and we will go and see all this and have fun.\"(40)\n\n     (40) _Correspondance:_ To Maurice Sand, March 24, 1848.\n\nShe was thoroughly entertained, and that is very significant. We must\nnot forget the famous phrase that sounded the death-knell of the July\nmonarchy, \"La France s'ennuie.\" France had gone in for a revolution by\nway of being entertained.\n\nGeorge Sand was entertained, then, by what was taking place. She went\ndown into the street where there was plenty to see. In the mornings\nthere were the various coloured posters to be read. These had been put\nup in the night, and they were in prose and in verse.\n\nProcessions were also organized, and men, women and children, with\nbanners unfurled, marched along to music to the Hotel de Ville, carrying\nbaskets decorated with ribbons and flowers. Every corporation and\nevery profession considered itself bound in honour to congratulate the\nGovernment and to encourage it in its well-doing. One day the procession\nwould be of the women who made waistcoats or breeches, another day\nof the water-carriers, or of those who had been decorated in July\nor wounded in February; then there were the pavement-layers, the\nwasherwomen, the delegates from the Paris night-soil men. There were\ndelegates, too, from the Germans, Italians, Poles, and most of the\ninhabitants of Montmartre and of Batignolles. We must not forget the\ntrees of Liberty, as George Sand speaks of meeting with three of these\nin one day. \"Immense pines,\" she writes, \"carried on the shoulders of\nfifty working-men. A drum went first, then the flag, followed by bands\nof these fine tillers of the ground, strong-looking, serious men with\nwreaths of leaves on their head, and a spade, pick-axe or hatchet over\ntheir shoulder. It was magnificent; finer than all the _Roberts_ in the\nworld.\"(41) Such was the tone of her letters.\n\n     (41) _Correspondance._\n\nShe had the Opera from her windows and an Olympic circus at every\ncross-road. Paris was certainly _en fete_. In the evenings it was just\nas lively. There were the Clubs, and there were no less than three\nhundred of these. Society women could go to them and hear orators\nin blouses proposing incendiary movements, which made them shudder\ndeliciously. Then there were the theatres. Rachel, draped in antique\nstyle, looking like a Nemesis, declaimed the _Marseillaise_. And all\nnight long the excitement continued. The young men organized torchlight\nprocessions, with fireworks, and insisted on peaceably-inclined citizens\nilluminating. It was like a National Fete day, or the Carnival,\ncontinuing all the week.\n\nAll this was the common, everyday aspect of Paris, but there were the\nspecial days as well to break the monotony of all this. There were\nthe manifestations, which had the great advantage of provoking\ncounter-manifestations. On the 16th of March, there was the\nmanifestation of the National Guard, who were tranquil members of\nsociety, but on the 17th there was a counter-manifestation of the Clubs\nand workingmen. On such days the meeting-place would be at the Bastille,\nand from morning to night groups, consisting of several hundred thousand\nmen, would march about Paris, sometimes in favour of the Assembly\nagainst the Provisional Government, and sometimes in favour of the\nProvisional Government against the Assembly. On the 17th of April,\nGeorge Sand was in the midst of the crowd, in front of the Hotel de\nVille, in order to see better. On the 15th of May, as the populace was\ndirecting its efforts against the Palais Bourbon, she was in the Rue de\nBourgogne, in her eagerness not to miss anything. As she was passing\nin front of a _cafe_, she saw a woman haranguing the crowd in a very\nanimated way from one of the windows. She was told that this woman\nwas George Sand. Women were extremely active in this Revolution. They\norganized a Legion for themselves, and were styled _\"Les Vesuviennes_.\"\nThey had their clubs, their banquets and their newspapers. George Sand\nwas far from approving all this feminine agitation, but she did\nnot condemn it altogether. She considered that \"women and children,\ndisinterested as they are in all political questions, are in more direct\nintercourse with the spirit that breathes from above over the agitations\nof this world.\"(42) It was for them, therefore, to be the inspirers of\npolitics. George Sand was one of these inspirers. In order to judge what\ncounsels this Egeria gave, we have only to read some of her letters.\nOn the 4th of March, she wrote as follows to her friend Girerd: \"Act\nvigorously, my dear brother. In our present situation, we must have even\nmore than devotion and loyalty; we must have fanaticism if necessary.\"\nIn conclusion, she says that he is not to hesitate \"in sweeping away\nall that is of a _bourgeois_ nature.\" In April she wrote to Lamartine,\nreproaching him with his moderation and endeavouring to excite his\nrevolutionary spirit. Later on, although she was not of a very warlike\ndisposition, she regretted that they had not, like their ancestors of\n1793, cemented their Revolution at home by a war with the nations.\n\n     (42) _Correspondance:_ To the Citizen Thore, May 28, 1848.\n\n\"If, instead of following Lamartine's stupid, insipid policy,\" she then\nwrote, \"we had challenged all absolute monarchies, we should have had\nwar outside, but union at home, and strength, in consequence of this,\nit home and abroad.\"(43) Like the great ancestors, she declared that the\nrevolutionary idea is neither that of a sect nor of a party. \"It is a\nreligion,\" she says, \"that we want to proclaim.\" All this zeal, this\npassion and this persistency in a woman is not surprising, but one does\nnot feel much confidence in a certain kind of inspiration for politics\nafter all this.\n\n     (43) _Correspondance:_ To Mazzini, October 10, 1849.\n\nMy reason for dwelling on the subject is that George Sand did not\ncontent herself with merely looking on at the events that were taking\nplace, or even with talking about them with her friends. She took part\nin the events, by means of her pen. She scattered abroad all kinds of\nrevolutionary writings. On the 7th of March, she published her first\n_Letter to the People_, at the price of a penny, the profits of which\nwere to be distributed among working-men without employment. After\ncongratulating these great and good people on their noble victory, she\ntells them they are all going to seek together for the truth of things.\nThat was exactly the state of the case. They did not yet know what they\nwanted, but, in the mean time, while they were considering, they had\nat any rate begun with a revolution. There was a second _Letter to the\nPeople_, and then these ceased. Publications in those days were very\nshort-lived. They came to life again, though, sometimes from their\nashes. In April a newspaper was started, entitled _The Cause of the\nPeople_. This was edited almost entirely by George Sand. She wrote the\nleading article: _Sovereignty is Equality_. She reproduced her first\n_Letter to the People_, gave an article on the aspect of the streets of\nParis, and another on theatrical events. She left to her collaborator,\nVictor Borie, the task of explaining that the increase of taxes was an\neminently republican measure, and an agreeable surprise for the person\nwho had to pay them. The third number of this paper contained a one-act\nplay by George Sand, entitled _Le Roi attend_. This had just been given\nat the Comedie-Francaise, or at the Theatre de la Republique, as it\nwas then called. It had been a gratis performance, given on the 9th of\nApril, 1848, as a first national representation. The actors at that time\nwere Samson, Geffroy, Regnier, Anais, Augustine Brohan and Rachel. There\nwere not many of them, but they had some fine things to interpret.\n\nIn George Sand's piece, Moliere was at work with his servant, Laforet,\nwho could not read, but without whom, it appears, he could not have\nwritten a line. He has not finished his play, the actors have not learnt\ntheir parts, and the king is impatient at being kept waiting. Moliere is\nperplexed, and, not knowing what to do, he decides to go to sleep. The\nMuse appears to him, styles him \"the light of the people,\" and brings to\nhim all the ghosts of the great poets before him. AEschylus, Sophocles,\nEuripides and Shakespeare all declare to him that, in their time, they\nhad all worked towards preparing the Revolution of 1848. Moliere then\nwakes up, and goes on to the stage to pay his respects to the king. The\nking has been changed, though. \"I see a king,\" says Moliere, \"but his\nname is not Louis XIV. It is the people, the sovereign people. That is a\nword I did not know, a word as great as eternity.\"\n\nWe recognize the democrat in all this. _Le Roi_ _attend_ may be\nconsidered as an authentic curiosity of revolutionary art. The newspaper\nannounced to its readers that subscriptions could be paid in the Rue\nRichelieu. Subscribers were probably not forthcoming, as the paper died\na natural death after the third number.\n\nGeorge Sand did much more than this, though.(44) We must not forget that\nshe was an official publicist in 1848. She had volunteered her\nservices to Ledru-Rollin, and he had accepted them. \"I am as busy as\na statesman,\" she wrote at this time. \"I have already written two\nGovernment circulars.\"(45)\n\n     (44) With regard to George Sand's _role_, see _La Revolution\n     de_ 1848, by Daniel Stern (Madame d'Agoult).\n\n     (45) _Correspondance:_ To Maurice Sand, March 24, 1848.\n\nWith George Sand's collaboration, the _Bulletin de la Republique_ became\nunexpectedly interesting. This paper was published every other day,\nby order of Ledru-Rollin, and was intended to establish a constant\ninterchange of ideas and sentiments between the Government and the\npeople. \"It was specially addressed to the people of rural districts,\nand was in the form of a poster that the mayor of the place could have\nput up on the walls, and also distribute to the postmen to be given\naway. The _Bulletins_ were anonymous, but several of them were certainly\nwritten by George Sand. The seventh is one of these, and also the\ntwelfth. The latter was written with a view to drawing the attention\nof the public to the wretched lot of the women and girls of the lower\nclasses, who were reduced to prostitution by the lowness of their wages.\nTheir virginity is an object of traffic,\" we are told, \"quoted on the\nexchange of infamy.\" The sixteenth _Bulletin_ was simply an appeal for\nrevolt. George Sand was looking ahead to what ought to take place, in\ncase the elections did not lead to the triumph of social truth. \"The\npeople,\" she hoped, \"would know their duty. There would, in that case,\nbe only one way of salvation for the people who had erected barricades,\nand that would be to manifest their will a second time, and so adjourn\nthe decisions of a representation that was not national.\" This was\nnothing more nor less than the language of another Fructidor. And we\nknow what was the result of words in those days. The _Bulletin_ was\ndated the 15th, and on the 17th the people were on the way to the Hotel\nde Ville. These popular movements cannot always be trusted, though, as\nthey frequently take an unexpected turn, and even change their direction\nwhen on the way. It happened this time that the manifestation turned\nagainst those who were its instigators. Shouts were heard that day in\nParis of _\"Death to the Communists\"_ and _\"Down with Cabet_.\" George\nSand could not understand things at all. This was not in the programme,\nand she began to have her doubts about the future of the Republic--the\nreal one, that of her friends.\n\nIt was much worse on the 15th of May, the day which was so fatal to\nBarbes, for he played the part of hero and of dupe on that eventful day.\nBarbes was George Sand's idol at that time.\n\nIt was impossible for her to be without one, although, with her vivid\nimagination, she changed her idols frequently. With her idealism, she\nwas always incarnating in some individual the perfections that she was\nconstantly imagining. It seems as though she exteriorized the needs of\nher own mind and put them into an individual who seemed suitable to\nher for the particular requirements of that moment. At the time of the\nmonarchy, Michel of Bourges and Pierre Leroux had been able to play the\npart, the former of a radical theorician and the latter of the mystical\nforerunner of the new times. At present Barbes had come on to the scene.\n\nHe was a born conspirator, the very man for secret societies. He had\nmade his career by means of prisons, or rather he had made prison his\ncareer, In 1835, he had commenced by helping thirty of the prisoners of\nApril to escape from Sainte-Pelagie. At that time he was affiliated to\nthe _Societe des Familles_. The police discovered a whole arsenal of\npowder and ammunition at the house in the Rue de Lourcine, and Barbes\nwas condemned to prison for a year and sent to Carcassonne, where he had\nrelatives. When he left prison, the _Societe des Saisons_ had taken the\nplace of the _Societe des Familles_. With Blanqui's approval, Barbes\norganized the insurrection of May 12 and 13, 1830. This time blood was\nshed. In front of the Palais de Justice, the men, commanded by Barbes,\nhad invited Lieutenant Droulneau to let them enter. The officer replied\nthat he would die first. He was immediately shot, but Barbes was\nsentenced to death for this. Thanks to the intervention of Lamartine\nand Victor Hugo, his life was spared, but he was imprisoned at Mont\nSaint-Michel until 1843, and afterwards at Nimes. On the 28th of\nFebruary, 1848, the Governor of Nimes prison informed him that he was\nfree. He was more surprised and embarrassed than pleased by this news.\n\n\"I was quite bewildered,\" he owned later on, \"by this idea of leaving\nprison. I looked at my prison bed, to which I had grown so accustomed. I\nlooked at my blanket and at my pillow and at all my belongings, hung\nso carefully at the foot of my bed.\" He asked permission to stay there\nanother day. He had become accustomed to everything, and when once he\nwas out again, and free, he was like a man who feels ill at ease.\n\nHe took part in the affair of the 15th of May, and this is what gives\na tragic, and at the same time comic, character to the episode. Under\npretext of manifesting in favour of Poland, the National Assembly was\nto be invaded. Barbes did not approve of this manifestation, and\nhad decided to keep out of it. Some people cannot be present at a\nrevolutionary scene without taking part in it, and without soon wanting\nto play the chief part in it. The excitement goes to their head. Barbes\nseems to have been obeying in instinct over which he had no control,\nfor, together with a workman named Albert, he headed the procession\nwhich was to march from the Chamber of Deputies to the Hotel de Ville\nand establish a fresh Provisional Government. He had already commenced\ncomposing the proclamations to be thrown through the windows to the\npeople, after the manner of the times, when suddenly Lamartine appeared\non the scene with Ledru-Rollin and a captain in the artillery. The\nfollowing dialogue then took place:\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"A member of the Provisional Government.\"\n\n\"Of the Government of yesterday or of to-day?\"\n\n\"Of the one of to-day.\"\n\n\"In that case I arrest you.\"\n\nBarbes was taken to Vincennes. He had been free rather less than\nthree months, when he returned to prison as though it were his natural\ndwelling-place.\n\nGeorge Sand admired him just as much after this as before. For her, the\ngreat man of the Revolution was neither Ledru-Rollin, Lamartine, nor\neven Louis-Blanc; it was Barbes. She compared him to Joan of Arc and to\nRobespierre. To her, he was much more than a mere statesman, this man of\nconspiracies and dungeons, ever mysterious and unfortunate, always\nready for a drama or a romance. In her heart she kept an altar for this\nmartyr, and never thought of wondering whether, after all, this idol and\nhero were not a mere puppet.\n\nThe skirmish of May 15 undeceived George Sand very considerably. The\nJune insurrection and the civil war, with blood flowing in the Paris\nstreets, those streets which were formerly so lively and amusing, caused\nher terrible grief. From henceforth her letters were full of her sadness\nand discouragement. The most gloomy depression took the place of her\nformer enthusiasm. It had only required a few weeks for this change to\ntake place. In February she had been so proud of France, and now she\nfelt that she was to be pitied for being a Frenchwoman. It was all\nso sad, and she was so ashamed. There was no one to count upon now.\nLamartine was a chatterer; Ledru-Rollin was like a woman; the people\nwere ignorant and ungrateful, so that the mission of literary people was\nover. She therefore took refuge in fiction, and buried herself in her\ndreams of art. We are not sorry to follow her there.\n\n_Francois le Champi_ appeared as a serial in the _Journal des Debats_.\nThe _denouement_ was delayed by another _denouement_, which the public\nfound still more interesting. This was nothing less than the catastrophe\nof the July Monarchy, in February, 1848.\n\nAfter the terrible June troubles, George Sand had been heartbroken, and\nhad turned once more to literature for consolation. She wrote _La Petite\nFadette_, so that the pastoral romances and the Revolution are closely\nconnected with each other. Beside the novels of this kind which we have\nalready mentioned, we must add _Jeanne_, which dates from 1844, and\nthe _Maitres Sonneurs_, written in 1853. This, then, completes the\nincomparable series, which was the author's _chef-d'oeuvre_, and one of\nthe finest gems of French literature. This was George Sand's real style,\nand the note in literature which was peculiarly her own. She was\nwell fitted for such writing, both by her natural disposition and by\ncircumstances. She had lived nearly all her life in the country, and it\nwas there only that she lived to the full. She made great efforts, but\nParis certainly made her homesick for her beloved Berry. She could\nnot help sighing when she thought of the ploughed fields, of the\nwalnut-trees, and of the oxen answering to the voice of the labourers.\n\n\"It is no use,\" she wrote about the same time, \"if you are born a\ncountry person, you cannot get used to the noise of cities. It always\nseems to me that our mud is beautiful mud, whilst that here makes me\nfeel sick. I very much prefer my keeper's wit to that of certain of the\nvisitors here. It seems to me that I am livelier when I have eaten some\nof Nannette's wheat-cake than I am after my coffee in Paris. In short,\nit appears to me that we are all perfect and charming, that no one could\nbe more agreeable than we are, and that Parisians are all clowns.\"(46)\n\n     (46) _Correspondance:_ To.  Ch.  Duvernet, November 12, 1842.\n\nThis was said in all sincerity. George Sand was quite indifferent about\nall the great events of Parisian life, about social tittle-tattle and\nBoulevard gossip. She knew the importance, though, of every episode of\ncountry life, of a sudden fog or of the overflowing of the river. She\nknew the place well, too, as she had visited every nook and corner in\nall weathers and in every season. She knew all the people; there was\nnot a house she had not entered, either to visit the sick or to clear\nup some piece of business for the inmates. Not only did she like the\ncountry and the country people because she was accustomed to everything\nthere, but she had something of the nature of these people within her.\nShe had a certain turn of mind that was peasant-like, her slowness to\ntake things in, her dislike of speech when thinking, her thoughts taking\nthe form of \"a series of reveries which gave her a sort of tranquil\necstasy, whether awake or asleep.\"(47) It does not seem as though there\nhas ever been such an _ensemble_ of favourable conditions.\n\n     (47) See in _Jeanne_ a very fine page on the peasant soul.\n\nShe did not succeed in her first attempt. In several of her novels, ever\nsince _Valentine_, she had given us peasants among her characters. She\nhad tried labourers, mole-catchers, fortune-tellers and beggars, but all\nthese were episodic characters. _Jeanne_ is the first novel in which the\nheroine is a peasant. Everything connected with Jeanne herself in the\nnovel is exquisite. We have all seen peasant women of this kind, women\nwith serious faces and clearly-cut features, with a dreamy look in their\neyes that makes us think of the maid of Lorraine. It is one of these\nexceptional creatures that George Sand has depicted. She has made an\necstatic being of her, who welcomes all that is supernatural, utterly\nregardless of dates or epochs. To her all wonderful beings appeal,\nthe Virgin Mary and fairies, Druidesses, Joan of Arc and Napoleon. But\nJeanne, the Virgin of Ep Nell, the Velleda of the Jomatres stones, the\nmystical sister of the Great Shepherdess, was very poorly supported.\nThis remark does not refer to her cousin Claudie, although this\nindividual's conduct was not blameless. Jeanne had gone into service at\nBoussac, and she was surrounded by a group of middle-class people, among\nwhom was Sir Arthur----, a wealthy Englishman, who wanted to marry her.\nThis mixture of peasants and _bourgeois_ is not a happy one. Neither is\nthe mixture of _patois_ with a more Christian way of talking, or rather\nwith a written style. The author was experimenting and feeling her way.\n\nWhen she wrote _La Mare au Diable_ she had found it, for in this work\nwe have unity of tone, harmony of the characters with their setting,\nof sentiment with the various adventures, and, above all, absolute\nsimplicity.\n\nIn _Francois le Champi_ there is much that is graceful, and there is\nreal feeling mingled with a touch of sentimentality. Madeleine Blanchet\nis rather old for Champi, whom she had brought up like her own child. In\nthe country, though, where difference of age is soon less apparent, the\ndisproportion does not seem as objectionable as it would in city life.\nThe novel is not a study of maternal affection in love, as it is not\nMadeleine's feelings that are analyzed, but those of Francois. For a\nlong time he had been in love without knowing it, and he is only aware\nof it when this love, instead of being a sort of agreeable dream and\nmelancholy pleasure, is transformed into suffering.\n\nThe subject of _La Petite Fadette_ is another analysis of a love which\nhas been silent for a long time. It is difficult to say which is the\nbest of these delightful stories, but perhaps, on the whole, this last\none is generally preferred, on account of the curious and charming\nfigure of little Fadette herself. We can see the thin, slender girl,\nsuddenly appearing on the road, emerging from a thicket. She seems to be\npart of the scenery, and can scarcely be distinguished from the objects\naround her. The little wild country girl is like the spirit of the\nfields, woods, rivers and precipices. She is a being very near to\nNature. Inquisitive and mischievous, she is bold in her speech, because\nshe is treated as a reprobate. She jeers, because she knows that she is\ndetested, and she scratches, because she suffers. The day comes when she\nfeels some of that affection which makes the atmosphere breathable for\nhuman beings. She feels her heart beating faster in her bosom, thanks to\nthis affection, and from that minute a transformation takes place within\nher. Landry, who has been observing her, is of opinion that she must\nbe something of a witch. Landry is very simple-minded. There is no\nwitchcraft here except that of love, and it was not difficult for that\nto work the metamorphosis. It has worked many others in this world.\n\nThe _Maitres Soneurs_ initiates us into forest life, so full of\nmysterious visions. In opposition to the sedentary, stay-at-home life\nof the inhabitant of plains, with his indolent mind, we have the\nfree-and-easy humour of the handsome and adventurous muleteer, Huriel,\nwith his love of the road and of all that is unexpected. He is a\n_cheminau_ before the days of M. Richepin.\n\nI do not know any stories more finished than these. They certainly prove\nthat George Sand had the artistic sense, a quality which has frequently\nbeen denied her. The characters in these stories are living and active,\nand at the same time their psychology is not insisted upon, and they\ndo not stand out in such relief as to turn our attention from things,\nwhich, as we know, are more important than people in the country. We are\nsurrounded on all sides by the country, and bathed, as it were, in\nits atmosphere. And yet, in spite of all this, the country is not once\ndescribed. There is not one of those descriptions so dear to the heart\nof those who are considered masters in the art of word-painting. We do\nnot describe those things with which we live. We are content to have\nthem ever present in our mind and to be in constant communion with\nthem. Style is, perhaps, the sovereign quality in these stories. Words\npeculiar to the district are introduced just sufficiently to give an\naccent. Somewhat old-fashioned expressions are employed, and these prove\nthe survival of by-gone days, which, in the country, are respected more\nthan elsewhere. Without any apparent effort, the narrative takes that\nepic form so natural to those who, as _aedes_ of primitive epochs, or\nstory-tellers by country firesides, give their testimony about things of\nthe past.\n\nI am aware that George Sand has been accused of tracing portraits of\nher peasants which were not like them. This is so absurd that I do not\nconsider it worth while to spend time in discussing it. It would be so\neasy to show that in her types of peasants there is more variety, and\nalso more reality, than in Balzac's more realistic ones. Without being\nuntruthful portraits, it may be that they are somewhat flattered, and\nthat we have more honest, delicate and religious peasants in these\nstories than in reality. This may be so, and George Sand warns us of\nthis herself. It was her intention to depict them thus.\n\nIt was not absolute reality and the everyday details of the peasants'\nhabits and customs that she wanted to show us, but the poetry of the\ncountry, the reflection of the great sights of Nature in the soul of\nthose who, thanks to their daily work, are the constant witnesses of\nthem. The peasant certainly has no exact notion of the poetry of Nature,\nnor is he always conscious of it. He feels it, though, within his soul\nin a vague way. At certain moments he has glimpses of it, perhaps, when\nlove causes him emotion, or perhaps when he is absent from the part of\nthe world, where he has always lived. His homesickness then gives him a\nkeener perception. This poetry is perhaps never clearly revealed to any\nindividual, not to the labourer who traces out his furrows tranquilly in\nthe early morning, nor to the shepherd who spends whole weeks alone in\nthe mountains, face to face with the stars. It dwells, though, in the\ninner conscience of the race. The generations which come and go have it\nwithin them, and they do not fall to express it. It is this poetry\nwhich we find in certain customs and beliefs, in the various legends and\nsongs. When Le Champi returns to his native place, he finds the whole\ncountry murmuring with the twitter of birds which he knew so well.\n\n\"And all this reminded him of a very old song with which his mother\nZabelli used to sing him to sleep. It was a song with words such as\npeople used to employ in olden times.\"\n\nIn George Sand's pastoral novels we have some of these old words.\nThey come to us from afar, and are like a supreme blossoming of old\ntraditions.\n\nIt is all this which characterizes these books, and assigns to them\ntheir place in our literature. We must not compare them with the rugged\nstudies of Balzac, nor with the insipid compositions of the bucolic\nwriter, nor even with Bernadin de Saint-Pierre's masterpiece, as there\nare too many cocoanut trees in that. They prevent us seeing the French\nlandscapes. Very few people know the country in France and the humble\npeople who dwell there. Very few writers have loved the country well\nenough to be able to depict its hidden charms.\n\nLa Fontaine has done it in his fables and Perrault in his tales. George\nSand has her place, in this race of writers, among the French Homers.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nTHE 'BONNE DAME' OF NOHANT THE THEATRE--ALEXANDRE DUMAS FILS--LIFE AT\nNOHANT\n\n\nNovelists are given to speaking of the theatre somewhat disdainfully.\nThey say that there is too much convention, that an author is too much\nthe slave of material conditions, and is obliged to consider the taste\nof the crowd, whilst a book appeals to the lover of literature, who can\nread it by his own fireside, and to the society woman, who loses herself\nin its pages. As soon, though, as one of their novels has had more\nsuccess than its predecessors, they do not hesitate to cut it up into\nslices, according to the requirements of the publishing house, so that\nit may go beyond the little circle of lovers of literature and society\nwomen and reach the crowd--the largest crowd possible.\n\nGeorge Sand never pretended to have this immense disdain for the theatre\nwhich is professed by ultra-refined writers. She had always loved the\ntheatre, and she bore it no grudge, although her pieces had been hissed.\nIn those days plays that did not find favour were hissed. At present\nthey are not hissed, either because there are no more poor plays,\nor because the public has seen so many bad ones that it has become\nphilosophical, and does not take the trouble to show its displeasure.\nGeorge Sand's first piece, _Cosima_, was a noted failure. About the year\n1850, she turned to the theatre once more, hoping to find a new form of\nexpression for her energy and talent. _Francois le Champi_ was a great\nsuccess. In January, 1851, she wrote as follows, after the performance\nof _Claudie:_ \"A tearful success and a financial one. The house is full\nevery day; not a ticket given away, and not even a seat for Maurice. The\npiece is played admirably; Bocage is magnificent. The public weeps and\nblows its nose, as though it were in church. I am told that never in\nthe memory of man has there been such a first night. I was not present\nmyself.\"\n\nThere may be a slight exaggeration in the words \"never in the memory of\nman,\" but the success was really great. _Claudie_ is still given, and I\nremember seeing Paul Mounet interpret the part of Remy admirably at the\nOdeon Theatre. As to the _Mariage de Victorine_, it figures every year\non the programme of the Conservatoire competitions. It is the typical\npiece for would-be _ingenues._\n\n_Francois le Champi, Claudie_ and the _Mariage de Victorine_ may be\nconsidered as the series representing George Sand's dramatic writings.\nThese pieces were all her own, and, in her own opinion, that was their\nprincipal merit. The dramatic author is frequently obliged to accept the\ncollaboration of persons who know nothing of literature.\n\n\"Your characters say this,\" observes the manager; \"it is all very well,\nbut, believe me, it will be better for him to say just the opposite. The\npiece will run at least sixty nights longer.\" There was a manager at\nthe Gymnase Theatre in those days named Montigny. He was a very clever\nmanager, and knew exactly what the characters ought to say for making\nthe piece run. George Sand complained of his mania for changing every\nplay, and she added: \"Every piece that I did not change, such, for\ninstance, as _Champi_, _Claudie_, _Victorine, Le Demon du foyer_ and _Le\nPressoir_, was a success, whilst all the others were either failures or\nthey had a very short run.\"(48)\n\n     (48) _Correspondance:_ To Maurice Sand, February 24, 1855.\n\nIt was in these pieces that George Sand carried out her own idea of what\nwas required for the theatre. Her idea was very simple. She gives it in\ntwo or three words: \"I like pieces that make me cry.\" She adds: \"I like\ndrama better than comedy, and, like a woman, I must be infatuated by one\nof the characters.\" This character is the congenial one. The public is\nwith him always and trembles for him, and the trembling is all the more\nagreeable, because the public knows perfectly well that all will\nend well for this character. It can even go as far as weeping the\ntraditional six tears, as Madame de Sevigne did for Andromaque. Tears at\nthe theatre are all the sweeter, because they are all in vain. When, in\na play, we have a congenial character who is there from the beginning to\nthe end, the play is a success. Let us take _Cyraino de Bergerac_, for\ninstance, which is one of the greatest successes in the history of the\ntheatre.\n\nFrancois le Champi is eminently a congenial character, for he is a man\nwho always sets wrong things right. We are such believers in justice and\nin the interference of Providence. When good, straightforward people are\npersecuted by fate, we always expect to see a man appear upon the\nscene who will be the champion of innocence, who will put evil-doers to\nrights, and find the proper thing to do and say in every circumstance.\n\nFrancois appears at the house of Madeleine Blanchet, who is a widow and\nvery sad and ill. He takes her part and defends her from the results of\nLa Severe's intrigues. He is hard on the latter, and he disdains another\nwoman, Mariette, but both La Severe and Mariette love him, so true is\nit that women have a weakness for conquerors. Francois only cares for\nMadeleine, though. On the stage, we like a man to be adored by all\nwomen, as this seems to us a guarantee that he will only care for one of\nthem.\n\n\"Champi\" is a word peculiar to a certain district, meaning \"natural\nson.\" Dumas _fils_ wrote a play entitled _Le Fils naturel_. The hero\nis also a superior man, who plays the part of Providence to the family\nwhich has refused to recognize him.\n\nIn _Claudie_, as in _Francois le Champi_, the rural setting is one\nof the great charms of the play. The first act is one of the most\npicturesque scenes on the stage. It takes place in a farmyard, the\nday when the reapers have finished their task, which is just as\nawe-inspiring as that of the sowers. A cart, drawn by oxen, enters the\nyard, bringing a sheaf all adorned with ribbons and flowers. The oldest\nof the labourers, Pere Remy, addresses a fine couplet to the sheaf of\ncorn which has cost so much labour, but which is destined to keep life\nin them all. Claudie is one of those young peasant girls, whom we met\nwith in the novel entitled _Jeanne_. She had been unfortunate, but\nJeanne, although virtuous and pure herself, did not despise her, for in\nthe country there is great latitude in certain matters. This is just the\nplain story, but on the stage everything becomes more dramatic and is\ntreated in a more detailed and solemn fashion. Claudie's misfortune\ncauses her to become a sort of personage apart, and it raises her very\nhigh in her own esteem.\n\n\"I am not afraid of anything that can be said about me,\" observes\nClaudie, \"for, on knowing the truth, kind-hearted, upright people will\nacknowledge that I do not deserve to be insulted.\" Her old grandfather,\nRemy, has completely absolved her.\n\n\"You have repented and suffered enough, and you have worked and wept and\nexpiated enough, too, my poor Claudie,\" he says. Through all this she\nhas become worthy to make an excellent marriage. It is a case of\nthat special moral code by which, after free love, the fault must be\nrecompensed.\n\nClaudie is later on the Jeannine of the _Idees de Madame Aubray_,\nthe Denise of Alexandre Dumas. She is the unmarried mother, whose\nmisfortunes have not crushed her pride, who, after being outraged, has\na right now to a double share of respect. The first good young man is\ncalled upon to accept her past life, for there is a law of solidarity in\nthe world. The human species is divided into two categories, the one\nis always busy doing harm, and the other is naturally obliged to give\nitself up to making good the harm done.\n\n_The Mariage de Victorine_ belongs to a well-known kind of literary\nexercise, which was formerly very much in honour in the colleges. This\nconsists in taking a celebrated work at the place where the author has\nleft it and in imagining the \"sequel.\" For instance, after the _Cid_,\nthere would be the marriage of Rodrigue and Chimene for us. As a\ncontinuation of _L'Ecole des Femmes_, there is the result of the\nmarriage of the young Horace with the tiresome little Agnes. Corneille\ngave a sequel to the _Menteur_ himself. Fabre d'Eglantine wrote the\nsequel to _Le Misanthrope_, and called it _Le Philinte de Moliere_.\nGeorge Sand gives us here the sequel of Sedaine's _chef-d'oeuvre_ (that\nis, a _chef-d'oeuvre_ for Sedaine), _Le Philosophe sans le savor._\n\nIn _Le Philosophe sans le savoir_ Monsieur Vanderke is a nobleman, who\nhas become a merchant in order to be in accordance with the ideas of\nthe times. He is a Frenchman, but he has taken a Dutch name out of\nsnobbishness. He has a clerk or a confidential servant named Antoine.\nVictorine is Antoine's daughter. Vanderke's son is to fight a duel, and\nfrom Victorine's emotion, whilst awaiting the result of this duel, it is\neasy to see that she is in love with this young man. George Sand's\nplay turns on the question of what is to be done when the day comes for\nVictorine to marry. An excellent husband is found for her, a certain\nFulgence, one of Monsieur Vanderke's clerks. He belongs to her own\nclass, and this is considered one of the indispensable conditions for\nhappiness in marriage. He loves her, so that everything seems to favour\nVictorine. We are delighted, and she, too, seems to be in good spirits,\nbut, all the time that she is receiving congratulations and presents, we\nbegin to see that she has some great trouble.\n\n\"Silk and pearls!\" she exclaims; \"oh, how heavy they are, but I am sure\nthat they are very fine. Lace, too, and silver; oh, such a quantity of\nsilver. How rich and fine and happy I shall be. And then Fulgence is so\nfond of me.\" (She gets sadder and sadder.) \"And father is so pleased.\nHow strange. I feel stifled.\" (She sits down in Antoine's chair.) \"Is\nthis joy? . . . I feel . . . Ah, it hurts to be as happy as this. . . .\"\nShe bursts into tears. This suppressed emotion to which she finally\ngives vent, and this forced smile which ends in sobs are very effective\non the stage. The question is, how can Victorine's tears be dried? She\nwants to marry young Vanderke, the son of her father's employer, instead\nof the clerk. The only thing is, then, to arrange this marriage.\n\n\"Is it a crime, then, for my brother to love Victorine?\" asks Sophie,\n\"and is it mad of me to think that you will give your consent?\"\n\n\"My dear Sophie,\" replies Monsieur Vanderke, \"there are no unequal\nmarriages in the sight of God. A servitor like Antoine is a friend, and\nI have always brought you up to consider Victorine as your companion and\nequal.\"\n\nThis is the way the father of the family speaks. Personally, I consider\nhim rather imprudent.\n\nAs this play is already a sequel to another one, I do not wish to\npropose a sequel to _Le Mariage de Victorine_, but I cannot help\nwondering what will happen when Vanderke's son finds himself the\nson-in-law of an old servant-man, and also what will occur if he should\ntake his wife to call on some of his sister's friends. It seems to me\nthat he would then find out he had, made a mistake. Among the various\npersonages, only one appears to me quite worthy of interest, and that is\npoor Fulgence, who was so straightforward and honest, and who is treated\nso badly.\n\nBut how deep Victorine was! Even if we admit that she did not\ndeliberately scheme and plot to get herself married by the son of the\nfamily, she did instinctively all that had to be done for that. She was\nvery deep in an innocent way, and I have come to the conclusion that\nsuch deepness is the most to be feared.\n\nI see quite well all that is lacking in these pieces, and that they are\nnot very great, but all the same they form a \"theatre\" apart. There is\nunity in this theatrical work of George Sand. Whether it makes a hero of\nthe natural son, rehabilitates the seduced girl, or cries down the idea\nof _mesalliances_, it is always the same fight in which it is\nengaged; it is always fighting against the same enemies, prejudice and\nnarrow-mindedness. On the stage, we call every opinion contrary to our\nown prejudice or narrow-mindedness. The theatre lives by fighting.\nIt matters little what the author is attacking. He may wage war with\nprinciples, prejudices, giants, or windmills. Provided that there be a\nbattle, there will be a theatre for it.\n\nThe fact that George Sand's theatre was the forerunner of the theatre\nof Dumas _fils_ gives it additional value. We have already noticed the\nanalogy of situations and the kinship of theories contained in George\nSand's best plays and in the most noted ones by Dumas. I have no doubt\nthat Dumas owed a great deal to George Sand. We shall see that he paid\nhis debt as only he could have done. He knew the novelist when he was\nquite young, as Dumas _pere_ and George Sand were on very friendly\nterms. In her letter telling Sainte-Beuve not to take Musset to call\non her, as she thought him impertinent, she tells him to bring Dumas\n_pere_, whom she evidently considered well bred. As she was a friend of\nhis father's, she was like a mother for the son. The first letter to him\nin the _Correspondance_ is dated 1850. Dumas _fils_ was then twenty-six\nyears of age, and she calls him \"my son.\"\n\nHe had not written _La Dame aux Camelias_ then. It was performed for\nthe first time in February, 1852. He was merely the author of a few\nsecond-rate novels and of a volume of execrable poetry. He had not found\nout his capabilities at that time. There is no doubt that he was greatly\nstruck by George Sand's plays, imbued as they were with the ideas we\nhave just pointed out.\n\nAll this is worthy of note, as it is essential for understanding the\nwork of Alexandre Dumas _fils_. He, too, was a natural son, and his\nillegitimate birth had caused him much suffering. He was sent to\nthe Pension Goubaux, and for several years he endured the torture\nhe describes with such harshness at the beginning of _L'Affaire\nClemenceau_. He was exposed to all kinds of insults and blows. His first\ncontact with society taught him that this society was unjust, and that\nit made the innocent suffer. The first experience he had was that of the\ncruelty and cowardice of men. His mind was deeply impressed by this,\nand he never lost the impression. He did not forgive, but made it his\nmission to denounce the pharisaical attitude of society. His idea was to\ntreat men according to their merits, and to pay them back for the blows\nhe had received as a child.(49) It is easy, therefore, to understand how\nthe private grievances of Dumas _fils_ had prepared his mind to welcome\na theatre which took the part of the oppressed and waged war with social\nprejudices. I am fully aware of the difference in temperament of the two\nwriters. Dumas _fils_, with his keen observation, was a pessimist. He\ndespised woman, and he advises us to kill her, under the pretext that\nshe has always remained \"the strumpet of the land of No.\" although she\nmay be dressed in a Worth costume and wear a Reboux hat.\n\n     (49) See our study of Dumas _fils_ in a volume entitled _Portraits\n     d'ecrivains._\n\nAs a dramatic author, Alexandre Dumas _fils_ had just what George\nSand lacked. He was vigorous, he had the art of brevity and brilliant\ndialogue. It is thanks to all this that we have one of the masterpieces\nof the French theatre, _Le Marquis de Villemer_, as a result of their\ncollaboration.\n\nWe know from George Sand's letters the share that Dumas _fils_ had in\nthis work. He helped her to take the play from her novel, and to write\nthe scenario. After this, when once the play was written, he touched\nup the dialogue, putting in more emphasis and brilliancy. It was Dumas,\ntherefore, who constructed the play. We all know how careless George\nSand was with her composition. She wrote with scarcely any plan in her\nmind beforehand, and let herself be carried away by events. Dumas'\nidea was that the _denouement_ is a mathematical total, and that before\nwriting the first word of a piece the author must know the end and have\ndecided the action. Theatrical managers complained of the sadness of\nGeorge Sand's plays. It is to Dumas that we owe the gaiety of the Duc\nd'Aleria's _role_. It is one continual flow of amusing speeches, and it\nsaves the piece from the danger of falling into tearful drama. George\nSand had no wit, and Dumas _fils_ was full of it. It was he who put into\nthe dialogue those little sayings which are so easily recognized as his.\n\n\"What do the doctors say?\" is asked, and the reply comes:\n\n\"What do the doctors say? Well, they say just what they know: they say\nnothing.\"\n\n\"My brother declares that the air of Paris is the only air he can\nbreathe,\" says another character.\n\n\"Congratulate him for me on his lungs,\" remarks his interlocutor.\n\n\"Her husband was a baron . . .\" remarks some one.\n\n\"Who is not a baron at present?\" answers another person.\n\nA certain elderly governess is being discussed.\n\n\"Did you not know her?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle Artemise? No, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen an albatross?\"\n\n\"No, never.\"\n\n\"Not even stuffed? Oh, you should go to the Zoo. It is a curious\ncreature, with its great beak ending in a hook. . . . It eats all day\nlong. . . . Well, Mademoiselle Artemise, etc. . . .\"\n\nThe _Marquis de Villemer_ is in its place in the series of George Sand's\nplays, and is quite in accordance with the general tone of her theatre.\nIt is like the _Mariage de Victorine_ over again. This time Victorine is\na reader, who gets herself married by a Marquis named Urbain. He is of a\ngloomy disposition, so that she will not enjoy his society much, but she\nwill be a Marquise. Victorine and Caroline are both persons who know how\nto make their way in the world. When they have a son, I should be very\nmuch surprised if they allowed him to make a _mesalliance_.\n\nGeorge Sand was one of the persons f or whom Dumas _fils_ had the\ngreatest admiration. As a proof of this, a voluminous correspondence\nbetween them exists. It has not yet been published, but there is a\npossibility that it may be some day. I remember, when talking with Dumas\n_fils_, the terms in which he always spoke of \"la mere Sand,\" as he\ncalled her in a familiar but filial way. He compared her to his father,\nand that was great praise indeed from him. He admired in her, too, as\nhe admired in his father, that wealth of creative power and immense\ncapacity for uninterrupted work. As a proof of this admiration, we have\nonly to turn to the preface to _Le Fils naturel_, in which Dumas is so\nfurious with the inhabitants of Palaiseau. George Sand had taken up her\nabode at Palaiseau, and Dumas had been trying in vain to discover her\naddress in the district, when he came across one of the natives, who\nreplied as follows: \"George Sand? Wait a minute. Isn't it a lady with\npapers?\" \"So much for the glory,\" concludes Dumas, \"of those of us with\npapers.\" According to him, no woman had ever had more talent or as much\ngenius. \"She thinks like Montaigne,\" he says, \"she dreams like Ossian\nand she writes like Jean-Jacques. Leonardo sketches her phrases for her,\nand Mozart sings them. Madame de Sevigne kisses her hands, and Madame de\nStael kneels down to her as she passes.\" We can scarcely imagine Madame\nde Stael in this humble posture, but one of the charms of Dumas was his\ngenerous nature, which spared no praise and was lavish in enthusiasm.\n\n\nAt the epoch at which we have now arrived, George Sand had commenced\nthat period of tranquillity and calm in which she was to spend the rest\nof her life. She had given up politics, for, as we have seen, she was\nquickly undeceived with regard to them, and cured of her illusions. When\nthe _coup d'etat_ of December, 1851, took place, George Sand, who had\nbeen Ledru-Rollin's collaborator and a friend of Barbes, soon made up\nher mind what to do. As the daughter of Murat's _aide-de-camp_, she\nnaturally had a certain sympathy with the Bonapartists. Napoleon III was\na socialist, so that it was possible to come to an understanding. When\nthe prince had been a prisoner at Ham, he had sent the novelist his\nstudy entitled _L'Extinction du pauperisme_. George Sand took advantage\nof her former intercourse with him to beg for his indulgrence in favour\nof some of her friends. This time she was in her proper _role_, the\n_role_ of a woman. The \"tyrant\" granted the favours she asked, and\nGeorge Sand then came to the conclusion that he was a good sort of\ntyrant. She was accused of treason, but she nevertheless continued\nto speak of him with gratitude. She remained on good terms with the\nImperial family, particularly with Prince Jerome, as she appreciated\nhis intellect. She used to talk with him on literary and philosophical\nquestions. She sent him two tapestry ottomans one year, which she had\nworked for him. Her son Maurice went for a cruise to America on Prince\nJerome's yacht, and he was the godfather of George Sand's little\ngrandchildren who were baptized as Protestants.\n\nGeorge Sand deserves special mention for her science in the art of\ngrowing old. It is not a science easy to master, and personally this is\none of my reasons for admiring her. She understood what a charm there is\nin that time of life when the voice of the passions is no longer heard,\nso that we can listen to the voice of things and examine the lesson\nof life, that time when our reason makes us more indulgent, when the\nsadness of earthly separations is softened by the thought that we shall\nsoon go ourselves to join those who have left us. We then begin to have\na foretaste of the calmness of that Great Sleep which is to console us\nat the end of all our sufferings and grief. George Sand was fully aware\nof the change that had taken place within her. She said, several\ntimes over, that the age of impersonality had arrived for her. She was\ndelighted at having escaped from herself and at being free from egoism.\nFrom henceforth she could give herself up to the sentiments which, in\npedantic and barbarous jargon, are called altruistic sentiments. By this\nwe mean motherly and grandmotherly affection, devotion to her family,\nand enthusiasm for all that is beautiful and noble. She was delighted\nwhen she was told of a generous deed, and charmed by a book in which she\ndiscovered talent. It seemed to her as though she were in some way joint\nauthor of it.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all that I see dawning or growing . . .\" she\nwrote, at this time. \"When we see or read anything beautiful, does it\nnot seem as though it belongs to us in a way, that it is neither\nyours nor mine, but that it belongs to all who drink from it and are\nstrengthened by it?\"(50)\n\n     (50) _Correspondance:_ To Octave Feuillet, February 27, 1859.\n\nThis is a noble sentiment, and less rare than is generally believed.\nThe public little thinks that it is one of the great joys of the\nwriter, when he has reached a certain age, to admire the works of his\nfellow-writers. George Sand encouraged her young _confreres_, Dumas\n_fils_, Feuillet and Flaubert, at the beginning of their career, and\nhelped them with her advice.\n\nWe have plenty of information about her at this epoch. Her intimate\nfriends, inquisitive people and persons passing through Paris,\nhave described their visits to her over and over again. We have the\nimpressions noted down by the Goncourt brothers in their _Journal_. We\nall know how much to trust to this diary. Whenever the Goncourts give\nus an idea, an opinion, or a doctrine, it is as well to be wary in\naccepting it. They were not very intelligent. I do not wish, in saying\nthis, to detract from them, but merely to define them. On the other\nhand, what they saw, they saw thoroughly, and they noted the general\nlook, the attitude or gesture with great care.\n\nWe give their impressions of George Sand. In March, 1862, they went to\ncall on her. She was then living in Paris, in the Rue Racine. They give\nan account of this visit in their diary.\n\n\"_March_ 30, 1862.\n\n\"On the fourth floor, No. 2, Rue Racine. A little gentleman, very\nmuch like every one else, opened the door to us. He smiled, and said:\n'Messieurs de Goncourt!' and then, opening another door, showed us into\na very large room, a kind of studio.\n\n\"There was a window at the far end, and the light was getting dim, for\nit was about five o'clock. We could see a grey shadow against the pale\nlight. It was a woman, who did not attempt to rise, but who remained\nimpassive to our bow and our words. This seated shadow, looking so\ndrowsy, was Madame Sand, and the man who opened the door was the\nengraver Manceau. Madame Sand is like an automatic machine. She talks in\na monotonous, mechanical voice which she neither raises nor lowers,\nand which is never animated. In her whole attitude there is a sort of\ngravity and placidness, something of the half-asleep air of a person\nruminating. She has very slow gestures, the gestures of a somnambulist.\nWith a mechanical movement she strikes a wax match, which gives a\nflicker, and lights the cigar she is holding between her lips.\n\n\"Madame Sand was extremely pleasant; she praised us a great deal, but\nwith a childishness of ideas, a platitude of expression and a mournful\ngood-naturedness that was as chilling as the bare wall of a room.\nManceau endeavoured to enliven the dialogue. We talked of her theatre\nat Nohant, where they act for her and for her maid until four in the\nmorning. . . . We then talked of her prodigious faculty for work. She\ntold us that there was nothing meritorious in that, as she had always\nworked so easily. She writes every night from one o'clock until four in\nthe morning, and she writes again for about two hours during the day.\nManceau explains everything, rather like an exhibitor of phenomena. 'It\nis all the same to her,' he told us, 'if she is disturbed. Suppose you\nturn on a tap at your house, and some one comes in the room. You simply\nturn the tap off. It is like that with Madame Sand.'\"\n\n\nThe Goncourt brothers were extremely clever in detracting from the\nmerits of the people about whom they spoke. They tell us that George\nSand had \"a childishness in her ideas and a platitude of expression.\"\nThey were unkind without endeavouring to be so. They ran down people\ninstinctively. They were eminently literary men. They were also artistic\nwriters, and had even invented \"artistic writing,\" but they had very\nlittle in common with George Sand's attitude of mind. To her the theory\nof art for the sake of art had always seemed a very hollow theory. She\nwrote as well as she could, but she never dreamed of the profession of\nwriting having anything in common with an acrobatic display.\n\nIn September, 1863, the Goncourt brothers again speak of George Sand,\ntelling us about her life at Nohant, or rather putting the account they\ngive into the mouth of Theophile Gautier. He had just returned from\nNohant, and he was asked if it was amusing at George Sand's.\n\n\"Just as amusing as a monastery of the Moravian brotherhood,\" he\nreplies. \"I arrived there in the evening, and the house is a long way\nfrom the station. My trunk was put into a thicket, and on arriving\nI entered by the farm in the midst of all the dogs, which gave me a\nfright. . . .\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, Gautier's arrival at Nohant had been quite a\ndramatic poem, half tragic and half comic. Absolute freedom was the rule\nof Nohant. Every one there read, wrote, or went to sleep according\nto his own will and pleasure. Gautier arrived in that frame of mind\npeculiar to the Parisian of former days. He considered that he had given\na proof of heroism in venturing outside the walls of Paris. He therefore\nexpected a hearty welcome. He was very much annoyed at his reception,\nand was about to start back again immediately, when George Sand was\ninformed of his arrival. She was extremely vexed at what had happened,\nand exclaimed, \"But had not any one told him how stupid I am!\"\n\nThe Goncourt brothers asked Gautier what life at Nohant was like.\n\n\"Luncheon is at ten,\" he replied, \"and when the finger was on the hour,\nwe all took our seats. Madame Sand arrived, looking like a somnambulist,\nand remained half asleep all through the meal. After luncheon we went\ninto the garden and played at _cochonnet_. This roused her, and she\nwould then sit down and begin to talk.\"\n\nIt would have been more exact to say that she listened, as she was not\na great talker herself. She had a horror of a certain kind of\nconversation, of that futile, paradoxical and spasmodic kind which is\nthe speciality of \"brilliant talkers.\" Sparkling conversation of this\nsort disconcerted her and made her feel ill at ease. She did not\nlike the topic to be the literary profession either. This exasperated\nGautier, who would not admit of there being anything else in the world\nbut literature.\n\n\"At three o'clock,\" he continued, \"Madame Sand went away to write until\nsix. We then dined, but we had to dine quickly, so that Marie Caillot\nwould have time to dine. Marie Caillot is the servant, a sort of little\nFadette whom Madame Sand had discovered in the neighbourhood for playing\nher pieces. This Marie Caillot used to come into the drawing-room in the\nevening. After dinner Madame Sand would play patience, without uttering\na word, until midnight. . . . At midnight she began to write again until\nfour o'clock. . . . You know what happened once. Something monstrous.\nShe finished a novel at one o'clock in the morning, and began another\nduring the night. . . . To make copy is a function with Madame Sand.\"\n\nThe marionette theatre was one of the Nohant amusements. One of the joys\nof the family, and also one of the delights of _dilettanti_,(51) was the\npainting of the scenery, the manufacturing of costumes, the working out\nof scenarios, dressing dolls and making them talk.\n\n     (51) \"The individual named George Sand is very well.  He is\n     enjoying the wonderful winter which reigns in Berry; he\n     gathers flowers, points out any interesting botanical\n     anomalies, sews dresses and mantles for his daughter-in-law,\n     and costumes for the marionettes, cuts out stage scenery,\n     dresses dolls and reads music. . ..\"--_Correspondance:_ To\n     Flaubert, January 17, 1869.\n\nIn one of her novels, published in 1857, George Sand introduces to us\na certain Christian Waldo, who has a marionette show. He explains\nthe attraction of this kind of theatre and the fascination of these\n_burattini_, which were living beings to him. Those among us who, some\nfifteen years ago, were infatuated by a similar show, are not surprised\nat Waldo's words. The marionettes to which we refer were to be seen in\nthe Passage Vivienne. Sacred plays in verse were given, and the managers\nwere Monsieur Richepin and Monsieur Bouchor. For such plays we preferred\nactors made of wood to actors of flesh and blood, as there is always a\ncertain desecration otherwise in acting such pieces.\n\nGeorge Sand rarely left Nohant now except for her little flat in Paris.\nIn the spring of 1855, she went to Rome for a short time, but did not\nenjoy this visit much. She sums up her impressions in the following\nwords: \"Rome is a regular see-saw.\" The ruins did not interest her much.\n\n\"After spending several days in visiting urns, tombs, crypts and\ncolumns, one feels the need of getting out of all this a little and of\nseeing Nature.\"\n\nNature, however, did not compensate her sufficiently for her\ndisappointment in the ruins.\n\n\"The Roman Campagna, which has been so much vaunted, is certainly\nsingularly immense, but it is so bare, flat and deserted, so monotonous\nand sad, miles and miles of meadow-land in every direction, that the\nlittle brain one has left, after seeing the city, is almost overpowered\nby it all.\"\n\nThis journey inspired her with one of the weakest of her novels, _La\nDaniella_. It is the diary of a painter named Jean Valreg, who married\na laundry-girl. In 1861, after an illness, she went to Tamaris, in the\nsouth of France. This name is the title of one of her novels. She does\nnot care for this place either. She considers that there is too much\nwind, too much dust, and that there are too many olive-trees in the\nsouth of France.\n\nI am convinced that at an earlier time in her life she would, have been\nwon over by the fascination of Rome. She had comprehended the charm of\nVenice so admirably. At an earlier date, too, she would not have\nbeen indifferent to the beauties of Provence, as she had delighted in\nmeridional Nature when in Majorca.\n\nThe years were over, though, for her to enjoy the variety of outside\nshows with all their phantasmagoria. A time comes in life, and it had\nalready come for her, when we discover that Nature, which has seemed so\nvaried, is the same everywhere, that we have quite near us all that we\nhave been so far away to seek, a little of this earth, a little water\nand a little sky. We find, too, that we have neither the time nor the\ninclination to go away in search of all this when our hours are counted\nand we feel the end near. The essential thing then is to reserve for\nourselves a little space for our meditations, between the agitations of\nlife and that moment which alone decides everything for us.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nTHE GENIUS OF THE WRITER\n\nCORRESPONDENCE WITH FLAUBERT--LAST NOVELS\n\n\nWith that maternal instinct which was so strong within her, George Sand\ncould not do without having a child to scold, direct and take to task.\nThe one to whom she was to devote the last ten years of her life, who\nneeded her beneficent affection more than any of those she had adopted,\nwas a kind of giant with hair turned back from his forehead and a thick\nmoustache like a Norman of the heroic ages. He was just such a man as\nwe can imagine the pirates in Duc Rollo's boats. This descendant of the\nVikings had been born in times of peace, and his sole occupation was to\nendeavour to form harmonious phrases by avoiding assonances.\n\nI do not think there have been two individuals more different from each\nother than George Sand and Gustave Flaubert. He was an artist, and she\nin many respects was _bourgeoise_. He saw all things at their worst;\nshe saw them better than they were. Flaubert wrote to her in surprise\nas follows: \"In spite of your large sphinx eyes, you have seen the world\nthrough gold colour.\"\n\nShe loved the lower classes; he thought them detestable, and qualified\nuniversal suffrage as \"a disgrace to the human mind.\" She preached\nconcord, the union of classes, whilst he gave his opinion as follows:\n\n\"I believe that the poor hate the rich, and that the rich are afraid of\nthe poor. It will be like this eternally.\"\n\nIt was always thus. On every subject the opinion of the one was sure to\nbe the direct opposite of the opinion of the other. This was just what\nhad attracted them.\n\n\"I should not be interested in myself,\" George Sand said, \"if I had the\nhonour of meeting myself.\" She was interested in Flaubert, as she had\ndivined that he was her antithesis.\n\n\"The man who is Just passing,\" says Fantasio, \"is charming. There are\nall sorts of ideas in his mind which would be quite new to me.\"\n\nGeorge Sand wanted to know something of these ideas which were new to\nher. She admired Flaubert on account of all sorts of qualities which\nshe did not possess herself. She liked him, too, as she felt that he was\nunhappy.\n\nShe went to see him during the summer of 1866. They visited the historic\nstreets and old parts of Rouen together. She was both charmed and\nsurprised. She could not believe her eyes, as she had never imagined\nthat all that existed, and so near Paris, too. She stayed in that house\nat Croisset in which Flaubert's whole life was spent. It was a house\nwith wide windows and a view over the Seine. The hoarse, monotonous\nsound of the chain towing the heavy boats along could be heard\ndistinctly within the rooms. Flaubert lived there with his mother and\nniece. To George Sand everything there seemed to breathe of tranquillity\nand comfort, but at the same time she brought away with her an\nimpression of sadness. She attributed this to the vicinity of the Seine,\ncoming and going as it does according to the bar.\n\n\"The willows of the islets are always being covered and uncovered,\" she\nwrites; \"it all looks very cold and sad.\"(52)\n\n     (52) _Correspondance:_ To Maurice Sand, August 10, 1866.\n\nShe was not really duped, though, by her own explanation. She knew\nperfectly well that what makes a house sad or gay, warm or icy-cold is\nnot the outlook on to the surrounding country, but the soul of those who\ninhabit it and who have fashioned it in their own image. She had just\nbeen staying in the house of the misanthropist.\n\nWhen Moliere put the misanthropist on the stage with his\nwretched-looking face, he gave him some of the features which remind\nus so strongly of Flaubert. The most ordinary and everyday events were\nalways enough to put Alceste into a rage. It was just the same with\nFlaubert. Everyday things which we are philosophical enough to accept\ntook his breath away. He was angry, and he wanted to be angry. He was\nirritated with every one and with everything, and he cultivated this\nirritation. He kept himself in a continual state of exasperation,\nand this was his normal state. In his letters he described himself as\n\"worried with life,\" \"disgusted with everything,\" \"always agitated and\nalways indignant.\" He spells _hhhindignant_ with several h's. He signs\nhis letters, \"The Reverend Father Cruchard of the Barnabite Order,\ndirector of the Ladies of Disenchantment.\" Added to all this, although\nthere may have been a certain amount of pose in his attitude, he was\nsincere. He \"roared\" in his own study, when he was quite alone and\nthere was no one to be affected by his roaring. He was organized in a\nremarkable way for suffering. He was both romantic and realistic, a keen\nobserver and an imaginative man. He borrowed some of the most pitiful\ntraits from reality, and recomposed them into a regular nightmare. We\nagree with Flaubert that injustice and nonsense do exist in life. But he\ngives us Nonsense itself, the seven-headed and ten-horned beast of the\nApocalypse. He sees this beast everywhere, it haunts him and blocks up\nevery avenue for him, so that he cannot see the sublime beauties of the\ncreation nor the splendour of human intelligence.\n\nIn reply to all his wild harangues, George Sand gives wise answers,\nsmiling as she gives them, and using her common sense with which to\nprotect herself against the trickery of words. What has he to complain\nof, this grown-up child who is too naive and who expects too much? By\nwhat extraordinary misfortune has he such an exceptionally unhappy lot?\nHe is fairly well off and he has great talent. How many people would\nenvy him! He complains of life, such as it is for every one, and of the\npresent conditions of life, which had never been better for any one at\nany epoch. What is the use of getting irritated with life, since we do\nnot wish to die? Humanity seemed despicable to him, and he hated it.\nWas he not a part of this humanity himself? Instead of cursing our\nfellow-men for a whole crowd of imperfections inherent to their nature,\nwould it not be more just to pity them for such imperfections? As to\nstupidity and nonsense, if he objected to them, it would be better to\npay no attention to them, instead of watching out for them all the time.\nBeside all this, is there not more reason than we imagine for every one\nof us to be indulgent towards the stupidity of other people?\n\n\"That poor stupidity of which we hear so much,\" exclaimed George Sand.\n\"I do not dislike it, as I look on it with maternal eyes.\" The human\nrace is absurd, undoubtedly, but we must own that we contribute\nourselves to this absurdity.\n\nThere is something morbid in Flaubert's case, and with equal clearness\nof vision George Sand points out to him the cause of it and the remedy.\nThe morbidness is caused in the first place by his loneliness, and by\nthe fact that he has severed all bonds which united him to the rest\nof the universe. Woe be to those who are alone! The remedy is the next\nconsideration. Is there not, somewhere in the world, a woman whom he\ncould love and who would make him suffer? Is there not a child somewhere\nwhose father he could imagine himself to be, and to whom he could devote\nhimself? Such is the law of life. Existence is intolerable to us as long\nas we only ask for our own personal satisfaction, but it becomes dear to\nus from the day when we make a present of it to another human being.\n\nThere was the same antagonism in their literary opinions. Flaubert\nwas an artist, the theorist of the doctrine of art for art, such\nas Theophile Gautier, the Goncourt brothers and the Parnassians\ncomprehended it, at about the same epoch. It is singularly interesting\nto hear him formulate each article of this doctrine, and to hear George\nSand's fervent protestations in reply. Flaubert considers that an author\nshould not put himself into his work, that he should not write his books\nwith his heart, and George Sand answers:\n\n\"I do not understand at all, then. Oh no, it is all incomprehensible to\nme.\"\n\nWith what was an author to write his books, if not with his own\nsentiments and emotions? Was he to write them with the hearts of other\npeople? Flaubert maintained that an author should only write for about\ntwenty persons, unless he simply wrote for himself, \"like a _bourgeois_\nturning his serviette-rings round in his attic.\" George Sand was of\nopinion that an author should write \"for all those who can profit by\ngood reading.\" Flaubert confesses that if attention be paid to the\nold distinction between matter and form, he should give the greater\nimportance to form, in which he had a religious belief. He considered\nthat in the correctness of the putting together, in the rarity of the\nelements, the polish of the surface and the perfect harmony of the whole\nthere was an intrinsic virtue, a kind of divine force. In conclusion, he\nadds:\n\n\"I endeavour to think well always, _in order to_ write well, but I do\nnot conceal the fact that my object is to write well.\"\n\nThis, then, was the secret of that working up of the style, until it\nbecame a mania with him and developed into a torture. We all know of\nthe days of anguish which Flaubert spent in searching for a word that\nescaped him, and the weeks that he devoted to rounding off one of his\nperiods. He would never write these down until he had said them to\nhimself, or, as he put it himself, until \"they had gone through his\njaw.\" He would not allow two complements in the same phrase, and we are\ntold that he was ill after reading in one of his own books the following\nwords: \"Une couronne _de_ fleurs _d_'oranger.\"\n\n\"You do not know what it is,\" he wrote, \"to spend a whole day holding\none's head and squeezing one's brains to find a word. Ideas flow with\nyou freely and continually, like a stream. With me they come like\ntrickling water, and it is only by a huge work of art that I can get\na waterfall. Ah, I have had some experience of the terrible torture of\nstyle!\" No, George Sand certainly had no experience of this kind, and\nshe could not even conceive of such torture. It amazed her to hear of\nsuch painful labour, for, personally, she let the wind play on her \"old\nharp\" just as it listed.\n\nBriefly, she considered that her friend was the victim of a hopeless\nerror. He took literature for the essential thing, but there was\nsomething before all literature, and that something was life. \"The Holy\nof Holies, as you call literature, is only secondary to me in life. I\nhave always loved some one better than it, and my family better than\nthat some one.\"\n\nThis, then, was the keynote of the argument. George Sand considered that\nlife is not only a pretext for literature, but that literature should\nalways refer to life and should be regulated by life, as by a model\nwhich takes the precedence of it and goes far beyond it. This, too, is\nour opinion.\n\nThe state of mind which can be read between the lines in George Sand's\nletters to Flaubert is serenity, and this is also the characteristic of\nher work during the last period of her life. Her \"last style\" is that\nof _Jean de la Rocke_, published in 1860. A young nobleman, Jean de la\nRoche, loses his heart to the exquisite Love Butler. She returns his\naffection, but the jealousy of a young brother obliges them to separate.\nIn order to be near the woman he loves, Jean de la Roche disguises\nhimself as a guide, and accompanies the whole family in an excursion\nthrough the Auvergne mountains. A young nobleman as a guide is by\nno means an ordinary thing, but in love affairs such disguises are\nadmitted. Lovers in the writings of Marivaux took the parts of servants,\nand in former days no one was surprised to meet with princes in disguise\non the high-roads.\n\nGeorge Sand's masterpiece of this kind is undoubtedly _Le Marquis\nde Villemer_, published in 1861. A provincial _chateau_, an old\naristocratic woman, sceptical and indulgent, two brothers capable of\nbeing rivals without ceasing to be friends, a young girl of noble birth,\nbut poor, calumny being spread abroad, but quickly repudiated, some\nwonderful pages of description, and some elegant, sinuous conversations.\nAll this has a certain charm. The poor girl marries the Marquis in\nthe end. This, too, is a return to former days, to the days when kings\nmarried shepherdesses. The pleasure that we have in reading such novels\nis very much like that which we used to feel on hearing fairy-stories.\n\n\"If some one were to tell me the story of _Peau d'Ane_, I should be\ndelighted,\" confessed La Fontaine, and surely it would be bad form to\nbe more difficult and over-nice than he was. Big children as we are,\nwe need stories which give food to our imagination, after being\ndisappointed by the realities of life. This is perhaps the very object\nof the novel. Romance is not necessarily an exaggerated aspiration\ntowards imaginary things. It is something else too. It is the revolt of\nthe soul which is oppressed by the yoke of Nature. It is the expression\nof that tendency within us towards a freedom which is impossible, but\nof which we nevertheless dream. An iron law presides over our destiny.\nAround us and within us, the series of causes and effects continues\nto unwind its hard chain. Every single one of our deeds bears its\nconsequence, and this goes on to eternity. Every fault of ours will\nbring its chastisement. Every weakness will have to be made good. There\nis not a moment of oblivion, not an instant when we may cease to be on\nour guard. Romantic illusion is, then, just an attempt to escape, at\nleast in imagination, from the tyranny of universal order.\n\nIt is impossible, in this volume, to consider all George Sand's works.\nSome of her others are charming, but the whole series would perhaps\nappear somewhat monotonous. There is, however, one novel of this epoch\nto which we must call attention, as it is like a burst of thunder during\ncalm weather. It also reveals an aspect of George Sand's ideas which\nshould not be passed over lightly. This book was perhaps the only\none George Sand wrote under the influence of anger. We refer to\n_Mademoiselle La Quintinie_. Octave Feuillet had just published his\n_Histoire de Sibylle_, and this book made George Sand furiously angry.\nWe are at a loss to comprehend her indignation. Feuillet's novel is very\ngraceful and quite inoffensive. Sibylle is a fanciful young person, who\nfrom her earliest childhood dreams of impossible things. She wants her\ngrandfather to get a star for her, and another time she wants to ride on\nthe swan's back as it swims in the pool. When she is being prepared for\nher first communion, she has doubts about the truth of the Christian\nreligion, but one night, during a storm, the priest of the place springs\ninto a boat and goes to the rescue of some sailors in peril. All the\ndifficulties of theological interpretations are at once dispelled for\nher. A young man falls in love with her, but on discovering that he is\nnot a believer she endeavours to convert him, and goes moonlight walks\nwith him. Moonlight is sometimes dangerous for young girls, and, after\none of these sentimental and theological strolls, she has a mysterious\nailment. . . .\n\nIn order to understand George Sand's anger on reading this novel, which\nwas both religious and social, and at the same time very harmless,\nwe must know what her state of mind was on the essential question of\nreligion.\n\nIn the first place, George Sand was not hostile to religious ideas.\nShe had a religion. There is a George Sand religion. There are not many\ndogmas, and the creed is simple. George Sand believed firmly in the\nexistence of God. Without the notion of God, nothing can be explained\nand no problem solved. This God is not merely the \"first cause.\" It is a\npersonal and conscious God, whose essential, if not sole, function is to\nforgive--every one.\n\n\"The dogma of hell,\" she writes, \"is a monstrosity, an imposture, a\nbarbarism. . . . It is impious to doubt God's infinite pity, and to\nthink that He does not always pardon, even the most guilty of men.\" This\nis certainly the most complete application that has ever been made of\nthe law of pardon. This God is not the God of Jacob, nor of Pascal,\nnor even of Voltaire. He is not an unknown God either. He is the God of\nBeranger and of all good people. George Sand believed also, very\nfirmly, in the immortality of the soul. On losing any of her family, the\ncertainty of going to them some day was her great consolation.\n\n\"I see future and eternal life before me as a certainty,\" she said; \"it\nis like a light, and, thanks to its brilliancy, other things cannot be\nseen; but the light is there, and that is all I need.\" Her belief\nwas, then, in the existence of God, the goodness of Providence and the\nimmortality of the soul. George Sand was an adept in natural religion.\n\nShe did not accept the idea of any revealed religion, and there was one\nof these revealed religions that she execrated. This was the Catholic\nreligion. Her correspondence on this subject during the period of the\nSecond Empire is most significant. She was a personal enemy of the\nChurch, and spoke of the Jesuits as a subscriber to the _Siecle_ might\ndo to-day. She feared the dagger of the Jesuits for Napoleon III, but at\nthe same time she hoped there might be a frustrated attempt at murder,\nso that his eyes might be opened. The great danger of modern times,\naccording to her, was the development of the clerical spirit. She was\nnot an advocate for liberty of education either. \"The priestly spirit\nhas been encouraged,\" she wrote.(53) \"France is overrun with convents,\nand wretched friars have been allowed to take possession of education.\"\nShe considered that wherever the Church was mistress, it left its marks,\nwhich were unmistakable: stupidity and brutishness. She gave Brittany as\nan example.\n\n     (53) _Correspondance:_ To Barbes, May 12, 1867.\n\n\"There is nothing left,\" she writes, \"when the priest and Catholic\nvandalism have passed by, destroying the monuments of the old world and\nleaving their lice for the future.\"(54)\n\n     (54) _Ibid.:_ To Flaubert, September 21, 1860.\n\nIt is no use attempting to ignore the fact. This is anti-clericalism\nin all its violence. Is it not curious that this passion, when once it\ntakes possession of even the most distinguished minds, causes them to\nlose all sentiment of measure, of propriety and of dignity.\n\n_Mademoiselle La Quintinie_ is the result of a fit of anti-clerical\nmania. George Sand gives, in this novel, the counterpart of _Sibylle_.\nEmile Lemontier, a free-thinker, is in love with the daughter of General\nLa Quintinie. Emile is troubled in his mind because, as his _fiancee_\nis a Catholic, he knows she will have to have a confessor. The idea\nis intolerable to him, as, like Monsieur Homais, he considers that\na husband could not endure the idea of his wife having private\nconversations with one of those individuals. Mademoiselle La Quintinie's\nconfessor is a certain Moreali, a near relative of Eugene Sue's Rodin.\nThe whole novel turns on the struggle between Emile and Moreali, which\nends in the final discomfiture of Moreali. Mademoiselle La Quintinie is\nto marry Emile, who will teach her to be a free-thinker. Emile is\nproud of his work of drawing a soul away from Christian communion. He\nconsiders that the light of reason is always sufficient for illuminating\nthe path in a woman's life. He thinks that her natural rectitude will\nprove sufficient for making a good woman of her. I do not wish to call\nthis into question, but even if she should not err, is it not possible\nthat she may suffer? This free-thinker imagines that it is possible to\ntear belief from a heart without rending it and causing an incurable\nwound. Oh, what a poor psychologist! He forgets that beliefs the\nsumming up and the continuation of the belief of a whole series of\ngenerations. He does not hear the distant murmur of the prayers of\nby-gone years. It is in vain to endeavour to stifle those prayers; they\nwill be heard for ever within the crushed and desolate soul.\n\n_Mademoiselle La Quintinie_ is a work of hatred. George Sand was not\nsuccessful with it. She had no vocation for writing such books, and\nshe was not accustomed to writing them. It is a novel full of tiresome\ndissertations, and it is extremely dull.\n\nFrom that date, though, George Sand experienced the joy of a certain\npopularity. At theatrical performances and at funerals the students\nmanifested in her honour. It was the same for Sainte-Beuve, but this\ndoes not seem to have made either of them any greater.\n\nWe will pass over all this, and turn to something that we can admire.\nThe robust and triumphant old age of George Sand was admirable. Nearly\nevery year she went to some fresh place in France to find a setting for\nher stories. She had to earn her living to the very last, and was doomed\nto write novels for ever. \"I shall be turning my wheel when I die,\" she\nused to say, and, after all, this is the proper ending for a literary\nworker.\n\nIn 1870 and 1871, she suffered all the anguish of the \"Terrible Year.\"\nWhen once the nightmare was over, she set to work once more like a true\ndaughter of courageous France, unwilling to give in. She was as hardy\nas iron as she grew old. \"I walk to the river,\" she wrote in 1872, \"and\nbathe in the cold water, warm as I am. . . . I am of the same nature as\nthe grass in the field. Sunshine and water are all I need.\"\n\nFor a woman of sixty-eight to be able to bathe every day in the cold\nwater of the Indre is a great deal. In May, 1876, she was not well, and\nhad to stay in bed. She was ill for ten days, and died without suffering\nmuch. She is buried at Nohant, according to her wishes, so that her last\nsleep is in her beloved Berry.\n\n\nIn conclusion, we would say just a few words about George Sand's genius,\nand the place that she takes in the history of the French novel.\n\nOn comparing George Sand with the novelists of her time, what strikes\nus most is how different she was from them. She is neither like Balzac,\nStendhal, nor Merimee, nor any story-teller of our thoughtful, clever\nand refined epoch. She reminds us more of the \"old novelists,\" of those\nwho told stories of chivalrous deeds and of old legends, or, to go still\nfurther back, she reminds us of the _aedes_ of old Greece. In the early\ndays of a nation there were always men who went to the crowd and charmed\nthem with the stories they told in a wordy way. They scarcely knew\nwhether they invented these stories as they told them, or whether they\nhad heard them somewhere. They could not tell either which was fiction\nand which reality, for all reality seemed wonderful to them. All the\npeople about whom they told were great, all objects were good and\neverything beautiful. They mingled nursery-tales with myths that were\nquite sensible, and the history of nations with children's stories. They\nwere called poets.\n\nGeorge Sand did not employ a versified form for her stories, but she\nbelonged to the family of these poets. She was a poet herself who had\nlost her way and come into our century of prose, and she continued her\nsinging.\n\nLike these early poets, she was primitive. Like them, she obeyed a god\nwithin her. All her talent was instinctive, and she had all the ease\nof instinctive talent. When Flaubert complained to George Sand of the\n\"tortures\" that style cost him, she endeavoured to admire him.\n\n\"When I see the difficulty that my old friend has in writing his novel,\nI am discouraged about my own case, and I say to myself that I am\nwriting poor sort of literature.\"\n\nThis was merely her charity, for she never understood that there could\nbe any effort in writing. Consequently she could not understand that it\nshould cause suffering. For her, writing was a pleasure, as it was the\nsatisfaction of a need. As her works were no effort to her, they left no\ntrace in her memory. She had not intended to write them, and, when once\nwritten, she forgot them.\n\n\"_Consuelo and La Comtesse de Rudolstadt_, what are these books?\" she\nasks. \"Did I write them? I do not remember a single word of them.\"\n\nHer novels were like fruit, which, when ripe, fell away from her. George\nSand always returned to the celebration of certain great themes which\nare the eternal subjects of all poetry, subjects such as love and\nnature, and sentiments like enthusiasm and pity. The very language\ncompletes the illusion. The choice of words was often far from perfect,\nas George Sand's vocabulary was often uncertain, and her expression\nlacked precision and relief. But she had the gift of imagery, and her\nimages were always delightfully fresh. She never lost that rare faculty\nwhich she possessed of being surprised at things, so that she looked at\neverything with youthful eyes. There is a certain movement which carries\nthe reader on, and a rhythm that is soothing. She develops the French\nphrase slowly perhaps, but without any confusion. Her language is like\nthose rivers which flow along full and limpid, between flowery banks\nand oases of verdure, rivers by the side of which the traveller loves to\nlinger and to lose himself in dreams.\n\nThe share which belongs to George Sand in the history of the French\nnovel is that of having impregnated the novel with the poetry in her\nown soul. She gave to the novel a breadth and a range which it had never\nhitherto had. She celebrated the hymn of Nature, of love and of goodness\nin it. She revealed to us the country and the peasants of France. She\ngave satisfaction to the romantic tendency which is in every one of us,\nto a more or less degree.\n\nAll this is more even than is needed to ensure her fame. She denied ever\nhaving written for posterity, and she predicted that in fifty years she\nwould be forgotten. It may be that there has been for her, as there is\nfor every illustrious author who dies, a time of test and a period of\nneglect. The triumph of naturalism, by influencing taste for a time, may\nhave stopped our reading George Sand. At present we are just as tired\nof documentary literature as we are disgusted with brutal literature. We\nare gradually coming back to a better comprehension of what there is of\n\"truth\" in George Sand's conception of the novel. This may be summed up\nin a few words--to charm, to touch and to console. Those of us who know\nsomething of life may perhaps wonder whether to console may not be the\nfinal aim of literature. George Sand's literary ideal may be read in the\nfollowing words, which she wrote to Flaubert:\n\n\"You make the people who read your books still sadder than they were\nbefore. I want to make them less unhappy.\" She tried to do this, and she\noften succeeded in her attempt. What greater praise can we give to her\nthan that? And how can we help adding a little gratitude and affection\nto our admiration for the woman who was the good fairy of the\ncontemporary novel?\n\n\nTHE END"
