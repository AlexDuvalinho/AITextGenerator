 "text": "SUSAN LENOX: HER FALL AND RISE\n\nby\nDavid Graham Phillips\n\nVolume I\n\nWITH A PORTRAIT\nOF THE AUTHOR\n\nD. APPLETON AND COMPANY\nNEW YORK        LONDON\n\n1917\n\n\n\n\n\nDAVID GRAHAM PHILLIPS\n\nA TRIBUTE\n\n\nEven now I cannot realize that he is dead, and often in the city\nstreets--on Fifth Avenue in particular--I find myself glancing\nahead for a glimpse of the tall, boyish, familiar\nfigure--experience once again a flash of the old happy expectancy.\n\nI have lived in many lands, and have known men. I never knew a\nfiner man than Graham Phillips.\n\nHis were the clearest, bluest, most honest eyes I ever saw--eyes\nthat scorned untruth--eyes that penetrated all sham.\n\nIn repose his handsome features were a trifle stern--and the\nmagic of his smile was the more wonderful--such a sunny,\nyouthful, engaging smile.\n\nHis mere presence in a room was exhilarating.  It seemed to\nfreshen the very air with a keen sweetness almost pungent.\n\nHe was tall, spare, leisurely, iron-strong; yet figure, features\nand bearing were delightfully boyish.\n\nMen liked him, women liked him when he liked them.\n\nHe was the most honest man I ever knew, clean in mind, clean-cut\nin body, a little over-serious perhaps, except when among\nintimates; a little prone to hoist the burdens of the world on\nhis young shoulders.\n\nHis was a knightly mind; a paladin character.  But he could\nunbend, and the memory of such hours with him--hours that can\nnever be again--hurts more keenly than the memory of calmer and\nmore sober moments.\n\nWe agreed in many matters, he and I; in many we differed.  To me\nit was a greater honor to differ in opinion with such a man than\nto find an entire synod of my own mind.\n\nBecause--and of course this is the opinion of one man and worth\nno more than that--I have always thought that Graham Phillips\nwas head and shoulders above us all in his profession.\n\nHe was to have been really great.  He is--by his last book,\n\"Susan Lenox.\"\n\nNot that, when he sometimes discussed the writing of it with me,\nI was in sympathy with it.  I was not.  We always were truthful to\neach other.\n\nBut when a giant molds a lump of clay into tremendous masses,\nlesser men become confused by the huge contours, the vast\ndistances, the terrific spaces, the majestic scope of the\nensemble.  So I.  But he went on about his business.\n\nI do not know what the public may think of \"Susan Lenox.\" I\nscarcely know what I think.\n\nIt is a terrible book--terrible and true and beautiful.\n\nUnder the depths there are unspeakable things that writhe.  His\nplumb-line touches them and they squirm.  He bends his head from\nthe clouds to do it.  Is it worth doing?  I don't know.\n\nBut this I do know--that within the range of all fiction of all\nlands and of all times no character has so overwhelmed me as the\ncharacter of Susan Lenox.\n\nShe is as real as life and as unreal.  She is Life.  Hers was the\nconcentrated nobility of Heaven and Hell.  And the divinity of\nthe one and the tragedy of the other.  For she had known\nboth--this girl--the most pathetic, the most human, the most\nhonest character ever drawn by an American writer.\n\nIn the presence of his last work, so overwhelming, so\nstupendous, we lesser men are left at a loss.  Its magnitude\ndemands the perspective that time only can lend it.  Its dignity\nand austerity and its pitiless truth impose upon us that honest\nand intelligent silence which even the quickest minds concede is\nnecessary before an honest verdict.\n\nTruth was his goddess; he wrought honestly and only for her.\n\nHe is dead, but he is to have his day in court.  And whatever the\nverdict, if it be a true one, were he living he would rest content.\n\nROBERT W. CHAMBERS.\n\n\n\n                      BEFORE THE CURTAIN\n\n\nA few years ago, as to the most important and most interesting\nsubject in the world, the relations of the sexes, an author had\nto choose between silence and telling those distorted truths\nbeside which plain lying seems almost white and quite harmless.\nAnd as no author could afford to be silent on the subject that\nunderlies all subjects, our literature, in so far as it\nattempted to deal with the most vital phases of human nature,\nwas beneath contempt.  The authors who knew they were lying sank\nalmost as low as the nasty-nice purveyors of fake idealism and\ncandied pruriency who fancied they were writing the truth.  Now\nit almost seems that the day of lying conscious and unconscious\nis about run.  \"And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall\nmake you free.\"\n\nThere are three ways of dealing with the sex relations of men\nand women--two wrong and one right.\n\nFor lack of more accurate names the two wrong ways may be called\nrespectively the Anglo-Saxon and the Continental.  Both are in\nessence processes of spicing up and coloring up perfectly\ninnocuous facts of nature to make them poisonously attractive to\nperverted palates.  The wishy-washy literature and the\nwishy-washy morality on which it is based are not one stage\nmore--or less--rotten than the libertine literature and the\nlibertine morality on which it is based.  So far as degrading\neffect is concerned, the \"pure, sweet\" story or play, false to\nnature, false to true morality, propagandist of indecent\nemotions disguised as idealism, need yield nothing to the\nso-called \"strong\" story.  Both pander to different forms of the\nsame diseased craving for the unnatural.  Both produce moral\natrophy.  The one tends to encourage the shallow and unthinking\nin ignorance of life and so causes them to suffer the merciless\npenalties of ignorance.  The other tends to miseducate the\nshallow and unthinking, to give them a ruinously false notion of\nthe delights of vice.  The Anglo-Saxon \"morality\" is like a nude\nfigure salaciously draped; the Continental \"strength\" is like a\nnude figure salaciously distorted.  The Anglo-Saxon article reeks\nthe stench of disinfectants; the Continental reeks the stench of\ndegenerate perfume.  The Continental shouts \"Hypocrisy!\" at the\nAnglo-Saxon; the Anglo-Saxon shouts \"Filthiness!\" at the\nContinental.  Both are right; they are twin sisters of the same\nhorrid mother.  And an author of either allegiance has to have\nmany a redeeming grace of style, of character drawing, of\nphilosophy, to gain him tolerance in a clean mind.\n\nThere is the third and right way of dealing with the sex\nrelations of men and women.  That is the way of simple candor and\nnaturalness.  Treat the sex question as you would any other\nquestion.  Don't treat it reverently; don't treat it rakishly.\nTreat it naturally.  Don't insult your intelligence and lower\nyour moral tone by thinking about either the decency or the\nindecency of matters that are familiar, undeniable, and\nunchangeable facts of life.  Don't look on woman as mere female,\nbut as human being.  Remember that she has a mind and a heart as\nwell as a body.  In a sentence, don't join in the prurient clamor\nof \"purity\" hypocrites and \"strong\" libertines that exaggerates\nand distorts the most commonplace, if the most important feature\nof life.  Let us try to be as sensible about sex as we are trying\nto be about all the other phenomena of the universe in this more\nenlightened day.\n\nNothing so sweetens a sin or so delights a sinner as getting\nbig-eyed about it and him.  Those of us who are naughty aren't\nnearly so naughty as we like to think; nor are those of us who\nare nice nearly so nice.  Our virtues and our failings\nare--perhaps to an unsuspected degree--the result of the\ncircumstances in which we are placed.  The way to improve\nindividuals is to improve these circumstances; and the way to\nstart at improving the circumstances is by looking honestly and\nfearlessly at things as they are.  We must know our world and\nourselves before we can know what should be kept and what\nchanged.  And the beginning of this wisdom is in seeing sex\nrelations rationally.  Until that fundamental matter is brought\nunder the sway of good common sense, improvement in other directions\nwill be slow indeed.  Let us stop lying--to others--to ourselves.\n\n                                                D.G.P.\n\nJuly, 1908.\n\n\n\n\nSUSAN LENOX\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\n\"THE child's dead,\" said Nora, the nurse.  It was the upstairs\nsitting-room in one of the pretentious houses of Sutherland,\noldest and most charming of the towns on the Indiana bank of the\nOhio.  The two big windows were open; their limp and listless\ndraperies showed that there was not the least motion in the\nstifling humid air of the July afternoon.  At the center of the\nroom stood an oblong table; over it were neatly spread several\nthicknesses of white cotton cloth; naked upon them lay the body\nof a newborn girl baby.  At one side of the table nearer the\nwindow stood Nora.  Hers were the hard features and corrugated\nskin popularly regarded as the result of a life of toil, but in\nfact the result of a life of defiance to the laws of health.  As\nadditional penalties for that same self-indulgence she had an\nenormous bust and hips, thin face and arms, hollow,\nsinew-striped neck.  The young man, blond and smooth faced, at\nthe other side of the table and facing the light, was Doctor\nStevens, a recently graduated pupil of the famous Schulze of\nSaint Christopher who as much as any other one man is\nresponsible for the rejection of hocus-pocus and the injection\nof common sense into American medicine.  For upwards of an hour\nyoung Stevens, coat off and shirt sleeves rolled to his\nshoulders, had been toiling with the lifeless form on the table.\nHe had tried everything his training, his reading and his\nexperience suggested--all the more or less familiar devices\nsimilar to those indicated for cases of drowning.  Nora had\nwatched him, at first with interest and hope, then with interest\nalone, finally with swiftly deepening disapproval, as her\ncompressed lips and angry eyes plainly revealed.  It seemed to\nher his effort was degenerating into sacrilege, into defiance of\nan obvious decree of the Almighty.  However, she had not ventured\nto speak until the young man, with a muttered ejaculation\nsuspiciously like an imprecation, straightened his stocky figure\nand began to mop the sweat from his face, hands and bared arms.\n\nWhen she saw that her verdict had not been heard, she repeated\nit more emphatically.  \"The child's dead,\" said she, \"as I told\nyou from the set-out.\" She made the sign of the cross on her\nforehead and bosom, while her fat, dry lips moved in a \"Hail, Mary.\"\n\nThe young man did not rouse from his reverie.  He continued to\ngaze with a baffled expression at the tiny form, so like a\nwhimsical caricature of humanity.  He showed that he had heard\nthe woman's remark by saying, to himself rather than to her,\n\"Dead?  What's that?  Merely another name for ignorance.\" But the\ncurrent of his thought did not swerve.  It held to the one\ncourse:  What would his master, the dauntless, the infinitely\nresourceful Schulze, do if he were confronted by this\nintolerable obstacle of a perfect machine refusing to do its\nduty and pump vital force through an eagerly waiting body?\n\"He'd _make_ it go, I'd bet my life,\" the young man muttered.\n\"I'm ashamed of myself.\"\n\nAs if the reproach were just the spur his courage and his\nintelligence had needed, his face suddenly glowed with the\nupshooting fire of an inspiration.  He thrust the big white\nhandkerchief into his hip pocket, laid one large strong hand\nupon the small, beautifully arched chest of the baby.  Nora,\nroused by his expression even more than by his gesture, gave an\nexclamation of horror.  \"Don't touch it again,\" she cried,\nbetween entreaty and command.  \"You've done all you can--and more.\"\n\nStevens was not listening.  \"Such a fine baby, too,\" he said,\nhesitating--the old woman mistakenly fancied it was her words\nthat made him pause.  \"I feel no good at all,\" he went on, as if\nreasoning with himself, \"no good at all, losing both the mother\nand the child.\"\n\n\"_She_ didn't want to live,\" replied Nora.  Her glances stole\nsomewhat fearfully toward the door of the adjoining room--the\nbedroom where the mother lay dead.\n\n\"There wasn't nothing but disgrace ahead for both of them.\nEverybody'll be glad.\"\n\n\"Such a fine baby,\" muttered the abstracted young doctor.\n\n\"Love-children always is,\" said Nora.  She was looking sadly and\ntenderly down at the tiny, symmetrical form--symmetrical to her\nand the doctor's expert eyes.  \"Such a deep chest,\" she sighed.\n\"Such pretty hands and feet.  A real love-child.\" There she\nglanced nervously at the doctor; it was meet and proper and\npious to speak well of the dead, but she felt she might be going\nrather far for a \"good woman.\"\n\n\"I'll try it,\" cried the young man in a resolute tone.  \"It can't\ndo any harm, and----\"\n\nWithout finishing his sentence he laid hold of the body by the\nankles, swung it clear of the table.  As Nora saw it dangling\nhead downwards like a dressed suckling pig on a butcher's hook\nshe vented a scream and darted round the table to stop by main\nforce this revolting desecration of the dead.  Stevens called out\nsternly:  \"Mind your business, Nora!  Push the table against the\nwall and get out of the way.  I want all the room there is.\"\n\n\"Oh, Doctor--for the blessed Jesus' sake----\"\n\n\"Push back that table!\"\n\nNora shrank before his fierce eyes.  She thought his exertions,\nhis disappointment and the heat had combined to topple him over\ninto insanity.  She retreated toward the farther of the open\nwindows.  With a curse at her stupidity Stevens kicked over the\ntable, used his foot vigorously in thrusting it to the wall.\n\"Now!\" exclaimed he, taking his stand in the center of the room\nand gauging the distance of ceiling, floor and walls.\n\nNora, her back against the window frame, her fingers sunk in her\nbig loose bosom, stared petrified.  Stevens, like an athlete\nswinging an indian club, whirled the body round and round his\nhead, at the full length of his powerful arms.  More and more\nrapidly he swung it, until his breath came and went in gasps and\nthe sweat was trickling in streams down his face and neck.  Round\nand round between ceiling and floor whirled the naked body of\nthe baby--round and round for minutes that seemed hours to the\nhorrified nurse--round and round with all the strength and speed\nthe young man could put forth--round and round until the room\nwas a blur before his throbbing eyes, until his expression\nbecame fully as demoniac as Nora had been fancying it.  Just as\nshe was recovering from her paralysis of horror and was about to\nfly shrieking from the room she was halted by a sound that made\nher draw in air until her bosom swelled as if it would burst its\ngingham prison.  She craned eagerly toward Stevens.  He was\nwhirling the body more furiously than ever.\n\n\"Was that you?\" asked Nora hoarsely.  \"Or was it----\"  She paused,\nlistened.\n\nThe sound came again--the sound of a drowning person fighting for\nbreath.\n\n\"It's--it's----\" muttered Nora.  \"What is it, Doctor?\"\n\n\"Life!\" panted Stevens, triumph in his glistening, streaming face.\n\"Life!\"\n\nHe continued to whirl the little form, but not so rapidly or so\nvigorously.  And now the sound was louder, or, rather, less\nfaint, less uncertain--was a cry--was the cry of a living thing.\n\"She's alive--alive!\" shrieked the woman, and in time with his\nmovements she swayed to and fro from side to side, laughing,\nweeping, wringing her hands, patting her bosom, her cheeks.  She\nstretched out her arms.  \"My prayers are answered!\" she cried.\n\"Don't kill her, you brute!  Give her to me.  You shan't treat a\nbaby that way.\"\n\nThe unheeding doctor kept on whirling until the cry was\ncontinuous, a low but lusty wail of angry protest.  Then he\nstopped, caught the baby up in both arms, burst out laughing.\n\"You little minx!\" he said--or, rather, gasped--a tenderness\nquite maternal in his eyes.  \"But I got you!  Nora, the table.\"\n\nNora righted the table, spread and smoothed the cloths, extended\nher scrawny eager arms for the baby.  Stevens with a jerk of the\nhead motioned her aside, laid the baby on the table.  He felt for\nthe pulse at its wrist, bent to listen at the heart.  Quite\nuseless.  That strong, rising howl of helpless fury was proof\nenough.  Her majesty the baby was mad through and\nthrough--therefore alive through and through.\n\n\"Grand heart action!\" said the young man.  He stood aloof, hands\non his hips, head at a proud angle.  \"You never saw a healthier\nspecimen.  It'll be many a year, bar accidents, before she's that\nnear death again.\"\n\nBut it was Nora's turn not to hear.  She was soothing and\nswaddling the outraged baby.  \"There--there!\" she crooned.\n\"Nora'll take care of you.  The bad man shan't come near my\nlittle precious--no, the wicked man shan't touch her again.\"\n\nThe bedroom door opened.  At the slight noise superstitious Nora\npaled, shriveled within her green and white checked gingham.  She\nslowly turned her head as if on this day of miracles she\nexpected yet another--the resurrection of the resurrected\nbaby's mother, \"poor Miss Lorella.\" But Lorella Lenox was\nforever tranquil in the sleep that engulfed her and the sorrows\nin which she had been entangled by an impetuous, trusting heart.\nThe apparition in the doorway was commonplace--the mistress of\nthe house, Lorella's elder and married sister Fanny--neither\nfair nor dark, neither tall nor short, neither thin nor fat,\nneither pretty nor homely, neither stupid nor bright, neither\nneat nor dowdy--one of that multitude of excellent, unobtrusive\nhuman beings who make the restful stretches in a world of\nagitations--and who respond to the impetus of circumstance as\nunresistingly as cloud to wind.\n\nAs the wail of the child smote upon Fanny's ears she lifted her\nhead, startled, and cried out sharply, \"What's that?\"\n\n\"We've saved the baby, Mrs. Warham,\" replied the young doctor,\nbeaming on her through his glasses.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Mrs. Warham.  And she abruptly seated herself on the\nbig chintz-covered sofa beside the door.\n\n\"And it's a lovely child,\" pleaded Nora.  Her woman's instinct\nguided her straight to the secret of the conflict raging behind\nMrs. Warham's unhappy face.\n\n\"The finest girl in the world,\" cried Stevens, well-meaning but tactless.\n\n\"Girl!\" exclaimed Fanny, starting up from the sofa.  \"Is it a _girl_?\"\n\nNora nodded.  The young man looked downcast; he was realizing the\npractical side of his victory for science--the consequences to\nthe girl child, to all the relatives.\n\n\"A girl!\" moaned Fanny, sinking to the sofa again.  \"God have mercy on us!\"\n\nLouder and angrier rose the wail.  Fanny, after a brief struggle\nwith herself, hurried to the table, looked down at the tiny\nhelplessness.  Her face softened.  She had been a mother four\ntimes.  Only one had lived--her fair little two-year-old Ruth--and\nshe would never have any more children.  The tears glistened in\nher eyes.  \"What ails you, Nora Mulvey?\" she demanded.  \"Why\naren't you 'tending to this poor little creature?\"\n\nNora sprang into action, but she wrapped the baby herself.  The\ndoctor in deep embarrassment withdrew to the farther window.  She\nfussed over the baby lingeringly, but finally resigned it to the\nnurse.  \"Take it into the bathroom,\" she said, \"where everything's\nready to feed it--though I never dreamed----\"  As Nora was about\nto depart, she detained her.  \"Let me look at it again.\"\n\nThe nurse understood that Fanny Warham was searching for\nevidence of the mysterious but suspected paternity whose secret\nLorella, with true Lenox obstinacy, had guarded to the end.  The\ntwo women scanned the features.  A man would at a glance have\nabandoned hope of discovering anything from a chart so vague and\nconfused as that wrinkled, twisted, swollen face of the newborn.\nNot so a woman.  Said Nora:  \"She seems to me to favor the\nLenoxes.  But I think--I _kind_ o' think--I see a _trace_\nof--of----\"  There she halted, waiting for encouragement.\n\n\"Of Galt?\" suggested Fanny, in an undertone.\n\n\"Of Galt,\" assented Nora, her tone equally discreet.  \"That nose\nis Galt-like and the set of the ears--and a kind of something to\nthe neck and shoulders.\"\n\n\"Maybe so,\" said Fanny doubtfully.  She shook her head drearily,\nsighed.  \"What's the use?  Lorella's gone.  And this morning\nGeneral Galt came down to see my husband with a letter he'd got\nfrom Jimmie.  Jimmie denies it.  Perhaps so.  Again, perhaps the\nGeneral wrote him to write that, and threatened him if he\ndidn't.  But what's the use?  We'll never know.\"\n\nAnd they never did.\n\nWhen young Stevens was leaving, George Warham waylaid him at the\nfront gate, separated from the spacious old creeper-clad house\nby long lawns and an avenue of elms.  \"I hear the child's going\nto live,\" said he anxiously.\n\n\"I've never seen anything more alive,\" replied Stevens.\n\nWarham stared gloomily at the ground.  He was evidently ashamed\nof his feelings, yet convinced that they were human and natural.\nA moment's silence between the men, then Stevens put his hand on\nthe gate latch.  \"Did--did--my wife----\" began Warham.  \"Did she\nsay what she calculated to do?\"\n\n\"Not a word, George.\" After a silence.  \"You know how fond she\nis of babies.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" replied Warham.  \"Fanny is a true woman if ever\nthere was one.\" With a certain defiance, \"And Lorella--she was\na sweet, womanly girl!\"\n\n\"As sweet and good as she was pretty,\" replied Stevens heartily.\n\n\"The way she kept her mouth shut about that hound, whoever he\nis!\" Warham's Roman face grew savage, revealed in startling\napparition a stubborn cruelty of which there was not a trace\nupon the surface.  \"If I ever catch the ---- ---- I'll fill him\nfull of holes.\"\n\n\"He'd be lynched--_whoever_ he is,\" said Stevens.\n\n\"That's right!\" cried Warham.  \"This is the North, but it's near\nenough to Kentucky to know what to do with a wretch of that\nsort.\" His face became calmer.  \"That poor little baby!  He'll\nhave a hard row to hoe.\"\n\nStevens flushed a guilty red.  \"It's--it's--a girl,\" he stammered.\n\nWarham stared.  \"A _girl_!\" he cried.  Then his face reddened and\nin a furious tone he burst out:  \"Now don't that beat the devil\nfor luck!. . .  A girl!  Good Lord--a girl!\"\n\n\"Nobody in this town'll blame her,\" consoled Stevens.\n\n\"You know better than that, Bob!  A girl!  Why, it's downright\nwicked. . .  I wonder what Fanny allows to do?\" He showed what\nfear was in his mind by wheeling savagely on Stevens with a\nstormy, \"We can't keep her--we simply can't!\"\n\n\"What's to become of her?\" protested Stevens gently.\n\nWarham made a wild vague gesture with both arms.  \"Damn if I\nknow!  I've got to look out for my own daughter.  I won't have it.\nDamn it, I won't have it!\" Stevens lifted the gate latch.  \"Well----\n\n\"Good-by, George.  I'll look in again this evening.\" And knowing\nthe moral ideas of the town, all he could muster by way of\nencouragement was a half-hearted \"Don't borrow trouble.\"\n\nBut Warham did not hear.  He was moving up the tanbark walk\ntoward the house, muttering to himself.  When Fanny, unable\nlonger to conceal Lorella's plight, had told him, pity and\naffection for his sweet sister-in-law who had made her home with\nthem for five years had triumphed over his principles.  He had\nhimself arranged for Fanny to hide Lorella in New York until she\ncould safely return.  But just as the sisters were about to set\nout, Lorella, low in body and in mind, fell ill.  Then\nGeorge--and Fanny, too--had striven with her to give them the\nname of her betrayer, that he might be compelled to do her\njustice.  Lorella refused.  \"I told him,\" she said, \"and he--I\nnever want to see him again.\" They pleaded the disgrace to them,\nbut she replied that he would not marry her even if she would\nmarry him; and she held to her refusal with the firmness for\nwhich the Lenoxes were famous.  They suspected Jimmie Galt,\nbecause he had been about the most attentive of the young men\nuntil two or three months before, and because he had abruptly\ndeparted for Europe to study architecture.  Lorella denied that\nit was he.  \"If you kill him,\" she said to Warham, \"you kill an\ninnocent man.\" Warham was so exasperated by her obstinacy that\nhe was at first for taking her at her offer and letting her go\naway.  But Fanny would not hear of it, and he acquiesced.\nNow--\"This child must be sent away off somewhere, and never be\nheard of again,\" he said to himself.  \"If it'd been a boy,\nperhaps it might have got along.  But a girl----\n\n\"There's nothing can be done to make things right for a girl\nthat's got no father and no name.\"\n\nThe subject did not come up between him and his wife until about\na week after Lorella's funeral.  But he was thinking of nothing\nelse.  At his big grocery store--wholesale and retail--he sat\nmorosely in his office, brooding over the disgrace and the\ndanger of deeper disgrace--for he saw what a hold the baby\nalready had upon his wife.  He was ashamed to appear in the\nstreets; he knew what was going on behind the sympathetic faces,\nheard the whisperings as if they had been trumpetings.  And he\nwas as much afraid of his own soft heart as of his wife's.  But\nfor the sake of his daughter he must be firm and just.\n\nOne morning, as he was leaving the house after breakfast, he\nturned back and said abruptly:  \"Fan, don't you think you'd\nbetter send the baby away and get it over with?\"\n\n\"No,\" said his wife unhesitatingly--and he knew his worst\nsuspicion was correct.  \"I've made up my mind to keep her.\"\n\n\"It isn't fair to Ruth.\"\n\n\"Send it away--where?\"\n\n\"Anywhere.  Get it adopted in Chicago--Cincinnati--Louisville.\"\n\n\"Lorella's baby?\"\n\n\"When she and Ruth grow up--what then?\"\n\n\"People ain't so low as some think.\"\n\n\"'The sins of the parents are visited on the children unto----'\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" interrupted Fanny.  \"I love her.  I'm going to\nkeep her.  Wait here a minute.\"\n\nWhen she came back she had the baby in her arms.  \"Just look,\"\nshe said softly.\n\nGeorge frowned, tried not to look, but was soon drawn and held by\nthe sweet, fresh, blooming face, so smooth, so winning, so innocent.\n\n\"And think how she was sent back to life--from beyond the grave.\nIt must have been for some purpose.\"\n\nWarham groaned, \"Oh, Lord, I don't know _what_ to do!  But--it\nain't fair to our Ruth.\"\n\n\"I don't see it that way. . . .  Kiss her, George.\"\n\nWarham kissed one of the soft cheeks, swelling like a ripening\napple.  The baby opened wide a pair of wonderful dark eyes, threw\nup its chubby arms and laughed--such a laugh!. . .  There was no\nmore talk of sending her away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nNOT quite seventeen years later, on a fine June morning, Ruth\nWarham issued hastily from the house and started down the long\ntanbark walk from the front veranda to the street gate.  She was\nnow nineteen--nearer twenty--and a very pretty young woman,\nindeed.  She had grown up one of those small slender blondes,\nexquisite and doll-like, who cannot help seeming fresh and\nsweet, whatever the truth about them, without or within.  This\nmorning she had on a new summer dress of a blue that matched her\neyes and harmonized with her coloring.  She was looking her best,\nand she had the satisfying, confidence-giving sense that it was\nso.  Like most of the unattached girls of small towns, she was\nalways dreaming of the handsome stranger who would fall in\nlove--the thrilling, love-story kind of love at first sight.  The\nweather plays a conspicuous part in the romancings of youth; she\nfelt that this was precisely the kind of day fate would be most\nlikely to select for the meeting.  Just before dressing she had\nbeen reading about the wonderful _him_--in Robert Chambers'\nlatest story--and she had spent full fifteen minutes of blissful\nreverie over the accompanying Fisher illustration.  Now she was\nissuing hopefully forth, as hopefully as if adventure were the\nrule and order of life in Sutherland, instead of a desperate\nmonotony made the harder to bear by the glory of its scenery.\n\nShe had got only far enough from the house to be visible to the\nsecond-story windows when a young voice called:\n\n\"Ruthie!  Aren't you going to wait for me?\"\n\nRuth halted; an expression anything but harmonious with the\npretty blue costume stormed across her face.  \"I won't have her\nalong!\" she muttered.  \"I simply won't!\" She turned slowly and,\nas she turned, effaced every trace of temper with a dexterity\nwhich might have given an onlooker a poorer opinion of her\ncharacter than perhaps the facts as to human nature justify.  The\ncountenance she presently revealed to those upper windows was\nsunny and sweet.  No one was visible; but the horizontal slats in\none of the only closed pair of shutters and a vague suggestion\nof movement rather than form behind them gave the impression\nthat a woman, not far enough dressed to risk being seen from the\nstreet, was hidden there.  Evidently Ruth knew, for it was toward\nthis window that she directed her gaze and the remark:  \"Can't\nwait, dear.  I'm in a great hurry.  Mamma wants the silk right\naway and I've got to match it.\"\n\n\"But I'll be only a minute,\" pleaded the voice--a much more\ninteresting, more musical voice than Ruth's rather shrill and\nthin high soprano.\n\n\"No--I'll meet you up at papa's store.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nRuth resumed her journey.  She smiled to herself.  \"That means,\"\nsaid she, half aloud, \"I'll steer clear of the store this morning.\"\n\nBut as she was leaving the gate into the wide, shady, sleepy\nstreet, who should come driving past in a village cart but\nLottie Wright!  And Lottie reined her pony in to the sidewalk and\nin the shade of a symmetrical walnut tree proceeded to invite\nRuth to a dance--a long story, as Lottie had to tell all about\nit, the decorations, the favors, the food, who would be there,\nwhat she was going to wear, and so on and on.  Ruth was intensely\ninterested but kept remembering something that caused her to\nglance uneasily from time to time up the tanbark walk under the\narching boughs toward the house.  Even if she had not been\ninterested, she would hardly have ventured to break off; Lottie\nWright was the only daughter of the richest man in Sutherland\nand, therefore, social arbiter to the younger set.\n\nLottie stopped abruptly, said:  \"Well, I really must get on.  And\nthere's your cousin coming down the walk.  I know you've been\nwaiting for her.\"\n\nRuth tried to keep in countenance, but a blush of shame and a\nfrown of irritation came in spite of her.\n\n\"I'm sorry I can't ask Susie, too,\" pursued Lottie, in a voice\nof hypocritical regret.  \"But there are to be exactly eighteen\ncouples--and I couldn't.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Ruth heartily.  \"Susan'll understand.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't for the world do anything to hurt her feelings,\"\ncontinued Lottie with the self-complacent righteousness of a\ndeacon telling the congregation how good \"grace\" has made him.\nHer prominent commonplace brown eyes were gazing up the walk, an\nexpression distressingly like envious anger in them.  She had a\nthick, pudgy face, an oily skin, an outcropping of dull red\npimples on the chin.  Many women can indulge their passion for\nsweets at meals and sweets between meals without serious\ninjury--to complexion; Lottie Wright, unluckily, couldn't.\n\n\"I feel sorry for Susie,\" she went on, in the ludicrous\npatronizing tone that needs no describing to anyone acquainted\nwith any fashionable set anywhere from China to Peru.  \"And I\nthink the way you all treat her is simply beautiful.  But, then,\neverybody feels sorry for her and tries to be kind.  She\nknows--about herself, I mean--doesn't she, Ruthie?\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" replied Ruth, almost hanging her head in her\nmortification.  \"She's very good and sweet.\"\n\n\"Indeed, she is,\" said Lottie.  \"And father says she's far and\naway the prettiest girl in town.\"\n\nWith this parting shot, which struck precisely where she had\naimed, Lottie gathered up the reins and drove on, calling out a\nfriendly \"Hello, Susie dearie,\" to Susan Lenox, who, on her\npurposely lagging way from the house, had nearly reached the gate.\n\n\"What a nasty thing Lottie Wright is!\" exclaimed Ruth to her cousin.\n\n\"She has a mean tongue,\" admitted Susan, tall and slim and\nstraight, with glorious dark hair and a skin healthily pallid\nand as smooth as clear.  \"But she's got a good heart.  She gives\na lot away to poor people.\"\n\n\"Because she likes to patronize and be kowtowed to,\" retorted\nRuth.  \"She's mean, I tell you.\" Then, with a vicious gleam in\nthe blue eyes that hinted a deeper and less presentable motive\nfor the telling, she added:  \"Why, she's not going to ask you\nto her party.\"\n\nSusan was obviously unmoved.  \"She has the right to ask whom she\npleases.  And\"--she laughed--\"if I were giving a party I'd not\nwant to ask her--though I might do it for fear she'd feel left out.\"\n\n\"Don't you feel--left out?\"\n\nSusan shook her head.  \"I seem not to care much about going to\nparties lately.  The boys don't like to dance with me, and I get\ntired of sitting the dances out.\"\n\nThis touched Ruth's impulsively generous heart and woman's easy\ntears filled her eyes; her cousin's remark was so pathetic, the\nmore pathetic because its pathos was absolutely unconscious.\nRuth shot a pitying glance at Susan, but the instant she saw the\nloveliness of the features upon which that expression of\nunconsciousness lay like innocence upon a bed of roses, the pity\nvanished from her eyes to be replaced by a disfiguring envy as\nhateful as an evil emotion can be at nineteen.  Susan still\nlacked nearly a month of seventeen, but she seemed older than\nRuth because her mind and her body had developed beyond her\nyears--or, perhaps it would be more accurate to say beyond the\naverage of growth at seventeen.  Also, her personality was\nstronger, far more definite.  Ruth tried to believe herself the\ncleverer and the more beautiful, at times with a certain\nsuccess.  But as she happened to be a shrewd young person--an\ninheritance from the Warhams--she was haunted by misgivings--and\nworse.  Those whose vanity never suffers from these torments\nwill, of course, condemn her; but whoever has known the pain of\nhaving to concede superiority to someone with whom she or he--is\nconstantly contrasted will not be altogether without sympathy\nfor Ruth in her struggles, often vain struggles, against the\nmortal sin of jealousy.\n\nThe truth is, Susan was beyond question the beauty of\nSutherland.  Her eyes, very dark at birth, had changed to a soft,\ndreamy violet-gray.  Hair and coloring, lashes and eyebrows\nremained dark; thus her eyes and the intense red of her lips had\nthat vicinage of contrast which is necessary to distinction.  To\nlook at her was to be at once fascinated by those violet-gray\neyes--by their color, by their clearness, by their regard of\ncalm, grave inquiry, by their mystery not untouched by a certain\nsadness.  She had a thick abundance of wavy hair, not so long as\nRuth's golden braids, but growing beautifully instead of thinly\nabout her low brow, about her delicately modeled ears, and at\nthe back of her exquisite neck.  Her slim nose departed enough\nfrom the classic line to prevent the suggestion of monotony that\nis in all purely classic faces.  Her nostrils had the\nsensitiveness that more than any other outward sign indicates\nthe imaginative temperament.  Her chin and throat--to look at\nthem was to know where her lover would choose to kiss her first.\nWhen she smiled her large even teeth were dazzling.  And the\nsmile itself was exceedingly sweet and winning, with the\nviolet-gray eyes casting over it that seriousness verging on\nsadness which is the natural outlook of a highly intelligent\nnature.  For while stupid vain people are suspicious and easily\noffended, only the intelligent are truly sensitive--keenly\nsusceptible to all sensations.  The dull ear is suspicious; the\nacute ear is sensitive.\n\nThe intense red of her lips, at times so vivid that it seemed\nartificial, and their sinuous, sensitive curve indicated a\ntemperament that was frankly proclaimed in her figure--sensuous,\ngraceful, slender--the figure of girlhood in its perfection and\nof perfect womanhood, too--like those tropical flowers that look\ninnocent and young and fresh, yet stir in the beholder\npassionate longings and visions.  Her walk was worthy of face and\nfigure--free and firm and graceful, the small head carried\nproudly without haughtiness.\n\nThis physical beauty had as an aureole to illuminate it and to\nset it off a manner that was wholly devoid of mannerisms--of\nthose that men and women think out and exhibit to give added\ncharm to themselves--tricks of cuteness, as lisp and baby stare;\ntricks of dignity, as grave brow and body always carried rigidly\nerect; tricks of sweetness and kindliness, as the ever ready\nsmile and the warm handclasp.  Susan, the interested in the\nworld about her, Susan, the self-unconscious, had none of these\ntricks.  She was at all times her own self.  Beauty is anything\nbut rare, likewise intelligence.  But this quality of naturalness\nis the greatest of all qualities.  It made Susan Lenox unique.\n\nIt was not strange--nor inexcusable that the girls and their\nparents had begun to pity Susan as soon as this beauty developed\nand this personality had begun to exhale its delicious perfume.\nIt was but natural that they should start the whole town to\n\"being kind to the poor thing.\" And it was equally the matter of\ncourse that they should have achieved their object--should have\nimpressed the conventional masculine mind of the town with such\na sense of the \"poor thing's\" social isolation and\n\"impossibility\" that the boys ceased to be her eagerly admiring\nfriends, were afraid to be alone with her, to ask her to dance.\nWomen are conventional as a business; but with men\nconventionality is a groveling superstition.  The youths of\nSutherland longed for, sighed for the alluring, sweet, bright\nSusan; but they dared not, with all the women saying \"Poor\nthing! What a pity a nice man can't afford to have anything to\ndo with her!\" It was an interesting typical example of the\nprofound snobbishness of the male character.  Rarely, after Susan\nwas sixteen, did any of the boys venture to ask her to dance and\nso give himself the joy of encircling that lovely form of hers;\nyet from babyhood her fascination for the male sex, regardless\nof age or temperament, had been uncanny--\"naturally, she being\na love-child,\" said the old women.  And from fourteen on, it grew\nsteadily.\n\nIt would be difficult for one who has not lived in a small town\nto understand exactly the kind of isolation to which Sutherland\nconsigned the girl without her realizing it, without their fully\nrealizing it themselves.  Everyone was friendly with her.  A\nstranger would not have noticed any difference in the treatment\nof her and of her cousin Ruth.  Yet not one of the young men\nwould have thought of marrying her, would have regarded her as\nhis equal or the equal of his sisters.  She went to all the\ngeneral entertainments.  She was invited to all the houses when\nfailure to invite her would have seemed pointed--but only then.\nShe did not think much about herself; she was fond of\nstudy--fonder of reading--fondest, perhaps, of making dresses\nand hats, especially for Ruth, whom she thought much prettier\nthan herself.  Thus, she was only vaguely, subconsciously\nconscious of there being something peculiar and mysterious in\nher lot.\n\nThis isolation, rather than her dominant quality of\nself-effacing consideration for others, was the chief cause of\nthe extraordinary innocence of her mind.  No servant, no girl, no\naudacious boy ever ventured to raise with her any question\nremotely touching on sex.  All those questions seemed to Puritan\nSutherland in any circumstances highly indelicate; in relation\nto Susan they seemed worse than indelicate, dreadful though the\nthought was that there could be anything worse than indelicacy.\nAt fifteen she remained as unaware of even the existence of the\nmysteries of sex as she had been at birth.  Nothing definite\nenough to arouse her curiosity had ever been said in her\nhearing; and such references to those matters as she found in\nher reading passed her by, as any matter of which he has not the\nbeginnings of knowledge will fail to arrest the attention of any\nreader.  It was generally assumed that she knew all about her\norigin, that someone had, some time or other, told her.  Even her\nAunt Fanny thought so, thought she was hiding the knowledge deep\nin her heart, explained in that way her content with the\nsolitude of books and sewing.\n\nSusan was the worst possible influence in Ruth's life.  Our\ncharacter is ourself, is born with us, clings to us as the flesh\nto our bones, persists unchanged until we die.  But upon the\ncircumstances that surround us depends what part of our\ncharacter shall show itself.  Ruth was born with perhaps\nsomething more than the normal tendency to be envious and petty.\nBut these qualities might never have shown themselves\nconspicuously had there been no Susan for her to envy.  The very\nqualities that made Susan lovable reacted upon the pretty, pert\nblond cousin to make her the more unlovable.  Again and again,\nwhen she and Susan were about to start out together, and Susan\nwould appear in beauty and grace of person and dress, Ruth would\nexcuse herself, would fly to her room to lock herself in and\nweep and rage and hate.  And at the high school, when Susan\nscored in a recitation or in some dramatic entertainment, Ruth\nwould sit with bitten lip and surging bosom, pale with jealousy.\nSusan's isolation, the way the boys avoided having with her the\nfriendly relations that spring up naturally among young people\nthese gave Ruth a partial revenge.  But Susan, seemingly\nunconscious, rising sweetly and serenely above all pettiness--\n\nRuth's hatred deepened, though she hid it from everyone, almost\nfrom herself.  And she depended more and more utterly upon Susan\nto select her clothes for her, to dress her, to make her look\nwell; for Susan had taste and Ruth had not.\n\nOn that bright June morning as the cousins went up Main Street\ntogether, Susan gave herself over to the delight of sun and air\nand of the flowering gardens before the attractive houses they\nwere passing; Ruth, with the day quite dark for her, all its\njoys gone, was fighting against a hatred of her cousin so\nvicious that it made her afraid.  \"I'll have no chance at all,\"\nher angry heart was saying, \"so long as Susie's around, keeping\neverybody reminded of the family shame.\" And that was a truth\nshe could not downface, mean and ungenerous though thinking it\nmight be.  The worst of all was that Susan, in a simple white\ndress and an almost untrimmed white straw hat with a graceful\ncurve to its brim and set at the right angle upon that wavy dark\nhair, was making the beauty of her short blond cousin dim and\nsomehow common.\n\nAt the corner of Maple Street Ruth's self-control reached its\nlimit.  She halted, took the sample of silk from her glove.  There\nwas not a hint of her feelings in her countenance, for shame and\nthe desire to seem to be better than she was were fast making\nher an adept in hypocrisy.  \"You go ahead and match it for\nmamma,\" said she.  \"I've got to run in and see Bessie Andrews.\"\n\n\"But I promised Uncle George I'd come and help him with the\nmonthly bills,\" objected Susan.\n\n\"You can do both.  It'll take you only a minute.  If mother had\nknown you were going uptown, she'd never have trusted _me_.\" And\nRuth had tucked the sample in Susan's belt and was hurrying out\nMaple Street.  There was nothing for Susan to do but go on alone.\n\nTwo squares, and she was passing the show place of Sutherland,\nthe home of the Wrights.  She paused to regale herself with a\nglance into the grove of magnificent elms with lawns and bright\ngardens beyond--for the Wright place filled the entire square\nbetween Broad and Myrtle Streets and from Main to Monroe.  She\nwas starting on when she saw among the trees a young man in\nstriped flannels.  At the same instant he saw her.\n\n\"Hel-_lo_, Susie!\" he cried.  \"I was thinking about you.\"\n\nSusan halted.  \"When did you get back, Sam?\" she asked.  \"I heard\nyou were going to stay on in the East all summer.\"\n\nAfter they had shaken hands across the hedge that came almost to\ntheir shoulders, Susan began to move on.  Sam kept pace with her\non his side of the carefully trimmed boxwood barrier.  \"I'm going\nback East in about two weeks,\" said he.  \"It's awfully dull here\nafter Yale.  I just blew in--haven't seen Lottie or father yet.\nComing to Lottie's party?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nSusan laughed merrily.  \"The best reason in the world.  Lottie has\nonly invited just so many couples.\"\n\n\"I'll see about that,\" cried Sam.  \"You'll be asked all right, all right.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan.  She was one of those whose way of saying no\ngives its full meaning and intent.  \"I'll not be asked, thank\nyou--and I'll not go if I am.\"\n\nBy this time they were at the gate.  He opened it, came out into\nthe street.  He was a tallish, athletic youth, dark, and pleasing\nenough of feature to be called handsome.  He was dressed with a\ngreat deal of style of the efflorescent kind called sophomoric.\nHe was a Sophomore at Yale.  But that was not so largely\nresponsible for his self-complacent expression as the deference\nhe had got from babyhood through being heir apparent to the\nWright fortune.  He had a sophisticated way of inspecting Susan's\ncharms of figure no less than charms of face that might have made\na disagreeable impression upon an experienced onlooker.  There is\na time for feeling without knowing why one feels; and that period\nought not to have been passed for young Wright for many a year.\n\n\"My, but you're looking fine, Susie!\" exclaimed he.  \"I haven't\nseen anyone that could hold a candle to you even in the East.\"\n\nSusan laughed and blushed with pleasure.  \"Go on,\" said she with\nraillery.  \"I love it.\"\n\n\"Come in and sit under the trees and I'll fill all the time\nyou'll give me.\"\n\nThis reminded her.  \"I must hurry uptown,\" she said.  \"Good-by.\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" cried he.  \"What have you got to do?\" He happened to\nglance down the street.  \"Isn't that Ruth coming?\"\n\n\"So it is,\" said Susan.  \"I guess Bessie Andrews wasn't at home.\"\n\nSam waved at Ruth and called, \"Hello!  Glad to see you.\"\n\nRuth was all sweetness and smiles.  She and her mother--quite\nprivately and with nothing openly said on either side--had\ncanvassed Sam as a \"possibility.\" There had been keen\ndisappointment at the news that he was not coming home for the\nlong vacation.  \"How are you, Sam?\" said she, as they shook\nhands.  \"My, Susie, _doesn't_ he look New York?\"\n\nSam tried to conceal that he was swelling with pride.  \"Oh, this\nis nothing,\" said he deprecatingly.\n\nRuth's heart was a-flutter.  The Fisher picture of the Chambers\nlove-maker, thought she, might almost be a photograph of Sam.\nShe was glad she had obeyed the mysterious impulse to make a\ntoilette of unusual elegance that morning.  How get rid of Susan?\n\"_I_'ll take the sample, Susie,\" said she.  \"Then you won't have to\nkeep father waiting.\"\n\nSusie gave up the sample.  Her face was no longer so bright and interested.\n\n\"Oh, drop it,\" cried Sam.  \"Come in--both of you.  I'll telephone\nfor Joe Andrews and we'll take a drive--or anything you like.\"\nHe was looking at Susan.\n\n\"Can't do it,\" replied Susan.  \"I promised Uncle George.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother!\" urged Sam.  \"Telephone him.  It'll be all\nright--won't it, Ruth?\"\n\n\"You don't know Susie,\" said Ruth, with a queer, strained laugh.\n\"She'd rather die than break a promise.\"\n\n\"I must go,\" Susan now said.  \"Good-by.\"\n\n\"Come on, Ruth,\" cried Sam.  \"Let's walk uptown with her.\"\n\n\"And you can help match the silk,\" said Ruth.\n\n\"Not for me,\" replied young Wright.  Then to Susan, \"What've _you_\ngot to do?  Maybe it's something I could help at.\"\n\n\"No.  It's for Uncle George and me.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll go as far as the store.  Then--we'll see.\"\n\nThey were now in the business part of Main Street, were at\nWilson's dry goods store.  \"You might find it here,\" suggested\nthe innocent Susan to her cousin.\n\nRuth colored, veiled her eyes to hide their flash.  \"I've got to\ngo to the store first--to get some money,\" she hastily improvised.\n\nSam had been walking between the two girls.  He now changed to\nthe outside and, so, put himself next Susan alone, put Susan\nbetween him and Ruth.  The maneuver seemed to be a mere\npoliteness, but Ruth knew better.  What fate had intended as her\nlucky day was being changed into unlucky by this cousin of hers.\nRuth walked sullenly along, hot tears in her eyes and a choke in\nher throat, as she listened to Sam's flatterings of her cousin,\nand to Susan's laughing, delighted replies.  She tried to gather\nherself together, to think up something funny or at least\ninteresting with which to break into the _tête-à-tête_ and draw\nSam to herself.  She could think nothing but envious, hateful\nthoughts.  At the doors of Warham and Company, wholesale and\nretail grocers, the three halted.\n\n\"I guess I'll go to Vandermark's,\" said Ruth.  \"I really don't\nneed money.  Come on, Sam.\"\n\n\"No--I'm going back home.  I ought to see Lottie and father.  My,\nbut it's dull in this town!\"\n\n\"Well, so long,\" said Susan.  She nodded, sparkling of hair and\nskin and eyes, and went into the store.\n\nSam and Ruth watched her as she walked down the broad aisle\nbetween the counters.  From the store came a mingling of odors of\nfruit, of spices, of freshly ground coffee.  \"Susan's an awful\npretty girl, isn't she?\" declared Sam with rude enthusiasm.\n\n\"Indeed she is,\" replied Ruth as heartily--and with an honest if\ndiscouraged effort to feel enthusiastic.\n\n\"What a figure!  And she has such a good walk.  Most women walk horribly.\"\n\n\"Come on to Vandermark's with me and I'll stroll back with you,\"\noffered Ruth.  Sam was still gazing into the store where, far to\nthe rear, Susan could be seen; the graceful head, the gently\nswelling bust, the soft lines of the white dress, the pretty\nankles revealed by the short skirt--there was, indeed, a profile\nworth a man's looking at on a fine June day.  Ruth's eyes were\nupon Sam, handsome, dressed in the Eastern fashion, an ideal\nlover.  \"Come on, Sam,\" urged Ruth.\n\n\"No, thanks,\" he replied absently.  \"I'll go back.  Good luck!\"\nAnd not glancing at her, he lifted his straw hat with its band\nof Yale blue and set out.\n\nRuth moved slowly and disconsolately in the opposite direction.\nShe was ashamed of her thoughts; but shame never yet withheld\nanybody from being human in thought.  As she turned to enter\nVandermark's she glanced down the street.  There was Sam,\nreturned and going into her father's store.  She hesitated, could\ndevise no plan of action, hurried into the dry goods store.\nSinclair, the head salesman and the beau of Sutherland, was an\nespecial friend of hers.  The tall, slender, hungry-looking young\nman, devoured with ambition for speedy wealth, had no mind to\nneglect so easy an aid to that ambition as nature gave him in\nmaking him a lady-charmer.  He had resolved to marry either\nLottie Wright or Ruth Warham--Ruth preferred, because, while\nLottie would have many times more money, her skin made her a\nstiff dose for a young man brought up to the American tradition\nthat the face is the woman.  But that morning Sinclair exerted\nhis charms in vain.  Ruth was in a hurry, was distinctly rude,\ncut short what in other circumstances would have been a\nprolonged and delightful flirtation by tossing the sample on the\ncounter and asking him to do the matching for her and to send\nthe silk right away.  Which said, she fairly bolted from the store.\n\nShe arrived barely in time.  Young Wright was issuing from Warham\nand Company.  He smiled friendly enough, but Ruth knew where his\nthoughts were.  \"Get what you wanted?\" inquired he, and went on\nto explain:  \"I came back to find out if you and Susie were to be\nat home this evening.  Thought I'd call.\"\n\nRuth paled with angry dismay.  She was going to a party at the\nSinclairs'--one to which Susan was not invited.  \"Aren't you\ngoing to Sinclairs'?\" said she.\n\n\"I was.  But I thought I'd rather call.  Perhaps I'll go there later.\"\n\nHe was coming to call on Susan!  All the way down Main Street to\nthe Wright place Ruth fought against her mood of angry and\ndepressed silence, tried to make the best of her chance to\nimpress Sam.  But Sam was absent and humiliatingly near to curt.\nHe halted at his father's gate.  She halted also, searched the\ngrounds with anxious eyes for sign of Lottie that would give her\nthe excuse for entering.\n\n\"So long,\" said Sam.\n\n\"Do come to Sinclairs' early.  You always did dance so well.\"\n\n\"Oh, dancing bores me,\" said the blasé Sophomore.  \"But I'll be\nround before the shindy's over.  I've got to take Lot home.\"\n\nHe lifted the hat again with what both he and Ruth regarded as\na gesture of most elegant carelessness.  Ruth strolled\nreluctantly on, feeling as if her toilet had been splashed or\ncrushed.  As she entered the front door her mother, in a wrapper\nand curl papers, appeared at the head of the stairs.  \"Why!\" cried\nshe.  \"Where's the silk?  It's for your dress tonight, you know.\"\n\n\"It'll be along,\" was Ruth's answer, her tone dreary, her lip\nquivering.  \"I met Sam Wright.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed her mother.  \"He's back, is he?\"\n\nRuth did not reply.  She came on up the stairs, went into the\nsitting-room--the room where Doctor Stevens seventeen years\nbefore had torn the baby Susan from the very claws of death.  She\nflung herself down, buried her head in her arms upon that same\ntable.  She burst into a storm of tears.\n\n\"Why, dearie dear,\" cried her mother, \"whatever is the matter?\"\n\n\"It's wicked and hateful,\" sobbed the girl, \"but---- Oh, mamma, I\n_hate_ Susan!  She was along, and Sam hardly noticed me, and he's\ncoming here this evening to call.\"\n\n\"But you'll be at Sinclairs'!\" exclaimed Mrs. Warham.\n\n\"Not Susan,\" sobbed Ruth.  \"He wants to see only her.\"\n\nThe members of the Second Presbyterian Church, of which Fanny\nWarham was about the most exemplary and assiduous female member,\nwould hardly have recognized the face encircled by that triple\nrow of curl-papered locks, shinily plastered with quince-seed\nliquor.  She was at woman's second critical age, and the strange\nemotions working in her mind--of whose disorder no one had an\ninkling--were upon the surface now.  She ventured this freedom of\nfacial expression because her daughter's face was hid.  She did\nnot speak.  She laid a tender defending hand for an instant upon\nher daughter's shoulder--like the caress of love and\nencouragement the lioness gives her cub as she is about to give\nbattle for it.  Then she left the room.  She did not know what to\ndo, but she knew she must and would do something.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nTHE telephone was downstairs, in the rear end of the hall which\ndivided the lower floor into two equal parts.  But hardly had\nMrs. Warham given the Sinclairs' number to the exchange girl\nwhen Ruth called from the head of the stairs:\n\n\"What're you doing there, mamma?\"\n\n\"I'll tell Mrs. Sinclair you're sick and can't come.  Then I'll\nsend Susan in your place.\"\n\n\"Don't!\" cried Ruth, in an agitated, angry voice.  \"Ring off--quick!\"\n\n\"Now, Ruth, let me----\"\n\n\"Ring off!\" ordered Ruth.  \"You mustn't do that.  You'll have the\nwhole town talking about how I'm throwing myself at Sam's\nhead--and that I'm jealous of Susan.\"\n\nMrs. Warham said, \"Never mind\" into the telephone sender and\nhung up the receiver.  She was frightened, but not convinced.\nHers was a slow, old-fashioned mind, and to it the scheme it had\nworked out seemed a model of skillful duplicity.  But Ruth, of\nthe younger and subtler generation, realized instantly how\ntransparent the thing was.  Mrs. Warham was abashed but not\nangered by her daughter's curt contempt.\n\n\"It's the only way I can think of,\" said she.  \"And I still\ndon't see----\"\n\n\"Of course you don't,\" cut in Ruth, ruffled by the perilously\nnarrow escape from being the laughing stock of the town.  \"People\naren't as big fools as they used to be, mamma.  They don't\nbelieve nowadays everything that's told them.  There isn't\nanybody that doesn't know I'm never sick.  No--we'll have to----\"\n\nShe reflected a moment, pausing halfway down the stairs, while\nher mother watched her swollen and tear-stained face.\n\n\"We might send Susan away for the evening,\" suggested the mother.\n\n\"Yes,\" assented the daughter.  \"Papa could take her with him for\na drive to North Sutherland--to see the Provosts.  Then Sam'd\ncome straight on to the Sinclairs'.\"\n\n\"I'll call up your father.\"\n\n\"No!\" cried Ruth, stamping her foot.  \"Call up Mr. Provost, and\ntell him papa's coming.  Then you can talk with papa when he gets\nhome to dinner.\"\n\n\"But maybe----\"\n\n\"If that doesn't work out we can do something else this afternoon.\"\n\nThe mother and the daughter avoided each other's eyes.  Both felt\nmean and small, guilty toward Susan; but neither was for that\nreason disposed to draw back.  As Mrs. Warham was trying the new\ndress on her daughter, she said:\n\n\"Anyhow, Sam'd be wasting time on Susan.  He'd hang round her for\nno good.  She'd simply get talked about.  The poor child can't be\nlively or smile but what people begin to wonder if she's going\nthe way of--of Lorella.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" agreed Ruth, and both felt better.  \"Was Aunt\nLorella _very_ pretty, mamma?\"\n\n\"Lovely!\" replied Fanny, and her eyes grew tender, for she had\nadored Lorella.  \"You never saw such a complexion--like Susan's, only\nsnow-white.\" Nervously and hastily, \"Most as fine as yours, Ruthie.\"\n\nRuth gazed complacently into the mirror.  \"I'm glad I'm fair, and\nnot big,\" said she.\n\n\"Yes, indeed!  I like the womanly woman.  And so do men.\"\n\n\"Don't you think we ought to send Susan away to visit\nsomewhere?\" asked Ruth at the next opportunity for talk the\nfitting gave.  \"It's getting more and more--pointed--the way\npeople act.  And she's so sweet and good, I'd hate to have her\nfeelings hurt.\" In a burst of generosity, \"She's the most\nconsiderate human being I ever knew.  She'd give up anything\nrather than see someone else put out.  She's too much that way.\"\n\n\"We can't be too much that way,\" said Mrs. Warham in mechanical\nChristian reproof.\n\n\"Oh, I know,\" retorted Ruth, \"that's all very well for church\nand Sundays.  But I guess if you want to get along you've got to\nlook out for Number One. . . .  Yes, she ought to visit somewhere.\"\n\n\"I've been trying to think,\" said her mother.  \"She couldn't go\nany place but your Uncle Zeke's.  But it's so lonesome out there\nI haven't the heart to send her.  Besides, she wouldn't know what\nto make of it.\"\n\n\"What'd father say?\"\n\n\"That's another thing.\" Mrs. Warham had latterly grown\njealous--not without reason--of her husband's partiality for Susan.\n\nRuth sighed.  \"Oh, dear!\" cried she.  \"I don't know what to do.\nHow's she ever going to get married!\"\n\n\"If she'd only been a boy!\" said Mrs. Warham, on her knees,\ntaking the unevenness out of the front of the skirt.  \"A girl has\nto suffer for her mother's sins.\"\n\nRuth made no reply.  She smiled to herself--the comment of the\nyounger generation upon the older.  Sin it might have been; but,\nworse than that, it was a stupidity--to let a man make a fool of\nher.  Lorella must have been a poor weak-minded creature.\n\nBy dinner time Ruth had completely soothed and smoothed her\nvanity.  Sam had been caught by Susan simply because he had seen\nSusan before he saw her.\n\nAll that would be necessary was a good chance at him, and he\nwould never look at Susan again.  He had been in the East, where\nthe admired type was her own--refined, ladylike, the woman of\nthe dainty appearance and manners and tastes.  A brief\nundisturbed exposure to her charms and Susan would seem coarse\nand countrified to him.  There was no denying that Susan had\nstyle, but it was fully effective only when applied to a sunny\nfairy-like beauty such as hers.\n\nBut at midday, when Susan came in with Warham, Ruth's jealousy\nopened all her inward-bleeding wounds again.  Susan's merry eyes,\nher laughing mouth, her funny way of saying even commonplace\nthings--how could quiet, unobtrusive, ladylike charms such as\nRuth's have a chance if Susan were about?  She waited, silent and\nanxious, while her mother was having the talk with her father in the\nsitting-room.  Warham, mere man, was amused by his wife's scheming.\n\n\"Don't put yourself out, Fanny,\" said he.  \"If the boy wants Ruth\nand she wants him, why, well and good.  But you'll only make a\nmess interfering.  Let the young people alone.\"\n\n\"I'm surprised, George Warham,\" cried Fanny, \"that you can show\nso little sense and heart.\"\n\n\"To hear you talk, I'd think marriage was a business, like groceries.\"\n\nMrs. Warham thought it was, in a sense.  But she would never have\ndared say so aloud, even to her husband--or, rather, especially\nto her husband.  In matters of men and women he was thoroughly\ninnocent, with the simplicity of the old-time man of the small\ntown and the country; he fancied that, while in grocery matters\nand the like the world was full of guile, in matters of the\nheart it was idyllic, Arcadian, with never a thought of duplicity,\nexcept among a few obviously wicked and designing people.\n\n\"I guess we both want to see Ruth married well,\" was all she\ncould venture.\n\n\"I'd rather the girls stayed with us,\" declared Warham.  \"I'd\nhate to give them up.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" hastily agreed Fanny.  \"Still--it's the regular\norder of nature.\"\n\n\"Oh, Ruth'll marry--only too soon,\" said Warham.  \"And marry\nwell.  I'm not so sure, though, that marrying any of old Wright's\nbreed would be marrying what ought to be called well.  Money\nisn't everything--not by a long sight--though, of course, it's\ncomfortable.\"\n\n\"I never heard anything against Sam,\" protested Mrs. Warham.\n\n\"You've heard what I've heard--that he's wild and loose.  But\nthen you women like that in a man.\"\n\n\"We've got to put up with it, you mean,\" cried Fanny, indignant.\n\n\"Women like it,\" persisted Warham.  \"And I guess Sam's only\nsowing the usual wild oats, getting ready to settle.  No, mother,\nyou let Ruth alone.  If she wants him, she'll get him--she or Susan.\"\n\nMrs. Warham compressed her lips and lowered her eyes.  Ruth or\nSusan--as if it didn't matter which!  \"Susan isn't _ours_,\" she\ncould not refrain from saying.\n\n\"Indeed, she is!\" retorted George warmly.  \"Why, she couldn't be\nmore our own----\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly,\" interrupted Fanny.\n\nShe moved toward the door.  She saw that without revealing her\nentire scheme--hers and Ruth's--she could make no headway with\nGeorge.  And if she did reveal it he would sternly veto it.  So\nshe gave up that direction.  She went upstairs; George took his\nhat from the front hall rack and pushed open the screen door.  As\nhe appeared on the veranda Susan was picking dead leaves from\none of the hanging baskets; Ruth, seated in the hammock, hands\nin lap, her whole attitude intensely still, was watching her\nwith narrowed eyes.\n\n\"What's this I hear,\" cried Warham, laughing, \"about you two\ngirls setting your caps for Sam Wright?\" And his good-humored\nbrown eyes glanced at Ruth, passed on to Susan's wealth of wavy\ndark hair and long, rounded form, and lingered there.\n\nRuth lowered her eyes and compressed her lips, a trick she had\nborrowed from her mother along with the peculiarities of her\nmother's disposition that it fitted.  Susan flung a laughing\nglance over her shoulder at her uncle.  \"Not Ruth,\" said she.\n\"Only me.  I saw him first, so he's mine.  He's coming to see me\nthis evening.\"\n\n\"So I hear.  Well, the moon's full and your aunt and I'll not\ninterrupt--at least not till ten o'clock.  No callers on a child\nlike you after ten.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't think I'll be able to hold him that long.\"\n\n\"Don't you fret, Brownie.  But I mustn't make you vain.  Coming\nalong to the store?\"\n\n\"No.  Tomorrow,\" said Susan.  \"I can finish in the morning.  I'm\ngoing to wear my white dress with embroidery, and it's got to be\npressed--and that means I must do it myself.\"\n\n\"Poor Sam!  And I suppose, when he calls, you'll come down as if\nyou'd put on any old thing and didn't care whether he came or\nnot.  And you'll have primped for an hour--and he, too--shaving\nand combing and trying different ties.\"\n\nSusan sparkled at the idea of a young man, and _such_ a young\nman, taking trouble for her.  Ruth, pale, kept her eyes down and\nher lips compressed.  She was picturing the gallant appearance\nthe young Sophomore from Yale, away off in the gorgeous\nfashionable East, would make as he came in at that gate yonder\nand up the walk and seated himself on the veranda--with Susan!\nEvidently her mother had failed; Susan was not to be taken away.\n\nWhen Warham departed down the walk Ruth rose; she could not bear\nbeing alone with her triumphant rival--triumphant because\nunconscious.  She knew that to get Sam to herself all she would\nhave to do would be to hint to Susan, the generous, what she\nwanted.  But pride forbade that.  As her hand was on the knob of\nthe screen door, Susan said:  \"Why don't you like Sam?\"\n\n\"Oh, I think he's stuck-up.  He's been spoiled in the East.\"\n\n\"Why, I don't see any sign of it.\"\n\n\"You were too flattered by his talking to you,\" said Ruth, with a\nsweet-sour little laugh--an asp of a sneer hid in a basket of flowers.\n\nSusan felt the sting; but, seeing only the flowers, did not\ndream whence it had come.  \"It _was_ nice, wasn't it?\" said she,\ngayly.  \"Maybe you're right about him, but I can't help liking\nhim.  You must admit he's handsome.\"\n\n\"He has a bad look in his eyes,\" replied Ruth.  Such rage against\nSusan was swelling within her that it seemed to her she would\nfaint if she did not release at least part of it.  \"You want to\nlook out for him, Susie,\" said she, calmly and evenly.  \"You\ndon't want to take what he says seriously.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Susan, quite honestly, though she, no more\nthan the next human being, could avoid taking seriously whatever\nwas pleasantly flattering.\n\n\"He'd never think of marrying you.\" Ruth trembled before and\nafter delivering this venomous shaft.\n\n\"Marrying!\" cried Susan, again quite honestly.  \"Why, I'm only seventeen.\"\n\nRuth drew a breath of relief.  The shaft had glanced off the\narmor of innocence without making the faintest dent.  She rushed\ninto the house.  She did not dare trust herself with her cousin.\nWhat might the demon within her tempt her to say next?\n\n\"Come up, Ruth!\" called her mother.  \"The dress is ready for the\nlast try-on.  I think it's going to hang beautifully.\"\n\nRuth dragged herself up the stairs, lagged into the\nsitting-room, gazed at the dress with a scowl.  \"What did father\nsay?\" she asked.\n\n\"It's no use trying to do anything with your father.\"\n\nRuth flung herself in a corner of the sofa.\n\n\"The only thing I can think of,\" said her mother, humbly and\ntimidly, \"is phone the Sinclairs as I originally set out to do.\"\n\n\"And have the whole town laughing at me. . . .  Oh, what do I\ncare, anyhow!\"\n\n\"Arthur Sinclair's taller and a sight handsomer.  Right in the\nface, Sam's as plain as Dick's hatband.  His looks is all clothes\nand polish--and mighty poor polish, I think.  Arthur's got rise\nin him, too, while Sam--well, I don't know what'd become of him\nif old Wright lost his money.\"\n\nBut Arthur, a mere promise, seemed poor indeed beside Sam, the\nactually arrived.  To marry Sam would be to step at once into\ngrandeur; to marry Arthur would mean years of struggle.\nBesides, Arthur was heavy, at least seemed heavy to light Ruth,\nwhile Sam was her ideal of gay elegance.  \"I _detest_ Arthur\nSinclair,\" she now announced.\n\n\"You can get Sam if you want him,\" said her mother confidently.  \"One\nevening with a mere child like Susie isn't going to amount to much.\"\n\nRuth winced.  \"Do you suppose I don't know that?\" cried she.\n\"What makes me so mad is his impudence--coming here to see her\nwhen he wouldn't marry her or take her any place.  It's insulting\nto us all.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't think it's as bad as all that, Ruthie,\" soothed her\nmother, too simple-minded to accept immediately this clever\nsubtlety of self-deception.\n\n\"You know this town--how people talk.  Why, his sister----\" and\nshe related their conversation at the gate that morning.\n\n\"You ought to have sat on her hard, Ruth,\" said Mrs. Warham,\nwith dangerously sparkling eyes.  \"No matter what we may think\nprivately, it gives people a low opinion of us to----\"\n\n\"Don't I know that!\" shrilled Ruth.  She began to weep.  \"I'm\nashamed of myself.\"\n\n\"But we must try the dress on.\" Mrs. Warham spread the skirt,\nusing herself as form.  \"Isn't it too lovely!\"\n\nRuth dried her eyes as she gazed.  The dress was indeed lovely.\nBut her pleasure in it was shadowed by the remembrance that most\nof the loveliness was due to Susan's suggestions.  Still, she\ntried it on, and felt better.  She would linger until Sam came,\nwould exhibit herself to him; and surely he would not tarry long\nwith Susan.  This project improved the situation greatly.  She\nbegan her toilet for the evening at once, though it was only\nthree o'clock.  Susan finished her pressing and started to dress\nat five--because she knew Ruth would be appealing to her to come\nin and help put the finishing touches to the toilet for the\nparty.  And, sure enough, at half-past five, before she had\nnearly finished, Ruth, with a sneaking humility, begged her to\ncome \"for half a minute--if you don't mind--and have got time.\"\n\nSusan did Ruth's hair over, made her change to another color of\nstockings and slippers, put the dress on her, did nearly an\nhour's refitting and redraping.  Both were late for supper; and\nafter supper Susan had to make certain final amendments to the\nwonderful toilet, and then get herself ready.  So it was Ruth\nalone who went down when Sam Wright came.  \"My, but you do look\nall to the good, Ruth!\" cried Sam.  And his eyes no less than his\ntone showed that he meant it.  He hadn't realized what a soft\nwhite neck the blond cousin had, or how perfectly her shoulders\nrounded into her slim arms.  As Ruth moved to depart, he said:\n\"Don't be in such a rush.  Wait till Susie finishes her primping\nand comes down.\"\n\n\"She had to help me,\" said Ruth, with a righteousness she could\njustly plume herself upon.  \"That's why she's late.  No, I must\nget along.\" She was wise enough to resist the temptation to\nimprove upon an already splendid impression.  \"Come as soon as\nyou can.\"\n\n\"I'll be there in a few minutes,\" Sam assured her convincingly.\n\"Save some dances for me.\"\n\nRuth went away happy.  At the gate she glanced furtively back.\nSam was looking after her.  She marched down the street with\nlight step.  \"I must wear low-necked dresses more in the\nevenings,\" she said to herself.  \"It's foolish for a girl to\nhide a good neck.\"\n\nSam, at the edge of the veranda, regretting his promise to call\non Susan, was roused by her voice:  \"Did you ever see anything as\nlovely as Ruth?\"\n\nSam's regret vanished the instant he looked at her, and the\ngreedy expression came into his sensual, confident young face.\n\"She's a corker,\" said he.  \"But I'm content to be where I am.\"\n\nSusan's dress was not cut out in the neck, was simply of the\ncollarless kind girls of her age wear.  It revealed the smooth,\nvoluptuous yet slender column of her throat.  And her arms, bare\nto just above the elbows, were exquisite.  But Susan's\nfascination did not lie in any or in all of her charms, but in\nthat subtlety of magnetism which account for all the sensational\nphenomena of the relations of men and women.  She was a clever\ngirl--clever beyond her years, perhaps--though in this day\nseventeen is not far from fully developed womanhood.  But even\nhad she been silly, men would have been glad to linger on and on\nunder the spell of the sex call which nature had subtly woven\ninto the texture of her voice, into the glance of her eyes, into\nthe delicate emanations of her skin.\n\nThey talked of all manner of things--games and college East and\nWest--the wonders of New York--the weather, finally.  Sam was\nevery moment of the time puzzling how to bring up the one\nsubject that interested both above all others, that interested\nhim to the exclusion of all others.  He was an ardent student of\nthe game of man and woman, had made considerable progress at\nit--remarkable progress, in view of his bare twenty years.  He\nhad devised as many \"openings\" as an expert chess player.  None\nseemed to fit this difficult case how to make love to a girl of\nhis own class whom his conventional, socially ambitious nature\nforbade him to consider marrying.  As he observed her in the\nmoonlight, he said to himself:  \"I've got to look out or I'll\nmake a damn fool of myself with her.\" For his heady passion was\nfast getting the better of those prudent instincts he had\ninherited from a father who almost breathed by calculation.\n\nWhile he was still struggling for an \"opening,\" Susan eager to\nhelp him but not knowing how, there came from the far interior\nof the house three distant raps.  \"Gracious!\" exclaimed Susan.\n\"That's Uncle George.  It must be ten o'clock.\" With frank\nregret, \"I'm so sorry.  I thought it was early.\"\n\n\"Yes, it did seem as if I'd just come,\" said Sam.  Her shy\ninnocence was contagious.  He felt an awkward country lout.\n\"Well, I suppose I must go.\"\n\n\"But you'll come again--sometime?\" she asked wistfully.  It was\nher first real beau--the first that had interested her--and what\na dream lover of a beau he looked, standing before her in that\nwonderful light!\n\n\"Come?  Rather!\" exclaimed he in a tone of enthusiasm that could\nnot but flatter her into a sort of intoxication.  \"I'd have hard\nwork staying away.  But Ruth--she'll always be here.\"\n\n\"Oh, she goes out a lot--and I don't.\"\n\n\"Will you telephone me--next time she's to be out?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed she with a hesitation that was explained when she\nadded:  \"But don't think you've got to come. . . .  Oh, I must go in!\"\n\n\"Good night--Susie.\" Sam held out his hand.  She took it with a\nqueer reluctance.  She felt nervous, afraid, as if there were\nsomething uncanny lurking somewhere in those moonlight shadows.\nShe gently tried to draw her hand away, but he would not let\nher.  She made a faint struggle, then yielded.  It was so\nwonderful, the sense of the touch of his hand.  \"Susie!\" he said\nhoarsely.  And she knew he felt as she did.  Before she realized\nit his arms were round her, and his lips had met hers.  \"You\ndrive me crazy,\" he whispered.\n\nBoth were trembling; she had become quite cold--her cheeks, her hand,\nher body even.  \"You mustn't,\" she murmured, drawing gently away.\n\n\"You set me crazy,\" he repeated.  \"Do you--love me--a little?\"\n\n\"Oh, I must go!\" she pleaded.  Tears were glistening in her long dark\nlashes.  The sight of them maddened him.  \"Do you--Susie?\" he pleaded.\n\n\"I'm--I'm--very young,\" she stammered.\n\n\"Yes--yes--I know,\" he assented eagerly.  \"But not too young to\nlove, Susie?  No.  Because you do--don't you?\"\n\nThe moonlit world seemed a fairyland.  \"Yes,\" she said softly.  \"I\nguess so.  I must go.  I must.\"\n\nAnd moved beyond her power to control herself, she broke from\nhis detaining hand and fled into the house.  She darted up to her\nroom, paused in the middle of the floor, her hands clasped over\nher wildly beating heart.  When she could move she threw open the\nshutters and went out on the balcony.  She leaned against the\nwindow frame and gazed up at the stars, instinctively seeking\nthe companionship of the infinite.  Curiously enough, she thought\nlittle about Sam.  She was awed and wonderstruck before the\nstrange mysterious event within her, the opening up, the\nflowering of her soul.  These vast emotions, where did they come\nfrom?  What were they?  Why did she long to burst into laughter,\nto burst into tears?  Why did she do neither, but simply stand\nmotionless, with the stars blazing and reeling in the sky and\nher heart beating like mad and her blood surging and ebbing?  Was\nthis--love?  Yes--it must be love.  Oh, how wonderful love\nwas--and how sad--and how happy beyond all laughter--and how\nsweet!  She felt an enormous tenderness for everybody and for\neverything, for all the world--an overwhelming sense of beauty\nand goodness.  Her lips were moving.  She was amazed to find she\nwas repeating the one prayer she knew, the one Aunt Fanny had\ntaught her in babyhood.  Why should she find herself praying?\nLove--love love!  She was a woman and she loved!  So this was what\nit meant to be a woman; it meant to love!\n\nShe was roused by the sound of Ruth saying good night to someone\nat the gate, invisible because of the intervening foliage.  Why,\nit must be dreadfully late.  The Dipper had moved away round to\nthe south, and the heat of the day was all gone, and the air was\nfull of the cool, scented breath of leaves and flowers and\ngrass.  Ruth's lights shone out upon the balcony.  Susan turned to\nslip into her own room.  But Ruth heard, called out peevishly:\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Only me,\" cried Susan.\n\nShe longed to go in and embrace Ruth, and kiss her.  She would\nhave liked to ask Ruth to let her sleep with her, but she felt\nRuth wouldn't understand.\n\n\"What are you doing out there?\" demanded Ruth.  \"It's 'way after one.\"\n\n\"Oh--dear--I must go to bed,\" cried Susan.  Ruth's voice somehow\nseemed to be knocking and tumbling her new dream-world.\n\n\"What time did Sam Wright leave here?\" asked Ruth.\n\nShe was standing in her window now.  Susan saw that her face\nlooked tired and worn, almost homely.\n\n\"At ten,\" she replied.  \"Uncle George knocked on the banister.\"\n\n\"Are you sure it was ten?\" said Ruth sharply.\n\n\"I guess so.  Yes--it was ten.  Why?\"\n\n\"Oh--nothing.\"\n\n\"Was he at Sinclairs'?\"\n\n\"He came as it was over.  He and Lottie brought me home.\" Ruth\nwas eyeing her cousin evilly.  \"How did you two get on?\"\n\nSusan flushed from head to foot.  \"Oh--so-so,\" she answered, in\nan uncertain voice.\n\n\"I don't know why he didn't come to Sinclairs',\" snapped Ruth.\n\nSusan flushed again--a delicious warmth from head to foot.  She\nknew why.  So he, too, had been dreaming alone.  Love!  Love!\n\n\"What are you smiling at?\" cried Ruth crossly.\n\n\"Was I smiling?. . .  Do you want me to help you undress?\"\n\n\"No,\" was the curt answer.  \"Good night.\"\n\n\"Please let me unhook it, at least,\" urged Susan, following Ruth\ninto her room.\n\nRuth submitted.\n\n\"Did you have a good time?\" asked Susan.\n\n\"Of course,\" snapped Ruth.  \"What made you think I didn't?\"\n\n\"Don't be a silly, dear.  I didn't think so.\"\n\n\"I had an awful time--awful!\"\n\nRuth began to sob, turned fiercely on Susan.  \"Leave me alone!\"\nshe cried.  \"I hate to have you touch me.\" The dress was, of\ncourse, entirely unfastened in the back.\n\n\"You had a quarrel with Arthur?\" asked Susan with sympathy.  \"But\nyou know he can't keep away from you.  Tomorrow----\"\n\n\"Be careful, Susan, how you let Sam Wright hang around you,\"\ncried Ruth, with blazing eyes and trembling lips.  \"You be\ncareful--that's all I've got to say.\"\n\n\"Why, what do you mean?\" asked Susan wonderingly.\n\n\"Be careful!  He'd never think for a minute of marrying you.\"\n\nThe words meant nothing to Susan; but the tone stabbed into her\nheart.  \"Why not?\" she said.\n\nRuth looked at her cousin, hung her head in shame.  \"Go--go!\" she\nbegged.  \"Please go.  I'm a bad girl--bad--_bad_!  Go!\" And, crying\nhysterically, she pushed amazed Susan through the connecting\ndoor, closed and bolted it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nWHEN Fanny Warham was young her mother--compelled by her\nfather--roused--\"routed out\"--the children at half-past six on\nweek days and at seven on Sundays for prayers and breakfast, no\nmatter what time they had gone to bed the night before.  The\nhorror of this made such an impression upon her that she never\npermitted Ruth and Susan to be awakened; always they slept until\nthey had \"had their sleep out.\" Regularity was no doubt an\nexcellent thing for health and for moral discipline; but the\nbest rule could be carried to foolish extremes.  Until the last\nyear Mrs. Warham had made her two girls live a life of the\nstrictest simplicity and regularity, with the result that they\nwere the most amazingly, soundly, healthy girls in Sutherland.\nAnd the regimen still held, except when they had company in the\nevening or went out--and Mrs. Warham saw to it that there was\nnot too much of that sort of thing.  In all her life thus far\nSusan had never slept less than ten hours, rarely less than twelve.\n\nIt lacked less than a minute of ten o'clock the morning after\nSam's call when Susan's eyes opened upon her simple, pale-gray\nbedroom, neat and fresh.  She looked sleepily at the little clock\non the night stand.\n\n\"Mercy me!\" she cried.  And her bare feet were on the floor and\nshe was stretching her lithe young body, weak from the\nrelaxation of her profound sleep.\n\nShe heard someone stirring in Ruth's room; instantly Ruth's\nremark, \"He'd never think for a minute of marrying you,\" popped\ninto her head.  It still meant nothing to her.  She could not have\nexplained why it came back or why she fell to puzzling over it\nas if it held some mysterious meaning.  Perhaps the reason was\nthat from early childhood there had been accumulating in some\ndusky chamber of her mind stray happenings and remarks, all\nbaring upon the unsuspected secret of her birth and the\nunsuspected strangeness of her position in the world where\neveryone else was definitely placed and ticketed.  She was\nwondering about Ruth's queer hysterical outburst, evidently the\nresult of a quarrel with Arthur Sinclair.  \"I guess Ruth cares\nmore for him than she lets on,\" thought she.  This love that had\ncome to her so suddenly and miraculously made her alert for\nsigns of love elsewhere.\n\nShe went to the bolted connecting door; she could not remember\nwhen it had ever been bolted before, and she felt forlorn and\nshut out.  \"Ruth!\" she called.\n\n\"Is that you?\"\n\nA brief silence, then a faint \"Yes.\"\n\n\"May I come in?\"\n\n\"You'd better take your bath and get downstairs.\"\n\nThis reminded her that she was hungry.  She gathered her\nunderclothes together, and with the bundle in her arms darted\nacross the hall into the bathroom.  The cold water acted as\nchampagne promises to act but doesn't.  She felt giddy with\nhealth and happiness.  And the bright sun was flooding the\nbathroom, and the odors from the big bed of hyacinths in the\nside lawn scented the warm breeze from the open window.  When she\ndashed back to her room she was singing, and her singing voice\nwas as charming as her speaking voice promised.  A few minutes\nand her hair had gone up in careless grace and she was clad in\na fresh dress of tan linen, full in the blouse.  This, with her\ntan stockings and tan slippers and the radiant youth of her\nface, gave her a look of utter cleanness and freshness that was\nexceedingly good to see.\n\n\"I'm ready,\" she called.\n\nThere was no answer; doubtless Ruth had already descended.  She\nrushed downstairs and into the dining-room.  No one was at the\nlittle table set in one of the windows in readiness for the late\nbreakfasters.\n\nMolly came, bringing cocoa, a cereal, hot biscuit and crab-apple\npreserves, all attractively arranged on a large tray.\n\n\"I didn't bring much, Miss Susie,\" she apologized.  \"It's so\nlate, and I don't want you to spoil your dinner.  We're going to\nhave the grandest chicken that ever came out of an egg.\"\n\nSusan surveyed the tray with delighted eyes.  \"That's plenty,\" she\nsaid, \"if you don't talk too much about the chicken.  Where's Ruth?\"\n\n\"She ain't coming down.  She's got a headache.  It was that salad\nfor supper over to Sinclairs' last night.  Salad ain't fit for a\ndog to eat, nohow--that's _my_ opinion.  And at night--it's sure\nto bust your face out or give you the headache or both.\"\n\nSusan ate with her usual enthusiasm, thinking the while of Sam\nand wondering how she could contrive to see him.  She remembered\nher promise to her uncle.  She had not eaten nearly so much as\nshe wanted.  But up she sprang and in fifteen minutes was on her\nway to the store.  She had seen neither Ruth nor her aunt.\n\"_He_'ll be waiting for me to pass,\" she thought.  And she was not\ndisappointed.  There he stood, at the footpath gate into his\nfather's place.  He had arrayed himself in a blue and white\nflannel suit, white hat and shoes; a big expensive-looking\ncigarette adorned his lips.  The Martins, the Delevans, the\nCastles and the Bowens, neighbors across the way, were watching\nhim admiringly through the meshes of lace window curtains.  She\nexpected that he would come forward eagerly.  Instead, he\ncontinued to lean indolently on the gate, as if unaware of her\napproach.  And when she was close at hand, his bow and smile\nwere, so it seemed to her, almost coldly polite.  Into her eyes\ncame a confused, hurt expression.\n\n\"Susie--sweetheart,\" he said, the voice in as astonishing\ncontrast as the words to his air of friendly indifference.\n\"They're watching us from the windows all around here.\"\n\n\"Oh--yes,\" assented she, as if she understood.  But she didn't.\nIn Sutherland the young people were not so mindful of gossip,\nwhich it was impossible to escape, anyhow.  Still--off there in\nthe East, no doubt, they had more refined ways; without a doubt,\nwhatever Sam did was the correct thing.\n\n\"Do you still care as you did last night?\" he asked.  The effect\nof his words upon her was so obvious that he glanced nervously\nround.  It was delightful to be able to evoke a love like this;\nbut he did wish others weren't looking.\n\n\"I'm going to Uncle's store,\" she said.  \"I'm late.\"\n\n\"I'll walk part of the way with you,\" he volunteered, and they\nstarted on.  \"That--that kiss,\" he stammered.  \"I can feel it yet.\"\n\nShe blushed deeply, happily.  Her beauty made him tingle.  \"So can\nI,\" she said.\n\nThey walked in silence several squares.  \"When will I see you\nagain?\" he asked.  \"Tonight?\"\n\n\"Yes--do come down.  But--Ruth'll be there.  I believe Artie\nSinclair's coming.\"\n\n\"Oh, that counter-jumper?\"\n\nShe looked at him in surprise.  \"He's an awfully nice fellow,\"\nsaid she.  \"About the nicest in town.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" replied Sam elaborately.  \"I beg your pardon.  They\nthink differently about those things in the East.\"\n\n\"What thing?\"\n\n\"No matter.\"\n\nSam, whose secret dream was to marry some fashionable Eastern\nwoman and cut a dash in Fifth Avenue life, had no intention of\nexplaining what was what to one who would not understand, would\nnot approve, and would be made auspicious of him.  \"I suppose\nRuth and Sinclair'll pair off and give us a chance.\"\n\n\"You'll come?\"\n\n\"Right after din--supper, I mean.  In the East we have dinner in\nthe evening.\"\n\n\"Isn't that queer!\" exclaimed Susan.  But she was thinking of the\njoys in store for her at the close of the day.\n\n\"I must go back now,\" said Sam.  Far up the street he saw his\nsister's pony cart coming.\n\n\"You might as well walk to the store.\" It seemed to her that they\nboth had ever so much to say to each other, and had said nothing.\n\n\"No.  I can't go any further.  Good-by--that is, till tonight.\"\n\nHe was red and stammering.  As they shook hands emotion made them\nspeechless.  He stumbled awkwardly as he turned to leave, became\nstill more hotly self-conscious when he saw the grin on the\nfaces of the group of loungers at a packing case near the curb.\nSusan did not see the loafers, did not see anything distinctly.\nHer feet sought the uneven brick sidewalk uncertainly, and the\nblood was pouring into her cheeks, was steaming in her brain,\nmaking a red mist before her eyes.  She was glad he had left her.\nThe joy of being with him was so keen that it was pain.  Now she\ncould breathe freely and could dream--dream--dream.  She made\nblunder after blunder in working over the accounts with her\nuncle, and he began to tease her.\n\n\"You sure are in love, Brownie,\" declared he.\nHer painful but happy blush delighted him.\n\n\"Tell me all about it?\"\n\nShe shook her head, bending it low to hide her color.\n\n\"No?. . .  Sometime?\"\n\nShe nodded.  She was glancing shyly and merrily at him now.\n\n\"Well, some hold that first love's best.  Maybe so.  But it seems\nto me any time's good enough.  Still--the first time's mighty fine\neh?\" He sighed.  \"My, but it's good to be young!\" And he patted\nher thick wavy hair.\n\nIt did not leak out until supper that Sam was coming.  Warham\nsaid to Susan, \"While Ruth's looking out for Artie, you and I'll\nhave a game or so of chess, Brownie.\" Susan colored violently.\n\"What?\" laughed Warham.  \"Are _you_ going to have a beau too?\"\n\nSusan felt two pairs of feminine eyes pounce--hostile eyes,\nsavagely curious.  She paled with fright as queer, as\nunprecedented, as those hostile glances.  It seemed to her that\nshe had done or was about to do something criminal.  She could\nnot speak.\n\nAn awful silence, then her aunt--she no longer seemed her loving\naunt--asked in an ominous voice:  \"Is someone coming to see you, Susan?\"\n\n\"Sam Wright\"--stammered Susan--\"I saw him this morning--he was\nat their gate--and he said--I think he's coming.\"\n\nA dead silence--Warham silent because he was eating, but the two\nothers not for that reason.\n\nSusan felt horribly guilty, and for no reason.  \"I'd have spoken\nof it before,\" she said, \"but there didn't seem to be any\nchance.\" She had the instinct of fine shy nature to veil the\nsoul; she found it hard to speak of anything as sacred as this\nlove of hers and whatever related to it.\n\n\"I can't allow this, Susie,\" said her aunt, with lips tightly\ndrawn against the teeth.  \"You are too young.\"\n\n\"Oh, come now, mother,\" cried Warham, good-humoredly.  \"That's\nfoolishness.  Let the young folks have a good time.  You didn't\nthink you were too young at Susie's age.\"\n\n\"You don't understand, George,\" said Fanny after she had given\nhim a private frown.  Susie's gaze was on the tablecloth.  \"I\ncan't permit Sam to come here to see Susie.\"\n\nRuth's eyes were down also.  About her lips was a twitching that\nmeant a struggle to hide a pleased smile.\n\n\"I've no objection to Susie's having boys of her own age come to\nsee her,\" continued Mrs. Warham in the same precise, restrained\nmanner.  \"But Sam is too old.\"\n\n\"Now, mother----\"\n\nMrs. Warham met his eyes steadily.  \"I must protect my sister's\nchild, George,\" she said.  At last she had found what she felt\nwas a just reason for keeping Sam away from Susan, so her tone\nwas honest and strong.\n\nWarham lowered his gaze.  He understood.  \"Oh--as you think best,\nFan; I didn't mean to interfere,\" said he awkwardly.  He turned\non Susan with his affection in his eyes.  \"Well, Brownie, it\nlooks like chess with your old uncle, doesn't it?\"\n\nSusan's bosom was swelling, her lip trembling.  \"I--I----\" she\nbegan.  She choked back the sobs, faltered out:  \"I don't think I\ncould, Uncle,\" and rushed from the room.\n\nThere was an uncomfortable pause.  Then Warham said, \"I must say,\nFan, I think--if you had to do it--you might have spared the\ngirl's feelings.\"\n\nMrs. Warham felt miserable about it also.  \"Susie took me by\nsurprise,\" she apologized.  Then, defiantly, \"And what else can\nI do?  You know he doesn't come for any good.\"\n\nWarham stared in amazement.  \"Now, what does _that_ mean?\" he demanded.\n\n\"You know very well what it means,\" retorted his wife.\n\nHer tone made him understand.  He reddened, and with too\nblustering anger brought his fist down on the table.\n\n\"Susan's our daughter.  She's Ruth's sister.\"\n\nRuth pushed back her chair and stood up.  Her expression made her\nlook much older than she was.  \"I wish you could induce the rest\nof the town to think that, papa,\" said she.  \"It'd make my\nposition less painful.\" And she, too, left the room.\n\n\"What's she talking about?\" asked Warham.\n\n\"It's true, George,\" replied Fanny with trembling lip.  \"It's all\nmy fault--insisting on keeping her.  I might have known!\"\n\n\"I think you and Ruth must be crazy.  I've seen no sign.\"\n\n\"Have you seen any of the boys calling on Susan since she shot\nup from a child to a girl?  Haven't you noticed she isn't invited\nany more except when it can't be avoided?\"\n\nWarham's face was fiery with rage.  He looked helplessly,\nfuriously about.  But he said nothing.  To fight public sentiment\nwould be like trying to thrust back with one's fists an oncreeping\nfog.  Finally he cried, \"It's too outrageous to talk about.\"\n\n\"If I only knew what to do!\" moaned Fanny.\n\nA long silence, while Warham was grasping the fullness of the\nmeaning, the frightful meaning, in these revelations so\nastounding to him.  At last he said:\n\n\"Does _she_ realize?\"\n\n\"I guess so . . .  I don't know . . .  I don't believe she does.\nShe's the most innocent child that ever grew up.\"\n\n\"If I had a chance, I'd sell out and move away.\"\n\n\"Where?\" said his wife.  \"Where would people accept--her?\"\n\nWarham became suddenly angry again.  \"I don't believe it!\" he\ncried, his look and tone contradicting his words.  \"You've been\nmaking a mountain out of a molehill.\"\n\nAnd he strode from the room, flung on his hat and went for a\nwalk.  As Mrs. Warham came from the dining-room a few minutes\nlater, Ruth appeared in the side veranda doorway.  \"I think I'll\ntelephone Arthur to come tomorrow evening instead,\" said she.\n\"He'd not like it, with Sam here too.\"\n\n\"That would be better,\" assented her mother.  \"Yes, I'd telephone\nhim if I were you.\"\n\nThus it came about that Susan, descending the stairs to the\nlibrary to get a book, heard Ruth say into the telephone in her\nsweetest voice, \"Yes--tomorrow evening, Arthur.  Some others are\ncoming--the Wrights.  You'd have to talk to Lottie . . .  I don't\nblame you. . . .  Tomorrow evening, then.  So sorry.  Good-by.\"\n\nThe girl on the stairway stopped short, shrank against the wall.\nA moment, and she hastily reascended, entered her room, closed\nthe door.  Love had awakened the woman; and the woman was not so\nunsuspecting, so easily deceived as the child had been.  She\nunderstood what her cousin and her aunt were about; they were\ntrying to take her lover from her!  She understood her aunt's\nlooks and tones, her cousin's temper and hysteria.  She sat down\nupon the floor and cried with a breaking heart.  The injustice of\nit!  The meanness of it!  The wickedness of a world where even her\nsweet cousin, even her loving aunt were wicked!  She sat there on\nthe floor a long time, abandoned to the misery of a first\nshattered illusion, a misery the more cruel because never before\nhad either cousin or aunt said or done anything to cause her\nreal pain.  The sound of voices coming through the open window\nfrom below made her start up and go out on the balcony.  She\nleaned over the rail.  She could not see the veranda for the\nmasses of creeper, but the voices were now quite plain in the\nstillness.  Ruth's voice gay and incessant.  Presently a man's\nvoice _his_--and laughing!  Then his voice speaking--then the two\nvoices mingled--both talking at once, so eager were they!  Her\nlover--and Ruth was stealing him from her!  Oh, the baseness, the\ntreachery!  And her aunt was helping!. . .  Sore of heart,\nutterly forlorn, she sat in the balcony hammock, aching with\nlove and jealousy.  Every now and then she ran in and looked at\nthe clock.  He was staying on and on, though he must have learned\nshe was not coming down.  She heard her uncle and aunt come up to\nbed.  Now the piano in the parlor was going.  First it was Ruth\nsinging one of her pretty love songs in that clear small voice\nof hers.  Then Sam played and sang--how his voice thrilled her!\nAgain it was Ruthie singing--\"Sweet Dream Faces\"--Susan began to\nsob afresh.  She could see Ruth at the piano, how beautiful she\nlooked--and that song--it would be impossible for him not to be\nimpressed.  She felt the jealousy of despair. . . .  Ten\no'clock--half-past--eleven o'clock!  She heard them at the edge of\nthe veranda--so, at last he was going.  She was able to hear\ntheir words now:\n\n\"You'll be up for the tennis in the morning?\" he was saying.\n\n\"At ten,\" replied Ruth.\n\n\"Of course Susie's asked, too,\" he said--and his voice sounded\ncareless, not at all earnest.\n\n\"Certainly,\" was her cousin's reply.  \"But I'm not sure she can come.\"\n\nIt was all the girl at the balcony rail could do to refrain from\ncrying out a protest.  But Sam was saying to Ruth:\n\n\"Well--good night.  Haven't had so much fun in a long time.  May\nI come again?\"\n\n\"If you don't, I'll think you were bored.\"\n\n\"Bored!\" He laughed.  \"That's too ridiculous.  See you in the\nmorning.  Good night. . . .  Give my love to Susie, and tell her\nI was sorry not to see her.\"\n\nSusan was all in a glow as her cousin answered, \"I'll tell her.\"\ndoubtless Sam didn't note it, but Susan heard the constraint,\nthe hypocrisy in that sweet voice.\n\nShe watched him stroll down to the gate under the arch of boughs\ndimly lit by the moon.  She stretched her arms passionately\ntoward him.  Then she went in to go to bed.  But at the sound of\nRuth humming gayly in the next room, she realized that she could\nnot sleep with her heart full of evil thoughts.  She must have it\nout with her cousin.  She knocked on the still bolted door.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Ruth coldly.\n\n\"Let me in,\" answered Susan.  \"I've got to see you.\"\n\n\"Go to bed, Susie.  It's late.\"\n\n\"You must let me in.\"\n\nThe bolt shot back.  \"All right.  And please unhook my\ndress--there's a dear.\"\n\nSusan opened the door, stood on the threshold, all her dark\npassion in her face.  \"Ruth!\" she cried.\n\nRuth had turned her back, in readiness for the service the need\nof which had alone caused her to unbolt the door.  At that swift,\nfierce ejaculation she started, wheeled round.  At sight of that\nwild anger she paled.  \"Why, Susie!\" she gasped.\n\n\"I've found you out!\" raged Susan.  \"You're trying to steal him\nfrom me--you and Aunt Fanny.  It isn't fair!  I'll not stand it!\"\n\n\"What _are_ you talking about?\" cried Ruth.  \"You must have lost\nyour senses.\"\n\n\"I'll not stand it,\" Susan repeated, advancing threateningly \"He\nloves me and I love him.\"\n\nRuth laughed.  \"You foolish girl!  Why, he cares nothing about you.\nThe idea of your having your head turned by a little politeness!\"\n\n\"He loves me he told me so.  And I love him.  I told him so.  He's\nmine!  You shan't take him from me!\"\n\n\"He told you he loved you?\"\n\nRuth's eyes were gleaming and her voice was shrill with hate.\n\"He told you _that_?\"\n\n\"Yes--he did!\"\n\n\"I don't believe you.\"\n\n\"We love each other,\" cried the dark girl.  \"He came to see _me_.\nYou've got Arthur Sinclair.  You shan't take him away!\"\n\nThe two girls, shaking with fury, were facing each other, were\nlooking into each other's eyes.  \"If Sam Wright told you he loved\nyou,\" said Ruth, with the icy deliberateness of a cold-hearted\nanger, \"he was trying to--to make a fool of you.  You ought to be\nashamed of yourself.  _We_'re trying to save you.\"\n\n\"He and I are engaged!\" declared Susan.  \"You shan't take\nhim--and you can't!  He _loves_ me!\"\n\n\"Engaged!\" jeered Ruth.  \"Engaged!\" she laughed, pretending not\nto believe, yet believing.  She was beside herself with jealous\nanger.  \"Yes--we'll save you from yourself.  You're like your\nmother.  You'd disgrace us--as she did.\"\n\n\"Don't you dare talk that way, Ruth Warham.  It's false--_false_!\nMy mother is dead--and you're a wicked girl.\"\n\n\"It's time you knew the truth,\" said Ruth softly.  Her eyes were\nhalf shut now and sparkling devilishly.  \"You haven't got any\nname.  You haven't got any father.  And no man of any position\nwould marry you.  As for Sam----\"  She laughed contemptuously.\n\"Do you suppose Sam Wright would marry a girl without a name?\"\n\nSusan had shrunk against the door jamb.  She understood only\ndimly, but things understood dimly are worse than things that are\nclear.  \"Me?\" she muttered.  \"Me?  Oh, Ruth, you don't mean that.\"\n\n\"It's true,\" said Ruth, calmly.  \"And the sooner you realize it\nthe less likely you are to go the way your mother did.\"\n\nSusan stood as if petrified.\n\n\"If Sam Wright comes hanging round you any more, you'll know how\nto treat him,\" Ruth went on.  \"You'll appreciate that he hasn't\nany respect for you--that he thinks you're someone to be trifled\nwith.  And if he talked engagement, it was only a pretense.  Do\nyou understand?\"\n\nThe girl leaning in the doorway gazed into vacancy.  After a\nwhile she answered dully, \"I guess so.\"\n\nRuth began to fuss with the things on her bureau.  Susan went\ninto her room, sat on the edge of the bed.  A few minutes, and\nRuth, somewhat cooled down and not a little frightened, entered.\nShe looked uneasily at the motionless figure.  Finally she said,\n\n\"Susie!\"\n\nNo answer.\n\nMore sharply, \"Susie!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan, without moving.\n\n\"You understand that I told you for your own good?  And you'll\nnot say anything to mother or father?  They feel terribly about it,\nand don't want it ever mentioned.  You won't let on that you know?\"\n\n\"I'll not tell,\" said Susan.\n\n\"You know we're fond of you--and want to do everything for you?\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"It wasn't true--what you said about Sam's making love to you?\"\n\n\"That's all over.  I don't want to talk about it.\"\n\n\"You're not angry with me, Susie?  I admit I was angry, but it\nwas best for you to know--wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan.\n\n\"You're not angry with me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nRuth, still more uneasy, turned back into her own room because\nthere was nothing else to do.  She did not shut the door between.\nWhen she was in her nightgown she glanced in at her cousin.  The\ngirl was sitting on the edge of the bed in the same position.\n\"It's after midnight,\" said Ruth.  \"You'd better get undressed.\"\n\nSusan moved a little.  \"I will,\" she said.\n\nRuth went to bed and soon fell asleep.  After an hour or so she\nawakened.  Light was streaming through the open connecting door.\nShe ran to it, looked in.  Susan's clothes were in a heap beside\nthe bed.  Susan herself, with the pillows propping her, was\nstaring wide-eyed at the ceiling.  It was impossible for Ruth to\nrealize any part of the effect upon her cousin of a thing she\nherself had known for years and had taken always as a matter of\ncourse; she simply felt mildly sorry for unfortunate Susan.\n\n\"Susie, dear,\" she said gently, \"do you want me to turn out the light?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan.\n\nRuth switched off the light and went back to bed, better\ncontent.  She felt that now Susan would stop her staring and\nwould go to sleep.  Sam's call had been very satisfactory.  Ruth\nfelt she had shown off to the best advantage, felt that he\nadmired her, would come to see _her_ next time.  And now that she\nhad so arranged it that Susan would avoid him, everything would\nturn out as she wished.  \"I'll use Arthur to make him jealous\nafter a while--and then--I'll have things my own way.\" As she fell\nasleep she was selecting the rooms Sam and she would occupy in\nthe big Wright mansion--\"when we're not in the East or in Europe.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nRUTH had forgotten to close her shutters, so toward seven\no'clock the light which had been beating against her eyelids for\nthree hours succeeded in lifting them.  She stretched herself and\nyawned noisily.  Susan appeared in the connecting doorway.\n\n\"Are you awake?\" she said softly.\n\n\"What time is it?\" asked Ruth, too lazy to turn over and look at\nher clock.\n\n\"Ten to seven.\"\n\n\"Do close my shutters for me.  I'll sleep an hour or two.\" She\nhazily made out the figure in the doorway.  \"You're dressed,\naren't you?\" she inquired sleepily.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Susan.  \"I've been waiting for you to wake.\"\n\nSomething in the tone made Ruth forget about sleep and rub her\nfingers over her eyes to clear them for a view of her cousin.\nSusan seemed about as usual--perhaps a little serious, but then\nshe had the habit of strange moods of seriousness.  \"What did you\nwant?\" said Ruth.\n\nSusan came into the room, sat at the foot of the bed--there was\nroom, as the bed was long and Ruth short.  \"I want you to tell me\nwhat my mother did.\"\n\n\"Did?\" echoed Ruth feebly.\n\n\"Did, to disgrace you and--me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I couldn't explain--not in a few words.  I'm so sleepy.\nDon't bother about it, Susan.\" And she thrust her head deeper\ninto the pillow.  \"Close the shutters.\"\n\n\"Then I'll have to ask Aunt Fanny--or Uncle George or\neverybody--till I find out.\"\n\n\"But you mustn't do that,\" protested Ruth, flinging herself from\nleft to right impatiently.  \"What is it you want to know?\"\n\n\"About my mother--and what she did.  And why I have no\nfather--why I'm not like you--and the other girls.\"\n\n\"Oh--it's nothing.  I can't explain.  Don't bother about it.  It's\nno use.  It can't be helped.  And it doesn't really matter.\"\n\n\"I've been thinking,\" said Susan.  \"I understand a great many\nthings I didn't know I'd noticed--ever since I was a baby.  But\nwhat I don't understand----\"  She drew a long breath, a cautious\nbreath, as if there were danger of awakening a pain.  \"What I don't\nunderstand is--why.  And--you must tell me all about it. . . .  Was\nmy mother bad?\"\n\n\"Not exactly bad,\" Ruth answered uncertainly.  \"But she did one\nthing that was wicked--at least that a woman never can be\nforgiven for, if it's found out.\"\n\n\"Did she--did she take something that didn't belong to her?\"\n\n\"No--nothing like that.  No, she was, they say, as nice and sweet\nas she could be--except---- She wasn't married to your father.\"\n\nSusan sat in a brown study.  \"I can't understand,\" she said at\nlast.  \"Why--she _must_ have been married, or--or--there wouldn't\nhave been me.\"\n\nRuth smiled uneasily.  \"Not at all.  Don't you really understand?\"\n\nSusan shook her head.\n\n\"He--he betrayed her--and left her--and then everybody knew\nbecause you came.\"\n\nSusan's violet-gray eyes rested a grave, inquiring glance upon\nher cousin's face.  \"But if he betrayed her----  What does 'betray'\nmean?  Doesn't it mean he promised to marry her and didn't?\"\n\n\"Something like that,\" said Ruth.  \"Yes--something like that.\"\n\n\"Then _he_ was the disgrace,\" said the dark cousin, after reflecting.\n\"No--you're not telling me, Ruth.  _What_ did my mother do?\"\n\n\"She had you without being married.\"\n\nAgain Susan sat in silence, trying to puzzle it out.  Ruth lifted\nherself, put the pillows behind her back.  \"You don't\nunderstand--anything--do you?  Well, I'll try to explain--though\nI don't know much about it.\"\n\nAnd hesitatingly, choosing words she thought fitted to those\ninnocent ears, hunting about for expressions she thought\ncomprehensible to that innocent mind, Ruth explained the\nrelations of the sexes--an inaccurate, often absurd,\nexplanation, for she herself knew only what she had picked up\nfrom other girls--the fantastic hodgepodge of pruriency,\nphysiology and sheer nonsense which under our system of\neducation distorts and either alarms or inflames the imaginations\nof girls and boys where the clean, simple truth would at least\nenlighten them.  Susan listened with increasing amazement.\n\n\"Well, do you understand?\" Ruth ended.  \"How we come into the\nworld--and what marriage means?\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" declared Susan.  \"It's--awful!\" And she\nshivered with disgust.\n\n\"I tell you it's true,\" insisted Ruth.  \"I thought it was awful\nwhen I first heard--when Lottie Wright took me out in their\norchard, where nobody could listen, and told me what their cook\nhad told her.  But I've got kind of used to it.\"\n\n\"But it--it's so, then; my mother did marry my father,\" said Susan.\n\n\"No.  She let him betray her.  And when a woman lets a man betray\nher without being married by the preacher or somebody, why,\nshe's ruined forever.\"\n\n\"But doesn't marriage mean where two people promise to love each\nother and then betray each other?\"\n\n\"If they're married, it isn't betraying,\" explained Ruth.  \"If\nthey're not, it is betraying.\" Susan reflected, nodded slowly.\n\"I guess I understand.  But don't you see it was my father who was\nthe disgrace?  He was the one that promised to marry and didn't.\"\n\n\"How foolish you are!\" cried Ruth.  \"I never knew you to be stupid.\"\n\n\"But isn't it so?\" persisted Susan.\n\n\"Yes--in a way,\" her cousin admitted.  \"Only--the woman must keep\nherself pure until the ceremony has been performed.\"\n\n\"But if he said so to her, wasn't that saying so to God just as\nmuch as if the preacher had been there?\"\n\n\"No, it wasn't,\" said Ruth with irritation.  \"And it's wicked to\nthink such things.  All I know is, God says a woman must be\nmarried before she--before she has any children.  And your mother\nwasn't.\" Susan shook her head.  \"I guess you don't understand any\nbetter than I do--really.\"\n\n\"No, I don't,\" confessed Ruth.  \"But I'd like to see any man more\nthan kiss me or put his arm round me without our having been married.\"\n\n\"But,\" urged Susan, \"if he kissed you, wouldn't that be like marriage?\"\n\n\"Some say so,\" admitted Ruth.  \"But I'm not so strict.  A little\nkissing and that often leads a man to propose.\" Susan reflected\nagain.  \"It all sounds low and sneaking to me,\" was her final\nverdict.  \"I don't want to have anything to do with it.  But I'm\nsure my mother was a good woman.  It wasn't her fault if she was\nlied to, when she loved and believed.  And anybody who blames her\nis low and bad.  I'm glad I haven't got any father, if fathers\nhave to be made to promise before everybody or else they'll not\nkeep their word.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll not argue about it,\" said Ruth.  \"I'm telling you the\nway things are.  The woman has to take _all_ the blame.\" Susan\nlifted her head haughtily.  \"I'd be glad to be blamed by anybody\nwho was wicked enough to be that unjust.  I'd not have anything\nto do with such people.\"\n\n\"Then you'd live alone.\"\n\n\"No, I shouldn't.  There are lots of people who are good and----\"\n\n\"That's wicked, Susan,\" interrupted Ruth.  \"All good people think\nas I tell you they do.\"\n\n\"Do Aunt Fanny and Uncle George blame my mother?\"\n\n\"Of course.  How could they help it, when she----\"  Ruth was checked\nby the gathering lightnings in those violet-gray eyes.\n\n\"But,\" pursued Susan, after a pause, \"even if they were wicked\nenough to blame my mother, they couldn't blame me.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" declared Ruth warmly.  \"Hasn't everybody always\nbeen sweet and kind to you?\"\n\n\"But last night you said----\"\n\nRuth hid her face.  \"I'm ashamed of what I said last night,\" she\nmurmured.  \"I've got, Oh, such a _nasty_ disposition, Susie.\"\n\n\"But what you said--wasn't it so?\" Ruth turned away her head.\n\nSusan drew a long sigh, so quietly that Ruth could not have heard.\n\n\"You understand,\" Ruth said gently, \"everybody feels sorry for\nyou and----\"\n\nSusan frowned stormily, \"They'd better feel sorry for themselves.\"\n\n\"Oh, Susie, dear,\" cried Ruth, impulsively catching her hand,\n\"we all love you, and mother and father and I--we'll stand up\nfor you through everything----\"\n\n\"Don't you _dare_ feel sorry for me!\" Susan cried, wrenching her\nhand away.\n\nRuth's eyes filled with tears.\n\n\"You can't blame us because everybody---- You know, God says,\n'The sins of the fathers shall be visited on the children----'\"\n\n\"I'm done with everybody,\" cried Susan, rising and lifting her\nproud head, \"I'm done with God.\"\n\nRuth gave a low scream and shuddered.  Susan looked round\ndefiantly, as if she expected a bolt from the blue to come\nhurtling through the open window.  But the sky remained serene,\nand the quiet, scented breeze continued to play with the lace\ncurtains, and the birds on the balcony did not suspend their\nchattering courtship.  This lack of immediate effect from her\ndeclaration of war upon man and God was encouraging.  The last of\nthe crushed, cowed feeling Ruth had inspired the night before\ndisappeared.  With a soul haughtily plumed and looking defiance\nfrom the violet-gray eyes, Susan left her cousin and betook\nherself down to breakfast.\n\nIn common with most children, she had always dreamed of a\nmysterious fate for herself, different from the commonplace\nroutine around her.  Ruth's revelations, far from daunting her,\nfar from making her feel like cringing before the world in\ngratitude for its tolerance of her bar sinister, seemed a\nfascinatingly tragic confirmation of her romantic longings and\nbeliefs.  No doubt it was the difference from the common lot that\nhad attracted Sam to her; and this difference would make their\nlove wholly unlike the commonplace Sutherland wooing and\nwedding.  Yes, hers had been a mysterious fate, and would\ncontinue to be.  Nora, an old woman now, had often related in her\npresence how Doctor Stevens had brought her to life when she lay\napparently, indeed really, dead upon the upstairs sitting-room\ntable--Doctor Stevens and Nora's own prayers.  An extraordinary\nbirth, in defiance of the laws of God and man; an extraordinary\nresurrection, in defiance of the laws of nature--yes, hers would\nbe a life superbly different from the common.  And when she and\nSam married, how gracious and forgiving she would be to all\nthose bad-hearted people; how she would shame them for their\nevil thoughts against her mother and herself!\n\nThe Susan Lenox who sat alone at the little table in the\ndining-room window, eating bread and butter and honey in the\ncomb, was apparently the same Susan Lenox who had taken three\nmeals a day in that room all those years--was, indeed, actually\nthe same, for character is not an overnight creation.  Yet it was\nan amazingly different Susan Lenox, too.  The first crisis had\ncome; she had been put to the test; and she had not collapsed in\nweakness but had stood erect in strength.\n\nAfter breakfast she went down Main Street and at Crooked Creek\nAvenue took the turning for the cemetery.  She sought the Warham\nplot, on the western slope near the quiet brook.  There was a\nclump of cedars at each corner of the plot; near the largest of\nthem were three little graves--the three dead children of George\nand Fanny.  In the shadow of the clump and nearest the brook was\na fourth grave apart and, to the girl, now thrillingly mysterious:\n\n\n                       LORELLA LENOX\n                       BORN MAY 9, 1859\n                       DIED JULY 17, 1879\n\n\nTwenty years old!  Susan's tears scalded her eyes.  Only a little\nolder than her cousin Ruth was now--Ruth who often seemed to her,\nand to everybody, younger than herself.  \"And she was good--I\nknow she was good!\" thought Susan.  \"_He_ was bad, and the people\nwho took his part against her were bad.  But _she_ was good!\"\n\nShe started as Sam's voice, gay and light, sounded directly\nbehind her.  \"What are you doing in a graveyard?\" cried he.\n\n\"How did you find me?\" she asked, paling and flushing and paling again.\n\n\"I've been following you ever since you left home.\"\n\nHe might have added that he did not try to overtake her until\nthey were where people would be least likely to see.\n\n\"Whose graves are those?\" he went on, cutting across a plot and\nstepping on several graves to join her.\n\nShe was gazing at her mothers simple headstone.  His glance\nfollowed hers, he read.\n\n\"Oh--beg pardon,\" he said confusedly.  \"I didn't see.\"\n\nShe turned her serious gaze from the headstone to his face,\nwhich her young imagination transfigured.  \"You know--about her?\"\nshe asked.\n\n\"I--I--I've heard,\" he confessed.  \"But--Susie, it doesn't amount\nto anything.  It happened a long time ago--and everybody's\nforgotten--and----\"  His stammering falsehoods died away before\nher steady look.  \"How did you find out?\"\n\n\"Someone just told me,\" replied she.  \"And they said you'd never\nrespect or marry a girl who had no father.  No--don't\ndeny--please!  I didn't believe it--not after what we had said\nto each other.\"\n\nSam, red and shifting uneasily, could not even keep his downcast\neyes upon the same spot of ground.\n\n\"You see,\" she went on, sweet and grave, \"they don't understand\nwhat love means--do they?\"\n\n\"I guess not,\" muttered he, completely unnerved.\n\nWhy, how seriously the girl had taken him and his words--such a\nfew words and not at all definite!  No, he decided, it was the\nkiss.  He had heard of girls so innocent that they thought a kiss\nmeant the same as being married.  He got himself together as well\nas he could and looked at her.\n\n\"But, Susie,\" he said, \"you're too young for anything\ndefinite--and I'm not halfway through college.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said she.  \"But you need not be afraid I'll change.\"\n\nShe was so sweet, so magnetic, so compelling that in spite of\nthe frowns of prudence he seized her hand.  At her touch he flung\nprudence to the winds.  \"I love you,\" he cried; and putting his\narm around her, he tried to kiss her.  She gently but strongly\nrepulsed him.  \"Why not, dear?\" he pleaded.  \"You love me--don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, her honest eyes shining upon his.  \"But we\nmust wait until we're married.  I don't care so much for the\nothers, but I'd not want Uncle George to feel I had disgraced him.\"\n\n\"Why, there's no harm in a kiss,\" pleaded he.\n\n\"Kissing you is--different,\" she replied.  \"It's--it's--marriage.\"\n\nHe understood her innocence that frankly assumed marriage where\na sophisticated girl would, in the guilt of designing thoughts,\nhave shrunk in shame from however vaguely suggesting such a\nthing.  He realized to the full his peril.  \"I'm a damn fool,\" he\nsaid to himself, \"to hang about her.  But somehow I can't help\nit--I can't!\" And the truth was, he loved her as much as a boy\nof his age is capable of loving, and he would have gone on and\nmarried her but for the snobbishness smeared on him by the\nprovincialism of the small town and burned in by the toadyism of\nhis fashionable college set.  As he looked at her he saw beauty\nbeyond any he had ever seen elsewhere and a sweetness and\nhonesty that made him ashamed before her.  \"No, I couldn't harm\nher,\" he told himself.  \"I'm not such a dog as that.  But there's\nno harm in loving her and kissing her and making her as happy as\nit's right to be.\"\n\n\"Don't be mean, Susan,\" he begged, tears in his eyes.  \"If you\nlove me, you'll let me kiss you.\"\n\nAnd she yielded, and the shock of the kiss set both to\ntrembling.  It appealed to his vanity, it heightened his own\nagitations to see how pale she had grown and how her rounded\nbosom rose and fell in the wild tumult of her emotions.  \"Oh, I\ncan't do without seeing you,\" she cried.  \"And Aunt Fanny has\nforbidden me.\"\n\n\"I thought so!\" exclaimed he.  \"I did what I could last night to\nthrow them off the track.  If Ruth had only known what I was\nthinking about all the time.  Where were you?\"\n\n\"Upstairs--on the balcony.\"\n\n\"I felt it,\" he declared.  \"And when she sang love songs I could\nhardly keep from rushing up to you.  Susie, we _must_ see each other.\"\n\n\"I can come here, almost any day.\"\n\n\"But people'd soon find out--and they'd say all sorts of things.\nAnd your uncle and aunt would hear.\"\n\nThere was no disputing anything so obvious.\n\n\"Couldn't you come down tonight, after the others are in bed and\nthe house is quiet?\" he suggested.\n\nShe hesitated before the deception, though she felt that her family\nhad forfeited the right to control her.  But love, being the supreme\nnecessity, conquered.  \"For a few minutes,\" she conceded.\n\nShe had been absorbed; but his eyes, kept alert by his\nconventional soul, had seen several people at a distance\nobserving without seeming to do so.  \"We must separate,\" he now\nsaid.  \"You see, Susie, we mustn't be gossiped about.  You know\nhow determined they are to keep us apart.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes,\" she eagerly agreed.  \"Will you go first, or shall I?\"\n\n\"You go--the way you came.  I'll jump the brook down where it's\nnarrow and cut across and into our place by the back way.  What\ntime tonight?\"\n\n\"Arthur's coming,\" reflected Susie aloud.  \"Ruth'll not let him\nstay late.  She'll be sleepy and will go straight to bed.  About\nhalf past ten.  If I'm not on the front veranda--no, the side\nveranda--by eleven, you'll know something has prevented.\"\n\n\"But you'll surely come?\"\n\n\"I'll come.\" And it both thrilled and alarmed him to see how\nmuch in earnest she was.  But he looked love into her loving eyes\nand went away, too intoxicated to care whither this adventure\nwas leading him.\n\nAt dinner she felt she was no longer a part of this family.  Were\nthey not all pitying and looking down on her in their hearts?\nShe was like a deformed person who has always imagined the\nconsideration he has had was natural and equal, and suddenly\ndiscovers that it is pity for his deformity.  She now acutely\nfelt her aunt's, her cousin's, dislike; and her uncle's\ngentleness was not less galling.  In her softly rounded youthful\nface there was revealed definitely for the first time an\nunderlying expression of strength, of what is often confused\nwith its feeble counterfeit, obstinacy--that power to resist\ncircumstances which makes the unusual and the firm character.\nThe young mobility of her features suggested the easy swaying of\nthe baby sapling in the gentlest breeze.  Singularly at variance\nwith it was this expression of tenacity.  Such an expression in\nthe face of the young infallibly forecasts an agitated and\nagitating life.  It seemed amazingly out of place in Susan\nbecause theretofore she had never been put to the test in any\nbut unnoted trifles and so had given the impression that she was\nas docile as she was fearful of giving annoyance or pain and\nindifferent to having her own way.  Those who have this\ntemperament of strength encased in gentleness are invariably\nmisunderstood.  When they assert themselves, though they are in\nthe particular instance wholly right, they are regarded as\nwholly and outrageously wrong.  Life deals hardly with them,\npunishes them for the mistaken notion of themselves they have\nthrough forbearance and gentleness of heart permitted an\nunobservant world to form.\n\nSusan spent the afternoon on the balcony before her window,\nreading and sewing--or, rather, dreaming over first a book, then\na dress.  When she entered the dining-room at supper time the\nothers were already seated.  She saw instantly that something had\noccurred--something ominous for her.  Mrs. Warham gave her a\npenetrating, severe look and lowered her eyes; Ruth was gazing\nsullenly at her plate.  Warham's glance was stern and\nreproachful.  She took her place opposite Ruth, and the meal was\neaten in silence.  Ruth left the table first.  Next Mrs. Warham\nrose and saying, \"Susan, when you've finished, I wish to see you\nin the sitting-room upstairs,\" swept in solemn dignity from the\nroom.  Susan rose at once to follow.  As she was passing her uncle\nhe put out his hand and detained her.\n\n\"I hope it was only a foolish girl's piece of nonsense,\" said he\nwith an attempt at his wonted kindliness.  \"And I know it won't\noccur again.  But when your aunt says things you won't like to\nhear, remember that you brought this on yourself and that she\nloves you as we all do and is thinking only of your good.\"\n\n\"What is it, Uncle George?\" cried Susan, amazed.  \"What have I done?\"\n\nWarham looked sternly grieved.  \"Brownie,\" he reproached, \"you\nmustn't deceive.  Go to your aunt.\"\n\nShe found her aunt seated stiffly in the living-room, her hands\nfolded upon her stomach.  So gradual had been the crucial\nmiddle-life change in Fanny that no one had noted it.  This\nevening Susan, become morbidly acute, suddenly realized the\ncontrast between the severe, uncertain-tempered aunt of today\nand the amiable, altogether and always gentle aunt of two years\nbefore.\n\n\"What is it, aunt?\" she said, feeling as if she were before a\nstranger and an enemy.\n\n\"The whole town is talking about your disgraceful doings this\nmorning,\" Ruth's mother replied in a hard voice.\n\nThe color leaped in Susan's cheeks.\n\n\"Yesterday I forbade you to see Sam Wright again.  And already\nyou disobey.\"\n\n\"I did not say I would not see him again,\" replied Susan.\n\n\"I thought you were an honest, obedient girl,\" cried Fanny, the\nhigh shrill notes in her voice rasping upon the sensitive, the\nnow morbidly sensitive, Susan.  \"Instead--you slip away from the\nhouse and meet a young man--and permit him to take _liberties_\nwith you.\"\n\nSusan braced herself.  \"I did not go to the cemetery to meet\nhim,\" she replied; and that new or, rather, newly revived\ntenacity was strong in her eyes, in the set of her sweet mouth.\n\"He saw me on the way and followed.  I did let him kiss me--once.\nBut I had the right to.\"\n\n\"You have disgraced yourself--and us all.\"\n\n\"We are going to be married.\"\n\n\"I don't want to hear such foolish talk!\" cried Mrs. Warham\nviolently.  \"If you had any sense, you'd know better.\"\n\n\"He and I do not feel as you do about my mother,\" said the girl\nwith quiet dignity.\n\nMrs. Warham shivered before this fling.  \"Who told you?\" she demanded.\n\n\"It doesn't matter; I know.\"\n\n\"Well, miss, since you know, then I can tell you that your uncle\nand I realize you're going the way your mother went.  And the\nwhole town thinks you've gone already.  They're all saying, 'I\ntold you so!  I told you so!  Like her mother!'\" Mrs. Warham was\nweeping hysterical tears of fury.  \"The whole town!  And it'll\nreflect on my Ruth.  Oh, you miserable girl!  Whatever possessed\nme to take pity on you!\"\n\nSusan's hands clutched until the nails sunk into the palms.  She\nshut her teeth together, turned to fly.\n\n\"Wait!\" commanded Mrs. Warham.  \"Wait, I tell you!\"\n\nSusan halted in the doorway, but did not turn.\n\n\"Your uncle and I have talked it over.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Susan.\n\nMrs. Warham's eyes glistened.  \"Yes, he has wakened up at last.\nThere's one thing he isn't soft about----\"\n\n\"You've turned him against me!\" cried the girl despairingly.\n\n\"You mean _you_ have turned him against you,\" retorted her aunt.\n\"Anyhow, you can't wheedle him this time.  He's as bent as I am.\nAnd you must promise us that you won't see Sam again.\"\n\nA pause.  Then Susan said, \"I can't.\"\n\n\"Then we'll send you away to your Uncle Zeke's.  It's quiet out\nthere and you'll have a chance to think things over.  And I\nreckon he'll watch you.  He's never forgiven your mother.  Now,\nwill you promise?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan calmly.  \"You have wicked thoughts about my\nmother, and you are being wicked to me--you and Ruth.  Oh, I\nunderstand!\"\n\n\"Don't you dare stand there and lie that way!\" raved Mrs.\nWarham.  \"I'll give you tonight to think about it.  If you don't\npromise, you leave this house.  Your uncle has been weak where\nyou were concerned, but this caper of yours has brought him to\nhis senses.  We'll not have you a loose character--and your\ncousin's life spoiled by it.  First thing we know, no respectable\nman'll marry her, either.\"\n\nFrom between the girl's shut teeth issued a cry.  She darted\nacross the hall, locked herself in her room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nSAM did not wait until Arthur Sinclair left, but, all ardor and\nimpatience, stole in at the Warhams' front gate at ten o'clock.\nHe dropped to the grass behind a clump of lilacs, and to calm\nhis nerves and to make the time pass more quickly, smoked a\ncigarette, keeping its lighted end carefully hidden in the\nhollow of his hand.  He was not twenty feet away, was seeing and\nhearing, when Arthur kissed Ruth good night.  He laughed to\nhimself.  \"How disappointed she looked last night when she saw I\nwasn't going to do that!\" What a charmer Susie must be when the\nthought of her made the idea of kissing as pretty a girl as Ruth\nuninteresting, almost distasteful!\n\nSinclair departed; the lights in parlor and hall went out;\npresently light appeared through the chinks in some of the\nsecond-story shutters.  Then followed three-quarters of an hour\nof increasing tension.  The tension would have been even greater\nhad he seen the young lady going leisurely about her\npreparations for bed.  For Ruth was of the orderly, precise women\nwho are created to foster the virtue of patience in those about\nthem.  It took her nearly as long to dress for bed as for a\nparty.  She did her hair up in curl papers with the utmost care;\nshe washed and rinsed and greased her face and neck and gave\nthem a thorough massage.  She shook out and carefully hung or\nfolded or put to air each separate garment.  She examined her\nsilk stockings for holes, found one, darned it with a neatness\nrivaling that of a _stoppeur_.  She removed from her dressing\ntable and put away in drawers everything that was out of place.\nShe closed each drawer tightly, closed and locked the closets,\nlooked under the bed, turned off the lights over the dressing\ntable.  She completed her toilet with a slow washing of her\nteeth, a long spraying of her throat, and a deliberate,\nthoroughgoing dripping of boracic acid into each eye to keep and\nimprove its clearness and brilliancy.  She sat on the bed,\nreflected on what she had done, to assure herself that nothing\nhad been omitted.  After a slow look around she drew off her\nbedroom slippers, set them carefully side by side near the head\nof the bed.  She folded her nightgown neatly about her legs,\nthrust them down into the bed.  Again she looked slowly,\nsearchingly, about the room to make absolutely sure she had\nforgotten nothing, had put everything in perfect order.  Once in\nbed, she hated to get out; yet if she should recall any\nomission, however slight, she would be unable to sleep until she\nhad corrected it.  Finally, sure as fallible humanity can be, she\nturned out the last light, lay down--went instantly to sleep.\n\nIt was hardly a quarter of an hour after the vanishing of that\nlast ray when Sam, standing now with heart beating fast and a\nlump of expectancy, perhaps of trepidation, too, in his throat,\nsaw a figure issue from the front door and move round to the\nside veranda.  He made a detour on the lawn, so as to keep out of\nview both from house and street, came up to the veranda, called\nto her softly.\n\n\"Can you get over the rail?\" asked she in the same low tone.\n\n\"Let's go back to the summer house,\" urged he.\n\n\"No.  Come up here,\" she insisted.  \"Be careful.  The windows above\nare open.\"\n\nHe climbed the rail noiselessly and made an impetuous move for\nher hand.  She drew back.  \"No, Sam dear,\" she said.  \"I know it's\nfoolish.  But I've an instinct against it--and we mustn't.\"\n\nShe spoke so gently that he persisted and pleaded.  It was some\ntime before he realized how much firmness there was under her\ngentleness.  She was so afraid of making him cross; yet he also\nsaw that she would withstand at any cost.  He placed himself\nbeside her on the wicker lounge, sitting close, his cheek almost\nagainst hers, that they might hear each other without speaking\nabove a whisper.  After one of those silences which are the\npeculiar delight of lovers, she drew a long breath and said:\n\"I've got to go away, Sam.  I shan't see you again for a long time.\"\n\n\"They heard about this morning?  They're sending you away?\"\n\n\"No--I'm going.  They feel that I'm a disgrace and a drag.  So I\ncan't stay.\"\n\n\"But--you've _got_ to stay!\" protested Sam.  In wild alarm he\nsuspected she was preparing to make him elope with her--and he\ndid not know to what length of folly his infatuation might whirl\nhim.  \"You've no place to go,\" he urged.\n\n\"I'll find a place,\" said she.\n\n\"You mustn't--you mustn't, Susie!  Why, you're only\nseventeen--and have no experience.\"\n\n\"I'll _get_ experience,\" said she.  \"Nothing could be so bad as\nstaying here.  Can't you see that?\"\n\nHe could not.  Like so many of the children of the rich, he had\nno trace of over-nice sense of self-respect, having been lying\nand toadying all his life to a father who used the power of his\nwealth at home no less, rather more, than abroad.  But he vaguely\nrealized what delicacy of feeling lay behind her statement of\nher position; and he did not dare express his real opinion.  He\nreturned to the main point.  \"You've simply got to put up with it\nfor the present, Susie,\" he insisted.  \"But, then, of course,\nyou're not serious.\"\n\n\"Yes.  I am going.\"\n\n\"You'll think it over, and see I'm right, dear.\"\n\n\"I'm going tonight.\"\n\n\"Tonight!\" he cried.\n\n\"Sh-h!\"\n\nSam looked apprehensively around.  Both breathed softly and\nlistened with straining ears.  His exclamation had not been loud,\nbut the silence was profound.  \"I guess nobody heard,\" he finally\nwhispered.  \"You mustn't go, Susie.\" He caught her hand and held\nit.  \"I love you, and I forbid it.\"\n\n\"I _must_ go, dear,\" answered she.  \"I've decided to take the\nmidnight boat for Cincinnati.\"\n\nIn the half darkness he gazed in stupefaction at her--this girl\nof only seventeen calmly resolving upon and planning an\nadventure so daring, so impossible.  As he had been born and bred\nin that western country where the very children have more\nindependence than the carefully tamed grown people of the East,\nhe ought to have been prepared for almost anything.  But his\nfather had undermined his courage and independence; also his\nyear in the East had given him somewhat different ideas of\nwomen.  Susan's announcement seemed incredible.  He was gathering\nhimself for pouring out a fresh protest when it flashed through\nhis mind--Why not?  She would go to Cincinnati.  He could follow\nin a few days or a week--and then--\n\nWell, at least they would be free and could have many happy days\ntogether.\n\n\"Why, how could you get to Cincinnati?\" he said.  \"You haven't\nany money.\"\n\n\"I've a twenty-dollar gold piece Uncle gave me as a keepsake.\nAnd I've got seventeen dollars in other money, and several\ndollars in change,\" explained she.  \"I've got two hundred and\nforty-three dollars and fifty cents in the bank, but I can't get\nthat--not now.  They'll send it to me when I find a place and am\nsettled and let them know.\"\n\n\"You can't do it, Susie!  You can't and you mustn't.\"\n\n\"If you knew what they said to me!  Oh, I _couldn't_ stay, Sam.\nI've got some of my clothes--a little bundle behind the front\ndoor.  As soon as I'm settled I'll let you know.\"\n\nA silence, then he, hesitatingly, \"Don't you--do you--hadn't I\nbetter go with you?\"\n\nShe thrilled at this generosity, this new proof of love.  But she\nsaid:  \"No, I wouldn't let you do that.  They'd blame you.  And I\nwant them to know it's all my own doing.\"\n\n\"You're right, Susie,\" said the young man, relieved and\nemphatic.  \"If I went with you, it'd only get both of us into\ndeeper trouble.\" Again silence, with Sam feeling a kind of awe\nas he studied the resolute, mysterious profile of the girl,\nwhich he could now see clearly.  At last he said:  \"And after you\nget there, Susie--what will you do?\"\n\n\"Find a boarding house, and then look for a place.\"\n\n\"What kind of a place?\"\n\n\"In a store--or making dresses--or any kind of sewing.  Or I\ncould do housework.\"\n\nThe sex impulse is prolific of generous impulses.  He, sitting so\nclose to her and breathing in through his skin the emanations of\nher young magnetism, was moved to the depths by the picture her\nwords conjured.  This beautiful girl, a mere child, born and bred\nin the lady class, wandering away penniless and alone, to be a\nprey to the world's buffetings which, severe enough in reality,\nseem savage beyond endurance to the children of wealth.\n\nAs he pictured it his heart impulsively expanded.  It was at his\nlips to offer to marry her.  But his real self--and one's real\nself is vastly different from one's impulses--his real self\nforbade the words passage.  Not even the sex impulse,\nintoxicating him as it then was, could dethrone snobbish\ncalculation.  He was young; so while he did not speak, he felt\nashamed of himself for not speaking.  He felt that she must be\nexpecting him to speak, that she had the right to expect it.  He\ndrew a little away from her, and kept silent.\n\n\"The time will soon pass,\" said she absently.\n\n\"The time?  Then you intend to come back?\"\n\n\"I mean the time until you're through college and we can be together.\"\n\nShe spoke as one speaks of a dream as to which one has never a\ndoubt but that it will come true.  It was so preposterous, this\nidea that he would marry her, especially after she had been a\nservant or God knows what for several years--it was so absurd\nthat he burst into a sweat of nervous terror.  And he hastily\ndrew further away.\n\nShe felt the change, for she was of those who are born\nsensitive.  But she was far too young and inexperienced to have\nlearned to interpret aright the subtle warning of the nerves.\n\"You are displeased with me?\" she asked timidly.\n\n\"No--Oh, no, Susie,\" he stammered.  \"I--I was thinking.  Do put\noff going for a day or two.  There's no need of hurrying.\"\n\nBut she felt that by disobeying her aunt and coming down to see\nhim she had forfeited the right to shelter under that roof.  \"I\ncan't go back,\" said she.  \"There's a reason.\" She would not tell\nhim the reason; it would make him feel as if he were to blame.\n\"When I get a place in Cincinnati,\" she went on, \"I'll write to you.\"\n\n\"Not here,\" he objected.  \"That wouldn't do at all.  No, send me a\nline to the Gibson House in Cincinnati, giving me your address.\"\n\n\"The Gibson House,\" she repeated.  \"I'll not forget that name.\nGibson House.\"\n\n\"Send it as soon as you get a place.  I may be in Cincinnati\nsoon.  But this is all nonsense.  You're not going.  You'd be afraid.\"\n\nShe laughed softly.  \"You don't know me.  Now that I've got to go,\nI'm glad.\"\n\nAnd he realized that she was not talking to give herself\ncourage, that her words were literally true.  This made him\nadmire her, and fear her, too.  There must be something wild and\nunwomanly in her nature.  \"I guess she inherits it from her\nmother--and perhaps her father, whoever he was.\" Probably she\nwas simply doing a little early what she'd have been sure to do\nsooner or later, no matter what had happened.  On the whole, it\nwas just as well that she was going.  \"I can take her on East in\nthe fall.  As soon as she has a little knowledge of the world\nshe'll not expect me to marry her.  She can get something to do.\nI'll help her.\" And now he felt in conceit with himself\nagain--felt that he was going to be a good, generous friend to her.\n\n\"Perhaps you'll be better off--once you get started,\" said he.\n\n\"I don't see how I could be worse off.  What is there here for _me_?\"\n\nHe wondered at the good sense of this from a mere child.  It was\nmost unlikely that any man of the class she had been brought up\nin would marry her; and how could she endure marriage with a man\nof the class in which she might possibly find a husband?  As for\nreputation--\n\nShe, an illegitimate child, never could have a reputation, at\nleast not so long as she had her looks.  After supper, to kill\ntime, he had dropped in at Willett's drug store, where the young\nfellows loafed and gossiped in the evenings; all the time he was\nthere the conversation had been made up of sly digs and hints\nabout graveyard trysts, each thrust causing the kind of laughter\nthat is the wake of the prurient and the obscene.  Yes, she was\nright.  There could be \"nothing in it\" for her in Sutherland.  He\nwas filled with pity for her.  \"Poor child!  What a shame!\" There\nmust be something wrong with a world that permitted such iniquities.\n\nThe clock struck twelve.  \"You must go,\" she said.  \"Sometimes\nthe boat comes as early as half-past.\" And she stood up.\n\nAs he faced her the generous impulse surged again.  He caught her\nin his arms, she not resisting.  He kissed her again and again,\nmurmuring disconnected words of endearment and fighting back the\noffer to marry her.  \"I mustn't!  I mustn't!\" he said to himself.\n\"What'd become of us?\" If his passions had been as virgin, as\ninexperienced, as hers, no power could have held him from going\nwith her and marrying her.  But experience had taught him the\nabysmal difference between before and after; and he found\nstrength to be sensible, even in the height of his passionate\nlonging for her.\n\nShe clasped her arms about his neck.  \"Oh, my dear love!\" she\nmurmured.  \"I'd do anything for you.  I feel that you love me as\nI love you.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes.\" And he pressed his lips to hers.  An instant and she\ndrew away, shaking and panting.  He tried to clasp her again, but\nshe would not have it.  \"I can't stand it!\" he murmured.  \"I must\ngo with you--I must!\"\n\n\"No!\" she replied.  \"It wouldn't do unless we were really\nmarried.\" Wistfully, \"And we can't be that yet--can we?  There\nisn't any way?\"\n\nHis passion cooled instantly.\n\n\"There isn't any way,\" he said regretfully.  \"I'd not dare tell\nmy father.\"\n\n\"Yes, we must wait till you're of age, and have your education,\nand are free.  Then----\"  She drew a long breath, looked at him\nwith a brave smile.  The large moon was shining upon them.  \"We'll\nthink of that, and not let ourselves be unhappy--won't we?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.  \"But I must go.\"\n\n\"I forgot for the minute.  Good-by, dearest.\" She put up her\nlips.  He kissed her, but without passion now.\n\n\"You might go with me as far as the wharf,\" she suggested.\n\n\"No--someone might see--and that would ruin everything.  I'd like\nto--I'd----\"\n\n\"It wouldn't do,\" she interrupted.  \"I wouldn't let you come.\"\n\nWith sudden agitation she kissed him--he felt that her lips were\ncold.  He pressed her hands--they, too, were cold.  \"Good-by, my\ndarling,\" he murmured, vaulted lightly over the rail and\ndisappeared in the deep shadows of the shrubbery.  When he was\nclear of the grounds he paused to light a cigarette.  His hand\nwas shaking so that the match almost dropped from his fingers.\n\"I've been making a damn fool of myself,\" he said half aloud.  \"A\ndouble damn fool!  I've got to stop that talk about marrying,\nsomehow--or keep away from her.  But I can't keep away.  I _must_\nhave her!  Why in the devil can't she realize that a man in my\nposition couldn't marry her?  If it wasn't for this marrying\ntalk, I'd make her happy.  I've simply got to stop this marrying\ntalk.  It gets worse and worse.\"\n\n\nHer calmness deceived her into thinking herself perfectly sane\nand sober, perfectly aware of what she was about.  She had left\nher hat and her bundle behind the door.  She put on the hat in\nthe darkness of the hall with steady fingers, took up the\nwell-filled shawl strap and went forth, closing the door behind\nher.  In the morning they would find the door unlocked but that\nwould not cause much talk, as Sutherland people were all rather\ncareless about locking up.  They would not knock at the door of\nher room until noon, perhaps.  Then they would find on the\npincushion the letter she had written to her uncle, saying\ngood-by and explaining that she had decided to remove forever\nthe taint of her mother and herself from their house and their\nlives--a somewhat theatrical letter, modeled upon Ouida, whom\nshe thought the greatest writer that had ever lived, Victor Hugo\nand two or three poets perhaps excepted.\n\nHer bundle was not light, but she hardly felt it as she moved\nswiftly through the deserted, moonlit streets toward the river.\nThe wharf boat for the Cincinnati and Louisville mail steamers\nwas anchored at the foot of Pine Street.  On the levee before it\nwere piled the boxes, bags, cases, crates, barrels to be loaded\nupon the \"up boat.\" She was descending the gentle slope toward\nthis mass of freight when her blood tingled at a deep, hoarse,\nmournful whistle from far away; she knew it was the up boat,\nrounding the bend and sighting the town.  The sound echoed\nmusically back and forth between the Kentucky and the Indiana\nbluffs, died lingeringly away.  Again the whistle boomed, again\nthe dark forest-clad steeps sent the echoes to and fro across the\nbroad silver river.  And now she could see the steamer, at the\nbend--a dark mass picked out with brilliant dots of light; the\nbig funnels, the two thick pennants of black smoke.  And she\ncould hear the faint pleasant stroke of the paddles of the big\nside wheels upon the water.\n\nAt the wharf boat there had not been a sign of life.  But with\nthe dying away of the second whistle lights--the lights of\nlanterns--appeared on the levee close to the water's edge and on\nthe wharf boat itself.  And, behind her, the doors of the\nSutherland Hotel opened and its office lit up, in preparation\nfor any chance arrivals.  She turned abruptly out of the beaten\npath down the gravel levee, made for the lower and darker end of\nthe wharf boat.  There would be Sutherland people going up the\nriver.  But they would be more than prompt; everyone came early\nto boats and trains to begin the sweet draught of the excitement\nof journeying.  So she would wait in the darkness and go aboard\nwhen the steamer was about to draw in its planks.  At the upper\nend of the wharf boat there was the broad gangway to the levee\nfor passengers and freight; at the lower and dark and deserted\nend a narrow beam extended from boat to shore, to hold the boat\nsteady.  Susan, balancing herself with her bundle, went up to the\nbeam, sat down upon a low stanchion in the darkness where she\ncould see the river.\n\nLouder and louder grew the regular musical beat of engine and\npaddle.  The searchlight on the forward deck of the _General\nLytle_, after peering uncertainly, suspiciously, at the entire\nlevee, and at the river, and at the Kentucky shore, abruptly\nfocused upon the wharf boat.  The _General Lytle_ now seemed a\nblaze of lights--from lower deck, from saloon deck, from pilot\nhouse deck, and forward and astern.  A hundred interesting sounds\ncame from her--tinkling of bells, calls from deck to deck,\nwhistling, creaking of pulleys, lowing of cattle, grunting of\nswine, plaint of agitated sheep, the resigned cluckings of many\nchickens.  Along the rail of the middle or saloon deck were\nseated a few passengers who had not yet gone to bed.  On the\nlower deck was a swarm of black roustabouts, their sooty animal\nfaces, their uncannily contrasting white teeth and eyeballs,\ntheir strange and varied rags lit up by the torches blazing\nwhere a gangplank lay ready for running out.  And high and clear\nin the lovely June night sailed the moon, spreading a faint\nbenign light upon hills and shores and glistening river, upon\nthe graceful, stately mail steamer, now advancing majestically\nupon the wharf boat.  Susan watched all, saw all, with quick\nbeating heart and quivering interest.  It was the first time that\nher life had been visited by the fascinating sense of event,\nreal event.  The tall, proud, impetuous child-woman, standing in\nthe semi-darkness beside her bundle, was about to cast her stake\nupon the table in a bold game with Destiny.  Her eyes shone with\nthe wonderful expression that is seen only when courage gazes\ninto the bright face of danger.\n\nThe steamer touched the edge of the wharf-boat with gentle care;\nthe wharf-boat swayed and groaned.  Even as the gangplanks were\npushing out, the ragged, fantastic roustabouts, with wild,\nsavage, hilarious cries, ran and jumped and scrambled to the\nwharf-boat like a band of escaping lunatics and darted down its\nshore planks to pounce upon the piles of freight.  The mate, at\nthe steamer edge to superintend the loading, and the wharf\nmaster on the levee beside the freight released each a hoarse\ntorrent of profanity to spur on the yelling, laughing\nroustabouts, more brute than man.  Torches flared; cow and sheep,\npig and chicken, uttered each its own cry of dissatisfaction or\ndismay; the mate and wharf master cursed because it was the\ncustom to curse; the roustabouts rushed ashore empty-handed,\ncame filing back, stooping under their burdens.  It was a scene\nof animation, of excitement, savage, grotesque, fascinating.\n\nSusan, trembling a little, so tense were her nerves, waited\nuntil the last struggling roustabouts were staggering on the\nboat, until the deep whistle sounded, warning of approaching\ndeparture.  Then she took up her bundle and put herself in the\nline of roustabouts, between a half-naked negro, black as coal\nand bearing a small barrel of beer, and a half-naked mulatto\nbearing a bundle of loud-smelling untanned skins.  \"Get out of\nthe way, lady!\" yelled the mate, eagerly seizing upon a new text\nfor his denunciations.  \"Get out of the way, you black hellions!\nLet the lady pass!  Look out, lady!  You damned sons of hell,\nwhat're you about!  I'll rip out your bowels----\"\n\nSusan fled across the deck and darted up the stairs to the\nsaloon.  The steamer was all white without except the black metal\nwork.  Within--that is, in the long saloon out of which the\ncabins opened to right and left and in which the meals were\nserved at extension tables--there was the palatial splendor of\nwhite and gilt.  At the forward end near the main entrance was\nthe office.  Susan, peering in from the darkness of the deck, saw\nthat the way was clear.  The Sutherland passengers had been\naccommodated.  She entered, put her bundle down, faced the clerk\nbehind the desk.\n\n\"Why, howdy, Miss Lenox,\" said he genially, beginning to twist\nhis narrow, carefully attended blond mustache.  \"Any of the folks\nwith you?\"\n\nShe remembered his face but not his name.  She remembered him as\none of the \"river characters\" regarded as outcast by the\nChristian respectability of Sutherland.  But she who could not\nbut be polite to everybody smiled pleasantly, though she did not\nlike his expression as he looked at her.  \"No, I'm alone,\" said she.\n\n\"Oh--your friends are going to meet you at the wharf in the\nmorning,\" said he, content with his own explanation.  \"Just sign\nhere, please.\" And, as she wrote, he went on:  \"I've got one room\nleft.  Ain't that lucky?  It's a nice one, too.  You'll be very\ncomfortable.  Everybody at home well?  I ain't been in Sutherland\nfor nigh ten years.  Every week or so I think I will, and then\nsomehow I don't.  Here's your key--number 34 right-hand side,\nwell down toward the far end, yonder.  Two dollars, please.  Thank\nyou--exactly right.  Hope you sleep well.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Susan.\n\nShe turned away with the key which was thrust through one end of\na stick about a foot long, to make it too bulky for\nabsent-minded passengers to pocket.  She took up her bundle,\nwalked down the long saloon with its gilt decorations, its\ncrystal chandeliers, its double array of small doors, each\nnumbered.  The clerk looked after her, admiration of the fine\ncurve of her shoulders, back, and hips written plain upon his\ninsignificant features.  And it was a free admiration he would\nnot have dared show had she not been a daughter of\nillegitimacy--a girl whose mother's \"looseness\" raised pleasing\nif scandalous suggestions and even possibilities in the mind of\nevery man with a carnal eye.  And not unnaturally.  To think of\nher was to think of the circumstances surrounding her coming\ninto the world; and to think of those circumstances was to think\nof immorality.\n\nSusan, all unconscious of that polluted and impudent gaze, was\nsoon standing before the narrow door numbered 34, as she barely\nmade out, for the lamps in the saloon chandeliers were turned\nlow.  She unlocked it, entered the small clean stateroom and\ndeposited her bundle on the floor.  With just a glance at her\nquarters she hurried to the opposite door--the one giving upon\nthe promenade.  She opened it, stepped out, crossed the deserted\ndeck and stood at the rail.\n\nThe _General Lytle_ was drawing slowly away from the wharf-boat.\nAs that part of the promenade happened to be sheltered from the\nsteamer's lights, she was seeing the panorama of Sutherland--its\nlong stretch of shaded waterfront, its cupolas and steeples, the\nwide leafy streets leading straight from the river by a gentle\nslope to the base of the dark towering bluffs behind the\ntown--all sleeping in peace and beauty in the soft light of the\nmoon.  That farthest cupola to the left--it was the Number Two\nengine house, and the third place from it was her uncle's house.\nSlowly the steamer, now in mid-stream, drew away from the town.\nOne by one the familiar landmarks--the packing house, the soap\nfactory, the Geiss brewery, the tall chimney of the pumping\nstation, the shorn top of Reservoir Hill--slipped ghostlily away\nto the southwest.  The sobs choked up into her throat and the\ntears rained from her eyes.  They all pitied and looked down on\nher there; still, it had been home the only home she ever had\nknown or ever would know.  And until these last few frightful\ndays, how happy she had been there!  For the first time she felt\ndesolate, weak, afraid.  But not daunted.  It is strange to see in\nstrong human character the strength and the weakness, two flat\ncontradictions, existing side by side and making weak what seems\nso strong and making strong what seems so weak.  However, human\ncharacter is a tangle of inconsistencies, as disorderly and\ninchoate as the tangible and visible parts of nature.  Susan felt\nweak, but not the kind of weakness that skulks.  And there lay\nthe difference, the abysmal difference, between courage and\ncowardice.  Courage has full as much fear as cowardice, often\nmore; but it has a something else that cowardice has not.  It\ntrembles and shivers but goes forward.\n\nWiping her eyes she went back to her own cabin.  She had\nneglected closing its other door, the one from the saloon.  The\nclerk was standing smirking in the doorway.\n\n\"You must be going away for quite some time,\" said he.  And he\nfixed upon her as greedy and impudent eyes as ever looked from\na common face.  It was his battle glance.  Guileful women, bent on\ntrimming him for anything from a piece of plated jewelry to a\nsaucer of ice cream, had led him to believe that before it walls\nof virtue tottered and fell like Jericho's before the trumpets\nof Joshua.\n\n\"It makes me a little homesick to see the old town disappear,\"\nhastily explained Susan, recovering herself.  The instant anyone\nwas watching, her emotions always hid.\n\n\"Wouldn't you like to sit out on deck a while?\" pursued the\nclerk, bringing up a winning smile to reinforce the fetching stare.\n\nThe idea was attractive, for she did not feel like sleep.  It\nwould be fine to sit out in the open, watch the moon and the\nstars, the mysterious banks gliding swiftly by, and new vistas\nalways widening out ahead.  But not with this puny, sandy little\n\"river character,\" not with anybody that night.  \"No,\" replied\nshe.  \"I think I'll go to bed.\"\n\nShe had hesitated--and that was enough to give him\nencouragement.  \"Now, do come,\" he urged.  \"You don't know how\nnice it is.  And they say I'm mighty good company.\"\n\n\"No, thanks.\" Susan nodded a pleasant dismissal.\n\nThe clerk lingered.  \"Can't I help you in some way?  Wouldn't you\nlike me to get you something?\"\n\n\"No--nothing.\"\n\n\"Going to visit in Cincinnati?  I know the town from A to Izzard.\nIt's a lot of fun over the Rhine.  I've had mighty good times\nthere--the kind a pretty, lively girl like you would take to.\"\n\n\"When do we get to Cincinnati?\"\n\n\"About eight--maybe half-past seven.  Depends on the landings we\nhave to make, and the freight.\"\n\n\"Then I'll not have much time for sleep,\" said Susan.  \"Good\nnight.\" And no more realizing the coldness of her manner than\nthe reason for his hanging about, she faced him, hand on the\ndoor to close it.\n\n\"You ain't a bit friendly,\" wheedled he.\n\n\"I'm sorry you think so.  Good night--and thank you.\" And he\ncould not but withdraw his form from the door.  She closed it and\nforgot him.  And she did not dream she had passed through one of\nthose perilous adventures incident to a female traveling\nalone--adventures that even in the telling frighten ladies whose\nnervousness for their safety seems to increase in direct\nproportion to the degree of tranquillity their charms create in\nthe male bosom.  She decided it would be unwise regularly to\nundress; the boat might catch fire or blow up or something.  She\ntook off skirt, hat and ties, loosened her waist, and lay upon\nthe lower of the two plain, hard little berths.  The throb of the\nengines, the beat of the huge paddles, made the whole boat\ntremble and shiver.  Faintly up from below came the sound of\nquarrels over crap-shooting, of banjos and singing--from the\nroustabouts amusing themselves between landings.  She thought she\nwould not be able to sleep in these novel and exciting\nsurroundings.  She had hardly composed herself before she lost\nconsciousness, to sleep on and on dreamlessly, without motion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nSHE was awakened by a crash so uproarious that she sat bolt\nupright before she had her eyes open.  Her head struck stunningly\nagainst the bottom of the upper berth.  This further confused her\nthoughts.  She leaped from the bed, caught up her slippers,\nreached for her opened-up bundle.  The crash was still billowing\nthrough the boat; she now recognized it as a great gong sounding\nfor breakfast.  She sat down on the bed and rubbed her head and\nlaughed merrily.  \"I _am_ a greenhorn!\" she said.  \"Another minute\nand I'd have had the whole boat laughing at me.\"\n\nShe felt rested and hungry--ravenously hungry.  She tucked in her\nblouse, washed as well as she could in the tiny bowl on the\nlittle washstand.  Then before the cloudy watermarked mirror she\narranged her scarcely mussed hair.  A charming vision of fresh\nyoung loveliness, strong, erect, healthy, bright of eye and of\ncheek, she made as, after a furtive look up and down the saloon,\nshe stepped from her door a very few minutes after the crash of\nthat gong.  With much scuffling and bustling the passengers, most\nof them country people, were hurrying into places at the tables\nwhich now had their extension leaves and were covered with\ncoarse white tablecloths and with dishes of nicked stoneware,\nwhite, indeed, but shabbily so.  But Susan's young eyes were not\ncritical.  To her it all seemed fine, with the rich flavor of\nadventure.  A more experienced traveler might have been filled\nwith gloomy foreboding by the quality of the odor from the\ncooking.  She found it delightful and sympathized with the\nunrestrained eagerness of the homely country faces about her,\nwith the children beating their spoons on their empty plates.\nThe colored waiters presently began to stream in, each wearing\na soiled white jacket, each bearing aloft a huge tray on which\nwere stacked filled dishes and steaming cups.\n\nColored people have a keen instinct for class.  One of the\nwaiters happened to note her, advanced bowing and smiling with\nthat good-humored, unservile courtesy which is the peculiar\npossession of the Americanized colored race.  He flourished her\ninto a chair with a \"Good morning, miss.  It's going to be a fine\nday.\" And as soon as she was seated he began to form round her\nplate a large inclosing arc of side dishes--fried fish, fried\nsteak, fried egg, fried potatoes, wheat cakes, canned peaches,\na cup of coffee.  He drew toward her a can of syrup, a pitcher of\ncream, and a bowl of granulated sugar.\n\n\"Anything else?\" said he, with a show of teeth white and sound.\n\n\"No--nothing.  Thank you so much.\"\n\nHer smile stimulated him to further courtesies.  \"Some likes the\nyeggs biled.  Shall I change 'em?\"\n\n\"No.  I like them this way.\" She was so hungry that the idea of\ntaking away a certainty on the chance of getting something out\nof sight and not yet cooked did not attract her.\n\n\"Perhaps--a little better piece of steak?\"\n\n\"No--this looks fine.\" Her enthusiasm was not mere politeness.\n\n\"I clean forgot your hot biscuits.\" And away he darted.\n\nWhen he came back with a heaping plate of hot biscuits, Sally\nLunn and cornbread, she was eating as heartily as any of her\nneighbors.  It seemed to her that never had she tasted such grand\nfood as this served in the white and gold saloon with\nstrangeness and interest all about her and the delightful sense\nof motion--motion into the fascinating golden unknown.  The men\nat the table were eating with their knives; each had one\nprotecting forearm and hand cast round his arc of small dishes\nas if to ward off probable attempt at seizure.  And they\nswallowed as if the boat were afire.  The women ate more\ndaintily, as became members of the finer sex on public\nexhibition.  They were wearing fingerless net gloves, and their\nlittle fingers stood straight out in that gesture which every\ntruly elegant woman deems necessary if the food is to be\ndaintily and artistically conveyed to her lips.  The children\nmussed and gormed themselves, their dishes, the tablecloth.\nSusan loved it all.  Her eyes sparkled.  She ate everything, and\nregretted that lack of capacity made it impossible for her to\nyield to the entreaties of her waiter that she \"have a little more.\"\n\nShe rose, went into the nearest passageway between saloon and\npromenade, stealthily took a ten-cent piece from her pocketbook.\nShe called her waiter and gave it to him.  She was blushing\ndeeply, frightened lest this the first tip she had ever given or\nseen given be misunderstood and refused.  \"I'm so much obliged,\"\nshe said.  \"You were very nice.\"\n\nThe waiter bowed like a prince, always with his simple, friendly\nsmile; the tip disappeared under his apron.  \"Nobody could help\nbeing nice to you, lady.\"\n\nShe thanked him again and went to the promenade.  It seemed to\nher that they had almost arrived.  Along shore stretched a\ncontinuous line of houses--pretty houses with gardens.  There\nwere electric cars.  Nearer the river lay several parallel lines\nof railway track along which train after train was speeding,\nsome of them short trains of ordinary day coaches, others long\ntrains made up in part of coaches grander and more beautiful\nthan any she had ever seen.  She knew they must be the parlor and\ndining and sleeping cars she had read about.  And now they were\nin the midst of a fleet of steamers and barges, and far ahead\nloomed the first of Cincinnati's big suspension bridges,\npictures of which she had many a time gazed at in wonder.  There\nwas a mingling of strange loud noises--whistles, engines, on the\nwater, on shore; there was a multitude of what seemed to her\nfeverish activities--she who had not been out of quiet\nSutherland since she was a baby too young to note things.\n\nThe river, the shores, grew more and more crowded.  Susan's eyes\ndarted from one new object to another; and eagerly though she\nlooked she felt she was missing more than she saw.\n\n\"Why, Susan Lenox!\" exclaimed a voice almost in her ear.\n\nShe closed her teeth upon a cry; suddenly she was back from\nwonderland to herself.  She turned to face dumpy, dressy Mrs.\nWaterbury and her husband with the glossy kinky ringlets and the\nlong wavy mustache.  \"How do you do?\" she stammered.\n\n\"We didn't know you were aboard,\" said Mrs. Waterbury, a silly,\nduck-legged woman looking proudly uncomfortable in her\nbead-trimmed black silk.\n\n\"Yes--I'm--I'm here,\" confessed Susan.\n\n\"Going to the city to visit?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan.  She hesitated, then repeated, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"What elegant breakfasts they do serve on these boats!  I suppose\nyour friends'll meet you.  But Mort and I'll look after you till\nthey come.\"\n\n\"Oh, it isn't necessary,\" protested Susan.  The steamer was\npassing under the bridge.  There were cities on both shores--huge\nmasses of dingy brick, streets filled with motion of every\nkind--always motion, incessant motion, and change.  \"We're about\nthere, aren't we?\" she asked.\n\n\"The wharf's up beyond the second bridge--the Covington Bridge,\"\nexplained Waterbury with the air of the old experienced\nglobe-trotter.  \"There's a third one, further up, but you can't\nsee it for the smoke.\" And he went on and on, volubly airing his\nintimate knowledge of the great city which he visited once a\nyear for two or three days to buy goods.  He ended with a\nscornful, \"My, but Cincinnati's a dirty place!\"\n\nDirty it might be, but Susan loved it, dirt and all.  The smoke,\nthe grime somehow seemed part of it, one of its charms, one of\nthe things that made it different from, and superior to,\nmonotonous country and country town.  She edged away from the\nWaterburys, hid in her stateroom watching the panorama through\nthe curtained glass of her promenade deck door.  She was\ncompletely carried away.  The city!  So, this was the city!  And\nher dreams of travel, of new sights, new faces, were beginning\nto come true.  She forgot herself, forgot what she had left\nbehind, forgot what she was to face.  All her power of thought\nand feeling was used up in absorbing these unfolding wonders.\nAnd when the June sun suddenly pierced the heavy clouds of fog and\nsmoke, she clasped her hands and gasped, \"Lovely!  Oh, how lovely!\"\n\nAnd now the steamer was at the huge wharf-boat, in shape like\nthe one at Sutherland, but in comparative size like the real\nNoah's Ark beside a toy ark.  And from the whole tremendous scene\nrose an enormous clamor, the stentorian voice of the city.  That\nvoice is discordant and terrifying to many.  To Susan, on that\nday, it was the most splendid burst of music.  \"Awake--awake!\" it\ncried.  \"Awake, and _live!_\" She opened her door that she might\nhear it better--rattle and rumble and roar, shriek of whistle,\nclang of bell.  And the people!--Thousands on thousands hurrying\nhither and yon, like bees in a hive.  \"Awake awake, and live!\"\n\nThe noises from the saloon reminded her that the journey was\nended, that she must leave the boat.  And she did not know where\nto go--she and her bundle.  She waited until she saw the\nWaterburys, along with the other passengers, moving up the\nlevee.  Then she issued forth--by the promenade deck door so that\nshe would not pass the office.  But at the head of the\ncompanionway, in the forward part of the deck, there the clerk\nstood, looking even pettier and more offensive by daylight.  She\nthought to slip by him.  But he stopped stroking his mustache and\ncalled out to her, \"Haven't your friends come?\"\n\nShe frowned, angry in her nervousness.  \"I shall get on very\nwell,\" she said curtly.  Then she repented, smiled politely,\nadded, \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"I'll put you in a carriage,\" he offered, hastening down the\nstairs to join her.\n\nShe did not know what to say or do.  She walked silently beside\nhim, he carrying her bundle.  They crossed the wharf-boat.  A line\nof dilapidated looking carriages was drawn up near the end of\nthe gangplank.  The sight of them, the remembrance of what she\nhad heard of the expensiveness of city carriages, nerved her to\ndesperation.  \"Give me my things, please,\" she said.  \"I think I'll\nwalk.\"\n\n\"Where do you want to go?\"\n\nThe question took her breath away.  With a quickness that amazed\nher, her lips uttered, \"The Gibson House.\"\n\n\"Oh!  That's a right smart piece.  But you can take a car.  I'll walk\nwith you to the car.  There's a line a couple of squares up that\ngoes almost by the door.  You know it isn't far from Fourth Street.\"\n\nShe was now in a flutter of terror.  She went stumbling along\nbeside him, not hearing a word of his voluble and flirtatious\ntalk.  They were in the midst of the mad rush and confusion.  The\nnoises, no longer mingled but individual, smote savagely upon\nher ears, startling her, making her look dazedly round as if\nexpecting death to swoop upon her.  At the corner of Fourth Street\nthe clerk halted.  He was clear out of humor with her, so dumb,\nso unappreciative.  \"There'll be a car along soon,\" said he sourly.\n\n\"You needn't wait,\" said she timidly.  \"Thank you again.\"\n\n\"You can't miss it.  Good-by.\" And he lifted his hat--\"tipped\"\nit, rather--for he would not have wasted a full lift upon such\na female.  She gave a gasp of relief when he departed; then a\ngasp of terror--for upon the opposite corner stood the\nWaterburys.  The globe-trotter and his wife were so dazed by the\ncity that they did not see her, though in their helpless\nglancing round they looked straight at her.  She hastily ran into\na drug store on the corner.  A young man in shirt sleeves held up\nby pink garters, and with oily black hair carefully parted and\nplastered, put down a pestle and mortar and came forward.  He had\nkind brown eyes, but there was something wrong with the lower\npart of his face.  Susan did not dare look to see what it was,\nlest he should think her unfeeling.  He was behind the counter.\nSusan saw the soda fountain.  As if by inspiration, she said,\n\"Some chocolate soda, please.\"\n\n\"Ice cream?\" asked the young man in a peculiar voice, like that\nof one who has a harelip.\n\n\"Please,\" said Susan.  And then she saw the sign, \"Ice Cream, ten\ncents,\" and wished she hadn't.\n\nThe young man mixed the soda, put in a liberal helping of ice\ncream, set it before her with a spoon in it, rested the knuckles\nof his brown hairy hands on the counter and said:\n\n\"It _is_ hot.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" assented Susan.  \"I wonder where I could leave my\nbundle for a while.  I'm a stranger and I want to look for a\nboarding house.\"\n\n\"You might leave it here with me,\" said the young man.  \"That's\nabout our biggest line of trade--that and postage stamps and\ntelephone--_and_ the directory.  \"He laughed heartily.  Susan did\nnot see why; she did not like the sound, either, for the young\nman's deformity of lower jaw deformed his laughter as well as\nhis speech.  However, she smiled politely and ate and drank her\nsoda slowly.\n\n\"I'll be glad to take care of your bundle,\" the young man said\npresently.  \"Ever been here before?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan.  \"That is, not since I was about four years old.\"\n\n\"I was four,\" said the young man, \"when a horse stepped on my\nmouth in the street.\"\n\n\"My, how dreadful!\" exclaimed Susan.\n\n\"You can see some of the scar yet,\" the young man assured her,\nand he pointed to his curiously sunken mouth.  \"The doctors said\nit was the most remarkable case of the kind on record,\"\ncontinued he proudly.  \"That was what led me into the medical\nline.  You don't seem to have your boarding house picked.\"\n\n\"I was going to look in the papers.\"\n\n\"That's dangerous--especially for a young lady.  Some of them\nboarding houses--well, they're no better'n they ought to be.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose you know of any?\"\n\n\"My aunt keeps one.  And she's got a vacancy, it being summer.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it'd be too expensive for me,\" said Susan, to feel her way.\n\nThe young man was much flattered.  But he said, \"Oh, it ain't so\ntoppy.  I think you could make a deal with her for five per.\"\n\nSusan looked inquiring.\n\n\"Five a week--room and board.\"\n\n\"I might stand that,\" said Susan reflectively.  Then, deciding\nfor complete confidence, \"I'm looking for work, too.\"\n\n\"What line?\"\n\n\"Oh, I never tried anything.  I thought maybe dressmaking or millinery.\"\n\n\"Mighty poor season for jobs.  The times are bad, anyhow.\" He was\nlooking at her with kindly curiosity.  \"If I was you, I'd go back\nhome--and wait.\"\n\nSusan shrank within herself.  \"I can't do that,\" she said.\n\nThe young man thought awhile, then said:  \"If you should go to my\naunt's, you can say Mr. Ellison sent you.  No, that ain't me.\nIt's the boss.  You see, a respectable boarding house asks for\nreferences.\"\n\nSusan colored deeply and her gaze slowly sank.  \"I didn't know\nthat,\" she murmured.\n\n\"Don't be afraid.  Aunt Kate ain't so particular--leastways, not\nin summer when things is slow.  And I know you're quiet.\"\n\nBy the time the soda was finished, the young man--who said his\nname was Robert Wylie--had written on the back of Ellison's\nbusiness card in a Spencerian hand:  \"Mrs. Kate Wylie, 347 West\nSixth Street.\" He explained that Susan was to walk up two\nsquares and take the car going west; the conductor would let her\noff at the right place.  \"You'd better leave your things here,\"\nsaid Mr. Wylie, holding up the card so that they could admire\nhis penmanship together.  \"You may not hit it off with Aunt Kate.\nDon't think you've got to stay there just because of me.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I'll like it,\" Susan declared confidently.  Her spirits\nwere high; she felt that she was in a strong run of luck.\n\nWylie lifted her package over the counter and went to the door\nwith her to point out the direction.  \"This is Fourth.  The next\nup is Fifth.  The next wide one is Sixth--and you can read it on\nthe lamp-post, too.\"\n\n\"Isn't that convenient!\" exclaimed Susan.  \"What a lovely city this is!\"\n\n\"There's worse,\" said Mr. Wylie, not to seem vain of his native town.\n\nThey shook hands most friendly and she set out in the direction\nhe had indicated.  She was much upset by the many vehicles and\nthe confusion, but she did her best to seem at ease and at home.\nShe watched a girl walking ahead of her--a shopgirl who seemed\nwell-dressed and stylish, especially about the hat and hair.\nSusan tried to walk like her.  \"I suppose I look and act greener\nthan I really am,\" thought she.  \"But I'll keep my eyes open and\ncatch on.\" And in this, as in all her thoughts and actions since\nleaving, she showed confidence not because she was conceited,\nbut because she had not the remotest notion what she was\nactually attempting.  How many of us get credit for courage as we\nwalk unconcerned through perils, or essay and conquer great\nobstacles, when in truth we are not courageous but simply\nunaware!  As a rule knowledge is power or, rather, a source of\npower, but there are times when ignorance is a power and\nknowledge a weakness.  If Susan had known, she might perhaps have\nstayed at home and submitted and, with crushed spirit, might\nhave sunk under the sense of shame and degradation.  But she did\nnot know; so Columbus before his sailors or Caesar at the\nRubicon among his soldiers did not seem more tranquil than she\nreally was.  Wylie, who suspected in the direction of the truth,\nwondered at her.  \"She's game, she is,\" he muttered again and\nagain that morning.  \"What a nerve for a kid--and a lady, too!\"\n\nShe found the right corner and the right car without further\nadventure; and the conductor assured her that he would set her\ndown before the very door of the address on the card.  It was an\nopen car with few passengers.  She took the middle of the long\nseat nearest the rear platform and looked about her like one in\na happy dream.  On and on and yet on they went.  With every square\nthey passed more people, so it seemed to her, than there were in\nall Sutherland.  And what huge stores!  And what wonderful\ndisplays of things to wear!  Where would the people be found to\nbuy such quantities, and where would they get the money to pay?\nHow many restaurants and saloons!  Why, everybody must be eating\nand drinking all the time.  And at each corner she looked up and\ndown the cross streets, and there were more and ever more\nmagnificent buildings, throngs upon throngs of people.  Was there\nno end to it?  This was Sixth Street, still Sixth Street, as she\nsaw at the corner lamp-posts.  Then there must be five more such\nstreets between this and the river; and she could see, up the\ncross streets, that the city was even vaster in the direction of\nthe hills.  And there were all these cross streets!  It was\nstupefying--overwhelming--incredible.\n\nShe began to be nervous, they were going so far.  She glanced\nanxiously at the conductor.  He was watching her interestedly,\nunderstood her glance, answered it with a reassuring nod.  He\ncalled out:\n\n\"I'm looking out for you, miss.  I've got you on my mind.  Don't\nyou fret.\"\n\nShe gave him a bright smile of relief.  They were passing through\na double row of what seemed to her stately residences, and there\nwere few people on the sidewalks.  The air, too, was clearer,\nthough the walls were grimy and also the grass in the occasional\ntiny front yards.  But the curtains at the windows looked clean\nand fresh, and so did the better class of people among those on\nthe sidewalk.  It delighted her to see so many well-dressed\nwomen, wearing their clothes with an air which she told herself\nshe must acquire.  She was startled by the conductor's calling out:\n\n\"Now, miss!\"\n\nShe rose as he rang the bell and was ready to get off when the\ncar stopped, for she was eager to cause him as little trouble as\npossible.\n\n\"The house is right straight before you,\" said the conductor.\n\"The number's in the transom.\"\n\nShe thanked him, descended, was on the sidewalk before Mrs.\nWylie's.  She looked at the house and her heart sank.  She thought\nof the small sum in her purse; it was most unlikely that such a\nhouse as this would harbor her.  For here was a grand stone\nstairway ascending to a deep stone portico, and within it great\ndoors, bigger than those of the Wright mansion, the palace of\nSutherland.  However, she recalled the humble appearance and mode\nof speech of her friend the drug clerk and plucked up the\ncourage to ascend and to ring.\n\nA slattern, colored maid opened the door.  At the first glance\nwithin, at the first whiff of the interior air, Susan felt more\nat ease.  For she was seeing what even her bedazzled eyes\nrecognized as cheap dowdiness, and the smell that assailed her\nnostrils was that of a house badly and poorly kept--the smell of\ncheap food and bad butter cooking, of cats, of undusted rooms,\nof various unrecognizable kinds of staleness.  She stood in the\ncenter of the big dingy parlor, gazing round at the grimed\nchromos until Mrs. Wylie entered--a thin middle-aged woman with\nsmall brown eyes set wide apart, a perpetual frown, and a chin\nso long and so projected that she was almost jimber-jawed.  While\nSusan explained stammeringly what she had come for, Mrs. Wylie\neyed her with increasing disfavor.  When Susan had finished, she\nunlocked her lips for the first time to say:\n\n\"The room's took.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Susan in dismay.\n\nThe telephone rang in the back parlor.  Mrs. Wylie excused\nherself to answer.  After a few words she closed the doors\nbetween.  She was gone fully five minutes; to Susan it seemed an\nhour.  She came back, saying:\n\n\"I've been talking to my nephew.  He called up.  Well, I reckon\nyou can have the room.  It ain't my custom to take in ladies as\nyoung as you.  But you seem to be all right.  Your parents allowed\nyou to come?\"\n\n\"I haven't any,\" replied Susan.  \"I'm here to find a place and\nsupport myself.\"\n\nMrs. Wylie continued to eye her dubiously.  \"Well, I have no wish\nto pry into your affairs.  'Mind your own business,' that's my\nrule.\" She spoke with defiance, as if the contrary were being\nasserted by some invisible person who might appear and gain\nhearing and belief.  She went on:  \"If Mr. Ellison wants it, why I\nsuppose it's all right.  But you can't stay out later'n ten o'clock.\"\n\n\"I shan't go out at all of nights,\" said Susan eagerly.\n\n\"You _look_ quiet,\" said Mrs. Wylie, with the air of adding that\nappearances were rarely other than deceptive.\n\n\"Oh, I _am_ quiet,\" declared Susan.  It puzzled her, this\nrecurrence of the suggestion of noisiness.\n\n\"I can't allow much company--none in your room.\"\n\n\"There won't be any company.\" She blushed deeply.  \"That is, a--a\nyoung man from our town--he may call once.  But he'll be off for\nthe East right away.\"\n\nMrs. Wylie reflected on this, Susan the while standing uneasily,\ndreading lest decision would be against her.  Finally Mrs. Wylie said:\n\n\"Robert says you want the five-dollar room.  I'll show it to you.\"\n\nThey ascended two flights through increasing shabbiness.  On the\nthird floor at the rear was a room--a mere continuation of the\nnarrow hall, partitioned off.  It contained a small folding bed,\na small table, a tiny bureau, a washstand hardly as large as\nthat in the cabin on the boat, a row of hooks with a curtain of\nflowered chintz before them, a kitchen chair, a chromo of \"Awake\nand Asleep,\" a torn and dirty rag carpet.  The odor of the room,\nstale, damp, verging on moldy, seemed the fitting exhalation\nfrom such an assemblage of forbidding objects.\n\n\"It's a nice, comfortable room,\" said Mrs. Wylie aggressively.\n\"I couldn't afford to give it and two meals for five dollars\nexcept till the first of September.  After that it's eight.\"\n\n\"I'll be glad to stay, if you'll let me,\" said Susan.  Mrs.\nWylie's suspicion, so plain in those repellent eyes, took all\nthe courage out of her.  The great adventure seemed rapidly to be\nlosing its charms.  She could not think of herself as content or\nanything but sad and depressed in such surroundings as these.\nHow much better it would be if she could live out in the open,\nout where it was attractive!\n\n\"I suppose you've got some baggage,\" said Mrs. Wylie, as if she\nrather expected to hear that she had not.\n\n\"I left it at the drug store,\" explained Susan.\n\n\"Your trunk?\"\n\nSusan started nervously at that explosive exclamation.  \"I--I\nhaven't got a trunk--only a few things in a shawl strap.\"\n\n\"Well, I never!\"\n\nMrs. Wylie tossed her head, clucked her tongue disgustedly\nagainst the roof of her mouth.  \"But I suppose if Mr. Ellison\nsays so, why you can stay.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Susan humbly.  Even if it would not have been\nbasest ingratitude to betray her friend, Mr. Wylie, still she\nwould not have had the courage to confess the truth about Mr.\nEllison and so get herself ordered into the street.  \"I--I think\nI'll go for my things.\"\n\n\"The custom is to pay in advance,\" said Mrs. Wylie sharply.\n\n\"Oh, yes--of course,\" stammered Susan.\n\nShe seated herself on the wooden chair and opened out her purse.\nShe found the five among her few bills, extended it with\ntrembling fingers toward Mrs. Wylie.  At the same time she lifted\nher eyes.  The woman's expression as she bored into the\npocketbook terrified her.  Never before had she seen the savage\ngreediness that is bred in the city among the people who fight\nagainst fearful odds to maintain their respectability and to\nsave themselves from the ever threatened drop to the despised\nworking class.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Mrs. Wylie, taking the bill as if she were\nconferring a favor upon Susan.  \"I make everybody pay promptly.\nThe first of the week or out they go!  I used to be easy and I\ncame near going down.\"\n\n\"Oh, I shouldn't stay a minute if I couldn't pay,\" said the\ngirl.  \"I'm going to look for something right away.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't want to discourage you, but there's a great many\nout of work.  Still, I suppose you'll be able to wheedle some man\ninto giving you a job.  But I warn you I'm very particular about\nmorals.  If I see any signs----\"  Mrs. Wylie did not finish her\nsentence.  Any words would have been weaker than her look.\n\nSusan colored and trembled.  Not at the poisonous hint as to how\nmoney could be got to keep on paying for that room, for the hint\npassed wide of Susan.  She was agitated by the thought:  if Mrs.\nWylie should learn that she was not respectable!  If Mrs. Wylie\nshould learn that she was nameless--was born in disgrace so deep\nthat, no matter how good she might be, she would yet be classed\nwith the wicked.\n\n\"I'm down like a thousand of brick on any woman that is at all\nloose with the men,\" continued the landlady.  \"I never could\nunderstand how any woman could so far forget herself.\" And the\nwoman whom the men had all her life been helping to their\nuttermost not to \"forget herself\" looked sharp suspicion and\nenvy at Susan, the lovely.  Why are women of the Mrs. Wylie sort\nso swift to suspect?  Can it be that in some secret chamber of\ntheir never assailed hearts there lurks a longing--a feeling as\nto what they would do if they had the chance?  Mrs. Wylie\ncontinued, \"I hope you have strict Christian principles?\"\n\n\"I was brought up Presbyterian,\" said Susan anxiously.  She was\nfar from sure that in Cincinnati and by its Mrs. Wylies\nPresbyterian would be regarded as Christian.\n\n\"There's your kind of a church a few squares from here,\" was all\nMrs. Wylie deigned to reply.  Susan suspected a sneer at\nPresbyterianism in her accent.\n\n\"That'll be nice,\" she murmured.  She was eager to escape.  \"I'll\ngo for my things.\"\n\n\"You can walk down and take the Fourth Street car,\" suggested\nher landlady.  \"Then you can watch out and not miss the store.\nThe conductors are very impudent and forgetful.\"\n\nSusan escaped from the house as speedily as her flying feet\nwould take her down the two flights.  In the street once more,\nher spirits rose.  She went south to Fourth Street, decided to\nwalk instead of taking a car.  She now found herself in much more\nimpressive surroundings than before, and realized that Sixth\nStreet was really one of the minor streets.  The further uptown\nshe went, the more excited she became.  After the district of\nstately mansions with wonderful carriages driving up and away\nand women dressed like those in the illustrated story papers,\ncame splendid shops and hotels, finer than Susan had believed\nthere were anywhere in the world.  And most of the people--the\ncrowds on crowds of people!--looked prosperous and cheerful and\nso delightfully citified!  She wondered why so many of the men\nstared at her.  She assumed it must be something rural in her\nappearance though that ought to have set the women to staring,\ntoo.  But she thought little about this, so absorbed was she in\nseeing all the new things.  She walked slowly, pausing to inspect\nthe shop windows--the gorgeous dresses and hats and jewelry, the\nthousand costly things scattered in careless profusion.  And the\ncrowds!  How secure she felt among these multitudes of strangers,\nnot one of them knowing or suspecting her secret of shame!  She\nno longer had the sense of being outcast, branded.\n\nWhen she had gone so far that it seemed to her she certainly\nmust have missed the drug store, carefully though she had\ninspected each corner as she went, she decided that she must\nstop someone of this hurrying throng and inquire the way.  While\nshe was still screwing her courage to this boldness, she espied\nthe sign and hastened joyfully across the street.  She and Wylie\nwelcomed each other like old friends.  He was delighted when he\nlearned that she had taken the room.\n\n\"You won't mind Aunt Kate after a while,\" said he.  \"She's sour\nand nosey, but she's honest and respectable--and that's the main\nthing just now with you.  And I think you'll get a job all right.\nAunt Kate's got a lady friend that's head saleslady at\nShillito's.  She'll know of something.\"\n\nWylie was so kind and so hopeful that Susan felt already\nsettled.  As soon as customers came in, she took her parcel and\nwent, Wylie saying, \"I'll drop round after supper and see how\nthings are getting on.\" She took the Sixth Street car back, and\nfelt like an old resident.  She was critical of Sixth Street now,\nand of the women she had been admiring there less than two hours\nbefore--critical of their manners and of their dress.  The\nexterior of the boarding house no longer awed her.  She was\ngetting a point of view--as she proudly realized.  By the time\nSam came--and surely that wouldn't be many days--she would be\nquite transformed.\n\nShe mounted the steps and was about to ring when Mrs. Wylie\nherself, with stormy brow and snapping eyes, opened the door.\n\"Go into the parlor,\" she jerked out from between her\nunpleasant-looking receding teeth.\n\nSusan gave her a glance of frightened wonder and obeyed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nAT the threshold her bundles dropped to the floor and all color\nfled from her face.  Before her stood her Uncle George and Sam\nWright and his father.  The two elderly men were glowering at\nher; Sam, white as his shirt and limp, was hanging his head.\n\n\"So, miss!--You've got back, eh?\" cried her uncle in a tone she\nwould not have believed could come from him.\n\nAs quickly as fear had seized her she now shook it off.  \"Yes,\nUncle,\" she said calmly, meeting his angry eyes without\nflinching.  And back came that expression of resolution--of\nstubbornness we call it when it is the flag of opposition to\n_our_ will.\n\n\"What'd have become of you,\" demanded her uncle, \"if I hadn't\nfound out early this morning, and got after Sam here and choked\nthe truth out of him?\"\n\nSusan gazed at Sam; but he was such a pitiful figure, so mean and\nfrightened, that she glanced quickly back to her uncle.  She said:\n\n\"But he didn't know where I was.\"\n\n\"Don't lie to me,\" cried Warham.  \"It won't do you any good, any\nmore than his lying kept us from finding you.  We came on the\ntrain and saw the Waterburys in the street and they'd seen you\ngo into the drug store.  We'd have caught you there if we'd been\na few minutes sooner, but we drove, and got here in time.  Now,\ntell me, Susan\"--and his voice was cruelly harsh--\"all about\nwhat's been going on between you and Sam.\"\n\nShe gazed fearlessly and was silent.\n\n\"Speak up!\" commanded Sam's father.\n\n\"Yes--and no lies,\" said her uncle.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" Susan at last answered--truthfully\nenough, yet to gain time, too.\n\n\"You can't play that game any longer,\" cried Warham.  \"You did make\na fool of me, but my eyes are open.  Your aunt's right about you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Uncle George!\" said the girl, a sob in her voice.\n\nBut he gazed pitilessly--gazed at the woman he was now abhorring\nas the treacherous, fallen, unsexed daughter of fallen Lorella.\n\"Speak out.  Crying won't help you.  What have you and this fellow\nbeen up to?  You disgrace!\"\n\nSusan shrank and shivered, but answered steadfastly, \"That's\nbetween him and me, Uncle.\"\n\nWarham gave a snort of fury, turned to the elder Wright.  \"You\nsee, Wright,\" cried he.  \"It's as my wife and I told you.  Your\nboy's lying.  We'll send the landlady out for a preacher and\nmarry them.\"\n\n\"Hold on, George,\" objected Wright soothingly.  \"I agreed to that\nonly if there'd been something wrong.  I'm not satisfied yet.\" He\nturned to Susan, said in his gruff, blunt way:\n\n\"Susan, have you been loose with my boy here?\"\n\n\"Loose?\" said Susan wonderingly.\n\nSam roused himself.  \"Tell them it isn't so, Susan,\" he pleaded,\nand his voice was little better than a whine of terror.  \"Your\nuncle's going to kill me and my father'll kick me out.\"\n\nSusan's heart grew sick as she looked at him--looked furtively,\nfor she was ashamed to see him so abject.  \"If you mean did I let\nhim kiss me,\" she said to Mr. Wright, \"why, I did.  We kissed\nseveral times.  But we had the right to.  We were engaged.\"\n\nSam turned on his father in an agony of terror.  \"That isn't\ntrue!\" he cried.  \"I swear it isn't, father.  We aren't engaged.  I\nonly made love to her a little, as a fellow does to lots of girls.\"\n\nSusan looked at him with wide, horrified eyes.  \"Sam!\" she\nexclaimed breathlessly.  \"Sam!\"\n\nSam's eyes dropped, but he managed to turn his face in her\ndirection.  The situation was too serious for him; he did not\ndare to indulge in such vanities as manhood or manly appearance.\n\"That's the truth, Susan,\" he said sullenly.  \"_You_ talked a lot\nabout marrying but _I_ never thought of such a thing.\"\n\n\"But--you said--you loved me.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean anything by it.\"\n\nThere fell a silence that was interrupted by Mr. Wright.  \"You\nsee there's nothing in it, Warham.  I'll take my boy and go.\"\n\n\"Not by a damn sight!\" cried Warham.  \"He's got to marry her.\nSusan, did Sam promise to marry you?\"\n\n\"When he got through college,\" replied Susan.\n\n\"I thought so!  And he persuaded you to run away.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan.  \"He----\"\n\n\"I say yes,\" stormed her uncle.  \"Don't lie!\"\n\n\"Warham!  Warham!\" remonstrated Mr. Wright.  \"Don't browbeat the girl.\"\n\n\"He begged me not to go,\" said Susan.\n\n\"You lying fool!\" shouted her uncle.  Then to Wright, \"If he did\nask her to stay it was because he was afraid it would all come\nout--just as it has.\"\n\n\"I never promised to marry her!\" whined Sam.  \"Honest to God,\nfather, I never did.  Honest to God, Mr. Warham!  You know that's\nso, Susan.  It was you that did all the marrying talk.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said slowly.  \"Yes, I believe it was.\" She looked\ndazedly at the three men.  \"I supposed he meant marriage\nbecause--\" her voice faltered, but she steadied it and went\non--\"because we loved each other.\"\n\n\"I knew it!\" cried her uncle.  \"You hear, Wright?  She admits he\nbetrayed her.\"\n\nSusan remembered the horrible part of her cousin's sex\nrevelations.  \"Oh, no!\" she cried.  \"I wouldn't have let him do\nthat--even if he had wanted to.  No--not even if we'd been married.\"\n\n\"You see, Warham!\" cried Mr. Wright, in triumph.\n\n\"I see a liar!\" was Warham's furious answer.  \"She's trying to\ndefend him and make out a case for herself.\"\n\n\"I am telling the truth,\" said Susan.\n\nWarham gazed unbelievingly at her, speechless with fury.  Mr.\nWright took his silk hat from the corner of the piano.  \"I'm\nsatisfied they're innocent,\" said he.  \"So I'll take my boy and go.\"\n\n\"Not if I know it!\" retorted Warham.  \"He's got to marry her.\"\n\n\"But the girl says she's pure, says he never spoke of marriage,\nsays he begged her not to run away.  Be reasonable, Warham.\"\n\n\"For a good Christian,\" sneered he at Wright, \"you're mighty\neasily convinced by a flimsy lie.  In your heart you know the boy\nhas wronged her and that she's shielding him, just as----\"  There\nWarham checked himself; it would be anything but timely to\nremind Wright of the character of the girl's mother.\n\n\"I'll admit,\" said Mr. Wright smoothly, \"that I\nwasn't overanxious for my boy's marriage with a girl whose\nmother was--unfortunate.  But if your charge had been true,\nWarham, I'd have made the boy do her justice, she being only\nseventeen.  Come, Sam.\"\n\nSam slunk toward the door.  Warham stared fiercely at the elder\nWright.  \"And you call yourself a Christian!\" he sneered.\n\nAt the door--Sam had already disappeared--Mr. Wright paused to\nsay, \"I'm going to give Sam a discipline he'll remember.  The\ngirl's only been foolish.  Don't be harsh with her.\"\n\n\"You damned hypocrite!\" shouted Warham.  \"I might have known what\nto expect from a man who cut the wages of his hands to pay his\nchurch subscription.\"\n\nBut Wright was far too crafty to be drawn.  He went on pushing\nSam before him.\n\nAs the outer door closed behind them Mrs. Wylie appeared.  \"I\nwant you both to get out of my house as quick as you can,\" she\nsnapped.  \"My boarders'll be coming to dinner in a few minutes.\"\n\nWarham took his straw hat from the floor beside the chair behind\nhim.  \"I've nothing to do with this girl here.  Good day, madam.\"\nAnd he strode out of the house, slamming the door behind him.\n\nMrs. Wylie looked at Susan with storming face and bosom.  Susan\ndid not see.  She was gazing into space, her face blanched.\n\"Clear out!\" cried Mrs. Wylie.  And she ran to the outer door and\nopened it.  \"How dare you come into a respectable house!\" She\nwished to be so wildly angry that she would forget the five\ndollars which she, as a professing Christian in full church\nstanding, would have to pay back if she remembered.  \"Clear out\nthis minute!\" she cried shrilly.  \"If you don't, I'll throw your\nbundle into the street and you after it.\"\n\nSusan took up the bundle mechanically, slowly went out on the\nstoop.  The door closed with a slam behind her.  She descended\nthe steps, walked a few yards up the street, paused at the edge\nof the curb and looked dazedly about.  Her uncle stood beside\nher.  \"Now where are you going?\" he said roughly.\n\nSusan shook her head.\n\n\"I suppose,\" he went on, \"I've got to look after you.  You shan't\ndisgrace my daughter any further.\"\n\nSusan simply looked at him, her eyes unseeing, her brain swept\nclean of thought by the cyclone that had destroyed all her\ndreams and hopes.  She was not horrified by his accusations; such\nthings had little meaning for one practically in complete\nignorance of sex relations.  Besides, the miserable fiasco of her\nromantic love left her with a feeling of abasement, of\ndegradation little different from that which overwhelms a woman\nwho believes her virtue is her all and finds herself betrayed\nand abandoned.  She now felt indeed the outcast, looked down upon\nby all the world.\n\n\"If you hadn't lied,\" he fumed on, \"you'd have been his wife and\na respectable woman.\"\n\nThe girl shivered.\n\n\"Instead, you're a disgrace.  Everybody in Sutherland'll know\nyou've gone the way your mother went.\"\n\n\"Go away,\" said the girl piteously.  \"Let me alone.\"\n\n\"Alone?  What will become of you?\" He addressed the question to\nhimself, not to her.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" was her reply in a dreary tone.  \"I've been\nbetrayed, as my mother was.  It doesn't matter what----\"\n\n\"I knew it!\" cried Warham, with no notion of what the girl meant\nby the word \"betrayed.\" \"Why didn't you confess the truth while\nhe was here and his father was ready to marry him to you?  I knew\nyou'd been loose with him, as your Aunt Fanny said.\"\n\n\"But I wasn't,\" said Susan.  \"I wouldn't do such a thing.\"\n\n\"There you go, lying again!\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" said she.  \"All I want is for you to go away.\"\n\n\"You do?\" sneered he.  \"And then what?  I've got to think of\nRuthie.\" He snatched the bundle from her hand.  \"Come on!  I must\ndo all I can to keep the disgrace to my family down.  As for you,\nyou don't deserve anything but the gutter, where you'd sink if\nI left you.  Your aunt's right.  You're rotten.  You were born\nrotten.  You're your mother's own brat.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" she cried.  \"And I'm proud of it!\" She turned from\nhim, was walking rapidly away.\n\n\"Come with me!\" ordered Warham, following and seizing her by the arm.\n\n\"No,\" said Susan, wrenching herself free.\n\n\"Then I'll call a policeman and have you locked up.\"\n\nUncle and niece stood regarding each other, hatred and contempt\nin his gaze, hatred and fear in hers.\n\n\"You're a child in law--though, God knows, you're anything but\na child in fact.  Come along with me.  You've got to.  I'm going to\nsee that you're put out of harm's way.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't take me back to Sutherland!\" she cried.\n\nHe laughed savagely.  \"I guess not!  You'll not show your face\nthere again--though I've no doubt you'd be brazen enough to\nbrass it out.  No--you can't pollute my home again.\"\n\n\"I can't go back to Sutherland!\"\n\n\"You shan't, I say.  You ran off because you had disgraced yourself.\"\n\n\"No!\" cried Susan.  \"No!\"\n\n\"Don't lie to me!  Don't speak to me.  I'll see what I can do to\nhide this mess.  Come along!\"\n\nSusan looked helplessly round the street, saw nothing, not even\neager, curious faces pressed against many a window pane, saw\nonly a desolate waste.  Then she walked along beside her uncle,\nboth of them silent, he carrying her bundle, she tightly\nclutching her little purse.\n\n\nPerhaps the most amazing, the most stunning, of all the blows\nfate had thus suddenly showered upon her was this transformation\nof her uncle from gentleness to ferocity.  But many a far older\nand far wiser woman than seventeen-year-old Susan has failed to\nunderstand how it is with the man who does not regard woman as\na fellow human being.  To such she is either an object of\nadoration, a quintessence of purity and innocence, or less than\nthe dust, sheer filth.  Warham's anger was no gust.  He was simply\nthe average man of small intelligence, great vanity, and abject\nsnobbishness or terror of public opinion.  There could be but one\nreason for the flight of Lorella's daughter--rottenness.  The\nonly point to consider now was how to save the imperiled family\nstanding, how to protect his own daughter, whom his good nature\nand his wife's weakness had thus endangered.  The one thing that\ncould have appeased his hatred of Susan would have been her\nmarriage to Sam Wright.  Then he would have--not, indeed,\nforgiven or reinstated her--but tolerated her.  It is the\ndominance of such ideas as his that makes for woman the slavery\nshe discovers beneath her queenly sway if she happens to do\nsomething deeply displeasing to her masculine subject and adorer.\n\nThey went to the Central Station.  The O. and M. express which\nconnected with the train on the branch line to Sutherland would\nnot leave until a quarter past two.  It was only a few minutes\npast one.  Warham led the way into the station restaurant; with\na curt nod he indicated a seat at one of the small tables, and\ndropped into the opposite seat.  He ordered beefsteak and fried\npotatoes, coffee and apple pie.\n\n\"Sit still!\" he said to her roughly and rose to go out to buy a paper.\n\nThe girl sat with her hands in her lap and her eyes upon them.\nShe looked utterly, pitifully tired.  A moment and he came back\nto resume his seat and read the paper.  When the waiter flopped\ndown the steak and the dish of greasily fried potatoes before\nhis plate, he stuffed the paper in his pocket, cut a slice of\nthe steak and put it on the plate.  The waiter noisily exchanged\nit for the empty plate before Susan.  Warham cut two slices of\nthe steak for himself, took a liberal helping of the potatoes,\npushed the dish toward her.\n\n\"Do you want the coffee now, or with the pie?\" asked the waiter.\n\n\"Now,\" said Warham.\n\n\"Coffee for the young lady, too?\"\n\nWarham scowled at her.  \"Coffee?\" he demanded.\n\nShe did not answer; she did not hear.\n\n\"Yes, she wants coffee,\" said Warham.  \"Hustle it!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" And the waiter bustled away with a great deal of\nmotion that created a deceptive impression of speed.  Warham was\nhelping himself to steak again when the coffee came a\nsuspicious-looking liquid diffusing an odor of staleness\nreheated again and again, an under odor of metal pot not too\nfrequently scoured.\n\nWarham glanced at Susan's plate.  She had not disturbed the knife\nand fork on either side of it.  \"Eat!\" he commanded.  And when she\ngave no sign of having heard, he repeatedly sharply, \"Eat, I\ntell you.\"\n\nShe started, nervously took up the knife and fork, cut a morsel\noff the slice of steak.  When she lifted it to her lips, she\nsuddenly put it back in the plate.  \"I can't,\" she said.\n\n\"You've got to,\" ordered he.  \"I won't have you acting this way.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" she repeated monotonously.  \"I feel sick.\" Nature had\nluckily so made her that it was impossible for her to swallow\nwhen her nerves were upset or when she was tired; thus, she\nwould not have the physical woes that aggravate and prolong\nmental disturbance if food is taken at times when it instantly\nturns to poison.\n\nHe repeated his order in a still more savage tone.  She put her\nelbows on the table, rested her head wearily upon her hands,\nshook her head.  He desisted.\n\nWhen he had eaten all of the steak, except the fat and the\ngristly tail, and nearly all the potatoes, the waiter took the\nused dishes away and brought two generous slices of apple pie\nand set down one before each.  With the pie went a cube of\nAmerican cream or \"rat-trap\" cheese.  Warham ate his own pie and\ncheese; then, as she had not touched hers, he reached for it and\nate it also.  Now he was watching the clock and, between liftings\nof laden fork to his mouth, verifying the clock's opinion of the\nhour by his own watch.  He called for the bill, paid it, gave the\nwaiter five cents--a concession to the tipping custom of the\neffete city which, judging by the waiter's expression, might as\nwell not have been made.  Still, Warham had not made it with an\nidea of promoting good feeling between himself and the waiter,\nbut simply to show that he knew the city and its ways.  He took\nup the shawl strap, said, \"Come on\" in the voice which he deemed\nworthy of the fallen creature he must, through Christian duty\nand worldly prudence, for the time associate with.  She rose and\nfollowed him to the ticket office.  He had the return half of his\nown ticket.  When she heard him ask for a ticket to North\nSutherland she shivered.  She knew that her destination was his\nbrother Zeke's farm.\n\nFrom Cincinnati to North Vernon, where they were to change cars,\nhe sat beside her without speech.  At North Vernon, where they\nhad to occupy a bench outside the squat and squalid station for\nnearly two hours, he sat beside her without speech.  And without\na single word on either side they journeyed in the poking,\nno-sooner-well-started-than-stopping accommodation train\nsouthbound.  Several Sutherland people were aboard.  He nodded\nsurlily to those who spoke to him.  He read an Indianapolis paper\nwhich he had bought at North Vernon.  All the way she gazed\nunseeingly out over the fair June landscape of rolling or hilly\nfields ripening in the sun.\n\nAt North Sutherland he bade her follow him to a dilapidated barn\na few yards from the railway tracks, where was displayed a\nhomemade sign--\"V. Goslin.  Livery and Sale Stable.\" There was\ndickering and a final compromise on four dollars where the\nproprietor had demanded five and Warham had declared two fifty\nliberal.  A surrey was hitched with two horses.  Warham opened the\nawkward door to the rear seat and ordered Susan to jump in.  She\nobeyed; he put the bundle on the floor beside her.  He sat with\nthe driver--the proprietor himself.  The horses set off at a\nround pace over the smooth turnpike.  It was evening, and a\nbeautiful coolness issued from the woods on either side.  They\nskimmed over the long level stretches; they climbed hills, they\nraced down into valleys.  Warham and the ragged, rawboned old\nproprietor kept up a kind of conversation--about crops and\npolitics, about the ownership, value, and fertility of the farms\nthey were passing.  Susan sat quiet, motionless most of the time.\n\nThe last daylight faded; the stars came out; the road wound in\nand out, up and down, amid cool dark silence and mysterious\nfascinating shadows.  The moon appeared above the tree tops\nstraight ahead--a big moon, with a lower arc of the rim clipped\noff.  The turnpike ended; they were making equally rapid progress\nover the dirt road which was in perfect condition as there had\nbeen no rain for several days.  The beat of the flying hoofs was\nsoft now; the two men's voices, fell into a lower key; the moon\nmarked out the line of the road clearly, made strange spectral\nminglings of light and darkness in the woods, glorified the open\nfields and gave the occasional groups of farm buildings an\nancient beauty and dignity.  The girl slept.\n\nAt nine o'clock the twenty-mile drive ended in a long, slow\nclimb up a road so washed out, so full of holes and bowlders,\nthat it was no road at all but simply a weather-beaten hillside.\nA mile of this, with the liveryman's curses--\"dod rot it\" and\n\"gosh dang it\" and similar modifications of profanity for\nChristian use and for the presence of \"the sex\"--ringing out at\nevery step.  Susan soon awakened, rather because the surrey was\npitching so wildly than because of Goslin's denunciations.  A\nbrief level stretch and they stopped for Warham to open the\nouter gate into his brother Zeke's big farm.  A quarter of a mile\nthrough wheat to the tops of the wheels and they reached the\nsecond gate.  A descent into a valley, a crossing of a creek, an\nascent of a steep hill, and they were at the third gate--between\npasture and barnyard.  Now they came into view of the house, set\nupon a slope where a spring bubbled out.  The house was white and\na white picket fence cut off its lawn from the barnyard.  A dog\nwith a deep voice began to bark.  They drove up to the front gate\nand stopped.  The dog barked in a frenzy of rage, and they heard\nhis straining and jerking at his chain.  A clump of cedars\nbrooded to the right of the house; their trunks were whitewashed\nup to the lowest branches.  The house had a high stoop with\nwooden steps.\n\nAs Warham descended and hallooed, there came a fierce tugging at\nthe front door from the inside.  But the front door was not in\nthe habit of being opened, and stoutly resisted.  The assault\ngrew more strenuous; the door gave way and a tall thin farmer\nappeared.\n\n\"Hello, Zeke,\" called George.  He opened the surrey door.  \"Get\ndown,\" he said to the girl, at the same time taking her bundle.\nHe set it on the horse block beside the gate, took out his\npocketbook and paid over the four dollars.  \"Good-by, Vic,\" said\nhe pleasantly.  \"That's a good team you've got.\"\n\n\"Not so coarse,\" said Vic.  \"Good-by, Mr. Warham.\" And off he drove.\n\nZeke Warham had now descended the steps and was opening the\nfront gate, which was evidently as unaccustomed to use as the\nfront door.  \"Howdy, George,\" said he.  \"Ain't that Susie you've\ngot with you?\" Like George, Zeke had had an elementary\neducation.  But he had married an ignorant woman, and had lived\nso long among his farm hands and tenants that he used their mode\nof speech.\n\n\"Yes, it's Susie,\" said George, shaking hands with his brother.\n\n\"Howdy, Susie,\" said Zeke, shaking hands with her.  \"I see you've\ngot your things with you.  Come to stay awhile?\"\n\nGeorge interrupted.  \"Susan, go up on the porch and take your bundle.\"\n\nThe girl took up the shawl strap and went to the front door.  She\nleaned upon the railing of the stoop and watched the two men\nstanding at the gate.  George was talking to his brother in a low\ntone.  Occasionally the brother uttered an ejaculation.  She could\nnot hear; their heads were so turned that she could not see\ntheir faces.  The moon made it almost as bright as day.  From the\npasture woods came a low, sweet chorus of night life--frogs and\ninsects and occasionally a night bird.  From the orchard to the\nleft and the clover fields beyond came a wonderful scented\nbreeze.  She heard a step in the hall; her Aunt Sallie\nappeared--a comfortable, voluble woman, a hard worker and a\nharder eater and showing it in thin hair and wrinkled face.\n\n\"Why, Susie Lenox, ain't that you?\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, Aunt,\" said Susan.\n\nHer aunt kissed her, diffusing that earthy odor which is the\nbasis of the smell of country persons.  At various hours of the\nday this odor would be modified with the smell of cow stables,\nof chickens, of cooking, according to immediate occupation.  But\nwhatever other smell there was, the earthy smell persisted.  And\nit was the smell of the house, too.\n\n\"Who's at the gate with your Uncle Zeke?\" inquired Sallie.\n\"Ain't it George?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Why don't he come in?\" She raised her voice.  \"George, ain't you\ncoming in?\"\n\n\"Howdy, Sallie,\" called George.  \"You take the girl in.  Zeke and\nI'll be along.\"\n\n\"Some business, I reckon,\" said her aunt to Susan.  \"Come on.\nHave you had supper?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan.  She was hungry now.  The splendid health of the\ngirl that had calmed her torment of soul into a dull ache was\nclamoring for food--food to enable her body to carry her strong\nand enduring through whatever might befall.\n\n\"I'll set something out for you,\" said Sallie.  \"Come right in.\nYou might leave your bundle here by the parlor door.  We'll put\nyou in the upstairs room.\"\n\nThey passed the front stairway, went back through the hall,\nthrough the big low-ceilinged living-room with its vast\nfireplace now covered for the warm season by a screen of\nflowered wallpaper.  They were in the plain old dining-room with\nits smaller fireplace and its big old-fashioned cupboards built\ninto the wall on either side of the projecting chimney-piece.\n\"There ain't much,\" resumed Sallie.  \"But I reckon you kin make out.\"\n\nOn the gayly patterned table cover she set an array of\nsubstantial plates and glasses.  From various cupboards in\ndining-room and adjoining kitchen she assembled a glass pitcher\nof sweet milk, a glass pitcher of buttermilk, a plate of cold\ncornbread, a platter of cold fried chicken, a dish of golden\nbutter, a pan of cold fried potatoes, a jar of preserved crab\napples and another of peach butter.  Susan watched with hungry\neyes.  She was thinking of nothing but food now.  Her aunt looked\nat her and smiled.\n\n\"My, but you're shootin' up!\" she exclaimed, admiring the girl's\ntall, straight figure.  \"And you don't seem to get stringy and\nbony like so many, but keep nice and round.  Do set down.\"\n\n\"I--I think I'll wait until Uncle George comes.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind!\" She pushed a wooden chair before one of\nthe two plates she had laid.  \"I see you've still got that lovely\nskin.  And how tasty you dress!  Now, do set!\"\n\nSusan seated herself.\n\n\"Pitch right in, child,\" urged Sallie.  \"How's yer aunt and her Ruth?\"\n\n\"They're--they're well, thank you.\"\n\n\"Do eat!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan.  \"I'll wait for Uncle.\"\n\n\"Never mind your manners.  I know you're starved.\" Then seeing\nthat the girl would not eat, she said, \"Well, I'll go fetch him.\"\n\nBut Susan stopped her.  \"Please please don't,\" she entreated.\n\nSallie stared to oppose; then, arrested by the intense,\nappealing expression in those violet-gray eyes, so beautifully\nshaded by dark lashes and brows, she kept silent, bustled\naimlessly about, boiling with suddenly aroused curiosity.  It was\nnearly half an hour by the big square wooden clock on the\nchimney-piece when Susan heard the steps of her two uncles.  Her\nhunger fled; the deathly sickness surged up again.  She trembled,\ngrew ghastly in the yellow lamplight.  Her hands clutched each\nother in her lap.\n\n\"Why, Susie!\" cried her aunt.  \"Whatever is the matter of you!\"\n\nThe girl lifted her eyes to her aunt's face the eyes of a\nwounded, suffering, horribly suffering animal.  She rose,\nrushed out of the door into the yard, flung herself down on the\ngrass.  But still she could not get the relief of tears.  After a\nwhile she sat up and listened.  She heard faintly the voices of\nher uncle and his relatives.  Presently her aunt came out to her.\nShe hid her face in her arm and waited for the new harshness to\nstrike.\n\n\"Get up and come in, Susie.\" The voice was kind, was\npitying--not with the pity that galls, but with the pity of one\nwho understands and feels and is also human, the pity that\nsoothes.  At least to this woman she was not outcast.\n\nThe girl flung herself down again and sobbed--poured out upon the\nbosom of our mother earth all the torrents of tears that had been\ndamming up within her.  And Sallie knelt beside her and patted\nher now and then, with a \"That's right.  Cry it out, sweetie.\"\n\nWhen tears and sobs subsided Sallie lifted her up, walked to the\nhouse with her arm round her.  \"Do you feel better?\"\n\n\"Some,\" admitted Susan.\n\n\"The men folks have went.  So we kin be comfortable.  After you've\net, you'll feel still better.\"\n\nGeorge Warham had made a notable inroad upon the food and drink.\nBut there was an abundance left.  Susan began with a hesitating\nsipping at a glass of milk and nibbling at one of the generous\ncubes of old-fashioned cornbread.  Soon she was busy.  It\ndelighted Sallie to see her eat.  She pressed the preserves, the\nchicken, the cornbread upon her.  \"I haven't eaten since early\nthis morning,\" apologized the girl.\n\n\"That means a big hole to fill,\" observed Sallie.  \"Try this buttermilk.\"\n\nBut Susan could hold no more.\n\n\"I reckon you're pretty well tired out,\" observed Sallie.\n\n\"I'll help you straighten up,\" said Susan, rising.\n\n\"No.  Let me take you up to bed--while the men's still outside.\"\n\nSusan did not insist.  They returned through the empty\nsitting-room and along the hall.  Aunt Sallie took the bundle,\nand they ascended to the spare bedroom.  Sallie showed her into\nthe front room--a damp, earthy odor; a wallpaper with countless\nreproductions of two little brown girls in a brown swing under\na brown tree; a lofty bed, white and tomb-like; some\npreposterous artificial flowers under glass on chimney-piece and\ntable; three bright chromos on the walls; \"God Bless Our Home\"\nin pink, blue and yellow worsted over the door.\n\n\"I'll run down and put the things away,\" said her aunt.  \"Then\nI'll come back.\"\n\nSusan put her bundle on the sofa, opened it, found nightgown and\ntoilet articles on top.  She looked uncertainly about, rapidly\nundressed, got into the nightgown.  \"I'll turn down the bed and\nlie on it until Auntie comes,\" she said to herself.  The bed was\ndelightfully cool; the shuck mattress made soft crackling sounds\nunder her and gave out a soothing odor of the fields.  Hardly had\nher head touched the pillow when she fell sound asleep.  In a few\nminutes her aunt came hurrying in, stopped short at sight of\nthat lovely childlike face with the lamplight full upon it.  One\nof Susan's tapering arms was flung round her dark wavy hair.\nSallie Warham smiled gently.  \"Bless the baby\" she said half\naloud.  Then her smile faded and a look of sadness and pity came.\n\"Poor child!\" she murmured.  \"The Warham men's hard.  But then all\nthe men's hard.  Poor child.\" And gently she kissed the girl's\nflushed cheek.  \"And she never had no mother, nor nothing.\" She\nsighed, gradually lowered the flame of the little old glass\nlamp, blew it out, and went noiselessly from the room, closing\nthe door behind her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nSUSAN sat up in bed suddenly, rubbing the sleep from her eyes.\nIt was broad day, and the birds were making a mighty clamor.  She\ngazed round, astonished that it was not her own room.  Then she\nremembered.  But it was as a child remembers; for when we have\nthe sense of perfect physical well-being we cannot but see our\nmisfortunes with the child's sense of unreality--and Susan had\nnot only health but youth, was still in the child stage of the\nperiod between childhood and womanhood.  She lay down again, with\nthe feeling that so long as she could stay in that comfortable\nbed, with the world shut out, just so long would all be well\nwith her.  Soon, however, the restlessness of all nature under\nthe stimulus and heat of that brilliant day communicated itself\nto her vigorous young body.  For repose and inaction are as\nforeign to healthy life as death itself, of which they are the\nsymptoms; and if ever there was an intense and vivid life, Susan\nhad it.  She got up and dressed, and leaned from the window,\nwatching the two-horse reaper in the wheat fields across the\nhollow of the pasture, and listening to its faint musical whirr.\nThe cows which had just been milked were moving sedately through\nthe gate into the pasture, where the bull, under a tree, was\nplacidly awaiting them.  A boy, in huge straw hat and a blue\ncotton shirt and linsey woolsey trousers rolled high upon his\nbrown bare legs, was escorting the herd.\n\nHer aunt in fresh, blue, checked calico came in.  \"Wouldn't you\nlike some breakfast?\" said she.  And Susan read in her manner\nthat the men were out of the way.\n\n\"No, I don't feel hungry,\" Susan replied.\n\nShe thought this was true; but when she was at the table she ate\nalmost as heartily as she had the night before.  As Susan ate she\ngazed out into the back yard of the house, where chickens of all\nsizes, colors and ages were peering and picking about.  Through\nthe fence of the kitchen garden she saw Lew, the farm hand,\ndigging potatoes.  There were ripening beans on tall poles, and\nin the farther part the forming heads of cabbages, the sprouting\nmelon vines, the beautiful fresh green of the just springing\ngarden corn.  The window through which she was looking was framed\nin morning glories and hollyhocks, and over by the garden gate\nwere on the one side a clump of elders, on the other the hardy\ngraceful stalks of gaudily spreading sunflowers.  Bees flew in\nand out, and one lighted upon the dish of honey in the comb that\nwent so well with the hot biscuit.\n\nShe rose and wandered out among the chickens, to pick up little\nfluffy youngsters one after another, and caress them, to look in\nthe henhouse itself, where several hens were sitting with the\npensive expression that accompanies the laying of eggs.  She\nthought of those other hens, less conventional, who ran away to\nlay in secret places in the weeds, to accumulate a store against\nthe time when the setting instinct should possess them.\n\nShe thought of those cannier, less docile hens and laughed.  She\nopened a gate into the barnyard, intending to go to the barn for\na look at the horses, taking in the duck pond and perhaps the\npigs on the way.  Her Uncle George's voice arrested her.\n\n\"Susan,\" he cried.  \"Come here.\"\n\nShe turned and looked wistfully at him.  The same harsh,\nunforgiving countenance--mean with anger and petty thoughts.  As\nshe moved hesitatingly toward him he said, \"You are not to go\nout of the yard.\" And he reëntered the house.  What a mysterious\ncruel world!  Could it be the same world she had lived in so\nhappily all the years until a few days ago--the same she had always\nfound \"God's beautiful world,\" full of gentleness and kindness?\n\nAnd why had it changed?  What was this sin that after a long\nsleep in her mother's grave had risen to poison everyone against\nher?  And why had it risen?  It was all beyond her.\n\nShe strolled wretchedly within bounds, with a foreboding of\nimpending evil.  She watched Lew in the garden; she got her aunt\nto let her help with the churning--drive the dasher monotonously\nup and down until the butter came; then she helped work the\nbutter, helped gather the vegetables for dinner, did everything\nand anything to keep herself from thinking.  Toward eleven\no'clock her Uncle Zeke appeared in the dining-room, called his\nwife from the kitchen.  Susan felt that at last something was to\nhappen.  After a long time her aunt returned; there were all the\nevidences of weeping in her face.\n\n\"You'd better go to your room and straighten it up,\" she said\nwithout looking at the girl.  \"The thing has aired long enough,\nI reckon. . . .  And you'd better stay up there till I call you.\"\n\nSusan had finished the room, was about to unpack the heavy-laden\nshawl strap and shake the wrinkles out of the skirts, folded\naway for two days now.  She heard the sound of a horse's hoofs,\nwent to the window.  A young man whom she recognized as one of\nher Uncle Zeke's tenants was hitching to the horse block a\nwell-set-up young mare drawing a species of broad-seated\nbreaking sulky.  He had a handsome common face, a wavy black\nmustache.  She remembered that his name was Ferguson--Jeb\nFerguson, and that he was working on shares what was known as\n\"the creek-bottom farm,\" which began about a mile and a half\naway, straight down the pasture hollow.  He glanced up at the\nwindow, raised his black slouch hat, and nodded with the\nself-conscious, self-assured grin of the desired of women.  She\ntried to return this salute with a pleasant smile.  He entered\nthe gate and she heard his boots upon the front steps.\n\nNow away across the hollow another figure appeared--a man on\nhorseback coming through the wheat fields.  He was riding toward\nthe farther gate of the pasture at a leisurely dignified pace.\nShe had only made out that he had abundant whiskers when the\nsound of a step upon the stairs caused her to turn.  As that step\ncame nearer her heart beat more and more wildly.  Her wide eyes\nfixed upon the open door of the room.  It was her Uncle George.\n\n\"Sit down,\" he said as he reached the threshold.  \"I want\nto talk to you.\"\n\nShe seated herself, with hands folded in her lap.  Her head was\naching from the beat of the blood in her temples.\n\n\"Zeke and I have talked it over,\" said Warham.  \"And we've\ndecided that the only thing to do with you is to get you\nsettled.  So in a few minutes now you're going to be married.\"\n\nHer lack of expression showed that she did not understand.  In\nfact, she could only feel--feel the cruel, contemptuous anger of\nthat voice which all her days before had caressed her.\n\n\"We've picked out a good husband for you,\" Warham continued.\n\"It's Jeb Ferguson.\"\n\nSusan quivered.  \"I--I don't want to,\" she said.\n\n\"It ain't a question of what you want,\" retorted Warham roughly.\nHe was twenty-four hours and a night's sleep away from his first\nfierce outblazing of fury--away from the influence of his wife\nand his daughter.  If it had not been for his brother Zeke,\nnarrow and cold, the event might have been different.  But Zeke\nwas there to keep his \"sense of duty\" strong.  And that he might\nnerve himself and hide and put down any tendency to be a\n\"soft-hearted fool\"--a tendency that threatened to grow as he\nlooked at the girl--the child--he assumed the roughest manner he\ncould muster.\n\n\"It ain't a question of what you want,\" he repeated.  \"It's a\nquestion of what's got to be done, to save my family and you,\ntoo--from disgrace.  We ain't going to have any more bastards in\nthis family.\"\n\nThe word meant nothing to the girl.  But the sound of it, as her\nuncle pronounced it, made her feel as though the blood were\ndrying up in her veins.\n\n\"We ain't going to take any chances,\" pursued Warham, less\nroughly; for now that he had looked the situation full and\nfrankly in the face, he had no nerve to brace himself.  The\nnecessity of what he was prepared to do and to make her do was\ntoo obvious.  \"Ferguson's here, and Zeke saw the preacher we sent\nfor riding in from the main road.  So I've come to tell you.  If\nyou'd like to fix up a little, why your Aunt Sallie'll be here\nin a minute.  You want to pray God to make you a good wife.  And\nyou ought to be thankful you have sensible relations to step in\nand save you from yourself.\"\n\nSusan tried to speak; her voice died in her throat.  She made\nanother effort.  \"I don't want to,\" she said.\n\n\"Then what do you want to do--tell me that!\" exclaimed her\nuncle, rough again.  For her manner was very moving, the more so\nbecause there was none of the usual appeal to pity and to mercy.\n\nShe was silent.\n\n\"There isn't anything else for you to do.\"\n\n\"I want to--to stay here.\"\n\n\"Do you think Zeke'd harbor you--when you're about certain to up\nand disgrace us as your mother did?\"\n\n\"I haven't done anything wrong,\" said the girl dully.\n\n\"Don't you dare lie about that!\"\n\n\"I've seen Ruth do the same with Artie Sinclair--and all the\ngirls with different boys.\"\n\n\"You miserable girl!\" cried her uncle.\n\n\"I never heard it was so dreadful to let a boy kiss you.\"\n\n\"Don't pretend to be innocent.  You know the difference between\nthat and what you did!\"\n\nSusan realized that when she had kissed Sam she had really loved\nhim.  Perhaps that was the fatal difference.  And her mother--the\nsin there had been that she really loved while the man hadn't.\nYes, it must be so.  Ruth's explanation of these mysteries had\nbeen different; but then Ruth had also admitted that she knew\nlittle about the matter--and Susan most doubted the part that\nRuth had assured her was certainly true.\n\n\"I didn't know,\" said Susan to her uncle.  \"Nobody ever told me.\nI thought we were engaged.\"\n\n\"A good woman don't need to be told,\" retorted Warham.  \"But I'm\nnot going to argue with you.  You've got to marry.\"\n\n\"I couldn't do that,\" said the girl.  \"No, I couldn't.\"\n\n\"You'll either take him or you go back to Sutherland and I'll\nhave you locked up in the jail till you can be sent to the House\nof Correction.  You can take your choice.\"\n\nSusan sat looking at her slim brown hands and interlacing her\nlong fingers.  The jail!  The House of Correction was dreadful\nenough, for though she had never seen it she had heard what it\nwas for, what kind of boys and girls lived there.  But the\njail--she had seen the jail, back behind the courthouse, with\nits air of mystery and of horror.  Not Hell itself seemed such a\nfrightful thing as that jail.\n\n\"Well--which do you choose?\" said her uncle in a sharp voice.\n\nThe girl shivered.  \"I don't care what happens to me,\" she said,\nand her voice was dull and sullen and hard.\n\n\"And it doesn't much matter,\" sneered Warham.  Every time he\nlooked at her his anger flamed again at the outrage to his love,\nhis trust, his honor, and the impending danger of more\nillegitimacy.  \"Marrying Jeb will give you a chance to reform and\nbe a good woman.  He understands--so you needn't be afraid of\nwhat he'll find out.\"\n\n\"I don't care what happens to me,\" the girl repeated in the same\nmonotonous voice.\n\nWarham rose.  \"I'll send your Aunt Sallie,\" said he.  \"And when I\ncall, she'll bring you down.\"\n\nThe girl's silence, her non-resistance the awful expression of\nher still features--made him uneasy.  He went to the window\ninstead of to the door.  He glanced furtively at her; but he\nmight have glanced openly as there wasn't the least danger of\nmeeting her eyes.  \"You're marrying about as well as you could\nhave hoped to, anyhow--better, probably,\" he observed, in an\nargumentative, defensive tone.  \"Zeke says Jeb's about the\nlikeliest young fellow he knows--a likelier fellow than either\nZeke or I was at his age.  I've given him two thousand dollars in\ncash.  That ought to start you off well.\" And he went out without\nventuring another look at her.  Her youth and helplessness, her\nstony misery, were again making it harder for him to hold\nhimself to what he and the fanatic Zeke had decided to be his\nduty as a Christian, as a father, as a guardian.  Besides, he did\nnot dare face his wife and his daughter until the whole business\nwas settled respectably and finally.\nHis sister-in-law was waiting in the next room.  As soon as his\ndescent cleared the way she hurried in.  From the threshold she\nglanced at the girl; what she saw sent her hurrying out to\nrecompose herself.  But the instant she again saw that expression\nof mute and dazed despair the tears fought for release.  The\neffort to suppress outward signs of pity made her plain fat face\ngrotesque.  She could not speak.  With a corner of her apron she\nwiped imaginary dust from the glass bells that protected the\nartificial flowers.  The poor child!  And all for no fault of\nhers--and because she had been born out of wedlock.  But then,\nthe old woman reflected, was it not one of the most familiar of\nGod's mysterious ways that people were punished most severely of\nall for the things that weren't their fault--for being born in\nshame, or in bad or low families, or sickly, or for being stupid\nor ugly or ignorant?  She envied Zeke--his unwavering belief in\nreligion.  She believed, but her tender heart was always leading\nher into doubts.\n\nShe at last got some sort of control over her voice.  \"It'll turn\nout for the best,\" she said, with her back to Susan.  \"It don't\nmake much difference nohow who a woman marries, so long as he's\nsteady and a good provider.  Jeb seems to be a nice feller.  He's\nbetter looking than your Uncle George was before he went to town\nand married a Lenox and got sleeked up.  And Jeb ain't near so\nclose as some.  That's a lot in a husband.\" And in a kind of\nhysteria, bred of fear of silence just then, she rattled on,\ntelling how this man lay awake o' nights thinking how to skin a\nflea for its hide and tallow, how that one had said only a fool\nwould pay over a quarter for a new hat for his wife----\n\n\"Will it be long?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"I'll go down and see,\" said Mrs. Warham, glad of a real excuse\nfor leaving the room.  She began to cry as soon as she was in the\nhall.  Two sparrows lit upon the window sill near Susan and\nscreamed and pecked at each other in a mock fight.  She watched\nthem; but her shiver at the faint sound of her aunt's returning\nstep far away down the stairs showed where her attention was.\nWhen Zeke's wife entered she was standing and said:\n\n\"Is it time?\"\n\n\"Come on, honey.  Now don't be afraid.\"\n\nSusan advanced with a firm step, preceded her aunt down the\nstairs.  The black slouch hat and the straw of dignified cut were\nside by side on the shiny hall table.  The parlor door was open;\nthe rarely used showroom gave forth an earthy, moldy odor like\nthat of a disturbed grave.  Its shutters, for the first time in\nperhaps a year, were open; the mud daubers that had built in the\ncrevices between shutters and sills, fancying they would never\nbe disturbed, were buzzing crossly about their ruined homes.  The\nfour men were seated, each with his legs crossed, and each\nwearing the funereal expression befitting a solemn occasion.\nSusan did not lift her eyes.  The profusely whiskered man seated\non the haircloth sofa smoothed his black alpaca coat, reset the\nblack tie deep hid by his beard, rose and advanced with a\nclerical smile whose real kindliness took somewhat from its\noffensive unction.  \"This is the young lady, is it?\" said he,\nreaching for Susan's rising but listless hand.  \"She is indeed a\n_young_ lady!\"\n\nThe two Warham men stood, shifting uneasily from leg to leg and\nrubbing their faces from time to time.  Sallie Warham was\nstanding also, her big unhealthy face twitching fantastically.\nJeb alone was seated--chair tilted back, hands in trousers\npockets, a bucolic grin of embarrassment giving an expression of\npain to his common features.  A strained silence, then Zeke\nWarham said:\n\n\"I reckon we might as well go ahead.\"\n\nThe preacher took a small black-bound book from the inside\npocket of his limp and dusty coat, cleared his throat, turned\nover the pages.  That rustling, the creaking of his collar on his\noverstarched shirt band, and the buzzing of the mud daubers\nround the windows were the only sounds.  The preacher found the\nplace, cleared his throat again.\n\n\"Mr. Ferguson----\"\n\nJeb, tall, spare, sallow, rose awkwardly.\n\n\"--You and Miss Lenox will take your places here----\" and he\nindicated a position before him.\n\nSusan was already in place; Jeb shuffled up to stand at her\nleft.  Sallie Warham hid her face in her apron.  The preacher\ncleared his throat vigorously, began--\"Dearly beloved\"--and so on\nand on.  When he put the questions to Susan and Jeb he told them\nwhat answer was expected, and they obeyed him, Jeb muttering,\nSusan with a mere, movement of the lips.  When he had finished--a\nmatter of less than three minutes--he shook hands warmly first\nwith Susan, then with Jeb.  \"Live in the fear of the Lord,\" he\nsaid.  \"That's all that's necessary.\"\n\nSallie put down her apron.  Her face was haggard and gray.  She\nkissed Susan tenderly, then led her from the room.  They went\nupstairs to the bedroom.  \"Do you want to stay to dinner?\" she\nasked in the hoarse undertone of funeral occasions.  \"Or would\nyou rather go right away?\"\n\n\"I'd rather go,\" said the girl.\n\n\"You set down and make yourself comfortable.  I'll hook up your\nshawl strap.\"\n\nSusan sat by the window, her hands in her lap.  The hand with the\nnew circlet of gold on it was uppermost.  Sallie busied herself\nwith the bundle; abruptly she threw her apron over her face,\nknelt by the bed and sobbed and uttered inarticulate moans.  The\ngirl made no sound, did not move, looked unseeingly at her inert\nhands.  A few moments and Sallie set to work again.  She soon had\nthe bundle ready, brought Susan's hat, put it on.\n\n\"It's so hot, I reckon you'll carry your jacket.  I ain't seen as\npretty a blue dress as this--yet it's plain-like, too.\" She went\nto the top of the stairs.  \"She wants to go, Jeb,\" she called\nloudly.  \"You'd better get the sulky ready.\"\n\nThe answer from below was the heavy thump of Jeb's boots on the\noilcloth covering of the hall floor.  Susan, from the window,\ndully watched the young farmer unhitch the mare and lead her up\nin front of the gate.\n\n\"Come on, honey,\" said Aunt Sallie, taking up the bundle.\n\nThe girl--she seemed a child now--followed her.  On the front\nstoop were George and his brother and the preacher.  The men made\nroom for them to pass.  Sallie opened the gate; Susan went out.\n\"You'll have to hold the bundle,\" said Sallie.  Susan mounted to\nthe seat, took the bundle on her knees.  Jeb, who had the lines,\nleft the mare's head and got up beside his bride.\n\n\"Good day, all,\" he said, nodding at the men on the stoop.  \"Good\nday, Mrs. Warham.\"\n\n\"Come and see us real soon,\" said Sallie.  Her fat chin was\nquivering; her tired-looking, washed-out eyes gazed mournfully\nat the girl who was acting and looking as if she were walking in\nher sleep.\n\n\"Good day, all,\" repeated Jeb, and again he made the clucking sound.\n\n\"Good-by and God bless you,\" said the preacher.  His nostrils were\nluxuriously sniffing the air which bore to them odors of cookery.\n\nThe mare set out.  Susan's gaze rested immovably upon the heavy\nbundle in her lap.  As the road was in wretched repair, Jeb's\nwhole attention was upon his driving.  At the gate between\nbarnyard and pasture he said, \"You hold the lines while I get down.\"\n\nSusan's fingers closed mechanically upon the strips of leather.\nJeb led the mare through the gate, closed it, resumed his seat.\nThis time the mare went on without exacting the clucking sound.\nThey were following the rocky road along the wester hillside of\nthe pasture hollow.  As they slowly made their way among the deep\nruts and bowlders, from frequent moistenings of the lips and\nthroats, noises, and twitchings of body and hands, it was\nevident that the young farmer was getting ready for\nconversation.  The struggle at last broke surface with, \"Zeke\nWarham don't waste no time road patchin'--does he?\"\n\nSusan did not answer.\n\nJeb studied her out of the corner of his eye, the first time a\nfairly good bit of roadway permitted.  He could make nothing of\nher face except that it was about the prettiest he had ever\nseen.  Plainly she was not eager to get acquainted; still,\nacquainted they must get.  So he tried again:\n\n\"My sister Keziah--she keeps house for me--she'll be mighty\nsurprised when I turn up with a wife.  I didn't let on to her\nwhat I was about, nary a word.\"\n\nHe laughed and looked expectantly at the girl.  Her expression\nwas unchanged.  Jeb again devoted himself to his driving.\n\n\"No, I didn't let on,\" he presently resumed.  \"Fact is, I wan't\nsure myself till I seed you at the winder.\" He smiled\nflirtatiously at her.  \"Then I decided to go ahead.  I dunno, but\nI somehow kinder allow you and me'll hit it off purty\nwell--don't you?\"\n\nSusan tried to speak.  She found that she could not--that she had\nnothing to say.\n\n\"You're the kind of a girl I always had my mind set on,\" pursued\nJeb, who was an expert love-maker.  \"I like a smooth skin and\npouty lips that looks as if they wanted to be kissed.\" He took\nthe reins in one hand, put his arm round her, clumsily found her\nlips with his.  She shrank slightly, then submitted.  But Jeb\nsomehow felt no inclination to kiss her again.  After a moment he\nlet his arm drop away from her waist and took the reins in both\nhands with an elaborate pretense that the bad road compelled it.\n\nA long silence, then he tried again:  \"It's cool and nice under\nthese here trees, ain't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\n\"I ain't saw you out here for several years now.  How long has it been?\"\n\n\"Three summers ago.\"\n\n\"You must 'a' growed some.  I don't seem to recollect you.  You\nlike the country?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Sho!  You're just sayin' that.  You want to live in town.  Well,\nso do I.  And as soon as I get things settled a little I'm goin'\nto take what I've got and the two thousand from your Uncle\nGeorge and open up a livery stable in town.\"\n\nSusan's strange eyes turned upon him.  \"In Sutherland?\" she asked\nbreathlessly.\n\n\"Right in Sutherland,\" replied he complacently.  \"I think I'll\nbuy Jake Antle's place in Jefferson Street.\"\n\nSusan was blanched and trembling.  \"Oh, no,\" she cried.  \"You\nmustn't do that!\"\n\nJeb laughed.  \"You see if I don't.  And we'll live in style, and\nyou can keep a gal and stay dolled up all the time.  Oh, I know\nhow to treat you.\"\n\n\"I want to stay in the country,\" cried Susan.  \"I hate Sutherland.\"\n\n\"Now, don't you be afraid,\" soothed Jeb.  \"When people see you've\ngot a husband and money they'll not be down on you no more.\nThey'll forget all about your maw--and they won't know nothin'\nabout the other thing.  You treat me right and I'll treat you\nright.  I'm not one to rake up the past.  There ain't arry bit of\nmeanness about me!\"\n\n\"But you'll let me stay here in the country?\" pleaded Susan.  Her\nimagination was torturing her with pictures of herself in\nSutherland and the people craning and whispering and mocking.\n\n\"You go where I go,\" replied Jeb.  \"A woman's place is with her\nman.  And I'll knock anybody down that looks cockeyed at you.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" murmured Susan, sinking back against the support.\n\n\"Don't you fret, Susie,\" ordered Jeb, confident and patronizing.\n\"You do what I say and everything'll be all right.  That's the\nway to get along with me and get nice clothes--do what I say.\nWith them that crosses me I'm mighty ugly.  But you ain't a-goin'\nto cross me. . . .  Now, about the house.  I reckon I'd better\nsend Keziah off right away.  You kin cook?\"\n\n\"A--a little,\" said Susan.\n\nJeb looked relieved.  \"Then she'd be in the way.  Two women about\nalways fights--and Keziah's got the Ferguson temper.  She's\nafraid of me, but now and then she fergits and has a tantrum.\"\nJeb looked at her with a smile and a frown.  \"Perk up a little,\"\nhe more than half ordered.  \"I don't want Keziah jeerin' at me.\"\n\nSusan made a pitiful effort to smile.  He eyed it sourly,\ngrunted, gave the mare a cut with the whip that caused her to\nleap forward in a gallop.  \"Whoa!\" he yelled.  \"Whoa--damn you!\"\nAnd he sawed cruelly at her mouth until she quieted down.  A\nturning and they were before a shallow story-and-a-half frame\nhouse which squatted like an old roadside beggar behind a\nweather-beaten picket fence.  The sagging shingle roof sloped\nabruptly; there were four little windows downstairs and two\nsmaller upstairs.  The door was in the center of the house; a\nweedy path led from its crooked step, between two patches of\nweedy grass, to the gate in the fence.\n\n\"Whoa!\" shouted Jeb, with the double purpose of stopping the\nmare and informing the house of his arrival.  Then to Susan:  \"You\ngit down and I'll drive round to the barn yonder.\" He nodded\ntoward a dilapidated clapboard structure, small and mean, set\nbetween a dirty lopsided straw heap and a manure heap.  \"Go right\nin and make yourself at home.  Tell Keziah who you air.  I'll be\nalong, soon as I unhitch and feed the mare.\"\n\nSusan was staring stupidly at the house--at her new home.\n\n\"Git down,\" he said sharply.  \"You don't act as if your hearin'\nor your manners was much to brag on.\"\n\nHe felt awkward and embarrassed with this delicately bred,\nlovely child-woman in the, to him, wonderfully fine and\nfashionable dress.  To hide his nervousness and to brave it out,\nhe took the only way he knew, the only way shy people usually\nknow--the way of gruffness.  It was not a ferocious gruffness for\na man of his kind; but it seemed so to her who had been used to\ngentleness only, until these last few days.  His grammar, his\nuntrained voice, his rough clothes, the odor of stale sweat and\nfarm labor he exhaled, made him horrible to her--though she only\nvaguely knew why she felt so wretched and why her body shrank\nfrom him.\n\nShe stepped down from the sulky, almost falling in her dizziness\nand blindness.  Jeb touched the mare with the whip and she was\nalone before the house--a sweet forlorn figure, childish,\nutterly out of place in those surroundings.  On the threshold, in\nfaded and patched calico, stood a tall gaunt woman with a family\nlikeness to Jeb.  She had thin shiny black hair, a hard brown\nskin, high cheekbones and snapping black eyes.  When her thin\nlips parted she showed on the left side of the mouth three large\nand glittering gold teeth that in the contrast made their gray,\nnot too clean neighbors seem white.\n\n\"Howdy!\" she called in a tone of hostility.\n\nSusan tried in vain to respond.  She stood gazing.\n\n\"What d'ye want?\"\n\n\"He he told me to go in,\" faltered Susan.  She had no sense of\nreality.  It was a dream--only a dream--and she would awaken in\nher own clean pretty pale-gray bedroom with Ruth gayly calling\nher to come down to breakfast.\n\n\"Who are you?\" demanded Keziah--for at a glance it was the sister.\n\n\"I'm--I'm Susan Lenox.\"\n\n\"Oh--Zeke Warham's niece.  Come right in.\" And Keziah looked as\nif she were about to bite and claw.\n\nSusan pushed open the latchless gate, went up the short path to\nthe doorstep.  \"I think I'll wait till he comes,\" she said.\n\n\"No.  Come in and sit down, Miss Lenox.\" And Keziah drew a\nrush-bottomed rocking chair toward the doorway.  Susan was\nlooking at the interior.  The lower floor of the house was\ndivided into three small rooms.  This central room was obviously\nthe parlor--the calico-covered sofa, the center table, the two\ndingy chromos, and a battered cottage organ made that certain.\nOn the floor was a rag carpet; on the walls, torn and dirty\npaper, with huge weather stains marking where water had leaked\nfrom the roof down the supporting beams.  Keziah scowled at\nSusan's frank expression of repulsion for the surroundings.\nSusan seated herself on the edge of the chair, put her bundle\nbeside her.\n\n\"I allow you'll stay to dinner,\" said Keziah.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Susan.\n\n\"Then I'll go put on some more to cook.\"\n\n\"Oh, no--please don't--I couldn't eat anything--really, I\ncouldn't.\" The girl spoke hysterically.\n\nJust then Jeb came round the house and appeared in the doorway.\nHe grinned and winked at Susan, looked at his sister.  \"Well,\nKeziah,\" said he, \"what d'ye think of her?\"\n\n\"She says she's going to stay to dinner,\" observed Keziah, trying\nto maintain the veneer of manners she had put on for company.\n\nThe young man laughed loudly.  \"That's a good one--that is!\" he\ncried, nodding and winking at Susan.  \"So you ain't tole her?  Well,\nKeziah, I've been and gone and got married.  And there _she_ is.\"\n\n\"Shut up--you fool!\" said Keziah.  And she looked apologetically\nat their guest.  But the expression of Susan's face made her\ncatch her breath.  \"For the Lord's sake!\" she ejaculated.  \"She\nain't married _you!_\"\n\n\"Why not?\" demanded Jeb.  \"Ain't this a free country?  Ain't I as\ngood as anybody?\"\n\nKeziah blew out her breath in a great gust and seated herself on\nthe tattered calico cover of the sofa.  Susan grew deathly white.\nHer hands trembled.  Then she sat quiet upon the edge of the old\nrush-bottomed chair.  There was a terrible silence, broken by\nJeb's saying loudly and fiercely, \"Keziah, you go get the\ndinner.  Then you pack your duds and clear out for Uncle Bob's.\"\n\nKeziah stared at the bride, rose and went to the rear door.  \"I'm\ngoin' now,\" she answered.  \"The dinner's ready except for putting\non the table.\"\n\nThrough the flimsy partitions they heard her mounting the\nuncarpeted stairs, hustling about upon an uncarpeted floor above,\nand presently descending.  \"I'll hoof it,\" she said, reappearing\nin the doorway.  \"I'll send for my things this afternoon.\"\n\nJeb, not caring to provoke the \"Ferguson temper,\" said nothing.\n\n\"As for this here marryin',\" continued Keziah, \"I never allowed\nyou'd fall so low as to take a baby, and a bastard at that.\"\n\nShe whirled away.  Jeb flung his hat on the table, flung himself\non the sofa.  \"Well--that's settled,\" said he.  \"You kin get the\ndinner.  It's all in there.\" And he jerked his head toward the\ndoor in the partition to the left.  Susan got up, moved toward\nthe indicated door.  Jeb laughed.  \"Don't you think you might take\noff your hat and stay awhile?\" said he.\n\nShe removed her hat, put it on top of the bundle which she left\non the floor beside the rocking chair.  She went into the kitchen\ndining-room.  It was a squalid room, its ceiling and walls\nsmoke-stained from the cracked and never polished stove in the\ncorner.  The air was foul with the strong old onions stewing on\nthe stove.  In a skillet slices of pork were frying.  On the back\nof the stove stood a pan of mashed potatoes and a tin coffeepot.\nOn the stained flowered cloth which covered the table in the\nmiddle of the room had been laid coarse, cracked dishes and\ndiscolored steel knives and forks with black wooden handles.\nSusan, half fainting, dropped into a chair by one of the open\nwindows.  A multitude of fat flies from the stable were running\nand crawling everywhere, were buzzing about her head.  She was\naroused by Jeb's voice:  \"Why, what the--the damnation!  You've\nfell asleep!\"\n\nShe started up.  \"In a minute!\" she muttered, nervously.\n\nAnd somehow, with Jeb's eyes on her from the doorway, she got\nthe evil-smelling messes from the stove into table dishes from\nthe shelves and then on the table, where the flies descended\nupon them in troops of scores and hundreds.  Jeb, in his shirt\nsleeves now, sat down and fell to.  She sat opposite him, her\nhands in her lap.  He used his knife in preference to his fork,\nleaping the blade high, packing the food firmly upon it with\nfork or fingers, then thrusting it into his mouth.  He ate\nvoraciously, smacking his lips, breathing hard, now and then\neructing with frank energy and satisfaction.\n\n\"My stummick's gassy right smart this year,\" he observed after\na huge gulp of coffee.  \"Some says the heavy rains last spring\nput gas into everything, but I dunno.  Maybe it's Keziah's\ncooking.  I hope you'll do better.  Why, you ain't eatin' nothin'!\"\n\n\"I'm not hungry,\" said Susan.  Then, as he frowned suspiciously,\n\"I had a late breakfast.\"\n\nHe laughed.  \"And the marrying, too,\" he suggested with a flirtatious\nnod and wink.  \"Women's always upset by them kind of things.\"\n\nWhen he had filled himself he pushed his chair back.  \"I'll set\nwith you while you wash up,\" said he.  \"But you'd better take off\nthem Sunday duds.  You'll find some calikers that belonged to maw\nin a box under the bed in our room.\" He laughed and winked at her.\n\n\"That's the one on t'other side of the settin'-room.  Yes--that's\nour'n!\" And he winked again.\n\nThe girl, ghastly white, her great eyes staring like a\nsleepwalker's, rose and stood resting one hand on the back of\nthe chair to steady her.\n\nJeb drew a cigar from his waistcoat pocket and lighted it.\n\"Usually,\" said he, \"I take a pipe or a chaw.  But this bein' a\nweddin' day----\"\n\nHe laughed and winked again, rose, took her in his arms and\nkissed her.  She made a feeble gesture of thrusting him away.  Her\nhead reeled, her stomach turned.\n\nShe got away as soon as he would release her, crossed the\nsitting-room and entered the tiny dingy bedroom.  The windows\nwere down and the bed had not yet been made.  The odor was\nnauseating--the staleness left by a not too clean sleeper who\nabhors fresh air.  Susan saw the box under the bed, knelt to draw\nit out.  But instead she buried her face in her hands, burst into\nwild sobs.  \"Oh, God,\" she prayed, \"stop punishing me.  I didn't\nmean to do wrong--and I'm sure my mother didn't, either.  Stop,\nfor Thy Son's sake, amen.\" Now surely she would wake.  God must\nanswer that prayer.  She dared not take her palms from her eyes.\nSuddenly she felt herself caught from behind.  She gave a wild\nscream and sprang up.\n\nJeb was looking at her with eyes that filled her with a fear\nmore awful than the fear of death.  \"Don't!\" she cried.  \"Don't!\"\n\n\"Never mind, hon,\" said he in a voice that was terrible just\nbecause it was soft.  \"It's only your husband.  My, but you're\npurty!\" And he seized her.  She fought.  He crushed her.  He kissed\nher with great slobbering smacks and gnawed at the flesh of her\nneck with teeth that craved to bite.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Ferguson, for pity's sake!\" she wailed.  Then she opened\nher mouth wide as one gasping for breath where there is no air;\nand pushing at him with all her strength she vented a series of\nmaniac shrieks.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nLATE that afternoon Jeb returned to the house after several\nhours of uneasy, aimless pottering about at barn and woodshed.\nHe stumped and stamped around the kitchen, then in the\nsitting-room, finally he mustered the courage to look into the\nbedroom, from which he had slunk like a criminal three hours\nbefore.  There she lay, apparently in the same position.  Her\nwaxen color and her absolute stillness added fear to his sense\nof guilt--a guilt against which he protested, because he felt he\nhad simply done what God and man expected of him.  He stood in\nthe low doorway for some time, stood there peering and craning\nuntil his fear grew so great that he could no longer put off\nending or confirming it.\n\n\"Sleepin'?\" said he in a hoarse undertone.\n\nShe did not reply; she did not move.  He could not see that she\nwas breathing.\n\n\"It'll soon be time to git supper,\" he went on--not because he\nwas thinking of supper but because he was desperately clutching\nfor something that must draw a reply from her--if she could reply.\n\"Want me to clean up the dinner and put the supper things on?\"\n\nShe made a feeble effort to rise, sank back again.  He drew an\naudible sigh of relief; at least she was not what her color\nhad suggested.\n\nIn fact, she was morbidly conscious.  The instant she had heard\nhim at the outer door she had begun to shiver and shake, and not\nuntil he moved toward the bedroom door did she become quiet.\nThen a calm had come into her nerves and her flesh--the calm\nthat descends upon the brave when the peril actually faces.  As\nhe stood there her eyes were closed, but the smell of\nhim--beneath the earthy odor of his clothing the odor of the\nbodies of those who eat strong, coarse food--stole into her\nnostrils, into her nerves.  Her whole body sickened and\nshrank--for to her now that odor meant marriage--and she would\nnot have believed Hell contained or Heaven permitted such a\nthing as was marriage.  She understood now why the Bible always\ntalked of man as a vile creature born in sin.\n\nJeb was stealthily watching her ghastly face, her limp body.\n\"Feelin' sickish?\" he asked.\n\nA slight movement of the head in assent.\n\n\"I kin ride over to Beecamp and fetch Doc Christie.\"\n\nAnother and negative shake of the head, more determined.  The\npale lips murmured, \"No--no, thank you.\" She was not hating him.\nHe existed for her only as a symbol, in this hideous dream\ncalled life, that was coiled like a snake about her and was\nbefouling her and stinging her to death.\n\n\"Don't you bother 'bout supper,\" said he with gruff, shamefaced\ngenerosity.  \"I'll look out for myself, this onct.\"\n\nHe withdrew to the kitchen, where she heard him clattering\ndishes and pans.  Daylight waned to twilight, twilight to dusk,\nto darkness.  She did not think; she did not feel, except an\noccasional dull pang from some bodily bruise.  Her soul, her\nmind, were absolutely numb.  Suddenly a radiance beat upon her\neyes.  All in an instant, before the lifting of her eyelids, soul\nand body became exquisitely acute; for she thought it was he\ncome again, with a lamp.  She looked; it was the moon whose beams\nstruck full in at the uncurtained window and bathed her face in\ntheir mild brightness.  She closed her eyes again and presently\nfell asleep--the utter relaxed sleep of a child that is worn out\nwith pain, when nature turns gentle nurse and sets about healing\nand soothing as only nature can.  When she awoke it was with a\nscream.  No, she was not dreaming; there was an odor in the\nroom--his odor, with that of a saloon added to it.\n\nAfter cooking and eating supper he had taken the jug from its\nconcealment behind the woodbox and had proceeded to cheer his\ndrooped spirits.  The more he drank the better content he was\nwith himself, with his conduct, and the clearer became his\nconviction that the girl was simply playing woman's familiar\ngame of dainty modesty.  A proper game it was too; only a man\nmust not pay attention to it unless he wished his woman to\ndespise him.  When this conviction reached the point of action he\nput away the jug, washed the glass, ate a liberal mouthful of\nthe left-over stewed onions, as he would not for worlds have his\nbride catch him tippling.  He put out the lamp and went to the\nbedroom, chuckling to himself like a man about to play a\nparticularly clever and extremely good-humored practical joke.\nHis preparations for the night were, as always, extremely simple\nmerely a flinging off of his outer clothes and, in summer, his\nsocks.  From time to time he cast an admiring amorous glance at\nthe lovely childlike face in the full moonlight.  As he was about\nto stretch himself on the bed beside her he happened to note\nthat she was dressed as when she came.  That stylish, Sundayish\ndress was already too much mussed and wrinkled.  He leaned over to\nwake her with a kiss.  It was then that she started up with a scream.\n\n\"Oh--oh--my God!\" she exclaimed, passing her hand over her brow\nand staring at him with crazed, anguished eyes.\n\n\"It's jest me,\" said he.  \"Thought you'd want to git ready fur\nbed, like as not.\"\n\n\"No, thank you, no,\" she stammered, drawing away toward the\ninner side of the bed.  \"Please I want to be as I am.\"\n\n\"Now, don't put on, sweetness,\" he wheedled.  \"You know you're\nmarried and 'ave got to git used to it.\"\n\nHe laid his hand on her arm.  She had intended to obey, since\nthat was the law of God and man and since in all the world there\nwas no other place for her, nameless and outcast.  But at his\ntouch she clenched her teeth, cried:\n\n\"No--Mr. Ferguson--please--_please_ let me be.\"\n\n\"Now, hon,\" he pleaded, seizing her with strong gentleness.\n\"There ain't no call to be skittish.  We're married, you know.\"\n\nShe wrenched herself free.  He seized her again.  \"What's the use\nof puttin' on?  I know all about you.  You little no-name,\" he\ncursed, when her teeth sank into his hand.  For an instant, at\nthat reminder of her degradation, her indelible shame that made\nher of the low and the vile, she collapsed in weakness.  Then\nwith new and fierce strength she fought again.  When she had\nexhausted herself utterly she relaxed, fell to sobbing and\nmoaning, feebly trying to shelter her face from his gluttonous\nand odorous kisses.  And upon the scene the moon shone in all\nthat beauty which from time immemorial has filled the hearts of\nlovers with ecstasy and of devotees with prayer.\n\n\nThey lay quietly side by side; he fell into a profound sleep.  He\nwas full upon his back, his broad chest heaving in the gray\ncotton undershirt, his mouth wide open with its upper fringe of\nhair in disarray and agitated by his breath.  Soon he began to\nsnore, a deafening clamor that set some loose object in the dark\npart of the room to vibrating with a tapping sound.  Susan\nstealthily raised herself upon her elbow, looked at him.  There\nwas neither horror nor fear in her haggard face but only\neagerness to be sure he would not awaken.  She, inch by inch,\nmore softly than a cat, climbed over the low footboard, was\nstanding on the floor.  One silent step at a time, with eyes\nnever from his face so clear in the moonlight, she made her way\ntoward the door.  The snoring stopped--and her heart stopped with\nit.  He gasped, gurgled, gave a snort, and sat up.\n\n\"What--which----\" he ejaculated.  Then he saw her near the door.\n\"Hello--whar ye goin'?\"\n\n\"I thought I'd undress,\" she lied, calmly and smoothly.\n\n\"Oh--that's right.\" And he lay down.\n\nShe stood in the darkness, making now and then a faint sound\nsuggestive of undressing.  The snoring began again--soft, then\ndeep, then the steady, uproarious intake with the fierce\nwhistling exhalation.  She went into the sitting-room, felt round\nin the darkness, swift and noiseless.  On the sofa she found her\nbundle, tore it open.  By feeling alone she snatched her sailor\nhat, a few handkerchiefs, two stockings, a collar her fingers\nchanced upon and a toothbrush.  She darted to the front door, was\noutside, was gliding down the path, out through the gate into\nthe road.\n\nTo the left would be the way she had come.  She ran to the right,\nwith never a backward glance--ran with all the speed in her\nlithe young body, ran with all the energy of her fear and horror\nand resolve to die rather than be taken.  For a few hundred yards\nthe road lay between open fields.  But after that it entered a\nwood.  And in that dimness she felt the first beginnings of a\nsense of freedom.  Half a mile and open fields again, with a\nsmall house on the right, a road southeastward on the left.  That\nwould be away from her Uncle Zeke's and also away from\nSutherland, which lay twenty miles to the southwest.  When she\nwould be followed Jeb would not think of this direction until he\nhad exhausted the other two.\n\nShe walked, she ran, she rested; she walked and ran and walked\nagain.  The moon ascended to the zenith, crossed the levels of\nthe upper sky, went down in the west; a long bar of dusky gray\noutlined a cloud low upon the horizon in the northeast.  She was\non the verge of collapse.  Her skin, the inside of her mouth,\nwere hot and dry.  She had to walk along at snail's pace or her\nheart would begin to beat as if it were about to burst and the\nblood would choke up into the veins of her throat to suffocate\nher.  A terrible pain came in her side--came and went--came and\nstayed.  She had passed turning after turning, to the right, to\nthe left--crossroads leading away in all directions.  She had\nkept to the main road because she did not wish to lose time,\nperhaps return upon her path, in the confusion of the darkness.\nNow she began to look about her at the country.  It was still the\nhills as round Zeke Warham's--the hills of southeastern Indiana.\nBut they were steeper and higher, for she was moving toward the\nriver.  There was less open ground, more and denser undergrowth\nand forest.  She felt that she was in a wilderness, was safe.\nNight still lay too thick upon the landscape for her to\ndistinguish anything but outlines.  She sat down on the ruined\nand crumbling panel of a zigzag fence to rest and to wait for\nlight.  She listened; a profound hush.  She was alone, all alone.\nHow far had she come?  She could not guess; but she knew that she\nhad done well.  She would have been amazed if she had known how\nwell.  All the years of her life, thanks to Mrs. Warham's good\nsense about health, she had been steadily adding to the vitality\nand strength that were hers by inheritance.  Thus, the response\nto this first demand upon them had been almost inevitable.  It\naugured well for the future, if the future should draw her into\nhardships.  She knew she had gone far and in what was left of the\nnight and with what was left of her strength she would put such\na distance between her and them that they would never believe\nshe had got so far, even should they seek in this direction.  She\nwas supporting her head upon her hands, her elbows upon her\nknees.  Her eyes closed, her head nodded; she fought against the\nimpulse, but she slept.\n\nWhen she straightened up with a start it was broad day.  The\nbirds must have finished their morning song, for there was only\nhappy, comfortable chirping in the branches above her.  She rose\nstiffly.  Her legs, her whole body, ached; and her feet were\nburning and blistered.  But she struck out resolutely.\n\nAfter she had gone halfway down a long steep hill, she had to\nturn back because she had left her only possessions.  It was a\nweary climb, and her heart quaked with terror.  But no one\nappeared, and at last she was once more at the ruins of the\nfence panel.  There lay her sailor hat, the handkerchiefs,\nwrapped round the toothbrush, the collar--and two stockings, one\nblack, the other brown.  And where was her purse?  Not there,\ncertainly.  She glanced round in swift alarm.  No one.  Yet she had\nbeen absolutely sure she had taken her purse from the\nsitting-room table when she came upon it, feeling about in the\ndark.  She had forgotten it; she was without a cent!\n\nBut she had no time to waste in self-reproaches or forebodings.\nThough the stockings would be of no use to her, she took them\nalong because to leave them was to leave a trail.  She hastened\ndown the hill.  At the bottom ran a deep creek--without a bridge.\nThe road was now a mere cowpath which only the stoutest vehicles\nor a horseman would adventure.  To her left ran an even wilder\ntrail, following the downward course of the creek.  She turned\nout of the road, entered the trail.  She came to a place where\nthe bowlders over which the creek foamed and splashed as it\nhurried southeastward were big and numerous enough to make a\ncrossing.  She took it, went slowly on down the other bank.\n\nThere was no sign of human intrusion.  Steeply on either side\nrose a hill, strewn with huge bowlders, many of them large as\nlarge houses.  The sun filtered through the foliage to make a\nbright pattern upon the carpet of last year's leaves.  The birds\ntwittered and chirped; the creek hummed its drowsy, soothing\nmelody.  She was wretchedly weary, and Oh, so hungry!  A little\nfurther, and two of the great bowlders, tumbled down from the\nsteeps, had cut off part of the creek, had formed a pool which\ntheir seamed and pitted and fern-adorned walls hid from all\nobservation except that of the birds and the squirrels in the boughs.\n\nAt once she thought how refreshed she would be if she could\nbathe in those cool waters.  She looked round, stepped in between\nthe bowlders.  She peered out; she listened.  She was safe; she\ndrew back into her little inclosure.  There was a small dry shelf\nof rock.  She hurried off her clothes, stood a moment in the\ndelicious warmth of the sunshine, stepped into the pool.  She\nwould have liked to splash about; but she dared make no sound\nthat could be heard above the noise of the water.  Luckily the\ncreek was just there rather loud, as it was expressing its\nextreme annoyance over the stolid impudence of the interrupting\nbowlders.  While she was waiting for the sun to dry her she\nlooked at her underclothes.  She simply could not put them on as\nthey were.  She knelt at the edge of the shelf and rinsed them\nout as well as she could.  Then she spread them on the thick\ntufts of overhanging fern where the hot sun would get full swing\nat them.  The brown stocking of the two mismates she had brought\nalong almost matched the pair she was wearing.  As there was a\nhole in the toe of one of them, she discarded it, and so had one\nfresh stocking.  She dried her feet thoroughly with the stocking\nshe was discarding.  Then she put her corsets and her dress\ndirectly upon her body.  She could not afford to wait until the\nunderclothes dried; she would carry them until she found for\nherself a more remote and better hiding place where she could\nawait nightfall.  She stuffed the stocking with the hole deep\ninto a cleft in the rock and laid a small stone upon it so that\nit was concealed.  Here where there were no traces, no reminders\nof the human race which had cast her out and pursued her with\ntorture of body and soul, here in the wilderness her spirits\nwere going up, and her young eyes were looking hopefully round\nand forward.  The up-piling horrors of those two days and their\nhideous climax seemed a dream which the sun had scattered.\nHopefully!  That blessed inexperience and sheer imagination of\nyouth enabling it to hope in a large, vague way when to hope for\nany definite and real thing would be impossible.\n\nShe cleaned her tan low shoes with branches of fern and grass,\nput them on.  It is impossible to account for the peculiarities\nof physical vanity.  Probably no one was ever born who had not\nphysical vanity of some kind; Susan's was her feet and ankles.\nNot her eyes, nor her hair, nor her contour, nor her skin, nor\nher figure, though any or all of these might well have been her\npleasure.  Of them she never thought in the way of pride or\nvanity.  But of her feet and ankles she was both proud and\nvain--in a reserved, wholly unobtrusive way, be it said, so\nquietly that she had passed unsuspected.  There was reason for\nthis shy, secret self-satisfaction, so amusing in one otherwise\nself-unconscious.  Her feet were beautifully formed and the\ncurves of her instep and ankle were beautiful.  She gave more\nattention now to the look of her shoes and of her stockings than\nto all the rest of this difficult woodland toilet.  She then put\non the sailor hat, fastened the collar to her garter, slipped\nthe handkerchiefs into the legs of her stockings.  Carrying her\nunderclothes, ready to roll them into a ball should she meet\nanyone, she resumed her journey into that rocky wilderness.  She\nwas sore, she had pains that were the memories of the worst\nhorrors of her hideous dream, but up in her strong, healthy\nbody, up through her strong young soul, surged joy of freedom\nand joy of hope.  Compared with what her lot had been until such\na few brief days before, this lot of friendless wanderer in the\nwilderness was dark indeed.  But she was comparing it with the\nmonstrous dream from which it was the awakening.  She was almost\nhappy--and madly hungry.\n\nAn enormous bowlder, high above her and firmly fixed in the\nspine of the hill, invited as a place where she could see\nwithout being seen, could hide securely until darkness came\nagain.  She climbed to the base of it, found that she might reach\nthe top by stepping from ledge to ledge with the aid of the\ntrees growing so close around it that some of their boughs\nseemed rooted in its weather-dented cliffs.  She dragged herself\nupward the fifty or sixty feet, glad of the difficulties because\nthey would make any pursuer feel certain she had not gone that\nway.  After perhaps an hour she came upon a flat surface where\nsoil had formed, where grass and wild flowers and several little\ntrees gave shade and a place to sleep.  And from her eyrie she\ncommanded a vast sweep of country--hills and valleys, fields,\ncreeks, here and there lonely farmhouses, and far away to the\neast the glint of the river!\n\nTo the river!  That was her destination.  And somehow it would be\nkind, would take her where she would never, never dream those\nfrightful dreams again!\n\nShe went to the side of the bowlder opposite that which she had\nclimbed.  She drew back hastily, ready to cry with vexation.  It\nwas not nearly so high or so steep; and on the slope of the hill\na short distance away was set a little farmhouse, with smoke\ncurling up from its rough stone chimney.  She dropped to all\nfours in the tall grass and moved cautiously toward the edge.\nFlat upon her breast, she worked her way to the edge and looked\ndown.  A faintly lined path led from the house through a gate in\na zigzag fence and up to the base of her fortress.  The rock had\nso crumbled on that side that a sort of path extended clear up\nto the top.  But her alarm quieted somewhat when she noted how\nthe path was grass-grown.\n\nAs nearly as she could judge it was about five o'clock.  So that\nsmoke meant breakfast!  Her eyes fixed hungrily upon the thin\ncolumn of violet vapor mounting straight into the still morning\nair.  When smoke rose in that fashion, she remembered, it was\nsure sign of clear weather.  And then the thought came, \"What if\nit had been raining!\" She simply could not have got away.\n\nAs she interestedly watched the little house and its yard she\nsaw hurrying through the burdock and dog fennel toward the base\nof her rock a determined looking hen.  Susan laughed silently, it\nwas so obvious that the hen was on a pressing and secret\nbusiness errand.  But almost immediately her attention was\ndistracted to observing the movements of a human being she could\nobscurely make out through one of the windows just back of the\nchimney.  Soon she saw that it was a woman, cleaning up a kitchen\nafter breakfast--the early breakfast of the farmhouse in summer.\n\nWhat had they had for breakfast?  She sniffed the air.  \"I think\nI can smell ham and cornbread,\" she said aloud, and laughed,\npartly at the absurdity of her fancy, chiefly at the idea of\nsuch attractive food.  She aggravated her hunger by letting her\nimagination loose upon the glorious possibilities.  A stealthy\nfluttering brought her glance back to the point where the hen\nhad disappeared.  The hen reappeared, hastened down the path and\nthrough the weeds, and rejoined the flock in the yard with an\nair which seemed to say, \"No, indeed, I've been right here all\nthe time.\"\n\n\"Now, what was she up to?\" wondered Susan, and the answer came to\nher.  Eggs!  A nest hidden somewhere near or in the base of the rock!\n\nCould she get down to that nest without being seen from the\nhouse or from any other part of the region below?  She drew back\nfrom the edge, crawled through the grass to the place where the\npath, if path it could be called, reached the top.  She was\ndelighted to find that it made the ascent through a wide cleft\nand not along the outside.  She let herself down cautiously as\nthe footway was crumbling and rotten and slippery with grass.  At\nthe lower end of the cleft she peered out.  Trees and\nbushes--plenty of them, a thick shield between her and the\nvalleys.  She moved slowly downward; a misstep might send her\nthrough the boughs to the hillside forty feet below.  She had\ngone up and down several times before her hunger-sharpened eyes\ncaught the gleam of white through the ferns growing thickly out\nof the moist mossy cracks which everywhere seamed the wall.  She\npushed the ferns aside.  There was the nest, the length of her\nforearm into the dim seclusion of a deep hole.  She felt round,\nfound the egg that was warm.  And as she drew it out she laughed\nsoftly and said half aloud:  \"Breakfast is ready!\"\n\nNo, not quite ready.  Hooking one arm round the bough of a tree\nthat shot up from the hillside to the height of the rock and\nbeyond, she pressed her foot firmly against the protecting root\nof an ancient vine of poison ivy.  Thus ensconced, she had free\nhands; and she proceeded to remove the thin shell of the egg\npiece by piece.  She had difficulty in restraining herself until\nthe end.  At last she put the whole egg into her mouth.  And never\nhad she tasted anything so good.\n\nBut one egg was only an appetizer.  She reached in again.  She did\nnot wish to despoil the meritorious hen unnecessarily, so she\nheld the egg up in her inclosing fingers and looked through it,\nas she had often seen the cook do at home.  She was not sure, but\nthe inside seemed muddy.  She laid it to one side, tried another.\nIt was clear and she ate it as she had eaten the first.  She laid\naside the third, the fourth, and the fifth.  The sixth seemed all\nright--but was not.  Fortunately she had not been certain enough\nto feel justified in putting the whole egg into her mouth before\ntasting it.  The taste, however, was enough to make her reflect\nthat perhaps on the whole two eggs were sufficient for\nbreakfast, especially as there would be at least dinner and\nsupper before she could go further.  As she did not wish to risk\nanother descent, she continued to sort out the eggs.  She found\nfour that were, or seemed to be, all right.  The thirteen that\nlooked doubtful or worse when tested by the light she restored\nwith the greatest care.  It was an interesting illustration of\nthe rare quality of consideration which at that period of her\nlife dominated her character.\n\nShe put the four eggs in the bosom of her blouse and climbed up\nto her eyrie.  All at once she felt the delicious languor of body\nand mind which is Nature's forewarning that she is about to put\nus to sleep, whether we will or no.  She lost all anxiety about\nsafety, looked hastily around for a bed.  She found just the\nplace in a corner of the little tableland where the grass grew\ntall and thick.  She took from her bosom the four eggs--her\ndinner and supper--and put them between the roots of a tree with\na cover of broad leaves over them to keep them cool.  She pulled\ngrass to make a pillow, took off her collar and laid herself\ndown to sleep.  And that day's sun did not shine upon a prettier\nsight than this soundly and sweetly sleeping girl, with her oval\nface suffused by a gentle flush, with her rounded young\nshoulders just moving the bosom of her gray silk blouse, with\nher slim, graceful legs curled up to the edge of her carefully\nsmoothed blue serge skirt.  You would have said never a care,\nmuch less a sorrow, had shadowed her dawning life.  And that is\nwhat it means to be young--and free from the curse of self-pity,\nand ignorant of life's saddest truth, that future and past are\nnot two contrasts; one is surely bright and the other is sober,\nbut they are parts of a continuous fabric woven of the same\nthreads and into the same patterns from beginning to end.\n\nWhen she awoke, beautifully rested, her eyes clear and soft, the\nshadows which had been long toward the southwest were long,\nthough not so long, toward the southeast.  She sat up and smiled;\nit was so fine to be free!  And her woes had not in the least\nshaken that serene optimism which is youth's most delightful if\nmost dangerous possession.  She crawled through the grass to the\nedge of the rock and looked out through the screening leaves of\nthe dense undergrowth.  There was no smoke from the chimney of\nthe house.  The woman, in a blue calico, was sitting on the back\ndoorstep knitting.  Farther away, in fields here and there, a few\nmen--not a dozen in all--were at work.  From a barnyard at the\nfar edge of the western horizon came the faint sound of a steam\nthresher, and she thought she could see the men at work around\nit, but this might have been illusion.  It was a serene and\nlovely panorama of summer and country.  Last of all her eyes\nsought the glimpse of distant river.\n\nShe ate two of her four eggs, put on the underclothes which were\nnow thoroughly sun-dried, shook out and rebraided her hair.  Then\nshe cast about for some way to pass the time.\n\nShe explored the whole top of the rock, but that did not use up\nmore than fifteen minutes, as it was so small that every part\nwas visible from every other part.  However, she found a great\nmany wild flowers and gathered a huge bouquet of the audacious\ncolors of nature's gardens, so common yet so effective.  She did\na little botanizing--anything to occupy her mind and keep it\nfrom the ugly visions and fears.  But all too soon she had\nexhausted the resources of her hiding place.  She looked down\ninto the valley to the north--the valley through which she had\ncome.  She might go down there and roam; it would be something to\ndo, and her young impatience of restraint was making her so\nrestless that she felt she could not endure the confines of that\nlittle rock.  It had seemed huge; a brief experience of freedom,\na few hours between her and the night's horrors and terrors, and\nit had shrunk to a tiny prison cell.  Surely she would run no\nrisk in journeying through that trackless wilderness; she need\nnot be idle, she could hasten her destiny by following the creek\nin its lonely wanderings, which must sooner or later bring it to\nthe river.  The river!\n\nShe was about to get the two remaining eggs and abandon her\nstronghold when it occurred to her that she would do well to\ntake a last look all around.  She went back to the side of the\nrock facing the house.\n\nThe woman had suspended knitting and was gazing intently across\nthe hollow to the west, where the road from the north entered\nthe landscape.  Susan turned her eyes in that direction.  Two\nhorsemen at a gallop were moving southward.  The girl was well\nscreened, but instinctively she drew still further back behind\nthe bushes--but not so far that the two on horseback, riding so\neagerly, were out of her view.  The road dipped into the hollow.\nthe galloping horsemen disappeared with it.  Susan shifted her\ngaze to the point on the brow of the hill where the road\nreappeared.  She was quivering in every nerve.  When they came\ninto view again she would know.\n\nThe place she was watching swam before her eyes.  Suddenly the\ntwo, still at a gallop, rose upon the crest of the hill.  Jeb and\nher Uncle Zeke!  Her vision cleared, her nerve steadied.\n\nThey did not draw rein until they were at the road gate of the\nlittle house.  The woman rose, put down her knitting in the seat\nof her stiff, rush-bottomed rocker, advanced to the fence.  The\nair was still, but Susan could not hear a sound, though she\ncraned forward and strained her ears to the uttermost.  She\nshrank as if she had been struck when the three began to gaze up\nat the rock--to gaze, it seemed to her, at the very spot where\nshe was standing.  Was her screen less thick than she thought?\nHad they seen--if not her, perhaps part of her dress?\n\nWildly her heart beat as Jeb dismounted from his horse the mare\nbehind which she had made her wedding journey--and stood in the\ngateway, talking with the woman and looking toward the top of\nthe rock.  Zeke Warham turned his horse and began to ride slowly\naway.  He got as far as the brow of the hill, with Jeb still in\nthe gateway, hesitating.  Then Susan heard:\n\n\"Hold on, Mr. Warham.  I reckon you're right.\"\n\nWarham halted his horse, Jeb remounted and joined him.  As the\nwoman returned toward the back doorstep, the two men rode at a\nwalk down into the hollow.  When they reappeared it was on the\nroad by which they had come.  And the girl knew the pursuit in\nthat direction--the right direction--was over.  Trembling and\nwith a fluttering in her breast like the flapping of a bird's\nwings, she sank to the ground.  Presently she burst into a\npassion of tears.  Without knowing why, she tore off the wedding\nring which until then she had forgotten, and flung it out among\nthe treetops.  A few minutes, and she dried her eyes and stood\nup.  The two horsemen were leaving the landscape at the point at\nwhich they had entered it.  The girl would not have known, would\nhave been frightened by, her own face had she seen it as she\nwatched them go out of her sight--out of her life.  She did not\nunderstand herself, for she was at that age when one is no more\nconscious of the forces locked up within his unexplored and\nuntested character than the dynamite cartridge is of its secrets\nof power and terror.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nSHE felt free to go now.  She walked toward the place where she\nhad left the eggs.  It was on the side of the rock overlooking\nthe creek.  As she knelt to remove the leaves, she heard from far\nbelow a man's voice singing.  She leaned forward and glanced down\nat the creek.  In a moment appeared a young man with a fishing\nrod and a bag slung over his shoulder.  His gray and white striped\nflannel trousers were rolled to his knees.  His fair skin and the\nfair hair waving about his forehead were exposed by the\nflapping-brimmed straw hat set upon the back of his head.  His\nvoice, a strong and manly tenor, was sending up those steeps a\nsong she had never heard before--a song in Italian.  She had not\nseen what he looked like when she remembered herself and hastily\nfell back from view.  She dropped to the grass and crawled out\ntoward the ledge.  When she showed her face it so happened that\nhe was looking straight at her.\n\n\"Hello!\" he shouted.  \"That you, Nell?\"\n\nSusan drew back, her blood in a tumult.  From below, after a\nbrief silence, came a burst of laughter.\n\nShe waited a long time, then through a shield of bunches of\ngrass looked again.  The young man was gone.  She wished that he\nhad resumed his song, for she thought she had never heard one so\nbeautiful.  Because she did not feel safe in descending until he\nwas well out of the way, and because she was so comfortable\nlying there in the afternoon sunshine watching the birds and\nlistening to them, she continued on there, glancing now and then\nat where the creek entered and where it left her range of\nvision, to make sure that no one else should come and catch her.\nSuddenly sounded a voice from somewhere behind her:\n\n\"Hey, Nell!  I'm coming!\"\n\nShe sprang to her feet, faced about; and Crusoe was not more\nagitated when he saw the print of the naked foot on his island's\nstrand.  The straw hat with the flapping brim was just lifting\nabove the edge of the rock at the opposite side, where the path\nwas.  She could not escape; the shelf offered no hiding place.\nNow the young man was stepping to the level, panting loudly.\n\n\"Gee, what a climb for a hot day!\" he cried.  \"Where are you?\"\n\nWith that he was looking at Susan, less than twenty yards away\nand drawn up defiantly.  He stared, took off his hat.  He had\nclose-cropped wavy hair and eyes as gray as Susan's own, but it\nwas a blue-gray instead of violet.  His skin was fair, too, and\nhis expression intelligent and sympathetic.  In spite of his hat,\nand his blue cotton shirt, and trousers rolled high on bare\nsunburned legs, there was nothing of the yokel about him.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he exclaimed half humorously.  \"I thought it\nwas my cousin Nell.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan, disarmed by his courtesy and by the frank\nengaging manner of it.\n\n\"I didn't mean to intrude.\" He showed white teeth in a broad\nsmile.  \"I see from your face that this is your private domain.\"\n\n\"Oh, no--not at all,\" stammered Susan.\n\n\"Yes, I insist,\" replied he.  \"Will you let me stay and rest a\nminute?  I ran round the rock and climbed pretty fast.\"\n\n\"Yes--do,\" said Susan.\n\nThe young man sat on the grass near where he had appeared, and\ncrossed his long legs.  The girl, much embarrassed, looked\nuneasily about.  \"Perhaps you'd sit, too?\" suggested he, after\neyeing her in a friendly way that could not cause offense and\nsomehow did not cause any great uneasiness.\n\nSusan hesitated, went to the shadow of a little tree not far\nfrom him.  He was fanning his flushed face with his hat.  The\ncollar of his shirt was open; below, where the tan ended\nabruptly, his skin was beautifully white.  Now that she had been\ndiscovered, it was as well to be pleasant, she reasoned.  \"It's\na fine day,\" she observed with a grown-up gravity that much\namused him.\n\n\"Not for fishing,\" said he.  \"I caught nothing.  You are a\nstranger in these parts?\"\n\nSusan colored and a look of terror flitted into her eyes.  \"Yes,\"\nshe admitted.  \"I'm--I'm passing through.\"\n\nThe young man had all he could do to conceal his amusement.\nSusan flushed deeply again, not because she saw his expression,\nfor she was not looking at him, but because her remark seemed to\nher absurd and likely to rouse suspicion.\n\n\"I suppose you came up here to see the view,\" said the man.  He\nglanced round.  \"It _is_ pretty good.  You're not visiting down\nBrooksburg way, by any chance?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Susan, rather composedly and determined to change\nthe subject.  \"What was that song I heard you singing?\"\n\n\"Oh--you heard, did you?\" laughed he.  \"It's the Duke's song from\n'Rigoletto.'\"\n\n\"That's an opera, isn't it--like 'Trovatore'?\"\n\n\"Yes--an Italian opera.  Same author.\"\n\n\"It's a beautiful song.\" It was evident that she longed to ask\nhim to sing it.  She felt at ease with him; he was so unaffected\nand simple, was one of those people who seem to be at home\nwherever they are.\n\n\"Do you sing?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Not really,\" replied she.\n\n\"Neither do I.  So if you'll sing to me, I'll sing to you.\"\n\nSusan looked round in alarm.  \"Oh, dear, no--please don't,\" she cried.\n\n\"Why not?\" he asked curiously.  \"There isn't a soul about.\"\n\n\"I know--but--really, you mustn't.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said he, seeing that her nervousness was not at all\nfrom being asked to sing.  They sat quietly, she gazing off at\nthe horizon, he fanning himself and studying her lovely young\nface.  He was somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty-five and a\nclose observer would have suspected him of an unusual amount of\nexperience, even for a good-looking, expansive youth of that age.\n\nHe broke the long silence.  \"I'm a newspaper man from Cincinnati.\nI'm on the _Commercial_ there.  My name's Roderick Spenser.  My\nfather's Clayton Spenser, down at Brooksburg\"--he pointed to the\nsoutheast--\"beyond that hill there, on the river.  I'm here on my\nvacation.\" And he halted, looking at her expectantly.\n\nIt seemed to her that there was in courtesy no escape without a\nreturn biographical sketch.  She hung her head, twisted her\ntapering fingers in her lap, and looked childishly embarrassed\nand unhappy.  Another long silence; again he broke it.  \"You'll\npardon my saying so, but--you're very young, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Not so--so _terribly_ young.  I'm almost seventeen,\" replied she,\nglancing this way and that, as if thinking of flight.\n\n\"You look like a child, yet you don't,\" he went on, and his\nfrank, honest voice calmed her.  \"You've had some painful\nexperience, I'd say.\"\n\nShe nodded, her eyes down.\n\nA pause, then he:  \"Honest, now--aren't you--running away?\"\n\nShe lifted her eyes to his piteously.  \"Please don't ask me,\" she said.\n\n\"I shouldn't think of it,\" replied he, with a gentleness in his\npersistence that made her feel still more like trusting him, \"if\nit wasn't that----\n\n\"Well, this world isn't the easiest sort of a place.  Lots of\nrough stretches in the road.  I've struck several and I've always\nbeen glad when somebody has given me a lift.  And I want to pass\nit on--if you'll let me.  It's something we owe each other--don't\nyou think?\"\n\nThe words were fine enough; but it was the voice in which he\nsaid them that went to her heart.  She covered her face with her\nhands and released her pent emotions.  He took a package of\ntobacco and a sheaf of papers from his trousers pocket, rolled\nand lighted a cigarette.  After a while she dried her eyes,\nlooked at him shamefacedly.  But he was all understanding and\nsympathy.\n\n\"Now you feel better, don't you?\"\n\n\"Much,\" said she.  And she laughed.  \"I guess I'm more upset than\nI let myself realize.\"\n\n\"Sorry you left home?\"\n\n\"I haven't any home,\" answered she simply.  \"And I wouldn't go\nback alive to the place I came from.\"\n\nThere was a quality in the energy she put into her words that\nmade him thoughtful.  He counseled with the end of his cigarette.\nFinally he inquired:\n\n\"Where are you bound for?\"\n\n\"I don't know exactly,\" confessed she, as if it were a small matter.\n\nHe shook his head.  \"I see you haven't the faintest notion what\nyou're up against.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll get along.  I'm strong, and I can learn.\"\n\nHe looked at her critically and rather sadly.\n\n\"Yes--you are strong,\" said he.  \"But I wonder if you're strong enough.\"\n\n\"I never was sick in my life.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that. . . .  I'm not sure I know just what I do mean.\"\n\n\"Is it very hard to get to Chicago?\" inquired she.\n\n\"It's easier to get to Cincinnati.\"\n\nShe shook her head positively.  \"It wouldn't do for me to go there.\"\n\n\"Oh, you come from Cincinnati?\"\n\n\"No--but I--I've been there.\"\n\n\"Oh, they caught you and brought you back?\"\n\nShe nodded.  This young man must be very smart to understand so quickly.\n\n\"How much money have you got?\" he asked abruptly.\n\nBut his fear that she would think him impertinent came of an\nunderestimate of her innocence.  \"I haven't got any,\" replied\nshe.  \"I forgot my purse.  It had thirty dollars in it.\"\n\nAt once he recognized the absolute child; only utter\ninexperience of the world could speak of so small a sum so\nrespectfully.  \"I don't understand at all,\" said he.  \"How long\nhave you been here?\"\n\n\"All day.  I got here early this morning.\"\n\n\"And you haven't had anything to eat!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!  I found some eggs.  I've got two left.\"\n\nTwo eggs--and no money and no friends--and a woman.  Yet she was\nfacing the future hopefully!  He smiled, with tears in his eyes.\n\n\"You mustn't tell anybody you saw me,\" she went on.  \"No matter\nwhat they say, don't think you ought to tell on me.\"\n\nHe looked at her, she at him.  When he had satisfied himself he\nsmiled most reassuringly.  \"I'll not,\" was his answer, and now\nshe _knew_ she could trust him.\n\nShe drew a breath of relief, and went on as if talking with an\nold friend.  \"I've got to get a long ways from here.  As soon as\nit's dark I'm going.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Toward the river.\" And her eyes lit.\n\n\"The river?  What's there?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said she triumphantly.\n\nBut he understood.  He had the spirit of adventure himself--one\ncould see it at a glance--the spirit that instinctively shuns\nyesterday and all its works and wings eagerly into tomorrow,\nunknown, different, new--therefore better.  But this girl, this\nchild-woman--or was she rather woman-child?--penniless, with\nnothing but two eggs between her and starvation, alone, without\nplans, without experience--\n\nWhat would become of her?. . .  \"Aren't you--afraid?\" he asked.\n\n\"Of what?\" she inquired calmly.\n\nIt was the mere unconscious audacity of ignorance, yet he saw in\nher now--not fancied he saw, but saw--a certain strength of\nsoul, both courage and tenacity.  No, she might suffer, sink--but\nshe would die fighting, and she would not be afraid.  And he\nadmired and envied her.\n\n\"Oh, I'll get along somehow,\" she assured him in the same\nself-reliant tone.  Suddenly she felt it would no longer give her\nthe horrors to speak of what she had been through.  \"I'm not very\nold,\" said she, and hers was the face of a woman now.  \"But I've\nlearned a great deal.\"\n\n\"You are sure you are not making a mistake in--in--running away?\"\n\n\"I couldn't do anything else,\" replied she.  \"I'm all alone in\nthe world.  There's no one--except----\n\n\"I hadn't done anything, and they said I had disgraced them--and\nthey----\"  Her voice faltered, her eyes sank, the color flooded\ninto her face.  \"They gave me to a man--and he--I had hardly seen\nhim before--he----\" She tried but could not pronounce the\ndreadful word.\n\n\"Married, you mean?\" said the young man gently.\n\nThe girl shuddered.  \"Yes,\" she answered.  \"And I ran away.\"\n\nSo strange, so startling, so moving was the expression of her\nface that he could not speak for a moment.  A chill crept over\nhim as he watched her wide eyes gazing into vacancy.  What vision\nof horror was she seeing, he wondered.  To rouse her he spoke the\nfirst words he could assemble:\n\n\"When was this?\"\n\nThe vision seemed slowly to fade and she looked at him in\nastonishment.  \"Why, it was last night!\" she said, as if dazed by\nthe discovery.  \"Only last night!\"\n\n\"Last night!  Then you haven't got far.\"\n\n\"No.  But I must.  I will.  And I'm not afraid of anything except\nof being taken back.\"\n\n\"But you don't realize what may be--probably is--waiting for\nyou--at the river--and beyond.\"\n\n\"Nothing could be so bad,\" said she.  The words were nothing, but\nthe tone and the expression that accompanied them somehow\nconvinced him beyond a doubt.\n\n\"You'll let me help you?\"\n\nShe debated.  \"You might bring me something to eat--mightn't you?\nThe eggs'll do for supper.  But there's tomorrow.  I don't want to\nbe seen till I get a long ways off.\"\n\nHe rose at once.  \"Yes, I'll bring you something to eat.\" He took\na knockabout watch from the breast pocket of his shirt.  \"It's\nnow four o'clock.  I've got three miles to walk.  I'll ride back\nand hitch the horse down the creek--a little ways down, so it\nwon't attract attention to your place up here.  I'll be back in\nabout an hour and a half. . . .  Maybe I'll think of something\nthat'll help.  Can I bring you anything else?\n\n\"No.  That is--I'd like a little piece of soap.\"\n\n\"And a towel?\" he suggested.\n\n\"I could take care of a towel,\" agreed she.  \"I'll send it back\nto you when I get settled.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" He laughed at her simplicity.  \"What an honest\nchild you are!\" He put out his hand, and she took it with\ncharming friendliness.  \"Good-by.  I'll hurry.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad you caught me,\" said she.  Then, apologetically, \"I\ndon't want to be any trouble.  I hate to be troublesome.  I've\nnever let anybody wait on me.\"\n\n\"I don't know when I've had as much pleasure as this is giving\nme.\" And he made a bow that hid its seriousness behind a smile\nof good-humored raillery.\n\nShe watched him descend with a sinking heart.  The rock--the\nworld--her life, seemed empty now.  He had reminded her that\nthere were human beings with good hearts.  But--perhaps if he\nknew, his kindness would turn also. . . .  No, she decided not.\nMen like him, women like Aunt Sallie--they did not believe\nthose dreadful, wicked ideas that people said God had ordained.\nStill--if he knew about her birth--branded outcast--he might\nchange.  She must not really hope for anything much until she was\nfar, far away in a wholly new world where there would be a\nwholly new sort of people, of a kind she had never met.  But she\nwas sure they would welcome her, and give her a chance.\n\nShe returned to the tree against which she had been sitting, for\nthere she could look at the place his big frame had pressed down\nin the tall grass, and could see him in it, and could recall his\nfriendly eyes and voice, and could keep herself assured she had\nnot been dreaming.  He was a citified man, like Sam--but how\ndifferent!  A man with a heart like his would never marry a\nwoman--no, never!  He couldn't be a brute like that.  Still,\nperhaps nice men married because it was supposed to be the\nright thing to do, and was the only way to have children without\npeople thinking you a disgrace and slighting the children--and\nthen marrying made brutes of them.  No wonder her uncles could\ntreat her so.  They were men who had married.\n\nAfar off she heard the manly voice singing the song from\n\"Rigoletto.\" She sprang up and listened, with eyes softly\nshining and head a little on one side.  The song ended; her heart\nbeat fast.  It was not many minutes before she, watching at the\nend of the path, saw him appear at the bottom of the huge cleft.\nAnd the look in his eyes, the merry smile about his expressive\nmouth, delighted her.  \"I'm so glad to see you!\" she cried.\n\nOver his shoulder was flung his fishing bag, and it bulged.\n\"Don't be scared by the size of my pack,\" he called up, as he\nclimbed.  \"We're going to have supper together--if you'll let me\nstay.  Then you can take as much or as little as you like of\nwhat's left.\"\n\nArrived at the top, he halted for a long breath.  They stood\nfacing each other.  \"My, what a tall girl you are for your age!\"\nsaid he admiringly.\n\nShe laughed up at him.  \"I'll be as tall as you when I get my growth.\"\n\nShe was so lovely that he could scarcely refrain from telling\nher so.  It seemed to him, however, it would be taking an unfair\nadvantage to say that sort of thing when she was in a way at his\nmercy.  \"Where shall we spread the table?\" said he.  \"I'm hungry\nas the horseleech's daughter.  And you--why, you must be starved.\nI'm afraid I didn't bring what you like.  But I did the best I\ncould.  I raided the pantry, took everything that was portable.\"\n\nHe had set down the bag and had loosened its strings.  First he\ntook out a tablecloth.  She laughed.  \"Gracious!  How stylish we\nshall be!\"\n\n\"I didn't bring napkins.  We can use the corners of the cloth.\"\nHe had two knives, two forks, and a big spoon rolled up in the\ncloth, and a saltcellar.  \"Now, here's my triumph!\" he cried,\ndrawing from the bag a pair of roasted chickens.  Next came a jar\nof quince jelly; next, a paper bag with cold potatoes and cold\nstring beans in it.  Then he fished out a huge square of\ncornbread and a loaf of salt-rising bread, a pound of butter--\n\n\"What will your folks say?\" exclaimed she, in dismay.\n\nHe laughed.  \"They always have thought I was crazy, ever since I\nwent to college and then to the city instead of farming.\" And\nout of the bag came a big glass jar of milk.  \"I forgot to bring\na glass!\" he apologized.  Then he suspended unpacking to open the\njar.  \"Why, you must be half-dead with thirst, up here all day\nwith not a drop of water.\" And he held out the jar to her.\n\"Drink hearty!\" he cried.\n\nThe milk was rich and cold; she drank nearly a fourth of it\nbefore she could wrest the jar away from her lips.  \"My, but that\nwas good!\" she remarked.  He had enjoyed watching her drink.\n\"Surely you haven't got anything else in that bag?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" replied he.  \"Here's a towel, wrapped round the soap.\nAnd here are three cakes of chocolate.  You could live four or\nfive days on them, if you were put to it.  So whatever else you\nleave, don't leave them.  And--Oh, yes, here's a calico slip and\na sunbonnet, and a paper of pins.  And that's all.\"\n\n\"What are they for?\"\n\n\"I thought you might put them on--the slip over your dress--and\nyou wouldn't look quite so--so out of place--if anybody should\nsee you.\"\n\n\"What a fine idea!\" cried Susan, shaking out the slip delightedly.\n\nHe was spreading the supper on the tablecloth.  He carved one of\nthe chickens, opened the jelly, placed the bread and vegetables\nand butter.  \"Now!\" he cried.  \"Let's get busy.\"\n\nAnd he set her an example she was not slow to follow.  The sun\nhad slipped down behind the hills of the northwest horizon.  The\nbirds were tuning for their evening song.  A breeze sprang up and\ncoquetted with the strays of her wavy dark hair.  And they sat\ncross-legged on the grass on opposite sides of the tablecloth\nand joked and laughed and ate, and ate and laughed and joked\nuntil the stars began to appear in the vast paling opal of the\nsky.  They had chosen the center of the grassy platform for their\nbanquet; thus, from where they sat only the tops of trees and\nthe sky were to be seen.  And after they had finished she leaned\non her elbow and listened while he, smoking his cigarette, told\nher of his life as a newspaper man in Cincinnati.  The twilight\nfaded into dusk, the dusk into a scarlet darkness.\n\n\"When the moon comes up we'll start,\" said he.  \"You can ride\nbehind me on the horse part of the way, anyhow.\"\n\nThe shadow of the parting, the ending of this happiness, fell\nupon her.  How lonely it would be when he was gone!  \"I haven't\ntold you my name,\" she said.\n\n\"I've told you mine Roderick Spenser--with an _s_, not a _c_.\"\n\n\"I remember,\" said she.  \"I'll never forget. . . .  Mine's Susan Lenox.\"\n\n\"What was it--before----\"  He halted.\n\n\"Before what?\" His silence set her to thinking.  \"Oh!\" she\nexclaimed, in a tone that made him curse his stupidity in\nreminding her.  \"My name's Susan Lenox--and always will be.  It\nwas my mother's name.\" She hesitated, decided for frankness at\nany cost, for his kindness forbade her to deceive him in any\nway.  Proudly, \"My mother never let any man marry her.  They say\nshe was disgraced, but I understand now.  _She_ wouldn't stoop to\nlet any man marry her.\"\n\nSpenser puzzled over this, but could make nothing of it.  He felt\nthat he ought not to inquire further.  He saw her anxious eyes,\nher expression of one keyed up and waiting for a verdict.  \"I'd\nhave only to look at you to know your mother was a fine woman,\"\nsaid he.  Then, to escape from the neighborhood of the dangerous\nriddle, \"Now, about your--your going,\" he began.  \"I've been\nthinking what to do.\"\n\n\"You'll help me?\" said she, to dispel her last doubt--a very\nfaint doubt, for his words and his way of uttering them had\ndispelled her real anxiety.\n\n\"Help you?\" cried he heartily.  \"All I can.  I've got a scheme to\npropose to you.  You say you can't take the mail boat?\"\n\n\"They know me.  I--I'm from Sutherland.\"\n\n\"You trust me--don't you?\"\n\n\"Indeed I do.\"\n\n\"Now listen to me--as if I were your brother.  Will you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I'm going to take you to Cincinnati with me.  I'm going to put\nyou in my boarding house as my sister.  And I'm going to get you\na position.  Then--you can start in for yourself.\"\n\n\"But that'll be a great lot of trouble, won't it?\"\n\n\"Not any more than friends of mine took for me when I was\nstarting out.\" Then, as she continued silent, \"What are you\nthinking?  I can't see your face in this starlight.\"\n\n\"I was thinking how good you are,\" she said simply.\n\nHe laughed uneasily.  \"I'm not often accused of that,\" he\nreplied.  \"I'm like most people--a mixture of good and bad--and\nnot very strong either way.  I'm afraid I'm mostly impulse that\nwinks out.  But--the question is, how to get you to Cincinnati.\nIt's simply impossible for me to go tonight.  I can't take you\nhome for the night.  I don't trust my people.  They'd not think I\nwas good--or you, either.  And while usually they'd be\nright--both ways--this is an exception.\" This idea of an\nexception seemed to amuse him.  He went on, \"I don't dare leave you\nat any farmhouse in the neighborhood.  If I did, you could be traced.\"\n\n\"No--no,\" she cried, alarmed at the very suggestion.  \"I mustn't\nbe seen by anybody.\"\n\n\"We'll go straight to the river, and I'll get a boat and row you\nacross to Kentucky--over to Carrollton.  There's a little hotel.\nI can leave you----\"\n\n\"No--not Carrollton,\" she interrupted.  \"My uncle sells goods\nthere, and they know him.  And if anything is in the Sutherland\npapers about me, why, they'd know.\"\n\n\"Not with you in that slip and sunbonnet.  I'll make up a\nstory--about our wagon breaking down and that I've got to walk\nback into the hills to get another before we can go on.\nAnd--it's the only plan that's at all possible.\"\n\nObviously he was right; but she would not consent.  By adroit\nquestioning he found that her objection was dislike of being so\nmuch trouble to him.  \"That's too ridiculous,\" cried he.  \"Why, I\nwouldn't have missed this adventure for anything in the world.\"\n\nHis manner was convincing enough, but she did not give in until\nmoonrise came without her having thought of any other plan.  He\nwas to be Bob Peters, she his sister Kate, and they were to hail\nfrom a farm in the Kentucky hills back of Milton.  They practiced\nthe dialect of the region and found that they could talk it well\nenough to pass the test of a few sentences They packed the\nfishing bag; she wrapped the two eggs in paper and put them in\nthe empty milk bottle.  They descended by the path--a slow\njourney in the darkness of that side of the rock, as there were\nmany dangers, including the danger of making a noise that might\nbe heard by some restless person at the house.  After half an\nhour they were safely at the base of the rock; they skirted it,\nwent down to the creek, found the horse tied where he had left\nit.  With her seated sideways behind him and holding on by an arm\nhalf round his waist, they made a merry but not very speedy\nadvance toward the river, keeping as nearly due south as the\nbreaks in the hills permitted.  After a while he asked:  \"Do you\never think of the stage?\"\n\n\"I've never seen a real stage play,\" said she.  \"But I want\nto--and I will, the first chance I get.\"\n\n\"I meant, did you ever think of going on the stage?\"\n\n\"No.\" So daring a flight would have been impossible for a baby\nimagination in the cage of the respectable-family-in-a-small-town.\n\n\"It's one of my dreams to write plays,\" he went on.  \"Wouldn't it\nbe queer if some day I wrote plays for you to act in?\"\n\nWhen one's fancy is as free as was Susan's then, it takes any\ndirection chance may suggest.  Susan's fancy instantly winged\nalong this fascinating route.  \"I've given recitations at school,\nand in the plays we used to have they let me take the best\nparts--that is--until--until a year or so ago.\"\n\nHe noted the hesitation, had an instinct against asking why\nthere had come a time when she no longer got good parts.  \"I'm\nsure you could learn to act,\" declared he.  \"And you'll be sure\nof it, too, after you've seen the people who do it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't believe I could,\" said she, in rebuke to her own\nmounting self-confidence.  Then, suddenly remembering her\nbirth-brand of shame and overwhelmed by it, \"No, I can't hope to\nbe to be anything much.  They wouldn't have--_me_.\"\n\n\"I know how you feel,\" replied he, all unaware of the real\nreason for this deep humility.  \"When I first struck town I felt\nthat way.  It seemed to me I couldn't hope ever to line up with\nthe clever people they had there.  But I soon saw there was\nnothing in that idea.  The fact is, everywhere in the world\nthere's a lot more things to do than people who can do them.\nMost of those who get to the top--where did they start?  Where\nwe're starting.\"\n\nShe was immensely flattered by that \"we\" and grateful for it.\nBut she held to her original opinion.  \"There wouldn't be a\nchance for me,\" said she.  \"They wouldn't have me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I understand,\" said he and he fancied he did.  He laughed\ngayly at the idea that in the theater anyone would care who she\nwas--what kind of past she had had--or present either, for that\nmatter.  Said he, \"You needn't worry.  On the stage they don't ask\nany questions--any questions except 'Can you act?  Can you get it\nover?  Can you get the hand?'\"\n\nThen this stage, it was the world she had dreamed of--the world\nwhere there lived a wholly new kind of people--people who could\nmake room for her.  She thrilled, and her heart beat wildly.  In\na strangely quiet, intense voice, she said:\n\n\"I want to try.  I'm sure I'll get along there.  I'll work--Oh, so\nhard.  I'll do _anything!_\"\n\n\"That's the talk,\" cried he.  \"You've got the stuff in you.\"\n\nShe said little the rest of the journey.  Her mind was busy with\nthe idea he had by merest accident given her.  If he could have\nlooked in upon her thoughts, he would have been amazed and not\na little alarmed by the ferment he had set up.\n\nWhere they reached the river the bank was mud and thick willows,\nthe haunt of incredible armies of mosquitoes.  \"It's a mystery to\nme,\" cried he, \"why these fiends live in lonely places far away\nfrom blood, when they're so mad about it.\" After some searching\nhe found a clear stretch of sandy gravel where she would be not\ntoo uncomfortable while he was gone for a boat.  He left the\nhorse with her and walked upstream in the direction of\nBrooksburg.  As he had warned her that he might be gone a long\ntime, he knew she would not be alarmed for him--and she had\nalready proved that timidity about herself was not in her nature.\nBut he was alarmed for her--this girl alone in that lonely\ndarkness--with light enough to make her visible to any prowler.\n\nAbout an hour after he left her he returned in a rowboat he had\nborrowed at the water mill.  He hitched the horse in the deep\nshadow of the break in the bank.  She got into the boat, put on\nthe slip and the sunbonnet, put her sailor hat in the bag.  They\npushed off and he began the long hard row across and upstream.\nThe moon was high now and was still near enough to its full\nglory to pour a flood of beautiful light upon the broad\nriver--the lovely Ohio at its loveliest part.\n\n\"Won't you sing?\" he asked.\n\nAnd without hesitation she began one of the simple familiar love\nsongs that were all the music to which the Sutherland girls had\naccess.  She sang softly, in a deep sweet voice, sweeter even\nthan her speaking voice.  She had the sunbonnet in her lap; the\nmoon shone full upon her face.  And it seemed to him that he was\nin a dream; there was nowhere a suggestion of reality--not of\nits prose, not even of its poetry.  Only in the land no waking\neye has seen could such a thing be.  The low sweet voice sang of\nlove, the oars clicked rhythmically in the locks and clove the\nwater with musical splash; the river, between its steep hills,\nshone in the moonlight, with a breeze like a friendly spirit\nmoving upon its surface.  He urged her, and she sang another\nsong, and another.  She sighed when she saw the red lantern on\nthe Carrollton wharf; and he, turning his head and seeing,\nechoed her sigh.\n\n\"The first chance, you must sing me that song,\" she said.\n\n\"From 'Rigoletto'?  I will.  But--it tells how fickle women\nare--'like a feather in the wind.'. . .  They aren't all like\nthat, though--don't you think so?\"\n\n\"Sometimes I think everybody's like a feather in the wind,\"\nreplied she.  \"About love--and everything.\"\n\nHe laughed.  \"Except those people who are where there isn't any wind.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nFOR some time Spenser had been rowing well in toward the\nKentucky shore, to avoid the swift current of the Kentucky River\nwhich rushes into the Ohio at Carrollton.  A few yards below its\nmouth, in the quiet stretch of backwater along shore, lay the\nwharf-boat, little more than a landing stage.  The hotel was but\na hundred feet away, at the top of the steep levee.  It was\nmidnight, so everyone in the village had long been asleep.  After\nseveral minutes of thunderous hammering Roderick succeeded in\ndrawing to the door a barefooted man with a candle in his huge,\nknotted hand--a man of great stature, amazingly lean and long of\nleg, with a monstrous head thatched and fronted with coarse,\nyellow-brown hair.  He had on a dirty cotton shirt and dirty\ncotton trousers--a night dress that served equally well for the\nday.  His feet were flat and thick and were hideous with corns\nand bunions.  Susan had early been made a critical observer of\nfeet by the unusual symmetry of her own.  She had seen few feet\nthat were fit to be seen; but never, she thought, had she seen\nan exhibition so repellent.\n\n\"What t'hell----\" he began.  Then, discovering Susan, he growled,\n\"Beg pardon, miss.\"\n\nRoderick explained--that is, told the prearranged story.  The man\npointed to a grimy register on the office desk, and Roderick set\ndown the fishing bag and wrote in a cramped, scrawly hand, \"Kate\nPeters, Milton, Ky.\"\n\nThe man looked at it through his screen of hair and beard, said,\n\"Come on, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Just a minute,\" said Roderick, and he drew \"Kate\" aside and said\nto her in a low tone:  \"I'll be back sometime tomorrow, and then\nwe'll start at once.  But--to provide against everything--don't be\nalarmed if I don't come.  You'll know I couldn't help it.  And wait.\"\n\nSusan nodded, looking at him with trustful, grateful eyes.\n\n\"And,\" he went on hurriedly, \"I'll leave this with you, to take\ncare of.  It's yours as much as mine.\"\n\nShe saw that it was a pocketbook, instinctively put her hands\nbehind her.\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" he said, with good-humored impatience.  \"You'll\nprobably not need it.  If you do, you'll need it bad.  And you'll\npay me back when you get your place.\"\n\nHe caught one of her hands and put the pocketbook in it.  As his\nargument was unanswerable, she did not resist further.  She\nuttered not a word of thanks, but simply looked at him, her eyes\nswimming and about her mouth a quiver that meant a great deal in\nher.  Impulsively and with flaming cheek he kissed her on the\ncheek.  \"So long, sis,\" he said loudly, and strode into the night.\n\nSusan did not flush; she paled.  She gazed after him with some\nsuch expression as a man lost in a cave might have as he watches\nthe flickering out of his only light.  \"This way, ma'am,\" said\nthe hotel man sourly, taking up the fishing bag.  She started,\nfollowed him up the noisy stairs to a plain, neat country\nbedroom.  \"The price of this here's one fifty a day,\" said he.\n\"We've got 'em as low as a dollar.\"\n\n\"I'll take a dollar one, please,\" said Susan.\n\nThe man hesitated.  \"Well,\" he finally snarled, \"business is\nslack jes' now.  Seein' as you're a lady, you kin have this here\nun fur a dollar.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you--but if the price is more----\"\n\n\"The other rooms ain't fit fur a lady,\" said the hotel man.  Then\nhe grinned a very human humorous grin that straightway made him\nmuch less repulsive.  \"Anyhow, them two durn boys of mine an'\ntheir cousins is asleep in 'em.  I'd as lief rout out a nest of\nhornets.  I'll leave you the candle.\"\n\nAs soon as he had gone Susan put out the light, ran to the\nwindow.  She saw the rowboat and Spenser, a black spot far out on\nthe river, almost gone from view to the southwest.  Hastily she\nlighted the candle again, stood at the window and waved a white\ncover she snatched from the table.  She thought she saw one of\nthe oars go up and flourish, but she could not be sure.  She\nwatched until the boat vanished in the darkness at the bend.  She\nfound the soap in the bag and took a slow but thorough bath in\nthe washbowl.  Then she unbraided her hair, combed it out as well\nas she could with her fingers, rubbed it thoroughly with a towel\nand braided it again.  She put on the calico slip as a\nnightdress, knelt down to say her prayers.  But instead of\nprayers there came flooding into her mind memories of where she\nhad been last night, of the horrors, of the agonies of body and\nsoul.  She rose from her knees, put out the light, stood again at\nthe window.  In after years she always looked back upon that hour\nas the one that definitely marked the end of girlhood, of the\nthoughts and beliefs which go with the sheltered life, and the\nbeginning of womanhood, of self-reliance and of the\nhardiness--so near akin to hardness--the hardiness that must\ncome into the character before a man or a woman is fit to give\nand take in the combat of life.\n\nThe bed was coarse, but white and clean.  She fell asleep\ninstantly and did not awaken until, after the vague, gradually\nlouder sound of hammering on the door, she heard a female voice\nwarning her that breakfast was \"put nigh over an' done.\" She got\nup, partly drew on one stocking, then without taking it off\ntumbled over against the pillow and was asleep.  When she came to\nherself again, the lay of the shadows told her it must be after\ntwelve o'clock.  She dressed, packed her serge suit in the bag\nwith the sailor hat, smoothed out the pink calico slip and put\nit on.  For more than a year she had worn her hair in a braid\ndoubled upon itself and tied with a bow at the back of her neck.\nShe decided that if she would part it, plait it in two braids\nand bring them round her head, she would look older.  She tried\nthis and was much pleased with the result.  She thought the new\nstyle not only more grown-up, but also more becoming.  The pink\nslip, too, seemed to her a success.  It came almost to her ankles\nand its strings enabled her to make it look something like a\ndress.  Carrying the pink sunbonnet, down she went in search of\nsomething to eat.\n\nThe hall was full of smoke and its air seemed greasy with the\nodor of frying.  She found that dinner was about to be served.  A\ngirl in blue calico skirt and food-smeared, sweat-discolored\nblue jersey ushered her to one of the tables in the dining-room.\n\"There's a gentleman comin',\" said she.  \"I'll set him down with\nyou.  He won't bite, I don't reckon, and there ain't no use\nmussin' up two tables.\"\n\nThere was no protesting against two such arguments; so Susan\npresently had opposite her a fattish man with long oily hair and\na face like that of a fallen and dissipated preacher.  She\nrecognized him at once as one of those wanderers who visit small\ntowns with cheap shows or selling patent medicines and doing\njuggling tricks on the street corners in the flare of a gasoline\nlamp.  She eyed him furtively until he caught her at it--he being\nabout the same business himself.  Thereafter she kept her eyes\nsteadily upon the tablecloth, patched and worn thin with much\nwashing.  Soon the plate of each was encircled by the familiar\narc of side dishes containing assorted and not very appetizing\nmesses--fried steak, watery peas, stringy beans, soggy turnips,\nlumpy mashed potatoes, a perilous-looking chicken stew,\ncornbread with streaks of baking soda in it.  But neither of the\ndiners was critical, and the dinner was eaten with an enthusiasm\nwhich the best rarely inspires.\n\nWith the prunes and dried-apple pie, the stranger expanded.\n\"Warm day, miss,\" he ventured.\n\n\"Yes, it is a little warm,\" said Susan.  She ventured a direct\nlook at him.  Above the pleasant, kindly eyes there was a brow so\nunusually well shaped that it arrested even her young and\nuntrained attention.  Whatever the man's character or station,\nthere could be no question as to his intelligence.\n\n\"The flies are very bothersome,\" continued he.  \"But nothing like\nAustralia.  There the flies have to be picked off, and they're\nbig, and they bite--take a piece right out of you.  The natives\nused to laugh at us when we were in the ring and would try to\nbrush, em away.\" The stranger had the pleasant, easy manner of\none who through custom of all kinds of people and all varieties\nof fortune, has learned to be patient and good-humored--to take\nthe day and the hour as the seasoned gambler takes the cards\nthat are dealt him.\n\nSusan said nothing; but she had listened politely.  The man went\non amusing himself with his own conversation.  \"I was in the show\nbusiness then.  Clown was my line, but I was rotten at it--simply\nrotten.  I'm still in the show business--different line, though.\nI've got a show of my own.  If you're going to be in town perhaps\nyou'll come to see us tonight.  Our boat's anchored down next to the\nwharf.  You can see it from the windows.  Come, and bring your folks.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Susan--she had for gotten her role and its\naccent.  \"But I'm afraid we'll not be here.\"\n\nThere was an expression in the stranger's face--a puzzled,\ncurious expression, not impertinent, rather covert--an\nexpression that made her uneasy.  It warned her that this man saw\nshe was not what she seemed to be, that he was trying to peer\ninto her secret.  His brown eyes were kind enough, but alarmingly\nkeen.  With only half her pie eaten, she excused herself and\nhastened to her room.\n\nAt the threshold she remembered the pocketbook Spenser had given\nher.  She had left it by the fishing bag on the table.  There was\nthe bag but not the pocketbook.  \"I must have put it in the bag,\"\nshe said aloud, and the sound and the tone of her voice\nfrightened her.  She searched the bag, then the room which had\nnot yet been straightened up.  She shook out the bed covers,\nlooked in all the drawers, under the bed, went over the contents\nof the bag again.  The pocketbook was gone--stolen.\n\nShe sat down on the edge of the bed, her hands in her lap, and\nstared at the place where she had last seen the pocketbook--_his_\npocketbook, which he had asked her to take care of.  How could\nshe face him!  What would he think of her, so untrustworthy!  What\na return for his kindness!  She felt weak--so weak that she lay\ndown.  The food she had taken turned to poison and her head ached\nfiercely.  What could she do?  To speak to the proprietor would be\nto cause a great commotion, to attract attention to herself--and\nhow would that help to bring back the stolen pocketbook, taken\nperhaps by the proprietor himself?  She recalled that as she\nhurried through the office from the dining-room he had a queer\nshifting expression, gave her a wheedling, cringing good morning\nnot at all in keeping with the character he had shown the night\nbefore.  The slovenly girl came to do the room; Susan sent her\naway, sat by the window gazing out over the river and\ndownstream.  He would soon be here; the thought made her long to\nfly and hide.  He had been all generosity; and this was her way\nof appreciating it!\n\nThey sent for her to come down to supper.  She refused, saying\nshe was not feeling well.  She searched the room, the bag, again\nand again.  She would rest a few minutes, then up she would\nspring and tear everything out.  Then back to the window to sit\nand stare at the river over which the evening shadows were\nbeginning to gather.  Once, as she was sitting there, she\nhappened to see the gaudily painted and decorated show boat.  A\nman--the stranger of the dinner table--was standing on the\nforward end, smoking a cigar.  She saw that he was observing her,\nrealized he could have seen her stirring feverishly about her\nroom.  A woman came out of the cabin and joined him.  As soon as\nhis attention was distracted she closed her shutters.  And there\nshe sat alone, with the hours dragging their wretched minutes\nslowly away.\n\nThat was one of those nights upon which anyone who has had\nthem--and who has not?--looks back with wonder at how they ever\nlived, how they ever came to an end.  She slept a little toward\ndawn--for youth and health will not let the most despairing\nheart suffer in sleeplessness.  Her headache went, but the misery\nof soul which had been a maddening pain settled down into a\nthrobbing ache.  She feared he would come; she feared he would\nnot come.  The servants tried to persuade her to take breakfast.\nShe could not have swallowed food; she would not have dared take\nfood for which she could not pay.  What would they do with her if\nhe did not come?  She searched the room again, hoping against\nhope, a hundred times fancying she felt the purse under some\nother things, each time suffering sickening disappointment.\n\nToward noon the servant came knocking.  \"A letter for you, ma'am.\"\n\nSusan rushed to the door, seized the letter, tore it open, read:\n\n\nWhen I got back to the horse and started to mount, he kicked me\nand broke my leg.  You can go on south to the L. and N. and take\na train to Cincinnati.  When you find a boarding house send your\naddress to me at the office.  I'll come in a few weeks.  I'd write\nmore but I can't.  Don't worry.  Everything'll come out right.  You\nare brave and sensible, and I _back you to win_.\n\n\nWith the unsigned letter crumpled in her hands she sat at the\nwindow with scarcely a motion until noon.  She then went down to\nthe show boat.  Several people--men and women--were on the\nforward end, quarreling.  She looked only at her acquaintance.\nHis face was swollen and his eyes bloodshot, but he still wore\nthe air of easy and patient good-humor.  She said, standing on\nthe shore, \"Could I speak to you a minute?\"\n\n\"Certainly, ma'am,\" replies he, lifting his dingy straw hat with\ngaudy, stained band.  He came down the broad plank to the shore.\n\"Why, what's the matter?\" This in a sympathetic tone.\n\n\"Will you lend me two dollars and take me along to work it out?\"\nshe asked.\n\nHe eyed her keenly.  \"For the hotel bill?\" he inquired, the cigar\ntucked away in the corner of his mouth.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"He didn't show up?\"\n\n\"He broke his leg.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" The tone was politely sympathetic, but incredulous.  He eyed\nher critically, thoughtfully.  \"Can you sing?\" he finally asked.\n\n\"A little.\"\n\nHis hands were deep in the pockets of his baggy light trousers.\nHe drew one of them out with a two-dollar bill in it.  \"Go and\npay him and bring your things.  We're about to push off.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the girl in the same stolid way.  She returned\nto the hotel, brought the bag down from her room, stood at the\noffice desk.\n\nThe servant came.  \"Mr. Gumpus has jes' stepped out,\" said she.\n\n\"Here is the money for my room.\" And Susan laid the two-dollar\nbill on the register.\n\n\"Ain't you goin' to wait fur yer--yer brother?\"\n\n\"He's not coming,\" replied the girl.  \"So--I'll go.  Good-by.\"\n\n\"Good-by.  It's awful, bein' took sick away from home.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Susan.  \"Good-by.\"\n\nThe girl's homely, ignorant face twisted in a grin.  But Susan\ndid not see, would have been indifferent had she seen.  Since she\naccepted the war earth and heaven had declared against her, she\nhad ceased from the little thought she had once given to what\nwas thought of her by those of whom she thought not at all.  She\nwent down to the show boat.  The plank had been taken in.  Her\nacquaintance was waiting for her, helped her to the deck, jumped\naboard himself, and was instantly busy helping to guide the boat\nout into mid-stream.  Susan looked back at the hotel.  Mr. Gumpus\nwas in the doorway, amusement in every line of his ugly face.\nBeside him stood the slovenly servant.  She was crying--the more\nhuman second thought of a heart not altogether corrupted by the\nsordid hardness of her lot.  How can faith in the human race\nfalter when one considers how much heart it has in spite of all\nit suffers in the struggle upward through the dense fogs of\nignorance upward, toward the truth, toward the light of which it\nnever ceases to dream and to hope?\n\n\nSusan stood in the same place, with her bag beside her, until\nher acquaintance came.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, comfortably, as he lighted a fresh cigar, \"we'll\nfloat pleasantly along.  I guess you and I had better get\nacquainted.  What is your name?\"\n\nSusan flushed.  \"Kate Peters is the name I gave at the hotel.\nThat'll do, won't it?\"\n\n\"Never in the world!\" replied he.  \"You must have a good catchy\nname.  Say--er--er----\"  He rolled his cigar slowly, looking\nthoughtfully toward the willows thick and green along the\nIndiana shore.  \"Say--well, say--Lorna--Lorna--Lorna Sackville!\nThat's a winner.  Lorna Sackville!--A stroke of genius!  Don't you\nthink so?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan.  \"It doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"But it does,\" remonstrated he.  \"You are an artist, now, and an\nartist's name should always arouse pleasing and romantic\nanticipations.  It's like the odor that heralds the dish.  You\nmust remember, my dear, that you have stepped out of the world\nof dull reality into the world of ideals, of dreams.\"\n\nThe sound of two harsh voices, one male, the other female, came\nfrom within the cabin--oaths, reproaches.  Her acquaintance\nlaughed.  \"That's one on me--eh?  Still, what I say is true--or at\nleast ought to be.  By the way, this is the Burlingham Floating\nPalace of Thespians, floating temple to the histrionic art.  I am\nBurlingham--Robert Burlingham.\" He smiled, extended his hand.\n\"Glad to meet you, Miss Lorna Sackville--don't forget!\"\n\nShe could not but reflect a smile so genuine, so good-humored.\n\n\"We'll go in and meet the others--your fellow stars--for this is\nan all-star aggregation.\"\n\nOver the broad entrance to the cabin was a chintz curtain strung\nupon a wire.  Burlingham drew this aside.  Susan was looking into\na room about thirty feet long, about twelve feet wide, and a\nscant six feet high.  Across it with an aisle between were narrow\nwooden benches with backs.  At the opposite end was a stage, with\nthe curtain up and a portable stove occupying the center.  At the\nstove a woman in a chemise and underskirt, with slippers on her\nbare feet, was toiling over several pots and pans with fork and\nspoon.  At the edge of the stage, with legs swinging, sat another\nwoman, in a blue sailor suit neither fresh nor notably clean but\nsomehow coquettish.  Two men in flannel shirts were seated, one\non each of the front benches, with their backs to her.\n\nAs Burlingham went down the aisle ahead of her, he called out:\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to present the latest valuable\naddition to our company--Miss Lorna Sackville, the renowned\nballad singer.\"\n\nThe two men turned lazily and stared at Susan, each with an arm\nhanging over the back of the bench.\n\nBurlingham looked at the woman bent over the stove--a fat,\nmiddle-aged woman with thin, taffy-yellow hair done sleekly over\na big rat in front and made into a huge coil behind with the aid\nof one or more false braids.  She had a fat face, a broad expanse\nof unpleasant-looking, elderly bosom, big, shapeless white arms.\nHer contour was almost gone.  Her teeth were a curious mixture of\nnatural, gold, and porcelain.  \"Miss Anstruther--Miss Sackville,\"\ncalled Burlingham.  \"Miss Sackville, Miss Violet Anstruther.\"\n\nMiss Anstruther and Susan exchanged bows--Susan's timid and\nfrightened, Miss Anstruther's accompanied by a hostile stare and\na hardening of the fat, decaying face.\n\n\"Miss Connemora--Miss Sackville.\" Burlingham was looking at the\nyounger woman--she who sat on the edge of the little stage.  She,\ntoo, was a blond, but her hair had taken to the chemical\nsomewhat less reluctantly than had Miss Anstruther's, with the\nresult that Miss Connemora's looked golden.  Her face--of the\nbaby type must have been softly pretty at one time--not so very\ndistant.  Now lines were coming and the hard look that is\ninevitable with dyed hair.  Also her once fine teeth were rapidly\ngoing off, as half a dozen gold fillings in front proclaimed.  At\nSusan's appealing look and smile Miss Connemora nodded not\nunfriendly.\n\n\"Good God, Bob,\" said she to Burlingham with a laugh, \"are you\ngoing to get the bunch of us pinched for child-stealing?\"\n\nBurlingham started to laugh, suddenly checked himself, looked\nuneasily and keenly at Susan.  \"Oh, it's all right,\" he said with\na wave of the hand.  But his tone belied his words.  He puffed\ntwice at his cigar, then introduced the men--Elbert Eshwell and\nGregory Tempest--two of the kind clearly if inelegantly placed\nby the phrase, \"greasy hamfats.\" Mr. Eshwell's black-dyed hair\nwas smoothly brushed down from a central part, Mr. Tempest's\niron-gray hair was greasily wild--a disarray of romantic\nringlets.  Eshwell was inclined to fat; Tempest was gaunt and had\nthe hollow, burning eye that bespeaks the sentimental ass.\n\n\"Now, Miss Sackville,\" said Burlingham, \"we'll go on the forward\ndeck and canvass the situation.  What for dinner, Vi?\"\n\n\"Same old rot,\" retorted Miss Anstruther, wiping the sweat from\nher face and shoulders with a towel that served also as a\ndishcloth.  \"Pork and beans--potatoes--peach pie.\"\n\n\"Cheer up,\" said Burlingham.  \"After tomorrow we'll do better.\"\n\n\"That's been the cry ever since we started,\" snapped Violet.\n\n\"For God's sake, shut up, Vi,\" groaned Eshwell.  \"You're always kicking.\"\n\nThe cabin was not quite the full width of the broad house boat.\nAlong the outside, between each wall and the edge, there was\nroom for one person to pass from forward deck to rear.  From the\ncabin roof, over the rear deck, into the water extended a big\nrudder oar.  When Susan, following Burlingham, reached the rear\ndeck, she saw the man at this oar--a fat, amiable-looking\nrascal, in linsey woolsey and a blue checked shirt open over his\nchest and revealing a mat of curly gray hair.  Burlingham hailed\nhim as Pat--his only known name.  But Susan had only a glance for\nhim and no ear at all for the chaffing between him and the\nactor-manager.  She was gazing at the Indiana shore, at a tiny\nvillage snuggled among trees and ripened fields close to the\nwater's edge.  She knew it was Brooksburg.  She remembered the\nlong covered bridge which they had crossed--Spenser and she, on\nthe horse.  To the north of the town, on a knoll, stood a large\nred brick house trimmed with white veranda and balconies--far\nand away the most pretentious house in the landscape.  Before the\ndoor was a horse and buggy.  She could make out that there were\nseveral people on the front veranda, one of them a man in\nblack--the doctor, no doubt.  Sobs choked up into her throat.  She\nturned quickly away that Burlingham might not see.  And under her\nbreath she said,\n\n\"Good-by, dear.  Forgive me--forgive me.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nWOMAN'S worktable, a rocking chair and another with a swayback\nthat made it fairly comfortable for lounging gave the rear deck\nthe air of an outdoor sitting-room, which indeed it was.\nBurlingham, after a comprehensive glance at the panorama of\nsummer and fruitfulness through which they were drifting,\nsprawled himself in the swayback chair, indicating to Susan that\nshe was to face him in the rocker.  \"Sit down, my dear,\" said he.\n\"And tell me you are at least eighteen and are not running away\nfrom home.  You heard what Miss Connemora said.\"\n\n\"I'm not running away from home,\" replied Susan, blushing\nviolently because she was evading as to the more important fact.\n\n\"I don't know anything about you, and I don't want to know,\"\npursued Burlingham, alarmed by the evidences of a dangerous\ntendency to candor.  \"I've no desire to have my own past dug\ninto, and turn about's fair play.  You came to me to get an\nengagement.  I took you.  Understand?\"\n\nSusan nodded.\n\n\"You said you could sing--that is, a little.\"\n\n\"A very little,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Enough, no doubt.  That has been our weak point--lack of a\nballad singer.  Know any ballads?--Not fancy ones.  Nothing fancy!\nWe cater to the plain people, and the plain people only like the\nbest--that is, the simplest--the things that reach for the\nheartstrings with ten strong fingers.  You don't happen to know\n'I Stood on the Bridge at Midnight'?\"\n\n\"No--Ruth sings that,\" replied Susan, and colored violently.\n\nBurlingham ignored the slip.  \"'Blue Alsatian Mountains'?\"\n\n\"Yes.  But that's very old.\"\n\n\"Exactly.  Nothing is of any use to the stage until it's very\nold.  Audiences at theaters don't want to _hear_ anything they\ndon't already know by heart.  They've come to _see_, not to hear.\nSo it annoys them to have to try to hear.  Do you understand that?\"\n\n\"No,\" confessed Susan.  \"I'm sorry.  But I'll think about it, and\ntry to understand it.\" She thought she was showing her inability\nto do what was expected of her in paying back the two dollars.\n\n\"Don't bother,\" said Burlingham.  \"Pat!\"\n\n\"Yes, boss,\" said the man at the oar, without looking or\nremoving his pipe.\n\n\"Get your fiddle.\"\n\nPat tied the oar fast and went forward along the roof of the\ncabin.  While he was gone Burlingham explained, \"A frightful souse,\nPat--almost equal to Eshwell and far the superior of Tempest or\nVi--that is, of Tempest.  But he's steady enough for our purposes,\nas a rule.  He's the pilot, the orchestra, the man-of-all-work, the\nbill distributor.  Oh, he's a wonder.  Graduate of Trinity College,\nDublin--yeggman--panhandler--barrel-house bum--genius, nearly.  Has\ndrunk as much booze as there is water in this river----\"\n\nPat was back beside the handle of the oar, with a violin.\nBurlingham suggested to Susan that she'd better stand while she\nsang, \"and if you've any tendency to stage fright, remember it's\nyour bread and butter to get through well.  You'll not bother\nabout your audience.\"\n\nSusan found this thought a potent strengthener--then and\nafterward.  With surprisingly little embarrassment she stood\nbefore her good-natured, sympathetic employer, and while Pat\nscraped out an accompaniment sang the pathetic story of the\n\"maiden young and fair\" and the \"stranger in the spring\" who\n\"lingered near the fountains just to hear the maiden sing,\" and\nhow he departed after winning her love, and how \"she will never\nsee the stranger where the fountains fall again--adé, adé, adé.\"\nHer voice was deliciously young and had the pathetic quality\nthat is never absent from anything which has enduring charm for\nus.  Tears were in Burlingham's voice--tears for the fate of the\nmaiden, tears of response to the haunting pathos of Susan's sweet\ncontralto, tears of joy at the acquisition of such a \"number\"\nfor his program.  As her voice died away he beat his plump hands\ntogether enthusiastically.\n\n\"She'll do--eh, Pat?  She'll set the hay-tossers crazy!\"\n\nSusan's heart was beating fast from nervousness.  She sat down.\nBurlingham sprang up and put his hands on her shoulders and\nkissed her.  He laughed at her shrinking.\n\n\"Don't mind, my dear,\" he cried.  \"It's one of our ways.  Now,\nwhat others do you know?\"\n\nShe tried to recall, and with his assistance finally did\ndiscover that she possessed a repertoire of \"good old stale\nones,\" consisting of \"Coming Thro' the Rye,\" \"Suwanee River,\"\n\"Annie Laurie\" and \"Kathleen Mavourneen.\" She knew many other\nsongs, but either Pat could not play them or Burlingham declared\nthem \"above the head of Reub the rotter.\"\n\n\"Those five are quite enough,\" said Burlingham.  \"Two regulars,\ntwo encores, with a third in case of emergency.  After dinner\nMiss Anstruther and I'll fit you out with a costume.  You'll make\na hit at Sutherland tonight.\"\n\n\"Sutherland!\" exclaimed Susan, suddenly pale.  \"I can't sing\nthere--really, I can't.\"\n\nBurlingham made a significant gesture toward Pat at the oar\nabove them, and winked at her.  \"You'll not have stage fright, my\ndear.  You'll pull through.\"\n\nSusan understood that nothing more was to be said before Pat.\nSoon Burlingham told him to tie the oar again and retire to the\ncabin.  \"I'll stand watch,\" said he.  \"I want to talk business\nwith Miss Sackville.\"\n\nWhen Pat had gone, Burlingham gave her a sympathetic look.  \"No\nconfidences, mind you, my dear,\" he warned.  \"All I want to know\nis that it isn't stage fright that's keeping you off the program\nat Sutherland.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the girl.  \"It isn't stage fright.  I'm--I'm sorry\nI can't begin right away to earn the money to pay you back.\nBut--I can't.\"\n\n\"Not even in a velvet and spangle costume--Low neck, short\nsleeves, with blond wig and paint and powder?  You'll not know\nyourself, my dear--really.\"\n\n\"I couldn't,\" said Susan.  \"I'd not be able to open my lips.\"\n\n\"Very well.  That's settled.\" It was evident that Burlingham was\ndeeply disappointed.  \"We were going to try to make a killing at\nSutherland.\" He sighed.  \"However, let that pass.  If you can't,\nyou can't.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you're angry with me,\" cried she.\n\n\"I--angry!\" He laughed.  \"I've not been angry in ten years.  I'm\nsuch a _damn_, damn fool that with all the knocks life's given me\nI haven't learned much.  But at least I've learned not to get\nangry.  No, I understand, my dear--and will save you for the next\ntown below.\" He leaned forward and gave her hands a fatherly\npat as they lay in her lap.  \"Don't give it a second thought,\" he\nsaid.  \"We've got the whole length of the river before us.\"\n\nSusan showed her gratitude in her face better far than she could\nhave expressed it in words.  The two sat silent.  When she saw his\neyes upon her with that look of smiling wonder in them, she\nsaid, \"You mustn't think I've done anything dreadful.  I\nhaven't--really, I haven't.\"\n\nHe laughed heartily.  \"And if you had, you'd not need to hang\nyour head in this company, my dear.  We're all people who have\n_lived_--and life isn't exactly a class meeting with the elders\ntaking turns at praying and the organ wheezing out gospel hymns.\nNo, we've all been up against it most of our lives--which means\nwe've done the best we could oftener than we've had the chance\nto do what we ought.\" He gave her one of his keen looks, nodded:\n\"I like you. . . .  What do they tell oftenest when they're\ntalking about how you were as a baby?\"\n\nSusan did not puzzle over the queerness of this abrupt question.\nShe fell to searching her memory diligently for an answer.  \"I'm\nnot sure, but I think they speak oftenest of how I never used to\nlike anybody to take my hand and help me along, even when I was\nbarely able to walk.  They say I always insisted on trudging\nalong by myself.\"\n\nBurlingham nodded, slapped his knee.  \"I can believe it,\" he\ncried.  \"I always ask everybody that question to see whether I've\nsited 'em up right.  I rather think I hit you off to a T--as you\nfaced me at dinner yesterday in the hotel.  Speaking of\ndinner--let's go sit in on the one I smell.\"\n\nThey returned to the cabin where, to make a table, a board had\nbeen swung between the backs of the second and third benches\nfrom the front on the left side of the aisle.  Thus the three men\nsat on the front bench with their legs thrust through between\nseat and back, while the three women sat in dignity and comfort\non the fourth bench.  Susan thought the dinner by no means\njustified Miss Anstruther's pessimism.  It was good in itself,\nand the better for being in this happy-go-lucky way, in this\nhappy-go-lucky company.  Once they got started, all the\ngrouchiness disappeared.  Susan, young and optimistic and\ndetermined to be pleased, soon became accustomed to the looks of\nher new companions--that matter of mere exterior about which we\nshallow surface-skimmers make such a mighty fuss, though in the\ntest situations of life, great and small, it amounts to precious\nlittle.  They were all human beings, and the girl was unspoiled,\ndid not think of them as failures, half-wolves, of no social\nposition, of no standing in the respectable world.  She still had\nmuch of the natural democracy of children, and she admired these\nnew friends who knew so much more than she did, who had lived,\nhad suffered, had come away from horrible battles covered with\nwounds, the scars of which they would bear into the\ngrave--battles they had lost; yet they had not given up, but had\nlived on, smiling, courageous, kind of heart.  It was their kind\nhearts that most impressed her--their kind taking in of her whom\nthose she loved had cast out--her, the unknown stranger,\nhelpless and ignorant.  And what Spenser had told her about the\nstage and its people made her almost believe that they would not\ncast her out, though they knew the dreadful truth about her birth.\n\nTempest told a story that was \"broad.\" While the others laughed,\nSusan gazed at him with a puzzled expression.  She wished to be\npolite, to please, to enjoy.  But what that story meant she could\nnot fathom.  Miss Anstruther jeered at her.  \"Look at the\ninnocent,\" she cried.\n\n\"Shut up, Vi,\" retorted Miss Connemora.  \"It's no use for us to\ntry to be anything but what we are.  Still, let the baby alone.\"\n\n\"Yes--let her alone,\" said Burlingham.\n\n\"It'll soak in soon enough,\" Miss Connemora went on.  \"No use\nrubbing it in.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Susan, thinking to show her desire to be friendly,\nto be one of them.\n\n\"Dirt,\" said Burlingham dryly.  \"And don't ask any more questions.\"\n\nWhen the three women had cleared away the dinner and had stowed\nthe dishes in one of the many cubbyholes along the sides of the\ncabin, the three men got ready for a nap.  Susan was delighted to\nsee them drop to the tops of the backs of the seats three berths\nwhich fitted snugly into the walls when not in use.  She saw now\nthat there were five others of the same kind, and that there was\na contrivance of wires and curtains by which each berth could be\nshut off to itself.  She had a thrilling sense of being in a kind\nof Swiss Family Robinson storybook come to life.  She unpacked\nher bag, contributed the food in it to the common store, spread\nout her serge suit which Miss Anstruther offered to press and\ninsisted on pressing, though Susan protested she could do it\nherself quite well.\n\n\"You'll want to put it on for the arrival at Sutherland,\" said\nMabel Connemora.\n\n\"No,\" replied Susan nervously.  \"Not till tomorrow.\"\n\nShe saw the curious look in all their eyes at sight of that\ndress, so different from the calico she was wearing.  Mabel took\nher out on the forward deck where there was an awning and a good\nbreeze.  They sat there, Mabel talking, Susan gazing rapt at land\nand water and at the actress, and listening as to a fairy\nstory--for the actress had lived through many and strange\nexperiences in the ten years since she left her father's roof in\nColumbia, South Carolina.  Susan listened and absorbed as a dry\nsponge dropped into a pail of water.  At her leisure she would\nthink it all out, would understand, would learn.\n\n\"Now, tell _me_ about _your_self,\" said Mabel when she had\nexhausted all the reminiscences she could recall at the\nmoment--all that were fit for a \"baby's\" ears.\n\n\"I will, some time,\" said Susan, who was ready for the question.\n\"But I can't--not yet.\"\n\n\"It seems to me you're very innocent,\" said Mabel, \"even for a\nwell-brought-up girl.  _I_ was well brought up, too.  I wish to God\nmy mother had told me a few things.  But no--not a thing.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" inquired Susan.\n\nThat set the actress to probing the girl's innocence--what she\nknew and what she did not.  It had been many a day since Miss\nConnemora had had so much pleasure.  \"Well!\" she finally said.  \"I\nnever would have believed it--though I know these things are so.\nNow I'm going to teach you.  Innocence may be a good thing for\nrespectable women who are going to marry and settle down with a\ngood husband to look after them.  But it won't do at all--not at\nall, my dear!--for a woman who works--who has to meet men in\ntheir own world and on their own terms.  It's hard enough to get\nalong, if you know.  If you don't--when you're knocked down, you\nstay knocked down.\"\n\n\"Yes--I want to learn,\" said Susan eagerly.  \"I want to\nknow--_everything!_\"\n\n\"You're not going back?\" Mabel pointed toward the shore, to a\nhome on a hillside, with a woman sewing on the front steps and\nchildren racing about the yard.  \"Back to that sort of thing?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Susan.  \"I've got nothing to go back to.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" repeated Susan in the same simple, final way.  \"I'm\nan outcast.\"\n\nThe ready tears sprang to Mabel's dissipated but still bright\neyes.  Susan's unconscious pathos was so touching.  \"Then I'll\neducate you.  Now don't get horrified or scandalized at me.  When\nyou feel that way, remember that Mabel Connemora didn't make the\nworld, but God.  At least, so they say--though personally I feel\nas if the devil had charge of things, and the only god was in us\npoor human creatures fighting to be decent.  I tell you, men and\nwomen ain't bad--not so damn bad--excuse me; they will slip out.\nNo, it's the things that happen to them or what they're\nafraid'll happen--it's those things that compel them to be\nbad--and get them in the way of being bad--hard to each other,\nand to hate and to lie and to do all sorts of things.\"\n\nThe show boat drifted placidly down with the current of the\nbroad Ohio.  Now it moved toward the left bank and now toward the\nright, as the current was deflected by the bends--the beautiful\ncurves that divided the river into a series of lovely, lake-like\nreaches, each with its emerald oval of hills and rolling valleys\nwhere harvests were ripening.  And in the shadow of the awning\nSusan heard from those pretty, coarse lips, in language softened\nindeed but still far from refined, about all there is to know\nconcerning the causes and consequences of the eternal struggle\nthat rages round sex.  To make her tale vivid, Mabel illustrated\nit by the story of her own life from girlhood to the present\nhour.  And she omitted no detail necessary to enforce the lesson\nin life.  A few days before Susan would not have believed, would\nnot have understood.  Now she both believed and understood.  And\nnothing that Mabel told her--not the worst of the possibilities\nin the world in which she was adventuring--burned deep enough to\npenetrate beyond the wound she had already received and to give\nher a fresh sensation of pain and horror.\n\n\"You don't seem to be horrified,\" said Mabel.\n\nSusan shook her head.  \"No,\" she said.  \"I feel--somehow I feel better.\"\n\nMabel eyed her curiously--had a sense of a mystery of suffering\nwhich she dared not try to explore.  She said:  \"Better?  That's\nqueer.  You don't take it at all as I thought you would.\"\n\nSaid Susan:  \"I had about made up my mind it was all bad.  I see\nthat maybe it isn't.\"\n\n\"Oh, the world isn't such a bad place--in lots of ways.  You'll\nget a heap of fun out of it if you don't take things or yourself\nseriously.  I wish to God I'd had somebody to tell me, instead of\nhaving to spell it out, a letter at a time.  I've got just two\npieces of advice to give you.\" And she stopped speaking and\ngazed away toward the shore with a look that seemed to be\npiercing the hills.\n\n\"Please do,\" urged Susan, when Mabel's long mood of abstraction\ntried her patience.\n\n\"Oh--yes--two pieces of advice.  The first is, don't drink.\nThere's nothing to it--and it'll play hell--excuse me--it'll\nspoil your looks and your health and give you a woozy head when\nyou most need a steady one.  Don't drink--that's the first advice.\"\n\n\"I won't,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Oh, yes, you will.  But remember my advice all the same.  The\nsecond is, don't sell your body to get a living, unless you've\ngot to.\"\n\n\"I couldn't do that,\" said the girl.\n\nMabel laughed queerly.  \"Oh, yes, you could--and will.  But\nremember my advice.  Don't sell your body because it seems to be\nthe easy way to make a living.  I know most women get their\nliving that way.\"\n\n\"Oh--no--no, indeed!\" protested Susan.\n\n\"What a child you are!\" laughed Mabel.  \"What's marriage but\nthat?. . .  Believe your Aunt Betsy, it's the poorest way to make\na living that ever was invented--marriage or the other thing.\nSometimes you'll be tempted to.  You're pretty, and you'll find\nyourself up against it with no way out.  You'll have to give in\nfor a time, no doubt.  The men run things in this world, and\nthey'll compel it--one way or another.  But fight back to your\nfeet again.  If I'd taken my own advice, my name would be on\nevery dead wall in New York in letters two feet high.\nInstead----\"  She laughed, without much bitterness.  \"And why?  All\nbecause I never learned to stand alone.  I've even supported\nmen--to have something to lean on!  How's that for a poor fool?\"\n\nThere Violet Anstruther called her.  She rose.  \"You won't take my\nadvice,\" she said by way of conclusion.  \"Nobody'll take advice.\nNobody can.  We ain't made that way.  But don't forget what I've\nsaid.  And when you've wobbled way off maybe it'll give you\nsomething to steer back by.\"\n\nSusan sat on there, deep in the deepest of those brown studies\nthat had been characteristic of her from early childhood.\nOften--perhaps most often--abstraction means only mental\nfogginess.  But Susan happened to be of those who can\nconcentrate--can think things out.  And that afternoon, oblivious\nof the beauty around her, even unconscious of where she was, she\nstudied the world of reality--that world whose existence, even\nthe part of it lying within ourselves, we all try to ignore or\nto evade or to deny, and get soundly punished for our folly.\nTaking advantage of the floods of light Mabel Connemora had let\nin upon her--full light where there had been a dimness that was\nequal to darkness--she drew from the closets of memory and\nexamined all the incidents of her life--all that were typical or\nfor other reasons important.  One who comes for the first time\ninto new surroundings sees more, learns more about them in a\nbrief period than has been seen and known by those who have\nlived there always.  After a few hours of recalling and\nreconstructing Susan Lenox understood Sutherland probably better\nthan she would have understood it had she lived a long eventless\nlife there.  And is not every Sutherland the world in miniature?\n\nShe also understood her own position--why the world of\nrespectability had cast her out as soon as she emerged from\nchildhood--why she could not have hoped for the lot to which\nother girls looked forward--why she belonged with the outcasts,\nin a world apart--and must live her life there.  She felt that\nshe could not hope to be respected, loved, married.  She must\nwork out her destiny along other lines.  She understood it all,\nmore clearly than would have been expected of her.  And it is\nimportant to note that she faced her future without repining or\nself-pity, without either joy or despondency.  She would go on;\nshe would do as best she could.  And nothing that might befall\ncould equal what she had suffered in the throes of the casting out.\n\nBurlingham roused her from her long reverie.  He evidently had\ncome straight from his nap--stocking feet, shirt open at the\ncollar, trousers sagging and face shiny with the sweat that\naccumulates during sleep on a hot day.  \"Round that bend ahead of\nus is Sutherland,\" said he, pointing forward.\n\nUp she started in alarm.\n\n\"Now, don't get fractious,\" cried he cheerfully.  \"We'll not\ntouch shore for an hour, at least.  And nobody's allowed aboard.\nYou can keep to the cabin.  I'll see that you're not bothered.\"\n\n\"And--this evening?\"\n\n\"You can keep to the dressing-room until the show's over and the\npeople've gone ashore.  And tomorrow morning, bright and early, we'll\nbe off.  I promised Pat a day for a drunk at Sutherland.  He'll have\nto postpone it.  I'll give him three at Jeffersonville, instead.\"\n\nSusan put on her sunbonnet as soon as the show boat rounded the\nbend above town.  Thus she felt safe in staying on deck and\nwatching the town drift by.  She did not begin to think of going\ninto the cabin until Pat was working the boat in toward the\nlanding a square above the old familiar wharf-boat.  \"What day is\nthis?\" she asked Eshwell.\n\n\"Saturday.\"\n\nOnly Saturday!  And last Monday--less than five days ago--she had\nleft this town for her Cincinnati adventure.  She felt as if\nmonths, years, had passed.  The town seemed strange to her, and\nshe recalled the landmarks as if she were revisiting in age the\nscenes of youth.  How small the town seemed, after Cincinnati!\nAnd how squat!  Then----\n\nShe saw the cupola of the schoolhouse.  Its rooms, the\nplaygrounds flashed before her mind's eye--the teachers she had\nliked--those she had feared--the face of her uncle, so kind and\nloving--that same face, with hate and contempt in it----\n\nShe hurried into the cabin, tears blinding her eyes, her throat\nchoked with sobs.\n\n\nThe Burlingham Floating Palace of Thespians tied up against the\nfloat of Bill Phibbs's boathouse--a privilege for which\nBurlingham had to pay two dollars.  Pat went ashore with a sack\nof handbills to litter through the town.  Burlingham followed, to\nvisit the offices of the two evening newspapers and by \"handing\nthem out a line of smooth talk\"--the one art whereof he was\nmaster--to get free advertising.  Also there were groceries to\nbuy and odds and ends of elastic, fancy crêpe, paper muslin and\nthe like for repairing the shabby costumes.  The others remained\non board, Eshwell and Tempest to guard the boat against the\nswarms of boys darting and swooping and chattering like a huge\nflock of impudent English sparrows.  An additional--and the\nchief--reason for Burlingham's keeping the two actors close was\nthat Eshwell was a drunkard and Tempest a gambler.  Neither could\nbe trusted where there was the least temptation.  Each despised\nthe other's vice and despised the other for being slave to it.\nBurlingham could trust Eshwell to watch Tempest, could trust\nTempest to watch Eshwell.\n\nSusan helped Mabel with the small and early supper--cold chicken\nand ham, fried potatoes and coffee.  Afterward all dressed in the\ncabin.  Some of the curtains for dividing off the berths were\ndrawn, out of respect to Susan not yet broken to the ways of a\nmode of life which made privacy and personal modesty\nimpossible--and when any human custom becomes impossible, it\ndoes not take human beings long to discover that it is also\nfoolish and useless.  The women had to provide for a change of\ncostumes.  As the dressing-room behind the stage was only a\nnarrow space between the back drop and the forward wall of the\ncabin, dressing in it was impossible, so Mabel and Vi put on a\ncostume of tights, and over it a dress.  Susan was invited to\nremain and help.  The making-up of the faces interested her; she\nwas amazed by the transformation of Mabel into youthful\nloveliness, with a dairy maid's bloom in place of her pallid\npastiness.  On the other hand, make-up seemed to bring out the\nhorrors of Miss Anstruther's big, fat, yet hollow face, and to\ncreate other and worse horrors--as if in covering her face it\nsomehow uncovered her soul.  When the two women stripped and got\ninto their tights, Susan with polite modesty turned away.\nHowever, catching sight of Miss Anstruther in the mirror that\nhad been hung up under one of the side lamps, she was so\nfascinated that she gazed furtively at her by that indirect way.\n\nViolet happened to see, laughed.  \"Look at the baby's shocked\nface, Mabel,\" she cried.\n\nBut she was mistaken.  It was sheer horror that held Susan's gaze\nupon Violet's incredible hips and thighs, violently obtruded by\nthe close-reefed corset.  Mabel had a slender figure, the waist\ntoo short and the legs too nearly of the same girth from hip to\nankle, but for all that, attractive.  Susan had never before seen\na woman in tights without any sort of skirt.\n\n\"You would show up well in those things,\" Violet said to her,\n\"that is, for a thin woman.  The men don't care much for thinness.\"\n\n\"Not the clodhoppers and roustabouts that come to see us,\"\nretorted Mabel.  \"The more a woman looks like a cow or a sow, the\nbetter they like it.  They don't believe it's female unless it\nlooks like what they're used to in the barnyard and the cattle pen.\"\n\nMiss Anstruther was not in the least offended.  She paraded,\njauntily switching her great hips and laughing.  \"Jealous!\" she\nteased.  \"You poor little broomstick.\"\n\nBurlingham was in a white flannel suit that looked well enough\nin those dim lights.  The make-up gave him an air of rakish\nyouth.  Eshwell had got himself into an ordinary sack suit.\nTempest was in the tattered and dirty finery of a\nseventeenth-century courtier.  The paint and black made Eshwell's\nface fat and comic; it gave Tempest distinction, made his hollow\nblazing eyes brilliant and large.  All traces of habitation were\neffaced from the \"auditorium\"; the lamps were lighted, a ticket\nbox was set up on the rear deck and an iron bar was thrown half\nacross the rear entrance to the cabin, that only one person at\na time might be able to pass.  The curtain was let down--a gaudy\nsmear of a garden scene in a French palace in the eighteenth\ncentury.  Pat, the orchestra, put on a dress coat and vest and\na \"dickey\"; the coat had white celluloid cuffs pinned in the\nsleeves at the wrists.\n\nAs it was still fully an hour and a half from dark, Susan hid on\nthe stage; when it should be time for the curtain to go up she\nwould retreat to the dressing-room.  Through a peephole in the\ncurtain she admired the auditorium; and it did look surprisingly\nwell by lamplight, with the smutches and faded spots on its\nbright paint softened or concealed.  \"How many will it hold?\" she\nasked Mabel, who was walking up and down, carrying her long train.\n\n\"A hundred and twenty comfortably,\" replied Miss Connemora.  \"A\nhundred and fifty crowded.  It has held as high as thirty\ndollars, but we'll be lucky if we get fifteen tonight.\"\n\nSusan glanced round at her.  She was smoking a cigarette,\nhandling it like a man.  Susan's expression was so curious that\nMabel laughed.  Susan, distressed, cried:  \"I'm sorry if--if I was\nimpolite.\"\n\n\"Oh, you couldn't be impolite,\" said Mabel.  \"You've got that to\nlearn, too--and mighty important it is.  We all smoke.  Why not?\nWe got out of cigarettes, but Bob bought a stock this afternoon.\"\n\nSusan turned to the peephole.  Pat, ready to take tickets, was\n\"barking\" vigorously in the direction of shore, addressing a\ncrowd which Susan of course could not see.  Whenever he paused\nfor breath, Burlingham leaned from the box and took it up,\npouring out a stream of eulogies of his show in that easy,\nlightly cynical voice of his.  And the audience straggled\nin--young fellows and their girls, roughs from along the river\nfront, farmers in town for a day's sport.  Susan did not see a\nsingle familiar face, and she had supposed she knew, by sight at\nleast, everyone in Sutherland.  From fear lest she should see\nsomeone she knew, her mind changed to longing.  At last she was\nrewarded.  Down the aisle swaggered Redney King, son of the\nwasherwoman, a big hulking bully who used to tease her by\npulling her hair during recess and by kicking at her shins when\nthey happened to be next each other in the class standing in\nlong line against the wall of the schoolroom for recitation.\nFrom her security she smiled at Redney as representative of all\nshe loved in the old town.\n\nAnd now the four members of the company on the stage and in the\ndressing-room lost their ease and contemptuous indifference.\nThey had been talking sneeringly about \"yokels\" and \"jays\" and\n\"slum bums.\" They dropped all that, as there spread over them\nthe mysterious spell of the crowd.  As individuals the\nprovincials in those seats were ridiculous; as a mass they were\nan audience, an object of fear and awe.  Mabel was almost in\ntears; Violet talked rapidly, with excited gestures and nervous\nadjustments of various parts of her toilet.  The two men paced\nabout, Eshwell trembling, Tempest with sheer fright in his\nrolling eyes.\n\nThey wet their dry lips with dry tongues.  Each again and again\nasked the other anxiously how he was looking and paced away\nwithout waiting for the answer.  The suspense and nervous terror\ntook hold of Susan; she stood in the corner of the\ndressing-room, pressing herself close against the wall, her\nfingers tightly interlocked and hot and cold tremors chasing up\nand down her body.\n\nBurlingham left the box and combined Pat's duties with his\nown--a small matter, as the audience was seated and a guard at\nthe door was necessary only to keep the loafers on shore from\nrushing in free.  Pat advanced to the little space reserved\nbefore the stage, sat down and fell to tuning his violin with\nall the noise he could make, to create the illusion of a full\norchestra.  Miss Anstruther appeared in one of the forward side\ndoors of the auditorium, very dignified in her black satin\n(paper muslin) dress, with many and sparkling hair and neck\nornaments and rings that seemed alight.  She bowed to the\naudience, pulled a little old cottage organ from under the stage\nand seated herself at it.\n\nAfter the overture, a pause.  Susan, peeping through a hole in\nthe drop, saw the curtain go up, drew a long breath of terror as\nthe audience was revealed beyond the row of footlights, beyond\nthe big, befrizzled blond head of Violet and the drink-seared\nface of Pat.  From the rear of the auditorium came Burlingham's\nsmooth-flowing, faintly amused voice, announcing the beginning\nof the performance \"a delightful feast throughout, ladies and\ngentlemen, amusing yet elevating, ever moral yet with none of\nthe depressing sadness of puritanism.  For, ladies and gentlemen,\nwhile we are pious, we are not puritan.  The first number is a\nmonologue, 'The Mad Prince,' by that eminent artist, Gregory\nTempest.  He has delivered it before vast audiences amid thunders\nof applause.\"\n\nSusan thrilled as Tempest strode forth--Tempest transformed by\nthe footlights and by her young imagination into a true king\nmost wonderfully and romantically bereft of reason by the woes\nthat had assailed him in horrid phalanxes.  If anyone had pointed\nout to her that Tempest's awful voice was simply cheap ranting,\nor that her own woes had been as terrible as any that had ever\nvisited a king, or that when people go mad it is never from\ngrief but from insides unromantically addled by foolish eating\nand drinking--if anyone had attempted then and there to educate\nthe girl, how angry it would have made her, how she would have\nhated that well-meaning person for spoiling her illusion!\n\nThe spell of the stage seized her with Tempest's first line,\nfirst elegant despairing gesture.  It held her through Burlingham\nand Anstruther's \"sketch\" of a matrimonial quarrel, through\nConnemora and Eshwell's \"delicious symphonic romanticism\" of a\nlovers' quarrel and making up, through Tempest's recitation of\n\"Lasca,\" dying to shield her cowboy lover from the hoofs of the\nstampeded herd.  How the tears did stream from Susan's eyes, as\nTempest wailed out those last lines:\n\n\nBut I wonder why I do not care for the things that are like the\nthings that were?\n\nCan it be that half my heart lies buried there, in Texas down by\nthe Rio Grande?\n\n\nShe saw the little grave in the desert and the vast blue sky and\nthe buzzard sailing lazily to and fro, and it seemed to her that\nTempest himself had inspired such a love, had lost a sweetheart\nin just that way.  No wonder he looked gaunt and hollow-eyed and\nsallow.  The last part of the performance was Holy Land and comic\npictures thrown from the rear on a sheet substituted for the\ndrop.  As Burlingham had to work the magic lantern from the\ndressing-room (while Tempest, in a kind of monk's robe, used\nhis voice and elocutionary powers in describing the pictures,\nnow lugubriously and now in \"lighter vein\"), Susan was forced to\nretreat to the forward deck and missed that part of the show.\nBut she watched Burlingham shifting the slides and altering the\nforms of the lenses, and was in another way as much thrilled and\nspellbound as by the acting.\n\nNor did the spell vanish when, with the audience gone, they all\nsat down to a late supper, and made coarse jests and mocked at\ntheir own doings and at the people who had applauded.  Susan did\nnot hear.  She felt proud that she was permitted in so\ndistinguished a company.  Every disagreeable impression vanished.\nHow could she have thought these geniuses common and cheap!  How\nhad she dared apply to them the standards of the people, the\ndull, commonplace people, among whom she had been brought up!  If\nshe could only qualify for membership in this galaxy!  The\nthought made her feel like a worm aspiring to be a star.\nTempest, whom she had liked least, now filled her with\nadmiration.  She saw the tragedy of his life plain and sad upon\nhis features.  She could not look at him without her heart's\ncontracting in an ache.\n\nIt was not long before Mr. Tempest, who believed himself a\nlady-killer, noted the ingenuous look in the young girl's face,\nand began to pose.  And it was hardly three bites of a ham\nsandwich thereafter when Mabel Connemora noted Tempest's\nshootings of his cuffs and rumplings of his oily ringlets and\nrollings of his hollow eyes.  And at the sight Miss Mabel's\nbright eyes became bad and her tongue shot satire at him.  But\nSusan did not observe this.\n\nAfter supper they went straightway to bed.  Burlingham drew the\ncurtains round the berth let down for Susan.  The others indulged\nin no such prudery on so hot a night.  They put out the lamps and\ngot ready for bed and into it by the dim light trickling in\nthrough the big rear doorway and the two small side doorways\nforward.  To help on the circulation of air Pat raised the stage\ncurtain and drop, and opened the little door forward.  Each\nsleeper had a small netting suspended over him from the ceiling;\nwithout that netting the dense swarms of savage mosquitoes would\nhave made sleep impossible.  As it was, the loud singing of these\nbaffled thousands kept Susan awake.\n\nAfter a while, to calm her brain, excited by the evenings\nthronging impressions and by the new--or, rather,\nreviewed--ambitions born of them, Susan rose and went softly out\non deck, in her nightgown of calico slip.  Because of the breeze\nthe mosquitoes did not trouble her there, and she stood a long\ntime watching the town's few faint lights--watching the stars,\nthe thronging stars of the Milky Way--dreaming--dreaming--dreaming.\nYesterday had almost faded from her, for youth lives only in\ntomorrow--youth in tomorrow, age in yesterday, and none of us\nin today which is all we really have.  And she, with her wonderful\nhealth of body meaning youth as long as it lasted, she would\ncertainly be young until she was very old--would keep her youth--her\ndreams--her living always in tomorrow.  She was dreaming of her\nfirst real tomorrow, now.  She would work hard at this wonderful\nprofession--_her_ profession!--would be humble and attentive; and\nsurely the day must come when she too would feel upon her heart\nthe intoxicating beat of those magic waves of applause!\n\nSusan, more excited than ever, slipped softly into the cabin and\nstole into her curtained berth.  Like the soughing of the storm\nabove the whimper of the tortured leaves the stentorian snorings\nof two of the sleepers resounded above the noise of the\nmosquitoes.  She had hardly extended herself in her close little\nbed when she heard a stealthy step, saw one of her curtains\ndrawn aside.\n\n\"Who is it?\" she whispered, unsuspiciously, for she could see\nonly a vague form darkening the space between the parted curtains.\n\nThe answer came in a hoarse undertone:  \"Ye dainty little\ndarling!\" She sat up, struck out madly, screamed at the top of\nher lungs.  The curtains fell back into place, the snoring\nstopped.  Susan, all in a sweat and a shiver, lay quiet.  Hoarse\nwhispering; then in Burlingham's voice stern and gruff--\"Get\nback to your bed and let her alone, you rolling-eyed----\"  The\nsentence ended with as foul a spatter of filth as man can fling\nat man.  Silence again, and after a few minutes the two snores\nresumed their bass accompaniment to the falsetto of the mosquito\nchorus.\n\nSusan got a little troubled sleep, was wide awake when Violet\ncame saying, \"If you want to bathe, I'll bring you a bucket of\nwater and you can put up your berth and do it behind your curtains.\"\n\nSusan thanked her and got a most refreshing bath.  When she\nlooked out the men were on deck, Violet was getting breakfast,\nand Connemora was combing her short, thinning, yellow hair\nbefore a mirror hung up near one of the forward doors.  In the\nmirror Connemora saw her, smiled and nodded.\n\n\"You can fix your hair here,\" said she.  \"I'm about done.  You can\nuse my brush.\"\n\nAnd when Susan was busy at the mirror, Mabel lounged on a seat\nnear by smoking a before-breakfast cigarette.  \"I wish to God\nI had your hair,\" said she.  \"I never did have such a wonderful\ncrop of grass on the knoll, and the way it up and drops out in\nbunches every now and then sets me crazy.  It won't be long\nbefore I'll be down to Vi's three hairs and a half.  You haven't\nseen her without her wigs?  Well, don't, if you happen to be\nfeeling a bit off.  How Burlingham can--\" There she stopped, blew\nout a volume of smoke, grinned half amusedly, half in sympathy\nwith the innocence she was protecting--or, rather, was\ninitiating by cautious degrees.  \"Who was it raised the row last\nnight?\" she inquired.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Susan, her face hid by the mass of wavy\nhair she was brushing forward from roots to ends.\n\n\"You don't?  I guess you've got a kind of idea, though.\"\n\nNo answer from the girl.\n\n\"Well, it doesn't matter.  It isn't your fault.\" Mabel smoked\nreflectively.  \"I'm not jealous of _him_--a woman never is.  It's\nthe idea of another woman's getting away with her property,\nwhether she wants it or not--_that's_ what sets her mad-spot to\nhumming.  No, I don't give a--a cigarette butt--for that greasy\nbum actor.  But I've always got to have somebody.\" She laughed.\n\"The idea of his thinking _you'd_ have _him_!  What peacocks men are!\"\n\nSusan understood.  The fact of this sort of thing was no longer\na mystery to her.  But the why of the fact--that seemed more\namazing than ever.  Now that she had discovered that her notion\nof love being incorporeal was as fanciful as Santa Claus, she\ncould not conceive why it should be at all.  As she was bringing\nround the braids for the new coiffure she had adopted she said\nto Mabel:\n\n\"You--love him?\"\n\n\"I?\" Mabel laughed immoderately.  \"You can have him, if you want him.\"\n\nSusan shuddered.  \"Oh, no,\" she said.  \"I suppose he's very\nnice--and really he's quite a wonderful actor.  But I--I don't\ncare for men.\"\n\nMabel laughed again--curt, bitter.  \"Wait,\" she said.\n\nSusan shook her head, with youth's positiveness.\n\n\"What's caring got to do with it?\" pursued Mabel, ignoring the\nheadshake.  \"I've been about quite a bit, and I've yet to see\nanybody that really cared for anybody else.  We care for\nourselves.  But a man needs a woman, and a woman needs a man.  They\ncall it loving.  They might as well call eating loving.  Ask Burly.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nAT breakfast Tempest was precisely as usual, and so were the\nothers.  Nor was there effort or any sort of pretense in this.  We\nunderstand only that to which we are accustomed; the man of\npeace is amazed by the veteran's nonchalance in presence of\ndanger and horror, of wound and death.  To these river wanderers,\nveterans in the unconventional life, where the unusual is the\nusual, the unexpected the expected, whatever might happen was\nthe matter of course, to be dealt with and dismissed.  Susan\nnaturally took her cue from them.  When Tempest said something to\nher in the course of the careless conversation round the\nbreakfast table, she answered--and had no sense of constraint.\nThus, an incident that in other surroundings would have been in\nsome way harmful through receiving the exaggeration of undue\nemphasis, caused less stir than the five huge and fiery mosquito\nbites Eshwell had got in the night.  And Susan unconsciously\nabsorbed one of those lessons in the science and art of living\nthat have decisive weight in shaping our destinies.  For\nintelligent living is in large part learning to ignore the\nunprofitable that one may concentrate upon the profitable.\n\nBurlingham announced that they would cast off and float down to\nBethlehem.  There was a chorus of protests.  \"Why, we ought to\nstay here a week!\" cried Miss Anstruther.  \"We certainly caught\non last night.\"\n\n\"Didn't we take in seventeen dollars?\" demanded Eshwell.  \"We\ncan't do better than that anywhere.\"\n\n\"Who's managing this show?\" asked Burlingham in his suave but\neffective way.  \"I think I know what I'm about.\"\n\nHe met their grumblings with the utmost good-humor and remained\ninflexible.  Susan listened with eyes down and burning cheeks.\nShe knew Burlingham was \"leaving the best cow unmilked,\" as\nConnemora put it, because he wished to protect her.  She told him\nso when they were alone on the forward deck a little later, as\nthe boat was floating round the bend below Sutherland.\n\n\"Yes,\" he admitted.  \"I've great hopes from your ballads.  I want\nto get you on.\" He looked round casually, saw that no one was\nlooking, drew a peculiarly folded copy of the _Sutherland\nCourier_ from his pocket.  \"Besides\"--said he, holding out the\npaper--\"read that.\"\n\nSusan read:\n\n\nGeorge Warham, Esq., requests us to announce that he has\nincreased the reward for information as to the whereabouts of\nMrs. Susan Ferguson, his young niece, nee Susan Lenox, to one\nthousand dollars.  There are grave fears that the estimable and\nlovely young lady, who disappeared from her husband's farm the\nnight of her marriage, has, doubtless in a moment of insanity,\nended her life.  We hope not.\n\n\nSusan lifted her gaze from this paragraph, after she had read it\nuntil the words ran together in a blur.  She found Burlingham\nlooking at her.  Said he:  \"As I told you before, I don't want to\nknow anything.  But when I read that, it occurred to me, if some\nof the others saw it they might think it was you--and might do\na dirty trick.\" He sighed, with a cynical little smile.  \"I was\ntempted, myself.  A thousand is quite a bunch.  You don't\nknow--not yet--how a chance to make some money--any old\nway--compels a man--or a woman--when money's as scarce and as\nuseful as it is in this world.  As you get along, you'll notice,\nmy dear, that the people who get moral goose flesh at the shady\ndoings of others are always people who haven't ever really been\nup against it.  I don't know why I didn't----\"  He shrugged his\nshoulders.  \"Now, my dear, you're in on the secret of why I\nhaven't got up in the world.\" He smiled cheerfully.  \"But I may\nyet.  The game's far from over.\"\n\nShe realized that he had indeed made an enormous sacrifice for\nher; for, though very ignorant about money, a thousand dollars\nseemed a fortune.  She had no words; she looked away toward the\nemerald shore, and her eyes filled and her lip quivered.  How\nmuch goodness there was in the world--how much generosity and\naffection!\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" he went on, \"that you oughtn't to go back.  But\nit's your own business.  I've a kind of feeling you know what\nyou're about.\"\n\n\"No matter what happens to me,\" said she, \"I'll never regret\nwhat I've done.  I'd kill myself before I'd spend another day\nwith the man they made me marry.\"\n\n\"Well--I'm not fond of dying,\" observed Burlingham, in the\nlight, jovial tone that would most quickly soothe her agitation,\n\"but I think I'd take my chances with the worms rather than with\nthe dry rot of a backwoods farm.  You may not get your meals so\nregular out in the world, but you certainly do live.  Yes--that\nbackwoods life, for anybody with a spark of spunk, is simply\nbeing dead and knowing it.\" He tore the _Courier_ into six\npieces, flung them over the side.  \"None of the others saw the\npaper,\" said he.  \"So--Miss Lorna Sackville is perfectly safe.\"\nHe patted her on the shoulder.  \"And she owes me a thousand and\ntwo dollars.\"\n\n\"I'll pay--if you'll be patient,\" said the girl, taking his jest gravely.\n\n\"It's a good gamble,\" said he.  Then he laughed.  \"I guess that\nhad something to do with my virtue.  There's always a practical\nreason--always.\"\n\nBut the girl was not hearing his philosophies.  Once more she was\noverwhelmed and stupefied by the events that had dashed in,\nupon, and over her like swift succeeding billows that give the\nswimmer no pause for breath or for clearing the eyes.\n\n\"No--you're not dreaming,\" said Burlingham, laughing at her\nexpression.  \"At least, no more than we all are.  Sometimes I\nsuspect the whole damn shooting-match is nothing but a dream.\nWell, it's a pretty good one eh?\"\n\nAnd she agreed with him, as she thought how smoothly and\nagreeably they were drifting into the unknown, full of the most\nfascinating possibilities.  How attractive this life was, how\nmuch at home she felt among these people, and if anyone should\ntell him about her birth or about how she had been degraded by\nFerguson, it wouldn't in the least affect their feeling toward\nher, she was sure.  \"When do--do you--try me?\" she asked.\n\n\"Tomorrow night, at Bethlehem--a bum little town for us.  We'll\nstay there a couple of days.  I want you to get used to\nappearing.\" He nodded at her encouragingly.  \"You've got stuff in\nyou, real stuff.  Don't you doubt it.  Get self-confidence--conceit,\nif you please.  Nobody arrives anywhere without it.  You want to\nfeel that you can do what you want to do.  A fool's conceit is\nthat he's it already.  A sensible man's conceit is that he can be\nit, if he'll only work hard and in the right way.  See?\"\n\n\"I--I think I do,\" said the girl.  \"I'm not sure.\"\n\nBurlingham smoked his cigar in silence.  When he spoke, it was\nwith eyes carefully averted.  \"There's another subject the spirit\nmoves me to talk to you about.  That's the one Miss Connemora\nopened up with you yesterday.\" As Susan moved uneasily, \"Now,\ndon't get scared.  I'm not letting the woman business bother me\nmuch nowadays.  All I think of is how to get on my feet again.  I\nwant to have a theater on Broadway before the old black-flagger\novertakes my craft and makes me walk the plank and jump out into\nthe Big Guess.  So you needn't think I'm going to worry you.  I'm not.\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't think----\"\n\n\"You ought to have, though,\" interrupted he.  \"A man like me is\na rare exception.  I'm a rare exception to my ordinary self, to\nbe quite honest.  It'll be best for you always to assume that every\nman you run across is looking for just one thing.  You know what?\"\n\nSusan, the flush gone from her cheeks, nodded.\n\n\"I suppose Connemora has put you wise.  But there are some things\neven she don't know about that subject.  Now, I want you to\nlisten to your grandfather.  Remember what he says.  And think it\nover until you understand it.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said Susan.\n\n\"In the life you've come out of, virtue in a woman's everything.\nShe's got to be virtuous, or at least to have the reputation of\nit--or she's nothing.  You understand that?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan.  \"I understand that--now.\"\n\n\"Very well.  Now in the life you're going into, virtue in a woman\nis nothing--no more than it is in a man anywhere.  The woman who\nmakes a career becomes like the man who makes a career.  How is\nit with a man?  Some are virtuous, others are not.  But no man\nlets virtue bother him and nobody bothers about his virtue.\nThat's the way it is with a woman who cuts loose from the\nconventional life of society and home and all that.  She is\nvirtuous or not, as she happens to incline.  Her real interest in\nherself, her real value, lies in another direction.  If it\ndoesn't, if she continues to be agitated about her virtue as if\nit were all there is to her--then the sooner she hikes back to\nrespectability, to the conventional routine, why the better for\nher.  She'll never make a career, any more than she could drive\nan automobile through a crowded street and at the same time keep\na big picture hat on straight.  Do you follow me?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" said the girl.  \"I'll have to think about it.\"\n\n\"That's right.  Don't misunderstand.  I'm not talking for or\nagainst virtue.  I'm simply talking practical life, and all I\nmean is that you won't get on there by your virtue, and you\nwon't get on by your lack of virtue.  Now for my advice.\"\n\nSusan's look of unconscious admiration and attention was the\nsubtlest flattery.  Its frank, ingenuous showing of her implicit\ntrust in him so impressed him with his responsibility that he\nhesitated before he said:\n\n\"Never forget this, and don't stop thinking about it until you\nunderstand it:  Make men _as_ men incidental in your life, precisely\nas men who amount to anything make women _as_ women incidental.\"\n\nHer first sensation was obviously disappointing.  She had\nexpected something far more impressive.  Said she:\n\n\"I don't care anything about men.\"\n\n\"Be sensible!  How are you to know now what you care about and\nwhat you don't?\" was Burlingham's laughing rebuke.  \"And in the\nline you've taken--the stage--with your emotions always being\nstirred up, with your thoughts always hovering round the\nrelations of men and women--for that's the only subject of plays\nand music, and with opportunity thrusting at you as it never\nthrusts at conventional people you'll probably soon find you\ncare a great deal about men.  But don't ever let your emotions\nhinder or hurt or destroy you.  Use them to help you.  I guess I'm\nshooting pretty far over that young head of yours, ain't I?\"\n\n\"Not so very far,\" said the girl.  \"Anyhow, I'll remember.\"\n\n\"If you live big enough and long enough, you'll go through three\nstages.  The first is the one you're in now.  They've always\ntaught you without realizing it, and so you think that only the\nstrong can afford to do right.  You think doing right makes the\nordinary person, like yourself, easy prey for those who do\nwrong.  You think that good people--if they're really good--have\nto wait until they get to Heaven before they get a chance.\"\n\n\"Isn't that so?\"\n\n\"No.  But you'll not realize it until you pass into the second\nstage.  There, you'll think you see that only the strong can\nafford to do wrong.  You'll think that everyone, except the\nstrong, gets it in the neck if he or she does anything out of\nthe way.  You'll think you're being punished for your sins, and\nthat, if you had behaved yourself, you'd have got on much\nbetter.  That's the stage that's coming; and what you go through\nwith there--how you come out of the fight--will decide your\nfate--show whether or not you've got the real stuff in you.  Do\nyou understand?\"\n\nSusan shook her head.\n\n\"I thought not.  You haven't lived long enough yet.  Well, I'll\nfinish, anyhow.\"\n\n\"I'll remember,\" said Susan.  \"I'll think about it until I do understand.\"\n\n\"I hope so.  The weather and the scenery make me feel like\nphilosophizing.  Finally, if you come through the second stage\nall right, you'll enter the third stage.  There, you'll see that\nyou were right at first when you thought only the strong could\nafford to do right.  And you'll see that you were right in the\nsecond stage when you thought only the strong could afford to do\nwrong.  For you'll have learned that only the strong can afford\nto act at all, and that they can do right or wrong as they\nplease _because they are strong_.\"\n\n\"Then you don't believe in right, at all!\" exclaimed the girl,\nmuch depressed, but whether for the right or for her friend she\ncould not have told.\n\n\"Now, who said that?\" Demanded he, amused.  \"What _did_ I say?\nWhy--if you want to do right, be strong or you'll be crushed;\nand if you want to do wrong, take care again to be strong--or\nyou'll be crushed.  My moral is, be strong!  In this world the\ngood weaklings and the bad weaklings had better lie low, hide in\nthe tall grass.  The strong inherit the earth.\"\n\nThey were silent a long time, she thinking, he observing her\nwith sad tenderness.  At last he said:\n\n\"You are a nice sweet girl--well brought up.  But that means\nbadly brought up for the life you've got to lead--the life\nyou've got to learn to lead.\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to see that,\" said the girl.  Her gravity made him\nfeel like laughing, and brought the tears to his eyes.  The\nlaughter he suppressed.\n\n\"You're going to fight your way up to what's called the\ntriumphant class--the people on top--they have all the success,\nall the money, all the good times.  Well, the things you've been\ntaught--at church--in the Sunday School--in the nice storybooks\nyou've read--those things are all for the triumphant class, or\nfor people working meekly along in 'the station to which God has\nappointed them' and handing over their earnings to their\nbetters.  But those nice moral things you believe in--they don't\napply to people like you--fighting their way up from the meek\nworking class to the triumphant class.  You won't believe me\nnow--won't understand thoroughly.  But soon you'll see.  Once\nyou've climbed up among the successful people you can afford to\nindulge--in moderation--in practicing the good old moralities.\nAny dirty work you may need done you can hire done and pretend\nnot to know about it.  But while you're climbing, no Golden Rule\nand no turning of the cheek.  Tooth and claw then--not sheathed\nbut naked--not by proxy but in your own person.\"\n\n\"But you're not like that,\" said the girl.\n\n\"The more fool I,\" repeated he.\n\nShe was surprised that she understood so much of what he had\nsaid--childlike wonder at her wise old heart, made wise almost\nin a night--a wedding night.  When Burlingham lapsed into\nsilence, laughing at himself for having talked so far over the\n\"kiddie's\" head, she sat puzzling out what he had said.  The\nworld seemed horribly vast and forbidding, and the sky, so blue\nand bright, seemed far, far away.  She sighed profoundly.  \"I am\nso weak,\" she murmured.  \"I am so ignorant.\"\n\nBurlingham nodded and winked.  \"Yes, but you'll grow,\" said be.\n\"I back you to win.\"\n\nThe color poured into her cheeks, and she burst into tears.\nBurlingham thought he understood; for once his shrewdness went\nfar astray.  Excusably, since he could not know that he had used\nthe same phrase that had closed Spenser's letter to her.\n\n\nLate in the afternoon, when the heat had abated somewhat and\nthey were floating pleasantly along with the washing gently\na-flutter from lines on the roof of the auditorium, Burlingham\nput Eshwell at the rudder and with Pat and the violin rehearsed\nher.  \"The main thing, the only thing to worry about,\" explained\nhe, \"is beginning right.\" She was standing in the center of the\nstage, he on the floor of the auditorium beside the seated\norchestra.  \"That means,\" he went on, \"you've simply got to learn\nto come in right.  We'll practice that for a while.\"\n\nShe went to the wings--where there was barely space for her to\nconceal herself by squeezing tightly against the wall.  At the\nsignal from him she walked out.  As she had the utmost confidence\nin his kindness, and as she was always too deeply interested in\nwhat she and others were doing to be uncomfortably\nself-conscious, she was not embarrassed, and thought she made\nthe crossing and took her stand very well.  He nodded approvingly.\n\"But,\" said he, \"there's a difference between a stage walk and\nwalking anywhere else--or standing.  Nothing is natural on the stage.\nIf it were it would look unnatural, because the stage itself is\nartificial and whatever is there must be in harmony with it.  So\neverything must be done unnaturally in such a way that it _seems_\nnatural.  Just as a picture boat looks natural though it's painted\non a flat surface.  Now I'll illustrate.\"\n\nHe gave her his hand to help her jump down; then he climbed to\nthe stage.  He went to the wings and walked out.  As he came he\ncalled her attention to how he poised his body, how he advanced\nso that there would be from the auditorium no unsightly view of\ncrossing legs, how he arranged hands, arms, shoulders, legs,\nhead, feet for an attitude of complete rest.  He repeated his\nillustration again and again, Susan watching and listening with\nopen-eyed wonder and admiration.  She had never dreamed that so\nsimple a matter could be so complex.  When he got her up beside\nhim and went through it with her, she soon became as used to the\nnew motions as a beginner at the piano to stretching an octave.\nBut it was only after more than an hour's practice that she\nmoved him to say:\n\n\"That'll do for a beginning.  Now, we'll sing.\"\n\nShe tried \"Suwanee River\" first and went through it fairly well,\nsinging to him as he stood back at the rear door.  He was\nenthusiastic--cunning Burlingham, who knew so well how to get\nthe best out of everyone!  \"Mighty good--eh, Pat?  Yes, mighty\ngood.  You've got something better than a great voice, my dear.\nYou've got magnetism.  The same thing that made me engage you the\nminute you asked me is going to make you--well, go a long\nways--a _long_ ways.  Now, we'll try 'The Last Rose of Summer.'\"\n\nShe sang even better.  And this improvement continued through the\nother four songs of her repertoire.  His confidence in her was\ncontagious; it was so evident that he really did believe in her.\nAnd Pat, too, wagged his head in a way that made her feel good\nabout herself.  Then Burlingham called in the others whom he had\nsent to the forward deck.  Before them the girl went all to\npieces.  She made her entrance badly, she sang worse.  And the\nworse she sang, the worse she felt and the worse her next\nattempt was.  At last, with nerves unstrung, she broke down and\nsobbed.  Burlingham climbed up to pat her on the shoulder.\n\n\"That's the best sign yet,\" said he.  \"It shows you've got\ntemperament.  Yes--you've got the stuff in you.\"\n\nHe quieted her, interested her in the purely mechanical part of\nwhat she was doing.  \"Don't think of who you're doing it before,\nor of how you're doing it, but only of getting through each step\nand each note.  If your head's full of that, you'll have no room\nfor fright.\" And she was ready to try again.  When she finished\nthe last notes of \"Suwanee River,\" there was an outburst of\nhearty applause.  And the sound that pleased her most was\nTempest's rich rhetorical \"Bravo!\" As a man she abhorred him;\nbut she respected the artist.  And in unconsciously drawing this\ndistinction she gave proof of yet another quality that was to\ncount heavily in the coming days.  Artist he was not.  But she\nthought him an artist.  A girl or boy without the intelligence\nthat can develop into flower and fruit would have seen and felt\nonly Tempest, the odious personality.\n\nBurlingham did not let her off until she was ready to drop with\nexhaustion.  And after supper, when they were floating slowly on,\nwell out of the channel where they might be run down by some\npassing steamer with a flint-hearted captain or pilot, she had\nto go at it again.  She went to bed early, and she slept without\na motion or a break until the odor of the cooking breakfast\nawakened her.  When she came out, her face was bright for the\nfirst time.  She was smiling, laughing, chatting, was delighted\nwith everything and everybody.  Even the thought of Roderick\nSpenser laid up with a broken leg recurred less often and less\nvividly.  It seemed to her that the leg must be about well.  The\nimagination of healthy youth is reluctant to admit ideas of\ngloom in any circumstances.  In circumstances of excitement and\nadventure, such as Susan's at that time, it flatly refuses to\nadmit them.\n\nThey were at anchor before a little town sprawled upon the\nfields between hills and river edge.  A few loafers were chewing\ntobacco and inspecting the show boat from the shady side of a\npile of lumber.  Pat had already gone forth with the bundle of\nhandbills; he was not only waking up the town, but touring the\ncountry in horse and buggy, was agitating the farmers--for the\nshow boat was to stay at least two nights at Bethlehem.  \"And we\nought to do pretty well,\" said Burlingham.  \"The wheat's about\nall threshed, and there's a kind of lull.  The hayseeds aren't so\ndead tired at night.  A couple of weeks ago we couldn't have got\nhalf a house by paying for it.\"\n\nAs the afternoon wore away and the sun disappeared behind the\nhills to the southwest, Susan's spirits oozed.  Burlingham and\nthe others--deliberately--paid no attention to her, acted as if\nno great, universe-stirring event were impending.  Immediately\nafter supper Burlingham said:\n\n\"Now, Vi, get busy and put her into her harness.  Make her\na work of art.\"\n\nNever was there a finer display of unselfishness than in their\neagerness to help her succeed, in their intense nervous anxiety\nlest she should not make a hit.  The bad in human nature, as\nMabel Connemora had said, is indeed almost entirely if not\nentirely the result of the compulsion of circumstances; the good\nis the natural outcropping of normal instincts, and resumes\ncontrol whenever circumstances permit.  These wandering players\nhad suffered too much not to have the keenest and gentlest\nsympathy.  Susan looked on Tempest as a wicked man; yet she could\nnot but be touched by his almost hysterical excitement over her\ndebut, when the near approach of the hour made it impossible for\nhis emotional temperament longer to hide its agitation.  Every\none of them gave or loaned her a talisman--Tempest, a bit of\nrabbit's foot; Anstruther, a ring that had twice saved her from\ndrowning (at least, it had been on her finger each time);\nConnemora, a hunchback's tooth on a faded velvet string; Pat, a\npenny which happened to be of the date of her birth year (the\npresence of the penny was regarded by all as a most encouraging\nsign); Eshwell loaned her a miniature silver bug he wore on his\nwatch chain; Burlingham's contribution was a large\nbuckeye----\"Ever since I've had that, I've never been without at\nleast the price of a meal in my pocket.\"\n\nThey had got together for her a kind of evening dress, a pale\nblue chiffon-like drapery that left her lovely arms and\nshoulders bare and clung softly to the lines of her figure.  They\ndid her hair up in a graceful sweep from the brow and a simple\ncoil behind.  She looked like a woman, yet like a child dressed\nas a woman, too, for there was as always that exuberant vitality\nwhich made each of the hairs of her head seem individual,\nelectric.  The rouge gave her color, enhanced into splendor the\nbrilliance of her violet-gray eyes--eyes so intensely colored\nand so admirably framed that they were noted by the least\nobservant.  When Anstruther had put the last touches to her\ntoilet and paraded her to the others, there was a chorus of\nenthusiasm.  The men no less than the women viewed her with the\nprofessional eye.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you all?\" cried Burlingham, as they looked her up\nand down like a group of connoisseurs inspecting a statue.\n\"Wasn't I right?\"\n\n\"'It is the dawn, and Juliet is the east,'\" orated Tempest in\nrich, romantic tones.\n\n\"A damn shame to waste her on these yaps,\" said Eshwell.\n\nConnemora embraced her with tearful eyes.  \"And as sweet as you\nare lovely, you dear!\" she cried.  \"You simply can't help winning.\"\n\nThe two women thought her greatest charms were her form and her\nfeet and ankles.  The men insisted that her charm of charms was\nher eyes.  And certainly, much could be said for that view.\nSusan's violet-gray eyes, growing grayer when she was\nthoughtful, growing deeper and clearer and softer shining\nviolet when her emotions were touched--Susan's eyes were\nundoubtedly unusual even in a race in which homely eyes are the\nexception.\n\nWhen it was her turn and she emerged into the glare of the\nfootlights, she came to a full stop and an awful wave of\nweakness leaped up through legs and body to blind her eyes and\ncrash upon her brain.  She shook her head, lifted it high like a\nswimmer shaking off a wave.  Her gaze leaped in terror across the\nblackness of the auditorium with its thick-strewn round white\ndisks of human faces, sought the eyes of Burlingham standing in\nfull view in the center of the rear doorway--where he had told\nher to look for him.  She heard Pat playing the last of the\nopening chords; Burlingham lifted his hand like a leader's\nbaton.  And naturally and sweetly the notes, the words of the old\ndarkey song of longing for home began to float out through the\nstillness.\n\nShe did not take her gaze from Burlingham.  She sang her best,\nsang to please him, to show him how she appreciated what he had\ndone for her.  And when she finished and bowed, the outburst of\napplause unnerved her, sent her dizzy and almost staggering into\nthe wings.  \"Splendid!  Splendid!\" cried Mabel, and Anstruther\nembraced her, and Tempest and Eshwell kissed her hands.  They all\njoined in pushing her out again for the encore--\"Blue Alsatian\nMountains.\" She did not sing quite so steadily, but got through\nin good form, the tremolo of nervousness in her voice adding to\nthe wailing pathos of the song's refrain:\n\n\n  Adé, adé, adé, such dreams must pass away,\n  But the Blue Alsatian Mountains seem to watch and wait alway.\n\n\nThe crowd clapped, stamped, whistled, shouted; but Burlingham\ndefied it.  \"The lady will sing again later,\" he cried.  \"The next\nnumber on the regular program is,\" etc., etc.  The crowd yelled;\nBurlingham stood firm, and up went the curtain on Eshwell and\nConnemora's sketch.  It got no applause.  Nor did any other\nnumbers on the program.  The contrast between the others and the\nbeauty of the girl, her delicate sweetness, her vital youth, her\nfreshness of the early morning flower, was inevitable.\n\nThe crowd could think only of her.  The quality of magnetism\naside, she had sung neither very well nor very badly.  But had\nshe sung badly, still her beauty would have won her the same\ntriumph.  When she came on for her second number with a\ncloud-like azure chiffon flung carelessly over her dark hair as\na scarf, Spanish fashion, she received a stirring welcome.  It\nfrightened her, so that Pat had to begin four times before her\nvoice faintly took up the tune.  Again Burlingham's encouraging,\nconfident gaze, flung across the gap between them like a strong\nrescuing hand, strengthened her to her task.  This time he let\nthe crowd have two encores--and the show was over; for the\nastute manager, seeing how the girl had caught on, had moved her\nsecond number to the end.\n\nBurlingham lingered in the entrance to the auditorium to feast\nhimself on the comments of the crowd as it passed out.  When he\nwent back he had to search for the girl, found her all in a heap\nin a chair at the outer edge of the forward deck.  She was\nsobbing piteously.  \"Well, for God's sake!\" cried he.  \"Is _this_\nthe way you take it!\"\n\nShe lifted her head.  \"Did I do very badly?\" she asked.\n\n\"You swept 'em off their big hulking feet,\" replied he.\n\n\"When you didn't come, I thought I'd disappointed you.\"\n\n\"I'll bet my hand there never was such a hit made in a river\nshow boat--and they've graduated some of the swells of the\nprofession.  We'll play here a week to crowded houses--matinées\nevery day, too.  And this is a two-night stand usually.  I must\nfind some more songs.\" He slapped his thigh.  \"The very thing!\"\nhe cried.  \"We'll ring in some hymns.  'Rock of Ages,' say--and\n'Jesus, Lover of my Soul'--and you can get 'em off in a churchy\nkind of costume something like a surplice.  That'll knock 'em\nstiff.  And Anstruther can dope out the accompaniments on that\nwheezer.  What d'you think?\"\n\n\"Whatever you want,\" said the girl.  \"Oh, I am so glad!\"\n\n\"I don't see how you got through so well,\" said he.\n\n\"I didn't dare fail,\" replied Susan.  \"If I had, I couldn't have\nfaced you.\" And by the light of the waning moon he saw the\npassionate gratitude of her sensitive young face.\n\n\"Oh--I've done nothing,\" said he, wiping the tears from his\neyes--for he had his full share of the impulsive, sentimental\ntemperament of his profession.  \"Pure selfishness.\"\n\nSusan gazed at him with eyes of the pure deep violet of\nstrongest feeling.  \"_I_ know what you did,\" she said in a low\nvoice.  \"And--I'd die for you.\"\n\nBurlingham had to use his handkerchief in dealing with his eyes\nnow.  \"This business has given me hysterics,\" said he with a\nqueer attempt at a laugh.  Then, after a moment, \"God bless you,\nlittle girl.  You wait here a moment.  I'll see how supper's\ngetting on.\"\n\nHe wished to go ahead of her, for he had a shrewd suspicion as\nto the state of mind of the rest of the company.  And he was\nright.  There they sat in the litter of peanut hulls, popcorn,\nand fruit skins which the audience had left.  On every\ncountenance was jealous gloom.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" inquired Burlingham in his cheerful derisive\nway.  \"You are a nice bunch, you are!\"\n\nThey shifted uneasily.  Mabel snapped out, \"Where's the infant\nprodigy?  Is she so stuck on herself already that she won't\nassociate with us?\"\n\n\"You grown-up babies,\" mocked Burlingham.  \"I found her out there\ncrying in darkness because she thought she'd failed.  Now you go\nbring her in, Conny.  As for the rest of you, I'm disgusted.  Here\nwe've hit on something that'll land us in Easy Street, and\nyou're all filled up with poison.\"\n\nThey were ashamed of themselves.  Burlingham had brought back to\nthem vividly the girl's simplicity and sweetness that had won\ntheir hearts, even the hearts of the women in whom jealousy of\nher young beauty would have been more than excusable.  Anstruther\nbegan to get out the supper dishes and Mabel slipped away toward\nthe forward deck.  \"When the child comes in,\" pursued Burlingham,\n\"I want to see you people looking and acting human.\"\n\n\"We are a lot of damn fools,\" admitted Eshwell.  \"That's why we're\nbum actors instead of doing well at some respectable business.\"\n\nAnd his jealousy went the way of Violet's and Mabel's.  Pat began\nto remember that he had shared in the triumph--where would she\nhave been without his violin work?  But Tempest remained somber.\nIn his case better nature was having a particularly hard time of\nit.  His vanity had got savage wounds from the hoots and the \"Oh,\nbite it off, hamfat,\" which had greeted his impressive lecture on\nthe magic lantern pictures.  He eyed Burlingham glumly.  He\nexonerated the girl, but not Burlingham.  He was convinced that\nthe manager, in a spirit of mean revenge, had put up a job on\nhim.  It simply could not be in the ordinary course that any\naudience, without some sly trickery of prompting from an old\nexpert of theatrical \"double-crossing,\" would be impatient for\na mere chit of an amateur when it might listen to his rich,\nmellow eloquence.\n\nSusan came shyly--and at the first glance into her face her\nassociates despised themselves for their pettiness.  It is\nimpossible for envy and jealousy and hatred to stand before the\nlight of such a nature as Susan's.  Away from her these very\nhuman friends of hers might hate her--but in her presence they\ncould not resist the charm of her sincerity.\n\nEveryone's spirits went up with the supper.  It was Pat who said\nto Burlingham, \"Bob, we're going to let the pullet in on the\nprofits equally, aren't we?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" replied Burlingham.  \"Anybody kicking?\"\n\nThe others protested enthusiastically except Tempest, who shot\na glance of fiery scorn at Burlingham over a fork laden with\npotato salad.  \"Then--you're elected, Miss Sackville,\" said\nBurlingham.\n\nSusan's puzzled eyes demanded an explanation.  \"Just this,\" said\nhe.  \"We divide equally at the end of the trip all we've raked\nin, after the rent of the boat and expenses are taken off.  You\nget your equal share exactly as if you started with us.\"\n\n\"But that wouldn't be fair,\" protested the girl.  \"I must pay\nwhat I owe you first.\"\n\n\"She means two dollars she borrowed of me at Carrollton,\"\nexplained Burlingham.  And they all laughed uproariously.\n\n\"I'll only take what's fair,\" said the girl.\n\n\"I vote we give it all to her,\" rolled out Tempest in tragedy's\ntone for classic satire.\n\nBefore Mabel could hurl at him the probably coarse retort she\ninstantly got her lips ready to make, Burlingham's cool,\npeace-compelling tones broke in:\n\n\"Miss Sackville's right.  She must get only what's fair.  She\nshares equally from tonight on--less two dollars.\"\n\nSusan nodded delightedly.  She did not know--and the others did\nnot at the excited moment recall--that the company was to date\neleven dollars less well off than when it started from the\nheadwaters of the Ohio in early June.  But Burlingham knew, and\nthat was the cause of the quiet grin to which he treated himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nBURLINGHAM had lived too long, too actively, and too\nintelligently to have left any of his large, original stock of\nthe optimism that had so often shipwrecked his career in spite\nof his talents and his energy.  Out of the bitterness of\nexperience he used to say, \"A young optimist is a young fool.  An\nold optimist is an old ass.  A fool may learn, an ass can't.\" And\nagain, \"An optimist steams through the fog, taking it for\ngranted everything's all right.  A pessimist steams ahead too,\nbut he gets ready for trouble.\" However, he was wise enough to\nkeep his private misgivings and reservations from his\nassociates; the leaders of the human race always talk optimism\nand think pessimism.  He had told the company that Susan was sure\nto make a go; and after she had made a go, he announced the\nbeginning of a season of triumph.  But he was surprised when his\nprediction came true and they had to turn people away from the\nnext afternoon's performance.  He began to believe they really\ncould stay a week, and hired a man to fill the streets of New\nWashington and other inland villages and towns of the county\nwith a handbill headlining Susan.\n\nThe news of the lovely young ballad singer in the show boat at\nBethlehem spread, as interesting news ever does, and down came\nthe people to see and hear, and to go away exclaiming.\nBethlehem, the sleepy, showed that it could wake when there was\nanything worth waking for.  Burlingham put on the hymns in the\nmiddle of the week, and even the clergy sent their families.\nEvery morning Susan, either with Mabel or with Burlingham, or\nwith both, took a long walk into the country.  It was Burlingham,\nby the way, who taught her the necessity of regular and\nmethodical long walks for the preservation of her health.  When\nshe returned there was always a crowd lounging about the landing\nwaiting to gape at her and whisper.  It was intoxicating to her,\nthis delicious draught of the heady wine of fame; and Burlingham\nwas not unprepared for the evidences that she thought pretty\nwell of herself, felt that she had arrived.  He laughed to\nhimself indulgently.  \"Let the kiddie enjoy herself,\" thought he.\n\"She needs the self-confidence now to give her a good foundation\nto stand on.  Then when she finds out what a false alarm this jay\nexcitement was, she'll not be swept clean away into despair.\"\n\nThe chief element in her happiness, he of course knew nothing\nabout.  Until this success--which she, having no basis for\ncomparison, could not but exaggerate--she had been crushed and\nabused more deeply than she had dared admit to herself by her\nbirth which made all the world scorn her and by the series of\ncalamities climaxing in that afternoon and night of horror at\nFerguson's.  This success--it seemed to her to give her the right\nto have been born, the right to live on and hold up her head\nwithout effort after Ferguson.  \"I'll show them all, before I get\nthrough,\" she said to herself over and over again.  \"They'll be\nproud of me.  Ruth will be boasting to everyone that I'm her\ncousin.  And Sam Wright--he'll wonder that he ever dared touch\nsuch a famous, great woman.\" She only half believed this\nherself, for she had much common sense and small\nself-confidence.  But pretending that she believed it all gave\nher the most delicious pleasure.\n\nBurlingham took such frank joy in her innocent vanity--so far as\nhe understood it and so far as she exhibited it--that the others\nwere good-humored about it too--all the others except Tempest,\nwhom conceit and defeat had long since soured through and\nthrough.  A tithe of Susan's success would have made him\nunbearable, for like most human beings he had a vanity that was\nAtlantosaurian on starvation rations and would have filled the\nwhole earth if it had been fed a few crumbs.  Small wonder that\nwe are ever eagerly on the alert for signs of vanity in others;\nwe are seeking the curious comfort there is in the feeling that\nothers have our own weakness to a more ridiculous degree.\nTempest twitched to jeer openly at Susan, whose exhibition was\nreally timid and modest and not merely excusable but\njustifiable.  But he dared go no further than holding haughtily\naloof and casting vaguely into the air ever and anon a tragic\nsneer.  Susan would not have understood if she had seen, and did\nnot see.  She was treading the heights, her eyes upon the sky.\nShe held grave consultation with Burlingham, with Violet, with\nMabel, about improving her part.  She took it all very, very\nseriously--and Burlingham was glad of that.  \"Yes, she does take\nherself seriously,\" he admitted to Anstruther.  \"But that won't\ndo any harm as she's so young, and as she takes her work\nseriously, too.  The trouble about taking oneself seriously is it\nstops growth.  She hasn't got that form of it.\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Violet.\n\n\"She'll wake from her little dream, poor child, long before the\nfatal stage.\" And he heaved a sigh for his own lost\nillusions--those illusions that had cost him so dear.\n\nBurlingham had intended to make at least one stop before\nJeffersonville, the first large town on the way down.  But\nSusan's capacities as a house-filler decided him for pushing\nstraight for it.  \"We'll go where there's a big population to be\ndrawn on,\" said he.  But he did not say that in the back of his\nhead there was forming a plan to take a small theater at\nJeffersonville if the girl made a hit there.\n\nEshwell, to whom he was talking, looked glum.  \"She's going\npretty good with these greenies,\" observed he.  \"But I've my\ndoubts whether city people'll care for anything so milk-like.\"\n\nBurlingham had his doubts, too; but he retorted warmly:  \"Don't\nyou believe it, Eshie.  City's an outside.  Underneath, there's\nstill the simple, honest, grassy-green heart of the country.\"\n\nEshwell laughed.  \"So you've stopped jeering at jays.  You've\nforgotten what a lot of tightwads and petty swindlers they are.\nWell, I don't blame you.  Now that they're giving down to us so\nfreely, I feel better about them myself.  It's a pity we can't\nlower the rest of the program to the level of their intellectuals.\"\n\nBurlingham was not tactless enough to disturb Eshwell's\nconsoling notion that while Susan was appreciated by these\nignorant country-jakes, the rest of the company were too subtle\nand refined in their art.  \"That's a good idea,\" replied he.\n\"I'll try to get together some simple slop.  Perhaps a melodrama,\na good hot one, would go--eh?\"\n\nAfter ten days the receipts began to drop.  On the fifteenth day\nthere was only a handful at the matinée, and in the evening half\nthe benches were empty.  \"About milked dry,\" said Burlingham at\nthe late supper.  \"We'll move on in the morning.\"\n\nThis pleased everyone.  Susan saw visions of bigger triumphs; the\nothers felt that they were going where dramatic talent, not to\nsay genius, would be at least not entirely unappreciated.  So the\ncompany was at its liveliest next morning as the\nmosquito-infested willows of the Bethlehem shore slowly dropped\naway.  They had made an unusually early start, for the river\nwould be more and more crowded as they neared the three\nclose-set cities--Louisville, Jeffersonville, and New Albany,\nand the helpless little show boat must give the steamers no\nexcuse for not seeing her.  All day--a long, dreamy, summer\nday--they drifted lazily downstream, and, except Tempest, all\ngrew gayer and more gay.  Burlingham had announced that there\nwere three hundred and seventy-eight dollars in the japanned tin\nbox he kept shut up in his bag.\n\nAt dusk a tug, for three dollars, nosed them into a wharf which\nadjoined the thickly populated labor quarter of Jeffersonville.\n\n\nSusan was awakened by a scream.  Even as she opened her eyes a\ndark cloud, a dull suffocating terrifying pain, descended upon\nher.  When she again became conscious, she was lying upon a mass\nof canvas on the levee with three strange men bending over her.\nShe sat up, instinctively caught together the front of the\nnightdress she had bought in Bethlehem the second day there.\nThen she looked wildly from face to face.\n\n\"You're all right, ma'am,\" said one of the men.  \"Not a\nscratch--only stunned.\"\n\n\"What was it?\" said the girl.  \"Where are they?\"\n\nAs she spoke, she saw Burlingham in his nightshirt propped\nagainst a big blue oil barrel.  He was staring stupidly at the\nground.  And now she noted the others scattered about the levee,\neach with a group around him or her.  \"What was it?\" she repeated.\n\n\"A tug butted its tow of barges into you,\" said someone.\n\"Crushed your boat like an eggshell.\"\n\nBurlingham staggered to his feet, stared round, saw her.  \"Thank\nGod!\" he cried.  \"Anyone drowned?  Anyone hurt?\"\n\n\"All saved--no bones broken,\" someone responded.\n\n\"And the boat?\"\n\n\"Gone down.  Nothing left of her but splinters.  The barges were\nfull of coal and building stone.\"\n\n\"The box!\" suddenly shouted Burlingham.  \"The box!\"\n\n\"What kind of a box?\" asked a boy with lean, dirty, and much\nscratched bare legs.  \"A little black tin box like they keep\nmoney in?\"\n\n\"That's it.  Where is it?\"\n\n\"It's all right,\" said the boy.  \"One of your people, a black\nactor-looking fellow----\"\n\n\"Tempest,\" interjected Burlingham.  \"Go on.\"\n\n\"He dressed on the wharf and he had the box.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"He said he was going for a doctor.  Last I seed of him he was up\nto the corner yonder.  He was movin' fast.\"\n\nBurlingham gave a kind of groan.  Susan read in his face his\nfear, his suspicion--the suspicion he was ashamed of himself for\nhaving.  She noted vaguely that he talked with the policeman\naside for a few minutes, after which the policeman went up the\nlevee.  Burlingham rejoined his companions and took command.  The\nfirst thing was to get dressed as well as might be from such of\nthe trunks as had been knocked out of the cabin by the barge and\nhad been picked up.  They were all dazed.  Even Burlingham could\nnot realize just what had occurred.  They called to one another\nmore or less humorous remarks while they were dressing behind\npiles of boxes, crates, barrels and sacks in the wharf-boat.  And\nthey laughed gayly when they assembled.  Susan made the best\nappearance, for her blue serge suit had been taken out dry when\nshe herself was lifted from the sinking wreck; the nightgown\nserved as a blouse.  Mabel's trunk had been saved.  Violet could\nwear none of her things, as they were many sizes too small, so\nshe appeared in a property skirt of black paper muslin, a black\nvelvet property basque, a pair of shoes belonging to Tempest.\nBurlingham and Eshwell made a fairly respectable showing in\nclothing from Tempest's trunk.  Their own trunks had gone down.\n\n\"Why, where's Tempest?\" asked Eshwell.\n\n\"He'll be back in a few minutes,\" replied Burlingham.  \"In fact,\nhe ought to be back now.\" His glance happened to meet Susan's;\nhe hastily shifted his eyes.\n\n\"Where's the box?\" asked Violet.\n\n\"Tempest's taking care of it,\" was the manager's answer.\n\n\"Tempest!\" exclaimed Mabel.  Her shrewd, dissipated eyes\ncontracted with suspicion.\n\n\"Anybody got any money?\" inquired Eshwell, as he fished in his pockets.\n\nNo one had a cent.  Eshwell searched Tempest's trunk, found a\ntwo-dollar bill and a one wrapped round a silver dollar and\nwadded in among some ragged underclothes.  Susan heard Burlingham\nmutter \"Wonder how he happened to overlook that!\" But no one\nelse heard.\n\n\"Well, we might have breakfast,\" suggested Mabel.\n\nThey went out on the water deck of the wharf-boat, looked down\nat the splinters of the wreck lying in the deep yellow river.\n\"Come on,\" said Burlingham, and he led the way up the levee.\nThere was no attempt at jauntiness; they all realized now.\n\n\"How about Tempest?\" said Eshwell, stopping short halfway up.\n\n\"Tempest--hell!\" retorted Mabel.  \"Come on.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" cried Violet, whose left eye was almost\nclosed by a bruise.\n\n\"We'll not see him again.  Come on.\"\n\n\"Bob!\" shrieked Violet at Burlingham.  \"Do you hear that?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said he.  \"Keep calm, and come on.\"\n\n\"Aren't you going to _do_ anything?\" she screamed, seizing him by\nthe coat tail.  \"You must, damn it--you must!\"\n\n\"I got the policeman to telephone headquarters,\" said\nBurlingham.  \"What else can be done?  Come on.\"\n\nAnd a moment later the bedraggled and dejected company filed\ninto a cheap levee restaurant.  \"Bring some coffee,\" Burlingham\nsaid to the waiter.  Then to the others, \"Does anybody want\nanything else?\" No one spoke.  \"Coffee's all,\" he said to the waiter.\n\nIt came, and they drank it in silence, each one's brain busy\nwith the disaster from the standpoint of his own resulting ruin.\nSusan glanced furtively at each face in turn.  She could not\nthink of her own fate, there was such despair in the faces of\nthese others.  Mabel looked like an old woman.  As for Violet,\nevery feature of her homeliness, her coarseness, her dissipated\npremature old age stood forth in all its horror.  Susan's heart\ncontracted and her flesh crept as she glanced quickly away.  But\nshe still saw, and it was many a week before she ceased to see\nwhenever Violet's name came into her mind.  Burlingham, too,\nlooked old and broken.  Eshwell and Pat, neither of whom had ever\nhad the smallest taste of success, were stolid, like cornered\ncurs taking their beating and waiting in silence for the blows\nto stop.\n\n\"Here, Eshie,\" said the manager, \"take care of the three\ndollars.\" And he handed him the bills.  \"I'll pay for the coffee\nand keep the change.  I'm going down to the owners of that tug\nand see what I can do.\"\n\nWhen he had paid they followed him out.  At the curbstone he\nsaid, \"Keep together somewhere round the wharf-boat.  So long.\"\nHe lifted the battered hat he was wearing, smiled at Susan.\n\"Cheer up, Miss Sackville.  We'll down 'em yet!\" And away he\nwent--a strange figure, his burly frame squeezed into a dingy\nold frock suit from among Tempest's costumes.\n\nA dreary two hours, the last half-hour in a drizzling rain from\nwhich the narrow eaves of the now closed and locked wharf-boat\nsheltered them only a little.  \"There he comes!\" cried Susan; and\nsure enough, Burlingham separated from the crowd streaming along\nthe street at the top of the levee, and began to descend the\nslope toward them.  They concentrated on his face, hoping to get\nsome indication of what to expect; but he never permitted his\nface to betray his mind.  He strode up the plank and joined them.\n\n\"Tempest come?\" he asked.\n\n\"Tempest!\" cried Mabel.  \"Haven't I told you he's jumped?  Don't\nyou suppose _I_ know him?\"\n\n\"And you brought him into the company,\" raged Violet.\n\"Burlingham didn't want to take him.  He looked the fool and\njackass he is.  Why didn't you warn us he was a rotten thief, too?\"\n\n\"Wasn't it for shoplifting you served six months in Joliet?\"\nretorted Mabel.\n\n\"You lie--you streetwalker!\" screamed Violet.\n\n\"Ladies!  Ladies!\" said Eshwell.\n\n\"That's what _I_ say,\" observed Pat.\n\n\"I'm no lady,\" replied Mabel.  \"I'm an actress.\"\n\n\"An actress--he-he!\" jeered Violet.  \"An actress!\"\n\n\"Shut up, all of you,\" commanded Burlingham.  \"I've got some\nmoney.  I settled for cash.\"\n\n\"How much?\" cried Mabel and Violet in the same breath, their\nquarrel not merely finished but forgotten.\n\n\"Three hundred dollars.\"\n\n\"For the boat and all?\" demanded Eshwell.  \"Why, Bob----\"\n\n\"They think it was for boat and all,\" interrupted Burlingham\nwith his cynical smile.  \"They set out to bully and cheat me.\nThey knew I couldn't get justice.  So I let 'em believe I owned\nthe boat--and I've got fifty apiece for us.\"\n\n\"Sixty,\" said Violet.\n\n\"Fifty.  There are six of us.\"\n\n\"You don't count in this little Jonah here, do you?\" cried\nViolet, scowling evilly at Susan.\n\n\"No--no--don't count me in,\" begged Susan.  \"I didn't lose anything.\"\n\nMabel pinched her arm.  \"You're right, Mr. Burlingham,\" said\nshe.  \"Miss Sackville ought to share.  We're all in the same box.\"\n\n\"Miss Sackville will share,\" said Burlingham.  \"There's going to\nbe no skunking about this, as long as I'm in charge.\"\n\nEshwell and Pat sided with Violet.  While the rain streamed, the\nfive, with Susan a horrified onlooker, fought on and on about\nthe division of the money.  Their voices grew louder.  They hurled\nthe most frightful epithets at one another.  Violet seized Mabel\nby the hair, and the men interfered, all but coming to blows\nthemselves in the mêlée.  The wharfmaster rushed from his office,\ndrove them off to the levee.  They continued to yell and curse,\neven Burlingham losing control of himself and releasing all\nthere was of the tough and the blackguard in his nature.  Two\npolicemen came, calmed them with threat of arrest.  At last\nBurlingham took from his pocket one at a time three small rolls\nof bills.  He flung one at each of the three who were opposing\nhis division.  \"Take that, you dirty curs,\" he said.  \"And be glad\nI'm giving you anything at all.  Most managers wouldn't have come\nback.  Come on, Miss Sackville.  Come on, Mabel.\" And the two\nfollowed him up the levee, leaving the others counting their shares.\n\nAt the street corner they went into a general store where\nBurlingham bought two ninety-eight-cent umbrellas.  He gave Mabel\none, held the other over Susan and himself as they walked along.\n\"Well, ladies,\" said he, \"we begin life again.  A clean slate, a\nfresh start--as if nothing had ever happened.\"\n\nSusan looked at him to try to give him a grateful and\nsympathetic smile.  She was surprised to see that, so far as she\ncould judge, he had really meant the words he had spoken.\n\n\"Yes, I mean it,\" said he.  \"Always look at life as it is--as a\ngame.  With every deal, whether you win or lose, your stake\ngrows--for your stake's your wits, and you add to 'em by\nlearning something with each deal.  What are you going to do, Mabel?\"\n\n\"Get some clothes.  The water wrecked mine and this rain has\nfinished my hat.\"\n\n\"We'll go together,\" said Burlingham.\n\nThey took a car for Louisville, descended before a department\nstore.  Burlingham had to fit himself from the skin out; Mabel\nhad underclothes, needed a hat, a dress, summer shoes.  Susan\nneeded underclothes, shoes, a hat, for she was bareheaded.  They\narranged to meet at the first entrance down the side street;\nBurlingham gave Susan and Mabel each their fifty dollars and\nwent his way.  When they met again in an hour and a half, they\nburst into smiles of delight.  Burlingham had transformed himself\ninto a jaunty, fashionable young middle-aged man, with an air of\nsuccess achieved and prosperity assured.  He had put the fine\nfinishing touch to his transformation by getting a haircut and\na shave.  Mabel looked like a showy chorus girl, in a striped\nblue and white linen suit, a big beflowered hat, and a fluffy\nblouse of white chiffon.  Susan had resisted Mabel's entreaties,\nhad got a plain, sensible linen blouse of a kind that on a pinch\nmight be washed out and worn without ironing.  Her new hat was a\nsimple blue sailor with a dark blue band that matched her dress.\n\n\"I spent thirty-six dollars,\" said Burlingham.\n\n\"I only spent twenty-two,\" declared Mabel.  \"And this child here\nonly parted with seven of her dollars. I had no idea she was so\nthrifty.\"\n\n\"And now--what?\" said Burlingham.\n\n\"I'm going round to see a friend of mine,\" replied Mabel.  \"She's\non the stage, too.  There's sure to be something doing at the\nsummer places.  Maybe I can ring Miss Sackville in.  There ought\nto be a good living in those eyes of hers and those feet and\nankles.  I'm sure I can put her next to something.\"\n\n\"Then you can give her your address,\" said Burlingham.\n\n\"Why, she's going with me,\" cried Mabel.  \"You don't suppose I'd\nleave the child adrift?\"\n\n\"No, she's going with me to a boarding house I'll find for her,\"\nsaid Burlingham.\n\nInto Mabel's face flashed the expression of the suspicion such\na statement would at once arouse in a mind trained as hers had\nbeen.  Burlingham's look drove the expression out of her face,\nand suspicion at least into the background.  \"She's not going\nwith your friend,\" said Burlingham, a hint of sternness in his\nvoice.  \"That's best--isn't it?\"\n\nMiss Connemora's eyes dropped.  \"Yes, I guess it is,\" replied\nshe.  \"Well--I turn down this way.\"\n\n\"We'll keep on and go out Chestnut Street,\" said Burlingham.\n\"You can write to her--or to me--care of the General Delivery.\"\n\n\"That's best.  You may hear from Tempest.  You can write me there,\ntoo.\" Mabel was constrained and embarrassed.  \"Good-by, Miss\nSackville.\"\n\nSusan embraced and kissed her.  Mabel began to weep.  \"Oh, it's\nall so sudden--and frightful,\" she said.  \"Do try to be good,\nLorna.  You can trust Bob.\" She looked earnestly, appealingly, at\nhim.  \"Yes, I'm sure you can.  And--he's right about me.  Good-by.\"\nShe hurried away, not before Susan had seen the tears falling\nfrom her kind, fast-fading eyes.\n\nSusan stood looking after her.  And for the first time the truth\nabout the catastrophe came to her.  She turned to Burlingham.\n\"How brave you are!\" she cried.\n\n\"Oh, what'd be the use in dropping down and howling like a dog?\"\nreplied he.  \"That wouldn't bring the boat back.  It wouldn't get\nme a job.\"\n\n\"And you shared equally, when you lost the most of all.\"\n\nThey were walking on.  \"The boat was mine, too,\" said he in a dry\nreflective tone.  \"I told 'em it wasn't when we started out\nbecause I wanted to get a good share for rent and so on, without\nany kicking from anybody.\"\n\nThe loss did not appeal to her; it was the lie he had told.  She\nfelt her confidence shaking.  \"You didn't mean to--to----\" she\nfaltered, stopped.\n\n\"To cheat them?\" suggested he.  \"Yes, I did.  So--to sort of\nbalance things up I divided equally all I got from the tug\npeople.  What're you looking so unhappy about?\"\n\n\"I wish you hadn't told me,\" she said miserably.  \"I don't see\nwhy you did.\"\n\n\"Because I don't want you making me into a saint.  I'm like the\nrest you see about in pants, cheating and lying, with or without\npretending to themselves that they're honest.  Don't trust\nanybody, my dear.  The sooner you get over the habit, the sooner\nyou'll cease to tempt people to be hypocrites.  All the serious\ntrouble I've ever got into has come through trusting or being\ntrusted.\"\n\nHe looked gravely at her, burst out laughing at her perplexed,\nalarmed expression.  \"Oh, Lord, it isn't as bad as all that,\"\nsaid he.  \"The rain's stopped.  Let's have breakfast.  Then--a new\ndeal--with everything to gain and nothing to lose.  It's a great\nadvantage to be in a position where you've got nothing to lose!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nBURLINGHAM found for her a comfortable room in a flat in West\nChestnut Street--a respectable middle-class neighborhood with\nthree churches in full view and the spires of two others visible\nover the housetops.  Her landlady was Mrs. Redding, a\nsimple-hearted, deaf old widow with bright kind eyes beaming\nguilelessness through steel-framed spectacles.  Mrs. Redding had\nonly recently been reduced to the necessity of letting a room.\nShe stated her moderate price--seven dollars a week for room and\nboard--as if she expected to be arrested for attempted\nextortion.  \"I give good meals,\" she hastened to add.  \"I do the\ncooking myself--and buy the best.  I'm no hand for canned stuff.\nAs for that there cold storage, it's no better'n slow poison,\nand not so terrible slow at that.  Anything your daughter wants\nI'll give her.\"\n\n\"She's not my daughter,\" said Burlingham, and it was his turn to\nbe red and flustered.  \"I'm simply looking after her, as she's\nalone in the world.  I'm going to live somewhere else.  But I'll\ncome here for meals, if you're willing, ma'am.\"\n\n\"I--I'd have to make that extry, I'm afraid,\" pleaded Mrs. Redding.\n\n\"Rather!\" exclaimed Burlingham.  \"I eat like a pair of Percherons.\"\n\n\"How much did you calculate to pay?\" inquired the widow.  Her one\neffort at price fixing, though entirely successful, had\nexhausted her courage.\n\nBurlingham was clear out of his class in those idyllic days of\nprotector of innocence.  He proceeded to be more than honest.\n\n\"Oh, say five a week.\"\n\n\"Gracious!  That's too much,\" protested she.  \"I hate to charge a\nbody for food, somehow.  It don't seem to be accordin' to what\nGod tells us.  But I don't see no way out.\"\n\n\"I'll come for five not a cent less,\" insisted Burlingham.  \"I\nwant to feel free to eat as much as I like.\" And it was so\narranged.  Away he went to look up his acquaintances, while Susan\nsat listening to the widow and trying to convince her that she\nand Mr. Burlingham didn't want and couldn't possibly eat all\nthe things she suggested as suitable for a nice supper.  Susan\nhad been learning rapidly since she joined the theatrical\nprofession.  She saw why this fine old woman was getting poorer\nsteadily, was arranging to spend her last years in an almshouse.\nWhat a queer world it was!  What a strange way for a good God to\norder things!  The better you were, the worse off you were.  No\ndoubt it was Burlingham's lifelong goodness of heart as shown in\nhis generosity to her, that had kept him down.  It was the same\nway with her dead mother--she had been loving and trusting, had\ngiven generously without thought of self, with generous\nconfidence in the man she loved--and had paid with reputation\nand life.\n\nShe compelled Burlingham to take what was left of her fifty\ndollars.  \"You wouldn't like to make me feel mean,\" was the\nargument she used.  \"I must put in what I've got--the same as you\ndo.  Now, isn't that fair?\" And as he was dead broke and had been\nunable to borrow, he did not oppose vigorously.\n\nShe assumed that after a day or two spent in getting his\nbearings he would take her with him as he went looking.  When she\nsuggested it, he promptly vetoed it.  \"That isn't the way\nbusiness is done in the profession,\" said he.  \"The star--you're\nthe star--keeps in the background, and her manager--that's me\ndoes the hustling.\"\n\nShe had every reason for believing this; but as the days passed\nwith no results, sitting about waiting began to get upon her\nnerves.  Mrs. Redding had the remnant of her dead husband's\nlibrary, and he had been a man of broad taste in literature.  But\nSusan, ardent reader though she was, could not often lose\nherself in books now.  She was too impatient for realities, too\nanxious about them.\n\nBurlingham remained equable, neither hopeful nor gloomy; he made\nher feel that he was strong, and it gave her strength.  Thus she\nwas not depressed when on the last day of their week he said:  \"I\nthink we'd better push on to Cincinnati tomorrow.  There's\nnothing here, and we've got to get placed before our cash gives\nout.  In Cincinnati there are a dozen places to one in this snide town.\"\n\nThe idea of going to Cincinnati gave her a qualm of fear; but\nit passed away when she considered how she had dropped out of\nthe world.  \"They think I'm dead,\" she reflected.  \"Anyhow, I'd\nnever be looked for among the kind of people I'm in with now.\"\nThe past with which she had broken seemed so far away and so dim\nto her that she could not but feel it must seem so to those who\nknew her in her former life.  She had such a sense of her own\ninsignificance, now that she knew something of the vastness and\nbusiness of the world, that she was without a suspicion of the\nhuge scandal and excitement her disappearance had caused in\nSutherland.\n\nTo Cincinnati they went next day by the L. and N. and took two\ntiny rooms in the dingy old Walnut Street House, at a special\nrate--five dollars a week for the two, as a concession to the\nprofession.  \"We'll eat in cheap restaurants and spread our\ncapital out,\" said Burlingham.  \"I want you to get placed _right_,\nnot just placed.\" He bought a box of blacking and a brush,\ninstructed her in the subtle art of making a front--an art\nwhereof he was past master, as Susan had long since learned.\n\"Never let yourself look poor or act poor, until you simply have\nto throw up the sponge,\" said he.  \"The world judges by\nappearances.  Put your first money and your last into clothes.\nAnd never--never--tell a hard-luck story.  Always seem to be\ndoing well and comfortably looking out for a chance to do\nbetter.  The whole world runs from seedy people and whimperers.\"\n\n\"Am I--that way?\" she asked nervously.\n\n\"Not a bit,\" declared he.  \"The day you came up to me in\nCarrollton I knew you were playing in the hardest kind of hard\nluck because of what I had happened to see and hear--and guess.\nBut you weren't looking for pity--and that was what I liked.  And\nit made me feel you had the stuff in you.  I'd not waste breath\nteaching a whiner or a cheap skate.  You couldn't be cheap if you\ntried.  The reason I talk to you about these things is so you'll\nlearn to put the artistic touches by instinct into what you do.\"\n\n\"You've taken too much trouble for me,\" said the girl.\n\"Don't you believe it, my dear,\" laughed he.  \"If I can do with\nyou what I hope--I've an instinct that if I win out for you, I'll\ncome into my own at last.\"\n\n\"You've taught me a lot,\" said she.\n\n\"I wonder,\" replied he.  \"That is, I wonder how much you've\nlearned.  Perhaps enough to keep you--not to keep from being\nknocked down by fate, but to get on your feet afterward.  I hope\nso--I hope so.\"\n\nThey dropped coffee, bought milk by the bottle, he smuggling it\nto their rooms disguised as a roll of newspapers.  They carried\nin rolls also, and cut down their restaurant meals to supper\nwhich they got for twenty-five cents apiece at a bakery\nrestaurant in Seventh Street.  There is a way of resorting to\nthese little economies--a snobbish, self-despairing way--that\nmakes them sordid and makes the person indulging in them sink\nlower and lower.  But Burlingham could not have taken that way.\nHe was the adventurer born, was a hardy seasoned campaigner who\nhad never looked on life in the snob's way, had never felt the\nimpulse to apologize for his defeats or to grow haughty over his\nsuccesses.  Susan was an apt pupil; and for the career that lay\nbefore her his instructions were invaluable.  He was teaching her\nhow to keep the craft afloat and shipshape through the worst\nweather that can sweep the sea of life.\n\n\"How do you make yourself look always neat and clean?\" he asked.\n\nShe confessed:  \"I wash out my things at night and hang them on\nthe inside of the shutters to dry.  They're ready to wear again\nin the morning.\"\n\n\"Getting on!\" cried he, full of admiration.  \"They simply can't\ndown us, and they might as well give up trying.\"\n\n\"But I don't look neat,\" sighed she.  \"I can't iron.\"\n\n\"No--that's the devil of it,\" laughed he.  He pulled aside his\nwaistcoat and she saw he was wearing a dickey.  \"And my cuffs are\npinned in,\" he said.  \"I have to be careful about raising and\nlowering my arms.\"\n\n\"Can't I wash out some things for you?\" she said, then hurried\non to put it more strongly.  \"Yes, give them to me when we get\nback to the hotel.\"\n\n\"It does help a man to feel he's clean underneath.  And we've got\nnothing to waste on laundries.\"\n\n\"I wish I hadn't spent that fifteen cents to have my heels\nstraightened and new steels put in them.\" She had sat in a\ncobbler's while this repair to the part of her person she was\nmost insistent upon had been effected.\n\nHe laughed.  \"A good investment, that,\" said he.  \"I've been\nnoticing how you always look nice about the feet.  Keep it up.\nThe surest sign of a sloven and a failure, of a moral, mental,\nand physical no-good is down-at-the-heel.  Always keep your heels\nstraight, Lorna.\"\n\nAnd never had he given her a piece of advice more to her liking.\nShe thought she knew now why she had always been so particular\nabout her boots and shoes, her slippers and her stockings.  He\nhad given her a new confidence in herself--in a strength within her\nsomewhere beneath the weakness she was always seeing and feeling.\n\nNot until she thought it out afterward did she realize what they\nwere passing through, what frightful days of failure he was\nenduring.  He acted like the steady-nerved gambler at life that\nhe was.  He was not one of those more or less weak losers who\nhave to make desperate efforts to conceal a fainting heart.  His\nheart was not fainting.  He simply played calmly on, feeling that\nthe next throw was as likely to be for as against him.  She kept\nclose to her room, walking about there--she had never been much\nof a sitter--thinking, practicing the new songs he had got for\nher--character songs in which he trained her as well as he could\nwithout music or costume or any of the accessories.  He also had\nan idea for a church scene, with her in a choir boy's costume,\nsinging the most moving of the simple religious songs to organ\nmusic.  She from time to time urged him to take her on the rounds\nwith him.  But he stood firm, giving always the same reason of\nthe custom in the profession.  Gradually, perhaps by some form of\nthat curious process of infiltration that goes on between two\nminds long in intimate contact, the conviction came to her that\nthe reason he alleged was not his real reason; but as she had\nabsolute confidence in him she felt that there was some good\nreason or he would not keep her in the background--and that his\nsilence about it must be respected.  So she tried to hide from\nhim how weary and heartsick inaction was making her, how hard it\nwas for her to stay alone so many hours each day.\n\nAs he watched her closely, it soon dawned on him that something\nwas wrong, and after a day or so he worked out the explanation.\nHe found a remedy--the reading room of the public library where\nshe could make herself almost content the whole day long.\n\nHe began to have a haggard look, and she saw he was sick, was\nkeeping up his strength with whisky.  \"It's only this infernal\nsummer cold I caught in the smashup,\" he explained.  \"I can't\nshake it, but neither can it get me down.  I'd not dare fall\nsick.  What'd become of _us_?\"\n\nShe knew that \"us\" meant only herself.  Her mind had been aging\nrapidly in those long periods of unbroken reflection.  To develop\na human being, leave him or her alone most of the time; it is\ntoo much company, too little time to digest and assimilate, that\nkeep us thoughtless and unformed until life is half over.  She\nastonished him by suddenly announcing one evening:\n\n\"I am a drag on you.  I'm going to take a place in a store.\"\n\nHe affected an indignation so artistic that it ought to have\nbeen convincing.  \"I'm ashamed of you!\" he cried.  \"I see you're\nlosing your nerve.\"\n\nThis was ingenious, but it did not succeed.  \"You can't deceive\nme any longer,\" was her steady answer.  \"Tell me honest--couldn't\nyou have got something to do long ago, if it hadn't been for\ntrying to do something for me?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" replied he, too canny to deny the obvious.  \"But what has\nthat to do with it?  If I'd had a living offer, I'd have taken\nit.  But at my age a man doesn't dare take certain kinds of\nplaces.  It'd settle him for life.  And I'm playing for a really big\nstake and I'll win.  When I get what I want for you, we'll make as\nmuch money a month as I could make a year.  Trust me, my dear.\"\n\nIt was plausible; and her \"loss of nerve\" was visibly\naggravating his condition--the twitching of hands and face, the\nterrifying brightness of his eyes, of the color in the deep\nhollows under his cheek bones.  But she felt that she must\npersist.  \"How much money have we got?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh--a great deal enough.\"\n\n\"You must play square with me,\" said she.  \"I'm not a baby, but\na woman--and your partner.\"\n\n\"Don't worry me, child.  We'll talk about it tomorrow.\"\n\n\"How much?  You've no right to hide things from me.  You--hurt me.\"\n\n\"Eleven dollars and eighty cents--when this bill for supper's\npaid and the waitress tipped.\"\n\n\"I'll try for a place in a store,\" said she.\n\n\"Don't talk that way or think that way,\" cried he angrily.\n\"There's where so many people fail in life.  They don't stick to\ntheir game.  I wish to God I'd had sense enough to break straight\nfor Chicago or New York.  But it's too late now.  What I lack is\nnerve--nerve to do the big, bold things my brains show me I ought.\"\n\nHis distress was so obvious that she let the subject drop.  That\nnight she lay awake as she had fallen into the habit of doing.\nBut instead of purposeless, rambling thoughts, she was trying\ndefinitely to plan a search for work.  Toward three in the\nmorning she heard him tossing and muttering--for the wall\nbetween their rooms was merely plastered laths covered with\npaper.  She tried his door; it was locked.  She knocked, got no\nanswer but incoherent ravings.  She roused the office, and the\nnight porter forced the door.  Burlingham's gas was lighted; he\nwas sitting up in bed--a haggard, disheveled, insane man, raving\non and on--names of men and women she had never heard--oaths,\ndisjointed sentences.\n\n\"Brain fever, I reckon,\" said the porter.  \"I'll call a doctor.\"\n\nIn a few minutes Susan was gladdened by the sight of a young man\nwearing the familiar pointed beard and bearing the familiar\nblack bag.  He made a careful examination, asked her many\nquestions, finally said:\n\n\"Your father has typhoid, I fear.  He must be taken to a hospital.\"\n\n\"But we have very little money,\" said Susan.\n\n\"I understand,\" replied the doctor, marveling at the calmness of one\nso young.  \"The hospital I mean is free.  I'll send for an ambulance.\"\n\nWhile they were waiting beside Burlingham, whom the doctor had\ndrugged into unconsciousness with a hypodermic, Susan said:  \"Can\nI go to the hospital and take care of him?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the doctor.  \"You can only call and inquire how he\nis, until he's well enough to see you.\"\n\n\"And how long will that be?\"\n\n\"I can't say.\" He hadn't the courage to tell her it would be\nthree weeks at least, perhaps six or seven.\n\nHe got leave of the ambulance surgeon for Susan to ride to the\nhospital, and he went along himself.  As the ambulance sped\nthrough the dimly lighted streets with clanging bell and heavy\npounding of the horse's hoofs on the granite pavement, Susan\nknelt beside Burlingham, holding one of his hot hands.  She was\nremembering how she had said that she would die for him--and here\nit was he that was dying for her.  And her heart was heavy with\na load of guilt, the heaviest she was ever to feel in her life.\nShe could not know how misfortune is really the lot of human\nbeings; it seemed to her that a special curse attended her,\nstriking down all who befriended her.\n\nThey dashed up to great open doors of the hospital.  Burlingham\nwas lifted, was carried swiftly into the receiving room.  Susan\nwith tearless eyes bent over, embraced him lingeringly, kissed\nhis fiery brow, his wasted cheeks.  One of the surgeons in white\nduck touched her on the arm.\n\n\"We can't delay,\" he said.\n\n\"No indeed,\" she replied, instantly drawing back.\n\nShe watched the stretcher on wheels go noiselessly down the\ncorridor toward the elevator and when it was gone she still\ncontinued to look.  \"You can come at any hour to inquire,\" said\nthe young doctor who had accompanied her.  \"Now we'll go into the\noffice and have the slip made out.\"\n\nThey entered a small room, divided unequally by a barrier desk;\nbehind it stood a lean, coffee-sallowed young man with a scrawny\nneck displayed to the uttermost by a standing collar scarcely\ntaller than the band of a shirt.  He directed at Susan one of\nthose obtrusively shrewd glances which shallow people practice\nand affect to create the impression that they have a genius for\ncharacter reading.  He drew a pad of blank forms toward him,\nwiped a pen on the mat into which his mouse-colored hair was\nroached above his right temple.  \"Well, miss, what's the\npatient's name?\"\n\n\"Robert Burlingham.\"\n\n\"Age?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"I--I don't know.  I guess he isn't very young.  But I don't know.\"\n\n\"Put down forty, Sim,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Very well, Doctor Hamilton.\" Then to Susan:  \"Color white, I\nsuppose.  Nativity?\"\n\nSusan recalled that she had heard him speak of Liverpool as his\nbirthplace.  \"English,\" said she.\n\n\"Profession?\"\n\n\"Actor.\"\n\n\"Residence?\"\n\n\"He hasn't any.  It was sunk at Jeffersonville.  We stop at the\nWalnut Street House.\"\n\n\"Walnut Street House.  Was he married or single?\"\n\n\"Single.\" Then she recalled some of the disconnected ravings.\n\"I--I--don't know.\"\n\n\"Single,\" said the clerk.  \"No, I guess I'll put it widower.  Next\nfriend or relative?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"Daughter.  First name?\"\n\n\"I am not his daughter.\"\n\n\"Oh, niece.  Full name, please.\"\n\n\"I am no relation--just his--his friend.\"\n\nSim the clerk looked up sharply.  Hamilton reddened, glowered at\nhim.  \"I understand,\" said Sim, leering at her.  And in a tone\nthat reeked insinuation which quite escaped her, he went on,\n\"We'll put your name down.  What is it?\"\n\n\"Lorna Sackville.\"\n\n\"You don't look English--not at all the English style of beauty,\neh--Doctor?\"\n\n\"That's all, Miss Sackville,\" said Hamilton, with a scowl at the\nclerk.  Susan and he went out into Twelfth Street.  Hamilton from\ntime to time stole a glance of sympathy and inquiry into the sad\nyoung face, as he and she walked eastward together.  \"He's a\nstrong man and sure to pull through,\" said the doctor.  \"Are you\nalone at the hotel?\"\n\n\"I've nobody but him in the world,\" replied she.\n\n\"I was about to venture to advise that you go to a boarding\nhouse,\" pursued the young man.\n\n\"Thank you.  I'll see.\"\n\n\"There's one opposite the hospital--a reasonable place.\"\n\n\"I've got to go to work,\" said the girl, to herself rather than to him.\n\n\"Oh, you have a position.\"\n\nSusan did not reply, and he assumed that she had.\n\n\"If you don't mind, I'd like to call and see--Mr. Burlingham.\nThe physicians at the hospital are perfectly competent, as good\nas there are in the city.  But I'm not very busy, and I'd be\nglad to go.\"\n\n\"We haven't any money,\" said the girl.  \"And I don't know when we\nshall have.  I don't want to deceive you.\"\n\n\"I understand perfectly,\" said the young man, looking at her\nwith interested but respectful eyes.  \"I'm poor, myself, and have\njust started.\"\n\n\"Will they treat him well, when he's got no money?\"\n\n\"As well as if he paid.\"\n\n\"And you will go and see that everything's all right?\"\n\n\"It'll be a pleasure.\"\n\nUnder a gas lamp he took out a card and gave it to her.  She\nthanked him and put it in the bosom of her blouse where lay all\nthe money they had--the eleven dollars and eighty cents.  They\nwalked to the hotel, as cars were few at that hour.  He did all\nthe talking--assurances that her \"father\" could not fail to get\nwell, that typhoid wasn't anything like the serious disease it\nused to be, and that he probably had a light form of it.  The\ngirl listened, but her heart could not grow less heavy.  As he\nwas leaving her at the hotel door, he hesitated, then asked if\nshe wouldn't let him call and take her to the hospital the next\nmorning, or, rather, later that same morning.  She accepted, she\nhoped that, if he were with her, she gratefully; would be\nadmitted to see Burlingham and could assure herself that he was\nwell taken care of.\n\nThe night porter tried to detain her for a little chat.  \"Well,\"\nsaid he, \"it's a good hospital--for you folks with money.  Of\ncourse, for us poor people it's different.  You couldn't hire _me_\nto go there.\"\n\nSusan turned upon him.  \"Why not?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh, if a man's poor, or can't pay for nice quarters, they treat\nhim any old way.  Yes, they're good doctors and all that.  But\nthey're like everybody else.  They don't give a darn for poor\npeople.  But your uncle'll be all right there.\"\n\nFor the first time in her life Susan did not close her eyes in sleep.\n\n\nThe young doctor was so moved by her worn appearance that he\nimpulsively said:  \"Have you some troubles you've said nothing\nabout?  Please don't hesitate to tell me.\"\n\n\"Oh, you needn't worry about me,\" replied she.  \"I simply didn't\nsleep--that's all.  Do they treat charity patients badly at the\nhospital?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" declared he earnestly.  \"Of course, a charity\npatient can't have a room to himself.  But that's no disadvantage.\"\n\n\"How much is a room?\"\n\n\"The cheapest are ten dollars a week.  That includes private\nattendance--a little better nursing than the public patients\nget--perhaps.  But, really--Miss Sackville----\"\n\n\"He must have a room,\" said Susan.\n\n\"You are sure you can afford it?  The difference isn't----\"\n\n\"He must have a room.\" She held out a ten-dollar bill--ten\ndollars of the eleven dollars and eighty cents.  \"This'll pay for\nthe first week.  You fix it, won't you?\"\n\nYoung Doctor Hamilton hesitatingly took the money.  \"You are\nquite, quite sure, Miss Sackville?--Quite sure you can afford\nthis extravagance--for it is an extravagance.\"\n\n\"He must have the best we can afford,\" evaded she.\n\nShe waited in the office while Hamilton went up.  When he came\ndown after perhaps half an hour, he had an air of cheerfulness.\n\"Everything going nicely,\" said he.\n\nSusan's violet-gray eyes gazed straight into his brown eyes; and\nthe brown eyes dropped.  \"You are not telling me the truth,\" said she.\n\n\"I'm not denying he's a very sick man,\" protested Hamilton.\n\n\"Is he----\"\n\nShe could not pronounce the word.\n\n\"Nothing like that--believe me, nothing.  He has the chances all with him.\"\n\nAnd Susan tried to believe.  \"He will have a room?\"\n\n\"He has a room.  That's why I was so long.  And I'm glad he\nhas--for, to be perfectly honest, the attendance--not the\ntreatment, but the attendance--is much better for private\npatients.\"\n\nSusan was looking at the floor.  Presently she drew a long\nbreath, rose.  \"Well, I must be going,\" said she.  And she went to\nthe street, he accompanying her.\n\n\"If you're going back to the hotel,\" said he, \"I'm walking that way.\"\n\n\n\"No, I've got to go this way,\" replied she, looking up Elm Street.\n\nHe saw she wished to be alone, and left her with the promise to\nsee Burlingham again that afternoon and let her know at the\nhotel how he was getting on.  He went east, she north.  At the\nfirst corner she stopped, glanced back to make sure he was not\nfollowing.  From her bosom she drew four business cards.  She had\ntaken the papers from the pockets of Burlingham's clothes and\nfrom the drawer of the table in his room, to put them all\ntogether for safety; she had found these cards, the addresses\nof theatrical agents.  As she looked at them, she remembered\nBurlingham's having said that Blynn--Maurice Blynn, at Vine and\nNinth Streets--might give them something at one of the \"over the\nRhine\" music halls, as a last resort.  She noted the address, put\naway the cards and walked on, looking about for a policeman.\nSoon she came to a bridge over a muddy stream--a little river,\nshe thought at first, then remembered that it must be the\ncanal--the Rhine, as it was called, because the city's huge\nGerman population lived beyond it, keeping up the customs and\neven the language of the fatherland.  She stood on the bridge,\nwatching the repulsive waters from which arose the stench of\nsewage; watching canal boats dragged drearily by mules with\nharness-worn hides; followed with her melancholy eyes the course\nof the canal under bridge after bridge, through a lane of dirty,\nnoisy factories pouring out from lofty chimneys immense clouds\nof black smoke.  It ought to have been a bright summer day, but\nthe sun shone palely through the dense clouds; a sticky, sooty\nmoisture saturated the air, formed a skin of oily black ooze\nover everything exposed to it.  A policeman, a big German, with\nstupid honest face, brutal yet kindly, came lounging along.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Susan, \"but would you mind telling me\nwhere--\" she had forgotten the address, fumbled in her bosom for\nthe cards, showed him Blynn's card--\"how I can get to this?\"\n\nThe policeman nodded as he read the address.  \"Keep on this\nway, lady\"--he pointed his baton south--\"until you've passed\nfour streets.  At the fifth street turn east.  Go\none--two--three--four--five streets east.  Understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, thank you,\" said the girl with the politeness of deep gratitude.\n\n\"You'll be at Vine.  You'll see the name on the street lamp.\nBlynn's on the southwest corner.  Think you can find it?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I can.\"\n\n\"I'm going that way,\" continued the policeman.  \"But you'd\nbetter walk ahead.  If you walked with me, they'd think you was\npinched--and we'd have a crowd after us.\" And he laughed\nwith much shaking of his fat, tightly belted body.\n\nSusan contrived to force a smile, though the suggestion of such\na disgraceful scene made her shudder.  \"Thank you so much.  I'm\nsure I'll find it.\" And she hastened on, eager to put distance\nbetween herself and that awkward company.\n\n\"Don't mention it, lady,\" the policeman called after her, tapping\nhis baton on the rim of his helmet, as a mark of elegant courtesy.\n\nShe was not at ease until, looking back, she no longer saw the\nbluecoat for the intervening crowds.  After several slight\nmistakes in the way, she descried ahead of her a large sign\npainted on the wall of a three-story brick building:\n\n\n                 MAURICE BLYNN, THEATRICAL AGENT\n             ALL KINDS OF TALENT PLACED AND SUPPLIED\n\n\nAfter some investigation she discovered back of the saloon which\noccupied the street floor a grimy and uneven wooden staircase\nleading to the upper stories.  At the first floor she came face\nto face with a door on the glass of which was painted the same\nannouncement she had read from the wall.  She knocked timidly,\nthen louder.  A shrill voice came from the interior:\n\n\"The door's open.  Come in.\"\n\nShe turned the knob and entered a small, low-ceilinged room\nwhose general grime was streaked here and there with smears of\nsoot.  It contained a small wooden table at which sprawled a\nfreckled and undernourished office boy, and a wooden bench where\nfretted a woman obviously of \"the profession.\" She was dressed\nin masses of dirty white furbelows.  On her head reared a big\nhat, above an incredible quantity of yellow hair; on the hat\nwere badly put together plumes of badly curled ostrich feathers.\nBeneath her skirt was visible one of her feet; it was large and\nfat, was thrust into a tiny slipper with high heel ending under\nthe arch of the foot.  The face of the actress was young and\npertly pretty, but worn, overpainted, overpowdered and\nunderwashed.  She eyed Susan insolently.\n\n\"Want to see the boss?\" said the boy.\n\n\"If you please,\" murmured Susan.\n\n\"Business?\"\n\n\"I'm looking for a--for a place.\"\n\nThe boy examined her carefully.  \"Appointment?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied the girl.\n\n\"Well--he'll see you, anyhow,\" said the boy, rising.\n\nThe mass of plumes and yellow bangs and furbelows on the bench\nbecame violently agitated.  \"I'm first,\" cried the actress.\n\n\"Oh, you sit tight, Mame,\" jeered the boy.  He opened a solid\ndoor behind him.  Through the crack Susan saw busily writing at\na table desk a bald, fat man with a pasty skin and a veined and\nbulbous nose.\n\n\"Lady to see you,\" said the boy in a tone loud enough for both\nSusan and the actress to hear.\n\n\"Who?  What name?\" snapped the man, not ceasing or looking up.\n\n\"She's young, and a queen,\" said the boy.  \"Shall I show her in?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\nThe actress started up.  \"Mr. Blynn----\" she began in a loud,\nthreatening, elocutionary voice.\n\n\"'Lo, Mame,\" said Blynn, still busy.  \"No time to see you.\nNothing doing.  So long.\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Blynn----\"\n\n\"Bite it off, Mame,\" ordered the boy.  \"Walk in, miss.\"\n\nSusan, deeply colored from sympathy with the humiliated actress\nand from nervousness in those forbidding and ominous\nsurroundings, entered the private office.  The boy closed the\ndoor behind her.  The pen scratched on.  Presently the man said:\n\n\"Well, my dear, what's your name?\"\n\nWith the last word, the face lifted and Susan saw a seamed and\npitted skin, small pale blue eyes showing the white, or rather\nthe bloodshot yellow all round the iris, a heavy mouth and jaw,\nthick lips; the lower lip protruded and was decorated with a\nblue-black spot like a blood boil, as if to indicate where the\nincessant cigar usually rested.  At first glance into Susan's\nsweet, young face the small eyes sparkled and danced, traveled\non to the curves of her form.\n\n\"Do sit down, my dear,\" said he in a grotesquely wheedling\nvoice.  She took the chair close to him as it was the only one in\nthe little room.\n\n\"What can I do for you?  My, how fresh and pretty you are!\"\n\n\"Mr. Burlingham----\" began Susan.\n\n\"Oh--you're the girl Bob was talking about.\" He smiled and\nnodded at her.  \"No wonder he kept you out of sight.\" He\ninventoried her charms again with his sensual, confident glance.\n\"Bob certainly has got good taste.\"\n\n\"He's in the hospital,\" said Susan desperately.  \"So I've come to\nget a place if you can find me one.\"\n\n\"Hospital?  I'm sorry to hear that.\" And Mr. Blynn's tones had\nthat accent of deep sympathy which get a man or woman without\nfurther evidence credit for being \"kind-hearted whatever else he is.\"\n\n\"Yes, he's very ill--with typhoid,\" said the girl.  \"I must do\nsomething right away to help him.\"\n\n\"That's fine--fine,\" said Mr. Blynn in the same effective tone.\n\"I see you're as sweet as you are pretty.  Yes--that's\nfine--fine!\" And the moisture was in the little eyes.  \"Well, I\nthink I can do something for you.  I _must_ do something for you.\nHad much experience?--Professional, I mean.\"\n\nMr. Blynn laughed at his, to Susan, mysterious joke.  Susan\nsmiled faintly in polite response.  He rubbed his hands and\nsmacked his lips, the small eyes dancing.  The moisture had vanished.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I can place you, if you can do anything at all,\" he\nwent on.  \"I'd 'a' done it long ago, if Bob had let me see you.\nBut he was too foxy.  He ought to be ashamed of himself, standing\nin the way of your getting on, just out of jealousy.  Sing or\ndance--or both?\"\n\n\"I can sing a little, I think,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Now, that's modest.  Ever worn tights?\"\n\nSusan shook her head, a piteous look in her violet-gray eyes.\n\n\"Oh, you'll soon get used to that.  And mighty well you'll look\nin 'em, I'll bet, eh?  Where did Bob get you?  And when?\" Before\nshe could answer, he went on, \"Let's see, I've got a date for\nthis evening, but I'll put it off.  And she's a peach, too.  So\nyou see what a hit you've made with me.  We'll have a nice little\ndinner at the Hotel du Rhine and talk things over.\"\n\n\"Couldn't I go to work right away?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"Sure.  I'll have you put on at Schaumer's tomorrow night----\"\nHe looked shrewdly, laughingly, at her, with contracted eyelids.\n\"_If_ everything goes well.  Before I do anything for you, I have\nto see what you can do for me.\" And he nodded and smacked his\nlips.  \"Oh, we'll have a lovely little dinner!\" He looked\nexpectantly at her.  \"You certainly are a queen!  What a dainty\nlittle hand!\" He reached out one of his hands--puffy as if it\nhad been poisoned, very white, with stubby fingers.  Susan\nreluctantly yielded her hand to his close, mushy embrace.  \"No\nrings.  That's a shame, petty----\"  He was talking as if to a\nbaby.--\"That'll have to be fixed--yes, it will, my little\nsweetie.  My, how nice and fresh you are!\" And his great\nnostrils, repulsively hairy within, deeply pitted without,\nsniffed as if over an odorous flower.\n\nSusan drew her hand away.  \"What will they give me?\" she asked.\n\n\"How greedy it is!\" he wheedled.  \"Well, you'll get plenty--plenty.\"\n\n\"How much?\" said the girl.  \"Is it a salary?\"\n\n\"Of course, there's the regular salary.  But that won't amount to\nmuch.  You know how those things are.\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Oh, say a dollar a night--until you make a hit.\"\n\n\"Six dollars a week.\"\n\n\"Seven.  This is a Sunday town.  Sunday's the big day.  You'll have\nWednesday, Saturday and Sunday matinées, but they don't pay for them.\"\n\n\"Seven dollars a week.\" And the hospital wanted ten.  \"Couldn't\nI get--about fifteen--or fourteen?  I think I could do on fourteen.\"\n\n\"Rather!  I was talking only of the salary.  You'll make a good\nmany times fifteen--if you play your cards right.  It's true\nSchaumer draws only a beer crowd.  But as soon as the word flies\nround that _you_'re there, the boys with the boodle'll flock in.\nOh, you'll wear the sparklers all right, pet.\"\n\nRather slowly it was penetrating to Susan what Mr. Blynn had in\nmind.  \"I'd--I'd rather take a regular salary,\" said she.  \"I must\nhave ten a week for him.  I can live any old way.\"\n\n\"Oh, come off!\" cried Mr. Blynn with a wink.  \"What's your game?\nAnyhow, don't play it on me.  You understand that you can't get\nsomething for nothing.  It's all very well to love your friend\nand be true to him.  But he can't expect--he'll not ask you to\nqueer yourself.  That sort of thing don't go in the profession. . . .\nCome now, I'm willing to set you on your feet, give you a\ngood start, if you'll play fair with me--show appreciation.  Will\nyou or won't you?\"\n\n\"You mean----\" began Susan, and paused there, looking at him\nwith grave questioning eyes.\n\nHis own eyes shifted.  \"Yes, I mean that.  I'm a business man, not\na sentimentalist.  I don't want love.  I've got no time for it.\nBut when it comes to giving a girl of the right sort a square\ndeal and a good time, why you'll find I'm as good as there is\ngoing.\"  He reached for her hands again, his empty, flabby chin\nbags quivering.  \"I want to help Bob, and I want to help you.\"\n\nShe rose slowly, pushing her chair back.  She understood now why\nBurlingham had kept her in the background, why his quest had\nbeen vain, why it had fretted him into mortal illness.\n\"I--couldn't do that,\" she said.  \"I'm sorry, but I couldn't.\"\n\nHe looked at her in a puzzled way.  \"You belong to Bob, don't you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You mean you're straight--a good girl?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe was half inclined to believe her, so impressive was her quiet\nnatural way, in favorable contrast to the noisy protests of\nwomen posing as virtuous.  \"Well--if that's so--why you'd better\ndrop out of the profession--and get away from Bob Burlingham.\"\n\n\"Can't I have a place without--what you said?\"\n\n\"Not as pretty a girl as you.  And if they ain't pretty the\npublic don't want 'em.\"\n\nSusan went to the door leading into the office.  \"No--the other\ndoor,\" said Blynn hastily.  He did not wish the office boy to\nread his defeat in Susan's countenance.  He got up himself,\nopened the door into the hall.  Susan passed out.  \"Think it\nover,\" said he, eyes and mouth full of longing.  \"Come round in\na day or two, and we'll have another talk.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Susan.  She felt no anger against him.  She felt\nabout him as she had about Jeb Ferguson.  It was not his fault;\nit was simply the way life was lived--part of the general misery\nand horror of the established order--like marriage and the rest\nof it.\n\n\"I'll treat you white,\" urged Blynn, tenderly.  \"I've got a soft\nheart--that's why I'll never get rich.  Any of the others'd ask\nmore and give less.\"\n\nShe looked at him with an expression that haunted him for\nseveral hours.  \"Thank you.  Good-by,\" she said, and went down the\nnarrow, rickety stairs--and out into the confused maze of\nstreets full of strangers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nAT the hotel again; she went to Burlingham's room, gathered his\nbelongings--his suit, his well-worn, twice-tapped shoes, his one\nextra suit of underclothes, a soiled shirt, two dickeys and\ncuffs, his whisk broom, toothbrush, a box of blacking, the\nblacking brush.  She made the package as compact as she could--it\nwas still a formidable bundle both for size and weight--and\ncarried it into her room.  Then she rolled into a small parcel\nher own possessions--two blouses, an undervest, a pair of\nstockings, a nightgown--reminder of Bethlehem and her brief sip\nat the cup of success--a few toilet articles.  With the two\nbundles she descended to the office.\n\n\"I came to say,\" she said calmly to the clerk, \"that we have no\nmoney to pay what we owe.  Mr. Burlingham is at the\nhospital--very sick with typhoid.  Here is a dollar and eighty\ncents.  You can have that, but I'd like to keep it, as it's all\nwe've got.\"\n\nThe clerk called the manager, and to him Susan repeated.  She\nused almost the same words; she spoke in the same calm,\nmonotonous way.  When she finished, the manager, a small, brisk\nman with a large brisk beard, said:\n\n\"No.  Keep the money.  I'd like to ask you to stay on.  But we run\nthis place for a class of people who haven't much at best and\nkeep wobbling back and forth across the line.  If I broke my\nrule----\"\n\nHe made a furious gesture, looked at the girl angrily--holding\nher responsible for his being in a position where he must do\nviolence to every decent instinct--\"My God, miss, I've got a\nwife and children to look after.  If I ran my hotel on sympathy,\nwhat'd become of them?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't take anything I couldn't pay for,\" said Susan.  \"As\nsoon as I earn some money----\"\n\n\"Don't worry about that,\" interrupted the manager.  He saw now\nthat he was dealing with one who would in no circumstances\nbecome troublesome; he went on in an easier tone:  \"You can stay\ntill the house fills up.\"\n\n\"Could you give me a place to wait on table and clean up\nrooms--or help cook?\"\n\n\"No, I don't need anybody.  The town's full of people out of\nwork.  You can't ask me to turn away----\"\n\n\"Please--I didn't know,\" cried the girl.\n\n\"Anyhow, I couldn't give but twelve a month and board,\"\ncontinued the manager.  \"And the work--for a lady like you----\"\n\nA lady!  She dropped her gaze in confusion.  If he knew about her birth!\n\n\"I'll do anything.  I'm not a lady,\" said she.  \"But I've got to\nhave at least ten a week in cash.\"\n\n\"No such place here.\" The manager was glad to find the fault of\nuppish ideas in this girl who was making it hard for him to be\nbusiness-like.  \"No such place anywhere for a beginner.\"\n\n\"I must have it,\" said the girl.\n\n\"I don't want to discourage you, but----\"  He was speaking less\ncurtly, for her expression made him suspect why she was bent\nupon that particular amount.  \"I hope you'll succeed.  Only--don't\nbe depressed if you're disappointed.\"\n\nShe smiled gravely at him; he bowed, avoiding her eyes.  She took\nup her bundles and went out into Walnut Street.  He moved a few\nsteps in obedience to an impulse to follow her, to give her\ncounsel and warning, to offer to help her about the larger\nbundle.  But he checked himself with the frown of his own not too\nprosperous affairs.\n\nIt was the hottest part of the day, and her way lay along\nunshaded streets.  As she had eaten nothing since the night\nbefore, she felt faint.  Her face was ghastly when she entered\nthe office of the hospital and left Burlingham's parcel.  The\nclerk at the desk told her that Burlingham was in the same\ncondition--\"and there'll be probably no change one way or the\nother for several days.\"\n\nShe returned to the street, wandered aimlessly about.  She knew\nshe ought to eat something, but the idea of food revolted her.\nShe was fighting the temptation to go to the _Commercial_ office,\nRoderick Spenser's office.  She had not a suspicion that his\nkindness might have been impulse, long since repented of,\nperhaps repented of as soon as he was away from her.  She felt\nthat if she went to him he would help her.  \"But I mustn't do\nit,\" she said to herself.  \"Not after what I did.\" No, she must\nnot see him until she could pay him back.  Also, and deeper,\nthere was a feeling that there was a curse upon her; had not\neveryone who befriended her come to grief?  She must not draw\nanyone else into trouble, must not tangle others in the meshes\nof her misfortunes.  She did not reason this out, of course; but\nthe feeling was not the less strong because the reasons for it\nwere vague in her mind.  And there was nothing vague about the\nresolve to which she finally came--that she would fight her\nbattle herself.\n\nHer unheeding wanderings led her after an hour or so to a big\ndepartment store.  Crowds of shoppers, mussy, hot, and cross,\nwere pushing rudely in and out of the doors.  She entered,\napproached a well-dressed, bareheaded old gentleman, whom she\nrightly placed as floorwalker, inquired of him:\n\n\"Where do they ask for work?\"\n\nShe had been attracted to him because his was the one face\nwithin view not suggesting temper or at least bad humor.  It was\nmore than pleasant, it was benign.  He inclined toward Susan with\nan air that invited confidence and application for balm for a\nwounded spirit.  The instant the nature of her inquiry penetrated\nthrough his pose to the man himself, there was a swift change to\nlofty disdain--the familiar attitude of workers toward\nfellow-workers of what they regard as a lower class.  Evidently\nhe resented her having beguiled him by the false air of young\nlady into wasting upon her, mere servility like himself, a\ndisplay reserved exclusively for patrons.  It was Susan's first\nexperience of this snobbishness; it at once humbled her into the\ndust.  She had been put in her place, and that place was not\namong people worthy of civil treatment.  A girl of his own class\nwould have flashed at him, probably would have \"jawed\" him.\nSusan meekly submitted; she was once more reminded that she was\nan outcast, one for whom the respectable world had no place.  He\nmade some sort of reply to her question, in the tone the usher\nof a fashionable church would use to a stranger obviously not in\nthe same set as the habitués.  She heard the tone, but not the\nwords; she turned away to seek the street again.  She wandered\non--through the labyrinth of streets, through the crowds on\ncrowds of strangers.\n\nTen dollars a week!  She knew little about wages, but enough to\nrealize the hopelessness of her quest.  Ten dollars a week--and\nher own keep beside.  The faces of the crowds pushing past her\nand jostling her made her heartsick.  So much sickness, and\nharassment, and discontent--so much unhappiness!  Surely all\nthese sad hearts ought to be kind to each other.  Yet they were\nnot; each soul went selfishly alone, thinking only of its own burden.\n\nShe walked on and on, thinking, in this disconnected way\ncharacteristic of a good intelligence that has not yet developed\norder and sequence, a theory of life and a purpose.  It had\nalways been her habit to walk about rather than to sit, whether\nindoors or out.  She could think better when in motion\nphysically.  When she was so tired that she began to feel weak,\nshe saw a shaded square, with benches under the trees.  She\nentered, sat down to rest.  She might apply to the young doctor.\nBut, no.  He was poor--and what chance was there of her ever\nmaking the money to pay back?  No, she could not take alms; than\nalms there was no lower way of getting money.  She might return\nto Mr. Blynn and accept his offer.  The man in all his physical\nhorror rose before her.  No, she could not do that.  At least, not\nyet.  She could entertain the idea as a possibility now.  She\nremembered her wedding--the afternoon, the night.  Yes, Blynn's\noffer involved nothing so horrible as that--and she had lived\nthrough that.  It would be cowardice, treachery, to shrink from\nanything that should prove necessary in doing the square thing\nby the man who had done so much for her.  She had said she would\ndie for Burlingham; she owed even that to him, if her death\nwould help him.  Had she then meant nothing but mere lying words\nof pretended gratitude?  But Blynn was always there; something\nelse might turn up, and her dollar and eighty cents would last\nanother day or so, and the ten dollars were not due for six\ndays.  No, she would not go to Blynn; she would wait, would take\nhis advice--\"think it over.\"\n\nA man was walking up and down the shaded alley, passing and\nrepassing the bench where she sat.  She observed him, saw that he\nwas watching her.  He was a young man--a very young man--of\nmiddle height, strongly built.  He had crisp, short dark hair, a\ndarkish skin, amiable blue-gray eyes, pleasing features.  She\ndecided that he was of good family, was home from some college\non vacation.  He was wearing a silk shirt, striped flannel\ntrousers, a thin serge coat of an attractive shade of blue.  She\nliked his looks, liked the way he dressed.  It pleased her that\nsuch a man should be interested in her; he had a frank and\nfriendly air, and her sad young heart was horribly lonely.  She\npretended not to notice him; but after a while he walked up to\nher, lifting his straw hat.\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" said he.  When he showed his strong sharp teeth\nin an amiable smile, she thought of Sam Wright--only this man\nwas not weak and mean looking, like her last and truest memory\npicture of Sam--indeed, the only one she had not lost.\n\"Good afternoon,\" replied she politely.  For in spite of\nBurlingham's explanations and cautionings she was still the\nsmall-town girl, unsuspicious toward courtesy from strange men.\nAlso, she longed for someone to talk with.  It had been weeks\nsince she had talked with anyone nearer than Burlingham to her\nown age and breeding.\n\n\"Won't you have lunch with me?\" he asked.  \"I hate to eat alone.\"\n\nShe, faint from hunger, simply could not help obvious hesitation\nbefore saying, \"I don't think I care for any.\"\n\n\"You haven't had yours--have you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"May I sit down?\"\n\nShe moved along the bench to indicate that he might, without\ndefinitely committing herself.\n\nHe sat, took off his hat.  He had a clean, fresh look about the\nneck that pleased her.  She was weary of seeing grimy, sweaty\npeople, and of smelling them.  Also, except the young doctor,\nsince Roderick Spenser left her at Carrolltown she had talked\nwith no one of her own age and class--the class in which she had\nbeen brought up, the class that, after making her one of itself,\nhad cast her out forever with its mark of shame upon her.  Its\nmark of shame--burning and stinging again as she sat beside this\nyoung man!\n\n\"You're sad about something?\" suggested he, himself nearly as\nembarrassed as she.\n\n\"My friend's ill.  He's got typhoid.\"\n\n\"That is bad.  But he'll get all right.  They always cure typhoid,\nnowadays--if it's taken in time and the nursing's good.\nEverything depends on the nursing.  I had it a couple of years\nago, and pulled through easily.\"\n\nSusan brightened.  He spoke so confidently that the appeal to her\nyoung credulity toward good news and the hopeful, cheerful thing\nwas irresistible.  \"Oh, yes--he'll be over it soon,\" the young\nman went on, \"especially if he's in a hospital where they've got\nthe facilities for taking care of sick people.  Where is he?\"\n\n\"In the hospital--up that way.\" She moved her head vaguely in\nthe direction of the northwest.\n\n\"Oh, yes.  It's a good one--for the pay patients.  I suppose for\nthe poor devils that can't pay\"--he glanced with careless\nsympathy at the dozen or so tramps on benches nearby--\"it's like\nall the rest of 'em--like the whole world, for that matter.  It\nmust be awful not to have money enough to get on with, I mean.\nI'm talking about men.\" He smiled cheerfully.  \"With a woman--if\nshe's pretty--it's different, of course.\"\n\nThe girl was so agitated that she did not notice the sly, if\nshy, hint in the remark and its accompanying glance.  Said she:\n\n\"But it's a good hospital if you pay?\"\n\n\"None better.  Maybe it's good straight through.  I've only heard\nthe servants' talk--and servants are such liars.  Still--I'd not\nwant to trust myself to a hospital unless I could pay.  I guess\nthe common people have good reason for their horror of free\nwards.  Nothing free is ever good.\"\n\nThe girl's face suddenly and startlingly grew almost hard, so\nfierce was the resolve that formed within her.  The money must be\ngot--_must!_--and would.  She would try every way she could think\nof between now and to-morrow; then--if she failed she would go\nto Blynn.\n\nThe young man was saying:  \"You're a stranger in town?\"\n\n\"I was with a theatrical company on a show boat.  It sank.\"\n\nHis embarrassment vanished.  She saw, but she did not understand\nthat it was because he thought he had \"placed\" her--and that her\nplace was where he had hoped.\n\n\"You _are_ up against it!\" said he.  \"Come have some lunch.  You'll\nfeel better.\"\n\nThe good sense of this was unanswerable.  Susan hesitated no\nlonger, wondered why she had hesitated at first.  \"Well--I guess\nI will.\" And she rose with a frank, childlike alacrity that\namused him immensely.\n\n\"You don't look it, but you've been about some--haven't you?\"\n\n\"Rather,\" replied she.\n\n\"I somehow thought you knew a thing or two.\"\n\nThey walked west to Race Street.  They were about the same\nheight.  Her costume might have been fresher, might have\nsuggested to an expert eye the passed-on clothes of a richer\nrelative; but her carriage and the fine look of skin and hair\nand features made the defects of dress unimportant.  She seemed\nof his class--of the class comfortable, well educated, and\nwell-bred.  If she had been more experienced, she would have seen\nthat he was satisfied with her appearance despite the curious\nlooking little package, and would have been flattered.  As it\nwas, her interest was absorbed in things apart from herself.  He\ntalked about the town--the amusements, the good times to be had\nat the over-the-Rhine beer halls, at the hilltop gardens, at the\ndances in the pavilion out at the Zoo.  He drew a lively and\ncharming picture, one that appealed to her healthy youth, to her\nunsatisfied curiosity, to her passionate desire to live the gay,\nfree city life of which the small town reads and dreams.\n\n\"You and I can go round together, can't we?  I haven't got much,\nbut I'll not try to take your time for nothing, of course.  That\nwouldn't be square.  I'm sure you'll have no cause to complain.\nWhat do you say?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" replied the girl, all at once absent-minded.  Her brain\nwas wildly busy with some ideas started there by his significant\nwords, by his flirtatious glances at her, by his way of touching\nher whenever he could make opportunity.  Evidently there was an\nalternative to Blynn.\n\n\"You like a good time, don't you?\" said he.\n\n\"Rather!\" exclaimed she, the violet eyes suddenly very violet\nindeed and sparkling.  Her spirits had suddenly soared.  She was\nacting like one of her age.  With that blessed happy hopefulness\nof healthy youth, she had put aside her sorrows--not because she\nwas frivolous but for the best of all reasons, because she was\nyoung and superbly vital.  Said she:  \"I'm crazy about\ndancing--and music.\"\n\n\"I only needed to look at your feet--and ankles--to know that,\"\nventured he the \"ankles\" being especially audacious.\n\nShe was pleased, and in youth's foolish way tried to hide her\npleasure by saying, \"My feet aren't exactly small.\"\n\n\"I should say not!\" protested he with energy.  \"Little feet would\nlook like the mischief on a girl as tall as you are.  Yes, we can\nhave a lot of fun.\"\n\nThey went into a large restaurant with fly fans speeding.  Susan\nthought it very grand--and it was the grandest restaurant she\nhad ever been in.  They sat down--in a delightfully cool place by\na window looking out on a little plot of green with a colladium,\na fountain, some oleanders in full and fragrant bloom; the young\nman ordered, with an ease that fascinated her, an elaborate\nlunch--soup, a chicken, with salad, ice cream, and fresh\npeaches.  Susan had a menu in her hand and as he ordered she\nnoted the prices.  She was dazzled by his extravagance--dazzled\nand frightened--and, in a curious, vague, unnerving way,\nfascinated.  Money--the thing she must have for Burlingham in\nwhose case \"everything depended on the nursing.\" In the brief\ntime this boy and she had been together, he, without making an\neffort to impress, had given her the feeling that he was of the\nbest city class, that he knew the world--the high world.  Thus,\nshe felt that she must be careful not to show her \"greenness.\"\nShe would have liked to protest against his extravagance, but she\nventured only the timid remonstrance, \"Oh, I'm not a bit hungry.\"\n\nShe thought she was speaking the truth, for the ideas whirling\nso fast that they were dim quite took away the sense of hunger.\nBut when the food came she discovered that she was, on the\ncontrary, ravenous--and she ate with rising spirits, with a\nfeeling of content and hope.  He had urged her to drink wine or\nbeer, but she refused to take anything but a glass of milk; and\nhe ended by taking milk himself.  He was looking more and more\nboldly and ardently into her eyes, and she received his glances\nsmilingly.  She felt thoroughly at ease and at home, as if she\nwere back once more among her own sort of people--with some\nelement of disagreeable constraint left out.\n\nSince she was an outcast, she need not bother about the small\nrestraints the girls felt compelled to put upon themselves in\nthe company of boys.  Nobody respected a \"bastard,\" as they\ncalled her when they spoke frankly.  So with nothing to lose she\ncould at least get what pleasure there was in freedom.  She liked\nit, having this handsome, well-dressed young man making love to\nher in this grand restaurant where things were so good to eat\nand so excitingly expensive.  He would not regard her as fit to\nassociate with his respectable mother and sisters.  In the casts\nof respectability, her place was with Jeb Ferguson!  She was\nbetter off, clear of the whole unjust and horrible business of\nrespectable life, clear of it and free, frankly in the outcast\nclass.  She had not realized--and she did not realize--that\nassociation with the players of the show boat had made any\nespecial change in her; in fact, it had loosened to the\nsloughing point the whole skin of her conventional\ntraining--that surface skin which seems part of the very essence\nof our being until something happens to force us to shed it.\nCrises, catastrophes, may scratch that skin, or cut clear\nthrough it; but only the gentle, steady, everywhere-acting\nprying-loose of day and night association can change it from a\nskin to a loose envelope ready to be shed at any moment.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked the young man, when the\nacquaintance had become a friendship--which was before the\npeaches and ice cream were served.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the girl, with the secretive instinct of\nself-reliance hiding the unhappiness his abrupt question set to\nthrobbing again.\n\n\"Honestly, I've never met anyone that was so congenial.  But\nmaybe you don't feel that way?\"\n\n\"Then again maybe I do,\" rejoined she, forcing a merry smile.\n\nHis face flushed with embarrassment, but his eyes grew more\nardent as he said:  \"What were you looking for, when I saw you\nin Garfield Place?\"\n\n\"Was that Garfield Place?\" she asked, in evasion.\n\n\"Yes.\" And he insisted, \"What were you looking for?\"\n\n\"What were _you_ looking for?\"\n\n\"For a pretty girl.\" They both laughed.  \"And I've found her.  I'm\nsuited if you are. . . .  Don't look so serious.  You haven't\nanswered my question.\"\n\n\"I'm looking for work.\"\n\nHe smiled as if it were a joke.  \"You mean for a place on the stage.\nThat isn't work.  _You_ couldn't work.  I can see that at a glance.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Oh, you haven't been brought up to that kind of life.  You'd\nhate it in every way.  And they don't pay women anything for\nwork.  My father employs a lot of them.  Most of his girls live at\nhome.  That keeps the wages down, and the others have to piece\nout with\"--he smiled--\"one thing and another.\"\n\nSusan sat gazing straight before her.  \"I've not had much\nexperience,\" she finally said, thoughtfully.  \"I guess I don't\nknow what I'm about.\"\n\nThe young man leaned toward her, his face flushing with\nearnestness.  \"You don't know how pretty you are.  I wish my\nfather wasn't so close with me.  I'd not let you ever speak of\nwork again--even on the stage.  What good times we could have!\"\n\n\"I must be going,\" said she, rising.  Her whole body was\nalternately hot and cold.  In her brain, less vague now, were the\nideas Mabel Connemora had opened up for her.\n\n\"Oh, bother!\" exclaimed he.  \"Sit down a minute.  You\nmisunderstood me.  I don't mean I'm flat broke.\"\n\nSusan hastily reseated herself, showing her confusion.  \"I wasn't\nthinking of that.\"\n\n\"Then--what were you thinking of?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she replied--truthfully, for she could not have\nput into words anything definite about the struggle raging in\nher like a battle in a fog.  \"I often don't exactly know what I'm\nthinking about.  I somehow can't--can't fit it together--yet.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose,\" he went on, as if she had not spoken, \"do you\nsuppose I don't understand?  I know you can't afford to let me\ntake your time for nothing. . . .  Don't you like me a little?\"\n\nShe looked at him with grave friendliness.  \"Yes.\" Then, seized\nwith a terror which her habitual manner of calm concealed from\nhim, she rose again.\n\n\"Why shouldn't it be me as well as another?. . .  At least sit\ndown till I pay the bill.\"\n\nShe seated herself, stared at her plate.\n\n\"Now what are you thinking about?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know exactly.  Nothing much.\"\n\nThe waiter brought the bill.  The young man merely glanced at the\ntotal, drew a small roll of money from his trousers pocket, put\na five-dollar note on the tray with the bill.  Susan's eyes\nopened wide when the waiter returned with only two quarters and\na dime.  She glanced furtively at the young man, to see if he, too,\nwas not disconcerted.  He waved the tray carelessly aside; the\nwaiter said \"Thank you,\" in a matter-of-course way, dropped the\nsixty cents into his pocket.  The waiter's tip was by itself almost\nas much as she had ever seen paid out for a meal for two persons.\n\n\"Now, where shall we go?\" asked the young man.\n\nSusan did not lift her eyes.  He leaned toward her, took her\nhand.  \"You're different from the sort a fellow usually finds,\"\nsaid he.  \"And I'm--I'm crazy about you.  Let's go,\" said he.\n\nSusan took her bundle, followed him.  She glanced up the street\nand down.  She had an impulse to say she must go away alone; it\nwas not strong enough to frame a sentence, much less express her\nthought.  She was seeing queer, vivid, apparently disconnected\nvisions--Burlingham, sick unto death, on the stretcher in the\nhospital reception room--Blynn of the hideous face and loose,\nrepulsive body--the contemptuous old gentleman in the shop--odds\nand ends of the things Mabel Connemora had told her--the roll of\nbills the young man had taken from his pocket when he paid--Jeb\nFerguson in the climax of the horrors of that wedding day and\nnight.  They went to Garfield Place, turned west, paused after a\nblock or so at a little frame house set somewhat back from the\nstreet.  The young man, who had been as silent as she--but\nnervous instead of preoccupied--opened the gate in the picket fence.\n\n\"This is a first-class quiet place,\" said he, embarrassed but\ntrying to appear at ease.\n\nSusan hesitated.  She must somehow nerve herself to speak of\nmoney, to say to him that she needed ten dollars--that she must\nhave it.  If she did not speak--if she got nothing for Mr.\nBurlingham--or almost nothing--and probably men didn't give\nwomen much--if she were going with him--to endure again the\nhorrors and the degradation she had suffered from Mr.\nFerguson--if it should be in vain!  This nice young man didn't\nsuggest Mr. Ferguson in any way.  But there was such a mystery\nabout men--they had a way of changing so--Sam Wright--Uncle\nGeorge even Mr. Ferguson hadn't seemed capable of torturing a\nhelpless girl for no reason at all----\n\n\"We can't stand here,\" the young man was saying.\n\nShe tried to speak about the ten dollars.  She simply could not\nforce out the words.  With brain in a whirl, with blood beating\nsuffocatingly into her throat and lungs, but giving no outward\nsign of agitation, she entered the gate.  There was a low,\nold-fashioned porch along the side of the house, with an awning\ncuriously placed at the end toward the street.  When they\nascended the steps under the awning, they were screened from the\nstreet.  The young man pulled a knob.  A bell within tinkled\nfaintly; Susan started, shivered.  But the young man, looking\nstraight at the door, did not see.  A colored girl with a\npleasant, welcoming face opened, stood aside for them to enter.\nHe went straight up the stairs directly ahead, and Susan\nfollowed.  At the threshold the trembling girl looked round in\nterror.  She expected to see a place like that foul, close little\nfarm bedroom--for it seemed to her that at such times men must\nseek some dreadful place--vile, dim, fitting.  She was in a\nsmall, attractively furnished room, with a bow window looking\nupon the yard and the street.  The furniture reminded her of her\nown room at her uncle's in Sutherland, except that the brass bed\nwas far finer.  He closed the door and locked it.\n\nAs he advanced toward her he said:  \"_What_ are you seeing?  Please\ndon't look like that.\" Persuasively, \"You weren't thinking of\nme--were you?\"\n\n\"No--Oh, no,\" replied she, passing her hand over her eyes to try\nto drive away the vision of Ferguson.\n\n\"You look as if you expected to be murdered.  Do you want to go?\"\n\nShe forced herself to seem calm.  \"What a coward I am!\" she said\nto herself.  \"If I could only die for him, instead of this.  But\nI can't.  And I _must_ get money for him.\"\n\nTo the young man she said:  \"No.  I--I--want to stay.\"\n\n\nLate in the afternoon, when they were once more in the street,\nhe said.  \"I'd ask you to go to dinner with me, but I haven't\nenough money.\"\n\nShe stopped short.  An awful look came into her face.\n\n\"Don't be alarmed,\" cried he, hurried and nervous, and blushing\nfuriously.  \"I put the--the present for you in that funny little\nbundle of yours, under one of the folds of the nightgown or\nwhatever it is you've got wrapped on the outside.  I didn't like\nto hand it to you.  I've a feeling somehow that you're not\nregularly--that kind.\"\n\n\"Was it--ten dollars?\" she said, and for all he could see she\nwas absolutely calm.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied he, with a look of relief followed by a smile of\namused tenderness.\n\n\"I can't make you out,\" he went on.  \"You're a queer one.  You've\nhad a look in your eyes all afternoon--well, if I hadn't been\nsure you were experienced, you'd almost have frightened me away.\"\n\n\"Yes, I've had experience.  The--the worst,\" said the girl.\n\n\"You--you attract me awfully; you've got--well, everything\nthat's nice about a woman--and at the same time, there's\nsomething in your eyes---- Are you very fond of your friend?\"\n\n\"He's all I've got in the world.\"\n\n\"I suppose it's his being sick that makes you look and act so queer?\"\n\n\"I don't know what's the matter with me,\" she said slowly.\n\"I--don't know.\"\n\n\"I want to see you again--soon.  What's your address?\"\n\n\"I haven't any.  I've got to look for a place to live.\"\n\n\"Well, you can give me the place you did live.  I'll write you\nthere, Lorna.  You didn't ask me my name when I asked you yours.\nYou've hardly said anything.  Are you always quiet like this?\"\n\n\"No--not always.  At Least, I haven't been.\"\n\n\"No.  You weren't, part of the time this afternoon--at the\nrestaurant.  Tell me, what are you thinking about all the time?\nYou're very secretive.  Why don't you tell me?  Don't you know I\nlike you?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the girl in a slow dazed way.  \"I--don't--know.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't take your time for nothing,\" he went on, after a\npause.  \"My father doesn't give me much money, but I think I'll\nhave some more day after tomorrow.  Can I see you then?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nHe laughed.  \"You said that before.  Day after tomorrow\nafternoon--in the same place.  No matter if it's raining.  I'll be\nthere first--at three.  Will you come?\"\n\n\"If I can.\"\n\nShe made a movement to go.  But still he detained her.  He colored\nhigh again, in the struggle between the impulses of his generous\nyouth and the fear of being absurd with a girl he had picked up\nin the street.  He looked at her searchingly, wistfully.  \"I know\nit's your life, but--I hate to think of it,\" he went on.  \"You're\nfar too nice.  I don't see how you happened to be in--in this\nline.  Still, what else is there for a girl, when she's up\nagainst it?  I've often thought of those things--and I don't feel\nabout them as most people do. . . .  I'm curious about you.\nYou'll pardon me, won't you?  I'm afraid I'll fall in love with\nyou, if I see you often.  You won't fail to come day after tomorrow?\"\n\n\"If I can.\"\n\n\"Don't you want to see me again?\"\n\nShe did not speak or lift her eyes.\n\n\"You like me, don't you?\"\n\nStill no answer.\n\n\"You don't want to be questioned?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Where are you going now?\"\n\n\"To the hospital.\"\n\n\"May I walk up there with you?  I live in Clifton.  I can go home\nthat way.\"\n\n\"I'd rather you didn't.\"\n\n\"Then--good-by--till day after tomorrow at three.\" He put out\nhis hand; he had to reach for hers and take it.  \"You're not--not\nangry with me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nHis eyes lingered tenderly upon her.  \"You are _so_ sweet!  You\ndon't know how I want to kiss you.  Are you sorry to go--sorry to\nleave me--just a little?. . .  I forgot.  You don't like to be\nquestioned.  Well, good-by, dear.\"\n\n\"Good-by,\" she said; and still without lifting her gaze from the\nground she turned away, walked slowly westward.\n\nShe had not reached the next street to the north when she\nsuddenly felt that if she did not sit she would drop.  She lifted\nher eyes for an instant to glance furtively round.  She saw a\nhouse with stone steps leading up to the front doors; there was\na \"for rent\" sign in one of the close-shuttered parlor windows.\nShe seated herself, supported the upper part of her weary body\nby resting her elbows on her knees.  Her bundle had rolled to the\nsidewalk at her feet.  A passing man picked it up, handed it to\nher, with a polite bow.  She looked at him vaguely, took the\nbundle as if she were not sure it was hers.\n\n\"Heat been too much for you, miss?\" asked the man.\n\nShe shook her head.  He lingered, talking volubly--about the\nweather--then about how cool it was on the hilltops.  \"We might\ngo up to the Bellevue,\" he finally suggested, \"if you've nothing\nbetter to do.\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" she said.\n\n\"I'll go anywhere you like.  I've got a little money that I don't\ncare to keep.\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"I don't mean anything bad,\" he hastened to suggest--because\nthat would bring up the subject in discussable form.\n\n\"I can't go with you,\" said the girl drearily.  \"Don't bother me, please.\"\n\n\"Oh--excuse me.\" And the man went on.\n\nSusan turned the bundle over in her lap, thrust her fingers\nslowly and deliberately into the fold of the soiled blouse which\nwas on the outside.  She drew out the money.  A ten and two fives.\nEnough to keep his room at the hospital for two weeks.  No, for\nshe must live, herself.  Enough to give him a room one week\nlonger and to enable her to live two weeks at least. . . .  And\nday after tomorrow--more.  Perhaps, soon--enough to see him\nthrough the typhoid.  She put the money in her bosom, rose and\nwent on toward the hospital.  She no longer felt weary, and the\nsensation of a wound that might ache if she were not so numb\npassed away.\n\nA clerk she had not seen before was at the barrier desk.  \"I came\nto ask how Mr. Burlingham is,\" said she.\n\nThe clerk yawned, drew a large book toward him.\n\"Burlingham--B--Bu--Bur----\" he said half to himself, turning\nover the leaves.  \"Yes--here he is.\" He looked at her.  \"You his\ndaughter?\"\n\n\"No, I'm a friend.\"\n\n\"Oh--then--he died at five o'clock--an hour ago.\"\n\nHe looked up--saw her eyes--only her eyes.  They were a deep\nviolet now, large, shining with tragic softness--like the eyes\nof an angel that has lost its birthright through no fault of its\nown.  He turned hastily away, awed, terrified, ashamed of himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nTHE next thing she knew, she felt herself seized strongly by the\narm.  She gazed round in a dazed way.  She was in the street--how\nshe got there she had no idea.  The grip on her arm--it was the\nyoung doctor, Hamilton.  \"I called you twice,\" explained he, \"but\nyou didn't hear.\"\n\n\"He is dead,\" said she.\n\nHamilton had a clear view of her face now.  There was not a trace\nof the child left.  He saw her eyes--quiet, lonely, violet stars.\n\"You must go and rest quietly,\" he said with gentleness.  \"You\nare worn out.\"\n\nSusan took from her bosom the twenty dollars, handed it to him.\n\"It belongs to him,\" said she.  \"Give it to them, to bury him.\"\nAnd she started on.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" asked the young man.\n\nSusan stopped, looked vaguely at him.  \"Good-by,\" she said.\n\"You've been very kind.\"\n\n\"You've found a boarding place?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm all right.\"\n\n\"You want to see him?\"\n\n\"No.  Then he'll always be alive to me.\"\n\n\"You had better keep this money.  The city will take care of\nthe funeral.\"\n\n\"It belong to him.  I couldn't keep it for myself.  I must be\ngoing.\"\n\n\"Shan't I see you again?\"\n\n\"I'll not trouble you.\"\n\n\"Let me walk with you as far as your place.\"\n\n\"I'm not feeling--just right.  If you don't mind--please--I'd\nrather be alone.\"\n\n\"I don't mean to intrude, but----\"\n\n\"I'm all right,\" said the girl.  \"Don't worry about me.\"\n\n\"But you are too young----\"\n\n\"I've been married. . . .  Thank you, but--good-by.\"\n\nHe could think of no further excuse for detaining her.  Her\nmanner disquieted him, yet it seemed composed and natural.\nProbably she had run away from a good home, was now sobered and\nchastened, was eager to separate herself from the mess she had\ngot into and return to her own sort of people.  It struck him as\nheartless that she should go away in this fashion; but on second\nthought, he could not associate heartlessness with her.  Also, he\nsaw how there might be something in what she had said about not\nwishing to have to think of her friend as dead.  He stood\nwatching her straight narrow young figure until it was lost to\nview in the crowd of people going home from work.\n\nSusan went down Elm Street to Garfield Place, seated herself on\none of the benches.  She was within sight of the unobtrusive\nlittle house with the awnings; but she did not realize it.  She\nhad no sense of her surroundings, of the passing of time, felt\nno grief, no sensation of any kind.  She simply sat, her little\nbundle in her lap, her hands folded upon it.\n\nA man in uniform paused before her.  \"Closing-up time,\" he said,\nsharply but in the impartial official way.  \"I'm going to lock\nthe gates.\"\n\nShe looked at him.\n\nIn a softer, apologetic tone, he said, \"I've got to lock the\ngates.  That's the law, miss.\"\n\nShe did not clearly understand, but rose and went out into Race\nStreet.  She walked slowly along, not knowing or caring where.\nShe walked--walked--walked.  Sometimes her way lay through crowded\nstreets, again through streets deserted.  Now she was stumbling\nover the uneven sidewalks of a poor quarter; again it was the\nsmooth flagstones of the shopping or wholesale districts.\nSeveral times she saw the river with its multitude of boats\ngreat and small; several times she crossed the canal.  Twice she\nturned back because the street was mounting the hills behind the\ncity--the hills with the cars swiftly ascending and descending\nthe inclined planes, and at the crests gayly lighted pavilions\nwhere crowds were drinking and dancing.  Occasionally some man\nspoke to her, but desisted as she walked straight on, apparently\nnot hearing.  She rested from time to time, on a stoop or on a\nbarrel or box left out by some shopkeeper, or leaning upon the\nrail of a canal bridge.  She was walking with a purpose--to try\nto scatter the dense fog that had rolled in and enveloped her\nmind, and then to try to think.\n\nShe sat, or rather dropped, down from sheer fatigue, in that\ncool hour which precedes the dawn.  It happened to be the steps\nof a church.  She fell into a doze, was startled back to\nconsciousness by the deep boom of the bell in the steeple; it\nmade the stone vibrate under her.  One--two--three--four!  Toward\nthe east there shone a flush of light, not yet strong enough to\ndim the stars.  The sky above her was clear.  The pall of smoke\nrolled away.  The air felt clean and fresh, even had in it a\nreminiscence of the green fields whence it had come.  She began\nto revive, like a sleeper shaking off drowsiness and the spell\nof a bad dream and looking forward to the new day.  The fog that\nhad swathed and stupefied her brain seemed to have lifted.  At\nher heart there was numbness and a dull throbbing, an ache; but\nher mind was clear and her body felt intensely, hopelessly\nalive and ready, clamorously ready, for food.  A movement across\nthe narrow street attracted her attention.  A cellar door was\nrising--thrust upward by the shoulders of a man.  It fell full\nopen with a resounding crash, the man revealed by the light from\nbeneath--a white blouse, a white cap.  Toward her wafted the\ndelicious odor of baking bread.  She rose, hesitated only an\ninstant, crossed the street directly toward the baker who had\ncome up to the surface for cool air.\n\n\"I am hungry,\" said she to him.  \"Can't you let me have something\nto eat?\"\n\nThe man--he had a large, smooth, florid face eyed her in amused\nastonishment.  \"Where'd you jump from?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I was resting on the church steps over there.  The smell came to\nme and--I couldn't stand it.  I can pay.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" said the man, with a strong German\naccent.  \"Come down.\" And he descended the steps, she following.\nIt was a large and lofty cellar, paved with cement; floor,\nceilings, walls, were whitened with flour.  There were long clean\ntables for rolling the dough; big wooden bowls; farther back,\nthe ovens and several bakers at work adding to the huge piles of\nloaves the huge baskets of rolls.  Susan's eyes glistened; her\nwhite teeth showed in a delightful smile of hunger about to be\nsatisfied.\n\n\"Do you want bread or rolls?\" asked the German.  Then without\nwaiting for her to answer, \"I guess some of the 'sweet rolls,'\nwe call 'em, would about suit a lady.\"\n\n\"Yes--the sweet rolls,\" said the girl.\n\nThe baker fumbled about behind a lot of empty baskets, found a\nsewing basket, filled it with small rolls--some crescent in\nshape, some like lady fingers, some oval, some almost like\nbiscuit, all with pulverized sugar powdered on them thick as a\nfrosting.  He set the little basket upon an empty kneading table.\n\"Wait yet a minute,\" he commanded, and bustled up a flight of\nstairs.  He reappeared with a bottle of milk and a piece of fresh\nbutter.  He put these beside the basket of rolls, drew a stool up\nbefore them.  \"How's that?\" asked he, his hands on his hips, his\nhead on one side, and his big jolly face beaming upon her.\n\"Pretty good, don't it!\"\n\nSusan was laughing with pleasure.  He pointed to the place well\ndown in the bottle of milk where the cream ended.  \"That's the\nway it should be always--not so!\" said he.  She nodded.  Then he\nshook the bottle to remix the separated cream and milk.  \"So!\" he\ncried.  Then--\"_Ach, dummer Esel!_\" he muttered, striking his\nbrow a resounding thwack with the flat of his hand.  \"A knife!\"\nAnd he hastened to repair that omission.\n\nSusan sat at the table, took one of the fresh rolls, spread\nbutter upon it.  The day will never come for her when she cannot\ndistinctly remember the first bite of the little sweet buttered\nroll, eaten in that air perfumed with the aroma of baking bread.\nThe milk was as fine as it promised to be she drank it from the bottle.\n\nThe German watched her a while, then beckoned to his fellow\nworkmen.  They stood round, reveling in the joyful sight of this\npretty hungry girl eating so happily and so heartily.\n\n\"The pie,\" whispered one workman to another.\n\nThey brought a small freshly baked peach pie, light and crisp\nand brown.  Susan's beautiful eyes danced.  \"But,\" she said to her\nfirst friend among the bakers, \"I'm afraid I can't afford it.\"\n\nAt this there was a loud chorus of laughter.  \"Eat it,\" said her friend.\n\nAnd when she had finished her rolls and butter, she did eat it.\n\"I never tasted a pie like that,\" declared she.  \"And I like pies\nand can make them too.\"\n\nOnce more they laughed, as if she had said the wittiest thing in\nthe world.\n\nAs the last mouthful of the pie was disappearing, her friend\nsaid, \"Another!\"\n\n\"Goodness, no!\" cried the girl.  \"I couldn't eat a bite more.\"\n\n\"But it's an apple pie.\"  And he brought it, holding it on his big\nflorid fat hand and turning it round to show her its full beauty.\n\nShe sighed regretfully.  \"I simply can't,\" she said.  \"How much is\nwhat I've had?\"\n\nHer friend frowned.  \"Vot you take me for--hey?\" demanded he,\nwith a terrible frown--so terrible he felt it to be that,\nfearing he had frightened her, he burst out laughing, to reassure.\n\n\"Oh, but I must pay,\" she pleaded.  \"I didn't come begging.\"\n\n\"Not a cent!\" said her friend firmly.  \"I'm the boss.  I won't take it.\"\n\nShe insisted until she saw she was hurting his feelings.  Then\nshe tried to thank him; but he would not listen to that, either.\n\"Good-by--good-by,\" he said gruffly.  \"I must get to work once.\"\nBut she understood, and went with a light heart up into the\nworld again.  He stood waist deep in the cellar, she hesitated\nupon the sidewalk.  \"Good-by,\" she said, with swimming eyes.\n\"You don't know how good you've been to me.\"\n\n\"All right.  Luck!\" He waved his hand, half turned his back on\nher and looked intently up the street, his eyes blinking.\n\nShe went down the street, turned the first corner, dropped on a\ndoorstep and sobbed and cried, out of the fullness of her heart.\nWhen she rose to go on again, she felt stronger and gentler than\nshe had felt since her troubles began with the quarrel over Sam\nWright.  A little further on she came upon a florist's shop in\nfront of which a wagon was unloading the supply of flowers for\nthe day's trade.  She paused to look at the roses and carnations,\nthe lilies and dahlias, the violets and verbenas and geraniums.\nThe fast brightening air was scented with delicate odors.  She\nwas attracted to a small geranium with many buds and two\nfull-blown crimson flowers.\n\n\"How much for that?\" she asked a young man who seemed to be in charge.\n\nHe eyed her shrewdly.  \"Well, I reckon about fifteen cents,\"\nreplied he.\n\nShe took from her bosom the dollar bill wrapped round the eighty\ncents, gave him what he had asked.  \"No, you needn't tie it up,\"\nsaid she, as he moved to take it into the store.  She went back\nto the bakeshop.  The cellar door was open, but no one was in\nsight.  Stooping down, she called:  \"Mr. Baker!  Mr. Baker!\"\n\nThe big smooth face appeared below.\n\nShe set the plant down on the top step.  \"For you,\" she said, and\nhurried away.\n\nOn a passing street car she saw the sign \"Eden Park.\" She had\nheard of it--of its beauties, of the wonderful museum there.  She\ntook the next car of the same line.  A few minutes, and it was\nbeing drawn up the inclined plane toward the lofty hilltops.  She\nhad thought the air pure below.  She was suddenly lifted through\na dense vapor--the cloud that always lies over the lower part of\nthe city.  A moment, and she was above the cloud, was being\ncarried through the wide, clean tree-lined avenue of a beautiful\nsuburb.  On either side, lawns and gardens and charming houses,\na hush brooding over them.  Behind these walls, in comfortable\nbeds, amid the surroundings that come to mind with the word\n\"home,\" lay many girls such as she--happy, secure, sheltered.\nGirls like herself.  A wave of homesickness swept over her,\ndaunting her for a little while.  But she fought it down, watched\nwhat was going on around her.  \"I mustn't look back--I mustn't!\nNothing there for me.\" At the main gateway of the park she\ndescended.  There indeed was the, to her, vast building\ncontaining the treasures of art; but she had not come for that.\nShe struck into the first by-path, sought out a grassy slope\nthickly studded with bushes, and laid herself down.  She spread\nher skirts carefully so as not to muss them.  She put her bundle\nunder her head.\n\nWhen she awoke the moon was shining upon her face--shining from\na starry sky!\n\nShe sat up, looked round in wonder.  Yes--it was night\nagain--very still, very beautiful, and warm, with the air\nfragrant and soft.  She felt intensely awake, entirely\nrested--and full of hope.  It was as if during that long\ndreamless sleep her whole being had been renewed and magically\nborne away from the lands of shadow and pain where it had been\nwandering, to a land of bright promise.  Oh, youth, youth, that\nbears so lightly the burden of the past, that faces so\nconfidently the mystery of the future!  She listened--heard a\nfaint sound that moved her to investigate.  Peering through the\ndense bushes, she discovered on the grass in the shadow of the\nnext clump, a ragged, dirty man and woman, both sound asleep and\nsnoring gently.  She watched them spellbound.  The man's face was\ndeeply shaded by his battered straw hat.  But she could see the\nwoman's face plainly--the thin, white hair, the sunken eyes and\nmouth, the skeleton look of old features over which the dry skin\nof age is tightly drawn.  She gazed until the man, moving in his\nsleep, kicked out furiously and uttered a curse.  She drew back,\ncrawled away until she had put several clumps of bushes between\nher and the pair.  Then she sped down and up the slopes and did\nnot stop until she was where she could see, far below, the\nfriendly lights of the city blinking at her through the smoky mist.\n\nShe had forgotten her bundle!  She did not know how to find the\nplace where she had left it; and, had she known, she would not\nhave dared return.  This loss, however, troubled her little.  Not\nin vain had she dwelt with the philosopher Burlingham.\n\nShe seated herself on a bench and made herself comfortable.  But\nshe no longer needed sleep.  She was awake--wide awake--in every\natom of her vigorous young body.  The minutes dragged.  She was\nimpatient for the dawn to give the signal for the future to roll\nup its curtain.  She would have gone down into the city to walk\nabout but she was now afraid the police would take her in--and\nthat probably would mean going to a reformatory, for she could\nnot give a satisfactory account of herself.  True, her older way\nof wearing her hair and some slight but telling changes in her\ndress had made her look less the child.  But she could not hope\nto pass for a woman full grown.  The moon set; the starlight was\nafter a long, long time succeeded by the dawn of waking birds,\nand of waking city, too--for up from below rose an ever louder\nroar like a rising storm.  In her restless rovings, she came upon\na fountain; she joined the birds making a toilet in its basin,\nand patterned after them--washed her face and hands, dried them\non a handkerchief she by great good luck had put into her\nstocking, smoothed her hair, her dress.\n\nAnd still the sense of unreality persisted, cast its friendly\nspell over this child-woman suddenly caught up from the quietest\nof quiet lives and whirled into a dizzy vortex of strange events\nwithout parallel, or similitude even, in anything she had ever\nknown.  If anyone had suddenly asked her who she was and she had\ntried to recall, she would have felt as if trying to remember a\ndream.  Sutherland--a faint, faint dream, and the show boat also.\nSpenser--a romantic dream--or a first installment of a love-story\nread in some stray magazine.  Burlingham--the theatrical\nagent--the young man of the previous afternoon--the news of the\ndeath that left her quite alone--all a dream, a tumbled, jumbled\ndream, all passed with the night and the awakening.  In her youth\nand perfect health, refreshed by the long sleep, gladdened by\nthe bright new day, she was as irresponsible as the merry birds\nchattering and flinging the water about at the opposite side of\nthe fountain's basin.  She was now glad she had lost her bundle.\nWithout it her hands were free both hands free to take whatever\nmight offer next.  And she was eager to see what that would be,\nand hopeful about it--no--more than hopeful, confident.\nBurlingham, aided by those highly favorable surroundings of the\nshow boat, and of the vagabond life thereafter, had developed in\nher that gambler's spirit which had enabled him to play year\nafter year of losing hands with unabating courage--the spirit\nthat animates all the brave souls whose deeds awe the docile,\nconventional, craven masses of mankind.\n\nLeisurely as a truant she tramped back toward the city, pausing\nto observe anything that chanced to catch her eye.  At the moment\nof her discovery of the difference between her and most girls\nthere had begun a cleavage between her and the social system.\nAnd now she felt as if she were of one race and the rest of the\nworld of another and hostile race.  She did not realize it, but\nshe had taken the first great step along the path that leads to\ndistinction or destruction.  For the world either obeys or\ntramples into dust those who, in whatever way, have a lot apart\nfrom the common.  She was free from the bonds of convention--free\nto soar or to sink.\n\nHer way toward the city lay along a slowly descending street\nthat had been, not so very long before, a country road.  Block\nafter block there were grassy fields intersected by streets, as\nif city had attempted a conquest of country and had abandoned\nit.  Again the vacant lots were disfigured with the ruins of a\nshanty or by dreary dump heaps.  For long stretches the way was\nbuilt up only on one side.  The houses were for the most part\ntenement with small and unprosperous shops or saloons on the\nground floor.  Toward the foot of the hill, where the line of\ntenements was continuous on either side, she saw a sign\n\"Restaurant\" projecting over the sidewalk.  When she reached it,\nshe paused and looked in.  A narrow window and a narrow open door\ngave a full view of the tiny room with its two rows of plain\ntables.  Near the window was a small counter with a case\ncontaining cakes and pies and rolls.  With back to the window sat\na pretty towheaded girl of about her own age, reading.  Susan,\nclose to the window, saw that the book was Owen Meredith's\n\"Lucile,\" one of her own favorites.  She could even read the words:\n\n\nThe ways they are many and wide, and seldom are two ways the same.\n\n\nShe entered.  The girl glanced up, with eyes slowly changing from\nfar-away dreaminess to present and practical--pleasant blue eyes\nwith lashes and brows of the same color as the thick, neatly\ndone yellowish hair.\n\n\"Could I get a glass of milk and a roll?\" asked Susan, a modest\ndemand, indeed, on behalf of a growing girl's appetite\ntwenty-four hours unsatisfied.\n\nThe blonde girl smiled, showing a clean mouth with excellent teeth.\n\"We sell the milk for five cents, the rolls three for a nickel.\"\n\n\"Then I'll take milk and three rolls,\" said Susan.  \"May I sit at\na table?  I'll not spoil it.\"\n\n\"Sure.  Sit down.  That's what the tables are for.\" And the girl\nclosed the book, putting a chromo card in it to mark her place,\nand stirred about to serve the customer.  Susan took the table\nnearest the door, took the seat facing the light.  The girl set\nbefore her a plate, a knife and fork, a little form of butter, a\ntall glass of milk, and three small rolls in a large saucer.\n\"You're up and out early?\" she said to Susan.\n\nOn one of those inexplicable impulses of frankness Susan\nreplied:  \"I've been sleeping in the park.\"\n\nThe girl had made the remark merely to be polite and was turning\naway.  As Susan's reply penetrated to her inattentive mind she\nlooked sharply at her, eyes opening wonderingly.  \"Did you get\nlost?  Are you a stranger in town?  Why didn't you ask someone to\ntake you in?\"\n\nThe girl reflected, realized.  \"That's so,\" said she.  \"I never\nthought of it before. . . .  Yes, that is so!  It must be dreadful\nnot to have any place to go.\" She gazed at Susan with admiring\neyes.  \"Weren't you afraid--up in the park?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Susan.  \"I hadn't anything anybody'd want to steal.\"\n\n\"But some man might have----\"  The girl left it to Susan's\nimagination to finish the sentence.\n\n\"I hadn't anything to steal,\" repeated Susan, with a kind of\ncynical melancholy remotely suggestive of Mabel Connemora.\n\nThe restaurant girl retired behind the counter to reflect, while\nSusan began upon her meager breakfast with the deliberation of\none who must coax a little to go a great ways.  Presently the\ngirl said:\n\n\"Where are you going to sleep tonight?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's a long ways off,\" replied the apt pupil of the\nhappy-go-lucky houseboat show.  \"I'll find a place, I guess.\"\n\nThe girl looked thoughtfully toward the street.  \"I was\nwondering,\" she said after a while, \"what I'd do if I was to find\nmyself out in the street, with no money and nowhere to go. . . .\nAre you looking for something to do?\"\n\n\"Do you know of anything?\" asked Susan interested at once.\n\n\"Nothing worth while.  There's a box factory down on the next\nsquare.  But only a girl that lives at home can work there.  Pa\nsays the day's coming when women'll be like men--work at\neverything and get the same wages.  But it isn't so now.  A girl's\ngot to get married.\"\n\nSuch a strange expression came over Susan's face that the\nwaitress looked apologetic and hastened to explain herself:  \"I\ndon't much mind the idea of getting married,\" said she.\n\"Only--I'm afraid I can never get the kind of a man I'd want.\nThe boys round here leave school before the girls, so the girls\nare better educated.  And then they feel above the boys of their\nown class--except those boys that're beginning to get up in the\nworld--and those kind of boys want some girl who's above them\nand can help them up.  It's dreadful to be above the people you\nknow and not good enough for the people you'd like to know.\"\n\nSusan was not impressed; she could not understand why the\nwaitress spoke with so much feeling.  \"Well,\" said she, pausing\nbefore beginning on the last roll, \"I don't care so long as I\nfind something to do.\"\n\n\"There's another thing,\" complained the waitress.  \"If you work\nin a store, you can't get wages enough to live on; and you learn\nthings, and want to live better and better all the time.  It\nmakes you miserable.  And you can't marry the men who work at\nnice refined labor because they don't make enough to marry on.\nAnd if you work in a factory or as a servant, why all but the\ncommonest kind of men look down on you.  You may get wages enough\nto live on, but you can't marry or get up in the world.\"\n\n\"You're very ambitious, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Indeed I am.  I don't want to be in the working class.\" She was\nleaning over the counter now, and her blond face was expressing\ndeep discontent and scorn.  \"I _hate_ working people.  All of them\nwho have any sense look down on themselves and wish they could\nget something respectable to do.\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't mean that,\" protested Susan.  \"Any kind of work's\nrespectable if it's honest.\"\n\n\"_You_ can say that,\" retorted the girl.  \"_You_ don't belong in\nour class.  You were brought up different.  You are a _lady_.\"\n\nSusan shrank and grew crimson.  The other girl did not see.  She\nwent on crossly:\n\n\"Upper-class people always talk about how fine it is to be an\nhonest workingman.  But that's all rot.  Let 'em try it a while.\nAnd pa says it'll never be straightened out till everybody has\nto work.\"\n\n\"What--what does your father do?\"\n\n\"He was a cabinetmaker.  Then one of the other men tipped over a\nbig chest and his right hand was crushed--smashed to pieces, so\nhe wasn't able to work any more.  But he's mighty smart in his\nbrains.  It's the kind you can't make any money out of.  He has\nread most everything.  The trouble with pa was he had too much\nheart.  He wasn't mean enough to try and get ahead of the other\nworkmen, and rise to be a boss over them, and grind them down to\nmake money for the proprietor.  So he stayed on at the bench--he\nwas a first-class cabinetmaker.  The better a man is as a\nworkman, and the nicer he is as a man, the harder it is for him\nto get up.  Pa was too good at his trade--and too soft-hearted.\nWon't you have another glass of milk?\"\n\n\"No--thank you,\" said Susan.  She was still hungry, but it\nalarmed her to think of taking more than ten cents from her hoard.\n\n\"Are you going to ask for work at the box factory?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid they wouldn't take me.  I don't know how to make boxes.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's nothing,\" assured the restaurant girl.  \"It's the\neasiest kind of work.  But then an educated person can pick\nup most any trade in a few days, well enough to get along.\nThey'll make you a paster, at first.\"\n\n\"How much does that pay?\"\n\n\"He'll offer you two fifty a week, but you must make him give\nyou three.  That's right for beginners.  Then, if you stay on and\nwork hard, you'll be raised to four after six months.  The\nhighest pay's five.\"\n\n\"Three dollars,\" said Susan.  \"How much can I rent a room for?\"\n\nThe restaurant girl looked at her pityingly.  \"Oh, you can't\nafford a room.  You'll have to club in with three other girls and\ntake a room together, and cook your meals yourselves, turn about.\"\n\nSusan tried not to show how gloomy this prospect seemed.  \"I'll\ntry,\" said she.\n\nShe paid the ten cents; her new acquaintance went with her to\nthe door, pointed out the huge bare wooden building displaying\nin great letters \"J. C. Matson, Paper Boxes.\"\n\n\"You apply at the office,\" said the waitress.  \"There'll be a fat\nblack-complected man in his shirt with his suspenders let down off\nhis shoulders.  He'll be fresh with you.  He used to be a working\nman himself, so he hasn't any respect for working people.  But he\ndoesn't mean any harm.  He isn't like a good many; he lets his\ngirls alone.\"\n\nSusan had not got far when the waitress came running after her.\n\"Won't you come back and let me know how you made out?\" she\nasked, a little embarrassed.  \"I hope you don't think I'm fresh.\"\n\n\"I'll be glad to come,\" Susan assured her.  And their eyes met in\na friendly glance.\n\n\"If you don't find a place to go, why not come in with me?  I've\ngot only a very little bit of a room, but it's as big and a lot\ncleaner than any you'll find with the factory girls.\"\n\n\"But I haven't any money,\" said Susan regretfully.  \"And I\ncouldn't take anything without paying.\"\n\n\"You could pay two dollars and a half a week and eat in with us.\nWe couldn't afford to give you much for that, but it'd be better\nthan what you'd get the other way.\"\n\n\"But you can't afford to do that.\"\n\nThe restaurant girl's mind was aroused, was working fast and\nwell.  \"You can help in the restaurant of evenings,\" she promptly\nreplied.  \"I'll tell ma you're so pretty you'll draw trade.  And\nI'll explain that you used to go to school with me--and have\nlost your father and mother.  My name's Etta Brashear.\"\n\n\"Mine's--Lorna Sackville,\" said Susan, blushing.  \"I'll come after\na while, and we'll talk about what to do.  I may not get a place.\"\n\n\"Oh, you'll get it.  He has hard work finding girls.  Factories\nusually pay more than stores, because the work's more looked\ndown on--though Lord knows it's hard to think how anything could\nbe more looked down on than a saleslady.\"\n\n\"I don't see why you bother about those things.  What do they matter?\"\n\n\"Why, everybody bothers about them.  But you don't understand.\nYou were born a lady, and you'll always feel you've got social\nstanding, and people'll feel that way too.\"\n\n\"But I wasn't,\" said Susan earnestly.  \"Indeed, I wasn't.  I was\nborn--a--a nobody.  I can't tell you, but I'm just nobody.  I\nhaven't even got a name.\"\n\nEtta, as romantic as the next young girl, was only the more\nfascinated by the now thrillingly mysterious stranger--so\npretty, so sweet, with such beautiful manners and strangely\noutcast no doubt from some family of \"high folks.\" \"You'll be\nsure to come?  You won't disappoint me?\"\n\nSusan kissed Etta.  Etta embraced Susan, her cheeks flushed, her\neyes brilliant.  \"'I've taken an awful fancy to you,\" she said.\n\"I haven't ever had an intimate lady friend.  I don't care for\nthe girls round here.  They're so fresh and common.  Ma brought me\nup refined; she's not like the ordinary working-class woman.\"\n\nIt hurt Susan deeply--why, she could not have quite\nexplained--to hear Etta talk in this fashion.  And in spite of\nherself her tone was less friendly as she said, \"I'll come when\nI find out.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nIN the office of the factory Susan found the man Etta described.\nHe was seated, or, rather, was sprawled before an open and\noverflowing rolltop desk, his collar and cuffs off, and his coat\nand waistcoat also.  His feet--broad, thick feet with knots at\nthe great toe joints bulging his shoes--were hoisted upon the\nleaf of the desk.  Susan's charms of person and manners so\nwrought upon him that, during the exchange of preliminary\nquestions and answers, he slowly took down first one foot then\nthe other, and readjusted his once muscular but now loose and\npudgy body into a less loaferish posture.  He was as unconscious\nas she of the cause and meaning of these movements.  Had he\nawakened to what he was doing he would probably have been\nangered against himself and against her; and the direction of\nSusan Lenox's life would certainly have been changed.  Those who\nfancy the human animal is in the custody of some conscious and\npredetermining destiny think with their vanity rather than with\ntheir intelligence.  A careful look at any day or even hour of\nany life reveals the inevitable influence of sheer accidents,\nmost of them trivial.  And these accidents, often the most\ntrivial, most powerfully determine not only the direction but\nalso the degree and kind of force--what characteristics shall\ndevelop and what shall dwindle.\n\n\"You seem to have a nut on you,\" said the box manufacturer at\nthe end of the examination.  \"I'll start you at three.\"\n\nSusan, thus suddenly \"placed\" in the world and ticketed with a\nreal value, was so profoundly excited that she could not even\nmake a stammering attempt at expressing gratitude.\n\n\"Do your work well,\" continued Matson, \"and you'll have a good\nsteady job with me till you get some nice young fellow to\nsupport you.  Stand the boys off.  Don't let 'em touch you till\nyou're engaged--and not much then till the preacher's said the word.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Susan, trying to look grave.  She was\nfascinated by his curious habit of scratching himself as he\ntalked--head, ribs, arm, legs, the backs of his red hairy hands.\n\n\"Stand 'em off,\" pursued the box-maker, scratching his ribs and\nnodding his huge head vigorously.  \"That's the way my wife got\nme.  It's pull Dick pull devil with the gals and the boys.  And\nthe gal that's stiff with the men gets a home, while her that\nain't goes to the streets.  I always gives my gals a word of good\nadvice.  And many a one I've saved.  There's mighty few preachers\ndoes as much good as me.  When can you go to work?\"\n\nSusan reflected.  With heightened color and a slight stammer she\nsaid, \"I've got something to do this afternoon, if you'll let\nme.  Can I come in the morning?\"\n\"Seven sharp.  We take off a cent a minute up to a quarter of an\nhour.  If you're later than that, you get docked for the day.  And\nno excuses.  I didn't climb to the top from spittoon cleaner in\na saloon fifteen years ago by being an easy mark for my hands.\"\n\n\"I'll come at seven in the morning,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Do you live far?\"\n\n\"I'm going to live just up the street.\"\n\n\"That's right.  It adds ten cents a day to your wages--the ten\nyou'll save in carfare.  Sixty cents a week!\" And Matson beamed\nand scratched as if he felt he had done a generous act.  \"Who are\nyou livin' with?  Respectable, I hope.\"\n\n\"With Miss Brashear--I think.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--Tom Brashear's gal.  They're nice people.  Tom's an\nhonest fellow--used to make good money till he had his hard\nluck.  Him and me used to work together.  But he never could seem\nto learn that it ain't workin' for yourself but makin' others\nwork for you that climbs a man up.  I never was much as a worker.\nI was always thinkin' out ways of makin' people work for me.  And\nhere I am at the top.  And where's Tom?  Well--run along\nnow--what's your name?\"\n\n\"Lorna Sackville.\"\n\n\"Lorny.\" He burst into a loud guffaw.  \"Lord, what a name!  Sounds\nlike a theayter.  Seven sharp, Lorny.  So long.\"\n\nSusan nodded with laughing eyes, thanked him and departed.  She\nglanced up the street, saw Etta standing in the door of the\nrestaurant.  Etta did not move from her own doorway, though she\nwas showing every sign of anxiety and impatience.  \"I can't leave\neven for a minute so near the dinner hour,\" she explained when\nSusan came, \"or I'd, a' been outside the factory.  And ma's got\nto stick to the kitchen.  I see you got a job.  How much?\"\n\n\"Three,\" replied Susan.\n\n\"He must have offered it to you,\" said Etta, laughing.  \"I\nthought about it after you were gone and I knew you'd take\nwhatever he said first.  Oh, I've been so scared something'd\nhappen.  I do want you as my lady friend.  Was he fresh?\"\n\n\"Not a bit.  He was--very nice.\"\n\n\"Well, he ought to be nice--as pa says, getting richer and\nricher, and driving the girls he robs to marry men they hate or\nto pick up a living in the gutter.\"\n\nSusan felt that she owed her benefactor a strong protest.  \"Maybe\nI'm foolish,\" said she, \"but I'm awful glad he's got that place\nand can give me work.\"\n\nEtta was neither convinced nor abashed.  \"You don't understand\nthings in our class,\" replied she.  \"Pa says it was the kind of\ngrateful thinking and talking you've just done that's made him\npoor in his old age.  He says you've either got to whip or be\nwhipped, rob or be robbed--and that the really good honest\npeople are the fools who take the losing side.  But he says, too,\nhe'd rather be a fool and a failure than stoop to stamping on\nhis fellow-beings and robbing them.  And I guess he's\nright\"--there Etta laughed--\"though I'll admit I'd hate to be\ntempted with a chance to get up by stepping on somebody.\" She\nsighed.  \"And sometimes I can't help wishing pa had done some\ntramping and stamping.  Why not?  That's all most people are fit\nfor--to be tramped and stamped on.  Now, don't look so shocked.\nYou don't understand.  Wait till you've been at work a while.\"\n\nSusan changed the subject.  \"I'm going to work at seven in the\nmorning. . . .  I might as well have gone today.  I had a kind of\nan engagement I thought I was going to keep, but I've about\ndecided I won't.\"\n\nEtta watched with awe and delight the mysterious look in Susan's\nsuddenly flushed face and abstracted eyes.  After a time she\nventured to interrupt with:\n\n\"You'll try living with us?\"\n\n\"If you're quite sure--did you talk to your mother?\"\n\n\"Mother'll be crazy about you.  She wants anything that'll make\nme more contented.  Oh, I do get so lonesome!\"\n\nMrs. Brashear, a spare woman, much bent by monotonous\nwork--which, however, had not bent her courage or her\ncheerfulness--made Susan feel at home immediately in the little\nflat.  The tenement was of rather a superior class.  But to Susan\nit seemed full of noisome smells, and she was offended by the\nhalls littered with evidences of the uncleanness of the tenants.\nShe did not then realize that the apparent superior cleanness\nand neatness of the better-off classes was really in large part\nonly affected, that their secluded back doors and back ways gave\nthem opportunity to hide their uncivilized habits from the world\nthat saw only the front.  However, once inside the Brashear flat,\nshe had an instant rise of spirits.\n\n\"Isn't this nice?\" exclaimed she as Etta showed her, at a glance\nfrom the sitting-room, the five small but scrupulously clean\nrooms.  \"I'll like it here!\"\n\nEtta reddened, glanced at her for signs of mockery, saw that she\nwas in earnest.  \"I'm afraid it's better to look at than to live\nin,\" she began, then decided against saying anything discouraging.\n\"It seems cramped to us,\" said she, \"after the house we had till\na couple of years ago.  I guess we'll make out, somehow.\"\n\nThe family paid twenty dollars a month for the flat.  The\nrestaurant earned twelve to fifteen a week; and the son, Ashbel,\nstocky, powerful and stupid, had a steady job as porter at ten\na week.  He gave his mother seven, as he had a room to himself\nand an enormous appetite.  He talked of getting married; if he\ndid marry, the family finances would be in disorder.  But his\ngirl had high ideas, being the daughter of a grocer who fancied\nhimself still an independent merchant though he was in fact the\neven more poorly paid selling agent of the various food products\ntrusts.  She had fixed twenty a week as the least on which she\nwould marry; his prospects of any such raise were--luckily for\nhis family--extremely remote; for he had nothing but physical\nstrength to sell, and the price of physical strength alone was\ngoing down, under immigrant competition, not only in actual wages\nlike any other form of wage labor, but also in nominal wages.\n\nAltogether, the Brashears were in excellent shape for a tenement\nfamily, were better off than upwards of ninety per cent of the\nfamilies of prosperous and typical Cincinnati.  While it was true\nthat old Tom Brashear drank, it was also true that he carefully\nlimited himself to two dollars a week.  While it was true that he\ncould not work at his trade and apparently did little but sit\nround and talk--usually high above his audience--nevertheless he\nwas the actual head of the family and its chief bread-winner.  It\nwas his savings that were invested in the restaurant; he bought\nthe supplies and was shrewd and intelligent about that vitally\nimportant department of the business--the department whose\nmismanagement in domestic economy is, next to drink, the main\ncause of failure and pauperism, of sickness, of premature\ndisability, of those profound discouragements that lead to\ndespair.  Also, old Brashear had the sagacity and the nagging\nhabit that are necessary to keeping people and things up to the\nmark.  He had ideas--practical ideas as well as ideals--far above\nhis station.  But for him the housekeeping would have been in the\nfamiliar tenement fashion of slovenliness and filth, and the\nfamily would have been neat only on Sundays, and only on the\nsurface then.  Because he had the habit of speaking of himself as\nuseless, as done for, as a drag, as one lingering on when he\nought to be dead, his family and all the neighborhood thought of\nhim in that way.  Although intelligence, indeed, virtue of every\nkind, is expected of tenement house people--and is needed by\nthem beyond any other condition of humanity--they are\nunfortunately merely human, are tainted of all human weaknesses.\nThey lack, for instance, discrimination.  So, it never occurred\nto them that Tom Brashear was the sole reason why the Brashears\nlived better than any of the other families and yielded less to\nthe ferocious and incessant downward pressure.\n\nBut for one thing the Brashears would have been going up in the\nworld.  That thing was old Tom's honesty.  The restaurant gave\ngood food and honest measure.  Therefore, the margin of profit\nwas narrow--too narrow.  He knew what was the matter.  He mocked\nat himself for being \"such a weak fool\" when everybody else with\nthe opportunity and the intelligence was getting on by yielding\nto the compulsion of the iron rule of dishonesty in business.\nBut he remained honest--therefore, remained in the working\nclass, instead of rising among its exploiters.\n\n\"If I didn't drink, I'd kill myself,\" said old Tom to Susan,\nwhen he came to know her well and to feel that from her he could\nget not the mere blind admiration the family gave him but\nunderstanding and sympathy.  \"Whenever anybody in the working\nclass has any imagination,\" he explained, \"he either kicks his\nway out of it into capitalist or into criminal--or else he takes\nto drink.  I ain't mean enough to be either a capitalist or a\ncriminal.  So, I've got to drink.\"\n\nSusan only too soon began to appreciate from her own experience\nwhat he meant.\n\nIn the first few days the novelty pleased her, made her think\nshe was going to be contented.  The new friends and\nacquaintances, different from any she had known, the new sights,\nthe new way of living--all this interested her, even when it\nshocked one or many of her senses and sensibilities.  But the\nnovelty of folding and pasting boxes, of the queer new kind of\ngirls who worked with her, hardly survived into the second week.\nShe saw that she was among a people where the highest known\nstandard--the mode of life regarded by them as the acme of\nelegance and bliss--the best they could conceive was far, far\nbelow what she had been brought up to believe the scantest\nnecessities of respectable and civilized living.  She saw this\nlife from the inside now--as the comfortable classes never permit\nthemselves to see it if they can avoid.  She saw that to be a\ncontented working girl, to look forward to the prospect of being\na workingman's wife, a tenement housekeeper and mother, a woman\nmust have been born to it--and born with little brains--must\nhave been educated for it, and for nothing else.  Etta was\nbitterly discontented; yet after all it was a vague endurable\ndiscontent.  She had simply heard of and dreamed of and from afar\noff--chiefly through novels and poems and the theater--had\nglimpsed a life that was broader, that had comfort and luxury,\npeople with refined habits and manners.  Susan had not merely\nheard of such a life; she had lived it--it, and no other.\n\nAlways of the thoughtful temperament, she had been rapidly\ndeveloped first by Burlingham and now by Tom Brashear--had been\ntaught not only how to think but also how to gather the things\nto think about.\n\nWith a few exceptions the girls at the factory were woefully\nunclean about their persons.  Susan did not blame them; she only\nwondered at Etta the more, and grew to admire her--and the\nfather who held the whole family up to the mark.  For, in spite\nof the difficulties of getting clean, without bathtub, without\nany but the crudest and cheapest appliances for cleanliness,\nwithout any leisure time, Etta kept herself in perfect order.\nThe show boat and the quarters at the hotel had been trying to\nSusan.  But they had seemed an adventure, a temporary, passing\nphase, a sort of somewhat prolonged camping-out lark.  Now, she\nwas settled down, to live, apparently for the rest of her life,\nwith none of the comforts, with few of the decencies.  What Etta\nand her people, using all their imagination, would have pictured\nas the pinnacle of luxury would have been for Susan a small and\nimperfect part of what she had been bred to regard as \"living\ndecently.\" She suspected that but for Etta's example she would\nbe yielding, at least in the matter of cleanliness, when the\nstruggle against dirt was so unequal, was thankless.\nDiscouragement became her frequent mood; she wondered if the\ntime would not come when it would be her fixed habit, as it was\nwith all but a handful of those about her.\n\nSometimes she and Etta walked in the quarter at the top of the\nhill where lived the families of prosperous\nmerchants--establishments a little larger, a little more\npretentious than her Uncle George's in Sutherland, but on the\nwhole much like it--the houses of the solid middle class which\nfancies itself grandly luxurious where it is in fact merely\ncomfortable in a crude unimaginative way.  Susan was one of those\nwho are born with the instinct and mental bent for luxurious\ncomfort; also, she had the accompanying peculiar talent for\nassimilating ideas about food and dress and surroundings from\nbooks and magazines, from the study of well-dressed people in\nthe street, from glances into luxurious interiors through\nwindows or open doors as she passed by.  She saw with even\nquicker and more intelligently critical eyes the new thing, the\ngood idea, the improvement on what she already knew.  Etta's\nexcitement over these commonplace rich people amused her.  She\nherself, on the wings of her daring young fancy, could soar into\na realm of luxury, of beauty and exquisite comfort, that made\nthese self-complacent mansions seem very ordinary indeed.  It was\nno drag upon her fancy, but the reverse, that she was sharing a\nnarrow bed and a narrow room in a humble and tiny tenement flat.\n\nOn one of these walks Etta confided to her the only romance of\nher life therefore the real cause of her deep discontent.  It was\na young man from one of these houses--a flirtation lasting about\na year.  She assured Susan it was altogether innocent.\nSusan--perhaps chiefly because Etta protested so insistently\nabout her unsullied purity--had her doubts.\n\n\"Then,\" said Etta, \"when I saw that he didn't care anything\nabout me except in one way--I didn't see him any more.  I--I've\nbeen sorry ever since.\"\n\nSusan did not offer the hoped-for sympathy.  She was silent.\n\n\"Did you ever have anything like that happen to you?\" inquired Etta.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan.  \"Something like that.\"\n\n\"And what did you do?\"\n\n\"I didn't want to see him any more.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I don't know--exactly.\n\n\"And you like him?\"\n\n\"I think I would have liked him.\"\n\n\"You're sorry you stopped?\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" replied she, hesitatingly.\n\nShe was beginning to be afraid that she would soon be sorry all\nthe time.  Every day the war within burst forth afresh.  She\nreproached herself for her growing hatred of her life.  Ought she\nnot to be grateful that she had so much--that she was not one of\na squalid quartette in a foul, vermin-infested back\nbedroom--infested instead of only occasionally visited--that she\nwas not a streetwalker, diseased, prowling in all weathers, the\nprey of the coarse humors of contemptuous and usually drunken\nbeasts; that she was not living where everyone about her would,\nby pity or out of spitefulness, tear open the wounds of that\nhideous brand which had been put upon her at birth?  Above all,\nshe ought to be thankful that she was not Jeb Ferguson's wife.\n\nBut her efforts to make herself resigned and contented, to kill\nher doubts as to the goodness of \"goodness,\" were not\nsuccessful.  She had Tom Brashear's \"ungrateful\" nature--the\nnature that will not let a man or a woman stay in the class of\nhewers of wood and drawers of water but drives him or her out of\nit--and up or down.\n\n\"You're one of those that things happen to,\" the old\ncabinetmaker said to her on a September evening, as they sat on\nthe sidewalk in front of the restaurant.  The tenements had\ndischarged their swarms into the hot street, and there was that\nlively panorama of dirt and disease and depravity which is\nfascinating--to unaccustomed eyes.  \"Yes,\" said Tom, \"things'll\nhappen to you.\"\n\n\"What--for instance?\" she asked.\n\n\"God only knows.  You'll up and do something some day.  You're\nsettin' here just to grow wings.  Some day--swish!--and off you'll\nsoar.  It's a pity you was born female.  Still--there's a lot of\nfemales that gets up.  Come to think of it, I guess sex don't\nmatter.  It's havin' the soul--and mighty few of either sex has it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm like everybody else,\" said the girl with an impatient\nsigh.  \"I dream, but--it doesn't come to anything.\"\n\n\"No, you ain't like everybody else,\" retorted he, with a\npositive shake of his finely shaped head, thatched superbly with\nwhite hair.  \"You ain't afraid, for instance.  That's the\nprincipal sign of a great soul, I guess.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I _am_ afraid,\" cried Susan.  \"I've only lately found out\nwhat a coward I am.\"\n\n\"You think you are,\" said the cabinetmaker.  \"There's them that's\nafraid to do, and don't do.  Then there's them that's afraid to\ndo, but goes ahead and does anyhow.  That's you.  I don't know\nwhere you came from--oh, I heard Etta's accountin' for you to\nher ma, but that's neither here nor there.  I don't know where\nyou come from, and I don't know where you're going.  But--you\nain't afraid--and you have imagination--and those two signs\nmeans something doing.\"\n\nSusan shook her head dejectedly; it had been a cruelly hard day\nat the factory and the odors from the girls working on either\nside of her had all but overwhelmed her.\n\nOld Tom nodded with stronger emphasis.  \"You're too young, yet,\"\nhe said.  \"And not licked into shape.  But wait a while.  You'll\nget there.\"\n\nSusan hoped so, but doubted it.  There was no time to work at\nthese large problems of destiny when the daily grind was so\ncompelling, so wearing, when the problems of bare food, clothing\nand shelter took all there was in her.\n\nFor example, there was the matter of clothes.  She had come with\nonly what she was wearing.  She gave the Brashears every Saturday\ntwo dollars and a half of her three and was ashamed of herself\nfor taking so much for so little, when she learned about the\ncost of living and how different was the food the Brashears had\nfrom that of any other family in those quarters!  As soon as she\nhad saved four dollars from her wages--it took nearly two\nmonths--she bought the necessary materials and made herself two\nplain outer skirts, three blouses and three pairs of drawers.\nChemises and corset covers she could not afford.  She bought a\npair of shoes for a dollar, two pairs of stockings for thirty\ncents, a corset for eighty cents, an umbrella for half a dollar,\ntwo underwaists for a quarter.  She bought an untrimmed hat for\nthirty-five cents and trimmed it with the cleaned ribbon from\nher summer sailor and a left over bit of skirt material.  She\nalso made herself a jacket that had to serve as wrap too--and\nthe materials for this took the surplus of her wages for another\nmonth.  The cold weather had come, and she had to walk fast when\nshe was in the open air not to be chilled to the bone.  Her Aunt\nFanny had been one of those women, not too common in America,\nwho understand and practice genuine economy in the\nhousehold--not the shabby stinginess that passes for economy but\nthe laying out of money to the best advantage that comes only\nwhen one knows values.  This training stood Susan in good stead\nnow.  It saved her from disaster--from disintegration.\n\nShe and Etta did some washing every night, hanging the things on\nthe fire escape to dry.  In this way she was able to be clean;\nbut in appearance she looked as poor as she was.  She found a\ncobbler who kept her shoes in fair order for a few cents; but\nnothing was right about them soon--except that they were not\ndown at the heel.  She could recall how she had often wondered\nwhy the poor girls at Sutherland showed so little taste, looked\nso dowdy.  She wondered at her own stupidity, at the narrowness\nof an education, such as hers had been, an education that left\nher ignorant of the conditions of life as it was lived by all\nbut a lucky few of her fellow beings.\n\n\nHow few the lucky!  What an amazing world--what a strange\ncreation the human race!  How was it possible that the lucky few,\namong whom she had been born and bred, should know so little,\nreally nothing, about the lot of the vast mass of their fellows,\nliving all around them, close up against them?  \"If I had only\nknown!\" she thought.  And then she reflected that, if she had\nknown, pleasure would have been impossible.  She could see her\nbureau drawers, her closets at home.  She had thought herself not\nany too well off.  Now, how luxurious, how stuffed with shameful,\nwasteful unnecessaries those drawers and closets seemed!\n\nAnd merely to keep herself in underclothes that were at least\nnot in tatters she had to spend every cent over and above her\nboard.  If she had had to pay carfare ten cents a day, sixty\ncents a week!--as did many of the girls who lived at home, she\nwould have been ruined.  She understood now why every girl\nwithout a family back of her, and without good prospect of\nmarriage, was revolving the idea of becoming a streetwalker--not\nas a hope, but as a fear.  As she learned to observe more\nclosely, she found good reasons for suspecting that from time to\ntime the girls who became too hard pressed relieved the tension\nby taking to the streets on Saturday and Sunday nights.  She read\nin the _Commercial_ one noon--Mr. Matson sometimes left his paper\nwhere she could glance through it--she read an article on\nworking girls, how they were seduced to lives of shame--by love\nof _finery_!  Then she read that those who did not fall were\nrestrained by religion and innate purity.  There she\nlaughed--bitterly.  Fear of disease, fear of maternity, yes.  But\nwhere was this religion?  Who but the dullest fools in the throes\nof that bare and tortured life ever thought of God?  As for the\npurity--what about the obscene talk that made her shudder\nbecause of its sheer filthy stupidity?--what about the frank\nshamelessness of the efforts to lure their \"steadies\" into\nspeedy matrimony by using every charm of caress and of person to\ninflame passion without satisfying it?  She had thought she knew\nabout the relations of the sexes when she came to live and work\nin that tenement quarter.  Soon her knowledge had seemed\nignorance beside the knowledge of the very babies.\n\nIt was a sad, sad puzzle.  If one ought to be good--chaste and\nclean in mind and body--then, why was there the most tremendous\npressure on all but a few to make them as foul as the\nsurroundings in which they were compelled to live?  If it was\nwiser to be good, then why were most people imprisoned in a life\nfrom which they could escape only by being bad?  What was this\nthing comfortable people had set up as good, anyhow--and what\nwas bad?  She found no answer.  How could God condemn anyone for\nanything they did in the torments of the hell that life revealed\nitself to her as being, after a few weeks of its moral, mental\nand physical horrors?  Etta's father was right; those who\nrealized what life really was and what it might be, those who\nwere sensitive took to drink or went to pieces some other way,\nif they were gentle, and if they were cruel, committed any\nbrutality, any crime to try to escape.\n\nIn former days Susan thought well of charity, as she had been\ntaught.  Old Tom Brashear gave her a different point of view.  One\nday he insulted and drove from the tenement some pious\ncharitable people who had come down from the fashionable hilltop\nto be good and gracious to their \"less fashionable\nfellow-beings.\" After they had gone he explained his harshness\nto Susan:\n\n\"That's the only way you can make them slicked-up brutes feel,\"\nsaid he, \"they're so thick in the hide and satisfied with\nthemselves.  What do they come here for!  To do good!  Yes--to\nthemselves.  To make themselves feel how generous and sweet they\nwas.  Well, they'd better go home and read their Russia-leather\ncovered Bibles.  They'd find out that when God wanted to really\ndo something for man, he didn't have himself created a king, or\na plutocrat, or a fat, slimy church deacon in a fashionable\nchurch.  No, he had himself born a bastard in a manger.\"\n\nSusan shivered, for the truth thus put sounded like sacrilege.\nThen a glow--a glow of pride and of hope--swept through her.\n\n\"If you ever get up into another class,\" went on old Tom, \"don't\ncome hangin' round the common people you'll be livin' off of and\nhelpin' to grind down; stick to your own class.  That's the only\nplace anybody can do any good--any real helpin' and lovin', man\nto man, and woman to woman.  If you want to help anybody that's\ndown, pull him up into your class first.  Stick to your class.\nYou'll find plenty to do there.\"\n\n\"What, for instance?\" asked Susan.  She understood a little of\nwhat he had in mind, but was still puzzled.\n\n\"Them stall-fed fakers I just threw out,\" the old man went on.\n\"They come here, actin' as if this was the Middle Ages and the\nlord of the castle was doin' a fine thing when he went down\namong the low peasants who'd been made by God to work for the\nlords.  But this ain't the Middle Ages.  What's the truth about it?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" confessed Susan.\n\n\"Why, the big lower class is poor because the little upper class\ntakes away from 'em and eats up all they toil and slave to make.\nOh, it ain't the upper class's fault.  They do it because they're\nignorant more'n because they're bad, just as what goes on down\nhere is ignorance more'n badness.  But they do it, all the same.\nAnd they're ignorant and need to be told.  Supposin' you saw a\nbig girl out yonder in the street beatin' her baby sister.  What\nwould you do?  Would you go and hold out little pieces of candy\nto the baby and say how sorry you was for her?  Or would you\nfirst grab hold of that big sister and throw her away from\nbeatin' of the baby?\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Susan.\n\n\"That's it exactly,\" exclaimed the old man, in triumph.  \"And I\nsay to them pious charity fakers, 'Git the hell out of here\nwhere you can't do no good.  Git back to yer own class that makes\nall this misery, makes it faster'n all the religion and charity\nin the world could help it.  Git back to yer own class and work\nwith them, and teach them and make them stop robbin' and beatin'\nthe baby.'\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the girl, \"you are right.  I see it now.  But, Mr.\nBrashear, they meant well.\"\n\n\"The hell they did,\" retorted the old man.  \"If they'd, a' had\nlove in their hearts, they'd have seen the truth.  Love's one of\nthe greatest teachers in the world.  If they'd, a' meant well,\nthey'd, a' been goin' round teachin' and preachin' and prayin'\nat their friends and fathers and brothers, the plutocrats.\nThey'd never 'a' come down here, pretendin' they was doin' good,\nkillin' one bedbug out of ten million and offerin' one pair of\ngood pants where a hundred thousand pairs is needed.  They'd\nbetter go read about themselves in their Bible--what Jesus says.\nHe knew 'em.  _He_ belonged to _us_--and _they_ crucified him.\"\n\nThe horrors of that by no means lowest tenement region, its\nhorrors for a girl bred as Susan had been!  Horrors moral,\nhorrors mental, horrors physical--above all, the physical\nhorrors; for, worse to her than the dull wits and the lack of\neducation, worse than vile speech and gesture, was the hopeless\nbattle against dirt, against the vermin that could crawl\neverywhere--and did.  She envied the ignorant and the insensible\ntheir lack of consciousness of their own plight--like the\ndisemboweled horse that eats tranquilly on.  At first she had\nthought her unhappiness came from her having been used to better\nthings, that if she had been born to this life she would have\nbeen content, gay at times.  Soon she learned that laughter does\nnot always mean mirth; that the ignorant do not lack the power\nto suffer simply because they lack the power to appreciate; that\nthe diseases, the bent bodies, the harrowed faces, the\ndrunkenness, quarreling, fighting, were safer guides to the real\nconditions of these people than their occasional guffaws and\nfits of horseplay.\n\nA woman from the hilltop came in a carriage to see about a\nservant.  On her way through the hall she cried out:  \"Gracious!\nWhy don't these lazy creatures clean up, when soap costs so\nlittle and water nothing at all!\" Susan heard, was moved to face\nher fiercely, but restrained herself.  Of what use?  How could the\nwoman understand, if she heard, \"But, you fool, where are we to\nget the time to clean up?--and where the courage?--and would soap\nenough to clean up and keep clean cost so little, when every\npenny means a drop of blood?\"\n\n\"If they only couldn't drink so much!\" said Susan to Tom.\n\n\"What, then?\" retorted he.  \"Why, pretty soon wages'd be cut\nfaster than they was when street carfares went down from ten\ncents to five.  Whenever the workin' people arrange to live\ncheaper and to try to save something, down goes wages.  No, they\nmight as well drink.  It helps 'em bear it and winds 'em up\nsooner.  I tell you, it ain't the workin' people's fault--it's\nthe bosses, now.  It's the system--the system.  A new form of\nslavery, this here wage system--and it's got to go--like the\nslaveholder that looked so copper-riveted and Bible-backed in\nits day.\"\n\n\nThat idea of \"the system\" was beyond Susan.  But not what her\neyes saw, and her ears heard, and her nose smelled, and her\nsense of touch shrank from.  No ambition and no reason for\nambition.  No real knowledge, and no chance to get any--neither\nthe leisure nor the money nor the teachers.  No hope, and no\nreason for hope.  No God--and no reason for a God.\n\nIdeas beyond her years, beyond her comprehension, were stirring\nin her brain, were making her grave and thoughtful.  She was\naccumulating a store of knowledge about life; she was groping\nfor the clew to its mystery, for the missing fact or facts which\nwould enable her to solve the puzzle, to see what its lessons\nwere for her.  Sometimes her heavy heart told her that the\nmystery was plain and the lesson easy--hopelessness.  For of all\nthe sadness about her, of all the tragedies so sordid and\nunromantic, the most tragic was the hopelessness.  It would be\nimpossible to conceive people worse off; it would be impossible\nto conceive _these_ people better off.  They were such a\nmultitude that only they could save themselves--and they had no\nintelligence to appreciate, no desire to impel.  If their\nmiseries--miseries to which they had fallen heir at birth--had\nmade them what they were, it was also true that they were what\nthey were--hopeless, down to the babies playing in the filth.  An\nunscalable cliff; at the top, in pleasant lands, lived the\ncomfortable classes; at the bottom lived the masses--and while\nmany came whirling down from the top, how few found their way up!\n\nOn a Saturday night Ashbel came home with the news that his\nwages had been cut to seven dollars.  And the restaurant had been\npaying steadily less as the hard times grew harder and the cost\nof unadulterated and wholesome food mounted higher and higher.\nAs the family sat silent and stupefied, old Tom looked up from\nhis paper, fixed his keen, mocking eyes on Susan.\n\n\"I see, here,\" said he, \"that _we_ are so rich that they want to\nraise the President's salary so as he can entertain\n_decently_--and to build palaces at foreign courts so as our\nrepresentatives'll live worthy of _us_!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nON Monday at the lunch hour--or, rather, half-hour--Susan\nventured in to see the boss.\n\nMatson had too recently sprung from the working class and was\ntoo ignorant of everything outside his business to have made\nradical changes in his habits.  He smoked five-cent cigars\ninstead of \"twofurs\"; he ate larger quantities of food, did not\nstint himself in beer or in treating his friends in the evenings\ndown at Wielert's beer garden.  Also he wore a somewhat better\nquality of clothing; but he looked precisely what he was.  Like\nall the working class above the pauper line, he made a Sunday\ntoilet, the chief features of which were the weekly bath and the\nweekly clean white shirt.  Thus, it being only Monday morning, he\nwas looking notably clean when Susan entered--and was morally\nwound up to a higher key than he would be as the week wore on.\nAt sight of her his feet on the leaf of the desk wavered, then\nbecame inert; it would not do to put on manners with any of the\n\"hands.\" Thanks to the bath, he was not exuding his usual odor\nthat comes from bolting much strong, cheap food.\n\n\"Well, Lorny--what's the kick?\" inquired he with his amiable\ngrin.  His rise in the world never for an instant ceased to be a\nsource of delight to him; it--and a perfect digestion--kept him\nin a good humor all the time.\n\n\"I want to know,\" stammered Susan, \"if you can't give me a\nlittle more money.\"\n\nHe laughed, eyeing her approvingly.  Her clothing was that of the\nworking girl; but in her face was the look never found in those\nborn to the modern form of slavery-wage servitude.  If he had\nbeen \"cultured\" he might have compared her to an enslaved\nprincess, though in fact that expression of her courageous\nviolet-gray eyes and sensitive mouth could never have been in\nthe face of princess bred to the enslaving routine of the most\nconventional of conventional lives; it could come only from\nsheer erectness of spirit, the exclusive birthright of the sons\nand daughters of democracy.\n\n\"More money!\" he chuckled.  \"You _have_ got a nerve!--when\nfactories are shutting down everywhere and working people are\ntramping the streets in droves.\"\n\n\"I do about one-fourth more than the best hands you've got,\"\nreplied Susan, made audacious by necessity.  \"And I'll agree to\nthrow in my lunch time.\"\n\n\"Let me see, how much do you get?\"\n\n\"Three dollars.\"\n\n\"And you aren't living at home.  You must have a hard time.  Not\nmuch over for diamonds, eh?  You want to hustle round and get\nmarried, Lorny.  Looks don't last long when a gal works.  But\nyou're holdin' out better'n them that gads and dances all night.\"\n\n\"I help at the restaurant in the evening to piece out my board.\nI'm pretty tired when I get a chance to go to bed.\"\n\n\"I'll bet!. . .  So, you want more money.  I've been watchin'\nyou.  I watch all my gals--I have to, to keep weedin' out the\nfast ones.  I won't have no bad examples in _my_ place!  As soon as\nI ketch a gal livin' beyond her wages I give her the bounce.\"\n\nSusan lowered her eyes and her cheeks burned--not because Matson\nwas frankly discussing the frivolous subject of sex.  Another\ngirl might have affected the air of distressed modesty, but it\nwould have been affectation, pure and simple, as in those\nregions all were used to hearing the frankest, vilest\nthings--and we do not blush at what we are used to hearing.\nStill, the tenement female sex is as full of affectation as is\nthe sex elsewhere.  But, Susan, the curiously self-unconscious,\nwas incapable of affectation.  Her indignation arose from her\nsense of the hideous injustice of Matson's discharging girls for\ndoing what his meager wages all but compelled.\n\n\"Yes, I've been watching you,\" he went on, \"with a kind of a\nsort of a notion of makin' you a forelady.  That'd mean six\ndollars a week.  But you ain't fit.  You've got the brains--plenty\nof 'em.  But you wouldn't be of no use to me as forelady.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Susan.  Six dollars a week!  Affluence!  Wealth!\n\nMatson took his feet down, relit his cigar and swung himself\ninto an oracular attitude.\n\n\"I'll show you.  What's manufacturin'?  Right down at the bottom,\nI mean.\" He looked hard at the girl.  She looked receptively at him.\n\n\"Why, it's gettin' work out of the hands.  New ideas is nothin'.\nYou can steal 'em the minute the other fellow uses 'em.  No, it's\nall in gettin' work out of the hands.\"\n\nSusan's expression suggested one who sees light and wishes to\nsee more of it.  He proceeded:\n\n\"You work for me--for instance, now, if every day you make stuff\nthere's a profit of five dollars on, I get five dollars out of\nyou.  If I can push you to make stuff there's a profit of six\ndollars on, I get six dollars--a dollar more.  Clear extra gain,\nisn't it?  Now multiply a dollar by the number of hands, and\nyou'll see what it amounts to.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Susan, nodding thoughtfully.\n\n\"Well!  How did I get up?  Because as a foreman I knew how to work\nthe hands.  I knew how to get those extra dollars.  And how do I\nkeep up?  Because I hire forepeople that get work out of the hands.\"\n\nSusan understood.  But her expression was a comment that was not\nmissed by the shrewd Matson.\n\n\"Now, listen to me, Lorny.  I want to give you a plain straight\ntalk because I'd like to see you climb.  Ever since you've been\nhere I've been laughin' to myself over the way your\nforelady--she's a fox, she is!--makes you the pacemaker for the\nother girls.  She squeezes at least twenty-five cents a day over\nwhat she used to out of each hand in your room because you're\nabove the rest of them dirty, shiftless muttonheads.\"\n\nSusan flushed at this fling at her fellow-workers.\n\n\"Dirty, shiftless muttonheads,\" repeated Matson.  \"Ain't I right?\nAin't they dirty?  Ain't they shiftless--so no-account that if\nthey wasn't watched every minute they'd lay down--and let me and\nthe factory that supports 'em go to rack and ruin?  And ain't\nthey muttonheads?  Do you ever find any of 'em saying or doing a\nsensible thing?\"\n\nSusan could not deny.  She could think of excuses--perfect\nexcuses.  But the facts were about as he brutally put it.\n\n\"Oh, I know 'em.  I've dealt with 'em all my life,\" pursued the\nbox manufacturer.  \"Now, Lorny, you ought to be a forelady.\nYou've got to toughen up and stop bein' so polite and helpful\nand all that.  You'll _never_ get on if you don't toughen up.\nBusiness is business.  Be as sentimental as you like away from\nbusiness, and after you've clum to the top.  But not _in_ business\nor while you're kickin' and scratchin' and clawin' your way up.\"\n\nSusan shook her head slowly.  She felt painfully young and\ninexperienced and unfit for the ferocious struggle called\nlife.  She felt deathly sick.\n\n\"Of course it's a hard world,\" said Matson with a wave of his\ncigar.  \"But did I make it?\"\n\n\"No,\" admitted Susan, as his eyes demanded a reply.\n\n\"Sure not,\" said he.  \"And how's anybody to get up in it?  Is\nthere any other way but by kickin' and stampin', eh?\"\n\n\"None that I see,\" conceded Susan reluctantly.\n\n\"None that is,\" declared he.  \"Them that says there's other ways\neither lies or don't know nothin' about the practical game.\nWell, then!\" Matson puffed triumphantly at the cigar.  \"Such\nbein' the case--and as long as the crowd down below's got to be\nkicked in the face by them that's on the way up, why shouldn't\nI do the kickin'--which is goin' to be done anyhow--instead of\ngettin' kicked?  Ain't that sense?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted Susan.  She sighed.  \"Yes,\" she repeated.\n\n\"Well--toughen up.  Meanwhile, I'll raise you, to spur the others\non.  I'll give you four a week.\" And he cut short her thanks with\nan \"Oh, don't mention it.  I'm only doin' what's square--what\nhelps me as well as you.  I want to encourage you.  You don't\nbelong down among them cattle.  Toughen up, Lorny.  A girl with\na bank account gets the pick of the beaux.\" And he nodded a\ndismissal.\n\nMatson, and his hands, bosses and workers, brutal, brutalizing\neach other more and more as they acted and reacted upon each\nother.  Where would it end?\n\nShe was in dire need of underclothes.  Her undershirts were full\nof holes from the rubbing of her cheap, rough corset; her\ndrawers and stockings were patched in several places--in fact,\nshe could not have worn the stockings had not her skirt now been\nwell below her shoetops.  Also, her shoes, in spite of the money\nshe had spent upon them, were about to burst round the edges of\nthe soles.  But she would not longer accept from the Brashears\nwhat she regarded as charity.\n\n\"You more than pay your share, what with the work you do,\"\nprotested Mrs. Brashear.  \"I'll not refuse the extra dollar\nbecause I've simply got to take it.  But I don't want to pertend.\"\n\nThe restaurant receipts began to fall with the increasing\nhardness of the times among the working people.  Soon it was down\nto practically no profit at all--that is, nothing toward the\nrent.  Tom Brashear was forced to abandon his policy of honesty,\nto do as all the other purveyors were doing--to buy cheap stuff\nand to cheapen it still further.  He broke abruptly with his\ntradition and his past.  It aged him horribly all in a few\nweeks--but, at least, ruin was put off.  Mrs. Brashear had to\ndraw twenty of the sixty-three dollars which were in the savings\nbank against sickness.  Funerals would be taken care of by the\nburial insurance; each member of the family, including Susan,\nhad a policy.  But sickness had to have its special fund; and it\nwas frequently drawn upon, as the Brashears knew no more than\ntheir neighbors about hygiene, and were constantly catching the\ncolds of foolish exposure or indigestion and letting them\ndevelop into fevers, bad attacks of rheumatism, stomach trouble,\nbackache all regarded by them as by their neighbors as a\nnecessary part of the routine of life.  Those tenement people had\nno more notion of self-restraint than had the \"better classes\"\nwhose self-indulgences maintain the vast army of doctors and\ndruggists.  The only thing that saved Susan from all but an\noccasional cold or sore throat from wet feet was eating little\nthrough being unable to accustom herself to the fare that was\nthe best the Brashears could now afford--cheap food in cheap\nlard, coarse and poisonous sugar, vilely adulterated coffee,\ndoctored meat and vegetables--the food which the poor in their\nignorance buy--and for which they in their helplessness pay\nactually higher prices than do intelligent well-to-do people for\nthe better qualities.  And not only were the times hard, but the\nwinter also.  Snow--sleet--rain--thaw--slush--noisome,\ndisease-laden vapor--and, of course, sickness everywhere--with\noccasional relief in death, relief for the one who died, relief\nfor the living freed from just so much of the burden.  The\nsickness on every hand appalled Susan.  Surely, she said to old\nBrashear, the like had never been before; on the contrary, said\nhe, the amount of illness and death was, if anything, less than\nusual because the hard times gave people less for eating and\ndrinking.  These ghastly creatures crawling toward the hospital\nor borne out on stretchers to the ambulance--these yet ghastlier\ncreatures tottering feebly homeward, discharged as cured--these\ncorpses of men, of women, of boys and girls, of babies--oh, how\nmany corpses of babies!--these corpses borne away for burial,\nusually to the public burying ground--all these stricken ones in\nthe battle ever waging, with curses, with hoarse loud laughter,\nwith shrieks and moans, with dull, drawn faces and jaws set--all\nthese stricken ones were but the ordinary losses of the battle!\n\n\"And in the churches,\" said old Tom Brashear, \"they preach the\ngoodness and mercy of God.  And in the papers they talk about how\nrich and prosperous we are.\"\n\n\"I don't care to live!  It is too horrible,\" cried the girl.\n\n\"Oh, you mustn't take things so to heart,\" counseled he.  \"Us\nthat live this life can't afford to take it to heart.  Leave that\nto them who come down here from the good houses and look on us\nfor a minute and enjoy themselves with a little weepin' and\nsighin' as if it was in the theater.\"\n\n\"It seems worse every, day,\" she said.  \"I try to fool myself,\nbecause I've got to stay and----\"\n\n\"Oh, no, you haven't,\" interrupted he.\n\nSusan looked at him with a startled expression.  It seemed to her\nthat the old man had seen into her secret heart where was daily\nraging the struggle against taking the only way out open to a\ngirl in her circumstances.  It seemed to her he was hinting that\nshe ought to take that way.\n\nIf any such idea was in his mind, he did not dare put it into\nwords.  He simply repeated:\n\n\"You won't stay.  You'll pull out.\"\n\n\"How?\" she asked.\n\n\"Somehow.  When the way opens you'll see it, and take it.\"\n\nThere had long since sprung up between these two a sympathy, a\nmutual understanding beyond any necessity of expression in words\nor looks.  She had never had this feeling for anyone, not even\nfor Burlingham.  This feeling for each other had been like that\nof a father and daughter who love each other without either\nunderstanding the other very well or feeling the need of a\nsympathetic understanding.  There was a strong resemblance\nbetween Burlingham and old Tom.  Both belonged to the familiar\nphilosopher type.  But, unlike the actor-manager, the old\ncabinetmaker had lived his philosophy, and a very gentle and\ntolerant philosophy it was.\n\nAfter she had looked her request for light upon what way she was\nto take, they sat silent, neither looking at the other, yet each\nseeing the other with the eye of the mind.  She said:\n\n\"I may not dare take it.\"\n\n\"You won't have no choice,\" replied he.  \"You'll have to take it.\nAnd you'll get away from here.  And you mustn't ever come\nback--or look back.  Forget all this misery.  Rememberin' won't do\nus no good.  It'd only weaken you.\"\n\n\"I shan't ever forget,\" cried the girl.\n\n\"You must,\" said the old man firmly.  He added, \"And you will.\nYou'll have too much else to think about--too much that has to\nbe attended to.\"\n\nAs the first of the year approached and the small shopkeepers of\nthe tenements, like the big ones elsewhere, were casting up the\nyear's balances and learning how far toward or beyond the verge\nof ruin the hard times had brought them, the sound of the fire\nengines--and of the ambulances--became a familiar part of the\ndaily and nightly noises of the district.  Desperate shopkeepers,\ncareless of their neighbors' lives and property in fiercely\nstriving for themselves and their families--workingmen out of a\njob and deep in debt--landlords with too heavy interest falling\ndue--all these were trying to save themselves or to lengthen the\ntime the fact of ruin could be kept secret by setting fire to\ntheir shops or their flats.  The Brashears had been burned out\ntwice in their wandering tenement house life; so old Tom was\nsleeping little; was constantly prowling about the halls of all\nthe tenements in that row and into the cellars.\n\nHe told Susan the open secret of the meaning of most of these\nfires.  And after he had cursed the fire fiends, he apologized\nfor them.  \"It's the curse of the system,\" explained he.  \"It's\nall the curse of the system.  These here storekeepers and the\nfarmers the same way--they think they're independent, but really\nthey're nothin' but fooled slaves of the big blood suckers for\nthe upper class.  But these here little storekeepers, they're\ntryin' to escape.  How does a man escape?  Why, by gettin' some\nhands together to work for him so that he can take it out of their\nwages.  When you get together enough to hire help--that's when you\npass out of slavery into the master class--master of slaves.\"\n\nSusan nodded understandingly.\n\n\"Now, how can these little storekeepers like me get together\nenough to begin to hire slaves?  By a hundred tricks, every one\nof them wicked and mean.  By skimpin' and slavin' themselves and\ntheir families, by sellin' short weight, by sellin' rotten food,\nby sellin' poison, by burnin' to get the insurance.  And, at\nlast, if they don't die or get caught and jailed, they get\ntogether the money to branch out and hire help, and begin to get\nprosperous out of the blood of their help.  These here arson\nfellows--they're on the first rung of the ladder of success.  You\nheard about that beautiful ladder in Sunday school, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan, \"that and a great many other lies about God\nand man.\"\n\nSusan had all along had great difficulty in getting sleep\nbecause of the incessant and discordant noises of the district.\nThe unhappy people added to their own misery by disturbing each\nother's rest--and no small part of the bad health everywhere\nprevailing was due to this inability of anybody to get proper\nsleep because somebody was always singing or quarreling,\nshouting or stamping about.  But Susan, being young and as yet\nuntroubled by the indigestion that openly or secretly preyed\nupon everyone else, did at last grow somewhat used to noise, did\ncontrive to get five or six hours of broken sleep.  With the\nepidemic of fires she was once more restless and wakeful.  Every\nday came news of fire somewhere in the tenement districts of the\ncity, with one or more, perhaps a dozen, roasted to death, or\nhorribly burned.  A few weeks, however, and even that peril\nbecame so familiar that she slept like the rest.  There were too\nmany actualities of discomfort, of misery, to harass her all day\nlong every time her mind wandered from her work.\n\nOne night she was awakened by a scream.  She leaped from bed to\nfind the room filling with smoke and the street bright as day,\nbut with a flickering evil light.  Etta was screaming, Ashbel was\nbawling and roaring like a tortured bull.  Susan, completely\ndazed by the uproar, seized Etta and dragged her into the hall.\nThere were Mr. and Mrs. Brashear, he in his nightdress of\ndrawers and undershirt, she in the short flannel petticoat and\nsacque in which she always slept.  Ashbel burst out of his room,\nkicking the door down instead of turning the knob.\n\n\"Lorny,\" cried old Tom, \"you take mother and Etta to the\nescape.\" And he rushed at his powerful, stupid son and began to\nstrike him in the face with his one good fist, shrieking, \"Shut\nup, you damn fool!  Shut up!\"\n\nDragging Etta and pushing Mrs. Brashear, Susan moved toward the\nend of the hall where the fire escape passed their windows.  All\nthe way down, the landings were littered with bedding, pots,\npans, drying clothes, fire wood, boxes, all manner of rubbish,\nthe overflow of the crowded little flats.  Over these\nobstructions and down the ladders were falling and stumbling\nmen, women, children, babies, in all degrees of nudity--for many\nof the big families that slept in one room with windows tight\nshut so that the stove heat would not escape and be wasted when\nfuel was so dear, slept stark naked.  Susan contrived to get\nEtta and the old woman to the street; not far behind them came\nTom and Ashbel, the son's face bleeding from the blows his\nfather had struck to quiet him.\n\nIt was a penetrating cold night, with an icy drizzle falling.\nThe street was filled with engines, hose, all manner of ruined\nhousehold effects, firemen shouting, the tenement people\nhuddling this way and that, barefooted, nearly or quite naked,\nsilent, stupefied.  Nobody had saved anything worth while.  The\nentire block was ablaze, was burning as if it had been saturated\nwith coal oil.\n\n\"The owner's done this,\" said old Tom.  \"I heard he was in\ntrouble.  But though he's a church member and what they call a\nphilanthropist, I hardly thought he'd stoop to hirin' this\ndone.  If anybody's caught, it'll be some fellow that don't know\nwho he did it for.\"\n\nAbout a hundred families were homeless in the street.  Half a\ndozen patrol wagons and five ambulances were taking the people\naway to shelter, women and babies first.  It was an hour--an hour\nof standing in the street, with bare feet on the ice, under the\nankle-deep slush--before old Tom and his wife got their turn to\nbe taken.  Then Susan and Etta and Ashbel, escorted by a\npoliceman, set out for the station house.  As they walked along,\nsomeone called out to the policeman:\n\n\"Anybody killed at the fire, officer?\"\n\n\"Six jumped and was smashed,\" replied the policeman.  \"I seen\nthree dead babies.  But they won't know for several days how many\nit'll total.\"\n\nAnd all her life long, whenever Susan Lenox heard the clang of\na fire engine, there arose before her the memory picture of that\nfire, in all the horror of detail.  A fire bell to her meant\nwretched families flung into the night, shrieks of mangled and\ndying, moans of babies with life oozing from their blue lips,\ncolumns of smoke ascending through icy, soaking air, and a vast\nglare of wicked light with flame demons leaping for joy in the\nmeasureless woe over which they were presiding.  As the little\nparty was passing the fire lines, Ashbel's foot slipped on a\nfreezing ooze of blood and slush, and he fell sprawling upon a\nhuman body battered and trampled until it was like an overturned\nbasket of butcher's odds and ends.\n\nThe station house was eleven long squares away.  But before they\nstarted for it they were already at the lowest depth of physical\nwretchedness which human nerves can register; thus, they\narrived simply a little more numb.  The big room, heated by a\nhuge, red-hot stove to the point where the sweat starts, was\ncrowded with abject and pitiful human specimens.  Even Susan, the\nmost sensitive person there, gazed about with stolid eyes.  The\nnakedness of unsightly bodies, gross with fat or wasted to\nemaciation, the dirtiness of limbs and torsos long, long\nunwashed, the foul steam from it all and from the water-soaked\nrags, the groans of some, the silent, staring misery of others,\nand, most horrible of all, the laughter of those who yielded\nlike animals to the momentary sense of physical well-being as\nthe heat thawed them out--these sights and sounds together made\nup a truly infernal picture.  And, like all the tragedies of\nabject poverty, it was wholly devoid of that dignity which is\nnecessary to excite the deep pity of respect, was sordid and\nsqualid, moved the sensitive to turn away in loathing rather\nthan to advance with brotherly sympathy and love.\n\nAshbel, his animal instinct roused by the sight of the stove,\nthrust the throng aside rudely as he pushed straight for the\nradiating center.  Etta and Susan followed in his wake.  The\nfierce heat soon roused them to the sense of their plight.\nAshbel began to curse, Etta to weep.  Susan's mind was staring,\nwithout hope but also without despair, at the walls of the trap\nin which they were all caught--was seeking the spot where they\ncould begin to burrow through and escape.\n\nBeds and covers were gathered in by the police from everywhere\nin that district, were ranged upon the floor of the four rooms.\nThe men were put in the cells downstairs; the women and the\nchildren got the cots.  Susan and Etta lay upon the same\nmattress, a horse blanket over them.  Etta slept; Susan, wide\nawake, lived in brain and nerves the heart-breaking scenes\nthrough which she had passed numb and stolid.\n\nAbout six o'clock a breakfast of coffee, milk and bread was\nserved.  It was evident that the police did not know what to do\nwith these outcasts who had nothing and no place to go--for\npractically all were out of work when the blow came.  Ashbel\ndemanded shoes, pants and a coat.\n\n\"I've got to get to my job,\" shouted he, \"or else I'll lose it.\nThen where in the hell'd we be!\"\n\nHis blustering angered the sergeant, who finally told him if he\ndid not quiet down he would be locked in a cell.  Susan\ninterrupted, explained the situation, got Ashbel the necessary\nclothes and freed Etta and herself of his worse than useless\npresence.  At Susan's suggestion such other men as had jobs were\nalso fitted out after a fashion and sent away.  \"You can take the\naddresses of their families if you send them anywhere during the\nday, and these men can come back here and find out where they've\ngone----\" this was the plan she proposed to the captain, and he\nadopted it.  As soon as the morning papers were about the city,\naid of every kind began to pour in, with the result that before\nnoon many of the families were better established than they had\nbeen before the fire.\n\nSusan and Etta got some clothing, enough to keep them warm on\ntheir way through the streets to the hospital to which Brashear\nand his wife had been taken.  Mrs. Brashear had died in the\nambulance--of heart disease, the doctors said, but Susan felt it\nwas really of the sense that to go on living was impossible.  And\nfond of her though she was, she could not but be relieved that\nthere was one less factor in the unsolvable problem.\n\n\"She's better, off\" she said to Etta in the effort to console.\n\nBut Etta needed no consolation.  \"Ever so much better off,\" she\npromptly assented.  \"Mother hasn't cared about living since we\nhad to give up our little home and become tenement house people.\nAnd she was right.\"\n\nAs to Brashear, they learned that he was ill; but they did not\nlearn until evening that he was dying of pneumonia.  The two\ngirls and Ashbel were admitted to the ward where he lay--one of\na long line of sufferers in bare, clean little beds.  Screens\nwere drawn round his bed because he was dying.  He had been\nsuffering torments from the savage assaults of the pneumonia;\nbut the pain had passed away now, so he said, though the\ndreadful sound of his breathing made Susan's heart flutter and\nher whole body quiver.\n\n\"Do you want a preacher or a priest?\" asked the nurse.\n\n\"Neither,\" replied the old man in gasps and whispers.  \"If there\nis a God he'll never let anybody from this hell of a world into\nhis presence.  They might tell him the truth about himself.\"\n\n\"Oh, father, father!\" pleaded Etta, and Ashbel burst into a fit\nof hysterical and terrified crying.\n\nThe old man turned his dying eyes on Susan.  He rested a few\nminutes, fixing her gaze upon his with a hypnotic stare.  Then he\nbegan again:\n\n\"You've got somethin' more'n a turnip on your shoulders.  Listen\nto me.  There was a man named Jesus once\"--gasp--gasp--\"You've\nheard about him, but you don't know about\nhim\"--gasp--gasp--\"I'll tell you--listen.  He was a low fellow--a\nworkin' man--same trade as mine--born without a father--born in\na horse trough--in a stable\"--gasp--gasp--\n\nSusan leaned forward.  \"Born without a father,\" she murmured, her\neyes suddenly bright.\n\n\"That's him.  Listen\"--gasp--gasp--gasp--\"He was a big\nfeller--big brain--big heart--the biggest man that ever\nlived\"--gasp--gasp--gasp--gas--\"And he looked at this here hell\nof a world from the outside, he being an outcast and a low-down\ncommon workingman.  And he _saw_--he did----\n\n\"Yes, he saw!\"--gasp--gasp--gasp--\"And he said all men were\nbrothers--and that they'd find it out some day.  He saw that this\nworld was put together for the strong and the cruel--that they\ncould win out--and make the rest of us work for 'em for what they\nchose to give--like they work a poor ignorant horse for his feed\nand stall in a dirty stable----\"gasp--gasp--gasp--\n\n\"For the strong and the cruel,\" said Susan.\n\n\"And this feller Jesus--he set round the saloons and such\nplaces--publicans, they called 'em\"--gasp--gasp--gasp--\"And he\nsays to all the poor ignorant slaves and such cattle, he says,\n'You're all brothers.  Love one another'\"--gasp--gasp--gasp--\"\n'Love one another,' he says, 'and learn to help each other and\nstand up for each other,' he says, 'and hate war and fightin'\nand money grabbin'----'\"gasp--gasp--gasp--\"'Peace on earth,' he\nsays, 'Know the truth, and the truth shall make you free'--and\nhe saw there'd be a time\"--the old man raised himself on one\nelbow--\"Yes, by God--there _will_ be!--a time when men'll learn\nnot to be beasts and'll be men--_men_, little gal!\"\n\n\"Men,\" echoed Susan, her eyes shining, her bosom heaving.\n\n\"It ain't sense and it ain't right that everything should be for\nthe few--for them with brains--and that the rest--the\nmillions--should be tramped down just because they ain't so\ncruel or so 'cute'--they and their children tramped down in the\ndirt.  And that feller Jesus saw it.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes,\" cried Susan.  \"He saw it.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what he was,\" said old Tom in a hoarse whisper.\n\"He wasn't no god.  He was bigger'n that--bigger'n that, little\ngal!  He was the first _man_ that ever lived.  He said, 'Give the\nweak a chance so as they kin git strong.' He says----\"\n\nThe dying man fell back exhausted.  His eyes rolled wildly,\nclosed; his mouth twitched, fell wide open; there came from his\nthroat a sound Susan had never heard before, but she knew what\nit was, what it meant.\n\nEtta and Ashbel were overwhelmed afresh by the disgrace of\nhaving their parents buried in Potter's Field--for the insurance\nmoney went for debts.  They did not understand when Susan said,\n\"I think your father'd have liked to feel that he was going to\nbe buried there--because then he'll be with--with his Friend.\nYou know, _He_ was buried in Potter's Field.\" However, their\ngrief was shortlived; there is no time in the lives of working\npeople for such luxuries as grief--no more time than there is at\nsea when all are toiling to keep afloat the storm-racked sinking\nship and one sailor is swept overboard.  In comfortable lives a\nbereavement is a contrast; in the lives of the wretched it is\nbut one more in the assailing army of woes.\n\nEtta took a job at the box factory at three dollars a week; she\nand Susan and Ashbel moved into two small rooms in a flat in a\ntenement opposite the factory--a cheaper and therefore lower\nhouse than the one that had burned.  They bought on the\ninstallment plan nine dollars' worth of furniture--the scant\nminimum of necessities.  They calculated that, by careful saving,\nthey could pay off the debt in a year or so--unless one or the\nother fell ill or lost work.  \"That means,\" said Etta, eyeing\ntheir flimsy and all but downright worthless purchases, \"that\nmeans we'll still be paying when this furniture'll be gone to\npieces and fit only for kindling.\"\n\n\"It's the best we can do,\" replied Susan.  \"Maybe one of us'll\nget a better job.\"\n\n\"_You_ could, I'm sure, if you had the clothes,\" said Etta.  \"But\nnot in those rags.\"\n\n\"If I had the clothes?  Where?\"\n\n\"At Shillito's or one of the other department stores.  They'd\ngive us both places in one of the men's departments.  They like\npretty girls for those places--if they're not giddy and don't\nwaste time flirting but use flirtation to sell goods.  But what's\nthe sense in talking about it?  You haven't got the clothes.  A\nsaleslady's got to be counter-dressed.  She can look as bad as\nshe pleases round the skirt and the feet.  But from the waist up\nshe has to look natty, if she wants wages.\"\n\nSusan had seen these girls; she understood now why they looked\nas if they were the put together upper and lower halves of two\ndifferent persons.  She recalled that, even though they went into\nother business, they still retained the habit, wore toilets that\nwere counterbuilt.  She revolved the problem of getting one of\nthese toilets and of securing a store job.  But she soon saw it\nwas hopeless, for the time.  Every cent the three had was needed\nto keep from starving and freezing.  Also--though she did not\nrealize it--her young enthusiasm was steadily being sapped by\nthe life she was leading.  It may have been this rather than\nnatural gentleness--or perhaps it was as much the one as the\nother--that kept Susan from taking Matson's advice and hardening\nherself into a forelady.  The ruddy glow under her skin had given\nplace to, the roundness of her form had gone, and its pallor;\nbeauty remained only because she had a figure which not even\nemaciation could have deprived of lines of alluring grace.  But\nshe was no longer quite so straight, and her hair, which it was\na sheer impossibility to care for, was losing its soft vitality.\nShe was still pretty, but not the beauty she had been when she\nwas ejected from the class in which she was bred.  However, she\ngave the change in herself little thought; it was the rapid\ndecline of Etta's prettiness and freshness that worried her most.\n\nNot many weeks after the fire and the deeper plunge, she began\nto be annoyed by Ashbel.  In his clumsy, clownish way he was\nmaking advances to her.  Several times he tried to kiss her.\nOnce, when Etta was out, he opened the door of the room where\nshe was taking a bath in a washtub she had borrowed of the\njanitress, leered in at her and very reluctantly obeyed her\nsharp order to close the door.  She had long known that he was in\nreality very different from the silent restrained person fear\nof his father made him seem to be.  But she thought even the\nreality was far above the rest of the young men growing up among\nthose degrading influences.\n\nThe intrusion into her room was on a Sunday; on the following\nSunday he came back as soon as Etta went out.  \"Look here,\nLorny,\" said he, with blustering tone and gesture, \"I want to\nhave a plain talk with you.  I'm sick and tired of this.  There's\ngot to be a change.\"\n\n\"Sick of what?\" asked Susan.\n\n\"Of the way you stand me off.\" He plumped himself sullenly down\non the edge of hers and Etta's bed.  \"I can't afford to get\nmarried.  I've got to stick by you two.\"\n\n\"It strikes me, Ashbel, we all need each other.  Who'd marry you\non seven a week?\" She laughed good-humoredly.  \"Anyhow, _you_\nwouldn't support a wife.  It takes the hardest kind of work to\nget your share of the expenses out of you.  You always try to\nbeat us down to letting you off with two fifty a week.\"\n\n\"That's about all Etta pays.\"\n\n\"It's about all she gets.  And _I_ pay three fifty--and she and I\ndo all the work--and give you two meals and a lunch to take with\nyou--and you've got a room alone--and your mending done.  I guess\nyou know when you're well off.\"\n\n\"But I ain't well off,\" he cried.  \"I'm a grown-up man--and I've\ngot to have a woman.\"\n\nSusan had become used to tenement conditions.  She said,\npractically, \"Well--there's your left over four dollars a week.\"\n\n\"Huh!\" retorted he.  \"Think I'm goin' to run any risks?  I'm no\nfool.  I take care of my health.\"\n\n\"Well--don't bother me with your troubles--at least, troubles of\nthat sort.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I will!\" shouted he, in one of those sudden furies\nthat seize upon the stupid ignorant.  \"You needn't act so nifty\nwith me.  I'm as good as you are.  I'm willing to marry you.\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Susan.  \"I'm not free to marry--even if I would.\"\n\n\"Oh--you ain't?\" For an instant his curiosity, as she thus laid\na hand upon the curtain over her past, distracted his uncertain\nattention.  But her expression, reserved, cold, maddeningly\nreminding him of a class distinction of which he was as\nsensitively conscious as she was unconscious--her expression\nbrought him back with a jerk.  \"Then you'll have to live with me,\nanyhow.  I can't stand it, and I'm not goin' to.\n\nIf you want me to stay on here, and help out, you've got to\ntreat me right.  Other fellows that do as I'm doing get treated\nright.  And I've got to be, too--or I'll clear out.\" And he\nsquirmed, and waggled his head and slapped and rubbed his heavy,\npowerful legs.\n\n\"Why, Ashbel,\" said Susan, patting him on the shoulder.  \"You and\nI are like brother and sister.  You might as well talk this way\nto Etta.\"\n\nHe gave her a brazen look, uttered a laugh that was like the\nflinging out of a bucket of filth.  \"Why not?  Other fellows that\nhave to support the family and can't afford to marry gets took\ncare of.\" Susan shrank away.  But Ashbel did not notice it.  \"It\nain't a question of Etta,\" he went on.  \"There's you--and I don't\nneed to look nowhere else.\"\n\nSusan had long since lost power to be shocked by any revelation\nof the doings of people lashed out of all civilized feelings by\nthe incessant brutal whips of poverty and driven back to the\nstate of nature.  She had never happened to hear definitely of\nthis habit--even custom--of incestuous relations; now that she\nheard, she instantly accepted it as something of which she had\nreally known for some time.  At any rate, she had no sense of\nshock.  She felt no horror, no deep disgust, simply the distaste\ninto which her original sense of horror had been thinned down by\nconstant contact with poverty's conditions--just as filth no\nlonger made her shudder, so long as it did not touch her own person.\n\n\"You'd better go and chase yourself round the square a few\ntimes,\" said she, turning away and taking up some mending.\n\n\"You see, there ain't no way out of it,\" pursued he, with an\ninsinuating grin.\n\nSusan gave him a steady, straight look.  \"Don't ever speak of it\nagain,\" said she quietly.  \"You ought to be ashamed--and you will\nbe when you think it over.\"\n\nHe laughed loudly.  \"I've thought it over.  I mean what I say.  If\nyou don't do the square thing by me, you drive me out.\"\n\nHe came hulking up to her, tried to catch her in his big\npowerful arms.  She put the table between him and her.  He kicked\nit aside and came on.  She saw that her move had given him a\nfalse impression--a notion that she was afraid of him, was\ncoquetting with him.  She opened the door leading into the front\npart of the flat where the Quinlan family lived.  \"If you don't\nbehave yourself, I'll call Mr. Quinlan,\" said she, not the least\nbluster or fear or nervousness in her tone.\n\n\"What'd be the use?  He'd only laugh.  Why, the same thing's going\non in their family.\"\n\n\"Still, he'd lynch you if I told him what _you_ were trying to do.\"\n\nEven Ashbel saw this familiar truth of human nature.  The fact\nthat Quinlan was guilty himself, far from staying him from\nmeting out savage justice to another, would make him the more\nrelentless and eager.  \"All right,\" said he.  \"Then you want me to\ngit out?\"\n\n\"I want you to behave yourself and stay on.  Go take a walk, Ashbel.\"\n\nAnd Ashbel went.  But his expression was not reassuring; Susan\nfeared he had no intention of accepting his defeat.  However, she\nreasoned that numbskull though he was, he yet had wit enough to\nrealize how greatly to his disadvantage any change he could make\nwould be.  She did not speak of the matter to Etta, who was\ntherefore taken completely by surprise when Ashbel, after a\nsilent supper that evening, burst out with his grievance:\n\n\"I'm going to pack up,\" said he.  \"I've found a place where I'll\nbe treated right.\" He looked haughtily at Susan.  \"And the\ndaughter's a good looker, too.  She's got some weight on her.  She\nain't like a washed out string.\"\n\nEtta understood at once.  \"What a low-down thing you are!\" she\ncried.  \"Just like the rest of these filthy tenement house\nanimals.  I thought _you_ had some pride.\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up!\" bawled Ashbel.  \"You're not such a much.  What're\nwe, anyhow, to put on airs?  We're as common as dirt--yes, and\nthat sniffy lady friend of yours, too.  Where'd she come from,\nanyhow?  Some dung pile, I'll bet.\"\n\nHe went into his room, reappeared with his few belongings done\ninto a bundle.  \"So long,\" said he, stalking toward the hall door.\n\nEtta burst into tears, caught him by the arm.  \"You ain't goin',\nare you, Ashy?\" cried she.\n\n\"Bet your life.  Let me loose.\" And he shook her off.  \"I'm not\ngoin' to be saddled with two women that ain't got no gratitude.\"\n\n\"My God, Lorna!\" wailed Etta.  \"Talk to him.  Make him stay.\"\n\nSusan shook her head, went to the window and gazed into the\nsnowy dreary prospect of tenement house yards.  Ashbel, who had\nbeen hesitating through hope, vented a jeering laugh.  \"Ain't she\nthe insultin'est, airiest lady!\" sneered he.  \"Well, so long.\"\n\n\"But, Ashy, you haven't paid for last week yet,\" pleaded Etta,\nclinging to his arm.\n\n\"You kin have my share of the furniture for that.\"\n\n\"The furniture!  Oh, my God!\" shrieked Etta, releasing him to\nthrow out her arms in despair.  \"How'll we pay for the furniture\nif you go?\"\n\n\"Ask your high and mighty lady friend,\" said her brother.  And he\nopened the door, passed into the hall, slammed it behind him.\nSusan waited a moment for Etta to speak, then turned to see what\nshe was doing.  She had dropped into one of the flimsy chairs,\nwas staring into vacancy.\n\n\"We'll have to give up these rooms right away,\" said Susan.\n\nEtta roused herself, looked at her friend.  And Susan saw what\nEtta had not the courage to express--that she blamed her for not\nhaving \"made the best of it\" and kept Ashbel.  And Susan was by\nno means sure that the reproach in Etta's eyes and heart were\nnot justified.  \"I couldn't do it, Etta,\" she said with a faint\nsuggestion of apology.\n\n\"Men are that way,\" said Etta sullenly.\n\n\"Oh, I don't blame him,\" protested Susan.  \"I understand.  But--I\ncan't do it, Etta--I simply can't!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Etta.  \"You couldn't.  I could, but you couldn't.  I'm\nnot as far down as Ashbel.  I'm betwixt and between; so I can\nunderstand you both.\"\n\n\"You go and make up with him and let me look after myself.  I'll\nget along.\"\n\nEtta shook her head.  \"No,\" said she without any show of\nsentiment, but like one stating an unalterable fact.  \"I've got\nto stay on with you.  I can't live without you.  I don't want to\ngo down.  I want to go up.\"\n\n\"Up!\" Susan smiled bitterly.\n\nSilence fell between them, and Susan planned for the new\nconditions.  She did not speak until Etta said, \"What ever\nwill we do?\"\n\n\"We've got to give up the furniture.  Thank goodness, we've paid\nonly two-fifty on it.\"\n\n\"Yes, _it's_ got to go,\" said Etta.\n\n\"And we've got to pay Mrs. Quinlan the six we owe her and get\nout tonight.  We'll go up to the top floor--up to Mrs. Cassatt.\nShe takes sleepers.  Then--we'll see.\"\n\nAn hour later they had moved; for Mrs. Quinlan was able to find\ntwo lodgers to take the rooms at once.  They were established\nwith Mrs. Cassatt, had a foul and foul-smelling bed and one-half\nof her back room; the other half barely contained two even\ndirtier and more malodorous cots, in one of which slept Mrs.\nCassatt's sixteen-year-old daughter Kate, in the other her\nfourteen-year-old son Dan.  For these new quarters and the right\nto cook their food on the Cassatt stove the girls agreed to pay\nthree dollars and a half a week--which left them three dollars\nand a half a week for food and clothing--and for recreation and\nfor the exercise of the virtue of thrift which the comfortable\nso assiduously urge upon the poor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nEACH girl now had with her at all times everything she possessed\nin the world--a toothbrush, a cake of castile soap, the little\nmoney left out of the week's wages, these three items in the\npocket of her one skirt, a cheap dark blue cloth much wrinkled\nand patched; a twenty-five cent felt hat, Susan's adorned with\na blue ribbon, Etta's with a bunch of faded roses; a blue cotton\nblouse patched under the arms with stuff of a different shade;\nan old misshapen corset that cost forty-nine cents in a bargain\nsale; a suit of gray shoddy-and-wool underwear; a pair of\nfifteen-cent stockings, Susan's brown, Etta's black; a pair of\nworn and torn ties, scuffed and down at the heel, bought for a\ndollar and nine cents; a dirt-stained dark blue jacket, Susan's\nlacking one button, Etta's lacking three and having a patch\nunder the right arm.\n\nYet they often laughed and joked with each other, with their\nfellow-workers.  You might have said their hearts were light; for\nso eager are we to believe our fellow-beings comfortable, a\nsmile of poverty's face convinces us straightway that it is as\nhappy as we, if not happier.  There would have been to their\nmirth a little more than mere surface and youthful ability to\nfind some jest in the most crushing tragedy if only they could\nhave kept themselves clean.  The lack of sufficient food was a\nsevere trial, for both had voracious appetites; Etta was\ntormented by visions of quantity, Susan by visions of quality as\nwell as of quantity.  But only at meal times, or when they had to\nomit a meal entirely, were they keenly distressed by the food\nquestion.  The cold was a still severer trial; but it was warm in\nthe factory and it was warm in Mrs. Cassatt's flat, whose\nwindows were never opened from closing in of winter until spring\ncame round.  The inability to keep clean was the trial of trials.\n\nFrom her beginning at the box factory the physical uncleanness\nof the other girls had made Susan suffer keenly.  And her\nsuffering can be understood only by a clean person who has been\nthrough the same ordeal.  She knew that her fellow-workers were\nnot to blame.  She even envied them the ignorance and the\ninsensibility that enabled them to bear what, she was convinced,\ncould never be changed.  She wondered sometimes at the strength\nand grip of the religious belief among the girls--even, or,\nrather, especially, among those who had strayed from virtue into\nthe path their priests and preachers and rabbis told them was\nthe most sinful of all strayings.  But she also saw many signs\nthat religion was fast losing its hold.  One day a Lutheran girl,\nEmma Schmeltz, said during a Monday morning lunch talk:\n\n\"Well, anyhow, I believe it's all a probation, and everything'll\nbe made right hereafter.  _I_ believe my religion, I do.  Yes,\nwe'll be rewarded in the hereafter.\"\n\nBecky--Rebecca Lichtenspiel--laughed, as did most of the girls.\nSaid Becky:\n\n\"And there ain't no hereafter.  Did you ever see a corpse?  Ain't\nthey the dead ones!  Don't talk to me about no hereafter.\"\n\nEverybody laughed.  But this was a Monday morning conversation,\nhigh above the average of the girls' talk in intelligence and\nliveliness.  Their minds had been stimulated by the Sunday rest\nfrom the dreary and degenerating drudgery of \"honest toil.\"\n\nIt was the physical contacts that most preyed upon Susan.  She\nwas too gentle, too considerate to show her feelings; in her\ndetermined and successful effort to conceal them she at times\nwent to the opposite extreme and not only endured but even\ncourted contacts that were little short of loathsome.  Tongue\ncould not tell what she suffered through the persistent\naffectionateness of Letty Southard, a sweet and pretty young\ngirl of wretchedly poor family who developed an enormous liking\nfor her.  Letty, dirty and clad in noisome undergarments beneath\nsoiled rags and patches, was always hugging and kissing her--and\nnot to have submitted would have been to stab poor Letty to the\nheart and humiliate all the other girls.  So no one, not even\nEtta, suspected what she was going through.\n\nFrom her coming to the factory in the morning, to hang her hat\nand jacket in the only possible place, along with the soiled and\nsmelling and often vermin-infected wraps of the others--from\nearly morning until she left at night she was forced into\ncontacts to which custom never in the least blunted her.\nHowever, so long as she had a home with the Brashears there was\nthe nightly respite.  But now--\n\nThere was little water, and only a cracked and filthy basin to\nwash in.  There was no chance to do laundry work; for their\nunderclothes must be used as night clothes also.  To wash their\nhair was impossible.\n\n\"Does my hair smell as bad as yours?\" said Etta.  \"You needn't\nthink yours is clean because it doesn't show the dirt like mine.\"\n\n\"Does my hair smell as bad as the rest of the girls'?\" said Susan.\n\n\"Not quite,\" was Etta's consoling reply.\n\nBy making desperate efforts they contrived partially to wash\ntheir bodies once a week, not without interruptions of\nprivacy--to which, however, they soon grew accustomed.  In spite\nof efforts which were literally heroic, they could not always\nkeep free from parasites; for the whole tenement and all persons\nand things in it were infected--and how could it be otherwise\nwhere no one had time or money or any effective means whatsoever\nto combat nature's inflexible determination to breed wherever\nthere is a breeding spot?  The last traces of civilization were\nslipping from the two girls; they were sinking to a state of nature.\n\nEven personal pride, powerful in Susan and strong in Etta\nthrough Susan's example, was deserting them.  They no longer\nminded Dan's sleeping in their room.  They saw him, his father,\nthe other members of the family in all stages of nudity and at\nthe most private acts; and they were seen by the Cassatts in the\nsame way.  To avoid this was impossible, as impossible as to\navoid the parasites swarming in the bed, in the woodwork, in\ncracks of ceiling, walls, floor.\n\nThe Cassatts were an example of how much the people who live in\nthe sheltered and more or less sunny nooks owe to their shelter\nand how little to their own boasted superiority of mind and\nsoul.  They had been a high class artisan family until a few\nmonths before.  The hard times struck them a series of quick,\nsavage blows, such as are commonplace enough under our social\nsystem, intricate because a crude jumble of makeshifts, and\neasily disordered because intricate.  They were swept without a\nbreathing pause down to the bottom.  Those who have always been\naccustomed to prosperity have no reserve of experience or\ncourage to enable them to recuperate from sudden and extreme\nadversity.  In an amazingly short time the Cassatts had become\ndemoralized--a familiar illustration of how civilization is\nmerely a wafer-thin veneer over most human beings as yet.  Over\nhow many is it more?  They fought after a fashion; they fought\nvaliantly.  But how would it have been possible not steadily to\nyield ground against such a pitiless, powerful foe as poverty?\nThe man had taken to drink, to blunt outraged self-respect and\nto numb his despair before the spectacle of his family's\ndownfall.  Mrs. Cassatt was as poor a manager as the average\nwoman in whatever walk of life, thanks to the habit of educating\nwoman in the most slipshod fashion, if at all, in any other part\nof the business but sex-trickery.  Thus she was helpless before\nthe tenement conditions.  She gave up, went soddenly about in\nrags with an incredibly greasy and usually dangling tail of hair.\n\n\"Why don't you tie up that tail, ma?\" said the son Dan, who had\nideas about neatness.\n\n\"What's the use?\" said Mrs. Cassatt.  \"What's the use of _anything_?\"\n\n\"Ma don't want to look stylish and stuck up,\" said the daughter.\n\nMrs. Cassatt's haunting terror was lest someone who had known\nthem in the days of their prosperity with a decently furnished\nlittle house of their own should run into one of the family now.\n\nKate, the sixteen-year-old had a place as saleslady in a big shop\nin Fifth, Street; her six dollars a week was the family's\nentire steady income.  She had formerly possessed a good\ndeal of finery for a girl in her position, though really not\nmuch more than the daughter of the average prosperous artisan or\nsmall shopkeeper expects, and is expected, to have.  Being at the\nshop where finery was all the talk and sight and thought from\nopening until closing had developed in her a greedy taste for\nluxury.  She pilfered from the stocks of goods within her reach\nand exchanged her stealings for the stealings of girls who\nhappened to be able to get things more to her liking or need.\nBut now that the family savings--bank account was exhausted, all\nthese pilferings had to go at once to the pawnshop.  Kate grew\nmore and more ill-tempered as the family sank.  Formerly she had\nbeen noted for her amiability, for her vanity easily pleased\nwith a careless compliment from no matter whom--a jocose,\nhalf-drunken ash man, half-jeering, half-admiring from his cart\nseat quite as satisfactory as anybody.  But poverty was bringing\nout in her all those meanest and most selfish and most brutish\ninstincts--those primal instincts of human nature that\ncivilization has slowly been subjecting to the process of\natrophy which has lost us such other primal attributes as, for\nexample, prehensile toes and a covering of hair.\n\n\"Well, I for one don't have to stay in this slop barrel,\" Kate\nwas always saying.  \"Some fine morning I'll turn up missing--and\nyou'll see me in my own turnout.\"\n\nShe was torturing her mother and father with the dread that she\nwould leave the family in the lurch and enter a house of\nprostitution.  She recounted with the utmost detail how the madam\nof a house in Longworth Street came from time to time to her\ncounter in the perfumery and soap department--and urged her to\n\"stop making a fool of yourself and come get good money for your\nlooks before you lose 'em drudging behind a counter.\" The idea\ngrew less abhorrent, took on allurement as the degradation of\ntenement life ate out respect for conventional restraints--for\nmodesty, for virtue, for cleanness of speech, and the rest.  More\nand more boldly Kate was announcing that she wasn't going to be\na fool much longer.\n\nDan, the fourteen-year-old boy, had attracted the attention of\nwhat Cassatt called \"a fancy lady\" who lived two floors below\nthem.  She made sometimes as much as nine or ten dollars a week\nand slept all day or lounged comfortably about in showy, tawdry\nstuff that in those surroundings seemed elegant luxury.  She was\ncaught by the boy's young beauty and strength, and was rapidly\ntraining him in every vice and was fitting him to become a\nprofessional seducer and \"lover.\"\n\nSaid Mrs. Cassatt in one of her noisy wailing appeals to Dan:\n\n\"You better keep away from that there soiled dove.  They tell me\nshe's a thief--has done time--has robbed drunken men in dark\nhallways.\"\n\nDan laughed impudently.  \"She's a cute one.  What diff does it\nmake how she gets the goods as long as she gets it?\"\n\nMrs. Cassatt confided to everybody that she was afraid the woman\nwould make a thief of her boy--and there was no disputing the\njustice of her forebodings.\n\nFoul smells and sights everywhere, and foul language; no\nprivacy, no possibility of modesty where all must do all in the\nsame room:  vermin, parasites, bad food vilely cooked--in the\nmidst of these and a multitude of similar ills how was it\npossible to maintain a human standard, even if one had by chance\nacquired a knowledge of what constituted a human standard?  The\nCassatts were sinking into the slime in which their neighbors\nwere already wallowing.  But there was this difference.  For the\nCassatts it was a descent; for many of their neighbors it was an\nascent--for the immigrants notably, who had been worse off in\ntheir European homes; in this land not yet completely in the\ngrip of the capitalist or wage system they were now getting the\nfirst notions of decency and development, the first views and\nhope of rising in the world.  The Cassatts, though they had\nalways lived too near the slime to be nauseated by it, still\nfound it disagreeable and in spots disgusting.  Their neighbors--\n\nOne of the chief reasons why these people were rising so slowly\nwhere they were rising at all was that the slime seemed to them\nnatural, and to try to get clean of it seemed rather a foolish,\nfinicky waste of time and effort.  People who have come up--by\naccident, or by their own force, or by the force of some at once\nshrewd and brutal member of the family--have to be far and long\nfrom the slums before they lose the sense that in conforming to\nthe decencies of life they are making absurd effeminate concessions.\nWhen they go to buy a toothbrush they blush and stammer.\n\n\"Look at Lorna and Etta,\" Mrs. Cassatt was always saying to Kate.\n\n\"Well, I see 'em,\" Kate would reply.  \"And I don't see much.\"\n\n\"Ain't you ashamed of yourself!\" cried the mother.  \"Them two\nlives straight and decent.  And you're better off than they are.\"\n\n\"Don't preach to me, ma,\" sneered Kate.  \"When I get ready\nI'll--stop making a damn fool of myself.\"\n\nBut the example of the two girls was not without its effect.\nThey, struggling on in chastity against appalling odds, became\nthe models, not only to Mrs. Cassatt, but all the mothers of\nthat row held up to their daughters.  The mothers--all of them by\nobservation, not a few by experience--knew what the \"fancy\nlady's\" life really meant.  And they strove mightily to keep\ntheir daughters from it.  Not through religion or moral feeling,\nthough many pretended--perhaps fancied--that this was their\nreason; but through the plainest kind of practical sense--the\nkind that in the broad determines the actions of human beings of\nwhatever class, however lofty the idealistic pretenses may be.\nThese mothers knew that the profession of the pariah meant a\nshort life and a wretched one, meant disease, lower and ever\nlower wages, the scale swiftly descending, meant all the\nmiseries of respectability plus a heavy burden of miseries of\nits own.  There were many other girls besides Susan and Etta\nholding up their heads--girls with prospects of matrimony, girls\nwith fairly good wages, girls with fathers and brothers at work\nand able to provide a home.  But Susan and Etta were peculiarly\nvaluable as examples because they were making the fight alone\nand unaided.\n\nThus, they were watched closely.  In those neighborhoods everyone\nknows everyone's else business down to how the last cent is got\nand spent.  If either girl had appeared in a new pair of shoes,\na new hat, a new garment of any kind, at once the report would\nhave sped that the wearer had taken a turn in the streets.  And\nthe scandal would have been justified; for where could either\nhave respectably got the money for the smallest and cheapest\naddition to her toilet?  Matson, too, proudly pointed them out as\ngiving the lie to the talk about working girls not getting\nliving wages, to the muttering against him and his fellow\nemployers as practically procurers for the pavement and the\ndive, for the charity hospital's most dreadful wards, for the\nMorgue's most piteous boxes and slabs.\n\nAs their strength declined, as their miseries ate in and in, the\ntwo girls ceased talking together; they used to chatter much of\nthe time like two birds on a leafy, sunny bough.  Now they\nwalked, ate their scanty, repulsive meals, dressed, worked, all\nin silence.  When their eyes met both glanced guiltily away, each\nfearing the other would discover the thought she was\nrevolving--the thought of the streets.  They slept badly--Etta\nsometimes, Susan every night.  For a long time after she came to\nthe tenements she had not slept well, despite her youth and the\ndull toil that wore her out each day.  But after many months she\nhad grown somewhat used to the noisiness--to fretting babies, to\nwailing children, the mixed ale parties, the quarrelings of the\nill and the drunk, the incessant restlessness wherever people\nare huddled so close together that repose is impossible.  And she\nhad gradually acquired the habit of sleeping well--that is, well\nfor the tenement region where no one ever gets the rest without\nwhich health is impossible.  Now sleeplessness came again--hours\non hours of listening to the hateful and maddening discords of\ndensely crowded humanity, hours on hours of\nthinking--thinking--in the hopeless circles like those of a\ncaged animal, treading with soft swift step round and round,\nnose to the iron wall, eyes gleaming with despairing pain.\nOne Saturday evening after a supper of scorched cornmeal which\nhad been none too fresh when they got it at the swindling\ngrocer's on the street floor, Etta put on the tattered, patched\nold skirt at which she had been toiling.  \"I can't make it fit to\nwear,\" said she.  \"It's too far gone; I think\"--her eyelids\nfluttered--\"I'll go see some of the girls.\"\n\nSusan, who was darning--seated on the one chair--yes, it had once\nbeen a chair--did not look up or speak.  Etta put on her\nhat--slowly.  Then, with a stealthy glance at Susan, she moved\nslidingly toward the door.  As she reached it Susan's hands\ndropped to her lap; so tense were Etta's nerves that the gesture\nmade her startle.  \"Etta!\" said Susan in an appealing voice.\n\nEtta's hand dropped from the knob.  \"Well--what is it, Lorna?\"\nshe asked in a low, nervous tone.\n\n\"Look at me, dear.\"\n\nEtta tried to obey, could not.\n\n\"Don't do it--yet,\" said Susan.  \"Wait--a few more days.\"\n\n\"Wait for what?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  But--wait.\"\n\n\"You get four, I get only three--and there's no chance of a\nraise.  I work slower instead of faster.  I'm going to be\ndischarged soon.  I'm in rags underneath. . . .  I've got to go\nbefore I get sick--and won't have anything to--to sell.\"\n\nSusan did not reply.  She stared at the remains of a cheap\nstocking in her lap.  Yes, there was no doubt about it, Etta's\nhealth was going.  Etta was strong, but she had no such store of\nstrength to draw upon as had accumulated for Susan during the\nseventeen years of simple, regular life in healthful\nsurroundings.  A little while and Etta would be ill--would,\nperhaps--probably--almost certainly--die--\n\nDan Cassatt came in at the other door, sat on the edge of his\nbed and changed his trousers for what he was pleased to imagine\na less disreputable pair.  Midway the boy stopped and eyed\nSusan's bare leg and foot, a grin of pleasure and amusement on\nhis precociously and viciously mature face.\n\n\"My, but you keep clean,\" he cried.  \"And you've got a mighty\npretty foot.  Minnie's is ugly as hell.\"\n\nMinnie was the \"fancy lady\" on the floor below--\"my skirt,\" he\ncalled her.  Susan evidently did not hear his compliment.  Dan\ncompleted his \"sporting toilet\" with a sleeking down of his long\ngreasy hair, took himself away to his girl.  Susan was watching\na bug crawl down the wall toward their bed with its stained and\nmalodorous covers of rag.  Etta was still standing by the door\nmotionless.  She sighed, once more put her hand on the knob.\n\nSusan's voice came again.  \"You've never been out, have you?\"\n\"No,\" replied Etta.\n\nSusan began to put on her stocking.  \"I'll go,\" said she.  \"I'll\ngo--instead.\"\n\n\"No!\" cried Etta, sobbing.  \"It don't matter about me.  I'm bound\nto be sucked under.  You've got a chance to pull through.\"\n\n\"Not a ghost of a chance,\" answered Susan.  \"I'll go.  You've\nnever been.\"\n\n\"I know, but----\"\n\n\"You've never been,\" continued Susan, fastening her shoe with\nits ragged string.  \"You've never been.  Well--I have.\"\n\n\"You!\" exclaimed Etta, horrified though unbelieving.  \"Oh, no,\nyou haven't.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan.  \"And worse.\"\n\n\"And worse?\" repeated Etta.  \"Is that what the look I sometimes\nsee in your eyes--when you don't know anyone's seeing--is that\nwhat it means?\"\n\n\"I suppose so.  I'll go.  You stay here.\"\n\n\"And you--out there!\"\n\n\"It doesn't mean much to me.\"\n\nEtta looked at her with eyes as devoted as a dog's.  \"Then we'll\ngo together,\" she said.\n\nSusan, pinning on her weather-stained hat, reflected.  \"Very\nwell,\" she said finally.  \"There's nothing lower than this.\"\n\nThey said no more; they went out into the clear, cold winter\nnight, out under the brilliant stars.  Several handsome theater\nbuses were passing on their way from the fashionable suburb to\nthe theater.  Etta looked at them, at the splendid horses, at the\nmen in top hats and fur coats--clean looking, fine looking,\namiable looking men--at the beautiful fur wraps of the delicate\nwomen--what complexions!--what lovely hair!--what jewels!  Etta,\nher heart bursting, her throat choking, glanced at Susan to see\nwhether she too was observing.  But Susan's eyes were on the\ntenement they had just left.\n\n\"What are you looking at--so queer?\" asked Etta.\n\n\"I was thinking that we'll not come back here.\"\n\nEtta started.  \"Not come back _home!_\"\n\nSusan gave a strange short laugh.  \"Home!. . .  No, we'll not\ncome back home.  There's no use doing things halfway.  We've made\nthe plunge.  We'll go--the limit.\"\n\nEtta shivered.  She admired the courage, but it terrified her.\n\"There's something--something--awful about you, Lorna,\" she\nsaid.  \"You've changed till you're like a different person from\nwhat you were when you came to the restaurant.  Sometimes--that\nlook in your eyes--well, it takes my breath away.\"\n\n\"It takes _my_ breath away, too.  Come on.\"\n\nAt the foot of the hill they took the shortest route for Vine\nStreet, the highway of the city's night life.\n\nThough they were so young and walked briskly, their impoverished\nblood was not vigorous enough to produce a reaction against the\nsharp wind of the zero night which nosed through their few thin\ngarments and bit into their bodies as if they were naked.  They\ncame to a vast department store.  Each of its great show-windows,\nflooded with light, was a fascinating display of clothing for\nwomen upon wax models--costly jackets and cloaks of wonderful\nfurs, white, brown, gray, rich and glossy black; underclothes\nfine and soft, with ribbons and flounces and laces; silk\nstockings and graceful shoes and slippers; dresses for street,\nfor ball, for afternoon, dresses with form, with lines, dresses\nelegantly plain, dresses richly embroidered.  Despite the cold\nthe two girls lingered, going from window to window, their\nfreezing faces pinched and purple, their eyes gazing hungrily.\n\n\"Now that we've tried 'em all on,\" said Susan with a short and\nbitter laugh, \"let's dress in our dirty rags again and go.\"\n\n\"Oh, I couldn't imagine myself in any of those things--could\nyou?\" cried Etta.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Susan.  \"And better.\"\n\n\"You were brought up to have those things, I know.\"\n\nSusan shook her head.  \"But I'm going to have them.\"\n\n\"When?\" said Etta, scenting romance.  \"Soon?\"\n\n\"As soon as I learn,\" was Susan's absent, unsatisfactory reply.\n\nEtta had gone back to her own misery and the contrasts to it.  \"I\nget mad through and through,\" she cried, \"when I think how all\nthose things go to some women--women that never did work and\nnever could.  And they get them because they happen to belong to\nrich fathers and husbands or whoever protects them.  It isn't\nfair!  It makes me crazy!\"\n\nSusan gave a disdainful shrug.  \"What's the use of that kind of\ntalk!\" said she.  \"No use at all.  The thing is, _we_ haven't got\nwhat we want, and we've got to _get_ it--and so we've got to\n_learn_ how.\"\n\n\"I can't think of anything but the cold,\" said Etta.  \"My God,\nhow cold I am!  There isn't anything I wouldn't do to get warm.\nThere isn't anything anybody wouldn't do to get warm, if they\nwere as cold as this.  It's all very well for warm people to\ntalk----\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sick of all the lying and faking, anyhow.  Do you\nbelieve in hell, Lorna?\"\n\n\"Not in a hot one,\" said Susan.\n\nSoon they struck into Vine Street, bright as day almost, and\nlined with beer halls, concert gardens, restaurants.  Through the\nglass fronts crowds of men and women were visible--contented\nfaces, well-fed bodies, food on the tables or inviting-looking\ndrink.  Along the sidewalk poured an eager throng, all the\nconspicuous faces in it notable for the expectancy of pleasure\nin the eyes.\n\n\"Isn't this different!\" exclaimed Etta.  \"My God, how cold I\nam--and how warm everybody else is but us!\"\n\nThe sights, the sounds of laughter, of gay music, acted upon her\nlike an intoxicant.  She tossed her head in a reckless gesture.\n\"I don't care what becomes of me,\" said she.  \"I'm ready for\nanything except dirt and starvation.\"\n\nNevertheless, they hurried down Vine Street, avoiding the\nglances of the men and behaving as if they were two working\ngirls in a rush to get home.  As they walked, Susan, to delude\nherself into believing that she was not hesitating, with\nfainting courage talked incessantly to Etta--told her the things\nMabel Connemora had explained to her--about how a woman could,\nand must, take care of her health, if she were not to be swept\nunder like the great mass of the ignorant, careless women of the\npariah class.  Susan was astonished that she remembered all the\nactress had told her--remembered it easily, as if she had often\nthought of it, had used the knowledge habitually.\n\nThey arrived at Fountain Square, tired from the long walk.  They\nwere both relieved and depressed that nothing had happened.  \"We\nmight go round the fountain and then back,\" suggested Susan.\n\nThey made the tour less rapidly but still keeping their heads\nand their glances timidly down.  They were numb with the cold\nnow.  To the sharp agony had succeeded an ache like the steady\ngrinding pain of rheumatism.  Etta broke the silence with, \"Maybe\nwe ought to go into a house.\"\n\n\"A house!  Oh--you mean a--a sporting house.\" At that time\nprofessional prostitution had not become widespread among the\nworking class; stationary or falling wages, advancing cost of\nfood and developing demand for comfort and luxury had as yet\nonly begun to produce their inevitable results.  Thus,\nprostitution as an industry was in the main segregated in\ncertain streets and certain houses and the prostitutes were a\ndistinct class.\n\n\"You haven't been?\" inquired Etta.\n\n\"No,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Dan Cassatt and Kate told me about those places,\" Etta went on.\n\"Kate says they're fine and the girls make fifty and sometimes\na hundred dollars a week, and have everything--servants to wait\non them, good food, bathrooms, lovely clothes, and can drive\nout.  But I--I think I'd stay in the house.\"\n\n\"I want to be my own boss,\" said Susan.\n\n\"There's another side than what Kate says,\" continued Etta as\nconsecutively as her chattering teeth would permit.  \"She heard\nfrom a madam that wants her to come.  But Dan heard from\nMinnie--she used to be in one--and she says the girls are\nslaves, that they're treated like dogs and have to take\nanything.  She says it's something dreadful the way men act--even\nthe gentlemen.  She says the madam fixes things so that every\ngirl always owes her money and don't own a stitch to her back,\nand so couldn't leave if she wanted to.\"\n\n\"That sounds more like the truth,\" said Susan.\n\n\"But we may _have_ to go,\" pleaded Etta.  \"It's awful cold--and if\nwe went, at least we'd have a warm place.  If we wanted to leave,\nwhy, we couldn't be any worse off for clothes than we are.\"\n\nSusan had no answer for this argument.  They went several squares\nup Vine Street in silence.  Then Etta burst out again:\n\n\"I'm frozen through and through, Lorna, and I'm dead tired--and\nhungry.  The wind's cutting the flesh off my bones.  What in the\nhell does it matter what becomes of us?  Let's get warm, for\nGod's sake.  Let's go to a house.  They're in Longworth\nStreet--the best ones.\"\n\nAnd she came to a halt, forcing Susan to halt also.  It happened\nto be the corner of Eighth Street.  Susan saw the iron fence, the\nleafless trees of Garfield Place.  \"Let's go down this way,\" said\nshe.  \"I had luck here once.\"\n\n\"Luck!\" said Etta, her curiosity triumphant over all.\n\nSusan's answer was a strange laugh.  Ahead of them, a woman\nwarmly and showily dressed was sauntering along.  \"That's one of\nthem,\" said Etta.  \"Let's see how _she_ does it.  We've got to\nlearn quick.  I can't stand this cold much longer.\"\n\nThe two girls, their rags fluttering about their miserable\nbodies, kept a few feet behind the woman, watched her with\nhollow eyes of envy and fear.  Tears of anguish from the cold\nwere streaming down their cheeks.  Soon a man alone--a youngish\nman with a lurching step--came along.  They heard the woman say,\n\"Hello, dear.  Don't be in a hurry.\"\n\nHe tried to lurch past her, but she seized him by the lapel of\nhis overcoat.  \"Lemme go,\" said he.  \"You're old enough to be a\ngrandmother, you old hag.\"\n\nSusan and Etta halted and, watching so interestedly that they\nforgot themselves, heard her laugh at his insult, heard her say\nwheedlingly, \"Come along, dearie, I'll treat you right.  You're\nthe kind of a lively, joky fellow I like.\"\n\n\"Go to hell, gran'ma,\" said the man, roughly shaking her off and\nlurching on toward the two girls.  He stopped before them, eyed\nthem by the light of the big electric lamp, grinned\ngood-naturedly.  \"What've we got here?\" said he.  \"This looks better.\"\n\nThe woman rushed toward the girls, pouring out a stream of\nvileness.  \"You git out of here!\" she shrilled.  \"You chippies git\noff my beat.  I'll have you pinched--I will!\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" cried the drunken man, lifting his fist.  \"I'll have\n_you_ pinched.  Let these ladies alone, they're friends of mine.\nDo you want me to call the cop?\"\n\nThe woman glanced toward the corner where a policeman was\nstanding, twirling his club.  She turned away, cursing horribly.\nThe man laughed.  \"Dirty old hag--isn't she?\" said he.  \"Don't\nlook so scared, birdies.\" He caught them each by an arm, stared\nwoozily at Etta.  \"You're a good little looker, you are.  Come\nalong with me.  There's three in it.\"\n\n\"I--I can't leave my lady friend,\" Etta succeeded in chattering.\n\"Please really I can't.\"\n\n\"Your lady friend?\" He turned his drunken head in Susan's\ndirection, squinted at her.  He was rather good-looking.  \"Oh--she\nmeans _you_.  Fact is, I'm so soused I thought I was seein'\ndouble.  Why, _you're_ a peach.  I'll take you.\" And he released his\nhold on Etta to seize her.  \"Come right along, my lovey-dovey dear.\"\n\nSusan drew away; she was looking at him with terror and\nrepulsion.  The icy blast swept down the street, sawed into her\nflesh savagely.\n\n\"I'll give _you_ five,\" said the drunken man.  \"Come along.\" He\ngrabbed her arm, waved his other hand at Etta.  \"So long,\nblondie.  'Nother time.  Good luck.\"\n\nSusan heard Etta's gasp of horror.  She wrenched herself free\nagain.  \"I guess I'd better go with him,\" said she to Etta.\n\nEtta began to sob.  \"Oh, Lorna!\" she moaned.  \"It's awful.\"\n\n\"You go into the restaurant on the corner and get something to\neat, and wait for me.  We can afford to spend the money.  And\nyou'll be warm there.\"\n\n\"Here!  Here!\" cried the tipsy man.  \"What're you two whispering\nabout?  Come along, skinny.  No offense.  I like 'em slim.\" And he\nmade coarse and pointed remarks about the sluggishness of fat\nwomen, laughing loudly at his own wit.\n\nThe two girls did not hear.  The wind straight from the Arctic\nwas plying its hideous lash upon their defenseless bodies.\n\n\"Come on, lovey!\" cried the man.  \"Let's go in out of the cold.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lorna!  You can't go with a drunken man!  I'll--I'll take\nhim.  I can stand it better'n you.  You can go when there's a\ngentleman----\"\n\n\"You don't know,\" said Susan.  \"Didn't I tell you I'd been\nthrough the worst?\"\n\n\"Are you coming?\" broke in the man, shaking his head to scatter\nthe clouds over his sight.\n\nThe cold was lashing Susan's body; and she was seeing the\ntenement she had left--the vermin crawling, the filth\neverywhere, the meal bugs in the rotting corn meal--and Jeb\nFerguson.  \"Wait in the restaurant,\" said she to Etta.  \"Didn't I\ntell you I'm a nobody.  This is what's expected of me.\" The wind\nclawed and tore at her quivering flesh.  \"It's cold, Etta.  Go get\nwarm.  Good-by.\"\n\nShe yielded to the tipsy man's tugging at her arm.  Etta stood as\nif paralyzed, watching the two move slowly westward.  But cold\nsoon triumphed over horror.  She retraced her steps toward Vine\nStreet.  At the corner stood an elderly man with an iron-gray\nbeard.  She merely glanced at him in passing, and so was startled\nwhen he said in a low voice:\n\n\"Go back the way you came.  I'll join you.\" She glanced at him\nagain, saw a gleam in his eyes that assured her she had not\nimagined the request.  Trembling and all at once hot, she kept on\nacross the street.  But instead of going into the restaurant she\nwalked past it and east through dark Eighth Street.  A few yards,\nand she heard a quiet step behind her.  A few yards more, and the\nlights of Vine Street threw a man's shadow upon the sidewalk\nbeside her.  From sheer fright she halted.  The man faced her--a\nman old enough to be her father, a most respectable, clean\nlooking man with a certain churchly though hardly clerical air\nabout him.  \"Good evening, miss,\" said he.\n\n\"Good evening,\" she faltered.\n\n\"I'm a stranger--in town to buy goods and have a little fun,\"\nstammered he with a grotesque attempt to be easy and familiar.\n\"I thought maybe you could help me.\"\n\nA little fun!  Etta's lips opened, but no words came.  The cold\nwas digging its needle-knives into flesh, into bone, into nerve.\nThrough the man's thick beard and mustache came the gleam of\nlarge teeth, the twisting of thick raw lips.  A little fun!\n\n\"Would it,\" continued the man, nervously, \"would it be very dear?\"\n\n\"I--I don't know,\" faltered Etta.\n\n\"I could afford--say--\" he looked at her dress--\"say--two dollars.\"\n\n\"I--I\" And again Etta could get no further.\n\n\"The room'd be a dollar,\" pleaded the man.  \"That'd make it three.\"\n\n\"I--I--can't,\" burst out Etta, hysterical.  \"Oh, please let me\nalone.  I--I'm a good girl, but I do need money.  But I--I can't.\nOh, for God's sake--I'm so cold--so cold!\"\n\nThe man was much embarrassed.  \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" he said\nfeelingly.  \"That's right--keep your virtue.  Go home to your\nparents.\" He was at ease now; his voice was greasy and his words\nsleek with the unction of an elder.  \"I thought you were a soiled\ndove.  I'm glad you spoke out--glad for my sake as well as your\nown.  I've got a daughter about your age.  Go home, my dear, and\nstay a good girl.  I know it's hard sometimes; but never give up\nyour purity--never!\" And he lifted his square-topped hard hat\nand turned away.\n\nSuddenly Etta felt again the fury of the winter night and icy\nwind.  As that wind flapped her thin skirt and tortured her\nflesh, she cried, \"Wait--please.  I was just--just fooling.\"\n\nThe man had halted, but he was looking at her uncertainly.  Etta\nput her hand on his arm and smiled pertly up at him--smiled as\nshe had seen other street girls smile in the days when she\ndespised them.  \"I'll go--if you'll give me three.\"\n\n\"I--I don't think I care to go now.  You sort of put me out of\nthe humor.\"\n\n\"Well--two, then.\" She gave a reckless laugh.  \"God, how cold it\nis!  Anybody'd go to hell to get warm a night like this.\"\n\n\"You are a very pretty girl,\" said the man.  He was warmly\ndressed; his was not the thin blood of poverty.  He could not\nhave appreciated what she was feeling.  \"You're sure you want to\ngo?  You're sure it's your--your business?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I'm strange in this part of town.  Do you know a place?\"\n\nAn hour later Etta went into the appointed restaurant.  Her eyes\nsearched anxiously for Susan, but did not find her.  She inquired\nat the counter.  No one had asked there for a young lady.  This\nboth relieved her and increased her nervousness; Susan had not\ncome and gone--but would she come?  Etta was so hungry that she\ncould hold out no longer.  She sat at a table near the door and\ntook up the large sheet on which was printed the bill of fare.\nShe was almost alone in the place, as it was between dinner and\nsupper.  She read the bill thoroughly, then ordered black bean\nsoup, a sirloin steak and German fried potatoes.  This, she had\ncalculated, would cost altogether a dollar; undoubtedly an\nextravagance, but everything at that restaurant seemed dear in\ncomparison with the prices to which she had been used, and she\nfelt horribly empty.  She ordered the soup, to stay her while the\nsteak was broiling.\n\nAs soon as the waiter set down bread and butter she began upon\nit greedily.  As the soup came, in walked Susan--calm and\nself-possessed, Etta saw at first glance.  \"I've been so\nfrightened.  You'll have a plate of soup?\" asked Etta, trying to\nlook and speak in unconcerned fashion.\n\n\"No, thank you,\" replied Susan, seating herself opposite.\n\n\"There's a steak coming--a good-sized one, the waiter said it'd be.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nSusan spoke indifferently.\n\n\"Aren't you hungry?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  I'll see.\" Susan was gazing straight ahead.  Her\neyes were distinctly gray--gray and as hard as Susan Lenox's\neyes could be.\n\n\"What're you thinking about?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she laughed queerly.\n\n\"Was--it--dreadful?\"\n\nA pause, then:  \"Nothing is going to be dreadful to me any more.\nIt's all in the game, as Mr. Burlingham used to say.\"\n\n\"Burlingham--who's he?\" It was Etta's first faint clew toward\nthat mysterious past of Susan's into which she longed to peer.\n\n\"Oh--a man I knew.  He's dead.\"\n\nA long pause, Etta watching Susan's unreadable face.  At last she said:\n\n\"You don't seem a bit excited.\"\n\nSusan came back to the present.  \"Don't I?  Your soup's getting cold.\"\n\nEtta ate several spoonfuls, then said with an embarrassed\nattempt at a laugh, \"I--I went, too.\"\n\nSusan slowly turned upon Etta her gaze--the gaze of eyes\nsoftening, becoming violet.  Etta's eyes dropped and the color\nflooded into her fair skin.  \"He was an old man--forty or maybe\nfifty,\" she explained nervously.  \"He gave me two dollars.  I\nnearly didn't get him.  I lost my nerve and told him I was good\nand was only starting because I needed money.\"\n\n\"Never whine,\" said Susan.  \"It's no use.  Take what comes, and\nwait for a winning hand.\"\n\nEtta looked at her in a puzzled way.  \"How queer you talk!  Not a\nbit like yourself.  You sound so much older. . . .  And your\neyes--they don't look natural at all.\"\n\nIndeed they looked supernatural.  The last trace of gray was\ngone.  They were of the purest, deepest violet, luminous,\nmysterious, with that awe-inspiring expression of utter\naloneness.  But as Etta spoke the expression changed.  The gray\ncame back and with it a glance of irony.  Said she:\n\n\"Oh--nonsense!  I'm all right.\"\n\n\"I didn't mind nearly as much as I thought I would.  Yes, I'll\nget used to it.\"\n\n\"You mustn't,\" said Susan.\n\n\"But I've got to.\"\n\n\"We've got to do it, but we haven't got to get used to it,\"\nreplied Susan.\n\nEtta was still puzzling at this when the dinner now came--a\nfine, thick broiled steak, the best steak Susan had ever seen,\nand the best food Etta had ever seen.\n\nThey had happened upon one of those famous Cincinnati chop\nhouses where in plain surroundings the highest quality of plain\nfood is served.  \"You _are_ hungry, aren't you, Lorna?\" said Etta.\n\n\"Yes--I'm hungry,\" declared Susan.  \"Cut it--quick.\"\n\n\"Draught beer or bottled?\" asked the waiter.\n\n\"Bring us draught beer,\" said Etta.  \"I haven't tasted beer since\nour restaurant burned.\"\n\n\"I never tasted it,\" said Susan.  \"But I'll try it tonight.\"\n\nEtta cut two thick slices from the steak, put them on Susan's\nplate with some of the beautifully browned fried potatoes.\n\"Gracious, they have good things to eat here!\" she exclaimed.\nThen she cut two thick slices for herself, and filled her mouth.\nHer eyes glistened, the color came into her pale cheeks.  \"Isn't\nit _grand_!\" she cried, when there was room for words to pass out.\n\n\"Grand,\" agreed Susan, a marvelous change of expression in her\nface also.\n\nThe beer came.  Etta drank a quarter of the tall glass at once.\nSusan tasted, rather liked the fresh bitter-sweet odor and\nflavor.  \"Is it--very intoxicating?\" she inquired.\n\n\"If you drink enough,\" said Etta.  \"But not one glass.\"\n\nSusan took quite a drink.  \"I feel a lot less tired already,\"\ndeclared she.\n\n\"Me too,\" said Etta.  \"My, what a meal!  I never had anything like\nthis in my life.  When I think what we've been through!  Lorna,\nwill it _last_?\"\n\n\"We mustn't think about that,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Tell me what happened to you.\"\n\n\"Nothing.  He gave me the money, that was all.\"\n\n\"Then we've got seven dollars--seven dollars and twenty cents,\nwith what we brought away from home with us.\"\n\n\"Seven dollars--and twenty cents,\" repeated Susan thoughtfully.\nThen a queer smile played around the corners of her mouth.\n\"Seven dollars--that's a week's wages for both of us at Matson's.\"\n\n\"But I'd go back to honest work tomorrow--if I could find a good\njob,\" Etta said eagerly--too eagerly.  \"Wouldn't you, Lorna?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Susan.  She had the inability to make\npretenses, either to others or to herself, which characterizes\nstupid people and also the large, simple natures.\n\n\"Oh, you can't mean that!\" protested Etta.  Instead of replying\nSusan began to talk of what to do next.  \"We must find a place to\nsleep, and we must buy a few things to make a better appearance.\"\n\n\"I don't dare spend anything yet,\" said Etta.  \"I've got only my\ntwo dollars.  Not that when this meal's paid for.\"\n\n\"We're going to share even,\" said Susan.  \"As long as either has\nanything, it belongs to both.\"\n\nThe tears welled from Etta's eyes.  \"You are too good, Lorna!\nYou mustn't be.  It isn't the way to get on.  Anyhow, I can't\naccept anything from you.  You wouldn't take anything from me.\"\n\n\"We've got to help each other up,\" insisted Susan.  \"We share\neven--and let's not talk any more about it.  Now, what shall we\nget?  How much ought we to lay out?\"\n\nThe waiter here interrupted.  \"Beg pardon, young ladies,\" said\nhe.  \"Over yonder, at the table four down, there's a couple of\ngents that'd like to join you.  I seen one of 'em flash quite a\nroll, and they acts too like easy spenders.\"\n\nAs Susan was facing that way, she examined them.  They were young\nmen, rather blond, with smooth faces, good-natured eyes and\nmouths; they were well dressed--one, the handsomer, notably so.\nSusan merely glanced; both men at once smiled at her with an\nunimpertinent audacity that probably came out of the champagne\nbottle in a silver bucket of ice on their table.\n\n\"Shall I tell 'em to come over?\" said the waiter.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Susan.\n\nShe was calm, but Etta twitched with nervousness, saying, \"I\nwish I'd had your experience.  I wish we didn't look so\ndreadful--me especially.  _I_'m not pretty enough to stand out\nagainst these awful clothes.\"\n\nThe two men were pushing eagerly toward them, the taller and\nless handsome slightly in advance.  He said, his eyes upon Susan,\n\"We were lonesome, and you looked a little that way too.  We're much\nobliged.\" He glanced at the waiter.  \"Another bottle of the same.\"\n\n\"I don't want anything to drink,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Nor I,\" chimed in Etta.  \"No, thank you.\"\n\nThe young man waved the waiter away with, \"Get it for my friend\nand me, then.\" He smiled agreeably at Susan.  \"You won't mind my\nfriend and me drinking?\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\"\n\n\"And maybe you'll change your mind,\" said the shorter man to\nEtta.  \"You see, if we all drink, we'll get acquainted faster.\nDon't you like champagne?\"\n\n\"I never tasted it,\" Etta confessed.\n\n\"Neither did I,\" admitted Susan.\n\n\"You're sure to like it,\" said the taller man to Susan--his\nfriend presently addressed him as John.  \"Nothing equal to\nit for making friends.  I like it for itself, and I like it for\nthe friends it has made me.\"\n\nChampagne was not one of the commonplaces of that modest chop\nhouse.  So the waiter opened the bottle with much ceremony.  Susan\nand Etta startled when the cork popped ceilingward in the way\nthat in such places is still regarded as fashionable.  They\nwatched with interested eyes the pouring of the beautiful pale\namber liquid, were fascinated when they saw how the bubbles\nsurged upward incessantly, imprisoned joys thronging to escape.\nAnd after the first glass, the four began to have the kindliest\nfeelings for each other.  Sorrow and shame, poverty and\nforeboding, took wings unto themselves and flew away.  The girls\nfelt deliciously warm and contented, and thought the young men\ncharming--a splendid change from the coarse, badly dressed\nyouths of the tenement, with their ignorant speech and rough,\nmisshapen hands.  They were ashamed of their own hands, were\npainfully self-conscious whenever lifting the glass to the lips\nbrought them into view.  Etta's hands in fact were not so badly\nspoiled as might have been expected, considering her long years\nof rough work; the nails were in fairly good condition and the\nskin was rougher to the touch than to the sight.  Susan's hands\nhad not really been spoiled as yet.  She had been proud of them\nand had taken care of them; still, they were not the hands of a\nlady, but of a working girl.  The young men had gentlemen's\nhands--strong, evidently exercised only at sports, not at\ndegrading and deforming toil.\n\nThe shorter and handsomer youth, who answered to the name of\nFatty, for obvious but not too obvious reasons, addressed\nhimself to Etta.  John--who, it came out, was a Chicagoan,\nvisiting Fatty--fell to Susan.  The champagne made him voluble;\nhe was soon telling all about himself--a senior at Ann Arbor, as\nwas Fatty also; he intended to be a lawyer; he was fond of a\ngood, time was fond of the girls--liked girls who were gay\nrather than respectable ones--\"because with the prim girls you\nhave to quit just as the fun ought really to begin.\"\n\nAfter two glasses Susan, warned by a slight dizziness, stopped\ndrinking; Etta followed her example.  But the boys kept on,\nordered a second bottle.  \"This is the fourth we've had tonight,\"\nsaid Fatty proudly when it came.\n\n\"Don't it make you dizzy?\" asked Etta.\n\n\"Not a bit,\" Fatty assured her.  But she noticed that his tongue\nnow swung trippingly loose.\n\n\"You haven't been at--at this--long, have you?\" inquired John\nof Susan.\n\n\"Not long,\" replied she.\n\nEtta, somewhat giddied, overheard and put in, \"We began tonight.\nWe got tired of starving and freezing.\"\n\nJohn looked deepest sympathy into Susan's calm violet-gray eyes.\n\"I don't blame you,\" said he.  \"A woman does have a--a hades of\na time!\"\n\n\"We were going out to buy some clothes when you came,\" proceeded\nEtta.  \"We're in an awful state.\"\n\n\"I wondered how two girls with faces like yours,\" said John,\n\"came to be dressed so--so differently.  That was what first\nattracted us.\" Then, as Etta and Fatty were absorbed in each\nother, he went on to Susan:  \"And your eyes--I mustn't forget\nthem.  You certainly have got a beautiful face.  And your mouth--so\nsweet and sad--but, what a lovely, _lovely_ smile!\"\n\nAt this Susan smiled still more broadly with pleasure.  \"I'm glad\nyou're pleased,\" said she.\n\n\"Why, if you were dressed up----\n\n\"You're not a working girl by birth, are you?\"\n\n\"I wish I had been,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Oh, I think a girl's got as good a right as a man to have a\ngood time,\" lied John.\n\n\"Don't say things you don't believe,\" said Susan.  \"It isn't necessary.\"\n\n\"I can hand that back to you.  You weren't frank, yourself, when\nyou said you wished you'd been born in the class of your\nfriend--and of my friend Fatty, too.\"\n\nSusan's laugh was confession.  The champagne was dancing in her\nblood.  She said with a reckless toss of the head:\n\n\"I was born nothing.  So I'm free to become anything I\nplease--anything except respectable.\"\n\nHere Fatty broke in.  \"I'll tell you what let's do.  Let's all go\nshopping.  We can help you girls select your things.\"\n\nSusan laughed.  \"We're going to buy about three dollars' worth.\nThere won't be any selecting.  We'll simply take the cheapest.\"\n\n\"Then--let's go shopping,\" said John, \"and you two girls can\nhelp Fatty and me select clothes for you.\"\n\n\"That's the talk!\" cried Fatty.  And he summoned the waiter.  \"The\nbill,\" said he in the manner of a man who likes to enjoy the\nservility of servants.\n\n\"We hadn't paid for our supper,\" said Susan.  \"How much was it, Etta?\"\n\n\"A dollar twenty-five.\"\n\n\"We're going to pay for that,\" said Fatty.  \"What d'ye take us for?\"\n\n\"Oh, no.  We must pay it,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Don't be foolish.  Of course I'll pay.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan quietly, ignoring Etta's wink.  And from her\nbosom she took a crumpled five-dollar bill.\n\n\"I should say you _were_ new,\" laughed John.  \"You don't even know\nwhere to carry your money yet.\" And they all laughed, Susan and\nEtta because they felt gay and assumed the joke whatever it was\nmust be a good one.  Then John laid his hand over hers and said,\n\"Put your money away.\"\n\nSusan looked straight at him.  \"I can't allow it,\" she said.  \"I'm\nnot that poor--yet.\"\n\nJohn colored.  \"I beg your pardon,\" he said.  And when the bill\ncame he compelled Fatty to let her pay a dollar and a quarter of\nit out of her crumpled five.  The two girls were fascinated by\nthe large roll of bills--fives, tens, twenties--which Fatty took\nfrom his trousers pocket.  They stared open-eyed when he laid a\ntwenty on the waiter's plate along with Susan's five.  And it\nfrightened them when he, after handing Susan her change, had\nleft only a two-dollar bill, four silver quarters and a dime.  He\ngave the silver to the waiter.\n\n\"Was that for a tip?\" asked Susan.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Fatty.  \"I always give about ten per cent of the bill\nunless it runs over ten dollars.  In that case--a quarter a\nperson as a rule.  Of course, if the bill was very large, I'd\ngive more.\" He was showing his amusement at her inquisitiveness.\n\n\"I wanted to know,\" explained she.  \"I'm very ignorant, and I've\ngot to learn.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said John, admiringly--with a touch of\ncondescension.  \"Don't be afraid to confess ignorance.\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" replied Susan.  \"I used to be afraid of not being\nrespectable and that was all.  Now, I haven't any fear at all.\"\n\n\"You are a queer one!\" exclaimed John.  \"You oughtn't to be in\nthis life.\"\n\n\"Where then?\" asked she.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he confessed.\n\n\"Neither do I.\" Her expression suddenly was absent, with a\nquaint, slight smile hovering about her lips.  She looked at him\nmerrily.  \"You see, it's got to be something that isn't respectable.\"\n\n\"What _do_ you mean?\" demanded he.\n\nHer answer was a laugh.\n\nFatty declared it too cold to chase about afoot--\"Anyhow, it's\nlate--nearly eleven, and unless we're quick all the stores'll be\nclosed.\" The waiter called them a carriage; its driver promised\nto take them to a shop that didn't close till midnight on\nSaturdays.  Said Fatty, as they drove away:\n\n\"Well, I suppose, Etta, you'll say you've never been in a\ncarriage before.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I have,\" cried Etta.  \"Twice--at funerals.\"\n\nThis made everyone laugh--this and the champagne and the air\nwhich no longer seemed cruel to the girls but stimulating, a\ngrateful change from the close warmth of the room.  As the boys\nwere smoking cigarettes, they had the windows down.  The faces of\nboth girls were flushed and lively, and their cheeks seemed\nalready to have filled out.  The four made so much noise that the\ncrowds on the sidewalk were looking at them--looking smilingly,\ndelighted by the sight of such gayety.  Susan was even gayer than\nEtta.  She sang, she took a puff at John's cigarette; then\nlaughed loudly when he seized and kissed her, laughed again as\nshe kissed him; and she and John fell into each other's arms and\nlaughed uproariously as they saw Fatty and Etta embracing.\n\nThe driver kept his promise; eleven o'clock found them bursting\ninto Sternberg's, over the Rhine--a famous department store for\nGermans of all classes.  They had an hour, and they made good use\nof it.  Etta was for yielding to Fatty's generous urgings and\nbuying right and left.  But Susan would not have it.  She told the\nmen what she and Etta would take--a simple complete outfit, and\nno more.  Etta wanted furs and finery.  Susan kept her to plain,\nserviceable things.  Only once did she yield.  When Etta and Fatty\nbegged to be allowed a big showy hat, Susan yielded--but gave\nJohn leave to buy her only the simplest of simple hats.  \"You\nneedn't tell _me_ any yarns about your birth and breeding,\" said\nhe in a low tone so that Etta should not hear.\n\nBut that subject did not interest Susan.  \"Let's forget it,\"\nsaid she, almost curtly.  \"I've cut out the past--and the future.\nToday's enough for me.\"\n\n\"And for me, too,\" protested he.  \"I hope you're having as good\nfun as I am.\"\n\n\"This is the first time I've really laughed in nearly a year,\"\nsaid she.  \"You don't know what it means to be poor and hungry\nand cold--worst of all, cold.\"\n\n\"You unhappy child,\" said John tenderly.\n\nBut Susan was laughing again, and making jokes about a wonderful\nGerman party dress all covered with beads and lace and ruffles\nand embroidery.  When they reached the shoe department, Susan\nasked John to take Fatty away.  He understood that she was\nashamed of their patched and holed stockings, and hastened to\nobey.  They were making these their last purchases when the big\nbell rang for the closing.  \"I'm glad these poor tired shopgirls\nand clerks are set free,\" said John.\n\nIt was one of those well-meaning but worthless commonplaces of\nword-kindness that get for their utterance perhaps exaggerated\ncredit for \"good heart.\" Susan, conscience-stricken, halted.\n\"And I never once thought of them!\" she exclaimed.  \"It just shows.\"\n\n\"Shows what?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing.  Come on.  I must forget that, for I can't be happy\nagain till I do.  I understand now why the comfortable people can\nbe happy.  They keep from knowing or they make themselves forget.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said John.  \"What's the use in being miserable about\nthings that can't be helped?\"\n\n\"No use at all,\" replied the girl.  She laughed.  \"I've forgotten.\"\n\nThe carriage was so filled with their bundles that they had some\ndifficulty in making room for themselves--finally accomplished\nit by each girl sitting on her young man's lap.  They drove to a\nquietly placed, scrupulously clean little hotel overlooking\nLincoln Park.  \"We're going to take rooms here and dress,\"\nexplained Fatty.  \"Then we'll wander out and have some supper.\"\n\nBy this time Susan and Etta had lost all sense of strangeness.\nThe spirit of adventure was rampant in them as in a dreaming\nchild.  And the life they had been living--what they had seen and\nheard and grown accustomed to--made it easy for them to strike\nout at once and briskly in the new road, so different from the\ndreary and cruel path along which they had been plodding.  They\nstood laughing and joking in the parlor while the boys\nregistered; then the four went up to two small but comfortable\nand fascinatingly clean rooms with a large bathroom between.\n\"Fatty and I will go down to the bar while you two dress,\" said John.\n\n\"Not on your life!\" exclaimed Fatty.  \"We'll have the bar brought\nup to us.\"\n\nBut John, fortified by Susan's look of gratitude for his\ntactfulness, whispered to his friend--what Susan could easily\nguess.  And Fatty said, \"Oh, I never thought of it.  Yes, we'll\ngive 'em a chance.  Don't be long, girls.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Susan to John.\n\n\"That's all right.  Take your time.\"\n\nSusan locked the hall door behind the two men.  She rushed to the\nbathroom, turned on the hot water.  \"Oh, Etta!\" she cried, tears\nin her eyes, a hysterical sob in her throat.  \"A bathtub again!\"\n\nEtta too was enthusiastic; but she had not that intense\nhysterical joy which Susan felt--a joy that can be appreciated\nonly by a person who, clean by instinct and by lifelong habit,\nhas been shut out from thorough cleanliness for long months of\ndirt and foul odors and cold.  It was no easy matter to become\nclean again after all those months.  But there was plenty of soap\nand brushes and towels, and at last the thing was accomplished.\nThen they tore open the bundles and arrayed themselves in the\nfresh new underclothes, in the simple attractive costumes of\njacket, blouse and skirt.  Susan had returned to her class, and\nhad brought Etta with her.\n\n\"What shall we do with these?\" asked Etta, pointing disdainfully\nwith the toe of her new boot to the scatter of the garments they\nhad cast off.\n\nSusan looked down at it in horror.  She could not believe that\n_she_ had been wearing such stuff--that it was the clothing of\nall her associates of the past six months--was the kind of\nattire in which most of her fellow-beings went about the\nbeautiful earth, She shuddered.  \"Isn't life dreadful?\" she\ncried.  And she kicked together the tattered, patched, stained\ntrash, kicked it on to a large piece of heavy wrapping paper she\nhad spread out upon the floor.  Thus, without touching her\ndiscarded self, she got it wrapped up and bound with a strong\nstring.  She rang for the maid, gave her a quarter and pointed to\nthe bundle.  \"Please take that and throw it away,\" she said.\n\nWhen the maid was gone Etta said:  \"I'm mighty glad to have it\nout of the room.\"\n\n\"Out of the room?\" cried Susan.  \"Out of my heart.  Out of my life.\"\n\nThey put on their hats, admired themselves in the mirror, and\ndescended--Susan remembering halfway that they had left the\nlights on and going back to turn them off.  The door boy summoned\nthe two young men to the parlor.  They entered and exclaimed in\nreal amazement.  For they were facing two extremely pretty young\nwomen, one dark, the other fair.  The two faces were wreathed in\npleased and grateful smiles.\n\n\"Don't we look nice?\" demanded Etta.\n\n\"Nice!\" cried Fatty.  \"We sure did draw a pair of first\nprizes--didn't we, Johnny?\"\n\nJohn did not reply.  He was gazing at Susan.  Etta had young\nbeauty but it was of the commonplace kind.  In Susan's face and\ncarriage there was far more than beauty.  \"Where _did_ you come\nfrom?\" said John to her in an undertone.  \"And _where_ are you going?\"\n\n\"Out to supper, I hope,\" laughed she.\n\n\"Your eyes change--don't they?  I thought they were violet.  Now\nI see they're gray--gray as can be.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nAT lunch, well toward the middle of the following afternoon,\nFatty--his proper name was August Gulick--said:  \"John and I\ndon't start for Ann Arbor until a week from today.  That means\nseven clear days.  A lot can be done in that time, with a little\nintelligent hustling.  What do you say, girls?  Do you stick to us?\"\n\n\"As long as you'll let us,\" said Etta, who was delighting Gulick\nwith her frank and wondering and grateful appreciation of his\nmunificence.  Never before had his own private opinion of himself\nreceived such a flatteringly sweeping indorsement--from anyone\nwho happened to impress him as worth while.  In the last phrase\nlies the explanation of her success through a policy that is\nalways dangerous and usually a failure.\n\nSo it was settled that with the quiet little hotel as\nheadquarters the four would spend a week in exploring Cincinnati\nas a pleasure ground.  Gulick knew the town thoroughly.  His\nfather was a brewer whose name was on many a huge beer wagon\ndrawn about those streets by showy Clydesdales.  Also he had\nplenty of money; and, while Redmond--for his friend was the son\nof Redmond, well known as a lawyer-politician in Chicago--had\nnothing like so much as Gulick, still he had enough to make a\npassable pretense at keeping up his end.  For Etta and Susan the\ncity had meant shabby to filthy tenements, toil and weariness\nand sorrow.  There was opened to their ravished young eyes \"the\ncity\"--what reveals itself to the pleasure-seeker with pocket\nwell filled--what we usually think of when we pronounce its\nname, forgetting what its reality is for all but a favored few\nof those within its borders.  It was a week of music and of\nlaughter--music especially--music whenever they ate or drank,\nmusic to dance by, music in the beer gardens where they spent\nthe early evenings, music at the road houses where they arrived\nin sleighs after the dances to have supper--unless you choose to\ncall it breakfast.  You would have said that Susan had slipped\nout of the tenement life as she had out of its garments, that she\nhad retained not a trace of it even in memory.  But--in those days\nbegan her habit of never passing a beggar without giving something.\n\nWithin three or four days this life brought a truly amazing\ntransformation in the two girls.  You would not have recognized\nin them the pale and wan and ragged outcasts of only the\nSaturday night before.  \"Aren't you happy?\" said Etta to Susan,\nin one of the few moments they were alone.  \"But I don't need to\nask.  I didn't know you could be so gay.\"\n\n\"I had forgotten how to laugh,\" replied Susan.\n\n\"I suppose I ought to be ashamed,\" pursued Etta.\n\n\"Why?\" inquired Susan.\n\n\"Oh, you know why.  You know how people'd talk if they knew.\"\n\n\"What people?\" said Susan.  \"Anyone who's willing to give you anything?\"\n\n\"No,\" admitted Etta.  \"But----\"  There she halted.\n\nSusan went on:  \"I don't propose to be bothered by the other\nkind.  They wouldn't do anything for me if they could except\nsneer and condemn.\"\n\n\"Still, you know it isn't right, what we're doing.\"\n\n\"I know it isn't cold--or hunger--or rags and dirt--and bugs,\"\nreplied Susan.\n\nThose few words were enough to conjure even to Etta's duller\nfancy the whole picture to its last detail of loathsome squalor.\nInto Etta's face came a dazed expression.  \"Was that really _us_, Lorna?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan with a certain fierceness.  \"It was a dream.  But\nwe must take care not to have that dream again.\"\n\n\"I'd forgotten how cold I was,\" said Etta; \"hadn't you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan, \"I hadn't forgotten anything.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose it was all worse for you than for me.  _You_ used\nto be a lady.\"\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense,\" said Susan.\n\n\"I don't regret what I'm doing,\" Etta now declared.  \"It was Gus\nthat made me think about it.\" She looked somewhat sheepish as\nshe went on to explain.  \"I had a little too much to drink last\nnight.  And when Gus and I were alone, I cried--for no reason\nexcept the drink.  He asked me why and I had to say something,\nand it popped into my head to say I was ashamed of the life I\nwas leading.  As things turned out, I'm glad I said it.  He was\nawfully impressed.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Susan.\n\n\"You never saw anything like it,\" continued Etta with an\nexpression suggesting a feeling that she ought to be ashamed but\ncould not help being amused.  \"He acted differently right away.\nWhy don't you try it on John?\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Oh, it'll make him--make him have more--more respect for you.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" said Susan indifferently.\n\n\"Don't you want John to--to respect you?\"\n\n\"I've been too busy having a good time to think much about\nhim--or about anything.  I'm tired of thinking.  I want to rest.\nLast night was the first time in my life I danced as much as I\nwanted to.\"\n\n\"Don't you like John?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"He does know a lot, doesn't he?  He's like you.  He reads and and\nthinks--and---- He's away ahead of Fatty except---- You don't\nmind my having the man with the most money?\"\n\n\"Not in the least,\" laughed Susan.  \"Money's another thing I'm\nglad to rest from thinking about.\"\n\n\"But this'll last only a few days longer.  And--If you managed\nJohn Redmond right, Lorna----\"\n\n\"Now--you must not try to make me think.\"\n\n\"Lorna--are you _really_ happy?\"\n\n\"Can't you see I am?\"\n\n\"Yes--when we're all together.  But when--when you're alone with\nhim----\"\n\nSusan's expression stopped her.  It was a laughing expression;\nand yet--  Said Susan:  \"I am happy, dear--very happy.  I eat and\ndrink and sleep--and I am, oh, so glad to be alive.\"\n\n\"_Isn't_ it good to be alive!--if you've got plenty,\" exclaimed\nEtta.  \"I never knew before.  _This_ is the dream, Lorna--and I\nthink I'll kill myself if I have to wake.\"\n\n\nOn Saturday afternoon the four were in one of the rooms\ndiscussing where the farewell dinner should be held and what\nthey would eat and drink.  Etta called Susan into the other room\nand shut the door between.\n\n\"Fatty wants me to go along with him and live in Detroit,\" said\nshe, blurting it out as if confessing a crime.\n\n\"Isn't that splendid!\" cried Susan, kissing her.  \"I thought he\nwould.  He fell in love with you at first sight.\"\n\n\"That's what he says.  But, Lorna--I--I don't know _what_ to do!\"\n\n\"_Do_?  Why, go.  What else is there?  Go, of course.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Lorna,\" protested Etta.  \"I couldn't leave you.  I\ncouldn't get along without you.\"\n\n\"But you must go.  Don't you love him?\"\n\nEtta began to weep.  \"That's the worst of it.  I do love him so!\nAnd I think he loves me--and might marry me and make me a good\nwoman again. . . .  You mustn't ever tell John or anybody about\nthat--that dreadful man I went with--will you, dear?\"\n\n\"What do you take me for?\" said Susan.\n\n\"I've told Fatty I was a good girl until I met him.  You haven't\ntold John about yourself?\" Susan shook her head.\n\n\"I suppose not.  You're so secretive.  You really think I ought to go?\"\n\n\"I know it.\"\n\nEtta was offended by Susan's positive, practical tone.  \"I don't\nbelieve you care.\"\n\n\"Yes, I care,\" said Susan.  \"But you're right to follow the man\nyou love.  Besides, there's nothing so good in sight here.\"\n\n\"What'll _you_ do?  Oh, I can't go, Lorna!\"\n\n\"Now, Etta,\" said Susan calmly, \"don't talk nonsense.  I'll get\nalong all right.\"\n\n\"You come to Detroit.  You could find a job there, and we could\nlive together.\"\n\n\"Would Fatty like that?\"\n\nEtta flushed and glanced away.  Young Gulick had soon decided\nthat Susan was the stronger--therefore, the less \"womanly\"--of\nthe two girls, and must be the evil influence over her whom he\nhad appeared just in time to save.  When he said this to Etta,\nshe protested--not very vigorously, because she wished him to\nthink her really almost innocent.  She wasn't _quite_ easy in her\nmind as to whether she had been loyal to Lorna.  But, being\nnormally human, she soon _almost_ convinced herself that but for\nLorna she never would have made the awful venture.  Anyhow, since\nit would help her with Gulick and wouldn't do Lorna the least\nmite of harm, why not let him think he was right?\n\nSaid Susan:  \"Hasn't he been talking to you about getting away\nfrom--from all this?\"\n\n\"But I don't care,\" cried Etta, moved to an outburst of\nfrankness by her sense of security in Susan's loyalty and\ngenerosity.  \"He doesn't understand.  Men are fools about women.\nHe thinks he likes in me what I haven't got at all.  As a matter\nof fact if I had been what he made me tell him I was, why we'd\nnever have met--or got acquainted in the way that makes us so\nfond of each other.  And I owe it all to you, Lorna.  I don't care\nwhat he says, Lorna--or does.  I want you.\"\n\n\"Can't go,\" said Susan, not conscious--yet not unaware,\neither--of the curious mixture of heart and art in Etta's\noutburst of apparent eagerness to risk everything for love of\nher.  \"Can't possibly go.  I've made other plans.  The thing for\nyou is to be straight--get some kind of a job in Detroit--make\nFatty marry you--quick!\"\n\n\"He would, but his father'd throw him out.\"\n\n\"Not if you were an honest working girl.\"\n\n\"But----\"  Etta was silent and reflective for a moment.  \"Men are\nso queer,\" she finally said.  \"If I'd been an honest working girl\nhe'd never have noticed me.  It's because I am what I am that\nI've been able to get acquainted with him and fascinate him.  And\nhe feels it's a sporty thing to do--to marry a fast girl.  If I\nwas to settle down to work, be a regular working girl--why, I'm\nafraid he--he'd stop loving me.  Then, too, he likes to believe\nhe's rescuing me from a life of shame.  I've watched him close.\nI understand him.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" said Susan drily.\n\n\"Oh, I know you think I'm deceitful.  But a woman's got to be,\nwith a man.  And I care a lot about him--aside from the fact that\nhe can make me comfortable and--and protect me from--from the\nstreets.  If you cared for a man--  No, I guess you wouldn't.  You\noughtn't to be so--so _honest_, Lorna.  It'll always do you up.\"\n\nSusan laughed, shrugged her shoulders.  \"I am what I am,\" said\nshe.  \"I can't be any different.  If I tried, I'd only fail worse.\"\n\n\"You don't love John--do you?\"\n\n\"I like him.\"\n\n\"Then you wouldn't have to do _much_ pretending,\" urged Etta.\n\"And what does a little pretending amount to?\"\n\n\"That's what I say to myself,\" replied Susan thoughtfully.\n\n\"It isn't nearly as bad as--as what we started out to do.\"\n\nSusan laughed at Etta's little hypocrisy for her\nrespectability's comfort.  \"As what we did--and are doing,\"\ncorrected she.  Burlingham had taught her that it only makes\nthings worse and more difficult to lie to oneself about them.\n\n\"John's crazy about you.  But he hasn't money enough to ask you\nto come along.  And----\" Etta hesitated, eyed Susan doubtfully.\n\"You're _sure_ you don't love him?\"\n\n\"No.  I couldn't love him any more than--than I could hate him.\"\nSusan's strange look drifted across her features.  \"It's very\nqueer, how I feel toward men.  But--I don't love him and I shan't\npretend.  I want to, but somehow--I can't.\"\n\nEtta felt that she could give herself the pleasure of\nunburdening herself of a secret.  \"Then I may as well tell you,\nhe's engaged to a girl he thinks he ought to marry.\"\n\n\"I suspected so.\"\n\n\"And you don't mind?\" inquired Etta, unable to read Susan's\nqueer expression.\n\n\"Except for him--and her--a little,\" replied Susan.  \"I guess\nthat's why I haven't liked him better--haven't trusted him at all.\"\n\n\"Aren't men dreadful!  And he is so nice in many ways. . . .\nLorna----\" Etta was weeping again.  \"I can't go--I can't.  I\nmustn't leave you.\"\n\n\"Don't be absurd.  You've simply got to do it.\"\n\n\"And I do love him,\" said Etta, calmed again by Susan's\ncalmness.  \"And if he married me--Oh, how grateful I'd be!\"\n\n\"I should say!\" exclaimed Susan.  She kissed Etta and petted her.\n\"And he'll have a mighty good wife.\"\n\n\"Do you think I can marry him?\"\n\n\"If you love him--and don't worry about catching him.\"\n\nEtta shook her head in rejection of this piece of idealistic advice.\n\"But a girl's got to be shrewd.  You ought to be more so, Lorna.\"\n\n\"That depends on what a girl wants,\" said Susan, absently.  \"Upon\nwhat she wants,\" she repeated.\n\n\"What do _you_ want?\" inquired Etta curiously.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Susan answered slowly.\n\n\"I wish I knew what was going on in your head!\" exclaimed Etta.\n\n\"So do I,\" said Susan, smiling.\n\n\"Do you really mind my going?  Really--honestly?\"\n\nThere wasn't a flaw in Susan's look or tone.  \"If you tried to\nstay with me, I'd run away from you.\"\n\n\"And if I do get him, I can help you.  Once he's mine----\" Etta\nrounded out her sentence with an expression of countenance which\nit was well her adoring rescuer did not see.  Not that it lacked\nwomanliness; \"womanly\" is the word that most exactly describes\nit--and always will exactly describe such expressions--and the\nthoughts behind--so long as men compel women to be just women,\nunder penalty of refusing them support if they are not so.\n\nRedmond came in, and Etta left him alone with Susan.  \"Well, has\nEtta told you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the girl.  She looked at him--simply a look, but\nthe violet-gray eyes had an unusual seeming of seeing into minds\nand hearts, an expression that was perhaps the more disquieting\nbecause it was sympathetic rather than critical.\n\nHis glance shifted.  He was a notably handsome young fellow--too\nyoung for any display of character in his face, or for any\ndevelopment of it beyond the amiable, free and easy lover of a\njolly good time that is the type repeated over and over again\namong the youth of the comfortable classes that send their sons\nto college.\n\n\"Are you going with her?\" he asked.\n\n\"No,\" said Susan.\n\nRedmond's face fell.  \"I hoped you liked me a little better than\nthat,\" said he.\n\n\"It isn't a question of you.\"\n\n\"But it's a question of _you_ with me,\" he cried.  \"I'm in love\nwith you, Lorna.  I'm--I'm tempted to say all sorts of crazy\nthings that I think but haven't the courage to act on.\" He\nkneeled down beside her, put his arms round her waist.  \"I'm\ncrazy about you, Lorna. . . .  Tell me---- Were you---- Had\nyou been--before we met?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Why don't you deny it?\" he exclaimed.  \"Why don't you fool me,\nas Etta fooled Gus?\"\n\n\"Etta's story is different from mine,\" said Susan.  \"She's had no\nexperience at all, compared to me.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" declared he.  \"I know she's been stuffing\nFatty, has made him think that you led her away.  But I can soon\nknock those silly ideas out of his silly head----\"\n\n\"It's the truth,\" interrupted Susan, calmly.\n\n\"No matter.  You could be a good woman.\" Impulsively, \"If you'll\nsettle down and be a good woman, I'll marry you.\"\n\nSusan smiled gently.  \"And ruin your prospects?\"\n\n\"I don't care for prospects beside you.  You _are_ a good\nwoman--inside.  The better I know you the less like a fast woman\nyou are.  Won't you go to work, Lorna, and wait for me?\"\n\nHer smile had a little mockery in it now--perhaps to hide from\nhim how deeply she was moved.  \"No matter what else I did, I'd\nnot wait for you, Johnny.  You'd never come.  You're not a\nJohnny-on-the-spot.\"\n\n\"You think I'm weak--don't you?\" he said.  Then, as she did not\nanswer, \"Well, I am.  But I love you, all the same.\"\n\nFor the first time he felt that he had touched her heart.  The\ntears sprang to her eyes, which were not at all gray now but all\nviolet, as was their wont when she was deeply moved.  She laid\nher hands on his shoulders.  \"Oh, it's so good to be loved!\" she\nmurmured.\n\nHe put his arms around her, and for the moment she rested there,\ncontent--yes, content, as many a woman who needed love less and\ncraved it less has been content just with being loved, when to\nmake herself content she has had to ignore and forget the\npersonality of the man who was doing the loving--and the kind of\nlove it was.  Said he:\n\n\"Don't you love me a little enough to be a good woman and wait\ntill I set up in the law?\"\n\nShe let herself play with the idea, to prolong this novel\nfeeling of content.  She asked, \"How long will that be?\"\n\n\"I'll be admitted in two years.  I'll soon have a practice.  My\nfather's got influence.\"\n\nSusan looked at him sadly, slowly shook her head.  \"Two\nyears--and then several years more.  And I working in a\nfactory--or behind a counter--from dawn till after dark--poor,\nhungry--half-naked--wearing my heart out--wearing my body\naway----\"  She drew away from him, laughed.  \"I was fooling,\nJohn--about marrying.  I liked to hear you say those things.  I\ncouldn't marry you if I would.  I'm married already.\"\n\n\"_You_!\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"Tell me about it--won't you?\"\n\nShe looked at him in astonishment, so amazing seemed the idea\nthat she could tell anyone that experience.  It would be like\nvoluntarily showing a hideous, repulsive scar or wound, for\nsometimes it was scar, and sometimes open wound, and always the\nthing that made whatever befell her endurable by comparison.\n\nShe did not answer his appeal for her confidence but went on,\n\"Anyhow, nothing could induce me to go to work again.  You don't\nrealize what work means--the only sort of work I can get to do.\nIt's--it's selling both body and soul.  I prefer----\"\n\nHe kissed her to stop her from finishing her sentence.\n\"Don't--please,\" he pleaded.  \"You don't understand.  In this life\nyou'll soon grow hard and coarse and lose your beauty and your\nhealth--and become a moral and physical wreck.\"\n\nShe reflected, the grave expression in her eyes--the expression\nthat gave whoever saw it the feeling of dread as before\nimpending tragedy.  \"Yes--I suppose so,\" she said.  \"But----\nAny sooner than as a working girl living in a dirty hole in a\ntenement?  No--not so soon.  And in this life I've got a chance if\nI'm careful of my health and--and don't let things touch _me_.  In\nthat other--there's no chance--none!\"\n\n\"What chance have you got in this life?\"\n\n\"I don't know exactly.  I'm very ignorant yet.  At worst, it's\nsimply that I've got no chance in either life--and this life is\nmore comfortable.\"\n\n\"Comfortable!  With men you don't like--frightful men----\"\n\n\"Were you ever cold?\" asked Susan.\n\nBut it made no impression upon him who had no conception of the\ncold that knows not how it is ever to get warm again.  He rushed on:\n\n\"Lorna, my God!\" He caught hold of her and strained her to his\nbreast.  \"You are lovely and sweet!  It's frightful--you in this life.\"\n\nHer expression made the sobs choke up into his throat.  She said\nquietly:  \"Not worse than dirt and vermin and freezing cold and\nlong, long, dull--oh, _so_ dull hours of working among human\nbeings that don't ever wash--because they can't.\" She pushed him\ngently away.  \"You don't understand.  You haven't been through it.\nComfortable people talk like fools about those things. . . .  Do\nyou remember my hands that first evening?\"\n\nHe reddened and his eyes shifted.  \"I'm absurdly sensitive about\na woman's hands,\" he muttered.\n\nShe laughed at him.  \"Oh, I saw--how you couldn't bear to look\nat them--how they made you shiver.  Well, the hands were\nnothing--_nothing_!--beside what you didn't see.\"\n\n\"Lorna, do you love someone else?\"\n\nHis eyes demanded an honest answer, and it seemed to her his\nfeeling for her deserved it.  But she could not put the answer\ninto words.  She lowered her gaze.\n\n\"Then why----\" he began impetuously.  But there he halted, for he\nknew she would not lift the veil over herself, over her past.\n\n\"I'm very, very fond of you,\" she said with depressing\nfriendliness.  Then with a sweet laugh, \"You ought to be glad I'm\nnot able to take you at your word.  And you will be glad soon.\"\nShe sighed.  \"What a good time we've had!\"\n\n\"If I only had a decent allowance, like Fatty!\" he groaned.\n\n\"No use talking about that.  It's best for us to separate best\nfor us both.  You've been good to me--you'll never know how good.\nAnd I can't play you a mean trick.  I wish I could be selfish\nenough to do it, but I can't.\"\n\n\"You don't love me.  That's the reason.\"\n\n\"Maybe it is.  Yes, I guess that's why I've got the courage to be\nsquare with you.  Anyhow, John, you can't afford to care for me.\nAnd if I cared for you, and put off the parting--why it'd only\nput off what I've got to go through with before----\" She did not\nfinish; her eyes became dreamy.\n\n\"Before what?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said, returning with a sigh.  \"Something I\nsee--yet don't see in the darkness, ahead of me.\"\n\n\"I can't make you out,\" cried he.  Her expression moved him to\nthe same awe she inspired in Etta--a feeling that gave both of\nthem the sense of having known her better, of having been more\nintimate with her when they first met her than they ever had\nbeen since or ever would be again.\n\nWhen Redmond embraced and kissed her for the last time, he was\nin another and less sympathetic mood, was busy with his own\nwounds to vanity and perhaps to heart.  He thought her\nheartless--good and sweet and friendly, but without sentiment.\nShe refused to help him make a scene; she refused to say she\nwould write to him, and asked him not to write to her.  \"You know\nwe'll probably see each other soon.\"\n\n\"Not till the long vacation--not till nearly July.\"\n\n\"Only three months.\"\n\n\"Oh, if you look at it that way!\" said he, piqued and sullen.\nGirls had always been more than kind, more than eager, when he\nhad shown interest.\n\nEtta, leaving on a later train, was even more depressed about\nSusan's heart.  She wept hysterically, wished Susan to do the\nsame; but Susan stood out firmly against a scene, and would not\nhave it that Etta was shamefully deserting her, as Etta\ntearfully accused herself.  \"You're going to be happy,\" she\nsaid.  \"And I'm not so selfish as to be wretched about it.  And\ndon't you worry a minute on my account.  I'm better off in every\nway than I've ever been.  I'll get on all right.\"\n\n\"I know you gave up John to help me with August.  I know you mean\nto break off everything.  Oh, Lorna, you mustn't--you mustn't.\"\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense,\" was Susan's unsatisfactory reply.\n\nWhen it came down to the last embrace and the last kiss, Etta\ndid feel through Susan's lips and close encircling arms a\nsomething that dried up her hysterical tears and filled her\nheart with an awful aching.  It did not last long.  No matter how\nwildly shallow waters are stirred, they soon calm and murmur\nplacidly on again.  The three who had left her would have been\namazed could they have seen her a few minutes after Etta's train\nrolled out of the Union Station.  The difference between strong\nnatures and weak is not that the strong are free from cowardice\nand faint-heartedness, from doubt and foreboding, from love and\naffection, but that they do not stay down when they are crushed\ndown, stagger up and on.\n\nSusan hurried to the room they had helped her find the day\nbefore--a room in a house where no questions were asked or\nanswered.  She locked herself in and gave way to the agonies of\nher loneliness.  And when her grief had exhausted her, she lay\nupon the bed staring at the wall with eyes that looked as though\nher soul had emptied itself through them of all that makes life\nendurable, even of hope.  For the first time in her life she\nthought of suicide--not suicide the vague possibility, not\nsuicide the remote way of escape, but suicide the close and\nintimate friend, the healer of all woes, the solace of all\ngriefs--suicide, the speedy, accurate solver of the worst\nproblem destiny can put to man.\n\nShe saw her pocketbook on the floor where she had dropped it.\n\"I'll wait till my money's gone,\" thought she.  Then she\nremembered Etta--how gentle and loving she was, how utterly she\ngave herself--for Susan was still far from the profound\nknowledge of character that enables us to disregard outward\nsigns in measuring actualities.  \"If I really weren't harder than\nEtta,\" her thoughts ran on reproachfully, \"I'd not wait until\nthe money went.  I'd kill myself now, and have it over with.\" The\ntruth was that if the position of the two girls had been\nreversed and Susan had loved Gulick as intensely as Etta\nprofessed and believed she loved him, still Susan would have\ngiven him up rather than have left Etta alone.  And she would\nhave done it without any sense of sacrifice.  And it must be\nadmitted that, whether or not there are those who deserve credit\nfor doing right, certainly those who do right simply because\nthey cannot do otherwise--the only trustworthy people--deserve\nno credit for it.\n\nShe counted her money--twenty-three dollars in bills, and some\nchange.  Redmond had given her fifty dollars each time they had\ngone shopping, and had made her keep the balance--his indirect\nway of adjusting the financial side.  Twenty-three dollars meant\nperhaps two weeks' living.  Well, she would live those two weeks\ndecently and comfortably and then--bid life adieu unless\nsomething turned up--for back to the streets she would not go.\nWith Etta gone, with not a friend anywhere on earth, life was\nnot worth the price she had paid for Etta and herself to the\ndrunken man.  Her streak of good fortune in meeting Redmond had\ngiven her no illusions; from Mabel Connemora, from what she\nherself had heard and seen--and experienced--she knew the street\nwoman's life, and she could not live that life for herself\nalone.  She could talk about it to Redmond tranquilly.  She could\nthink about it in the abstract, could see how other women did\nit, and how those who had intelligence might well survive and\nlift themselves up in it.  But do it she could not.  So she\nresolved upon suicide, firmly believing in her own resolve.  And\nshe was not one to deceive herself or to shrink from anything\nwhatsoever.  Except the insane, only the young make these\nresolves and act upon them; for the young have not yet learned\nto value life, have not yet fallen under life's sinister spell\nthat makes human beings cling more firmly and more cravenly to\nit as they grow older.  The young must have something--some hope,\nhowever fanatic and false--to live for.  They will not tarry just\nto live.  And in that hour Susan had lost hope.\n\nShe took off her street dress and opened her trunk to get a\nwrapper and bedroom slippers.  As she lifted the lid, she saw an\nenvelope addressed \"Lorna\"; she remembered that Redmond had\nlocked and strapped the trunk.  She tore the end from the\nenvelope, looked in.  Some folded bills; nothing more.  She sat on\nthe floor and counted two twenties, five tens, two fives--a\nhundred dollars!  She looked dazedly at the money--gave a cry of\ndelight--sprang to her feet, with a change like the startling\nshift from night to day in the tropics.\n\n\"I can pay!\" she cried.  \"I can pay!\"\n\nBubbling over with smiles and with little laughs, gay as even\nchampagne and the release from the vile prison of the slums had\nmade her, she with eager hands took from the trunk her best\nclothes--the jacket and skirt of dark gray check she had bought\nfor thirty dollars at Shillito's and had had altered to her\nfigure and her taste; the blouse of good quality linen with\nrather a fancy collar; the gray leather belt with a big\noxidized silver buckle; her only pair of silk stockings; the\npair of high-heeled patent leather shoes--the large black hat\nwith a gray feather curling attractively round and over its\nbrim.  The hat had cost only fourteen dollars because she had put\nit together herself; if she had bought it made, she would have\npaid not less than thirty dollars.\n\nAll these things she carefully unpacked and carefully laid out.\nThen she thoroughly brushed her hair and did it up in a graceful\npompadour that would go well with the hat.  She washed away the\ntraces of her outburst of grief, went over her finger nails, now\nalmost recovered from the disasters incident to the life of\nmanual labor.  She went on to complete her toilet, all with the\nsame attention to detail--a sure indication, in one so young, of\na desire to please some specific person.  When she had the hat\nset at the satisfactory angle and the veil wound upon it and\ndraped over her fresh young face coquettishly, she took from her\nslender store of gloves a fresh gray pair and, as she put them\non, stood before the glass examining herself.\n\nThere was now not a trace of the tenement working girl of a week\nand a day before.  Here was beauty in bloom, fresh and alluring\nfrom head to narrow, well-booted feet.  More than a hint of a\nfine color sense--that vital quality, if fashion, the\nconventional, is to be refined and individualized into style,\nthe rare--more than a hint of color sense showed in the harmony\nof the pearl gray in the big feather, the pearl gray in the\ncollar of the blouse, and the pearl white of her skin.  Susan had\nindeed returned to her own class.  She had left it, a small-town\ngirl with more than a suggestion of the child in eyes and mouth;\nshe had returned to it, a young woman of the city, with that\nlook in her face which only experience can give--experience that\nhas resulted in growth.  She locked all her possessions away in\nher trunk--all but her money; that she put in her\nstockings--seventy-five dollars well down in the right leg, the\nrest of the bills well down in the left leg; the two dollars or\nso in change was all she intrusted to the pocketbook she\ncarried.  She cast a coquettish glance down at her charmingly\narrayed feet--a harmless glance of coquetry that will be\ncondemned by those whose physical vanity happens to center\nelsewhere.  After this glance she dropped her skirts--and was ready.\n\nBy this time dusk had fallen, and it was nearly six o'clock.  As\nshe came out of the house she glanced toward the west--the\ninstinctive gesture of people who live in rainy climates.  Her\nface brightened; she saw an omen in the long broad streak of\nreddened evening sky.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nSHE went down to Fourth Street, along it to Race, to the\n_Commercial_ building.  At the entrance to the corridor at the far\nside of which were elevator and stairway, she paused and\nconsidered.  She turned into the business office.\n\n\"Is Mr. Roderick Spenser here?\" she asked of a heavily built,\ngray-bearded man in the respectable black of the old-fashioned\nfinancial employee, showing the sobriety and stolidity of his\ncharacter in his dress.\n\n\"He works upstairs,\" replied the old man, beaming approvingly\nupon the pretty, stylish young woman.\n\n\"Is he there now?\"\n\n\"I'll telephone.\" He went into the rear office, presently\nreturned with the news that Mr. Spenser had that moment left,\nwas probably on his way down in the elevator.  \"And you'll catch\nhim if you go to the office entrance right away.\"\n\nSusan, the inexperienced in the city ways of men with women, did\nnot appreciate what a tribute to her charms and to her\ncharacter, as revealed in the honest, grave eyes, was the old\nman's unhesitating assumption that Spenser would wish to see\nher.  She lost no time in retracing her steps.  As she reached the\noffice entrance she saw at the other end of the long hall two\nyoung men coming out of the elevator.  After the habit of youth,\nshe had rehearsed speech and manner for this meeting; but at\nsight of him she was straightway trembling so that she feared\nshe would be unable to speak at all.  The entrance light was dim,\nbut as he glanced at her in passing he saw her looking at him\nand his hand moved toward his hat.  His face had not changed--the\nsame frank, careless expression, the same sympathetic,\nunderstanding look out of the eyes.  But he was the city man in\ndress now--notably the city man.\n\n\"Mr. Spenser,\" said she shyly.\n\nHe halted; his companion went on.  He lifted his hat, looked\ninquiringly at her--the look of the enthusiast and connoisseur\non the subject of pretty women, when he finds a new specimen\nworthy of his attention.\n\n\"Don't you know me?\"\n\nHis expression of puzzled and flirtatious politeness gradually\ncleared away.  The lighting up of his eyes, the smile round his\nmouth delighted her; and she grew radiant when he exclaimed\neagerly, \"Why, it's the little girl of the rock again!  How\nyou've grown--in a year--less than a year!\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose I have,\" said she, thinking of it for the first\ntime.  Then, to show him at once what a good excuse she had for\nintruding again, she hastened to add, \"I've come to pay you that\nmoney you loaned me.\"\n\nHe burst out laughing, drew her into the corridor where the\nlight was brighter.  \"And you've gone back to your husband,\" he\nsaid--she noted the quick, sharp change in his voice.\n\n\"Why do you think that?\" she said.\n\nThe way his eyes lingered upon the charming details toilet that\nindicated anything but poverty might of a have given her a\nsimple explanation.  He offered another.\n\n\"I can't explain.  It's your different expression--a kind of\nexperienced look.\"\n\nThe color flamed and flared in Susan's face.\n\n\"You are--happy?\" he asked.\n\n\"I've not seen--him,\" evaded she.  \"Ever since I left Carrollton\nI've been wandering about.\"\n\n\"Wandering about?\" he repeated absently, his eyes busy with\nher appearance.\n\n\"And now,\" she went on, nervous and hurried, \"I'm here in\ntown--for a while.\"\n\n\"Then I may come to see you?\"\n\n\"I'd be glad.  I'm alone in a furnished room I've taken--out near\nLincoln Park.\"\n\n\"Alone!  You don't mean you're still wandering?\"\n\n\"Still wandering.\"\n\nHe laughed.  \"Well, it certainly is doing you no harm.  The\nreverse.\" An embarrassed pause, then he said with returning\npoliteness:  \"Maybe you'll dine with me this evening?\"\n\nShe beamed.  \"I've been hoping you'd ask me.\"\n\n\"It won't be as good as the one on the rock.\"\n\n\"There never will be another dinner like that,\" declared she.\n\"Your leg is well?\"\n\nHer question took him by surprise.  In his interest and wonder as\nto the new mystery of this mysterious young person he had not\nrecalled the excuses he made for dropping out of the\nentanglement in which his impulses had put him.  The color poured\ninto his face.  \"Ages ago,\" he replied, hurriedly.  \"I'd have\nforgotten it, if it hadn't been for you.  I've never been able to\nget you out of my head.\" And as a matter of truth she had\nfinally dislodged his cousin Nell--without lingering long or\nvividly herself.  Young Mr. Spenser was too busy and too\nself-absorbed a man to bother long about any one flower in a\nworld that was one vast field abloom with open-petaled flowers.\n\n\"Nor I you,\" said she, as pleased as he had expected, and\nshowing it with a candor that made her look almost the child he\nhad last seen.  \"You see, I owed you that money, and I wanted to\npay it.\"\n\n\"Oh--_that_ was all!\" exclaimed he, half jokingly.  \"Wait here a\nminute.\" And he went to the door, looked up and down the street,\nthen darted across it and disappeared into the St. Nicholas\nHotel.  He was not gone more than half a minute.\n\n\"I had to see Bayne and tell him,\" he explained when he was with\nher again.  \"I was to have dined with him and some others--over\nin the café.  Instead, you and I will dine upstairs.  You won't\nmind my not being dressed?\"\n\nIt seemed to her he was dressed well enough for any occasion.\n\"I'd rather you had on the flannel trousers rolled up to your\nknees,\" said she.  \"But I can imagine them.\"\n\n\"What a dinner that was!\" cried he.  \"And the ride afterward,\"\nwith an effort at ease that escaped her bedazzled eyes.  \"Why\ndidn't you ever write?\"\n\nHe expected her to say that she did not know his address, and\nwas ready with protests and excuses.  But she replied:\n\n\"I didn't have the money to pay what I owed you.\" They were\ncrossing Fourth Street and ascending the steps to the hotel.\n\"Then, too--afterward--when I got to know a little more about\nlife I----Oh, no matter.  Really, the money was the only reason.\"\n\nBut he had stopped short.  In a tone so correctly sincere that a\nsuspicious person might perhaps have doubted the sincerity of\nthe man using it, he said:\n\n\"What was in your mind?  What did you think?  What did\nyou--suspect me of?  For I see in that honest, telltale face of\nyours that it was a suspicion.\"\n\n\"I didn't blame you,\" protested the girl, \"even if it was so.  I\nthought maybe you got to thinking it over--and--didn't want to be\nbothered with anyone so troublesome as I had made myself.\"\n\n\"How _could_ you suspect _me_ of such a thing?\"\n\n\"Oh, I really didn't,\" declared she, with all the earnestness of\na generous nature, for she read into his heightened color and\naverted eyes the feelings she herself would have had before an\nunjust suspicion.  \"It was merely an idea.  And I didn't blame\nyou--not in the least.  It would have been the sensible----\"\n\nNext thing, this child-woman, this mysterious mind of mixed\nprecocity and innocence, would be showing that she had guessed\na Cousin Nell.\n\n\"You are far too modest,\" interrupted he with a flirtatious\nsmile.  \"You didn't realize how strong an impression you made.\nNo, I really broke my leg.  Don't you suppose I knew the\ntwenty-five in the pocketbook wouldn't carry you far?\" He\nsaw--and naturally misunderstood--her sudden change of\nexpression as he spoke of the amount.  He went on apologetically,\n\"I intended to bring more when I came.  I was afraid to put money\nin the note for fear it'd never be delivered, if I did.  And\ndidn't I tell you to write--and didn't I give you my address\nhere?  Would I have done that, if I hadn't meant to stand by you?\"\n\nSusan was convinced, was shamed by these smooth, plausible\nassertions and explanations.  \"Your father's house--it's a big\nbrick, with stone trimmings, standing all alone outside the\nlittle town--isn't it?\"\n\nSpenser was again coloring deeply.  \"Yes,\" admitted he uneasily.\n\nBut Susan didn't notice.  \"I saw the doctor--and your family--on\nthe veranda,\" she said.\n\nHe was now so nervous that she could not but observe it.  \"They\ngave out that it was only a sprain,\" said he, \"because I told\nthem I didn't want it known.  I didn't want the people at the\noffice to know I was going to be laid up so long.  I was afraid\nI'd lose my job.\"\n\n\"I didn't hear anything about it,\" said she.  \"I only saw as I\nwas going by on a boat.\"\n\nHe looked disconcerted--but not to her eyes.  \"Well--it's far in\nthe past now,\" said he.  \"Let's forget--all but the fun.\"\n\n\"Yes--all but the fun.\" Then very sweetly, \"But I'll never forget\nwhat I owe you.  Not the money--not that, hardly at all--but what\nyou did for me.  It made me able to go on.\"\n\n\"Don't speak of it,\" cried he, flushed and shamefaced.  \"I didn't\ndo half what I ought.\" Like most human beings he was aware of\nhis more obvious--if less dangerous--faults and weaknesses.  He\nliked to be called generous, but always had qualms when so\ncalled because he knew he was in fact of the familiar type\nclassed as generous only because human beings are so artless in\ntheir judgments as to human nature that they cannot see that\nquick impulses quickly die.  The only deep truth is that there\nare no generous natures but just natures--and they are rarely\nclassed as generous because their slowly formed resolves have\nthe air of prudence and calculation.\n\nIn the hotel she went to the dressing-room, took twenty-five\ndollars from the money in her stocking.  As soon as they were\nseated in the restaurant she handed it to him.\n\n\"But this makes it you who are having me to dinner--and more,\"\nhe protested.\n\n\"If you knew what a weight it's been on me, you'd not talk that\nway,\" said she.\n\nHer tone compelled him to accept her view of the matter.  He\nlaughed and put the money in his waistcoat pocket, saying:  \"Then\nI'll still owe you a dinner.\"\n\nDuring the past week she had been absorbing as only a young\nwoman with a good mind and a determination to learn the business\nof living can absorb.  The lessons before her had been the life\nthat is lived in cities by those who have money to spend and\nexperience in spending it; she had learned out of all proportion\nto opportunity.  At a glance she realized that she was now in a\nplace far superior to the Bohemian resorts which had seemed to\nher inexperience the best possible.  From earliest childhood she\nhad shown the delicate sense of good taste and of luxury that\nalways goes with a practical imagination--practical as\ndistinguished from the idealistic kind of imagination that is\nvague, erratic, and fond of the dreams which neither could nor\nshould come true.  And the reading she had done--the novels, the\nmemoirs, the books of travel, the fashion and home\nmagazines--had made deep and distinct impressions upon her, had\nprepared her--as they have prepared thousands of Americans in\nsecluded towns and rural regions where luxury and even comfort\nare very crude indeed--for the possible rise of fortune that is\nthe universal American dream and hope.  She felt these new\nsurroundings exquisitely--the subdued coloring, the softened\nlights, the thick carpets, the quiet elegance and comfort of the\nfurniture.  She noted the good manners of the well-trained\nwaiter; she listened admiringly and memorizingly as Spenser\nordered the dinner--a dinner of French good taste--small but\nfine oysters, a thick soup, a guinea hen _en casserole_, a fruit\nsalad, fresh strawberry ice cream, dry champagne.  She saw that\nSpenser knew what he was about, and she was delighted with him\nand proud to be with him and glad that he had tastes like her\nown--that is, tastes such as she proposed to learn to have.  Of\nthe men she had known or known about he seemed to her far and\naway the best.  It isn't necessary to explain into what an\nattitude of mind and heart this feeling of his high superiority\nimmediately put her--certainly not for the enlightenment of any woman.\n\n\"What are you thinking?\" he asked--the question that was so\noften thrust at her because, when she thought intensely, there\nwas a curiosity-compelling expression in her eyes.\n\n\"Oh--about all this,\" replied she.  \"I like this sort of thing so\nmuch.  I never had it in my life, yet now that I see it I feel as\nif I were part of it, as if it must belong to me.\" Her eyes met\nhis sympathetic gaze.  \"You understand, don't you?\" He nodded.\n\"And I was wondering\"--she laughed, as if she expected even him\nto laugh at her--\"I was wondering how long it would be before I\nshould possess it.  Do you think I'm crazy?\"\n\nHe shook his head.  \"I've got that same feeling,\" said he.  \"I'm\npoor--don't dare do this often--have all I can manage in keeping\nmyself decently.  Yet I have a conviction that I shall--shall\nwin.  Don't think I'm dreaming of being rich--not at all.  I--I\ndon't care much about that if I did go into business.  But I want\nall my surroundings to be right.\"\n\nHer eyes gleamed.  \"And you'll get it.  And so shall I.  I know it\nsounds improbable and absurd for me to say that about myself.\nBut--I know it.\"\n\n\"I believe you,\" said he.  \"You've got the look in your face--in\nyour eyes. . . .  I've never seen anyone improve as you have in\nthis less than a year.\"\n\nShe smiled as she thought in what surroundings she had\napparently spent practically all that time.  \"If you could have\nseen me!\" she said.  \"Yes, I was learning and I know it.  I led a\nsort of double life.  I----\" she hesitated, gave up trying to\nexplain.  She had not the words and phrases, the clear-cut ideas,\nto express that inner life led by people who have real\nimagination.  With most human beings their immediate visible\nsurroundings determine their life; with the imaginative few\ntheir horizon is always the whole wide world.\n\nShe sighed, \"But I'm ignorant.  I don't know how or where to\ntake hold.\"\n\n\"I can't help you there, yet,\" said he.  \"When we know each other\nbetter, then I'll know.  Not that you need me to tell you.  You'll\nfind out for yourself.  One always does.\"\n\nShe glanced round the attractive room again, then looked at him\nwith narrowed eyelids.  \"Only a few hours ago I was thinking of\nsuicide.  How absurd it seems now!--I'll never do that again.  At\nleast, I've learned how to profit by a lesson.  Mr. Burlingham\ntaught me that.\"\n\n\"Who's he?\"\n\n\"That's a long story.  I don't feel like telling about it now.\"\n\nBut the mere suggestion had opened certain doors in her memory\nand crowds of sad and bitter thoughts came trooping in.\n\n\"Are you in some sort of trouble?\" said he, instantly leaning\ntoward her across the table and all aglow with the impulsive\nsympathy that kindles in impressionable natures as quickly as\nfire in dry grass.  Such natures are as perfect conductors of\nemotion as platinum is of heat--instantly absorbing it,\ninstantly throwing it off, to return to their normal and\nmetallic chill--and capacity for receptiveness.  \"Anything you\ncan tell me about?\"\n\n\"Oh, no--nothing especial,\" replied she.  \"Just loneliness and a\nfeeling of--of discouragement.\" Strongly, \"Just a mood.  I'm\nnever really discouraged.  Something always turns up.\"\n\n\"Please tell me what happened after I left you at that wretched hotel.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" she said.  \"At least, not now.\"\n\n\"There is----\" He looked sympathetically at her, as if to assure\nher that he would understand, no matter what she might confess.\n\"There is--someone?\"\n\n\"No.  I'm all alone.  I'm--free.\" It was not in the least degree an\ninstinct for deception that made her then convey an impression\nof there having been no one.  She was simply obeying her innate\nreticence that was part of her unusual self-unconsciousness.\n\n\"And you're not worried about--about money matters?\" he asked.\n\"You see, I'm enough older and more experienced to give me\nexcuse for asking.  Besides, unless a woman has money, she\ndoesn't find it easy to get on.\"\n\n\"I've enough for the present,\" she assured him, and the stimulus\nof the champagne made her look--and feel--much more\nself-confident than she really was.  \"More than I've ever had\nbefore.  So I'm not worried.  When anyone has been through what I\nhave they aren't so scared about the future.\"\n\nHe looked the admiration he felt--and there was not a little of\nthe enthusiasm of the champagne both in the look and in the\nadmiration--\"I see you've already learned to play the game\nwithout losing your nerve.\"\n\n\"I begin to hope so,\" said she.\n\n\"Yes--you've got the signs of success in your face.  Curious\nabout those signs.  Once you learn to know them, you never miss\nin sizing up people.\"\n\nThe dinner had come.  Both were hungry, and it was as good a\ndinner as the discussion about it between Spenser and the waiter\nhad forecast.  As they ate the well-cooked, well-served food and\ndrank the delicately flavored champagne, mellow as the gorgeous\nautumn its color suggested, there diffused through them an\nextraordinary feeling of quiet intense happiness--happiness of\nmind and body.  Her face took on a new and finer beauty; into his\nface came a tenderness that was most becoming to its rather\nrugged features.  And he had not talked with her long before he\ndiscovered that he was facing not a child, not a child-woman, but\na woman grown, one who could understand and appreciate the\nthings men and women of experience say and do.\n\n\"I've always been expecting to hear from you every day since we\nseparated,\" he said--and he was honestly believing it now.  \"I've\nhad a feeling that you hadn't forgotten me.  It didn't seem\npossible I could feel so strongly unless there was real sympathy\nbetween us.\"\n\n\"I came as soon as I could.\"\n\nHe reflected in silence a moment, then in a tone that made her\nheart leap and her blood tingle, he said:  \"You say you're free?\"\n\n\"Free as air.  Only--I couldn't fly far.\"\n\nHe hesitated on an instinct of prudence, then ventured.  \"Far as\nNew York?\"\n\n\"What is the railroad fare?\"\n\n\"Oh, about twenty-five dollars--with sleeper.\"\n\n\"Yes--I can fly that far.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say you've no ties of any kind?\"\n\n\"None.  Not one.\" Her eyes opened wide and her nostrils dilated.  \"Free!\"\n\n\"You love it--don't you?\"\n\n\"Don't you?\"\n\n\"Above everything!\" he exclaimed.  \"Only the free _live_.\"\n\nShe lifted her head higher in a graceful, attractive gesture of\nconfidence and happiness.  \"Well--I am ready to live.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you don't realize,\" he said hesitatingly.  \"People\nwouldn't understand.  You've your reputation to think of, you know.\"\n\nShe looked straight at him.  \"No--not even that.  I'm even free\nfrom reputation.\" Then, as his face saddened and his eyes\nglistened with sympathy, \"You needn't pity me.  See where it's\nbrought me.\"\n\n\"You're a strong swimmer--aren't you?\" he said tenderly.  \"But\nthen there isn't any safe and easy crossing to the isles of\nfreedom.  It's no wonder most people don't get further than\ngazing and longing.\"\n\n\"Probably I shouldn't,\" confessed Susan, \"if I hadn't been\nthrown into the water.  It was a case of swim or drown.\"\n\n\"But most who try are drowned--nearly all the women.\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess there are more survive than is generally supposed.\nSo much lying is done about that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"What a shrewd young lady it is!  At any rate, you have reached\nthe islands.\"\n\n\"But I'm not queen of them yet,\" she reminded him.  \"I'm only a\npoor, naked, out-of-breath castaway lying on the beach.\"\n\nHe laughed appreciatively.  Very clever, this extremely pretty\nyoung woman.  \"Yes--you'll win.  You'll be queen.\" He lifted his\nchampagne glass and watched the little bubbles pushing gayly and\nswiftly upward.  \"So--you've cast over your reputation.\"\n\n\"I told you I had reached the beach naked.\" A reckless light in\nher eyes now.  \"Fact is, I had none to start with.  Anybody has a\nreason for starting--or for being started.  That was mine, I guess.\"\n\n\"I've often thought about that matter of reputation--in a man or\na woman--if they're trying to make the bold, strong swim.  To\ncare about one's reputation means fear of what the world says.\nIt's important to care about one's character--for without\ncharacter no one ever got anywhere worth getting to.  But it's\nvery, very dangerous to be afraid for one's reputation.  And--I\nhate to admit it, because I'm hopelessly conventional at bottom,\nbut it's true--reputation--fear of what the world says--has sunk\nmore swimmers, has wrecked more characters than it ever helped.\nSo--the strongest and best swimmers swim naked.\"\n\nSusan was looking thoughtfully at him over the rim of her glass.\nShe took a sip of the champagne, said:  \"If I hadn't been quite\nnaked, I'd have sunk--I'd have been at the bottom--with the\nfishes----\"\n\n\"Don't!\" he cried.  \"Thank God, you did whatever you've\ndone--yes, I mean that--whatever you've done, since it enabled\nyou to swim on.\" He added, \"And I know it wasn't anything\nbad--anything unwomanly.\"\n\n\"I did the best I could--nothing I'm ashamed of--or proud of\neither.  Just--what I had to do.\"\n\n\"But you ought to be proud that you arrived.\"\n\n\"No--only glad,\" said she.  \"So--so _frightfully_ glad!\"\n\nIn any event, their friendship was bound to flourish; aided by\nthat dinner and that wine it sprang up into an intimacy, a\nfeeling of mutual trust and of sympathy at every point.  Like all\nwomen she admired strength in a man above everything else.  She\ndelighted in the thick obstinate growth of his fair hair, in the\nbreadth of the line of his eyebrows, in the aggressive thrust of\nhis large nose and long jawbone.  She saw in the way his mouth\nclosed evidence of a will against which opposition would dash\nabout as dangerously as an egg against a stone wall.  There was\nno question of his having those birthmarks of success about\nwhich he talked.  She saw them--saw nothing of the less\nobtrusive--but not less important--marks of weakness which might\nhave enabled an expert in the reading of faces to reach some\nrather depressing conclusion as to the nature and the degree of\nthat success.\n\nFinally, he burst out with, \"Yes, I've made up my mind.  I'll do\nit!  I'm going to New York.  I've been fooling away the last five\nyears here learning a lot, but still idling--drinking--amusing\nmyself in all kinds of ways.  And about a month ago--one night,\nas I was rolling home toward dawn--through a driving sleet\nstorm--do you remember a line in 'Paradise Lost'\"\n\n\"I never read it,\" interrupted Susan.\n\n\"Well--it's where the devils have been kicked out of Heaven and\nare lying in agony flat on the burning lake--and Satan rises\nup--and marches haughtily out among them--and calls out, 'Awake!\nArise!  Or forever more be damned!' That's what has happened to\nme several times in my life.  When I was a boy, idling about the\nfarm and wasting myself, that voice came to me--'Awake!  Arise!\nOr forever more be damned!' And I got a move on me, and insisted\non going to college.  Again--at college--I became a\ndawdler--poker--drink--dances--all the rest of it.  And suddenly\nthat voice roared in my ears, made me jump like a rabbit when a\ngun goes off.  And last month it came again.  I went to\nwork--finished a play I've been pottering over for three years.\nBut somehow I couldn't find the--the--whatever I needed--to make\nme break away.  Well--_you've_ given me that.  I'll resign from the\n_Commercial_ and with all I've got in the world--three hundred\ndollars and a trunk full of good clothes, I'll break into Broadway.\"\n\nSusan had listened with bright eyes and quickened breath, as\nintoxicated and as convinced as was he by his eloquence.\n\"Isn't that splendid!\" she exclaimed in a low voice.\n\n\"And you?\" he said meaningly.\n\n\"I?\" she replied, fearing she was misunderstanding.\n\n\"Will you go?\"\n\n\"Do you want me?\" she asked, low and breathlessly.\n\nWith a reluctance which suggested--but not to her--that his\ngenerosity was winning a hard-fought battle with his vanity, he\nreplied:  \"I need you.  I doubt if I'd dare, without you to back\nme up.\"\n\n\"I've got a trunk full of fairly good clothes and about a\nhundred dollars.  But I haven't got any play--or any art--or any\ntrade even.  Of course, I'll go.\" Then she hastily added, \"I'll\nnot be a drag on you.  I pay my own way.\"\n\n\"But you mustn't be suspicious in your independence,\" he warned\nher.  \"You mustn't forget that I'm older than you and more\nexperienced and that it's far easier for a man to get money than\nfor a woman.\"\n\n\"To get it without lowering himself?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he exclaimed, looking strangely at her.  \"You mean, without\nbowing to some boss?  Without selling his soul?  I had no idea you\nwere so much of a woman when I met you that day.\"\n\n\"I wasn't--then,\" replied she.  \"And I didn't know where I'd got\ntill we began to talk this evening.\"\n\n\"And you're very young!\"\n\n\"Oh, but I've been going to a school where they make you learn fast.\"\n\n\"Indeed I do need you.\" He touched his glass to hers.  \"On to\nBroadway!\" he cried.\n\n\"Broadway!\" echoed she, radiant.\n\n\"Together--eh?\"\n\nShe nodded.  But as she drank the toast a tear splashed into her\nglass.  She was remembering how some mysterious instinct had\nrestrained her from going with John Redmond, though it seemed\nthe only sane thing to do.  What if she had disobeyed that\ninstinct!  And then--through her mind in swift ghostly march--past\ntrailed the persons and events of the days just gone--just gone,\nyet seeming as far away as a former life in another world.\nRedmond and Gulick--Etta--yes, Etta, too--all past and\ngone--forever gone----\n\n\"What are you thinking about?\"\n\nShe shook her head and the spectral procession vanished into the\nglooms of memory's vistas.  \"Thinking?--of yesterday.  I don't\nunderstand myself--how I shake off and forget what's past.\nNothing seems real to me but the future.\"\n\n\"Not even the present?\" said he with a smile.\n\n\"Not even the present,\" she answered with grave candor.  \"Nothing\nseems to touch me--the real me.  It's like--like looking out of\nthe window of the train at the landscape running by.  I'm a\ntraveler passing through.  I wonder if it'll always be that way.\nI wonder if I'll ever arrive where I'll feel that I belong.\"\n\n\"I think so--and soon.\"\n\nBut she did not respond to his confident smile.  \"I--I hope so,\"\nshe said with sad, wistful sweetness.  \"Then again--aren't there\nsome people who don't belong anywhere--aren't allowed to settle\ndown and be happy, but have to keep going--on and on--until----\"\n\n\"Until they pass out into the dark,\" he finished for her.  \"Yes.\"\nHe looked at her in a wondering uneasy way.  \"You do suggest that\nkind,\" said he.  \"But,\" smilingly, to hide his earnestness, \"I'll\ntry to detain you.\"\n\n\"Please do,\" she said.  \"I don't want to go on--alone.\"\n\nHe dropped into silence, puzzled and in a way awed by the\nmystery enveloping her--a mystery of aloofness and stoniness, of\ncomplete separation from the contact of the world--the mystery\nthat incloses all whose real life is lived deep within themselves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nLIKE days later, on the Eastern Express, they were not so\nconfident as they had been over the St. Nicholas champagne.  As\nconfident about the remoter future, it was that annoying little\nstretch near at hand which gave them secret uneasiness.  There\nhad been nothing but dreaming and sentimentalizing in those four\ndays--and that disquietingly suggested the soldier who with an\nimpressive flourish highly resolves to give battle, then\nsheathes his sword and goes away to a revel.  Also, like all\nidlers, they had spent money--far more money than total net cash\nresources of less than five hundred dollars warranted.\n\n\"We've spent an awful lot of money,\" said Susan.\n\nShe was quick to see the faint frown, the warning that she was\non dangerous ground.  Said he:\n\n\"Do you regret?\"\n\n\"No, indeed--no!\" cried she, eager to have that cloud vanish,\nbut honest too.\n\nShe no more than he regretted a single moment of the dreaming\nand love-making, a single penny of the eighty and odd dollars\nthat had enabled them fittingly to embower their romance, to\ntwine myrtle in their hair and to provide Cupid's torch-bowls\nwith fragrant incense.  Still--with the battle not begun, there\ngaped that deep, wide hollow in the war chest.\n\nSpenser's newspaper connection got them passes over one of the\ncheaper lines to New York--and he tried to console himself by\nsetting this down as a saving of forty dollars against the\neighty dollars of the debit item.  But he couldn't altogether\nforget that they would have traveled on passes, anyhow.  He was\nnot regretting that he had indulged in the extravagance of a\nstateroom--but he couldn't deny that it was an extravagance.\nHowever, he had only to look at her to feel that he had done\naltogether well in providing for her the best, and to believe\nthat he could face with courage any fate so long as he had her\nat his side.\n\n\"Yes, I can face anything with you,\" he said.  \"What I feel for\nyou is the real thing.  The real thing, at last.\"\n\nShe had no disposition to inquire curiously into this.  Her reply\nwas a flash of a smile that was like a flash of glorious light\nupon the crest of a wave surging straight from her happy heart.\n\nThey were opposite each other at breakfast in the restaurant\ncar.  He delighted in her frank delight in the novelty of\ntravel--swift and luxurious travel.  He had never been East\nbefore, himself, but he had had experience of sleepers and\ndiners; she had not, and every moment she was getting some new\nsensation.  She especially enjoyed this sitting at breakfast\nwith the express train rushing smoothly along through the\nmountains--the first mountains either had seen.  At times they\nwere so intensely happy that they laughed with tears in their\neyes and touched hands across the table to get from physical\ncontact the reassurances of reality.\n\n\"How good to eat everything is!\" she exclaimed.  \"You'll think me\nvery greedy, I'm afraid.  But if you'd eaten the stuff I have\nsince we dined on the rock!\"\n\nThey were always going back to the rock, and neither wearied of\nrecalling and reminding each other of the smallest details.  It\nseemed to them that everything, even the least happening, at\nthat sacred spot must be remembered, must be recorded indelibly\nin the book of their romance.  \"I'm glad we were happy together in\nsuch circumstances,\" she went on.  \"It was a test--wasn't it, Rod?\"\n\n\"If two people don't love each other enough to be happy\nanywhere, they could be happy nowhere,\" declared he.\n\n\"So, we'll not mind being very, very careful about spending\nmoney in New York,\" she ventured--for she was again bringing up\nthe subject she had been privately revolving ever since they had\nformed the partnership.  In her wanderings with Burlingham, in\nher sojourn in the tenements, she had learned a great deal about\nthe care and spending of money--had developed that instinct for\nforehandedness which nature has implanted in all normal women\nalong with the maternal instinct--and as a necessary supplement\nto it.  This instinct is more or less futile in most women\nbecause they are more or less ignorant of the realities as to wise\nand foolish expenditure.  But it is found in the most extravagant\nwomen no less than in the most absurdly and meanly stingy.\n\n\"Of course, we must be careful,\" assented Rod.  \"But I can't let\nyou be uncomfortable.\"\n\n\"Now, dear,\" she remonstrated, \"you mustn't treat me that way.\nI'm better fitted for hardship than you.  I'd mind it less.\"\n\nHe laughed; she looked so fine and delicate, with her\ntransparent skin and her curves of figure, he felt that anything\nso nearly perfect could not but easily be spoiled.  And there he\nshowed how little he appreciated her iron strength, her almost\nexhaustless endurance.  He fancied he was the stronger because he\ncould have crushed her in his muscular arms.  But exposures,\nprivations, dissipations that would have done for a muscularly\nstronger man than he would have left no trace upon her after a\nfew days of rest and sleep.\n\n\"It's the truth,\" she insisted.  \"I could prove it, but I shan't.\nI don't want to remember vividly.  Rod, we _must_ live cheaply in\nNew York until you sell a play and I have a place in some company.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he conceded.  \"But, Susie, not too cheap.  A cheap way of\nliving makes a cheap man--gives a man a cheap outlook on life.\nBesides, don't forget--if the worst comes to the worst, I can\nalways get a job on a newspaper.\"\n\nShe would not have let him see how uneasy this remark made her.\nHowever, she could not permit it to pass without notice.  Said\nshe a little nervously:\n\n\"But you've made up your mind to devote yourself to plays--to\nstand or fall by that.\"\n\nHe remembered how he had thrilled her and himself with brave\ntalk about the necessity of concentrating, of selecting a goal\nand moving relentlessly for it, letting nothing halt him or turn\nhim aside.  For his years Rod Spenser was as wise in the\nphilosophy of success as Burlingham or Tom Brashear.  But he had\ndone that brave and wise talking before he loved her as he now\ndid--before he realized how love can be in itself an achievement\nand a possession so great that other ambitions dwarf beside it.\nTrue, away back in his facile, fickle mind, behind the region\nwhere self-excuse and somebody-else-always-to-blame reigned\nsupreme, a something--the something that had set the marks of\nsuccess so strongly upon his face--was whispering to him the\nreal reason for his now revolving a New York newspaper job.  Real\nreasons as distinguished from alleged reasons and imagined\nreasons, from the reasons self-deception invents and vanity\ngives out--real reasons are always interesting and worth noting.\nWhat was Rod's?  Not his love for her; nothing so superior, so\nsuperhuman as that.  No, it was weak and wobbly misgivings as to\nhis own ability to get on independently, the misgivings that\nmenace every man who has never worked for himself but has always\ndrawn pay--the misgivings that paralyze most men and keep them\nwage or salary slaves all their lives.  Rod was no better pleased\nat this sly, unwelcome revelation of his real self to himself\nthan the next human being is in similar circumstances.  The\nwhispering was hastily suppressed; love for her, desire that she\nshould be comfortable--those must be the real reasons.  But he\nmust be careful lest she, the sensitive, should begin to brood\nover a fear that she was already weakening him and would become\na drag upon him--the fear that, he knew, would take shape in his\nown mind if things began to go badly.  \"You may be sure,\ndearest,\" he said, \"I'll do nothing that won't help me on.\" He\ntapped his forehead with his finger.  \"This is a machine for\nmaking plays.  Everything that's put into it will be grist for it.\"\n\nShe was impressed but not convinced.  He had made his point about\nconcentration too clear to her intelligence.  She persisted:\n\n\"But you said if you took a place on a newspaper it would make\nyou fight less hard.\"\n\n\"I say a lot of things,\" he interrupted laughingly.  \"Don't be\nfrightened about me.  What I'm most afraid of is that you'll\ndesert me.  _That_ would be a real knock-out blow.\"\n\nHe said this smilingly; but she could not bear jokes on that one\nsubject.\n\n\"What do you mean, Rod?\"\n\n\"Now, don't look so funereal, Susie.  I simply meant that I hate\nto think of your going on the stage--or at anything else.  I want\nyou to help _me_.  Selfish, isn't it?  But, dear heart, if I could\nfeel that the plays were _ours_, that we were both concentrated\non the one career--darling.  To love each other, to work\ntogether--not separately but together--don't you understand?\"\n\nHer expression showed that she understood, but was not at all in\nsympathy.  \"I've got to earn my living, Rod,\" she objected.  \"I\nshan't care anything about what I'll be doing.  I'll do it simply\nto keep from being a burden to you----\"\n\n\"A burden, Susie!  You!  Why, you're my wings that enable me to\nfly.  It's selfish, but I want all of you.  Don't you think, dear,\nthat if it were possible, it would be better for you to make us\na home and hold the fort while I go out to give battle to\nmanagers--and bind up my wounds when I come back--and send me out\nthe next day well again?  Don't you think we ought to concentrate?\"\n\nThe picture appealed to her.  All she wanted in life now was his\nsuccess.  \"But,\" she objected, \"it's useless to talk of that\nuntil we get on our feet--perfectly useless.\"\n\n\"It's true,\" he admitted with a sigh.\n\n\"And until we do, we must be economical.\"\n\n\"What a persistent lady it is,\" laughed he.  \"I wish I were like that.\"\n\nIn the evening's gathering dusk the train steamed into Jersey\nCity; and Spenser and Susan Lenox, with the adventurer's\nmingling hope and dread, confidence and doubt, courage and fear,\nfollowed the crowd down the long platform under the vast train\nshed, went through the huge thronged waiting-room and aboard the\ngiant ferryboat which filled both with astonishment because of\nits size and luxuriousness.\n\n\"I am a jay!\" said she.  \"I can hardly keep my mouth from\ndropping open.\"\n\n\"You haven't any the advantage of me,\" he assured her.  \"Are you\ntrembling all over?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she admitted.  \"And my heart's like lead.  I suppose there\nare thousands on thousands like us, from all over the\ncountry--who come here every day--feeling as we do.\"\n\n\"Let's go out on the front deck--where we can see it.\"\n\nThey went out on the upper front deck and, leaning against the\nforward gates, with their traveling bags at their feet, they\nstood dumb before the most astounding and most splendid scene in\nthe civilized world.  It was not quite dark yet; the air was\nalmost July hot, as one of those prematurely warm days New York\nso often has in March.  The sky, a soft and delicate blue shading\ninto opal and crimson behind them, displayed a bright crescent\nmoon as it arched over the fairyland in the dusk before them.\nStraight ahead, across the broad, swift, sparkling river--the\nbroadest water Susan had ever seen--rose the mighty, the\nmajestic city.  It rose direct from the water.  Endless stretches\nof ethereal-looking structure, reaching higher and higher, in\nmasses like mountain ranges, in peaks, in towers and domes.  And\nmillions of lights, like fairy lamps, like resplendent jewels,\ngave the city a glory beyond that of the stars thronging the\nheavens on a clear summer night.\n\nThey looked toward the north; on and on, to the far horizon's\nedge stretched the broad river and the lovely city that seemed\nthe newborn offspring of the waves; on and on, the myriad\nlights, in masses, in festoons, in great gleaming globes of fire\nfrom towers rising higher than Susan's and Rod's native hills.\nThey looked to the south.  There, too, rose city, mile after\nmile, and then beyond it the expanse of the bay; and everywhere\nthe lights, the beautiful, soft, starlike lights, shedding a\nradiance as of heaven itself over the whole scene.  Majesty and\nstrength and beauty.\n\n\"I love it!\" murmured the girl.  \"Already I love it.\"\n\n\"I never dreamed it was like this,\" said Roderick, in an awed tone.\n\n\"The City of the Stars,\" said she, in the caressing tone in\nwhich a lover speaks the name of the beloved.\n\nThey moved closer together and clasped hands and gazed as if\nthey feared the whole thing--river and magic city and their own\nselves--would fade away and vanish forever.  Susan clutched Rod\nin terror as she saw the vision suddenly begin to move, to\nadvance toward her, like apparitions in a dream before they\nvanish.  Then she exclaimed, \"Why, we are moving!\" The big\nferryboat, swift, steady as land, noiseless, had got under way.\nUpon them from the direction of the distant and hidden sea blew\na cool, fresh breeze.  Never before had either smelled that\nperfume, strong and keen and clean, which comes straight from\nthe unbreathed air of the ocean to bathe New York, to put life\nand hope and health into its people.  Rod and Susan turned their\nfaces southward toward this breeze, drank in great draughts of\nit.  They saw a colossal statue, vivid as life in the dusk, in\nthe hand at the end of the high-flung arm a torch which sent a\nblaze of light streaming out over land and water.\n\n\"That must be Liberty,\" said Roderick.\n\nSusan slipped her arm through his.  She was quivering with\nexcitement and joy.  \"Rod--Rod!\" she murmured.  \"It's the isles of\nfreedom.  Kiss me.\"\n\nAnd he bent and kissed her, and his cheek felt the tears upon\nhers.  He reached for her hand, with an instinct to strengthen\nher.  But when he had it within his its firm and vital grasp sent\na thrill of strength through him.\n\nA few minutes, and they paused at the exit from the ferry house.\nThey almost shrank back, so dazed and helpless did they feel\nbefore the staggering billows of noise that swept savagely down\nupon them--roar and crash, shriek and snort; the air was\nshuddering with it, the ground quaking.  The beauty had\nvanished--the beauty that was not the city but a glamour to lure\nthem into the city's grasp; now that city stood revealed as a\nmonster about to seize and devour them.\n\n\"God!\" He shouted in her ear.  \"Isn't this _frightful!_\"\n\nShe was recovering more quickly than he.  The faces she saw\nreassured her.  They were human faces; and while they were eager\nand restless, as if the souls behind them sought that which\nnever could be found, they were sane and kind faces, too.  Where\nothers of her own race lived, and lived without fear, she, too,\ncould hope to survive.  And already she, who had loved this\nmighty offspring of the sea and the sky at first glance, saw and\nfelt another magic--the magic of the peopled solitude.  In this\nvast, this endless solitude she and he would be free.  They could\ndo as they pleased, live as they pleased, without thought of the\nopinion of others.  Here she could forget the bestial horrors of\nmarriage; here she would fear no scornful pointing at her\nbirth-brand of shame.  She and Rod could be poor without shame;\nthey could make their fight in the grateful darkness of obscurity.\n\n\"Scared?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not a bit,\" was her prompt answer.  \"I love it more than ever.\"\n\n\"Well, it frightens me a little.  I feel helpless--lost in the\nnoise and the crowd.  How can I do anything here!\"\n\n\"Others have.  Others do.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes!  That's so.  We must take hold!\" And he selected a\ncabman from the shouting swarm.  \"We want to go, with two trunks,\nto the Hotel St. Denis,\" said he.\n\n\"All right, sir!  Gimme the checks, please.\"\n\nSpenser was about to hand them over when Susan said in an\nundertone, \"You haven't asked the price.\"\n\nSpenser hastened to repair this important omission.  \"Ten\ndollars,\" replied the cabman as if ten dollars were some such\ntrifle as ten cents.\n\nSpenser laughed at the first experience of the famous New York\nhabit of talking in a faint careless way of large sums of\nmoney--other people's money.  \"You did save us a swat,\" he said\nto Susan, and beckoned another man.  The upshot of a long and\narduous discussion, noisy and profane, was that they got the\ncarriage for six dollars--a price which the policeman who had\nbeen drawn into the discussion vouched for as reasonable.\nSpenser knew it was too high, knew the policeman would get a\ndollar or so of the profit, but he was weary of the wrangle; and\nhe would not listen to Susan's suggestion that they have the\ntrunks sent by the express company and themselves go in a street\ncar for ten cents.  At the hotel they got a large comfortable\nroom and a bath for four dollars a day.  Spenser insisted it was\ncheap; Susan showed her alarm--less than an hour in New York and\nten dollars gone, not to speak of she did not know how much\nchange.  For Roderick had been scattering tips with what is for\nsome mysterious reason called \"a princely hand,\" though princes\nknow too well the value of money and have too many extravagant\ntastes ever to go far in sheer throwing away.\n\nThey had dinner in the restaurant of the hotel and set out to\nexplore the land they purposed to subdue and to possess.  They\nwalked up Broadway to Fourteenth, missed their way in the dazzle\nand glare of south Union Square, discovered the wandering\nhighway again after some searching.  After the long, rather quiet\nstretch between Union Square and Thirty-fourth Street they found\nthemselves at the very heart of the city's night life.  They\ngazed in wonder upon the elevated road with its trains\nthundering by high above them.  They crossed Greeley Square and\nstood entranced before the spectacle--a street bright as day\nwith electric signs of every color, shape and size; sidewalks\njammed with people, most of them dressed with as much pretense\nto fashion as the few best in Cincinnati; one theater after\nanother, and at Forty-second Street theaters in every direction.\nSurely--surely--there would be small difficulty in placing his\nplay when there were so many theaters, all eager for plays.\n\nThey debated going to the theater, decided against it, as they\nwere tired from the journey and the excitement of crowding new\nsensations.  \"I've never been to a real theater in my life,\" said\nSusan.  \"I want to be fresh the first time I go.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried Rod.  \"That's right.  Tomorrow night.  That _will_ be\nan experience!\" And they read the illuminated signs, inspected\nthe show windows, and slowly strolled back toward the hotel.  As\nthey were recrossing Union Square, Spenser said, \"Have you\nnoticed how many street girls there are?  We must have passed a\nthousand.  Isn't it frightful?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan.\n\nRod made a gesture of disgust, and said with feeling, \"How low\na woman must have sunk before she could take to that life!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan.\n\n\"So low that there couldn't possibly be left any shred of\nfeeling or decency anywhere in her.\" Susan did not reply.\n\n\"It's not a question of morals, but of sensibility,\" pursued he.\n\"Some day I'm going to write a play or a story about it.  A woman\nwith anything to her, who had to choose between that life and\ndeath, wouldn't hesitate an instant.  She couldn't.  A\nstreetwalker!\" And again he made that gesture of disgust.\n\n\"Before you write,\" said Susan, in a queer, quiet voice, \"you'll\nfind out all about it.  Maybe some of these girls--most of\nthem--all of them--are still human beings.  It's not fair to\njudge people unless you know.  And it's so easy to say that\nsomeone else ought to die rather than do this or that.\"\n\n\"You can't imagine yourself doing such a thing,\" urged he.\n\nSusan hesitated, then--\"Yes,\" she said.\n\nHer tone irritated him.  \"Oh, nonsense!  You don't know what\nyou're talking about.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Susie!\" he exclaimed, looking reprovingly at her.\n\nShe met his eyes without flinching.  \"Yes,\" she said.  \"I have.\"\n\nHe stopped short and his expression set her bosom to heaving.\nBut her gaze was steady upon his.  \"Why did you tell me!\" he\ncried.  \"Oh, it isn't so--it can't be.  You don't mean exactly that.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" said she.\n\n\"Don't tell me!  I don't want to know.\" And he strode on, she\nkeeping beside him.\n\n\"I can't let you believe me different from what I am,\" replied\nshe.  \"Not you.  I supposed you guessed.\"\n\n\"Now I'll always think of it--whenever I look at you. . . .  I\nsimply can't believe it. . . .  You spoke of it as if you\nweren't ashamed.\"\n\n\"I'm not ashamed,\" she said.  \"Not before you.  There isn't\nanything I've done that I wouldn't be willing to have you know.\nI'd have told you, except that I didn't want to recall it.  You\nknow that nobody can live without getting dirty.  The thing is to\nwant to be clean--and to try to get clean afterward--isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he admitted, as if he had not been hearing.  \"I wish you\nhadn't told me.  I'll always see it and feel it when I look at you.\"\n\n\"I want you to,\" said she.  \"I couldn't love you as I do if I\nhadn't gone through a great deal.\"\n\n\"But it must have left its stains upon you,\" said he.  Again he\nstopped short in the street, faced her at the curb, with the\ncrowd hurrying by and jostling them.  \"Tell me about it!\" he\ncommanded.\n\nShe shook her head.  \"I couldn't.\" To have told would have been\nlike tearing open closed and healed wounds.  Also it would have\nseemed whining--and she had utter contempt for whining.  \"I'll\nanswer any question, but I can't just go on and tell.\"\n\n\"You deliberately went and did--that?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Haven't you any excuse, any defense?\"\n\nShe might have told him about Burlingham dying and the need of\nmoney to save him.  She might have told him about Etta--her\nhealth going--her mind made up to take to the streets, with no\none to look after her.  She might have made it all a moving and\na true tale--of self-sacrifice for the two people who had done\nmost for her.  But it was not in her simple honest nature to try\nto shift blame.  So all she said was:\n\n\"No, Rod.\"\n\n\"And you didn't want to kill yourself first?\"\n\n\"No.  I wanted to live.  I was dirty--and I wanted to be clean.  I\nwas hungry--and I wanted food.  I was cold--that was the worst.\nI was cold, and I wanted to get warm.  And--I had been\nmarried--but I couldn't tell even you about that--except--after\na woman's been through what I went through then, nothing in life\nhas any real terror or horror for her.\"\n\nHe looked at her long.  \"I don't understand,\" he finally said.\n\"Come on.  Let's go back to the hotel.\"\n\nShe walked beside him, making no attempt to break his gloomy\nsilence.  They went up to their room and she sat on the lounge by\nthe window.  He lit a cigarette and half sat, half lay, upon the\nbed.  After a long time he said with a bitter laugh, \"And I was\nso sure you were a good woman!\"\n\n\"I don't feel bad,\" she ventured timidly.  \"Am I?\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me,\" he cried, sitting up, \"that you don't\nthink anything of those things?\"\n\n\"Life can be so hard and cruel, can make one do so many----\"\n\n\"But don't you realize that what you've done is the very worst\nthing a woman can do?\"\n\n\"No,\" said she.  \"I don't. . . .  I'm sorry you didn't understand.\nI thought you did--not the details, but in a general sort of\nway.  I didn't mean to deceive you.  That would have seemed to me\nmuch worse than anything I did.\"\n\n\"I might have known!  I might have known!\" he cried--rather\ntheatrically, though sincerely withal--for Mr. Spenser was a\ndiligent worker with the tools of the play-making trade.  \"I\nlearned who you were as soon as I got home the night I left you\nin Carrolton.  They had been telephoning about you to the\nvillage.  So I knew about you.\"\n\n\"About my mother?\" asked she.  \"Is that what you mean?\"\n\n\"Oh, you need not look so ashamed,\" said he, graciously, pityingly.\n\n\"I am not ashamed,\" said she.  But she did not tell him that her\nlook came from an awful fear that he was about to make her\nashamed of him.\n\n\"No, I suppose you aren't,\" he went on, incensed by this further\nevidence of her lack of a good woman's instincts.  \"I really\nought not to blame you.  You were born wrong--born with the moral\nsense left out.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose so,\" said she, wearily.\n\n\"If only you had lied to me--told me the one lie!\" cried he.\n\"Then you wouldn't have destroyed my illusion.  You wouldn't have\nkilled my love.\"\n\nShe grew deathly white; that was all.\n\n\"I don't mean that I don't love you still,\" he hurried on.  \"But\nnot in the same way.  That's killed forever.\"\n\n\"Are there different ways of loving?\" she asked.\n\"How can I give you the love of respect and trust--now?\"\n\n\"Don't you trust me--any more?\"\n\n\"I couldn't.  I simply couldn't.  It was hard enough before on\naccount of your birth.  But now---- Trust a woman who had been\na--a--I can't speak the word.  Trust you?  You don't understand\na man.\"\n\n\"No, I don't.\" She looked round drearily.  Everything in ruins.\nAlone again.  Outcast.  Nowhere to go but the streets--the life\nthat seemed the only one for such as she.  \"I don't understand\npeople at all. . . .  Do you want me to go?\"\n\nShe had risen as she asked this.  He was beside her instantly.\n\"Go!\" he cried.  \"Why I couldn't get along without you.\"\n\n\"Then you love me as I love you,\" Said she, putting her arms\nround him.  \"And that's all I want.  I don't want what you call\nrespect.  I couldn't ever have hoped to get that, being born as\nI was--could I?  Anyhow, it doesn't seem to me to amount to much.\nI can't help it, Rod--that's the way I feel.  So just love me--do\nwith me whatever you will, so long as it makes you happy.  And I\ndon't need to be trusted.  I couldn't think of anybody but you.\"\n\nHe felt sure of her again, reascended to the peak of the moral\nmountain.  \"You understand, we can never get married.  We can\nnever have any children.\"\n\n\"I don't mind.  I didn't expect that.  We can _love_--can't we?\"\n\nHe took her face between his hands.  \"What an exquisite face it\nis,\" he said, \"soft and smooth!  And what clear, honest eyes!\nWhere is _it?_ Where _is_ it?  It _must_ be there!\"\n\n\"What, Rod?\"\n\n\"The--the dirt.\"\n\nShe did not wince, but there came into her young face a deeper\npathos--and a wan, deprecating, pleading smile.  She said:\n\n\"Maybe love has washed it away--if it was there.  It never seemed\nto touch me--any more than the dirt when I had to clean up my room.\"\n\n\"You mustn't talk that way.  Why you are perfectly calm!  You\ndon't cry or feel repentant.  You don't seem to care.\"\n\n\"It's so--so past--and dead.  I feel as if it were another\nperson.  And it was, Rod!\"\n\nHe shook his head, frowning.  \"Let's not talk about it,\" he said\nharshly.  \"If only I could stop thinking about it!\"\n\nShe effaced herself as far as she could, living in the same room\nwith him.  She avoided the least show of the tenderness she felt,\nof the longing to have her wounds soothed.  She lay awake the\nwhole night, suffering, now and then timidly and softly\ncaressing him when she was sure that he slept.  In the morning\nshe pretended to be asleep, let him call her twice before she\nshowed that she was awake.  A furtive glance at him confirmed the\nimpression his voice had given.  Behind her pale, unrevealing\nface there was the agonized throb of an aching heart, but she\nhad the confidence of her honest, utter love; he would surely\nsoften, would surely forgive.  As for herself--she had, through\nloving and feeling that she was loved, almost lost the sense of\nthe unreality of past and present that made her feel quite\ndetached and apart from the life she was leading, from the\nevents in which she was taking part, from the persons most\nintimately associated with her.  Now that sense of isolation, of\nthe mere spectator or the traveler gazing from the windows of\nthe hurrying train--that sense returned.  But she fought against\nthe feeling it gave her.\n\nThat evening they went to the theater--to see Modjeska in \"Magda.\"\n\nSusan had never been in a real theater.  The only approach to a\nplayhouse in Sutherland was Masonic Hall.  It had a sort of stage\nat one end where from time to time wandering players gave poor\nperformances of poor plays or a minstrel show or a low\nvaudeville.  But none of the best people of Sutherland went--at\nleast, none of the women.  The notion was strong in Sutherland\nthat the theater was of the Devil--not so strong as in the days\nbefore they began to tolerate amateur theatricals, but still\nvigorous enough to give Susan now, as she sat in the big,\nbrilliant auditorium, a pleasing sense that she, an outcast, was\nat last comfortably at home.  Usually the first sight of anything\none has dreamed about is pitifully disappointing.  Neither nature\nnor life can build so splendidly as a vivid fancy.  But Susan, in\nsome sort prepared for the shortcomings of the stage, was not\ndisappointed.  From rise to fall of curtain she was so\nfascinated, so absolutely absorbed, that she quite forgot her\nsurroundings, even Rod.  And between the acts she could not talk\nfor thinking.  Rod, deceived by her silence, was chagrined.  He\nhad been looking forward to a great happiness for himself in\nseeing her happy, and much profit from the study of the\nviewpoint of an absolutely fresh mind.  It wasn't until they were\nleaving the theater that he got an inkling of the true state of\naffairs with her.\n\n\"Let's go to supper,\" said he.\n\n\"If you don't mind,\" replied she, \"I'd rather go home.  I'm very tired.\"\n\n\"You were sound asleep this morning.  So you must have slept\nwell,\" said he sarcastically.\n\n\"It's the play,\" said she.\n\n\"_Why_ didn't you like it?\" he asked, irritated.\n\nShe looked at him in wonder.  \"Like what?  The play?\" She drew a\nlong breath.  \"I feel as if it had almost killed me.\"\n\nHe understood when they were in their room and she could hardly\nundress before falling into a sleep so relaxed, so profound,\nthat it made him a little uneasy.  It seemed to him the\nexhaustion of a child worn out with the excitement of a\nspectacle.  And her failure to go into ecstasies the next day led\nhim further into the same error.  \"Modjeska is very good as\n_Magda_,\" said he, carelessly, as one talking without expecting\nto be understood.  \"But they say there's an Italian\nwoman--Duse--who is the real thing.\"\n\nModjeska--Duse--Susan seemed indeed not to understand.  \"I hated\nher father,\" she said.  \"He didn't deserve to have such a\nwonderful daughter.\"\n\nSpenser had begun to laugh with her first sentence.  At the\nsecond he frowned, said bitterly:  \"I might have known!  You get\nit all wrong.  I suppose you sympathize with _Magda_?\"\n\n\"I worshiped her,\" said Susan, her voice low and tremulous with\nthe intensity of her feeling.\n\nRoderick laughed bitterly.  \"Naturally,\" he said.  \"You can't\nunderstand.\"\n\nAn obvious case, thought he.  She was indeed one of those\ninstances of absolute lack of moral sense.  Just as some people\nhave the misfortune to be born without arms or without legs, so\nothers are doomed to live bereft of a moral sense.  A sweet\ndisposition, a beautiful body, but no soul; not a stained soul,\nbut no soul at all.  And his whole mental attitude toward her\nchanged; or, rather, it was changed by the iron compulsion of\nhis prejudice.  The only change in his physical attitude--that is,\nin his treatment of her--was in the direction of bolder passion.\nof complete casting aside of all the restraint a conventional\nrespecter of conventional womanhood feels toward a woman whom he\nrespects.  So, naturally, Susan, eager to love and to be loved,\nand easily confusing the not easily distinguished spiritual and\nphysical, was reassured.  Once in a while a look or a phrase from\nhim gave her vague uneasiness; but on the whole she felt that,\nin addition to clear conscience from straightforwardness, she\nhad a further reason for being glad Chance had forced upon her\nthe alternative of telling him or lying.  She did not inquire\ninto the realities beneath the surface of their life--neither\ninto what he thought of her, nor into what she thought of\nhim--thought in the bottom of her heart.  She continued to fight\nagainst, to ignore, her feeling of aloneness, her feeling of\nimpending departure.\n\nShe was aided in this by her anxiety about their finances.  In\nhis efforts to place his play he was spending what were for them\nlarge sums of money--treating this man and that to dinners, to\nsuppers--inviting men to lunch with him at expensive Broadway\nrestaurants.  She assumed that all this was necessary; he said\nso, and he must know.  He was equally open-handed when they were\nalone, insisting on ordering the more expensive dishes, on\nhaving suppers they really did not need and drink which she knew\nshe would be better off without--and, she suspected, he also.  It\nsimply was not in him, she saw, to be careful about money.  She\nliked it, as a trait, for to her as to all the young and the\nunthinking carelessness about money seems a sure, perhaps the\nsurest, sign of generosity--when in fact the two qualities are\nin no way related.  Character is not a collection of ignorant\nimpulses but a solidly woven fabric of deliberate purposes.\nCarelessness about anything most often indicates a tendency to\ncarelessness about everything.  She admired his openhanded way of\nscattering; she wouldn't have admired it in herself, would have\nthought it dishonest and selfish.  But Rod was different.  _He_ had\nthe \"artistic temperament,\" while she was a commonplace nobody,\nwho ought to be--and was--grateful to him for allowing her to\nstay on and for making such use of her as he saw fit.  Still,\neven as she admired, she saw danger, grave danger, a\ndisturbingly short distance ahead.  He described to her the\ndifficulties he was having in getting to managers, in having his\nplay read, and the absurdity of the reasons given for turning it\ndown.  He made light of all these; the next manager would see,\nwould give him a big advance, would put the play on--and then,\nEasy Street!\n\nBut experience had already killed what little optimism there was\nin her temperament--and there had not been much, because George\nWarham was a successful man in his line, and successful men do\nnot create or permit optimistic atmosphere even in their houses.\nNor had she forgotten Burlingham's lectures on the subject with\nillustrations from his own spoiled career; she understood it all\nnow--and everything else he had given her to store up in her\nmemory that retained everything.  With that philippic against\noptimism in mind, she felt what Spenser was rushing toward.  She\nmade such inquiries about work for herself as her inexperience\nand limited opportunities permitted.  She asked, she begged him,\nto let her try to get a place.  He angrily ordered her to put any\nsuch notion out of her head.  After a time she nerved herself\nagain to speak.  Then he frankly showed her why he was refusing.\n\n\"No,\" said he peremptorily, \"I couldn't trust you in those\ntemptations.  You must stay where I can guard you.\"\n\nA woman who had deliberately taken to the streets--why, she\nthought nothing of virtue; she would be having lovers with the\nutmost indifference; and while she was not a liar yet--\"at\nleast, I think not\"--how long would that last?  With virtue gone,\nvirtue the foundation of woman's character--the rest could no\nmore stand than a house set on sand.\n\n\"As long as you want me to love you, you've got to stay with\nme,\" he declared.  \"If you persist, I'll know you're simply\nlooking for a chance to go back to your old ways.\"\n\nAnd though she continued to think and cautiously to inquire\nabout work she said no more to him.  She spent not a penny,\ndiscouraged him from throwing money away--as much as she could\nwithout irritating him--and waited for the cataclysm.  Waited not\nin gloom and tears but as normal healthy youth awaits any\nadversity not definitely scheduled for an hour close at hand.  It\nwould be far indeed from the truth to picture Susan as ever for\nlong a melancholy figure to the eye or even wholly melancholy\nwithin.  Her intelligence and her too sympathetic heart were\ntogether a strong force for sadness in her life, as they cannot\nbut be in any life.  In this world, to understand and to\nsympathize is to be saddened.  But there was in her a force\nstronger than either or both.  She had superb health.  It made her\nbeautiful, strong body happy; and that physical happiness\nbrought her up quickly out of any depths--made her gay in spite\nof herself, caused her to enjoy even when she felt that it was\n\"almost like hard-heartedness to be happy.\" She loved the sun\nand in this city where the sun shone almost all the days,\nsparkling gloriously upon the tiny salt particles filling the\nair and making it delicious to breathe and upon the skin--in\nthis City of the Sun as she called it, she was gay even when she\nwas heavy-hearted.\n\nThus, she was no repellent, aggravating companion to Rod as she\nawaited the cataclysm.\n\n\nIt came in the third week.  He spent the entire day away from her,\ntoward midnight he returned, flushed with liquor.  She had\ngone to bed.  \"Get up and dress,\" said he with an irritability\ntoward her which she had no difficulty in seeing was really\ndirected at himself.  \"I'm hungry--and thirsty.  We're going out\nfor some supper.\"\n\n\"Come kiss me first,\" said she, stretching out her arms.  Several\ntimes this device had shifted his purpose from spending money on\nthe needless and expensive suppers.\n\nHe laughed.  \"Not a kiss.  We're going to have one final blow-out.\nI start to work tomorrow.  I've taken a place on the _Herald_--on\nspace, guaranty of twenty-five a week, good chance to average\nfifty or sixty.\"\n\nHe said this hurriedly, carelessly, gayly--guiltily.  She showed\nthen and there what a surpassing wise young woman she was, for\nshe did not exclaim or remind him of his high resolve to do or\ndie as a playwright.  \"I'll be ready in a minute,\" was all she said.\n\nShe dressed swiftly, he lounging on the sofa and watching her.\nHe loved to watch her dress, she did it so gracefully, and the\nmotions brought out latent charms of her supple figure.  \"You're\nnot so sure-fingered tonight as usual,\" said he.  \"I never saw\nyou make so many blunders--and you've got one stocking on wrong\nside out.\"\n\nShe smiled into the glass at him.  \"The skirt'll cover that.  I\nguess I was sleepy.\"\n\n\"Never saw your eyes more wide-awake.  What're you thinking about?\"\n\n\"About supper,\" declared she.  \"I'm hungry.  I didn't feel like\neating alone.\"\n\n\"I can't be here always,\" said he crossly--and she knew he was\nsuspecting what she really must be thinking.\n\n\"I wasn't complaining,\" replied she sweetly.  \"You know I\nunderstand about business.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said he, with his air of generosity that always\nmade her feel grateful.  \"I always feel perfectly free about you.\"\n\n\"I should say!\" laughed she.  \"You know I don't care what happens\nso long as you succeed.\" Since their talk in Broadway that first\nevening in New York she had instinctively never said \"we.\"\n\nWhen they were at the table at Rector's and he had taken a few\nmore drinks, he became voluble and plausible on the subject of\nthe trifling importance of his setback as a playwright.  It was\nthe worst possible time of year; the managers were stocked up;\nhis play would have to be rewritten to suit some particular\nstar; a place on a newspaper, especially such an influential\npaper as the _Herald_, would be of use to him in interesting\nmanagers.  She listened and looked convinced, and strove to\nconvince herself that she believed.  But there was no gray in her\neyes, only the deepest hue of violets.\n\nNext day they took a suite of two rooms and a bath in a\npretentious old house in West Forty-fourth Street near Long Acre\nSquare.  She insisted that she preferred another much sunnier and\nquieter suite with no bath but only a stationary washstand; it\nwas to be had for ten dollars a week.  But he laughed at her as\ntoo economical in her ideas, and decided for the eighteen-dollar\nrooms.  Also he went with her to buy clothes, made her spend\nnearly a hundred dollars where she would have spent less than\ntwenty-five.  \"I prefer to make most of my things,\" declared she.\n\"And I've all the time in the world.\" He would not have it.  In\nher leisure time she must read and amuse herself and keep\nherself up to the mark, especially physically.  \"I'm proud of\nyour looks,\" said he.  \"They belong to me, don't they?  Well, take\ncare of my property, Miss.\"\n\nShe looked at him vaguely--a look of distance, of parting, of\npain.  Then she flung herself into his arms with a hysterical\ncry--and shut her eyes tight against the beckoning figure\ncalling her away.  \"No!  No!\" she murmured.  \"I belong here--_here!_\"\n\n\"What are you saying?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nothing--nothing,\" she replied.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nAT the hotel they had been Mr. and Mrs. Spenser.  When they\nmoved, he tried to devise some way round this; but it was\nnecessary that they have his address at the office, and Mrs.\nPershall with the glistening old-fashioned false teeth who kept\nthe furnished-room house was not one in whose withered bosom it\nwould be wise to raise a suspicion as to respectability.  Only in\na strenuously respectable house would he live; in the other\nsort, what might not untrustworthy Susan be up to?  So Mr. and\nMrs. Spenser they remained, and the truth was suspected by only\na few of their acquaintances, was known by two or three of his\nintimates whom he told in those bursts of confidence to which\nvoluble, careless men are given--and for which they in resolute\nself-excuse unjustly blame strong drink.\n\nOne of his favorite remarks to her--sometimes made laughingly,\nagain ironically, again angrily, again insultingly, was in this strain:\n\n\"Your face is demure enough.  But you look too damned attractive\nabout those beautiful feet of yours to be respectable at\nheart--and trustable.\"\n\nThat matter of her untrustworthiness had become a fixed idea\nwith him.  The more he concentrated upon her physical loveliness,\nthe more he revolved the dangers, the possibilities of\nunfaithfulness; for a physical infatuation is always jealous.\nHis work on the _Herald_ made close guarding out of the question.\nThe best he could do was to pop in unexpectedly upon her from\ntime to time, to rummage through her belongings, to check up her\nstatements as to her goings and comings by questioning the\nservants and, most important of all, each day to put her through\nsearching and skillfully planned cross-examination.  She had to\ntell him everything she did--every little thing--and he\ncalculated the time, to make sure she had not found half an hour\nor so in which to deceive him.  If she had sewed, he must look at\nthe sewing; if she had read, he must know how many pages and\nmust hear a summary of what those pages contained.  As she would\nnot and could not deceive him in any matter, however small, she\nwas compelled to give over a plan quietly to look for work and\nto fit herself for some occupation that would pay a living\nwage--if there were such for a beginning woman worker.\n\nAt first he was covert in this detective work, being ashamed of\nhis own suspicions.  But as he drank, as he associated again with\nthe same sort of people who had wasted his time in Cincinnati,\nhe rapidly became franker and more inquisitorial.  And she\ndreaded to see the look she knew would come into his eyes, the\ncruel tightening of his mouth, if in her confusion and eagerness\nshe should happen not instantly to satisfy the doubt behind each\nquestion.  He tormented her; he tormented himself.  She suffered\nfrom humiliation; but she suffered more because she saw how his\nsuspicions were torturing him.  And in her humility and\nhelplessness and inexperience, she felt no sense of right to\nresist, no impulse to resist.\n\nAnd she forced herself to look on his spasms of jealousy as the\noccasional storms which occur even in the best climates.  She\nreminded herself that she was secure of his love, secure in his\nlove; and in her sad mood she reproached herself for not being\ncontent when at bottom everything was all right.  After what she\nhad been through, to be sad because the man she loved loved her\ntoo well!  It was absurd, ungrateful.\n\nHe pried into every nook and corner of her being with that\ningenious and tireless persistence human beings reserve for\nsearches for what they do not wish to find.  At last he contrived\nto find, or to imagine he had found, something that justified\nhis labors and vindicated his disbelief in her.\n\nThey were walking in Fifth Avenue one afternoon, at the hour\nwhen there is the greatest press of equipages whose expensively\nand showily dressed occupants are industriously engaged in the\noccupation of imagining they are doing something when in fact\nthey are doing nothing.  What a world!  What a grotesque confusing\nof motion and progress!  What fantastic delusions that one is\nbusy when one is merely occupied!  They were between Forty-sixth\nStreet and Forty-seventh, on the west side, when a small\nvictoria drew up at the curb and a woman descended and crossed\nthe sidewalk before them to look at the display in a milliner's\nwindow.  Susan gave her the swift, seeing glance which one woman\nalways gives another--the glance of competitors at each other's\nofferings.  Instead of glancing away, Susan stopped short and\ngazed.  Forgetting Rod, she herself went up to the millinery\ndisplay that she might have a fuller view of the woman who had\nfascinated her.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" cried Spenser.  \"Come on.  You don't want any\nof those hats.\"\n\nBut Susan insisted that she must see, made him linger until the\nwoman returned to her carriage and drove away.  She said to Rod:\n\n\"Did you see her?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Rather pretty--nothing to scream about.\"\n\n\"But her _style!_\" cried Susan.\n\n\"Oh, she was nicely dressed--in a quiet way.  You'll see\nthousands a lot more exciting after you've been about in this\ntown a while.\"\n\n\"I've seen scores of beautifully dressed women here--and in\nCincinnati, too,\" replied Susan.  \"But that woman--she was\n_perfect_.  And that's a thing I've never seen before.\"\n\"I'm glad you have such quiet tastes--quiet and inexpensive.\"\n\n\"Inexpensive!\" exclaimed Susan.  \"I don't dare think how much\nthat woman's clothes cost.  You only glanced at her, Rod, you\ndidn't _look_.  If you had, you'd have seen.  Everything she wore\nwas just right.\" Susan's eyes were brilliant.  \"Oh, it was\nwonderful!  The colors--the fit--the style--the making--every big\nand little thing.  She was a work of art, Rod!  That's the first\nwoman I've seen in my life that I through and through envied.\"\n\nRod's look was interested now.  \"You like that sort of thing a\nlot?\" he inquired with affected carelessness.\n\n\"Every woman does,\" replied she, unsuspicious.  \"But I\ncare--well, not for merely fine clothes.  But for the--the kind\nthat show what sort of person is in them.\" She sighed.  \"I wonder\nif I'll ever learn--and have money enough to carry out.  It'll\ntake so much--so much!\" She laughed.  \"I've got terribly\nextravagant ideas.  But don't be alarmed--I keep them chained up.\"\n\nHe was eying her unpleasantly.  Suddenly she became confused.  He\nthought it was because she was seeing and understanding his look\nand was frightened at his having caught her at last.  In fact, it\nwas because it all at once struck her that what she had\ninnocently and carelessly said sounded like a hint or a reproach\nto him.  He sneered:\n\n\"So you're crazy about finery--eh?\"\n\n\"Oh, Rod!\" she cried.  \"You know I didn't mean it that way.  I\nlong for and dream about a whole lot of beautiful things, but\nnothing else in the world's in the same class with--with what\nwe've got.\"\n\n\"You needn't try to excuse yourself,\" said he in a tone that\nsilenced her.\n\nShe wished she had not seen the woman who had thus put a cloud\nover their afternoon's happiness.  But long after she had\nforgotten his queerness about what she said, she continued to\nremember that \"perfect\" woman--to see every detail of her\nexquisite toilet, so rare in a world where expensive-looking\nfinery is regarded as the chief factor in the art of dress.  How\nmuch she would have to learn before she could hope to dress like\nthat!--learn not merely about dress but about the whole artistic\nside of life.  For that woman had happened to cross Susan's\nvision at just the right moment--in development and in mood--to\nreveal to her clearly a world into which she had never\npenetrated--a world of which she had vaguely dreamed as she read\nnovels of life in the lands beyond the seas, the life of palaces\nand pictures and statuary, of opera and theater, of equipages\nand servants and food and clothing of rare quality.  She had\nrather thought such a life did not exist outside of novels and\ndreams.  What she had seen of New York--the profuse, the gigantic\nbut also the undiscriminating--had tended to strengthen the\nsuspicion.  But this woman proved her mistaken.\n\nOur great forward strides are made unconsciously, are the\nresults of apparently trivial, often unnoted impulses.  Susan,\nlike all our race, had always had vague secret dreams of\nambition--so vague thus far that she never thought of them as\nimpelling purposes in her life.  Her first long forward stride\ntoward changing these dreams from the vague to the definite was\nwhen Rod, before her on the horse on the way to Brooksburg,\ntalked over his shoulder to her of the stage and made her feel\nthat it was the life for her, the only life open to her where a\nwoman could hope to be judged as human being instead of as mere\ninstrument of sex.  Her second long forward movement toward\nsharply defined ambition dated from the sight of the woman of\nthe milliner's window--the woman who epitomized to Susan the\nwhole art side of life that always gives its highest expression\nin some personal achievement--the perfect toilet, the perfect\npainting or sculpture, the perfect novel or play.\n\nBut Rod saw in her enthusiasm only evidence of a concealed\nlonging for the money to indulge extravagant whims.  With his\nnarrowing interest in women--narrowed now almost to sex--his\ncontempt for them as to their minds and their hearts was so far\nadvancing that he hardly took the trouble to veil it with\nremnants of courtesy.  If Susan had clearly understood--even if\nshe had let herself understand what her increasing knowledge\nmight have enabled her to understand--she would have hated him\nin spite of the hold gratitude and habit had given him upon her\nloyal nature--and despite the fact that she had, as far as she\ncould see, no alternative to living with him but the tenements\nor the streets.\n\nOne day in midsummer she chanced to go into the Hotel Astor to\nbuy a magazine.  As she had not been there before she made a\nwrong turning and was forced to cross one of the restaurants.  In\na far corner, half hidden by a group of palms, she saw Rod at a\nsmall table with a strikingly pretty woman whose expression and\ndress and manner most energetically proclaimed the actress.  The\nwoman was leaning toward him, was touching his hand and looking\ninto his eyes with that show of enthusiasm which raises doubts\nof sincerity in an experienced man and sets him to keeping an\neye or a hand--or both--upon his money.  Real emotion, even a\nprofessional expert at display of emotion, is rarely so adept at\nexhibiting itself.\n\nIt may have been jealousy that guided her to this swift judgment\nupon the character of the emotion correctly and charmingly\nexpressing itself.  If so, jealousy was for once a trustworthy\nguide.  She turned swiftly and escaped unseen.  The idea of\ntrapping him, of confronting him, never occurred to her.  She\nfelt ashamed and self-reproachful that she had seen.  Instead of\nthe anger that fires a vain woman, whether she cares about a man\nor not, there came a profound humiliation.  She had in some way\nfallen short; she had not given him all he needed; it must be\nthat she hadn't it to give, since she had given him all she had.\nHe must not know--he must not!  For if he knew he might dislike\nher, might leave her--and she dared not think what life would be\nwithout him, her only source of companionship and affection, her\nonly means of support.  She was puzzled that her discovery, not\nof his treachery--he had so broken her spirit with his\nsuspicions and his insulting questions that she did not regard\nherself as of the rank and dignity that has the right to exact\nfidelity--but of his no longer caring enough to be content with\nher alone, had not stunned her with amazement.  She did not\nrealize how completely the instinct that he was estranged from\nher had prepared her for the thing that always accompanies\nestrangement.  Between the perfect accord, that is, the never\nrealized ideal for a man and a woman living together, and the\nintolerable discord that means complete repulse there is a vast\nrange of states of feeling imperceptibly shading into each\nother.  Most couples constantly move along this range, now toward\nthe one extreme, now toward the other.  As human kings are not\ngiven to self-analysis, and usually wander into grotesque error\nwhenever they attempt it, no couple knows precisely where it is\nupon the range, until something crucial happens to compel them\nto know.  Susan and Rod had begun as all couples begin--with an\nimaginary ideal accord based upon their ignorance of each other\nand their misunderstanding of what qualities they thought they\nunderstood in each other.  The delusion of accord vanished that\nfirst evening in New York.  What remained?  What came in the\nplace?  They knew no more about that than does the next couple.\nThey were simply \"living along.\" A crisis, drawing them close\ntogether or flinging them forever apart or forcing them to live\ntogether, he frankly as keeper and she frankly as kept, might\ncome any day, any hour.  Again it might never come.\n\nAfter a few weeks the matter that had been out of her mind\naccidentally and indirectly came to the surface in a chance\nremark.  She said:\n\n\"Sometimes I half believe a man could be untrue to a woman, even\nthough he loved her.\"\n\nShe did not appreciate the bearings of her remark until it was\nspoken.  With a sensation of terror lest the dreaded crisis might\nbe about to burst, she felt his quick, nervous glance.  She\nbreathed freely again when she felt his reassurance and relief\nas she successfully withstood.\n\n\"Certainly,\" he said with elaborate carelessness.  \"Men are a\nrotten, promiscuous lot.  That's why it's necessary for a woman\nto be good and straight.\"\n\nAll this time his cross-examination had grown in severity.\nEvidently he was fearing that she might be having a recurrence\nof the moral disease which was fatal in womankind, though only\nmild indiscretion in a man, if not positively a virtue, an\nevidence of possessing a normal masculine nature.  Her mind began\ncuriously--sadly--to revolve the occasional presents--of money,\nof books, of things to wear--which he gave, always quite\nunexpectedly.  At first unconsciously, but soon consciously, she\nbegan to associate these gifts, given always in an embarrassed,\nshamefaced way, with certain small but significant indications\nof his having strayed.  And it was not long before she\nunderstood; she was receiving his expiations for his\nindiscretions.  Like an honest man and a loyal--masculinely\nloyal--lover he was squaring accounts.  She never read the books\nshe owed to these twinges; it was thus that she got her aversion\nto Thackeray--one of his \"expiations\" was a set of Thackeray.\nThe things to wear she contrived never to use.  The conscience\nmoney she either spent upon him or put back into his pocket a\nlittle at a time, sure that he, the most careless of men about\nmoney, would never detect her.\n\nHis work forced him to keep irregular hours; thus she could\npretend to herself that his absences were certainly because of\noffice duty.  Still, whenever he was gone overnight, she became\nunhappy--not the crying kind of unhappiness; to that she was\nlittle given--but the kind that lies awake and aches and with\nmorbid vivid fancy paints the scenes suspicion suggests, and\nstares at them not in anger but in despair.  She was always\nurging herself to content herself with what she was getting.  She\nrecalled and lived again the things she had forgotten while\nRoderick was wholly hers--the penalties of the birth brand of\nshame--her wedding night--the miseries of the last period of her\nwanderings with Burlingham--her tenement days--the dirt, the\nnakedness, the brutal degradation, the vermin, the savage cold.\nAnd the instant he returned, no matter how low-spirited she had\nbeen, she was at once gay, often deliriously gay--until soon his\nawakened suspicion as to what she had been up to in his absence\nquieted her.  There was little forcing or pretense in this\ngayety; it bubbled and sparkled from the strong swift current of\nher healthy passionate young life which, suspended in the icy\nclutch of fear when he was away from her, flowed as freely as the\nbrooks in spring as soon as she realized that she still had him.\n\nDid she really love him?  She believed she did.  Was she right?\nLove is of many degrees--and kinds.  And strange and confused\nbeyond untangling is the mixture of motives and ideas in the\nmind of any human being as to any other being with whom his or\nher relations are many sided.\n\nAnyone who had not been roughly seized by destiny and forced to\nfight desperately weaponless might have found it difficult to\nunderstand how this intelligent, high-spirited girl could be so\nreasonable--coarsely practical, many people would have said.  A\nbrave soul--truly brave with the unconscious courage that lives\nheroically without any taint of heroics--such a soul learns to\naccept the facts of life, to make the best of things, to be\ngrateful for whatever sunshine may be and not to shriek and\ngesticulate at storm.  Suffering had given this sapling of a girl\nthe strong fiber that enables a tree to push majestically up\ntoward the open sky.  Because she did not cry out was no sign\nthat she was not hurt; and because she did not wither and die of\nher wounds was only proof of her strength of soul.  The weak wail\nand the weak succumb; the strong persist--and a world of wailers\nand weaklings calls them hard, insensible, coarse.\n\nSpenser was fond of exhibiting to his men friends--to some of\nthem--this treasure to which he always returned the more\nenamoured for his vagary and its opportunity of comparison.\nWomen he would not permit.  In general, he held that all women,\nthe respectable no less than the other kind, put mischief in\neach other's heads and egged each other on to carry out the\nmischief already there in embryo.  In particular, he would have\nfelt that he was committing a gross breach of the proprieties,\nnot to say the decencies, had he introduced a woman of Susan's\norigin, history and present status to the wives and sisters of\nhis friends; and, for reasons which it was not necessary even to\npretend to conceal from her, he forbade her having anything to\ndo with the kinds of woman who would not have minded, had they\nknown all about her.  Thus, her only acquaintances, her only\nassociates, were certain carefully selected men.  He asked to\ndinner or to the theater or to supper at Jack's or Rector's only\nsuch men as he could trust.  And trustworthy meant physically\nunattractive.  Having small and dwindling belief in the mentality\nof women, and no belief whatever in mentality as a force in the\nrelations of the sexes, he was satisfied to have about her any\nman, however clever, provided he was absolutely devoid of\nphysical charm.\n\nThe friend who came oftenest was Drumley, an editorial writer\nwho had been his chum at college and had got him the place on\nthe _Herald_.  Drumley he would have trusted alone with her on a\ndesert island; for several reasons, all of his personal\nconvenience, it pleased him that Susan liked Drumley and was\nglad of his company, no matter how often he came or how long he\nstayed.  Drumley was an emaciated Kentucky giant with grotesquely\nsloping shoulders which not all the ingenious padding of his\ntailor could appreciably mitigate.  His spare legs were bowed in\nthe calves.  His skin looked rough and tough, like sandpaper and\nemery board.  The thought of touching his face gave one the same\nsensation as a too deeply cut nail.  His neck was thin and long,\nand he wore a low collar--through that interesting passion of the\nvain for seeing a defect in themselves as a charm and calling\nattention to it.  The lower part of his sallow face suggested\nweakness--the weakness so often seen in the faces of\nprofessional men, and explaining why they chose passive instead of\nactive careers.  His forehead was really fine, but the development\nof the rest of the cranium above the protuberant little ears was\nnot altogether satisfying to a claim of mental powers.\n\nDrumley was a good sort--not so much through positive virtue as\nthrough the timidity which too often accounts for goodness, that\nis, for the meek conformity which passes as goodness.  He was an\ninsatiable reader, had incredible stores of knowledge; and as he\nhad a large vocabulary and a ready speech he could dole out of\nthose reservoirs an agreeable treacle of commonplace philosophy\nor comment--thus he had an ideal equipment for editorial\nwriting.  He was absolutely without physical magnetism.  The most\nhe could ever expect from any woman was respect; and that woman\nwould have had to be foolish enough not to realize that there is\nas abysmal a difference between knowledge and mentality as there\nis between reputation and character.  Susan liked him because he\nknew so much.  She had developed still further her innate passion\nfor educating herself.  She now wanted to know all about\neverything.  He told her what to read, set her in the way to\ndiscovering and acquiring the art of reading--an art he was\nhimself capable of acquiring only in its rudiments--an art the\nexistence of which is entirely unsuspected by most persons who\nregard themselves and are regarded as readers.  He knew the\nhistories and biographies that are most amusing and least\nshallow and mendacious.  He instructed her in the great\nplaywrights and novelists and poets, and gave--as his own--the\nreasons for their greatness assigned by the world's foremost\ncritical writers.  He showed her what scientific books to\nread--those that do not bore and do not hide the simple\nfascinating facts about the universe under pretentious,\ncollege-professor phraseology.\n\nHe was a pedant, but his pedantry was disguised, therefore\nmitigated by his having associated with men of the world instead\nof with the pale and pompous capons of the student's closet.  His\nfavorite topic was beauty and ugliness--and his abhorrence for\nanyone who was not good to look at.  As he talked this subject,\nhis hearers were nervous and embarrassed.  He was a drastic cure\nfor physical vanity.  If this man could so far deceive himself\nthat he thought himself handsome, who in all the world could be\nsure he or she was not the victim of the same incredible\ndelusion?  It was this hallucination of physical beauty that\ncaused Rod to regard him as the safest of the safe.  For it made\nhim pitiful and ridiculous.\n\nAt first he came only with Spenser.  Afterward, Spenser used to\nsend him to dine with Susan and to spend the evenings with her\nwhen he himself had to be--or wished to be elsewhere.  When she\nwas with Drumley he knew she was not \"up to any of her old\ntricks.\" Drumley fell in love with her; but, as in his\nexperience the female sex was coldly chaste, he never developed\neven the slight hope necessary to start in a man's mind the idea\nof treachery to his friend about a woman.  Whenever Drumley heard\nthat a woman other than the brazenly out and out disreputables\nwas \"loose\" or was inclined that way, he indignantly denied it\nas a libel upon the empedestaled sex.  If proofs beyond dispute\nwere furnished, he raved against the man with all the venom of\nthe unsuccessful hating the successful for their success.  He had\nbeen sought of women, of course, for he had a comfortable and\nsecure position and money put by.  But the serious women who had\nset snares for him for the sake of a home had not attracted him;\nas for the better looking and livelier women who had come\na-courting with alimony in view, they had unwisely chosen the\nmethod of approach that caused him to set them down as nothing\nbut professional loose characters.  Thus his high ideal of\nfeminine beauty and his lofty notion of his own deserts, on the\none hand, and his reverence for womanly propriety, on the other\nhand, had kept his charms and his income unshared.\n\nToward the end of Spenser's first year on the _Herald_--it was\nearly summer--he fell into a melancholy so profound and so\nprolonged that Susan became alarmed.  She was used to his having\nthose fits of the blues that are a part of the nervous, morbidly\nsensitive nature and in the unhealthfulness of an irregular and\ndissipated life recur at brief intervals.  He spent more and more\ntime with her, became as ardent as in their first days together,\nwith an added desperation of passionate clinging that touched\nher to the depths.  She had early learned to ignore his moods, to\navoid sympathy which aggravates, and to meet his blues with a\nvigorous counterirritant of liveliness.  After watching the\ncourse of this acute attack for more than a month, she decided\nthat at the first opportunity she would try to find out from\nDrumley what the cause was.  Perhaps she could cure him if she\nwere not working in the dark.\n\nOne June evening Drumley came to take her to dinner at the\nCasino in Central Park.  She hesitated.  She still liked Drumley's\nmind; but latterly he had fallen into the way of gazing\nfurtively, with a repulsive tremulousness of his loose eyelids,\nat her form and at her ankles--especially at her\nankles--especially at her ankles.  This furtive debauch gave her\na shivery sense of intrusion.  She distinctly liked the candid,\neven the not too coarse, glances of the usual man.  But not this\nshy peeping.  However, as there were books she particularly\nwished to talk about with him, she accepted.\n\nIt was an excursion of which she was fond.  They strolled along\nSeventh Avenue to the Park, entered and followed the lovely\nwalk, quiet and green and odorous, to the Mall.  They sauntered\nin the fading light up the broad Mall, with its roof of boughs\nof majestic trees, with its pale blue vistas of well-kept lawns.\nAt the steps leading to the Casino they paused to delight in the\nprofusely blooming wistaria and to gaze away northward into and\nover what seemed an endless forest with towers and cupolas of\ncastle and fortress and cathedral rising serene and graceful\nhere and there above the sea of green.  There was the sound of\ntinkling fountains, the musical chink-chink of harness chains of\nelegant equipages; on the Mall hundreds of children were playing\nfuriously, to enjoy to the uttermost the last few moments before\nbeing snatched away to bed--and the birds were in the same\nhysterical state as they got ready for their evening song.  The\nair was saturated with the fresh odors of spring and early\nsummer flowers.  Susan, walking beside the homely Drumley, was a\ncharming and stylish figure of girlish womanhood.  The year and\nthree months in New York had wrought the same transformations in\nher that are so noticeable whenever an intelligent and observant\nwoman with taste for the luxuries is dipped in the magic of city\nlife.  She had grown, was now perhaps a shade above the medium\nheight for women, looked even taller because of the slenderness\nof her arms, of her neck, of the lines of her figure.  There was\na deeper melancholy in her violet-gray eyes.  Experience had\nincreased the allure of her wide, beautifully curved mouth.\n\nThey took a table under the trees, with beds of blooming flowers\non either hand.  Drumley ordered the sort of dinner she liked,\nand a bottle of champagne and a bottle of fine burgundy to make\nhis favorite drink--champagne and burgundy, half and half.  He\nwas running to poetry that evening--Keats and Swinburne.\nFinally, after some hesitation, he produced a poem by Dowson--\"I\nran across it today.  It's the only thing of his worth while, I\nbelieve--and it's so fine that Swinburne must have been sore\nwhen he read it because he hadn't thought to write it himself.\nIts moral tone is not high, but it's so beautiful, Mrs. Susan,\nthat I'll venture to show it to you.  It comes nearer to\nexpressing what men mean by the man sort of constancy than\nanything I ever read.  Listen to this:\n\n\n  \"I cried for madder music and for stronger wine,\n  But when the feast is finished, and the lamps expire,\n  Then falls thy shadow, Cynara!--the night is thine;\n  And I am desolate and sick of an old passion,\n  Yea, hungry for the lips of my desire;\n  I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in my fashion.\"\n\n\nSusan took the paper, read the four stanzas several times,\nhanded it back to him without a word.  \"Don't you think it fine?\"\nasked he, a little uneasily--he was always uneasy with a woman\nwhen the conversation touched the relations of the sexes--uneasy\nlest he might say or might have said something to send a shiver\nthrough her delicate modesty.\n\n\"Fine,\" Susan echoed absently.  \"And true. . . .  I suppose it is\nthe best a woman can expect--to be the one he returns to.\nAnd--isn't that enough?\"\n\n\"You are very different from any woman I ever met,\" said\nDrumley.  \"Very different from what you were last\nfall--wonderfully different.  But you were different then, too.\"\n\n\"I'd have been a strange sort of person if it weren't so.  I've\nled a different life.  I've learned--because I've had to learn.\"\n\n\"You've been through a great deal--suffered a great deal for one\nof your age?\"\n\nSusan shrugged her shoulders slightly.  She had her impulses to\nconfide, but she had yet to meet the person who seriously\ntempted her to yield to them.  Not even Rod; no, least of all Rod.\n\n\"You are--happy?\"\n\n\"Happy--and more.  I'm content.\"\n\nThe reply was the truth, as she saw the truth.  Perhaps it was\nalso the absolute truth; for when a woman has the best she has\never actually possessed, and when she knows there is nowhere\nelse on earth for her, she is likely to be content.  Their\ndestiny of subordination has made philosophers of women.\n\nDrumley seemed to be debating how to disclose something he had\nin mind.  But after several glances at the sweet, delicate face\nof the girl, he gave it over.  In the subdued light from the\nshaded candles on their table, she looked more child-like than\nhe had ever seen.  Perhaps her big pale-blue hat and graceful\npale-blue summer dress had something to do with it, also.  \"How\nold are you?\" he asked abruptly.\n\n\"Nearly nineteen.\"\n\n\"I feel like saying, 'So much!'--and also 'So little!' How long\nhave you been married?\"\n\n\"Why all these questions?\" demanded she, smiling.\n\nHe colored with embarrassment.  \"I didn't mean to be\nimpertinent,\" said he.\n\n\"It isn't impertinence--is it?--to ask a woman how long she's\nbeen married.\"\n\nBut she did not go on to tell him; instead, she pretended to\nhave her attention distracted by a very old man and a very young\ngirl behaving in most lover-like fashion, the girl outdoing the\nman in enthusiastic determination to convince.  She was elegantly\nand badly dressed in new clothes--and she seemed as new to that\nkind of clothes as those particular clothes were new to her.\nAfter dinner they walked down through the Park by the way they\nhad come; it did not look like the same scene now, with the\nmoonlight upon it, with soft shadows everywhere and in every\nshadow a pair of lovers.  They had nearly reached the entrance\nwhen Drumley said:  \"Let's sit on this bench here.  I want to have\na serious talk with you.\"\n\nSusan seated herself and waited.  He lit a cigar with the\ndeliberation of one who is striving to gain time.  The bench\nhappened to be one of those that are divided by iron arms into\nindividual seats.  He sat with a compartment between them.  The\nmoonbeams struck across his profile as he turned it toward her;\nthey shone full upon her face.  He looked, hastily glanced away.\nWith a gruffness as if the evening mist had got into his throat\nhe said:\n\n\"Let's take another bench.\"\n\n\"Why?\" objected she.  \"I like this beautiful light.\"\n\nHe rose.  \"Please let me have my way.\" And he led her to a bench\nacross which a tree threw a deep shadow; as they sat there,\nneither could see the other's face except in dimmest outline.\nAfter a brief silence he began:\n\n\"You love Rod--don't you?\"\n\nShe laughed happily.\n\n\"Above everything on earth?\"\n\n\"Or in heaven.\"\n\n\"You'd do anything to have him succeed?\"\n\n\"No one could prevent his succeeding.  He's got it in him.  It's\nbound to come out.\"\n\n\"So I'd have said--until a year ago--that is, about a year ago.\"\n\nAs her face turned quickly toward him, he turned profile to her.\n\"What do you mean?\" said she, quickly, almost imperiously.\n\n\"Yes--I mean _you_,\" replied he.\n\n\"You mean you think I'm hindering him?\"\n\nWhen Drumley's voice finally came, it was funereally solemn.\n\"You are dragging him down.  You are killing his ambition.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" she protested with painful expression.\n\"If you did, you wouldn't say that.\"\n\n\"You mean because he is not true to you?\"\n\n\"Isn't he?\" said she, loyally trying to pretend surprise.  \"If\nthat's so, you've no right to tell me--you, his friend.  If it\nisn't, you----\"\n\n\"In either case I'd be beneath contempt--unless I knew that you\nknew already.  Oh, I've known a long time that you knew--ever\nsince the night you looked away when he absent-mindedly pulled a\nwoman's veil and gloves out of his pocket.  I've watched you\nsince then, and I know.\"\n\n\"You are a very dear friend, Mr. Drumley,\" said she.  \"But you\nmust not talk of him to me.\"\n\n\"I must,\" he replied.  And he hastened to make the self-fooled\nhypocrite's familiar move to the safety of duty's skirts.  \"It\nwould be a crime to keep silent.\"\n\nShe rose.  \"I can't listen.  It may be your duty to speak.  It's my\nduty to refuse to hear.\"\n\n\"He is overwhelmed with debt.  He is about to lose his position.\nIt is all because he is degraded--because he feels he is\nentangled in an intrigue with a woman he is ashamed to love--a\nwoman he has struggled in vain to put out of his heart.\"\n\nSusan, suddenly weak, had seated herself again.  From his first\nwords she had been prey to an internal struggle--her heart\nfighting against understanding things about her relations with\nRod, about his feeling toward her, which she had long been\ncontriving to hide from herself.  When Drumley began she knew\nthat the end of self-deception was at hand--if she let him\nspeak.  But the instant he had spoken, the struggle ended.  If he\nhad tried to stop she would have compelled him to go on.\n\n\"That woman is you,\" he continued in the same solemn measured\nway.  \"Rod will not marry you.  He cannot leave you.  And you are\ndragging him down.  You are young.  You don't know that passionate\nlove is a man's worst enemy.  It satisfies his ambition--why\nstruggle when one already has attained the climax of desire?  It\nsaps his strength, takes from him the energy without which\nachievement is impossible.  Passion dies poisoned of its own\nsweets.  But passionate love kills--at least, it kills the man.  If\nyou did not love him, I'd not be talking to you now.  But you do\nlove him.  So I say, you are killing him. . . .  Don't think he\nhas told me----\"\n\n\"I know he didn't,\" she interrupted curtly.  \"He does not whine.\"\n\nShe hadn't a doubt of the truth of her loyal defense.  And\nDrumley could not have raised a doubt, even if she had been\nseeing the expression of his face.  His long practice of the\nmodern editorial art of clearness and brevity and compact\nstatement had enabled him to put into those few sentences more\nthan another might have been unable to express in hours of\nexplanation and appeal.  And the ideas were not new to her.  Rod\nhad often talked them in a general way and she had thought much\nabout them.  Until now she had never seen how they applied to Rod\nand herself.  But she was seeing and feeling it now so acutely\nthat if she had tried to speak or to move she could not have\ndone so.\n\nAfter a long pause, Drumley said:  \"Do you comprehend what I mean?\"\n\nShe was silent--so it was certain that she comprehended.\n\"But you don't believe?. . .  He began to borrow money almost\nimmediately on his arrival here last summer.  He has been\nborrowing ever since--from everybody and anybody.  He owes now,\nas nearly as I can find out, upwards of three thousand dollars.\"\n\nSusan made a slight but sharp movement.\n\n\"You don't believe me?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Go on.\"\n\n\"He has it in him, I'm confident, to write plays--strong plays.\nDoes he ever write except ephemeral space stuff for the paper?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And he never will so long as he has you to go home to.  He lives\nbeyond his means because he will have you in comfortable\nsurroundings and dressed to stimulate his passion.  If he would\nmarry you, it might be a little better--though still he would\nnever amount to anything as long as his love lasted--the kind of\nlove you inspire.  But he will never marry you.  I learned that\nfrom what I know of his ideas and from what I've observed as to\nyour relations--not from anything he ever said about you.\"\n\nIf Susan had been of the suspicious temperament, or if she had\nbeen a few years older, the manner of this second protest might\nhave set her to thinking how unlike Drumley, the inexpert in\nmatters of love and passion, it was to analyze thus and to form\nsuch judgments.  And thence she might have gone on to consider\nthat Drumley's speeches sounded strangely like paraphrases of\nSpenser's eloquent outbursts when he \"got going.\" But she had\nnot a suspicion.  Besides, her whole being was concentrated upon\nthe idea Drumley was trying to put into words.  She asked:\n\n\"Why are you telling me?\"\n\n\"Because I love him,\" replied Drumley with feeling.  \"We're about\nthe same age, but he's been like my son ever since we struck up\na friendship in the first term of Freshman year.\"\n\n\"Is that your only reason?\"\n\n\"On my honor.\" And so firmly did he believe it, he bore her\nscrutiny as she peered into his face through the dimness.\n\nShe drew back.  \"Yes,\" she said in a low voice, half to herself.\n\"Yes, I believe it is.\" There was silence for a long time, then\nshe asked quietly:\n\n\"What do you think I ought to do?\"\n\n\"Leave him--if you love him,\" replied Drumley.\n\n\"What else can you do?. . .  Stay on and complete his ruin?\"\n\n\"And if I go--what?\"\n\n\"Oh, you can do any one of many things.  You can----\"\n\n\"I mean--what about him?\"\n\n\"He will be like a crazy man for a while.  He'll make that a\nfresh excuse for keeping on as he's going now.  Then he'll brace\nup, and I'll be watching over him, and I'll put him to work in\nthe right direction.  He can't be saved, he can't even be kept\nafloat as long as you are with him, or within reach.  With you\ngone out of his life--his strength will return, his self-respect\ncan be roused.  I've seen the same thing in other cases again and\nagain.  I could tell you any number of stories of----\"\n\n\"He does not care for me?\"\n\n\"In _one_ way, a great deal.  But you're like drink, like a drug\nto him.  It is strange that a woman such as you, devoted,\nsingle-hearted, utterly loving, should be an influence for bad.\nBut it's true of wives also.  The best wives are often the worst.\nThe philosophers are right.  A man needs tranquillity at home.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said she.  \"I understand--perfectly.\"  And her\nvoice was unemotional, as always when she was so deeply moved\nthat she dared not release anything lest all should be released.\n\nShe was like a seated statue.  The moon had moved so that it\nshone upon her face.  He was astonished by its placid calm.  He\nhad expected her to rave and weep, to protest and plead--before\ndenouncing him and bidding him mind his own business.  Instead,\nshe was making it clear that after all she did not care about\nRoderick; probably she was wondering what would become of her,\nnow that her love was ruined.  Well, wasn't it natural?  Wasn't it\naltogether to her credit--wasn't it additional proof that she was\na fine pure woman?  How could she have continued deeply to care\nfor a man scandalously untrue, and drunk much of the time?\nCertainly, it was in no way her fault that Rod made her the\nobject and the victim of the only kind of so-called love of\nwhich he was capable.  No doubt one reason he was untrue to her\nwas that she was too pure for his debauched fancy.  Thus reasoned\nDrumley with that mingling of truth and error characteristic of\nthose who speculate about matters of which they have small and\nunfixed experience.\n\n\"About yourself,\" he proceeded.  \"I have a choice of professions\nfor you--one with a company on the road--on the southern\ncircuit--with good prospects of advancement.  I know, from what\nI have seen of you, and from talks we have had, that you would\ndo well on the stage.  But the life might offend your\nsensibilities.  I should hesitate to recommend it to a delicate,\nfine-fibered woman like you.  The other position is a clerkship\nin a business office in Philadelphia--with an increase as soon\nas you learn stenography and typewriting.  It is respectable.  It\nis sheltered.  It doesn't offer anything brilliant.  But except\nthe stage and literature, nothing brilliant offers for a woman.\nLiterature is out of the question, I think--certainly for the\npresent.  The stage isn't really a place for a woman of lady-like\ninstincts.  So I should recommend the office position.\"\n\nShe remained silent.\n\n\"While my main purpose in talking to you,\" he continued, \"was to\ntry to save him, I can honestly say that it was hardly less my\nintention to save you.  But for that, I'd not have had the\ncourage to speak.  He is on the way down.  He's dragging you with\nhim.  What future have you with him?  You would go on down and\ndown, as low as he should sink and lower.  You've completely\nmerged yourself in him--which might do very well if you were his\nwife and a good influence in his life or a mere negation like\nmost wives.  But in the circumstances it means ruin to you.  Don't\nyou see that?\"\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I was talking about you--your future your----\"\n\n\"Oh, I shall do well enough.\" She rose.  \"I must be going.\"\n\nHer short, indifferent dismissal of what was his real object in\nspeaking--though he did not permit himself to know it--cut him\nto the quick.  He felt a sickening and to him inexplicable sense\nof defeat and disgrace.  Because he must talk to distract his\nmind from himself, he began afresh by saying:\n\n\"You'll think it over?\"\n\n\"I am thinking it over. . . .  I wonder that----\"\n\nWith the fingers of one hand she smoothed her glove on the\nfingers of the other--\"I wonder that I didn't think of it long\nago.  I ought to have thought of it.  I ought to have seen.\"\n\n\"I can't tell you how I hate to have been the----\"\n\n\"Please don't say any more,\" she requested in a tone that made\nit impossible for a man so timid as he to disobey.\n\nNeither spoke until they were in Fifty-ninth Street; then he,\nunable to stand the strain of a silent walk of fifteen blocks,\nsuggested that they take the car down.  She assented.  In the car\nthe stronger light enabled him to see that she was pale in a way\nquite different from her usual clear, healthy pallor, that\nthere was an unfamiliar look about her mouth and her eyes--a\nlook of strain, of repression, of resolve.  These signs and the\ncontrast of her mute motionlessness with her usual vivacity of\nspeech and expression and gesture made him uneasy.\n\n\"I'd advise,\" said he, \"that you reflect on it all carefully and\nconsult with me before you do anything--if you think you ought\nto do anything.\"\n\nShe made no reply.  At the door of the house he had to reach for\nher hand, and her answer to his good night was a vague absent\necho of the word.  \"I've only done what I saw was my duty,\" said\nhe, appealingly.\n\n\"Yes, I suppose so.  I must go in.\"\n\n\"And you'll talk with me before you----\"\n\nThe door had closed behind her; she had not known he was speaking.\n\nWhen Spenser came, about two hours later, and turned on the\nlight in their bedroom, she was in the bed, apparently asleep.\nHe stood staring with theatric self-consciousness at himself in\nthe glass for several minutes, then sat down before the bureau\nand pulled out the third drawer--where he kept collars, ties,\nhandkerchiefs, gloves and a pistol concealed under the\nhandkerchiefs.  With the awful solemnity of the youth who takes\nhimself--and the theater--seriously he lifted the pistol, eyed\nit critically, turning it this way and that as if interested in\nthe reflections of light from the bright cylinder and barrel at\ndifferent angles.  He laid it noiselessly back, covered it over\nwith the handkerchiefs, sat with his fingers resting on the edge\nof the drawer.  Presently he moved uneasily, as a man--on the\nstage or in its amusing imitation called civilized life among\nthe self-conscious classes--moves when he feels that someone is\nbehind him in a \"crucial moment.\"\n\nHe slowly turned round.  She had shifted her position so that her\nface was now toward him.  But her eyes were closed and her face\nwas tranquil.  Still, he hoped she had seen the little episode of\nthe pistol, which he thought fine and impressive.  With his arm\non the back of the chair and supporting that resolute-looking\nchin of his, he stared at her face from under his thick\neyebrows, so thick that although they were almost as fair as his\nhair they seemed dark.  After a while her eyelids fluttered and\nlifted to disclose eyes that startled him, so intense, so\nsleepless were they.\n\n\"Kiss me,\" she said, in her usual sweet, tender way--a little\nshyness, much of passion's sparkle and allure.  \"Kiss me.\"\n\n\"I've often thought,\" said he, \"what would I do if I should go\nsmash, reach the end of my string?  Would I kill you before\ntaking myself off?  Or would that be cowardly?\"\n\nShe had not a doubt that he meant this melodramatic twaddle.  It\ndid not seem twaddle or melodramatic to her--or, for that\nmatter, to him.  She clasped him more closely.  \"What's the\nmatter, dear?\" she asked, her head on his breast.\n\n\"Oh, I've had a row at the _Herald_, and have quit.  But I'll get\nanother place tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Of course.  I wish you'd fix up that play the way Drumley suggested.\"\n\n\"Maybe I shall.  We'll see.\"\n\n\"Anything else wrong?\"\n\n\"Only the same old trouble.  I love you too much.  Too damn much,\"\nhe added in a tone not intended for her ears.  \"Weak fool--that's\nwhat I am.  Weak fool.  I've got _you_, anyhow.  Haven't I?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.  \"I'd do anything for you--anything.\"\n\n\"As long as I keep my eyes on you,\" said he, half mockingly.\n\"I'm weak, but you're weaker.  Aren't you?\"\n\n\"I guess so.  I don't know.\" And she drew a long breath, nestled\ninto his arms, and upon his breast, with her perfumed hair\ndrowsing his senses.\n\nHe soon slept; when he awoke, toward noon, he did not disturb\nher.  He shaved and bathed and dressed, and was about to go out\nwhen she called him.  \"Oh, I thought you were asleep,\" said he.\n\"I can't wait for you to get breakfast.  I must get a move on.\"\n\n\"Still blue?\"\n\n\"No, indeed.\" But his face was not convincing.  \"So long, pet.\"\n\n\"Aren't you going to kiss me good-by?\"\n\nHe laughed tenderly, yet in bitter self-mockery too.  \"And waste\nan hour or so?  Not much.  What a siren you are!\"\n\nShe put her hand over her face quickly.\n\n\"Now, perhaps I can risk one kiss.\" He bent over her; his lips\ntouched her hair.  She stretched out her hand, laid it against\nhis cheek.  \"Dearest,\" she murmured.\n\n\"I must go.\"\n\n\"Just a minute.  No, don't look at me.  Turn your face so that I\ncan see your profile--so!\" She had turned his head with a hand\nthat gently caressed as it pushed.  \"I like that view best.  Yes,\nyou are strong and brave.  You will succeed!  No--I'll not keep\nyou a minute.\" She kissed his hand, rested her head for an\ninstant on his lap as he sat on the edge of the bed, suddenly\nflung herself to the far side of the bed, with her face toward\nthe wall.\n\n\"Go to sleep again, lazy!\" cried he.  \"I'll try to be home about\ndinner-time.  See that you behave today!  Good lord, how hard it\nis to leave you!  Having you makes nothing else seem worth while.\nGood-by!\"\n\nAnd he was off.  She started to a sitting posture, listened to\nthe faint sound of his descending footsteps.  She darted to the\nwindow, leaned out, watched him until he rounded the corner into\nBroadway.  Then she dropped down with elbows on the window sill\nand hands pressing her cheeks; she stared unseeingly at the\nopposite house, at a gilt cage with a canary hopping and\nchirping within.  And once more she thought all the thoughts that\nhad filled her mind in the sleepless hours of that night and\nmorning.  Her eyes shifted in color from pure gray to pure\nviolet--back and forth, as emotion or thought dominated her\nmind.  She made herself coffee in the French machine, heated the\nmilk she brought every day from the dairy, drank her _café au\nlait_ slowly, reading the newspaper advertisements for \"help\nwanted--female\"--a habit she had formed when she first came to\nNew York and had never altogether dropped.  When she finished\nher coffee she took the scissors and cut out several of the\ndemands for help.\n\nShe bathed and dressed.  She moved through the routine of\nlife--precisely as we all do, whatever may be in our minds and\nhearts.  She went out, crossed Long Acre and entered the shop of\na dealer in women's cast-off clothes.  She reappeared in the\nstreet presently with a fat, sloppy looking woman in black.  She\ntook her to the rooms, offered for sale her entire wardrobe\nexcept the dress she had on and one other, the simply trimmed\nsailor upon her head, the ties on her feet and one pair of boots\nand a few small articles.  After long haggling the woman made a\nfinal price--ninety-five dollars for things, most of them almost\nnew, which had cost upwards of seven hundred.  Susan accepted the\noffer; she knew she could do no better.  The woman departed,\nreturned with a porter and several huge sweets of wrapping\npaper.  The two made three bundles of the purchases; the money\nwas paid over; they and Susan's wardrobe departed.\n\nNext, Susan packed in the traveling bag she had brought from\nCincinnati the between seasons dress of brown serge she had\nwithheld, and some such collection of bare necessities as she\nhad taken with her when she left George Warham's.  Into the bag\nshe put the pistol from under Spenser's handkerchiefs in the\nthird bureau drawer.  When all was ready, she sent for the maid\nto straighten the rooms.  While the maid was at work, she wrote\nthis note:\n\n\nDEAREST--Mr. Drumley will tell you why I have gone.  You will\nfind some money under your handkerchiefs in the bureau.  When you\nare on your feet again, I may come--if you want me.  It won't be\nany use for you to look for me.  I ought to have gone before, but\nI was selfish and blind.  Good-by, dear love--I wasn't so bad as\nyou always suspected.  I was true to you, and for the sake of\nwhat you have been to me and done for me I couldn't be so\nungrateful as not to go.  Don't worry about me.  I shall get on.\nAnd so will you.  It's best for us both.  Good-by, dear heart--I\nwas true to you.  Good-by.\n\n\nShe sealed this note, addressed it, fastened it over the mantel\nin the sitting-room where they always put notes for each other.\nAnd after she had looked in each drawer and in the closet at all\nhis clothing, and had kissed the pillow on which his head had\nlain, she took her bag and went.  She had left for him the\nninety-five dollars and also eleven dollars of the money she had\nin her purse.  She took with her two five-dollar bills and a\ndollar and forty cents in change.\n\nThe violet waned in her eyes, and in its stead came the gray of\nthought and action.\n\n\n********THE END OF VOLUME I*******\n\n\n\nSUSAN LENOX: HER FALL AND RISE\n\nby\nDavid Graham Phillips\n\nVolume II\n\nWITH A PORTRAIT\nOF THE AUTHOR\n\nD. APPLETON AND COMPANY\nNEW YORK        LONDON\n1917\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nSUSAN'S impulse was toward the stage.  It had become a\ndefinite ambition with her, the stronger because Spenser's\njealousy and suspicion had forced her to keep it a secret, to\npretend to herself that she had no thought but going on\nindefinitely as his obedient and devoted mistress.  The\nhardiest and best growths are the growths inward--where they\nhave sun and air from without.  She had been at the theater\nseveral times every week, and had studied the performances at\na point of view very different from that of the audience.  It\nwas there to be amused; she was there to learn.  Spenser and\nsuch of his friends as he would let meet her talked plays and\nacting most of the time.  He had forbidden her to have women\nfriends.  \"Men don't demoralize women; women demoralize each\nother,\" was one of his axioms.  But such women as she had a\nbowing acquaintance with were all on the stage--in comic\noperas or musical farces.  She was much alone; that meant many\nhours every day which could not but be spent by a mind like\nhers in reading and in thinking.  Only those who have observed\nthe difference aloneness makes in mental development, where\nthere is a good mind, can appreciate how rapidly, how broadly,\nSusan expanded.  She read plays more than any other kind of\nliterature. She did not read them casually but was always\nthinking how they would act.  She was soon making in\nimagination stage scenes out of dramatic chapters in novels as\nshe read.  More and more clearly the characters of play and\nnovel took shape and substance before the eyes of her fancy.\nBut the stage was clearly out of the question.\n\nWhile the idea of a stage career had been dominant, she had\nthought in other directions, also.  Every Sunday, indeed almost\nevery day, she found in the newspapers articles on the subject\nof work for women.\n\n\"Why do you waste time on that stuff?\" said Drumley, when he\ndiscovered her taste for it.\n\n\"Oh, a woman never can tell what may happen,\" replied she.\n\n\"She'll never learn anything from those fool articles,\"\nanswered he.  \"You ought to hear the people who get them up\nlaughing about them.  I see now why they are printed.  It's good\nfor circulation, catches the women--even women like you.\"\nHowever, she persisted in reading.  But never did she find an\narticle that contained a really practical suggestion--that is,\none applying to the case of a woman who had to live on what\nshe made at the start, who was without experience and without\na family to help her.  All around her had been women who were\nmaking their way; but few indeed of them--even of those\nregarded as successful--were getting along without outside aid\nof some kind.  So when she read or thought or inquired about\nwork for women, she was sometimes amused and oftener made\nunhappy by the truth as to the conditions, that when a common\nworker rises it is almost always by the helping hand of a man,\nand rarely indeed a generous hand--a painful and shameful\ntruth which a society resolved at any cost to think well of\nitself fiercely conceals from itself and hypocritically lies about.\n\nShe felt now that there was hope in only one direction--hope\nof occupation that would enable her to live in physical, moral\nand mental decency.  She must find some employment where she\ncould as decently as might be realize upon her physical\nassets.  The stage would be best--but the stage was impossible,\nat least for the time.  Later on she would try for it; there\nwas in her mind not a doubt of that, for unsuspected of any\nwho knew her there lay, beneath her sweet and gentle exterior,\nbeneath her appearance of having been created especially for\nlove and laughter and sympathy, tenacity of purpose and daring\nof ambition that were--rarely--hinted at the surface in her\nmoments of abstraction.  However, just now the stage was\nimpossible.  Spenser would find her immediately.  She must go\ninto another part of town, must work at something that touched\nhis life at no point.\n\nShe had often been told that her figure would be one of her\nchief assets as a player.  And ready-made clothes fitted her\nwith very slight alterations--showing that she had a model\nfigure.  The advertisements she had cut out were for cloak\nmodels.  Within an hour after she left Forty-fourth Street, she\nfound at Jeffries and Jonas, in Broadway a few doors below\nHouston, a vacancy that had not yet been filled--though as a\nrule all the help needed was got from the throng of applicants\nwaiting when the store opened.\n\n\"Come up to my office,\" said Jeffries, who happened to be near\nthe door as she entered.  \"We'll see how you shape up.  We want\nsomething extra--something dainty and catchy.\"\n\nHe was a short thick man, with flat feet, a flat face and an\nalmost bald head.  In his flat nostrils, in the hollows of his\ngreat forward bent ears and on the lobes were bunches of\ncoarse, stiff gray hairs.  His eyebrows bristled; his small,\nsly brown eyes twinkled with good nature and with sensuality.\nHis skin had the pallor that suggests kidney trouble.  His\nwords issued from his thick mouth as if he were tasting each\nbeforehand--and liked the flavor.  He led Susan into his private\noffice, closed the door, took a tape measure from his desk.\n\"Now, my dear,\" said he, eyeing her form gluttonously, \"we'll\nsize you up--eh?  You're exactly the build I like.\"\n\nAnd under the pretense of taking her measurements, he fumbled\nand felt, pinched and stroked every part of her person,\nlaughing and chuckling the while.  \"My, but you are sweet!  And\nso firm!  What flesh!  Solid--solid!  Mighty healthy!  You are a\ngood girl--eh?\"\n\n\"I am a married woman.\"\n\n\"But you've got no ring.\"\n\n\"I've never worn a ring.\"\n\n\"Well--well!  I believe that is one of the new wrinkles, but I\ndon't approve.  I'm an old-fashioned family man.  Let me see\nagain.  Now, don't mind a poor old man like me, my dear.  I've\ngot a wife--the best woman in the world, and I've never been\nuntrue to her.  A look over the fence occasionally--but not an\ninch out of the pasture.  Don't stiffen yourself like that.  I\ncan't judge, when you do.  Not too much hips--neither sides nor\nback.  Fine!  Fine!  And the thigh slender--yes--quite lovely, my\ndear.  Thick thighs spoil the hang of garments.  Yes--yes--a\nsplendid figure.  I'll bet the bosom is a corker--fine skin and\nnice ladylike size.  You can have the place.\"\n\n\"What does it pay?\" she asked.\n\n\"Ten dollars, to start with.  Splendid wages.  _I_ started on\ntwo fifty.  But I forgot--you don't know the business?\"\n\n\"No--nothing about it,\" was her innocent, honest answer.\n\n\"Ah--well, then--nine dollars--eh?\"\n\nSusan hesitated.\n\n\"You can make quite a neat little bunch on the outside--_you_\ncan.  We cater only to the best trade, and the buyers who come\nto us are big easy spenders.  But I'm supposed to know nothing\nabout that.  You'll find out from the other girls.\"  He\nchuckled.  \"Oh, it's a nice soft life except for a few weeks\nalong at this part of the year--and again in winter.  Well--ten\ndollars, then.\"\n\nSusan accepted. It was more than she had expected to get; it\nwas less than she could hope to live on in New York in\nanything approaching the manner a person of any refinement or\ntastes or customs of comfort regards as merely decent.  She\nmust descend again to the tenements, must resume the fight\nagainst that physical degradation which sooner or later\nimposes--upon those _descending_ to it--a degradation of mind\nand heart deeper, more saturating, more putrefying than any\nthat ever originated from within.  Not so long as her figure\nlasted was she the worse off for not knowing a trade.  Jeffries\nwas telling the truth; she would be getting splendid wages,\nnot merely for a beginner but for any woman of the working\nclass.  Except in rare occasional instances wages and salaries\nfor women were kept down below the standard of decency by\nwoman's peculiar position--by such conditions as that most\nwomen took up work as a temporary makeshift or to piece out a\nfamily's earnings, and that almost any woman could\nsupplement--and so many did supplement--their earnings at\nlabor with as large or larger earnings in the stealthy\nshameful way.  Where was there a trade that would bring a girl\nten dollars a week at the start?  Even if she were a\nsemi-professional, a stenographer and typewriter, it would\ntake expertness and long service to lift her up to such wages.\nThanks to her figure--to its chancing to please old Jeffries'\ntaste--she was better off than all but a few working women,\nthan all but a few workingmen. She was of the labor aristocracy;\nand if she had been one of a family of  workers she would\nhave been counted an enviable favorite of fortune.  Unfortunately,\nshe was alone unfortunately for herself, not at all from the\nstandpoint of the tenement class she was now joining.  Among them\nshe would be a person who could afford the luxuries of life as\nlife reveals itself to the tenements.\n\n\"Tomorrow morning at seven o'clock,\" said Jeffries.  \"You have\nlost your husband?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I saw you'd had great grief.  No insurance, I judge?  Well--you\nwill find another--maybe a rich one.  No--you'll not have to\nsleep alone long, my dear.\"  And he patted her on the shoulder,\ngave her a parting fumble of shoulders and arms.\n\nShe was able to muster a grateful smile; for she felt a rare\nkindness of heart under the familiar animalism to which\ngood-looking, well-formed women who go about much unescorted\nsoon grow accustomed.  Also, experience had taught her that, as\nthings go with girls of the working class, his treatment was\ncourteous, considerate, chivalrous almost.  With men in\nabsolute control of all kinds of work, with women stimulating\nthe sex appetite by openly or covertly using their charms as\nfemale to assist them in the cruel struggle for\nexistence--what was to be expected?\n\nHer way to the elevator took her along aisles lined with\ntables, hidden under masses of cloaks, jackets, dresses and\nmaterials for making them.  They exuded the odors of the\nfactory--faint yet pungent odors that brought up before her\nvisions of huge, badly ventilated rooms, where women aged or\nageing swiftly were toiling hour after hour\nmonotonously--spending half of each day in buying the right to\neat and sleep unhealthily.  The odors--or, rather, the visions\nthey evoked--made her sick at heart.  For the moment she came\nfrom under the spell of her peculiar trait--her power to do\nwithout whimper or vain gesture of revolt the inevitable\nthing, whatever it was.  She paused to steady herself, half\nleaning against a lofty up-piling of winter cloaks.  A girl,\nyoung at first glance, not nearly so young thereafter,\nsuddenly appeared before her--a girl whose hair had the sheen\nof burnished brass and whose soft smooth skin was of that\nfrog-belly whiteness which suggests an inheritance of some\nbleaching and blistering disease.  She had small regular\nfeatures, eyes that at once suggested looseness, good-natured\nyet mercenary too.  She was dressed in the sleek tight-fitting\ntrying-on robe of the professional model, and her figure was\nsuperb in its firm luxuriousness.\n\n\"Sick?\" asked the girl with real kindliness.\n\n\"No--only dizzy for the moment.\"\n\n\"I suppose you've had a hard day.\"\n\n\"It might have been easier,\" Susan replied, attempting a smile.\n\n\"It's no fun, looking for a job.  But you've caught on?\"\n\n\"Yes.  He took me.\"\n\n\"I made a bet with myself that he would when I saw you go in.\"\nThe girl laughed agreeably.  \"He picked you for Gideon.\"\n\n\"What department is that?\"\n\nThe girl laughed again, with a cynical squinting of the eyes.\n\"Oh, Gideon's our biggest customer.  He buys for the largest\nhouse in Chicago.\"\n\n\"I'm looking for a place to live,\" said Susan. \"Some place in\nthis part of town.\"\n\n\"How much do you want to spend?\"\n\n\"I'm to have ten a week.  So I can't afford more than twelve or\nfourteen a month for rent, can I?\"\n\n\"If you happen to have to live on the ten,\" was the reply with\na sly, merry smile.\n\n\"It's all I've got.\"\n\nAgain the girl laughed, the good-humored mercenary eyes twinkling\nrakishly.  \"Well--you can't get much for fourteen a month.\"\n\n\"I don't care, so long as it's clean.\"\n\n\"Gee, you're reasonable, ain't you?\" cried the girl.  \"Clean!\nI pay fourteen a week, and all kinds of things come through\nthe cracks from the other apartments.  You must be a stranger\nto little old New York--bugtown, a lady friend of mine calls\nit.  Alone?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Um--\"  The girl shook her head dubiously.  \"Rents are mighty\nsteep in New York, and going up all the time.  You see, the\nrich people that own the lands and houses here need a lot of\nmoney in their business.  You've got either to take a room or\npart of one in with some tenement family, respectable but\nnoisy and dirty and not at all refined, or else you've got to\nlive in a house where everything goes.  You want to live\nrespectable, I judge?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That's the way with me.  Do what you please, _I_ say, but for\n_God's sake_, don't make yourself _common!_  You'll want to be\nfree to have your gentlemen friends come--and at the same time\na room you'll not be ashamed for 'em to see on account of dirt\nand smells and common people around.\"\n\n\"I shan't want to see anyone in my room.\"\n\nThe young woman winced, then went on with hasty enthusiasm.\n\n\"I knew you were refined the minute I looked at you.  I think\nyou might get a room in the house of a lady friend of mine--Mrs.\nTucker, up in Clinton Place near University Place--an\nelegant neighborhood--that is, the north side of the street.\nThe south side's kind o' low, on account of dagoes having\nmoved in there.  They live like vermin--but then all tenement\npeople do.\"\n\n\"They've got to,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Yes, that's a fact.  Ain't it awful?  I'll write down the name\nand address of my lady friend.  I'm Miss Mary Hinkle.\"\n\n\"My name is Lorna Sackville,\" said Susan, in response to the\nexpectant look of Miss Hinkle.\n\n\"My, what a swell name!  You've been sick, haven't you?\"\n\n\"No, I'm never sick.\"\n\n\"Me too.  My mother taught me to stop eating as soon as I felt\nbad, and not to eat again till I was all right.\"\n\n\"I do that, too,\" said Susan.  \"Is it good for the health?\"\n\n\"It starves the doctors.  You've never worked before?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--I've worked in a factory.\"\n\nMiss Hinkle looked disappointed.  Then she gave Susan a side\nglance of incredulity.  \"I'd never, a' thought it.  But I can\nsee you weren't brought up to that.  I'll write the address.\"\nAnd she went back through the showroom, presently to reappear\nwith a card which she gave Susan.  \"You'll find Mrs. Tucker a\nperfect lady--too much a lady to get on.  I tell her she'll go\nto ruin--and she will.\"\n\nSusan thanked Miss Hinkle and departed.  A few minutes' walk\nbrought her to the old, high-stooped, brown-stone where Mrs.\nTucker lived.  The dents, scratches and old paint scales on the\ndoor, the dust-streaked windows, the slovenly hang of the\nimitation lace window curtains proclaimed the cheap\nmiddle-class lodging or boarding house of the humblest grade.\nRespectable undoubtedly; for the fitfully prosperous\noffenders against laws and morals insist upon better\naccommodations.  Susan's heart sank.  She saw that once more she\nwas clinging at the edge of the precipice.  And what hope was\nthere that she would get back to firm ground?  Certainly not by\n\"honest labor.\"  Back to the tenement!  \"Yes, I'm on the way\nback,\" she said to herself.  However, she pulled the loose\nbell-knob and was admitted to a dingy, dusty hallway by a maid\nso redolent of stale perspiration that it was noticeable even\nin the hall's strong saturation of smells of cheap cookery.\nThe parlor furniture was rapidly going to pieces; the chromos\nand prints hung crazily awry; dust lay thick upon the center\ntable, upon the chimney-piece, upon the picture frames, upon\nthe carving in the rickety old chairs.  Only by standing did\nSusan avoid service as a dust rag.  It was typical of the\nprofound discouragement that blights or blasts all but a small\narea of our modern civilization--a discouragement due in part\nto ignorance--but not at all to the cause usually assigned--to\n\"natural shiftlessness.\"  It is chiefly due to an unconscious\ninstinctive feeling of the hopelessness of the average lot.\n\nWhile Susan explained to Mrs. Tucker how she had come and what\nshe could afford, she examined her with results far from\ndisagreeable.  One glance into that homely wrinkled face was\nenough to convince anyone of her goodness of heart--and to\nSusan in those days of aloneness, of uncertainty, of the\nfeeling of hopelessness, goodness of heart seemed the supreme\ncharm.  Such a woman as a landlady, and a landlady in New York,\nwas pathetically absurd.  Even to still rather simple-minded\nSusan she seemed an invitation to the swindler, to the sponger\nwith the hard-luck story, to the sinking who clutch about\ndesperately and drag down with them everyone who permits them\nto get a hold.\n\n\"I've only got one room,\" said Mrs. Tucker.  \"That's not any\ntoo nice.  I did rather calculate to get five a week for it,\nbut you are the kind I like to have in the house.  So if you\nwant it I'll let it to you for fourteen a month.  And I do hope\nyou'll pay as steady as you can.  There's so many in such hard\nlines that I have a tough time with my rent.  I've got to pay\nmy rent, you know.\"\n\n\"I'll go as soon as I can't pay,\" replied Susan.  The\nlandlady's apologetic tone made her sick at heart, as a\nsensitive human being must ever feel in the presence of a\nfellow-being doomed to disaster.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Mrs. Tucker gratefully.  \"I do wish----\"  She\nchecked herself.  \"No, I don't mean that.  They do the best they\ncan--and I'll botch along somehow.  I look at the bright side\nof things.\"\n\nThe incurable optimism of the smile accompanying these words\nmoved Susan, abnormally bruised and tender of heart that\nmorning, almost to tears.  A woman with her own way to make,\nand always looking at the bright side!\n\n\"How long have you had this house?\"\n\n\"Only five months.  My husband died a year ago.  I had to give\nup our little business six months after his death.  Such a nice\nlittle stationery store, but I couldn't seem to refuse credit\nor to collect bills.  Then I came here.  This looks like losing,\ntoo.  But I'm sure I'll come out all right.  The Lord will\nprovide, as the Good Book says.  I don't have no trouble\nkeeping the house full.  Only they don't seem to pay.  You want\nto see your room?\"\n\nShe and Susan ascended three flights to the top story--to a\ncloset of a room at the back.  The walls were newly and\nbrightly papered.  The sloping roof of the house made one wall\na ceiling also, and in this two small windows were set.  The\nfurniture was a tiny bed, white and clean as to its linen, a\ntable, two chairs, a small washstand with a little bowl and a\nless pitcher, a soap dish and a mug.  Along one wall ran a row\nof hooks.  On the floor was an old and incredibly dirty carpet,\nmitigated by a strip of clean matting which ran from the door,\nbetween washstand and bed, to one of the windows.\n\nSusan glanced round--a glance was enough to enable her to see\nall--all that was there, all that the things there implied.\nBack to the tenement life!  She shuddered.\n\n\"It ain't much,\" said Mrs. Tucker.  \"But usually rooms like\nthese rents for five a week.\"\n\nThe sun had heated the roof scorching hot; the air of this\nroom, immediately underneath, was like that of a cellar where\na furnace is in full blast.  But Susan knew she was indeed in\nluck.  \"It's clean and nice here,\" said she to Mrs. Tucker,\n\"and I'm much obliged to you for being so reasonable with me.\"\nAnd to clinch the bargain she then and there paid half a\nmonth's rent.  \"I'll give you the rest when my week at the\nstore's up.\"\n\n\"No hurry,\" said Mrs. Tucker who was handling the money and\nlooking at it with glistening grateful eyes.  \"Us poor folks\noughtn't to be hard on each other--though, Lord knows, if we\nwas, I reckon we'd not be quite so poor.  It's them that has\nthe streak of hard in 'em what gets on.  But the Bible teaches\nus that's what to expect in a world of sin.  I suppose you want\nto go now and have your trunk sent?\"\n\n\"This is all I've got,\" said Susan, indicating her bag on the table.\n\nInto Mrs. Tucker's face came a look of terror that made Susan\nrealize in an instant how hard-pressed she must be.  It was the\nkind of look that comes into the eyes of the deer brought down\nby the dogs when it sees the hunter coming up.\n\n\"But I've a good place,\" Susan hastened to say.  \"I get ten a week.\nAnd as I told you before, when I can't pay I'll go right away.\"\n\n\"I've lost so much in bad debts,\" explained the landlady\nhumbly.  \"I don't seem to see which way to turn.\"  Then she\nbrightened.  \"It'll all come out for the best.  I work hard\nand I try to do right by everybody.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it will,\" said Susan believingly.\n\nOften her confidence in the moral ideals trained into her from\nchildhood had been sorely tried.  But never had she permitted\nherself more than a hasty, ashamed doubt that the only way to\nget on was to work and to practice the Golden Rule.  Everyone\nwho was prosperous attributed his prosperity to the steadfast\nfollowing of that way; as for those who were not prosperous,\nthey were either lazy or bad-hearted, or would have been even\nworse off had they been less faithful to the creed that was\nbest policy as well as best for peace of mind and heart.\n\nIn trying to be as inexpensive to Spenser as she could\ncontrive, and also because of her passion for improving\nherself, Susan had explored far into the almost unknown art of\nliving, on its shamefully neglected material side.  She had\ncultivated the habit of spending much time about her purchases\nof every kind--had spent time intelligently in saving money\nintelligently.  She had gone from shop to shop, comparing\nvalues and prices.  She had studied quality in food and in\nclothing, and thus she had discovered what enormous sums are\nwasted through ignorance--wasted by poor even more lavishly\nthan by rich or well-to-do, because the shops where the poor\ndealt had absolutely no check on their rapacity through the\noccasional canny customer.  She had learned the fundamental\ntruth of the material art of living; only when a good thing\nhappens to be cheap is a cheap thing good.  Spenser,\ncross-examining her as to how she passed the days, found out\nabout this education she was acquiring.  It amused him.  \"A\nwaste of time!\" he used to say.  \"Pay what they ask, and don't\nbother your head with such petty matters.\"  He might have\nsuspected and accused her of being stingy had not her\ngenerosity been about the most obvious and incessant trait of\nher character.\n\nShe was now reduced to an income below what life can be\ndecently maintained upon--the life of a city-dweller with\nnormal tastes for cleanliness and healthfulness.  She proceeded\nwithout delay to put her invaluable education into use.  She\nmust fill her mind with the present and with the future.  She\nmust not glance back.  She must ignore her wounds--their aches,\ntheir clamorous throbs.  She took off her clothes, as soon as\nMrs. Tucker left her alone, brushed them and hung them up, put\non the thin wrapper she had brought in her bag.  The fierce\nheat of the little packing-case of a room became less\nunendurable; also, she was saving the clothes from useless\nwear.  She sat down at the table and with pencil and paper\nplanned her budget.\n\nOf the ten dollars a week, three dollars and thirty cents must\nbe subtracted for rent--for shelter.  This left six dollars and\nseventy cents for the other two necessaries, food and\nclothing--there must be no incidental expenses since there was\nno money to meet them.  She could not afford to provide for\ncarfare on stormy days; a rain coat, overshoes and umbrella,\nmore expensive at the outset, were incomparably cheaper in the\nlong run.  Her washing and ironing she would of course do for\nherself in the evenings and on Sundays.  Of the two items which\nthe six dollars and seventy cents must cover, food came first\nin importance.  How little could she live on?\n\nThat stifling hot room!  She was as wet as if she had come undried\nfrom a bath.  She had thought she could never feel anything but\nlove for the sun of her City of the Sun.  But this undreamed-of\nheat--like the cruel caresses of a too impetuous lover--\n\nHow little could she live on?\n\nDividing her total of six dollars and seventy cents by seven,\nshe found that she had ninety-five cents a day.  She would soon\nhave to buy clothes, however scrupulous care she might take of\nthose she possessed.  It was modest indeed to estimate fifteen\ndollars for clothes before October.  That meant she must save\nfifteen dollars in the remaining three weeks of June, in July,\nAugust and September--in one hundred and ten days.  She must\nsave about fifteen cents a day.  And out of that she must buy\nsoap and tooth powder, outer and under clothes, perhaps a hat\nand a pair of shoes.  Thus she could spend for food not more\nthan eighty cents a day, as much less as was consistent with\nbuying the best quality--for she had learned by bitter\nexperience the ravages poor quality food makes in health and\nlooks, had learned why girls of the working class go to pieces\nswiftly after eighteen.  She must fight to keep health--sick\nshe did not dare be.  She must fight to keep looks--her figure\nwas her income.\n\nEighty cents a day. The outlook was not so gloomy.  A cup of\ncocoa in the morning--made at home of the best cocoa, the kind\nthat did not overheat the blood and disorder the skin--it\nwould cost her less than ten cents.  She would carry lunch with\nher to the store.  In the evening she would cook a chop or\nsomething of that kind on the gas stove she would buy.  Some\ndays she would be able to save twenty or even twenty-five\ncents toward clothing and the like.  Whatever else happened,\nshe was resolved never again to sink to dirt and rags.  Never\nagain!--never!  She had passed through that experience once\nwithout loss of self-respect only because it was by way of\neducation.  To go through it again would be yielding ground in\nthe fight--the fight for a destiny worth while which some latent\nbut mighty instinct within her never permitted her to forget.\n\nShe sat at the table, with the shutters closed against the\nfiery light of the summer afternoon sun.  That hideous\nunacceptable heat!  With eyelids drooped--deep and dark were the\ncircles round them--she listened to the roar of the city, a\nsavage sound like the clamor of a multitude of famished wild\nbeasts.  A city like the City of Destruction in \"Pilgrim's\nProgress\"--a city where of all the millions, but a few\nthousands were moving toward or keeping in the sunlight of\ncivilization.  The rest, the swarms of the cheap boarding\nhouses, cheap lodging houses, tenements--these myriads were\nsquirming in darkness and squalor, ignorant and never to be\nless ignorant, ill fed and never to be better fed, clothed in\npitiful absurd rags or shoddy vulgar attempts at finery, and\nnever to be better clothed.  She would not be of those!  She\nwould struggle on, would sink only to mount.  She would work;\nshe would try to do as nearly right as she could.  And in the\nend she must triumph.  She would get at least a good part of\nwhat her soul craved, of what her mind craved, of what her\nheart craved.\n\nThe heat of this tenement room!  The heat to which poverty was\nexposed naked and bound!  Would not anyone be justified in\ndoing anything--yes, _anything_--to escape from this fiend?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nELLEN, the maid, slept across the hall from Susan, in a closet\nso dirty that no one could have risked in it any article of\nclothing with the least pretension to cleanness.  It was no\nbetter, no worse than the lodgings of more than two hundred\nthousand New Yorkers.  Its one narrow opening, beside the door,\ngave upon a shaft whose odors were so foul that she kept the\nwindow closed, preferring heat like the inside of a steaming\npan to the only available \"outside air.\"  This in a civilized\ncity where hundreds of dogs with jeweled collars slept in\nluxurious rooms on downiest beds and had servants to wait upon\nthem!  The morning after Susan's coming, Ellen woke her, as\nthey had arranged, at a quarter before five.  The night before,\nSusan had brought up from the basement a large bucket of water;\nfor she had made up her mind, to take a bath every day, at\nleast until the cold weather set in and rendered such a luxury\nimpossible.  With this water and what she had in her little\npitcher, Susan contrived to freshen herself up.  She had bought\na gas stove and some indispensable utensils for three dollars\nand seventeen cents in a Fourteenth Street store, a pound of\ncocoa for seventy cents and ten cents' worth of rolls--three\nrolls, well baked, of first quality flour and with about as\ngood butter and other things put into the dough as one can\nexpect in bread not made at home.  These purchases had reduced\nher cash to forty-three cents--and she ought to buy without\ndelay a clock with an alarm attachment.  And pay\nday--Saturday--was two days away.\n\nShe made a cup of cocoa, drank it slowly, eating one of the\nrolls--all in the same methodical way like a machine that\ncontinues to revolve after the power has been shut off.  It was\nthen, even more than during her first evening alone, even more\nthan when she from time to time startled out of troubled\nsleep--it was then, as she forced down her lonely breakfast,\nthat she most missed Rod.  When she had finished, she completed\nher toilet.  The final glance at herself in the little mirror\nwas depressing.  She looked fresh for her new surroundings and\nfor her new class.  But in comparison with what she usually\nlooked, already there was a distinct, an ominous falling off.\n\"I'm glad Rod never saw me looking like this,\" she said aloud\ndrearily.  Taking a roll for lunch, she issued forth at\nhalf-past six.  The hour and three-quarters she had allowed for\ndressing and breakfasting had been none too much.  In the\ncoolness and comparative quiet she went down University Place\nand across Washington Square under the old trees, all alive\nwith song and breeze and flashes of early morning light.  She\nwas soon in Broadway's deep canyon, was drifting absently along\nin the stream of cross, mussy-looking workers pushing\nsouthward.  Her heart ached, her brain throbbed.  It was\nhorrible, this loneliness; and every one of the wounds where\nshe had severed the ties with Spenser was bleeding.  She was\nastonished to find herself before the building whose upper\nfloors were occupied by Jeffries and Jonas.  How had she got\nthere?  Where had she crossed Broadway?\n\n\"Good morning, Miss Sackville.\"  It was Miss Hinkle, just\narriving.  Her eyes were heavy, and there were the criss-cross\nlines under them that tell a story to the expert in the\ndifferent effects of different kinds of dissipation.  Miss\nHinkle was showing her age--and she was \"no spring chicken.\"\n\nSusan returned her greeting, gazing at her with the dazed eyes\nand puzzled smile of an awakening sleeper.\n\n\"I'll show you the ropes,\" said Miss Hinkle, as they climbed\nthe two flights of stairs.  \"You'll find the job dead easy.\nThey're mighty nice people to work for, Mr. Jeffries\nespecially.  Not easy fruit, of course, but nice for people\nthat have got on.  You didn't sleep well?\"\n\n\"Yes--I think so.\"\n\n\"I didn't have a chance to drop round last night.  I was out\nwith one of the buyers.  How do you like Mrs. Tucker?\"\n\n\"She's very good, isn't she?\"\n\n\"She'll never get along.  She works hard, too--but not for\nherself.  In this world you have to look out for Number One.\nI had a swell dinner last night.  Lobster--I love lobster--and\nelegant champagne--up to Murray's--such a refined place--all\nfountains and mirrors--really quite artistic.  And my gentleman\nfriend was so nice and respectful.  You know, we have to go out\nwith the buyers when they ask us.  It helps the house sell\ngoods.  And we have to be careful not to offend them.\"\n\nMiss Hinkle's tone in the last remark was so significant that\nSusan looked at her--and, looking, understood.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" pursued Miss Hinkle, eyes carefully averted,\n\"sometimes a new girl goes out with an important customer and\nhe gets fresh and she kicks and complains to Mr. Jeffries--or\nMr. Jonas--or Mr. Ratney, the head man.  They always sympathize\nwith her--but--well, I've noticed that somehow she soon loses\nher job.\"\n\n\"What do you do when--when a customer annoys you?\"\n\n\"I!\" Miss Hinkle laughed with some embarrassment.  \"Oh, I do\nthe best I can.\"  A swift glance of the cynical, laughing,\n\"fast\" eyes at Susan and away.  \"The best I can--for the\nhouse--and for myself.  .  .  .  I talk to you because I know\nyou're a lady and because I don't want to see you thrown down.\nA woman that's living quietly at home--like a lady--she can be\nsqueamish.  But out in the world a woman can't afford to\nbe--no, nor a man, neither.  You don't find this set down in the\nbooks, and they don't preach it in the churches--leastways they\ndidn't when I used to go to church.  But it's true, all the same.\"\n\nThey were a few minutes early; so Miss Hinkle continued the\nconversation while they waited for the opening of the room\nwhere Susan would be outfitted for her work.  \"I called you\nMiss Sackville,\" said she, \"but you've been married--haven't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I can always tell--or at least I can see whether a woman's had\nexperience or not.  Well, I've never been regularly married,\nand I don't expect to, unless something pretty good offers.\nThink I'd marry one of these rotten little clerks?\"  Miss Hinkle\nanswered her own question with a scornful sniff.  \"They can\nhardly make a living for themselves.  And a man who amounts to\nanything, he wants a refined lady to help him on up, not a\nworking girl.  Of course, there're exceptions.  But as a rule\na girl in our position either has to stay single or marry\nbeneath her--marry some mechanic or such like.  Well, I ain't\nso lazy, or so crazy about being supported, that I'd sink to be\ncook and slop-carrier--and worse--for a carpenter or a\nbricklayer.  Going out with the buyers--the gentlemanly\nones--has spoiled my taste.  I can't stand a coarse man--coarse\ndress and hands and manners.  Can you?\"\n\nSusan turned hastily away, so that her face was hidden from\nMiss Hinkle.\n\n\"I'll bet you wasn't married to a coarse man.\"\n\n\"I'd rather not talk about myself,\" said Susan with an effort.\n\"It's not pleasant.\"\n\nHer manner of checking Miss Hinkle's friendly curiosity did not\ngive offense; it excited the experienced working woman's\nsympathy.  She went on:\n\n\"Well, I feel sorry for any woman that has to work.  Of course\nmost women do--and at worse than anything in the stores and\nfactories.  As between being a drudge to some dirty common\nlaborer like most women are, and working in a factory even,\ngive me the factory.  Yes, give me a job as a pot slinger even,\nlow as that is.  Oh, I _hate_ working people!  I love\nrefinement.  Up to Murray's last night I sat there, eating my\nlobster and drinking my wine, and I pretended I was a\nlady--and, my, how happy I was!\"\n\nThe stockroom now opened.  Susan, with the help of Miss Hinkle\nand the stock keeper, dressed in one of the tight-fitting satin\nslips that revealed every curve and line of her form, made\nevery motion however slight, every breath she drew, a gesture\nof sensuousness.  As she looked at herself in a long glass in\none of the show-parlors, her face did not reflect the\nadmiration frankly displayed upon the faces of the two other\nwomen.  That satin slip seemed to have a moral quality, an\nimmoral character.  It made her feel naked--no, as if she were\nnaked and being peeped at through a crack or keyhole.\n\n\"You'll soon get used to it,\"  Miss Hinkle assured her.  \"And\nyou'll learn to show off the dresses and cloaks to the best\nadvantage.\"  She laughed her insinuating little laugh again,\namused, cynical, reckless.  \"You know, the buyers are men.\nGee, what awful jay things we work off on them, sometimes!\nThey can't see the dress for the figure.  And you've got such\na refined figure, Miss Sackville--the kind I'd be crazy about\nif I was a man.  But I must say----\" here she eyed herself in\nthe glass complacently--\"most men prefer a figure like mine.\nDon't they, Miss Simmons?\"\n\nThe stock keeper shook her fat shoulders in a gesture of\nindifferent disdain.  \"They take whatever's handiest--that's\n_my_ experience.\"\n\nAbout half-past nine the first customer appeared--Mr. Gideon,\nit happened to be.  He was making the rounds of the big\nwholesale houses in search of stock for the huge Chicago\ndepartment store that paid him fifteen thousand a year and\nexpenses.  He had been contemptuous of the offerings of\nJeffries and Jonas for the winter season, had praised with\nenthusiasm the models of their principal rival, Icklemeier,\nSchwartz and Company.  They were undecided whether he was\nreally thinking of deserting them or was feeling for lower\nprices.  Mr. Jeffries bustled into the room where Susan stood\nwaiting; his flat face quivered with excitement.  \"Gid's come!\"\nhe said in a hoarse whisper.  \"Everybody get busy.  We'll try\nMiss Sackville on him.\"\n\nAnd he himself assisted while they tricked out Susan in an\nafternoon costume of pale gray, putting on her head a big pale\ngray hat with harmonizing feathers.  The model was offered in\nall colors and also in a modified form that permitted its use\nfor either afternoon or evening.  Susan had received her\ninstructions, so when she was dressed, she was ready to sweep\ninto Gideon's presence with languid majesty.  Jeffries' eyes\nglistened as he noted her walk.  \"She looks as if she really\nwas a lady!\" exclaimed he.  \"I wish I could make my daughters\nmove around on their trotters like that.\"\n\nGideon was enthroned in an easy chair, smoking a cigar.  He was\na spare man of perhaps forty-five, with no intention of\nabandoning the pretensions to youth for many a year.  In dress\nhe was as spick and span as a tailor at the trade's annual\nconvention.  But he had evidently been \"going some\" for several\ndays; the sour, worn, haggard face rising above his elegantly\nfitting collar suggested a moth-eaten jaguar that has been for\nweeks on short rations or none.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he snapped, as the door began to open.\n\"I don't like to be kept waiting.\"\n\nIn swept Susan; and Jeffries, rubbing his thick hands, said\nfawningly, \"But I think, Mr. Gideon, you'll say it was worth\nwaiting for.\"\n\nGideon's angry, arrogant eyes softened at first glimpse of\nSusan.  \"Um!\" he grunted, some such sound as the jaguar\naforesaid would make when the first chunk of food hurtled\nthrough the bars and landed on his paws.  He sat with cigar\npoised between his long white fingers while Susan walked up and\ndown before him, displaying the dress at all angles, Jeffries\nexpatiating upon it the while.\n\n\"Don't talk so damn much, Jeff!\" he commanded with the\ninsolence of a customer containing possibilities of large\nprofit.  \"I judge for myself.  I'm not a damn fool.\"\n\n\"I should say not,\" cried Jeffries, laughing the merchant's\nlaugh for a customer's pleasantry.  \"But I can't help talking\nabout it, Gid, it's so lovely!\"\n\nJeffries' shrewd eyes leaped for joy when Gideon got up from\nhis chair and, under pretense of examining the garment,\ninvestigated Susan's figure.  As his gentle, insinuating hands\ntraveled over her, his eyes sought hers.  \"Excuse me,\" said\nJeffries.  \"I'll see that they get the other things ready.\"\nAnd out he went, winking at Mary Hinkle to follow him--an\nunnecessary gesture as she was already on her way to the door.\n\nGideon understood as well as did they why they left.  \"I don't\nthink I've seen you before, my dear,\" said he to Susan.\n\n\"I came only this morning,\" replied she.\n\n\"I like to know everybody I deal with.  We must get better\nacquainted.  You've got the best figure in the business--the\nvery best.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Susan with a grave, distant smile.\n\n\"Got a date for dinner tonight?\" inquired he; and, assuming\nthat everything would yield precedence to him, he did not wait\nfor a reply, but went on, \"Tell me your address.  I'll send a\ncab for you at seven o'clock.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Susan, \"but I can't go.\"\n\nGideon smiled.  \"Oh, don't be shy.  Of course you'll go.  Ask\nJeffries.  He'll tell you it's all right.\"\n\n\"There are reasons why I'd rather not be seen in the restaurants.\"\n\n\"That's even better.  I'll come in the cab myself and we'll go\nto a quiet place.\"\n\nHis eyes smiled insinuatingly at her.  Now that she looked at\nhim more carefully he was unusually attractive for a man of his\ntype--had strength and intelligence in his features, had a\nsuggestion of mastery, of one used to obedience, in his voice.\nHis teeth were even and sound, his lips firm yet not too thin.\n\n\"Come,\" said he persuasively.  \"I'll not eat you up--\" with a\ngay and gracious smile--\"at least I'll try not to.\"\n\nSusan remembered what Miss Hinkle had told her.  She saw that\nshe must either accept the invitation or give up her position.\nShe said:\n\n\"Very well,\" and gave him her address.\n\nBack came Jeffries and Miss Hinkle carrying the first of the\nwraps.  Gideon waved them away.  \"You've shown 'em to me\nbefore,\" said he.  \"I don't want to see 'em again.  Give me\nthe evening gowns.\"\n\nSusan withdrew, soon to appear in a dress that left her arms\nand neck bare.  Gideon could not get enough of this.  Jeffries\nkept her walking up and down until she was ready to drop with\nweariness of the monotony, of the distasteful play of Gideon's\nfiery glance upon her arms and shoulders and throat.  Gideon\ntried to draw her into conversation, but she would--indeed\ncould--go no further than direct answers to his direct\nquestions.  \"Never mind,\" said he to her in an undertone.\n\"I'll cheer you up this evening.  I think I know how to order\na dinner.\"\n\nHer instant conquest of the difficult and valuable Gideon so\nelated Jeffries that he piled the work on her.  He used her\nwith every important buyer who came that day.  The temperature\nwas up in the high nineties, the hot moist air stood stagnant\nas a barnyard pool; the winter models were cruelly hot and\nheavy.  All day long, with a pause of half an hour to eat her\nroll and drink a glass of water, Susan walked up and down the\nshow parlors weighted with dresses and cloaks, furs for arctic\nweather.  The other girls, even those doing almost nothing,\nwere all but prostrated.  It was little short of intolerable,\nthis struggle to gain the \"honest, self-respecting living by\nhonest work\" that there was so much talk about.  Toward five\no'clock her nerves abruptly and completely gave way, and she\nfainted--for the first time in her life.  At once the whole\nestablishment was in an uproar.  Jeffries cursed himself loudly\nfor his shortsightedness, for his overestimating her young\nstrength.  \"She'll look like hell this evening,\" he wailed,\nwringing his hands like a distracted peasant woman.  \"Maybe she\nwon't be able to go out at all.\"\n\nShe soon came round.  They brought her whiskey, and afterward\ntea and sandwiches.  And with the power of quick recuperation\nthat is the most fascinating miracle of healthy youth, she not\nonly showed no sign of her breakdown but looked much better.\nAnd she felt better.  We shall some day understand why it is\nthat if a severe physical blow follows upon a mental blow,\nrecovery from the physical blow is always accompanied by a\nrelief of the mental strain.  Susan came out of her fit of\nfaintness and exhaustion with a different point of view--as if\ntime had been long at work softening her, grief.  Spenser\nseemed part of the present no longer, but of the past--a past\nfar more remote than yesterday.\n\nMary Hinkle sat with her as she drank the tea.  \"Did you make\na date with Gid?\" inquired she.  Her tone let Susan know that\nthe question had been prompted by Jeffries.\n\n\"He asked me to dine with him, and I said I would.\"\n\n\"Have you got a nice dress--dinner dress, I mean?\"\n\n\"The linen one I'm wearing is all.  My other dress is for\ncooler weather.\"\n\n\"Then I'll give you one out of stock--I mean I'll borrow one\nfor you.  This dinner's a house affair, you know--to get Gid's\norder.  It'll be worth thousands to them.\"\n\n\"There wouldn't be anything to fit me on such short notice,\"\nsaid Susan, casting about for an excuse for not wearing\nborrowed finery.\n\n\"Why, you've got a model figure.  I'll pick you out a white\ndress--and a black and white hat.  I know 'em all, and I know\none that'll make you look simply lovely.\"\n\nSusan did not protest.  She was profoundly indifferent to what\nhappened to her.  Life seemed a show in which she had no part,\nand at which she sat a listless spectator.  A few minutes, and in\npuffed Jeffries, solicitous as a fussy old bird with a new family.\n\n\"You're a lot better, ain't you?\" cried he, before he had\nlooked at her.  \"Oh, yes, you'll be all right.  And you'll have\na lovely time with Mr. Gideon.  He's a perfect gentleman--knows\nhow to treat a lady.  .  .  .  The minute I laid eyes on you I\nsaid to myself, said I, 'Jeffries, she's a mascot.'  And you\nare, my dear.  You'll get us the order.  But you mustn't talk\nbusiness with him, you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan, wearily.\n\n\"He's a gentleman, you know, and it don't do to mix business\nand social pleasures.  You string him along quiet and ladylike\nand elegant, as if there wasn't any such things as cloaks or\ndresses in the world.  He'll understand all right.  .  .  .  If\nyou land the order, my dear, I'll see that you get a nice\npresent.  A nice dress--the one we're going to lend you--if he\ngives us a slice.  The dress and twenty-five in cash, if he\ngives us all.  How's that?\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Susan.  \"I'll do my best.\"\n\n\"You'll land it.  You'll land it.  I feel as if we had it with\nhis O. K. on it.\"\n\nSusan shivered.  \"Don't--don't count on me too much,\" she said\nhesitatingly.  \"I'm not in very good spirits, I'm sorry to say.\"\n\n\"A little pressed for money?\"  Jeffries hesitated, made an\neffort, blurted out what was for him, the business man, a giddy\ngenerosity.  \"On your way out, stop at the cashier's.  He'll\ngive you this week's pay in advance.\"  Jeffries hesitated,\ndecided against dangerous liberality.  \"Not ten, you\nunderstand, but say six.  You see, you won't have been with us\na full week.\"  And he hurried away, frightened by his prodigality,\nby these hysterical impulses that were rushing him far from the\ncourse of sound business sense.  \"As Jones says, I'm a generous\nold fool,\" he muttered.  \"My soft heart'll ruin me yet.\"\n\nJeffries sent Mary Hinkle home with Susan to carry the dress\nand hat, to help her make a toilet and to \"start her off\nright.\"  In the hour before they left the store there was\noffered a typical illustration of why and how \"business\" is\nable to suspend the normal moral sense and to substitute for it\na highly ingenious counterfeit of supreme moral obligation to\nit.  The hysterical Jeffries had infected the entire personnel\nwith his excitement, with the sense that a great battle was\nimpending and that the cause of the house, which was the cause\nof everyone who drew pay from it, had been intrusted to the\nyoung recruit with the fascinating figure and the sweet, sad\nface.  And Susan's sensitive nature was soon vibrating in\nresponse to this feeling.  It terrified her that she, the\ninexperienced, had such grave responsibility.  It made her\nheart heavy to think of probable failure, when the house had\nbeen so good to her, had taken her in, had given her unusual\nwages, had made it possible for her to get a start in life, had\nintrusted to her its cause, its chance to retrieve a bad season\nand to protect its employees instead of discharging a lot of them.\n\n\"Have you got long white gloves?\" asked Mary Hinkle, as they\nwalked up Broadway, she carrying the dress and Susan the hat box.\n\n\"Only a few pairs of short ones.\"\n\n\"You must have long white gloves--and a pair of white stockings.\"\n\n\"I can't afford them.\"\n\n\"Oh, Jeffries told me to ask you--and to go to work and buy\nthem if you hadn't.\"\n\nThey stopped at Wanamaker's.  Susan was about to pay, when Mary\nstopped her.  \"If you pay,\" said she, \"maybe you'll get your\nmoney back from the house, and maybe you won't.  If I pay,\nthey'll not make a kick on giving it back to me.\"\n\nThe dress Mary had selected was a simple white batiste, cut out\nat the neck prettily, and with the elbow sleeves that were then\nthe fashion.  \"Your arms and throat are lovely,\" said Mary.\n\"And your hands are mighty nice, too--that's why I'm sure\nyou've never been a real working girl--leastways, not for a\nlong time.  When you get to the restaurant and draw off your\ngloves in a slow, careless, ladylike kind of way, and put your\nelbows on the table--my, how he will take on!\"  Mary looked at\nher with an intense but not at all malignant envy.  \"If you don't\nland high, it'll be because you're a fool.  And you ain't that.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I am,\" replied Susan.  \"Yes, I guess I'm what's\ncalled a fool--what probably is a fool.\"\n\n\"You want to look out then,\" warned Miss Hinkle.  \"You want to\ngo to work and get over that.  Beauty don't count, unless a\ngirl's got shrewdness.  The streets are full of beauties\nsellin' out for a bare living.  They thought they couldn't help\nwinning, and they got left, and the plain girls who had to\nhustle and manage have passed them.  Go to Del's or Rector's or\nthe Waldorf or the Madrid or any of those high-toned places,\nand see the women with the swell clothes and jewelry!  The\nmarried ones, and the other kind, both.  Are they raving\ntearing beauties?  Not often.  .  .  .  The trouble with me is\nI've been too good-hearted and too soft about being flattered.\nI was too good looking, and a small easy living came too easy.\nYou--I'd say you were--that you had brains but were shy about\nusing them.  What's the good of having them?  Might as well be\na boob.  Then, too, you've got to go to work and look out about\nbeing too refined.  The refined, nice ones goes the lowest--if\nthey get pushed--and this is a pushing world.  You'll get\npushed just as far as you'll let 'em.  Take it from me.  I've\nbeen down the line.\"\n\nSusan's low spirits sank lower.  These disagreeable truths--for\nobservation and experience made her fear they were\ntruths--filled her with despondency.  What was the matter with\nlife?  As between the morality she had been taught and the\npractical morality of this world upon which she had been\ncast, which was the right?  How \"take hold\"?  How avert the\nimpending disaster?  What of the \"good\" should--_must_--she\nthrow away?  What should--_must_--she cling to?\n\nMary Hinkle was shocked by the poor little room.  \"This is no\nplace for a lady!\" cried she.  \"But it won't last long--not\nafter tonight, if you play your cards halfway right.\"\n\n\"I'm very well satisfied,\" said Susan.  \"If I can only keep this!\"\n\nShe felt no interest in the toilet until the dress and hat were\nunpacked and laid out upon the bed.  At sight of them her eyes\nbecame a keen and lively gray--never violet for that kind of\nemotion--and there surged up the love of finery that dwells in\nevery normal woman--and in every normal man--that is put there\nby a heredity dating back through the ages to the very\nbeginning of conscious life--and does not leave them until life\ngives up the battle and prepares to vacate before death.\nEllen, the maid, passing the door, saw and entered to add her\necstatic exclamations to the excitement.  Down she ran to bring\nMrs. Tucker, who no sooner beheld the glory displayed upon the\nhumble bed than she too was in a turmoil.  Susan dressed with\nthe aid of three maids as interested and eager as ever robed a\nqueen for coronation.  Ellen brought hot water and a larger\nbowl.  Mrs. Tucker wished to lend a highly scented toilet soap\nshe used when she put on gala attire; but Susan insisted upon\nher own plain soap.  They all helped her bathe; they helped her\nselect the best underclothes from her small store.  Susan would\nput on her own stockings; but Ellen got one foot into one of\nthe slippers and Mrs. Tucker looked after the other foot.\n\"Ain't they lovely?\" said Ellen to Mrs. Tucker, as they knelt\ntogether at their task.  \"I never see such feet.  Not a lump on\n'em, but like feet in a picture.\"\n\n\"It takes a mighty good leg to look good in a white stocking,\"\nobserved Mary.  \"But yours is so nice and long and slim that\nthey'd stand most anything.\"\n\nMrs. Tucker and Ellen stood by with no interference save\nsuggestion and comment, while Mary, who at one time worked for\na hairdresser, did Susan's thick dark hair.  Susan would permit\nno elaborations, much to Miss Hinkle's regret.  But the three\nagreed that she was right when the simple sweep of the vital\nblue-black hair was finished in a loose and graceful knot at\nthe back, and Susan's small, healthily pallid face looked its\nloveliest, with the violet-gray eyes soft and sweet and\nserious.  Mrs. Tucker brought the hat from the bed, and Susan\nput it on--a large black straw of a most becoming shape with\ntwo pure white plumes curling round the crown and a third, not\nso long, rising gracefully from the big buckle where the three\nplumes met.  And now came the putting on of the dress.  With as\nmuch care as if they were handling a rare and fragile vase,\nMary and Mrs. Tucker held the dress for Susan to step into it.\nEllen kept her petticoat in place while the other two escorted\nthe dress up Susan's form.\n\nThen the three worked together at hooking and smoothing.  Susan\nwashed her hands again, refused to let Mrs. Tucker run and\nbring powder, produced from a drawer some prepared chalk and\nwith it safeguarded her nose against shine; she tucked the\npowder rag into her stocking.  Last of all the gloves went on and\na small handkerchief was thrust into the palm of the left glove.\n\n\"How do I look?\" asked Susan.  \"Lovely\"--\"Fine\"--\"Just grand,\"\nexclaimed the three maids.\n\n\"I feel awfully dressed up,\" said she.  \"And it's so hot!\"\n\n\"You must go right downstairs where it's cool and you won't get\nwilted,\" cried Mrs. Tucker.  \"Hold your skirts close on the\nway.  The steps and walls ain't none too clean.\"\n\nIn the bathroom downstairs there was a long mirror built into\nthe wall, a relic of the old house's long departed youth of\ngrandeur.  As the tenant--Mr. Jessop--was out, Mrs. Tucker led\nthe way into it.  There Susan had the first satisfactory look\nat herself.  She knew she was a pretty woman; she would have\nbeen weak-minded had she not known it.  But she was amazed at\nherself.  A touch here and there, a sinuous shifting of the\nbody within the garments, and the suggestion of \"dressed up\"\nvanished before the reflected eyes of her agitated assistants,\nwho did not know what had happened but only saw the results.\nShe hardly knew the tall beautiful woman of fashion gazing at\nher from the mirror.  Could it be that this was her\nhair?--these eyes hers--and the mouth and nose and the skin?\nWas this long slender figure her very own?  What an astounding\ndifference clothes did make!  Never before had Susan worn\nanything nearly so fine.  \"This is the way I ought to look all\nthe time,\" thought she.  \"And this is the way I _will_ look!\"\nOnly better--much better.  Already her true eye was seeing the\ndefects, the chances for improvement--how the hat could be\nre-bent and re-trimmed to adapt it to her features, how the\ndress could be altered to make it more tasteful, more effective\nin subtly attracting attention to her figure.\n\n\"How much do you suppose the dress cost, Miss Hinkle?\" asked\nEllen--the question Mrs. Tucker had been dying to put but had\nrefrained from putting lest it should sound unrefined.\n\n\"It costs ninety wholesale,\" said Miss Hinkle.  \"That'd mean a\nhundred and twenty-five--a hundred and fifty, maybe if you was\nto try to buy it in a department store.  And the hat--well,\nLichtenstein'd ask fifty or sixty for it and never turn a hair.\"\n\n\"Gosh--ee?\" exclaimed Ellen.  \"Did you ever hear the like?\"\n\n\"I'm not surprised,\" said Mrs. Tucker, who in fact was\nflabbergasted.  \"Well--it's worth the money to them that can\nafford to buy it.  The good Lord put everything on earth to be\nused, I reckon.  And Miss Sackville is the build for things\nlike that.  Now it'd be foolish on me, with a stomach and\nsitter that won't let no skirt hang fit to look at.\"\n\nThe bell rang.  The excitement died from Susan's face, leaving\nit pale and cold.  A wave of nausea swept through her.  Ellen\npeeped out, Mrs. Tucker and Miss Hinkle listening with anxious\nfaces.  \"It's him!\" whispered Ellen, \"and there's a taxi, too.\"\n\nIt was decided that Ellen should go to the door, that as she\nopened it Susan should come carelessly from the back room and\nadvance along the hall.  And this program was carried out with\nthe result that as Gideon said, \"Is Miss Sackville here?\" Miss\nSackville appeared before his widening, wondering, admiring\neyes.  He was dressed in the extreme of fashion and costliness\nin good taste; while it would have been impossible for him to\nlook distinguished, he did look what he was--a prosperous\nbusiness man with prospects.  He came perfumed and rustling.\nBut he felt completely outclassed--until he reminded himself\nthat for all her brave show of fashionable lady she was only a\nmodel while he was a fifteen-thousand-a-year man on the way to\na partnership.\n\n\"Don't you think we might dine on the veranda at Sherry's?\"\nsuggested he.  \"It'd be cool there.\"\n\nAt sight of him she had nerved herself, had keyed herself up\ntoward recklessness.  She was in for it.  She would put it\nthrough.  No futile cowardly shrinking and whimpering!  Why not\ntry to get whatever pleasure there was a chance for?\nBut--Sherry's--was it safe?  Yes, almost any of the Fifth\nAvenue places--except the Waldorf, possibly--was safe enough.\nThe circuit of Spenser and his friends lay in the more Bohemian\nBroadway district.  He had taken her to Sherry's only once, to\nsee as part of a New York education the Sunday night crowd of\nfashionable people.  \"If you like,\" said she.\n\nGideon beamed.  He would be able to show off his prize!  As\nthey drove away Susan glanced at the front parlor windows, saw\nthe curtains agitated, felt the three friendly, excited faces\npalpitating.  She leaned from the cab window, waved her hand,\nsmiled.  The three faces instantly appeared and immediately hid\nagain lest Gideon should see.\n\nBut Gideon was too busy planning conversation.  He knew Miss\nSackville was \"as common as the rest of 'em--and an old hand at\nthe business, no doubt.\"  But he simply could not abruptly\nbreak through the barrier; he must squirm through gradually.\n\"That's a swell outfit you've got on,\" he began.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Susan with her usual candor.  \"Miss Hinkle\nborrowed it out of the stock for me to wear.\"\n\nGideon was confused.  He knew how she had got the hat and\ndress, but he expected her to make a pretense.  He couldn't\nunderstand her not doing it.  Such candor--any kind of\ncandor--wasn't in the game of men and women as women had played\nit in his experience.  The women--all sorts of women--lied and\nfaked at their business just as men did in the business of\nbuying and selling goods.  And her voice--and her way of\nspeaking--they made him feel more than ever out of his class.\nHe must get something to drink as soon as it could be served;\nthat would put him at his ease.  Yes--a drink--that would set\nhim up again.  And a drink for her--that would bring her down\nfrom this queer new kind of high horse.  \"I guess she must be\na top notcher--the real thing, come down in the world--and not\nout of the near silks.  But she'll be all right after a drink.\nOne drink of liquor makes the whole world kin.\"  That last\nthought reminded him of his own cleverness and he attacked the\nsituation afresh.  But the conversation as they drove up the\navenue was on the whole constrained and intermittent--chiefly\nabout the weather.  Susan was observing--and feeling--and\nenjoying.  Up bubbled her young spirits perpetually renewed by\nher healthy, vital youth of body.  She was seeing her beloved\nCity of the Sun again.  As they turned out of the avenue for\nSherry's main entrance Susan realized that she was in\nForty-fourth Street.  The street where she and Spenser had\nlived!--had lived only yesterday.  No--not yesterday--impossible!\nHer eyes closed and she leaned back in the cab.\n\nGideon was waiting to help her alight.  He saw that something\nwas wrong; it stood out obviously in her ghastly face.  He\nfeared the carriage men round the entrance would \"catch on\" to\nthe fact that he was escorting a girl so unused to swell\nsurroundings that she was ready to faint with fright.  \"Don't\nbe foolish,\" he said sharply.  Susan revived herself,\ndescended, and with head bent low and trembling body entered\nthe restaurant.  In the agitation of getting a table and\nsettling at it Gideon forgot for the moment her sickly pallor.\n\nHe began to order at once, not consulting her--for he prided\nhimself on his knowledge of cookery and assumed that she knew\nnothing about it.  \"Have a cocktail?\" asked he.  \"Yes, of\ncourse you will.  You need it bad and you need it quick.\"\n\nShe said she preferred sherry.  She had intended to drink\nnothing, but she must have aid in conquering her faintness and\noverwhelming depression.  Gideon took a dry martini; ordered a\nsecond for himself when the first came, and had them both down\nbefore she finished her sherry.  \"I've ordered champagne,\" said\nhe.  \"I suppose you like sweet champagne.  Most ladies do, but\nI can't stand seeing it served even.\"\n\n\"No--I like it very dry,\" said Susan.\n\nGideon glinted his eyes gayly at her, showed his white jaguar\nteeth.  \"So you're acquainted with fizz, are you?\" He was\nfeeling his absurd notion of inequality in her favor dissipate\nas the fumes of the cocktails rose straight and strong from his\nempty stomach to his brain.  \"Do you know, I've a sort of\nfeeling that we're going to like each other a lot.  I think we\nmake a handsome couple--eh--what's your first name?\"\n\n\"Lorna.\"\n\n\"Lorna, then.  My name's Ed, but everybody calls me Gid.\"\n\nAs soon as the melon was served, he ordered the champagne\nopened.  \"To our better acquaintance,\" said he, lifting his\nglass toward her.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said she, in a suffocated voice, touching her\nglass to her lips.\n\nHe was too polite to speak, even in banter, of what he thought\nwas the real cause of her politeness and silence.  But he must\nend this state of overwhelmedness at grand surroundings.  Said he:\n\n\"You're kind o' shy, aren't you, Lorna?  Or is that your game?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  You've had a very interesting life, haven't\nyou?  Won't you tell me about it?\"\n\n\"Oh--just ordinary,\" replied he, with a proper show of modesty.\nAnd straightway, as Susan had hoped, he launched into a minute\naccount of himself--the familiar story of the energetic,\naggressive man twisting and kicking his way up from two or\nthree dollars a week.  Susan seemed interested, but her mind\nrefused to occupy itself with a narrative so commonplace.\nAfter Rod and his friends this boastful business man was dull\nand tedious.  Whenever he laughed at an account of his superior\ncraft--how he had bluffed this man, how he had euchered that\none--she smiled.  And so in one more case the common masculine\ndelusion that women listen to them on the subject of\nthemselves, with interest and admiration as profound as their\nown, was not impaired.\n\n\"But,\" he wound up, \"I've stayed plain Ed Gideon.  I never have\nlet prosperity swell _my_ head.  And anyone that knows me'll\ntell you I'm a regular fool for generosity with those that come\nat me right.  .  .  .  I've always been a favorite with the ladies.\"\n\nAs he was pausing for comment from her, she said, \"I can\nbelieve it.\"  The word \"generosity\" kept echoing in her mind.\nGenerosity--generosity.  How much talk there was about it!\nEveryone was forever praising himself for his generosity, was\nreciting acts of the most obvious selfishness in proof.  Was\nthere any such thing in the whole world as real generosity?\n\n\"They like a generous man,\" pursued Gid.  \"I'm tight in\nbusiness--I can see a dollar as far as the next man and chase\nit as hard and grab it as tight.  But when it comes to the\nladies, why, I'm open-handed.  If they treat me right, I treat\nthem right.\"  Then, fearing that he had tactlessly raised a\ndoubt of his invincibility, he hastily added, \"But they always\ndo treat me right.\"\n\nWhile he had been talking on and on, Susan had been appealing\nto the champagne to help her quiet her aching heart.  She\nresolutely set her thoughts to wandering among the couples at\nthe other tables in that subdued softening light--the\nbeautifully dressed women listening to their male companions\nwith close attention--were they too being bored by such trash\nby way of talk?  Were they too simply listening because it is\nthe man who pays, because it is the man who must be conciliated\nand put in a good humor with himself, if dinners and dresses\nand jewels are to be bought?  That tenement attic--that hot\nmoist workroom--poverty--privation--\"honest work's\" dread\nrewards----\n\n\"Now, what kind of a man would you say I was?\" Gideon was inquiring.\n\n\"How do you mean?\" replied Susan, with the dexterity at vagueness\nthat habitually self-veiling people acquire as an instinct.\n\n\"Why, as a man.  How do I compare with the other men you've\nknown?\"  And he \"shot\" his cuffs with a gesture of careless\nelegance that his cuff links might assist in the picture of the\n\"swell dresser\" he felt he was posing.\n\n\"Oh--you--you're--very different.\"\n\n\"I _am_ different,\" swelled Gideon.  \"You see, it's this\nway----\" And he was off again into another eulogy of himself;\nit carried them through the dinner and two quarts of champagne.\nHe was much annoyed that she did not take advantage of the\npointed opportunity he gave her to note the total of the bill;\nhe was even uncertain whether she had noted that he gave the\nwaiter a dollar.  He rustled and snapped it before laying it\nupon the tray, but her eyes looked vague.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, after a comfortable pull at an\nexpensive-looking cigar, \"sixteen seventy-five is quite a\nlively little peel-off for a dinner for only two.  But it was\nworth it, don't you think?\"\n\n\"It was a splendid dinner,\" said Susan truthfully.\nGideon beamed in intoxicated good humor.  \"I knew you'd like\nit.  Nothing pleases me better than to take a nice girl who\nisn't as well off as I am out and blow her off to a crackerjack\ndinner.  Now, you may have thought a dollar was too much to tip\nthe waiter?\"\n\n\"A dollar is--a dollar, isn't it?\" said Susan.\n\nGideon laughed.  \"I used to think so.  And most men wouldn't\ngive that much to a waiter.  But I feel sorry for poor devils\nwho don't happen to be as lucky or as brainy as I am.  What do\nyou say to a turn in the Park?  We'll take a hansom, and kind\nof jog along.  And we'll stop at the Casino and at Gabe's for\na drink.\"\n\n\"I have to get up so early,\" began Susan.\n\n\"Oh, that's all right.\"  He slowly winked at her.  \"You'll not\nhave to bump the bumps for being late tomorrow--if you treat\n_me_ right.\"\n\nHe carried his liquor easily.  Only in his eyes and in his ever\nmore slippery smile that would slide about his face did he show\nthat he had been drinking.  He helped her into a hansom with a\nflourish and, overruling her protests, bade the driver go to\nthe Casino.  Once under way she was glad; her hot skin and her\nweary heart were grateful for the air blowing down the avenue\nfrom the Park's expanse of green.  When Gideon attempted to put\nhis arm around her, she moved close into the corner and went on\ntalking so calmly about calm subjects that he did not insist.\nBut when he had tossed down a drink of whiskey at the Casino\nand they resumed the drive along the moonlit, shady roads, he\ntried again.\n\n\"Please,\" said she, \"don't spoil a delightful evening.\"\n\n\"Now look here, my dear--haven't I treated you right?\"\n\n\"Indeed you have, Mr. Gideon.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't be so damned formal.  Forget the difference between\nour positions.  Tomorrow I'm going to place a big order with\nyour house, if you treat me right.  I'm dead stuck on you--and\nthat's a God's fact.  You've taken me clean off my feet.  I'm\nthinking of doing a lot for you.\"\n\nSusan was silent.\n\n\"What do you say to throwing up your job and coming to Chicago\nwith me?  How much do you get?\"\n\n\"Ten.\"\n\n\"Why, _you_ can't live on that.\"\n\n\"I've lived on less--much less.\"\n\n\"Do you like it?\"\n\n\"Naturally not.\"\n\n\"You want to get on--don't you?\"\n\n\"I must.\"\n\n\"You're down in the heart about something.  Love?\"\n\nSusan was silent.\n\n\"Cut love out.  Cut it out, my dear.  That ain't the way to get\non.  Love's a good consolation prize, if you ain't going to get\nanywhere, and know you ain't.  And it's a good first prize\nafter you've arrived and can afford the luxuries of life.  But\nfor a man--or a woman--that's pushing up, it's sheer ruination!\nCut it out!\"\n\n\"I am cutting it out,\" said Susan.  \"But that takes time.\"\n\n\"Not if you've got sense.  The way to cut anything out is--cut\nit out!--a quick slash--just cut.  If you make a dozen little\nslashes, each of them hurts as much as the one big slash--and\nthe dozen hurt twelve times as much--bleed twelve times as\nmuch--put off the cure a lot more than twelve times as long.\"\n\nHe had Susan's attention for the first time.\n\n\"Do you know why women don't get on?\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" said she.  \"That's what I want to hear.\"\n\n\"Because they don't play the game under the rules.  Now, what\ndoes a man do?  Why, he stakes everything he's got--does\nwhatever's necessary, don't stop at _nothing_ to help him get\nthere.  How is it with women?  Some try to be virtuous--when\ntheir bodies are their best assets.  God!  I wish I'd 'a' had\nyour looks and your advantages as a woman to help me.  I'd be\na millionaire this minute, with a house facing this Park and a\nyacht and all the rest of it.  A woman that's squeamish about\nher virtue can't hope to win--unless she's in a position to\nmake a good marriage.  As for the loose ones, they are as big\nfools as the virtuous ones.  The virtuous ones lock away their\nbest asset; the loose ones throw it away.  Neither one _use_ it.\nDo you follow me?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"  Susan was listening with a mind made abnormally\nacute by the champagne she had freely drunk.  The coarse\nbluntness and directness of the man did not offend her.  It\nmade what he said the more effective, producing a rude\narresting effect upon her nerves.  It made the man himself seem\nmore of a person.  Susan was beginning to have a kind of\nrespect for him, to change her first opinion that he was merely\na vulgar, pushing commonplace.\n\n\"Never thought of that before?\"\n\n\"Yes--I've thought of it.  But----\" She paused.\n\n\"But--what?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing.\"\n\n\"Never mind.  Some womanish heart nonsense, I suppose.  Do you\nsee the application of what I've said to you and me?\"\n\n\"Go on.\"  She was leaning forward, her elbows on the closed\ndoors of the hansom, her eyes gazing dreamily into the moonlit\ndimness of the cool woods through which they were driving.\n\n\"You don't want to stick at ten per?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It'll be less in a little while.  Models don't last.  The\nwork's too hard.\"\n\n\"I can see that.\"\n\n\"And anyhow it means tenement house.\"\n\n\"Yes.  Tenement house.\"\n\n\"Well--what then?  What's your plan?\"\n\n\"I haven't any.\"\n\n\"Haven't a plan--yet want to get on!  Is that good sense?\nDid ever anybody get anywhere without a plan?\"\n\n\"I'm willing to work.  I'm going to work.  I _am_ working.\"\n\n\"Work, of course.  Nobody can keep alive without working.  You\nmight as well say you're going to breathe and eat--Work don't\namount to anything, for getting on.  It's the kind of\nwork--working in a certain direction--working with a plan.\"\n\n\"I've got a plan.  But I can't begin at it just yet.\"\n\n\"Will it take money?\"\n\n\"Some.\"\n\n\"Have you got it?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Susan.  \"I'll have to get it.\"\n\n\"As an honest working girl?\" said he with good-humored irony.\n\nSusan laughed.  \"It does sound ridiculous, doesn't it?\" said she.\n\n\"Here's another thing that maybe you haven't counted in.\nLooking as you do, do you suppose men that run things'll let\nyou get past without paying toll?  Not on your life, my dear.\nIf you was ugly, you might after several years get twenty or\ntwenty-five by working hard--unless you lost your figure first.\nBut the men won't let a good looker rise that way.  Do you\nfollow me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I'm not talking theory.  I'm talking life.  Take you and me\nfor example.  I can help you--help you a lot.  In fact I can\nput you on your feet.  And I'm willing.  If you was a man and\nI liked you and wanted to help you, I'd make you help me, too.\nI'd make you do a lot of things for me--maybe some of 'em not\nso very nice--maybe some of 'em downright dirty.  And you'd do\n'em, as all young fellows, struggling up, have to.  But you're\na woman.  So I'm willing to make easier terms.  But I can't\nhelp you with you not showing any appreciation.  That wouldn't\nbe good business--would it?--to get no return but, 'Oh, thank\nyou so much, Mr. Gideon.  So sweet of you.  I'll remember you\nin my prayers.'  Would that be sensible?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Well, then!  If I do you a good turn, you've got to do me a\ngood turn--not one that I don't want done, but one I do want\ndone.  Ain't I right?  Do you follow me?\"\n\n\"I follow you.\"\n\nSome vague accent in Susan's voice made him feel dissatisfied\nwith her response.  \"I hope you do,\" he said sharply.  \"What\nI'm saying is dresses on your back and dollars in your\npocket--and getting on in the world--if you work it right.\"\n\n\"Getting on in the world,\" said Susan, pensively.\n\n\"I suppose that's a sneer.\"\n\n\"Oh, no.  I was only thinking.\"\n\n\"About love being all a woman needs to make her happy, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No.  Love is--Well, it isn't happiness.\"\n\n\"Because you let it run you, instead of you running it.  Eh?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"Sure!  Now, let me tell you, Lorna dear.  Comfort and luxury,\nmoney in bank, property, a good solid position--_that's_ the\nfoundation.  Build on _that_ and you'll build solid.  Build on\nlove and sentiment and you're building upside down.  You're\nputting the gingerbread where the rock ought to be.  Follow me?\"\n\n\"I see what you mean.\"\n\nHe tried to find her hand.  \"What do you say?\"\n\n\"I'll think of it.\"\n\n\"Well, think quick, my dear.  Opportunity doesn't wait round in\nanybody's outside office .  .  .  Maybe you don't trust\nme--don't think I'll deliver the goods?\"\n\n\"No.  I think you're honest.\"\n\n\"You're right I am.  I do what I say I'll do.  That's why I've got\non.  That's why I'll keep on getting on.  Let's drive to a hotel.\"\n\nShe turned her head and looked at him for the first time since\nhe began his discourse on making one's way in the world.  Her\nlook was calm, inquiring--would have been chilling to a man of\nsensibility--that is, of sensibility toward an unconquered woman.\n\n\"I want to give your people that order, and I want to help you.\"\n\n\"I want them to get the order.  I don't care about the rest,\"\nshe replied dully.\n\n\"Put it any way you like.\"\n\nAgain he tried to embrace her.  She resisted firmly.  \"Wait,\"\nsaid she.  \"Let me think.\"\n\nThey drove the rest of the way to the upper end of the Park\nin silence.\n\nHe ordered the driver to turn.  He said to her; \"Well, do you\nget the sack or does the house get the order?\"\n\nShe was silent.\n\n\"Shall I drive you home or shall we stop at Gabe's for a drink?\"\n\n\"Could I have champagne?\" said she.\n\n\"Anything you like if you choose right.\"\n\n\"I haven't any choice,\" said she.\n\nHe laughed, put his arm around her, kissed her unresponsive but\nunresisting lips.  \"You're right, you haven't,\" said he.  \"It's\na fine sign that you have the sense to see it.  Oh, you'll get\non.  You don't let trifles stand in your way.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nAT the lunch hour the next day Mary Hinkle knocked at the\ngarret in Clinton Place.  Getting no answer, she opened the\ndoor.  At the table close to the window was Susan in a\nnightgown, her hair in disorder as if she had begun to arrange\nit and had stopped halfway.  Her eyes turned listlessly in\nMary's direction--dull eyes, gray, heavily circled.\n\n\"You didn't answer, Miss Sackville.  So I thought I'd come in and\nleave a note,\" explained Mary.  Her glance was avoiding Susan's.\n\n\"Come for the dress and hat?\" said Susan.  \"There they are.\"\nAnd she indicated the undisturbed bed whereon hat and dress\nwere carelessly flung.\n\n\"My, but it's hot in this room!\" exclaimed Mary.  \"You must\nmove up to my place.  There's a room and bath vacant--only\nseven per.\"\n\nSusan seemed not to hear.  She was looking dully at her hands\nupon the table before her.\n\n\"Mr. Jeffries sent me to ask you how you were.  He was worried\nbecause you didn't come.\"  With a change of voice, \"Mr. Gideon\ntelephoned down the order a while ago.  Mr. Jeffries says you\nare to keep the dress and hat.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan.  \"Take them away with you.\"\n\n\"Aren't you coming down this afternoon?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Susan.  \"I've quit.\"\n\n\"Quit?\" cried Miss Hinkle.  Her expression gradually shifted\nfrom astonishment to pleased understanding.  \"Oh, I see!\nYou've got something better.\"\n\n\"No.  But I'll find something.\"\n\nMary studied the situation, using Susan's expressionless face\nas a guide.  After a time she seemed to get from it a clew.\nWith the air of friendly experience bent on aiding helpless\ninexperience she pushed aside the dress and made room for\nherself on the bed.  \"Don't be a fool, Miss Sackville,\" said\nshe.  \"If you don't like that sort of thing--you know what I\nmean--why, you can live six months--maybe a year--on the\nreputation of what you've done and their hope that you'll\nweaken down and do it again.  That'll give you time to look\nround and find something else.  For pity's sake, don't turn\nyourself loose without a job.  You got your place so easy that\nyou think you can get one any old time.  There's where you're\nwrong.  Believe me, you played in luck--and luck don't come\nround often.  I know what I'm talking about.  So I say, don't\nbe a fool!\"\n\n\"I am a fool,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Well--get over it.  And don't waste any time about it, either.\"\n\n\"I can't go back,\" said Susan stolidly.  \"I can't face them.\"\n\n\"Face who?\" cried Mary.  \"Business is business.  Everybody\nunderstands that.  All the people down there are crazy about\nyou now.  You got the house a hundred-thousand-dollar order.\nYou don't _suppose_ anybody in business bothers about how an\norder's got--do you?\"\n\n\"It's the way _I_ feel--not the way _they_ feel.\"\n\n\"As for the women down there--of course, there's some that\npretend they won't do that sort of thing.  Look at 'em--at\ntheir faces and figures--and you'll see why they don't.  Of\ncourse a girl keeps straight when there's nothing in not being\nstraight--leastways, unless she's a fool.  She knows that if\nthe best she can do is marry a fellow of her own class, why\nshe'd only get left if she played any tricks with them cheap\nskates that have to get married or go without because they're\ntoo poor to pay for anything--and by marrying can get that and\na cook and a washwoman and mender besides--and maybe, too,\nsomebody who can go out and work if they're laid up sick.  But\nif a girl sees a chance to get on----don't be a fool, Miss\nSackville.\"\n\nSusan listened with a smile that barely disturbed the stolid\ncalm of her features.  \"I'm not going back,\" she said.\n\nMary Hinkle was silenced by the quiet finality of her voice.\nStudying that delicate face, she felt, behind its pallid\nimpassiveness, behind the refusal to return, a reason she could\nnot comprehend.  She dimly realized that she would respect it\nif she could understand it; for she suspected it had its origin\nsomewhere in Susan's \"refined ladylike nature.\"  She knew that\nonce in a while among the women she was acquainted with there\ndid happen one who preferred death in any form of misery to\nleading a lax life--and indisputable facts had convinced her\nthat not always were these women \"just stupid ignorant fools.\"\nShe herself possessed no such refinement of nerves or of\nwhatever it was.  She had been brought up in a loose family and\nin a loose neighborhood.  She was in the habit of making all\nsorts of pretenses, because that was the custom, while being\ncandid about such matters was regarded as bad form.  She was\nnot fooled by these pretenses in other girls, though they often\ndid fool each other.  In Susan, she instinctively felt, it was\nnot pretense.  It was something or other else--it was a\ndangerous reality.  She liked Susan; in her intelligence and\nphysical charm were the possibilities of getting far up in the\nworld; it seemed a pity that she was thus handicapped.  Still,\nperhaps Susan would stumble upon some worth while man who,\nattempting to possess her without marriage and failing, would\npay the heavy price.  There was always that chance--a small\nchance, smaller even than finding by loose living a worth while\nman who would marry you because you happened exactly to suit\nhim--to give him enough only to make him feel that he wanted\nmore.  Still, Susan was unusually attractive, and luck\nsometimes did come a poor person's way--sometimes.\n\n\"I'm overdue back,\" said Mary.  \"You want me to tell 'em that?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You'll have hard work finding a job at anything like as much\nas ten per.  I've got two trades, and I couldn't at either one.\"\n\n\"I don't expect to find it.\"\n\n\"Then what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Take what I can get--until I've been made hard enough--or\nstrong enough--or whatever it is--to stop being a fool.\"\n\nThis indication of latent good sense relieved Miss Hinkle.\n\"I'll tell 'em you may be down tomorrow.  Think it over for\nanother day.\"\n\nSusan shook her head.  \"They'll have to get somebody else.\"\nAnd, as Miss Hinkle reached the threshold, \"Wait till I do the\ndress up.  You'll take it for me?\"\n\n\"Why send the things back?\" urged Mary.  \"They belong to you.\nGod knows you earned 'em.\"\n\nSusan, standing now, looked down at the finery.  \"So I did.\nI'll keep them,\" said she.  \"They'd pawn for something.\"\n\n\"With your looks they'd wear for a heap more.  But keep 'em,\nanyhow.  And I'll not tell Jeffries you've quit.  It'll do no\nharm to hold your job open a day or so.\"\n\n\"As you like,\" said Susan, to end the discussion.  \"But I have quit.\"\n\n\"No matter.  After you've had something to eat, you'll feel different.\"\n\nAnd Miss Hinkle nodded brightly and departed.  Susan resumed\nher seat at the bare wobbly little table, resumed her listless\nattitude.  She did not move until Ellen came in, holding out a\nnote and saying, \"A boy from your store brung this--here.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Susan, taking the note.  In it she found a\ntwenty-dollar bill and a five.  On the sheet of paper round it\nwas scrawled:\n\n\nTake the day off.  Here's your commission.  We'll raise your\npay in a few weeks,                                   L. L. J.\n\n\nSo Mary Hinkle had told them either that she was quitting or\nthat she was thinking of quitting, and they wished her to stay,\nhad used the means they believed she could not resist.  In a\ndreary way this amused her.  As if she cared whether or not\nlife was kept in this worthless body of hers, in her tired\nheart, in her disgusted mind!  Then she dropped back into\nlistlessness.  When she was aroused again it was by Gideon,\ncompletely filling the small doorway.  \"Hello, my dear!\" cried\nhe cheerfully.  \"Mind my smoking?\"\n\nSusan slowly turned her head toward him, surveyed him with an\nexpression but one removed from the blank look she would have\nhad if there had been no one before her.\n\n\"I'm feeling fine today,\" pursued Gideon, advancing a step and\nso bringing himself about halfway to the table.  \"Had a couple\nof pick-me-ups and a fat breakfast.  How are you?\"\n\n\"I'm always well.\"\n\n\"Thought you seemed a little seedy.\"  His shrewd sensual eyes\nwere exploring the openings in her nightdress.  \"You'll be\nmighty glad to get out of this hole.  Gosh!  It's hot.  Don't\nsee how you stand it.  I'm a law abiding citizen but I must say\nI'd turn criminal before I'd put up with this.\"\n\nIn the underworld from which Gideon had sprung--the underworld\nwhere welters the overwhelming mass of the human race--there\nare three main types.  There are the hopeless and\nspiritless--the mass--who welter passively on, breeding and\ndying.  There are the spirited who also possess both shrewdness\nand calculation; they push upward by hook and by crook, always\nmindful of the futility of the struggle of the petty criminal\nof the slums against the police and the law; they arrive and\nfound the aristocracies of the future.  The third is the\ncriminal class.  It is also made up of the spirited--but the\nspirited who, having little shrewdness and no calculation--that\nis, no ability to foresee and measure consequences--wage clumsy\nwar upon society and pay the penalty of their fatuity in lives\nof wretchedness even more wretched than the common lot.  Gideon\nbelonged to the second class--the class that pushes upward\nwithout getting into jail; he was a fair representative of this\ntype, neither its best nor its worst, but about midway of its\nrange between arrogant, all-dominating plutocrat and shystering\nmerchant or lawyer or politician who barely escapes the\ncriminal class.\n\n\"You don't ask me to sit down, dearie,\" he went on facetiously.\n\"But I'm not so mad that I won't do it.\"\n\nHe took the seat Miss Hinkle had cleared on the bed.  His\nglance wandered disgustedly from object to object in the\ncrowded yet bare attic.  He caught a whiff of the odor from\nacross the hall--from the fresh-air shaft--and hastily gave\nseveral puffs at his cigar to saturate his surroundings with\nits perfume.  Susan acted as if she were alone in the room.\nShe had not even drawn together her nightgown.\n\n\"I phoned your store about you,\" resumed Gideon.  \"They said\nyou hadn't showed up--wouldn't till tomorrow.  So I came round\nhere and your landlady sent me up.  I want to take you for a\ndrive this afternoon.  We can dine up to Claremont or farther,\nif you like.\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Susan.  \"I can't go.\"\n\n\"Upty-tupty!\" cried Gideon.  \"What's the lady so sour about?\"\n\n\"I'm not sour.\"\n\n\"Then why won't you go?\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\n\"But we'll have a chance to talk over what I'm going to do for you.\"\n\n\"You've kept your word,\" said Susan.\n\n\"That was only part.  Besides, I'd have given your house the\norder, anyhow.\"\n\nSusan's eyes suddenly lighted up.  \"You would?\" she cried.\n\n\"Well--a part of it.  Not so much, of course.  But I never let\npleasure interfere with business.  Nobody that does ever gets\nvery far.\"\n\nHer expression made him hasten to explain--without being\nconscious why.  \"I said--_part_ of the order, my dear.  They owe\nto you about half of what they'll make off me.  .  .  .  What's\nthat money on the table?  Your commission?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Twenty-five?  Um!\" Gideon laughed.  \"Well, I suppose it's as\ngenerous as I'd be, in the same circumstances.  Encourage your\nemployees, but don't swell-head 'em--that's the good rule.  I've\nseen many a promising young chap ruined by a raise of pay.  . .  .\nNow, about you and me.\"  Gideon took a roll of bills from\nhis trousers pocket, counted off five twenties, tossed them on\nthe table.  \"There!\"\n\nOne of the bills in falling touched Susan's hand.  She jerked\nthe hand away as if the bill had been afire.  She took all five\nof them, folded them, held them out to him.  \"The house has\npaid me,\" said she.\n\n\"That's honest,\" said he, nodding approvingly.  \"I like it.\nBut in your case it don't apply.\"\n\nThese two, thus facing a practical situation, revealed an\nimportant, overlooked truth about human morals.  Humanity\ndivides broadly into three classes: the arrived; those who will\nnever arrive and will never try; those in a state of flux,\nattempting and either failing or succeeding.  The arrived and\nthe inert together preach and to a certain extent practice an\nidealistic system of morality that interferes with them in no\nway.  It does not interfere with the arrived because they have\nno need to infringe it, except for amusement; it does not\ninterfere with the inert, but rather helps them to bear their\nlot by giving them a cheering notion that their insignificance\nis due to their goodness.  This idealistic system receives the\nhomage of lip service from the third and struggling section of\nmankind, but no more, for in practice it would hamper them at\nevery turn in their efforts to fight their way up.  Susan was,\nat that stage of her career, a candidate for membership in the\nstruggling class.  Her heart was set firmly against the\nunwritten, unspoken, even unwhispered code of practical\nmorality which dominates the struggling class.  But life had at\nleast taught her the folly of intolerance.  So when Gideon\ntalked in terms of that practical morality, she listened\nwithout offense; and she talked to him in terms of it because\nto talk the idealistic morality in which she had been bred and\nbefore which she bowed the knee in sincere belief would have\nbeen simply to excite his laughter at her innocence and his\ncontempt for her folly.\n\n\"I feel that I've been paid,\" said she.  \"I did it for the\nhouse--because I owed it to them.\"\n\n\"Only for the house?\" said he with insinuating tenderness.  He\ntook and pressed the fingers extended with the money in them.\n\n\"Only for the house,\" she repeated, a hard note in her voice.\nAnd her fingers slipped away, leaving the money in his hand.\n\"At least, I suppose it must have been for the house,\" she\nadded, reflectively, talking to herself aloud.  \"Why did I do\nit?  I don't know.  I don't know.  They say one always has a\nreason for what one does.  But I often can't find any reason\nfor things I do--that, for instance.  I simply did it because\nit seemed to me not to matter much what _I_ did with myself,\nand they wanted the order so badly.\"  Then she happened to\nbecome conscious of his presence and to see a look of\nuneasiness, self-complacence, as if he were thinking that he\nquite understood this puzzle.  She disconcerted him with what\nvain men call a cruel snub.  \"But whatever the reason, it\ncertainly couldn't have been you,\" said she.\n\n\"Now, look here, Lorna,\" protested Gideon, the beginnings of\nanger in his tone.  \"That's not the way to talk if you want to\nget on.\"\n\nShe eyed him with an expression which would have raised a\nsuspicion that he was repulsive in a man less self-confident,\nless indifferent to what the human beings he used for pleasure\nor profit thought of him.\n\n\"To say nothing of what I can do for you, there's the matter of\nfuture orders.  I order twice a year--in big lots always.\"\n\n\"I've quit down there.\"\n\n\"Oh!  Somebody else has given you something good--eh?  _That's_\nwhy you're cocky.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then why've you quit?\"\n\n\"I wish you could tell me.  I don't understand.  But--I've done it.\"\n\nGideon puzzled with this a moment, decided that it was beyond\nhim and unimportant, anyhow.  He blew out a cloud of smoke,\nstretched his legs and took up the main subject.  \"I was about\nto say, I've got a place for you.  I'd like to take you to\nChicago, but there's a Mrs. G.--as dear, sweet, good a soul as\never lived--just what a man wants at home with the children and\nto make things respectable.  I wouldn't grieve her for worlds.\nBut I can't live without a little fun--and Mrs. G. is a bit\nslow for me.  .  .  .  Still, it's no use talking about having\nyou out there.  She ought to be able to understand that an\nactive man needs two women.  One for the quiet side of his\nnature, the other for the lively side.  Sometimes I think\nshe--like a lot of wives--wouldn't object if it wasn't that she\nwas afraid the other lady would get me away altogether and\nshe'd be left stranded.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Not at all!\" cried he.  \"Don't you get any such notion in that\nlovely little head of yours, my dear.  You women don't\nunderstand honor--a man's sense of honor.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" repeated Susan.\n\nHe gave a glance of short disapproval.  Her voice was not to\nhis liking.  \"Let's drop Mrs. G. out of this,\" said he.  \"As\nI was saying, I've arranged for you to take a place here--easy\nwork--something to occupy you--and I'll foot the bills over and\nabove----\"\n\nHe stopped short or, rather, was stopped by the peculiar smile\nSusan had turned upon him.  Before it he slowly reddened, and\nhis eyes reluctantly shifted.  He had roused her from\nlistlessness, from indifference.  The poisons in her blood were\nburned up by the fresh, swiftly flowing currents set in motion\nby his words, by the helpfulness of his expression, of his\npresence.  She became again the intensely healthy, therefore\nintensely alive, therefore energetic and undaunted Susan Lenox,\nwho, when still a child, had not hesitated to fly from home,\nfrom everyone she knew, into an unknown world.\n\n\"What are you smiling at me that way for?\" demanded he in a\ntone of extreme irritation.\n\n\"So you look on me as your mistress?\"  And never in all her\nlife had her eyes been so gray--the gray of cruelest irony.\n\n\"Now what's the use discussing those things?  You know the\nworld.  You're a sensible woman.\"\n\nSusan made closer and more secure the large loose coil of her\nhair, rose and leaned against the table.  \"You don't\nunderstand.  You couldn't.  I'm not one of those respectable\nwomen, like your Mrs. G., who belong to men.  And I'm not one\nof the other kind who also throw in their souls with their\nbodies for good measure.  Do _you_ think you had _me?_\" She\nlaughed with maddening gentle mockery, went on:  \"I don't hate\nyou.  I don't despise you even.  You mean well.  But the sight\nof you makes me sick.  It makes me feel as I do when I think of\na dirty tenement I used to have to live in, and of the things\nthat I used to have to let crawl over me.  So I want to forget\nyou as soon as I can--and that will be soon after you get out\nof my sight.\"\n\nHer blazing eyes startled him.  Her voice, not lifted above its\nusual quiet tones, enraged him.  \"You--you!\" he cried.  \"You\nmust be crazy, to talk to _me_ like that!\"\n\nShe nodded.  \"Yes--crazy,\" said she with the same quiet intensity.\n\"For I know what kind of a beast you are--a clean, good-natured\nbeast, but still a beast.  And how could you understand?\"\n\nHe had got upon his feet.  He looked as if he were going to\nstrike her.\n\nShe made a slight gesture toward the door.  He felt at a\nhopeless disadvantage with her--with this woman who did not\nraise her voice, did not need to raise it to express the\nuttermost of any passion.  His jagged teeth gleamed through his\nmustache; his shrewd little eyes snapped like an angry rat's.\nHe fumbled about through the steam of his insane rage for\nadequate insults--in vain.  He rushed from the room and bolted\ndownstairs.\n\nWithin an hour Susan was out, looking for work.  There could be\nno turning back now.  Until she went with Gideon it had been as\nif her dead were still unburied and in the house.  Now----\n\nNever again could she even indulge in dreams of going to Rod.\nThat part of her life was finished with all the finality of the\nclosed grave.  Grief--yes.  But the same sort of grief as when\na loved one, after a long and painful illness, finds relief in\ndeath.  Her love for Rod had been stricken of a mortal illness\nthe night of their arrival in New York.  After lingering for a\nyear between life and death, after a long death agony, it had\nexpired.  The end came--these matters of the exact moment of\ninevitable events are unimportant but have a certain melancholy\ninterest--the end came when she made choice where there was no\nchoice, in the cab with Gideon.\n\nFor better or for worse she was free.  She was ready to begin\nher career.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nAFTER a few days, when she was viewing her situation in a\ncalmer, more normal mood with the practical feminine eye, she\nregretted that she had refused Gideon's money.  She was proud\nof that within herself which had impelled and compelled her to\nrefuse it; but she wished she had it.  Taking it, she felt,\nwould have added nothing to her humiliation in her own sight;\nand for what he thought of her, one way or the other, she cared\nnot a pin.  It is one of the familiar curiosities of human\ninconsistency which is at bottom so completely consistent, that\nshe did not regret having refused his far more valuable offer\nto aid her.\n\nShe did not regret even during those few next days of\ndisheartening search for work.  We often read how purpose can\nbe so powerful that it compels.  No doubt if Susan's purpose\nhad been to get temporary relief--or, perhaps, had it been to\nget permanent relief by weaving a sex spell--she would in that\ndesperate mood have been able to compel.  Unfortunately she was\nnot seeking to be a pauper or a parasite; she was trying to\nfind steady employment at living wages--that is, at wages above\nthe market value for female and for most male--labor.  And that\nsort of purpose cannot compel.\n\nOur civilization overflows with charity--which is simply\nwillingness to hand back to labor as generous gracious alms a\nsmall part of the loot from the just wages of labor.  But of\nreal help--just wages for honest labor--there is little, for real\nhelp would disarrange the system, would abolish the upper classes.\n\nShe had some faint hopes in the direction of millinery and\ndressmaking, the things for which she felt she had distinct\ntalent.  She was soon disabused.  There was nothing for her,\nand could be nothing until after several years of doubtful\napprenticeship in the trades to which any female person seeking\nemployment to piece out an income instinctively turned first\nand offered herself at the employer's own price.  Day after\nday, from the first moment of the industrial day until its end,\nshe hunted--wearily, yet unweariedly--with resolve living on\nafter the death of hope.  She answered advertisements; despite\nthe obviously sensible warnings of the working girls she talked\nwith she even consulted and took lists from the religious and\ncharitable organizations, patronized by those whose enthusiasm\nabout honest work had never been cooled by doing or trying to\ndo any of it, and managed by those who, beginning as workers,\nhad made all haste to escape from it into positions where they\ncould live by talking about it and lying about it--saying the\nthings comfortable people subscribe to philanthropies to hear.\n\nThere was work, plenty of it.  But not at decent wages, and not\nleading to wages that could be earned without viciously\nwronging those under her in an executive position.  But even in\nthose cases the prospect of promotion was vague and remote,\nwith illness and failing strength and poor food, worse clothing\nand lodgings, as certainties straightway.  At some places she\nwas refused with the first glance at her.  No good-looking\ngirls wanted; even though they behaved themselves and attracted\ncustomers, the customers lost sight of matters of merchandise\nin the all-absorbing matter of sex.  In offices a good-looking\ngirl upset discipline, caused the place to degenerate into a\ndeer-haunt in the mating season.  No place did she find\noffering more than four dollars a week, except where the dress\nrequirements made the nominally higher wages even less.\nEverywhere women's wages were based upon the assumption that\nwomen either lived at home or made the principal part of their\nincomes by prostitution, disguised or frank.  In fact, all\nwages even the wages of men except in a few trades--were too\nsmall for an independent support.  There had to be a family--and\nthe whole family had to work--and even then the joint income\nwas not enough for decency.  She had no family or friends to\nhelp her--at least, no friends except those as poor as herself,\nand she could not commit the crime of adding to their miseries.\n\nShe had less than ten dollars left.  She must get to work at\nonce--and what she earned must supply her with all.  A note\ncame from Jeffries--a curt request that she call--curt to\ndisguise the eagerness to have her back.  She tore it up.  She\ndid not even debate the matter.  It was one of her significant\nqualities that she never had the inclination, apparently lacked\nthe power, to turn back once she had turned away.  Mary Hinkle\ncame, urged her.  Susan listened in silence, merely shook her\nhead for answer, changed the subject.\n\nIn the entrance to the lofts of a tall Broadway building she\nsaw a placard:  \"Experienced hands at fancy ready-to-wear hat\ntrimming wanted.\"  She climbed three steep flights and was in\na large, low-ceilinged room where perhaps seventy-five girls\nwere at work.  She paused in the doorway long enough to observe\nthe kind of work--a purely mechanical process of stitching a\nfew trimmings in exactly the same way upon a cheap hat frame.\nThen she went to an open window in a glass partition and asked\nemployment of a young Jew with an incredibly long nose\nthrusting from the midst of a pimply face which seemed merely\nits too small base.\n\n\"Experienced?\" asked the young man.\n\n\"I can do what those girls are doing.\"\n\nWith intelligent eyes he glanced at her face, then let his\nglance rove contemptuously over the room full of workers.  \"I\nshould hope so,\" said he.  \"Forty cents a dozen.  Want to try it?\"\n\n\"When may I go to work?\"\n\n\"Right away.  Write your name here.\"\n\nSusan signed her name to what she saw at a glance was some sort\nof contract.  She knew it contained nothing to her advantage,\nmuch to her disadvantage.  But she did not care.  She had to\nhave work--something, anything that would stop the waste of her\nslender capital.  And within fifteen minutes she was seated in\nthe midst of the sweating, almost nauseatingly odorous women of\nall ages, was toiling away at the simple task of making an ugly\nhat frame still more ugly by the addition of a bit of tawdry\ncotton ribbon, a buckle, and a bunch of absurdly artificial\nflowers.  She was soon able to calculate roughly what she could\nmake in six days.  She thought she could do two dozen of the\nhats a day; and twelve dozen hats at forty cents the dozen\nwould mean four dollars and eighty cents a week!\n\nFour dollars and eighty cents!  Less than she had planned to\nset aside for food alone, out of her ten dollars as a model.\n\nNext her on the right sat a middle-aged woman, grossly fat,\nrepulsively shapeless, piteously homely--one of those luckless\nhuman beings who are foredoomed from the outset never to know\nany of the great joys of life the joys that come through our\npower to attract our fellow-beings.  As this woman stitched\naway, squinting through the steel-framed spectacles set upon\nher snub nose, Susan saw that she had not even good health to\nmitigate her lot, for her color was pasty and on her dirty skin\nlay blotches of dull red.  Except a very young girl here and\nthere all the women had poor or bad skins.  And Susan was not\nmade disdainful by the odor which is far worse than that of any\nlower animal, however dirty, because the human animal must wear\nclothing.  She had lived in wretchedness in a tenement; she\nknew that this odor was an inevitable part of tenement life\nwhen one has neither the time nor the means to be clean.  Poor\nfood, foul air, broken sleep--bad health, disease, unsightly\nfaces, repulsive bodies!\n\nNo wonder the common people looked almost like another race in\ncontrast with their brothers and sisters of the comfortable\nclasses.  Another race!  The race into which she would soon be\nreborn under the black magic of poverty!  As she glanced and\nreflected on what she saw, viewed it in the light of her\nexperience, her fingers slackened, and she could speed them up\nonly in spurts.\n\n\"If I stay here,\" thought she, \"in a few weeks I shall be like\nthese others.  No matter how hard I may fight, I'll be dragged\ndown.\"  As impossible to escape the common lot as for a swimmer\nalone in mid-ocean to keep up indefinitely whether long or\nbrief, the struggle could have but, the one end--to be sunk in,\nmerged in, the ocean.\n\nIt took no great amount of vanity for her to realize that she\nwas in every way the superior of all those around her--in every\nway except one.  What did she lack?  Why was it that with her\nsuperior intelligence, her superior skill both of mind and of\nbody, she could be thus dragged down and held far below her\nnatural level?  Why could she not lift herself up among the\nsort of people with whom she belonged--or even make a beginning\ntoward lifting herself up?  Why could she not take hold?  What\ndid she lack?  What must she acquire--or what get rid of?\n\nAt lunch time she walked with the ugly woman up and down the\nfirst side street above the building in which the factory was\nlocated.  She ate a roll she bought from a pushcart man, the\nwoman munched an apple with her few remnants of teeth.  \"Most\nof the girls is always kicking,\" said the woman.  \"But I'm\nmighty satisfied.  I get enough to eat and to wear, and I've\ngot a bed to sleep in--and what else is there in life for\nanybody, rich or poor?\"\n\n\"There's something to be said for that,\" replied Susan,\nmarveling to find in this piteous creature the only case of\nthorough content she had ever seen.\n\n\"I make my four to five per,\" continued the woman.  \"And I've\ngot only myself.  Thank God, I was never fool enough to marry.\nIt's marrying that drags us poor people down and makes us\nmiserable.  Some says to me, 'Ain't you lonesome?' And I says\nto them, says I, 'Why, I'm used to being alone.  I don't want\nanything else.' If they was all like me, they'd not be fightin'\nand drinkin' and makin' bad worse.  The bosses always likes to\ngive me work.  They say I'm a model worker, and I'm proud to\nsay they're right.  I'm mighty grateful to the bosses that\nprovide for the like of us.  What'd we do without 'em?  That's\nwhat _I_'d like to know.\"\n\nShe had pitied this woman because she could never hope to\nexperience any of the great joys of life.  What a waste of pity,\nshe now thought.  She had overlooked the joy of joys--delusions.\nThis woman was secure for life against unhappiness.\n\nA few days, and Susan was herself regarded as a model worker.\nShe turned out hats so rapidly that the forewoman, urged on by\nMr. Himberg, the proprietor, began to nag at the other girls.\nAnd presently a notice of general reduction to thirty-five\ncents a dozen was posted.  There had been a union; it had won\na strike two years before--and then had been broken up by\nshrewd employing of detectives who had got themselves elected\nofficers.  With the union out of the way, there was no check\nupon the bosses in their natural and lawful effort to get that\nprofit which is the most high god of our civilization.  A few\nof the youngest and most spirited girls--those from families\ncontaining several workers--indignantly quit.  A few others\nmurmured, but stayed on.  The mass dumbly accepted the extra\ntwist in the screw of the mighty press that was slowly\nsqueezing them to death.  Neither to them nor to Susan herself\ndid it happen to occur that she was the cause of the general\nincrease of hardship and misery.  However, to have blamed her\nwould have been as foolish and as unjust as to blame any other\nindividual.  The system ordained it all.  Oppression and\noppressed were both equally its helpless instruments.  No\nwonder all the vast beneficent discoveries of science that\nought to have made the whole human race healthy, long-lived and\nprosperous, are barely able to save the race from swift decay\nand destruction under the ravages of this modern system of\nlabor worse than slavery--for under slavery the slave, being\nproperty whose loss could not be made good without expense, was\nprotected in life and in health.\n\nSusan soon discovered that she had miscalculated her earning\npower.  She had been deceived by her swiftness in the first\ndays, before the monotony of her task had begun to wear her\ndown.  Her first week's earnings were only four dollars and\nthirty cents.  This in her freshness, and in the busiest season\nwhen wages were at the highest point.\n\nIn the room next hers--the same, perhaps a little\ndingier--lived a man.  Like herself he had no trade--that is,\nnone protected by a powerful union and by the still more\npowerful--in fact, the only powerful shield--requirements of\nhealth and strength and a certain grade of intelligence that\ntogether act rigidly to exclude most men and so to keep wages\nfrom dropping to the neighborhood of the line of pauperism.  He\nwas the most industrious and, in his small way, the most\nresourceful of men.  He was insurance agent, toilet soap agent,\npiano tuner, giver of piano lessons, seller of pianos and of\nmusic on commission.  He worked fourteen and sixteen hours a\nday.  He made nominally about twelve to fifteen a week.\nActually--because of the poverty of his customers and his too\nsympathetic nature he made five to six a week--the most any\nworking person could hope for unless in one of the few favored\ntrades.  Barely enough to keep body and soul together.  And why\nshould capital that needs so much for fine houses and wines and\nservants and automobiles and culture and charity and the other\nluxuries--why should capital pay more when so many were\ncompeting for the privilege of being allowed to work?\n\nShe gave up her room at Mrs. Tucker's--after she had spent\nseveral evenings walking the streets and observing and thinking\nabout the miseries of the fast women of the only class she\ncould hope to enter.  \"A woman,\" she decided, \"can't even earn\na decent living that way unless she has the money to make the\nright sort of a start.  'To him that hath shall be given; from\nhim that hath not shall be taken away even that which he\nhath.' Gideon was my chance and I threw it away.\"\n\nStill, she did not regret.  Of all the horrors the most\nrepellent seemed to her to be dependence upon some one man who\ncould take it away at his whim.\n\nShe disregarded the advice of the other girls and made the\nrounds of the religious and charitable homes for working girls.\nShe believed she could endure perhaps better than could girls\nwith more false pride, with more awe of snobbish\nconventionalities--at least she could try to endure--the\nsuperciliousness, the patronizing airs, the petty restraints\nand oppressions, the nauseating smugness, the constant prying\nand peeping, the hypocritical lectures, the heavy doses of smug\nmorality.  She felt that she could bear with almost any\nannoyances and humiliations to be in clean surroundings and to\nget food that was at least not so rotten that the eye could see\nit and the nose smell it.  But she found all the homes full,\nwith long waiting lists, filled for the most part, so the\nworking girls said, with professional objects of charity.  Thus\nshe had no opportunity to judge for herself whether there was\nany truth in the prejudice of the girls against these few and\nfeeble attempts to mitigate the miseries of a vast and ever\nvaster multitude of girls.  Adding together all the\naccommodations offered by all the homes of every description,\nthere was a total that might possibly have provided for the\nhomeless girls of a dozen factories or sweatshops--and the\nnumber of homeless girls was more than a quarter of a million,\nwas increasing at the rate of more than a hundred a day.\n\nCharity is so trifling a force that it can, and should be,\ndisregarded.  It serves no _good_ useful service.  It enables\ncomfortable people to delude themselves that all that can be\ndone is being done to mitigate the misfortunes which the poor\nbring upon themselves.  It obscures the truth that modern\ncivilization has been perverted into a huge manufacturing of\ndecrepitude and disease, of poverty and prostitution.  The\nreason we talk so much and listen so eagerly when our\nmagnificent benevolences are the subject is that we do not wish\nto be disturbed--and that we dearly love the tickling sensation\nin our vanity of generosity.\n\nSusan was compelled to the common lot--the lot that will be the\ncommon lot as long as there are people to be made, by taking\nadvantage of human necessities, to force men and women and\nchildren to degrade themselves into machines as wage-slaves.\nAt two dollars a week, double what her income justified--she\nrented a room in a tenement flat in Bleecker street.  It was a\ncloset of a room whose thin, dirt-adorned walls were no\nprotection against sound or vermin, not giving even privacy\nfrom prying eyes.  She might have done a little better had she\nbeen willing to share room and bed with one or more girls, but\nnot enough better to compensate for what that would have meant.\n\nThe young Jew with the nose so impossible that it elevated his\ncountenance from commonplace ugliness to weird distinction had\ntaken a friendly fancy to her.  He was Julius Bam, nephew of\nthe proprietor.  In her third week he offered her the\nforewoman's place.  \"You've got a few brains in your head,\"\nsaid he.  \"Miss Tuohy's a boob.  Take the job and you'll push\nup.  We'll start you at five per.\"\n\nSusan thanked him but declined.  \"What's the use of my taking\na job I couldn't keep more than a day or two?\" explained she.\n\"I haven't it in me to boss people.\"\n\n\"Then you've got to get it, or you're done for,\" said he.\n\"Nobody ever gets anywhere until he's making others work for him.\"\n\nIt was the advice she had got from Matson, the paper box\nmanufacturer in Cincinnati.  It was the lesson she found in all\nprosperity on every hand.  Make others work for you--and the\nharder you made them work the more prosperous you\nwere--provided, of course, you kept all or nearly all the\nprofits of their harder toil.  Obvious common sense.  But how\ncould she goad these unfortunates, force their clumsy fingers\nto move faster, make their long and weary day longer and\nwearier--with nothing for them as the result but duller brain,\nclumsier fingers, more wretched bodies?  She realized why those\nabove lost all patience with them, treated them with contempt.\nOnly as one of them could any intelligent, energetic human\nbeing have any sympathy for them, stupid and incompetent from\nbirth, made ever more and more stupid and incapable by the\ndegrading lives they led.  She could scarcely conceal her\nrepulsion for their dirty bodies, their stained and rotting\nclothing saturated with stale sweat, their coarse flesh reeking\ncoarse food smells.  She could not listen to their\nconversation, so vulgar, so inane.  Yet she felt herself--for\nthe time--one of them, and her heart bled for them.  And while\nshe knew that only their dullness of wit and ignorance kept\nthem from climbing up and stamping and trampling full as\nsavagely and cruelly as did those on top, still the fact\nremained that they were not stamping and trampling.\n\nAs she was turning in some work, Miss Tuohy said abruptly:\n\"You don't belong here.  You ought to go back.\"\n\nSusan started, and her heart beat wildly.  She was going to\nlose her job!\n\nThe forelady saw, and instantly understood.  \"I don't mean\nthat,\" she said.  \"You can stay as long as you like--as long as\nyour health lasts.  But isn't there somebody\nsomewhere--_anybody_--you can go to and ask them to help you out\nof this?\"\n\n\"No--there's no one,\" said she.\n\n\"That can't be true,\" insisted the forelady.  \"Everybody has\nsomebody--or can get somebody--that is, anyone who looks like\nyou.  I wouldn't suggest such a thing to a fool.  But _you_\ncould keep your head.  There isn't any other way, and you might\nas well make up your mind to it.\"\n\nTo confide is one of the all but universal longings--perhaps\nneeds--of human nature.  Susan's honest, sympathetic eyes, her\nlook and her habit of reticence, were always attracting\nconfidences from such unexpected sources as hard, forbidding\nMiss Tuohy.  Susan was not much surprised when Miss Tuohy went\non to say:\n\n\"I was spoiled when I was still a kid--by getting to know well\na man who was above my class.  I had tastes that way, and he\nappealed to them.  After him I couldn't marry the sort of man\nthat wanted me.  Then my looks went--like a flash--it often\nhappens that way with us Irish girls.  But I can get on.  I\nknow how to deal with these people--and _you_ never could learn.\nYou'd treat 'em like ladies and they'd treat you as easy fruit.\nYes, I get along all right, and I'm happy--away from here.\"\n\nSusan's sympathetic glance of inquiry gave the necessary\nencouragement.  \"It's a baby,\" Miss Tuohy explained--and Susan\nknew it was for the baby's sake that this good heart had\nhardened itself to the dirty work of forelady.  Her eyes\nshifted as she said, \"A child of my sister's--dead in Ireland.\nHow I do love that baby----\"\n\nThey were interrupted and it so happened that the confidence\nwas never resumed and finished.  But Miss Tuohy had made her\npoint with Susan--had set her to thinking less indefinitely.\n\"I _must_ take hold!\" Susan kept saying to herself.  The\nphrase was always echoing in her brain.  But how?--_how?_  And\nto that question she could find no answer.\n\nEvery morning she bought a one-cent paper whose big circulation\nwas in large part due to its want ads--its daily section of\nclosely printed columns of advertisements of help wanted and\nsituations wanted.  Susan read the columns diligently.  At\nfirst they acted upon her like an intoxicant, filling her not\nmerely with hope but with confident belief that soon she would\nbe in a situation where the pay was good and the work\nagreeable, or at least not disagreeable.  But after a few weeks\nshe ceased from reading.\n\nWhy?  Because she answered the advertisements, scores of them,\nmore than a hundred, before she saw through the trick and gave\nup.  She found that throughout New York all the attractive or\neven tolerable places were filled by girls helped by their\nfamilies or in other ways, girls working at less than living\nwages because they did not have to rely upon their wages for\ntheir support.  And those help wanted advertisements were\nsimply appeals for more girls of that sort--for cheaper girls;\nor they were inserted by employment agencies, masquerading in\nthe newspaper as employers and lying in wait to swindle working\ngirls by getting a fee in exchange for a false promise of good\nwork at high wages; or they were the nets flung out by crafty\nemployers who speeded and starved their slaves, and wished to\nrecruit fresh relays to replace those that had quit in\nexhaustion or in despair.\n\n\"Why do you always read the want ads?\" she said to Lany\nRicardo, who spent all her spare time at those advertisements\nin two papers she bought and one she borrowed every day.  \"Did\nyou ever get anything good, or hear of anybody that did?\"\n\n\"Oh, my, no,\" replied Lany with a laugh.  \"I read for the same\nreason that all the rest do.  It's a kind of dope.  You read\nand then you dream about the places--how grand they are and how\nwell off you'll be.  But nobody'd be fool enough to answer one\nof 'em unless she was out of a job and had to get another and\ndidn't care how rotten it was.  No, it's just dope--like buyin'\npolicy numbers or lottery tickets.  You know you won't git a\nprize, but you have a lot of fun dreaming about it.\"\n\nAs Susan walked up and down at the lunch hour, she talked with\nworkers, both men and women, in all sorts of employment.  Some\nwere doing a little better than she; others--the most--were\nworse off chiefly because her education, her developed\nintelligence, enabled her to ward off savage blows--such as\nillness from rotten food--against which their ignorance made\nthem defenseless.  Whenever she heard a story of someone's\ngetting on, how grotesquely different it was from the stories\nshe used to get out of the Sunday school library and dream\nover!  These almost actualities of getting on had nothing in\nthem about honesty and virtue.  According to them it was always\nsome sort of meanness or trickery; and the particular meanness\nor tricks were, in these practical schools of success in\nsession at each lunch hour, related in detail as lessons in how\nto get on.  If the success under discussion was a woman's, it\nwas always how her boss or employer had \"got stuck on her\" and\nhad given her an easier job with good pay so that she could\nwear clothes more agreeable to his eyes and to his touch.  Now\nand then it was a wonderful dazzling success--some girl had got\nher rich employer so \"dead crazy\" about her that he had taken\nher away from work altogether and had set her up in a flat with\na servant and a \"swell trap\"; there was even talk of marriage.\n\nWas it true?  Were the Sunday school books through and through\nlies--ridiculous, misleading lies, wicked lies--wicked because\nthey hid the shameful truth that ought to be proclaimed from\nthe housetops?  Susan was not sure.  Perhaps envy twisted\nsomewhat these tales of rare occasional successes told by the\nworkers to each other.  But certain it was that, wherever she\nhad the opportunity to see for herself, success came only by\nhardness of heart, by tricks and cheats.  Certain it was also\nthat the general belief among the workers was that success\ncould be got in those ways only--and this belief made the\nfalsehood, if it was a falsehood, or the partial truth, if it\nwas a twisted truth, full as poisonous as if it had been true\nthroughout.  Also, if the thing were not true, how came it that\neveryone in practical life believed it to be so--how came it\nthat everyone who talked in praise of honesty and virtue\nlooked, as he talked, as if he were canting and half expected\nto be laughed at?\n\nAll about her as badly off as she, or worse off.  Yet none so\nunhappy as she--not even the worse off.  In fact, the worse off\nas the better off were not so deeply wretched.  Because they\nhad never in all their lives known the decencies of life clean\nlodgings, clean clothing, food fit to eat, leisure and the\nmeans of enjoying leisure.  And Susan had known all these\nthings.  When she realized why her companions in misery, so\nfeeble in self-restraint, were able to endure patiently and for\nthe most part even cheerfully, how careful she was never to say\nor to suggest anything that might put ideas of what life might\nbe, of what it was for the comfortable few, into the minds of\nthese girls who never had known and could only be made wretched\nby knowing!  How fortunate for them, she thought, that they had\ngone to schools where they met only their own kind!  How\nfortunate that the devouring monster of industry had snatched\nthem away from school before their minds had been awakened to\nthe realities of life!  How fortunate that their imaginations\nwere too dull and too heavy to be touched by the sights of\nluxury they saw in the streets or by what they read in the\nnewspapers and in the cheap novels!  To them, as she soon\nrealized, their world seemed the only world, and the world that\nlived in comfort seemed a vague unreality, as must seem\nwhatever does not come into our own experience.\n\nOne lunch hour an apostle of discontent preaching some kind of\npolitics or other held forth on the corner above the shop.\nSusan paused to listen.  She had heard only a few words when\nshe was incensed to the depths of her heart against him.  He\nought to be stopped by the police, this scoundrel trying to\nmake these people unhappy by awakening them to the misery and\ndegradation of their lot!  He looked like an honest, earnest\nman.  No doubt he fancied that he was in some way doing good.\nThese people who were always trying to do the poor good--they\nought all to be suppressed!  If someone could tell them how to\ncease to be poor, that would indeed be good.  But such a thing\nwould be impossible.  In Sutherland, where the best off hadn't\nso painfully much more than the worst off, and where everybody\nbut the idle and the drunken, and even they most of the time,\nhad enough to eat, and a decent place to sleep, and some kind\nof Sunday clothes--in Sutherland the poverty was less than in\nCincinnati, infinitely less than in this vast and incredibly\nrich New York where in certain districts wealth, enormous\nwealth, was piled up and up.  So evidently the presence of\nriches did not help poverty but seemed to increase it.  No, the\ndisease was miserable, thought Susan.  For most of the human\nrace, disease and bad food and vile beds in dingy holes and\ndays of fierce, poorly paid toil--that was the law of this hell\nof a world.  And to escape from that hideous tyranny, you must\nbe hard, you must trample, you must rob, you must cease to be human.\n\nThe apostle of discontent insisted that the law could be\nchanged, that the tyranny could be abolished.  She listened,\nbut he did not convince her.  He sounded vague and dreamy--as\nfantastically false in his new way as she had found the Sunday\nschool books to be.  She passed on.\n\nShe continued to pay out a cent each day for the newspaper.\nShe no longer bothered with the want ads.  Pipe dreaming did\nnot attract her; she was too fiercely bent upon escape, actual\nescape, to waste time in dreaming of ways of escape that she\nnever could realize.  She read the paper because, if she could\nnot live in the world but was battered down in its dark and\nfoul and crowded cellar, she at least wished to know what was\ngoing on up in the light and air.  She found every day news of\ngreat doings, of wonderful rises, of rich rewards for industry\nand thrift, of abounding prosperity and of opportunity fairly\nforcing itself into acceptance.  But all this applied only to\nthe few so strangely and so luckily chosen, while the mass was\nrejected.  For that mass, from earliest childhood until death,\nthere was only toil in squalor--squalid food, squalid clothing,\nsqualid shelter.  And when she read one day--in an obscure\nparagraph in her newspaper--that the income of the average\nAmerican family was less than twelve dollars a week--less than\ntwo dollars and a half a week for each individual--she realized\nthat what she was seeing and living was not New York and\nCincinnati, but was the common lot, country wide, no doubt\nworld wide.\n\n\"_Must_ take hold!\" her mind cried incessantly to her shrinking\nheart.  \"Somehow--anyhow--take hold!--must--must--_must!_\"\n\nThose tenement houses!  Those tenement streets!  Everywhere\nwandering through the crowds the lonely old women--holding up\nto the girls the mirror of time and saying:  \"Look at my\nmisery!  Look at my disease-blasted body.  Look at my toil-bent\nform and toil-wrecked hands.  Look at my masses of wrinkles, at\nmy rags, at my leaky and rotten shoes.  Think of my\naloneness--not a friend--feared and cast off by my relatives\nbecause they are afraid they will have to give me food and\nlodgings.  Look at me--think of my life--and know that I am\n_you_ as you will be a few years from now whether you work as a\nslave to the machine or as a slave to the passions of one or of\nmany men.  I am _you_.  Not one in a hundred thousand escape my\nfate except by death.\"\n\n\"Somehow--anyhow--I must take hold,\" cried Susan to her\nswooning heart.\n\nWhen her capital had dwindled to three dollars Mrs. Tucker\nappeared.  Her face was so beaming bright that Susan, despite\nher being clad in garments on which a pawnshop would advance\nnothing, fancied she had come with good news.\n\n\"Now that I'm rid of that there house,\" said she, \"I'll begin\nto perk up.  I ain't got nothing left to worry me.  I'm ready\nfor whatever blessings the dear Master'll provide.  My pastor\ntells me I'm the finest example of Christian fortitude he ever\nSaw.  But\"--and Mrs. Tucker spoke with genuine modesty--\"I tell\nhim I don't deserve no credit for leaning on the Lord.  If I\ncan trust Him in death, why not in life?\"\n\n\"You've got a place?  The church has----\"\n\n\"Bless you, no,\" cried Mrs. Tucker.  \"Would I burden 'em with\nmyself, when there's so many that has to be looked after?  No,\nI go direct to the Lord.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?  What place have you got?\"\n\n\"None as yet.  But He'll provide something--something better'n\nI deserve.\"\n\nSusan had to turn away, to hide her pity--and her\ndisappointment.  Not only was she not to be helped, but also\nshe must help another.  \"You might get a job at the hat\nfactory,\" said she.\n\nMrs. Tucker was delighted.  \"I knew it!\" she cried.  \"Don't you\nsee how He looks after me?\"\n\nSusan persuaded Miss Tuohy to take Mrs. Tucker on.  She could\ntruthfully recommend the old woman as a hard worker.  They\nmoved into a room in a tenement in South Fifth Avenue.  Susan\nread in the paper about a model tenement and went to try for\nwhat was described as real luxury in comfort and cleanliness.\nShe found that sort of tenements filled with middle-class\nfamilies on their way down in the world and making their last\nstand against rising rents and rising prices.  The model\ntenement rents were far, far beyond her ability to pay.  She\nmight as well think of moving to the Waldorf.  She and Mrs.\nTucker had to be content with a dark room on the fifth floor,\nopening on a damp air shaft whose odor was so foul that in\ncomparison the Clinton Place shaft was as the pure breath of\nthe open sky.  For this shelter--more than one-half the free\nand proud citizens of prosperous America dwelling in cities\noccupy its like, or worse they paid three dollars a week--a\ndollar and a half apiece.  They washed their underclothing at\nnight, slept while it was drying.  And Susan, who could not\nbring herself to imitate the other girls and wear a blouse of\ndark color that was not to be washed, rose at four to do the\nnecessary ironing.  They did their own cooking.  It was no\nlonger possible for Susan to buy quality and content herself\nwith small quantity.  However small the quantity of food she\ncould get along on, it must be of poor quality--for good\nquality was beyond her means.\n\nIt maddened her to see the better class of working girls.\nTheir fairly good clothing, their evidences of some comfort at\nhome, seemed to mock at her as a poor fool who was being beaten\ndown because she had not wit enough to get on.  She knew these\ngirls were either supporting themselves in part by prostitution\nor were held up by their families, by the pooling of the\nearnings of several persons.  Left to themselves, to their own\nearnings at work, they would be no better off than she, or at\nbest so little better off that the difference was unimportant.\nIf to live decently in New York took an income of fifteen\ndollars a week, what did it matter whether one got five or ten\nor twelve?  Any wages below fifteen meant a steady downward\ndrag--meant exposure to the dirt and poison of poverty\ntenements--meant the steady decline of the power of resistance,\nthe steady oozing away of self-respect, of the courage and hope\nthat give the power to rise.  To have less than the fifteen\ndollars absolutely necessary for decent surroundings, decent\nclothing, decent food--that meant one was drowning.  What\nmatter whether the death of the soul was quick, or slow,\nwhether the waters of destruction were twenty feet deep or\ntwenty thousand?\n\nMrs. Reardon, the servant woman on the top floor, was evicted\nand Susan and Mrs. Tucker took her in.  She protested that she\ncould sleep on the floor, that she had done so a large part of\nher life--that she preferred it to most beds.  But Susan made\nher up a kind of bed in the corner.  They would not let her pay\nanything.  She had rheumatism horribly, some kind of lung\ntrouble, and the almost universal and repulsive catarrh that\npreys upon working people.  Her hair had dwindled to a meager\nwisp.  This she wound into a hard little knot and fastened with\nan imitation tortoise-shell comb, huge, high, and broken, set\nwith large pieces of glass cut like diamonds.  Her teeth were\nall gone and her cheeks almost met in her mouth.\n\nOne day, when Mrs. Tucker and Mrs. Reardon were exchanging\neulogies upon the goodness of God to them, Susan shocked them\nby harshly ordering them to be silent.  \"If God hears you,\" she\nsaid, \"He'll think you're mocking Him.  Anyhow, I can't stand\nany more of it.  Hereafter do your talking of that kind when\nI'm not here.\"\n\nAnother day Mrs. Reardon told about her sister.  The sister had\nworked in a factory where some sort of poison that had a\nrotting effect on the human body was used in the manufacture.\nLike a series of others the sister caught the disease.  But\ninstead of rotting out a spot, a few fingers, or part of the\nface, it had eaten away the whole of her lower jaw so that she\nhad to prepare her food for swallowing by first pressing it\nwith her fingers against her upper teeth.  Used as Susan was to\nhearing horrors in this region where disease and accident\npreyed upon every family, she fled from the room and walked\nshuddering about the streets--the streets with their incessant\nmarch past of blighted and blasted, of maimed and crippled and\nworm-eaten.  Until that day Susan had been about as unobservant\nof the obvious things as is the rest of the race.  On that day\nshe for the first time noticed the crowd in the street, with\nmind alert to signs of the ravages of accident and disease.\nHardly a sound body, hardly one that was not piteously and\nhideously marked.\n\nWhen she returned--and she did not stay out long--Mrs. Tucker\nwas alone.  Said she:\n\n\"Mrs. Reardon says the rotten jaw was sent on her sister as a\npunishment for marrying a Protestant, she being a Catholic.\nHow ignorant some people is!  Of course, the good Lord sent the\njudgment on her for being a Catholic at all.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Tucker,\" said Susan, \"did you ever hear of Nero?\"\n\n\"He burned up Rome--and he burned up the Christian martyrs,\"\nsaid Mrs. Tucker.  \"I had a good schooling.  Besides, sermons\nis highly educating.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Susan, \"if I had a choice of living under Nero or\nof living under that God you and Mrs. Reardon talk about, I'd\ntake Nero and be thankful and happy.\"\n\nMrs. Tucker would have fled if she could have afforded it.  As\nit was all she ventured was a sigh and lips moving in prayer.\n\nOn a Friday in late October, at the lunch hour, Susan was\nwalking up and down the sunny side of Broadway.  It was the\nfirst distinctly cool day of the autumn; there had been a heavy\ndownpour of rain all morning, but the New York sun that is ever\nstruggling to shine and is successful on all but an occasional\nday was tearing up and scattering the clouds with the aid of a\nsharp north wind blowing down the deep canyon.  She was wearing\nher summer dress still--old and dingy but clean.  That look of\nneatness about the feet--that charm of a well-shaped foot and\na well-turned ankle properly set off--had disappeared--with her\nthe surest sign of the extreme of desperate poverty.  Her shoes\nwere much scuffed, were even slightly down at the heel; her\nsailor hat would have looked only the worse had it had a fresh\nribbon on its crown.  This first hint of winter had stung her\nfast numbing faculties into unusual activity.  She was\nremembering the misery of the cold in Cincinnati--the misery\nthat had driven her into prostitution as a drunken driver's\nlash makes the frenzied horse rush he cares not where in his\ndesire to escape.  This wind of Broadway--this first warning of\nwinter--it was hissing in her ears:  \"Take hold!  Winter is\ncoming!  Take hold!\"\n\nSummer and winter--fiery heat and brutal cold.  Like the devils\nin the poem, the poor--the masses, all but a few of the human\nrace--were hurried from fire to ice, to vary their torment and\nto make it always exquisite.\n\nTo shelter herself for a moment she paused at a spot that\nhappened to be protected to the south by a projecting sidewalk\nsign.  She was facing, with only a tantalizing sheet of glass\nbetween, a display of winter underclothes on wax figures.  To\nshow them off more effectively the sides and the back of the\nwindow were mirrors.  Susan's gaze traveled past the figures to\na person she saw standing at full length before her.  \"Who is\nthat pale, stooped girl?\" she thought.  \"How dreary and sad she\nlooks!  How hard she is fighting to make her clothes look\ndecent, when they aren't!  She must be something like me--only\nmuch worse off.\"  And then she realized that she was gazing at\nher own image, was pitying her own self.  The room she and Mrs.\nTucker and the old scrubwoman occupied was so dark, even with\nits one little gas jet lighted, that she was able to get only\na faint look at herself in the little cracked and water-marked\nmirror over its filthy washstand--filthy because the dirt was so\nground in that only floods of water and bars of soap could have\ncleaned down to its original surface.  She was having a clear\nlook at herself for the first time in three months.\n\nShe shrank in horror, yet gazed on fascinated.  Why, her\nphysical charm had gone gone, leaving hardly a trace!  Those\ndull, hollow eyes--that thin and almost ghastly face--the\nemaciated form--the once attractive hair now looking poor and\nstringy because it could not be washed properly--above all, the\nsad, bitter expression about the mouth.  Those pale lips!  Her\nlips had been from childhood one of her conspicuous and most\ntempting beauties; and as the sex side of her nature had\ndeveloped they had bloomed into wonderful freshness and\nvividness of form and color.  Now----\n\nThose pale, pale lips!  They seemed to form a sort of climax of\ntragedy to the melancholy of her face.  She gazed on and on.\nShe noted every detail.  How she had fallen!  Indeed, a fallen\nwoman!  These others had been born to the conditions that were\ndestroying her; they were no worse off, in many cases better\noff.  But she, born to comfort and custom of intelligent\neducated associations and associates----\n\nA fallen woman!\n\nHonest work!  Even if it were true that this honest work was a\nsort of probation through which one rose to better things--even\nif this were true, could it be denied that only a few at best\ncould rise, that the most--including all the sensitive, and\nmost of the children--must wallow on, must perish?  Oh, the\nlies, the lies about honest work!\n\nRosa Mohr, a girl of her own age who worked in the same room,\njoined her.  \"Admiring yourself?\" she said laughing.  \"Well, I\ndon't blame you.  You _are_ pretty.\"\n\nSusan at first thought Rosa was mocking her.  But the tone and\nexpression were sincere.\n\n\"It won't last long,\" Rosa went on.  \"I wasn't so bad myself\nwhen I quit the high school and took a job because father lost\nhis business and his health.  He got in the way of one of those\ntrusts.  So of course they handed it to him good and hard.  But\nhe wasn't a squealer.  He always said they'd done only what\nhe'd been doing himself if he'd had the chance.  I always think\nof what papa used to say when I hear people carrying on about\nhow wicked this or that somebody else is.\"\n\n\"Are you going to stay on--at this life?\" asked Susan, still\nlooking at her own image.\n\n\"I guess so.  What else is there?  .  .  .  I've got a steady.\nWe'll get married as soon as he has a raise to twelve per.  But\nI'll not be any better off.  My beau's too stupid ever to make\nmuch.  If you see me ten years from now I'll probably be a fat,\nsloppy old thing, warming a window sill or slouching about in\ndirty rags.\"\n\n\"Isn't there any way to--to escape?\"\n\n\"It does look as though there ought to be--doesn't it?  But\nI've thought and thought, and _I_ can't see it--and I'm pretty\nnear straight Jew.  They say things are better than they used\nto be, and I guess they are.  But not enough better to help me\nany.  Perhaps my children--_if_ I'm fool enough to have\nany--perhaps they'll get a chance.  .  .  .  But I wouldn't\ngamble on it.\"\n\nSusan was still looking at her rags--at her pale lips--was\navoiding meeting her own eyes.  \"Why not try the streets?\"\n\n\"Nothing in it,\" said Rosa, practically.  \"I did try it for a\nwhile and quit.  Lots of the girls do, and only the fools stay\nat it.  Once in a while there's a girl who's lucky and gets a\nlover that's kind to her or a husband that can make good.  But\nthat's luck.  For one that wins out, a thousand lose.\"\n\n\"Luck?\" said Susan.\n\nRosa laughed.  \"You're right.  It's something else besides\nluck.  The trouble is a girl loses her head--falls in\nlove--supports a man--takes to drink--don't look out for her\nhealth--wastes her money.  Still--where's the girl with head\nenough to get on where there's so many temptations?\"\n\n\"But there's no chance at all, keeping straight, you say.\"\n\n\"The other thing's worse.  The street girls--of our class, I\nmean--don't average as much as we do.  And it's an awful\nbusiness in winter.  And they spend so much time in station\nhouses and over on the Island.  And, gosh! how the men do\ntreat them!  You haven't any idea.  You wouldn't believe the\nhorrible things the girls have to do to earn their money--a\nquarter or half a dollar--and maybe the men don't pay them even\nthat.  A girl tries to get her money in advance, but often she\ndoesn't.  And as they have to dress better than we do, and live\nwhere they can clean up a little, they 'most starve.  Oh, that\nlife's hell.\"\n\nSusan had turned away from her image, was looking at Rosa.\n\n\"As for the fast houses----\" Rosa shuddered--\"I was in one for\na week.  I ran away--it was the only way I could escape.  I'd\nnever tell any human being what I went through in that house. . . .\nNever!\" She watched Susan's fine sympathetic face, and\nin a burst of confidence said:  \"One night the landlady sent me\nup with seventeen men.  And she kept the seventeen dollars I\nmade, and took away from me half a dollar one drunken\nlongshoreman gave me as a present.  She said I owed it for\nboard and clothes.  In those houses, high and low, the girls\nalways owes the madam.  They haven't a stitch of their own to\ntheir backs.\"\n\nThe two girls stood facing each other, each looking past the\nother into the wind-swept canyon of Broadway--the majestic\nvista of lofty buildings, symbols of wealth and luxury so\nabundant that it flaunted itself, overflowed in gaudy\nextravagance.  Finally Susan said:\n\n\"Do you ever think of killing yourself?\"\n\n\"I thought I would,\" replied the other girl.  \"But I guess I\nwouldn't have.  Everybody knows there's no hope, yet they keep\non hopin'.  And I've got pretty good health yet, and once in a\nwhile I have some fun.  You ought to go to dances--and drink.\nYou wouldn't be blue _all_ the time, then.\"\n\n\"If it wasn't for the sun,\" said Susan.\n\n\"The sun?\" inquired Rosa.\n\n\"Where I came from,\" explained Susan, \"it rained a great deal,\nand the sky was covered so much of the time.  But here in New\nYork there is so much sun.  I love the sun.  I get\ndesperate--then out comes the sun, and I say to myself, 'Well,\nI guess I can go on a while longer, with the sun to help me.'\"\n\n\"I hadn't thought of it,\" said Rosa, \"but the sun is a help.\"\n\nThat indefatigable New York sun!  It was like Susan's own\ncourage.  It fought the clouds whenever clouds dared to appear\nand contest its right to shine upon the City of the Sun, and\nhardly a day was so stormy that for a moment at least the sun\ndid not burst through for a look at its beloved.\n\nFor weeks Susan had eaten almost nothing.  During her previous\nsojourn in the slums--the slums of Cincinnati, though they were\nnot classed as slums--the food had seemed revolting.  But she\nwas less discriminating then.  The only food she could afford\nnow--the food that is the best obtainable for a majority of the\ninhabitants of any city--was simply impossible for her.  She\nate only when she could endure no longer.  This starvation no\ndoubt saved her from illness; but at the same time it drained\nher strength.  Her vitality had been going down, a little each\nday--lower and lower.  The poverty which had infuriated her at\nfirst was now acting upon her like a soothing poison.  The\nreason she had not risen to revolt was this slow and subtle\npoison that explains the inertia of the tenement poor from\nbabyhood.  To be spirited one must have health or a nervous\nsystem diseased in some of the ways that cause constant\nirritation.  The disease called poverty is not an irritant, but\nan anesthetic.  If Susan had been born to that life, her\nnaturally vivacious temperament would have made her gay in\nunconscious wretchedness; as it was, she knew her own misery\nand suffered from it keenly--at times hideously--yet was\nrapidly losing the power to revolt.\n\nPerhaps it was the wind--yes, it must have been the wind with\nits threat of winter--that roused her sluggish blood, that\nwhipped thought into action.  Anything--anything would be right,\nif it promised escape.  Right--wrong!  Hypocritical words for\ncomfortable people!\n\nThat Friday night, after her supper of half-cooked corn meal\nand tea, she went instantly to work at washing out clothes.\nMrs. Tucker spent the evening gossiping with the janitress,\ncame in about midnight.  As usual she was full to the brim with\nnews of misery--of jobs lost, abandoned wives, of abused\nchildren, of poisoning from rotten \"fresh\" food or from\n\"embalmed\" stuff in cans, of sickness and yet more sickness, of\nmaiming accidents, of death--news that is the commonplace of\ntenement life.  She loved to tell these tales with all the\nharrowing particulars and to find in each some evidence of the\ngoodness of God to herself.  Often Susan could let her run on\nand on without listening.  But not that night.  She resisted\nthe impulse to bid her be silent, left the room and stood at\nthe hall window.  When she returned Mrs. Tucker was in bed, was\nsnoring in a tranquillity that was the reverse of contagious.\nWith her habitual cheerfulness she had adapted herself to her\nchanged condition without fretting.  She had become as ragged\nand as dirty as her neighbors; she so wrought upon Susan's\nsensibilities, blunted though they were, that the girl would\nhave been unable to sleep in the same bed if she had not always\nbeen tired to exhaustion when she lay down.  But for that\nmatter only exhaustion could have kept her asleep in that\nvermin-infested hole.  Even the fiercest swarms of the insects\nthat flew or ran or crawled and bit, even the filthy mice\nsqueaking as they played upon the covers or ran over the faces\nof the sleepers, did not often rouse her.\n\nWhile Mrs. Tucker snored, Susan worked on, getting every piece\nof at all fit clothing in her meager wardrobe into the best\npossible condition.  She did not once glance at the face of the\nnoisy sleeper--a face homely enough in Mrs. Tucker's waking\nhours, hideous now with the mouth open and a few scattered\nrotten teeth exposed, and the dark yellow-blue of the unhealthy\ngums and tongue.\n\nAt dawn Mrs. Tucker awoke with a snort and a start.  She rubbed\nher eyes with her dirty and twisted and wrinkled fingers--the\nnails were worn and broken, turned up as if warped at the\nedges, blackened with dirt and bruisings.  \"Why, are you up\nalready?\" she said to Susan.\n\n\"I've not been to bed,\" replied the girl.\n\nThe woman stretched herself, sat up, thrust her thick,\nstockinged legs over the side of the bed.  She slept in all her\nclothing but her skirt, waist, and shoes.  She kneeled down\nupon the bare, sprung, and slanting floor, said a prayer, arose\nwith a beaming face.  \"It's nice and warm in the room.  How I\ndo dread the winter, the cold weather--though no doubt we'll\nmake out all right!  Everything always does turn out well for\nme.  The Lord takes care of me.  I must make me a cup of tea.\"\n\n\"I've made it,\" said Susan.\n\nThe tea was frightful stuff--not tea at all, but cheap\nadulterants colored poisonously.  Everything they got was of\nthe same quality; yet the prices they paid for the tiny\nquantities they were able to buy at any one time were at a rate\nthat would have bought the finest quality at the most expensive\ngrocery in New York.\n\n\"Wonder why Mrs. Reardon don't come?\" said Mrs. Tucker.  Mrs.\nReardon had as her only work a one night job at scrubbing.\n\"She ought to have come an hour ago.\"\n\n\"Her rheumatism was bad when she started,\" said Susan.  \"I\nguess she worked slow.\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Tucker had finished her second cup she put on her\nshoes, overskirt and waist, made a few passes at her hair.\nShe was ready to go to work.\n\nSusan looked at her, murmured:  \"An honest, God-fearing working woman!\"\n\n\"Huh?\" said Mrs. Tucker.\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied Susan who would not have permitted her to\nhear.  It would be cruel to put such ideas before one doomed\nbeyond hope.\n\nSusan was utterly tired, but even the strong craving for a\nstimulant could not draw that tea past her lips.  She ate a\npiece of dry bread, washed her face, neck, and hands.  It was\ntime to start for the factory.\n\nThat day--Saturday--was a half-holiday.  Susan drew her week's\nearnings--four dollars and ten cents--and came home.  Mrs.\nTucker, who had drawn--\"thanks to the Lord\"--three dollars and\na quarter, was with her.  The janitress halted them as they\npassed and told them that Mrs. Reardon was dead.  She looked\nlike another scrubwoman, living down the street, who was known\nalways to carry a sum of money in her dress pocket, the banks\nbeing untrustworthy.  Mrs. Reardon, passing along in the dusk\nof the early morning, had been hit on the head with a\nblackjack.  The one blow had killed her.\n\nViolence, tragedy of all kinds, were too commonplace in that\nneighborhood to cause more than a slight ripple.  An old\nscrubwoman would have had to die in some peculiarly awful way\nto receive the flattery of agitating an agitated street.  Mrs.\nReardon had died what was really almost a natural death.  So\nthe faint disturbance of the terrors of life had long since\ndisappeared.  The body was at the Morgue, of course.\n\n\"We'll go up, right away,\" said Mrs. Tucker.\n\n\"I've something to do that can't be put, off,\" replied Susan.\n\n\"I don't like for anyone as young as you to be so hard,\"\nreproached Mrs. Tucker.\n\n\"Is it hard,\" said Susan, \"to see that death isn't nearly so\nterrible as life?  She's safe and at peace.  I've got to _live_.\"\n\nMrs. Tucker, eager for an emotional and religious opportunity,\nhastened away.  Susan went at her wardrobe ironing, darning,\nfixing buttonholes, hooks and eyes.  She drew a bucket of water\nfrom the tap in the hall and proceeded to wash her hair with\nsoap; she rinsed it, dried it as well as she could with their\none small, thin towel, left it hanging free for the air to\nfinish the job.\n\nIt had rained all the night before--the second heavy rain in\ntwo months.  But at dawn the rain had ceased, and the clouds\nhad fled before the sun that rules almost undisputed nine\nmonths of the year and wars valiantly to rule the other three\nmonths--not altogether in vain.  A few golden strays found\ntheir way into that cavelike room and had been helping her\nwonderfully.  She bathed herself and scrubbed herself from head\nto foot.  She manicured her nails, got her hands and feet into\nfairly good condition.  She put on her best underclothes, her\none remaining pair of undarned stockings, the pair of ties she\nhad been saving against an emergency.  And once more she had\nthe charm upon which she most prided herself--the charm of an\nattractive look about the feet and ankles.  She then took up\nthe dark-blue hat frame--one of a lot of \"seconds\"--she had\nbought for thirty-five cents at a bargain sale, trimmed it with\na broad dark-blue ribbon for which she had paid sixty cents.\nShe was well pleased--and justly so--with the result.  The\ntrimmed hat might well have cost ten or fifteen dollars--for\nthe largest part of the price of a woman's hat is usually the\ntaste of the arrangement of the trimming.\n\nBy this time her hair was dry.  She did it up with a care she\nhad not had time to give it in many a week.  She put on the\ndark-blue serge skirt of the between seasons dress she had\nbrought with her from Forty-fourth Street; she had not worn it\nat all.  With the feeble aid of the mirror that distorted her\nimage into grotesqueness, she put on her hat with the care that\nimportant detail of a woman's toilet always deserves.\n\nShe completed her toilet with her one good and unworn\nblouse--plain white, the yoke gracefully pointed--and with a\nblue neck piece she had been saving.  She made a bundle of all\nher clothing that was fit for anything--including the unworn\nbatiste dress Jeffries and Jonas had given her.  And into it\nshe put the pistol she had brought away from Forty-fourth\nStreet.  She made a separate bundle of the Jeffries and Jonas\nhat with its valuable plumes.  With the two bundles she\ndescended and went to a pawnshop in Houston Street, to which\nshe had made several visits.\n\nA dirty-looking man with a short beard fluffy and thick like a\nyellow hen's tail lurked behind the counter in the dark little\nshop.  She put her bundles on the counter, opened them.  \"How\nmuch can I get for these things?\" she asked.\n\nThe man examined every piece minutely.  \"There's really nothing\nhere but the summer dress and the hat,\" said he.  \"And they're\nout of style.  I can't give you more than four dollars for the\nlot--and one for the pistol which is good but old style now.\nFive dollars.  How'll you have it?\"\n\nSusan folded the things and tied up the bundles.  \"Sorry to\nhave troubled you,\" she said, taking one in either hand.\n\n\"How much did you expect to get, lady?\" asked the pawnbroker.\n\n\"Twenty-five dollars.\"\n\nHe laughed, turned toward the back of the shop.  As she reached\nthe door he called from his desk at which he seemed about to\nseat himself, \"I might squeeze you out ten dollars.\"\n\n\"The plumes on the hat will sell for thirty dollars,\" said\nSusan.  \"You know as well as I do that ostrich feathers have\ngone up.\"\n\nThe man slowly advanced.  \"I hate to see a customer go away\nunsatisfied,\" said he.  \"I'll give you twenty dollars.\"\n\n\"Not a cent less than twenty-five.  At the next place I'll ask\nthirty--and get it.\"\n\n\"I never can stand out against a lady.  Give me the stuff.\"\n\nSusan put it on the counter again.  Said she:\n\n\"I don't blame you for trying to do me.  You're right to try to\nbuy your way out of hell.\"\n\nThe pawnbroker reflected, could not understand this subtlety,\nwent behind his counter.  He produced a key from his pocket,\nunlocked a drawer underneath and took out a large tin box.\nWith another key from another pocket he unlocked this, threw\nback the lid revealing a disorder of papers.  From the depths\nhe fished a paper bag.  This contained a roll of bills.  He\ngave Susan a twenty and a five, both covered with dirt so\nthickly that she could scarcely make out the denominations.\n\n\"You'll have to give me cleaner money than this,\" said she.\n\n\"You are a fine lady,\" grumbled he.  But he found cleaner bills.\n\nShe turned to her room.  At sight of her Mrs. Tucker burst out\nlaughing with delight.  \"My, but you do look like old times!\"\ncried she.  \"How neat and tasty you are!  I suppose it's no\nneed to ask if you're going to church?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan.  \"I've got nothing to give, and I don't beg.\"\n\n\"Well, I ain't going there myself, lately--somehow.  They got\nso they weren't very cordial--or maybe it was me thinking that\nway because I wasn't dressed up like.  Still I do wish you was\nmore religious.  But you'll come to it, for you're naturally a\ngood girl.  And when you do, the Lord'll give you a more\ncontented heart.  Not that you complain.  I never knew anybody,\nespecially a young person, that took things so quiet.  .  .  .\nIt can't be you're going to a dance?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan.  \"I'm going to leave--go back uptown.\"\n\nMrs. Tucker plumped down upon the bed.  \"Leave for good?\" she gasped.\n\n\"I've got Nelly Lemayer to take my place here, if you want her,\"\nsaid Susan.  \"Here is my share of the rent for next week and\nhalf a dollar for the extra gas I've burned last night and today.\"\n\n\"And Mrs. Reardon gone, too!\" sobbed Mrs. Tucker, suddenly\nremembering the old scrubwoman whom both had forgotten.  \"And\nup to that there Morgue they wouldn't let me see her except\nwhere the light was so poor that I couldn't rightly swear it\nwas her.  How brutal everybody is to the poor!  If they didn't\nhave the Lord, what would become of them!  And you leaving me\nall alone!\"\n\nThe sobs rose into hysteria.  Susan stood impassive.  She had\nseen again and again how faint the breeze that would throw\nthose shallow waters into commotion and how soon they were\ntranquil again.  It was by observing Mrs. Tucker that she first\nlearned an important unrecognized truth about human nature that\namiable, easily sympathetic and habitually good-humored people\nare invariably hard of heart.  In this parting she had no sense\nof loss, none of the melancholy that often oppresses us when we\nseparate from someone to whom we are indifferent yet feel bound\nby the tie of misfortunes borne together.  Mrs. Tucker, fallen\ninto the habits of their surroundings, was for her simply part\nof them.  And she was glad she was leaving them--forever, she\nhoped.  _Christian_, fleeing the City of Destruction, had no\nsterner mandate to flight than her instinct was suddenly urging\nupon her.\n\nWhen Mrs. Tucker saw that her tears were not appreciated, she\ndecided that they were unnecessary.  She dried her eyes and said:\n\n\"Anyhow, I reckon Mrs. Reardon's taking-off was a mercy.\"\n\n\"She's better dead,\" said Susan.  She had abhorred the old\nwoman, even as she pitied and sheltered her.  She had a way of\nfawning and cringing and flattering--no doubt in well meaning\nattempt to show gratitude--but it was unendurable to Susan.\nAnd now that she was dead and gone, there was no call for\nfurther pretenses.\n\n\"You ain't going right away?\" said Mrs. Tucker.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan.\n\n\"You ought to stay to supper.\"\n\nSupper!  That revolting food!  \"No, I must go right away,\"\nreplied Susan.\n\n\"Well, you'll come to see me.  And maybe you'll be back with\nus.  You might go farther and do worse.  On my way from the\nmorgue I dropped in to see a lady friend on the East Side.  I\nguess the good Lord has abandoned the East Side, there being\nnothing there but Catholics and Jews, and no true religion.\nIt's dreadful the way things is over there--the girls are\ntaking to the streets in droves.  My lady friend was telling me\nthat some of the mothers is sending their little girls out\nstreetwalking, and some's even taking out them that's too young\nto be trusted to go alone.  And no money in it, at that.  And\nfood and clothing prices going up and up.  Meat and vegetables\ntwo and three times what they was a few years ago.  And rents!\"\nMrs. Tucker threw up her hands.\n\n\"I must be going,\" said Susan.  \"Good-by.\"\n\nShe put out her hand, but Mrs. Tucker insisted on kissing her.\nShe crossed Washington Square, beautiful in the soft evening\nlight, and went up Fifth Avenue.  She felt that she was\nbreathing the air of a different world as she walked along the\nbroad clean sidewalk with the handsome old houses on either\nside, with carriages and automobiles speeding past, with clean,\nhappy-faced, well dressed human beings in sight everywhere.  It\nwas like coming out of the dank darkness of Dismal Swamp into\nsmiling fields with a pure, star-spangled sky above.  She was\nfree--free!  It might be for but a moment; still it was freedom,\ninfinitely sweet because of past slavery and because of the\nfear of slavery closing in again.  She had abandoned the old\ntoilet articles.  She had only the clothes she was wearing, the\nthirty-one dollars divided between her stockings, and the\ntwo-dollar bill stuffed into the palm of her left glove.\n\nShe had walked but a few hundred feet.  She had advanced into\na region no more prosperous to the eye than that she had been\nworking in every day.  Yet she had changed her world--because\nshe had changed her point of view.  The strata that form\nsociety lie in roughly parallel lines one above the other.  The\nflow of all forms of the currents of life is horizontally along\nthese strata, never vertically from one stratum to another.\nThese strata, lying apparently in contact, one upon another,\nare in fact abysmally separated.  There is not--and in the\nnature of things never can be any genuine human sympathy\nbetween any two strata.  We _sympathize_ in our own stratum, or\nclass; toward other strata--other classes--our attitude is\nnecessarily a looking up or a looking down.  Susan, a bit of\nflotsam, ascending, descending, ascending across the social\nlayers--belonging nowhere having attachments, not sympathies,\na real settled lot nowhere--Susan was once more upward bound.\n\nAt the corner of Fourteenth Street there was a shop with large\nmirrors in the show windows.  She paused to examine herself.\nShe found she had no reason to be disturbed about her\nappearance.  Her dress and hat looked well; her hair was\nsatisfactory; the sharp air had brought some life to the pallor\nof her cheeks, and the release from the slums had restored some\nof the light to her eyes.  \"Why did I stay there so long?\" she\ndemanded of herself.  Then, \"How have I suddenly got the\ncourage to leave?\" She had no answer to either question.  Nor\ndid she care for an answer.  She was not even especially\ninterested in what was about to happen to her.\n\nThe moment she found herself above Twenty-third Street and in\nthe old familiar surroundings, she felt an irresistible longing\nto hear about Rod Spenser.  She was like one who has been on a\nfar journey, leaving behind him everything that has been life\nto him; he dismisses it all because he must, until he finds\nhimself again in his own country, in his old surroundings.\nShe went into the Hoffman House and at the public telephone\ngot the _Herald_ office.  \"Is Mr. Drumley there?\"\n\n\"No,\" was the reply.  \"He's gone to Europe.\"\n\n\"Did Mr. Spenser go with him?\"\n\n\"Mr. Spenser isn't here--hasn't been for a long time.  He's\nabroad too.  Who is this?\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Susan, hanging up the receiver.\n\nShe drew a deep breath of relief.\n\nShe left the hotel by the women's entrance in Broadway.  It was\nsix o'clock.  The sky was clear--a typical New York sky with\nair that intoxicated blowing from it--air of the sea--air of\nthe depths of heaven.  A crescent moon glittered above the\nDiana on the Garden tower.  It was Saturday night and Broadway\nwas thronged--with men eager to spend in pleasure part of the\nweek's wages or salary they had just drawn; with women\nsparkling-eyed and odorous of perfumes and eager to help the\nmen.  The air was sharp--was the ocean air of New York at its\ndelicious best.  And the slim, slightly stooped girl with the\nearnest violet-gray eyes and the sad bitter mouth from whose\nlips the once brilliant color had now fled was ready for\nwhatever might come.  She paused at the corner, and gazed up\nbrilliantly lighted Broadway.\n\n\"Now!\" she said half aloud and, like an expert swimmer\nadventuring the rapids, she advanced into the swift-moving\ncrowd of the highway of New York's gayety.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nAT the corner of Twenty-sixth Street a man put himself squarely\nacross her path.  She was attracted by the twinkle in his\ngood-natured eyes.  He was a youngish man, had the stoutness of\nindulgence in a fondness for eating and drinking--but the\nstoutness was still well within the bounds of decency.  His\nclothing bore out the suggestion of his self-assured way of\nstopping her--the suggestion of a confidence-giving prosperity.\n\n\"You look as if you needed a drink, too,\" said he.  \"How about\nit, lady with the lovely feet?\"\n\nFor the first time in her life she was feeling on an equality\nwith man.  She gave him the same candidly measuring glance that\nman gives man.  She saw good-nature, audacity without\nimpudence--at least not the common sort of impudence.  She\nsmiled merrily, glad of the chance to show her delight that she\nwas once more back in civilization after the long sojourn in\nthe prison workshops where it is manufactured.  She said:\n\n\"A drink?  Thank you--yes.\"\n\n\"That's a superior quality of smile you've got there,\" said he.\n\"That, and those nice slim feet of yours ought to win for you\nanywhere.  Let's go to the Martin.\"\n\n\"Down University Place?\"\n\nThe stout young man pointed his slender cane across the street.\n\"You must have been away.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the girl.  \"I've been--dead.\"\n\n\"I'd like to try that myself--if I could be sure of coming to\nlife in little old New York.\"  And he looked round with\nlaughing eyes as if the lights, the crowds, the champagne-like\nair intoxicated him.\n\nAt the first break in the thunderous torrent of traffic they\ncrossed Broadway and went in at the Twenty-sixth Street\nentrance.  The restaurant, to the left, was empty.  Its little\ntables were ready, however, for the throng of diners soon to\ncome.  Susan had difficulty in restraining herself.  She was\nalmost delirious with delight.  She was agitated almost to\ntears by the freshness, the sparkle in the glow of the\nred-shaded candles, in the colors and odors of the flowers\ndecorating every table.  While she had been down there all this\nhad been up here--waiting for her!  Why had she stayed down\nthere?  But then, why had she gone?  What folly, what madness!\nTo suffer such horrors for no reason--beyond some vague,\nclinging remnant of a superstition--or had it been just plain\ninsanity?  \"Yes, I've been crazy--out of my head.  The break\nwith--Rod--upset my mind.\"\n\nHer companion took her into the café to the right.  He seated\nher on one of the leather benches not far from the door, seated\nhimself in a chair opposite; there was a narrow marble-topped\ntable between them.  On Susan's right sat a too conspicuously\ndressed but somehow important looking actress; on her left, a\nshopkeeper's fat wife.  Opposite each woman sat the sort of man\none would expect to find with her.  The face of the actress's\nman interested her.  It was a long pale face, the mouth weary,\nin the eyes a strange hot fire of intense enthusiasm.  He was\nyoung--and old--and neither.  Evidently he had lived every\nminute of every year of his perhaps forty years.  He was\nwearing a quiet suit of blue and his necktie was of a darker\nshade of the same color.  His clothes were draped upon his good\nfigure with a certain fascinating distinction.  He was smoking\nan unusually long and thick cigarette.  The slender strong\nwhite hand he raised and lowered was the hand of an artist.  He\nmight be a bad man, a very bad man--his face had an expression\nof freedom, of experience, that made such an idea as\nconventionality in connection with him ridiculous.  But however\nbad he might be, Susan felt sure it would be an artistic kind\nof badness, without vulgarity.  He might have reached the stage\nat which morality ceases to be a conviction, a matter of\nconscience, and becomes a matter of preference, of tastes--and\nhe surely had good taste in conduct no less than in dress and\nmanner.  The woman with him evidently wished to convince him\nthat she loved him, to convince those about her that they were\nlovers; the man evidently knew exactly what she had in\nmind--for he was polite, attentive, indifferent, and--Susan\nsuspected--secretly amused.\n\nSusan's escort leaned toward her and said in a low tone, \"The\ntwo at the next table--the woman's Mary Rigsdall, the actress,\nand the man's Brent, the fellow who writes plays.\"  Then in a\nless cautious tone, \"What are you drinking?\"\n\n\"What are _you_ drinking?\" asked Susan, still covertly watching Brent.\n\n\"You are going to dine with me?\"\n\n\"I've no engagement.\"\n\n\"Then let's have Martinis--and I'll go get a table and order\ndinner while the waiter's bringing them.\"\n\nWhen Susan was alone, she gazed round the crowded café, at the\nscores of interesting faces--thrillingly interesting to her\nafter her long sojourn among countenances merely expressing\ncrude elemental appetites if anything at all beyond toil,\nanxiety, privation, and bad health.  These were the faces of\nthe triumphant class--of those who had wealth or were getting\nit, fame or were striving for it, of those born to or acquiring\nposition of some sort among the few thousands who lord it over\nthe millions.  These were the people among whom she belonged.\nWhy was she having such a savage struggle to attain it?  Then,\nall in an instant the truth she had been so long groping for in\nvain flung itself at her.  None of these women, none of the\nwomen of the prosperous classes would be there but for the\nassistance and protection of the men.  She marveled at her\nstupidity in not having seen the obvious thing clearly long\nago.  The successful women won their success by disposing of\ntheir persons to advantage--by getting the favor of some man of\nability.  Therefore, she, a woman, must adopt that same policy\nif she was to have a chance at the things worth while in life.\nShe must make the best bargain--or series of bargains--she\ncould.  And as her necessities were pressing she must lose no\ntime.  She understood now the instinct that had forced her to\nfly from South Fifth Avenue, that had overruled her hesitation\nand had compelled her to accept the good-natured, prosperous\nman's invitation.  .  .  .  There was no other way open to her.\nShe must not evade that fact; she must accept it.  Other ways\nthere might be--for other women.  But not for her, the outcast\nwithout friends or family, the woman alone, with no one to lean\nupon or to give her anything except in exchange for what she\nhad to offer that was marketable.  She must make the bargain\nshe could, not waste time in the folly of awaiting a bargain to\nher liking.  Since she was living in the world and wished to\ncontinue to live there, she must accept the world's terms.  To\nbe sad or angry either one because the world did not offer her\nas attractive terms as it apparently offered many other\nwomen--the happy and respected wives and mothers of the\nprosperous classes, for instance--to rail against that was\nsilly and stupid, was unworthy of her intelligence.  She would\ndo as best she could, and move along, keeping her eyes open;\nand perhaps some day a chance for much better terms might\noffer--for the best--for such terms as that famous actress\nthere had got.  She looked at Mary Rigsdall.  An expression in\nher interesting face--the latent rather than the surface\nexpression--set Susan to wondering whether, if she knew\nRigsdall's _whole_ story--or any woman's whole story--she might\nnot see that the world was not bargaining so hardly with her,\nafter all.  Or any man's whole story.  There her eyes shifted\nto Rigsdall's companion, the famous playwright of whom she had\nso often heard Rod and his friends talk.\n\nShe was startled to find that his gaze was upon her--an\nall-seeing look that penetrated to the very core of her being.\nHe either did not note or cared nothing about her color of\nembarrassment.  He regarded her steadily until, so she felt, he\nhad seen precisely what she was, had become intimately\nacquainted with her.  Then he looked away.  It chagrined her\nthat his eyes did not again turn in her direction; she felt\nthat he had catalogued her as not worth while.  She listened to\nthe conversation of the two.  The woman did the talking, and\nher subject was herself--her ability as an actress, her\nconception of some part she either was about to play or was\nhoping to play.  Susan, too young to have acquired more than\nthe rudiments of the difficult art of character study, even had\nshe had especial talent for it--which she had not--Susan\ndecided that the famous Rigsdall was as shallow and vain as Rod\nhad said all stage people were.\n\nThe waiter brought the cocktails and her stout young companion\ncame back, beaming at the thought of the dinner he had\npainstakingly ordered.  As he reached the table he jerked his\nhead in self-approval.  \"It'll be a good one,\" said he.\n\"Saturday night dinner--and after--means a lot to me.  I work\nhard all week.  Saturday nights I cut loose.  Sundays I sleep\nand get ready to scramble again on Monday for the dollars.\"  He\nseated himself, leaned toward her with elevated glass.  \"What\nname?\" inquired he.\n\n\"Susan.\"\n\n\"That's a good old-fashioned name.  Makes me see the\nhollyhocks, and the hens scratching for worms.  Mine's Howland.\nBilly Howland.  I came from Maryland .  .  .  and I'm mighty\nglad I did.  I wouldn't be from anywhere else for worlds, and\nI wouldn't be there for worlds.  Where do you hail from?\"\n\n\"The West,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Well, the men in your particular corner out yonder must be a\npretty poor lot to have let you leave.  I spotted you for mine\nthe minute I saw you--Susan.  I hope you're not as quiet as\nyour name.  Another cocktail?\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\"Like to drink?\"\n\n\"I'm going to do more of it hereafter.\"\n\n\"Been laying low for a while--eh?\"\n\n\"Very low,\" said Susan.  Her eyes were sparkling now; the\ncocktail had begun to stir her long languid blood.\n\n\"Live with your family?\"\n\n\"I haven't any.  I'm free.\"\n\n\"On the stage?\"\n\n\"I'm thinking of going on.\"\n\n\"And meanwhile?\"\n\n\"Meanwhile--whatever comes.\"\n\nBilly Howland's face was radiant.  \"I had a date tonight and\nthe lady threw me down.  One of those drummer's wives that take\nin washing to add to the family income while hubby's flirting\nround the country.  This hubby came home unexpectedly.  I'm\nglad he did.\"\n\nHe beamed with such whole-souled good-nature that Susan\nlaughed.  \"Thanks.  Same to you,\" said she.\n\n\"Hope you're going to do a lot of that laughing,\" said he.\n\"It's the best I've heard--such a quiet, gay sound.  I sure do\nhave the best luck.  Until five years ago there was nothing\ndoing for Billy--hall bedroom--Wheeling stogies--one shirt and\ntwo pairs of cuffs a week--not enough to buy a lady an\nice-cream soda.  All at once--bang!  The hoodoo busted, and\neverything that arrived was for William C. Howland.  Better\nget aboard.\"\n\n\"Here I am.\"\n\n\"Hold on tight.  I pay no attention to the speed laws, and\nround the corners on two wheels.  Do you like good things to eat?\"\n\n\"I haven't eaten for six months.\"\n\n\"You must have been out home.  Ah!--There's the man to tell us\ndinner's ready.\"\n\nThey finished the second cocktail.  Susan was pleased to note\nthat Brent was again looking at her; and she thought--though\nshe suspected it might be the cocktail--that there was a\nquestion in his look--a question about her which he had been\nunable to answer to his satisfaction.  When she and Howland\nwere at one of the small tables against the wall in the\nrestaurant, she said to him:\n\n\"You know Mr. Brent?\"\n\n\"The play man?  Lord, no.  I'm a plain business dub.  He\nwouldn't bother with me.  You like that sort of man?\"\n\n\"I want to get on the stage, if I can,\" was Susan's diplomatic reply.\n\n\"Well--let's have dinner first.  I've ordered champagne, but if\nyou prefer something else----\"\n\n\"Champagne is what I want.  I hope it's very dry.\"\n\nHowland's eyes gazed tenderly at her.  \"I do like a woman who\nknows the difference between champagne and carbonated sirup.\nI think you and I've got a lot of tastes in common.  I like\neating--so do you.  I like drinking--so do you.  I like a good\ntime--so do you.  You're a little bit thin for my taste, but\nyou'll fatten up.  I wonder what makes your lips so pale.\"\n\n\"I'd hate to remind myself by telling you,\" said Susan.\n\nThe restaurant was filling.  Most of the men and women were in\nevening dress.  Each arriving woman brought with her a new\nexhibition of extravagance in costume, diffused a new variety\nof powerful perfume.  The orchestra in the balcony was playing\nwaltzes and the liveliest Hungarian music and the most sensuous\nstrains from Italy and France and Spain.  And before her was\nfood!--food again!--not horrible stuff unfit for beasts, worse\nthan was fed to beasts, but human food--good things, well\ncooked and well served.  To have seen her, to have seen the\nexpression of her eyes, without knowing her history and without\nhaving lived as she had lived, would have been to think her a\nglutton.  Her spirits giddied toward the ecstatic.  She began\nto talk--commenting on the people about her--the one subject she\ncould venture with her companion.  As she talked and drank, he\nate and drank, stuffing and gorging himself, but with a\nfrankness of gluttony that delighted her.  She found she could\nnot eat much, but she liked to see eating; she who had so long\nbeen seeing only poverty, bolting wretched food and drinking\nthe vilest kinds of whiskey and beer, of alleged coffee and\ntea--she reveled in Howland's exhibition.  She must learn to\nlive altogether in her senses, never to think except about an\nappetite.  Where could she find a better teacher? . . .\nThey drank two quarts of champagne, and with the coffee she\ntook _crême de menthe_ and he brandy.  And as the sensuous\ntemperament that springs from intense vitality reasserted\nitself, the opportunity before her lost all its repellent\nfeatures, became the bright, vivid countenance of lusty youth,\nirradiating the joy of living.\n\n\"I hear there's a lively ball up at Terrace Garden,\" said he.\n\"Want to go?\"\n\n\"That'll be fine!\" cried she.\n\nShe saw it would have taken nearly all the money she possessed\nto have paid that bill.  About four weeks' wages for one\ndinner!  Thousands of families living for two weeks on what she\nand he had consumed in two hours!  She reached for her half\nempty champagne glass, emptied it.  She must forget all those\nthings!  \"I've played the fool once.  I've learned my lesson.\nSurely I'll never do it again.\"  As she drank, her eyes chanced\nupon the clock.  Half-past ten.  Mrs. Tucker had probably just\nfallen asleep.  And Mrs. Reardon was going out to scrub--going\nout limping and groaning with rheumatism.  No, Mrs. Reardon was\nlying up at the morgue dead, her one chance to live lost\nforever.  Dead!  Yet better off than Mrs. Tucker lying alive.\nSusan could see her--the seamed and broken and dirty old\nremnant of a face--could see the vermin--and the mice could\nhear the snoring--the angry grunt and turning over as the\ninsects----\n\n\"I want another drink--right away,\" she cried.\n\n\"Sure!\" said Howland.  \"I need one more, too.\"\n\nThey drove in a taxi to Terrace Garden, he holding her in his\narms and kissing her with an intoxicated man's enthusiasm.\n\"You certainly are sweet,\" said he.  \"The wine on your breath\nis like flowers.  Gosh, but I'm glad that husband came home!\nLike me a little?\"\n\n\"I'm so happy, I feel like standing up and screaming,\" declared she.\n\n\"Good idea,\" cried he.  Whereupon he released a war whoop and\nthey both went off into a fit of hysterical laughter.  When it\nsubsided he said, \"I sized you up as a live wire the minute I\nsaw you.  But you're even better than I thought.  What are you\nin such a good humor about?\"\n\n\"You couldn't understand if I told you,\" replied she.  \"You'd\nhave to go and live where I've been living--live there as long\nas I have.\"\n\n\"Convent?\"\n\n\"Worse.  Worse than a jail.\"\n\nThe ball proved as lively as they hoped.  A select company from\nthe Tenderloin was attending, and the regulars were all of the\ngayest crowd among the sons and daughters of artisans and small\nmerchants up and down the East Side.  Not a few of the women\nwere extremely pretty.  All, or almost all, were young, and\nthose who on inspection proved to be older than eighteen or\ntwenty were acting younger than the youngest.  Everyone had\nbeen drinking freely, and continued to drink.  The orchestra\nplayed continuously.  The air was giddy with laughter and song.\nCouples hugged and kissed in corners, and finally openly on the\ndancing floor.  For a while Susan and Howland danced together.\nBut soon they made friends with the crowd and danced with\nwhoever was nearest.  Toward three in the morning it flashed\nupon her that she had not even seen him for many a dance.  She\nlooked round--searched for him--got a blond-bearded man in\nevening dress to assist her.\n\n\"The last seen of your stout friend,\" this man finally\nreported, \"he was driving away in a cab with a large lady from\nBroadway.  He was asleep, but I guess she wasn't.\"\n\nA sober thought winked into her whirling brain--he had warned\nher to hold on tight, and she had lost her head--and her\nopportunity.  A bad start--a foolishly bad start.  But out\nwinked the glimpse of sobriety and Susan laughed.  \"That's the\nlast I'll ever see of _him_,\" said she.\n\nThis seemed to give Blond-Beard no regrets.  Said he:  \"Let's\nyou and I have a little supper.  I'd call it breakfast, only\nthen we couldn't have champagne.\"\n\nAnd they had supper--six at the table, all uproarious, Susan\nwith difficulty restrained from a skirt dance on the table up\nand down among the dishes and bottles.  It was nearly five\no'clock when she and Blond-Beard helped each other toward a cab.\n\n\"What's your address?\" said he.\n\n\"The same as yours,\" replied she drowsily.\n\n\nLate that afternoon she established herself in a room with a\nbath in West Twenty-ninth Street not far from Broadway.  The\nexterior of the house was dingy and down-at-the-heel.  But the\ninterior was new and scrupulously clean.  Several other young\nwomen lived there alone also, none quite so well installed as\nSusan, who had the only private bath and was paying twelve\ndollars a week.  The landlady, frizzled and peroxide,\nexplained--without adding anything to what she already\nknew--that she could have \"privileges,\" but cautioned her\nagainst noise.  \"I can't stand for it,\" said she.  \"First\noffense--out you go.  This house is for ladies, and only\ngentlemen that know how to conduct themselves as a gentleman\nshould with a lady are allowed to come here.\"\n\nSusan paid a week in advance, reducing to thirty-one dollars\nher capital which Blond-Beard had increased to forty-three.\nThe young lady who lived at the other end of the hall smiled at\nher, when both happened to glance from their open doors at the\nsame time.  Susan invited her to call and she immediately\nadvanced along the hall in the blue silk kimono she was wearing\nover her nightgown.\n\n\"My name's Ida Driscoll,\" said she, showing a double row of\ncharming white teeth--her chief positive claim to beauty.\n\nShe was short, was plump about the shoulders but slender in the\nhips.  Her reddish brown hair was neatly done over a big rat,\nand was so spread that its thinness was hidden well enough to\ndeceive masculine eyes.  Nor would a man have observed that one\nof her white round shoulders was full two inches higher than\nthe other.  Her skin was good, her features small and\nirregular, her eyes shrewd but kindly.\n\n\"My name's\"--Susan hesitated--\"Lorna Sackville.\"\n\n\"I guess Lorna and Ida'll be enough for us to bother to\nremember,\" laughed Miss Driscoll.  \"The rest's liable to\nchange.  You've just come, haven't you?\"\n\n\"About an hour ago.  I've got only a toothbrush, a comb, a\nwashrag and a cake of soap.  I bought them on my way here.\"\n\n\"Baggage lost--eh?\" said Ida, amused.\n\n\"No,\" admitted Susan.  \"I'm beginning an entire new deal.\"\n\n\"I'll lend you a nightgown.  I'm too short for my other things\nto fit you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I can get along.  What's good for a headache?  I'm nearly\ncrazy with it.\"\n\n\"Wine?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute.\"  Ida, with bedroom slippers clattering,\nhurried back to her room, returned with a bottle of bromo\nseltzer and in the bathroom fixed Susan a dose.  \"You'll feel\nall right in half an hour or so.  Gee, but you're swell--with\nyour own bathroom.\"\n\nSusan shrugged her shoulders and laughed.\n\nIda shook her head gravely.  \"You ought to save your money.  I do.\"\n\n\"Later--perhaps.  Just now--I _must_ have a fling.\"\n\nIda seemed to understand.  She went on to say:  \"I was in\nmillinery.  But in this town there's nothing in anything unless\nyou have capital or a backer.  I got tired of working for five\nper, with ten or fifteen as the top notch.  So I quit, kissed\nmy folks up in Harlem good-by and came down to look about.  As\nsoon as I've saved enough I'm going to start a business.  That'll\nbe about a couple of years--maybe sooner, if I find an angel.\"\n\n\"I'm thinking of the stage.\"\n\n\"Cut it out!\" cried Ida.  \"It's on the bum.  There's more money\nand less worry in straight sporting--if you keep respectable.\nOf course, there's nothing in out and out sporting.\"\n\n\"Oh, I haven't decided on anything.  My head is better.\"\n\n\"Sure!  If the dose I gave you don't knock it you can get one\nat the drug store two blocks up Sixth Avenue that'll do the\ntrick.  Got a dinner date?\"\n\n\"No.  I haven't anything on hand.\"\n\n\"I think you and I might work together,\" said Ida.  \"You're\nthin and tallish.  I'm short and fattish.  We'd catch 'em\ncoming and going.\"\n\n\"That sounds good,\" said Susan.\n\n\"You're new to--to the business?\"\n\n\"In a way--yes.\"\n\n\"I thought so.  We all soon get a kind of a professional look.\nYou haven't got it.  Still, so many dead respectable women\nimitate nowadays, and paint and use loud perfumes, that\nsporting women aren't nearly so noticeable.  Seems to me the\nmen's tastes even for what they want at home are getting louder\nand louder all the time.  They hate anything that looks slow.\nAnd in our business it's harder and harder to please them--except\nthe yaps from the little towns and the college boys.  A woman\nhas to be up to snuff if she gets on.  If she looks what she\nis, men won't have her--nor if she is what she looks.\"\n\nSusan had not lived where every form of viciousness is openly\ndiscussed and practiced, without having learned the things\nnecessary to a full understanding of Ida's technical phrases\nand references.  The liveliness that had come with the\ndeparture of the headache vanished.  To change the subject she\ninvited Ida to dine with her.\n\n\"What's the use of your spending money in a restaurant?\"\nobjected Ida.  \"You eat with me in my room.  I always cook\nmyself something when I ain't asked out by some one of my\ngentleman friends.  I can cook you a chop and warm up a can of\nFrench peas and some dandy tea biscuits I bought yesterday.\"\n\nSusan accepted the invitation, promising that when she was\nestablished she would reciprocate.  As it was about six, they\narranged to have the dinner at seven, Susan to dress in the\nmeantime.  The headache had now gone, even to that last\nheaviness which seems to be an ominous threat of a return.\nWhen she was alone, she threw off her clothes, filled the big\nbathtub with water as hot as she could stand it.  Into this she\ngently lowered herself until she was able to relax and recline\nwithout discomfort.  Then she stood up and with the soap and\nwashrag gave herself the most thorough scrubbing of her life.\nTime after time she soaped and rubbed and scrubbed, and dipped\nherself in the hot water.  When she felt that she had restored\nher body to some where near her ideal of cleanness, she let the\nwater run out and refilled the tub with even hotter water.  In\nthis she lay luxuriously, reveling in the magnificent\nsensations of warmth and utter cleanliness.  Her eyes closed;\na delicious languor stole over her and through her, soothing\nevery nerve.  She slept.\n\nShe was awakened by Ida, who had entered after knocking and\ncalling at the outer door in vain.  Susan slowly opened her\neyes, gazed at Ida with a soft dreamy smile.  \"You don't know\nwhat this means.  It seems to me I was never quite so\ncomfortable or so happy in my life.\"\n\n\"It's a shame to disturb you,\" said Ida.  \"But dinner's ready.\nDon't stop to dress first.  I'll bring you a kimono.\"\n\nSusan turned on the cold water, and the bath rapidly changed\nfrom warm to icy.  When she had indulged in the sense of cold\nas delightful in its way as the sense of warmth, she rubbed her\nglowing skin with a rough towel until she was rose-red from\nhead to foot.  Then she put on stockings, shoes and the pink\nkimono Ida had brought, and ran along the hall to dinner.  As\nshe entered Ida's room, Ida exclaimed, \"How sweet and pretty\nyou do look!  You sure ought to make a hit!\"\n\n\"I feel like a human being for the first time in--it seems\nyears--ages--to me.\"\n\n\"You've got a swell color--except your lips.  Have they always\nbeen pale like that?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I thought not.  It don't seem to fit in with your style.  You\nought to touch 'em up.  You look too serious and innocent,\nanyhow.  They make a rouge now that'll stick through\neverything--eating, drinking--anything.\"\n\nSusan regarded herself critically in the glass.  \"I'll see,\"\nshe said.\n\nThe odor of the cooking chops thrilled Susan like music.  She\ndrew a chair up to the table, sat in happy-go-lucky fashion,\nand attacked the chop, the hot biscuit, and the peas, with an\nenthusiasm that inspired Ida to imitation.  \"You know how to\ncook a chop,\" she said to Ida.  \"And anybody who can cook a\nchop right can cook.  Cooking's like playing the piano.  If you\ncan do the simple things perfectly, you're ready to do anything.\"\n\n\"Wait till I have a flat of my own,\" said Ida.  \"I'll show you\nwhat eating means.  And I'll have it, too, before very long.\nMaybe we'll live together.  I was to a fortune teller's\nyesterday.  That's the only way I waste money.  I go to fortune\ntellers nearly every day.  But then all the girls do.  You get\nyour money's worth in excitement and hope, whether there's\nanything in it or not.  Well, the fortune teller she said I was\nto meet a dark, slender person who was to change the whole\ncourse of my life--that all my troubles would roll away--and\nthat if any more came, they'd roll away, too.  My, but she did\ngive me a swell fortune, and only fifty cents!  I'll take you\nto her.\"\n\nIda made black coffee and the two girls, profoundly contented,\ndrank it and talked with that buoyant cheerfulness which\nbubbles up in youth on the slightest pretext.  In this case the\npretext was anything but slight, for both girls had health as\nwell as youth, had that freedom from harassing responsibility\nwhich is the chief charm of every form of unconventional life.\nAnd Susan was still in the first flush of the joy of escape\nfrom the noisome prison whose poisons had been corroding her,\nsoul and body.  No, poison is not a just comparison; what\npoison in civilization parallels, or even approaches, in\nsqualor, in vileness of food and air, in wretchedness of\nshelter and clothing, the tenement life that is really the\ntypical life of the city?  From time to time Susan, suffused\nwith the happiness that is too deep for laughter, too deep for\ntears even, gazed round like a dreamer at those cheerful\ncomfortable surroundings and drew a long breath--stealthily, as\nif she feared she would awaken and be again in South Fifth\nAvenue, of rags and filth, of hideous toil without hope.\n\n\"You'd better save your money to put in the millinery business\nwith me,\" Ida advised.  \"I can show you how to make a lot.\nSometimes I clear as high as a hundred a week, and I don't\noften fall below seventy-five.  So many girls go about this\nbusiness in a no account way, instead of being regular and\nbusiness-like.\"\n\nSusan strove to hide the feelings aroused by this practical\nstatement of what lay before her.  Those feelings filled her\nwith misgiving.  Was the lesson still unlearned?  Obviously Ida\nwas right; there must be plan, calculation, a definite line\nlaid out and held to, or there could not but be failure and\ndisaster.  And yet--Susan's flesh quivered and shrank away.\nShe struggled against it, but she could not conquer it.\nExperience had apparently been in vain; her character had\nremained unchanged.  .  .  .  She must compel herself.  She\nmust do what she had to do; she must not ruin everything by\nimitating the people of the tenements with their fatal habit of\nliving from day to day only, and taking no thought for the\nmorrow except fatuously to hope and dream that all would be well.\n\nWhile she was fighting with herself, Ida had been talking\non--the same subject.  When Susan heard again, Ida was saying:\n\n\"Now, take me, for instance.  I don't smoke or drink.  There's\nnothing in either one--especially drink.  Of course sometimes\na girl's got to drink.  A man watches her too close for her to\ndodge out.  But usually you can make him think you're as full\nas he is, when you really are cold sober.\"\n\n\"Do the men always drink when they--come with--with--us?\" asked Susan.\n\n\"Most always.  They come because they want to turn themselves\nloose.  That's why a girl's got to be careful not to make a man\nfeel nervous or shy.  A respectable woman's game is to be\nmodest and innocent.  With us, the opposite.  They're both\ngames; one's just as good as the other.\"\n\n\"I don't think I could get along at all--at this,\" confessed\nSusan with an effort, \"unless I drank too much--so that I was\nreckless and didn't care what happened.\"\n\nIda looked directly into her eyes; Susan's glance fell and a\nflush mounted.  After a pause Ida went on:\n\n\"A girl does feel that way at first.  A girl that marries as\nmost of them do--because the old ones are pushing her out of\nthe nest and she's got no place else to go--she feels the same\nway till she hardens to it.  Of course, you've got to get broke\ninto any business.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said Susan eagerly.  \"You are so sensible.  You must\nteach me.\"\n\n\"Common sense is a thing you don't often hear--especially about\ngetting on in the world.  But, as I was saying--one of my\ngentlemen friends is a lawyer--such a nice fellow--so liberal.\nGives me a present of twenty or twenty-five extra, you\nunderstand--every time he makes a killing downtown.  He asked\nme once how I felt when I started in; and when I told him, he\nsaid, 'That's exactly the way I felt the first time I won a\ncase for a client I knew was a dirty rascal and in the wrong.\nBut now--I take that sort of thing as easy as you do.' He says\nthe thing is to get on, no matter how, and that one way's as\ngood as another.  And he's mighty right.  You soon learn that\nin little old New York, where you've got to have the money  or\nyou get the laugh and the foot--the swift, hard kick.  Clean up\nafter you've arrived, he says--and don't try to keep clean\nwhile you're working--and don't stop for baths and things while\nyou're at the job.\"\n\nSusan was listening with every faculty she possessed.\n\n\"He says he talks the other sort of thing--the dope--the fake\nstuff--just as the rest of the hustlers do.  He says it's\nnecessary in order to keep the people fooled--that if they got\nwise to the real way to succeed, then there'd be nobody to rob\nand get rich off of.  Oh, he's got it right.  He's a smart one.\"\n\nThe sad, bitter expression was strong in Susan's face.\n\nAfter a pause, Ida went on:  \"If a girl's an ignorant fool or\nsqueamish, she don't get up in this business any more than in\nany other.  But if she keeps a cool head, and don't take lovers\nunless they pay their way, and don't drink, why she can keep\nher self-respect and not have to take to the streets.\"\n\nSusan lifted her head eagerly.  \"Don't have to take to the\nstreets?\" she echoed.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" declared Ida.  \"I very seldom let a man pick\nme up after dark--unless he looks mighty good.  I go out in the\ndaytime.  I pretend I'm an actress out of a job for the time\nbeing, or a forelady in a big shop who's taking a day or so\noff, or a respectable girl living with her parents.  I put a\nlot of money into clothes--quiet, ladylike clothes.  Mighty\ngood investment.  If you ain't got clothes in New York you\ncan't do any kind of business.  I go where a nice class of men\nhangs out, and I never act bold, but just flirt timidly, as so\nmany respectable girls or semi-respectables do.  But when a\ngirl plays that game, she has to be careful not to make a man\nthink he ain't expected to pay.  The town's choked full of men\non the lookout for what they call love--which means, for\nsomething cheap or, better still, free.  Men are just crazy\nabout themselves.  Nothing easier than to fool 'em--and\nnothing's harder than to make 'em think you ain't stuck on 'em.\nI tell you, a girl in our life has a chance to learn men.  They\nturn themselves inside out to us.\"\n\nSusan, silent, her thoughts flowing like a mill race, helped\nIda with the dishes.  Then they dressed and went together for\na walk.  It being Sunday evening, the streets were quiet.  They\nsauntered up Fifth Avenue as far as Fifty-ninth Street and\nback.  Ida's calm and sensible demeanor gave Susan much needed\ncourage every time a man spoke to them.  None of these men\nhappened to be up to Ida's standard, which was high.\n\n\"No use wasting time on snide people,\" explained she.  \"We\ndon't want drinks and a gush of loose talk, and I saw at a\nglance that was all those chappies were good for.\"\n\nThey returned home at half-past nine without adventure.  Toward\nmidnight one of Ida's regulars called and Susan was free to go\nto bed.  She slept hardly at all.  Ever before her mind hovered\na nameless, shapeless horror.  And when she slept she dreamed\nof her wedding night, woke herself screaming, \"Please, Mr.\nFerguson--please!\"\n\nIda had three chief sources of revenue.\n\nThe best was five men--her \"regular gentleman friends\"--who\ncalled by appointment from time to time.  These paid her ten\ndollars apiece, and occasionally gave her presents of money or\njewelry--nothing that amounted to much.  From them she averaged\nabout thirty-five dollars a week.  Her second source was a Mrs.\nThurston who kept in West Fifty-sixth Street near Ninth Avenue\na furnished-room house of the sort that is on the official--and\nalso the \"revenue\"--lists of the police and the anti-vice\nsocieties.  This lady had a list of girls and married women\nupon whom she could call.  Gentlemen using her house for\nrendezvous were sometimes disappointed by the ladies with whom\nthey were intriguing.  Again a gentleman grew a little weary of\nhis perhaps too respectable or too sincerely loving ladylove\nand appealed to Mrs. Thurston.  She kept her list of availables\nmost select and passed them off as women of good position\nwilling to supplement a small income, or to punish stingy\nhusbands or fathers and at the same time get the money they\nneeded for dress and bridge, for matinées and lunches.  Mrs.\nThurston insisted--and Ida was inclined to believe--that there\nwere genuine cases of this kind on the list.\n\n\"It's mighty hard for women with expensive tastes and small\nmeans to keep straight in New York,\" said she to Susan.  \"It\ncosts so much to live, and there are so many ways to spend\nmoney.  And they always have rich lady friends who set an\nextravagant pace.  They've got to dress--and to kind of keep up\ntheir end.  So--\" Ida laughed, went on:  \"Besides the city\nwomen are getting so they like a little sporty novelty as much\nas their brothers and husbands and fathers do.  Oh, I'm not\nashamed of my business any more.  We're as good as the others,\nand we're not hypocrites.  As my lawyer friend says,\neverybody's got to make a _good_ living, and good livings can't\nbe made on the ways that used to be called on the\nlevel--they're called damfool ways now.\"\n\nIda's third source of income was to her the most attractive\nbecause it had such a large gambling element in it.  This was\nher flirtations as a respectable woman in search of lively\namusement and having to take care not to be caught.  There are\nwomen of all kinds who delight in deceiving men because it\ngives them a sweet stealthy sense of superiority to the\ncondescending sex.  In women of the Ida class this pleasure\nbecomes as much a passion as it is in the respectable woman\nwhom her husband tries to enslave.  With Susan, another woman\nand one in need of education, Ida was simple and scrupulously\ntruthful.  But it would have been impossible for a man to get\ntruth as to anything from her.  She amused herself inventing\nplausible romantic stories about herself that she might enjoy\nthe gullibility of the boastfully superior and patronizing\nmale.  She was devoid of sentiment, even of passion.  Yet at\ntimes she affected both in the most extreme fashion.  And\nafterward, with peals of laughter, she would describe to Susan\nhow the man had acted, what an ass she had made of him.\n\n\"Men despise us,\" she said.  \"But it's nothing to the way I\ndespise them.  The best of them are rotten beasts when they\nshow themselves as they are.  And they haven't any mercy on us.\nIt's too ridiculous.  Men despise a man who is virtuous and a\nwoman who isn't.  What rot!\"\n\nShe deceived the \"regulars\" without taking the trouble to\nremember her deceptions.  They caught her lying so often that\nshe knew they thought her untruthful through and through.  But\nthis only gave her an opportunity for additional pleasure--the\npleasure of inventing lies that they would believe in spite of\ntheir distrust of her.  \"Anyhow,\" said she, \"haven't you\nnoticed the liars everybody's on to are always believed and\ntruthful people are doubted?\"\n\nUpon the men with whom she flirted, she practiced the highly\ncolored romances it would have been useless to try upon the\nregulars.  Her greatest triumph at this game was a hard luck\nstory she had told so effectively that the man had given her\ntwo hundred dollars.  Most of her romances turned about her own\nruin.  As a matter of fact, she had told Susan the exact truth\nwhen she said she had taken up her mode of life deliberately;\nshe had grown weary and impatient of the  increasing\npoverty of a family which, like so many of the artisan and\nsmall merchant and professional classes in this day of\nconcentrating wealth and spreading tastes for comfort and\nluxury, was on its way down from comfort toward or through the\ntenements.  She was a type of the recruits that are swelling\nthe prostitute class in ever larger numbers and are driving the\nprostitutes of the tenement class toward starvation--where they\nonce dominated the profession even to its highest ranks, even\nto the fashionable _cocotes_ who prey upon the second generation\nof the rich.  But Ida never told her lovers her plain and\ncommonplace tale of yielding to the irresistible pressure of\neconomic forces.  She had made men weep at her recital of her\nwrongs.  It had even brought her offers of marriage--none,\nhowever, worth accepting.\n\n\"I'd be a boob to marry a man with less than fifteen or twenty\nthousand a year, wouldn't I?\" said she.  \"Why, two of the\nmarried men who come to see me regularly give me more than they\ngive their wives for pin money.  And in a few years I'll be\nhaving my own respectable business, with ten thousand\nincome--maybe more--and as well thought of as the next woman.\"\n\nIda's dream was a house in the country, a fine flat in town, a\nhusband in some \"refined\" profession and children at high-class\nschools.  \"And I'll get there, don't you doubt it!\" exclaimed\nshe.  \"Others have--of course, you don't know about\nthem--they've looked out for that.  Yes, lots of others\nhave--but--well, just you watch your sister Ida.\"\n\nAnd Susan felt that she would indeed arrive.  Already she had\nseen that there was no difficulty such as she had once imagined\nabout recrossing the line to respectability.  The only real\nproblem in that matter was how to get together enough to make\nthe crossing worth while--for what was there in respectability\nwithout money, in a day when respectability had ceased to mean\nanything but money?\n\nIda wished to take her to Mrs. Thurston and get her a favored\nplace on the list.  Susan thanked her, but said, \"Not yet--not\nquite yet.\"  Ida suggested that they go out together as two\nyoung married women whose husbands had gone on the road.  Susan\nput her off from day to day.  Ida finally offered to introduce\nher to one of the regulars:  \"He's a nice fellow--knows how to\ntreat a lady in a gentlemanly way.  Not a bit coarse or\nfamiliar.\"  Susan would not permit this generosity.  And all\nthis time her funds were sinking.  She had paid a second week's\nrent, had bought cooking apparatus, some food supplies, some\nnecessary clothing.  She was down to a five-dollar bill and a\nlittle change.\n\n\"Look here, Lorna,\" said Ida, between remonstrance and\nexasperation, \"when _are_ you going to start in?\"\n\nSusan looked fixedly at her, said with a slow smile, \"When I\ncan't hold out another minute.\"\n\nIda tossed her head angrily.  \"You've got brains--more than I\nhave,\" she cried.  \"You've got every advantage for catching\nrich men--even a rich husband.  You're educated.  You speak and\nact and look refined.  Why you could pretend to be a howling\nfashionable swell.  You've got all the points.  But what have\nyou got 'em for?  Not to use that's certain.\"\n\n\"You can't be as disgusted with me as I am.\"\n\n\"If you're going to do a thing, why, _do_ it!\"\n\n\"That's what I tell myself.  But--I can't make a move.\"\n\nIda gave a gesture of despair.  \"I don't see what's to become\nof you.  And you could do _so_ well! . . .  Let me phone Mr.\nSterling.  I told him about you.  He's anxious to meet you.\nHe's fond of books--like you.  You'd like him.  He'd give up a\nlot to you, because you're classier than I am.\"\n\nSusan threw her arms round Ida and kissed her.  \"Don't bother\nabout me,\" she said.  \"I've got to act in my own foolish,\nstupid way.  I'm like a child going to school.  I've got to\nlearn a certain amount before I'm ready to do whatever it is\nI'm going to do.  And until I learn it, I can't do much of\nanything.  I thought I had learned in the last few months.  I\nsee I haven't.\"\n\n\"Do listen to sense, Lorna,\" pleaded Ida.  \"If you wait till\nthe last minute, you'll get left.  The time to get the money's\nwhen you have money.  And I've a feeling that you're not\nparticularly flush.\"\n\n\"I'll do the best I can.  And I can't move till I'm ready.\"\n\nMeanwhile she continued to search for work--work that would\nenable her to live _decently_, wages less degrading than the\nwages of shame.  In a newspaper she read an advertisement of a\ntheatrical agency.  Advertisements of all kinds read well;\nthose of theatrical agencies read--like the fairy tales that\nthey were.  However, she found in this particular offering of\ndazzling careers and salaries a peculiar phrasing that decided\nher to break the rule she had made after having investigated\nscores of this sort of offers.\n\nRod was abroad; anyhow, enough time had elapsed.  One of the\nmost impressive features of the effect of New York--meaning by\n\"New York\" only that small but significant portion of the four\nmillions that thinks--at least, after a fashion, and acts,\ninstead of being mere passive tools of whatever happens to turn\nup--the most familiar notable effect of this New York is the\nspeedy distinction in the newcomer of those illusions and\ndelusions about life and about human nature, about good and\nevil, that are for so many people the most precious and the\nonly endurable and beautiful thing in the world.  New York,\ndestroyer of delusions and cherished hypocrisies and pretenses,\ntherefore makes the broadly intelligent of its citizens hardy,\nmakes the others hard--and between the hardy and hard, between\nsense and cynicism, yawns a gulf like that between Absalom and\nDives.  Susan, a New Yorker now, had got the habit--in thought,\nat least--of seeing things with somewhat less distortion from\nthe actual.  She no longer exaggerated the importance of the\nRod-Susan episode.  She saw that in New York, where life is\ncrowded with events, everything in one's life, except death,\nbecomes incident, becomes episode, where in regions offering\nless to think about each rare happening took on an aspect of\nvast importance.  The Rod-Susan love adventure, she now saw,\nwas not what it would have seemed--therefore, would have\nbeen--in Sutherland, but was mere episode of a New York life,\ngiving its light and shade to a certain small part of the long,\nvariedly patterned fabric of her life, and of his, not\ndetermining the whole.  She saw that it was simply like a bend\nin the river, giving a new turn to current and course but not\nchanging the river itself, and soon left far behind and\nsucceeded by other bends giving each its equal or greater turn\nto the stream.\n\nRod had passed from her life, and she from his life.  Thus she\nwas free to begin her real career--the stage--if she could.  She\nwent to the suite of offices tenanted by Mr. Josiah Ransome.\nShe was ushered in to Ransome himself, instead of halting with\nunderlings.  She owed this favor to advantages which her lack\nof vanity and of self-consciousness prevented her from\nsurmising.  Ransome--smooth, curly, comfortable\nlooking--received her with a delicate blending of the paternal\nand the gallant.  After he had inspected her exterior with\nflattering attentiveness and had investigated her\nqualifications with a thoroughness that was convincing of\nsincerity he said:\n\n\"Most satisfactory!  I can make you an exceptional assurance.\nIf you register with me, I can guarantee you not less than\ntwenty-five a week.\"\n\nSusan hesitated long and asked many questions before she\nfinally--with reluctance paid the five dollars.  She felt\nashamed of her distrust, but might perhaps have persisted in it\nhad not Mr. Ransome said:\n\n\"I don't blame you for hesitating, my dear young lady.  And if\nI could I'd put you on my list without payment.  But you can\nsee how unbusiness-like that would be.  I am a substantial,\nold-established concern.  You--no doubt you are perfectly\nreliable.  But I have been fooled so many times.  I must not\nlet myself forget that after all I know nothing about you.\"\n\nAs soon as Susan had paid he gave her a list of vaudeville and\nmusical comedy houses where girls were wanted.  \"You can't fail\nto suit one of them,\" said he.  \"If not, come back here and get\nyour money.\"\n\nAfter two weary days of canvassing she went back to Ransome.\nHe was just leaving.  But he smiled genially, opened his desk\nand seated himself.  \"At your service,\" said he.  \"What luck?\"\n\n\"None,\" replied Susan.  \"I couldn't live on the wages they\noffered at the musical comedy places, even if I could get placed.\"\n\n\"And the vaudeville people?\"\n\n\"When I said I could only sing and not dance, they looked\ndiscouraged.  When I said I had no costumes they turned me down.\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" cried Ransome.  \"You mustn't be so easily beaten.\nYou must take dancing lessons--perhaps a few singing lessons,\ntoo.  And you must get some costumes.\"\n\n\"But that means several hundred dollars.\"\n\n\"Three or four hundred,\" said Ransome airily.  \"A matter of a\nfew weeks.\"\n\n\"But I haven't anything like that,\" said Susan.  \"I haven't so\nmuch as----\"\n\n\"I comprehend perfectly,\" interrupted Ransome.  She interested\nhim, this unusual looking girl, with her attractive mingling of\nyouth and experience.  Her charm that tempted people to give\nher at once the frankest confidences, moved him to go out of\nhis way to help her.  \"You haven't the money,\" he went on.\n\n\"You must have it.  So--I promised to place you, and I will.\nI don't usually go so far in assisting my clients.  It's not\noften necessary--and where it's necessary it's usually\nimprudent.  However--I'll give you the address of a flat where\nthere is a lady--a trustworthy, square sort, despite her--her\nprofession.  She will put you in the way of getting on a sound\nfinancial basis.\"\n\nRansome spoke in a matter-of-fact tone, like a man stating a\nsimple business proposition.  Susan understood.  She rose.  Her\nexpression was neither shock nor indignation; but it was none\nthe less a negative.\n\n\"It's the regular thing, my dear,\" urged Ransome.  \"To make a\nstart, to get in right, you can't afford to be squeamish.  The\nway I suggest is the simplest and most direct of several that\nall involve the same thing.  And the surest.  You look\nsteady-headed--self-reliant.  You look sensible----\"\n\nSusan smiled rather forlornly.  \"But I'm not,\" said she.  \"Not yet.\"\n\nRansome regarded her with a sympathy which she felt was\ngenuine.  \"I'm sorry, my dear.  I've done the best I can for\nyou.  You may think it a very poor best--and it is.  But\"--he\nshrugged his shoulders--\"I didn't make this world and its\nconditions for living.  I may say also that I'm not the\nresponsible party--the party in charge.  However----\"\n\nTo her amazement he held out a five-dollar bill.  \"Here's your\nfee back.\"  He laughed at her expression.  \"Oh, I'm not a\nrobber,\" said he.  \"I only wish I could serve you.  I didn't\nthink you were so--\" his eyes twinkled--\"so unreasonable, let\nus say.  Among those who don't know anything about life there's\nan impression that my sort of people are in the business of\ndragging women down.  Perhaps one of us occasionally does as\nbad--about a millionth part as bad--as the average employer of\nlabor who skims his profits from the lifeblood of his\nemployees.  But as a rule we folks merely take those that are\nfalling and help them to light easy--or even to get up again.\"\n\nSusan felt ashamed to take her money.  But he pressed it on\nher.  \"You'll need it,\" said he.  \"I know how it is with a girl\nalone and trying to get a start.  Perhaps later on you'll be\nmore in the mood where I can help you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Susan.\n\n\"But I hope not.  It'll take uncommon luck to pull you\nthrough--and I hope you'll have it.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Susan.  He took her hand, pressed it\nfriendlily--and she felt that he was a man with real good in\nhim, more good than many who would have shrunk from him in horror.\n\nShe was waiting for a thrust from fate.  But fate,\ndisappointing as usual, would not thrust.  It seemed bent on\nthe malicious pleasure of compelling her to degrade herself\ndeliberately and with calculation, like a woman marrying for\nsupport a man who refuses to permit her to decorate with any\nartificial floral concealments of faked-up sentiment the sordid\ntruth as to what she is about.  She searched within herself in\nvain for the scruple or sentiment or timidity or whatever it\nwas that held her back from the course that was plainly\ninevitable.  She had got down to the naked fundamentals of\ndecency and indecency that are deep hidden by, and for most of\nus under, hypocrisies of conventionality.  She had found out\nthat a decent woman was one who respected her body and her\nsoul, that an indecent woman was one who did not, and that\nmarriage rites or the absence of them, the absence of financial\nor equivalent consideration, or its presence, or its extent or\nits form, were all irrelevant non-essentials.  Yet--she\nhesitated, knowing the while that she was risking a greater\ndegradation, and a stupid and fatal folly to boot, by shrinking\nfrom the best course open to her--unless it were better to take\na dose of poison and end it all.  She probably would have done\nthat had she not been so utterly healthy, therefore overflowing\nwith passionate love of life.  Except in fiction suicide and\nhealth do not go together, however superhumanly sensitive the\nsore beset hero or heroine.  Susan was sensitive enough;\nwhenever she did things incompatible with our false and\nhypocritical and unscientific notions of sensitiveness,\nallowances should be made for her because of her superb and\ndauntless health.  If her physical condition had been morbid,\nher conduct might have been, would have been, very different.\n\nShe was still hesitating when Saturday night came round\nagain--swiftly despite long disheartening days, and wakeful\nawful nights.  In the morning her rent would be due.  She had\na dollar and forty-five cents.\n\nAfter dinner alone a pretense at dinner--she wandered the\nstreets of the old Tenderloin until midnight.  An icy rain was\nfalling.  Rains such as this--any rains except showers--were\nrare in the City of the Sun.  That rain by itself was enough to\nmake her downhearted.  She walked with head down and umbrella\nclose to her shoulders.  No one spoke to her.  She returned\ndripping; she had all but ruined her one dress.  She went to\nbed, but not to sleep.  About nine--early for that house she\nrose, drank a cup of coffee and ate part of a roll.  Her little\nstove and such other things as could not be taken along she\nrolled into a bundle, marked it, \"For Ida.\"  On a scrap of\npaper she wrote this note:\n\n\nDon't think I'm ungrateful, please.  I'm going without saying\ngood-by because I'm afraid if I saw you, you'd be generous\nenough to put up for me, and I'd be weak enough to accept.  And\nif I did that, I'd never be able to get strong or even to hold\nmy head up.  So--good-by.  I'll learn sooner or later--learn\nhow to live.  I hope it won't be too long--and that the teacher\nwon't be too hard on me.\n\nYes, I'll learn, and I'll buy fine hats at your grand millinery\nstore yet.  Don't forget me altogether.\n\n\nShe tucked this note into the bundle and laid it against the\ndoor behind which Ida and one of her regulars were sleeping\npeacefully.  The odor of Ida's powerful perfume came through\nthe cracks in the door; Susan drew it eagerly into her\nnostrils, sobbed softly, turned away, It was one of the\nperfumes classed as immoral; to Susan it was the aroma of a\nfriendship as noble, as disinterested, as generous, as human\nsympathy had ever breathed upon human woe.  With her few\npersonal possessions in a package she descended the stairs\nunnoticed, went out into the rain.  At the corner of Sixth\nAvenue she paused, looked up and down the street.  It was\nalmost deserted.  Now and then a streetwalker, roused early by\na lover with perhaps a family waiting for him, hurried by,\nlooking piteous in the daylight which showed up false and dyed\nhair, the layers of paint, the sad tawdriness of battered\nfinery from the cheapest bargain troughs.\n\nSusan went slowly up Sixth Avenue.  Two blocks, and she saw a\ngirl enter the side door of a saloon across the way.  She\ncrossed the street, pushed in at the same door, went on to a\nsmall sitting-room with blinds drawn, with round tables, on\nevery table a match stand.  It was one of those places where\nstreetwalkers rest their weary legs between strolls, and sit\nfor company on rainy or snowy nights, and take shy men for\nsociability-breeding drinks and for the preliminary bargaining.\nThe air of the room was strong with stale liquor and tobacco,\nthe lingering aroma of the night's vanished revels.  In the far\ncorner sat the girl she had followed; a glass of raw whiskey\nand another of water stood on the table before her.  Susan\nseated herself near the door and when the swollen-faced, surly\nbartender came, ordered whiskey.  She poured herself a\ndrink--filled the glass to the brim.  She drank it in two\ngulps, set the empty glass down.  She shivered like an animal\nas it is hit in the head with a poleax.  The mechanism of life\nstaggered, hesitated, went on with a sudden leaping\nacceleration of pace.  Susan tapped her glass against the\nmatchstand.  The bartender came.\n\n\"Another,\" said she.\n\nThe man stared at her.  \"The--hell!\" he ejaculated.  \"You must be\nafraid o' catchin' cold.  Or maybe you're looking for the menagerie?\"\n\nSusan laughed and so did the girl in the corner.  \"Won't you\nhave a drink with me?\" asked Susan.\n\n\"That's very kind of you,\" replied the girl, in the manner of\none eager to show that she, too, is a perfect lady in every\nrespect, used to the ways of the best society.  She moved to a\nchair at Susan's table.\n\nShe and Susan inventoried each other.  Susan saw a mere\nchild--hardly eighteen--possibly not seventeen--but much worn\nby drink and irregular living--evidently one of those who rush\ninto the fast woman's life with the idea that it is a career of\ngayety--and do not find out their error until looks and health\nare gone.  Susan drank her second drink in three gulps, several\nminutes apart.  The girl was explaining in a thin, common\nvoice, childish yet cracked, that she had come there seeking a\ncertain lady friend because she had an extra man and needed a\nside partner.\n\n\"Suppose you come with me,\" she suggested.  \"It's good money,\nI think.  Want to get next?\"\n\n\"When I've had another drink,\" said Susan.  Her eyes were\ngorgeously brilliant.  She had felt almost as reckless several\ntimes before; but never had she felt this devil-may-care\neagerness to see what the turn of the next card would bring.\n\"You'll take one?\"\n\n\"Sure.  I feel like the devil.  Been bumming round all night.\nMy lady friend that I had with me--a regular lady friend--she\nwas suddenly took ill.  Appendicitis complicated with d.t.'s\nthe ambulance guy said.  The boys are waiting for me to come\nback, so's we can go on.  They've got some swell rooms in a\nhotel up in Forty-second Street.  Let's get a move on.\"\n\nThe bartender served the third drink and Susan paid for them,\nthe other girl insisting on paying for the one she was having\nwhen Susan came.  Susan's head was whirling.  Her spirits were\nspiraling up and up.  Her pale lips were wreathed in a reckless\nsmile.  She felt courageous for adventure--any adventure.  Her\ncapital had now sunk to three quarters and a five-cent piece.\nThey issued forth, talking without saying anything, laughing\nwithout knowing or caring why.  Life was a joke--a coarse, broad\njoke--but amusing if one drank enough to blunt any refinement of\nsensibility.  And what was sensibility but a kind of snobbishness?\nAnd what more absurd than snobbishness in an outcast?\n\n\"That's good whiskey they had, back there,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Good?  Yes--if you don't care what you say.\"\n\n\"If you don't want to care what you say or do,\" explained Susan.\n\n\"Oh, all booze is good for that,\" said the girl.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nTHEY went through to Broadway and there stood waiting for a\ncar, each under her own umbrella.  \"Holy Gee!\" cried Susan's\nnew acquaintance.  \"Ain't this rain a soaker?\"\n\nIt was coming in sheets, bent and torn and driven horizontally\nby the wind.  The umbrella, sheltering the head somewhat, gave\na wholly false impression of protection.  Both girls were soon\nsopping wet.  But they were more than cheerful about it; the\nwhiskey made them indifferent to external ills as they warmed\nthemselves by its bright fire.  At that time a famous and much\nenvied, admired and respected \"captain of industry,\" having\nlooted the street-car systems, was preparing to loot them over\nagain by the familiar trickery of the receivership and the\nreorganization.  The masses of the people were too ignorant to\nknow what was going on; the classes were too busy, each man of\neach of them, about his own personal schemes for graft of one\nkind and another.  Thus, the street-car service was a joke and\na disgrace.  However, after four or five minutes a north-bound\ncar appeared.\n\n\"But it won't stop,\" cried Susan.  \"It's jammed.\"\n\n\"That's why it will stop,\" replied her new acquaintance.  \"You\ndon't suppose a New York conductor'd miss a chance to put his\npassengers more on the bum than ever?\"\n\nShe was right, at least as to the main point; and the conductor\nwith much free handling of their waists and shoulders added\nthem to the dripping, straining press of passengers, enduring\nthe discomforts the captain of industry put upon them with more\npatience than cattle would have exhibited in like\ncircumstances.  All the way up Broadway the new acquaintance\nenlivened herself and Susan and the men they were squeezed in\namong by her loud gay sallies which her young prettiness made\nseem witty.  And certainly she did have an amazing and amusing\nacquaintance with the slang at the moment current.  The worn\nlook had vanished, her rounded girlhood freshness had returned.\nAs for Susan, you would hardly have recognized her as the same\nperson who had issued from the house in Twenty-ninth Street\nless than an hour before.  Indeed, it was not the same person.\nDrink nervifies every character; here it transformed,\nsuppressing the characteristics that seemed, perhaps were,\nessential in her normal state, and causing to bloom in sudden\naudacity of color and form the passions and gayeties at other\ntimes subdued by her intelligence and her sensitiveness.  Her\nbrilliant glance moved about the car full as boldly as her\ncompanion's.  But there was this difference:  Her companion\ngazed straight into the eyes of the men; Susan's glance shot\npast above or just below their eyes.\n\nAs they left the car at Forty-second Street the other girl gave\nher short skirt a dexterous upward flirt that exhibited her\nlegs almost to the hips.  Susan saw that they were well shaped\nlegs, surprisingly plump from the calves upward, considering\nthe slightness of her figure above the waist.\n\n\"I always do that when I leave a car,\" said the girl.\n\"Sometimes it starts something on the trail.  You forgot your\npackage--back in the saloon!\"\n\n\"Then I didn't forget much,\" laughed Susan.  It appealed to\nher, the idea of entering the new life empty-handed.\n\nThe hotel was one that must have been of the first class in its\nday--not a distant day, for the expansion of New York in\ncraving for showy luxury has been as sudden as the miraculous\nupward thrust of a steel skyscraper.  It had now sunk to\nrelying upon the trade of those who came in off Broadway for a\nfew minutes.  It was dingy and dirty; the walls and plastering\nwere peeling; the servants were slovenly and fresh.  The girl\nnodded to the evil-looking man behind the desk, who said:\n\n\"Hello, Miss Maud.  Just in time.  The boys were sending out\nfor some others.\"\n\n\"They've got a nerve!\" laughed Maud.  And she led Susan down a\nrather long corridor to a door with the letter B upon it.  Maud\nexplained:  \"This is the swellest suite in the house parlor,\nbedroom, bath.\"  She flung open the door, disclosing a\nsitting-room in disorder with two young men partly dressed,\nseated at a small table on which were bottles, siphons,\nmatches, remains of sandwiches, boxes of cigarettes--a chaotic\njumble of implements to dissipation giving forth a powerful,\nstale odor.  Maud burst into a stream of picturesque profanity\nwhich set the two men to laughing.  Susan had paused on the\nthreshold.  The shock of this scene had for the moment arrested the\ntriumphant march of the alcohol through blood and nerve and brain.\n\n\"Oh, bite it off!\" cried the darker of the two men to Maud,\n\"and have a drink.  Ain't you ashamed to speak so free before\nyour innocent young lady friend?\"  He grinned at Susan.  \"What\nSunday school do you hail from?\" inquired he.\n\nThe other young man was also looking at Susan; and it was an\narresting and somewhat compelling gaze.  She saw that he was\ntall and well set up.  As he was dressed only in trousers and\na pale blue silk undershirt, the strength of his shoulders,\nback and arms was in full evidence.  His figure was like that\nof the wonderful young prize-fighters she had admired at moving\npicture shows to which Drumley had taken her.  He had a\nsingularly handsome face, blond yet remotely suggesting\nItalian.  He smiled at Susan and she thought she had never seen\nteeth more beautiful--pearl-white, regular, even.  His eyes\nwere large and sensuous; smiling though they were, Susan was\nill at ease--for in them there shone the same untamed,\nuncontrolled ferocity that one sees in the eyes of a wild\nbeast.  His youth, his good looks, his charm made the sinister\nsavagery hinted in the smile the more disconcerting.  He poured\nwhiskey from a bottle into each of the two tall glasses, filled\nthem up with seltzer, extended one toward Susan.\n\n\"Shut the door, Queenie,\" he said to her in a pleasant tone that\nsubtly mingled mockery and admiration.  \"And let's drink to love.\"\n\n\"Didn't I do well for you, Freddie?\" cried Maud.\n\n\"She's my long-sought affinity,\" declared Freddie with the same\nattractive mingling of jest and flattery.\n\nSusan closed the door, accepted the glass, laughed into his\neyes.  The whiskey was once more asserting its power.  She took\nabout half the drink before she set the glass down.\n\nThe young man said, \"Your name's Queenie, mine's Freddie.\"  He\ncame to her, holding her gaze fast by the piercing look from\nhis handsome eyes.  He put his arms round her and kissed her\nfull upon the pale, laughing lips.  His eyes were still smiling\nin pleasant mockery; yet his kiss burned and stung, and the\ngrip of his arm round her shoulders made her vaguely afraid.\nHer smile died away.  The grave, searching, wondering\nexpression reappeared in the violet-gray eyes for a moment.\n\n\"You're all right,\" said he.  \"Except those pale lips.  You're\ngoing to be my girl.  That means, if you ever try to get away\nfrom me unless I let you go--I'll kill you--or worse.\"  And he\nlaughed as if he had made the best joke in the world.  But she\nsaw in his eyes a sparkle that seemed to her to have something\nof the malignance of the angry serpent's.\n\nShe hastily finished her drink.\n\nMaud was jerking off her clothes, crying, \"I want to get out of\nthese nasty wet rags.\"  The steam heat was full on; the\nsitting-room, the whole suite, was intensely warm.  Maud hung\nher skirt over the back of a chair close to the radiator, took\noff her shoes and stockings and put them to dry also.  In her\nchemise she curled herself on a chair, lit a cigarette and\npoured a drink.  Her feet were not bad, but neither were they\nnotably good; she tucked them out of sight.  She looked at\nSusan.  \"Get off those wet things,\" urged she, \"or you'll take\nyour death.\"\n\n\"In a minute,\" said Susan, but not convincingly.\n\nFreddie forced another drink and a cigarette upon her.  As a\ngirl at home in Sutherland, she had several times--she and\nRuth--smoked cigarettes in secrecy, to try the new London and\nNew York fashion, announced in the newspapers and the novels.\nSo the cigarette did not make her uncomfortable.  \"Look at the\nway she's holding it?\" cried Maud, and she and the men burst\nout laughing.  Susan laughed also and, Freddie helping,\npracticed a less inexpert manner.  Jim, the dark young man with\nthe sullen heavy countenance, rang for more sandwiches and another\nbottle of whiskey.  Susan continued to drink but ate nothing.\n\n\"Have a sandwich,\" said Freddie.\n\n\"I'm not hungry.\"\n\n\"Well, they say that to eat and drink means to die of paresis,\nwhile to only drink means dying of delirium tremens.  I guess\nyou're right.  I'd prefer the d.t.'s.  It's quicker and livelier.\"\n\nJim sang a ribald song with some amusing comedy business.  Maud\ntold several stories whose only claim to point lay in their\nfrankness about things not usually spoken.  \"Don't you tell any\nmore, Maudie,\" advised Freddie.  \"Why is it that a woman never\ntakes up a story until every man on earth has heard it at least\ntwice?\" The sandwiches disappeared, the second bottle of\nwhiskey ran low.  Maud told story after story of how she had\nplayed this man and that for a sucker--was as full of such tales\nand as joyous and self-pleased over them as an honest salesman\ntelling his delighted, respectable, pew-holding employer how he\nhas \"stuck\" this customer and that for a \"fancy\" price.\nPresently Maud again noticed that Susan was in her wet clothes\nand cried out about it.  Susan pretended to start to undress.\nFreddie and Jim suddenly seized her.  She struggled, half\nlaughing; the whiskey was sending into her brain dizzying\nclouds.  She struggled more fiercely.  But it was in vain.\n\n\"Gee, you _have_ got a prize, Freddie!\" exclaimed Jim at last,\nangry.  \"A regular tartar!\"\n\n\"A damn handsome one,\" retorted Freddie.  \"She's even got feet.\"\n\nSusan, amid the laughter of the others, darted for the bedroom.\nCowering in a corner, trying to cover herself, she ordered\nFreddie to leave her.  He laughed, seized her in his iron grip.\nShe struck at him, bit him in the shoulder.  He gave a cry of\npain and drove a savage blow into her cheek.  Then he buried\nhis fingers in her throat and the gleam of his eyes made her\nsoul quail.\n\n\"Don't kill me!\" she cried, in the clutch of cowardice for the\nfirst time.  It was not death that she feared but the phantom\nof things worse than death that can be conjured to the\nimagination by the fury of a personality which is utterly\nreckless and utterly cruel.  \"Don't kill me!\" she shrieked.\n\"What the hell are you doing?\" shouted Jim from the other room.\n\n\"Shut that door,\" replied Freddie.  \"I'm going to attend to my\nlady friend.\"\n\nAs the door slammed, he dragged Susan by the throat and one arm\nto the bed, flung her down.  \"I saw you were a high stepper the\nminute I looked at you,\" said he, in a pleasant, cooing voice\nthat sent the chills up and down her spine.  \"I knew you'd have\nto be broke.  Well, the sooner it's done, the sooner we'll get\nalong nicely.\"  His blue eyes were laughing into hers.  With\nthe utmost deliberation he gripped her throat with one hand and\nwith the other began to slap her, each blow at his full\nstrength.  Her attempts to scream were only gasps.  Quickly the\nagony of his brutality drove her into unconsciousness.  Long\nafter she had ceased to feel pain, she continued to feel the\nimpact of those blows, and dully heard her own deep groans.\n\nWhen she came to her senses, she was lying sprawled upon the\nfar side of the bed.  Her head was aching wildly; her body was\nstiff and sore; her face felt as if it were swollen to many\ntimes its normal size.  In misery she dragged herself up and\nstood on the floor.  She went to the bureau and stared at\nherself in the glass.  Her face was indeed swollen, but not to\nactual disfigurement.  Under her left eye there was a small cut\nfrom which the blood had oozed to smear and dry upon her left\ncheek.  Upon her throat were faint bluish finger marks.  The\ndamage was not nearly so great as her throbbing nerves\nreported--the damage to her body.  But--her soul--it was a\ncrushed, trampled, degraded thing, lying prone and bleeding to\ndeath.  \"Shall I kill myself?\" she thought.  And the answer\ncame in a fierce protest and refusal from every nerve of her\nintensely vital youth.  She looked straight into her own\neyes--without horror, without shame, without fear.  \"You are as\nlow as the lowest,\" she said to her image--not to herself but\nto her image; for herself seemed spectator merely of that body\nand soul aching and bleeding and degraded.\n\nIt was the beginning of self-consciousness with her--a curious\nkind of self-consciousness--her real self, aloof and far\nremoved, observing calmly, critically, impersonally the\nadventures of her body and the rest of her surface self.\n\nShe turned round to look again at the man who had outraged\nthem.  His eyes were open and he was gazing dreamily at her, as\nsmiling and innocent as a child.  When their eyes met, his\nsmile broadened until he was showing his beautiful teeth.  \"You\n_are_ a beauty!\" said he.  \"Go into the other room and get me a\ncigarette.\"\n\nShe continued to look fixedly at him.\n\nWithout change of expression he said gently, \"Do you want\nanother lesson in manners?\"\n\nShe went to the door, opened it, entered the sitting-room.  The\nother two had pulled open a folding bed and were lying in it,\nJim's head on Maud's bosom, her arms round his neck.  Both were\nasleep.  His black beard had grown out enough to give his face\na dirty and devilish expression.  Maud looked far more youthful\nand much prettier than when she was awake.  Susan put a\ncigarette between her lips, lit it, carried a box of cigarettes\nand a stand of matches in to Freddie.\n\n\"Light one for me,\" said he.\n\nShe obeyed, held it to his lips.\n\n\"Kiss me, first.\"\n\nHer pale lips compressed.\n\n\"Kiss me,\" he repeated, far down in his eyes the vicious gleam\nof that boundlessly ferocious cruelty which is mothered not by\nrage but by pleasure.\n\nShe kissed him on the cheek.\n\n\"On the lips,\" he commanded.\n\nTheir lips met, and it was to her as if a hot flame, terrible\nyet thrilling, swept round and embraced her whole body.\n\n\"Do you love me?\" he asked tenderly.\n\nShe was silent.\n\n\"You love me?\" he asked commandingly.\n\n\"You can call it that if you like.\"\n\n\"I knew you would.  I understand women.  The way to make a\nwoman love is to make her afraid.\"\n\nShe gazed at him.  \"I am not afraid,\" she said.\n\nHe laughed.  \"Oh, yes.  That's why you do what I say--and\nalways will.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied she.  \"I don't do it because I am afraid, but\nbecause I want to live.\"\n\n\"I should think! . . .  You'll be all right in a day or so,\"\nsaid he, after inspecting her bruises.  \"Now, I'll explain to\nyou what good friends we're going to be.\"\n\nHe propped himself in an attitude of lazy grace, puffed at his\ncigarette in silence for a moment, as if arranging what he had\nto say.  At last he began:\n\n\"I haven't any regular business.  I wasn't born to work.  Only\ndamn fools work--and the clever man waits till they've got\nsomething, then he takes it away from 'em.  You don't want to\nwork, either.\"\n\n\"I haven't been able to make a living at it,\" said the girl.\nShe was sitting cross-legged, a cover draped around her.\n\n\"You're too pretty and too clever.  Besides, as you say, you\ncouldn't make a living at it--not what's a living for a woman\nbrought up as you've been.  No, you can't work.  So we're going\nto be partners.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan.  \"I'm going to dress now and go away.\"\n\nFreddie laughed.  \"Don't be a fool.  Didn't I say we were to be\npartners? . . .  You want to keep on at the sporting business,\ndon't you?\"\n\nHers was the silence of assent.\n\n\"Well--a woman--especially a young one like you--is no good unless\nshe has someone--some man--behind her.  Married or single,\nrespectable or lively, working or sporting--N. G. without a\nman.  A woman alone doesn't amount to any more than a rich\nman's son.\"\n\nThere had been nothing in Susan's experience to enable her to\ndispute this.\n\n\"Now, I'm going to stand behind you.  I'll see that you don't\nget pinched, and get you out if you do.  I'll see that you get\nthe best the city's got if you're sick--and so on.  I've got a\npull with the organization.  I'm one of Finnegan's lieutenants.\nSome day--when I'm older and have served my apprenticeship--I'll\npull off something good.  Meanwhile--I manage to live.  I always\nhave managed it--and I never did a stroke of real work since I\nwas a kid--and never shall.  God was mighty good to me when he\nput a few brains in this nut of mine.\"\n\nHe settled his head comfortably in the pillow and smiled at his\nown thoughts.  In spite of herself Susan had been not only\ninterested but attracted.  It is impossible for any human being\nto contemplate mystery in any form without being fascinated.\nAnd here was the profoundest mystery she had ever seen.  He\ntalked well, and his mode of talking was that of education, of\nrefinement even.  An extraordinary man, certainly--and in what\na strange way!\n\n\"Yes,\" said he presently, looking at her with his gentle,\nfriendly smile.  \"We'll be partners.  I'll protect you and\nwe'll divide what you make.\"\n\nWhat a strange creature!  Had he--this kindly handsome\nyouth--done that frightful thing?  No--no.  It was another\ninstance of the unreality of the outward life.  _He_ had not\ndone it, any more than she--her real self--had suffered it.  Her\nreply to his restatement of the partnership was:\n\n\"No, thank you.  I want nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\"You're dead slow,\" said he, with mild and patient persuasion.\n\"How would you get along at your business in this town if you\ndidn't have a backer?  Why, you'd be taking turns at the Island\nand the gutter within six months.  You'd be giving all your\nmoney to some rotten cop or fly cop who couldn't protect you,\nat that.  Or you'd work the street for some cheap cadet who'd\nbeat you up oftener than he'd beat up the men who welched on you.\"\n\n\"I'll look out for myself,\" persisted she.\n\n\"Bless the baby!\" exclaimed he, immensely amused.  \"How lucky\nthat you found me!  I'm going to take care of you in spite of\nyourself.  Not for nothing, of course.  You wouldn't value me\nif you got me for nothing.  I'm going to help you, and you're\ngoing to help me.  You need me, and I need you.  Why do you\nsuppose I took the trouble to tame you?  What _you_ want doesn't\ngo.  It's what _I_ want.\"\n\nHe let her reflect on this a while.  Then he went on:\n\n\"You don't understand about fellows like Jim and me--though\nJim's a small potato beside me, as you'll soon find out.\nSuppose you didn't obey orders--just as I do what Finnegan\ntells me--just as Finnegan does what the big shout down below\nsays?  Suppose you didn't obey--what then?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" confessed Susan.\n\n\"Well, it's time you learned.  We'll say, you act stubborn.\nYou dress and say good-by to me and start out.  Do you think\nI'm wicked enough to let you make a fool of yourself?  Well,\nI'm not.  You won't get outside the door before your good angel\nhere will get busy.  I'll be telephoning to a fly cop of this\ndistrict.  And what'll he do?  Why, about the time you are\nhalfway down the block, he'll pinch you.  He'll take you to the\nstation house.  And in Police Court tomorrow the Judge'll give\nyou a week on the Island for being a streetwalker.\"\n\nSusan shivered.  She instinctively glanced toward the window.\nThe rain was still falling, changing the City of the Sun into\na city of desolation.  It looked as though it would never see\nthe sun again--and her life looked that way, also.\n\nFreddie was smiling pleasantly.  He went on:\n\n\"You do your little stretch on the Island.  When your time's up\nI send you word where to report to me.  We'll say you don't\ncome.  The minute you set foot on the streets again alone, back\nto the Island you go.  .  .  .  Now, do you understand,\nQueenie?\"  And he laughed and pulled her over and kissed her and\nsmoothed her hair.  \"You're a very superior article--you are,\"\nhe murmured.  \"I'm stuck on you.\"\n\nSusan did not resist.  She did not care what happened to her.\nThe more intelligent a trapped animal is, the less resistance\nit offers, once it realizes.  Helpless--absolutely helpless.\nNo money--no friends.  No escape but death.  The sun was\nshining.  Outside lay the vast world; across the street on a\nflagpole fluttered the banner of freedom.  Freedom!  Was there\nany such thing anywhere?  Perhaps if one had plenty of\nmoney--or powerful friends.  But not for her, any more than for\nthe masses whose fate of squalid and stupid slavery she was\ntrying to escape.  Not for her; so long as she was helpless she\nwould simply move from one land of slavery to another.  Helpless!\nTo struggle would not be courageous, but merely absurd.\n\n\"If you don't believe me, ask Maud,\" said Freddie.  \"I don't\nwant you to get into trouble.  As I told you, I'm stuck on\nyou.\"  With his cigarette gracefully loose between those almost\ntoo beautifully formed lips of his and with one of his strong\nsmooth white arms about his head, he looked at her, an\nexpression of content with himself, of admiration for her in\nhis handsome eyes.  \"You don't realize your good luck.  But\nyou will when you find how many girls are crazy to get on the\ngood side of me.  This is a great old town, and nobody amounts\nto anything in it unless he's got a pull or is next to somebody\nelse that has.\"\n\nSusan's slow reflective nod showed that this statement\nexplained, or seemed to explain, certain mysteries of life that\nhad been puzzling her.\n\n\"You've got a lot in you,\" continued he.  \"That's my opinion,\nand I'm a fair judge of yearlings.  You're liable to land\nsomewhere some day when you've struck your gait.  .  .  .  If\nI had the mon I'd be tempted to set you up in a flat and keep\nyou all to myself.  But I can't afford it.  It takes a lot of\ncash to keep me going.  .  .  .  You'll do well.  You won't\nhave to bother with any but classy gents.  I'll see that the\ncops put you wise when there's anyone round throwing his money\naway.  And I can help you, myself.  I've got quite a line of\nfriends among the rich chappies from Fifth Avenue.  And I\nalways let my girls get the benefit of it.\"\n\nMy girls!  Susan's mind, recovering now from its daze, seized\nupon this phrase.  And soon she had fathomed how these two\nyoung men came to be so luxuriously dressed, so well supplied\nwith money.  She had heard of this system under which the girls\nin the streets were exploited as thoroughly as the girls in the\nhouses.  In all the earth was there anyone who was suffered to\ndo for himself or herself without there being a powerful idle\nsomeone else to take away all the proceeds but a bare living?\nHelpless!  Helpless!\n\n\"How many girls have you?\" she asked.\n\n\"Jealous already!\" And he laughed and blew a cloud of smoke\ninto her face.\n\n\nShe took the quarters he directed--a plain clean room two\nflights up at seven dollars a week, in a furnished room house\non West Forty-third Street near Eighth Avenue.  She was but a\nfew blocks from where she and Rod had lived.  New York--to a\ndegree unrivaled among the cities of the world--illustrates in\nthe isolated lives of its never isolated inhabitants how little\nrelationship there is between space and actualities of\ndistance.  Wherever on earth there are as many as two human\nbeings, one may see an instance of the truth.  That an infinity\nof spiritual solitude can stretch uncrossable even between two\nlocked in each other's loving arms!  But New York's solitudes,\nits separations, extend to the surface things.  Susan had no\nsense of the apparent nearness of her former abode.  Her life\nagain lay in the same streets; but there again came the sense\nof strangeness which only one who has lived in New York could\nappreciate.  The streets were the same; but to her they seemed\nas the streets of another city, because she was now seeing in\nthem none of the things she used to see, was seeing instead\nkinds of people, aspects of human beings, modes of feeling and\nacting and existing of which she used to have not the faintest\nknowledge.  There were as many worlds as kinds of people.\nThus, though we all talk to each other as if about the same\nworld, each of us is thinking of his own kind of world, the\nonly one he sees.  And that is why there can never be sympathy\nand understanding among the children of men until there is some\napproach to resemblance in their various lots; for the lot\ndetermines the man.\n\nThe house was filled with women of her own kind.  They were\nallowed all privileges.  There was neither bath nor stationary\nwashstand, but the landlady supplied tin tubs on request.  \"Oh,\nMr. Palmer's recommendation,\" said she; \"I'll give you two days\nto pay.  My terms are in advance.  But Mr. Palmer's a dear\nfriend of mine.\"\n\nShe was a short woman with a monstrous bust and almost no hips.\nHer thin hair was dyed and frizzled, and her voice sounded as\nif it found its way out of her fat lips after a long struggle\nto pass through the fat of her throat and chest.  Her second\nchin lay upon her bosom in a soft swollen bag that seemed to be\nsuspended from her ears.  Her eyes were hard and evil, of a\nbrownish gray.  She affected suavity and elaborate politeness;\nbut if the least thing disturbed her, she became red and coarse\nof voice and vile of language.  The vile language and the\nnature of her business and her private life aside, she would\nhave compared favorably with anyone in the class of those who\ndeal--as merchants, as landlords, as boarding-house\nkeepers--with the desperately different classes of uncertain\nincome.  She was reputed rich.  They said she stayed on in\nbusiness to avoid lonesomeness and to keep in touch with all\nthat was going on in the life that had been hers from girlhood.\n\n\"And she's a mixer,\" said Maud to Susan.  In response to\nSusan's look of inquiry, she went on to explain, \"A mixer's a\nwhite woman that keeps a colored man.\"  Maud laughed at Susan's\nexpression of horror.  \"You are a greenie,\" she mocked.  \"Why,\nit's all the rage.  Nearly all the girls do--from the\nheadliners that are kept by the young Fifth Avenue millionaires\ndown to nine out of ten of the girls of our set that you see in\nBroadway.  No, I'm not lying.  It's the truth.  _I_ don't do\nit--at least, not yet.  I may get round to it.\"\n\nAfter the talk with Maud about the realities of life as it is\nlived by several hundred thousand of the inhabitants of\nManhattan Island Susan had not the least disposition to test by\ndefiance the truth of Freddie Palmer's plain statement as to\nhis powers and her duties.  He had told her to go to work that\nvery Sunday evening, and Jim had ordered Maud to call for her\nand to initiate her.  And at half-past seven Maud came.  At\nonce she inspected Susan's swollen face.\n\n\"Might be a bit worse,\" she said.  \"With a veil on, no one'd\nnotice it.\"\n\n\"But I haven't a veil,\" said Susan.\n\n\"I've got mine with me--pinned to my garter.  I haven't been\nhome since this afternoon.\"  And Maud produced it.\n\n\"But I can't wear a veil at night,\" objected Susan.\n\n\"Why not?\" said Maud.  \"Lots of the girls do.  A veil's a dandy\nhider.  Besides, even where a girl's got nothing to hide and\nhas a face that's all to the good, still it's not a bad idea to\nwear a veil.  Men like what they can't see.  One of the ugliest\ngirls I know makes a lot of money--all with her veil.  She\nfixes up her figure something grand.  Then she puts on that\nveil--one of the kind you think you can see a face through but\nyou really can't.  And she never lifts it till the 'come on'\nhas given up his cash.  Then----\" Maud laughed.  \"Gee, but she\nhas had some hot run-ins after she hoists her curtain!\"\n\n\"Why don't you wear a veil all the time?\" asked Susan.\n\nMaud tossed her head.  \"What do you take me for?  I've got too\ngood an opinion of my looks for that.\"\n\nSusan put on the veil.  It was not of the kind that is a\ndisguise.  Still, diaphanous though it seemed, it concealed\nastonishingly the swelling in Susan's face.  Obviously, then,\nit must at least haze the features, would do something toward\nblurring the marks that go to make identity.\n\n\"I shall always wear a veil,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" deprecated Maud.  \"I think you're quite\npretty--though a little too proper and serious looking to suit\nsome tastes.\"\n\nSusan had removed veil and hat, was letting down her hair.\n\n\"What are you doing that for?\" cried Maud impatiently.  \"We're\nlate now and----\"\n\n\"I don't like the way my hair's done,\" cried Susan.\n\n\"Why, it was all right--real swell--good as a hairdresser could\nhave done.\"\n\nBut Susan went on at her task.  Ever since she came East she\nhad worn it in a braid looped at the back of her head.  She\nproceeded to change this radically.  With Maud forgetting to be\nimpatient in admiration of her swift fingers she made a\ncoiffure much more elaborate--wide waves out from her temples\nand a big round loose knot behind.  She was well content with\nthe result--especially when she got the veil on again and it\nwas assisting in the change.\n\n\"What do you think?\" she said to Maud when she was ready.\n\n\"My, but you look different!\" exclaimed Maud.  \"A lot\ndressier--and sportier.  More--more Broadway.\"\n\n\"That's it--Broadway,\" said Susan.  She had always avoided\nlooking like Broadway.  Now, she would take the opposite tack.\nNot loud toilets--for they would defeat her purpose.  Not loud\nbut--just common.\n\n\"But,\" added Maud, \"you do look swell about the feet.  Where\n_do_ you get your shoes?  No, I guess it's the feet.\"\n\nAs they sallied forth Maud said, \"First, I'll show you our\nhotel.\"  And they went to a Raines Law hotel in Forty-second\nStreet near Eighth Avenue.  \"The proprietor's a heeler of\nFinnegan's.  I guess Freddie comes in for some rake-off.  He\ngives us twenty-five cents of every dollar the man spends,\"\nexplained she.  \"And if the man opens wine we get two dollars\non every bottle.  The best way is to stay behind when the man\ngoes and collect right away.  That avoids rows--though they'd\nhardly dare cheat you, being as you're on Freddie's staff.\nFreddie's got a big pull.  He's way up at the top.  I wish to\nGod I had him instead of Jim.  Freddie's giving up fast.  They\nsay he's got some things a lot better'n this now, and that he's\nlikely to quit this and turn respectable.  You ought to treat\nme mighty white, seeing what I done for you.  I've put you in\nright--and that's everything in this here life.\"\n\nSusan looked all round--looked along the streets stretching\naway with their morning suggestion of freedom to fly, freedom\nto escape--helpless!  \"Can't I get a drink?\" asked she.  There\nwas a strained look in her eyes, a significant nervousness of\nthe lips and hands.  \"I must have a drink.\"\n\n\"Of course.  Max has been on a vacation, but I hear he's back.\nWhen I introduce you, he'll probably set 'em up.  But I\nwouldn't drink if I were you till I went off duty.\"\n\n\"I must have a drink,\" replied Susan.\n\n\"It'll get you down.  It got me down.  I used to have a fine\nsucker--gave me a hundred a week and paid my flat rent.  But I\nhad nothing else to do, so I took to drinking, and I got so\nreckless that I let him catch me with my lover that time.  But\nI had to have somebody to spend the money on.  Anyhow, it's no\nfun having a John.\"\n\n\"A John?\" said Susan.  \"What's that?\"\n\n\"You are an innocent----!\" laughed Maud.  \"A John's a sucker--a\nfellow that keeps a girl.  Well, it'd be no fun to have a John\nunless you fooled him--would it?\"\n\nThey now entered the side door of the hotel and ascended the\nstairs.  A dyspeptic looking man with a red nose that stood out\nthe more strongly for the sallowness of his skin and the\nsmallness of his sunken brown eyes had his hands spread upon\nthe office desk and was leaning on his stiff arms.  \"Hello,\nMax,\" said Maud in a fresh, condescending way.  \"How's business?\"\n\n\"Slow.  Always slack on Sundays.  How goes it with you, Maudie?\"\n\n\"So--so.  I manage to pick up a living in spite of the damn\nchippies.  I don't see why the hell they don't go into the\nbusiness regular and make something out of it, instead of\nloving free.  I'm down on a girl that's neither the one thing\nnor the other.  This is my lady friend, Miss Queenie.\"  She\nturned laughingly to Susan.  \"I never asked your last name.\"\n\n\"Brown.\"\n\n\"My, what a strange name!\" cried Maud.  Then, as the proprietor\nlaughed with the heartiness of tradesman at good customer's\njest, she said, \"Going to set 'em up, Max?\"\n\nHe pressed a button and rang a bell loudly.  The responding\nwaiter departed with orders for a whiskey and two lithias.\nMaud explained to Susan:\n\n\"Max used to be a prize-fighter.  He was middleweight champion.\"\n\n\"I've been a lot of things in my days,\" said Max with pride.\n\n\"So I've heard,\" joked Maud.  \"They say they've got your\npicture at headquarters.\"\n\n\"That's neither here nor there,\" said Max surlily.  \"Don't get\ntoo flip.\"  Susan drank her whiskey as soon as it came, and the\nglow rushed to her ghastly face.  Said Max with great politeness:\n\n\"You're having a little neuralgia, ain't you?  I see your face\nis swhole some.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan.  \"Neuralgia.\"  Maud laughed hilariously.\nSusan herself had ceased to brood over the incident.  In\nconventional lives, visited but rarely by perilous storms, by\ndisaster, such an event would be what is called concise.  But\nin life as it is lived by the masses of the people--life in\nwhich awful disease, death, maiming, eviction, fire, violent\nevent of any and every kind, is part of the daily routine in\nthat life of the masses there is no time for lingering upon the\nweathered storm or for bothering about and repairing its\nravages.  Those who live the comparatively languid, the\nsheltered life should not use their own standards of what is\ndelicate and refined, what is conspicuous and strong, when they\njudge their fellow beings as differently situated.\nNevertheless, they do--with the result that we find the puny mud\nlark criticizing the eagle battling with the hurricane.\n\nWhen Susan and Maud were in the street again, Susan declared\nthat she must have another drink.  \"I can't offer to pay for\none for you,\" said she to Maud.  \"I've almost no money.  And I\nmust spend what I've got for whiskey before I--can--can--start in.\"\n\nMaud began to laugh, looked at Susan, and was almost crying\ninstead.  \"I can lend you a fiver,\" she said.  \"Life's\nhell--ain't it?  My father used to have a good\nbusiness--tobacco.  The trust took it away from him--and then\nhe drank--and mother, she drank, too.  And one day he beat her\nso she died--and he ran away.  Oh, it's all awful!  But I've\nstopped caring.  I'm stuck on Jim--and another little fellow he\ndon't know about.  For God's sake don't tell him or he'd have\nme pinched for doing business free.  I get full every night and\nraise old Nick.  Sometimes I hate Jim.  I've tried to kill him\ntwice when I was loaded.  But a girl's got to have a backer\nwith a pull.  And Jim lets me keep a bigger share of what I\nmake than some fellows.  Freddie's pretty good too, they\nsay--except when he's losing on the races or gets stuck on some\nactress that's too classy to be shanghaied--like you was--and\nthat makes him cough up.\"\n\nMaud went on to disclose that Jim usually let her have all she\nmade above thirty dollars a week, and in hard weeks had\nsometimes let her beg off with fifteen.  Said she:\n\n\"I can generally count on about fifteen or twenty for myself.\nUs girls that has backers make a lot more money than the girls\nthat hasn't.  They're always getting pinched too--though\nthey're careful never to speak first to a man.  _We_ can go\nright up and brace men with the cops looking on.  A cop that'd\ntouch us would get broke--unless we got too gay or robbed\nsomebody with a pull.  But none of our class of girls do any\nrobbing.  There's nothing in it.  You get caught sooner or\nlater, and then you're down and out.\"\n\nWhile Susan was having two more drinks Maud talked about\nFreddie.  She seemed to know little about him, though he was\nevidently one of the conspicuous figures.  He had started in\nthe lower East Side--had been leader of one of those gangs that\ninfest tenement districts--the young men who refuse to submit\nto the common lot of stupid and badly paid toil and try to\nfight their way out by the quick methods of violence instead of\nthe slower but surer methods of robbing the poor through a\nstore of some kind.  These gangs were thieves, blackmailers,\nkidnapers of young girls for houses of prostitution, repeaters.\nMost of them graduated into habitual jailbirds, a few--the\ncleverest--became saloon-keepers and politicians and high-class\nprofessional gamblers and race track men.\n\nFreddie, Maud explained, was not much over twenty-five, yet was\nalready well up toward the place where successful gang leaders\ncrossed over into the respectable class--that is, grafted in\n\"big figures.\"  He was a great reader, said Maud, and had taken\ncourses at some college.  \"They say he and his gang used to\nkill somebody nearly every night.  Then he got a lot of money\nout of one of his jobs--some say it was a bank robbery and some\nsay they killed a miner who was drunk with a big roll on him.\nAnyhow, Freddie got next to Finnegan--he's worth several\nmillions that he made out of policy shops and poolrooms, and\ncontracts and such political things.  So he's in right--and he's\ngot the brains.  He's a good one for working out schemes for\nmaking people work hard and bring him their money.  And\neverybody's afraid of him because he won't stop at nothing and\nis too slick to get caught.\"\n\nMaud broke off abruptly and rose, warned by the glazed look in\nSusan's eyes.  Susan was so far gone that she had difficulty in\nnot staggering and did not dare speak lest her uncertain tongue\nshould betray her.  Maud walked her up and down the block\nseveral times to give the fresh air a chance, then led her up\nto a man who had looked at them in passing and had paused to\nlook back.  \"Want to go have a good time, sweetheart?\" said\nMaud to the man.  He was well dressed, middle-aged, with a full\nbeard and spectacles, looked as if he might be a banker, or\nperhaps a professor in some college.\n\n\"How much?\" asked he.\n\n\"Five for a little while.  Come along, sporty.  Take me or my\nlady friend.\"\n\n\"How much for both of you?\"\n\n\"Ten.  We don't cut rates.  Take us both, dearie.  I know a\nhotel where it'd be all right.\"\n\n\"No.  I guess I'll take your lady friend.\"  He had been peering\nat Susan through his glasses.  \"And if she treats me well, I'll\ntake her again.  You're sure you're all right?  I'm a married man.\"\n\n\"We've both been home visiting for a month, and walking the\nchalk.  My, but ma's strict!  We got back tonight,\" said Maud\nglibly.  \"Go ahead, Queenie.  I'll be chasing up and down here,\nwaiting.\"  In a lower tone:  \"Get through with him quick.  Strike\nhim for five more after you get the first five.  He's a blob.\"\n\nWhen Susan came slinking through the office of the hotel in the\nwake of the man two hours later, Maud sprang from the little\nparlor.  \"How much did you get?\" she asked in an undertone.\n\nSusan looked nervously at the back of the man who was descending\nthe stairway to the street.  \"He said he'd pay me next time,\"\nshe said.  \"I didn't know what to do.  He was polite and----\"\n\nMaud seized her by the arm.  \"Come along!\" she cried.  As she\npassed the desk she said to the clerk, \"A dirty bilker!  Tryin'\nto kiss his way out!\"\n\n\"Give him hell,\" said the clerk.\n\nMaud, still gripping Susan, overtook the man at the sidewalk.\n\"What do you mean by not paying my lady friend?\" she shouted.\n\n\"Get out!\" said the man in a low tone, with an uneasy glance\nround.  \"If you annoy me I'll call the police.\"\n\n\"If you don't cough up mighty damn quick,\" cried Maud so loudly\nthat several passers-by stopped, \"I'll do the calling myself,\nyou bum, and have you pinched for insulting two respectable\nworking girls.\"  And she planted herself squarely before him.\nSusan drew back into the shadow of the wall.\n\nUp stepped Max, who happened to be standing outside his place.\n\"What's the row about?\" he demanded.\n\n\"These women are trying to blackmail me,\" said the man, sidling away.\n\nMaud seized him by the arm.  \"Will you cough up or shall I\nscream?\" she cried.\n\n\"Stand out of the way, girls,\" said Max savagely, \"and let me\ntake a crack at the----.\"\n\nThe man dived into his pocket, produced a bill, thrust it\ntoward Susan.  Maud saw that it was a five.  \"That's only\nfive,\" she cried.  \"Where's the other five?\"\n\n\"Five was the bargain,\" whined the man.\n\n\"Do you want me to push in your blinkers, you damned old bilk,\nyou?\" cried Max, seizing him violently by the arm.  The man\nvisited his pocket again, found another five, extended the two.\nMaud seized them.  \"Now, clear out!\" said Max.  \"I hate to let\nyou go without a swift kick in the pants.\"\n\nMaud pressed the money on Susan and thanked Max.  Said Max,\n\"Don't forget to tell Freddie what I done for his girl.\"\n\n\"She'll tell him, all right,\" Maud assured him.\n\nAs the girls went east through Forty-second Street, Susan said,\n\"I'm afraid that man'll lay for us.\"\n\n\"Lay for us,\" laughed Maud.  \"He'll run like a cat afire if he\never sights us again.\"\n\n\"I feel queer and faint,\" said Susan.  \"I must have a drink.\"\n\n\"Well--I'll go with you.  But I've got to get busy.  I want a\ncouple of days off this week for my little fellow, so I must\nhustle.  You let that dirty dog keep you too long.  Half an\nhour's plenty enough.  Always make 'em cough up in advance,\nthen hustle 'em through.  And don't listen to their guff about\nwanting to see you again if you treat 'em right.  There's\nnothing in it.\"\n\nThey went into a restaurant bar near Broadway.  Susan took two\ndrinks of whiskey raw in rapid succession; Maud took one\ndrink--a green mint with ice.  \"While you was fooling away time\nwith that thief,\" said she, \"I had two men--got five from one,\nthree from the other.  The five-dollar man took a three-dollar\nroom--that was seventy-five for me.  The three-dollar man\nwouldn't stand for more than a dollar room--so I got only a\nquarter there.  But he set 'em up to two rounds of drinks--a\nquarter more for me.  So I cleared nine twenty-five.  And you'd\n'a' got only your twenty-five cents commission on the room if\nit hadn't been for me.  You forgot to collect your commission.\nWell, you can get it next time.  Only I wouldn't _ask_ for it,\nMax was so nice in helping out.  He'll give you the quarter.\"\n\nWhen Susan had taken her second stiff drink, her eyes were\nsparkling and she was laughing recklessly.  \"I want a\ncigarette,\" she said.\n\n\"You feel bully, don't you?\"\n\n\"I'm ready for anything,\" declared she giddily.  \"I don't give\na damn.  I'm over the line.  I--_don't_--give--a--damn!\"\n\n\"I used to hate the men I went up with,\" said Maud, \"but now\nI hardly look at their faces.  You'll soon be that way.  Then\nyou'll only drink for fun.  Drink--and dope--they are about the\nonly fun we have--them and caring about some fellow.\"\n\n\"How many girls has Freddie got?\"\n\n\"Search me.  Not many that he'd speak to himself.  Jim's his\nwardman--does his collecting for him.  Freddie's above most of\nthe men in this business.  The others are about like Jim--tough\nstraight through, but Freddie's a kind of a pullman.  The other\nmen-even Jim--hate him for being such a snare and being able to\nhide it that he's in such a low business.  They'd have done him\nup long ago, if they could.  But he's to wise for them.  That's\nwhy they have to do what he says.  I tell you, you're in\nright, for sure.  You'll have Freddie eating out of your hand,\nif you play a cool hand.\"\n\nSusan ordered another drink and a package of Egyptian\ncigarettes.  \"They don't allow ladies to smoke in here,\" said\nMaud.  \"We'll go to the washroom.\"\n\nAnd in the washroom they took a few hasty puffs before sallying\nforth again.  Usually Sunday night was dull, all the men having\nspent their spare money the night before, and it being a bad\nnight for married men to make excuses for getting away from\nhome.  Maud explained that, except \"out-of-towners,\" the\nmarried men were the chief support of their profession--\"and\nmost of the cornhuskers are married men, too.\"  But Susan had\nthe novice's luck.  When she and Maud met Maud's \"little\ngentleman friend\" Harry Tucker at midnight and went to\nConsidine's for supper, Susan had taken in \"presents\" and\ncommissions twenty-nine dollars and a half.  Maud had not done\nso badly, herself; her net receipts were twenty-two fifty.\n\nShe would not let Susan pay any part of the supper bill, but\ngave Harry the necessary money.  \"Here's a five,\" said she,\npressing the bill into his hand, \"and keep the change.\"\n\nAnd she looked at him with loving eyes of longing.  He was a\npretty, common-looking fellow, a mere boy, who clerked in a\nhaberdashery in the neighborhood.  As he got only six dollars\na week and had to give five to his mother who sewed, he could\nnot afford to spend money on Maud, and she neither expected nor\nwished it.  When she picked him up, he like most of his\nfellow-clerks had no decent clothing but the suit he had to\nhave to \"make a front\" at the store.  Maud had outfitted him\nfrom the skin with the cheap but showy stuff exhibited for just\nsuch purposes in the Broadway windows.  She explained\nconfidentially to Susan:\n\n\"It makes me sort of feel that I own him.  Then, too, in love\nthere oughtn't to be any money.  If he paid, I'd be as cold to\nhim as I am to the rest.  The only reason I like Jim at all is\nI like a good beating once in a while.  It's exciting.  Jim--he\ntreats me like the dirt under his feet.  And that's what we\nare--dirt under the men's feet.  Every woman knows it, when it\ncomes to a showdown between her and a man.  As my pop used to\nsay, the world was made for men, not for women.  Still, our\ngraft ain't so bum, at that--if we work it right.\"\n\nFreddie called on Susan about noon the next day.  She was still\nin bed.  He was dressed in the extreme of fashion, was wearing\na chinchilla-lined coat.  He looked the idle, sportively\ninclined son of some rich man in the Fifth Avenue district.  He\nwas having an affair with a much admired young actress--was\nengaged in it rather as a matter of vanity and for the\nfashionable half-world associations into which it introduced\nhim rather than from any present interest in the lady.  He\nstood watching Susan with a peculiar expression--one he might\nperhaps have found it hard to define himself.  He bent over her\nand carelessly brushed her ear with his lips.  \"How did your\nroyal highness make out?\" inquired he.\n\n\"The money's in the top bureau drawer,\" replied she, the covers\nup to her eyes and her eyes closed.\n\nHe went to the bureau, opened the drawer, with his gloved hands\ncounted the money.  As he counted his eyes had a look in them\nthat was strangely like jealous rage.  He kept his back toward\nher for some time after he had crossed to look at the money.\nWhen he spoke it was to say:\n\n\"Not bad.  And when you get dressed up a bit and lose your\nstage fright, you'll do a smashing business.  I'll not take my\nshare of this.  I had a good run with the cards last night.\nAnyhow, you've got to pay your rent and buy some clothes.  I've\ngot to invest something in my new property.  It's badly run\ndown.  You'll get busy again tonight, of course.  Never lay\noff, lady, unless the weather's bad.  You'll find you won't\naverage more than twenty good business days a month in summer\nand fall, and only about ten in winter and spring, when it's\ncold and often lots of bad weather in the afternoons and\nevenings.  That means hustle.\"\n\nNo sign from Susan.  He sat on the bed and pulled the covers\naway from her face.  \"What are you so grouchy about, pet?\" he\ninquired, chucking her under the chin.\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Too much booze, I'll bet.  Well, sleep your grouch off.  I've\ngot a date with Finnegan.  The election's coming on, and I have\nto work--lining up the vote and getting the repeaters ready.\nIt all means good money for me.  Look out about the booze,\nlady.  It'll float you into trouble--trouble with me, I mean.\"\nAnd he patted her bare shoulders, laughed gently, went to the door.\nHe paused there, struggled with an impulse to turn--departed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nBUT she did not \"look out about the booze.\"  Each morning she\nawoke in a state of depression so horrible that she wondered\nwhy she could not bring herself to plan suicide.  Why was it?\nHer marriage?  Yes--and she paid it its customary tribute of a\nshudder.  Yes, her marriage had made all things thereafter\npossible.  But what else?  Lack of courage?  Lack of\nself-respect?  Was it not always assumed that a woman in her\nposition, if she had a grain of decent instinct, would rush\neagerly upon death?  Was she so much worse than others?  Or was\nwhat everybody said about these things--everybody who had\nexperience--was it false, like nearly everything else she had\nbeen taught?  She did not understand; she only knew that hope\nwas as strong within her as health itself--and that she did not\nwant to die--and that at present she was helpless.\n\nOne evening the man she was with--a good-looking and unusually\ninteresting young chap--suddenly said:\n\n\"What a heart action you have got!  Let me listen to that again.\"\n\n\"Is it all wrong?\" asked Susan, as he pressed his ear against\nher chest.\n\n\"You ask that as if you rather hoped it was.\"\n\n\"I do--and I don't.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said he, after listening for a third time, \"you'll\nnever die of heart trouble.  I never heard a heart with such a\ngrand action--like a big, powerful pump, built to last forever.\nYou're never ill, are you?\"\n\n\"Not thus far.\"\n\n\"And you'll have a hard time making yourself ill.  Health?  Why,\nyour health must be perfect.  Let me see.\"  And he proceeded to\nthump and press upon her chest with an expertness that proclaimed\nthe student of medicine.  He was all interest and enthusiasm,\ntook a pencil and, spreading a sheet upon her chest over her\nheart, drew its outlines.  \"There!\" he cried.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Susan.  \"I don't understand.\"\n\nThe young man drew a second and much smaller heart within the\noutline of hers.  \"This,\" he explained, \"is about the size of\nan ordinary heart.  You can see for yourself that yours is\nfully one-fourth bigger than the normal.\"\n\n\"What of it?\" said Susan.\n\n\"Why, health and strength--and vitality--courage--hope--all\none-fourth above the ordinary allowance.  Yes, more than a\nfourth.  I envy you.  You ought to live long, stay young until\nyou're very old--and get pretty much anything you please.  You\ndon't belong to this life.  Some accident, I guess.  Every once\nin a while I run across a case something like yours.  You'll go\nback where you belong.  This is a dip, not a drop.\"\n\n\"You sound like a fortune-teller.\"  She was smiling mockingly.\nBut in truth she had never in all her life heard words that\nthrilled her so, that heartened her so.\n\n\"I am.  A scientific fortune-teller.  And what that kind says\ncomes true, barring accidents.  As you're not ignorant and\ncareless this life of yours isn't physiologically bad.  On the\ncontrary, you're out in the open air much of the time and get\nthe splendid exercise of walking--a much more healthful life,\nin the essential ways, than respectable women lead.  They're\nalways stuffing, and rumping it.  They never move if they can\nhelp.  No, nothing can stop you but death--unless you're far less\nintelligent than you look.  Oh, yes--death and one other thing.\"\n\n\"Drink.\"  And he looked shrewdly at her.\n\nBut drink she must.  And each day, as soon as she dressed and\nwas out in the street, she began to drink, and kept it up until\nshe had driven off the depression and had got herself into the\nmood of recklessness in which she found a certain sardonic\npleasure in outraging her own sensibilities.  There is a stage\nin a drinking career when the man or the woman becomes depraved\nand ugly as soon as the liquor takes effect.  But she was far\nfrom this advanced stage.  Her disposition was, if anything,\nmore sweet and generous when she was under the influence of\nliquor.  The whiskey--she almost always drank whiskey--seemed\nto act directly and only upon the nerves that ached and\nthrobbed when she was sober, the nerves that made the life she\nwas leading seem loathsome beyond the power of habit to\naccustom.  With these nerves stupefied, her natural gayety\nasserted itself, and a fondness for quiet and subtle\nmockery--her indulgence in it did not make her popular with\nvain men sufficiently acute to catch her meaning.\n\nBy observation and practice she was soon able to measure the\nexact amount of liquor that was necessary to produce the proper\nstate of intoxication at the hour for going \"on duty.\"  That\ngayety of hers was of the surface only.  Behind it her real\nself remained indifferent or somber or sardonic, according to\nher mood of the day.  And she had the sense of being in the\ngrasp of a hideous, fascinating nightmare, of being dragged\nthrough some dreadful probation from which she would presently\nemerge to ascend to the position she would have earned by her\ndesperate fortitude.  The past--unreal.  The present--a waking\ndream.  But the future--ah, the future!\n\nHe has not candidly explored far beneath the surface of things\nwho does not know the strange allure, charm even, that many\nloathsome things possess.  And drink is peculiarly fitted to\nbring out this perverse quality--drink that blurs all the\nconventionalities, even those built up into moral ideas by\ncenturies and ages of unbroken custom.  The human animal, for\nall its pretenses of inflexibility, is almost infinitely\nadaptable--that is why it has risen in several million years of\nevolution from about the humblest rank in the mammalian family\nto overlordship of the universe.  Still, it is doubtful if,\nwithout drink to help her, a girl of Susan's intelligence and\ntemperament would have been apt to endure.  She would probably\nhave chosen the alternative--death.  Hundreds, perhaps\nthousands, of girls, at least her equals in sensibility, are\ncaught in the same calamity every year, tens of thousands, ever\nmore and more as our civilization transforms under the pressure\nof industrialism, are caught in the similar calamities of\nsoul-destroying toil.  And only the few survive who have\nperfect health and abounding vitality.  Susan's iron strength\nenabled her to live; but it was drink that enabled her to\nendure.  Beyond question one of the greatest blessings that\ncould now be conferred upon the race would be to cure it of the\ndrink evil.  But at the same time, if drink were taken away\nbefore the causes of drink were removed, there would be an\nappalling increase in suicide--in insanity, in the general\ntotal of human misery.  For while drink retards the growth of\nintelligent effort to end the stupidities in the social system,\ndoes it not also help men and women to bear the consequences of\nthose stupidities?  Our crude and undeveloped new civilization,\nstrapping men and women and children to the machines and\nsqueezing all the energy out of them, all the capacity for\nvital life, casts them aside as soon as they are useless but\nlong before they are dead.  How unutterably wretched they would\nbe without drink to give them illusions!\n\nSusan grew fond of cigarettes, fond of whiskey; to the rest\nshe after a few weeks became numb--no new or strange phenomenon\nin a world where people with a cancer or other hideous running\nsore or some gross and frightful deformity of fat or\nexcrescence are seen laughing, joining freely and comfortably\nin the company of the unafflicted.  In her affliction Susan at\nleast saw only those affected like herself--and that helped not\na little, helped the whiskey to confuse and distort her outlook\nupon life.\n\nThe old Cartesian formula--\"I think, therefore I am\"--would\ncome nearer to expressing a truth, were it reversed--\"I am,\ntherefore I think.\"  Our characters are compressed, and our\nthoughts bent by our environment.  And most of us are\nunconscious of our slavery because our environment remains\nunchanged from birth until death, and so seems the whole\nuniverse to us.\n\nIn spite of her life, in spite of all she did to disguise\nherself, there persisted in her face--even when she was dazed or\ngiddied or stupefied with drink--the expression of the woman on\nthe right side of the line.  Whether it was something in her\ncharacter, whether it was not rather due to superiority of\nbreeding and intelligence, would be difficult to say.  However,\nthere was the _different_ look that irritated many of the other\ngirls, interfered with her business and made her feel a\nhypocrite.  She heard so much about the paleness of her lips\nthat she decided to end that comment by using paint--the\ndurable kind Ida had recommended.  When her lips flamed\ncarmine, a strange and striking effect resulted.  The sad sweet\npensiveness of her eyes--the pallor of her clear skin--then,\nthat splash of bright red, artificial, bold, defiant--the\ncontrast of the combination seemed somehow to tell the story of\nher life her past no less than her present.  And when her\nbeauty began to come back--for, hard though her life was, it\nwas a life of good food, of plenty of sleep, of much open air;\nso it put no such strain upon her as had the life of the\nfactory and the tenement--when her beauty came back, the effect\nof that contrast of scarlet splash against the sad purity of\npallid cheeks and violet-gray eyes became a mark of\nindividuality, of distinction.  It was not long before Susan\nwould have as soon thought of issuing forth with her body\nuncovered as with her lips unrouged.\n\nShe turned away from men who sought her a second time.  She was\ndifficult to find, she went on \"duty\" only enough days each\nweek to earn a low average of what was expected from the girls\nby their protectors.  Yet she got many unexpected presents--and\nso had money to lend to the other girls, who soon learned how\n\"easy\" she was.\n\nMaud, sometimes at her own prompting, sometimes prompted by\nJim, who was prompted by Freddie--warned her every few days that\nshe was skating on the thinnest of ice.  But she went her way.\nNot until she accompanied a girl to an opium joint to discover\nwhether dope had the merits claimed for it as a deadener of\npain and a producer of happiness--not until then did Freddie\ncome in person.\n\n\"I hear,\" said he and she wondered whether he had heard from\nMax or from loose-tongued Maud--\"that you come into the hotel\nso drunk that men sometimes leave you right away again--go\nwithout paying you.\"\n\n\"I must drink,\" said Susan.\n\n\"You must _stop_ drink,\" retorted he, amiable in his terrible\nway.  \"If you don't, I'll have you pinched and sent up.\nThat'll bring you to your senses.\"\n\n\"I must drink,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Then I must have you pinched,\" said he with his mocking laugh.\n\"Don't be a fool,\" he went on.  \"You can make money enough to\nsoon buy the right sort of clothes so that I can afford to be\nseen with you.  I'd like to take you out once in a while and\ngive you a swell time.  But what'd we look like together--with\nyou in those cheap things out of bargain troughs?  Not that you\ndon't look well--for you do.  But the rest of you isn't up to\nyour feet and to the look in your face.  The whole thing's got to\nbe right before a lady can sit opposite _me_ in Murray's or Rector's.\"\n\n\"All I ask is to be let alone,\" said Susan.\n\n\"That isn't playing square--and you've got to play square.  What\nI want is to set you up in a nice parlor trade--chaps from the\ncollege and the swell clubs and hotels.  But I can't do\nanything for you as long as you drink this way.  You'll have to\nstay on the streets.\"\n\n\"That's where I want to stay.\"\n\n\"Well, there's something to be said for the streets,\" Freddie\nadmitted.  \"If a woman don't intend to make sporting her life\nbusiness, she don't want to get up among the swells of the\nprofession, where she'd become known and find it hard to\nsidestep.  Still, even in the street you ought to make a\nhundred, easy--and not go with any man that doesn't suit you.\"\n\n\"Any man that doesn't suit me,\" said Susan.  And, after a\npause, she said it again:  \"Any man that doesn't suit me.\"\n\nThe young man, with his shrewdness of the street-graduate and\nhis sensitiveness of the Italian, gave her an understanding\nglance.  \"You look as if you couldn't decide whether to laugh\nor cry.  I'd try to laugh if I was you.\"\n\nShe had laughed as he spoke.\n\nFreddie nodded approval.  \"That sounded good to me.  You're\ngetting broken in.  Don't take yourself so seriously.  After\nall, what are you doing?  Why, learning to live like a man.\"\n\nShe found this new point of view interesting--and true, too.\nLike a man--like all men, except possibly a few--not enough\nexceptions to change the rule.  Like a man; getting herself\nhardened up to the point where she could take part in the cruel\nstruggle on equal terms with the men.  It wasn't their\ndifference of body any more than it was their difference of\ndress that handicapped women; it was the idea behind skirt and\nsex--and she was getting rid of that.  .  .  .\n\nThe theory was admirable; but it helped her not at all in\npractice.  She continued to keep to the darkness, to wait in\nthe deep doorways, so far as she could in her \"business hours,\"\nand to repulse advances in the day time or in public\nplaces--and to drink.  She did not go again to the opium joint,\nand she resisted the nightly offers of girls and their\n\"gentlemen friends\" to try cocaine in its various forms.\n\"Dope,\" she saw, was the medicine of despair.  And she was far\nfrom despair.  Had she not youth?  Had she not health and\nintelligence and good looks?  Some day she would have finished\nher apprenticeship.  Then--the career!\n\nFreddie let her alone for nearly a month, though she was\nearning less than fifty dollars a week--which meant only thirty\nfor him.  He had never \"collected\" from her directly, but\nalways through Jim; and she had now learned enough of the\nmethods of the system of which she was one of the thousands of\nslaves to appreciate that she was treated by Jim with unique\nconsideration.  Not only by the surly and brutal Jim, but also\nby the police who oppressed in petty ways wherever they dared\nbecause they hated Freddie's system which took away from them\na part of the graft they regarded as rightfully theirs.\n\nYes, rightfully theirs.  And anyone disposed to be critical of\npolice morality--or of Freddie Palmer morality--in this matter\nof graft would do well to pause and consider the source of his\nown income before he waxes too eloquent and too virtuous.\nGraft is one of those general words that mean everything and\nnothing.  What is graft and what is honest income?  Just where\nshall we draw the line between rightful exploitation of our\nfellow-beings through their necessities and their ignorance of\ntheir helplessness, and wrongful exploitation?  Do attempts to\ndraw that line resolve down to making virtuous whatever I may\nappropriate and vicious whatever is appropriated in ways other\nthan mine?  And if so are not the police and the Palmers\nentitled to their day in the moral court no less than the\ntariff-baron and market-cornerer, the herder and driver of wage\nslaves, the retail artists in cold storage filth, short weight\nand shoddy goods?  However, \"we must draw the line somewhere\"\nor there will be no such thing as morality under our social\nsystem.  So why not draw it at anything the other fellow does\nto make money.  In adopting this simple rule, we not only\npreserve the moralities from destruction but also establish our\nown virtue and the other fellow's villainy.  Truly, never is\nthe human race so delightfully, so unconsciously, amusing as\nwhen it discusses right and wrong.\n\nWhen she saw Freddie again, he was far from sober.  He showed\nit by his way of beginning.  Said he:\n\n\"I've got to hand you a line of rough talk, Queenie.  I took on\nthis jag for your especial benefit,\" said he.  \"I'm a fool\nabout you and you take advantage of it.  That's bad for both of\nus.  .  .  .  You're drinking as much as ever?\"\n\n\"More,\" replied she.  \"It takes more and more.\"\n\n\"How can you expect to get on?\" cried he, exasperated.\n\n\"As I told you, I couldn't make a cent if I didn't drink.\"\n\nFreddie stared moodily at her, then at the floor--they were in\nher room.  Finally he said:\n\n\"You get the best class of men.  I put my swell friends on to\nwhere you go slipping by, up and down in the shadow--and it's\nall they can do to find you.  The best class of men--men all\nthe swell respectable girls in town are crazy to hook up\nwith--those of 'em that ain't married already.  If you're good\nenough for those chaps they ought to be good enough for you.\nYet some of 'em complain to me that they get thrown down--and\nothers kick because you were too full--and, damn it, you act so\nqueer that you scare 'em away.  What am I to do about it?\"\n\nShe was silent.\n\n\"I want you to promise me you'll take a brace.\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"You won't promise?\"\n\n\"No--because I don't intend to.  I'm doing the best I can.\"\n\n\"You think I'm a good thing.  You think I'll take anything off\nyou, because I'm stuck on you--and appreciate that you ain't on\nthe same level with the rest of these heifers.  Well--I'll not\nlet any woman con me.  I never have.  I never will.  And I'll\nmake you realize that you're not square with me.  I'll let you\nget a taste of life as it is when a girl hasn't got a friend\nwith a pull.\"\n\n\"As you please,\" said Susan indifferently.  \"I don't in the\nleast care what happens to me.\"\n\n\"We'll see about that,\" cried he, enraged.  \"I'll give you a\nweek to brace up in.\"\n\nThe look he shot at her by way of finish to his sentence was\nmenacing enough.  But she was not disturbed; these signs of\nanger tended to confirm her in her sense of security from him.\nFor it was wholly unlike the Freddie Palmer the rest of the\nworld knew, to act in this irresolute and stormy way.  She knew\nthat Palmer, in his fashion, cared for her--better still, liked\nher--liked to talk with her, liked to show--and to develop--the\naspiring side of his interesting, unusual nature for her benefit.\n\nA week passed, during which she did not see him.  But she heard\nthat he was losing on both the cards and the horses and was\ndrinking wildly.  A week--ten days--then----\n\nOne night, as she came out of a saloon a block or so down Seventh\nAvenue from Forty-second, a fly cop seized her by the arm.\n\n\"Come along,\" said he roughly.  \"You're drinking and\nsoliciting.  I've got to clear the streets of some of these\ntarts.  It's got so decent people can't move without falling\nover 'em.\"\n\nSusan had not lived in the tenement districts where the\nignorance and the helplessness and the lack of a voice that can\nmake itself heard among the ruling classes make the sway of the\npolice absolute and therefore tyrannical--she had not lived\nthere without getting something of that dread and horror of the\npolice which to people of the upper classes seems childish or\nevidence of secret criminal hankerings.  And this nervousness\nhad latterly been increased to terror by what she had learned\nfrom her fellow-outcasts--the hideous tales of oppression, of\nrobbery, of bodily and moral degradation.  But all this terror\nhad been purely fanciful, as any emotion not of experience\nproves to be when experience evokes the reality.  At that\ntouch, at the sound of those rough words--at that _reality_ of\nthe terror she had imagined from the days when she went to work\nat Matson's and to live with the Brashears, she straightway\nlost consciousness.  When her senses returned she was in a\ncell, lying on a wooden bench.\n\nThere must have been some sort of wild struggle; for her\nclothes were muddy, her hat was crushed into shapelessness, her\nveil was so torn that she had difficulty in arranging it to act\nas any sort of concealment.  Though she had no mirror at which\nto discover the consolation, she need have had no fear of being\nrecognized, so distorted were all her features by the frightful\nparoxysms of grief that swept and ravaged her body that night.\nShe fainted again when they led her out to put her in the wagon.\n\nShe fainted a third time when she heard her name--\"Queenie\nBrown\"--bellowed out by the court officer.  They shook her into\nconsciousness, led her to the court-room.  She was conscious of\na stifling heat, of a curious crowd staring at her with eyes\nwhich seemed to bore red hot holes into her flesh.  As she\nstood before the judge, with head limp upon her bosom, she\nheard in her ear a rough voice bawling, \"You're discharged.\nThe judge says don't come here again.\"  And she was pushed\nthrough an iron gate.  She walked unsteadily up the aisle,\nbetween two masses of those burning-eyed human monsters.  She\nfelt the cold outside air like a vast drench of icy water flung\nupon her.  If it had been raining, she might have gone toward\nthe river.  But than that day New York had never been more\nradiantly the City of the Sun.  How she got home she never\nknew, but late in the afternoon she realized that she was in\nher own room.\n\nHour after hour she lay upon the bed, body and mind inert.\nHelpless--no escape--no courage to live--yet no wish to die.\nHow much longer would it last?  Surely the waking from this\ndream must come soon.\n\n\nAbout noon the next day Freddie came.  \"I let you off easy,\"\nsaid he, sitting on the bed upon which she was lying dressed as\nwhen she came in the day before.  \"Have you been drinking again?\"\n\n\"No,\" she muttered.\n\n\"Well--don't.  Next time, a week on the Island. . . .  Did you hear?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Don't turn me against you.  I'd hate to have to make an awful\nexample of you.\"\n\n\"I must drink,\" she repeated in the same stolid way.\n\nHe abruptly but without shock lifted her to a sitting position.\nHis arm held her body up; her head was thrown back and her face\nwas looking calmly at him.  She realized that he had been\ndrinking--drinking hard.  Her eyes met his terrible eyes\nwithout flinching.  He kissed her full upon the lips.  With her\nopen palm she struck him across the cheek, bringing the red\nfierily to its smooth fair surface.  The devil leaped into his\neyes, the devil of cruelty and lust.  He smiled softly and\nwickedly.  \"I see you've forgotten the lesson I gave you three\nmonths ago.  You've got to be taught to be afraid all over again.\"\n\n\"I _am_ not afraid,\" said she.  \"I _was_ not afraid.  You can't\nmake me afraid.\"\n\n\"We'll see,\" murmured he.  And his fingers began to caress her\nround smooth throat.\n\n\"If you ever strike me again,\" she said quietly, \"I'll kill you.\"\n\nHis eyes flinched for an instant--long enough to let her know\nhis innermost secret.  \"I want you--I want _you_--damn you,\" he\nsaid, between his clinched teeth.  \"You're the first one I\ncouldn't get.  There's something in you I can't get!\"\n\n\"That's _me_,\" she replied.\n\n\"You hate me, don't you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then you love me?\"\n\n\"No.  I care nothing about you.\"\n\nHe let her drop back to the bed, went to the window, stood\nlooking out moodily.  After a while he said without turning:\n\n\"My mother kept a book shop--on the lower East Side.  She\nbrought me up at home.  At home!\"  And he laughed sardonically.\n\"She hated me because I looked like my father.\"\n\nSilence, then he spoke again:\n\n\"You've never been to my flat.  I've got a swell place.  I want\nto cut out this part of the game.  I can get along without it.\nYou're going to move in with me, and stop this street business.\nI make good money.  You can have everything you want.\"\n\n\"I prefer to keep on as I am.\"\n\n\"What's the difference?  Aren't you mine whenever I want you?\"\n\n\"I prefer to be free.\"\n\n\"_Free!_  Why, you're not free.  Can't I send you to the Island\nany time I feel like it--just as I can the other girls?\"\n\n\"Yes--you can do that.  But I'm free, all the same.\"\n\n\"No more than the other girls.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Unless you understand, I couldn't make you see it,\" she said.\nShe was sitting on the edge of the bed, doing up her hair,\nwhich had partly fallen down.  \"I think you do understand.\"\n\n\"What in the hell do you want, anyhow?\" he demanded.\n\n\"If I knew--do you suppose I'd be here?\"\n\nHe watched her with baffled, longing eyes.  \"What is it,\" he\nmuttered, \"that's so damn peculiar about you?\"\n\nIt was the question every shrewd observant person who saw her\nput to himself in one way or another; and there was excellent\nreason why this should have been.\n\nLife has a certain set of molds--lawyer, financier, gambler,\npreacher, fashionable woman, prostitute, domestic woman,\nlaborer, clerk, and so on through a not extensive list of\nfamiliar types with which we all soon become acquainted.  And\nto one or another of these patterns life fits each of us as we\ngrow up.  Not one in ten thousand glances into human faces is\narrested because it has lit upon a personality that cannot be\nimmediately located, measured, accounted for.  The reason for\nthis sterility of variety which soon makes the world rather\nmonotonous to the seeing eye is that few of us are born with\nany considerable amount of personality, and what little we have\nis speedily suppressed by a system of training which is\nthroughout based upon an abhorrence of originality.  We obey\nthe law of nature--and nature so abhors variety that, whenever\na variation from a type happens, she tries to kill it, and,\nthat failing, reproduces it a myriad times to make it a type.\nWhen an original man or woman appears and all the strenuous\neffort to suppress him or her fails, straightway spring up a\nthousand imitators and copiers, and the individuality is lost\nin the school, the fashion, the craze.  We have not the courage\nto be ourselves, even where there is anything in us that might\nbe developed into something distinctive enough to win us the\nrank of real identity.  Individuality--distinction--where it\ndoes exist, almost never shows until experience brings it\nout--just as up to a certain stage the embryo of any animal is\nlike that of every other animal, though there is latent in it\nthe most positive assertion of race and sex, of family, type,\nand so on.\n\nSusan had from childhood possessed certain qualities of\nphysical beauty, of spiritedness, of facility in mind and\nbody--the not uncommon characteristic of the child that is the\nflower of passionate love.  But now there was beginning to show\nin her a radical difference from the rest of the crowd pouring\nthrough the streets of the city.  It made the quicker observers\nin the passing throng turn the head for a second and wondering\nglance.  Most of them assumed they had been stirred by her\nsuperiority of face and figure.  But striking faces and figures\nof the various comely types are frequent in the streets of New\nYork and of several other American cities.  The truth was that\nthey were interested by her expression--an elusive expression\ntelling of a soul that was being moved to its depths by\nexperience which usually finds and molds mere passive material.\nThis expression was as evident in her mouth as in her eyes, in\nher profile as in her full face.  And as she sat there on the\nedge of the bed twisting up her thick dark hair, it was this\nexpression that disconcerted Freddie Palmer, for the first time\nin all his contemptuous dealings with the female sex.  In his\neyes was a ferocious desire to seize her and again try to\nconquer and to possess.\n\nShe had become almost unconscious of his presence.  He startled\nher by suddenly crying, \"Oh, you go to hell!\" and flinging from\nthe room, crashing the door shut behind him.\n\n\nMaud had grown tired of the haberdasher's clerk and his\npresumptions upon her frank fondness which he wholly\nmisunderstood.  She had dropped him for a rough looking\nwaiter-singer in a basement drinking place.  He was beating her\nand taking all the money she had for herself, and was spending\nit on another woman, much older than Maud and homely--and Maud\nknew, and complained of him bitterly to everyone but himself.\nShe was no longer hanging round Susan persistently, having been\ndiscouraged by the failure of her attempts at intimacy with a\ngirl who spent nearly all her spare time at reading or at plays\nand concerts.  Maud was now chumming with a woman who preyed\nupon the patrons of a big Broadway hotel--she picked them up\nnear the entrance, robbed them, and when they asked the hotel\ndetectives to help them get back their stolen money, the\ndetectives, who divided with her, frightened them off by saying\nshe was a mulatto and would compel them to make a public\nappearance against her in open court.  This woman, older and\nharder than most of the girls, though of quiet and refined\nappearance and manner, was rapidly dragging Maud down.  Also,\nMaud's looks were going because she ate irregularly all kinds\nof trash, and late every night ate herself full to bursting and\ndrank herself drunk to stupefaction.\n\nSusan's first horror of the men she met--men of all\nclasses--was rapidly modified into an inconsistent, therefore\ncharacteristically human, mingling of horror and tolerance.\nNobody, nothing, was either good or bad, but all veered like\nweathercocks in the shifting wind.  She decided that people\nwere steadily good only where their lot happened to be cast in\na place in which the good wind held steadily, and that those\nwho were usually bad simply had the misfortune to have to live\nwhere the prevailing winds were bad.\n\nFor instance, there was the handsome, well educated, well\nmannered young prize-fighter, Ned Ballou, who was Estelle's\n\"friend.\"  Ballou, big and gentle and as incapable of bad humor\nas of constancy or of honesty about money matters, fought under\nthe name of Joe Geary and was known as Upper Cut Joe because\nusually, in the third round, never later than the fifth, he\ngave the knockout to his opponent by a cruelly swift and savage\nuppercut.  He had educated himself marvelously well.  But he\nhad been brought up among thieves and had by some curious freak\nnever learned to know what a moral sense was, which is one--and\na not unattractive--step deeper down than those who know what\na moral sense is but never use it.  At supper in Gaffney's he\nrelated to Susan and Estelle how he had won his greatest\nvictory--the victory of Terry the Cyclone, that had lifted him\nup into the class of secure money-makers.  He told how he\nalways tried to \"rattle\" his opponent by talking to him, by\npouring out in an undertone a stream of gibes, jeers, insults.\nThe afternoon of the fight Terry's first-born had died, but the\nmoney for the funeral expenses and to save the wife from the\nhorrors and dangers of the free wards had to be earned.  Joe\nGeary knew that he must win this fight or drop into the working\nor the criminal class.  Terry was a \"hard one\";  so\ncircumstances compelled, those desperate measures which great\nmen, from financiers and generals down to prize-fighters, do\nnot shrink from else they would not be great, but small.\n\nAs soon as he was facing Terry in the ring--Joe so he related\nwith pride in his cleverness--began to \"guy\"--\"Well, you Irish\nfake--so the kid's dead--eh?  Who was its pa, say?--the dirty\nlittle bastard--or does the wife know which one it was----\" and\nso on.  And Terry, insane with grief and fury, fought wild--and\nJoe became a champion.\n\nAs she listened Susan grew cold with horror and with hate.\nEstelle said:\n\n\"Tell the rest of it, Joe.\"\n\n\"Oh, that was nothing,\" replied he.\n\nWhen he strolled away to talk with some friends Estelle told\n\"the rest\" that was \"nothing.\"  The championship secure, Joe\nhad paid all Terry's bills, had supported Terry and his wife\nfor a year, had relapsed into old habits and \"pulled off a job\"\nof safe-cracking because, the prize-fighting happening to pay\npoorly, he would have had a default on the payments for a month\nor so.  He was caught, did a year on the Island before his\n\"pull\" could get him out.  And all the time he was in the \"pen\"\nhe so arranged it with his friends that the invalid Terry and\nhis invalid wife did not suffer.  And all this he had done not\nbecause he had a sense of owing Terry, but because he was of\nthe \"set\" in which it is the custom to help anybody who happens\nto need it, and aid begun becomes an obligation to \"see it through.\"\n\nIt was an extreme case of the moral chaos about her--the chaos\nshe had begun to discover when she caught her aunt and Ruth\nconspiring to take Sam away from her.\n\nWhat a world!  If only these shifting, usually evil winds of\ncircumstance could be made to blow good!\n\nA few evenings after the arrest Maud came for Susan, persuaded\nher to go out.  They dined at about the only good restaurant\nwhere unescorted women were served after nightfall.  Afterward\nthey went \"on duty.\"  It was fine overhead and the air was\ncold and bracing--one of those marvelous New York winter nights\nwhich have the tonic of both sea and mountains and an\nexhilaration, in addition, from the intense bright-burning life\nof the mighty city.  For more than a week there had been a\nsteady downpour of snow, sleet and finally rain.  Thus, the\nwomen of the streets had been doing almost no business.  There\nwas not much money in sitting in drinking halls and the back\nrooms of saloons and picking up occasional men; the best trade\nwas the men who would not venture to show themselves in such\nfrankly disreputable places, but picked out women in the\ncrowded streets and followed them to quiet dark places to make\nthe arrangements--men stimulated by good dinners, or, later on,\nin the evening, those who left parties of elegant\nrespectability after theater or opera.  On this first night of\nbusiness weather in nearly two weeks the streets were crowded\nwith women and girls.  They were desperately hard up and they\nmade open dashes for every man they could get at.  All classes\nwere made equally bold--the shop and factory and office and\ntheater girls with wages too small for what they regarded as a\ndecent living; the women with young children to support and\neducate; the protected professional regulars; the miserable\ncreatures who had to get along as best they could without\nprotection, and were prey to every blackmailing officer of an\nanti-vice society and to every policeman and fly-cop not above\nlevying upon women who were \"too low to be allowed to live,\nanyhow.\"  Out from all kinds of shelters swarmed the women who\nwere demonstrating how prostitution flourishes and tends to\nspread to every class of society whenever education develops\ntastes beyond the earning power of their possessors.  And with\nclothes and food to buy, rent to pay, dependents to support,\nthese women, so many days hampered in the one way that was open\nto them to get money, made the most piteous appeals to the men.\nNot tearful appeals, not appeals to sympathy or even to\ncharity, but to passion.  They sought in every way to excite.\nThey exhibited their carefully gotten-up legs; they made\nindecent gestures; they said the vilest things; they offered\nthe vilest inducements; they lowered their prices down and\ndown.  And such men as did not order them off with disdain,\nlistened with laughter, made jokes at which the wretched\ncreatures laughed as gayly as if they were not mad with anxiety\nand were not hating these men who were holding on to that which\nthey must have to live.\n\n\"Too many out tonight,\" said Maud as they walked their\nbeat--Forty-second between Broadway and Eighth Avenue.  \"I knew\nit would be this way.  Let's go in here and get warm.\"\n\nThey went into the back room of a saloon where perhaps half a\ndozen women were already seated, some of them gray with the\ncold against which their thin showy garments were no\nprotection.  Susan and Maud sat at a table in a corner; Maud\nbroke her rule and drank whiskey with Susan.  After they had\ntaken perhaps half a dozen drinks, Maud grew really\nconfidential.  She always, even in her soberest moments, seemed\nto be telling everything she knew; but Susan had learned that\nthere were in her many deep secrets, some of which not even\nliquor could unlock.\n\n\"I'm going to tell you something,\" she now said to Susan.  \"You\nmust promise not to give me away.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me,\" replied Susan.  She was used to being\nflattered--or victimized, according to the point of view--with\nconfidences.  She assumed Maud was about to confess some secret\nabout her own self, as she had the almost universal habit of\nnever thinking of anyone else.  \"Don't tell me,\" said she.\n\"I'm tired of being used to air awful secrets.  It makes me\nfeel like a tenement wash line.\"\n\n\"This is about you,\" said Maud.  \"If it's ever found out that\nI put you wise, Jim'll have me killed.  Yes--killed.\"\n\nSusan, reckless by this time, laughed.  \"Oh, trash!\" she said.\n\n\"No trash at all,\" insisted Maud.  \"When you know this town\nthrough and through you'll know that murder's something that\ncan be arranged as easy as buying a drink.  What risk is there\nin making one of _us_ 'disappear'?  None in the world.  I always\nfeel that Jim'll have me killed some day--unless I go crazy\nsometime and kill him.  He's stuck on me--or, at least, he's\njealous of me--and if he ever found out I had a\nlover--somebody--anybody that didn't pay--why, it'd be all up\nwith me.  Little Maud would go on the grill.\"\n\nShe ordered and slowly drank another whiskey before she\nrecalled what she had set out to confide.  By way of a fresh\nstart she said, \"What do you think of Freddie?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Susan.  And it was the truth.  Her\ninstinctive belief in a modified kind of fatalism made her\njudgments of people--even of those who caused her to\nsuffer--singularly free from personal bitterness.  Freddie, a\nmere instrument of destiny, had his good side, his human side,\nshe knew.  At his worst he was no worse than the others, And\naside from his queer magnetism, there was a certain force in\nhim that compelled her admiration; at least he was not one of\nthe petty instruments of destiny.  He had in him the same\nquality she felt gestating within herself.  \"I don't know what\nto think,\" she repeated.\n\nMaud had been reflecting while Susan was casting about, as she\nhad many a time before, for her real opinion of her master who\nwas in turn the slave of Finnegan, who was in his turn the\nslave of somebody higher up, she didn't exactly know who--or\nwhy--or the why of any of it--or the why of the grotesque\nsavage purposeless doings of destiny in general.  Maud now\nburst out:\n\n\"I don't care.  I'm going to put you wise if I die for it.\"\n\n\"Don't,\" said Susan.  \"I don't want to know.\"\n\n\"But I've _got_ to tell you.  Do you know what Freddie's going to do?\"\n\nSusan smiled disdainfully.  \"I don't care.  You mustn't tell\nme--when you've been drinking this way----\"\n\n\"Finnegan's police judge is a man named Bennett.  As soon as\nBennett comes back to Jefferson Market Police Court, Freddie's\ngoing to have you sent up for three months.\"\n\nSusan's glass was on the way to her lips.  She set it down\nagain.  The drunken old wreck of an entertainer at the piano in\nthe corner was bellowing out his favorite song--\"I Am the King\nof the Vikings.\"  Susan began to hum the air.\n\n\"It's gospel,\" cried Maud, thinking Susan did not believe her.\n\"He's a queer one, is Freddie.  They're all afraid of him.\nYou'd think he was a coward, the way he bullies women and that.\nBut somehow he ain't--not a bit.  He'll be a big man in the\norganization some day, they all say.  He never lets up till he\ngets square.  And he thinks you're not square--after all he's\ndone for you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not--as he looks at it,\" said Susan.\n\n\"And Jim says he's crazy in love with you, and that he wants to\nput you where other men can't see you and where maybe he can\nget over caring about you.  That's the real reason.  He's a\nqueer devil.  But then all men are though none quite like Freddie.\"\n\n\"So I'm to go to the Island for three months,\" said Susan reflectively.\n\n\"You don't seem to care.  It's plain you never was there. . . .\nAnd you've got to go.  There's no way out of it--unless you\nskip to another city.  And if you did you never could come back\nhere.  Freddie'd see that you got yours as soon as you landed.\"\n\nSusan sat looking at her glass.  Maud watched her in\nastonishment.  \"You're as queer as Freddie,\" said she at\nlength.  \"I never feel as if I was acquainted with you--not\nreally.  I never had a lady friend like that before.  You don't\nseem to be a bit excited about what Freddie's going to do.  Are\nyou in love with him?\"\n\nSusan lifted strange, smiling eyes to Maud's curious gaze.\n\"I--in _love_--with a _man_,\" she said slowly.  And then she laughed.\n\n\"Don't laugh that way,\" cried Maud.  \"It gives me the creeps.\nWhat are you going to do?\"\n\n\"What can I do?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Then if there's nothing to do, I'll no nothing.\"\n\n\"Go to the Island for three months?\"\n\nSusan shrugged her shoulders.  \"I haven't gone yet.\"  She rose.\n\"It's too stuffy and smelly in here,\" said she.  \"Let's move out.\"\n\n\"No.  I'll wait.  I promised to meet a gentleman friend here.\nYou'll not tell that I tipped you off?\"\n\n\"You'd not have told me if you hadn't known I wouldn't.\"\n\n\"That's so.  But--why don't you make it up with Freddie?\"\n\n\"I couldn't do that.\"\n\n\"He's dead in love.  I'm sure you could.\"\n\nAgain Susan's eyes became strange.  \"I'm sure I couldn't.  Good\nnight.\"  She got as far as the door, came back.  \"Thank you for\ntelling me.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" murmured the girl.  She was embarrassed\nby Susan's manner.  She was frightened by Susan's eyes.  \"You\nain't going to----\" There she halted.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"To jump off?  Kill yourself?\"\n\n\"Hardly,\" said Susan.  \"I've got a lot to do before I die.\"\n\nShe went directly home.  Palmer was lying on the bed, a\ncigarette between his lips, a newspaper under his feet to\nprevent his boots from spoiling the spread--one of the many\nsmall indications of the prudence, thrift and calculation that\nunderlay the almost insane recklessness of his surface\ncharacter, and that would save him from living as the fool\nlives and dying as the fool dies.\n\n\"I thought you wouldn't slop round in these streets long,\" said\nhe, as she paused upon the threshold.  \"So I waited.\"\n\nShe went to the bureau, unlocked the top drawer, took the\nten-dollar bill she had under some undershirts there, put it in\nher right stocking where there were already a five and a two.\nShe locked the drawer, tossed the key into an open box of\nhairpins.  She moved toward the door.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" asked he, still staring at the ceiling.\n\n\"Out.  I've made almost nothing this week.\"\n\n\"Sit down.  I want to talk to you.\"\n\nShe hesitated, seated herself on a chair near the bed.\n\nHe frowned at her.  \"You've been drinking?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I've been drinking myself, but I've got a nose like a hunting\ndog.  What do you do it for?\"\n\n\"What's the use of explaining?  You'd not understand.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I would.  I'm one-fourth Italian--and they understand\neverything. . . .  You're fond of reading, aren't you?\"\n\n\"It passes the time.\"\n\n\"While I was waiting for you I glanced at your new\nbooks--Emerson--Dickens--Zola.\"  He was looking toward the row of\npaper backs that filled almost the whole length of the mantel.\n\"I must read them.  I always like your books.  You spend nearly\nas much time reading as I do--and you don't need it, for you've\ngot a good education.  What do you read for?  To amuse yourself?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"To get away from yourself?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then why?\" persisted he.\n\n\"To find out about myself.\"\n\nHe thought a moment, turned his face toward her.  \"You _are_\nclever!\" he said admiringly.  \"What's your game?\"\n\n\"My game?\"\n\n\"What are you aiming for?  You've got too much sense not to be\naiming for something.\"\n\nShe looked at him; the expression that marked her as a person\npeculiar and apart was glowing in her eyes like a bed of\nred-hot coals covered with ashes.\n\n\"What?\" he repeated.\n\n\"To get strong,\" replied she.  \"Women are born weak and bred\nweaker.  I've got to get over being a woman.  For there isn't\nany place in this world for a woman except under the shelter of\nsome man.  And I don't want that.\"  The underlying strength of\nher features abruptly came into view.  \"And I won't have it,\"\nshe added.\n\nHe laughed.  \"But the men'll never let _you_ be anything but a woman.\"\n\n\"We'll see,\" said she, smiling.  The strong look had vanished\ninto the soft contour of her beautiful youth.\n\n\"Personally, I like you better when you've been drinking,\" he\nwent on.  \"You're sad when you're sober.  As you drink you\nliven up.\"\n\n\"When I get over being sad if I'm sober, when I learn to take\nthings as they come, just like a man--a strong man, then I'll\nbe----\" She stopped.\n\n\"Be what?\"\n\n\"Ready.\"\n\n\"Ready for what?\"\n\n\"How do I know?\"\n\nHe swung himself to a sitting position.  \"Meanwhile, you're\ncoming to live with me.  I've been fighting against it, but I\ngive up.  I need you.  You're the one I've been looking for.\nPack your traps.  I'll call a cab and we'll go over to my flat.\nThen we'll go to Rector's and celebrate.\"\n\nShe shook her head.  \"I'm sorry, but I can't.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I told you.  There's something in me that won't let me.\"\n\nHe rose, walked to her very deliberately.  He took one of her\nhands from her lap, drew her to her feet, put his hands\nstrongly on her shoulders.  \"You belong to me,\" he said, his\nlips smiling charmingly, but the devil in the gleam of his eyes\nand in the glistening of his beautiful, cruel teeth.  \"Pack up.\"\n\n\"You know that I won't.\"\n\nHe slowly crushed her in his arms, slowly pressed his lips upon\nhers.  A low scream issued from her lips and she seized him by\nthe throat with both hands, one hand over the other, and thrust\nhim backward.  He reeled, fell upon his back on the bed; she\nfell with him, clung to him--like a bull dog--not as if she\nwould not, but as if she could not, let go.  He clutched at her\nfingers; failing to dislodge them, he tried to thrust his\nthumbs into her eyes.  But she seized his right thumb between\nher teeth and bit into it until they almost met.  And at the\nsame time her knees ground into his abdomen.  He choked,\ngurgled, grew dark red, then gray, then a faint blackish blue,\nlay limp under her.  But she did not relax until the blue of\nhis face had deepened to black and his eyes began to bulge from\ntheir sockets.  At those signs that he was beyond doubt\nunconscious, she cautiously relaxed her fingers.  She\nunclenched her teeth; his arm, which had been held up by the\nthumb she was biting, dropped heavily.  She stood over him, her\neyes blazing insanely at him.  She snatched out her hatpin,\nflung his coat and waistcoat from over his chest, felt for his\nheart.  With the murderous eight inches of that slender steel\nponiard poised for the drive, she began to sob, flung the\nweapon away, took his face between her hands and kissed him.\n\n\"You fiend!  You fiend!\" she sobbed.\n\nShe changed to her plainest dress.  Leaving the blood-stained\nblouse on the bed beside him where she had flung it down after\ntearing it off, she turned out the light, darted down stairs\nand into the street.  At Times Square she took the Subway for\nthe Bowery.  To change one's world, one need not travel far in\nNew York; the ocean is not so wide as is the gap between the\nTenderloin and the lower East Side.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nSHE had thought of escape daily, hourly almost, for nearly five\nmonths.  She had advanced not an inch toward it; but she never\nfor an instant lost hope.  She believed in her destiny, felt\nwith all the strength of her health and vitality that she had\nnot yet found her place in the world, that she would find it,\nand that it would be high.  Now--she was compelled to escape,\nand this with only seventeen dollars and in the little time\nthat would elapse before Palmer returned to consciousness and\nstarted in pursuit, bent upon cruel and complete revenge.\nShe changed to an express train at the Grand Central Subway\nstation, left the express on impulse at Fourteenth Street, took\na local to Astor Place, there ascended to the street.\n\nShe was far indeed from the Tenderloin, in a region not visited\nby the people she knew.  As for Freddie, he never went below\nFourteenth Street, hated the lower East Side, avoided anyone\nfrom that region of his early days, now shrouded in a mystery\nthat would not be dispelled with his consent.  Freddie would\nnot think of searching for her there; and soon he would believe\nshe was dead--drowned, and at the bottom of river or bay.  As\nshe stepped from the exit of the underground, she saw in the\nsquare before her, under the Sunset Cox statue, a Salvation\nArmy corps holding a meeting.  She heard a cry from the center\nof the crowd:\n\n\"The wages of sin is death!\"\n\nShe drifted into the fringe of the crowd and glanced at the\nlittle group of exhorters and musicians.  The woman who was\npreaching had taken the life of the streets as her text.  Well\nfed and well clad and certain of a clean room to sleep\nin--certain of a good living, she was painting the moral\nhorrors of the street life.\n\n\"The wages of sin is death!\" she shouted.\n\nShe caught Susan's eye, saw the cynical-bitter smile round her\nlips.  For Susan had the feeling that, unsuspected by the upper\nclasses, animates the masses as to clergy and charity workers\nof all kinds--much the same feeling one would have toward the\nrobber's messenger who came bringing from his master as a\nloving gift some worthless trifle from the stolen goods.  Not\nfrom clergy, not from charity worker, not from the life of the\npoor as they take what is given them with hypocritical cringe\nand tear of thanks, will the upper classes get the truth as to\nwhat is thought of them by the masses in this day of awakening\nintelligence and slow heaving of crusts so long firm that they\nhave come to be regarded as bed-rock of social foundation.\n\nCried the woman, in response to Susan's satirical look:\n\n\"You mock at that, my lovely young sister.  Your lips are\npainted, and they sneer.  But you know I'm right--yes, you show\nin your eyes that you know it in your aching heart!  The wages\nof sin is _death!_  Isn't that so, sister?\"\n\nSusan shook her head.\n\n\"Speak the truth, sister!  God is watching you.  The wages of\nsin is _death!_\"\n\n\"The wages of weakness is death,\" retorted Susan.  \"But--the\nwages of sin--well, it's sometimes a house in Fifth Avenue.\"\n\nAnd then she shrank away before the approving laughter of the\nlittle crowd and hurried across into Eighth Street.  In the\ndeep shadow of the front of Cooper Union she paused, as the\nmeaning of her own impulsive words came to her.  The wages of\nsin!  And what was sin, the supreme sin, but weakness?  It was\nexactly as Burlingham had explained.  He had said that, whether\nfor good or for evil, really to live one must be strong.  Strong!\n\nWhat a good teacher he had been--one of the rare kind that not\nonly said things interestingly but also said them so that you\nnever forgot.  How badly she had learned!\n\nShe strolled on through Eighth Street, across Third Avenue and\ninto Second Avenue.  It was ten o'clock.  The effects of the\nliquor she had drunk had worn away.  In so much wandering she\nhad acquired the habit of closing up an episode of life as a\ntraveler puts behind him the railway journey at its end.  She\nwas less than half an hour from her life in the Tenderloin; it\nwas as completely in her past as it would ever be.  The cards\nhad once more been shuffled; a new deal was on.\n\nA new deal.  What?  To fly to another city--that meant another\nPalmer, or the miseries of the unprotected woman of the\nstreets, or slavery to the madman of what the French with cruel\nirony call a _maison de joie_.  To return to work----\n\nWhat was open to her, educated as the comfortable classes\neducate their women?  Work meant the tenements.  She loathed\nthe fast life, but not as she loathed vermin-infected\ntenements.  To toil all day at a monotonous task, the same task\nevery day and all day long!  To sleep at night with Tucker and\nthe vermin!  To her notion the sights and sounds and smells and\npersonal contacts of the tenements were no less vicious;\nwere--for her at least--far more degrading than anything in the\nTenderloin and its like.  And there she got money to buy\nwhiskey that whirled her almost endurably, sometimes even\ngayly, over the worst things--money to buy hours, whole days of\nrespite that could be spent in books, in dreams and plannings,\nin the freedom of a clean and comfortable room, or at the\ntheater or concert.  There were degrees in horror; she was\npaying a hateful price, but not so hateful as she had paid when\nshe worked.  The wages of shame were not so hard earned as the\nwages of toil, were larger, brought her many of the things she\ncraved.  The wages of toil brought her nothing but the right to\nbare existence in filth and depravity and darkness.  Also, she\nfelt that if she were tied down to some dull and exhausting\nemployment, she would be settled and done for.  In a few years\nshe would be an old woman, with less wages or flung out\ndiseased or maimed--to live on and on like hundreds of wretched\nold creatures adrift everywhere in the tenement streets.  No,\nwork had nothing to offer her except \"respectability.\"  And\nwhat a mocking was \"respectability,\" in rags and filth!\nBesides, what had _she_, the outcast born, to do with this\nrespectability?\n\nNo--not work--never again.  So long as she was roving about,\nthere was hope and chance somehow to break through into the\ntriumphant class that ruled the world, that did the things\nworth while--wore the good clothes, lived in the good houses,\nate the good food, basked in the sunshine of art.\n\nEither she would soar above respectability, or she would remain\nbeneath it.  Respectability might be an excellent thing; surely\nthere must be some merit in a thing about which there was so\nmuch talk, after which there was so much hankering, and to\nwhich there was such desperate clinging.  But as a sole\npossession, as a sole ambition, it seemed thin and poor and\neven pitiful.  She had emancipated herself from its tyranny;\nshe would not resume the yoke.  Among so many lacks of the good\nthings of life its good would not be missed.  Perhaps, when she\nhad got a few other of the good things she might try to add it\nto them--or might find herself able to get comfortably along\nwithout it, as had George Eliot and Aspasia, George Sand and\nDuse and Bernhardt and so many of the world's company of\nself-elected women members of the triumphant class.\n\nA new deal!  And a new deal meant at least even chance for good luck.\n\nAs she drifted down the west side of Second Avenue, her\nthoughts so absorbed her that she was oblivious of the slushy\nsidewalk, even of the crossings where one had to pick one's way\nas through a shallow creek with stepping stones here and there.\nThere were many women alone, as in every other avenue and every\nfrequented cross street throughout the city--women made eager\nto desperation by the long stretch of impossible weather.\nEvery passing man was hailed, sometimes boldly, sometimes\nsoftly.  Again and again that grotesque phrase \"Let's go have\na good time\" fell upon the ears.  After several blocks, when\nher absent-mindedness had got her legs wet to the knees in the\nshallow shiny slush, she was roused by the sound of music--an\norchestra playing and playing well a lively Hungarian dance.\nShe was standing before the winter garden from which the sounds\ncame.  As she opened the door she was greeted by a rush of warm\nair pleasantly scented with fresh tobacco smoke, the odors of\nspiced drinks and of food, pastry predominating.  Some of the\ntables were covered ready for those who would wish to eat; but\nmany of them were for the drinkers.  The large, low-ceilinged\nroom was comfortably filled.  There were but a few women and\nthey seemed to be wives or sweethearts.  Susan was about to\nretreat when a waiter--one of those Austrians whose heads end\nabruptly an inch or so above the eyebrows and whose chins soon\nshade off into neck--advanced smilingly with a polite, \"We\nserve ladies without escorts.\"\n\nShe chose a table that had several other vacant tables round\nit.  On the recommendation of the waiter she ordered a \"burning\ndevil\";  he assured her she would find it delicious and the\nvery thing for a cold slushy night.  At the far end of the room\non a low platform sat the orchestra.  A man in an evening suit\nmany sizes too large for him sang in a strong, not disagreeable\ntenor a German song that drew loud applause at the end of each\nstanza.  The \"burning devil\" came--an almost black mixture in\na large heavy glass.  The waiter touched a match to it, and it\nwas at once wreathed in pale flickering flames that hovered\nlike butterflies, now rising as if to float away, now lightly\ndescending to flit over the surface of the liquid or to dance\nalong the edge of the glass.\n\n\"What shall I do with it?\" said Susan.\n\n\"Wait till it goes out,\" said the waiter.  \"Then drink, as you\nwould anything else.\"  And he was off to attend to the wants of\na group of card players a few feet away.\n\nSusan touched her finger to the glass, when the flame suddenly\nvanished.  She found it was not too hot to drink, touched her\nlips to it.  The taste, sweetish, suggestive of coffee and of\nbrandy and of burnt sugar, was agreeable.  She slowly sipped\nit, delighting in the sensation of warmth, of comfort, of well\nbeing that speedily diffused through her.  The waiter came to\nreceive her thanks for his advice.  She said to him:\n\n\"Do you have women sing, too?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--when we can find a good-looker with a voice.  Our\ncustomers know music.\"\n\n\"I wonder if I could get a trial?\"\n\nThe waiter was interested at once.  \"Perhaps.  You sing?\"\n\n\"I have sung on the stage.\"\n\n\"I'll ask the boss.\"\n\nHe went to the counter near the door where stood a short\nthick-set Jew of the East European snub-nosed type in earnest\nconversation with a seated blonde woman.  She showed that skill\nat clinging to youth which among the lower middle and lower\nclasses pretty clearly indicates at least some experience at\nthe fast life.  For only in the upper and upper middle class\ndoes a respectable woman venture thus to advertise so\nsuspicious a guest within as a desire to be agreeable in the\nsight of men.  Susan watched the waiter as he spoke to the\nproprietor, saw the proprietor's impatient shake of the head,\nsent out a wave of gratitude from her heart when her waiter\nfriend persisted, compelled the proprietor to look toward her.\nShe affected an air of unconsciousness; in fact, she was posing\nas if before a camera.  Her heart leaped when out of the corner\nof her eye she saw the proprietor coming with the waiter.  The\ntwo paused at her table, and the proprietor said in a sharp,\nimpatient voice:\n\n\"Well, lady--what is it?\"\n\n\"I want a trial as a singer.\"\n\nThe proprietor was scanning her features and her figure which\nwas well displayed by the tight-fitting jacket.  The result\nseemed satisfactory, for in a voice oily with the softening\ninfluence of feminine charm upon male, he said:\n\n\"You've had experience?\"\n\n\"Yes--a lot of it.  But I haven't sung in about two years.\"\n\n\"Sing German?\"\n\n\"Only ballads in English.  But I can learn anything.\"\n\n\"English'll do--_if_ you can _sing_.  What costume do you wear?\"\nAnd the proprietor seated himself and motioned the waiter away.\n\n\"I have no costume.  As I told you, I've not been singing lately.\"\n\n\"We've got one that might fit--a short blue silk skirt--low\nneck and blue stockings.  Slippers too, but they might be\ntight--I forget the number.\"\n\n\"I did wear threes.  But I've done a great deal of walking.  I\nwear a five now.\"  Susan thrust out a foot and ankle, for she\nknew that despite the overshoe they were good to look at.\n\nThe proprietor nodded approvingly and there was the note of\npersonal interest in his voice as he said:  \"They can try your\nvoice tomorrow morning.  Come at ten o'clock.\"\n\n\"If you decide to try me, what pay will I get?\"\n\nThe proprietor smiled slyly.  \"Oh, we don't pay anything to the\nsingers.  That man who sang--he gets his board here.  He works\nin a factory as a bookkeeper in the daytime.  Lots of\ntheatrical and musical people come here.  If a man or a girl\ncan do any stunt worth while, there's a chance.\"\n\n\"I'd have to have something more than board,\" said Susan.\n\nThe proprietor frowned down at his stubby fingers whose black\nand cracked nails were drumming on the table.  \"Well--I might\ngive you a bed.  There's a place I could put one in my\ndaughter's room.  She sings and dances over at Louis Blanc's\ngarden in Third Avenue.  Yes, I could put you there.  But--no\nprivileges, you understand.\"\n\n\"Certainly. . . .  I'll decide tomorrow.  Maybe you'll not\nwant me.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--if you can sing at all.  Your looks'd please my\ncustomers.\"  Seeing the dubious expression in Susan's face, he\nwent on, \"When I say 'no privilege' I mean only about the room.\nOf course, it's none of my business what you do outside.  Lots\nof well fixed gents comes here.  My girls have all had good\nluck.  I've been open two years, and in that time one of my\nsingers got an elegant delicatessen owner to keep her.\"\n\n\"Really,\" said Susan, in the tone that was plainly expected of her.\n\n\"Yes--an _elegant_ gentleman.  I'd not be surprised if he\nmarried her.  And another married an electrician that cops out\nforty a week.  You'll find it a splendid chance to make nice\nfriends--good spenders.  And I'm a practical man.\"\n\n\"I suppose there isn't any work I could do in the daytime?\"\n\n\"Not here.\"\n\n\"Perhaps----\"\n\n\"Not nowhere, so far as I know.  That is, work you'd care to\ndo.  The factories and stores is hard on a woman, and she don't\nget much.  And besides they ain't very classy to my notion.  Of\ncourse, if a woman ain't got looks or sense or any tone to her,\nif she's satisfied to live in a bum tenement and marry some dub\nthat can't make nothing, why, that's different.  But you look\nlike a woman that had been used to something and wanted to get\nsomewhere.  I wouldn't have let _my_ daughter go into no such\nlow, foolish life.\"\n\nShe had intended to ask about a place to stop for the night.\nShe now decided that the suggestion that she was homeless might\npossibly impair her chances.  After some further\nconversation--the proprietor repeating what he had already\nsaid, and repeating it in about the same language--she paid the\nwaiter fifteen cents for the drink and a tip of five cents out\nof the change she had in her purse, and departed.  It had\nclouded over, and a misty, dismal rain was trickling through\nthe saturated air to add to the messiness of the churn of cold\nslush.  Susan went on down Second Avenue.  On a corner near its\nlower end she saw a Raines Law hotel with awnings, indicating\nthat it was not merely a blind to give a saloon a hotel license\nbut was actually open for business.  She went into the\n\"family\" entrance of the saloon, was alone in a small clean\nsitting-room with a sliding window between it and the bar.  A\ntough but not unpleasant young face appeared at the window.  It\nwas the bartender.\n\n\"Evening, cutie,\" said he.  \"What'll you have?\"\n\n\"Some rye whiskey,\" replied Susan.  \"May I smoke a cigarette here?\"\n\n\"Sure, go as far as you like.  Ten-cent whiskey--or fifteen?\"\n\n\"Fifteen--unless it's out of the same bottle as the ten.\"\n\n\"Call it ten--seeing as you are a lady.  I've got a soft heart\nfor you ladies.  I've got a wife in the business, myself.\"\n\nWhen he came in at the door with the drink, a young man\nfollowed him--a good-looking, darkish youth, well dressed in a\nready made suit of the best sort.  At second glance Susan saw\nthat he was at least partly of Jewish blood, enough to elevate\nhis face above the rather dull type which predominates among\nclerks and merchants of the Christian races.  He had small,\nshifty eyes, an attractive smile, a manner of assurance\nbordering on insolence.  He dropped into a chair at Susan's\ntable with a, \"You don't mind having a drink on me.\"\n\nAs Susan had no money to spare, she acquiesced.  She said to the\nbartender, \"I want to get a room here--a plain room.  How much?\"\n\n\"Maybe this gent'll help you out,\" said the bartender with a\ngrin and a wink.  \"He's got money to burn--and burns it.\"\n\nThe bartender withdrew.  The young man struck a match and held\nit for her to light the cigarette she took from her purse.\nThen he lit one himself.  \"Next time try one of mine,\" said he.\n\"I get 'em of a fellow that makes for the swellest uptown\nhouses.  But I get 'em ten cents a package instead of forty.\nI haven't seen you down here before.  What a good skin you've\ngot!  It's been a long time since I've seen a skin as fine as\nthat, except on a baby now and then.  And that shape of yours\nis all right, too.  I suppose it's the real goods?\"\n\nWith that he leaned across the table and put his hand upon her\nbosom.  She drew back indifferently.\n\n\"You don't give anything for nothing--eh?\" laughed he.  \"Been\nin the business long?\"\n\n\"It seems long.\"\n\n\"It ain't what it used to be.  The competition's getting to be\nsomething fierce.  Looks as if all the respectable girls and\nmost of the married women were coming out to look for a little\nextra money.  Well--why not?\"\n\nSusan shrugged her shoulders.  \"Why not?\" echoed she carelessly.\n\nShe did not look forward with pleasure to being alone.  The man\nwas clean and well dressed, and had an unusual amount of\npersonal charm that softened his impertinence of manner.\nEvidently he has the habit of success with women.  She much\npreferred him sitting with her to her own depressing society.\nSo she accepted his invitation.  She took one of his\ncigarettes, and it was as good as he had said.  He rattled on,\nmingling frank coarse compliments with talk about \"the\nbusiness\" from a standpoint so practical that she began to\nsuspect he was somehow in it himself.  He clearly belonged to\nthose more intelligent children of the upper class tenement\npeople, the children who are too bright and too well educated\nto become working men and working women like their parents; they\nrefuse to do any kind of manual labor, as it could never in the\nmost favorable circumstances pay well enough to give them the\nhigher comforts they crave, the expensive comforts which every\nmerchant is insistently and temptingly thrusting at a public\nfor the most part too poor to buy; so these cleverer children\nof the working class develop into shyster lawyers, politicians,\nsports, prostitutes, unless chance throws into their way some\nrespectable means of getting money.  Vaguely she\nwondered--without caring to question or guess what particular\nform of activity this young man had taken in avoiding\nmonotonous work at small pay.\n\nAfter her second drink came she found that she did not want it.\nShe felt tired and sleepy and wished to get her wet stockings\noff and to dry her skirt which, for all her careful holding up,\nhad not escaped the fate of whatever was exposed to that\nabominable night.  \"I'm going along with you,\" said the young\nman as she rose.  \"Here's to our better acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Thanks, but I want to be alone,\" replied she affably.  And,\nnot to seem unappreciative of his courtesy, she took a small\ndrink from her glass.  It tasted very queer.  She glanced\nsuspiciously at the young man.  Her legs grew suddenly and\nstrangely heavy.  Her heart began to beat violently, and a\nblack fog seemed to be closing in upon her eyes.  Through it\nshe saw the youth grinning sardonically.  And instantly she\nknew.  \"What a fool I am!\" she thought.\n\nShe had been trapped by another form of the slave system.  This\nman was a recruiting sergeant for houses of prostitution--was\none of the \"cadets.\"  They search the tenement districts for\ngood-looking girls and young women.  They hang about the street\ncorners, flirting.  They attend the balls where go the young\npeople of the lower middle class and upper lower class.  They\nlearn to make love seductively; they understand how to tempt a\ngirl's longing for finery, for an easier life, her dream of a\nhusband above her class in looks and in earning power.  And for\neach recruit \"broken in\" and hardened to the point of\nwillingness to go into a sporting house, they get from the\nproprietor ten to twenty-five dollars according to her youth\nand beauty.  Susan knew all about the system, had heard stories\nof it from the lips of girls who had been embarked through\nit--embarked a little sooner than they would have embarked\nunder the lash of want, or of that other and almost equally\ncompelling brute, desire for the comforts and luxuries that\nmean decent living.  Susan knew; yet here she was, because of\nan unguarded moment, and because of a sense of security through\nexperience--here she was, succumbing to knockout drops as easily\nas the most innocent child lured away from its mother's door to\nget a saucer of ice cream!  She tried to rise, to scream,\nthough she knew any such effort was futile.\n\nWith a gasp and a sigh her head fell forward and she was unconscious.\n\n\nShe awakened in a small, rather dingy room.  She was lying on\nher back with only stockings on.  Beyond the foot of the bed\nwas a little bureau at which a man, back full to her, stood in\ntrousers and shirt sleeves tying his necktie.  She saw that he\nwas a rough looking man, coarsely dressed--an artisan or small\nshop-keeper.  Used as she was to the profound indifference of\nmen of all classes and degrees of education and intelligence to\nwhat the woman thought--used as she was to this sensual\nselfishness which men at least in part conceal from their\nrespectable wives, Susan felt a horror of this man who had not\nminded her unconsciousness.  Her head was aching so fiercely\nthat she had not the courage to move.  Presently the man turned\ntoward her a kindly, bearded face.  But she was used to the man\nof general good character who with little shame and no\nhesitation became beast before her, the free woman.\n\n\"Hello, pretty!\" cried he, genially.  \"Slept off your jag, have you?\"\n\nHe was putting on his coat and waistcoat.  He took from the\nwaistcoat pocket a dollar bill.  \"You're a peach,\" said he.\n\"I'll come again, next time my old lady goes off guard.\"  He\nmade the bill into a pellet, dropped it on her breast.  \"A\nlittle present for you.  Put it in your stocking and don't let\nthe madam grab it.\"\n\nWith a groan Susan lifted herself to a sitting position, drew\nthe spread about her--a gesture of instinct rather than of\nconscious modesty.  \"They drugged me and brought me here,\" said\nshe.  \"I want you to help me get out.\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\" cried the man, instantly all a-quiver with\nnervousness.  \"I'm a married man.  I don't want to get mixed up\nin this.\"  And out of the room he bolted, closing the door\nbehind him.\n\nSusan smiled at herself satirically.  After all her experience,\nto make this silly appeal--she who knew men!  \"I must be\ngetting feeble-minded,\" thought she.  Then----\n\nHer clothes!  With a glance she swept the little room.  No\ncloset!  Her own clothes gone!  On the chair beside the bed\na fast-house parlor dress of pink cotton silk, and a kind of\nabbreviated chemise.  The stockings on her legs were not her\nown, but were of pink cotton, silk finished.  A pair of pink\nsatin slippers stood on the floor beside the two galvanized\niron wash basins.\n\nThe door opened and a burly man, dressed in cheap ready-made\nclothes but with an air of authority and prosperity, was\nsmiling at her.  \"The madam told me to walk right in and make\nmyself at home,\" said he.  \"Yes, you're up to her account of\nyou.  Only she said you were dead drunk and would probably be\nasleep.  Now, honey, you treat me right and I'll treat you right.\"\n\n\"Get out of here!\" cried Susan.  \"I'm going to leave this\nhouse.  They drugged me and brought me here.\"\n\n\"Oh, come now.  I've got nothing to do with your quarrels with\nthe landlady.  Cut those fairy tales out.  You treat me right\nand----\"\n\nA few minutes later in came the madam.  Susan, exhausted, sick,\nlay inert in the middle of the bed.  She fixed her gaze upon\nthe eyes looking through the hideous mask of paint and powder\npartially concealing the madam's face.\n\n\"Well, are you going to be a good girl now?\" said the madam.\n\n\"I want to sleep,\" said Susan.\n\n\"All right, my dear.\"  She saw and snatched the five-dollar\nbill from the pillow.  \"It'll go toward paying your board and\nfor the parlor dress.  God, but you was drunk when they brought\nyou up from the bar!\"\n\n\"When was that?\" asked Susan.\n\n\"About midnight.  It's nearly four now.  We've shut the house\nfor the night.  You're in a first-rate house, my dear, and if\nyou behave yourself, you'll make money--a lot more than you\never could at a dive like Zeist's.  If you don't behave well,\nwe'll teach you how.  This building belongs to one of the big\nmen in politics, and he looks after my interests--and he ought\nto, considering the rent I pay--five hundred a month--for the\nthree upper floors.  The bar's let separate.  Would you like a\nnice drink?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan.  Trapped!  Hopelessly trapped!  And she would\nnever escape until, diseased, her looks gone, ruined in body\nand soul, she was cast out into the hospital and the gutter.\n\n\"As I was saying,\" ventured the madam, \"you might as well\nsettle down quietly.\"\n\n\"I'm very well satisfied,\" said Susan.  \"I suppose you'll give\nme a square deal on what I make.\"  She laughed quietly as if\nsecretly amused at something.  \"In fact, I know you will,\" she\nadded in a tone of amused confidence.\n\n\"As soon as you've paid up your twenty-five a week for room and\nboard and the fifty for the parlor dress----\"\n\nSusan interrupted her with a laugh.  \"Oh, come off,\" said she.\n\"I'll not stand for that.  I'll go back to Jim Finnegan.\"\n\nThe old woman's eyes pounced for her face instantly.  \"Do you\nknow Finnegan?\"\n\n\"I'm his girl,\" said Susan carelessly.  She stretched herself\nand yawned.  \"I got mad at him and started out for some fun.\nHe's a regular damn fool about me.  But I'm sick of him.\nAnything but a jealous man!  And spied on everywhere I go.  How\nmuch can I make here?\"\n\n\"Ain't you from Zeist's?\" demanded the madam.  Her voice was\nquivering with fright.  She did not dare believe the girl; she\ndid not dare disbelieve her.\n\n\"Zeist's?  What's that?\" said Susan indifferently.\n\n\"The joint two blocks down.  Hasn't Joe Bishop had you in there\nfor a couple of months?\"\n\nSusan yawned.  \"Lord, how my head does ache!  Who's Joe Bishop?\nI'm dead to the world.  I must have had an awful jag!\"  She\nturned on her side, drew the spread over her.  \"I want to\nsleep.  So long!\"\n\n\"Didn't you run away from home with Joe Bishop?\" demanded the\nmadam shrilly.  \"And didn't he put you to work for Zeist?\"\n\n\"Who's Joe Bishop?  Where's Zeist's?\" Susan said, cross and yawning.\n\n\"I've been with Jim about a year.  He took me off the street.\nI was broke in five years ago.\"\n\nThe madam gave a kind of howl.  \"And that Joe Bishop got\ntwenty-five off me!\" she screamed.  \"And you're Finnegan's\ngirl, and he'll make trouble for me.\"\n\n\"He's got a nasty streak in him,\" said Susan, drowsily.  \"He\nput me on the Island once for a little side trip I made.\"  She\nlaughed, yawned.  \"But he sent and got me out in two days--and\ngave me a present of a hundred.  It's funny how a man'll make\na fool of himself about a woman.  Put out the light.\"\n\n\"No, I won't put out the light,\" shrieked the madam.  \"You\ncan't work here.  I'm going to telephone Jim Finnegan to come\nand get you.\"\n\nSusan started up angrily, as if she were half-crazed by drink.\n\"If you do, you old hag,\"  she cried, \"I'll tell him you doped\nme and set these men on me.  I'll tell him about Joe Bishop.\nAnd Jim'll send the whole bunch of you to the pen.  I'll not go\nback to him till I get good and ready.  And that means, I won't\ngo back at all, no matter what he offers me.\"  She began to cry\nin a maudlin way.  \"I hate him.  I'm tired of living as if I\nwas back in the convent.\"\n\nThe madam stood, heaving to and fro and blowing like a chained\nelephant.  \"I don't know what to do,\" she whined.  \"I wish Joe\nBishop was in hell.\"\n\n\"I'm going to get out of here,\" shrieked Susan, raving and\nblazing again and waving her arms.  \"You don't know a good\nthing when you get it.  What kind of a bum joint is this,\nanyway?  Where's my clothes?  They must be dry by this time.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes--they're dry, my dear,\" whined the madam.  \"I'll\nbring 'em to you.\"\n\nAnd out she waddled, returning in a moment with her arms full\nof the clothing.  She found Susan in the bed and nestling\ncomfortably into the pillows.  \"Here are your clothes,\" she cried.\n\n\"No--I want to sleep,\" was Susan's answer in a cross, drowsy\ntone.  \"I think I'll stay.  You won't telephone Jim.  But when\nhe finds me, I'll tell him to go to the devil.\"\n\n\"For God's sake!\" wailed the madam.  \"I can't let you work\nhere.  You don't want to ruin me, do you?\"\n\nSusan sat up, rubbed her eyes, yawned, brushed her hair back, put\na sly, smiling look into her face.  \"How much'll you give me to\ngo?\" she asked.  \"Where's the fifteen that was in my stocking?\"\n\n\"I've got it for you,\" said the madam.\n\n\"How much did I make tonight?\"\n\n\"There was three at five apiece.\"\n\nThree!--not only the two, but a third while she lay in a dead\nstupor.  Susan shivered.\n\n\"Your share's four dollars,\" continued the madam.\n\n\"Is that all!\" cried Susan, jeering.  \"A bum joint!  Oh,\nthere's my five the man gave me as a present.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes,\" quavered the madam.\n\n\"And another man gave me a dollar.\"  She looked round.  \"Where\nthe devil is it?\"  She found it in a fold of the spread.  \"Then\nyou owe me twenty altogether, counting the money I had on me.\"\nShe yawned.  \"I don't want to go!\" she protested, pausing\nhalfway in taking off the second pink stocking.  Then she\nlaughed.  \"Lord, what hell Jim will raise if he finds I spent\nthe night working in this house.  Why is it that, as soon as\nmen begin to care for a woman, they get prim about her?\"\n\n\"Do get dressed, dear,\" wheedled the madam.\n\n\"I don't see why I should go at this time of night,\" objected\nSusan pettishly.  \"What'll you give me if I go?\"\n\nThe madam uttered a groan.\n\n\"You say you paid Joe Bishop twenty-five----\"\n\n\"I'll kill him!\" shrieked the madam.  \"He's ruined me--ruined me!\"\n\n\"Oh, he's all right,\" said Susan cheerfully.  \"I like him.\nHe's a pretty little fellow.  I'll not give him away to Jim.\"\n\n\"Joe was dead stuck on you,\" cried the madam eagerly.  \"I\nmight 'a' knowed he hadn't seen you before.  I had to pay him\nthe twenty-five right away, to get him out of the house and let\nme put you to work.  He wanted to stay on.\"\n\nSusan shivered, laughed to hide it.  \"Well, I'll go for twenty-five.\"\n\n\"Twenty-five!\" shrieked the madam.\n\n\"You'll get it back from Joe.\"\n\n\"Maybe I won't.  He's a dog--a dirty dog.\"\n\n\"I think I told Joe about Jim,\" said Susan reflectively.  \"I\nwas awful gabby downstairs.  Yes--I told him.\"\n\nAnd her lowered eyes gleamed with satisfaction when the madam\ncried out:  \"You did!  And after that he brought you here!\nHe's got it in for me.  But I'll ruin him!  I'll tear him up!\"\n\nSusan dressed with the utmost deliberation, the madam urging\nher to make haste.  After some argument, Susan yielded to the\nmadam's pleadings and contented herself with the twenty\ndollars.  The madam herself escorted Susan down to the outside\ndoor and slathered her with sweetness and politeness.  The rain\nhad stopped again.  Susan went up Second Avenue slowly.  Two\nblocks from the dive from which she had escaped, she sank down\non a stoop and fainted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nTHE dash of cold rain drops upon her face and the chill of\nmoisture soaking through her clothing revived her.  Throughout\nthe whole range of life, whenever we resist we suffer.  As\nSusan dragged her aching, cold wet body up from that stoop, it\nseemed to her that each time she resisted the penalty grew\nheavier.  Could she have been more wretched had she remained in\nthat dive?  From her first rebellion that drove her out of her\nuncle's house had she ever bettered herself by resisting?  She\nhad gone from bad to worse, from worse to worst.\n\nWorst?  \"This _must_ be the worst!\" she thought.  \"Surely there\ncan be no lower depth than where I am now.\"  And then she\nshuddered and her soul reeled.  Had she not thought this at\neach shelf of the precipice down which she had been falling?\n\"Has it a bottom?  Is there no bottom?\"\n\nWet through, tired through, she put up her umbrella and forced\nherself feebly along.  \"Where am I going?  Why do I not kill\nmyself?  What is it that drives me on and on?\"\n\nThere came no direct answer to that last question.  But up from\nthose deep vast reservoirs of vitality that seemed sufficient\nwhatever the drain upon them--up from those reservoirs welled\nstrength and that unfaltering will to live which breathes upon\nthe corpse of hope and quickens it.  And she had a sense of an\ninvisible being, a power that had her in charge, a destiny,\nwalking beside her, holding up her drooping strength, compelling\nher toward some goal hidden in the fog and the storm.\n\nAt Eighth Street she turned west; at Third Avenue she paused,\nwaiting for chance to direct her.  Was it not like the\nmaliciousness of fate that in the city whose rarely interrupted\nreign of joyous sunshine made her call it the city of the Sun\nher critical turn of chance should have fallen in foul weather?\nEvidently fate was resolved on a thorough test of her\nendurance.  In the open square, near the Peter Cooper statue,\nstood a huge all-night lunch wagon.  She moved toward it, for\nshe suddenly felt hungry.  It was drawn to the curb; a short\nflight of ladder steps led to an interior attractive to sight\nand smell.  She halted at the foot of the steps and looked in.\nThe only occupant was the man in charge.  In a white coat he\nwas leaning upon the counter, reading a newspaper which lay\nflat upon it.  His bent head was extensively and roughly\nthatched with black hair so thick that to draw a comb through\nit would have been all but impossible.  As Susan let down her\numbrella and began to ascend, he lifted his head and gave her\na full view of a humorous young face, bushy of eyebrows and\nmustache and darkly stained by his beard, close shaven though\nit was.  He looked like a Spaniard or an Italian, but he was a\nblack Irishman, one of the West coasters who recall in their\neyes and coloring the wrecking of the Armada.\n\n\"Good morning, lady,\" said he.  \"Breakfast or supper?\"\n\n\"Both,\" replied Susan.  \"I'm starved.\"\n\nThe air was gratefully warm in the little restaurant on wheels.\nThe dominant odor was of hot coffee; but that aroma was carried\nto a still higher delight by a suggestion of pastry.  \"The best\nthing I've got,\" said the restaurant man, \"is hot corn beef\nhash.  It's so good I hate to let any of it go.  You can have\ngriddle cakes, too--and coffee, of course.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Susan.\n\nShe was ascending upon a wave of reaction from the events of\nthe night.  Her headache had gone.  The rain beating upon the\nroof seemed musical to her now, in this warm shelter with its\ncertainty of the food she craved.\n\nThe young man was busy at the shiny, compact stove; the odors\nof the good things she was presently to have grew stronger and\nstronger, stimulating her hunger, bringing joy to her heart and\na smile to her eyes.  She wondered at herself.  After what she\nhad passed through, how could she feel thus happy--yes,\npositively happy?  It seemed to her this was an indication of\na lack in her somewhere--of seriousness, of sensibility, of she\nknew not what.  She ought to be ashamed of that lack.  But she\nwas not ashamed.  She was shedding her troubles like a\nchild--or like a philosopher.\n\n\"Do you like hash?\" inquired the restaurant man over his shoulder.\n\n\"Just as you're making it,\" said she.  \"Dry but not too dry.\nBrown but not too brown.\"\n\n\"You don't think you'd like a poached egg on top of it?\"\n\n\"Exactly what I want!\"\n\n\"It isn't everybody that can poach an egg,\" said the restaurant\nman.  \"And it isn't every egg that can be poached.  Now, my\neggs are the real thing.  And I can poach 'em so you'd think\nthey was done with one of them poaching machines.  I don't have\n'em with the yellow on a slab of white.  I do it so that the\nwhite's all round the yellow, like in the shell.  And I keep\n'em tender, too.  Did you say one egg or a pair?\"\n\n\"Two,\" said Susan.\n\nThe dishes were thick, but clean and whole.  The hash--\"dry but\nnot too dry, brown but not too brown\"--was artistically\narranged on its platter, and the two eggs that adorned its top\nwere precisely as he had promised.  The coffee, boiled with the\nmilk, was real coffee, too.  When the restaurant man had set\nthese things before her, as she sat expectant on a stool, he\nviewed his handiwork with admiring eyes.\n\n\"Delmonico couldn't beat it,\" said he.  \"No, nor Oscar,\nneither.  That'll take the tired look out of your face, lady,\nand bring the beauty back.\"\n\nSusan ate slowly, listening to the music of the beating rain.\nIt was like an oasis, a restful halt between two stretches of\ndesert journey; she wished to make it as long as possible.\nOnly those who live exposed to life's buffetings ever learn to\nenjoy to the full the great little pleasures of life--the\nhalcyon pauses in the storms--the few bright rays through the\nbreak in the clouds, the joy of food after hunger, of a bath\nafter days of privation, of a jest or a smiling face or a kind\nword or deed after darkness and bitterness and contempt.  She saw\nthe restaurant man's eyes on her, a curious expression in them.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" she inquired.\n\n\"I was thinking,\" said he, \"how miserable you must have been to\nbe so happy now.\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess none of us has any too easy a time,\" said she.\n\n\"But it's mighty hard on women.  I used to think different,\nbefore I had bad luck and got down to tending this lunch wagon.\nBut now I understand about a lot of things.  It's all very well\nfor comfortable people to talk about what a man or a woman\nought to do and oughtn't to do.  But let 'em be slammed up\nagainst it.  They'd sing a different song--wouldn't they?\"\n\n\"Quite different,\" said Susan.\n\nThe man waved a griddle spoon.  \"I tell you, we do what we've\ngot to do.  Yes--the thieves and--and--all of us.  Some's used\nfor foundations and some for roofing and some for inside fancy\nwork and some for outside wall.  And some's used for the\nrubbish heap.  But all's used.  They do what they've got to do.\nI was a great hand at worrying what I was going to be used for.\nBut I don't bother about it any more.\"  He began to pour the\ngriddle cake dough.  \"I think I'll get there, though,\" said he\ndoggedly, as if he expected to be derided for vanity.\n\n\"You will,\" said Susan.\n\n\"I'm twenty-nine.  But I've been being got ready for something.\nThey don't chip away at a stone as they have at me without\nintending to make some use of it.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said the girl, hope and faith welling up in her\nown heart.\n\n\"And what's more, I've stood the chipping.  I ain't become\nrubbish; I'm still a good stone.  That's promising, ain't it?\"\n\n\"It's a sure sign,\" declared Susan.  Sure for herself, no less\nthan for him.\n\nThe restaurant man took from under the counter several\nwell-worn schoolbooks.  He held them up, looked at Susan and\nwinked.  \"Good business--eh?\"\n\nShe laughed and nodded.  He put the books back under the\ncounter, finished the cakes and served them.  As he gave her\nmore butter he said:\n\n\"It ain't the best butter--not by a long shot.  But it's\ngood--as good as you get on the average farm--or better.  Did\nyou ever eat the best butter?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  I've had some that was very good.\"\n\n\"Eighty cents a pound?\"\n\n\"Mercy, no,\" exclaimed Susan.\n\n\"Awful price, isn't it?  But worth the money--yes, sir!  Some\ntime when you've got a little change to spare, go get half a\npound at one of the swell groceries or dairies.  And the best\nmilk, too.  Twelve cents a quart.  Wait till I get money.  I'll\nshow 'em how to live.  I was born in a tenement.  Never had\nnothing.  Rags to wear, and food one notch above a garbage\nbarrel.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Susan.\n\n\"But even as a boy I wanted the high-class things.  It's\nwanting the best that makes a man push his way up.\"\n\nAnother customer came--a keeper of a butcher shop, on his way\nto market.  Susan finished the cakes, paid the forty cents and\nprepared to depart.  \"I'm looking for a hotel,\" said she to the\nrestaurant man, \"one where they'll take me in at this time, but\none that's safe not a dive.\"\n\n\"Right across the square there's a Salvation Army shelter--very\ngood--clean.  I Don't know of any other place for a lady.\"\n\n\"There's a hotel on the next corner,\" put in the butcher,\nsuspending the violent smacking and sipping which attended his\ntaking rolls and coffee.  \"It ain't neither the one thing nor\nthe other.  It's clean and cheap, and they'll let you behave if\nyou want to.\"\n\n\"That's all I ask,\" said the girl.  \"Thank you.\"  And she\ndeparted, after an exchange of friendly glances with the\nrestaurant man.  \"I feel lots better,\" said she.\n\n\"It was a good breakfast,\" replied he.\n\n\"That was only part.  Good luck!\"\n\n\"Same to you, lady.  Call again.  Try my chops.\"\n\nAt the corner the butcher had indicated Susan found the usual\nRaines Law hotel, adjunct to a saloon and open to all comers,\nhowever \"transient.\"  But she took the butcher's word for it,\nengaged a dollar-and-a-half room from the half-asleep clerk,\nwas shown to it by a colored bellboy who did not bother to wake\nup.  It was a nice little room with barely space enough for a\nbed, a bureau, a stationary washstand, a chair and a small\nradiator.  As she undressed by the light of a sad gray dawn,\nshe examined her dress to see how far it needed repair and how\nfar it might be repaired.  She had worn away from Forty-third\nStreet her cheapest dress because it happened to be of an\ninconspicuous blue.  It was one of those suits that look fairly\nwell at a glance on the wax figure in the department store\nwindow, that lose their bloom as quickly as a country bride,\nand at the fourth or fifth wearing begin to make frank and\nsweeping confession of the cheapness of every bit of the\nmaterial and labor that went into them.  These suits are\ntypical of all that poverty compels upon the poor, all that\nthey in their ignorance and inexperience of values accept\nwithout complaint, fancying they are getting money's worth and\nnever dreaming they are more extravagant than the most prodigal\nof the rich.  However, as their poverty gives them no choice,\ntheir ignorance saves them from futilities of angry discontent.\nSusan had bought this dress because she had to have another\ndress and could not afford to spend more than twelve dollars,\nand it had been marked down from twenty-five.  She had worn it\nin fair weather and had contrived to keep it looking pretty\nwell.  But this rain had finished it quite.  Thereafter, until\nshe could get another dress, she must expect to be classed as\npoor and seedy--therefore, on the way toward deeper\npoverty--therefore, an object of pity and of prey.  If she went\ninto a shop, she would be treated insultingly by the shopgirls,\ndespising her as a poor creature like themselves.  If a man\napproached her, he would calculate upon getting her very cheap\nbecause a girl in such a costume could not have been in the\nhabit of receiving any great sum.  And if she went with him, he\nwould treat her with far less consideration than if she had\nbeen about the same business in smarter attire.  She spread the\ndress on bureau and chair, smoothing it, wiping the mud stains\nfrom it.  She washed out her stockings at the stationary stand,\ngot them as dry as her remarkably strong hands could wring\nthem, hung them on a rung of the chair near the hot little\nradiator.  She cleaned her boots and overshoes with an old\nnewspaper she found in a drawer, and wet at the washstand.  She\ntook her hat to pieces and made it over into something that\nlooked almost fresh enough to be new.  Then, ready for bed, she\ngot the office of the hotel on the telephone and left a call\nfor half-past nine o'clock--three hours and a half away.  When\nshe was throwing up the window, she glanced into the street.\n\nThe rain had once more ceased.  Through the gray dimness the\nmen and women, boys and girls, on the way to the factories and\nshops for the day's work, were streaming past in funereal\nprocession.  Some of the young ones were lively.  But the mass\nwas sullen and dreary.  Bodies wrecked or rapidly wrecking by\nignorance of hygiene, by the foul air and foul food of the\ntenements, by the monotonous toil of factory and shop--mindless\ntoil--toil that took away mind and put in its place a distaste\nfor all improvement--toil of the factories that distorted the\nbody and enveloped the soul in sodden stupidity--toil of the\nshops that meant breathing bad air all day long, meant stooped\nshoulders and varicose veins in the legs and the arches of the\ninsteps broken down, meant dull eyes, bad skin, female\ncomplaints, meant the breeding of desires for the luxury the\nshops display, the breeding of envy and servility toward those\nable to buy these luxuries.\n\nSusan lingered, fascinated by this exhibit of the price to the\nmany of civilization for the few.  Work?  Never!  Not any more\nthan she would.  \"Work\" in a dive!  Work--either branch of it,\nfactory and shop or dive meant the sale of all the body and all\nthe soul; her profession--at least as she practiced it--meant\nthat perhaps she could buy with part of body and part of soul\nthe privilege of keeping the rest of both for her own self.  If\nshe had stayed on at work from the beginning in Cincinnati,\nwhere would she be now?  Living in some stinking tenement hole,\nwith hope dead.  And how would she be looking?  As dull of eye\nas the rest, as pasty and mottled of skin, as ready for any\nchance disease.  Work?  Never!  Never!  \"Not at anything that'd\ndegrade me more than this life.  Yes--more.\"  And she lifted\nher head defiantly.  To her hunger Life was thus far offering\nonly a plate of rotten apples; it was difficult to choose among\nthem--but there was choice.\n\nShe was awakened by the telephone bell; and it kept on ringing\nuntil she got up and spoke to the office through the sender.\nNever had she so craved sleep; and her mental and physical\ncontentment of three hours and a half before had been succeeded\nby headache, a general soreness, a horrible attack of the\nblues.  She grew somewhat better, however, as she washed first\nin hot water, then in cold at the stationary stand which was\nquite as efficient if not so luxurious as a bathtub.  She\ndressed in a rush, but not so hurriedly that she failed to make\nthe best toilet the circumstances permitted.  Her hair went up\nunusually well; the dress did not look so badly as she had\nfeared it would.  \"As it's a nasty day,\" she reflected, \"it won't\ndo me so much damage.  My hat and my boots will make them give\nme the benefit of the doubt and think I'm saving my good clothes.\"\n\nShe passed through the office at five minutes to ten.  When she\nreached Lange's winter garden, its clock said ten minutes past\nten, but she knew it must be fast.  Only one of the four\nmusicians had arrived--the man who played the drums, cymbals,\ntriangle and xylophone--a fat, discouraged old man who knew how\neasily he could be replaced.  Neither Lange nor his wife had\ncome; her original friend, the Austrian waiter, was wiping off\ntables and cleaning match stands.  He welcomed her with a smile\nof delight that showed how few teeth remained in the front of\nhis mouth and how deeply yellow they were.  But Susan saw only\nhis eyes--and the kind heart that looked through them.\n\n\"Maybe you haven't had breakfast already?\" he suggested.\n\n\"I'm not hungry, thank you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps some coffee--yes?\"\n\nSusan thought the coffee would make her feel better.  So he\nbrought it--Vienna fashion--an open china pot full of strong,\ndeliciously aromatic black coffee, a jug of milk with whipped\nwhite of egg on top, a basket of small sweet rolls powdered\nwith sugar and caraway seed.  She ate one of the rolls, drank\nthe coffee.  Before she had finished, the waiter stood beaming\nbefore her and said:\n\n\"A cigarette--yes?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" replied Susan, a little sadly.\n\n\"But yes,\" urged he.  \"It isn't against the rules.  The boss's\nwife smokes.  Many ladies who come here do--real ladies.  It is\nthe custom in Europe.  Why not?\" And he produced a box of\ncigarettes and put it on the table.  Susan lit one of them and\nonce more with supreme physical content came a cheerfulness\nthat put color and sprightliness into the flowers of hope.  And\nthe sun had won its battle with the storm; the storm was in\nretreat.  Sunshine was streaming in at the windows, into her\nheart.  The waiter paused in his work now and then to enjoy\nhimself in contemplating the charming picture she made.  She\nwas thinking of what the wagon restaurant man had said.  Yes,\nLife had been chipping away at her; but she had remained good\nstone, had not become rubbish.\n\nAbout half-past ten Lange came down from his flat which was\noverhead.  He inspected her by daylight and finding that his\nelectric light impressions were not delusion was highly pleased\nwith her.  He refused to allow her to pay for the coffee.\n\"Johann!\" he called, and the leader of the orchestra approached\nand made a respectful bow to his employer.  He had a solemn\npompous air and the usual pompadour.  He and Susan plunged into\nthe music question, found that the only song they both knew was\nTosti's \"Good Bye.\"\n\n\"That'll do to try,\" said Lange.  \"Begin!\"\n\nAnd after a little tuning and voice testing, Susan sang the\n\"Good Bye\" with full orchestra accompaniment.  It was not good;\nit was not even pretty good; but it was not bad.  \"You'll do\nall right,\" said Lange.  \"You can stay.  Now, you and Johann\nfix up some songs and get ready for tonight.\"  And he turned\naway to buy supplies for restaurant and bar.\n\nJohann, deeply sentimental by nature, was much pleased with\nSusan's contralto.  \"You do not know how to sing,\" said he.\n\"You sing in your throat and you've got all the faults of\nparlor singers.  But the voice is there--and much\nexpressiveness--much temperament.  Also, you have\nintelligence--and that will make a very little voice\ngo a great way.\"\n\nBefore proceeding any further with the rehearsal, he took Susan\nup to a shop where sheet music was sold and they selected three\nsimple songs:  \"Gipsy Queen,\" \"Star of My Life\" and \"Love in\nDreams.\"  They were to try \"Gipsy Queen\" that night, with \"Good\nBye\" and, if the applause should compel, \"Suwanee River.\"\n\nWhen they were back at the restaurant Susan seated herself in\na quiet corner and proceeded to learn the words of the song and\nto get some notion of the tune.\n\nShe had lunch with Mr. and Mrs. Lange and Katy, whose hair was\nvery golden indeed and whose voice and manner proclaimed the\nBowery and its vaudeville stage.  She began by being grand with\nSusan, but had far too good a heart and far too sensible a\nnature to keep up long.  It takes more vanity, more solemn\nstupidity and more leisure than plain people have time for, to\nmaintain the force of fake dignity.  Before lunch was over it\nwas Katy and Lorna; and Katy was distressed that her duties at\nthe theater made it impossible for her to stay and help Lorna\nwith the song.\n\nAt the afternoon rehearsal Susan distinguished herself.  To\npermit business in the restaurant and the rehearsal at the same\ntime, there was a curtain to divide the big room into two\nunequal parts.  When Susan sang her song through for the first\ntime complete, the men smoking and drinking on the other side\nof the curtain burst into applause.  Johann shook hands with\nSusan, shook hands again, kissed her hand, patted her shoulder.\nBut in the evening things did not go so well.\n\nSusan, badly frightened, got away from the orchestra, lagged\nwhen it speeded to catch up with her.  She made a pretty and\nengaging figure in the costume, low in the neck and ending at\nthe knees.  Her face and shoulders, her arms and legs, the\nlines of her slender, rounded body made a success.  But they\nbarely saved her from being laughed at.  When she finished,\nthere was no applause so no necessity for an encore.  She ran\nupstairs, and, with nerves all a-quiver, hid herself in the\nlittle room she and Katy were to share.  Until she failed she\ndid not realize how much she had staked upon this venture.  But\nnow she knew; and it seemed to her that her only future was the\nstreets.  Again her chance had come; again she had thrown it\naway.  If there were anything in her--anything but mere vain\nhopes--that could not have occurred.  In her plight anyone with\na spark of the divinity that achieves success would have\nscored.  \"I belong in the streets,\" said she.  Before dinner\nshe had gone out and had bought a ninety-five cent night-dress\nand some toilet articles.  These she now bundled together again.\nShe changed to her street dress; she stole down the stairs.\n\nShe was out at the side door, she was flying through the side\nstreet toward the Bowery.  \"Hi!\" shouted someone behind her.\n\"Where you going?\"  And overtaking her came her staunch friend\nAlbert, the waiter.  Feeling that she must need sympathy and\nencouragement, he had slipped away from his duties to go up to\nher.  He had reached the hall in time to see what she was about\nand had darted bareheaded after her.\n\n\"Where you going?\" he repeated, excitedly.\n\nA crowd began to gather.  \"Oh, good-by,\" she cried.  \"I'm\ngetting out before I'm told to go--that's all.  I made a\nfailure.  Thank you, Albert.\"  She put out her hand; she was\nstill moving and looking in the direction of the Bowery.\n\n\"Now you mustn't be foolish,\", said he, holding on tightly to her\nhand.  \"The boss says it's all right.  Tomorrow you do better.\"\n\n\"I'd never dare try again.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow makes everything all right.  You mustn't act like a\nbaby.  The first time Katy tried, they yelled her off the\nstage.  Now she gets eleven a week.  Come back right away with\nme.  The boss'd be mad if you won't.  You ain't acting right,\nMiss Lorna.  I didn't think you was such a fool.\"\n\nHe had her attention now.  Unmindful of the little crowd they\nhad gathered, they stood there discussing until to save Albert\nfrom pneumonia she returned with him.  He saw her started up\nthe stairs, then ventured to take his eye off her long enough\nto put his head into the winter garden and send a waiter for\nLange.  He stood guard until Lange came and was on his way to her.\n\nThe next evening, a Saturday, before a crowded house she sang\nwell, as well as she had ever sung in her life--sang well enough\nto give her beauty of face and figure, her sweetness, her charm\nthe opportunity to win a success.  She had to come back and\nsing \"Suwanee River.\"  She had to come for a second encore;\nand, flushed with her victory over her timidity, she sang\nTosti's sad cry of everlasting farewell with all the tenderness\nthere was in her.  That song exactly fitted her passionate,\nmelancholy voice; its words harmonized with the deep sadness\nthat was her real self, that is the real self of every\nsensitive soul this world has ever tried with its exquisite\ntorments for flesh and spirit.  The tears that cannot be shed\nwere in her voice, in her face, as she stood there, with her\nviolet-gray eyes straining into vacancy.  But the men and the\nwomen shed tears; and when she moved, breaking the spell of\nsilence, they not only applauded, they cheered.\n\nThe news quickly spread that at Lange's there was a girl singer\nworth hearing and still more worth looking at.  And Lange had\nhis opportunity to arrive.\n\nBut several things stood in his way, things a man of far more\nintelligence would have found it hard to overcome.\n\nLike nearly all saloon-keepers, he was serf to a brewery; and\nthe particular brewery whose beer his mortgage compelled\nhim to push did not make a beer that could be pushed.  People\ncomplained that it had a disagreeably bitter aftertaste.  In\nthe second place, Mrs. Lange was a born sitter.  She had\nmarried to rest--and she was resting.  She was always piled\nupon a chair.  Thus, she was not an aid but a hindrance, an\nencourager of the help in laziness and slovenliness.  Again,\nthe cooking was distinctly bad; the only really good thing the\nhouse served was coffee, and that was good only in the\nmornings.  Finally, Lange was a saver by nature and not a\nspreader.  He could hold tightly to any money he closed his\nstubby fingers upon; he did not know how to plant money and\nmake it grow, but only how to hoard.\n\nThus it came to pass that, after the first spurt, the business\nfell back to about where it had been before Susan came.\nAlbert, the Austrian waiter, explained to Susan why it was that\nher popularity did the house apparently so little\ngood--explained with truth where she suspected kind-hearted\nplotting, that she had arrested its latterly swift-downward\nslide.  She was glad to hear what he had to say, as it was most\npleasant to her vanity; but she could not get over the\ndepression of the central fact--she was not making the sort of\nbusiness to justify asking Lange for more than board and lodging;\nshe was not in the way of making the money that was each\nday more necessary, as her little store dwindled.\n\nThe question of getting money to live on is usually dismissed\nin a princely way by writers about human life.  It is in\nreality, except with the few rich, the ever-present\nquestion--as ever-present as the necessity of breathing--and it\nis not, like breathing, a matter settled automatically.  It\ndominates thought; it determines action.  To leave it out of\naccount ever, in writing a human history, is to misrepresent\nand distort as utterly as would a portrait painter who\nneglected to give his subject eyes, or a head, even.  With the\noverwhelming mass of us, money is at all times all our lives\nlong the paramount question--for to be without it is\ndestruction worse than death, and we are almost all perilously\nnear to being without it.  Thus, airily to pass judgment upon\nmen and women as to their doings in getting money for\nnecessaries, for what the compulsion of custom and habit has\nmade necessaries to them--airily to judge them for their doings\nin such dire straits is like sitting calmly on shore and\ncriticizing the conduct of passengers and sailors in a\nstorm-beset sinking ship.  It is one of the favorite pastimes of\nthe comfortable classes; it makes an excellent impression as to\none's virtue upon one's audience; it gives us a pleasing sense\nof superior delicacy and humor.  But it is none the less mean\nand ridiculous.  Instead of condemnation, the world needs to\nbestir itself to remove the stupid and cruel creatures that\nmake evil conduct necessary; for can anyone, not a prig, say\nthat the small part of the human race that does well does so\nbecause it is naturally better than the large part that does ill?\n\nSpring was slow in opening.  Susan's one dress was in a\ndeplorable state.  The lining hung in rags.  The never good\nmaterial was stretched out of shape, was frayed and worn gray\nin spots, was beyond being made up as presentable by the most\ncareful pressing and cleaning.  She had been forced to buy a\nhat, shoes, underclothes.  She had only three dollars and a few\ncents left, and she simply did not dare lay it all out in dress\nmaterials.  Yet, less than all would not be enough; all would\nnot be enough.\n\nLange had from time to time more than hinted at the\nopportunities she was having as a public singer in his hall.\nBut Susan, for all her experience, had remained one of those\nupon whom such opportunities must be thrust if they are to be\naccepted.\n\nSo long as she had food and shelter, she could not make\nadvances; she could not even go so far as passive acquiescence.\nShe knew she was again violating the fundamental canon of\nsuccess; whatever one's business, do it thoroughly if at all.\nBut she could not overcome her temperament which had at this\nfeeble and false opportunity at once resented itself.  She knew\nperfectly that therein was the whole cause of her failure to\nmake the success she ought to have made when she came up from\nthe tenements, and again when she fell into the clutches of\nFreddie Palmer.  But it is one thing to know; it is another\nthing to do.  Susan ignored the attempts of the men; she\npretended not to understand Lange when they set him on to\nintercede with her for them.  She saw that she was once more\ndrifting to disaster--and that she had not long to drift.  She\nwas exasperated against herself; she was disgusted with\nherself.  But she drifted on.\n\nGrowing seedier looking every day, she waited, defying the\nplain teachings of experience.  She even thought seriously of\ngoing to work.  But the situation in that direction remained\nunchanged.  She was seeing things, the reasons for things, more\nclearly now, as experience developed her mind.  She felt that\nto get on in respectability she ought to have been either more\nor less educated.  If she had been used from birth to\nconditions but a step removed from savagery, she might have\nbeen content with what offered, might even have felt that she\nwas rising.  Or if she had been bred to a good trade, and\neducated only to the point where her small earnings could have\nsatisfied her desires, then she might have got along in\nrespectability.  But she had been bred a \"lady\"; a Chinese\nwoman whose feet have been bound from babyhood until her\nfifteenth or sixteenth year--how long it would be, after her\nfeet were freed, before she could learn to walk at all!--and\nwould she ever be able to learn to walk well?\n\nWhat is luxury for one is squalor for another; what is\nelevation for one degrades another.  In respectability she\ncould not earn what was barest necessity for her--what she was\nnow getting at Lange's--decent shelter, passable food.  Ejected\nfrom her own class that shelters its women and brings them up\nin unfitness for the unsheltered life, she was dropping as all\nsuch women must and do drop--was going down, down,\ndown--striking on this ledge and that, and rebounding to resume\nher ever downward course.\n\nShe saw her own plight only too vividly.  Those whose outward\nand inward lives are wide apart get a strong sense of dual\npersonality.  It was thus with Susan.  There were times when\nshe could not believe in the reality of her external life.\n\nShe often glanced through the columns on columns, pages on\npages of \"want ads\" in the papers--not with the idea of\nanswering them, for she had served her apprenticeship at that,\nbut simply to force herself to realize vividly just how matters\nstood with her.  Those columns and pages of closely printed\nofferings of work!  Dreary tasks, all of them--tasks devoid of\ninterest, of personal sense of usefulness, tasks simply to keep\ndegrading soul in degenerating body, tasks performed in filthy\nfactories, in foul-smelling workrooms and shops, in unhealthful\nsurroundings.  And this, throughout civilization, was the\n\"honest work\" so praised--by all who don't do it, but live\npleasantly by making others do it.  Wasn't there something in\nthe ideas of Etta's father, old Tom Brashear?  Couldn't\nsensible, really loving people devise some way of making most\ntasks less repulsive, of lessening the burdens of those tasks\nthat couldn't be anything but repulsive?  Was this stupid\nsystem, so cruel, so crushing, and producing at the top such\nabsurd results as flashy, insolent autos and silly palaces and\noverfed, overdressed women, and dogs in jeweled collars, and\nbabies of wealth brought up by low menials--was this system\nreally the best?\n\n\"If they'd stop canting about 'honest work' they might begin to\nget somewhere.\"\n\nIn the effort to prevent her downward drop from beginning again\nshe searched all the occupations open to her.  She could not\nfind one that would not have meant only the most visionary\nprospect of some slight remote advancement, and the certain and\nspeedy destruction of what she now realized was her chief asset\nand hope--her personal appearance.  And she resolved that she\nwould not even endanger it ever again.  The largest part of the\nlittle capital she took away from Forty-third Street had gone\nto a dentist who put in several fillings of her back teeth.\nShe had learned to value every charm--hair, teeth, eyes, skin,\nfigure, hands.  She watched over them all, because she felt\nthat when her day finally came--and come it would, she never\nallowed long to doubt--she must be ready to enter fully into\nher own.  Her day!  The day when fate should change the life her\noutward self would be compelled to live, would bring it into\nharmony with the life of inward self--the self she could control.\n\nKaty had struck up a friendship at once profitable and\nsentimental with her stage manager.  She often stayed out all\nnight.  On one of these nights Susan, alone in the tiny room\nand asleep, was roused by feeling hands upon her.  She started\nup half awake and screamed.\n\n\"Sh!\" came in Lange's voice.  \"It's me.\"\n\nSusan had latterly observed sly attempts on his part to make\nadvances without his wife and daughter's suspecting; but she\nhad thought her way of quietly ignoring was effective.  \"You\nmust go,\" she whispered.  \"Mrs. Lange must have heard.\"\n\n\"I had to come,\" said he hoarsely, a mere voice in the\ndarkness.  \"I can't hold out no longer without you, Lorna.\"\n\n\"Go--go,\" urged Susan.\n\nBut it was too late.  In the doorway, candle in hand, appeared\nMrs. Lange.  Despite her efforts at \"dressiness\" she was in her\nbest hour homely and nearly shapeless.  In night dress and\nreleased from corsets she was hideous and monstrous.  \"I\nthought so!\" she shrieked.  \"I thought so!\"\n\n\"I heard a burglar, mother,\" whined Lange, an abject and\nguilty figure.\n\n\"Shut your mouth, you loafer!\" shrieked Mrs. Lange.  And she\nturned to Susan.  \"You gutter hussy, get on your clothes and\nclear out!\"\n\n\"But--Mrs. Lange----\" began Susan.\n\n\"Clear out!\" she shouted, opening the outer hall.  \"Dress\nmighty damn quick and clear out!\"\n\n\"Mother, you'll wake the people upstairs,\" pleaded Lange--and\nSusan had never before realized how afraid of his wife the\nlittle man was.  \"For God's sake, listen to sense.\"\n\n\"After I've thrown you--into the streets,\" cried his wife,\nbeside herself with jealous fury.  \"Get dressed, I tell you!\"\nshe shouted at Susan.\n\nAnd the girl hurried into her clothes, making no further\nattempt to speak.  She knew that to plead and to explain would\nbe useless; even if Mrs. Lange believed, still she would drive\nfrom the house the temptation to her husband.  Lange, in a\nquaking, cowardly whine, begged his wife to be sensible and\nbelieve his burglar story.  But with each half-dozen words he\nuttered, she interrupted to hurl obscene epithets at him or at\nSusan.  The tenants of the upstairs flats came down.  She told\nher wrongs to a dozen half-clad men, women and children; they\ntook her side at once, and with the women leading showered vile\ninsults upon Susan.  The uproar was rising, rising.  Lange\ncowered in a corner, crying bitterly like a whipped child.\nSusan, only partly dressed, caught up her hat and rushed into\nthe hall.  Several women struck at her as she passed.  She\nstumbled on the stairs, almost fell headlong.  With the most\nfrightful words in tenement house vocabulary pursuing her she\nfled into the street, and did not pause until she was within a\nfew yards of the Bowery.  There she sat down on a doorstep and,\nhalf-crazed by the horror of her sudden downfall, laced her\nshoes and buttoned her blouse and put on her hat with fumbling,\nshaking fingers.  It had all happened so quickly that she would\nhave thought she was dreaming but for the cold night air and\nthe dingy waste of the Bowery with the streetwalkers and\ndrunken bums strolling along under the elevated tracks.  She\nhad trifled with the opportunity too long.  It had flown in\ndisgust, dislodging her as it took flight.  If she would be\nover nice and critical, would hesitate to take the only upward\npath fate saw fit to offer, then--let her seek the bottom!\nSusan peered down, and shuddered.\n\nShe went into the saloon at the corner, into the little back\nroom.  She poured down drink after drink of the frightful\npoison sold as whiskey with the permission of a government\nowned by every interest that can make big money out of a race\nof free men and so can afford to pay big bribes.  It is\ncharacteristic of this poison of the saloon of the tenement\nquarter that it produces in anyone who drinks it a species of\nquick insanity, of immediate degeneration--a desire to commit\ncrime, to do degraded acts.  Within an hour of Susan's being\nthrown into the streets, no one would have recognized her.  She\nhad been drinking, had been treating the two faded but young\nand decently dressed streetwalkers who sat at another table.\nThe three, fired and maddened by the poison, were amusing\nthemselves and two young men as recklessly intoxicated as they.\nSusan, in an attitude she had seen often enough but had never\ndreamed of taking, was laughing wildly at a coarse song, was\nstanding up, skirts caught high and body swaying in drunken\nrhythm as she led the chorus.\n\nWhen the barkeeper announced closing time, one of the young men\nsaid to her:\n\n\"Which way?\"\n\n\"To hell,\" laughed she.  \"I've been thrown out everywhere else.\nWant to go along?\"\n\n\"I'll never desert a perfect lady,\" replied he.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nSHE was like one who has fallen bleeding and broken into a\ncave; who after a time gathers himself together and crawls\ntoward a faint and far distant gleam of light; who suddenly\nsees the light no more and at the same instant lurches forward\nand down into a deeper chasm.\n\nOccasionally sheer exhaustion of nerves made it impossible for\nher to drink herself again into apathy before the effects of\nthe last doses of the poison had worn off.  In these intervals\nof partial awakening--she never permitted them to lengthen out,\nas such sensation as she had was of one\nfalling--falling--through empty space--with whirling brain and\nstrange sounds in the ears and strange distorted sights or\nhallucinations before the eyes--falling\ndown--down--whither?--to how great a depth?--or was there no\nbottom, but simply presently a plunging on down into the black\nof death's bottomless oblivion?\n\nDrink--always drink.  Yet in every other way she took care of\nher health--a strange mingling of prudence and subtle hope with\nrecklessness and frank despair.  All her refinement, baffled in\nthe moral ways, concentrated upon the physical.  She would be\nneat and well dressed; she would not let herself be seized of\nthe diseases on the pariah in those regions--the diseases\nthrough dirt and ignorance and indifference.\n\nIn the regions she now frequented recklessness was the keynote.\nThere was the hilarity of the doomed; there was the cynical or\nstolid indifference to heat or cold, to rain or shine, to rags,\nto filth, to jail, to ejection for nonpayment of rent, to\ninsult of word or blow.  The fire engines--the ambulance--the\npatrol wagon--the city dead wagon--these were all ever passing\nand repassing through those swarming streets.  It was the\nvastest, the most populous tenement area of the city.  Its\ninhabitants represented the common lot--for it is the common\nlot of the overwhelming mass of mankind to live near to\nnakedness, to shelterlessness, to starvation, without ever\nbeing quite naked or quite roofless or quite starved.  The\nmasses are eager for the necessities; the classes are eager for\nthe comforts and luxuries.  The masses are ignorant; the\nclasses are intelligent--or, at least, shrewd.  The unconscious\nand inevitable exploitation of the masses by the classes\nautomatically and of necessity stops just short of the\ncatastrophe point--for the masses must have enough to give them\nthe strength to work and reproduce.  To go down through the\nsocial system as had Susan from her original place well up\namong the classes is like descending from the beautiful dining\nroom of the palace where the meat is served in taste and\nrefinement upon costly dishes by well mannered servants to\nattractively dressed people--descending along the various stages\nof the preparation of the meat, at each stage less of\nrefinement and more of coarseness, until one at last arrives at\nthe slaughter pen.  The shambles, stinking and reeking blood\nand filth!  The shambles, with hideous groan or shriek, or more\nhideous silent look of agony!  The shambles of society where\nthe beauty and grace and charm of civilization are created out\nof noisome sweat and savage toil, out of the health and\nstrength of men and women and children, out of their ground up\nbodies, out of their ground up souls.  Susan knew those regions\nwell.  She had no theories about them, no resentment against\nthe fortunate classes, no notion that any other or better\nsystem might be possible, any other or better life for the\nmasses.  She simply accepted life as she found it, lived it as\nbest she could.\n\nThroughout the masses of mankind life is sustained by\nillusions--illusions of a better lot tomorrow, illusions of a\nheaven beyond a grave, where the nightmare, life in the body,\nwill end and the reality, life in the spirit, will begin.  She\ncould not join the throngs moving toward church and synagogue\nto indulge in their dream that the present was a dream from\nwhich death would be a joyful awakening.  She alternately\npitied and envied them.  She had her own dream that this dream,\nthe present, would end in a joyful awakening to success and\nfreedom and light and beauty.  She admitted to herself that the\ndream was probably an illusion, like that of the pious throngs.\nBut she was as unreasonably tenacious of her dream as they were\nof theirs.  She dreamed it because she was a human being--and\nto be human means to hope, and to hope means to dream of a\nbrighter future here or hereafter, or both here and hereafter.\nThe earth is peopled with dreamers; she was but one of them.\nThe last thought of despair as the black earth closes is a\nhope, perhaps the most colossal of hope's delusions, that there\nwill be escape in the grave.\n\nThere is the time when we hope and know it and believe in it.\nThere is the time when we hope and know it but have ceased to\nbelieve in it.  There is the time when we hope, believing that\nwe have altogether ceased to hope.  That time had come for\nSusan.  She seemed to think about the present.  She moved about\nlike a sleepwalker.\n\nWhat women did she know--what men?  She only dimly remembered\nfrom day to day--from hour to hour.  Blurred faces passed\nbefore her, blurred voices sounded in her ears, blurred\npersonalities touched hers.  It was like the jostling of a huge\ncrowd in night streets.  A vague sense of buffetings--of rude\ncontacts--of momentary sensations of pain, of shame, of\ndisgust, all blunted and soon forgotten.\n\nIn estimating suffering, physical or mental, to fail to take\ninto account a more important factor--the merciful paralysis or\npartial paralysis of any center of sensibility--that is\ninsistently assaulted.\n\nShe no longer had headaches or nausea after drinking deeply.\nAnd where formerly it had taken many stiff doses of liquor to\nget her into the state of recklessness or of indifference, she\nwas now able to put herself into the mood in which life was\nendurable with two or three drinks, often with only one.  The\nmost marked change was that never by any chance did she become\ngay; the sky over her life was steadily gray--gray or black, to\ngray again--never lighter.\n\nHow far she had fallen!  But swift descent or gradual, she had\nadapted herself--had, in fact, learned by much experience of\ndisaster to mitigate the calamities, to have something to keep\na certain deep-lying self of selfs intact--unaffected by what\nshe had been forced to undergo.  It seemed to her that if she\ncould get the chance--or could cure herself of the blindness\nwhich was always preventing her from seeing and seizing the\nchance that doubtless offered again and again--she could shed\nthe surface her mode of life had formed over her and would find\nunderneath a new real surface, stronger, sightly, better able\nto bear--like the skin that forms beneath the healing wound.\n\nIn these tenements, as in all tenements of all degrees, she and\nthe others of her class were fiercely resented by the heads of\nfamilies where there was any hope left to impel a striving\nupward.  She had the best furnished room in the tenement.  She\nwas the best dressed woman--a marked and instantly recognizable\nfigure because of her neat and finer clothes.  Her profession\nkept alive and active the instincts for care of the person that\neither did not exist or were momentary and feeble in the\nrespectable women.  The slovenliness, the scurrilousness of\neven the wives and daughters of the well-to-do and the rich of\nthat region would not have been tolerated in any but the lowest\nstrata of her profession, hardly even in those sought by men of\nthe laboring class.  Also, the deep horror of disease, which\nher intelligence never for an instant permitted to relax its\nhold, made her particular and careful when in other\ncircumstances drink might have reduced her to squalor.  She\nspent all her leisure time--for she no longer read--in the care\nof her person.\n\nShe was watched with frightened, yet longing and curious, eyes\nby all the girls who were at work.  The mothers hated her; many\nof them spat upon the ground after she had passed.  It was a\nheart-breaking struggle, that of these mothers to save their\ndaughters, not from prostitution, not from living with men\noutside marriage, not from moral danger, but from the practical\ndanger, the danger of bringing into the world children with no\nfather to help feed and clothe them.  In the opinion of these\npeople--an opinion often frankly expressed, rarely concealed\nwith any but the thinnest hypocrisy--the life of prostitution\nwas not so bad.  Did the life of virtue offer any attractive\nalternative?  Whether a woman was \"bad\" or \"good,\" she must\nlive in travail and die in squalor to be buried in or near the\nPotter's Field.  But if the girl still living at home were not\n\"good,\" that would mean a baby to be taken care of, would mean\nthe girl herself not a contributor to the family support but a\ndouble burden.  And if she went into prostitution, would her\nfamily get the benefit?  No.\n\nThe mothers made little effort to save their sons; they\nconcentrated on the daughters.  It was pitiful to see how in\ntheir ignorance they were unaware of the strongest forces\nworking against them.  The talk of all this motley humanity--of\n\"good\" no less than \"bad\" women, of steady workingmen, of\npolitical heelers, thieves and bums and runners for dives--was\nfrankly, often hideously, obscene.  The jammed together way of\nliving made modesty impossible, or scantest decency--made the\npictures of it among the aspiring few, usually for the benefit\nof religion or charitable visitors, a pitiful, grotesque\nhypocrisy.  Indeed, the prostitute class was the highest in\nthis respect.  The streetwalkers, those who prospered, had\nbetter masters, learned something about the pleasures and\ncharms of privacy, also had more leisure in which to think, in\nhowever crude a way, about the refinements of life, and more\nmoney with which to practice those refinements.  The boys from\nthe earliest age were on terms of licentious freedom with the\ngirls.  The favorite children's games, often played in the open\nstreet with the elders looking on and laughing, were sex games.\nThe very babies used foul language--that is, used the language\nthey learned both at home and in the street.  It was primitive\nman; Susan was at the foundation of the world.\n\nTo speak of the conditions there as a product of civilization\nis to show ignorance of the history of our race, is to fancy\nthat we are civilized today, when in fact we\nare--historically--in a turbulent and painful period of\ntransition from a better yesterday toward a tomorrow in which\nlife will be worth living as it never has been before in all\nthe ages of duration.  In this today of movement toward\ncivilization which began with the discovery of iron and will\nend when we shall have discovered how to use for the benefit of\nall the main forces of nature--in this today of agitation\nincident to journeying, we are in some respects better off, in\nother respects worse off, than the race was ten or fifteen\nthousand years ago.  We have lost much of the freedom that was\nours before the rise of governments and ruling classes; we have\ngained much--not so much as the ignorant and the unthinking and\nthe uneducated imagine, but still much.  In the end we which\nmeans the masses of us--will gain infinitely.  But gain or loss\nhas not been in so-called morality.  There is not a virtue that\nhas not existed from time ages before record.  Not a vice which\nis shallowly called \"effete\" or the \"product of\nover-civilization,\" but originated before man was man.\n\nTo speak of the conditions in which Susan Lenox now lived as\nsavagery is to misuse the word.  Every transitional stage is\naccompanied by a disintegration.  Savagery was a settled state\nin which every man and every woman had his or her fixed\nposition, settled duties and rights.  With the downfall of\nsavagery with the beginning of the journey toward that hope of\ntomorrow, civilization, everything in the relations of men with\nmen and men with women, became unsettled.  Such social systems\nas the world has known since have all been makeshift and\ntemporary--like our social systems of today, like the moral and\nextinct codes rising and sinking in power over a vast multitude\nof emigrants moving from a distant abandoned home toward a\ndistant promised land and forced to live as best they can in\nthe interval.  In the historic day's journey of perhaps fifteen\nthousand years our present time is but a brief second.  In that\nsecond there has come a breaking up of the makeshift\norganization which long served the working multitudes fairly\nwell.  The result is an anarchy in which the strong oppress the\nweak, in which the masses are being crushed by the burdens\nimposed upon them by the classes.  And in that particular part\nof the human race en route into which fate had flung Susan\nLenox conditions not of savagery but of primitive chaos were\nprevailing.  A large part of the population lived off the\nunhappy workers by prostitution, by thieving, by petty\nswindling, by politics, by the various devices in coarse, crude\nand small imitation of the devices employed by the ruling\nclasses.  And these petty parasites imitated the big parasites\nin their ways of spending their dubiously got gains.  To have\na \"good time\" was the ideal here as in idle Fifth Avenue; and\nthe notions of a \"good time\" in vogue in the two opposite\nquarters differed in degree rather than in kind.\n\nNothing to think about but the appetites and their vices.\nNothing to hope for but the next carouse.  Susan had brought\ndown with her from above one desire unknown to her associates\nand neighbors--the desire to forget.  If she could only forget!\nIf the poison would not wear off at times!\n\nShe could not quite forget.  And to be unable to forget is to\nremember--and to remember is to long--and to long is to hope.\n\nSeveral times she heard of Freddie Palmer.  Twice she chanced\nupon his name in the newspaper--an incidental reference to him\nin connection with local politics.  The other times were when\nmen talking together in the drinking places frequented by both\nsexes spoke of him as a minor power in the organization.  Each\ntime she got a sense of her remoteness, of her security.  Once\nshe passed in Grand Street a detective she had often seen with\nhim in Considine's at Broadway and Forty-second.  The \"bull\"\nlooked sharply at her.  Her heart stood still.  But he went on\nwithout recognizing her.  The sharp glance had been simply that\nofficial expression of see-all and know-all which is mere\nformality, part of the official livery, otherwise meaningless.\nHowever, it is not to that detective's discredit that he failed to\nrecognize her.  She had adapted herself to her changed surroundings.\n\nBecause she was of a different and higher class, and because\nshe picked and chose her company, even when drink had beclouded\nher senses and instinct alone remained on drowsy guard, she\nprospered despite her indifference.  For that region had its\naristocracy of rich merchants, tenement-owners, politicians\nwhose sons, close imitators of the uptown aristocracies in\nmanners and dress, spent money freely in the amusements that\nattract nearly all young men everywhere.  Susan made almost as\nmuch as she could have made in the more renowned quarters of\nthe town.  And presently she was able to move into a tenement\nwhich, except for two workingmen's families of a better class,\nwas given over entirely to fast women.  It was much better\nkept, much cleaner, much better furnished than the tenements\nfor workers chiefly; they could not afford decencies, much less\nluxuries.  All that sort of thing was, for the neighborhood,\nconcentrated in the saloons, the dance halls, the fast houses\nand the fast flats.\n\nHer walks in Grand Street and the Bowery, repelling and\ncapricious though she was with her alternating moods of cold\nmoroseness and sardonic and mocking gayety, were bringing her\nin a good sum of money for that region.  Sometimes as much as\ntwenty dollars a week, rarely less than twelve or fifteen.  And\ndespite her drinking and her freehandedness with her\nfellow-professionals less fortunate and with the street beggars\nand for tenement charities, she had in her stockings a capital\nof thirty-one dollars.\n\nShe avoided the tough places, the hang-outs of the gangs.  She\nrarely went alone into the streets at night--and the afternoons\nwere, luckily, best for business as well as for safety.  She\nmade no friends and therefore no enemies.  Without meaning to\ndo so and without realizing that she did so, she held herself\naloof without haughtiness through sense of loneliness, not at\nall through sense of superiority.  Had it not been for her\nscarlet lips, a far more marked sign in that region than\nanywhere uptown, she would have passed in the street for a more\nor less respectable woman--not thoroughly respectable; she was\ntoo well dressed, too intelligently cared for to seem the good\nworking girl.\n\nOn one of the few nights when she lingered in the little back\nroom of the saloon a few doors away at the corner, as she\nentered the dark passageway of the tenement, strong fingers\nclosed upon her throat and she was borne to the floor.  She\nknew at once that she was in the clutch of one of those terrors\nof tenement fast women, the lobbygows--men who live by lying in\nwait in the darkness to seize and rob the lonely, friendless\nfast woman.  She struggled--and she was anything but weak.  But\nnot a sound could escape from her tight-pressed throat.  Soon\nshe became unconscious.\n\nOne of the workingmen, returning drunk from the meeting of the\nunion, in the corner saloon, stumbled over her, gave her a kick\nin his anger.  This roused her; she uttered a faint cry.\n\"Thought it was a man,\" mumbled he, dragging her to a sitting\nposition.  He struck a match.  \"Oh--it's you!  Don't make any\nnoise.  If my old woman came out, she'd kill us both.\"\n\n\"Never mind me,\" said Susan.  \"I was only stunned.\"\n\n\"Oh, I thought it was the booze.  They say you hit it\nsomething fierce.\"\n\n\"No--a lobbygow.\"  And she felt for her stockings.  They were\ntorn away from her garters.  Her bosom also was bare, for the\nlobbygow had searched there, also.\n\n\"How much did he get?\"\n\n\"About thirty-five.\"\n\n\"The hell he did!  Want me to call a cop?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Susan, who was on her feet again.  \"What's the use?\"\n\n\"Those damn cops!\" cursed the workingman.  \"They'd probably pinch\nyou--or both of us.  Ten to one the lobbygows divide with them.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that,\" said Susan.  The police were most\nfriendly and most kind to her.  She was understanding the ways\nof the world better now, and appreciated that the police\nthemselves were part of the same vast system of tyranny and\nrobbery that was compelling her.  The police made her pay\nbecause they dared not refuse to be collectors.  They bound\nwhom the mysterious invisible power compelled them to bind;\nthey loosed whom that same power bade them loose.  She had no\nquarrel with the police, who protected her from far worse\noppressions and oppressors than that to which they subjected\nher.  And if they tolerated lobbygows and divided with them, it\nwas because the overshadowing power ordained it so.\n\n\"Needn't be afraid I'll blow to the cop,\" said the drunken\nartisan.  \"You can damn the cops all you please to me.  They\nmake New York worse than Russia.\"\n\n\"I guess they do the best they can--like everybody else,\" said\nthe girl wearily.\n\n\"I'll help you upstairs.\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" said she.  Not that she did not need help; but\nshe wished no disagreeable scene with the workingman's wife who\nmight open the door as they passed his family's flat.\n\nShe went upstairs, the man waiting below until she should be\nsafe--and out of the way.  She staggered into her room,\ntottered to the bed, fell upon it.  A girl named Clara, who\nlived across the hall, was sitting in a rocking-chair in a\nnightgown, reading a Bertha Clay novel and smoking a cigarette.\nShe glanced up, was arrested by the strange look in Susan's eyes.\n\n\"Hello--been hitting the pipe, I see,\" said she.  \"Down in\nGussie's room?\"\n\n\"No.  A lobbygow,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Did he get much?\"\n\n\"About thirty-five.\"\n\n\"The ----!\" cried Clara.  \"I'll bet it was Gussie's fellow.\nI've suspected him.  Him and her stay in, hitting the pipe all\nthe time.  That costs money, and she hasn't been out for I\ndon't know how long.  Let's go down there and raise hell.\"\n\n\"What's the use?\" said Susan.\n\n\"You ought to 'a' put it in the savings bank.  That's what I\ndo--when I have anything.  Then, when I'm robbed, they only get\nwhat I've just made.  Last time, they didn't get nothing--but\nme.\"  And she laughed.  Her teeth were good in front, but out\non one side and beginning to be discolored on the other.  \"How\nlong had you been saving?\"\n\n\"Nearly six months.\"\n\n\"Gee!  _Isn't_ that hell!\"  Presently she laughed.  \"Six months'\nwork and only thirty-five to show for it.  Guess you're about\nas poor at hiving it up as I am.  I give it to that loafer I\nlive with.  You give it away to anybody that wants a stake.\nWell--what's the diff?  It all goes.\"\n\n\"Give me a cigarette,\" said Susan, sitting up and inspecting\nthe bruises on her bosom and legs.  \"And get that bottle of\nwhiskey from under the soiled clothes in the bottom of the\nwashstand.\"\n\n\"It _is_ something to celebrate, isn't it?\" said Clara.  \"My\nfellow's gone to his club tonight, so I didn't go out.  I never\ndo any more, unless he's there to hang round and see that I\nain't done up.  You'll have to get a fellow.  You'll have to\ncome to it, as I'm always telling you.  They're expensive, but\nthey're company--anybody you can count on for shining up, even\nif it is for what they can get out of you, is better than not\nhaving nobody nowhere.  And they keep off bums and lobbygows\nand scare the bilkers into coughing up.\"\n\n\"Not for me,\" replied Susan.\n\nThe greater the catastrophe, the longer the time before it is\nfully realized.  Susan's loss of the money that represented so\nmuch of savage if momentary horror, and so much of unconscious\nhope this calamity did not overwhelm her for several days.\nThen she yielded for the first time to the lure of opium.  She\nhad listened longingly to the descriptions of the delights as\ngirls and men told; for practically all of them smoked--or took\ncocaine.  But to Clara's or Gussie's invitations to join the\nhappy band of dreamers, she had always replied, \"Not yet.  I'm\nsaving that.\"  Now, however, she felt that the time had come.\nHope in this world she had none.  Before the black adventure,\nwhy not try the world of blissful unreality to which it gave\nentrance?  Why leave life until she had exhausted all it put\nwithin her reach?\n\nShe went to Gussie's room at midnight and flung herself down in\na wrapper upon a couch opposite a sallow, delicate young man.\nHis great dark eyes were gazing unseeingly at her, were perhaps\nusing her as an outline sketch from which his imagination could\npicture a beauty of loveliness beyond human.  Gussie taught her\nhow to prepare the little ball of opium, how to put it on the\npipe and draw in its fumes.  Her system was so well prepared\nfor it by the poisons she had drunk that she had satisfactory\nresults from the outset.  And she entered upon the happiest\nperiod of her life thus far.  All the hideousness of her\nprofession disappeared under the gorgeous draperies of the\nimagination.  Opium's magic transformed the vile, the obscene,\ninto the lofty, the romantic, the exalted.  The world she had\nbeen accustomed to regard as real ceased to be even the blur\nthe poisonous liquors had made of it, became a vague, distant\nthing seen in a dream.  Her opium world became the vivid reality.\n\nThe life she had been leading had made her extremely thin, had\nhardened and dulled her eyes, had given her that sad,\nshuddering expression of the face upon which have beaten a\nthousand mercenary and lustful kisses.  The opium soon changed\nall this.  Her skin, always tending toward pallor, became of\nthe dead amber-white of old ivory.  Her thinness took on an\nethereal transparency that gave charm even to her slight stoop.\nHer face became dreamy, exalted, rapt; and her violet-gray eyes\nlooked from it like the vents of poetical fires burning without\nceasing upon an altar to the god of dreams.  Never had she been\nso beautiful; never had she been so happy--not with the coarser\nhappiness of dancing eye and laughing lip, but with the ecstasy\nof soul that is like the shimmers of a tranquil sea quivering\nrhythmically under the caresses of moonlight.\n\nIn her descent she had now reached that long narrow shelf along\nwhich she would walk so long as health and looks should\nlast--unless some accident should topple her off on the one\nside into suicide or on the other side into the criminal\nprostitute class.  And such accidents were likely to happen.\nStill there was a fair chance of her keeping her balance until\nloss of looks and loss of health--the end of the shelf--should\ndrop her abruptly to the very bottom.  She could guess what was\nthere.  Every day she saw about the streets, most wretched and\nmost forlorn of its wretched and forlorn things, the solitary\nold women, bent and twisted, wrapped in rotting rags, picking\npapers and tobacco from the gutters and burrowing in garbage\nbarrels, seeking somehow to get the drink or the dope that\nchanged hell into heaven for them.\n\nDespite liquor and opium and the degradations of the\nstreet-woman's life she walked that narrow ledge with curious\nsteadiness.  She was unconscious of the cause.  Indeed,\nself-consciousness had never been one of her traits.  The cause\nis interesting.\n\nIn our egotism, in our shame of what we ignorantly regard as\nthe lowliness of our origin we are always seeking alleged lofty\nspiritual explanations of our doings, and overlook the actual,\nquite simple real reason.  One of the strongest factors in\nSusan's holding herself together in face of overwhelming odds,\nwas the nearly seventeen years of early training her Aunt Fanny\nWarham had given her in orderly and systematic ways--a place\nfor everything and everything in its place; a time for\neverything and everything at its time, neatness, scrupulous\ncleanliness, no neglecting of any of the small, yet large,\nmatters that conserve the body.  Susan had not been so apt a\npupil of Fanny Warham's as was Ruth, because Susan had not\nRuth's nature of the old-maidish, cut-and-dried conventional.\nBut during the whole fundamentally formative period of her life\nSusan Lenox had been trained to order and system, and they had\nbecome part of her being, beyond the power of drink and opium\nand prostitution to disintegrate them until the general\nbreak-up should come.  In all her wanderings every man or woman\nor girl she had met who was not rapidly breaking up, but was\noffering more or less resistance to the assaults of bad habits,\nwas one who like herself had acquired in childhood strong good\nhabits to oppose the bad habits and to fight them with.  An\nenemy must be met with his own weapons or stronger.  The\nstrongest weapons that can be given a human animal for\ncombating the destructive forces of the struggle for existence\nare not good sentiments or good principles or even pious or\nmoral practices--for, bad habits can make short work of all\nthese--but are good habits in the practical, material matters\nof life.  They operate automatically, they apply to all the\nmultitude of small, every day; semi-unconscious actions of the\ndaily routine.  They preserve the _morale_.  And not morality\nbut morals is the warp of character--the part which, once\ndestroyed or even frayed, cannot be restored.\n\nSusan, unconsciously and tenaciously practicing her early\ntraining in order and system whenever she could and wherever\nshe could, had an enormous advantage over the mass of the\ngirls, both respectable and fast.  And while their evidence was\nalways toward \"going to pieces\" her tendency was always to\nrepair and to put off the break-up.\n\n\nOne June evening she was looking through the better class of\ndance halls and drinking resorts for Clara, to get her to go up\nto Gussie's for a smoke.  She opened a door she had never\nhappened to enter before--a dingy door with the glass frosted.\nJust inside there was a fetid little bar; view of the rest of\nthe room was cut off by a screen from behind which came the\nsound of a tuneless old piano.  She knew Clara would not be in\nsuch a den, but out of curiosity she glanced round the screen.\nShe was seeing a low-ceilinged room, the walls almost dripping\nwith the dirt of many and many a hard year.  In a corner was\nthe piano, battered, about to fall to pieces, its ancient and\nhorrid voice cracked by the liquor which had been poured into\nit by facetious drunkards.  At the keyboard sat an old\nhunchback, broken-jawed, dressed in slimy rags, his one eye\ninstantly fixed upon her with a lecherous expression that made\nher shiver as it compelled her to imagine the embrace he was\nevidently imagining.  His filthy fingers were pounding out a\nwaltz.  About the floor were tottering in the measure of the\nwaltz a score of dreadful old women.  They were in calico.\nThey had each a little biscuit knot of white hair firmly upon\nthe crown of the head.  From their bleached, seamed old faces\ngleamed the longings or the torments of all the passions they\ncould no longer either inspire or satisfy.  They were one time\nprostitutes, one time young, perhaps pretty women, now\ndescending to death--still prostitutes in heart and mind but\ncompelled to live as scrub women, cleaners of all manner of\nloathsome messes in dives after the drunkards had passed on.\nThey were now enjoying the reward of their toil, the pleasures\nof which they dreamed and to which they looked forward as they\ndragged their stiff old knees along the floors in the wake of\nthe brush and the cloth.  They were drinking biting poisons\nfrom tin cups--for those hands quivering with palsy could not\nbe trusted with glass-dancing with drunken, disease-swollen or\ntwisted legs--venting from ghastly toothless mouths strange\ncries of merriment that sounded like shrieks of damned souls at\nthe licking of quenchless flames.\n\nSusan stood rooted to the threshold of that frightful\nscene--that vision of the future toward which she was hurrying.\nA few years--a very few years--and, unless she should have\npassed through the Morgue, here she would be, abandoning her\nbody to abominations beyond belief at the hands of degenerate\noriental sailors to get a few pennies for the privileges of\nthis dance hall.  And she would laugh, as did these, would\nenjoy as did these, would revel in the filth her senses had\nbeen trained to find sweet.  \"No!  No!\" she protested.  \"I'd\nkill myself first!\"  And then she cowered again, as the thought\ncame that she probably would not, any more than these had\nkilled themselves.  The descent would be gradual--no matter how\nswift, still gradual.  Only the insane put an end to life.\nYes--she would come here some day.\n\nShe leaned against the wall, her throat contracting in a fit of\nnausea.  She grew cold all over; her teeth chattered.  She\ntried in vain to tear her gaze from the spectacle; some\ninvisible power seemed to be holding her head in a vise,\nthrusting her struggling eyelids violently open.\n\nThere were several men, dead drunk, asleep in old wooden chairs\nagainst the wall.  One of these men was so near her that she\ncould have touched him.  His clothing was such an assortment of\nrags slimy and greasy as one sometimes sees upon the top of a\nfilled garbage barrel to add its horrors of odor of long\nunwashed humanity to the stenches from vegetable decay.  His\nwreck of a hard hat had fallen from his head as it dropped\nforward in drunken sleep.  Something in the shape of the head\nmade her concentrate upon this man.  She gave a sharp cry,\nstretched out her hand, touched the man's shoulder.\n\n\"Rod!\" she cried.  \"Rod!\"\n\nThe head slowly lifted, and the bleary, blowsy wreck of\nRoderick Spenser's handsome face was turned stupidly toward\nher.  Into his gray eyes slowly came a gleam of recognition.\nThen she saw the red of shame burst into his hollow cheeks, and\nthe head quickly drooped.\n\nShe shook him.  \"Rod!  It's _you!_\"\n\n\"Get the hell out,\" he mumbled.  \"I want to sleep.\"\n\n\"You know me,\" she said.  \"I see the color in your face.  Oh,\nRod--you needn't be ashamed before _me_.\"\n\nShe felt him quiver under her fingers pressing upon his\nshoulder.  But he pretended to snore.\n\n\"Rod,\" she pleaded, \"I want you to come along with me.  I can't\ndo you any harm now.\"\n\nThe hunchback had stopped playing.  The old women were crowding\nround Spenser and her, were peering at them, with eyes eager\nand ears a-cock for romance--for nowhere on this earth do the\nstars shine so sweetly as down between the precipices of shame\nto the black floor of the slum's abyss.  Spenser, stooped and\nshaking, rose abruptly, thrust Susan aside with a sweep of the\narm that made her reel, bolted into the street.  She recovered\nher balance and amid hoarse croakings of \"That's right, honey!\nDon't give him up!\" followed the shambling, swaying figure.\nHe was too utterly drunk to go far; soon down he sank, a heap\nof rags and filth, against a stoop.\n\nShe bent over him, saw he was beyond rousing, straightened and\nlooked about her.  Two honest looking young Jews stopped.\n\"Won't you help me get him home?\" she said to them.\n\"Sure!\" replied they in chorus.  And, with no outward sign of\nthe disgust they must have felt at the contact, they lifted up\nthe sot, in such fantastic contrast to Susan's clean and even\nstylish appearance, and bore him along, trying to make him seem\nless the helpless whiskey-soaked dead weight.  They dragged him\nup the two flights of stairs and, as she pushed back the door,\ndeposited him on the floor.  She assured them they could do\nnothing more, thanked them, and they departed.  Clara appeared\nin her doorway.\n\n\"God Almighty, Lorna!\" she cried.  \"_What_ have you got there?\nHow'd it get in?\"\n\n\"You've been advising me to take a fellow,\" said Susan.\n\"Well--here he is.\"\n\nClara looked at her as if she thought her crazed by drink or\ndope.  \"I'll call the janitor and have him thrown out.\"\n\n\"No, he's my lover,\" said Susan.  \"Will you help me clean him up?\"\n\nClara, looking at Spenser's face now, saw those signs which not\nthe hardest of the world's hard uses can cut or tear away.\n\"Oh!\" she said, in a tone of sympathy.  \"He _is_ down, isn't he?\nBut he'll pull round all right.\"\n\nShe went into her room to take off her street clothes and to\nget herself into garments as suitable as she possessed for one\nof those noisome tasks that are done a dozen times a day by the\nbath nurses in the receiving department of a charity hospital.\nWhen she returned, Susan too was in her chemise and ready to\nbegin the search for the man, if man there was left deep buried\nin that muck.  While Susan took off the stinking and rotten\nrags, and flung them into the hall, Clara went to the bathroom\nthey and Mollie shared, and filled the tub with water as hot as\nher hand could bear.  With her foot Susan pushed the rags along\nthe hall floor and into the garbage closet.  Then she and Clara\nlifted the emaciated, dirt-streaked, filth-smeared body,\ncarried it to the bathroom, let it down into the water.  There\nwere at hand plenty of those strong, specially prepared soaps\nand other disinfectants constantly used by the women of their\nkind who still cling to cleanliness and health.  With these\nthey attacked him, not as if he were a human being, but as if\nhe were some inanimate object that must be scoured before it\ncould be used.\n\nAgain and again they let out the water, black, full of dead and\ndying vermin; again and again they rinsed him, attacked him\nafresh.  Their task grew less and less repulsive as the man\ngradually appeared, a young man with a soft skin, a well-formed\nbody, unusually good hands and feet, a distinguished face\ndespite its savage wounds from dissipation, hardly the less\nhandsome for the now fair and crisp beard which gave it a look\nof more years than Spenser had lived.\n\nIf Spenser recovered consciousness--and it seems hardly\npossible that he did not--he was careful to conceal the fact.\nHe remained limp, inert, apparently in a stupor.  They gave him\none final scrubbing, one final rinsing, one final thorough\ninspection.  \"Now, he's all right,\" declared Clara.  \"What\nshall we do with him?\"\n\n\"Put him to bed,\" said Susan.\n\nThey had already dried him off in the empty tub.  They now\nrubbed him down with a rough towel, lifted him, Susan taking\nthe shoulders, Clara the legs, and put him in Susan's bed.\nClara ran to her room, brought one of the two nightshirts she\nkept for her fellow.  When they had him in this and with a\nsheet over him, they cleaned and straightened the bathroom,\nthen lit cigarettes and sat down to rest and to admire the work\nof their hands.\n\n\"Who is he?\" asked Clara.\n\n\"A man I used to know,\" said Susan.  Like all the girls in that\nlife with a real story to tell, she never told about her past\nself.  Never tell?  They never even remember if drink and drugs\nwill do their duty.\n\n\"I don't blame you for loving him,\" said Clara.  \"Somehow, the\nlower a man sinks the more a woman loves him.  It's the other\nway with men.  But then men don't know what love is.  And a\nwoman don't really know till she's been through the mill.\"\n\n\"I don't love him,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Same thing,\" replied the practical Clara, with a wave of the\nbare arm at the end of which smoked the cigarette.  \"What're\nyou going to do with him?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" confessed Susan.\n\nShe was not a little uneasy at the thought of his awakening.\nWould he despise her more than ever now--fly from her back to\nhis filth?  Would he let her try to help him?  And she looked\nat the face which had been, in that other life so long, long\nago, dearer to her than any face her eyes had ever rested upon;\na sob started deep down within her, found its slow and painful\nway upward, shaking her whole body and coming from between her\nclenched teeth in a groan.  She forgot all she had suffered\nfrom Rod--forgot the truth about him which she had slowly\npuzzled out after she left him and as experience enabled her to\nunderstand actions she had not understood at the time.  She\nforgot it all.  That past--that far, dear, dead past!  Again\nshe was a simple, innocent girl upon the high rock, eating that\nwonderful dinner.  Again the evening light faded, stars and\nmoon came out, and she felt the first sweet stirring of love\nfor him.  She could hear his voice, the light, clear,\nentrancing melody of the Duke's song--\n\n\n                     La Donna è mobile\n                     Qua penna al vento--\n\n\nShe burst into tears--tears that drenched her soul as the rain\ndrenches the blasted desert and makes the things that could\nlive in beauty stir deep in its bosom.  And Clara, sobbing in\nsympathy, kissed her and stole away, softly closing the door.\n\"If a man die, shall he live again?\" asked the old Arabian\nphilosopher.  If a woman die, shall she live again?. . .\nShall not that which dies in weakness live again in strength?. . .\nLooking at him, as he lay there sleeping so quietly, her\nbeing surged with the heaving of high longings and hopes.\nIf _they_ could only live again!  Here they were, together, at\nthe lowest depth, at the rock bottom of life.  If they could\nbuild on that rock, build upon the very foundation of the\nworld, then would they indeed build in strength!  Then, nothing\ncould destroy--nothing!. . .  If they could live again!  If\nthey could build!\n\nShe had something to live for--something to fight for.  Into\nher eyes came a new light; into her soul came peace and\nstrength.  Something to live for--someone to redeem.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nSHE fell asleep, her head resting upon her hand, her elbow on\nthe arm of the chair.  She awoke with a shiver; she opened her\neyes to find him gazing at her.  The eyes of both shifted\ninstantly.  \"Wouldn't you like some whiskey?\" she asked.\n\n\"Thanks,\" replied he, and his unchanged voice reminded her\nvividly of his old self, obscured by the beard and by the\ndissipated look.\n\nShe took the bottle from its concealment in the locked\nwashstand drawer, poured him out a large drink.  When she came\nback where he could see the whiskey in the glass, his eyes\nglistened and he raised himself first on his elbow, then to a\nsitting position.  His shaking hand reached out eagerly and his\nexpectant lips quivered.  He gulped the whiskey down.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said, gazing longingly at the bottle as he held\nthe empty glass toward her.\n\n\"More?\"\n\n\"I _would_ like a little more,\" said he gratefully.\n\nAgain she poured him a large drink, and again he gulped it\ndown.  \"That's strong stuff,\" said he.  \"But then they sell\nstrong stuff in this part of town.  The other kind tastes weak\nto me now.\"\n\nHe dropped back against the pillows.  She poured herself a\ndrink.  Halfway to her lips the glass halted.  \"I've got to\nstop that,\" thought she, \"if I'm going to do anything for him\nor for myself.\"  And she poured the whiskey back and put the\nbottle away.  The whole incident took less than five seconds.\nIt did not occur that she was essaying and achieving the\nheroic, that she had in that instant revealed her right to her\ndream of a career high above the common lot.\n\n\"Don't _you_ drink?\" said he.\n\n\"I've decided to cut it out,\" replied she carelessly.  \"There's\nnothing in it.\"\n\n\"I couldn't live without it--and wouldn't.\"\n\n\"It _is_ a comfort when one's on the way down,\" said she.  \"But\nI'm going to try the other direction--for a change.\"\n\nShe held a box of cigarettes toward him.  He took one, then\nshe; she held the lighted match for him, lit her own cigarette,\nlet the flame of the match burn on, she absently watching it.\n\n\"Look out!  You'll burn yourself!\" cried he.\n\nShe started, threw the match into the slop jar.  \"How do you\nfeel?\" inquired she.\n\n\"Like the devil,\" he answered.  \"But then I haven't known what\nit was to feel any other way for several months except when I\ncouldn't feel at all.\"  A long silence, both smoking, he\nthinking, she furtively watching him.  \"You haven't changed so\nmuch,\" he finally said.  \"At least, not on the outside.\"\n\n\"More on the outside than on the inside,\" said she.  \"The\ninside doesn't change much.  There I'm almost as I was that day\non the big rock.  And I guess you are, too--aren't you?\"\n\n\"The devil I am!  I've grown hard and bitter.\"\n\n\"That's all outside,\" declared she.  \"That's the shell--like\nthe scab that stays over the sore spot till it heals.\"\n\n\"Sore spot?  I'm nothing but sore spots.  I've been treated\nlike a dog.\"\n\nAnd he proceeded to talk about the only subject that interested\nhim--himself.  He spoke in a defensive way, as if replying to\nsomething she had said or thought.  \"I've not got down in the\nworld without damn good excuse.  I wrote several plays, and\nthey were tried out of town.  But we never could get into New\nYork.  I think Brent was jealous of me, and his influence kept\nme from a hearing.  I know it sounds conceited, but I'm sure\nI'm right.\"\n\n\"Brent?\" said she, in a queer voice.  \"Oh, I think you must be\nmistaken.  He doesn't look like a man who could do petty mean\nthings.  No, I'm sure he's not petty.\"\n\n\"Do you know him?\" cried Spenser, in an irritated tone.\n\n\"No.  But--someone pointed him out to me once--a long time\nago--one night in the Martin.  And then--you'll remember--there\nused to be a great deal of talk about him when we lived in\nForty-third Street.  You admired him tremendously.\"\n\n\"Well, he's responsible,\" said Spenser, sullenly.  \"The men on\ntop are always trampling down those who are trying to climb up.\nHe had it in for me.  One of my friends who thought he was a\ndecent chap gave him my best play to read.  He returned it with\nsome phrases about its showing talent--one of those phrases\nthat don't mean a damn thing.  And a few weeks ago--\" Spenser\nraised himself excitedly--\"the thieving hound produced a play\nthat was a clean steal from mine.  I'd be laughed at if I\nprotested or sued.  But I _know_, curse him!\"\n\nHe fell back shaking so violently that his cigarette dropped to\nthe sheet.  Susan picked it up, handed it to him.  He eyed her\nwith angry suspicion.  \"You don't believe me, do you?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I don't know anything about it,\" replied she.  \"Anyhow, what\ndoes it matter?  The man I met on that show boat--the Mr.\nBurlingham I've often talked about--he used to say that the dog\nthat stopped to lick his scratches never caught up with the prey.\"\n\nHe flung himself angrily in the bed.  \"You never did have any\nheart--any sympathy.  But who has?  Even Drumley went back on\nme--let 'em put a roast of my last play in the _Herald_--a\ntelegraphed roast from New Haven--said it was a dead failure.\nAnd who wrote it?  Why, some newspaper correspondent in the pay\nof the _Syndicate_--and that means Brent.  And of course it was\na dead failure.  So--I gave up--and here I am. . . .  This\nyour room?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Where's this nightshirt come from?\"\n\n\"It belongs to the friend of the girl across the hall.\"  He\nlaughed sneeringly.  \"The hell it does!\" mocked he.  \"I\nunderstand perfectly.  I want my clothes.\"\n\n\"No one is coming,\" said Susan.  \"There's no one to come.\"\n\nHe was looking round the comfortable little room that was the\ntalk of the whole tenement and was stirring wives and fast\nwomen alike to \"do a little fixing up.\"  Said he:\n\n\"A nice little nest you've made for him.  You always were good\nat that.\"\n\n\"I've made it for myself,\" said she.  \"I never bring men here.\"\n\n\"I want my clothes,\" cried he.  \"I haven't sunk that low, you----!\"\n\nThe word he used did not greatly disturb Susan.  The shell she\nhad formed over herself could ward off brutal contacts of\nlanguages no less than of the other kinds.  It did, however,\nshock her a little to hear Rod Spenser use a word so crude.\n\n\"Give me my clothes,\" he ordered, waving his fists in a fierce,\nfeeble gesture.\n\n\"They were torn all to pieces.  I threw them away.  I'll get\nyou some more in the morning.\"\n\nHe dropped back again, a scowl upon his face.  \"I've got no\nmoney--not a damn cent.  I did half a day's work on the docks\nand made enough to quiet me last night.\"  He raised himself.\n\"I can work again.  Give me my clothes!\"\n\n\"They're gone,\" said Susan.  \"They were completely used up.\"\n\nThis brought back apparently anything but dim memory of what\nhis plight had been.  \"How'd I happen to get so clean?\"\n\n\"Clara and I washed you off a little.  You had fallen down.\"\n\nHe lay silent a few minutes, then said in a hesitating, ashamed\ntone, \"My troubles have made me a boor.  I beg your pardon.\nYou've been tremendously kind to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, it wasn't much.  Don't you feel sleepy?\"\n\n\"Not a bit.\"  He dragged himself from the bed.  \"But _you_ do.\nI must go.\"\n\nShe laughed in the friendliest way.  \"You can't.  You haven't\nany clothes.\"\n\nHe passed his hand over his face and coughed violently, she\nholding his head and supporting his emaciated shoulders.  After\nseveral minutes of coughing and gagging, gasping and groaning\nand spitting, he was relieved by the spasm and lay down again.\nWhen he got his breath, he said--with rest between words--\"I'd\nask you to send for the ambulance, but if the doctors catch me,\nthey'll lock me away.  I've got consumption.  Oh, I'll soon be\nout of it.\"\n\nSusan sat silent.  She did not dare look at him lest he should\nsee the pity and horror in her eyes.\n\n\"They'll find a cure for it,\" pursued he.  \"But not till the\nday after I'm gone.  That is the way my luck runs.  Still, I\ndon't see why I should care to stay--and I don't!  Have you any\nmore of that whiskey?\"\n\nSusan brought out the bottle again, gave him the last of the\nwhiskey--a large drink.  He sat up, sipping it to make it last.\nHe noted the long row of books on the shelf fastened along the\nwall beside the bed, the books and magazines on the table.\nSaid he:\n\n\"As fond of reading as ever, I see?\"\n\n\"Fonder,\" said she.  \"It takes me out of myself.\"\n\n\"I suppose you read the sort of stuff you really like, now--not\nthe things you used to read to make old Drumley think you were\ncultured and intellectual.\"\n\n\"No--the same sort,\" replied she, unruffled by his\ncontemptuous, unjust fling.  \"Trash bores me.\"\n\n\"Come to think of it, I guess you did have pretty good taste\nin books.\"\n\nBut he was interested in himself, like all invalids; and, like\nthem, he fancied his own intense interest could not but be\nshared by everyone.  He talked on and on of himself, after the\nmanner of failures--told of his wrongs, of how friends had\nbetrayed him, of the jealousies and enmities his talents had\nprovoked.  Susan was used to these hard-luck stories, was used\nto analyzing them.  With the aid of what she had worked out as\nto his character after she left him, she had no difficulty in\nseeing that he was deceiving himself, was excusing himself.\nBut after all she had lived through, after all she had\ndiscovered about human frailty, especially in herself, she was\nnot able to criticize, much less condemn, anybody.  Her doubts\nmerely set her to wondering whether he might not also be\nself-deceived as to his disease.\n\n\"Why do you think you've got consumption?\" asked she.\n\n\"I was examined at the free dispensary up in Second Avenue the\nother day.  I've suspected what was the matter for several\nmonths.  They told me I was right.\"\n\n\"But the doctors are always making mistakes.  I'd not give up\nif I were you.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose I would if I had anything to live for?\"\n\n\"I was thinking about that a while ago--while you were asleep.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm all in.  That's a cinch.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" said she.  \"And as we've nothing to lose and no hope,\nwhy, trying to do something won't make us any worse off. . . .\nWe've both struck the bottom.  We can't go any lower.\"  She\nleaned forward and, with her earnest eyes fixed upon him,\nsaid, \"Rod--why not try--together?\"\n\nHe closed his eyes.\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't be of much use to you,\" she went on.  \"But\nyou can help me.  And helping me will make you help yourself.\nI can't get up alone.  I've tried.  No doubt it's my fault.  I\nguess I'm one of those women that aren't hard enough or\nself-confident enough to do what's necessary unless I've got\nsome man to make me do it.  Perhaps I'd get the--the strength\nor whatever it is, when I was much older.  But by that time in\nmy case--I guess it'd be too late.  Won't you help me, Rod?\"\n\nHe turned his head away, without opening his eyes.\n\n\"You've helped me many times--beginning with the first day we met.\"\n\n\"Don't,\" he said.  \"I went back on you.  I did sprain my ankle,\nbut I could have come.\"\n\n\"That wasn't anything,\" replied she.  \"You had already done a\nthousand times more than you needed to do.\"\n\nHis hand wandered along the cover in her direction.  She\ntouched it.  Their hands clasped.\n\n\"I lied about where I got the money yesterday.  I didn't work.\nI begged.  Three of us--from the saloon they call the Owl's\nChute--two Yale men--one of them had been a judge--and I.\nWe've been begging for a week.  We were going out on the road\nin a few days--to rob.  Then--I saw you--in that old women's\ndance hall--the Venusberg, they call it.\"\n\n\"You've come down here for me, Rod.  You'll take me back?\nYou'll save me from the Venusberg?\"\n\n\"I couldn't save anybody.  Susie, at bottom I'm N. G.  I\nalways was--and I knew it.  Weak--vain.  But you!  If you\nhadn't been a woman--and such a sweet, considerate one you'd\nhave never got down here.\"\n\n\"Such a fool,\" corrected Susan.  \"But, once I get up, I'll not\nbe so again.  I'll fight under the rules, instead of acting in\nthe silly way they teach us as children.\"\n\n\"Don't say those hard things, Susie!\"\n\n\"Aren't they true?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I can't bear to hear them from a woman. . . .  I\ntold you that you hadn't changed.  But after I'd looked at you\na while I saw that you have.  You've got a terrible look in\nyour eyes--wonderful and terrible.  You had something of that\nlook as a child--the first time I saw you.\"\n\n\"The day after my marriage,\" said the girl, tearing her\nface away.\n\n\"It was there then,\" he went on.  \"But now--it's--it's\nheartbreaking, Susie when your face is in repose.\"\n\n\"I've gone through a fire that has burned up every bit of me\nthat can burn,\" said she.  \"I've been wondering if what's left\nisn't strong enough to do something with.  I believe so--if\nyou'll help me.\"\n\n\"Help you?  I--help anybody?  Don't mock me, Susie.\"\n\n\"I don't know about anybody else,\" said she sweetly and gently,\n\"but I do know about me.\"\n\n\"No use--too late.  I've lost my nerve.\"  He began to sob.\n\"It's because I'm unstrung,\" explained he.\n\n\"Don't think I'm a poor contemptible fool of a whiner. . . .\nYes, I _am_ a whiner!  Susie, I ought to have been the woman\nand you the man.  Weak--weak--weak!\"\n\nShe turned the gas low, bent over him, kissed his brow,\ncaressed him.  \"Let's do the best we can,\" she murmured.\n\nHe put his arm round her.  \"I wonder if there _is_ any hope,\" he\nsaid.  \"No--there couldn't be.\"\n\n\"Let's not hope,\" pleaded she.  \"Let's just do the best we can.\"\n\n\"What--for instance?\"\n\n\"You know the theater people.  You might write a little play--a\nsketch--and you and I could act it in one of the ten-cent houses.\"\n\n\"That's not a bad idea!\" exclaimed he.  \"A little comedy--about\nfifteen or twenty minutes.\"  And he cast about for a plot,\nfound the beginnings of one the ancient but ever acceptable\ncommonplace of a jealous quarrel between two lovers--\"I'll lay\nthe scene in Fifth Avenue--there's nothing low life likes so\nmuch as high life.\"  He sketched, she suggested.  They planned\nuntil broad day, then fell asleep, she half sitting up, his\nhead pillowed upon her lap.\n\nShe was awakened by a sense of a parching and suffocating heat.\nShe started up with the idea of fire in her drowsy mind.  But\na glance at him revealed the real cause.  His face was fiery\nred, and from his lips came rambling sentences, muttered,\nwhispered, that indicated the delirium of a high fever.  She\nhad first seen it when she and the night porter broke into\nBurlingham's room in the Walnut Street House, in Cincinnati.\nShe had seen it many a time since; for, while she herself had\nnever been ill, she had been surrounded by illness all the\ntime, and the commonest form of it was one of these fevers,\noutraged nature's frenzied rise against the ever denser swarms\nof enemies from without which the slums sent to attack her.\nSusan ran across the hall and roused Clara, who would watch\nwhile she went for a doctor.  \"You'd better get Einstein in\nGrand Street,\" Clara advised.\n\n\"Why not Sacci?\" asked Susan.\n\n\"Our doctor doesn't know anything but the one thing--and\nhe doesn't like to take other kinds of cases.  No, get\nEinstein. . . .  You know, he's like all of them--he won't\ncome unless you pay in advance.\"\n\n\"How much?\" asked Susan.\n\n\"Three dollars.  I'll lend you if----\"\n\n\"No--I've got it.\"  She had eleven dollars and sixty cents in\nthe world.\n\nEinstein pronounced it a case of typhoid.  \"You must get him to\nthe hospital at once.\"\n\nSusan and Clara looked at each other in terror.  To them, as to\nthe masses everywhere, the hospital meant almost certain death;\nfor they assumed--and they had heard again and again\naccusations which warranted it--that the public hospital\ndoctors and nurses treated their patients with neglect always,\nwith downright inhumanity often.  Not a day passed without\ntheir hearing some story of hospital outrage upon poverty,\nwithout their seeing someone--usually some child--who was\npaying a heavy penalty for having been in the charity wards.\n\nEinstein understood their expression.  \"Nonsense!\" said he\ngruffly.  \"You girls look too sensible to believe those silly lies.\"\n\nSusan looked at him steadily.  His eyes shifted.  \"Of course, the\npay service _is_ better,\" said he in a strikingly different tone.\n\n\"How much would it be at a pay hospital?\" asked Susan.\n\n\"Twenty-five a week including my services,\" said Doctor\nEinstein.  \"But you can't afford that.\"\n\n\"Will he get the best treatment for that?\"\n\n\"The very best.  As good as if he were Rockefeller or the big\nchap uptown.\"\n\n\"In advance, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Would we ever get our money out of people if we didn't get it\nin advance?  We've got to live just the same as any other class.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said the girl.  \"I don't blame you.  I don't\nblame anybody for anything.\"  She said to Clara, \"Can you lend\nme twenty?\"\n\n\"Sure.  Come in and get it.\"  When she and Susan were in the\nhall beyond Einstein's hearing, she went on:  \"I've got the\ntwenty and you're welcome to it.  But--Lorna hadn't you\nbetter----\"\n\n\"In the same sort of a case, what'd _you_ do?\" interrupted Susan.\n\nClara laughed.  \"Oh--of course.\"  And she gave Susan a roll of\nmuch soiled bills--a five, the rest ones and twos.\n\n\"I can get the ambulance to take him free,\" said Einstein.\n\"That'll save you five for a carriage.\"\n\nShe accepted this offer.  And when the ambulance went, with\nSpenser burning and raving in the tightly wrapped blankets,\nSusan followed in a street car to see with her own eyes that he\nwas properly installed.  It was arranged that she could visit\nhim at any hour and stay as long as she liked.\n\nShe returned to the tenement, to find the sentiment of the\nentire neighborhood changed toward her.  Not loss of money, not\nloss of work, not dispossession nor fire nor death is the\nsupreme calamity among the poor, but sickness.  It is their\nmost frequent visitor--sickness in all its many frightful\nforms--rheumatism and consumption, cancer and typhoid and the\nrest of the monsters.  Yet never do the poor grow accustomed or\nhardened.  And at the sight of the ambulance the neighborhood\nhad been instantly stirred.  When the reason for its coming got\nabout, Susan became the object of universal sympathy and\nrespect.  She was not sending her friend to be neglected and\nkilled at a charity hospital; she was paying twenty-five a week\nthat he might have a chance for life--twenty-five dollars a\nweek!  The neighbors felt that her high purpose justified any\nmeans she might be compelled to employ in getting the money.\nWomen who had scowled and spat as she walked by, spoke\nfriendlily to her and wiped their eyes with their filthy\nskirts, and prayed in church and synagogue that she might\nprosper until her man was well and the old debt paid.  Clara\nwent from group to group, relating the whole story, and the\ntears flowed at each recital.  Money they had none to give; but\nwhat they had they gave with that generosity which suddenly\ntransfigures rags and filth and makes foul and distorted bodies\nlift in the full dignity of membership in the human family.\nEverywhere in those streets were seen the ravages of\ndisease--rheumatism and rickets and goiter, wen and tumors and\ncancer, children with only one arm or one leg, twisted spines,\nsunken chests, distorted hips, scrofulous eyes and necks, all\nthe sad markings of poverty's supreme misery, the ferocious\npenalties of ignorance, stupidity and want.  But Susan's burden\nof sorrow was not on this account overlooked.\n\nRafferty, who kept the saloon at the corner and was chief\nlieutenant to O'Frayne, the District Leader, sent for her and\nhanded her a twenty.  \"That may help some,\" said he.\n\nSusan hesitated--gave it back.  \"Thank you,\" said she, \"and\nperhaps later I'll have to get it from you.  But I don't want\nto get into debt.  I already owe twenty.\"\n\n\"This ain't debt,\" explained Rafferty.  \"Take it and forget it.\"\n\n\"I couldn't do that,\" said the girl.  \"But maybe you'll lend it\nto me, if I need it in a week or so?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said the puzzled saloon man--liquor store man, he\npreferred to be called, or politician.  \"Any amount you want.\"\n\nAs she went away he looked after her, saying to his barkeeper:\n\"What do you think of that, Terry?  I offered her a twenty and\nshe sidestepped.\"\n\nTerry's brother had got drunk a few days before, had killed a\nwoman and was on his way to the chair.  Terry scowled at the\nboss and said:\n\n\"She's got a right to, ain't she?  Don't she earn her money\nhonest, without harmin' anybody but herself?  There ain't many\nthat can say that--not any that runs factories and stores and\nholds their noses up as if they smelt their own sins, damn 'em!\"\n\n\"She's a nice girl,\" said Rafferty, sauntering away.  He was a\nbroad, tolerant and good-humored man; he made allowances for an\nemployee whose brother was in for murder.\n\nSusan had little time to spend at the hospital.  She must now\nearn fifty dollars a week--nearly double the amount she had\nbeen averaging.  She must pay the twenty-five dollars for\nSpenser, the ten dollars for her lodgings.  Then there was the\nseven dollars which must be handed to the police captain's\n\"wardman\" in the darkness of some entry every Thursday night.\nShe had been paying the patrolman three dollars a week to keep\nhim in a good humor, and two dollars to the janitor's wife; she\nmight risk cutting out these items for the time, as both\njanitor's wife and policeman were sympathetic.  But on the\nclosest figuring, fifty a week would barely meet her absolute\nnecessities--would give her but seven a week for food and other\nexpenses and nothing toward repaying Clara.\n\nFifty dollars a week!  She might have a better chance to make\nit could she go back to the Broadway-Fifth Avenue district.\nBut however vague other impressions from the life about her\nmight have been, there had been branded into her a deep and\nterrible fear of the police an omnipotence as cruel as destiny\nitself--indeed, the visible form of that sinister god at\npresent.  Once in the pariah class, once with a \"police\nrecord,\" and a man or woman would have to scale the steeps of\nrespectability up to a far loftier height than Susan ever\ndreamed of again reaching, before that malign and relentless\npower would abandon its tyranny.  She did not dare risk\nadventuring a part of town where she had no \"pull\" and where,\neven should she by chance escape arrest, Freddie Palmer would\nhear of her; would certainly revenge himself by having her\narrested and made an example of.  In the Grand Street district\nshe must stay, and she must \"stop the nonsense\" and \"play the\ngame\"--must be business-like.\n\nShe went to see the \"wardman,\" O'Ryan, who under the guise of\nbeing a plain clothes man or detective, collected and turned in\nto the captain, who took his \"bit\" and passed up the rest, all\nthe money levied upon saloons, dives, procuresses, dealers in\nunlawful goods of any kind from opium and cocaine to girls for\n\"hock shops.\"\n\nO'Ryan was a huge brute of a man, his great hard face bearing\nthe scars of battles against pistol, knife, bludgeon and fist.\nHe was a sour and savage brute, hated and feared by everyone\nfor his tyrannies over the helpless poor and the helpless\noutcast class.  He had primitive masculine notions as to\nfeminine virtue, intact despite the latter day general\ndisposition to concede toleration and even a certain\nrespectability to prostitutes.  But by some chance which she\nand the other girls did not understand he treated Susan with\nthe utmost consideration, made the gangs appreciate that if\nthey annoyed her or tried to drag her into the net of tribute\nin which they had enmeshed most of the girls worth while, he\nwould regard it as a personal defiance to himself.\n\nSusan waited in the back room of the saloon nearest O'Ryan's\nlodgings and sent a boy to ask him to come.  The boy came back\nwith the astonishing message that she was to come to O'Ryan's\nflat.  Susan was so doubtful that she paused to ask the\njanitress about it.\n\n\"It's all right,\" said the janitress.  \"Since his wife died\nthree years ago him and his baby lives alone.  There's his old\nmother but she's gone out.  He's always at home when he ain't\non duty.  He takes care of the baby himself, though it howls\nall the time something awful.\"\n\nSusan ascended, found the big policeman in his shirt sleeves,\ntrying to soothe the most hideous monstrosity she had ever\nseen--a misshapen, hairy animal looking like a monkey, like a\nrat, like half a dozen repulsive animals, and not at all like\na human being.  The thing was clawing and growling and grinding\nits teeth.  At sight of Susan it fixed malevolent eyes on her\nand began to snap its teeth at her.\n\n\"Don't mind him,\" said O'Ryan.  \"He's only acting up queer.\"\n\nSusan sat not daring to look at the thing lest she should show\nher aversion, and not knowing how to state her business when the\nthing was so clamorous, so fiendishly uproarious.  After a time\nO'Ryan succeeded in quieting it.  He seemed to think some\nexplanation was necessary.  He began abruptly, his gaze\ntenderly on the awful creature, his child, lying quiet now in\nhis arms:\n\n\"My wife--she died some time ago--died when the baby here was born.\"\n\n\"You spend a good deal of time with it,\" said Susan.\n\n\"All I can spare from my job.  I'm afraid to trust him to\nanybody, he being kind of different.  Then, too, I _like_ to\ntake care of him.  You see, it's all I've got to remember _her_\nby.  I'm kind o' tryin' to do what _she'd_ want did.\"  His lips\nquivered.  He looked at his monstrous child.  \"Yes, I _like_\nsettin' here, thinkin'--and takin' care of him.\"\n\nThis brute of a slave driver, this cruel tyrant over the poor\nand the helpless--yet, thus tender and gentle--thus capable of\nthe enormous sacrifice of a great, pure love!\n\n\"_You've_ got a way of lookin' out of the eyes that's like her,\"\nhe went on--and Susan had the secret of his strange forbearance\ntoward her.  \"I suppose you've come about being let off on the\nassessment?\"\n\nAlready he knew the whole story of Rod and the hospital.\n\"Yes--that's why I'm bothering you,\" said she.\n\n\"You needn't pay but five-fifty.  I can only let you off a\ndollar and a half--my bit and the captain's.  We pass the rest\non up--and we don't dare let you off.\"\n\n\"Oh, I can make the money,\" Susan said hastily.  \"Thank you,\nMr. O'Ryan, but I don't want to get anyone into trouble.\"\n\n\"We've got the right to knock off one dollar and a half,\" said\nO'Ryan.  \"But if we let you off the other, the word would get\nup to--to wherever the graft goes--and they'd send down along\nthe line, to have merry hell raised with us.  The whole thing's\ndone systematic, and they won't take no excuses, won't allow no\nbreaks in the system nowhere.  You can see for yourself--it'd go\nto smash if they did.\"\n\n\"Somebody must get a lot of money,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Oh, it's dribbled out--and as you go higher up, I don't\nsuppose them that gets it knows where it comes from.  The whole\nworld's nothing but graft, anyhow.  Sorry I can't let you off.\"\n\nThe thing in his lap had recovered strength for a fresh fit of\nmalevolence.  It was tearing at its hairy, hideous face with\nits claws and was howling and shrieking, the big father gently\ntrying to soothe it--for _her_ sake.  Susan got away quickly.\nShe halted in the deserted hall and gave way to a spasm of dry\nsobbing--an overflow of all the emotions that had been\naccumulating within her.  In this world of noxious and\nrepulsive weeds, what sudden startling upshooting of what\nbeautiful flowers!  Flowers where you would expect to find the\nmost noisome weeds of all, and vilest weeds where you would\nexpect to find flowers.  What a world!\n\nHowever--the fifty a week must be got--and she must be\nbusiness-like.\n\nMost of the girls who took to the streets came direct from the\ntenements of New York, of the foreign cities or of the factory\ntowns of New England.  And the world over, tenement house life\nis an excellent school for the life of the streets.  It\nprevents modesty from developing; it familiarizes the eye, the\near, the nerves, to all that is brutal; it takes away from a\ngirl every feeling that might act as a restraining influence\nexcept fear--fear of maternity, of disease, of prison.  Thus,\npractically all the other girls had the advantage over Susan.\nSoon after they definitely abandoned respectability and\nappeared in the streets frankly members of the profession, they\nbecame bold and rapacious.  They had an instinctive feeling\nthat their business was as reputable as any other, more\nreputable than many held in high repute, that it would be most\nreputable if it paid better and were less uncertain.  They\nrespected themselves for all things, talk to the contrary in\nthe search for the sympathy and pity most human beings crave.\nThey despised the men as utterly as the men despised them.\nThey bargained as shamelessly as the men.  Even those who did\nnot steal still felt that stealing was justifiable; for, in the\nstreets the sex impulse shows stripped of all disguise, shows\nas a brutal male appetite, and the female feels that her\nyielding to it entitles her to all she can compel and cozen and\ncrib.  Susan had been unfitted for her profession--as for all\nactive, unsheltered life--by her early training.  The point of\nview given us in our childhood remains our point of view as to\nall the essentials of life to the end.  Reason, experience, the\ninfluence of contact with many phases of the world, may change\nus seemingly, but the under-instinct remains unchanged.  Thus,\nSusan had never lost, and never would lose her original\nrepugnance; not even drink had ever given her the courage to\napproach men or to bargain with them.  Her shame was a false\nshame, like most of the shame in the world--a lack of courage,\nnot a lack of desire--and, however we may pretend, there can be\nno virtue in abstinence merely through cowardice.  Still, if\nthere be merit in shrinking, even when the cruelest necessities\nwere goading, that merit was hers in full measure.  As a matter\nof reason and sense, she admitted that the girls who respected\nthemselves and practiced their profession like merchants of\nother kinds were right, were doing what she ought to do.\nAnyhow, it was absurd to practice a profession half-heartedly.\nTo play your game, whatever it might be, for all there was in\nit--that was the obvious first principle of success.  Yet--she\nremained laggard and squeamish.\n\nWhat she had been unable to do for herself, to save herself\nfrom squalor, from hunger, from cold, she was now able to do\nfor the sake of another--to help the man who had enabled her to\nescape from that marriage, more hideous than anything she had\nendured since, or ever could be called upon to endure--to save\nhim from certain neglect and probable death in the \"charity\"\nhospital.  Not by merely tolerating the not too impossible men\nwho joined her without sign from her, and not by merely\naccepting what they gave, could fifty dollars a week be made.\nShe must dress herself in franker avowal of her profession,\nmust look as expensive as her limited stock of clothing,\nsupplemented by her own taste, would permit.  She must flirt,\nmust bargain, must ask for presents, must make herself\nagreeable, must resort to the crude female arts--which,\nhowever, are subtle enough to convince the self-enchanted male\neven in face of the discouraging fact of the mercenary\narrangement.  She must crush down her repugnance, must be\nactive, not simply passive--must get the extra dollars by\nstimulating male appetites, instead of simply permitting them\nto satisfy themselves.  She must seem rather the eager mistress\nthan the reluctant and impatient wife.\n\nAnd she did abruptly change her manner.  There was in her, as\nher life had shown, a power of endurance, an ability to\nsacrifice herself in order to do the thing that seemed\nnecessary, and to do it without shuffling or whining.  Whatever\nelse her career had done for her, it undoubtedly had\nstrengthened this part of her nature.  And now the result of\nher training showed.  With her superior intelligence for the\nfirst time free to make the best of her opportunities, she\nabruptly became equal to the most consummate of her sisters in\nthat long line of her sister-panders to male appetites which\nextends from the bought wife or mistress or fiancee of the rich\ngrandee down all the social ranks to the wife or street girl\ncozening for a tipsy day-laborer's earnings on a Saturday night\nand the work girl teasing her \"steady company\" toward matrimony\non the park bench or in the dark entry of the tenement.\n\nShe was able to pay Clara back in less than ten days.  In\nSpenser's second week at the hospital she had him moved to\nbetter quarters and better attendance at thirty dollars a week.\n\nAlthough she had never got rid of her most unprofessional habit\nof choosing and rejecting, there had been times when need\nforced her into straits where her lot seemed to her almost as\nlow as that of the slave-like wives of the tenements, made her\nalmost think she would be nearly as well off were she the wife,\ncompanion, butt, servant and general vent to some one dull and\ndistasteful provider of a poor living.  But now she no longer\nfelt either degraded or heart sick and heart weary.  And when\nhe passed the worst crisis her spirits began to return.\n\nAnd when Roderick should be well, and the sketch written--and\nan engagement got--Ah, then!  Life indeed--life, at last!  Was\nit this hope that gave her the strength to fight down and\nconquer the craving for opium?  Or was it the necessity of\nkeeping her wits and of saving every cent?  Or was it because\nthe opium habit, like the drink habit, like every other habit,\nis a matter of a temperament far more than it is a matter of an\nappetite--and that she had the appetite but not the\ntemperament?  No doubt this had its part in the quick and\ncomplete victory.  At any rate, fight and conquer she did.  The\nstrongest interest always wins.  She had an interest stronger\nthan love of opium--an interest that substituted itself for opium\nand for drink and supplanted them.  Life indeed--life, at last!\n\nIn his third week Rod began to round toward health.  Einstein\nobserved from the nurse's charts that Susan's visits were\nhaving an unfavorably exciting effect.  He showed her the\nreadings of temperature and pulse, and forbade her to stay\nlonger than five minutes at each of her two daily visits.\nAlso, she must not bring up any topic beyond the sickroom\nitself.  One day Spenser greeted her with, \"I'll feel better,\nnow that I've got this off my mind.\"  He held out to her a\nletter.  \"Take that to George Fitzalan.  He's an old friend of\nmine--one I've done a lot for and never asked any favors of.\nHe may be able to give you something fairly good, right away.\"\n\nSusan glanced penetratingly at him, saw he had been brooding\nover the source of the money that was being spent upon him.\n\"Very well,\" said she, \"I'll go as soon as I can.\"\n\n\"Go this afternoon,\" said he with an invalid's fretfulness.\n\"And when you come this evening you can tell me how you got on.\"\n\n\"Very well.  This afternoon.  But you know, Rod, there's not a\nghost of a chance.\"\n\n\"I tell you Fitzalan's my friend.  He's got some gratitude.\nHe'll _do_ something.\"\n\n\"I don't want you to get into a mood where you'll be awfully\ndepressed if I should fail.\"\n\n\"But you'll not fail.\"\n\nIt was evident that Spenser, untaught by experience and\nflattered into exaggerating his importance by the solicitude\nand deference of doctors and nurses to a paying invalid, had\nrestored to favor his ancient enemy--optimism, the certain\ndestroyer of any man who does not shake it off.  She went away,\ndepressed and worried.  When she should come back with the only\npossible news, what would be the effect upon him--and he still\nin a critical stage?  As the afternoon must be given to\nbusiness, she decided to go straight uptown, hoping to catch\nFitzalan before he went out to lunch.  And twenty minutes after\nmaking this decision she was sitting in the anteroom of a suite\nof theatrical offices in the Empire Theater building.  The girl\nin attendance had, as usual, all the airs little people assume\nwhen they are in close, if menial, relations with a person who,\nbeing important to them, therefore fills their whole small\nhorizon.  She deigned to take in Susan's name and the letter.\nSusan seated herself at the long table and with the seeming of\ncalmness that always veiled her in her hours of greatest\nagitation, turned over the pages of the theatrical journals and\nmagazines spread about in quantity.\n\nAfter perhaps ten silent and uninterrupted minutes a man\nhurried in from the outside hall, strode toward the frosted\nglass door marked \"Private.\"  With his hand reaching for the\nknob he halted, made an impatient gesture, plumped himself down\nat the long table--at its distant opposite end.  With a sweep of\nthe arm he cleared a space wherein he proceeded to spread\npapers from his pocket and to scribble upon them furiously.\nWhen Susan happened to glance at him, his head was bent so low\nand his straw hat was tilted so far forward that she could not\nsee his face.  She observed that he was dressed attractively in\nan extremely light summer suit of homespun; his hands were\nlarge and strong and ruddy--the hands of an artist, in good\nhealth.  Her glance returned to the magazine.  After a few\nminutes she looked up.  She was startled to find that the man\nwas giving her a curious, searching inspection--and that he was\nBrent, the playwright--the same fascinating face, keen,\ncynical, amused--the same seeing eyes, that, in the Cafe Martin\nlong ago, had made her feel as if she were being read to her\nmost secret thought.  She dropped her glance.\n\nHis voice made her start.  \"It's been a long time since I've\nseen you,\" he was saying.\n\nShe looked up, not believing it possible he was addressing her.\nBut his gaze was upon her.  Thus, she had not been mistaken in\nthinking she had seen recognition in his eyes.  \"Yes,\" she\nsaid, with a faint smile.\n\n\"A longer time for you than for me,\" said he.\n\n\"A good deal has happened to me,\" she admitted.\n\n\"Are you on the stage?\"\n\n\"No.  Not yet.\"\n\nThe girl entered by way of the private door.  \"Miss Lenox--this\nway, please.\"  She saw Brent, became instantly all smiles and\nbows.  \"Oh--Mr. Fitzalan doesn't know you're here, Mr. Brent,\"\nshe cried.  Then, to Susan, \"Wait a minute.\"\n\nShe was about to reënter the private office when Brent stopped\nher with, \"Let Miss Lenox go in first.  I don't wish to see Mr.\nFitzalan yet.\"  And he stood up, took off his hat, bowed\ngravely to Susan, said, \"I'm glad to have seen you again.\"\n\nSusan, with some color forced into her old-ivory skin by\nnervousness and amazement, went into the presence of Fitzalan.\nAs the now obsequious girl closed the door behind her, she\nfound herself facing a youngish man with a remnant of hair that\nwas little more than fuzz on the top of his head.  His features\nwere sharp, aggressive, rather hard.  He might have sat for the\ntypical successful American young man of forty--so much younger\nin New York than is forty elsewhere in the United States--and so\nmuch older.  He looked at Susan with a pleasant sympathetic smile.\n\n\"So,\" said he, \"you're taking care of poor Spenser, are you?\nTell him I'll try to run down to see him.  I wish I could do\nsomething for him--something worth while, I mean.  But--his\nrequest----\n\n\"Really, I've nothing of the kind.  I couldn't possibly place\nyou--at least, not at present--perhaps, later on----\"\n\n\"I understand,\" interrupted Susan.  \"He's very ill.  It would\nhelp him greatly if you would write him a few lines, saying\nyou'll give me a place at the first vacancy, but that it may\nnot be soon.  I'll not trouble you again.  I want the letter\nsimply to carry him over the crisis.\"\n\nFitzalan hesitated, rubbed his fuzzy crown with his jeweled\nhand.  \"Tell him that,\" he said, finally.  \"I'm rather careful\nabout writing letters. . . .  Yes, say to him what you\nsuggested, as if it was from me.\"\n\n\"The letter will make all the difference between his believing\nand not believing,\" urged Susan.  \"He has great admiration and\nliking for you--thinks you would do anything for him.\"\n\nFitzalan frowned; she saw that her insistence had roused--or,\nrather, had strengthened--suspicion.  \"Really--you must excuse\nme.  What I've heard about him the past year has not----\n\n\"But, no matter, I can't do it.  You'll let me know how he's\ngetting on?  Good day.\"  And he gave her that polite yet\npositive nod of dismissal which is a necessary part of the\nequipment of men of affairs, constantly beset as they are and\never engaged in the battle to save their chief asset, time,\nfrom being wasted.\n\nSusan looked at him--a straight glance from gray eyes, a slight\nsmile hovering about her scarlet lips.  He reddened, fussed\nwith the papers before him on the desk from which he had not\nrisen.  She opened the door, closed it behind her.  Brent was\nseated with his back full to her and was busy with his\nscribbling.  She passed him, went on to the outer door.  She\nwas waiting for his voice; she knew it would come.\n\n\"Miss Lenox!\"\n\nAs she turned he was advancing.  His figure, tall and slim and\nstraight, had the ease of movement which proclaims the man who\nhas been everywhere and so is at home anywhere.  He held out a\ncard.  \"I wish to see you on business.  You can come at three\nthis afternoon?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Thanks,\" said he, bowing and returning to the table.  She went\non into the hall, the card between her fingers.  At the\nelevator, she stood staring at the name--Robert Brent--as if it\nwere an inscription in a forgotten language.  She was so\nabsorbed, so dazed that she did not ring the bell.  The car\nhappened to stop at that floor; she entered as if it were\ndark.  And, in the street, she wandered many blocks down\nBroadway before she realized where she was.\n\nShe left the elevated and walked eastward through Grand Street.\nShe was filled with a new and profound dissatisfaction.  She\nfelt like one awakening from a hypnotic trance.  The\nsurroundings, inanimate and animate, that had become endurable\nthrough custom abruptly resumed their original aspect of\nsqualor and ugliness of repulsion and tragedy.  A stranger--the\nordinary, unobservant, feebly imaginative person, going along\nthose streets would have seen nothing but tawdriness and\npoverty.  Susan, experienced, imaginative, saw _all_--saw what\nanother would have seen only after it was pointed out, and even\nthen but dimly.  And that day her vision was no longer staled\nand deadened by familiarity, but with vision fresh and with\nnerves acute.  The men--the women--and, saddest, most tragic of\nall, the children!  When she entered her room her reawakened\nsensitiveness, the keener for its long repose, for the enormous\nunconscious absorption of impressions of the life about\nher--this morbid sensitiveness of the soul a-clash with its\nenvironment reached its climax.  As she threw open the door,\nshe shrank back before the odor--the powerful, sensual, sweet\nodor of chypre so effective in covering the bad smells that\ncame up from other flats and from the noisome back yards.  The\nroom itself was neat and clean and plain, with not a few\nevidences of her personal taste--in the blending of colors, in\nthe selection of framed photographs on the walls.  The one she\nespecially liked was the largest--a nude woman lying at full\nlength, her head supported by her arm, her face gazing straight\nout of the picture, upon it a baffling expression--of sadness,\nof cynicism, of amusement perhaps, of experience, yet of\ninnocence.  It hung upon the wall opposite the door.  When she\nsaw this picture in the department store, she felt at once a\nsympathy between that woman and herself, felt she was for the\nfirst time seeing another soul like her own, one that would\nhave understood her strange sense of innocence in the midst of\nher own defiled and depraved self--a core of unsullied nature.\nEveryone else in the world would have mocked at this notion of\na something within--a true self to which all that seemed to be\nher own self was as external as her clothing; this woman of the\nphotograph would understand.  So, there she hung--Susan's one\nprized possession.\n\nThe question of dressing for this interview with Brent was\nmost important.  Susan gave it much thought before she began to\ndress, changed her mind again and again in the course of\ndressing.  Through all her vicissitudes she had never lost her\ninterest in the art of dress or her skill at it--and despite\nthe unfavorable surroundings she had steadily improved; any\nwoman anywhere would instantly have recognized her as one of\nthose few favored and envied women who know how to get together\na toilet.  She finally chose the simplest of the half dozen\nsummer dresses she had made for herself--a plain white lawn,\nwith a short skirt.  It gave her an appearance of extreme\nyouth, despite her height and the slight stoop in her\nshoulders--a mere drooping that harmonized touchingly with the\nyoung yet weary expression of her face.  To go with the dress\nshe had a large hat of black rough straw with a very little\nwhite trimming on it.  With this large black hat bewitchingly\nset upon her gracefully-done dark wavy hair, her sad, dreamy\neyes, her pallid skin, her sweet-bitter mouth with its rouged\nlips seemed to her to show at their best.  She felt that\nnothing was quite so effective for her skin as a white dress.\nIn other colors--though she did not realize--the woman of bought\nkisses showed more distinctly--never brazenly as in most of the\ngirls, but still unmistakably.  In white she took on a glamour\nof melancholy--and the human countenance is capable of no\nexpression so universally appealing as the look of melancholy\nthat suggests the sadness underlying all life, the pain that\npays for pleasure, the pain that pays and gets no pleasure, the\nsorrow of the passing of all things, the faint foreshadow of\nthe doom awaiting us all.  She washed the rouge from her lips,\nstudied the effect in the glass.  \"No,\" she said aloud,\n\"without it I feel like a hypocrite--and I don't look half so\nwell.\"  And she put the rouge on again--the scarlet dash drawn\nstartlingly across her strange, pallid face.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nAT three that afternoon she stood in the vestibule of Brent's\nsmall house in Park Avenue overlooking the oblong of green\nbetween East Thirty-seventh Street and East Thirty-eighth.  A\nmost reputable looking Englishman in evening dress opened the\ndoor; from her reading and her theater-going she knew that\nthis was a butler.  He bowed her in.  The entire lower floor\nwas given to an entrance hall, done in plain black walnut,\nalmost lofty of ceiling, and with a grand stairway leading to\nthe upper part of the house.  There was a huge fireplace to\nthe right; a mirror filled the entire back wall; a broad low\nseat ran all round the room.  In one corner, an enormous urn\nof dark pottery; in another corner, a suit of armor, the\nhelmet, the breastplate and the gauntlets set with gold of\nancient lackluster.\n\nThe butler left her there and ascended the polished but\ndead-finished stairway noiselessly.  Susan had never before\nbeen in so grand a room.  The best private house she had ever\nseen was Wright's in Sutherland; and while everybody else in\nSutherland thought it magnificent, she had felt that there was\nsomething wrong, what she had not known.  The grandiose New\nYork hotels and restaurants were more showy and more\npretentious far than this interior of Brent's.  But her\nunerring instinct of those born with good taste knew at first\nview of them that they were simply costly; there were\nbeautiful things in them, fine carvings and paintings and\ntapestries, but personality was lacking.  And without\npersonality there can be no unity; without unity there can be\nno harmony--and without harmony, no beauty.\n\nLooking round her now, she had her first deep draught of\nesthetic delight in interior decoration.  She loved this quiet\ndignity, this large simplicity--nothing that obtruded, nothing\nthat jarred, everything on the same scale of dark coloring and\nlarge size.  She admired the way the mirror, without pretense\nof being anything but a mirror, enhanced the spaciousness of\nthe room and doubled the pleasure it gave by offering another\nand different view of it.\n\nLast of all Susan caught sight of herself--a slim, slightly\nstooped figure, its white dress and its big black hat with\nwhite trimmings making it stand out strongly against the\nrather somber background.  In a curiously impersonal way her\nown sad, wistful face interested her.  A human being's face is\na summary of his career.  No man can realize at a thought what\nhe is, can epitomize in just proportion what has been made of\nhim by experience of the multitude of moments of which life is\ncomposed.  But in some moods and in some lights we do get such\nan all-comprehending view of ourselves in looking at our own\nfaces.  As she had instinctively felt, there was a world of\nmeaning in the contrast between her pensive brow above\nmelancholy eyes and the blood-red line of her rouged lips.\n\nThe butler descended.  \"Mr. Brent is in his library, on the\nfourth floor,\" said he.  \"Will you kindly step this way, ma'am?\"\n\nInstead of indicating the stairway, he went to the panel next\nthe chimney piece.  She saw that it was a hidden door\nadmitting to an elevator.  She entered; the door closed; the\nelevator ascended rapidly.  When it came to a stop the door\nopened and she was facing Brent.\n\n\"Thank you for coming,\" said he, with almost formal courtesy.\n\nFor all her sudden shyness, she cast a quick but seeing look\nround.  It was an overcast day; the soft floods of liquid\nlight--the beautiful light of her beloved City of the\nSun--poured into the big room through an enormous window of\nclear glass which formed the entire north wall.  Round the\nother walls from floor almost to lofty ceiling were books in\nsolid rows; not books with ornamental bindings, but books for\nuse, books that had been and were being used.  By way of\nfurniture there were an immense lounge, wide and long and\ndeep, facing the left chimney piece, an immense table desk\nfacing the north light, three great chairs with tall backs,\none behind the table, one near the end of the table, the third\nin the corner farthest from the window; a grand piano, open,\nwith music upon its rack, and a long carved seat at its\nkeyboard.  The huge window had a broad sill upon which was\nbuilt a generous window garden fresh and lively with bright\nflowers.  The woodwork, the ceiling, the furniture were of\nmahogany.  The master of this splendid simplicity was dressed\nin a blue house suit of some summer material like linen.  He\nwas smoking a cigarette, and offered her one from the great\ncarved wood box filled with them on the table desk.\n\n\"Thanks,\" said she.  And when she had lighted it and was\nseated facing him as he sat at his desk, she felt almost at\nher ease.  After all, while his gaze was penetrating, it was\nalso understanding; we do not mind being unmasked if the\nunmasker at once hails us as brother.  Brent's eyes seemed to say\nto her, \"Human!--like me.\"  She smoked and let her gaze wander\nfrom her books to window garden, from window garden to piano.\n\n\"You play?\" said he.\n\n\"A very little.  Enough for accompaniments to simple songs.\"\n\n\"You sing?\"\n\n\"Simple songs.  I've had but a few lessons from a small-town teacher.\"\n\n\"Let me hear.\"\n\nShe went to the piano, laid her cigarette in a tray ready\nbeside the music rack.  She gave him the \"Gipsy Queen,\" which\nshe liked because it expressed her own passion of revolt\nagainst restraints of every conventional kind and her love for\nthe open air and open sky.  He somehow took away all feeling\nof embarrassment; she felt so strongly that he understood and\nwas big enough not to have it anywhere in him to laugh at\nanything sincere.  When she finished she resumed her cigarette\nand returned to the chair near his.\n\n\"It's as I thought,\" said he.  \"Your voice can be trained--to\nspeak, I mean.  I don't know as to its singing value. . . .\nHave you good health?\"\n\n\"I never have even colds.  Yes, I'm strong.\"\n\n\"You'll need it.\"\n\n\"I have needed it,\" said she.  Into her face came the sad, bitter\nexpression with its curious relief of a faint cynical smile.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair and looked at her through a cloud\nof smoke.  She saw that his eyes were not gray, as she had\nthought, but brown, a hazel brown with points of light\nsparkling in the irises and taking away all the suggestion of\nweakness and sentimentality that makes pure brown eyes\nunsatisfactory in a man.  He said slowly:\n\n\"When I saw you--in the Martin--you were on the way down.  You\nwent, I see.\"\n\nShe nodded.  \"I'm still there.\"\n\n\"You like it?  You wish to stay?\"\n\nShe shook her head smilingly.  \"No, but I can stay if it's\nnecessary.  I've discovered that I've got the health and the\nnerves for anything.\"\n\n\"That's a great discovery. . . .  Well, you'll soon be on your\nway up. . . .  Do you wish to know why I spoke to you this\nmorning?--Why I remembered you?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because of the expression of your eyes--when your face is in repose.\"\n\nShe felt no shyness--and no sense of necessity of responding\nto a compliment, for his tone forbade any thought of flattery.\nShe lowered her gaze to conceal the thoughts his words\nbrought--the memories of the things that had caused her eyes\nto look as Rod and now Brent said.\n\n\"Such an expression,\" the playwright went on, \"must mean\ncharacter.  I am sick and tired of the vanity of these\nactresses who can act just enough never to be able to learn to\nact well.  I'm going to try an experiment with you.  I've\ntried it several times but--No matter.  I'm not discouraged.\nI never give up. . . .  Can you stand being alone?\"\n\n\"I spend most of my time alone.  I prefer it.\"\n\n\"I thought so.  Yes--you'll do.  Only the few who can stand\nbeing alone ever get anywhere.  Everything worth while is done\nalone.  The big battle--it isn't fought in the field, but by\nthe man sitting alone in his tent, working it all out.  The\nbridge--the tunnel through the great mountains--the\nrailway--the huge business enterprise--all done by the man\nalone, thinking, plotting to the last detail.  It's the same\nway with the novel, the picture, the statue, the play--writing\nit, acting it--all done by someone alone, shut in with his\nimagination and his tools.  I saw that you were one of the\nlonely ones.  All you need is a chance.  You'd surely get it,\nsooner or later.  Perhaps I can bring it a little sooner. . . .\nHow much do you need to live on?\"\n\n\"I must have fifty dollars a week--if I go on at--as I am now.\nIf you wish to take all my time--then, forty.\"\n\nHe smiled in a puzzled way.\n\n\"The police,\" she explained.  \"I need ten----\"\n\n\"Certainly--certainly,\" cried he.  \"I understand--perfectly.\nHow stupid of me!  I'll want all your time.  So it's to be\nforty dollars a week.  When can you begin?\"\n\nSusan reflected.  \"I can't go into anything that'll mean a\nlong time,\" she said.  \"I'm waiting for a man--a friend of\nmine to get well.  Then we're going to do something together.\"\n\nBrent made an impatient gesture.  \"An actor?  Well, I suppose\nI can get him something to do.  But I don't want you to be\nunder the influence of any of these absurd creatures who think\nthey know what acting is--when they merely know how to dress\nthemselves in different suits of clothes, and strut themselves\nabout the stage.  They'd rather die than give up their own\nfeeble, foolish little identities.  I'll see that your actor\nfriend is taken care of, but you must keep away from him--for\nthe time at least.\"\n\n\"He's all I've got.  He's an old friend.\"\n\n\"You--care for him?\"\n\n\"I used to.  And lately I found him again--after we had been\nseparated a long time.  We're going to help each other up.\"\n\n\"Oh--he's down and out oh?  Why?\"\n\n\"Drink--and hard luck.\"\n\n\"Not hard luck.  That helps a man.  It has helped you.  It has\nmade you what you are.\"\n\n\"What am I?\" asked Susan.\n\nBrent smiled mysteriously.  \"That's what we're going to find\nout,\" said he.  \"There's no human being who has ever had a\nfuture unless he or she had a past--and the severer the past\nthe more splendid the future.\"\n\nSusan was attending with all her senses.  This man was putting\ninto words her own inarticulate instincts.\n\n\"A past,\" he went on in his sharp, dogmatic way, \"either\nbreaks or makes.  You go into the crucible a mere ore, a\npossibility.  You come out slag or steel.\"  He was standing\nnow, looking down at her with quizzical eyes.  \"You're about\ndue to leave the pot,\" said he.\n\n\"And I've hopes that you're steel.  If not----\"  He shrugged\nhis shoulders--\"You'll have had forty a week for your time,\nand I'll have gained useful experience.\"\n\nSusan gazed at him as if she doubted her eyes and ears.\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" she presently inquired.\n\n\"Learn the art of acting--which consists of two parts.  First,\nyou must learn to act--thousands of the profession do that.\nSecond, you must learn not to act--and so far I know there\naren't a dozen in the whole world who've got that far along.\nI've written a play I think well of.  I want to have it done\nproperly--it, and several other plays I intend to write.  I'm\ngoing to give you a chance to become famous--better still, great.\"\n\nSusan looked at him incredulously.  \"Do you know who I am?\"\nshe asked at last.\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nHer eyes lowered, the faintest tinge of red changed the\namber-white pallor of her cheeks, her bosom rose and\nfell quickly.\n\n\"I don't mean,\" he went on, \"that I know any of the details of\nyour experience.  I only know the results as they are written\nin your face.  The details are unimportant.  When I say I know\nwho you are, I mean I know that you are a woman who has\nsuffered, whose heart has been broken by suffering, but not\nher spirit.  Of where you came from or how you've lived, I\nknow nothing.  And it's none of my business--no more than it's\nthe public's business where _I_ came from and how I've learned\nto write plays.\"\n\nWell, whether he was guessing any part of the truth or all of\nit, certainly what she had said about the police and now this\nsweeping statement of his attitude toward her freed her of the\nnecessity of disclosing herself.  She eagerly tried to dismiss\nthe thoughts that had been making her most uneasy.  She said:\n\n\"You think I can learn to act?\"\n\n\"That, of course,\" replied he.  \"Any intelligent person can\nlearn to act--and also most persons who have no more\nintelligence in their heads than they have in their feet.\nI'll guarantee you some sort of career.  What I'm interested\nto find out is whether you can learn _not_ to act.  I believe\nyou can.  But----\"  He laughed in self-mockery.  \"I've made several\nabsurd mistakes in that direction. . . .  You have led a life in\nwhich most women become the cheapest sort of liars--worse\nliars even than is the usual respectable person, because they\nhaven't the restraint of fearing loss of reputation.  Why is\nit you have not become a liar?\"\n\nSusan laughed.  \"I'm sure I don't know.  Perhaps because lying\nis such a tax on the memory.  May I have another cigarette?\"\n\nHe held the match for her.  \"You don't paint--except your\nlips,\" he went on, \"though you have no color.  And you don't\nwear cheap finery.  And while you use a strong scent, it's not\none of the cheap and nasty kind--it's sensual without being\nslimy.  And you don't use the kind of words one always hears\nin your circle.\"\n\nSusan looked immensely relieved.  \"Then you _do_ know who I\nam!\" she cried.\n\n\"You didn't suppose I thought you fresh from a fashionable\nboarding school, did you?  I'd hardly look there for an\nactress who could act.  You've got\nexperience--experience--experience--written all over your\nface--sadly, satirically, scornfully, gayly, bitterly.  And\nwhat I want is experience--not merely having been through\nthings, but having been through them understandingly.  You'll\nhelp me in my experiment?\"\n\nHe looked astonished, then irritated, when the girl, instead\nof accepting eagerly, drew back in her chair and seemed to be\ndebating.  His irritation showed still more plainly when she\nfinally said:\n\n\"That depends on him.  And he--he thinks you don't like him.\"\n\n\"What's his name?\" said Brent in his abrupt, intense fashion.\n\"What's his name?\"\n\n\"Spenser--Roderick Spenser.\"\n\nBrent looked vague.\n\n\"He used to be on the _Herald_.  He writes plays.\"\n\n\"Oh--yes.  I remember.  He's a weak fool.\"\n\nSusan abruptly straightened, an ominous look in eyes and brow.\n\nBrent made an impatient gesture.  \"Beg pardon.  Why be\nsensitive about him?  Obviously because you know I'm right.\nI said fool, not ass.  He's clever, but ridiculously vain.  I\ndon't dislike him.  I don't care anything about him--or about\nanybody else in the world.  No man does who amounts to\nanything.  With a career it's as Jesus said--leave father and\nmother, husband and wife--land, ox everything--and follow it.\"\n\n\"What for?\" said Susan.\n\n\"To save your soul!  To be a somebody; to be strong.  To be\nable to give to anybody and everybody--whatever they need.  To\nbe happy.\"\n\n\"Are you happy?\"\n\n\"No,\" he admitted.  \"But I'm growing in that direction. . . .\nDon't waste yourself on Stevens--I beg pardon, Spenser.\nYou're bigger than that.  He's a small man with large\ndreams--a hopeless misfit.  Small dreams for small men; large\ndreams for--\" he laughed--\"you and me--our sort.\"\n\nSusan echoed his laugh, but faint-heartedly.  \"I've watched\nyour name in the papers,\" she said, sincerely unconscious of\nflattery.  \"I've seen you grow more and more famous.  But--if\nthere had been anything in me, would I have gone down and down?\"\n\n\"How old are you?\"\n\n\"About twenty-one.\"\n\n\"Only twenty-one and that look in your face!  Magnificent!  I\ndon't believe I'm to be disappointed this time.  You ask why\nyou've gone down!  You haven't.  You've gone _through_.\"\n\n\"Down,\" she insisted, sadly.\n\n\"Nonsense!  The soot'll rub off the steel.\"\n\nShe lifted her head eagerly.  Her own secret thought put into words.\n\n\"You can't make steel without soot and dirt.  You can't make\nanything without dirt.  That's why the nice, prim, silly\nworld's full of cabinets exhibiting little chips of raw\nmaterial polished up neatly in one or two spots.  That's why\nthere are so few men and women--and those few have had to make\nthemselves, or are made by accident.  You're an accident, I\nsuppose.  The women who amount to anything usually are.  The\nlast actress I tried to do anything with might have become a\nsomebody if it hadn't been for one thing:  She had a hankering\nfor respectability--a yearning to be a society person--to be\nthought well of by society people.  It did for her.\"\n\n\"I'll not sink on that rock,\" said Susan cheerfully.\n\n\"No secret longing for social position?\"\n\n\"None.  Even if I would, I couldn't.\"\n\n\"That's one heavy handicap out of the way.  But I'll not let\nmyself begin to hope until I find out whether you've got\nincurable and unteachable vanity.  If you have--then, no hope.\nIf you haven't--there's a fighting chance.\"\n\n\"You forget my compact,\" Susan reminded him.\n\n\"Oh--the lover--Spenser.\"\n\nBrent reflected, strolled to the big window, his hands deep in\nhis pockets.  Susan took advantage of his back to give way to\nher own feelings of utter amazement and incredulity.  She\ncertainly was not dreaming.  And the man gazing out at the\nwindow was certainly flesh and blood--a great man, if voluble\nand eccentric.  Perhaps to act and speak as one pleased was\none of the signs of greatness, one of its perquisites.  Was\nhe amusing himself with her?  Was he perchance taken with\nher physically and employing these extraordinary methods as\nways of approach?  She had seen many peculiarities of\nsex-approach in men--some grotesque, many terrible, all beyond\ncomprehension.  Was this another such?\n\nHe wheeled suddenly, surprised her eyes upon him.  He burst\nout laughing, and she felt that he had read her thoughts.\nHowever, he merely said:\n\n\"Have you anything to suggest--about Spenser?\"\n\n\"I can't even tell him of your offer now.  He's very ill--and\nsensitive about you.\"\n\n\"About me?  How ridiculous!  I'm always coming across men I\ndon't know who are full of venom toward me.  I suppose he\nthinks I crowded him.  No matter.  You're sure you're not\nfancying yourself in love with him?\"\n\n\"No, I am not in love with him.  He has changed--and so have I.\"\n\nHe smiled at her.  \"Especially in the last hour?\" he suggested.\n\n\"I had changed before that.  I had been changing right along.\nBut I didn't realize it fully until you talked with me--no,\nuntil after you gave me your card this morning.\"\n\n\"You saw a chance--a hope--eh?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"And at once became all nerves and courage. . . .  As to\nSpenser--I'll have some play carpenter sent to collaborate\nwith him and set him up in the play business.  You know it's a\nbusiness as well as an art.  And the chromos sell better than\nthe oil paintings--except the finest ones.  It's my chromos\nthat have earned me the means and the leisure to try oils.\"\n\n\"He'd never consent.  He's very proud.\"\n\n\"Vain, you mean.  Pride will consent to anything as a means to an\nend.  It's vanity that's squeamish and haughty.  He needn't know.\"\n\n\"But I couldn't discuss any change with him until he's much better.\"\n\n\"I'll send the play carpenter to him--get Fitzalan to send one\nof his carpenters.\"  Brent smiled.  \"You don't think _he_'ll\nhang back because of the compact, do you?\"\n\nSusan flushed painfully.  \"No,\" she admitted in a low voice.\n\nBrent was still smiling at her, and the smile was cynical.\nBut his tone soothed where his words would have wounded, as he\nwent on:  \"A man of his sort--an average,\n'there-are-two-kinds-of-women, good-and-bad' sort of man--has\nbut one use for a woman of your sort.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Do you mind it?\"\n\n\"Not much.  I'd not mind it at all if I felt that I was somebody.\"\n\nBrent put his hand on her shoulder.  \"You'll do, Miss Lenox,\"\nhe said with quiet heartiness.  \"You may not be so big a\nsomebody as you and I would like.  But you'll count as one,\nall right.\"\n\nShe looked at him with intense appeal in her eyes.  \"Why?\" she\nsaid earnestly.  \"_Why_ do you do this?\"\n\nHe smiled gravely down at her--as gravely as Brent could\nsmile--with the quizzical suggestion never absent from his\nhandsome face, so full of life and intelligence.  \"I've been\nobserving your uneasiness,\" said he.  \"Now listen.  It would\nbe impossible for you to judge me, to understand me.  You are\nyoung and as yet small.  I am forty, and have lived\ntwenty-five of my forty years intensely.  So, don't fall into\nthe error of shallow people and size me up by your own foolish\nlittle standards.  Do you see what I mean?\"\n\nSusan's candid face revealed her guilt.  \"Yes,\" said she,\nrather humbly.\n\n\"I see you do understand,\" said he.  \"And that's a good sign.\nMost people, hearing what I said, would have disregarded it as\nmerely my vanity, would have gone on with their silly judging,\nwould have set me down as a conceited ass who by some accident\nhad got a reputation.  But to proceed--I have not chosen you\non impulse.  Long and patient study has made me able to judge\ncharacter by the face, as a horse dealer can judge horses by\nlooking at them.  I don't need to read every line of a book to\nknow whether it's wise or foolish, worth while or not.  I\ndon't need to know a human being for years or for hours or for\nminutes even, before I can measure certain things.  I measured\nyou.  It's like astronomy.  An astronomer wants to get the\norbit of a star.  He takes its position twice--and from the\ntwo observations he can calculate the orbit to the inch.  I've\ngot three observations of your orbit.  Enough--and to spare.\"\n\n\"I shan't misunderstand again,\" said Susan.\n\n\"One thing more,\" insisted Brent.  \"In our relations, we are\nto be not man and woman, but master and pupil.  I shan't waste\nyour time with any--other matters.\"\n\nIt was Susan's turn to laugh.  \"That's your polite way of\nwarning me not to waste any of your time with--other matters.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" conceded he.  \"A man in my position--a man in any\nsort of position, for that matter--is much annoyed by women\ntrying to use their sex with him.  I wished to make it clear\nat the outset that----\"\n\n\"That I could gain nothing by neglecting the trade of actress\nfor the trade of woman,\" interrupted Susan.  \"I understand\nperfectly.\"\n\nHe put out his hand.  \"I see that at least we'll get on\ntogether.  I'll have Fitzalan send the carpenter to your\nfriend at once.\"\n\n\"Today!\" exclaimed Susan, in surprise and delight.\n\n\"Why not?\"  He arranged paper and pen.  \"Sit here and write\nSpenser's address, and your own.  Your salary begins with\ntoday.  I'll have my secretary mail you a check.  And as soon\nas I can see you again, I'll send you a telegram.\nMeanwhile--\" He rummaged among a lot of paper bound plays on\nthe table \"Here's 'Cavalleria Rusticana.'  Read it with a view\nto yourself as either _Santuzzao_ or _Lola_.  Study her first\nentrance--what you would do with it.  Don't be frightened.  I\nexpect nothing from you--nothing whatever.  I'm glad you know\nnothing about acting.  You'll have the less to unlearn.\"\n\nThey had been moving towards the elevator.  He shook hands\nagain and, after adjusting the mechanism for the descent,\nclosed the door.  As it was closing she saw in his expression\nthat his mind had already dismissed her for some one of the\nmany other matters that crowded his life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nTHE Susan Lenox who left Delancey Street at half past two that\nafternoon to call upon Robert Brent was not the Susan Lenox\nwho returned to Delancey Street at half-past five.  A man is\nwandering, lost in a cave, is groping this way and that in\nabsolute darkness, with flagging hope and fainting\nstrength--has reached the point where he wonders at his own\nfolly in keeping on moving--is persuading himself that the\nsensible thing would be to lie down and give up.  He sees a\ngleam of light.  Is it a reality?  Is it an illusion--one more\nof the illusions that have lured him on and on?  He does not\nknow; but instantly a fire sweeps through him, warming his\ndying strength into vigor.\n\nSo it was with Susan.\n\nThe pariah class--the real pariah class--does not consist of\nmerely the women formally put beyond the pale for violations\nof conventional morality and the men with the brand of thief\nor gambler upon them.  Our social, our industrial system has\nmade it far vaster.  It includes almost the whole\npopulation--all those who sell body or brain or soul in an\nuncertain market for uncertain hire, to gain the day's food\nand clothing, the night's shelter.  This vast mass floats\nhither and yon on the tides and currents of destiny.  Now it\nhalts, resting sluggishly in a dead calm; again it moves,\nsometimes slowly, sometimes under the lash of tempest.  But it\nis ever the same vast inertia, with no particle of it\npossessing an aim beyond keeping afloat and alive.  Susan had\nbeen an atom, a spray of weed, in this Sargasso Sea.\n\nIf you observe a huge, unwieldy crowd so closely packed that\nnothing can be done with it and it can do nothing with itself,\nyou will note three different types.  There are the entirely\ninert--and they make up most of the crowd.  They do not\nresist; they helplessly move this way and that as the chance\nwaves of motion prompt.  Of this type is the overwhelming\nmajority of the human race.  Here and there in the mass you\nwill see examples of a second type.  These are individuals who\nare restive and resentful under the sense of helplessness and\nimpotence.  They struggle now gently, now furiously.  They\nthrust backward or forward or to one side.  They thresh about.\nBut nothing comes of their efforts beyond a brief agitation,\nsoon dying away in ripples.  The inertia of the mass and their\nown lack of purpose conquer them.  Occasionally one of these\ngrows so angry and so violent that the surrounding inertia\nquickens into purpose--the purpose of making an end of this\nagitation which is serving only to increase the general\ndiscomfort.  And the agitator is trampled down, disappears,\nperhaps silently, perhaps with groan or shriek.  Continue to\nlook at this crowd, so pitiful, so terrible, such a melancholy\nwaste of incalculable power--continue to observe and you may\nchance upon an example of the third type.  You are likely at\nfirst to confuse the third type with the second, for they seem\nto be much alike.  Here and there, of the resentful\nstrugglers, will be one whose resentment is intelligent.  He\nstruggles, but it is not aimless struggle.  He has seen or\nsuspected in a definite direction a point where he would be\nmore or less free, perhaps entirely free.  He realizes how he\nis hemmed in, realizes how difficult, how dangerous, will be\nhis endeavor to get to that point.  And he proceeds to try to\nminimize or overcome the difficulties, the dangers.  He\nstruggles now gently, now earnestly, now violently--but always\ntoward his fixed objective.  He is driven back, to one side,\nis almost overwhelmed.  He causes commotions that threaten to\nengulf him, and must pause or retreat until they have calmed.\nYou may have to watch him long before you discover that, where\nother strugglers have been aimless, he aims and resolves.  And\nlittle by little he gains, makes progress toward his goal--and\nonce in a long while one such reaches that goal.  It is\ntriumph, success.\n\nSusan, young, inexperienced, dazed; now too despondent, now\ntoo hopeful; now too gentle and again too infuriated--Susan\nhad been alternating between inertia and purposeless struggle.\nBrent had given her the thing she lacked--had given her a\ndefinite, concrete, tangible purpose.  He had shown her the\nplace where, if she should arrive, she might be free of that\nhideous slavery of the miserable mass; and he had inspired her\nwith the hope that she could reach it.\n\nAnd that was the Susan Lenox who came back to the little room\nin Delancey Street at half-past five.\n\nCuriously, while she was thinking much about Brent, she was\nthinking even more about Burlingham--about their long talks on\nthe show boat and in their wanderings in Louisville and\nCincinnati.  His philosophy, his teachings--the wisdom he had,\nbut was unable to apply--began to come back to her.  It was\nnot strange that she should remember it, for she had admired\nhim intensely and had listened to his every word, and she was\nthen at the time when the memory takes its clearest and\nstrongest impressions.  The strangeness lay in the suddenness\nwith which Burlingham, so long dead, suddenly came to life,\nchanged from a sad and tender memory to a vivid possibility,\nadvising her, helping her, urging her on.\n\nClara, dressed to go to dinner with her lover, was waiting to\narrange about their meeting to make together the usual rounds\nin the evening.  \"I've got an hour before I'm due at the\nhospital,\" said Susan.  \"Let's go down to Kelly's for a drink.\"\n\nWhile they were going and as they sat in the clean little back\nroom of Kelly's well ordered and select corner saloon, Clara\ngave her all the news she had gathered in an afternoon of\nvisits among their acquaintances--how, because of a\nneighborhood complaint, there was to be a fake raid on\nGussie's opium joint at midnight; that Mazie had caught a\nfrightful fever; and that Nettie was dying in Governeur of the\nstab in the stomach her lover had given her at a ball three\nnights before; that the police had raised the tariff for\nsporting houses, and would collect seventy-five and a hundred\na month protection money where the charge had been twenty-five\nand fifty--the plea was that the reformers, just elected and\nhoping for one term only, were compelling a larger fund from\nvice than the old steady year-in-and-year-out ruling crowd.\n\"And they may raise _us_ to fifteen a week,\" said Clara,\n\"though I doubt it.  They'll not cut off their nose to spite\ntheir face.  If they raised the rate for the streets they'd\ndrive two-thirds of the girls back to the factories and sweat\nshops.  You're not listening, Lorna.  What's up?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Your fellow's not had a relapse?\"\n\n\"No--nothing.\"\n\n\"Need some money?  I can lend you ten.  I did have twenty, but\nI gave Sallie and that little Jew girl who's her side partner\nten for the bail bondsman.  They got pinched last night for not\npaying up to the police.  They've gone crazy about that prize\nfighter--at least, he thinks he is--that Joe O'Mara, and\nthey're giving him every cent they make.  It's funny about\nSallie.  She's a Catholic and goes to mass regular.  And she\nkeeps straight on Sunday--no money'll tempt her--I've seen it\ntried.  Do you want the ten?\"\n\n\"No.  I've got plenty.\"\n\n\"We must look in at that Jolly Rovers' ball tonight.  There'll\nbe a lot of fellows with money there.\n\n\"We can sure pull off something pretty good.  Anyhow, we'll\nhave fun.  But you don't care for the dances.  Well, they are\na waste of time.  And because the men pay for a few bum drinks\nand dance with a girl, they don't want to give up anything\nmore.  How's she to live, I want to know?\"\n\n\"Would you like to get out of this, Clara?\" interrupted Susan,\ncoming out of her absent-mindedness.\n\n\"Would I!  But what's the use of talking?\"\n\n\"But I mean, would you _really?_\"\n\n\"Oh--if there was something better.  But is there?  I don't\nsee how I'd be as well off, respectable.  As I said to the\nrescue woman, what is there in it for a 'reclaimed' girl, as\nthey call it?  When they ask a man to reform they can offer\nhim something--and he can go on up and up.  But not for girls.\nNothing doing but charity and pity and the second table and\nthe back door.  I can make more money at this and have a\nbetter time, as long as my looks last.  And I've turned down\nalready a couple of chances to marry--men that wouldn't have\nlooked at me if I'd been in a store or a factory or living\nout.  I may marry.\"\n\n\"Don't do that,\" said Susan.  \"Marriage makes brutes of men,\nand slaves of women.\"\n\n\"You speak as if you knew.\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Susan, in a tone that forbade question.\n\n\"I ain't exactly stuck on the idea myself,\" pursued Clara.\n\"And if I don't, why when my looks are gone, where am I worse\noff than I'd be at the same age as a working girl?  If I have\nto get a job then, I can get it--and I'll not be broken down\nlike the respectable women at thirty--those that work or those\nthat slop round boozing and neglecting their children while\ntheir husbands work.  Of course, there's chances against you\nin this business.  But so there is in every business.  Suppose\nI worked in a factory and lost a leg in the machinery, like\nthat girl of Mantell, the bricklayer's?  Suppose I get an\nawful disease--to hear some people talk you'd think there\nwasn't any chances of death or horrible diseases at\nrespectable work.  Why, how could anybody be worse off than if\nthey got lung trouble and boils as big as your fist like those\ngirls over in the tobacco factory?\"\n\n\"You needn't tell me about work,\" said Susan.  \"The streets\nare full of wrecks from work--and the hospitals--and the\ngraveyard over on the Island.  You can always go to that\nslavery.  But I mean a respectable life, with everything better.\"\n\n\"Has one of those swell women from uptown been after you?\"\n\n\"No.  This isn't a pious pipe dream.\"\n\n\"You sound like it.  One of them swell silk smarties got at me\nwhen I was in the hospital with the fever.  She was a\nbird--she was.  She handed me a line of grand talk, and I,\nbeing sort of weak with sickness, took it in.  Well, when she\ngot right down to business, what did she want me to do?  Be a\ndressmaker or a lady's maid.  Me work twelve, fourteen, God\nknows how many hours--be too tired to have any fun--travel\nround with dead ones--be a doormat for a lot of cheap people\nthat are tryin' to make out they ain't human like the rest of\nus.  _Me!_  And when I said, 'No, thank you,' what do you think?\"\n\n\"Did she offer to get you a good home in the country?\" said Susan.\n\n\"That was it.  The _country!_  The nerve of her!  But I called\nher bluff, all right, all right.  I says to her, 'Are you\ngoing to the country to live?'  And she reared at _me_ daring\nto question _her_, and said she wasn't.  'You'd find it dead\nslow, wouldn't you?' says I.  And she kind o' laughed and\nlooked almost human.  'Then,' says I, 'no more am I going to the\ncountry.  I'll take my chances in little old New York,' I says.\"\n\n\"I should think so!\" exclaimed Susan.\n\n\"I'd like to be respectable, if I could afford it.  But\nthere's nothing in that game for poor girls unless they\nhaven't got no looks to sell and have to sell the rest of\nthemselves for some factory boss to get rich off of while they\nget poorer and weaker every day.  And when they say 'God' to\nme, I say, 'Who's he?  He must be somebody that lives up on\nFifth Avenue.  We ain't seen him down our way.'\"\n\n\"I mean, go on the stage,\" resumed Susan.\n\n\"I wouldn't mind, if I could get in right.  Everything in this\nworld depends on getting in right.  I was born four flights up\nin a tenement, and I've been in wrong ever since.\"\n\n\"I was in wrong from the beginning, too,\" said Susan,\nthoughtfully.  \"In wrong--that's it exactly.\"  Clara's eyes\nagain became eager with the hope of a peep into the mystery of\nSusan's origin.  But Susan went on, \"Yes, I've always been in\nwrong.  Always.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" declared Clara.  \"You've got education--and\nmanners--and ladylike instincts.  I'm at home here.  I was\nnever so well off in my life.  I'm, you might say, on my way\nup in the world.  Most of us girls are--like the fellow that\nain't got nothing to eat or no place to sleep and gets into\njail--he's better off, ain't he?  But you--you don't belong\nhere at all.\"\n\n\"I belong anywhere--and everywhere--and nowhere,\" said Susan.\n\"Yes, I belong here.  I've got a chance uptown.  If it pans\nout, I'll let you in.\"\n\nClara looked at her wistfully.  Clara had a wicked temper when\nshe was in liquor, and had the ordinary human proneness to\nlying, to mischievous gossip, and to utter laziness.  The life\nshe led, compelling cleanliness and neatness and a certain\namount of thrift under penalty of instant ruin, had done her\nmuch good in saving her from going to pieces and becoming the\nordinary sloven and drag on the energies of some man.\n\"Lorna,\" she now said, \"I do believe you like me a little.\"\n\"More than that,\" Susan assured her.  \"You've saved me from\nbeing hard-hearted.  I must go to the hospital.  So long!\"\n\n\"How about this evening?\" asked Clara.\n\n\"I'm staying in.  I've got something to do.\"\n\n\"Well--I may be home early--unless I go to the ball.\"\n\nSusan was refused admittance at the hospital.  Spenser, they\nsaid, had received a caller, had taxed his strength enough for\nthe day.  Nor would it be worth while to return in the\nmorning.  The same caller was coming again.  Spenser had said\nshe was to come in the afternoon.  She received this\ncheerfully, yet not without a certain sense of hurt--which,\nhowever, did not last long.\n\nWhen she was admitted to Spenser the following afternoon, she\nfaced him guiltily--for the thoughts Brent had set to bubbling\nand boiling in her.  And her guilt showed in the tone of her\ngreeting, in the reluctance and forced intensity of her kiss\nand embrace.  She had compressed into the five most receptive\nyears of a human being's life an experience that was, for one\nof her intelligence and education, equal to many times five\nyears of ordinary life.  And this experience had developed her\ninstinct for concealing her deep feelings into a fixed habit.\nBut it had not made her a liar--had not robbed her of her\nfundamental courage and self-respect which made her shrink in\ndisdain from deceiving anyone who seemed to her to have the\nright to frankness.  Spenser, she felt as always, had that\nright--this, though he had not been frank with her; still,\nthat was a matter for his own conscience and did not affect\nher conscience as to what was courageous and honorable toward\nhim.  So, had he been observing, he must have seen that\nsomething was wrong.  But he was far too excited about his own\naffairs to note her.\n\n\"My luck's turned!\" cried he, after kissing her with\nenthusiasm.  \"Fitzalan has sent Jack Sperry to me, and we're\nto collaborate on a play.  I told you Fitz was the real thing.\"\n\nSusan turned hastily away to hide her telltale face.\n\n\"Who's Sperry?\" asked she, to gain time for self-control.\n\n\"Oh, He's a play-smith--and a bear at it.  He has knocked\ntogether half a dozen successes.  He'll supply the trade\nexperience that I lack, and Fitzalan will be sure to put on\nour piece.\"\n\n\"You're a lot better--aren't you?\"\n\n\"Better?  I'm almost well.\"\n\nHe certainly had made a sudden stride toward health.  By way\nof doing something progressive he had had a shave, and that\nhad restored the look of youth to his face--or, rather, had\nuncovered it.  A strong, handsome face it was--much handsomer\nthan Brent's--and with the subtle, moral weakness of\noptimistic vanity well concealed.  Yes, much handsomer than\nBrent's, which wasn't really handsome at all--yet was superbly\nhandsomer, also--the handsomeness that comes from being\nthrough and through a somebody.  She saw again why she had\ncared for Rod so deeply; but she also saw why she could not\ncare again, at least not in that same absorbed, self-effacing\nway.  Physical attraction--yes.  And a certain remnant of the\nfeeling of comradeship, too.  But never again utter belief,\nworshipful admiration--or any other degree of belief or\nadmiration beyond the mild and critical.  She herself had\ngrown.  Also, Brent's penetrating and just analysis of Spenser\nhad put clearly before her precisely what he was--precisely\nwhat she herself had been vaguely thinking of him.\n\nAs he talked on and on of Sperry's visit and the new projects,\nshe listened, looking at his character in the light Brent had\nturned upon it--Brent who had in a few brief moments turned\nsuch floods of light upon so many things she had been seeing\ndimly or not at all.  Moderate prosperity and moderate\nadversity bring out the best there is in a man; the extreme of\neither brings out his worst.  The actual man is the best there\nis in him, and not the worst, but it is one of the tragedies\nof life that those who have once seen his worst ever afterward\nhave sense of it chiefly, and cannot return to the feeling\nthey had for him when his worst was undreamed of.  \"I'm not in\nlove with Brent,\" thought Susan.  \"But having known him, I\ncan't ever any more care for Rod.  He seems small beside\nBrent--and he _is_ small.\"\n\nSpenser in his optimistic dreaming aloud had reached a point\nwhere it was necessary to assign Susan a role in his dazzling\ncareer.  \"You'll not have to go on the stage,\" said he.  \"I'll\nlook out for you.  By next week Sperry and I will have got\ntogether a scenario for the play and when Sperry reads it\nto Fitzalan we'll get an advance of at least five hundred.  So\nyou and I will take a nice room and bath uptown--as a\nstarter--and we'll be happy again--happier than before.\"\n\n\"No, I'm going to support myself,\" said Susan promptly.\n\n\"Trash!\" cried Spenser, smiling tenderly at her.  \"Do you\nsuppose I'd allow you to mix up in stage life?  You've\nforgotten how jealous I am of you.  You don't know what I've\nsuffered since I've been here sick, brooding over what you're\ndoing, to----\"\n\nShe laid her fingers on his lips.  \"What's the use of fretting\nabout anything that has to be?\" said she, smilingly.  \"I'm\ngoing to support myself.  You may as well make up your mind to it.\"\n\n\"Plenty of time to argue that out,\" said he, and his tone\nforecast his verdict on the arguing.  And he changed the\nsubject by saying, \"I see you still cling to your fad of\nlooking fascinating about the feet.  That was one of the\nreasons I never could trust you.  A girl with as charming\nfeet and ankles as you have, and so much pride in getting\nthem up well, simply cannot be trustworthy.\"  He laughed.\n\"No, you were made to be taken care of, my dear.\"\n\nShe did not press the matter.  She had taken her stand; that\nwas enough for the present.  After an hour with him, she went\nhome to get herself something to eat on her gas stove.\nSpenser's confidence in the future did not move her even to\nthe extent of laying out half a dollar on a restaurant dinner.\nWomen have the habit of believing in the optimistic\noutpourings of egotistical men, and often hasten men along the\nroad to ruin by proclaiming this belief and acting upon it.\nBut not intelligent women of experience; that sort of woman,\nby checking optimistic husbands, fathers, sons, lovers, has\neven put off ruin--sometimes until death has had the chance to\nsave the optimist from the inevitable consequence of his\nfolly.  When she finished her chop and vegetable, instead of\nlighting a cigarette and lingering over a cup of black coffee\nshe quickly straightened up and began upon the play Brent had\ngiven her.  She had read it several times the night before,\nand again and again during the day.  But not until now did she\nfeel sufficiently calmed down from her agitations of thought\nand emotion to attack the play understandingly.\n\nThanks to defective education the most enlightened of us go\nthrough life much like a dim-sighted man who has no\nspectacles.  Almost the whole of the wonderful panorama of the\nuniverse is unseen by us, or, if seen, is but partially\nunderstood or absurdly misunderstood.  When it comes to the\nsubtler things, the things of science and art, rarely indeed\nis there anyone who has the necessary training to get more\nthan the crudest, most imperfect pleasure from them.  What\nlittle training we have is so limping that it spoils the charm\nof mystery with which savage ignorance invests the universe\nfrom blade of grass to star, and does not put in place of that\nbroken charm the profounder and loftier joy of understanding.\nTo take for illustration the most widely diffused of all the\nhigher arts and sciences, reading:  How many so-called\n\"educated\" people can read understandingly even a novel, the\nform of literature designed to make the least demand upon the\nmind?  People say they have read, but, when questioned, they\nshow that they have got merely a glimmering of the real\naction, the faintest hint of style and characterization, have\nperhaps noted some stray epigram which they quote with\nevidently faulty grasp of its meaning.\n\nWhen the thing read is a play, almost no one can get from it\na coherent notion of what it is about.  Most of us have\nnothing that can justly be called imagination; our early\ntraining at home and at school killed in the shoot that finest\nplant of the mind's garden.  So there is no ability to fill in\nthe picture which the dramatic author draws in outline.  Susan\nhad not seen \"Cavalleria Rusticana\" either as play or as\nopera.  But when she and Spenser were together in Forty-fourth\nStreet, she had read plays and had dreamed over them; the talk\nhad been almost altogether of plays--of writing plays, of\nconstructing scenes, of productions, of acting, of all the\nmany aspects of the theater.  Spenser read scenes to her, got\nher to help him with criticism, and she was present when he\nwent over his work with Drumley, Riggs, Townsend and the\nothers.  Thus, reading a play was no untried art to her.\n\nShe read \"Cavalleria\" through slowly, taking about an hour to\nit.  She saw now why Brent had given it to her as the primer\nlesson--the simple, elemental story of a peasant girl's ruin\nunder promise of marriage; of her lover's wearying of one who\nhad only crude physical charm; of his being attracted by a\nyoung married woman, gay as well as pretty, offering the\nsecurity in intrigue that an unmarried woman could not offer.\nSuch a play is at once the easiest and the hardest to act--the\neasiest because every audience understands it perfectly and\nsupplies unconsciously almost any defect in the acting; the\nhardest because any actor with the education necessary to\nacting well finds it next to impossible to divest himself or\nherself of the sophistications of education and get back to\nthe elemental animal.\n\n_Santuzza_ or _Lola_?  Susan debated.  _Santuzza_ was the big and\neasy part; _Lola_, the smaller part, was of the kind that is\nusually neglected.  But Susan saw possibilities in the\ncharacter of the woman who won _Turiddu_ away--the triumphant\nwoman.  The two women represented the two kinds of love--the\nlove that is serious, the love that is light.  And experience\nhad taught her why it is that human nature soon tires of\nintensity, turns to frivolity.  She felt that, if she could\nact, she would try to show that not _Turiddu's_ fickleness nor\nhis contempt of the woman who had yielded, but _Santuzza's_ sad\nintensity and _Lola's_ butterfly gayety had cost _Santuzza_ her\nlover and her lover his life.  So, it was not _Santuzza's_ but\n_Lola's_ first entrance that she studied.\n\nIn the next morning's mail, under cover addressed \"Miss Susan\nLenox, care of Miss Lorna Sackville,\" as she had written it\nfor Brent, came the promised check for forty dollars.  It was\nsigned John P. Garvey, Secretary, and was inclosed with a\nnote bearing the same signature:\n\n\nDEAR MADAM:\n\nHerewith I send you a check for forty dollars for the first\nweek's salary under your arrangement with Mr. Brent.  No\nreceipt is necessary.  Until further notice a check for the\nsame amount will be mailed you each Thursday.  Unless you\nreceive notice to the contrary, please call as before, at\nthree o'clock next Wednesday.\n\n\nIt made her nervous to think of those five days before she\nshould see Brent.  He had assured her he would expect nothing\nfrom her; but she felt she must be able to show him that she\nhad not been wasting her time--his time, the time for which he\nwas paying nearly six dollars a day.  She must work every\nwaking hour, except the two hours each day at the hospital.\nShe recalled what Brent had said about the advantage of being\ncontented alone--and how everything worth doing must be done\nin solitude.  She had never thought about her own feelings as\nto company and solitude, as it was not her habit to think\nabout herself.  But now she realized how solitary she had\nbeen, and how it had bred in her habits of thinking and\nreading--and how valuable these habits would be to her in her\nwork.  There was Rod, for example.  He hated being alone,\nmust have someone around even when he was writing; and he had\nno taste for order or system.  She understood why it was so\nhard for him to stick at anything, to put anything through to\nthe finish.  With her fondness for being alone, with her\npassion for reading and thinking about what she read, surely\nshe ought soon to begin to accomplish something--if there was\nany ability in her.\n\nShe found Rod in higher spirits.  Several ideas for his play\nhad come to him; he already saw it acted, successful, drawing\ncrowded houses, bringing him in anywhere from five hundred to\na thousand a week.  She was not troubled hunting for things to\ntalk about with him--she, who could think of but one thing and\nthat a secret from him.  He talked his play, a steady stream\nwith not a seeing glance at her or a question about her.  She\nwatched the little clock at the side of the bed.  At the end\nof an hour to the minute, she interrupted him in the middle of\na sentence.  \"I must go now,\" said she, rising.\n\n\"Sit down,\" he cried.  \"You can stay all day.  The doctor says\nit will do me good to have you to talk with.  And Sperry isn't\ncoming until tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I can't do it,\" said she.  \"I must go.\"\n\nHe misunderstood her avoiding glance.  \"Now, Susie--sit down\nthere,\" commanded he.  \"We've got plenty of money.  You--you\nneedn't bother about it any more.\"\n\n\"We're not settled yet,\" said she.  \"Until we are, I'd not dare\ntake the risk.\"  She was subtly adroit by chance, not by design.\n\n\"Risk!\" exclaimed he angrily.  \"There's no risk.  I've as good\nas got the advance money.  Sit down.\"\n\nShe hesitated.  \"Don't be angry,\" pleaded she in a voice that\nfaltered.  \"But I must go.\"\n\nInto his eyes came the gleam of distrust and jealousy.  \"Look\nat me,\" he ordered.\n\nWith some difficulty she forced her eyes to meet his.\n\n\"Have you got a lover?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then where do you get the money we're living on?\"  He counted\non her being too humiliated to answer in words.  Instead of\nthe hanging head and burning cheeks he saw clear, steady eyes,\nheard a calm, gentle and dignified voice say:\n\n\"In the streets.\"\n\nHis eyes dropped and a look of abject shame made his face\npitiable.  \"Good Heavens,\" he muttered.\n\n\"How low we are!\"\n\n\"We've been doing the best we could,\" said she simply.\n\n\"Isn't there any decency anywhere in you?\" he flashed out,\neagerly seizing the chance to forget his own shame in\ncontemplating her greater degradation.\n\nShe looked out of the window.  There was something terrible in\nthe calmness of her profile.  She finally said in an even,\npensive voice:\n\n\"You have been intimate with a great many women, Rod.  But you\nhave never got acquainted with a single one.\"\n\nHe laughed good-humoredly.  \"Oh, yes, I have.  I've learned\nthat 'every woman is at heart a rake,' as Mr. Jingle Pope says.\"\n\nShe looked at him again, her face now curiously lighted by her\nslow faint smile.  \"Perhaps they showed you only what they\nthought you'd be able to appreciate,\" she suggested.\n\nHe took this as evidence of her being jealous of him.  \"Tell\nme, Susan, did you leave me--in Forty-fourth Street--because\nyou thought or heard I wasn't true to you?\"\n\n\"What did Drumley tell you?\"\n\n\"I asked him, as you said in your note.  He told me he knew no\nreason.\"\n\nSo Drumley had decided it was best Rod should not know why she\nleft.  Well, perhaps--probably--Drumley was right.  But there\nwas no reason why he shouldn't know the truth now.  \"I left,\"\nsaid she, \"because I saw we were bad for each other.\"\n\nThis amused him.  She saw that he did not believe.  It wounded\nher, but she smiled carelessly.  Her smile encouraged him to\nsay:  \"I couldn't quite make up my mind whether the reason was\njealousy or because you had the soul of a shameless woman.\nYou see, I know human nature, and I know that a woman who once\ncrosses the line never crosses back.  I'll always have to\nwatch you, my dear.  But somehow I like it.  I guess you\nhave--you and I have--a rotten streak in us.  We were brought\nup too strictly.  That always makes one either too firm or too\nloose.  I used to think I liked good women.  But I don't.\nThey bore me.  That shows I'm rotten.\"\n\n\"Or that your idea of what's good is--is mistaken.\"\n\n\"You don't pretend that _you_ haven't done wrong?\" cried Rod.\n\n\"I might have done worse,\" replied she.  \"I might have wronged\nothers.  No, Rod, I can't honestly say I've ever felt wicked.\"\n\n\"Why, what brought you here?\"\n\nShe reflected a moment, then smiled.  \"Two things brought me\ndown,\" said she.  \"In the first place, I wasn't raised right.\nI was raised as a lady instead of as a human being.  So I\ndidn't know how to meet the conditions of life.  In the second\nplace--\" her smile returned, broadened--\"I was too--too what's\ncalled 'good.'\"\n\n\"Pity about you!\" mocked he.\n\n\"Being what's called good is all very well if you're\nindependent or if you've got a husband or a father to do\nlife's dirty work for you--or, perhaps, if you happen to be in\nsome profession like preaching or teaching--though I don't\nbelieve the so-called 'goodness' would let you get very far\neven as a preacher.  In most lines, to practice what we're\ntaught as children would be to go to the bottom like a stone.\nYou know this is a hard world, Rod.  It's full of men and\nwomen fighting desperately for food and clothes and a roof to\ncover them--fighting each other.  And to get on you've got to\nhave the courage and the indifference to your fellow beings\nthat'll enable you to do it.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of truth in that,\" admitted Spenser.  \"If I'd\nnot been such a 'good fellow,' as they call it--a fellow\neverybody liked--if I'd been like Brent, for instance--Brent,\nwho never would have any friends, who never would do anything\nfor anybody but himself, who hadn't a thought except for his\ncareer--why, I'd be where he is.\"\n\nIt was at the tip of Susan's tongue to say, \"Yes--strong--able\nto help others--able to do things worth while.\"  But she did\nnot speak.\n\nRod went on:  \"I'm not going to be a fool any longer.  I'm\ngoing to be too busy to have friends or to help people or to\ndo anything but push my own interests.\"\n\nSusan, indifferent to being thus wholly misunderstood, was\nagain moving toward the door.  \"I'll be back this evening, as\nusual,\" said she.\n\nSpenser's face became hard and lowering:  \"You're going to\nstay here now, or you're not coming back,\" said he.  \"You can\ntake your choice.  Do you want me to know you've got the soul\nof a streetwalker?\"\n\nShe stood at the foot of the bed, gazing at the wall above his\nhead.  \"I must earn our expenses until we're safe,\" said she,\nonce more telling a literal truth that was yet a complete\ndeception.\n\n\"Why do you fret me?\" exclaimed he.  \"Do you want me to be\nsick again?\"\n\n\"Suppose you didn't get the advance right away,\" urged she.\n\n\"I tell you I shall get it!  And I won't have you--do as you\nare doing.  If you go, you go for keeps.\"\n\nShe seated herself.  \"Do you want me to read or take dictation?\"\n\nHis face expressed the satisfaction small people find in small\nsuccesses at asserting authority.  \"Don't be angry,\" said he.\n\"I'm acting for your good.  I'm saving you from yourself.\"\n\n\"I'm not angry,\" replied she, her strange eyes resting upon him.\n\nHe shifted uncomfortably.  \"Now what does that look mean?\" he\ndemanded with an uneasy laugh.\n\nShe smiled, shrugged her shoulders.\n\nSperry--small and thin, a weather-beaten, wooden face\nsuggesting Mr. Punch, sly keen eyes, theater in every tone and\ngesture Sperry pushed the scenario hastily to completion and\nwas so successful with Fitzalan that on Sunday afternoon he\nbrought two hundred and fifty dollars, Spenser's half of the\nadvance money.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you!\" said Spenser to Susan, in triumph.\n\"We'll move at once.  Go pack your traps and put them in a\ncarriage, and by the time you're back here Sperry and the\nnurses will have me ready.\"\n\nIt was about three when Susan got to her room.  Clara heard\nher come in and soon appeared, bare feet in mules, hair\nhanging every which way.  Despite the softening effect of the\nwhite nightdress and of the framing of abundant hair, her face\nwas hard and coarse.  She had been drunk on liquor and on\nopium the night before, and the effects were wearing off.  As\nshe was only twenty years old, the hard coarse look would\nwithdraw before youth in a few hours; it was there only\ntemporarily as a foreshadowing of what Clara would look like\nin five years or so.\n\n\"Hello, Lorna,\" said she.  \"Gee, what a bun my fellow and I\nhad on last night!  Did you hear us scrapping when we came in\nabout five o'clock?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Susan.  \"I was up late and had a lot to do, and\nwas kept at the hospital all day.  I guess I must have fallen\nasleep.\"\n\n\"He gave me an awful beating,\" pursued Clara.  \"But I got one\ngood crack at him with a bottle.\"  She laughed.  \"I don't\nthink he'll be doing much flirting till his cheek heals up.\nHe looks a sight!\"  She opened her nightdress and showed Susan\na deep blue-black mark on her left breast.  \"I wonder if I'll\nget cancer from that?\" said she.  \"It'd be just my rotten\nluck.  I've heard of several cases of it lately, and my father\nkicked my mother there, and she got cancer.  Lord, how she did\nsuffer!\"\n\nSusan shivered, turned her eyes away.  Her blood surged with\njoy that she had once more climbed up out of this deep, dark\nwallow where the masses of her fellow beings weltered in\ndarkness and drunkenness and disease--was up among the favored\nones who, while they could not entirely escape the great ills\nof life, at least had the intelligence and the means to\nmitigate them.  How fortunate that few of these unhappy ones\nhad the imagination to realize their own wretchedness!  \"I\ndon't care what becomes of me,\" Clara was saying.  \"What is\nthere in it for me?  I can have a good time only as long as my\nlooks last--and that's true of every woman, ain't it?  What's\na woman but a body?  Ain't I right?\"\n\n\"That's why I'm going to stop being a woman as soon as ever I\ncan,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Why, you're packing up!\" cried Clara.\n\n\"Yes.  My friend's well enough to be moved.  We're going to\nlive uptown.\"\n\n\"Right away?\"\n\n\"This afternoon.\"\n\nClara dropped into a chair and began to weep.  \"I'll miss you\nsomething fierce!\" sobbed she.  \"You're the only friend in the\nworld I give a damn for, or that gives a damn for me.  I wish\nto God I was like you.  You don't need anybody.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I do, dear,\" cried Susan.\n\n\"But, I mean, you don't lean on anybody.  I don't mean you're\nhard-hearted--for you ain't.  You've pulled me and a dozen\nother girls out of the hole lots of times.  But you're\nindependent.  Can't you take me along?  I can drop that bum\nacross the hall.  I don't give a hoot for him.  But a girl's\ngot to make believe she cares for somebody or she'd blow her\nbrains out.\"\n\n\"I can't take you along, but I'm going to come for you as soon\nas I'm on my feet,\" said Susan.  \"I've got to get up myself\nfirst.  I've learned at least that much.\"\n\n\"Oh, you'll forget all about _me_.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Susan.\n\nAnd Clara knew that she would not.  Moaned Clara, \"I'm not fit\nto go.  I'm only a common streetwalker.  You belong up there.\nYou're going back to your own.  But I belong here.  I wish to\nGod I was like most of the people down here, and didn't have\nany sense.  No wonder you used to drink so!  I'm getting that\nway, too.  The only people that don't hit the booze hard down\nhere are the muttonheads who don't know nothing and can't\nlearn nothing. . . .  I used to be contented.  But somehow,\nbeing with you so much has made me dissatisfied.\"\n\n\"That means you're on your way up,\" said Susan, busy with her packing.\n\n\"It would, if I had sense enough.  Oh, it's torment to have\nsense enough to see, and not sense enough to do!\"\n\n\"I'll come for you soon,\" said Susan.  \"You're going up with me.\"\n\nClara watched her for some time in silence.  \"You're sure\nyou're going to win?\" said she, at last.\n\n\"Sure,\" replied Susan.\n\n\"Oh, you can't be as sure as that.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I can,\" laughed she.  \"I'm done with foolishness.\nI've made up my mind to get up in the world--_with_ my\nself-respect if possible; if not, then without it.  I'm going\nto have everything--money, comfort, luxury, pleasure.\nEverything!\"  And she dropped a folded skirt emphatically upon\nthe pile she had been making, and gave a short, sharp nod.  \"I\nwas taught a lot of things when I was little--things about\nbeing sweet and unselfish and all that.  They'd be fine, if\nthe world was Heaven.  But it isn't.\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" said Clara.\n\n\"Maybe they're fine, if you want to get to Heaven,\" continued\nSusan.  \"But I'm not trying to get to Heaven.  I'm trying to\nlive on earth.  I don't like the game, and I don't like its\nrules.  But--it's the only game, and I can't change the rules.\nSo I'm going to follow them--at least, until I get what I want.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say you've got any respect for yourself?\" said\nClara.  \"_I_ haven't.  And I don't see how any girl in our\nline can have.\"\n\n\"I thought I hadn't,\" was Susan's reply, \"until I talked\nwith--with someone I met the other day.  If you slipped and\nfell in the mud--or were thrown into it--you wouldn't say,\n'I'm dirty through and through.  I can never get clean\nagain'--would you?\"\n\n\"But that's different,\" objected Clara.\n\n\"Not a bit,\" declared Susan.  \"If you look around this world,\nyou'll see that everybody who ever moved about at all has\nslipped and fallen in the mud--or has been pushed in.\"\n\n\"Mostly pushed in.\"\n\n\"Mostly pushed in,\" assented Susan.  \"And those that have good\nsense get up as soon as they can, and wash as much of the mud\noff as'll come off--maybe all--and go on.  The fools--they\nworry about the mud.  But not I--not any more!. . .  And not\nyou, my dear--when I get you uptown.\"\n\nClara was now looking on Susan's departure as a dawn of good\nluck for herself.  She took a headache powder, telephoned for\na carriage, and helped carry down the two big packages that\ncontained all Susan's possessions worth moving.  And they\nkissed each other good-by with smiling faces.  Susan did not\ngive Clara, the loose-tongued, her new address; nor did Clara,\nconscious of her own weakness, ask for it.\n\n\"Don't put yourself out about me,\" cried Clara in farewell.\n\"Get a good tight grip yourself, first.\"\n\n\"That's advice I need,\" answered Susan.  \"Good-by.\nSoon--_soon!_\"\n\nThe carriage had to move slowly through those narrow tenement\nstreets, so thronged were they with the people swarmed from\nhot little rooms into the open to try to get a little air that\ndid not threaten to burn and choke as it entered the lungs.\nSusan's nostrils were filled with the stenches of animal and\nvegetable decay--stenches descending in heavy clouds from the\nopen windows of the flats and from the fire escapes crowded\nwith all manner of rubbish; stenches from the rotting, brimful\ngarbage cans; stenches from the groceries and butcher shops\nand bakeries where the poorest qualities of food were exposed\nto the contamination of swarms of disgusting fat flies, of\nmangy, vermin-harassed children and cats and dogs; stenches\nfrom the never washed human bodies, clad in filthy garments\nand drawn out of shape by disease and toil.  Sore eyes,\nscrofula, withered arm or leg, sagged shoulder, hip out of\njoint--There, crawling along the sidewalk, was the boy whose\nlegs had been cut off by the street car; and the stumps were\nhorribly ulcered.  And there at the basement window drooled\nand cackled the fat idiot girl whose mother sacrificed\neverything always to dress her freshly in pink.  What a\nworld!--where a few people such a very few!--lived in health\nand comfort and cleanliness--and the millions lived in disease\nand squalor, ignorant, untouched of civilization save to wear\nits cast-off clothes and to eat its castaway food and to live\nin its dark noisome cellars!--And to toil unceasingly to make\nfor others the good things of which they had none themselves!\nIt made her heartsick--the sadder because nothing could be\ndone about it.  Stay and help?  As well stay to put out a\nconflagration barehanded and alone.\n\nAs the carriage reached wider Second Avenue, the horses broke\ninto a trot.  Susan drew a long breath of the purer air--then\nshuddered as she saw the corner where the dive into which the\ncadet had lured her flaunted its telltale awnings.  Lower\nstill her spirits sank when she was passing, a few blocks\nfurther on, the music hall.  There, too, she had had a chance,\nhad let hope blaze high.  And she was going forward--into--the\nregion where she had been a slave to Freddie Palmer--no, to\nthe system of which he was a slave no less than she----\n\n\"I _must_ be strong!  I _must!_\"  Susan said to herself, and\nthere was desperation in the gleam of her eyes, in the set of\nher chin.  \"This time I will fight!  And I feel at last that\nI can.\"\n\nBut her spirits soared no more that day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nSPERRY had chosen for \"Mr. and Mrs. Spenser\" the second floor\nrear of a house on the south side of West Forty-fifth Street\na few doors off Sixth Avenue.  It was furnished as a\nsitting-room--elegant in red plush, with oil paintings on the\nwalls, a fringed red silk-plush dado fastened to the\nmantelpiece with bright brass-headed tacks, elaborate\nimitation lace throws on the sofa and chairs, and an imposing\npiece that might have been a cabinet organ or a pianola or a\nroll-top desk but was in fact a comfortable folding bed.\nThere was a marble stationary washstand behind the\nhand-embroidered screen in the corner, near one of the two\nwindows.  Through a deep clothes closet was a small but\nsatisfactory bathroom.\n\n\"And it's warm in winter,\" said Mrs. Norris, the landlady, to\nSusan.  \"Don't you hate a cold bathroom?\"\n\nSusan declared that she did.\n\n\"There's only one thing I hate worse,\" said Mrs. Norris, \"and\nthat's cold coffee.\"\n\nShe had one of those large faces which look bald because the\nframe of hair does not begin until unusually far back.  At\nfifty, when her hair would be thin, Mrs. Norris would be\nhomely; but at thirty she was handsome in a bold, strong\nway.  Her hair was always carefully done, her good figure\nbeautifully corseted.  It was said she was not married to Mr.\nNorris--because New York likes to believe that people are\nliving together without being married, because Mr. Norris came\nand went irregularly, and because Mrs. Norris was so\nparticular about her toilet--and everyone knows that when a\nwoman has the man with whom she's satisfied securely fastened,\nshe shows her content or her virtuous indifference to other\nmen--or her laziness--by neglecting her hair and her hips and\ndressing in any old thing any which way.  Whatever the truth\nas to Mrs. Norris's domestic life, she carried herself\nstrictly and insisted upon keeping her house as respectable as\ncan reasonably be expected in a large city.  That is, everyone\nin it was quiet, was of steady and sedate habit, was backed by\nreferences.  Not until Sperry had thoroughly qualified as a\nresponsible person did Mrs. Norris accept his assurances as to\nthe Spensers and consent to receive them.  Downtown the\napartment houses that admit persons of loose character are\nusually more expensive because that class of tenants have more\nand expect more than ordinary working people.  Uptown the\ncustom is the reverse; to get into a respectable house you\nmust pay more.  The Spensers had to pay fourteen a week for\ntheir quarters--and they were getting a real bargain, Mrs.\nNorris having a weakness for literature and art where they\nwere respectable and paid regularly.\n\n\"What's left of the two hundred and fifty will not last long,\"\nsaid Spenser to Susan, when they were established and alone.\n\"But we'll have another five hundred as soon as the play's\ndone, and that'll be in less than a month.  We're to begin\ntomorrow.  In less than two months the play'll be on and the\nroyalties will be coming in.  I wonder how much I owe the\ndoctor and the hospital.\"\n\n\"That's settled,\" said Susan.\n\nHe glanced at her with a frown.  \"How much was it?  You had no\nright to pay!\"\n\n\"You couldn't have got either doctor or room without payment\nin advance.\"  She spoke tranquilly, with a quiet assurance of\nmanner that was new in her, the nervous and sensitive about\ncausing displeasure in others.  She added, \"Don't be cross,\nRod.  You know it's only pretense.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe anybody has any decency?\" demanded he.\n\n\"It depends on what you mean by decency,\" replied she.  \"But\nwhy talk of the past?  Let's forget it.\"\n\n\"I would that I could!\" exclaimed he.\n\nShe laughed at his heroics.  \"Put that in your play,\" said\nshe.  \"But this isn't the melodrama of the stage.  It's the\nfarce comedy of life.\"\n\n\"How you have changed!  Has all the sweetness, all the\nwomanliness, gone out of your character?\"\n\nShe showed how little she was impressed.  \"I've learned to\ntake terrible things--really terrible things--without making\na fuss--or feeling like making a fuss.  You can't expect me to\nget excited over mere staginess.  They're fond of fake\nemotions up in this part of town.  But down where I've been so\nlong the real horrors come too thick and fast for there to be\nany time to fake.\"\n\nHe continued to frown, presently came out of a deep study to\nsay, \"Susie, I see I've got to have a serious talk with you.\"\n\n\"Wait till you're well, my dear,\" said she.  \"I'm afraid I'll\nnot be very sympathetic with your seriousness.\"\n\n\"No--today.  I'm not an invalid.  And our relations worry me,\nwhenever I think of them.\"\n\nHe observed her as she sat with hands loosely clasped in her\nlap; there was an inscrutable look upon her delicate face,\nupon the clear-cut features so attractively framed by her\nthick dark hair, brown in some lights, black in others.\n\n\"Well?\" said she.\n\n\"To begin, I want you to stop rouging your lips.  It's the\nonly sign of--of what you were.  I'd a little rather you\ndidn't smoke.  But as respectable women smoke nowadays, why I\ndon't seriously object.  And when you get more clothes, get\nquieter ones.  Not that you dress loudly or in bad taste----\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" murmured Susan.\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to interrupt.  Go on.\"\n\n\"I admire the way you dress, but it makes me jealous.  I want\nyou to have nice clothes for the house.  I like things that\nshow your neck and suggest your form.  But I don't want you\nattracting men's eyes and their loose thoughts, in the\nstreet. . . .  And I don't want you to look so damnably alluring\nabout the feet.  That's your best trick--and your worst.  Why\nare you smiling--in that fashion?\"\n\n\"You talk to me as if I were your wife.\"\n\nHe gazed at her with an expression that was as affectionate as\nit was generous--and it was most generous.  \"Well, you may be\nsome day--if you keep straight.  And I think you will.\"\n\nThe artificial red of her lips greatly helped to make her\nsweetly smiling face the perfection of gentle irony.  \"And\nyou?\" said she.\n\n\"You know perfectly well it's different about a man.\"\n\n\"I know nothing of the sort,\" replied she.  \"Among certain\nkinds of people that is the rule.  But I'm not of those kinds.\nI'm trying to make my way in the world, exactly like a man.\nSo I've got to be free from the rules that may be all very\nwell for ladies.  A woman can't fight with her hands tied, any\nmore than a man can--and you know what happens to the men who\nallow themselves to be tied; they're poor downtrodden\ncreatures working hard at small pay for the men who fight with\ntheir hands free.\"\n\n\"I've taken you out of the unprotected woman class, my dear,\"\nhe reminded her.  \"You're mine, now, and you're going back\nwhere you belong.\"\n\n\"Back to the cage it's taken me so long to learn to do\nwithout?\"  She shook her head.  \"No, Rod--I couldn't possibly\ndo it--not if I wanted to. . . .  You've got several false ideas\nabout me.  You'll have to get rid of them, if we're to get along.\"\n\n\"For instance?\"\n\n\"In the first place, don't delude yourself with the notion\nthat I'd marry you.  I don't know whether the man I was forced\nto marry is dead or whether he's got a divorce.  I don't care.\nNo matter how free I was I shouldn't marry you.\"\n\nHe smiled complacently.  She noted it without irritation.\nTruly, small indeed is the heat of any kind that can be got\nfrom the warmed-up ashes of a burnt-out passion.  She went\neasily on:\n\n\"You have nothing to offer me--neither love nor money.  And a\nwoman--unless she's a poor excuse--insists on one or the other.\nYou and I fancied we loved each other for a while.  We don't\nfool ourselves in that way now.  At least I don't, though I\nbelieve you do imagine I'm in love with you.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't be here if you weren't.\"\n\n\"Put that out of your head, Rod.  It'll only breed trouble.\nI don't like to say these things to you, but you compel me to.\nI learned long ago how foolish it is to put off unpleasant\nthings that will have to be faced in the end.  The longer\nthey're put off the worse the final reckoning is.  Most of my\ntroubles have come through my being too weak or\ngood-natured--or whatever it was--to act as my good sense told\nme.  I'm not going to make that mistake any more.  And I'm\ngoing to start the new deal with absolute frankness with you.\nI am not in love with you.\"\n\n\"I know you better than you know yourself,\" said he.\n\n\"For a little while after I found you again I did have a\nreturn of the old feeling--or something like it.  But it soon\npassed.  I couldn't love you.  I know you too well.\"\n\nHe struggled hard with his temper, as his vanity lashed at it.\nShe saw, struggled with her old sensitiveness about inflicting\neven necessary pain upon others, went on:\n\n\"I simply like you, Rod--and that's all.  We're well\nacquainted.  You're physically attractive to me--not wildly\nso, but enough--more than any other man--probably more than\nmost husbands are to their wives--or most wives to their\nhusbands.  So as long as you treat me well and don't wander\noff to other women, I'm more than willing to stay on here.\"\n\n\"Really!\" said he, in an intensely sarcastic tone.  \"Really!\"\n\n\"Now--keep your temper,\" she warned.  \"Didn't I keep mine when\nyou were handing me that impertinent talk about how I should\ndress and the rest of it?  No--let me finish.  In the second\nplace and in conclusion, my dear Rod, I'm not going to live\noff you.  I'll pay my half of the room.  I'll pay for my own\nclothes--and rouge for my lips.  I'll buy and cook what we eat\nin the room; you'll pay when we go to a restaurant.  I believe\nthat's all.\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure?\" inquired he with much satire.\n\n\"Yes, I think so.  Except--if you don't like my terms, I'm\nready to leave at once.\"\n\n\"And go back to the streets, I suppose?\" jeered he.\n\n\"If it were necessary--yes.  So long as I've got my youth and\nmy health, I'll do precisely as I please.  I've no craving for\nrespectability--not the slightest.  I--I----\"  She tried to\nspeak of her birth, that secret shame of which she was\nashamed.  She had been thinking that Brent's big fine way of\nlooking at things had cured her of this bitterness.  She found\nthat it had not--as yet.  So she went on, \"I'd prefer your\nfriendship to your ill will--much prefer it, as you're the\nonly person I can look to for what a man can do for a woman,\nand as I like you.  But if I have to take tyranny along with\nthe friendship--\" she looked at him quietly and her tones were\nalmost tender, almost appealing--\"then, it's good-by, Rod.\"\n\nShe had silenced him, for he saw in her eyes, much more gray\nthan violet though the suggestion of violet was there, that\nshe meant precisely what she said.  He was astonished, almost\ndazed by the change in her.  This woman grown was not the\nSusie who had left him.  No--and yet----\n\nShe had left him, hadn't she?  That showed a character\ncompletely hidden from him, perhaps the character he was now\nseeing.  He asked--and there was no sarcasm and a great deal\nof uneasiness in his tone:\n\n\"How do you expect to make a living?\"\n\n\"I've got a place at forty dollars a week.\"\n\n\"Forty dollars a week!  You!\"  He scowled savagely at her.\n\"There's only one thing anyone would pay you forty a week for.\"\n\n\"That's what I'd have said,\" rejoined she.  \"But it seems not\nto be true.  My luck may not last, but while it lasts, I'll\nhave forty a week.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you,\" said he, with the angry bluntness\nof jealousy.\n\n\"Then you want me to go?\" inquired she, with a certain\nmelancholy but without any weakness.\n\nHe ignored her question.  He demanded:\n\n\"Who's giving it to you?\"\n\n\"Brent.\"\n\nSpenser leaned from the bed toward her in his excitement.\n\"_Robert_ Brent?\" he cried.\n\n\"Yes.  I'm to have a part in one of his plays.\"\n\nSpenser laughed harshly.  \"What rot!  You're his mistress.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't be strange for you to think I'd accept that\nposition for so little, but you must know a man of his sort\nwouldn't have so cheap a mistress.\"\n\n\"It's simply absurd.\"\n\n\"He is to train me himself.\"\n\n\"You never told me you knew him.\"\n\n\"I don't.\"\n\n\"Who got you the job?\"\n\n\"He saw me in Fitzalan's office the day you sent me there.  He\nasked me to call, and when I went he made me the offer.\"\n\n\"Absolute rot.  What reason did he give?\"\n\n\"He said I looked as if I had the temperament he was in search of.\"\n\n\"You must take me for a fool.\"\n\n\"Why should I lie to you?\"\n\n\"God knows.  Why do women lie to men all the time?  For the\npleasure of fooling them.\"\n\n\"Oh, no.  To get money, Rod--the best reason in the world, it\nbeing rather hard for a woman to make money by working for it.\"\n\n\"The man's in love with you!\"\n\n\"I wish he were,\" said Susan, laughing.  \"I'd not be here, my\ndear--you may be sure of that.  And I'd not content myself\nwith forty a week.  Oh, you don't know what tastes I've got!\nWait till I turn myself loose.\"\n\n\"Well--you can--in a few months,\" said Spenser.\n\nEven as he had been protesting his disbelief in her story, his\nmanner toward her had been growing more respectful--a change\nthat at once hurt and amused her with its cynical suggestions,\nand also pleased her, giving her a confidence-breeding sense\nof a new value in herself.  Rod went on, with a kind of\nshamefaced mingling of jest and earnest:\n\n\"You stick by me, Susie, old girl, and the time'll come when\nI'll be able to give you more than Brent.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Susan.\n\nHe eyed her sharply.  \"I feel like a fool believing such a\nfairy story as you've been telling me.  Yet I do.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" laughed she.  \"Now I can stay.  If you hadn't\nbelieved me, I'd have had to go.  And I don't want to do\nthat--not yet.\"\n\nHis eyes flinched.  \"Not yet?  What does that mean?\"\n\n\"It means I'm content to stay, at present.  Who can answer for\ntomorrow?\"  Her eyes lit up mockingly.  \"For instance--you.\nToday you think you're going to be true to me don't you?  Yet\ntomorrow--or as soon as you get strength and street clothes, I\nmay catch you in some restaurant telling some girl she's the\none you've been getting ready for.\"\n\nHe laughed, but not heartily.  Sperry came, and Susan went to\nbuy at a department store a complete outfit for Rod, who still\nhad only nightshirts.  As she had often bought for him in the\nold days, she felt she would have no difficulty in fitting him\nnearly enough, with her accurate eye supplementing the\nmeasurements she had taken.  When she got back home two hours\nand a half later, bringing her purchases in a cab, Sperry had\ngone and Rod was asleep.  She sat in the bathroom, with the\ngas lighted, and worked at \"Cavalleria\" until she heard him\ncalling.  He had awakened in high good-humor.\n\n\"That was an awful raking you gave me before Sperry came,\"\nbegan he.  \"But it did me good.  A man gets so in the habit of\nordering women about that it becomes second nature to him.\nYou've made it clear to me that I've even less control over\nyou than you have over me.  So, dear, I'm going to be humble\nand try to give satisfaction, as servants say.\"\n\n\"You'd better,\" laughed Susan.  \"At least, until you get on\nyour feet again.\"\n\n\"You say we don't love each other,\" Rod went on, a becoming\nbrightness in his strong face.  \"Well--maybe so.  But--we suit\neach other--don't we?\"\n\n\"That's why I want to stay,\" said Susan, sitting on the bed\nand laying her hand caressingly upon his.  \"I could stand it\nto go, for I've been trained to stand anything--everything.\nBut I'd hate it.\"\n\nHe put his arm round her, drew her against his breast.\n\"Aren't you happy here?\" he murmured.\n\n\"Happier than any place else in the world,\" replied she softly.\n\nAfter a while she got a small dinner for their two selves on\nthe gas stove she had brought with her and had set up in the\nbathroom.  As they ate, she cross-legged on the bed opposite\nhim, they beamed contentedly at each other.  \"Do you remember\nthe dinner we had at the St. Nicholas in Cincinnati?\" asked she.\n\n\"It wasn't as good as this,\" declared he.  \"Not nearly so well\ncooked.  You could make a fortune as a cook.  But then you do\neverything well.\"\n\n\"Even to rouging my lips?\"\n\n\"Oh, forget it!\" laughed he.  \"I'm an ass.  There's a\nwonderful fascination in the contrast between the dash of\nscarlet and the pallor of that clear, lovely skin of yours.\"\n\nHer eyes danced.  \"You are getting well!\" she exclaimed.  \"I'm\nsorry I bought you clothes.  I'll be uneasy every time you're out.\"\n\n\"You can trust me.  I see I've got to hustle to keep my job\nwith you.  Well, thank God, your friend Brent's old enough to\nbe your father.\"\n\n\"Is he?\" cried Susan.  \"Do you know, I never thought of his age.\"\n\n\"Yes, he's forty at least--more.  Are you sure he isn't after\n_you_, Susie?\"\n\n\"He warned me that if I annoyed him in that way he'd discharge me.\"\n\n\"Do you like him?\"\n\n\"I--don't--know\" was Susan's slow, reflective answer.\n\"I'm--afraid of him--a little.\"\n\nBoth became silent.  Finally Rod said, with an impatient shake\nof the head, \"Let's not think of him.\"\n\n\"Let's try on your new clothes,\" cried Susan.\n\nAnd when the dishes were cleared away they had a grand time\ntrying on the things she had bought.  It was amazing how near\nshe had come to fitting him.  \"You ought to feel flattered,\"\nsaid she.  \"Only a labor of love could have turned out so well.\"\n\nHe turned abruptly from admiring his new suit in the glass and\ncaught her in his arms.  \"You do love me--you do!\" he cried.\n\"No woman would have done all you've done for me, if she didn't.\"\n\nFor answer, Susan kissed him passionately; and as her body\ntrembled with the sudden upheaval of emotions long dormant or\nindulged only in debased, hateful ways, she burst into tears.\nShe knew, even in that moment of passion, that she did not\nlove him; but not love itself can move the heart more deeply\nthan gratitude and her bruised heart was so grateful for his\nwords and tones and gestures of affection!\n\nWednesday afternoon, on the way to Brent's house, she glanced\nup at the clock in the corner tower of the Grand Central\nStation.  It lacked five minutes of three.  She walked slowly,\ntimed herself so accurately that, as the butler opened the\ndoor, a cathedral chime hidden somewhere in the upper interior\nboomed the hour musically.  The man took her direct to the\nelevator, and when it stopped at the top floor, Brent himself\nopened the door, as before.  He was dismissing a short fat man\nwhom Susan placed as a manager, and a tall, slim, and most\nfashionably dressed woman with a beautiful insincere\nface--anyone would have at once declared her an actress,\nprobably a star.  The woman gave Susan a searching, feminine\nlook which changed swiftly to superciliousness.  Both the man\nand the woman were loath to go, evidently had not finished\nwhat they had come to say.  But Brent, in his abrupt but\ncourteous way, said:\n\n\"Tomorrow at four, then.  As you see, my next appointment has\nbegun.\"  And he had them in the elevator with the door closed.\nHe turned upon Susan the gaze that seemed to take in\neverything.  \"You are in better spirits, I see,\" said he.\n\n\"I'm sorry to have interrupted,\" said she.  \"I could have waited.\"\n\n\"But _I_ couldn't,\" replied he.  \"Some day you'll discover\nthat your time is valuable, and that to waste it is far\nsillier than if you were to walk along throwing your money\ninto the gutter.  Time ought to be used like money--spent\ngenerously but intelligently.\"  He talked rapidly on, with his\nmanner as full of unexpressed and inexpressible intensity as\nthe voice of the violin, with his frank egotism that had no\nsuggestion of vanity or conceit.  \"Because I systematize my\ntime, I'm never in a hurry, never at a loss for time to give\nto whatever I wish.  I didn't refuse to keep you waiting for\nyour sake but for my own.  Now the next hour belongs to you\nand me--and we'll forget about time--as, if we were dining in\na restaurant, we'd not think of the bill till it was\npresented.  What did you do with the play?\"\n\nSusan could only look at him helplessly.\n\nHe laughed, handed her a cigarette, rose to light a match for\nher.  \"Settle yourself comfortably,\" said he, \"and say what's\nin your head.\"\n\nWith hands deep in the trousers of his house suit, he paced up\nand down the long room, the cigarette loose between his lips.\nWhenever she saw his front face she was reassured; but\nwhenever she saw his profile, her nerves trembled--for in the\nprofile there was an expression of almost ferocious\nresolution, of tragic sadness, of the sternness that spares\nnot.  The full face was kind, if keen; was sympathetic--was\nthe man as nature had made him.  The profile was the great\nman--the man his career had made.  And Susan knew that the\nprofile was master.\n\n\"Which part did you like _Santuzza_ or _Lola_?\"\n\n\"_Lola_,\" replied she.\n\nHe paused, looked at her quickly.  Why?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't sympathize with the woman--or the man--who's\ndeserted.  I pity, but I can't help seeing it's her or his own\nfault.  _Lola_ explains why.  Wouldn't you rather laugh than\ncry?  _Santuzza_ may have been attractive in the moments of\npassion, but how she must have bored _Turiddu_ the rest of the\ntime!  She was so intense, so serious--so vain and selfish.\"\n\n\"Vain and selfish?  That's interesting.\"  He walked up and\ndown several times, then turned on her abruptly.  \"Well--go on,\"\nhe said.  \"I'm waiting to hear why she was vain and selfish.\"\n\n\"Isn't it vain for a woman to think a man ought to be crazy\nabout her all the time because he once has been?  Isn't it\nselfish for her to want him to be true to her because it gives\n_her_ pleasure, even though she knows it doesn't give _him_ pleasure?\"\n\n\"Men and women are all vain and selfish in love,\" said he.\n\n\"But the women are meaner than the men,\" replied she, \"because\nthey're more ignorant and narrow-minded.\"\n\nHe was regarding her with an expression that made her uneasy.\n\"But that isn't in the play--none of it,\" said he.\n\n\"Well, it ought to be,\" replied she.  \"_Santuzza_ is the\nold-fashioned conventional heroine.  I used to like\nthem--until I had lived a little, myself.  She isn't true to\nlife.  But in _Lola_----\"\n\n\"Yes--what about _Lola_?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Oh, she wasn't a heroine, either.  She was just human--taking\nhappiness when it offered.  And her gayety--and her\ncapriciousness.  A man will always break away from a solemn,\nintense woman to get that sort of sunshine.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes--go on,\" said Brent.\n\n\"And her sour, serious, solemn husband explains why wives are\nuntrue to their husbands.  At least, it seems so to me.\"\n\nHe was walking up and down again.  Every trace of indolence,\nof relaxation, was gone from his gait and from his features.\nHis mind was evidently working like an engine at full speed.\nSuddenly he halted.  \"You've given me a big idea,\" said he.\n\"I'll throw away the play I was working on.  I'll do your play.\"\n\nSusan laughed--pleased, yet a little afraid he was kinder than\nshe deserved.  \"What I said was only common sense--what my\nexperience has taught me.\"\n\n\"That's all that genius is, my dear,\" replied he.  \"As soon as\nwe're born, our eyes are operated on so that we shall never\nsee anything as it is.  The geniuses are those who either\nescape the operation or are reëndowed with true sight by\nexperience.\"  He nodded approvingly at her.  \"You're going to\nbe a person--or, rather, you're going to show you're a person.\nBut that comes later.  You thought of _Lola_ as your part?\"\n\n\"I tried to.  But I don't know anything about acting except\nwhat I've seen and the talk I've heard.\"\n\n\"As I said the other day, that means you've little to learn.\nNow--as to _Lola's_ entrance.\"\n\n\"Oh, I thought of a lot of things to do--to show that she, too,\nloved _Turiddu_ and that she had as much right to love--and to\nbe loved--as _Santuzza_ had.  _Santuzza_ had had her chance, and\nhad failed.\"\n\nBrent was highly amused.  \"You seem to forget that _Lola_ was a\nmarried woman--and that if _Santuzza_ didn't get a husband she'd\nbe the mother of a fatherless child.\"\n\nNever had he seen in her face such a charm of sweet melancholy\nas at that moment.  \"I suppose the way I was born and the life\nI've led make me think less of those things than most people\ndo,\" replied she.  \"I was talking about natural hearts--what\npeople think inside--the way they act when they have courage.\"\n\n\"When they have courage,\" Brent repeated reflectively.  \"But\nwho has courage?\"\n\n\"A great many people are compelled to have it,\" said she.\n\n\"I never had it until I got enough money to be independent.\"\n\n\"I never had it,\" said Susan, \"until I had no money.\"\n\nHe leaned against the big table, folded his arms on his chest,\nlooked at her with eyes that made her feel absolutely at ease\nwith him.  Said he:\n\n\"You have known what it was to have no money--none?\"\n\nSusan nodded.  \"And no friends--no place to sleep--worse off\nthan _Robinson Crusoe_ when the waves threw him on the island.\nI had to--to suck my own blood to keep alive.\"\n\n\"You smile as you say that,\" said he.\n\n\"If I hadn't learned to smile over such things,\" she answered,\n\"I'd have been dead long ago.\"\n\nHe seated himself opposite her.  He asked:\n\n\"Why didn't you kill yourself?\"\n\n\"I was afraid.\"\n\n\"Of the hereafter?\"\n\n\"Oh no.  Of missing the coming true of my dreams about life.\"\n\n\"Love?\"\n\n\"That--and more.  Just love wouldn't satisfy me.  I want to\nsee the world--to know the world--and to be somebody.  I want\nto try _everything_.\"\n\nShe laughed gayly--a sudden fascinating vanishing of the\nmelancholy of eyes and mouth, a sudden flashing out of young\nbeauty.  \"I've been down about as deep as one can go.  I want\nto explore in the other direction.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes,\" said Brent, absently.  \"You must see it all.\"\n\nHe remained for some time in a profound reverie, she as\nunconscious of the passing of time as he for if he had his\nthoughts, she had his face to study.  Try as she would, she\ncould not associate the idea of age with him--any age.  He\nseemed simply a grown man.  And the more closely she studied\nhim the greater her awe became.  He knew so much; he\nunderstood so well.  She could not imagine him swept away by\nany of the petty emotions--the vanities, the jealousies, the\nsmall rages, the small passions and loves that made up the\npetty days of the small creatures who inhabit the world and\ncall it theirs.  Could he fall in love?  Had he been in love?\nYes--he must have been in love many times--for many women must\nhave taken trouble to please a man so well worth while, and he\nmust have passed from one woman to another as his whims or his\ntastes changed.  Could he ever care about her--as a woman?\nDid he think her worn out as a physical woman?  Or would he\nrealize that body is nothing by itself; that unless the soul\nenters it, it is cold and meaningless and worthless--like the\nelectric bulb when the filament is dark and the beautiful,\nhot, brilliant and intensely living current is not in it?\nCould she love him?  Could she ever feel equal and at ease,\nthrough and through, with a man so superior?\n\n\"You'd better study the part of _Lola_--learn the lines,\" said\nhe, when he had finished his reflecting.  \"Then--this day week\nat the same hour--we will begin.  We will work all\nafternoon--we will dine together--go to some theater where I\ncan illustrate what I mean.  Beginning with next Wednesday\nthat will be the program every day until further notice.\"\n\n\"Until you see whether you can do anything with me or not?\"\n\n\"Just so.  You are living with Spenser?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"  Susan could have wished his tone less matter-of-fact.\n\n\"How is he getting on?\"\n\n\"He and Sperry are doing a play for Fitzalan.\"\n\n\"Really?  That's good.  He has talent.  If he'll learn of\nSperry and talk less and work more, and steadily, he'll make\na lot of money.  You are not tied to him in any way?\"\n\n\"No--not now that he's prospering.  Except, of course, that\nI'm fond of him.\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.  \"Oh, everybody must have somebody.\nYou've not seen this house.  I'll show it to you, as we've\nstill fifteen minutes.\"\n\nA luxurious house it was--filled with things curious and, some\nof them, beautiful--things gathered in excursions through\nEurope, Susan assumed.  The only absolutely simple room was\nhis bedroom, big and bare and so arranged that he could sleep\npractically out of doors.  She saw servants--two men besides\nthe butler, several women.  But the house was a bachelor's\nhouse, with not a trace of feminine influence.  And evidently\nhe cared nothing about it but lived entirely in that wonderful\nworld which so awed Susan--the world he had created within\nhimself, the world of which she had alluring glimpses through\nhis eyes, through his tones and gestures even.  Small people\nstrive to make, and do make, impression of themselves by\nlaboring to show what they know and think.  But the person of\nthe larger kind makes no such effort.  In everything Brent\nsaid and did and wore, in all his movements, gestures,\nexpressions, there was the unmistakable hallmark of the man\nworth while.  The social life has banished simplicity from\neven the most savage tribe.  Indeed, savages, filled with\nsuperstitions, their every movement the result of some notion\nof proper ceremonial, are the most complex of all the human\nkind.  The effort toward simplicity is not a movement back to\nnature, for there savage and lower animal are completely\nenslaved by custom and instinct; it is a movement upward\ntoward the freedom of thought and action of which our best\nintelligence has given us a conception and for which it has\ngiven us a longing.  Never had Susan met so simple a man; and\nnever had she seen one so far from all the silly ostentations\nof rudeness, of unattractive dress, of eccentric or coarse\nspeech wherewith the cheap sort of man strives to proclaim\nhimself individual and free.\n\nWith her instinct for recognizing the best at first sight,\nSusan at once understood.  And she was like one who has been\nstumbling about searching for the right road, and has it\nsuddenly shown to him.  She fairly darted along this right\nroad.  She was immediately busy, noting the mistakes in her\nown ideas of manners and dress, of good and bad taste.  She\nrealized how much she had to learn.  But this did not\ndiscourage her.  For she realized at the same time that she\ncould learn--and his obvious belief in her as a possibility\nwas most encouraging.\n\nWhen he bade her good-by at the front door and it closed\nbehind her, she was all at once so tired that it seemed to her\nshe would then and there sink down through sheer fatigue and\nfall asleep.  For no physical exercise so quickly and utterly\nexhausts as real brain exercise--thinking, studying, learning\nwith all the concentrated intensity of a thoroughbred in the\nlast quarter of the mile race.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nSPENSER had time and thought for his play only.  He no longer\ntormented himself with jealousy of the abilities and income\nand fame of Brent and the other successful writers for the\nstage; was not he about to equal them, probably to surpass\nthem?  As a rule, none of the mean emotions is able to\nthrive--unless it has the noxious vapors from disappointment\nand failure to feed upon.  Spenser, in spirits and in hope\nagain, was content with himself.  Jealousy of Brent about\nSusan had been born of dissatisfaction with himself as a\nfailure and envy of Brent as a success; it died with that\ndissatisfaction and that envy.  His vanity assured him that\nwhile there might be possibly--ways in which he was not\nwithout rivals, certainly where women were concerned he simply\ncould not be equaled; the woman he wanted he could have--and he\ncould hold her as long as he wished.  The idea that Susan\nwould give a sentimental thought to a man \"old enough to be\nher father\"--Brent was forty-one--was too preposterous to\npresent itself to his mind.  She loved the handsome,\nfascinating, youthful Roderick Spenser; she would soon be\ncrazy about him.\n\nRarely does it occur to a man to wonder what a woman is\nthinking.  During courtship very young men attribute intellect\nand qualities of mystery and awe to the woman they love.  But\nafter men get an insight into the mind of woman and discover\nhow trivial are the matters that of necessity usually engage\nit, they become skeptical about feminine mentality; they would\nas soon think of speculating on what profundities fill the\nbrain of the kitten playing with a ball as of seeking a\nsolution of the mystery behind a woman's fits of abstraction.\nHowever, there was in Susan's face, especially in her eyes, an\nexpression so unusual, so arresting that Spenser,\nself-centered and convinced of woman's intellectual deficiency\nthough he was, did sometimes inquire what she was thinking\nabout.  He asked this question at breakfast the morning after\nthat second visit to Brent.\n\n\"Was I thinking?\" she countered.\n\n\"You certainly were not listening.  You haven't a notion what\nI was talking about.\"\n\n\"About your play.\"\n\n\"Of course.  You know I talk nothing else,\" laughed he.  \"I\nmust bore you horribly.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" protested she.\n\n\"No, I suppose not.  You're not bored because you don't listen.\"\n\nHe was cheerful about it.  He talked merely to arrange his\nthoughts, not because he expected Susan to understand matters\nfar above one whom nature had fashioned and experience had\ntrained to minister satisfyingly to the physical and\nsentimental needs of man.  He assumed that she was as\nworshipful before his intellect as in the old days.  He would\nhave been even more amazed than enraged had he known that she\nregarded his play as mediocre claptrap, false to life, fit\nonly for the unthinking, sloppily sentimental crowd that could\nnot see the truth about even their own lives, their own\nthoughts and actions.\n\n\"There you go again!\" cried he, a few minutes later.  \"What\n_are_ you thinking about?  I forgot to ask how you got on with\nBrent.  Poor chap--he's had several failures in the past year.\nHe must be horribly cut up.  They say he's written out.  What\ndoes he think he's trying to get at with you?\"\n\n\"Acting, as I told you,\" replied Susan.  She felt ashamed for\nhim, making this pitiable exhibition of patronizing a great man.\n\n\"Sperry tells me he has had that twist in his brain for a long\ntime--that he has tried out a dozen girls or more--drops them\nafter a few weeks or months.  He has a regular system about\nit--runs away abroad, stops the pay after a month or so.\"\n\n\"Well, the forty a week's clear gain while it lasts,\" said\nSusan.  She tried to speak lightly.  But she felt hurt and\nuncomfortable.  There had crept into her mind one of those\ndisagreeable ideas that skurry into some dusky corner to hide,\nand reappear from time to time making every fit of the blues\nso much the sadder and aggravating despondency toward despair.\n\n\"Oh, I didn't mean to suggest that _you_ wouldn't succeed,\"\nSpenser hastened to apologize with more or less real\nkindliness.  \"Sperry says Brent has some good ideas about\nacting.  So, you'll learn something--maybe enough to enable me\nto put you in a good position--if Brent gets tired and if you\nstill want to be independent, as you call it.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Susan absently.\n\nSpenser was no more absorbed in his career than she in hers;\nonly, she realized how useless it would be to try to talk it\nto him--that he would not give her so much as ears in an\nattitude of polite attention.  If he could have looked into\nher head that morning and seen what thoughts were distracting\nher from hearing about the great play, he would have been more\namused and disgusted than ever with feminine frivolity of mind\nand incapacity in serious matters.  For, it so happened that\nat the moment Susan was concentrating on a new dress.  He\nwould have laughed in the face of anyone saying to him that\nthis new dress was for Susan in the pursuit of her scheme of\nlife quite as weighty a matter, quite as worthy of the most\ncareful attention, as was his play for him.  Yet that would\nhave been the literal truth.  Primarily man's appeal is to the\near, woman's to the eye--the reason, by the way, why the\ntheater--preeminently the place to _see_--tends to be dominated\nby woman.\n\nSusan had made up her mind not only that she would rapidly\nimprove herself in every way, but also how she would go about\nthe improving.  She saw that, for a woman at least, dress is\nas much the prime essential as an arresting show window for a\ndealer in articles that display well.  She knew she was far\nfrom the goal of which she dreamed--the position where she\nwould no longer be a woman primarily but a personage.  Dress\nwould not merely increase her physical attractiveness; it\nwould achieve the far more important end of gaining her a\nlarge measure of consideration.  She felt that Brent, even\nBrent, dealer in actualities and not to be fooled by\npretenses, would in spite of himself change his opinion of her\nif she went to him dressed less like a middle class working\ngirl, more like the woman of the upper classes.  At best,\nusing all the advantages she had, she felt there was small\nenough chance of her holding his interest; for she could not\nmake herself believe that he was not deceiving himself about\nher.  However, to strengthen herself in every way with him was\nobviously the wisest effort she could make.  So, she must have\na new dress for the next meeting, one which would make him\nbetter pleased to take her out to dinner.  True, if she came\nin rags, he would not be disturbed--for he had nothing of the\nsnob in him.  But at the same time, if she came dressed like\na woman of his own class, he would be impressed.  \"He's a\nman, if he is a genius,\" reasoned she.\n\nVital though the matter was, she calculated that she did not\ndare spend more than twenty-five dollars on this toilet.  She\nmust put by some of her forty a week; Brent might give her up\nat any time, and she must not be in the position of having to\nchoose immediately between submitting to the slavery of the\nkept woman as Spenser's dependent and submitting to the costly\nand dangerous and repulsive freedom of the woman of the\nstreets.  Thus, to lay out twenty-five dollars on a single\ncostume was a wild extravagance.  She thought it over from\nevery point of view; she decided that she must take the risk.\n\nLate in the afternoon she walked for an hour in Fifth Avenue.\nAfter some hesitation she ventured into the waiting- and\ndressing-rooms of several fashionable hotels.  She was in\nsearch of ideas for the dress, which must be in the prevailing\nfashion.  She had far too good sense and good taste to attempt\nto be wholly original in dress; she knew that the woman who\nunderstands her business does not try to create a fashion but\nuses the changing and capricious fashion as the means to\nexpress a constant and consistent style of her own.  She\nappreciated her limitations in such matters--how far she as\nyet was from the knowledge necessary to forming a permanent\nand self-expressive style.  She was prepared to be most\ncautious in giving play to an individual taste so imperfectly\neducated as hers had necessarily been.\n\nShe felt that she had the natural instinct for the best and\ncould recognize it on sight--an instinct without which no one\ncan go a step forward in any of the arts.  She had long since\nlearned to discriminate among the vast masses of offering,\nmost of them tasteless or commonplace, to select the rare and\nfew things that have merit.  Thus, she had always stood out in\nthe tawdrily or drearily or fussily dressed throngs, had been\na pleasure to the eyes even of those who did not know why they\nwere pleased.  On that momentous day, she finally saw a woman\ndressed in admirable taste who was wearing a costume simple\nenough for her to venture to think of copying the main points.\nShe walked several blocks a few yards behind this woman, then\nhurried ahead of her, turned and walked toward her to inspect\nthe front of the dress.  She repeated this several times\nbetween the St. Regis and Sherry's.  The woman soon realized,\nas women always do, what the girl in the shirtwaist and short\nskirt was about.  But she happened to be a good-natured\nperson, and smiled pleasantly at Susan, and got in return a\nsmile she probably did not soon forget.\n\nThe next morning Susan went shopping.  She had it in mind to\nget the materials for a costume of a certain delicate shade of\nviolet.  A dress of that shade, and a big hat trimmed in tulle\nto match or to harmonize, with a bunch of silk violets\nfastened in the tulle in a certain way.\n\nSusan knew she had good looks, knew what was becoming to her\ndarkly and softly fringed violet eyes, pallid skin, to her\nrather tall figure, slender, not voluptuous yet suggesting\nvoluptuousness.  She could see herself in that violet costume.\nBut when she began to look at materials she hesitated.  The\nviolet would be beautiful; but it was not a wise investment\nfor a girl with few clothes, with but one best dress.  She did\nnot give it up definitely, however, until she came upon a\nsixteen-yard remnant of soft gray China crêpe.  Gray was a\nreally serviceable color for the best dress of a girl of small\nmeans.  And this remnant, certainly enough for a dress, could\nbe had for ten dollars, where violet China crêpe of the shade\nshe wanted would cost her a dollar a yard.  She took the remnant.\n\nShe went to the millinery department and bought a large hat\nframe.  It was of a good shape and she saw how it could be\nbent to suit her face.  She paid fifty cents for this, and two\ndollars and seventy cents for four yards of gray tulle.  She\nfound that silk flowers were beyond her means; so she took a\nbunch of presentable looking violets of the cheaper kind at\ntwo dollars and a half.  She happened to pass a counter\nwhereon were displayed bargains in big buckles and similar\nodds and ends of steel and enamel.  She fairly pounced upon a\nhandsome gray buckle with violet enamel, which cost but\neighty-nine cents.  For a pair of gray suede ties she paid two\ndollars; for a pair of gray silk stockings, ninety cents.\nThese matters, with some gray silk net for the collar, gray\nsilk for a belt, linings and the like, made her total bill\ntwenty-three dollars and sixty-seven cents.  She returned home\ncontent and studied \"Cavalleria\" until her purchases arrived.\n\nSpenser was out now, was working all day and in the evenings\nat Sperry's office high up in the Times Building.  So, Susan\nhad freedom for her dressmaking operations.  To get them off\nher mind that she might work uninterruptedly at learning\n_Lola's_ part in \"Cavalleria,\" she toiled all Saturday, far into\nSunday morning, was astir before Spenser waked, finished the\ndress soon after breakfast and the hat by the middle of the\nafternoon.  When Spenser returned from Sperry's office to take\nher to dinner, she was arrayed.  For the first time he saw her\nin fashionable attire and it was really fashionable, for\ndespite all her disadvantages she, who had real and rare\ncapacity for learning, had educated herself well in the chief\nbusiness of woman the man-catcher in her years in New York.\n\nHe stood rooted to the threshold.  It would have justified a\nvanity less vigorous than Susan or any other normal human\nbeing possessed, to excite such a look as was in his eyes.  He\ndrew a long breath by way of breaking the spell over speech.\n\n\"You are _beautiful!_\" he exclaimed.\n\nAnd his eyes traveled from the bewitching hat, set upon her\nhead coquettishly yet without audacity, to the soft crêpe\ndress, its round collar showing her perfect throat, its\ngraceful lines subtly revealing her alluring figure, to the\nfeet that men always admired, whatever else of beauty or charm\nthey might fail to realize.\n\n\"How you have grown!\" he ejaculated.  Then,  \"How did you do it?\"\n\n\"By all but breaking myself.\"\n\n\"It's worth whatever it cost.  If I had a dress suit, we'd go\nto Sherry's or the Waldorf.  I'm willing to go, without the\ndress suit.\"\n\n\"No.  I've got everything ready for dinner at home.\"\n\n\"Then, why on earth did you dress?  To give me a treat?\"\n\n\"Oh, I hate to go out in a dress I've never worn.  And a woman\nhas to wear a hat a good many times before she knows how.\"\n\n\"What a lot of fuss you women do make about clothes.\"\n\"You seem to like it, all the same.\"\n\n\"Of course.  But it's a trifle.\"\n\n\"It has got many women a good provider for life.  And not\npaying attention to dress or not knowing how has made most of\nthe old maids.  Are those things trifles?\"\n\nSpenser laughed and shifted his ground without any sense of\nhaving been pressed to do so.  \"Men are fools where women\nare concerned.\"\n\n\"Or women are wise where men are concerned.\"\n\n\"I guess they do know their business--some of them,\" he\nconfessed.  \"Still, it's a silly business, you must admit.\"\n\n\"Nothing is silly that's successful,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Depends on what you mean by success,\" argued he.\n\n\"Success is getting what you want.\"\n\n\"Provided one wants what's worth while,\" said he.\n\n\"And what's worth while?\" rejoined she.  \"Why, whatever one\nhappens to want.\"\n\nTo avoid any possible mischance to the _grande toilette_\nhe served the dinner and did the dangerous part of the\nclearing up.  They went to the theater, Rod enjoying even more\nthan she the very considerable admiration she got.  When she\nwas putting the dress away carefully that night, Rod inquired\nwhen he was to be treated again.\n\n\"Oh--I don't know,\" replied she.  \"Not soon.\"\n\nShe was too wise to tell him that the dress would not be worn\nagain until Brent was to see it.  The hat she took out of the\ncloset from time to time and experimented with it, reshaping\nthe brim, studying the different effects of different angles.\nIt delighted Spenser to catch her at this \"foolishness\"; he\nfelt so superior, and with his incurable delusion of the\nshallow that dress is an end, not merely a means, he felt more\nconfident than ever of being able to hold her when he should\nhave the money to buy her what her frivolous and feminine\nnature evidently craved beyond all else in the world.  But----\n\nWhen he bought a ready-to-wear evening suit, he made more stir\nabout it than had Susan about her costume--this, when dress to\nhim was altogether an end in itself and not a shrewd and\nuseful means.  He spent more time in admiring himself in it\nbefore the mirror, and looked at it, and at himself in it,\nwith far more admiration and no criticism at all.  Susan noted\nthis--and after the manner of women who are wise or\nindifferent--or both--she made no comment.\n\n\nAt the studio floor of Brent's house the door of the elevator\nwas opened for Susan by a small young man with a notably large\nhead, bald and bulging.  His big smooth face had the\nexpression of extreme amiability that usually goes with\nweakness and timidity.  \"I am Mr. Brent's secretary, Mr.\nGarvey,\" he explained.  And Susan--made as accurate as quick\nin her judgments of character by the opportunities and the\nnecessities of her experience--saw that she had before her one\nof those nice feeble folk who either get the shelter of some\nstrong personality as a bird hides from the storm in the thick\nbranches of a great tree or are tossed and torn and ruined by\nlife and exist miserably until rescued by death.  She knew the\ntype well; it had been the dominant type in her surroundings\never since she left Sutherland.  Indeed, is it not the\ndominant type in the whole ill-equipped, sore-tried human\nrace?  And does it not usually fail of recognition because so\nmany of us who are in fact weak, look--and feel--strong\nbecause we are sheltered by inherited money or by powerful\nfriends or relatives or by chance lodgment in a nook unvisited\nof the high winds of life in the open?  Susan liked Garvey at\nonce; they exchanged smiles and were friends.\n\nShe glanced round the room.  At the huge open window Brent,\nhis back to her, was talking earnestly to a big hatchet-faced\nman with a black beard.  Even as Susan glanced Brent closed\nthe interview; with an emphatic gesture of fist into palm he\nexclaimed, \"And that's final.  Good-by.\"  The two men came\ntoward her, both bowed, the hatchet-faced man entered the\nelevator and was gone.  Brent extended his hand with a smile.\n\n\"You evidently didn't come to work today,\" said he with a\ncareless, fleeting glance at the _grande toilette_.  \"But we\nare prepared against such tricks.  Garvey, take her down to\nthe rear dressing-room and have the maid lay her out a simple\ncostume.\"  To Susan, \"Be as quick as you can.\"  And he seated\nhimself at his desk and was reading and signing letters.\n\nSusan, crestfallen, followed Garvey down the stairway.  She\nhad confidently expected that he would show some appreciation\nof her toilette.  She knew she had never in her life looked so\nwell.  In the long glass in the dressing-room, while Garvey\nwas gone to send the maid, she inspected herself again.\nYes--never anything like so well.  And Brent had noted her\nappearance only to condemn it.  She was always telling herself\nthat she wished him to regard her as a working woman, a pupil\nin stagecraft.  But now that she had proof that he did so\nregard her, she was depressed, resentful.  However, this did\nnot last long.  While she was changing to linen skirt and\nshirtwaist, she began to laugh at herself.  How absurd she had\nbeen, thinking to impress this man who had known so many\nbeautiful women, who must have been satiated long ago with\nbeauty--she thinking to create a sensation in such a man, with\na simple little costume of her own crude devising.  She\nreappeared in the studio, laughter in her eyes and upon her\nlips.  Brent apparently did not glance at her; yet he said,\n\"What's amusing you?\"\n\nShe confessed all, on one of her frequent impulses to\ncandor--those impulses characteristic both of weak natures\nunable to exercise self-restraint and of strong natures,\nindifferent to petty criticism and misunderstanding, and\nabsent from vain mediocrity, which always has itself--that is,\nappearances--on its mind.  She described in amusing detail how\nshe had planned and got together the costume how foolish his\nreception of it had made her feel.  \"I've no doubt you guessed\nwhat was in my head,\" concluded she.  \"You see everything.\"\n\n\"I did notice that you were looking unusually well, and that\nyou felt considerably set up over it,\" said he.  \"But why not?\nVanity's an excellent thing.  Like everything else it's got to\nbe used, not misused.  It can help us to learn instead of\npreventing.\"\n\n\"I had an excuse for dressing up,\" she reminded him.  \"You\nsaid we were to dine together.  I thought you wouldn't want\nthere to be too much contrast between us.  Next time I'll be\nmore sensible.\"\n\n\"Dress as you like for the present,\" said he.  \"You can always\nchange here.  Later on dress will be one of the main things,\nof course.  But not now.  Have you learned the part?\"\n\nAnd they began.  She saw at the far end of the room a platform\nabout the height of a stage.  He explained that Garvey, with\nthe book of the play, would take the other parts in _Lola's_\nscenes, and sent them both to the stage.  \"Don't be nervous,\"\nGarvey said to her in an undertone.  \"He doesn't expect\nanything of you.  This is simply to get started.\"  But she\ncould not suppress the trembling in her legs and arms, the\nhysterical contractions of her throat.  However, she did\ncontrive to go through the part--Garvey prompting.  She knew\nshe was ridiculous; she could not carry out a single one of\nthe ideas of \"business\" which had come to her as she studied;\nshe was awkward, inarticulate, panic-stricken.\n\n\"Rotten!\" exclaimed Brent, when she had finished.  \"Couldn't\nbe worse therefore, couldn't be better.\"\n\nShe dropped to a chair and sobbed hysterically.\n\n\"That's right--cry it out,\" said Brent.  \"Leave us alone, Garvey.\"\n\nBrent walked up and down smoking until she lifted her head and\nglanced at him with a pathetic smile.  \"Take a cigarette,\" he\nsuggested.  \"We'll talk it over.  Now, we've got something to\ntalk about.\"\n\nShe found relief from her embarrassment in the cigarette.\n\"You can laugh at me now,\" she said.  \"I shan't mind.  In\nfact, I didn't mind, though I thought I did.  If I had, I'd\nnot have let you see me cry.\"\n\n\"Don't think I'm discouraged,\" said Brent.  \"The reverse.  You\nshowed that you have nerve a very different matter from\nimpudence.  Impudence fails when it's most needed.  Nerve\nmakes one hang on, regardless.  In such a panic as yours was,\nthe average girl would have funked absolutely.  You stuck it\nout.  Now, you and I will try _Lola's_ first entrance.  No,\ndon't throw away your cigarette.  _Lola_ might well come in\nsmoking a cigarette.\"  She did better.  What Burlingham had\nonce thoroughly drilled into her now stood her in good stead,\nand Brent's sympathy and enthusiasm gave her the stimulating\nsense that he and she were working together.  They spent the\nafternoon on the one thing--_Lola_ coming on, singing her gay\nsong, her halt at sight of _Santuzza_ and _Turiddu_, her look at\n_Santuzza_, at _Turiddu_, her greeting for each.  They tried it\ntwenty different ways.  They discussed what would have been in\nthe minds of all three.  They built up \"business\" for _Lola_, and\nfor the two others to increase the significance of _Lola's_ actions.\n\n\"As I've already told you,\" said he, \"anyone with a voice and\na movable body can learn to act.  There's no question about\nyour becoming a good actress.  But it'll be some time before\nI can tell whether you can be what I hope--an actress who\nshows no sign that she's acting.\"\n\nSusan showed the alarm she felt.  \"I'm afraid you'll find at\nthe end that you've been wasting your time,\" said she.\n\n\"Put it straight out of your head,\" replied he.  \"I never\nwaste time.  To live is to learn.  Already you've given me a\nnew play--don't forget that.  In a month I'll have it ready for\nus to use.  Besides, in teaching you I teach myself.  Hungry?\"\n\n\"No--that is, yes.  I hadn't thought of it, but I'm starved.\"\n\n\"This sort of thing gives one an appetite like a field hand.\"\nHe accompanied her to the door of the rear dressing-room on\nthe floor below.  \"Go down to the reception room when you're\nready,\" said he, as he left her to go on to his own suite to\nchange his clothes.  \"I'll be there.\"\n\nThe maid came immediately, drew a bath for her, afterward\nhelped her to dress.  It was Susan's first experience with a\nmaid, her first realization how much time and trouble one\nsaves oneself if free from the routine, menial things.  And\nthen and there a maid was set down upon her secret list of the\nluxurious comforts to which she would treat herself--_when?_\nThe craving for luxury is always a part, usually a powerful\npart, of an ambitious temperament.  Ambition is simply a\nvariously manifested and variously directed impulse toward\nimprovement--a discomfort so keen that it compels effort to\nchange to a position less uncomfortable.  There had never been\na time when luxury had not attracted her.  At the slightest\nopportunity she had always pushed out for luxuries--for better\nfood, better clothing, more agreeable surroundings.  Even in\nher worst hours of discouragement she had not really relaxed\nin the struggle against rags and dirt.  And when moral horror\nhad been blunted by custom and drink, physical horror had\nremained acute.  For, human nature being a development upward\nthrough the physical to the spiritual, when a process of\ndegeneration sets in, the topmost layers, the spiritual, wear\naway first--then those in which the spiritual is a larger\ningredient than the material--then those in which the material\nis the larger--and last of all those that are purely material.\nAs life educated her, as her intelligence and her knowledge\ngrew, her appreciation of luxury had grown apace and her\ndesire for it.  With most human beings, the imagination is a\nheavy bird of feeble wing; it flies low, seeing only the\nthings of the earth.  When they describe heaven, it has houses\nof marble and streets of gold.  Their pretense to sight of\nhigher things is either sheer pretense or sight at second\nhand.  Susan was of the few whose fancy can soar. She saw the\nearthy things; she saw the things of the upper regions also.\nAnd she saw the lower region from the altitudes of the\nhigher--and in their perspective.\n\nAs she and Brent stood together on the sidewalk before his\nhouse, about to enter his big limousine, his smile told her\nthat he had read her thought--her desire for such an\nautomobile as her very own.  \"I can't help it,\" said she.\n\"It's my nature to want these things.\"\n\n\"And to want them intelligently,\" said he.  \"Everybody wants,\nbut only the few want intelligently--and they get.  The three\nworst things in the world are sickness, poverty and obscurity.\nYour splendid health safeguards you against sickness.  Your\nlooks and your brains can carry you far away from the other\ntwo.  Your one danger is of yielding to the temptation to\nbecome the wife or the mistress of some rich man.  The\nprospect of several years of heart-breaking hard work isn't\nwildly attractive at twenty-two.\"\n\n\"You don't know me,\" said Susan--but the boast was uttered\nunder her breath.\n\nThe auto rushed up to Delmonico's entrance, came to a halt\nabruptly yet gently.  The attentiveness of the personnel, the\nstaring and whispering of the people in the palm room showed\nhow well known Brent was.  There were several women--handsome\nwomen of what is called the New York type, though it certainly\ndoes not represent the average New York woman, who is poorly\ndressed in flimsy ready-made clothes and has the mottled skin\nthat indicates bad food and too little sleep.  These handsome\nwomen were dressed beautifully as well as expensively, in\nmodels got in--not from--Paris.  One of them smiled sweetly at\nBrent, who responded, so Susan thought, rather formally.  She\nfelt dowdy in her home-made dress.  All her pride in it\nvanished; she saw only its defects.  And the gracefully\ncareless manner of these women--the manners of those who feel\nsure of themselves--made her feel \"green\" and out of place.\nShe was disgusted with the folly that had caused her to thrill\nwith pleasure when his order to his chauffeur at his door told\nher she was actually to be taken to one of the restaurants in\nwhich she had wished to exhibit herself with him.  She\nheartily wished she had insisted on going where she would have\nbeen as well dressed and as much at home as anyone there.\n\nShe lifted her eyes, to distract her mind from these\ndepressing sensations.  Brent was looking at her with that\namused, mocking yet sympathetic expression which was most\ncharacteristic of him.  She blushed furiously.\n\nHe laughed.  \"No, I'm not ashamed of your homemade dress,\"\nsaid he.  \"I don't care what is thought of me by people who\ndon't give me any money.  And, anyhow, you are easily the most\nunusual looking and the most tastefully dressed woman here.\nThe rest of these women are doomed for life to commonplace\nobscurity.  You----\n\n\"We'll see your name in letters of fire on the Broadway\ntemples of fame.\"\n\n\"I know you're half laughing at me,\" said Susan.  \"But I feel\na little better.\"\n\n\"Then I'm accomplishing my object.  Let's not think about\nourselves.  That makes life narrow.  Let's keep the thoughts\non our work--on the big splendid dreams that come to us and\ninvite us to labor and to dare.\"\n\nAnd as they lingered over the satisfactory dinner he had\nordered, they talked of acting--of the different roles of\n\"Cavalleria\" as types of fundamental instincts and actions--of\nhow best to express those meanings--how to fill out the\nskeletons of the dramatist into personalities actual and\nvivid.  Susan forgot where she was, forgot to be reserved with\nhim.  In her and Rod's happiest days she had never been free\nfrom the constraint of his and her own sense of his great\nsuperiority.  With Brent, such trifles of the petty personal\ndisappeared.  And she talked more naturally than she had since\na girl at her uncle's at Sutherland.  She was amazed by the\nfountain that had suddenly gushed forth in her mind at the\nconjuring of Brent's sympathy.  She did not recognize herself\nin this person so open to ideas, so eager to learn, so clear\nin the expression of her thoughts.  Not since the Burlingham\ndays had she spent so long a time with a man in absolute\nunconsciousness of sex.\n\nThey were interrupted by the intrusion of a fashionable young\nman with the expression of assurance which comes from the\npossession of wealth and the knowledge that money will buy\npractically everything and everybody.  Brent received him so\ncoldly that, after a smooth sentence or two, he took himself\noff stammering and in confusion.  \"I suppose,\" said Brent when\nhe was gone, \"that young ass hoped I would introduce him to\nyou and invite him to sit.  But you'll be tempted often enough\nin the next few years by rich men without my helping to put\ntemptation in your way,\"\n\n\"I've never been troubled thus far,\" laughed Susan.\n\n\"But you will, now.  You have developed to the point where\neveryone will soon be seeing what it took expert eyes to see\nheretofore.\"\n\n\"If I am tempted,\" said Susan, \"do you think I'll be able\nto resist?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" confessed Brent.  \"You have a strong sense of\nhonesty, and that'll keep you at work with me for a while.\nThen----\n\n\"If you have it in you to be great, you'll go on.  If you're\nmerely the ordinary woman, a little more intelligent, you'll\nprobably--sell out.  All the advice I have to offer is, don't\nsell cheap.  As you're not hampered by respectability or by\ninexperience, you needn't.\"  He reflected a moment, then\nadded,  \"And if you ever do decide that you don't care to go on\nwith a career, tell me frankly.  I may be able to help you in\nthe other direction.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Susan, her strange eyes fixed upon him.\n\n\"Why do you put so much gratitude in your tone and in your\neyes?\" asked he.\n\n\"I didn't put it there,\" she answered.  \"It--just came.  And\nI was grateful because--well, I'm human, you know, and it was\ngood to feel--that--that----\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said he, as she hesitated.\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll misunderstand.\"\n\n\"What does it matter, if I do?\"\n\n\"Well--you've acted toward me as if I were a mere machine that\nyou were experimenting with.\"\n\n\"And so you are.\"\n\n\"I understand that.  But when you offered to help me, if I\nhappened to want to do something different from what you want\nme to do, it made me feel that you thought of me as a human\nbeing, too.\"\n\nThe expression of his unseeing eyes puzzled her.  She became\nmuch embarrassed when he said,  \"Are you dissatisfied with\nSpenser?  Do you want to change lovers?  Are you revolving me\nas a possibility?\"\n\n\"I haven't forgotten what you said,\" she protested.\n\n\"But a few words from me wouldn't change you from a woman into\na sexless ambition.\"\n\nAn expression of wistful sadness crept into the violet-gray eyes,\nin contrast to the bravely smiling lips.  She was thinking of\nher birth that had condemned her to that farmer Ferguson, full\nas much as of the life of the streets, when she said:\n\n\"I know that a man like you wouldn't care for a woman of my sort.\"\n\n\"If I were you,\" said he gently, \"I'd not say those things\nabout myself.  Saying them encourages you to think them.  And\nthinking them gives you a false point of view.  You must learn\nto appreciate that you're not a sheltered woman, with\nreputation for virtue as your one asset, the thing that'll\nenable you to get some man to undertake your support.  You are\ndealing with the world as a man deals with it.  You must\ndemand and insist that the world deal with you on that\nbasis.\"  There came a wonderful look of courage and hope into\nthe eyes of Lorella's daughter.\n\n\"And the world will,\" he went on.  \"At least, the only part of\nit that's important to you--or really important in any way.\nThe matter of your virtue or lack of it is of no more\nimportance than is my virtue or lack of it.\"\n\n\"Do you _really_ believe that way?\" asked Susan, earnestly.\n\n\"It doesn't in the least matter whether I do or not,\" laughed\nhe.  \"Don't bother about what I think--what anyone thinks--of\nyou.  The point here, as always, is that you believe it,\nyourself.  There's no reason why a woman who is making a\ncareer should not be virtuous.  She will probably not get far\nif she isn't more or less so.  Dissipation doesn't help man or\nwoman, especially the ruinous dissipation of license in\npassion.  On the other hand, no woman can ever hope to make a\ncareer who persists in narrowing and cheapening herself with\nthe notion that her virtue is her all.  She'll not amount to\nmuch as a worker in the fields of action.\"\n\nSusan reflected, sighed.  \"It's very, very hard to get rid of\none's sex.\"\n\n\"It's impossible,\" declared he.  \"Don't try.  But don't let it\nworry you, either.\"\n\n\"Everyone can't be as strong as you are--so absorbed in a\ncareer that they care for nothing else.\"\n\nThis amused him.  With forearms on the edge of the table he\nturned his cigarette slowly round between his fingers,\nwatching the smoke curl up from it.  She observed that there\nwas more than a light sprinkle of gray in his thick, carefully\nbrushed hair.  She was filled with curiosity as to the\nthoughts just then in that marvelous brain of his; nor did it\nlessen her curiosity to know that never would those thoughts\nbe revealed to her.  What women had he loved?  What women had\nloved him?  What follies had he committed?  From how many\nsources he must have gathered his knowledge of human nature\nof--woman nature!  And no doubt he was still gathering.\nWhat woman was it now?\n\nWhen he lifted his glance from the cigarette, it was to call\nthe waiter and get the bill.  \"I've a supper engagement,\" he\nsaid, \"and it's nearly eleven o'clock.\"\n\n\"Eleven o'clock!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Times does fly--doesn't it?--when a man and a woman, each an\nunexplored mystery to the other, are dining alone and talking\nabout themselves.\"\n\n\"It was my fault,\" said Susan.\n\nHis quizzical eyes looked into hers--uncomfortably far.\n\nShe flushed.  \"You make me feel guiltier than I am,\" she\nprotested, under cover of laughing glance and tone of raillery.\n\n\"Guilty?  Of what?\"\n\n\"You think I've been trying to--to 'encourage' you,\" replied\nshe frankly.\n\n\"And why shouldn't you, if you feel so inclined?\" laughed he.\n\"That doesn't compel me to be--encouraged.\"\n\n\"Honestly I haven't,\" said she, the contents of seriousness\nstill in the gay wrapper of raillery.  \"At least not any more\nthan----\"\n\n\"You know, a woman feels bound to 'encourage' a man who piques\nher by seeming--difficult.\"\n\n\"Naturally, you'd not have objected to baptizing the new hat\nand dress with my heart's blood.\"  She could not have helped\nlaughing with him.  \"Unfortunately for you--or rather for the\nnew toilette--my poor heart was bled dry long, long ago.  I'm\na busy man, too--busy and a little tired.\"\n\n\"I deserve it all,\" said she.  \"I've brought it on myself.\nAnd I'm not a bit sorry I started the subject.  I've found out\nyou're quite human--and that'll help me to work better.\"\n\nThey separated with the smiling faces of those who have added\nan evening altogether pleasant to memory's store of the past's\nhappy hours--that roomy storehouse which is all too empty even\nwhere the life has been what is counted happy.  He insisted on\nsending her home in his auto, himself taking a taxi to the\nPlayers' where the supper was given.  The moment she was alone\nfor the short ride home, her gayety evaporated like a\ndelicious but unstable perfume.\n\nWhy?  Perhaps it was the sight of the girls on the stroll.\nHad she really been one of them?--and only a few days ago?\nImpossible!  Not she not the real self . . . and perhaps she\nwould be back there with them before long.  No--never, never,\nin any circumstances!. . .  She had said, \"Never!\" the first\ntime she escaped from the tenements, yet she had gone back. . .\nwere any of those girls strolling along--were, again, any of\nthem Freddie Palmer's?  At the thought she shivered and\nquailed.  She had not thought of him, except casually, in many\nmonths.  What if he should see her, should still feel\nvengeful--he who never forgot or forgave--who would dare\nanything!  And she would be defenseless against him. . . .  She\nremembered what she had last read about him in the newspaper.\nHe had risen in the world, was no longer in the criminal class\napparently, had moved to the class of semi-criminal wholly\nrespectable contractor-politician.  No, he had long since\nforgotten her, vindictive Italian though he was.\n\nThe auto set her down at home.  Her tremors about Freddie\ndeparted; but the depression remained.  She felt physically as\nif she had been sitting all evening in a stuffy room with a\ndull company after a heavy, badly selected dinner.  She fell\neasy prey to one of those fits of the blues to which all\nimaginative young people are at least occasional victims, and\nby which those cursed and hampered with the optimistic\ntemperament are haunted and harassed and all but or quite\nundone.  She had a sense of failure, of having made a bad\nimpression.  She feared he, recalling and reinspecting what\nshe had said, would get the idea that she was not in earnest,\nwas merely looking for a lover--for a chance to lead a life of\nluxurious irresponsibility.  Would it not be natural for him,\nwho knew women well, to assume from her mistakenly candid\nremarks, that she was like the rest of the women, both the\nrespectable and the free?  Why should he believe in her, when\nshe did not altogether believe in herself but suspected\nherself of a secret hankering after something more immediate,\nmore easy and more secure than the stage career?  The longer\nshe thought of it the clearer it seemed to her to be that she\nhad once more fallen victim to too much hope, too much\noptimism, too much and too ready belief in her\nfellow-beings--she who had suffered so much from these\nfollies, and had tried so hard to school herself against them.\n\nShe fought this mood of depression--fought alone, for Spenser\ndid not notice and she would not annoy him.  She slept little\nthat night; she felt that she could not hope for peace until\nshe had seen Brent again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nTOWARD half-past ten the next day, a few minutes after Rod\nleft for the theater, she was in the bathroom cleaning the\ncoffee machine.  There came a knock at the door of the\nsitting-room bedroom.  Into such disorder had her mood of\ndepression worried her nerves that she dropped the coffee\nmachine into the washbowl and jumped as if she were seeing a\nghost.  Several dire calamities took vague shape in her mind,\nthen the image of Freddie Palmer, smiling sweetly, cruelly.\nShe wavered only a moment, went to the door, and after a brief\nhesitation that still further depressed her about herself she\nopened it.  The maid--a good-natured sloven who had become\ndevoted to Susan because she gave her liberal fees and made\nher no extra work--was standing there, in an attitude of\nsuppressed excitement.  Susan laughed, for this maid was a\nborn agitator, a person who is always trying to find a thrill\nor to put a thrill into the most trivial event.\n\n\"What is it now, Annie?\" Susan asked.\n\n\"Mr. Spenser--he's gone, hasn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes--a quarter of an hour ago.\"\n\nAnnie drew a breath of deep relief.  \"I was sure he had went,\"\nsaid she, producing from under her apron a note.  \"I saw it\nwas in a gentleman's writing, so I didn't come up with it till\nhe was out of the way, though the boy brought it a little\nafter nine.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother!\" exclaimed Susan, taking the note.\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Spenser, I've had my lesson,\" replied Annie,\napologetic but firm.  \"When I first came to New York, green as\nthe grass that grows along the edge of the spring, what does\nI do but go to work and take up a note to a lady when her\nhusband was there!  Next thing I knew he went to work and\nhauled her round the floor by the hair and skinned out--yes,\nbeat it for good.  And my madam says to me, 'Annie, you're\nfired.  Never give a note to a lady when her gent is by or to\na gent when his lady's by.  That's the first rule of life in gay\nNew York.' And you can bet I never have since--nor never will.\"\n\nSusan had glanced at the address on the note, had recognized\nthe handwriting of Brent's secretary.  Her heart had\nstraightway sunk as if the foreboding of calamity had been\nrealized.  As she stood there uncertainly, Annie seized the\nopportunity to run on and on.  Susan now said absently, \"Thank\nyou.  Very well,\" and closed the door.  It was a minute or so\nbefore she tore open the envelope with an impatient gesture\nand read:\n\n\nDEAR MRS. SPENSER:\n\nMr. Brent requests me to ask you not to come until further\nnotice.  It may be sometime before he will be free to resume.\n\n                                Yours truly,\n                                        JOHN C. GARVEY.\n\n\nIt was a fair specimen of Garvey's official style, with which\nshe had become acquainted--the style of the secretary who has\nlearned by experience not to use frills or flourishes but to\nconvey his message in the fewest and clearest words.  Had it\nbeen a skillfully worded insult Susan, in this mood of\ndepression and distorted mental vision, could not have\nreceived it differently.  She dropped to a chair at the table\nand stared at the five lines of neat handwriting until her\neyes became circled and her face almost haggard.  Precisely as\nRod had described!  After a long, long time she crumpled the\npaper and let it fall into the waste-basket.  Then she walked\nup and down the room--presently drifted into the bathroom and\nresumed cleaning the coffee machine.  Every few moments she\nwould pause in the task--and in her dressing afterwards--would\nbe seized by the fear, the horror of again being thrust into\nthat hideous underworld.  What was between her and it, to save\nher from being flung back into its degradation?  Two men on\nneither of whom she could rely.  Brent might drop her at any\ntime--perhaps had already dropped her.  As for Rod--vain,\ncapricious, faithless, certain to become an unendurable\ntyrant if he got her in his power--Rod was even less of a\nnecessity than Brent.  What a dangerous situation was hers!\nHow slender her chances of escape from another catastrophe.\nShe leaned against wall or table and was shaken by violent\nfits of shuddering.  She felt herself slipping--slipping.  It\nwas all she could do to refrain from crying out.  In those\nmoments, no trace of the self-possessed Susan the world always\nsaw.  Her fancy went mad and ran wild.  She quivered under the\nactuality of coarse contacts--Mrs. Tucker in bed with her--the\nmen who had bought her body for an hour--the vermin of the\ntenements--the brutal hands of policemen.\n\nThen with an exclamation of impatience or of anger she would\nshake herself together and go resolutely on--only again to\nrelapse.  \"Because I so suddenly cut off the liquor and the\nopium,\" she said.  It was the obvious and the complete\nexplanation.  But her heart was like lead, and her sky like\nink.  This note, the day after having tried her out as a\npossibility for the stage and as a woman.  She stared down at\nthe crumpled note in the wast-basket.  That note--it was\nherself.  He had crumpled her up and thrown her into the\nwaste-basket, where she no doubt belonged.\n\nIt was nearly noon before she, dressed with unconscious care,\nstood in the street doorway looking about uncertainly as if\nshe did not know which way to turn.  She finally moved in the\ndirection of the theater where Rod's play was rehearsing.  She\nhad gone to none of the rehearsals because Rod had requested\nit.  \"I want you to see it as a total surprise the first\nnight,\" explained he.  \"That'll give you more pleasure, and\nalso it will make your criticism more valuable to us.\"  And\nshe had acquiesced, not displeased to have all her time for\nher own affairs.  But now she, dazed, stunned almost,\nconvinced that it was all over for her with Brent,\ninstinctively turned to Rod to get human help--not to ask for\nit, but in the hope that somehow he would divine and would say\nor do something that would make the way ahead a little less\nforbidding--something that would hearten her for the few first\nsteps, anyhow.  She turned back several times--now, because\nshe feared Rod wouldn't like her coming; again because her\nexperience--enlightened good sense--told her that Rod\nwould--could--not help her, that her sole reliance was\nherself.  But in the end, driven by one of those spasms of\nterror lest the underworld should be about to engulf her\nagain, she stood at the stage door.\n\nAs she was about to negotiate the surly looking man on guard\nwithin, Sperry came rushing down the long dark passageway.  He\nwas brushing past her when he saw who it was.  \"Too late!\" he\ncried.  \"Rehearsal's over.\"\n\n\"I didn't come to the rehearsal,\" explained Susan.  \"I thought\nperhaps Rod would be going to lunch.\"\n\n\"So he is.  Go straight back.  You'll find him on the stage.\nI'll join you if you'll wait a minute or so.\"  And Sperry\nhurried on into the street.\n\nSusan advanced along the passageway cautiously as it was but\none remove from pitch dark.  Perhaps fifty feet, and she came\nto a cross passage.  As she hesitated, a door at the far end\nof it opened and she caught a glimpse of a dressing-room and,\nin the space made by the partly opened door, a woman\nhalf-dressed--an attractive glimpse.  The woman--who seemed\nyoung--was not looking down the passage, but into the room.\nShe was laughing in the way a woman laughs only when it is for\na man, for _the_ man--and was saying, \"Now, Rod, you must go,\nand give me a chance to finish dressing.\"  A man's arm--Rod's\narm--reached across the opening in the doorway.  A hand--Susan\nrecognized Rod's well-shaped hand--was laid strongly yet\ntenderly upon the pretty bare arm of the struggling, laughing\nyoung woman--and the door closed--and the passage was soot-dark\nagain.  All this a matter of less than five seconds.  Susan,\nashamed at having caught him, frightened lest she should be\nfound where she had no business to be, fled back along the\nmain passage and jerked open the street door.  She ran\nsquarely into Sperry.\n\n\"I--I beg your pardon,\" stammered he.  \"I was in such a\nrush--I ought to have been thinking where I was going.  Did I\nhurt you?\" This last most anxiously.  \"I'm so sorry----\"\n\n\"It's nothing--nothing,\" laughed Susan.  \"You are the one\nthat's hurt.\"\n\nAnd in fact she had knocked Sperry breathless.  \"You don't\nlook anything like so strong,\" gasped he.\n\n\"Oh, my appearance is deceptive--in a lot of ways.\"\n\nFor instance, he could have got from her face just then no\nhint of the agony of fear torturing her--fear of the drop into\nthe underworld.\n\n\"Find Rod?\" asked he.\n\n\"He wasn't on the stage.  So--I came out again.\"\n\n\"Wait here,\" said Sperry.  \"I'll hunt him up.\"\n\n\"Oh, no--please don't.  I stopped on impulse.  I'll not bother\nhim.\"  She smiled mischievously.  \"I might be interrupting.\"\n\nSperry promptly reddened.  She had no difficulty in reading\nwhat was in his mind--that her remark had reminded him of\nRod's \"affair,\" and he was cursing himself for having been so\nstupid as to forget it for the moment and put his partner in\ndanger of detection.\n\n\"I--I guess he's gone,\" stammered Sperry.  \"Lord, but that was\na knock you gave me!  Better come to lunch with me.\"\n\nSusan hesitated, a wistful, forlorn look in her eyes.  \"Do you\nreally want me?\" asked she.\n\n\"Come right along,\" said Sperry in a tone that left no doubt\nof his sincerity.  \"We'll go to the Knickerbocker and have\nsomething good to eat.\"\n\n\"Oh, no--a quieter place,\" urged Susan.\n\nSperry laughed.  \"You mean less expensive.  There's one of the\ngreat big differences between you and the make-believe ladies\none bumps into in this part of town.  _You_ don't like to be\ntroublesome or expensive.  But we'll go to the Knickerbocker.\nI feel 'way down today, and I intended to treat myself.  You\ndon't look any too gay-hearted yourself.\"\n\n\"I'll admit I don't like the way the cards are running,\" said\nSusan.  \"But--they'll run better--sooner or later.\"\n\n\"Sure!\" cried Sperry.  \"You needn't worry about the play.\nThat's all right.  How I envy women!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Oh--you have Rod between you and the fight.  While I--I've\ngot to look out for myself.\"\n\n\"So have I,\" said Susan.  \"So has everyone, for that matter.\"\n\n\"Believe me, Mrs. Spenser,\" cried Sperry, earnestly, \"you can\ncount on Rod.  No matter what----\"\n\n\"Please!\" protested Susan.  \"I count on nobody.  I learned\nlong ago not to lean.\"\n\n\"Well, leaning isn't exactly a safe position,\" Sperry\nadmitted.  \"There never was a perfectly reliable crutch.\nTell me your troubles.\"\n\nSusan smilingly shook her head.  \"That'd be leaning. . . .  No,\nthank you.  I've got to think it out for myself.  I believed\nI had arranged for a career for myself.  It seems to have gone\nto pieces  That's all.  Something else will turn up--after lunch.\"\n\n\"Not a doubt in the world,\" replied he confidently.\n\"Meanwhile--there's Rod.\"\n\nSusan's laugh of raillery made him blush guiltily.  \"Yes,\"\nsaid she, \"there's Rod.\"  She laughed again, merrily.\n\"There's Rod--but where is there?\"\n\n\"You're the only woman in the world he has any real liking\nfor,\" said Sperry, earnest and sincere.  \"Don't you ever doubt\nthat, Mrs. Spenser.\"\n\nWhen they were seated in the café and he had ordered, he\nexcused himself and Susan saw him make his way to a table\nwhere sat Fitzalan and another man who looked as if he too had\nto do with the stage.  It was apparent that Fitzalan was\nexcited about something; his lips, his arms, his head were in\nincessant motion.  Susan noted that he had picked up many of\nBrent's mannerisms; she had got the habit of noting this\nimitativeness in men--and in women, too--from having seen in\nthe old days how Rod took on the tricks of speech, manner,\nexpression, thought even, of whatever man he happened at the\ntime to be admiring.  May it not have been this trait of Rod's\nthat gave her the clue to his character, when she was thinking\nhim over, after the separation?\n\nSperry was gone nearly ten minutes.  He came, full of\napologies.  \"Fitz held on to me while he roasted Brent.\nYou've heard of Brent, of course?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Fitz has been seeing him off.  And he says it's----\"\n\nSusan glanced quickly at him.  \"Off?\" she said.\n\n\"To Europe.\"\n\nSusan had paused in removing her left glove.  Rod's description\nof Brent's way of sidestepping--Rod's description to the last\ndetail.  Her hands fluttered uncertainly--fluttering fingers\nlike a flock of birds flushed and confused by the bang of the gun.\n\n\"And Fitz says----\"\n\n\"For Europe,\" said Susan.  She was drawing her fingers slowly\none by one from the fingers of her glove.\n\n\"Yes.  He sailed, it seems, on impulse barely time to climb\naboard.  Fitz always lays everything to a woman.  He says\nBrent has been mixed up for a year or so with----  Oh, it\ndoesn't matter.  I oughtn't to repeat those things.  I don't\nbelieve 'em--on principle.  Every man--or woman--who amounts\nto anything has scandal talked about him or her all the time.\nGood Lord!  If Robert Brent bothered with half the affairs\nthat are credited to him, he'd have no time or strength--not\nto speak of brains--to do plays.\"\n\n\"I guess even the busiest man manages to fit a woman in\nsomehow,\" observed Susan.  \"A woman or so.\"\n\nSperry laughed.  \"I guess yes,\" said he.  \"But as to Brent,\nmost of the scandal about him is due to a fad of his--hunting\nfor an undeveloped female genius who----\"\n\n\"I've heard of that,\" interrupted Susan.  \"The service is\ndreadfully slow here.  How long is it since you ordered?\"\n\n\"Twenty minutes--and here comes our waiter.\"  And then, being\none of those who must finish whatever they have begun, he went\non.  \"Well, it's true Brent does pick up and drop a good many\nladies of one kind and another.  And naturally, every one of\nthem is good-looking and clever or he'd not start in.\nBut--you may laugh at me if you like--I think he's strictly\nbusiness with all of them.  He'd have got into trouble if he\nhadn't been.  And Fitz admits this one woman--she's a society\nwoman--is the only one there's any real basis for talk about\nin connection with Brent.\"\n\nSusan had several times lifted a spoonful of soup to her lips\nand had every time lowered it untasted.\n\n\"And Brent's mighty decent to those he tries and has to give\nup.  I know of one woman he carried on his pay roll for nearly\ntwo years----\"\n\n\"Let's drop Mr. Brent,\" cried Susan.  \"Tell me about--about\nthe play.\"\n\n\"Rod must be giving you an overdose of that.\"\n\n\"I've not seen much of him lately.  How was the rehearsal?\"\n\n\"Fair--fair.\"  And Sperry forgot Brent and talked on and on\nabout the play, not checking himself until the coffee was\nserved.  He had not observed that Susan was eating nothing.\nNeither had he observed that she was not listening; but there\nwas excuse for this oversight, as she had set her expression\nat absorbed attention before withdrawing within herself to\nthink--and to suffer.  She came to the surface again when\nSperry, complaining of the way the leading lady was doing her\npart, said:  \"No wonder Brent drops one after another.  Women\naren't worth much as workers.  Their real mind's always\noccupied with the search for a man to support 'em.\"\n\n\"Not always,\" cried Susan, quivering with sudden pain.  \"Oh,\nno, Mr. Sperry--not always.\"\n\n\"Yes--there are exceptions,\" said Sperry, not noting how he had\nwounded her.  \"But--well, I never happened to run across one.\"\n\n\"Can you blame them?\" mocked Susan.  She was ashamed that she\nhad been stung into crying out.\n\n\"To be honest--no,\" said Sperry.  \"I suspect I'd throw up the\nsponge and sell out if I had anything a lady with cash wanted\nto buy.  I only _suspect_ myself.  But I _know_ most men would.\nNo, I don't blame the ladies.  Why not have a nice easy time?\nOnly one short life--and then--the worms.\"\n\nShe was struggling with the re-aroused insane terror of a fall\nback to the depths whence she had once more just come--and she\nfelt that, if she fell again, it would mean the very end of\nhope.  It must have been instinct or accident, for it\ncertainly was not any prompting from her calm expression, that\nmoved him to say:\n\n\"Now, tell me _your_ troubles.  I've told you mine. . . .  You\nsurely must have some?\"\n\nSusan forced a successful smile of raillery.  \"None to speak\nof,\" evaded she.\n\nWhen she reached home there was a telegram--from Brent:\n\n\nCompelled to sail suddenly.  Shall be back in a few weeks.\nDon't mind this annoying interruption.  R. B.\n\n\nA very few minutes after she read these words, she was at work\non the play.  But--a very few minutes thereafter she was\nsitting with the play in her lap, eyes gazing into the black\nand menacing future.  The misgivings of the night before had\nbeen fed and fattened into despairing certainties by the\nevents of the day.  The sun was shining, never more brightly;\nbut it was not the light of her City of the Sun.  She stayed\nin all afternoon and all evening.  During those hours before\nshe put out the light and shut herself away in the dark a\nscore of Susans, every one different from every other, had\nbeen seen upon the little theater of that lodging house\nparlor-bedroom.  There had been a hopeful Susan, a sad but\nresolved Susan, a strong Susan, a weak Susan; there had been\nSusans who could not have shed a tear; there had been Susans\nwho shed many tears--some of them Susans all bitterness,\nothers Susans all humility and self-reproach.  Any spectator\nwould have been puzzled by this shifting of personality.\nSusan herself was completely confused.  She sought for her\nreal self among this multitude so contradictory.  Each\nsuccessive one seemed the reality; yet none persisted.  When\nwe look in at our own souls, it is like looking into a\nmany-sided room lined with mirrors.  We see\nreflections--re-reflections--views at all angles--but we\ncannot distinguish the soul itself among all these\ncounterfeits, all real yet all false because partial.\n\n\"What shall I do?  What can I do?  What will I do?\"--that was\nher last cry as the day ended.  And it was her first cry as\nher weary brain awakened for the new day.\n\n\nAt the end of the week came the regular check with a note from\nGarvey--less machine-like, more human.  He apologized for not\nhaving called, said one thing and another had prevented, and\nnow illness of a near relative compelled him to leave town for\na few days, but as soon as he came back he would immediately\ncall.  It seemed to Susan that there could be but one reason\nwhy he should call--the reason that would make a timid,\nsoft-hearted man such as he put off a personal interview as\nlong as he could find excuses.  She flushed hot with rage and\nshame as she reflected on her position.  Garvey pitying her!\nShe straightway sat down and wrote:\n\n\nDEAR MR. GARVEY:  Do not send me any more checks until Mr.\nBrent comes back and I have seen him.  I am in doubt whether\nI shall be able to go on with the work he and I had arranged.\n\n\nShe signed this \"Susan Lenox\" and dispatched it.  At once she\nfelt better in spite of the fact that she had, with\ncharacteristic and fatal folly, her good sense warned her, cut\nherself off from all the income in sight or in prospect.  She\nhad debated sending back the check, but had decided that if\nshe did she might give the impression of pique or anger.  No,\nshe would give him every chance to withdraw from a bargain\nwith which he was not content; and he would get the idea that\nit was she who was ending the arrangement, would therefore\nfeel no sense of responsibility for her.  She would save her\npride; she would spare his feelings.  She was taking counsel\nof Burlingham these days--was recalling the lesson he had\ntaught her, was getting his aid in deciding her course.\nBurlingham protested vehemently against this sending back of\nthe check; but she let her pride, her aversion to being an\nobject of pity, overrule him.\n\nA few days more, and she was so desperate, so harassed that\nshe altogether lost confidence in her own judgment.  While\noutwardly she seemed to be the same as always with Rod, she\nhad a feeling of utter alienation.  Still, there was no one\nelse to whom she could turn.  Should she put the facts before\nhim and ask his opinion?  Her intelligence said no; her heart\nsaid perhaps.  While she was hesitating, he decided for her.\nOne morning at breakfast he stopped talking about himself long\nenough to ask carelessly:\n\n\"About you and Brent--he's gone away.  What are you doing?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said she.\n\n\"Going to take that business up again, when he comes back?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't count on it, if I were you. . . .  You're so\nsensitive that I've hesitated to say anything.  But I think\nthat chap was looking for trouble, and when he found you were\nalready engaged, why, he made up his mind to drop it.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said Susan indifferently.  \"More coffee?\"\n\n\"Yes--a little.  If my play's as good as your coffee----\nThat's enough, thanks. . . .  Do you still draw your--your----\"\n\nHis tone as he cast about for a fit word made her flush\nscarlet.  \"No--I stopped it until we begin work again.\"\n\nHe did not conceal his thorough satisfaction.  \"That's right!\"\nhe cried.  \"The only cloud on our happiness is gone.  You\nknow, a man doesn't like that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Susan drily.\n\nAnd she understood why that very night he for the first time\nasked her to supper after the rehearsal with Sperry and\nConstance Francklyn, the leading lady, with whom he was having\none of those affairs which as he declared to Sperry were\n\"absolutely necessary to a man of genius to keep him freshened\nup--to keep the fire burning brightly.\"  He had carefully\ncoached Miss Francklyn to play the part of unsuspected\n\"understudy\"--Susan saw that before they had been seated in\nJack's ten minutes.  And she also saw that he was himself\nresolved to conduct himself \"like a gentleman.\"  But after he\nhad taken two or three highballs, Susan was forced to engage\ndeeply in conversation with the exasperated and alarmed Sperry\nto avoid seeing how madly Rod and Constance were flirting.\nShe, however, did contrive to see nothing--at least, the other\nthree were convinced that she had not seen.  When they were\nback in their rooms, Rod--whether through pretense or through\nsidetracked amorousness or from simple intoxication--became\nmore demonstrative than he had been for a long time.\n\n\"No, there's nobody like you,\" he declared.  \"Even if I\nwandered I'd always come back to you.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Susan with careless irony.  \"That's good.  No,\nI can unhook my blouse.\"\n\n\"I do believe you're growing cold.\"\n\n\"I don't feel like being messed with tonight.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" said he sulkily.  Then, forgetting his ill\nhumor after a few minutes of watching her graceful movements\nand gestures as she took off her dress and made her beautiful\nhair ready for the night, he burst out in a very different\ntone:  \"You don't know how glad I am that you're dependent on\nme again.  You'll not be difficult any more.\"\n\nA moment's silence, then Susan, with a queer little laugh,\n\"Men don't in the least mind--do they?\"\n\n\"Mind what?\"\n\n\"Being loved for money.\"  There was a world of sarcasm in her\naccent on that word loved.\n\n\"Oh, nonsense.  You don't understand yourself,\" declared he\nwith large confidence.  \"Women never grow up.  They're like\nbabies--and babies, you know, love the person that feeds them.\"\n\n\"And dogs--and cats--and birds--and all the lower orders.\"\nShe took a book and sat in a wrapper under the light.\n\n\"Come to bed--please, dear,\" pleaded he.\n\n\"No, I'll read a while.\"\n\nAnd she held the book before her until he was asleep.  Then\nshe sat a long time, her elbows on her knees, her chin\nsupported by her hands, her gaze fixed upon his face--the face\nof the man who was her master now.  She must please him, must\naccept what treatment he saw fit to give, must rein in her\nambitions to suit the uncertain gait and staying power of his\nability to achieve.  She could not leave him; he could leave\nher when he might feel so inclined.  Her master--capricious,\ntyrannical, a drunkard.  Her sole reliance--and the first\ncondition of his protection was that she should not try to do\nfor herself.  A dependent, condemned to become even more dependent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nSHE now spent a large part of every day in wandering, like a\nderelict, drifting aimlessly this way or that, up into the\nPark or along Fifth Avenue.  She gazed intently into shop\nwindows, apparently inspecting carefully all the articles on\ndisplay; but she passed on, unconscious of having seen\nanything.  If she sat at home with a book she rarely turned a\npage, though her gaze was fastened upon the print as if she\nwere absorbingly interested.\n\nWhat was she feeling?  The coarse contacts of street life and\ntenement life--the choice between monstrous defilements from\nhuman beings and monstrous defilements from filth and vermin.\nWhat was she seeing?  The old women of the slums--the forlorn,\naloof figures of shattered health and looks--creeping along\nthe gutters, dancing in the barrel houses, sleeping on the\nfloor in some vile hole in the wall--sleeping the sleep from\nwhich one awakes bitten by mice and bugs, and swarming with lice.\n\nShe had entire confidence in Brent's judgment.  Brent must\nhave discovered that she was without talent for the stage--for\nif he had thought she had the least talent, would he not in\nhis kindness have arranged or offered some sort of place in\nsome theater or other?  Since she had no stage\ntalent--then--what should she do?  What _could_ she do?  And so\nher mind wandered as aimlessly as her wandering steps.  And\nnever before had the sweet melancholy of her eyes been so moving.\n\nBut, though she did not realize it, there was a highly\nsignificant difference between this mood of profound\ndiscouragement and all the other similar moods that had\naccompanied and accelerated her downward plunges.  Every time\ntheretofore, she had been cowed by the crushing mandate of\ndestiny--had made no struggle against it beyond the futile\nthreshings about of aimless youth.  This time she lost neither\nstrength nor courage.  She was no longer a child; she was no\nlonger mere human flotsam and jetsam.  She did not know which\nway to turn; but she did know, with all the certainty of a\ndauntless will, that she would turn some way--and that it\nwould not be a way leading back to the marshes and caves of\nthe underworld.  She wandered--she wandered aimlessly; but not\nfor an instant did she cease to keep watch for the right\ndirection--the direction that would be the best available in\nthe circumstances.  She did not know or greatly care which way\nit led, so long as it did not lead back whence she had come.\n\nIn all her excursions she had--not consciously but by\ninstinct--kept away from her old beat.  Indeed, except in the\ncompany of Spenser or Sperry she had never ventured into the\nneighborhood of Long Acre.  But one day she was deflected by\nchance at the Forty-second Street corner of Fifth Avenue and\ndrifted westward, pausing at each book stall to stare at the\ntitles of the bargain offerings in literature.  As she stood\nat one of these stalls near Sixth Avenue, she became conscious\nthat two men were pressing against her, one on either side.\nShe moved back and started on her way.  One of the men was\nstanding before her.  She lifted her eyes, was looking into\nthe cruel smiling eyes of a man with a big black mustache and\nthe jaws of a prizefighter.  His smile broadened.\n\n\"I thought it was you, Queenie,\" said he.  \"Delighted to see you.\"\n\nShe recognized him as a fly cop who had been one of Freddie\nPalmer's handy men.  She fell back a step and the other\nman--she knew him instantly as also a policeman--lined up\nbeside him of the black mustache.  Both men were laughing.\n\n\"We've been on the lookout for you a long time, Queenie,\" said\nthe other.  \"There's a friend of yours that wants to see you\nmighty bad.\"\n\nSusan glanced from one to the other, her face pale but calm,\nin contrast to her heart where was all the fear and horror of\nthe police which long and savage experience had bred.  She\nturned away without speaking and started toward Sixth Avenue.\n\n\"Now, what d'ye think of that?\" said Black Mustache to his\n\"side kick.\"  \"I thought she was too much of a lady to cut an\nold friend.  Guess we'd better run her in, Pete.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" assented Pete.  \"Then we can keep her safe\ntill F. P. can get the hooks on her.\"\n\nBlack Mustache laughed, laid his hand on her arm.  \"You'll\ncome along quietly,\" said he.  \"You don't want to make a\nscene.  You always was a perfect lady.\"\n\nShe drew her arm away.  \"I am a married woman--living with\nmy husband.\"\n\nBlack Mustache laughed.  \"Think of that, Pete!  And she\nsoliciting us.  That'll be good news for your loving husband.\nCome along, Queenie.  Your record's against you.  Everybody'll\nknow you've dropped back to your old ways.\"\n\n\"I am going to my husband,\" said she quietly.  \"You had better\nnot annoy me.\"\n\nPete looked uneasy, but Black Mustache's sinister face became\nmore resolute.  \"If you wanted to live respectable, why did\nyou solicit us two?  Come along--or do you want me and Pete to\ntake you by the arms?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said she.  \"I'll go.\"  She knew the police, knew\nthat Palmer's lieutenant would act as he said--and she also\nknew what her \"record\" would do toward carrying through the plot.\n\nShe walked in the direction of the station house, the two\nplain clothes men dropping a few feet behind and rejoining her\nonly when they reached the steps between the two green lamps.\nIn this way they avoided collecting a crowd at their heels.\nAs she advanced to the desk, the sergeant yawning over the\nblotter glanced up.\n\n\"Bless my soul!\" cried he, all interest at once.  \"If it ain't\nF. P.'s Queenie!\"\n\n\"And up to her old tricks, sergeant,\" said Black Mustache.\n\"She solicited me and Pete.\"\n\nSusan was looking the sergeant straight in the eyes.  \"I am a\nmarried woman,\" said she.  \"I live with my husband.  I was\nlooking at some books in Forty-second Street when these two\ncame up and arrested me.\"\n\nThe sergeant quailed, glanced at Pete who was guiltily hanging\nhis head--glanced at Black Mustache.  There he got the support\nhe was seeking.  \"What's your husband's name?\" demanded Black\nMustache roughly.  \"What's your address?\"\n\nAnd Rod's play coming on the next night but one!  She shrank,\ncollected herself.  \"I am not going to drag him into this, if\nI can help it,\" said she.  \"I give you a chance to keep\nyourselves out of trouble.\"  She was gazing calmly at the\nsergeant again.  \"You know these men are not telling the\ntruth.  You know they've brought me here because of Freddie\nPalmer.  My husband knows all about my past.  He will stand by\nme.  But I wish to spare him.\"\n\nThe sergeant's uncertain manner alarmed Black Mustache.\n\"She's putting up a good, bluff\" scoffed he.  \"The truth is\nshe ain't got no husband.  She'd not have solicited us if she\nwas living decent.\"\n\n\"You hear what the officer says,\" said the sergeant, taking\nthe tone of great kindness.  \"You'll have to give your name\nand address--and I'll leave it to the judge to decide between\nyou and the officers.\"  He took up his pen.  \"What's your name?\"\n\nSusan, weak and trembling, was clutching the iron rail before\nthe desk--the rail worn smooth by the nervous hands of ten\nthousand of the social system's sick or crippled victims.\n\n\"Come--what's your name?\" jeered Black Mustache.\n\nSusan did not answer.\n\n\"Put her down Queenie Brown,\" cried he, triumphantly.\n\nThe sergeant wrote.  Then he said:  \"Age?\"\n\nNo answer from Susan.  Black Mustache answered for her:\n\"About twenty-two now.\"\n\n\"She don't look it,\" said the sergeant, almost at ease once\nmore.  \"But brunettes stands the racket better'n blondes.\nNative parents?\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"Native.  You don't look Irish or Dutch or Dago--though you\nmight have a dash of the Spinnitch or the Frog-eaters.  Ever\narrested before?\"\n\nNo answer from the girl, standing rigid at the bar.  Black\nMustache said:\n\n\"At least oncet, to my knowledge.  I run her in myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, she's got a record?\" exclaimed the sergeant, now wholly\nat ease.  \"Why the hell didn't you say so?\"\n\n\"I thought you remembered.  You took her pedigree.\"\n\n\"I do recollect now,\" said the sergeant.  \"Take my advice,\nQueenie, and drop that bluff about the officers lying.\nSwallow your medicine--plead guilty--and you'll get off with a\nfine.  If you lie about the police, the judge'll soak it to\nyou.  It happens to be a good judge--a friend of Freddie's.\"\nThen to the policemen:  \"Take her along to court, boys, and\nget back here as soon as you can.\"\n\n\"I want her locked up,\" objected Black Mustache.  \"I want F. P.\nto see her.  I've got to hunt for him.\"\n\n\"Can't do it,\" said the sergeant.  \"If she makes a yell about\npolice oppression, our holding on to her would look bad.  No,\nput her through.\"\n\nSusan now straightened herself and spoke.  \"I shan't make any\ncomplaint,\" said she.  \"Anything rather than court.  I can't\nstand that.  Keep me here.\"\n\n\"Not on your life!\" cried the sergeant.  \"That's a trick.\nShe'd have a good case against us.\"\n\n\"F. P.'ll raise the devil if----\" began Black Mustache.\n\n\"Then hunt him up right away.  To court she's got to go.  I\ndon't want to get broke.\"\n\nThe two men fell afoul each other with curse and abuse.  They\nwere in no way embarrassed by the presence of Susan.  Her\n\"record\" made her of no account either as a woman or as a\nwitness.  Soon each was so well pleased with the verbal wounds\nhe had dealt the other that their anger evaporated.  The\nupshot of the hideous controversy was that Black Mustache said:\n\n\"You take her to court, Pete.  I'll hunt up F. P.  Keep her\ntill the last.\"\n\nIn after days she could recall starting for the street car\nwith the officer, Pete; then memory was a blank until she was\nsitting in a stuffy room with a prison odor--the anteroom to\nthe court.  She and Pete were alone.  He was walking nervously\nup and down pulling his little fair mustache.  It must have\nbeen that she had retained throughout the impassive features\nwhich, however stormy it was within, gave her an air of\nstrength and calm.  Otherwise Pete would not presently have\nhalted before her to say in a low, agitated voice:\n\n\"If you can make trouble for us, don't do it.  I've got a\nwife, and three babies--one come only last week--and my old\nmother paralyzed.  You know how it is with us fellows--that\nwe've got to do what them higher up says or be broke.\"\n\nSusan made no reply.\n\n\"And F. P.--he's right up next the big fellows nowadays.  What\nhe says goes.  You can see for yourself how much chance\nagainst him there'd be for a common low-down cop.\"\n\nShe was still silent, not through anger as he imagined but\nbecause she had no sense of the reality of what was happening.\nThe officer, who had lost his nerve, looked at her a moment,\nin his animal eyes a humble pleading look; then he gave a\ngroan and turned away.  \"Oh, hell!\" he muttered.\n\nAgain her memory ceased to record until--the door swung open;\nshe shivered, thinking it was the summons to court.  Instead,\nthere stood Freddie Palmer.  The instant she looked into his\nface she became as calm and strong as her impassive expression\nhad been falsely making her seem.  Behind him was Black\nMustache, his face ghastly, sullen, cowed.  Palmer made a\njerky motion of head and arm.  Pete went; and the door closed\nand she was alone with him.\n\n\"I've seen the Judge and you're free,\" said Freddie.\n\nShe stood and began to adjust her hat and veil.\n\n\"I'll have those filthy curs kicked off the force.\"\n\nShe was looking tranquilly at him.\n\n\"You don't believe me?  You think I ordered it done?\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders.  \"No matter,\" she said.  \"It's\nundone now.  I'm much obliged.  It's more than I expected.\"\n\n\"You don't believe me--and I don't blame you.  You think I'm\nmaking some sort of grandstand play.\"\n\n\"You haven't changed--at least not much.\"\n\n\"I'll admit, when you left I was wild and did tell 'em to take\nyou in as soon as they found you.  But that was a long time\nago.  And I never meant them to disturb a woman who was living\nrespectably with her husband.  There may have been--yes, there\nwas a time when I'd have done that--and worse.  But not any\nmore.  You say I haven't changed.  Well, you're wrong.  In\nsome ways I have.  I'm climbing up, as I always told you I\nwould--and as a man gets up he sees things differently.  At\nleast, he acts differently.  I don't do _that_ kind of dirty\nwork, any more.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear it,\" murmured Susan for lack of anything\nelse to say.\n\nHe was as handsome as ever, she saw--had the same charm of\nmanner--a charm owing not a little of its potency to the\nimpression he made of the man who would dare as far as any\nman, and then go on to dare a step farther--the step from\nwhich all but the rare, utterly unafraid man shrinks.  His\nlook at her could not but appeal to her vanity as woman, and\nto her woman's craving for being loved; at the same time it\nagitated her with specters of the days of her slavery to him.\nHe said:\n\n\"_You_'ve changed--a lot.  And all to the good.  The only sign\nis rouge on your lips and that isn't really a sign nowadays.\nBut then you never did look the professional--and you weren't.\"\n\nHis eyes were appealingly tender as he gazed at her sweet,\npensive face, with its violet-gray eyes full of mystery and\nsorrow and longing.  And the clear pallor of her skin, and\nthe slender yet voluptuous lines of her form suggested a pale,\nbeautiful rose, most delicate of flowers yet about the hardiest.\n\n\"So--you've married and settled down?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Susan.  \"Neither the one nor the other.\"\n\n\"Why, you told----\"\n\n\"I'm supposed to be a married woman.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you give your name and address at the police\nstation?\" said he.  \"They'd have let you go at once.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" replied she.  \"But the newspapers would\nprobably have published it.  So--I couldn't.  As it is I've\nbeen worrying for fear I'd be recognized, and the man would\nget a write-up.\"\n\n\"That was square,\" said he.  \"Yes, it'd have been a dirty\ntrick to drag him in.\"\n\nIt was the matter-of-course to both of them that she should\nhave protected her \"friend.\"  She had simply obeyed about the\nmost stringent and least often violated article in the moral\ncode of the world of outcasts.  If Freddie's worst enemy in\nthat world had murdered him, Freddie would have used his last\nbreath in shielding him from the common foe, the law.\n\n\"If you're not married to him, you're free,\" said Freddie with\na sudden new kind of interest in her.\n\n\"I told you I should always be free.\"\n\nThey remained facing each other a moment.  When she moved to\ngo, he said:\n\n\"I see you've still got your taste in dress--only more so.\"\n\nShe smiled faintly, glanced at his clothing.  He was dressed\nwith real fashion.  He looked Fifth Avenue at its best, and\nhis expression bore out the appearance of the well-bred man of\nfortune.  \"I can return the compliment,\" said she.  \"And you\ntoo have improved.\"\n\nAt a glance all the old fear of him had gone beyond the\npossibility of return.  For she instantly realized that, like\nall those who give up war upon society and come in and\nsurrender, he was enormously agitated about his new status,\nwas impressed by the conventionalities to a degree that made\nhim almost weak and mildly absurd.  He was saying:\n\n\"I don't think of anything else but improving--in every way.\nAnd the higher I get the higher I want to go. . . .  That was a\ndreadful thing I did to you.  I wasn't to blame.  It was part\nof the system.  A man's got to do at every stage whatever's\nnecessary.  But I don't expect you to appreciate that.  I know\nyou'll never forgive me.\"\n\n\"I'm used to men doing dreadful things.\"\n\n\"_You_ don't do them.\"\n\n\"Oh, I was brought up badly--badly for the game, I mean.  But\nI'm doing better, and I shall do still better.  I can't\nabolish the system.  I can't stand out against it--and live.\nSo, I'm yielding--in my own foolish fashion.\"\n\n\"You don't lay up against me the--the--you know what I mean?\"\n\nThe question surprised her, so far as it aroused any emotion.\nShe answered indifferently:\n\n\"I don't lay anything up against anybody.  What's the use?  I\nguess we all do the best we can--the best the system'll let us.\"\n\nAnd she was speaking the exact truth.  She did not reason out\nthe causes of a state of mind so alien to the experiences of\nthe comfortable classes that they could not understand it,\nwould therefore see in it hardness of heart.  In fact, the\nheart has nothing to do with this attitude in those who are\nexposed to the full force of the cruel buffetings of the\nstorms that incessantly sweep the wild and wintry sea of\nactive life.  They lose the sense of the personal.  Where they\nyield to anger and revenge upon the instrument the blow fate\nhas used it to inflict, the resentment is momentary.  The mood\nof personal vengeance is characteristic of stupid people\nleading uneventful lives--of comfortable classes, of remote\nrural districts.  She again moved to go, this time putting out\nher hand with a smile.  He said, with an awkwardness most\nsignificant in one so supple of mind and manner:\n\n\"I want to talk to you.  I've got something to\npropose--something that'll interest you.  Will you give\nme--say, about an hour?\"\n\nShe debated, then smiled.  \"You will have me arrested if I refuse?\"\n\nHe flushed scarlet.  \"You're giving me what's coming to me,\"\nsaid he.  \"The reason--one reason--I've got on so well is that\nI've never been a liar.\"\n\n\"No--you never were that.\"\n\n\"You, too.  It's always a sign of bravery, and bravery's the\none thing I respect.  Yes, what I said I'd do always I did.\nThat's the only way to get on in politics--and the crookeder\nthe politics the more careful a man has to be about acting on\nthe level.  I can borrow a hundred thousand dollars without\nsigning a paper--and that's more than the crooks in Wall\nStreet can do--the biggest and best of them.  So, when I told\nyou how things were with me about you, I was on the level.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" said Susan.  \"Where shall we go?  I can't ask you\nto come home with me.\"\n\n\"We might go to tea somewhere----\"\n\nSusan laughed outright.  Tea!  Freddie Palmer proposing tea!\nWhat a changed hooligan--how ridiculously changed!  The other\nFreddie Palmer--the real one--the fascinating repelling\nmixture of all the barbaric virtues and vices must still be\nthere.  But how carefully hidden--and what strong provocation\nwould be needed to bring that savage to the surface again.\nThe Italian in him, that was carrying him so far so cleverly,\nenabled him instantly to understand her amusement.  He echoed\nher laugh.  Said he:\n\n\"You've no idea the kind of people I'm traveling with--not\npolitical swells, but the real thing.  What do you say to\nthe Brevoort?\"\n\nShe hesitated.\n\n\"You needn't be worried about being seen with me, no matter\nhow high you're flying,\" he hastened to say.  \"I always did\nkeep myself in good condition for the rise.  Nothing's known\nabout me or ever will be.\"\n\nThe girl was smiling at him again.  \"I wasn't thinking of\nthose things,\" said she.  \"I've never been to the Brevoort.\"\n\n\"It's quiet and respectable.\"\n\nSusan's eyes twinkled.  \"I'm glad it's respectable,\" said she.\n\"Are you quite sure _you_ can afford to be seen with _me?_  It's\ntrue they don't make the fuss about right and wrong side of\nthe line that they did a few years ago.  They've gotten a\nmetropolitan morality.  Still--I'm not respectable and never\nshall be.\"\n\n\"Don't be too hasty about that,\" protested he, gravely.  \"But\nwait till you hear my proposition.\"\n\nAs they walked through West Ninth Street she noted that there\nwas more of a physical change in him than she had seen at\nfirst glance.  He was less athletic, heavier of form and his\nface was fuller.  \"You don't keep in as good training as you\nused,\" said she.\n\n\"It's those infernal automobiles,\" cried he.  \"They're death\nto figure--to health, for that matter.  But I've got the\nhabit, and I don't suppose I'll ever break myself of it.  I've\ntaken on twenty pounds in the past year, and I've got myself\nso upset that the doctor has ordered me abroad to take a cure.\nThen there's champagne.  I can't let that alone, either,\nthough I know it's plain poison.\"\n\nAnd when they were in the restaurant of the Brevoort he\ninsisted on ordering champagne--and left her for a moment to\ntelephone for his automobile.  It amused her to see a man so\nmasterful thus pettily enslaved.  She laughed at him, and he\nagain denounced himself as a weak fool.  \"Money and luxury are\ntoo much for me.  They are for everybody.  I'm not as strong\nwilled as I used to be,\" he said.  \"And it makes me uneasy.\nThat's another reason for my proposition.\"\n\n\"Well--let's hear it,\" said she.  \"I happen to be in a\nposition where I'm fond of hearing propositions--even if I\nhave no intention of accepting.\"\n\nShe was watching him narrowly.  The Freddie Palmer he was\nshowing to her was a surprising but perfectly logical\ndevelopment of a side of his character with which she had been\nfamiliar in the old days; she was watching for that other\nside--the sinister and cruel side.  \"But first,\" he went on,\n\"I must tell you a little about myself.  I think I told you\nonce about my mother and father?\"\n\n\"I remember,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Well, honestly, do you wonder that I was what I used to be?\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered.  \"I wonder that you are what you _seem_ to be.\"\n\n\"What I come pretty near being,\" cried he.  \"The part that's\nmore or less put on today is going to be the real thing\ntomorrow.  That's the way it is with life--you put on a thing,\nand gradually learn to wear it.  And--I want you to help me.\"\n\nThere fell silence between them, he gazing at his glass of\nchampagne,  turning it round and round between his long\nwhite fingers and watching the bubbles throng riotously up\nfrom the bottom.  \"Yes,\" he said thoughtfully, \"I want you to\nhelp me.  I've been waiting for you.  I knew you'd turn up\nagain.\"  He laughed.  \"I've been true to you in a way--a man's\nway.  I've hunted the town for women who suggested you--a poor\nsort of makeshift--but--I had to do something.\"\n\n\"What were you going to tell me?\"\n\nHer tone was business-like.  He did not resent it, but\nstraightway acquiesced.  \"I'll plunge right in.  I've been, as\nyou know, a bad one--bad all my life.  I was born bad.  You\nknow about my mother and father.  One of my sisters died in a\ndisreputable resort.  The other--well, the last I heard of\nher, she was doing time in an English pen.  I've got a\nbrother--he's a degenerate.  Well!--not to linger over rotten\nsmells, I was the only one of the family that had brains.  I\nsoon saw that everybody who gets on in the world is bad--which\nsimply means doing disturbing things of one kind and another.\nAnd I saw that the ordinary crooks let their badness run their\nbrains, while the get-on kind of people let their brains run\ntheir badness.  You can be rotten--and sink lower and lower\nevery day.  Or you can gratify your natural taste for\nrottenness and at the same time get up in the world.  I made up\nmy mind to do the rotten things that get a man money and power.\"\n\n\"Respectability,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Respectability exactly.  So I set out to improve my brains.\nI went to night school and read and studied.  And I didn't\nstay a private in the gang of toughs.  I had the brains to be\nleader, but the leader's got to be a fighter too.  I took up\nboxing and made good in the ring.  I got to be leader.  Then\nI pushed my way up where I thought out the dirty work for the\nothers to do, and I stayed under cover and made 'em bring the\nbig share of the profits to me.  And they did it because I had\nthe brains to think out jobs that paid well and that could be\npulled off without getting pinched--at least, not always\ngetting pinched.\"\n\nPalmer sipped his champagne, looked at her to see if she was\nappreciative.  \"I thought you'd understand,\" said he.  \"I\nneedn't go into details.  You remember about the women?\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember,\" said Susan.  \"That was one step in the\nladder up?\"\n\n\"It got me the money to make my first play for respectability.\nI couldn't have got it any other way.  I had extravagant\ntastes--and the leader has to be always giving up to help this\nfellow and that out of the hole.  And I never did have luck\nwith the cards and the horses.\"\n\n\"Why did you want to be respectable?\" she asked.\n\n\"Because that's the best graft,\" explained he.  \"It means the\nmost money, and the most influence.  The coyotes that raid the\nsheep fold don't get the big share--though they may get a good\ndeal.  No, it's the shepherds and the owners that pull off the\nmost.  I've been leader of coyotes.  I'm graduating into\nshepherd and proprietor.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Susan.  \"You make it beautifully clear.\"\n\nHe bowed and smiled.  \"Thank you, kindly.  Then, I'll go on.\nI'm deep in the contracting business now.  I've got a pot of\nmoney put away.  I've cut out the cards--except a little\ngentlemen's game now and then, to help me on with the right\nkind of people.  Horses, the same way.  I've got my political\npull copper-riveted.  It's as good with the Republicans as\nwith Democrats, and as good with the reform crowd as with\neither.  My next move is to cut loose from the gang.  I've put\na lot of lieutenants between me and them, instead of dealing\nwith them direct.  I'm putting in several more fellows I'm not\nashamed to be seen with in Delmonico's.\"\n\n\"What's become of Jim?\" asked Susan.\n\n\"Dead--a kike shot him all to pieces in a joint in Seventh\nAvenue about a month ago.  As I was saying, how do these big\nmulti-millionaires do the trick?  They don't tell somebody to\ngo steal what they happen to want.  They tell somebody they\nwant it, and that somebody else tells somebody else to get it,\nand that somebody else passes the word along until it reaches\nthe poor devils who must steal it or lose their jobs.  I\nstudied it all out, and I've framed up my game the same way.\nNowadays, every dollar that comes to me has been thoroughly\ncleaned long before it drops into my pocket.  But you're\nwondering where _you_ come in.\"\n\n\"Women are only interested in what's coming to them,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Sensible men are the same way.  The men who aren't--they work\nfor wages and salaries.  If you're going to live off of other\npeople, as women and the rich do, you've got to stand steady,\nday and night, for Number One.  And now, here's where _you_\ncome in.  You've no objection to being respectable?\"\n\n\"I've no objection to not being disreputable.\"\n\n\"That's the right way to put it,\" he promptly agreed.\n\"Respectable, you know, doesn't mean anything but appearances.\nPeople who are really respectable, who let it strike in,\ninstead of keeping it on the outside where it belongs--they\nsoon get poor and drop down and out.\"\n\nPalmer's revelation of himself and of a philosophy which life\nas it had revealed itself to her was incessantly urging her to\nadopt so grappled her attention that she altogether forgot\nherself.  A man on his way to the scaffold who suddenly sees\nand feels a cataclysm rocking the world about him forgets his\nown plight.  Unconsciously he was epitomizing, unconsciously\nshe was learning, the whole story of the progress of the race\nupward from beast toward intellect--the brutal and bloody\nbuilding of the highway from the caves of darkness toward the\npeaks of light.  The source from which springs, and ever has\nsprung, the cruelty of man toward man is the struggle of the\nambition of the few who see and insist upon better conditions,\nwith the inertia and incompetence of the many who have little\nsight and less imagination.  Ambition must use the inert\nmass--must persuade it, if possible, must compel it by trick\nor force if persuasion fails.  But Palmer and Susan Lenox\nwere, naturally, not seeing the thing in the broad but only as\nit applied to themselves.\n\n\"I've read a whole lot of history and biography,\" Freddie\nwent on, \"and I've thought about what I read and about what's\ngoing on around me.  I tell you the world's full of cant.  The\npeople who get there don't act on what is always preached.\nThe preaching isn't all lies--at least, I think not.  But it\ndoesn't fit the facts a man or a woman has got to meet.\"\n\n\"I realized that long ago,\" said Susan.\n\n\"There's a saying that you can't touch pitch without being\ndefiled.  Well--you can't build without touching pitch--at\nleast not in a world where money's king and where those with\nbrains have to live off of those without brains by making 'em\nwork and showing 'em what to work at.  It's a hell of a world,\nbut _I_ didn't get it up.\"\n\n\"And we've got to live in it,\" said she, \"and get out of it\nthe things we want and need.\"\n\n\"That's the talk!\" cried Palmer.  \"I see you're 'on.' Now--to\nmake a long story short--you and I can get what we want.  We\ncan help each other.  You were better born than I am--you've\nhad a better training in manners and dress and all the classy\nsort of things.  I've got the money--and brains enough to\nlearn with--and I can help you in various ways.  So--I propose\nthat we go up together.\"\n\n\"We've got--pasts,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Who hasn't that amounts to anything?  Mighty few.  No one\nthat's made his own pile, I'll bet you.  I'm in a position to\ndo favors for people--the people we'd need.  And I'll get in a\nposition to do more and more.  As long as they can make something\nout of us--or hope to--do you suppose they'll nose into our pasts\nand root things up that'd injure them as much as us?\"\n\n\"It would be an interesting game, wouldn't it?\" said Susan.\n\nShe was reflectively observing the handsome, earnest face\nbefore her--an incarnation of intelligent ambition, a Freddie\nPalmer who was somehow divesting himself of himself--was\ngrowing up--away from the rotten soil that had nourished\nhim--up into the air--was growing strongly--yes, splendidly!\n\n\"And we've got everything to gain and nothing to lose,\"\npursued he.  \"We'd not be adventurers, you see.  Adventurers\nare people who haven't any money and are looking round to try\nto steal it.  We'd have money.  So, we'd be building solid,\nright on the rock.\"  The handsome young man--the strongest,\nthe most intelligent, the most purposeful she had ever met,\nexcept possibly Brent--looked at her with an admiring\ntenderness that moved her, the forlorn derelict adrift on the\nvast, lonely, treacherous sea.  \"The reason I've waited for\nyou to invite you in on this scheme is that I tried you out\nand I found that you belong to the mighty few people who do\nwhat they say they'll do, good bargain or bad.  It'd never\noccur to you to shuffle out of trying to keep your word.\"\n\n\"It hasn't--so far,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Well--that's the only sort of thing worth talking about as\nmorality.  Believe me, for I've been through the whole game\nfrom chimney pots to cellar floor.\"\n\n\"There's another thing, too,\" said the girl.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Not to injure anyone else.\"\n\nPalmer shook his head positively.  \"It's believing that and\nacting on it that has kept you down in spite of your brains\nand looks.\"\n\n\"That I shall never do,\" said the girl.  \"It may be\nweakness--I guess it is weakness.  But--I draw the line there.\"\n\n\"But I'm not proposing that you injure anyone--or proposing to\ndo it myself.  As I said, I've got up where I can afford to be\ngood and kind and all that.  And I'm willing to jump you up\nover the stretch of the climb that can't be crossed without\nbeing--well, anything but good and kind.\"\n\nShe was reflecting.\n\n\"You'll never get over that stretch by yourself.  It'll always\nturn you back.\"\n\n\"Just what do you propose?\" she asked.\n\nIt gave her pleasure to see the keen delight her question,\nwith its implication of hope, aroused in him.  Said he:\n\n\"That we go to Europe together and stay over there several\nyears--as long as you like as long as it's necessary.  Stay\ntill our pasts have disappeared--work ourselves in with the\nright sort of people.  You say you're not married?\"\n\n\"Not to the man I'm with.\"\n\n\"To somebody else?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  I was.\"\n\n\"Well--that'll be looked into and straightened out.  And then\nwe'll quietly marry.\"\n\nSusan laughed.  \"You're too fast,\" said she.  \"I'll admit I'm\ninterested.  I've been looking for a road--one that doesn't\nlead toward where we've come from.  And this is the first road\nthat has offered.  But I haven't agreed to go in with you\nyet--haven't even begun to think it over.  And if I did\nagree--which I probably won't--why, still I'd not be willing\nto marry.  That's a serious matter.  I'd want to be very, very\nsure I was satisfied.\"\n\nPalmer nodded, with a return of the look of admiration.  \"I\nunderstand.  You don't promise until you intend to stick, and\nonce you've promised all hell couldn't change you.\"\n\n\"Another thing--very unfortunate, too.  It looks to me as if\nI'd be dependent on you for money.\"\n\nFreddie's eyes wavered.  \"Oh, we'd never quarrel about that,\"\nsaid he with an attempt at careless confidence.\n\n\"No,\" replied she quietly.  \"For the best of reasons.  I'd not\nconsider going into any arrangement where I'd be dependent on\na man for money.  I've had my experience.  I've learned my\nlesson.  If I lived with you several years in the sort of\nstyle you've suggested--no, not several years but a few\nmonths--you'd have me absolutely at your mercy.  You'd\nthought of that, hadn't you?\"\n\nHis smile was confession.\n\n\"I'd develop tastes for luxuries and they'd become\nnecessities.\"  Susan shook her head.  \"No--that would be\nfoolish--very foolish.\"\n\nHe was watching her so keenly that his expression was covert\nsuspicion.  \"What do you suggest?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not what you suspect,\" replied she, amused.  \"I'm not making\na play for a gift of a fortune.  I haven't anything to suggest.\"\n\nThere was a long silence, he turning his glass slowly and from\ntime to time taking a little of the champagne thoughtfully.\nShe observed him with a quizzical expression.  It was apparent\nto her that he was debating whether he would be making a fool\nof himself if he offered her an independence outright.\nFinally she said:\n\n\"Don't worry, Freddie.  I'd not take it, even if you screwed\nyourself up to the point of offering it.\"\n\nHe glanced up quickly and guiltily.  \"Why not?\" he said.\n\"You'd be practically my wife.  I can trust you.  You've had\nexperience, so you can't blame me for hesitating.  Money puts\nthe devil in anybody who gets it--man or woman.  But I'll\ntrust you----\" he laughed--\"since I've got to.\"\n\n\"No.  The most I'd take would be a salary.  I'd be a sort\nof companion.\"\n\n\"Anything you like,\" cried he.  This last suspicion born of a\nlife of intimate dealings with his fellow-beings took flight.\n\"It'd have to be a big salary because you'd have to dress and\nact the part.  What do you say?  Is it a go?\"\n\n\"Oh, I can't decide now.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\nShe reflected.  \"I can tell you in a week.\"\n\nHe hesitated, said, \"All right--a week.\"\n\nShe rose to go.  \"I've warned you the chances are against my\naccepting.\"\n\n\"That's because you haven't looked the ground over,\" replied\nhe, rising.  Then, after a nervous moment, \"Is the--is the----\"\nHe stopped short.\n\n\"Go on,\" said she.  \"We must be frank with each other.\"\n\n\"If the idea of living with me is--is disagreeable----\"  And\nagain he stopped, greatly embarrassed--an amazing indication\nof the state of mind of such a man as he--of the depth of his\ninfatuation, of his respect, of his new-sprung awe of\nconventionality.\n\n\"I hadn't given it a thought,\" replied she.  \"Women are not\nespecially sensitive about that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"They're supposed to be.  And I rather thought you were.\"\n\nShe laughed mockingly.  \"No more than other women,\" said she.\n\"Look how they marry for a home--or money--or social\nposition--and such men!  And look how they live with men year\nafter year, hating them.  Men never could do that.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe it,\" replied he.  \"They can, and they do.\nThe kept man--in and out of marriage--is quite a feature of\nlife in our chaste little village.\"\n\nSusan looked amused.  \"Well--why not?\" said she.  \"Everybody's\nsimply got to have money nowadays.\"\n\n\"And working for it is slow and mighty uncertain.\"\n\nHer face clouded.  She was seeing the sad wretched past from\nfilthy tenement to foul workshop.  She said:\n\n\"Where shall I send you word?\"\n\n\"I've an apartment at Sherry's now.\"\n\n\"Then--a week from today.\"\n\nShe put out her hand.  He took it, and she marveled as she\nfelt a tremor in that steady hand of his.  But his voice was\nresolutely careless as he said, \"So long.  Don't forget how\nmuch I want or need you.  And if you do forget that, think of\nthe advantages--seeing the world with plenty of money--and all\nthe rest of it.  Where'll you get such another chance?  You'll\nnot be fool enough to refuse.\"\n\nShe smiled, said as she went, \"You may remember I used to be\nsomething of a fool.\"\n\n\"But that was some time ago.  You've learned a lot since\nthen--surely.\"\n\n\"We'll see.  I've become--I think--a good deal of a--of a New Yorker.\"\n\n\"That means frank about doing what the rest of the world does\nunder a stack of lies.  It's a lovely world, isn't it?\"\n\n\"If I had made it,\" laughed Susan, \"I'd not own up to the fact.\"\n\nShe laughed; but she was seeing the old women of the\nslums--was seeing them as one sees in the magic mirror the\nvision of one's future self.  And on the way home she said to\nherself, \"It was a good thing that I was arrested today.  It\nreminded me.  It warned me.  But for it, I might have gone on\nto make a fool of myself.\"  And she recalled how it had been\none of Burlingham's favorite maxims that everything is for the\nbest, for those who know how to use it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nSHE wrote Garvey asking an appointment.  The reply should have\ncome the next day or the next day but one at the farthest; for\nGarvey had been trained by Brent to the supreme courtesy of\npromptness.  It did not come until the fourth day; before she\nopened it Susan knew about what she would read--the stupidly\nobvious attempt to put off facing her--the cowardice of a\nkind-hearted, weak fellow.  She really had her answer--was\nleft without a doubt for hope to perch upon.  But she wrote\nagain, insisting so sharply that he came the following day.\nHis large, tell-tale face was a restatement of what she had\nread in his delay and between the lines of his note.  He was\neffusively friendly with a sort of mortuary suggestion, like\none bearing condolences, that tickled her sense of humor, far\nthough her heart was from mirth.\n\n\"Something has happened,\" began she, \"that makes it necessary\nfor me to know when Mr. Brent is coming back.\"\n\n\"Really, Mrs. Spencer----\"\n\n\"Miss Lenox,\" she corrected.\n\n\"Yes--Miss Lenox, I beg your pardon.  But really--in my\nposition--I know nothing of Mr. Brent's plans--and if I did,\nI'd not be at liberty to speak of them.  I have written him\nwhat you wrote me about the check--and--and--that is all.\"\n\n\"Mr. Garvey, is he ever--has he----\"  Susan, desperate, burst\nout with more than she intended to say:  \"I care nothing about\nit, one way or the other.  If Mr. Brent is politely hinting\nthat I won't do, I've a right to know it.  I have a chance at\nsomething else.  Can't you tell me?\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about it--honestly I don't, Miss\nLenox,\" cried he, swearing profusely.\n\n\"You put an accent on the 'know,'\" said Susan.  \"You suspect\nthat I'm right, don't you?\"\n\n\"I've no ground for suspecting--that is--no, I haven't.  He\nsaid nothing to me--nothing.  But he never does.  He's very\npeculiar and uncertain . . . and I don't understand him at all.\"\n\n\"Isn't this his usual way with the failures--his way of\nletting them down easily?\"\n\nSusan's manner was certainly light and cheerful, an assurance\nthat he need have no fear of hysterics or despair or any sort\nof scene trying to a soft heart.  But Garvey could take but\nthe one view of the favor or disfavor of the god of his\nuniverse.  He looked at her like a dog that is getting a\nwhipping from a friend.  \"Now, Miss Lenox, you've no right to\nput me in this painful----\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Susan, done since she had got what she\nsought.  \"I shan't say another word.  When Mr. Brent comes\nback, will you tell him I sent for you to ask you to thank him\nfor me--and say to him that I found something else for which\nI hope I'm better suited?\"\n\n\"I'm so glad,\" said Garvey, hysterically.  \"I'm delighted.\nAnd I'm sure he will be, too.  For I'm sure he liked you,\npersonally--and I must say I was surprised when he went.  But\nI must not say that sort of thing.  Indeed, I know nothing,\nMiss Lenox--I assure you----\"\n\n\"And please tell him,\" interrupted Susan, \"that I'd have\nwritten him myself, only I don't want to bother him.\"\n\n\"Oh, no--no, indeed.  Not that, Miss Lenox.  I'm so sorry.\nBut I'm only the secretary.  I can't say anything.\"\n\nIt was some time before Susan could get rid of him, though he\nwas eager to be gone.  He hung in the doorway, ejaculating\ndisconnectedly, dropping and picking up his hat, perspiring\nprofusely, shaking hands again and again, and so exciting her\npity for his misery of the good-hearted weak that she was for\nthe moment forgetful of her own plight.  Long before he went,\nhe had greatly increased her already strong belief in Brent's\ngenerosity of character--for, thought she, he'd have got\nanother secretary if he hadn't been too kind to turn adrift so\nhelpless and foolish a creature.  Well--he should have no\ntrouble in getting rid of her.\n\nShe was seeing little of Spenser and they were saying almost\nnothing to each other.  When he came at night, always very\nlate, she was in bed and pretended sleep.  When he awoke, she\ngot breakfast in silence; they read the newspapers as they\nate.  And he could not spare the time to come to dinner.  As\nthe decisive moment drew near, his fears dried up his\nconfident volubility.  He changed his mind and insisted on her\ncoming to the theater for the final rehearsals.  But\n\"Shattered Lives\" was not the sort of play she cared for, and\nshe was wearied by the profane and tedious wranglings of the\nstage director and the authors, by the stupidity of the actors\nwho had to be told every little intonation and gesture again\nand again.  The agitation, the labor seemed grotesquely out of\nproportion to the triviality of the matter at issue.  At the\nfirst night she sat in a box from which Spenser, in a high\nfever and twitching with nervousness, watched the play,\ngliding out just before the lights were turned up for the\nintermission.  The play went better than she had expected, and\nthe enthusiasm of the audience convinced her that it was a\nsuccess before the fall of the curtain on the second act.\nWith the applause that greeted the chief climax--the end of\nthe third act--Spenser, Sperry and Fitzalan were convinced.\nAll three responded to curtain calls.  Susan had never seen\nSpenser so handsome, and she admired the calmness and the\ncleverness of his brief speech of thanks.  That line of\nfootlights between them gave her a new point of view on him,\nmade her realize how being so close to his weaknesses had\nobscured for her his strong qualities--for, unfortunately,\nwhile a man's public life is determined wholly by his strong\nqualities, his intimate life depends wholly on his weaknesses.\nShe was as fond of him as she had ever been; but it was\nimpossible for her to feel any thrill approaching love. Why?\nShe looked at his fine face and manly figure; she recalled how\nmany good qualities he had.  Why had she ceased to love him?\nShe thought perhaps some mystery of physical lack of sympathy\nwas in part responsible; then there was the fact that she\ncould not trust him.  With many women, trust is not necessary\nto love; on the contrary, distrust inflames love.  It happened\nnot to be so with Susan Lenox.  \"I do not love him.  I can\nnever love him again.  And when he uses his power over me, I\nshall begin to dislike him.\"  The lost illusion!  The dead\nlove!  If she could call it back to life!  But no--there it lay,\ncoffined, the gray of death upon its features.  Her heart ached.\n\nAfter the play Fitzalan took the authors and the leading lady,\nConstance Francklyn, and Miss Lenox to supper in a private\nroom at Rector's.  This was Miss Francklyn's first trial in a\nleading part.  She had small ability as an actress, having\nnever risen beyond the primer stage of mere posing and\ndeclamation in which so many players are halted by their\nvanity--the universal human vanity that is content with small\ntriumphs, or with purely imaginary triumphs.  But she had a\nnotable figure of the lank, serpentine kind and a bad, sensual\nface that harmonized with it.  Especially in artificial light\nshe had an uncanny allure of the elemental, the wild animal in\nthe jungle.  With every disposition and effort to use her\nphysical charms to further herself she would not have been\nstill struggling at twenty-eight, had she had so much as a\nthimbleful of intelligence.\n\n\"Several times,\" said Sperry to Susan as they crossed Long\nAcre together on the way to Rector's, \"yes, at least half a\ndozen times to my knowledge, Constance had had success right\nin her hands.  And every time she has gone crazy about some\ncheap actor or sport and has thrown it away.\"\n\n\"But she'll get on now,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" was Sperry's doubting reply.  \"Of course, she's got\nno brains.  But it doesn't take brains to act--that is, to act\nwell enough for cheap machine-made plays like this.  And\nnowadays playwrights have learned that it's useless to try to\nget actors who can act.  They try to write parts that are\nactor-proof.\"\n\n\"You don't like your play?\" said Susan.\n\n\"Like it?  I love it.  Isn't it going to bring me in a pot of\nmoney?  But as a play\"--Sperry laughed.  \"I know Spenser\nthinks it's great, but--there's only one of us who can write\nplays, and that's Brent.  It takes a clever man to write a\nclever play.  But it takes a genius to write a clever play\nthat'll draw the damn fools who buy theater seats.  And Robert\nBrent now and then does the trick.  How are you getting on\nwith your ambition for a career?\"\n\nSusan glanced nervously at him.  The question, coming upon the\nheels of talk about Brent, filled her with alarm lest Rod had\nbroken his promise and had betrayed her confidence.  But\nSperry's expression showed that she was probably mistaken.\n\n\"My ambition?\" said she.  \"Oh--I've given it up.\"\n\n\"The thought of work was too much for you--eh?\"\n\nSusan shrugged her shoulders.\n\nA sardonic grin flitted over Sperry's Punch-like face.  \"The\nmore I see of women, the less I think of 'em,\" said he.  \"But\nI suppose the men'd be lazy and worthless too, if nature had\ngiven 'em anything that'd sell or rent. . . .  Somehow I'm\ndisappointed in _you_, though.\"\n\nThat ended the conversation until they were sitting down at\nthe table.  Then Sperry said:\n\n\"Are you offended by my frankness a while ago?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Susan.  \"The contrary.  Some day your saying\nthat may help me.\"\n\n\"It's quite true, there's something about you--a look--a\nmanner--it makes one feel you could do things if you tried.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that 'something' is a fraud,\" said she.  No doubt\nit was that something that had misled Brent--that had always\ndeceived her about herself.  No, she must not think herself a\nself-deceived dreamer.  Even if it was so, still she must not\nthink it.  She must say to herself over and over again \"Brent\nor no Brent, I shall get on--I shall get on\" until she had\nsilenced the last disheartening doubt.\n\nMiss Francklyn, with Fitzalan on her left and Spenser on her\nright, was seated opposite Susan.  About the time the third\nbottle was being emptied the attempts of Spenser and Constance\nto conceal from her their doings became absurd.  Long before\nthe supper was over there had been thrust at her all manner of\nproofs that Spenser was again untrue, that he was whirling\nmadly in one of those cyclonic infatuations which soon wore\nhim out and left him to return contritely to her.  Sperry\nadmired Susan's manners as displayed in her unruffled\nserenity--an admiration which she did not in the least\ndeserve.  She was in fact as deeply interested as she seemed\nin his discussion of plays and acting, illustrated by Brent's\nlatest production.  By the time the party broke up, Susan had\nin spite of herself collected a formidable array of\nincriminating evidence, including the stealing of one of\nConstance's jeweled show garters by Spenser under cover of the\ntablecloth and a swift kiss in the hall when Constance went\nout for a moment and Spenser presently suspended his drunken\npraises of himself as a dramatist, and appointed himself a\ncommittee to see what had become of her.\n\nAt the door of the restaurant, Spenser said:\n\n\"Susan, you and Miss Francklyn take a taxicab.  She'll drop\nyou at our place on her way home.  Fitz and Sperry and I want\none more drink.\"\n\n\"Not for me,\" said Sperry savagely, with a scowl at Constance.\nBut Fitzalan, whose arm Susan had seen Rod press, remained silent.\n\n\"Come on, my dear,\" cried Miss Francklyn, smiling sweet\ninsolent treachery into Susan's face.\n\nSusan smiled sweetly back at her.  As she was leaving the\ntaxicab in Forty-fifth Street, she said:\n\n\"Send Rod home by noon, won't you?  And don't tell him I know.\"\n\nMiss Francklyn, who had been drinking greedily, began to cry.\nSusan laughed.  \"Don't be a silly,\" she urged.  \"If I'm not\nupset, why should you be?  And how could I blame you two for\ngetting crazy about each other?  I wouldn't spoil it for\nworlds.  I want to help it on.\"\n\n\"Don't you love him--really?\" cried Constance, face and voice\nfull of the most thrilling theatricalism.\n\n\"I'm very fond of him,\" replied Susan.  \"We're old, old\nfriends.  But as to love--I'm where you'll be a few months\nfrom now.\"\n\nMiss Francklyn dried her eyes.  \"Isn't it the devil!\" she\nexclaimed.  \"Why _can't_ it last?\"\n\n\"Why, indeed,\" said Susan.  \"Good night--and don't forget to\nsend him by twelve o'clock.\"  And she hurried up the steps\nwithout waiting for a reply.\n\nShe felt that the time for action had again come--that critical\nmoment which she had so often in the past seen come and had\nlet pass unheeded.  He was in love with another woman; he was\nprosperous, assured of a good income for a long time, though\nhe wrote no more successes.  No need to consider him.  For\nherself, then--what?  Clearly, there could be no future for\nher with Rod.  Clearly, she must go.\n\nMust go--must take the only road that offered.  Up before\nher--as in every mood of deep depression--rose the vision of\nthe old women of the slums--the solitary, bent, broken forms,\nclad in rags, feet wrapped in rags--shuffling along in the\ngutters, peering and poking among filth, among garbage, to get\ntogether stuff to sell for the price of a drink.  The old\nwomen of the tenements, the old women of the gutters, the old\nwomen drunk and dancing as the lecherous-eyed hunchback played\nthe piano.\n\nShe must not this time wait and hesitate and hope; this time\nshe must take the road that offered--and since it must be\ntaken she must advance along it as if of all possible roads it\nwas the only one she would have freely chosen.\n\nYet after she had written and sent off the note to Palmer, a\ndeep sadness enveloped her--a grief, not for Rod, but for the\nassociation, the intimacy, their life together, its sorrows\nand storms perhaps more than the pleasures and the joys.  When\nshe left him before, she had gone sustained by the feeling\nthat she was doing it for him, was doing a duty.  Now, she was\ngoing merely to save herself, to further herself.  Life, life\nin that great and hard school of practical living, New York,\nhad given her the necessary hardiness to go, aided by Rod's\nunfaithfulness and growing uncongeniality.  But not while she\nlived could she ever learn to be hard.  She would do what she\nmust--she was no longer a fool.  But she could not help\nsighing and crying a little as she did it.\n\nIt was not many minutes after noon when Spenser came.  He\nlooked so sheepish and uncomfortable that Susan thought\nConstance had told him.  But his opening sentence of apology was:\n\n\"I took too many nightcaps and Fitz had to lug me home with him.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Susan.  \"How disappointed Constance must have been!\"\n\nSpenser was not a good liar.  His face twisted and twitched so\nthat Susan laughed outright.  \"Why, you look like a caught\nmarried man,\" cried she.  \"You forget we're both free.\"\n\n\"Whatever put that crazy notion in your head--about Miss\nFrancklyn?\" demanded he.\n\n\"When you take me or anyone for that big a fool, Rod, you only\nshow how foolish you yourself are,\" said she with the utmost\ngood humor.  \"The best way to find out how much sense a person has\nis to see what kind of lies he thinks'll deceive another person.\"\n\n\"Now--don't get jealous, Susie,\" soothed he.  \"You know how a\nman is.\"\n\nThe tone was correctly contrite, but Susan felt underneath the\nconfidence that he would be forgiven--the confidence of the\negotist giddied by a triumph.  Said she:\n\n\"Don't you think mine's a strange way of acting jealous?\"\n\n\"But you're a strange woman.\"\n\nSusan looked at him thoughtfully.  \"Yes, I suppose I am,\" said\nshe.  \"And you'll think me stranger when I tell you what I'm\ngoing to do.\"\n\nHe started up in a panic.  And the fear in his eyes pleased\nher, at the same time that it made her wince.\n\nShe nodded slowly.  \"Yes, Rod--I'm leaving.\"\n\n\"I'll drop Constance,\" cried he.  \"I'll have her put out of\nthe company.\"\n\n\"No--go on with her till you've got enough--or she has.\"\n\n\"I've got enough, this minute,\" declared he with convincing\nenergy and passion.  \"You must know, dearest, that to me\nConstance--all the women I've ever seen--aren't worth your\nlittle finger.  You're all that they are, and a whole lot more\nbesides.\"  He seized her in his arms.  \"You wouldn't leave\nme--you couldn't!  You understand how men are--how they get\nthese fits of craziness about a pair of eyes or a figure or\nsome trick of voice or manner.  But that doesn't affect the\nman's heart.  I love you, Susan.  I adore you.\"\n\nShe did not let him see how sincerely he had touched her.  Her\neyes were of their deepest violet, but he had never learned\nthat sign.  She smiled mockingly; the fingers that caressed\nhis hair were trembling.  \"We've tided each other over, Rod.\nThe play's a success.  You're all right again--and so am I.\nNow's the time to part.\"\n\n\"Is it Brent, Susie?\"\n\n\"I quit him last week.\"\n\n\"There's no one else.  You're going because of Constance!\"\n\nShe did not deny.  \"You're free and so am I,\" said she\npractically.  \"I'm going.  So--let's part sensibly.  Don't\nmake a silly scene.\"\n\nShe knew how to deal with him--how to control him through his\nvanity.  He drew away from her, chilled and sullen.  \"If you\ncan live through it, I guess I can,\" said he.  \"You're making\na damn fool of yourself--leaving a man that's fond of you--and\nleaving when he's successful.\"\n\n\"I always was a fool, you know,\" said she.  She had decided\nagainst explaining to him and so opening up endless and vain\nargument.  It was enough that she saw it was impossible to\nbuild upon or with him, saw the necessity of trying\nelsewhere--unless she would risk--no, invite--finding herself\nafter a few months, or years, back among the drift, back in\nthe underworld.\n\nHe gazed at her as she stood smiling gently at him--smiling to\nhelp her hide the ache at her heart, the terror before the\nvision of the old women of the tenement gutters, earning the\nwages, not of sin, not of vice, not of stupidity, but of\nindecision, of over-hopefulness--of weakness.  Here was the\nkind of smile that hurts worse than tears, that takes the\nplace of tears and sobs and moans.  But he who had never\nunderstood her did not understand her now.  Her smile\ninfuriated his vanity.  \"You can _laugh!_\" he sneered.\n\"Well--go to the filth where you belong!  You were born for\nit.\"  And he flung out of the room, went noisily down the\nstairs.  She heard the front door's distant slam; it seemed to\ndrop her into a chair.  She sat there all crouched together\nuntil the clock on the mantel struck two.  This roused her\nhastily to gather into her trunk such of her belongings as she\nhad not already packed.  She sent for a cab.  The man of all\nwork carried down the trunk and put it on the box.  Dressed in\na simple blue costume as if for traveling, she entered the cab\nand gave the order to drive to the Grand Central Station.\n\nAt the corner she changed the order and was presently entering\nthe Beaux Arts restaurant where she had asked Freddie to meet\nher.  He was there, smoking calmly and waiting.  At sight of\nher he rose.  \"You'll have lunch?\" said he.\n\n\"No, thanks.\"\n\n\"A small bottle of champagne?\"\n\n\"Yes--I'm rather tired.\"\n\nHe ordered the champagne.  \"And,\" said he, \"it'll be the real\nthing--which mighty few New Yorkers get even at the best\nplaces.\"  When it came he sent the waiter away and filled the\nglasses himself.  He touched the brim of his glass to the\nbottom of hers.  \"To the new deal,\" said he.\n\nShe smiled and nodded, and emptied the glass.  Suddenly it\ncame to her why she felt so differently toward him.  She saw\nthe subtle, yet radical change that always transforms a man of\nforce of character when his position in the world notably\nchanges.  This man before her, so slightly different in\nphysical characteristics from the man she had fled, was wholly\ndifferent in expression.\n\n\"When shall we sail?\" asked he.  \"Tomorrow?\"\n\n\"First--there's the question of money,\" said she.\n\nHe was much amused.  \"Still worrying about your independence.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied she.  \"I've been thinking it out, and I don't\nfeel any anxiety about that.  I've changed my scheme of life.\nI'm going to be sensible and practice what life has taught me.\nIt seems there's only one way for a woman to get up.  Through\nsome man.\"\n\nFreddie nodded.  \"By marriage or otherwise, but always through\na man.\"\n\n\"So I've discovered,\" continued she.  \"So, I'm going to play\nthe game.  And I think I can win now.  With the aid of what\nI'll learn and with the chances I'll have, I can keep my\nfeeling of independence.  You see, if you and I don't get on\nwell together, I'll be able to look out for myself.\nSomething'll turn up.\"\n\n\"Or--_somebody_--eh?\"\n\n\"Or somebody.\"\n\n\"That's candid.\"\n\n\"Don't you want me to be candid?  But even if you don't, I've\ngot to be.\"\n\n\"Yes--truth--especially disagreeable truth--is your long\nsuit,\" said he.  \"Not that I'm kicking.  I'm glad you went\nstraight at the money question.  We can settle it and never\nthink of it again.  And neither of us will be plotting to take\nadvantage of the other, or fretting for fear the other is\nplotting.  Sometimes I think nearly all the trouble in this\nworld comes through failure to have a clear understanding\nabout money matters.\"\n\nSusan nodded.  Said she thoughtfully, \"I guess that's why I\ncame--one of the main reasons.  You are wonderfully sensible\nand decent about money.\"\n\n\"And the other chap isn't?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--and no.  He likes to make a woman feel dependent.\nHe thinks--but that doesn't matter.  He's all right.\"\n\n\"Now--for our understanding with each other,\" said Palmer.\n\"You can have whatever you want.  The other day you said you\nwanted some sort of a salary.  But if you've changed----\"\n\n\"No--that's what I want.\"\n\n\"So much a year?\"\n\n\"So much a week,\" replied she.  \"I want to feel, and I want\nyou to feel, that we can call it off at any time on seven\ndays' notice.\"\n\n\"But that isn't what I want,\" said he--and she, watching him\nclosely if furtively, saw the strong lines deepen round his mouth.\n\nShe hesitated.  She was seeing the old woman's dance hall, was\nhearing the piano as the hunchback played and the old horrors\nreeled about, making their palsy rhythmic.  She was seeing\nthis, yet she dared.  \"Then you don't want me,\" said she, so\nquietly that he could not have suspected her agitation.  Never\nhad her habit of concealing her emotion been so useful to her.\n\nHe sat frowning at his glass--debating.  Finally he said:\n\n\"I explained the other day what I was aiming for.  Such an\narrangement as you suggest wouldn't help.  You see that?\"\n\n\"It's all I can do--at present,\" replied she firmly.  And she\nwas now ready to stand or fall by that decision.  She had\nalways accepted the other previous terms--or whatever terms\nfate offered.  Result--each time, disaster.  She must make no\nmore fatal blunders.  This time, her own terms or not at all.\n\nHe was silent a long time.  She knew she had convinced him\nthat her terms were final.  So, his delay could only mean that\nhe was debating whether to accept or to go his way and leave\nher to go hers.  At last he laughed and said:\n\n\"You've become a true New Yorker.  You know how to drive a\nhard bargain.\"  He looked at her admiringly.  \"You certainly\nhave got courage.  I happen to know a lot about your affairs.\nI've ways of finding out things.  And I know you'd not be here\nif you hadn't broken with the other fellow first.  So, if I\nturned your proposition down you'd be up against it--wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she.  \"But--I won't in any circumstances tie\nmyself.  I must be free.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" said he.  \"And I'll risk your sticking.  I'm\na good gambler.\"\n\n\"If I were bound, but didn't want to stay, would I be of much use?\"\n\n\"Of no use.  You can quit on seven minutes' notice, instead of\nseven days.\"\n\n\"And you, also,\" said she.\n\nLaughingly they shook hands.  She began to like him in a new\nand more promising way.  Here was a man, who at least was cast\nin a big mold.  Nothing small and cheap about him--and Brent\nhad made small cheap men forever intolerable to her.  Yes,\nhere was a man of the big sort; and a big man couldn't\npossibly be a bad man.  No matter how many bad things he might\ndo, he would still be himself, at least, a scorner of the\npettiness and sneakiness and cowardice inseparable from villainy.\n\n\"And now,\" said he, \"let's settle the last detail.  How much\na week?  How would five hundred strike you?\"\n\n\"That's more than twelve times the largest salary I ever got.\nIt's many times as much as I made in the----\"\n\n\"No matter,\" he hastily interposed.  \"It's the least you can\nhold down the job on.  You've got to spend money--for clothes\nand so on.\"\n\n\"Two hundred is the most I can take,\" said she.  \"It's the\noutside limit.\"\n\nHe insisted, but she remained firm.  \"I will not accustom\nmyself to much more than I see any prospect of getting\nelsewhere,\" explained she.  \"Perhaps later on I'll ask for an\nincrease--later on, when I see how things are going and what\nmy prospects elsewhere would be.  But I must begin modestly.\"\n\n\"Well, let it go at two hundred for the present.  I'll deposit\na year's salary in a bank, and you can draw against it.  Is\nthat satisfactory?  You don't want me to hand you two hundred\ndollars every Saturday, do you?\"\n\n\"No.  That would get on my nerves,\" said she.\n\n\"Now--it's all settled.  When shall we sail?\"\n\n\"There's a girl I've got to look up before I go.\"\n\n\"Maud?  You needn't bother about her.  She's married to a\npiker from up the state--a shoe manufacturer.  She's got\na baby, and is fat enough to make two or three like what\nshe used to be.\"\n\n\"No, not Maud.  One you don't know.\"\n\n\"I hoped we could sail tomorrow.  Why not take a taxi and go\nafter her now?\"\n\n\"It may be a long search.\"\n\n\"She's a----?\" He did not need to finish his sentence in order\nto make himself understood.\n\nSusan nodded.\n\n\"Oh, let her----\"\n\n\"I promised,\" interrupted she.\n\n\"Then--of course.\"  Freddie drew from his trousers pocket a\nhuge roll of bills.  Susan smiled at this proof that he still\nretained the universal habit of gamblers, politicians and\nsimilar loose characters of large income, precariously\nderived.  He counted off three hundreds and four fifties and\nheld them out to her.  \"Let me in on it,\" said he.\n\nSusan took the money without hesitation.  She was used to\nthese careless generosities of the men of that\nclass--generosities passing with them and with the unthinking\nfor evidences of goodness of heart, when in fact no generosity\nhas any significance whatever beyond selfish vanity unless it\nis a sacrifice of necessities--real necessities.\n\n\"I don't think I'll need money,\" said she.  \"But I may.\"\n\n\"You've got a trunk and a bag on the cab outside,\" he went on.\n\"I've told them at Sherry's that I'm to be married.\"\n\nSusan flushed.  She hastily lowered her eyes.  But she need\nnot have feared lest he should suspect the cause of the\nblush . . . a strange, absurd resentment of the idea that she\ncould be married to Freddie Palmer.  Live with him--yes.  But\nmarry--now that it was thus squarely presented to her, she\nfound it unthinkable.  She did not pause to analyze this\nfeeling, indeed could not have analyzed it, had she tried.  It\nwas, however, a most interesting illustration of how she had\nbeen educated at last to look upon questions of sex as a man\nlooks on them.  She was like the man who openly takes a\nmistress whom he in no circumstances would elevate to the\nposition of wife.\n\n\"So,\" he proceeded, \"you might as well move in at Sherry's.\"\n\n\"No,\" objected she.  \"Let's not begin the new deal until we sail.\"\n\nThe wisdom of this was obvious.  \"Then we'll take your things\nover to the Manhattan Hotel,\" said he.  \"And we'll start the\nsearch from there.\"\n\nBut after registering at the Manhattan as Susan Lenox, she\nstarted out alone.  She would not let him look in upon any\npart of her life which she could keep veiled.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nSHE left the taxicab at the corner of Grand Street and the\nBowery, and plunged into her former haunts afoot.  Once again\nshe had it forced upon her how meaningless in the life history\nare the words \"time\" and \"space.\"  She was now hardly any\ndistance, as measurements go, from her present world, and she\nhad lived here only a yesterday or so ago.  Yet what an\ninfinity yawned between!  At the Delancey Street apartment\nhouse there was already a new janitress, and the kinds of\nshops on the ground floor had changed.  Only after two hours\nof going up and down stairs, of knocking at doors, of\nquestioning and cross-questioning, did she discover that Clara\nhad moved to Allen Street, to the tenement in which Susan\nherself had for a few weeks lived--those vague, besotted weeks\nof despair.\n\nWhen we go out into the streets with bereavement in mind, we\nsee nothing but people dressed in mourning.  And a similar\nthing occurs, whatever the emotion that oppresses us.  It\nwould not have been strange if Susan, on the way to Allen\nStreet afoot, had seen only women of the streets, for they\nswarm in every great thoroughfare of our industrial cities.\nThey used to come out only at night.  But with the passing of\nthe feeling against them that existed when they were a rare,\nunfamiliar, mysteriously terrible minor feature of life, they\nissue forth boldly by day, like all the other classes, making\na living as best they can.  But on that day Susan felt as if\nshe were seeing only the broken down and cast-out creatures of\nthe class--the old women, old in body rather than in years,\npicking in the gutters, fumbling in the garbage barrels,\npoking and peering everywhere for odds and ends that might\npile up into the price of a glass of the poison sold in the\nbarrel houses.  The old women--the hideous, lonely old\nwomen--and the diseased, crippled children, worse off than the\ncats and the dogs, for cat and dog were not compelled to wear\nfilth-soaked rags.  Prosperous, civilized New York!\n\nA group of these children were playing some rough game, in\nimitation of their elders, that was causing several to howl\nwith pain.  She heard a woman, being shown about by a\nsettlement worker or some such person, say:\n\n\"Really, not at all badly dressed--for street games.  I must\nconfess I don't see signs of the misery they talk so much about.\"\n\nA wave of fury passed through Susan.  She felt like striking\nthe woman full in her vain, supercilious, patronizing\nface--striking her and saying:  \"You smug liar!  What if you\nhad to wear such clothes on that fat, overfed body of yours!\nYou'd realize then how filthy they are!\"\n\nShe gazed in horror at the Allen Street house.  Was it\npossible that _she_ had lived there?  In the filthy doorway sat\na child eating a dill pickle--a scrawny, ragged little girl\nwith much of her hair eaten out by the mange.  She recalled\nthis little girl as the formerly pretty and lively youngster,\nthe daughter of the janitress.  She went past the child\nwithout disturbing her, knocked at the janitress' door.  It\npresently opened, disclosing in a small and foul room four\nprematurely old women, all in the family way, two with babies\nin arms.  One of these was the janitress.  Though she was not\na Jewess, she was wearing one of the wigs assumed by orthodox\nJewish women when they marry.  She stared at Susan with not a\nsign of recognition.\n\n\"I am looking for Miss Clara,\" said Susan.\n\nThe janitress debated, shifted her baby from one arm to the\nother, glanced inquiringly at the other women.  They shook\ntheir heads; she looked at Susan and shook her head.  \"There\nain't a Clara,\" said she.  \"Perhaps she's took another name?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" conceded Susan.  And she described Clara and the\nvarious dresses she had had.  At the account of one with\nflounces on the skirts and lace puffs in the sleeves, the\nyoungest of the women showed a gleam of intelligence.  \"You\nmean the girl with the cancer of the breast,\" said she.\n\nSusan remembered.  She could not articulate; she nodded.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said the janitress.  \"She had the third floor back,\nand was always kicking because Mrs. Pfister kept a guinea pig\nfor her rheumatism and the smell came through.\"\n\n\"Has she gone?\" asked Susan.\n\n\"Couple of weeks.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\nThe janitress shrugged her shoulders.  The other women\nshrugged their shoulders.  Said the janitress:\n\n\"Her feller stopped coming.  The cancer got awful bad.  I've\nsaw a good many--they're quite plentiful down this way.  I\nnever see a worse'n hers.  She didn't have no money.  Up to\nthe hospital they tried a new cure on her that made her\ngallopin' worse.  The day before I was going to have to go to\nwork and put her out--she left.\"\n\n\"Can't you give me any idea?\" urged Susan.\n\n\"She didn't take her things,\" said the janitress meaningly.\n\"Not a stitch.\"\n\n\"The--the river?\"\n\nThe janitress shrugged her shoulders.  \"She always said she\nwould, and I guess----\"\n\nAgain the fat, stooped shoulders lifted and lowered.  \"She was\nmost crazy with pain.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence, then Susan murmured, \"Thank\nyou,\" and went back to the hall.  The house was exhaling a\nfrightful stench--the odor of cheap kerosene, of things that\npassed there for food, of animals human and lower, of death\nand decay.  On her way out she dropped a dollar into the lap\nof the little girl with the mange.  A parrot was shrieking\nfrom an upper window.  On the topmost fire escape was a row of\ngeraniums blooming sturdily.  Her taxicab had moved up the\nstreet, pushed out of place by a hearse--a white hearse, with\npolished mountings, the horses caparisoned in white netting,\nand tossing white plumes.  A baby's funeral--this mockery of\na ride in state after a brief life of squalor.  It was summer,\nand the babies were dying like lambs in the shambles.  In\nwinter the grown people were slaughtered; in summer the\nchildren.  Across the street, a few doors up, the city dead\nwagon was taking away another body--in a plain pine box--to\nthe Potter's Field where find their way for the final rest one\nin every ten of the people of the rich and splendid city of\nNew York.\n\nSusan hurried into her cab.  \"Drive fast,\" she said.\n\nWhen she came back to sense of her surroundings she was flying\nup wide and airy Fifth Avenue with gorgeous sunshine bathing\nits palaces, with wealth and fashion and ease all about her.\nHer dear City of the Sun!  But it hurt her now, was hateful to\nlook upon.  She closed her eyes; her life in the slums, her\nlife when she was sharing the lot that is really the lot of\nthe human race as a race, passed before her--its sights and\nsounds and odors, its hideous heat, its still more hideous\ncold, its contacts and associations, its dirt and disease and\ndegradation.  And through the roar of the city there came to\nher a sound, faint yet intense--like the still, small voice\nthe prophet heard--but not the voice of God, rather the voice\nof the multitude of aching hearts, aching in hopeless\npoverty--hearts of men, of women, of children----\n\nThe children!  The multitudes of children with hearts that no\nsooner begin to beat than they begin to ache.  She opened her\neyes to shut out these sights and that sound of heartache.\n\nShe gazed round, drew a long breath of relief.  She had almost\nbeen afraid to look round lest she should find that her escape\nhad been only a dream.  And now the road she had chosen--or,\nrather, the only road she could take--the road with Freddie\nPalmer--seemed attractive, even dazzling.  What she could not\nlike, she would ignore--and how easily she, after her\nexperience, could do that!  What she could not ignore she\nwould tolerate would compel herself to like.\n\nPoor Clara!--Happy Clara!--better off in the dregs of the\nriver than she had ever been in the dregs of New York.  She\nshuddered.  Then, as so often, the sense of the grotesque\nthrust in, as out of place as jester in cap and bells at a\nbier--and she smiled sardonically.  \"Why,\" thought she,\n\"in being squeamish about Freddie I'm showing that I'm more\nrespectable than the respectable women.  There's hardly one\nof them that doesn't swallow worse doses with less excuse or\nno excuse at all--and without so much as a wry face.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nIN the ten days on the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Mr. and\nMrs. Palmer, as the passenger list declared them, planned the\nearly stages of their campaign.  They must keep to themselves,\nmust make no acquaintances, no social entanglements of any\nkind, until they had effected the exterior transformation\nwhich was to be the first stride--and a very long one, they\nfelt--toward the conquest of the world that commands all the\nother worlds.  Several men aboard knew Palmer slightly--knew\nhim vaguely as a big politician and contractor.  They had a\nhazy notion that he was reputed to have been a thug and a\ngrafter.  But New Yorkers have few prejudices except against\nguilelessness and failure.  They are well aware that the\nwisest of the wise Hebrew race was never more sagacious than\nwhen he observed that \"he who hasteth to be rich shall not be\ninnocent.\"  They are too well used to unsavory pasts to bother\nmuch about that kind of odor; and where in the civilized\nworld--or in that which is not civilized--is there an odor\nfrom reputation--or character--whose edge is not taken off by\nthe strong, sweet, hypnotic perfume of money?  Also, Palmer's\nappearance gave the lie direct to any scandal about him.  It\ncould not be--it simply could not be--that a man of such\nsplendid physical build, a man with a countenance so handsome,\nhad ever been a low, wicked fellow!  Does not the devil always\nat once exhibit his hoofs, horns, tail and malevolent smile,\nthat all men may know who and what he is?  A frank, manly\nyoung leader of men--that was the writing on his countenance.\nAnd his Italian blood put into his good looks an ancient and\naristocratic delicacy that made it incredible that he was of\nlow origin.  He spoke good English, he dressed quietly; he\ndid not eat with his knife; he did not retire behind a napkin\nto pick his teeth, but attended to them openly, if necessity\ncompelled--and splendid teeth they were, set in a wide, clean\nmouth, notably attractive for a man's.  No, Freddie Palmer's\npast would not give him any trouble whatever; in a few years\nit would be forgotten, would be romanced about as the heroic\nstruggles of a typical American rising from poverty.\n\n\"Thank God,\" said Freddie, \"I had sense enough not to get a\njail smell on me!\"\n\nSusan colored painfully--and Palmer, the sensitive, colored\nalso.  But he had the tact that does not try to repair a\nblunder by making a worse one; he pretended not to see Susan's\ncrimson flush.\n\n_Her_ past would not be an easy matter--if it should ever rise\nto face her publicly.  Therefore it must not rise till Freddie\nand she were within the walls of the world they purposed to\nenter by stealth, and had got themselves well intrenched.\nThen she would be Susan Lenox of Sutherland, Indiana, who had\ncome to New York to study for the stage and, after many trials\nfrom all of which she had emerged with unspotted virtue,\nwhatever vicious calumny might in envy say, had captured the\nheart and the name of the handsome, rich young contractor.\nThere would be nasty rumors, dreadful stories, perhaps.  But\nin these loose and cynical days, with the women more and more\naudacious and independent, with the universal craving for\nluxury beyond the reach of laboriously earned incomes, with\nmarriage decaying in city life among the better classes--in\nthese easy-going days, who was not suspected, hinted about,\nattacked?  And the very atrociousness of the stories would\nprevent their being believed.  One glance at Susan would be\nenough to make doubters laugh at their doubts.\n\nThe familiar types of fast women of all degrees come from the\npoorest kinds of farms and from the tenements.  In America,\npractically not until the panics and collapses of recent years\nwhich have tumbled another and better section of the middle\nclass into the abyss of the underworld--not until then did\nthere appear in the city streets and houses of ill repute any\nconsiderable number of girls from good early surroundings.\nBefore that time, the clamor for luxury--the luxury that\ncivilization makes as much a necessity as food--had been\nsatisfied more or less by the incomes of the middle class; and\nany girl of that class, with physical charm and shrewdness\nenough to gain a living as outcast woman, was either supported\nat home or got a husband able to give her at least enough of\nwhat her tastes craved to keep her in the ranks of the\nreputable.  Thus Susan's beauty of refinement, her speech and\nmanner of the lady, made absurd any suggestion that she could\never have been a fallen woman.  The crimson splash of her\nrouged lips did not suggest the _cocotte_, but the lady with a\ndash of gayety in her temperament.  This, because of the\nsweet, sensitive seriousness of her small, pallid face with\nits earnest violet-gray eyes and its frame of abundant dark\nhair, simply and gracefully arranged.  She was of the advance\nguard of a type which the swift downfall of the middle class,\nthe increasing intelligence and restlessness and love of\nluxury among women, and the decay of formal religion with its\nexactions of chastity as woman's one diamond-fine jewel, are\nnow making familiar in every city.  The demand for the\nluxurious comfort which the educated regard as merely decent\nexistence is far outstripping the demand for, and the\neducation of, women in lucrative occupations other than\nprostitution.\n\nLuckily Susan had not been arrested under her own name; there\nexisted no court record which could be brought forward as\nproof by some nosing newspaper.\n\nSusan herself marveled that there was not more trace of her\nunderworld experience in her face and in her mind.  She could\nnot account for it.  Yet the matter was simple enough to one\nviewing it from the outside.  It is what we think, what we\nfeel about ourselves, that makes up our expression of body and\nsoul.  And never in her lowest hour had her soul struck its\nflag and surrendered to the idea that she was a fallen\ncreature.  She had a temperament that estimated her acts not\nas right and wrong but as necessity.  Men, all the rest of the\nworld, might regard her as nothing but sex symbol; she\nregarded herself as an intelligence.  And the filth slipped\nfrom her and could not soak in to change the texture of her\nbeing.  She had no more the feeling or air of the _cocotte_\nthan has the married woman who lives with her husband for a\nliving.  Her expression, her way of looking at her fellow\nbeings and of meeting their looks, was that of the woman of\nthe world who is for whatever reason above that slavery to\nopinion, that fear of being thought bold or forward which\ncauses women of the usual run to be sensitive about staring or\nbeing stared at.  Sometimes--in _cocottes_, in stage women, in\nfashionable women--this expression is self-conscious, or\nsupercilious.  It was not so with Susan, for she had little\nself-consciousness and no snobbishness at all.  It merely gave\nthe charm of worldly experience and expertness to a beauty\nwhich, without it, might have been too melancholy.\n\nSusan, become by sheer compulsion philosopher about the\nvagaries of fat, did not fret over possible future dangers.\nShe dismissed them and put all her intelligence and energy to\nthe business in hand--to learning and to helping Palmer learn\nthe ways of that world which includes all worlds.\n\nToward the end of the voyage she said to him:\n\n\"About my salary--or allowance--or whatever it is----  I've\nbeen thinking things over.  I've made up my mind to save some\nmoney.  My only chance is that salary.  Have you any objection\nto my saving it--as much of it as I can?\"\n\nHe laughed.  \"Tuck away anything and everything you can lay\nyour hands on,\" said he.  \"I'm not one of those fools who\ntry to hold women by being close and small with them.\nI'd not want you about if you were of the sort that\ncould be held that way.\"\n\n\"No--I'll put by only from my salary,\" said she.  \"I admit\nI've no right to do that.  But I've become sensible enough to\nrealize that I mustn't ever risk being out again with no\nmoney.  It has got on my mind so that I'd not be able to think\nof much else for worrying--unless I had at least a little.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to make you independent?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied she.  \"Whatever you gave me I'd have to give\nback if we separated.\"\n\n\"_That_ isn't the way to get on, my dear,\" said he.\n\n\"It's the best I can do--as yet,\" replied she.  \"And it's\nquite an advance on what I was.  Yes, I _am_ learning--slowly.\"\n\n\"Save all your salary, then,\" said Freddie.  \"When you buy\nanything charge it, and I'll attend to the bill.\"\n\nHer expression told him that he had never made a shrewder\nmove in his life.  He knew he had made himself secure against\nlosing her; for he knew what a force gratitude was in her\ncharacter.\n\nHer mind was now free--free for the educational business in\nhand.  She appreciated that he had less to learn than she.\nCivilization, the science and art of living, of extracting all\npossible good from the few swift years of life, has\nbeen--since the downfall of woman from hardship, ten or\nfifteen thousand years ago--the creation of the man almost\nentirely.  Until recently among the higher races such small\ndevelopment of the intelligence of woman as her seclusion and\nservitude permitted was sporadic and exotic.  Nothing\nintelligent was expected of her--and it is only under the\ncompulsion of peremptory demand that any human being ever is\nroused from the natural sluggishness.  But civilization,\ncreated _by_ man, was created _for_ woman.  Woman has to learn\nhow to be the civilized being which man has ordained that she\nshall be--how to use for man's comfort and pleasure the\ningenuities and the graces he has invented.\n\nIt is easy for a man to pick up the habits, tastes, manners\nand dress of male citizens of the world, if he has as keen\neyes and as discriminating taste as had Palmer, clever\ndescendant of the supple Italian.  But to become a female\ncitizen of the world is not so easy.  For Susan to learn to be\nan example of the highest civilization, from her inmost\nthoughts to the outermost penumbra of her surroundings--that\nwould be for her a labor of love, but still a labor.  As her\nvanity was of the kind that centers on the advantages she\nactually had, instead of being the more familiar kind that\ncenters upon non-existent charms of mind and person, her task\nwas possible of accomplishment--for those who are sincerely\nwilling to learn, who sincerely know wherein they lack, can\nlearn, can be taught.  As she had given these matters of\ncivilization intelligent thought she knew where to begin--at\nthe humble, material foundation, despised and neglected by\nthose who talk most loudly about civilization, art, culture,\nand so on.  They aspire to the clouds and the stars at\nonce--and arrive nowhere except in talk and pretense and\nflaunting of ill-fitting borrowed plumage.  They flap their\ngaudy artificial wings; there is motion, but no ascent.  Susan\nwished to build--and build solidly.  She began with the\nso-called trifles.\n\nWhen they had been at Naples a week Palmer said:\n\n\"Don't you think we'd better push on to Paris?\"\n\n\"I can't go before Saturday,\" replied she.  \"I've got several\nfittings yet.\"\n\n\"It's pretty dull here for me--with you spending so much time\nin the shops.  I suppose the women's shops are\ngood\"--hesitatingly--\"but I've heard those in Paris are better.\"\n\n\"The shops here are rotten.  Italian women have no taste in\ndress.  And the Paris shops are the best in the world.\"\n\n\"Then let's clear out,\" cried he.  \"I'm bored to death.  But\nI didn't like to say anything, you seemed so busy.\"\n\n\"I am busy.  And--can you stand it three days more?\"\n\n\"But you'll only have to throw away the stuff you buy here.\nWhy buy so much?\"\n\n\"I'm not buying much.  Two ready-to-wear Paris dresses--models\nthey call them--and two hats.\"\n\nPalmer looked alarmed.  \"Why, at that rate,\" protested he,\n\"it'll take you all winter to get together your winter\nclothes, and no time left to wear 'em.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" said she.  \"If you want to be treated\nright in a shop--be shown the best things--have your orders\nattended to, you've got to come looking as if you knew what\nthe best is.  I'm getting ready to make a good first\nimpression on the dressmakers and milliners in Paris.\"\n\n\"Oh, you'll have the money, and that'll make 'em step round.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe it,\" replied she.  \"All the money in the\nworld won't get you _fashionable_ clothes at the most\nfashionable place.  It'll only get you _costly_ clothes.\"\n\n\"Maybe that's so for women's things.  It isn't for men's.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure of that.  When we get to Paris, we'll see.  But\ncertainly it's true for women.  If I went to the places in the\nrue de la Paix dressed as I am now, it'd take several years to\nconvince them that I knew what I wanted and wouldn't be\nsatisfied with anything but the latest and best.  So I'm\nhaving these miserable dressmakers fit those dresses on me\nuntil they're absolutely perfect.  It's wearing me out, but\nI'll be glad I did it.\"\n\nPalmer had profound respect for her as a woman who knew what\nshe was about.  So he settled himself patiently and passed\nthe time investigating the famous Neapolitan political machine\nwith the aid of an interpreter guide whom he hired by the day.\nHe was enthusiastic over the dresses and the hats when Susan\nat last had them at the hotel and showed herself to him in\nthem.  They certainly did work an amazing change in her.  They\nwere the first real Paris models she had ever worn.\n\n\"Maybe it's because I never thought much about women's clothes\nbefore,\" said Freddie, \"but those things seem to be the best\never.  How they do show up your complexion and your figure!\nAnd I hadn't any idea your hair was as grand as all that.  I'm\na little afraid of you.  We've got to get acquainted all over\nagain.  These clothes of mine look pretty poor, don't they?\nYet I paid all kinds of money for 'em at the best place in\nFifth Avenue.\"\n\nHe examined her from all points of view, going round and round\nher, getting her to walk up and down to give him the full\neffect of her slender yet voluptuous figure in that\nbeautifully fitted coat and skirt.  He felt that his dreams\nwere beginning to come true.\n\n\"We'll do the trick!\" cried he.  \"Don't you think about money\nwhen you're buying clothes.  It's a joy to give up for clothes\nfor you.  You make 'em look like something.\"\n\n\"Wait till I've shopped a few weeks in Paris,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Let's start tonight,\" cried he.  \"I'll telegraph to the Ritz\nfor rooms.\"\n\nWhen she began to dress in her old clothes for the journey, he\nprotested.  \"Throw all these things away,\" he urged.  \"Wear\none of the new dresses and hats.\"\n\n\"But they're not exactly suitable for traveling.\"\n\n\"People'll think you lost your baggage.  I don't want ever to\nsee you again looking any way except as you ought to look.\"\n\n\"No, I must take care of those clothes,\" said she firmly.\n\"It'll be weeks before I can get anything in Paris, and I must\nkeep up a good front.\"\n\nHe continued to argue with her until it occurred to him that\nas his own clothes were not what they should be, he and she\nwould look much better matched if she dressed as she wished.\nHe had not been so much in jest as he thought when he said to\nher that they would have to get acquainted all over again.\nThose new clothes of hers brought out startlingly--so clearly\nthat even his vanity was made uneasy--the subtle yet profound\ndifference of class between them.  He had always felt this\ndifference, and in the old days it had given him many a savage\nimpulse to degrade her, to put her beneath him as a punishment\nfor his feeling that she was above him.  Now he had his\nambition too close at heart to wish to rob her of her chief\ndistinction; he was disturbed about it, though, and looked\nforward to Paris with uneasiness.\n\n\"You must help me get my things,\" said he.\n\n\"I'd be glad to,\" said she.  \"And you must be frank with me,\nand tell me where I fall short of the best of the women we see.\"\n\nHe laughed.  The idea that he could help her seemed fantastic.\nHe could not understand it--how this girl who had been brought\nup in a jay town away out West, who had never had what might\nbe called a real chance to get in the know in New York, could\nso quickly pass him who had been born and bred in New York,\nhad spent the last ten years in cultivating style and all the\nother luxurious tastes.  He did not like to linger on this\npuzzle; the more he worked at it, the farther away from him\nSusan seemed to get.  Yet the puzzle would not let him drop it.\n\nThey came in at the Gare de Lyon in the middle of a beautiful\nOctober afternoon.  Usually, from late September or earlier\nuntil May or later, Paris has about the vilest climate that\ncurses a civilized city.  It is one of the bitterest ironies\nof fate that a people so passionately fond of the sun, of the\noutdoors, should be doomed for two-thirds of the year to live\nunder leaden, icily leaking skies with rarely a ray of real\nsunshine.  And nothing so well illustrates the exuberant\nvitality, the dauntless spirit of the French people, as the\nway they have built in preparation for the enjoyment of every\nbit of the light and warmth of any chance ray of sunshine.\nThat year it so fell that the winter rains did not close in\nuntil late, and Paris reveled in a long autumn of almost New\nYork perfection.  Susan and Palmer drove to the Ritz through\nParis, the lovely, the gay.\n\n\"This is the real thing--isn't it?\" said he, thrilled into\nspeech by that spectacle so inspiring to all who have the joy\nof life in their veins--the Place de l'Opéra late on a bright\nafternoon.\n\n\"It's the first thing I've ever seen that was equal to what I\nhad dreamed about it,\" replied she.\n\nThey had chosen the Ritz as their campaign headquarters\nbecause they had learned that it was the most fashionable\nhotel in Paris--which meant in the world.  There were hotels\nmore grand, the interpreter-guide at Naples had said; there\nwere hotels more exclusive.  There were even hotels more\ncomfortable.  \"But for fashion,\" said he, \"it is the summit.\nThere you see the most beautiful ladies, most beautifully\ndressed.  There you see the elegant world at tea and at dinner.\"\n\nAt first glance they were somewhat disappointed in the quiet,\nunostentatious general rooms.  The suite assigned them--at a\nhundred and twenty francs a day--was comfortable, was the most\ncomfortable assemblage of rooms either had ever seen.  But\nthere was nothing imposing.  This impression did not last\nlong, however.  They had been misled by their American passion\nfor looks.  They soon discovered that the guide at Naples had\ntold the literal truth.  They went down for tea in the garden,\nwhich was filled as the day was summer warm.  Neither spoke as\nthey sat under a striped awning umbrella, she with tea\nuntasted before her, he with a glass of whiskey and soda he\ndid not lift from the little table.  Their eyes and their\nthoughts were too busy for speech; one cannot talk when one is\nthinking.  About them were people of the world of which\nneither had before had any but a distant glimpse.  They heard\nEnglish, American, French, Italian.  They saw men and women\nwith that air which no one can define yet everyone knows on\nsight--the assurance without impertinence, the politeness\nwithout formality, the simplicity that is more complex than\nthe most elaborate ornamentation of dress or speech or manner.\nSusan and Freddie lingered until the departure of the last\ncouple--a plainly dressed man whose clothes on inspection\nrevealed marvels of fineness and harmonious color; a quietly\ndressed woman whose costume from tip of plume to tip of suede\nslipper was a revelation of how fine a fine art the toilet can\nbe made.\n\n\"Well--we're right in it, for sure,\" said Freddie, dropping to\na sofa in their suite and lighting a cigarette.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan, with a sigh.  \"In it--but not of it.\"\n\n\"I almost lost my nerve as I sat there.  And for the life of\nme I can't tell why.\"\n\n\"Those people know how,\" replied Susan.  \"Well--what they've\nlearned we can learn.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said he energetically.  \"It's going to take a lot of\npractice--a lot of time.  But I'm game.\"  His expression, its\nsuggestion of helplessness and appeal, was a clear confession\nof a feeling that she was his superior.\n\n\"We're both of us ignorant,\" she hastened to say.  \"But when\nwe get our bearings--in a day or two--we'll be all right.\"\n\n\"Let's have dinner up here in the sitting-room.  I haven't got\nthe nerve to face that gang again today\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" laughed she.  \"We mustn't give way to our\nfeelings--not for a minute.  There'll be a lot of people as\nbadly off as we are.  I saw some this afternoon--and from the\nway the waiters treated them, I know they had money or\nsomething.  Put on your evening suit, and you'll be all right.\nI'm the one that hasn't anything to wear.  But I've got to go\nand study the styles.  I must begin to learn what to wear and\nnow to wear it.  We've come to the right place, Freddie.\nCheer up!\"\n\nHe felt better when he was in evening clothes which made him\nhandsome indeed, bringing out all his refinement of feature\nand coloring.  He was almost cheerful when Susan came into the\nsitting-room in the pale gray of her two new toilettes.  It\nmight be, as she insisted, that she was not dressed properly\nfor fashionable dining; but there would be no more delicate,\nno more lady-like loveliness.  He quite recovered his nerve\nwhen they faced the company that had terrified him in\nprospect.  He saw many commonplace looking people, not a few\nwho were downright dowdy.  And presently he had the\nsatisfaction of realizing that not only Susan but he also was\ngetting admiring attention.  He no longer floundered\npanic-stricken; his feet touched bottom and he felt foolish\nabout his sensations of a few minutes before.\n\nAfter all, the world over, dining in a restaurant is nothing\nbut dining in a restaurant.  The waiter and the head waiter\nspoke English, were gracefully, tactfully, polite; and as he\nordered he found his self-confidence returning with the\nsurging rush of a turned tide on a low shore.  The food was\nwonderful, and the champagne, \"English taste,\" was the best he\nhad ever drunk.  Halfway through dinner both he and Susan were\nin the happiest frame of mind.  The other people were drinking\ntoo, were emerging from caste into humanness.  Women gazed\nlanguorously and longingly at the handsome young American; men\nsent stealthy or open smiles of adoration at Susan whenever\nFreddie's eyes were safely averted.  But Susan was more\ncareful than a woman of the world to which she aspired would\nhave been; she ignored the glances and without difficulty\nassumed the air of wife.\n\n\"I don't believe we'll have any trouble getting acquainted\nwith these people,\" said Freddie.\n\n\"We don't want to, yet,\" replied she.\n\n\"Oh, I feel we'll soon be ready for them,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes--that,\" said she.  \"But that amounts to nothing.  This\nisn't to be merely a matter of clothes and acquaintances--at\nleast, not with me.\"\n\n\"What then?\" inquired he.\n\n\"Oh--we'll see as we get our bearings.\"  She could not have\nput into words the plans she was forming--plans for educating\nand in every way developing him and herself.  She was not sure\nat what she was aiming, but only of the direction.  She had no\nidea how far she could go herself--or how far he would consent\nto go.  The wise course was just to work along from day to\nday--keeping the direction.\n\n\"All right.  I'll do as you say.  You've got this game sized\nup better than I.\"\n\nIs there any other people that works as hard as do the\nParisians?  Other peoples work with their bodies; but the\nParisians, all classes and masses too, press both mind and\nbody into service.  Other peoples, if they think at all, think\nhow to avoid work; the Parisians think incessantly, always,\nhow to provide themselves with more to do.  Other peoples\ndrink to stupefy themselves lest peradventure in a leisure\nmoment they might be seized of a thought; Parisians drink to\nstimulate themselves, to try to think more rapidly, to attract\nideas that might not enter and engage a sober and therefore\nsomewhat sluggish brain.  Other peoples meet a new idea as if\nit were a mortal foe; the Parisians as if it were a long-lost\nfriend.  Other peoples are agitated chiefly, each man or\nwoman, about themselves; the Parisians are full of their work,\ntheir surroundings, bother little about themselves except as\nmeans to what they regard as the end and aim of life--to make\nthe world each moment as different as possible from what it\nwas the moment before, to transform the crass and sordid\nuniverse of things with the magic of ideas.  Being\nintelligent, they prefer good to evil; but they have God's own\nhorror of that which is neither good nor evil, and spew it out\nof their mouths.\n\nAt the moment of the arrival of Susan and Palmer the world\nthat labors at amusing itself was pausing in Paris on its way\nfrom the pleasures of sea and mountains to the pleasures of\nthe Riviera and Egypt.  And as the weather held fine, day\nafter day the streets, the cafés, the restaurants, offered the\nyoung adventurers an incessant dazzling panorama of all they\nhad come abroad to seek.  A week passed before Susan permitted\nherself to enter any of the shops where she intended to buy\ndresses, hats and the other and lesser paraphernalia of the\nwoman of fashion.\n\n\"I mustn't go until I've seen,\" said she.  \"I'd yield to the\ntemptation to buy and would regret it.\"\n\nAnd Freddie, seeing her point, restrained his impatience for\nmaking radical changes in himself and in her.  The fourth day\nof their stay at Paris he realized that he would buy, and\nwould wish to buy, none of the things that had tempted him the\nfirst and second days.  Secure in the obscurity of the crowd\nof strangers, he was losing his extreme nervousness about\nhimself.  That sort of emotion is most characteristic of\nAmericans and gets them the reputation for profound\nsnobbishness.  In fact, it is not snobbishness at all.  In no\ncountry on earth is ignorance in such universal disrepute as\nin America.  The American, eager to learn, eager to be abreast\nof the foremost, is terrified into embarrassment and awe when\nhe finds himself in surroundings where are things that he\nfeels he ought to know about--while a stupid fellow, in such\ncircumstances, is calmly content with himself, wholly unaware\nof his own deficiencies.\n\nSusan let full two weeks pass before she, with much\nhesitation, gave her first order toward the outfit on which\nPalmer insisted upon her spending not less than five thousand\ndollars.  Palmer had been going to the shops with her.  She\nwarned him it would make prices higher if she appeared with a\nprosperous looking man; but he wanted occupation and\neverything concerning her fascinated him now.  His ignorance\nof the details of feminine dress was giving place rapidly to\na knowledge which he thought profound--and it was profound,\nfor a man.  She would not permit him to go with her to order,\nhowever, or to fittings.  All she would tell him in advance\nabout this first dress was that it was for evening wear and\nthat its color was green.  \"But not a greeny green,\" said she.\n\n\"I understand.  A green something like the tint in your skin\nat the nape of your neck.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" admitted she.  \"Yes.\"\n\n\"We'll go to the opera the evening it comes home.  I'll have\nmy new evening outfit from Charvet's by that time.\"\n\nIt was about ten days after this conversation that she told\nhim she had had a final fitting, had ordered the dress sent\nhome.  He was instantly all excitement and rushed away to\nengage a good box for the opera.  With her assistance he had\ngot evening clothes that sent through his whole being a glow\nof self-confidence--for he knew that in those clothes, he\nlooked what he was striving to be.  They were to dine at\nseven.  He dressed early and went into their sitting-room.\nHe was afraid he would spoil his pleasure of complete surprise\nby catching a glimpse of the _grande toilette_ before it was\nfinished.  At a quarter past seven Susan put her head into the\nsitting-room--only her head.  At sight of his anxious face,\nhis tense manner, she burst out laughing.  It seemed, and was,\ngrotesque that one so imperturbable of surface should be so upset.\n\n\"Can you stand the strain another quarter of an hour?\" said she.\n\n\"Don't hurry,\" he urged.  \"Take all the time you want.  Do the\nthing up right.\"  He rose and came toward her with one hand\nbehind him.  \"You said the dress was green, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well--here's something you may be able to fit in somewhere.\"\nAnd he brought the concealed hand into view and held a jewel\nbox toward her.\n\nShe reached a bare arm through the crack in the door and took\nit.  The box, the arm, the head disappeared.  Presently there\nwas a low cry of delight that thrilled him.  The face\nreappeared.  \"Oh--Freddie!\" she exclaimed, radiant.  \"You must\nhave spent a fortune on them.\"\n\n\"No.  Twelve thousand--that's all.  It was a bargain.  Go on\ndressing.  We'll talk about it afterward.\"  And he gently\npushed her head back--getting a kiss in the palm of his\nhand--and drew the door to.\n\nTen minutes later the door opened part way again.  \"Brace\nyourself,\" she called laughingly.  \"I'm coming.\"\n\nA breathless pause and the door swung wide.  He stared with\neyes amazed and bewitched.  There is no more describing the\neffects of a harmonious combination of exquisite dress and\nexquisite woman than there is reproducing in words the magic\nand the thrill of sunrise or sunset, of moonlight's fanciful\namorous play, or of starry sky.  As the girl stood there, her\neyes starlike with excitement, her lips crimson and sensuous\nagainst the clear old-ivory pallor of her small face in its\nframe of glorious dark hair, it seemed to him that her soul,\nmore beautiful counterpart of herself, had come from its\ndwelling place within and was hovering about her body like an\naureole.  Round her lovely throat was the string of emeralds.\nHer shoulders were bare and also her bosom, over nearly half\nits soft, girlish swell.  And draped in light and clinging\ngrace about her slender, sensuous form was the most wonderful\ngarment he had ever seen.  The great French designers of\ndresses and hats and materials have a genius for taking an\nidea--a pure poetical abstraction--and materializing it,\nmaking it visible and tangible without destroying its\nspirituality.  This dress of Susan's did not suggest matter\nany more than the bar of music suggests the rosined string\nthat has given birth to it.  She was carrying the train and a\npair of long gloves in one hand.  The skirt, thus drawn back,\nrevealed her slim, narrow foot, a slender slipper of pale\ngreen satin, a charming instep with a rosiness shimmering\nthrough the gossamer web of pale green silk, the outline of a\nlong, slender leg whose perfection was guaranteed by the\nbeauty of her bare arm.\n\nHis expression changed slowly from bedazzlement to the nearest\napproach to the old slumbrous, smiling wickedness she had seen\nsince they started.  And her sensitive instinct understood; it\nwas the menace of an insane jealousy, sprung from fear--fear of\nlosing her.  The look vanished, and once again he was Freddie\nPalmer the delighted, the generous and almost romantically\nconsiderate, because everything was going as he wished.\n\n\"No wonder I went crazy about you,\" he said.\n\n\"Then you're not disappointed?\"\n\nHe came to her, unclasped the emeralds, stood off and viewed\nher again.  \"No--you mustn't wear them,\" said he.\n\n\"Oh!\" she cried, protesting.  \"They're the best of all.\"\n\n\"Not tonight,\" said he.  \"They look cheap.  They spoil the\neffect of your neck and shoulders.  Another time, when you're\nnot quite so wonderful, but not tonight.\"\n\nAs she could not see herself as he saw her, she pleaded for\nthe jewels.  She loved jewels and these were the first she had\never had, except two modest little birthday rings she had left\nin Sutherland.  But he led her to the long mirror and\nconvinced her that he was right.  When they descended to the\ndining-room, they caused a stir.  It does not take much to\nmake fashionable people stare; but it does take something to\nmake a whole room full of them quiet so far toward silence\nthat the discreet and refined handling of dishes in a\nrestaurant like the Ritz sounds like a vulgar clatter.  Susan\nand Palmer congratulated themselves that they had been at the\nhotel long enough to become acclimated and so could act as if\nthey were unconscious of the sensation they were creating.\nWhen they finished dinner, they found all the little tables in\nthe long corridor between the restaurant and the entrance\ntaken by people lingering over coffee to get another and\ncloser view.  And the men who looked at her sweet dreaming\nviolet-gray eyes said she was innocent; those who looked at\nher crimson lips said she was gay; those who saw both eyes and\nlips said she was innocent--as yet.  A few very dim-sighted,\nand very wise, retained their reason sufficiently to say that\nnothing could be told about a woman from her looks--especially\nan American woman.  She put on the magnificent cloak, white\nsilk, ermine lined, which he had seen at Paquin's and had\ninsisted on buying.  And they were off for the opera in the\naristocratic looking auto he was taking by the week.\n\nShe had a second triumph at the opera--was the center that\ndrew all glasses the instant the lights went up for the\nintermission.  There were a few minutes when her head was\nquite turned, when it seemed to her that she had arrived very\nnear to the highest goal of human ambition--said goal being\nthe one achieved and so self-complacently occupied by these\nluxurious, fashionable people who were paying her the tribute\nof interest and admiration.  Were not these people at the top\nof the heap?  Was she not among them, of them, by right of\nexcellence in the things that made them, distinguished them?\n\nAmbition, drunk and heavy with luxury, flies sluggishly and low.\nAnd her ambition was--for the moment--in danger of that fate.\n\nDuring the last intermission the door of their box opened.  At\nonce Palmer sprang up and advanced with beaming face and\nextended hand to welcome the caller.\n\n\"Hello, Brent, I _am_ glad to see you!  I want to introduce you\nto Mrs. Palmer\"--that name pronounced with the unconscious\npride of the possessor of _the_ jewel.\n\nBrent bowed.  Susan forced a smile.\n\n\"We,\" Palmer hastened on, \"are on a sort of postponed\nhoneymoon.  I didn't announce the marriage--didn't want to have\nmy friends out of pocket for presents.  Besides, they'd have\nsent us stuff fit only to furnish out a saloon or a hotel--and\nwe'd have had to use it or hurt their feelings.  My wife's a\nWestern girl--from Indiana.  She came on to study for the\nstage.  But\"--he laughed delightedly--\"I persuaded her to\nchange her mind.\"\n\n\"You are from the West?\" said Brent in the formal tone one\nuses in addressing a new acquaintance.  \"So am I.  But that's\nmore years ago than you could count.  I live in New York--when\nI don't live here or in the Riviera.\"\n\nThe moment had passed when Susan could, without creating an\nimpossible scene, admit and compel Brent to admit that they\nknew each other.  What did it matter?  Was it not best to\nignore the past?  Probably Brent had done this deliberately,\nassuming that she was beginning a new life with a clean slate.\n\n\"Been here long?\" said Brent to Palmer.\n\nAs he and Palmer talked, she contrasted the two men.  Palmer\nwas much the younger, much the handsomer.  Yet in the\ncomparison Brent had the advantage.  He looked as if he\namounted to a great deal, as if he had lived and had\nunderstood life as the other man could not.  The physical\ndifference between them was somewhat the difference between\nlook of lion and look of tiger.  Brent looked strong; Palmer,\ndangerous.  She could not imagine either man failing of a\npurpose he had set his heart upon.  She could not imagine\nBrent reaching for it in any but an open, direct, daring way.\nShe knew that the descendant of the supple Italians, the\ngraduate of the street schools of stealth and fraud, would not\ncare to have anything unless he got it by skill at subtlety.\nShe noted their dress.  Brent was wearing his clothes in that\nelegantly careless way which it was one of Freddie's\ndreams--one of the vain ones--to attain.  Brent's voice was\nmuch more virile, was almost harsh, and in pronouncing some\nwords made the nerves tingle with a sensation of mingled\nirritation and pleasure.  Freddie's voice was manly enough,\nbut soft and dangerous, suggestive of hidden danger.  She\ncompared the two men, as she knew them.  She wondered how they\nwould seem to a complete stranger.  Palmer, she thought, would\nbe able to attract almost any woman he might want; it seemed\nto her that a woman Brent wanted would feel rather helpless\nbefore the onset he would make.\n\nIt irritated her, this untimely intrusion of Brent who had the\ncurious quality of making all other men seem less in the\ncomparison.  Not that he assumed anything, or forced\ncomparisons; on the contrary, no man could have insisted less\nupon himself.  Not that he compelled or caused the transfer of\nall interest to himself.  Simply that, with him there, she\nfelt less hopeful of Palmer, less confident of his ability to\nbecome what he seemed--and go beyond it.  There are occasional\nmen who have this same quality that Susan was just then\nfeeling in Brent--men whom women never love yet who make it\nimpossible for them to begin to love or to continue to love\nthe other men within their range.\n\nShe was not glad to see him.  She did not conceal it.  Yet she\nknew that he would linger--and that she would not oppose.  She\nwould have liked to say to him:  \"You lost belief in me and\ndropped me.  I have begun to make a life for myself.  Let me\nalone.  Do not upset me--do not force me to see what I must\nnot see if I am to be happy.  Go away, and give me a chance.\"\nBut we do not say these frank, childlike things except in\nmoments of closest intimacy--and certainly there was no\nsuggestion of intimacy, no invitation to it, but the reverse,\nin the man facing her at the front of the box.\n\n\"Then you are to be in Paris some time?\" said Brent,\naddressing her.\n\n\"I think so,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Sure,\" cried Palmer.  \"This is the town the world revolves\nround.  I felt like singing 'Home, Sweet Home' as we drove\nfrom the station.\"\n\n\"I like it better than any place on earth,\" said Brent.\n\"Better even than New York.  I've never been quite able to\nforgive New York for some of the things it made me suffer\nbefore it gave me what I wanted.\"\n\n\"I, too,\" said Freddie.  \"My wife can't understand that.  She\ndoesn't know the side of life we know.  I'm going to smoke a\ncigarette.  I'll leave you here, old man, to entertain her.\"\n\nWhen he disappeared, Susan looked out over the house with an\nexpression of apparent abstraction.  Brent--she was\nconscious--studied her with those seeing eyes--hazel eyes\nwith not a bit of the sentimentality and weakness of brown in\nthem.  \"You and Palmer know no one here?\"\n\n\"Not a soul.\"\n\n\"I'll be glad to introduce some of my acquaintances to\nyou--French people of the artistic set.  They speak English.\nAnd you'll soon be learning French.\"\n\n\"I intend to learn as soon as I've finished my fall shopping.\"\n\n\"You are not coming back to America?\"\n\n\"Not for a long time.\"\n\n\"Then you will find my friends useful.\"\n\nShe turned her eyes upon his.  \"You are very kind,\" said she.\n\"But I'd rather--we'd rather--not meet anyone just yet.\"\n\nHis eyes met hers calmly.  It was impossible to tell whether\nhe understood or not.  After a few seconds he glanced out over\nthe house.  \"That is a beautiful dress,\" said he.  \"You have\nreal taste, if you'll permit me to say so.  I was one of those\nwho were struck dumb with admiration at the Ritz tonight.\"\n\n\"It's the first grand dress I ever possessed,\" said she.\n\n\"You love dresses--and jewels--and luxury?\"\n\n\"As a starving man loves food.\"\n\n\"Then you are happy?\"\n\n\"Perfectly so--for the first time in my life.\"\n\n\"It is a kind of ecstasy--isn't it?  I remember how it was\nwith me.  I had always been poor--I worked my way through prep\nschool and college.  And I wanted _all_ the luxuries.  The more\nI had to endure--the worse food and clothing and lodgings--the\nmadder I became about them, until I couldn't think of anything\nbut getting the money to buy them.  When I got it, I gorged\nmyself. . . .  It's a pity the starving man can't keep on loving\nfood--keep on being always starving and always having his\nhunger satisfied.\"\n\n\"Ah, but he can.\"\n\nHe smiled mysteriously.  \"You think so, now.  Wait till you\nare gorged.\"\n\nShe laughed.  \"You don't know!  I could never get enough--never!\"\n\nHis smile became even more mysterious.  As he looked away, his\nprofile presented itself to her view--an outline of sheer\nstrength, of tragic sadness--the profile of those who have\ndreamed and dared and suffered.  But the smile, saying no to\nher confident assertion, still lingered.\n\n\"Never!\" she repeated.  She must compel that smile to take\naway its disquieting negation, its relentless prophecy of the\nend of her happiness.  She must convince him that he had come\nback in vain, that he could not disturb her.\n\n\"You don't suggest to me the woman who can be content with\njust people and just things.  You will always insist on\nluxury.  But you will demand more.\"  He looked at her again.\n\"And you will get it,\" he added, in a tone that sent a wave\nthrough her nerves.\n\nHer glance fell.  Palmer came in, bringing an odor of cologne\nand of fresh cigarette fumes.  Brent rose.  Palmer laid a\ndetaining hand on his shoulder.  \"Do stay on, Brent, and go to\nsupper with us.\"\n\n\"I was about to ask you to supper with me.  Have you been to\nthe Abbaye?\"\n\n\"No.  We haven't got round to that yet.  Is it lively?\"\n\n\"And the food's the best in Paris.  You'll come?\"\n\nBrent was looking at Susan.  Palmer, not yet educated in the\nsmaller--and important--refinements of politeness, did not\nwait for her reply or think that she should be consulted.\n\"Certainly,\" said he.  \"On condition that you dine with us\ntomorrow night.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" agreed Brent.  And he excused himself to take\nleave of his friends.  \"Just tell your chauffeur to go to the\nAbbaye--he'll know,\" he said as he bowed over Susan's hand.\n\"I'll be waiting.  I wish to be there ahead and make sure of\na table.\"\n\nAs the door of the box closed upon him Freddie burst out with\nthat enthusiasm we feel for one who is in a position to render\nus good service and is showing a disposition to do so.  \"I've\nknown him for years,\" said he, \"and he's the real thing.  He\nused to spend a lot of time in a saloon I used to keep in\nAllen Street.\"\n\n\"Allen Street?\" ejaculated Susan, shivering.\n\n\"I was twenty-two then.  He used to want to study types, as he\ncalled it.  And I gathered in types for him--though really my\nplace was for the swell crooks and their ladies.  How long ago\nthat seems--and how far away!\"\n\n\"Another life,\" said Susan.\n\n\"That's a fact.  This is my second time on earth.  _Our_ second time.\nI tell you it's fighting for a foothold that makes men and women\nthe wretches they are.  Nowadays, I couldn't hurt a fly--could you?\nBut then you never were cruel.  That's why you stayed down so long.\"\n\nSusan smiled into the darkness of the auditorium--the curtain was\nup, and they were talking in undertones.  She said, as she smiled:\n\n\"I'll never go down and stay down for that reason again.\"\n\nHer tone arrested his attention; but he could make nothing of\nit or of her expression, though her face was clear enough in\nthe reflection from the footlights.\n\n\"Anyhow, Brent and I are old pals,\" continued he, \"though we\nhaven't seen so much of each other since he made a hit with\nthe plays.  He always used to predict I'd get to the top and\nbe respectable.  Now that it's come true, he'll help me.\nHe'll introduce us, if we work it right.\"\n\n\"But we don't want that yet,\" protested Susan.\n\n\"You're ready and so am I,\" declared Palmer in the tone she\nknew had the full strength of his will back of it.\n\nFaint angry hissing from the stalls silenced them, but as\nsoon as they were in the auto Susan resumed.  \"I have told Mr.\nBrent we don't want to meet his friends yet.\"\n\n\"Now what the hell did you do that for?\" demanded Freddie.  It\nwas the first time she had crossed him; it was the first time\nhe had been reminiscent of the Freddie she used to know.\n\n\"Because,\" said she evenly, \"I will not meet people under\nfalse pretenses.\"\n\n\"What rot!\"\n\n\"I will not do it,\" replied she in the same quiet way.\n\nHe assumed that she meant only one of the false pretenses--the\none that seemed the least to her.  He said:\n\n\"Then we'll draw up and sign a marriage contract and date it\na couple of years ago, before the new marriage law was passed\nto save rich men's drunken sons from common law wives.\"\n\n\"I am already married,\" said Susan.  \"To a farmer out in Indiana.\"\n\nFreddie laughed.  \"Well, I'll be damned!  You!  You!\"  He\nlooked at her ermine-lined cloak and laughed again.  \"An\nIndiana farmer!\"  Then he suddenly sobered.  \"Come to think of\nit,\" said he, \"that's the first thing you ever told me about\nyour past.\"\n\n\"Or anybody else,\" said Susan.  Her body was quivering, for we\nremember the past events with the sensations they made upon us\nat the time.  She could smell that little room in the\nfarmhouse.  Allen Street and all the rest of her life in the\nunderworld had for her something of the vagueness of\ndreams--not only now but also while she was living that life.\nBut not Ferguson, not the night when her innocent soul was\nravished as a wolf rips up and munches a bleating lamb.  No\nvagueness of dreams about that, but a reality to make her\nshudder and reel whenever she thought of it--a reality vivider\nnow that she was a woman grown in experiences and understanding.\n\n\"He's probably dead--or divorced you long ago.\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"I can find out--without stirring things up.  What was his name?\"\n\n\"Ferguson.\"\n\n\"What was his first name?\"\n\nShe tried to recall.  \"I think--it was Jim.  Yes, it was Jim.\"\nShe fancied she could hear the voice of that ferocious sister\nsnapping out that name in the miserable little coop of a\ngeneral room in that hot, foul, farm cottage.\n\n\"Where did he live?\"\n\n\"His farm was at the edge of Zeke Warham's place--not far from\nBeecamp, in Jefferson County.\"\n\nShe lapsed into silence, seemed to be watching the gay night\nstreets of the Montmartre district--the cafés, the music\nhalls, the sidewalk shows, the throngs of people every man and\nwoman of them with his or her own individual variation upon\nthe fascinating, covertly terrible face of the Paris mob.\n\"What are you thinking about?\" he asked, when a remark brought\nno answer.\n\n\"The past,\" said she.  \"And the future.\"\n\n\"Well--we'll find out in a few days that your farmer's got no\nclaim on you--and we'll attend to that marriage contract and\neverything'll be all right.\"\n\n\"Do you want to marry me?\" she asked, turning on him suddenly.\n\n\"We're as good as married already,\" replied he.  \"Your tone\nsounds as if _you_ didn't want to marry _me_.\"  And he laughed\nat the absurdity of such an idea.\n\n\"I don't know whether I do or not,\" said she slowly.\n\nHe laid a gentle strong hand on her knee.  Gentle though it\nwas, she felt its strength through the thickness of her cloak.\n\"When the time comes,\" said he in the soft voice with the\nmenace hidden in it, \"you'll know whether you do or don't.\nYou'll know you _do_--Queenie.\"\n\nThe auto was at the curb before the Abbaye.  And on the steps,\nin furs and a top hat, stood the tall, experienced looking,\ncynical looking playwright.  Susan's eyes met his, he lifted\nhis hat, formal, polite.\n\n\"I'll bet he's got the best table in the place,\" said Palmer,\nbefore opening the door, \"and I'll bet it cost him a bunch.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nBRENT had an apartment in the rue de Rivoli, near the Hotel\nMeurice and high enough to command the whole Tuileries garden.\nFrom his balcony he could see to the east the ancient courts\nof the Louvre, to the south the varied, harmonious façades of\nthe Quay d'Orsay with the domes and spires of the Left Bank\nbehind, to the west the Obélisque, the long broad reaches of\nthe Champs Elysées with the Arc de Triomphe at the boundary of\nthe horizon.  On that balcony, with the tides of traffic far\nbelow, one had a sense of being at the heart of the world,\npast, present, and to come.  Brent liked to feel at home\nwherever he was; it enabled him to go tranquilly to work\nwithin a few minutes after his arrival, no matter how far he\nhad journeyed or how long he had been away.  So he regarded it\nas an economy, an essential to good work, to keep up the house\nin New York, a villa in Petite Afrique, with the Mediterranean\nwashing its garden wall, this apartment at Paris; and a\ntelegram a week in advance would reserve him the same quarters\nin the quietest part of hotels at Luzerne, at St. Moritz and\nat Biarritz.\n\nSusan admired, as he explained his scheme of life to her and\nPalmer when they visited his apartment.  Always profound\ntranquillity in the midst of intense activity.  He could shut\nhis door and he as in a desert; he could open it, and the most\ninteresting of the sensations created by the actions and\nreactions of the whole human race were straightway beating\nupon his senses.  As she listened, she looked about, her eyes\ntaking in impressions to be studied at leisure.  These\nquarters of his in Paris were fundamentally different from\nthose in New York, were the expression of a different side of\nhis personality.  It was plain that he loved them, that they\ncame nearer to expressing his real--that is, his inmost--self.\n\n\"Though I work harder in Paris than in New York,\" he\nexplained, \"I have more leisure because it is all one kind of\nwork--writing--at which I'm never interrupted.  So I have time\nto make surroundings for myself.  No one has time for\nsurroundings in New York.\"\n\nShe observed that of the scores of pictures on the walls,\ntables, shelves of the three rooms they were shown, every one\nwas a face--faces of all nationalities, all ages, all\nconditions--faces happy and faces tragic, faces homely, faces\nbeautiful, faces irradiating the fascination of those abnormal\ndevelopments of character, good and bad, which give the\ncomposite countenance of the human race its distinction, as\nthe characteristics themselves give it intensities of light\nand shade.  She saw angels, beautiful and ugly, devils\nbeautiful and ugly.\n\nWhen she began to notice this peculiarity of those rooms, she\nwas simply interested.  What an amazing collection!  How much\ntime and thought it must have taken!  How he must have\nsearched--and what an instinct he had for finding the unusual,\nthe significant!  As she sat there and then strolled about and\nthen sat again, her interest rose into a feverish excitement.\nIt was as if the ghosts of all these personalities, not one of\nthem commonplace, were moving through the rooms, were pressing\nupon her.  She understood why Brent had them there--that they\nwere as necessary to him as cadavers and skeletons and\nphysiological charts to an anatomist.  But they oppressed,\nsuffocated her; she went out on the balcony and watched the\neffects of the light from the setting sun upon and around the\nenormously magnified Arc.\n\n\"You don't like my rooms,\" said Brent.\n\n\"They fascinate me,\" replied she.  \"But I'd have to get used to\nthese friends of yours.  You made their acquaintance one or a few\nat a time.  It's very upsetting, being introduced to all at once.\"\n\nShe felt Brent's gaze upon her--that unfathomable look which\nmade her uneasy, yet was somehow satisfying, too.  He said, after\na while, \"Palmer is to give me his photograph.  Will you give me\nyours?\"  He was smiling.  \"Both of you belong in my gallery.\"\n\n\"Of course she will,\" said Palmer, coming out on the balcony\nand standing beside her.  \"I want her to have some taken right\naway--in the evening dress she wore to the Opera last week.\nAnd she must have her portrait painted.\"\n\n\"When we are settled,\" said Susan.  \"I've no time for anything\nnow but shopping.\"\n\nThey had come to inspect the apartment above Brent's, and had\ndecided to take it; Susan saw possibilities of making it over\ninto the sort of environment of which she had dreamed.  In\nnovels the descriptions of interiors, which weary most\nreaders, interested her more than story or characters.  In her\ndays of abject poverty she used these word paintings to\nconstruct for herself a room, suites of rooms, a whole house,\nto replace, when her physical eyes closed and her eyes of\nfancy opened wide, the squalid and nauseous cell to which\npoverty condemned her.  In the streets she would sometimes\npause before a shop window display of interior furnishings; a\nbeautiful table or chair, a design in wall or floor covering\nhad caught her eyes, had set her to dreaming--dreaming on and\non--she in dingy skirt and leaky shoes.  Now--the chance to\nrealize her dreams had come.  Palmer had got acquainted with\nsome high-class sports, American, French and English, at an\nAmerican bar in the rue Volney.  He was spending his\nafternoons and some of his evenings with them--in the\nevenings winning large sums from them at cards at which he\nwas now as lucky as at everything else.  Palmer, pleased by\nBrent's manner toward Susan--formal politeness, indifference to\nsex--was glad to have him go about with her.  Also Palmer was\none of those men who not merely imagine they read human nature\nbut actually can read it.  He _knew_ he could trust Susan.  And\nit had been his habit--as it is the habit of all successful\nmen--to trust human beings, each one up to his capacity for\nresisting temptation to treachery.\n\n\"Brent doesn't care for women--as women,\" said he.  \"He never\ndid.  Don't you think he's queer?\"\n\n\"He's different,\" replied Susan.  \"He doesn't care much for\npeople--to have them as intimates.  I understand why.  Love\nand friendship bore one--or fail one--and are\nunsatisfactory--and disturbing.  But if one centers one's life\nabout things--books, pictures, art, a career--why, one is\nnever bored or betrayed.  He has solved the secret of\nhappiness, I think.\"\n\n\"Do you think a woman could fall in love with him?\" he asked,\nwith an air of the accidental and casual.\n\n\"If you mean, could I fall in love with him,\" said she, \"I\nshould say no.  I think it would either amuse or annoy him to\nfind that a woman cared about him.\"\n\n\"Amuse him most of all,\" said Palmer.  \"He knows the\nladies--that they love us men for what we can give them.\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear of anyone, man or woman, who cared about a\nperson who couldn't give them anything?\"\n\nFreddie's laugh was admission that he thought her right.  \"The\nway to get on in politics,\" observed he, \"is to show men that\nit's to their best interest to support you.  And that's the\nway to get on in everything else--including love.\"\n\nSusan knew that this was the truth about life, as it appeared\nto her also.  But she could not divest herself of the human\naversion to hearing the cold, practical truth.  She wanted\nsugar coating on the pill, even though she knew the sugar made\nthe medicine much less effective, often neutralized it\naltogether.  Thus Palmer's brutally frank cynicism got upon\nher nerves, whereas Brent's equally frank cynicism attracted\nher because it was not brutal.  Both men saw that life was a\ncoarse practical joke.  Palmer put the stress on the\ncoarseness, Brent upon the humor.\n\nBrent recommended and introduced to her a friend of his, a\nyoung French Jew named Gourdain, an architect on the way up to\ncelebrity.  \"You will like his ideas and he will like yours,\"\nsaid Brent.\n\nShe had acquiesced in his insistent friendship for Palmer and\nher, but she had not lowered by an inch the barrier of her\nreserve toward him.  His speech and actions at all times,\nwhether Palmer was there or not; suggested that he respected\nthe barrier, regarded it as even higher and thicker than it\nwas.  Nevertheless she felt that he really regarded the\nbarrier as non-existent.  She said:\n\n\"But I've never told you my ideas.\"\n\n\"I can guess what they are.  Your surroundings will simply be\nan extension of your dress.\"\n\nShe would not have let him see--she would not have admitted to\nherself--how profoundly the subtle compliment pleased her.\n\nBecause a man's or a woman's intimate personal taste is good\nit by no means follows that he or she will build or decorate\nor furnish a house well.  In matters of taste, the greater\ndoes not necessarily include the less, nor does the less imply\nthe greater.  Perhaps Susan would have shown she did not\ndeserve Brent's compliment, would have failed ignominiously in\nthat first essay of hers, had she not found a Gourdain,\nsympathetic, able to put into the concrete the rather vague\nideas she had evolved in her dreaming.  An architect is like\na milliner or a dressmaker.  He supplies the model, product of\nhis own individual taste.  The person who employs him must\nremold that form into an expression of his own\npersonality--for people who deliberately live in surroundings\nthat are not part of themselves are on the same low level with\nthose who utter only borrowed ideas.  That is the object and\nthe aim of civilization--to encourage and to compel each\nindividual to be frankly himself--herself.  That is the\nprofound meaning of freedom.  The world owes more to bad\nmorals and to bad taste that are spontaneous than to all the\ndocile conformity to the standards of morals and of taste,\nhowever good.  Truth--which simply means an increase of\nharmony, a decrease of discord, between the internal man and\nhis environment--truth is a product, usually a byproduct, of\na ferment of action.\n\nGourdain--chiefly, no doubt, because Susan's beauty of face\nand figure and dress fascinated him--was more eager to bring\nout her individuality than to show off his own talents.  He\ntook endless pains with her, taught her the technical\nknowledge and vocabulary that would enable her to express\nherself, then carried out her ideas religiously.  \"You are\nright, _mon ami_,\" said he to Brent.  \"She is an orchid, and of\na rare species.  She has a glorious imagination, like a bird\nof paradise balancing itself into an azure sky, with every\nplume raining color and brilliancy.\"\n\n\"Somewhat exaggerated,\" was Susan's pleased, laughing comment\nwhen Brent told her.\n\n\"Somewhat,\" said Brent.  \"But my friend Gourdain is stark mad\nabout women's dressing well.  That lilac dress you had on\nyesterday did for him.  He _was_ your servant; he _is_ your slave.\"\n\nAbruptly--for no apparent cause, as was often the case--Susan\nhad that sickening sense of the unreality of her luxurious\npresent, of being about to awaken in Vine Street with Etta--or\nin the filthy bed with old Mrs. Tucker.  Absently she glanced\ndown at her foot, holding it out as if for inspection.  She\nsaw Brent's look of amusement at her seeming vanity.\n\n\"I was looking to see if my shoes were leaky,\" she explained.\n\nA subtle change came over his face.  He understood instantly.\n\n\"Have you ever been--cold?\" she asked, looking at him strangely.\n\n\"One cold February--cold and damp--I had no underclothes--and\nno overcoat.\"\n\n\"And dirty beds--filthy rooms--filthy people?\"\n\n\"A ten-cent lodging house with a tramp for bedfellow.\"\n\nThey were looking at each other, with the perfect understanding\nand sympathy that can come only to two people of the same fiber\nwho have braved the same storms.  Each glanced hastily away.\n\nHer enthusiasm for doing the apartment was due full as much to\nthe fact that it gave her definitely directed occupation as to\nits congeniality.  That early training of hers from Aunt Fanny\nWarham had made it forever impossible for her in any\ncircumstances to become the typical luxuriously sheltered\nwoman, whether legally or illegally kept--the lie-abed woman,\nthe woman who dresses only to go out and show off, the woman\nwho wastes her life in petty, piffling trifles--without\npurpose, without order or system, without morals or personal\nself-respect.  She had never lost the systematic instinct--the\ninstinct to use time instead of wasting it--that Fanny Warham\nhad implanted in her during the years that determine\ncharacter.  Not for a moment, even without distinctly definite\naim, was she in danger of the creeping paralysis that is\nepidemic among the rich, enfeebling and slowing down mental\nand physical activity.  She had a regular life; she read, she\nwalked in the Bois; she made the best of each day.  And when\nthis definite thing to accomplish offered, she did not have to\nlearn how to work before she could begin the work itself.\n\nAll this was nothing new to Gourdain.  He was born and bred in\na country where intelligent discipline is the rule and the\nlack of it the rare exception--among all classes--even among\nthe women of the well-to-do classes.\n\nThe finished apartment was a disappointment to Palmer.  Its\neffects were too quiet, too restrained.  Within certain small\nlimits, those of the man of unusual intelligence but no marked\noriginality, he had excellent taste--or, perhaps, excellent\nability to recognize good taste.  But in the large he yearned\nfor the grandiose.  He loved the gaudy with which the rich\nsurround themselves because good taste forbids them to talk of\ntheir wealth and such surroundings do the talking for them and\ndo it more effectively.  He would have preferred even a vulgar\nglitter to the unobtrusiveness of those rooms.  But he knew\nthat Susan was right, and he was a very human arrant coward\nabout admitting that he had bad taste.\n\n\"This is beautiful--exquisite,\" said he, with feigned\nenthusiasm.  \"I'm afraid, though, it'll be above their heads.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" inquired Susan.\n\nPalmer felt her restrained irritation, hastened to explain.\n\"I mean the people who'll come here.  They can't appreciate\nit.  You have to look twice to appreciate this--and people,\nthe best of 'em, look only once and a mighty blind look it is.\"\n\nBut Susan was not deceived.  \"You must tell me what changes\nyou want,\" said she.  Her momentary irritation had vanished.\nSince Freddie was paying, Freddie must have what suited him.\n\n\"Oh, I've got nothing to suggest.  Now that I've been studying\nit out, I couldn't allow you to make any changes.  It does\ngrow on one, doesn't it, Brent?\"\n\n\"It will be the talk of Paris,\" replied Brent.\n\nThe playwright's tone settled the matter for Palmer.  He was\ncontent.  Said he:\n\n\"Thank God she hasn't put in any of those dirty old tapestry\nrags--and the banged up, broken furniture and the patched crockery.\"\n\nAt the same time she had produced an effect of long tenancy.\nThere was nothing that glittered, nothing with the offensive\nsheen of the brand new.  There was in that delicately toned\natmosphere one suggestion which gave the same impression as\nthe artificial crimson of her lips in contrast with the pallor\nof her skin and the sweet thoughtful melancholy of her eyes.\nThis suggestion came from an all-pervading odor of a heavy,\nlanguorously sweet, sensuous perfume--the same that Susan\nherself used.  She had it made at a perfumer's in the faubourg\nSt. Honoré by mixing in a certain proportion several of the\nheaviest and most clinging of the familiar perfumes.\n\"You don't like my perfume?\" she said to Brent one day.\n\nHe was in the library, was inspecting her _selections_ of\nbooks.  Instead of answering her question, he said:\n\n\"How did you find out so much about books?  How did you find\ntime to read so many?\"\n\n\"One always finds time for what one likes.\"\n\n\"Not always,\" said he.  \"I had a hard stretch once--just after\nI struck New York.  I was a waiter for two months.  Working\npeople don't find time for reading--and such things.\"\n\n\"That was one reason why I gave up work,\" said she.\n\n\"That--and the dirt--and the poor wages--and the\nhopelessness--and a few other reasons,\" said he.\n\n\"Why don't you like the perfume I use?\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\"\n\n\"You made a queer face as you came into the drawing-room.\"\n\n\"Do _you_ like it?\"\n\n\"What a queer question!\" she said.  \"No other man would have\nasked it.\"\n\n\"The obvious,\" said he, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n\"I couldn't help knowing you didn't like it.\"\n\n\"Then why should I use it?\"\n\nHis glance drifted slowly away from hers.  He lit a cigarette\nwith much attention to detail.\n\n\"Why should I use perfume I don't like?\" persisted she.\n\n\"What's the use of going into that?\" said he.\n\n\"But I do like it--in a way,\" she went on after a pause.  \"It\nis--it seems to me the odor of myself.\"\n\n\"Yes--it is,\" he admitted.\n\nShe laughed.  \"Yet you made a wry face.\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"At the odor?\"\n\n\"At the odor.\"\n\n\"Do you think I ought to change to another perfume?\"\n\n\"You know I do not.  It's the odor of your soul.  It is\ndifferent at different times--sometimes inspiringly sweet as\nthe incense of heaven, as my metaphoric friend Gourdain would\nsay--sometimes as deadly sweet as the odors of the drugs men\ntake to drag them to hell--sometimes repulsively sweet, making\none heart sick for pure, clean smell-less air yet without the\ncourage to seek it.  Your perfume is many things, but\nalways--always strong and tenacious and individual.\"\n\nA flush had overspread the pallor of her skin; her long dark\nlashes hid her eyes.\n\n\"You have never been in love,\" he went on.\n\n\"So you told me once before.\"  It was the first time either\nhad referred to their New York acquaintance.\n\n\"You did not believe me then.  But you do now?\"\n\n\"For me there is no such thing as love,\" replied she.  \"I\nunderstand affection--I have felt it.  I understand passion.\nIt is a strong force in my life--perhaps the strongest.\"\n\n\"No,\" said he, quiet but positive.\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" replied she carelessly, and went on, with her\nmore than manlike candor, and in her manner of saying the most\nstartling things in the calmest way:\n\n\"I understand what is called love--feebleness looking up to\nstrength or strength pitying feebleness.  I understand because\nI've felt both those things.  But love--two equal people united\nperfectly, merged into a third person who is neither yet is\nboth--that I have not felt.  I've dreamed it.  I've imagined\nit--in some moments of passion.  But\"--she laughed and\nshrugged her shoulders and waved the hand with the cigarette\nbetween its fingers--\"I have not felt it and I shall not feel\nit.  I remain I.\"  She paused, considered, added, \"And I\nprefer that.\"\n\n\"You are strong,\" said he, absent and reflective.  \"Yes, you\nare strong.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied she.  \"Sometimes I think so.\nAgain----\"  She shook her head doubtfully.\n\n\"You would be dead if you were not.  As strong in soul as in body.\"\n\n\"Probably,\" admitted she.  \"Anyhow, I am sure I shall always\nbe--alone.  I shall visit--I shall linger on my threshold and\ntalk.  Perhaps I shall wander in perfumed gardens and dream of\ncomradeship.  But I shall return _chez moi_.\"\n\nHe rose--sighed--laughed--at her and at himself.  \"Don't delay\ntoo long,\" said he.\n\n\"Delay?\"\n\n\"Your career.\"\n\n\"My career?  Why, I am in the full swing of it.  I'm at work\nin the only profession I'm fit for.\"\n\n\"The profession of woman?\"\n\n\"Yes--the profession of female.\"\n\nHe winced--and at this sign, if she did not ask herself what\npleased her, she did not ask herself why.  He said sharply, \"I\ndon't like that.\"\n\n\"But _you_ have only to _hear_ it.  Think of poor me who have to\n_live_ it.\"\n\n\"Have to?  No,\" said he.\n\n\"Surely you're not suggesting that I drop back into the\nlaboring classes!  No, thank you.  If you knew, you'd not say\nanything so stupid.\"\n\n\"I do know, and I was not suggesting that.  Under this\ncapitalistic system the whole working class is degraded.\nThey call what they do 'work,' but that word ought to be\nreserved for what a man does when he exercises mind and body\nusefully.  What the working class is condemned to by\ncapitalism is not work but toil.\"\n\n\"The toil of a slave,\" said Susan.\n\n\"It's shallow twaddle or sheer want to talk about the dignity\nand beauty of labor under this system,\" he went on.  \"It is\nugly and degrading.  The fools or hypocrites who talk that way\nought to be forced to join the gangs of slaves at their tasks\nin factory and mine and shop, in the fields and the streets.\nAnd even the easier and better paid tasks, even what the\ncapitalists themselves do--those things aren't dignified and\nbeautiful.  Capitalism divides all men except those of one\nclass--the class to which I luckily belong--divides all other\nmen into three unlovely classes--slave owners, slave drivers\nand slaves.  But you're not interested in those questions.\"\n\n\"In wage slavery?  No.  I wish to forget about it.  Any\nalternative to being a wage slave or a slave driver--or a\nslave owner.  Any alternative.\"\n\n\"You don't appreciate your own good fortune,\" said he.  \"Most\nhuman beings--all but a very few--have to be in the slave\nclasses, in one way or another.  They have to submit to the\nrepulsive drudgery, with no advancement except to slave\ndriver.  As for women--if they have to work, what can they do\nbut sell themselves into slavery to the machines, to the\ncapitalists?  But you--you needn't do that.  Nature endowed\nyou with talent--unusual talent, I believe.  How lucky you\nare!  How superior to the great mass of your fellow beings who\nmust slave or starve, because they have no talent!\"\n\n\"Talent?--I?\" said Susan.  \"For what, pray?\"\n\n\"For the stage.\"\n\nShe looked amused.  \"You evidently don't think me vain--or\nyou'd not venture that jest.\"\n\n\"For the stage,\" he repeated.\n\n\"Thanks,\" said she drily, \"but I'll not appeal from your verdict.\"\n\n\"My verdict?  What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I prefer to talk of something else,\" said she coldly,\noffended by his unaccountable disregard of her feelings.\n\n\"This is bewildering,\" said he.  And his manner certainly\nfitted the words.\n\n\"That I should have understood?  Perhaps I shouldn't--at\nleast, not so quickly--if I hadn't heard how often you have\nbeen disappointed, and how hard it has been for you to get rid\nof some of those you tried and found wanting.\"\n\n\"Believe me--I was not disappointed in you.\"  He spoke\nearnestly, apparently with sincerity.  \"The contrary.  Your\nthrowing it all up was one of the shocks of my life.\"\n\nShe laughed mockingly--to hide her sensitiveness.\n\n\"One of the shocks of my life,\" he repeated.\n\nShe was looking at him curiously--wondering why he was thus uncandid.\n\n\"It puzzled me,\" he went on.  \"I've been lingering on here,\ntrying to solve the puzzle.  And the more I've seen of you the\nless I understand.  Why did you do it?  How could _you_ do it?\"\n\nHe was walking up and down the room in a characteristic pose--hands\nclasped behind his back as if to keep them quiet, body erect, head\npowerfully thrust forward.  He halted abruptly and wheeled to face\nher.  \"Do you mean to tell me you didn't get tired of work and\ndrop it for--\" he waved his arm to indicate her luxurious\nsurroundings--\"for this?\"\n\nNo sign of her agitation showed at the surface.  But she felt\nshe was not concealing herself from him.\n\nHe resumed his march, presently to halt and wheel again upon\nher.  But before he could speak, she stopped him.\n\n\"I don't wish to hear any more,\" said she, the strange look in\nher eyes.  It was all she could do to hide the wild burst of\nemotion that had followed her discovery.  Then she had not\nbeen without a chance for a real career!  She might have been\nfree, might have belonged to herself----\n\n\"It is not too late,\" cried he.  \"That's why I'm here.\"\n\n\"It is too late,\" she said.\n\n\"It is not too late,\" repeated he, harshly, in his way that\nswept aside opposition.  \"I shall get you back.\"\nTriumphantly, \"The puzzle is solved!\"\n\nShe faced him with a look of defiant negation.  \"That ocean I\ncrossed--it's as narrow as the East River into which I thought\nof throwing myself many a time--it's as narrow as the East\nRiver beside the ocean between what I am and what I was.  And\nI'll never go back.  Never!\"\n\nShe repeated the \"never\" quietly, under her breath.  His eyes\nlooked as if they, without missing an essential detail, had swept\nthe whole of that to which she would never go back.  He said:\n\n\"Go back?  No, indeed.  Who's asking you to go back?  Not I.\nI'm not _asking_ you to go anywhere.  I'm simply saying that\nyou will--_must_--go forward.  If you were in love, perhaps\nnot.  But you aren't in love.  I know from experience how men\nand women care for each other--how they form these\nrelationships.  They find each other convenient and\ncomfortable.  But they care only for themselves.  Especially\nyoung people.  One must live quite a while to discover that\nthinking about oneself is living in a stuffy little cage with\nonly a little light, through slats in the top that give no\nview. . . .  It's an unnatural life for you.  It can't last.\nYou--centering upon yourself--upon comfort and convenience.\nAbsurd!\"\n\n\"I have chosen,\" said she.\n\n\"No--you can't do it,\" he went on, as if she had not spoken.\n\"_You_ can't spend your life at dresses and millinery, at\nchattering about art, at thinking about eating and\ndrinking--at being passively amused--at attending to your hair\nand skin and figure.  You may think so, but in reality you are\ngetting ready for _me_ . . . for your career.  You are simply\neducating yourself.  I shall have you back.\"\n\nShe held the cigarette to her lips, inhaled the smoke deeply,\nexhaled it slowly.\n\n\"I will tell you why,\" he went on, as if he were answering a\nprotest.  \"Every one of us has an individuality of some sort.\nAnd in spite of everything and anything, except death or\nhopeless disease, that individuality will insist upon\nexpressing itself.\"\n\n\"Mine is expressing itself,\" said she with a light smile--the\nsmile of a light woman.\n\n\"You can't rest in this present life of yours.  Your\nindividuality is too strong.  It will have its way--and for all\nyour mocking smiling, you know I am right.  I understand how\nyou were tempted into it----\"\n\nShe opened her lips--changed her mind and stopped her lips\nwith her cigarette.\n\n\"I don't blame you--and it was just as well.  This life has\ntaught you--will teach you--will advance you in your\ncareer. . . .  Tell me, what gave you the idea that I was\ndisappointed?\"\n\nShe tossed her cigarette into the big ash tray.  \"As I told\nyou, it is too late.\"  She rose and looked at him with a\nstrange, sweet smile.  \"I've got any quantity of faults,\" said\nshe.  \"But there's one I haven't got.  I don't whine.\"\n\n\"You don't whine,\" assented he, \"and you don't lie--and you\ndon't shirk.  Men and women have been canonized for less.\nI understand that for some reason you can't talk about----\"\n\n\"Then why do you continue to press me?\" said she, a little coldly.\n\nHe accepted the rebuke with a bow.  \"Nevertheless,\" said he,\nwith raillery to carry off his persistence, \"I shall get you.\nIf not sooner, then when the specter of an obscure--perhaps\npoor--old age begins to agitate the rich hangings of youth's\nbanquet hall.\"\n\n\"That'll be a good many years yet,\" mocked she.  And from her\nlovely young face flashed the radiant defiance of her perfect\nyouth and health.\n\n\"Years that pass quickly,\" retorted he, unmoved.\n\nShe was still radiant, still smiling, but once more she was\nseeing the hideous old women of the tenements.  Into her\nnostrils stole the stench of the foul den in which she had\nslept with Mrs. Tucker and Mrs. Reardon--and she was hearing\nthe hunchback of the dive playing for the drunken dancing old\ncronies, with their tin cups of whiskey.\n\nNo danger of that now?  How little she was saving of her\nsalary from Palmer!  She could not \"work\" men--she simply\ncould not.  She would never put by enough to be independent\nand every day her tastes for luxury had firmer hold upon her.\nNo danger?  As much danger as ever--a danger postponed but\ncertain to threaten some day--and then, a fall from a greater\nheight--a certain fall.  She was hearing the battered,\nshattered piano of the dive.\n\n\"For pity's sake Mrs. Palmer!\" cried Brent, in a low voice.\n\nShe started.  The beautiful room, the environment of luxury\nand taste and comfort came back.\n\nGourdain interrupted and then Palmer.\n\nThe four went to the Cafe Anglais for dinner.  Brent announced\nthat he was going to the Riviera soon to join a party of\nfriends.  \"I wish you would visit me later,\" said he, with a\nglance that included them all and rested, as courtesy\nrequired, upon Susan.  \"There's room in my villa--barely room.\"\n\n\"We've not really settled here,\" said Susan.  \"And we've taken\nup French seriously.\"\n\n\"The weather's frightful,\" said Palmer, with a meaning glance\nat her.  \"I think we ought to go.\"\n\nBut her expression showed that she had no intention of going,\nno sympathy with Palmer's desire to use this excellent, easy\nladder of Brent's offering to make the ascent into secure\nrespectability.\n\n\"Next winter, then,\" said Brent, who was observing her.\n\"Or--in the early spring, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Oh, we may change our minds and come,\" Palmer suggested\neagerly.  \"I'm going to try to persuade my wife.\"\n\n\"Come if you can,\" said Brent cordially.  \"I'll have no one\nstopping with me.\"\n\nWhen they were alone, Palmer sent his valet away and fussed\nabout impatiently until Susan's maid had unhooked her dress\nand had got her ready for bed.  As the maid began the long\nprocess of giving her hair a thorough brushing, he said,\n\"Please let her go, Susan.  I want to tell you something.\"\n\n\"She does not know a word of English.\"\n\n\"But these French are so clever that they understand perfectly\nwith their eyes.\"\n\nSusan sent the maid to bed and sat in a dressing gown brushing\nher hair.  It was long enough to reach to the middle of her\nback and to cover her bosom.  It was very thick and wavy.  Now\nthat the scarlet was washed from her lips for the night, her\neyes shone soft and clear with no relief for their almost\ntragic melancholy.  He was looking at her in profile.  Her\nexpression was stern as well as sad--the soul of a woman who\nhas suffered and has been made strong, if not hard.\n\n\"I got a letter from my lawyers today,\" he began.  \"It was\nabout that marriage.  I'll read.\"\n\nAt the word \"marriage,\" she halted the regular stroke of the\nbrush.  Her eyes gazed into the mirror of the dressing table\nthrough her reflection deep into her life, deep into the\nvistas of memory.  As he unfolded the letter, she leaned back\nin the low chair, let her hands drop to her lap.\n\n\"'As the inclosed documents show,'\" he read, \"'we have learned\nand have legally verified that Jeb--not James--Ferguson\ndivorced his wife Susan Lenox about a year after their\nmarriage, on the ground of desertion; and two years later he\nfell through the floor of an old bridge near Brooksburg and\nwas killed.'\"\n\nThe old bridge--she was feeling its loose flooring sag and\nshift under the cautious hoofs of the horse.  She was seeing\nRod Spenser on the horse, behind him a girl, hardly more than\na child--under the starry sky exchanging confidences--talking\nof their futures.\n\n\"So, you see, you are free,\" said Palmer.  \"I went round to an\nAmerican lawyer's office this afternoon, and borrowed an old\nlegal form book.  And I've copied out this form----\"\n\nShe was hardly conscious of his laying papers on the table\nbefore her.\n\n\"It's valid, as I've fixed things.  The lawyer gave me some\npaper.  It has a watermark five years old.  I've dated back\ntwo years--quite enough.  So when we've signed, the marriage\nnever could be contested--not even by ourselves.\"\n\nHe took the papers from the table, laid them in her lap.  She\nstarted.  \"What were you saying?\" she asked.  \"What's this?\"\n\n\"What were you thinking about?\" said he.\n\n\"I wasn't thinking,\" she answered, with her slow sweet smile\nof self-concealment.  \"I was feeling--living--the past.  I was\nwatching the procession.\"\n\nHe nodded understandingly.  \"That's a kind of time-wasting\nthat can easily be overdone.\"\n\n\"Easily,\" she agreed.  \"Still, there's the lesson.  I have to\nremind myself of it often--always, when there's anything that\nhas to be decided.\"\n\n\"I've written out two of the forms,\" said he.  \"We sign both.\nYou keep one, I the other.  Why not sign now?\"\n\nShe read the form--the agreement to take each other as lawful\nhusband and wife and to regard the contract as in all respects\nbinding and legal.\n\n\"Do you understand it?\" laughed he nervously, for her manner\nwas disquieting.\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"You stared at the paper as if it were a puzzle.\"\n\n\"It is,\" said she.\n\n\"Come into the library and we'll sign and have it over with.\"\n\nShe laid the papers on the dressing table, took up her brush,\ndrew it slowly over her hair several times.\n\n\"Wake up,\" cried he, good humoredly.  \"Come on into the\nlibrary.\"  And he went to the threshold.\n\nShe continued brushing her hair.  \"I can't sign,\" said she.\nThere was the complete absence of emotion that caused her to\nbe misunderstood always by those who did not know her\npeculiarities.  No one could have suspected the vision of the\nold women of the dive before her eyes, the sound of the\nhunchback's piano in her ears, the smell of foul liquors and\nfoul bodies and foul breaths in her nostrils.  Yet she repeated:\n\n\"No--I can't sign.\"\n\nHe returned to his chair, seated himself, a slight cloud on his\nbrow, a wicked smile on his lips.  \"Now what the devil!\" said he\ngently, a jeer in his quiet voice.  \"What's all this about?\"\n\n\"I can't marry you,\" said she.  \"I wish to live on as we are.\"\n\n\"But if we do that we can't get up where we want to go.\"\n\n\"I don't wish to know anyone but interesting men of the sort\nthat does things--and women of my own sort.  Those people have\nno interest in conventionalities.\"\n\n\"That's not the crowd we set out to conquer,\" said he.  \"You\nseem to have forgotten.\"\n\n\"It's you who have forgotten,\" replied she.\n\n\"Yes--yes--I know,\" he hastened to say.  \"I wasn't accusing\nyou of breaking your agreement.  You've lived up to it--and\nmore.  But, Susan, the people you care about don't especially\ninterest me.  Brent--yes.  He's a man of the world as well as\none of the artistic chaps.  But the others--they're beyond me.\nI admit it's all fine, and I'm glad you go in for it.  But the\nonly crowd that's congenial to me is the crowd that we've got\nto be married to get in with.\"\n\nShe saw his point--saw it more clearly than did he.  To him\nthe world of fashion and luxurious amusement seemed the only\nworld worth while.  He accepted the scheme of things as he\nfound it, had the conventional ambitions--to make in\nsuccession the familiar goals of the conventional human\nsuccess--power, wealth, social position.  It was impossible\nfor him to get any other idea of a successful life, of\nambitions worthy a man's labor.  It was evidence of the\nexcellence of his mind that he was able to tolerate the idea\nof the possibility of there being another mode of success\nworth while.\n\n\"I'm helping you in your ambitions--in doing what you think is\nworth while,\" said he.  \"Don't you think you owe it to me to\nhelp me in mine?\"\n\nHe saw the slight change of expression that told him how\ndeeply he had touched her.\n\n\"If I don't go in for the high society game,\" he went on,\n\"I'll have nothing to do.  I'll be adrift--gambling, drinking,\nyawning about and going to pieces.  A man's got to have\nsomething to work for--and he can't work unless it seems to\nhim worth doing.\"\n\nShe was staring into the mirror, her elbows on the table, her\nchin upon her interlaced fingers.  It would be difficult to\nsay how much of his gentleness to her was due to her physical\ncharm for him, and how much to his respect for her mind and\nher character.  He himself would have said that his weakness\nwas altogether the result of the spell her physical charm\ncast over him.  But it is probable that the other element was\nthe stronger.\n\n\"You'll not be selfish, Susan?\" urged he.  \"You'll give me a\nsquare deal.\"\n\n\"Yes--I see that it does look selfish,\" said she.  \"A little\nwhile ago I'd not have been able to see any deeper than the\nlooks of it.  Freddie, there are some things no one has a\nright to ask of another, and no one has a right to grant.\"\n\nThe ugliness of his character was becoming less easy to\ncontrol.  This girl whom he had picked up, practically out of\nthe gutter, and had heaped generosities upon, was trying his\npatience too far.  But he said, rather amiably:\n\n\"Certainly I'm not asking any such thing of you in asking you\nto become a respectable married woman, the wife of a rich man.\"\n\n\"Yes--you are, Freddie,\" replied she gently.  \"If I married\nyou, I'd be signing an agreement to lead your life, to give up\nmy own--an agreement to become a sort of woman I've no desire\nto be and no interest in being; to give up trying to become\nthe only sort of woman I think is worth while.  When we were\ndiscussing my coming with you, you made this same proposal in\nanother form.  I refused it then.  And I refuse it now.  It's\nharder to refuse now, but I'm stronger.\"\n\n\"Stronger, thanks to the money you've got from me--the money\nand the rest of it,\" sneered he.\n\n\"Haven't I earned all I've got?\" said she, so calmly that he\ndid not realize how the charge of ingratitude, unjust though\nit was, had struck into her.\n\n\"You have changed!\" said he.  \"You're getting as hard as the\nrest of us.  So it's all a matter of money, of give and\ntake--is it?  None of the generosity and sentiment you used to\nbe full of?  You've simply been using me.\"\n\n\"It can be put that way,\" replied she.  \"And no doubt you\nhonestly see it that way.  But I've got to see my own interest\nand my own right, Freddie.  I've learned at last that I\nmustn't trust to anyone else to look after them for me.\"\n\n\"Are you riding for a fall--Queenie?\"\n\nAt \"Queenie\" she smiled faintly.  \"I'm riding the way I always\nhave,\" answered she.  \"It has carried me down.  But--it has\nbrought me up again.\"  She looked at him with eyes that\nappealed, without yielding.  \"And I'll ride that way to the\nend--up or down,\" said she.  \"I can't help it.\"\n\n\"Then you want to break with me?\" he asked--and he began to\nlook dangerous.\n\n\"No,\" replied she.  \"I want to go on as we are. . . .  I'll not\nbe interfering in your social ambitions, in any way.  Over\nhere it'll help you to have a mistress who--\" she saw her\nimage in the glass, threw him an arch glance--\"who isn't\naltogether unattractive won't it?  And if you found you could\ngo higher by marrying some woman of the grand world--why,\nyou'd be free to do it.\"\n\nHe had a way of looking at her that gave her--and himself--the\nsense of a delirious embrace.  He looked at her so, now.  He said:\n\n\"You take advantage of my being crazy about you--_damn_ you!\"\n\n\"Heaven knows,\" laughed she, \"I need every advantage I can find.\"\n\nHe touched her--the lightest kind of touch.  It carried the\nsense of embrace in his look still more giddily upward.\n\"Queenie!\" he said softly.\n\nShe smiled at him through half closed eyes that with a gentle\nand shy frankness confessed the secret of his attraction for\nher.  There was, however, more of strength than of passion in\nher face as a whole.  Said she:\n\n\"We're getting on well--as we are aren't we?  I can meet the\nmost amusing and interesting people--my sort of people.  You\ncan go with the people and to the places you like and you'll\nnot be bound.  If you should take a notion to marry some woman\nwith a big position--you'd not have to regret being tied\nto--Queenie.\"\n\n\"But--I want you--I want you,\" said he.  \"I've got to have you.\"\n\n\"As long as you like,\" said she.  \"But on terms I can\naccept--always on terms I can accept.  Never on any\nothers--never!  I can't help it.  I can yield everything\nbut that.\"\n\nWhere she was concerned he was the primitive man only.  The\nhigher his passion rose, the stronger became his desire for\nabsolute possession.  When she spoke of terms--of the\nlimitations upon his possession of her--she transformed his\npassion into fury.  He eyed her wickedly, abruptly demanded:\n\n\"When did you decide to make this kick-up?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  Simply--when you asked me to sign, I found I\ncouldn't.\"\n\n\"You don't expect _me_ to believe that.\"\n\n\"It's the truth.\"  She resumed brushing her hair.\n\n\"Look at me!\"\n\nShe turned her face toward him, met his gaze.\n\n\"Have you fallen in love with that young Jew?\"\n\n\"Gourdain?  No.\"\n\n\"Have you a crazy notion that your looks'll get you a better\nhusband?  A big fortune or a title?\"\n\n\"I haven't thought about a husband.  Haven't I told you I wish\nto be free?\"\n\n\"But that doesn't mean anything.\"\n\n\"It might,\" said she absently.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  If one is always free--one is ready\nfor--whatever comes.  Anyhow, I must be free--no matter what\nit costs.\"\n\n\"I see you're bent on dropping back into the dirt I picked you\nout of.\"\n\n\"Even that,\" she said.  \"I must be free.\"\n\n\"Haven't you any desire to be respectable--decent?\"\n\n\"I guess not,\" confessed she.  \"What is there in that\ndirection for me?\"\n\n\"A woman doesn't stay young and good-looking long.\"\n\n\"No.\"  She smiled faintly.  \"But does she get old and ugly any\nslower for being married?\"\n\nHe rose and stood over her, looked smiling danger down at her.\nShe leaned back in her chair to meet his eyes without\nconstraint.  \"You're trying to play me a trick,\" said he.\n\"But you're not going to get away with the goods.  I'm\nastonished that you are so rotten ungrateful.\"\n\n\"Because I'm not for sale?\"\n\n\"Queenie balking at selling herself,\" he jeered.  \"And what's\nthe least you ever did sell for?\"\n\n\"A half-dollar, I think.  No--two drinks of whiskey one cold\nnight.  But what I sold was no more myself than--than the coat\nI'd pawned and drunk up before I did it.\"\n\nThe plain calm way in which she said this made it so terrible\nthat he winced and turned away.  \"We have seen hell--haven't\nwe?\" he muttered.  He turned toward her with genuine passion\nof feeling.  \"Susan,\" he cried, \"don't be a fool.  Let's push\nour luck, now that things are coming our way.  We need each\nother--we want to stay together--don't we?\"\n\n\"_I_ want to stay.  I'm happy.\"\n\n\"Then--let's put the record straight.\"\n\n\"Let's keep it straight,\" replied she earnestly.  \"Don't ask\nme to go where I don't belong.  For I can't,\nFreddie--honestly, I can't.\"\n\nA pause.  Then, \"You will!\" said he, not in blustering fury,\nbut in that cool and smiling malevolence which had made him\nthe terror of his associates from his boyhood days among the\npetty thieves and pickpockets of Grand Street.  He laid his\nhand gently on her shoulder.  \"You hear me.  I say you will.\"\n\nShe looked straight at him.  \"Not if you kill me,\" she said.\nShe rose to face him at his own height.  \"I've bought my\nfreedom with my body and with my heart and with my soul.  It's\nall I've got.  I shall keep it.\"\n\nHe measured her strength with an expert eye.  He knew that he\nwas beaten.  He laughed lightly and went into his dressing-room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nTHEY met the next morning with no sign in the manner of either\nthat there had been a drawn battle, that there was an armed\ntruce.  She knew that he, like herself, was thinking of\nnothing else.  But until he had devised some way of certainly\nconquering her he would wait, and watch, and pretend that he\nwas satisfied with matters as they were.  The longer she\nreflected the less uneasy she became--as to immediate danger.\nIn Paris the methods of violence he might have been tempted to\ntry in New York were out of the question.  What remained?  He\nmust realize that threats to expose her would be futile; also,\nhe must feel vulnerable, himself, to that kind of attack--a\nfeeling that would act as a restraint, even though he might\nappreciate that she was the sort of person who could not in\nany circumstances resort to it.  He had not upon her a single\none of the holds a husband has upon a wife.  True, he could\nbreak with her.  But she must appreciate how easy it would now\nbe for her in this capital of the idle rich to find some other\nman glad to \"protect\" a woman so expert at gratifying man's\nvanity of being known as the proprietor of a beautiful and\nfashionable woman.  She had discovered how, in the aristocracy\nof European wealth, an admired mistress was as much a\nnecessary part of the grandeur of great nobles, great\nfinanciers, great manufacturers, or merchants, as wife, as\nheir, as palace, as equipage, as chef, as train of secretaries\nand courtiers.  She knew how deeply it would cut, to find\nhimself without his show piece that made him the envied of men\nand the desired of women.  Also, she knew that she had an even\nstronger hold upon him--that she appealed to him as no other\nwoman ever had, that she had become for him a tenacious habit.\nShe was not afraid that he would break with her.  But she\ncould not feel secure; in former days she had seen too far\ninto the mazes of that Italian mind of his, she knew too well\nhow patient, how relentless, how unforgetting he was.  She\nwould have taken murder into account as more than a\npossibility but for his intense and intelligent selfishness;\nhe would not risk his life or his liberty; he would not\ndeprive himself of his keenest pleasure.  He was resourceful;\nbut in the circumstances what resources were there for him to\ndraw upon?\n\nWhen he began to press upon her more money than ever, and to\nbuy her costly jewelry, she felt still further reassured.\nEvidently he had been unable to think out any practicable\nscheme; evidently he was, for the time, taking the course of\nappeal to her generous instincts, of making her more and more\ndependent upon his liberality.\n\nWell--was he not right?  Love might fail; passion might wane;\nconscience, aiding self-interest with its usual servility,\nmight overcome the instincts of gratitude.  But what power\ncould overcome the loyalty resting upon money interest?  No\npower but that of a longer purse than his.  As she was not in\nthe mood to make pretenses about herself to herself, she\nsmiled at this cynical self-measuring.  \"But I shan't despise\nmyself for being so material,\" said she to herself, \"until I\nfind a _genuine_ case of a woman, respectable or otherwise, who\nhas known poverty and escaped from it, and has then\nvoluntarily given up wealth to go back to it.  I should not\nstay on with him if he were distasteful to me.  And that's\nmore than most women can honestly say.  Perhaps even I should\nnot stay on if it were not for a silly, weak feeling of\nobligation--but I can't be sure of that.\"  She had seen too\nmuch of men and women preening upon noble disinterested\nmotives when in fact their real motives were the most\ncalculatingly selfish; she preferred doing herself less than\njustice rather than more.\n\nShe had fifty-five thousand francs on deposit at Munroe's--all\nher very own.  She had almost two hundred thousand francs'\nworth of jewels, which she would be justified in keeping--at\nleast, she hoped she would think so--should there come a break\nwith Freddie.  Yet in spite of this substantial prosperity--or\nwas it because of this prosperity?--she abruptly began again\nto be haunted by the old visions, by warnings of the dangers\nthat beset any human being who has not that paying trade or\nprofession which makes him or her independent--gives him or\nher the only unassailable independence.\n\nThe end with Freddie might be far away.  But end, she saw,\nthere would be the day when he would somehow get her in his\npower and so would drive her to leave him.  For she could not\nagain become a slave.  Extreme youth, utter inexperience, no\nknowledge of real freedom--these had enabled her to endure in\nformer days.  But she was wholly different now.  She could not\nsink back.  Steadily she was growing less and less able to\ntake orders from anyone.  This full-grown passion for freedom,\nthis intolerance of the least restraint--how dangerous, if she\nshould find herself in a position where she would have to put\nup with the caprices of some man or drop down and down!\n\nWhat real, secure support had she?  None.  Her building was\nwithout solid foundations.  Her struggle with Freddie was a\nrevelation and a warning.  There were days when, driving about\nin her luxurious car, she could do nothing but search among\nthe crowds in the streets for the lonely old women in rags,\npicking and peering along the refuse of the cafés--weazened,\nwarped figures swathed in rags, creeping along, mumbling to\nthemselves, lips folded in and in over toothless gums.\n\nOne day Brent saw again the look she often could not keep from\nher face when that vision of the dance hall in the slums was\nhorrifying her.  He said impulsively:\n\n\"What is it?  Tell me--what is it, Susan?\"\n\nIt was the first and the last time he ever called her by her\nonly personal name.  He flushed deeply.  To cover his\nconfusion--and her own--she said in her most frivolous way:\n\n\"I was thinking that if I am ever rich I shall have more pairs\nof shoes and stockings and take care of more orphans than\nanyone else in the world.\"\n\n\"A purpose!  At last a purpose!\" laughed he.  \"Now you will go\nto work.\"\n\nThrough Gourdain she got a French teacher--and her first woman friend.\n\nThe young widow he recommended, a Madame Clélie Délière, was\nthe most attractive woman she had ever known.  She had all the\nbest French characteristics--a good heart, a lively mind, was\nimaginative yet sensible, had good taste in all things.  Like\nmost of the attractive French women, she was not beautiful,\nbut had that which is of far greater importance--charm.  She\nknew not a word of English, and it was perhaps Susan's chief\nincentive toward working hard at French that she could not\nreally be friends with this fascinating person until she\nlearned to speak her language.  Palmer--partly by nature,\npartly through early experience in the polyglot tenement\ndistrict of New York--had more aptitude for language than had\nSusan.  But he had been lazy about acquiring French in a city\nwhere English is spoken almost universally.  With the coming of\nyoung Madame Délière to live in the apartment, he became interested.\n\nIt was not a month after her coming when you might have seen\nat one of the fashionable gay restaurants any evening a party\nof four--Gourdain was the fourth--talking French almost\nvolubly.  Palmer's accent was better than Susan's.  She could\nnot--and felt she never could--get the accent of the\ntrans-Alleghany region out of her voice--and so long as that\nremained she would not speak good French.  \"But don't let that\ntrouble you,\" said Clélie.  \"Your voice is your greatest\ncharm.  It is so honest and so human.  Of the Americans I have\nmet, I have liked only those with that same tone in their voices.\"\n\n\"But _I_ haven't that accent,\" said Freddie with raillery.\n\nMadame Clélie laughed.  \"No--and I do not like you,\" retorted\nshe.  \"No one ever did.  You do not wish to be liked.  You\nwish to be feared.\"  Her lively brown eyes sparkled and the\nbig white teeth in her generous mouth glistened.  \"You wish to\nbe feared--and you _are_ feared, Monsieur Freddie.\"\n\n\"It takes a clever woman to know how to flatter with the\ntruth,\" said he.  \"Everybody always has been afraid of me--and\nis--except, of course, my wife.\"\n\nHe was always talking of \"my wife\" now.  The subject so\ncompletely possessed his mind that he aired it unconsciously.\nWhen she was not around he boasted of \"my wife's\" skill in the\nart of dress, of \"my wife's\" taste, of \"my wife's\" shrewdness\nin getting her money's worth.  When she was there, he was\nusing the favorite phrase \"my wife\" this--\"my wife\" that--\"my\nwife\" the other--until it so got on her nerves that she began\nto wait for it and to wince whenever it came--never a wait of\nmany minutes.  At first she thought he was doing this\ndeliberately either to annoy her or in pursuance of some\nsecret deep design.  But she soon saw that he was not aware of\nhis inability to keep off the subject or of his obsession for\nthat phrase representing the thing he was intensely wishing\nand willing--\"chiefly,\" she thought, \"because it is something\nhe cannot have.\"  She was amazed at his display of such a\nweakness.  It gave her the chance to learn an important truth\nabout human nature--that self-indulgence soon destroys the\nstrongest nature--and she was witness to how rapidly an\ninflexible will disintegrates if incessantly applied to an\nimpossibility.  When a strong arrogant man, unbalanced by long\nand successful self-indulgence, hurls himself at an obstruction,\neither the obstruction yields or the man is destroyed.\n\n\nOne morning early in February, as she was descending from her\nauto in front of the apartment house, she saw Brent in the\ndoorway.  Never had he looked so young or so well.  His color\nwas fine, his face had become almost boyish; upon his skin and\nin his eyes was that gloss of perfect health which until these\nlatter days of scientific hygiene was rarely seen after\ntwenty-five in a woman or after thirty in a man.  She gathered\nin all, to the smallest detail--such as the color of his\nshirt--with a single quick glance.  She knew that he had seen\nher before she saw him--that he had been observing her.  Her\nhappiest friendliest smile made her small face bewitching as\nshe advanced with outstretched hand.\n\n\"When did you come?\" she asked.\n\n\"About an hour ago.\"\n\n\"From the Riviera?\"\n\n\"No, indeed.  From St. Moritz--and skating and skiing and\ntobogganing.  I rather hoped I looked it.  Doing those things\nin that air--it's being born again.\"\n\n\"I felt well till I saw you,\" said she.  \"Now I feel dingy and\nhalf sick.\"\n\nHe laughed, his glance sweeping her from hat to boots.\nCertainly his eyes could not have found a more entrancing\nsight.  She was wearing a beautiful dress of golden brown\ncloth, sable hat, short coat and muff, brown suede boots laced\nhigh upon her long slender calves.  And when she had descended\nfrom the perfect little limousine made to order for her, he\nhad seen a ravishing flutter of lingerie of pale violet silk.\nThe sharp air had brought no color to her cheeks to interfere\nwith the abrupt and fascinating contrast of their pallor with\nthe long crimson bow of her mouth.  But her skin seemed\ntransparent and had the clearness of health itself.  Everything\nabout her, every least detail, was of Parisian perfection.\n\n\"Probably there are not in the world,\" said he, \"so many as a\ndozen women so well put together as you are.  No, not half a\ndozen.  Few women carry the art of dress to the point of genius.\"\n\n\"I see they had only frumps at St. Moritz this season,\"\nlaughed she.\n\nBut he would not be turned aside.  \"Most of the well dressed\nwomen stop short with being simply frivolous in spending so\nmuch time at less than perfection--like the army of poets who\nwrite pretty good verse, or the swarm of singers who sing\npretty well.  I've heard of you many times this winter.  You\nare the talk of Paris.\"\n\nShe laughed with frank delight.  It was indeed a pleasure to\ndiscover that her pains had not been in vain.\n\n\"It is always the outsider who comes to the great city to show\nit its own resources,\" he went on.  \"I knew you were going to\ndo this.  Still happy?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\nBut he had taken her by surprise.  A faint shadow flitted\nacross her face.  \"Not so happy, I see.\"\n\n\"You see too much.  Won't you lunch with us?  We'll have it in\nabout half an hour.\"\n\nHe accepted promptly and they went up together.  His glance\ntraveled round the drawing-room; and she knew he had noted all\nthe changes she had made on better acquaintance with her\nsurroundings and wider knowledge of interior furnishing.  She\nsaw that he approved, and it increased her good humor.  \"Are you\nhurrying through Paris on your way to somewhere else?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, I stop here--I think--until I sail for America.\"\n\n\"And that will be soon?\"\n\n\"Perhaps not until July.  I have no plans.  I've finished a\nplay a woman suggested to me some time ago.  And I'm waiting.\"\n\nA gleam of understanding came into her eyes.  There was\ncontrolled interest in her voice as she inquired:\n\n\"When is it to be produced?\"\n\n\"When the woman who suggested it is ready to act in it.\"\n\n\"Do I by any chance know her?\"\n\n\"You used to know her.  You will know her again.\"\n\nShe shook her head slowly, a pensive smile hovering about her\neyes and lips.  \"No--not again.  I have changed.\"\n\n\"We do not change,\" said he.  \"We move, but we do not change.\nYou are the same character you were when you came into the\nworld.  And what you were then, that you will be when the\ncurtain falls on the climax of your last act.  Your\ncircumstances will change--and your clothes--and your face,\nhair, figure--but not _you_.\"\n\n\"Do you believe that?\"\n\n\"I _know_ it.\"\n\nShe nodded slowly, the violet-gray eyes pensive.  \"Birds in\nthe strong wind--that's what we are.  Driven this way or\nthat--or quite beaten down.  But the wind doesn't change\nsparrow to eagle--or eagle to gull--does it?\"\n\nShe had removed her coat and was seated on an oval lounge\ngazing into the open fire.  He was standing before it, looking\ntaller and stronger than ever, in a gray lounging suit.  A\ncigarette depended loosely from the corner of his mouth.  He\nsaid abruptly:\n\n\"How are you getting on with your acting?\"\n\nShe glanced in surprise.\n\n\"Gourdain,\" Brent explained.  \"He had to talk to somebody\nabout how wonderful you are.  So he took to writing me--two\nhuge letters a week--all about you.\"\n\n\"I'm fond of him.  And he's fond of Clélie.  She's my----\"\n\n\"I know all,\" he interrupted.  \"The tie between them is their\nfondness for you.  Tell me about the acting.\"\n\n\"Oh--Clélie and I have been going to the theater every few\ndays--to help me with French.  She is mad about acting, and\nthere's nothing I like better.\"\n\n\"Also, _you_ simply have to have occupation.\"\n\nShe nodded.  \"I wasn't brought up to fit me for an idler.\nWhen I was a child I was taught to keep busy--not at nothing,\nbut at something.  Freddie's a lot better at it than I.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Brent.  \"You had a home, with order and a\nsystem--an old-fashioned American home.  He--well, he hadn't.\"\n\n\"Clélie and I go at our make-believe acting quite seriously.\nWe have to--if we're to fool ourselves that it's an occupation.\"\n\n\"Why this anxiety to prove to me that you're not really serious?\"\n\nSusan laughed mockingly for answer, and went on:\n\n\"You should see us do the two wives in 'L'Enigme'--or mother\nand daughter in that diary scene in 'L'Autre Danger'!\"\n\n\"I must. . . .  When are you going to resume your career?\"\n\nShe rose, strolled toward an open door at one end of the\nsalon, closed it--strolled toward the door into the hall,\nglanced out, returned without having closed it.  She then said:\n\n\"Could I study here in Paris?\"\n\nTriumph gleamed in his eyes.  \"Yes.  Boudrin--a splendid\nteacher--speaks English.  He--and I--can teach you.\"\n\n\"Tell me what I'd have to do.\"\n\n\"We would coach you for a small part in some play that's to be\nproduced here.\"\n\n\"In French?\"\n\n\"I'll have an American girl written into a farce.  Enough to\nget you used to the stage--to give you practice in what he'll\nteach you--the trade side of the art.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then we shall spend the summer learning your part in my\nplay.  Two or three weeks of company rehearsals in New York in\nSeptember.  In October--your name out over the Long Acre\nTheater in letters of fire.\"\n\n\"Could that be done?\"\n\n\"Even if you had little talent, less intelligence, and no\nexperience.  Properly taught, the trade part of every art is\neasy.  Teachers make it hard partly because they're dull,\nchiefly because there'd be small money for them if they taught\nquickly, and only the essentials.  No, journeyman acting's no\nharder to learn than bricklaying or carpentering.  And in\nAmerica--everywhere in the world but a few theaters in Paris\nand Vienna--there is nothing seen but journeyman acting.  The\nart is in its infancy as an art.  It even has not yet been\nemancipated from the swaddling clothes of declamation.  Yes,\nyou can do well by the autumn.  And if you develop what I\nthink you have in you, you can leap with one bound into fame.\nIn America or England, mind you--because there the acting is\nall poor to 'pretty good'.\"\n\n\"You are sure it could be done?  No--I don't mean that.\nI mean, is there really a chance--any chance--for me to\nmake my own living?  A real living?\"\n\n\"I guarantee,\" said Brent.\n\nShe changed from seriousness to a mocking kind of gayety--that\nis, to a seriousness so profound that she would not show it.\nAnd she said:\n\n\"You see I simply must banish my old women--and that hunchback\nand his piano.  They get on my nerves.\"\n\nHe smiled humorously at her.  But behind the smile his\ngaze--grave, sympathetic--pierced into her soul, seeking the\nmeaning he knew she would never put into words.\n\nAt the sound of voices in the hall she said:\n\n\"We'll talk of this again.\"\n\nAt lunch that day she, for the first time in many a week,\nlistened without irritation while Freddie poured forth his\nunending praise of \"my wife.\"  As Brent knew them intimately,\nFreddie felt free to expatiate upon all the details of\ndomestic economy that chanced to be his theme, with the\nexquisite lunch as a text.  He told Brent how Susan had made\na study of that branch of the art of living; how she had\nexplored the unrivaled Parisian markets and groceries and\nshops that dealt in specialties; how she had developed their\nbreakfasts, dinners, and lunches to works of art.  It is\nimpossible for anyone, however stupid, to stop long in Paris\nwithout beginning to idealize the material side of life--for\nthe French, who build solidly, first idealize food, clothing,\nand shelter, before going on to take up the higher side of\nlife--as a sane man builds his foundation before his first\nstory, and so on, putting the observation tower on last of\nall, instead of making an ass of himself trying to hang his\ntower to the stars.  Our idealization goes forward haltingly\nand hypocritically because we try to build from the stars\ndown, instead of from the ground up.  The place to seek the\nideal is in the homely, the commonplace, and the necessary.\nAn ideal that does not spring deep-rooted from the soil of\npractical life may be a topic for a sermon or a novel or for\nidle conversation among silly and pretentious people.  But\nwhat use has it in a world that must _live_, and must be taught\nto live?\n\nFreddie was unaware that he was describing a further\ndevelopment of Susan--a course she was taking in the\nuniversity of experience--she who had passed through its\ncommon school, its high school, its college.  To him her\nclever housekeeping offered simply another instance of her\ncleverness in general.  His discourse was in bad taste.  But\nits bad taste was tolerable because he was interesting--food,\nlike sex, being one of those universal subjects that command\nand hold the attention of all mankind.  He rose to no mean\nheight of eloquence in describing their dinner of the evening\nbefore--the game soup that brought to him visions of a hunting\nexcursion he had once made into the wilds of Canada; the way\nthe _barbue_ was cooked and served; the incredible duck--and\nthe salad!  Clélie interrupted to describe that salad as like\na breath of summer air from fields and limpid brooks.  He\ndeclared that the cheese--which Susan had found in a shop in\nthe Marche St. Honoré--was more wonderful than the most\nwonderful _petit Suisse_.  \"And the coffee!\" he exclaimed.\n\"But you'll see in a few minutes.  We have _coffee_ here.\"\n\n\"_Quelle histoire!_\" exclaimed Brent, when Freddie had\nconcluded.  And he looked at Susan with the ironic, quizzical\ngleam in his eyes.\n\nShe colored.  \"I am learning to live,\" said she.  \"That's what\nwe're on earth for--isn't it?\"\n\n\"To learn to live--and then, to live,\" replied he.\n\nShe laughed.  \"Ah, that comes a little later.\"\n\n\"Not much later,\" rejoined he, \"or there's no time left for it.\"\n\nIt was Freddie who, after lunch, urged Susan and Clélie to\n\"show Brent what you can do at acting.\"\n\n\"Yes--by all means,\" said Brent with enthusiasm.\n\nAnd they gave--in one end of the salon which was well suited\nfor it--the scene between mother and daughter over the stolen\ndiary, in \"L'Autre Danger.\"  Brent said little when they\nfinished, so little that Palmer was visibly annoyed.  But\nSusan, who was acquainted with his modes of expression, felt\na deep glow of satisfaction.  She had no delusions about her\nattempts; she understood perfectly that they were simply crude\nattempts.  She knew she had done well--for her--and she knew\nhe appreciated her improvement.\n\n\"That would have gone fine--with costumes and scenery--eh?\"\ndemanded Freddie of Brent.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Brent absently.  \"Yes--that is--Yes.\"\n\nFreddie was dissatisfied with this lack of enthusiasm.  He\nwent on insistently:\n\n\"I think she ought to go on the stage--she and Madame Clélie, too.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Brent, between inquiry and reflection.\n\n\"What do _you_ think?\"\n\n\"I don't think she ought,\" replied Brent.  \"I think she\n_must_.\"  He turned to Susan.  \"Would you like it?\"\n\nSusan hesitated.  Freddie said--rather lamely, \"Of course she\nwould.  For my part, I wish she would.\"\n\n\"Then I will,\" said Susan quietly.\n\nPalmer looked astounded.  He had not dreamed she would assent.\nHe knew her tones--knew that the particular tone meant\nfinality.  \"You're joking,\" cried he, with an uneasy laugh.\n\"Why, you wouldn't stand the work for a week.  It's hard\nwork--isn't it, Brent?\"\n\n\"About the hardest,\" said Brent.  \"And she's got practically\neverything still to learn.\"\n\n\"Shall we try, Clélie?\" said Susan.\n\nYoung Madame Délière was pale with eagerness.  \"Ah--but that\nwould be worth while!\" cried she.\n\n\"Then it's settled,\" said Susan.  To Brent:  \"We'll make the\narrangements at once--today.\"\n\nFreddie was looking at her with a dazed expression.  His\nglance presently drifted from her face to the fire, to rest\nthere thoughtfully as he smoked his cigar.  He took no part in\nthe conversation that followed.  Presently he left the room\nwithout excusing himself.  When Clélie seated herself at the\npiano to wander vaguely from one piece of music to another,\nBrent joined Susan at the fire and said in English:\n\n\"Palmer is furious.\"\n\n\"I saw,\" said she.\n\n\"I am afraid.  For--I know him.\"\n\nShe looked calmly at him.  \"But I am not.\"\n\n\"Then you do not know him.\"\n\nThe strangest smile flitted across her face.\n\nAfter a pause Brent said:  \"Are you married to him?\"\n\nAgain the calm steady look.  Then:  \"That is none of your business.\"\n\n\"I thought you were not,\" said Brent, as if she had answered\nhis question with a clear negative.  He added, \"You know I'd\nnot have asked if it had been 'none of my business.'\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"If you had been his wife, I could not have gone on.  I've all\nthe reverence for a home of the man who has never had one.\nI'd not take part in a home-breaking.  But--since you are free----\"\n\n\"I shall never be anything else but free.  It's because I wish\nto make sure of my freedom that I'm going into this.\"\n\nPalmer appeared in the doorway.\n\n\nThat night the four and Gourdain dined together, went to the\ntheater and afterward to supper at the Cafe de Paris.\nGourdain and young Madame Délière formed an interesting,\nunusually attractive exhibit of the parasitism that is as\ninevitable to the rich as fleas to a dog.  Gourdain was a\nsuperior man, Clélie a superior woman.  There was nothing of\nthe sycophant, or even of the courtier, about either.  Yet\nthey already had in their faces that subtle indication of the\ndependent that is found in all professional people who\nhabitually work for and associate with the rich only.  They\nhad no sense of dependence; they were not dependents, for they\ngave more than value received.  Yet so corrupting is the\natmosphere about rich people that Gourdain, who had other rich\nclients, no less than Clélie who got her whole living from\nPalmer, was at a glance in the flea class and not in the dog\nclass.  Brent looked for signs of the same thing in Susan's\nface.  The signs should have been there; but they were not.\n\"Not yet,\" thought he.  \"And never will be now.\"\n\nPalmer's abstraction and constraint were in sharp contrast to\nthe gayety of the others.  Susan drank almost nothing.  Her\nspirits were soaring so high that she did not dare stimulate\nthem with champagne.  The Cafe de Paris is one of the places\nwhere the respectable go to watch _les autres_ and to catch a\nreal gayety by contagion of a gayety that is mechanical and\naltogether as unreal as play-acting.  There is something\nfantastic about the official temples of Venus; the\npleasure-makers are so serious under their masks and the\npleasure-getters so quaintly dazzled and deluded.  That is,\nVenus's temples are like those of so many other religions in\nreverence among men--disbelief and solemn humbuggery at the\naltar; belief that would rather die than be undeceived, in the\npews.  Palmer scarcely took his eyes from Susan's face.  It\namused and pleased her to see how uneasy this made Brent--and\nhow her own laughter and jests aggravated his uneasiness to\nthe point where he was almost showing it.  She glanced round\nthat brilliant room filled with men and women, each of them\ncarrying underneath the placidity of stiff evening shirt or\nthe scantiness of audacious evening gown the most\nfascinating emotions and secrets--love and hate and jealousy,\ncold and monstrous habits and desires, ruin impending or\nstealthily advancing, fortune giddying to a gorgeous climax,\ndisease and shame and fear--yet only signs of love and\nlaughter and lightness of heart visible.  And she wondered\nwhether at any other table there was gathered so curious an\nassemblage of pasts and presents and futures as at the one\nover which Freddie Palmer was presiding somberly. . . .  Then her\nthoughts took another turn.  She fell to noting how each man\nwas accompanied by a woman--a gorgeously dressed woman, a\nwoman revealing, proclaiming, in every line, in every\nmovement, that she was thus elaborately and beautifully\ntoiletted to please man, to appeal to his senses, to gain his\ngracious approval.  It was the world in miniature; it was an\nillustration of the position of woman--of her own position.\nFavorite; pet.  Not the equal of man, but an appetizer, a\ndessert.  She glanced at herself in the glass, mocked her own\nradiant beauty of face and form and dress.  Not really a full\nhuman being; merely a decoration.  No more; and no worse off\nthan most of the women everywhere, the favorites licensed or\nunlicensed of law and religion.  But just as badly off, and\njust as insecure.  Free!  No rest, no full breath until\nfreedom had been won!  At any cost, by straight way or\ndevious--free!\n\n\"Let's go home,\" said she abruptly.  \"I've had enough of this.\"\n\n\nShe was in a dressing gown, all ready for bed and reading,\nwhen Palmer came into her sitting-room.  She was smoking, her\ngaze upon her book.  Her thick dark hair was braided close to\nher small head.  There was delicate lace on her nightgown,\nshowing above the wadded satin collar of the dressing gown.\nHe dropped heavily into a chair.\n\n\"If anyone had told me a year ago that a skirt could make a\ndamn fool of me,\" said he bitterly, \"I'd have laughed in his\nface.  Yet--here I am!  How nicely I did drop into your trap\ntoday--about the acting!\"\n\n\"Trap?\"\n\n\"Oh, I admit I built and baited and set it, myself--ass that I\nwas!  But it was your trap--yours and Brent's, all the\nsame. . . .  A skirt--and not a clean one, at that.\"\n\nShe lowered the book to her lap, took the cigarette from\nbetween her lips, looked at him.  \"Why not be reasonable,\nFreddie?\" said she calmly.  Language had long since lost its\npower to impress her.  \"Why irritate yourself and annoy me\nsimply because I won't let you tyrannize over me?  You know\nyou can't treat me as if I were your property.  I'm not your\nwife, and I don't have to be your mistress.\"\n\n\"Getting ready to break with me eh?\"\n\n\"If I wished to go, I'd tell you--and go.\"\n\n\"You'd give me the shake, would you?--without the slightest\nregard for all I've done for you!\"\n\nShe refused to argue that again.  \"I hope I've outgrown doing\nweak gentle things through cowardice and pretending it's\nthrough goodness of heart.\"\n\n\"You've gotten hard--like stone.\"\n\n\"Like you--somewhat.\"  And after a moment she added, \"Anything\nthat's strong is hard--isn't it?  Can a man or a woman get\nanywhere without being able to be what you call 'hard' and\nwhat I call 'strong'?\"\n\n\"Where do _you_ want to get?\" demanded he.\n\nShe disregarded his question, to finish saying what was in her\nmind--what she was saying rather to give herself a clear look\nat her own thoughts and purposes than to enlighten him about\nthem.  \"I'm not a sheltered woman,\" pursued she.  \"I've got no\none to save me from the consequences of doing nice, sweet,\nwomanly things.\"\n\n\"You've got me,\" said he angrily.\n\n\"But why lean if I'm strong enough to stand alone?  Why weaken\nmyself just to gratify your mania for owning and bossing?  But\nlet me finish what I was saying.  I never got any quarter\nbecause I was a woman.  No woman does, as a matter of fact;\nand in the end, the more she uses her sex to help her shirk,\nthe worse her punishment is.  But in my case----\n\n\"I was brought up to play the weak female, to use my sex as my\nshield.  And that was taken from me and--I needn't tell _you_\nhow I was taught to give and take like a man--no, not like a\nman--for no man ever has to endure what a woman goes through\nif she is thrown on the world.  Still, I'm not whining.  Now\nthat it's all over I'm the better for what I've been through.\nI've learned to use all a man's weapons and in addition I've\ngot a woman's.\"\n\n\"As long as your looks last,\" sneered he.\n\n\"That will be longer than yours,\" said she pleasantly, \"if you\nkeep on with the automobiles and the champagne.  And when my\nlooks are gone, my woman's weapons. . .\n\n\"Why, I'll still have the man's weapons left--shan't\nI?--knowledge, and the ability to use it.\"\n\nHis expression of impotent fury mingled with compelled\nadmiration and respect made his face about as unpleasant to\nlook at as she had ever seen it.  But she liked to look.  His\nconfession of her strength made her feel stronger.  The sense\nof strength was a new sensation with her--new and delicious.\nNor could the feeling that she was being somewhat cruel\nrestrain her from enjoying it.\n\n\"I have never asked quarter,\" she went on.  \"I never shall.\nIf fate gets me down, as it has many a time, why I'll he able\nto take my medicine without weeping or whining.  I've never\nasked pity.  I've never asked charity.  That's why I'm here,\nFreddie--in this apartment, instead of in a filthy tenement\nattic--and in these clothes instead of in rags--and with you\nrespecting me, instead of kicking me toward the gutter.  Isn't\nthat so?\"\n\nHe was silent.\n\n\"Isn't it so?\" she insisted.\n\n\"Yes,\" he admitted.  And his handsome eyes looked the love so\nnear to hate that fills a strong man for a strong woman when\nthey clash and he cannot conquer.  \"No wonder I'm a fool about\nyou,\" he muttered.\n\n\"I don't purpose that any man or woman shall use me,\" she went\non, \"in exchange for merely a few flatteries.  I insist that\nif they use me, they must let me use them.  I shan't be mean\nabout it, but I shan't be altogether a fool, either.  And what\nis a woman but a fool when she lets men use her for nothing\nbut being called sweet and loving and womanly?  Unless that's\nthe best she can do, poor thing!\"\n\n\"You needn't sneer at respectable women.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" replied she.  \"I've no sneers for anybody.  I've\ndiscovered a great truth, Freddie the deep-down equality of\nall human beings--all of them birds in the same wind and\nbattling with it each as best he can.  As for myself--with\nmoney, with a career that interests me, with position that'll\ngive me any acquaintances and friends that are congenial, I\ndon't care what is said of me.\"\n\nAs her plan unfolded itself fully to his understanding, which\nneeded only a hint to enable it to grasp all, he forgot his\nrage for a moment in his interest and admiration.  Said he:\n\n\"You've used me.  Now you're going to use Brent--eh?\nWell--what will you give _him_ in exchange?\"\n\n\"He wants someone to act certain parts in certain plays.\"\n\n\"Is that _all_ he wants?\"\n\n\"He hasn't asked anything else.\"\n\n\"And if he did?\"\n\n\"Don't be absurd.  You know Brent.\"\n\n\"He's not in love with you,\" assented Palmer.  \"He doesn't\nwant you that way.  There's some woman somewhere, I've\nheard--and he doesn't care about anybody but her.\"\n\nHe was speaking in a careless, casual way, watching her out of\nthe corner of his eye.  And she, taken off guard, betrayed in\nher features the secret that was a secret even from herself.\nHe sprang up with a bound, sprang at her, caught her up out of\nher chair, the fingers of one hand clasping her throat.\n\n\"I thought so!\" he hissed.  \"You love him--damn you!  You love\nhim!  You'd better look out, both of you!\"\n\nThere came a knock at the door between her bedroom and that of\nMadame Clélie.  Palmer released her, stood panting, with\nfurious eyes on the door from which the sound had come.  Susan\ncalled, \"It's all right, Clélie, for the present.\"  Then she\nsaid to Palmer, \"I told Clélie to knock if she ever heard\nvoices in this room--or any sound she didn't understand.\"  She\nreseated herself, began to massage her throat where his\nfingers had clutched it.  \"It's fortunate my skin doesn't mar\neasily,\" she went on.  \"What were you saying?\"\n\n\"I know the truth now.  You love Brent.  That's the milk in\nthe cocoanut.\"\n\nShe reflected on this, apparently with perfect tranquillity,\napparently with no memory of his furious threat against her\nand against Brent.  She said:\n\n\"Perhaps I was simply piqued because there's another woman.\"\n\n\"You are jealous.\"\n\n\"I guess I was--a little.\"\n\n\"You admit that you love him, you----\"\n\nHe checked himself on the first hissing breath of the foul\nepithet.  She said tranquilly:\n\n\"Jealousy doesn't mean love.  We're jealous in all sorts of\nways--and of all sorts of things.\"\n\n\"Well--_he_ cares nothing about _you_.\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"And never will.  He'd despise a woman who had been----\"\n\n\"Don't hesitate.  Say it.  I'm used to hearing it,\nFreddie--and to being it.  And not 'had been' but 'is.' I\nstill am, you know.\"\n\n\"You're not!\" he cried.  \"And never were--and never could\nbe--for some unknown reason, God knows why.\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders, lit another cigarette.  He went on:\n\n\"You can't get it out of your head that because he's\ninterested in you he's more or less stuck on you.  That's the\nway with women.  The truth is, he wants you merely to act in\nhis plays.\"\n\n\"And I want that, too.\"\n\n\"You think I'm going to stand quietly by and let this thing go\non--do you?\"\n\nShe showed not the faintest sign of nervousness at this\nrepetition, more carefully veiled, of his threat against\nher--and against Brent.  She chose the only hopeful course;\nshe went at him boldly and directly.  Said she with amused\ncarelessness:\n\n\"Why not?  He doesn't want me.  Even if I love him, I'm not\ngiving him anything you want.\"\n\n\"How do you know what I want?\" cried he, confused by this\nunexpected way of meeting his attack.  \"You think I'm simply\na brute--with no fine instincts or feelings----\"\n\nShe interrupted him with a laugh.  \"Don't be absurd, Freddie,\"\nsaid she.  \"You know perfectly well you and I don't call out the\nfiner feelings in each other.  If either of us wanted that\nsort of thing, we'd have to look elsewhere.\"\n\n\"You mean Brent--eh?\"\n\nShe laughed with convincing derision.  \"What nonsense!\" She\nput her arms round his neck, and her lips close to his.  The\nviolet-gray eyes were half closed, the perfume of the smooth\namber-white skin, of the thick, wavy, dark hair, was in his\nnostrils.  And in a languorous murmur she soothed his\nsubjection to a deep sleep with, \"As long as you give me what\nI want from you, and I give you what you want from me why\nshould we wrangle?\"\n\nAnd with a smile he acquiesced.  She felt that she had ended\nthe frightful danger--to Brent rather than to herself--that\nsuddenly threatened from those wicked eyes of Palmer's.  But\nit might easily come again.  She did not dare relax her\nefforts, for in the succeeding days she saw that he was like\none annoyed by a constant pricking from a pin hidden in the\nclothing and searched for in vain.  He was no longer jealous\nof Brent.  But while he didn't know what was troubling him, he\ndid know that he was uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nIN but one important respect was Brent's original plan\nmodified.  Instead of getting her stage experience in France,\nSusan joined a London company making one of those dreary,\nweary, cheap and trashy tours of the smaller cities of the\nprovinces with half a dozen plays by Jones, Pinero, and Shaw.\n\nClélie stayed in London, toiling at the language, determined\nto be ready to take the small part of French maid in Brent's\nplay in the fall.  Brent and Palmer accompanied Susan; and\nevery day for several hours Brent and the stage manager--his\nreal name was Thomas Boil and his professional name was\nHerbert Streathern--coached the patient but most unhappy Susan\nline by line, word by word, gesture by gesture, in the little\nparts she was playing.  Palmer traveled with them, making a\npretense of interest that ill concealed his boredom and\nirritation.  This for three weeks; then he began to make trips\nto London to amuse himself with the sports, amateur and\nprofessional, with whom he easily made friends--some of them\nmen in a position to be useful to him socially later on.  He\nhad not spoken of those social ambitions of his since Susan\nrefused to go that way with him--but she knew he had them in\nmind as strongly as ever.  He was the sort of man who must\nhave an objective, and what other objective could there be for\nhim who cared for and believed in the conventional ambitions\nand triumphs only--the successes that made the respectable\nworld gape and grovel and envy?\n\n\"You'll not stick at this long,\" he said to Susan.\n\n\"I'm frightfully depressed,\" she admitted.  \"It's\ntiresome--and hard--and so hideously uncomfortable!  And I've\nlost all sense of art or profession.  Acting seems to be\nnothing but a trade, and a poor, cheap one at that.\"\n\nHe was not surprised, but was much encouraged by this candid\naccount of her state of mind.  Said he:\n\n\"It's my private opinion that only your obstinacy keeps you\nfrom giving it up straight off.  Surely you must see it's\nnonsense.  Drop it and come along--and be comfortable and\nhappy.  Why be obstinate?  There's nothing in it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it _is_ obstinacy,\" said she.  \"I like to think it's\nsomething else.\"\n\n\"Drop it.  You want to.  You know you do.\"\n\n\"I want to, but I can't,\" replied she.\n\nHe recognized the tone, the expression of the eyes, the sudden\nshowing of strength through the soft, young contour.  And he desisted.\n\nNever again could there be comfort, much less happiness, until\nshe had tried out her reawakened ambition.  She had given up\nall that had been occupying her since she left America with\nFreddie; she had abandoned herself to a life of toil.\nCertainly nothing could have been more tedious, more\ntormenting to sensitive nerves, than the schooling through\nwhich Brent was putting her.  Its childishness revolted her\nand angered her.  Experience had long since lowered very\nconsiderably the point at which her naturally sweet\ndisposition ceased to be sweet--a process through which every\ngood-tempered person must pass unless he or she is to be\ncrushed and cast aside as a failure.  There were days, many of\nthem, when it took all her good sense, all her fundamental\nfaith in Brent, to restrain her from an outbreak.  Streathern\nregarded Brent as a crank, and had to call into service all\nhis humility as a poor Englishman toward a rich man to keep\nfrom showing his contempt.  And Brent seemed to be--indeed\nwas--testing her forbearance to the uttermost.  He offered not\nthe slightest explanation of his method.  He simply ordered\nher blindly to pursue the course he marked out.  She was\nsorely tempted to ask, to demand, explanations.  But there\nstood out a quality in Brent that made her resolve ooze away,\nas soon as she faced him.  Of one thing she was confident.\nAny lingering suspicions Freddie might have had of Brent's\ninterest in her as a woman, or even of her being interested\nin him as a man, must have been killed beyond resurrection.\nFreddie showed that he would have hated Brent, would have\nburst out against him, for the unhuman, inhuman way he was\ntreating her, had it not been that Brent was so admirably\nserving his design to have her finally and forever disgusted\nand done with the stage.\n\nFinally there came a performance in which the audience--the\ngallery part of it--\"booed\" her--not the play, not the other\nplayers, but her and no other.  Brent came along, apparently\nby accident, as she made her exit.  He halted before her and\nscanned her countenance with those all-seeing eyes of his.\nSaid he:\n\n\"You heard them?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" replied she.\n\n\"That was for you,\" said he and he said it with an absence of\nsympathy that made it brutal.\n\n\"For only me,\" said she--frivolously.\n\n\"You seem not to mind.\"\n\n\"Certainly I mind.  I'm not made of wood or stone.\"\n\n\"Don't you think you'd better give it up?\"\n\nShe looked at him with a steely light from the violet eyes,\na light that had never been there before.\n\n\"Give up?\" said she.  \"Not even if you give me up.  This thing\nhas got to be put through.\"\n\nHe simply nodded.  \"All right,\" he said.  \"It will be.\"\n\n\"That booing--it almost struck me dead.  When it didn't, I for\nthe first time felt sure I was going to win.\"\n\nHe nodded again, gave her one of his quick expressive,\nfleeting glances that somehow made her forget and forgive\neverything and feel fresh and eager to start in again.  He said:\n\n\"When the booing began and you didn't break down and run off the\nstage, I knew that what I hoped and believed about you was true.\"\n\nStreathern joined them.  His large, soft eyes were full of\nsympathetic tears.  He was so moved that he braved Brent.  He\nsaid to Susan:\n\n\"It wasn't your fault, Miss Lenox.  You were doing exactly as\nMr. Brent ordered, when the booing broke out.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Brent.\n\nStreathern regarded him with a certain nervousness and veiled\npity.  Streathern had been brought into contact with many\ngreat men.  He had found them, each and every one, with this\nsame streak of wild folly, this habit of doing things that\nwere to him obviously useless and ridiculous.  It was a\nprofound mystery to him why such men succeeded while he\nhimself who never did such things remained in obscurity.  The\nonly explanation was the abysmal stupidity, ignorance, and\nfolly of the masses of mankind.  What a harbor of refuge that\nreflection has ever been for mediocrity's shattered and\nsinking vanity!  Yet the one indisputable fact about the great\ngeniuses of long ago is that in their own country and age \"the\ncommon people heard them gladly.\"  Streathern could not now\nclose his mouth upon one last appeal on behalf of the clever\nand lovely and so amiable victim of Brent's mania.\n\n\"I say, Mr. Brent,\" pleaded he, \"don't you think--Really now,\nif you'll permit a chap not without experience to say\nso--Don't you think that by drilling her so much and so--so\n_beastly_ minutely--you're making her wooden--machine-like?\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Brent, in a tone that sent Streathern\nscurrying away to a place where he could express himself\nunseen and unheard.\n\nIn her fifth week she began to improve.  She felt at home on\nthe stage; she felt at home in her part, whatever it happened\nto be.  She was giving what could really be called a\nperformance.  Streathern, when he was sure Brent could not\nhear, congratulated her.  \"It's wonderfully plucky of you, my\ndear,\" said he, \"quite amazingly plucky--to get yourself\ntogether and go straight ahead, in spite of what your American\nfriend has been doing to you.\"\n\n\"In spite of it.\"  cried Susan.  \"Why, don't you see that it's\nbecause of what he's been doing?  I felt it, all the time.  I\nsee it now.\"\n\n\"Oh, really--do you think so?\" said Streathern.\n\nHis tone made it a polite and extremely discreet way of\ntelling her he thought she had become as mad as Brent.  She\ndid not try to explain to him why she was improving.  In that\nweek she advanced by long strides, and Brent was radiant.\n\n\"Now we'll teach you scales,\" said he.  \"We'll teach you the\nmechanics of expressing every variety of emotion.  Then we'll\nbe ready to study a strong part.\"\n\nShe had known in the broad from the outset what Brent was\ntrying to accomplish--that he was giving her the trade side of\nthe art, was giving it to her quickly and systematically.  But\nshe did not appreciate how profoundly right he was until she\nwas \"learning scales.\"  Then she understood why most so called\n\"professional\" performances are amateurish, haphazard, without\nany precision.  She was learning to posture, and to utter\nevery emotion so accurately that any spectator would recognize\nit at once.\n\n\"And in time your voice and your body,\" said Brent, \"will\nbecome as much your servants as are Paderewski's ten fingers.\nHe doesn't rely upon any such rot as inspiration.  Nor does\nany master of any art.  A mind can be inspired but not a body.\nIt must be taught.  You must first have a perfect instrument.\nThen, if you are a genius, your genius, having a perfect\ninstrument to work with, will produce perfect results.  To\nignore or to neglect the mechanics of an art is to hamper or\nto kill inspiration.  Geniuses--a few--and they not the\ngreatest--have been too lazy to train their instruments.  But\nanyone who is merely talented dares not take the risk.  And\nyou--we'd better assume--are merely talented.\"\n\nStreathern, who had a deserved reputation as a coach, was\ndisgusted with Brent's degradation of an art.  As openly as he\ndared, he warned Susan against the danger of becoming a mere\nmachine--a puppet, responding stiffly to the pulling of\nstrings.  But Susan had got over her momentary irritation\nagainst Brent, her doubt of his judgment in her particular\ncase.  She ignored Streathern's advice that she should be\nnatural, that she should let her own temperament dictate\nvariations on his cut and dried formulae for expression.  She\ncontinued to do as she was bid.\n\n\"If you are _not_ a natural born actress,\" said Brent, \"at\nleast you will be a good one--so good that most critics will\ncall you great.  And if you _are_ a natural born genius at\nacting, you will soon put color in the cheeks of these dolls\nI'm giving you--and ease into their bodies--and nerves and\nmuscles and blood in place of the strings.\"\n\nIn the seventh week he abruptly took her out of the company\nand up to London to have each day an hour of singing, an hour\nof dancing, and an hour of fencing.  \"You'll ruin her health,\"\nprotested Freddie.  \"You're making her work like a ditch digger.\"\n\nBrent replied, \"If she hasn't the health, she's got to abandon\nthe career.  If she has health, this training will give it\nsteadiness and solidity.  If there's a weakness anywhere,\nit'll show itself and can be remedied.\"\n\nAnd he piled the work on her, dictated her hours of sleep, her\nhours for rest and for walking, her diet--and little he gave\nher to eat.  When he had her thoroughly broken to his regimen,\nhe announced that business compelled his going immediately to\nAmerica.  \"I shall be back in a month,\" said he.\n\n\"I think I'll run over with you,\" said Palmer.  \"Do you mind, Susan?\"\n\n\"Clélie and I shall get on very well,\" she replied.  She would\nbe glad to have both out of the way that she might give her\nwhole mind to the only thing that now interested her.  For the\nfirst time she was experiencing the highest joy that comes to\nmortals, the only joy that endures and grows and defies all the\ncalamities of circumstances--the joy of work congenial and developing.\n\n\"Yes--come along,\" said Brent to Palmer.  \"Here you'll be\ntempting her to break the rules.\"  He added, \"Not that you\nwould succeed.  She understands what it all means, now--and\nnothing could stop her.  That's why I feel free to leave her.\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand,\" said Susan.  She was gazing away into\nspace; at sight of her expression Freddie turned hastily away.\n\nOn a Saturday morning Susan and Clélie, after waiting on the\nplatform at Euston Station until the long, crowded train for\nLiverpool and the _Lusitania_ disappeared, went back to the\nlodgings in Half Moon Street with a sudden sense of the\nvastness of London, of its loneliness and dreariness, of its\nawkward inhospitality to the stranger under its pall of foggy\nsmoke.  Susan was thinking of Brent's last words:\n\nShe had said, \"I'll try to deserve all the pains you've taken,\nMr. Brent.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have done a lot for you,\" he had replied.  \"I've put\nyou beyond the reach of any of the calamities of life--beyond\nthe need of any of its consolations.  Don't forget that if the\nsteamer goes down with all on board.\"\n\nAnd then she had looked at him--and as Freddie's back was half\nturned, she hoped he had not seen--in fact, she was sure he\nhad not, or she would not have dared.  And Brent--had returned\nher look with his usual quizzical smile; but she had learned\nhow to see through that mask.  Then--she had submitted to\nFreddie's energetic embrace--had given her hand to\nBrent--\"Good-by,\" she had said; and \"Good luck,\" he.\n\nBeyond the reach of _any_ of the calamities?  Beyond the need\nof _any_ of the consolations?  Yes--it was almost literally\ntrue.  She felt the big interest--the career--growing up\nwithin her, and expanding, and already overstepping all other\ninterests and emotions.\n\nBrent had left her and Clélie more to do than could be done;\nthus they had no time to bother either about the absent or\nabout themselves.  Looking back in after years on the days\nthat Freddie was away, Susan could recall that from time to\ntime she would find her mind wandering, as if groping in the\ndarkness of its own cellars or closets for a lost thought, a\nmissing link in some chain of thought.  This even awakened her\nseveral times in the night--made her leap from sleep into\nacute and painful consciousness as if she had recalled and\ninstantly forgotten some startling and terrible thing.\n\nAnd when Freddie unexpectedly came--having taken passage on the\n_Lusitania_ for the return voyage, after only six nights and\nfive days in New York--she was astonished by her delight at\nseeing him, and by the kind of delight it was.  For it rather\nseemed a sort of relief, as from a heavy burden of anxiety.\n\n\"Why didn't you wait and come with Brent?\" asked she.\n\n\"Couldn't stand it,\" replied he.  \"I've grown clear away from\nNew York--at least from the only New York I know.  I don't\nlike the boys any more.  They bore me.  They--offend me.  And\nI know if I stayed on a few days they'd begin to suspect.  No,\nit isn't Europe.  It's--you.  You're responsible for the\nchange in me.\"\n\nHe was speaking entirely of the internal change, which indeed\nwas great.  For while he was still fond of all kinds of\nsporting, it was not in his former crude way; he had even\nbecome something of a connoisseur of pictures and was\ncultivating a respect for the purity of the English language\nthat made him wince at Susan's and Brent's slang.  But when he\nspoke thus frankly and feelingly of the change in him, Susan\nlooked at him--and, not having seen him in two weeks and three\ndays, she really saw him for the first time in many a month.\nShe could not think of the internal change he spoke of for\nnoting the external change.  He had grown at least fifty\npounds heavier than he had been when they came abroad.  In one\nway this was an improvement; it gave him a dignity, an air of\nconsequence in place of the boyish good looks of the days\nbefore the automobile and before the effects of high living\nbegan to show.  But it made of him a different man in Susan's\neyes--a man who now seemed almost a stranger to her.\n\n\"Yes, you _have_ changed,\" replied she absently.  And she went\nand examined herself in a mirror.\n\n\"You, too,\" said Freddie.  \"You don't look older--as I do.\nBut--there's a--a--I can't describe it.\"\n\nSusan could not see it.  \"I'm just the same,\" she insisted.\n\nPalmer laughed.  \"You can't judge about yourself.  But all\nthis excitement--and studying--and thinking--and God knows\nwhat----  You're not at all the woman I came abroad with.\"\n\nThe subject seemed to be making both uncomfortable; they\ndropped it.\n\nWomen are bred to attach enormous importance to their physical\nselves--so much so that many women have no other sense of\nself-respect, and regard themselves as possessing the entirety\nof virtue if they have chastity or can pretend to have it.\nThe life Susan had led upsets all this and forces a woman\neither utterly to despise herself, even as she is despised of\nmen, or to discard the sex measure of feminine self-respect as\nridiculously inadequate, and to seek some other measure.\nSusan had sought this other measure, and had found it.  She\nwas, therefore, not a little surprised to find--after Freddie\nhad been back three or four days--that he was arousing in her\nthe same sensations which a strange man intimately about would\nhave aroused in her in the long past girlhood of innocence.\nIt was not physical repulsion; it was not a sense of\nimmorality.  It was a kind of shyness, a feeling of violated\nmodesty.  She felt herself blushing if he came into the room\nwhen she was dressing.  As soon as she awakened in the morning\nshe sprang from bed beside him and hastened into her\ndressing-room and closed the door, resisting an impulse to\nlock it.  Apparently the feeling of physical modesty which she\nhad thought dead, killed to the last root, was not dead, was\nonce more stirring toward life.\n\n\"What are you blushing about?\" asked he, when she, passing\nthrough the bedroom, came suddenly upon him, very scantily dressed.\n\nShe laughed confusedly and beat a hurried retreat.  She began\nto revolve the idea of separate bedrooms; she resolved that\nwhen they moved again she would arrange it on some\npretext--and she was looking about for a new place on the plea\nthat their quarters in Half Moon Street were too cramped.  All\nthis close upon his return, for it was before the end of the\nfirst week that she, taking a shower bath one morning, saw the\ndoor of the bathroom opening to admit him, and cried out sharply:\n\n\"Close that door!\"\n\n\"It's I,\" Freddie called, to make himself heard above the\nnoise of the water.  \"Shut off that water and listen.\"\n\nShe shut off the water, but instead of listening, she said,\nnervous but determined:\n\n\"Please close the door.  I'll be out directly.\"\n\n\"Listen, I tell you,\" he cried, and she now noticed that his\nvoice was curiously, arrestingly, shrill.\n\n\"Brent--has been hurt--badly hurt.\"  She was dripping wet.\nShe thrust her arms into her bathrobe, flung wide the partly\nopen door.  He was standing there, a newspaper in his\ntrembling hand.  \"This is a dispatch from New York--dated\nyesterday,\" he began.  \"Listen,\" and he read:\n\n\n\"During an attempt to rob the house of Mr. Robert Brent, the\ndistinguished playwright, early this morning, Mr. Brent was\nset upon and stabbed in a dozen places, his butler, James\nFourget, was wounded, perhaps mortally, and his secretary, Mr.\nJ. C. Garvey, was knocked insensible.  The thieves made their\nescape.  The police have several clues.  Mr. Brent is hovering\nbetween life and death, with the chances against him.\"\n\n\nSusan, leaning with all her weight against the door jamb, saw\nPalmer's white face going away from her, heard his agitated\nvoice less and less distinctly--fell to the floor with a crash\nand knew no more.\n\nWhen she came to, she was lying in the bed; about it or near\nit were Palmer, her maid, his valet, Clélie, several\nstrangers.  Her glance turned to Freddie's face and she looked\ninto his eyes amid a profound silence.  She saw in those eyes\nonly intense anxiety and intense affection.  He said:\n\n\"What is it, dear?  You are all right.  Only a fainting spell.\"\n\n\"Was that true?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, but he'll pull through.  The surgeons save everybody\nnowadays.  I've cabled his secretary, Garvey, and to my\nlawyers.  We'll have an answer soon.  I've sent out for all\nthe papers.\"\n\n\"She must not be agitated,\" interposed a medical looking man\nwith stupid brown eyes and a thin brown beard sparsely veiling\nhis gaunt and pasty face.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Palmer, curtly.  \"My wife is not an invalid.\nOur closest friend has been almost killed.  To keep the news\nfrom her would be to make her sick.\"\n\nSusan closed her eyes.  \"Thank you,\" she murmured.  \"Send them\nall away--except Clélie. . . .  Leave me alone with Clélie.\"\n\nPushing the others before him, Freddie moved toward the door\ninto the hall.  At the threshold he paused to say:\n\n\"Shall I bring the papers when they come?\"\n\nShe hesitated.  \"No,\" she answered without opening her eyes.\n\"Send them in.  I want to read them, myself.\"\n\nShe lay quiet, Clélie stroking her brow.  From time to time a\nshudder passed over her.  When, in answer to a knock, Clélie\ntook in the bundle of newspapers, she sat up in bed and read\nthe meager dispatches.  The long accounts were made long by\nthe addition of facts about Brent's life.  The short accounts\nadded nothing to what she already knew.  When she had read\nall, she sank back among the pillows and closed her eyes.  A\nlong, long silence in the room.  Then a soft knock at the\ndoor.  Clélie left the bedside to answer it, returned to say:\n\n\"Mr. Freddie wishes to come in with a telegram.\"\n\nSusan started up wildly.  Her eyes were wide and staring--a\nlook of horror.  \"No--no!\" she cried.  Then she compressed her\nlips, passed her hand slowly over her brow.  \"Yes--tell him to\ncome in.\"\n\nHer gaze was upon the door until it opened, leaped to his\nface, to his eyes, the instant he appeared.  He was\nsmiling--hopefully, but not gayly.\n\n\"Garvey says\"--and he read from a slip of paper in his hand--\"\n'None of the wounds necessarily mortal.  Doctors refuse to\ncommit themselves, but I believe he has a good chance.'\"\n\nHe extended the cablegram that she might read for herself, and\nsaid, \"He'll win, my dear.  He has luck, and lucky people\nalways win in big things.\"\n\nHer gaze did not leave his face.  One would have said that she\nhad not heard, that she was still seeking what she had admitted\nhim to learn.  He sat down where Clélie had been, and said:\n\n\"There's only one thing for us to do, and that is to go over\nat once.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes.  A baffled, puzzled expression was upon\nher deathly pale face.\n\n\"We can sail on the _Mauretania_ Saturday,\" continued he.\n\"I've telephoned and there are good rooms.\"\n\nShe turned her face away.\n\n\"Don't you feel equal to going?\"\n\n\"As you say, we must.\"\n\n\"The trip can't do you any harm.\"  His forced composure\nabruptly vanished and he cried out hysterically:  \"Good God!\nIt's incredible.\"  Then he got himself in hand again, and went\non:  \"No wonder it bowled you out.  I had my anxiety about you\nto break the shock.  But you----  How do you feel now?\"\n\n\"I'm going to dress.\"\n\n\"I'll send you in some brandy.\"  He bent and kissed her.  A\nshudder convulsed her--a shudder visible even through the\ncovers.  But he seemed not to note it, and went on:  \"I didn't\nrealize how fond I was of Brent until I saw that thing in the\npaper.  I almost fainted, myself.  I gave Clélie a horrible scare.\"\n\n\"I thought you were having an attack,\" said Clélie.  \"My\nhusband looked exactly as you did when he died that way.\"\n\nSusan's strange eyes were gazing intently at him--the\nsearching, baffled, persistently seeking look.  She closed\nthem as he turned from the bed.  When she and Clélie were\nalone and she was dressing, she said:\n\n\"Freddie gave you a scare?\"\n\n\"I was at breakfast,\" replied Clélie, \"was pouring my coffee.\nHe came into the room in his bathrobe--took up the papers from\nthe table opened to the foreign news as he always does.  I\nhappened to be looking at him\"--Clélie flushed--\"he is very\nhandsome in that robe--and all at once he dropped the\npaper--grew white--staggered and fell into a chair.  Exactly\nlike my husband.\"\n\nSusan, seated at her dressing-table, was staring absently out\nof the window.  She shook her head impatiently, drew a long\nbreath, went on with her toilet.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nA FEW minutes before the dinner hour she came into the drawing\nroom.  Palmer and Madame Délière were already there, near\nthe fire which the unseasonable but by no means unusual\ncoolness of the London summer evening made extremely\ncomfortable--and, for Americans, necessary.  Palmer stood with\nhis back to the blaze, moodily smoking a cigarette.  That\nevening his now almost huge form looked more degenerated than\nusual by the fat of high living and much automobiling.  His\nfleshy face, handsome still and of a refined type, bore the\ntraces of anxious sorrow.  Clélie, sitting at the corner of\nthe fireplace and absently turning the leaves of an\nillustrated French magazine, had in her own way an air as\nfunereal as Freddie's.  As Susan entered, they glanced at her.\n\nPalmer uttered and half suppressed an ejaculation of\namazement.  Susan was dressed as for opera or ball--one of her\nbest evening dresses, the greatest care in arranging her hair\nand the details of her toilette.  Never had she been more\nbeautiful.  Her mode of life since she came abroad with\nPalmer, the thoughts that had been filling her brain and\ngiving direction to her life since she accepted Brent as her\nguide and Brent's plans as her career, had combined to give\nher air of distinction the touch of the extraordinary--the\ntouch that characterizes the comparatively few human beings\nwho live the life above and apart from that of the common\nrun--the life illuminated by imagination.  At a glance one\nsees that they are not of the eaters, drinkers, sleepers, and\nseekers after the shallow easy pleasures money provides\nready-made.  They shine by their own light; the rest of mankind\nshines either by light reflected from them or not at all.\n\nLooking at her that evening as she came into the comfortable,\nold-fashioned English room, with its somewhat heavy but\nundeniably dignified furniture and draperies, the least\nobservant could not have said that she was in gala attire\nbecause she was in gala mood.  Beneath the calm of her surface\nexpression lay something widely different.  Her face, slim\nand therefore almost beyond the reach of the attacks of time\nand worry, was of the type to which a haggard expression is\nbecoming.  Her eyes, large and dreamy, seemed to be seeing\nvisions of unutterable sadness, and the scarlet streak of her\nmouth seemed to emphasize their pathos.  She looked young,\nvery young; yet there was also upon her features the stamp of\nexperience, the experience of suffering.  She did not notice\nthe two by the fire, but went to the piano at the far end of the\nroom and stood gazing out into the lovely twilight of the garden.\n\nFreddie, who saw only the costume, said in an undertone to\nClélie, \"What sort of freak is this?\"\n\nSaid Madame Délière:  \"An uncle of mine lost his wife.  They\nwere young and he loved her to distraction.  Between her death\nand the funeral he scandalized everybody by talking\nincessantly of the most trivial details--the cards, the\nmourning, the flowers, his own clothes.  But the night of the\nfuneral he killed himself.\"\n\nPalmer winced as if Clélie had struck him.  Then an expression\nof terror, of fear, came into his eyes.  \"You don't think\nshe'd do that?\" he muttered hoarsely.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" replied the young Frenchwoman.  \"I was simply\ntrying to explain her.  She dressed because she was\nunconscious of what she was doing.  Real sorrow doesn't think\nabout appearances.\"  Then with quick tact she added:  \"Why\nshould she kill herself?  Monsieur Brent is getting well.\nAlso, while she's a devoted friend of his, she doesn't love\nhim, but you.\"\n\n\"I'm all upset,\" said Palmer, in confused apology.\n\nHe gazed fixedly at Susan--a straight, slim figure with the\ncarriage and the poise of head that indicate self-confidence\nand pride.  As he gazed Madame Clélie watched him with\nfascinated eyes.  It was both thrilling and terrifying to see\nsuch love as he was revealing--a love more dangerous than\nhate.  Palmer noted that he was observed, abruptly turned to\nface the fire.\n\nA servant opened the doors into the dining-room, Madame\nDélière rose.  \"Come, Susan,\" said she.\n\nSusan looked at her with unseeing eyes.\n\n\"Dinner is served.\"\n\n\"I do not care for dinner,\" said Susan, seating herself at the piano.\n\n\"Oh, but you----\"\n\n\"Let her alone,\" said Freddie, curtly.  \"You and I will go in.\"\n\nSusan, alone, dropped listless hands into her lap.  How long\nshe sat there motionless and with mind a blank she did not\nknow.  She was aroused by a sound in the hall--in the\ndirection of the outer door of their apartment.  She started\nup, instantly all alive and alert, and glided swiftly in the\ndirection of the sound.  A servant met her at the threshold.\nHe had a cablegram on a tray.\n\n\"For Mr. Palmer,\" said he.\n\nBut she, not hearing, took the envelope and tore it open.  At\na sweep her eyes took in the unevenly typewritten words:\n\n\n\nBrent died at half past two this afternoon.\n                                                  GARVEY.\n\n\nShe gazed wonderingly at the servant, reread the cablegram.\nThe servant said:  \"Shall I take it to Mr. Palmer, ma'am?\"\n\n\"No.  That is all, thanks,\" replied she.\n\nAnd she walked slowly across the room to the fire.  She\nshivered, adjusted one of the shoulder straps of her low-cut\npale green dress.  She read the cablegram a third time, laid\nit gently, thoughtfully, upon the mantel.  \"Brent died at half\npast two this afternoon.\"  Died.  Yes, there was no mistaking\nthe meaning of those words.  She knew that the message was\ntrue.  But she did not feel it.  She was seeing Brent as he\nhad been when they said good-by.  And it would take something\nmore than a mere message to make her feel that the Brent so\nvividly alive, so redolent of life, of activity, of energy, of\nplans and projects, the Brent of health and strength, had\nceased to be.  \"Brent died at half past two this afternoon.\"\nExcept in the great crises we all act with a certain\ntheatricalism, do the thing books and plays and the example of\nothers have taught us to do.  But in the great crises we do as\nwe feel.  Susan knew that Brent was dead.  If he had meant\nless to her, she would have shrieked or fainted or burst into\nwild sobs.  But not when he was her whole future.  She _knew_\nhe was dead, but she did not _believe_ it.  So she stood\nstaring at the flames, and wondering why, when she knew such\na frightful thing, she should remain calm.  When she had heard\nthat he was injured, she had felt, now she did not feel at\nall.  Her body, her brain, went serenely on in their routine.\nThe part of her that was her very self--had it died, and not Brent?\n\nShe turned her back to the fire, gazed toward the opposite\nwall.  In a mirror there she saw the reflection of Palmer, at\ntable in the adjoining room.  A servant was holding a dish at\nhis left and he was helping himself.  She observed his every\nmotion, observed his fattened body, his round and large face,\nthe forming roll of fat at the back of his neck.  All at once\nshe grew cold--cold as she had not been since the night she\nand Etta Brashear walked the streets of Cincinnati.  The ache\nof this cold, like the cold of death, was an agony.  She shook\nfrom head to foot.  She turned toward the mantel again, looked\nat the cablegram.  But she did not take it in her hands.  She\ncould see--in the air, before her eyes--in clear, sharp\nlettering--\"Brent died at half past two this afternoon.  Garvey.\"\n\nThe sensation of cold faded into a sensation of approaching\nnumbness.  She went into the hall--to her own rooms.  In the\ndressing-room her maid, Clemence, was putting away the afternoon\nthings she had taken off.  She stood at the dressing table,\nunclasping the string of pearls.  She said to Clemence tranquilly:\n\n\"Please pack in the small trunk with the broad stripes three\nof my plainest street dresses--some underclothes--the things\nfor a journey--only necessaries.  Some very warm things,\nplease, Clemence, I've suffered from cold, and I can't bear\nthe idea of it.  And please telephone to the--to the Cecil for\na room and bath.  When you have finished I shall pay you what\nI owe and a month's wages extra.  I cannot afford to keep you\nany longer.\"\n\n\"But, madame\"--Clemence fluttered in agitation--\"Madame\npromised to take me to America.\"\n\n\"Telephone for the rooms for Miss Susan Lenox,\" said Susan.\nShe was rapidly taking off her dress.  \"If I took you to\nAmerica I should have to let you go as soon as we landed.\"\n\n\"But, madame--\" Clemence advanced to assist her.\n\n\"Please pack the trunk,\" said Susan.  \"I am leaving here at once.\"\n\n\"I prefer to go to America, even if madame----\"\n\n\"Very well.  I'll take you.  But you understand?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, madame----\"\n\nA sound of hurrying footsteps and Palmer was at the threshold.\nHis eyes were wild, his face distorted.  His hair, usually\ncarefully arranged over the rapidly growing bald spot above\nhis brow, was disarranged in a manner that would have been\nludicrous but for the terrible expression of his face.  \"Go!\"\nhe said harshly to the maid; and he stood fretting the knob\nuntil she hastened out and gave him the chance to close the\ndoor.  Susan, calm and apparently unconscious of his presence,\nwent on with her rapid change of costume.  He lit a cigarette\nwith fingers trembling, dropped heavily into a chair near the\ndoor.  She, seated on the floor, was putting on boots.\n\nWhen she had finished one and was beginning on the other he\nsaid stolidly:\n\n\"You think I did it\"--not a question but an assertion.\n\n\"I know it,\" replied she.  She was so seated that he was\nseeing her in profile.\n\n\"Yes--I did,\" he went on.  He settled himself more deeply in\nthe chair, crossed his leg.  \"And I am glad that I did.\"\n\nShe kept on at lacing the boot.  There was nothing in her\nexpression to indicate emotion, or even that she heard.\n\n\"I did it,\" continued he, \"because I had the right.  He\ninvited it.  He knew me--knew what to expect.  I suppose he\ndecided that you were worth taking the risk.  It's strange\nwhat fools men--all men--we men--are about women. . . .\nYes, he knew it.  He didn't blame me.\"\n\nShe stopped lacing the boot, turned so that she could look at him.\n\n\"Do you remember his talking about me one day?\" he went on,\nmeeting her gaze naturally.  \"He said I was a survival of the\nMiddle Ages--had a medieval Italian mind--said I would do\nanything to gain my end--and would have a clear conscience\nabout it.  Do you remember?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But you don't see why I had the right to kill him?\"\n\nA shiver passed over her.  She turned away again, began again\nto lace the boot--but now her fingers were uncertain.\n\n\"I'll explain,\" pursued he.  \"You and I were getting along\nfine.  He had had his chance with you and had lost it.\nWell, he comes over here--looks us up--puts himself between\nyou and me--proceeds to take you away from me.  Not in a\nsquare manly way but under the pretense of giving you a career.\nHe made you restless--dissatisfied.  He got you away from me.\nIsn't that so?\"\n\nShe was sitting motionless now.\n\nPalmer went on in the same harsh, jerky way:\n\n\"Now, nobody in the world--not even you--knew me better than\nBrent did.  He knew what to expect--if I caught on to what was\ndoing.  And I guess he knew I would be pretty sure to catch on.\"\n\n\"He never said a word to me that you couldn't have heard,\"\nsaid Susan.\n\n\"Of course not,\" retorted Palmer.  \"That isn't the question.\nIt don't matter whether he wanted you for himself or for his\nplays.  The point is that he took you away from me--he, my\nfriend--and did it by stealth.  You can't deny that.\"\n\n\"He offered me a chance for a career--that was all,\" said she.\n\"He never asked for my love--or showed any interest in it.  I\ngave him that.\"\n\nHe laughed--his old-time, gentle, sweet, wicked laugh.  He said:\n\n\"Well--it'd have been better for him if you hadn't.  All it\ndid for him was to cost him his life.\"\n\nUp she sprang.  \"Don't say that!\" she cried passionately--so\npassionately that her whole body shook.  \"Do you suppose I\ndon't know it?  I know that I killed him.  But I don't feel\nthat he's dead.  If I did, I'd not be able to live.  But I\ncan't!  I can't!  For me he is as much alive as ever.\"\n\n\"Try to think that--if it pleases you,\" sneered Palmer.  \"The\nfact remains that it was _you_ who killed him.\"\n\nAgain she shivered.  \"Yes,\" she said, \"I killed him.\"\n\n\"And that's why I hate you,\" Palmer went on, calm and\ndeliberate--except his eyes; they were terrible.  \"A few\nminutes ago--when I was exulting that he would probably\ndie--just then I found that opened cable on the mantel.  Do\nyou know what it did to me?  It made me hate you.  When I read\nit----\"  Freddie puffed at his cigarette in silence.  She\ndropped weakly to the chair at the dressing table.\n\n\"Curse it!\" he burst out.  \"I loved him.  Yes, I was crazy\nabout him--and am still.  I'm glad I killed him.  I'd do it\nagain.  I had to do it.  He owed me his life.  But that\ndoesn't make me forgive _you_.\"\n\nA long silence.  Her fingers wandered among the articles\nspread upon the dressing table.  He said:\n\n\"You're getting ready to leave?\"\n\n\"I'm going to a hotel at once.\"\n\n\"Well, you needn't.  I'm leaving.  You're done with me.  But\nI'm done with you.\"  He rose, bent upon her his wicked glance,\nsneering and cruel.  \"You never want to see me again.  No more\ndo I ever want to see you again.  I wish to God I never had\nseen you.  You cost me the only friend I ever had that I cared\nabout.  And what's a woman beside a friend--a _man_ friend?\nYou've made a fool of me, as a woman always does of a\nman--always, by God!  If she loves him, she destroys him.  If\nshe doesn't love him, he destroys himself.\"\n\nSusan covered her face with her bare arms and sank down at the\ndressing table.  \"For pity's sake,\" she cried brokenly, \"spare\nme--spare me!\"\n\nHe seized her roughly by the shoulder.  \"Just flesh!\" he said.\n\"Beautiful flesh--but just female.  And look what a fool\nyou've made of me--and the best man in the world dead--over\nyonder!  Spare you?  Oh, you'll pull through all right.\nYou'll pull through everything and anything--and come out\nstronger and better looking and better off.  Spare you!  Hell!\nI'd have killed you instead of him if I'd known I was going to\nhate you after I'd done the other thing.  I'd do it yet--you\ndirty skirt!\"\n\nHe jerked her unresisting form to its feet, gazed at her\nlike an insane fiend.  With a sob he seized her in his arms,\ncrushed her against his breast, sunk his fingers deep into her\nhair, kissed it, grinding his teeth as he kissed.  \"I hate\nyou, damn you--and I love you!\"  He flung her back into the\nchair--out of his life.  \"You'll never see me again!\" And he\nfled from the room--from the house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nTHE big ship issued from the Mersey into ugly waters--into the\nweather that at all seasons haunts and curses the coasts of\nNorthern Europe.  From Saturday until Wednesday Susan and\nMadame Délière had true Atlantic seas and skies; and the ship\nleaped and shivered and crashed along like a brave cavalryman\nin the rear of a rout--fighting and flying, flying and\nfighting.  Four days of hours whose every waking second lagged\nto record itself in a distinct pang of physical wretchedness;\nfour days in which all emotions not physical were suspended,\nin which even the will to live, most tenacious of primal\ninstincts in a sane human being, yielded somewhat to the\ngeneral lassitude and disgust.  Yet for Susan Lenox four most\nfortunate days; for in them she underwent a mental change that\nenabled her to emerge delivered of the strain that threatened\nat every moment to cause a snap.\n\nOn the fifth day her mind, crutched by her resuming body, took\nup again its normal routine.  She began to dress herself, to\neat, to exercise--the mechanical things first, as always--then\nto think.  The grief that had numbed her seemed to have been\nleft behind in England where it had suddenly struck her\ndown--England far away and vague across those immense and\ninfuriated waters, like the gulf of death between two\nincarnations.  No doubt that grief was awaiting her at the\nother shores; no doubt there she would feel that Brent was\ngone.  But she would be better able to bear the discovery.\nThe body can be accustomed to the deadliest poisons, so that\nthey become harmless--even useful--even a necessary aid to\nlife.  In the same way the mind can grow accustomed to the\ncruelest calamities, tolerate them, use them to attain a\nstrength and power the hot-housed soul never gets.\n\nWhen a human being is abruptly plunged into an unnatural\nunconsciousness by mental or physical catastrophes, the\ngreatest care is taken that the awakening to normal life again\nbe slow, gradual, without shock.  Otherwise the return would\nmean death or insanity or lifelong affliction with radical\nweakness.  It may be that this sea voyage with its four days\nof agitations that lowered Susan's physical life to a harmony\nof wretchedness with her mental plight, and the succeeding\ndays of gradual calming and restoration, acted upon her to\nsave her from disaster.  There will be those readers of her\nstory who, judging her, perhaps, by themselves--as revealed in\ntheir judgments, rather than in their professions--will think\nit was quite unnecessary to awaken her gradually; they will\ndeclare her a hard-hearted person, caring deeply about no one\nbut herself, or one of those curiosities of human nature that\nare interested only in things, not at all in persons, even in\nthemselves.  There may also be those who will see in her a\nsoft and gentle heart for which her intelligence finally\ntaught her to construct a shield--more or less\neffective--against buffetings which would have destroyed or,\nworse still, maimed her.  These will feel that the sea voyage, the\nsea change, suspending the normal human life, the life on land,\ntided her over a crisis that otherwise must have been disastrous.\n\nHowever this may be--and who dares claim the definite\nknowledge of the mazes of human character and motive to be\npositive about the matter?--however it may be, on Thursday\nafternoon they steamed along a tranquil and glistening sea\ninto the splendor and majesty of New York Harbor.  And Susan\nwas again her calm, sweet self, as the violet-gray eyes gazing\npensively from the small, strongly-featured face plainly\nshowed.  Herself again, with the wound--deepest if not\ncruelest of her many wounds--covered and with its poison under\ncontrol.  She was ready again to begin to live--ready to\nfulfill our only certain mission on this earth, for we are not\nhere to succumb and to die, but to adapt ourselves and live.\nAnd those who laud the succumbers and the diers--yea, even\nthe blessed martyrs of sundry and divers fleeting issues\nusually delusions--may be paying ill-deserved tribute to\nvanity, obstinacy, lack of useful common sense, passion for\nfutile and untimely agitation--or sheer cowardice.  Truth--and\nwhat is truth but right living?--truth needs no martyrs; and\nthe world needs not martyrs, not corpses rotting in unmarked\nor monumented graves, but intelligent men and women, healthy\nin body and mind, capable of leading the human race as fast as\nit is able to go in the direction of the best truth to which\nit is able at that time to aspire.\n\nAs the ship cleared Quarantine Susan stood on the main deck\nwell forward, with Madame Clélie beside her.  And up within\nher, defying all rebuke, surged the hope that cannot die in\nstrong souls living in healthy bodies.\n\nShe had a momentary sense of shame, born of the feeling that\nit is basest, most heartless selfishness to live, to respond\nto the caress of keen air upon healthy skin, of glorious light\nupon healthy eyes, when there are others shut out and shut\naway from these joys forever.  Then she said to herself,  \"But\nno one need apologize for being alive and for hoping.  I must\ntry to justify him for all he did for me.\"\n\nA few miles of beautiful water highway between circling shores\nof green, and afar off through the mist Madame Clélie's\nfascinated eyes beheld a city of enchantment.  It appeared and\ndisappeared, reappeared only to disappear again, as its veil\nof azure mist was blown into thick or thin folds by the light\nbreeze.  One moment the Frenchwoman would think there was\nnothing ahead but more and ever more of the bay glittering in\nthe summer sunlight.  The next moment she would see again that\ncity--or was it a mirage of a city?--towers, mighty walls,\ndomes rising mass above mass, summit above summit, into the\nvery heavens from the water's edge where there was a fringe of\ngreen.  Surely the vision must be real; yet how could tiny man\nout of earth and upon earth rear in such enchantment of line\nand color those enormous masses, those peak-like piercings of\nthe sky?\n\n\"Is that--_it?_\" she asked in an awed undertone.\n\nSusan nodded.  She, too, was gazing spellbound.  Her beloved\nCity of the Sun.\n\n\"But it is beautiful--beautiful beyond belief.  And I have\nalways heard that New York was ugly.\"\n\n\"It is beautiful--and ugly--both beyond belief!\" replied Susan.\n\n\"No wonder you love it!\"\n\n\"Yes--I love it.  I have loved it from the first moment I saw\nit.  I've never stopped loving it--not even----\"  She did not\nfinish her sentence but gazed dreamily at the city appearing\nand disappearing in its veils of thin, luminous mist.  Her\nthoughts traveled again the journey of her life in New York.\nWhen she spoke again, it was to say:\n\n\"Yes--when I first saw it--that spring evening--I called it my\nCity of the Stars, then, for I didn't know that it belonged to\nthe sun--  Yes, that spring evening I was happier than I ever\nhad been--or ever shall be again.\"\n\n\"But you will be happy again dear,\" said Clélie, tenderly\npressing her arm.\n\nA faint sad smile--sad but still a smile--made Susan's\nbeautiful face lovely.  \"Yes, I shall be happy--not in those\nways--but happy, for I shall be busy. . . .  No, I don't take the\ntragic view of life--not at all.  And as I've known misery, I\ndon't try to hold to it.\"\n\n\"Leave that,\" said Clélie, \"to those who have known only the\ncomfortable make-believe miseries that rustle in crêpe and\nshed tears--whenever there's anyone by to see.\"\n\n\"Like the beggars who begin to whine and exhibit their\naggravated sores as soon as a possible giver comes into view,\"\nsaid Susan.  \"I've learned to accept what comes, and to try to\nmake the best of it, whatever it is. . . .  I say I've learned.\nBut have I?  Does one ever change?  I guess I was born that\nsort of philosopher.\"\n\nShe recalled how she put the Warhams out of her life as soon\nas she discovered what they really meant to her and she to\nthem--how she had put Jeb Ferguson out of her life--how she\nhad conquered the grief and desolation of the loss of\nBurlingham--how she had survived Etta's going away without\nher--the inner meaning of her episodes with Rod--with Freddie\nPalmer----\n\nAnd now this last supreme test--with her soul rising up and\ngathering itself together and lifting its head in strength----\n\n\"Yes, I was born to make the best of things,\" she repeated.\n\n\"Then you were born lucky,\" sighed Clélie, who was of those\nwho must lean if they would not fall and lie where they fell.\n\nSusan gave a curious little laugh--with no mirth, with a great\ndeal of mockery.  \"Do you know, I never thought so before, but\nI believe you're right,\" said she.  Again she laughed in that\nqueer way.  \"If you knew my life you'd think I was joking.\nBut I'm not.  The fact that I've survived and am what I am\nproves I was born lucky.\"  Her tone changed, her expression\nbecame unreadable.  \"If it's lucky to be born able to live.\nAnd if that isn't luck, what is?\"\n\nShe thought how Brent said she was born lucky because she had\nthe talent that enables one to rise above the sordidness of\nthat capitalism he so often denounced--the sordidness of the\nlot of its slaves, the sordidness of the lot of its masters.\nBrent!  If it were he leaning beside her--if he and she were\ncoming up the bay toward the City of the Sun!\n\nA billow of heartsick desolation surged over her.\nAlone--always alone.  And still alone.  And always to be alone.\n\nGarvey came aboard when the gangway was run out.  He was in\nblack wherever black could be displayed.  But the grief\nshadowing his large, simple countenance had the stamp of the\ngenuine.  And it was genuine, of the most approved enervating\nkind.  He had done nothing but grieve since his master's\ndeath--had left unattended all the matters the man he loved\nand grieved for would have wished put in order.  Is it out of\ncharity for the weakness of human nature and that we may think\nas well as possible of it--is that why we admire and praise\nmost enthusiastically the kind of love and the kind of\nfriendship and the kind of grief that manifest themselves in\nobstreperous feeling and wordiness, with no strength left for\nany attempt to _do?_  As Garvey greeted them the tears filled\nClélie's eyes and she turned away.  But Susan gazed at him\nsteadily; in her eyes there were no tears, but a look that\nmade Garvey choke back sobs and bend his head to hide his\nexpression.  What he saw--or felt--behind her calmness filled\nhim with awe, with a kind of terror.  But he did not recognize\nwhat he saw as grief; it did not resemble any grief he had\nfelt or had heard about.\n\n\"He made a will just before he died,\" he said to Susan.  \"He\nleft everything to you.\"\n\nThen she had not been mistaken.  He had loved her, even as she\nloved him.  She turned and walked quickly from them.  She\nhastened into her cabin, closed the door and flung herself\nacross the bed.  And for the first time she gave way.  In that\nstorm her soul was like a little land bird in the clutch of a\nsea hurricane.  She did not understand herself.  She still had\nno sense that he was dead; yet had his dead body been lying\nthere in her arms she could not have been more shaken by\nparoxysms of grief, without tears or sobs--grief that vents\nitself in shrieks and peals of horrible laughter-like\nscreams--she smothered them in the pillows in which she buried\nher face.  Clélie came, opened the door, glanced in, closed\nit.  An hour passed--an hour and a half.  Then Susan appeared\non deck--amber-white pallor, calm, beautiful, the fashionable\nwoman in traveling dress.\n\n\"I never before saw you with your lips not rouged!\" exclaimed Clélie.\n\n\"You will never see them rouged again,\" said Susan.\n\n\"But it makes you look older.\"\n\n\"Not so old as I am,\" replied she.\n\nAnd she busied herself about the details of the landing and\nthe customs, waving aside Garvey and his eager urgings that\nshe sit quietly and leave everything to him.  In the carriage,\non the way to the hotel, she roused herself from her apparently\ntranquil reverie and broke the strained silence by saying:\n\n\"How much shall I have?\"\n\nThe question was merely the protruding end of a train of\nthought years long and pursued all that time with scarcely an\ninterruption.  It seemed abrupt; to Garvey it sounded brutal.\nOff his guard, he showed in flooding color and staring eye how\nprofoundly it shocked him.  Susan saw, but she did not\nexplain; she was not keeping accounts in emotion with the\nworld.  She waited patiently.  After a long pause he said in\na tone that contained as much of rebuke as so mild a dependent\ndared express:\n\n\"He left about thirty thousand a year, Miss Lenox.\"\n\nThe exultant light that leaped to Susan's eye horrified him.\nIt even disturbed Clélie, though she better understood Susan's\nnature and was not nearly so reverent as Garvey of the\nhypocrisies of conventionality.  But Susan had long since lost\nthe last trace of awe of the opinion of others.  She was not\nseeking to convey an impression of grief.  Grief was too real\nto her.  She would as soon have burst out with voluble\nconfession of the secret of her love for Brent.  She saw what\nGarvey was thinking; but she was not concerned.  She continued\nto be herself--natural and simple.  And there was no reason\nwhy she should conceal as a thing to be ashamed of the fact\nthat Brent had accomplished the purpose he intended, had\nfilled her with honest exultation--not with delight merely,\nnot with triumph, but with that stronger and deeper joy which\nthe unhoped for pardon brings to the condemned man.\n\nShe must live on.  The thought of suicide, of any form of\ngiving up--the thought that instantly possesses the weak and\nthe diseased--could not find lodgment in that young, healthy\nbody and mind of hers.  She must live on; and suddenly she\ndiscovered that she could live _free!_  Not after years of\ndoubtful struggles, of reverses, of success so hardly won that\nshe was left exhausted.  But now--at once--_free!_  The heavy\nshackles had been stricken off at a blow.  She was\nfree--forever free!  Free, forever free, from the wolves of\npoverty and shame, of want and rags and filth, the wolves that\nhad been pursuing her with swift, hideous padded stride, the\nwolves that more than once had dragged her down and torn and\ntrampled her, and lapped her blood.  Free to enter of her own\nright the world worth living in, the world from which all but\na few are shut out, the world which only a few of those\nprivileged to enter know how to enjoy.  Free to live the life\nworth while the life of leisure to work, instead of slaving to\nmake leisure and luxury and comfort for others.  Free to\nachieve something beside food, clothing, and shelter.  Free to\nlive as _she_ pleased, instead of for the pleasure of a master\nor masters.  Free--free--free!  The ecstasy of it surged up in\nher, for the moment possessing her and submerging even thought\nof how she had been freed.\n\nShe who had never acquired the habit of hypocrisy frankly\nexulted in countenance exultant beyond laughter.  She could\nconceal her feelings, could refrain from expressing.  But if\nshe expressed at all, it must be her true self--what she\nhonestly felt.  Garvey hung his head in shame.  He would not\nhave believed Susan could be so unfeeling.  He would not let\nhis eyes see the painful sight.  He would try to forget, would\ndeny to himself that he had seen.  For to his shallow,\nconventional nature Susan's expression could only mean delight\nin wealth, in the opportunity that now offered to idle and to\nluxuriate in the dead man's money, to realize the crude dreamings\nof those lesser minds whose initial impulses toward growth have\nbeen stifled by the routine our social system imposes upon all\nbut the few with the strength to persist individual.\n\nFree!  She tried to summon the haunting vision of the old\nwomen with the tin cups of whisky reeling and staggering in\ntime to the hunchback's playing.  She could remember every\ndetail, but these memories would not assemble even into a\nvivid picture and the picture would have been far enough from\nthe horror of actuality in the vision she formerly could not\nbanish.  As a menace, as a prophecy, the old women and the\nhunchback and the strumming piano had gone forever.\nFree--secure, independent--free!\n\nAfter a long silence Garvey ventured stammeringly:\n\n\"He said to me--he asked me to request--he didn't make it a\ncondition--just a wish--a hope, Miss Lenox--that if you could,\nand felt it strongly enough----\"\n\n\"Wished what?\" said Susan, with a sharp impatience that showed\nhow her nerves were unstrung.\n\n\"That you'd go on--go on with the plays--with the acting.\"\n\nThe violet eyes expressed wonder.  \"Go on?\" she inquired,\n\"Go on?\"  Then in a tone that made Clélie sob and Garvey's\neyes fill she said:\n\n\"What else is there to live for, now?\"\n\n\"I'm--I'm glad for his sake,\" stammered Garvey.\n\nHe was disconcerted by her smile.  She made no other\nanswer--aloud.  For _his_ sake!  For her own sake, rather.\nWhat other life had she but the life _he_ had given her?  \"And\nhe knew I would,\" she said to herself.  \"He said that merely to\nlet me know he left me entirely free.  How like him, to do that!\"\n\nAt the hotel she shut herself in; she saw no one, not even\nClélie, for nearly a week.  Then--she went to work--and worked\nlike a reincarnation of Brent.\n\n\nShe inquired for Sperry, found that he and Rod had separated\nas they no longer needed each other; she went into a sort of\npartnership with Sperry for the production of Brent's\nplays--he, an excellent coach as well as stage director,\nhelping her to finish her formal education for the stage.  She\nplayed with success half a dozen of the already produced Brent\nplays.  At the beginning of her second season she appeared\nin what has become her most famous part--_Roxy_ in Brent's last\nplay, \"The Scandal.\"  With the opening night her career of\ntriumph began.  Even the critics--therefore, not unnaturally,\nsuspicious of an actress who was so beautiful, so beautifully\ndressed, so well supported, and so well outfitted with\nactor-proof plays even the critics conceded her ability.  She\nwas worthy of the great character Brent had created--the\nwayward, many-sided, ever gay _Roxy Grandon_.\n\nWhen, at the first night of \"The Scandal,\" the audience\nlingered, cheering Brent's picture thrown upon a drop,\ncheering Susan, calling her out again and again, refusing to\nleave the theater until it was announced that she could answer\nno more calls, as she had gone home--when she was thus finally\nand firmly established in her own right--she said to Sperry:\n\n\"Will you see to it that every sketch of me that appears\ntomorrow says that I am the natural daughter of Lorella Lenox?\"\n\nSperry's Punch-like face reddened.\n\n\"I've been ashamed of that fact,\" she went on.  \"It has made\nme ashamed to be alive in the bottom of my heart.\"\n\n\"Absurd,\" said Sperry.\n\n\"Exactly,\" replied Susan.  \"Absurd.  Even stronger than my\nshame about it has been my shame that I could be so small as\nto feel ashamed of it.  Now--tonight\" she was still in her\ndressing-room.  As she paused they heard the faint faraway\nthunders of the applause of the lingering audience--\"Listen!\"\nshe cried.  \"I am ashamed no longer.  Sperry, _Ich bin ein Ich!_\"\n\n\"I should say,\" laughed he.  \"All you have to say is 'Susan\nLenox' and you answer all questions.\"\n\n\"At last I'm proud of it,\" she went on.  \"I've justified\nmyself.  I've justified my mother.  I am proud of her, and she\nwould be proud of me.  So see that it's done, Sperry.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said he.  \"You're right.\"\n\nHe took her hand and kissed it.  She laughed, patted him on the\nshoulder, kissed him on both cheeks in friendly, sisterly fashion.\n\nHe had just gone when a card was brought to her--\"Dr. Robert\nStevens\"--with \"Sutherland, Indiana,\" penciled underneath.\nInstantly she remembered, and had him brought to her--the man\nwho had rescued her from death at her birth.  He proved to be\na quiet, elderly gentleman, subdued and aged beyond his\nfifty-five years by the monotonous life of the drowsy old\ntown.  He approached with a manner of embarrassed respect and\ndeference, stammering old-fashioned compliments.  But Susan\nwas the simple, unaffected girl again, so natural that he soon\nfelt as much at ease as with one of his patients in Sutherland.\n\nShe took him away in her car to her apartment for supper with\nher and Clélie, who was in the company, and Sperry.  She kept\nhim hour after hour, questioning him about everyone and\neverything in the old town, drawing him out, insisting upon\nmore and more details.  The morning papers were brought and\nthey read the accounts of play and author and players.  For\nonce there was not a dissent; all the critics agreed that it\nwas a great performance of a great play.  And Susan made\nSperry read aloud the finest and the longest of the accounts\nof Brent himself--his life, his death, his work, his lasting\nfame now peculiarly assured because in Susan Lenox there had\nbeen found a competent interpreter of his genius.\n\nAfter the reading there fell silence.  Susan, her pallid face\nand her luminous, inquiring violet eyes inscrutable, sat\ngazing into vacancy.  At last Doctor Stevens moved uneasily\nand rose to go.  Susan roused herself, accompanied him to the\nadjoining room.  Said the old doctor.\n\n\"I've told you about everybody.  But you've told me nothing\nabout the most interesting Sutherlander of all--yourself.\"\n\nSusan looked at him.  And he saw the wound hidden from all the\nworld--the wound she hid from herself as much of the time as\nshe could.  He, the doctor, the professional confessor, had\nseen such wounds often; in all the world there is hardly a\nheart without one.  He said:\n\n\"Since sorrow is the common lot, I wonder that men can be so\nselfish or so unthinking as not to help each other in every\nway to its consolations.  Poor creatures that we\nare--wandering in the dark, fighting desperately, not knowing\nfriend from foe!\"\n\n\"But I am glad that you saved me,\" said she.\n\n\"You have the consolations--success--fame--honor.\"\n\n\"There is no consolation,\" replied she in her grave sweet way.\n\"I had the best.  I--lost him.  I shall spend my life in\nflying from myself.\"\n\nAfter a pause she went on:  \"I shall never speak to anyone as\nI have spoken to you.  You will understand all.  I had the\nbest--the man who could have given me all a woman seeks from\na man--love, companionship, sympathy, the shelter of strong\narms.  I had that.  I have lost it.  So----\"\n\nA long pause.  Then she added:\n\n\"Usually life is almost tasteless to me.  Again--for an hour\nor two it is a little less so--until I remember what I have\nlost.  Then--the taste is very bitter--very bitter.\"\n\nAnd she turned away.\n\n\nShe is a famous actress, reputed great.  Some day she will be\nindeed great--when she has the stage experience and the years.\nExcept for Clélie, she is alone.  Not that there have been no\nfriendships in her life.  There have even been passions.  With\nmen and women of her vigor and vitality, passion is\ninevitable.  But those she admits find that she has little to\ngive, and they go away, she making no effort to detain them;\nor she finds that she has nothing to give, and sends them away\nas gently as may be.  She has the reputation of caring for\nnothing but her art--and for the great establishment for\norphans up the Hudson, into which about all her earnings go.\nThe establishment is named for Brent and is dedicated to her\nmother.  Is she happy?  I do not know.  I do not think she\nknows.  Probably she is--as long as she can avoid pausing to\nthink whether she is or not.  What better happiness can\nintelligent mortal have, or hope for?  Certainly she is\ntriumphant, is lifted high above the storms that tortured her\ngirlhood and early youth, the sordid woes that make life an\nunrelieved tragedy of calamity threatened and calamity realized\nfor the masses of mankind.  The last time I saw her----\n\nIt was a few evenings ago, and she was crossing the sidewalk\nbefore her house toward the big limousine that was to take her\nto the theater.  She is still young; she looked even younger\nthan she is.  Her dress had the same exquisite quality that\nmade her the talk of Paris in the days of her sojourn there.\nBut it is not her dress that most interests me, nor the luxury\nand perfection of all her surroundings.  It is not even her\nbeauty--that is, the whole of her beauty.\n\nEverything and every being that is individual in appearance\nhas some one quality, trait, characteristic, which stands out\nabove all the rest to make a climax of interest and charm.\nWith the rose it is its perfume; with the bird, perhaps the\nscarlet or snowy feathers upon its breast.  Among human beings\nwho have the rare divine dower of clear individuality the\ncrown and cap of distinction differs.  In her--for me, at\nleast--the consummate fascination is not in her eyes, though I\nam moved by the soft glory of their light, nor in the lovely\noval contour of her sweet, healthily pallid face.  No, it is\nin her mouth--sensitive, strong yet gentle, suggestive of all\nthe passion and suffering and striving that have built up her\nlife.  Her mouth--the curve of it--I think it is, that sends\nfrom time to time the mysterious thrill through her audiences.\nAnd I imagine those who know her best look always first at\nthose strangely pale lips, curved in a way that suggests\nbitterness melting into sympathy, sadness changing into\nmirth--a way that seems to say:  \"I have suffered--but, see!\nI have stood fast!\"\n\nCan a life teach any deeper lesson, give any higher inspiration?\n\nAs I was saying, the last time I saw her she was about to\nenter her automobile.  I halted and watched the graceful\nmovements with which she took her seat and gathered the robes\nabout her.  And then I noted her profile, by the light of the\nbig lamps guarding her door.  You know that profile?  You have\nseen its same expression in every profile of successful man or\nwoman who ever lived.  Yes, she may be happy--doubtless is\nmore happy than unhappy.  But--I do not envy her--or any other\nof the sons and daughters of men who is blessed--and\ncursed--with imagination.\n\nAnd Freddie--and Rod--and Etta--and the people of\nSutherland--and all the rest who passed through her life and\nout?  What does it matter?  Some went up, some down--not\nwithout reason, but, alas! not for reason of desert.  For the\njudgments of fate are, for the most part, not unlike blows\nfrom a lunatic striking out in the dark; if they land where\nthey should, it is rarely and by sheer chance.  Ruth's parents\nare dead; she is married to Sam Wright.  He lost his father's\nmoney in wheat speculation in Chicago--in one of the most\nsuccessful of the plutocracy's constantly recurring raids upon\nthe hoardings of the middle class.  They live in a little\nhouse in one of the back streets of Sutherland and he is head\nclerk in Arthur Sinclair's store--a position he owes to the\nfact that Sinclair is his rich brother-in-law.  Ruth has\nchildren and she is happier in them than she realizes or than\nher discontented face and voice suggest.  Etta is fat and\ncontented, the mother of many, and fond of her fat, fussy\nAugust, the rich brewer.  John Redmond--a congressman, a\npossession of the Beef Trust, I believe--but not so highly\nprized a possession as was his abler father.\n\nFreddie?  I saw him a year ago at the races at Auteuil.  He is\nhuge and loose and coarse, is in the way soon to die of\nBright's disease, I suspect.  There was a woman with him--very\npretty, very _chic_.  I saw no other woman similarly placed\nwhose eyes held so assiduously, and without ever a wandering\nflutter, to the face of the man who was paying.  But Freddie\nnever noticed her.  He chewed savagely at his cigar, looking\nabout the while for things to grumble at or to curse.  Rod?\nHe is still writing indifferent plays with varying success.\nHe long since wearied of Constance Francklyn, but she clings\nto him and, as she is a steady moneymaker, he tolerates her.\n\nBrent?  He is statelily ensconced up at Woodlawn.  Susan has\nnever been to his grave--there.  His grave in her heart--she\navoids that too, when she can.  But there are times--there\nalways will be times----\n\nIf you doubt it, look at her profile.\n\nYes, she has learned to live.  But--she has paid the price."
