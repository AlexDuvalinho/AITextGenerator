There was\nat the first contact both bloom and charm; and most of all there was life.\nTo use the word his friends describe him by, he was \"vivid\".\nThis vitality, though manifold in expression, is felt primarily\nin his sensations -- surprise mingled with delight --\n\n    \"One after one, like tasting a sweet food.\"\n\nThis is life's \"first fine rapture\".  It makes him patient to\nname over those myriad things (each of which seems like a fresh discovery)\ncurious but potent, and above all common, that he \"loved\", --\nhe the \"Great Lover\".  Lover of what, then?  Why, of\n\n    \"White plates and cups clean-gleaming,\n    Ringed with blue lines,\" --\n\nand the like, through thirty lines of exquisite words; and he is captivated\nby the multiple brevity of these vignettes of sense, keen, momentary,\necstatic with the morning dip of youth in the wonderful stream.\nThe poem is a catalogue of vital sensations and \"dear names\" as well.\n\"All these have been my loves.\"\n\nThe spring of these emotions is the natural body, but it sends pulsations\nfar into the spirit.  The feeling rises in direct observation,\nbut it is soon aware of the \"outlets of the sky\".\nHe sees objects practically unrelated, and links them in strings;\nor he sees them pictorially; or, he sees pictures immersed as it were\nin an atmosphere of thought.  When the process is complete,\nthe thought suggests the picture and is its origin.\nThen the Great Lover revisits the bottom of the monstrous world,\nand imaginatively and thoughtfully recreates that strange under-sea,\nwhose glooms and gleams and muds are well known to him as\na strong and delighted swimmer; or, at the last, drifts through the dream\nof a South Sea lagoon, still with a philosophical question in his mouth.\nYet one can hardly speak of \"completion\".  These are real first flights.\nWhat we have in this volume is not so much a work of art\nas an artist in his birth trying the wings of genius.\n\nThe poet loves his new-found element.  He clings to mortality;\nto life, not thought; or, as he puts it, to the concrete, --\nlet the abstract \"go pack!\"  \"There's little comfort in the wise,\" he ends.\nBut in the unfolding of his precocious spirit, the literary control\ncomes uppermost; his boat, finding its keel, swings to the helm of mind.\nHow should it be otherwise for a youth well-born, well-bred,\nin college air?  Intellectual primacy showed itself to him\nin many wandering \"loves\", fine lover that he was; but in the end\nhe was an intellectual lover, and the magnet seems to have been\nespecially powerful in the ghosts of the men of \"wit\", Donne, Marvell --\nerudite lords of language, poets in another world than ours,\na less \"ample ether\", a less \"divine air\", our fathers thought,\nbut poets of \"eternity\".  A quintessential drop of intellect\nis apt to be in poetic blood.  How Platonism fascinates the poets,\nlike a shining bait!  Rupert Brooke will have none of it;\nbut at a turn of the verse he is back at it, examining, tasting, refusing.\nIn those alternate drives of the thought in his South Sea idyl\n(clever as tennis play) how he slips from phenomenon to idea and reverses,\nhappy with either, it seems, \"were t'other dear charmer away\".\nHow bravely he tries to free himself from the cling of earth,\nat the close of the \"Great Lover\"!  How little he succeeds!\nHis muse knew only earthly tongues, -- so far as he understood.\n\nWhy this persistent cling to mortality, -- with its quick-coming cry\nagainst death and its heaped anathemas on the transformations of decay?\nIt is the old story once more: -- the vision of the first poets,\nthe world that \"passes away\".  The poetic eye of Keats saw it, --\n\n               \"Beauty that must die,\n    And Joy whose hand is ever at his lips\n    Bidding adieu.\"\n\nThe reflective mind of Arnold meditated it, --\n\n                    \"the world that seems\n    To lie before us like a land of dreams,\n    So various, so beautiful, so new,\n    Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\n    Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain.\" --\n\nSo Rupert Brooke, --\n\n                         \"But the best I've known,\n    Stays here, and changes, breaks, grows old, is blown\n    About the winds of the world, and fades from brains\n    Of living men, and dies.\n                                 Nothing remains.\"\n\nAnd yet, --\n\n    \"Oh, never a doubt but somewhere I shall wake;\"\n\nagain, --\n\n                                   \"the light,\n    Returning, shall give back the golden hours,\n    Ocean a windless level. . . .\"\n\nagain, best of all, in the last word, --\n\n    \"Still may Time hold some golden space\n     Where I'll unpack that scented store\n    Of song and flower and sky and face,\n     And count, and touch, and turn them o'er,\n    Musing upon them.\"\n\nHe cannot forego his sensations, that \"box of compacted sweets\".\nHe even forefeels a ghostly landscape where two shall go wandering\nthrough the night, \"alone\".  So the faith that broke its chrysalis\nin the first disillusionment of boyhood, in \"Second Best\",\nbeautiful with the burden of Greek lyricism, ends triumphant\nwith the spirit still unsubdued. --\n\n    \"Proud, then, clear-eyed and laughing, go to greet\n    Death as a friend.\"\n\nSo go, \"with unreluctant tread\".  But in the disillusionment of beauty\nand of love there is an older tone.  With what bitter savor, with what\ngrossness of diction, caught from the Elizabethan and satirical elements\nin his culture, he spends anger in words!  He reacts, he rebels, he storms.\nA dozen poems hardly exhaust his gall.  It is not merely\nthat beauty and joy and love are transient, now, but in their going\nthey are corrupted into their opposites, -- ugliness, pain, indifference.\nAnd his anger once stilled by speech, what lassitude follows!\n\nLife, in this volume, is hardly less evident by its ecstasy\nthan by its collapse.  It is a book of youth, sensitive, vigorous, sound;\nbut it is the fruit of intensity, and bears the traits.\nThe search for solitude, the relief from crowds, the open door into nature;\nthe sense of flight and escape; the repeated thought of safety,\nthe insistent fatigue, the cry for sleep; -- all these bear confession\nin their faces.  \"Flight\", \"Town and Country\", \"The Voice\", are eloquent\nof what they leave untold; and the climax of \"Retrospect\", --\n\n    \"And I should sleep, and I should sleep,\" --\n\nor the sestet of \"Waikiki\", or the whole fainting sonnet\nentitled \"A Memory\", belong to the nadir of vitality.  At moments\nweariness set in like a spiritual tide.  I associate, too, with such moods,\npsychologically at least, his visions of the \"arrested moment\", as in\n\"Dining-Room Tea\", -- a sort of trance state -- or in the pendant sonnet.\nAnalogous moods are not infrequent in the great poets.  Rupert Brooke\nseems to have faltered, nervously, at times; these poems mirror faithfully\nsuch moments.  But even when the image of life, imaginative or real,\nfalters so, how essentially vital it still is, and clothed in an exquisite\nbody of words like the traditional \"rainbow hues of the dying fish\"!\nFor I cannot express too strongly my admiration of the literary sense\nof this young poet, and my delight in it.  \"All these have been my loves,\"\nhe says, if I may repeat the phrase; but he seems to have loved the words,\nas much as the things, -- \"dear names\", he adds.  The born man of letters\nspeaks there.  So, when his pulse is at its lowest,\nhe cannot forget the beautiful surface of his South Sea idyls\nor of versified English gardens and lanes.  He cared as much\nfor the expression as for the thing, which is what makes a man of letters.\nSo fixed is this habit that his art, truly, is independent\nof his bodily state.  In his poems of \"collapse\" as in those of \"ecstasy\"\nhe seems to me equally master of his mood, -- like those poets who are\n\"for all time\".  His literary skill in verse was ripe, how long so ever\nhe might have to live.\n\n\nII\n\nTo come, then, to art, which is above personality, what of that?  Art is,\nat most, but the mortal relic of genius; yet it is true of it that,\nlike Ozymandias' statue, \"nothing beside remains\".  Rupert Brooke was\nalready perfected in verbal and stylistic execution.  He might have grown\nin variety, richness and significance, in scope and in detail, no doubt;\nbut as an artisan in metrical words and pauses, he was past apprenticeship.\nHe was still a restless experimenter, but in much he was a master.\nIn the brief stroke of description, which he inherited from\nhis early attachment to the concrete; in the rush of words,\nespecially verbs; in the concatenation of objects, the flow of things\n'en masse' through his verse, still with the impulse of \"the bright speed\"\nhe had at the source; in his theatrical impersonation of abstractions,\nas in \"The Funeral of Youth\", where for once the abstract and the concrete\nare happily fused; -- in all these there are the elements, and in the last\nthere is the perfection, of mastery.  For one thing, he knew how to end.\nIt is with him a dramatic secret.  The brief stroke does this work\ntime and time again in his verse, nowhere better than in\n\"at dead YOUTH's funeral:\" all were there, --\n\n    \"All, except only LOVE -- LOVE had died long ago.\"\n\nThe poem is like a vision of an old time MASQUE: --\n\n    \"The sweet lad RHYME\" ----\n    \"ARDOUR, the sunlight on his greying hair\" ----\n    \"BEAUTY . . . pale in her black; dry-eyed, she stood alone.\"\n\nHow vivid!  The lines owe something to his eye for costume, for staging;\nbut, as mere picture writing, it is as firm as if carved on an obelisk.\nAnd as he reconciled concrete and abstract here, so he had left\nhis short breath, in those earlier lines, behind, and had come into\nthe long sweep and open water of great style: --\n\n    \"And light on waving grass, he knows not when,\n    And feet that ran, but where, he cannot tell.\"\n\nOr; --\n\n    \"And feel, who have laid our groping hands away;\n    And see, no longer blinded by our eyes,\"\n\nOr, more briefly, --\n\n    \"In wise majestic melancholy train.\"\n\nAnd this, --\n\n    \"And evening hush broken by homing wings,\"\n\nSuch lines as these, apart from their beauty, are in the best manner\nof English poetic style.  So, in many minor ways, he shuffled\ncontrast and climax, and the like, adept in the handling\nof poetic rhetoric that he had come to be; but in three ways\nhe was conspicuously successful in his art.\n\nThe first of these -- they are all in the larger forms of art --\nis the dramatic sonnet, by which I do not mean merely\na sonnet in dialogue or advancing by simple contrast;\nbut one in which there may be these things, but also there is\na tragic reversal or its equivalent.  Not to consider it too curiously,\ntake \"The Hill\".  This sonnet is beautiful in action and diction;\nits eloquence speeds it on with a lift; the situation is\nthe very crest of life; then, --\n\n    \"We shall go down with unreluctant tread,\n    Rose-crowned into the darkness! . . .  Proud we were,\n    And laughed, that had such brave true things to say.\n    -- And then you suddenly cried and turned away.\"\n\nThe dramatic sonnet in English has not gone beyond that, for beauty,\nfor brevity, for tragic effect, -- nor, I add, for unspoken loyalty\nto reality.  Reality was, perhaps, what he most dearly wished for;\nhere he achieved it.  In many another sonnet he won the laurel;\nbut if I were to venture to choose, it is in the dramatic handling\nof the sonnet that he is most individual and characteristic.\n\nThe second great success of his genius, formally considered,\nlay in the narrative idyl, either in the Miltonic way of flashing bits\nof English country landscape before the eye, as in \"Grantchester\",\nor by applying essentially the same method to the water world of fishes\nor the South Sea world, both on a philosophic background.\nThese are all master poems of a kaleidoscopic beauty and charm,\nwhere the brief pictures play in and out of a woven veil of thought,\nirony, mood, with a delightful intellectual pleasuring.\nHe thoroughly enjoys doing the poetical magic.  Such bits of\nEnglish retreats or Pacific paradises, so full of idyllic charm,\nexquisite in image and movement, are among the rarest of poetic treasures.\nThe thought of Milton and of Marvell only adds an old world charm\nto the most modern of the works of the Muses.  What lightness of touch,\nwhat ease of movement, what brilliancy of hue!  What vivacity throughout!\nEven in \"Retrospect\", what actuality!\n\nAnd the third success is what I should call the \"melange\".  That is,\nthe method of indiscrimination by which he gathers up experience,\nand pours it out again in language, with full disregard\nof its relative values.  His good taste saves him from what in another\nwould be shipwreck, but this indifference to values, this apparent lack\nof selection in material, while at times it gives a huddled flow,\nmore than anything else \"modernizes\" the verse.  It yields, too,\nan effect of abundant vitality, and it makes facile the change\nfrom grave to gay and the like.  The \"melange\", as I call it,\nis rather an innovation in English verse, and to be found only rarely.\nIt exists, however; and especially it was dear to Keats in his youth.\nIt is by excellent taste, and by style, that the poet here overcomes\nits early difficulties.\n\nIn these three formal ways, besides in minor matters, it appears to me\nthat Rupert Brooke, judged by the most orthodox standards,\nhad succeeded in poetry.\n\n\nIII\n\nBut in his first notes, if I may indulge my private taste,\nI find more of the intoxication of the god.  These early poems\nare the lyrical cries and luminous flares of a dawn, no doubt;\nbut they are incarnate of youth.  Capital among them is \"Blue Evening\".\nIt is original and complete.  In its whispering embraces of sense,\nin the terror of seizure of the spirit, in the tranquil euthanasia\nof the end by the touch of speechless beauty, it seems to me a true symbol\nof life whole and entire.  It is beautiful in language and feeling,\nwith an extraordinary clarity and rise of power; and, above all,\nthough rare in experience, it is real.  A young poet's poem;\nbut it has a quality never captured by perfect art.  A poem for poets,\nno doubt; but that is the best kind.  So, too, the poem,\nentitled \"Sleeping Out\", charms me and stirs me with\nits golden clangors and crying flames of emotion as it mounts up\nto \"the white one flame\", to \"the laughter and the lips of light\".\nIt is like a holy Italian picture, -- remote, inaccessible, alone.\nThe \"white flame\" seems to have had a mystic meaning to the boy;\nit occurs repeatedly.  And another poem, -- not to make\ntoo long a story of my private enthusiasms -- \"Ante Aram\", --\nwakes all my classical blood, --\n\n        \"voice more sweet than the far plaint of viols is,\n    Or the soft moan of any grey-eyed lute player.\"\n\nBut these things are arcana.\n\n\nIV\n\nThere is a grave in Scyros, amid the white and pinkish marble of the isle,\nthe wild thyme and the poppies, near the green and blue waters.\nThere Rupert Brooke was buried.  Thither have gone the thoughts\nof his countrymen, and the hearts of the young especially.\nIt will long be so.  For a new star shines in the English heavens.\n                                                                   G. E.

Only -- grows\n   An eddy in that ordered falling,\n   A knowledge from the gloom, a calling\n   Weed in the wave, gleam in the mud --\n   The dark fire leaps along his blood;\n   Dateless and deathless, blind and still,\n   The intricate impulse works its will;\n   His woven world drops back; and he,\n   Sans providence, sans memory,\n   Unconscious and directly driven,\n   Fades to some dank sufficient heaven.\n\n   O world of lips, O world of laughter,\n   Where hope is fleet and thought flies after,\n   Of lights in the clear night, of cries\n   That drift along the wave and rise\n   Thin to the glittering stars above,\n   You know the hands, the eyes of love!\n   The strife of limbs, the sightless clinging,\n   The infinite distance, and the singing\n   Blown by the wind, a flame of sound,\n   The gleam, the flowers, and vast around\n   The horizon, and the heights above --\n   You know the sigh, the song of love!\n\n   But there the night is close, and there\n   Darkness is cold and strange and bare;\n   And the secret deeps are whisperless;\n   And rhythm is all deliciousness;\n   And joy is in the throbbing tide,\n   Whose intricate fingers beat and glide\n   In felt bewildering harmonies\n   Of trembling touch; and music is\n   The exquisite knocking of the blood.\n   Space is no more, under the mud;\n   His bliss is older than the sun.\n   Silent and straight the waters run.\n   The lights, the cries, the willows dim,\n   And the dark tide are one with him.\n\n\n\n\nThoughts on the Shape of the Human Body\n\n\n\n   How can we find? how can we rest? how can\n   We, being gods, win joy, or peace, being man?\n   We, the gaunt zanies of a witless Fate,\n   Who love the unloving and lover hate,\n   Forget the moment ere the moment slips,\n   Kiss with blind lips that seek beyond the lips,\n   Who want, and know not what we want, and cry\n   With crooked mouths for Heaven, and throw it by.\n   Love's for completeness!  No perfection grows\n   'Twixt leg, and arm, elbow, and ear, and nose,\n   And joint, and socket; but unsatisfied\n   Sprawling desires, shapeless, perverse, denied.\n   Finger with finger wreathes; we love, and gape,\n   Fantastic shape to mazed fantastic shape,\n   Straggling, irregular, perplexed, embossed,\n   Grotesquely twined, extravagantly lost\n   By crescive paths and strange protuberant ways\n   From sanity and from wholeness and from grace.\n   How can love triumph, how can solace be,\n   Where fever turns toward fever, knee toward knee?\n   Could we but fill to harmony, and dwell\n   Simple as our thought and as perfectible,\n   Rise disentangled from humanity\n   Strange whole and new into simplicity,\n   Grow to a radiant round love, and bear\n   Unfluctuant passion for some perfect sphere,\n   Love moon to moon unquestioning, and be\n   Like the star Lunisequa, steadfastly\n   Following the round clear orb of her delight,\n   Patiently ever, through the eternal night!\n\n\n\n\nFlight\n\n\n\n   Voices out of the shade that cried,\n    And long noon in the hot calm places,\n   And children's play by the wayside,\n    And country eyes, and quiet faces --\n    All these were round my steady paces.\n\n   Those that I could have loved went by me;\n    Cool gardened homes slept in the sun;\n   I heard the whisper of water nigh me,\n    Saw hands that beckoned, shone, were gone\n    In the green and gold.  And I went on.\n\n   For if my echoing footfall slept,\n    Soon a far whispering there'd be\n   Of a little lonely wind that crept\n    From tree to tree, and distantly\n    Followed me, followed me. . . .\n\n   But the blue vaporous end of day\n    Brought peace, and pursuit baffled quite,\n   Where between pine-woods dipped the way.\n    I turned, slipped in and out of sight.\n    I trod as quiet as the night.\n\n   The pine-boles kept perpetual hush;\n    And in the boughs wind never swirled.\n   I found a flowering lowly bush,\n    And bowed, slid in, and sighed and curled,\n    Hidden at rest from all the world.\n\n   Safe!  I was safe, and glad, I knew!\n    Yet -- with cold heart and cold wet brows\n   I lay.  And the dark fell. . . .  There grew\n    Meward a sound of shaken boughs;\n    And ceased, above my intricate house;\n\n   And silence, silence, silence found me. . . .\n    I felt the unfaltering movement creep\n   Among the leaves.  They shed around me\n    Calm clouds of scent, that I did weep;\n    And stroked my face.  I fell asleep.\n\n\n\n\nThe Hill\n\n\n\n   Breathless, we flung us on the windy hill,\n    Laughed in the sun, and kissed the lovely grass.\n    You said, \"Through glory and ecstasy we pass;\n   Wind, sun, and earth remain, the birds sing still,\n   When we are old, are old. . . .\"  \"And when we die\n    All's over that is ours; and life burns on\n   Through other lovers, other lips,\" said I,\n   -- \"Heart of my heart, our heaven is now, is won!\"\n\n   \"We are Earth's best, that learnt her lesson here.\n    Life is our cry.  We have kept the faith!\" we said;\n    \"We shall go down with unreluctant tread\n   Rose-crowned into the darkness!\" . . .  Proud we were,\n   And laughed, that had such brave true things to say.\n   -- And then you suddenly cried, and turned away.\n\n\n\n\nThe One Before the Last\n\n\n\n   I dreamt I was in love again\n    With the One Before the Last,\n   And smiled to greet the pleasant pain\n    Of that innocent young past.\n\n   But I jumped to feel how sharp had been\n    The pain when it did live,\n   How the faded dreams of Nineteen-ten\n    Were Hell in Nineteen-five.\n\n   The boy's woe was as keen and clear,\n    The boy's love just as true,\n   And the One Before the Last, my dear,\n    Hurt quite as much as you.\n\n        *    *    *    *    *\n\n   Sickly I pondered how the lover\n    Wrongs the unanswering tomb,\n   And sentimentalizes over\n    What earned a better doom.\n\n   Gently he tombs the poor dim last time,\n    Strews pinkish dust above,\n   And sighs, \"The dear dead boyish pastime!\n    But THIS -- ah, God! -- is Love!\"\n\n   -- Better oblivion hide dead true loves,\n    Better the night enfold,\n   Than men, to eke the praise of new loves,\n    Should lie about the old!\n\n        *    *    *    *    *\n\n   Oh! bitter thoughts I had in plenty.\n    But here's the worst of it --\n   I shall forget, in Nineteen-twenty,\n    YOU ever hurt abit!\n\n\n\n\nThe Jolly Company\n\n\n\n   The stars, a jolly company,\n    I envied, straying late and lonely;\n   And cried upon their revelry:\n    \"O white companionship!  You only\n   In love, in faith unbroken dwell,\n   Friends radiant and inseparable!\"\n\n   Light-heart and glad they seemed to me\n    And merry comrades (EVEN SO\n   GOD OUT OF HEAVEN MAY LAUGH TO SEE\n    THE HAPPY CROWDS; AND NEVER KNOW\n   THAT IN HIS LONE OBSCURE DISTRESS\n   EACH WALKETH IN A WILDERNESS).\n\n   But I, remembering, pitied well\n    And loved them, who, with lonely light,\n   In empty infinite spaces dwell,\n    Disconsolate.  For, all the night,\n   I heard the thin gnat-voices cry,\n   Star to faint star, across the sky.\n\n\n\n\nThe Life Beyond\n\n\n\n   He wakes, who never thought to wake again,\n    Who held the end was Death.  He opens eyes\n   Slowly, to one long livid oozing plain\n    Closed down by the strange eyeless heavens.  He lies;\n    And waits; and once in timeless sick surmise\n   Through the dead air heaves up an unknown hand,\n   Like a dry branch.  No life is in that land,\n    Himself not lives, but is a thing that cries;\n   An unmeaning point upon the mud; a speck\n    Of moveless horror; an Immortal One\n   Cleansed of the world, sentient and dead; a fly\n    Fast-stuck in grey sweat on a corpse's neck.\n\n   I thought when love for you died, I should die.\n   It's dead.  Alone, most strangely, I live on.\n\n\n\n\nLines Written in the Belief That the Ancient Roman Festival of the Dead\n     Was Called Ambarvalia\n\n\n\n   Swings the way still by hollow and hill,\n    And all the world's a song;\n   \"She's far,\" it sings me, \"but fair,\" it rings me,\n    \"Quiet,\" it laughs, \"and strong!\"\n\n   Oh! spite of the miles and years between us,\n    Spite of your chosen part,\n   I do remember; and I go\n    With laughter in my heart.\n\n   So above the little folk that know not,\n    Out of the white hill-town,\n   High up I clamber; and I remember;\n    And watch the day go down.\n\n   Gold is my heart, and the world's golden,\n    And one peak tipped with light;\n   And the air lies still about the hill\n    With the first fear of night;\n\n   Till mystery down the soundless valley\n    Thunders, and dark is here;\n   And the wind blows, and the light goes,\n    And the night is full of fear,\n\n   And I know, one night, on some far height,\n    In the tongue I never knew,\n   I yet shall hear the tidings clear\n    From them that were friends of you.\n\n   They'll call the news from hill to hill,\n    Dark and uncomforted,\n   Earth and sky and the winds; and I\n    Shall know that you are dead.\n\n   I shall not hear your trentals,\n    Nor eat your arval bread;\n   For the kin of you will surely do\n    Their duty by the dead.\n\n   Their little dull greasy eyes will water;\n    They'll paw you, and gulp afresh.\n   They'll sniffle and weep, and their thoughts will creep\n    Like flies on the cold flesh.\n\n   They will put pence on your grey eyes,\n    Bind up your fallen chin,\n   And lay you straight, the fools that loved you\n    Because they were your kin.\n\n   They will praise all the bad about you,\n    And hush the good away,\n   And wonder how they'll do without you,\n    And then they'll go away.\n\n   But quieter than one sleeping,\n    And stranger than of old,\n   You will not stir for weeping,\n    You will not mind the cold;\n\n   But through the night the lips will laugh not,\n    The hands will be in place,\n   And at length the hair be lying still\n    About the quiet face.\n\n   With snuffle and sniff and handkerchief,\n    And dim and decorous mirth,\n   With ham and sherry, they'll meet to bury\n    The lordliest lass of earth.\n\n   The little dead hearts will tramp ungrieving\n    Behind lone-riding you,\n   The heart so high, the heart so living,\n    Heart that they never knew.\n\n   I shall not hear your trentals,\n    Nor eat your arval bread,\n   Nor with smug breath tell lies of death\n    To the unanswering dead.\n\n   With snuffle and sniff and handkerchief,\n    The folk who loved you not\n   Will bury you, and go wondering\n    Back home.  And you will rot.\n\n   But laughing and half-way up to heaven,\n    With wind and hill and star,\n   I yet shall keep, before I sleep,\n    Your Ambarvalia.\n\n\n\n\nDead Men's Love\n\n\n\n   There was a damned successful Poet;\n    There was a Woman like the Sun.\n   And they were dead.  They did not know it.\n    They did not know their time was done.\n       They did not know his hymns\n       Were silence; and her limbs,\n       That had served Love so well,\n       Dust, and a filthy smell.\n\n   And so one day, as ever of old,\n    Hands out, they hurried, knee to knee;\n   On fire to cling and kiss and hold\n    And, in the other's eyes, to see\n       Each his own tiny face,\n       And in that long embrace\n       Feel lip and breast grow warm\n       To breast and lip and arm.\n\n   So knee to knee they sped again,\n    And laugh to laugh they ran, I'm told,\n   Across the streets of Hell . . .\n                                     And then\n    They suddenly felt the wind blow cold,\n       And knew, so closely pressed,\n       Chill air on lip and breast,\n       And, with a sick surprise,\n       The emptiness of eyes.\n\n\n\n\nTown and Country\n\n\n\n   Here, where love's stuff is body, arm and side\n    Are stabbing-sweet 'gainst chair and lamp and wall.\n   In every touch more intimate meanings hide;\n    And flaming brains are the white heart of all.\n\n   Here, million pulses to one centre beat:\n    Closed in by men's vast friendliness, alone,\n   Two can be drunk with solitude, and meet\n    On the sheer point where sense with knowing's one.\n\n   Here the green-purple clanging royal night,\n    And the straight lines and silent walls of town,\n   And roar, and glare, and dust, and myriad white\n    Undying passers, pinnacle and crown\n\n   Intensest heavens between close-lying faces\n    By the lamp's airless fierce ecstatic fire;\n   And we've found love in little hidden places,\n    Under great shades, between the mist and mire.\n\n   Stay! though the woods are quiet, and you've heard\n    Night creep along the hedges.  Never go\n   Where tangled foliage shrouds the crying bird,\n    And the remote winds sigh, and waters flow!\n\n   Lest -- as our words fall dumb on windless noons,\n    Or hearts grow hushed and solitary, beneath\n   Unheeding stars and unfamiliar moons,\n    Or boughs bend over, close and quiet as death, --\n\n   Unconscious and unpassionate and still,\n    Cloud-like we lean and stare as bright leaves stare,\n   And gradually along the stranger hill\n    Our unwalled loves thin out on vacuous air,\n\n   And suddenly there's no meaning in our kiss,\n    And your lit upward face grows, where we lie,\n   Lonelier and dreadfuller than sunlight is,\n    And dumb and mad and eyeless like the sky.\n\n\n\n\nParalysis\n\n\n\n   For moveless limbs no pity I crave,\n    That never were swift!  Still all I prize,\n   Laughter and thought and friends, I have;\n    No fool to heave luxurious sighs\n   For the woods and hills that I never knew.\n   The more excellent way's yet mine!  And you\n\n   Flower-laden come to the clean white cell,\n    And we talk as ever -- am I not the same?\n   With our hearts we love, immutable,\n    You without pity, I without shame.\n   We talk as of old; as of old you go\n   Out under the sky, and laughing, I know,\n\n   Flit through the streets, your heart all me;\n    Till you gain the world beyond the town.\n   Then -- I fade from your heart, quietly;\n    And your fleet steps quicken.  The strong down\n   Smiles you welcome there; the woods that love you\n   Close lovely and conquering arms above you.\n\n   O ever-moving, O lithe and free!\n    Fast in my linen prison I press\n   On impassable bars, or emptily\n    Laugh in my great loneliness.\n   And still in the white neat bed I strive\n   Most impotently against that gyve;\n   Being less now than a thought, even,\n   To you alone with your hills and heaven.\n\n\n\n\nMenelaus and Helen\n\n\n\n     I\n\n   Hot through Troy's ruin Menelaus broke\n    To Priam's palace, sword in hand, to sate\n    On that adulterous whore a ten years' hate\n   And a king's honour.  Through red death, and smoke,\n   And cries, and then by quieter ways he strode,\n    Till the still innermost chamber fronted him.\n    He swung his sword, and crashed into the dim\n   Luxurious bower, flaming like a god.\n\n   High sat white Helen, lonely and serene.\n    He had not remembered that she was so fair,\n   And that her neck curved down in such a way;\n   And he felt tired.  He flung the sword away,\n    And kissed her feet, and knelt before her there,\n   The perfect Knight before the perfect Queen.\n\n\n     II\n\n   So far the poet.  How should he behold\n    That journey home, the long connubial years?\n    He does not tell you how white Helen bears\n   Child on legitimate child, becomes a scold,\n   Haggard with virtue.  Menelaus bold\n    Waxed garrulous, and sacked a hundred Troys\n    'Twixt noon and supper.  And her golden voice\n   Got shrill as he grew deafer.  And both were old.\n\n   Often he wonders why on earth he went\n    Troyward, or why poor Paris ever came.\n   Oft she weeps, gummy-eyed and impotent;\n    Her dry shanks twitch at Paris' mumbled name.\n   So Menelaus nagged; and Helen cried;\n   And Paris slept on by Scamander side.\n\n\n\n\nLibido\n\n\n\n   How should I know?  The enormous wheels of will\n    Drove me cold-eyed on tired and sleepless feet.\n   Night was void arms and you a phantom still,\n    And day your far light swaying down the street.\n   As never fool for love, I starved for you;\n    My throat was dry and my eyes hot to see.\n   Your mouth so lying was most heaven in view,\n    And your remembered smell most agony.\n\n   Love wakens love!  I felt your hot wrist shiver\n    And suddenly the mad victory I planned\n     Flashed real, in your burning bending head. . . .\n   My conqueror's blood was cool as a deep river\n    In shadow; and my heart beneath your hand\n     Quieter than a dead man on a bed.\n\n\n\n\nJealousy\n\n\n\n   When I see you, who were so wise and cool,\n   Gazing with silly sickness on that fool\n   You've given your love to, your adoring hands\n   Touch his so intimately that each understands,\n   I know, most hidden things; and when I know\n   Your holiest dreams yield to the stupid bow\n   Of his red lips, and that the empty grace\n   Of those strong legs and arms, that rosy face,\n   Has beaten your heart to such a flame of love,\n   That you have given him every touch and move,\n   Wrinkle and secret of you, all your life,\n   -- Oh! then I know I'm waiting, lover-wife,\n   For the great time when love is at a close,\n   And all its fruit's to watch the thickening nose\n   And sweaty neck and dulling face and eye,\n   That are yours, and you, most surely, till you die!\n   Day after day you'll sit with him and note\n   The greasier tie, the dingy wrinkling coat;\n   As prettiness turns to pomp, and strength to fat,\n   And love, love, love to habit!\n                                   And after that,\n   When all that's fine in man is at an end,\n   And you, that loved young life and clean, must tend\n   A foul sick fumbling dribbling body and old,\n   When his rare lips hang flabby and can't hold\n   Slobber, and you're enduring that worst thing,\n   Senility's queasy furtive love-making,\n   And searching those dear eyes for human meaning,\n   Propping the bald and helpless head, and cleaning\n   A scrap that life's flung by, and love's forgotten, --\n   Then you'll be tired; and passion dead and rotten;\n   And he'll be dirty, dirty!\n                               O lithe and free\n   And lightfoot, that the poor heart cries to see,\n   That's how I'll see your man and you! --\n\n                                             But you\n   -- Oh, when THAT time comes, you'll be dirty too!\n\n\n\n\nBlue Evening\n\n\n\n   My restless blood now lies a-quiver,\n    Knowing that always, exquisitely,\n   This April twilight on the river\n    Stirs anguish in the heart of me.\n\n   For the fast world in that rare glimmer\n    Puts on the witchery of a dream,\n   The straight grey buildings, richly dimmer,\n    The fiery windows, and the stream\n\n   With willows leaning quietly over,\n    The still ecstatic fading skies . . .\n   And all these, like a waiting lover,\n    Murmur and gleam, lift lustrous eyes,\n\n   Drift close to me, and sideways bending\n    Whisper delicious words.\n                              But I\n   Stretch terrible hands, uncomprehending,\n    Shaken with love; and laugh; and cry.\n\n   My agony made the willows quiver;\n    I heard the knocking of my heart\n   Die loudly down the windless river,\n    I heard the pale skies fall apart,\n\n   And the shrill stars' unmeaning laughter,\n    And my voice with the vocal trees\n   Weeping.  And Hatred followed after,\n    Shrilling madly down the breeze.\n\n   In peace from the wild heart of clamour,\n    A flower in moonlight, she was there,\n   Was rippling down white ways of glamour\n    Quietly laid on wave and air.\n\n   Her passing left no leaf a-quiver.\n    Pale flowers wreathed her white, white brows.\n   Her feet were silence on the river;\n    And \"Hush!\" she said, between the boughs.\n\n\n\n\nThe Charm\n\n\n\n   In darkness the loud sea makes moan;\n   And earth is shaken, and all evils creep\n   About her ways.\n                    Oh, now to know you sleep!\n   Out of the whirling blinding moil, alone,\n   Out of the slow grim fight,\n   One thought to wing -- to you, asleep,\n   In some cool room that's open to the night\n   Lying half-forward, breathing quietly,\n   One white hand on the white\n   Unrumpled sheet, and the ever-moving hair\n   Quiet and still at length! . . .\n\n   Your magic and your beauty and your strength,\n   Like hills at noon or sunlight on a tree,\n   Sleeping prevail in earth and air.\n\n   In the sweet gloom above the brown and white\n   Night benedictions hover; and the winds of night\n   Move gently round the room, and watch you there.\n   And through the dreadful hours\n   The trees and waters and the hills have kept\n   The sacred vigil while you slept,\n   And lay a way of dew and flowers\n   Where your feet, your morning feet, shall tread.\n   And still the darkness ebbs about your bed.\n   Quiet, and strange, and loving-kind, you sleep.\n   And holy joy about the earth is shed;\n   And holiness upon the deep.\n\n\n\n\nFinding\n\n\n\n   From the candles and dumb shadows,\n    And the house where love had died,\n   I stole to the vast moonlight\n    And the whispering life outside.\n   But I found no lips of comfort,\n    No home in the moon's light\n   (I, little and lone and frightened\n    In the unfriendly night),\n   And no meaning in the voices. . . .\n    Far over the lands and through\n   The dark, beyond the ocean,\n    I willed to think of YOU!\n   For I knew, had you been with me\n    I'd have known the words of night,\n   Found peace of heart, gone gladly\n    In comfort of that light.\n\n   Oh! the wind with soft beguiling\n    Would have stolen my thought away;\n   And the night, subtly smiling,\n    Came by the silver way;\n   And the moon came down and danced to me,\n    And her robe was white and flying;\n   And trees bent their heads to me\n    Mysteriously crying;\n   And dead voices wept around me;\n    And dead soft fingers thrilled;\n   And the little gods whispered. . . .\n                                         But ever\n    Desperately I willed;\n   Till all grew soft and far\n    And silent . . .\n                      And suddenly\n   I found you white and radiant,\n    Sleeping quietly,\n   Far out through the tides of darkness.\n    And I there in that great light\n   Was alone no more, nor fearful;\n    For there, in the homely night,\n   Was no thought else that mattered,\n    And nothing else was true,\n   But the white fire of moonlight,\n    And a white dream of you.\n\n\n\n\nSong\n\n\n\n   \"Oh! Love,\" they said, \"is King of Kings,\n    And Triumph is his crown.\n   Earth fades in flame before his wings,\n    And Sun and Moon bow down.\" --\n   But that, I knew, would never do;\n    And Heaven is all too high.\n   So whenever I meet a Queen, I said,\n    I will not catch her eye.\n\n   \"Oh! Love,\" they said, and \"Love,\" they said,\n    \"The gift of Love is this;\n   A crown of thorns about thy head,\n    And vinegar to thy kiss!\" --\n   But Tragedy is not for me;\n    And I'm content to be gay.\n   So whenever I spied a Tragic Lady,\n    I went another way.\n\n   And so I never feared to see\n    You wander down the street,\n   Or come across the fields to me\n    On ordinary feet.\n   For what they'd never told me of,\n    And what I never knew;\n   It was that all the time, my love,\n    Love would be merely you.\n\n\n\n\nThe Voice\n\n\n\n   Safe in the magic of my woods\n    I lay, and watched the dying light.\n   Faint in the pale high solitudes,\n    And washed with rain and veiled by night,\n\n   Silver and blue and green were showing.\n    And the dark woods grew darker still;\n   And birds were hushed; and peace was growing;\n    And quietness crept up the hill;\n\n    And no wind was blowing\n\n   And I knew\n   That this was the hour of knowing,\n   And the night and the woods and you\n   Were one together, and I should find\n   Soon in the silence the hidden key\n   Of all that had hurt and puzzled me --\n   Why you were you, and the night was kind,\n   And the woods were part of the heart of me.\n\n   And there I waited breathlessly,\n   Alone; and slowly the holy three,\n   The three that I loved, together grew\n   One, in the hour of knowing,\n   Night, and the woods, and you ----\n\n   And suddenly\n   There was an uproar in my woods,\n\n   The noise of a fool in mock distress,\n   Crashing and laughing and blindly going,\n   Of ignorant feet and a swishing dress,\n   And a Voice profaning the solitudes.\n\n   The spell was broken, the key denied me\n   And at length your flat clear voice beside me\n   Mouthed cheerful clear flat platitudes.\n\n   You came and quacked beside me in the wood.\n   You said, \"The view from here is very good!\"\n   You said, \"It's nice to be alone a bit!\"\n   And, \"How the days are drawing out!\" you said.\n   You said, \"The sunset's pretty, isn't it?\"\n\n        *    *    *    *    *\n\n   By God! I wish -- I wish that you were dead!\n\n\n\n\nDining-Room Tea\n\n\n\n   When you were there, and you, and you,\n   Happiness crowned the night; I too,\n   Laughing and looking, one of all,\n   I watched the quivering lamplight fall\n   On plate and flowers and pouring tea\n   And cup and cloth; and they and we\n   Flung all the dancing moments by\n   With jest and glitter.  Lip and eye\n   Flashed on the glory, shone and cried,\n   Improvident, unmemoried;\n   And fitfully and like a flame\n   The light of laughter went and came.\n   Proud in their careless transience moved\n   The changing faces that I loved.\n\n   Till suddenly, and otherwhence,\n   I looked upon your innocence.\n   For lifted clear and still and strange\n   From the dark woven flow of change\n   Under a vast and starless sky\n   I saw the immortal moment lie.\n   One instant I, an instant, knew\n   As God knows all.  And it and you\n   I, above Time, oh, blind! could see\n   In witless immortality.\n   I saw the marble cup; the tea,\n   Hung on the air, an amber stream;\n   I saw the fire's unglittering gleam,\n   The painted flame, the frozen smoke.\n   No more the flooding lamplight broke\n   On flying eyes and lips and hair;\n   But lay, but slept unbroken there,\n   On stiller flesh, and body breathless,\n   And lips and laughter stayed and deathless,\n   And words on which no silence grew.\n   Light was more alive than you.\n\n   For suddenly, and otherwhence,\n   I looked on your magnificence.\n   I saw the stillness and the light,\n   And you, august, immortal, white,\n   Holy and strange; and every glint\n   Posture and jest and thought and tint\n   Freed from the mask of transiency,\n   Triumphant in eternity,\n   Immote, immortal.\n\n                      Dazed at length\n   Human eyes grew, mortal strength\n   Wearied; and Time began to creep.\n   Change closed about me like a sleep.\n   Light glinted on the eyes I loved.\n   The cup was filled.  The bodies moved.\n   The drifting petal came to ground.\n   The laughter chimed its perfect round.\n   The broken syllable was ended.\n   And I, so certain and so friended,\n   How could I cloud, or how distress,\n   The heaven of your unconsciousness?\n   Or shake at Time's sufficient spell,\n   Stammering of lights unutterable?\n   The eternal holiness of you,\n   The timeless end, you never knew,\n   The peace that lay, the light that shone.\n   You never knew that I had gone\n   A million miles away, and stayed\n   A million years.  The laughter played\n   Unbroken round me; and the jest\n   Flashed on.  And we that knew the best\n   Down wonderful hours grew happier yet.\n   I sang at heart, and talked, and eat,\n   And lived from laugh to laugh, I too,\n   When you were there, and you, and you.\n\n\n\n\nThe Goddess in the Wood\n\n\n\n   In a flowered dell the Lady Venus stood,\n    Amazed with sorrow.  Down the morning one\n    Far golden horn in the gold of trees and sun\n   Rang out; and held; and died. . . .  She thought the wood\n   Grew quieter.  Wing, and leaf, and pool of light\n    Forgot to dance.  Dumb lay the unfalling stream;\n    Life one eternal instant rose in dream\n   Clear out of time, poised on a golden height. . . .\n\n   Till a swift terror broke the abrupt hour.\n   The gold waves purled amidst the green above her;\n    And a bird sang.  With one sharp-taken breath,\n   By sunlit branches and unshaken flower,\n   The immortal limbs flashed to the human lover,\n    And the immortal eyes to look on death.\n\n\n\n\nA Channel Passage\n\n\n\n   The damned ship lurched and slithered.  Quiet and quick\n    My cold gorge rose; the long sea rolled; I knew\n   I must think hard of something, or be sick;\n    And could think hard of only one thing -- YOU!\n   You, you alone could hold my fancy ever!\n    And with you memories come, sharp pain, and dole.\n   Now there's a choice -- heartache or tortured liver!\n    A sea-sick body, or a you-sick soul!\n\n   Do I forget you?  Retchings twist and tie me,\n    Old meat, good meals, brown gobbets, up I throw.\n   Do I remember?  Acrid return and slimy,\n    The sobs and slobber of a last years woe.\n   And still the sick ship rolls.  'Tis hard, I tell ye,\n   To choose 'twixt love and nausea, heart and belly.\n\n\n\n\nVictory\n\n\n\n   All night the ways of Heaven were desolate,\n    Long roads across a gleaming empty sky.\n    Outcast and doomed and driven, you and I,\n   Alone, serene beyond all love or hate,\n   Terror or triumph, were content to wait,\n    We, silent and all-knowing.  Suddenly\n    Swept through the heaven low-crouching from on high,\n   One horseman, downward to the earth's low gate.\n\n   Oh, perfect from the ultimate height of living,\n    Lightly we turned, through wet woods blossom-hung,\n   Into the open.  Down the supernal roads,\n    With plumes a-tossing, purple flags far flung,\n   Rank upon rank, unbridled, unforgiving,\n    Thundered the black battalions of the Gods.\n\n\n\n\nDay and Night\n\n\n\n   Through my heart's palace Thoughts unnumbered throng;\n    And there, most quiet and, as a child, most wise,\n   High-throned you sit, and gracious.  All day long\n    Great Hopes gold-armoured, jester Fantasies,\n    And pilgrim Dreams, and little beggar Sighs,\n   Bow to your benediction, go their way.\n    And the grave jewelled courtier Memories\n   Worship and love and tend you, all the day.\n\n   But when I sleep, and all my thoughts go straying,\n    When the high session of the day is ended,\n   And darkness comes; then, with the waning light,\n    By lilied maidens on your way attended,\n   Proud from the wonted throne, superbly swaying,\n    You, like a queen, pass out into the night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoriambics -- I\n\n\n\n   Ah! not now, when desire burns, and the wind calls, and the suns of spring\n   Light-foot dance in the woods, whisper of life, woo me to wayfaring;\n   Ah! not now should you come, now when the road beckons,\n     and good friends call,\n   Where are songs to be sung, fights to be fought, yea! and the best of all,\n   Love, on myriad lips fairer than yours, kisses you could not give! . . .\n   Dearest, why should I mourn, whimper, and whine, I that have yet to live?\n   Sorrow will I forget, tears for the best, love on the lips of you,\n   Now, when dawn in the blood wakes, and the sun laughs up the eastern blue;\n   I'll forget and be glad!\n                             Only at length, dear, when the great day ends,\n   When love dies with the last light, and the last song has been sung,\n     and friends\n   All are perished, and gloom strides on the heaven:  then, as alone I lie,\n   'Mid Death's gathering winds, frightened and dumb, sick for the past, may I\n   Feel you suddenly there, cool at my brow; then may I hear the peace\n   Of your voice at the last, whispering love, calling, ere all can cease\n   In the silence of death; then may I see dimly, and know, a space,\n   Bending over me, last light in the dark, once, as of old, your face.\n\n\n\n\nChoriambics -- II\n\n\n\n   Here the flame that was ash, shrine that was void,\n     lost in the haunted wood,\n   I have tended and loved, year upon year, I in the solitude\n   Waiting, quiet and glad-eyed in the dark, knowing that once a gleam\n   Glowed and went through the wood.  Still I abode strong in a golden dream,\n   Unrecaptured.\n                  For I, I that had faith, knew that a face would glance\n   One day, white in the dim woods, and a voice call, and a radiance\n   Fill the grove, and the fire suddenly leap . . . and, in the heart of it,\n   End of labouring, you!  Therefore I kept ready the altar, lit\n   The flame, burning apart.\n                              Face of my dreams vainly in vision white\n   Gleaming down to me, lo! hopeless I rise now.  For about midnight\n   Whispers grew through the wood suddenly, strange cries in the boughs above\n   Grated, cries like a laugh.  Silent and black then through the sacred grove\n   Great birds flew, as a dream, troubling the leaves, passing at length.\n                                                                        I knew\n   Long expected and long loved, that afar, God of the dim wood, you\n   Somewhere lay, as a child sleeping, a child suddenly reft from mirth,\n   White and wonderful yet, white in your youth, stretched upon foreign earth,\n   God, immortal and dead!\n                            Therefore I go; never to rest, or win\n   Peace, and worship of you more, and the dumb wood and the shrine therein.\n\n\n\n\nDesertion\n\n\n\n   So light we were, so right we were, so fair faith shone,\n   And the way was laid so certainly, that, when I'd gone,\n   What dumb thing looked up at you?  Was it something heard,\n   Or a sudden cry, that meekly and without a word\n   You broke the faith, and strangely, weakly, slipped apart.\n   You gave in -- you, the proud of heart, unbowed of heart!\n   Was this, friend, the end of all that we could do?\n   And have you found the best for you, the rest for you?\n   Did you learn so suddenly (and I not by!)\n   Some whispered story, that stole the glory from the sky,\n   And ended all the splendid dream, and made you go\n   So dully from the fight we know, the light we know?\n\n   O faithless! the faith remains, and I must pass\n   Gay down the way, and on alone.  Under the grass\n   You wait; the breeze moves in the trees, and stirs, and calls,\n   And covers you with white petals, with light petals.\n   There it shall crumble, frail and fair, under the sun,\n   O little heart, your brittle heart; till day be done,\n   And the shadows gather, falling light, and, white with dew,\n   Whisper, and weep; and creep to you.  Good sleep to you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1914\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI.  Peace\n\n\n\n   Now, God be thanked Who has matched us with His hour,\n    And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping,\n   With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,\n    To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping,\n   Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary,\n    Leave the sick hearts that honour could not move,\n   And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary,\n    And all the little emptiness of love!\n\n   Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there,\n    Where there's no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending,\n     Naught broken save this body, lost but breath;\n   Nothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there\n    But only agony, and that has ending;\n     And the worst friend and enemy is but Death.\n\n\n\n\nII.  Safety\n\n\n\n   Dear! of all happy in the hour, most blest\n    He who has found our hid security,\n   Assured in the dark tides of the world that rest,\n    And heard our word, 'Who is so safe as we?'\n   We have found safety with all things undying,\n    The winds, and morning, tears of men and mirth,\n   The deep night, and birds singing, and clouds flying,\n    And sleep, and freedom, and the autumnal earth.\n   We have built a house that is not for Time's throwing.\n    We have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever.\n   War knows no power.  Safe shall be my going,\n    Secretly armed against all death's endeavour;\n   Safe though all safety's lost; safe where men fall;\n   And if these poor limbs die, safest of all.\n\n\n\n\nIII.  The Dead\n\n\n\n   Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead!\n    There's none of these so lonely and poor of old,\n    But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold.\n   These laid the world away; poured out the red\n   Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be\n    Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene,\n    That men call age; and those who would have been,\n   Their sons, they gave, their immortality.\n\n   Blow, bugles, blow!  They brought us, for our dearth,\n    Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain.\n   Honour has come back, as a king, to earth,\n    And paid his subjects with a royal wage;\n   And Nobleness walks in our ways again;\n    And we have come into our heritage.\n\n\n\n\nIV.  The Dead\n\n\n\n   These hearts were woven of human joys and cares,\n    Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth.\n   The years had given them kindness.  Dawn was theirs,\n    And sunset, and the colours of the earth.\n   These had seen movement, and heard music; known\n    Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended;\n   Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone;\n    Touched flowers and furs and cheeks.  All this is ended.\n\n   There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter\n   And lit by the rich skies, all day.  And after,\n    Frost, with a gesture, stays the waves that dance\n   And wandering loveliness.  He leaves a white\n    Unbroken glory, a gathered radiance,\n   A width, a shining peace, under the night.\n\n\n\n\nV.  The Soldier\n\n\n\n   If I should die, think only this of me:\n    That there's some corner of a foreign field\n   That is for ever England.

We are alone.\n\n\n\n\nSong\n\n\n\n   All suddenly the wind comes soft,\n    And Spring is here again;\n   And the hawthorn quickens with buds of green,\n    And my heart with buds of pain.\n\n   My heart all Winter lay so numb,\n    The earth so dead and frore,\n   That I never thought the Spring would come,\n    Or my heart wake any more.\n\n   But Winter's broken and earth has woken,\n    And the small birds cry again;\n   And the hawthorn hedge puts forth its buds,\n    And my heart puts forth its pain.\n\n\n\n\nBeauty and Beauty\n\n\n\n   When Beauty and Beauty meet\n    All naked, fair to fair,\n   The earth is crying-sweet,\n    And scattering-bright the air,\n   Eddying, dizzying, closing round,\n    With soft and drunken laughter;\n   Veiling all that may befall\n    After -- after --\n\n   Where Beauty and Beauty met,\n    Earth's still a-tremble there,\n   And winds are scented yet,\n    And memory-soft the air,\n   Bosoming, folding glints of light,\n    And shreds of shadowy laughter;\n   Not the tears that fill the years\n    After -- after --\n\n\n\n\nThe Way That Lovers Use\n\n\n\n   The way that lovers use is this;\n    They bow, catch hands, with never a word,\n   And their lips meet, and they do kiss,\n    -- So I have heard.\n\n   They queerly find some healing so,\n    And strange attainment in the touch;\n   There is a secret lovers know,\n    -- I have read as much.\n\n   And theirs no longer joy nor smart,\n    Changing or ending, night or day;\n   But mouth to mouth, and heart on heart,\n    -- So lovers say.\n\n\n\n\nMary and Gabriel\n\n\n\n   Young Mary, loitering once her garden way,\n   Felt a warm splendour grow in the April day,\n   As wine that blushes water through.  And soon,\n   Out of the gold air of the afternoon,\n   One knelt before her:  hair he had, or fire,\n   Bound back above his ears with golden wire,\n   Baring the eager marble of his face.\n   Not man's nor woman's was the immortal grace\n   Rounding the limbs beneath that robe of white,\n   And lighting the proud eyes with changeless light,\n   Incurious.  Calm as his wings, and fair,\n   That presence filled the garden.\n                                     She stood there,\n   Saying, \"What would you, Sir?\"\n                                   He told his word,\n   \"Blessed art thou of women!\"  Half she heard,\n   Hands folded and face bowed, half long had known,\n   The message of that clear and holy tone,\n   That fluttered hot sweet sobs about her heart;\n   Such serene tidings moved such human smart.\n   Her breath came quick as little flakes of snow.\n   Her hands crept up her breast.  She did but know\n   It was not hers.  She felt a trembling stir\n   Within her body, a will too strong for her\n   That held and filled and mastered all.  With eyes\n   Closed, and a thousand soft short broken sighs,\n   She gave submission; fearful, meek, and glad. . . .\n\n   She wished to speak.  Under her breasts she had\n   Such multitudinous burnings, to and fro,\n   And throbs not understood; she did not know\n   If they were hurt or joy for her; but only\n   That she was grown strange to herself, half lonely,\n   All wonderful, filled full of pains to come\n   And thoughts she dare not think, swift thoughts and dumb,\n   Human, and quaint, her own, yet very far,\n   Divine, dear, terrible, familiar . . .\n   Her heart was faint for telling; to relate\n   Her limbs' sweet treachery, her strange high estate,\n   Over and over, whispering, half revealing,\n   Weeping; and so find kindness to her healing.\n   'Twixt tears and laughter, panic hurrying her,\n   She raised her eyes to that fair messenger.\n   He knelt unmoved, immortal; with his eyes\n   Gazing beyond her, calm to the calm skies;\n   Radiant, untroubled in his wisdom, kind.\n   His sheaf of lilies stirred not in the wind.\n   How should she, pitiful with mortality,\n   Try the wide peace of that felicity\n   With ripples of her perplexed shaken heart,\n   And hints of human ecstasy, human smart,\n   And whispers of the lonely weight she bore,\n   And how her womb within was hers no more\n   And at length hers?\n                        Being tired, she bowed her head;\n   And said, \"So be it!\"\n                          The great wings were spread\n   Showering glory on the fields, and fire.\n   The whole air, singing, bore him up, and higher,\n   Unswerving, unreluctant.  Soon he shone\n   A gold speck in the gold skies; then was gone.\n\n   The air was colder, and grey.  She stood alone.\n\n\n\n\nThe Funeral of Youth:  Threnody\n\n\n\n   The day that YOUTH had died,\n   There came to his grave-side,\n   In decent mourning, from the country's ends,\n   Those scatter'd friends\n   Who had lived the boon companions of his prime,\n   And laughed with him and sung with him and wasted,\n   In feast and wine and many-crown'd carouse,\n   The days and nights and dawnings of the time\n   When YOUTH kept open house,\n   Nor left untasted\n   Aught of his high emprise and ventures dear,\n   No quest of his unshar'd --\n   All these, with loitering feet and sad head bar'd,\n   Followed their old friend's bier.\n   FOLLY went first,\n   With muffled bells and coxcomb still revers'd;\n   And after trod the bearers, hat in hand --\n   LAUGHTER, most hoarse, and Captain PRIDE with tanned\n   And martial face all grim, and fussy JOY,\n   Who had to catch a train, and LUST, poor, snivelling boy;\n   These bore the dear departed.\n   Behind them, broken-hearted,\n   Came GRIEF, so noisy a widow, that all said,\n   \"Had he but wed\n   Her elder sister SORROW, in her stead!\"\n   And by her, trying to soothe her all the time,\n   The fatherless children, COLOUR, TUNE, and RHYME\n   (The sweet lad RHYME), ran all-uncomprehending.\n   Then, at the way's sad ending,\n   Round the raw grave they stay'd.  Old WISDOM read,\n   In mumbling tone, the Service for the Dead.\n   There stood ROMANCE,\n   The furrowing tears had mark'd her rouged cheek;\n   Poor old CONCEIT, his wonder unassuaged;\n   Dead INNOCENCY's daughter, IGNORANCE;\n   And shabby, ill-dress'd GENEROSITY;\n   And ARGUMENT, too full of woe to speak;\n   PASSION, grown portly, something middle-aged;\n   And FRIENDSHIP -- not a minute older, she;\n   IMPATIENCE, ever taking out his watch;\n   FAITH, who was deaf, and had to lean, to catch\n   Old WISDOM's endless drone.\n   BEAUTY was there,\n   Pale in her black; dry-eyed; she stood alone.\n   Poor maz'd IMAGINATION; FANCY wild;\n   ARDOUR, the sunlight on his greying hair;\n   CONTENTMENT, who had known YOUTH as a child\n   And never seen him since.  And SPRING came too,\n   Dancing over the tombs, and brought him flowers --\n   She did not stay for long.\n   And TRUTH, and GRACE, and all the merry crew,\n   The laughing WINDS and RIVERS, and lithe HOURS;\n   And HOPE, the dewy-eyed; and sorrowing SONG; --\n   Yes, with much woe and mourning general,\n   At dead YOUTH's funeral,\n   Even these were met once more together, all,\n   Who erst the fair and living YOUTH did know;\n   All, except only LOVE.  LOVE had died long ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrantchester\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Old Vicarage, Grantchester\n\n   (Cafe des Westens, Berlin, May 1912)\n\n\n\n   Just now the lilac is in bloom,\n   All before my little room;\n   And in my flower-beds, I think,\n   Smile the carnation and the pink;\n   And down the borders, well I know,\n   The poppy and the pansy blow . . .\n   Oh! there the chestnuts, summer through,\n   Beside the river make for you\n   A tunnel of green gloom, and sleep\n   Deeply above; and green and deep\n   The stream mysterious glides beneath,\n   Green as a dream and deep as death.\n   -- Oh, damn!

Two of these, the\n\"Letter to a Live Poet\" and \"The Little Dog's Day,\" were written for\nWestminster Gazette competitions, in which they won prizes.

Still\n   No one could see me.\n\n                 I would have thought of them\n   --Heedless, within a week of battle--in pity,\n   Pride in their strength and in the weight and firmness\n   And link'd beauty of bodies, and pity that\n   This gay machine of splendour 'ld soon be broken,\n   Thought little of, pashed, scattered, . . .\n\n                                        Only, always,\n   I could but see them--against the lamplight--pass\n   Like coloured shadows, thinner than filmy glass,\n   Slight bubbles, fainter than the wave's faint light,\n   That broke to phosphorus out in the night,\n   Perishing things and strange ghosts--soon to die\n   To other ghosts--this one, or that or I.\n\n   April 1915.\n\n\n\nThe Dance\n\n                 A Song\n\n   As the Wind, and as the Wind,\n       In a corner of the way,\n   Goes stepping, stands twirling,\n   Invisibly, comes whirling,\n   Bows before, and skips behind,\n     In a grave, an endless play--\n\n   So my Heart, and so my Heart,\n       Following where your feet have gone,\n   Stirs dust of old dreams there;\n   He turns a toe; he gleams there,\n   Treading you a dance apart.\n     But you see not.

Ears satiate\n   With the clamorous, timorous whisperings of to-day,\n   Thrilled to perceive once more the spacious voice\n   And serene utterance of old.

Though he afterwards dropped both these games,\nhe developed as a sound tennis player, was a great walker, and found joy\nin swimming, like Byron and Swinburne, especially by night.  He delighted\nin the Russian ballet and went again and again to a good Revue.\n\nIn 1906 he went up to King's College, Cambridge, where he made\ninnumerable friends, and was considered one of the leading intellectuals\nof his day, among his peers being James Elroy Flecker,\nhimself a poet of no small achievement, who died at Davos\nonly a few months ago.  Mr. Ivan Lake, the editor of the 'Bodleian',\na contemporary at Cambridge, tells me that although the two men\nmoved in different sets, they frequented the same literary circles.\nBrooke, however, seldom, if ever, spoke at the Union,\nbut was a member of the Cambridge Fabian Society, and held the posts\nof Secretary and President in turn.  His socialism was accompanied by\na passing phase of vegetarianism, and with the ferment of youth\nworking headily within him he could hardly escape the charge\nof being a crank, but \"a crank, if a little thing, makes revolutions,\"\nand Brooke's youthful extravagances were utterly untinged with decadence.\nHe took his classical tripos in 1909, and after spending some time\nas a student in Munich, returned to live near Cambridge\nat the Old Vicarage in \"the lovely hamlet, Grantchester.\"  \"It was there,\"\nwrites Mr. Raglan H. E. H. Somerset in a letter I am privileged to quote,\n\"that I used to wake him on Sunday mornings to bathe in the dam\nabove Byron's Pool.  His bedroom was always littered with books,\nEnglish, French, and German, in wild disorder.  About his bathing\none thing stands out; time after time he would try to dive;\nhe always failed and came absolutely flat, but seemed to like it,\nalthough it must have hurt excessively.\"  (This was only\nwhen he was learning.  Later he became an accomplished diver.)\n\"Then we used to go back and feed, sometimes in the Orchard and sometimes\nin the Old Vicarage Garden, on eggs and that particular brand of honey\nreferred to in the 'Grantchester' poem.  In those days he always dressed\nin the same way:  cricket shirt and trousers and no stockings; in fact,\n'Rupert's mobile toes' were a subject for the admiration of his friends.\"\n\nBrooke occupied himself mainly with writing.  Poems, remarkable for\na happy spontaneity such as characterized the work of T. E. Brown,\nthe Manx poet, appeared in the 'Gownsman', the 'Cambridge Review',\nthe 'Nation', the 'English Review', and the 'Westminster Gazette'.\nStudents of the \"Problem Page\" in the 'Saturday Westminster'\nknew him as a brilliant competitor who infused the purely academic\nwith the very spirit of youth.\n\nTo all who knew him, the man himself was at least as important as his work.\n\"As to his talk\" -- I quote again from Mr. Somerset --\n\"he was a spendthrift.  I mean that he never saved anything up\nas those writer fellows so often do.  He was quite inconsequent\nand just rippled on, but was always ready to attack a careless thinker.\nOn the other hand, he was extremely tolerant of fools, even bad poets\nwho are the worst kind of fools -- or rather the hardest to bear --\nbut that was kindness of heart.\"\n\nOf his personal appearance a good deal has been said.  \"One who knew him,\"\nwriting in one of the daily papers, said that \"to look at, he was part\nof the youth of the world.  He was one of the handsomest Englishmen\nof his time.  His moods seemed to be merely a disguise for the radiance\nof an early summer's day.\"\n\nMr. Edward Thomas speaks of him as \"a golden young Apollo\"\nwho made friends, admirers, adorers, wherever he went.\n\"He stretched himself out, drew his fingers through his waved fair hair,\nlaughed, talked indolently, and admired as much as he was admired. . . .\nHe was tall, broad, and easy in his movements.  Either he stooped,\nor he thrust his head forward unusually much to look at you\nwith his steady blue eyes.\"\n\nOn Mr. H. W. Nevinson, who, in a fleeting editorial capacity, sent for\nBrooke to come and discuss his poems, he made a similar impression:\n\n\"Suddenly he came -- an astonishing apparition in any newspaper office:\nloose hair of deep, browny-gold; smooth, ruddy face;\neyes not gray or bluish-white, but of living blue, really like the sky,\nand as frankly open; figure not very tall, but firm and strongly made,\ngiving the sense of weight rather than of speed and yet\nso finely fashioned and healthy that it was impossible not to think\nof the line about 'a pard-like spirit'.  He was dressed\njust in the ordinary way, except that he wore a low blue collar,\nand blue shirt and tie, all uncommon in those days.\nEvidently he did not want to be conspicuous, but the whole effect\nwas almost ludicrously beautiful.\"\n\nNotions of height are always comparative, and it will be noticed\nthat Mr. Nevinson and Mr. Thomas differ in their ideas.\nMr. Edward Marsh, however, Brooke's executor and one of his\nclosest friends -- indeed the friend of all young poets --\ntells me that he was about six feet, so that all doubt on this minor point\nmay be set at rest.\n\nHe had been in Munich, Berlin, and in Italy, and in May, 1913,\nhe left England again for a wander year, passing through\nthe United States and Canada on his way to the South Seas.\nPerhaps some of those who met him in Boston and elsewhere\nwill some day contribute their quota to the bright record of his life.\nHis own letters to the 'Westminster Gazette', though naturally\nof unequal merit, were full of humorous delight in the New World.\nIn one of his travel papers he described the city of Quebec as having\n\"the radiance and repose of an immortal.\"  \"That, in so many words,\"\nwrote Mr. Walter de la Mare, \"brings back his living remembrance. . . .\nWith him there was a happy shining impression that he might have just come\n-- that very moment -- from another planet, one well within\nthe solar system, but a little more like Utopia than ours.\"\nNot even Stevenson, it would seem, excited a greater enthusiasm\namong his friends; and between the two men an interesting parallel\nmight be drawn.  Brooke made a pilgrimage to Stevenson's home in Samoa,\nand his life in the Pacific found full and happy expression in his verse.\nHis thoughts, however, turned longingly to England,\nthe land \"where Men with Splendid Hearts may go,\" and he reappeared\nfrom the ends of the earth among his friends as apparently little changed\n\"as one who gaily and laughingly goes to bed and gaily and laughingly\ncomes down next morning after a perfectly refreshing sleep.\"\n\nThen came the War.  \"Well, if Armageddon's ON,\" he said,\n\"I suppose one should be there.\"  It was a characteristic way\nof putting it.  He obtained a commission in the Hood Battalion\nof the Royal Naval Division in September, and was quickly ordered\non the disastrous if heroic expedition to Antwerp.  Here he had\nhis first experience of war, lying for some days in trenches\nshelled by the distant German guns.  Then followed a strange retreat\nby night along roads lit by the glare of burning towns,\nand swarming with pitiful crowds of Belgian refugees.\nYet as Mr. Walter de la Mare said of him, when he returned from Antwerp,\n\"Ulysses himself at the end of his voyagings was not more quietly\naccustomed to the shocks of novelty.\"\n\nOn Brooke, as on many other young men, to whom the gift of self-expression\nhas perhaps been denied, the war had a swiftly maturing influence.\nMuch of the impetuosity of youth fell away from him.  The boy who had been\nrather proud of his independent views -- a friend relates how\nat the age of twelve he sat on the platform at a pro-Boer meeting --\ngrew suddenly, it seemed, into a man filled with the love of life indeed,\nbut inspired most of all with the love of England.  Fortunately for himself\nand for us, Brooke's patriotism found passionate voice in the sonnets\nwhich are rightly given pride of place in the 1914 section of this volume.\nMr. Clement Shorter, who gives us the skeleton of a bibliography\nthat is all too brief, draws special attention to 'New Numbers',\na quarterly publication issued in Gloucestershire,\nto which Brooke contributed in February, April, August, and December\nof last year, his fellow poets being Lascelles Abercrombie,\nJohn Drinkwater, and Wilfrid Wilson Gibson.  He spent the winter\nin training at Blandford Camp in Dorsetshire, and sailed with\nthe British Mediterranean Expeditionary Force on the last day of February.\nHe had a presentiment of his death, but he went, as so many others\nhave gone,\n\n    \"Unstumbling, unreluctant, strong, unknowing,\n     Borne by a will not his, that lifts, that grows,\n    Sweeps out to darkness, triumphing in his goal,\n     Out of the fire, out of the little room. . . .\n    -- There is an end appointed, O my soul!\"\n\nHe never reached the Dardanelles.  He went first to Lemnos\nand then to Egypt.  Early in April he had a touch of sunstroke\nfrom which he recovered; but he died from blood-poisoning on board\na French hospital ship at Scyros on Friday, April 23rd -- died for England\non the day of St. Michael and Saint George.  He was buried at night,\nby torchlight, in an olive grove about a mile inland.  \"If you go there,\"\nwrites Mr. Stephen Graham, \"you will find a little wooden cross\nwith just his name and the date of his birth and his death marked on it\nin black.\"  A few days later the news of his death was published\nin the 'Times' with the following appreciation:\n\n\"W. S. C.\" writes:  \"Rupert Brooke is dead.  A telegram from the Admiral\nat Lemnos tells us that this life has closed at the moment when it seemed\nto have reached its springtime.  A voice had become audible,\na note had been struck, more true, more thrilling, more able to do justice\nto the nobility of our youth in arms engaged in this present war,\nthan any other -- more able to express their thoughts of self-surrender,\nand with a power to carry comfort to those who watch them so intently\nfrom afar.  The voice has been swiftly stilled.  Only the echoes\nand the memory remain; but they will linger.\n\n\"During the last few months of his life, months of preparation\nin gallant comradeship and open air, the poet-soldier told\nwith all the simple force of genius the sorrow of youth about to die,\nand the sure, triumphant consolations of a sincere and valiant spirit.\nHe expected to die; he was willing to die for the dear England\nwhose beauty and majesty he knew; and he advanced toward the brink\nin perfect serenity, with absolute conviction of the rightness\nof his country's cause and a heart devoid of hate for fellowmen.\n\n\"The thoughts to which he gave expression in the very few incomparable\nwar sonnets which he has left behind will be shared by many thousands\nof young men moving resolutely and blithely forward into this, the hardest,\nthe cruellest, and the least-rewarded of all the wars that men have fought.\nThey are a whole history and revelation of Rupert Brooke himself.\nJoyous, fearless, versatile, deeply instructed, with classic symmetry\nof mind and body, ruled by high, undoubting purpose, he was all\nthat one would wish England's noblest sons to be in days when no sacrifice\nbut the most precious is acceptable, and the most precious is that\nwhich is most freely proffered.\"\n\n\"W. S. C.\", as many probably guessed at the time, was the Rt. Hon.\nWinston Spencer Churchill, a personal friend and warm admirer of the poet.\nMany other tributes followed, notably from an anonymous writer\nin the 'Spectator', from Mr. Walter de la Mare, Mr. Edward Thomas,\nMr. Holbrook Jackson, Mr. Jack Collings Squire, Mr. James Douglas,\nMr. Drinkwater, Mr. Gibson, and Mr. Lascelles Abercrombie.\nFrom most of these writers I have already quoted at some length,\nbut space must yet be found for the last three, the surviving members\nof the brilliant quartette who produced 'New Numbers'.  Mr. Drinkwater\nwrote as follows:  \"There can have been no man of his years in England\nwho had at once so impressive a personality and so inevitable an appeal\nto the affection of every one who knew him, while there has not been,\nI think, so grievous a loss to poetry since the death of Shelley.\nSome of us who knew him may live to be old men, but life is not likely\nto give us any richer memory than his; and the passion and shapely zest\nthat are in his work will pass safely to the memory of posterity.\"\nMr. Wilfrid Gibson's tribute took the form of a short poem\ncalled \"The Going\":\n\n    He's gone.\n    I do not understand.\n    I only know\n    That, as he turned to go\n    And waved his hand,\n    In his young eyes a sudden glory shone,\n    And I was dazzled by a sunset glow --\n    And he was gone.\n\nMr. Lascelles Abercrombie, now perhaps the greatest of our younger poets\nand a warm personal friend of Brooke's, wrote at greater length:\n\n\"'And the worst friend and enemy is but Death' . . .  'And if these\npoor limbs die, safest of all.'  So ended two of the five sonnets,\nwith the common title '1914', which Rupert Brooke wrote\nwhile he was in training, between the Antwerp expedition and sailing\nfor the Aegean.  These sonnets are incomparably the finest utterance\nof English poetry concerning the Great War.  We knew the splendid promise\nof Rupert Brooke's earlier poetry; these sonnets are the brief perfection\nof his achievement.  They are much more than that:  they are among\nthe few supreme utterances of English patriotism.  It was natural, perhaps,\nthat they should leave all else that has been written about the war\nso far behind.  It is not so much that they are the work of a talent\nscarcely, in its own way, to be equalled to-day; it was much more\nthat they were the work of a poet who had for his material the feeling\nthat he was giving up everything to fight for England --\nthe feeling, I think, that he was giving his life for England.\nReading these five sonnets now, it seems as if he had in them written\nhis own epitaph.  I believe he thought so himself; a few words he said\nin my last talk with him makes me believe that -- now.  At any rate,\nthe history of literature, so full of Fate's exquisite ironies,\nhas nothing more poignantly ironic, and nothing at the same time\nmore beautifully appropriate, than the publication of Rupert Brooke's\nnoble sonnet-sequence, '1914', a few swift weeks before the death\nthey had imagined, and had already made lovely.  Each one of these\nfive sonnets faces, in a quiet exultation, the thought of death,\nof death for England; and understands, as seldom even English poetry\nhas understood, the unspeakable beauty of the thought:\n\n    \"These laid the world away; poured out the red\n    Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be\n     Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene\n     That men call age; and those who would have been,\n    Their sons, they gave -- their immortality.\n\nI am strangely mistaken if the accent of the noblest English poetry\ndoes not speak to us in those lines.  And again:\n\n    \"If I should die, think only this of me:\n     That there's some corner of a foreign field\n    That is for ever England.  There shall be\n     In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;\n    A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,\n     Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,\n    A body of England's breathing, breathing English air,\n     Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.\n\n\"This -- this music, this beauty, this courage -- was Rupert Brooke.\nBut it is, we may be sure, his immortality.  It is not yet tolerable\nto speak of personal loss.  The name seemed to stand for a magical vitality\nthat must be safe -- safe!  Yes, 'and if these poor limbs die,\nsafest of all!'  What poetry has lost in him cannot be judged by any one\nwho has not read those last sonnets, now his farewell to England\nand the world.  I am not underrating the rest of his work.\nThere was an intellectual keenness and brightness in it, a fire of imagery\nand (in the best sense) wit, the like of which had not been known,\nor known only in snatches, in our literature since the best days of\nthe later Elizabethans.  And it was all penetrated by a mastering passion,\nthe most elemental of all passions -- the passion for life.\n'I have been so great a lover,' he cries, and artfully leads us on\nto think he means the usual passion of a young poet's career.\nBut it is just life he loves, and not in any abstract sense,\nbut all the infinite little familiar details of life catalogued\nwith delighted jest.  This was profoundly sincere:  no one ever loved life\nmore wholly or more minutely.  And he celebrated his love exquisitely,\noften unforgettably, through all his earlier poetry,\ngetting further intensity from a long sojourn in the South Seas.\nBut this passion for life had never had seriously to fight for\nits rights and joys.  Like all great lovers of life, he had pleased himself\nwith the thought of death and after death:  not insincerely, by any means,\nbut simply because this gave a finer relish to the sense of being alive.\nPlatonism, which offers delightful games for such subtle wit as his,\nhe especially liked to play with.  It was one more element in the life\nof here and now, the life of mortal thought and sense and spirit,\ninfinitely varying and by him infinitely loved.  And then came 1914;\nand his passion for life had suddenly to face the thought\nof voluntary death.  But there was no struggle; for instantly\nthe passion for life became one with the will to die --\nand now it has become death itself.  But first Rupert Brooke\nhad told the world once more how the passion for beautiful life\nmay reach its highest passion and most radiant beauty when it is\nthe determination to die.\"\n\n\n                                                        Margaret Lavington.\n\nLondon, October, 1915.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddendum\n\nComprised of poems written in his memory by three poets contemporary\nto Rupert Brooke.  A short poem by Mr. Gibson is already included\nin the Biographical Note; a set of four of his sonnets is included here.\nThe poems are Public Domain.\n\n\n\n\nIn Memory of Rupert Brooke\n\n\n\n   In alien earth, across a troubled sea,\n    His body lies that was so fair and young.\n    His mouth is stopped, with half his songs unsung;\n   His arm is still, that struck to make men free.\n   But let no cloud of lamentation be\n    Where, on a warrior's grave, a lyre is hung.\n    We keep the echoes of his golden tongue,\n   We keep the vision of his chivalry.\n\n   So Israel's joy, the loveliest of kings,\n    Smote now his harp, and now the hostile horde.\n   To-day the starry roof of Heaven rings\n    With psalms a soldier made to praise his Lord;\n   And David rests beneath Eternal wings,\n    Song on his lips, and in his hand a sword.\n\n    --Joyce Kilmer, from 'Main Street and Other Poems', 1917.\n\n\n\n\nRupert Brooke\n\n\n\n     I\n\n   Your face was lifted to the golden sky\n    Ablaze beyond the black roofs of the square\n    As flame on flame leapt, flourishing in air\n   Its tumult of red stars exultantly\n   To the cold constellations dim and high:\n    And as we neared the roaring ruddy flare\n    Kindled to gold your throat and brow and hair\n   Until you burned, a flame of ecstasy.\n\n   The golden head goes down into the night\n    Quenched in cold gloom -- and yet again you stand\n   Beside me now with lifted face alight,\n   As, flame to flame, and fire to fire you burn . . .\n   Then, recollecting, laughingly you turn,\n    And look into my eyes and take my hand.\n\n\n     II\n\n   Once in my garret -- you being far away\n    Tramping the hills and breathing upland air,\n    Or so I fancied -- brooding in my chair,\n   I watched the London sunshine feeble and grey\n   Dapple my desk, too tired to labour more,\n    When, looking up, I saw you standing there\n    Although I'd caught no footstep on the stair,\n   Like sudden April at my open door.\n\n   Though now beyond earth's farthest hills you fare,\n    Song-crowned, immortal, sometimes it seems to me\n    That, if I listen very quietly,\n   Perhaps I'll hear a light foot on the stair\n   And see you, standing with your angel air,\n    Fresh from the uplands of eternity.\n\n\n     III\n\n   Your eyes rejoiced in colour's ecstasy,\n    Fulfilling even their uttermost desire,\n    When, over a great sunlit field afire\n   With windy poppies streaming like a sea\n   Of scarlet flame that flaunted riotously\n    Among green orchards of that western shire,\n    You gazed as though your heart could never tire\n   Of life's red flood in summer revelry.\n\n   And as I watched you, little thought had I\n   How soon beneath the dim low-drifting sky\n    Your soul should wander down the darkling way,\n   With eyes that peer a little wistfully,\n   Half-glad, half-sad, remembering, as they see\n    Lethean poppies, shrivelling ashen grey.\n\n\n     IV\n\n   October chestnuts showered their perishing gold\n    Over us as beside the stream we lay\n    In the Old Vicarage garden that blue day,\n   Talking of verse and all the manifold\n   Delights a little net of words may hold,\n    While in the sunlight water-voles at play\n    Dived under a trailing crimson bramble-spray,\n   And walnuts thudded ripe on soft black mould.\n\n   Your soul goes down unto a darker stream\n    Alone, O friend, yet even in death's deep night\n       Your eyes may grow accustomed to the dark\n   And Styx for you may have the ripple and gleam\n       Of your familiar river, and Charon's bark\n    Tarry by that old garden of your delight.\n\n    --Wilfrid Wilson Gibson, 1916.\n\n\n\n\nTo Rupert Brooke\n\n\n\n   Though we, a happy few,\n   Indubitably knew\n   That from the purple came\n   This poet of pure flame,\n\n   The world first saw his light\n   Flash on an evil night,\n   And heard his song from far\n   Above the drone of war.\n\n   Out of the primal dark\n   He leapt, like lyric lark,\n   Singing his aubade strain;\n   Then fell to earth again.\n\n   We garner all he gave,\n   And on his hero grave,\n   For love and honour strew,\n   Rosemary, myrtle, rue.\n\n   Son of the Morning, we\n   Had kept you thankfully;\n   But yours the asphodel:\n   Hail, singer, and farewell!\n\n   --Eden Phillpotts, from 'Plain Song, 1914-1916'."
