C._]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I—A TALE OF A LION RAMPANT\n\n\nIt was in the month of May 1813 that I was so unlucky as to fall at last\ninto the hands of the enemy.  My knowledge of the English language had\nmarked me out for a certain employment.  Though I cannot conceive a\nsoldier refusing to incur the risk, yet to be hanged for a spy is a\ndisgusting business; and I was relieved to be held a prisoner of war.\nInto the Castle of Edinburgh, standing in the midst of that city on the\nsummit of an extraordinary rock, I was cast with several hundred\nfellow-sufferers, all privates like myself, and the more part of them, by\nan accident, very ignorant, plain fellows.  My English, which had brought\nme into that scrape, now helped me very materially to bear it.  I had a\nthousand advantages.  I was often called to play the part of an\ninterpreter, whether of orders or complaints, and thus brought in\nrelations, sometimes of mirth, sometimes almost of friendship, with the\nofficers in charge.  A young lieutenant singled me out to be his\nadversary at chess, a game in which I was extremely proficient, and would\nreward me for my gambits with excellent cigars.  The major of the\nbattalion took lessons of French from me while at breakfast, and was\nsometimes so obliging as to have me join him at the meal.  Chevenix was\nhis name.  He was stiff as a drum-major and selfish as an Englishman, but\na fairly conscientious pupil and a fairly upright man.  Little did I\nsuppose that his ramrod body and frozen face would, in the end, step in\nbetween me and all my dearest wishes; that upon this precise, regular,\nicy soldier-man my fortunes should so nearly shipwreck!  I never liked,\nbut yet I trusted him; and though it may seem but a trifle, I found his\nsnuff-box with the bean in it come very welcome.\n\nFor it is strange how grown men and seasoned soldiers can go back in\nlife; so that after but a little while in prison, which is after all the\nnext thing to being in the nursery, they grow absorbed in the most\npitiful, childish interests, and a sugar biscuit or a pinch of snuff\nbecome things to follow after and scheme for!\n\nWe made but a poor show of prisoners.  The officers had been all offered\ntheir parole, and had taken it.  They lived mostly in suburbs of the\ncity, lodging with modest families, and enjoyed their freedom and\nsupported the almost continual evil tidings of the Emperor as best they\nmight.  It chanced I was the only gentleman among the privates who\nremained.  A great part were ignorant Italians, of a regiment that had\nsuffered heavily in Catalonia.  The rest were mere diggers of the soil,\ntreaders of grapes or hewers of wood, who had been suddenly and violently\npreferred to the glorious state of soldiers.  We had but the one interest\nin common: each of us who had any skill with his fingers passed the hours\nof his captivity in the making of little toys and _articles of Paris_;\nand the prison was daily visited at certain hours by a concourse of\npeople of the country, come to exult over our distress, or—it is more\ntolerant to suppose—their own vicarious triumph.  Some moved among us\nwith a decency of shame or sympathy.  Others were the most offensive\npersonages in the world, gaped at us as if we had been baboons, sought to\nevangelise us to their rustic, northern religion, as though we had been\nsavages, or tortured us with intelligence of disasters to the arms of\nFrance.  Good, bad, and indifferent, there was one alleviation to the\nannoyance of these visitors; for it was the practice of almost all to\npurchase some specimen of our rude handiwork.  This led, amongst the\nprisoners, to a strong spirit of competition.  Some were neat of hand,\nand (the genius of the French being always distinguished) could place\nupon sale little miracles of dexterity and taste.  Some had a more\nengaging appearance; fine features were found to do as well as fine\nmerchandise, and an air of youth in particular (as it appealed to the\nsentiment of pity in our visitors) to be a source of profit.  Others\nagain enjoyed some acquaintance with the language, and were able to\nrecommend the more agreeably to purchasers such trifles as they had to\nsell.  To the first of these advantages I could lay no claim, for my\nfingers were all thumbs.  Some at least of the others I possessed; and\nfinding much entertainment in our commerce, I did not suffer my\nadvantages to rust.  I have never despised the social arts, in which it\nis a national boast that every Frenchman should excel.  For the approach\nof particular sorts of visitors, I had a particular manner of address,\nand even of appearance, which I could readily assume and change on the\noccasion rising.  I never lost an opportunity to flatter either the\nperson of my visitor, if it should be a lady, or, if it should be a man,\nthe greatness of his country in war.  And in case my compliments should\nmiss their aim, I was always ready to cover my retreat with some\nagreeable pleasantry, which would often earn me the name of an ‘oddity’\nor a ‘droll fellow.’  In this way, although I was so left-handed a\ntoy-maker, I made out to be rather a successful merchant; and found means\nto procure many little delicacies and alleviations, such as children or\nprisoners desire.\n\nI am scarcely drawing the portrait of a very melancholy man.  It is not\nindeed my character; and I had, in a comparison with my comrades, many\nreasons for content.  In the first place, I had no family: I was an\norphan and a bachelor; neither wife nor child awaited me in France.  In\nthe second, I had never wholly forgot the emotions with which I first\nfound myself a prisoner; and although a military prison be not altogether\na garden of delights, it is still preferable to a gallows.  In the third,\nI am almost ashamed to say it, but I found a certain pleasure in our\nplace of residence: being an obsolete and really mediaeval fortress, high\nplaced and commanding extraordinary prospects, not only over sea,\nmountain, and champaign but actually over the thoroughfares of a capital\ncity, which we could see blackened by day with the moving crowd of the\ninhabitants, and at night shining with lamps.  And lastly, although I was\nnot insensible to the restraints of prison or the scantiness of our\nrations, I remembered I had sometimes eaten quite as ill in Spain, and\nhad to mount guard and march perhaps a dozen leagues into the bargain.\nThe first of my troubles, indeed, was the costume we were obliged to\nwear.  There is a horrible practice in England to trick out in ridiculous\nuniforms, and as it were to brand in mass, not only convicts but military\nprisoners, and even the children in charity schools.  I think some\nmalignant genius had found his masterpiece of irony in the dress which we\nwere condemned to wear: jacket, waistcoat, and trousers of a sulphur or\nmustard yellow, and a shirt or blue-and-white striped cotton.  It was\nconspicuous, it was cheap, it pointed us out to laughter—we, who were old\nsoldiers, used to arms, and some of us showing noble scars,—like a set of\nlugubrious zanies at a fair.  The old name of that rock on which our\nprison stood was (I have heard since then) the _Painted Hill_.  Well, now\nit was all painted a bright yellow with our costumes; and the dress of\nthe soldiers who guarded us being of course the essential British red\nrag, we made up together the elements of a lively picture of hell.  I\nhave again and again looked round upon my fellow-prisoners, and felt my\nanger rise, and choked upon tears, to behold them thus parodied.  The\nmore part, as I have said, were peasants, somewhat bettered perhaps by\nthe drill-sergeant, but for all that ungainly, loutish fellows, with no\nmore than a mere barrack-room smartness of address: indeed, you could\nhave seen our army nowhere more discreditably represented than in this\nCastle of Edinburgh.  And I used to see myself in fancy, and blush.  It\nseemed that my more elegant carriage would but point the insult of the\ntravesty.  And I remembered the days when I wore the coarse but\nhonourable coat of a soldier; and remembered further back how many of the\nnoble, the fair, and the gracious had taken a delight to tend my\nchildhood. . . .  But I must not recall these tender and sorrowful\nmemories twice; their place is further on, and I am now upon another\nbusiness.  The perfidy of the Britannic Government stood nowhere more\nopenly confessed than in one particular of our discipline: that we were\nshaved twice in the week.  To a man who has loved all his life to be\nfresh shaven, can a more irritating indignity be devised?  Monday and\nThursday were the days.  Take the Thursday, and conceive the picture I\nmust present by Sunday evening!  And Saturday, which was almost as bad,\nwas the great day for visitors.\n\nThose who came to our market were of all qualities, men and women, the\nlean and the stout, the plain and the fairly pretty.  Sure, if people at\nall understood the power of beauty, there would be no prayers addressed\nexcept to Venus; and the mere privilege of beholding a comely woman is\nworth paying for.  Our visitors, upon the whole, were not much to boast\nof; and yet, sitting in a corner and very much ashamed of myself and my\nabsurd appearance, I have again and again tasted the finest, the rarest,\nand the most ethereal pleasures in a glance of an eye that I should never\nsee again—and never wanted to.  The flower of the hedgerow and the star\nin heaven satisfy and delight us: how much more the look of that\nexquisite being who was created to bear and rear, to madden and rejoice,\nmankind!\n\nThere was one young lady in particular, about eighteen or nineteen, tall,\nof a gallant carriage, and with a profusion of hair in which the sun\nfound threads of gold.  As soon as she came in the courtyard (and she was\na rather frequent visitor) it seemed I was aware of it.  She had an air\nof angelic candour, yet of a high spirit; she stepped like a Diana, every\nmovement was noble and free.  One day there was a strong east wind; the\nbanner was straining at the flagstaff; below us the smoke of the city\nchimneys blew hither and thither in a thousand crazy variations; and away\nout on the Forth we could see the ships lying down to it and scudding.  I\nwas thinking what a vile day it was, when she appeared.  Her hair blew in\nthe wind with changes of colour; her garments moulded her with the\naccuracy of sculpture; the ends of her shawl fluttered about her ear and\nwere caught in again with an inimitable deftness.  You have seen a pool\non a gusty day, how it suddenly sparkles and flashes like a thing alive?\nSo this lady’s face had become animated and coloured; and as I saw her\nstanding, somewhat inclined, her lips parted, a divine trouble in her\neyes, I could have clapped my hands in applause, and was ready to acclaim\nher a genuine daughter of the winds.  What put it in my head, I know not:\nperhaps because it was a Thursday and I was new from the razor; but I\ndetermined to engage her attention no later than that day.  She was\napproaching that part of the court in which I sat with my merchandise,\nwhen I observed her handkerchief to escape from her hands and fall to the\nground; the next moment the wind had taken it up and carried it within my\nreach.  I was on foot at once: I had forgot my mustard-coloured clothes,\nI had forgot the private soldier and his salute.  Bowing deeply, I\noffered her the slip of cambric.\n\n‘Madam,’ said I, ‘your handkerchief.  The wind brought it me.’\n\nI met her eyes fully.\n\n‘I thank you, sir,’ said she.\n\n‘The wind brought it me,’ I repeated.  ‘May I not take it for an omen?\nYou have an English proverb, “It’s an ill wind that blows nobody good.”’\n\n‘Well,’ she said, with a smile, ‘“One good turn deserves another.”  I\nwill see what you have.’\n\nShe followed me to where my wares were spread out under lee of a piece of\ncannon.\n\n‘Alas, mademoiselle!’ said I, ‘I am no very perfect craftsman.  This is\nsupposed to be a house, and you see the chimneys are awry.  You may call\nthis a box if you are very indulgent; but see where my tool slipped!\nYes, I am afraid you may go from one to another, and find a flaw in\neverything.  _Failures for Sale_ should be on my signboard.  I do not\nkeep a shop; I keep a Humorous Museum.’  I cast a smiling glance about my\ndisplay, and then at her, and instantly became grave.  ‘Strange, is it\nnot,’ I added, ‘that a grown man and a soldier should be engaged upon\nsuch trash, and a sad heart produce anything so funny to look at?’\n\nAn unpleasant voice summoned her at this moment by the name of Flora, and\nshe made a hasty purchase and rejoined her party.\n\nA few days after she came again.  But I must first tell you how she came\nto be so frequent.  Her aunt was one of those terrible British old maids,\nof which the world has heard much; and having nothing whatever to do, and\na word or two of French, she had taken what she called an _interest in\nthe French prisoners_.  A big, bustling, bold old lady, she flounced\nabout our market-place with insufferable airs of patronage and\ncondescension.  She bought, indeed, with liberality, but her manner of\nstudying us through a quizzing-glass, and playing cicerone to her\nfollowers, acquitted us of any gratitude.  She had a tail behind her of\nheavy, obsequious old gentlemen, or dull, giggling misses, to whom she\nappeared to be an oracle.  ‘This one can really carve prettily: is he not\na quiz with his big whiskers?’ she would say.  ‘And this one,’ indicating\nmyself with her gold eye-glass, ‘is, I assure you, quite an oddity.’  The\noddity, you may be certain, ground his teeth.  She had a way of standing\nin our midst, nodding around, and addressing us in what she imagined to\nbe French: ‘_Bienne_, _hommes_! _ça va bienne_?’  I took the freedom to\nreply in the same lingo: _Bienne_, _femme_! _ça va couci-couci tout\nd’même_, _la bourgeoise_!’  And at that, when we had all laughed with a\nlittle more heartiness than was entirely civil, ‘I told you he was quite\nan oddity!’ says she in triumph.  Needless to say, these passages were\nbefore I had remarked the niece.\n\nThe aunt came on the day in question with a following rather more than\nusually large, which she manoeuvred to and fro about the market and\nlectured to at rather more than usual length, and with rather less than\nher accustomed tact.  I kept my eyes down, but they were ever fixed in\nthe same direction, quite in vain.  The aunt came and went, and pulled us\nout, and showed us off, like caged monkeys; but the niece kept herself on\nthe outskirts of the crowd and on the opposite side of the courtyard, and\ndeparted at last as she had come, without a sign.  Closely as I had\nwatched her, I could not say her eyes had ever rested on me for an\ninstant; and my heart was overwhelmed with bitterness and blackness.  I\ntore out her detested image; I felt I was done with her for ever; I\nlaughed at myself savagely, because I had thought to please; when I lay\ndown at night sleep forsook me, and I lay, and rolled, and gloated on her\ncharms, and cursed her insensibility, for half the night.  How trivial I\nthought her! and how trivial her sex!  A man might be an angel or an\nApollo, and a mustard-coloured coat would wholly blind them to his\nmerits.  I was a prisoner, a slave, a contemned and despicable being, the\nbutt of her sniggering countrymen.  I would take the lesson: no proud\ndaughter of my foes should have the chance to mock at me again; none in\nthe future should have the chance to think I had looked at her with\nadmiration.  You cannot imagine any one of a more resolute and\nindependent spirit, or whose bosom was more wholly mailed with patriotic\narrogance, than I.  Before I dropped asleep, I had remembered all the\ninfamies of Britain, and debited them in an overwhelming column to Flora.\n\nThe next day, as I sat in my place, I became conscious there was some one\nstanding near; and behold, it was herself!  I kept my seat, at first in\nthe confusion of my mind, later on from policy; and she stood, and leaned\na little over me, as in pity.  She was very still and timid; her voice\nwas low.  Did I suffer in my captivity? she asked me.  Had I to complain\nof any hardship?\n\n‘Mademoiselle, I have not learned to complain,’ said I.  ‘I am a soldier\nof Napoleon.’\n\nShe sighed.  ‘At least you must regret _La France_,’ said she, and\ncoloured a little as she pronounced the words, which she did with a\npretty strangeness of accent.\n\n‘What am I to say?’ I replied.  ‘If you were carried from this country,\nfor which you seem so wholly suited, where the very rains and winds seem\nto become you like ornaments, would you regret, do you think?  We must\nsurely all regret! the son to his mother, the man to his country; these\nare native feelings.’\n\n‘You have a mother?’ she asked.\n\n‘In heaven, mademoiselle,’ I answered.  ‘She, and my father also, went by\nthe same road to heaven as so many others of the fair and brave: they\nfollowed their queen upon the scaffold.  So, you see, I am not so much to\nbe pitied in my prison,’ I continued: ‘there are none to wait for me; I\nam alone in the world.  ’Tis a different case, for instance, with yon\npoor fellow in the cloth cap.  His bed is next to mine, and in the night\nI hear him sobbing to himself.  He has a tender character, full of tender\nand pretty sentiments; and in the dark at night, and sometimes by day\nwhen he can get me apart with him, he laments a mother and a sweetheart.\nDo you know what made him take me for a confidant?’\n\nShe parted her lips with a look, but did not speak.  The look burned all\nthrough me with a sudden vital heat.\n\n‘Because I had once seen, in marching by, the belfry of his village!’ I\ncontinued.  ‘The circumstance is quaint enough.  It seems to bind up into\none the whole bundle of those human instincts that make life beautiful,\nand people and places dear—and from which it would seem I am cut off!’\n\nI rested my chin on my knee and looked before me on the ground.  I had\nbeen talking until then to hold her; but I was now not sorry she should\ngo: an impression is a thing so delicate to produce and so easy to\noverthrow!  Presently she seemed to make an effort.\n\n‘I will take this toy,’ she said, laid a five-and-sixpenny piece in my\nhand, and was gone ere I could thank her.\n\nI retired to a place apart near the ramparts and behind a gun.  The\nbeauty, the expression of her eyes, the tear that had trembled there, the\ncompassion in her voice, and a kind of wild elegance that consecrated the\nfreedom of her movements, all combined to enslave my imagination and\ninflame my heart.  What had she said?  Nothing to signify; but her eyes\nhad met mine, and the fire they had kindled burned inextinguishably in my\nveins.  I loved her; and I did not fear to hope.  Twice I had spoken with\nher; and in both interviews I had been well inspired, I had engaged her\nsympathies, I had found words that she must remember, that would ring in\nher ears at night upon her bed.  What mattered if I were half shaved and\nmy clothes a caricature?  I was still a man, and I had drawn my image on\nher memory.  I was still a man, and, as I trembled to realise, she was\nstill a woman.  Many waters cannot quench love; and love, which is the\nlaw of the world, was on my side.  I closed my eyes, and she sprang up on\nthe background of the darkness, more beautiful than in life.  ‘Ah!’\nthought I, ‘and you too, my dear, you too must carry away with you a\npicture, that you are still to behold again and still to embellish.  In\nthe darkness of night, in the streets by day, still you are to have my\nvoice and face, whispering, making love for me, encroaching on your shy\nheart.  Shy as your heart is, _it_ is lodged there—_I_ am lodged there;\nlet the hours do their office—let time continue to draw me ever in more\nlively, ever in more insidious colours.’  And then I had a vision of\nmyself, and burst out laughing.\n\nA likely thing, indeed, that a beggar-man, a private soldier, a prisoner\nin a yellow travesty, was to awake the interest of this fair girl!  I\nwould not despair; but I saw the game must be played fine and close.  It\nmust be my policy to hold myself before her, always in a pathetic or\npleasing attitude; never to alarm or startle her; to keep my own secret\nlocked in my bosom like a story of disgrace, and let hers (if she could\nbe induced to have one) grow at its own rate; to move just so fast, and\nnot by a hair’s-breadth any faster, than the inclination of her heart.  I\nwas the man, and yet I was passive, tied by the foot in prison.  I could\nnot go to her; I must cast a spell upon her at each visit, so that she\nshould return to me; and this was a matter of nice management.  I had\ndone it the last time—it seemed impossible she should not come again\nafter our interview; and for the next I had speedily ripened a fresh\nplan.  A prisoner, if he has one great disability for a lover, has yet\none considerable advantage: there is nothing to distract him, and he can\nspend all his hours ripening his love and preparing its manifestations.\nI had been then some days upon a piece of carving,—no less than the\nemblem of Scotland, the Lion Rampant.  This I proceeded to finish with\nwhat skill I was possessed of; and when at last I could do no more to it\n(and, you may be sure, was already regretting I had done so much), added\non the base the following dedication.—\n\n                               À LA BELLE FLORA\n                         LE PRISONNIER RECONNAISSANT\n                             A. D. ST.  Y. D. K.\n\nI put my heart into the carving of these letters.  What was done with so\nmuch ardour, it seemed scarce possible that any should behold with\nindifference; and the initials would at least suggest to her my noble\nbirth.  I thought it better to suggest: I felt that mystery was my\nstock-in-trade; the contrast between my rank and manners, between my\nspeech and my clothing, and the fact that she could only think of me by a\ncombination of letters, must all tend to increase her interest and engage\nher heart.\n\nThis done, there was nothing left for me but to wait and to hope.  And\nthere is nothing further from my character: in love and in war, I am all\nfor the forward movement; and these days of waiting made my purgatory.\nIt is a fact that I loved her a great deal better at the end of them, for\nlove comes, like bread, from a perpetual rehandling.  And besides, I was\nfallen into a panic of fear.  How, if she came no more, how was I to\ncontinue to endure my empty days? how was I to fall back and find my\ninterest in the major’s lessons, the lieutenant’s chess, in a twopenny\nsale in the market, or a halfpenny addition to the prison fare?\n\nDays went by, and weeks; I had not the courage to calculate, and to-day I\nhave not the courage to remember; but at last she was there.  At last I\nsaw her approach me in the company of a boy about her own age, and whom I\ndivined at once to be her brother.\n\nI rose and bowed in silence.\n\n‘This is my brother, Mr. Ronald Gilchrist,’ said she.  ‘I have told him\nof your sufferings.  He is so sorry for you!’\n\n‘It is more than I have the right to ask,’ I replied; ‘but among\ngentlefolk these generous sentiments are natural.  If your brother and I\nwere to meet in the field, we should meet like tigers; but when he sees\nme here disarmed and helpless, he forgets his animosity.’  (At which, as\nI had ventured to expect, this beardless champion coloured to the ears\nfor pleasure.)  ‘Ah, my dear young lady,’ I continued, ‘there are many of\nyour countrymen languishing in my country, even as I do here.  I can but\nhope there is found some French lady to convey to each of them the\npriceless consolation of her sympathy.  You have given me alms; and more\nthan alms—hope; and while you were absent I was not forgetful.  Suffer me\nto be able to tell myself that I have at least tried to make a return;\nand for the prisoner’s sake deign to accept this trifle.’\n\nSo saying, I offered her my lion, which she took, looked at in some\nembarrassment, and then, catching sight of the dedication, broke out with\na cry.\n\n‘Why, how did you know my name?’ she exclaimed.\n\n‘When names are so appropriate, they should be easily guessed,’ said I,\nbowing.  ‘But indeed, there was no magic in the matter.  A lady called\nyou by name on the day I found your handkerchief, and I was quick to\nremark and cherish it.’\n\n‘It is very, very beautiful,’ said she, ‘and I shall be always proud of\nthe inscription.—Come, Ronald, we must be going.’  She bowed to me as a\nlady bows to her equal, and passed on (I could have sworn) with a\nheightened colour.\n\nI was overjoyed: my innocent ruse had succeeded; she had taken my gift\nwithout a hint of payment, and she would scarce sleep in peace till she\nhad made it up to me.  No greenhorn in matters of the heart, I was\nbesides aware that I had now a resident ambassador at the court of my\nlady.  The lion might be ill chiselled; it was mine.  My hands had made\nand held it; my knife—or, to speak more by the mark, my rusty nail—had\ntraced those letters; and simple as the words were, they would keep\nrepeating to her that I was grateful and that I found her fair.  The boy\nhad looked like a gawky, and blushed at a compliment; I could see besides\nthat he regarded me with considerable suspicion; yet he made so manly a\nfigure of a lad, that I could not withhold from him my sympathy.  And as\nfor the impulse that had made her bring and introduce him, I could not\nsufficiently admire it.  It seemed to me finer than wit, and more tender\nthan a caress.  It said (plain as language), ‘I do not and I cannot know\nyou.  Here is my brother—you can know him; this is the way to me—follow\nit.’\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—A TALE OF A PAIR OF SCISSORS\n\n\nI was still plunged in these thoughts when the bell was rung that\ndischarged our visitors into the street.  Our little market was no sooner\nclosed than we were summoned to the distribution, and received our\nrations, which we were then allowed to eat according to fancy in any part\nof our quarters.\n\nI have said the conduct of some of our visitors was unbearably offensive;\nit was possibly more so than they dreamed—as the sight-seers at a\nmenagerie may offend in a thousand ways, and quite without meaning it,\nthe noble and unfortunate animals behind the bars; and there is no doubt\nbut some of my compatriots were susceptible beyond reason.  Some of these\nold whiskerandos, originally peasants, trained since boyhood in\nvictorious armies, and accustomed to move among subject and trembling\npopulations, could ill brook their change of circumstance.  There was one\nman of the name of Goguelat, a brute of the first water, who had enjoyed\nno touch of civilisation beyond the military discipline, and had risen by\nan extreme heroism of bravery to a grade for which he was otherwise\nunfitted—that of _maréchal des logis_ in the 22nd of the line.  In so far\nas a brute can be a good soldier, he was a good soldier; the Cross was on\nhis breast, and gallantly earned; but in all things outside his line of\nduty the man was no other than a brawling, bruising ignorant pillar of\nlow pothouses.  As a gentleman by birth, and a scholar by taste and\neducation, I was the type of all that he least understood and most\ndetested; and the mere view of our visitors would leave him daily in a\ntransport of annoyance, which he would make haste to wreak on the nearest\nvictim, and too often on myself.\n\nIt was so now.  Our rations were scarce served out, and I had just\nwithdrawn into a corner of the yard, when I perceived him drawing near.\nHe wore an air of hateful mirth; a set of young fools, among whom he\npassed for a wit, followed him with looks of expectation; and I saw I was\nabout to be the object of some of his insufferable pleasantries.  He took\na place beside me, spread out his rations, drank to me derisively from\nhis measure of prison beer, and began.  What he said it would be\nimpossible to print; but his admirers, who believed their wit to have\nsurpassed himself, actually rolled among the gravel.  For my part, I\nthought at first I should have died.  I had not dreamed the wretch was so\nobservant; but hate sharpens the ears, and he had counted our interviews\nand actually knew Flora by her name.  Gradually my coolness returned to\nme, accompanied by a volume of living anger that surprised myself.\n\n‘Are you nearly done?’ I asked.  ‘Because if you are, I am about to say a\nword or two myself.’\n\n‘Oh, fair play!’ said he.  ‘Turn about!  The Marquis of Carabas to the\ntribune.’\n\n‘Very well,’ said I.  ‘I have to inform you that I am a gentleman.  You\ndo not know what that means, hey?  Well, I will tell you.  It is a\ncomical sort of animal; springs from another strange set of creatures\nthey call ancestors; and, in common with toads and other vermin, has a\nthing that he calls feelings.  The lion is a gentleman; he will not touch\ncarrion.  I am a gentleman, and I cannot bear to soil my fingers with\nsuch a lump of dirt.  Sit still, Philippe Goguelat! sit still and do not\nsay a word, or I shall know you are a coward; the eyes of our guards are\nupon us.  Here is your health!’ said I, and pledged him in the prison\nbeer.  ‘You have chosen to speak in a certain way of a young child,’ I\ncontinued, ‘who might be your daughter, and who was giving alms to me and\nsome others of us mendicants.  If the Emperor’—saluting—‘if my Emperor\ncould hear you, he would pluck off the Cross from your gross body.  I\ncannot do that; I cannot take away what His Majesty has given; but one\nthing I promise you—I promise you, Goguelat, you shall be dead to-night.’\n\nI had borne so much from him in the past, I believe he thought there was\nno end to my forbearance, and he was at first amazed.  But I have the\npleasure to think that some of my expressions had pierced through his\nthick hide; and besides, the brute was truly a hero of valour, and loved\nfighting for itself.  Whatever the cause, at least, he had soon pulled\nhimself together, and took the thing (to do him justice) handsomely.\n\n‘And I promise you, by the devil’s horns, that you shall have the\nchance!’ said he, and pledged me again; and again I did him scrupulous\nhonour.\n\nThe news of this defiance spread from prisoner to prisoner with the speed\nof wings; every face was seen to be illuminated like those of the\nspectators at a horse-race; and indeed you must first have tasted the\nactive life of a soldier, and then mouldered for a while in the tedium of\na jail, in order to understand, perhaps even to excuse, the delight of\nour companions.  Goguelat and I slept in the same squad, which greatly\nsimplified the business; and a committee of honour was accordingly formed\nof our shed-mates.  They chose for president a sergeant-major in the 4th\nDragoons, a greybeard of the army, an excellent military subject, and a\ngood man.  He took the most serious view of his functions, visited us\nboth, and reported our replies to the committee.  Mine was of a decent\nfirmness.  I told him the young lady of whom Goguelat had spoken had on\nseveral occasions given me alms.  I reminded him that, if we were now\nreduced to hold out our hands and sell pill-boxes for charity, it was\nsomething very new for soldiers of the Empire.  We had all seen bandits\nstanding at a corner of a wood truckling for copper halfpence, and after\ntheir benefactors were gone spitting out injuries and curses.  ‘But,’\nsaid I, ‘I trust that none of us will fall so low.  As a Frenchman and a\nsoldier, I owe that young child gratitude, and am bound to protect her\ncharacter, and to support that of the army.  You are my elder and my\nsuperior: tell me if I am not right.’\n\nHe was a quiet-mannered old fellow, and patted me with three fingers on\nthe back.  ‘_C’est bien_, _mon enfant_,’ says he, and returned to his\ncommittee.\n\nGoguelat was no more accommodating than myself.  ‘I do not like apologies\nnor those that make them,’ was his only answer.  And there remained\nnothing but to arrange the details of the meeting.  So far as regards\nplace and time we had no choice; we must settle the dispute at night, in\nthe dark, after a round had passed by, and in the open middle of the shed\nunder which we slept.  The question of arms was more obscure.  We had a\ngood many tools, indeed, which we employed in the manufacture of our\ntoys; but they were none of them suited for a single combat between\ncivilised men, and, being nondescript, it was found extremely hard to\nequalise the chances of the combatants.  At length a pair of scissors was\nunscrewed; and a couple of tough wands being found in a corner of the\ncourtyard, one blade of the scissors was lashed solidly to each with\nresined twine—the twine coming I know not whence, but the resin from the\ngreen pillars of the shed, which still sweated from the axe.  It was a\nstrange thing to feel in one’s hand this weapon, which was no heavier\nthan a riding-rod, and which it was difficult to suppose would prove more\ndangerous.  A general oath was administered and taken, that no one should\ninterfere in the duel nor (suppose it to result seriously) betray the\nname of the survivor.  And with that, all being then ready, we composed\nourselves to await the moment.\n\nThe evening fell cloudy; not a star was to be seen when the first round\nof the night passed through our shed and wound off along the ramparts;\nand as we took our places, we could still hear, over the murmurs of the\nsurrounding city, the sentries challenging its further passage.  Leclos,\nthe sergeant-major, set us in our stations, engaged our wands, and left\nus.  To avoid blood-stained clothing, my adversary and I had stripped to\nthe shoes; and the chill of the night enveloped our bodies like a wet\nsheet.  The man was better at fencing than myself; he was vastly taller\nthan I, being of a stature almost gigantic, and proportionately strong.\nIn the inky blackness of the shed, it was impossible to see his eyes; and\nfrom the suppleness of the wands, I did not like to trust to a parade.  I\nmade up my mind accordingly to profit, if I might, by my defect; and as\nsoon as the signal should be given, to throw myself down and lunge at the\nsame moment.  It was to play my life upon one card: should I not mortally\nwound him, no defence would be left me; what was yet more appalling, I\nthus ran the risk of bringing my own face against his scissor with the\ndouble force of our assaults, and my face and eyes are not that part of\nme that I would the most readily expose.\n\n‘_Allez_!’ said the sergeant-major.\n\nBoth lunged in the same moment with an equal fury, and but for my\nmanoeuvre both had certainly been spitted.  As it was, he did no more\nthan strike my shoulder, while my scissor plunged below the girdle into a\nmortal part; and that great bulk of a man, falling from his whole height,\nknocked me immediately senseless.\n\nWhen I came to myself I was laid in my own sleeping-place, and could make\nout in the darkness the outline of perhaps a dozen heads crowded around\nme.  I sat up.  ‘What is it?’ I exclaimed.\n\n‘Hush!’ said the sergeant-major.  ‘Blessed be God, all is well.’  I felt\nhim clasp my hand, and there were tears in his voice.  ‘’Tis but a\nscratch, my child; here is papa, who is taking good care of you.  Your\nshoulder is bound up; we have dressed you in your clothes again, and it\nwill all be well.’\n\nAt this I began to remember.  ‘And Goguelat?’ I gasped.\n\n‘He cannot bear to be moved; he has his bellyful; ’tis a bad business,’\nsaid the sergeant-major.\n\nThe idea of having killed a man with such an instrument as half a pair of\nscissors seemed to turn my stomach.  I am sure I might have killed a\ndozen with a firelock, a sabre, a bayonet, or any accepted weapon, and\nbeen visited by no such sickness of remorse.  And to this feeling every\nunusual circumstance of our rencounter, the darkness in which we had\nfought, our nakedness, even the resin on the twine, appeared to\ncontribute.  I ran to my fallen adversary, kneeled by him, and could only\nsob his name.\n\nHe bade me compose myself.  ‘You have given me the key of the fields,\ncomrade,’ said he.  ‘_Sans rancune_!’\n\nAt this my horror redoubled.  Here had we two expatriated Frenchmen\nengaged in an ill-regulated combat like the battles of beasts.  Here was\nhe, who had been all his life so great a ruffian, dying in a foreign land\nof this ignoble injury, and meeting death with something of the spirit of\na Bayard.  I insisted that the guards should be summoned and a doctor\nbrought.  ‘It may still be possible to save him,’ I cried.\n\nThe sergeant-major reminded me of our engagement.  ‘If you had been\nwounded,’ said he, ‘you must have lain there till the patrol came by and\nfound you.  It happens to be Goguelat—and so must he!  Come, child, time\nto go to by-by.’  And as I still resisted, ‘Champdivers!’ he said, ‘this\nis weakness.  You pain me.’\n\n‘Ay, off to your beds with you!’ said Goguelat, and named us in a company\nwith one of his jovial gross epithets.\n\nAccordingly the squad lay down in the dark and simulated, what they\ncertainly were far from experiencing, sleep.  It was not yet late.  The\ncity, from far below, and all around us, sent up a sound of wheels and\nfeet and lively voices.  Yet awhile, and the curtain of the cloud was\nrent across, and in the space of sky between the eaves of the shed and\nthe irregular outline of the ramparts a multitude of stars appeared.\nMeantime, in the midst of us lay Goguelat, and could not always withhold\nhimself from groaning.\n\nWe heard the round far off; heard it draw slowly nearer.  Last of all, it\nturned the corner and moved into our field of vision: two file of men and\na corporal with a lantern, which he swung to and fro, so as to cast its\nlight in the recesses of the yards and sheds.\n\n‘Hullo!’ cried the corporal, pausing as he came by Goguelat.\n\nHe stooped with his lantern.  All our hearts were flying.\n\n‘What devil’s work is this?’ he cried, and with a startling voice\nsummoned the guard.\n\nWe were all afoot upon the instant; more lanterns and soldiers crowded in\nfront of the shed; an officer elbowed his way in.  In the midst was the\nbig naked body, soiled with blood.  Some one had covered him with his\nblanket; but as he lay there in agony, he had partly thrown it off.\n\n‘This is murder!’ cried the officer.  ‘You wild beasts, you will hear of\nthis to-morrow.’\n\nAs Goguelat was raised and laid upon a stretcher, he cried to us a\ncheerful and blasphemous farewell.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—MAJOR CHEVENIX COMES INTO THE STORY, AND GOGUELAT GOES OUT\n\n\nThere was never any talk of a recovery, and no time was lost in getting\nthe man’s deposition.  He gave but the one account of it: that he had\ncommitted suicide because he was sick of seeing so many Englishmen.  The\ndoctor vowed it was impossible, the nature and direction of the wound\nforbidding it.  Goguelat replied that he was more ingenious than the\nother thought for, and had propped up the weapon in the ground and fallen\non the point—‘just like Nebuchadnezzar,’ he added, winking to the\nassistants.  The doctor, who was a little, spruce, ruddy man of an\nimpatient temper, pished and pshawed and swore over his patient.\n‘Nothing to be made of him!’ he cried.  ‘A perfect heathen.  If we could\nonly find the weapon!’  But the weapon had ceased to exist.  A little\nresined twine was perhaps blowing about in the castle gutters; some bits\nof broken stick may have trailed in corners; and behold, in the pleasant\nair of the morning, a dandy prisoner trimming his nails with a pair of\nscissors!\n\nFinding the wounded man so firm, you may be sure the authorities did not\nleave the rest of us in peace.  No stone was left unturned.  We were had\nin again and again to be examined, now singly, now in twos and threes.\nWe were threatened with all sorts of impossible severities and tempted\nwith all manner of improbable rewards.  I suppose I was five times\ninterrogated, and came off from each with flying colours.  I am like old\nSouvaroff, I cannot understand a soldier being taken aback by any\nquestion; he should answer, as he marches on the fire, with an instant\nbriskness and gaiety.  I may have been short of bread, gold or grace; I\nwas never yet found wanting in an answer.  My comrades, if they were not\nall so ready, were none of them less staunch; and I may say here at once\nthat the inquiry came to nothing at the time, and the death of Goguelat\nremained a mystery of the prison.  Such were the veterans of France!  And\nyet I should be disingenuous if I did not own this was a case apart; in\nordinary circumstances, some one might have stumbled or been intimidated\ninto an admission; and what bound us together with a closeness beyond\nthat of mere comrades was a secret to which we were all committed and a\ndesign in which all were equally engaged.  No need to inquire as to its\nnature: there is only one desire, and only one kind of design, that\nblooms in prisons.  And the fact that our tunnel was near done supported\nand inspired us.\n\nI came off in public, as I have said, with flying colours; the sittings\nof the court of inquiry died away like a tune that no one listens to; and\nyet I was unmasked—I, whom my very adversary defended, as good as\nconfessed, as good as told the nature of the quarrel, and by so doing\nprepared for myself in the future a most anxious, disagreeable adventure.\nIt was the third morning after the duel, and Goguelat was still in life,\nwhen the time came round for me to give Major Chevenix a lesson.  I was\nfond of this occupation; not that he paid me much—no more, indeed, than\neighteenpence a month, the customary figure, being a miser in the grain;\nbut because I liked his breakfasts and (to some extent) himself.  At\nleast, he was a man of education; and of the others with whom I had any\nopportunity of speech, those that would not have held a book upsidedown\nwould have torn the pages out for pipe-lights.  For I must repeat again\nthat our body of prisoners was exceptional: there was in Edinburgh Castle\nnone of that educational busyness that distinguished some of the other\nprisons, so that men entered them unable to read, and left them fit for\nhigh employments.  Chevenix was handsome, and surprisingly young to be a\nmajor: six feet in his stockings, well set up, with regular features and\nvery clear grey eyes.  It was impossible to pick a fault in him, and yet\nthe sum-total was displeasing.  Perhaps he was too clean; he seemed to\nbear about with him the smell of soap.  Cleanliness is good, but I cannot\nbear a man’s nails to seem japanned.  And certainly he was too\nself-possessed and cold.  There was none of the fire of youth, none of\nthe swiftness of the soldier, in this young officer.  His kindness was\ncold, and cruel cold; his deliberation exasperating.  And perhaps it was\nfrom this character, which is very much the opposite of my own, that even\nin these days, when he was of service to me, I approached him with\nsuspicion and reserve.\n\nI looked over his exercise in the usual form, and marked six faults.\n\n‘H’m.  Six,’ says he, looking at the paper.  ‘Very annoying!  I can never\nget it right.’\n\n‘Oh, but you make excellent progress!’ I said.  I would not discourage\nhim, you understand, but he was congenitally unable to learn French.\nSome fire, I think, is needful, and he had quenched his fire in soapsuds.\n\nHe put the exercise down, leaned his chin upon his hand, and looked at me\nwith clear, severe eyes.\n\n‘I think we must have a little talk,’ said he.\n\n‘I am entirely at your disposition,’ I replied; but I quaked, for I knew\nwhat subject to expect.\n\n‘You have been some time giving me these lessons,’ he went on, ‘and I am\ntempted to think rather well of you.  I believe you are a gentleman.’\n\n‘I have that honour, sir,’ said I.\n\n‘You have seen me for the same period.  I do not know how I strike you;\nbut perhaps you will be prepared to believe that I also am a man of\nhonour,’ said he.\n\n‘I require no assurances; the thing is manifest,’ and I bowed.\n\n‘Very well, then,’ said he.  ‘What about this Goguelat?’\n\n‘You heard me yesterday before the court,’ I began.  ‘I was awakened\nonly—’\n\n‘Oh yes; I “heard you yesterday before the court,” no doubt,’ he\ninterrupted, ‘and I remember perfectly that you were “awakened only.”  I\ncould repeat the most of it by rote, indeed.  But do you suppose that I\nbelieved you for a moment?’\n\n‘Neither would you believe me if I were to repeat it here,’ said I.\n\n‘I may be wrong—we shall soon see,’ says he; ‘but my impression is that\nyou will not “repeat it here.”  My impression is that you have come into\nthis room, and that you will tell me something before you go out.’\n\nI shrugged my shoulders.\n\n‘Let me explain,’ he continued.  ‘Your evidence, of course, is nonsense.\nI put it by, and the court put it by.’\n\n‘My compliments and thanks!’ said I.\n\n‘You _must_ know—that’s the short and the long,’ he proceeded.  ‘All of\nyou in shed B are bound to know.  And I want to ask you where is the\ncommon-sense of keeping up this farce, and maintaining this cock-and-bull\nstory between friends.  Come, come, my good fellow, own yourself beaten,\nand laugh at it yourself.’\n\n‘Well, I hear you, go ahead,’ said I.  ‘You put your heart in it.’\n\nHe crossed his legs slowly.  ‘I can very well understand,’ he began,\n‘that precautions have had to be taken.  I dare say an oath was\nadministered.  I can comprehend that perfectly.’  (He was watching me all\nthe time with his cold, bright eyes.)  ‘And I can comprehend that, about\nan affair of honour, you would be very particular to keep it.’\n\n‘About an affair of honour?’ I repeated, like a man quite puzzled.\n\n‘It was not an affair of honour, then?’ he asked.\n\n‘What was not?  I do not follow,’ said I.\n\nHe gave no sign of impatience; simply sat awhile silent, and began again\nin the same placid and good-natured voice: ‘The court and I were at one\nin setting aside your evidence.  It could not deceive a child.  But there\nwas a difference between myself and the other officers, because _I knew\nmy man_ and they did not.  They saw in you a common soldier, and I knew\nyou for a gentleman.  To them your evidence was a leash of lies, which\nthey yawned to hear you telling.  Now, I was asking myself, how far will\na gentleman go?  Not surely so far as to help hush a murder up?  So\nthat—when I heard you tell how you knew nothing of the matter, and were\nonly awakened by the corporal, and all the rest of it—I translated your\nstatements into something else.  Now, Champdivers,’ he cried, springing\nup lively and coming towards me with animation, ‘I am going to tell you\nwhat that was, and you are going to help me to see justice done: how, I\ndon’t know, for of course you are under oath—but somehow.  Mark what I’m\ngoing to say.’\n\nAt that moment he laid a heavy, hard grip upon my shoulder; and whether\nhe said anything more or came to a full stop at once, I am sure I could\nnot tell you to this day.  For, as the devil would have it, the shoulder\nhe laid hold of was the one Goguelat had pinked.  The wound was but a\nscratch; it was healing with the first intention; but in the clutch of\nMajor Chevenix it gave me agony.  My head swam; the sweat poured off my\nface; I must have grown deadly pale.\n\nHe removed his hand as suddenly as he had laid it there.  ‘What is wrong\nwith you?’ said he.\n\n‘It is nothing,’ said I.  ‘A qualm.  It has gone by.’\n\n‘Are you sure?’ said he.  ‘You are as white as a sheet.’\n\n‘Oh no, I assure you!  Nothing whatever.  I am my own man again,’ I said,\nthough I could scarce command my tongue.\n\n‘Well, shall I go on again?’ says he.  ‘Can you follow me?’\n\n‘Oh, by all means!’ said I, and mopped my streaming face upon my sleeve,\nfor you may be sure in those days I had no handkerchief.\n\n‘If you are sure you can follow me.  That was a very sudden and sharp\nseizure,’ he said doubtfully.  ‘But if you are sure, all right, and here\ngoes.  An affair of honour among you fellows would, naturally, be a\nlittle difficult to carry out, perhaps it would be impossible to have it\nwholly regular.  And yet a duel might be very irregular in form, and,\nunder the peculiar circumstances of the case, loyal enough in effect.  Do\nyou take me?  Now, as a gentleman and a soldier.’\n\nHis hand rose again at the words and hovered over me.  I could bear no\nmore, and winced away from him.  ‘No,’ I cried,  ‘not that.  Do not put\nyour hand upon my shoulder.  I cannot bear it.  It is rheumatism,’ I made\nhaste to add.  ‘My shoulder is inflamed and very painful.’\n\nHe returned to his chair and deliberately lighted a cigar.\n\n‘I am sorry about your shoulder,’ he said at last.  ‘Let me send for the\ndoctor.’\n\n‘Not in the least,’ said I.  ‘It is a trifle.  I am quite used to it.  It\ndoes not trouble me in the smallest.  At any rate, I don’t believe in\ndoctors.’\n\n‘All right,’ said he, and sat and smoked a good while in a silence which\nI would have given anything to break.  ‘Well,’ he began presently, ‘I\nbelieve there is nothing left for me to learn.  I presume I may say that\nI know all.’\n\n‘About what?’ said I boldly.\n\n‘About Goguelat,’ said he.\n\n‘I beg your pardon.  I cannot conceive,’ said I.\n\n‘Oh,’ says the major, ‘the man fell in a duel, and by your hand!  I am\nnot an infant.’\n\n‘By no means,’ said I.  ‘But you seem to me to be a good deal of a\ntheorist.’\n\n‘Shall we test it?’ he asked.  ‘The doctor is close by.  If there is not\nan open wound on your shoulder, I am wrong.  If there is—’  He waved his\nhand.  ‘But I advise you to think twice.  There is a deuce of a nasty\ndrawback to the experiment—that what might have remained private between\nus two becomes public property.’\n\n‘Oh, well!’ said I, with a laugh, ‘anything rather than a doctor!  I\ncannot bear the breed.’\n\nHis last words had a good deal relieved me, but I was still far from\ncomfortable.\n\nMajor Chevenix smoked awhile, looking now at his cigar ash, now at me.\n‘I’m a soldier myself,’ he says presently, ‘and I’ve been out in my time\nand hit my man.  I don’t want to run any one into a corner for an affair\nthat was at all necessary or correct.  At the same time, I want to know\nthat much, and I’ll take your word of honour for it.  Otherwise, I shall\nbe very sorry, but the doctor must be called in.’\n\n‘I neither admit anything nor deny anything,’ I returned.  ‘But if this\nform of words will suffice you, here is what I say: I give you my parole,\nas a gentleman and a soldier, there has nothing taken place amongst us\nprisoners that was not honourable as the day.’\n\n‘All right,’ says he.  ‘That was all I wanted.  You can go now,\nChampdivers.’\n\nAnd as I was going out he added, with a laugh: ‘By the bye, I ought to\napologise: I had no idea I was applying the torture!’\n\nThe same afternoon the doctor came into the courtyard with a piece of\npaper in his hand.  He seemed hot and angry, and had certainly no mind to\nbe polite.\n\n‘Here!’ he cried.  ‘Which of you fellows knows any English?  Oh!’—spying\nme—‘there you are, what’s your name!  _You’ll_ do.  Tell these fellows\nthat the other fellow’s dying.  He’s booked; no use talking; I expect\nhe’ll go by evening.  And tell them I don’t envy the feelings of the\nfellow who spiked him.  Tell them that first.’\n\nI did so.\n\n‘Then you can tell ’em,’ he resumed, ‘that the fellow, Goggle—what’s his\nname?—wants to see some of them before he gets his marching orders.  If I\ngot it right, he wants to kiss or embrace you, or some sickening stuff.\nGot that?  Then here’s a list he’s had written, and you’d better read it\nout to them—I can’t make head or tail of your beastly names—and they can\nanswer _present_, and fall in against that wall.’\n\nIt was with a singular movement of incongruous feelings that I read the\nfirst name on the list.  I had no wish to look again on my own handiwork;\nmy flesh recoiled from the idea; and how could I be sure what reception\nhe designed to give me?  The cure was in my own hand; I could pass that\nfirst name over—the doctor would not know—and I might stay away.  But to\nthe subsequent great gladness of my heart, I did not dwell for an instant\non the thought, walked over to the designated wall, faced about, read out\nthe name ‘Champdivers,’ and answered myself with the word ‘Present.’\n\nThere were some half dozen on the list, all told; and as soon as we were\nmustered, the doctor led the way to the hospital, and we followed after,\nlike a fatigue party, in single file.  At the door he paused, told us\n‘the fellow’ would see each of us alone, and, as soon as I had explained\nthat, sent me by myself into the ward.  It was a small room, whitewashed;\na south window stood open on a vast depth of air and a spacious and\ndistant prospect; and from deep below, in the Grassmarket the voices of\nhawkers came up clear and far away.  Hard by, on a little bed, lay\nGoguelat.  The sunburn had not yet faded from his face, and the stamp of\ndeath was already there.  There was something wild and unmannish in his\nsmile, that took me by the throat; only death and love know or have ever\nseen it.  And when he spoke, it seemed to shame his coarse talk.\n\nHe held out his arms as if to embrace me.  I drew near with incredible\nshrinkings, and surrendered myself to his arms with overwhelming disgust.\nBut he only drew my ear down to his lips.\n\n‘Trust me,’ he whispered.  ‘_Je suis bon bougre_, _moi_.  I’ll take it to\nhell with me, and tell the devil.’\n\nWhy should I go on to reproduce his grossness and trivialities?  All that\nhe thought, at that hour, was even noble, though he could not clothe it\notherwise than in the language of a brutal farce.  Presently he bade me\ncall the doctor; and when that officer had come in, raised a little up in\nhis bed, pointed first to himself and then to me, who stood weeping by\nhis side, and several times repeated the expression, ‘Frinds—frinds—dam\nfrinds.’\n\nTo my great surprise, the doctor appeared very much affected.  He nodded\nhis little bob-wigged head at us, and said repeatedly, ‘All right,\nJohnny—me comprong.’\n\nThen Goguelat shook hands with me, embraced me again, and I went out of\nthe room sobbing like an infant.\n\nHow often have I not seen it, that the most unpardonable fellows make the\nhappiest exits!  It is a fate we may well envy them.  Goguelat was\ndetested in life; in the last three days, by his admirable staunchness\nand consideration, he won every heart; and when word went about the\nprison the same evening that he was no more, the voice of conversation\nbecame hushed as in a house of mourning.\n\nFor myself I was like a man distracted; I cannot think what ailed me:\nwhen I awoke the following day, nothing remained of it; but that night I\nwas filled with a gloomy fury of the nerves.  I had killed him; he had\ndone his utmost to protect me; I had seen him with that awful smile.  And\nso illogical and useless is this sentiment of remorse, that I was ready,\nat a word or a look, to quarrel with somebody else.  I presume the\ndisposition of my mind was imprinted on my face; and when, a little\nafter, I overtook, saluted and addressed the doctor, he looked on me with\ncommiseration and surprise.\n\nI had asked him if it was true.\n\n‘Yes,’ he said, ‘the fellow’s gone.’\n\n‘Did he suffer much?’ I asked.\n\n‘Devil a bit; passed away like a lamb,’ said he.  He looked on me a\nlittle, and I saw his hand go to his fob.  ‘Here, take that! no sense in\nfretting,’ he said, and, putting a silver two-penny-bit in my hand, he\nleft me.\n\nI should have had that twopenny framed to hang upon the wall, for it was\nthe man’s one act of charity in all my knowledge of him.  Instead of\nthat, I stood looking at it in my hand and laughed out bitterly, as I\nrealised his mistake; then went to the ramparts, and flung it far into\nthe air like blood money.  The night was falling; through an embrasure\nand across the gardened valley I saw the lamplighters hasting along\nPrinces Street with ladder and lamp, and looked on moodily.  As I was so\nstanding a hand was laid upon my shoulder, and I turned about.  It was\nMajor Chevenix, dressed for the evening, and his neckcloth really\nadmirably folded.  I never denied the man could dress.\n\n‘Ah!’ said he, ‘I thought it was you, Champdivers.  So he’s gone?’\n\nI nodded.\n\n‘Come, come,’ said he, ‘you must cheer up.  Of course it’s very\ndistressing, very painful and all that.  But do you know, it ain’t such a\nbad thing either for you or me?  What with his death and your visit to\nhim I am entirely reassured.’\n\nSo I was to owe my life to Goguelat at every point.\n\n‘I had rather not discuss it,’ said I.\n\n‘Well,’ said he, ‘one word more, and I’ll agree to bury the subject.\nWhat did you fight about?’\n\n‘Oh, what do men ever fight about?’ I cried.\n\n‘A lady?’ said he.\n\nI shrugged my shoulders.\n\n‘Deuce you did!’ said he.  ‘I should scarce have thought it of him.’\n\nAnd at this my ill-humour broke fairly out in words.  ‘He!’ I cried.  ‘He\nnever dared to address her—only to look at her and vomit his vile\ninsults!  She may have given him sixpence: if she did, it may take him to\nheaven yet!’\n\nAt this I became aware of his eyes set upon me with a considering look,\nand brought up sharply.\n\n‘Well, well,’ said he.  ‘Good night to you, Champdivers.  Come to me at\nbreakfast-time to-morrow, and we’ll talk of other subjects.’\n\nI fully admit the man’s conduct was not bad: in writing it down so long\nafter the events I can even see that it was good.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—ST. IVES GETS A BUNDLE OF BANK NOTES\n\n\nI was surprised one morning, shortly after, to find myself the object of\nmarked consideration by a civilian and a stranger.  This was a man of the\nmiddle age; he had a face of a mulberry colour, round black eyes, comical\ntufted eyebrows, and a protuberant forehead; and was dressed in clothes\nof a Quakerish cut.  In spite of his plainness, he had that inscrutable\nair of a man well-to-do in his affairs.  I conceived he had been some\nwhile observing me from a distance, for a sparrow sat betwixt us quite\nunalarmed on the breech of a piece of cannon.  So soon as our eyes met,\nhe drew near and addressed me in the French language, which he spoke with\na good fluency but an abominable accent.\n\n‘I have the pleasure of addressing Monsieur le Vicomte Anne de Kéroual de\nSaint-Yves?’ said he.\n\n‘Well,’ said I, ‘I do not call myself all that; but I have a right to, if\nI chose.  In the meanwhile I call myself plain Champdivers, at your\ndisposal.  It was my mother’s name, and good to go soldiering with.’\n\n‘I think not quite,’ said he; ‘for if I remember rightly, your mother\nalso had the particle.  Her name was Florimonde de Champdivers.’\n\n‘Right again!’ said I, ‘and I am extremely pleased to meet a gentleman so\nwell informed in my quarterings.  Is monsieur Born himself?’  This I said\nwith a great air of assumption, partly to conceal the degree of curiosity\nwith which my visitor had inspired me, and in part because it struck me\nas highly incongruous and comical in my prison garb and on the lips of a\nprivate soldier.\n\nHe seemed to think so too, for he laughed.\n\n‘No, sir,’ he returned, speaking this time in English; ‘I am not\n“_born_,” as you call it, and must content myself with _dying_, of which\nI am equally susceptible with the best of you.  My name is Mr.\nRomaine—Daniel Romaine—a solicitor of London City, at your service; and,\nwhat will perhaps interest you more, I am here at the request of your\ngreat-uncle, the Count.’\n\n‘What!’ I cried, ‘does M. de Kéroual de St.-Yves remember the existence\nof such a person as myself, and will he deign to count kinship with a\nsoldier of Napoleon?’\n\n‘You speak English well,’ observed my visitor.\n\n‘It has been a second language to me from a child,’ said I.  ‘I had an\nEnglish nurse; my father spoke English with me; and I was finished by a\ncountryman of yours and a dear friend of mine, a Mr. Vicary.’\n\nA strong expression of interest came into the lawyer’s face.\n\n‘What!’ he cried, ‘you knew poor Vicary?’\n\n‘For more than a year,’ said I; ‘and shared his hiding-place for many\nmonths.’\n\n‘And I was his clerk, and have succeeded him in business,’ said he.\n‘Excellent man!  It was on the affairs of M. de Kéroual that he went to\nthat accursed country, from which he was never destined to return.  Do\nyou chance to know his end, sir?’\n\n‘I am sorry,’ said I, ‘I do.  He perished miserably at the hands of a\ngang of banditti, such as we call _chauffeurs_.  In a word, he was\ntortured, and died of it.  See,’ I added, kicking off one shoe, for I had\nno stockings; ‘I was no more than a child, and see how they had begun to\ntreat myself.’\n\nHe looked at the mark of my old burn with a certain shrinking.  ‘Beastly\npeople!’ I heard him mutter to himself.\n\n‘The English may say so with a good grace,’ I observed politely.\n\nSuch speeches were the coin in which I paid my way among this credulous\nrace.  Ninety per cent. of our visitors would have accepted the remark as\nnatural in itself and creditable to my powers of judgment, but it\nappeared my lawyer was more acute.\n\n‘You are not entirely a fool, I perceive,’ said he.\n\n‘No,’ said I; ‘not wholly.’\n\n‘And yet it is well to beware of the ironical mood,’ he continued.  ‘It\nis a dangerous instrument.  Your great-uncle has, I believe, practised it\nvery much, until it is now become a problem what he means.’\n\n‘And that brings me back to what you will admit is a most natural\ninquiry,’ said I.  ‘To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit? how did\nyou recognise me? and how did you know I was here?’\n\nCarefull separating his coat skirts, the lawyer took a seat beside me on\nthe edge of the flags.\n\n‘It is rather an odd story,’ says he, ‘and, with your leave, I’ll answer\nthe second question first.  It was from a certain resemblance you bear to\nyour cousin, M. le Vicomte.’\n\n‘I trust, sir, that I resemble him advantageously?’ said I.\n\n‘I hasten to reassure you,’ was the reply: ‘you do.  To my eyes, M. Alain\nde St.-Yves has scarce a pleasing exterior.  And yet, when I knew you\nwere here, and was actually looking for you—why, the likeness helped.  As\nfor how I came to know your whereabouts, by an odd enough chance, it is\nagain M. Alain we have to thank.  I should tell you, he has for some time\nmade it his business to keep M. de Kéroual informed of your career; with\nwhat purpose I leave you to judge.  When he first brought the news of\nyour—that you were serving Buonaparte, it seemed it might be the death of\nthe old gentleman, so hot was his resentment.  But from one thing to\nanother, matters have a little changed.  Or I should rather say, not a\nlittle.  We learned you were under orders for the Peninsula, to fight the\nEnglish; then that you had been commissioned for a piece of bravery, and\nwere again reduced to the ranks.  And from one thing to another (as I\nsay), M. de Kéroual became used to the idea that you were his kinsman and\nyet served with Buonaparte, and filled instead with wonder that he should\nhave another kinsman who was so remarkably well informed of events in\nFrance.  And it now became a very disagreeable question, whether the\nyoung gentleman was not a spy?  In short, sir, in seeking to disserve\nyou, he had accumulated against himself a load of suspicions.’\n\nMy visitor now paused, took snuff, and looked at me with an air of\nbenevolence.\n\n‘Good God, sir!’ says I, ‘this is a curious story.’\n\n‘You will say so before I have done,’ said he.  ‘For there have two\nevents followed.  The first of these was an encounter of M. de Kéroual\nand M. de Mauseant.’\n\n‘I know the man to my cost,’ said I: ‘it was through him I lost my\ncommission.’\n\n‘Do you tell me so?’ he cried.  ‘Why, here is news!’\n\n‘Oh, I cannot complain!’ said I.  ‘I was in the wrong.  I did it with my\neyes open.  If a man gets a prisoner to guard and lets him go, the least\nhe can expect is to be degraded.’\n\n‘You will be paid for it,’ said he.  ‘You did well for yourself and\nbetter for your king.’\n\n‘If I had thought I was injuring my emperor,’ said I, ‘I would have let\nM. de Mauseant burn in hell ere I had helped him, and be sure of that!  I\nsaw in him only a private person in a difficulty: I let him go in private\ncharity; not even to profit myself will I suffer it to be misunderstood.’\n\n‘Well, well,’ said the lawyer, ‘no matter now.  This is a foolish\nwarmth—a very misplaced enthusiasm, believe me!  The point of the story\nis that M. de Mauseant spoke of you with gratitude, and drew your\ncharacter in such a manner as greatly to affect your uncle’s views.  Hard\nupon the back of which, in came your humble servant, and laid before him\nthe direct proof of what we had been so long suspecting.  There was no\ndubiety permitted.  M. Alain’s expensive way of life, his clothes and\nmistresses, his dicing and racehorses, were all explained: he was in the\npay of Buonaparte, a hired spy, and a man that held the strings of what I\ncan only call a convolution of extremely fishy enterprises.  To do M. de\nKéroual justice, he took it in the best way imaginable, destroyed the\nevidences of the one great-nephew’s disgrace—and transferred his interest\nwholly to the other.’\n\n‘What am I to understand by that?’ said I.\n\n‘I will tell you,’ says he.  ‘There is a remarkable inconsistency in\nhuman nature which gentlemen of my cloth have a great deal of occasion to\nobserve.  Selfish persons can live without chick or child, they can live\nwithout all mankind except perhaps the barber and the apothecary; but\nwhen it comes to dying, they seem physically unable to die without an\nheir.  You can apply this principle for yourself.  Viscount Alain, though\nhe scarce guesses it, is no longer in the field.  Remains, Viscount\nAnne.’\n\n‘I see,’ said I, ‘you give a very unfavourable impression of my uncle,\nthe Count.’\n\n‘I had not meant it,’ said he.  ‘He has led a loose life—sadly loose—but\nhe is a man it is impossible to know and not to admire; his courtesy is\nexquisite.’\n\n‘And so you think there is actually a chance for me?’ I asked.\n\n‘Understand,’ said he: ‘in saying as much as I have done, I travel quite\nbeyond my brief.  I have been clothed with no capacity to talk of wills,\nor heritages, or your cousin.  I was sent here to make but the one\ncommunication: that M. de Kéroual desires to meet his great-nephew.’\n\n‘Well,’ said I, looking about me on the battlements by which we sat\nsurrounded, ‘this is a case in which Mahomet must certainly come to the\nmountain.’\n\n‘Pardon me,’ said Mr. Romaine; ‘you know already your uncle is an aged\nman; but I have not yet told you that he is quite broken up, and his\ndeath shortly looked for.  No, no, there is no doubt about it—it is the\nmountain that must come to Mahomet.’\n\n‘From an Englishman, the remark is certainly significant,’ said I; ‘but\nyou are of course, and by trade, a keeper of men’s secrets, and I see you\nkeep that of Cousin Alain, which is not the mark of a truculent\npatriotism, to say the least.’\n\n‘I am first of all the lawyer of your family!’ says he.\n\n‘That being so,’ said I, ‘I can perhaps stretch a point myself.  This\nrock is very high, and it is very steep; a man might come by a devil of a\nfall from almost any part of it, and yet I believe I have a pair of wings\nthat might carry me just so far as to the bottom.  Once at the bottom I\nam helpless.’\n\n‘And perhaps it is just then that I could step in,’ returned the lawyer.\n‘Suppose by some contingency, at which I make no guess, and on which I\noffer no opinion—’\n\nBut here I interrupted him.  ‘One word ere you go further.  I am under no\nparole,’ said I.\n\n‘I understood so much,’ he replied, ‘although some of you French gentry\nfind their word sit lightly on them.’\n\n‘Sir, I am not one of those,’ said I.\n\n‘To do you plain justice, I do not think you one,’ said he.  ‘Suppose\nyourself, then, set free and at the bottom of the rock,’ he continued,\n‘although I may not be able to do much, I believe I can do something to\nhelp you on your road.  In the first place I would carry this, whether in\nan inside pocket or my shoe.’  And he passed me a bundle of bank notes.\n\n‘No harm in that,’ said I, at once concealing them.\n\n‘In the second place,’ he resumed, ‘it is a great way from here to where\nyour uncle lives—Amersham Place, not far from Dunstable; you have a great\npart of Britain to get through; and for the first stages, I must leave\nyou to your own luck and ingenuity.  I have no acquaintance here in\nScotland, or at least’ (with a grimace) ‘no dishonest ones.  But further\nto the south, about Wakefield, I am told there is a gentleman called\nBurchell Fenn, who is not so particular as some others, and might be\nwilling to give you a cast forward.  In fact, sir, I believe it’s the\nman’s trade: a piece of knowledge that burns my mouth.  But that is what\nyou get by meddling with rogues; and perhaps the biggest rogue now\nextant, M. de Saint-Yves, is your cousin, M. Alain.’\n\n‘If this be a man of my cousin’s,’ I observed, ‘I am perhaps better to\nkeep clear of him?’\n\n‘It was through some paper of your cousin’s that we came across his\ntrail,’ replied the lawyer.  ‘But I am inclined to think, so far as\nanything is safe in such a nasty business, you might apply to the man\nFenn.  You might even, I think, use the Viscount’s name; and the little\ntrick of family resemblance might come in.  How, for instance, if you\nwere to call yourself his brother?’\n\n‘It might be done,’ said I.  ‘But look here a moment?  You propose to me\na very difficult game: I have apparently a devil of an opponent in my\ncousin; and, being a prisoner of war, I can scarcely be said to hold good\ncards.  For what stakes, then, am I playing?’\n\n‘They are very large,’ said he.  ‘Your great-uncle is immensely\nrich—immensely rich.  He was wise in time; he smelt the revolution long\nbefore; sold all that he could, and had all that was movable transported\nto England through my firm.  There are considerable estates in England;\nAmersham Place itself is very fine; and he has much money, wisely\ninvested.  He lives, indeed, like a prince.  And of what use is it to\nhim?  He has lost all that was worth living for—his family, his country;\nhe has seen his king and queen murdered; he has seen all these miseries\nand infamies,’ pursued the lawyer, with a rising inflection and a\nheightening colour; and then broke suddenly off,—‘In short, sir, he has\nseen all the advantages of that government for which his nephew carries\narms, and he has the misfortune not to like them.’\n\n‘You speak with a bitterness that I suppose I must excuse,’ said I; ‘yet\nwhich of us has the more reason to be bitter?  This man, my uncle, M. de\nKéroual, fled.  My parents, who were less wise perhaps, remained.  In the\nbeginning, they were even republicans; to the end they could not be\npersuaded to despair of the people.  It was a glorious folly, for which,\nas a son, I reverence them.  First one and then the other perished.  If I\nhave any mark of a gentleman, all who taught me died upon the scaffold,\nand my last school of manners was the prison of the Abbaye.  Do you think\nyou can teach bitterness to a man with a history like mine?’\n\n‘I have no wish to try,’ said he.  ‘And yet there is one point I cannot\nunderstand: I cannot understand that one of your blood and experience\nshould serve the Corsican.  I cannot understand it: it seems as though\neverything generous in you must rise against that—domination.’\n\n‘And perhaps,’ I retorted, ‘had your childhood passed among wolves, you\nwould have been overjoyed yourself to see the Corsican Shepherd.’\n\n‘Well, well,’ replied Mr. Romaine, ‘it may be.  There are things that do\nnot bear discussion.’\n\nAnd with a wave of his hand he disappeared abruptly down a flight of\nsteps and under the shadow of a ponderous arch.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—ST. IVES IS SHOWN A HOUSE\n\n\nThe lawyer was scarce gone before I remembered many omissions; and chief\namong these, that I had neglected to get Mr. Burchell Fenn’s address.\nHere was an essential point neglected; and I ran to the head of the\nstairs to find myself already too late.  The lawyer was beyond my view;\nin the archway that led downward to the castle gate, only the red coat\nand the bright arms of a sentry glittered in the shadow; and I could but\nreturn to my place upon the ramparts.\n\nI am not very sure that I was properly entitled to this corner.  But I\nwas a high favourite; not an officer, and scarce a private, in the castle\nwould have turned me back, except upon a thing of moment; and whenever I\ndesired to be solitary, I was suffered to sit here behind my piece of\ncannon unmolested.  The cliff went down before me almost sheer, but\nmantled with a thicket of climbing trees; from farther down, an outwork\nraised its turret; and across the valley I had a view of that long\nterrace of Princes Street which serves as a promenade to the fashionable\ninhabitants of Edinburgh.  A singularity in a military prison, that it\nshould command a view on the chief thoroughfare!\n\nIt is not necessary that I should trouble you with the train of my\nreflections, which turned upon the interview I had just concluded and the\nhopes that were now opening before me.  What is more essential, my eye\n(even while I thought) kept following the movement of the passengers on\nPrinces Street, as they passed briskly to and fro—met, greeted, and bowed\nto each other—or entered and left the shops, which are in that quarter,\nand, for a town of the Britannic provinces, particularly fine.  My mind\nbeing busy upon other things, the course of my eye was the more random;\nand it chanced that I followed, for some time, the advance of a young\ngentleman with a red head and a white great-coat, for whom I cared\nnothing at the moment, and of whom it is probable I shall be gathered to\nmy fathers without learning more.  He seemed to have a large\nacquaintance: his hat was for ever in his hand; and I daresay I had\nalready observed him exchanging compliments with half a dozen, when he\ndrew up at last before a young man and a young lady whose tall persons\nand gallant carriage I thought I recognised.\n\nIt was impossible at such a distance that I could be sure, but the\nthought was sufficient, and I craned out of the embrasure to follow them\nas long as possible.  To think that such emotions, that such a concussion\nof the blood, may have been inspired by a chance resemblance, and that I\nmay have stood and thrilled there for a total stranger!  This distant\nview, at least, whether of Flora or of some one else, changed in a moment\nthe course of my reflections.  It was all very well, and it was highly\nneedful, I should see my uncle; but an uncle, a great-uncle at that, and\none whom I had never seen, leaves the imagination cold; and if I were to\nleave the castle, I might never again have the opportunity of finding\nFlora.  The little impression I had made, even supposing I had made any,\nhow soon it would die out! how soon I should sink to be a phantom memory,\nwith which (in after days) she might amuse a husband and children!  No,\nthe impression must be clenched, the wax impressed with the seal, ere I\nleft Edinburgh.  And at this the two interests that were now contending\nin my bosom came together and became one.  I wished to see Flora again;\nand I wanted some one to further me in my flight and to get me new\nclothes.  The conclusion was apparent.  Except for persons in the\ngarrison itself, with whom it was a point of honour and military duty to\nretain me captive, I knew, in the whole country of Scotland, these two\nalone.  If it were to be done at all, they must be my helpers.  To tell\nthem of my designed escape while I was still in bonds, would be to lay\nbefore them a most difficult choice.  What they might do in such a case,\nI could not in the least be sure of, for (the same case arising) I was\nfar from sure what I should do myself.  It was plain I must escape first.\nWhen the harm was done, when I was no more than a poor wayside fugitive,\nI might apply to them with less offence and more security.  To this end\nit became necessary that I should find out where they lived and how to\nreach it; and feeling a strong confidence that they would soon return to\nvisit me, I prepared a series of baits with which to angle for my\ninformation.  It will be seen the first was good enough.\n\nPerhaps two days after, Master Ronald put in an appearance by himself.  I\nhad no hold upon the boy, and pretermitted my design till I should have\nlaid court to him and engaged his interest.  He was prodigiously\nembarrassed, not having previously addressed me otherwise than by a bow\nand blushes; and he advanced to me with an air of one stubbornly\nperforming a duty, like a raw soldier under fire.  I laid down my\ncarving; greeted him with a good deal of formality, such as I thought he\nwould enjoy; and finding him to remain silent, branched off into\nnarratives of my campaigns such as Goguelat himself might have scrupled\nto endorse.  He visibly thawed and brightened; drew more near to where I\nsat; forgot his timidity so far as to put many questions; and at last,\nwith another blush, informed me he was himself expecting a commission.\n\n‘Well,’ said I, ‘they are fine troops, your British troops in the\nPeninsula.  A young gentleman of spirit may well be proud to be engaged\nat the head of such soldiers.’\n\n‘I know that,’ he said; ‘I think of nothing else.  I think shame to be\ndangling here at home and going through with this foolery of education,\nwhile others, no older than myself, are in the field.’\n\n‘I cannot blame you,’ said I.  ‘I have felt the same myself.’\n\n‘There are—there are no troops, are there, quite so good as ours?’ he\nasked.\n\n‘Well,’ said I, ‘there is a point about them: they have a defect,—they\nare not to be trusted in a retreat.  I have seen them behave very ill in\na retreat.’\n\n‘I believe that is our national character,’ he said—God forgive him!—with\nan air of pride.\n\n‘I have seen your national character running away at least, and had the\nhonour to run after it!’ rose to my lips, but I was not so ill advised as\nto give it utterance.  Every one should be flattered, but boys and women\nwithout stint; and I put in the rest of the afternoon narrating to him\ntales of British heroism, for which I should not like to engage that they\nwere all true.\n\n‘I am quite surprised,’ he said at last.  ‘People tell you the French are\ninsincere.  Now, I think your sincerity is beautiful.  I think you have a\nnoble character.  I admire you very much.  I am very grateful for your\nkindness to—to one so young,’ and he offered me his hand.\n\n‘I shall see you again soon?’ said I.\n\n‘Oh, now!  Yes, very soon,’ said he.  ‘I—I wish to tell you.  I would not\nlet Flora—Miss Gilchrist, I mean—come to-day.  I wished to see more of\nyou myself.  I trust you are not offended: you know, one should be\ncareful about strangers.’\n\nI approved his caution, and he took himself away: leaving me in a mixture\nof contrarious feelings, part ashamed to have played on one so gullible,\npart raging that I should have burned so much incense before the vanity\nof England; yet, in the bottom of my soul, delighted to think I had made\na friend—or, at least, begun to make a friend—of Flora’s brother.\n\nAs I had half expected, both made their appearance the next day.  I\nstruck so fine a shade betwixt the pride that is allowed to soldiers and\nthe sorrowful humility that befits a captive, that I declare, as I went\nto meet them, I might have afforded a subject for a painter.  So much was\nhigh comedy, I must confess; but so soon as my eyes lighted full on her\ndark face and eloquent eyes, the blood leaped into my cheeks—and that was\nnature!  I thanked them, but not the least with exultation; it was my cue\nto be mournful, and to take the pair of them as one.\n\n‘I have been thinking,’ I said, ‘you have been so good to me, both of\nyou, stranger and prisoner as I am, that I have been thinking how I could\ntestify to my gratitude.  It may seem a strange subject for a confidence,\nbut there is actually no one here, even of my comrades, that knows me by\nmy name and title.  By these I am called plain Champdivers, a name to\nwhich I have a right, but not the name which I should bear, and which\n(but a little while ago) I must hide like a crime.  Miss Flora, suffer me\nto present to you the Vicomte Anne de Kéroual de Saint-Yves, a private\nsoldier.’\n\n‘I knew it!’ cried the boy; ‘I knew he was a noble!’\n\nAnd I thought the eyes of Miss Flora said the same, but more\npersuasively.  All through this interview she kept them on the ground, or\nonly gave them to me for a moment at a time, and with a serious\nsweetness.\n\n‘You may conceive, my friends, that this is rather a painful confession,’\nI continued.  ‘To stand here before you, vanquished, a prisoner in a\nfortress, and take my own name upon my lips, is painful to the proud.\nAnd yet I wished that you should know me.  Long after this, we may yet\nhear of one another—perhaps Mr. Gilchrist and myself in the field and\nfrom opposing camps—and it would be a pity if we heard and did not\nrecognise.’\n\nThey were both moved; and began at once to press upon me offers of\nservice, such as to lend me books, get me tobacco if I used it, and the\nlike.  This would have been all mighty welcome, before the tunnel was\nready.  Now it signified no more to me than to offer the transition I\nrequired.\n\n‘My dear friends,’ I said—‘for you must allow me to call you that, who\nhave no others within so many hundred leagues—perhaps you will think me\nfanciful and sentimental; and perhaps indeed I am; but there is one\nservice that I would beg of you before all others.  You see me set here\non the top of this rock in the midst of your city.  Even with what\nliberty I have, I have the opportunity to see a myriad roofs, and I dare\nto say, thirty leagues of sea and land.  All this hostile!  Under all\nthese roofs my enemies dwell; wherever I see the smoke of a house rising,\nI must tell myself that some one sits before the chimney and reads with\njoy of our reverses.  Pardon me, dear friends, I know that you must do\nthe same, and I do not grudge at it!  With you, it is all different.\nShow me your house then, were it only the chimney, or, if that be not\nvisible, the quarter of the town in which it lies!  So, when I look all\nabout me, I shall be able to say: “_There is one house in which I am not\nquite unkindly thought of_.”’\n\nFlora stood a moment.\n\n‘It is a pretty thought,’ said she, ‘and, as far as regards Ronald and\nmyself, a true one.  Come, I believe I can show you the very smoke out of\nour chimney.’\n\nSo saying, she carried me round the battlements towards the opposite or\nsouthern side of the fortress, and indeed to a bastion almost immediately\noverlooking the place of our projected flight.  Thence we had a view of\nsome foreshortened suburbs at our feet, and beyond of a green, open, and\nirregular country rising towards the Pentland Hills.  The face of one of\nthese summits (say two leagues from where we stood) is marked with a\nprocession of white scars.  And to this she directed my attention.\n\n‘You see these marks?’ she said.  ‘We call them the Seven Sisters.\nFollow a little lower with your eye, and you will see a fold of the hill,\nthe tops of some trees, and a tail of smoke out of the midst of them.\nThat is Swanston Cottage, where my brother and I are living with my aunt.\nIf it gives you pleasure to see it, I am glad.  We, too, can see the\ncastle from a corner in the garden, and we go there in the morning\noften—do we not, Ronald?—and we think of you, M. de Saint-Yves; but I am\nafraid it does not altogether make us glad.’\n\n‘Mademoiselle!’ said I, and indeed my voice was scarce under command, ‘if\nyou knew how your generous words—how even the sight of you—relieved the\nhorrors of this place, I believe, I hope, I know, you would be glad.  I\nwill come here daily and look at that dear chimney and these green hills,\nand bless you from the heart, and dedicate to you the prayers of this\npoor sinner.  Ah!  I do not say they can avail!’\n\n‘Who can say that, M. de Saint-Yves?’ she said softly.  ‘But I think it\nis time we should be going.’\n\n‘High time,’ said Ronald, whom (to say the truth) I had a little\nforgotten.\n\nOn the way back, as I was laying myself out to recover lost ground with\nthe youth, and to obliterate, if possible, the memory of my last and\nsomewhat too fervent speech, who should come past us but the major?  I\nhad to stand aside and salute as he went by, but his eyes appeared\nentirely occupied with Flora.\n\n‘Who is that man?’ she asked.\n\n‘He is a friend of mine,’ said I.  ‘I give him lessons in French, and he\nhas been very kind to me.’\n\n‘He stared,’ she said,—‘I do not say, rudely; but why should he stare?’\n\n‘If you do not wish to be stared at, mademoiselle, suffer me to recommend\na veil,’ said I.\n\nShe looked at me with what seemed anger.  ‘I tell you the man stared,’\nshe said.\n\nAnd Ronald added.  ‘Oh, I don’t think he meant any harm.  I suppose he\nwas just surprised to see us walking about with a pr--- with M.\nSaint-Yves.’\n\nBut the next morning, when I went to Chevenix’s rooms, and after I had\ndutifully corrected his exercise—‘I compliment you on your taste,’ said\nhe to me.\n\n‘I beg your pardon?’ said I.\n\n‘Oh no, I beg yours,’ said he.  ‘You understand me perfectly, just as I\ndo you.’\n\nI murmured something about enigmas.\n\n‘Well, shall I give you the key to the enigma?’ said he, leaning back.\n‘That was the young lady whom Goguelat insulted and whom you avenged.  I\ndo not blame you.  She is a heavenly creature.’\n\n‘With all my heart, to the last of it!’ said I.  ‘And to the first also,\nif it amuses you!  You are become so very acute of late that I suppose\nyou must have your own way.’\n\n‘What is her name?’ he asked.\n\n‘Now, really!’ said I.  ‘Do you think it likely she has told me?’\n\n‘I think it certain,’ said he.\n\nI could not restrain my laughter.  ‘Well, then, do you think it likely I\nwould tell you?’ I cried.\n\n‘Not a bit.’ said he.  ‘But come, to our lesson!’\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—THE ESCAPE\n\n\nThe time for our escape drew near, and the nearer it came the less we\nseemed to enjoy the prospect.  There is but one side on which this castle\ncan be left either with dignity or safety; but as there is the main gate\nand guard, and the chief street of the upper city, it is not to be\nthought of by escaping prisoners.  In all other directions an abominable\nprecipice surrounds it, down the face of which (if anywhere at all) we\nmust regain our liberty.  By our concurrent labours in many a dark night,\nworking with the most anxious precautions against noise, we had made out\nto pierce below the curtain about the south-west corner, in a place they\ncall the _Devil’s Elbow_.  I have never met that celebrity; nor (if the\nrest of him at all comes up to what they called his elbow) have I the\nleast desire of his acquaintance.  From the heel of the masonry, the\nrascally, breakneck precipice descended sheer among waste lands,\nscattered suburbs of the city, and houses in the building.  I had never\nthe heart to look for any length of time—the thought that I must make the\ndescent in person some dark night robbing me of breath; and, indeed, on\nanybody not a seaman or a steeple-jack, the mere sight of the _Devil’s\nElbow_ wrought like an emetic.\n\nI don’t know where the rope was got, and doubt if I much cared.  It was\nnot that which gravelled me, but whether, now that we had it, it would\nserve our turn.  Its length, indeed, we made a shift to fathom out; but\nwho was to tell us how that length compared with the way we had to go?\nDay after day, there would be always some of us stolen out to the\n_Devil’s Elbow_ and making estimates of the descent, whether by a bare\nguess or the dropping of stones.  A private of pioneers remembered the\nformula for that—or else remembered part of it and obligingly invented\nthe remainder.  I had never any real confidence in that formula; and even\nhad we got it from a book, there were difficulties in the way of the\napplication that might have daunted Archimedes.  We durst not drop any\nconsiderable pebble lest the sentinels should hear, and those that we\ndropped we could not hear ourselves.  We had never a watch—or none that\nhad a second-hand; and though every one of us could guess a second to a\nnicety, all somehow guessed it differently.  In short, if any two set\nforth upon this enterprise, they invariably returned with two opinions,\nand often with a black eye in the bargain.  I looked on upon these\nproceedings, although not without laughter, yet with impatience and\ndisgust.  I am one that cannot bear to see things botched or gone upon\nwith ignorance; and the thought that some poor devil was to hazard his\nbones upon such premises, revolted me.  Had I guessed the name of that\nunhappy first adventurer, my sentiments might have been livelier still.\n\nThe designation of this personage was indeed all that remained for us to\ndo; and even in that we had advanced so far that the lot had fallen on\nShed B.  It had been determined to mingle the bitter and the sweet; and\nwhoever went down first, the whole of his shed-mates were to follow next\nin order.  This caused a good deal of joy in Shed B, and would have\ncaused more if it had not still remained to choose our pioneer.  In view\nof the ambiguity in which we lay as to the length of the rope and the\nheight of the precipice—and that this gentleman was to climb down from\nfifty to seventy fathoms on a pitchy night, on a rope entirely free, and\nwith not so much as an infant child to steady it at the bottom, a little\nbackwardness was perhaps excusable.  But it was, in our case, more than a\nlittle.  The truth is, we were all womanish fellows about a height; and I\nhave myself been put, more than once, _hors de combat_ by a less affair\nthan the rock of Edinburgh Castle.\n\nWe discussed it in the dark and between the passage of the rounds; and it\nwas impossible for any body of men to show a less adventurous spirit.  I\nam sure some of us, and myself first among the number, regretted\nGoguelat.  Some were persuaded it was safe, and could prove the same by\nargument; but if they had good reasons why some one else should make the\ntrial, they had better still why it should not be themselves.  Others,\nagain, condemned the whole idea as insane; among these, as ill-luck would\nhave it, a seaman of the fleet; who was the most dispiriting of all.  The\nheight, he reminded us, was greater than the tallest ship’s mast, the\nrope entirely free; and he as good as defied the boldest and strongest to\nsucceed.  We were relieved from this dead-lock by our sergeant-major of\ndragoons.\n\n‘Comrades,’ said he, ‘I believe I rank you all; and for that reason, if\nyou really wish it, I will be the first myself.  At the same time, you\nare to consider what the chances are that I may prove to be the last, as\nwell.  I am no longer young—I was sixty near a month ago.  Since I have\nbeen a prisoner, I have made for myself a little _bedaine_.  My arms are\nall gone to fat.  And you must promise not to blame me, if I fall and\nplay the devil with the whole thing.’\n\n‘We cannot hear of such a thing!’ said I.  ‘M. Laclas is the oldest man\nhere; and, as such, he should be the very last to offer.  It is plain, we\nmust draw lots.’\n\n‘No,’ said M. Laclas; ‘you put something else in my head!  There is one\nhere who owes a pretty candle to the others, for they have kept his\nsecret.  Besides, the rest of us are only rabble; and he is another\naffair altogether.  Let Champdivers—let the noble go the first.’\n\nI confess there was a notable pause before the noble in question got his\nvoice.  But there was no room for choice.  I had been so ill-advised,\nwhen I first joined the regiment, as to take ground on my nobility.  I\nhad been often rallied on the matter in the ranks, and had passed under\nthe by-names of _Monseigneur_ and _the Marquis_.  It was now needful I\nshould justify myself and take a fair revenge.\n\nAny little hesitation I may have felt passed entirely unnoticed, from the\nlucky incident of a round happening at that moment to go by.  And during\nthe interval of silence there occurred something that sent my blood to\nthe boil.  There was a private in our shed called Clausel, a man of a\nvery ugly disposition.  He had made one of the followers of Goguelat;\nbut, whereas Goguelat had always a kind of monstrous gaiety about him,\nClausel was no less morose than he was evil-minded.  He was sometimes\ncalled _the General_, and sometimes by a name too ill-mannered for\nrepetition.  As we all sat listening, this man’s hand was laid on my\nshoulder, and his voice whispered in my ear: ‘If you don’t go, I’ll have\nyou hanged, Marquis!’\n\nAs soon as the round was past—‘Certainly, gentlemen!’ said I.  ‘I will\ngive you a lead, with all the pleasure in the world.  But, first of all,\nthere is a hound here to be punished.  M. Clausel has just insulted me,\nand dishonoured the French army; and I demand that he run the gauntlet of\nthis shed.’\n\nThere was but one voice asking what he had done, and, as soon as I had\ntold them, but one voice agreeing to the punishment.  The General was, in\nconsequence, extremely roughly handled, and the next day was\ncongratulated by all who saw him on his _new decorations_.  It was lucky\nfor us that he was one of the prime movers and believers in our project\nof escape, or he had certainly revenged himself by a denunciation.  As\nfor his feelings towards myself, they appeared, by his looks, to surpass\nhumanity; and I made up my mind to give him a wide berth in the future.\n\nHad I been to go down that instant, I believe I could have carried it\nwell.  But it was already too late—the day was at hand.  The rest had\nstill to be summoned.  Nor was this the extent of my misfortune; for the\nnext night, and the night after, were adorned with a perfect galaxy of\nstars, and showed every cat that stirred in a quarter of a mile.  During\nthis interval, I have to direct your sympathies on the Vicomte de\nSaint-Yves!  All addressed me softly, like folk round a sickbed.  Our\nItalian corporal, who had got a dozen of oysters from a fishwife, laid\nthem at my feet, as though I were a Pagan idol; and I have never since\nbeen wholly at my ease in the society of shellfish.  He who was the best\nof our carvers brought me a snuff-box, which he had just completed, and\nwhich, while it was yet in hand, he had often declared he would not part\nwith under fifteen dollars.  I believe the piece was worth the money too!\nAnd yet the voice stuck in my throat with which I must thank him.  I\nfound myself, in a word, to be fed up like a prisoner in a camp of\nanthropophagi, and honoured like the sacrificial bull.  And what with\nthese annoyances, and the risky venture immediately ahead, I found my\npart a trying one to play.\n\nIt was a good deal of a relief when the third evening closed about the\ncastle with volumes of sea-fog.  The lights of Princes Street sometimes\ndisappeared, sometimes blinked across at us no brighter than the eyes of\ncats; and five steps from one of the lanterns on the ramparts it was\nalready groping dark.  We made haste to lie down.  Had our jailers been\nupon the watch, they must have observed our conversation to die out\nunusually soon.  Yet I doubt if any of us slept.  Each lay in his place,\ntortured at once with the hope of liberty and the fear of a hateful\ndeath.  The guard call sounded; the hum of the town declined by little\nand little.  On all sides of us, in their different quarters, we could\nhear the watchman cry the hours along the street.  Often enough, during\nmy stay in England, have I listened to these gruff or broken voices; or\nperhaps gone to my window when I lay sleepless, and watched the old\ngentleman hobble by upon the causeway with his cape and his cap, his\nhanger and his rattle.  It was ever a thought with me how differently\nthat cry would re-echo in the chamber of lovers, beside the bed of death,\nor in the condemned cell.  I might be said to hear it that night myself\nin the condemned cell!  At length a fellow with a voice like a bull’s\nbegan to roar out in the opposite thoroughfare:\n\n‘Past yin o’cloak, and a dark, haary moarnin’.’\n\nAt which we were all silently afoot.\n\nAs I stole about the battlements towards the—gallows, I was about to\nwrite—the sergeant-major, perhaps doubtful of my resolution, kept close\nby me, and occasionally proffered the most indigestible reassurances in\nmy ear.  At last I could bear them no longer.\n\n‘Be so obliging as to let me be!’ said I.  ‘I am neither a coward nor a\nfool.  What do _you_ know of whether the rope be long enough?  But I\nshall know it in ten minutes!’\n\nThe good old fellow laughed in his moustache, and patted me.\n\nIt was all very well to show the disposition of my temper before a friend\nalone; before my assembled comrades the thing had to go handsomely.  It\nwas then my time to come on the stage; and I hope I took it handsomely.\n\n‘Now, gentlemen,’ said I, ‘if the rope is ready, here is the criminal!’\n\nThe tunnel was cleared, the stake driven, the rope extended.  As I moved\nforward to the place, many of my comrades caught me by the hand and wrung\nit, an attention I could well have done without.\n\n‘Keep an eye on Clausel!’ I whispered to Laclas; and with that, got down\non my elbows and knees took the rope in both hands, and worked myself,\nfeet foremost, through the tunnel.  When the earth failed under my feet,\nI thought my heart would have stopped; and a moment after I was demeaning\nmyself in mid-air like a drunken jumping-jack.  I have never been a model\nof piety, but at this juncture prayers and a cold sweat burst from me\nsimultaneously.\n\nThe line was knotted at intervals of eighteen inches; and to the inexpert\nit may seem as if it should have been even easy to descend.  The trouble\nwas, this devil of a piece of rope appeared to be inspired, not with life\nalone, but with a personal malignity against myself.  It turned to the\none side, paused for a moment, and then spun me like a toasting-jack to\nthe other; slipped like an eel from the clasp of my feet; kept me all the\ntime in the most outrageous fury of exertion; and dashed me at intervals\nagainst the face of the rock.  I had no eyes to see with; and I doubt if\nthere was anything to see but darkness.  I must occasionally have caught\na gasp of breath, but it was quite unconscious.  And the whole forces of\nmy mind were so consumed with losing hold and getting it again, that I\ncould scarce have told whether I was going up or coming down.\n\nOf a sudden I knocked against the cliff with such a thump as almost\nbereft me of my sense; and, as reason twinkled back, I was amazed to find\nthat I was in a state of rest, that the face of the precipice here\ninclined outwards at an angle which relieved me almost wholly of the\nburthen of my own weight, and that one of my feet was safely planted on a\nledge.  I drew one of the sweetest breaths in my experience, hugged\nmyself against the rope, and closed my eyes in a kind of ecstasy of\nrelief.  It occurred to me next to see how far I was advanced on my\nunlucky journey, a point on which I had not a shadow of a guess.  I\nlooked up: there was nothing above me but the blackness of the night and\nthe fog.  I craned timidly forward and looked down.  There, upon a floor\nof darkness, I beheld a certain pattern of hazy lights, some of them\naligned as in thoroughfares, others standing apart as in solitary houses;\nand before I could well realise it, or had in the least estimated my\ndistance, a wave of nausea and vertigo warned me to lie back and close my\neyes.  In this situation I had really but the one wish, and that was:\nsomething else to think of!  Strange to say, I got it: a veil was torn\nfrom my mind, and I saw what a fool I was—what fools we had all been—and\nthat I had no business to be thus dangling between earth and heaven by my\narms.  The only thing to have done was to have attached me to a rope and\nlowered me, and I had never the wit to see it till that moment!\n\nI filled my lungs, got a good hold on my rope, and once more launched\nmyself on the descent.  As it chanced, the worst of the danger was at an\nend, and I was so fortunate as to be never again exposed to any violent\nconcussion.  Soon after I must have passed within a little distance of a\nbush of wallflower, for the scent of it came over me with that impression\nof reality which characterises scents in darkness.  This made me a second\nlandmark, the ledge being my first.  I began accordingly to compute\nintervals of time: so much to the ledge, so much again to the wallflower,\nso much more below.  If I were not at the bottom of the rock, I\ncalculated I must be near indeed to the end of the rope, and there was no\ndoubt that I was not far from the end of my own resources.  I began to be\nlight-headed and to be tempted to let go,—now arguing that I was\ncertainly arrived within a few feet of the level and could safely risk a\nfall, anon persuaded I was still close at the top and it was idle to\ncontinue longer on the rock.  In the midst of which I came to a bearing\non plain ground, and had nearly wept aloud.  My hands were as good as\nflayed, my courage entirely exhausted, and, what with the long strain and\nthe sudden relief, my limbs shook under me with more than the violence of\nague, and I was glad to cling to the rope.\n\nBut this was no time to give way.  I had (by God’s single mercy) got\nmyself alive out of that fortress; and now I had to try to get the\nothers, my comrades.  There was about a fathom of rope to spare; I got it\nby the end, and searched the whole ground thoroughly for anything to make\nit fast to.  In vain: the ground was broken and stony, but there grew not\nthere so much as a bush of furze.\n\n‘Now then,’ thought I to myself, ‘here begins a new lesson, and I believe\nit will prove richer than the first.  I am not strong enough to keep this\nrope extended.  If I do not keep it extended the next man will be dashed\nagainst the precipice.  There is no reason why he should have my\nextravagant good luck.  I see no reason why he should not fall—nor any\nplace for him to fall on but my head.’\n\nFrom where I was now standing there was occasionally visible, as the fog\nlightened, a lamp in one of the barrack windows, which gave me a measure\nof the height he had to fall and the horrid force that he must strike me\nwith.  What was yet worse, we had agreed to do without signals: every so\nmany minutes by Laclas’ watch another man was to be started from the\nbattlements.  Now, I had seemed to myself to be about half an hour in my\ndescent, and it seemed near as long again that I waited, straining on the\nrope for my next comrade to begin.  I began to be afraid that our\nconspiracy was out, that my friends were all secured, and that I should\npass the remainder of the night, and be discovered in the morning, vainly\nclinging to the rope’s end like a hooked fish upon an angle.  I could not\nrefrain, at this ridiculous image, from a chuckle of laughter.  And the\nnext moment I knew, by the jerking of the rope, that my friend had\ncrawled out of the tunnel and was fairly launched on his descent.  It\nappears it was the sailor who had insisted on succeeding me: as soon as\nmy continued silence had assured him the rope was long enough, Gautier,\nfor that was his name, had forgot his former arguments, and shown himself\nso extremely forward, that Laclas had given way.  It was like the fellow,\nwho had no harm in him beyond an instinctive selfishness.  But he was\nlike to have paid pretty dearly for the privilege.  Do as I would, I\ncould not keep the rope as I could have wished it; and he ended at last\nby falling on me from a height of several yards, so that we both rolled\ntogether on the ground.  As soon as he could breathe he cursed me beyond\nbelief, wept over his finger, which he had broken, and cursed me again.\nI bade him be still and think shame of himself to be so great a cry-baby.\nDid he not hear the round going by above? I asked; and who could tell but\nwhat the noise of his fall was already remarked, and the sentinels at the\nvery moment leaning upon the battlements to listen?\n\nThe round, however, went by, and nothing was discovered; the third man\ncame to the ground quite easily; the fourth was, of course, child’s play;\nand before there were ten of us collected, it seemed to me that, without\nthe least injustice to my comrades, I might proceed to take care of\nmyself.\n\nI knew their plan: they had a map and an almanack, and designed for\nGrangemouth, where they were to steal a ship.  Suppose them to do so, I\nhad no idea they were qualified to manage it after it was stolen.  Their\nwhole escape, indeed, was the most haphazard thing imaginable; only the\nimpatience of captives and the ignorance of private soldiers would have\nentertained so misbegotten a device; and though I played the good comrade\nand worked with them upon the tunnel, but for the lawyer’s message I\nshould have let them go without me.  Well, now they were beyond my help,\nas they had always been beyond my counselling; and, without word said or\nleave taken, I stole out of the little crowd.  It is true I would rather\nhave waited to shake hands with Laclas, but in the last man who had\ndescended I thought I recognised Clausel, and since the scene in the shed\nmy distrust of Clausel was perfect.  I believed the man to be capable of\nany infamy, and events have since shown that I was right.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—SWANSTON COTTAGE\n\n\nI had two views.  The first was, naturally, to get clear of Edinburgh\nCastle and the town, to say nothing of my fellow-prisoners; the second to\nwork to the southward so long as it was night, and be near Swanston\nCottage by morning.  What I should do there and then, I had no guess, and\ndid not greatly care, being a devotee of a couple of divinities called\nChance and Circumstance.  Prepare, if possible; where it is impossible,\nwork straight forward, and keep your eyes open and your tongue oiled.\nWit and a good exterior—there is all life in a nutshell.\n\nI had at first a rather chequered journey: got involved in gardens,\nbutted into houses, and had even once the misfortune to awake a sleeping\nfamily, the father of which, as I suppose, menaced me from the window\nwith a blunderbuss.  Altogether, though I had been some time gone from my\ncompanions, I was still at no great distance, when a miserable accident\nput a period to the escape.  Of a sudden the night was divided by a\nscream.  This was followed by the sound of something falling, and that\nagain by the report of a musket from the Castle battlements.  It was\nstrange to hear the alarm spread through the city.  In the fortress drums\nwere beat and a bell rung backward.  On all hands the watchmen sprang\ntheir rattles.  Even in that limbo or no-man’s-land where I was\nwandering, lights were made in the houses; sashes were flung up; I could\nhear neighbouring families converse from window to window, and at length\nI was challenged myself.\n\n‘Wha’s that?’ cried a big voice.\n\nI could see it proceeded from a big man in a big nightcap, leaning from a\none-pair window; and as I was not yet abreast of his house, I judged it\nwas more wise to answer.  This was not the first time I had had to stake\nmy fortunes on the goodness of my accent in a foreign tongue; and I have\nalways found the moment inspiriting, as a gambler should.  Pulling around\nme a sort of great-coat I had made of my blanket, to cover my\nsulphur-coloured livery,—‘A friend!’ said I.\n\n‘What like’s all this collieshangie?’ said he.\n\nI had never heard of a collieshangie in my days, but with the racket all\nabout us in the city, I could have no doubt as to the man’s meaning.\n\n‘I do not know, sir, really,’ said I; ‘but I suppose some of the\nprisoners will have escaped.’\n\n‘Bedamned!’ says he.\n\n‘Oh, sir, they will be soon taken,’ I replied: ‘it has been found in\ntime.  Good morning, sir!’\n\n‘Ye walk late, sir?’ he added.\n\n‘Oh, surely not,’ said I, with a laugh.  ‘Earlyish, if you like!’ which\nbrought me finally beyond him, highly pleased with my success.\n\nI was now come forth on a good thoroughfare, which led (as well as I\ncould judge) in my direction.  It brought me almost immediately through a\npiece of street, whence I could hear close by the springing of a\nwatchman’s rattle, and where I suppose a sixth part of the windows would\nbe open, and the people, in all sorts of night gear, talking with a kind\nof tragic gusto from one to another.  Here, again, I must run the\ngauntlet of a half-dozen questions, the rattle all the while sounding\nnearer; but as I was not walking inordinately quick, as I spoke like a\ngentleman, and the lamps were too dim to show my dress, I carried it off\nonce more.  One person, indeed, inquired where I was off to at that hour.\n\nI replied vaguely and cheerfully, and as I escaped at one end of this\ndangerous pass I could see the watchman’s lantern entering by the other.\nI was now safe on a dark country highway, out of sight of lights and out\nof the fear of watchmen.  And yet I had not gone above a hundred yards\nbefore a fellow made an ugly rush at me from the roadside.  I avoided him\nwith a leap, and stood on guard, cursing my empty hands, wondering\nwhether I had to do with an officer or a mere footpad, and scarce knowing\nwhich to wish.  My assailant stood a little; in the thick darkness I\ncould see him bob and sidle as though he were feinting at me for an\nadvantageous onfall.  Then he spoke.\n\n‘My goo’ frien’,’ says he, and at the first word I pricked my ears, ‘my\ngoo’ frien’, will you oblishe me with lil neshary infamation?  Whish roa’\nt’ Cramond?’\n\nI laughed out clear and loud, stepped up to the convivialist, took him by\nthe shoulders and faced him about.  ‘My good friend,’ said I, ‘I believe\nI know what is best for you much better than yourself, and may God\nforgive you the fright you have given me!  There, get you gone to\nEdinburgh!’  And I gave a shove, which he obeyed with the passive agility\nof a ball, and disappeared incontinently in the darkness down the road by\nwhich I had myself come.\n\nOnce clear of this foolish fellow, I went on again up a gradual hill,\ndescended on the other side through the houses of a country village, and\ncame at last to the bottom of the main ascent leading to the Pentlands\nand my destination.  I was some way up when the fog began to lighten; a\nlittle farther, and I stepped by degrees into a clear starry night, and\nsaw in front of me, and quite distinct, the summits of the Pentlands, and\nbehind, the valley of the Forth and the city of my late captivity buried\nunder a lake of vapour.  I had but one encounter—that of a farm-cart,\nwhich I heard, from a great way ahead of me, creaking nearer in the\nnight, and which passed me about the point of dawn like a thing seen in a\ndream, with two silent figures in the inside nodding to the horse’s\nsteps.  I presume they were asleep; by the shawl about her head and\nshoulders, one of them should be a woman.  Soon, by concurrent steps, the\nday began to break and the fog to subside and roll away.  The east grew\nluminous and was barred with chilly colours, and the Castle on its rock,\nand the spires and chimneys of the upper town, took gradual shape, and\narose, like islands, out of the receding cloud.  All about me was still\nand sylvan; the road mounting and winding, with nowhere a sign of any\npassenger, the birds chirping, I suppose for warmth, the boughs of the\ntrees knocking together, and the red leaves falling in the wind.\n\nIt was broad day, but still bitter cold and the sun not up, when I came\nin view of my destination.  A single gable and chimney of the cottage\npeeped over the shoulder of the hill; not far off, and a trifle higher on\nthe mountain, a tall old white-washed farmhouse stood among the trees,\nbeside a falling brook; beyond were rough hills of pasture.  I bethought\nme that shepherd folk were early risers, and if I were once seen skulking\nin that neighbourhood it might prove the ruin of my prospects; took\nadvantage of a line of hedge, and worked myself up in its shadow till I\nwas come under the garden wall of my friends’ house.  The cottage was a\nlittle quaint place of many rough-cast gables and grey roofs.  It had\nsomething the air of a rambling infinitesimal cathedral, the body of it\nrising in the midst two storeys high, with a steep-pitched roof, and\nsending out upon all hands (as it were chapter-houses, chapels, and\ntransepts) one-storeyed and dwarfish projections.  To add to this\nappearance, it was grotesquely decorated with crockets and gargoyles,\nravished from some medieval church.  The place seemed hidden away, being\nnot only concealed in the trees of the garden, but, on the side on which\nI approached it, buried as high as the eaves by the rising of the ground.\nAbout the walls of the garden there went a line of well-grown elms and\nbeeches, the first entirely bare, the last still pretty well covered with\nred leaves, and the centre was occupied with a thicket of laurel and\nholly, in which I could see arches cut and paths winding.\n\nI was now within hail of my friends, and not much the better.  The house\nappeared asleep; yet if I attempted to wake any one, I had no guarantee\nit might not prove either the aunt with the gold eyeglasses (whom I could\nonly remember with trembling), or some ass of a servant-maid who should\nburst out screaming at sight of me.  Higher up I could hear and see a\nshepherd shouting to his dogs and striding on the rough sides of the\nmountain, and it was clear I must get to cover without loss of time.  No\ndoubt the holly thickets would have proved a very suitable retreat, but\nthere was mounted on the wall a sort of signboard not uncommon in the\ncountry of Great Britain, and very damping to the adventurous: SPRING\nGUNS AND MAN-TRAPS was the legend that it bore.  I have learned since\nthat these advertisements, three times out of four, were in the nature of\nQuaker guns on a disarmed battery, but I had not learned it then, and\neven so, the odds would not have been good enough.  For a choice, I would\na hundred times sooner be returned to Edinburgh Castle and my corner in\nthe bastion, than to leave my foot in a steel trap or have to digest the\ncontents of an automatic blunderbuss.  There was but one chance left—that\nRonald or Flora might be the first to come abroad; and in order to profit\nby this chance if it occurred, I got me on the cope of the wall in a\nplace where it was screened by the thick branches of a beech, and sat\nthere waiting.\n\nAs the day wore on, the sun came very pleasantly out.  I had been awake\nall night, I had undergone the most violent agitations of mind and body,\nand it is not so much to be wondered at, as it was exceedingly unwise and\nfoolhardy, that I should have dropped into a doze.  From this I awakened\nto the characteristic sound of digging, looked down, and saw immediately\nbelow me the back view of a gardener in a stable waistcoat.  Now he would\nappear steadily immersed in his business; anon, to my more immediate\nterror, he would straighten his back, stretch his arms, gaze about the\notherwise deserted garden, and relish a deep pinch of snuff.  It was my\nfirst thought to drop from the wall upon the other side.  A glance\nsufficed to show me that even the way by which I had come was now cut\noff, and the field behind me already occupied by a couple of shepherds’\nassistants and a score or two of sheep.  I have named the talismans on\nwhich I habitually depend, but here was a conjuncture in which both were\nwholly useless.  The copestone of a wall arrayed with broken bottles is\nno favourable rostrum; and I might be as eloquent as Pitt, and as\nfascinating as Richelieu, and neither the gardener nor the shepherd lads\nwould care a halfpenny.  In short, there was no escape possible from my\nabsurd position: there I must continue to sit until one or other of my\nneighbours should raise his eyes and give the signal for my capture.\n\nThe part of the wall on which (for my sins) I was posted could be scarce\nless than twelve feet high on the inside; the leaves of the beech which\nmade a fashion of sheltering me were already partly fallen; and I was\nthus not only perilously exposed myself, but enabled to command some part\nof the garden walks and (under an evergreen arch) the front lawn and\nwindows of the cottage.  For long nothing stirred except my friend with\nthe spade; then I heard the opening of a sash; and presently after saw\nMiss Flora appear in a morning wrapper and come strolling hitherward\nbetween the borders, pausing and visiting her flowers—herself as fair.\n_There_ was a friend; _here_, immediately beneath me, an unknown\nquantity—the gardener: how to communicate with the one and not attract\nthe notice of the other?  To make a noise was out of the question; I\ndared scarce to breathe.  I held myself ready to make a gesture as soon\nas she should look, and she looked in every possible direction but the\none.  She was interested in the vilest tuft of chickweed, she gazed at\nthe summit of the mountain, she came even immediately below me and\nconversed on the most fastidious topics with the gardener; but to the top\nof that wall she would not dedicate a glance!  At last she began to\nretrace her steps in the direction of the cottage; whereupon, becoming\nquite desperate, I broke off a piece of plaster, took a happy aim, and\nhit her with it in the nape of the neck.  She clapped her hand to the\nplace, turned about, looked on all sides for an explanation, and spying\nme (as indeed I was parting the branches to make it the more easy), half\nuttered and half swallowed down again a cry of surprise.\n\nThe infernal gardener was erect upon the instant.  ‘What’s your wull,\nmiss?’ said he.\n\nHer readiness amazed me.  She had already turned and was gazing in the\nopposite direction.  ‘There’s a child among the artichokes,’ she said.\n\n‘The Plagues of Egyp’!  _I’ll_ see to them!’ cried the gardener\ntruculently, and with a hurried waddle disappeared among the evergreens.\n\nThat moment she turned, she came running towards me, her arms stretched\nout, her face incarnadined for the one moment with heavenly blushes, the\nnext pale as death.  ‘Monsieur de. Saint-Yves!’ she said.\n\n‘My dear young lady,’ I said, ‘this is the damnedest liberty—I know it!\nBut what else was I to do?’\n\n‘You have escaped?’ said she.\n\n‘If you call this escape,’ I replied.\n\n‘But you cannot possibly stop there!’ she cried.\n\n‘I know it,’ said I.  ‘And where am I to go?’\n\nShe struck her hands together.  ‘I have it!’ she exclaimed.  ‘Come down\nby the beech trunk—you must leave no footprint in the border—quickly,\nbefore Robie can get back!  I am the hen-wife here: I keep the key; you\nmust go into the hen-house—for the moment.’\n\nI was by her side at once.  Both cast a hasty glance at the blank windows\nof the cottage and so much as was visible of the garden alleys; it seemed\nthere was none to observe us.  She caught me by the sleeve and ran.  It\nwas no time for compliments; hurry breathed upon our necks; and I ran\nalong with her to the next corner of the garden, where a wired court and\na board hovel standing in a grove of trees advertised my place of refuge.\nShe thrust me in without a word; the bulk of the fowls were at the same\ntime emitted; and I found myself the next moment locked in alone with\nhalf a dozen sitting hens.  In the twilight of the place all fixed their\neyes on me severely, and seemed to upbraid me with some crying\nimpropriety.  Doubtless the hen has always a puritanic appearance,\nalthough (in its own behaviour) I could never observe it to be more\nparticular than its neighbours.  But conceive a British hen!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—THE HEN-HOUSE\n\n\nI was half an hour at least in the society of these distressing bipeds,\nand alone with my own reflections and necessities.  I was in great pain\nof my flayed hands, and had nothing to treat them with; I was hungry and\nthirsty, and had nothing to eat or to drink; I was thoroughly tired, and\nthere was no place for me to sit.  To be sure there was the floor, but\nnothing could be imagined less inviting.\n\nAt the sound of approaching footsteps, my good-humour was restored.  The\nkey rattled in the lock, and Master Ronald entered, closed the door\nbehind him, and leaned his back to it.\n\n‘I say, you know!’ he said, and shook a sullen young head.\n\n‘I know it’s a liberty,’ said I.\n\n‘It’s infernally awkward: my position is infernally embarrassing,’ said\nhe.\n\n‘Well,’ said I, ‘and what do you think of mine?’\n\nThis seemed to pose him entirely, and he remained gazing upon me with a\nconvincing air of youth and innocence.  I could have laughed, but I was\nnot so inhumane.\n\n‘I am in your hands,’ said I, with a little gesture.  ‘You must do with\nme what you think right.’\n\n‘Ah, yes!’ he cried: ‘if I knew!’\n\n‘You see,’ said I, ‘it would be different if you had received your\ncommission.  Properly speaking, you are not yet a combatant; I have\nceased to be one; and I think it arguable that we are just in the\nposition of one ordinary gentleman to another, where friendship usually\ncomes before the law.  Observe, I only say _arguable_.  For God’s sake,\ndon’t think I wish to dictate an opinion.  These are the sort of nasty\nlittle businesses, inseparable from war, which every gentleman must\ndecide for himself.  If I were in your place—’\n\n‘Ay, what would you do, then?’ says he.\n\n‘Upon my word, I do not know,’ said I.  ‘Hesitate, as you are doing, I\nbelieve.’\n\n‘I will tell you,’ he said.  ‘I have a kinsman, and it is what _he_ would\nthink, that I am thinking.  It is General Graham of Lynedoch—Sir Thomas\nGraham.  I scarcely know him, but I believe I admire him more than I do\nGod.’\n\n‘I admire him a good deal myself,’ said I, ‘and have good reason to.  I\nhave fought with him, been beaten, and run away.  _Veni_, _victus sum_,\n_evasi_.’\n\n‘What!’ he cried.  ‘You were at Barossa?’\n\n‘There and back, which many could not say,’ said I.  ‘It was a pretty\naffair and a hot one, and the Spaniards behaved abominably, as they\nusually did in a pitched field; the Marshal Duke of Belluno made a fool\nof himself, and not for the first time; and your friend Sir Thomas had\nthe best of it, so far as there was any best.  He is a brave and ready\nofficer.’\n\n‘Now, then, you will understand!’ said the boy.  ‘I wish to please Sir\nThomas: what would he do?’\n\n‘Well, I can tell you a story,’ said I, ‘a true one too, and about this\nvery combat of Chiclana, or Barossa as you call it.  I was in the Eighth\nof the Line; we lost the eagle of the First Battalion, more betoken, but\nit cost you dear.  Well, we had repulsed more charges than I care to\ncount, when your 87th Regiment came on at a foot’s pace, very slow but\nvery steady; in front of them a mounted officer, his hat in his hand,\nwhite-haired, and talking very quietly to the battalions.  Our Major,\nVigo-Roussillon, set spurs to his horse and galloped out to sabre him,\nbut seeing him an old man, very handsome, and as composed as if he were\nin a coffee-house, lost heart and galloped back again.  Only, you see,\nthey had been very close together for the moment, and looked each other\nin the eyes.  Soon after the Major was wounded, taken prisoner, and\ncarried into Cadiz.  One fine day they announced to him the visit of the\nGeneral, Sir Thomas Graham.  “Well, sir,” said the General, taking him by\nthe hand, “I think we were face to face upon the field.”  It was the\nwhite-haired officer!’\n\n‘Ah!’ cried the boy,—his eyes were burning.\n\n‘Well, and here is the point,’ I continued.  ‘Sir Thomas fed the Major\nfrom his own table from that day, and served him with six covers.’\n\n‘Yes, it is a beautiful—a beautiful story,’ said Ronald.  ‘And yet\nsomehow it is not the same—is it?’\n\n‘I admit it freely,’ said I.\n\nThe boy stood awhile brooding.  ‘Well, I take my risk of it,’ he cried.\n‘I believe it’s treason to my sovereign—I believe there is an infamous\npunishment for such a crime—and yet I’m hanged if I can give you up.’\n\nI was as much moved as he.  ‘I could almost beg you to do otherwise,’ I\nsaid.  ‘I was a brute to come to you, a brute and a coward.  You are a\nnoble enemy; you will make a noble soldier.’  And with rather a happy\nidea of a compliment for this warlike youth, I stood up straight and gave\nhim the salute.\n\nHe was for a moment confused; his face flushed.  ‘Well, well, I must be\ngetting you something to eat, but it will not be for six,’ he added, with\na smile: ‘only what we can get smuggled out.  There is my aunt in the\nroad, you see,’ and he locked me in again with the indignant hens.\n\nI always smile when I recall that young fellow; and yet, if the reader\nwere to smile also, I should feel ashamed.  If my son shall be only like\nhim when he comes to that age, it will be a brave day for me and not a\nbad one for his country.\n\nAt the same time I cannot pretend that I was sorry when his sister\nsucceeded in his place.  She brought me a few crusts of bread and a jug\nof milk, which she had handsomely laced with whisky after the Scottish\nmanner.\n\n‘I am so sorry,’ she said: ‘I dared not bring on anything more.  We are\nso small a family, and my aunt keeps such an eye upon the servants.  I\nhave put some whisky in the milk—it is more wholesome so—and with eggs\nyou will be able to make something of a meal.  How many eggs will you be\nwanting to that milk? for I must be taking the others to my aunt—that is\nmy excuse for being here.  I should think three or four.  Do you know how\nto beat them? or shall I do it?’\n\nWilling to detain her a while longer in the hen-house, I displayed my\nbleeding palms; at which she cried aloud.\n\n‘My dear Miss Flora, you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs,’\nsaid I; ‘and it is no bagatelle to escape from Edinburgh Castle.  One of\nus, I think, was even killed.’\n\n‘And you are as white as a rag, too,’ she exclaimed, ‘and can hardly\nstand!  Here is my shawl, sit down upon it here in the corner, and I will\nbeat your eggs.  See, I have brought a fork too; I should have been a\ngood person to take care of Jacobites or Covenanters in old days!  You\nshall have more to eat this evening; Ronald is to bring it you from town.\nWe have money enough, although no food that we can call our own.  Ah, if\nRonald and I kept house, you should not be lying in this shed!  He\nadmires you so much.’\n\n‘My dear friend,’ said I, ‘for God’s sake do not embarrass me with more\nalms.  I loved to receive them from that hand, so long as they were\nneeded; but they are so no more, and whatever else I may lack—and I lack\neverything—it is not money.’  I pulled out my sheaf of notes and detached\nthe top one: it was written for ten pounds, and signed by that very\nfamous individual, Abraham Newlands.  ‘Oblige me, as you would like me to\noblige your brother if the parts were reversed, and take this note for\nthe expenses.  I shall need not only food, but clothes.’\n\n‘Lay it on the ground,’ said she.  ‘I must not stop my beating.’\n\n‘You are not offended?’ I exclaimed.\n\nShe answered me by a look that was a reward in itself, and seemed to\nimply the most heavenly offers for the future.  There was in it a shadow\nof reproach, and such warmth of communicative cordiality as left me\nspeechless.  I watched her instead till her hens’ milk was ready.\n\n‘Now,’ said she, ‘taste that.’\n\nI did so, and swore it was nectar.  She collected her eggs and crouched\nin front of me to watch me eat.  There was about this tall young lady at\nthe moment an air of motherliness delicious to behold.  I am like the\nEnglish general, and to this day I still wonder at my moderation.\n\n‘What sort of clothes will you be wanting?’ said she.\n\n‘The clothes of a gentleman,’ said I.  ‘Right or wrong, I think it is the\npart I am best qualified to play.  Mr. St. Ives (for that’s to be my name\nupon the journey) I conceive as rather a theatrical figure, and his\nmake-up should be to match.’\n\n‘And yet there is a difficulty,’ said she.  ‘If you got coarse clothes\nthe fit would hardly matter.  But the clothes of a fine gentleman—O, it\nis absolutely necessary that these should fit!  And above all, with\nyour’—she paused a moment—‘to our ideas somewhat noticeable manners.’\n\n‘Alas for my poor manners!’ said I.  ‘But my dear friend Flora, these\nlittle noticeabilities are just what mankind has to suffer under.\nYourself, you see, you’re very noticeable even when you come in a crowd\nto visit poor prisoners in the Castle.’\n\nI was afraid I should frighten my good angel visitant away, and without\nthe smallest breath of pause went on to add a few directions as to stuffs\nand colours.\n\nShe opened big eyes upon me.  ‘O, Mr. St. Ives!’ she cried—‘if that is to\nbe your name—I do not say they would not be becoming; but for a journey,\ndo you think they would be wise?  I am afraid’—she gave a pretty break of\nlaughter—‘I am afraid they would be daft-like!’\n\n‘Well, and am I not daft?’ I asked her.\n\n‘I do begin to think you are,’ said she.\n\n‘There it is, then!’ said I.  ‘I have been long enough a figure of fun.\nCan you not feel with me that perhaps the bitterest thing in this\ncaptivity has been the clothes?  Make me a captive—bind me with chains if\nyou like—but let me be still myself.  You do not know what it is to be a\nwalking travesty—among foes,’ I added bitterly.\n\n‘O, but you are too unjust!’ she cried.  ‘You speak as though any one\never dreamed of laughing at you.  But no one did.  We were all pained to\nthe heart.  Even my aunt—though sometimes I do think she was not quite in\ngood taste—you should have seen her and heard her at home!  She took so\nmuch interest.  Every patch in your clothes made us sorry; it should have\nbeen a sister’s work.’\n\n‘That is what I never had—a sister,’ said I.  ‘But since you say that I\ndid not make you laugh—’\n\n‘O, Mr. St. Ives! never!’ she exclaimed.  ‘Not for one moment.  It was\nall too sad.  To see a gentleman—’\n\n‘In the clothes of a harlequin, and begging?’ I suggested.\n\n‘To see a gentleman in distress, and nobly supporting it,’ she said.\n\n‘And do you not understand, my fair foe,’ said I, ‘that even if all were\nas you say—even if you had thought my travesty were becoming—I should be\nonly the more anxious, for my sake, for my country’s sake, and for the\nsake of your kindness, that you should see him whom you have helped as\nGod meant him to be seen? that you should have something to remember him\nby at least more characteristic than a misfitting sulphur-yellow suit,\nand half a week’s beard?’\n\n‘You think a great deal too much of clothes,’ she said.  ‘I am not that\nkind of girl.’\n\n‘And I am afraid I am that kind of man,’ said I.  ‘But do not think of me\ntoo harshly for that.  I talked just now of something to remember by.  I\nhave many of them myself, of these beautiful reminders, of these\nkeepsakes, that I cannot be parted from until I lose memory and life.\nMany of them are great things, many of them are high virtues—charity,\nmercy, faith.  But some of them are trivial enough.  Miss Flora, do you\nremember the day that I first saw you, the day of the strong east wind?\nMiss Flora, shall I tell you what you wore?’\n\nWe had both risen to our feet, and she had her hand already on the door\nto go.  Perhaps this attitude emboldened me to profit by the last seconds\nof our interview; and it certainly rendered her escape the more easy.\n\n‘O, you are too romantic!’ she said, laughing; and with that my sun was\nblown out, my enchantress had fled away, and I was again left alone in\nthe twilight with the lady hens.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—THREE IS COMPANY, AND FOUR NONE\n\n\nThe rest of the day I slept in the corner of the hen-house upon Flora’s\nshawl.  Nor did I awake until a light shone suddenly in my eyes, and\nstarting up with a gasp (for, indeed, at the moment I dreamed I was still\nswinging from the Castle battlements) I found Ronald bending over me with\na lantern.  It appeared it was past midnight, that I had slept about\nsixteen hours, and that Flora had returned her poultry to the shed and I\nhad heard her not.  I could not but wonder if she had stooped to look at\nme as I slept.  The puritan hens now slept irremediably; and being\ncheered with the promise of supper I wished them an ironical good-night,\nand was lighted across the garden and noiselessly admitted to a bedroom\non the ground floor of the cottage.  There I found soap, water,\nrazors—offered me diffidently by my beardless host—and an outfit of new\nclothes.  To be shaved again without depending on the barber of the gaol\nwas a source of a delicious, if a childish joy.  My hair was sadly too\nlong, but I was none so unwise as to make an attempt on it myself.  And,\nindeed, I thought it did not wholly misbecome me as it was, being by\nnature curly.  The clothes were about as good as I expected.  The\nwaistcoat was of toilenet, a pretty piece, the trousers of fine\nkerseymere, and the coat sat extraordinarily well.  Altogether, when I\nbeheld this changeling in the glass, I kissed my hand to him.\n\n‘My dear fellow,’ said I, ‘have you no scent?’\n\n‘Good God, no!’ cried Ronald.  ‘What do you want with scent?’\n\n‘Capital thing on a campaign,’ said I.  ‘But I can do without.’\n\nI was now led, with the same precautions against noise, into the little\nbow-windowed dining-room of the cottage.  The shutters were up, the lamp\nguiltily turned low; the beautiful Flora greeted me in a whisper; and\nwhen I was set down to table, the pair proceeded to help me with\nprecautions that might have seemed excessive in the Ear of Dionysius.\n\n‘She sleeps up there,’ observed the boy, pointing to the ceiling; and the\nknowledge that I was so imminently near to the resting-place of that gold\neyeglass touched even myself with some uneasiness.\n\nOur excellent youth had imported from the city a meat pie, and I was glad\nto find it flanked with a decanter of really admirable wine of Oporto.\nWhile I ate, Ronald entertained me with the news of the city, which had\nnaturally rung all day with our escape: troops and mounted messengers had\nfollowed each other forth at all hours and in all directions; but\naccording to the last intelligence no recapture had been made.  Opinion\nin town was very favourable to us: our courage was applauded, and many\nprofessed regret that our ultimate chance of escape should be so small.\nThe man who had fallen was one Sombref, a peasant; he was one who slept\nin a different part of the Castle; and I was thus assured that the whole\nof my former companions had attained their liberty, and Shed A was\nuntenanted.\n\nFrom this we wandered insensibly into other topics.  It is impossible to\nexaggerate the pleasure I took to be thus sitting at the same table with\nFlora, in the clothes of a gentleman, at liberty and in the full\npossession of my spirits and resources; of all of which I had need,\nbecause it was necessary that I should support at the same time two\nopposite characters, and at once play the cavalier and lively soldier for\nthe eyes of Ronald, and to the ears of Flora maintain the same profound\nand sentimental note that I had already sounded.  Certainly there are\ndays when all goes well with a man; when his wit, his digestion, his\nmistress are in a conspiracy to spoil him, and even the weather smiles\nupon his wishes.  I will only say of myself upon that evening that I\nsurpassed my expectations, and was privileged to delight my hosts.\nLittle by little they forgot their terrors and I my caution; until at\nlast we were brought back to earth by a catastrophe that might very\neasily have been foreseen, but was not the less astonishing to us when it\noccurred.\n\nI had filled all the glasses.  ‘I have a toast to propose,’ I whispered,\n‘or rather three, but all so inextricably interwoven that they will not\nbear dividing.  I wish first to drink to the health of a brave and\ntherefore a generous enemy.  He found me disarmed, a fugitive and\nhelpless.  Like the lion, he disdained so poor a triumph; and when he\nmight have vindicated an easy valour, he preferred to make a friend.  I\nwish that we should next drink to a fairer and a more tender foe.  She\nfound me in prison; she cheered me with a priceless sympathy; what she\nhas done since, I know she has done in mercy, and I only pray—I dare\nscarce hope—her mercy may prove to have been merciful.  And I wish to\nconjoin with these, for the first, and perhaps the last time, the\nhealth—and I fear I may already say the memory—of one who has fought, not\nalways without success, against the soldiers of your nation; but who came\nhere, vanquished already, only to be vanquished again by the loyal hand\nof the one, by the unforgettable eyes of the other.’\n\nIt is to be feared I may have lent at times a certain resonancy to my\nvoice; it is to be feared that Ronald, who was none the better for his\nown hospitality, may have set down his glass with something of a clang.\nWhatever may have been the cause, at least, I had scarce finished my\ncompliment before we were aware of a thump upon the ceiling overhead.  It\nwas to be thought some very solid body had descended to the floor from\nthe level (possibly) of a bed.  I have never seen consternation painted\nin more lively colours than on the faces of my hosts.  It was proposed to\nsmuggle me forth into the garden, or to conceal my form under a horsehair\nsofa which stood against the wall.  For the first expedient, as was now\nplain by the approaching footsteps, there was no longer time; from the\nsecond I recoiled with indignation.\n\n‘My dear creatures,’ said I, ‘let us die, but do not let us be\nridiculous.’\n\nThe words were still upon my lips when the door opened and my friend of\nthe gold eyeglass appeared, a memorable figure, on the threshold.  In one\nhand she bore a bedroom candlestick; in the other, with the steadiness of\na dragoon, a horse-pistol.  She was wound about in shawls which did not\nwholly conceal the candid fabric of her nightdress, and surmounted by a\nnightcap of portentous architecture.  Thus accoutred, she made her\nentrance; laid down the candle and pistol, as no longer called for;\nlooked about the room with a silence more eloquent than oaths; and then,\nin a thrilling voice—‘To whom have I the pleasure?’ she said, addressing\nme with a ghost of a bow.\n\n‘Madam, I am charmed, I am sure,’ said I.  ‘The story is a little long;\nand our meeting, however welcome, was for the moment entirely unexpected\nby myself.  I am sure—’ but here I found I was quite sure of nothing, and\ntried again.  ‘I have the honour,’ I began, and found I had the honour to\nbe only exceedingly confused.  With that, I threw myself outright upon\nher mercy.  ‘Madam, I must be more frank with you,’ I resumed.  ‘You have\nalready proved your charity and compassion for the French prisoners, I am\none of these; and if my appearance be not too much changed, you may even\nyet recognise in me that _Oddity_ who had the good fortune more than once\nto make you smile.’\n\nStill gazing upon me through her glass, she uttered an uncompromising\ngrunt; and then, turning to her niece—‘Flora,’ said she, ‘how comes he\nhere?’\n\nThe culprits poured out for a while an antiphony of explanations, which\ndied out at last in a miserable silence.\n\n‘I think at least you might have told your aunt,’ she snorted.\n\n‘Madam,’ I interposed, ‘they were about to do so.  It is my fault if it\nbe not done already.  But I made it my prayer that your slumbers might be\nrespected, and this necessary formula of my presentation should be\ndelayed until to-morrow in the morning.’\n\nThe old lady regarded me with undissembled incredulity, to which I was\nable to find no better repartee than a profound and I trust graceful\nreverence.\n\n‘French prisoners are very well in their place,’ she said, ‘but I cannot\nsee that their place is in my private dining-room.’\n\n‘Madam,’ said I, ‘I hope it may be said without offence, but (except the\nCastle of Edinburgh) I cannot think upon the spot from which I would so\nreadily be absent.’\n\nAt this, to my relief, I thought I could perceive a vestige of a smile to\nsteal upon that iron countenance and to be bitten immediately in.\n\n‘And if it is a fair question, what do they call ye?’ she asked.\n\n‘At your service, the Vicomte Anne de St.-Yves,’ said I.\n\n‘Mosha the Viscount,’ said she, ‘I am afraid you do us plain people a\ngreat deal too much honour.’\n\n‘My dear lady,’ said I, ‘let us be serious for a moment.  What was I to\ndo?  Where was I to go?  And how can you be angry with these benevolent\nchildren who took pity on one so unfortunate as myself?  Your humble\nservant is no such terrific adventurer that you should come out against\nhim with horse-pistol and’—smiling—‘bedroom candlesticks.  It is but a\nyoung gentleman in extreme distress, hunted upon every side, and asking\nno more than to escape from his pursuers.  I know your character, I read\nit in your face’—the heart trembled in my body as I said these daring\nwords.  ‘There are unhappy English prisoners in France at this day,\nperhaps at this hour.  Perhaps at this hour they kneel as I do; they take\nthe hand of her who might conceal and assist them; they press it to their\nlips as I do—’\n\n‘Here, here!’ cried the old lady, breaking from my solicitations.\n‘Behave yourself before folk!  Saw ever anyone the match of that?  And on\nearth, my dears, what are we to do with him?’\n\n‘Pack him off, my dear lady,’ said I: ‘pack off the impudent fellow\ndouble-quick!  And if it may be, and if your good heart allows it, help\nhim a little on the way he has to go.’\n\n‘What’s this pie?’ she cried stridently.  ‘Where is this pie from,\nFlora?’\n\nNo answer was vouchsafed by my unfortunate and (I may say) extinct\naccomplices.\n\n‘Is that my port?’ she pursued.  ‘Hough!  Will somebody give me a glass\nof my port wine?’\n\nI made haste to serve her.\n\nShe looked at me over the rim with an extraordinary expression.  ‘I hope\nye liked it?’ said she.\n\n‘It is even a magnificent wine,’ said I.\n\n‘Aweel, it was my father laid it down,’ said she.  ‘There were few knew\nmore about port wine than my father, God rest him!’  She settled herself\nin a chair with an alarming air of resolution.  ‘And so there is some\nparticular direction that you wish to go in?’ said she.\n\n‘O,’ said I, following her example, ‘I am by no means such a vagrant as\nyou suppose.  I have good friends, if I could get to them, for which all\nI want is to be once clear of Scotland; and I have money for the road.’\nAnd I produced my bundle.\n\n‘English bank-notes?’ she said.  ‘That’s not very handy for Scotland.\nIt’s been some fool of an Englishman that’s given you these, I’m\nthinking.  How much is it?’\n\n‘I declare to heaven I never thought to count!’ I exclaimed.  ‘But that\nis soon remedied.’\n\nAnd I counted out ten notes of ten pound each, all in the name of Abraham\nNewlands, and five bills of country bankers for as many guineas.\n\n‘One hundred and twenty six pound five,’ cried the old lady.  ‘And you\ncarry such a sum about you, and have not so much as counted it!  If you\nare not a thief, you must allow you are very thief-like.’\n\n‘And yet, madam, the money is legitimately mine,’ said I.\n\nShe took one of the bills and held it up.  ‘Is there any probability,\nnow, that this could be traced?’ she asked.\n\n‘None, I should suppose; and if it were, it would be no matter,’ said I.\n‘With your usual penetration, you guessed right.  An Englishman brought\nit me.  It reached me, through the hands of his English solicitor, from\nmy great-uncle, the Comte de Kéroual de Saint-Yves, I believe the richest\n_émigré_ in London.’\n\n‘I can do no more than take your word for it,’ said she.\n\n‘And I trust, madam, not less,’ said I.\n\n‘Well,’ said she, ‘at this rate the matter may be feasible.  I will cash\none of these five-guinea bills, less the exchange, and give you silver\nand Scots notes to bear you as far as the border.  Beyond that, Mosha the\nViscount, you will have to depend upon yourself.’\n\nI could not but express a civil hesitation as to whether the amount would\nsuffice, in my case, for so long a journey.\n\n‘Ay,’ said she, ‘but you havenae heard me out.  For if you are not too\nfine a gentleman to travel with a pair of drovers, I believe I have found\nthe very thing, and the Lord forgive me for a treasonable old wife!\nThere are a couple stopping up by with the shepherd-man at the farm;\nto-morrow they will take the road for England, probably by skriegh of\nday—and in my opinion you had best be travelling with the stots,’ said\nshe.\n\n‘For Heaven’s sake do not suppose me to be so effeminate a character!’ I\ncried.  ‘An old soldier of Napoleon is certainly beyond suspicion.  But,\ndear lady, to what end? and how is the society of these excellent\ngentlemen supposed to help me?’\n\n‘My dear sir,’ said she, ‘you do not at all understand your own\npredicament, and must just leave your matters in the hands of those who\ndo.  I dare say you have never even heard tell of the drove-roads or the\ndrovers; and I am certainly not going to sit up all night to explain it\nto you.  Suffice it, that it is me who is arranging this affair—the more\nshame to me!—and that is the way ye have to go.  Ronald,’ she continued,\n‘away up-by to the shepherds; rowst them out of their beds, and make it\nperfectly distinct that Sim is not to leave till he has seen me.’\n\nRonald was nothing loath to escape from his aunt’s neighbourhood, and\nleft the room and the cottage with a silent expedition that was more like\nflight than mere obedience.  Meanwhile the old lady turned to her niece.\n\n‘And I would like to know what we are to do with him the night!’ she\ncried.\n\n‘Ronald and I meant to put him in the hen-house,’ said the encrimsoned\nFlora.\n\n‘And I can tell you he is to go to no such a place,’ replied the aunt.\n‘Hen-house, indeed!  If a guest he is to be, he shall sleep in no mortal\nhen-house.  Your room is the most fit, I think, if he will consent to\noccupy it on so great a suddenty.  And as for you, Flora, you shall sleep\nwith me.’\n\nI could not help admiring the prudence and tact of this old dowager, and\nof course it was not for me to make objections.  Ere I well knew how, I\nwas alone with a flat candlestick, which is not the most sympathetic of\ncompanions, and stood studying the snuff in a frame of mind between\ntriumph and chagrin.  All had gone well with my flight: the masterful\nlady who had arrogated to herself the arrangement of the details gave me\nevery confidence; and I saw myself already arriving at my uncle’s door.\nBut, alas! it was another story with my love affair.  I had seen and\nspoken with her alone; I had ventured boldly; I had been not ill\nreceived; I had seen her change colour, had enjoyed the undissembled\nkindness of her eyes; and now, in a moment, down comes upon the scene\nthat apocalyptic figure with the nightcap and the horse-pistol, and with\nthe very wind of her coming behold me separated from my love!  Gratitude\nand admiration contended in my breast with the extreme of natural\nrancour.  My appearance in her house at past midnight had an air (I could\nnot disguise it from myself) that was insolent and underhand, and could\nnot but minister to the worst suspicions.  And the old lady had taken it\nwell.  Her generosity was no more to be called in question than her\ncourage, and I was afraid that her intelligence would be found to match.\nCertainly, Miss Flora had to support some shrewd looks, and certainly she\nhad been troubled.  I could see but the one way before me: to profit by\nan excellent bed, to try to sleep soon, to be stirring early, and to hope\nfor some renewed occasion in the morning.  To have said so much and yet\nto say no more, to go out into the world upon so half-hearted a parting,\nwas more than I could accept.\n\nIt is my belief that the benevolent fiend sat up all night to baulk me.\nShe was at my bedside with a candle long ere day, roused me, laid out for\nme a damnable misfit of clothes, and bade me pack my own (which were\nwholly unsuited to the journey) in a bundle.  Sore grudging, I arrayed\nmyself in a suit of some country fabric, as delicate as sackcloth and\nabout as becoming as a shroud; and, on coming forth, found the dragon had\nprepared for me a hearty breakfast.  She took the head of the table,\npoured out the tea, and entertained me as I ate with a great deal of good\nsense and a conspicuous lack of charm.  How often did I not regret the\nchange!—how often compare her, and condemn her in the comparison, with\nher charming niece!  But if my entertainer was not beautiful, she had\ncertainly been busy in my interest.  Already she was in communication\nwith my destined fellow-travellers; and the device on which she had\nstruck appeared entirely suitable.  I was a young Englishman who had\noutrun the constable; warrants were out against me in Scotland, and it\nhad become needful I should pass the border without loss of time, and\nprivately.\n\n‘I have given a very good account of you,’ said she, ‘which I hope you\nmay justify.  I told them there was nothing against you beyond the fact\nthat you were put to the haw (if that is the right word) for debt.’\n\n‘I pray God you have the expression incorrectly, ma’am,’ said I.  ‘I do\nnot give myself out for a person easily alarmed; but you must admit there\nis something barbarous and mediaeval in the sound well qualified to\nstartle a poor foreigner.’\n\n‘It is the name of a process in Scots Law, and need alarm no honest man,’\nsaid she.  ‘But you are a very idle-minded young gentleman; you must\nstill have your joke, I see: I only hope you will have no cause to regret\nit.’\n\n‘I pray you not to suppose, because I speak lightly, that I do not feel\ndeeply,’ said I.  ‘Your kindness has quite conquered me; I lay myself at\nyour disposition, I beg you to believe, with real tenderness; I pray you\nto consider me from henceforth as the most devoted of your friends.’\n\n‘Well, well,’ she said, ‘here comes your devoted friend the drover.  I’m\nthinking he will be eager for the road; and I will not be easy myself\ntill I see you well off the premises, and the dishes washed, before my\nservant-woman wakes.  Praise God, we have gotten one that is a treasure\nat the sleeping!’\n\nThe morning was already beginning to be blue in the trees of the garden,\nand to put to shame the candle by which I had breakfasted.  The lady rose\nfrom table, and I had no choice but to follow her example.  All the time\nI was beating my brains for any means by which I should be able to get a\nword apart with Flora, or find the time to write her a billet.  The\nwindows had been open while I breakfasted, I suppose to ventilate the\nroom from any traces of my passage there; and, Master Ronald appearing on\nthe front lawn, my ogre leaned forth to address him.\n\n‘Ronald,’ she said, ‘wasn’t that Sim that went by the wall?’\n\nI snatched my advantage.  Right at her back there was pen, ink, and paper\nlaid out.  I wrote: ‘I love you’; and before I had time to write more, or\nso much as to blot what I had written, I was again under the guns of the\ngold eyeglasses.\n\n‘It’s time,’ she began; and then, as she observed my occupation, ‘Umph!’\nshe broke off.  ‘Ye have something to write?’ she demanded.\n\n‘Some notes, madam,’ said I, bowing with alacrity.\n\n‘Notes,’ she said; ‘or a note?’\n\n‘There is doubtless some _finesse_ of the English language that I do not\ncomprehend,’ said I.\n\n‘I’ll contrive, however, to make my meaning very plain to ye, Mosha le\nViscount,’ she continued.  ‘I suppose you desire to be considered a\ngentleman?’\n\n‘Can you doubt it, madam?’ said I.\n\n‘I doubt very much, at least, whether you go to the right way about it,’\nshe said.  ‘You have come here to me, I cannot very well say how; I think\nyou will admit you owe me some thanks, if it was only for the breakfast I\nmade ye.  But what are you to me?  A waif young man, not so far to seek\nfor looks and manners, with some English notes in your pocket and a price\nupon your head.  I am a lady; I have been your hostess, with however\nlittle will; and I desire that this random acquaintance of yours with my\nfamily will cease and determine.’\n\nI believe I must have coloured.  ‘Madam,’ said I, ‘the notes are of no\nimportance; and your least pleasure ought certainly to be my law.  You\nhave felt, and you have been pleased to express, a doubt of me.  I tear\nthem up.’  Which you may be sure I did thoroughly.\n\n‘There’s a good lad!’ said the dragon, and immediately led the way to the\nfront lawn.\n\nThe brother and sister were both waiting us here, and, as well as I could\nmake out in the imperfect light, bore every appearance of having passed\nthrough a rather cruel experience.  Ronald seemed ashamed to so much as\ncatch my eye in the presence of his aunt, and was the picture of\nembarrassment.  As for Flora, she had scarce the time to cast me one look\nbefore the dragon took her by the arm, and began to march across the\ngarden in the extreme first glimmer of the dawn without exchanging\nspeech.  Ronald and I followed in equal silence.\n\nThere was a door in that same high wall on the top of which I had sat\nperched no longer gone than yesterday morning.  This the old lady set\nopen with a key; and on the other side we were aware of a rough-looking,\nthick-set man, leaning with his arms (through which was passed a\nformidable staff) on a dry-stone dyke.  Him the old lady immediately\naddressed.\n\n‘Sim,’ said she, ‘this is the young gentleman.’\n\nSim replied with an inarticulate grumble of sound, and a movement of one\narm and his head, which did duty for a salutation.\n\n‘Now, Mr. St. Ives,’ said the old lady, ‘it’s high time for you to be\ntaking the road.  But first of all let me give the change of your\nfive-guinea bill.  Here are four pounds of it in British Linen notes, and\nthe balance in small silver, less sixpence.  Some charge a shilling, I\nbelieve, but I have given you the benefit of the doubt.  See and guide it\nwith all the sense that you possess.’\n\n‘And here, Mr. St. Ives,’ said Flora, speaking for the first time, ‘is a\nplaid which you will find quite necessary on so rough a journey.  I hope\nyou will take it from the hands of a Scotch friend,’ she added, and her\nvoice trembled.\n\n‘Genuine holly: I cut it myself,’ said Ronald, and gave me as good a\ncudgel as a man could wish for in a row.\n\nThe formality of these gifts, and the waiting figure of the driver, told\nme loudly that I must be gone.  I dropped on one knee and bade farewell\nto the aunt, kissing her hand.  I did the like—but with how different a\npassion!—to her niece; as for the boy, I took him to my arms and embraced\nhim with a cordiality that seemed to strike him speechless.  ‘Farewell!’\nand ‘Farewell!’ I said.  ‘I shall never forget my friends.  Keep me\nsometimes in memory.  Farewell!’ With that I turned my back and began to\nwalk away; and had scarce done so, when I heard the door in the high wall\nclose behind me.  Of course this was the aunt’s doing; and of course, if\nI know anything of human character, she would not let me go without some\ntart expressions.  I declare, even if I had heard them, I should not have\nminded in the least, for I was quite persuaded that, whatever admirers I\nmight be leaving behind me in Swanston Cottage, the aunt was not the\nleast sincere.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X—THE DROVERS\n\n\nIt took me a little effort to come abreast of my new companion; for\nthough he walked with an ugly roll and no great appearance of speed, he\ncould cover the around at a good rate when he wanted to.  Each looked at\nthe other: I with natural curiosity, he with a great appearance of\ndistaste.  I have heard since that his heart was entirely set against me;\nhe had seen me kneel to the ladies, and diagnosed me for a ‘gesterin’\neediot.’\n\n‘So, ye’re for England, are ye?’ said he.\n\nI told him yes.\n\n‘Weel, there’s waur places, I believe,’ was his reply; and he relapsed\ninto a silence which was not broken during a quarter of an hour of steady\nwalking.\n\nThis interval brought us to the foot of a bare green valley, which wound\nupwards and backwards among the hills.  A little stream came down the\nmidst and made a succession of clear pools; near by the lowest of which I\nwas aware of a drove of shaggy cattle, and a man who seemed the very\ncounterpart of Mr. Sim making a breakfast upon bread and cheese.  This\nsecond drover (whose name proved to be Candlish) rose on our approach.\n\n‘Here’s a mannie that’s to gang through with us,’ said Sim.  ‘It was the\nauld wife, Gilchrist, wanted it.’\n\n‘Aweel, aweel,’ said the other; and presently, remembering his manners,\nand looking on me with a solemn grin, ‘A fine day!’ says he.\n\nI agreed with him, and asked him how he did.\n\n‘Brawly,’ was the reply; and without further civilities, the pair\nproceeded to get the cattle under way.  This, as well as almost all the\nherding, was the work of a pair of comely and intelligent dogs, directed\nby Sim or Candlish in little more than monosyllables.  Presently we were\nascending the side of the mountain by a rude green track, whose presence\nI had not hitherto observed.  A continual sound of munching and the\ncrying of a great quantity of moor birds accompanied our progress, which\nthe deliberate pace and perennial appetite of the cattle rendered\nwearisomely slow.  In the midst my two conductors marched in a contented\nsilence that I could not but admire.  The more I looked at them, the more\nI was impressed by their absurd resemblance to each other.  They were\ndressed in the same coarse homespun, carried similar sticks, were equally\nbegrimed about the nose with snuff, and each wound in an identical plaid\nof what is called the shepherd’s tartan.  In a back view they might be\ndescribed as indistinguishable; and even from the front they were much\nalike.  An incredible coincidence of humours augmented the impression.\nThrice and four times I attempted to pave the way for some exchange of\nthought, sentiment, or—at the least of it—human words.  An _Ay_ or an\n_Nhm_ was the sole return, and the topic died on the hill-side without\necho.  I can never deny that I was chagrined; and when, after a little\nmore walking, Sim turned towards me and offered me a ram’s horn of snuff,\nwith the question ‘Do ye use it?’ I answered, with some animation,\n‘Faith, sir, I would use pepper to introduce a little cordiality.’  But\neven this sally failed to reach, or at least failed to soften, my\ncompanions.\n\nAt this rate we came to the summit of a ridge, and saw the track descend\nin front of us abruptly into a desert vale, about a league in length, and\nclosed at the farther end by no less barren hilltops.  Upon this point of\nvantage Sim came to a halt, took off his hat, and mopped his brow.\n\n‘Weel,’ he said, ‘here we’re at the top o’ Howden.’\n\n‘The top o’ Howden, sure eneuch,’ said Candlish.\n\n‘Mr. St. Ivey, are ye dry?’ said the first.\n\n‘Now, really,’ said I, ‘is not this Satan reproving sin?’\n\n‘What ails ye, man?’ said he.  ‘I’m offerin’ ye a dram.’\n\n‘Oh, if it be anything to drink,’ said I, ‘I am as dry as my neighbours.’\n\nWhereupon Sim produced from the corner of his plaid a black bottle, and\nwe all drank and pledged each other.  I found these gentlemen followed\nupon such occasions an invariable etiquette, which you may be certain I\nmade haste to imitate.  Each wiped his mouth with the back of his left\nhand, held up the bottle in his right, remarked with emphasis, ‘Here’s to\nye!’ and swallowed as much of the spirit as his fancy prompted.  This\nlittle ceremony, which was the nearest thing to manners I could perceive\nin either of my companions, was repeated at becoming intervals, generally\nafter an ascent.  Occasionally we shared a mouthful of ewe-milk cheese\nand an inglorious form of bread, which I understood (but am far from\nengaging my honour on the point) to be called ‘shearer’s bannock.’  And\nthat may be said to have concluded our whole active intercourse for the\nfirst day.\n\nI had the more occasion to remark the extraordinarily desolate nature of\nthat country, through which the drove road continued, hour after hour and\neven day after day, to wind.  A continual succession of insignificant\nshaggy hills, divided by the course of ten thousand brooks, through which\nwe had to wade, or by the side of which we encamped at night; infinite\nperspectives of heather, infinite quantities of moorfowl; here and there,\nby a stream side, small and pretty clumps of willows or the silver birch;\nhere and there, the ruins of ancient and inconsiderable fortresses—made\nthe unchanging characters of the scene.  Occasionally, but only in the\ndistance, we could perceive the smoke of a small town or of an isolated\nfarmhouse or cottage on the moors; more often, a flock of sheep and its\nattendant shepherd, or a rude field of agriculture perhaps not yet\nharvested.  With these alleviations, we might almost be said to pass\nthrough an unbroken desert—sure, one of the most impoverished in Europe;\nand when I recalled to mind that we were yet but a few leagues from the\nchief city (where the law courts sat every day with a press of business,\nsoldiers garrisoned the castle, and men of admitted parts were carrying\non the practice of letters and the investigations of science), it gave me\na singular view of that poor, barren, and yet illustrious country through\nwhich I travelled.  Still more, perhaps, did it commend the wisdom of\nMiss Gilchrist in sending me with these uncouth companions and by this\nunfrequented path.\n\nMy itinerary is by no means clear to me; the names and distances I never\nclearly knew, and have now wholly forgotten; and this is the more to be\nregretted as there is no doubt that, in the course of those days, I must\nhave passed and camped among sites which have been rendered illustrious\nby the pen of Walter Scott.  Nay, more, I am of opinion that I was still\nmore favoured by fortune, and have actually met and spoken with that\ninimitable author.  Our encounter was of a tall, stoutish, elderly\ngentleman, a little grizzled, and of a rugged but cheerful and engaging\ncountenance.  He sat on a hill pony, wrapped in a plaid over his green\ncoat, and was accompanied by a horse-woman, his daughter, a young lady of\nthe most charming appearance.  They overtook us on a stretch of heath,\nreined up as they came alongside, and accompanied us for perhaps a\nquarter of an hour before they galloped off again across the hillsides to\nour left.  Great was my amazement to find the unconquerable Mr. Sim thaw\nimmediately on the accost of this strange gentleman, who hailed him with\na ready familiarity, proceeded at once to discuss with him the trade of\ndroving and the prices of cattle, and did not disdain to take a pinch\nfrom the inevitable ram’s horn.  Presently I was aware that the\nstranger’s eye was directed on myself; and there ensued a conversation,\nsome of which I could not help overhearing at the time, and the rest have\npieced together more or less plausibly from the report of Sim.\n\n‘Surely that must be an _amateur drover_ ye have gotten there?’ the\ngentleman seems to have asked.\n\nSim replied, I was a young gentleman that had a reason of his own to\ntravel privately.\n\n‘Well, well, ye must tell me nothing of that.  I am in the law, you know,\nand _tace_ is the Latin for a candle,’ answered the gentleman.  ‘But I\nhope it’s nothing bad.’\n\nSim told him it was no more than debt.\n\n‘Oh, Lord, if that be all!’ cried the gentleman; and turning to myself,\n‘Well, sir,’ he added, ‘I understand you are taking a tramp through our\nforest here for the pleasure of the thing?’\n\n‘Why, yes, sir,’ said I; ‘and I must say I am very well entertained.’\n\n‘I envy you,’ said he.  ‘I have jogged many miles of it myself when I was\nyounger.  My youth lies buried about here under every heather-bush, like\nthe soul of the licentiate Lucius.  But you should have a guide.  The\npleasure of this country is much in the legends, which grow as plentiful\nas blackberries.’  And directing my attention to a little fragment of a\nbroken wall no greater than a tombstone, he told me for an example a\nstory of its earlier inhabitants.  Years after it chanced that I was one\nday diverting myself with a Waverley Novel, when what should I come upon\nbut the identical narrative of my green-coated gentleman upon the moors!\nIn a moment the scene, the tones of his voice, his northern accent, and\nthe very aspect of the earth and sky and temperature of the weather,\nflashed back into my mind with the reality of dreams.  The unknown in the\ngreen-coat had been the Great Unknown!  I had met Scott; I had heard a\nstory from his lips; I should have been able to write, to claim\nacquaintance, to tell him that his legend still tingled in my ears.  But\nthe discovery came too late, and the great man had already succumbed\nunder the load of his honours and misfortunes.\n\nPresently, after giving us a cigar apiece, Scott bade us farewell and\ndisappeared with his daughter over the hills.  And when I applied to Sim\nfor information, his answer of ‘The Shirra, man!  A’body kens the\nShirra!’ told me, unfortunately, nothing.\n\nA more considerable adventure falls to be related.  We were now near the\nborder.  We had travelled for long upon the track beaten and browsed by a\nmillion herds, our predecessors, and had seen no vestige of that traffic\nwhich had created it.  It was early in the morning when we at last\nperceived, drawing near to the drove road, but still at a distance of\nabout half a league, a second caravan, similar to but larger than our\nown.  The liveliest excitement was at once exhibited by both my comrades.\nThey climbed hillocks, they studied the approaching drove from under\ntheir hand, they consulted each other with an appearance of alarm that\nseemed to me extraordinary.  I had learned by this time that their\nstand-off manners implied, at least, no active enmity; and I made bold to\nask them what was wrong.\n\n‘Bad yins,’ was Sim’s emphatic answer.\n\nAll day the dogs were kept unsparingly on the alert, and the drove pushed\nforward at a very unusual and seemingly unwelcome speed.  All day Sim and\nCandlish, with a more than ordinary expenditure both of snuff and of\nwords, continued to debate the position.  It seems that they had\nrecognised two of our neighbours on the road—one Faa, and another by the\nname of Gillies.  Whether there was an old feud between them still\nunsettled I could never learn; but Sim and Candlish were prepared for\nevery degree of fraud or violence at their hands.  Candlish repeatedly\ncongratulated himself on having left ‘the watch at home with the\nmistress’; and Sim perpetually brandished his cudgel, and cursed his\nill-fortune that it should be sprung.\n\n‘I willna care a damn to gie the daashed scoon’rel a fair clout wi’ it,’\nhe said.  ‘The daashed thing micht come sindry in ma hand.’\n\n‘Well, gentlemen,’ said I, ‘suppose they do come on, I think we can give\na very good account of them.’  And I made my piece of holly, Ronald’s\ngift, the value of which I now appreciated, sing about my head.\n\n‘Ay, man?  Are ye stench?’ inquired Sim, with a gleam of approval in his\nwooden countenance.\n\nThe same evening, somewhat wearied with our day-long expedition, we\nencamped on a little verdant mound, from the midst of which there welled\na spring of clear water scarce great enough to wash the hands in.  We had\nmade our meal and lain down, but were not yet asleep, when a growl from\none of the collies set us on the alert.  All three sat up, and on a\nsecond impulse all lay down again, but now with our cudgels ready.  A man\nmust be an alien and an outlaw, an old soldier and a young man in the\nbargain, to take adventure easily.  With no idea as to the rights of the\nquarrel or the probable consequences of the encounter, I was as ready to\ntake part with my two drovers, as ever to fall in line on the morning of\na battle.  Presently there leaped three men out of the heather; we had\nscarce time to get to our feet before we were assailed; and in a moment\neach one of us was engaged with an adversary whom the deepening twilight\nscarce permitted him to see.  How the battle sped in other quarters I am\nin no position to describe.  The rogue that fell to my share was\nexceedingly agile and expert with his weapon; had and held me at a\ndisadvantage from the first assault; forced me to give ground\ncontinually, and at last, in mere self-defence, to let him have the\npoint.  It struck him in the throat, and he went down like a ninepin and\nmoved no more.\n\nIt seemed this was the signal for the engagement to be discontinued.  The\nother combatants separated at once; our foes were suffered, without\nmolestation, to lift up and bear away their fallen comrade; so that I\nperceived this sort of war to be not wholly without laws of chivalry, and\nperhaps rather to partake of the character of a tournament than of a\nbattle _à outrance_.  There was no doubt, at least, that I was supposed\nto have pushed the affair too seriously.  Our friends the enemy removed\ntheir wounded companion with undisguised consternation; and they were no\nsooner over the top of the brae, than Sim and Candlish roused up their\nwearied drove and set forth on a night march.\n\n‘I’m thinking Faa’s unco bad,’ said the one.\n\n‘Ay,’ said the other, ‘he lookit dooms gash.’\n\n‘He did that,’ said the first.\n\nAnd their weary silence fell upon them again.\n\nPresently Sim turned to me.  ‘Ye’re unco ready with the stick,’ said he.\n\n‘Too ready, I’m afraid,’ said I.  ‘I am afraid Mr. Faa (if that be his\nname) has got his gruel.’\n\n‘Weel, I wouldnae wonder,’ replied Sim.\n\n‘And what is likely to happen?’ I inquired.\n\n‘Aweel,’ said Sim, snuffing profoundly, ‘if I were to offer an opeenion,\nit would not be conscientious.  For the plain fac’ is, Mr. St. Ivy, that\nI div not ken.  We have had crackit heids—and rowth of them—ere now; and\nwe have had a broken leg or maybe twa; and the like of that we drover\nbodies make a kind of a practice like to keep among oursel’s.  But a corp\nwe have none of us ever had to deal with, and I could set nae leemit to\nwhat Gillies micht consider proper in the affair.  Forbye that, he would\nbe in raither a hobble himsel’, if he was to gang hame wantin’ Faa.  Folk\nare awfu’ throng with their questions, and parteecularly when they’re no\nwantit.’\n\n‘That’s a fac’,’ said Candlish.\n\nI considered this prospect ruefully; and then making the best of it,\n‘Upon all which accounts,’ said I, ‘the best will be to get across the\nborder and there separate.  If you are troubled, you can very truly put\nthe blame upon your late companion; and if I am pursued, I must just try\nto keep out of the way.’\n\n‘Mr. St. Ivy,’ said Sim, with something resembling enthusiasm, ‘no’ a\nword mair!  I have met in wi’ mony kinds o’ gentry ere now; I hae seen o’\nthem that was the tae thing, and I hae seen o’ them that was the tither;\nbut the wale of a gentleman like you I have no sae very frequently seen\nthe bate of.’\n\nOur night march was accordingly pursued with unremitting diligence.  The\nstars paled, the east whitened, and we were still, both dogs and men,\ntoiling after the wearied cattle.  Again and again Sim and Candlish\nlamented the necessity: it was ‘fair ruin on the bestial,’ they declared;\nbut the thought of a judge and a scaffold hunted them ever forward.  I\nmyself was not so much to be pitied.  All that night, and during the\nwhole of the little that remained before us of our conjunct journey, I\nenjoyed a new pleasure, the reward of my prowess, in the now loosened\ntongue of Mr. Sim.  Candlish was still obdurately taciturn: it was the\nman’s nature; but Sim, having finally appraised and approved me,\ndisplayed without reticence a rather garrulous habit of mind and a pretty\ntalent for narration.  The pair were old and close companions,\nco-existing in these endless moors in a brotherhood of silence such as I\nhave heard attributed to the trappers of the west.  It seems absurd to\nmention love in connection with so ugly and snuffy a couple; at least,\ntheir trust was absolute; and they entertained a surprising admiration\nfor each other’s qualities; Candlish exclaiming that Sim was ‘grand\ncompany!’ and Sim frequently assuring me in an aside that for ‘a rale,\nauld, stench bitch, there was nae the bate of Candlish in braid\nScotland.’  The two dogs appeared to be entirely included in this family\ncompact, and I remarked that their exploits and traits of character were\nconstantly and minutely observed by the two masters.  Dog stories\nparticularly abounded with them; and not only the dogs of the present but\nthose of the past contributed their quota.  ‘But that was naething,’ Sim\nwould begin: ‘there was a herd in Manar, they ca’d him Tweedie—ye’ll mind\nTweedie, Can’lish?’  ‘Fine, that!’ said Candlish.  ‘Aweel, Tweedie had a\ndog—’  The story I have forgotten; I dare say it was dull, and I suspect\nit was not true; but indeed, my travels with the drove rendered me\nindulgent, and perhaps even credulous, in the matter of dog stories.\nBeautiful, indefatigable beings! as I saw them at the end of a long day’s\njourney frisking, barking, bounding, striking attitudes, slanting a bushy\ntail, manifestly playing to the spectator’s eye, manifestly rejoicing in\ntheir grace and beauty—and turned to observe Sim and Candlish\nunornamentally plodding in the rear with the plaids about their bowed\nshoulders and the drop at their snuffy nose—I thought I would rather\nclaim kinship with the dogs than with the men!  My sympathy was\nunreturned; in their eyes I was a creature light as air; and they would\nscarce spare me the time for a perfunctory caress or perhaps a hasty lap\nof the wet tongue, ere they were back again in sedulous attendance on\nthose dingy deities, their masters—and their masters, as like as not,\ndamning their stupidity.\n\nAltogether the last hours of our tramp were infinitely the most agreeable\nto me, and I believe to all of us; and by the time we came to separate,\nthere had grown up a certain familiarity and mutual esteem that made the\nparting harder.  It took place about four of the afternoon on a bare\nhillside from which I could see the ribbon of the great north road,\nhenceforth to be my conductor.  I asked what was to pay.\n\n‘Naething,’ replied Sim.\n\n‘What in the name of folly is this?’ I exclaimed.  ‘You have led me, you\nhave fed me, you have filled me full of whisky, and now you will take\nnothing!’\n\n‘Ye see we indentit for that,’ replied Sim.\n\n ‘Indented?’ I repeated; ‘what does the man mean?’\n\n‘Mr. St. Ivy,’ said Sim, ‘this is a maitter entirely between Candlish and\nme and the auld wife, Gilchrist.  You had naething to say to it; weel, ye\ncan have naething to do with it, then.’\n\n‘My good man,’ said I, ‘I can allow myself to be placed in no such\nridiculous position.  Mrs. Gilchrist is nothing to me, and I refuse to be\nher debtor.’\n\n‘I dinna exac’ly see what way ye’re gaun to help it,’ observed my drover.\n\n‘By paying you here and now,’ said I.\n\n‘There’s aye twa to a bargain, Mr. St. Ives,’ said he.\n\n‘You mean that you will not take it?’ said I.\n\n‘There or thereabout,’ said he.  ‘Forbye, that it would set ye a heap\nbetter to keep your siller for them you awe it to.  Ye’re young, Mr. St.\nIvy, and thoughtless; but it’s my belief that, wi’ care and\ncircumspection, ye may yet do credit to yoursel’.  But just you bear this\nin mind: that him that _awes_ siller should never _gie_ siller.’\n\nWell, what was there to say?  I accepted his rebuke, and bidding the pair\nfarewell, set off alone upon my southward way.\n\n‘Mr. St. Ivy,’ was the last word of Sim, ‘I was never muckle ta’en up in\nEnglishry; but I think that I really ought to say that ye seem to me to\nhave the makings of quite a decent lad.’\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI—THE GREAT NORTH ROAD\n\n\nIt chanced that as I went down the hill these last words of my friend the\ndrover echoed not unfruitfully in my head.  I had never told these men\nthe least particulars as to my race or fortune, as it was a part, and the\nbest part, of their civility to ask no questions: yet they had dubbed me\nwithout hesitation English.  Some strangeness in the accent they had\ndoubtless thus explained.  And it occurred to me, that if I could pass in\nScotland for an Englishman, I might be able to reverse the process and\npass in England for a Scot.  I thought, if I was pushed to it, I could\nmake a struggle to imitate the brogue; after my experience with Candlish\nand Sim, I had a rich provision of outlandish words at my command; and I\nfelt I could tell the tale of Tweedie’s dog so as to deceive a native.\nAt the same time, I was afraid my name of St. Ives was scarcely suitable;\ntill I remembered there was a town so called in the province of Cornwall,\nthought I might yet be glad to claim it for my place of origin, and\ndecided for a Cornish family and a Scots education.  For a trade, as I\nwas equally ignorant of all, and as the most innocent might at any moment\nbe the means of my exposure, it was best to pretend to none.  And I\ndubbed myself a young gentleman of a sufficient fortune and an idle,\ncurious habit of mind, rambling the country at my own charges, in quest\nof health, information, and merry adventures.\n\nAt Newcastle, which was the first town I reached, I completed my\npreparations for the part, before going to the inn, by the purchase of a\nknapsack and a pair of leathern gaiters.  My plaid I continued to wear\nfrom sentiment.  It was warm, useful to sleep in if I were again\nbenighted, and I had discovered it to be not unbecoming for a man of\ngallant carriage.  Thus equipped, I supported my character of the\nlight-hearted pedestrian not amiss.  Surprise was indeed expressed that I\nshould have selected such a season of the year; but I pleaded some delays\nof business, and smilingly claimed to be an eccentric.  The devil was in\nit, I would say, if any season of the year was not good enough for me; I\nwas not made of sugar, I was no mollycoddle to be afraid of an ill-aired\nbed or a sprinkle of snow; and I would knock upon the table with my fist\nand call for t’other bottle, like the noisy and free-hearted young\ngentleman I was.  It was my policy (if I may so express myself) to talk\nmuch and say little.  At the inn tables, the country, the state of the\nroads, the business interest of those who sat down with me, and the\ncourse of public events, afforded me a considerable field in which I\nmight discourse at large and still communicate no information about\nmyself.  There was no one with less air of reticence; I plunged into my\ncompany up to the neck; and I had a long cock-and-bull story of an aunt\nof mine which must have convinced the most suspicious of my innocence.\n‘What!’ they would have said, ‘that young ass to be concealing anything!\nWhy, he has deafened me with an aunt of his until my head aches.  He only\nwants you should give him a line, and he would tell you his whole descent\nfrom Adam downward, and his whole private fortune to the last shilling.’\nA responsible solid fellow was even so much moved by pity for my\ninexperience as to give me a word or two of good advice: that I was but a\nyoung man after all—I had at this time a deceptive air of youth that made\nme easily pass for one-and-twenty, and was, in the circumstances, worth a\nfortune—that the company at inns was very mingled, that I should do well\nto be more careful, and the like; to all which I made answer that I meant\nno harm myself and expected none from others, or the devil was in it.\n‘You are one of those d---d prudent fellows that I could never abide\nwith,’ said I.  ‘You are the kind of man that has a long head.  That’s\nall the world, my dear sir: the long-heads and the short-horns!  Now, I\nam a short-horn.’  ‘I doubt,’ says he, ‘that you will not go very far\nwithout getting sheared.’  I offered to bet with him on that, and he made\noff, shaking his head.\n\nBut my particular delight was to enlarge on politics and the war.  None\ndamned the French like me; none was more bitter against the Americans.\nAnd when the north-bound mail arrived, crowned with holly, and the\ncoachman and guard hoarse with shouting victory, I went even so far as to\nentertain the company to a bowl of punch, which I compounded myself with\nno illiberal hand, and doled out to such sentiments as the following:—\n\n‘Our glorious victory on the Nivelle’!  ‘Lord Wellington, God bless him!\nand may victory ever attend upon his arms!’ and, ‘Soult, poor devil! and\nmay he catch it again to the same tune!’\n\nNever was oratory more applauded to the echo—never any one was more of\nthe popular man than I.  I promise you, we made a night of it.  Some of\nthe company supported each other, with the assistance of boots, to their\nrespective bedchambers, while the rest slept on the field of glory where\nwe had left them; and at the breakfast table the next morning there was\nan extraordinary assemblage of red eyes and shaking fists.  I observed\npatriotism to burn much lower by daylight.  Let no one blame me for\ninsensibility to the reverses of France!  God knows how my heart raged.\nHow I longed to fall on that herd of swine and knock their heads together\nin the moment of their revelry!  But you are to consider my own situation\nand its necessities; also a certain lightheartedness, eminently Gallic,\nwhich forms a leading trait in my character, and leads me to throw myself\ninto new circumstances with the spirit of a schoolboy.  It is possible\nthat I sometimes allowed this impish humour to carry me further than good\ntaste approves: and I was certainly punished for it once.\n\nThis was in the episcopal city of Durham.  We sat down, a considerable\ncompany, to dinner, most of us fine old vatted English tories of that\nclass which is often so enthusiastic as to be inarticulate.  I took and\nheld the lead from the beginning; and, the talk having turned on the\nFrench in the Peninsula, I gave them authentic details (on the authority\nof a cousin of mine, an ensign) of certain cannibal orgies in Galicia, in\nwhich no less a person than General Caffarelli had taken a part.  I\nalways disliked that commander, who once ordered me under arrest for\ninsubordination; and it is possible that a spice of vengeance added to\nthe rigour of my picture.  I have forgotten the details; no doubt they\nwere high-coloured.  No doubt I rejoiced to fool these jolter-heads; and\nno doubt the sense of security that I drank from their dull, gasping\nfaces encouraged me to proceed extremely far.  And for my sins, there was\none silent little man at table who took my story at the true value.  It\nwas from no sense of humour, to which he was quite dead.  It was from no\nparticular intelligence, for he had not any.  The bond of sympathy, of\nall things in the world, had rendered him clairvoyant.\n\nDinner was no sooner done than I strolled forth into the streets with\nsome design of viewing the cathedral; and the little man was silently at\nmy heels.  A few doors from the inn, in a dark place of the street, I was\naware of a touch on my arm, turned suddenly, and found him looking up at\nme with eyes pathetically bright.\n\n‘I beg your pardon, sir; but that story of yours was particularly rich.\nHe—he!  Particularly racy,’ said he.  ‘I tell you, sir, I took you\nwholly!  I _smoked_ you!  I believe you and I, sir, if we had a chance to\ntalk, would find we had a good many opinions in common.  Here is the\n“Blue Bell,” a very comfortable place.  They draw good ale, sir.  Would\nyou be so condescending as to share a pot with me?’\n\nThere was something so ambiguous and secret in the little man’s perpetual\nsignalling, that I confess my curiosity was much aroused.  Blaming\nmyself, even as I did so, for the indiscretion, I embraced his proposal,\nand we were soon face to face over a tankard of mulled ale.  He lowered\nhis voice to the least attenuation of a whisper.\n\n‘Here, sir,’ said he, ‘is to the Great Man.  I think you take me?  No?’\nHe leaned forward till our noses touched.  ‘Here is to the Emperor!’ said\nhe.\n\nI was extremely embarrassed, and, in spite of the creature’s innocent\nappearance, more than half alarmed.  I thought him too ingenious, and,\nindeed, too daring for a spy.  Yet if he were honest he must be a man of\nextraordinary indiscretion, and therefore very unfit to be encouraged by\nan escaped prisoner.  I took a half course, accordingly—accepted his\ntoast in silence, and drank it without enthusiasm.\n\nHe proceeded to abound in the praises of Napoleon, such as I had never\nheard in France, or at least only on the lips of officials paid to offer\nthem.\n\n‘And this Caffarelli, now,’ he pursued: ‘he is a splendid fellow, too, is\nhe not?  I have not heard vastly much of him myself.  No details, sir—no\ndetails!  We labour under huge difficulties here as to unbiassed\ninformation.’\n\n‘I believe I have heard the same complaint in other countries,’ I could\nnot help remarking.  ‘But as to Caffarelli, he is neither lame nor blind,\nhe has two legs and a nose in the middle of his face.  And I care as much\nabout him as you care for the dead body of Mr. Perceval!’\n\nHe studied me with glowing eyes.\n\n‘You cannot deceive me!’ he cried.  ‘You have served under him.  You are\na Frenchman!  I hold by the hand, at last, one of that noble race, the\npioneers of the glorious principles of liberty and brotherhood.  Hush!\nNo, it is all right.  I thought there had been somebody at the door.  In\nthis wretched, enslaved country we dare not even call our souls our own.\nThe spy and the hangman, sir—the spy and the hangman!  And yet there is a\ncandle burning, too.  The good leaven is working, sir—working underneath.\nEven in this town there are a few brave spirits, who meet every\nWednesday.  You must stay over a day or so, and join us.  We do not use\nthis house.  Another, and a quieter.  They draw fine ale, however—fair,\nmild ale.  You will find yourself among friends, among brothers.  You\nwill hear some very daring sentiments expressed!’ he cried, expanding his\nsmall chest.  ‘Monarchy, Christianity—all the trappings of a bloated\npast—the Free Confraternity of Durham and Tyneside deride.’\n\nHere was a devil of a prospect for a gentleman whose whole design was to\navoid observation!  The Free Confraternity had no charms for me; daring\nsentiments were no part of my baggage; and I tried, instead, a little\ncold water.\n\n‘You seem to forget, sir, that my Emperor has re-established\nChristianity,’ I observed.\n\n‘Ah, sir, but that was policy!’ he exclaimed.  ‘You do not understand\nNapoleon.  I have followed his whole career.  I can explain his policy\nfrom first to last.  Now for instance in the Peninsula, on which you were\nso very amusing, if you will come to a friend’s house who has a map of\nSpain, I can make the whole course of the war quite clear to you, I\nventure to say, in half an hour.’\n\nThis was intolerable.  Of the two extremes, I found I preferred the\nBritish tory; and, making an appointment for the morrow, I pleaded sudden\nheadache, escaped to the inn, packed my knapsack, and fled, about nine at\nnight, from this accursed neighbourhood.  It was cold, starry, and clear,\nand the road dry, with a touch of frost.  For all that, I had not the\nsmallest intention to make a long stage of it; and about ten o’clock,\nspying on the right-hand side of the way the lighted windows of an\nalehouse, I determined to bait there for the night.\n\nIt was against my principle, which was to frequent only the dearest inns;\nand the misadventure that befell me was sufficient to make me more\nparticular in the future.  A large company was assembled in the parlour,\nwhich was heavy with clouds of tobacco smoke, and brightly lighted up by\na roaring fire of coal.  Hard by the chimney stood a vacant chair in what\nI thought an enviable situation, whether for warmth or the pleasure of\nsociety; and I was about to take it, when the nearest of the company\nstopped me with his hand.\n\n‘Beg thy pardon, sir,’ said he; ‘but that there chair belongs to a\nBritish soldier.’\n\nA chorus of voices enforced and explained.  It was one of Lord\nWellington’s heroes.  He had been wounded under Rowland Hill.  He was\nColbourne’s right-hand man.  In short, this favoured individual appeared\nto have served with every separate corps, and under every individual\ngeneral in the Peninsula.  Of course I apologised.  I had not known.  The\ndevil was in it if a soldier had not a right to the best in England.  And\nwith that sentiment, which was loudly applauded, I found a corner of a\nbench, and awaited, with some hopes of entertainment, the return of the\nhero.  He proved, of course, to be a private soldier.  I say of course,\nbecause no officer could possibly enjoy such heights of popularity.  He\nhad been wounded before San Sebastian, and still wore his arm in a sling.\nWhat was a great deal worse for him, every member of the company had been\nplying him with drink.  His honest yokel’s countenance blazed as if with\nfever, his eyes were glazed and looked the two ways, and his feet\nstumbled as, amidst a murmur of applause, he returned to the midst of his\nadmirers.\n\nTwo minutes afterwards I was again posting in the dark along the highway;\nto explain which sudden movement of retreat I must trouble the reader\nwith a reminiscence of my services.\n\nI lay one night with the out-pickets in Castile.  We were in close touch\nwith the enemy; the usual orders had been issued against smoking, fires,\nand talk, and both armies lay as quiet as mice, when I saw the English\nsentinel opposite making a signal by holding up his musket.  I repeated\nit, and we both crept together in the dry bed of a stream, which made the\ndemarcation of the armies.  It was wine he wanted, of which we had a good\nprovision, and the English had quite run out.  He gave me the money, and\nI, as was the custom, left him my firelock in pledge, and set off for the\ncanteen.  When I returned with a skin of wine, behold, it had pleased\nsome uneasy devil of an English officer to withdraw the outposts!  Here\nwas a situation with a vengeance, and I looked for nothing but ridicule\nin the present and punishment in the future.  Doubtless our officers\nwinked pretty hard at this interchange of courtesies, but doubtless it\nwould be impossible to wink at so gross a fault, or rather so pitiable a\nmisadventure as mine; and you are to conceive me wandering in the plains\nof Castile, benighted, charged with a wine-skin for which I had no use,\nand with no knowledge whatever of the whereabouts of my musket, beyond\nthat it was somewhere in my Lord Wellington’s army.  But my Englishman\nwas either a very honest fellow, or else extremely thirsty, and at last\ncontrived to advertise me of his new position.  Now, the English sentry\nin Castile, and the wounded hero in the Durham public-house, were one and\nthe same person; and if he had been a little less drunk, or myself less\nlively in getting away, the travels of M. St. Ives might have come to an\nuntimely end.\n\nI suppose this woke me up; it stirred in me besides a spirit of\nopposition, and in spite of cold, darkness, the highwaymen and the\nfootpads, I determined to walk right on till breakfast-time: a happy\nresolution, which enabled me to observe one of those traits of manners\nwhich at once depict a country and condemn it.  It was near midnight when\nI saw, a great way ahead of me, the light of many torches; presently\nafter, the sound of wheels reached me, and the slow tread of feet, and\nsoon I had joined myself to the rear of a sordid, silent, and lugubrious\nprocession, such as we see in dreams.  Close on a hundred persons marched\nby torchlight in unbroken silence; in their midst a cart, and in the\ncart, on an inclined platform, the dead body of a man—the centre-piece of\nthis solemnity, the hero whose obsequies we were come forth at this\nunusual hour to celebrate.  It was but a plain, dingy old fellow of fifty\nor sixty, his throat cut, his shirt turned over as though to show the\nwound.  Blue trousers and brown socks completed his attire, if we can\ntalk so of the dead.  He had a horrid look of a waxwork.  In the tossing\nof the lights he seemed to make faces and mouths at us, to frown, and to\nbe at times upon the point of speech.  The cart, with this shabby and\ntragic freight, and surrounded by its silent escort and bright torches,\ncontinued for some distance to creak along the high-road, and I to follow\nit in amazement, which was soon exchanged for horror.  At the corner of a\nlane the procession stopped, and, as the torches ranged themselves along\nthe hedgerow-side, I became aware of a grave dug in the midst of the\nthoroughfare, and a provision of quicklime piled in the ditch.  The cart\nwas backed to the margin, the body slung off the platform and dumped into\nthe grave with an irreverent roughness.  A sharpened stake had hitherto\nserved it for a pillow.  It was now withdrawn, held in its place by\nseveral volunteers, and a fellow with a heavy mallet (the sound of which\nstill haunts me at night) drove it home through the bosom of the corpse.\nThe hole was filled with quicklime, and the bystanders, as if relieved of\nsome oppression, broke at once into a sound of whispered speech.\n\nMy shirt stuck to me, my heart had almost ceased beating, and I found my\ntongue with difficulty.\n\n‘I beg your pardon,’ I gasped to a neighbour, ‘what is this? what has he\ndone? is it allowed?’\n\n‘Why, where do you come from?’ replied the man.\n\n‘I am a traveller, sir,’ said I, ‘and a total stranger in this part of\nthe country.  I had lost my way when I saw your torches, and came by\nchance on this—this incredible scene.  Who was the man?’\n\n‘A suicide,’ said he.  ‘Ay, he was a bad one, was Johnnie Green.’\n\nIt appeared this was a wretch who had committed many barbarous murders,\nand being at last upon the point of discovery fell of his own hand.  And\nthe nightmare at the crossroads was the regular punishment, according to\nthe laws of England, for an act which the Romans honoured as a virtue!\nWhenever an Englishman begins to prate of civilisation (as, indeed, it’s\na defect they are rather prone to), I hear the measured blows of a\nmallet, see the bystanders crowd with torches about the grave, smile a\nlittle to myself in conscious superiority—and take a thimbleful of brandy\nfor the stomach’s sake.\n\nI believe it must have been at my next stage, for I remember going to bed\nextremely early, that I came to the model of a good old-fashioned English\ninn, and was attended on by the picture of a pretty chambermaid.  We had\na good many pleasant passages as she waited table or warmed my bed for me\nwith a devil of a brass warming pan, fully larger than herself; and as\nshe was no less pert than she was pretty, she may be said to have given\nrather better than she took.  I cannot tell why (unless it were for the\nsake of her saucy eyes), but I made her my confidante, told her I was\nattached to a young lady in Scotland, and received the encouragement of\nher sympathy, mingled and connected with a fair amount of rustic wit.\nWhile I slept the down-mail stopped for supper; it chanced that one of\nthe passengers left behind a copy of the _Edinburgh Courant_, and the\nnext morning my pretty chambermaid set the paper before me at breakfast,\nwith the remark that there was some news from my lady-love.  I took it\neagerly, hoping to find some further word of our escape, in which I was\ndisappointed; and I was about to lay it down, when my eye fell on a\nparagraph immediately concerning me.  Faa was in hospital, grievously\nsick, and warrants were out for the arrest of Sim and Candlish.  These\ntwo men had shown themselves very loyal to me.  This trouble emerging,\nthe least I could do was to be guided by a similar loyalty to them.\nSuppose my visit to my uncle crowned with some success, and my finances\nre-established, I determined I should immediately return to Edinburgh,\nput their case in the hands of a good lawyer, and await events.  So my\nmind was very lightly made up to what proved a mighty serious matter.\nCandlish and Sim were all very well in their way, and I do sincerely\ntrust I should have been at some pains to help them, had there been\nnothing else.  But in truth my heart and my eyes were set on quite\nanother matter, and I received the news of their tribulation almost with\njoy.  That is never a bad wind that blows where we want to go, and you\nmay be sure there was nothing unwelcome in a circumstance that carried me\nback to Edinburgh and Flora.  From that hour I began to indulge myself\nwith the making of imaginary scenes and interviews, in which I confounded\nthe aunt, flattered Ronald, and now in the witty, now in the sentimental\nmanner, declared my love and received the assurance of its return.  By\nmeans of this exercise my resolution daily grew stronger, until at last I\nhad piled together such a mass of obstinacy as it would have taken a\ncataclysm of nature to subvert.\n\n‘Yes,’ said I to the chambermaid, ‘here is news of my lady-love indeed,\nand very good news too.’\n\nAll that day, in the teeth of a keen winter wind, I hugged myself in my\nplaid, and it was as though her arms were flung around me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII—I FOLLOW A COVERED CART NEARLY TO MY DESTINATION\n\n\nAt last I began to draw near, by reasonable stages, to the neighbourhood\nof Wakefield; and the name of Mr. Burchell Fenn came to the top in my\nmemory.  This was the gentleman (the reader may remember) who made a\ntrade of forwarding the escape of French prisoners.  How he did so:\nwhether he had a sign-board, _Escapes forwarded_, _apply within_; what he\ncharged for his services, or whether they were gratuitous and charitable,\nwere all matters of which I was at once ignorant and extremely curious.\nThanks to my proficiency in English, and Mr. Romaine’s bank-notes, I was\ngetting on swimmingly without him; but the trouble was that I could not\nbe easy till I had come to the bottom of these mysteries, and it was my\ndifficulty that I knew nothing of him beyond the name.  I knew not his\ntrade beyond that of Forwarder of Escapes—whether he lived in town or\ncountry, whether he were rich or poor, nor by what kind of address I was\nto gain his confidence.  It would have a very bad appearance to go along\nthe highwayside asking after a man of whom I could give so scanty an\naccount; and I should look like a fool, indeed, if I were to present\nmyself at his door and find the police in occupation!  The interest of\nthe conundrum, however, tempted me, and I turned aside from my direct\nroad to pass by Wakefield; kept my ears pricked, as I went, for any\nmention of his name, and relied for the rest on my good fortune.  If Luck\n(who must certainly be feminine) favoured me as far as to throw me in the\nman’s way, I should owe the lady a candle; if not, I could very readily\nconsole myself.  In this experimental humour, and with so little to help\nme, it was a miracle that I should have brought my enterprise to a good\nend; and there are several saints in the calendar who might be happy to\nexchange with St. Ives!\n\nI had slept that night in a good inn at Wakefield, made my breakfast by\ncandle-light with the passengers of an up-coach, and set off in a very\nill temper with myself and my surroundings.  It was still early; the air\nraw and cold; the sun low, and soon to disappear under a vast canopy of\nrain-clouds that had begun to assemble in the north-west, and from that\nquarter invaded the whole width of the heaven.  Already the rain fell in\ncrystal rods; already the whole face of the country sounded with the\ndischarge of drains and ditches; and I looked forward to a day of\ndownpour and the hell of wet clothes, in which particular I am as dainty\nas a cat.  At a corner of the road, and by the last glint of the drowning\nsun, I spied a covered cart, of a kind that I thought I had never seen\nbefore, preceding me at the foot’s pace of jaded horses.  Anything is\ninteresting to a pedestrian that can help him to forget the miseries of a\nday of rain; and I bettered my pace and gradually overtook the vehicle.\n\nThe nearer I came, the more it puzzled me.  It was much such a cart as I\nam told the calico printers use, mounted on two wheels, and furnished\nwith a seat in front for the driver.  The interior closed with a door,\nand was of a bigness to contain a good load of calico, or (at a pinch and\nif it were necessary) four or five persons.  But, indeed, if human beings\nwere meant to travel there, they had my pity!  They must travel in the\ndark, for there was no sign of a window; and they would be shaken all the\nway like a phial of doctor’s stuff, for the cart was not only ungainly to\nlook at—it was besides very imperfectly balanced on the one pair of\nwheels, and pitched unconscionably.  Altogether, if I had any glancing\nidea that the cart was really a carriage, I had soon dismissed it; but I\nwas still inquisitive as to what it should contain, and where it had come\nfrom.  Wheels and horses were splashed with many different colours of\nmud, as though they had come far and across a considerable diversity of\ncountry.  The driver continually and vainly plied his whip.  It seemed to\nfollow they had made a long, perhaps an all-night, stage; and that the\ndriver, at that early hour of a little after eight in the morning,\nalready felt himself belated.  I looked for the name of the proprietor on\nthe shaft, and started outright.  Fortune had favoured the careless: it\nwas Burchell Fenn!\n\n‘A wet morning, my man,’ said I.\n\nThe driver, a loutish fellow, shock-headed and turnip-faced, returned not\na word to my salutation, but savagely flogged his horses.  The tired\nanimals, who could scarce put the one foot before the other, paid no\nattention to his cruelty; and I continued without effort to maintain my\nposition alongside, smiling to myself at the futility of his attempts,\nand at the same time pricked with curiosity as to why he made them.  I\nmade no such formidable a figure as that a man should flee when I\naccosted him; and my conscience not being entirely clear, I was more\naccustomed to be uneasy myself than to see others timid.  Presently he\ndesisted, and put back his whip in the holster with the air of a man\nvanquished.\n\n‘So you would run away from me?’ said I.  ‘Come, come, that’s not\nEnglish.’\n\n‘Beg pardon, master: no offence meant,’ he said, touching his hat.\n\n‘And none taken!’ cried I.  ‘All I desire is a little gaiety by the way.’\n\nI understood him to say he didn’t ‘take with gaiety.’\n\n‘Then I will try you with something else,’ said I.  ‘Oh, I can be all\nthings to all men, like the apostle!  I dare to say I have travelled with\nheavier fellows than you in my time, and done famously well with them.\nAre you going home?’\n\n‘Yes, I’m a goin’ home, I am,’ he said.\n\n‘A very fortunate circumstance for me!’ said I.  ‘At this rate we shall\nsee a good deal of each other, going the same way; and, now I come to\nthink of it, why should you not give me a cast?  There is room beside you\non the bench.’\n\nWith a sudden snatch, he carried the cart two yards into the roadway.\nThe horses plunged and came to a stop.  ‘No, you don’t!’ he said,\nmenacing me with the whip.  ‘None o’ that with me.’\n\n‘None of what?’ said I.  ‘I asked you for a lift, but I have no idea of\ntaking one by force.’\n\n‘Well, I’ve got to take care of the cart and ’orses, I have,’ says he.\n‘I don’t take up with no runagate vagabones, you see, else.’\n\n‘I ought to thank you for your touching confidence,’ said I, approaching\ncarelessly nearer as I spoke.  ‘But I admit the road is solitary\nhereabouts, and no doubt an accident soon happens.  Little fear of\nanything of the kind with you!  I like you for it, like your prudence,\nlike that pastoral shyness of disposition.  But why not put it out of my\npower to hurt?  Why not open the door and bestow me here in the box, or\nwhatever you please to call it?’ And I laid my hand demonstratively on\nthe body of the cart.\n\nHe had been timorous before; but at this, he seemed to lose the power of\nspeech a moment, and stared at me in a perfect enthusiasm of fear.\n\n‘Why not?’ I continued.  ‘The idea is good.  I should be safe in there if\nI were the monster Williams himself.  The great thing is to have me under\nlock and key.  For it does lock; it is locked now,’ said I, trying the\ndoor.  ‘_A propos_, what have you for a cargo?  It must be precious.’\n\nHe found not a word to answer.\n\nRat-tat-tat, I went upon the door like a well-drilled footman.\n\n‘Any one at home?’ I said, and stooped to listen.\n\nThere came out of the interior a stifled sneeze, the first of an\nuncontrollable paroxysm; another followed immediately on the heels of it;\nand then the driver turned with an oath, laid the lash upon the horses\nwith so much energy that they found their heels again, and the whole\nequipage fled down the road at a gallop.\n\nAt the first sound of the sneeze, I had started back like a man shot.\nThe next moment, a great light broke on my mind, and I understood.  Here\nwas the secret of Fenn’s trade: this was how he forwarded the escape of\nprisoners, hawking them by night about the country in his covered cart.\nThere had been Frenchmen close to me; he who had just sneezed was my\ncountryman, my comrade, perhaps already my friend!  I took to my heels in\npursuit.  ‘Hold hard!’ I shouted.  ‘Stop!  It’s all right!  Stop!’  But\nthe driver only turned a white face on me for a moment, and redoubled his\nefforts, bending forward, plying his whip and crying to his horses; these\nlay themselves down to the gallop and beat the highway with flying hoofs;\nand the cart bounded after them among the ruts and fled in a halo of rain\nand spattering mud.  But a minute since, and it had been trundling along\nlike a lame cow; and now it was off as though drawn by Apollo’s coursers.\nThere is no telling what a man can do, until you frighten him!\n\nIt was as much as I could do myself, though I ran valiantly, to maintain\nmy distance; and that (since I knew my countrymen so near) was become a\nchief point with me.  A hundred yards farther on the cart whipped out of\nthe high-road into a lane embowered with leafless trees, and became lost\nto view.  When I saw it next, the driver had increased his advantage\nconsiderably, but all danger was at an end, and the horses had again\ndeclined into a hobbling walk.  Persuaded that they could not escape me,\nI took my time, and recovered my breath as I followed them.\n\nPresently the lane twisted at right angles, and showed me a gate and the\nbeginning of a gravel sweep; and a little after, as I continued to\nadvance, a red brick house about seventy years old, in a fine style of\narchitecture, and presenting a front of many windows to a lawn and\ngarden.  Behind, I could see outhouses and the peaked roofs of stacks;\nand I judged that a manor-house had in some way declined to be the\nresidence of a tenant-farmer, careless alike of appearances and\nsubstantial comfort.  The marks of neglect were visible on every side, in\nflower-bushes straggling beyond the borders, in the ill-kept turf, and in\nthe broken windows that were incongruously patched with paper or stuffed\nwith rags.  A thicket of trees, mostly evergreen, fenced the place round\nand secluded it from the eyes of prying neighbours.  As I came in view of\nit, on that melancholy winter’s morning, in the deluge of the falling\nrain, and with the wind that now rose in occasional gusts and hooted over\nthe old chimneys, the cart had already drawn up at the front-door steps,\nand the driver was already in earnest discourse with Mr. Burchell Fenn.\nHe was standing with his hands behind his back—a man of a gross,\nmisbegotten face and body, dewlapped like a bull and red as a harvest\nmoon; and in his jockey cap, blue coat and top boots, he had much the air\nof a good, solid tenant-farmer.\n\nThe pair continued to speak as I came up the approach, but received me at\nlast in a sort of goggling silence.  I had my hat in my hand.\n\n‘I have the pleasure of addressing Mr. Burchell Fenn?’ said I.\n\n‘The same, sir,’ replied Mr. Fenn, taking off his jockey cap in answer to\nmy civility, but with the distant look and the tardy movements of one who\ncontinues to think of something else.  ‘And who may you be?’ he asked.\n\n‘I shall tell you afterwards,’ said I.  ‘Suffice it, in the meantime,\nthat I come on business.’\n\nHe seemed to digest my answer laboriously, his mouth gaping, his little\neyes never straying from my face.\n\n‘Suffer me to point out to you, sir,’ I resumed, ‘that this is a devil of\na wet morning; and that the chimney corner, and possibly a glass of\nsomething hot, are clearly indicated.’\n\nIndeed, the rain was now grown to be a deluge; the gutters of the house\nroared; the air was filled with the continuous, strident crash.  The\nstolidity of his face, on which the rain streamed, was far from\nreassuring me.  On the contrary, I was aware of a distinct qualm of\napprehension, which was not at all lessened by a view of the driver,\ncraning from his perch to observe us with the expression of a fascinated\nbird.  So we stood silent, when the prisoner again began to sneeze from\nthe body of the cart; and at the sound, prompt as a transformation, the\ndriver had whipped up his horses and was shambling off round the corner\nof the house, and Mr. Fenn, recovering his wits with a gulp, had turned\nto the door behind him.\n\n‘Come in, come in, sir,’ he said.  ‘I beg your pardon, sir; the lock goes\na trifle hard.’\n\nIndeed, it took him a surprising time to open the door, which was not\nonly locked on the outside, but the lock seemed rebellious from disuse;\nand when at last he stood back and motioned me to enter before him, I was\ngreeted on the threshold by that peculiar and convincing sound of the\nrain echoing over empty chambers.  The entrance-hall, in which I now\nfound myself, was of a good size and good proportions; potted plants\noccupied the corners; the paved floor was soiled with muddy footprints\nand encumbered with straw; on a mahogany hall-table, which was the only\nfurniture, a candle had been stuck and suffered to burn down—plainly a\nlong while ago, for the gutterings were green with mould.  My mind, under\nthese new impressions, worked with unusual vivacity.  I was here shut off\nwith Fenn and his hireling in a deserted house, a neglected garden, and a\nwood of evergreens: the most eligible theatre for a deed of darkness.\nThere came to me a vision of two flagstones raised in the hall-floor, and\nthe driver putting in the rainy afternoon over my grave, and the prospect\ndispleased me extremely.  I felt I had carried my pleasantry as far as\nwas safe; I must lose no time in declaring my true character, and I was\neven choosing the words in which I was to begin, when the hall-door was\nslammed-to behind me with a bang, and I turned, dropping my stick as I\ndid so, in time—and not any more than time—to save my life.\n\nThe surprise of the onslaught and the huge weight of my assailant gave\nhim the advantage.  He had a pistol in his right hand of a portentous\nsize, which it took me all my strength to keep deflected.  With his left\narm he strained me to his bosom, so that I thought I must be crushed or\nstifled.  His mouth was open, his face crimson, and he panted aloud with\nhard animal sounds.  The affair was as brief as it was hot and sudden.\nThe potations which had swelled and bloated his carcase had already\nweakened the springs of energy.  One more huge effort, that came near to\noverpower me, and in which the pistol happily exploded, and I felt his\ngrasp slacken and weakness come on his joints; his legs succumbed under\nhis weight, and he grovelled on his knees on the stone floor.  ‘Spare\nme!’ he gasped.\n\nI had not only been abominably frightened; I was shocked besides: my\ndelicacy was in arms, like a lady to whom violence should have been\noffered by a similar monster.  I plucked myself from his horrid contact,\nI snatched the pistol—even discharged, it was a formidable weapon—and\nmenaced him with the butt.  ‘Spare you!’ I cried, ‘you beast!’\n\nHis voice died in his fat inwards, but his lips still vehemently framed\nthe same words of supplication.  My anger began to pass off, but not all\nmy repugnance; the picture he made revolted me, and I was impatient to be\nspared the further view of it.\n\n‘Here,’ said I, ‘stop this performance: it sickens me.  I am not going to\nkill you, do you hear?  I have need of you.’\n\nA look of relief, that I could almost have called beautiful, dawned on\nhis countenance.  ‘Anything—anything you wish,’ said he.\n\nAnything is a big word, and his use of it brought me for a moment to a\nstand.  ‘Why, what do you mean?’ I asked.  ‘Do you mean that you will\nblow the gaff on the whole business?’\n\nHe answered me Yes with eager asseverations.\n\n‘I know Monsieur de Saint-Yves is in it; it was through his papers we\ntraced you,’ I said.  ‘Do you consent to make a clean breast of the\nothers?’\n\n‘I do—I will!’ he cried.  ‘The ’ole crew of ’em; there’s good names among\n’em.  I’ll be king’s evidence.’\n\n‘So that all shall hang except yourself?  You damned villain!’ I broke\nout.  ‘Understand at once that I am no spy or thief-taker.  I am a\nkinsman of Monsieur de St. Yves—here in his interest.  Upon my word, you\nhave put your foot in it prettily, Mr. Burchell Fenn!  Come, stand up;\ndon’t grovel there.  Stand up, you lump of iniquity!’\n\nHe scrambled to his feet.  He was utterly unmanned, or it might have gone\nhard with me yet; and I considered him hesitating, as, indeed, there was\ncause.  The man was a double-dyed traitor: he had tried to murder me, and\nI had first baffled his endeavours and then exposed and insulted him.\nWas it wise to place myself any longer at his mercy?  With his help I\nshould doubtless travel more quickly; doubtless also far less agreeably;\nand there was everything to show that it would be at a greater risk.  In\nshort, I should have washed my hands of him on the spot, but for the\ntemptation of the French officers, whom I knew to be so near, and for\nwhose society I felt so great and natural an impatience.  If I was to see\nanything of my countrymen, it was clear I had first of all to make my\npeace with Mr. Fenn; and that was no easy matter.  To make friends with\nany one implies concessions on both sides; and what could I concede?\nWhat could I say of him, but that he had proved himself a villain and a\nfool, and the worse man?\n\n‘Well,’ said I, ‘here has been rather a poor piece of business, which I\ndare say you can have no pleasure in calling to mind; and, to say truth,\nI would as readily forget it myself.  Suppose we try.  Take back your\npistol, which smells very ill; put it in your pocket or wherever you had\nit concealed.  There!  Now let us meet for the first time.—Give you good\nmorning, Mr. Fenn!  I hope you do very well.  I come on the\nrecommendation of my kinsman, the Vicomte de St. Yves.’\n\n‘Do you mean it?’ he cried.  ‘Do you mean you will pass over our little\nscrimmage?’\n\n‘Why, certainly!’ said I.  ‘It shows you are a bold fellow, who may be\ntrusted to forget the business when it comes to the point.  There is\nnothing against you in the little scrimmage, unless that your courage is\ngreater than your strength.  You are not so young as you once were, that\nis all.’\n\n‘And I beg of you, sir, don’t betray me to the Vis-count,’ he pleaded.\n‘I’ll not deny but what my ’eart failed me a trifle; but it was only a\nword, sir, what anybody might have said in the ’eat of the moment, and\nover with it.’\n\n‘Certainly,’ said I.  ‘That is quite my own opinion.’\n\n‘The way I came to be anxious about the Vis-count,’ he continued, ‘is\nthat I believe he might be induced to form an ’asty judgment.  And the\nbusiness, in a pecuniary point of view, is all that I could ask; only\ntrying, sir—very trying.  It’s making an old man of me before my time.\nYou might have observed yourself, sir, that I ’aven’t got the knees I\nonce ’ad.  The knees and the breathing, there’s where it takes me.  But\nI’m very sure, sir, I address a gentleman as would be the last to make\ntrouble between friends.’\n\n‘I am sure you do me no more than justice,’ said I; ‘and I shall think it\nquite unnecessary to dwell on any of these passing circumstances in my\nreport to the Vicomte.’\n\n‘Which you do favour him (if you’ll excuse me being so bold as to mention\nit) exac’ly!’ said he.  ‘I should have known you anywheres.  May I offer\nyou a pot of ’ome-brewed ale, sir?  By your leave!  This way, if you\nplease.  I am ’eartily grateful—’eartily pleased to be of any service to\na gentleman like you, sir, which is related to the Vis-count, and really\na fambly of which you might well be proud!  Take care of the step, sir.\nYou have good news of ’is ’ealth, I trust? as well as that of Monseer the\nCount?’\n\nGod forgive me! the horrible fellow was still puffing and panting with\nthe fury of his assault, and already he had fallen into an obsequious,\nwheedling familiarity like that of an old servant,—already he was\nflattering me on my family connections!\n\nI followed him through the house into the stable-yard, where I observed\nthe driver washing the cart in a shed.  He must have heard the explosion\nof the pistol.  He could not choose but hear it: the thing was shaped\nlike a little blunderbuss, charged to the mouth, and made a report like a\npiece of field artillery.  He had heard, he had paid no attention; and\nnow, as we came forth by the back-door, he raised for a moment a pale and\ntell-tale face that was as direct as a confession.  The rascal had\nexpected to see Fenn come forth alone; he was waiting to be called on for\nthat part of sexton, which I had already allotted to him in fancy.\n\nI need not detain the reader very long with any description of my visit\nto the back-kitchen; of how we mulled our ale there, and mulled it very\nwell; nor of how we sat talking, Fenn like an old, faithful, affectionate\ndependant, and I—well!  I myself fallen into a mere admiration of so much\nimpudence, that transcended words, and had very soon conquered animosity.\nI took a fancy to the man, he was so vast a humbug.  I began to see a\nkind of beauty in him, his _aplomb_ was so majestic.  I never knew a\nrogue to cut so fat; his villainy was ample, like his belly, and I could\nscarce find it in my heart to hold him responsible for either.  He was\ngood enough to drop into the autobiographical; telling me how the farm,\nin spite of the war and the high prices, had proved a disappointment; how\nthere was ‘a sight of cold, wet land as you come along the ’igh-road’;\nhow the winds and rains and the seasons had been misdirected, it seemed\n‘o’ purpose’; how Mrs. Fenn had died—‘I lost her coming two year agone; a\nremarkable fine woman, my old girl, sir! if you’ll excuse me,’ he added,\nwith a burst of humility.  In short, he gave me an opportunity of\nstudying John Bull, as I may say, stuffed naked—his greed, his\nusuriousness, his hypocrisy, his perfidy of the back-stairs, all swelled\nto the superlative—such as was well worth the little disarray and fluster\nof our passage in the hall.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII—I MEET TWO OF MY COUNTRYMEN\n\n\nAs soon as I judged it safe, and that was not before Burchell Fenn had\ntalked himself back into his breath and a complete good humour, I\nproposed he should introduce me to the French officers, henceforth to\nbecome my fellow-passengers.  There were two of them, it appeared, and my\nheart beat as I approached the door.  The specimen of Perfidious Albion\nwhom I had just been studying gave me the stronger zest for my\nfellow-countrymen.  I could have embraced them; I could have wept on\ntheir necks.  And all the time I was going to a disappointment.\n\nIt was in a spacious and low room, with an outlook on the court, that I\nfound them bestowed.  In the good days of that house the apartment had\nprobably served as a library, for there were traces of shelves along the\nwainscot.  Four or five mattresses lay on the floor in a corner, with a\nfrowsy heap of bedding; near by was a basin and a cube of soap; a rude\nkitchen-table and some deal chairs stood together at the far end; and the\nroom was illuminated by no less than four windows, and warmed by a\nlittle, crazy, sidelong grate, propped up with bricks in the vent of a\nhospitable chimney, in which a pile of coals smoked prodigiously and gave\nout a few starveling flames.  An old, frail, white-haired officer sat in\none of the chairs, which he had drawn close to this apology for a fire.\nHe was wrapped in a camlet cloak, of which the collar was turned up, his\nknees touched the bars, his hands were spread in the very smoke, and yet\nhe shivered for cold.  The second—a big, florid, fine animal of a man,\nwhose every gesture labelled him the cock of the walk and the admiration\nof the ladies—had apparently despaired of the fire, and now strode up and\ndown, sneezing hard, bitterly blowing his nose, and proffering a\ncontinual stream of bluster, complaint, and barrack-room oaths.\n\nFenn showed me in with the brief form of introduction: ‘Gentlemen all,\nthis here’s another fare!’ and was gone again at once.  The old man gave\nme but the one glance out of lack-lustre eyes; and even as he looked a\nshiver took him as sharp as a hiccough.  But the other, who represented\nto admiration the picture of a Beau in a Catarrh, stared at me\narrogantly.\n\n‘And who are you, sir?’ he asked.\n\nI made the military salute to my superiors.\n\n‘Champdivers, private, Eighth of the Line,’ said I.\n\n‘Pretty business!’ said he.  ‘And you are going on with us?  Three in a\ncart, and a great trolloping private at that!  And who is to pay for you,\nmy fine fellow?’ he inquired.\n\n‘If monsieur comes to that,’ I answered civilly, ‘who paid for him?’\n\n‘Oh, if you choose to play the wit!’ said he,—and began to rail at large\nupon his destiny, the weather, the cold, the danger and the expense of\nthe escape, and, above all, the cooking of the accursed English.  It\nseemed to annoy him particularly that I should have joined their party.\n‘If you knew what you were doing, thirty thousand millions of pigs! you\nwould keep yourself to yourself!  The horses can’t drag the cart; the\nroads are all ruts and swamps.  No longer ago than last night the Colonel\nand I had to march half the way—thunder of God!—half the way to the knees\nin mud—and I with this infernal cold—and the danger of detection!\nHappily we met no one: a desert—a real desert—like the whole abominable\ncountry!  Nothing to eat—no, sir, there is nothing to eat but raw cow and\ngreens boiled in water—nor to drink but Worcestershire sauce!  Now I,\nwith my catarrh, I have no appetite; is it not so?  Well, if I were in\nFrance, I should have a good soup with a crust in it, an omelette, a fowl\nin rice, a partridge in cabbages—things to tempt me, thunder of God!  But\nhere—day of God!—what a country!  And cold, too!  They talk about\nRussia—this is all the cold I want!  And the people—look at them!  What a\nrace!  Never any handsome men; never any fine officers!’—and he looked\ndown complacently for a moment at his waist—‘And the women—what faggots!\nNo, that is one point clear, I cannot stomach the English!’\n\nThere was something in this man so antipathetic to me, as sent the\nmustard into my nose.  I can never bear your bucks and dandies, even when\nthey are decent-looking and well dressed; and the Major—for that was his\nrank—was the image of a flunkey in good luck.  Even to be in agreement\nwith him, or to seem to be so, was more than I could make out to endure.\n\n‘You could scarce be expected to stomach them,’ said I civilly, ‘after\nhaving just digested your parole.’\n\nHe whipped round on his heel and turned on me a countenance which I dare\nsay he imagined to be awful; but another fit of sneezing cut him off ere\nhe could come the length of speech.\n\n‘I have not tried the dish myself,’ I took the opportunity to add.  ‘It\nis said to be unpalatable.  Did monsieur find it so?’\n\nWith surprising vivacity the Colonel woke from his lethargy.  He was\nbetween us ere another word could pass.\n\n‘Shame, gentlemen!’ he said.  ‘Is this a time for Frenchmen and\nfellow-soldiers to fall out?  We are in the midst of our enemies; a\nquarrel, a loud word, may suffice to plunge us back into irretrievable\ndistress.  _Monsieur le Commandant_, you have been gravely offended.  I\nmake it my request, I make it my prayer—if need be, I give you my\norders—that the matter shall stand by until we come safe to France.\nThen, if you please, I will serve you in any capacity.  And for you,\nyoung man, you have shown all the cruelty and carelessness of youth.\nThis gentleman is your superior; he is no longer young’—at which word you\nare to conceive the Major’s face.  ‘It is admitted he has broken his\nparole.  I know not his reason, and no more do you.  It might be\npatriotism in this hour of our country’s adversity, it might be humanity,\nnecessity; you know not what in the least, and you permit yourself to\nreflect on his honour.  To break parole may be a subject for pity and not\nderision.  I have broken mine—I, a colonel of the Empire.  And why?  I\nhave been years negotiating my exchange, and it cannot be managed; those\nwho have influence at the Ministry of War continually rush in before me,\nand I have to wait, and my daughter at home is in a decline.  I am going\nto see my daughter at last, and it is my only concern lest I should have\ndelayed too long.  She is ill, and very ill,—at death’s door.  Nothing is\nleft me but my daughter, my Emperor, and my honour; and I give my honour,\nblame me for it who dare!’\n\nAt this my heart smote me.\n\n‘For God’s sake,’ I cried, ‘think no more of what I have said!  A parole?\nwhat is a parole against life and death and love?  I ask your pardon;\nthis gentleman’s also.  As long as I shall be with you, you shall not\nhave cause to complain of me again.  I pray God you will find your\ndaughter alive and restored.’\n\n‘That is past praying for,’ said the Colonel; and immediately the brief\nfire died out of him, and, returning to the hearth, he relapsed into his\nformer abstraction.\n\nBut I was not so easy to compose.  The knowledge of the poor gentleman’s\ntrouble, and the sight of his face, had filled me with the bitterness of\nremorse; and I insisted upon shaking hands with the Major (which he did\nwith a very ill grace), and abounded in palinodes and apologies.\n\n‘After all,’ said I, ‘who am I to talk?  I am in the luck to be a private\nsoldier; I have no parole to give or to keep; once I am over the rampart,\nI am as free as air.  I beg you to believe that I regret from my soul the\nuse of these ungenerous expressions.  Allow me . . . Is there no way in\nthis damned house to attract attention?  Where is this fellow, Fenn?’\n\nI ran to one of the windows and threw it open.  Fenn, who was at the\nmoment passing below in the court, cast up his arms like one in despair,\ncalled to me to keep back, plunged into the house, and appeared next\nmoment in the doorway of the chamber.\n\n‘Oh, sir!’ says he, ‘keep away from those there windows.  A body might\nsee you from the back lane.’\n\n‘It is registered,’ said I.  ‘Henceforward I will be a mouse for\nprecaution and a ghost for invisibility.  But in the meantime, for God’s\nsake, fetch us a bottle of brandy!  Your room is as damp as the bottom of\na well, and these gentlemen are perishing of cold.’\n\nSo soon as I had paid him (for everything, I found, must be paid in\nadvance), I turned my attention to the fire, and whether because I threw\ngreater energy into the business, or because the coals were now warmed\nand the time ripe, I soon started a blaze that made the chimney roar\nagain.  The shine of it, in that dark, rainy day, seemed to reanimate the\nColonel like a blink of sun.  With the outburst of the flames, besides, a\ndraught was established, which immediately delivered us from the plague\nof smoke; and by the time Fenn returned, carrying a bottle under his arm\nand a single tumbler in his hand, there was already an air of gaiety in\nthe room that did the heart good.\n\nI poured out some of the brandy.\n\n‘Colonel,’ said I, ‘I am a young man and a private soldier.  I have not\nbeen long in this room, and already I have shown the petulance that\nbelongs to the one character and the ill manners that you may look for in\nthe other.  Have the humanity to pass these slips over, and honour me so\nfar as to accept this glass.’\n\n‘My lad,’ says he, waking up and blinking at me with an air of suspicion,\n‘are you sure you can afford it?’\n\nI assured him I could.\n\n‘I thank you, then: I am very cold.’  He took the glass out, and a little\ncolour came in his face.  ‘I thank you again,’ said he.  ‘It goes to the\nheart.’\n\nThe Major, when I motioned him to help himself, did so with a good deal\nof liberality; continued to do so for the rest of the morning, now with\nsome sort of apology, now with none at all; and the bottle began to look\nfoolish before dinner was served.  It was such a meal as he had himself\npredicted: beef, greens, potatoes, mustard in a teacup, and beer in a\nbrown jug that was all over hounds, horses, and hunters, with a fox at\nthe fat end and a gigantic John Bull—for all the world like Fenn—sitting\nin the midst in a bob-wig and smoking tobacco.  The beer was a good brew,\nbut not good enough for the Major; he laced it with brandy—for his cold,\nhe said; and in this curative design the remainder of the bottle ebbed\naway.  He called my attention repeatedly to the circumstance; helped me\npointedly to the dregs, threw the bottle in the air and played tricks\nwith it; and at last, having exhausted his ingenuity, and seeing me\nremain quite blind to every hint, he ordered and paid for another\nhimself.\n\nAs for the Colonel, he ate nothing, sat sunk in a muse, and only awoke\noccasionally to a sense of where he was, and what he was supposed to be\ndoing.  On each of these occasions he showed a gratitude and kind\ncourtesy that endeared him to me beyond expression.  ‘Champdivers, my\nlad, your health!’ he would say.  ‘The Major and I had a very arduous\nmarch last night, and I positively thought I should have eaten nothing,\nbut your fortunate idea of the brandy has made quite a new man of\nme—quite a new man.’  And he would fall to with a great air of\nheartiness, cut himself a mouthful, and, before he had swallowed it,\nwould have forgotten his dinner, his company, the place where he then\nwas, and the escape he was engaged on, and become absorbed in the vision\nof a sick-room and a dying girl in France.  The pathos of this continual\npreoccupation, in a man so old, sick, and over-weary, and whom I looked\nupon as a mere bundle of dying bones and death-pains, put me wholly from\nmy victuals: it seemed there was an element of sin, a kind of rude\nbravado of youth, in the mere relishing of food at the same table with\nthis tragic father; and though I was well enough used to the coarse,\nplain diet of the English, I ate scarce more than himself.  Dinner was\nhardly over before he succumbed to a lethargic sleep; lying on one of the\nmattresses with his limbs relaxed, and his breath seemingly suspended—the\nvery image of dissolution.\n\nThis left the Major and myself alone at the table.  You must not suppose\nour _tête-à-tête_ was long, but it was a lively period while it lasted.\nHe drank like a fish or an Englishman; shouted, beat the table, roared\nout songs, quarrelled, made it up again, and at last tried to throw the\ndinner-plates through the window, a feat of which he was at that time\nquite incapable.  For a party of fugitives, condemned to the most\nrigorous discretion, there was never seen so noisy a carnival; and\nthrough it all the Colonel continued to sleep like a child.  Seeing the\nMajor so well advanced, and no retreat possible, I made a fair wind of a\nfoul one, keeping his glass full, pushing him with toasts; and sooner\nthan I could have dared to hope, he became drowsy and incoherent.  With\nthe wrong-headedness of all such sots, he would not be persuaded to lie\ndown upon one of the mattresses until I had stretched myself upon\nanother.  But the comedy was soon over; soon he slept the sleep of the\njust, and snored like a military music; and I might get up again and face\n(as best I could) the excessive tedium of the afternoon.\n\nI had passed the night before in a good bed; I was denied the resource of\nslumber; and there was nothing open for me but to pace the apartment,\nmaintain the fire, and brood on my position.  I compared yesterday and\nto-day—the safety, comfort, jollity, open-air exercise and pleasant\nroadside inns of the one, with the tedium, anxiety, and discomfort of the\nother.  I remembered that I was in the hands of Fenn, who could not be\nmore false—though he might be more vindictive—than I fancied him.  I\nlooked forward to nights of pitching in the covered cart, and days of\nmonotony in I knew not what hiding-places; and my heart failed me, and I\nwas in two minds whether to slink off ere it was too late, and return to\nmy former solitary way of travel.  But the Colonel stood in the path.  I\nhad not seen much of him; but already I judged him a man of a childlike\nnature—with that sort of innocence and courtesy that, I think, is only to\nbe found in old soldiers or old priests—and broken with years and sorrow.\nI could not turn my back on his distress; could not leave him alone with\nthe selfish trooper who snored on the next mattress.  ‘Champdivers, my\nlad, your health!’ said a voice in my ear, and stopped me—and there are\nfew things I am more glad of in the retrospect than that it did.\n\nIt must have been about four in the afternoon—at least the rain had taken\noff, and the sun was setting with some wintry pomp—when the current of my\nreflections was effectually changed by the arrival of two visitors in a\ngig.  They were farmers of the neighbourhood, I suppose—big, burly\nfellows in great-coats and top-boots, mightily flushed with liquor when\nthey arrived, and, before they left, inimitably drunk.  They stayed long\nin the kitchen with Burchell, drinking, shouting, singing, and keeping it\nup; and the sound of their merry minstrelsy kept me a kind of company.\nThe night fell, and the shine of the fire brightened and blinked on the\npanelled wall.  Our illuminated windows must have been visible not only\nfrom the back lane of which Fenn had spoken, but from the court where the\nfarmers’ gig awaited them.  In the far end of the firelit room lay my\ncompanions, the one silent, the other clamorously noisy, the images of\ndeath and drunkenness.  Little wonder if I were tempted to join in the\nchoruses below, and sometimes could hardly refrain from laughter, and\nsometimes, I believe, from tears—so unmitigated was the tedium, so cruel\nthe suspense, of this period.\n\nAt last, about six at night, I should fancy, the noisy minstrels appeared\nin the court, headed by Fenn with a lantern, and knocking together as\nthey came.  The visitors clambered noisily into the gig, one of them\nshook the reins, and they were snatched out of sight and hearing with a\nsuddenness that partook of the nature of prodigy.  I am well aware there\nis a Providence for drunken men, that holds the reins for them and\npresides over their troubles; doubtless he had his work cut out for him\nwith this particular gigful!  Fenn rescued his toes with an ejaculation\nfrom under the departing wheels, and turned at once with uncertain steps\nand devious lantern to the far end of the court.  There, through the open\ndoors of a coach-house, the shock-headed lad was already to be seen\ndrawing forth the covered cart.  If I wished any private talk with our\nhost, it must be now or never.\n\nAccordingly I groped my way downstairs, and came to him as he looked on\nat and lighted the harnessing of the horses.\n\n‘The hour approaches when we have to part,’ said I; ‘and I shall be\nobliged if you will tell your servant to drop me at the nearest point for\nDunstable.  I am determined to go so far with our friends, Colonel X and\nMajor Y, but my business is peremptory, and it takes me to the\nneighbourhood of Dunstable.’\n\nOrders were given to my satisfaction, with an obsequiousness that seemed\nonly inflamed by his potations.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV—TRAVELS OF THE COVERED CART\n\n\nMy companions were aroused with difficulty: the Colonel, poor old\ngentleman, to a sort of permanent dream, in which you could say of him\nonly that he was very deaf and anxiously polite; the Major still maudlin\ndrunk.  We had a dish of tea by the fireside, and then issued like\ncriminals into the scathing cold of the night.  For the weather had in\nthe meantime changed.  Upon the cessation of the rain, a strict frost had\nsucceeded.  The moon, being young, was already near the zenith when we\nstarted, glittered everywhere on sheets of ice, and sparkled in ten\nthousand icicles.  A more unpromising night for a journey it was hard to\nconceive.  But in the course of the afternoon the horses had been well\nroughed; and King (for such was the name of the shock-headed lad) was\nvery positive that he could drive us without misadventure.  He was as\ngood as his word; indeed, despite a gawky air, he was simply invaluable\nin his present employment, showing marked sagacity in all that concerned\nthe care of horses, and guiding us by one short cut after another for\ndays, and without a fault.\n\nThe interior of that engine of torture, the covered cart, was fitted with\na bench, on which we took our places; the door was shut; in a moment, the\nnight closed upon us solid and stifling; and we felt that we were being\ndriven carefully out of the courtyard.  Careful was the word all night,\nand it was an alleviation of our miseries that we did not often enjoy.\nIn general, as we were driven the better part of the night and day, often\nat a pretty quick pace and always through a labyrinth of the most\ninfamous country lanes and by-roads, we were so bruised upon the bench,\nso dashed against the top and sides of the cart, that we reached the end\nof a stage in truly pitiable case, sometimes flung ourselves down without\nthe formality of eating, made but one sleep of it until the hour of\ndeparture returned, and were only properly awakened by the first jolt of\nthe renewed journey.  There were interruptions, at times, that we hailed\nas alleviations.  At times the cart was bogged, once it was upset, and we\nmust alight and lend the driver the assistance of our arms; at times, too\n(as on the occasion when I had first encountered it), the horses gave\nout, and we had to trail alongside in mud or frost until the first peep\nof daylight, or the approach to a hamlet or a high road, bade us\ndisappear like ghosts into our prison.\n\nThe main roads of England are incomparable for excellence, of a beautiful\nsmoothness, very ingeniously laid down, and so well kept that in most\nweathers you could take your dinner off any part of them without\ndistaste.  On them, to the note of the bugle, the mail did its sixty\nmiles a day; innumerable chaises whisked after the bobbing postboys; or\nsome young blood would flit by in a curricle and tandem, to the vast\ndelight and danger of the lieges.  On them, the slow-pacing waggons made\na music of bells, and all day long the travellers on horse-back and the\ntravellers on foot (like happy Mr. St. Ives so little a while before!)\nkept coming and going, and baiting and gaping at each other, as though a\nfair were due, and they were gathering to it from all England.  No,\nnowhere in the world is travel so great a pleasure as in that country.\nBut unhappily our one need was to be secret; and all this rapid and\nanimated picture of the road swept quite apart from us, as we lumbered up\nhill and down dale, under hedge and over stone, among circuitous byways.\nOnly twice did I receive, as it were, a whiff of the highway.  The first\nreached my ears alone.  I might have been anywhere.  I only knew I was\nwalking in the dark night and among ruts, when I heard very far off, over\nthe silent country that surrounded us, the guard’s horn wailing its\nsignal to the next post-house for a change of horses.  It was like the\nvoice of the day heard in darkness, a voice of the world heard in prison,\nthe note of a cock crowing in the mid-seas—in short, I cannot tell you\nwhat it was like, you will have to fancy for yourself—but I could have\nwept to hear it.  Once we were belated: the cattle could hardly crawl,\nthe day was at hand, it was a nipping, rigorous morning, King was lashing\nhis horses, I was giving an arm to the old Colonel, and the Major was\ncoughing in our rear.  I must suppose that King was a thought careless,\nbeing nearly in desperation about his team, and, in spite of the cold\nmorning, breathing hot with his exertions.  We came, at last, a little\nbefore sunrise to the summit of a hill, and saw the high-road passing at\nright angles through an open country of meadows and hedgerow pollards;\nand not only the York mail, speeding smoothly at the gallop of the four\nhorses, but a post-chaise besides, with the post-boy titupping briskly,\nand the traveller himself putting his head out of the window, but whether\nto breathe the dawn, or the better to observe the passage of the mail, I\ndo not know.  So that we enjoyed for an instant a picture of free life on\nthe road, in its most luxurious forms of despatch and comfort.  And\nthereafter, with a poignant feeling of contrast in our hearts, we must\nmount again into our wheeled dungeon.\n\nWe came to our stages at all sorts of odd hours, and they were in all\nkinds of odd places.  I may say at once that my first experience was my\nbest.  Nowhere again were we so well entertained as at Burchell Fenn’s.\nAnd this, I suppose, was natural, and indeed inevitable, in so long and\nsecret a journey.  The first stop, we lay six hours in a barn standing by\nitself in a poor, marshy orchard, and packed with hay; to make it more\nattractive, we were told it had been the scene of an abominable murder,\nand was now haunted.  But the day was beginning to break, and our fatigue\nwas too extreme for visionary terrors.  The second or third, we alighted\non a barren heath about midnight, built a fire to warm us under the\nshelter of some thorns, supped like beggars on bread and a piece of cold\nbacon, and slept like gipsies with our feet to the fire.  In the\nmeanwhile, King was gone with the cart, I know not where, to get a change\nof horses, and it was late in the dark morning when he returned and we\nwere able to resume our journey.  In the middle of another night, we came\nto a stop by an ancient, whitewashed cottage of two stories; a privet\nhedge surrounded it; the frosty moon shone blankly on the upper windows;\nbut through those of the kitchen the firelight was seen glinting on the\nroof and reflected from the dishes on the wall.  Here, after much\nhammering on the door, King managed to arouse an old crone from the\nchimney-corner chair, where she had been dozing in the watch; and we were\nhad in, and entertained with a dish of hot tea.  This old lady was an\naunt of Burchell Fenn’s—and an unwilling partner in his dangerous trade.\nThough the house stood solitary, and the hour was an unlikely one for any\npassenger upon the road, King and she conversed in whispers only.  There\nwas something dismal, something of the sick-room, in this perpetual,\nguarded sibilation.  The apprehensions of our hostess insensibly\ncommunicated themselves to every one present.  We ate like mice in a\ncat’s ear; if one of us jingled a teaspoon, all would start; and when the\nhour came to take the road again, we drew a long breath of relief, and\nclimbed to our places in the covered cart with a positive sense of\nescape.  The most of our meals, however, were taken boldly at hedgerow\nalehouses, usually at untimely hours of the day, when the clients were in\nthe field or the farmyard at labour.  I shall have to tell presently of\nour last experience of the sort, and how unfortunately it miscarried; but\nas that was the signal for my separation from my fellow-travellers, I\nmust first finish with them.\n\nI had never any occasion to waver in my first judgment of the Colonel.\nThe old gentleman seemed to me, and still seems in the retrospect, the\nsalt of the earth.  I had occasion to see him in the extremes of\nhardship, hunger and cold; he was dying, and he looked it; and yet I\ncannot remember any hasty, harsh, or impatient word to have fallen from\nhis lips.  On the contrary, he ever showed himself careful to please; and\neven if he rambled in his talk, rambled always gently—like a humane,\nhalf-witted old hero, true to his colours to the last.  I would not dare\nto say how often he awoke suddenly from a lethargy, and told us again, as\nthough we had never heard it, the story of how he had earned the cross,\nhow it had been given him by the hand of the Emperor, and of the\ninnocent—and, indeed, foolish—sayings of his daughter when he returned\nwith it on his bosom.  He had another anecdote which he was very apt to\ngive, by way of a rebuke, when the Major wearied us beyond endurance with\ndispraises of the English.  This was an account of the _braves gens_ with\nwhom he had been boarding.  True enough, he was a man so simple and\ngrateful by nature, that the most common civilities were able to touch\nhim to the heart, and would remain written in his memory; but from a\nthousand inconsiderable but conclusive indications, I gathered that this\nfamily had really loved him, and loaded him with kindness.  They made a\nfire in his bedroom, which the sons and daughters tended with their own\nhands; letters from France were looked for with scarce more eagerness by\nhimself than by these alien sympathisers; when they came, he would read\nthem aloud in the parlour to the assembled family, translating as he\nwent.  The Colonel’s English was elementary; his daughter not in the\nleast likely to be an amusing correspondent; and, as I conceived these\nscenes in the parlour, I felt sure the interest centred in the Colonel\nhimself, and I thought I could feel in my own heart that mixture of the\nridiculous and the pathetic, the contest of tears and laughter, which\nmust have shaken the bosoms of the family.  Their kindness had continued\ntill the end.  It appears they were privy to his flight, the camlet cloak\nhad been lined expressly for him, and he was the bearer of a letter from\nthe daughter of the house to his own daughter in Paris.  The last\nevening, when the time came to say good-night, it was tacitly known to\nall that they were to look upon his face no more.  He rose, pleading\nfatigue, and turned to the daughter, who had been his chief ally: ‘You\nwill permit me, my dear—to an old and very unhappy soldier—and may God\nbless you for your goodness!’  The girl threw her arms about his neck and\nsobbed upon his bosom; the lady of the house burst into tears; ‘_et je\nvous le jure_, _le père se mouchait_!’ quoth the Colonel, twisting his\nmoustaches with a cavalry air, and at the same time blinking the water\nfrom his eyes at the mere recollection.\n\nIt was a good thought to me that he had found these friends in captivity;\nthat he had started on this fatal journey from so cordial a farewell.  He\nhad broken his parole for his daughter: that he should ever live to reach\nher sick-bed, that he could continue to endure to an end the hardships,\nthe crushing fatigue, the savage cold, of our pilgrimage, I had early\nceased to hope.  I did for him what I was able,—nursed him, kept him\ncovered, watched over his slumbers, sometimes held him in my arms at the\nrough places of the road.  ‘Champdivers,’ he once said, ‘you are like a\nson to me—like a son.’  It is good to remember, though at the time it put\nme on the rack.  All was to no purpose.  Fast as we were travelling\ntowards France, he was travelling faster still to another destination.\nDaily he grew weaker and more indifferent.  An old rustic accent of Lower\nNormandy reappeared in his speech, from which it had long been banished,\nand grew stronger; old words of the _patois_, too: _Ouistreham_,\n_matrassé_, and others, the sense of which we were sometimes unable to\nguess.  On the very last day he began again his eternal story of the\ncross and the Emperor.  The Major, who was particularly ill, or at least\nparticularly cross, uttered some angry words of protest.\n‘_Pardonnez-moi_, _monsieur le commandant_, _mais c’est pour monsieur_,’\nsaid the Colonel: ‘Monsieur has not yet heard the circumstance, and is\ngood enough to feel an interest.’  Presently after, however, he began to\nlose the thread of his narrative; and at last: ‘_Qué que j’ai_?  _Je\nm’embrouille_!’ says he, ‘_Suffit_: _s’m’a la donné_, _et Berthe en était\nbien contente_.’  It struck me as the falling of the curtain or the\nclosing of the sepulchre doors.\n\nSure enough, in but a little while after, he fell into a sleep as gentle\nas an infant’s, which insensibly changed into the sleep of death.  I had\nmy arm about his body at the time and remarked nothing, unless it were\nthat he once stretched himself a little, so kindly the end came to that\ndisastrous life.  It was only at our evening halt that the Major and I\ndiscovered we were travelling alone with the poor clay.  That night we\nstole a spade from a field—I think near Market Bosworth—and a little\nfarther on, in a wood of young oak trees and by the light of King’s\nlantern, we buried the old soldier of the Empire with both prayers and\ntears.\n\nWe had needs invent Heaven if it had not been revealed to us; there are\nsome things that fall so bitterly ill on this side Time!  As for the\nMajor, I have long since forgiven him.  He broke the news to the poor\nColonel’s daughter; I am told he did it kindly; and sure, nobody could\nhave done it without tears!  His share of purgatory will be brief; and in\nthis world, as I could not very well praise him, I have suppressed his\nname.  The Colonel’s also, for the sake of his parole.  _Requiescat_.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV—THE ADVENTURE OF THE ATTORNEY’S CLERK\n\n\nI have mentioned our usual course, which was to eat in inconsiderable\nwayside hostelries, known to King.  It was a dangerous business; we went\ndaily under fire to satisfy our appetite, and put our head in the loin’s\nmouth for a piece of bread.  Sometimes, to minimise the risk, we would\nall dismount before we came in view of the house, straggle in severally,\nand give what orders we pleased, like disconnected strangers.  In like\nmanner we departed, to find the cart at an appointed place, some half a\nmile beyond.  The Colonel and the Major had each a word or two of\nEnglish—God help their pronunciation!  But they did well enough to order\na rasher and a pot or call a reckoning; and, to say truth, these country\nfolks did not give themselves the pains, and had scarce the knowledge, to\nbe critical.\n\nAbout nine or ten at night the pains of hunger and cold drove us to an\nalehouse in the flats of Bedfordshire, not far from Bedford itself.  In\nthe inn kitchen was a long, lean, characteristic-looking fellow of\nperhaps forty, dressed in black.  He sat on a settle by the fireside,\nsmoking a long pipe, such as they call a yard of clay.  His hat and wig\nwere hanged upon the knob behind him, his head as bald as a bladder of\nlard, and his expression very shrewd, cantankerous, and inquisitive.  He\nseemed to value himself above his company, to give himself the airs of a\nman of the world among that rustic herd; which was often no more than his\ndue; being, as I afterwards discovered, an attorney’s clerk.  I took upon\nmyself the more ungrateful part of arriving last; and by the time I\nentered on the scene the Major was already served at a side table.  Some\ngeneral conversation must have passed, and I smelled danger in the air.\nThe Major looked flustered, the attorney’s clerk triumphant, and three or\nfour peasants in smock-frocks (who sat about the fire to play chorus) had\nlet their pipes go out.\n\n‘Give you good evening, sir!’ said the attorney’s clerk to me.\n\n‘The same to you, sir,’ said I.\n\n‘I think this one will do,’ quoth the clerk to the yokels with a wink;\nand then, as soon as I had given my order, ‘Pray, sir, whither are you\nbound?’ he added.\n\n‘Sir,’ said I, ‘I am not one of those who speak either of their business\nor their destination in houses of public entertainment.’\n\n‘A good answer,’ said he, ‘and an excellent principle.  Sir, do you speak\nFrench?’\n\n‘Why, no, sir,’ said I.  ‘A little Spanish at your service.’\n\n‘But you know the French accent, perhaps?’ said the clerk.\n\n‘Well do I do that!’ said I.  ‘The French accent?  Why, I believe I can\ntell a Frenchman in ten words.’\n\n‘Here is a puzzle for you, then!’ he said.  ‘I have no material doubt\nmyself, but some of these gentlemen are more backward.  The lack of\neducation, you know.  I make bold to say that a man cannot walk, cannot\nhear, and cannot see, without the blessings of education.’\n\nHe turned to the Major, whose food plainly stuck in his throat.\n\n‘Now, sir,’ pursued the clerk, ‘let me have the pleasure to hear your\nvoice again.  Where are you going, did you say?’\n\n‘Sare, I am go-ing to Lon-don,’ said the Major.\n\nI could have flung my plate at him to be such an ass, and to have so\nlittle a gift of languages where that was the essential.\n\n‘What think ye of that?’ said the clerk.  ‘Is that French enough?’\n\n‘Good God!’ cried I, leaping up like one who should suddenly perceive an\nacquaintance, ‘is this you, Mr. Dubois?  Why, who would have dreamed of\nencountering you so far from home?’  As I spoke, I shook hands with the\nMajor heartily; and turning to our tormentor, ‘Oh, sir, you may be\nperfectly reassured!  This is a very honest fellow, a late neighbour of\nmine in the city of Carlisle.’\n\nI thought the attorney looked put out; I little knew the man!\n\n‘But he is French,’ said he, ‘for all that?’\n\n‘Ay, to be sure!’ said I.  ‘A Frenchman of the emigration!  None of your\nBuonaparte lot.  I will warrant his views of politics to be as sound as\nyour own.’\n\n‘What is a little strange,’ said the clerk quietly, ‘is that Mr. Dubois\nshould deny it.’\n\nI got it fair in the face, and took it smiling; but the shock was rude,\nand in the course of the next words I contrived to do what I have rarely\ndone, and make a slip in my English.  I kept my liberty and life by my\nproficiency all these months, and for once that I failed, it is not to be\nsupposed that I would make a public exhibition of the details.  Enough,\nthat it was a very little error, and one that might have passed\nninety-nine times in a hundred.  But my limb of the law was as swift to\npick it up as though he had been by trade a master of languages.\n\n‘Aha!’ cries he; ‘and you are French, too!  Your tongue bewrays you.  Two\nFrenchmen coming into an alehouse, severally and accidentally, not\nknowing each other, at ten of the clock at night, in the middle of\nBedfordshire?  No, sir, that shall not pass!  You are all prisoners\nescaping, if you are nothing worse.  Consider yourselves under arrest.  I\nhave to trouble you for your papers.’\n\n‘Where is your warrant, if you come to that?’ said I.  ‘My papers!  A\nlikely thing that I would show my papers on the _ipse dixit_ of an\nunknown fellow in a hedge alehouse!’\n\n‘Would you resist the law?’ says he.\n\n‘Not the law, sir!’ said I.  ‘I hope I am too good a subject for that.\nBut for a nameless fellow with a bald head and a pair of gingham\nsmall-clothes, why certainly!  ’Tis my birthright as an Englishman.\nWhere’s _Magna Charta_, else?’\n\n‘We will see about that,’ says he; and then, addressing the assistants,\n‘where does the constable live?’\n\n‘Lord love you, sir!’ cried the landlord, ‘what are you thinking of?  The\nconstable at past ten at night!  Why, he’s abed and asleep, and good and\ndrunk two hours agone!’\n\n‘Ah that a’ be!’ came in chorus from the yokels.\n\nThe attorney’s clerk was put to a stand.  He could not think of force;\nthere was little sign of martial ardour about the landlord, and the\npeasants were indifferent—they only listened, and gaped, and now\nscratched a head, and now would get a light to their pipes from the\nembers on the hearth.  On the other hand, the Major and I put a bold\nfront on the business and defied him, not without some ground of law.  In\nthis state of matters he proposed I should go along with him to one\nSquire Merton, a great man of the neighbourhood, who was in the\ncommission of the peace, the end of his avenue but three lanes away.  I\ntold him I would not stir a foot for him if it were to save his soul.\nNext he proposed I should stay all night where I was, and the constable\ncould see to my affair in the morning, when he was sober.  I replied I\nshould go when and where I pleased; that we were lawful travellers in the\nfear of God and the king, and I for one would suffer myself to be stayed\nby nobody.  At the same time, I was thinking the matter had lasted\naltogether too long, and I determined to bring it to an end at once.\n\n‘See here,’ said I, getting up, for till now I had remained carelessly\nseated, ‘there’s only one way to decide a thing like this—only one way\nthat’s right _English_—and that’s man to man.  Take off your coat, sir,\nand these gentlemen shall see fair play.’  At this there came a look in\nhis eye that I could not mistake.  His education had been neglected in\none essential and eminently British particular: he could not box.  No\nmore could I, you may say; but then I had the more impudence—and I had\nmade the proposal.\n\n‘He says I’m no Englishman, but the proof of the pudding is the eating of\nit,’ I continued.  And here I stripped my coat and fell into the proper\nattitude, which was just about all I knew of this barbarian art.  ‘Why,\nsir, you seem to me to hang back a little,’ said I.  ‘Come, I’ll meet\nyou; I’ll give you an appetiser—though hang me if I can understand the\nman that wants any enticement to hold up his hands.’  I drew a bank-note\nout of my fob and tossed it to the landlord.  ‘There are the stakes,’\nsaid I.  ‘I’ll fight you for first blood, since you seem to make so much\nwork about it.  If you tap my claret first, there are five guineas for\nyou, and I’ll go with you to any squire you choose to mention.  If I tap\nyours, you’ll perhaps let on that I’m the better man, and allow me to go\nabout my lawful business at my own time and convenience, by God; is that\nfair, my lads?’ says I, appealing to the company.\n\n‘Ay, ay,’ said the chorus of chawbacons; ‘he can’t say no fairer nor\nthat, he can’t.  Take off thy coat master!’\n\nThe limb of the law was now on the wrong side of public opinion, and,\nwhat heartened me to go on, the position was rapidly changing in our\nfavour.  Already the Major was paying his shot to the very indifferent\nlandlord, and I could see the white face of King at the back-door, making\nsignals of haste.\n\n‘Oho!’ quoth my enemy, ‘you are as full of doubles as a fox, are you not?\nBut I see through you; I see through and through you.  You would change\nthe venue, would you?’\n\n‘I may be transparent, sir,’ says I, ‘but if you’ll do me the favour to\nstand up, you’ll find I can hit dam hard.’\n\n‘Which is a point, if you will observe, that I had never called in\nquestion,’ said he.  ‘Why, you ignorant clowns,’ he proceeded, addressing\nthe company, ‘can’t you see the fellow’s gulling you before your eyes?\nCan’t you see that he has changed the point upon me?  I say he’s a French\nprisoner, and he answers that he can box!  What has that to do with it?\nI would not wonder but what he can dance, too—they’re all dancing masters\nover there.  I say, and I stick to it, that he’s a Frenchy.  He says he\nisn’t.  Well then, let him out with his papers, if he has them!  If he\nhad, would he not show them?  If he had, would he not jump at the idea of\ngoing to Squire Merton, a man you all know?  Now, you are all plain,\nstraightforward Bedfordshire men, and I wouldn’t ask a better lot to\nappeal to.  You’re not the kind to be talked over with any French gammon,\nand he’s plenty of that.  But let me tell him, he can take his pigs to\nanother market; they’ll never do here; they’ll never go down in\nBedfordshire.  Why! look at the man!  Look at his feet!  Has anybody got\na foot in the room like that?  See how he stands! do any of you fellows\nstand like that?  Does the landlord, there?  Why, he has Frenchman wrote\nall over him, as big as a sign-post!’\n\nThis was all very well; and in a different scene I might even have been\ngratified by his remarks; but I saw clearly, if I were to allow him to\ntalk, he might turn the tables on me altogether.  He might not be much of\na hand at boxing; but I was much mistaken, or he had studied forensic\neloquence in a good school.  In this predicament I could think of nothing\nmore ingenious than to burst out of the house, under the pretext of an\nungovernable rage.  It was certainly not very ingenious—it was\nelementary, but I had no choice.\n\n‘You white-livered dog!’ I broke out.  ‘Do you dare to tell me you’re an\nEnglishman, and won’t fight?  But I’ll stand no more of this!  I leave\nthis place, where I’ve been insulted!  Here! what’s to pay?  Pay\nyourself!’ I went on, offering the landlord a handful of silver, ‘and\ngive me back my bank-note!’\n\nThe landlord, following his usual policy of obliging everybody, offered\nno opposition to my design.  The position of my adversary was now\nthoroughly bad.  He had lost my two companions.  He was on the point of\nlosing me also.  There was plainly no hope of arousing the company to\nhelp; and watching him with a corner of my eye, I saw him hesitate for a\nmoment.  The next, he had taken down his hat and his wig, which was of\nblack horsehair; and I saw him draw from behind the settle a vast hooded\ngreat-coat and a small valise.  ‘The devil!’ thought I: ‘is the rascal\ngoing to follow me?’\n\nI was scarce clear of the inn before the limb of the law was at my heels.\nI saw his face plain in the moonlight; and the most resolute purpose\nshowed in it, along with an unmoved composure.  A chill went over me.\n‘This is no common adventure,’ thinks I to myself.  ‘You have got hold of\na man of character, St. Ives!  A bite-hard, a bull-dog, a weasel is on\nyour trail; and how are you to throw him off?’  Who was he?  By some of\nhis expressions I judged he was a hanger-on of courts.  But in what\ncharacter had he followed the assizes?  As a simple spectator, as a\nlawyer’s clerk, as a criminal himself, or—last and worst supposition—as a\nBow-street ‘runner’?\n\nThe cart would wait for me, perhaps, half a mile down our onward road,\nwhich I was already following.  And I told myself that in a few minutes’\nwalking, Bow-street runner or not, I should have him at my mercy.  And\nthen reflection came to me in time.  Of all things, one was out of the\nquestion.  Upon no account must this obtrusive fellow see the cart.\nUntil I had killed or shook him off, I was quite divorced from my\ncompanions—alone, in the midst of England, on a frosty by-way leading\nwhither I knew not, with a sleuth-hound at my heels, and never a friend\nbut the holly-stick!\n\nWe came at the same time to a crossing of lanes.  The branch to the left\nwas overhung with trees, deeply sunken and dark.  Not a ray of moonlight\npenetrated its recesses; and I took it at a venture.  The wretch followed\nmy example in silence; and for some time we crunched together over frozen\npools without a word.  Then he found his voice, with a chuckle.\n\n‘This is not the way to Mr. Merton’s,’ said he.\n\n‘No?’ said I. ‘It is mine, however.’\n\n‘And therefore mine,’ said he.\n\nAgain we fell silent; and we may thus have covered half a mile before the\nlane, taking a sudden turn, brought us forth again into the moonshine.\nWith his hooded great-coat on his back, his valise in his hand, his black\nwig adjusted, and footing it on the ice with a sort of sober doggedness\nof manner, my enemy was changed almost beyond recognition: changed in\neverything but a certain dry, polemical, pedantic air, that spoke of a\nsedentary occupation and high stools.  I observed, too, that his valise\nwas heavy; and, putting this and that together, hit upon a plan.\n\n‘A seasonable night, sir,’ said I.  ‘What do you say to a bit of running?\nThe frost has me by the toes.’\n\n‘With all the pleasure in life,’ says he.\n\nHis voice seemed well assured, which pleased me little.  However, there\nwas nothing else to try, except violence, for which it would always be\ntoo soon.  I took to my heels accordingly, he after me; and for some time\nthe slapping of our feet on the hard road might have been heard a mile\naway.  He had started a pace behind me, and he finished in the same\nposition.  For all his extra years and the weight of his valise, he had\nnot lost a hair’s breadth.  The devil might race him for me—I had enough\nof it!\n\nAnd, besides, to run so fast was contrary to my interests.  We could not\nrun long without arriving somewhere.  At any moment we might turn a\ncorner and find ourselves at the lodge-gate of some Squire Merton, in the\nmidst of a village whose constable was sober, or in the hands of a\npatrol.  There was no help for it—I must finish with him on the spot, as\nlong as it was possible.  I looked about me, and the place seemed\nsuitable; never a light, never a house—nothing but stubble-fields,\nfallows, and a few stunted trees.  I stopped and eyed him in the\nmoonlight with an angry stare.\n\n‘Enough of this foolery!’ said I.\n\nHe had tamed, and now faced me full, very pale, but with no sign of\nshrinking.\n\n‘I am quite of your opinion,’ said he.  ‘You have tried me at the\nrunning; you can try me next at the high jump.  It will be all the same.\nIt must end the one way.’\n\nI made my holly whistle about my head.\n\n‘I believe you know what way!’ said I.  ‘We are alone, it is night, and I\nam wholly resolved.  Are you not frightened?’\n\n‘No,’ he said, ‘not in the smallest.  I do not box, sir; but I am not a\ncoward, as you may have supposed.  Perhaps it will simplify our relations\nif I tell you at the outset that I walk armed.’\n\nQuick as lightning I made a feint at his head; as quickly he gave ground,\nand at the same time I saw a pistol glitter in his hand.\n\n‘No more of that, Mr. French-Prisoner!’ he said.  ‘It will do me no good\nto have your death at my door.’\n\n‘Faith, nor me either!’ said I; and I lowered my stick and considered the\nman, not without a twinkle of admiration.  ‘You see,’ I said, ‘there is\none consideration that you appear to overlook: there are a great many\nchances that your pistol may miss fire.’\n\n‘I have a pair,’ he returned.  ‘Never travel without a brace of barkers.’\n\n‘I make you my compliment,’ said I.  ‘You are able to take care of\nyourself, and that is a good trait.  But, my good man! let us look at\nthis matter dispassionately.  You are not a coward, and no more am I; we\nare both men of excellent sense; I have good reason, whatever it may be,\nto keep my concerns to myself and to walk alone.  Now I put it to you\npointedly, am I likely to stand it?  Am I likely to put up with your\ncontinued and—excuse me—highly impudent _ingérence_ into my private\naffairs?’\n\n‘Another French word,’ says he composedly.\n\n‘Oh! damn your French words!’ cried I.  ‘You seem to be a Frenchman\nyourself!’\n\n‘I have had many opportunities by which I have profited,’ he explained.\n‘Few men are better acquainted with the similarities and differences,\nwhether of idiom or accent, of the two languages.’\n\n‘You are a pompous fellow, too!’ said I.\n\n‘Oh, I can make distinctions, sir,’ says he.  ‘I can talk with\nBedfordshire peasants; and I can express myself becomingly, I hope, in\nthe company of a gentleman of education like yourself.’\n\n‘If you set up to be a gentleman—’ I began.\n\n‘Pardon me,’ he interrupted: ‘I make no such claim.  I only see the\nnobility and gentry in the way of business.  I am quite a plain person.’\n\n‘For the Lord’s sake,’ I exclaimed, ‘set my mind at rest upon one point.\nIn the name of mystery, who and what are you?’\n\n‘I have no cause to be ashamed of my name, sir,’ said he, ‘nor yet my\ntrade.  I am Thomas Dudgeon, at your service, clerk to Mr. Daniel\nRomaine, solicitor of London; High Holborn is our address, sir.’\n\nIt was only by the ecstasy of the relief that I knew how horribly I had\nbeen frightened.  I flung my stick on the road.\n\n‘Romaine?’ I cried.  ‘Daniel Romaine?  An old hunks with a red face and a\nbig head, and got up like a Quaker?  My dear friend, to my arms!’\n\n‘Keep back, I say!’ said Dudgeon weakly.\n\nI would not listen to him.  With the end of my own alarm, I felt as if I\nmust infallibly be at the end of all dangers likewise; as if the pistol\nthat he held in one hand were no more to be feared than the valise that\nhe carried with the other, and now put up like a barrier against my\nadvance.\n\n‘Keep back, or I declare I will fire,’ he was crying.  ‘Have a care, for\nGod’s sake!  My pistol—’\n\nHe might scream as be pleased.  Willy nilly, I folded him to my breast, I\npressed him there, I kissed his ugly mug as it had never been kissed\nbefore and would never be kissed again; and in the doing so knocked his\nwig awry and his hat off.  He bleated in my embrace; so bleats the sheep\nin the arms of the butcher.  The whole thing, on looking back, appears\nincomparably reckless and absurd; I no better than a madman for offering\nto advance on Dudgeon, and he no better than a fool for not shooting me\nwhile I was about it.  But all’s well that ends well; or, as the people\nin these days kept singing and whistling on the streets:—\n\n    ‘There’s a sweet little cherub that sits up aloft\n    And looks out for the life of poor Jack.’\n\n‘There!’ said I, releasing him a little, but still keeping my hands on\nhis shoulders, ‘_je vous ai bel et bien embrassé_—and, as you would say,\nthere is another French word.’  With his wig over one eye, he looked\nincredibly rueful and put out.  ‘Cheer up, Dudgeon; the ordeal is over,\nyou shall be embraced no more.  But do, first of all, for God’s-sake, put\naway your pistol; you handle it as if you were a cockatrice; some time or\nother, depend upon it, it will certainly go off.  Here is your hat.  No,\nlet me put it on square, and the wig before it.  Never suffer any stress\nof circumstances to come between you and the duty you owe to yourself.\nIf you have nobody else to dress for, dress for God!\n\n    ‘Put your wig straight\n    On your bald pate,\n    Keep your chin scraped,\n    And your figure draped.\n\nCan you match me that?  The whole duty of man in a quatrain!  And remark,\nI do not set up to be a professional bard; these are the outpourings of a\n_dilettante_.’\n\n‘But, my dear sir!’ he exclaimed.\n\n‘But, my dear sir!’ I echoed, ‘I will allow no man to interrupt the flow\nof my ideas.  Give me your opinion on my quatrain, or I vow we shall have\na quarrel of it.’\n\n‘Certainly you are quite an original,’ he said.\n\n‘Quite,’ said I; ‘and I believe I have my counterpart before me.’\n\n‘Well, for a choice,’ says he, smiling, ‘and whether for sense or poetry,\ngive me\n\n    ‘“Worth makes the man, and want of it the fellow:\n    The rest is all but leather and prunello.”’\n\n‘Oh, but that’s not fair—that’s Pope!  It’s not original, Dudgeon.\nUnderstand me,’ said I, wringing his breast-button, ‘the first duty of\nall poetry is to be mine, sir—mine.  Inspiration now swells in my bosom,\nbecause—to tell you the plain truth, and descend a little in style—I am\ndevilish relieved at the turn things have taken.  So, I dare say, are you\nyourself, Dudgeon, if you would only allow it.  And _à propos_, let me\nask you a home question.  Between friends, have you ever fired that\npistol?’\n\n‘Why, yes, sir,’ he replied.  ‘Twice—at hedgesparrows.’\n\n‘And you would have fired at me, you bloody-minded man?’ I cried.\n\n‘If you go to that, you seemed mighty reckless with your stick,’ said\nDudgeon.\n\n‘Did I indeed?  Well, well, ’tis all past history; ancient as King\nPharamond—which is another French word, if you cared to accumulate more\nevidence,’ says I.  ‘But happily we are now the best of friends, and have\nall our interests in common.’\n\n‘You go a little too fast, if you’ll excuse me, Mr. ---: I do not know\nyour name, that I am aware,’ said Dudgeon.\n\n‘No, to be sure!’ said I.  ‘Never heard of it!’\n\n‘A word of explanation—’ he began.\n\n‘No, Dudgeon!’ I interrupted.  ‘Be practical; I know what you want, and\nthe name of it is supper.  _Rien ne creuse comme l’emotion_.  I am hungry\nmyself, and yet I am more accustomed to warlike palpitations than you,\nwho are but a hunter of hedgesparrows.  Let me look at your face\ncritically: your bill of fare is three slices of cold rare roast beef, a\nWelsh rabbit, a pot of stout, and a glass or two of sound tawny port, old\nin bottle—the right milk of Englishmen.’  Methought there seemed a\nbrightening in his eye and a melting about his mouth at this enumeration.\n\n‘The night is young,’ I continued; ‘not much past eleven, for a wager.\nWhere can we find a good inn?  And remark that I say _good_, for the port\nmust be up to the occasion—not a headache in a pipe of it.’\n\n‘Really, sir,’ he said, smiling a little, ‘you have a way of carrying\nthings—’\n\n‘Will nothing make you stick to the subject?’ I cried; ‘you have the most\nirrelevant mind!  How do you expect to rise in your profession?  The\ninn?’\n\n‘Well, I will say you are a facetious gentleman!’ said he.  ‘You must\nhave your way, I see.  We are not three miles from Bedford by this very\nroad.’\n\n‘Done!’ cried I.  ‘Bedford be it!’\n\nI tucked his arm under mine, possessed myself of the valise, and walked\nhim off unresisting.  Presently we came to an open piece of country lying\na thought downhill.  The road was smooth and free of ice, the moonshine\nthin and bright over the meadows and the leafless trees.  I was now\nhonestly done with the purgatory of the covered cart; I was close to my\ngreat-uncle’s; I had no more fear of Mr. Dudgeon; which were all grounds\nenough for jollity.  And I was aware, besides, of us two as of a pair of\ntiny and solitary dolls under the vast frosty cupola of the midnight; the\nrooms decked, the moon burnished, the least of the stars lighted, the\nfloor swept and waxed, and nothing wanting but for the band to strike up\nand the dancing to begin.  In the exhilaration of my heart I took the\nmusic on myself—\n\n    ‘Merrily danced the Quaker’s wife,\n    And merrily danced the Quaker.’\n\nI broke into that animated and appropriate air, clapped my arm about\nDudgeon’s waist, and away down the hill at a dancing step!  He hung back\na little at the start, but the impulse of the tune, the night, and my\nexample, were not to be resisted.  A man made of putty must have danced,\nand even Dudgeon showed himself to be a human being.  Higher and higher\nwere the capers that we cut; the moon repeated in shadow our antic\nfootsteps and gestures; and it came over my mind of a sudden—really like\nbalm—what appearance of man I was dancing with, what a long bilious\ncountenance he had shown under his shaven pate, and what a world of\ntrouble the rascal had given me in the immediate past.\n\nPresently we began to see the lights of Bedford.  My Puritanic companion\nstopped and disengaged himself.\n\n‘This is a trifle _infra dig._, sir, is it not?’ said he.  ‘A party might\nsuppose we had been drinking.’\n\n‘And so you shall be, Dudgeon,’ said I.  ‘You shall not only be drinking,\nyou old hypocrite, but you shall be drunk—dead drunk, sir—and the boots\nshall put you to bed!  We’ll warn him when we go in.  Never neglect a\nprecaution; never put off till to-morrow what you can do to-day!’\n\nBut he had no more frivolity to complain of.  We finished our stage and\ncame to the inn-door with decorum, to find the house still alight and in\na bustle with many late arrivals; to give our orders with a prompt\nseverity which ensured obedience, and to be served soon after at a\nside-table, close to the fire and in a blaze of candle-light, with such a\nmeal as I had been dreaming of for days past.  For days, you are to\nremember, I had been skulking in the covered cart, a prey to cold,\nhunger, and an accumulation of discomforts that might have daunted the\nmost brave; and the white table napery, the bright crystal, the\nreverberation of the fire, the red curtains, the Turkey carpet, the\nportraits on the coffee-room wall, the placid faces of the two or three\nlate guests who were silently prolonging the pleasures of digestion, and\n(last, but not by any means least) a glass of an excellent light dry\nport, put me in a humour only to be described as heavenly.  The thought\nof the Colonel, of how he would have enjoyed this snug room and roaring\nfire, and of his cold grave in the wood by Market Bosworth, lingered on\nmy palate, _amari aliquid_, like an after-taste, but was not able—I say\nit with shame—entirely to dispel my self-complacency.  After all, in this\nworld every dog hangs by its own tail.  I was a free adventurer, who had\njust brought to a successful end—or, at least, within view of it—an\nadventure very difficult and alarming; and I looked across at Mr.\nDudgeon, as the port rose to his cheeks, and a smile, that was\nsemi-confidential and a trifle foolish, began to play upon his leathery\nfeatures, not only with composure, but with a suspicion of kindness.  The\nrascal had been brave, a quality for which I would value the devil; and\nif he had been pertinacious in the beginning, he had more than made up\nfor it before the end.\n\n‘And now, Dudgeon, to explain,’ I began.  ‘I know your master, he knows\nme, and he knows and approves of my errand.  So much I may tell you, that\nI am on my way to Amersham Place.’\n\n‘Oho!’ quoth Dudgeon, ‘I begin to see.’\n\n‘I am heartily glad of it,’ said I, passing the bottle, ‘because that is\nabout all I can tell you.  You must take my word for the remainder.\nEither believe me or don’t.  If you don’t, let’s take a chaise; you can\ncarry me to-morrow to High Holborn, and confront me with Mr. Romaine; the\nresult of which will be to set your mind at rest—and to make the holiest\ndisorder in your master’s plans.  If I judge you aright (for I find you a\nshrewd fellow), this will not be at all to your mind.  You know what a\nsubordinate gets by officiousness; if I can trust my memory, old Romaine\nhas not at all the face that I should care to see in anger; and I venture\nto predict surprising results upon your weekly salary—if you are paid by\nthe week, that is.  In short, let me go free, and ’tis an end of the\nmatter; take me to London, and ’tis only a beginning—and, by my opinion,\na beginning of troubles.  You can take your choice.’\n\n‘And that is soon taken,’ said he.  ‘Go to Amersham tomorrow, or go to\nthe devil if you prefer—I wash my hands of you and the whole transaction.\nNo, you don’t find me putting my head in between Romaine and a client!  A\ngood man of business, sir, but hard as millstone grit.  I might get the\nsack, and I shouldn’t wonder!  But, it’s a pity, too,’ he added, and\nsighed, shook his head, and took his glass off sadly.\n\n‘That reminds me,’ said I.  ‘I have a great curiosity, and you can\nsatisfy it.  Why were you so forward to meddle with poor Mr. Dubois?  Why\ndid you transfer your attentions to me?  And generally, what induced you\nto make yourself such a nuisance?’\n\nHe blushed deeply.\n\n‘Why, sir,’ says he, ‘there is such a thing as patriotism, I hope.’\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI—THE HOME-COMING OF MR. ROWLEY’S VISCOUNT\n\n\nBy eight the next morning Dudgeon and I had made our parting.  By that\ntime we had grown to be extremely familiar; and I would very willingly\nhave kept him by me, and even carried him to Amersham Place.  But it\nappeared he was due at the public-house where we had met, on some affairs\nof my great-uncle the Count, who had an outlying estate in that part of\nthe shire.  If Dudgeon had had his way the night before, I should have\nbeen arrested on my uncle’s land and by my uncle’s agent, a culmination\nof ill-luck.\n\nA little after noon I started, in a hired chaise, by way of Dunstable.\nThe mere mention of the name Amersham Place made every one supple and\nsmiling.  It was plainly a great house, and my uncle lived there in\nstyle.  The fame of it rose as we approached, like a chain of mountains;\nat Bedford they touched their caps, but in Dunstable they crawled upon\ntheir bellies.  I thought the landlady would have kissed me; such a\nflutter of cordiality, such smiles, such affectionate attentions were\ncalled forth, and the good lady bustled on my service in such a pother of\nringlets and with such a jingling of keys.  ‘You’re probably expected,\nsir, at the Place?  I do trust you may ’ave better accounts of his\nlordship’s ’elth, sir.  We understood that his lordship, Mosha de\nCarwell, was main bad.  Ha, sir, we shall all feel his loss, poor, dear,\nnoble gentleman; and I’m sure nobody more polite!  They do say, sir, his\nwealth is enormous, and before the Revolution, quite a prince in his own\ncountry!  But I beg your pardon, sir; ’ow I do run on, to be sure; and\ndoubtless all beknown to you already!  For you do resemble the family,\nsir.  I should have known you anywheres by the likeness to the dear\nviscount.  Ha, poor gentleman, he must ’ave a ’eavy ’eart these days.’\n\nIn the same place I saw out of the inn-windows a man-servant passing in\nthe livery of my house, which you are to think I had never before seen\nworn, or not that I could remember.  I had often enough, indeed, pictured\nmyself advanced to be a Marshal, a Duke of the Empire, a Grand Cross of\nthe Legion of Honour, and some other kickshaws of the kind, with a\nperfect rout of flunkeys correctly dressed in my own colours.  But it is\none thing to imagine, and another to see; it would be one thing to have\nthese liveries in a house of my own in Paris—it was quite another to find\nthem flaunting in the heart of hostile England; and I fear I should have\nmade a fool of myself, if the man had not been on the other side of the\nstreet, and I at a one-pane window.  There was something illusory in this\ntransplantation of the wealth and honours of a family, a thing by its\nnature so deeply rooted in the soil; something ghostly in this sense of\nhome-coming so far from home.\n\nFrom Dunstable I rolled away into a crescendo of similar impressions.\nThere are certainly few things to be compared with these castles, or\nrather country seats, of the English nobility and gentry; nor anything at\nall to equal the servility of the population that dwells in their\nneighbourhood.  Though I was but driving in a hired chaise, word of my\ndestination seemed to have gone abroad, and the women curtseyed and the\nmen louted to me by the wayside.  As I came near, I began to appreciate\nthe roots of this widespread respect.  The look of my uncle’s park wall,\neven from the outside, had something of a princely character; and when I\ncame in view of the house itself, a sort of madness of vicarious\nvain-glory struck me dumb and kept me staring.  It was about the size of\nthe Tuileries.  It faced due north; and the last rays of the sun, that\nwas setting like a red-hot shot amidst a tumultuous gathering of snow\nclouds, were reflected on the endless rows of windows.  A portico of\nDoric columns adorned the front, and would have done honour to a temple.\nThe servant who received me at the door was civil to a fault—I had almost\nsaid, to offence; and the hall to which he admitted me through a pair of\nglass doors was warmed and already partly lighted by a liberal chimney\nheaped with the roots of beeches.\n\n‘Vicomte Anne de St. Yves,’ said I, in answer to the man’s question;\nwhereupon he bowed before me lower still, and stepping upon one side\nintroduced me to the truly awful presence of the major-domo.  I have seen\nmany dignitaries in my time, but none who quite equalled this eminent\nbeing; who was good enough to answer to the unassuming name of Dawson.\nFrom him I learned that my uncle was extremely low, a doctor in close\nattendance, Mr. Romaine expected at any moment, and that my cousin, the\nVicomte de St. Yves, had been sent for the same morning.\n\n‘It was a sudden seizure, then?’ I asked.\n\nWell, he would scarcely go as far as that.  It was a decline, a fading\naway, sir; but he was certainly took bad the day before, had sent for Mr.\nRomaine, and the major-domo had taken it on himself a little later to\nsend word to the Viscount.  ‘It seemed to me, my lord,’ said he, ‘as if\nthis was a time when all the fambly should be called together.’\n\nI approved him with my lips, but not in my heart.  Dawson was plainly in\nthe interests of my cousin.\n\n‘And when can I expect to see my great-uncle, the Count?’ said I.\n\nIn the evening, I was told; in the meantime he would show me to my room,\nwhich had been long prepared for me, and I should be expected to dine in\nabout an hour with the doctor, if my lordship had no objections.\n\nMy lordship had not the faintest.\n\n‘At the same time,’ I said, ‘I have had an accident: I have unhappily\nlost my baggage, and am here in what I stand in.  I don’t know if the\ndoctor be a formalist, but it is quite impossible I should appear at\ntable as I ought.’\n\nHe begged me to be under no anxiety.  ‘We have been long expecting you,’\nsaid he.  ‘All is ready.’\n\nSuch I found to be the truth.  A great room had been prepared for me;\nthrough the mullioned windows the last flicker of the winter sunset\ninterchanged with the reverberation of a royal fire; the bed was open, a\nsuit of evening clothes was airing before the blaze, and from the far\ncorner a boy came forward with deprecatory smiles.  The dream in which I\nhad been moving seemed to have reached its pitch.  I might have quitted\nthis house and room only the night before; it was my own place that I had\ncome to; and for the first time in my life I understood the force of the\nwords home and welcome.\n\n‘This will be all as you would want, sir?’ said Mr. Dawson.  ‘This ’ere\nboy, Rowley, we place entirely at your disposition.  ’E’s not exactly a\ntrained vallet, but Mossho Powl, the Viscount’s gentleman, ’ave give him\nthe benefick of a few lessons, and it is ’oped that he may give\nsitisfection.  Hanythink that you may require, if you will be so good as\nto mention the same to Rowley, I will make it my business myself, sir, to\nsee you sitisfied.’\n\nSo saying, the eminent and already detested Mr. Dawson took his\ndeparture, and I was left alone with Rowley.  A man who may be said to\nhave wakened to consciousness in the prison of the Abbaye, among those\never graceful and ever tragic figures of the brave and fair, awaiting the\nhour of the guillotine and denuded of every comfort, I had never known\nthe luxuries or the amenities of my rank in life.  To be attended on by\nservants I had only been accustomed to in inns.  My toilet had long been\nmilitary, to a moment, at the note of a bugle, too often at a ditch-side.\nAnd it need not be wondered at if I looked on my new valet with a certain\ndiffidence.  But I remembered that if he was my first experience of a\nvalet, I was his first trial as a master.  Cheered by which\nconsideration, I demanded my bath in a style of good assurance.  There\nwas a bathroom contiguous; in an incredibly short space of time the hot\nwater was ready; and soon after, arrayed in a shawl dressing-gown, and in\na luxury of contentment and comfort, I was reclined in an easy-chair\nbefore the mirror, while Rowley, with a mixture of pride and anxiety\nwhich I could well understand, laid out his razors.\n\n‘Hey, Rowley?’ I asked, not quite resigned to go under fire with such an\ninexperienced commander.  ‘It’s all right, is it?  You feel pretty sure\nof your weapons?’\n\n‘Yes, my lord,’ he replied.  ‘It’s all right, I assure your lordship.’\n\n‘I beg your pardon, Mr. Rowley, ‘but for the sake of shortness, would you\nmind not belording me in private?’ said I.  ‘It will do very well if you\ncall me Mr. Anne.  It is the way of my country, as I dare say you know.’\n\nMr. Rowley looked blank.\n\n‘But you’re just as much a Viscount as Mr. Powl’s, are you not?’ he said.\n\n‘As Mr. Powl’s Viscount?’ said I, laughing.  ‘Oh, keep your mind easy,\nMr. Rowley’s is every bit as good.  Only, you see, as I am of the younger\nline, I bear my Christian name along with the title.  Alain is the\n_Viscount_; I am the _Viscount Anne_.  And in giving me the name of Mr.\nAnne, I assure you you will be quite regular.’\n\n‘Yes, Mr. Anne,’ said the docile youth.  ‘But about the shaving, sir, you\nneed be under no alarm.  Mr. Powl says I ’ave excellent dispositions.’\n\n‘Mr. Powl?’ said I.  ‘That doesn’t seem to me very like a French name.’\n\n‘No, sir, indeed, my lord,’ said he, with a burst of confidence.  ‘No,\nindeed, Mr. Anne, and it do not surely.  I should say now, it was more\nlike Mr. Pole.’\n\n‘And Mr. Powl is the Viscount’s man?’\n\n‘Yes, Mr. Anne,’ said he.  ‘He ’ave a hard billet, he do.  The Viscount\nis a very particular gentleman.  I don’t think as you’ll be, Mr. Anne?’\nhe added, with a confidential smile in the mirror.\n\nHe was about sixteen, well set up, with a pleasant, merry, freckled face,\nand a pair of dancing eyes.  There was an air at once deprecatory and\ninsinuating about the rascal that I thought I recognised.  There came to\nme from my own boyhood memories of certain passionate admirations long\npassed away, and the objects of them long ago discredited or dead.  I\nremembered how anxious I had been to serve those fleeting heroes, how\nreadily I told myself I would have died for _them_, how much greater and\nhandsomer than life they had appeared.  And looking in the mirror, it\nseemed to me that I read the face of Rowley, like an echo or a ghost, by\nthe light of my own youth.  I have always contended (somewhat against the\nopinion of my friends) that I am first of all an economist; and the last\nthing that I would care to throw away is that very valuable piece of\nproperty—a boy’s hero-worship.\n\n‘Why,’ said I, ‘you shave like an angel, Mr. Rowley!’\n\n‘Thank you, my lord,’ says he.  ‘Mr. Powl had no fear of me. You may be\nsure, sir, I should never ’ave had this berth if I ’adn’t ’ave been up to\nDick.  We been expecting of you this month back.  My eye!  I never see\nsuch preparations.  Every day the fires has been kep’ up, the bed made,\nand all!  As soon as it was known you were coming, sir, I got the\nappointment; and I’ve been up and down since then like a Jack-in-the-box.\nA wheel couldn’t sound in the avenue but what I was at the window!  I’ve\nhad a many disappointments; but to-night, as soon as you stepped out of\nthe shay, I knew it was my—it was you.  Oh, you had been expected!  Why,\nwhen I go down to supper, I’ll be the ’ero of the servants’ ’all: the\n’ole of the staff is that curious!’\n\n‘Well,’ said I, ‘I hope you may be able to give a fair account of\nme—sober, steady, industrious, good-tempered, and with a first-rate\ncharacter from my last place?’\n\nHe laughed an embarrassed laugh.  ‘Your hair curls beautiful,’ he said,\nby way of changing the subject.  ‘The Viscount’s the boy for curls,\nthough; and the richness of it is, Mr. Powl tells me his don’t curl no\nmore than that much twine—by nature.  Gettin’ old, the Viscount is.  He\n’_ave_ gone the pace, ’aven’t ’e, sir?’\n\n‘The fact is,’ said I, ‘that I know very little about him.  Our family\nhas been much divided, and I have been a soldier from a child.’\n\n‘A soldier, Mr. Anne, sir?’ cried Rowley, with a sudden feverish\nanimation.  ‘Was you ever wounded?’\n\nIt is contrary to my principles to discourage admiration for myself; and,\nslipping back the shoulder of the dressing-gown, I silently exhibited the\nscar which I had received in Edinburgh Castle.  He looked at it with awe.\n\n‘Ah, well!’ he continued, ‘there’s where the difference comes in!  It’s\nin the training.  The other Viscount have been horse-racing, and dicing,\nand carrying on all his life.  All right enough, no doubt; but what I do\nsay is, that it don’t lead to nothink.  Whereas—’\n\n‘Whereas Mr. Rowley’s?’ I put in.\n\n‘My Viscount?’ said he.  ‘Well, sir, I _did_ say it; and now that I’ve\nseen you, I say it again!’\n\nI could not refrain from smiling at this outburst, and the rascal caught\nme in the mirror and smiled to me again.\n\n‘I’d say it again, Mr. Hanne,’ he said.  ‘I know which side my bread’s\nbuttered.  I know when a gen’leman’s a gen’leman.  Mr. Powl can go to\nPutney with his one!  Beg your pardon, Mr. Anne, for being so familiar,’\nsaid he, blushing suddenly scarlet.  ‘I was especially warned against it\nby Mr. Powl.’\n\n‘Discipline before all,’ said I.  ‘Follow your front-rank man.\n\nWith that, we began to turn our attention to the clothes.  I was amazed\nto find them fit so well: not _à la diable_, in the haphazard manner of a\nsoldier’s uniform or a ready-made suit; but with nicety, as a trained\nartist might rejoice to make them for a favourite subject.\n\n‘’Tis extraordinary,’ cried I: ‘these things fit me perfectly.’\n\n‘Indeed, Mr. Anne, you two be very much of a shape,’ said Rowley.\n\n‘Who?  What two?’ said I.\n\n‘The Viscount,’ he said.\n\n‘Damnation!  Have I the man’s clothes on me, too?’ cried I.\n\nBut Rowley hastened to reassure me.  On the first word of my coming, the\nCount had put the matter of my wardrobe in the hands of his own and my\ncousin’s tailors; and on the rumour of our resemblance, my clothes had\nbeen made to Alain’s measure.\n\n‘But they were all made for you express, Mr. Anne.  You may be certain\nthe Count would never do nothing by ’alf: fires kep’ burning; the finest\nof clothes ordered, I’m sure, and a body-servant being trained\na-purpose.’\n\n‘Well,’ said I, ‘it’s a good fire, and a good set-out of clothes; and\nwhat a valet, Mr. Rowley!  And there’s one thing to be said for my\ncousin—I mean for Mr. Powl’s Viscount—he has a very fair figure.’\n\n‘Oh, don’t you be took in, Mr. Anne,’ quoth the faithless Rowley: ‘he has\nto be hyked into a pair of stays to get them things on!’\n\n‘Come, come, Mr. Rowley,’ said I, ‘this is telling tales out of school!\nDo not you be deceived.  The greatest men of antiquity, including Caesar\nand Hannibal and Pope Joan, may have been very glad, at my time of life\nor Alain’s, to follow his example.  ’Tis a misfortune common to all; and\nreally,’ said I, bowing to myself before the mirror like one who should\ndance the minuet, ‘when the result is so successful as this, who would do\nanything but applaud?’\n\nMy toilet concluded, I marched on to fresh surprises.  My chamber, my new\nvalet and my new clothes had been beyond hope: the dinner, the soup, the\nwhole bill of fare was a revelation of the powers there are in man.  I\nhad not supposed it lay in the genius of any cook to create, out of\ncommon beef and mutton, things so different and dainty.  The wine was of\na piece, the doctor a most agreeable companion; nor could I help\nreflecting on the prospect that all this wealth, comfort and handsome\nprofusion might still very possibly become mine.  Here were a change\nindeed, from the common soldier and the camp kettle, the prisoner and his\nprison rations, the fugitive and the horrors of the covered cart!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII—THE DESPATCH-BOX\n\n\nThe doctor had scarce finished his meal before he hastened with an\napology to attend upon his patient; and almost immediately after I was\nmyself summoned and ushered up the great staircase and along interminable\ncorridors to the bedside of my great-uncle the Count.  You are to think\nthat up to the present moment I had not set eyes on this formidable\npersonage, only on the evidences of his wealth and kindness.  You are to\nthink besides that I had heard him miscalled and abused from my earliest\nchildhood up.  The first of the _émigrés_ could never expect a good word\nin the society in which my father moved.  Even yet the reports I received\nwere of a doubtful nature; even Romaine had drawn of him no very amiable\nportrait; and as I was ushered into the room, it was a critical eye that\nI cast on my great-uncle.  He lay propped on pillows in a little cot no\ngreater than a camp-bed, not visibly breathing.  He was about eighty\nyears of age, and looked it; not that his face was much lined, but all\nthe blood and colour seemed to have faded from his body, and even his\neyes, which last he kept usually closed as though the light distressed\nhim.  There was an unspeakable degree of slyness in his expression, which\nkept me ill at ease; he seemed to lie there with his arms folded, like a\nspider waiting for prey.  His speech was very deliberate and courteous,\nbut scarce louder than a sigh.\n\n‘I bid you welcome, _Monsieur le Vicomte Anne_,’ said he, looking at me\nhard with his pale eyes, but not moving on his pillows.  ‘I have sent for\nyou, and I thank you for the obliging expedition you have shown.  It is\nmy misfortune that I cannot rise to receive you.  I trust you have been\nreasonably well entertained?’\n\n‘_Monsieur mon oncle_,’ I said, bowing very low, ‘I am come at the\nsummons of the head of my family.’\n\n‘It is well,’ he said.  ‘Be seated.  I should be glad to hear some\nnews—if that can be called news that is already twenty years old—of how I\nhave the pleasure to see you here.’\n\nBy the coldness of his address, not more than by the nature of the times\nthat he bade me recall, I was plunged in melancholy.  I felt myself\nsurrounded as with deserts of friendlessness, and the delight of my\nwelcome was turned to ashes in my mouth.\n\n‘That is soon told, _monseigneur_,’ said I.  ‘I understand that I need\ntell you nothing of the end of my unhappy parents?  It is only the story\nof the lost dog.’\n\n‘You are right.  I am sufficiently informed of that deplorable affair; it\nis painful to me.  My nephew, your father, was a man who would not be\nadvised,’ said he.  ‘Tell me, if you please, simply of yourself.’\n\n‘I am afraid I must run the risk of harrowing your sensibility in the\nbeginning,’ said I, with a bitter smile, ‘because my story begins at the\nfoot of the guillotine.  When the list came out that night, and her name\nwas there, I was already old enough, not in years but in sad experience,\nto understand the extent of my misfortune.  She—’  I paused.  ‘Enough\nthat she arranged with a friend, Madame de Chasserades, that she should\ntake charge of me, and by the favour of our jailers I was suffered to\nremain in the shelter of the _Abbaye_.  That was my only refuge; there\nwas no corner of France that I could rest the sole of my foot upon except\nthe prison.  Monsieur le Comte, you are as well aware as I can be what\nkind of a life that was, and how swiftly death smote in that society.  I\ndid not wait long before the name of Madame de Chasserades succeeded to\nthat of my mother on the list.  She passed me on to Madame de Noytot;\nshe, in her turn, to Mademoiselle de Braye; and there were others.  I was\nthe one thing permanent; they were all transient as clouds; a day or two\nof their care, and then came the last farewell and—somewhere far off in\nthat roaring Paris that surrounded us—the bloody scene.  I was the\ncherished one, the last comfort, of these dying women.  I have been in\npitched fights, my lord, and I never knew such courage.  It was all done\nsmiling, in the tone of good society; _belle maman_ was the name I was\ntaught to give to each; and for a day or two the new “pretty mamma” would\nmake much of me, show me off, teach me the minuet, and to say my prayers;\nand then, with a tender embrace, would go the way of her predecessors,\nsmiling.  There were some that wept too.  There was a childhood!  All the\ntime Monsieur de Culemberg kept his eye on me, and would have had me out\nof the _Abbaye_ and in his own protection, but my “pretty mammas” one\nafter another resisted the idea.  Where could I be safer? they argued;\nand what was to become of them without the darling of the prison?  Well,\nit was soon shown how safe I was!  The dreadful day of the massacre came;\nthe prison was overrun; none paid attention to me, not even the last of\nmy “pretty mammas,” for she had met another fate.  I was wandering\ndistracted, when I was found by some one in the interests of Monsieur de\nCulemberg.  I understand he was sent on purpose; I believe, in order to\nreach the interior of the prison, he had set his hand to nameless\nbarbarities: such was the price paid for my worthless, whimpering little\nlife!  He gave me his hand; it was wet, and mine was reddened; he led me\nunresisting.  I remember but the one circumstance of my flight—it was my\nlast view of my last pretty mamma.  Shall I describe it to you?’ I asked\nthe Count, with a sudden fierceness.\n\n‘Avoid unpleasant details,’ observed my great-uncle gently.\n\nAt these words a sudden peace fell upon me.  I had been angry with the\nman before; I had not sought to spare him; and now, in a moment, I saw\nthat there was nothing to spare.  Whether from natural heartlessness or\nextreme old age, the soul was not at home; and my benefactor, who had\nkept the fire lit in my room for a month past—my only relative except\nAlain, whom I knew already to be a hired spy—had trodden out the last\nsparks of hope and interest.\n\n‘Certainly,’ said I; ‘and, indeed, the day for them is nearly over.  I\nwas taken to Monsieur de Culemberg’s,—I presume, sir, that you know the\nAbbe de Culemberg?’\n\nHe indicated assent without opening his eyes.\n\n‘He was a very brave and a very learned man—’\n\n‘And a very holy one,’ said my uncle civilly.\n\n‘And a very holy one, as you observe,’ I continued.  ‘He did an infinity\nof good, and through all the Terror kept himself from the guillotine.  He\nbrought me up, and gave me such education as I have.  It was in his house\nin the country at Dammarie, near Melun, that I made the acquaintance of\nyour agent, Mr. Vicary, who lay there in hiding, only to fall a victim at\nthe last to a gang of _chauffeurs_.’\n\n‘That poor Mr. Vicary!’ observed my uncle.  ‘He had been many times in my\ninterests to France, and this was his first failure.  _Quel charmant\nhomme_, _n’est-ce pas_?’\n\n‘Infinitely so,’ said I.  ‘But I would not willingly detain you any\nfurther with a story, the details of which it must naturally be more or\nless unpleasant for you to hear.  Suffice it that, by M. de Culemberg’s\nown advice, I said farewell at eighteen to that kind preceptor and his\nbooks, and entered the service of France; and have since then carried\narms in such a manner as not to disgrace my family.’\n\n‘You narrate well; _vous aves la voix chaude_,’ said my uncle, turning on\nhis pillows as if to study me.  ‘I have a very good account of you by\nMonsieur de Mauseant, whom you helped in Spain.  And you had some\neducation from the Abbe de Culemberg, a man of a good house?  Yes, you\nwill do very well.  You have a good manner and a handsome person, which\nhurts nothing.  We are all handsome in the family; even I myself, I have\nhad my successes, the memories of which still charm me.  It is my\nintention, my nephew, to make of you my heir.  I am not very well content\nwith my other nephew, Monsieur le Vicomte: he has not been respectful,\nwhich is the flattery due to age.  And there are other matters.’\n\nI was half tempted to throw back in his face that inheritance so coldly\noffered.  At the same time I had to consider that he was an old man, and,\nafter all, my relation; and that I was a poor one, in considerable\nstraits, with a hope at heart which that inheritance might yet enable me\nto realise.  Nor could I forget that, however icy his manners, he had\nbehaved to me from the first with the extreme of liberality and—I was\nabout to write, kindness, but the word, in that connection, would not\ncome.  I really owed the man some measure of gratitude, which it would be\nan ill manner to repay if I were to insult him on his deathbed.\n\n‘Your will, monsieur, must ever be my rule,’ said I, bowing.\n\n‘You have wit, _monsieur mon neveu_,’ said he, ‘the best wit—the wit of\nsilence.  Many might have deafened me with their gratitude.  Gratitude!’\nhe repeated, with a peculiar intonation, and lay and smiled to himself.\n‘But to approach what is more important.  As a prisoner of war, will it\nbe possible for you to be served heir to English estates?  I have no\nidea: long as I have dwelt in England, I have never studied what they\ncall their laws.  On the other hand, how if Romaine should come too late?\nI have two pieces of business to be transacted—to die, and to make my\nwill; and, however desirous I may be to serve you, I cannot postpone the\nfirst in favour of the second beyond a very few hours.’\n\n‘Well, sir, I must then contrive to be doing as I did before,’ said I.\n\n‘Not so,’ said the Count.  ‘I have an alternative.  I have just drawn my\nbalance at my banker’s, a considerable sum, and I am now to place it in\nyour hands.  It will be so much for you and so much less—’ he paused, and\nsmiled with an air of malignity that surprised me.  ‘But it is necessary\nit should be done before witnesses.  _Monsieur le Vicomte_ is of a\nparticular disposition, and an unwitnessed donation may very easily be\ntwisted into a theft.’\n\nHe touched a bell, which was answered by a man having the appearance of a\nconfidential valet.  To him he gave a key.\n\n‘Bring me the despatch-box that came yesterday, La Ferriere,’ said he.\n‘You will at the same time present my compliments to Dr. Hunter and M.\nl’Abbe, and request them to step for a few moments to my room.’\n\nThe despatch-box proved to be rather a bulky piece of baggage, covered\nwith Russia leather.  Before the doctor and an excellent old smiling\npriest it was passed over into my hands with a very clear statement of\nthe disposer’s wishes; immediately after which, though the witnesses\nremained behind to draw up and sign a joint note of the transaction,\nMonsieur de Kéroual dismissed me to my own room, La Ferriere following\nwith the invaluable box.\n\nAt my chamber door I took it from him with thanks, and entered alone.\nEverything had been already disposed for the night, the curtains drawn\nand the fire trimmed; and Rowley was still busy with my bedclothes.  He\nturned round as I entered with a look of welcome that did my heart good.\nIndeed, I had never a much greater need of human sympathy, however\ntrivial, than at that moment when I held a fortune in my arms.  In my\nuncle’s room I had breathed the very atmosphere of disenchantment.  He\nhad gorged my pockets; he had starved every dignified or affectionate\nsentiment of a man.  I had received so chilling an impression of age and\nexperience that the mere look of youth drew me to confide in Rowley: he\nwas only a boy, his heart must beat yet, he must still retain some\ninnocence and natural feelings, he could blurt out follies with his\nmouth, he was not a machine to utter perfect speech!  At the same time, I\nwas beginning to outgrow the painful impressions of my interview; my\nspirits were beginning to revive; and at the jolly, empty looks of Mr.\nRowley, as he ran forward to relieve me of the box, St. Ives became\nhimself again.\n\n‘Now, Rowley, don’t be in a hurry,’ said I.  ‘This is a momentous\njuncture.  Man and boy, you have been in my service about three hours.\nYou must already have observed that I am a gentleman of a somewhat morose\ndisposition, and there is nothing that I more dislike than the smallest\nappearance of familiarity.  Mr. Pole or Mr. Powl, probably in the spirit\nof prophecy, warned you against this danger.’\n\n‘Yes, Mr. Anne,’ said Rowley blankly.\n\n‘Now there has just arisen one of those rare cases, in which I am willing\nto depart from my principles.  My uncle has given me a box—what you would\ncall a Christmas box.  I don’t know what’s in it, and no more do you:\nperhaps I am an April fool, or perhaps I am already enormously wealthy;\nthere might be five hundred pounds in this apparently harmless\nreceptacle!’\n\n‘Lord, Mr. Anne!’ cried Rowley.\n\n‘Now, Rowley, hold up your right hand and repeat the words of the oath\nafter me,’ said I, laying the despatch-box on the table.  ‘Strike me blue\nif I ever disclose to Mr. Powl, or Mr. Powl’s Viscount, or anything that\nis Mr. Powl’s, not to mention Mr. Dawson and the doctor, the treasures of\nthe following despatch-box; and strike me sky-blue scarlet if I do not\ncontinually maintain, uphold, love, honour and obey, serve, and follow to\nthe four corners of the earth and the waters that are under the earth,\nthe hereinafter before-mentioned (only that I find I have neglected to\nmention him) Viscount Anne de Kéroual de St.-Yves, commonly known as Mr.\nRowley’s Viscount.  So be it.  Amen.’\n\nHe took the oath with the same exaggerated seriousness as I gave it to\nhim.\n\n‘Now,’ said I.  ‘Here is the key for you; I will hold the lid with both\nhands in the meanwhile.’  He turned the key.  ‘Bring up all the candles\nin the room, and range them along-side.  What is it to be?  A live\ngorgon, a Jack-in-the-box, or a spring that fires a pistol?  On your\nknees, sir, before the prodigy!’\n\nSo saying, I turned the despatch-box upside down upon the table.  At\nsight of the heap of bank paper and gold that lay in front of us, between\nthe candles, or rolled upon the floor alongside, I stood astonished.\n\n‘O Lord!’ cried Mr. Rowley; ‘oh Lordy, Lordy, Lord!’ and he scrambled\nafter the fallen guineas.  ‘O my, Mr. Anne! what a sight o’ money!  Why,\nit’s like a blessed story-book.  It’s like the Forty Thieves.’\n\n‘Now Rowley, let’s be cool, let’s be businesslike,’ said I.  ‘Riches are\ndeceitful, particularly when you haven’t counted them; and the first\nthing we have to do is to arrive at the amount of my—let me say, modest\ncompetency.  If I’m not mistaken, I have enough here to keep you in gold\nbuttons all the rest of your life.  You collect the gold, and I’ll take\nthe paper.’\n\nAccordingly, down we sat together on the hearthrug, and for some time\nthere was no sound but the creasing of bills and the jingling of guineas,\nbroken occasionally by the exulting exclamations of Rowley.  The\narithmetical operation on which we were embarked took long, and it might\nhave been tedious to others; not to me nor to my helper.\n\n‘Ten thousand pounds!’ I announced at last.\n\n‘Ten thousand!’ echoed Mr. Rowley.\n\nAnd we gazed upon each other.\n\nThe greatness of this fortune took my breath away.  With that sum in my\nhands, I need fear no enemies.  People are arrested, in nine cases out of\nten, not because the police are astute, but because they themselves run\nshort of money; and I had here before me in the despatch-box a succession\nof devices and disguises that insured my liberty.  Not only so; but, as I\nfelt with a sudden and overpowering thrill, with ten thousand pounds in\nmy hands I was become an eligible suitor.  What advances I had made in\nthe past, as a private soldier in a military prison, or a fugitive by the\nwayside, could only be qualified or, indeed, excused as acts of\ndesperation.  And now, I might come in by the front door; I might\napproach the dragon with a lawyer at my elbow, and rich settlements to\noffer.  The poor French prisoner, Champdivers, might be in a perpetual\ndanger of arrest; but the rich travelling Englishman, St.-Ives, in his\npost-chaise, with his despatch-box by his side, could smile at fate and\nlaugh at locksmiths.  I repeated the proverb, exulting, _Love laughs at\nlocksmiths_!  In a moment, by the mere coming of this money, my love had\nbecome possible—it had come near, it was under my hand—and it may be by\none of the curiosities of human nature, but it burned that instant\nbrighter.\n\n‘Rowley,’ said I, ‘your Viscount is a made man.’\n\n‘Why, we both are, sir,’ said Rowley.\n\n‘Yes, both,’ said I; ‘and you shall dance at the wedding;’ and I flung at\nhis head a bundle of bank notes, and had just followed it up with a\nhandful of guineas, when the door opened, and Mr. Romaine appeared upon\nthe threshold.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII—MR. ROMAINE CALLS ME NAMES\n\n\nFeeling very much of a fool to be thus taken by surprise, I scrambled to\nmy feet and hastened to make my visitor welcome.  He did not refuse me\nhis hand; but he gave it with a coldness and distance for which I was\nquite unprepared, and his countenance, as he looked on me, was marked in\na strong degree with concern and severity.\n\n‘So, sir, I find you here?’ said he, in tones of little encouragement.\n‘Is that you, George?  You can run away; I have business with your\nmaster.’\n\nHe showed Rowley out, and locked the door behind him.  Then he sat down\nin an armchair on one side of the fire, and looked at me with\nuncompromising sternness.\n\n‘I am hesitating how to begin,’ said he.  ‘In this singular labyrinth of\nblunders and difficulties that you have prepared for us, I am positively\nhesitating where to begin.  It will perhaps be best that you should read,\nfirst of all, this paragraph.’  And he handed over to me a newspaper.\n\nThe paragraph in question was brief.  It announced the recapture of one\nof the prisoners recently escaped from Edinburgh Castle; gave his name,\nClausel, and added that he had entered into the particulars of the recent\nrevolting murder in the Castle, and denounced the murderer:—\n\n    ‘It is a common soldier called Champdivers, who had himself escaped,\n    and is in all probability involved in the common fate of his\n    comrades.  In spite of the activity along all the Forth and the East\n    Coast, nothing has yet been seen of the sloop which these desperadoes\n    seized at Grangemouth, and it is now almost certain that they have\n    found a watery grave.’\n\nAt the reading of this paragraph, my heart turned over.  In a moment I\nsaw my castle in the air ruined; myself changed from a mere military\nfugitive into a hunted murderer, fleeing from the gallows; my love, which\nhad a moment since appeared so near to me, blotted from the field of\npossibility.  Despair, which was my first sentiment, did not, however,\nendure for more than a moment.  I saw that my companions had indeed\nsucceeded in their unlikely design; and that I was supposed to have\naccompanied and perished along with them by shipwreck—a most probable\nending to their enterprise.  If they thought me at the bottom of the\nNorth Sea, I need not fear much vigilance on the streets of Edinburgh.\nChampdivers was wanted: what was to connect him with St. Ives?  Major\nChevenix would recognise me if he met me; that was beyond bargaining: he\nhad seen me so often, his interest had been kindled to so high a point,\nthat I could hope to deceive him by no stratagem of disguise.  Well, even\nso; he would have a competition of testimony before him: he knew Clausel,\nhe knew me, and I was sure he would decide for honour.  At the same time\nthe image of Flora shot up in my mind’s eye with such a radiancy as\nfairly overwhelmed all other considerations; the blood sprang to every\ncorner of my body, and I vowed I would see and win her, if it cost my\nneck.\n\n‘Very annoying, no doubt,’ said I, as I returned the paper to Mr.\nRomaine.\n\n‘Is annoying your word for it?’ said he.\n\n‘Exasperating, if you like,’ I admitted.\n\n‘And true?’ he inquired.\n\n‘Well, true in a sense,’ said I.  ‘But perhaps I had better answer that\nquestion by putting you in possession of the facts?’\n\n‘I think so, indeed,’ said he.\n\nI narrated to him as much as seemed necessary of the quarrel, the duel,\nthe death of Goguelat, and the character of Clausel.  He heard me through\nin a forbidding silence, nor did he at all betray the nature of his\nsentiments, except that, at the episode of the scissors, I could observe\nhis mulberry face to turn three shades paler.\n\n‘I suppose I may believe you?’ said he, when I had done.\n\n‘Or else conclude this interview,’ said I.\n\n‘Can you not understand that we are here discussing matters of the\ngravest import?  Can you not understand that I feel myself weighed with a\nload of responsibility on your account—that you should take this occasion\nto air your fire-eating manners against your own attorney?  There are\nserious hours in life, Mr. Anne,’ he said severely.  ‘A capital charge,\nand that of a very brutal character and with singularly unpleasant\ndetails; the presence of the man Clausel, who (according to your account\nof it) is actuated by sentiments of real malignity, and prepared to swear\nblack white; all the other witnesses scattered and perhaps drowned at\nsea; the natural prejudice against a Frenchman and a runaway prisoner:\nthis makes a serious total for your lawyer to consider, and is by no\nmeans lessened by the incurable folly and levity of your own\ndisposition.’\n\n‘I beg your pardon!’ said I.\n\n‘Oh, my expressions have been selected with scrupulous accuracy,’ he\nreplied.  ‘How did I find you, sir, when I came to announce this\ncatastrophe?  You were sitting on the hearthrug playing, like a silly\nbaby, with a servant, were you not, and the floor all scattered with gold\nand bank paper?  There was a tableau for you!  It was I who came, and you\nwere lucky in that.  It might have been any one—your cousin as well as\nanother.’\n\n‘You have me there, sir,’ I admitted.  ‘I had neglected all precautions,\nand you do right to be angry.  _Apropos_, Mr. Romaine, how did you come\nyourself, and how long have you been in the house?’ I added, surprised,\non the retrospect, not to have heard him arrive.\n\n‘I drove up in a chaise and pair,’ he returned.  ‘Any one might have\nheard me.  But you were not listening, I suppose? being so extremely at\nyour ease in the very house of your enemy, and under a capital charge!\nAnd I have been long enough here to do your business for you.  Ah, yes, I\ndid it, God forgive me!—did it before I so much as asked you the\nexplanation of the paragraph.  For some time back the will has been\nprepared; now it is signed; and your uncle has heard nothing of your\nrecent piece of activity.  Why?  Well, I had no fancy to bother him on\nhis death-bed: you might be innocent; and at bottom I preferred the\nmurderer to the spy.’\n\nNo doubt of it but the man played a friendly part; no doubt also that, in\nhis ill-temper and anxiety, he expressed himself unpalatably.\n\n‘You will perhaps find me over delicate,’ said I.  ‘There is a word you\nemployed—’\n\n‘I employ the words of my brief, sir,’ he cried, striking with his hand\non the newspaper.  ‘It is there in six letters.  And do not be so\ncertain—you have not stood your trial yet.  It is an ugly affair, a fishy\nbusiness.  It is highly disagreeable.  I would give my hand off—I mean I\nwould give a hundred pound down, to have nothing to do with it.  And,\nsituated as we are, we must at once take action.  There is here no\nchoice.  You must at once quit this country, and get to France, or\nHolland, or, indeed, to Madagascar.’\n\n‘There may be two words to that,’ said I.\n\n‘Not so much as one syllable!’ he retorted.  ‘Here is no room for\nargument.  The case is nakedly plain.  In the disgusting position in\nwhich you have found means to place yourself, all that is to be hoped for\nis delay.  A time may come when we shall be able to do better.  It cannot\nbe now: now it would be the gibbet.’\n\n‘You labour under a false impression, Mr. Romaine,’ said I.  ‘I have no\nimpatience to figure in the dock.  I am even as anxious as yourself to\npostpone my first appearance there.  On the other hand, I have not the\nslightest intention of leaving this country, where I please myself\nextremely.  I have a good address, a ready tongue, an English accent that\npasses, and, thanks to the generosity of my uncle, as much money as I\nwant.  It would be hard indeed if, with all these advantages, Mr. St.\nIves should not be able to live quietly in a private lodging, while the\nauthorities amuse themselves by looking for Champdivers.  You forget,\nthere is no connection between these two personages.’\n\n‘And you forget your cousin,’ retorted Romaine.  ‘There is the link.\nThere is the tongue of the buckle.  He knows you are Champdivers.’  He\nput up his hand as if to listen.  ‘And, for a wager, here he is himself!’\nhe exclaimed.\n\nAs when a tailor takes a piece of goods upon his counter, and rends it\nacross, there came to our ears from the avenue the long tearing sound of\na chaise and four approaching at the top speed of the horses.  And,\nlooking out between the curtains, we beheld the lamps skimming on the\nsmooth ascent.\n\n‘Ay,’ said Romaine, wiping the window-pane that he might see more\nclearly.  ‘Ay, that is he by the driving!  So he squanders money along\nthe king’s highway, the triple idiot! gorging every man he meets with\ngold for the pleasure of arriving—where?  Ah, yes, where but a debtor’s\njail, if not a criminal prison!’\n\n‘Is he that kind of a man?’ I said, staring on these lamps as though I\ncould decipher in them the secret of my cousin’s character.\n\n‘You will find him a dangerous kind,’ answered the lawyer.  ‘For you,\nthese are the lights on a lee shore!  I find I fall in a muse when I\nconsider of him; what a formidable being he once was, and what a\npersonable! and how near he draws to the moment that must break him\nutterly! we none of us like him here; we hate him, rather; and yet I have\na sense—I don’t think at my time of life it can be pity—but a reluctance\nrather, to break anything so big and figurative, as though he were a big\nporcelain pot or a big picture of high price.  Ay, there is what I was\nwaiting for!’ he cried, as the lights of a second chaise swam in sight.\n‘It is he beyond a doubt.  The first was the signature and the next the\nflourish.  Two chaises, the second following with the baggage, which is\nalways copious and ponderous, and one of his valets: he cannot go a step\nwithout a valet.’\n\n‘I hear you repeat the word big,’ said I.  ‘But it cannot be that he is\nanything out of the way in stature.’\n\n‘No,’ said the attorney.  ‘About your height, as I guessed for the\ntailors, and I see nothing wrong with the result.  But, somehow, he\ncommands an atmosphere; he has a spacious manner; and he has kept up, all\nthrough life, such a volume of racket about his personality, with his\nchaises and his racers and his dicings, and I know not what—that somehow\nhe imposes!  It seems, when the farce is done, and he locked in Fleet\nprison—and nobody left but Buonaparte and Lord Wellington and the Hetman\nPlatoff to make a work about—the world will be in a comparison quite\ntranquil.  But this is beside the mark,’ he added, with an effort,\nturning again from the window.  ‘We are now under fire, Mr. Anne, as you\nsoldiers would say, and it is high time we should prepare to go into\naction.  He must not see you; that would be fatal.  All that he knows at\npresent is that you resemble him, and that is much more than enough.  If\nit were possible, it would be well he should not know you were in the\nhouse.’\n\n‘Quite impossible, depend upon it,’ said I.  ‘Some of the servants are\ndirectly in his interests, perhaps in his pay: Dawson, for an example.’\n\n‘My own idea!’ cried Romaine.  ‘And at least,’ he added, as the first of\nthe chaises drew up with a dash in front of the portico, ‘it is now too\nlate.  Here he is.’\n\nWe stood listening, with a strange anxiety, to the various noises that\nawoke in the silent house: the sound of doors opening and closing, the\nsound of feet near at hand and farther off.  It was plain the arrival of\nmy cousin was a matter of moment, almost of parade, to the household.\nAnd suddenly, out of this confused and distant bustle, a rapid and light\ntread became distinguishable.  We heard it come upstairs, draw near along\nthe corridor, pause at the door, and a stealthy and hasty rapping\nsucceeded.\n\n‘Mr. Anne—Mr. Anne, sir!  Let me in!’ said the voice of Rowley.\n\nWe admitted the lad, and locked the door again behind him.\n\n‘It’s _him_, sir,’ he panted.  ‘He’ve come.’\n\n‘You mean the Viscount?’ said I.  ‘So we supposed.  But come, Rowley—out\nwith the rest of it!  You have more to tell us, or your face belies you!’\n\n‘Mr. Anne, I do,’ he said.  ‘Mr. Romaine, sir, you’re a friend of his,\nain’t you?’\n\n‘Yes, George, I am a friend of his,’ said Romaine, and, to my great\nsurprise, laid his hand upon my shoulder.\n\n‘Well, it’s this way,’ said Rowley—‘Mr. Powl have been at me!  It’s to\nplay the spy!  I thought he was at it from the first!  From the first I\nsee what he was after—coming round and round, and hinting things!  But\nto-night he outs with it plump!  I’m to let him hear all what you’re to\ndo beforehand, he says; and he gave me this for an arnest’—holding up\nhalf a guinea; ‘and I took it, so I did!  Strike me sky-blue scarlet?’\nsays he, adducing the words of the mock oath; and he looked askance at me\nas he did so.\n\nI saw that he had forgotten himself, and that he knew it.  The expression\nof his eye changed almost in the passing of the glance from the\nsignificant to the appealing—from the look of an accomplice to that of a\nculprit; and from that moment he became the model of a well-drilled\nvalet.\n\n‘Sky-blue scarlet?’ repeated the lawyer.  ‘Is the fool delirious?’\n\n‘No,’ said I; ‘he is only reminding me of something.’\n\n‘Well—and I believe the fellow will be faithful,’ said Romaine.  ‘So you\nare a friend of Mr. Anne’s’ too?’ he added to Rowley.\n\n‘If you please, sir,’ said Rowley.\n\n‘’Tis something sudden,’ observed Romaine; ‘but it may be genuine enough.\nI believe him to be honest.  He comes of honest people.  Well, George\nRowley, you might embrace some early opportunity to earn that\nhalf-guinea, by telling Mr. Powl that your master will not leave here\ntill noon to-morrow, if he go even then.  Tell him there are a hundred\nthings to be done here, and a hundred more that can only be done properly\nat my office in Holborn.  Come to think of it—we had better see to that\nfirst of all,’ he went on, unlocking the door.  ‘Get hold of Powl, and\nsee.  And be quick back, and clear me up this mess.’\n\nMr. Rowley was no sooner gone than the lawyer took a pinch of snuff, and\nregarded me with somewhat of a more genial expression.\n\n‘Sir,’ said he, ‘it is very fortunate for you that your face is so strong\na letter of recommendation.  Here am I, a tough old practitioner, mixing\nmyself up with your very distressing business; and here is this farmer’s\nlad, who has the wit to take a bribe and the loyalty to come and tell you\nof it—all, I take it, on the strength of your appearance.  I wish I could\nimagine how it would impress a jury!’ says he.\n\n‘And how it would affect the hangman, sir?’ I asked\n\n‘_Absit omen_!’ said Mr. Romaine devoutly.\n\nWe were just so far in our talk, when I heard a sound that brought my\nheart into my mouth: the sound of some one slyly trying the handle of the\ndoor.  It had been preceded by no audible footstep.  Since the departure\nof Rowley our wing of the house had been entirely silent.  And we had\nevery right to suppose ourselves alone, and to conclude that the\nnew-comer, whoever he might be, was come on a clandestine, if not a\nhostile, errand.\n\n‘Who is there?’ asked Romaine.\n\n‘It’s only me, sir,’ said the soft voice of Dawson.  ‘It’s the Viscount,\nsir.  He is very desirous to speak with you on business.’\n\n‘Tell him I shall come shortly, Dawson,’ said the lawyer.  ‘I am at\npresent engaged.’\n\n‘Thank you, sir!’ said Dawson.\n\nAnd we heard his feet draw off slowly along the corridor.\n\n‘Yes,’ said Mr. Romaine, speaking low, and maintaining the attitude of\none intently listening, ‘there is another foot.  I cannot be deceived!’\n\n‘I think there was indeed!’ said I.  ‘And what troubles me—I am not sure\nthat the other has gone entirely away.  By the time it got the length of\nthe head of the stair the tread was plainly single.’\n\n‘Ahem—blockaded?’ asked the lawyer.\n\n‘A siege _en règle_!’ I exclaimed.\n\n‘Let us come farther from the door,’ said Romaine, ‘and reconsider this\ndamnable position.  Without doubt, Alain was this moment at the door.  He\nhoped to enter and get a view of you, as if by accident.  Baffled in\nthis, has he stayed himself, or has he planted Dawson here by way of\nsentinel?’\n\n‘Himself, beyond a doubt,’ said I.  ‘And yet to what end?  He cannot\nthink to pass the night there!’\n\n‘If it were only possible to pay no heed!’ said Mr. Romaine.  ‘But this\nis the accursed drawback of your position.  We can do nothing openly.  I\nmust smuggle you out of this room and out of this house like seizable\ngoods; and how am I to set about it with a sentinel planted at your very\ndoor?’\n\n‘There is no good in being agitated,’ said I.\n\n‘None at all,’ he acquiesced.  ‘And, come to think of it, it is droll\nenough that I should have been that very moment commenting on your\npersonal appearance, when your cousin came upon this mission.  I was\nsaying, if you remember, that your face was as good or better than a\nletter of recommendation.  I wonder if M. Alain would be like the rest of\nus—I wonder what he would think of it?’\n\nMr. Romaine was sitting in a chair by the fire with his back to the\nwindows, and I was myself kneeling on the hearthrug and beginning\nmechanically to pick up the scattered bills, when a honeyed voice joined\nsuddenly in our conversation.\n\n‘He thinks well of it, Mr. Romaine.  He begs to join himself to that\ncircle of admirers which you indicate to exist already.’\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX—THE DEVIL AND ALL AT AMERSHAM PLACE\n\n\nNever did two human creatures get to their feet with more alacrity than\nthe lawyer and myself.  We had locked and barred the main gates of the\ncitadel; but unhappily we had left open the bath-room sally-port; and\nhere we found the voice of the hostile trumpets sounding from within, and\nall our defences taken in reverse.  I took but the time to whisper Mr.\nRomaine in the ear: ‘Here is another tableau for you!’ at which he looked\nat me a moment with a kind of pathos, as who should say, ‘Don’t hit a man\nwhen he’s down.’  Then I transferred my eyes to my enemy.\n\nHe had his hat on, a little on one side: it was a very tall hat, raked\nextremely, and had a narrow curling brim.  His hair was all curled out in\nmasses like an Italian mountebank—a most unpardonable fashion.  He\nsported a huge tippeted overcoat of frieze, such as watchmen wear, only\nthe inside was lined with costly furs, and he kept it half open to\ndisplay the exquisite linen, the many-coloured waistcoat, and the profuse\njewellery of watch-chains and brooches underneath.  The leg and the ankle\nwere turned to a miracle.  It is out of the question that I should deny\nthe resemblance altogether, since it has been remarked by so many\ndifferent persons whom I cannot reasonably accuse of a conspiracy.  As a\nmatter of fact, I saw little of it and confessed to nothing.  Certainly\nhe was what some might call handsome, of a pictorial, exuberant style of\nbeauty, all attitude, profile, and impudence: a man whom I could see in\nfancy parade on the grand stand at a race-meeting or swagger in\nPiccadilly, staring down the women, and stared at himself with admiration\nby the coal-porters.  Of his frame of mind at that moment his face\noffered a lively if an unconscious picture.  He was lividly pale, and his\nlip was caught up in a smile that could almost be called a snarl, of a\nsheer, arid malignity that appalled me and yet put me on my mettle for\nthe encounter.  He looked me up and down, then bowed and took off his hat\nto me.\n\n‘My cousin, I presume?’ he said.\n\n‘I understand I have that honour,’ I replied.\n\n‘The honour is mine,’ said he, and his voice shook as he said it.\n\n‘I should make you welcome, I believe,’ said I.\n\n‘Why?’ he inquired.  ‘This poor house has been my home for longer than I\ncare to claim.  That you should already take upon yourself the duties of\nhost here is to be at unnecessary pains.  Believe me, that part would be\nmore becomingly mine.  And, by the way, I must not fail to offer you my\nlittle compliment.  It is a gratifying surprise to meet you in the dress\nof a gentleman, and to see’—with a circular look upon the scattered\nbills—‘that your necessities have already been so liberally relieved.’\n\nI bowed with a smile that was perhaps no less hateful than his own.\n\n‘There are so many necessities in this world,’ said I.  ‘Charity has to\nchoose.  One gets relieved, and some other, no less indigent, perhaps\nindebted, must go wanting.’\n\n‘Malice is an engaging trait,’ said he.\n\n‘And envy, I think?’ was my reply.\n\nHe must have felt that he was not getting wholly the better of this\npassage at arms; perhaps even feared that he should lose command of his\ntemper, which he reined in throughout the interview as with a red-hot\ncurb, for he flung away from me at the word, and addressed the lawyer\nwith insulting arrogance.\n\n‘Mr. Romaine,’ he said, ‘since when have you presumed to give orders in\nthis house?’\n\n‘I am not prepared to admit that I have given any,’ replied Romaine;\n‘certainly none that did not fall in the sphere of my responsibilities.’\n\n‘By whose orders, then, am I denied entrance to my uncle’s room?’ said my\ncousin.\n\n‘By the doctor’s, sir,’ replied Romaine; ‘and I think even you will admit\nhis faculty to give them.’\n\n‘Have a care, sir,’ cried Alain.  ‘Do not be puffed up with your\nposition.  It is none so secure, Master Attorney.  I should not wonder in\nthe least if you were struck off the rolls for this night’s work, and the\nnext I should see of you were when I flung you alms at a pothouse door to\nmend your ragged elbows.  The doctor’s orders?  But I believe I am not\nmistaken!  You have to-night transacted business with the Count; and this\nneedy young gentleman has enjoyed the privilege of still another\ninterview, in which (as I am pleased to see) his dignity has not\nprevented his doing very well for himself.  I wonder that you should care\nto prevaricate with me so idly.’\n\n‘I will confess so much,’ said Mr. Romaine, ‘if you call it\nprevarication.  The order in question emanated from the Count himself.\nHe does not wish to see you.’\n\n‘For which I must take the word of Mr. Daniel Romaine?’ asked Alain.\n\n‘In default of any better,’ said Romaine.\n\nThere was an instantaneous convulsion in my cousin’s face, and I\ndistinctly heard him gnash his teeth at this reply; but, to my surprise,\nhe resumed in tones of almost good humour:\n\n‘Come, Mr. Romaine, do not let us be petty!’  He drew in a chair and sat\ndown.  ‘Understand you have stolen a march upon me.  You have introduced\nyour soldier of Napoleon, and (how, I cannot conceive) he has been\napparently accepted with favour.  I ask no better proof than the funds\nwith which I find him literally surrounded—I presume in consequence of\nsome extravagance of joy at the first sight of so much money.  The odds\nare so far in your favour, but the match is not yet won.  Questions will\narise of undue influence, of sequestration, and the like: I have my\nwitnesses ready.  I tell it you cynically, for you cannot profit by the\nknowledge; and, if the worst come to the worst, I have good hopes of\nrecovering my own and of ruining you.’\n\n‘You do what you please,’ answered Romaine; ‘but I give it you for a\npiece of good advice, you had best do nothing in the matter.  You will\nonly make yourself ridiculous; you will only squander money, of which you\nhave none too much, and reap public mortification.’\n\n‘Ah, but there you make the common mistake, Mr. Romaine!’ returned Alain.\n‘You despise your adversary.  Consider, if you please, how very\ndisagreeable I could make myself, if I chose.  Consider the position of\nyour _protégé_—an escaped prisoner!  But I play a great game.  I condemn\nsuch petty opportunities.’\n\nAt this Romaine and I exchanged a glance of triumph.  It seemed manifest\nthat Alain had as yet received no word of Clausel’s recapture and\ndenunciation.  At the same moment the lawyer, thus relieved of the\ninstancy of his fear, changed his tactics.  With a great air of\nunconcern, he secured the newspaper, which still lay open before him on\nthe table.\n\n‘I think, Monsieur Alain, that you labour under some illusion,’ said he.\n‘Believe me, this is all beside the mark.  You seem to be pointing to\nsome compromise.  Nothing is further from my views.  You suspect me of an\ninclination to trifle with you, to conceal how things are going.  I\ncannot, on the other hand, be too early or too explicit in giving you\ninformation which concerns you (I must say) capitally.  Your great-uncle\nhas to-night cancelled his will, and made a new one in favour of your\ncousin Anne.  Nay, and you shall hear it from his own lips, if you\nchoose!  I will take so much upon me,’ said the lawyer, rising.  ‘Follow\nme, if you please, gentlemen.’\n\nMr. Romaine led the way out of the room so briskly, and was so briskly\nfollowed by Alain, that I had hard ado to get the remainder of the money\nreplaced and the despatch-box locked, and to overtake them, even by\nrunning ere they should be lost in that maze of corridors, my uncle’s\nhouse.  As it was, I went with a heart divided; and the thought of my\ntreasure thus left unprotected, save by a paltry lid and lock that any\none might break or pick open, put me in a perspiration whenever I had the\ntime to remember it.  The lawyer brought us to a room, begged us to be\nseated while he should hold a consultation with the doctor, and, slipping\nout of another door, left Alain and myself closeted together.\n\nTruly he had done nothing to ingratiate himself; his every word had been\nsteeped in unfriendliness, envy, and that contempt which (as it is born\nof anger) it is possible to support without humiliation.  On my part, I\nhad been little more conciliating; and yet I began to be sorry for this\nman, hired spy as I knew him to be.  It seemed to me less than decent\nthat he should have been brought up in the expectation of this great\ninheritance, and now, at the eleventh hour, be tumbled forth out of the\nhouse door and left to himself, his poverty and his debts—those debts of\nwhich I had so ungallantly reminded him so short a time before.  And we\nwere scarce left alone ere I made haste to hang out a flag of truce.\n\n‘My cousin,’ said I, ‘trust me, you will not find me inclined to be your\nenemy.’\n\nHe paused in front of me—for he had not accepted the lawyer’s invitation\nto be seated, but walked to and fro in the apartment—took a pinch of\nsnuff, and looked at me while he was taking it with an air of much\ncuriosity.\n\n‘Is it even so?’ said he.  ‘Am I so far favoured by fortune as to have\nyour pity?  Infinitely obliged, my cousin Anne!  But these sentiments are\nnot always reciprocal, and I warn you that the day when I set my foot on\nyour neck, the spine shall break.  Are you acquainted with the properties\nof the spine?’ he asked with an insolence beyond qualification.\n\nIt was too much.  ‘I am acquainted also with the properties of a pair of\npistols,’ said I, toising him.\n\n‘No, no, no!’ says he, holding up his finger.  ‘I will take my revenge\nhow and when I please.  We are enough of the same family to understand\neach other, perhaps; and the reason why I have not had you arrested on\nyour arrival, why I had not a picket of soldiers in the first clump of\nevergreens, to await and prevent your coming—I, who knew all, before whom\nthat pettifogger, Romaine, has been conspiring in broad daylight to\nsupplant me—is simply this: that I had not made up my mind how I was to\ntake my revenge.’\n\nAt that moment he was interrupted by the tolling of a bell.  As we stood\nsurprised and listening, it was succeeded by the sound of many feet\ntrooping up the stairs and shuffling by the door of our room.  Both, I\nbelieve, had a great curiosity to set it open, which each, owing to the\npresence of the other, resisted; and we waited instead in silence, and\nwithout moving, until Romaine returned and bade us to my uncle’s\npresence.\n\nHe led the way by a little crooked passage, which brought us out in the\nsick-room, and behind the bed.  I believe I have forgotten to remark that\nthe Count’s chamber was of considerable dimensions.  We beheld it now\ncrowded with the servants and dependants of the house, from the doctor\nand the priest to Mr. Dawson and the housekeeper, from Dawson down to\nRowley and the last footman in white calves, the last plump chambermaid\nin her clean gown and cap, and the last ostler in a stable waiscoat.\nThis large congregation of persons (and I was surprised to see how large\nit was) had the appearance, for the most part, of being ill at ease and\nheartily bewildered, standing on one foot, gaping like zanies, and those\nwho were in the corners nudging each other and grinning aside.  My uncle,\non the other hand, who was raised higher than I had yet seen him on his\npillows, wore an air of really imposing gravity.  No sooner had we\nappeared behind him, than he lifted his voice to a good loudness, and\naddressed the assemblage.\n\n‘I take you all to witness—can you hear me?—I take you all to witness\nthat I recognise as my heir and representative this gentleman, whom most\nof you see for the first time, the Viscount Anne de St.-Yves, my nephew\nof the younger line.  And I take you to witness at the same time that,\nfor very good reasons known to myself, I have discarded and disinherited\nthis other gentleman whom you all know, the Viscount de St.-Yves.  I have\nalso to explain the unusual trouble to which I have put you all—and,\nsince your supper was not over, I fear I may even say annoyance.  It has\npleased M. Alain to make some threats of disputing my will, and to\npretend that there are among your number certain estimable persons who\nmay be trusted to swear as he shall direct them.  It pleases me thus to\nput it out of his power and to stop the mouths of his false witnesses.  I\nam infinitely obliged by your politeness, and I have the honour to wish\nyou all a very good evening.’\n\nAs the servants, still greatly mystified, crowded out of the sickroom\ndoor, curtseying, pulling the forelock, scraping with the foot, and so\non, according to their degree, I turned and stole a look at my cousin.\nHe had borne this crushing public rebuke without change of countenance.\nHe stood, now, very upright, with folded arms, and looking inscrutably at\nthe roof of the apartment.  I could not refuse him at that moment the\ntribute of my admiration.  Still more so when, the last of the domestics\nhaving filed through the doorway and left us alone with my great-uncle\nand the lawyer, he took one step forward towards the bed, made a\ndignified reverence, and addressed the man who had just condemned him to\nruin.\n\n‘My lord,’ said he, ‘you are pleased to treat me in a manner which my\ngratitude, and your state, equally forbid me to call in question.  It\nwill be only necessary for me to call your attention to the length of\ntime in which I have been taught to regard myself as your heir.  In that\nposition, I judged it only loyal to permit myself a certain scale of\nexpenditure.  If I am now to be cut off with a shilling as the reward of\ntwenty years of service, I shall be left not only a beggar, but a\nbankrupt.’\n\nWhether from the fatigue of his recent exertion, or by a well-inspired\ningenuity of hate, my uncle had once more closed his eyes; nor did he\nopen them now.  ‘Not with a shilling,’ he contented himself with\nreplying; and there stole, as he said it, a sort of smile over his face,\nthat flickered there conspicuously for the least moment of time, and then\nfaded and left behind the old impenetrable mask of years, cunning, and\nfatigue.  There could be no mistake: my uncle enjoyed the situation as he\nhad enjoyed few things in the last quarter of a century.  The fires of\nlife scarce survived in that frail body; but hatred, like some immortal\nquality, was still erect and unabated.\n\nNevertheless my cousin persevered.\n\n‘I speak at a disadvantage,’ he resumed.  ‘My supplanter, with perhaps\nmore wisdom than delicacy, remains in the room,’ and he cast a glance at\nme that might have withered an oak tree.\n\nI was only too willing to withdraw, and Romaine showed as much alacrity\nto make way for my departure.  But my uncle was not to be moved.  In the\nsame breath of a voice, and still without opening his eyes, he bade me\nremain.\n\n‘It is well,’ said Alain.  ‘I cannot then go on to remind you of the\ntwenty years that have passed over our heads in England, and the services\nI may have rendered you in that time.  It would be a position too odious.\nYour lordship knows me too well to suppose I could stoop to such\nignominy.  I must leave out all my defence—your lordship wills it so!  I\ndo not know what are my faults; I know only my punishment, and it is\ngreater than I have the courage to face.  My uncle, I implore your pity:\npardon me so far; do not send me for life into a debtors’ jail—a pauper\ndebtor.’\n\n‘_Chat et vieux_, _pardonnez_?’ said my uncle, quoting from La Fontaine;\nand then, opening a pale-blue eye full on Alain, he delivered with some\nemphasis:\n\n    ‘La jeunesse se flatte et croit tout obtenir;\n    La vieillesse est impitoyable.’\n\nThe blood leaped darkly into Alain’s face.  He turned to Romaine and me,\nand his eyes flashed.\n\n‘It is your turn now,’ he said.  ‘At least it shall be prison for prison\nwith the two viscounts.’\n\n‘Not so, Mr. Alain, by your leave,’ said Romaine.  ‘There are a few\nformalities to be considered first.’\n\nBut Alain was already striding towards the door.\n\n‘Stop a moment, stop a moment!’ cried Romaine.  ‘Remember your own\ncounsel not to despise an adversary.’\n\nAlain turned.\n\n‘If I do not despise I hate you!’ he cried, giving a loose to his\npassion.  ‘Be warned of that, both of you.’\n\n‘I understand you to threaten Monsieur le Vicomte Anne,’ said the lawyer.\n‘Do you know, I would not do that.  I am afraid, I am very much afraid,\nif you were to do as you propose, you might drive me into extremes.’\n\n‘You have made me a beggar and a bankrupt,’ said Alain.  What extreme is\nleft?’\n\n‘I scarce like to put a name upon it in this company,’ replied Romaine.\n‘But there are worse things than even bankruptcy, and worse places than a\ndebtors’ jail.’\n\nThe words were so significantly said that there went a visible thrill\nthrough Alain; sudden as a sword-stroke, he fell pale again.\n\n‘I do not understand you,’ said he.\n\n‘O yes, you do,’ returned Romaine.  ‘I believe you understand me very\nwell.  You must not suppose that all this time, while you were so very\nbusy, others were entirely idle.  You must not fancy, because I am an\nEnglishman, that I have not the intelligence to pursue an inquiry.  Great\nas is my regard for the honour of your house, M. Alain de St.-Yves, if I\nhear of you moving directly or indirectly in this matter, I shall do my\nduty, let it cost what it will: that is, I shall communicate the real\nname of the Buonapartist spy who signs his letters _Rue Grégoire de\nTours_.’\n\nI confess my heart was already almost altogether on the side of my\ninsulted and unhappy cousin; and if it had not been before, it must have\nbeen so now, so horrid was the shock with which he heard his infamy\nexposed.  Speech was denied him; he carried his hand to his neckcloth; he\nstaggered; I thought he must have fallen.  I ran to help him, and at that\nhe revived, recoiled before me, and stood there with arms stretched forth\nas if to preserve himself from the outrage of my touch.\n\n‘Hands off!’ he somehow managed to articulate.\n\n‘You will now, I hope,’ pursued the lawyer, without any change of voice,\n‘understand the position in which you are placed, and how delicately it\nbehoves you to conduct yourself.  Your arrest hangs, if I may so express\nmyself, by a hair; and as you will be under the perpetual vigilance of\nmyself and my agents, you must look to it narrowly that you walk\nstraight.  Upon the least dubiety, I will take action.’  He snuffed,\nlooking critically at the tortured man.  ‘And now let me remind you that\nyour chaise is at the door.  This interview is agitating to his\nlordship—it cannot be agreeable for you—and I suggest that it need not be\nfurther drawn out.  It does not enter into the views of your uncle, the\nCount, that you should again sleep under this roof.’\n\nAs Alain turned and passed without a word or a sign from the apartment, I\ninstantly followed.  I suppose I must be at bottom possessed of some\nhumanity; at least, this accumulated torture, this slow butchery of a man\nas by quarters of rock, had wholly changed my sympathies.  At that moment\nI loathed both my uncle and the lawyer for their coldblooded cruelty.\n\nLeaning over the banisters, I was but in time to hear his hasty footsteps\nin that hall that had been crowded with servants to honour his coming,\nand was now left empty against his friendless departure.  A moment later,\nand the echoes rang, and the air whistled in my ears, as he slammed the\ndoor on his departing footsteps.  The fury of the concussion gave me (had\none been still wanted) a measure of the turmoil of his passions.  In a\nsense, I felt with him; I felt how he would have gloried to slam that\ndoor on my uncle, the lawyer, myself, and the whole crowd of those who\nhad been witnesses to his humiliation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX—AFTER THE STORM\n\n\nNo sooner was the house clear of my cousin than I began to reckon up,\nruefully enough, the probable results of what had passed.  Here were a\nnumber of pots broken, and it looked to me as if I should have to pay for\nall!  Here had been this proud, mad beast goaded and baited both publicly\nand privately, till he could neither hear nor see nor reason; whereupon\nthe gate had been set open, and he had been left free to go and contrive\nwhatever vengeance he might find possible.  I could not help thinking it\nwas a pity that, whenever I myself was inclined to be upon my good\nbehaviour, some friends of mine should always determine to play a piece\nof heroics and cast me for the hero—or the victim—which is very much the\nsame.  The first duty of heroics is to be of your own choosing.  When\nthey are not that, they are nothing.  And I assure you, as I walked back\nto my own room, I was in no very complaisant humour: thought my uncle and\nMr. Romaine to have played knuckle-bones with my life and prospects;\ncursed them for it roundly; had no wish more urgent than to avoid the\npair of them; and was quite knocked out of time, as they say in the ring,\nto find myself confronted with the lawyer.\n\nHe stood on my hearthrug, leaning on the chimney-piece, with a gloomy,\nthoughtful brow, as I was pleased to see, and not in the least as though\nhe were vain of the late proceedings.\n\n‘Well?’ said I.  ‘You have done it now!’\n\n‘Is he gone?’ he asked.\n\n‘He is gone,’ said I.  ‘We shall have the devil to pay with him when he\ncomes back.’\n\n‘You are right,’ said the lawyer, ‘and very little to pay him with but\nflams and fabrications, like to-night’s.’\n\n‘To-night’s?’ I repeated.\n\n‘Ay, to-night’s!’ said he.\n\n‘To-night’s _what_?’ I cried.\n\n‘To-night’s flams and fabrications.’\n\n‘God be good to me, sir,’ said I, ‘have I something more to admire in\nyour conduct than ever _I_ had suspected?  You cannot think how you\ninterest me!  That it was severe, I knew; I had already chuckled over\nthat.  But that it should be false also!  In what sense, dear sir?’\n\nI believe I was extremely offensive as I put the question, but the lawyer\npaid no heed.\n\n‘False in all senses of the word,’ he replied seriously.  ‘False in the\nsense that they were not true, and false in the sense that they were not\nreal; false in the sense that I boasted, and in the sense that I lied.\nHow can I arrest him?  Your uncle burned the papers!  I told you so—but\ndoubtless you have forgotten—the day I first saw you in Edinburgh Castle.\nIt was an act of generosity; I have seen many of these acts, and always\nregretted—always regretted!  “That shall be his inheritance,” he said, as\nthe papers burned; he did not mean that it should have proved so rich a\none.  How rich, time will tell.’\n\n‘I beg your pardon a hundred thousand times, my dear sir, but it strikes\nme you have the impudence—in the circumstances, I may call it the\nindecency—to appear cast down?’\n\n‘It is true,’ said he: ‘I am.  I am cast down.  I am literally cast down.\nI feel myself quite helpless against your cousin.’\n\n‘Now, really!’ I asked.  ‘Is this serious?  And is it perhaps the reason\nwhy you have gorged the poor devil with every species of insult? and why\nyou took such surprising pains to supply me with what I had so little\nneed of—another enemy?  That you were helpless against them?  “Here is my\nlast missile,” say you; “my ammunition is quite exhausted: just wait till\nI get the last in—it will irritate, it cannot hurt him.  There—you\nsee!—he is furious now, and I am quite helpless.  One more prod, another\nkick: now he is a mere lunatic!  Stand behind me; I am quite helpless!”\nMr. Romaine, I am asking myself as to the background or motive of this\nsingular jest, and whether the name of it should not be called\ntreachery?’\n\n‘I can scarce wonder,’ said he.  ‘In truth it has been a singular\nbusiness, and we are very fortunate to be out of it so well.  Yet it was\nnot treachery: no, no, Mr. Anne, it was not treachery; and if you will do\nme the favour to listen to me for the inside of a minute, I shall\ndemonstrate the same to you beyond cavil.’  He seemed to wake up to his\nordinary briskness.  ‘You see the point?’ he began.  ‘He had not yet read\nthe newspaper, but who could tell when he might?  He might have had that\ndamned journal in his pocket, and how should we know?  We were—I may say,\nwe are—at the mercy of the merest twopenny accident.’\n\n‘Why, true,’ said I: ‘I had not thought of that.’\n\n‘I warrant you,’ cried Romaine, ‘you had supposed it was nothing to be\nthe hero of an interesting notice in the journals!  You had supposed, as\nlike as not, it was a form of secrecy!  But not so in the least.  A part\nof England is already buzzing with the name of Champdivers; a day or two\nmore and the mail will have carried it everywhere: so wonderful a machine\nis this of ours for disseminating intelligence!  Think of it!  When my\nfather was born—but that is another story.  To return: we had here the\nelements of such a combustion as I dread to think of—your cousin and the\njournal.  Let him but glance an eye upon that column of print, and where\nwere we?  It is easy to ask; not so easy to answer, my young friend.  And\nlet me tell you, this sheet is the Viscount’s usual reading.  It is my\nconviction he had it in his pocket.’\n\n‘I beg your pardon, sir,’ said I.  ‘I have been unjust.  I did not\nappreciate my danger.’\n\n‘I think you never do,’ said he.\n\n‘But yet surely that public scene—’ I began.\n\n‘It was madness.  I quite agree with you,’ Mr. Romaine interrupted.  ‘But\nit was your uncle’s orders, Mr. Anne, and what could I do?  Tell him you\nwere the murderer of Goguelat?  I think not.’\n\n‘No, sure!’ said I.  ‘That would but have been to make the trouble\nthicker.  We were certainly in a very ill posture.’\n\n‘You do not yet appreciate how grave it was,’ he replied.  ‘It was\nnecessary for you that your cousin should go, and go at once.  You\nyourself had to leave to-night under cover of darkness, and how could you\nhave done that with the Viscount in the next room?  He must go, then; he\nmust leave without delay.  And that was the difficulty.’\n\n‘Pardon me, Mr. Romaine, but could not my uncle have bidden him go?’ I\nasked.\n\n‘Why, I see I must tell you that this is not so simple as it sounds,’ he\nreplied.  ‘You say this is your uncle’s house, and so it is.  But to all\neffects and purposes it is your cousin’s also.  He has rooms here; has\nhad them coming on for thirty years now, and they are filled with a\nprodigious accumulation of trash—stays, I dare say, and powder-puffs, and\nsuch effeminate idiocy—to which none could dispute his title, even\nsuppose any one wanted to.  We had a perfect right to bid him go, and he\nhad a perfect right to reply, “Yes, I will go, but not without my stays\nand cravats.  I must first get together the nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine\nchestsfull of insufferable rubbish, that I have spent the last thirty\nyears collecting—and may very well spend the next thirty hours a-packing\nof.”  And what should we have said to that?’\n\n‘By way of repartee?’ I asked.  ‘Two tall footmen and a pair of crabtree\ncudgels, I suggest.’\n\n‘The Lord deliver me from the wisdom of laymen!’ cried Romaine.  ‘Put\nmyself in the wrong at the beginning of a lawsuit?  No, indeed!  There\nwas but one thing to do, and I did it, and burned my last cartridge in\nthe doing of it.  I stunned him.  And it gave us three hours, by which we\nshould make haste to profit; for if there is one thing sure, it is that\nhe will be up to time again to-morrow in the morning.’\n\n‘Well,’ said I, ‘I own myself an idiot.  Well do they say, _an old\nsoldier_, _an old innocent_!  For I guessed nothing of all this.’\n\n‘And, guessing it, have you the same objections to leave England?’ he\ninquired.\n\n‘The same,’ said I.\n\n‘It is indispensable,’ he objected.\n\n‘And it cannot be,’ I replied.  ‘Reason has nothing to say in the matter;\nand I must not let you squander any of yours.  It will be enough to tell\nyou this is an affair of the heart.’\n\n‘Is it even so?’ quoth Romaine, nodding his head.  ‘And I might have been\nsure of it.  Place them in a hospital, put them in a jail in yellow\noveralls, do what you will, young Jessamy finds young Jenny.  O, have it\nyour own way; I am too old a hand to argue with young gentlemen who\nchoose to fancy themselves in love; I have too much experience, thank\nyou.  Only, be sure that you appreciate what you risk: the prison, the\ndock, the gallows, and the halter—terribly vulgar circumstances, my young\nfriend; grim, sordid, earnest; no poetry in that!’\n\n‘And there I am warned,’ I returned gaily.  ‘No man could be warned more\nfinely or with a greater eloquence.  And I am of the same opinion still.\nUntil I have again seen that lady, nothing shall induce me to quit Great\nBritain.  I have besides—’\n\nAnd here I came to a full stop.  It was upon my tongue to have told him\nthe story of the drovers, but at the first word of it my voice died in my\nthroat.  There might be a limit to the lawyer’s toleration, I reflected.\nI had not been so long in Britain altogether; for the most part of that\ntime I had been by the heels in limbo in Edinburgh Castle; and already I\nhad confessed to killing one man with a pair of scissors; and now I was\nto go on and plead guilty to having settled another with a holly stick!\nA wave of discretion went over me as cold and as deep as the sea.\n\n‘In short, sir, this is a matter of feeling,’ I concluded, ‘and nothing\nwill prevent my going to Edinburgh.’\n\nIf I had fired a pistol in his ear he could not have been more startled.\n\n‘To Edinburgh?’ he repeated.  ‘Edinburgh? where the very paving-stones\nknow you!’\n\n‘Then is the murder out!’ said I.  ‘But, Mr. Romaine, is there not\nsometimes safety in boldness?  Is it not a common-place of strategy to\nget where the enemy least expects you?  And where would he expect me\nless?’\n\n‘Faith, there is something in that, too!’ cried the lawyer.  ‘Ay,\ncertainly, a great deal in that.  All the witnesses drowned but one, and\nhe safe in prison; you yourself changed beyond recognition—let us\nhope—and walking the streets of the very town you have illustrated by\nyour—well, your eccentricity!  It is not badly combined, indeed!’\n\n‘You approve it, then?’ said I.\n\n‘O, approve!’ said he; ‘there is no question of approval.  There is only\none course which I could approve, and that were to escape to France\ninstanter.’\n\n‘You do not wholly disapprove, at least?’ I substituted.\n\n‘Not wholly; and it would not matter if I did,’ he replied.  ‘Go your own\nway; you are beyond argument.  And I am not sure that you will run more\ndanger by that course than by any other.  Give the servants time to get\nto bed and fall asleep, then take a country cross-road and walk, as the\nrhyme has it, like blazes all night.  In the morning take a chaise or\ntake the mail at pleasure, and continue your journey with all the decorum\nand reserve of which you shall be found capable.’\n\n‘I am taking the picture in,’ I said.  ‘Give me time.  ’Tis the _tout\nensemble_ I must see: the whole as opposed to the details.’\n\n‘Mountebank!’ he murmured.\n\n‘Yes, I have it now; and I see myself with a servant, and that servant is\nRowley,’ said I.\n\n‘So as to have one more link with your uncle?’ suggested the lawyer.\n‘Very judicious!’\n\n‘And, pardon me, but that is what it is,’ I exclaimed.  ‘Judicious is the\nword.  I am not making a deception fit to last for thirty years; I do not\nfound a palace in the living granite for the night.  This is a shelter\ntent—a flying picture—seen, admired, and gone again in the wink of an\neye.  What is wanted, in short, is a _trompe-l’œil_ that shall be good\nenough for twelve hours at an inn: is it not so?’\n\n‘It is, and the objection holds.  Rowley is but another danger,’ said\nRomaine.\n\n‘Rowley,’ said I, ‘will pass as a servant from a distance—as a creature\nseen poised on the dicky of a bowling chaise.  He will pass at hand as a\nsmart, civil fellow one meets in the inn corridor, and looks back at, and\nasks, and is told, “Gentleman’s servant in Number 4.”  He will pass, in\nfact, all round, except with his personal friends!  My dear sir, pray\nwhat do you expect?  Of course if we meet my cousin, or if we meet\nanybody who took part in the judicious exhibition of this evening, we are\nlost; and who’s denying it?  To every disguise, however good and safe,\nthere is always the weak point; you must always take (let us say—and to\ntake a simile from your own waistcoat pocket) a snuff box-full of risk.\nYou’ll get it just as small with Rowley as with anybody else.  And the\nlong and short of it is, the lad’s honest, he likes me, I trust him; he\nis my servant, or nobody.’\n\n‘He might not accept,’ said Romaine.\n\n‘I bet you a thousand pounds he does!’ cried I.  ‘But no matter; all you\nhave to do is to send him out to-night on this cross-country business,\nand leave the thing to me.  I tell you, he will be my servant, and I tell\nyou, he will do well.’\n\nI had crossed the room, and was already overhauling my wardrobe as I\nspoke.\n\n‘Well,’ concluded the lawyer, with a shrug, ‘one risk with another: _à la\nguerre comme à la guerre_, as you would say.  Let the brat come and be\nuseful, at least.’  And he was about to ring the bell, when his eye was\ncaught by my researches in the wardrobe.  ‘Do not fall in love with these\ncoats, waistcoats, cravats, and other panoply and accoutrements by which\nyou are now surrounded.  You must not run the post as a dandy.  It is not\nthe fashion, even.’\n\n‘You are pleased to be facetious, sir,’ said I; ‘and not according to\nknowledge.  These clothes are my life, they are my disguise; and since I\ncan take but few of them, I were a fool indeed if I selected hastily!\nWill you understand, once and for all, what I am seeking?  To be\ninvisible, is the first point; the second, to be invisible in a\npost-chaise and with a servant.  Can you not perceive the delicacy of the\nquest?  Nothing must be too coarse, nothing too fine; _rien de voyant_,\n_rien qui détonne_; so that I may leave everywhere the inconspicuous\nimage of a handsome young man of a good fortune travelling in proper\nstyle, whom the landlord will forget in twelve hours—and the chambermaid\nperhaps remember, God bless her! with a sigh.  This is the very fine art\nof dress.’\n\n‘I have practised it with success for fifty years,’ said Romaine, with a\nchuckle.  ‘A black suit and a clean shirt is my infallible recipe.’\n\n‘You surprise me; I did not think you would be shallow!’ said I,\nlingering between two coats.  ‘Pray, Mr. Romaine, have I your head? or\ndid you travel post and with a smartish servant?’\n\n‘Neither, I admit,’ said he.\n\n‘Which change the whole problem,’ I continued.  ‘I have to dress for a\nsmartish servant and a Russia leather despatch-box.’  That brought me to\na stand.  I came over and looked at the box with a moment’s hesitation.\n‘Yes,’ I resumed.  ‘Yes, and for the despatch-box!  It looks moneyed and\nlanded; it means I have a lawyer.  It is an invaluable property.  But I\ncould have wished it to hold less money.  The responsibility is crushing.\nShould I not do more wisely to take five hundred pounds, and intrust the\nremainder with you, Mr. Romaine?’\n\n‘If you are sure you will not want it,’ answered Romaine.\n\n‘I am far from sure of that,’ cried I.  ‘In the first place, as a\nphilosopher.  This is the first time I have been at the head of a large\nsum, and it is conceivable—who knows himself?—that I may make it fly.  In\nthe second place, as a fugitive.  Who knows what I may need?  The whole\nof it may be inadequate.  But I can always write for more.’\n\n‘You do not understand,’ he replied.  ‘I break off all communication with\nyou here and now.  You must give me a power of attorney ere you start\nto-night, and then be done with me trenchantly until better days.’\n\nI believe I offered some objection.\n\n‘Think a little for once of me!’ said Romaine.  ‘I must not have seen you\nbefore to-night.  To-night we are to have had our only interview, and you\nare to have given me the power; and to-night I am to have lost sight of\nyou again—I know not whither, you were upon business, it was none of my\naffairs to question you!  And this, you are to remark, in the interests\nof your own safety much more than mine.’\n\n‘I am not even to write to you?’ I said, a little bewildered.\n\n‘I believe I am cutting the last strand that connects you with common\nsense,’ he replied.  ‘But that is the plain English of it.  You are not\neven to write; and if you did, I would not answer.’\n\n‘A letter, however—’ I began.\n\n‘Listen to me,’ interrupted Romaine.  ‘So soon as your cousin reads the\nparagraph, what will he do?  Put the police upon looking into my\ncorrespondence!  So soon as you write to me, in short, you write to Bow\nStreet; and if you will take my advice, you will date that letter from\nFrance.’\n\n‘The devil!’ said I, for I began suddenly to see that this might put me\nout of the way of my business.\n\n‘What is it now?’ says he.\n\n‘There will be more to be done, then, before we can part,’ I answered.\n\n‘I give you the whole night,’ said he.  ‘So long as you are off ere\ndaybreak, I am content.’\n\n‘In short, Mr. Romaine,’ said I, ‘I have had so much benefit of your\nadvice and services that I am loth to sever the connection, and would\neven ask a substitute.  I would be obliged for a letter of introduction\nto one of your own cloth in Edinburgh—an old man for choice, very\nexperienced, very respectable, and very secret.  Could you favour me with\nsuch a letter?’\n\n‘Why, no,’ said he.  ‘Certainly not.  I will do no such thing, indeed.’\n\n‘It would be a great favour, sir,’ I pleaded.\n\n‘It would be an unpardonable blunder,’ he replied.  ‘What?  Give you a\nletter of introduction? and when the police come, I suppose, I must\nforget the circumstance?  No, indeed.  Talk of it no more.’\n\n‘You seem to be always in the right,’ said I.  ‘The letter would be out\nof the question, I quite see that.  But the lawyer’s name might very well\nhave dropped from you in the way of conversation; having heard him\nmentioned, I might profit by the circumstance to introduce myself; and in\nthis way my business would be the better done, and you not in the least\ncompromised.’\n\n‘What is this business?’ said Romaine.\n\n‘I have not said that I had any,’ I replied.  ‘It might arise.  This is\nonly a possibility that I must keep in view.’\n\n‘Well,’ said he, with a gesture of the hands, ‘I mention Mr. Robbie; and\nlet that be an end of it!—Or wait!’ he added, ‘I have it.  Here is\nsomething that will serve you for an introduction, and cannot compromise\nme.’  And he wrote his name and the Edinburgh lawyer’s address on a piece\nof card and tossed it to me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI—I BECOME THE OWNER OF A CLARET-COLOURED CHAISE\n\n\nWhat with packing, signing papers, and partaking of an excellent cold\nsupper in the lawyer’s room, it was past two in the morning before we\nwere ready for the road.  Romaine himself let us out of a window in a\npart of the house known to Rowley: it appears it served as a kind of\npostern to the servants’ hall, by which (when they were in the mind for a\nclandestine evening) they would come regularly in and out; and I remember\nvery well the vinegar aspect of the lawyer on the receipt of this piece\nof information—how he pursed his lips, jutted his eyebrows, and kept\nrepeating, ‘This must be seen to, indeed! this shall be barred to-morrow\nin the morning!’  In this preoccupation, I believe he took leave of me\nwithout observing it; our things were handed out; we heard the window\nshut behind us; and became instantly lost in a horrid intricacy of\nblackness and the shadow of woods.\n\nA little wet snow kept sleepily falling, pausing, and falling again; it\nseemed perpetually beginning to snow and perpetually leaving off; and the\ndarkness was intense.  Time and again we walked into trees; time and\nagain found ourselves adrift among garden borders or stuck like a ram in\nthe thicket.  Rowley had possessed himself of the matches, and he was\nneither to be terrified nor softened.  ‘No, I will not, Mr. Anne, sir,’\nhe would reply.  ‘You know he tell me to wait till we were over the ’ill.\nIt’s only a little way now.  Why, and I thought you was a soldier, too!’\nI was at least a very glad soldier when my valet consented at last to\nkindle a thieves’ match.  From this, we easily lit the lantern; and\nthenceforward, through a labyrinth of woodland paths, were conducted by\nits uneasy glimmer.  Both booted and great-coated, with tall hats much of\na shape, and laden with booty in the form of a despatch-box, a case of\npistols, and two plump valises, I thought we had very much the look of a\npair of brothers returning from the sack of Amersham Place.\n\nWe issued at last upon a country by-road where we might walk abreast and\nwithout precaution.  It was nine miles to Aylesbury, our immediate\ndestination; by a watch, which formed part of my new outfit, it should be\nabout half-past three in the morning; and as we did not choose to arrive\nbefore daylight, time could not be said to press.  I gave the order to\nmarch at ease.\n\n‘Now, Rowley,’ said I, ‘so far so good.  You have come, in the most\nobliging manner in the world, to carry these valises.  The question is,\nwhat next?  What are we to do at Aylesbury? or, more particularly, what\nare you?  Thence, I go on a journey.  Are you to accompany me?’\n\nHe gave a little chuckle.  ‘That’s all settled already, Mr. Anne, sir,’\nhe replied.  ‘Why, I’ve got my things here in the valise—a half a dozen\nshirts and what not; I’m all ready, sir: just you lead on: _you’ll_ see.’\n\n‘The devil you have!’ said I.  ‘You made pretty sure of your welcome.’\n\n‘If you please, sir,’ said Rowley.\n\nHe looked up at me, in the light of the lantern, with a boyish shyness\nand triumph that awoke my conscience.  I could never let this innocent\ninvolve himself in the perils and difficulties that beset my course,\nwithout some hint of warning, which it was a matter of extreme delicacy\nto make plain enough and not too plain.\n\n‘No, no,’ said I; ‘you may think you have made a choice, but it was\nblindfold, and you must make it over again.  The Count’s service is a\ngood one; what are you leaving it for?  Are you not throwing away the\nsubstance for the shadow?  No, do not answer me yet.  You imagine that I\nam a prosperous nobleman, just declared my uncle’s heir, on the threshold\nof the best of good fortune, and, from the point of view of a judicious\nservant, a jewel of a master to serve and stick to?  Well, my boy, I am\nnothing of the kind, nothing of the kind.’\n\nAs I said the words, I came to a full stop and held up the lantern to his\nface.  He stood before me, brilliantly illuminated on the background of\nimpenetrable night and falling snow, stricken to stone between his double\nburden like an ass between two panniers, and gaping at me like a\nblunderbuss.  I had never seen a face so predestined to be astonished, or\nso susceptible of rendering the emotion of surprise; and it tempted me as\nan open piano tempts the musician.\n\n‘Nothing of the sort, Rowley,’ I continued, in a churchyard voice.\n‘These are appearances, petty appearances.  I am in peril, homeless,\nhunted.  I count scarce any one in England who is not my enemy.  From\nthis hour I drop my name, my title; I become nameless; my name is\nproscribed.  My liberty, my life, hang by a hair.  The destiny which you\nwill accept, if you go forth with me, is to be tracked by spies, to hide\nyourself under a false name, to follow the desperate pretences and\nperhaps share the fate of a murderer with a price upon his head.’\n\nHis face had been hitherto beyond expectation, passing from one depth to\nanother of tragic astonishment, and really worth paying to see; but at\nthis it suddenly cleared.  ‘Oh, I ain’t afraid!’ he said; and then,\nchoking into laughter, ‘why, I see it from the first!’\n\nI could have beaten him.  But I had so grossly overshot the mark that I\nsuppose it took me two good miles of road and half an hour of elocution\nto persuade him I had been in earnest.  In the course of which I became\nso interested in demonstrating my present danger that I forgot all about\nmy future safety, and not only told him the story of Goguelat, but threw\nin the business of the drovers as well, and ended by blurting out that I\nwas a soldier of Napoleon’s and a prisoner of war.\n\nThis was far from my views when I began; and it is a common complaint of\nme that I have a long tongue.  I believe it is a fault beloved by\nfortune.  Which of you considerate fellows would have done a thing at\nonce so foolhardy and so wise as to make a confidant of a boy in his\nteens, and positively smelling of the nursery?  And when had I cause to\nrepent it?  There is none so apt as a boy to be the adviser of any man in\ndifficulties such as mine.  To the beginnings of virile common sense he\nadds the last lights of the child’s imagination; and he can fling himself\ninto business with that superior earnestness that properly belongs to\nplay.  And Rowley was a boy made to my hand.  He had a high sense of\nromance, and a secret cultus for all soldiers and criminals.  His\ntravelling library consisted of a chap-book life of Wallace and some\nsixpenny parts of the ‘Old Bailey Sessions Papers’ by Gurney the\nshorthand writer; and the choice depicts his character to a hair.  You\ncan imagine how his new prospects brightened on a boy of this\ndisposition.  To be the servant and companion of a fugitive, a soldier,\nand a murderer, rolled in one—to live by stratagems, disguises, and false\nnames, in an atmosphere of midnight and mystery so thick that you could\ncut it with a knife—was really, I believe, more dear to him than his\nmeals, though he was a great trencherman, and something of a glutton\nbesides.  For myself, as the peg by which all this romantic business\nhung, I was simply idolised from that moment; and he would rather have\nsacrificed his hand than surrendered the privilege of serving me.\n\nWe arranged the terms of our campaign, trudging amicably in the snow,\nwhich now, with the approach of morning, began to fall to purpose.  I\nchose the name of Ramornie, I imagine from its likeness to Romaine;\nRowley, from an irresistible conversion of ideas, I dubbed Gammon.  His\ndistress was laughable to witness: his own choice of an unassuming\nnickname had been Claude Duval!  We settled our procedure at the various\ninns where we should alight, rehearsed our little manners like a piece of\ndrill until it seemed impossible we should ever be taken unprepared; and\nin all these dispositions, you maybe sure the despatch-box was not\nforgotten.  Who was to pick it up, who was to set it down, who was to\nremain beside it, who was to sleep with it—there was no contingency\nomitted, all was gone into with the thoroughness of a drill-sergeant on\nthe one hand and a child with a new plaything on the other.\n\n‘I say, wouldn’t it look queer if you and me was to come to the\npost-house with all this luggage?’ said Rowley.\n\n‘I dare say,’ I replied.  ‘But what else is to be done?’\n\n‘Well, now, sir—you hear me,’ says Rowley.  ‘I think it would look more\nnatural-like if you was to come to the post-house alone, and with nothing\nin your ’ands—more like a gentleman, you know.  And you might say that\nyour servant and baggage was a-waiting for you up the road.  I think I\ncould manage, somehow, to make a shift with all them dratted\nthings—leastways if you was to give me a ’and up with them at the start.’\n\n‘And I would see you far enough before I allowed you to try, Mr. Rowley!’\nI cried.  ‘Why, you would be quite defenceless!  A footpad that was an\ninfant child could rob you.  And I should probably come driving by to\nfind you in a ditch with your throat cut.  But there is something in your\nidea, for all that; and I propose we put it in execution no farther\nforward than the next corner of a lane.’\n\nAccordingly, instead of continuing to aim for Aylesbury, we headed by\ncross-roads for some point to the northward of it, whither I might assist\nRowley with the baggage, and where I might leave him to await my return\nin the post-chaise.\n\nIt was snowing to purpose, the country all white, and ourselves walking\nsnowdrifts, when the first glimmer of the morning showed us an inn upon\nthe highwayside.  Some distance off, under the shelter of a corner of the\nroad and a clump of trees, I loaded Rowley with the whole of our\npossessions, and watched him till he staggered in safety into the doors\nof the _Green Dragon_, which was the sign of the house.  Thence I walked\nbriskly into Aylesbury, rejoicing in my freedom and the causeless good\nspirits that belong to a snowy morning; though, to be sure, long before I\nhad arrived the snow had again ceased to fall, and the eaves of Aylesbury\nwere smoking in the level sun.  There was an accumulation of gigs and\nchaises in the yard, and a great bustle going forward in the coffee-room\nand about the doors of the inn.  At these evidences of so much travel on\nthe road I was seized with a misgiving lest it should be impossible to\nget horses, and I should be detained in the precarious neighbourhood of\nmy cousin.  Hungry as I was, I made my way first of all to the\npostmaster, where he stood—a big, athletic, horsey-looking man, blowing\ninto a key in the corner of the yard.\n\nOn my making my modest request, he awoke from his indifference into what\nseemed passion.\n\n‘A po’-shay and ’osses!’ he cried.  ‘Do I look as if I ’ad a po’-shay and\n’osses?  Damn me, if I ’ave such a thing on the premises.  I don’t _make_\n’osses and chaises—I ’_ire_ ’em.  You might be God Almighty!’ said he;\nand instantly, as if he had observed me for the first time, he broke off,\nand lowered his voice into the confidential.  ‘Why, now that I see you\nare a gentleman,’ said he, ‘I’ll tell you what!  If you like to _buy_, I\nhave the article to fit you.  Second-’and shay by Lycett, of London.\nLatest style; good as new.  Superior fittin’s, net on the roof, baggage\nplatform, pistol ’olsters—the most com-plete and the most gen-teel\nturn-out I ever see!  The ’ole for seventy-five pound!  It’s as good as\ngivin’ her away!’\n\n‘Do you propose I should trundle it myself, like a hawker’s barrow?’ said\nI.  ‘Why, my good man, if I had to stop here, anyway, I should prefer to\nbuy a house and garden!’\n\n‘Come and look at her!’ he cried; and, with the word, links his arm in\nmine and carries me to the outhouse where the chaise was on view.\n\nIt was just the sort of chaise that I had dreamed of for my purpose:\neminently rich, inconspicuous, and genteel; for, though I thought the\npostmaster no great authority, I was bound to agree with him so far.  The\nbody was painted a dark claret, and the wheels an invisible green.  The\nlamp and glasses were bright as silver; and the whole equipage had an air\nof privacy and reserve that seemed to repel inquiry and disarm suspicion.\nWith a servant like Rowley, and a chaise like this, I felt that I could\ngo from the Land’s End to John o’ Groat’s House amid a population of\nbowing ostlers.  And I suppose I betrayed in my manner the degree in\nwhich the bargain tempted me.\n\n‘Come,’ cried the postmaster—‘I’ll make it seventy, to oblige a friend!’\n\n‘The point is: the horses,’ said I.\n\n‘Well,’ said he, consulting his watch, ‘it’s now gone the ’alf after\neight.  What time do you want her at the door?’\n\n‘Horses and all?’ said I.\n\n‘’Osses and all!’ says he.  ‘One good turn deserves another.  You give me\nseventy pound for the shay, and I’ll ’oss it for you.  I told you I\ndidn’t _make_ ’osses; but I _can_ make ’em, to oblige a friend.’\n\nWhat would you have?  It was not the wisest thing in the world to buy a\nchaise within a dozen miles of my uncle’s house; but in this way I got my\nhorses for the next stage.  And by any other it appeared that I should\nhave to wait.  Accordingly I paid the money down—perhaps twenty pounds\ntoo much, though it was certainly a well-made and well-appointed\nvehicle—ordered it round in half an hour, and proceeded to refresh myself\nwith breakfast.\n\nThe table to which I sat down occupied the recess of a bay-window, and\ncommanded a view of the front of the inn, where I continued to be amused\nby the successive departures of travellers—the fussy and the offhand, the\nniggardly and the lavish—all exhibiting their different characters in\nthat diagnostic moment of the farewell: some escorted to the stirrup or\nthe chaise door by the chamberlain, the chambermaids and the waiters\nalmost in a body, others moving off under a cloud, without human\ncountenance.  In the course of this I became interested in one for whom\nthis ovation began to assume the proportions of a triumph; not only the\nunder-servants, but the barmaid, the landlady, and my friend the\npostmaster himself, crowding about the steps to speed his departure.  I\nwas aware, at the same time, of a good deal of merriment, as though the\ntraveller were a man of a ready wit, and not too dignified to air it in\nthat society.  I leaned forward with a lively curiosity; and the next\nmoment I had blotted myself behind the teapot.  The popular traveller had\nturned to wave a farewell; and behold! he was no other than my cousin\nAlain.  It was a change of the sharpest from the angry, pallid man I had\nseen at Amersham Place.  Ruddy to a fault, illuminated with vintages,\ncrowned with his curls like Bacchus, he now stood before me for an\ninstant, the perfect master of himself, smiling with airs of conscious\npopularity and insufferable condescension.  He reminded me at once of a\nroyal duke, or an actor turned a little elderly, and of a blatant bagman\nwho should have been the illegitimate son of a gentleman.  A moment after\nhe was gliding noiselessly on the road to London.\n\nI breathed again.  I recognised, with heartfelt gratitude, how lucky I\nhad been to go in by the stable-yard instead of the hostelry door, and\nwhat a fine occasion of meeting my cousin I had lost by the purchase of\nthe claret-coloured chaise!  The next moment I remembered that there was\na waiter present.  No doubt but he must have observed me when I crouched\nbehind the breakfast equipage; no doubt but he must have commented on\nthis unusual and undignified behaviour; and it was essential that I\nshould do something to remove the impression.\n\n‘Waiter!’ said I, ‘that was the nephew of Count Carwell that just drove\noff, wasn’t it?’\n\n‘Yes, sir: Viscount Carwell we calls him,’ he replied.\n\n‘Ah, I thought as much,’ said I.  ‘Well, well, damn all these Frenchmen,\nsay I!’\n\n‘You may say so indeed, sir,’ said the waiter.  ‘They ain’t not to say in\nthe same field with our ’ome-raised gentry.’\n\n‘Nasty tempers?’ I suggested.\n\n‘Beas’ly temper, sir, the Viscount ’ave,’ said the waiter with feeling.\n‘Why, no longer agone than this morning, he was sitting breakfasting and\nreading in his paper.  I suppose, sir, he come on some pilitical\ninformation, or it might be about ’orses, but he raps his ’and upon the\ntable sudden and calls for curacoa.  It gave me quite a turn, it did; he\ndid it that sudden and ’ard.  Now, sir, that may be manners in France,\nbut hall I can say is, that I’m not used to it.’\n\n‘Reading the paper, was he?’ said I.  ‘What paper, eh?’\n\n‘Here it is, sir,’ exclaimed the waiter.  ‘Seems like as if he’d dropped\nit.’\n\nAnd picking it off the floor he presented it to me.\n\nI may say that I was quite prepared, that I already knew what to expect;\nbut at sight of the cold print my heart stopped beating.  There it was:\nthe fulfilment of Romaine’s apprehension was before me; the paper was\nlaid open at the capture of Clausel.  I felt as if I could take a little\ncuracoa myself, but on second thoughts called for brandy.  It was badly\nwanted; and suddenly I observed the waiter’s eye to sparkle, as it were,\nwith some recognition; made certain he had remarked the resemblance\nbetween me and Alain; and became aware—as by a revelation—of the fool’s\npart I had been playing.  For I had now managed to put my identification\nbeyond a doubt, if Alain should choose to make his inquiries at\nAylesbury; and, as if that were not enough, I had added, at an expense of\nseventy pounds, a clue by which he might follow me through the length and\nbreadth of England, in the shape of the claret-coloured chaise!  That\nelegant equipage (which I began to regard as little better than a\nclaret-coloured ante-room to the hangman’s cart) coming presently to the\ndoor, I left my breakfast in the middle and departed; posting to the\nnorth as diligently as my cousin Alain was posting to the south, and\nputting my trust (such as it was) in an opposite direction and equal\nspeed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII—CHARACTER AND ACQUIREMENTS OF MR.  ROWLEY\n\n\nI am not certain that I had ever really appreciated before that hour the\nextreme peril of the adventure on which I was embarked.  The sight of my\ncousin, the look of his face—so handsome, so jovial at the first sight,\nand branded with so much malignity as you saw it on the second—with his\nhyperbolical curls in order, with his neckcloth tied as if for the\nconquests of love, setting forth (as I had no doubt in the world he was\ndoing) to clap the Bow Street runners on my trail, and cover England with\nhandbills, each dangerous as a loaded musket, convinced me for the first\ntime that the affair was no less serious than death.  I believe it came\nto a near touch whether I should not turn the horses’ heads at the next\nstage and make directly for the coast.  But I was now in the position of\na man who should have thrown his gage into the den of lions; or, better\nstill, like one who should have quarrelled overnight under the influence\nof wine, and now, at daylight, in a cold winter’s morning, and humbly\nsober, must make good his words.  It is not that I thought any the less,\nor any the less warmly, of Flora.  But, as I smoked a grim segar that\nmorning in a corner of the chaise, no doubt I considered, in the first\nplace, that the letter-post had been invented, and admitted privately to\nmyself, in the second, that it would have been highly possible to write\nher on a piece of paper, seal it, and send it skimming by the mail,\ninstead of going personally into these egregious dangers, and through a\ncountry that I beheld crowded with gibbets and Bow Street officers.  As\nfor Sim and Candlish, I doubt if they crossed my mind.\n\nAt the Green Dragon Rowley was waiting on the doorsteps with the luggage,\nand really was bursting with unpalatable conversation.\n\n‘Who do you think we’ve ’ad ’ere, sir?’ he began breathlessly, as the\nchaise drove off.  ‘Red Breasts’; and he nodded his head portentously.\n\n‘Red Breasts?’ I repeated, for I stupidly did not understand at the\nmoment an expression I had often heard.\n\n‘Ah!’ said he.  ‘Red weskits.  Runners.  Bow Street runners.  Two on’ em,\nand one was Lavender himself!  I hear the other say quite plain, “Now,\nMr. Lavender, _if_ you’re ready.”  They was breakfasting as nigh me as I\nam to that postboy.  They’re all right; they ain’t after us.  It’s a\nforger; and I didn’t send them off on a false scent—O no!  I thought\nthere was no use in having them over our way; so I give them “very\nvaluable information,” Mr. Lavender said, and tipped me a tizzy for\nmyself; and they’re off to Luton.  They showed me the ’andcuffs, too—the\nother one did—and he clicked the dratted things on my wrist; and I tell\nyou, I believe I nearly went off in a swound!  There’s something so\nbeastly in the feel of them!  Begging your pardon, Mr. Anne,’ he added,\nwith one of his delicious changes from the character of the confidential\nschoolboy into that of the trained, respectful servant.\n\nWell, I must not be proud!  I cannot say I found the subject of handcuffs\nto my fancy; and it was with more asperity than was needful that I\nreproved him for the slip about the name.\n\n‘Yes, Mr. Ramornie,’ says he, touching his hat.  ‘Begging your pardon,\nMr. Ramornie.  But I’ve been very piticular, sir, up to now; and you may\ntrust me to be very piticular in the future.  It were only a slip, sir.’\n\n‘My good boy,’ said I, with the most imposing severity, ‘there must be no\nslips.  Be so good as to remember that my life is at stake.’\n\nI did not embrace the occasion of telling him how many I had made myself.\nIt is my principle that an officer must never be wrong.  I have seen two\ndivisions beating their brains out for a fortnight against a worthless\nand quite impregnable castle in a pass: I knew we were only doing it for\ndiscipline, because the General had said so at first, and had not yet\nfound any way out of his own words; and I highly admired his force of\ncharacter, and throughout these operations thought my life exposed in a\nvery good cause.  With fools and children, which included Rowley, the\nnecessity was even greater.  I proposed to myself to be infallible; and\neven when he expressed some wonder at the purchase of the claret-coloured\nchaise, I put him promptly in his place.  In our situation, I told him,\neverything had to be sacrificed to appearances; doubtless, in a hired\nchaise, we should have had more freedom, but look at the dignity!  I was\nso positive, that I had sometimes almost convinced myself.  Not for long,\nyou may be certain!  This detestable conveyance always appeared to me to\nbe laden with Bow Street officers, and to have a placard upon the back of\nit publishing my name and crimes.  If I had paid seventy pounds to get\nthe thing, I should not have stuck at seven hundred to be safely rid of\nit.\n\nAnd if the chaise was a danger, what an anxiety was the despatch-box and\nits golden cargo!  I had never had a care but to draw my pay and spend\nit; I had lived happily in the regiment, as in my father’s house, fed by\nthe great Emperor’s commissariat as by ubiquitous doves of Elijah—or, my\nfaith! if anything went wrong with the commissariat, helping myself with\nthe best grace in the world from the next peasant!  And now I began to\nfeel at the same time the burthen of riches and the fear of destitution.\nThere were ten thousand pounds in the despatch-box, but I reckoned in\nFrench money, and had two hundred and fifty thousand agonies; I kept it\nunder my hand all day, I dreamed of it at night.  In the inns, I was\nafraid to go to dinner and afraid to go to sleep.  When I walked up a\nhill I durst not leave the doors of the claret-coloured chaise.\nSometimes I would change the disposition of the funds: there were days\nwhen I carried as much as five or six thousand pounds on my own person,\nand only the residue continued to voyage in the treasure-chest—days when\nI bulked all over like my cousin, crackled to a touch with bank paper,\nand had my pockets weighed to bursting-point with sovereigns.  And there\nwere other days when I wearied of the thing—or grew ashamed of it—and put\nall the money back where it had come from: there let it take its chance,\nlike better people!  In short, I set Rowley a poor example of\nconsistency, and in philosophy, none at all.\n\nLittle he cared!  All was one to him so long as he was amused, and I\nnever knew any one amused more easily.  He was thrillingly interested in\nlife, travel, and his own melodramatic position.  All day he would be\nlooking from the chaise windows with ebullitions of gratified curiosity,\nthat were sometimes justified and sometimes not, and that (taken\naltogether) it occasionally wearied me to be obliged to share.  I can\nlook at horses, and I can look at trees too, although not fond of it.\nBut why should I look at a lame horse, or a tree that was like the letter\nY?  What exhilaration could I feel in viewing a cottage that was the same\ncolour as ‘the second from the miller’s’ in some place where I had never\nbeen, and of which I had not previously heard?  I am ashamed to complain,\nbut there were moments when my juvenile and confidential friend weighed\nheavy on my hands.  His cackle was indeed almost continuous, but it was\nnever unamiable.  He showed an amiable curiosity when he was asking\nquestions; an amiable guilelessness when he was conferring information.\nAnd both he did largely.  I am in a position to write the biographies of\nMr. Rowley, Mr. Rowley’s father and mother, his Aunt Eliza, and the\nmiller’s dog; and nothing but pity for the reader, and some misgivings as\nto the law of copyright, prevail on me to withhold them.\n\nA general design to mould himself upon my example became early apparent,\nand I had not the heart to check it.  He began to mimic my carriage; he\nacquired, with servile accuracy, a little manner I had of shrugging the\nshoulders; and I may say it was by observing it in him that I first\ndiscovered it in myself.  One day it came out by chance that I was of the\nCatholic religion.  He became plunged in thought, at which I was gently\nglad.  Then suddenly—\n\n‘Odd-rabbit it!  I’ll be Catholic too!’ he broke out.  ‘You must teach me\nit, Mr. Anne—I mean, Ramornie.’\n\nI dissuaded him: alleging that he would find me very imperfectly informed\nas to the grounds and doctrines of the Church, and that, after all, in\nthe matter of religions, it was a very poor idea to change.  ‘Of course,\nmy Church is the best,’ said I; ‘but that is not the reason why I belong\nto it: I belong to it because it was the faith of my house.  I wish to\ntake my chances with my own people, and so should you.  If it is a\nquestion of going to hell, go to hell like a gentleman with your\nancestors.’\n\n‘Well, it wasn’t that,’ he admitted.  ‘I don’t know that I was exactly\nthinking of hell.  Then there’s the inquisition, too.  That’s rather a\ncawker, you know.’\n\n‘And I don’t believe you were thinking of anything in the world,’ said\nI—which put a period to his respectable conversion.\n\nHe consoled himself by playing for awhile on a cheap flageolet, which was\none of his diversions, and to which I owed many intervals of peace.  When\nhe first produced it, in the joints, from his pocket, he had the\nduplicity to ask me if I played upon it.  I answered, no; and he put the\ninstrument away with a sigh and the remark that he had thought I might.\nFor some while he resisted the unspeakable temptation, his fingers\nvisibly itching and twittering about his pocket, even his interest in the\nlandscape and in sporadic anecdote entirely lost.  Presently the pipe was\nin his hands again; he fitted, unfitted, refitted, and played upon it in\ndumb show for some time.\n\n‘I play it myself a little,’ says he.\n\n‘Do you?’ said I, and yawned.\n\nAnd then he broke down.\n\n‘Mr. Ramornie, if you please, would it disturb you, sir, if I was to play\na chune?’ he pleaded.  And from that hour, the tootling of the flageolet\ncheered our way.\n\nHe was particularly keen on the details of battles, single combats,\nincidents of scouting parties, and the like.  These he would make haste\nto cap with some of the exploits of Wallace, the only hero with whom he\nhad the least acquaintance.  His enthusiasm was genuine and pretty.  When\nhe learned we were going to Scotland, ‘Well, then,’ he broke out, ‘I’ll\nsee where Wallace lived!’  And presently after, he fell to moralising.\n‘It’s a strange thing, sir,’ he began, ‘that I seem somehow to have\nalways the wrong sow by the ear.  I’m English after all, and I glory in\nit.  My eye! don’t I, though!  Let some of your Frenchies come over here\nto invade, and you’ll see whether or not!  Oh, yes, I’m English to the\nbackbone, I am.  And yet look at me!  I got hold of this ’ere William\nWallace and took to him right off; I never heard of such a man before!\nAnd then you came along, and I took to you.  And both the two of you were\nmy born enemies!  I—I beg your pardon, Mr. Ramornie, but would you mind\nit very much if you didn’t go for to do anything against England’—he\nbrought the word out suddenly, like something hot—‘when I was along of\nyou?’\n\nI was more affected than I can tell.\n\n‘Rowley,’ I said, ‘you need have no fear.  By how much I love my own\nhonour, by so much I will take care to protect yours.  We are but\nfraternising at the outposts, as soldiers do.  When the bugle calls, my\nboy, we must face each other, one for England, one for France, and may\nGod defend the right!’\n\nSo I spoke at the moment; but for all my brave airs, the boy had wounded\nme in a vital quarter.  His words continued to ring in my hearing.  There\nwas no remission all day of my remorseful thoughts; and that night (which\nwe lay at Lichfield, I believe) there was no sleep for me in my bed.  I\nput out the candle and lay down with a good resolution; and in a moment\nall was light about me like a theatre, and I saw myself upon the stage of\nit playing ignoble parts.  I remembered France and my Emperor, now\ndepending on the arbitrament of war, bent down, fighting on their knees\nand with their teeth against so many and such various assailants.  And I\nburned with shame to be here in England, cherishing an English fortune,\npursuing an English mistress, and not there, to handle a musket in my\nnative fields, and to manure them with my body if I fell.  I remembered\nthat I belonged to France.  All my fathers had fought for her, and some\nhad died; the voice in my throat, the sight of my eyes, the tears that\nnow sprang there, the whole man of me, was fashioned of French earth and\nborn of a French mother; I had been tended and caressed by a succession\nof the daughters of France, the fairest, the most ill-starred; and I had\nfought and conquered shoulder to shoulder with her sons.  A soldier, a\nnoble, of the proudest and bravest race in Europe, it had been left to\nthe prattle of a hobbledehoy lackey in an English chaise to recall me to\nthe consciousness of duty.\n\nWhen I saw how it was I did not lose time in indecision.  The old\nclassical conflict of love and honour being once fairly before me, it did\nnot cost me a thought.  I was a Saint-Yves de Kéroual; and I decided to\nstrike off on the morrow for Wakefield and Burchell Fenn, and embark, as\nsoon as it should be morally possible, for the succour of my downtrodden\nfatherland and my beleaguered Emperor.  Pursuant on this resolve, I\nleaped from bed, made a light, and as the watchman was crying half-past\ntwo in the dark streets of Lichfield, sat down to pen a letter of\nfarewell to Flora.  And then—whether it was the sudden chill of the\nnight, whether it came by association of ideas from the remembrance of\nSwanston Cottage I know not, but there appeared before me—to the barking\nof sheep-dogs—a couple of snuffy and shambling figures, each wrapped in a\nplaid, each armed with a rude staff; and I was immediately bowed down to\nhave forgotten them so long, and of late to have thought of them so\ncavalierly.\n\nSure enough there was my errand!  As a private person I was neither\nFrench nor English; I was something else first: a loyal gentleman, an\nhonest man.  Sim and Candlish must not be left to pay the penalty of my\nunfortunate blow.  They held my honour tacitly pledged to succour them;\nand it is a sort of stoical refinement entirely foreign to my nature to\nset the political obligation above the personal and private.  If France\nfell in the interval for the lack of Anne de St.-Yves, fall she must!\nBut I was both surprised and humiliated to have had so plain a duty bound\nupon me for so long—and for so long to have neglected and forgotten it.\nI think any brave man will understand me when I say that I went to bed\nand to sleep with a conscience very much relieved, and woke again in the\nmorning with a light heart.  The very danger of the enterprise reassured\nme: to save Sim and Candlish (suppose the worst to come to the worst) it\nwould be necessary for me to declare myself in a court of justice, with\nconsequences which I did not dare to dwell upon; it could never be said\nthat I had chosen the cheap and the easy—only that in a very perplexing\ncompetition of duties I had risked my life for the most immediate.\n\nWe resumed the journey with more diligence: thenceforward posted day and\nnight; did not halt beyond what was necessary for meals; and the\npostillions were excited by gratuities, after the habit of my cousin\nAlain.  For twopence I could have gone farther and taken four horses; so\nextreme was my haste, running as I was before the terrors of an awakened\nconscience.  But I feared to be conspicuous.  Even as it was, we\nattracted only too much attention, with our pair and that white elephant,\nthe seventy-pounds-worth of claret-coloured chaise.\n\nMeanwhile I was ashamed to look Rowley in the face.  The young shaver had\ncontrived to put me wholly in the wrong; he had cost me a night’s rest\nand a severe and healthful humiliation; and I was grateful and\nembarrassed in his society.  This would never do; it was contrary to all\nmy ideas of discipline; if the officer has to blush before the private,\nor the master before the servant, nothing is left to hope for but\ndischarge or death.  I hit upon the idea of teaching him French; and\naccordingly, from Lichfield, I became the distracted master, and he the\nscholar—how shall I say? indefatigable, but uninspired.  His interest\nnever flagged.  He would hear the same word twenty times with profound\nrefreshment, mispronounce it in several different ways, and forget it\nagain with magical celerity.  Say it happened to be _stirrup_.  ‘No, I\ndon’t seem to remember that word, Mr. Anne,’ he would say: ‘it don’t seem\nto stick to me, that word don’t.’  And then, when I had told it him\nagain, ‘_Etrier_!’ he would cry.  ‘To be sure!  I had it on the tip of my\ntongue.  _Eterier_!’ (going wrong already, as if by a fatal instinct).\n‘What will I remember it by, now?  Why, _interior_, to be sure!  I’ll\nremember it by its being something that ain’t in the interior of a\nhorse.’  And when next I had occasion to ask him the French for stirrup,\nit was a toss-up whether he had forgotten all about it, or gave me\n_exterior_ for an answer.  He was never a hair discouraged.  He seemed to\nconsider that he was covering the ground at a normal rate.  He came up\nsmiling day after day.  ‘Now, sir, shall we do our French?’ he would say;\nand I would put questions, and elicit copious commentary and explanation,\nbut never the shadow of an answer.  My hands fell to my sides; I could\nhave wept to hear him.  When I reflected that he had as yet learned\nnothing, and what a vast deal more there was for him to learn, the period\nof these lessons seemed to unroll before me vast as eternity, and I saw\nmyself a teacher of a hundred, and Rowley a pupil of ninety, still\nhammering on the rudiments!  The wretched boy, I should say, was quite\nunspoiled by the inevitable familiarities of the journey.  He turned out\nat each stage the pink of serving-lads, deft, civil, prompt, attentive,\ntouching his hat like an automaton, raising the status of Mr. Ramornie in\nthe eyes of all the inn by his smiling service, and seeming capable of\nanything in the world but the one thing I had chosen—learning French!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII—THE ADVENTURE OF THE RUNAWAY COUPLE\n\n\nThe country had for some time back been changing in character.  By a\nthousand indications I could judge that I was again drawing near to\nScotland.  I saw it written in the face of the hills, in the growth of\nthe trees, and in the glint of the waterbrooks that kept the high-road\ncompany.  It might have occurred to me, also, that I was, at the same\ntime, approaching a place of some fame in Britain—Gretna Green.  Over\nthese same leagues of road—which Rowley and I now traversed in the\nclaret-coloured chaise, to the note of the flageolet and the French\nlesson—how many pairs of lovers had gone bowling northwards to the music\nof sixteen scampering horseshoes; and how many irate persons, parents,\nuncles, guardians, evicted rivals, had come tearing after, clapping the\nfrequent red face to the chaise-window, lavishly shedding their gold\nabout the post-houses, sedulously loading and re-loading, as they went,\ntheir avenging pistols!  But I doubt if I had thought of it at all,\nbefore a wayside hazard swept me into the thick of an adventure of this\nnature; and I found myself playing providence with other people’s lives,\nto my own admiration at the moment—and subsequently to my own brief but\npassionate regret.\n\nAt rather an ugly corner of an uphill reach I came on the wreck of a\nchaise lying on one side in the ditch, a man and a woman in animated\ndiscourse in the middle of the road, and the two postillions, each with\nhis pair of horses, looking on and laughing from the saddle.\n\n‘Morning breezes! here’s a smash!’ cried Rowley, pocketing his flageolet\nin the middle of the _Tight Little Island_.\n\nI was perhaps more conscious of the moral smash than the physical—more\nalive to broken hearts than to broken chaises; for, as plain as the sun\nat morning, there was a screw loose in this runaway match.  It is always\na bad sign when the lower classes laugh: their taste in humour is both\npoor and sinister; and for a man, running the posts with four horses,\npresumably with open pockets, and in the company of the most entrancing\nlittle creature conceivable, to have come down so far as to be laughed at\nby his own postillions, was only to be explained on the double\nhypothesis, that he was a fool and no gentleman.\n\nI have said they were man and woman.  I should have said man and child.\nShe was certainly not more than seventeen, pretty as an angel, just plump\nenough to damn a saint, and dressed in various shades of blue, from her\nstockings to her saucy cap, in a kind of taking gamut, the top note of\nwhich she flung me in a beam from her too appreciative eye.  There was no\ndoubt about the case: I saw it all.  From a boarding-school, a\nblack-board, a piano, and Clementi’s _Sonatinas_, the child had made a\nrash adventure upon life in the company of a half-bred hawbuck; and she\nwas already not only regretting it, but expressing her regret with point\nand pungency.\n\nAs I alighted they both paused with that unmistakable air of being\ninterrupted in a scene.  I uncovered to the lady and placed my services\nat their disposal.\n\nIt was the man who answered.  ‘There’s no use in shamming, sir,’ said he.\n‘This lady and I have run away, and her father’s after us: road to\nGretna, sir.  And here have these nincompoops spilt us in the ditch and\nsmashed the chaise!’\n\n‘Very provoking,’ said I.\n\n‘I don’t know when I’ve been so provoked!’ cried he, with a glance down\nthe road, of mortal terror.\n\n‘The father is no doubt very much incensed?’ I pursued civilly.\n\n‘O God!’ cried the hawbuck.  ‘In short, you see, we must get out of this.\nAnd I’ll tell you what—it may seem cool, but necessity has no law—if you\nwould lend us your chaise to the next post-house, it would be the very\nthing, sir.’\n\n‘I confess it seems cool,’ I replied.\n\n‘What’s that you say, sir?’ he snapped.\n\n‘I was agreeing with you,’ said I.  ‘Yes, it does seem cool; and what is\nmore to the point, it seems unnecessary.  This thing can be arranged in a\nmore satisfactory manner otherwise, I think.  You can doubtless ride?’\n\nThis opened a door on the matter of their previous dispute, and the\nfellow appeared life-sized in his true colours.  ‘That’s what I’ve been\ntelling her: that, damn her! she must ride!’ he broke out.  ‘And if the\ngentleman’s of the same mind, why, damme, you shall!’\n\nAs he said so, he made a snatch at her wrist, which she evaded with\nhorror.\n\nI stepped between them.\n\n‘No, sir,’ said I; ‘the lady shall not.’\n\nHe turned on me raging.  ‘And who are you to interfere?’ he roared.\n\n‘There is here no question of who I am,’ I replied.  ‘I may be the devil\nor the Archbishop of Canterbury for what you know, or need know.  The\npoint is that I can help you—it appears that nobody else can; and I will\ntell you how I propose to do it.  I will give the lady a seat in my\nchaise, if you will return the compliment by allowing my servant to ride\none of your horses.’\n\nI thought he would have sprung at my throat.\n\n‘You have always the alternative before you: to wait here for the arrival\nof papa,’ I added.\n\nAnd that settled him.  He cast another haggard look down the road, and\ncapitulated.\n\n‘I am sure, sir, the lady is very much obliged to you,’ he said, with an\nill grace.\n\nI gave her my hand; she mounted like a bird into the chaise; Rowley,\ngrinning from ear to ear, closed the door behind us; the two impudent\nrascals of post-boys cheered and laughed aloud as we drove off; and my\nown postillion urged his horses at once into a rattling trot.  It was\nplain I was supposed by all to have done a very dashing act, and ravished\nthe bride from the ravisher.\n\nIn the meantime I stole a look at the little lady.  She was in a state of\npitiable discomposure, and her arms shook on her lap in her black lace\nmittens.\n\n‘Madam—’ I began.\n\nAnd she, in the same moment, finding her voice: ‘O, what you must think\nof me!’\n\n‘Madam,’ said I, ‘what must any gentleman think when he sees youth,\nbeauty and innocence in distress?  I wish I could tell you that I was old\nenough to be your father; I think we must give that up,’ I continued,\nwith a smile.  ‘But I will tell you something about myself which ought to\ndo as well, and to set that little heart at rest in my society.  I am a\nlover.  May I say it of myself—for I am not quite used to all the\nniceties of English—that I am a true lover?  There is one whom I admire,\nadore, obey; she is no less good than she is beautiful; if she were here,\nshe would take you to her arms: conceive that she has sent me—that she\nhas said to me, “Go, be her knight!”’\n\n‘O, I know she must be sweet, I know she must be worthy of you!’ cried\nthe little lady.  ‘She would never forget female decorum—nor make the\nterrible _erratum_ I’ve done!’\n\nAnd at this she lifted up her voice and wept.\n\nThis did not forward matters: it was in vain that I begged her to be more\ncomposed and to tell me a plain, consecutive tale of her misadventures;\nbut she continued instead to pour forth the most extraordinary mixture of\nthe correct school miss and the poor untutored little piece of womanhood\nin a false position—of engrafted pedantry and incoherent nature.\n\n‘I am certain it must have been judicial blindness,’ she sobbed.  ‘I\ncan’t think how I didn’t see it, but I didn’t; and he isn’t, is he?  And\nthen a curtain rose . . . O, what a moment was that!  But I knew at once\nthat _you were_; you had but to appear from your carriage, and I knew it,\nO, she must be a fortunate young lady!  And I have no fear with you,\nnone—a perfect confidence.’\n\n‘Madam,’ said I, ‘a gentleman.’\n\n‘That’s what I mean—a gentleman,’ she exclaimed.  ‘And he—and that—_he_\nisn’t.  O, how shall I dare meet father!’  And disclosing to me her\ntear-stained face, and opening her arms with a tragic gesture: ‘And I am\nquite disgraced before all the young ladies, my school-companions!’ she\nadded.\n\n‘O, not so bad as that!’ I cried.  ‘Come, come, you exaggerate, my dear\nMiss—?  Excuse me if I am too familiar: I have not yet heard your name.’\n\n‘My name is Dorothy Greensleeves, sir: why should I conceal it?  I fear\nit will only serve to point an adage to future generations, and I had\nmeant so differently!  There was no young female in the county more\nemulous to be thought well of than I.  And what a fall was there!  O,\ndear me, what a wicked, piggish donkey of a girl I have made of myself,\nto be sure!  And there is no hope! O, Mr.—’\n\nAnd at that she paused and asked my name.\n\nI am not writing my eulogium for the Academy; I will admit it was\nunpardonably imbecile, but I told it her.  If you had been there—and seen\nher, ravishingly pretty and little, a baby in years and mind—and heard\nher talking like a book, with so much of schoolroom propriety in her\nmanner, with such an innocent despair in the matter—you would probably\nhave told her yours.  She repeated it after me.\n\n‘I shall pray for you all my life,’ she said.  ‘Every night, when I\nretire to rest, the last thing I shall do is to remember you by name.’\n\nPresently I succeeded in winning from her her tale, which was much what I\nhad anticipated: a tale of a schoolhouse, a walled garden, a fruit-tree\nthat concealed a bench, an impudent raff posturing in church, an exchange\nof flowers and vows over the garden wall, a silly schoolmate for a\nconfidante, a chaise and four, and the most immediate and perfect\ndisenchantment on the part of the little lady.  ‘And there is nothing to\nbe done!’ she wailed in conclusion.  ‘My error is irretrievable, I am\nquite forced to that conclusion.  O, Monsieur de Saint-Yves! who would\nhave thought that I could have been such a blind, wicked donkey!’\n\nI should have said before—only that I really do not know when it came\nin—that we had been overtaken by the two post-boys, Rowley and Mr.\nBellamy, which was the hawbuck’s name, bestriding the four post-horses;\nand that these formed a sort of cavalry escort, riding now before, now\nbehind the chaise, and Bellamy occasionally posturing at the window and\nobliging us with some of his conversation.  He was so ill-received that I\ndeclare I was tempted to pity him, remembering from what a height he had\nfallen, and how few hours ago it was since the lady had herself fled to\nhis arms, all blushes and ardour.  Well, these great strokes of fortune\nusually befall the unworthy, and Bellamy was now the legitimate object of\nmy commiseration and the ridicule of his own post-boys!\n\n‘Miss Dorothy,’ said I, ‘you wish to be delivered from this man?’\n\n‘O, if it were possible!’ she cried.  ‘But not by violence.’\n\n‘Not in the least, ma’am,’ I replied.  ‘The simplest thing in life.  We\nare in a civilised country; the man’s a malefactor—’\n\n‘O, never!’ she cried.  ‘Do not even dream it!  With all his faults, I\nknow he is not _that_.’\n\n‘Anyway, he’s in the wrong in this affair—on the wrong side of the law,\ncall it what you please,’ said I; and with that, our four horsemen having\nfor the moment headed us by a considerable interval, I hailed my post-boy\nand inquired who was the nearest magistrate and where he lived.\nArchdeacon Clitheroe, he told me, a prodigious dignitary, and one who\nlived but a lane or two back, and at the distance of only a mile or two\nout of the direct road.  I showed him the king’s medallion.\n\n‘Take the lady there, and at full gallop,’ I cried.\n\n‘Right, sir!  Mind yourself,’ says the postillion.\n\nAnd before I could have thought it possible, he had turned the carriage\nto the rightabout and we were galloping south.\n\nOur outriders were quick to remark and imitate the manoeuvre, and came\nflying after us with a vast deal of indiscriminate shouting; so that the\nfine, sober picture of a carriage and escort, that we had presented but a\nmoment back, was transformed in the twinkling of an eye into the image of\na noisy fox-chase.  The two postillions and my own saucy rogue were, of\ncourse, disinterested actors in the comedy; they rode for the mere sport,\nkeeping in a body, their mouths full of laughter, waving their hats as\nthey came on, and crying (as the fancy struck them) Tally-ho!’  ‘Stop,\nthief!’  ‘A highwayman!  A highwayman!’  It was otherguess work with\nBellamy.  That gentleman no sooner observed our change of direction than\nhe turned his horse with so much violence that the poor animal was almost\ncast upon its side, and launched her in immediate and desperate pursuit.\nAs he approached I saw that his face was deadly white and that he carried\na drawn pistol in his hand.  I turned at once to the poor little bride\nthat was to have been, and now was not to be; she, upon her side,\ndeserting the other window, turned as if to meet me.\n\n‘O, O, don’t let him kill me!’ she screamed.\n\n‘Never fear,’ I replied.\n\nHer face was distorted with terror.  Her hands took hold upon me with the\ninstinctive clutch of an infant.  The chaise gave a flying lurch, which\ntook the feet from under me and tumbled us anyhow upon the seat.  And\nalmost in the same moment the head of Bellamy appeared in the window\nwhich Missy had left free for him.\n\nConceive the situation!  The little lady and I were falling—or had just\nfallen—backward on the seat, and offered to the eye a somewhat ambiguous\npicture.  The chaise was speeding at a furious pace, and with the most\nviolent leaps and lurches, along the highway.  Into this bounding\nreceptacle Bellamy interjected his head, his pistol arm, and his pistol;\nand since his own horse was travelling still faster than the chaise, he\nmust withdraw all of them again in the inside of the fraction of a\nminute.  He did so, but he left the charge of the pistol behind\nhim—whether by design or accident I shall never know, and I dare say he\nhas forgotten!  Probably he had only meant to threaten, in hopes of\ncausing us to arrest our flight.  In the same moment came the explosion\nand a pitiful cry from Missy; and my gentleman, making certain he had\nstruck her, went down the road pursued by the furies, turned at the first\ncorner, took a flying leap over the thorn hedge, and disappeared across\ncountry in the least possible time.\n\nRowley was ready and eager to pursue; but I withheld him, thinking we\nwere excellently quit of Mr. Bellamy, at no more cost than a scratch on\nthe forearm and a bullet-hole in the left-hand claret-coloured panel.\nAnd accordingly, but now at a more decent pace, we proceeded on our way\nto Archdeacon Clitheroe’s, Missy’s gratitude and admiration were aroused\nto a high pitch by this dramatic scene, and what she was pleased to call\nmy wound.  She must dress it for me with her handkerchief, a service\nwhich she rendered me even with tears.  I could well have spared them,\nnot loving on the whole to be made ridiculous, and the injury being in\nthe nature of a cat’s scratch.  Indeed, I would have suggested for her\nkind care rather the cure of my coat-sleeve, which had suffered worse in\nthe encounter; but I was too wise to risk the anti-climax.  That she had\nbeen rescued by a hero, that the hero should have been wounded in the\naffray, and his wound bandaged with her handkerchief (which it could not\neven bloody), ministered incredibly to the recovery of her self-respect;\nand I could hear her relate the incident to ‘the young ladies, my\nschool-companions,’ in the most approved manner of Mrs. Radcliffe!  To\nhave insisted on the torn coat-sleeve would have been unmannerly, if not\ninhuman.\n\nPresently the residence of the archdeacon began to heave in sight.  A\nchaise and four smoking horses stood by the steps, and made way for us on\nour approach; and even as we alighted there appeared from the interior of\nthe house a tall ecclesiastic, and beside him a little, headstrong, ruddy\nman, in a towering passion, and brandishing over his head a roll of\npaper.  At sight of him Miss Dorothy flung herself on her knees with the\nmost moving adjurations, calling him father, assuring him she was wholly\ncured and entirely repentant of her disobedience, and entreating\nforgiveness; and I soon saw that she need fear no great severity from Mr.\nGreensleeves, who showed himself extraordinarily fond, loud, greedy of\ncaresses and prodigal of tears.\n\nTo give myself a countenance, as well as to have all ready for the road\nwhen I should find occasion, I turned to quit scores with Bellamy’s two\npostillions.  They had not the least claim on me, but one of which they\nwere quite ignorant—that I was a fugitive.  It is the worst feature of\nthat false position that every gratuity becomes a case of conscience.\nYou must not leave behind you any one discontented nor any one grateful.\nBut the whole business had been such a ‘hurrah-boys’ from the beginning,\nand had gone off in the fifth act so like a melodrama, in explosions,\nreconciliations, and the rape of a post-horse, that it was plainly\nimpossible to keep it covered.  It was plain it would have to be talked\nover in all the inn-kitchens for thirty miles about, and likely for six\nmonths to come.  It only remained for me, therefore, to settle on that\ngratuity which should be least conspicuous—so large that nobody could\ngrumble, so small that nobody would be tempted to boast.  My decision was\nhastily and nor wisely taken.  The one fellow spat on his tip (so he\ncalled it) for luck; the other developing a sudden streak of piety,\nprayed God bless me with fervour.  It seemed a demonstration was brewing,\nand I determined to be off at once.  Bidding my own post-boy and Rowley\nbe in readiness for an immediate start, I reascended the terrace and\npresented myself, hat in hand, before Mr. Greensleeves and the\narchdeacon.\n\n‘You will excuse me, I trust,’ said I.  ‘I think shame to interrupt this\nagreeable scene of family effusion, which I have been privileged in some\nsmall degree to bring about.’\n\nAnd at these words the storm broke.\n\n‘Small degree! small degree, sir!’ cries the father; ‘that shall not\npass, Mr. St. Eaves!  If I’ve got my darling back, and none the worse for\nthat vagabone rascal, I know whom I have to thank.  Shake hands with\nme—up to the elbows, sir!  A Frenchman you may be, but you’re one of the\nright breed, by God!  And, by God, sir, you may have anything you care to\nask of me, down to Dolly’s hand, by God!’\n\nAll this he roared out in a voice surprisingly powerful from so small a\nperson.  Every word was thus audible to the servants, who had followed\nthem out of the house and now congregated about us on the terrace, as\nwell as to Rowley and the five postillions on the gravel sweep below.\nThe sentiments expressed were popular; some ass, whom the devil moved to\nbe my enemy, proposed three cheers, and they were given with a will.  To\nhear my own name resounding amid acclamations in the hills of Westmorland\nwas flattering, perhaps; but it was inconvenient at a moment when (as I\nwas morally persuaded) police handbills were already speeding after me at\nthe rate of a hundred miles a day.\n\nNor was that the end of it.  The archdeacon must present his compliments,\nand pressed upon me some of his West India sherry, and I was carried into\na vastly fine library, where I was presented to his lady wife.  While we\nwere at sherry in the library, ale was handed round upon the terrace.\nSpeeches were made, hands were shaken, Missy (at her father’s request)\nkissed me farewell, and the whole party reaccompanied me to the terrace,\nwhere they stood waving hats and handkerchiefs, and crying farewells to\nall the echoes of the mountains until the chaise had disappeared.\n\nThe echoes of the mountains were engaged in saying to me privately: ‘You\nfool, you have done it now!’\n\n‘They do seem to have got ’old of your name, Mr. Anne,’ said Rowley.  ‘It\nweren’t my fault this time.’\n\n‘It was one of those accidents that can never be foreseen,’ said I,\naffecting a dignity that I was far from feeling.  ‘Some one recognised\nme.’\n\n‘Which on ’em, Mr. Anne?’ said the rascal.\n\n‘That is a senseless question; it can make no difference who it was,’ I\nreturned.\n\n‘No, nor that it can’t!’ cried Rowley.  ‘I say, Mr. Anne, sir, it’s what\nyou would call a jolly mess, ain’t it? looks like “clean bowled-out in\nthe middle stump,” don’t it?’\n\n‘I fail to understand you, Rowley.’\n\n‘Well, what I mean is, what are we to do about this one?’ pointing to the\npostillion in front of us, as he alternately hid and revealed his patched\nbreeches to the trot of his horse.  ‘He see you get in this morning under\n_Mr. Ramornie_—I was very piticular to _Mr. Ramornie_ you, if you\nremember, sir—and he see you get in again under Mr. Saint Eaves, and\nwhatever’s he going to see you get out under? that’s what worries me,\nsir.  It don’t seem to me like as if the position was what you call\n_stratetegic_!’\n\n‘_Parrrbleu_! will you let me be!’ I cried.  ‘I have to think; you cannot\nimagine how your constant idiotic prattle annoys me.’\n\n‘Beg pardon, Mr. Anne,’ said he; and the next moment, ‘You wouldn’t like\nfor us to do our French now, would you, Mr. Anne?’\n\n‘Certainly not,’ said I.  ‘Play upon your flageolet.’\n\nThe which he did with what seemed to me to be irony.\n\nConscience doth make cowards of us all!  I was so downcast by my pitiful\nmismanagement of the morning’s business that I shrank from the eye of my\nown hired infant, and read offensive meanings into his idle tootling.\n\nI took off my coat, and set to mending it, soldier-fashion, with a needle\nand thread.  There is nothing more conducive to thought, above all in\narduous circumstances; and as I sewed, I gradually gained a clearness\nupon my affairs.  I must be done with the claret-coloured chaise at once.\nIt should be sold at the next stage for what it would bring.  Rowley and\nI must take back to the road on our four feet, and after a decent\ninterval of trudging, get places on some coach for Edinburgh again under\nnew names!  So much trouble and toil, so much extra risk and expense and\nloss of time, and all for a slip of the tongue to a little lady in blue!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV—THE INN-KEEPER OF KIRKBY-LONSDALE\n\n\nI had hitherto conceived and partly carried out an ideal that was dear to\nmy heart.  Rowley and I descended from our claret-coloured chaise, a\ncouple of correctly dressed, brisk, bright-eyed young fellows, like a\npair of aristocratic mice; attending singly to our own affairs,\ncommunicating solely with each other, and that with the niceties and\ncivilities of drill.  We would pass through the little crowd before the\ndoor with high-bred preoccupation, inoffensively haughty, after the best\nEnglish pattern; and disappear within, followed by the envy and\nadmiration of the bystanders, a model master and servant, point-device in\nevery part.  It was a heavy thought to me, as we drew up before the inn\nat Kirkby-Lonsdale, that this scene was now to be enacted for the last\ntime.  Alas! and had I known it, it was to go of with so inferior a\ngrace!\n\nI had been injudiciously liberal to the post-boys of the chaise and four.\nMy own post-boy, he of the patched breeches, now stood before me, his\neyes glittering with greed, his hand advanced.  It was plain he\nanticipated something extraordinary by way of a _pourboire_; and\nconsidering the marches and counter-marches by which I had extended the\nstage, the military character of our affairs with Mr. Bellamy, and the\nbad example I had set before him at the archdeacon’s, something\nexceptional was certainly to be done.  But these are always nice\nquestions, to a foreigner above all: a shade too little will suggest\nniggardliness, a shilling too much smells of hush-money.  Fresh from the\nscene at the archdeacon’s, and flushed by the idea that I was now nearly\ndone with the responsibilities of the claret-coloured chaise, I put into\nhis hands five guineas; and the amount served only to waken his cupidity.\n\n‘O, come, sir, you ain’t going to fob me of with this?  Why, I seen fire\nat your side!’ he cried.\n\nIt would never do to give him more; I felt I should become the fable of\nKirkby-Lonsdale if I did; and I looked him in the face, sternly but still\nsmiling, and addressed him with a voice of uncompromising firmness.\n\n‘If you do not like it, give it back,’ said I.\n\nHe pocketed the guineas with the quickness of a conjurer, and, like a\nbase-born cockney as he was, fell instantly to casting dirt.\n\n‘’Ave your own way of it, Mr. Ramornie—leastways Mr. St. Eaves, or\nwhatever your blessed name may be.  Look ’ere’—turning for sympathy to\nthe stable-boys—‘this is a blessed business.  Blessed ’ard, I calls it.\n’Ere I takes up a blessed son of a pop-gun what calls hisself anything\nyou care to mention, and turns out to be a blessed _mounseer_ at the end\nof it!  ’Ere ’ave I been drivin’ of him up and down all day, a-carrying\noff of gals, a-shootin’ of pistyils, and a-drinkin’ of sherry and hale;\nand wot does he up and give me but a blank, blank, blanketing blank!’\n\nThe fellow’s language had become too powerful for reproduction, and I\npassed it by.\n\nMeanwhile I observed Rowley fretting visibly at the bit; another moment,\nand he would have added a last touch of the ridiculous to our arrival by\ncoming to his hands with the postillion.\n\n‘Rowley!’ cried I reprovingly.\n\nStrictly it should have been Gammon; but in the hurry of the moment, my\nfault (I can only hope) passed unperceived.  At the same time I caught\nthe eye of the postmaster.  He was long and lean, and brown and bilious;\nhe had the drooping nose of the humourist, and the quick attention of a\nman of parts.  He read my embarrassment in a glance, stepped instantly\nforward, sent the post-boy to the rightabout with half a word, and was\nback next moment at my side.\n\n‘Dinner in a private room, sir?  Very well.  John, No. 4!  What wine\nwould you care to mention?  Very well, sir.  Will you please to order\nfresh horses?  Not, sir?  Very well.’\n\nEach of these expressions was accompanied by something in the nature of a\nbow, and all were prefaced by something in the nature of a smile, which I\ncould very well have done without.  The man’s politeness was from the\nteeth outwards; behind and within, I was conscious of a perpetual\nscrutiny: the scene at his doorstep, the random confidences of the\npost-boy, had not been thrown away on this observer; and it was under a\nstrong fear of coming trouble that I was shown at last into my private\nroom.  I was in half a mind to have put off the whole business.  But the\ntruth is, now my name had got abroad, my fear of the mail that was\ncoming, and the handbills it should contain, had waxed inordinately, and\nI felt I could never eat a meal in peace till I had severed my connection\nwith the claret-coloured chaise.\n\nAccordingly, as soon as I had done with dinner, I sent my compliments to\nthe landlord and requested he should take a glass of wine with me.  He\ncame; we exchanged the necessary civilities, and presently I approached\nmy business.\n\n‘By the bye,’ said I, ‘we had a brush down the road to-day.  I dare say\nyou may have heard of it?’\n\nHe nodded.\n\n‘And I was so unlucky as to get a pistol ball in the panel of my chaise,’\nI continued, ‘which makes it simply useless to me.  Do you know any one\nlikely to buy?’\n\n‘I can well understand that,’ said the landlord, ‘I was looking at it\njust now; it’s as good as ruined, is that chaise.  General rule, people\ndon’t like chaises with bullet-holes.’\n\n‘Too much _Romance of the Forest_?’ I suggested, recalling my little\nfriend of the morning, and what I was sure had been her favourite\nreading—Mrs. Radcliffe’s novels.\n\n‘Just so,’ said he.  ‘They may be right, they may be wrong; I’m not the\njudge.  But I suppose it’s natural, after all, for respectable people to\nlike things respectable about them; not bullet-holes, nor puddles of\nblood, nor men with aliases.’\n\nI took a glass of wine and held it up to the light to show that my hand\nwas steady.\n\n‘Yes,’ said I, ‘I suppose so.’\n\n‘You have papers, of course, showing you are the proper owner?’ he\ninquired.\n\n‘There is the bill, stamped and receipted,’ said I, tossing it across to\nhim.\n\nHe looked at it.\n\n‘This all you have?’ he asked.\n\n‘It is enough, at least,’ said I.  ‘It shows you where I bought and what\nI paid for it.’\n\n‘Well, I don’t know,’ he said.  ‘You want some paper of identification.’\n\n‘To identify the chaise?’ I inquired.\n\n‘Not at all: to identify _you_,’ said he.\n\n‘My good sir, remember yourself!’ said I.  ‘The title-deeds of my estate\nare in that despatch-box; but you do not seriously suppose that I should\nallow you to examine them?’\n\n‘Well, you see, this paper proves that some Mr. Ramornie paid seventy\nguineas for a chaise,’ said the fellow.  ‘That’s all well and good; but\nwho’s to prove to me that you are Mr. Ramornie?’\n\n‘Fellow!’ cried I.\n\n‘O, fellow as much as you please!’ said he.  ‘Fellow, with all my heart!\nThat changes nothing.  I am fellow, of course—obtrusive fellow, impudent\nfellow, if you like—but who are you?  I hear of you with two names; I\nhear of you running away with young ladies, and getting cheered for a\nFrenchman, which seems odd; and one thing I will go bail for, that you\nwere in a blue fright when the post-boy began to tell tales at my door.\nIn short, sir, you may be a very good gentleman; but I don’t know enough\nabout you, and I’ll trouble you for your papers, or to go before a\nmagistrate.  Take your choice; if I’m not fine enough, I hope the\nmagistrates are.’\n\n‘My good man,’ I stammered, for though I had found my voice, I could\nscarce be said to have recovered my wits, ‘this is most unusual, most\nrude.  Is it the custom in Westmorland that gentlemen should be\ninsulted?’\n\n‘That depends,’ said he.  ‘When it’s suspected that gentlemen are spies\nit _is_ the custom; and a good custom, too.  No no,’ he broke out,\nperceiving me to make a movement.  ‘Both hands upon the table, my\ngentleman!  I want no pistol balls in my chaise panels.’\n\n‘Surely, sir, you do me strange injustice!’ said I, now the master of\nmyself.  ‘You see me sitting here, a monument of tranquillity: pray may I\nhelp myself to wine without umbraging you?’\n\nI took this attitude in sheer despair.  I had no plan, no hope.  The best\nI could imagine was to spin the business out some minutes longer, then\ncapitulate.  At least, I would not capituatle one moment too soon.\n\n‘Am I to take that for _no_?’ he asked.\n\n‘Referring to your former obliging proposal?’ said I.  ‘My good sir, you\nare to take it, as you say, for “No.”  Certainly I will not show you my\ndeeds; certainly I will not rise from table and trundle out to see your\nmagistrates.  I have too much respect for my digestion, and too little\ncuriosity in justices of the peace.’\n\nHe leaned forward, looked me nearly in the face, and reached out one hand\nto the bell-rope.  ‘See here, my fine fellow!’ said he.  ‘Do you see that\nbell-rope?  Let me tell you, there’s a boy waiting below: one jingle, and\nhe goes to fetch the constable.’\n\n‘Do you tell me so?’ said I.  ‘Well, there’s no accounting for tastes!  I\nhave a prejudice against the society of constables, but if it is your\nfancy to have one in for the dessert—’  I shrugged my shoulders lightly.\n‘Really, you know,’ I added, ‘this is vastly entertaining.  I assure you,\nI am looking on, with all the interest of a man of the world, at the\ndevelopment of your highly original character.’\n\nHe continued to study my face without speech, his hand still on the\nbutton of the bell-rope, his eyes in mine; this was the decisive heat.\nMy face seemed to myself to dislimn under his gaze, my expression to\nchange, the smile (with which I had began) to degenerate into the grin of\nthe man upon the rack.  I was besides harassed with doubts.  An innocent\nman, I argued, would have resented the fellow’s impudence an hour ago;\nand by my continued endurance of the ordeal, I was simply signing and\nsealing my confession; in short, I had reached the end of my powers.\n\n‘Have you any objection to my putting my hands in my breeches pockets?’ I\ninquired.  ‘Excuse me mentioning it, but you showed yourself so extremely\nnervous a moment back.’  My voice was not all I could have wished, but it\nsufficed.  I could hear it tremble, but the landlord apparently could\nnot.  He turned away and drew a long breath, and you may be sure I was\nquick to follow his example.\n\n‘You’re a cool hand at least, and that’s the sort I like,’ said he.  ‘Be\nyou what you please, I’ll deal square.  I’ll take the chaise for a\nhundred pound down, and throw the dinner in.’\n\n‘I beg your pardon,’ I cried, wholly mystified by this form of words.\n\n‘You pay me a hundred down,’ he repeated, ‘and I’ll take the chaise.\nIt’s very little more than it cost,’ he added, with a grin, ‘and you know\nyou must get it off your hands somehow.’\n\nI do not know when I have been better entertained than by this impudent\nproposal.  It was broadly funny, and I suppose the least tempting offer\nin the world.  For all that, it came very welcome, for it gave me the\noccasion to laugh.  This I did with the most complete abandonment, till\nthe tears ran down my cheeks; and ever and again, as the fit abated, I\nwould get another view of the landlord’s face, and go off into another\nparoxysm.\n\n‘You droll creature, you will be the death of me yet!’ I cried, drying my\neyes.\n\nMy friend was now wholly disconcerted; he knew not where to look, nor yet\nwhat to say; and began for the first time to conceive it possible he was\nmistaken.\n\n‘You seem rather to enjoy a laugh, sir,’ said he.\n\n‘O, yes!  I am quite an original,’ I replied, and laughed again.\n\nPresently, in a changed voice, he offered me twenty pounds for the\nchaise; I ran him up to twenty-five, and closed with the offer: indeed, I\nwas glad to get anything; and if I haggled, it was not in the desire of\ngain, but with the view at any price of securing a safe retreat.  For\nalthough hostilities were suspended, he was yet far from satisfied; and I\ncould read his continued suspicions in the cloudy eye that still hovered\nabout my face.  At last they took shape in words.\n\n‘This is all very well,’ says he: ‘you carry it off well; but for all\nthat, I must do my duty.’\n\nI had my strong effect in reserve; it was to burn my ships with a\nvengeance!  I rose.  ‘Leave the room,’ said I.  ‘This is insuperable.  Is\nthe man mad?’  And then, as if already half-ashamed of my passion: ‘I can\ntake a joke as well as any one,’ I added; ‘but this passes measure.  Send\nmy servant and the bill.’\n\nWhen he had left me alone, I considered my own valour with amazement.  I\nhad insulted him; I had sent him away alone; now, if ever, he would take\nwhat was the only sensible resource, and fetch the constable.  But there\nwas something instinctively treacherous about the man which shrank from\nplain courses.  And, with all his cleverness, he missed the occasion of\nfame.  Rowley and I were suffered to walk out of his door, with all our\nbaggage, on foot, with no destination named, except in the vague\nstatement that we were come ‘to view the lakes’; and my friend only\nwatched our departure with his chin in his hand, still moodily\nirresolute.\n\nI think this one of my great successes.  I was exposed, unmasked,\nsummoned to do a perfectly natural act, which must prove my doom and\nwhich I had not the slightest pretext for refusing.  I kept my head,\nstuck to my guns, and, against all likelihood, here I was once more at\nliberty and in the king’s highway.  This was a strong lesson never to\ndespair; and, at the same time, how many hints to be cautious! and what a\nperplexed and dubious business the whole question of my escape now\nappeared!  That I should have risked perishing upon a trumpery question\nof a _pourboire_, depicted in lively colours the perils that perpetually\nsurrounded us.  Though, to be sure, the initial mistake had been\ncommitted before that; and if I had not suffered myself to be drawn a\nlittle deep in confidences to the innocent Dolly, there need have been no\ntumble at the inn of Kirkby-Lonsdale.  I took the lesson to heart, and\npromised myself in the future to be more reserved.  It was none of my\nbusiness to attend to broken chaises or shipwrecked travellers.  I had my\nhands full of my own affairs; and my best defence would be a little more\nnatural selfishness and a trifle less imbecile good-nature.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV—I MEET A CHEERFUL EXTRAVAGANT\n\n\nI pass over the next fifty or sixty leagues of our journey without\ncomment.  The reader must be growing weary of scenes of travel; and for\nmy own part I have no cause to recall these particular miles with any\npleasure.  We were mainly occupied with attempts to obliterate our trail,\nwhich (as the result showed) were far from successful; for, on my cousin\nfollowing, he was able to run me home with the least possible loss of\ntime, following the claret-coloured chaise to Kirkby-Lonsdale, where I\nthink the landlord must have wept to learn what he had missed, and\ntracing us thereafter to the doors of the coach-office in Edinburgh\nwithout a single check.  Fortune did not favour me, and why should I\nrecapitulate the details of futile precautions which deceived nobody, and\nwearisome arts which proved to be artless?\n\nThe day was drawing to an end when Mr. Rowley and I bowled into Edinburgh\nto the stirring sound of the guard’s bugle and the clattering team.  I\nwas here upon my field of battle; on the scene of my former captivity,\nescape and exploits; and in the same city with my love.  My heart\nexpanded; I have rarely felt more of a hero.  All down the Bridges I sat\nby the driver with my arms folded and my face set, unflinchingly meeting\nevery eye, and prepared every moment for a cry of recognition.  Hundreds\nof the population were in the habit of visiting the Castle, where it was\nmy practice (before the days of Flora) to make myself conspicuous among\nthe prisoners; and I think it an extraordinary thing that I should have\nencountered so few to recognise me.  But doubtless a clean chin is a\ndisguise in itself; and the change is great from a suit of sulphur-yellow\nto fine linen, a well-fitting mouse-coloured great-coat furred in black,\na pair of tight trousers of fashionable cut, and a hat of inimitable\ncurl.  After all, it was more likely that I should have recognised our\nvisitors, than that they should have identified the modish gentleman with\nthe miserable prisoner in the Castle.\n\nI was glad to set foot on the flagstones, and to escape from the crowd\nthat had assembled to receive the mail.  Here we were, with but little\ndaylight before us, and that on Saturday afternoon, the eve of the famous\nScottish Sabbath, adrift in the New Town of Edinburgh, and overladen with\nbaggage.  We carried it ourselves.  I would not take a cab, nor so much\nas hire a porter, who might afterwards serve as a link between my\nlodgings and the mail, and connect me again with the claret-coloured\nchaise and Aylesbury.  For I was resolved to break the chain of evidence\nfor good, and to begin life afresh (so far as regards caution) with a new\ncharacter.  The first step was to find lodgings, and to find them\nquickly.  This was the more needful as Mr. Rowley and I, in our smart\nclothes and with our cumbrous burthen, made a noticeable appearance in\nthe streets at that time of the day and in that quarter of the town,\nwhich was largely given up to fine folk, bucks and dandies and young\nladies, or respectable professional men on their way home to dinner.\n\nOn the north side of St. James’ Square I was so happy as to spy a bill in\na third-floor window.  I was equally indifferent to cost and convenience\nin my choice of a lodging—‘any port in a storm’ was the principle on\nwhich I was prepared to act; and Rowley and I made at once for the common\nentrance and sealed the stair.\n\nWe were admitted by a very sour-looking female in bombazine.  I gathered\nshe had all her life been depressed by a series of bereavements, the last\nof which might very well have befallen her the day before; and I\ninstinctively lowered my voice when I addressed her.  She admitted she\nhad rooms to let—even showed them to us—a sitting-room and bedroom in a\n_suite_, commanding a fine prospect to the Firth and Fifeshire, and in\nthemselves well proportioned and comfortably furnished, with pictures on\nthe wall, shells on the mantelpiece, and several books upon the table\nwhich I found afterwards to be all of a devotional character, and all\npresentation copies, ‘to my Christian friend,’ or ‘to my devout\nacquaintance in the Lord, Bethiah McRankine.’  Beyond this my ‘Christian\nfriend’ could not be made to advance: no, not even to do that which\nseemed the most natural and pleasing thing in the world—I mean to name\nher price—but stood before us shaking her head, and at times mourning\nlike the dove, the picture of depression and defence.  She had a voice\nthe most querulous I have ever heard, and with this she produced a whole\nregiment of difficulties and criticisms.\n\nShe could not promise an attendance.\n\n‘Well, madam,’ said I, ‘and what is my servant for?’\n\n‘Him?’ she asked.  ‘Be gude to us!  Is _he_ your servant?’\n\n‘I am sorry, ma’am, he meets with your disapproval.’\n\n‘Na, I never said that.  But he’s young.  He’ll be a great breaker, I’m\nthinkin’.  Ay! he’ll be a great responsibeelity to ye, like.  Does he\nattend to his releegion?’\n\n‘Yes, m’m,’ returned Rowley, with admirable promptitude, and, immediately\nclosing his eyes, as if from habit, repeated the following distich with\nmore celerity than fervour:—\n\n    ‘Matthew, Mark, Luke and John\n    Bless the bed that I lie on!’\n\n‘Nhm!’ said the lady, and maintained an awful silence.\n\n‘Well, ma’am,’ said I, ‘it seems we are never to hear the beginning of\nyour terms, let alone the end of them.  Come—a good movement! and let us\nbe either off or on.’\n\nShe opened her lips slowly.  ‘Ony raferences?’ she inquired, in a voice\nlike a bell.\n\nI opened my pocket-book and showed her a handful of bank bills.  ‘I\nthink, madam, that these are unexceptionable,’ said I.\n\n‘Ye’ll be wantin’ breakfast late?’ was her reply.\n\n‘Madam, we want breakfast at whatever hour it suits you to give it, from\nfour in the morning till four in the afternoon!’ I cried.  ‘Only tell us\nyour figure, if your mouth be large enough to let it out!’\n\n‘I couldnae give ye supper the nicht,’ came the echo.\n\n‘We shall go out to supper, you incorrigible female!’ I vowed, between\nlaughter and tears.  ‘Here—this is going to end!  I want you for a\nlandlady—let me tell you that!—and I am going to have my way.  You won’t\ntell me what you charge?  Very well; I will do without!  I can trust you!\nYou don’t seem to know when you have a good lodger; but I know perfectly\nwhen I have an honest landlady!  Rowley, unstrap the valises!’\n\nWill it be credited?  The monomaniac fell to rating me for my\nindiscretion!  But the battle was over; these were her last guns, and\nmore in the nature of a salute than of renewed hostilities.  And\npresently she condescended on very moderate terms, and Rowley and I were\nable to escape in quest of supper.  Much time had, however, been lost;\nthe sun was long down, the lamps glimmered along the streets, and the\nvoice of a watchman already resounded in the neighbouring Leith Road.  On\nour first arrival I had observed a place of entertainment not far off, in\na street behind the Register House.  Thither we found our way, and sat\ndown to a late dinner alone.  But we had scarce given our orders before\nthe door opened, and a tall young fellow entered with something of a\nlurch, looked about him, and approached the same table.\n\n‘Give you good evening, most grave and reverend seniors!’ said he.  ‘Will\nyou permit a wanderer, a pilgrim—the pilgrim of love, in short—to come to\ntemporary anchor under your lee?  I care not who knows it, but I have a\npassionate aversion from the bestial practice of solitary feeding!’\n\n‘You are welcome, sir,’ said I, ‘if I may take upon me so far to play the\nhost in a public place.’\n\nHe looked startled, and fixed a hazy eye on me, as he sat down.\n\n‘Sir,’ said he, ‘you are a man not without some tincture of letters, I\nperceive!  What shall we drink, sir?’\n\nI mentioned I had already called for a pot of porter.\n\n‘A modest pot—the seasonable quencher?’ said he.  ‘Well, I do not know\nbut what I could look at a modest pot myself!  I am, for the moment, in\nprecarious health.  Much study hath heated my brain, much walking wearied\nmy—well, it seems to be more my eyes!’\n\n‘You have walked far, I dare say?’ I suggested.\n\n‘Not so much far as often,’ he replied.  ‘There is in this city—to which,\nI think, you are a stranger?  Sir, to your very good health and our\nbetter acquaintance!—there is, in this city of Dunedin, a certain\nimplication of streets which reflects the utmost credit on the designer\nand the publicans—at every hundred yards is seated the Judicious Tavern,\nso that persons of contemplative mind are secure, at moderate distances,\nof refreshment.  I have been doing a trot in that favoured quarter,\nfavoured by art and nature.  A few chosen comrades—enemies of publicity\nand friends to wit and wine—obliged me with their society.  “Along the\ncool, sequestered vale of Register Street we kept the uneven tenor of our\nway,” sir.’\n\n‘It struck me, as you came in—’ I began.\n\n‘O, don’t make any bones about it!’ he interrupted.  ‘Of course it struck\nyou! and let me tell you I was devilish lucky not to strike myself.  When\nI entered this apartment I shone “with all the pomp and prodigality of\nbrandy and water,” as the poet Gray has in another place expressed it.\nPowerful bard, Gray! but a niminy-piminy creature, afraid of a petticoat\nand a bottle—not a man, sir, not a man!  Excuse me for being so\ntroublesome, but what the devil have I done with my fork?  Thank you, I\nam sure.  _Temulentia_, _quoad me ipsum_, _brevis colligo est_.  I sit\nand eat, sir, in a London fog.  I should bring a link-boy to table with\nme; and I would too, if the little brutes were only washed!  I intend to\nfound a Philanthropical Society for Washing the Deserving Poor and\nShaving Soldiers.  I am pleased to observe that, although not of an\nunmilitary bearing, you are apparently shaved.  In my calendar of the\nvirtues shaving comes next to drinking.  A gentleman may be a low-minded\nruffian without sixpence, but he will always be close shaved.  See me,\nwith the eye of fancy, in the chill hours of the morning, say about a\nquarter to twelve, noon—see me awake!  First thing of all, without one\nthought of the plausible but unsatisfactory small beer, or the healthful\nthough insipid soda-water, I take the deadly razor in my vacillating\ngrasp; I proceed to skate upon the margin of eternity.  Stimulating\nthought!  I bleed, perhaps, but with medicable wounds.  The stubble\nreaped, I pass out of my chamber, calm but triumphant.  To employ a\nhackneyed phrase, I would not call Lord Wellington my uncle!  I, too,\nhave dared, perhaps bled, before the imminent deadly shaving-table.’\n\nIn this manner the bombastic fellow continued to entertain me all through\ndinner, and by a common error of drunkards, because he had been extremely\ntalkative himself, leaped to the conclusion that he had chanced on very\ngenial company.  He told me his name, his address; he begged we should\nmeet again; finally he proposed that I should dine with him in the\ncountry at an early date.\n\n‘The dinner is official,’ he explained.  ‘The office-bearers and Senatus\nof the University of Cramond—an educational institution in which I have\nthe honour to be Professor of Nonsense—meet to do honour to our friend\nIcarus, at the old-established _howff_, Cramond Bridge.  One place is\nvacant, fascinating stranger,—I offer it to you!’\n\n‘And who is your friend Icarus?’ I asked,\n\n‘The aspiring son of Daedalus!’ said he.  ‘Is it possible that you have\nnever heard the name of Byfield?’\n\n‘Possible and true,’ said I.\n\n‘And is fame so small a thing?’ cried he.  ‘Byfield, sir, is an aeronaut.\nHe apes the fame of a Lunardi, and is on the point of offering to the\ninhabitants—I beg your pardon, to the nobility and gentry of our\nneighbourhood—the spectacle of an ascension.  As one of the gentry\nconcerned I may be permitted to remark that I am unmoved.  I care not a\nTinker’s Damn for his ascension.  No more—I breathe it in your ear—does\nanybody else.  The business is stale, sir, stale.  Lunardi did it, and\noverdid it.  A whimsical, fiddling, vain fellow, by all accounts—for I\nwas at that time rocking in my cradle.  But once was enough.  If Lunardi\nwent up and came down, there was the matter settled.  We prefer to grant\nthe point.  We do not want to see the experiment repeated _ad nauseam_ by\nByfield, and Brown, and Butler, and Brodie, and Bottomley.  Ah! if they\nwould go up and _not_ come down again!  But this is by the question.  The\nUniversity of Cramond delights to honour merit in the man, sir, rather\nthan utility in the profession; and Byfield, though an ignorant dog, is a\nsound reliable drinker, and really not amiss over his cups.  Under the\nradiance of the kindly jar partiality might even credit him with wit.’\n\nIt will be seen afterwards that this was more my business than I thought\nit at the time.  Indeed, I was impatient to be gone.  Even as my friend\nmaundered ahead a squall burst, the jaws of the rain were opened against\nthe coffee-house windows, and at that inclement signal I remembered I was\ndue elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI—THE COTTAGE AT NIGHT\n\n\nAt the door I was nearly blown back by the unbridled violence of the\nsquall, and Rowley and I must shout our parting words.  All the way along\nPrinces Street (whither my way led) the wind hunted me behind and\nscreamed in my ears.  The city was flushed with bucketfuls of rain that\ntasted salt from the neighbouring ocean.  It seemed to darken and lighten\nagain in the vicissitudes of the gusts.  Now you would say the lamps had\nbeen blown out from end to end of the long thoroughfare; now, in a lull,\nthey would revive, re-multiply, shine again on the wet pavements, and\nmake darkness sparingly visible.\n\nBy the time I had got to the corner of the Lothian Road there was a\ndistinct improvement.  For one thing, I had now my shoulder to the wind;\nfor a second, I came in the lee of my old prison-house, the Castle; and,\nat any rate, the excessive fury of the blast was itself moderating.  The\nthought of what errand I was on re-awoke within me, and I seemed to\nbreast the rough weather with increasing ease.  With such a destination,\nwhat mattered a little buffeting of wind or a sprinkle of cold water?  I\nrecalled Flora’s image, I took her in fancy to my arms, and my heart\nthrobbed.  And the next moment I had recognised the inanity of that\nfool’s paradise.  If I could spy her taper as she went to bed, I might\ncount myself lucky.\n\nI had about two leagues before me of a road mostly uphill, and now deep\nin mire.  So soon as I was clear of the last street lamp, darkness\nreceived me—a darkness only pointed by the lights of occasional rustic\nfarms, where the dogs howled with uplifted heads as I went by.  The wind\ncontinued to decline: it had been but a squall, not a tempest.  The rain,\non the other hand, settled into a steady deluge, which had soon drenched\nme thoroughly.  I continued to tramp forward in the night, contending\nwith gloomy thoughts and accompanied by the dismal ululation of the dogs.\nWhat ailed them that they should have been thus wakeful, and perceived\nthe small sound of my steps amid the general reverberation of the rain,\nwas more than I could fancy.  I remembered tales with which I had been\nentertained in childhood.  I told myself some murderer was going by, and\nthe brutes perceived upon him the faint smell of blood; and the next\nmoment, with a physical shock, I had applied the words to my own case!\n\nHere was a dismal disposition for a lover.  ‘Was ever lady in this humour\nwooed?’ I asked myself, and came near turning back.  It is never wise to\nrisk a critical interview when your spirits are depressed, your clothes\nmuddy, and your hands wet!  But the boisterous night was in itself\nfavourable to my enterprise: now, or perhaps never, I might find some way\nto have an interview with Flora; and if I had one interview (wet clothes,\nlow spirits and all), I told myself there would certainly be another.\n\nArrived in the cottage-garden I found the circumstances mighty inclement.\nFrom the round holes in the shutters of the parlour, shafts of\ncandle-light streamed forth; elsewhere the darkness was complete.  The\ntrees, the thickets, were saturated; the lower parts of the garden turned\ninto a morass.  At intervals, when the wind broke forth again, there\npassed overhead a wild coil of clashing branches; and between whiles the\nwhole enclosure continuously and stridently resounded with the rain.  I\nadvanced close to the window and contrived to read the face of my watch.\nIt was half-past seven; they would not retire before ten, they might not\nbefore midnight, and the prospect was unpleasant.  In a lull of the wind\nI could hear from the inside the voice of Flora reading aloud; the words\nof course inaudible—only a flow of undecipherable speech, quiet, cordial,\ncolourless, more intimate and winning, more eloquent of her personality,\nbut not less beautiful than song.  And the next moment the clamour of a\nfresh squall broke out about the cottage; the voice was drowned in its\nbellowing, and I was glad to retreat from my dangerous post.\n\nFor three egregious hours I must now suffer the elements to do their\nworst upon me, and continue to hold my ground in patience.  I recalled\nthe least fortunate of my services in the field: being out-sentry of the\npickets in weather no less vile, sometimes unsuppered and with nothing to\nlook forward to by way of breakfast but musket-balls; and they seemed\nlight in comparison.  So strangely are we built: so much more strong is\nthe love of woman than the mere love of life.\n\nAt last my patience was rewarded.  The light disappeared from the parlour\nand reappeared a moment after in the room above.  I was pretty well\ninformed for the enterprise that lay before me.  I knew the lair of the\ndragon—that which was just illuminated.  I knew the bower of my Rosamond,\nand how excellently it was placed on the ground-level, round the flank of\nthe cottage and out of earshot of her formidable aunt.  Nothing was left\nbut to apply my knowledge.  I was then at the bottom of the garden,\nwhether I had gone (Heaven save the mark!) for warmth, that I might walk\nto and fro unheard and keep myself from perishing.  The night had fallen\nstill, the wind ceased; the noise of the rain had much lightened, if it\nhad not stopped, and was succeeded by the dripping of the garden trees.\nIn the midst of this lull, and as I was already drawing near to the\ncottage, I was startled by the sound of a window-sash screaming in its\nchannels; and a step or two beyond I became aware of a gush of light upon\nthe darkness.  It fell from Flora’s window, which she had flung open on\nthe night, and where she now sat, roseate and pensive, in the shine of\ntwo candles falling from behind, her tresses deeply embowering and\nshading her; the suspended comb still in one hand, the other idly\nclinging to the iron stanchions with which the window was barred.\n\nKeeping to the turf, and favoured by the darkness of the night and the\npatter of the rain which was now returning, though without wind, I\napproached until I could almost have touched her.  It seemed a grossness\nof which I was incapable to break up her reverie by speech.  I stood and\ndrank her in with my eyes; how the light made a glory in her hair, and\n(what I have always thought the most ravishing thing in nature) how the\nplanes ran into each other, and were distinguished, and how the hues\nblended and varied, and were shaded off, between the cheek and neck.  At\nfirst I was abashed: she wore her beauty like an immediate halo of\nrefinement; she discouraged me like an angel, or what I suspect to be the\nnext most discouraging, a modern lady.  But as I continued to gaze, hope\nand life returned to me; I forgot my timidity, I forgot the sickening\npack of wet clothes with which I stood burdened, I tingled with new\nblood.\n\nStill unconscious of my presence, still gazing before her upon the\nilluminated image of the window, the straight shadows of the bars, the\nglinting of pebbles on the path, and the impenetrable night on the garden\nand the hills beyond it, she heaved a deep breath that struck upon my\nheart like an appeal.\n\n‘Why does Miss Gilchrist sigh?’ I whispered.  ‘Does she recall absent\nfriends?’\n\nShe turned her head swiftly in my direction; it was the only sign of\nsurprise she deigned to make.  At the same time I stepped into the light\nand bowed profoundly.\n\n‘You!’ she said.  ‘Here?’\n\n‘Yes, I am here,’ I replied.  ‘I have come very far, it may be a hundred\nand fifty leagues, to see you.  I have waited all this night in your\ngarden.  Will Miss Gilchrist not offer her hand—to a friend in trouble?’\n\nShe extended it between the bars, and I dropped upon one knee on the wet\npath and kissed it twice.  At the second it was withdrawn suddenly,\nmethought with more of a start than she had hitherto displayed.  I\nregained my former attitude, and we were both silent awhile.  My timidity\nreturned on me tenfold.  I looked in her face for any signals of anger,\nand seeing her eyes to waver and fall aside from mine, augured that all\nwas well.\n\n‘You must have been mad to come here!’ she broke out.  ‘Of all places\nunder heaven this is no place for you to come.  And I was just thinking\nyou were safe in France!’\n\n‘You were thinking of me!’ I cried.\n\n‘Mr. St. Ives, you cannot understand your danger,’ she replied.  ‘I am\nsure of it, and yet I cannot find it in my heart to tell you.  O, be\npersuaded, and go!’\n\n‘I believe I know the worst.  But I was never one to set an undue value\non life, the life that we share with beasts.  My university has been in\nthe wars, not a famous place of education, but one where a man learns to\ncarry his life in his hand as lightly as a glove, and for his lady or his\nhonour to lay it as lightly down.  You appeal to my fears, and you do\nwrong.  I have come to Scotland with my eyes quite open to see you and to\nspeak with you—it may be for the last time.  With my eyes quite open, I\nsay; and if I did not hesitate at the beginning do you think that I would\ndraw back now?’\n\n‘You do not know!’ she cried, with rising agitation.  ‘This country, even\nthis garden, is death to you.  They all believe it; I am the only one\nthat does not.  If they hear you now, if they heard a whisper—I dread to\nthink of it.  O, go, go this instant.  It is my prayer.’\n\n‘Dear lady, do not refuse me what I have come so far to seek; and\nremember that out of all the millions in England there is no other but\nyourself in whom I can dare confide.  I have all the world against me;\nyou are my only ally; and as I have to speak, you have to listen.  All is\ntrue that they say of me, and all of it false at the same time.  I did\nkill this man Goguelat—it was that you meant?’\n\nShe mutely signed to me that it was; she had become deadly pale.\n\n‘But I killed him in fair fight.  Till then, I had never taken a life\nunless in battle, which is my trade.  But I was grateful, I was on fire\nwith gratitude, to one who had been good to me, who had been better to me\nthan I could have dreamed of an angel, who had come into the darkness of\nmy prison like sunrise.  The man Goguelat insulted her.  O, he had\ninsulted me often, it was his favourite pastime, and he might insult me\nas he pleased—for who was I?  But with that lady it was different.  I\ncould never forgive myself if I had let it pass.  And we fought, and he\nfell, and I have no remorse.’\n\nI waited anxiously for some reply.  The worst was now out, and I knew\nthat she had heard of it before; but it was impossible for me to go on\nwith my narrative without some shadow of encouragement.\n\n‘You blame me?’\n\n‘No, not at all.  It is a point I cannot speak on—I am only a girl.  I am\nsure you were in the right: I have always said so—to Ronald.  Not, of\ncourse, to my aunt.  I am afraid I let her speak as she will.  You must\nnot think me a disloyal friend; and even with the Major—I did not tell\nyou he had become quite a friend of ours—Major Chevenix, I mean—he has\ntaken such a fancy to Ronald!  It was he that brought the news to us of\nthat hateful Clausel being captured, and all that he was saying.  I was\nindignant with him.  I said—I dare say I said too much—and I must say he\nwas very good-natured.  He said, “You and I, who are his friends, _know_\nthat Champdivers is innocent.  But what is the use of saying it?”  All\nthis was in the corner of the room in what they call an aside.  And then\nhe said, “Give me a chance to speak to you in private, I have much to\ntell you.”  And he did.  And told me just what you did—that it was an\naffair of honour, and no blame attached to you.  O, I must say I like\nthat Major Chevenix!’\n\nAt this I was seized with a great pang of jealousy.  I remembered the\nfirst time that he had seen her, the interest that he seemed immediately\nto conceive; and I could not but admire the dog for the use he had been\ningenious enough to make of our acquaintance in order to supplant me.\nAll is fair in love and war.  For all that, I was now no less anxious to\ndo the speaking myself than I had been before to hear Flora.  At least, I\ncould keep clear of the hateful image of Major Chevenix.  Accordingly I\nburst at once on the narrative of my adventures.  It was the same as you\nhave read, but briefer, and told with a very different purpose.  Now\nevery incident had a particular bearing, every by-way branched off to\nRome—and that was Flora.\n\nWhen I had begun to speak I had kneeled upon the gravel withoutside the\nlow window, rested my arms upon the sill, and lowered my voice to the\nmost confidential whisper.  Flora herself must kneel upon the other side,\nand this brought our heads upon a level with only the bars between us.\nSo placed, so separated, it seemed that our proximity, and the continuous\nand low sounds of my pleading voice, worked progressively and powerfully\non her heart, and perhaps not less so on my own.  For these spells are\ndouble-edged.  The silly birds may be charmed with the pipe of the\nfowler, which is but a tube of reeds.  Not so with a bird of our own\nfeather!  As I went on, and my resolve strengthened, and my voice found\nnew modulations, and our faces were drawn closer to the bars and to each\nother, not only she, but I, succumbed to the fascination, and were\nkindled by the charm.  We make love, and thereby ourselves fall the\ndeeper in it.  It is with the heart only that one captures a heart.\n\n‘And now,’ I continued, ‘I will tell you what you can still do for me.  I\nrun a little risk just now, and you see for yourself how unavoidable it\nis for any man of honour.  But if—but in case of the worst I do not\nchoose to enrich either my enemies or the Prince Regent.  I have here the\nbulk of what my uncle gave me.  Eight thousand odd pounds.  Will you take\ncare of it for me?  Do not think of it merely as money; take and keep it\nas a relic of your friend or some precious piece of him.  I may have\nbitter need of it ere long.  Do you know the old country story of the\ngiant who gave his heart to his wife to keep for him, thinking it safer\nto repose on her loyalty than his own strength?  Flora, I am the giant—a\nvery little one: will you be the keeper of my life?  It is my heart I\noffer you in this symbol.  In the sight of God, if you will have it, I\ngive you my name, I endow you with my money.  If the worst come, if I may\nnever hope to call you wife, let me at least think that you will use my\nuncle’s legacy as my widow.’\n\n‘No, not that,’ she said.  ‘Never that.’\n\n‘What then?’ I said.  ‘What else, my angel?  What are words to me?  There\nis but one name that I care to know you by.  Flora, my love!’\n\n‘Anne!’ she said.\n\nWhat sound is so full of music as one’s own name uttered for the first\ntime in the voice of her we love!\n\n‘My darling!’ said I.\n\nThe jealous bars, set at the top and bottom in stone and lime, obstructed\nthe rapture of the moment; but I took her to myself as wholly as they\nallowed.  She did not shun my lips.  My arms were wound round her body,\nwhich yielded itself generously to my embrace.  As we so remained,\nentwined and yet severed, bruising our faces unconsciously on the cold\nbars, the irony of the universe—or as I prefer to say, envy of some of\nthe gods—again stirred up the elements of that stormy night.  The wind\nblew again in the tree-tops; a volley of cold sea-rain deluged the\ngarden, and, as the deuce would have it, a gutter which had been hitherto\nchoked up began suddenly to play upon my head and shoulders with the\nvivacity of a fountain.  We parted with a shock; I sprang to my feet, and\nshe to hers, as though we had been discovered.  A moment after, but now\nboth standing, we had again approached the window on either side.\n\n‘Flora,’ I said, ‘this is but a poor offer I can make you.’\n\nShe took my hand in hers and clasped it to her bosom.\n\n‘Rich enough for a queen!’ she said, with a lift in her breathing that\nwas more eloquent than words.  ‘Anne, my brave Anne!  I would be glad to\nbe your maidservant; I could envy that boy Rowley.  But, no!’ she broke\noff, ‘I envy no one—I need not—I am yours.’\n\n‘Mine,’ said I, ‘for ever!  By this and this, mine!’\n\n‘All of me,’ she repeated.  ‘Altogether and forever!’\n\nAnd if the god were envious, he must have seen with mortification how\nlittle he could do to mar the happiness of mortals.  I stood in a mere\nwaterspout; she herself was wet, not from my embrace only, but from the\nsplashing of the storm.  The candles had guttered out; we were in\ndarkness.  I could scarce see anything but the shining of her eyes in the\ndark room.  To her I must have appeared as a silhouette, haloed by rain\nand the spouting of the ancient Gothic gutter above my head.\n\nPresently we became more calm and confidential; and when that squall,\nwhich proved to be the last of the storm, had blown by, fell into a talk\nof ways and means.  It seemed she knew Mr. Robbie, to whom I had been so\nslenderly accredited by Romaine—was even invited to his house for the\nevening of Monday, and gave me a sketch of the old gentleman’s character\nwhich implied a great deal of penetration in herself, and proved of great\nuse to me in the immediate sequel.  It seemed he was an enthusiastic\nantiquary, and in particular a fanatic of heraldry.  I heard it with\ndelight, for I was myself, thanks to M. de Culemberg, fairly grounded in\nthat science, and acquainted with the blazons of most families of note in\nEurope.  And I had made up my mind—even as she spoke, it was my fixed\ndetermination, though I was a hundred miles from saying it—to meet Flora\non Monday night as a fellow-guest in Mr. Robbie’s house.\n\nI gave her my money—it was, of course, only paper I had brought.  I gave\nit her, to be her marriage-portion, I declared.\n\n‘Not so bad a marriage-portion for a private soldier,’ I told her,\nlaughing, as I passed it through the bars.\n\n‘O, Anne, and where am I to keep it?’ she cried.  ‘If my aunt should find\nit!  What would I say!’\n\n‘Next your heart,’ I suggested.\n\n‘Then you will always be near your treasure,’ she cried, ‘for you are\nalways there!’\n\nWe were interrupted by a sudden clearness that fell upon the night.  The\nclouds dispersed; the stars shone in every part of the heavens; and,\nconsulting my watch, I was startled to find it already hard on five in\nthe morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII—THE SABBATH DAY\n\n\nIt was indeed high time I should be gone from Swanston; but what I was to\ndo in the meanwhile was another question.  Rowley had received his orders\nlast night: he was to say that I had met a friend, and Mrs. McRankine was\nnot to expect me before morning.  A good enough tale in itself; but the\ndreadful pickle I was in made it out of the question.  I could not go\nhome till I had found harbourage, a fire to dry my clothes at, and a bed\nwhere I might lie till they were ready.\n\nFortune favoured me again.  I had scarce got to the top of the first hill\nwhen I spied a light on my left, about a furlong away.  It might be a\ncase of sickness; what else it was likely to be—in so rustic a\nneighbourhood, and at such an ungodly time of the morning—was beyond my\nfancy.  A faint sound of singing became audible, and gradually swelled as\nI drew near, until at last I could make out the words, which were\nsingularly appropriate both to the hour and to the condition of the\nsingers.  ‘The cock may craw, the day may daw,’ they sang; and sang it\nwith such laxity both in time and tune, and such sentimental complaisance\nin the expression, as assured me they had got far into the third bottle\nat least.\n\nI found a plain rustic cottage by the wayside, of the sort called double,\nwith a signboard over the door; and, the lights within streaming forth\nand somewhat mitigating the darkness of the morning, I was enabled to\ndecipher the inscription: ‘The Hunters’ Tryst, by Alexander Hendry.\nPorter Ales, and British Spirits.  Beds.’\n\nMy first knock put a period to the music, and a voice challenged tipsily\nfrom within.\n\n‘Who goes there?’ it said; and I replied, ‘A lawful traveller.’\n\nImmediately after, the door was unbarred by a company of the tallest lads\nmy eyes had ever rested on, all astonishingly drunk and very decently\ndressed, and one (who was perhaps the drunkest of the lot) carrying a\ntallow candle, from which he impartially bedewed the clothes of the whole\ncompany.  As soon as I saw them I could not help smiling to myself to\nremember the anxiety with which I had approached.  They received me and\nmy hastily-concocted story, that I had been walking from Peebles and had\nlost my way, with incoherent benignity; jostled me among them into the\nroom where they had been sitting, a plain hedgerow alehouse parlour, with\na roaring fire in the chimney and a prodigious number of empty bottles on\nthe floor; and informed me that I was made, by this reception, a\ntemporary member of the _Six-Feet-High Club_, an athletic society of\nyoung men in a good station, who made of the Hunters’ Tryst a frequent\nresort.  They told me I had intruded on an ‘all-night sitting,’ following\nupon an ‘all-day Saturday tramp’ of forty miles; and that the members\nwould all be up and ‘as right as ninepence’ for the noonday service at\nsome neighbouring church—Collingwood, if memory serves me right.  At this\nI could have laughed, but the moment seemed ill-chosen.  For, though six\nfeet was their standard, they all exceeded that measurement considerably;\nand I tasted again some of the sensations of childhood, as I looked up to\nall these lads from a lower plane, and wondered what they would do next.\nBut the Six-Footers, if they were very drunk, proved no less kind.  The\nlandlord and servants of the Hunters’ Tryst were in bed and asleep long\nago.  Whether by natural gift or acquired habit they could suffer\npandemonium to reign all over the house, and yet lie ranked in the\nkitchen like Egyptian mummies, only that the sound of their snoring rose\nand fell ceaselessly like the drone of a bagpipe.  Here the Six-Footers\ninvaded them—in their citadel, so to speak; counted the bunks and the\nsleepers; proposed to put me in bed to one of the lasses, proposed to\nhave one of the lasses out to make room for me, fell over chairs, and\nmade noise enough to waken the dead: the whole illuminated by the same\nyoung torch-bearer, but now with two candles, and rapidly beginning to\nlook like a man in a snowstorm.  At last a bed was found for me, my\nclothes were hung out to dry before the parlour fire, and I was\nmercifully left to my repose.\n\nI awoke about nine with the sun shining in my eyes.  The landlord came at\nmy summons, brought me my clothes dried and decently brushed, and gave me\nthe good news that the Six-Feet-High Club were all abed and sleeping off\ntheir excesses.  Where they were bestowed was a puzzle to me until (as I\nwas strolling about the garden patch waiting for breakfast) I came on a\nbarn door, and, looking in, saw all the red face mixed in the straw like\nplums in a cake.  Quoth the stalwart maid who brought me my porridge and\nbade me ’eat them while they were hot,’ ‘Ay, they were a’ on the ran-dan\nlast nicht!  Hout! they’re fine lads, and they’ll be nane the waur of it.\nForby Farbes’s coat.  I dinna see wha’s to get the creish off that!’ she\nadded, with a sigh; in which, identifying Forbes as the torch-bearer, I\nmentally joined.\n\nIt was a brave morning when I took the road; the sun shone, spring seemed\nin the air, it smelt like April or May, and some over-venturous birds\nsang in the coppices as I went by.  I had plenty to think of, plenty to\nbe grateful for, that gallant morning; and yet I had a twitter at my\nheart.  To enter the city by daylight might be compared to marching on a\nbattery; every face that I confronted would threaten me like the muzzle\nof a gun; and it came into my head suddenly with how much better a\ncountenance I should be able to do it if I could but improvise a\ncompanion.  Hard by Merchiston I was so fortunate as to observe a bulky\ngentleman in broadcloth and gaiters, stooping with his head almost\nbetween his knees, before a stone wall.  Seizing occasion by the\nforelock, I drew up as I came alongside and inquired what he had found to\ninterest him.\n\nHe turned upon me a countenance not much less broad than his back.\n\n‘Why, sir,’ he replied, ‘I was even marvelling at my own indefeasible\nstupeedity: that I should walk this way every week of my life, weather\npermitting, and should never before have _notticed_ that stone,’ touching\nit at the same time with a goodly oak staff.\n\nI followed the indication.  The stone, which had been built sideways into\nthe wall, offered traces of heraldic sculpture.  At once there came a\nwild idea into my mind: his appearance tallied with Flora’s description\nof Mr. Robbie; a knowledge of heraldry would go far to clinch the proof;\nand what could be more desirable than to scrape an informal acquaintance\nwith the man whom I must approach next day with my tale of the drovers,\nand whom I yet wished to please?  I stooped in turn.\n\n‘A chevron,’ I said; ‘on a chief three mullets?  Looks like Douglas, does\nit not?’\n\n‘Yes, sir, it does; you are right,’ said he: ‘it _does_ look like\nDouglas; though, without the tinctures, and the whole thing being so\nbattered and broken up, who shall venture an opinion?  But allow me to be\nmore personal, sir.  In these degenerate days I am astonished you should\ndisplay so much proficiency.’\n\n‘O, I was well grounded in my youth by an old gentleman, a friend of my\nfamily, and I may say my guardian,’ said I; ‘but I have forgotten it\nsince.  God forbid I should delude you into thinking me a herald, sir!  I\nam only an ungrammatical amateur.’\n\n‘And a little modesty does no harm even in a herald,’ says my new\nacquaintance graciously.\n\nIn short, we fell together on our onward way, and maintained very\namicable discourse along what remained of the country road, past the\nsuburbs, and on into the streets of the New Town, which was as deserted\nand silent as a city of the dead.  The shops were closed, no vehicle ran,\ncats sported in the midst of the sunny causeway; and our steps and voices\nre-echoed from the quiet houses.  It was the high-water, full and\nstrange, of that weekly trance to which the city of Edinburgh is\nsubjected: the apotheosis of the _Sawbath_; and I confess the spectacle\nwanted not grandeur, however much it may have lacked cheerfulness.  There\nare few religious ceremonies more imposing.  As we thus walked and talked\nin a public seclusion the bells broke out ringing through all the bounds\nof the city, and the streets began immediately to be thronged with decent\nchurch-goers.\n\n‘Ah!’ said my companion, ‘there are the bells!  Now, sir, as you are a\nstranger I must offer you the hospitality of my pew.  I do not know\nwhether you are at all used with our Scottish form; but in case you are\nnot I will find your places for you; and Dr. Henry Gray, of St. Mary’s\n(under whom I sit), is as good a preacher as we have to show you.’\n\nThis put me in a quandary.  It was a degree of risk I was scarce prepared\nfor.  Dozens of people, who might pass me by in the street with no more\nthan a second look, would go on from the second to the third, and from\nthat to a final recognition, if I were set before them, immobilised in a\npew, during the whole time of service.  An unlucky turn of the head would\nsuffice to arrest their attention.  ‘Who is that?’ they would think:\n‘surely I should know him!’ and, a church being the place in all the\nworld where one has least to think of, it was ten to one they would end\nby remembering me before the benediction.  However, my mind was made up:\nI thanked my obliging friend, and placed myself at his disposal.\n\nOur way now led us into the north-east quarter of the town, among\npleasant new faubourgs, to a decent new church of a good size, where I\nwas soon seated by the side of my good Samaritan, and looked upon by a\nwhole congregation of menacing faces.  At first the possibility of danger\nkept me awake; but by the time I had assured myself there was none to be\napprehended, and the service was not in the least likely to be enlivened\nby the arrest of a French spy, I had to resign myself to the task of\nlistening to Dr. Henry Gray.\n\nAs we moved out, after this ordeal was over, my friend was at once\nsurrounded and claimed by his acquaintances of the congregation; and I\nwas rejoiced to hear him addressed by the expected name of Robbie.\n\nSo soon as we were clear of the crowd—‘Mr. Robbie?’ said I, bowing.\n\n‘The very same, sir,’ said he.\n\n‘If I mistake not, a lawyer?’\n\n‘A writer to His Majesty’s Signet, at your service.’\n\n‘It seems we were predestined to be acquaintances!’ I exclaimed.  ‘I have\nhere a card in my pocket intended for you.  It is from my family lawyer.\nIt was his last word, as I was leaving, to ask to be remembered kindly,\nand to trust you would pass over so informal an introduction.’\n\nAnd I offered him the card.\n\n‘Ay, ay, my old friend Daniel!’ says he, looking on the card.  ‘And how\ndoes my old friend Daniel?’\n\nI gave a favourable view of Mr. Romaine’s health.\n\n‘Well, this is certainly a whimsical incident,’ he continued.  ‘And since\nwe are thus met already—and so much to my advantage!—the simplest thing\nwill be to prosecute the acquaintance instantly.  Let me propose a snack\nbetween sermons, a bottle of my particular green seal—and when nobody is\nlooking we can talk blazons, Mr. Ducie!’—which was the name I then used\nand had already incidentally mentioned, in the vain hope of provoking a\nreturn in kind.\n\n‘I beg your pardon, sir: do I understand you to invite me to your house?’\nsaid I.\n\n‘That was the idea I was trying to convey,’ said he.  ‘We have the name\nof hospitable people up here, and I would like you to try mine.’\n\n‘Mr. Robbie, I shall hope to try it some day, but not yet,’ I replied.\n‘I hope you will not misunderstand me.  My business, which brings me to\nyour city, is of a peculiar kind.  Till you shall have heard it, and,\nindeed, till its issue is known, I should feel as if I had stolen your\ninvitation.’\n\n‘Well, well,’ said he, a little sobered, ‘it must be as you wish, though\nyou would hardly speak otherwise if you had committed homicide!  Mine is\nthe loss.  I must eat alone; a very pernicious thing for a person of my\nhabit of body, content myself with a pint of skinking claret, and\nmeditate the discourse.  But about this business of yours: if it is so\nparticular as all that, it will doubtless admit of no delay.’\n\n‘I must confess, sir, it presses,’ I acknowledged.\n\n‘Then, let us say to-morrow at half-past eight in the morning,’ said he;\n‘and I hope, when your mind is at rest (and it does you much honour to\ntake it as you do), that you will sit down with me to the postponed meal,\nnot forgetting the bottle.  You have my address?’ he added, and gave it\nme—which was the only thing I wanted.\n\nAt last, at the level of York Place, we parted with mutual civilities,\nand I was free to pursue my way, through the mobs of people returning\nfrom church, to my lodgings in St. James’ Square.\n\nAlmost at the house door whom should I overtake but my landlady in a\ndress of gorgeous severity, and dragging a prize in her wake: no less\nthan Rowley, with the cockade in his hat, and a smart pair of tops to his\nboots!  When I said he was in the lady’s wake I spoke but in metaphor.\nAs a matter of fact he was squiring her, with the utmost dignity, on his\narm; and I followed them up the stairs, smiling to myself.\n\nBoth were quick to salute me as soon as I was perceived, and Mrs.\nMcRankine inquired where I had been.  I told her boastfully, giving her\nthe name of the church and the divine, and ignorantly supposing I should\nhave gained caste.  But she soon opened my eyes.  In the roots of the\nScottish character there are knots and contortions that not only no\nstranger can understand, but no stranger can follow; he walks among\nexplosives; and his best course is to throw himself upon their\nmercy—‘Just as I am, without one plea,’ a citation from one of the lady’s\nfavourite hymns.\n\nThe sound she made was unmistakable in meaning, though it was impossible\nto be written down; and I at once executed the manoeuvre I have\nrecommended.\n\n‘You must remember I am a perfect stranger in your city,’ said I.  ‘If I\nhave done wrong, it was in mere ignorance, my dear lady; and this\nafternoon, if you will be so good as to take me, I shall accompany\n_you_.’\n\nBut she was not to be pacified at the moment, and departed to her own\nquarters murmuring.\n\n‘Well, Rowley,’ said I; ‘and have you been to church?’\n\n‘If you please, sir,’ he said.\n\n‘Well, you have not been any less unlucky than I have,’ I returned.  ‘And\nhow did you get on with the Scottish form?’\n\n‘Well, sir, it was pretty ’ard, the form was, and reether narrow,’ he\nreplied.  ‘I don’t know w’y it is, but it seems to me like as if things\nwere a good bit changed since William Wallace!  That was a main queer\nchurch she took me to, Mr. Anne!  I don’t know as I could have sat it\nout, if she ’adn’t ’a’ give me peppermints.  She ain’t a bad one at\nbottom, the old girl; she do pounce a bit, and she do worry, but, law\nbless you, Mr. Anne, it ain’t nothink really—she don’t _mean_ it.  W’y,\nshe was down on me like a ’undredweight of bricks this morning.  You see,\nlast night she ’ad me in to supper, and, I beg your pardon, sir, but I\ntook the freedom of playing her a chune or two.  She didn’t mind a bit;\nso this morning I began to play to myself, and she flounced in, and flew\nup, and carried on no end about Sunday!’\n\n‘You see, Rowley,’ said I, ‘they’re all mad up here, and you have to\nhumour them.  See and don’t quarrel with Mrs. McRankine; and, above all,\ndon’t argue with her, or you’ll get the worst of it.  Whatever she says,\ntouch your forelock and say, “If you please!” or “I beg pardon, ma’am.”\nAnd let me tell you one thing: I am sorry, but you have to go to church\nwith her again this afternoon.  That’s duty, my boy!’\n\nAs I had foreseen, the bells had scarce begun before Mrs. McRankine\npresented herself to be our escort, upon which I sprang up with readiness\nand offered her my arm.  Rowley followed behind.  I was beginning to grow\naccustomed to the risks of my stay in Edinburgh, and it even amused me to\nconfront a new churchful.  I confess the amusement did not last until the\nend; for if Dr. Gray were long, Mr. McCraw was not only longer, but more\nincoherent, and the matter of his sermon (which was a direct attack,\napparently, on all the Churches of the world, my own among the number),\nwhere it had not the tonic quality of personal insult, rather inclined me\nto slumber.  But I braced myself for my life, kept up Rowley with the end\nof a pin, and came through it awake, but no more.\n\nBethiah was quite conquered by this ‘mark of grace,’ though, I am afraid,\nshe was also moved by more worldly considerations.  The first is, the\nlady had not the least objection to go to church on the arm of an\nelegantly dressed young gentleman, and be followed by a spruce servant\nwith a cockade in his hat.  I could see it by the way she took possession\nof us, found us the places in the Bible, whispered to me the name of the\nminister, passed us lozenges, which I (for my part) handed on to Rowley,\nand at each fresh attention stole a little glance about the church to\nmake sure she was observed.  Rowley was a pretty boy; you will pardon me\nif I also remembered that I was a favourable-looking young man.  When we\ngrow elderly, how the room brightens, and begins to look as it ought to\nlook, on the entrance of youth, grace, health, and comeliness!  You do\nnot want them for yourself, perhaps not even for your son, but you look\non smiling; and when you recall their images—again, it is with a smile.\nI defy you to see or think of them and not smile with an infinite and\nintimate, but quite impersonal, pleasure.  Well, either I know nothing of\nwomen, or that was the case with Bethiah McRankine.  She had been to\nchurch with a cockade behind her, on the one hand; on the other, her\nhouse was brightened by the presence of a pair of good-looking young\nfellows of the other sex, who were always pleased and deferential in her\nsociety and accepted her views as final.\n\nThese were sentiments to be encouraged; and, on the way home from\nchurch—if church it could be called—I adopted a most insidious device to\nmagnify her interest.  I took her into the confidence, that is, of my\nlove affair, and I had no sooner mentioned a young lady with whom my\naffections were engaged than she turned upon me a face of awful gravity.\n\n‘Is she bonny?’ she inquired.\n\nI gave her full assurances upon that.\n\n‘To what denoamination does she beloang?’ came next, and was so\nunexpected as almost to deprive me of breath.\n\n‘Upon my word, ma’am, I have never inquired,’ cried I; ‘I only know that\nshe is a heartfelt Christian, and that is enough.’\n\n‘Ay!’ she sighed, ‘if she has the root of the maitter!  There’s a remnant\npractically in most of the denoaminations.  There’s some in the\nMcGlashanites, and some in the Glassites, and mony in the McMillanites,\nand there’s a leeven even in the Estayblishment.’\n\n‘I have known some very good Papists even, if you go to that,’ said I.\n\n‘Mr. Ducie, think shame to yoursel’!’ she cried.\n\n‘Why, my dear madam!  I only—’ I began.\n\n‘You shouldnae jest in sairious maitters,’ she interrupted.\n\nOn the whole, she entered into what I chose to tell her of our idyll with\navidity, like a cat licking her whiskers over a dish of cream; and,\nstrange to say—and so expansive a passion is that of love!—that I derived\na perhaps equal satisfaction from confiding in that breast of iron.  It\nmade an immediate bond: from that hour we seemed to be welded into a\nfamily-party; and I had little difficulty in persuading her to join us\nand to preside over our tea-table.  Surely there was never so ill-matched\na trio as Rowley, Mrs. McRankine, and the Viscount Anne!  But I am of the\nApostle’s way, with a difference: all things to all women!  When I cannot\nplease a woman, hang me in my cravat!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII—EVENTS OF MONDAY: THE LAWYER’S PARTY\n\n\nBy half-past eight o’clock on the next morning, I was ringing the bell of\nthe lawyer’s office in Castle Street, where I found him ensconced at a\nbusiness table, in a room surrounded by several tiers of green tin cases.\nHe greeted me like an old friend.\n\n‘Come away, sir, come away!’ said he.  ‘Here is the dentist ready for\nyou, and I think I can promise you that the operation will be practically\npainless.’\n\n‘I am not so sure of that, Mr. Robbie,’ I replied, as I shook hands with\nhim.  ‘But at least there shall be no time lost with me.’\n\nI had to confess to having gone a-roving with a pair of drovers and their\ncattle, to having used a false name, to having murdered or half-murdered\na fellow-creature in a scuffle on the moors, and to having suffered a\ncouple of quite innocent men to lie some time in prison on a charge from\nwhich I could have immediately freed them.  All this I gave him first of\nall, to be done with the worst of it; and all this he took with gravity,\nbut without the least appearance of surprise.\n\n‘Now, sir,’ I continued, ‘I expect to have to pay for my unhappy frolic,\nbut I would like very well if it could be managed without my personal\nappearance or even the mention of my real name.  I had so much wisdom as\nto sail under false colours in this foolish jaunt of mine; my family\nwould be extremely concerned if they had wind of it; but at the same\ntime, if the case of this Faa has terminated fatally, and there are\nproceedings against Todd and Candlish, I am not going to stand by and see\nthem vexed, far less punished; and I authorise you to give me up for\ntrial if you think that best—or, if you think it unnecessary, in the\nmeanwhile to make preparations for their defence.  I hope, sir, that I am\nas little anxious to be Quixotic, as I am determined to be just.’\n\n‘Very fairly spoken,’ said Mr. Robbie.  ‘It is not much in my line, as\ndoubtless your friend, Mr. Romaine, will have told you.  I rarely mix\nmyself up with anything on the criminal side, or approaching it.\nHowever, for a young gentleman like you, I may stretch a point, and I\ndare say I may be able to accomplish more than perhaps another.  I will\ngo at once to the Procurator Fiscal’s office and inquire.’\n\n‘Wait a moment, Mr. Robbie,’ said I.  ‘You forget the chapter of\nexpenses.  I had thought, for a beginning, of placing a thousand pounds\nin your hands.’\n\n‘My dear sir, you will kindly wait until I render you my bill,’ said Mr.\nRobbie severely.’\n\n‘It seemed to me,’ I protested, ‘that coming to you almost as a stranger,\nand placing in your hands a piece of business so contrary to your habits,\nsome substantial guarantee of my good faith—’\n\n‘Not the way that we do business in Scotland, sir,’ he interrupted, with\nan air of closing the dispute.\n\n‘And yet, Mr. Robbie,’ I continued, ‘I must ask you to allow me to\nproceed.  I do not merely refer to the expenses of the case.  I have my\neye besides on Todd and Candlish.  They are thoroughly deserving fellows;\nthey have been subjected through me to a considerable term of\nimprisonment; and I suggest, sir, that you should not spare money for\ntheir indemnification.  This will explain,’ I added smiling, ‘my offer of\nthe thousand pounds.  It was in the nature of a measure by which you\nshould judge the scale on which I can afford to have this business\ncarried through.’\n\n‘I take you perfectly, Mr. Ducie,’ said he.  ‘But the sooner I am off,\nthe better this affair is like to be guided.  My clerk will show you into\nthe waiting-room and give you the day’s _Caledonian Mercury_ and the last\n_Register_ to amuse yourself with in the interval.’\n\nI believe Mr. Robbie was at least three hours gone.  I saw him descend\nfrom a cab at the door, and almost immediately after I was shown again\ninto his study, where the solemnity of his manner led me to augur the\nworst.  For some time he had the inhumanity to read me a lecture as to\nthe incredible silliness, ‘not to say immorality,’ of my behaviour.  ‘I\nhave the satisfaction in telling you my opinion, because it appears that\nyou are going to get off scot free,’ he continued, where, indeed, I\nthought he might have begun.\n\n‘The man, Faa, has been discharged cured; and the two men, Todd and\nCandlish, would have been leeberated lone ago if it had not been for\ntheir extraordinary loyalty to yourself, Mr. Ducie—or Mr. St. Ivey, as I\nbelieve I should now call you.  Never a word would either of the two old\nfools volunteer that in any manner pointed at the existence of such a\nperson; and when they were confronted with Faa’s version of the affair,\nthey gave accounts so entirely discrepant with their own former\ndeclarations, as well as with each other, that the Fiscal was quite\nnonplussed, and imaigined there was something behind it.  You may believe\nI soon laughed him out of that!  And I had the satisfaction of seeing\nyour two friends set free, and very glad to be on the causeway again.’\n\n‘Oh, sir,’ I cried, ‘you should have brought them here.’\n\n‘No instructions, Mr. Ducie!’ said he.  ‘How did I know you wished to\nrenew an acquaintance which you had just terminated so fortunately?  And,\nindeed, to be frank with you, I should have set my face against it, if\nyou had!  Let them go!  They are paid and contented, and have the highest\npossible opinion of Mr. St. Ivey!  When I gave them fifty pounds\napiece—which was rather more than enough, Mr. Ducie, whatever you may\nthink—the man Todd, who has the only tongue of the party, struck his\nstaff on the ground.  “Weel,” says he, “I aye said he was a gentleman!”\n“Man, Todd,” said I, “that was just what Mr St. Ivey said of yourself!”’\n\n‘So it was a case of “Compliments fly when gentlefolk meet.”’\n\n‘No, no, Mr. Ducie, man Todd and man Candlish are gone out of your life,\nand a good riddance!  They are fine fellows in their way, but no proper\nassociates for the like of yourself; and do you finally agree to be done\nwith all eccentricity—take up with no more drovers, or tinkers, but enjoy\nthe naitural pleesures for which your age, your wealth, your\nintelligence, and (if I may be allowed to say it) your appearance so\ncompletely fit you.  And the first of these,’ quoth he, looking at his\nwatch, ‘will be to step through to my dining-room and share a bachelor’s\nluncheon.’\n\nOver the meal, which was good, Mr. Robbie continued to develop the same\ntheme.  ‘You’re, no doubt, what they call a dancing-man?’ said he.\n‘Well, on Thursday night there is the Assembly Ball.  You must certainly\ngo there, and you must permit me besides to do the honours of the ceety\nand send you a ticket.  I am a thorough believer in a young man being a\nyoung man—but no more drovers or rovers, if you love me!  Talking of\nwhich puts me in mind that you may be short of partners at the\nAssembly—oh, I have been young myself!—and if ye care to come to anything\nso portentiously tedious as a tea-party at the house of a bachelor\nlawyer, consisting mainly of his nieces and nephews, and his grand-nieces\nand grand-nephews, and his wards, and generally the whole clan of the\ndescendants of his clients, you might drop in to-night towards seven\no’clock.  I think I can show you one or two that are worth looking at,\nand you can dance with them later on at the Assembly.’\n\nHe proceeded to give me a sketch of one or two eligible young ladies’\nwhom I might expect to meet.  ‘And then there’s my parteecular friend,\nMiss Flora,’ said he.  ‘But I’ll make no attempt of a description.  You\nshall see her for yourself.’\n\nIt will be readily supposed that I accepted his invitation; and returned\nhome to make a toilette worthy of her I was to meet and the good news of\nwhich I was the bearer.  The toilette, I have reason to believe, was a\nsuccess.  Mr. Rowley dismissed me with a farewell: ‘Crikey!  Mr. Anne,\nbut you do look prime!’  Even the stony Bethiah was—how shall I\nsay?—dazzled, but scandalised, by my appearance; and while, of course,\nshe deplored the vanity that led to it, she could not wholly prevent\nherself from admiring the result.\n\n‘Ay, Mr. Ducie, this is a poor employment for a wayfaring Christian man!’\nshe said.  ‘Wi’ Christ despised and rejectit in all pairts of the world\nand the flag of the Covenant flung doon, you will be muckle better on\nyour knees!  However, I’ll have to confess that it sets you weel.  And if\nit’s the lassie ye’re gaun to see the nicht, I suppose I’ll just have to\nexcuse ye!  Bairns maun be bairns!’ she said, with a sigh.  ‘I mind when\nMr. McRankine came courtin’, and that’s lang by-gane—I mind I had a green\ngown, passementit, that was thocht to become me to admiration.  I was nae\njust exactly what ye would ca’ bonny; but I was pale, penetratin’, and\ninterestin’.’  And she leaned over the stair-rail with a candle to watch\nmy descent as long as it should be possible.\n\nIt was but a little party at Mr. Robbie’s—by which, I do not so much mean\nthat there were few people, for the rooms were crowded, as that there was\nvery little attempted to entertain them.  In one apartment there were\ntables set out, where the elders were solemnly engaged upon whist; in the\nother and larger one, a great number of youth of both sexes entertained\nthemselves languidly, the ladies sitting upon chairs to be courted, the\ngentlemen standing about in various attitudes of insinuation or\nindifference.  Conversation appeared the sole resource, except in so far\nas it was modified by a number of keepsakes and annuals which lay\ndispersed upon the tables, and of which the young beaux displayed the\nillustrations to the ladies.  Mr. Robbie himself was customarily in the\ncard-room; only now and again, when he cut out, he made an incursion\namong the young folks, and rolled about jovially from one to another, the\nvery picture of the general uncle.\n\nIt chanced that Flora had met Mr. Robbie in the course of the afternoon.\n‘Now, Miss Flora,’ he had said, ‘come early, for I have a Phoenix to show\nyou—one Mr. Ducie, a new client of mine that, I vow, I have fallen in\nlove with’; and he was so good as to add a word or two on my appearance,\nfrom which Flora conceived a suspicion of the truth.  She had come to the\nparty, in consequence, on the knife-edge of anticipation and alarm; had\nchosen a place by the door, where I found her, on my arrival, surrounded\nby a posse of vapid youths; and, when I drew near, sprang up to meet me\nin the most natural manner in the world, and, obviously, with a prepared\nform of words.\n\n‘How do you do, Mr. Ducie?’ she said.  ‘It is quite an age since I have\nseen you!’\n\n‘I have much to tell you, Miss Gilchrist,’ I replied.  ‘May I sit down?’\n\nFor the artful girl, by sitting near the door, and the judicious use of\nher shawl, had contrived to keep a chair empty by her side.\n\nShe made room for me, as a matter of course, and the youths had the\ndiscretion to melt before us.  As soon as I was once seated her fan flew\nout, and she whispered behind it:\n\n‘Are you mad?’\n\n‘Madly in love,’ I replied; ‘but in no other sense.’\n\n‘I have no patience!  You cannot understand what I am suffering!’ she\nsaid.  ‘What are you to say to Ronald, to Major Chevenix, to my aunt?’\n\nYour aunt?’ I cried, with a start.  ‘_Peccavi_! is she here?’\n\n‘She is in the card-room at whist,’ said Flora.\n\n‘Where she will probably stay all the evening?’ I suggested.\n\n‘She may,’ she admitted; ‘she generally does!’\n\n‘Well, then, I must avoid the card-room,’ said I, ‘which is very much\nwhat I had counted upon doing.  I did not come here to play cards, but to\ncontemplate a certain young lady to my heart’s content—if it can ever be\ncontented!—and to tell her some good news.’\n\n‘But there are still Ronald and the Major!’ she persisted.  ‘They are not\ncard-room fixtures!  Ronald will be coming and going.  And as for Mr.\nChevenix, he—’\n\n‘Always sits with Miss Flora?’ I interrupted.  ‘And they talk of poor St.\nIves?  I had gathered as much, my dear; and Mr. Ducie has come to prevent\nit!  But pray dismiss these fears!  I mind no one but your aunt.’\n\n‘Why my aunt?’\n\n‘Because your aunt is a lady, my dear, and a very clever lady, and, like\nall clever ladies, a very rash lady,’ said I.  ‘You can never count upon\nthem, unless you are sure of getting them in a corner, as I have got you,\nand talking them over rationally, as I am just engaged on with yourself!\nIt would be quite the same to your aunt to make the worst kind of a\nscandal, with an equal indifference to my danger and to the feelings of\nour good host!’\n\n‘Well,’ she said, ‘and what of Ronald, then?  Do you think _he_ is above\nmaking a scandal?  You must know him very little!’\n\n‘On the other hand, it is my pretension that I know him very well!’ I\nreplied.  ‘I must speak to Ronald first—not Ronald to me—that is all!’\n\n‘Then, please, go and speak to him at once!’ she pleaded.  He is there—do\nyou see?—at the upper end of the room, talking to that girl in pink.’\n\n‘And so lose this seat before I have told you my good news?’ I exclaimed.\n‘Catch me!  And, besides, my dear one, think a little of me and my good\nnews!  I thought the bearer of good news was always welcome!  I hoped he\nmight be a little welcome for himself!  Consider!  I have but one friend;\nand let me stay by her!  And there is only one thing I care to hear; and\nlet me hear it!’\n\n‘Oh, Anne,’ she sighed, ‘if I did not love you, why should I be so\nuneasy?  I am turned into a coward, dear!  Think, if it were the other\nway round—if you were quite safe and I was in, oh, such danger!’\n\nShe had no sooner said it than I was convicted of being a dullard.  ‘God\nforgive me, dear!’  I made haste to reply.  ‘I never saw before that\nthere were two sides to this!’  And I told her my tale as briefly as I\ncould, and rose to seek Ronald.  ‘You see, my dear, you are obeyed,’ I\nsaid.\n\nShe gave me a look that was a reward in itself; and as I turned away from\nher, with a strong sense of turning away from the sun, I carried that\nlook in my bosom like a caress.  The girl in pink was an arch, ogling\nperson, with a good deal of eyes and teeth, and a great play of shoulders\nand rattle of conversation.  There could be no doubt, from Mr. Ronald’s\nattitude, that he worshipped the very chair she sat on.  But I was quite\nruthless.  I laid my hand on his shoulder, as he was stooping over her\nlike a hen over a chicken.\n\n‘Excuse me for one moment, Mr. Gilchrist!’ said I.\n\nHe started and span about in answer to my touch, and exhibited a face of\ninarticulate wonder.\n\n ‘Yes!’ I continued, ‘it is even myself!  Pardon me for interrupting so\nagreeable a _tête-à-tête_, but you know, my good fellow, we owe a first\nduty to Mr. Robbie.  It would never do to risk making a scene in the\nman’s drawing-room; so the first thing I had to attend to was to have you\nwarned.  The name I go by is Ducie, too, in case of accidents.’\n\n‘I—I say, you know!’ cried Ronald.  ‘Deuce take it, what are you doing\nhere?’\n\n‘Hush, hush!’ said I.  ‘Not the place, my dear fellow—not the place.\nCome to my rooms, if you like, to-night after the party, or to-morrow in\nthe morning, and we can talk it out over a segar.  But here, you know, it\nreally won’t do at all.’\n\nBefore he could collect his mind for an answer, I had given him my\naddress in St. James Square, and had again mingled with the crowd.  Alas!\nI was not fated to get back to Flora so easily!  Mr. Robbie was in the\npath: he was insatiably loquacious; and as he continued to palaver I\nwatched the insipid youths gather again about my idol, and cursed my fate\nand my host.  He remembered suddenly that I was to attend the Assembly\nBall on Thursday, and had only attended to-night by way of a preparative.\nThis put it into his head to present me to another young lady; but I\nmanaged this interview with so much art that, while I was scrupulously\npolite and even cordial to the fair one, I contrived to keep Robbie\nbeside me all the time and to leave along with him when the ordeal was\nover.  We were just walking away arm in arm, when I spied my friend the\nMajor approaching, stiff as a ramrod and, as usual, obtrusively clean.\n\n‘Oh! there’s a man I want to know,’ said I, taking the bull by the horns.\n‘Won’t you introduce me to Major Chevenix?’\n\n‘At a word, my dear fellow,’ said Robbie; and ‘Major!’ he cried, ‘come\nhere and let me present to you my friend Mr. Ducie, who desires the\nhonour of your acquaintance.’\n\nThe Major flushed visibly, but otherwise preserved his composure.  He\nbowed very low.  ‘I’m not very sure,’ he said: ‘I have an idea we have\nmet before?’\n\n‘Informally,’ I said, returning his bow; ‘and I have long looked forward\nto the pleasure of regularising our acquaintance.’\n\n‘You are very good, Mr. Ducie,’ he returned.  ‘Perhaps you could aid my\nmemory a little?  Where was it that I had the pleasure?’\n\n‘Oh, that would be telling tales out of school,’ said I, with a laugh,\n‘and before my lawyer, too!’\n\n‘I’ll wager,’ broke in Mr. Robbie, ‘that, when you knew my client,\nChevenix—the past of our friend Mr. Ducie is an obscure chapter full of\nhorrid secrets—I’ll wager, now, you knew him as St. Ivey,’ says he,\nnudging me violently.\n\n‘I think not, sir,’ said the Major, with pinched lips.\n\n‘Well, I wish he may prove all right!’ continued the lawyer, with\ncertainly the worst-inspired jocularity in the world.  ‘I know nothing by\nhim!  He may be a swell mobsman for me with his aliases.  You must put\nyour memory on the rack, Major, and when ye’ve remembered when and where\nye met him, be sure ye tell me.’\n\n‘I will not fail, sir,’ said Chevenix.\n\n‘Seek to him!’ cried Robbie, waving his hand as he departed.\n\nThe Major, as soon as we were alone, turned upon me his impassive\ncountenance.\n\n‘Well,’ he said, ‘you have courage.’\n\n‘It is undoubted as your honour, sir,’ I returned, bowing.\n\n‘Did you expect to meet me, may I ask?’ said he.\n\n‘You saw, at least, that I courted the presentation,’ said I.\n\n‘And you were not afraid?’ said Chevenix.\n\n‘I was perfectly at ease.  I knew I was dealing with a gentleman.  Be\nthat your epitaph.’\n\n‘Well, there are some other people looking for you,’ he said, ‘who will\nmake no bones about the point of honour.  The police, my dear sir, are\nsimply agog about you.’\n\n‘And I think that that was coarse,’ said I.\n\n‘You have seen Miss Gilchrist?’ he inquired, changing the subject.\n\n‘With whom, I am led to understand, we are on a footing of rivalry?’ I\nasked.  ‘Yes, I have seen her.’\n\n‘And I was just seeking her,’ he replied.\n\nI was conscious of a certain thrill of temper; so, I suppose, was he.  We\nlooked each other up and down.\n\n‘The situation is original,’ he resumed.\n\n‘Quite,’ said I.  ‘But let me tell you frankly you are blowing a cold\ncoal.  I owe you so much for your kindness to the prisoner Champdivers.’\n\n‘Meaning that the lady’s affections are more advantageously disposed of?’\nhe asked, with a sneer.  ‘Thank you, I am sure.  And, since you have\ngiven me a lead, just hear a word of good advice in your turn.  Is it\nfair, is it delicate, is it like a gentleman, to compromise the young\nlady by attentions which (as you know very well) can come to nothing?’\n\nI was utterly unable to find words in answer.\n\n‘Excuse me if I cut this interview short,’ he went on.  ‘It seems to me\ndoomed to come to nothing, and there is more attractive metal.’\n\n‘Yes,’ I replied, ‘as you say, it cannot amount to much.  You are\nimpotent, bound hand and foot in honour.  You know me to be a man falsely\naccused, and even if you did not know it, from your position as my rival\nyou have only the choice to stand quite still or to be infamous.’\n\n‘I would not say that,’ he returned, with another change of colour.  ‘I\nmay hear it once too often.’\n\nWith which he moved off straight for where Flora was sitting amidst her\ncourt of vapid youths, and I had no choice but to follow him, a bad\nsecond, and reading myself, as I went, a sharp lesson on the command of\ntemper.\n\nIt is a strange thing how young men in their teens go down at the mere\nwind of the coming of men of twenty-five and upwards!  The vapid ones\nfled without thought of resistance before the Major and me; a few dallied\nawhile in the neighbourhood—so to speak, with their fingers in their\nmouths—but presently these also followed the rout, and we remained face\nto face before Flora.  There was a draught in that corner by the door;\nshe had thrown her pelisse over her bare arms and neck, and the dark fur\nof the trimming set them off.  She shone by contrast; the light played on\nher smooth skin to admiration, and the colour changed in her excited\nface.  For the least fraction of a second she looked from one to the\nother of her pair of rival swains, and seemed to hesitate.  Then she\naddressed Chevenix:—\n\n‘You are coming to the Assembly, of course, Major Chevenix?’ said she.\n\n‘I fear not; I fear I shall be otherwise engaged,’ he replied.  ‘Even the\npleasure of dancing with you, Miss Flora, must give way to duty.’\n\nFor awhile the talk ran harmlessly on the weather, and then branched off\ntowards the war.  It seemed to be by no one’s fault; it was in the air,\nand had to come.\n\n‘Good news from the scene of operations,’ said the Major.\n\n‘Good news while it lasts,’ I said.  ‘But will Miss Gilchrist tell us her\nprivate thought upon the war?  In her admiration for the victors, does\nnot there mingle some pity for the vanquished?’\n\n‘Indeed, sir,’ she said, with animation, ‘only too much of it!  War is a\nsubject that I do not think should be talked of to a girl.  I am, I have\nto be—what do you call it?—a non-combatant?  And to remind me of what\nothers have to do and suffer: no, it is not fair!’\n\n‘Miss Gilchrist has the tender female heart,’ said Chevenix.\n\n‘Do not be too sure of that!’ she cried.  ‘I would love to be allowed to\nfight myself!’\n\n‘On which side?’ I asked.\n\n‘Can you ask?’ she exclaimed.  ‘I am a Scottish girl!’\n\n‘She is a Scottish girl!’ repeated the Major, looking at me.  ‘And no one\ngrudges you her pity!’\n\n‘And I glory in every grain of it she has to spare,’ said I.  ‘Pity is\nakin to love.’\n\n‘Well, and let us put that question to Miss Gilchrist.  It is for her to\ndecide, and for us to bow to the decision.  Is pity, Miss Flora, or is\nadmiration, nearest love?’\n\n‘Oh come,’ said I, ‘let us be more concrete.  Lay before the lady a\ncomplete case: describe your man, then I’ll describe _mine_, and Miss\nFlora shall decide.’\n\n‘I think I see your meaning,’ said he, ‘and I’ll try.  You think that\npity—and the kindred sentiments—have the greatest power upon the heart.\nI think more nobly of women.  To my view, the man they love will first of\nall command their respect; he will be steadfast—proud, if you please;\ndry, possibly—but of all things steadfast.  They will look at him in\ndoubt; at last they will see that stern face which he presents to all the\nrest of the world soften to them alone.  First, trust, I say.  It is so\nthat a woman loves who is worthy of heroes.’\n\n‘Your man is very ambitious, sir,’ said I, ‘and very much of a hero!\nMine is a humbler, and, I would fain think, a more human dog.  He is one\nwith no particular trust in himself, with no superior steadfastness to be\nadmired for, who sees a lady’s face, who hears her voice, and, without\nany phrase about the matter, falls in love.  What does he ask for, then,\nbut pity?—pity for his weakness, pity for his love, which is his life.\nYou would make women always the inferiors, gaping up at your imaginary\nlover; he, like a marble statue, with his nose in the air!  But God has\nbeen wiser than you; and the most steadfast of your heroes may prove\nhuman, after all.  We appeal to the queen for judgment,’ I added, turning\nand bowing before Flora.\n\n‘And how shall the queen judge?’ she asked.  ‘I must give you an answer\nthat is no answer at all.  “The wind bloweth where it listeth”: she goes\nwhere her heart goes.’\n\nHer face flushed as she said it; mine also, for I read in it a\ndeclaration, and my heart swelled for joy.  But Chevenix grew pale.\n\n‘You make of life a very dreadful kind of lottery, ma’am,’ said he.  ‘But\nI will not despair.  Honest and unornamental is still my choice.’\n\nAnd I must say he looked extremely handsome and very amusingly like the\nmarble statue with its nose in the air to which I had compared him.\n\n‘I cannot imagine how we got upon this subject,’ said Flora.\n\n‘Madame, it was through the war,’ replied Chevenix.\n\n‘All roads lead to Rome,’ I commented.  ‘What else would you expect Mr.\nChevenix and myself to talk of?’\n\nAbout this time I was conscious of a certain bustle and movement in the\nroom behind me, but did not pay to it that degree of attention which\nperhaps would have been wise.  There came a certain change in Flora’s\nface; she signalled repeatedly with her fan; her eyes appealed to me\nobsequiously; there could be no doubt that she wanted something—as well\nas I could make out, that I should go away and leave the field clear for\nmy rival, which I had not the least idea of doing.  At last she rose from\nher chair with impatience.\n\n‘I think it time you were saying good-night, Mr Ducie!’ she said.\n\nI could not in the least see why, and said so.\n\nWhereupon she gave me this appalling answer, ‘My aunt is coming out of\nthe card-room.’\n\nIn less time than it takes to tell, I had made my bow and my escape.\nLooking back from the doorway, I was privileged to see, for a moment, the\naugust profile and gold eyeglasses of Miss Gilchrist issuing from the\ncard-room; and the sight lent me wings.  I stood not on the order of my\ngoing; and a moment after, I was on the pavement of Castle Street, and\nthe lighted windows shone down on me, and were crossed by ironical\nshadows of those who had remained behind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX—EVENTS OF TUESDAY: THE TOILS CLOSING\n\n\nThis day began with a surprise.  I found a letter on my breakfast-table\naddressed to Edward Ducie, Esquire; and at first I was startled beyond\nmeasure.  ‘Conscience doth make cowards of us all!’  When I had opened\nit, it proved to be only a note from the lawyer, enclosing a card for the\nAssembly Ball on Thursday evening.  Shortly after, as I was composing my\nmind with a segar at one of the windows of the sitting-room, and Rowley,\nhaving finished the light share of work that fell to him, sat not far off\ntootling with great spirit and a marked preference for the upper octave,\nRonald was suddenly shown in.  I got him a segar, drew in a chair to the\nside of the fire, and installed him there—I was going to say, at his\nease, but no expression could be farther from the truth.  He was plainly\non pins and needles, did not know whether to take or to refuse the segar,\nand, after he had taken it, did not know whether to light or to return\nit.  I saw he had something to say; I did not think it was his own\nsomething; and I was ready to offer a large bet it was really something\nof Major Chevenix’s.\n\n‘Well, and so here you are!’ I observed, with pointless cordiality, for I\nwas bound I should do nothing to help him out.  If he were, indeed, here\nrunning errands for my rival, he might have a fair field, but certainly\nno favour.\n\n‘The fact is,’ he began, ‘I would rather see you alone.’\n\n‘Why, certainly,’ I replied.  ‘Rowley, you can step into the bedroom.  My\ndear fellow,’ I continued, ‘this sounds serious.  Nothing wrong, I\ntrust.’\n\n‘Well, I’ll be quite honest,’ said he.  ‘I _am_ a good deal bothered.’\n\n‘And I bet I know why!’ I exclaimed.  ‘And I bet I can put you to rights,\ntoo!’\n\n‘What do you mean!’ he asked.\n\n‘You must be hard up,’ said I, ‘and all I can say is, you’ve come to the\nright place.  If you have the least use for a hundred pounds, or any such\ntrifling sum as that, please mention it.  It’s here, quite at your\nservice.’\n\n‘I am sure it is most kind of you,’ said Ronald, ‘and the truth is,\nthough I can’t think how you guessed it, that I really _am_ a little\nbehind board.  But I haven’t come to talk about that.’\n\n‘No, I dare say!’ cried I.  ‘Not worth talking about!  But remember,\nRonald, you and I are on different sides of the business.  Remember that\nyou did me one of those services that make men friends for ever.  And\nsince I have had the fortune to come into a fair share of money, just\noblige me, and consider so much of it as your own.’\n\n‘No,’ he said, ‘I couldn’t take it; I couldn’t, really.  Besides, the\nfact is, I’ve come on a very different matter.  It’s about my sister, St.\nIves,’ and he shook his head menacingly at me.\n\n‘You’re quite sure?’ I persisted.  ‘It’s here, at your service—up to five\nhundred pounds, if you like.  Well, all right; only remember where it is,\nwhen you do want it.’\n\n‘Oh, please let me alone!’ cried Ronald: ‘I’ve come to say something\nunpleasant; and how on earth can I do it, if you don’t give a fellow a\nchance?  It’s about my sister, as I said.  You can see for yourself that\nit can’t be allowed to go on.  It’s compromising; it don’t lead to\nanything; and you’re not the kind of man (you must feel it yourself) that\nI can allow my female relatives to have anything to do with.  I hate\nsaying this, St. Ives; it looks like hitting a man when he’s down, you\nknow; and I told the Major I very much disliked it from the first.\nHowever, it had to be said; and now it has been, and, between gentlemen,\nit shouldn’t be necessary to refer to it again.’\n\n‘It’s compromising; it doesn’t lead to anything; not the kind of man,’ I\nrepeated thoughtfully.  ‘Yes, I believe I understand, and shall make\nhaste to put myself _en règle_.’  I stood up, and laid my segar down.\n‘Mr. Gilchrist,’ said I, with a bow, ‘in answer to your very natural\nobservations, I beg to offer myself as a suitor for your sister’s hand.\nI am a man of title, of which we think lightly in France, but of ancient\nlineage, which is everywhere prized.  I can display thirty-two\nquarterings without a blot.  My expectations are certainly above the\naverage: I believe my uncle’s income averages about thirty thousand\npounds, though I admit I was not careful to inform myself.  Put it\nanywhere between fifteen and fifty thousand; it is certainly not less.’\n\n‘All this is very easy to say,’ said Ronald, with a pitying smile.\n‘Unfortunately, these things are in the air.’\n\n‘Pardon me,—in Buckinghamshire,’ said I, smiling.\n\n‘Well, what I mean is, my dear St. Ives, that you _can’t prove_ them,’ he\ncontinued.  ‘They might just as well not be: do you follow me?  You can’t\nbring us any third party to back you.’\n\n‘Oh, come!’ cried I, springing up and hurrying to the table.  ‘You must\nexcuse me!’  I wrote Romaine’s address.  ‘There is my reference, Mr.\nGilchrist.  Until you have written to him, and received his negative\nanswer, I have a right to be treated, and I shall see that you treat me,\nas a gentleman.’  He was brought up with a round turn at that.\n\n‘I beg your pardon, St. Ives,’ said he.  ‘Believe me, I had no wish to be\noffensive.  But there’s the difficulty of this affair; I can’t make any\nof my points without offence!  You must excuse me, it’s not my fault.\nBut, at any rate, you must see for yourself this proposal of marriage\nis—is merely impossible, my dear fellow.  It’s nonsense!  Our countries\nare at war; you are a prisoner.’\n\n‘My ancestor of the time of the Ligue,’ I replied, ‘married a Huguenot\nlady out of the Saintonge, riding two hundred miles through an enemy’s\ncountry to bring off his bride; and it was a happy marriage.’\n\n‘Well!’ he began; and then looked down into the fire, and became silent.\n\n‘Well?’ I asked.\n\n‘Well, there’s this business of—Goguelat,’ said he, still looking at the\ncoals in the grate.\n\n‘What!’ I exclaimed, starting in my chair.  ‘What’s that you say?’\n\n‘This business about Goguelat,’ he repeated.\n\n‘Ronald,’ said I, ‘this is not your doing.  These are not your own words.\nI know where they came from: a coward put them in your mouth.’\n\n‘St. Ives!’ he cried, ‘why do you make it so hard for me? and where’s the\nuse of insulting other people?  The plain English is, that I can’t hear\nof any proposal of marriage from a man under a charge like that.  You\nmust see it for yourself, man!  It’s the most absurd thing I ever heard\nof!  And you go on forcing me to argue with you, too!’\n\n‘Because I have had an affair of honour which terminated unhappily, you—a\nyoung soldier, or next-door to it—refuse my offer?  Do I understand you\naright?’ said I.\n\n‘My dear fellow!’ he wailed, ‘of course you can twist my words, if you\nlike.  You _say_ it was an affair of honour.  Well, I can’t, of course,\ntell you that—I can’t—I mean, you must see that that’s just the point!\nWas it?  I don’t know.’\n\n‘I have the honour to inform you,’ said I.\n\n‘Well, other people say the reverse, you see!’\n\n‘They lie, Ronald, and I will prove it in time.’\n\n‘The short and the long of it is, that any man who is so unfortunate as\nto have such things said about him is not the man to be my\nbrother-in-law!’ he cried.\n\n‘Do you know who will be my first witness at the court?  Arthur\nChevenix!’ said I.\n\n‘I don’t care!’ he cried, rising from his chair and beginning to pace\noutrageously about the room.  ‘What do you mean, St. Ives?  What is this\nabout?  It’s like a dream, I declare!  You made an offer, and I have\nrefused it.  I don’t like it, I don’t want it; and whatever I did, or\ndidn’t, wouldn’t matter—my aunt wouldn’t bear of it anyway!  Can’t you\ntake your answer, man?’\n\n‘You must remember, Ronald, that we are playing with edged tools,’ said\nI.  ‘An offer of marriage is a delicate subject to handle.  You have\nrefused, and you have justified your refusal by several statements:\nfirst, that I was an impostor; second, that our countries were at war;\nand third— No, I will speak,’ said I; ‘you can answer when I have\ndone,—and third, that I had dishonourably killed—or was said to have done\nso—the man Goguelat.  Now, my dear fellow, these are very awkward grounds\nto be taking.  From any one else’s lips I need scarce tell you how I\nshould resent them; but my hands are tied.  I have so much gratitude to\nyou, without talking of the love I bear your sister, that you insult me,\nwhen you do so, under the cover of a complete impunity.  I must feel the\npain—and I do feel it acutely—I can do nothing to protect myself.’  He\nhad been anxious enough to interrupt me in the beginning; but now, and\nafter I had ceased, he stood a long while silent.\n\n‘St. Ives,’ he said at last, ‘I think I had better go away.  This has\nbeen very irritating.  I never at all meant to say anything of the kind,\nand I apologise to you.  I have all the esteem for you that one gentleman\nshould have for another.  I only meant to tell you—to show you what had\ninfluenced my mind; and that, in short, the thing was impossible.  One\nthing you may be quite sure of: I shall do nothing against you.  Will you\nshake hands before I go away?’ he blurted out.\n\n‘Yes,’ said I, ‘I agree with you—the interview has been irritating.  Let\nbygones be bygones.  Good-bye, Ronald.’\n\n‘Good-bye, St. Ives!’ he returned.  ‘I’m heartily sorry.’\n\nAnd with that he was gone.\n\nThe windows of my own sitting-room looked towards the north; but the\nentrance passage drew its light from the direction of the square.  Hence\nI was able to observe Ronald’s departure, his very disheartened gait, and\nthe fact that he was joined, about half-way, by no less a man than Major\nChevenix.  At this, I could scarce keep from smiling; so unpalatable an\ninterview must be before the pair of them, and I could hear their voices,\nclashing like crossed swords, in that eternal antiphony of ‘I told you,’\nand ‘I told you not.’  Without doubt, they had gained very little by\ntheir visit; but then I had gained less than nothing, and had been\nbitterly dispirited into the bargain.  Ronald had stuck to his guns and\nrefused me to the last.  It was no news; but, on the other hand, it could\nnot be contorted into good news.  I was now certain that during my\ntemporary absence in France, all irons would be put into the fire, and\nthe world turned upside down, to make Flora disown the obtrusive\nFrenchman and accept Chevenix.  Without doubt she would resist these\ninstances: but the thought of them did not please me, and I felt she\nshould be warned and prepared for the battle.\n\nIt was no use to try and see her now, but I promised myself early that\nevening to return to Swanston.  In the meantime I had to make all my\npreparations, and look the coming journey in the face.  Here in Edinburgh\nI was within four miles of the sea, yet the business of approaching\nrandom fishermen with my hat in the one hand and a knife in the other,\nappeared so desperate, that I saw nothing for it but to retrace my steps\nover the northern counties, and knock a second time at the doors of\nBirchell Fenn.  To do this, money would be necessary; and after leaving\nmy paper in the hands of Flora I had still a balance of about fifteen\nhundred pounds.  Or rather I may say I had them and I had them not; for\nafter my luncheon with Mr. Robbie I had placed the amount, all but thirty\npounds of change, in a bank in George Street, on a deposit receipt in the\nname of Mr. Rowley.  This I had designed to be my gift to him, in case I\nmust suddenly depart.  But now, thinking better of the arrangement, I\ndespatched my little man, cockade and all, to lift the fifteen hundred.\n\nHe was not long gone, and returned with a flushed face, and the deposit\nreceipt still in his hand.\n\n‘No go, Mr. Anne,’ says he.\n\n‘How’s that?’ I inquired,\n\n‘Well, sir, I found the place all right, and no mistake,’ said he.  ‘But\nI tell you what gave me a blue fright!  There was a customer standing by\nthe door, and I reckonised him!  Who do you think it was, Mr. Anne?  W’y,\nthat same Red-Breast—him I had breakfast with near Aylesbury.’\n\n‘You are sure you are not mistaken?’ I asked.\n\n‘Certain sure,’ he replied.  ‘Not Mr. Lavender, I don’t mean, sir; I mean\nthe other party.  “Wot’s he doing here?’ says I.  It don’t look right.”’\n\n‘Not by any means,’ I agreed.\n\nI walked to and fro in the apartment reflecting.  This particular Bow\nStreet runner might be here by accident; but it was to imagine a singular\nplay of coincidence that he, who had met Rowley and spoken with him in\nthe ‘Green Dragon,’ hard by Aylesbury, should be now in Scotland, where\nhe could have no legitimate business, and by the doors of the bank where\nRowley kept his account.\n\n‘Rowley,’ said I, ‘he didn’t see you, did he?’\n\n‘Never a fear,’ quoth Rowley.  ‘W’y Mr. Anne, sir, if he ’ad, you\nwouldn’t have seen _me_ any more!  I ain’t a hass, sir!’\n\n‘Well, my boy, you can put that receipt in your pocket.  You’ll have no\nmore use for it till you’re quite clear of me.  Don’t lose it, though;\nit’s your share of the Christmas-box: fifteen hundred pounds all for\nyourself.’\n\n‘Begging your pardon, Mr. Anne, sir, but wot for!’ said Rowley.\n\n‘To set up a public-house upon,’ said I.\n\n‘If you’ll excuse me, sir, I ain’t got any call to set up a public-house,\nsir,’ he replied stoutly.  ‘And I tell you wot, sir, it seems to me I’m\nreether young for the billet.  I’m your body servant, Mr. Anne, or else\nI’m nothink.’\n\n‘Well, Rowley,’ I said, ‘I’ll tell you what it’s for.  It’s for the good\nservice you have done me, of which I don’t care—and don’t dare—to speak.\nIt’s for your loyalty and cheerfulness, my dear boy.  I had meant it for\nyou; but to tell you the truth, it’s past mending now—it has to be yours.\nSince that man is waiting by the bank, the money can’t be touched until\nI’m gone.’\n\n‘Until you’re gone, sir?’ re-echoed Rowley.  ‘You don’t go anywheres\nwithout me, I can tell you that, Mr. Anne, sir!’\n\n‘Yes, my boy,’ said I, ‘we are going to part very soon now; probably\nto-morrow.  And it’s for my sake, Rowley!  Depend upon it, if there was\nany reason at all for that Bow Street man being at the bank, he was not\nthere to look out for you.  How they could have found out about the\naccount so early is more than I can fathom; some strange coincidence must\nhave played me false!  But there the fact is; and Rowley, I’ll not only\nhave to say farewell to you presently, I’ll have to ask you to stay\nindoors until I can say it.  Remember, my boy, it’s only so that you can\nserve me now.’\n\n‘W’y, sir, you say the word, and of course I’ll do it!’ he cried.\n‘“Nothink by ’alves,” is my motto!  I’m your man, through thick and thin,\nlive or die, I am!’\n\nIn the meantime there was nothing to be done till towards sunset.  My\nonly chance now was to come again as quickly as possible to speech of\nFlora, who was my only practicable banker; and not before evening was it\nworth while to think of that.  I might compose myself as well as I was\nable over the _Caledonian Mercury_, with its ill news of the campaign of\nFrance and belated documents about the retreat from Russia; and, as I sat\nthere by the fire, I was sometimes all awake with anger and mortification\nat what I was reading, and sometimes again I would be three parts asleep\nas I dozed over the barren items of home intelligence.  ‘Lately\narrived’—this is what I suddenly stumbled on—‘at Dumbreck’s Hotel, the\nViscount of Saint-Yves.’\n\n‘Rowley,’ said I.\n\n‘If you please, Mr. Anne, sir,’ answered the obsequious, lowering his\npipe.\n\n‘Come and look at this, my boy,’ said I, holding out the paper.\n\n‘My crikey!’ said he.  ‘That’s ’im, sir, sure enough!’\n\n‘Sure enough, Rowley,’ said I.  ‘He’s on the trail.  He has fairly caught\nup with us.  He and this Bow Street man have come together, I would\nswear.  And now here is the whole field, quarry, hounds and hunters, all\ntogether in this city of Edinburgh.’\n\n‘And wot are you goin’ to do now, sir?  Tell you wot, let me take it in\n’and, please!  Gimme a minute, and I’ll disguise myself, and go out to\nthis Dum--- to this hotel, leastways, sir—and see wot he’s up to.  You\nput your trust in me, Mr. Anne: I’m fly, don’t you make no mistake about\nit.  I’m all a-growing and a-blowing, I am.’\n\n‘Not one foot of you,’ said I.  ‘You are a prisoner, Rowley, and make up\nyour mind to that.  So am I, or next door to it.  I showed it you for a\ncaution; if you go on the streets, it spells death to me, Rowley.’\n\n‘If you please, sir,’ says Rowley.\n\n‘Come to think of it,’ I continued, ‘you must take a cold, or something.\nNo good of awakening Mrs. McRankine’s suspicions.’\n\n‘A cold?’ he cried, recovering immediately from his depression.  ‘I can\ndo it, Mr. Anne.’\n\nAnd he proceeded to sneeze and cough and blow his nose, till I could not\nrestrain myself from smiling.\n\n‘Oh, I tell you, I know a lot of them dodges,’ he observed proudly.\n\n‘Well, they come in very handy,’ said I.\n\n‘I’d better go at once and show it to the old gal, ’adn’t I?’ he asked.\n\nI told him, by all means; and he was gone upon the instant, gleeful as\nthough to a game of football.\n\nI took up the paper and read carelessly on, my thoughts engaged with my\nimmediate danger, till I struck on the next paragraph:—\n\n    ‘In connection with the recent horrid murder in the Castle, we are\n    desired to make public the following intelligence.  The soldier,\n    Champdivers, is supposed to be in the neighbourhood of this city.  He\n    is about the middle height or rather under, of a pleasing appearance\n    and highly genteel address.  When last heard of he wore a fashionable\n    suit of pearl-grey, and boots with fawn-coloured tops.  He is\n    accompanied by a servant about sixteen years of age, speaks English\n    without any accent, and passed under the _alias_ of Ramornie.  A\n    reward is offered for his apprehension.’\n\nIn a moment I was in the next room, stripping from me the pearl-coloured\nsuit!\n\nI confess I was now a good deal agitated.  It is difficult to watch the\ntoils closing slowly and surely about you, and to retain your composure;\nand I was glad that Rowley was not present to spy on my confusion.  I was\nflushed, my breath came thick; I cannot remember a time when I was more\nput out.\n\nAnd yet I must wait and do nothing, and partake of my meals, and\nentertain the ever-garrulous Rowley, as though I were entirely my own\nman.  And if I did not require to entertain Mrs. McRankine also, that was\nbut another drop of bitterness in my cup!  For what ailed my landlady,\nthat she should hold herself so severely aloof, that she should refuse\nconversation, that her eyes should be reddened, that I should so\ncontinually hear the voice of her private supplications sounding through\nthe house?  I was much deceived, or she had read the insidious paragraph\nand recognised the comminated pearl-grey suit.  I remember now a certain\nair with which she had laid the paper on my table, and a certain sniff,\nbetween sympathy and defiance, with which she had announced it: ‘There’s\nyour _Mercury_ for ye!’\n\nIn this direction, at least, I saw no pressing danger; her tragic\ncountenance betokened agitation; it was plain she was wrestling with her\nconscience, and the battle still hung dubious.  The question of what to\ndo troubled me extremely.  I could not venture to touch such an intricate\nand mysterious piece of machinery as my landlady’s spiritual nature: it\nmight go off at a word, and in any direction, like a badly-made firework.\nAnd while I praised myself extremely for my wisdom in the past, that I\nhad made so much a friend of her, I was all abroad as to my conduct in\nthe present.  There seemed an equal danger in pressing and in neglecting\nthe accustomed marks of familiarity.  The one extreme looked like\nimpudence, and might annoy, the other was a practical confession of\nguilt.  Altogether, it was a good hour for me when the dusk began to fall\nin earnest on the streets of Edinburgh, and the voice of an early\nwatchman bade me set forth.\n\nI reached the neighbourhood of the cottage before seven; and as I\nbreasted the steep ascent which leads to the garden wall, I was struck\nwith surprise to hear a dog.  Dogs I had heard before, but only from the\nhamlet on the hillside above.  Now, this dog was in the garden itself,\nwhere it roared aloud in paroxysms of fury, and I could hear it leaping\nand straining on the chain.  I waited some while, until the brute’s fit\nof passion had roared itself out.  Then, with the utmost precaution, I\ndrew near again; and finally approached the garden wall.  So soon as I\nhad clapped my head above the level, however, the barking broke forth\nagain with redoubled energy.  Almost at the same time, the door of the\ncottage opened, and Ronald and the Major appeared upon the threshold with\na lantern.  As they so stood, they were almost immediately below me,\nstrongly illuminated, and within easy earshot.  The Major pacified the\ndog, who took instead to low, uneasy growling intermingled with\noccasional yelps.\n\n‘Good thing I brought Towzer!’ said Chevenix.\n\n‘Damn him, I wonder where he is!’ said Ronald; and he moved the lantern\nup and down, and turned the night into a shifting puzzle-work of gleam\nand shadow.  ‘I think I’ll make a sally.’\n\n‘I don’t think you will,’ replied Chevenix.  ‘When I agreed to come out\nhere and do sentry-go, it was on one condition, Master Ronald: don’t you\nforget that!  Military discipline, my boy!  Our beat is this path close\nabout the house.  Down, Towzer! good boy, good boy—gently, then!’ he went\non, caressing his confounded monster.\n\n‘To think!  The beggar may be hearing us this minute!’ cried Ronald.\n\n‘Nothing more probable,’ said the Major.  ‘You there, St. Ives?’ he\nadded, in a distinct but guarded voice.  ‘I only want to tell you, you\nhad better go home.  Mr. Gilchrist and I take watch and watch.’\n\nThe game was up.  ‘_Beaucoup de plaisir_!’ I replied, in the same tones.\n‘_Il fait un peu froid pour veiller_; _gardez-vous des engelures_!’\n\nI suppose it was done in a moment of ungovernable rage; but in spite of\nthe excellent advice he had given to Ronald the moment before, Chevenix\nslipped the chain, and the dog sprang, straight as an arrow, up the bank.\nI stepped back, picked up a stone of about twelve pounds weight, and\nstood ready.  With a bound the beast landed on the cope-stone of the\nwall; and, almost in the same instant, my missile caught him fair in the\nface.  He gave a stifled cry, went tumbling back where he had come from,\nand I could hear the twelve-pounder accompany him in his fall.  Chevenix,\nat the same moment, broke out in a roaring voice: ‘The hell-hound!  If\nhe’s killed my dog!’ and I judged, upon all grounds, it was as well to be\noff.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX—EVENTS OF WEDNESDAY; THE UNIVERSITY OF CRAMOND\n\n\nI awoke to much diffidence, even to a feeling that might be called the\nbeginnings of panic, and lay for hours in my bed considering the\nsituation.  Seek where I pleased, there was nothing to encourage me and\nplenty to appal.  They kept a close watch about the cottage; they had a\nbeast of a watch-dog—at least, unless I had settled it; and if I had, I\nknew its bereaved master would only watch the more indefatigably for the\nloss.  In the pardonable ostentation of love I had given all the money I\ncould spare to Flora; I had thought it glorious that the hunted exile\nshould come down, like Jupiter, in a shower of gold, and pour thousands\nin the lap of the beloved.  Then I had in an hour of arrant folly buried\nwhat remained to me in a bank in George Street.  And now I must get back\nthe one or the other; and which? and how?\n\nAs I tossed in my bed, I could see three possible courses, all extremely\nperilous.  First, Rowley might have been mistaken; the bank might not be\nwatched; it might still be possible for him to draw the money on the\ndeposit receipt.  Second, I might apply again to Robbie.  Or, third, I\nmight dare everything, go to the Assembly Ball, and speak with Flora\nunder the eyes of all Edinburgh.  This last alternative, involving as it\ndid the most horrid risks, and the delay of forty-eight hours, I did but\nglance at with an averted head, and turned again to the consideration of\nthe others.  It was the likeliest thing in the world that Robbie had been\nwarned to have no more to do with me. The whole policy of the Gilchrists\nwas in the hands of Chevenix; and I thought this was a precaution so\nelementary that he was certain to have taken it.  If he had not, of\ncourse I was all right: Robbie would manage to communicate with Flora;\nand by four o’clock I might be on the south road and, I was going to say,\na free man.  Lastly, I must assure myself with my own eyes whether the\nbank in George Street were beleaguered.\n\nI called to Rowley and questioned him tightly as to the appearance of the\nBow Street officer.\n\n‘What sort of looking man is he, Rowley?’ I asked, as I began to dress.\n\n‘Wot sort of a looking man he is?’ repeated Rowley.  ‘Well, I don’t very\nwell know wot you would say, Mr. Anne.  He ain’t a beauty, any’ow.’\n\n‘Is he tall?’\n\n‘Tall?  Well, no, I shouldn’t say _tall_ Mr. Anne.’\n\n‘Well, then, is he short?’\n\n‘Short?  No, I don’t think I would say he was what you would call\n_short_.  No, not piticular short, sir.’\n\n‘Then, I suppose, he must be about the middle height?’\n\n‘Well, you might say it, sir; but not remarkable so.’\n\nI smothered an oath.\n\n‘Is he clean-shaved?’ I tried him again.\n\n‘Clean-shaved?’ he repeated, with the same air of anxious candour.\n\n‘Good heaven, man, don’t repeat my words like a parrot!’ I cried.  ‘Tell\nme what the man was like: it is of the first importance that I should be\nable to recognise him.’\n\n‘I’m trying to, Mr. Anne.  But _clean-shaved_?  I don’t seem to rightly\nget hold of that p’int.  Sometimes it might appear to me like as if he\nwas; and sometimes like as if he wasn’t.  No, it wouldn’t surprise me now\nif you was to tell me he ’ad a bit o’ whisker.’\n\n‘Was the man red-faced?’ I roared, dwelling on each syllable.\n\n‘I don’t think you need go for to get cross about it, Mr. Anne!’ said he.\n‘I’m tellin’ you every blessed thing I see!  Red-faced?  Well, no, not as\nyou would remark upon.’\n\nA dreadful calm fell upon me.\n\n‘Was he anywise pale?’ I asked.\n\n‘Well, it don’t seem to me as though he were.  But I tell you truly, I\ndidn’t take much heed to that.’\n\n‘Did he look like a drinking man?’\n\n‘Well, no.  If you please, sir, he looked more like an eating one.’\n\n‘Oh, he was stout, was he?’\n\n‘No, sir.  I couldn’t go so far as that.  No, he wasn’t not to say\n_stout_.  If anything, lean rather.’\n\nI need not go on with the infuriating interview.  It ended as it began,\nexcept that Rowley was in tears, and that I had acquired one fact.  The\nman was drawn for me as being of any height you like to mention, and of\nany degree of corpulence or leanness; clean-shaved or not, as the case\nmight be; the colour of his hair Rowley ‘could not take it upon himself\nto put a name on’; that of his eyes he thought to have been blue—nay, it\nwas the one point on which he attained to a kind of tearful certainty.\n‘I’ll take my davy on it,’ he asseverated.  They proved to have been as\nblack as sloes, very little and very near together.  So much for the\nevidence of the artless!  And the fact, or rather the facts, acquired?\nWell, they had to do not with the person but with his clothing.  The man\nwore knee-breeches and white stockings; his coat was ‘some kind of a\nlightish colour—or betwixt that and dark’; and he wore a ‘mole-skin\nweskit.’  As if this were not enough, he presently haled me from my\nbreakfast in a prodigious flutter, and showed me an honest and rather\nvenerable citizen passing in the Square.\n\n‘That’s _him_, sir,’ he cried, ‘the very moral of him!  Well, this one is\nbetter dressed, and p’r’aps a trifler taller; and in the face he don’t\nfavour him noways at all, sir.  No, not when I come to look again, ’e\ndon’t seem to favour him noways.’\n\n‘Jackass!’ said I, and I think the greatest stickler for manners will\nadmit the epithet to have been justified.\n\nMeanwhile the appearance of my landlady added a great load of anxiety to\nwhat I already suffered.  It was plain that she had not slept; equally\nplain that she had wept copiously.  She sighed, she groaned, she drew in\nher breath, she shook her head, as she waited on table.  In short, she\nseemed in so precarious a state, like a petard three times charged with\nhysteria, that I did not dare to address her; and stole out of the house\non tiptoe, and actually ran downstairs, in the fear that she might call\nme back.  It was plain that this degree of tension could not last long.\n\nIt was my first care to go to George Street, which I reached (by good\nluck) as a boy was taking down the bank shutters.  A man was conversing\nwith him; he had white stockings and a moleskin waistcoat, and was as\nill-looking a rogue as you would want to see in a day’s journey.  This\nseemed to agree fairly well with Rowley’s _signalement_: he had declared\nemphatically (if you remember), and had stuck to it besides, that the\ncompanion of the great Lavender was no beauty.\n\nThence I made my way to Mr. Robbie’s, where I rang the bell.  A servant\nanswered the summons, and told me the lawyer was engaged, as I had half\nexpected.\n\n‘Wha shall I say was callin’?’ she pursued; and when I had told her ‘Mr.\nDucie,’ ‘I think this’ll be for you, then?’ she added, and handed me a\nletter from the hall table.  It ran:\n\n    ‘DEAR MR. DUCIE,\n\n    ‘My single advice to you is to leave _quam primum_ for the South.\n\n                                                        Yours, T. ROBBIE.’\n\nThat was short and sweet.  It emphatically extinguished hope in one\ndirection.  No more was to be gotten of Robbie; and I wondered, from my\nheart, how much had been told him.  Not too much, I hoped, for I liked\nthe lawyer who had thus deserted me, and I placed a certain reliance in\nthe discretion of Chevenix.  He would not be merciful; on the other hand,\nI did not think he would be cruel without cause.\n\nIt was my next affair to go back along George Street, and assure myself\nwhether the man in the moleskin vest was still on guard.  There was no\nsign of him on the pavement.  Spying the door of a common stair nearly\nopposite the bank, I took it in my head that this would be a good point\nof observation, crossed the street, entered with a businesslike air and\nfell immediately against the man in the moleskin vest.  I stopped and\napologised to him; he replied in an unmistakable English accent, thus\nputting the matter almost beyond doubt.  After this encounter I must, of\ncourse, ascend to the top story, ring the bell of a suite of apartments,\ninquire for Mr. Vavasour, learn (with no great surprise) that he did not\nlive there, come down again and, again politely saluting the man from Bow\nStreet, make my escape at last into the street.\n\nI was now driven back upon the Assembly Ball.  Robbie had failed me.  The\nbank was watched; it would never do to risk Rowley in that neighbourhood.\nAll I could do was to wait until the morrow evening, and present myself\nat the Assembly, let it end as it might.  But I must say I came to this\ndecision with a good deal of genuine fright; and here I came for the\nfirst time to one of those places where my courage stuck.  I do not mean\nthat my courage boggled and made a bit of a bother over it, as it did\nover the escape from the Castle; I mean, stuck, like a stopped watch or a\ndead man.  Certainly I would go to the ball; certainly I must see this\nmorning about my clothes.  That was all decided.  But the most of the\nshops were on the other side of the valley, in the Old Town; and it was\nnow my strange discovery that I was physically unable to cross the North\nBridge!  It was as though a precipice had stood between us, or the deep\nsea had intervened.  Nearer to the Castle my legs refused to bear me.\n\nI told myself this was mere superstition; I made wagers with myself—and\ngained them; I went down on the esplanade of Princes Street, walked and\nstood there, alone and conspicuous, looking across the garden at the old\ngrey bastions of the fortress, where all these troubles had begun.  I\ncocked my hat, set my hand on my hip, and swaggered on the pavement,\nconfronting detection.  And I found I could do all this with a sense of\nexhilaration that was not unpleasing, and with a certain _crânerie_ of\nmanner that raised me in my own esteem.  And yet there was one thing I\ncould not bring my mind to face up to, or my limbs to execute; and that\nwas to cross the valley into the Old Town.  It seemed to me I must be\narrested immediately if I had done so; I must go straight into the\ntwilight of a prison cell, and pass straight thence to the gross and\nfinal embraces of the nightcap and the halter.  And yet it was from no\nreasoned fear of the consequences that I could not go.  I was unable.  My\nhorse baulked, and there was an end!\n\nMy nerve was gone: here was a discovery for a man in such imminent peril,\nset down to so desperate a game, which I could only hope to win by\ncontinual luck and unflagging effrontery!  The strain had been too long\ncontinued, and my nerve was gone.  I fell into what they call panic fear,\nas I have seen soldiers do on the alarm of a night attack, and turned out\nof Princes Street at random as though the devil were at my heels.  In St.\nAndrew Square, I remember vaguely hearing some one call out.  I paid no\nheed, but pressed on blindly.  A moment after, a hand fell heavily on my\nshoulder, and I thought I had fainted.  Certainly the world went black\nabout me for some seconds; and when that spasm passed I found myself\nstanding face to face with the ‘cheerful extravagant,’ in what sort of\ndisarray I really dare not imagine, dead white at least, shaking like an\naspen, and mowing at the man with speechless lips.  And this was the\nsoldier of Napoleon, and the gentleman who intended going next night to\nan Assembly Ball!  I am the more particular in telling of my breakdown,\nbecause it was my only experience of the sort; and it is a good tale for\nofficers.  I will allow no man to call me coward; I have made my proofs;\nfew men more.  And yet I (come of the best blood in France and inured to\ndanger from a child) did, for some ten or twenty minutes, make this\nhideous exhibition of myself on the streets of the New Town of Edinburgh.\n\nWith my first available breath I begged his pardon.  I was of an\nextremely nervous disposition, recently increased by late hours; I could\nnot bear the slightest start.\n\nHe seemed much concerned.  ‘You must be in a devil of a state!’ said he;\n‘though of course it was my fault—damnably silly, vulgar sort of thing to\ndo!  A thousand apologies!  But you really must be run down; you should\nconsult a medico.  My dear sir, a hair of the dog that bit you is clearly\nindicated.  A touch of Blue Ruin, now?  Or, come: it’s early, but is man\nthe slave of hours? what do you say to a chop and a bottle in Dumbreck’s\nHotel?’\n\nI refused all false comfort; but when he went on to remind me that this\nwas the day when the University of Cramond met; and to propose a\nfive-mile walk into the country and a dinner in the company of young\nasses like himself, I began to think otherwise.  I had to wait until\nto-morrow evening, at any rate; this might serve as well as anything else\nto bridge the dreary hours.  The country was the very place for me: and\nwalking is an excellent sedative for the nerves.  Remembering poor\nRowley, feigning a cold in our lodgings and immediately under the guns of\nthe formidable and now doubtful Bethiah, I asked if I might bring my\nservant.  ‘Poor devil! it is dull for him,’ I explained.\n\n‘The merciful man is merciful to his ass,’ observed my sententious\nfriend.  ‘Bring him by all means!\n\n    “The harp, his sole remaining joy,\n    Was carried by an orphan boy;”\n\nand I have no doubt the orphan boy can get some cold victuals in the\nkitchen, while the Senatus dines.’\n\nAccordingly, being now quite recovered from my unmanly condition, except\nthat nothing could yet induce me to cross the North Bridge, I arranged\nfor my ball dress at a shop in Leith Street, where I was not served ill,\ncut out Rowley from his seclusion, and was ready along with him at the\ntrysting-place, the corner of Duke Street and York Place, by a little\nafter two.  The University was represented in force: eleven persons,\nincluding ourselves, Byfield the aeronaut, and the tall lad, Forbes, whom\nI had met on the Sunday morning, bedewed with tallow, at the ‘Hunters’\nRest.’  I was introduced; and we set off by way of Newhaven and the sea\nbeach; at first through pleasant country roads, and afterwards along a\nsuccession of bays of a fairylike prettiness, to our destination—Cramond\non the Almond—a little hamlet on a little river, embowered in woods, and\nlooking forth over a great flat of quicksand to where a little islet\nstood planted in the sea.  It was miniature scenery, but charming of its\nkind.  The air of this good February afternoon was bracing, but not cold.\nAll the way my companions were skylarking, jesting and making puns, and I\nfelt as if a load had been taken off my lungs and spirits, and skylarked\nwith the best of them.\n\nByfield I observed, because I had heard of him before, and seen his\nadvertisements, not at all because I was disposed to feel interest in the\nman.  He was dark and bilious and very silent; frigid in his manners, but\nburning internally with a great fire of excitement; and he was so good as\nto bestow a good deal of his company and conversation (such as it was)\nupon myself, who was not in the least grateful.  If I had known how I was\nto be connected with him in the immediate future, I might have taken more\npains.\n\nIn the hamlet of Cramond there is a hostelry of no very promising\nappearance, and here a room had been prepared for us, and we sat down to\ntable.\n\n‘Here you will find no guttling or gormandising, no turtle or\nnightingales’ tongues,’ said the extravagant, whose name, by the way, was\nDalmahoy.  ‘The device, sir, of the University of Cramond is Plain Living\nand High Drinking.’\n\nGrace was said by the Professor of Divinity, in a macaronic Latin, which\nI could by no means follow, only I could hear it rhymed, and I guessed it\nto be more witty than reverent.  After which the _Senatus Academicus_ sat\ndown to rough plenty in the shape of rizzar’d haddocks and mustard, a\nsheep’s head, a haggis, and other delicacies of Scotland.  The dinner was\nwashed down with brown stout in bottle, and as soon as the cloth was\nremoved, glasses, boiling water, sugar, and whisky were set out for the\nmanufacture of toddy.  I played a good knife and fork, did not shun the\nbowl, and took part, so far as I was able, in the continual fire of\npleasantry with which the meal was seasoned.  Greatly daring, I ventured,\nbefore all these Scotsmen, to tell Sim’s Tale of Tweedie’s dog; and I was\nheld to have done such extraordinary justice to the dialect, ‘for a\nSouthron,’ that I was immediately voted into the Chair of Scots, and\nbecame, from that moment, a full member of the University of Cramond.  A\nlittle after, I found myself entertaining them with a song; and a little\nafter—perhaps a little in consequence—it occurred to me that I had had\nenough, and would be very well inspired to take French leave.  It was not\ndifficult to manage, for it was nobody’s business to observe my\nmovements, and conviviality had banished suspicion.\n\nI got easily forth of the chamber, which reverberated with the voices of\nthese merry and learned gentlemen, and breathed a long breath.  I had\npassed an agreeable afternoon and evening, and I had apparently escaped\nscot free.  Alas! when I looked into the kitchen, there was my monkey,\ndrunk as a lord, toppling on the edge of the dresser, and performing on\nthe flageolet to an audience of the house lasses and some neighbouring\nploughmen.\n\nI routed him promptly from his perch, stuck his hat on, put his\ninstrument in his pocket, and set off with him for Edinburgh.\n\nHis limbs were of paper, his mind quite in abeyance; I must uphold and\nguide him, prevent his frantic dives, and set him continually on his legs\nagain.  At first he sang wildly, with occasional outbursts of causeless\nlaughter.  Gradually an inarticulate melancholy succeeded; he wept gently\nat times; would stop in the middle of the road, say firmly ‘No, no, no,’\nand then fall on his back: or else address me solemnly as ‘M’lord’ and\nfall on his face by way of variety.  I am afraid I was not always so\ngentle with the little pig as I might have been, but really the position\nwas unbearable.  We made no headway at all, and I suppose we were scarce\ngotten a mile away from Cramond, when the whole _Senatus Academicus_ was\nheard hailing, and doubling the pace to overtake its.\n\nSome of them were fairly presentable; and they were all Christian martyrs\ncompared to Rowley; but they were in a frolicsome and rollicking humour\nthat promised danger as we approached the town.  They sang songs, they\nran races, they fenced with their walking-sticks and umbrellas; and, in\nspite of this violent exercise, the fun grew only the more extravagant\nwith the miles they traversed.  Their drunkenness was deep-seated and\npermanent, like fire in a peat; or rather—to be quite just to them—it was\nnot so much to be called drunkenness at all, as the effect of youth and\nhigh spirits—a fine night, and the night young, a good road under foot,\nand the world before you!\n\nI had left them once somewhat unceremoniously; I could not attempt it a\nsecond time; and, burthened as I was with Mr. Rowley, I was really glad\nof assistance.  But I saw the lamps of Edinburgh draw near on their\nhill-top with a good deal of uneasiness, which increased, after we had\nentered the lighted streets, to positive alarm.  All the passers-by were\naddressed, some of them by name.  A worthy man was stopped by Forbes.\n‘Sir,’ said he, ‘in the name of the Senatus of the University of Cramond,\nI confer upon you the degree of LL.D.,’ and with the words he bonneted\nhim.  Conceive the predicament of St. Ives, committed to the society of\nthese outrageous youths, in a town where the police and his cousin were\nboth looking for him!  So far, we had pursued our way unmolested,\nalthough raising a clamour fit to wake the dead; but at last, in\nAbercromby Place, I believe—at least it was a crescent of highly\nrespectable houses fronting on a garden—Byfield and I, having fallen\nsomewhat in the rear with Rowley, came to a simultaneous halt.  Our\nruffians were beginning to wrench off bells and door-plates!\n\n‘Oh, I say!’ says Byfield, ‘this is too much of a good thing!  Confound\nit, I’m a respectable man—a public character, by George!  I can’t afford\nto get taken up by the police.’\n\n‘My own case exactly,’ said I.\n\n‘Here, let’s bilk them,’ said he.\n\nAnd we turned back and took our way down hill again.\n\nIt was none too soon: voices and alarm bells sounded; watchmen here and\nthere began to spring their rattles; it was plain the University of\nCramond would soon be at blows with the police of Edinburgh!  Byfield and\nI, running the semi-inanimate Rowley before us, made good despatch, and\ndid not stop till we were several streets away, and the hubbub was\nalready softened by distance.\n\n‘Well, sir,’ said he, ‘we are well out of that!  Did ever any one see\nsuch a pack of young barbarians?’\n\n‘We are properly punished, Mr. Byfield; we had no business there,’ I\nreplied.\n\n‘No, indeed, sir, you may well say that!  Outrageous!  And my ascension\nannounced for Friday, you know!’ cried the aeronaut.  ‘A pretty scandal!\nByfield the aeronaut at the police-court!  Tut-tut!  Will you be able to\nget your rascal home, sir?  Allow me to offer you my card.  I am staying\nat Walker and Poole’s Hotel, sir, where I should be pleased to see you.’\n\n‘The pleasure would be mutual, sir,’ said I, but I must say my heart was\nnot in my words, and as I watched Mr. Byfield departing I desired nothing\nless than to pursue the acquaintance\n\nOne more ordeal remained for me to pass.  I carried my senseless load\nupstairs to our lodging, and was admitted by the landlady in a tall white\nnightcap and with an expression singularly grim.  She lighted us into the\nsitting-room; where, when I had seated Rowley in a chair, she dropped me\na cast-iron courtesy.  I smelt gunpowder on the woman.  Her voice,\ntottered with emotion.\n\n‘I give ye nottice, Mr. Ducie,’ said she.  ‘Dacent folks’ houses . . .’\n\nAnd at that apparently temper cut off her utterance, and she took herself\noff without more words.\n\nI looked about me at the room, the goggling Rowley, the extinguished\nfire; my mind reviewed the laughable incidents of the day and night; and\nI laughed out loud to myself—lonely and cheerless laughter!.......\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n             [_At this point the Author’s_ MS. _breaks off_]\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n{0}  This Project Gutenberg eText does not include the extra chapters."
