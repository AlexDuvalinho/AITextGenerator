To the Editors of these papers I am indebted for their\ncourtesy in allowing me to reprint them.\n\n                                                                  H. H. M.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHE-WOLF\n\n\nLeonard Bilsiter was one of those people who have failed to find this\nworld attractive or interesting, and who have sought compensation in an\n“unseen world” of their own experience or imagination—or invention.\nChildren do that sort of thing successfully, but children are content to\nconvince themselves, and do not vulgarise their beliefs by trying to\nconvince other people.  Leonard Bilsiter’s beliefs were for “the few,”\nthat is to say, anyone who would listen to him.\n\nHis dabblings in the unseen might not have carried him beyond the\ncustomary platitudes of the drawing-room visionary if accident had not\nreinforced his stock-in-trade of mystical lore.  In company with a\nfriend, who was interested in a Ural mining concern, he had made a trip\nacross Eastern Europe at a moment when the great Russian railway strike\nwas developing from a threat to a reality; its outbreak caught him on the\nreturn journey, somewhere on the further side of Perm, and it was while\nwaiting for a couple of days at a wayside station in a state of suspended\nlocomotion that he made the acquaintance of a dealer in harness and\nmetalware, who profitably whiled away the tedium of the long halt by\ninitiating his English travelling companion in a fragmentary system of\nfolk-lore that he had picked up from Trans-Baikal traders and natives.\nLeonard returned to his home circle garrulous about his Russian strike\nexperiences, but oppressively reticent about certain dark mysteries,\nwhich he alluded to under the resounding title of Siberian Magic.  The\nreticence wore off in a week or two under the influence of an entire lack\nof general curiosity, and Leonard began to make more detailed allusions\nto the enormous powers which this new esoteric force, to use his own\ndescription of it, conferred on the initiated few who knew how to wield\nit.  His aunt, Cecilia Hoops, who loved sensation perhaps rather better\nthan she loved the truth, gave him as clamorous an advertisement as\nanyone could wish for by retailing an account of how he had turned a\nvegetable marrow into a wood pigeon before her very eyes.  As a\nmanifestation of the possession of supernatural powers, the story was\ndiscounted in some quarters by the respect accorded to Mrs. Hoops’ powers\nof imagination.\n\nHowever divided opinion might be on the question of Leonard’s status as a\nwonderworker or a charlatan, he certainly arrived at Mary Hampton’s\nhouse-party with a reputation for pre-eminence in one or other of those\nprofessions, and he was not disposed to shun such publicity as might fall\nto his share.  Esoteric forces and unusual powers figured largely in\nwhatever conversation he or his aunt had a share in, and his own\nperformances, past and potential, were the subject of mysterious hints\nand dark avowals.\n\n“I wish you would turn me into a wolf, Mr. Bilsiter,” said his hostess at\nluncheon the day after his arrival.\n\n“My dear Mary,” said Colonel Hampton, “I never knew you had a craving in\nthat direction.”\n\n“A she-wolf, of course,” continued Mrs. Hampton; “it would be too\nconfusing to change one’s sex as well as one’s species at a moment’s\nnotice.”\n\n“I don’t think one should jest on these subjects,” said Leonard.\n\n“I’m not jesting, I’m quite serious, I assure you.  Only don’t do it\nto-day; we have only eight available bridge players, and it would break\nup one of our tables.  To-morrow we shall be a larger party.  To-morrow\nnight, after dinner—”\n\n“In our present imperfect understanding of these hidden forces I think\none should approach them with humbleness rather than mockery,” observed\nLeonard, with such severity that the subject was forthwith dropped.\n\nClovis Sangrail had sat unusually silent during the discussion on the\npossibilities of Siberian Magic; after lunch he side-tracked Lord Pabham\ninto the comparative seclusion of the billiard-room and delivered himself\nof a searching question.\n\n“Have you such a thing as a she-wolf in your collection of wild animals?\nA she-wolf of moderately good temper?”\n\nLord Pabham considered.  “There is Louisa,” he said, “a rather fine\nspecimen of the timber-wolf.  I got her two years ago in exchange for\nsome Arctic foxes.  Most of my animals get to be fairly tame before\nthey’ve been with me very long; I think I can say Louisa has an angelic\ntemper, as she-wolves go.  Why do you ask?”\n\n“I was wondering whether you would lend her to me for to-morrow night,”\nsaid Clovis, with the careless solicitude of one who borrows a collar\nstud or a tennis racquet.\n\n“To-morrow night?”\n\n“Yes, wolves are nocturnal animals, so the late hours won’t hurt her,”\nsaid Clovis, with the air of one who has taken everything into\nconsideration; “one of your men could bring her over from Pabham Park\nafter dusk, and with a little help he ought to be able to smuggle her\ninto the conservatory at the same moment that Mary Hampton makes an\nunobtrusive exit.”\n\nLord Pabham stared at Clovis for a moment in pardonable bewilderment;\nthen his face broke into a wrinkled network of laughter.\n\n“Oh, that’s your game, is it?  You are going to do a little Siberian\nMagic on your own account.  And is Mrs. Hampton willing to be a\nfellow-conspirator?”\n\n“Mary is pledged to see me through with it, if you will guarantee\nLouisa’s temper.”\n\n“I’ll answer for Louisa,” said Lord Pabham.\n\nBy the following day the house-party had swollen to larger proportions,\nand Bilsiter’s instinct for self-advertisement expanded duly under the\nstimulant of an increased audience.  At dinner that evening he held forth\nat length on the subject of unseen forces and untested powers, and his\nflow of impressive eloquence continued unabated while coffee was being\nserved in the drawing-room preparatory to a general migration to the\ncard-room.\n\nHis aunt ensured a respectful hearing for his utterances, but her\nsensation-loving soul hankered after something more dramatic than mere\nvocal demonstration.\n\n“Won’t you do something to _convince_ them of your powers, Leonard?” she\npleaded; “change something into another shape.  He can, you know, if he\nonly chooses to,” she informed the company.\n\n“Oh, do,” said Mavis Pellington earnestly, and her request was echoed by\nnearly everyone present.  Even those who were not open to conviction were\nperfectly willing to be entertained by an exhibition of amateur\nconjuring.\n\nLeonard felt that something tangible was expected of him.\n\n“Has anyone present,” he asked, “got a three-penny bit or some small\nobject of no particular value—?”\n\n“You’re surely not going to make coins disappear, or something primitive\nof that sort?” said Clovis contemptuously.\n\n“I think it very unkind of you not to carry out my suggestion of turning\nme into a wolf,” said Mary Hampton, as she crossed over to the\nconservatory to give her macaws their usual tribute from the dessert\ndishes.\n\n“I have already warned you of the danger of treating these powers in a\nmocking spirit,” said Leonard solemnly.\n\n“I don’t believe you can do it,” laughed Mary provocatively from the\nconservatory; “I dare you to do it if you can.  I defy you to turn me\ninto a wolf.”\n\nAs she said this she was lost to view behind a clump of azaleas.\n\n“Mrs. Hampton—” began Leonard with increased solemnity, but he got no\nfurther.  A breath of chill air seemed to rush across the room, and at\nthe same time the macaws broke forth into ear-splitting screams.\n\n“What on earth is the matter with those confounded birds, Mary?”\nexclaimed Colonel Hampton; at the same moment an even more piercing\nscream from Mavis Pellington stampeded the entire company from their\nseats.  In various attitudes of helpless horror or instinctive defence\nthey confronted the evil-looking grey beast that was peering at them from\namid a setting of fern and azalea.\n\nMrs. Hoops was the first to recover from the general chaos of fright and\nbewilderment.\n\n“Leonard!” she screamed shrilly to her nephew, “turn it back into Mrs.\nHampton at once!  It may fly at us at any moment.  Turn it back!”\n\n“I—I don’t know how to,” faltered Leonard, who looked more scared and\nhorrified than anyone.\n\n“What!” shouted Colonel Hampton, “you’ve taken the abominable liberty of\nturning my wife into a wolf, and now you stand there calmly and say you\ncan’t turn her back again!”\n\nTo do strict justice to Leonard, calmness was not a distinguishing\nfeature of his attitude at the moment.\n\n“I assure you I didn’t turn Mrs. Hampton into a wolf; nothing was farther\nfrom my intentions,” he protested.\n\n“Then where is she, and how came that animal into the conservatory?”\ndemanded the Colonel.\n\n“Of course we must accept your assurance that you didn’t turn Mrs.\nHampton into a wolf,” said Clovis politely, “but you will agree that\nappearances are against you.”\n\n“Are we to have all these recriminations with that beast standing there\nready to tear us to pieces?” wailed Mavis indignantly.\n\n“Lord Pabham, you know a good deal about wild beasts—” suggested Colonel\nHampton.\n\n“The wild beasts that I have been accustomed to,” said Lord Pabham, “have\ncome with proper credentials from well-known dealers, or have been bred\nin my own menagerie.  I’ve never before been confronted with an animal\nthat walks unconcernedly out of an azalea bush, leaving a charming and\npopular hostess unaccounted for.  As far as one can judge from _outward_\ncharacteristics,” he continued, “it has the appearance of a well-grown\nfemale of the North American timber-wolf, a variety of the common species\n_canis lupus_.”\n\n“Oh, never mind its Latin name,” screamed Mavis, as the beast came a step\nor two further into the room; “can’t you entice it away with food, and\nshut it up where it can’t do any harm?”\n\n“If it is really Mrs. Hampton, who has just had a very good dinner, I\ndon’t suppose food will appeal to it very strongly,” said Clovis.\n\n“Leonard,” beseeched Mrs. Hoops tearfully, “even if this is none of your\ndoing can’t you use your great powers to turn this dreadful beast into\nsomething harmless before it bites us all—a rabbit or something?”\n\n“I don’t suppose Colonel Hampton would care to have his wife turned into\na succession of fancy animals as though we were playing a round game with\nher,” interposed Clovis.\n\n“I absolutely forbid it,” thundered the Colonel.\n\n“Most wolves that I’ve had anything to do with have been inordinately\nfond of sugar,” said Lord Pabham; “if you like I’ll try the effect on\nthis one.”\n\nHe took a piece of sugar from the saucer of his coffee cup and flung it\nto the expectant Louisa, who snapped it in mid-air.  There was a sigh of\nrelief from the company; a wolf that ate sugar when it might at the least\nhave been employed in tearing macaws to pieces had already shed some of\nits terrors.  The sigh deepened to a gasp of thanks-giving when Lord\nPabham decoyed the animal out of the room by a pretended largesse of\nfurther sugar.  There was an instant rush to the vacated conservatory.\nThere was no trace of Mrs. Hampton except the plate containing the\nmacaws’ supper.\n\n“The door is locked on the inside!” exclaimed Clovis, who had deftly\nturned the key as he affected to test it.\n\nEveryone turned towards Bilsiter.\n\n“If you haven’t turned my wife into a wolf,” said Colonel Hampton, “will\nyou kindly explain where she has disappeared to, since she obviously\ncould not have gone through a locked door?  I will not press you for an\nexplanation of how a North American timber-wolf suddenly appeared in the\nconservatory, but I think I have some right to inquire what has become of\nMrs. Hampton.”\n\nBilsiter’s reiterated disclaimer was met with a general murmur of\nimpatient disbelief.\n\n“I refuse to stay another hour under this roof,” declared Mavis\nPellington.\n\n“If our hostess has really vanished out of human form,” said Mrs. Hoops,\n“none of the ladies of the party can very well remain.  I absolutely\ndecline to be chaperoned by a wolf!”\n\n“It’s a she-wolf,” said Clovis soothingly.\n\nThe correct etiquette to be observed under the unusual circumstances\nreceived no further elucidation.  The sudden entry of Mary Hampton\ndeprived the discussion of its immediate interest.\n\n“Some one has mesmerised me,” she exclaimed crossly; “I found myself in\nthe game larder, of all places, being fed with sugar by Lord Pabham.  I\nhate being mesmerised, and the doctor has forbidden me to touch sugar.”\n\nThe situation was explained to her, as far as it permitted of anything\nthat could be called explanation.\n\n“Then you _really_ did turn me into a wolf, Mr. Bilsiter?” she exclaimed\nexcitedly.\n\nBut Leonard had burned the boat in which he might now have embarked on a\nsea of glory.  He could only shake his head feebly.\n\n“It was I who took that liberty,” said Clovis; “you see, I happen to have\nlived for a couple of years in North-Eastern Russia, and I have more than\na tourist’s acquaintance with the magic craft of that region.  One does\nnot care to speak about these strange powers, but once in a way, when one\nhears a lot of nonsense being talked about them, one is tempted to show\nwhat Siberian magic can accomplish in the hands of someone who really\nunderstands it.  I yielded to that temptation.  May I have some brandy?\nthe effort has left me rather faint.”\n\nIf Leonard Bilsiter could at that moment have transformed Clovis into a\ncockroach and then have stepped on him he would gladly have performed\nboth operations.\n\n\n\n\nLAURA\n\n\n“You are not really dying, are you?” asked Amanda.\n\n“I have the doctor’s permission to live till Tuesday,” said Laura.\n\n“But to-day is Saturday; this is serious!” gasped Amanda.\n\n“I don’t know about it being serious; it is certainly Saturday,” said\nLaura.\n\n“Death is always serious,” said Amanda.\n\n“I never said I was going to die.  I am presumably going to leave off\nbeing Laura, but I shall go on being something.  An animal of some kind,\nI suppose.  You see, when one hasn’t been very good in the life one has\njust lived, one reincarnates in some lower organism.  And I haven’t been\nvery good, when one comes to think of it.  I’ve been petty and mean and\nvindictive and all that sort of thing when circumstances have seemed to\nwarrant it.”\n\n“Circumstances never warrant that sort of thing,” said Amanda hastily.\n\n“If you don’t mind my saying so,” observed Laura, “Egbert is a\ncircumstance that would warrant any amount of that sort of thing.  You’re\nmarried to him—that’s different; you’ve sworn to love, honour, and endure\nhim: I haven’t.”\n\n“I don’t see what’s wrong with Egbert,” protested Amanda.\n\n“Oh, I daresay the wrongness has been on my part,” admitted Laura\ndispassionately; “he has merely been the extenuating circumstance.  He\nmade a thin, peevish kind of fuss, for instance, when I took the collie\npuppies from the farm out for a run the other day.”\n\n“They chased his young broods of speckled Sussex and drove two sitting\nhens off their nests, besides running all over the flower beds.  You know\nhow devoted he is to his poultry and garden.”\n\n“Anyhow, he needn’t have gone on about it for the entire evening and then\nhave said, ‘Let’s say no more about it’ just when I was beginning to\nenjoy the discussion.  That’s where one of my petty vindictive revenges\ncame in,” added Laura with an unrepentant chuckle; “I turned the entire\nfamily of speckled Sussex into his seedling shed the day after the puppy\nepisode.”\n\n“How could you?” exclaimed Amanda.\n\n“It came quite easy,” said Laura; “two of the hens pretended to be laying\nat the time, but I was firm.”\n\n“And we thought it was an accident!”\n\n“You see,” resumed Laura, “I really _have_ some grounds for supposing\nthat my next incarnation will be in a lower organism.  I shall be an\nanimal of some kind.  On the other hand, I haven’t been a bad sort in my\nway, so I think I may count on being a nice animal, something elegant and\nlively, with a love of fun.  An otter, perhaps.”\n\n“I can’t imagine you as an otter,” said Amanda.\n\n“Well, I don’t suppose you can imagine me as an angel, if it comes to\nthat,” said Laura.\n\nAmanda was silent.  She couldn’t.\n\n“Personally I think an otter life would be rather enjoyable,” continued\nLaura; “salmon to eat all the year round, and the satisfaction of being\nable to fetch the trout in their own homes without having to wait for\nhours till they condescend to rise to the fly you’ve been dangling before\nthem; and an elegant svelte figure—”\n\n“Think of the otter hounds,” interposed Amanda; “how dreadful to be\nhunted and harried and finally worried to death!”\n\n“Rather fun with half the neighbourhood looking on, and anyhow not worse\nthan this Saturday-to-Tuesday business of dying by inches; and then I\nshould go on into something else.  If I had been a moderately good otter\nI suppose I should get back into human shape of some sort; probably\nsomething rather primitive—a little brown, unclothed Nubian boy, I should\nthink.”\n\n“I wish you would be serious,” sighed Amanda; “you really ought to be if\nyou’re only going to live till Tuesday.”\n\nAs a matter of fact Laura died on Monday.\n\n“So dreadfully upsetting,” Amanda complained to her uncle-in-law, Sir\nLulworth Quayne.  “I’ve asked quite a lot of people down for golf and\nfishing, and the rhododendrons are just looking their best.”\n\n“Laura always was inconsiderate,” said Sir Lulworth; “she was born during\nGoodwood week, with an Ambassador staying in the house who hated babies.”\n\n“She had the maddest kind of ideas,” said Amanda; “do you know if there\nwas any insanity in her family?”\n\n“Insanity?  No, I never heard of any.  Her father lives in West\nKensington, but I believe he’s sane on all other subjects.”\n\n“She had an idea that she was going to be reincarnated as an otter,” said\nAmanda.\n\n“One meets with those ideas of reincarnation so frequently, even in the\nWest,” said Sir Lulworth, “that one can hardly set them down as being\nmad.  And Laura was such an unaccountable person in this life that I\nshould not like to lay down definite rules as to what she might be doing\nin an after state.”\n\n“You think she really might have passed into some animal form?” asked\nAmanda.  She was one of those who shape their opinions rather readily\nfrom the standpoint of those around them.\n\nJust then Egbert entered the breakfast-room, wearing an air of\nbereavement that Laura’s demise would have been insufficient, in itself,\nto account for.\n\n“Four of my speckled Sussex have been killed,” he exclaimed; “the very\nfour that were to go to the show on Friday.  One of them was dragged away\nand eaten right in the middle of that new carnation bed that I’ve been to\nsuch trouble and expense over.  My best flower bed and my best fowls\nsingled out for destruction; it almost seems as if the brute that did the\ndeed had special knowledge how to be as devastating as possible in a\nshort space of time.”\n\n“Was it a fox, do you think?” asked Amanda.\n\n“Sounds more like a polecat,” said Sir Lulworth.\n\n“No,” said Egbert, “there were marks of webbed feet all over the place,\nand we followed the tracks down to the stream at the bottom of the\ngarden; evidently an otter.”\n\nAmanda looked quickly and furtively across at Sir Lulworth.\n\nEgbert was too agitated to eat any breakfast, and went out to superintend\nthe strengthening of the poultry yard defences.\n\n“I think she might at least have waited till the funeral was over,” said\nAmanda in a scandalised voice.\n\n“It’s her own funeral, you know,” said Sir Lulworth; “it’s a nice point\nin etiquette how far one ought to show respect to one’s own mortal\nremains.”\n\nDisregard for mortuary convention was carried to further lengths next\nday; during the absence of the family at the funeral ceremony the\nremaining survivors of the speckled Sussex were massacred.  The\nmarauder’s line of retreat seemed to have embraced most of the flower\nbeds on the lawn, but the strawberry beds in the lower garden had also\nsuffered.\n\n“I shall get the otter hounds to come here at the earliest possible\nmoment,” said Egbert savagely.\n\n“On no account!  You can’t dream of such a thing!” exclaimed Amanda.  “I\nmean, it wouldn’t do, so soon after a funeral in the house.”\n\n“It’s a case of necessity,” said Egbert; “once an otter takes to that\nsort of thing it won’t stop.”\n\n“Perhaps it will go elsewhere now there are no more fowls left,”\nsuggested Amanda.\n\n“One would think you wanted to shield the beast,” said Egbert.\n\n“There’s been so little water in the stream lately,” objected Amanda; “it\nseems hardly sporting to hunt an animal when it has so little chance of\ntaking refuge anywhere.”\n\n“Good gracious!” fumed Egbert, “I’m not thinking about sport.  I want to\nhave the animal killed as soon as possible.”\n\nEven Amanda’s opposition weakened when, during church time on the\nfollowing Sunday, the otter made its way into the house, raided half a\nsalmon from the larder and worried it into scaly fragments on the Persian\nrug in Egbert’s studio.\n\n“We shall have it hiding under our beds and biting pieces out of our feet\nbefore long,” said Egbert, and from what Amanda knew of this particular\notter she felt that the possibility was not a remote one.\n\nOn the evening preceding the day fixed for the hunt Amanda spent a\nsolitary hour walking by the banks of the stream, making what she\nimagined to be hound noises.  It was charitably supposed by those who\noverheard her performance, that she was practising for farmyard\nimitations at the forth-coming village entertainment.\n\nIt was her friend and neighbour, Aurora Burret, who brought her news of\nthe day’s sport.\n\n“Pity you weren’t out; we had quite a good day.  We found at once, in the\npool just below your garden.”\n\n“Did you—kill?” asked Amanda.\n\n“Rather.  A fine she-otter.  Your husband got rather badly bitten in\ntrying to ‘tail it.’  Poor beast, I felt quite sorry for it, it had such\na human look in its eyes when it was killed.  You’ll call me silly, but\ndo you know who the look reminded me of?  My dear woman, what is the\nmatter?”\n\nWhen Amanda had recovered to a certain extent from her attack of nervous\nprostration Egbert took her to the Nile Valley to recuperate.  Change of\nscene speedily brought about the desired recovery of health and mental\nbalance.  The escapades of an adventurous otter in search of a variation\nof diet were viewed in their proper light.  Amanda’s normally placid\ntemperament reasserted itself.  Even a hurricane of shouted curses,\ncoming from her husband’s dressing-room, in her husband’s voice, but\nhardly in his usual vocabulary, failed to disturb her serenity as she\nmade a leisurely toilet one evening in a Cairo hotel.\n\n“What is the matter?  What has happened?” she asked in amused curiosity.\n\n“The little beast has thrown all my clean shirts into the bath!  Wait\ntill I catch you, you little—”\n\n“What little beast?” asked Amanda, suppressing a desire to laugh;\nEgbert’s language was so hopelessly inadequate to express his outraged\nfeelings.\n\n“A little beast of a naked brown Nubian boy,” spluttered Egbert.\n\nAnd now Amanda is seriously ill.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOAR-PIG\n\n\n“There is a back way on to the lawn,” said Mrs. Philidore Stossen to her\ndaughter, “through a small grass paddock and then through a walled fruit\ngarden full of gooseberry bushes.  I went all over the place last year\nwhen the family were away.  There is a door that opens from the fruit\ngarden into a shrubbery, and once we emerge from there we can mingle with\nthe guests as if we had come in by the ordinary way.  It’s much safer\nthan going in by the front entrance and running the risk of coming bang\nup against the hostess; that would be so awkward when she doesn’t happen\nto have invited us.”\n\n“Isn’t it a lot of trouble to take for getting admittance to a garden\nparty?”\n\n“To a garden party, yes; to _the_ garden party of the season, certainly\nnot.  Every one of any consequence in the county, with the exception of\nourselves, has been asked to meet the Princess, and it would be far more\ntroublesome to invent explanations as to why we weren’t there than to get\nin by a roundabout way.  I stopped Mrs. Cuvering in the road yesterday\nand talked very pointedly about the Princess.  If she didn’t choose to\ntake the hint and send me an invitation it’s not my fault, is it?  Here\nwe are: we just cut across the grass and through that little gate into\nthe garden.”\n\nMrs. Stossen and her daughter, suitably arrayed for a county garden party\nfunction with an infusion of Almanack de Gotha, sailed through the narrow\ngrass paddock and the ensuing gooseberry garden with the air of state\nbarges making an unofficial progress along a rural trout stream.  There\nwas a certain amount of furtive haste mingled with the stateliness of\ntheir advance, as though hostile search-lights might be turned on them at\nany moment; and, as a matter of fact, they were not unobserved.  Matilda\nCuvering, with the alert eyes of thirteen years old and the added\nadvantage of an exalted position in the branches of a medlar tree, had\nenjoyed a good view of the Stossen flanking movement and had foreseen\nexactly where it would break down in execution.\n\n“They’ll find the door locked, and they’ll jolly well have to go back the\nway they came,” she remarked to herself.  “Serves them right for not\ncoming in by the proper entrance.  What a pity Tarquin Superbus isn’t\nloose in the paddock.  After all, as every one else is enjoying\nthemselves, I don’t see why Tarquin shouldn’t have an afternoon out.”\n\nMatilda was of an age when thought is action; she slid down from the\nbranches of the medlar tree, and when she clambered back again Tarquin,\nthe huge white Yorkshire boar-pig, had exchanged the narrow limits of his\nstye for the wider range of the grass paddock.  The discomfited Stossen\nexpedition, returning in recriminatory but otherwise orderly retreat from\nthe unyielding obstacle of the locked door, came to a sudden halt at the\ngate dividing the paddock from the gooseberry garden.\n\n“What a villainous-looking animal,” exclaimed Mrs. Stossen; “it wasn’t\nthere when we came in.”\n\n“It’s there now, anyhow,” said her daughter.  “What on earth are we to\ndo?  I wish we had never come.”\n\nThe boar-pig had drawn nearer to the gate for a closer inspection of the\nhuman intruders, and stood champing his jaws and blinking his small red\neyes in a manner that was doubtless intended to be disconcerting, and, as\nfar as the Stossens were concerned, thoroughly achieved that result.\n\n“Shoo!  Hish!  Hish!  Shoo!” cried the ladies in chorus.\n\n“If they think they’re going to drive him away by reciting lists of the\nkings of Israel and Judah they’re laying themselves out for\ndisappointment,” observed Matilda from her seat in the medlar tree.  As\nshe made the observation aloud Mrs. Stossen became for the first time\naware of her presence.  A moment or two earlier she would have been\nanything but pleased at the discovery that the garden was not as deserted\nas it looked, but now she hailed the fact of the child’s presence on the\nscene with absolute relief.\n\n“Little girl, can you find some one to drive away—” she began hopefully.\n\n“_Comment_?  _Comprends pas_,” was the response.\n\n“Oh, are you French?  _Êtes vous française_?”\n\n“_Pas de tous_.  _’Suis anglaise_.”\n\n“Then why not talk English?  I want to know if—”\n\n“_Permettez-moi expliquer_.  You see, I’m rather under a cloud,” said\nMatilda.  “I’m staying with my aunt, and I was told I must behave\nparticularly well to-day, as lots of people were coming for a garden\nparty, and I was told to imitate Claude, that’s my young cousin, who\nnever does anything wrong except by accident, and then is always\napologetic about it.  It seems they thought I ate too much raspberry\ntrifle at lunch, and they said Claude never eats too much raspberry\ntrifle.  Well, Claude always goes to sleep for half an hour after lunch,\nbecause he’s told to, and I waited till he was asleep, and tied his hands\nand started forcible feeding with a whole bucketful of raspberry trifle\nthat they were keeping for the garden-party.  Lots of it went on to his\nsailor-suit and some of it on to the bed, but a good deal went down\nClaude’s throat, and they can’t say again that he has never been known to\neat too much raspberry trifle.  That is why I am not allowed to go to the\nparty, and as an additional punishment I must speak French all the\nafternoon.  I’ve had to tell you all this in English, as there were words\nlike ‘forcible feeding’ that I didn’t know the French for; of course I\ncould have invented them, but if I had said _nourriture obligatoire_ you\nwouldn’t have had the least idea what I was talking about.  _Mais\nmaintenant_, _nous parlons français_.”\n\n“Oh, very well, _trés bien_,” said Mrs. Stossen reluctantly; in moments\nof flurry such French as she knew was not under very good control.\n“_Là_, _à l’autre côté de la porte_, _est un cochon_—”\n\n“_Un cochon_? _Ah_, _le petit charmant_!” exclaimed Matilda with\nenthusiasm.\n\n“_Mais non_, _pas du tout petit_, _et pas du tout charmant_; _un bête\nféroce_—”\n\n“_Une bête_,” corrected Matilda; “a pig is masculine as long as you call\nit a pig, but if you lose your temper with it and call it a ferocious\nbeast it becomes one of us at once.  French is a dreadfully unsexing\nlanguage.”\n\n“For goodness’ sake let us talk English then,” said Mrs. Stossen.  “Is\nthere any way out of this garden except through the paddock where the pig\nis?”\n\n“I always go over the wall, by way of the plum tree,” said Matilda.\n\n“Dressed as we are we could hardly do that,” said Mrs. Stossen; it was\ndifficult to imagine her doing it in any costume.\n\n“Do you think you could go and get some one who would drive the pig\naway?” asked Miss Stossen.\n\n“I promised my aunt I would stay here till five o’clock; it’s not four\nyet.”\n\n“I am sure, under the circumstances, your aunt would permit—”\n\n“My conscience would not permit,” said Matilda with cold dignity.\n\n“We can’t stay here till five o’clock,” exclaimed Mrs. Stossen with\ngrowing exasperation.\n\n“Shall I recite to you to make the time pass quicker?” asked Matilda\nobligingly.  “‘Belinda, the little Breadwinner,’ is considered my best\npiece, or, perhaps, it ought to be something in French.  Henri Quatre’s\naddress to his soldiers is the only thing I really know in that\nlanguage.”\n\n“If you will go and fetch some one to drive that animal away I will give\nyou something to buy yourself a nice present,” said Mrs. Stossen.\n\nMatilda came several inches lower down the medlar tree.\n\n“That is the most practical suggestion you have made yet for getting out\nof the garden,” she remarked cheerfully; “Claude and I are collecting\nmoney for the Children’s Fresh Air Fund, and we are seeing which of us\ncan collect the biggest sum.”\n\n“I shall be very glad to contribute half a crown, very glad indeed,” said\nMrs. Stossen, digging that coin out of the depths of a receptacle which\nformed a detached outwork of her toilet.\n\n“Claude is a long way ahead of me at present,” continued Matilda, taking\nno notice of the suggested offering; “you see, he’s only eleven, and has\ngolden hair, and those are enormous advantages when you’re on the\ncollecting job.  Only the other day a Russian lady gave him ten\nshillings.  Russians understand the art of giving far better than we do.\nI expect Claude will net quite twenty-five shillings this afternoon;\nhe’ll have the field to himself, and he’ll be able to do the pale,\nfragile, not-long-for-this-world business to perfection after his\nraspberry trifle experience.  Yes, he’ll be _quite_ two pounds ahead of\nme by now.”\n\nWith much probing and plucking and many regretful murmurs the beleaguered\nladies managed to produce seven-and-sixpence between them.\n\n“I am afraid this is all we’ve got,” said Mrs. Stossen.\n\nMatilda showed no sign of coming down either to the earth or to their\nfigure.\n\n“I could not do violence to my conscience for anything less than ten\nshillings,” she announced stiffly.\n\nMother and daughter muttered certain remarks under their breath, in which\nthe word “beast” was prominent, and probably had no reference to Tarquin.\n\n“I find I _have_ got another half-crown,” said Mrs. Stossen in a shaking\nvoice; “here you are.  Now please fetch some one quickly.”\n\nMatilda slipped down from the tree, took possession of the donation, and\nproceeded to pick up a handful of over-ripe medlars from the grass at her\nfeet.  Then she climbed over the gate and addressed herself\naffectionately to the boar-pig.\n\n“Come, Tarquin, dear old boy; you know you can’t resist medlars when\nthey’re rotten and squashy.”\n\nTarquin couldn’t.  By dint of throwing the fruit in front of him at\njudicious intervals Matilda decoyed him back to his stye, while the\ndelivered captives hurried across the paddock.\n\n“Well, I never!  The little minx!” exclaimed Mrs. Stossen when she was\nsafely on the high road.  “The animal wasn’t savage at all, and as for\nthe ten shillings, I don’t believe the Fresh Air Fund will see a penny of\nit!”\n\nThere she was unwarrantably harsh in her judgment.  If you examine the\nbooks of the fund you will find the acknowledgment: “Collected by Miss\nMatilda Cuvering, 2s. 6d.”\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROGUE\n\n\nThe hunting season had come to an end, and the Mullets had not succeeded\nin selling the Brogue.  There had been a kind of tradition in the family\nfor the past three or four years, a sort of fatalistic hope, that the\nBrogue would find a purchaser before the hunting was over; but seasons\ncame and went without anything happening to justify such ill-founded\noptimism.  The animal had been named Berserker in the earlier stages of\nits career; it had been rechristened the Brogue later on, in recognition\nof the fact that, once acquired, it was extremely difficult to get rid\nof.  The unkinder wits of the neighbourhood had been known to suggest\nthat the first letter of its name was superfluous.  The Brogue had been\nvariously described in sale catalogues as a light-weight hunter, a lady’s\nhack, and, more simply, but still with a touch of imagination, as a\nuseful brown gelding, standing 15.1.  Toby Mullet had ridden him for four\nseasons with the West Wessex; you can ride almost any sort of horse with\nthe West Wessex as long as it is an animal that knows the country.  The\nBrogue knew the country intimately, having personally created most of the\ngaps that were to be met with in banks and hedges for many miles round.\nHis manners and characteristics were not ideal in the hunting field, but\nhe was probably rather safer to ride to hounds than he was as a hack on\ncountry roads.  According to the Mullet family, he was not really\nroad-shy, but there were one or two objects of dislike that brought on\nsudden attacks of what Toby called the swerving sickness.  Motors and\ncycles he treated with tolerant disregard, but pigs, wheelbarrows, piles\nof stones by the roadside, perambulators in a village street, gates\npainted too aggressively white, and sometimes, but not always, the newer\nkind of beehives, turned him aside from his tracks in vivid imitation of\nthe zigzag course of forked lightning.  If a pheasant rose noisily from\nthe other side of a hedgerow the Brogue would spring into the air at the\nsame moment, but this may have been due to a desire to be companionable.\nThe Mullet family contradicted the widely prevalent report that the horse\nwas a confirmed crib-biter.\n\nIt was about the third week in May that Mrs. Mullet, relict of the late\nSylvester Mullet, and mother of Toby and a bunch of daughters, assailed\nClovis Sangrail on the outskirts of the village with a breathless\ncatalogue of local happenings.\n\n“You know our new neighbour, Mr. Penricarde?” she vociferated; “awfully\nrich, owns tin mines in Cornwall, middle-aged and rather quiet.  He’s\ntaken the Red House on a long lease and spent a lot of money on\nalterations and improvements.  Well, Toby’s sold him the Brogue!”\n\nClovis spent a moment or two in assimilating the astonishing news; then\nhe broke out into unstinted congratulation.  If he had belonged to a more\nemotional race he would probably have kissed Mrs. Mullet.\n\n“How wonderfully lucky to have pulled it off at last!  Now you can buy a\ndecent animal.  I’ve always said that Toby was clever.  Ever so many\ncongratulations.”\n\n“Don’t congratulate me.  It’s the most unfortunate thing that could have\nhappened!” said Mrs. Mullet dramatically.\n\nClovis stared at her in amazement.\n\n“Mr. Penricarde,” said Mrs. Mullet, sinking her voice to what she\nimagined to be an impressive whisper, though it rather resembled a\nhoarse, excited squeak, “Mr. Penricarde has just begun to pay attentions\nto Jessie.  Slight at first, but now unmistakable.  I was a fool not to\nhave seen it sooner.  Yesterday, at the Rectory garden party, he asked\nher what her favourite flowers were, and she told him carnations, and\nto-day a whole stack of carnations has arrived, clove and malmaison and\nlovely dark red ones, regular exhibition blooms, and a box of chocolates\nthat he must have got on purpose from London.  And he’s asked her to go\nround the links with him to-morrow.  And now, just at this critical\nmoment, Toby has sold him that animal.  It’s a calamity!”\n\n“But you’ve been trying to get the horse off your hands for years,” said\nClovis.\n\n“I’ve got a houseful of daughters,” said Mrs. Mullet, “and I’ve been\ntrying—well, not to get them off my hands, of course, but a husband or\ntwo wouldn’t be amiss among the lot of them; there are six of them, you\nknow.”\n\n“I don’t know,” said Clovis, “I’ve never counted, but I expect you’re\nright as to the number; mothers generally know these things.”\n\n“And now,” continued Mrs. Mullet, in her tragic whisper, “when there’s a\nrich husband-in-prospect imminent on the horizon Toby goes and sells him\nthat miserable animal.  It will probably kill him if he tries to ride it;\nanyway it will kill any affection he might have felt towards any member\nof our family.  What is to be done?  We can’t very well ask to have the\nhorse back; you see, we praised it up like anything when we thought there\nwas a chance of his buying it, and said it was just the animal to suit\nhim.”\n\n“Couldn’t you steal it out of his stable and send it to grass at some\nfarm miles away?” suggested Clovis; “write ‘Votes for Women’ on the\nstable door, and the thing would pass for a Suffragette outrage.  No one\nwho knew the horse could possibly suspect you of wanting to get it back\nagain.”\n\n“Every newspaper in the country would ring with the affair,” said Mrs.\nMullet; “can’t you imagine the headline, ‘Valuable Hunter Stolen by\nSuffragettes’?  The police would scour the countryside till they found\nthe animal.”\n\n“Well, Jessie must try and get it back from Penricarde on the plea that\nit’s an old favourite.  She can say it was only sold because the stable\nhad to be pulled down under the terms of an old repairing lease, and that\nnow it has been arranged that the stable is to stand for a couple of\nyears longer.”\n\n“It sounds a queer proceeding to ask for a horse back when you’ve just\nsold him,” said Mrs. Mullet, “but something must be done, and done at\nonce.  The man is not used to horses, and I believe I told him it was as\nquiet as a lamb.  After all, lambs go kicking and twisting about as if\nthey were demented, don’t they?”\n\n“The lamb has an entirely unmerited character for sedateness,” agreed\nClovis.\n\nJessie came back from the golf links next day in a state of mingled\nelation and concern.\n\n“It’s all right about the proposal,” she announced; “he came out with it\nat the sixth hole.  I said I must have time to think it over.  I accepted\nhim at the seventh.”\n\n“My dear,” said her mother, “I think a little more maidenly reserve and\nhesitation would have been advisable, as you’ve known him so short a\ntime.  You might have waited till the ninth hole.”\n\n“The seventh is a very long hole,” said Jessie; “besides, the tension was\nputting us both off our game.  By the time we’d got to the ninth hole\nwe’d settled lots of things.  The honeymoon is to be spent in Corsica,\nwith perhaps a flying visit to Naples if we feel like it, and a week in\nLondon to wind up with.  Two of his nieces are to be asked to be\nbridesmaids, so with our lot there will be seven, which is rather a lucky\nnumber.  You are to wear your pearl grey, with any amount of Honiton lace\njabbed into it.  By the way, he’s coming over this evening to ask your\nconsent to the whole affair.  So far all’s well, but about the Brogue\nit’s a different matter.  I told him the legend about the stable, and how\nkeen we were about buying the horse back, but he seems equally keen on\nkeeping it.  He said he must have horse exercise now that he’s living in\nthe country, and he’s going to start riding to-morrow.  He’s ridden a few\ntimes in the Row, on an animal that was accustomed to carry octogenarians\nand people undergoing rest cures, and that’s about all his experience in\nthe saddle—oh, and he rode a pony once in Norfolk, when he was fifteen\nand the pony twenty-four; and to-morrow he’s going to ride the Brogue!  I\nshall be a widow before I’m married, and I do so want to see what\nCorsica’s like; it looks so silly on the map.”\n\nClovis was sent for in haste, and the developments of the situation put\nbefore him.\n\n“Nobody can ride that animal with any safety,” said Mrs. Mullet, “except\nToby, and he knows by long experience what it is going to shy at, and\nmanages to swerve at the same time.”\n\n“I did hint to Mr. Penricarde—to Vincent, I should say—that the Brogue\ndidn’t like white gates,” said Jessie.\n\n“White gates!” exclaimed Mrs. Mullet; “did you mention what effect a pig\nhas on him?  He’ll have to go past Lockyer’s farm to get to the high\nroad, and there’s sure to be a pig or two grunting about in the lane.”\n\n“He’s taken rather a dislike to turkeys lately,” said Toby.\n\n“It’s obvious that Penricarde mustn’t be allowed to go out on that\nanimal,” said Clovis, “at least not till Jessie has married him, and\ntired of him.  I tell you what: ask him to a picnic to-morrow, starting\nat an early hour; he’s not the sort to go out for a ride before\nbreakfast.  The day after I’ll get the rector to drive him over to\nCrowleigh before lunch, to see the new cottage hospital they’re building\nthere.  The Brogue will be standing idle in the stable and Toby can offer\nto exercise it; then it can pick up a stone or something of the sort and\ngo conveniently lame.  If you hurry on the wedding a bit the lameness\nfiction can be kept up till the ceremony is safely over.”\n\nMrs. Mullet belonged to an emotional race, and she kissed Clovis.\n\nIt was nobody’s fault that the rain came down in torrents the next\nmorning, making a picnic a fantastic impossibility.  It was also nobody’s\nfault, but sheer ill-luck, that the weather cleared up sufficiently in\nthe afternoon to tempt Mr. Penricarde to make his first essay with the\nBrogue.  They did not get as far as the pigs at Lockyer’s farm; the\nrectory gate was painted a dull unobtrusive green, but it had been white\na year or two ago, and the Brogue never forgot that he had been in the\nhabit of making a violent curtsey, a back-pedal and a swerve at this\nparticular point of the road.  Subsequently, there being apparently no\nfurther call on his services, he broke his way into the rectory orchard,\nwhere he found a hen turkey in a coop; later visitors to the orchard\nfound the coop almost intact, but very little left of the turkey.\n\nMr. Penricarde, a little stunned and shaken, and suffering from a bruised\nknee and some minor damages, good-naturedly ascribed the accident to his\nown inexperience with horses and country roads, and allowed Jessie to\nnurse him back into complete recovery and golf-fitness within something\nless than a week.\n\nIn the list of wedding presents which the local newspaper published a\nfortnight or so later appeared the following item:\n\n“Brown saddle-horse, ‘The Brogue,’ bridegroom’s gift to bride.”\n\n“Which shows,” said Toby Mullet, “that he knew nothing.”\n\n“Or else,” said Clovis, “that he has a very pleasing wit.”\n\n\n\n\nTHE HEN\n\n\n“Dora Bittholz is coming on Thursday,” said Mrs. Sangrail.\n\n“This next Thursday?” asked Clovis\n\nHis mother nodded.\n\n“You’ve rather done it, haven’t you?” he chuckled; “Jane Martlet has only\nbeen here five days, and she never stays less than a fortnight, even when\nshe’s asked definitely for a week.  You’ll never get her out of the house\nby Thursday.”\n\n“Why should I?” asked Mrs. Sangrail; “she and Dora are good friends,\naren’t they?  They used to be, as far as I remember.”\n\n“They used to be; that’s what makes them all the more bitter now.  Each\nfeels that she has nursed a viper in her bosom.  Nothing fans the flame\nof human resentment so much as the discovery that one’s bosom has been\nutilised as a snake sanatorium.”\n\n“But what has happened?  Has some one been making mischief?”\n\n“Not exactly,” said Clovis; “a hen came between them.”\n\n“A hen?  What hen?”\n\n“It was a bronze Leghorn or some such exotic breed, and Dora sold it to\nJane at a rather exotic price.  They both go in for prize poultry, you\nknow, and Jane thought she was going to get her money back in a large\nfamily of pedigree chickens.  The bird turned out to be an abstainer from\nthe egg habit, and I’m told that the letters which passed between the two\nwomen were a revelation as to how much invective could be got on to a\nsheet of notepaper.”\n\n“How ridiculous!” said Mrs. Sangrail.  “Couldn’t some of their friends\ncompose the quarrel?”\n\n“People tried,” said Clovis, “but it must have been rather like composing\nthe storm music of the ‘Fliegende Holländer.’  Jane was willing to take\nback some of her most libellous remarks if Dora would take back the hen,\nbut Dora said that would be owning herself in the wrong, and you know\nshe’d as soon think of owning slum property in Whitechapel as do that.”\n\n“It’s a most awkward situation,” said Mrs. Sangrail.  “Do you suppose\nthey won’t speak to one another?”\n\n“On the contrary, the difficulty will be to get them to leave off.  Their\nremarks on each other’s conduct and character have hitherto been governed\nby the fact that only four ounces of plain speaking can be sent through\nthe post for a penny.”\n\n“I can’t put Dora off,” said Mrs. Sangrail.  “I’ve already postponed her\nvisit once, and nothing short of a miracle would make Jane leave before\nher self-allotted fortnight is over.”\n\n“Miracles are rather in my line,” said Clovis.  “I don’t pretend to be\nvery hopeful in this case but I’ll do my best.”\n\n“As long as you don’t drag me into it—” stipulated his mother.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n“Servants are a bit of a nuisance,” muttered Clovis, as he sat in the\nsmoking-room after lunch, talking fitfully to Jane Martlet in the\nintervals of putting together the materials of a cocktail, which he had\nirreverently patented under the name of an Ella Wheeler Wilcox.  It was\npartly compounded of old brandy and partly of curaçoa; there were other\ningredients, but they were never indiscriminately revealed.\n\n“Servants a nuisance!” exclaimed Jane, bounding into the topic with the\nexuberant plunge of a hunter when it leaves the high road and feels turf\nunder its hoofs; “I should think they were!  The trouble I’ve had in\ngetting suited this year you would hardly believe.  But I don’t see what\nyou have to complain of—your mother is so wonderfully lucky in her\nservants.  Sturridge, for instance—he’s been with you for years, and I’m\nsure he’s a paragon as butlers go.”\n\n“That’s just the trouble,” said Clovis.  “It’s when servants have been\nwith you for years that they become a really serious nuisance.  The ‘here\nto-day and gone to-morrow’ sort don’t matter—you’ve simply got to replace\nthem; it’s the stayers and the paragons that are the real worry.”\n\n“But if they give satisfaction—”\n\n“That doesn’t prevent them from giving trouble.  Now, you’ve mentioned\nSturridge—it was Sturridge I was particularly thinking of when I made the\nobservation about servants being a nuisance.”\n\n“The excellent Sturridge a nuisance!  I can’t believe it.”\n\n“I know he’s excellent, and we just couldn’t get along without him; he’s\nthe one reliable element in this rather haphazard household.  But his\nvery orderliness has had an effect on him.  Have you ever considered what\nit must be like to go on unceasingly doing the correct thing in the\ncorrect manner in the same surroundings for the greater part of a\nlifetime?  To know and ordain and superintend exactly what silver and\nglass and table linen shall be used and set out on what occasions, to\nhave cellar and pantry and plate-cupboard under a minutely devised and\nundeviating administration, to be noiseless, impalpable, omnipresent,\nand, as far as your own department is concerned, omniscient?”\n\n“I should go mad,” said Jane with conviction.\n\n“Exactly,” said Clovis thoughtfully, swallowing his completed Ella\nWheeler Wilcox.\n\n“But Sturridge hasn’t gone mad,” said Jane with a flutter of inquiry in\nher voice.\n\n“On most points he’s thoroughly sane and reliable,” said Clovis, “but at\ntimes he is subject to the most obstinate delusions, and on those\noccasions he becomes not merely a nuisance but a decided embarrassment.”\n\n“What sort of delusions?”\n\n“Unfortunately they usually centre round one of the guests of the house\nparty, and that is where the awkwardness comes in.  For instance, he took\nit into his head that Matilda Sheringham was the Prophet Elijah, and as\nall that he remembered about Elijah’s history was the episode of the\nravens in the wilderness he absolutely declined to interfere with what he\nimagined to be Matilda’s private catering arrangements, wouldn’t allow\nany tea to be sent up to her in the morning, and if he was waiting at\ntable he passed her over altogether in handing round the dishes.”\n\n“How very unpleasant.  Whatever did you do about it?”\n\n“Oh, Matilda got fed, after a fashion, but it was judged to be best for\nher to cut her visit short.  It was really the only thing to be done,”\nsaid Clovis with some emphasis.\n\n“I shouldn’t have done that,” said Jane, “I should have humoured him in\nsome way.  I certainly shouldn’t have gone away.”\n\nClovis frowned.\n\n“It is not always wise to humour people when they get these ideas into\ntheir heads.  There’s no knowing to what lengths they may go if you\nencourage them.”\n\n“You don’t mean to say he might be dangerous, do you?” asked Jane with\nsome anxiety.\n\n“One can never be certain,” said Clovis; “now and then he gets some idea\nabout a guest which might take an unfortunate turn.  That is precisely\nwhat is worrying me at the present moment.”\n\n“What, has he taken a fancy about some one here now?” asked Jane\nexcitedly; “how thrilling!  Do tell me who it is.”\n\n“You,” said Clovis briefly.\n\n“Me?”\n\nClovis nodded.\n\n“Who on earth does he think I am?”\n\n“Queen Anne,” was the unexpected answer.\n\n“Queen Anne!  What an idea.  But, anyhow, there’s nothing dangerous about\nher; she’s such a colourless personality.”\n\n“What does posterity chiefly say about Queen Anne?” asked Clovis rather\nsternly.\n\n“The only thing that I can remember about her,” said Jane, “is the saying\n‘Queen Anne’s dead.’”\n\n“Exactly,” said Clovis, staring at the glass that had held the Ella\nWheeler Wilcox, “dead.”\n\n“Do you mean he takes me for the ghost of Queen Anne?” asked Jane.\n\n“Ghost?  Dear no.  No one ever heard of a ghost that came down to\nbreakfast and ate kidneys and toast and honey with a healthy appetite.\nNo, it’s the fact of you being so very much alive and flourishing that\nperplexes and annoys him.  All his life he has been accustomed to look on\nQueen Anne as the personification of everything that is dead and done\nwith, ‘as dead as Queen Anne,’ you know; and now he has to fill your\nglass at lunch and dinner and listen to your accounts of the gay time you\nhad at the Dublin Horse Show, and naturally he feels that something’s\nvery wrong with you.”\n\n“But he wouldn’t be downright hostile to me on that account, would he?”\nJane asked anxiously.\n\n“I didn’t get really alarmed about it till lunch to-day,” said Clovis; “I\ncaught him glowering at you with a very sinister look and muttering:\n‘Ought to be dead long ago, she ought, and some one should see to it.’\nThat’s why I mentioned the matter to you.”\n\n“This is awful,” said Jane; “your mother must be told about it at once.”\n\n“My mother mustn’t hear a word about it,” said Clovis earnestly; “it\nwould upset her dreadfully.  She relies on Sturridge for everything.”\n\n“But he might kill me at any moment,” protested Jane.\n\n“Not at any moment; he’s busy with the silver all the afternoon.”\n\n“You’ll have to keep a sharp look-out all the time and be on your guard\nto frustrate any murderous attack,” said Jane, adding in a tone of weak\nobstinacy: “It’s a dreadful situation to be in, with a mad butler\ndangling over you like the sword of What’s-his-name, but I’m certainly\nnot going to cut my visit short.”\n\nClovis swore horribly under his breath; the miracle was an obvious\nmisfire.\n\nIt was in the hall the next morning after a late breakfast that Clovis\nhad his final inspiration as he stood engaged in coaxing rust spots from\nan old putter.\n\n“Where is Miss Martlet?” he asked the butler, who was at that moment\ncrossing the hall.\n\n“Writing letters in the morning-room, sir,” said Sturridge, announcing a\nfact of which his questioner was already aware.\n\n“She wants to copy the inscription on that old basket-hilted sabre,” said\nClovis, pointing to a venerable weapon hanging on the wall.  “I wish\nyou’d take it to her; my hands are all over oil.  Take it without the\nsheath, it will be less trouble.”\n\nThe butler drew the blade, still keen and bright in its well-cared for\nold age, and carried it into the morning-room.  There was a door near the\nwriting-table leading to a back stairway; Jane vanished through it with\nsuch lightning rapidity that the butler doubted whether she had seen him\ncome in.  Half an hour later Clovis was driving her and her\nhastily-packed luggage to the station.\n\n“Mother will be awfully vexed when she comes back from her ride and finds\nyou have gone,” he observed to the departing guest, “but I’ll make up\nsome story about an urgent wire having called you away.  It wouldn’t do\nto alarm her unnecessarily about Sturridge.”\n\nJane sniffed slightly at Clovis’ ideas of unnecessary alarm, and was\nalmost rude to the young man who came round with thoughtful inquiries as\nto luncheon-baskets.\n\nThe miracle lost some of its usefulness from the fact that Dora wrote the\nsame day postponing the date of her visit, but, at any rate, Clovis holds\nthe record as the only human being who ever hustled Jane Martlet out of\nthe time-table of her migrations.\n\n\n\n\nTHE OPEN WINDOW\n\n\n“My aunt will be down presently, Mr. Nuttel,” said a very self-possessed\nyoung lady of fifteen; “in the meantime you must try and put up with me.”\n\nFramton Nuttel endeavoured to say the correct something which should duly\nflatter the niece of the moment without unduly discounting the aunt that\nwas to come.  Privately he doubted more than ever whether these formal\nvisits on a succession of total strangers would do much towards helping\nthe nerve cure which he was supposed to be undergoing.\n\n“I know how it will be,” his sister had said when he was preparing to\nmigrate to this rural retreat; “you will bury yourself down there and not\nspeak to a living soul, and your nerves will be worse than ever from\nmoping.  I shall just give you letters of introduction to all the people\nI know there.  Some of them, as far as I can remember, were quite nice.”\n\nFramton wondered whether Mrs. Sappleton, the lady to whom he was\npresenting one of the letters of introduction, came into the nice\ndivision.\n\n“Do you know many of the people round here?” asked the niece, when she\njudged that they had had sufficient silent communion.\n\n“Hardly a soul,” said Framton.  “My sister was staying here, at the\nrectory, you know, some four years ago, and she gave me letters of\nintroduction to some of the people here.”\n\nHe made the last statement in a tone of distinct regret.\n\n“Then you know practically nothing about my aunt?” pursued the\nself-possessed young lady.\n\n“Only her name and address,” admitted the caller.  He was wondering\nwhether Mrs. Sappleton was in the married or widowed state.  An\nundefinable something about the room seemed to suggest masculine\nhabitation.\n\n“Her great tragedy happened just three years ago,” said the child; “that\nwould be since your sister’s time.”\n\n“Her tragedy?” asked Framton; somehow in this restful country spot\ntragedies seemed out of place.\n\n“You may wonder why we keep that window wide open on an October\nafternoon,” said the niece, indicating a large French window that opened\non to a lawn.\n\n“It is quite warm for the time of the year,” said Framton; “but has that\nwindow got anything to do with the tragedy?”\n\n“Out through that window, three years ago to a day, her husband and her\ntwo young brothers went off for their day’s shooting.  They never came\nback.  In crossing the moor to their favourite snipe-shooting ground they\nwere all three engulfed in a treacherous piece of bog.  It had been that\ndreadful wet summer, you know, and places that were safe in other years\ngave way suddenly without warning.  Their bodies were never recovered.\nThat was the dreadful part of it.”  Here the child’s voice lost its\nself-possessed note and became falteringly human.  “Poor aunt always\nthinks that they will come back some day, they and the little brown\nspaniel that was lost with them, and walk in at that window just as they\nused to do.  That is why the window is kept open every evening till it is\nquite dusk.  Poor dear aunt, she has often told me how they went out, her\nhusband with his white waterproof coat over his arm, and Ronnie, her\nyoungest brother, singing ‘Bertie, why do you bound?’ as he always did to\ntease her, because she said it got on her nerves.  Do you know, sometimes\non still, quiet evenings like this, I almost get a creepy feeling that\nthey will all walk in through that window—”\n\nShe broke off with a little shudder.  It was a relief to Framton when the\naunt bustled into the room with a whirl of apologies for being late in\nmaking her appearance.\n\n“I hope Vera has been amusing you?” she said.\n\n“She has been very interesting,” said Framton.\n\n“I hope you don’t mind the open window,” said Mrs. Sappleton briskly; “my\nhusband and brothers will be home directly from shooting, and they always\ncome in this way.  They’ve been out for snipe in the marshes to-day, so\nthey’ll make a fine mess over my poor carpets.  So like you men-folk,\nisn’t it?”\n\nShe rattled on cheerfully about the shooting and the scarcity of birds,\nand the prospects for duck in the winter.  To Framton it was all purely\nhorrible.  He made a desperate but only partially successful effort to\nturn the talk on to a less ghastly topic; he was conscious that his\nhostess was giving him only a fragment of her attention, and her eyes\nwere constantly straying past him to the open window and the lawn beyond.\nIt was certainly an unfortunate coincidence that he should have paid his\nvisit on this tragic anniversary.\n\n“The doctors agree in ordering me complete rest, an absence of mental\nexcitement, and avoidance of anything in the nature of violent physical\nexercise,” announced Framton, who laboured under the tolerably widespread\ndelusion that total strangers and chance acquaintances are hungry for the\nleast detail of one’s ailments and infirmities, their cause and cure.\n“On the matter of diet they are not so much in agreement,” he continued.\n\n“No?” said Mrs. Sappleton, in a voice which only replaced a yawn at the\nlast moment.  Then she suddenly brightened into alert attention—but not\nto what Framton was saying.\n\n“Here they are at last!” she cried.  “Just in time for tea, and don’t\nthey look as if they were muddy up to the eyes!”\n\nFramton shivered slightly and turned towards the niece with a look\nintended to convey sympathetic comprehension.  The child was staring out\nthrough the open window with dazed horror in her eyes.  In a chill shock\nof nameless fear Framton swung round in his seat and looked in the same\ndirection.\n\nIn the deepening twilight three figures were walking across the lawn\ntowards the window; they all carried guns under their arms, and one of\nthem was additionally burdened with a white coat hung over his shoulders.\nA tired brown spaniel kept close at their heels.  Noiselessly they neared\nthe house, and then a hoarse young voice chanted out of the dusk: “I\nsaid, Bertie, why do you bound?”\n\nFramton grabbed wildly at his stick and hat; the hall-door, the\ngravel-drive, and the front gate were dimly-noted stages in his headlong\nretreat.  A cyclist coming along the road had to run into the hedge to\navoid an imminent collision.\n\n“Here we are, my dear,” said the bearer of the white mackintosh, coming\nin through the window; “fairly muddy, but most of it’s dry.  Who was that\nwho bolted out as we came up?”\n\n“A most extraordinary man, a Mr. Nuttel,” said Mrs. Sappleton; “could\nonly talk about his illnesses, and dashed off without a word of good-bye\nor apology when you arrived.  One would think he had seen a ghost.”\n\n“I expect it was the spaniel,” said the niece calmly; “he told me he had\na horror of dogs.  He was once hunted into a cemetery somewhere on the\nbanks of the Ganges by a pack of pariah dogs, and had to spend the night\nin a newly dug grave with the creatures snarling and grinning and foaming\njust above him.  Enough to make anyone lose their nerve.”\n\nRomance at short notice was her speciality.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TREASURE SHIP\n\n\nThe great galleon lay in semi-retirement under the sand and weed and\nwater of the northern bay where the fortune of war and weather had long\nago ensconced it.  Three and a quarter centuries had passed since the day\nwhen it had taken the high seas as an important unit of a fighting\nsquadron—precisely which squadron the learned were not agreed.  The\ngalleon had brought nothing into the world, but it had, according to\ntradition and report, taken much out of it.  But how much?  There again\nthe learned were in disagreement.  Some were as generous in their\nestimate as an income-tax assessor, others applied a species of higher\ncriticism to the submerged treasure chests, and debased their contents to\nthe currency of goblin gold.  Of the former school was Lulu, Duchess of\nDulverton.\n\nThe Duchess was not only a believer in the existence of a sunken treasure\nof alluring proportions; she also believed that she knew of a method by\nwhich the said treasure might be precisely located and cheaply\ndisembedded.  An aunt on her mother’s side of the family had been Maid of\nHonour at the Court of Monaco, and had taken a respectful interest in the\ndeep-sea researches in which the Throne of that country, impatient\nperhaps of its terrestrial restrictions, was wont to immerse itself.  It\nwas through the instrumentality of this relative that the Duchess learned\nof an invention, perfected and very nearly patented by a Monegaskan\nsavant, by means of which the home-life of the Mediterranean sardine\nmight be studied at a depth of many fathoms in a cold white light of more\nthan ball-room brilliancy.  Implicated in this invention (and, in the\nDuchess’s eyes, the most attractive part of it) was an electric suction\ndredge, specially designed for dragging to the surface such objects of\ninterest and value as might be found in the more accessible levels of the\nocean-bed.  The rights of the invention were to be acquired for a matter\nof eighteen hundred francs, and the apparatus for a few thousand more.\nThe Duchess of Dulverton was rich, as the world counted wealth; she\nnursed the hope, of being one day rich at her own computation.  Companies\nhad been formed and efforts had been made again and again during the\ncourse of three centuries to probe for the alleged treasures of the\ninteresting galleon; with the aid of this invention she considered that\nshe might go to work on the wreck privately and independently.  After\nall, one of her ancestors on her mother’s side was descended from Medina\nSidonia, so she was of opinion that she had as much right to the treasure\nas anyone.  She acquired the invention and bought the apparatus.\n\nAmong other family ties and encumbrances, Lulu possessed a nephew, Vasco\nHoniton, a young gentleman who was blessed with a small income and a\nlarge circle of relatives, and lived impartially and precariously on\nboth.  The name Vasco had been given him possibly in the hope that he\nmight live up to its adventurous tradition, but he limited himself\nstrictly to the home industry of adventurer, preferring to exploit the\nassured rather than to explore the unknown.  Lulu’s intercourse with him\nhad been restricted of recent years to the negative processes of being\nout of town when he called on her, and short of money when he wrote to\nher.  Now, however, she bethought herself of his eminent suitability for\nthe direction of a treasure-seeking experiment; if anyone could extract\ngold from an unpromising situation it would certainly be Vasco—of course,\nunder the necessary safeguards in the way of supervision.  Where money\nwas in question Vasco’s conscience was liable to fits of obstinate\nsilence.\n\nSomewhere on the west coast of Ireland the Dulverton property included a\nfew acres of shingle, rock, and heather, too barren to support even an\nagrarian outrage, but embracing a small and fairly deep bay where the\nlobster yield was good in most seasons.  There was a bleak little house\non the property, and for those who liked lobsters and solitude, and were\nable to accept an Irish cook’s ideas as to what might be perpetrated in\nthe name of mayonnaise, Innisgluther was a tolerable exile during the\nsummer months.  Lulu seldom went there herself, but she lent the house\nlavishly to friends and relations.  She put it now at Vasco’s disposal.\n\n“It will be the very place to practise and experiment with the salvage\napparatus,” she said; “the bay is quite deep in places, and you will be\nable to test everything thoroughly before starting on the treasure hunt.”\n\nIn less than three weeks Vasco turned up in town to report progress.\n\n“The apparatus works beautifully,” he informed his aunt; “the deeper one\ngot the clearer everything grew.  We found something in the way of a\nsunken wreck to operate on, too!”\n\n“A wreck in Innisgluther Bay!” exclaimed Lulu.\n\n“A submerged motor-boat, the _Sub-Rosa_,” said Vasco.\n\n“No! really?” said Lulu; “poor Billy Yuttley’s boat.  I remember it went\ndown somewhere off that coast some three years ago.  His body was washed\nashore at the Point.  People said at the time that the boat was capsized\nintentionally—a case of suicide, you know.  People always say that sort\nof thing when anything tragic happens.”\n\n“In this case they were right,” said Vasco.\n\n“What do you mean?” asked the Duchess hurriedly.  “What makes you think\nso?”\n\n“I know,” said Vasco simply.\n\n“Know?  How can you know?  How can anyone know?  The thing happened three\nyears ago.”\n\n“In a locker of the _Sub-Rosa_ I found a water-tight strong-box.  It\ncontained papers.”  Vasco paused with dramatic effect and searched for a\nmoment in the inner breast-pocket of his coat.  He drew out a folded slip\nof paper.  The Duchess snatched at it in almost indecent haste and moved\nappreciably nearer the fireplace.\n\n“Was this in the _Sub-Rosa’s_ strong-box?” she asked.\n\n“Oh no,” said Vasco carelessly, “that is a list of the well-known people\nwho would be involved in a very disagreeable scandal if the _Sub-Rosa’s_\npapers were made public.  I’ve put you at the head of it, otherwise it\nfollows alphabetical order.”\n\nThe Duchess gazed helplessly at the string of names, which seemed for the\nmoment to include nearly every one she knew.  As a matter of fact, her\nown name at the head of the list exercised an almost paralysing effect on\nher thinking faculties.\n\n“Of course you have destroyed the papers?” she asked, when she had\nsomewhat recovered herself.  She was conscious that she made the remark\nwith an entire lack of conviction.\n\nVasco shook his head.\n\n“But you should have,” said Lulu angrily; “if, as you say, they are\nhighly compromising—”\n\n“Oh, they are, I assure you of that,” interposed the young man.\n\n“Then you should put them out of harm’s way at once.  Supposing anything\nshould leak out, think of all these poor, unfortunate people who would be\ninvolved in the disclosures,” and Lulu tapped the list with an agitated\ngesture.\n\n“Unfortunate, perhaps, but not poor,” corrected Vasco; “if you read the\nlist carefully you’ll notice that I haven’t troubled to include anyone\nwhose financial standing isn’t above question.”\n\nLulu glared at her nephew for some moments in silence.  Then she asked\nhoarsely: “What are you going to do?”\n\n“Nothing—for the remainder of my life,” he answered meaningly.  “A little\nhunting, perhaps,” he continued, “and I shall have a villa at Florence.\nThe Villa Sub-Rosa would sound rather quaint and picturesque, don’t you\nthink, and quite a lot of people would be able to attach a meaning to the\nname.  And I suppose I must have a hobby; I shall probably collect\nRaeburns.”\n\nLulu’s relative, who lived at the Court of Monaco, got quite a snappish\nanswer when she wrote recommending some further invention in the realm of\nmarine research.\n\n\n\n\nTHE COBWEB\n\n\nThe farmhouse kitchen probably stood where it did as a matter of accident\nor haphazard choice; yet its situation might have been planned by a\nmaster-strategist in farmhouse architecture.  Dairy and poultry-yard, and\nherb garden, and all the busy places of the farm seemed to lead by easy\naccess into its wide flagged haven, where there was room for everything\nand where muddy boots left traces that were easily swept away.  And yet,\nfor all that it stood so well in the centre of human bustle, its long,\nlatticed window, with the wide window-seat, built into an embrasure\nbeyond the huge fireplace, looked out on a wild spreading view of hill\nand heather and wooded combe.  The window nook made almost a little room\nin itself, quite the pleasantest room in the farm as far as situation and\ncapabilities went.  Young Mrs. Ladbruk, whose husband had just come into\nthe farm by way of inheritance, cast covetous eyes on this snug corner,\nand her fingers itched to make it bright and cosy with chintz curtains\nand bowls of flowers, and a shelf or two of old china.  The musty farm\nparlour, looking out on to a prim, cheerless garden imprisoned within\nhigh, blank walls, was not a room that lent itself readily either to\ncomfort or decoration.\n\n“When we are more settled I shall work wonders in the way of making the\nkitchen habitable,” said the young woman to her occasional visitors.\nThere was an unspoken wish in those words, a wish which was unconfessed\nas well as unspoken.  Emma Ladbruk was the mistress of the farm; jointly\nwith her husband she might have her say, and to a certain extent her way,\nin ordering its affairs.  But she was not mistress of the kitchen.\n\nOn one of the shelves of an old dresser, in company with chipped\nsauce-boats, pewter jugs, cheese-graters, and paid bills, rested a worn\nand ragged Bible, on whose front page was the record, in faded ink, of a\nbaptism dated ninety-four years ago.  “Martha Crale” was the name written\non that yellow page.  The yellow, wrinkled old dame who hobbled and\nmuttered about the kitchen, looking like a dead autumn leaf which the\nwinter winds still pushed hither and thither, had once been Martha Crale;\nfor seventy odd years she had been Martha Mountjoy.  For longer than\nanyone could remember she had pattered to and fro between oven and\nwash-house and dairy, and out to chicken-run and garden, grumbling and\nmuttering and scolding, but working unceasingly.  Emma Ladbruk, of whose\ncoming she took as little notice as she would of a bee wandering in at a\nwindow on a summer’s day, used at first to watch her with a kind of\nfrightened curiosity.  She was so old and so much a part of the place, it\nwas difficult to think of her exactly as a living thing.  Old Shep, the\nwhite-nozzled, stiff-limbed collie, waiting for his time to die, seemed\nalmost more human than the withered, dried-up old woman.  He had been a\nriotous, roystering puppy, mad with the joy of life, when she was already\na tottering, hobbling dame; now he was just a blind, breathing carcase,\nnothing more, and she still worked with frail energy, still swept and\nbaked and washed, fetched and carried.  If there were something in these\nwise old dogs that did not perish utterly with death, Emma used to think\nto herself, what generations of ghost-dogs there must be out on those\nhills, that Martha had reared and fed and tended and spoken a last\ngood-bye word to in that old kitchen.  And what memories she must have of\nhuman generations that had passed away in her time.  It was difficult for\nanyone, let alone a stranger like Emma, to get her to talk of the days\nthat had been; her shrill, quavering speech was of doors that had been\nleft unfastened, pails that had got mislaid, calves whose feeding-time\nwas overdue, and the various little faults and lapses that chequer a\nfarmhouse routine.  Now and again, when election time came round, she\nwould unstore her recollections of the old names round which the fight\nhad waged in the days gone by.  There had been a Palmerston, that had\nbeen a name down Tiverton way; Tiverton was not a far journey as the crow\nflies, but to Martha it was almost a foreign country.  Later there had\nbeen Northcotes and Aclands, and many other newer names that she had\nforgotten; the names changed, but it was always Libruls and Toories,\nYellows and Blues.  And they always quarrelled and shouted as to who was\nright and who was wrong.  The one they quarrelled about most was a fine\nold gentleman with an angry face—she had seen his picture on the walls.\nShe had seen it on the floor too, with a rotten apple squashed over it,\nfor the farm had changed its politics from time to time.  Martha had\nnever been on one side or the other; none of “they” had ever done the\nfarm a stroke of good.  Such was her sweeping verdict, given with all a\npeasant’s distrust of the outside world.\n\nWhen the half-frightened curiosity had somewhat faded away, Emma Ladbruk\nwas uncomfortably conscious of another feeling towards the old woman.\nShe was a quaint old tradition, lingering about the place, she was part\nand parcel of the farm itself, she was something at once pathetic and\npicturesque—but she was dreadfully in the way.  Emma had come to the farm\nfull of plans for little reforms and improvements, in part the result of\ntraining in the newest ways and methods, in part the outcome of her own\nideas and fancies.  Reforms in the kitchen region, if those deaf old ears\ncould have been induced to give them even a hearing, would have met with\nshort shrift and scornful rejection, and the kitchen region spread over\nthe zone of dairy and market business and half the work of the household.\nEmma, with the latest science of dead-poultry dressing at her\nfinger-tips, sat by, an unheeded watcher, while old Martha trussed the\nchickens for the market-stall as she had trussed them for nearly\nfourscore years—all leg and no breast.  And the hundred hints anent\neffective cleaning and labour-lightening and the things that make for\nwholesomeness which the young woman was ready to impart or to put into\naction dropped away into nothingness before that wan, muttering,\nunheeding presence.  Above all, the coveted window corner, that was to be\na dainty, cheerful oasis in the gaunt old kitchen, stood now choked and\nlumbered with a litter of odds and ends that Emma, for all her nominal\nauthority, would not have dared or cared to displace; over them seemed to\nbe spun the protection of something that was like a human cobweb.\nDecidedly Martha was in the way.  It would have been an unworthy meanness\nto have wished to see the span of that brave old life shortened by a few\npaltry months, but as the days sped by Emma was conscious that the wish\nwas there, disowned though it might be, lurking at the back of her mind.\n\nShe felt the meanness of the wish come over her with a qualm of\nself-reproach one day when she came into the kitchen and found an\nunaccustomed state of things in that usually busy quarter.  Old Martha\nwas not working.  A basket of corn was on the floor by her side, and out\nin the yard the poultry were beginning to clamour a protest of overdue\nfeeding-time.  But Martha sat huddled in a shrunken bunch on the window\nseat, looking out with her dim old eyes as though she saw something\nstranger than the autumn landscape.\n\n“Is anything the matter, Martha?” asked the young woman.\n\n“’Tis death, ’tis death a-coming,” answered the quavering voice; “I knew\n’twere coming.  I knew it.  ’Tweren’t for nothing that old Shep’s been\nhowling all morning.  An’ last night I heard the screech-owl give the\ndeath-cry, and there were something white as run across the yard\nyesterday; ’tweren’t a cat nor a stoat, ’twere something.  The fowls knew\n’twere something; they all drew off to one side.  Ay, there’s been\nwarnings.  I knew it were a-coming.”\n\nThe young woman’s eyes clouded with pity.  The old thing sitting there so\nwhite and shrunken had once been a merry, noisy child, playing about in\nlanes and hay-lofts and farmhouse garrets; that had been eighty odd years\nago, and now she was just a frail old body cowering under the approaching\nchill of the death that was coming at last to take her.  It was not\nprobable that much could be done for her, but Emma hastened away to get\nassistance and counsel.  Her husband, she knew, was down at a\ntree-felling some little distance off, but she might find some other\nintelligent soul who knew the old woman better than she did.  The farm,\nshe soon found out, had that faculty common to farmyards of swallowing up\nand losing its human population.  The poultry followed her in interested\nfashion, and swine grunted interrogations at her from behind the bars of\ntheir styes, but barnyard and rickyard, orchard and stables and dairy,\ngave no reward to her search.  Then, as she retraced her steps towards\nthe kitchen, she came suddenly on her cousin, young Mr. Jim, as every one\ncalled him, who divided his time between amateur horse-dealing,\nrabbit-shooting, and flirting with the farm maids.\n\n“I’m afraid old Martha is dying,” said Emma.  Jim was not the sort of\nperson to whom one had to break news gently.\n\n“Nonsense,” he said; “Martha means to live to a hundred.  She told me so,\nand she’ll do it.”\n\n“She may be actually dying at this moment, or it may just be the\nbeginning of the break-up,” persisted Emma, with a feeling of contempt\nfor the slowness and dulness of the young man.\n\nA grin spread over his good-natured features.\n\n“It don’t look like it,” he said, nodding towards the yard.  Emma turned\nto catch the meaning of his remark.  Old Martha stood in the middle of a\nmob of poultry scattering handfuls of grain around her.  The turkey-cock,\nwith the bronzed sheen of his feathers and the purple-red of his wattles,\nthe gamecock, with the glowing metallic lustre of his Eastern plumage,\nthe hens, with their ochres and buffs and umbers and their scarlet combs,\nand the drakes, with their bottle-green heads, made a medley of rich\ncolour, in the centre of which the old woman looked like a withered stalk\nstanding amid a riotous growth of gaily-hued flowers.  But she threw the\ngrain deftly amid the wilderness of beaks, and her quavering voice\ncarried as far as the two people who were watching her.  She was still\nharping on the theme of death coming to the farm.\n\n“I knew ’twere a-coming.  There’s been signs an’ warnings.”\n\n“Who’s dead, then, old Mother?” called out the young man.\n\n“’Tis young Mister Ladbruk,” she shrilled back; “they’ve just a-carried\nhis body in.  Run out of the way of a tree that was coming down an’ ran\nhisself on to an iron post.  Dead when they picked un up.  Aye, I knew\n’twere coming.”\n\nAnd she turned to fling a handful of barley at a belated group of\nguinea-fowl that came racing toward her.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nThe farm was a family property, and passed to the rabbit-shooting cousin\nas the next-of-kin.  Emma Ladbruk drifted out of its history as a bee\nthat had wandered in at an open window might flit its way out again.  On\na cold grey morning she stood waiting, with her boxes already stowed in\nthe farm cart, till the last of the market produce should be ready, for\nthe train she was to catch was of less importance than the chickens and\nbutter and eggs that were to be offered for sale.  From where she stood\nshe could see an angle of the long latticed window that was to have been\ncosy with curtains and gay with bowls of flowers.  Into her mind came the\nthought that for months, perhaps for years, long after she had been\nutterly forgotten, a white, unheeding face would be seen peering out\nthrough those latticed panes, and a weak muttering voice would be heard\nquavering up and down those flagged passages.  She made her way to a\nnarrow barred casement that opened into the farm larder.  Old Martha was\nstanding at a table trussing a pair of chickens for the market stall as\nshe had trussed them for nearly fourscore years.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LULL\n\n\n“I’ve asked Latimer Springfield to spend Sunday with us and stop the\nnight,” announced Mrs. Durmot at the breakfast-table.\n\n“I thought he was in the throes of an election,” remarked her husband.\n\n“Exactly; the poll is on Wednesday, and the poor man will have worked\nhimself to a shadow by that time.  Imagine what electioneering must be\nlike in this awful soaking rain, going along slushy country roads and\nspeaking to damp audiences in draughty schoolrooms, day after day for a\nfortnight.  He’ll have to put in an appearance at some place of worship\non Sunday morning, and he can come to us immediately afterwards and have\na thorough respite from everything connected with politics.  I won’t let\nhim even think of them.  I’ve had the picture of Cromwell dissolving the\nLong Parliament taken down from the staircase, and even the portrait of\nLord Rosebery’s ‘Ladas’ removed from the smoking-room.  And Vera,” added\nMrs. Durmot, turning to her sixteen-year-old niece, “be careful what\ncolour ribbon you wear in your hair; not blue or yellow on any account;\nthose are the rival party colours, and emerald green or orange would be\nalmost as bad, with this Home Rule business to the fore.”\n\n“On state occasions I always wear a black ribbon in my hair,” said Vera\nwith crushing dignity.\n\nLatimer Springfield was a rather cheerless, oldish young man, who went\ninto politics somewhat in the spirit in which other people might go into\nhalf-mourning.  Without being an enthusiast, however, he was a fairly\nstrenuous plodder, and Mrs. Durmot had been reasonably near the mark in\nasserting that he was working at high pressure over this election.  The\nrestful lull which his hostess enforced on him was decidedly welcome, and\nyet the nervous excitement of the contest had too great a hold on him to\nbe totally banished.\n\n“I know he’s going to sit up half the night working up points for his\nfinal speeches,” said Mrs. Durmot regretfully; “however, we’ve kept\npolitics at arm’s length all the afternoon and evening.  More than that\nwe cannot do.”\n\n“That remains to be seen,” said Vera, but she said it to herself.\n\nLatimer had scarcely shut his bedroom door before he was immersed in a\nsheaf of notes and pamphlets, while a fountain-pen and pocket-book were\nbrought into play for the due marshalling of useful facts and discreet\nfictions.  He had been at work for perhaps thirty-five minutes, and the\nhouse was seemingly consecrated to the healthy slumber of country life,\nwhen a stifled squealing and scuffling in the passage was followed by a\nloud tap at his door.  Before he had time to answer, a much-encumbered\nVera burst into the room with the question; “I say, can I leave these\nhere?”\n\n“These” were a small black pig and a lusty specimen of black-red\ngamecock.\n\nLatimer was moderately fond of animals, and particularly interested in\nsmall livestock rearing from the economic point of view; in fact, one of\nthe pamphlets on which he was at that moment engaged warmly advocated the\nfurther development of the pig and poultry industry in our rural\ndistricts; but he was pardonably unwilling to share even a commodious\nbedroom with samples of henroost and stye products.\n\n“Wouldn’t they be happier somewhere outside?” he asked, tactfully\nexpressing his own preference in the matter in an apparent solicitude for\ntheirs.\n\n“There is no outside,” said Vera impressively, “nothing but a waste of\ndark, swirling waters.  The reservoir at Brinkley has burst.”\n\n“I didn’t know there was a reservoir at Brinkley,” said Latimer.\n\n“Well, there isn’t now, it’s jolly well all over the place, and as we\nstand particularly low we’re the centre of an inland sea just at present.\nYou see the river has overflowed its banks as well.”\n\n“Good gracious!  Have any lives been lost?”\n\n“Heaps, I should say.  The second housemaid has already identified three\nbodies that have floated past the billiard-room window as being the young\nman she’s engaged to.  Either she’s engaged to a large assortment of the\npopulation round here or else she’s very careless at identification.  Of\ncourse it may be the same body coming round again and again in a swirl; I\nhadn’t thought of that.”\n\n“But we ought to go out and do rescue work, oughtn’t we?” said Latimer,\nwith the instinct of a Parliamentary candidate for getting into the local\nlimelight.\n\n“We can’t,” said Vera decidedly, “we haven’t any boats and we’re cut off\nby a raging torrent from any human habitation.  My aunt particularly\nhoped you would keep to your room and not add to the confusion, but she\nthought it would be so kind of you if you would take in Hartlepool’s\nWonder, the gamecock, you know, for the night.  You see, there are eight\nother gamecocks, and they fight like furies if they get together, so\nwe’re putting one in each bedroom.  The fowl-houses are all flooded out,\nyou know.  And then I thought perhaps you wouldn’t mind taking in this\nwee piggie; he’s rather a little love, but he has a vile temper.  He gets\nthat from his mother—not that I like to say things against her when she’s\nlying dead and drowned in her stye, poor thing.  What he really wants is\na man’s firm hand to keep him in order.  I’d try and grapple with him\nmyself, only I’ve got my chow in my room, you know, and he goes for pigs\nwherever he finds them.”\n\n“Couldn’t the pig go in the bathroom?” asked Latimer faintly, wishing\nthat he had taken up as determined a stand on the subject of bedroom\nswine as the chow had.\n\n“The bathroom?” Vera laughed shrilly.  “It’ll be full of Boy Scouts till\nmorning if the hot water holds out.”\n\n“Boy Scouts?”\n\n“Yes, thirty of them came to rescue us while the water was only\nwaist-high; then it rose another three feet or so and we had to rescue\nthem.  We’re giving them hot baths in batches and drying their clothes in\nthe hot-air cupboard, but, of course, drenched clothes don’t dry in a\nminute, and the corridor and staircase are beginning to look like a bit\nof coast scenery by Tuke.  Two of the boys are wearing your Melton\novercoat; I hope you don’t mind.”\n\n“It’s a new overcoat,” said Latimer, with every indication of minding\ndreadfully.\n\n“You’ll take every care of Hartlepool’s Wonder, won’t you?” said Vera.\n“His mother took three firsts at Birmingham, and he was second in the\ncockerel class last year at Gloucester.  He’ll probably roost on the rail\nat the bottom of your bed.  I wonder if he’d feel more at home if some of\nhis wives were up here with him?  The hens are all in the pantry, and I\nthink I could pick out Hartlepool Helen; she’s his favourite.”\n\nLatimer showed a belated firmness on the subject of Hartlepool Helen, and\nVera withdrew without pressing the point, having first settled the\ngamecock on his extemporised perch and taken an affectionate farewell of\nthe pigling.  Latimer undressed and got into bed with all due speed,\njudging that the pig would abate its inquisitorial restlessness once the\nlight was turned out.  As a substitute for a cosy, straw-bedded sty the\nroom offered, at first inspection, few attractions, but the disconsolate\nanimal suddenly discovered an appliance in which the most luxuriously\ncontrived piggeries were notably deficient.  The sharp edge of the\nunderneath part of the bed was pitched at exactly the right elevation to\npermit the pigling to scrape himself ecstatically backwards and forwards,\nwith an artistic humping of the back at the crucial moment and an\naccompanying gurgle of long-drawn delight.  The gamecock, who may have\nfancied that he was being rocked in the branches of a pine-tree, bore the\nmotion with greater fortitude than Latimer was able to command.  A series\nof slaps directed at the pig’s body were accepted more as an additional\nand pleasing irritant than as a criticism of conduct or a hint to desist;\nevidently something more than a man’s firm hand was needed to deal with\nthe case.  Latimer slipped out of bed in search of a weapon of\ndissuasion.  There was sufficient light in the room to enable the pig to\ndetect this manœuvre, and the vile temper, inherited from the drowned\nmother, found full play.  Latimer bounded back into bed, and his\nconqueror, after a few threatening snorts and champings of its jaws,\nresumed its massage operations with renewed zeal.  During the long\nwakeful hours which ensued Latimer tried to distract his mind from his\nown immediate troubles by dwelling with decent sympathy on the second\nhousemaid’s bereavement, but he found himself more often wondering how\nmany Boy Scouts were sharing his Melton overcoat.  The rôle of Saint\nMartin malgré lui was not one which appealed to him.\n\nTowards dawn the pigling fell into a happy slumber, and Latimer might\nhave followed its example, but at about the same time Stupor Hartlepooli\ngave a rousing crow, clattered down to the floor and forthwith commenced\na spirited combat with his reflection in the wardrobe mirror.\nRemembering that the bird was more or less under his care Latimer\nperformed Hague Tribunal offices by draping a bath-towel over the\nprovocative mirror, but the ensuing peace was local and short-lived.  The\ndeflected energies of the gamecock found new outlet in a sudden and\nsustained attack on the sleeping and temporarily inoffensive pigling, and\nthe duel which followed was desperate and embittered beyond any\npossibility of effective intervention.  The feathered combatant had the\nadvantage of being able, when hard pressed, to take refuge on the bed,\nand freely availed himself of this circumstance; the pigling never quite\nsucceeded in hurling himself on to the same eminence, but it was not from\nwant of trying.\n\nNeither side could claim any decisive success, and the struggle had been\npractically fought to a standstill by the time that the maid appeared\nwith the early morning tea.\n\n“Lor, sir,” she exclaimed in undisguised astonishment, “do you want those\nanimals in your room?”\n\n_Want_!\n\nThe pigling, as though aware that it might have outstayed its welcome,\ndashed out at the door, and the gamecock followed it at a more dignified\npace.\n\n“If Miss Vera’s dog sees that pig—!” exclaimed the maid, and hurried off\nto avert such a catastrophe.\n\nA cold suspicion was stealing over Latimer’s mind; he went to the window\nand drew up the blind.  A light, drizzling rain was falling, but there\nwas not the faintest trace of any inundation.\n\nSome half-hour later he met Vera on the way to the breakfast-room.\n\n“I should not like to think of you as a deliberate liar,” he observed\ncoldly, “but one occasionally has to do things one does not like.”\n\n“At any rate I kept your mind from dwelling on politics all the night,”\nsaid Vera.\n\nWhich was, of course, perfectly true.\n\n\n\n\nTHE UNKINDEST BLOW\n\n\nThe season of strikes seemed to have run itself to a standstill.  Almost\nevery trade and industry and calling in which a dislocation could\npossibly be engineered had indulged in that luxury.  The last and least\nsuccessful convulsion had been the strike of the World’s Union of\nZoological Garden attendants, who, pending the settlement of certain\ndemands, refused to minister further to the wants of the animals\ncommitted to their charge or to allow any other keepers to take their\nplace.  In this case the threat of the Zoological Gardens authorities\nthat if the men “came out” the animals should come out also had\nintensified and precipitated the crisis.  The imminent prospect of the\nlarger carnivores, to say nothing of rhinoceroses and bull bison, roaming\nat large and unfed in the heart of London, was not one which permitted of\nprolonged conferences.  The Government of the day, which from its\ntendency to be a few hours behind the course of events had been nicknamed\nthe Government of the afternoon, was obliged to intervene with\npromptitude and decision.  A strong force of Bluejackets was despatched\nto Regent’s Park to take over the temporarily abandoned duties of the\nstrikers.  Bluejackets were chosen in preference to land forces, partly\non account of the traditional readiness of the British Navy to go\nanywhere and do anything, partly by reason of the familiarity of the\naverage sailor with monkeys, parrots, and other tropical fauna, but\nchiefly at the urgent request of the First Lord of the Admiralty, who was\nkeenly desirous of an opportunity for performing some personal act of\nunobtrusive public service within the province of his department.\n\n“If he insists on feeding the infant jaguar himself, in defiance of its\nmother’s wishes, there may be another by-election in the north,” said one\nof his colleagues, with a hopeful inflection in his voice.  “By-elections\nare not very desirable at present, but we must not be selfish.”\n\nAs a matter of fact the strike collapsed peacefully without any outside\nintervention.  The majority of the keepers had become so attached to\ntheir charges that they returned to work of their own accord.\n\nAnd then the nation and the newspapers turned with a sense of relief to\nhappier things.  It seemed as if a new era of contentment was about to\ndawn.  Everybody had struck who could possibly want to strike or who\ncould possibly be cajoled or bullied into striking, whether they wanted\nto or not.  The lighter and brighter side of life might now claim some\nattention.  And conspicuous among the other topics that sprang into\nsudden prominence was the pending Falvertoon divorce suit.\n\nThe Duke of Falvertoon was one of those human _hors d’œuvres_ that\nstimulate the public appetite for sensation without giving it much to\nfeed on.  As a mere child he had been precociously brilliant; he had\ndeclined the editorship of the _Anglian Review_ at an age when most boys\nare content to have declined _mensa_, a table, and though he could not\nclaim to have originated the Futurist movement in literature, his\n“Letters to a possible Grandson,” written at the age of fourteen, had\nattracted considerable notice.  In later days his brilliancy had been\nless conspicuously displayed.  During a debate in the House of Lords on\naffairs in Morocco, at a moment when that country, for the fifth time in\nseven years, had brought half Europe to the verge of war, he had\ninterpolated the remark “a little Moor and how much it is,” but in spite\nof the encouraging reception accorded to this one political utterance he\nwas never tempted to a further display in that direction.  It began to be\ngenerally understood that he did not intend to supplement his numerous\ntown and country residences by living overmuch in the public eye.\n\nAnd then had come the unlooked-for tidings of the imminent proceedings\nfor divorce.  And such a divorce!  There were cross-suits and allegations\nand counter-allegations, charges of cruelty and desertion, everything in\nfact that was necessary to make the case one of the most complicated and\nsensational of its kind.  And the number of distinguished people involved\nor cited as witnesses not only embraced both political parties in the\nrealm and several Colonial governors, but included an exotic contingent\nfrom France, Hungary, the United States of North America, and the Grand\nDuchy of Baden.  Hotel accommodation of the more expensive sort began to\nexperience a strain on its resources.  “It will be quite like the Durbar\nwithout the elephants,” exclaimed an enthusiastic lady who, to do her\njustice, had never seen a Durbar.  The general feeling was one of\nthankfulness that the last of the strikes had been got over before the\ndate fixed for the hearing of the great suit.\n\nAs a reaction from the season of gloom and industrial strife that had\njust passed away the agencies that purvey and stage-manage sensations\nlaid themselves out to do their level best on this momentous occasion.\nMen who had made their reputations as special descriptive writers were\nmobilised from distant corners of Europe and the further side of the\nAtlantic in order to enrich with their pens the daily printed records of\nthe case; one word-painter, who specialised in descriptions of how\nwitnesses turn pale under cross-examination, was summoned hurriedly back\nfrom a famous and prolonged murder trial in Sicily, where indeed his\ntalents were being decidedly wasted.  Thumb-nail artists and expert kodak\nmanipulators were retained at extravagant salaries, and special dress\nreporters were in high demand.  An enterprising Paris firm of costume\nbuilders presented the defendant Duchess with three special creations, to\nbe worn, marked, learned, and extensively reported at various critical\nstages of the trial; and as for the cinematograph agents, their industry\nand persistence was untiring.  Films representing the Duke saying\ngood-bye to his favourite canary on the eve of the trial were in\nreadiness weeks before the event was due to take place; other films\ndepicted the Duchess holding imaginary consultations with fictitious\nlawyers or making a light repast off specially advertised vegetarian\nsandwiches during a supposed luncheon interval.  As far as human\nforesight and human enterprise could go nothing was lacking to make the\ntrial a success.\n\nTwo days before the case was down for hearing the advance reporter of an\nimportant syndicate obtained an interview with the Duke for the purpose\nof gleaning some final grains of information concerning his Grace’s\npersonal arrangements during the trial.\n\n“I suppose I may say this will be one of the biggest affairs of its kind\nduring the lifetime of a generation,” began the reporter as an excuse for\nthe unsparing minuteness of detail that he was about to make quest for.\n\n“I suppose so—if it comes off,” said the Duke lazily.\n\n“If?” queried the reporter, in a voice that was something between a gasp\nand a scream.\n\n“The Duchess and I are both thinking of going on strike,” said the Duke.\n\n“Strike!”\n\nThe baleful word flashed out in all its old hideous familiarity.  Was\nthere to be no end to its recurrence?\n\n“Do you mean,” faltered the reporter, “that you are contemplating a\nmutual withdrawal of the charges?”\n\n“Precisely,” said the Duke.\n\n“But think of the arrangements that have been made, the special\nreporting, the cinematographs, the catering for the distinguished foreign\nwitnesses, the prepared music-hall allusions; think of all the money that\nhas been sunk—”\n\n“Exactly,” said the Duke coldly, “the Duchess and I have realised that it\nis we who provide the material out of which this great far-reaching\nindustry has been built up.  Widespread employment will be given and\nenormous profits made during the duration of the case, and we, on whom\nall the stress and racket falls, will get—what?  An unenviable notoriety\nand the privilege of paying heavy legal expenses whichever way the\nverdict goes.  Hence our decision to strike.  We don’t wish to be\nreconciled; we fully realise that it is a grave step to take, but unless\nwe get some reasonable consideration out of this vast stream of wealth\nand industry that we have called into being we intend coming out of court\nand staying out.  Good afternoon.”\n\nThe news of this latest strike spread universal dismay.  Its\ninaccessibility to the ordinary methods of persuasion made it peculiarly\nformidable.  If the Duke and Duchess persisted in being reconciled the\nGovernment could hardly be called on to interfere.  Public opinion in the\nshape of social ostracism might be brought to bear on them, but that was\nas far as coercive measures could go.  There was nothing for it but a\nconference, with powers to propose liberal terms.  As it was, several of\nthe foreign witnesses had already departed and others had telegraphed\ncancelling their hotel arrangements.\n\nThe conference, protracted, uncomfortable, and occasionally acrimonious,\nsucceeded at last in arranging for a resumption of litigation, but it was\na fruitless victory.  The Duke, with a touch of his earlier precocity,\ndied of premature decay a fortnight before the date fixed for the new\ntrial.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ROMANCERS\n\n\nIt was autumn in London, that blessed season between the harshness of\nwinter and the insincerities of summer; a trustful season when one buys\nbulbs and sees to the registration of one’s vote, believing perpetually\nin spring and a change of Government.\n\nMorton Crosby sat on a bench in a secluded corner of Hyde Park, lazily\nenjoying a cigarette and watching the slow grazing promenade of a pair of\nsnow-geese, the male looking rather like an albino edition of the\nrusset-hued female.  Out of the corner of his eye Crosby also noted with\nsome interest the hesitating hoverings of a human figure, which had\npassed and repassed his seat two or three times at shortening intervals,\nlike a wary crow about to alight near some possibly edible morsel.\nInevitably the figure came to an anchorage on the bench, within easy\ntalking distance of its original occupant.  The uncared-for clothes, the\naggressive, grizzled beard, and the furtive, evasive eye of the new-comer\nbespoke the professional cadger, the man who would undergo hours of\nhumiliating tale-spinning and rebuff rather than adventure on half a\nday’s decent work.\n\nFor a while the new-comer fixed his eyes straight in front of him in a\nstrenuous, unseeing gaze; then his voice broke out with the insinuating\ninflection of one who has a story to retail well worth any loiterer’s\nwhile to listen to.\n\n“It’s a strange world,” he said.\n\nAs the statement met with no response he altered it to the form of a\nquestion.\n\n“I daresay you’ve found it to be a strange world, mister?”\n\n“As far as I am concerned,” said Crosby, “the strangeness has worn off in\nthe course of thirty-six years.”\n\n“Ah,” said the greybeard, “I could tell you things that you’d hardly\nbelieve.  Marvellous things that have really happened to me.”\n\n“Nowadays there is no demand for marvellous things that have really\nhappened,” said Crosby discouragingly; “the professional writers of\nfiction turn these things out so much better.  For instance, my\nneighbours tell me wonderful, incredible things that their Aberdeens and\nchows and borzois have done; I never listen to them.  On the other hand,\nI have read ‘The Hound of the Baskervilles’ three times.”\n\nThe greybeard moved uneasily in his seat; then he opened up new country.\n\n“I take it that you are a professing Christian,” he observed.\n\n“I am a prominent and I think I may say an influential member of the\nMussulman community of Eastern Persia,” said Crosby, making an excursion\nhimself into the realms of fiction.\n\nThe greybeard was obviously disconcerted at this new check to\nintroductory conversation, but the defeat was only momentary.\n\n“Persia.  I should never have taken you for a Persian,” he remarked, with\na somewhat aggrieved air.\n\n“I am not,” said Crosby; “my father was an Afghan.”\n\n“An Afghan!” said the other, smitten into bewildered silence for a\nmoment.  Then he recovered himself and renewed his attack.\n\n“Afghanistan.  Ah!  We’ve had some wars with that country; now, I\ndaresay, instead of fighting it we might have learned something from it.\nA very wealthy country, I believe.  No real poverty there.”\n\nHe raised his voice on the word “poverty” with a suggestion of intense\nfeeling.  Crosby saw the opening and avoided it.\n\n“It possesses, nevertheless, a number of highly talented and ingenious\nbeggars,” he said; “if I had not spoken so disparagingly of marvellous\nthings that have really happened I would tell you the story of Ibrahim\nand the eleven camel-loads of blotting-paper.  Also I have forgotten\nexactly how it ended.”\n\n“My own life-story is a curious one,” said the stranger, apparently\nstifling all desire to hear the history of Ibrahim; “I was not always as\nyou see me now.”\n\n“We are supposed to undergo complete change in the course of every seven\nyears,” said Crosby, as an explanation of the foregoing announcement.\n\n“I mean I was not always in such distressing circumstances as I am at\npresent,” pursued the stranger doggedly.\n\n“That sounds rather rude,” said Crosby stiffly, “considering that you are\nat present talking to a man reputed to be one of the most gifted\nconversationalists of the Afghan border.”\n\n“I don’t mean in that way,” said the greybeard hastily; “I’ve been very\nmuch interested in your conversation.  I was alluding to my unfortunate\nfinancial situation.  You mayn’t hardly believe it, but at the present\nmoment I am absolutely without a farthing.  Don’t see any prospect of\ngetting any money, either, for the next few days.  I don’t suppose you’ve\never found yourself in such a position,” he added.\n\n“In the town of Yom,” said Crosby, “which is in Southern Afghanistan, and\nwhich also happens to be my birthplace, there was a Chinese philosopher\nwho used to say that one of the three chiefest human blessings was to be\nabsolutely without money.  I forget what the other two were.”\n\n“Ah, I daresay,” said the stranger, in a tone that betrayed no enthusiasm\nfor the philosopher’s memory; “and did he practise what he preached?\nThat’s the test.”\n\n“He lived happily with very little money or resources,” said Crosby.\n\n“Then I expect he had friends who would help him liberally whenever he\nwas in difficulties, such as I am in at present.”\n\n“In Yom,” said Crosby, “it is not necessary to have friends in order to\nobtain help.  Any citizen of Yom would help a stranger as a matter of\ncourse.”\n\nThe greybeard was now genuinely interested.\n\nThe conversation had at last taken a favourable turn.\n\n“If someone, like me, for instance, who was in undeserved difficulties,\nasked a citizen of that town you speak of for a small loan to tide over a\nfew days’ impecuniosity—five shillings, or perhaps a rather larger\nsum—would it be given to him as a matter of course?”\n\n“There would be a certain preliminary,” said Crosby; “one would take him\nto a wine-shop and treat him to a measure of wine, and then, after a\nlittle high-flown conversation, one would put the desired sum in his hand\nand wish him good-day.  It is a roundabout way of performing a simple\ntransaction, but in the East all ways are roundabout.”\n\nThe listener’s eyes were glittering.\n\n“Ah,” he exclaimed, with a thin sneer ringing meaningly through his\nwords, “I suppose you’ve given up all those generous customs since you\nleft your town.  Don’t practise them now, I expect.”\n\n“No one who has lived in Yom,” said Crosby fervently, “and remembers its\ngreen hills covered with apricot and almond trees, and the cold water\nthat rushes down like a caress from the upland snows and dashes under the\nlittle wooden bridges, no one who remembers these things and treasures\nthe memory of them would ever give up a single one of its unwritten laws\nand customs.  To me they are as binding as though I still lived in that\nhallowed home of my youth.”\n\n“Then if I was to ask you for a small loan—” began the greybeard\nfawningly, edging nearer on the seat and hurriedly wondering how large he\nmight safely make his request, “if I was to ask you for, say—”\n\n“At any other time, certainly,” said Crosby; “in the months of November\nand December, however, it is absolutely forbidden for anyone of our race\nto give or receive loans or gifts; in fact, one does not willingly speak\nof them.  It is considered unlucky.  We will therefore close this\ndiscussion.”\n\n“But it is still October!” exclaimed the adventurer with an eager, angry\nwhine, as Crosby rose from his seat; “wants eight days to the end of the\nmonth!”\n\n“The Afghan November began yesterday,” said Crosby severely, and in\nanother moment he was striding across the Park, leaving his recent\ncompanion scowling and muttering furiously on the seat.\n\n“I don’t believe a word of his story,” he chattered to himself; “pack of\nnasty lies from beginning to end.  Wish I’d told him so to his face.\nCalling himself an Afghan!”\n\nThe snorts and snarls that escaped from him for the next quarter of an\nhour went far to support the truth of the old saying that two of a trade\nnever agree.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SCHARTZ-METTERKLUME METHOD\n\n\nLady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station\nand took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length, to kill time\ntill the train should be pleased to proceed on its way.  Then, in the\nroadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load,\nand a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the\nanimal that helps him to earn a living.  Lady Carlotta promptly betook\nher to the roadway, and put rather a different complexion on the\nstruggle.  Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful\nadmonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a\ndistressed animal, such interference being “none of her business.”  Only\nonce had she put the doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one\nof its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours\nin a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig,\nwhile Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had proceeded with\nthe water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere\nbetween the boar and his prisoner.  It is to be feared that she lost the\nfriendship of the ultimately rescued lady.  On this occasion she merely\nlost the train, which gave way to the first sign of impatience it had\nshown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her.  She bore the\ndesertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were\nthoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her.\nShe wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that\nshe was coming on “by another train.”  Before she had time to think what\nher next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady,\nwho seemed to be taking a prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and\nlooks.\n\n“You must be Miss Hope, the governess I’ve come to meet,” said the\napparition, in a tone that admitted of very little argument.\n\n“Very well, if I must I must,” said Lady Carlotta to herself with\ndangerous meekness.\n\n“I am Mrs. Quabarl,” continued the lady; “and where, pray, is your\nluggage?”\n\n“It’s gone astray,” said the alleged governess, falling in with the\nexcellent rule of life that the absent are always to blame; the luggage\nhad, in point of fact, behaved with perfect correctitude.  “I’ve just\ntelegraphed about it,” she added, with a nearer approach to truth.\n\n“How provoking,” said Mrs. Quabarl; “these railway companies are so\ncareless.  However, my maid can lend you things for the night,” and she\nled the way to her car.\n\nDuring the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively\nintroduced to the nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she\nlearned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people,\nthat Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola\nwas something or other else of a mould equally commonplace among children\nof that class and type in the twentieth century.\n\n“I wish them not only to be _taught_,” said Mrs. Quabarl, “but\n_interested_ in what they learn.  In their history lessons, for instance,\nyou must try to make them feel that they are being introduced to the\nlife-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a\nmass of names and dates to memory.  French, of course, I shall expect you\nto talk at meal-times several days in the week.”\n\n“I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining\nthree.”\n\n“Russian?  My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands\nRussian.”\n\n“That will not embarrass me in the least,” said Lady Carlotta coldly.\n\nMrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch.\nShe was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are\nmagnificent and autocratic as long as they are not seriously opposed.\nThe least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering\nthem cowed and apologetic.  When the new governess failed to express\nwondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and\nlightly alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had\njust been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became\nalmost abject.  Her feelings were those which might have animated a\ngeneral of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his heaviest\nbattle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and\njavelin throwers.\n\nAt dinner that evening, although reinforced by her husband, who usually\nduplicated her opinions and lent her moral support generally, Mrs.\nQuabarl regained none of her lost ground.  The governess not only helped\nherself well and truly to wine, but held forth with considerable show of\ncritical knowledge on various vintage matters, concerning which the\nQuabarls were in no wise able to pose as authorities.  Previous\ngovernesses had limited their conversation on the wine topic to a\nrespectful and doubtless sincere expression of a preference for water.\nWhen this one went as far as to recommend a wine firm in whose hands you\ncould not go very far wrong Mrs. Quabarl thought it time to turn the\nconversation into more usual channels.\n\n“We got very satisfactory references about you from Canon Teep,” she\nobserved; “a very estimable man, I should think.”\n\n“Drinks like a fish and beats his wife, otherwise a very lovable\ncharacter,” said the governess imperturbably.\n\n“_My dear_ Miss Hope!  I trust you are exaggerating,” exclaimed the\nQuabarls in unison.\n\n“One must in justice admit that there is some provocation,” continued the\nromancer.  “Mrs. Teep is quite the most irritating bridge-player that I\nhave ever sat down with; her leads and declarations would condone a\ncertain amount of brutality in her partner, but to souse her with the\ncontents of the only soda-water syphon in the house on a Sunday\nafternoon, when one couldn’t get another, argues an indifference to the\ncomfort of others which I cannot altogether overlook.  You may think me\nhasty in my judgments, but it was practically on account of the syphon\nincident that I left.”\n\n“We will talk of this some other time,” said Mrs. Quabarl hastily.\n\n“I shall never allude to it again,” said the governess with decision.\n\nMr. Quabarl made a welcome diversion by asking what studies the new\ninstructress proposed to inaugurate on the morrow.\n\n“History to begin with,” she informed him.\n\n“Ah, history,” he observed sagely; “now in teaching them history you must\ntake care to interest them in what they learn.  You must make them feel\nthat they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who\nreally lived—”\n\n“I’ve told her all that,” interposed Mrs. Quabarl.\n\n“I teach history on the Schartz-Metterklume method,” said the governess\nloftily.\n\n“Ah, yes,” said her listeners, thinking it expedient to assume an\nacquaintance at least with the name.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n“What are you children doing out here?” demanded Mrs. Quabarl the next\nmorning, on finding Irene sitting rather glumly at the head of the\nstairs, while her sister was perched in an attitude of depressed\ndiscomfort on the window-seat behind her, with a wolf-skin rug almost\ncovering her.\n\n“We are having a history lesson,” came the unexpected reply.  “I am\nsupposed to be Rome, and Viola up there is the she-wolf; not a real wolf,\nbut the figure of one that the Romans used to set store by—I forget why.\nClaude and Wilfrid have gone to fetch the shabby women.”\n\n“The shabby women?”\n\n“Yes, they’ve got to carry them off.  They didn’t want to, but Miss Hope\ngot one of father’s fives-bats and said she’d give them a number nine\nspanking if they didn’t, so they’ve gone to do it.”\n\nA loud, angry screaming from the direction of the lawn drew Mrs. Quabarl\nthither in hot haste, fearful lest the threatened castigation might even\nnow be in process of infliction.  The outcry, however, came principally\nfrom the two small daughters of the lodge-keeper, who were being hauled\nand pushed towards the house by the panting and dishevelled Claude and\nWilfrid, whose task was rendered even more arduous by the incessant, if\nnot very effectual, attacks of the captured maidens’ small brother.  The\ngoverness, fives-bat in hand, sat negligently on the stone balustrade,\npresiding over the scene with the cold impartiality of a Goddess of\nBattles.  A furious and repeated chorus of “I’ll tell muvver” rose from\nthe lodge-children, but the lodge-mother, who was hard of hearing, was\nfor the moment immersed in the preoccupation of her washtub.\n\nAfter an apprehensive glance in the direction of the lodge (the good\nwoman was gifted with the highly militant temper which is sometimes the\nprivilege of deafness) Mrs. Quabarl flew indignantly to the rescue of the\nstruggling captives.\n\n“Wilfrid!  Claude!  Let those children go at once.  Miss Hope, what on\nearth is the meaning of this scene?”\n\n“Early Roman history; the Sabine Women, don’t you know?  It’s the\nSchartz-Metterklume method to make children understand history by acting\nit themselves; fixes it in their memory, you know.  Of course, if, thanks\nto your interference, your boys go through life thinking that the Sabine\nwomen ultimately escaped, I really cannot be held responsible.”\n\n“You may be very clever and modern, Miss Hope,” said Mrs. Quabarl firmly,\n“but I should like you to leave here by the next train.  Your luggage\nwill be sent after you as soon as it arrives.”\n\n“I’m not certain exactly where I shall be for the next few days,” said\nthe dismissed instructress of youth; “you might keep my luggage till I\nwire my address.  There are only a couple of trunks and some golf-clubs\nand a leopard cub.”\n\n“A leopard cub!” gasped Mrs. Quabarl.  Even in her departure this\nextraordinary person seemed destined to leave a trail of embarrassment\nbehind her.\n\n“Well, it’s rather left off being a cub; it’s more than half-grown, you\nknow.  A fowl every day and a rabbit on Sundays is what it usually gets.\nRaw beef makes it too excitable.  Don’t trouble about getting the car for\nme, I’m rather inclined for a walk.”\n\nAnd Lady Carlotta strode out of the Quabarl horizon.\n\nThe advent of the genuine Miss Hope, who had made a mistake as to the day\non which she was due to arrive, caused a turmoil which that good lady was\nquite unused to inspiring.  Obviously the Quabarl family had been\nwoefully befooled, but a certain amount of relief came with the\nknowledge.\n\n“How tiresome for you, dear Carlotta,” said her hostess, when the overdue\nguest ultimately arrived; “how very tiresome losing your train and having\nto stop overnight in a strange place.”\n\n“Oh dear, no,” said Lady Carlotta; “not at all tiresome—for me.”\n\n\n\n\nTHE SEVENTH PULLET\n\n\n“It’s not the daily grind that I complain of,” said Blenkinthrope\nresentfully; “it’s the dull grey sameness of my life outside of office\nhours.  Nothing of interest comes my way, nothing remarkable or out of\nthe common.  Even the little things that I do try to find some interest\nin don’t seem to interest other people.  Things in my garden, for\ninstance.”\n\n“The potato that weighed just over two pounds,” said his friend Gorworth.\n\n“Did I tell you about that?” said Blenkinthrope; “I was telling the\nothers in the train this morning.  I forgot if I’d told you.”\n\n“To be exact you told me that it weighed just under two pounds, but I\ntook into account the fact that abnormal vegetables and freshwater fish\nhave an after-life, in which growth is not arrested.”\n\n“You’re just like the others,” said Blenkinthrope sadly, “you only make\nfun of it.”\n\n“The fault is with the potato, not with us,” said Gorworth; “we are not\nin the least interested in it because it is not in the least interesting.\nThe men you go up in the train with every day are just in the same case\nas yourself; their lives are commonplace and not very interesting to\nthemselves, and they certainly are not going to wax enthusiastic over the\ncommonplace events in other men’s lives.  Tell them something startling,\ndramatic, piquant that has happened to yourself or to someone in your\nfamily, and you will capture their interest at once.  They will talk\nabout you with a certain personal pride to all their acquaintances.  ‘Man\nI know intimately, fellow called Blenkinthrope, lives down my way, had\ntwo of his fingers clawed clean off by a lobster he was carrying home to\nsupper.  Doctor says entire hand may have to come off.’  Now that is\nconversation of a very high order.  But imagine walking into a tennis\nclub with the remark: ‘I know a man who has grown a potato weighing two\nand a quarter pounds.’”\n\n“But hang it all, my dear fellow,” said Blenkinthrope impatiently,\n“haven’t I just told you that nothing of a remarkable nature ever happens\nto me?”\n\n“Invent something,” said Gorworth.  Since winning a prize for excellence\nin Scriptural knowledge at a preparatory school he had felt licensed to\nbe a little more unscrupulous than the circle he moved in.  Much might\nsurely be excused to one who in early life could give a list of seventeen\ntrees mentioned in the Old Testament.\n\n“What sort of thing?” asked Blenkinthrope, somewhat snappishly.\n\n“A snake got into your hen-run yesterday morning and killed six out of\nseven pullets, first mesmerising them with its eyes and then biting them\nas they stood helpless.  The seventh pullet was one of that French sort,\nwith feathers all over its eyes, so it escaped the mesmeric snare, and\njust flew at what it could see of the snake and pecked it to pieces.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Blenkinthrope stiffly; “it’s a very clever invention.\nIf such a thing had really happened in my poultry-run I admit I should\nhave been proud and interested to tell people about it.  But I’d rather\nstick to fact, even if it is plain fact.”  All the same his mind dwelt\nwistfully on the story of the Seventh Pullet.  He could picture himself\ntelling it in the train amid the absorbed interest of his\nfellow-passengers.  Unconsciously all sorts of little details and\nimprovements began to suggest themselves.\n\nWistfulness was still his dominant mood when he took his seat in the\nrailway carriage the next morning.  Opposite him sat Stevenham, who had\nattained to a recognised brevet of importance through the fact of an\nuncle having dropped dead in the act of voting at a Parliamentary\nelection.  That had happened three years ago, but Stevenham was still\ndeferred to on all questions of home and foreign politics.\n\n“Hullo, how’s the giant mushroom, or whatever it was?” was all the notice\nBlenkinthrope got from his fellow travellers.\n\nYoung Duckby, whom he mildly disliked, speedily monopolised the general\nattention by an account of a domestic bereavement.\n\n“Had four young pigeons carried off last night by a whacking big rat.\nOh, a monster he must have been; you could tell by the size of the hole\nhe made breaking into the loft.”\n\nNo moderate-sized rat ever seemed to carry out any predatory operations\nin these regions; they were all enormous in their enormity.\n\n“Pretty hard lines that,” continued Duckby, seeing that he had secured\nthe attention and respect of the company; “four squeakers carried off at\none swoop.  You’d find it rather hard to match that in the way of\nunlooked-for bad luck.”\n\n“I had six pullets out of a pen of seven killed by a snake yesterday\nafternoon,” said Blenkinthrope, in a voice which he hardly recognised as\nhis own.\n\n“By a snake?” came in excited chorus.\n\n“It fascinated them with its deadly, glittering eyes, one after the\nother, and struck them down while they stood helpless.  A bedridden\nneighbour, who wasn’t able to call for assistance, witnessed it all from\nher bedroom window.”\n\n“Well, I never!” broke in the chorus, with variations.\n\n“The interesting part of it is about the seventh pullet, the one that\ndidn’t get killed,” resumed Blenkinthrope, slowly lighting a cigarette.\nHis diffidence had left him, and he was beginning to realise how safe and\neasy depravity can seem once one has the courage to begin.  “The six dead\nbirds were Minorcas; the seventh was a Houdan with a mop of feathers all\nover its eyes.  It could hardly see the snake at all, so of course it\nwasn’t mesmerised like the others.  It just could see something wriggling\non the ground, and went for it and pecked it to death.”\n\n“Well, I’m blessed!” exclaimed the chorus.\n\nIn the course of the next few days Blenkinthrope discovered how little\nthe loss of one’s self-respect affects one when one has gained the esteem\nof the world.  His story found its way into one of the poultry papers,\nand was copied thence into a daily news-sheet as a matter of general\ninterest.  A lady wrote from the North of Scotland recounting a similar\nepisode which she had witnessed as occurring between a stoat and a blind\ngrouse.  Somehow a lie seems so much less reprehensible when one can call\nit a lee.\n\nFor awhile the adapter of the Seventh Pullet story enjoyed to the full\nhis altered standing as a person of consequence, one who had had some\nshare in the strange events of his times.  Then he was thrust once again\ninto the cold grey background by the sudden blossoming into importance of\nSmith-Paddon, a daily fellow-traveller, whose little girl had been\nknocked down and nearly hurt by a car belonging to a musical-comedy\nactress.  The actress was not in the car at the time, but she was in\nnumerous photographs which appeared in the illustrated papers of Zoto\nDobreen inquiring after the well-being of Maisie, daughter of Edmund\nSmith-Paddon, Esq.  With this new human interest to absorb them the\ntravelling companions were almost rude when Blenkinthrope tried to\nexplain his contrivance for keeping vipers and peregrine falcons out of\nhis chicken-run.\n\nGorworth, to whom he unburdened himself in private, gave him the same\ncounsel as heretofore.\n\n“Invent something.”\n\n“Yes, but what?”\n\nThe ready affirmative coupled with the question betrayed a significant\nshifting of the ethical standpoint.\n\nIt was a few days later that Blenkinthrope revealed a chapter of family\nhistory to the customary gathering in the railway carriage.\n\n“Curious thing happened to my aunt, the one who lives in Paris,” he\nbegan.  He had several aunts, but they were all geographically\ndistributed over Greater London.\n\n“She was sitting on a seat in the Bois the other afternoon, after\nlunching at the Roumanian Legation.”\n\nWhatever the story gained in picturesqueness from the dragging-in of\ndiplomatic “atmosphere,” it ceased from that moment to command any\nacceptance as a record of current events.  Gorworth had warned his\nneophyte that this would be the case, but the traditional enthusiasm of\nthe neophyte had triumphed over discretion.\n\n“She was feeling rather drowsy, the effect probably of the champagne,\nwhich she’s not in the habit of taking in the middle of the day.”\n\nA subdued murmur of admiration went round the company.  Blenkinthrope’s\naunts were not used to taking champagne in the middle of the year,\nregarding it exclusively as a Christmas and New Year accessory.\n\n“Presently a rather portly gentleman passed by her seat and paused an\ninstant to light a cigar.  At that moment a youngish man came up behind\nhim, drew the blade from a swordstick, and stabbed him half a dozen times\nthrough and through.  ‘Scoundrel,’ he cried to his victim, ‘you do not\nknow me.  My name is Henri Leturc.’  The elder man wiped away some of the\nblood that was spattering his clothes, turned to his assailant, and said:\n‘And since when has an attempted assassination been considered an\nintroduction?’  Then he finished lighting his cigar and walked away.  My\naunt had intended screaming for the police, but seeing the indifference\nwith which the principal in the affair treated the matter she felt that\nit would be an impertinence on her part to interfere.  Of course I need\nhardly say she put the whole thing down to the effects of a warm, drowsy\nafternoon and the Legation champagne.  Now comes the astonishing part of\nmy story.  A fortnight later a bank manager was stabbed to death with a\nswordstick in that very part of the Bois.  His assassin was the son of a\ncharwoman formerly working at the bank, who had been dismissed from her\njob by the manager on account of chronic intemperance.  His name was\nHenri Leturc.”\n\nFrom that moment Blenkinthrope was tacitly accepted as the Munchausen of\nthe party.  No effort was spared to draw him out from day to day in the\nexercise of testing their powers of credulity, and Blenkinthrope, in the\nfalse security of an assured and receptive audience, waxed industrious\nand ingenious in supplying the demand for marvels.  Duckby’s satirical\nstory of a tame otter that had a tank in the garden to swim in, and\nwhined restlessly whenever the water-rate was overdue, was scarcely an\nunfair parody of some of Blenkinthrope’s wilder efforts.  And then one\nday came Nemesis.\n\nReturning to his villa one evening Blenkinthrope found his wife sitting\nin front of a pack of cards, which she was scrutinising with unusual\nconcentration.\n\n“The same old patience-game?” he asked carelessly.\n\n“No, dear; this is the Death’s Head patience, the most difficult of them\nall.  I’ve never got it to work out, and somehow I should be rather\nfrightened if I did.  Mother only got it out once in her life; she was\nafraid of it, too.  Her great-aunt had done it once and fallen dead from\nexcitement the next moment, and mother always had a feeling that she\nwould die if she ever got it out.  She died the same night that she did\nit.  She was in bad health at the time, certainly, but it was a strange\ncoincidence.”\n\n“Don’t do it if it frightens you,” was Blenkinthrope’s practical comment\nas he left the room.  A few minutes later his wife called to him.\n\n“John, it gave me such a turn, I nearly got it out.  Only the five of\ndiamonds held me up at the end.  I really thought I’d done it.”\n\n“Why, you can do it,” said Blenkinthrope, who had come back to the room;\n“if you shift the eight of clubs on to that open nine the five can be\nmoved on to the six.”\n\nHis wife made the suggested move with hasty, trembling fingers, and piled\nthe outstanding cards on to their respective packs.  Then she followed\nthe example of her mother and great-grand-aunt.\n\nBlenkinthrope had been genuinely fond of his wife, but in the midst of\nhis bereavement one dominant thought obtruded itself.  Something\nsensational and real had at last come into his life; no longer was it a\ngrey, colourless record.  The headlines which might appropriately\ndescribe his domestic tragedy kept shaping themselves in his brain.\n“Inherited presentiment comes true.”  “The Death’s Head patience:\nCard-game that justified its sinister name in three generations.”  He\nwrote out a full story of the fatal occurrence for the _Essex Vedette_,\nthe editor of which was a friend of his, and to another friend he gave a\ncondensed account, to be taken up to the office of one of the halfpenny\ndailies.  But in both cases his reputation as a romancer stood fatally in\nthe way of the fulfilment of his ambitions.  “Not the right thing to be\nMunchausening in a time of sorrow” agreed his friends among themselves,\nand a brief note of regret at the “sudden death of the wife of our\nrespected neighbour, Mr. John Blenkinthrope, from heart failure,”\nappearing in the news column of the local paper was the forlorn outcome\nof his visions of widespread publicity.\n\nBlenkinthrope shrank from the society of his erstwhile travelling\ncompanions and took to travelling townwards by an earlier train.  He\nsometimes tries to enlist the sympathy and attention of a chance\nacquaintance in details of the whistling prowess of his best canary or\nthe dimensions of his largest beetroot; he scarcely recognises himself as\nthe man who was once spoken about and pointed out as the owner of the\nSeventh Pullet.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BLIND SPOT\n\n\n“You’ve just come back from Adelaide’s funeral, haven’t you?” said Sir\nLulworth to his nephew; “I suppose it was very like most other funerals?”\n\n“I’ll tell you all about it at lunch,” said Egbert.\n\n“You’ll do nothing of the sort.  It wouldn’t be respectful either to your\ngreat-aunt’s memory or to the lunch.  We begin with Spanish olives, then\na borshch, then more olives and a bird of some kind, and a rather\nenticing Rhenish wine, not at all expensive as wines go in this country,\nbut still quite laudable in its way.  Now there’s absolutely nothing in\nthat menu that harmonises in the least with the subject of your\ngreat-aunt Adelaide or her funeral.  She was a charming woman, and quite\nas intelligent as she had any need to be, but somehow she always reminded\nme of an English cook’s idea of a Madras curry.”\n\n“She used to say you were frivolous,” said Egbert.  Something in his tone\nsuggested that he rather endorsed the verdict.\n\n“I believe I once considerably scandalised her by declaring that clear\nsoup was a more important factor in life than a clear conscience.  She\nhad very little sense of proportion.  By the way, she made you her\nprincipal heir, didn’t she?”\n\n“Yes,” said Egbert, “and executor as well.  It’s in that connection that\nI particularly want to speak to you.”\n\n“Business is not my strong point at any time,” said Sir Lulworth, “and\ncertainly not when we’re on the immediate threshold of lunch.”\n\n“It isn’t exactly business,” explained Egbert, as he followed his uncle\ninto the dining-room.\n\n“It’s something rather serious.  Very serious.”\n\n“Then we can’t possibly speak about it now,” said Sir Lulworth; “no one\ncould talk seriously during a borshch.  A beautifully constructed\nborshch, such as you are going to experience presently, ought not only to\nbanish conversation but almost to annihilate thought.  Later on, when we\narrive at the second stage of olives, I shall be quite ready to discuss\nthat new book on Borrow, or, if you prefer it, the present situation in\nthe Grand Duchy of Luxemburg.  But I absolutely decline to talk anything\napproaching business till we have finished with the bird.”\n\nFor the greater part of the meal Egbert sat in an abstracted silence, the\nsilence of a man whose mind is focussed on one topic.  When the coffee\nstage had been reached he launched himself suddenly athwart his uncle’s\nreminiscences of the Court of Luxemburg.\n\n“I think I told you that great-aunt Adelaide had made me her executor.\nThere wasn’t very much to be done in the way of legal matters, but I had\nto go through her papers.”\n\n“That would be a fairly heavy task in itself.  I should imagine there\nwere reams of family letters.”\n\n“Stacks of them, and most of them highly uninteresting.  There was one\npacket, however, which I thought might repay a careful perusal.  It was a\nbundle of correspondence from her brother Peter.”\n\n“The Canon of tragic memory,” said Lulworth.\n\n“Exactly, of tragic memory, as you say; a tragedy that has never been\nfathomed.”\n\n“Probably the simplest explanation was the correct one,” said Sir\nLulworth; “he slipped on the stone staircase and fractured his skull in\nfalling.”\n\nEgbert shook his head.  “The medical evidence all went to prove that the\nblow on the head was struck by some one coming up behind him.  A wound\ncaused by violent contact with the steps could not possibly have been\ninflicted at that angle of the skull.  They experimented with a dummy\nfigure falling in every conceivable position.”\n\n“But the motive?” exclaimed Sir Lulworth; “no one had any interest in\ndoing away with him, and the number of people who destroy Canons of the\nEstablished Church for the mere fun of killing must be extremely limited.\nOf course there are individuals of weak mental balance who do that sort\nof thing, but they seldom conceal their handiwork; they are more\ngenerally inclined to parade it.”\n\n“His cook was under suspicion,” said Egbert shortly.\n\n“I know he was,” said Sir Lulworth, “simply because he was about the only\nperson on the premises at the time of the tragedy.  But could anything be\nsillier than trying to fasten a charge of murder on to Sebastien?  He had\nnothing to gain, in fact, a good deal to lose, from the death of his\nemployer.  The Canon was paying him quite as good wages as I was able to\noffer him when I took him over into my service.  I have since raised them\nto something a little more in accordance with his real worth, but at the\ntime he was glad to find a new place without troubling about an increase\nof wages.  People were fighting rather shy of him, and he had no friends\nin this country.  No; if anyone in the world was interested in the\nprolonged life and unimpaired digestion of the Canon it would certainly\nbe Sebastien.”\n\n“People don’t always weigh the consequences of their rash acts,” said\nEgbert, “otherwise there would be very few murders committed.  Sebastien\nis a man of hot temper.”\n\n“He is a southerner,” admitted Sir Lulworth; “to be geographically exact\nI believe he hails from the French slopes of the Pyrenees.  I took that\ninto consideration when he nearly killed the gardener’s boy the other day\nfor bringing him a spurious substitute for sorrel.  One must always make\nallowances for origin and locality and early environment; ‘Tell me your\nlongitude and I’ll know what latitude to allow you,’ is my motto.”\n\n“There, you see,” said Egbert, “he nearly killed the gardener’s boy.”\n\n“My dear Egbert, between nearly killing a gardener’s boy and altogether\nkilling a Canon there is a wide difference.  No doubt you have often felt\na temporary desire to kill a gardener’s boy; you have never given way to\nit, and I respect you for your self-control.  But I don’t suppose you\nhave ever wanted to kill an octogenarian Canon.  Besides, as far as we\nknow, there had never been any quarrel or disagreement between the two\nmen.  The evidence at the inquest brought that out very clearly.”\n\n“Ah!” said Egbert, with the air of a man coming at last into a deferred\ninheritance of conversational importance, “that is precisely what I want\nto speak to you about.”\n\nHe pushed away his coffee cup and drew a pocket-book from his inner\nbreast-pocket.  From the depths of the pocket-book he produced an\nenvelope, and from the envelope he extracted a letter, closely written in\na small, neat handwriting.\n\n“One of the Canon’s numerous letters to Aunt Adelaide,” he explained,\n“written a few days before his death.  Her memory was already failing\nwhen she received it, and I daresay she forgot the contents as soon as\nshe had read it; otherwise, in the light of what subsequently happened,\nwe should have heard something of this letter before now.  If it had been\nproduced at the inquest I fancy it would have made some difference in the\ncourse of affairs.  The evidence, as you remarked just now, choked off\nsuspicion against Sebastien by disclosing an utter absence of anything\nthat could be considered a motive or provocation for the crime, if crime\nthere was.”\n\n“Oh, read the letter,” said Sir Lulworth impatiently.\n\n“It’s a long rambling affair, like most of his letters in his later\nyears,” said Egbert.  “I’ll read the part that bears immediately on the\nmystery.\n\n“‘I very much fear I shall have to get rid of Sebastien.  He cooks\ndivinely, but he has the temper of a fiend or an anthropoid ape, and I am\nreally in bodily fear of him.  We had a dispute the other day as to the\ncorrect sort of lunch to be served on Ash Wednesday, and I got so\nirritated and annoyed at his conceit and obstinacy that at last I threw a\ncupful of coffee in his face and called him at the same time an impudent\njackanapes.  Very little of the coffee went actually in his face, but I\nhave never seen a human being show such deplorable lack of self-control.\nI laughed at the threat of killing me that he spluttered out in his rage,\nand thought the whole thing would blow over, but I have several times\nsince caught him scowling and muttering in a highly unpleasant fashion,\nand lately I have fancied that he was dogging my footsteps about the\ngrounds, particularly when I walk of an evening in the Italian Garden.’\n\n“It was on the steps in the Italian Garden that the body was found,”\ncommented Egbert, and resumed reading.\n\n“‘I daresay the danger is imaginary; but I shall feel more at ease when\nhe has quitted my service.’”\n\nEgbert paused for a moment at the conclusion of the extract; then, as his\nuncle made no remark, he added: “If lack of motive was the only factor\nthat saved Sebastien from prosecution I fancy this letter will put a\ndifferent complexion on matters.”\n\n“Have you shown it to anyone else?” asked Sir Lulworth, reaching out his\nhand for the incriminating piece of paper.\n\n“No,” said Egbert, handing it across the table, “I thought I would tell\nyou about it first.  Heavens, what are you doing?”\n\nEgbert’s voice rose almost to a scream.  Sir Lulworth had flung the paper\nwell and truly into the glowing centre of the grate.  The small, neat\nhandwriting shrivelled into black flaky nothingness.\n\n“What on earth did you do that for?” gasped Egbert.  “That letter was our\none piece of evidence to connect Sebastien with the crime.”\n\n“That is why I destroyed it,” said Sir Lulworth.\n\n“But why should you want to shield him?” cried Egbert; “the man is a\ncommon murderer.”\n\n“A common murderer, possibly, but a very uncommon cook.”\n\n\n\n\nDUSK\n\n\nNorman Gortsby sat on a bench in the Park, with his back to a strip of\nbush-planted sward, fenced by the park railings, and the Row fronting him\nacross a wide stretch of carriage drive.  Hyde Park Corner, with its\nrattle and hoot of traffic, lay immediately to his right.  It was some\nthirty minutes past six on an early March evening, and dusk had fallen\nheavily over the scene, dusk mitigated by some faint moonlight and many\nstreet lamps.  There was a wide emptiness over road and sidewalk, and yet\nthere were many unconsidered figures moving silently through the\nhalf-light, or dotted unobtrusively on bench and chair, scarcely to be\ndistinguished from the shadowed gloom in which they sat.\n\nThe scene pleased Gortsby and harmonised with his present mood.  Dusk, to\nhis mind, was the hour of the defeated.  Men and women, who had fought\nand lost, who hid their fallen fortunes and dead hopes as far as possible\nfrom the scrutiny of the curious, came forth in this hour of gloaming,\nwhen their shabby clothes and bowed shoulders and unhappy eyes might pass\nunnoticed, or, at any rate, unrecognised.\n\n    A king that is conquered must see strange looks,\n    So bitter a thing is the heart of man.\n\nThe wanderers in the dusk did not choose to have strange looks fasten on\nthem, therefore they came out in this bat-fashion, taking their pleasure\nsadly in a pleasure-ground that had emptied of its rightful occupants.\nBeyond the sheltering screen of bushes and palings came a realm of\nbrilliant lights and noisy, rushing traffic.  A blazing, many-tiered\nstretch of windows shone through the dusk and almost dispersed it,\nmarking the haunts of those other people, who held their own in life’s\nstruggle, or at any rate had not had to admit failure.  So Gortsby’s\nimagination pictured things as he sat on his bench in the almost deserted\nwalk.  He was in the mood to count himself among the defeated.  Money\ntroubles did not press on him; had he so wished he could have strolled\ninto the thoroughfares of light and noise, and taken his place among the\njostling ranks of those who enjoyed prosperity or struggled for it.  He\nhad failed in a more subtle ambition, and for the moment he was heartsore\nand disillusionised, and not disinclined to take a certain cynical\npleasure in observing and labelling his fellow wanderers as they went\ntheir ways in the dark stretches between the lamp-lights.\n\nOn the bench by his side sat an elderly gentleman with a drooping air of\ndefiance that was probably the remaining vestige of self-respect in an\nindividual who had ceased to defy successfully anybody or anything.  His\nclothes could scarcely be called shabby, at least they passed muster in\nthe half-light, but one’s imagination could not have pictured the wearer\nembarking on the purchase of a half-crown box of chocolates or laying out\nninepence on a carnation buttonhole.  He belonged unmistakably to that\nforlorn orchestra to whose piping no one dances; he was one of the\nworld’s lamenters who induce no responsive weeping.  As he rose to go\nGortsby imagined him returning to a home circle where he was snubbed and\nof no account, or to some bleak lodging where his ability to pay a weekly\nbill was the beginning and end of the interest he inspired.  His\nretreating figure vanished slowly into the shadows, and his place on the\nbench was taken almost immediately by a young man, fairly well dressed\nbut scarcely more cheerful of mien than his predecessor.  As if to\nemphasise the fact that the world went badly with him the new-corner\nunburdened himself of an angry and very audible expletive as he flung\nhimself into the seat.\n\n“You don’t seem in a very good temper,” said Gortsby, judging that he was\nexpected to take due notice of the demonstration.\n\nThe young man turned to him with a look of disarming frankness which put\nhim instantly on his guard.\n\n“You wouldn’t be in a good temper if you were in the fix I’m in,” he\nsaid; “I’ve done the silliest thing I’ve ever done in my life.”\n\n“Yes?” said Gortsby dispassionately.\n\n“Came up this afternoon, meaning to stay at the Patagonian Hotel in\nBerkshire Square,” continued the young man; “when I got there I found it\nhad been pulled down some weeks ago and a cinema theatre run up on the\nsite.  The taxi driver recommended me to another hotel some way off and I\nwent there.  I just sent a letter to my people, giving them the address,\nand then I went out to buy some soap—I’d forgotten to pack any and I hate\nusing hotel soap.  Then I strolled about a bit, had a drink at a bar and\nlooked at the shops, and when I came to turn my steps back to the hotel I\nsuddenly realised that I didn’t remember its name or even what street it\nwas in.  There’s a nice predicament for a fellow who hasn’t any friends\nor connections in London!  Of course I can wire to my people for the\naddress, but they won’t have got my letter till to-morrow; meantime I’m\nwithout any money, came out with about a shilling on me, which went in\nbuying the soap and getting the drink, and here I am, wandering about\nwith twopence in my pocket and nowhere to go for the night.”\n\nThere was an eloquent pause after the story had been told.  “I suppose\nyou think I’ve spun you rather an impossible yarn,” said the young man\npresently, with a suggestion of resentment in his voice.\n\n“Not at all impossible,” said Gortsby judicially; “I remember doing\nexactly the same thing once in a foreign capital, and on that occasion\nthere were two of us, which made it more remarkable.  Luckily we\nremembered that the hotel was on a sort of canal, and when we struck the\ncanal we were able to find our way back to the hotel.”\n\nThe youth brightened at the reminiscence.  “In a foreign city I wouldn’t\nmind so much,” he said; “one could go to one’s Consul and get the\nrequisite help from him.  Here in one’s own land one is far more derelict\nif one gets into a fix.  Unless I can find some decent chap to swallow my\nstory and lend me some money I seem likely to spend the night on the\nEmbankment.  I’m glad, anyhow, that you don’t think the story\noutrageously improbable.”\n\nHe threw a good deal of warmth into the last remark, as though perhaps to\nindicate his hope that Gortsby did not fall far short of the requisite\ndecency.\n\n“Of course,” said Gortsby slowly, “the weak point of your story is that\nyou can’t produce the soap.”\n\nThe young man sat forward hurriedly, felt rapidly in the pockets of his\novercoat, and then jumped to his feet.\n\n“I must have lost it,” he muttered angrily.\n\n“To lose an hotel and a cake of soap on one afternoon suggests wilful\ncarelessness,” said Gortsby, but the young man scarcely waited to hear\nthe end of the remark.  He flitted away down the path, his head held\nhigh, with an air of somewhat jaded jauntiness.\n\n“It was a pity,” mused Gortsby; “the going out to get one’s own soap was\nthe one convincing touch in the whole story, and yet it was just that\nlittle detail that brought him to grief.  If he had had the brilliant\nforethought to provide himself with a cake of soap, wrapped and sealed\nwith all the solicitude of the chemist’s counter, he would have been a\ngenius in his particular line.  In his particular line genius certainly\nconsists of an infinite capacity for taking precautions.”\n\nWith that reflection Gortsby rose to go; as he did so an exclamation of\nconcern escaped him.  Lying on the ground by the side of the bench was a\nsmall oval packet, wrapped and sealed with the solicitude of a chemist’s\ncounter.  It could be nothing else but a cake of soap, and it had\nevidently fallen out of the youth’s overcoat pocket when he flung himself\ndown on the seat.  In another moment Gortsby was scudding along the\ndusk-shrouded path in anxious quest for a youthful figure in a light\novercoat.  He had nearly given up the search when he caught sight of the\nobject of his pursuit standing irresolutely on the border of the carriage\ndrive, evidently uncertain whether to strike across the Park or make for\nthe bustling pavements of Knightsbridge.  He turned round sharply with an\nair of defensive hostility when he found Gortsby hailing him.\n\n“The important witness to the genuineness of your story has turned up,”\nsaid Gortsby, holding out the cake of soap; “it must have slid out of\nyour overcoat pocket when you sat down on the seat.  I saw it on the\nground after you left.  You must excuse my disbelief, but appearances\nwere really rather against you, and now, as I appealed to the testimony\nof the soap I think I ought to abide by its verdict.  If the loan of a\nsovereign is any good to you—”\n\nThe young man hastily removed all doubt on the subject by pocketing the\ncoin.\n\n“Here is my card with my address,” continued Gortsby; “any day this week\nwill do for returning the money, and here is the soap—don’t lose it again\nit’s been a good friend to you.”\n\n“Lucky thing your finding it,” said the youth, and then, with a catch in\nhis voice, he blurted out a word or two of thanks and fled headlong in\nthe direction of Knightsbridge.\n\n“Poor boy, he as nearly as possible broke down,” said Gortsby to himself.\n“I don’t wonder either; the relief from his quandary must have been\nacute.  It’s a lesson to me not to be too clever in judging by\ncircumstances.”\n\nAs Gortsby retraced his steps past the seat where the little drama had\ntaken place he saw an elderly gentleman poking and peering beneath it and\non all sides of it, and recognised his earlier fellow occupant.\n\n“Have you lost anything, sir?” he asked.\n\n“Yes, sir, a cake of soap.”\n\n\n\n\nA TOUCH OF REALISM\n\n\n“I hope you’ve come full of suggestions for Christmas,” said Lady Blonze\nto her latest arrived guest; “the old-fashioned Christmas and the\nup-to-date Christmas are both so played out.  I want to have something\nreally original this year.”\n\n“I was staying with the Mathesons last month,” said Blanche Boveal\neagerly, “and we had such a good idea.  Every one in the house-party had\nto be a character and behave consistently all the time, and at the end of\nthe visit one had to guess what every one’s character was.  The one who\nwas voted to have acted his or her character best got a prize.”\n\n“It sounds amusing,” said Lady Blonze.\n\n“I was St. Francis of Assisi,” continued Blanche; “we hadn’t got to keep\nto our right sexes.  I kept getting up in the middle of a meal, and\nthrowing out food to the birds; you see, the chief thing that one\nremembers of St. Francis is that he was fond of the birds.  Every one was\nso stupid about it, and thought that I was the old man who feeds the\nsparrows in the Tuileries Gardens.  Then Colonel Pentley was the Jolly\nMiller on the banks of Dee.”\n\n“How on earth did he do that?” asked Bertie van Tahn.\n\n“‘He laughed and sang from morn till night,’” explained Blanche.\n\n“How dreadful for the rest of you,” said Bertie; “and anyway he wasn’t on\nthe banks of Dee.”\n\n“One had to imagine that,” said Blanche.\n\n“If you could imagine all that you might as well imagine cattle on the\nfurther bank and keep on calling them home, Mary-fashion, across the\nsands of Dee.  Or you might change the river to the Yarrow and imagine it\nwas on the top of you, and say you were Willie, or whoever it was,\ndrowned in Yarrow.”\n\n“Of course it’s easy to make fun of it,” said Blanche sharply, “but it\nwas extremely interesting and amusing.  The prize was rather a fiasco,\nthough.  You see, Millie Matheson said her character was Lady Bountiful,\nand as she was our hostess of course we all had to vote that she had\ncarried out her character better than anyone.  Otherwise I ought to have\ngot the prize.”\n\n“It’s quite an idea for a Christmas party,” said Lady Blonze; “we must\ncertainly do it here.”\n\nSir Nicholas was not so enthusiastic.  “Are you quite sure, my dear, that\nyou’re wise in doing this thing?” he said to his wife when they were\nalone together.  “It might do very well at the Mathesons, where they had\nrather a staid, elderly house-party, but here it will be a different\nmatter.  There is the Durmot flapper, for instance, who simply stops at\nnothing, and you know what Van Tahn is like.  Then there is Cyril\nSkatterly; he has madness on one side of his family and a Hungarian\ngrandmother on the other.”\n\n“I don’t see what they could do that would matter,” said Lady Blonze.\n\n“It’s the unknown that is to be dreaded,” said Sir Nicholas.  “If\nSkatterly took it into his head to represent a Bull of Bashan, well, I’d\nrather not be here.”\n\n“Of course we shan’t allow any Bible characters.  Besides, I don’t know\nwhat the Bulls of Bashan really did that was so very dreadful; they just\ncame round and gaped, as far as I remember.”\n\n“My dear, you don’t know what Skatterly’s Hungarian imagination mightn’t\nread into the part; it would be small satisfaction to say to him\nafterwards: ‘You’ve behaved as no Bull of Bashan would have behaved.’”\n\n“Oh, you’re an alarmist,” said Lady Blonze; “I particularly want to have\nthis idea carried out.  It will be sure to be talked about a lot.”\n\n“That is quite possible,” said Sir Nicholas.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nDinner that evening was not a particularly lively affair; the strain of\ntrying to impersonate a self-imposed character or to glean hints of\nidentity from other people’s conduct acted as a check on the natural\nfestivity of such a gathering.  There was a general feeling of gratitude\nand acquiescence when good-natured Rachel Klammerstein suggested that\nthere should be an hour or two’s respite from “the game” while they all\nlistened to a little piano-playing after dinner.  Rachel’s love of piano\nmusic was not indiscriminate, and concentrated itself chiefly on\nselections rendered by her idolised offspring, Moritz and Augusta, who,\nto do them justice, played remarkably well.\n\nThe Klammersteins were deservedly popular as Christmas guests; they gave\nexpensive gifts lavishly on Christmas Day and New Year, and Mrs.\nKlammerstein had already dropped hints of her intention to present the\nprize for the best enacted character in the game competition.  Every one\nhad brightened at this prospect; if it had fallen to Lady Blonze, as\nhostess, to provide the prize, she would have considered that a little\nsouvenir of some twenty or twenty-five shillings’ value would meet the\ncase, whereas coming from a Klammerstein source it would certainly run to\nseveral guineas.\n\nThe close time for impersonation efforts came to an end with the final\nwithdrawal of Moritz and Augusta from the piano.  Blanche Boveal retired\nearly, leaving the room in a series of laboured leaps that she hoped\nmight be recognised as a tolerable imitation of Pavlova.  Vera Durmot,\nthe sixteen-year-old flapper, expressed her confident opinion that the\nperformance was intended to typify Mark Twain’s famous jumping frog, and\nher diagnosis of the case found general acceptance.  Another guest to set\nan example of early bed-going was Waldo Plubley, who conducted his life\non a minutely regulated system of time-tables and hygienic routine.\nWaldo was a plump, indolent young man of seven-and-twenty, whose mother\nhad early in his life decided for him that he was unusually delicate, and\nby dint of much coddling and home-keeping had succeeded in making him\nphysically soft and mentally peevish.  Nine hours’ unbroken sleep,\npreceded by elaborate breathing exercises and other hygienic ritual, was\namong the indispensable regulations which Waldo imposed on himself, and\nthere were innumerable small observances which he exacted from those who\nwere in any way obliged to minister to his requirements; a special teapot\nfor the decoction of his early tea was always solemnly handed over to the\nbedroom staff of any house in which he happened to be staying.  No one\nhad ever quite mastered the mechanism of this precious vessel, but Bertie\nvan Tahn was responsible for the legend that its spout had to be kept\nfacing north during the process of infusion.\n\nOn this particular night the irreducible nine hours were severely\nmutilated by the sudden and by no means noiseless incursion of a\npyjama-clad figure into Waldo’s room at an hour midway between midnight\nand dawn.\n\n“What is the matter?  What are you looking for?” asked the awakened and\nastonished Waldo, slowly recognising Van Tahn, who appeared to be\nsearching hastily for something he had lost.\n\n“Looking for sheep,” was the reply.\n\n“Sheep?” exclaimed Waldo.\n\n“Yes, sheep.  You don’t suppose I’m looking for giraffes, do you?”\n\n“I don’t see why you should expect to find either in my room,” retorted\nWaldo furiously.\n\n“I can’t argue the matter at this hour of the night,” said Bertie, and\nbegan hastily rummaging in the chest of drawers.  Shirts and underwear\nwent flying on to the floor.\n\n“There are no sheep here, I tell you,” screamed Waldo.\n\n“I’ve only got your word for it,” said Bertie, whisking most of the\nbedclothes on to the floor; “if you weren’t concealing something you\nwouldn’t be so agitated.”\n\nWaldo was by this time convinced that Van Tahn was raving mad, and made\nan anxious effort to humour him.\n\n“Go back to bed like a dear fellow,” he pleaded, “and your sheep will\nturn up all right in the morning.”\n\n“I daresay,” said Bertie gloomily, “without their tails.  Nice fool I\nshall look with a lot of Manx sheep.”\n\nAnd by way of emphasising his annoyance at the prospect he sent Waldo’s\npillows flying to the top of the wardrobe.\n\n“But _why_ no tails?” asked Waldo, whose teeth were chattering with fear\nand rage and lowered temperature.\n\n“My dear boy, have you never heard the ballad of Little Bo-Peep?” said\nBertie with a chuckle.  “It’s my character in the Game, you know.  If I\ndidn’t go hunting about for my lost sheep no one would be able to guess\nwho I was; and now go to sleepy weeps like a good child or I shall be\ncross with you.”\n\n“I leave you to imagine,” wrote Waldo in the course of a long letter to\nhis mother, “how much sleep I was able to recover that night, and you\nknow how essential nine uninterrupted hours of slumber are to my health.”\n\nOn the other hand he was able to devote some wakeful hours to exercises\nin breathing wrath and fury against Bertie van Tahn.\n\nBreakfast at Blonzecourt was a scattered meal, on the “come when you\nplease” principle, but the house-party was supposed to gather in full\nstrength at lunch.  On the day after the “Game” had been started there\nwere, however, some notable absentees.  Waldo Plubley, for instance, was\nreported to be nursing a headache.  A large breakfast and an “A.B.C.” had\nbeen taken up to his room, but he had made no appearance in the flesh.\n\n“I expect he’s playing up to some character,” said Vera Durmot; “isn’t\nthere a thing of Molière’s, ‘_Le Malade Imaginaire_’?  I expect he’s\nthat.”\n\nEight or nine lists came out, and were duly pencilled with the\nsuggestion.\n\n“And where are the Klammersteins?” asked Lady Blonze; “they’re usually so\npunctual.”\n\n“Another character pose, perhaps,” said Bertie van Tahn; “‘the Lost Ten\nTribes.’”\n\n“But there are only three of them.  Besides, they’ll want their lunch.\nHasn’t anyone seen anything of them?”\n\n“Didn’t you take them out in your car?” asked Blanche Boveal, addressing\nherself to Cyril Skatterly.\n\n“Yes, took them out to Slogberry Moor immediately after breakfast.  Miss\nDurmot came too.”\n\n“I saw you and Vera come back,” said Lady Blonze, “but I didn’t see the\nKlammersteins.  Did you put them down in the village?”\n\n“No,” said Skatterly shortly.\n\n“But where are they?  Where did you leave them?”\n\n“We left them on Slogberry Moor,” said Vera calmly.\n\n“On Slogberry Moor?  Why, it’s more than thirty miles away!  How are they\ngoing to get back?”\n\n“We didn’t stop to consider that,” said Skatterly; “we asked them to get\nout for a moment, on the pretence that the car had stuck, and then we\ndashed off full speed and left them there.”\n\n“But how dare you do such a thing?  It’s most inhuman!  Why, it’s been\nsnowing for the last hour.”\n\n“I expect there’ll be a cottage or farmhouse somewhere if they walk a\nmile or two.”\n\n“But why on earth have you done it?”\n\nThe question came in a chorus of indignant bewilderment.\n\n“_That_ would be telling what our characters are meant to be,” said Vera.\n\n“Didn’t I warn you?” said Sir Nicholas tragically to his wife.\n\n“It’s something to do with Spanish history; we don’t mind giving you that\nclue,” said Skatterly, helping himself cheerfully to salad, and then\nBertie van Tahn broke forth into peals of joyous laughter.\n\n“I’ve got it!  Ferdinand and Isabella deporting the Jews!  Oh, lovely!\nThose two have certainly won the prize; we shan’t get anything to beat\nthat for thoroughness.”\n\nLady Blonze’s Christmas party was talked about and written about to an\nextent that she had not anticipated in her most ambitious moments.  The\nletters from Waldo’s mother would alone have made it memorable.\n\n\n\n\nCOUSIN TERESA\n\n\nBasset Harrowcluff returned to the home of his fathers, after an absence\nof four years, distinctly well pleased with himself.  He was only\nthirty-one, but he had put in some useful service in an out-of-the-way,\nthough not unimportant, corner of the world.  He had quieted a province,\nkept open a trade route, enforced the tradition of respect which is worth\nthe ransom of many kings in out-of-the-way regions, and done the whole\nbusiness on rather less expenditure than would be requisite for\norganising a charity in the home country.  In Whitehall and places where\nthey think, they doubtless thought well of him.  It was not\ninconceivable, his father allowed himself to imagine, that Basset’s name\nmight figure in the next list of Honours.\n\nBasset was inclined to be rather contemptuous of his half-brother, Lucas,\nwhom he found feverishly engrossed in the same medley of elaborate\nfutilities that had claimed his whole time and energies, such as they\nwere, four years ago, and almost as far back before that as he could\nremember.  It was the contempt of the man of action for the man of\nactivities, and it was probably reciprocated.  Lucas was an over-well\nnourished individual, some nine years Basset’s senior, with a colouring\nthat would have been accepted as a sign of intensive culture in an\nasparagus, but probably meant in this case mere abstention from exercise.\nHis hair and forehead furnished a recessional note in a personality that\nwas in all other respects obtrusive and assertive.  There was certainly\nno Semitic blood in Lucas’s parentage, but his appearance contrived to\nconvey at least a suggestion of Jewish extraction.  Clovis Sangrail, who\nknew most of his associates by sight, said it was undoubtedly a case of\nprotective mimicry.\n\nTwo days after Basset’s return, Lucas frisked in to lunch in a state of\ntwittering excitement that could not be restrained even for the immediate\nconsideration of soup, but had to be verbally discharged in spluttering\ncompetition with mouthfuls of vermicelli.\n\n“I’ve got hold of an idea for something immense,” he babbled, “something\nthat is simply It.”\n\nBasset gave a short laugh that would have done equally well as a snort,\nif one had wanted to make the exchange.  His half-brother was in the\nhabit of discovering futilities that were “simply It” at frequently\nrecurring intervals.  The discovery generally meant that he flew up to\ntown, preceded by glowingly-worded telegrams, to see some one connected\nwith the stage or the publishing world, got together one or two momentous\nluncheon parties, flitted in and out of “Gambrinus” for one or two\nevenings, and returned home with an air of subdued importance and the\nasparagus tint slightly intensified.  The great idea was generally\nforgotten a few weeks later in the excitement of some new discovery.\n\n“The inspiration came to me whilst I was dressing,” announced Lucas; “it\nwill be _the_ thing in the next music-hall _revue_.  All London will go\nmad over it.  It’s just a couplet; of course there will be other words,\nbut they won’t matter.  Listen:\n\n    Cousin Teresa takes out Cæsar,\n    Fido, Jock, and the big borzoi.\n\nA lifting, catchy sort of refrain, you see, and big-drum business on the\ntwo syllables of bor-zoi.  It’s immense.  And I’ve thought out all the\nbusiness of it; the singer will sing the first verse alone, then during\nthe second verse Cousin Teresa will walk through, followed by four wooden\ndogs on wheels; Cæsar will be an Irish terrier, Fido a black poodle, Jock\na fox-terrier, and the borzoi, of course, will be a borzoi.  During the\nthird verse Cousin Teresa will come on alone, and the dogs will be drawn\nacross by themselves from the opposite wing; then Cousin Teresa will\ncatch on to the singer and go off-stage in one direction, while the dogs’\nprocession goes off in the other, crossing en route, which is always very\neffective.  There’ll be a lot of applause there, and for the fourth verse\nCousin Teresa will come on in sables and the dogs will all have coats on.\nThen I’ve got a great idea for the fifth verse; each of the dogs will be\nled on by a Nut, and Cousin Teresa will come on from the opposite side,\ncrossing en route, always effective, and then she turns round and leads\nthe whole lot of them off on a string, and all the time every one singing\nlike mad:\n\n    Cousin Teresa takes out Cæsar\n    Fido, Jock, and the big borzoi.\n\nTum-Tum!  Drum business on the two last syllables.  I’m so excited, I\nshan’t sleep a wink to-night.  I’m off to-morrow by the ten-fifteen.\nI’ve wired to Hermanova to lunch with me.”\n\nIf any of the rest of the family felt any excitement over the creation of\nCousin Teresa, they were signally successful in concealing the fact.\n\n“Poor Lucas does take his silly little ideas seriously,” said Colonel\nHarrowcluff afterwards in the smoking-room.\n\n“Yes,” said his younger son, in a slightly less tolerant tone, “in a day\nor two he’ll come back and tell us that his sensational masterpiece is\nabove the heads of the public, and in about three weeks’ time he’ll be\nwild with enthusiasm over a scheme to dramatise the poems of Herrick or\nsomething equally promising.”\n\nAnd then an extraordinary thing befell.  In defiance of all precedent\nLucas’s glowing anticipations were justified and endorsed by the course\nof events.  If Cousin Teresa was above the heads of the public, the\npublic heroically adapted itself to her altitude.  Introduced as an\nexperiment at a dull moment in a new _revue_, the success of the item was\nunmistakable; the calls were so insistent and uproarious that even Lucas’\nample devisings of additional “business” scarcely sufficed to keep pace\nwith the demand.  Packed houses on successive evenings confirmed the\nverdict of the first night audience, stalls and boxes filled\nsignificantly just before the turn came on, and emptied significantly\nafter the last _encore_ had been given.  The manager tearfully\nacknowledged that Cousin Teresa was It.  Stage hands and supers and\nprogramme sellers acknowledged it to one another without the least\nreservation.  The name of the _revue_ dwindled to secondary importance,\nand vast letters of electric blue blazoned the words “Cousin Teresa” from\nthe front of the great palace of pleasure.  And, of course, the magic of\nthe famous refrain laid its spell all over the Metropolis.  Restaurant\nproprietors were obliged to provide the members of their orchestras with\npainted wooden dogs on wheels, in order that the much-demanded and always\nconceded melody should be rendered with the necessary spectacular\neffects, and the crash of bottles and forks on the tables at the mention\nof the big borzoi usually drowned the sincerest efforts of drum or\ncymbals.  Nowhere and at no time could one get away from the double thump\nthat brought up the rear of the refrain; revellers reeling home at night\nbanged it on doors and hoardings, milkmen clashed their cans to its\ncadence, messenger boys hit smaller messenger boys resounding double\nsmacks on the same principle.  And the more thoughtful circles of the\ngreat city were not deaf to the claims and significance of the popular\nmelody.  An enterprising and emancipated preacher discoursed from his\npulpit on the inner meaning of “Cousin Teresa,” and Lucas Harrowcluff was\ninvited to lecture on the subject of his great achievement to members of\nthe Young Mens’ Endeavour League, the Nine Arts Club, and other learned\nand willing-to-learn bodies.  In Society it seemed to be the one thing\npeople really cared to talk about; men and women of middle age and\naverage education might be seen together in corners earnestly discussing,\nnot the question whether Servia should have an outlet on the Adriatic, or\nthe possibilities of a British success in international polo contests,\nbut the more absorbing topic of the problematic Aztec or Nilotic origin\nof the Teresa _motiv_.\n\n“Politics and patriotism are so boring and so out of date,” said a\nrevered lady who had some pretensions to oracular utterance; “we are too\ncosmopolitan nowadays to be really moved by them.  That is why one\nwelcomes an intelligible production like ‘Cousin Teresa,’ that has a\ngenuine message for one.  One can’t understand the message all at once,\nof course, but one felt from the very first that it was there.  I’ve been\nto see it eighteen times and I’m going again to-morrow and on Thursday.\nOne can’t see it often enough.”\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n“It would be rather a popular move if we gave this Harrowcluff person a\nknighthood or something of the sort,” said the Minister reflectively.\n\n“Which Harrowcluff?” asked his secretary.\n\n“Which?  There is only one, isn’t there?” said the Minister; “the ‘Cousin\nTeresa’ man, of course.  I think every one would be pleased if we\nknighted him.  Yes, you can put him down on the list of certainties—under\nthe letter L.”\n\n“The letter L,” said the secretary, who was new to his job; “does that\nstand for Liberalism or liberality?”\n\nMost of the recipients of Ministerial favour were expected to qualify in\nboth of those subjects.\n\n“Literature,” explained the Minister.\n\nAnd thus, after a fashion, Colonel Harrowcluff’s expectation of seeing\nhis son’s name in the list of Honours was gratified.\n\n\n\n\nTHE YARKAND MANNER\n\n\nSir Lulworth Quayne was making a leisurely progress through the\nZoological Society’s Gardens in company with his nephew, recently\nreturned from Mexico.  The latter was interested in comparing and\ncontrasting allied types of animals occurring in the North American and\nOld World fauna.\n\n“One of the most remarkable things in the wanderings of species,” he\nobserved, “is the sudden impulse to trek and migrate that breaks out now\nand again, for no apparent reason, in communities of hitherto\nstay-at-home animals.”\n\n“In human affairs the same phenomenon is occasionally noticeable,” said\nSir Lulworth; “perhaps the most striking instance of it occurred in this\ncountry while you were away in the wilds of Mexico.  I mean the wander\nfever which suddenly displayed itself in the managing and editorial\nstaffs of certain London newspapers.  It began with the stampede of the\nentire staff of one of our most brilliant and enterprising weeklies to\nthe banks of the Seine and the heights of Montmartre.  The migration was\na brief one, but it heralded an era of restlessness in the Press world\nwhich lent quite a new meaning to the phrase ‘newspaper circulation.’\nOther editorial staffs were not slow to imitate the example that had been\nset them.  Paris soon dropped out of fashion as being too near home;\nNürnberg, Seville, and Salonica became more favoured as planting-out\ngrounds for the personnel of not only weekly but daily papers as well.\nThe localities were perhaps not always well chosen; the fact of a leading\norgan of Evangelical thought being edited for two successive fortnights\nfrom Trouville and Monte Carlo was generally admitted to have been a\nmistake.  And even when enterprising and adventurous editors took\nthemselves and their staffs further afield there were some unavoidable\nclashings.  For instance, the _Scrutator_, _Sporting Bluff_, and _The\nDamsels’ Own Paper_ all pitched on Khartoum for the same week.  It was,\nperhaps, a desire to out-distance all possible competition that\ninfluenced the management of the _Daily Intelligencer_, one of the most\nsolid and respected organs of Liberal opinion, in its decision to\ntransfer its offices for three or four weeks from Fleet Street to Eastern\nTurkestan, allowing, of course, a necessary margin of time for the\njourney there and back.  This was, in many respects, the most remarkable\nof all the Press stampedes that were experienced at this time.  There was\nno make-believe about the undertaking; proprietor, manager, editor,\nsub-editors, leader-writers, principal reporters, and so forth, all took\npart in what was popularly alluded to as the _Drang nach Osten_; an\nintelligent and efficient office-boy was all that was left in the\ndeserted hive of editorial industry.”\n\n“That was doing things rather thoroughly, wasn’t it?” said the nephew.\n\n“Well, you see,” said Sir Lulworth, “the migration idea was falling\nsomewhat into disrepute from the half-hearted manner in which it was\noccasionally carried out.  You were not impressed by the information that\nsuch and such a paper was being edited and brought out at Lisbon or\nInnsbruck if you chanced to see the principal leader-writer or the art\neditor lunching as usual at their accustomed restaurants.  The _Daily\nIntelligencer_ was determined to give no loophole for cavil at the\ngenuineness of its pilgrimage, and it must be admitted that to a certain\nextent the arrangements made for transmitting copy and carrying on the\nusual features of the paper during the long outward journey worked\nsmoothly and well.  The series of articles which commenced at Baku on\n‘What Cobdenism might do for the camel industry’ ranks among the best of\nthe recent contributions to Free Trade literature, while the views on\nforeign policy enunciated ‘from a roof in Yarkand’ showed at least as\nmuch grasp of the international situation as those that had germinated\nwithin half a mile of Downing Street.  Quite in keeping, too, with the\nolder and better traditions of British journalism was the manner of the\nhome-coming; no bombast, no personal advertisement, no flamboyant\ninterviews.  Even a complimentary luncheon at the Voyagers’ Club was\ncourteously declined.  Indeed, it began to be felt that the\nself-effacement of the returned pressmen was being carried to a pedantic\nlength.  Foreman compositors, advertisement clerks, and other members of\nthe non-editorial staff, who had, of course, taken no part in the great\ntrek, found it as impossible to get into direct communication with the\neditor and his satellites now that they had returned as when they had\nbeen excusably inaccessible in Central Asia.  The sulky, overworked\noffice-boy, who was the one connecting link between the editorial brain\nand the business departments of the paper, sardonically explained the new\naloofness as the ‘Yarkand manner.’  Most of the reporters and sub-editors\nseemed to have been dismissed in autocratic fashion since their return\nand new ones engaged by letter; to these the editor and his immediate\nassociates remained an unseen presence, issuing its instructions solely\nthrough the medium of curt typewritten notes.  Something mystic and\nTibetan and forbidden had replaced the human bustle and democratic\nsimplicity of pre-migration days, and the same experience was encountered\nby those who made social overtures to the returned wanderers.  The most\nbrilliant hostess of Twentieth Century London flung the pearl of her\nhospitality into the unresponsive trough of the editorial letter-box; it\nseemed as if nothing short of a Royal command would drag the\nhermit-souled _revenants_ from their self-imposed seclusion.  People\nbegan to talk unkindly of the effect of high altitudes and Eastern\natmosphere on minds and temperaments unused to such luxuries.  The\nYarkand manner was not popular.”\n\n“And the contents of the paper,” said the nephew, “did they show the\ninfluence of the new style?”\n\n“Ah!” said Sir Lulworth, “that was the exciting thing.  In home affairs,\nsocial questions, and the ordinary events of the day not much change was\nnoticeable.  A certain Oriental carelessness seemed to have crept into\nthe editorial department, and perhaps a note of lassitude not unnatural\nin the work of men who had returned from what had been a fairly arduous\njourney.  The aforetime standard of excellence was scarcely maintained,\nbut at any rate the general lines of policy and outlook were not departed\nfrom.  It was in the realm of foreign affairs that a startling change\ntook place.  Blunt, forcible, outspoken articles appeared, couched in\nlanguage which nearly turned the autumn manœuvres of six important Powers\ninto mobilisations.  Whatever else the _Daily Intelligencer_ had learned\nin the East, it had not acquired the art of diplomatic ambiguity.  The\nman in the street enjoyed the articles and bought the paper as he had\nnever bought it before; the men in Downing Street took a different view.\nThe Foreign Secretary, hitherto accounted a rather reticent man, became\npositively garrulous in the course of perpetually disavowing the\nsentiments expressed in the _Daily Intelligencer’s_ leaders; and then one\nday the Government came to the conclusion that something definite and\ndrastic must be done.  A deputation, consisting of the Prime Minister,\nthe Foreign Secretary, four leading financiers, and a well-known\nNonconformist divine, made its way to the offices of the paper.  At the\ndoor leading to the editorial department the way was barred by a nervous\nbut defiant office-boy.\n\n“‘You can’t see the editor nor any of the staff,’ he announced.\n\n“‘We insist on seeing the editor or some responsible person,’ said the\nPrime Minister, and the deputation forced its way in.  The boy had spoken\ntruly; there was no one to be seen.  In the whole suite of rooms there\nwas no sign of human life.\n\n“‘Where is the editor?’  ‘Or the foreign editor?’  ‘Or the chief\nleader-writer?  Or anybody?’\n\n“In answer to the shower of questions the boy unlocked a drawer and\nproduced a strange-looking envelope, which bore a Khokand postmark, and a\ndate of some seven or eight months back.  It contained a scrap of paper\non which was written the following message:\n\n    “‘Entire party captured by brigand tribe on homeward journey.\n    Quarter of million demanded as ransom, but would probably take less.\n    Inform Government, relations, and friends.’\n\n“There followed the signatures of the principal members of the party and\ninstructions as to how and where the money was to be paid.\n\n“The letter had been directed to the office-boy-in-charge, who had\nquietly suppressed it.  No one is a hero to one’s own office-boy, and he\nevidently considered that a quarter of a million was an unwarrantable\noutlay for such a doubtfully advantageous object as the repatriation of\nan errant newspaper staff.  So he drew the editorial and other salaries,\nforged what signatures were necessary, engaged new reporters, did what\nsub-editing he could, and made as much use as possible of the large\naccumulation of special articles that was held in reserve for\nemergencies.  The articles on foreign affairs were entirely his own\ncomposition.\n\n“Of course the whole thing had to be kept as quiet as possible; an\ninterim staff, pledged to secrecy, was appointed to keep the paper going\ntill the pining captives could be sought out, ransomed, and brought home,\nin twos and threes to escape notice, and gradually things were put back\non their old footing.  The articles on foreign affairs reverted to the\nwonted traditions of the paper.”\n\n“But,” interposed the nephew, “how on earth did the boy account to the\nrelatives all those months for the non-appearance—”\n\n“That,” said Sir Lulworth, “was the most brilliant stroke of all.  To the\nwife or nearest relative of each of the missing men he forwarded a\nletter, copying the handwriting of the supposed writer as well as he\ncould, and making excuses about vile pens and ink; in each letter he told\nthe same story, varying only the locality, to the effect that the writer,\nalone of the whole party, was unable to tear himself away from the wild\nliberty and allurements of Eastern life, and was going to spend several\nmonths roaming in some selected region.  Many of the wives started off\nimmediately in pursuit of their errant husbands, and it took the\nGovernment a considerable time and much trouble to reclaim them from\ntheir fruitless quests along the banks of the Oxus, the Gobi Desert, the\nOrenburg steppe, and other outlandish places.  One of them, I believe, is\nstill lost somewhere in the Tigris Valley.”\n\n“And the boy?”\n\n“Is still in journalism.”\n\n\n\n\nTHE BYZANTINE OMELETTE\n\n\nSophie Chattel-Monkheim was a Socialist by conviction and a\nChattel-Monkheim by marriage.  The particular member of that wealthy\nfamily whom she had married was rich, even as his relatives counted\nriches.  Sophie had very advanced and decided views as to the\ndistribution of money: it was a pleasing and fortunate circumstance that\nshe also had the money.  When she inveighed eloquently against the evils\nof capitalism at drawing-room meetings and Fabian conferences she was\nconscious of a comfortable feeling that the system, with all its\ninequalities and iniquities, would probably last her time.  It is one of\nthe consolations of middle-aged reformers that the good they inculcate\nmust live after them if it is to live at all.\n\nOn a certain spring evening, somewhere towards the dinner-hour, Sophie\nsat tranquilly between her mirror and her maid, undergoing the process of\nhaving her hair built into an elaborate reflection of the prevailing\nfashion.  She was hedged round with a great peace, the peace of one who\nhas attained a desired end with much effort and perseverance, and who has\nfound it still eminently desirable in its attainment.  The Duke of Syria\nhad consented to come beneath her roof as a guest, was even now installed\nbeneath her roof, and would shortly be sitting at her dining-table.  As a\ngood Socialist, Sophie disapproved of social distinctions, and derided\nthe idea of a princely caste, but if there were to be these artificial\ngradations of rank and dignity she was pleased and anxious to have an\nexalted specimen of an exalted order included in her house-party.  She\nwas broad-minded enough to love the sinner while hating the sin—not that\nshe entertained any warm feeling of personal affection for the Duke of\nSyria, who was a comparative stranger, but still, as Duke of Syria, he\nwas very, very welcome beneath her roof.  She could not have explained\nwhy, but no one was likely to ask her for an explanation, and most\nhostesses envied her.\n\n“You must surpass yourself to-night, Richardson,” she said complacently\nto her maid; “I must be looking my very best.  We must all surpass\nourselves.”\n\nThe maid said nothing, but from the concentrated look in her eyes and the\ndeft play of her fingers it was evident that she was beset with the\nambition to surpass herself.\n\nA knock came at the door, a quiet but peremptory knock, as of some one\nwho would not be denied.\n\n“Go and see who it is,” said Sophie; “it may be something about the\nwine.”\n\nRichardson held a hurried conference with an invisible messenger at the\ndoor; when she returned there was noticeable a curious listlessness in\nplace of her hitherto alert manner.\n\n“What is it?” asked Sophie.\n\n“The household servants have ‘downed tools,’ madame,” said Richardson.\n\n“Downed tools!” exclaimed Sophie; “do you mean to say they’ve gone on\nstrike?”\n\n“Yes, madame,” said Richardson, adding the information: “It’s Gaspare\nthat the trouble is about.”\n\n“Gaspare?” said Sophie wanderingly; “the emergency chef!  The omelette\nspecialist!”\n\n“Yes, madame.  Before he became an omelette specialist he was a valet,\nand he was one of the strike-breakers in the great strike at Lord\nGrimford’s two years ago.  As soon as the household staff here learned\nthat you had engaged him they resolved to ‘down tools’ as a protest.\nThey haven’t got any grievance against you personally, but they demand\nthat Gaspare should be immediately dismissed.”\n\n“But,” protested Sophie, “he is the only man in England who understands\nhow to make a Byzantine omelette.  I engaged him specially for the Duke\nof Syria’s visit, and it would be impossible to replace him at short\nnotice.  I should have to send to Paris, and the Duke loves Byzantine\nomelettes.  It was the one thing we talked about coming from the\nstation.”\n\n“He was one of the strike-breakers at Lord Grimford’s,” reiterated\nRichardson.\n\n“This is too awful,” said Sophie; “a strike of servants at a moment like\nthis, with the Duke of Syria staying in the house.  Something must be\ndone immediately.  Quick, finish my hair and I’ll go and see what I can\ndo to bring them round.”\n\n“I can’t finish your hair, madame,” said Richardson quietly, but with\nimmense decision.  “I belong to the union and I can’t do another\nhalf-minute’s work till the strike is settled.  I’m sorry to be\ndisobliging.”\n\n“But this is inhuman!” exclaimed Sophie tragically; “I’ve always been a\nmodel mistress and I’ve refused to employ any but union servants, and\nthis is the result.  I can’t finish my hair myself; I don’t know how to.\nWhat am I to do?  It’s wicked!”\n\n“Wicked is the word,” said Richardson; “I’m a good Conservative and I’ve\nno patience with this Socialist foolery, asking your pardon.  It’s\ntyranny, that’s what it is, all along the line, but I’ve my living to\nmake, same as other people, and I’ve got to belong to the union.  I\ncouldn’t touch another hair-pin without a strike permit, not if you was\nto double my wages.”\n\nThe door burst open and Catherine Malsom raged into the room.\n\n“Here’s a nice affair,” she screamed, “a strike of household servants\nwithout a moment’s warning, and I’m left like this!  I can’t appear in\npublic in this condition.”\n\nAfter a very hasty scrutiny Sophie assured her that she could not.\n\n“Have they all struck?” she asked her maid.\n\n“Not the kitchen staff,” said Richardson, “they belong to a different\nunion.”\n\n“Dinner at least will be assured,” said Sophie, “that is something to be\nthankful for.”\n\n“Dinner!” snorted Catherine, “what on earth is the good of dinner when\nnone of us will be able to appear at it?  Look at your hair—and look at\nme! or rather, don’t.”\n\n“I know it’s difficult to manage without a maid; can’t your husband be\nany help to you?” asked Sophie despairingly.\n\n“Henry?  He’s in worse case than any of us.  His man is the only person\nwho really understands that ridiculous new-fangled Turkish bath that he\ninsists on taking with him everywhere.”\n\n“Surely he could do without a Turkish bath for one evening,” said Sophie;\n“I can’t appear without hair, but a Turkish bath is a luxury.”\n\n“My good woman,” said Catherine, speaking with a fearful intensity,\n“Henry was in the bath when the strike started.  In it, do you\nunderstand?  He’s there now.”\n\n“Can’t he get out?”\n\n“He doesn’t know how to.  Every time he pulls the lever marked ‘release’\nhe only releases hot steam.  There are two kinds of steam in the bath,\n‘bearable’ and ‘scarcely bearable’; he has released them both.  By this\ntime I’m probably a widow.”\n\n“I simply can’t send away Gaspare,” wailed Sophie; “I should never be\nable to secure another omelette specialist.”\n\n“Any difficulty that I may experience in securing another husband is of\ncourse a trifle beneath anyone’s consideration,” said Catherine bitterly.\n\nSophie capitulated.  “Go,” she said to Richardson, “and tell the Strike\nCommittee, or whoever are directing this affair, that Gaspare is herewith\ndismissed.  And ask Gaspare to see me presently in the library, when I\nwill pay him what is due to him and make what excuses I can; and then fly\nback and finish my hair.”\n\nSome half an hour later Sophie marshalled her guests in the Grand Salon\npreparatory to the formal march to the dining-room.  Except that Henry\nMalsom was of the ripe raspberry tint that one sometimes sees at private\ntheatricals representing the human complexion, there was little outward\nsign among those assembled of the crisis that had just been encountered\nand surmounted.  But the tension had been too stupefying while it lasted\nnot to leave some mental effects behind it.  Sophie talked at random to\nher illustrious guest, and found her eyes straying with increasing\nfrequency towards the great doors through which would presently come the\nblessed announcement that dinner was served.  Now and again she glanced\nmirror-ward at the reflection of her wonderfully coiffed hair, as an\ninsurance underwriter might gaze thankfully at an overdue vessel that had\nridden safely into harbour in the wake of a devastating hurricane.  Then\nthe doors opened and the welcome figure of the butler entered the room.\nBut he made no general announcement of a banquet in readiness, and the\ndoors closed behind him; his message was for Sophie alone.\n\n“There is no dinner, madame,” he said gravely; “the kitchen staff have\n‘downed tools.’  Gaspare belongs to the Union of Cooks and Kitchen\nEmployees, and as soon as they heard of his summary dismissal at a\nmoment’s notice they struck work.  They demand his instant reinstatement\nand an apology to the union.  I may add, madame, that they are very firm;\nI’ve been obliged even to hand back the dinner rolls that were already on\nthe table.”\n\nAfter the lapse of eighteen months Sophie Chattel-Monkheim is beginning\nto go about again among her old haunts and associates, but she still has\nto be very careful.  The doctors will not let her attend anything at all\nexciting, such as a drawing-room meeting or a Fabian conference; it is\ndoubtful, indeed, whether she wants to.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FEAST OF NEMESIS\n\n\n“It’s a good thing that Saint Valentine’s Day has dropped out of vogue,”\nsaid Mrs. Thackenbury; “what with Christmas and New Year and Easter, not\nto speak of birthdays, there are quite enough remembrance days as it is.\nI tried to save myself trouble at Christmas by just sending flowers to\nall my friends, but it wouldn’t work; Gertrude has eleven hot-houses and\nabout thirty gardeners, so it would have been ridiculous to send flowers\nto her, and Milly has just started a florist’s shop, so it was equally\nout of the question there.  The stress of having to decide in a hurry\nwhat to give to Gertrude and Milly just when I thought I’d got the whole\nquestion nicely off my mind completely ruined my Christmas, and then the\nawful monotony of the letters of thanks: ‘Thank you so much for your\nlovely flowers.  It was so good of you to think of me.’  Of course in the\nmajority of cases I hadn’t thought about the recipients at all; their\nnames were down in my list of ‘people who must not be left out.’  If I\ntrusted to remembering them there would be some awful sins of omission.”\n\n“The trouble is,” said Clovis to his aunt, “all these days of intrusive\nremembrance harp so persistently on one aspect of human nature and\nentirely ignore the other; that is why they become so perfunctory and\nartificial.  At Christmas and New Year you are emboldened and encouraged\nby convention to send gushing messages of optimistic goodwill and servile\naffection to people whom you would scarcely ask to lunch unless some one\nelse had failed you at the last moment; if you are supping at a\nrestaurant on New Year’s Eve you are permitted and expected to join hands\nand sing ‘For Auld Lang Syne’ with strangers whom you have never seen\nbefore and never want to see again.  But no licence is allowed in the\nopposite direction.”\n\n“Opposite direction; what opposite direction?” queried Mrs. Thackenbury.\n\n“There is no outlet for demonstrating your feelings towards people whom\nyou simply loathe.  That is really the crying need of our modern\ncivilisation.  Just think how jolly it would be if a recognised day were\nset apart for the paying off of old scores and grudges, a day when one\ncould lay oneself out to be gracefully vindictive to a carefully\ntreasured list of ‘people who must not be let off.’  I remember when I\nwas at a private school we had one day, the last Monday of the term I\nthink it was, consecrated to the settlement of feuds and grudges; of\ncourse we did not appreciate it as much as it deserved, because, after\nall, any day of the term could be used for that purpose.  Still, if one\nhad chastised a smaller boy for being cheeky weeks before, one was always\npermitted on that day to recall the episode to his memory by chastising\nhim again.  That is what the French call reconstructing the crime.”\n\n“I should call it reconstructing the punishment,” said Mrs. Thackenbury;\n“and, anyhow, I don’t see how you could introduce a system of primitive\nschoolboy vengeance into civilised adult life.  We haven’t outgrown our\npassions, but we are supposed to have learned how to keep them within\nstrictly decorous limits.”\n\n“Of course the thing would have to be done furtively and politely,” said\nClovis; “the charm of it would be that it would never be perfunctory like\nthe other thing.  Now, for instance, you say to yourself: ‘I must show\nthe Webleys some attention at Christmas, they were kind to dear Bertie at\nBournemouth,’ and you send them a calendar, and daily for six days after\nChristmas the male Webley asks the female Webley if she has remembered to\nthank you for the calendar you sent them.  Well, transplant that idea to\nthe other and more human side of your nature, and say to yourself: ‘Next\nThursday is Nemesis Day; what on earth can I do to those odious people\nnext door who made such an absurd fuss when Ping Yang bit their youngest\nchild?’  Then you’d get up awfully early on the allotted day and climb\nover into their garden and dig for truffles on their tennis court with a\ngood gardening fork, choosing, of course, that part of the court that was\nscreened from observation by the laurel bushes.  You wouldn’t find any\ntruffles but you would find a great peace, such as no amount of\npresent-giving could ever bestow.”\n\n“I shouldn’t,” said Mrs. Thackenbury, though her air of protest sounded a\nbit forced; “I should feel rather a worm for doing such a thing.”\n\n“You exaggerate the power of upheaval which a worm would be able to bring\ninto play in the limited time available,” said Clovis; “if you put in a\nstrenuous ten minutes with a really useful fork, the result ought to\nsuggest the operations of an unusually masterful mole or a badger in a\nhurry.”\n\n“They might guess I had done it,” said Mrs. Thackenbury.\n\n“Of course they would,” said Clovis; “that would be half the satisfaction\nof the thing, just as you like people at Christmas to know what presents\nor cards you’ve sent them.  The thing would be much easier to manage, of\ncourse, when you were on outwardly friendly terms with the object of your\ndislike.  That greedy little Agnes Blaik, for instance, who thinks of\nnothing but her food, it would be quite simple to ask her to a picnic in\nsome wild woodland spot and lose her just before lunch was served; when\nyou found her again every morsel of food could have been eaten up.”\n\n“It would require no ordinary human strategy to lose Agnes Blaik when\nluncheon was imminent: in fact, I don’t believe it could be done.”\n\n“Then have all the other guests, people whom you dislike, and lose the\nluncheon.  It could have been sent by accident in the wrong direction.”\n\n“It would be a ghastly picnic,” said Mrs. Thackenbury.\n\n“For them, but not for you,” said Clovis; “you would have had an early\nand comforting lunch before you started, and you could improve the\noccasion by mentioning in detail the items of the missing banquet—the\nlobster Newburg and the egg mayonnaise, and the curry that was to have\nbeen heated in a chafing-dish.  Agnes Blaik would be delirious long\nbefore you got to the list of wines, and in the long interval of waiting,\nbefore they had quite abandoned hope of the lunch turning up, you could\ninduce them to play silly games, such as that idiotic one of ‘the Lord\nMayor’s dinner-party,’ in which every one has to choose the name of a\ndish and do something futile when it is called out.  In this case they\nwould probably burst into tears when their dish is mentioned.  It would\nbe a heavenly picnic.”\n\nMrs. Thackenbury was silent for a moment; she was probably making a\nmental list of the people she would like to invite to the Duke Humphrey\npicnic.  Presently she asked: “And that odious young man, Waldo Plubley,\nwho is always coddling himself—have you thought of anything that one\ncould do to him?”  Evidently she was beginning to see the possibilities\nof Nemesis Day.\n\n“If there was anything like a general observance of the festival,” said\nClovis, “Waldo would be in such demand that you would have to bespeak him\nweeks beforehand, and even then, if there were an east wind blowing or a\ncloud or two in the sky he might be too careful of his precious self to\ncome out.  It would be rather jolly if you could lure him into a hammock\nin the orchard, just near the spot where there is a wasps’ nest every\nsummer.  A comfortable hammock on a warm afternoon would appeal to his\nindolent tastes, and then, when he was getting drowsy, a lighted fusee\nthrown into the nest would bring the wasps out in an indignant mass, and\nthey would soon find a ‘home away from home’ on Waldo’s fat body.  It\ntakes some doing to get out of a hammock in a hurry.”\n\n“They might sting him to death,” protested Mrs. Thackenbury.\n\n“Waldo is one of those people who would be enormously improved by death,”\nsaid Clovis; “but if you didn’t want to go as far as that, you could have\nsome wet straw ready to hand, and set it alight under the hammock at the\nsame time that the fusee was thrown into the nest; the smoke would keep\nall but the most militant of the wasps just outside the stinging line,\nand as long as Waldo remained within its protection he would escape\nserious damage, and could be eventually restored to his mother, kippered\nall over and swollen in places, but still perfectly recognisable.”\n\n“His mother would be my enemy for life,” said Mrs. Thackenbury.\n\n“That would be one greeting less to exchange at Christmas,” said Clovis.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DREAMER\n\n\nIt was the season of sales.  The august establishment of Walpurgis and\nNettlepink had lowered its prices for an entire week as a concession to\ntrade observances, much as an Arch-duchess might protestingly contract an\nattack of influenza for the unsatisfactory reason that influenza was\nlocally prevalent.  Adela Chemping, who considered herself in some\nmeasure superior to the allurements of an ordinary bargain sale, made a\npoint of attending the reduction week at Walpurgis and Nettlepink’s.\n\n“I’m not a bargain hunter,” she said, “but I like to go where bargains\nare.”\n\nWhich showed that beneath her surface strength of character there flowed\na gracious undercurrent of human weakness.\n\nWith a view to providing herself with a male escort Mrs. Chemping had\ninvited her youngest nephew to accompany her on the first day of the\nshopping expedition, throwing in the additional allurement of a\ncinematograph theatre and the prospect of light refreshment.  As Cyprian\nwas not yet eighteen she hoped he might not have reached that stage in\nmasculine development when parcel-carrying is looked on as a thing\nabhorrent.\n\n“Meet me just outside the floral department,” she wrote to him, “and\ndon’t be a moment later than eleven.”\n\nCyprian was a boy who carried with him through early life the wondering\nlook of a dreamer, the eyes of one who sees things that are not visible\nto ordinary mortals, and invests the commonplace things of this world\nwith qualities unsuspected by plainer folk—the eyes of a poet or a house\nagent.  He was quietly dressed—that sartorial quietude which frequently\naccompanies early adolescence, and is usually attributed by novel-writers\nto the influence of a widowed mother.  His hair was brushed back in a\nsmoothness as of ribbon seaweed and seamed with a narrow furrow that\nscarcely aimed at being a parting.  His aunt particularly noted this item\nof his toilet when they met at the appointed rendezvous, because he was\nstanding waiting for her bareheaded.\n\n“Where is your hat?” she asked.\n\n“I didn’t bring one with me,” he replied.\n\nAdela Chemping was slightly scandalised.\n\n“You are not going to be what they call a Nut, are you?” she inquired\nwith some anxiety, partly with the idea that a Nut would be an\nextravagance which her sister’s small household would scarcely be\njustified in incurring, partly, perhaps, with the instinctive\napprehension that a Nut, even in its embryo stage, would refuse to carry\nparcels.\n\nCyprian looked at her with his wondering, dreamy eyes.\n\n“I didn’t bring a hat,” he said, “because it is such a nuisance when one\nis shopping; I mean it is so awkward if one meets anyone one knows and\nhas to take one’s hat off when one’s hands are full of parcels.  If one\nhasn’t got a hat on one can’t take it off.”\n\nMrs. Chemping sighed with great relief; her worst fear had been laid at\nrest.\n\n“It is more orthodox to wear a hat,” she observed, and then turned her\nattention briskly to the business in hand.\n\n“We will go first to the table-linen counter,” she said, leading the way\nin that direction; “I should like to look at some napkins.”\n\nThe wondering look deepened in Cyprian’s eyes as he followed his aunt; he\nbelonged to a generation that is supposed to be over-fond of the rôle of\nmere spectator, but looking at napkins that one did not mean to buy was a\npleasure beyond his comprehension.  Mrs. Chemping held one or two napkins\nup to the light and stared fixedly at them, as though she half expected\nto find some revolutionary cypher written on them in scarcely visible\nink; then she suddenly broke away in the direction of the glassware\ndepartment.\n\n“Millicent asked me to get her a couple of decanters if there were any\ngoing really cheap,” she explained on the way, “and I really do want a\nsalad bowl.  I can come back to the napkins later on.”\n\nShe handled and scrutinised a large number of decanters and a long series\nof salad bowls, and finally bought seven chrysanthemum vases.\n\n“No one uses that kind of vase nowadays,” she informed Cyprian, “but they\nwill do for presents next Christmas.”\n\nTwo sunshades that were marked down to a price that Mrs. Chemping\nconsidered absurdly cheap were added to her purchases.\n\n“One of them will do for Ruth Colson; she is going out to the Malay\nStates, and a sunshade will always be useful there.  And I must get her\nsome thin writing paper.  It takes up no room in one’s baggage.”\n\nMrs. Chemping bought stacks of writing paper; it was so cheap, and it\nwent so flat in a trunk or portmanteau.  She also bought a few\nenvelopes—envelopes somehow seemed rather an extragavance compared with\nnotepaper.\n\n“Do you think Ruth will like blue or grey paper?” she asked Cyprian.\n\n“Grey,” said Cyprian, who had never met the lady in question.\n\n“Have you any mauve notepaper of this quality?” Adela asked the\nassistant.\n\n“We haven’t any mauve,” said the assistant, “but we’ve two shades of\ngreen and a darker shade of grey.”\n\nMrs. Chemping inspected the greens and the darker grey, and chose the\nblue.\n\n“Now we can have some lunch,” she said.\n\nCyprian behaved in an exemplary fashion in the refreshment department,\nand cheerfully accepted a fish cake and a mince pie and a small cup of\ncoffee as adequate restoratives after two hours of concentrated shopping.\nHe was adamant, however, in resisting his aunt’s suggestion that a hat\nshould be bought for him at the counter where men’s headwear was being\ndisposed of at temptingly reduced prices.\n\n“I’ve got as many hats as I want at home,” he said, “and besides, it\nrumples one’s hair so, trying them on.”\n\nPerhaps he was going to develop into a Nut after all.  It was a\ndisquieting symptom that he left all the parcels in charge of the\ncloak-room attendant.\n\n“We shall be getting more parcels presently,” he said, “so we need not\ncollect these till we have finished our shopping.”\n\nHis aunt was doubtfully appeased; some of the pleasure and excitement of\na shopping expedition seemed to evaporate when one was deprived of\nimmediate personal contact with one’s purchases.\n\n“I’m going to look at those napkins again,” she said, as they descended\nthe stairs to the ground floor.  “You need not come,” she added, as the\ndreaming look in the boy’s eyes changed for a moment into one of mute\nprotest, “you can meet me afterwards in the cutlery department; I’ve just\nremembered that I haven’t a corkscrew in the house that can be depended\non.”\n\nCyprian was not to be found in the cutlery department when his aunt in\ndue course arrived there, but in the crush and bustle of anxious shoppers\nand busy attendants it was an easy matter to miss anyone.  It was in the\nleather goods department some quarter of an hour later that Adela\nChemping caught sight of her nephew, separated from her by a rampart of\nsuit-cases and portmanteaux and hemmed in by the jostling crush of human\nbeings that now invaded every corner of the great shopping emporium.  She\nwas just in time to witness a pardonable but rather embarrassing mistake\non the part of a lady who had wriggled her way with unstayable\ndetermination towards the bareheaded Cyprian, and was now breathlessly\ndemanding the sale price of a handbag which had taken her fancy.\n\n“There now,” exclaimed Adela to herself, “she takes him for one of the\nshop assistants because he hasn’t got a hat on.  I wonder it hasn’t\nhappened before.”\n\nPerhaps it had.  Cyprian, at any rate, seemed neither startled nor\nembarrassed by the error into which the good lady had fallen.  Examining\nthe ticket on the bag, he announced in a clear, dispassionate voice:\n\n“Black seal, thirty-four shillings, marked down to twenty-eight.  As a\nmatter of fact, we are clearing them out at a special reduction price of\ntwenty-six shillings.  They are going off rather fast.”\n\n“I’ll take it,” said the lady, eagerly digging some coins out of her\npurse.\n\n“Will you take it as it is?” asked Cyprian; “it will be a matter of a few\nminutes to get it wrapped up, there is such a crush.”\n\n“Never mind, I’ll take it as it is,” said the purchaser, clutching her\ntreasure and counting the money into Cyprian’s palm.\n\nSeveral kind strangers helped Adela into the open air.\n\n“It’s the crush and the heat,” said one sympathiser to another; “it’s\nenough to turn anyone giddy.”\n\nWhen she next came across Cyprian he was standing in the crowd that\npushed and jostled around the counters of the book department.  The dream\nlook was deeper than ever in his eyes.  He had just sold two books of\ndevotion to an elderly Canon.\n\n\n\n\nTHE QUINCE TREE\n\n\n“I’ve just been to see old Betsy Mullen,” announced Vera to her aunt,\nMrs. Bebberly Cumble; “she seems in rather a bad way about her rent.  She\nowes about fifteen weeks of it, and says she doesn’t know where any of it\nis to come from.”\n\n“Betsy Mullen always is in difficulties with her rent, and the more\npeople help her with it the less she troubles about it,” said the aunt.\n“I certainly am not going to assist her any more.  The fact is, she will\nhave to go into a smaller and cheaper cottage; there are several to be\nhad at the other end of the village for half the rent that she is paying,\nor supposed to be paying, now.  I told her a year ago that she ought to\nmove.”\n\n“But she wouldn’t get such a nice garden anywhere else,” protested Vera,\n“and there’s such a jolly quince tree in the corner.  I don’t suppose\nthere’s another quince tree in the whole parish.  And she never makes any\nquince jam; I think to have a quince tree and not to make quince jam\nshows such strength of character.  Oh, she can’t possibly move away from\nthat garden.”\n\n“When one is sixteen,” said Mrs. Bebberly Cumble severely, “one talks of\nthings being impossible which are merely uncongenial.  It is not only\npossible but it is desirable that Betsy Mullen should move into smaller\nquarters; she has scarcely enough furniture to fill that big cottage.”\n\n“As far as value goes,” said Vera after a short pause, “there is more in\nBetsy’s cottage than in any other house for miles round.”\n\n“Nonsense,” said the aunt; “she parted with whatever old china ware she\nhad long ago.”\n\n“I’m not talking about anything that belongs to Betsy herself,” said Vera\ndarkly; “but, of course, you don’t know what I know, and I don’t suppose\nI ought to tell you.”\n\n“You must tell me at once,” exclaimed the aunt, her senses leaping into\nalertness like those of a terrier suddenly exchanging a bored drowsiness\nfor the lively anticipation of an immediate rat hunt.\n\n“I’m perfectly certain that I oughtn’t to tell you anything about it,”\nsaid Vera, “but, then, I often do things that I oughtn’t to do.”\n\n“I should be the last person to suggest that you should do anything that\nyou ought not to do to—” began Mrs. Bebberly Cumble impressively.\n\n“And I am always swayed by the last person who speaks to me,” admitted\nVera, “so I’ll do what I ought not to do and tell you.”\n\nMrs. Bebberley Cumble thrust a very pardonable sense of exasperation into\nthe background of her mind and demanded impatiently:\n\n“What is there in Betsy Mullen’s cottage that you are making such a fuss\nabout?”\n\n“It’s hardly fair to say that _I’ve_ made a fuss about it,” said Vera;\n“this is the first time I’ve mentioned the matter, but there’s been no\nend of trouble and mystery and newspaper speculation about it.  It’s\nrather amusing to think of the columns of conjecture in the Press and the\npolice and detectives hunting about everywhere at home and abroad, and\nall the while that innocent-looking little cottage has held the secret.”\n\n“You don’t mean to say it’s the Louvre picture, La Something or other,\nthe woman with the smile, that disappeared about two years ago?”\nexclaimed the aunt with rising excitement.\n\n“Oh no, not that,” said Vera, “but something quite as important and just\nas mysterious—if anything, rather more scandalous.”\n\n“Not the Dublin—?”\n\nVera nodded.\n\n“The whole jolly lot of them.”\n\n“In Betsy’s cottage?  Incredible!”\n\n“Of course Betsy hasn’t an idea as to what they are,” said Vera; “she\njust knows that they are something valuable and that she must keep quiet\nabout them.  I found out quite by accident what they were and how they\ncame to be there.  You see, the people who had them were at their wits’\nend to know where to stow them away for safe keeping, and some one who\nwas motoring through the village was struck by the snug loneliness of the\ncottage and thought it would be just the thing.  Mrs. Lamper arranged the\nmatter with Betsy and smuggled the things in.”\n\n“Mrs. Lamper?”\n\n“Yes; she does a lot of district visiting, you know.”\n\n“I am quite aware that she takes soup and flannel and improving\nliterature to the poorer cottagers,” said Mrs. Bebberly Cumble, “but that\nis hardly the same sort of thing as disposing of stolen goods, and she\nmust have known something about their history; anyone who reads the\npapers, even casually, must have been aware of the theft, and I should\nthink the things were not hard to recognise.  Mrs. Lamper has always had\nthe reputation of being a very conscientious woman.”\n\n“Of course she was screening some one else,” said Vera.  “A remarkable\nfeature of the affair is the extraordinary number of quite respectable\npeople who have involved themselves in its meshes by trying to shield\nothers.  You would be really astonished if you knew some of the names of\nthe individuals mixed up in it, and I don’t suppose a tithe of them know\nwho the original culprits were; and now I’ve got you entangled in the\nmess by letting you into the secret of the cottage.”\n\n“You most certainly have not entangled me,” said Mrs. Bebberly Cumble\nindignantly.  “I have no intention of shielding anybody.  The police must\nknow about it at once; a theft is a theft, whoever is involved.  If\nrespectable people choose to turn themselves into receivers and disposers\nof stolen goods, well, they’ve ceased to be respectable, that’s all.  I\nshall telephone immediately—”\n\n“Oh, aunt,” said Vera reproachfully, “it would break the poor Canon’s\nheart if Cuthbert were to be involved in a scandal of this sort.  You\nknow it would.”\n\n“Cuthbert involved!  How can you say such things when you know how much\nwe all think of him?”\n\n“Of course I know you think a lot of him, and that he’s engaged to marry\nBeatrice, and that it will be a frightfully good match, and that he’s\nyour ideal of what a son-in-law ought to be.  All the same, it was\nCuthbert’s idea to stow the things away in the cottage, and it was his\nmotor that brought them.  He was only doing it to help his friend\nPegginson, you know—the Quaker man, who is always agitating for a smaller\nNavy.  I forget how he got involved in it.  I warned you that there were\nlots of quite respectable people mixed up in it, didn’t I?  That’s what I\nmeant when I said it would be impossible for old Betsy to leave the\ncottage; the things take up a good bit of room, and she couldn’t go\ncarrying them about with her other goods and chattels without attracting\nnotice.  Of course if she were to fall ill and die it would be equally\nunfortunate.  Her mother lived to be over ninety, she tells me, so with\ndue care and an absence of worry she ought to last for another dozen\nyears at least.  By that time perhaps some other arrangements will have\nbeen made for disposing of the wretched things.”\n\n“I shall speak to Cuthbert about it—after the wedding,” said Mrs.\nBebberly Cumble.\n\n“The wedding isn’t till next year,” said Vera, in recounting the story to\nher best girl friend, “and meanwhile old Betsy is living rent free, with\nsoup twice a week and my aunt’s doctor to see her whenever she has a\nfinger ache.”\n\n“But how on earth did you get to know about it all?” asked her friend, in\nadmiring wonder.\n\n“It was a mystery—” said Vera.\n\n“Of course it was a mystery, a mystery that baffled everybody.  What\nbeats me is how you found out—”\n\n“Oh, about the jewels?  I invented that part,” explained Vera; “I mean\nthe mystery was where old Betsy’s arrears of rent were to come from; and\nshe would have hated leaving that jolly quince tree.”\n\n\n\n\nTHE FORBIDDEN BUZZARDS\n\n\n“Is matchmaking at all in your line?”\n\nHugo Peterby asked the question with a certain amount of personal\ninterest.\n\n“I don’t specialise in it,” said Clovis; “it’s all right while you’re\ndoing it, but the after-effects are sometimes so disconcerting—the mute\nreproachful looks of the people you’ve aided and abetted in matrimonial\nexperiments.  It’s as bad as selling a man a horse with half a dozen\nlatent vices and watching him discover them piecemeal in the course of\nthe hunting season.  I suppose you’re thinking of the Coulterneb girl.\nShe’s certainly jolly, and quite all right as far as looks go, and I\nbelieve a certain amount of money adheres to her.  What I don’t see is\nhow you will ever manage to propose to her.  In all the time I’ve known\nher I don’t remember her to have stopped talking for three consecutive\nminutes.  You’ll have to race her six times round the grass paddock for a\nbet, and then blurt your proposal out before she’s got her wind back.\nThe paddock is laid up for hay, but if you’re really in love with her you\nwon’t let a consideration of that sort stop you, especially as it’s not\nyour hay.”\n\n“I think I could manage the proposing part right enough,” said Hugo, “if\nI could count on being left alone with her for four or five hours.  The\ntrouble is that I’m not likely to get anything like that amount of grace.\nThat fellow Lanner is showing signs of interesting himself in the same\nquarter.  He’s quite heartbreakingly rich and is rather a swell in his\nway; in fact, our hostess is obviously a bit flattered at having him\nhere.  If she gets wind of the fact that he’s inclined to be attracted by\nBetty Coulterneb she’ll think it a splendid match and throw them into\neach other’s arms all day long, and then where will my opportunities come\nin?  My one anxiety is to keep him out of the girl’s way as much as\npossible, and if you could help me—”\n\n“If you want me to trot Lanner round the countryside, inspecting alleged\nRoman remains and studying local methods of bee culture and crop raising,\nI’m afraid I can’t oblige you,” said Clovis.  “You see, he’s taken\nsomething like an aversion to me since the other night in the\nsmoking-room.”\n\n“What happened in the smoking-room?”\n\n“He trotted out some well-worn chestnut as the latest thing in good\nstories, and I remarked, quite innocently, that I never could remember\nwhether it was George II. or James II. who was so fond of that particular\nstory, and now he regards me with politely-draped dislike.  I’ll do my\nbest for you, if the opportunity arises, but it will have to be in a\nroundabout, impersonal manner.”\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n“It’s so nice having Mr. Lanner here,” confided Mrs. Olston to Clovis the\nnext afternoon; “he’s always been engaged when I’ve asked him before.\nSuch a nice man; he really ought to be married to some nice girl.\nBetween you and me, I have an idea that he came down here for a certain\nreason.”\n\n“I’ve had much the same idea,” said Clovis, lowering his voice; “in fact,\nI’m almost certain of it.”\n\n“You mean he’s attracted by—” began Mrs. Olston eagerly.\n\n“I mean he’s here for what he can get,” said Clovis.\n\n“For what he can _get_?” said the hostess with a touch of indignation in\nher voice; “what do you mean?  He’s a very rich man.  What should he want\nto get here?”\n\n“He has one ruling passion,” said Clovis, “and there’s something he can\nget here that is not to be had for love nor for money anywhere else in\nthe country, as far as I know.”\n\n“But what?  Whatever do you mean?  What is his ruling passion?”\n\n“Egg-collecting,” said Clovis.  “He has agents all over the world getting\nrare eggs for him, and his collection is one of the finest in Europe; but\nhis great ambition is to collect his treasures personally.  He stops at\nno expense nor trouble to achieve that end.”\n\n“Good heavens!  The buzzards, the rough-legged buzzards!” exclaimed Mrs.\nOlston; “you don’t think he’s going to raid their nest?”\n\n“What do you think yourself?” asked Clovis; “the only pair of\nrough-legged buzzards known to breed in this country are nesting in your\nwoods.  Very few people know about them, but as a member of the league\nfor protecting rare birds that information would be at his disposal.  I\ncame down in the train with him, and I noticed that a bulky volume of\nDresser’s ‘Birds of Europe’ was one of the requisites that he had packed\nin his travelling-kit.  It was the volume dealing with short-winged hawks\nand buzzards.”\n\nClovis believed that if a lie was worth telling it was worth telling\nwell.\n\n“This is appalling,” said Mrs. Olston; “my husband would never forgive me\nif anything happened to those birds.  They’ve been seen about the woods\nfor the last year or two, but this is the first time they’ve nested.  As\nyou say, they are almost the only pair known to be breeding in the whole\nof Great Britain; and now their nest is going to be harried by a guest\nstaying under my roof.  I must do something to stop it.  Do you think if\nI appealed to him—”\n\nClovis laughed.\n\n“There is a story going about, which I fancy is true in most of its\ndetails, of something that happened not long ago somewhere on the coast\nof the Sea of Marmora, in which our friend had a hand.  A Syrian\nnightjar, or some such bird, was known to be breeding in the olive\ngardens of a rich Armenian, who for some reason or other wouldn’t allow\nLanner to go in and take the eggs, though he offered cash down for the\npermission.  The Armenian was found beaten nearly to death a day or two\nlater, and his fences levelled.  It was assumed to be a case of Mussulman\naggression, and noted as such in all the Consular reports, but the eggs\nare in the Lanner collection.  No, I don’t think I should appeal to his\nbetter feelings if I were you.”\n\n“I must do something,” said Mrs. Olston tearfully; “my husband’s parting\nwords when he went off to Norway were an injunction to see that those\nbirds were not disturbed, and he’s asked about them every time he’s\nwritten.  Do suggest something.”\n\n“I was going to suggest picketing,” said Clovis.\n\n“Picketing!  You mean setting guards round the birds?”\n\n“No; round Lanner.  He can’t find his way through those woods by night,\nand you could arrange that you or Evelyn or Jack or the German governess\nshould be by his side in relays all day long.  A fellow guest he could\nget rid of, but he couldn’t very well shake off members of the household,\nand even the most determined collector would hardly go climbing after\nforbidden buzzards’ eggs with a German governess hanging round his neck,\nso to speak.”\n\nLanner, who had been lazily watching for an opportunity for prosecuting\nhis courtship of the Coulterneb girl, found presently that his chances of\ngetting her to himself for ten minutes even were non-existent.  If the\ngirl was ever alone he never was.  His hostess had changed suddenly, as\nfar as he was concerned, from the desirable type that lets her guests do\nnothing in the way that best pleases them, to the sort that drags them\nover the ground like so many harrows.  She showed him the herb garden and\nthe greenhouses, the village church, some water-colour sketches that her\nsister had done in Corsica, and the place where it was hoped that celery\nwould grow later in the year.\n\nHe was shown all the Aylesbury ducklings and the row of wooden hives\nwhere there would have been bees if there had not been bee disease.  He\nwas also taken to the end of a long lane and shown a distant mound\nwhereon local tradition reported that the Danes had once pitched a camp.\nAnd when his hostess had to desert him temporarily for other duties he\nwould find Evelyn walking solemnly by his side.  Evelyn was fourteen and\ntalked chiefly about good and evil, and of how much one might accomplish\nin the way of regenerating the world if one was thoroughly determined to\ndo one’s utmost.  It was generally rather a relief when she was displaced\nby Jack, who was nine years old, and talked exclusively about the Balkan\nWar without throwing any fresh light on its political or military\nhistory.  The German governess told Lanner more about Schiller than he\nhad ever heard in his life about any one person; it was perhaps his own\nfault for having told her that he was not interested in Goethe.  When the\ngoverness went off picket duty the hostess was again on hand with a\nnot-to-be-gainsaid invitation to visit the cottage of an old woman who\nremembered Charles James Fox; the woman had been dead for two or three\nyears, but the cottage was still there.  Lanner was called back to town\nearlier than he had originally intended.\n\nHugo did not bring off his affair with Betty Coulterneb.  Whether she\nrefused him or whether, as was more generally supposed, he did not get a\nchance of saying three consecutive words, has never been exactly\nascertained.  Anyhow, she is still the jolly Coulterneb girl.\n\nThe buzzards successfully reared two young ones, which were shot by a\nlocal hairdresser.\n\n\n\n\nTHE STAKE\n\n\n“Ronnie is a great trial to me,” said Mrs. Attray plaintively.  “Only\neighteen years old last February and already a confirmed gambler.  I am\nsure I don’t know where he inherits it from; his father never touched\ncards, and you know how little I play—a game of bridge on Wednesday\nafternoons in the winter, for three-pence a hundred, and even that I\nshouldn’t do if it wasn’t that Edith always wants a fourth and would be\ncertain to ask that detestable Jenkinham woman if she couldn’t get me.  I\nwould much rather sit and talk any day than play bridge; cards are such a\nwaste of time, I think.  But as to Ronnie, bridge and baccarat and\npoker-patience are positively all that he thinks about.  Of course I’ve\ndone my best to stop it; I’ve asked the Norridrums not to let him play\ncards when he’s over there, but you might as well ask the Atlantic Ocean\nto keep quiet for a crossing as expect them to bother about a mother’s\nnatural anxieties.”\n\n“Why do you let him go there?” asked Eleanor Saxelby.\n\n“My dear,” said Mrs. Attray, “I don’t want to offend them.  After all,\nthey are my landlords and I have to look to them for anything I want done\nabout the place; they were very accommodating about the new roof for the\norchid house.  And they lend me one of their cars when mine is out of\norder; you know how often it gets out of order.”\n\n“I don’t know how often,” said Eleanor, “but it must happen very\nfrequently.  Whenever I want you to take me anywhere in your car I am\nalways told that there is something wrong with it, or else that the\nchauffeur has got neuralgia and you don’t like to ask him to go out.”\n\n“He suffers quite a lot from neuralgia,” said Mrs. Attray hastily.\n“Anyhow,” she continued, “you can understand that I don’t want to offend\nthe Norridrums.  Their household is the most rackety one in the county,\nand I believe no one ever knows to an hour or two when any particular\nmeal will appear on the table or what it will consist of when it does\nappear.”\n\nEleanor Saxelby shuddered.  She liked her meals to be of regular\noccurrence and assured proportions.\n\n“Still,” pursued Mrs. Attray, “whatever their own home life may be, as\nlandlords and neighbours they are considerate and obliging, so I don’t\nwant to quarrel with them.  Besides, if Ronnie didn’t play cards there\nhe’d be playing somewhere else.”\n\n“Not if you were firm with him,” said Eleanor “I believe in being firm.”\n\n“Firm?  I am firm,” exclaimed Mrs. Attray; “I am more than firm—I am\nfarseeing.  I’ve done everything I can think of to prevent Ronnie from\nplaying for money.  I’ve stopped his allowance for the rest of the year,\nso he can’t even gamble on credit, and I’ve subscribed a lump sum to the\nchurch offertory in his name instead of giving him instalments of small\nsilver to put in the bag on Sundays.  I wouldn’t even let him have the\nmoney to tip the hunt servants with, but sent it by postal order.  He was\nfuriously sulky about it, but I reminded him of what happened to the ten\nshillings that I gave him for the Young Men’s Endeavour League\n‘Self-Denial Week.’”\n\n“What did happen to it?” asked Eleanor.\n\n“Well, Ronnie did some preliminary endeavouring with it, on his own\naccount, in connection with the Grand National.  If it had come off, as\nhe expressed it, he would have given the League twenty-five shillings and\nnetted a comfortable commission for himself; as it was, that ten\nshillings was one of the things the League had to deny itself.  Since\nthen I’ve been careful not to let him have a penny piece in his hands.”\n\n“He’ll get round that in some way,” said Eleanor with quiet conviction;\n“he’ll sell things.”\n\n“My dear, he’s done all that is to be done in that direction already.\nHe’s got rid of his wrist-watch and his hunting flask and both his\ncigarette cases, and I shouldn’t be surprised if he’s wearing\nimitation-gold sleeve links instead of those his Aunt Rhoda gave him on\nhis seventeenth birthday.  He can’t sell his clothes, of course, except\nhis winter overcoat, and I’ve locked that up in the camphor cupboard on\nthe pretext of preserving it from moth.  I really don’t see what else he\ncan raise money on.  I consider that I’ve been both firm and farseeing.”\n\n“Has he been at the Norridrums lately?” asked Eleanor.\n\n“He was there yesterday afternoon and stayed to dinner,” said Mrs.\nAttray.  “I don’t quite know when he came home, but I fancy it was late.”\n\n“Then depend on it he was gambling,” said Eleanor, with the assured air\nof one who has few ideas and makes the most of them.  “Late hours in the\ncountry always mean gambling.”\n\n“He can’t gamble if he has no money and no chance of getting any,” argued\nMrs. Attray; “even if one plays for small stakes one must have a decent\nprospect of paying one’s losses.”\n\n“He may have sold some of the Amherst pheasant chicks,” suggested\nEleanor; “they would fetch about ten or twelve shillings each, I\ndaresay.”\n\n“Ronnie wouldn’t do such a thing,” said Mrs. Attray; “and anyhow I went\nand counted them this morning and they’re all there.  No,” she continued,\nwith the quiet satisfaction that comes from a sense of painstaking and\nmerited achievement, “I fancy that Ronnie had to content himself with the\nrôle of onlooker last night, as far as the card-table was concerned.”\n\n“Is that clock right?” asked Eleanor, whose eyes had been straying\nrestlessly towards the mantel-piece for some little time; “lunch is\nusually so punctual in your establishment.”\n\n“Three minutes past the half-hour,” exclaimed Mrs. Attray; “cook must be\npreparing something unusually sumptuous in your honour.  I am not in the\nsecret; I’ve been out all the morning, you know.”\n\nEleanor smiled forgivingly.  A special effort by Mrs. Attray’s cook was\nworth waiting a few minutes for.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the luncheon fare, when it made its tardy\nappearance, was distinctly unworthy of the reputation which the\njustly-treasured cook had built up for herself.  The soup alone would\nhave sufficed to cast a gloom over any meal that it had inaugurated, and\nit was not redeemed by anything that followed.  Eleanor said little, but\nwhen she spoke there was a hint of tears in her voice that was far more\neloquent than outspoken denunciation would have been, and even the\ninsouciant Ronald showed traces of depression when he tasted the rognons\nSaltikoff.\n\n“Not quite the best luncheon I’ve enjoyed in your house,” said Eleanor at\nlast, when her final hope had flickered out with the savoury.\n\n“My dear, it’s the worst meal I’ve sat down to for years,” said her\nhostess; “that last dish tasted principally of red pepper and wet toast.\nI’m awfully sorry.  Is anything the matter in the kitchen, Pellin?” she\nasked of the attendant maid.\n\n“Well, ma’am, the new cook hadn’t hardly time to see to things properly,\ncoming in so sudden—” commenced Pellin by way of explanation.\n\n“The new cook!” screamed Mrs. Attray.\n\n“Colonel Norridrum’s cook, ma’am,” said Pellin.\n\n“What on earth do you mean?  What is Colonel Norridrum’s cook doing in my\nkitchen—and where is my cook?”\n\n“Perhaps I can explain better than Pellin can,” said Ronald hurriedly;\n“the fact is, I was dining at the Norridrums’ yesterday, and they were\nwishing they had a swell cook like yours, just for to-day and to-morrow,\nwhile they’ve got some gourmet staying with them: their own cook is no\nearthly good—well, you’ve seen what she turns out when she’s at all\nflurried.  So I thought it would be rather sporting to play them at\nbaccarat for the loan of our cook against a money stake, and I lost,\nthat’s all.  I have had rotten luck at baccarat all this year.”\n\nThe remainder of his explanation, of how he had assured the cooks that\nthe temporary transfer had his mother’s sanction, and had smuggled the\none out and the other in during the maternal absence, was drowned in the\noutcry of scandalised upbraiding.\n\n“If I had sold the woman into slavery there couldn’t have been a bigger\nfuss about it,” he confided afterwards to Bertie Norridrum, “and Eleanor\nSaxelby raged and ramped the louder of the two.  I tell you what, I’ll\nbet you two of the Amherst pheasants to five shillings that she refuses\nto have me as a partner at the croquet tournament.  We’re drawn together,\nyou know.”\n\nThis time he won his bet.\n\n\n\n\nCLOVIS ON PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n\nMarion Eggelby sat talking to Clovis on the only subject that she ever\nwillingly talked about—her offspring and their varied perfections and\naccomplishments.  Clovis was not in what could be called a receptive\nmood; the younger generation of Eggelby, depicted in the glowing\nimprobable colours of parent impressionism, aroused in him no enthusiasm.\nMrs. Eggelby, on the other hand, was furnished with enthusiasm enough for\ntwo.\n\n“You would like Eric,” she said, argumentatively rather than hopefully.\nClovis had intimated very unmistakably that he was unlikely to care\nextravagantly for either Amy or Willie.  “Yes, I feel sure you would like\nEric.  Every one takes to him at once.  You know, he always reminds me of\nthat famous picture of the youthful David—I forget who it’s by, but it’s\nvery well known.”\n\n“That would be sufficient to set me against him, if I saw much of him,”\nsaid Clovis.  “Just imagine at auction bridge, for instance, when one was\ntrying to concentrate one’s mind on what one’s partner’s original\ndeclaration had been, and to remember what suits one’s opponents had\noriginally discarded, what it would be like to have some one persistently\nreminding one of a picture of the youthful David.  It would be simply\nmaddening.  If Eric did that I should detest him.”\n\n“Eric doesn’t play bridge,” said Mrs. Eggelby with dignity.\n\n“Doesn’t he?” asked Clovis; “why not?”\n\n“None of my children have been brought up to play card games,” said Mrs.\nEggelby; “draughts and halma and those sorts of games I encourage.  Eric\nis considered quite a wonderful draughts-player.”\n\n“You are strewing dreadful risks in the path of your family,” said\nClovis; “a friend of mine who is a prison chaplain told me that among the\nworst criminal cases that have come under his notice, men condemned to\ndeath or to long periods of penal servitude, there was not a single\nbridge-player.  On the other hand, he knew at least two expert\ndraughts-players among them.”\n\n“I really don’t see what my boys have got to do with the criminal\nclasses,” said Mrs. Eggelby resentfully.  “They have been most carefully\nbrought up, I can assure you that.”\n\n“That shows that you were nervous as to how they would turn out,” said\nClovis.  “Now, my mother never bothered about bringing me up.  She just\nsaw to it that I got whacked at decent intervals and was taught the\ndifference between right and wrong; there is some difference, you know,\nbut I’ve forgotten what it is.”\n\n“Forgotten the difference between right and wrong!” exclaimed Mrs.\nEggelby.\n\n“Well, you see, I took up natural history and a whole lot of other\nsubjects at the same time, and one can’t remember everything, can one?  I\nused to know the difference between the Sardinian dormouse and the\nordinary kind, and whether the wry-neck arrives at our shores earlier\nthan the cuckoo, or the other way round, and how long the walrus takes in\ngrowing to maturity; I daresay you knew all those sorts of things once,\nbut I bet you’ve forgotten them.”\n\n“Those things are not important,” said Mrs. Eggelby, “but—”\n\n“The fact that we’ve both forgotten them proves that they are important,”\nsaid Clovis; “you must have noticed that it’s always the important things\nthat one forgets, while the trivial, unnecessary facts of life stick in\none’s memory.  There’s my cousin, Editha Clubberley, for instance; I can\nnever forget that her birthday is on the 12th of October.  It’s a matter\nof utter indifference to me on what date her birthday falls, or whether\nshe was born at all; either fact seems to me absolutely trivial, or\nunnecessary—I’ve heaps of other cousins to go on with.  On the other\nhand, when I’m staying with Hildegarde Shrubley I can never remember the\nimportant circumstance whether her first husband got his unenviable\nreputation on the Turf or the Stock Exchange, and that uncertainty rules\nSport and Finance out of the conversation at once.  One can never mention\ntravel, either, because her second husband had to live permanently\nabroad.”\n\n“Mrs. Shrubley and I move in very different circles,” said Mrs. Eggelby\nstiffly.\n\n“No one who knows Hildegarde could possibly accuse her of moving in a\ncircle,” said Clovis; “her view of life seems to be a non-stop run with\nan inexhaustible supply of petrol.  If she can get some one else to pay\nfor the petrol so much the better.  I don’t mind confessing to you that\nshe has taught me more than any other woman I can think of.”\n\n“What kind of knowledge?” demanded Mrs. Eggelby, with the air a jury\nmight collectively wear when finding a verdict without leaving the box.\n\n“Well, among other things, she’s introduced me to at least four different\nways of cooking lobster,” said Clovis gratefully.  “That, of course,\nwouldn’t appeal to you; people who abstain from the pleasures of the\ncard-table never really appreciate the finer possibilities of the\ndining-table.  I suppose their powers of enlightened enjoyment get\natrophied from disuse.”\n\n“An aunt of mine was very ill after eating a lobster,” said Mrs. Eggelby.\n\n“I daresay, if we knew more of her history, we should find out that she’d\noften been ill before eating the lobster.  Aren’t you concealing the fact\nthat she’d had measles and influenza and nervous headache and hysteria,\nand other things that aunts do have, long before she ate the lobster?\nAunts that have never known a day’s illness are very rare; in fact, I\ndon’t personally know of any.  Of course if she ate it as a child of two\nweeks old it might have been her first illness—and her last.  But if that\nwas the case I think you should have said so.”\n\n“I must be going,” said Mrs. Eggelby, in a tone which had been thoroughly\nsterilised of even perfunctory regret.\n\nClovis rose with an air of graceful reluctance.\n\n“I have so enjoyed our little talk about Eric,” he said; “I quite look\nforward to meeting him some day.”\n\n“Good-bye,” said Mrs. Eggelby frostily; the supplementary remark which\nshe made at the back of her throat was—\n\n“I’ll take care that you never shall!”\n\n\n\n\nA HOLIDAY TASK\n\n\nKenelm Jerton entered the dining-hall of the Golden Galleon Hotel in the\nfull crush of the luncheon hour.  Nearly every seat was occupied, and\nsmall additional tables had been brought in, where floor space permitted,\nto accommodate latecomers, with the result that many of the tables were\nalmost touching each other.  Jerton was beckoned by a waiter to the only\nvacant table that was discernible, and took his seat with the\nuncomfortable and wholly groundless idea that nearly every one in the\nroom was staring at him.  He was a youngish man of ordinary appearance,\nquiet of dress and unobtrusive of manner, and he could never wholly rid\nhimself of the idea that a fierce light of public scrutiny beat on him as\nthough he had been a notability or a super-nut.  After he had ordered his\nlunch there came the unavoidable interval of waiting, with nothing to do\nbut to stare at the flower-vase on his table and to be stared at (in\nimagination) by several flappers, some maturer beings of the same sex,\nand a satirical-looking Jew.  In order to carry off the situation with\nsome appearance of unconcern he became spuriously interested in the\ncontents of the flower-vase.\n\n“What is the name of these roses, d’you know?” he asked the waiter.  The\nwaiter was ready at all times to conceal his ignorance concerning items\nof the wine-list or menu; he was frankly ignorant as to the specific name\nof the roses.\n\n“_Amy Sylvester Partington_,” said a voice at Jerton’s elbow.\n\nThe voice came from a pleasant-faced, well-dressed young woman who was\nsitting at a table that almost touched Jerton’s.  He thanked her\nhurriedly and nervously for the information, and made some inconsequent\nremark about the flowers.\n\n“It is a curious thing,” said the young woman, that, “I should be able to\ntell you the name of those roses without an effort of memory, because if\nyou were to ask me my name I should be utterly unable to give it to you.”\n\nJerton had not harboured the least intention of extending his thirst for\nname-labels to his neighbour.  After her rather remarkable announcement,\nhowever, he was obliged to say something in the way of polite inquiry.\n\n“Yes,” answered the lady, “I suppose it is a case of partial loss of\nmemory.  I was in the train coming down here; my ticket told me that I\nhad come from Victoria and was bound for this place.  I had a couple of\nfive-pound notes and a sovereign on me, no visiting cards or any other\nmeans of identification, and no idea as to who I am.  I can only hazily\nrecollect that I have a title; I am Lady Somebody—beyond that my mind is\na blank.”\n\n“Hadn’t you any luggage with you?” asked Jerton.\n\n“That is what I didn’t know.  I knew the name of this hotel and made up\nmy mind to come here, and when the hotel porter who meets the trains\nasked if I had any luggage I had to invent a dressing-bag and\ndress-basket; I could always pretend that they had gone astray.  I gave\nhim the name of Smith, and presently he emerged from a confused pile of\nluggage and passengers with a dressing-bag and dress-basket labelled\nKestrel-Smith.  I had to take them; I don’t see what else I could have\ndone.”\n\nJerton said nothing, but he rather wondered what the lawful owner of the\nbaggage would do.\n\n“Of course it was dreadful arriving at a strange hotel with the name of\nKestrel-Smith, but it would have been worse to have arrived without\nluggage.  Anyhow, I hate causing trouble.”\n\nJerton had visions of harassed railway officials and distraught\nKestrel-Smiths, but he made no attempt to clothe his mental picture in\nwords.  The lady continued her story.\n\n“Naturally, none of my keys would fit the things, but I told an\nintelligent page boy that I had lost my key-ring, and he had the locks\nforced in a twinkling.  Rather too intelligent, that boy; he will\nprobably end in Dartmoor.  The Kestrel-Smith toilet tools aren’t up to\nmuch, but they are better than nothing.”\n\n“If you feel sure that you have a title,” said Jerton, “why not get hold\nof a peerage and go right through it?”\n\n“I tried that.  I skimmed through the list of the House of Lords in\n‘Whitaker,’ but a mere printed string of names conveys awfully little to\none, you know.  If you were an army officer and had lost your identity\nyou might pore over the Army List for months without finding out who your\nwere.  I’m going on another tack; I’m trying to find out by various\nlittle tests who I am _not_—that will narrow the range of uncertainty\ndown a bit.  You may have noticed, for instance, that I’m lunching\nprincipally off lobster Newburg.”\n\nJerton had not ventured to notice anything of the sort.\n\n“It’s an extravagance, because it’s one of the most expensive dishes on\nthe menu, but at any rate it proves that I’m not Lady Starping; she never\ntouches shell-fish, and poor Lady Braddleshrub has no digestion at all;\nif I am _her_ I shall certainly die in agony in the course of the\nafternoon, and the duty of finding out who I am will devolve on the press\nand the police and those sort of people; I shall be past caring.  Lady\nKnewford doesn’t know one rose from another and she hates men, so she\nwouldn’t have spoken to you in any case; and Lady Mousehilton flirts with\nevery man she meets—I haven’t flirted with you, have I?”\n\nJerton hastily gave the required assurance.\n\n“Well, you see,” continued the lady, “that knocks four off the list at\nonce.”\n\n“It’ll be rather a lengthy process bringing the list down to one,” said\nJerton.\n\n“Oh, but, of course, there are heaps of them that I couldn’t possibly\nbe—women who’ve got grandchildren or sons old enough to have celebrated\ntheir coming of age.  I’ve only got to consider the ones about my own\nage.  I tell you how you might help me this afternoon, if you don’t mind;\ngo through any of the back numbers of _Country Life_ and those sort of\npapers that you can find in the smoking-room, and see if you come across\nmy portrait with infant son or anything of that sort.  It won’t take you\nten minutes.  I’ll meet you in the lounge about tea-time.  Thanks\nawfully.”\n\nAnd the Fair Unknown, having graciously pressed Jerton into the search\nfor her lost identity, rose and left the room.  As she passed the young\nman’s table she halted for a moment and whispered:\n\n“Did you notice that I tipped the waiter a shilling?  We can cross Lady\nUlwight off the list; she would have died rather than do that.”\n\nAt five o’clock Jerton made his way to the hotel lounge; he had spent a\ndiligent but fruitless quarter of an hour among the illustrated weeklies\nin the smoking-room.  His new acquaintance was seated at a small\ntea-table, with a waiter hovering in attendance.\n\n“China tea or Indian?” she asked as Jerton came up.\n\n“China, please, and nothing to eat.  Have you discovered anything?”\n\n“Only negative information.  I’m not Lady Befnal.  She disapproves\ndreadfully of any form of gambling, so when I recognised a well-known\nbook maker in the hotel lobby I went and put a tenner on an unnamed filly\nby William the Third out of Mitrovitza for the three-fifteen race.  I\nsuppose the fact of the animal being nameless was what attracted me.”\n\n“Did it win?” asked Jerton.\n\n“No, came in fourth, the most irritating thing a horse can do when you’ve\nbacked it win or place.  Anyhow, I know now that I’m not Lady Befnal.”\n\n“It seems to me that the knowledge was rather dearly bought,” commented\nJerton.\n\n“Well, yes, it has rather cleared me out,” admitted the identity-seeker;\n“a florin is about all I’ve got left on me.  The lobster Newburg made my\nlunch rather an expensive one, and, of course, I had to tip that boy for\nwhat he did to the Kestrel-Smith locks.  I’ve got rather a useful idea,\nthough.  I feel certain that I belong to the Pivot Club; I’ll go back to\ntown and ask the hall porter there if there are any letters for me.  He\nknows all the members by sight, and if there are any letters or telephone\nmessages waiting for me of course that will solve the problem.  If he\nsays there aren’t any I shall say: ‘You know who I am, don’t you?’ so\nI’ll find out anyway.”\n\nThe plan seemed a sound one; a difficulty in its execution suggested\nitself to Jerton.\n\n“Of course,” said the lady, when he hinted at the obstacle, “there’s my\nfare back to town, and my bill here and cabs and things.  If you’ll lend\nme three pounds that ought to see me through comfortably.  Thanks ever\nso.  Then there is the question of that luggage: I don’t want to be\nsaddled with that for the rest of my life.  I’ll have it brought down to\nthe hall and you can pretend to mount guard over it while I’m writing a\nletter.  Then I shall just slip away to the station, and you can wander\noff to the smoking-room, and they can do what they like with the things.\nThey’ll advertise them after a bit and the owner can claim them.”\n\nJerton acquiesced in the manœuvre, and duly mounted guard over the\nluggage while its temporary owner slipped unobtrusively out of the hotel.\nHer departure was not, however, altogether unnoticed.  Two gentlemen were\nstrolling past Jerton, and one of them remarked to the other:\n\n“Did you see that tall young woman in grey who went out just now?  She is\nthe Lady—”\n\nHis promenade carried him out of earshot at the critical moment when he\nwas about to disclose the elusive identity.  The Lady Who?  Jerton could\nscarcely run after a total stranger, break into his conversation, and ask\nhim for information concerning a chance passer-by.  Besides, it was\ndesirable that he should keep up the appearance of looking after the\nluggage.  In a minute or two, however, the important personage, the man\nwho knew, came strolling back alone.  Jerton summoned up all his courage\nand waylaid him.\n\n“I think I heard you say you knew the lady who went out of the hotel a\nfew minutes ago, a tall lady, dressed in grey.  Excuse me for asking if\nyou could tell me her name; I’ve been talking to her for half an hour;\nshe—er—she knows all my people and seems to know me, so I suppose I’ve\nmet her somewhere before, but I’m blest if I can put a name to her.\nCould you—?”\n\n“Certainly.  She’s a Mrs. Stroope.”\n\n“_Mrs._?” queried Jerton.\n\n“Yes, she’s the Lady Champion at golf in my part of the world.  An awful\ngood sort, and goes about a good deal in Society, but she has an awkward\nhabit of losing her memory every now and then, and gets into all sorts of\nfixes.  She’s furious, too, if you make any allusion to it afterwards.\nGood day, sir.”\n\nThe stranger passed on his way, and before Jerton had had time to\nassimilate his information he found his whole attention centred on an\nangry-looking lady who was making loud and fretful-seeming inquiries of\nthe hotel clerks.\n\n“Has any luggage been brought here from the station by mistake, a\ndress-basket and dressing-case, with the name Kestrel-Smith?  It can’t be\ntraced anywhere.  I saw it put in at Victoria, that I’ll swear.\nWhy—there is my luggage! and the locks have been tampered with!”\n\nJerton heard no more.  He fled down to the Turkish bath, and stayed there\nfor hours.\n\n\n\n\nTHE STALLED OX\n\n\nTheophil Eshley was an artist by profession, a cattle painter by force of\nenvironment.  It is not to be supposed that he lived on a ranche or a\ndairy farm, in an atmosphere pervaded with horn and hoof, milking-stool,\nand branding-iron.  His home was in a park-like, villa-dotted district\nthat only just escaped the reproach of being suburban.  On one side of\nhis garden there abutted a small, picturesque meadow, in which an\nenterprising neighbour pastured some small picturesque cows of the\nChannel Island persuasion.  At noonday in summertime the cows stood\nknee-deep in tall meadow-grass under the shade of a group of walnut\ntrees, with the sunlight falling in dappled patches on their mouse-sleek\ncoats.  Eshley had conceived and executed a dainty picture of two\nreposeful milch-cows in a setting of walnut tree and meadow-grass and\nfiltered sunbeam, and the Royal Academy had duly exposed the same on the\nwalls of its Summer Exhibition.  The Royal Academy encourages orderly,\nmethodical habits in its children.  Eshley had painted a successful and\nacceptable picture of cattle drowsing picturesquely under walnut trees,\nand as he had begun, so, of necessity, he went on.  His “Noontide Peace,”\na study of two dun cows under a walnut tree, was followed by “A Mid-day\nSanctuary,” a study of a walnut tree, with two dun cows under it.  In due\nsuccession there came “Where the Gad-Flies Cease from Troubling,” “The\nHaven of the Herd,” and “A-dream in Dairyland,” studies of walnut trees\nand dun cows.  His two attempts to break away from his own tradition were\nsignal failures: “Turtle Doves alarmed by Sparrow-hawk” and “Wolves on\nthe Roman Campagna” came back to his studio in the guise of abominable\nheresies, and Eshley climbed back into grace and the public gaze with “A\nShaded Nook where Drowsy Milkers Dream.”\n\nOn a fine afternoon in late autumn he was putting some finishing touches\nto a study of meadow weeds when his neighbour, Adela Pingsford, assailed\nthe outer door of his studio with loud peremptory knockings.\n\n“There is an ox in my garden,” she announced, in explanation of the\ntempestuous intrusion.\n\n“An ox,” said Eshley blankly, and rather fatuously; “what kind of ox?”\n\n“Oh, I don’t know what kind,” snapped the lady.  “A common or garden ox,\nto use the slang expression.  It is the garden part of it that I object\nto.  My garden has just been put straight for the winter, and an ox\nroaming about in it won’t improve matters.  Besides, there are the\nchrysanthemums just coming into flower.”\n\n“How did it get into the garden?” asked Eshley.\n\n“I imagine it came in by the gate,” said the lady impatiently; “it\ncouldn’t have climbed the walls, and I don’t suppose anyone dropped it\nfrom an aeroplane as a Bovril advertisement.  The immediately important\nquestion is not how it got in, but how to get it out.”\n\n“Won’t it go?” said Eshley.\n\n“If it was anxious to go,” said Adela Pingsford rather angrily, “I should\nnot have come here to chat with you about it.  I’m practically all alone;\nthe housemaid is having her afternoon out and the cook is lying down with\nan attack of neuralgia.  Anything that I may have learned at school or in\nafter life about how to remove a large ox from a small garden seems to\nhave escaped from my memory now.  All I could think of was that you were\na near neighbour and a cattle painter, presumably more or less familiar\nwith the subjects that you painted, and that you might be of some slight\nassistance.  Possibly I was mistaken.”\n\n“I paint dairy cows, certainly,” admitted Eshley, “but I cannot claim to\nhave had any experience in rounding-up stray oxen.  I’ve seen it done on\na cinema film, of course, but there were always horses and lots of other\naccessories; besides, one never knows how much of those pictures are\nfaked.”\n\nAdela Pingsford said nothing, but led the way to her garden.  It was\nnormally a fair-sized garden, but it looked small in comparison with the\nox, a huge mottled brute, dull red about the head and shoulders, passing\nto dirty white on the flanks and hind-quarters, with shaggy ears and\nlarge blood-shot eyes.  It bore about as much resemblance to the dainty\npaddock heifers that Eshley was accustomed to paint as the chief of a\nKurdish nomad clan would to a Japanese tea-shop girl.  Eshley stood very\nnear the gate while he studied the animal’s appearance and demeanour.\nAdela Pingsford continued to say nothing.\n\n“It’s eating a chrysanthemum,” said Eshley at last, when the silence had\nbecome unbearable.\n\n“How observant you are,” said Adela bitterly.  “You seem to notice\neverything.  As a matter of fact, it has got six chrysanthemums in its\nmouth at the present moment.”\n\nThe necessity for doing something was becoming imperative.  Eshley took a\nstep or two in the direction of the animal, clapped his hands, and made\nnoises of the “Hish” and “Shoo” variety.  If the ox heard them it gave no\noutward indication of the fact.\n\n“If any hens should ever stray into my garden,” said Adela, “I should\ncertainly send for you to frighten them out.  You ‘shoo’ beautifully.\nMeanwhile, do you mind trying to drive that ox away?  That is a\n_Mademoiselle Louise Bichot_ that he’s begun on now,” she added in icy\ncalm, as a glowing orange head was crushed into the huge munching mouth.\n\n“Since you have been so frank about the variety of the chrysanthemum,”\nsaid Eshley, “I don’t mind telling you that this is an Ayrshire ox.”\n\nThe icy calm broke down; Adela Pingsford used language that sent the\nartist instinctively a few feet nearer to the ox.  He picked up a\npea-stick and flung it with some determination against the animal’s\nmottled flanks.  The operation of mashing _Mademoiselle Louise Bichot_\ninto a petal salad was suspended for a long moment, while the ox gazed\nwith concentrated inquiry at the stick-thrower.  Adela gazed with equal\nconcentration and more obvious hostility at the same focus.  As the beast\nneither lowered its head nor stamped its feet Eshley ventured on another\njavelin exercise with another pea-stick.  The ox seemed to realise at\nonce that it was to go; it gave a hurried final pluck at the bed where\nthe chrysanthemums had been, and strode swiftly up the garden.  Eshley\nran to head it towards the gate, but only succeeded in quickening its\npace from a walk to a lumbering trot.  With an air of inquiry, but with\nno real hesitation, it crossed the tiny strip of turf that the charitable\ncalled the croquet lawn, and pushed its way through the open French\nwindow into the morning-room.  Some chrysanthemums and other autumn\nherbage stood about the room in vases, and the animal resumed its\nbrowsing operations; all the same, Eshley fancied that the beginnings of\na hunted look had come into its eyes, a look that counselled respect.  He\ndiscontinued his attempt to interfere with its choice of surroundings.\n\n“Mr. Eshley,” said Adela in a shaking voice, “I asked you to drive that\nbeast out of my garden, but I did not ask you to drive it into my house.\nIf I must have it anywhere on the premises I prefer the garden to the\nmorning-room.”\n\n“Cattle drives are not in my line,” said Eshley; “if I remember I told\nyou so at the outset.”  “I quite agree,” retorted the lady, “painting\npretty pictures of pretty little cows is what you’re suited for.  Perhaps\nyou’d like to do a nice sketch of that ox making itself at home in my\nmorning-room?”\n\nThis time it seemed as if the worm had turned; Eshley began striding\naway.\n\n“Where are you going?” screamed Adela.\n\n“To fetch implements,” was the answer.\n\n“Implements?  I won’t have you use a lasso.  The room will be wrecked if\nthere’s a struggle.”\n\nBut the artist marched out of the garden.  In a couple of minutes he\nreturned, laden with easel, sketching-stool, and painting materials.\n\n“Do you mean to say that you’re going to sit quietly down and paint that\nbrute while it’s destroying my morning-room?” gasped Adela.\n\n“It was your suggestion,” said Eshley, setting his canvas in position.\n\n“I forbid it; I absolutely forbid it!” stormed Adela.\n\n“I don’t see what standing you have in the matter,” said the artist; “you\ncan hardly pretend that it’s your ox, even by adoption.”\n\n“You seem to forget that it’s in my morning-room, eating my flowers,”\ncame the raging retort.\n\n“You seem to forget that the cook has neuralgia,” said Eshley; “she may\nbe just dozing off into a merciful sleep and your outcry will waken her.\nConsideration for others should be the guiding principle of people in our\nstation of life.”\n\n“The man is mad!” exclaimed Adela tragically.  A moment later it was\nAdela herself who appeared to go mad.  The ox had finished the\nvase-flowers and the cover of “Israel Kalisch,” and appeared to be\nthinking of leaving its rather restricted quarters.  Eshley noticed its\nrestlessness and promptly flung it some bunches of Virginia creeper\nleaves as an inducement to continue the sitting.\n\n“I forget how the proverb runs,” he observed; “of something about ‘better\na dinner of herbs than a stalled ox where hate is.’  We seem to have all\nthe ingredients for the proverb ready to hand.”\n\n“I shall go to the Public Library and get them to telephone for the\npolice,” announced Adela, and, raging audibly, she departed.\n\nSome minutes later the ox, awakening probably to the suspicion that oil\ncake and chopped mangold was waiting for it in some appointed byre,\nstepped with much precaution out of the morning-room, stared with grave\ninquiry at the no longer obtrusive and pea-stick-throwing human, and then\nlumbered heavily but swiftly out of the garden.  Eshley packed up his\ntools and followed the animal’s example and “Larkdene” was left to\nneuralgia and the cook.\n\nThe episode was the turning-point in Eshley’s artistic career.  His\nremarkable picture, “Ox in a morning-room, late autumn,” was one of the\nsensations and successes of the next Paris Salon, and when it was\nsubsequently exhibited at Munich it was bought by the Bavarian\nGovernment, in the teeth of the spirited bidding of three meat-extract\nfirms.  From that moment his success was continuous and assured, and the\nRoyal Academy was thankful, two years later, to give a conspicuous\nposition on its walls to his large canvas “Barbary Apes Wrecking a\nBoudoir.”\n\nEshley presented Adela Pingsford with a new copy of “Israel Kalisch,” and\na couple of finely flowering plants of _Madame Adnré Blusset_, but\nnothing in the nature of a real reconciliation has taken place between\nthem.\n\n\n\n\nTHE STORY-TELLER\n\n\nIt was a hot afternoon, and the railway carriage was correspondingly\nsultry, and the next stop was at Templecombe, nearly an hour ahead.  The\noccupants of the carriage were a small girl, and a smaller girl, and a\nsmall boy.  An aunt belonging to the children occupied one corner seat,\nand the further corner seat on the opposite side was occupied by a\nbachelor who was a stranger to their party, but the small girls and the\nsmall boy emphatically occupied the compartment.  Both the aunt and the\nchildren were conversational in a limited, persistent way, reminding one\nof the attentions of a housefly that refuses to be discouraged.  Most of\nthe aunt’s remarks seemed to begin with “Don’t,” and nearly all of the\nchildren’s remarks began with “Why?”  The bachelor said nothing out loud.\n“Don’t, Cyril, don’t,” exclaimed the aunt, as the small boy began\nsmacking the cushions of the seat, producing a cloud of dust at each\nblow.\n\n“Come and look out of the window,” she added.\n\nThe child moved reluctantly to the window.  “Why are those sheep being\ndriven out of that field?” he asked.\n\n“I expect they are being driven to another field where there is more\ngrass,” said the aunt weakly.\n\n“But there is lots of grass in that field,” protested the boy; “there’s\nnothing else but grass there.  Aunt, there’s lots of grass in that\nfield.”\n\n“Perhaps the grass in the other field is better,” suggested the aunt\nfatuously.\n\n“Why is it better?” came the swift, inevitable question.\n\n“Oh, look at those cows!” exclaimed the aunt.  Nearly every field along\nthe line had contained cows or bullocks, but she spoke as though she were\ndrawing attention to a rarity.\n\n“Why is the grass in the other field better?” persisted Cyril.\n\nThe frown on the bachelor’s face was deepening to a scowl.  He was a\nhard, unsympathetic man, the aunt decided in her mind.  She was utterly\nunable to come to any satisfactory decision about the grass in the other\nfield.\n\nThe smaller girl created a diversion by beginning to recite “On the Road\nto Mandalay.”  She only knew the first line, but she put her limited\nknowledge to the fullest possible use.  She repeated the line over and\nover again in a dreamy but resolute and very audible voice; it seemed to\nthe bachelor as though some one had had a bet with her that she could not\nrepeat the line aloud two thousand times without stopping.  Whoever it\nwas who had made the wager was likely to lose his bet.\n\n“Come over here and listen to a story,” said the aunt, when the bachelor\nhad looked twice at her and once at the communication cord.\n\nThe children moved listlessly towards the aunt’s end of the carriage.\nEvidently her reputation as a story-teller did not rank high in their\nestimation.\n\nIn a low, confidential voice, interrupted at frequent intervals by loud,\npetulant questionings from her listeners, she began an unenterprising and\ndeplorably uninteresting story about a little girl who was good, and made\nfriends with every one on account of her goodness, and was finally saved\nfrom a mad bull by a number of rescuers who admired her moral character.\n\n“Wouldn’t they have saved her if she hadn’t been good?” demanded the\nbigger of the small girls.  It was exactly the question that the bachelor\nhad wanted to ask.\n\n“Well, yes,” admitted the aunt lamely, “but I don’t think they would have\nrun quite so fast to her help if they had not liked her so much.”\n\n“It’s the stupidest story I’ve ever heard,” said the bigger of the small\ngirls, with immense conviction.\n\n“I didn’t listen after the first bit, it was so stupid,” said Cyril.\n\nThe smaller girl made no actual comment on the story, but she had long\nago recommenced a murmured repetition of her favourite line.\n\n“You don’t seem to be a success as a story-teller,” said the bachelor\nsuddenly from his corner.\n\nThe aunt bristled in instant defence at this unexpected attack.\n\n“It’s a very difficult thing to tell stories that children can both\nunderstand and appreciate,” she said stiffly.\n\n“I don’t agree with you,” said the bachelor.\n\n“Perhaps you would like to tell them a story,” was the aunt’s retort.\n\n“Tell us a story,” demanded the bigger of the small girls.\n\n“Once upon a time,” began the bachelor, “there was a little girl called\nBertha, who was extraordinarily good.”\n\nThe children’s momentarily-aroused interest began at once to flicker; all\nstories seemed dreadfully alike, no matter who told them.\n\n“She did all that she was told, she was always truthful, she kept her\nclothes clean, ate milk puddings as though they were jam tarts, learned\nher lessons perfectly, and was polite in her manners.”\n\n“Was she pretty?” asked the bigger of the small girls.\n\n“Not as pretty as any of you,” said the bachelor, “but she was horribly\ngood.”\n\nThere was a wave of reaction in favour of the story; the word horrible in\nconnection with goodness was a novelty that commended itself.  It seemed\nto introduce a ring of truth that was absent from the aunt’s tales of\ninfant life.\n\n“She was so good,” continued the bachelor, “that she won several medals\nfor goodness, which she always wore, pinned on to her dress.  There was a\nmedal for obedience, another medal for punctuality, and a third for good\nbehaviour.  They were large metal medals and they clicked against one\nanother as she walked.  No other child in the town where she lived had as\nmany as three medals, so everybody knew that she must be an extra good\nchild.”\n\n“Horribly good,” quoted Cyril.\n\n“Everybody talked about her goodness, and the Prince of the country got\nto hear about it, and he said that as she was so very good she might be\nallowed once a week to walk in his park, which was just outside the town.\nIt was a beautiful park, and no children were ever allowed in it, so it\nwas a great honour for Bertha to be allowed to go there.”\n\n“Were there any sheep in the park?” demanded Cyril.\n\n“No;” said the bachelor, “there were no sheep.”\n\n“Why weren’t there any sheep?” came the inevitable question arising out\nof that answer.\n\nThe aunt permitted herself a smile, which might almost have been\ndescribed as a grin.\n\n“There were no sheep in the park,” said the bachelor, “because the\nPrince’s mother had once had a dream that her son would either be killed\nby a sheep or else by a clock falling on him.  For that reason the Prince\nnever kept a sheep in his park or a clock in his palace.”\n\nThe aunt suppressed a gasp of admiration.\n\n“Was the Prince killed by a sheep or by a clock?” asked Cyril.\n\n“He is still alive, so we can’t tell whether the dream will come true,”\nsaid the bachelor unconcernedly; “anyway, there were no sheep in the\npark, but there were lots of little pigs running all over the place.”\n\n“What colour were they?”\n\n“Black with white faces, white with black spots, black all over, grey\nwith white patches, and some were white all over.”\n\nThe story-teller paused to let a full idea of the park’s treasures sink\ninto the children’s imaginations; then he resumed:\n\n“Bertha was rather sorry to find that there were no flowers in the park.\nShe had promised her aunts, with tears in her eyes, that she would not\npick any of the kind Prince’s flowers, and she had meant to keep her\npromise, so of course it made her feel silly to find that there were no\nflowers to pick.”\n\n“Why weren’t there any flowers?”\n\n“Because the pigs had eaten them all,” said the bachelor promptly.  “The\ngardeners had told the Prince that you couldn’t have pigs and flowers, so\nhe decided to have pigs and no flowers.”\n\nThere was a murmur of approval at the excellence of the Prince’s\ndecision; so many people would have decided the other way.\n\n“There were lots of other delightful things in the park.  There were\nponds with gold and blue and green fish in them, and trees with beautiful\nparrots that said clever things at a moment’s notice, and humming birds\nthat hummed all the popular tunes of the day.  Bertha walked up and down\nand enjoyed herself immensely, and thought to herself: ‘If I were not so\nextraordinarily good I should not have been allowed to come into this\nbeautiful park and enjoy all that there is to be seen in it,’ and her\nthree medals clinked against one another as she walked and helped to\nremind her how very good she really was.  Just then an enormous wolf came\nprowling into the park to see if it could catch a fat little pig for its\nsupper.”\n\n“What colour was it?” asked the children, amid an immediate quickening of\ninterest.\n\n“Mud-colour all over, with a black tongue and pale grey eyes that gleamed\nwith unspeakable ferocity.  The first thing that it saw in the park was\nBertha; her pinafore was so spotlessly white and clean that it could be\nseen from a great distance.  Bertha saw the wolf and saw that it was\nstealing towards her, and she began to wish that she had never been\nallowed to come into the park.  She ran as hard as she could, and the\nwolf came after her with huge leaps and bounds.  She managed to reach a\nshrubbery of myrtle bushes and she hid herself in one of the thickest of\nthe bushes.  The wolf came sniffing among the branches, its black tongue\nlolling out of its mouth and its pale grey eyes glaring with rage.\nBertha was terribly frightened, and thought to herself: ‘If I had not\nbeen so extraordinarily good I should have been safe in the town at this\nmoment.’  However, the scent of the myrtle was so strong that the wolf\ncould not sniff out where Bertha was hiding, and the bushes were so thick\nthat he might have hunted about in them for a long time without catching\nsight of her, so he thought he might as well go off and catch a little\npig instead.  Bertha was trembling very much at having the wolf prowling\nand sniffing so near her, and as she trembled the medal for obedience\nclinked against the medals for good conduct and punctuality.  The wolf\nwas just moving away when he heard the sound of the medals clinking and\nstopped to listen; they clinked again in a bush quite near him.  He\ndashed into the bush, his pale grey eyes gleaming with ferocity and\ntriumph, and dragged Bertha out and devoured her to the last morsel.  All\nthat was left of her were her shoes, bits of clothing, and the three\nmedals for goodness.”\n\n“Were any of the little pigs killed?”\n\n“No, they all escaped.”\n\n“The story began badly,” said the smaller of the small girls, “but it had\na beautiful ending.”\n\n“It is the most beautiful story that I ever heard,” said the bigger of\nthe small girls, with immense decision.\n\n“It is the _only_ beautiful story I have ever heard,” said Cyril.\n\nA dissentient opinion came from the aunt.\n\n“A most improper story to tell to young children!  You have undermined\nthe effect of years of careful teaching.”\n\n“At any rate,” said the bachelor, collecting his belongings preparatory\nto leaving the carriage, “I kept them quiet for ten minutes, which was\nmore than you were able to do.”\n\n“Unhappy woman!” he observed to himself as he walked down the platform of\nTemplecombe station; “for the next six months or so those children will\nassail her in public with demands for an improper story!”\n\n\n\n\nA DEFENSIVE DIAMOND\n\n\nTreddleford sat in an easeful arm-chair in front of a slumberous fire,\nwith a volume of verse in his hand and the comfortable consciousness that\noutside the club windows the rain was dripping and pattering with\npersistent purpose.  A chill, wet October afternoon was merging into a\nbleak, wet October evening, and the club smoking-room seemed warmer and\ncosier by contrast.  It was an afternoon on which to be wafted away from\none’s climatic surroundings, and “The Golden Journey to Samarkand”\npromised to bear Treddleford well and bravely into other lands and under\nother skies.  He had already migrated from London the rain-swept to\nBagdad the Beautiful, and stood by the Sun Gate “in the olden time” when\nan icy breath of imminent annoyance seemed to creep between the book and\nhimself.  Amblecope, the man with the restless, prominent eyes and the\nmouth ready mobilised for conversational openings, had planted himself in\na neighbouring arm-chair.  For a twelvemonth and some odd weeks\nTreddleford had skilfully avoided making the acquaintance of his voluble\nfellow-clubman; he had marvellously escaped from the infliction of his\nrelentless record of tedious personal achievements, or alleged\nachievements, on golf links, turf, and gaming table, by flood and field\nand covert-side.  Now his season of immunity was coming to an end.  There\nwas no escape; in another moment he would be numbered among those who\nknew Amblecope to speak to—or rather, to suffer being spoken to.\n\nThe intruder was armed with a copy of _Country Life_, not for purposes of\nreading, but as an aid to conversational ice-breaking.\n\n“Rather a good portrait of Throstlewing,” he remarked explosively,\nturning his large challenging eyes on Treddleford; “somehow it reminds me\nvery much of Yellowstep, who was supposed to be such a good thing for the\nGrand Prix in 1903.  Curious race that was; I suppose I’ve seen every\nrace for the Grand Prix for the last—”\n\n“Be kind enough never to mention the Grand Prix in my hearing,” said\nTreddleford desperately; “it awakens acutely distressing memories.  I\ncan’t explain why without going into a long and complicated story.”\n\n“Oh, certainly, certainly,” said Amblecope hastily; long and complicated\nstories that were not told by himself were abominable in his eyes.  He\nturned the pages of _Country Life_ and became spuriously interested in\nthe picture of a Mongolian pheasant.\n\n“Not a bad representation of the Mongolian variety,” he exclaimed,\nholding it up for his neighbour’s inspection.  “They do very well in some\ncovers.  Take some stopping too, once they’re fairly on the wing.  I\nsuppose the biggest bag I ever made in two successive days—”\n\n“My aunt, who owns the greater part of Lincolnshire,” broke in\nTreddleford, with dramatic abruptness, “possesses perhaps the most\nremarkable record in the way of a pheasant bag that has ever been\nachieved.  She is seventy-five and can’t hit a thing, but she always goes\nout with the guns.  When I say she can’t hit a thing, I don’t mean to say\nthat she doesn’t occasionally endanger the lives of her fellow-guns,\nbecause that wouldn’t be true.  In fact, the chief Government Whip won’t\nallow Ministerial M.P.’s to go out with her; ‘We don’t want to incur\nby-elections needlessly,’ he quite reasonably observed.  Well, the other\nday she winged a pheasant, and brought it to earth with a feather or two\nknocked out of it; it was a runner, and my aunt saw herself in danger of\nbeing done out of about the only bird she’d hit during the present reign.\nOf course she wasn’t going to stand that; she followed it through bracken\nand brushwood, and when it took to the open country and started across a\nploughed field she jumped on to the shooting pony and went after it.  The\nchase was a long one, and when my aunt at last ran the bird to a\nstandstill she was nearer home than she was to the shooting party; she\nhad left that some five miles behind her.”\n\n“Rather a long run for a wounded pheasant,” snapped Amblecope.\n\n“The story rests on my aunt’s authority,” said Treddleford coldly, “and\nshe is local vice-president of the Young Women’s Christian Association.\nShe trotted three miles or so to her home, and it was not till the middle\nof the afternoon that it was discovered that the lunch for the entire\nshooting party was in a pannier attached to the pony’s saddle.  Anyway,\nshe got her bird.”\n\n“Some birds, of course, take a lot of killing,” said Amblecope; “so do\nsome fish.  I remember once I was fishing in the Exe, lovely trout\nstream, lots of fish, though they don’t run to any great size—”\n\n“One of them did,” announced Treddleford, with emphasis.  “My uncle, the\nBishop of Southmolton, came across a giant trout in a pool just off the\nmain stream of the Exe near Ugworthy; he tried it with every kind of fly\nand worm every day for three weeks without an atom of success, and then\nFate intervened on his behalf.  There was a low stone bridge just over\nthis pool, and on the last day of his fishing holiday a motor van ran\nviolently into the parapet and turned completely over; no one was hurt,\nbut part of the parapet was knocked away, and the entire load that the\nvan was carrying was pitched over and fell a little way into the pool.\nIn a couple of minutes the giant trout was flapping and twisting on bare\nmud at the bottom of a waterless pool, and my uncle was able to walk down\nto him and fold him to his breast.  The van-load consisted of\nblotting-paper, and every drop of water in that pool had been sucked up\ninto the mass of spilt cargo.”\n\nThere was silence for nearly half a minute in the smoking-room, and\nTreddleford began to let his mind steal back towards the golden road that\nled to Samarkand.  Amblecope, however, rallied, and remarked in a rather\ntired and dispirited voice:\n\n“Talking of motor accidents, the narrowest squeak I ever had was the\nother day, motoring with old Tommy Yarby in North Wales.  Awfully good\nsort, old Yarby, thorough good sportsman, and the best—”\n\n“It was in North Wales,” said Treddleford, “that my sister met with her\nsensational carriage accident last year.  She was on her way to a\ngarden-party at Lady Nineveh’s, about the only garden-party that ever\ncomes to pass in those parts in the course of the year, and therefore a\nthing that she would have been very sorry to miss.  She was driving a\nyoung horse that she’d only bought a week or two previously, warranted to\nbe perfectly steady with motor traffic, bicycles, and other common\nobjects of the roadside.  The animal lived up to its reputation, and\npassed the most explosive of motor-bikes with an indifference that almost\namounted to apathy.  However, I suppose we all draw the line somewhere,\nand this particular cob drew it at travelling wild beast shows.  Of\ncourse my sister didn’t know that, but she knew it very distinctly when\nshe turned a sharp corner and found herself in a mixed company of camels,\npiebald horses, and canary-coloured vans.  The dogcart was overturned in\na ditch and kicked to splinters, and the cob went home across country.\nNeither my sister nor the groom was hurt, but the problem of how to get\nto the Nineveh garden-party, some three miles distant, seemed rather\ndifficult to solve; once there, of course, my sister would easily find\nsome one to drive her home.  ‘I suppose you wouldn’t care for the loan of\na couple of my camels?’ the showman suggested, in humorous sympathy.  ‘I\nwould,’ said my sister, who had ridden camel-back in Egypt, and she\noverruled the objections of the groom, who hadn’t.  She picked out two of\nthe most presentable-looking of the beasts and had them dusted and made\nas tidy as was possible at short notice, and set out for the Nineveh\nmansion.  You may imagine the sensation that her small but imposing\ncaravan created when she arrived at the hall door.  The entire\ngarden-party flocked up to gape.  My sister was rather glad to slip down\nfrom her camel, and the groom was thankful to scramble down from his.\nThen young Billy Doulton, of the Dragoon Guards, who has been a lot at\nAden and thinks he knows camel-language backwards, thought he would show\noff by making the beasts kneel down in orthodox fashion.  Unfortunately\ncamel words-of-command are not the same all the world over; these were\nmagnificent Turkestan camels, accustomed to stride up the stony terraces\nof mountain passes, and when Doulton shouted at them they went side by\nside up the front steps, into the entrance hall, and up the grand\nstaircase.  The German governess met them just at the turn of the\ncorridor.  The Ninevehs nursed her with devoted attention for weeks, and\nwhen I last heard from them she was well enough to go about her duties\nagain, but the doctor says she will always suffer from Hagenbeck heart.”\n\nAmblecope got up from his chair and moved to another part of the room.\nTreddleford reopened his book and betook himself once more across\n\n    The dragon-green, the luminous, the dark, the serpent-haunted sea.\n\nFor a blessed half-hour he disported himself in imagination by the “gay\nAleppo-Gate,” and listened to the bird-voiced singing-man.  Then the\nworld of to-day called him back; a page summoned him to speak with a\nfriend on the telephone.\n\nAs Treddleford was about to pass out of the room he encountered\nAmblecope, also passing out, on his way to the billiard-room, where,\nperchance, some luckless wight might be secured and held fast to listen\nto the number of his attendances at the Grand Prix, with subsequent\nremarks on Newmarket and the Cambridgeshire.  Amblecope made as if to\npass out first, but a new-born pride was surging in Treddleford’s breast\nand he waved him back.\n\n“I believe I take precedence,” he said coldly; “you are merely the club\nBore; I am the club Liar.”\n\n\n\n\nTHE ELK\n\n\nTeresa, Mrs. Thropplestance, was the richest and most intractable old\nwoman in the county of Woldshire.  In her dealings with the world in\ngeneral her manner suggested a blend between a Mistress of the Robes and\na Master of Foxhounds, with the vocabulary of both.  In her domestic\ncircle she comported herself in the arbitrary style that one attributes,\nprobably without the least justification, to an American political Boss\nin the bosom of his caucus.  The late Theodore Thropplestance had left\nher, some thirty-five years ago, in absolute possession of a considerable\nfortune, a large landed property, and a gallery full of valuable\npictures.  In those intervening years she had outlived her son and\nquarrelled with her elder grandson, who had married without her consent\nor approval.  Bertie Thropplestance, her younger grandson, was the\nheir-designate to her property, and as such he was a centre of interest\nand concern to some half-hundred ambitious mothers with daughters of\nmarriageable age.  Bertie was an amiable, easy-going young man, who was\nquite ready to marry anyone who was favourably recommended to his notice,\nbut he was not going to waste his time in falling in love with anyone who\nwould come under his grandmother’s veto.  The favourable recommendation\nwould have to come from Mrs. Thropplestance.\n\nTeresa’s house-parties were always rounded off with a plentiful\ngarnishing of presentable young women and alert, attendant mothers, but\nthe old lady was emphatically discouraging whenever any one of her girl\nguests became at all likely to outbid the others as a possible\ngranddaughter-in-law.  It was the inheritance of her fortune and estate\nthat was in question, and she was evidently disposed to exercise and\nenjoy her powers of selection and rejection to the utmost.  Bertie’s\npreferences did not greatly matter; he was of the sort who can be\nstolidly happy with any kind of wife; he had cheerfully put up with his\ngrandmother all his life, so was not likely to fret and fume over\nanything that might befall him in the way of a helpmate.\n\nThe party that gathered under Teresa’s roof in Christmas week of the year\nnineteen-hundred-and-something was of smaller proportions than usual, and\nMrs. Yonelet, who formed one of the party, was inclined to deduce hopeful\naugury from this circumstance.  Dora Yonelet and Bertie were so obviously\nmade for one another, she confided to the vicar’s wife, and if the old\nlady were accustomed to seeing them about a lot together she might adopt\nthe view that they would make a suitable married couple.\n\n“People soon get used to an idea if it is dangled constantly before their\neyes,” said Mrs. Yonelet hopefully, “and the more often Teresa sees those\nyoung people together, happy in each other’s company, the more she will\nget to take a kindly interest in Dora as a possible and desirable wife\nfor Bertie.”\n\n“My dear,” said the vicar’s wife resignedly, “my own Sybil was thrown\ntogether with Bertie under the most romantic circumstances—I’ll tell you\nabout it some day—but it made no impression whatever on Teresa; she put\nher foot down in the most uncompromising fashion, and Sybil married an\nIndian civilian.”\n\n“Quite right of her,” said Mrs. Yonelet with vague approval; “it’s what\nany girl of spirit would have done.  Still, that was a year or two ago, I\nbelieve; Bertie is older now, and so is Teresa.  Naturally she must be\nanxious to see him settled.”\n\nThe vicar’s wife reflected that Teresa seemed to be the one person who\nshowed no immediate anxiety to supply Bertie with a wife, but she kept\nthe thought to herself.\n\nMrs. Yonelet was a woman of resourceful energy and generalship; she\ninvolved the other members of the house-party, the deadweight, so to\nspeak, in all manner of exercises and occupations that segregated them\nfrom Bertie and Dora, who were left to their own devisings—that is to\nsay, to Dora’s devisings and Bertie’s accommodating acquiescence.  Dora\nhelped in the Christmas decorations of the parish church, and Bertie\nhelped her to help.  Together they fed the swans, till the birds went on\na dyspepsia-strike, together they played billiards, together they\nphotographed the village almshouses, and, at a respectful distance, the\ntame elk that browsed in solitary aloofness in the park.  It was “tame”\nin the sense that it had long ago discarded the least vestige of fear of\nthe human race; nothing in its record encouraged its human neighbours to\nfeel a reciprocal confidence.\n\nWhatever sport or exercise or occupation Bertie and Dora indulged in\ntogether was unfailingly chronicled and advertised by Mrs. Yonelet for\nthe due enlightenment of Bertie’s grandmother.\n\n“Those two inseparables have just come in from a bicycle ride,” she would\nannounce; “quite a picture they make, so fresh and glowing after their\nspin.”\n\n“A picture needing words,” would be Teresa’s private comment, and as far\nas Bertie was concerned she was determined that the words should remain\nunspoken.\n\nOn the afternoon after Christmas Day Mrs. Yonelet dashed into the\ndrawing-room, where her hostess was sitting amid a circle of guests and\nteacups and muffin-dishes.  Fate had placed what seemed like a trump-card\nin the hands of the patiently-manoeuvring mother.  With eyes blazing with\nexcitement and a voice heavily escorted with exclamation marks she made a\ndramatic announcement.\n\n“Bertie has saved Dora from the elk!”\n\nIn swift, excited sentences, broken with maternal emotion, she gave\nsupplementary information as to how the treacherous animal had ambushed\nDora as she was hunting for a strayed golf ball, and how Bertie had\ndashed to her rescue with a stable fork and driven the beast off in the\nnick of time.\n\n“It was touch and go!  She threw her niblick at it, but that didn’t stop\nit.  In another moment she would have been crushed beneath its hoofs,”\npanted Mrs. Yonelet.\n\n“The animal is not safe,” said Teresa, handing her agitated guest a cup\nof tea.  “I forget if you take sugar.  I suppose the solitary life it\nleads has soured its temper.  There are muffins in the grate.  It’s not\nmy fault; I’ve tried to get it a mate for ever so long.  You don’t know\nof anyone with a lady elk for sale or exchange, do you?” she asked the\ncompany generally.\n\nBut Mrs. Yonelet was in no humour to listen to talk of elk marriages.\nThe mating of two human beings was the subject uppermost in her mind, and\nthe opportunity for advancing her pet project was too valuable to be\nneglected.\n\n“Teresa,” she exclaimed impressively, “after those two young people have\nbeen thrown together so dramatically, nothing can be quite the same again\nbetween them.  Bertie has done more than save Dora’s life; he has earned\nher affection.  One cannot help feeling that Fate has consecrated them\nfor one another.”\n\n“Exactly what the vicar’s wife said when Bertie saved Sybil from the elk\na year or two ago,” observed Teresa placidly; “I pointed out to her that\nhe had rescued Mirabel Hicks from the same predicement a few months\npreviously, and that priority really belonged to the gardener’s boy, who\nhad been rescued in the January of that year.  There is a good deal of\nsameness in country life, you know.”\n\n“It seems to be a very dangerous animal,” said one of the guests.\n\n“That’s what the mother of the gardener’s boy said,” remarked Teresa;\n“she wanted me to have it destroyed, but I pointed out to her that she\nhad eleven children and I had only one elk.  I also gave her a black silk\nskirt; she said that though there hadn’t been a funeral in her family she\nfelt as if there had been.  Anyhow, we parted friends.  I can’t offer you\na silk skirt, Emily, but you may have another cup of tea.  As I have\nalready remarked, there are muffins in the grate.”\n\nTeresa closed the discussion, having deftly conveyed the impression that\nshe considered the mother of the gardener’s boy had shown a far more\nreasonable spirit than the parents of other elk-assaulted victims.\n\n“Teresa is devoid of feeling,” said Mrs. Yonelet afterwards to the\nvicar’s wife; “to sit there, talking of muffins, with an appalling\ntragedy only narrowly averted—”\n\n“Of course you know whom she really intends Bertie to marry?” asked the\nvicar’s wife; “I’ve noticed it for some time.  The Bickelbys’ German\ngoverness.”\n\n“A German governess!  What an idea!” gasped Mrs. Yonelet.\n\n“She’s of quite good family, I believe,” said the vicar’s wife, “and not\nat all the mouse-in-the-back-ground sort of person that governesses are\nusually supposed to be.  In fact, next to Teresa, she’s about the most\nassertive and combative personality in the neighbourhood.  She’s pointed\nout to my husband all sorts of errors in his sermons, and she gave Sir\nLaurence a public lecture on how he ought to handle the hounds.  You know\nhow sensitive Sir Laurence is about any criticism of his Mastership, and\nto have a governess laying down the law to him nearly drove him into a\nfit.  She’s behaved like that to every one, except, of course, Teresa,\nand every one has been defensively rude to her in return.  The Bickelbys\nare simply too afraid of her to get rid of her.  Now isn’t that exactly\nthe sort of woman whom Teresa would take a delight in installing as her\nsuccessor?  Imagine the discomfort and awkwardness in the county if we\nsuddenly found that she was to be the future hostess at the Hall.\nTeresa’s only regret will be that she won’t be alive to see it.”\n\n“But,” objected Mrs. Yonelet, “surely Bertie hasn’t shown the least sign\nof being attracted in that quarter?”\n\n“Oh, she’s quite nice-looking in a way, and dresses well, and plays a\ngood game of tennis.  She often comes across the park with messages from\nthe Bickelby mansion, and one of these days Bertie will rescue her from\nthe elk, which has become almost a habit with him, and Teresa will say\nthat Fate has consecrated them to one another.  Bertie might not be\ndisposed to pay much attention to the consecrations of Fate, but he would\nnot dream of opposing his grandmother.”\n\nThe vicar’s wife spoke with the quiet authority of one who has intuitive\nknowledge, and in her heart of hearts Mrs. Yonelet believed her.\n\nSix months later the elk had to be destroyed.  In a fit of exceptional\nmoroseness it had killed the Bickelbys’ German governess.  It was an\nirony of its fate that it should achieve popularity in the last moments\nof its career; at any rate, it established the record of being the only\nliving thing that had permanently thwarted Teresa Thropplestance’s plans.\n\nDora Yonelet broke off her engagement with an Indian civilian, and\nmarried Bertie three months after his grandmother’s death—Teresa did not\nlong survive the German governess fiasco.  At Christmas time every year\nyoung Mrs. Thropplestance hangs an extra large festoon of evergreens on\nthe elk horns that decorate the hall.\n\n“It was a fearsome beast,” she observes to Bertie, “but I always feel\nthat it was instrumental in bringing us together.”\n\nWhich, of course, was true.\n\n\n\n\n“DOWN PENS”\n\n\n“Have you written to thank the Froplinsons for what they sent us?” asked\nEgbert.\n\n“No,” said Janetta, with a note of tired defiance in her voice; “I’ve\nwritten eleven letters to-day expressing surprise and gratitude for\nsundry unmerited gifts, but I haven’t written to the Froplinsons.”\n\n“Some one will have to write to them,” said Egbert.\n\n“I don’t dispute the necessity, but I don’t think the some one should be\nme,” said Janetta.  “I wouldn’t mind writing a letter of angry\nrecrimination or heartless satire to some suitable recipient; in fact, I\nshould rather enjoy it, but I’ve come to the end of my capacity for\nexpressing servile amiability.  Eleven letters to-day and nine yesterday,\nall couched in the same strain of ecstatic thankfulness: really, you\ncan’t expect me to sit down to another.  There is such a thing as writing\noneself out.”\n\n“I’ve written nearly as many,” said Egbert, “and I’ve had my usual\nbusiness correspondence to get through, too.  Besides, I don’t know what\nit was that the Froplinsons sent us.”\n\n“A William the Conqueror calendar,” said Janetta, “with a quotation of\none of his great thoughts for every day in the year.”\n\n“Impossible,” said Egbert; “he didn’t have three hundred and sixty-five\nthoughts in the whole of his life, or, if he did, he kept them to\nhimself.  He was a man of action, not of introspection.”\n\n“Well, it was William Wordsworth, then,” said Janetta; “I know William\ncame into it somewhere.”\n\n“That sounds more probable,” said Egbert; “well, let’s collaborate on\nthis letter of thanks and get it done.  I’ll dictate, and you can\nscribble it down.  ‘Dear Mrs. Froplinson—thank you and your husband so\nmuch for the very pretty calendar you sent us.  It was very good of you\nto think of us.’”\n\n“You can’t possibly say that,” said Janetta, laying down her pen.\n\n“It’s what I always do say, and what every one says to me,” protested\nEgbert.\n\n“We sent them something on the twenty-second,” said Janetta, “so they\nsimply _had_ to think of us.  There was no getting away from it.”\n\n“What did we send them?” asked Egbert gloomily.\n\n“Bridge-markers,” said Janetta, “in a cardboard case, with some inanity\nabout ‘digging for fortune with a royal spade’ emblazoned on the cover.\nThe moment I saw it in the shop I said to myself ‘Froplinsons’ and to the\nattendant ‘How much?’  When he said ‘Ninepence,’ I gave him their\naddress, jabbed our card in, paid tenpence or elevenpence to cover the\npostage, and thanked heaven.  With less sincerity and infinitely more\ntrouble they eventually thanked me.”\n\n“The Froplinsons don’t play bridge,” said Egbert.\n\n“One is not supposed to notice social deformities of that sort,” said\nJanetta; “it wouldn’t be polite.  Besides, what trouble did they take to\nfind out whether we read Wordsworth with gladness?   For all they knew or\ncared we might be frantically embedded in the belief that all poetry\nbegins and ends with John Masefield, and it might infuriate or depress us\nto have a daily sample of Wordsworthian products flung at us.”\n\n“Well, let’s get on with the letter of thanks,” said Egbert.\n\n“Proceed,” said Janetta.\n\n“‘How clever of you to guess that Wordsworth is our favourite poet,’”\ndictated Egbert.\n\nAgain Janetta laid down her pen.\n\n“Do you realise what that means?” she asked; “a Wordsworth booklet next\nChristmas, and another calendar the Christmas after, with the same\nproblem of having to write suitable letters of thankfulness.  No, the\nbest thing to do is to drop all further allusion to the calendar and\nswitch off on to some other topic.”\n\n“But what other topic?”\n\n“Oh, something like this: ‘What do you think of the New Year Honours\nList?  A friend of ours made such a clever remark when he read it.’  Then\nyou can stick in any remark that comes into your head; it needn’t be\nclever.  The Froplinsons won’t know whether it is or isn’t.”\n\n“We don’t even know on which side they are in politics,” objected Egbert;\n“and anyhow you can’t suddenly dismiss the subject of the calendar.\nSurely there must be some intelligent remark that can be made about it.”\n\n“Well, we can’t think of one,” said Janetta wearily; “the fact is, we’ve\nboth written ourselves out.  Heavens!  I’ve just remembered Mrs. Stephen\nLudberry.  I haven’t thanked her for what she sent.”\n\n“What did she send?”\n\n“I forget; I think it was a calendar.”\n\nThere was a long silence, the forlorn silence of those who are bereft of\nhope and have almost ceased to care.\n\nPresently Egbert started from his seat with an air of resolution.  The\nlight of battle was in his eyes.\n\n“Let me come to the writing-table,” he exclaimed.\n\n“Gladly,” said Janetta.  “Are you going to write to Mrs. Ludberry or the\nFroplinsons?”\n\n“To neither,” said Egbert, drawing a stack of notepaper towards him; “I’m\ngoing to write to the editor of every enlightened and influential\nnewspaper in the Kingdom, I’m going to suggest that there should be a\nsort of epistolary Truce of God during the festivities of Christmas and\nNew Year.  From the twenty-fourth of December to the third or fourth of\nJanuary it shall be considered an offence against good sense and good\nfeeling to write or expect any letter or communication that does not deal\nwith the necessary events of the moment.  Answers to invitations,\narrangements about trains, renewal of club subscriptions, and, of course,\nall the ordinary everyday affairs of business, sickness, engaging new\ncooks, and so forth, these will be dealt with in the usual manner as\nsomething inevitable, a legitimate part of our daily life.  But all the\ndevastating accretions of correspondence, incident to the festive season,\nthese should be swept away to give the season a chance of being really\nfestive, a time of untroubled, unpunctuated peace and good will.”\n\n“But you would have to make some acknowledgment of presents received,”\nobjected Janetta; “otherwise people would never know whether they had\narrived safely.”\n\n“Of course, I have thought of that,” said Egbert; “every present that was\nsent off would be accompanied by a ticket bearing the date of dispatch\nand the signature of the sender, and some conventional hieroglyphic to\nshow that it was intended to be a Christmas or New Year gift; there would\nbe a counterfoil with space for the recipient’s name and the date of\narrival, and all you would have to do would be to sign and date the\ncounterfoil, add a conventional hieroglyphic indicating heartfelt thanks\nand gratified surprise, put the thing into an envelope and post it.”\n\n“It sounds delightfully simple,” said Janetta wistfully, “but people\nwould consider it too cut-and-dried, too perfunctory.”\n\n“It is not a bit more perfunctory than the present system,” said Egbert;\n“I have only the same conventional language of gratitude at my disposal\nwith which to thank dear old Colonel Chuttle for his perfectly delicious\nStilton, which we shall devour to the last morsel, and the Froplinsons\nfor their calendar, which we shall never look at.  Colonel Chuttle knows\nthat we are grateful for the Stilton, without having to be told so, and\nthe Froplinsons know that we are bored with their calendar, whatever we\nmay say to the contrary, just as we know that they are bored with the\nbridge-markers in spite of their written assurance that they thanked us\nfor our charming little gift.  What is more, the Colonel knows that even\nif we had taken a sudden aversion to Stilton or been forbidden it by the\ndoctor, we should still have written a letter of hearty thanks around it.\nSo you see the present system of acknowledgment is just as perfunctory\nand conventional as the counterfoil business would be, only ten times\nmore tiresome and brain-racking.”\n\n“Your plan would certainly bring the ideal of a Happy Christmas a step\nnearer realisation,” said Janetta.\n\n“There are exceptions, of course,” said Egbert, “people who really try to\ninfuse a breath of reality into their letters of acknowledgment.  Aunt\nSusan, for instance, who writes: ‘Thank you very much for the ham; not\nsuch a good flavour as the one you sent last year, which itself was not a\nparticularly good one.  Hams are not what they used to be.’  It would be\na pity to be deprived of her Christmas comments, but that loss would be\nswallowed up in the general gain.”\n\n“Meanwhile,” said Janetta, “what am I to say to the Froplinsons?”\n\n\n\n\nTHE NAME-DAY\n\n\nAdventures, according to the proverb, are to the adventurous.  Quite as\noften they are to the non-adventurous, to the retiring, to the\nconstitutionally timid.  John James Abbleway had been endowed by Nature\nwith the sort of disposition that instinctively avoids Carlist intrigues,\nslum crusades, the tracking of wounded wild beasts, and the moving of\nhostile amendments at political meetings.  If a mad dog or a Mad Mullah\nhad come his way he would have surrendered the way without hesitation.\nAt school he had unwillingly acquired a thorough knowledge of the German\ntongue out of deference to the plainly-expressed wishes of a\nforeign-languages master, who, though he taught modern subjects, employed\nold-fashioned methods in driving his lessons home.  It was this enforced\nfamiliarity with an important commercial language which thrust Abbleway\nin later years into strange lands where adventures were less easy to\nguard against than in the ordered atmosphere of an English country town.\nThe firm that he worked for saw fit to send him one day on a prosaic\nbusiness errand to the far city of Vienna, and, having sent him there,\ncontinued to keep him there, still engaged in humdrum affairs of\ncommerce, but with the possibilities of romance and adventure, or even\nmisadventure, jostling at his elbow.  After two and a half years of\nexile, however, John James Abbleway had embarked on only one hazardous\nundertaking, and that was of a nature which would assuredly have\novertaken him sooner or later if he had been leading a sheltered,\nstay-at-home existence at Dorking or Huntingdon.  He fell placidly in\nlove with a placidly lovable English girl, the sister of one of his\ncommercial colleagues, who was improving her mind by a short trip to\nforeign parts, and in due course he was formally accepted as the young\nman she was engaged to.  The further step by which she was to become Mrs.\nJohn Abbleway was to take place a twelvemonth hence in a town in the\nEnglish midlands, by which time the firm that employed John James would\nhave no further need for his presence in the Austrian capital.\n\nIt was early in April, two months after the installation of Abbleway as\nthe young man Miss Penning was engaged to, when he received a letter from\nher, written from Venice.  She was still peregrinating under the wing of\nher brother, and as the latter’s business arrangements would take him\nacross to Fiume for a day or two, she had conceived the idea that it\nwould be rather jolly if John could obtain leave of absence and run down\nto the Adriatic coast to meet them.  She had looked up the route on the\nmap, and the journey did not appear likely to be expensive.  Between the\nlines of her communication there lay a hint that if he really cared for\nher—\n\nAbbleway obtained leave of absence and added a journey to Fiume to his\nlife’s adventures.  He left Vienna on a cold, cheerless day.  The flower\nshops were full of spring blooms, and the weekly organs of illustrated\nhumour were full of spring topics, but the skies were heavy with clouds\nthat looked like cotton-wool that has been kept over long in a shop\nwindow.\n\n“Snow comes,” said the train official to the station officials; and they\nagreed that snow was about to come.  And it came, rapidly, plenteously.\nThe train had not been more than an hour on its journey when the\ncotton-wool clouds commenced to dissolve in a blinding downpour of\nsnowflakes.  The forest trees on either side of the line were speedily\ncoated with a heavy white mantle, the telegraph wires became thick\nglistening ropes, the line itself was buried more and more completely\nunder a carpeting of snow, through which the not very powerful engine\nploughed its way with increasing difficulty.  The Vienna-Fiume line is\nscarcely the best equipped of the Austrian State railways, and Abbleway\nbegan to have serious fears for a breakdown.  The train had slowed down\nto a painful and precarious crawl and presently came to a halt at a spot\nwhere the drifting snow had accumulated in a formidable barrier.  The\nengine made a special effort and broke through the obstruction, but in\nthe course of another twenty minutes it was again held up.  The process\nof breaking through was renewed, and the train doggedly resumed its way,\nencountering and surmounting fresh hindrances at frequent intervals.\nAfter a standstill of unusually long duration in a particularly deep\ndrift the compartment in which Abbleway was sitting gave a huge jerk and\na lurch, and then seemed to remain stationary; it undoubtedly was not\nmoving, and yet he could hear the puffing of the engine and the slow\nrumbling and jolting of wheels.  The puffing and rumbling grew fainter,\nas though it were dying away through the agency of intervening distance.\nAbbleway suddenly gave vent to an exclamation of scandalised alarm,\nopened the window, and peered out into the snowstorm.  The flakes perched\non his eyelashes and blurred his vision, but he saw enough to help him to\nrealise what had happened.  The engine had made a mighty plunge through\nthe drift and had gone merrily forward, lightened of the load of its rear\ncarriage, whose coupling had snapped under the strain.  Abbleway was\nalone, or almost alone, with a derelict railway waggon, in the heart of\nsome Styrian or Croatian forest.  In the third-class compartment next to\nhis own he remembered to have seen a peasant woman, who had entered the\ntrain at a small wayside station.  “With the exception of that woman,” he\nexclaimed dramatically to himself, “the nearest living beings are\nprobably a pack of wolves.”\n\nBefore making his way to the third-class compartment to acquaint his\nfellow-traveller with the extent of the disaster Abbleway hurriedly\npondered the question of the woman’s nationality.  He had acquired a\nsmattering of Slavonic tongues during his residence in Vienna, and felt\ncompetent to grapple with several racial possibilities.\n\n“If she is Croat or Serb or Bosniak I shall be able to make her\nunderstand,” he promised himself.  “If she is Magyar, heaven help me!  We\nshall have to converse entirely by signs.”\n\nHe entered the carriage and made his momentous announcement in the best\napproach to Croat speech that he could achieve.\n\n“The train has broken away and left us!”\n\nThe woman shook her head with a movement that might be intended to convey\nresignation to the will of heaven, but probably meant noncomprehension.\nAbbleway repeated his information with variations of Slavonic tongues and\ngenerous displays of pantomime.\n\n“Ah,” said the woman at last in German dialect, “the train has gone?  We\nare left.  Ah, so.”\n\nShe seemed about as much interested as though Abbleway had told her the\nresult of the municipal elections in Amsterdam.\n\n“They will find out at some station, and when the line is clear of snow\nthey will send an engine.  It happens that way sometimes.”\n\n“We may be here all night!” exclaimed Abbleway.\n\nThe woman nodded as though she thought it possible.\n\n“Are there wolves in these parts?” asked Abbleway hurriedly.\n\n“Many,” said the woman; “just outside this forest my aunt was devoured\nthree years ago, as she was coming home from market.  The horse and a\nyoung pig that was in the cart were eaten too.  The horse was a very old\none, but it was a beautiful young pig, oh, so fat.  I cried when I heard\nthat it was taken.  They spare nothing.”\n\n“They may attack us here,” said Abbleway tremulously; “they could easily\nbreak in, these carriages are like matchwood.  We may both be devoured.”\n\n“You, perhaps,” said the woman calmly; “not me.”\n\n“Why not you?” demanded Abbleway.\n\n“It is the day of Saint Mariä Kleophä, my name-day.  She would not allow\nme to be eaten by wolves on her day.  Such a thing could not be thought\nof.  You, yes, but not me.”\n\nAbbleway changed the subject.\n\n“It is only afternoon now; if we are to be left here till morning we\nshall be starving.”\n\n“I have here some good eatables,” said the woman tranquilly; “on my\nfestival day it is natural that I should have provision with me.  I have\nfive good blood-sausages; in the town shops they cost twenty-five heller\neach.  Things are dear in the town shops.”\n\n“I will give you fifty heller apiece for a couple of them,” said Abbleway\nwith some enthusiasm.\n\n“In a railway accident things become very dear,” said the woman; “these\nblood-sausages are four kronen apiece.”\n\n“Four kronen!” exclaimed Abbleway; “four kronen for a blood-sausage!”\n\n“You cannot get them any cheaper on this train,” said the woman, with\nrelentless logic, “because there aren’t any others to get.  In Agram you\ncan buy them cheaper, and in Paradise no doubt they will be given to us\nfor nothing, but here they cost four kronen each.  I have a small piece\nof Emmenthaler cheese and a honey-cake and a piece of bread that I can\nlet you have.  That will be another three kronen, eleven kronen in all.\nThere is a piece of ham, but that I cannot let you have on my name-day.”\n\nAbbleway wondered to himself what price she would have put on the ham,\nand hurried to pay her the eleven kronen before her emergency tariff\nexpanded into a famine tariff.  As he was taking possession of his modest\nstore of eatables he suddenly heard a noise which set his heart thumping\nin a miserable fever of fear.  ‘There was a scraping and shuffling as of\nsome animal or animals trying to climb up to the footboard.  In another\nmoment, through the snow-encrusted glass of the carriage window, he saw a\ngaunt prick-eared head, with gaping jaw and lolling tongue and gleaming\nteeth; a second later another head shot up.\n\n“There are hundreds of them,” whispered Abbleway; “they have scented us.\nThey will tear the carriage to pieces.  We shall be devoured.”\n\n“Not me, on my name-day.  The holy Mariä Kleophä would not permit it,”\nsaid the woman with provoking calm.\n\nThe heads dropped down from the window and an uncanny silence fell on the\nbeleaguered carriage.  Abbleway neither moved nor spoke.  Perhaps the\nbrutes had not clearly seen or winded the human occupants of the\ncarriage, and had prowled away on some other errand of rapine.\n\nThe long torture-laden minutes passed slowly away.\n\n“It grows cold,” said the woman suddenly, crossing over to the far end of\nthe carriage, where the heads had appeared.  “The heating apparatus does\nnot work any longer.  See, over there beyond the trees, there is a\nchimney with smoke coming from it.  It is not far, and the snow has\nnearly stopped, I shall find a path through the forest to that house with\nthe chimney.”\n\n“But the wolves!” exclaimed Abbleway; “they may—”\n\n“Not on my name-day,” said the woman obstinately, and before he could\nstop her she had opened the door and climbed down into the snow.  A\nmoment later he hid his face in his hands; two gaunt lean figures rushed\nupon her from the forest.  No doubt she had courted her fate, but\nAbbleway had no wish to see a human being torn to pieces and devoured\nbefore his eyes.\n\nWhen he looked at last a new sensation of scandalised astonishment took\npossession of him.  He had been straitly brought up in a small English\ntown, and he was not prepared to be the witness of a miracle.  The wolves\nwere not doing anything worse to the woman than drench her with snow as\nthey gambolled round her.\n\nA short, joyous bark revealed the clue to the situation.\n\n“Are those—dogs?” he called weakly.\n\n“My cousin Karl’s dogs, yes,” she answered; “that is his inn, over beyond\nthe trees.  I knew it was there, but I did not want to take you there; he\nis always grasping with strangers.  However, it grows too cold to remain\nin the train.  Ah, ah, see what comes!”\n\nA whistle sounded, and a relief engine made its appearance, snorting its\nway sulkily through the snow.  Abbleway did not have the opportunity for\nfinding out whether Karl was really avaricious.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LUMBER ROOM\n\n\nThe children were to be driven, as a special treat, to the sands at\nJagborough.  Nicholas was not to be of the party; he was in disgrace.\nOnly that morning he had refused to eat his wholesome bread-and-milk on\nthe seemingly frivolous ground that there was a frog in it.  Older and\nwiser and better people had told him that there could not possibly be a\nfrog in his bread-and-milk and that he was not to talk nonsense; he\ncontinued, nevertheless, to talk what seemed the veriest nonsense, and\ndescribed with much detail the colouration and markings of the alleged\nfrog.  The dramatic part of the incident was that there really was a frog\nin Nicholas’ basin of bread-and-milk; he had put it there himself, so he\nfelt entitled to know something about it.  The sin of taking a frog from\nthe garden and putting it into a bowl of wholesome bread-and-milk was\nenlarged on at great length, but the fact that stood out clearest in the\nwhole affair, as it presented itself to the mind of Nicholas, was that\nthe older, wiser, and better people had been proved to be profoundly in\nerror in matters about which they had expressed the utmost assurance.\n\n“You said there couldn’t possibly be a frog in my bread-and-milk; there\n_was_ a frog in my bread-and-milk,” he repeated, with the insistence of a\nskilled tactician who does not intend to shift from favourable ground.\n\nSo his boy-cousin and girl-cousin and his quite uninteresting younger\nbrother were to be taken to Jagborough sands that afternoon and he was to\nstay at home.  His cousins’ aunt, who insisted, by an unwarranted stretch\nof imagination, in styling herself his aunt also, had hastily invented\nthe Jagborough expedition in order to impress on Nicholas the delights\nthat he had justly forfeited by his disgraceful conduct at the\nbreakfast-table.  It was her habit, whenever one of the children fell\nfrom grace, to improvise something of a festival nature from which the\noffender would be rigorously debarred; if all the children sinned\ncollectively they were suddenly informed of a circus in a neighbouring\ntown, a circus of unrivalled merit and uncounted elephants, to which, but\nfor their depravity, they would have been taken that very day.\n\nA few decent tears were looked for on the part of Nicholas when the\nmoment for the departure of the expedition arrived.  As a matter of fact,\nhowever, all the crying was done by his girl-cousin, who scraped her knee\nrather painfully against the step of the carriage as she was scrambling\nin.\n\n“How she did howl,” said Nicholas cheerfully, as the party drove off\nwithout any of the elation of high spirits that should have characterised\nit.\n\n“She’ll soon get over that,” said the _soi-disant_ aunt; “it will be a\nglorious afternoon for racing about over those beautiful sands.  How they\nwill enjoy themselves!”\n\n“Bobby won’t enjoy himself much, and he won’t race much either,” said\nNicholas with a grim chuckle; “his boots are hurting him.  They’re too\ntight.”\n\n“Why didn’t he tell me they were hurting?” asked the aunt with some\nasperity.\n\n“He told you twice, but you weren’t listening.  You often don’t listen\nwhen we tell you important things.”\n\n“You are not to go into the gooseberry garden,” said the aunt, changing\nthe subject.\n\n“Why not?” demanded Nicholas.\n\n“Because you are in disgrace,” said the aunt loftily.\n\nNicholas did not admit the flawlessness of the reasoning; he felt\nperfectly capable of being in disgrace and in a gooseberry garden at the\nsame moment.  His face took on an expression of considerable obstinacy.\nIt was clear to his aunt that he was determined to get into the\ngooseberry garden, “only,” as she remarked to herself, “because I have\ntold him he is not to.”\n\nNow the gooseberry garden had two doors by which it might be entered, and\nonce a small person like Nicholas could slip in there he could\neffectually disappear from view amid the masking growth of artichokes,\nraspberry canes, and fruit bushes.  The aunt had many other things to do\nthat afternoon, but she spent an hour or two in trivial gardening\noperations among flower beds and shrubberies, whence she could keep a\nwatchful eye on the two doors that led to the forbidden paradise.  She\nwas a woman of few ideas, with immense powers of concentration.\n\nNicholas made one or two sorties into the front garden, wriggling his way\nwith obvious stealth of purpose towards one or other of the doors, but\nnever able for a moment to evade the aunt’s watchful eye.  As a matter of\nfact, he had no intention of trying to get into the gooseberry garden,\nbut it was extremely convenient for him that his aunt should believe that\nhe had; it was a belief that would keep her on self-imposed sentry-duty\nfor the greater part of the afternoon.  Having thoroughly confirmed and\nfortified her suspicions Nicholas slipped back into the house and rapidly\nput into execution a plan of action that had long germinated in his\nbrain.  By standing on a chair in the library one could reach a shelf on\nwhich reposed a fat, important-looking key.  The key was as important as\nit looked; it was the instrument which kept the mysteries of the\nlumber-room secure from unauthorised intrusion, which opened a way only\nfor aunts and such-like privileged persons.  Nicholas had not had much\nexperience of the art of fitting keys into keyholes and turning locks,\nbut for some days past he had practised with the key of the schoolroom\ndoor; he did not believe in trusting too much to luck and accident.  The\nkey turned stiffly in the lock, but it turned.  The door opened, and\nNicholas was in an unknown land, compared with which the gooseberry\ngarden was a stale delight, a mere material pleasure.\n\nOften and often Nicholas had pictured to himself what the lumber-room\nmight be like, that region that was so carefully sealed from youthful\neyes and concerning which no questions were ever answered.  It came up to\nhis expectations.  In the first place it was large and dimly lit, one\nhigh window opening on to the forbidden garden being its only source of\nillumination.  In the second place it was a storehouse of unimagined\ntreasures.  The aunt-by-assertion was one of those people who think that\nthings spoil by use and consign them to dust and damp by way of\npreserving them.  Such parts of the house as Nicholas knew best were\nrather bare and cheerless, but here there were wonderful things for the\neye to feast on.  First and foremost there was a piece of framed tapestry\nthat was evidently meant to be a fire-screen.  To Nicholas it was a\nliving, breathing story; he sat down on a roll of Indian hangings,\nglowing in wonderful colours beneath a layer of dust, and took in all the\ndetails of the tapestry picture.  A man, dressed in the hunting costume\nof some remote period, had just transfixed a stag with an arrow; it could\nnot have been a difficult shot because the stag was only one or two paces\naway from him; in the thickly-growing vegetation that the picture\nsuggested it would not have been difficult to creep up to a feeding stag,\nand the two spotted dogs that were springing forward to join in the chase\nhad evidently been trained to keep to heel till the arrow was discharged.\nThat part of the picture was simple, if interesting, but did the huntsman\nsee, what Nicholas saw, that four galloping wolves were coming in his\ndirection through the wood?  There might be more than four of them hidden\nbehind the trees, and in any case would the man and his dogs be able to\ncope with the four wolves if they made an attack?  The man had only two\narrows left in his quiver, and he might miss with one or both of them;\nall one knew about his skill in shooting was that he could hit a large\nstag at a ridiculously short range.  Nicholas sat for many golden minutes\nrevolving the possibilities of the scene; he was inclined to think that\nthere were more than four wolves and that the man and his dogs were in a\ntight corner.\n\nBut there were other objects of delight and interest claiming his instant\nattention: there were quaint twisted candlesticks in the shape of snakes,\nand a teapot fashioned like a china duck, out of whose open beak the tea\nwas supposed to come.  How dull and shapeless the nursery teapot seemed\nin comparison!  And there was a carved sandal-wood box packed tight with\naromatic cotton-wool, and between the layers of cotton-wool were little\nbrass figures, hump-necked bulls, and peacocks and goblins, delightful to\nsee and to handle.  Less promising in appearance was a large square book\nwith plain black covers; Nicholas peeped into it, and, behold, it was\nfull of coloured pictures of birds.  And such birds!  In the garden, and\nin the lanes when he went for a walk, Nicholas came across a few birds,\nof which the largest were an occasional magpie or wood-pigeon; here were\nherons and bustards, kites, toucans, tiger-bitterns, brush turkeys,\nibises, golden pheasants, a whole portrait gallery of undreamed-of\ncreatures.  And as he was admiring the colouring of the mandarin duck and\nassigning a life-history to it, the voice of his aunt in shrill\nvociferation of his name came from the gooseberry garden without.  She\nhad grown suspicious at his long disappearance, and had leapt to the\nconclusion that he had climbed over the wall behind the sheltering screen\nof the lilac bushes; she was now engaged in energetic and rather hopeless\nsearch for him among the artichokes and raspberry canes.\n\n“Nicholas, Nicholas!” she screamed, “you are to come out of this at once.\nIt’s no use trying to hide there; I can see you all the time.”\n\nIt was probably the first time for twenty years that anyone had smiled in\nthat lumber-room.\n\nPresently the angry repetitions of Nicholas’ name gave way to a shriek,\nand a cry for somebody to come quickly.  Nicholas shut the book, restored\nit carefully to its place in a corner, and shook some dust from a\nneighbouring pile of newspapers over it.  Then he crept from the room,\nlocked the door, and replaced the key exactly where he had found it.  His\naunt was still calling his name when he sauntered into the front garden.\n\n“Who’s calling?” he asked.\n\n“Me,” came the answer from the other side of the wall; “didn’t you hear\nme?  I’ve been looking for you in the gooseberry garden, and I’ve slipped\ninto the rain-water tank.  Luckily there’s no water in it, but the sides\nare slippery and I can’t get out.  Fetch the little ladder from under the\ncherry tree—”\n\n“I was told I wasn’t to go into the gooseberry garden,” said Nicholas\npromptly.\n\n“I told you not to, and now I tell you that you may,” came the voice from\nthe rain-water tank, rather impatiently.\n\n“Your voice doesn’t sound like aunt’s,” objected Nicholas; “you may be\nthe Evil One tempting me to be disobedient.  Aunt often tells me that the\nEvil One tempts me and that I always yield.  This time I’m not going to\nyield.”\n\n“Don’t talk nonsense,” said the prisoner in the tank; “go and fetch the\nladder.”\n\n“Will there be strawberry jam for tea?” asked Nicholas innocently.\n\n“Certainly there will be,” said the aunt, privately resolving that\nNicholas should have none of it.\n\n“Now I know that you are the Evil One and not aunt,” shouted Nicholas\ngleefully; “when we asked aunt for strawberry jam yesterday she said\nthere wasn’t any.  I know there are four jars of it in the store\ncupboard, because I looked, and of course you know it’s there, but she\ndoesn’t, because she said there wasn’t any.  Oh, Devil, you _have_ sold\nyourself!”\n\nThere was an unusual sense of luxury in being able to talk to an aunt as\nthough one was talking to the Evil One, but Nicholas knew, with childish\ndiscernment, that such luxuries were not to be over-indulged in.  He\nwalked noisily away, and it was a kitchenmaid, in search of parsley, who\neventually rescued the aunt from the rain-water tank.\n\nTea that evening was partaken of in a fearsome silence.  The tide had\nbeen at its highest when the children had arrived at Jagborough Cove, so\nthere had been no sands to play on—a circumstance that the aunt had\noverlooked in the haste of organising her punitive expedition.  The\ntightness of Bobby’s boots had had disastrous effect on his temper the\nwhole of the afternoon, and altogether the children could not have been\nsaid to have enjoyed themselves.  The aunt maintained the frozen muteness\nof one who has suffered undignified and unmerited detention in a\nrain-water tank for thirty-five minutes.  As for Nicholas, he, too, was\nsilent, in the absorption of one who has much to think about; it was just\npossible, he considered, that the huntsman would escape with his hounds\nwhile the wolves feasted on the stricken stag.\n\n\n\n\nFUR\n\n\n“You look worried, dear,” said Eleanor.\n\n“I am worried,” admitted Suzanne; “not worried exactly, but anxious.  You\nsee, my birthday happens next week—”\n\n“You lucky person,” interrupted Eleanor; “my birthday doesn’t come till\nthe end of March.”\n\n“Well, old Bertram Kneyght is over in England just now from the\nArgentine.  He’s a kind of distant cousin of my mother’s, and so\nenormously rich that we’ve never let the relationship drop out of sight.\nEven if we don’t see him or hear from him for years he is always Cousin\nBertram when he does turn up.  I can’t say he’s ever been of much solid\nuse to us, but yesterday the subject of my birthday cropped up, and he\nasked me to let him know what I wanted for a present.”\n\n“Now I understand the anxiety,” observed Eleanor.\n\n“As a rule when one is confronted with a problem like that,” said\nSuzanne, “all one’s ideas vanish; one doesn’t seem to have a desire in\nthe world.  Now it so happens that I have been very keen on a little\nDresden figure that I saw somewhere in Kensington; about thirty-six\nshillings, quite beyond my means.  I was very nearly describing the\nfigure, and giving Bertram the address of the shop.  And then it suddenly\nstruck me that thirty-six shillings was such a ridiculously inadequate\nsum for a man of his immense wealth to spend on a birthday present.  He\ncould give thirty-six pounds as easily as you or I could buy a bunch of\nviolets.  I don’t want to be greedy, of course, but I don’t like being\nwasteful.”\n\n“The question is,” said Eleanor, “what are his ideas as to\npresent-giving?  Some of the wealthiest people have curiously cramped\nviews on that subject.  When people grow gradually rich their\nrequirements and standard of living expand in proportion, while their\npresent-giving instincts often remain in the undeveloped condition of\ntheir earlier days.  Something showy and not-too-expensive in a shop is\ntheir only conception of the ideal gift.  That is why even quite good\nshops have their counters and windows crowded with things worth about\nfour shillings that look as if they might be worth seven-and-six, and are\npriced at ten shillings and labelled seasonable gifts.’”\n\n“I know,” said Suzanne; “that is why it is so risky to be vague when one\nis giving indications of one’s wants.  Now if I say to him: ‘I am going\nout to Davos this winter, so anything in the travelling line would be\nacceptable,’ he might give me a dressing-bag with gold-mounted fittings,\nbut, on the other hand, he might give me Baedeker’s Switzerland, or\n‘Skiing without Tears,’ or something of that sort.”\n\n“He would be more likely to say: ‘She’ll be going to lots of dances, a\nfan will be sure to be useful.’”\n\n“Yes, and I’ve got tons of fans, so you see where the danger and anxiety\nlies.  Now if there is one thing more than another that I really urgently\nwant it is furs.  I simply haven’t any.  I’m told that Davos is full of\nRussians, and they are sure to wear the most lovely sables and things.\nTo be among people who are smothered in furs when one hasn’t any oneself\nmakes one want to break most of the Commandments.”\n\n“If it’s furs that you’re out for,” said Eleanor, “you will have to\nsuperintend the choice of them in person.  You can’t be sure that your\ncousin knows the difference between silver-fox and ordinary squirrel.”\n\n“There are some heavenly silver-fox stoles at Goliath and Mastodon’s,”\nsaid Suzanne, with a sigh; “if I could only inveigle Bertram into their\nbuilding and take him for a stroll through the fur department!”\n\n“He lives somewhere near there, doesn’t he?” said Eleanor.  “Do you know\nwhat his habits are?  Does he take a walk at any particular time of day?”\n\n“He usually walks down to his club about three o’clock, if it’s a fine\nday.  That takes him right past Goliath and Mastodon’s.”\n\n“Let us two meet him accidentally at the street corner to-morrow,” said\nEleanor; “we can walk a little way with him, and with luck we ought to be\nable to side-track him into the shop.  You can say you want to get a\nhair-net or something.  When we’re safely there I can say: ‘I wish you’d\ntell me what you want for your birthday.’  Then you’ll have everything\nready to hand—the rich cousin, the fur department, and the topic of\nbirthday presents.”\n\n“It’s a great idea,” said Suzanne; “you really are a brick.  Come round\nto-morrow at twenty to three; don’t be late, we must carry out our ambush\nto the minute.”\n\nAt a few minutes to three the next afternoon the fur-trappers walked\nwarily towards the selected corner.  In the near distance rose the\ncolossal pile of Messrs.  Goliath and Mastodon’s famed establishment.\nThe afternoon was brilliantly fine, exactly the sort of weather to tempt\na gentleman of advancing years into the discreet exercise of a leisurely\nwalk.\n\n“I say, dear, I wish you’d do something for me this evening,” said\nEleanor to her companion; “just drop in after dinner on some pretext or\nother, and stay on to make a fourth at bridge with Adela and the aunts.\nOtherwise I shall have to play, and Harry Scarisbrooke is going to come\nin unexpectedly about nine-fifteen, and I particularly want to be free to\ntalk to him while the others are playing.”\n\n“Sorry, my dear, no can do,” said Suzanne; “ordinary bridge at\nthree-pence a hundred, with such dreadfully slow players as your aunts,\nbores me to tears.  I nearly go to sleep over it.”\n\n“But I most particularly want an opportunity to talk with Harry,” urged\nEleanor, an angry glint coming into her eyes.\n\n“Sorry, anything to oblige, but not that,” said Suzanne cheerfully; the\nsacrifices of friendship were beautiful in her eyes as long as she was\nnot asked to make them.\n\nEleanor said nothing further on the subject, but the corners of her mouth\nrearranged themselves.\n\n“There’s our man!” exclaimed Suzanne suddenly; “hurry!”\n\nMr. Bertram Kneyght greeted his cousin and her friend with genuine\nheartiness, and readily accepted their invitation to explore the crowded\nmart that stood temptingly at their elbow.  The plate-glass doors swung\nopen and the trio plunged bravely into the jostling throng of buyers and\nloiterers.\n\n“Is it always as full as this?” asked Bertram of Eleanor.\n\n“More or less, and autumn sales are on just now,” she replied.\n\nSuzanne, in her anxiety to pilot her cousin to the desired haven of the\nfur department, was usually a few paces ahead of the others, coming back\nto them now and then if they lingered for a moment at some attractive\ncounter, with the nervous solicitude of a parent rook encouraging its\nyoung ones on their first flying expedition.\n\n“It’s Suzanne’s birthday on Wednesday next,” confided Eleanor to Bertram\nKneyght at a moment when Suzanne had left them unusually far behind; “my\nbirthday comes the day before, so we are both on the look-out for\nsomething to give each other.”\n\n“Ah,” said Bertram.  “Now, perhaps you can advise me on that very point.\nI want to give Suzanne something, and I haven’t the least idea what she\nwants.”\n\n“She’s rather a problem,” said Eleanor.  “She seems to have everything\none can think of, lucky girl.  A fan is always useful; she’ll be going to\na lot of dances at Davos this winter.  Yes, I should think a fan would\nplease her more than anything.  After our birthdays are over we inspect\neach other’s muster of presents, and I always feel dreadfully humble.\nShe gets such nice things, and I never have anything worth showing.  You\nsee, none of my relations or any of the people who give me presents are\nat all well off, so I can’t expect them to do anything more than just\nremember the day with some little trifle.  Two years ago an uncle on my\nmother’s side of the family, who had come into a small legacy, promised\nme a silver-fox stole for my birthday.  I can’t tell you how excited I\nwas about it, how I pictured myself showing it off to all my friends and\nenemies.  Then just at that moment his wife died, and, of course, poor\nman, he could not be expected to think of birthday presents at such a\ntime.  He has lived abroad ever since, and I never got my fur.  Do you\nknow, to this day I can scarcely look at a silver-fox pelt in a shop\nwindow or round anyone’s neck without feeling ready to burst into tears.\nI suppose if I hadn’t had the prospect of getting one I shouldn’t feel\nthat way.  Look, there is the fan counter, on your left; you can easily\nslip away in the crowd.  Get her as nice a one as you can see—she is such\na dear, dear girl.”\n\n“Hullo, I thought I had lost you,” said Suzanne, making her way through\nan obstructive knot of shoppers.  “Where is Bertram?”\n\n“I got separated from him long ago.  I thought he was on ahead with you,”\nsaid Eleanor.  “We shall never find him in this crush.”\n\nWhich turned out to be a true prediction.\n\n“All our trouble and forethought thrown away,” said Suzanne sulkily, when\nthey had pushed their way fruitlessly through half a dozen departments.\n\n“I can’t think why you didn’t grab him by the arm,” said Eleanor; “I\nwould have if I’d known him longer, but I’d only just been introduced.\nIt’s nearly four now, we’d better have tea.”\n\nSome days later Suzanne rang Eleanor up on the telephone.\n\n“Thank you very much for the photograph frame.  It was just what I\nwanted.  Very good of you.  I say, do you know what that Kneyght person\nhas given me?  Just what you said he would—a wretched fan.  What?  Oh\nyes, quite a good enough fan in its way, but still . . .”\n\n“You must come and see what he’s given me,” came in Eleanor’s voice over\nthe ’phone.\n\n“You!  Why should he give you anything?”\n\n“Your cousin appears to be one of those rare people of wealth who take a\npleasure in giving good presents,” came the reply.\n\n“I wondered why he was so anxious to know where she lived,” snapped\nSuzanne to herself as she rang off.\n\nA cloud has arisen between the friendships of the two young women; as far\nas Eleanor is concerned the cloud has a silver-fox lining.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PHILANTHROPIST AND THE HAPPY CAT\n\n\nJocantha Bessbury was in the mood to be serenely and graciously happy.\nHer world was a pleasant place, and it was wearing one of its pleasantest\naspects.  Gregory had managed to get home for a hurried lunch and a smoke\nafterwards in the little snuggery; the lunch had been a good one, and\nthere was just time to do justice to the coffee and cigarettes.  Both\nwere excellent in their way, and Gregory was, in his way, an excellent\nhusband.  Jocantha rather suspected herself of making him a very charming\nwife, and more than suspected herself of having a first-rate dressmaker.\n\n“I don’t suppose a more thoroughly contented personality is to be found\nin all Chelsea,” observed Jocantha in allusion to herself; “except\nperhaps Attab,” she continued, glancing towards the large tabby-marked\ncat that lay in considerable ease in a corner of the divan.  “He lies\nthere, purring and dreaming, shifting his limbs now and then in an\necstasy of cushioned comfort.  He seems the incarnation of everything\nsoft and silky and velvety, without a sharp edge in his composition, a\ndreamer whose philosophy is sleep and let sleep; and then, as evening\ndraws on, he goes out into the garden with a red glint in his eyes and\nslays a drowsy sparrow.”\n\n“As every pair of sparrows hatches out ten or more young ones in the\nyear, while their food supply remains stationary, it is just as well that\nthe Attabs of the community should have that idea of how to pass an\namusing afternoon,” said Gregory.  Having delivered himself of this sage\ncomment he lit another cigarette, bade Jocantha a playfully affectionate\ngood-bye, and departed into the outer world.\n\n“Remember, dinner’s a wee bit earlier to-night, as we’re going to the\nHaymarket,” she called after him.\n\nLeft to herself, Jocantha continued the process of looking at her life\nwith placid, introspective eyes.  If she had not everything she wanted in\nthis world, at least she was very well pleased with what she had got.\nShe was very well pleased, for instance, with the snuggery, which\ncontrived somehow to be cosy and dainty and expensive all at once.  The\nporcelain was rare and beautiful, the Chinese enamels took on wonderful\ntints in the firelight, the rugs and hangings led the eye through\nsumptuous harmonies of colouring.  It was a room in which one might have\nsuitably entertained an ambassador or an archbishop, but it was also a\nroom in which one could cut out pictures for a scrap-book without feeling\nthat one was scandalising the deities of the place with one’s litter.\nAnd as with the snuggery, so with the rest of the house, and as with the\nhouse, so with the other departments of Jocantha’s life; she really had\ngood reason for being one of the most contented women in Chelsea.\n\nFrom being in a mood of simmering satisfaction with her lot she passed to\nthe phase of being generously commiserating for those thousands around\nher whose lives and circumstances were dull, cheap, pleasureless, and\nempty.  Work girls, shop assistants and so forth, the class that have\nneither the happy-go-lucky freedom of the poor nor the leisured freedom\nof the rich, came specially within the range of her sympathy.  It was sad\nto think that there were young people who, after a long day’s work, had\nto sit alone in chill, dreary bedrooms because they could not afford the\nprice of a cup of coffee and a sandwich in a restaurant, still less a\nshilling for a theatre gallery.\n\nJocantha’s mind was still dwelling on this theme when she started forth\non an afternoon campaign of desultory shopping; it would be rather a\ncomforting thing, she told herself, if she could do something, on the\nspur of the moment, to bring a gleam of pleasure and interest into the\nlife of even one or two wistful-hearted, empty-pocketed workers; it would\nadd a good deal to her sense of enjoyment at the theatre that night.  She\nwould get two upper circle tickets for a popular play, make her way into\nsome cheap tea-shop, and present the tickets to the first couple of\ninteresting work girls with whom she could casually drop into\nconversation.  She could explain matters by saying that she was unable to\nuse the tickets herself and did not want them to be wasted, and, on the\nother hand, did not want the trouble of sending them back.  On further\nreflection she decided that it might be better to get only one ticket and\ngive it to some lonely-looking girl sitting eating her frugal meal by\nherself; the girl might scrape acquaintance with her next-seat neighbour\nat the theatre and lay the foundations of a lasting friendship.\n\nWith the Fairy Godmother impulse strong upon her, Jocantha marched into a\nticket agency and selected with immense care an upper circle seat for the\n“Yellow Peacock,” a play that was attracting a considerable amount of\ndiscussion and criticism.  Then she went forth in search of a tea-shop\nand philanthropic adventure, at about the same time that Attab sauntered\ninto the garden with a mind attuned to sparrow stalking.  In a corner of\nan A.B.C. shop she found an unoccupied table, whereat she promptly\ninstalled herself, impelled by the fact that at the next table was\nsitting a young girl, rather plain of feature, with tired, listless eyes,\nand a general air of uncomplaining forlornness.  Her dress was of poor\nmaterial, but aimed at being in the fashion, her hair was pretty, and her\ncomplexion bad; she was finishing a modest meal of tea and scone, and she\nwas not very different in her way from thousands of other girls who were\nfinishing, or beginning, or continuing their teas in London tea-shops at\nthat exact moment.  The odds were enormously in favour of the supposition\nthat she had never seen the “Yellow Peacock”; obviously she supplied\nexcellent material for Jocantha’s first experiment in haphazard\nbenefaction.\n\nJocantha ordered some tea and a muffin, and then turned a friendly\nscrutiny on her neighbour with a view to catching her eye.  At that\nprecise moment the girl’s face lit up with sudden pleasure, her eyes\nsparkled, a flush came into her cheeks, and she looked almost pretty.  A\nyoung man, whom she greeted with an affectionate “Hullo, Bertie,” came up\nto her table and took his seat in a chair facing her.  Jocantha looked\nhard at the new-comer; he was in appearance a few years younger than\nherself, very much better looking than Gregory, rather better looking, in\nfact, than any of the young men of her set.  She guessed him to be a\nwell-mannered young clerk in some wholesale warehouse, existing and\namusing himself as best he might on a tiny salary, and commanding a\nholiday of about two weeks in the year.  He was aware, of course, of his\ngood looks, but with the shy self-consciousness of the Anglo-Saxon, not\nthe blatant complacency of the Latin or Semite.  He was obviously on\nterms of friendly intimacy with the girl he was talking to, probably they\nwere drifting towards a formal engagement.  Jocantha pictured the boy’s\nhome, in a rather narrow circle, with a tiresome mother who always wanted\nto know how and where he spent his evenings.  He would exchange that\nhumdrum thraldom in due course for a home of his own, dominated by a\nchronic scarcity of pounds, shillings, and pence, and a dearth of most of\nthe things that made life attractive or comfortable.  Jocantha felt\nextremely sorry for him.  She wondered if he had seen the “Yellow\nPeacock”; the odds were enormously in favour of the supposition that he\nhad not.  The girl had finished her tea and would shortly be going back\nto her work; when the boy was alone it would be quite easy for Jocantha\nto say: “My husband has made other arrangements for me this evening;\nwould you care to make use of this ticket, which would otherwise be\nwasted?”  Then she could come there again one afternoon for tea, and, if\nshe saw him, ask him how he liked the play.  If he was a nice boy and\nimproved on acquaintance he could be given more theatre tickets, and\nperhaps asked to come one Sunday to tea at Chelsea.  Jocantha made up her\nmind that he would improve on acquaintance, and that Gregory would like\nhim, and that the Fairy Godmother business would prove far more\nentertaining than she had originally anticipated.  The boy was distinctly\npresentable; he knew how to brush his hair, which was possibly an\nimitative faculty; he knew what colour of tie suited him, which might be\nintuition; he was exactly the type that Jocantha admired, which of course\nwas accident.  Altogether she was rather pleased when the girl looked at\nthe clock and bade a friendly but hurried farewell to her companion.\nBertie nodded “good-bye,” gulped down a mouthful of tea, and then\nproduced from his overcoat pocket a paper-covered book, bearing the title\n“Sepoy and Sahib, a tale of the great Mutiny.”\n\nThe laws of tea-shop etiquette forbid that you should offer theatre\ntickets to a stranger without having first caught the stranger’s eye.  It\nis even better if you can ask to have a sugar basin passed to you, having\npreviously concealed the fact that you have a large and well-filled sugar\nbasin on your own table; this is not difficult to manage, as the printed\nmenu is generally nearly as large as the table, and can be made to stand\non end.  Jocantha set to work hopefully; she had a long and rather\nhigh-pitched discussion with the waitress concerning alleged defects in\nan altogether blameless muffin, she made loud and plaintive inquiries\nabout the tube service to some impossibly remote suburb, she talked with\nbrilliant insincerity to the tea-shop kitten, and as a last resort she\nupset a milk-jug and swore at it daintily.  Altogether she attracted a\ngood deal of attention, but never for a moment did she attract the\nattention of the boy with the beautifully-brushed hair, who was some\nthousands of miles away in the baking plains of Hindostan, amid deserted\nbungalows, seething bazaars, and riotous barrack squares, listening to\nthe throbbing of tom-toms and the distant rattle of musketry.\n\nJocantha went back to her house in Chelsea, which struck her for the\nfirst time as looking dull and over-furnished.  She had a resentful\nconviction that Gregory would be uninteresting at dinner, and that the\nplay would be stupid after dinner.  On the whole her frame of mind showed\na marked divergence from the purring complacency of Attab, who was again\ncurled up in his corner of the divan with a great peace radiating from\nevery curve of his body.\n\nBut then he had killed his sparrow.\n\n\n\n\nON APPROVAL\n\n\nOf all the genuine Bohemians who strayed from time to time into the\nwould-be Bohemian circle of the Restaurant Nuremberg, Owl Street, Soho,\nnone was more interesting and more elusive than Gebhard Knopfschrank.  He\nhad no friends, and though he treated all the restaurant frequenters as\nacquaintances he never seemed to wish to carry the acquaintanceship\nbeyond the door that led into Owl Street and the outer world.  He dealt\nwith them all rather as a market woman might deal with chance passers-by,\nexhibiting her wares and chattering about the weather and the slackness\nof business, occasionally about rheumatism, but never showing a desire to\npenetrate into their daily lives or to dissect their ambitions.\n\nHe was understood to belong to a family of peasant farmers, somewhere in\nPomerania; some two years ago, according to all that was known of him, he\nhad abandoned the labours and responsibilities of swine tending and goose\nrearing to try his fortune as an artist in London.\n\n“Why London and not Paris or Munich?” he had been asked by the curious.\n\nWell, there was a ship that left Stolpmünde for London twice a month,\nthat carried few passengers, but carried them cheaply; the railway fares\nto Munich or Paris were not cheap.  Thus it was that he came to select\nLondon as the scene of his great adventure.\n\nThe question that had long and seriously agitated the frequenters of the\nNuremberg was whether this goose-boy migrant was really a soul-driven\ngenius, spreading his wings to the light, or merely an enterprising young\nman who fancied he could paint and was pardonably anxious to escape from\nthe monotony of rye bread diet and the sandy, swine-bestrewn plains of\nPomerania.  There was reasonable ground for doubt and caution; the\nartistic groups that foregathered at the little restaurant contained so\nmany young women with short hair and so many young men with long hair,\nwho supposed themselves to be abnormally gifted in the domain of music,\npoetry, painting, or stagecraft, with little or nothing to support the\nsupposition, that a self-announced genius of any sort in their midst was\ninevitably suspect.  On the other hand, there was the ever-imminent\ndanger of entertaining, and snubbing, an angel unawares.  There had been\nthe lamentable case of Sledonti, the dramatic poet, who had been\nbelittled and cold-shouldered in the Owl Street hall of judgment, and had\nbeen afterwards hailed as a master singer by the Grand Duke Constantine\nConstantinovitch—“the most educated of the Romanoffs,” according to\nSylvia Strubble, who spoke rather as one who knew every individual member\nof the Russian imperial family; as a matter of fact, she knew a newspaper\ncorrespondent, a young man who ate _bortsch_ with the air of having\ninvented it.  Sledonti’s “Poems of Death and Passion” were now being sold\nby the thousand in seven European languages, and were about to be\ntranslated into Syrian, a circumstance which made the discerning critics\nof the Nuremberg rather shy of maturing their future judgments too\nrapidly and too irrevocably.\n\nAs regards Knopfschrank’s work, they did not lack opportunity for\ninspecting and appraising it.  However resolutely he might hold himself\naloof from the social life of his restaurant acquaintances, he was not\nminded to hide his artistic performances from their inquiring gaze.\nEvery evening, or nearly every evening, at about seven o’clock, he would\nmake his appearance, sit himself down at his accustomed table, throw a\nbulky black portfolio on to the chair opposite him, nod round\nindiscriminately at his fellow-guests, and commence the serious business\nof eating and drinking.  When the coffee stage was reached he would light\na cigarette, draw the portfolio over to him, and begin to rummage among\nits contents.  With slow deliberation he would select a few of his more\nrecent studies and sketches, and silently pass them round from table to\ntable, paying especial attention to any new diners who might be present.\nOn the back of each sketch was marked in plain figures the announcement\n“Price ten shillings.”\n\nIf his work was not obviously stamped with the hall-mark of genius, at\nany rate it was remarkable for its choice of an unusual and unvarying\ntheme.  His pictures always represented some well-known street or public\nplace in London, fallen into decay and denuded of its human population,\nin the place of which there roamed a wild fauna, which, from its wealth\nof exotic species, must have originally escaped from Zoological Gardens\nand travelling beast shows.  “Giraffes drinking at the fountain pools,\nTrafalgar Square,” was one of the most notable and characteristic of his\nstudies, while even more sensational was the gruesome picture of\n“Vultures attacking dying camel in Upper Berkeley Street.”  There were\nalso photographs of the large canvas on which he had been engaged for\nsome months, and which he was now endeavouring to sell to some\nenterprising dealer or adventurous amateur.  The subject was “Hyænas\nasleep in Euston Station,” a composition that left nothing to be desired\nin the way of suggesting unfathomed depths of desolation.\n\n“Of course it may be immensely clever, it may be something epoch-making\nin the realm of art,” said Sylvia Strubble to her own particular circle\nof listeners, “but, on the other hand, it may be merely mad.  One mustn’t\npay too much attention to the commercial aspect of the case, of course,\nbut still, if some dealer would make a bid for that hyæna picture, or\neven for some of the sketches, we should know better how to place the man\nand his work.”\n\n“We may all be cursing ourselves one of these days,” said Mrs.\nNougat-Jones, “for not having bought up his entire portfolio of sketches.\nAt the same time, when there is so much real talent going about, one does\nnot feel like planking down ten shillings for what looks like a bit of\nwhimsical oddity.  Now that picture that he showed us last week,\n‘Sand-grouse roosting on the Albert Memorial,’ was very impressive, and\nof course I could see there was good workmanship in it and breadth of\ntreatment; but it didn’t in the least convey the Albert Memorial to me,\nand Sir James Beanquest tells me that sand-grouse don’t roost, they sleep\non the ground.”\n\nWhatever talent or genius the Pomeranian artist might possess, it\ncertainly failed to receive commercial sanction.  The portfolio remained\nbulky with unsold sketches, and the “Euston Siesta,” as the wits of the\nNuremberg nicknamed the large canvas, was still in the market.  The\noutward and visible signs of financial embarrassment began to be\nnoticeable; the half-bottle of cheap claret at dinner-time gave way to a\nsmall glass of lager, and this in turn was displaced by water.  The\none-and-sixpenny set dinner receded from an everyday event to a Sunday\nextravagance; on ordinary days the artist contented himself with a\nsevenpenny omelette and some bread and cheese, and there were evenings\nwhen he did not put in an appearance at all.  On the rare occasions when\nhe spoke of his own affairs it was observed that he began to talk more\nabout Pomerania and less about the great world of art.\n\n“It is a busy time there now with us,” he said wistfully; “the schwines\nare driven out into the fields after harvest, and must be looked after.\nI could be helping to look after if I was there.  Here it is difficult to\nlive; art is not appreciate.”\n\n“Why don’t you go home on a visit?” some one asked tactfully.\n\n“Ah, it cost money!  There is the ship passage to Stolpmünde, and there\nis money that I owe at my lodgings.  Even here I owe a few schillings.\nIf I could sell some of my sketches—”\n\n“Perhaps,” suggested Mrs. Nougat-Jones, “if you were to offer them for a\nlittle less, some of us would be glad to buy a few.  Ten shillings is\nalways a consideration, you know, to people who are not over well off.\nPerhaps if you were to ask six or seven shillings—”\n\nOnce a peasant, always a peasant.  The mere suggestion of a bargain to be\nstruck brought a twinkle of awakened alertness into the artist’s eyes,\nand hardened the lines of his mouth.\n\n“Nine schilling nine pence each,” he snapped, and seemed disappointed\nthat Mrs. Nougat-Jones did not pursue the subject further.  He had\nevidently expected her to offer seven and fourpence.\n\nThe weeks sped by, and Knopfschrank came more rarely to the restaurant in\nOwl Street, while his meals on those occasions became more and more\nmeagre.  And then came a triumphal day, when he appeared early in the\nevening in a high state of elation, and ordered an elaborate meal that\nscarcely stopped short of being a banquet.  The ordinary resources of the\nkitchen were supplemented by an imported dish of smoked goosebreast, a\nPomeranian delicacy that was luckily procurable at a firm of\n_delikatessen_ merchants in Coventry Street, while a long-necked bottle\nof Rhine wine gave a finishing touch of festivity and good cheer to the\ncrowded table.\n\n“He has evidently sold his masterpiece,” whispered Sylvia Strubble to\nMrs. Nougat-Jones, who had come in late.\n\n“Who has bought it?” she whispered back.\n\n“Don’t know; he hasn’t said anything yet, but it must be some American.\nDo you see, he has got a little American flag on the dessert dish, and he\nhas put pennies in the music box three times, once to play the\n‘Star-spangled Banner,’ then a Sousa march, and then the ‘Star-spangled\nBanner’ again.  It must be an American millionaire, and he’s evidently\ngot a very big price for it; he’s just beaming and chuckling with\nsatisfaction.”\n\n“We must ask him who has bought it,” said Mrs. Nougat-Jones.\n\n“Hush! no, don’t.  Let’s buy some of his sketches, quick, before we are\nsupposed to know that he’s famous; otherwise he’ll be doubling the\nprices.  I am so glad he’s had a success at last.  I always believed in\nhim, you know.”\n\nFor the sum of ten shillings each Miss Strubble acquired the drawings of\nthe camel dying in Upper Berkeley Street and of the giraffes quenching\ntheir thirst in Trafalgar Square; at the same price Mrs. Nougat-Jones\nsecured the study of roosting sand-grouse.  A more ambitious picture,\n“Wolves and wapiti fighting on the steps of the Athenæum Club,” found a\npurchaser at fifteen shillings.\n\n“And now what are your plans?” asked a young man who contributed\noccasional paragraphs to an artistic weekly.\n\n“I go back to Stolpmünde as soon as the ship sails,” said the artist,\n“and I do not return.  Never.”\n\n“But your work?  Your career as painter?”\n\n“Ah, there is nossing in it.  One starves.  Till to-day I have sold not\none of my sketches.  To-night you have bought a few, because I am going\naway from you, but at other times, not one.”\n\n“But has not some American—?”\n\n“Ah, the rich American,” chuckled the artist.  “God be thanked.  He dash\nhis car right into our herd of schwines as they were being driven out to\nthe fields.  Many of our best schwines he killed, but he paid all\ndamages.  He paid perhaps more than they were worth, many times more than\nthey would have fetched in the market after a month of fattening, but he\nwas in a hurry to get on to Dantzig.  When one is in a hurry one must pay\nwhat one is asked.  God be thanked for rich Americans, who are always in\na hurry to get somewhere else.  My father and mother, they have now so\nplenty of money; they send me some to pay my debts and come home.  I\nstart on Monday for Stolpmünde and I do not come back.  Never.”\n\n“But your picture, the hyænas?”\n\n“No good.  It is too big to carry to Stolpmünde.  I burn it.”\n\nIn time he will be forgotten, but at present Knopfschrank is almost as\nsore a subject as Sledonti with some of the frequenters of the Nuremberg\nRestaurant, Owl Street, Soho."
