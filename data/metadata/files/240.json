A neighbor happened\nto be walking by just as the man tossed a shovel full down the road\nthe opposite way the man used to drive in and out.  \"I see you\naren't messing up the part of the road you use,\" sneered the neighbor.\n\nA few minutes later another neighbor happened by and saw the\nman toss a shovel full of gravel down the other part of the road.  \"I\nsee you are fixing only the part of the road you use, and not the\npart others must use,\" sneered the second neighbor.\n\nThe shoveler stood still with a shovel full of gravel as the\nsecond man left.  Now unsure of what to do with it that would be\nagreeable to his neighbors, he decided simply to dump it out onto\nhis driveway on the very spot whence he had scooped it up.  Just as\nhe did so, a third neighbor happened to be walking by.  \"I see you\nare stealing gravel from the road for your driveway,\" sneered the\nthird man.  \"People like you are what's wrong with this country.\"\n\nAt this point the homeowner put his shovel away and sat down\nwith his pipe to contemplate these occurrences.  Pretty soon a\nneighbor from further down the street drove by and saw the man\nsitting down enjoying his pipe.  \"If you weren't so lazy, you'd\nshovel some of that gravel off your driveway and back onto the road\nwhere it belongs,\" the driver sneered as he drove away, spinning his\ntires and scattering gravel in every direction.\n\n\n\n\nA Good Horse and a Better\n\nA man once came upon a lad about midday skipping stones across\na pond.  \"Hello, young man,\" he said, approaching.  \"What brings you\nhere on a school day?\"\n\n\"I wrote a poem yesterday which was the best in class, and the\nteacher said I could play today while the other children wrote\nmore poems.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you are to be congratulated.  Yours is certainly a\ndeed of distinction.  And as a reward,\" he added, settling himself\non a tree stump, \"let me tell you a story about two horses.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, do,\" the youth said eagerly, sitting down at the\nman's feet.\n\n\"The first horse lived in Arabia, and he was beautiful and\nstrong.  He had never lost a race.  And he was shrewd.  He would\nrun just hard enough to pull away from the other horses in the race,\nand then he would let up and trot, or even walk, across the finish\nline, to the great embarrassment and humiliation of all the\nother horses.\"\n\n\"He was clearly a superior animal,\" the young poet interjected.\n\n\"Yes, he was,\" agreed the man.  \"Now the other horse lived in\nMacedonia, and he, too, was strong and noble.  He had, however, lost\none race, the first race of his life; and some say he always\nremembered that when he ran.\"\n\n\"How grating to the heart it must be to lose so early and have\na blight on one's reputation,\" mused the young man.\n\n\"But this horse always won every other race.  And unlike our\nfirst horse, when this Macedonian horse ran and knew he had beaten\nthe other horses, instead of letting up he redoubled his efforts and\nran even harder--as hard as he could--for he now ran not against the\nfortuitous competitors with whom he began the race, but against his\nown heart: against all horses past and all horses future, against\nevery horse in Macedonia and every one in Arabia, and also against\nthe ideal horse with a pace so frighteningly fast that few can\nconceive its possibility.  And even more than this, he ran toward\nthe perfection of excellence itself.  And when he crossed the\nfinish line, as happy as he was to win, he secretly lamented that\nhis opponents had not been fast enough to threaten him and push\nhim onward.\"\n\n\"Even though he lost once,\" the lad remarked after a short\nsilence, \"perhaps this horse was as good as the Arabian.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so, my child,\" said the man, with a smile.  \"Perhaps so.\"\n\n\n\n\nIt's Nut Valuable\n\nOnce upon a time a wise and thoughtful craftsman made a new\nelectric adding machine.  It was very complex with many gears and\nlevers and wheels, and it did amazing things, always adding up the\nnumbers correctly.  So the craftsman sold it to a businessman for\nmany thousands of dollars.  All the parts inside the new adding\nmachine felt good about being so valuable.  They worked hard and\nhappily all day, and often talked about how useful they were to\nthe businessman.\n\nBut one day a spring noticed a little nut just sitting on\nthe end of a shaft.  The spring pulled at the lever he was\nattached to and pointed.  Soon the whole works knew.  \"You lazy\nlittle nut,\" said a spinning gear, \"why don't you get to work?\"\n\n\"But I am working,\" said the nut.  \"Holding on is my job.\"\n\n\"That's stupid,\" yelled a cam.  \"I don't believe our maker put\nyou here.  You just sneaked in to steal some of our glory.  Why don't\nyou get out?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the nut, \"I'm sure our maker knew what he was\ndoing, and that I do serve a purpose.  I hold on as tightly as I\ncan.\" But all the machinery began to squeal and abuse the nut so\nviolently that he felt very sad and began to doubt himself.\n\"Maybe I am useless,\" he thought.  He appealed to the shaft he was\nthreaded onto.\n\n\"Look, kid,\" the shaft told him, \"I've got plenty of other\nparts holding on to me.  I shouldn't have to support you, too.\"\n\nSo finally the little nut decided to unscrew himself and go\naway.  He dropped off the shaft and fell through a hole in the\nbottom of the machine.  \"Good riddance,\" said the motor.\n\n\"Yeah, good riddance,\" all the other parts agreed.\n\nRather quickly the nut was forgotten and things went on as they\nhad for awhile.  But in a few hours, the shaft began to feel funny.\nAt first he began to vibrate.  Then he started sliding and slipping.\nHe called for help to the other parts attached to him, but they\ncould do nothing.  Presently the shaft fell completely out of his\nmounting hole, causing many levers and gears and cams to slip out\nof alignment and crash against each other, and forcing the whole\nmachine to grind to a halt with an awful noise.  The motor tried\nhis best to keep things going--he tried so hard that he bent many\nof the parts--and then as he tried even harder, he burned himself\nout.  \"This is all the fault of that little nut,\" the ruined parts\nall agreed.\n\n\"I'll give ya three bucks for it,\" said the junk man to the\noffice manager.\n\n\n\n\nStewardship\n\nA wise man approached three young men standing around idly.\n\"Here is a coin worth a hundred dollars,\" the wise man said to the\nfirst youth.  \"What should I do with it?\"\n\n\"Give it to me,\" he said at once.\n\n\"Rather than reward such selfishness and greed,\" responded the\nwise man, \"it would be better to throw the money into the sea.\"  And\nwith this, the wise man threw the coin into the water.  \"Now,\" he\nsaid to the second youth, \"here is another coin.  What should I do\nwith it?\"\n\nThe second youth, feeling shrewd, answered, \"Throw it into the sea.\"\n\nBut the wise man said, \"That would be a careless waste.  To\nfollow a bad example only because it is an example is folly.  Better\nthan throwing this money away would be to give it to the poor.\"  And\nhe gave the money to a beggar sitting nearby.  \"I have one last\ncoin,\" the wise man went on, talking to the third youth.  \"What\nshall I do with it?\"\n\nThe third youth had been paying attention, and, thinking he\nwould get the money if he avoided the greed and wastefulness implied\nin the answers of his friends, said, \"Why, give it to the poor.\"\n\n\"That is a very wise and kind answer,\" said the wise man,\nsmiling.  And because you have answered so well\" (at this the youth\nbrightened with expectation), \"I will indeed take your good advice\nand give the money to the poor.\"\n\n\"Don't I get anything for my wisdom?\" demanded the youth.\n\n\"You have already received something much better than money,\"\nsaid the wise man.\n\n\n\n\nThe Man Who Believed in Miracles\n\nOnce upon a time a traveler arrived in a land quite like our\nown, full of modern technology like cars and computers and whistling\nteapots, but with these two differences: there were no television\nsets and no airplanes.  In fact, nothing at all had ever been seen\nin the sky, not even a bird, and the only movies the people ever saw\nwere in the theaters.\n\nThe traveler stayed for about a month on the eastern shore where\nhe had arrived, and then decided to visit the western cities.  He\nmentioned his decision one evening at a meeting of the principal\nscientists and educators of the region, who had gathered to hear of\nhis travels.  Someone mentioned that the west had much to offer, but\nthat the journey between the two areas was unpleasant, consisting of\ncrossing a hot, empty desert.  \"In that case,\" said the traveler,\n\"I'll just fly.\"\n\n\"Is that like sleep?\" one of the scientists asked.\n\n\"No, no,\" the traveler replied.  \"You know, fly through the air,\nlike a bird.\"\n\n\"And what is a bird?\" someone asked.  And so the traveler began\nto explain about flight and what an airplane was and how it flew from\none place to another.  The room became very quiet, and the\nexpressions on the faces of everyone present darkened.\n\n\"Does he expect us to believe this?\" one man whispered to another.\n\n\"Well, you know what liars travelers are,\" someone else added.\nFinally the host spoke up, slightly embarrassed and slightly indignant.\n\n\"If this is your idea of a joke,\" he began, but was interrupted\nby the surprised traveler.\n\n\"Why, it's no joke at all.  People fly all the time.\"\n\n\"I am sorry that you so much underestimate the intelligence and\nlearning of your audience,\" said a professor across the table.  \"That\na person could enter some metal device--like a car with fins--and\nrise into the air, and be sustained there, and move forward, why that\nclearly violates everything we know about the law of gravity and the\nlaws of physics.  If we have learned anything from a thousand years\nof study of the natural world, it is that an object heavier than air\nmust return immediately to earth when it is tossed into the sky.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear,\" two or three people muttered.\n\n\"Now, if you perhaps mean that these 'airplanes,' as you call\nthem, are somehow flung into the air for a short distance and then\nfall to the ground, well, then perhaps that would be possible.\"  The\nprofessor looked expectantly and a bit condescendingly at the\ntraveler, hoping that the man would take this face-saving opportunity.\n\n\"No, no.  You don't understand,\" said the traveler.  \"The\nairplanes have powerful motors and the craft rise into the air, and\nthey stay up as long as they want, as long as the fuel holds out.\"\nThere were several audible \"hmmphs\" around the room.\n\n\"Tell us then,\" said another scholar, in a saccharine voice,\n\"how this device works.  What makes it fly?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know exactly how it works.  It has something to\ndo with air flowing over the wings.\"\n\n\"You don't know--you cannot explain--how it works, this device\nthat runs counter to everything we know about the natural world, yet\nyou believe in it anyway.\"\n\n\"Believe in it?\" asked the traveler, a bit confused by this\nturn of phrase.  \"Of course I 'believe in it.' I fly on one all the\ntime at home.\"\n\n\"And how do you control its motions?\" a man asked, without\nremoving his pipe.  The audience was clearly beginning to patronize\nthe traveler, and he was growing a little irritated.\n\n\"Oh, I don't control it.  There's a pilot for that.\"\n\n\"I see,\" the pipe smoker said.  \"So this airplane contains both\nyou and the pilot.  You're telling us that perhaps four or five\nhundred pounds of dead weight can travel through the air as long\nas it wants.\"\n\n\"As long as the fuel holds out,\" added one of the hmmphers,\nwith amusement.\n\n\"And all the time sneering at the law of gravity and laughing\nscience in the face,\" someone else noted.\n\n\"Well, actually, the planes are much larger than that,\" said\nthe traveler.  \"Many of them hold two or three hundred people and\nweigh, my, I don't know--many thousands of pounds.\"\n\n\"I think we have heard enough,\" the now-fully-embarrassed\nand half-angered host said.  \"It was amusing for awhile, but it's\ntime to put an end to this nonsense.\"\n\n\"It is not nonsense,\" the traveler protested.  \"It is the truth.\"\n\n\"Then you really believe this madman's drivel you've been\nfeeding us?\" the host asked, rather hotly.\n\n\"Of course.  How can I not believe it?  I see it and live it\nevery day.  And here,\" he added, remembering something, \"I even\nhave a photograph.\"\n\n\"Obviously faked,\" said the host, dismissing it after a glance.\n\n\"Who invited this charlatan?\" someone asked of no one in particular.\n\n\"I thought science had put an end to all this miraculous event\nstuff long ago,\" said another man, rising from his chair and\npreparing to leave.\n\n\"Well, let's not pursue this pointless discussion,\" the\nhost said.  \"Our guest apparently knows nothing of science, and\nis impervious to logic and to the considered opinion of the best\nminds of our nation.  There's nothing left to do but adjourn.\"\nThe meeting began to break up, and the traveler was putting on\nhis coat when the man with the pipe made one last attempt to\nreason with him.\n\n\"We are all scientists here, all educated men.  All of us\nagree that it is impossible for a heavier-than-air device to\nfly on its own through the air.  Don't you see that?  This is\nagainst the laws of nature--it violates the law of gravity.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the traveler, \"perhaps there is another law,\nor perhaps there is a higher law than the law of gravity,\nwhich, when it is understood, will explain how planes can fly.\"\n\n\"That's just what I'd expect a religious fanatic to say,\"\nsaid a man who had been listening in.  \"Science can jump\ninto the trash as far as you religious types are concerned.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said the traveler.  \"But your science is not\nperfect.  You do not yet know everything about everything, what\nis possible and what is not possible.\"\n\n\"Go take your religion to a church and keep it away from\nserious people,\" the man concluded, stomping out of the room.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, the traveler was ridiculed\nand denounced in the newspapers, being called everything from a\ncon artist to a prospective mental patient.  (The scientific\njournals said nothing about the man because they considered the\nwhole matter as beneath serious thought.)  As a result, the\ntraveler was often left to himself, and so he pulled out his\ntiny portable television set and began to watch it.  Just by\nchance, some visitors happened to come by and see the little\nbox.  They were very impressed and urged the traveler to market\nhis invention for putting a movie inside such a small space.\n\nIn a few days, word had spread about this mini-movie and\nseveral scientists were convinced (after some debate) to come see\nit, together with some engineers representing the movie projector\nmanufacturers of the nation.\n\nThey were sufficiently impressed as they watched a few scenes,\nbut when the traveler changed channels, their enthusiasm turned to\ngaping astonishment.  The traveler switched all around, showing\nthem twenty channels in all.  Such was the amazement and even\nincredulity of the engineers that they already began to suspect\nsome kind of trick.  The scientists looked confused.\n\n\"You certainly have a lot of films stored in that little\nbox,\" one of the engineers said.  \"How do you get them all in there?\"\n\n\"The pictures are not in the box,\" said the traveler.  \"They\nare all over in the air around us.  This antenna brings them in\nand the set makes them visible.\"  The engineers laughed while the\nscientists sneered, the latter now sorry they had allowed themselves\nto be talked into coming to hear this notorious nut.\n\n\"Come now,\" one of the scientists said.  \"Do you expect us\nto believe that there are pictures floating around us in the\nair--pictures we cannot see?  And that twenty sets of these pictures\nare all present at once, scrambled together, just waiting for that\nlittle box to take them and sort them out?  What do you take us for\nanyway--a bunch of gullible greenhorn fools?\"\n\n\"And besides,\" continued an engineer, \"how do these pictures\nget into the air in the first place?  Where do they come from?\"\n\n\"They're sent from a satellite in the sky,\" the traveler\nsaid, as all heads looked up.  \"You can't see it, of course.\nIt's too high.  But it's there.\"\n\n\"And of course you expect us to believe in something we can't\nsee,\" said one of the scientists, with a touch of scorn.\n\n\"Believe it because of its effects--the results--the\nevidence of its existence,\" the traveler said.  \"If it weren't\nthere, you would see no pictures.\"\n\n\"We know you're lying,\" another engineer said.  \"Even if there\nwere a device in the sky, held up by a balloon or whatever, it\ncouldn't send a signal down here without a wire.  That would be\nagainst everything we know about electricity.  And I don't see\nany wire.\"\n\n\"Well, it doesn't use a wire,\" said the traveler.  \"The\nsignals are sent through the air.  And the satellite isn't\nheld up by a balloon; it stays up because it's high enough\nso that gravity doesn't pull it down.\"\n\n\"Now he's denying the law of gravity again,\" said one of the\nscientists.  \"Let's go.  I've heard enough.  Whatever he does to\nperform his little trick, he isn't telling us about it, so let's\njust leave.\"\n\n\"Yeah, let's get out of here,\" another scientist said.  \"Every\ntime we catch him in an impossibility, he tells us the explanation\nis in the sky.\"  Then turning to the traveler to say goodbye, he\nadded, \"We cannot believe something when the weight of scientific\nevidence is against it.\"\n\n\"But when the physical evidence is clearly before you,\" said\nthe traveler, \"how can you not believe, even if your theories cannot\nexplain it?\"\n\n\"Because such an event would be a miracle, and science has\nnothing to do with miracles.\"\n\n\"Then perhaps science is the poorer for it,\" said the\ntraveler, sitting down to watch his television, which just then\nhappened to be showing a dove flying silently across the sky.\n\n\n\n\nA Fish Story\n\nThe bright sun and the gentle wind had made the little fish\nalmost bold that summer day, enough so that they were swimming all\nover the pond, from their home in the reeds at one end to the rocky\nbeach at the other.  Or at least they swam very near to the rocky\nbeach--as near as they dared--for all the older fish constantly\nwarned them to stay away.  Some of the dangers were clear enough,\nsuch as the wading birds who stepped into the shallow water, hoping\nto pluck out a little fish and swallow him right down, and the\nfoxes, whose gigantic teeth were too awful even to think about.  But\nthere were other evils that were not so distinct.  Hideous and\nunimaginable these were, with tales of fish swimming into the area\nand never to be heard from again, vague reports of sudden\ndisappearances, and some hysterical tales, impossible to make sense\nof, of leaping shadows, wild splashings, worms flying through the\nwater, and such like.\n\nThe dangers of the rocky beach could not quite be isolated in\nthe minds of the little fish, so that they felt a general sense of\nimpending doom whenever they swam more than a few feet from home.\nThat is why, one day when three little fish met each other suddenly\namong the reeds, they were all momentarily startled.  But soon they\nbegan talking and relaxed a little.  \"This is a wonderful pond,\"\nsaid one.  \"It's so big.  But I've never been this far away from\nhome before.\"\n\n\"Me either,\" said another.  \"I just hope we're safe here\nin these reeds.\"\n\n\"I do too,\" agreed the third.  \"You never know where an enemy\nmay come from.\"\n\n\"And you can't be too careful,\" added the first.\n\n\"By the way,\" said one, \"my name is Swimmy Fish.  What's yours?\"\n\n\"Finny Fish,\" said another.\n\n\"I'm Chirpy Bird,\" said the third.\n\nSwimmy Fish and Finny Fish gave a start, looked at each other\nwith surprise and terror, and then swam off in opposite directions\nas fast as they could.  \"Wait!\" cried Chirpy Bird.  \"What's wrong?\nCome back!\"  He looked around anxiously, himself frightened by their\nfright, though he could see no sign of danger anywhere.  But their\nfear hung over the area, so he decided to swim toward home, at more\nthan his usual speed.\n\nHe had not gone very far when he saw several adult fish swimming\ntoward him with serious and half-frightened expressions on their faces.\nWhen they saw him, they stopped at a distance.  \"Stop there,\" one of\nthem demanded, so Chirpy Bird stopped.  The big fish seemed to be\nengaged in a solemn discussion.  Every once in awhile one of them\nwaved a fin or glanced in his direction.  Finally, two of the largest\nfish approached a little nearer.  \"Don't make any sudden moves,\" the\nlargest one, whose name was Glubber Fish, said with a mixture of\ncommand and pleading.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" the little fish said, bewildered.\n\n\"Are you Chirpy Bird?\" asked Glubber Fish.\n\n\"Yes.  I--\"\n\n\"You must leave the pond.\"  It was a tone of finality.\n\n\"But why?\" asked Chirpy Bird.\n\n\"Because you'll soon be eating us and our children.  Besides,\nbirds don't live under water.\"\n\n\"But I'm not a bird,\" Chirpy Bird protested.\n\n\"What's your name?\" demanded the other, who was called Spotted Fish.\n\n\"Chirpy Bird.  But--\"\n\n\"There you are,\" he said, with a tone of satisfaction.\n\n\"My name is Chirpy Bird,\" said the little one, \"but I'm a fish.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" grumped Spotted Fish.  \"Whoever heard of a fish\nnamed Chirpy Bird?\"\n\n\"Whether you've heard of me or not, here I am,\" said Chirpy\nBird, not knowing what else to say.\n\n\"Totally illogical,\" interrupted Whisker Fish, who had just come near.\n\n\"As well as disrespectful and impudent,\" added Glubber fish.\n\n\"You must listen to reason,\" said Whisker Fish, self-importantly\nbrushing himself in preparation.  \"And here it is: You are Chirpy\nBird; granted.  Birds eat fish; granted.  Therefore, you eat fish.\"\n\n\"But--\" Chirpy Bird tried to explain.\n\n\"There is no 'but.'  It's a syllogism, and cannot be answered.\nThe conclusion follows necessarily,\" said Whisker Fish.  \"It's\npure logic.\"\n\n\"And it also follows,\" said Glubber fish, \"that you must leave\nthe pond.\"\n\n\"I'll die if I leave the pond,\" said Chirpy Bird.\n\n\"That's not our problem,\" said Glubber Fish.\n\n\"And it's an irrelevant objection,\" added Whisker Fish.  The\nrest of the adult fish had gradually been easing forward during\nthis conversation and now, at the direction of Glubber Fish, the\nwhole group escorted Chirpy Bird down toward the rocky beach.  In\na few minutes they reached a low spot near a weeping willow,\nwhere several of the large fish grabbed Chirpy Bird and threw him\nonto the shore.\n\n\"Now fly away and leave us alone,\" one of them said.  And leave\nthem alone he did.\n\n\n\n\nMan\n\nSomewhere in a deep, tropical jungle lived a tribe of natives with\nextremely odd behavior.  Generations ago the tribe had in some\nobscure fashion contracted a parasite which induced a seemingly\npermanent delirium in each native, and which was passed on to\nsubsequent generations.  The delirium increased with age, and most\nof the adult natives showed it by eating dirt, sleeping on dunghills,\npummeling anthills with rocks even as the ants bit them severely, and\njumping out of trees onto their heads.  This last maneuver caused the\nnatives to stagger around senseless for days, or simply to lie\nunconscious and bleeding in the sun and rain.  All these symptoms\ntogether prevented the natives from caring for their personal lives,\nand so they lived in deplorable squalor, with their huts falling\napart, and their children and themselves half starved and wholly naked.\n\nAnother odd effect of the mental distraction was an unnatural craving\nfor firewood.  Unlike the other natives in the area, the members of\nthis tribe collected--and stole, and cheated and betrayed for--log upon\nstick to pile next to their huts, even though in twenty very cold years\nthey couldn't use half as much as they already possessed.  A few\nnatives had been crushed to death by collapsing woodpiles; many more\nhad died from fighting over decidedly unimpressive old branches.\n\nOne day a doctor came from the East to the village, and he immediately\nrecognized the symptoms of the disease (a common one) for which he\ncarried the cure.  He went gladly and confidently to the chief of the\ntribe and announced his ability to remedy the ills of the people,\nexpecting to be praised and welcomed for his offer of help.  To his\nsurprise, however, the chief rebuffed him with contempt and asserted\nboldly that there was nothing at all wrong with his people, that they\nhad always acted that way since he could remember, that it was the\nhuman condition, and that they were all perfectly happy.  Then,\nafter ordering the doctor to leave immediately, the chief jumped\nout of a tree into the tribal latrine and was unavailable for any\nfurther discussion.\n\nSubstantially taken aback but firm in his resolution, the doctor\ndecided to take his offer directly to the natives.  Most received\nhim with laughter, contempt, or violence; many ignored him; a few\nbeat him up; some said he just wanted to get at their firewood;\nmost said they, like the chief, felt fine.  But a dozen or so\nnatives came to him privately where he had been tossed into the\nbushes after his most recent beating, and asked him for the medicine.\n\n\"We are somehow not really happy living like this,\" they said, \"even\nthough it is the way of the world.\"  The doctor gladly gave them the\nmedicine, and in a few days they began to show remarkable signs of\nrecovery.  No longer desiring to eat dirt or jump out of trees, these\nnatives corrected their diet, improved in health, and began to apply\nthemselves to such activities as making baskets, repairing their huts,\ncaring for their children, and gathering food.  Some even began to\nquestion the wisdom of collecting stacks of wood more than twenty\nfeet high.\n\nSuch wild, unusual, and anti-social behavior did not go unnoticed by\nthe other natives, who quickly ostracized the cured natives from the\ntribal camp, calling them enemies of the current system.  And even\nthough many of the delirious natives began to suspect that the cured\nnatives were somehow better off than they, and that there might be\nmore to living than sleeping on dunghills and finding new trees to\njump out of, resistance to the cure was strong.  First, almost all\nthe educated and respectable people--the chief and his council--spoke\nagainst it, and the example of their sophistication and wealth (the\nchief's woodpile was ninety feet high) was very strong.  Many others,\nfrom the gossips to the wise man, said that the old way was right,\nand that the tribe had always behaved that way.  There were few real\nindividuals in the tribe, so that even though scores would have been\nglad to try the cure, they were afraid to stand against the rest and\ndid what everyone else was doing, which was nothing.\n\nThe witch doctor had a stronger argument against the new regimen.  He\npointed out that the cure was harder to take than the cures he\ndispensed.  The Eastern doctor's cure was painful, and though many of\nthe witch doctor's cures caused vomiting, hives, convulsions, and\nhallucinations, the natives were all familiar with these effects and\nattributed them to swallowing the medicine wrong, rather than to the\nmedicine itself.  But who knew what the fate of the cured natives\nwould eventually be?\n\nThe cured natives said they felt fine, but they might have been lying.\nAnd who was fool enough to trust an outsider, a stranger, rather than\nthe familiar witch doctor, who cursed those who took the cure because\nthey rejected his medicines as false and pernicious?  The cured natives\nsaid that a commitment must be made to trust the Eastern doctor; this\nwas too difficult or uncertain a step for many, especially in the face\nof the social pressure around them.  A decision accompanied by fear,\ndecried by the important, and rejected by society could not be made\nby everyone.\n\nAfter the time of his stay was over, the Eastern doctor showed the\ncured natives how to compound the medicine and then left.  As\ngenerations passed, most of the natives remained loyal to the\ndunghill, but a few took the cure.\n\n\n\n\nLove\n\nOtto and his girlfriend Brissa were driving merrily down the middle\nof the road one rainy night on their way to a party when they\napproached a little old lady trying vainly to change a flat tire.\n\n\"Gee, that's too bad,\" said Brissa.\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Otto.\n\n\"Maybe we should help her,\" added Brissa.\n\n\"We?  You mean me.  I'm not going to get wet.  Besides, what good\nwould it do me to help her?  I don't even know who she is, and she\nprobably doesn't have any money, or at least not enough to make\ngetting wet worthwhile.\"\n\n\"But it would make you feel good to do a good deed,\" Brissa offered.\n\n\"Well, it makes me feel good to stay in here and keep dry,\"\nsnapped Otto.\n\n\"It would make me happy, Otto,\" said Brissa, in her softest, most\nfeminine voice.\n\n\"You?  Boy, you're awfully selfish.  Always thinking about yourself.\nYou know, I wasn't put here just to cater to your stupid, idle\nwhims.\"  As his anger rose, Otto sped up a little, just in time to\nhit a large puddle near the little old lady, drenching her in a sheet\nof muddy water.\n\n\"Stop, Otto!\" Brissa cried, exasperated.  \"I'll help her.\"\n\n\"Aw shut up,\" Otto snarled.  \"Do you think I'm going to walk into the\nparty with a girl who's all wet and disheveled, looking like a\ndrowned rat?  You want people to laugh at me?  Think of somebody\nbesides yourself for a change.  Now fix your makeup and keep your\nmouth shut.\"\n\n\n\n\nIndecision\n\nOnce upon a time a dozen or so curious travelers rented a boat for a\ncruise out to an enchanted island, where, it was said, Athena sat on\nher throne dispensing rich gifts to all.  The trip was smooth enough\nfor awhile, with only a few rough seas to endure and an occasional\nshoal to avoid.  But then one morning one of the passengers discovered\nthat the boat was taking on water.\n\n\"We're sinking, we're sinking!\" some of the people cried.\n\n\"No,\" said the captain, \"the flow is not yet so fast.  If we will get\nsome buckets and bail the water out, everything will be all right.\"\nThis solution seemed simple enough.\n\nHowever, a dissension soon arose among the travelers about who would\ndo the bailing, and what buckets would be used.  \"Allow me,\" said\none.  \"It is my duty in this circumstance to bail, and I have here a\nvery solid bucket suitable to the task.\"\n\n\"Beg pardon, sir,\" said another, \"but I must be the bailer.  It is\nwritten in the laws of the sea that a person of my parts must do\nthis labor.  Besides, I have a superior bucket.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said a third.  \"This gentleman's bucket is all right, but I\nthink I should be allowed to help bail, since I am a fellow passenger.\"\n\nEveryone adduced many weighty, true, and worthy philosophical\narguments for his position, and cited laws, ethics, and political\nand procedural rules, but no person succeeded in convincing any\nother.  Soon, therefore, the discussion ceased to remain at this\nlevel, but grew rather heated, and shouts and aspersions began to\nfill the air, with perhaps even a trace of ill will.\n\n\"I refuse to allow anyone to bail this boat unless he uses this\nbucket, which, as any fool can see, is the only true bucket, clearly\nsuperior to all others,\" screamed one.\n\n\"And I absolutely refuse to see this boat bailed unless I can take part\nin the work,\" yelled another.\n\nNow these passengers all had some interest in seeing the boat bailed,\nand most hoped that this impasse could be overcome to the\nsatisfaction of everyone.  But since no one knew exactly what to\ndo, nothing was done.\n\n\"Perhaps we will get to the enchanted island without bailing the\nboat,\" hoped one.\n\nIt was not to be so.  While the travelers continued to debate, some\nsuggesting unworkable alternatives and the others remaining\nunyielding, the boat continued to fill, until at one sudden and\nhorrifying moment, the water rushed in over the gunwales and across\nthe deck.  The hold filled rapidly, and in spite of every man's\nfrenzied efforts, the boat sank, carrying the stubborn but now\ntoo-late-repentant travelers, together with their screaming wives\nand virgin daughters, to the very bottom of the sea.\n\n\n\n\nThe Limit\n\nOne day a man was walking through a forest and got lost.  \"Nothing\ncould be worse than this,\" he said.  Then it got dark.  \"Lost in\nthe dark.  What could be worse?\" he asked.  Then it got cold.\n\"Now nothing could possibly be worse,\" he said as he shivered and\nstumbled around.  But then it began to rain.  \"How could anything\nbe worse than this?\" he asked himself.  But then the rain turned\nto snow and the wind came up.  \"This is absolutely the worst\npossible thing that could ever happen,\" he said.  \"There's nothing\nleft.\"  But then he fell and broke his arm.  \"Well, that's it,\" he\nthought.  \"This is the worst of all.\"  But as he lay in the snow, a\ntree branch broke off and fell on him, breaking both his legs.\n\"This is worse than the worst,\" he thought.  \"But at least nothing\nelse can happen.\"  But then he heard the sound of wolves coming his\nway.  The noise was so startling that the man awoke and discovered\nthat he had been dreaming.  \"What a dream I had,\" he said, shaking\nhimself.  \"Nothing could be worse.\"\n\n\n\n\nHow Sir Reginald Helped the King\n\nOnce upon a time in the kingdom of Plebnia, the king was having a\nreal problem with his letters to the outlying regions.  His messages\nalways seemed to arrive too late.  No matter how early he mailed them,\nhis Christmas cards arrived in July and his Valentines arrived on\nDecember 24, creating confusion and uncertainty among the people\nand giving the Problem Element an excuse to arouse the Rabble\nagainst him.\n\nAfter some thought, the king had an idea: he would give ten million\ngreedos (their monetary unit) and the hand of his totally gorgeous\ndaughter to the person who could make his mail arrive the fastest.\nHis loyal subjects immediately rushed to solve the problem, setting\nthemselves to this task with an enthusiasm that an objective observer\nmight well have described as manic.  People ran back and forth, up and\ndown, muttering, \"Move the mail, shove the mail, fling it, sling it.\nRun.  Hurry.  Shoot the mail, toss it, heave it,\" and such like.\n\nIncluded in the many and varied offered solutions were proposals to\nbuild a rocket sled, crisscross the countryside with pneumatic tubes,\nuse fast horses stimulated by strong coffee, borrow a dragster from\nthe sports arena, set up a reliable airline, make a jet-powered\nconveyor belt, or just use ordinary mailmen under the threat of\nimmediate, violent death if they delayed the mail.\n\nHowever, Sir Reginald, the young, handsome hero of this tale, out of\nthe goodness of his heart, his love for the king, and the excitement\nof the challenge (and scarcely considering the money or the girl more\nthan four or five hours a day), decided to take a few minutes to\nexamine the problem before he tried to solve it.\n\n\"Just what is it the king wants to do?\" he asked himself.  \"He wants\nto send his mail quickly.  And just what is mail?  It's a message,\ninformation.  Information, hmm.  Information can be sent\nelectronically, by wire or transmission.  Yes.  Hmm.  Yes--A\ntransmitter on one end and a printer on the other end would permit\nthe king's mail to be sent at the speed of light.  That should pretty\nmuch squash Sir Rodney's proposal to use battery-powered frisbees.\"\n\nWell, what can we say?  The brilliance of this proposal was so\nobvious that Sir Reginald was declared the winner and the plan was\nimmediately instituted.  The mail began to arrive on time, the king\nsoon became popular again in the outlying regions, and Sir Reginald\nretired to spend the rest of his days in a spiffy castle on top of\na hill, with his totally gorgeous wife and, later, seventeen children.\n\n\n\n\nHow the Noble Percival Won the Fair Arissa\n\nOnce upon a time in a kingdom by the sea, two knights stood talking\nabout the strategy of battle when their conversation was interrupted\nby the sight of the beautiful Arissa as she walked upon the green.\n\"Forsooth, I think I'll ask her for a date,\" said Sir Wishful, one\nof the knights.  \"Ditto,\" said Sir Percival, the other knight.\n\nSo Sir Wishful sauntered up to Arissa in his most elegant and\nrefined manner, and, twirling his mustache genteelly, said, \"Arissa,\nmy dear, methinks I'd like to take you out to dinner.\"\n\nArissa sized up Sir Wishful a moment and then replied, \"Sorry,\nWishy, you're not my type.\"\n\nSir Percival, seeing his rival stumble off in a confused,\nembarrassed, humiliated, dazed--oh you get the idea.  Anyway,\nSir Percival saw his opportunity and approached Arissa.  \"Arissa,\"\nhe said, \"how about a date anon?\"  Only a moment was needed for\nthe look of mild surprise to alter the beautiful maiden's features,\nafter which she laughed loudly in Sir Percival's face for a good\nten minutes.\n\nWell, both Sir Wishful and Sir Percival retired to lick their wounds\nand lament the fate of men in this whole romantic con game, and Sir\nWishful soon enough decided that he liked the taste of trout just\nabout as well as the taste of women's lips, so he grabbed his bait\nand tackle and headed for the river.  Sir Percival, on the other hand,\nreally thought Arissa might be worth another attempt, and he\nrationalized with himself that perhaps she didn't quite understand\nthe question.  \"Or belikes the maiden is just shy,\" he thought.\n\nSo Sir Percival, seeing on another day the fair, delicate Arissa\nusing her footman's coat to clean the mud off her shoes, again\napproached and asked: \"Arissa, sweet one, won't you go out with\nme sometime?\"\n\nArissa generously gave Sir Percival a look that could have frozen\nseveral pounds of choice lobster, and replied, \"You must be kidding.\"\n\nSir Percival thought about this answer for a couple of days, and\nstill finding his inclination toward the gentle Arissa unchanged,\nhe thought to make a clarificatory attempt, just in case the maiden\ndid believe he had been kidding.  Approaching her the next morning,\nSir Percival said, \"Kind Arissa, I wasn't kidding the other day.\nIfay, I'd like to date you.\"  Only the author's extreme commitment\nto complete truth forces him to admit that a tiny trace of irritation\nnow flashed, but only for the briefest of moments, across the lovely\nArissa's brow.  \"Get lost, creep,\" she said, clearly and distinctly.\n\nWell, needless to say, by now most of the other knights in the realm\nwere getting sufficient jollies out of Sir Percival's romantic\nendeavors.  Even Sir Wishful had joined in the laughter, ridicule,\nand derision that seasoned Sir Percival's every meal with his friends.\nThis hilarity touched the young knight and caused him to spend several\ndays in contemplation of his past behavior.  \"Am I gaining or losing\nground with Arissa?\" he asked himself.  \"Rather had she said, 'Get\nlost' before she said, 'You must be kidding,' for as it stands, I\ncan't say I'm making much progress.\"\n\nBut \"Steadfast\" was probably Sir Percival's middle name (or his\nuncle's middle name, anyway), so the knight decided to approach\nArissa yet again.  After all, Arissa seemed to be pretty okay,\nand Sir Percival wanted a date.  In a few days, then, Arissa\nheard a familiar question in a familiar voice: \"Arissa, sweetheart,\nlet me ensconce you in my carriage and take you on a date.\"  To\nwhich Arissa replied, \"Sorry Perce, I'm busy.  I've got to\nwash my hair.\"\n\nTo which the knight: \"Well, when could you go then?\"\n\nTo which Arissa: \"Well, I'll be busy for the next ten years.  I\nmean, I've got stuff to do, forsooth.\"\n\nWell, our hero was getting a bit despondent about all this, and for\nsure his friends weren't helping much.  Far from their giving him\nencouragement, their laughter rang so constantly in Sir Percival's\nhead that he began to wonder if he was still quite sane.  And not\na few of his friends hinted here and there that psychiatric\nconsultation might be useful to the knight, to get him over his\nridiculous interest in the agreeable Arissa.\n\nAbout this time it so happened that as Sir Percival was on his way\nto visit Sir Wishful for a nice dinner of trout and onions, he quite\nunexpectedly came upon Arissa, lovely as ever, sitting near the\nvillage waterfall and picking her teeth.  Almost out of habit, Sir\nPercival spoke: \"Arissa, sugar, would you like to go out with\nme sometime?\"\n\nTo which Arissa: \"Oh, Perce, didn't I tell you I was busy?\"\n\nTo which Sir Percival: \"Yeah, fair one, but I thought maybe you'd\nhad a cancellation or something.\"\n\nTo which Arissa: \"Well, if I did have a cancellation, I wouldn't\nfill it up with you.  Besides, what would we do?\"\n\nTo which Sir Percival: \"We could go to dinner.\"\n\nTo which Arissa: \"Like where, ifay?\"\n\nTo which Sir Percival: \"Andre's French Victuals.\"\n\nTo which Arissa: \"And when would this be?\"\n\nTo which Sir Percival: \"I dunno.  How about tomorrow night?\"\n\nTo which--well, anyway, to her own surprise, to the astonishment of\nSir Percival, and to the great confusion of the rest of the kingdom,\nArissa finally actually agreed to this scenario and the next evening\nthe two young people went to Andre's.\n\nArissa, of course, ordered the eleven most expensive things on the\nmenu, for she was still intending to discourage Sir Percival, but\nthe knight was willing to put up with only a glass of water for his\nown dinner, because the success he had enjoyed so far with the\ndesirable Arissa had quite taken away his appetite anyway.\n\nIn the course of the evening, Arissa happened to remark, \"I wish\nthey had apricots on the menu here.  You know, I really love them.\nI could eat them by the ton.\"\n\nTo which Sir Percival: \"Why, Arissa, my dove, I own an orchard of\napricot trees.\"\n\nTo which Arissa: \"Really?  Oh, Perce.\"  When she pronounced his name,\nthe young maiden sighed and a glisten appeared in one or both eyes.\n\nWell, from here the story gets pretty mushy, so we'd better make it\nshort.  This delightful couple soon held hands; they discovered anon\nthat their lips fit together pretty well, Arissa's ten years' worth\nof plans were miraculously cancelled, and Sir Percival finally asked\nthe Big Question, to which Arissa replied, \"Well, okay.\"\n\nAnd so they were married and lived happily ever after, with Arissa\noften telling Sir Percival how she had secretly loved him from the\nfirst time she saw him, while Sir Percival, each time he kissed\nArissa's apricot-flavored lips, congratulated himself for his skill\nin winning her.\n\n\n\n\nTruth Carved in Stone\n\nA wise old philosopher was walking through the park with a young man\nand his true love when they came upon a beautiful statue of a Nereid.\n\"Come here,\" he said to the youth, \"and touch this statue.\" The young\nman put his hand on the statue's arm and felt of it closely, though\nhe did not seem surprised at what he found.  \"Now the girl,\" the old\nman continued; so the lover also felt of his girlfriend's arm, in the\nsame way.  \"And now,\" the man said, \"tell me what you have learned.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" the young man began.  \"The statue is hard and cold;\nthe girl is warm and soft.  Her flesh yields when I press; the marble\ndoes not.\"\n\n\"You have learned well,\" concluded the philosopher, \"and if each of\nyou remembers and lives by these truths, you will have a happy\nlife together.\"\n\n\n\n\nHow Sir Philo Married a Beautiful Princess\nInstead of the Woman He Loved\n\nOnce upon a time--and it had to be pretty long ago, as you will\nsee--there lived a bunch of people in a little inland kingdom.  The\nking, Cleon the Modest, was basically a good fellow, though he was\nnot known for his brilliance in government.  Instead, he was known\nchiefly for his glowing and nubile daughter, Jennifrella, a girl,\nthough proud and a trifle petulant, so freighted with beauty and\ncharms that pretty much every bachelor--and not a few married\nmen--in the kingdom dreamed about her, whether awake or asleep.\nTruly, she maketh my pen tremble even as I write this.\n\nNow Cleon was desirous of marrying off this legendary beauty as soon\nas possible so that he could be free of the constant entreaties for\nher hand, free of the frequent bills for supplying her dressing table,\nand free to spend more time in his rose garden, which he truly loved.\nThe king would have had little trouble choosing the richest suitor in\nthe kingdom for his daughter, except that there were no exceptionally\nwealthy bachelors in the realm, and those of modest wealth all had\ncastles and money boxes of essentially similar dimensions.\n\nFor her part, the Princess Jennifrella was repletely enamored of Sir\nFassade, a handsome, dashing, suave, carefree young knight who most\npeople, when they faced reality, agreed would almost certainly become\nher husband and therefore the next king.\n\nKing Cleon, however, was desirous of exercising his regal authority\nin having a say in who would follow him on the throne.  And faced\nwith what he clearly saw was an impossible number of choices, he\ntherefore sought the opinion of his favorite advisor, the young Sir\nPhilo.  Now, persons of a cynical bent might begin to think that Sir\nPhilo, an eligible bachelor himself and not at all impervious to\nfeminine gorgeousness, would argue craftily that he himself was the\nmost suitable and worthy candidate.  This might have been so but for\ntwo equally powerful reasons.  First, Sir Philo, brave, skilled, and\nthoughtful, was a man of integrity who would never abuse his position\nas the king's advisor to advance his own interests, even in a matter\nso emotionally and biologically compelling as that before us.  The\nother reason is that Sir Philo was already in love with another.  It\nwas a gentle love, like a deep river, quiet and calm on the surface\nbut fully substantial and powerful in its flow.\n\nHis happiness, the Lady Lucinda, though not of outward visage the\nequal of Jennifrella, was handsome enough for the young knight's\ndaydreams.  When asked what attracted him to Lucinda, he would answer\nambiguously or mutter something about the light in her eyes.  What\njoy he got sitting with her under a tree in the bright spring, gazing\nupon her and dallying with her fingers or brushing a love-sick gnat\nfrom her collar.  But what really twirled Sir Philo's cuff links was\nLucinda's wit, her laugh, her playfulness.  He relished taking the\nsprightly maid hand in hand on long walks, listening to the music of\nher voice and to the sentiments accompanying the music.  How he loved\nto play with her tresses, or when her hair was up, to steal up behind\nher and kiss her unexpectedly on the back of the neck: for she would\ninvariably produce a little shriek of surprise and delight and\nembarrassment, and then turning to him, her cheeks glowing\nirresistibly, attempt to glare and call him \"monster,\" only to spoil\nher mock anger by bursting into giggles or even outright laughter.\nShe would chide him and call him \"rogue,\" and \"impertinent,\" and he\nwould say something like, \"I'll put a stop to this abuse,\" and then\ntheir lips, who were old friends by now, would once again meet for\nfellowship.  Of course, Lucinda would struggle just enough to\nenhance the enjoyment, until laughter or an unexpected visitor broke\ntheir embrace.\n\nWell, enough mush.  The point is that an unspoken understanding had\ndeveloped between them so that only a few months after the rest of\nthe kingdom knew it, they realized that they would one day wed and\ntogether laugh and cry through the years until death should wake them.\n\nBut to return to the weightier problem of King Cleon.  Upon being\nasked for his advice, Sir Philo recommended that the king choose from\namong the following options.  One, his majesty could choose the wisest\nand most just suitor for Jennifrella, for such a man would not only\nmake a good king, but he would most likely be a decent husband, too.\nOr secondly, the king might seek a foreign alliance and marry his\ndaughter to another king's son.  This was an alternative which Sir\nPhilo did not recommend, but mentioned only for the sake of\ncompleteness.  And finally, the last possibility would be to let\nJennifrella choose for herself--in which case, everyone knew that\nSir Fassade would be the next king, and he, opined Sir Philo, would\nbe \"acceptable,\" producing a government no worse than the current\none.  (Since I have already described the king's advisor as\n\"thoughtful,\" I shall now add \"tactful\" and note that the final\nparticipial phrase of the previous sentence was thought but not\nuttered by the knight.)  As for the kind of husband Sir Fassade would\nmake, the princess would have no one to blame but herself.\n\nKing Cleon thought the matter over not quite long enough and decided\nto hold an archery contest, the winner of which would marry his\ndaughter.  The degree of Sir Philo's consternation is not recorded\nin the annals from which I am plagiarizing, but one may suppose that\nit was substantial, for reasons which will hereinafter appear.\nNeedless to say (except to make the story longer and extend the\nreader's pleasure), Sir Philo made energetic protests, which\neventually descended to rather pathetic entreaties, all in a\nfutile attempt to change the king's mind.  But King Cleon would\nnot be dissuaded, and so the news was soon heralded throughout the\nkingdom, and, as you might suppose, arrow sales shot up immediately\nand remarkably.\n\nAs when a child pounds the ground near an anthill, causing a good\nmany of the residents instantly to surface and run around in massed\npanic, so on the day of the contest the world arrived in a swarm at\nthe castle of Cleon the Modest and prepared to be a witness, if not\nthe victor, in the winning of Jennifrella.\n\nThere were several dozen contenders in the contest, some quite\naccomplished archers, some more or less dilettantish, and quite a\nfew whose skills put the spectators at random hazard.  Amid the\nnoise and enthusiasm on this day stood a grim and silent Sir Philo,\ndeeply troubled about the proceedings for three reasons.  First,\nstrictly from a philosophical standpoint, a shooting contest was\na completely irrational method of choosing either a spouse or a\nfuture king, and irrationality like this always troubled the\nyoung knight.\n\nSecond, though Sir Fassade was a very good shot, capable of\nsatisfactorily humiliating most of the other contestants, he was no\nmatch for Sir Bargle.  If they used the word then, I would have to\nexaggerate only slightly to say that Sir Bargle was, as they say in\nFrench, or maybe don't, a jerque.  He punctuated nearly every\nsentence with an oath or a belch, constantly leered at the ladies\nin waiting (who knew all too well to keep a safe distance from him),\nand those who attended carefully to his speech noted that the word\nhe used more than any other was \"me.\" In a word (or fourteen,\nactually), Sir Bargle was a man unlikely to put his personal\nappetites in second place.  The prospect of this knight nuzzling\nthe hair or nibbling the earlobes of Jennifrella was in itself\nsufficiently revulsive to Sir Philo; the prospect of his becoming\nking was absolutely unthinkable.\n\nThe third reason that the king's advisor was grieved about the\n\"score ahead and wed\" method of selecting the princess' groom was\nthat the only person in all the realm who could outshoot Sir Bargle\nwas--Sir Philo.\n\nPrithee, talk not to me about psychic conflict--nay, psychic trauma,\nfor I have seen it here, and it is not gentle.  Sir Philo traced and\nretraced many steps around the castle grounds, without thought of\ndirection or destination, the movement of his feet and the tension\non his face reflecting the turmoil in his soul.  At length, in his\nanxiety, the brave knight turned to his lady love for succor and\nadvice, and she, with a swiftness that surprised him and a nobility\nthat made him love her more deeply than ever, told him that of course\nhe must put the interest of the kingdom above his personal happiness.\nShe then flew into his arms and burst into inconsolable sobbing for\nlonger than we have time to look in on.\n\nThe contest began and proceeded remarkably well, with only the loss\nof a too-curious cow and a few luckless birds at the hands of the\nless accomplished suitors.  Sir Fassade shot well that day, achieving\na personal best.  As each arrow hit, closer and closer toward the\nmiddle of the target, it made the princess clap a little louder and\nleap with joy a little higher.  A smirk of self-congratulation soon\ndecorated Sir Fassade's handsome face.\n\nA loud belch and a louder laugh announced the commencement of Sir\nBargle's shooting.  As predicted by Sir Philo, Sir Bargle was an\nexcellent shot.  As each arrow landed a good handbreadth closer to\nthe center of the target than any of those of Sir Fassade, the smiles\non the faces of the princess and her favorite knight grew less and\nless until they had been completely replaced by somber looks on the\nknight and what might be described as silent hysteria on the face of\nthe princess.  The look on Sir Bargle's face at the conclusion of his\nshooting is a little too carnal for me to describe.\n\nAs he shot his set of arrows, Sir Philo was forced more than once,\nafter he had fully drawn his bow, to pause, and to wait until a\nlittle tremble--attributed by the crowd to nervousness and eagerness\nto win Jennifrella--left his hands.  As each arrow hit the target,\nremarkably near the middle, it also pierced the very center of\nLucinda's heart.  The young knight thought more than once about\nletting an arrow fly wide of the target, but he did his duty,\nthough it brought grief to himself and devastation to the woman\nhe treasured.\n\nSir Philo's smile as he took the hand of the princess was obviously\nforced, but no one noticed because Jennifrella was now bawling so\nspectacularly that the crowd, though not at all wishing to be unkind,\nfound it, frankly, entertaining.\n\nAs it does for us all, time passed and life went on.\n\nAfter a peculiar three years' delay, Lucinda finally made her choice\nfrom among several good offers and moved with her new husband to a\nremote part of the kingdom where it was reported that she was content,\nthough some said that the cooler climate had somewhat subdued her\nwell-known effervescence.\n\nIn the fullness of time, Sir Philo exchanged his sword for a crown\nand ascended the throne.  He ruled wisely and justly, and the kingdom\nprospered.  Hero that he was, he had mostly adjusted to the princess'\npersonality, reminding himself as occasion required (and occasion did\nrequire), that not only had he acted for the good of the kingdom, but\nhe had wed great beauty and, eventually, personal power.  He further\nreminded himself that Jennifrella had made an adequate wife, even\nafter her face wrinkled and her tummy pudged, and that she had proved\nto be a reasonable mother to his children.  Whenever, in a moment of\ninattention, he discovered himself pining to enjoy a witty remark or\nsome unguarded laughter, he quoted, hoping that it was true, the old\nproverb that \"we grow most not when something is given but when\nsomething is taken away.\"\n\nAll in all, it was a reasonable life with much to be thankful for.\nJennifrella's joy was that Sir Philo, now King Philo, remained a\ngenerous and loving husband even as her beauty faded; her only\nregret was that Sir Fassade had married her younger and more amiable\nsister, and both of them appeared to be altogether too happy.\nLucinda's joy was in her two lovely children, whom she took, once or\ntwice, to see the new king as he made a royal progress through their\nvillage.  Her only regret was that she could reveal only half her\nheart as she told them what a good man he was.  Sir Philo's joy was\nthat he had acted virtuously and now enjoyed a mostly pleasant life,\ndispensing justice and mercy with care and humanity.  His only regret\nwas that he had learned to shoot arrows.\n\n\n\n\nSerendipity\n\nA young man, in the confusion and embarrassment of youth, was walking\nacross the campus of a great university on the way to his philosophy\nclass.  At the previous meeting, the professor had posed the\nquestion, \"If we do not know the purpose of something, how can we\nknow whether any aspect of it is good or bad?\"  This question,\ntogether with the problem for the day, \"Does man have a purpose?\" had\ntaken complete occupation of the young man's mind, not because of any\nintrinsic interest, but because the professor was in the habit of\ncalling on students and expecting a thoughtful response.  So deeply\nmeditative was the young man that he neglected to observe his path\nadequately, with the result that he soon bounced his head off an\nunhappily placed tree in the middle of the lawn.\n\nPicking himself up and dusting himself off, the young man looked\naround to see if anyone had witnessed his inadvertent folly.  The\nonly people nearby were two men, who, although they were just a dozen\nfeet away, were completely oblivious to the young man's accident, for\nthe reason that they were engaged in a somewhat heated argument.\nWhether to obtain some sympathy for his bruised head, or to excuse his\ninattention, or perhaps simply because they were standing near a wheel\nbarrow and looked for all the world like gardeners, the young man\ninterrupted them with the slightly exasperated question, \"Excuse me,\nbut what is that tree doing there, anyway?\"\n\nNow it so happens that these two men were not gardeners at all.  They\nwere, in fact, tenured professors of philosophy, the very subject the\nyoung man was struggling to understand.  They turned to him at once\nand condescended to admit him to their conversation.\n\n\"Well,\" said the first philosopher, pushing his glasses up the bridge\nof his nose, \"see here.  This is a tree.\"  And pointing to the tree\nthe young man was already too-intimately familiar with, concluded with\napparent satisfaction, \"As Circumplexius has said in the fourth book\nof his De Scientia, 'An example is the best definition.'\"\n\n\"I know that is a tree,\" replied the youth, rubbing his forehead.\n\"What I want to know is, Why is it there in the first place?\"\n\n\"You see,\" said the other philosopher to the first, \"the dance of\nthe blind with the senile.\"  Then, momentarily stroking his beard, he\nturned to the young man and continued, \"A tree means what it is.  The\nconcept of treedom does not subsist in some fortuitous, exogenous\nhyle--that is the doctrine of carpenters, not of philosophers.  As\nHerman of Rimboa has aptly remarked, 'Inner eyes must perceive beyond\nwhat the outer eyes see.'\"\n\n\"And as the Chinese say, 'The flies buzz in the wind, but men drink\ntheir tea,'\" added the one with glasses.  \"Here, son,\" he went on,\npointing again, \"this is also a tree.  Compare them and deduce\ntreehood by subtracting the anomalous from the universal.\"\n\n\"Certainly you have read Dohesius On the Nature of the Universe in\nthe last twenty-five years,\" the other philosopher said with some\nindignation.  \"Don't you recall his dictum that 'a second example is\nnot an explanation'?  How do you pretend to instruct the ignorance of\nyouth when you have never instructed yourself?  'The canvas remains\nblank when the artist has no paint,' says Hugo de Brassus.  Go back\nto your books.\"\n\n\"And as de Roquefort says, 'To sit on a cheese and eat whey is the\ndestiny of fools.'\"\n\n\"See here, young man,\" said the beard, ignoring his colleague,\n\"treeness is a life process displaying the aspiration of matter\ntoward hierarchy, order, and structure.  It finds analogues and\neven homologues in life systems everywhere.\"\n\n\"The frogs croak at night, but the sky remains dark,\" said the\nglasses, smirking slightly.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" replied the beard.  \"What I have said is self-evident.\nSir Humphrey Boodle even noted it.\"\n\n\"But Boodle has been refuted these three hundred years.\"\n\n\"Well, Calesimon said so, too.\"\n\n\"Hah!\" cried the glasses with a laugh of forced incredulity.\n\"Calesimon!  Calesimon was an idiot!\"\n\n\"Argumentum ad hominem.\"\n\n\"Oh, come on.  The man was institutionalized.\"\n\n\"And genetic fallacy, too.  My, my.\"\n\n\"Ignore him, son,\" said the glasses to the youth.  \"He's not been\nvery well since his wife laughed at his last paper.  A tree--\"\n\n\"She did not laugh,\" interrupted the beard.\n\n\"--is a woody plant containing specialized structures, larger overall\nthan a bush and often, as you see here [pointing] having only one\ntrunk rather than many.\"\n\n\"And is this the effect of dotage or of primordial ignorance?\"\n\n\"False dilemma, Mr. Logician.\"\n\n\"Surely you were there that day in bonehead English when they\ndistinguished between 'definition' and 'explanation.'  You are familiar\nwith the English language, aren't you?  The young man has asked for\nan explanation.\"\n\n\"Well, as Frabonarde says, 'The whole is known by its parts.'\"\n\n\"The doctrine of those who pull the wings from fruit flies.\"\n\n\"Yes, it would be too straightforward for someone who needs six\nhundred pages to discover that he doesn't know what he is\ntalking about.\"\n\n\"A classic example of the projectionist error.  Not everything you\ndon't understand is a problem with the text,\" said the beard, tapping\nhis finger to his temple.\n\n\"If I may be permitted one last allusion to Oriental wisdom, I would\nnote only that the Chinese have said, 'Men hurt their eyes seeking\na water lily in a rock garden--even in a large rock garden.'\"\n\n\"I thought you knew that the Poems of Chen had been exposed as a\nproduct of nineteenth-century Europe.  Don't make it a habit to go\naround quoting hoaxes.  It gives philosophy a bad name.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, sirs,\" the youth interjected, \"but I have to go now.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the beard.  \"Only remember, with the knowledge\nyou attain, seek to achieve understanding.\"\n\n\"Oh, so now we are quoting the Bible!\" cried the glasses with\ntriumphant scorn.  \"The rest of the department will be interested\nin this.\"\n\n\"I was not quoting the Bible.  I have never even read the Bible.\"\n\n\"Why don't you ask God to bless him while you're at it?\"\n\n\"Listen, don't you think I know that your doctrine of cosmic mental\nstates is just a front and that you're a closet monotheist?\"\n\n\"And may I remind you that slander is an offense punishable by law?\"\n\n\"And is this the state of a wise man?\" asked the beard, looking at\nthe sky, \"to threaten his friend for speaking truth?\"\n\n\"Now he's even praying!  I can't believe this!\"\n\n\"'We cannot see around corners,' says Germulphius, 'so what is left\nto the man who refuses to see in a straight line?'\"\n\n\"Someone like your wife,\" answered the glasses.  \"No doubt by now\nshe's found twelve more insupportably ridiculous assertions in your\npaper on aperceptual phenomenalism.\"\n\n\"Well, at least my wife reads my papers.  At least my wife can read.\"\n\n\"My wife is an avid reader of literature.\"\n\n\"Since when did the television listings become 'literature'?  That's\nthe most transparent semantic ploy I have ever heard.\"\n\n\"Are you accusing me of owning a television?\"\n\n\"He who can see the maggots need not ask if the dog is dead.\"\n\n\"'Ignore the shadow cast by a passing vapor,' says Phonetes.\"\n\n\"You've always been sloppy with bibliography, haven't you?\" demanded\nthe beard.  \"Phonetes would have been utterly embarrassed to have\nsaid that.\"\n\n\"No matter.  Truth needs no ascription.\"\n\n\"That statement is obviously the product of extensive reading and\nprotracted thought.  With a little more effort, no doubt you'll be\nable to announce that the sun shines on a clear day.\"\n\n\"I suppose you have never read von Hoch: 'I had always known what he\nsaid, but I did not live it until I heard it spoken.'\"\n\n\"I reject that statement together with its sordid implications.  It\nsmacks of the grimy hands of utilitarianism.  In a minute you'll be\ninsisting that philosophy have practical consequences for berry\npickers and children.  Perhaps you would be happier as some sort of\nmechanic where you could get your hands on things, rather than as one\nwho pretends to instruct youth.\"\n\n\"You and Sir Peter Poole, who was proud that he couldn't tell a hoe\nfrom a rake.\"\n\n\"Well, what of that?  My profession is philosophy, and I look for truth,\nnot for mud.\"\n\n\"Even the sun cannot be seen through a silver coin.\"\n\n\"I have never accepted money for anything I've published,\" said the\nbeard hotly.\n\n\"'Beware of those who look to the right and walk to the left,' says\ndella Corta.\"\n\n\"How dare you accuse me--\"  At this point they were interrupted.  A\nyoung man, deeply preoccupied with thinking about the purpose of\nmankind, had just bounced his head against a tree and--ah, but this\nis where you came in.\n\n\n\n\nA Tale Revealing the Wisdom Of Being a Cork on the River of Life\n\nOnce upon a time, not very far from a town pretty much like yours,\nan old, nearsighted man was wandering down a country road quite\npleasantly, musing to himself thusly: \"I wonder what I should seek\ntoday?  Some new treasure of the Orient, or a lost clue to the\nsecrets of nature?  That would be nice, as I spit\" (and here, had\nthere been but a small brass spittoon by the wayside, a clear ring\nwould have sounded across the nearby pastures), \"but,\" continued the\nold man, \"this is pretty barren ground hereabouts, so I'd best not\nset my hopes too high.  I'll start by looking for a silver dollar.\"\n\nWith this thought, the man's eyes brightened and he continued now\nmore alertly down the road, staring intently at the ground and\nknocking little pebbles around with his cane.  After a little, he\nthought he saw something ahead.  Mending his pace somewhat, he\nhurried (as an old man with a cane hurries) up to the object, which\nhe now believed to be a quarter.  When he stooped down to pick it\nup, however, he found it to be merely a bottle cap, covered with red\nants eating the remaining sugar.  \"Just what I was looking for!\"\nexclaimed the old man with glee, even though the ants began to sting\nhim on the thumb and forefinger.  \"Bottlecaps can be very useful.\"\nSo he put the new possession into his pocket and once more began his\nstroll, still watching the ground.\n\nHe had hardly begun to wonder what he might find next, when, there,\njust a little way off, he saw a pearl lying in the roadbed.\n\"Surely,\" he thought, \"nothing is round or shiny exactly like a\npearl, so I could not be mistaken this time.\"  So he began to amble\nover without delay.  As he came nearer, his joy increased.  \"Hee\nhee!\" the old man laughed, before stifling his mirth lest he call\nattention to himself and bring competitors for his newfound\ntreasure.  He even paused a moment and looked around to see if\nanyone had noticed him or the pearl.\n\nThe way seemed clear so he closed the final distance, reached down,\nand picked it up.  Instantly he was aware that this was no pearl,\nbut just a partly dried up chicken brain, which must have fallen off\nsome farmer's cart, or been left by some animal in haste.  \"Just\nwhat I was looking for!\" the old man said very joyfully.  \"Chicken\nbrains make real good soup.\"  Into his pocket with the bottle cap\nwent the brains, and down the road with his cane went the old man.\n\nIt was not long after this that he saw another, much larger item in\nthe road before him, which looked, from where he now was, just\nexactly like a fat roll of paper money.  Blessing his astrological\nreading promising riches for that day, he made his way up to the\nspot with a speed truly remarkable for a person of his age and\ninfirmities, and anxiously bent over to retrieve his treasure.  A\ncloser look, however, and a confirming touch revealed that the man\nhad found a \"road apple,\" or, as it is sometimes called, a \"horse\nbiscuit.\"  \"Just what I was looking for,\" the old man said, now more\nperfectly pleased than ever; \"I can use this biscuit to cook my\nchicken soup.  Seems dry enough to burn right well.\"\n\nNow the old man, between his nearsightedness and his preoccupation\nwith his great discoveries, wandered unknowingly over to the side of\nthe road, and pretty soon he stepped off into a ditch and fell down\nwith remarkable violence.  A farmer not very far off saw this\nepisode, and hurried over to help the old man up.  As he got to his\nfeet, the old man, wincing with pain and holding one arm, cried out\nwith a tone of satisfaction, \"A broken arm!  Just what I was looking\nfor!  A broken arm can be very useful.\"  The farmer blinked once or\ntwice, recognizing that this sentiment did not conform with what his\nown would have been under the like circumstances, but he said\nnothing.  Instead, he quite generously helped the old gentleman into\nhis cart and took him to town.\n\nWhen the two arrived, the farmer dutifully summoned a doctor and the\nconstable and some others of note in the place and repeated how the\nold man had fallen and broken his arm, only to exclaim that such a\nresult was apparently what he had intended.  This narrative caused\nsome strange looks and a little discussion among them, and no one\ncould think what to do next (aside from fixing the man's arm), when\nthe constable suddenly remembered that he did not know the man's\nname.  \"Sir,\" he asked, \"have you any identification?\"\n\n\"Why, I think so, sonny,\" replied the old man, beginning to fumble\nin his various pockets, and then, to the indescribable surprise of\nhis audience, to remove what they did not know, and could not have\nimagined, were the souvenirs from his previous wanderings.  When his\npockets were finally emptied, there was still no identification, but\ninstead, on the table before them, his interrogators saw the\nfollowing objects, namely, viz., and to wit: the bottle cap, the\nchicken brains, the horse manure, a piece of grimy string, a cigar\nbutt, three pieces of chewed and flattened gum, a wing nut with\nstripped threads, a rusty nail (bent in two places), part of a candy\nwrapper, some rat pills (eleven of them), half a marble, and a\ncommon pebble.\n\nAfter a moment or two of reflective silence, the mayor made bold to\nspeak (seeing the constable in a reverie), and asked gently and\nsoftly, \"Where did you get all these, uh, items?\"\n\n\"Why, looking for gold and treasure, sonny,\" the old man answered,\nin a tone that implied that the mayor should have known the answer\nalready.  \"But,\" he added as a second thought, and in the face of\nthese gentlemen's now rather extravagantly and injudiciously raised\neyebrows and opened mouths, \"they were all just what I was looking\nfor--like the broken arm here.  Quite a find, eh?\"\n\nAt this point, the farmer, who had been standing generally in the\nbackground holding his hat in both hands, came forward and begged an\naudience with the constable.  \"I didn't want to say this before,\" he\nbegan in a low tone, \"but now I think I must, in case it should be\nimportant.  All the way into town that old fellow kept saying\nsomething to me about wanting to cook his brains by burning a horse\nbiscuit under his cap.\"\n\nThat was enough.  And, needless to say, the Authorities from the\nInstitution in the city were immediately summoned, and the old man\nwas taken to a very pleasant place where he could rest among friends\nand nice people, have no worries, and be free to enjoy the\n\"butterflies, blue skies, and happiness always.\"  It is reported by\nreliable sources that shortly after arriving the old man was heard\nto exclaim cheerfully, \"Just what I was looking for!  Mattresses on\nthe walls!\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Art of Truth\n\nOnce upon a time a famous art museum searched the world over for the\nbest paintings it could find.  After a long search, the museum found\na beautiful Old Master painting depicting youths and maidens\nfrolicking in a wood.  The directors were only too glad to pay\nmillions for this painting because they were captivated by its\nbeauty and elegance.  How delightfully the maidens' hair and mouths\nwere drawn, how perfectly the hands and arms of the youths, how\nlife-like the bare feet on the forest floor.  But the curator of the\nmuseum was the happiest one of all, for he had now become guardian\nand protector of a famous work by a famous painter.  \"Every time I\nlook at that painting,\" he would say, \"I see new beauties and\nexcellences.  Just look at these leaves here, the sweep of the\nbranches from this tree, capturing just the hint of a breeze and\nseeming to vibrate with the music from the dance of the youths\nand maidens in the clearing.  My very soul resonates with the\ngreatness of it all.\"\n\nNeedless to say, this wonderful painting was the most popular\nexhibit at the museum, providing instruction and delight for\nthousands of visitors.  Everyone, from the young child who could\nbarely walk to the old man who could barely walk, enjoyed its beauty\nfrankly and openly or profited from studying its color and\narrangement.  Children loved to see the happy figures kicking up\ntheir feet with joy; the young people marveled at the freshness and\nbeauty of the figures; those of mature years stood astonished at the\nexcellent technique that could present such a convincing vision; the\nold remarked upon the feeling of cozy intimacy produced by the scene\nof innocent pleasure.\n\n\"This painting is almost too good to be true,\" remarked one visitor\nprophetically as he purchased a print of it.\n\nOne day a horrible discovery was made: the painting was not a\ngenuine Old Master after all.  It was a forgery.  It had not been\npainted by the famous artist whose name was on it, and in fact it\nhad been painted within the last ten years.  The museum directors\nand the curator were horrified and consumed with shame.  Immediately\nthe painting was jerked from the walls of the museum and\nignominiously relegated to a basement storeroom.  \"We regret such\nan unfortunate imposition,\" the curator told the museum's patrons.\n\"This painting is not art; it is a tawdry fake.  This painting\nis a lie.\"\n\nAt first the public was saddened to lose sight of such a popular\npainting, and a few mild protests were raised, but eventually\nconcern for the painting was pushed aside by other more pressing\nconcerns, and it was forgotten (as are all things no longer directly\nin front of us in this busy world) and life continued.\n\nOnly the museum curator and an occasional junior staff member ever\nsaw the painting now, hanging in the dim light of the basement well\naway from public view.  All that was heard of it was the curator's\noccasional disparaging comment.  \"Every day I see new defects and\nugliness in this fraudulent outrage,\" he would say.  \"Just look how\nfalse the sun on the leaves looks, how phony is the wisp of that\ngirl's hair, how ugly the clouds there, and how awkward that boy's\nposition in the dance.  How we were ever taken in by this obvious\ncheat is beyond me.\"  And finally, shaking his head to show his\nregret, he concluded, \"What we did was foolish and shameful.\"\n\n\n\n\nMatthew 18:3\n\n\"The door to this classroom is farther down the hall, sir,\" said\nthe student.\n\n\"How dare you try to tell me where the door is,\" huffed the\nprofessor, as he turned around and walked abruptly into the wall.\nWhile he held his bleeding nose, he was heard to mutter, \"Now why\ndid they move the door?\"\n\n* A proud man never doubts, even when his nose bleeds.\n\n\n\n\nThe Boy and the Vulture\n\nA young boy was playing in the desert with a bow and arrow he had\nmade, when a vulture, always looking for a tender meal, saw him from\nafar.  The bird flew over and, seeing that the arrow was only a\nbarren stick, swooped down and pecked at the boy.  \"Why don't you\nshoot me if you don't like my pecking?\" it taunted.  The boy shot\nhis arrow repeatedly, but the bird was too quick, and the arrow\nalways missed.\n\nFinally, exhausted from chasing the arrow and deflecting the bird,\nthe boy sat down in the sparse shade of a dead tree.  The vulture,\nlighting on one of the dry branches above the boy, sat triumphantly\npreening and smirking, and even plucked a few old feathers to drop\non the boy's head in contempt.  \"There's for your pains, feeble\none,\" the bird said haughtily.\n\nThe boy, however, would not be defeated.  Carefully he collected the\nfeathers, fixed them to his stick, and with the resultantly accurate\narrow, shot the surprised vulture through the heart.\n\n* In our pride we often unwittingly give our enemies the means to\ndestroy us.\n\n* Perseverance and ingenuity, even in the face of humiliation and\ndefeat, will at last succeed.\n\n[Suggested by Aesop, \"The Eagle and Arrow\"]\n\n\n\n\nThree Flat Tires\n\nOnce in the fullness and complexity of human existence three cars\nleft the same party one rainy night and took three different roads\non the way home.  Oddly enough, at approximately the same time, each\ncar suffered a flat tire, and the young couples inside suddenly\nfound their evening and their lives somewhat different from what\nthey had been expecting.\n\nThe young lady riding in the first car became instantly upset.\n\"Well, this is just great,\" she said to her escort with\nunderstandable disgust.  \"I knew I should have driven; then this\nnever would have happened.  How could you be so careless when we're\nall dressed up like this, anyway?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" the young man replied, getting out of the car.  \"I'll\nfix it as fast as I can.\"  He quickly retrieved the jack and the\nspare tire and began to puzzle over the repair.  In a minute the\nyoung lady was at his side.\n\n\"You don't even know what you're doing, do you?\" she asked.\n\n\"Well, not really, but I think I can figure it out,\" he told\nher honestly.\n\n\"No you won't.  I want this done right,\" the young lady answered, as\nshe grabbed the jack handle with just enough suddenness that the\nyoung man lost his balance and fell over backward into a patiently\nwaiting mud hole.\n\nWhile these events came into being to form a permanent, though\nsmall, part of the history of the universe, the young driver of the\nsecond car was, not many miles away, even then climbing out of his\nvehicle into the rain and opening the trunk.  His date, in a very\nladylike manner, and with due concern for her precious gown, stayed\nin the car with her hands folded in her lap.  She generously took\ncare to look away from the young man's labors in order not to cause\nhim embarrassment, and, when he slipped down and bumped his head on\nthe fender as he tried to loosen a particularly intransigent lug\nnut, she very kindly turned on the radio.\n\nThe third young man, though he encountered different raindrops on a\ndifferent road on this night, realized similarly that he, too, was\ndestined to be wet, and pushed open the door with resolve.  However,\nas he climbed out of the car, the young lady he had been driving\nhome got out also.  \"Get back in the car,\" he told her, \"or you'll\nget wet.\"\n\n\"I'll help,\" the young lady said.\n\n\"There's nothing you can do,\" replied the young man as he reached\nfor the spare in the trunk.  \"It's really a job for one person, and\nI've done it before.\"\n\n\"Then I'll watch,\" replied the young lady.  And watch she did.  Oh,\nshe held the lug nuts to keep them from getting lost, but to speak\ntruly, she was not really of any help and she did get drenched.  As\nhe changed the tire, the young man looked at the young lady once or\ntwice, only to see her gown melting and her hair dripping down her\nface, and no doubt he thought, \"What a sight she is.\"\n\nWell, I've told you this story as evidence of the foolishness and\nirrationality of the human heart.  For now observe the consequent:\n\nThe first young lady, naturally concerned for her safety and\nrealizing that she possessed knowledge that her young man did not,\nquite reasonably chose to change the tire.  However, the young man,\nfool that he was, was never seen escorting this capable and logical\nyoung lady again.\n\nThe second young lady, very sensibly concerned about preserving an\nexpensive dress and realizing that she would be of little or no help\nto her young man, showed a similar wisdom in avoiding what she knew\nwould be the consequences of leaving the car.  But, even though her\njudgment was vindicated when she observed, in the form of the\ndrenched, muddy, and bleeding young man, exactly those consequences\nshe had predicted, the young man himself, blind and irrational as he\nwas, was also never again seen escorting this thoughtful and\ndiscerning young lady.\n\nEven stranger and more perverse as it must seem, however, the third\nyoung man, even after observing the silly and unreasonable behavior\nof his date, even after seeing her soaked to the skin, her gown\nruined, her hair plastered against her neck, her mascara running\ndown her cheeks in little inky rivulets--even after observing all\nthis, not only was he seen escorting her frequently to other\nentertainments, but eventually he offered her a ring.\n\n\n\n\nThe History of Professor De Laix\n\nThe world had long been promised a fifty-volume definitive analysis\non the meaning of life by the brilliant and internationally\nrespected Professor de Laix.  Admirers from all across the surface\nof the earth produced unremitting and enthusiastic requests--nay,\ndemands--for the wise professor to bestow upon the world his\npenetrating insights into human nature.  As the years passed,\nhowever, even though he had been begged repeatedly for the first\npart, or a first volume, or even a first chapter, he had always\nanswered that he wanted to get the whole work clearly in his head\nbefore he put it down on paper.\n\n\"To rush precipitously forward without knowing precisely where one\nwants to go,\" he would tell them, \"will not of necessity produce a\nhappy outcome because it might lead to a complicative erroneity or\nput one on a train to a destination he would not ultimately wish to\nvisit.  After all, the most beautiful part of a given day is known\nonly after dark, and the best path up the mountain--which I take to\nbe the path of true wisdom--is seen only from the top.\"\n\nYear after year, therefore, arrived with hope and left disappointed;\nnew generations were born and millions of hopeful readers mingled\ntheir own dust with that of the earth without the benefit of even a\nphrase of Professor de Laix' wisdom.\n\nThen one spring his colleagues and students noticed that he was\ngradually becoming more and more animated, and was heard\noccasionally to mutter, \"Yes, yes, that's right, that's right.\"\nFinally one day while he was sitting in a coffee shop regaling a few\nfavorite students with tales of fruitless thinking journeys upon\nwhich he had in the past embarked, he took a sip of coffee (or\nperhaps he had inadvertently been served espresso) and then suddenly\nopened his eyes widely, sprang to his feet, and announced excitedly,\n\"That's it!  I see it all now!  Now it can be written!  Everything\nis completely clear!  So clear!  Ha ha!  Now I understand!  Now, at\nlast, I understand!\"\n\nAfter this brief speech, he burst out of the coffee shop (leaving\nhis students with expressions of amazement and an unpaid bill) and\nbegan to run toward his office where he could finally sit down and\nproduce his great work.  Now at last he could pour forth his\nhitherto inexpressible wisdom to fertilize the orchards of culture\nand bring into being a new and wonderful fruit for civilization to\nmunch upon.\n\nUnfortunately, in his highly focused and externally oblivious rush\ntoward his office, he neglected to watch for the traffic as he\ncrossed the busy boulevard between the coffee shop and the\nuniversity (for academia is often separated from the rest of life by\njust such a metaphor), and as a result he was tragically but\nthoroughly run down by a fully loaded manure truck, whose cargo had\nbeen produced after only one day's rumination, and whose owner also\nhoped that it would swell the fruit on the trees of a less\nfigurative orchard.\n\nSuch was the life and death of the great Professor de Laix, a man\nfor whom someday almost came.\n\n\n\n\nHow the Humans Finally Learned to Like Themselves\n\n     It is man's peculiar distinction to love even those who err.\n     --Marcus Aurelius, VII.22\n\n     A sweet disorder in the dress. --Herrick\n\nOnce upon a time, many years from now, technology had continued its\nremarkable progress to the point that the construction of artificial\npeople had finally become possible.  These humakins, as they were\ncalled, were made so carefully and with such art that no one could\ntell the difference between a real human and an artificial\none--except that the artificial ones were flawless.  Physically the\nhumakins were always young, always beautiful, always fresh; they\nnever had a hair out of place, never a pimple, never a wrinkle,\nnever a gray hair.  Mentally they were always bright, alert, and\nsmiling; they always got their facts right, and never took a wrong\nturn or got lost.\n\nAt first the appeal of the humakins was irresistible, and most\nhumans chose them over other humans for spouses.  What human female\ncould compete with an always slim, beautiful, and lively imitation?\nAnd what human male could compete with an always confident, correct,\nand handsome construction?  In fact, the word \"humakin\" quickly\nbecame a synonym for \"perfect,\" as in, \"That's a really humakin\ncar,\" or \"This pie tastes just humakin.\"  At the same time the word\n\"human\" became a term of opprobrium, indicating something defective\nor of low quality, as in, \"I never shop there because it's such a\nhuman store with human-quality merchandise.\"\n\nTo the consternation of many, however, while the humakins could\nconstruct more of themselves in a factory, the humans could produce\nmore of themselves only by following the ancient method of their\nancestors, so that the result of the marriages between flesh and\nplastic was the eventual decline of the human race.\n\nWhen about nine tenths of the persons on the planet consisted of the\nprecisely fabricated humakins and only one tenth of the really\nhuman, quite an odd and unexpected situation arose.  It had become\nso unusual to see, for example, a woman wearing glasses or a man\nwith wind-blown hair that such a detail now took on a natural appeal\nto some of the other humans.\n\nOne bright morning at breakfast in a fancy resort dining room, a\nhuman female, almost as lovely as a humakin, sat chatting with a\nhumakin male who had condescended to sit with her.  Suddenly she\ninadvertently spilled a glass of tomato juice onto her white tennis\ndress.  While her humakin companion predictably stood up and stared\nat her with horror, across the room a human male who had just\nwitnessed the event was so filled with ardor and longing that he\nalmost broke the table in his rush to get over to her and make her\nacquaintance.  His excitement to declare his affection left him\nwithout the capacity for coherent speech, so that only tentative and\nconfused phrases stumbled from his mouth.  In the midst of his\nbabbling, though, he could see, in the welling dew of the woman's\neyes, the tenderness of regard he had inspired.\n\nAs other humans, too, began to grow weary of the expectation of\nconstant perfection in their relationships, scenes similar to this\none began to be repeated with increasing frequency.  A loose shoe\nlace, a chipped fingernail, a shiny nose--all gradually became\nsources of romantic and emotional attraction, and those very\ncharacteristics that had before been viewed as defects soon came to\nbe seen as emblems of the truly and desirably human, as guarantees\nof that unique inner fire that no amount of perfectly crafted\nplastic could equal.\n\nThe word \"human\" now began to be associated with the genuine, the\nnatural--and the beautiful.  It became not uncommon to hear a young\nlady remark to her admirer as he gently put a flower in her hair,\n\"Oh, what a human thing of you to do.\"  The word \"humakin,\" on the\nother hand, began to imply something slickly unrealistic or\nlaughably fake and was often pronounced with a sneer.\n\nAt length, having rediscovered the amorous appeal of their\ndistinctives like freckles and missing buttons and the inability to\nrefold road maps, the humans began to marry each other again.  It\nwasn't many years before a young pledge of one of these new\nrelationships was heard to ask in a tone of frustration, \"But Mommy,\nwhy must I have a crooked tooth?\"  To which the mother replied,\n\"That's so I'll always remember how truly beautiful you really are.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Caterpillar and the Bee\n\nA bee, flying proudly around the garden, approached a caterpillar\nsitting on a shrub.  \"I don't know how you can stand to be alive,\"\nthe bee said.  \"I'm valuable to the world with my honey and wax, I\ncan fly anywhere I want, and I'm beautiful to behold.  But you're\njust an ugly worm, not good for anything.  While I soar from bloom\nto bloom feasting on nectar, all you can do is creep around and\nchew on a stem.\"\n\n\"What you say may be true,\" replied the caterpillar, \"but my\nMaker must have put me here for some purpose, so I trust him\nfor my future.\"\n\n\"You have no future,\" said the bee.  \"You'll be crawling through the\ndirt for the rest of your life.  If you ask me, you'd be better off\nchoking on a leaf.\"\n\nSometime later the flowers in the garden woke to find that the bee\nand the caterpillar had both disappeared.  All that they could see\nnow was a shriveled yellow body hanging from the edge of a spider\nweb and a magnificent butterfly flexing its wings in the sun.\n\n* This story reminds us that we cannot predict the future, either\nfor others or for ourselves.\n\n*This story teaches us to trust in God rather than in the opinion\nof men.\n\n\n\n\nThe Wise One\n\nHigh in the mountains of a distant land there once lived a man so\nincredibly old that his life no longer had any plot.  He was so old\nthat his very name had faded from the memories of all those around\nhim, and he was known only as \"The Wise One.\"  He spent his later\ndays hearing and commenting on people's problems and sitting among a\ndozen or two disciples who waited patiently to hear all that was\nasked of him and all that he spoke.  Sometimes an entire day would\npass when not a syllable opened his lips; whether this was from a\ntemporary lack of strength or simply because he had nothing to say,\nno one knew.\n\nWhile his reputation among his disciples and a few others was that\nhe possessed amazing wisdom and insight, many people thought him to\nbe an idle and incoherent fool because, they said, he never provided\na practical solution to the problem he was asked about.  Instead he\nwould ask a simplistic question or tell a story whose point was so\nobscure that many left his presence shaking their heads.\n\nSome said that in his youth he had earned and spent large quantities\nof money, only to turn from what he saw as a life of vanity to the\npursuit of wisdom.  Others said that had that been true, he was\nproved all the more fool for giving up the good life for a life of\nhardship that was of little use to anyone.  Thus, for every person\nwho called him The Wise One with reverence, twenty pronounced his\nname with irony.\n\nOf the stories still not erased by the hand of time, consider these\nand judge the man as you will:\n\n*    *    *\n\nOne day a man, clearly troubled by the cares of life, came to The\nWise One and spoke thusly:\n\n\"My son, to whom I had entrusted my farm, last week stole my best\ncows, sold them in the market, and spent the money in wild and\nshameful living.  Now he says he is sorry and will repay me.  What\nshould I do?\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" replied the old man, \"when you drop your bar of soap\nwhile bathing, what do you do?\"\n\n\"I pick it up, of course,\" the man answered, with some irritation.\n\n\"And now tell me, which is of more value, a bar of soap or a\nhuman soul?\"\n\nWhile the questioner left not at all certain about what to do, one\nof The Wise One's disciples, who had been deeply affected by this\nexchange, rose and said, \"Excuse me, O Wise One, but I must go and\nreconcile myself to a man I have wrongly ceased to love.\"\n\n\"Yes, my daughter,\" is all The Wise One said.\n\n*    *    *\n\nAnother time a young couple came to The Wise One to settle a great\nargument.  The old man listened seemingly more politely than\nattentively as each gave a lengthy explanation of the dispute.\nFinally the two looked to The Wise One for his decision, both of\nthem more confident than ever of being right.  The Wise One reached\nover to a vase sitting nearby and pulled out a rose.  \"Shall I hit\nyou with the bloom or with the stem?\" he asked the couple.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" asked the young woman.\n\n\"It is written in the Book of Worn Out Sayings that 'in the rose\ngarden of life he who plucks thorns for his partner's bed is a fool.'\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said the young man.\n\n\"Those who sell flowers put them in a pan of colored water and the\nflowers take on the color of the water,\" concluded The Wise One.  The\ncouple left confused and without resolving their dispute, but they\ndid seem to agree that their trip to The Wise One was worthless.\n\n*    *    *\n\nOn one occasion two men came to The Wise One on the same day.  The\nfirst was a young man unsure about which road to take as he stepped\nout into the world.  \"I have considered my career choices,\" he said,\n\"and I don't know whether to become a poet or a merchant.\"\n\nThe second man had just married a wife and was about to buy a house\nfor them to live in.  \"I have investigated many houses carefully,\"\nhe said, \"and have found two that would be suitable.  The first\nhouse is nearly new and well designed but damp inside, while the\nsecond is light and airy but older and not so well designed.  I\ndon't know which to choose.\"\n\n\"Your problems are one,\" said The Wise One, as he picked up a honey\ncomb and squeezed it until the honey was drained out into a bowl.\n\"You both must choose between the wax and the honey.\"\n\n\"My gosh,\" said one of The Wise One's disciples, leaping to his\nfeet, \"I'm about to marry the wrong girl.\"  And with that, he ran\noff into the distance.\n\nThe two men looked at each other, searching each other's face for a\nglimmer of understanding, which neither found.\n\n*    *    *\n\nOne spring a richly dressed young man came to The Wise One and spoke\nthese words:\n\n\"I have come from a far kingdom where I have just ascended the\nthrone.  My father ruled long and was old when he died, and now I am\nremodeling his castle.  The many books of his great library are in\nthe way of my new banquet hall, and I desire to rid myself of so\nmuch old paper.  But I do not wish to throw out every book.  I want\nto keep some for the sake of his precious memory.  Thus, I have come\nto you for a principle of selection.  Which books should I keep and\nwhich should I burn?\"\n\n\"Go to the ancient source of rock in your kingdom, from which your\ncities have been built,\" answered The Wise One, \"and build a pile of\nstones until you can stand on it and see over the edge of the\nquarry.  Then remove the contemptible stones.\"\n\nWith a look of deep thoughtfulness on his brow, the young ruler left\nthe presence of The Wise One and returned to his kingdom.  It is not\nrecorded whether this advice was put into effect or whether it\nhelped the young ruler with his decision.\n\n*    *    *\n\nThere are many other stories about The Wise One, just as there are\nmany other people with their own stories.  But these shall suffice\nto show how one old man exhausted the meager remnant of his days on\nearth.  Whether his life was spent well or ill perhaps even he\nhimself did not know.\n\n\n\n\nOn the Heroic Suffering of Mankind\n\nA man stood philosophically on the prow of his ship, deeply inhaling\nthe fresh sea air, feeling the warmth of the bright sunshine on his\nface, and ignoring or perhaps not hearing the burst of the whip as\nit lacerated the backs of the struggling slaves in the galley.  But\nin the midst of enjoying his view, he felt a particle of dust fly\ninto his eye.  By blinking and rubbing it a little, he removed the\nspeck, but his eye was reddened.\n\n\"Well,\" he said stoically, \"life has many pains and hardships and we\nmust bear them as best we can.\"  Then relaxing upon a couch and\nordering two slaves to dab his brow with a moistened cloth, he\ncalled upon his friends to sympathize with his suffering, whereupon\nhe found some satisfaction in complaining of his hurt.\n\n\n\n\nThe Quest\n\n     All literature is but a variation on the quest motif. --\n     Someone or Other\n\n     Too busy to look, too busy to be wise. --Someone Else or\n     Someone Other\n\nThere once was a man who wandered from town to town constantly\nexamining the ground.  He carried a lantern in the daytime and a\ncompass at night.  When asked what he was doing, he would answer,\n\"I'm looking for a place to stand, so that when the wind blows I may\nstand and not fall.\"\n\nMost people thought he was insane until a man who had lived long and\nexperienced much was overheard to say of him, \"Only a few people are\nas wise as this man, for he is engaged in the only search that\nreally matters.\"\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\nOne day a man called his friend and invited him to lunch at his\noffice.  \"Just come on over and we'll have a great time,\" the\nman said.\n\n\"Where is your office?\" the friend asked.\n\n\"I'm not sure of the address,\" answered the man, \"but it's somewhere\ndowntown, I think.\"\n\n\"Well,\" asked the friend, \"what does the building look like?\"\n\n\"It's tall, like an office building.\"\n\n\"What floor are you on?\"\n\n\"I think it's one of the middle ones.\"\n\n\"How many doors down from the elevator?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's several.  But I've never really counted them.\"\n\n\"Don't wait for me,\" said the friend, as he hung up.\n\n* This is not a story about a man who could not give directions to\nhis office.  This is a story about the architecture of life.  For\nmany people inhabit their own lives in just this way, not knowing\nwhere they are or how to tell others how to reach them.\n\n\n\n\nDiscernment\n\n\"But compared to the pearls, this piece of string is worthless,\"\nsaid the man, as he pulled it from the necklace and lost his\nwhole treasure.\n\n\n\n\nIt Depends on How You Look at It: Eight Vignettes on Perspective\n\nA man's house burned to the ground.  Upon hearing of it, the man\nsaid angrily, \"This is the fault of oxygen!\"  For, as he explained,\nif there hadn't been any oxygen in the atmosphere, his house never\nwould have burned.\n\n*     *     *\n\nWhen the boss called Smervits and Jenkins into the office, Jenkins\nwas very nervous because his plan to salvage the Freeble contract\nhad not worked.  Smervits wasn't worried because he had shrewdly\nstood by while Jenkins floundered with the contract.\n\n\"Jenkins, you failed,\" the boss said forcefully after the two men\nhad entered.  \"That's good,\" he added, \"because it shows that you\ntried something.  Smervits, you didn't fail, but you didn't try\nanything, either.  You're fired.\"\n\n*     *     *\n\nOne day the power went off in the mine, leaving the miners in\nabsolute darkness.  One miner found a match and lit it.  \"What a\ndinky little flame,\" said one of his companions, with contempt.\n\n\"What a great light in the darkness,\" said another, with awe.\n\n*     *     *\n\n\"Just think,\" said the man in the orange hard hat, \"to us that's just\na useless pile of rock.  But to someone with greater vision it has\nvalue.  It can be changed by his direction into something useful.\"\n\n\"How's that?\" someone asked.\n\n\"First it has to be crushed, and then heated in a furnace, to give\nup its old properties and take on new ones.  Then it can be mixed\nwith water and molded into something beautiful.\"\n\n\"So that's how you make cement, huh?\"\n\n\"No,\" someone said, \"that's how you make a Christian.\"\n\n*     *     *\n\nAn officer came upon a young soldier so weighted down with weapons\nand ammunition that he couldn't move.  \"You know why you aren't\nattacking the enemy, don't you?\" asked the officer.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the soldier.  \"I'm waiting for more ammunition.\"\n\n*     *     *\n\nOnce in a pleasant garden there stood a tree, from which, legend\nsaid, God himself would one day reign.  But instead, a group of\nwicked men broke in and chopped the tree down.  They hacked the tree\ninto a beam and nailed a holy man to it, leaving him to die upon a\nhill.  So the tree of hope now had become a beam covered with blood\nand death.  \"See here,\" the wicked men said, laughing with scorn,\n\"in what manner God's promises are fulfilled.\"\n\n*   *   *\n\nThe chairman of the department asked the young professor how his\nbook was coming along.  Said the professor, \"Oh, the book is already\nwritten; I just haven't put it down on paper yet.\"  The chairman\npatted the man on the back and told him to keep up the good work.\n\nA construction worker, watching this scene transpire, decided that\nwhat was good enough for academe was good enough for him, so he sat\nback and opened a beer.  Presently his foreman came along and wanted\nto know what was going on.  Said the worker, \"Oh, the hole is\nalready dug; I just haven't taken out the dirt yet.\"  The foreman,\nnot having been enlightened by Higher Education, fired the worker,\nright in the middle of his beer.\n\n*   *   *\n\nA man on foot approached an abandoned auto wrecking yard that still\nhad many old pieces of assorted cars lying around.  \"What an\nenormous pile of worthless junk,\" he said to himself as he walked\nby.  The next day another man on foot approached the same yard.\n\"What a wonderful pile of worthy raw materials,\" he thought as he\nsurveyed the area.  A few days later the second man drove away in\nhis own car.\n\n\n\n\nThe Strange Adventure\n\nOnce upon a time, so long ago that it seems like yesterday,\ncircumstances so occurred that two youths found themselves lost\ntogether in the desert and forced to spend the night without the\nservices of modern technology.\n\n\"What a terrible thing,\" said the first one.  \"We're stuck out here\nall alone among who knows what frightening stuff.\"\n\n\"This is great,\" said the other.  \"What an adventure.  I can't wait\nto see what happens.\"\n\nAs the light began to fade, the youths happened upon a snake,\nsitting on a rock to get the last warmth it could find before the\ncold night set in.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" said the first youth.  \"Out here it's just one problem\nafter another.  Now we'll have to worry about that snake crawling\nall over us as we sleep.\"\n\n\"What a great opportunity,\" said the second youth.  \"Now we can have\nsome dinner.\"  Soon the snake was roasting on an impromptu fire, and\nin a little while, the two youths began to eat.\n\n\"This is horrible,\" said the first youth, spitting out the meat and\nnearly vomiting.  \"I can't imagine a worse thing.\"\n\n\"Actually, it tastes rather mild,\" said the second youth, eating\nwith relish.\n\nWhen the next day came and the youths were rescued, they were asked\nabout their adventure.\n\n\"It was the most awful, horrible experience I've ever had,\" said the\nfirst youth, trembling from the memory.  \"I'll be mentally scarred\nby it for the rest of my life.\"\n\n\"It was great!\" said the second youth.  \"I think it's the best thing\nthat ever happened to me.  What a fun time.  I'm so glad I was there.\"\n\n* The events we experience are less important than the meaning we\ngive to them, for life is about meaning, not experience.\n\n\n\n\nIn Defeat There Is Victory\n\nOnce upon a time, among the infinite events which pass daily in this\nworld, a man took his son and daughter to the racetrack to watch the\nhorses run.  After several races, the man announced that he would\nplace a bet.  \"We want to play, too!\" his children cried excitedly.\n\n\"Very well,\" answered the man.  \"Here are the names of the horses in\nthe coming race: 1. Dotty's Trotter; 2. Sure Win; 3. Also Ran; 4.\nHigh Risk; 5. Looking Good; 6. Outside Chance; 7. King Alphonso.\"\n\n\"I want to bet on Sure Win,\" the boy said eagerly.  \"There's nothing\nlike the certainty of success.\"\n\n\"And I will bet on Looking Good; he sounds so handsome and strong,\"\nthe daughter said, with a trace of a sigh.\n\n\"Good, children,\" their father replied, and he went off to place the\nbets for them.\n\n\"Whom did you bet on, daddy?\" the daughter asked when he returned.\n\n\"I bet on Outside Chance,\" he answered.\n\nSoon the race started.  The horses bolted from the gate and took off\nat top speed.  Looking Good looked good around the first turn.\n\"Yay, yay, yay!\" the girl yelled, jumping up and down as the desire\nof her heart moved forward.  \"I'm winning!  I'm winning!\"\n\n\"Patience, my child,\" said her father.  \"In horse racing, unlike in\nlife, we look only at the finish, not at the progress.\"\n\n\"I sure hope that's true,\" the boy said, \"because Sure Win is\nrunning fifth.\"\n\n\"Yes, my son,\" replied his father, trying to soften an inevitable\nblow, \"although you know you cannot gamble and be sure at the\nsame time.\"\n\nAt length the horses came into the final stretch, and, except for\nKing Alphonso, who trailed rather substantially, there were only a\nfew lengths between the leader and the trailing horse.  But in that\nfinal, all-consuming, frenzied gallop, where mere wish and common\neffort give way to inner strength and spiritual power, the spaces\nincreased, so that finally the children, with their feelings crushed\nby the surprise of unexpected failure and by the dismay of dashed\nhope, watched the horses run across the finish line in this order:\n1. Outside Chance; 2. Also Ran; 3. Dotty's Trotter; 4. Sure Win; 5.\nHigh Risk; 6. Looking Good; 7. King Alphonso.\n\nWhile the girl burst into unrestrained sobbing, the boy, feeling the\nfull difficulty of the conflict between youth and manhood, choked\nhis tears back, and knowing his father to be a philosophical type,\ntried to see the metaphorical application of this event.  \"This race\nis an allegory, isn't it, Father?\" he asked, \"where we learn that to\nsucceed we must avoid what appears to be a 'Sure Win' and apply\nourselves instead to the 'Outside Chance.'\"\n\n\"No, my boy,\" the man answered.  \"The lesson is that we should not\npay attention to names and appearances, but that we should penetrate\nbeneath the surfaces of things; that we must consider real\nabilities, evaluate past records, and trust our judgment to bring us\nto a knowledge of the truth.  Appearances and labels are often false\nand seldom accurately reflect inner realities.  We must not let our\ncasual perceptions influence our beliefs or rule our actions.  I bet\non Outside Chance because he previously has consistently\noutperformed the other horses in today's race, or horses that have\nbeat the others.  I care not about his name.  Read where it says\nthat God does not judge by external appearances, and imitate him.\"\n\n\"But I still like Looking Good and I wanted him to win,\" his\ndaughter said perversely, wiping her tears and stamping her foot.\n\"Outside Chance is a creep.\"\n\n\"And now, my daughter,\" said the man, \"you have first felt the\nconflict between reason and passion.  May you learn to resolve\nit well.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Oppressed Girl\n\nThis may seem like a tall story, but there was once a teenage girl\nwho didn't get along with her parents.  \"I'm sick and tired of all\nthese oppressive rules,\" she would complain.  \"I feel just totally\ncontrolled.  I want to be free!\"  So she ran away from home.  \"Now,\"\nshe thought, \"I can stay up all night and listen to loud music and\nwatch awful movies.\"\n\nWhen she told her friends of her new freedom, they said, \"Great!\nLet's celebrate and get drunk.\"\n\n\"Yeah, why not?\" she replied.  \"I can do anything I want.\"  So she\ndrank and laughed and vomited and passed out on the bathroom floor.\n\nA little while later, she met an older girl who seemed to be\nexperienced in the ways of freedom.  \"Hey,\" said the older girl, \"to\nbe free, just take these pills and free your mind from all your\ncares.\"  So the teenage girl took the pills and felt strange and\ndidn't sleep for three days and then closed her eyes and woke up in\nthe middle of the following week.\n\nAnother time she met a young man who seemed to know about the free\nlife.  \"Let me help to liberate you,\" he said, putting his arm\naround her.  And so they went to his van and drove to a vacant lot\nwhere the young man kissed her and \"liberated\" her and told her to\nleave and drove away.\n\nMany days later--days that passed without recognition or\nremembrance--the girl found herself sitting on a bench waiting for a\nbus in the middle of the desert.  As she sat there gazing at the\ndistant mountains, conscious of little more than the rising heat,\nshe heard herself say, \"I don't know what to do.\"\n\n\"Whatever you do will be foolish,\" said a voice from behind her.\n\n\"What?\" the girl asked with some surprise, not sure whether she was\nlistening to a person or a hallucination.  The voice was that of an\nold woman with bony hands.\n\n\"Good decisions come from good values,\" continued the old woman, as\nshe watched her knitting rather than the girl.  \"You have thrown\nyour values away and so your decisions are poor.\"\n\n\"But I wanted to be free,\" the girl answered.\n\n\"There is no freedom without rules,\" the woman said.  \"Without rules\nthere is only slavery.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about me,\" said the girl, her anger rising.  \"I'm\nnot a slave to anyone.  And I can do anything I want to.  So just\nbe quiet.\"\n\nAs she got on the bus to yet one more destination, the girl turned\nback to the old woman and said, \"I'm sorry I got mad.  The truth is,\nI'd do anything to be happy for one hour.\"\n\n\"That pretty well sums up your entire problem,\" the old woman said.\n\n\n\n\nTwo Conversations on Direction\n\n\"And then you turn here to the right.\"\n\n\"Really?  No, I don't think so.  The left path must be the way.\nIt's more attractive, and it somehow just feels right.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, but you have to take the fork to the right.  See the\nlittle sign pointing the way?\"\n\n\"Yes, but something just tells me the left fork is the one to\ntake.  The ground looks better, and that tree up ahead seems\nso persuasive.\"\n\n\"Well, I ought to know the way to my own house.  There is only one\nway, along the right path.\"\n\n\"Uh uh.  The right path looks bad.  I just can't believe it leads to\nyour house.  You probably don't remember correctly.\"\n\n\"You'll get lost if you don't come this way.  The other fork dead\nends.  The only thing there is a swamp, a pit, and a snake.\"\n\n\"It can't be.  It looks so well traveled.  And I have such a feeling\nthat it will take me to your house; I've got to try it.\"\n\n*   *   *\n\n\"Hi.  Hop in.\"\n\n\"Thanks, I appreciate the ride.\"\n\n\"No problem.  Where are you going?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  That's what I want to find out.  Where are you going?\"\n\n\"To San Diego.\"\n\n\"Then where are you going?\"\n\n\"Back home, why?\"\n\n\"And then where are you going?\"\n\n\"Well, oh, I get it.  Then I'm going to rise in the firm and\nbecome president.\"\n\n\"And then where will you go?\"\n\n\"I guess eventually I'll retire.  Say, you feeling all right?  You\nseem a little strange.\"\n\n\"But after you retire, where will you go?\"\n\n\"Well, we all die eventually, so I guess I'll wind up at the cemetery.\"\n\n\"And then where will you go?\"\n\n\"I get it.  You're one of those religious fanatics, right?  I think\nyou'd better find another ride.  You can get out here.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'm going.  But I see you don't know where you're\ngoing, either.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.  I'm going to San Diego.\"\n\n\n\n\nSemiotics Strikes Out\n\nIt so happened in heaven one day that two souls who had been friends\nin their college years on earth met after long lives apart.  After a\nfew minutes of joyous reunion and recounting of their lives, one of\nthe souls realized that they were now in a place where all hearts\ncan be revealed, and where they no longer needed to hide anything.\n\n\"You want to hear something funny, Lissa?\" the soul said.  \"Back\nwhen we were young, I really loved you.  Not having you for my wife\nis the one great regret of my earthly existence.  Pretty silly, huh?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Lissa.  \"I always secretly loved you, too, and\nhoped against hope that someday you might notice me.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you say anything?\"\n\n\"I was too shy.  But I sent you hints.\"\n\n\"Hints?\"\n\n\"Yes, like the brownies I gave you that rainy day in the\nstudent union.\"\n\n\"Oh, or like the chocolate-chip cookies you gave me that one time?\"\n\n\"Well, no, those were only cookies.  I was just being friendly.  But\nthat Christmas when I gave you a coffee mug.  That meant I loved you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know.  That thank-you note you wrote when I fixed your sink\nyou signed, 'Love ya special.'  That was a hint, huh?\"\n\n\"Actually, I signed all my cards and notes that way, so  I was just\nthanking you then.  But remember that note I wrote where I called\nyou a 'weird monster man'?  Boy, how I loved you then.  I wish\nyou'd responded.\"\n\n\"I thought maybe that meant you didn't like me.  I never was good at\nhints.  I remember thinking a few times that some girl was hinting\nthat she liked me but when I would ask her out or mention romance,\nshe'd always look shocked and be dumbstruck with disbelief that I\ncould ever have thought she'd be interested in me.\"  And here the\nsoul sighed, as only souls can sigh.\n\n\"Well, why didn't you just say something to me, like, 'I love you'?\"\nasked Lissa.\n\n\"I was afraid.  And I didn't want to risk destroying our friendship\nby producing unwelcome romantic overtures.  And besides, I sent you\nhints, too.\"\n\n\"Your overtures, as you call them, wouldn't have been unwelcome.\nBut what do you mean you sent me hints?\"\n\n\"I took you out to lunch.\"\n\n\"But you took lots of girls out to lunch.\"\n\n\"That was just for companionship or friendship.  I just liked them,\nbut I loved you.  I thought about you day and night all through\ncollege, and for awhile after graduation, too.\"\n\n\"I wrote you a couple of love letters that I never sent.\"\n\n\"Gosh, I wish you'd said something.\"\n\n\"I wish you'd said something, too.\"\n\n* As we pass through earthly life so quickly and only once, how sad\nthat our fear of rejection is so often stronger than our love.\n\n\n\n\nSeeing is Believing\n\nOne day an idle young man was wandering through the woods not far\nfrom his town when he happened upon an old woman standing around a\nrather smoky fire and stirring a kettle.  Being the modern young man\nthat he was, he immediately blurted out his first impression:\n\n\"Gosh, you're ugly and whatever you're cooking stinks,\" he told her.\n\n\"Well, if you don't like my looks,\" answered the old woman, \"I can\nfix that.\"  She then spoke a few strange words, which were followed\nby a dramatic puff of smoke, and the young man discovered, not that\nthe old woman had transformed herself into a beautiful young maiden,\nbut that the young man could no longer see.\n\n\"Now I've protected you from all ugliness and every unpleasant\nsight,\" said the woman.  \"And you'll remain this way until you can\nfind someone to marry you.  And it will have to be someone who can\nlook beyond externals better than you, because I'm also changing\nyour looks a bit.\"  Here the woman gave a little laugh and uttered a\nfew more unintelligible words.  Soon there was another puff of smoke.\n\n\"Ooh, bummer,\" said the young man, feeling of the new bump on his\nnose and the deep wrinkles now in his cheeks.\n\nWhen the young man returned to town, he quickly discovered that his\nsocial life was now pretty much a historical artifact.  Whenever he\nwent to a party, the reaction was always the same.\n\n\"What's wrong with him?\" some girl would ask.\n\n\"He's gotta look that way until someone marries him,\" would come\nthe reply.\n\n\"Hasn't that plot already been done?\" the girl would say, walking\noff in another direction.\n\nBut, hey, this is a fairy tale and I'm in a good mood so let's say\nthat finally, after many rejections, the young man found a nice girl\nwho actually loved him as he was.\n\nAs the young man got to know her, he kept trying to imagine what she\nlooked like.  After awhile, he constructed a picture of her in his\nmind, so that whenever he looked in her direction, his imagined\nvision of her came before his eyes so vividly that he felt he could\nalmost see her.  He thought that he could very nearly see the slight\ncurve of her lips, the sunlight shining in her hair, the expressions\nof delight or concern on her brow.\n\nWell, anyway, things worked out so well that pretty soon the girl's\nfather was mortgaging his house to pay for the wedding.\n\nWhen the bride and groom awoke on the first day of their honeymoon,\nthe young man discovered that his eyes had been opened.  However, he\nalso discovered that the girl lying beside him did not have the deep\nblue eyes with long eyelashes, or the upturned nose with little\nfreckles of the girl he had been seeing in his mind.  The young\nman, still in the habit of blurting out his first impression, said,\n\"Gosh, you've changed.\"\n\n\"No,\" said his new wife.  \"The only thing that's changed is that now\nyou can see.  Oh, and you no longer have a bump on your nose.\"\n\n\"But where's your blonde hair?\" the young man asked.\n\n\"My hair has always been this color,\" the girl said, fingering her\nchestnut tresses.\n\n\"But you look so different,\" the young man said, still confused.\n\n\"When you looked at me before,\" the girl explained, \"you saw only\nyour imagination.  This is what I'm really like.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said the young man, as he embraced her and began to give\nher a thousand kisses.\n\n\"I know,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\nA Traditional Story\n\nOnce upon a time, several time zones from your house, there lived a\nking who had tons of money, mansions and castles on too many lots,\nplenty of art and cultural treasures, dozens of wives (some of whom\nloved him), and so much power that the mere mention of his name\ncaused cardiac arrest among a considerable number of his subjects.\nBut--he was not happy.  So he called his advisors to him to seek\ntheir advice.\n\n\"My soul troubles me,\" he told his court.  \"I have seemingly a full\nlife, but I do not find happiness here.  In the middle of an\namusement, or when I wake at night, or as I take a bite of rare and\ndelicious food, I feel an overcast sky in my heart.  Help me to\ndispel this cloud.\"\n\n\"Perhaps your majesty would be happy if he had more wealth,\"\nsuggested his treasurer.  So the king increased the taxes on his\npeople, hired traders to go to distant lands to buy and sell, told\nhis workers to redouble their efforts in his precious metals mines\nand minted more coins than ever.  It wasn't long before the king had\nso many storehouses full of treasure that he couldn't even count them.\n\nOn many an occasion his majesty would be riding through a city and\nsee a huge building he didn't recognize, and upon inquiry, discover\nthat it was yet one more warehouse full of his loot.  And let me\ntell you, these warehouses were so glutted with gold and jewels and\ncoins and rich carpets and Old Master paintings and antique vases\nthat when the king wanted to look inside one, the jewels would flow\nout the door like gravel and the coins would spill out like water.\nHis servants got so tired of replacing the excess that they finally\njust began to shovel it into the trash can after the king left.  (Of\ncourse, they probably helped themselves to a little bit of it, too.)\n\nIn his palaces, the king had so much fancy stuff that ancient\nstatues were used as door props in the stables, thousand-year-old\nurns were used as spittoons in the kitchen, and scraps of precious\ncarpets were used to clean the servants' boots.  The point is that\nafter all this additional acquisition, the king's lifestyle was much\nfancier, but the king himself was still not happy.\n\n\"What his majesty needs is activity,\" said the king's culture\nminister.  \"Activity is the rubbing paper that scours the rust from\nthe soul and burnishes her to a new shine.  If the king would just\nengage in some hobbies, he would find contentment.\"  So the king\ntook up some hobbies: hunting, painting, dancing, building (more\nmansions and castles), eating, woodworking, stamp collecting, riding\n(in his golden carriage and on horseback), swimming (in his pool\nfull of pearls), and even knitting.  In all he tried thousands or\nperhaps hundreds of activities, each of them dozens of times.\n\nHe also held athletic contests, built amusement parks, and ransacked\nthe world for jugglers and magicians and singers and players and\nstorytellers (that's how I met him) and musicians.  He ate too much,\ndrank too much, and danced and played and watched and traveled and\ndid too much and basically engaged in a constant frenzy of activity\nfrom morning to night, from January to December, from the beginning\nof the decade to its end.  And the result was that he was amused for\nawhile, but was mostly fat and tired and sometimes drunk and often\ndisoriented, but still not happy.\n\n\"Perhaps your majesty would be happy if he ruled the surrounding\nlands and felt secure from attack,\" suggested the head of his army.\n\"For the proverb says, 'In security lies happiness.'\"  So his\nmajesty instructed his generals to go forth and conquer the\nterritories around him.  After a preposterous quantity of noise,\nsmoke, blood, guts, and dying, the king found himself in possession\nof jillions of acres of farms and towns and houses and cottages and\nthe souls of all those who lived therein.  He now ruled over the\nland as far as he--or even someone with good eyesight--could see in\nevery direction from the top of his highest tower.  At any time of\nday or night the king could call for the relief of a distressed\nfriend or the beheading of an enemy.  He had absolute say over the\nlife or death, the happiness or suffering, of millions of people of\nevery rank and degree, from the most exalted noble in a seaside\nmansion to the most unfortunate street urchin in a grimy and\nstifling hovel.  Such a thought sometimes gave the king half a\nsmile, but he was still not happy.\n\n\"Perhaps what the king needs is love,\" said the eunuch in charge of\nthe king's harem.  \"If he would marry a new variety of ever more\nbeautiful wives, he would perchance find happiness among them.\"  So\nthe king decided to realize this scenario in three dimensions and\nsearched throughout his kingdom for the most desirable women he\ncould find.  He found pretty ones and witty ones and laughing ones\nand moody ones and smart ones and elegant ones and plain ones and\nphilosophical ones and decorated ones--women of every proportion,\nsize, color, personality, and talent, and he married a hundred of\nthem, some of whom loved him even more than those among the first\nfew dozen he was already married to.  And the king found much\npleasure in his wives, but he was still not truly happy.\n\n\"The king will find happiness only in wisdom,\" said one of the\nking's scholars.  \"For it is written that 'truth is a joy unto\nitself.'\"  So the king applied himself to books of wisdom, and to\nseeking the knowledge of all his many scholars and sending\nthroughout all his realm to find the wise from every land.  Dozens\ncame and dozens pretended to instruct him in wisdom or in the way to\nhappiness, but while he found some really good advice and some\nsatisfying rules for life, happiness still eluded him.\n\nThen one day came a woman from a land beyond the sunrise.  Her words\nwere few but they so affected those who listened that she was\nimmediately granted an audience with the king, who explained the\ndiscontent of his condition.\n\n\"Here before me,\" he said, \"it would seem that I have everything a\nman could want.  I have three or four rings on every finger, I can\ncaress a beautiful woman's hair in any color, I can ride a week in\nany direction and find my statue erected and feared, and I can hear\nany melody or see any play at my command.  I possess or can do or\nenjoy everything I can imagine, and everything that the most\ncreative of my servants can imagine.  And yet I find that happiness\nis nowhere to be found.  I am always rankled by a feeling of\ndissatisfaction and haunted by an awareness of emptiness.\"\n\n\"Truly, his majesty's desires seem to be infinite,\" said one of his\ncourtiers, scarcely more able to hide his disgust than his envy.\n\n\"His majesty's desires are indeed infinite,\" said the woman.  \"For\nthat is the nature of the human heart.  The heart's deepest desires\ncannot be satisfied by any finite thing.\"\n\n\"Then what am I to do?\" asked the king with dismay.\n\n\"You must seek the Infinite,\" the woman said.\n\n\"And where can I find it?\" he asked.  \"What form does it take?\"\n\n\"The Infinite is not a thing or in a particular place,\" said the\nwoman.  \"But seek Him and you will find happiness.\"\n\nWhen the people saw that the woman was returning to her land, they\nasked what she had said to the king.\n\n\"She reminded us of what we had forgotten,\" said one of the king's\nscholars, \"that we are but travelers through an ephemeral landscape,\nand that on a journey through a desert, we should not expect to find\nhappiness from fingering the grains of sand in the dunes.  We find\nhappiness by finding our way home.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Day Creativity Met the Linear Dragon\n\nIt was a winter's rainy day when the new Vice President for Design\nConcepts (who had just been promoted from Senior Accountant because\nhe could calculate to the nearest nickel how much a new car would\ncost to build) noticed that two of his employees, a young man and a\nyoung woman, were not at their desks.  Upon inquiring, he was told\nthat they had \"gone to the loft to be creative.\"  The Vice President\n(who could remember the part number of every component he had ever\ntouched) calmly adjusted his bow tie, cleared his throat, checked to\nsee that his shoelaces were still tied, and then strode briskly down\nthe long corridor of the half-remodeled automobile factory.  Soon he\nwas walking up the stairs to the loft, only to arrive at a door\nmarked, \"Do Not Disturb.\"\n\nViewing the sign as an affront to his authority, he applied Chapter\nTwo of the assertiveness training book he had just finished and\nquickly opened the door with determination and a scowl.\n\nWhat he saw was not what he expected.  Near the door was a boom box,\nplaying very lively but not overly loud classical music.  Directly\nin front of him across the room he saw the young woman, barefoot and\nwearing, instead of her business attire, purple sweatpants and a\ntorn green sweatshirt.  Worse than this, she was turning cartwheels\nand saying what sounded to him like, \"Put it in the lake, dip it,\nwater proof it, French dip it, soak it, drench it, pinch it, wrench\nit.\"  When she stopped to attend to his interruption, he noticed that\nher hair was rubber banded into a vertical column on top of her head.\n\nThe young man was sitting off to one side, wearing jeans and a\nT-shirt printed with the words, \"None of the Above.\"  Nearby was an\nopen ream of copier paper, many sheets of which he had evidently\nwrinkled up into a ball and tossed at a trash can a few feet away,\nwith highly indifferent accuracy.  A few of the sheets had been\nwritten on with multicolored felt-tip pens and placed carelessly in\nseveral piles.\n\n\"What's going on here?\" demanded the Vice President.\n\n\"We work here,\" said the young man.\n\n\"Not any more you don't,\" said the Vice President sternly.  \"Just\nwhat do you think you're doing, anyway?\"\n\n\"We're working on the new Blister DLX,\" said the young woman.\n\n\"I don't see any work being done here,\" the Vice President\nshot back.\n\n\"We're thinking,\" the young woman said.\n\n\"This doesn't look like thinking to me.\"\n\n\"Oh?  And what does thinking look like to you?\" asked the young man.\n\n\"Well, it certainly doesn't look like this.  This is goofing\noff--and stop wasting that paper.  Who are you, anyway?\"\n\n\"I'm Scott and this is Tina,\" the young man said.  \"We're creative\nanalysts.  We're working on cost-cutting ideas.\"\n\n\"Cost cutting?\" sneered the Vice President.  \"You don't even have a\ncalculator.  And besides, we've got engineers and accountants to cut\ncosts, so even if you were doing that, you'd be either superfluous\nor redundant.  I want you out of the plant by this afternoon.\"\n\nThat afternoon Scott and Tina went to the Vice President's office.\nAs Scott stretched out on the floor and began to spread out a few\npapers, Tina pushed aside many feet of adding machine tape and sat\nin the Lotus position on one end of the Vice President's desk.  The\nVice President was not quite so upset that he did not notice that\nTina was wearing earrings made from crumpled balls of paper hanging\nfrom bent paper clips.  \"We'd like to ask you to reconsider your\nfiring us,\" said Tina.  \"We have some good ideas for the Blister.\"\n\n\"Get out,\" said the Vice President.\n\nThe next day all the executives met at a regularly scheduled\nadministrative meeting, where there seemed to be some confusion and\ndelay in getting started.  Finally, the President of the company\nspoke up.  \"I'm sorry for the delay,\" he said, \"but we had scheduled\na report on cost saving ideas by two of our top creative analysts\nand it now appears that some idiot fired them yesterday.  However,\nwe are in the process of getting everything straightened out, and\nthey should be here soon.\"\n\n\"I hope it's Scott and Tina,\" one of the other executives said.\n\"They're really brilliant.\"\n\n\"If unconventional,\" noted another.\n\n\"Unconventional or not,\" said the Chief Operating Officer, \"I'll\nnever forget how they saved us eighty-six million dollars on the\nDazzle II by helping us reduce the number of parts.  And when their\nexpense account came through, all they'd bought were radio batteries\nand a couple of reams of paper.\"\n\n\"I remember that,\" said the first executive.  \"No fancy research, no\ncostly experiments, just pure thought, just great ideas.  They\nactually know how to think.\"\n\n\"What kind of a jerk would fire people like that?\" someone asked.\n\nAnd so it was that the new Vice President for Design Concepts was\ninvited to take his skills to some other company, even though he\ncould recite the exact cost of every part of every car the\ncorporation made.\n\n\n\n\nThe Wall and the Bridge\n\nIn the high country of a far away land there once stood a massive\nwall, blocking the pass between two mountains.  Just below the wall\nwas a path leading around the mountains--a path made possible by\na bridge connecting it across a deep chasm directly in front of\nthe wall.\n\nNow, the wall and the bridge were always bickering.  One day when an\nold peddler leading an even older mule with a load of shabby wares\ncrossed the bridge on the way to a distant fair, the wall said to\nthe bridge, \"You know, the trouble with you is that you have\nabsolutely no discretion.  You let just anyone walk over you.  In\nfact, you're the slut of architectural forms, granting promiscuous\nentry to all and sundry.\"\n\n\"Is the greenness I see all over you moss or envy?\" replied the\nbridge.  \"I enable people to fulfill their dreams; I provide\nopportunity for a better life.  You're just an obstructionist, but\nI'm a facilitator--a metaphor for access, for hope, for possibility.\"\n\nOn another day a young maiden fleeing evil men ran across the rocks\nuntil she reached the wall where she could go no farther.  She cried\nout and pounded her fists against the wall in despair until the men\ncaught up with her and carried her away.  The bridge then said to\nthe wall in disgust, \"You once accused me of having no discretion,\nbut you are worse, for you are completely heartless.  You're so cold\nand rigid that you cruelly prevent even the distressed and needy\nfrom passing by.  Maybe that's why walls are known everywhere as\nsymbols of 'No!' while we bridges are known as symbols of 'Yes!'\"\n\n\"You, my loose and easy friend,\" said the wall, \"indeed let the\ndistressed pass, but you also let the criminals pass.  I, on the\nother hand, provide the needed security to keep the land behind me\nsafe from harm.  I am a protector, and I defend this pass and the\ncountry well.\"\n\nThis dialogue continued for many years until one morning when\nsuddenly the earth shook with great violence.  So strong was the\ntremor that both the wall and the bridge were reduced to rubble at\nthe bottom of the chasm.  Not many months later men came to repair\nthe damage.  In the process of reconstruction, however, the stones\nthat were once part of the bridge were used to rebuild the wall\nand the stones that were once part of the wall were used to rebuild\nthe bridge.\n\n\"Now I'll show you what a wall should really be like,\" said the new\nwall.  \"It shouldn't be cold and rejecting to everybody.\"  And so at\nfirst, the new wall let many people climb up over it.\n\n\"And I'll show you what a bridge should do,\" said the new bridge.\n\"It shouldn't let just anybody across.\"  And so at first, the new\nbridge provided a difficult passage, causing many travelers to trip\non the surface and a few even to fall over the edge.\n\nBut as spring and summer, harvest and winter came and went again and\nagain, the rocks on the new wall grew more and more slippery and the\nlittle projections gradually broke away, so that climbing  over or\neven getting a foothold became very difficult.  And in the same\npassage of time, the rough spots on the new bridge wore down and the\ncrevices filled up, so that passage across became much easier.\n\n\"You see,\" said the new bridge to the new wall, \"you've learned\nsomething about being a wall.\"\n\n\"Well,\" the new wall replied, \"I've known all along that I must\nguard the pass and fortify the defenses of the country.  And of\ncourse I know it's my job to keep out all those who don't belong.\nBut I see you've finally discovered how to be a bridge.\"\n\n\"You can say what you like,\" answered the new bridge.  \"But I've\nalways understood that I provide a critical link in the path\naround the mountains, and that my purpose is to help travelers\nacross the gorge.\"\n\nAs the years collected, as years do, the new bridge and the new wall\nbegan to think less and less about what they had once been and more\nand more about the task they currently had to do, until eventually\nit became impossible for anyone to tell that the new wall had once\nbeen a bridge or that the new bridge had once been a wall.\n\n\"How indiscriminate and common you are,\" the new wall would often\ntell the new bridge.\n\n\"And how inflexible and repressive you are,\" the new bridge\nwould reply.\n\n\n\n\nThe Wish\n\nWhile walking along the beach one day, a man spotted an old,\nbarnacle-covered object which on closer examination he discovered to\nbe an ancient bronze oil lamp.  \"Hah!  Aladdin's lamp,\" he thought,\njokingly. \"I'll rub it.\"  To his surprise, when he did rub it, a\ngenie appeared.\n\n\"Okay, Bud,\" said the genie, in a remarkably bored tone.  \"You have\none wish--anything you want.  What is it?\"\n\n\"Money,\" the man said instantly, his eyes widening.  \"Yes!  Endless\nmoney.  Riches!  Wealth!  Ha! Ha!  Huge, massive, obscene wealth!\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" said the genie in the same bored tone.\n\n\"No, wait,\" the man said, his eyes suddenly narrowing.  \"Power.  Yeah,\nthat's it.  Complete and total power over everyone and everything\nin the world.  With power I could get all the money I wanted.\"\n\n\"So you want power, huh?\" asked the genie.\n\n\"Well, yes,\" said the man, now a bit hesitant because of the genie's\nless-than-enthusiastic tone.  \"Of course, with money I suppose I\ncould buy power.  Which do you think I should ask for, Genie?\"\n\n\"How about world peace or personal humility or an end to famine or\nmaybe an end to greed,\" suggested the genie, emphasizing the last\nphrase.  \"Or perhaps the gift of discernment or knowledge or\nspiritual enlightenment or even simple happiness.\"\n\n\"But with money or power I could buy or command all those,\" objected\nthe man.\n\n\"Yeah, sure,\" said the genie.\n\n\"Well, just give me power and I'll show you that I can have\neverything else, too.\"\n\n\"You shall have what you ask,\" said the genie resignedly.  \"Whether\nyou shall have what you imagine you must learn for yourself, and you\nwill soon find out.\"\n\n\"Well, I certainly hope to have it all.  Don't you ever hope, Genie?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the genie.  \"I hope that someday my lamp will fall into\nthe hands of a wise man.\"\n\nAnd so the man was given power over everything on earth, over every\ngovernment, every event, every activity of every soul.  As a result,\nhis name was soon pronounced with hatred and contempt by everyone,\nand in a few months he was assassinated by his most trusted followers.\n\n\n\n\nSeveral One Way Conversations\n\n\"Yes, they are shackles, but they are made of gold,\" said the man, as\nhe asked for another pair on his wrists and two more on his ankles.\n\n*    *    *\n\n\"You can see how great I am by observing what I have done,\" said the\nchisel to the other tools, as they gazed upon the beautiful statue.\n\n*    *    *\n\n\"My word is as good as my check,\" said the forger, as he handed over\npartial payment and promised to pay the balance later.\n\n*    *    *\n\n\"May you get everything you want,\" said the philosopher to his enemy,\nknowing that his enemy would not recognize his words as a curse.\n\n*    *    *\n\n\"I'll teach this dirt not to muddy my shoes,\" said the man,\nshoveling madly, only soon to discover himself in a pit.\n\n*    *    *\n\n\"Now I see how essential material things are,\" said the man, as he\nlooked at the ashes of his burned down house.\n\n*    *    *\n\n\"How dare you, who are nothing but a low worm, try to tell me what\nto do,\" said the man, as he stood there unmoving, just before the\npiano landed on him.\n\n\n\n\nHow the King Learned about Love\n\nBack in the days of knights and chivalry and courtly love, a\nbeautiful young woman fell in love with a man of noble birth, who,\nhowever, was already married.  Their love continued to grow until\nthe woman granted and the man took more than virtue could properly\ncountenance and one morning the woman awakened with the right to use\nthe pronoun \"we\" whenever she spoke.\n\nShe realized that she could not inform her lover because of his\nposition, for he was not only married but also a very prominent\nmember of the court.  So she concealed the matter remarkably over\nmany months, until, in the fullness of time, it could be concealed\nno longer.  At that point she resolved to throw herself on the mercy\nof her mistress, the king's daughter, to whom she was a lady in\nwaiting.  She took her newborn son to the princess and begged quite\npathetically for her help.\n\nThe king's daughter, knowing that he was a hard man who had never\nhesitated to crush, kill, or otherwise persecute anyone who offended\nhim in the slightest, realized that she could not tell the truth or\nsay simply that the child had been found during one of the princess'\nwalks, because the king would then send it to a harsh life in an\norphanage--and that would be if she found him in a good mood.  She\ndecided instead to declare to the king that the child was her own\nand take the guilt, together with any other consequences, upon\nherself, for she loved her lady in waiting very much.\n\nWhen the king learned that his daughter had given birth (or so he\nbelieved), he was unutterably furious, and spent the better part of\nan hour ranting and shouting execrations and breaking things.  But\nwhen he demanded which of his knights had helped her into this\nsituation, the princess, not willing to sacrifice any of the noble\nand completely innocent knights of the castle, invented the story of\na secret lover from outside the castle walls.\n\nThe king suspected that his daughter was lying, or trying to\nlie--for the girl was so honest that she could not dissemble with\nconviction--so that he was now even more uncontrollably enraged than\nbefore; he now began screaming directly at his daughter and breaking\nlarger and more expensive things.  And because he could think of\nnothing but her duplicity and disobedience and his injured honor and\nher betrayal of his affection, he coldly (or rather hotly)\ndetermined to banish her from the kingdom.  \"For,\" he argued, \"I\nwill love not those who love not me.\"  He therefore cruelly turned\nthe girl and the child over to the traders of a passing caravan from\na distant land who would take them past the borders of the kingdom.\n\nEven as she saw her father's look of hatred as she was packed into\nthe wagon at the rear of the caravan, the princess did not alter her\nresolve to keep her secret, for now she knew that if the king knew\nthe truth, her lady in waiting would most certainly be executed.  As\nfor the lady in waiting, she was so stricken with grief over the\nking's actions that she very nearly took her own life.  But the\nprincess had commanded her never to reveal the secret, regardless of\nthe consequences, and the lady in waiting feared that the princess\nwould be exposed by such an action.  So the woman, helpless to\nremedy the situation, instead fled the palace in tears.\n\nAs the traders proceeded out of the kingdom, the princess resolved\nthat, whatever should happen to herself, she would not see the child\ngrow up a slave.  She therefore watched carefully for an opportunity\nand one night sneaked off from the traders as far as she could get\nin the cold and dark, and put the child near a hut, hoping and\npraying that it would find safety and a free life, however humble.\nShe then sneaked back to the traders, and pretended to be cuddling\nthe baby in her arms.\n\nThe caravan traveled two full days before her deception was\ndetected.  When it was, the princess once again played audience to\nviolent anger.  The traders yelled and cursed the girl; then they\nbeat her with fists and even with sticks, accompanied by more curses\nand threats; but nothing they could do could force her to tell what\nshe had done with the baby.  The traders, remembering the promises\nmade to them by the king to encourage the secrecy of their charges,\nand fearing the consequences of a breach of that secrecy, sent\nriders back over the route they had traveled, to search everywhere.\n\nMeanwhile an old woodcutter, who lived in the hut with his wife,\nfound the baby and brought it inside.  As they looked upon the\nbeautiful, healthy child, their eyes shone with a sparkle that they\nthought had long ago disappeared forever.  But even in their\ndelight, they recognized immediately that the child was no ordinary\nfoundling, for it had noble features and was wrapped in silks and\nwore a gold brooch with a white lily on it.\n\nThey soon recognized that the child would need better fare than the\nrough crusts and ordinary water the couple subsisted on--for they\nwere extremely poor--so they began to wonder how they could take\ncare of it.\n\n\"We could pick some of our neighbor's fruit at night,\" suggested the\nwoman, \"or perhaps sell the gold brooch.\"\n\n\"Or we could cheat the king the next time he buys wood,\" said the\nwoodcutter sarcastically.  \"But we won't do any of those things.\nYou know that it isn't right to do wrong, even to bring good.  God\nhas brought us this child; I pray that he will help us feed it.\"\n\nNow, the old woodcutter had been saving a few coins from his meager\nearnings over the past three years in order to buy himself a new axe\nhead in the spring.  \"But,\" he thought to himself, \"I suppose I\ncould sharpen this old head one more season, and with a little\nlonger handle, it ought to be good enough to get my by.\"  So he took\nthe money he had saved and gave it to his wife, instructing her to\nbuy the child proper food and raiment.\n\nThe old woman was so moved by this sacrifice that she took off her\nlocket--other than her wedding ring the only piece of jewelry she\nowned, and an heirloom from her great grandmother, at that--and\ncontributed it to the welfare of the child.  \"For,\" she said, \"I was\nnever so foolish as to believe that love had no price.\"\n\nJust a few days later a rider from the traveling caravan arrived,\nand visited the woodcutter's neighbor.  Because the woodcutter was\nnot far away at the time, he overheard the conversation.  \"Have you\nseen anyone with a baby in the past week?\" demanded the rider roughly.\n\n\"Who's asking?\" asked the neighbor, without excessive politeness.\nAs the woodcutter heard the angry, cursing, threatening reply of the\nrider, he ambled back to his hut to inform his wife of what was\ngoing on.  The couple was quite shrewd enough not to reveal anything\nto a rude, angry, and ill-dressed man on horseback, because, they\nconcluded that, however deficient their own hospitality to the\nchild, it was likely to be better than whatever would be offered by\nsuch a ruffian.  \"And besides,\" the woodcutter's wife said, \"I\nalready love the child too much to give him up.\"\n\nAs the days passed, the old couple grew thoroughly attached to the\nbaby.  They both found themselves unexpectedly humming little tunes\nor smiling for no apparent reason, and they both found their chores\nsuddenly lighter and easier.  They worked faster, eager to finish\nand once again spend some time playing with the child.\n\nHowever, it wasn't many weeks before the old woodcutter and his wife\nwere forced to admit that they were simply too old and too poor to\nraise the child as it should be, and that they ought in all fairness\nto the babe to find a better home for it.  \"For,\" as the old woman\nexplained, \"I love the child too much to keep him.\"\n\nSo the woodcutter took the child to a house where several holy women\nlived and, after explaining the brief history of the child as he\nknew it, asked for their help.  \"The wife and I don't have the\nlearning behind us, the money with us, or the years ahead of us to\nraise this child as it ought to be raised,\" said the woodcutter to\nthe matron of the house, \"so we'd appreciate it if you could find it\na proper home.\"\n\n\"Our small endowment provides us with only a modest living,\" the\nmatron said, \"but we will care for the child until we can find out\nwhom it belongs to, or until we can find it a good home.\"  So the\nman left the child with them and went on with his wood cutting.  The\nmatron of the house assigned care of the child to one of the newest\nof the holy women, who could nurse it.\n\nAbout this season in the kingdom, the queen gave birth to a son\nalso.  The child, however, was weak and sickly, and failed to\nflourish.  In just a few weeks it developed a fever and died\nsuddenly in the night.  The queen, in addition to her grief, was\nfrantic with anxiety, knowing that the king was such a hard man that\nif he knew his only son had died, he would hate the queen and\nperhaps divorce her.  So she sent, with the utmost secrecy, a\ntrusted servant to find another child to replace the one she had\nlost.  \"Bring me a child with no past,\" she told her servant, \"and I\nwill give it a future.\"\n\nFinding such a child was a tiring and frustrating task for the\nservant, and he met with humiliation and rejection and insult and\nfalse leads and failure at every turn.  But since this story is not\nabout him, nor about the rewards of perseverance, let us say simply\nthat eventually he found himself at the door of the holy order of\nwomen we have mentioned above.\n\n\"Yes, we do have such a child as you seek,\" the matron told him.\n\"We were keeping him until we could find his parents, or until we\ncould find him a good home.  Perhaps your mistress, whoever she is,\nwill care for him well.\"  The servant assured the matron that this\nwould be so and gave her a large gift to maintain the house and its\ncharitable work.  As she handed him the child, she said, \"The woman\nwho has been nursing the child says that this parting is like a\ndeath to her, for she has become very attached to him.  But she\nloves him too much to think of her feelings.  I hope that what is a\nsadness for her will be a happiness for the child.\"\n\n\"Truly, good woman,\" replied the servant, \"it is rightly said that\nthe death of every fruit is the seed of new life.  Every ending is\nalso a beginning.\"\n\nAs the years passed, the baby grew up into a fine, strong young man.\nThe king, who remained crusty and harsh toward everyone else,\nchanged completely when his son (as he supposed) entered the room.\nThe king became actually friendly and laughed some and often engaged\nin animated conversation with the young prince.  The king was often\nheard to say that he would never let the prince part from him even\nfor a day but that the prince should be his always.  They often rode\non horseback through the forest all day or sat together by the fire\nuntil the servants fell asleep, discussing the kingdom and enjoying\neach other's company.\n\nWhen the prince reached his early manhood, the king not only took\nhim into confidence on affairs of state, but began to share power\nwith him, knowing that not many more years would pass before there\nwould necessarily be a new king.  Many of the king's decisions were\nnow submitted to the prince before they were made, and the prince,\nto his credit, frequently moderated the king's stern and often\ncruel decrees.\n\nBy this time, the queen was in poor health, troubled by constant\npain and a lingering cough.  Everyone at the court eventually\nrecognized that she was about to die.  For several days the queen\ndebated with herself whether or not to let the secret of the prince\ndie with her, but at last, showing the heritage of her daughter's\nhonesty, she decided that she must reveal it to the king.\n\nBy the time she reached this decision, the queen was truly on her\ndeathbed, so she called the king to her and sat up weakly.  \"My\nking,\" she began, \"I have a matter to disclose to you that has\nburdened my heart for many years.  It concerns the prince.\"  And\nhere she hesitated for a few moments.  The king waited in silence.\n\"You,\" she continued, \"are not his father.\"\n\nThe king, immediately concluding that the sanctity of his marriage\nbed had been violated, exploded into a rage that would likely have\nended the queen's suffering prematurely had she not added as loudly\nas she could, \"And I am not his mother.\"  The king then, though\nstill in shock, calmed himself enough to hear her explanation of the\ndeath of their natural son and her subterfuge in adopting the child\nwho was now the prince.  The king at first gave little credit to\nthis tale, thinking that the queen was either delirious or scheming\nagainst him and his beloved son in some way.  But he sent attendants\nto the holy order to discover the truth.  They soon returned with the\nmatron of the house and the woman who had nursed the prince as a baby.\n\n\"If what the queen tells me is true,\" said the king, \"I have no\nhappiness, no reason to live.  For the only thing I love has been\ntaken away.\"\n\nThe matron from the holy order solemnly attested to the truth of the\nqueen's story.  \"The prince was indeed the baby given us by the\nwoodcutter so many years ago,\" she said.  As the king felt a wave of\ndespair washing over him, the nurse from the holy order came forward\nand spoke.\n\n\"With all deference to my Lady and to her majesty,\" she said, \"the\nqueen is only half correct.  For the child was indeed not hers, but\nhe is the king's son.\"  She then pulled back the cowl of her robes,\ntook down her hair and showed the king her face.  Even  through the\nravages of two decades, the king could still clearly see the face of\nhis daughter's lady in waiting, his lover who had borne his child\nwithout his knowledge so many years ago.  The lady briefly explained\nwhat had happened then and how she had immediately recognized the\nchild when the woodcutter brought it to the holy house.\n\n\"You willingly gave me your son, even though I was evil?\" the king\nasked in disbelief.\n\n\"I loved you,\" the lady in waiting said simply.  \"And I loved my\nson--our son--more.\"\n\nWhen he realized how unjust and hypocritical he had been toward the\nlady, the princess, and the queen, the king was so overwhelmed with\nshame and humiliation that he fell to his knees and began pulling on\nhis hair and sobbing loudly.  His crying was the only sound in the\nroom until the queen spoke.\n\n\"I forgive you, my husband and my king,\" she said.  \"And I love you.\"\n\n\"You love me?\" the king asked, rising and turning to her with\nastonishment.  \"You love me after I have banished your daughter and\nproven unfaithful to you?\"  But there was no answer, for the queen\nhad already closed her eyes for the last time.\n\nThe king stood as one who had been stunned.  He could not speak or\nthink.  As he sat down in a stupor at the foot of the queen's bed,\nthe prince suddenly spoke. \"I have found a mother today,\" he said.\n\"I must now find a sister, too.  I shall leave immediately in\nsearch of her.\"\n\n\"No!\" the king yelled, standing up.  But then, recollecting himself,\nhe said, \"No, you're right.  You must go from me and find your sister.\"\n\nIn the days to come, as the king sat alone in his richly tapestried\nrooms, he had many hours to think over the events that had formed\nhis life and to ask himself whether there was not in love some\nquality that can be shown only in sacrifice, not in advantage; only\nin surrender, and not in triumph.\n\n\n\n\nThe Fly and the Elephant\n\nA fly sat on an elephant's back.  When the elephant shuffled down a\ndirt road, the fly said, \"What a dust we are making!\"  When the\nelephant trudged knee-deep in the mud, the fly said, \"How heavy\nwe are!\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Man Who Talked Backwards\n\nThere was once a bizarre old philosopher who always seemed to say\nthe opposite of what those who sought his advice expected.  So\ncontrary were his words that he was known as The Man Who Talked\nBackwards.  His blessing on those he loved was, \"May you have\ndifficulty in this life,\" and his bitterest curse on his enemies\nwas, \"May your life pass without a single sorrow.\"  Whenever someone\nasked him what course of learning to undertake in order to increase\nhis knowledge, the philosopher would reply, \"If you want to learn\nsomething, become a teacher.\"  Whenever some grateful hearer would\nask how he could repay the philosopher for his advice, he would\nalways answer, \"The best way to repay a debt to me is to cancel a\ndebt owed to you.\"\n\nThe Man Who Talked Backwards reversed even the most common of\nproverbs.  Instead of repeating that \"to love is to be patient,\" he\nwould always quote, \"To be patient is to love.\"  Rather than noting\nthat \"seeing is believing,\" he would say, \"Believing is seeing.\"\nFor, he explained, what you believe controls what you see.\n\nA young woman once asked him, \"What can I do to make someone my\nfriend?  Shall I oil my skin or brush my hair?\"\n\n\"Rather you should oil the skin and brush the hair of the one you\nlike,\"  answered the philosopher.\n\nAnother day a young scholar approached The Man Who Talked Backwards\nand asked him what books he should read, \"For,\" the student said, \"I\nrealize that the more I read the more I will know.\"\n\n\"You will indeed learn something by reading,\" answered the\nphilosopher, \"but the more you read the less you will know.  That is\nwhat makes reading of value.\"\n\n\"But how shall I know what beliefs I should hold in order to live\nthe best life?\" the young scholar asked.\n\n\"You think that your beliefs shape your actions,\" replied the\nphilosopher, \"but I tell you, it is your actions that shape\nyour beliefs.\"\n\nOne day a woman came to the Man Who Talked Backwards for advice.\n\"I know,\" she said, \"that 'to live is to choose,' so I have come\nhere to discover how I might fix my choices to live a fuller, more\nproductive life.\"\n\n\"The better saying,\" said the philosopher, \"is that 'to choose is to\nlive.'  But if you want to live life more fully, do less.\"\n\n\"Do less?\" the woman asked with surprise.  \"But I'm an achiever.  I\nthrive on accomplishment.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you have already diluted your life into meaninglessness,\"\nsuggested the philosopher.\n\n\"But I'm easily bored,\" said the woman.\n\n\"I am truly sorry,\" said the philosopher.  \"Did you ever seek help\nfor yourself?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"For your infirmity of being bored.\"\n\n\"My infirmity?\" asked the woman, again surprised.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the philosopher, \"You attribute your boredom to others or\nto external circumstances.\"\n\n\"Well, of course,\" she said.\n\n\"In that case, I am sorry for your two infirmities.\"\n\n\"But I want to get as much out of life as I can,\" the woman\nprotested.  \"You philosophers all say that one's life does not\nconsist in material things because they disappear, but what then can\nI gain that I can keep?\"\n\n\"The only thing that you can really keep--and keep forever--is what\nyou give away,\" said the philosopher.\n\nLate one afternoon a blunt young man came up to The Man Who Talked\nBackwards and asked him, \"Now that you are old and about to drop\ndead, do you look forward to death or fear it--or perhaps I should\nask, Did you live a good life or a bad one?\"\n\n\"It is not one's life that determines his view of death,\" replied the\nphilosopher, \"but one's view of death that determines how he lives.\"\n\n\"So you are ready to end your life?\" asked the blunt young man.\n\n\"Death is not an end to life, as you suppose,\" said the philosopher.\n\"This world is but a mirror that reverses everything as it reflects\nit.  Death therefore is merely the shattering of a mirror.\"\n\n\"Your mirror already has a large crack in it,\" said the blunt young\nman, with a laugh.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the philosopher.\n\n\n\n\nThe Clue\n\nIn every civilization, someone has to put up the signs that guide us\non our way.  --Proverb\n\nSometimes they had to drill the post holes up on Rocky Bluff--and it\nwas a tough dig, what with the rocks and the hardness of the soil.\nThey came home plenty tired and dirty on those days.  Other times\nthey drilled the holes down in Sandy Meadow, where the augur slipped\nin smoothly, quickly, and easily.  They all praised the meadow and\nsaid how great it was to get an assignment to put up some signs\nthere.  And yet, when they told the stories of their lives--the\nstories that animated their faces and brightened their eyes--they\nalways seemed to be speaking of Rocky Bluff.\n\n\n\n\nAn Analogy\n\nAs he clung to the sheer face of the rock, he could hear in his mind\nthe voice of his climbing instructor:  \"If you make even a slight\nmistake, you will die instantly.\"  He knew then that he need not\ndebate whether to be attentive in his climb.  And he was glad also\nthat God is like a rock only in his steadfastness.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRobert Harris was born in Los Angeles, California in 1950.
